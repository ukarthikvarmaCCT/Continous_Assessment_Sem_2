 Arunima Sinha, who hoisted the victory flag on Everest, the highest peak of the Himalayas, likes Junoon more than Everest
 unka junun hi he, jisane baayan pair na rahete hue bhi unhen everest kii oonchai chune main kamyaabi dilaai
 Here is the story of his bravery and success - "main safalataa ke aasmaan par hum, everest ke upar hum
 i have got what i have wished for
 mere pairon ne bhi meraa puraa saath diya
 What happened is i don't have my own left leg
 
 The paralyzed feet did not even allow the feeling of defeatism
 
 What a foot, i would have been here even if i had nothing else
 oonchai hi mujhe pukaarti he, mere buland iraadon ko koi chhu bhi nahin saktaa, mujhe koi roak bhi nahin saktaa
 i wanted to play volleyball-football, wanted to be a hockey champion, but my cut leg prevented me from going to rules tied to the law
 log kehete hai ki kanoon pairon main bandhi hui bediyon ke samaan hote hai, mere paas to ek pair bhi nahin tha, lekin parvat par chadhane se mujhe koun roak saktaa tha
 When i first expressed my heartfelt desire to conquer Everest, what a joke people had made
 aaj ve hi log dekh len ki main kahaan par hum
 
 are, pairon se chalakar manzil milti hoti to arabon log apni manjilon par pahunch gaye hote, yah to hausala hota he jo aapako kahin bhi panhucha detaa he
 Like i am here today under white snow covered hills and clear blue sky, Jai Bajrangbali
 
 ! naam meraa he arunima sinha
 i am also called Sonu
 main bahut prasiddh nahin hum lekin do saal pehle mere saath jo haadasa hua tha, usase mujhe pahchaan mili
 That identity was not of any good faith nor did i do any good
 vah badanaami thi
 But what was my fault? main uttar pradesh ke ambedkarnagar jile ke kshetrana (shajadpur) mohalle kii hum
 The truth is that we are originally from Bihar
 pita fouj main the or ham log sultanpur aa gaye the
 But when i was four years old, my father died
 meraa ek chota bhai he or badi bahan lakshmi
 You can understand what is the condition of a family without a father
 meri maa ambedkarnagar aa gayi or swasthya vibhaag main unhen naukari mil gai
 Somehow the train of life started moving forward
 mujhe bhi padhai ke liye skool bheja gaya lekin meraa khilne main zyada man lagata tha
 In our society, girls have a tradition of mastering household chores, girls playing are rarely seen
 logon ne manaa bhi kiya lekin main kahaan maanane vaali thi
 My mother also did not interrupt me and didi Lakshmi like my mother used to stand behind me like a wall
 maine footbal, wollyboul or hockey kheli
 When the boy came out with a stick to play hockey, where are the boys from the neighborhood
 ve meri khilli udaate the
 They used to say, look, you are going to play as a queen of Jhansi, carrying a big eye stick
 main vaise to ladakon kii parvaah bhi nahin karti thi, lekin jab baat akharane vaali lagati thi to main ghurkar unki taraf dekhati thi, to ve udan-chhu ho jate the
 i remember that once i would be 14 years old and both our sisters were going somewhere by bicycle, then Lakshmi didi stopped at one place and started talking to someone and i went ahead and waited for her there
 us dauraan kuch ladke cycle se udhar se gujarey to mujhase rasta chhodane ko kaha
 i refused and said that there is a place ahead, get out of there
 ve apni baat par ade rahe or main apni baat par
 Meanwhile, when Lakshmi didi came and we started walking, a boy slapped me, which hit my sister's cheek
 bheed kaa laabh uthaakar ladke bhaag gaye
 i was very angry to see the sister on the cheek
 maine didi se kaha ki chalo us ladke ko dhundhakar sabak sikhaate hai
 Sister refused but Chandi was riding on me
 ham donon un ladakon ko kaaphi der tak talashte rahe or gum-phir kar usee jagah aa gaye
 Seeing the collar of a boy's shirt standing at the paan shop there, Didi said that this is the boy
 bas phir kya tha, maine daudkar us ladke ko daboch liya or didi se kaha, "maar didi, chhodana nahin
 " bheed lag gai, kaaphi bavaal hua lekin maine choda nahin
 Finally, the boy's housemates came and apologized and then i left him
 uske baad phir kisi ne meri taraf yaa meri didi kii taraf najar uthaakar bhi nahin dekha
 Laxmi Didi got married but she has so much love towards me that she lives in the maternal house more than her in-laws and always lives to help me and my mother-brother
 mere jija om prakaash ji bhi hamaare liye devtaa kii tarah hai

 maine aas-paas ke jilon main wollyboul-footbal khelaa, kai puraskaar jite, lekin meraa junun badhata hi gaya
 i also participated in sports at the national level but i did not get my rights
 mere paas haath-pair the, junun tha lekin koi seedhi nahin thi, koi chat nahin thi jo mujhe aage badhane detii, mujhe mahfuj rakhti
 i thought that i should work somewhere so that i could move forward with that
 kai jagah farm daale
 Also tried in CISF and one day got out of the house to go to Noida's CISF office, alone
 vah din tha 11 april 2011 kaa
 i did not know that my world was going to change
 padmavati express train ke chaalu dibbe main khidki ke kinare ek seat par baithi raat ke andhere main jugnu jaisi kisi roshni kii talash kar rahi thi ki tabhi kuch 'lophar tip' ke ladke aae or unhone mere gale main padi chen par jhapatta maaraa
 i laughed
 in ladakon kii kya aukaat ki mujhase meri cheez chin len? maine ladke kaa haath pakadakar marod diya
 But when the other boy put his hand in my neck, then after removing my neck, the collar of my shirt came in place of the chain in his hand
 usne kaaler pakadakar ghasita or do-teen ladakon ne mujhe pakadakar daravaaje ke paas khinch liya
 It was not a difficult task for me to deal with them, but then the boys kicked at me such that i was seen rolling out of the moving train among the ballots
 
 
 pataa nahin kya hua, mujhe kuch pataa nahin ki mere pair ke upar se train ke kitne pahie guzarate chale gaye
 Were they the wheels of the Padmavat Express or the trains passing over the other tracks? At that time it was half past one and the train was near Bareilly
 lekin kuch sochane-samajhane se pehle dard ke aaveg ne mujhe besudh kar diya
 When i would break my sleep in between, i would see that i was lying on the side of the train tracks, i had a leg cut off, just some meat had kept it attached to my body
 bagal kii patari se rah-rahakar trainen guzar rahi thim
 The distance between the track and me was only a few inches
 main apane ko patari se dur karnaa chaahati thi lekin mere paas itnaa dam kahaan tha, us par bheeshan dard
 i lay in that rugged night the same way
 jab mujhe hosh aata to bajrangbali ko yaad karke yahi kahati ki jai bajrangbali
 
 yah kya ho rahaa he meri jindagi ke saath
 
 or ab kya shesh rah gaya he hone ko? ankhon ke saamne kabhi maa kii tasviir aati to kabhi bhai to kabhi lakshmi didi kii to kabhi jija kii
 
 
 i found myself lying when the people came towards the railway tracks for toilet
 gaanv vaale aae
 Asked my name and address
 shaayad aadhi behoshee main maine ghar kaa telephone number bataa diya tha
 The brother-in-law asked him to do so much help and reach Arunima to a hospital
 subah ke saat baje ke kareeb mujhe aspataal panhuchaya gaya
 My left leg was cut off
 media dwaara shor machaane par mujhe lakhanu ke troma centre main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 From there i was again taken to AIIMS
 doctoron ne mujhe bachaa liya
 CISF announced the hiring
 tatkaaleen rail mantri mamata banerjee ne bhi naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Sports Minister Ajay Maken gave considerable relief
 samaaj ko ye baaten hajam nahin huin
 With treatment, controversy also started that i am not a national level player
 maine inter bhi paas nahin kiya he
 i was running away with someone
 meri shaadi ho chuki he
 i did not participate in any competition
 main juthi hum, farebi hum
 UP ADG Rail AK Jain has proved me a liar by doing a press conference and said that i had attempted suicide by jumping from the train or i was crossing the railway line at midnight alone in that rugged desert area when this accident Decreased
 maine gusse main eke jain ko phone lagaakar khub sunaaya ki kya aapkaa koi sipaahi train main maujuud tha jo bataata ki us din train main mujhe luutane kii koshish nahin kii gai thi? kya raatbhar patariyon par pade hone ke baavjood jiarapy ne meri koi madad kii? man karata tha ki main eke jain ke paas jaakar unka munh noch luun
 My mother, my sister and brother-in-law at AIIMS explained to me what else does not happen to girls, people add acid, you have only got one leg, now plan ahead
 bahan kii prerana ne mere man main yah baat laa di ki kuch aisa karun jise duniya dekhe
 Why don't i climb Everest? i thought the best idea was to climb Everest without a foot
 asli chunauti yahi he
 Everyone does an easy job
 meri mushkil ko aasaan kar diya america nivasee dow rakesh shrivastav or unke bhai shailesh shrivastav ne jo innovative naam se ek sanstha chalaate hai
 They made a prosthetic leg for me which i wear
 mujhe ajay maakan ne itani sahuliyatein deen or vah bhi tab, jab uttar pradesh kii sarkaar mujhe mulgim bataane ke liye utaaru thi or media mere peeche pad gaya tha
 Players' organization 'sai' did not even consider me as a player
 main cheekh-cheekh kar kaha karti thi ki "main jinda hum, mujhase aakar pucho, main juthi nahin hum
 " lekin museebaton or parikshaon kaa ant abhi nahin hua tha
 My infamy was following me when i returned after spending four months in AIIMS
 mujhe viklaangata kaa pramaan patr mil gaya tha or rail se paas bhi
 But i did not get a ticket to run in the reserved coach of the second class of the train
 mujhe daudaya jaataa, shaq kiya jaataa
 For me, walking in a disabled bogey was like drinking bitter sips of insult
 arpeef ke sipaahi meri taang khulwakar dekhte or phir paas mangakar uski jaanch karte
 Once in Haridwar, the station master helped me a lot when i did not get a ticket
 unhone counter clerk se tikat dene ko kaha lekin usne kaha ki use mere paas par use shaq he
 It does not contain signatures
 ant main stesan master ne apane dam par mujhe jabardastee train main baithaaya
 Mamta Banerjee had announced the job
 jab main kritrim taangon se chalakar rail mantralay panhuchi to unke pie ne milaane se manaa kar diya
 Disappointed thrice, i returned
 railway board ke adhyaksh vivek sahay se milane main main kisi tarah kaamyaab ho gai to unka jawaab sunakar hairat hui
 He looked at all the papers and then said that first get a good report from the GRP
 ye thi railway ke mantri or adhyaksh kii maanviyata
 i did not lose courage
 kaha ki in sabko apni takat dikhaaungi, ye sab mujhe pahachaanenge or khud chalakar mere paas aaenge
 Bachendri Pal encouraged me a lot
 unheen ke prashikshan kii badaulat main aaj aasmaan ke itane kareeb hum
 i am on the peak of Mount Everest where not everyone can reach
 aisa lagata he ki bas haath uthaaun or chhu luun
 The comments mujhe bukhaar aa gaya
 And i had to return down to the world that did not want me to reach here
 lekin kuch log the jinka mere par vishwaas tha or unheen ke bharose main yahaan tak pahunchi hum
 My desire is to help people like myself with disabilities whom the society rejects
 main chaahati hum ki unke liye koi khel academy banaaun, unnav main saadhe saat bigha jameen mil gai he
 Have to buy three and a half bighas
 is academy se jab meri jaisi oonchi chahat rakhane vaale niklenge tab mujhe lagegaa ki mere saath jo kuch hua vah sab thik tha kyonki agar ye sab na hota to aane vaali peedi ko hausala koun de paata
 
 ! agle maheene kii 10 taarikh ko main 27 varsh kii ho jaaoongi
 i still have the courage to touch many heights
 bas, mujhe koi chunauti de dijie
 
 !" "I am on the sky of success, above Everest
 main jo chaahati thi vah maine paaya he
 My legs also fully supported me
 kya hua jo mere paas meraa apana baayan pair nahin he
 
 paraye pair ne paraepan kaa ahsaas tak nahin hone diya
 
 ek pair kya, mere paas or bhi kuch na hota tab bhi main yaheen par hoti
 Height calls to me, no one can touch my lofty intentions, no one can stop me
 main wollyboul-footbal khelnaa chaahati thi, hockey champion bananaa chaahati thi, lekin meri kati hui taang ne mujhe niyam-kanoon se bandhe khelon main jane se roak diya
 People say that laws are like shackles tied in feet, i did not even have a foot, but who could stop me from climbing the mountain
 jab maine pehali baar everest fatah karne kii apane dil kii ichha jataai thi to logon ne kaisaa majaak udaaya tha
 Today only those people can see where i am
 
 Hey, if you would have got the floor by walking on your feet, then billions of people would have reached their floors, it is encouraging that you can reach anywhere
 jaise main aaj yahaan par hum shwet barf se dhaki pahadiyon or svachh nile akaash ke neeche, jai bajrangbali
 
 ! My name is Arunima Sinha
 mujhe log sonu bhi kehete hai
 i am not very famous but the incident that happened to me two years ago gave me recognition
 vah pahchaan koi nekanami vaali nahin thi or na hi maine koi acha kaam kiya tha
 She was slanderous
 magar meri kya galati thi? i belong to the Kshetrana (shajadpur) locality of Ambedkarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh
 sach to yah he ki ham log mulat: bihar ke hai
 Father was in the army and we had come to Sultanpur
 lekin jab main chaar saal kii thi, tabhi mere pitaaji kaa swargvaas ho gaya
 i have a younger brother and older sister Lakshmi
 aap samaj sakate hai ki bina pita ke parivaar kii kya haalat hoti he
 My mother came to Ambedkaranagar and got a job in the health department
 kisi tarah jivan kii gaadi aage badhane lagi
 i too was sent to school to study but i used to feel more like playing
 hamaare samaaj main ladakiyon ko ghar ke kaam main nipun karne kii parampara he, khilne vaali ladkiyaan kam hi dikhaai padati hai
 People also refused but where was i going to believe
 meri maa bhi mujhe nahin tokati thi or meri maa jaisi didi lakshmi to jaise mere peeche diwaar banakar khadi rahati thim
 i played football, volleyball and hockey
 hockey khilne ke liye stick lekar jab nikalati thi to mohalle ke ladke kahaan baj aane vaale
 They used to ridicule me
 kehete the, dekho ja rahi he jhaansi kii rani banakar khilne, badi ai stick lekar chalane vaali
 Although i did not even care for the boys, but when i looked at the news, i used to stare and look at them, then they would fly away
 mujhe yaad he ki ek baar jab main 14 baras kii rahi houngi or cycle se ham donon bahanen kahin ja rahe the to ek jagah par lakshmi didi rukkar kisi se baat karne lageen or main thodaa aage nikalakar vahaan par unka intjaar karne lagi
 During that time some boys passed through the bicycle and asked me to leave the way
 maine manaa kar diya or kaha ki aage jagah he, udhar se nikal jaao
 He was adamant and i kept on my point
 is bich jab lakshmi didi aa gayi or ham chalane lage to kisi ladke ne jhapad maaraa jo meri didi ke gaal par lag gaya
 Taking advantage of the crowd, the boys ran away
 didi ke gaal par chaanta dekhakar mujhe bahut krodh aayaa
 i told Didi that let's find the boy and teach him a lesson
 didi ne manaa kiya lekin mere upar to jaise chandi savaar thi
 Both of us kept searching for those boys for a long time and wandered and came to the same place
 vahaan par paan kii dukaan par khadey ek ladke kii shart kaa kaaler dekhakar didi ne kaha ki yahi vah ladkaa he
 What was it again, i ran over and grabbed the boy and said to Didi, "mara didi, don't leave
 " There was a crowd, quite a ruckus but i did not leave
 ant main us ladke ke ghar vaale aae or maafee maangi tab jaakar maine use choda
 After that, no one looked at me or towards my sister
 lakshmi didi kii shaadi ho gai lekin mere prati unka itnaa pyaar rahata he ki vah sasuraal se zyada maayke main hi rahati hai or meri or meri maa-bhai kii madad karne ke liye hameshaa jaan die rahati hai
 My brother-in-law Om Prakash ji is like a god to us
 bajrangbali ne unhen jaise hamaare liye hi banaaya tha
 His shadow has helped me fulfill my dream
 maine inter kiya, elelbi kiya lekin khelnaa mere liye junun ke samaan hi tha
 i played volleyball-football in the surrounding districts, won many awards, but my passion kept growing
 maine rashtriya str par bhi khelon main bhaag liya lekin mujhe meraa haq nahin mila
 i had hands and feet, passion but no ladder, no roof that would let me move forward, keep me safe
 maine sochaa ki kahin par naukari kar luun taaki usee ke saath aage badhati jaaun
 Put forms in many places
 siaisef main bhi koshish kii or ek din noida main siaisef ke daftar main jane ke liye ghar se nikal padi, akeli
 The day was 11 April 2011
 mujhe nahin maaloom tha ki meri duniya badalane ja rahi he
 Sitting on a seat by the side of the window in the running compartment of the Padmavati Express train, in the dark of night, looking for a light like firefly that some 'loafer type' boys came and they swooped on the chain lying around my neck
 mujhe hansi aa gai
 What is the point of these boys taking away my thing from me? i held the boy's hand and jerked it
 lekin tabhi duusare ladke ne mere gale main haath daalaa to mere gardan hataa lene par uske haath main chen kii jagah meri shart kaa kaaler aa gaya
 He dragged him by holding the collar and two-three boys caught me and pulled him near the door
 mere liye unase nibatna mushkil kaam nahin tha lekin tabhi ladakon ne mere upar aisi laat maari ki main chalati train se baahar gittiyon ke bich lotati si najar ai
 
 
 i do not know what happened, i do not know how many wheels of the train passed over my foot
 ve pahie padmavat express ke the yaa duusari patari ke upar se guzarane vaali trainon ke? us samay raat ke dedh baje the or train bareli ke paas thi
 But the impulse of pain made me unaware before thinking anything
 bich-bich main meri tandra tuutati to dekhati ki main train kii patariyon ke kinare padi hum, meri ek taang cat gai thi bas kuch maance bhar ne use mere sharir se jode rakhaa tha
 Trains were passing by side by side
 patari or mere bich maatr kuch inchon kaa hi faasla tha
 i wanted to derail myself, but where did i have so much pain, a terrible pain
 main us behad raat main usee tarah padi rahi
 When i was conscious, i would remember Bajrangbali and say that Jai Bajrangbali
 
 What is happening with my life? 
 And what is left to happen now? Sometimes a picture of a mother came in front of her eyes, sometimes brother, sometimes Lakshmi didi and sometimes brother-in-law
 
 
 pau fatne par jab log shouch ke liye railway kii patariyon kii taraf aae to mujhe padaa paaya
 The villagers came
 meraa naam-pataa poocha
 Perhaps in the faint sense i had told the telephone number of the house
 jija ne unase kaha ki itani madad or kar dijie ki arunima ko kisi aspataal tak panhucha dijie
 i was taken to the hospital around 7 am
 meri bain taang kaat di gai
 i was admitted to the trauma center in Lucknow after the media made noise
 vahaan se phir mujhe ames le jaaya gaya
 The doctors saved me
 siaiesaf ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Railway Minister Mamta Banerjee also announced the job
 tatkaaleen khel mantri ajay maakan ne kaaphi raahaten deen
 The society did not digest these things
 ilaaj ke saath hi vivaad bhi shuru ho gaya ki main rashtriya str kii khilaadi nahin hum
 i have not even passed Inter
 main kisi ke saath bhaag rahi thi
 i am married
 maine kisi pratiyogita main bhaag nahin liya
 i am a liar, a fraud
 upi ke ediji rail eke jain ne to baqayada press conference karke mujhe jhootha sabit kiya or kaha ki maine train se kudakar aatmahatya kii koshish kii thi yaa phir main us behad sunsaan ilaake main akele aadhi raat ko railway line paar kar rahi thi, jab yah durghatana ghati
 i angrily telephoned AK Jain and told him that were any of your soldiers present in the train who would tell that there was no attempt to rob me in the train that day? Did GRP help me despite being on the tracks overnight? i used to think that i should go to AK Jain and face him
 ames main meri maa, meri bahan or jija ne mujhe samajhaayaa ki or ladakiyon ke saath kya-kya nahin hota, log tejaab tak daal dete hai, tumhaara to bas ek pair hi gaya he, ab aage kii yojana banaao
 Sister's inspiration brought to my mind that i should do something that the world sees
 kyon na everest par chadh jaaun? bina pair ke everest par chadhana hi mujhe sabase behatar vichaar laga
 This is the real challenge
 aasaan kaam to har koi kar letaa he
 Made my problem easy by the US resident Dr
 Rakesh Srivastava and his brother Shailesh Srivastava who run an organization called Innovative
 unhone mere liye ek kritrim pair banwaaya jisko pahanakar main chalati hum
 Ajay Maken gave me so much convenience and that too when the government of Uttar Pradesh took off to tell me the culprit and the media followed me
 khilaadiyon kaa sanghathan 'sai' bhi mujhe khilaadi nahin maanata tha
 i used to scream and say, "I am alive, come and ask me, i am not a liar
" " But the troubles and ordeals were not yet over
 chaar maheene ames main gujaarne ke baad jab main waapas lauti to meri badanaami meraa peechha kar rahi thi
 i got a certificate of disability and also a pass by rail
 lekin mujhe train ke senkad class kii arakshit bogi main chalane ke liye tikat nahin miltaa tha
 i was run, suspected
 mere liye viklang bogi main chalanaa bhi apmaan ke kadave ghunt pine ke samaan hi tha
 RPF soldiers would see my leg openly and then ask for a pass and check it
 ek baar to haridwar main jab mujhe tikat nahin mila to stesan master ne bahut madad kii
 He asked the counter clerk to give him the ticket but he said that he suspected me of it
 usamen hastakshar thik nahin hai
 In the end, the station master forced me to board the train on my own
 mamata banerjee ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 When i reached the Ministry of Railways through artificial legs, their PA refused to join
 teen baar niraash hokar main laut ai
 When i somehow managed to meet Railway Board Chairman Vivek Sahai, i was surprised to hear his answer
 unhone saare kagajaat dekhe or phir kaha ki pehle jiarapy se badhiya si report lagavakar lao
 This was the humanism of the railway minister and chairman
 maine himmat nahin haari
 Said that i will show my strength to all of them, they will all recognize me and come to me on their own
 mujhe bachhendri paal ne kaaphi protsaahit kiya
 Due to his training, i am so close to the sky today
 main mount everest kii chotii par hum jahaan par har koi nahin panhuch paata he
 It seems that just raise my hand and touch it
 tippaniyan i have a fever
 or neeche bhi lautnaa tha us duniya main jo nahin chaahati thi ki main yahaan tak pahunchun
 But there were some people who believed in me and i have reached here only because of them
 meri ichha apane jaise viklang logon kii madad karne kii he, jinhen samaaj thukraata he
 i want to build a sports academy for him, seven and a half bighas of land have been found in Unnao
 saadhe teen bigha or kharidni he
 When those who have high desires like me will come out of this academy, then i will feel that everything that happened to me was fine because if it had not happened then who would have been able to give encouragement to the next generation
 
 ! i will turn 27 on the 10th of next month
 mujhamen abhi bahut si oonchaaiyon ko chune kaa hausala baaki he
 Just challenge me

 khilaadiyon kaa sanghathan 'sai' bhi mujhe khilaadi nahin maanata tha
 i used to scream and say, "I am alive, come and ask me, i am not a liar
" " But the troubles and ordeals were not yet over
 chaar maheene ames main gujaarne ke baad jab main waapas lauti to meri badanaami meraa peechha kar rahi thi
 i got a certificate of disability and also a pass by rail
 lekin mujhe train ke senkad class kii arakshit bogi main chalane ke liye tikat nahin miltaa tha
 i was run, suspected
 mere liye viklang bogi main chalanaa bhi apmaan ke kadave ghunt pine ke samaan hi tha
 RPF soldiers would see my leg openly and then ask for a pass and check it
 ek baar to haridwar main jab mujhe tikat nahin mila to stesan master ne bahut madad kii
 He asked the counter clerk to give him the ticket but he said that he suspected me of it
 usamen hastakshar thik nahin hai
 In the end, the station master forced me to board the train on my own
 mamata banerjee ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 When i reached the Ministry of Railways through artificial legs, their PA refused to join
 teen baar niraash hokar main laut ai
 When i somehow managed to meet Railway Board Chairman Vivek Sahai, i was surprised to hear his answer
 unhone saare kagajaat dekhe or phir kaha ki pehle jiarapy se badhiya si report lagavakar lao
 This was the humanism of the railway minister and chairman
 maine himmat nahin haari
 Said that i will show my strength to all of them, they will all recognize me and come to me on their own
 mujhe bachhendri paal ne kaaphi protsaahit kiya
 Due to his training, i am so close to the sky today
 main mount everest kii chotii par hum jahaan par har koi nahin panhuch paata he
 It seems that just raise my hand and touch it
 tippaniyan i have a fever
 or neeche bhi lautnaa tha us duniya main jo nahin chaahati thi ki main yahaan tak pahunchun
 But there were some people who believed in me and i have reached here only because of them
 meri ichha apane jaise viklang logon kii madad karne kii he, jinhen samaaj thukraata he
 i want to build a sports academy for him, seven and a half bighas of land have been found in Unnao
 saadhe teen bigha or kharidni he
 When those who have high desires like me will come out of this academy, then i will feel that everything that happened to me was fine because if it had not happened then who would have been able to give encouragement to the next generation
 
 ! i will turn 27 on the 10th of next month
 mujhamen abhi bahut si oonchaaiyon ko chune kaa hausala baaki he
 Just challenge me
 
 ! " jab maine pehali baar everest fatah karne kii apane dil kii ichha jataai thi to logon ne kaisaa majaak udaaya tha
 Today only those people can see where i am
 
 Hey, if you would have got the floor by walking on your feet, then billions of people would have reached their floors, it is encouraging that you can reach anywhere
 jaise main aaj yahaan par hum shwet barf se dhaki pahadiyon or svachh nile akaash ke neeche, jai bajrangbali
 
 ! My name is Arunima Sinha
 mujhe log sonu bhi kehete hai
 i am not very famous but the incident that happened to me two years ago gave me recognition
 vah pahchaan koi nekanami vaali nahin thi or na hi maine koi acha kaam kiya tha
 She was slanderous
 magar meri kya galati thi? i belong to the Kshetrana (shajadpur) locality of Ambedkarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh
 sach to yah he ki ham log mulat: bihar ke hai
 Father was in the army and we had come to Sultanpur
 lekin jab main chaar saal kii thi, tabhi mere pitaaji kaa swargvaas ho gaya
 i have a younger brother and older sister Lakshmi
 aap samaj sakate hai ki bina pita ke parivaar kii kya haalat hoti he
 My mother came to Ambedkaranagar and got a job in the health department
 kisi tarah jivan kii gaadi aage badhane lagi
 i too was sent to school to study but i used to feel more like playing
 hamaare samaaj main ladakiyon ko ghar ke kaam main nipun karne kii parampara he, khilne vaali ladkiyaan kam hi dikhaai padati hai
 People also refused but where was i going to believe
neither did my mother interrupt meri maa bhi mujhe nahin tokati thi or meri maa jaisi didi lakshmi to jaise mere peeche diwaar banakar khadi rahati thim
 i played football, volleyball and hockey
 hockey khilne ke liye stick lekar jab nikalati thi to mohalle ke ladke kahaan baj aane vaale
 They used to ridicule me
 kehete the, dekho ja rahi he jhaansi kii rani banakar khilne, badi ai stick lekar chalane vaali
 Although i did not even care for the boys, but when i looked at the news, i used to stare and look at them, then they would fly away
 mujhe yaad he ki ek baar jab main 14 baras kii rahi houngi or cycle se ham donon bahanen kahin ja rahe the to ek jagah par lakshmi didi rukkar kisi se baat karne lageen or main thodaa aage nikalakar vahaan par unka intjaar karne lagi
 During that time some boys passed through the bicycle and asked me to leave the way
 maine manaa kar diya or kaha ki aage jagah he, udhar se nikal jaao
 He was adamant and i kept on my point
 is bich jab lakshmi didi aa gayi or ham chalane lage to kisi ladke ne jhapad maaraa jo meri didi ke gaal par lag gaya
 Taking advantage of the crowd, the boys ran away
 didi ke gaal par chaanta dekhakar mujhe bahut krodh aayaa
 i told Didi that let's find the boy and teach him a lesson
 didi ne manaa kiya lekin mere upar to jaise chandi savaar thi
 Both of us kept searching for those boys for a long time and wandered and came to the same place
 vahaan par paan kii dukaan par khadey ek ladke kii shart kaa kaaler dekhakar didi ne kaha ki yahi vah ladkaa he
 What was it again, i ran over and grabbed the boy and said to Didi, "mara didi, don't leave
 " There was a crowd, quite a ruckus but i did not leave
 ant main us ladke ke ghar vaale aae or maafee maangi tab jaakar maine use choda
 After that, no one looked at me or towards my sister
 lakshmi didi kii shaadi ho gai lekin mere prati unka itnaa pyaar rahata he ki vah sasuraal se zyada maayke main hi rahati hai or meri or meri maa-bhai kii madad karne ke liye hameshaa jaan die rahati hai
 My brother-in-law Om Prakash ji is like a god to us
 bajrangbali ne unhen jaise hamaare liye hi banaaya tha
 His shadow has helped me fulfill my dream
 maine inter kiya, elelbi kiya lekin khelnaa mere liye junun ke samaan hi tha
 i played volleyball-football in the surrounding districts, won many awards, but my passion kept growing
 maine rashtriya str par bhi khelon main bhaag liya lekin mujhe meraa haq nahin mila
 i had hands and feet, passion but no ladder, no roof that would let me move forward, keep me safe
 maine sochaa ki kahin par naukari kar luun taaki usee ke saath aage badhati jaaun
 Put forms in many places
 siaisef main bhi koshish kii or ek din noida main siaisef ke daftar main jane ke liye ghar se nikal padi, akeli
 The day was 11 April 2011
 mujhe nahin maaloom tha ki meri duniya badalane ja rahi he
 Sitting on a seat by the side of the window in the running compartment of the Padmavati Express train, in the dark of night, looking for a light like firefly that some 'loafer type' boys came and they swooped on the chain lying around my neck
 mujhe hansi aa gai
 What is the point of these boys taking away my thing from me? i held the boy's hand and jerked it
 lekin tabhi duusare ladke ne mere gale main haath daalaa to mere gardan hataa lene par uske haath main chen kii jagah meri shart kaa kaaler aa gaya
 He dragged him by holding the collar and two-three boys caught me and pulled him near the door
 mere liye unase nibatna mushkil kaam nahin tha lekin tabhi ladakon ne mere upar aisi laat maari ki main chalati train se baahar gittiyon ke bich lotati si najar ai
 
 
 i do not know what happened, i do not know how many wheels of the train passed over my foot
 ve pahie padmavat express ke the yaa duusari patari ke upar se guzarane vaali trainon ke? us samay raat ke dedh baje the or train bareli ke paas thi
 But the impulse of pain made me unaware before thinking anything
 bich-bich main meri tandra tuutati to dekhati ki main train kii patariyon ke kinare padi hum, meri ek taang cat gai thi bas kuch maance bhar ne use mere sharir se jode rakhaa tha
 Trains were passing by side by side
 patari or mere bich maatr kuch inchon kaa hi faasla tha
 i wanted to derail myself, but where did i have so much pain, a terrible pain
 main us behad raat main usee tarah padi rahi
 When i was conscious, i would remember Bajrangbali and say that Jai Bajrangbali
 
 What is happening with my life? 
 And what is left to happen now? Sometimes a picture of a mother came in front of her eyes, sometimes brother, sometimes Lakshmi didi and sometimes brother-in-law
 
 
 pau fatne par jab log shouch ke liye railway kii patariyon kii taraf aae to mujhe padaa paaya
 The villagers came
 meraa naam-pataa poocha
 Perhaps in the faint sense i had told the telephone number of the house
 jija ne unase kaha ki itani madad or kar dijie ki arunima ko kisi aspataal tak panhucha dijie
 i was taken to the hospital around 7 am
 meri bain taang kaat di gai
 i was admitted to the trauma center in Lucknow after the media made noise
 vahaan se phir mujhe ames le jaaya gaya
 The doctors saved me
 siaiesaf ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Railway Minister Mamta Banerjee also announced the job
 tatkaaleen khel mantri ajay maakan ne kaaphi raahaten deen
 The society did not digest these things
 ilaaj ke saath hi vivaad bhi shuru ho gaya ki main rashtriya str kii khilaadi nahin hum
 i have not even passed Inter
 main kisi ke saath bhaag rahi thi
 i am married
 maine kisi pratiyogita main bhaag nahin liya
 i am a liar, a fraud
 upi ke ediji rail eke jain ne to baqayada press conference karke mujhe jhootha sabit kiya or kaha ki maine train se kudakar aatmahatya kii koshish kii thi yaa phir main us behad sunsaan ilaake main akele aadhi raat ko railway line paar kar rahi thi, jab yah durghatana ghati
 i angrily telephoned AK Jain and told him that were any of your soldiers present in the train who would tell that there was no attempt to rob me in the train that day? Did GRP help me despite being on the tracks overnight? i used to think that i should go to AK Jain and face him
 ames main meri maa, meri bahan or jija ne mujhe samajhaayaa ki or ladakiyon ke saath kya-kya nahin hota, log tejaab tak daal dete hai, tumhaara to bas ek pair hi gaya he, ab aage kii yojana banaao
 Sister's inspiration brought to my mind that i should do something that the world sees
 kyon na everest par chadh jaaun? bina pair ke everest par chadhana hi mujhe sabase behatar vichaar laga
 This is the real challenge
 aasaan kaam to har koi kar letaa he
 Made my problem easy by the US resident Dr
 Rakesh Srivastava and his brother Shailesh Srivastava who run an organization called Innovative
 unhone mere liye ek kritrim pair banwaaya jisko pahanakar main chalati hum
 Ajay Maken gave me so much convenience and that too when the government of Uttar Pradesh took off to tell me the culprit and the media followed me
 khilaadiyon kaa sanghathan 'sai' bhi mujhe khilaadi nahin maanata tha
 i used to scream and say, "I am alive, come and ask me, i am not a liar
" " But the troubles and ordeals were not yet over
 chaar maheene ames main gujaarne ke baad jab main waapas lauti to meri badanaami meraa peechha kar rahi thi
 i got a certificate of disability and also a pass by rail
 lekin mujhe train ke senkad class kii arakshit bogi main chalane ke liye tikat nahin miltaa tha
 i was run, suspected
 mere liye viklang bogi main chalanaa bhi apmaan ke kadave ghunt pine ke samaan hi tha
 RPF soldiers would see my leg openly and then ask for a pass and check it
 ek baar to haridwar main jab mujhe tikat nahin mila to stesan master ne bahut madad kii
 He asked the counter clerk to give him the ticket but he said that he suspected me of it
 usamen hastakshar thik nahin hai
 In the end, the station master forced me to board the train on my own
 mamata banerjee ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 When i reached the Ministry of Railways through artificial legs, their PA refused to join
 teen baar niraash hokar main laut ai
 When i somehow managed to meet Railway Board Chairman Vivek Sahai, i was surprised to hear his answer
 unhone saare kagajaat dekhe or phir kaha ki pehle jiarapy se badhiya si report lagavakar lao
 This was the humanism of the railway minister and chairman
 maine himmat nahin haari
 Said that i will show my strength to all of them, they will all recognize me and come to me on their own
 mujhe bachhendri paal ne kaaphi protsaahit kiya
 Due to his training, i am so close to the sky today
 main mount everest kii chotii par hum jahaan par har koi nahin panhuch paata he
 It seems that just raise my hand and touch it
 tippaniyan i have a fever
 or neeche bhi lautnaa tha us duniya main jo nahin chaahati thi ki main yahaan tak pahunchun
 But there were some people who believed in me and i have reached here only because of them
 meri ichha apane jaise viklang logon kii madad karne kii he, jinhen samaaj thukraata he
 i want to build a sports academy for him, seven and a half bighas of land have been found in Unnao
 saadhe teen bigha or kharidni he
 When those who have high desires like me will come out of this academy, then i will feel that everything that happened to me was fine because if it had not happened then who would have been able to give encouragement to the next generation
 
 ! i will turn 27 on the 10th of next month
 mujhamen abhi bahut si oonchaaiyon ko chune kaa hausala baaki he
 Just challenge me
 
 ! " naam meraa he arunima sinha
 i am also called Sonu
 main bahut prasiddh nahin hum lekin do saal pehle mere saath jo haadasa hua tha, usase mujhe pahchaan mili
 That identity was not of any good faith nor did i do any good
 vah badanaami thi
 But what was my fault? main uttar pradesh ke ambedkarnagar jile ke kshetrana (shajadpur) mohalle kii hum
 The truth is that we are originally from Bihar
 pita fouj main the or ham log sultanpur aa gaye the
 But when i was four years old, my father died
 meraa ek chota bhai he or badi bahan lakshmi
 You can understand what is the condition of a family without a father
 meri maa ambedkarnagar aa gayi or swasthya vibhaag main unhen naukari mil gai
 Somehow the train of life started moving forward
 mujhe bhi padhai ke liye skool bheja gaya lekin meraa khilne main zyada man lagata tha
 In our society, girls have a tradition of mastering household chores, girls playing are rarely seen
 logon ne manaa bhi kiya lekin main kahaan maanane vaali thi
 My mother also did not interrupt me and didi Lakshmi like my mother used to stand behind me like a wall
 maine footbal, wollyboul or hockey kheli
 When the boy came out with a stick to play hockey, where are the boys from the neighborhood
 ve meri khilli udaate the
 They used to say, look, you are going to play as a queen of Jhansi, carrying a big eye stick
 main vaise to ladakon kii parvaah bhi nahin karti thi, lekin jab baat akharane vaali lagati thi to main ghurkar unki taraf dekhati thi, to ve udan-chhu ho jate the
 i remember that once i would be 14 years old and both our sisters were going somewhere by bicycle, then Lakshmi didi stopped at one place and started talking to someone and i went ahead and waited for her there
 us dauraan kuch ladke cycle se udhar se gujarey to mujhase rasta chhodane ko kaha
 i refused and said that there is a place ahead, get out of there
 ve apni baat par ade rahe or main apni baat par
 Meanwhile, when Lakshmi didi came and we started walking, a boy slapped me, which hit my sister's cheek
 bheed kaa laabh uthaakar ladke bhaag gaye
 i was very angry to see the sister on the cheek
 maine didi se kaha ki chalo us ladke ko dhundhakar sabak sikhaate hai
 Sister refused but Chandi was riding on me
 ham donon un ladakon ko kaaphi der tak talashte rahe or gum-phir kar usee jagah aa gaye
 Seeing the collar of a boy's shirt standing at the paan shop there, Didi said that this is the boy
 bas phir kya tha, maine daudkar us ladke ko daboch liya or didi se kaha, "maar didi, chhodana nahin
 " bheed lag gai, kaaphi bavaal hua lekin maine choda nahin
 Finally, the boy's housemates came and apologized and then i left him
 uske baad phir kisi ne meri taraf yaa meri didi kii taraf najar uthaakar bhi nahin dekha
 Laxmi Didi got married but she has so much love towards me that she lives in the maternal house more than her in-laws and always lives to help me and my mother-brother
 mere jija om prakaash ji bhi hamaare liye devtaa kii tarah hai
 Bajrangbali made them just like us
 unheen kii chhatrachhaaya ne mujhe meraa sapana puraa karne main madad kii he
 i did inter, LLB but playing was the same as passion for me
 maine aas-paas ke jilon main wollyboul-footbal khelaa, kai puraskaar jite, lekin meraa junun badhata hi gaya
 i also participated in sports at the national level but i did not get my rights
 mere paas haath-pair the, junun tha lekin koi seedhi nahin thi, koi chat nahin thi jo mujhe aage badhane detii, mujhe mahfuj rakhti
 i thought that i should work somewhere so that i could move forward with that
 kai jagah farm daale
 Also tried in CISF and one day got out of the house to go to Noida's CISF office, alone
 vah din tha 11 april 2011 kaa
 i did not know that my world was going to change
 padmavati express train ke chaalu dibbe main khidki ke kinare ek seat par baithi raat ke andhere main jugnu jaisi kisi roshni kii talash kar rahi thi ki tabhi kuch 'lophar tip' ke ladke aae or unhone mere gale main padi chen par jhapatta maaraa
 i laughed
 in ladakon kii kya aukaat ki mujhase meri cheez chin len? maine ladke kaa haath pakadakar marod diya
 But when the other boy put his hand in my neck, then after removing my neck, the collar of my shirt came in place of the chain in his hand
 usne kaaler pakadakar ghasita or do-teen ladakon ne mujhe pakadakar daravaaje ke paas khinch liya
 It was not a difficult task for me to deal with them, but then the boys kicked at me such that i was seen rolling out of the moving train among the ballots
 
 
 pataa nahin kya hua, mujhe kuch pataa nahin ki mere pair ke upar se train ke kitne pahie guzarate chale gaye
 Were they the wheels of the Padmavat Express or the trains passing over the other tracks? At that time it was half past one and the train was near Bareilly
 lekin kuch sochane-samajhane se pehle dard ke aaveg ne mujhe besudh kar diya
 When i would break my sleep in between, i would see that i was lying on the side of the train tracks, i had a leg cut off, just some meat had kept it attached to my body
 bagal kii patari se rah-rahakar trainen guzar rahi thim
 The distance between the track and me was only a few inches
 main apane ko patari se dur karnaa chaahati thi lekin mere paas itnaa dam kahaan tha, us par bheeshan dard
 i lay in that rugged night the same way
 jab mujhe hosh aata to bajrangbali ko yaad karke yahi kahati ki jai bajrangbali
 
 yah kya ho rahaa he meri jindagi ke saath
 
 or ab kya shesh rah gaya he hone ko? ankhon ke saamne kabhi maa kii tasviir aati to kabhi bhai to kabhi lakshmi didi kii to kabhi jija kii
 
 
 i found myself lying when the people came towards the railway tracks for toilet
 gaanv vaale aae
 Asked my name and address
 shaayad aadhi behoshee main maine ghar kaa telephone number bataa diya tha
 The brother-in-law asked him to do so much help and reach Arunima to a hospital
 subah ke saat baje ke kareeb mujhe aspataal panhuchaya gaya
 My left leg was cut off
 media dwaara shor machaane par mujhe lakhanu ke troma centre main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 From there i was again taken to AIIMS
 doctoron ne mujhe bachaa liya
 CISF announced the hiring
 tatkaaleen rail mantri mamata banerjee ne bhi naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Sports Minister Ajay Maken gave considerable relief
 samaaj ko ye baaten hajam nahin huin
 With treatment, controversy also started that i am not a national level player
 maine inter bhi paas nahin kiya he
 i was running away with someone
 meri shaadi ho chuki he
 i did not participate in any competition
 main juthi hum, farebi hum
 UP ADG Rail AK Jain has proved me a liar by doing a press conference and said that i had attempted suicide by jumping from the train or i was crossing the railway line at midnight alone in that rugged desert area when this accident Decreased
 maine gusse main eke jain ko phone lagaakar khub sunaaya ki kya aapkaa koi sipaahi train main maujuud tha jo bataata ki us din train main mujhe luutane kii koshish nahin kii gai thi? kya raatbhar patariyon par pade hone ke baavjood jiarapy ne meri koi madad kii? man karata tha ki main eke jain ke paas jaakar unka munh noch luun
 My mother, my sister and brother-in-law at AIIMS explained to me what else does not happen to girls, people add acid, you have only got one leg, now plan ahead
 bahan kii prerana ne mere man main yah baat laa di ki kuch aisa karun jise duniya dekhe
 Why don't i climb Everest? i thought the best idea was to climb Everest without a foot
 asli chunauti yahi he
 Everyone does an easy job
 meri mushkil ko aasaan kar diya america nivasee dow rakesh shrivastav or unke bhai shailesh shrivastav ne jo innovative naam se ek sanstha chalaate hai
 They made a prosthetic leg for me which i wear
 mujhe ajay maakan ne itani sahuliyatein deen or vah bhi tab, jab uttar pradesh kii sarkaar mujhe mulgim bataane ke liye utaaru thi or media mere peeche pad gaya tha
 Players' organization 'sai' did not even consider me as a player
 main cheekh-cheekh kar kaha karti thi ki "main jinda hum, mujhase aakar pucho, main juthi nahin hum
 " lekin museebaton or parikshaon kaa ant abhi nahin hua tha
 My infamy was following me when i returned after spending four months in AIIMS
 mujhe viklaangata kaa pramaan patr mil gaya tha or rail se paas bhi
 But i did not get a ticket to run in the reserved coach of the second class of the train
 mujhe daudaya jaataa, shaq kiya jaataa
 For me, walking in a disabled bogey was like drinking bitter sips of insult
 arpeef ke sipaahi meri taang khulwakar dekhte or phir paas mangakar uski jaanch karte
 Once in Haridwar, the station master helped me a lot when i did not get a ticket
 unhone counter clerk se tikat dene ko kaha lekin usne kaha ki use mere paas par use shaq he
 It does not contain signatures
 ant main stesan master ne apane dam par mujhe jabardastee train main baithaaya
 Mamta Banerjee had announced the job
 jab main kritrim taangon se chalakar rail mantralay panhuchi to unke pie ne milaane se manaa kar diya
 Disappointed thrice, i returned
 railway board ke adhyaksh vivek sahay se milane main main kisi tarah kaamyaab ho gai to unka jawaab sunakar hairat hui
 He looked at all the papers and then said that first get a good report from the GRP
 ye thi railway ke mantri or adhyaksh kii maanviyata
 i did not lose courage
 kaha ki in sabko apni takat dikhaaungi, ye sab mujhe pahachaanenge or khud chalakar mere paas aaenge
 Bachendri Pal encouraged me a lot
 unheen ke prashikshan kii badaulat main aaj aasmaan ke itane kareeb hum
 i am on the peak of Mount Everest where not everyone can reach
 aisa lagata he ki bas haath uthaaun or chhu luun
 The comments mujhe bukhaar aa gaya
 And i had to return down to the world that did not want me to reach here
 lekin kuch log the jinka mere par vishwaas tha or unheen ke bharose main yahaan tak pahunchi hum
 My desire is to help people like myself with disabilities whom the society rejects
 main chaahati hum ki unke liye koi khel academy banaaun, unnav main saadhe saat bigha jameen mil gai he
 Have to buy three and a half bighas
 is academy se jab meri jaisi oonchi chahat rakhane vaale niklenge tab mujhe lagegaa ki mere saath jo kuch hua vah sab thik tha kyonki agar ye sab na hota to aane vaali peedi ko hausala koun de paata
 
 ! agle maheene kii 10 taarikh ko main 27 varsh kii ho jaaoongi
 i still have the courage to touch many heights
 bas, mujhe koi chunauti de dijie

 mujhe nahin maaloom tha ki meri duniya badalane ja rahi he
 Sitting on a seat by the side of the window in the running compartment of the Padmavati Express train, in the dark of night, looking for a light like firefly that some 'loafer type' boys came and they swooped on the chain lying around my neck
 mujhe hansi aa gai
 What is the point of these boys taking away my thing from me? i held the boy's hand and jerked it
 lekin tabhi duusare ladke ne mere gale main haath daalaa to mere gardan hataa lene par uske haath main chen kii jagah meri shart kaa kaaler aa gaya
 He dragged him by holding the collar and two-three boys caught me and pulled him near the door
 mere liye unase nibatna mushkil kaam nahin tha lekin tabhi ladakon ne mere upar aisi laat maari ki main chalati train se baahar gittiyon ke bich lotati si najar ai
 
 
 i do not know what happened, i do not know how many wheels of the train passed over my foot
 ve pahie padmavat express ke the yaa duusari patari ke upar se guzarane vaali trainon ke? us samay raat ke dedh baje the or train bareli ke paas thi
 But the impulse of pain made me unaware before thinking anything
 bich-bich main meri tandra tuutati to dekhati ki main train kii patariyon ke kinare padi hum, meri ek taang cat gai thi bas kuch maance bhar ne use mere sharir se jode rakhaa tha
 Trains were passing by side by side
 patari or mere bich maatr kuch inchon kaa hi faasla tha
 i wanted to derail myself, but where did i have so much pain, a terrible pain
 main us behad raat main usee tarah padi rahi
 When i was conscious, i would remember Bajrangbali and say that Jai Bajrangbali
 
 What is happening with my life? 
 And what is left to happen now? Sometimes a picture of a mother came in front of her eyes, sometimes brother, sometimes Lakshmi didi and sometimes brother-in-law
 
 
 pau fatne par jab log shouch ke liye railway kii patariyon kii taraf aae to mujhe padaa paaya
 The villagers came
 meraa naam-pataa poocha
 Perhaps in the faint sense i had told the telephone number of the house
 jija ne unase kaha ki itani madad or kar dijie ki arunima ko kisi aspataal tak panhucha dijie
 i was taken to the hospital around 7 am
 meri bain taang kaat di gai
 i was admitted to the trauma center in Lucknow after the media made noise
 vahaan se phir mujhe ames le jaaya gaya
 The doctors saved me
 siaiesaf ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Railway Minister Mamta Banerjee also announced the job
 tatkaaleen khel mantri ajay maakan ne kaaphi raahaten deen
 The society did not digest these things

 i angrily telephoned AK Jain and told him that were any of your soldiers present in the train who would tell that there was no attempt to rob me in the train that day? Did GRP help me despite being on the tracks overnight? i used to think that i should go to AK Jain and face him
 ames main meri maa, meri bahan or jija ne mujhe samajhaayaa ki or ladakiyon ke saath kya-kya nahin hota, log tejaab tak daal dete hai, tumhaara to bas ek pair hi gaya he, ab aage kii yojana banaao
 Sister's inspiration brought to my mind that i should do something that the world sees
 kyon na everest par chadh jaaun? bina pair ke everest par chadhana hi mujhe sabase behatar vichaar laga
 This is the real challenge
 aasaan kaam to har koi kar letaa he
 Made my problem easy by the US resident Dr
 Rakesh Srivastava and his brother Shailesh Srivastava who run an organization called Innovative
 unhone mere liye ek kritrim pair banwaaya jisko pahanakar main chalati hum
 Ajay Maken gave me so much convenience and that too when the government of Uttar Pradesh took off to tell me the culprit and the media followed me
 khilaadiyon kaa sanghathan 'sai' bhi mujhe khilaadi nahin maanata tha
 i used to scream and say, "I am alive, come and ask me, i am not a liar
" " But the troubles and ordeals were not yet over
 chaar maheene ames main gujaarne ke baad jab main waapas lauti to meri badanaami meraa peechha kar rahi thi
 i got a certificate of disability and also a pass by rail
 lekin mujhe train ke senkad class kii arakshit bogi main chalane ke liye tikat nahin miltaa tha
 i was run, suspected
 mere liye viklang bogi main chalanaa bhi apmaan ke kadave ghunt pine ke samaan hi tha
 RPF soldiers would see my leg openly and then ask for a pass and check it
 ek baar to haridwar main jab mujhe tikat nahin mila to stesan master ne bahut madad kii
 He asked the counter clerk to give him the ticket but he said that he suspected me of it

 In the end, the station master forced me to board the train on my own
 mamata banerjee ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 When i reached the Ministry of Railways through artificial legs, their PA refused to join

 When i somehow managed to meet Railway Board Chairman Vivek Sahai, i was surprised to hear his answer
 unhone saare kagajaat dekhe or phir kaha ki pehle jiarapy se badhiya si report lagavakar lao
 This was the humanism of the railway minister and chairman
 maine himmat nahin haari
 Said that i will show my strength to all of them, they will all recognize me and come to me on their own
 mujhe bachhendri paal ne kaaphi protsaahit kiya
 Due to his training, i am so close to the sky today

 It seems that just raise my hand and touch it
 tippaniyan i have a fever
 or neeche bhi lautnaa tha us duniya main jo nahin chaahati thi ki main yahaan tak pahunchun
 But there were some people who believed in me and i have reached here only because of them
 meri ichha apane jaise viklang logon kii madad karne kii he, jinhen samaaj thukraata he
 i want to build a sports academy for him, seven and a half bighas of land have been found in Unnao
 saadhe teen bigha or kharidni he
 When those who have high desires like me will come out of this academy, then i will feel that everything that happened to me was fine because if it had not happened then who would have been able to give encouragement to the next generation
 
 ! i will turn 27 on the 10th of next month
 mujhamen abhi bahut si oonchaaiyon ko chune kaa hausala baaki he
 Just challenge me
 
 ! " meri maa ambedkarnagar aa gayi or swasthya vibhaag main unhen naukari mil gai
 Somehow the train of life started moving forward
 mujhe bhi padhai ke liye skool bheja gaya lekin meraa khilne main zyada man lagata tha
 In our society, girls have a tradition of mastering household chores, girls playing are rarely seen
 logon ne manaa bhi kiya lekin main kahaan maanane vaali thi
 My mother also did not interrupt me and didi Lakshmi like my mother used to stand behind me like a wall
 maine footbal, wollyboul or hockey kheli
 When the boy came out with a stick to play hockey, where are the boys from the neighborhood
 ve meri khilli udaate the
 They used to say, look, you are going to play as a queen of Jhansi, carrying a big eye stick
 main vaise to ladakon kii parvaah bhi nahin karti thi, lekin jab baat akharane vaali lagati thi to main ghurkar unki taraf dekhati thi, to ve udan-chhu ho jate the
 i remember that once i would be 14 years old and both our sisters were going somewhere by bicycle, then Lakshmi didi stopped at one place and started talking to someone and i went ahead and waited for her there
 us dauraan kuch ladke cycle se udhar se gujarey to mujhase rasta chhodane ko kaha
 i refused and said that there is a place ahead, get out of there
 ve apni baat par ade rahe or main apni baat par
 Meanwhile, when Lakshmi didi came and we started walking, a boy slapped me, which hit my sister's cheek
 bheed kaa laabh uthaakar ladke bhaag gaye
 i was very angry to see the sister on the cheek
 maine didi se kaha ki chalo us ladke ko dhundhakar sabak sikhaate hai
 Sister refused but Chandi was riding on me
 ham donon un ladakon ko kaaphi der tak talashte rahe or gum-phir kar usee jagah aa gaye
 Seeing the collar of a boy's shirt standing at the paan shop there, Didi said that this is the boy
 bas phir kya tha, maine daudkar us ladke ko daboch liya or didi se kaha, "maar didi, chhodana nahin
 " bheed lag gai, kaaphi bavaal hua lekin maine choda nahin
 Finally, the boy's housemates came and apologized and then i left him
 uske baad phir kisi ne meri taraf yaa meri didi kii taraf najar uthaakar bhi nahin dekha
 Laxmi Didi got married but she has so much love towards me that she lives in the maternal house more than her in-laws and always lives to help me and my mother-brother
 mere jija om prakaash ji bhi hamaare liye devtaa kii tarah hai
 Bajrangbali made them just like us
 unheen kii chhatrachhaaya ne mujhe meraa sapana puraa karne main madad kii he
 i did inter, LLB but playing was the same as passion for me
 maine aas-paas ke jilon main wollyboul-footbal khelaa, kai puraskaar jite, lekin meraa junun badhata hi gaya
 i also participated in sports at the national level but i did not get my rights
 mere paas haath-pair the, junun tha lekin koi seedhi nahin thi, koi chat nahin thi jo mujhe aage badhane detii, mujhe mahfuj rakhti
 i thought that i should work somewhere so that i could move forward with that
 kai jagah farm daale
 Also tried in CISF and one day got out of the house to go to Noida's CISF office, alone
 vah din tha 11 april 2011 kaa
 i did not know that my world was going to change
 padmavati express train ke chaalu dibbe main khidki ke kinare ek seat par baithi raat ke andhere main jugnu jaisi kisi roshni kii talash kar rahi thi ki tabhi kuch 'lophar tip' ke ladke aae or unhone mere gale main padi chen par jhapatta maaraa
 i laughed
 in ladakon kii kya aukaat ki mujhase meri cheez chin len? maine ladke kaa haath pakadakar marod diya
 But when the other boy put his hand in my neck, then after removing my neck, the collar of my shirt came in place of the chain in his hand
 usne kaaler pakadakar ghasita or do-teen ladakon ne mujhe pakadakar daravaaje ke paas khinch liya
 It was not a difficult task for me to deal with them, but then the boys kicked at me such that i was seen rolling out of the moving train among the ballots
 
 
 pataa nahin kya hua, mujhe kuch pataa nahin ki mere pair ke upar se train ke kitne pahie guzarate chale gaye
 Were they the wheels of the Padmavat Express or the trains passing over the other tracks? At that time it was half past one and the train was near Bareilly
 lekin kuch sochane-samajhane se pehle dard ke aaveg ne mujhe besudh kar diya
 When i would break my sleep in between, i would see that i was lying on the side of the train tracks, i had a leg cut off, just some meat had kept it attached to my body
 bagal kii patari se rah-rahakar trainen guzar rahi thim
 The distance between the track and me was only a few inches
 main apane ko patari se dur karnaa chaahati thi lekin mere paas itnaa dam kahaan tha, us par bheeshan dard
 i lay in that rugged night the same way
 jab mujhe hosh aata to bajrangbali ko yaad karke yahi kahati ki jai bajrangbali
 
 yah kya ho rahaa he meri jindagi ke saath
 
 or ab kya shesh rah gaya he hone ko? ankhon ke saamne kabhi maa kii tasviir aati to kabhi bhai to kabhi lakshmi didi kii to kabhi jija kii
 
 
 i found myself lying when the people came towards the railway tracks for toilet
 gaanv vaale aae
 Asked my name and address
 shaayad aadhi behoshee main maine ghar kaa telephone number bataa diya tha
 The brother-in-law asked him to do so much help and reach Arunima to a hospital
 subah ke saat baje ke kareeb mujhe aspataal panhuchaya gaya
 My left leg was cut off
 media dwaara shor machaane par mujhe lakhanu ke troma centre main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 From there i was again taken to AIIMS
 doctoron ne mujhe bachaa liya
 CISF announced the hiring
 tatkaaleen rail mantri mamata banerjee ne bhi naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Sports Minister Ajay Maken gave considerable relief
 samaaj ko ye baaten hajam nahin huin
 With treatment, controversy also started that i am not a national level player
 maine inter bhi paas nahin kiya he
 i was running away with someone
 meri shaadi ho chuki he
 i did not participate in any competition
 main juthi hum, farebi hum
 UP ADG Rail AK Jain has proved me a liar by doing a press conference and said that i had attempted suicide by jumping from the train or i was crossing the railway line at midnight alone in that rugged desert area when this accident Decreased
 maine gusse main eke jain ko phone lagaakar khub sunaaya ki kya aapkaa koi sipaahi train main maujuud tha jo bataata ki us din train main mujhe luutane kii koshish nahin kii gai thi? kya raatbhar patariyon par pade hone ke baavjood jiarapy ne meri koi madad kii? man karata tha ki main eke jain ke paas jaakar unka munh noch luun
 My mother, my sister and brother-in-law at AIIMS explained to me what else does not happen to girls, people add acid, you have only got one leg, now plan ahead
 bahan kii prerana ne mere man main yah baat laa di ki kuch aisa karun jise duniya dekhe
 Why don't i climb Everest? i thought the best idea was to climb Everest without a foot
 asli chunauti yahi he
 Everyone does an easy job
 meri mushkil ko aasaan kar diya america nivasee dow rakesh shrivastav or unke bhai shailesh shrivastav ne jo innovative naam se ek sanstha chalaate hai
 They made a prosthetic leg for me which i wear
 mujhe ajay maakan ne itani sahuliyatein deen or vah bhi tab, jab uttar pradesh kii sarkaar mujhe mulgim bataane ke liye utaaru thi or media mere peeche pad gaya tha
 Players' organization 'sai' did not even consider me as a player
 main cheekh-cheekh kar kaha karti thi ki "main jinda hum, mujhase aakar pucho, main juthi nahin hum
 " lekin museebaton or parikshaon kaa ant abhi nahin hua tha
 My infamy was following me when i returned after spending four months in AIIMS
 mujhe viklaangata kaa pramaan patr mil gaya tha or rail se paas bhi
 But i did not get a ticket to run in the reserved coach of the second class of the train
 mujhe daudaya jaataa, shaq kiya jaataa
 For me, walking in a disabled bogey was like drinking bitter sips of insult
 arpeef ke sipaahi meri taang khulwakar dekhte or phir paas mangakar uski jaanch karte
 Once in Haridwar, the station master helped me a lot when i did not get a ticket
 unhone counter clerk se tikat dene ko kaha lekin usne kaha ki use mere paas par use shaq he
 It does not contain signatures
 ant main stesan master ne apane dam par mujhe jabardastee train main baithaaya
 Mamta Banerjee had announced the job
 jab main kritrim taangon se chalakar rail mantralay panhuchi to unke pie ne milaane se manaa kar diya
 Disappointed thrice, i returned
 railway board ke adhyaksh vivek sahay se milane main main kisi tarah kaamyaab ho gai to unka jawaab sunakar hairat hui
 He looked at all the papers and then said that first get a good report from the GRP
 ye thi railway ke mantri or adhyaksh kii maanviyata
 i did not lose courage
 kaha ki in sabko apni takat dikhaaungi, ye sab mujhe pahachaanenge or khud chalakar mere paas aaenge
 Bachendri Pal encouraged me a lot
 unheen ke prashikshan kii badaulat main aaj aasmaan ke itane kareeb hum
 i am on the peak of Mount Everest where not everyone can reach
 aisa lagata he ki bas haath uthaaun or chhu luun
 The comments mujhe bukhaar aa gaya
 And i had to return down to the world that did not want me to reach here
 lekin kuch log the jinka mere par vishwaas tha or unheen ke bharose main yahaan tak pahunchi hum
 My desire is to help people like myself with disabilities whom the society rejects
 main chaahati hum ki unke liye koi khel academy banaaun, unnav main saadhe saat bigha jameen mil gai he
 Have to buy three and a half bighas
 is academy se jab meri jaisi oonchi chahat rakhane vaale niklenge tab mujhe lagegaa ki mere saath jo kuch hua vah sab thik tha kyonki agar ye sab na hota to aane vaali peedi ko hausala koun de paata
 
 ! agle maheene kii 10 taarikh ko main 27 varsh kii ho jaaoongi
 i still have the courage to touch many heights
 bas, mujhe koi chunauti de dijie
 
 !" i played football, volleyball and hockey
 hockey khilne ke liye stick lekar jab nikalati thi to mohalle ke ladke kahaan baj aane vaale
 They used to ridicule me
 kehete the, dekho ja rahi he jhaansi kii rani banakar khilne, badi ai stick lekar chalane vaali
 Although i did not even care for the boys, but when i looked at the news, i used to stare and look at them, then they would fly away
 mujhe yaad he ki ek baar jab main 14 baras kii rahi houngi or cycle se ham donon bahanen kahin ja rahe the to ek jagah par lakshmi didi rukkar kisi se baat karne lageen or main thodaa aage nikalakar vahaan par unka intjaar karne lagi
 During that time some boys passed through the bicycle and asked me to leave the way
 maine manaa kar diya or kaha ki aage jagah he, udhar se nikal jaao
 He was adamant and i kept on my point
 is bich jab lakshmi didi aa gayi or ham chalane lage to kisi ladke ne jhapad maaraa jo meri didi ke gaal par lag gaya
 Taking advantage of the crowd, the boys ran away
 didi ke gaal par chaanta dekhakar mujhe bahut krodh aayaa
 i told Didi that let's find the boy and teach him a lesson
 didi ne manaa kiya lekin mere upar to jaise chandi savaar thi
 Both of us kept searching for those boys for a long time and wandered and came to the same place
 vahaan par paan kii dukaan par khadey ek ladke kii shart kaa kaaler dekhakar didi ne kaha ki yahi vah ladkaa he
 What was it again, i ran over and grabbed the boy and said to Didi, "mara didi, don't leave
 " There was a crowd, quite a ruckus but i did not leave
 ant main us ladke ke ghar vaale aae or maafee maangi tab jaakar maine use choda
 After that, no one looked at me or towards my sister
 lakshmi didi kii shaadi ho gai lekin mere prati unka itnaa pyaar rahata he ki vah sasuraal se zyada maayke main hi rahati hai or meri or meri maa-bhai kii madad karne ke liye hameshaa jaan die rahati hai
 My brother-in-law Om Prakash ji is like a god to us
 bajrangbali ne unhen jaise hamaare liye hi banaaya tha
 His shadow has helped me fulfill my dream
 maine inter kiya, elelbi kiya lekin khelnaa mere liye junun ke samaan hi tha
 i played volleyball-football in the surrounding districts, won many awards, but my passion kept growing
 maine rashtriya str par bhi khelon main bhaag liya lekin mujhe meraa haq nahin mila
 i had hands and feet, passion but no ladder, no roof that would let me move forward, keep me safe
 maine sochaa ki kahin par naukari kar luun taaki usee ke saath aage badhati jaaun
 Put forms in many places
 siaisef main bhi koshish kii or ek din noida main siaisef ke daftar main jane ke liye ghar se nikal padi, akeli

 maine rashtriya str par bhi khelon main bhaag liya lekin mujhe meraa haq nahin mila
 i had hands and feet, passion but no ladder, no roof that would let me move forward, keep me safe
 maine sochaa ki kahin par naukari kar luun taaki usee ke saath aage badhati jaaun
 Put forms in many places
 siaisef main bhi koshish kii or ek din noida main siaisef ke daftar main jane ke liye ghar se nikal padi, akeli
 The day was 11 April 2011
 mujhe nahin maaloom tha ki meri duniya badalane ja rahi he
 Sitting on a seat by the side of the window in the running compartment of the Padmavati Express train, in the dark of night, looking for a light like firefly that some 'loafer type' boys came and they swooped on the chain lying around my neck
 mujhe hansi aa gai
 What is the point of these boys taking away my thing from me? i held the boy's hand and jerked it
 lekin tabhi duusare ladke ne mere gale main haath daalaa to mere gardan hataa lene par uske haath main chen kii jagah meri shart kaa kaaler aa gaya
 He dragged him by holding the collar and two-three boys caught me and pulled him near the door
 mere liye unase nibatna mushkil kaam nahin tha lekin tabhi ladakon ne mere upar aisi laat maari ki main chalati train se baahar gittiyon ke bich lotati si najar ai
 
 
 i do not know what happened, i do not know how many wheels of the train passed over my foot
 ve pahie padmavat express ke the yaa duusari patari ke upar se guzarane vaali trainon ke? us samay raat ke dedh baje the or train bareli ke paas thi
 But the impulse of pain made me unaware before thinking anything
 bich-bich main meri tandra tuutati to dekhati ki main train kii patariyon ke kinare padi hum, meri ek taang cat gai thi bas kuch maance bhar ne use mere sharir se jode rakhaa tha
 Trains were passing by side by side
 patari or mere bich maatr kuch inchon kaa hi faasla tha
 i wanted to derail myself, but where did i have so much pain, a terrible pain
 main us behad raat main usee tarah padi rahi
 When i was conscious, i would remember Bajrangbali and say that Jai Bajrangbali
 
 What is happening with my life? 
 And what is left to happen now? Sometimes a picture of a mother came in front of her eyes, sometimes brother, sometimes Lakshmi didi and sometimes brother-in-law
 
 
 pau fatne par jab log shouch ke liye railway kii patariyon kii taraf aae to mujhe padaa paaya
 The villagers came
 meraa naam-pataa poocha
 Perhaps in the faint sense i had told the telephone number of the house
 jija ne unase kaha ki itani madad or kar dijie ki arunima ko kisi aspataal tak panhucha dijie
 i was taken to the hospital around 7 am
 meri bain taang kaat di gai
 i was admitted to the trauma center in Lucknow after the media made noise
 vahaan se phir mujhe ames le jaaya gaya
 The doctors saved me
 siaiesaf ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Railway Minister Mamta Banerjee also announced the job
 tatkaaleen khel mantri ajay maakan ne kaaphi raahaten deen
 The society did not digest these things
 ilaaj ke saath hi vivaad bhi shuru ho gaya ki main rashtriya str kii khilaadi nahin hum
 i have not even passed Inter
 main kisi ke saath bhaag rahi thi
 i am married
 maine kisi pratiyogita main bhaag nahin liya
 i am a liar, a fraud
 upi ke ediji rail eke jain ne to baqayada press conference karke mujhe jhootha sabit kiya or kaha ki maine train se kudakar aatmahatya kii koshish kii thi yaa phir main us behad sunsaan ilaake main akele aadhi raat ko railway line paar kar rahi thi, jab yah durghatana ghati
 i angrily telephoned AK Jain and told him that were any of your soldiers present in the train who would tell that there was no attempt to rob me in the train that day? Did GRP help me despite being on the tracks overnight? i used to think that i should go to AK Jain and face him
 ames main meri maa, meri bahan or jija ne mujhe samajhaayaa ki or ladakiyon ke saath kya-kya nahin hota, log tejaab tak daal dete hai, tumhaara to bas ek pair hi gaya he, ab aage kii yojana banaao
 Sister's inspiration brought to my mind that i should do something that the world sees
 kyon na everest par chadh jaaun? bina pair ke everest par chadhana hi mujhe sabase behatar vichaar laga
 This is the real challenge
 aasaan kaam to har koi kar letaa he
 Made my problem easy by the US resident Dr
 Rakesh Srivastava and his brother Shailesh Srivastava who run an organization called Innovative
 unhone mere liye ek kritrim pair banwaaya jisko pahanakar main chalati hum
 Ajay Maken gave me so much convenience and that too when the government of Uttar Pradesh took off to tell me the culprit and the media followed me
 khilaadiyon kaa sanghathan 'sai' bhi mujhe khilaadi nahin maanata tha
 i used to scream and say, "I am alive, come and ask me, i am not a liar
" " But the troubles and ordeals were not yet over
 chaar maheene ames main gujaarne ke baad jab main waapas lauti to meri badanaami meraa peechha kar rahi thi
 i got a certificate of disability and also a pass by rail
 lekin mujhe train ke senkad class kii arakshit bogi main chalane ke liye tikat nahin miltaa tha
 i was run, suspected
 mere liye viklang bogi main chalanaa bhi apmaan ke kadave ghunt pine ke samaan hi tha
 RPF soldiers would see my leg openly and then ask for a pass and check it
 ek baar to haridwar main jab mujhe tikat nahin mila to stesan master ne bahut madad kii
 He asked the counter clerk to give him the ticket, but he said that he has doubts about me
 usamen hastakshar thik nahin hai
 In the end, the station master forced me to board the train on my own
 mamata banerjee ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 When i reached the Ministry of Railways through artificial legs, their PA refused to join
 teen baar niraash hokar main laut ai
 When i somehow managed to meet Railway Board Chairman Vivek Sahai, i was surprised to hear his answer
 unhone saare kagajaat dekhe or phir kaha ki pehle jiarapy se badhiya si report lagavakar lao
 This was the humanism of the railway minister and chairman
 maine himmat nahin haari
 Said that i will show my strength to all of them, they will all recognize me and come to me on their own
 mujhe bachhendri paal ne kaaphi protsaahit kiya
 Due to his training, i am so close to the sky today
 main mount everest kii chotii par hum jahaan par har koi nahin panhuch paata he
 It seems that just raise my hand and touch it
 tippaniyan i have a fever
 or neeche bhi lautnaa tha us duniya main jo nahin chaahati thi ki main yahaan tak pahunchun
 But there were some people who believed in me and i have reached here only because of them
 meri ichha apane jaise viklang logon kii madad karne kii he, jinhen samaaj thukraata he
 i want to build a sports academy for him, seven and a half bighas of land have been found in Unnao
 saadhe teen bigha or kharidni he
 When those who have high desires like me will come out of this academy, then i will feel that everything that happened to me was fine because if it had not happened then who would have been able to give encouragement to the next generation
 
 ! i will turn 27 on the 10th of next month
 mujhamen abhi bahut si oonchaaiyon ko chune kaa hausala baaki he
 Just challenge me
 
 ! " ve apni baat par ade rahe or main apni baat par
 Meanwhile, when Lakshmi didi came and we started walking, a boy slapped me, which hit my sister's cheek
 bheed kaa laabh uthaakar ladke bhaag gaye
 i was very angry to see the sister on the cheek
 maine didi se kaha ki chalo us ladke ko dhundhakar sabak sikhaate hai
 Sister refused but Chandi was riding on me
 ham donon un ladakon ko kaaphi der tak talashte rahe or gum-phir kar usee jagah aa gaye
 Seeing the collar of a boy's shirt standing at the paan shop there, Didi said that this is the boy
 bas phir kya tha, maine daudkar us ladke ko daboch liya or didi se kaha, "maar didi, chhodana nahin
 " bheed lag gai, kaaphi bavaal hua lekin maine choda nahin
 Finally, the boy's housemates came and apologized and then i left him
 uske baad phir kisi ne meri taraf yaa meri didi kii taraf najar uthaakar bhi nahin dekha
 Laxmi Didi got married but she has so much love towards me that she lives in the maternal house more than her in-laws and always lives to help me and my mother-brother
 mere jija om prakaash ji bhi hamaare liye devtaa kii tarah hai
 Bajrangbali made them just like us
 unheen kii chhatrachhaaya ne mujhe meraa sapana puraa karne main madad kii he
 i did inter, LLB but playing was the same as passion for me
 maine aas-paas ke jilon main wollyboul-footbal khelaa, kai puraskaar jite, lekin meraa junun badhata hi gaya
 i also participated in sports at the national level but i did not get my rights
 mere paas haath-pair the, junun tha lekin koi seedhi nahin thi, koi chat nahin thi jo mujhe aage badhane detii, mujhe mahfuj rakhti
 i thought that i should work somewhere so that i could move forward with that
 kai jagah farm daale
 Also tried in CISF and one day got out of the house to go to Noida's CISF office, alone
 vah din tha 11 april 2011 kaa
 i did not know that my world was going to change
 padmavati express train ke chaalu dibbe main khidki ke kinare ek seat par baithi raat ke andhere main jugnu jaisi kisi roshni kii talash kar rahi thi ki tabhi kuch 'lophar tip' ke ladke aae or unhone mere gale main padi chen par jhapatta maaraa
 i laughed
 in ladakon kii kya aukaat ki mujhase meri cheez chin len? maine ladke kaa haath pakadakar marod diya
 But when the other boy put his hand in my neck, then after removing my neck, the collar of my shirt came in place of the chain in his hand
 usne kaaler pakadakar ghasita or do-teen ladakon ne mujhe pakadakar daravaaje ke paas khinch liya
 It was not a difficult task for me to deal with them, but then the boys kicked at me such that i was seen rolling out of the moving train among the ballots
 
 
 pataa nahin kya hua, mujhe kuch pataa nahin ki mere pair ke upar se train ke kitne pahie guzarate chale gaye
 Were they the wheels of the Padmavat Express or the trains passing over the other tracks? At that time it was half past one and the train was near Bareilly
 lekin kuch sochane-samajhane se pehle dard ke aaveg ne mujhe besudh kar diya
 When i would break my sleep in between, i would see that i was lying on the side of the train tracks, i had a leg cut off, just some meat had kept it attached to my body
 bagal kii patari se rah-rahakar trainen guzar rahi thim
 The distance between the track and me was only a few inches
 main apane ko patari se dur karnaa chaahati thi lekin mere paas itnaa dam kahaan tha, us par bheeshan dard
 i lay in that rugged night the same way
 jab mujhe hosh aata to bajrangbali ko yaad karke yahi kahati ki jai bajrangbali
 
 yah kya ho rahaa he meri jindagi ke saath
 
 or ab kya shesh rah gaya he hone ko? ankhon ke saamne kabhi maa kii tasviir aati to kabhi bhai to kabhi lakshmi didi kii to kabhi jija kii
 
 
 i found myself lying when the people came towards the railway tracks for toilet
 gaanv vaale aae
 Asked my name and address
 shaayad aadhi behoshee main maine ghar kaa telephone number bataa diya tha
 The brother-in-law asked him to do so much help and reach Arunima to a hospital
 subah ke saat baje ke kareeb mujhe aspataal panhuchaya gaya
 My left leg was cut off
 media dwaara shor machaane par mujhe lakhanu ke troma centre main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 From there i was again taken to AIIMS
 doctoron ne mujhe bachaa liya
 CISF announced the hiring
 tatkaaleen rail mantri mamata banerjee ne bhi naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Sports Minister Ajay Maken gave considerable relief
 samaaj ko ye baaten hajam nahin huin
 With treatment, controversy also started that i am not a national level player
 maine inter bhi paas nahin kiya he
 i was running away with someone
 meri shaadi ho chuki he
 i did not participate in any competition
 main juthi hum, farebi hum
 UP ADG Rail AK Jain has proved me a liar by doing a press conference and said that i had attempted suicide by jumping from the train or i was crossing the railway line at midnight alone in that rugged desert area when this accident Decreased
 maine gusse main eke jain ko phone lagaakar khub sunaaya ki kya aapkaa koi sipaahi train main maujuud tha jo bataata ki us din train main mujhe luutane kii koshish nahin kii gai thi? kya raatbhar patariyon par pade hone ke baavjood jiarapy ne meri koi madad kii? man karata tha ki main eke jain ke paas jaakar unka munh noch luun
 My mother, my sister and brother-in-law at AIIMS explained to me what else does not happen to girls, people add acid, you have only got one leg, now plan ahead
 bahan kii prerana ne mere man main yah baat laa di ki kuch aisa karun jise duniya dekhe
 Why don't i climb Everest? i thought the best idea was to climb Everest without a foot
 asli chunauti yahi he
 Everyone does an easy job
 meri mushkil ko aasaan kar diya america nivasee dow rakesh shrivastav or unke bhai shailesh shrivastav ne jo innovative naam se ek sanstha chalaate hai
 They made a prosthetic leg for me which i wear
 mujhe ajay maakan ne itani sahuliyatein deen or vah bhi tab, jab uttar pradesh kii sarkaar mujhe mulgim bataane ke liye utaaru thi or media mere peeche pad gaya tha
 Players' organization 'sai' did not even consider me as a player
 main cheekh-cheekh kar kaha karti thi ki "main jinda hum, mujhase aakar pucho, main juthi nahin hum
 " lekin museebaton or parikshaon kaa ant abhi nahin hua tha
 My infamy was following me when i returned after spending four months in AIIMS
 mujhe viklaangata kaa pramaan patr mil gaya tha or rail se paas bhi
 But i did not get a ticket to run in the reserved coach of the second class of the train
 mujhe daudaya jaataa, shaq kiya jaataa
 For me, walking in a disabled bogey was like drinking bitter sips of insult
 arpeef ke sipaahi meri taang khulwakar dekhte or phir paas mangakar uski jaanch karte
 Once in Haridwar, the station master helped me a lot when i did not get a ticket
 unhone counter clerk se tikat dene ko kaha lekin usne kaha ki use mere paas par use shaq he
 It does not contain signatures
 ant main stesan master ne apane dam par mujhe jabardastee train main baithaaya
 Mamta Banerjee had announced the job
 jab main kritrim taangon se chalakar rail mantralay panhuchi to unke pie ne milaane se manaa kar diya
 Disappointed thrice, i returned
 railway board ke adhyaksh vivek sahay se milane main main kisi tarah kaamyaab ho gai to unka jawaab sunakar hairat hui
 He looked at all the papers and then said that first get a good report from the GRP
 ye thi railway ke mantri or adhyaksh kii maanviyata
 i did not lose courage
 kaha ki in sabko apni takat dikhaaungi, ye sab mujhe pahachaanenge or khud chalakar mere paas aaenge
 Bachendri Pal encouraged me a lot
 unheen ke prashikshan kii badaulat main aaj aasmaan ke itane kareeb hum
 i am on the peak of Mount Everest where not everyone can reach
 aisa lagata he ki bas haath uthaaun or chhu luun
 The comments mujhe bukhaar aa gaya
 And i had to return down to the world that did not want me to reach here
 lekin kuch log the jinka mere par vishwaas tha or unheen ke bharose main yahaan tak pahunchi hum
 My desire is to help people like myself with disabilities whom the society rejects
 main chaahati hum ki unke liye koi khel academy banaaun, unnav main saadhe saat bigha jameen mil gai he
 Have to buy three and a half bighas
 is academy se jab meri jaisi oonchi chahat rakhane vaale niklenge tab mujhe lagegaa ki mere saath jo kuch hua vah sab thik tha kyonki agar ye sab na hota to aane vaali peedi ko hausala koun de paata
 
 ! agle maheene kii 10 taarikh ko main 27 varsh kii ho jaaoongi
 i still have the courage to touch many heights
 bas, mujhe koi chunauti de dijie
 
 !" There was a crowd, quite a ruckus but i did not leave
 ant main us ladke ke ghar vaale aae or maafee maangi tab jaakar maine use choda
 After that, no one looked at me or towards my sister
 lakshmi didi kii shaadi ho gai lekin mere prati unka itnaa pyaar rahata he ki vah sasuraal se zyada maayke main hi rahati hai or meri or meri maa-bhai kii madad karne ke liye hameshaa jaan die rahati hai
 My brother-in-law Om Prakash ji is like a god to us
 bajrangbali ne unhen jaise hamaare liye hi banaaya tha
 His shadow has helped me fulfill my dream
 maine inter kiya, elelbi kiya lekin khelnaa mere liye junun ke samaan hi tha
 i played volleyball-football in the surrounding districts, won many awards, but my passion kept growing
 maine rashtriya str par bhi khelon main bhaag liya lekin mujhe meraa haq nahin mila
 i had hands and feet, passion but no ladder, no roof that would let me move forward, keep me safe

 Put forms in many places
 siaisef main bhi koshish kii or ek din noida main siaisef ke daftar main jane ke liye ghar se nikal padi, akeli
 The day was 11 April 2011
 mujhe nahin maaloom tha ki meri duniya badalane ja rahi he
 Sitting on a seat by the side of the window in the running compartment of the Padmavati Express train, in the dark of night, looking for a light like firefly that some 'loafer type' boys came and they swooped on the chain lying around my neck
 mujhe hansi aa gai
 What is the point of these boys taking away my thing from me? i held the boy's hand and jerked it
 lekin tabhi duusare ladke ne mere gale main haath daalaa to mere gardan hataa lene par uske haath main chen kii jagah meri shart kaa kaaler aa gaya
 He dragged him by holding the collar and two-three boys caught me and pulled him near the door
 mere liye unase nibatna mushkil kaam nahin tha lekin tabhi ladakon ne mere upar aisi laat maari ki main chalati train se baahar gittiyon ke bich lotati si najar ai
 
 
 i do not know what happened, i do not know how many wheels of the train passed over my foot
 ve pahie padmavat express ke the yaa duusari patari ke upar se guzarane vaali trainon ke? us samay raat ke dedh baje the or train bareli ke paas thi
 But the impulse of pain made me unaware before thinking anything
 bich-bich main meri tandra tuutati to dekhati ki main train kii patariyon ke kinare padi hum, meri ek taang cat gai thi bas kuch maance bhar ne use mere sharir se jode rakhaa tha
 Trains were passing by side by side
 patari or mere bich maatr kuch inchon kaa hi faasla tha
 i wanted to derail myself, but where did i have so much pain, a terrible pain
 main us behad raat main usee tarah padi rahi
 When i was conscious, i would remember Bajrangbali and say that Jai Bajrangbali
 
 What is happening with my life? 
 And what is left to happen now? Sometimes a picture of a mother came in front of her eyes, sometimes brother, sometimes Lakshmi didi and sometimes brother-in-law
 
 
 pau fatne par jab log shouch ke liye railway kii patariyon kii taraf aae to mujhe padaa paaya
 The villagers came
 meraa naam-pataa poocha
 Perhaps in the faint sense i had told the telephone number of the house
 jija ne unase kaha ki itani madad or kar dijie ki arunima ko kisi aspataal tak panhucha dijie
 i was taken to the hospital around 7 am
 meri bain taang kaat di gai
 i was admitted to the trauma center in Lucknow after the media made noise
 vahaan se phir mujhe ames le jaaya gaya
 The doctors saved me
 siaiesaf ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Railway Minister Mamta Banerjee also announced the job
 tatkaaleen khel mantri ajay maakan ne kaaphi raahaten deen
 The society did not digest these things
 ilaaj ke saath hi vivaad bhi shuru ho gaya ki main rashtriya str kii khilaadi nahin hum
 i have not even passed Inter
 main kisi ke saath bhaag rahi thi
 i am married
 maine kisi pratiyogita main bhaag nahin liya
 i am a liar, a fraud
 upi ke ediji rail eke jain ne to baqayada press conference karke mujhe jhootha sabit kiya or kaha ki maine train se kudakar aatmahatya kii koshish kii thi yaa phir main us behad sunsaan ilaake main akele aadhi raat ko railway line paar kar rahi thi, jab yah durghatana ghati

 i laughed
 in ladakon kii kya aukaat ki mujhase meri cheez chin len? maine ladke kaa haath pakadakar marod diya
 But when the other boy put his hand in my neck, then after removing my neck, the collar of my shirt came in place of the chain in his hand
 usne kaaler pakadakar ghasita or do-teen ladakon ne mujhe pakadakar daravaaje ke paas khinch liya
 It was not a difficult task for me to deal with them, but then the boys kicked at me such that i was seen rolling out of the moving train among the ballots
 
 
 pataa nahin kya hua, mujhe kuch pataa nahin ki mere pair ke upar se train ke kitne pahie guzarate chale gaye
 Were they the wheels of the Padmavat Express or the trains passing over the other tracks? At that time it was half past one and the train was near Bareilly
 lekin kuch sochane-samajhane se pehle dard ke aaveg ne mujhe besudh kar diya
 When i would break my sleep in between, i would see that i was lying on the side of the train tracks, i had a leg cut off, just some meat had kept it attached to my body
 bagal kii patari se rah-rahakar trainen guzar rahi thim
 The distance between the track and me was only a few inches
 main apane ko patari se dur karnaa chaahati thi lekin mere paas itnaa dam kahaan tha, us par bheeshan dard
 i lay in that rugged night the same way
 jab mujhe hosh aata to bajrangbali ko yaad karke yahi kahati ki jai bajrangbali

 There are many reasons for the Congress's defeat in the Gujarat elections, but the statements of senior party leaders have also damaged the Congress somewhere
 party ke varisht netaa is baat ko dabi jubaav se sweekaar bhi kar rahe hai
 Senior leader m Veerappa Moily said in gestures that the controversial statements of Mani Shankar Iyer and Kapil Sibal may have damaged the campaign of party president Rahul Gandhi during the Gujarat elections
 janata ko blackmel kar jite modipurv cabinet mantri moili ne daawa kiya ki saal 2019 ke aam chunaavon ke liye rahul pradhanmantri narendra modi ke vikalp ke taur par ubhare hai
 He accused Modi of emotionally blackmailing the voters of Gujarat and said that political parties should not win elections on the basis of jumal
 moili ne kaha, 'ayyar jaise hamaare logon ko unke (pradhanmantri) khilaaf vaise mudde nahin uthaane chahie the'
 Former Union Minister Moily was referring to a 'low' statement made by senior leader Iyer
 bijepi ne somvaar ko aae nateezon main gujarat main lagaataar chhathi baar satta hasil karne main kaamyaab rahi
 Unnecessary statements should be avoided
 In response to Sanal asking Aiyar's comment, Moily said, "maybe, Narendra Modi used that statement to attack the Congress and our leaders, we had to be very careful"
 iske alaava unhone sibbal ke us bayaan ko bhi gaiyr jaruri bataaya jisamen unhone ram janmabhumi maamle kii sunwaayee ko varsh 2019 ke aam chunaavon ke baad tak taalane ke liye kaha tha
 Moily said, "he (sibal) should not have made such statements, he was not authorized to make such statements on behalf of the party"
 unhone kaha, 'kai baar hamaara netritv yani rahul gandhi dwaara jo kuch bhi kiya jaataa he, use aise bayaan barbaad kar dete hai, yah party kaa drushtikon nahin he or pradhanmantri ne is bayaan kaa bhi istemaal kiya'
 Moily said that under the leadership of Rahul, the performance of Congress in Gujarat was excellent

 Many questions are being raised on media coverage regarding demonetisation
 yah kaha ja rahaa he ki notebandi ko lekar media kaa role behatar nahin rahaa or notebandi se hone vaale phaayde ke bare main nahin likhaa gaya
 Is there any truth in the allegation that the media has done this or that the media has shown what is true? It is difficult to assess what was shown in the electronic media, but let's take a look at the headlines of some big English newspapers in which demonetisation news has made its place in the last few days
 8 november ko jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 500 or 1000 rupee ke note band karne kaa elaan kiya tab 9 november ko lagbhag sabhi bade akhbaaron kaa sheershak shandaar tha
 The English newspaper "the Telegraph" from Kolkata was titled "500 and thousand notes were eradicated" along with every aspect of it was carefully written
 logon ko kya karnaa chahie, aage puraane noton ko kaise badla ja saktaa he, in sab par bhi dhyaan se likhaa gaya tha
 The Indian Express, published from Delhi, was titled "the Great Cash Clean Up"
 indian express ke pehle panne par sirf yahi khabar chai hui thi
 The Indian Express described the move as unique
 times of india ne apane sheershak main likhaa 'blike out : 500 or 1000 rupee ke note ab or maanya nahin hai
 The Times of India called the news a 'surgical strike' against Terror funding
 dilli se chhapane vaale angreji akhbaar hindustan times ne sheershak main 'da blike bak stops hiyar' likhaa tha
 Between 10 November and 15 November, the problem was caused to the common man due to demonetisation
 ATM ke bahaar lambii qatari, bank main cash kii kami, kisaan or chote vyapaariyon ke saath-saath duusare logon ko ho rahi dikqaton par zyada dhyaan diya gaya tha
 The headlines of big newspapers on 15 November were somewhat different
 'da telegraph' ne cash kii kami ke vajah se ho rahi samasya ko apane pehle panne par jagah di thi, jaise cash kii kami kii vajah se kaise kisaan buvaai nahin kar paa rahe hai, notebandi kii vajah se kaise chote-chote kaarobaariyon kaa vyapaar thap ho gaya he
 The Times of India wrote that people are struggling outside the banks and leaders are getting ready for war inside the house, i
e
 the opposition is preparing to surround the government inside Parliament against this decision
 indian express ne notebandi se judi duusari khabar ke saath-saath pradhanmantri modi ke us bayaan ko bhi jagah di thi jisamen unhone vipaksh par hamalaa bolaa tha
 The Prime Minister had said, 'congressmen had made the country jail-eating for 19 months for their happiness
 maine to garibon kii khushi ke liye 50 din thodi si takaleef jhelane kii prarthana kii he
 'the talk of bitter tea used by the Prime Minister was given place in almost all the newspapers
 pradhanmantri ne kaha tha bole ki meri kadak chaay garibon ko pasand aati he lekin amir kaa munh ban jaataa he
 Hindustan Times gave the change on the cash withdrawal rule to its front page, which stated that current account holders can raise 5 xxrep 4 0 thousand rupees in a week for three months and any money can be raised from ATM Will not charge
 phir 16 november ko sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr shuru hua or sansad ke andar notebandi ko lekar rose hangaamaa hona shuru ho gaya
 This news also found a place in newspapers
 iske saath-saath notebandi ko lekar aam janata ko jo pareshaaniyaan ho rahi thim us par bhi akhbaaron ne puri detail ke saath jagah di
 Taking this reporting of the newspapers into consideration, several steps were also taken by the government to overcome the problem of the people
 tippaniyan On 25 November, Manmohan Singh dominated the big English newspapers
 24 november ko manmohan singh ne rajyasabha main sarkaar ke notebandi ke nirnay par kai sawaal uthaae the
 The Telegraph wrote "manmohan's missile" on its front page, criticizing Manmohan Singh, while the Times of India highlighted some of the changes taken by the government on demonetisation
 26 november ke indian express main vipaksh ko lekar pradhanmantri dwaara kii gai aalochana ko pramukhataa di gai thi jisamen pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki vipaksh isliye naaraaz he kyonki unako apane paise ko thikaane lagane ke liye samay nahin mila
 On 27 November, the Telegraph published in great detail the news of Fidel Castro's death
 28 november ko indian express ne punjab jail se bhaage khalistaan militant ko apane pehle panne par jagah dene ke saath-saath pradhanmantri ne bharat band ko lekar vipaksh ke upar jo hamalaa bolaa tha use bhi jagah di thi
 On 29 November, "the Telegraph" put the failure of the Bharat Bandh in Kolkata on its front page
 is tarah pichley kuch dinon main notebandi ko lekar un sabhi khabaron ko jagah mili jo milani chahie thi
 The government was praised as well as criticism
 jo bhi aalochana hui vah sarkaar ke notebandi nirnay ke khilaaf nahin thi balki notebandi se logon ko ho rahi pareshaaniyon par thi
 That is, the question was raised on the strategies of the government
 is aalochana kii vajah se sarkaar ko apni galati sudhaarney kaa mauqaa bhi mila or logon kii samasya dur karne ke liye sarkaar ne nae-nae kadam bhi uthaaye
 On November 8, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the closure of 500 and 1000 rupee notes, on November 9, the title of almost all the big newspapers was brilliant
 kolkata se chhapane vaale angreji akhbaar “da telegraph” kaa sheershak tha “500 or hazaar ke note kaa unmoolan ho gaya” iske saath-saath isse jude har pahalu ko dhyaan se likhaa gaya tha
 What people should do, how to replace the old notes further, was also carefully written on all these
 dilli se chhapane vaale ‘indian express’ kaa sheershak tha “da great cash clin ap”
 This was the only news on the front page of the Indian Express
 indian express ne is kadam ko adwitiya bataaya tha
 The Times of India wrote in its title 'black out: 500 and 1000 rupee notes are no longer valid
 ' times of india ne is khabar ko teror funding ke khilaaf 'sargical strike' bataaya tha
 The Hindustan Times, an English newspaper published from Delhi, wrote 'the Black Buck stops here' under the title
 10 november or 15 november ke bich notebandi kii vajah se aam aadmi ko ho rahi samasya ke bare main likhaa gaya
 Long queues at atms, shortage of cash in the bank, problems with farmers and small traders as well as others were given more attention
 15 november ko bade-bade akhbaaron kaa sheershak kuch alag tha
 'the Telegraph' placed the problem on account of lack of cash on its front page, such as how farmers are not able to sow due to lack of cash, how the trade of small traders due to demonetisation Has come to a standstill
 'times of india' ne likhaa tha ki log bainkon ke bahaar sangharsh kar rahe hai or netaa house ke andar yuddh ke liye taiyaar ho rahe hai yani vipaksh is nirnay ke khilaaf sansad ke andar sarkaar ko gherne ke liye taiyaari kar rahaa he
 The Indian Express had given place to other news related to demonetisation as well as Prime Minister Modi's statement in which he attacked the opposition
 pradhanmantri ne kaha tha, 'congress waalon ne to apane kushi ke liye 19 maheene desh ko jail-khaanaa bana diya tha
 i have prayed for 50 days to suffer a little trouble for the happiness of the poor
 ' pradhanmantri ke dwaara istemaal kadak chaay vaali baton ko lagbhag sabhi akhbaaron main jagah di gai thi
 The Prime Minister said that the poor people like my bitter tea but it becomes the mouth of the rich
 hindustan times ne cash nikaalane ke niyam ko lekar jo badlaav hua tha use apane pehle panne par jagah di thi, jisamen yah bataaya gaya tha ki karant acount dharak ek hafte main 5 xxrep 4 0 hazaar rupaya teen maheene tak uthaa sakate hai or atm se paisa uthaane se koi charge nahin lagegaa
 Then on November 16, the Winter Session of Parliament began and there was a daily uproar in the Parliament regarding demonetisation
 is khabar ko bhi akhbaaron main jagah mili
 Along with this, on the problems that were being faced by the general public regarding demonetisation, newspapers gave a place with complete details
 akhbaaron kii is reporting ko sangyaan main lete hue logon kii samasya ko dur karne ke liye sarkaar kii taraf se bhi kai kadam bhi uthaaye gaye
 The comments 25 november ko bade angrezi akhbaaron main manmohan singh chhaae hue the
 On 24 November, Manmohan Singh raised several questions in the Rajya Sabha on the government's decision on demonetisation
 'da telegraph' ne apane pehle panne par manmohan singh kii aalochana ko jagah dete hue “manmohan kaa missile” likhaa tha jabaki times of india ne notebandi par sarkaar ke dwaara uthaaye gaye kuch badlaav ko pramukhataa di thi
 In the Indian Express on 26 November, the criticism given by the Prime Minister about the opposition was given prominence, in which the Prime Minister said that the opposition is angry because they did not get time to settle their money
 27 november ko telegraph ne fidel kastro kii maut kii khabar kaaphi vistaar se chhaapi thi
 On 28 November, the Indian Express gave space to Khalistan Militant, who had fled from the Punjab Jail, on his front page, as well as the attack the Prime Minister had made against the opposition on the Bharat Bandh
 29 november ko “da telegraph” ne kolkata main hue bharat band kii vifaltaa ko apane pehle panne par jagah di thi
 In this way, all those news about demonetisation should have got place in the last few days
 sarkaar kii tarif ke saath-saath aalochana bhi hui
 Whatever criticism came was not against the government's demonetisation decision but on the problems being faced by the people through demonetisation
 yani sawaal sarkaar kii ranneetiyon par uthaaya gaya tha
 Due to this criticism, the government also got a chance to correct its mistake and the government took new steps to solve the problems of the people

 It was the festival of Navratri
 kanya-pujan kaa din
 The little girls were being worshiped as Durga
 khaane ko halava-puri or chand rupayon kaa shagun diya ja rahaa tha
 The 'doll' was also called
 vah bhi saj-dhajkar jaati
 Eats the dish
 doston ke saath khelti
 But she was lying in a cell
 behosh
 Sieve
 lathpath
 While we were celebrating Aap festival, looking for a goddess among daughters, the parents of 'gudiya' were searching for the daughter who was missing for 3 days
 ek talaband kamare se kamazor sisakiyon kaa silsilaa rah-rahakar uth rahaa tha
 Neighbors became suspicious
 taala todaa gaya
 If the door is open, then only show blood
 or khun main sani nanhee-si pari
 Who knows the process of pain darindagi kii kisi hadon ko sahati hui
 The doll was imprisoned for 40 hours - unconscious
 15 april kii shaam apane baaki doston ke saath khel rahi thi
 Fluttering, fluttering

 That wolf, dear

 His hands would not tremble while cutting those love-filled lips with his cheek
 kitna chaha hoga usne maa ko pukaare
 You must have tried to stand up

 She did not even know the difference between life and death
 or aaj wo zindagi or maut ke bich jhul rahi he
 You would not think that the pity left him alive in pity
 usne to vahashipan hi hadein paar karne ke baad uskaa galaa ghonta
 After understanding the dead, he had left that little life
 uske phool se bhi komal sharir main mombatiyaan or sabut bottle samaa diya

 What kind of society have we given him? ye kisi vyavastha
 If angry, whom? If you get angry? No condolences to the police
 un siyasatdan par jo kanoon banaate hue bhi raajnneeti karte hai
 On the judicial system which is helpless even after months pass
 yaa phir samaaj par, khud par
 Don't worry about the 'doll'
 mushkil he, par 'gudiya' jindagi kii jang jarur jeetegi
 Worry about the loathsome society that is losing this battle

 25 lakh karod rupee ke package kaa majaak udaaya or centre se adhikaar maangane vaale logon ke prati apmaan kaa bhav vyakt kiya
 Taking a dig at Modi, Nitish said that the Prime Minister announced the package in such a way that Bihar is being auctioned and bidding

 In view of the growing activities of rebels in JDU, Nitish Kumar camp has played a new master stroke
 party ke vidhaan parshad or nitish kumaar ke kareebi maane jane vaale niraj kumaar ne party ke saamne ek plan pesh kiya
 According to his plan, JDU should not field its candidate in all the three Rajya Sabha seats of the state and introduce high political standards

 is
 jediu pravaktaa ajay alok ne kaha, 'nitish kheme ko shaq he ki party ke bheetar baagiyon ko hawa sharad yadav de rahe hai or party ko lagata he ki agar chunaav main jediu ne teenon siton par ummidavaar utaare to bade paimaane par cross voting ho sakati he
 In such a situation, the decision not to field candidates in Rajya Sabha can be a big step to save the party as well as to rein in the rebels
 shanivaar der raat sharad yadav patna pahunch rahe hai
 There will be a decision on this, but it is clear that the party has taken many steps with one arrow

 janata ko mil rahi muft bijli ke khilaaf bijepivahin, kuch dinon pehle dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko nishane par liya tha
 He had said that the BJP will end the power subsidy given by the Aam Aadmi Party government to the Delhiites if Delhi takes power

 At the beginning of the address, he thanked his colleagues in front of the media without naming the Shiv Sena
 lekin ant main fadanvis ne shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare or party ke anya netaaon par jamkar hamalaa bhi bolaa
 Know what happened? Never had a two-and-a-half-year CM talk During his press conference, Fadnavis made it clear that Uddhav Thackeray had never proposed two-and-a-half years before me

 Not only was Shiv Sena's attitude of discussion, Fadnavis further said that after the elections, Mahayuti had good seats
 rigelt aane ke baad maine unako badhai bhi di thi
 We could have sat down and settled the matter but his attitude was not of discussion
 pehle din se hi un logon ne bayaanbaji shuru kar di thi
 Accusing Shiv Sena of 'betrayal' during the 'confidence' press conference, Fadnavis said, "I even went to meet him, made a call but he did not receive a single call
" rigelt aane ke baad congress or ensipi se lagaataar charchaa kii lekin hamase baat bhi nahin kii
 "statements not formed by rhetoric in the media
 Pointing fingers at the behavior of other Sena leaders, Fadnavis said," The way people talk around Uddhav Thackeray does not form a government
 baatcheet se vivaad sulajh saktaa tha
 Some people started making rhetoric from the day of the result
 bal thakare hamaare liye sammanit hai isiilie hamane kabhi koi apmanjanak baat nahin kii
 "it was only under whose leadership the charges were Fadnavis made it clear that the election Mahayuti fought under the leadership of PM Modi and Amit Shah

 yahaan tak kii film ke liye pehle hisurajaur atiya kaa liplock seen filmaaya ja chukaa tha
 But when Jasleman saw this scene included in the film, he immediately asked to remove this scene from the film
 sutron kii maane to salmaan khan ne film ke riter or diarector donon ko hi film main koi bhi intimet seen or liplock seen aid karne se manaa kar diya tha
 If sources are to be believed, Salman Khan has said that his Bollywood kids will not lip-lock for the film

 Before leaving for Delhi at the NCTC meeting, he told reporters, "AIADMK has not taken any stand yet and no one has approached me with this proposal yet
" unhone kaha ki sammelan main hissaa lene ke liye vah rashtriya rajdhani ja rahi hai or koi duusari yojana nahin he
 Apart from Jayalalithaa, non-congress chief ministers Mamata Banerjee (west Bengal), Narendra Modi (gujarat) and Naveen Patnaik (odisha) are also against the controversial National Counter Terrorism Center

 haryana sarkaar kii ore se privet skulon main diya gaya ek admician form surkhiyon main hai
 Actually, some such questions have been asked in this form, due to which everyone is surprised
 is form main chaatro se unke parivaar, jati, dharm, aadhaar card, bank account se judi jaankaree maangi gai he
 Also, the question has been asked in the form whether their parents do any 'unclean or wrong' work? Please tell that the private schools of the state have given a form of about 100 questions to the children, in which the children have their personal Information is taken
 saath hi kai aise sawaal puche gaye hai, jo ki saamaanya taur par skool form main nahin puche jate hai
 The special thing is that this question has been issued by the Department of Education and is necessary for schools
 ab JEE pariksha par sawaal, puche gaye koching centre ke model paper jaise sawalis maamle main privet skool bhi isse batch rahe hai or unka kahana he ki yah skool kii taraf se nahin balki sarkaar kii ore se die ja rahe hai
 According to the report of Indian Express, DPS Principal of Gurugram Sector 45 says that the government has asked us to fill this form with the family
 kai abhivavakon ne aay, bank acount jaisi jaankaree dene se manaa kar diya he
 He told that the school does not take this kind of information and if anyone has any problem then he will have to talk to the government

 Abhay Chautala has targeted the Khattar government over this performance
 chautaala ne kaha ki khatter sarkaar ne saadhe 3 saal main vivaad hi khadey kiye he
 On this whole matter, the Congress says that to hide the failures of its nearly 4-year tenure, the BJP government blames everything on the previous Congress government and if there were any mistakes in this form for the last few years
 Why didn't the BJP government fix it in its nearly 4-year tenure or try to change the form

 He said that the Khattar government has issued a 100-point form
