 Considering the situation of the country and the upcoming elections, we have passed the resolution in the light of the National agenda of the NDA
 par puraa bhaashan sunen to lagata he, jediu kaa ek hi makasad he ki kisi bhi keemat par narendra modi bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar na bane
 We have just reminded the scope of the National Council
 nitish kumaar ne sari chizon ko vistaar se bataaya he ki kis tarah ek suba desh kaa model nahin ban saktaa
 Nitish or i have never named any particular person
 aap kehete hai ki topi pahanani padati he, tilak bhi lagaana padataa he
 BJP says you make communal statements? His (nitish's) statement means that India is a country full of many contradictions
 aise main majaar yaa mandir par janaa jaruri ho jaataa he
 Modi will say that he is ready to remain in the realm even then, would you mind him? He has been there for so many days, but has he said anything like this till now? So you are saying that if a radius is fixed and that scope If anyone is willing to walk, then you have no objection in the name of the leader? Someone should stay in that circle, we have no objection
 aisa lagata he ki nitish endie kaa saath chhodia chaahate hai or sharad yadav saath rahanaa chaahate hai
 We never give opinion
 ham tay karke jate hai
 i have prepared this resolution and it has been expanded by Nitish Kumar according to the circumstances of Bihar
 jediu or endie ke rishte bighad rahe hai
 On the other hand, UPA is trying to somehow get JDU defeated
 centre 12,000 karod ru
 Backward Region Grant Fund is going to be given to Bihar
 congress se rishta banegaa?pichhali baar panchavarshiya yojana ke tahat is yojana ko 5,000 karod ru

 Have met while we had asked for 20,000 crores
 vaise bhi hamaari sabase badi maang vishesh rajya kii he
 If the government is ready to give special state status, will it hold the Congress? No question
 vishesh rajya kii maang desh kii maang he
 It cannot have political meaning
 bijepi ke har netaa kaa bayaan sunakar lagata he ki modi ek lokapriy netaa hai or ve modi ko hi project karenge
 Ever since Nitish attacked, the entire party rallied
 hamaara gathbandhan bijepi se he
 Did BJP President Rajnath Singh have such a reaction? Nor did Nitish or i have such a reaction
 agar ek lokapriy netaa endie main ubhar rahaa he to jediu ko itani pareshaani kyon he?hamane kabhi kisi kaa naam nahin liya

 Kamlesh Paswan, MP from Bansgaon, says that if the cash has come for Gorakhpur, then obviously it will reach across the country
 ' When we asked the BJP leaders to confirm this claim, they referred to the news published in local newspapers recently
 sanyog se yah unheen dinon kii baat he jab piem modi ne upi main chunavi abhiyaan ched rakhaa tha
 However, the only media report related to this is dated December 17, published by the news agency IANS, according to which Rs 5000 crore has been sent by the RBI through a special plane in UP
 unhone kaha ki yah soochna ek adhikari se mili he jiskaa naam nahin bataaya ja saktaa
 When NDTV contacted RBI, their spokesperson clarified that the bank does not provide information about how much cash is being delivered in which state
 iske baavjood sthaneey bijepi saansad is baat kii taraf ishaara karte rahe ki arabiai par raajnneetik dabaav to banaaya ja rahaa he

 The comments singh ne kaha 'hamane amit shah se kaha tha ki arabiai se paisa transfar karne kii prakriya thodi or tej honi chahie taaki logon ko zyada dikkat pesh na aae

 ek mahila kahati he 'kal manager ne mujhe dhakka diya or meraa galaa pakad liya
 'there, some other people say that the situation has improved a bit in the last two days but still is not getting the full cash
 thodi der baad cash kaa ek baksaa bank kii shakha par pahunchataa he
 But it is not clear whether the reason for this inflow of cash is due to next year's UP assembly elections
 haalanki janata ko is baat se fark nahin padataa, vah to bas apane hisse kii nagdi jald se jald apane haathon main dekhnaa chaahate hai

 usne apni shikaayat main police adhikariyon ko bataaya tha ki jab vah so rahi thi to uski marji ke bina uske saath sex kiya gaya or uskaa video banaaya gaya
 The woman said that she came to know about this when one of her relatives saw the video on 30 May on Bron's Facebook page
 haalanki bron ne fasebuk par video aplod karne kii baat to maan lee thi, lekin uskaa daawa tha ki usne mahila kaa rape nahin kiya, balki usne uski marji se uske saath sex kiya
 Bronn said that the woman had given him approval that he could make a video of her by sleeping with her
 aath mahilaon or chaar purushon kii bench ne do din tak chali sunwaayee ke dauraan tamaam pakshon par gaur karne ke baad bron ko bari kar diya
 The court said, 'he cannot be punished simply because he uploaded the video on Facebook

 The woman's lawyer said that her client had no idea that Bron had sex with her at bedtime
 unhone kaha ki jab police ne bron ko giraftaar kiya to wo hans rahaa tha
 Not only this, he did not say anything in the police inquiry
 is par bron ne court ko bataaya ki mahila ne hi usase kaha tha ki sote vakt wo uske saath sex kare or use record bhi kar le taaki vah use agali subah dekh sake
 He said, 'I showed her the video at the behest of the woman in the morning and then she expressed her desire to have sex
 'jab bron ke vakil se poocha gaya ki usne fasebuk par video kyon post kiya to unhone kaha, 'mujhe nahin pataa'
 Bron said that he was laughing at the time of his arrest because he could not believe that the woman had accused him of rape
 usne bataaya ki ve donon mobile par ek-duusare ko antarang tasviren bhejte the
 Bron's friend Daniel Mardon told the court that the video was made with the woman's approval
 marden ne kaha ki vivaad tab khadaa hua jab bron ne video fasebuk par aplod kar diya
 Bron said in court, 'I was very upset because of this case

 After being charged, i was kept in custody for two weeks and given the title of a sex offender
 agar police ne apana kaam sahi se kiya hota to yah cese kabhi court main nahin jaataa

 america raashtrapati donald trump ne paris jalwaayu samjhaute se america ko alag karne kaa elaan kar diya he
 America's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement has slammed efforts to reduce global warming and protect the environment
 haalanki bharat ne america ke bagaiyr bhi is samjhaute se jude rahane kaa elaan kiya he
 This move by the US is not going to have any direct effect on India, but it will make it difficult for India to take fast steps towards the goal of further emission cuts, as it will now be difficult for India to get international finance and technology
 trump ke hatane se ab duniya ke duusare deshon ko global green house gas utsarjan lakshya ko hasil karne main mushkil hogi
 Some experts are believing that now the chances of emerging as a global climate leader of China have been raised
 china ke saath bharat or europea desh bhi paris jalwaayu samjhaute ko amal main laane ko lekar patibaddh hai
 However, it remains to be seen whether China will be able to meet the huge economic support that the world needs to achieve emission reduction targets
 haal main china kii arthvyavastha kii raftaar ghati he or use kai nai chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 To meet this goal, the United States had pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent by the year 2025 compared to 2005
 iskaa matlab yah he ki america apane carbon daai oxide utsarjan ko 7
 From 4 billion tonnes (year 2005) to 2 billion tonnes
 vaise america kaa carbon daai oxide utsarjan str ghatakar 6
 Up to 8 billion tonnes has been reached
 vaise to trump ne samjhaute se baahar hone ke baavjood utsarjan lakshya ko chhodane kii baat to nahin kii he, lekin unhone is lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye jaruri kadamon ko lagu hone se roak diya he
 India has set a very ambitious target
 Now that the US has pulled back, it means that other countries of the world will have to increase the emission reduction target to achieve the global goal
 yah kaaphi mushkil baat hogi, kyonki bharat, europea sangh jaise kai desh pehle se hi utsarjan katautee main kaaphi mahatvakankshi lakshya bana chuke hai
 Difficult to get technology resources The kind of financial and technology resources that America could provide is not enough for countries like India or China
 bharat ne saal 2030 tak apane utsarjan ko prati jidipi ikai utsarjan ko (saal 2005 ke mukaable) 2030 tak 35 se 33 fisadi tak katautee karne kii baat kahi he
 India has said that by 2030 it will spend at least 40 percent of its total power generation with fossil fuels
 sanyukt kaaryakramon par nahin hoga koi asarklin energy or jalwaayu parivartan ke bare main bharat evam america ke bich kai sanyukt kaarykram chalaae ja rahe hai

 input bhashaa se The case of the death of Anishia Batra, an airhostess who fell from the roof in the posh Hauz Khas area of delhi, is still complicated
 lekin marane se pehle anisia ne jo aakhri massej bheje the, wo massej saaf-saaf bataa rahe hai ki anisia ne apni maut kaa jimmedaar kise bataaya he
 On the complaint of Anishia's mother, the police have arrested Mayank Singhvi's husband Mayank Singhvi and her mother-in-law in a dowry murder case and arrested Mayank
 mayank ko police ne aaj court main pesh kiya, jahaan se use 14 din kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya he
 Meanwhile, the police also conducted a post-mortem of Anishia's body again and made a full video recording of it
 saath hi police ne bataaya ki visra jaanch ke liye visra kaa namoona bhi le liya gaya he
 However, the plot of Anishia's death has been complicated so far
 anisia ke pati mayank singhvi kaa jahaan kahana he ki anisia ne chetavanee bharaa massej bhejne ke baad chat se kudakar khudakushi kar lee, vahiin anisia ke mata-pita or bhai kaa aarope he ki anisia kii hatya kii gai
 On Monday, the police and FSL team reached Mayank's house
 jaanch team ne bataaya ki anisia ne chat par jahaan se chalaang lagaai, vahaan uski chappal padi mili
 One of Anishia's slippers was kept upright while the other was lying upside down
 ek sidhi or ek ulti padi ye chappal bataa rahi hai ki agar usne khudakushi kii to kitni badhavaasee main kii
 And if it was dropped from the top, then it was deceived in such a way that there was no chance to recover
 yah tha anisia kaa aakhri miserenishia ne marane se pehle apane pati mayank, bhai karan batra or maa suman batra ko kii massej kiye
 All these messages are telling that Anishia was going to take some big decision in life and how much she was struggling
 usne bhai or maa se help bhi maangi thi or ishaara bhi kiya tha ki uski jaan ja sakati he
 The postmortem of the reworked body was written in a message sent by her to her brother, "please help me
" police ko bulaao
 It has locked me in the room
 or isane meraa phone le liya tha
 i just got back my phone
 pleez help me, pleez kol da police
 'at least these last messages of Anishia are clearly stating that she has clearly held Mayank responsible for her death
 anisia ke bhai karan batra ne bataaya ki ghatana vaale din anisia ne unhen massej bhejkar help maangi thi
 Anishia wrote in the message, 'mayank has locked me in the room
 ye aadmi mayank meri jindagi le rahaa he
 Do not leave it
 ye aadmi hi jimmedaar he meri maut or jindagi kaa
 i am taking a big step in my life
 'honeymoon par airhostess kii hui thi pityeevahin anisia ke pati mayank kaa kahana he ki marane se pehle anishia ne apane gharavaalon kii tarah ek massej use bhi kiya tha
 Anishia wrote in a message sent to Mayank, 'you will see my dead face now, i am going to die
 'bakaul mayank jab use ye massej mila to vah ghar kii pehali manzil par tha or massej milte hi vah chat kii taraf dauda
 But by then Anishia had jumped from the roof and with the help of neighbors, she immediately admitted Anishia to the nearest hospital
 magar anishia is duniya ko chhodkar ja chuki thi

 Poem 1: Broken shattered poet: Shamsher Bahadur Singh, scattered shattered tea leaves under the crimped leg of my poet, shrouded with scum, still clinging to fallen neck
 
 
 
 Something like this, my skin was different from me, found in the soil - Sidharpahar - After the sun-hopping sticks waiting in the dust like my ribs
 
 
 khaali bore sujon se rafu kiye ja rahe hai
 
 
 
 jo meri aankhon kaa suunaapan hanthand bhi muskaraahat liye hue he jo kii meri dost he 
 The pigeons chanted a ghazal
 
 
 main samaj naa sakaa, radif kaafie kya the itnaa khafif, itnaa halkaa, itnaa meetha unka dard tha 
 Ganga sand is shaking like a mirror in the sky
 main usee main keechad kii tarah so rahaa hum or chamak rahaa hum kahin
 
 
 Don't know where meri bansuri he ek naav kii patavaar- jiske swar geele ho gaye hai chap chap chap meraa hryday kar rahaa he chap
 Splash
 vah paidaa hua he jo meri mrityu ko sanvaarane vaala he 
 i have opened the shop where the medicines of "poison" are smiling - there is a lot of love in their injection sticks
 vah mujh par hans rahi he, jo mere hothon par talue ke bal khadi he magar uske bal meri peeth ke neeche dabe hue hai or meri peeth ko samay ke baarik taron kii tarah khurch rahe hanusake chumban kii spasht parachhaaiyaan muhar banakar uske taluon ke thappe se mere muh ko kuchal chuki hai uskaa seenaa mujhako piskar baraabar kar chukaa he 
 Lay me on the mountains of thirst where i am yearning like a waterfall
 mujhako suraj kii kirnon main jalane do - taaki uski aanch or lapat main tum fuwwaron kii tarah nachomujhako junglee phulon kii tarah os se tapakane do taaki unki dabi hui khushbu se apane palkon kii unindi jalan ko tum bhiga sako, mumkin he to
 Yes, you speak to me, as the blushing cries of my door raise questions
 
 
 
 From the countless rooms in my heart, you love me like the fish do with the waves
 
 
 
 In which they do not get trapped like the wind blows from my chest, which cannot be suppressed to the deep you love me like i do to you, dissolve in the light and write me in the sky and read me
 aainon, muskuraao or mujhe maar daalo 
 Aino, i am your life
 It did not bite - there was only a very black, very long sliver that was covered in the ground
 
 
 
 Where my feet were lost
 motiyon ko chabaata hua sitaron ko apni kanakhiyon main ghulaata hua, mujh par ek zindaa itrpash banakar baras padaa 
 And then i saw that i am just a breath that has settled in its droplets, which will be stuck in a dream like a string in your chests, knocking badly
 i could not make any punishment on her feet because my bowing did not bend the direction of her feet
 i was lost with my eyes
 jab tum mujhe mili, ek khulaa fata hua lipapha tumhaare haath aayaa bahut ulta-palta - usamen kuch naa tha - tumne use phek diya - tabhi jaakar main neeche padaa hua tumhen 'main" laga 
 You even bowed down to pick him up, but thinking of something again left me there
 main tumse yon hi mil liyameri kavita kii tumne khub daad di - maine samajha tum apni hi baaten suunaa rahe ho 
 You wrapped me in the color of my poetry, you wrapped me in the color: and when the wrap is not open - you burn me
 mujhe, jalte hue ko bhi tum dekhte rahe: or vah mujhe acha lagata rahaa 
 a scent that has settled in my eyelids like a gesture, like a little spelling of your name, a little sweet, oblique spelling, ah, the tip of a stub that was stuck in your picnic with your teeth
 , i still sleep in my sleep
 agar mujhe kisi se irshyaa hoti to main doosraa janm baar baar har ghante letaa jaataa: par main to isi sharir main amar hoon tumhaari barkatabahut se tir, bahut si naaven, bahut se par idhar udate hue aaye, ghoomte hue guzar gaye mujhako liye sabake sab 
 You thought that you were among them
 nahin, nahin, nahin 
 There was no one among them
 sirf beeti hui anhoni or honi kii udhaas ranginiyaan thim

 You can go to any government event in any city of the country, from block level to Vigyan Bhawan in Delhi, people will see bottled drinking water in front of the people, even in the programs where there is discussion or announcement on big drinking water projects
 Are you saath hi yah bhi gaur kariye ki jis bhi shahar main yah samvaad ho rahaa hota he, vahaan sarkaar pehle se hi yah daawa karti he ki pipe line se jo pani kii supplai ho rahi he, vah puri tarah surakshit he
 Certificates are issued for this
 agar shaharon kii peyajal supplai surakshit he to bottleband pani or ghar-ghar main water filter yaa water poryphaire kyon lag rahe hai? aise main jab megi ke bahaane khaane kii chizon main mili jehar par charchaa karke desh fursat main hua he, tab yah bahes karne main koi harj nahin hoga ki hamaare shaharon ko kitna pani chahie or unke paas kitne pani kaa jugad he
 Also, how reliable is the water it is getting
 doctoron kii maane to ek swasth vyakti ko din bhar main aath se 12 gilaas pani pinaa chahie
 In this way, every person needs barely two and a half liters for drinking and the entire country needs 300 crore liters of water everyday
 aise main tehri baandh (kshamta 4 ghan kilometre yaa 40,000 karod litre) jaise teen baandhon kaa puraa pani pine main istemaal kiya jaae to desh kii 120 karod aabaadi ke liye saal bhar kaa peya jal uplabdh ho saktaa he
 And then there are hundreds of dams, thousands of rivers and more than 6 lakh ponds in our country, so why water shortage? And why even today 70 percent of diseases in this country are related to the consumption of impure water
 pani kii killat kaa rajyah saare sawaal isliye hai kyonki desh main pani kaa ganit utana sidhaa nahin he, jitna upar se najar aata he
 Actually, there is no separate structure for drinking water and domestic supply of water in India
 aise main bhartiya maanak beuro (biies) ne har vyakti ke liye rojaanaa pani kii jarurat 150 litre se 200 litre tak aanki he
 On the other hand, per capita water availability is decreasing in proportion to the increasing population
 aadhikarik aankadon ke mutabik aazaadee ke vakt 1947 main jahaan prati vyakti salanaa 6,042 ghan meter pani uplabdh tha, vahiin 2011 kii janaganana ke baad yah uplabdhta mahaj 1,545 ghan meter yani ek chauthai rah gai
 Cities have failed to meet this need
 shahari vikaas mantralay kii taraf se loksabhaa main 35 pramukh shaharon main jal aapurti ke bare main pesh aankadon main saaf dikhataa he ki 30 shaharon ko unki jarurat se kam pani mil rahaa he
 At the same time, claims made for supply according to demand for water in 2021 are Hawaii (see: map of water demand and supply in 35 cities and future water demand)
 2021 main pani kii aapurti ko lekar zyaadaatar shaharon ne kaha he ki udyog apane liye pani kii vyavastha khud karenge
 If campaigns like Make in India are to succeed, there should be some concrete answer to this challenge of the industry
 isi sawaal ko aage badhaate hue paryaavaran kaaryakarta anupam mishra poochhate hai, ''sarkaar to pehle hi shaharon ke pani kii maang ko gata kar dikhaa rahi he or yah ghati maang bhi puri nahin ho paa rahi
 Large parts of cities are using ground water through boring
 isse bhoojal kaa str teji se gir rahaa he
 According to the report prepared by the erstwhile Planning Commission on urban and industrial water supply for 2012 to 2017, "73% of people in cities with more than one lakh population are getting drinking water supply
 jitne pani kii aapurti kaa daawa kiya jaataa he uskaa 40 se 50 fisadi pani 'gaayab' ho jaataa he
 According to the expert group formed for water supply for the 12th Five Year Plan, there are major policy shortfalls in drinking water supply
 report main kaha gaya- aaj koi shahar apane jalaashyon ko apni jalaapurti kaa hissaa nahin bananaa chahta
 Instead, these reservoirs are seen as precious land
 jameen kaa yah gaddha pehle kooday se bharaa jaataa he or uske baad ise real estate ke liye le liya jaataa he
 The poor thrown out of the city encroach into the catchment area of the reservoir
 or ant main is par amiron kaa kabja ho jaataa he, jo ise ghar banane se lekar airport banane tak kisi bhi kaam main istemaal karte hai
 Policy needs to be changed in this situation
 - yaheen mishra yaad dilaate hai ki kis tarah dilli airport ke nirmaan main 7 talab khatm kar die gaye, jo kahin na kahin pine ke pani ke strot yaa bhoojal richarge karne ke kaam aate
 Wastage of water: On the one hand, cities are destroying their water sources, on the other hand, in the system of bringing water from miles away to the city, there is a lot of water on the way
 jaraa maharashtra ke nagpur shahar ke bare main planning kamishan kii isi report kaa ansh dekhie- nagpur ke liye 765 emeldi pani shahar se 40 kimi
 The distance comes from 'pench Forest and Tiger Reserve'
 isamen se 140 emeldi pani to nahar main hi kharch ho jaataa he
 125 MLD of water becomes waste after treatment with raw water
 pipe line se supplai ke dauraan or pani kii chori ke kaaran 235 emeldi pani gaayab ho jaataa he
 Apart from this, 45 MLD water bills are not recovered
 is tarah shahar sirf 200 emeldi pani kaa bill vasuul kar paata he
 The Planning Commission makes it clear that the condition of Nagpur is more or less similar to the supply of drinking water in all cities of the country
 isiilie bade shaharon ke upnagareey ilaake pipeline se vanchit rah jate hai or vahaan nagar nigam ke pani ke tankeron ke saamne lambii kantaren dikhne lagati hai
 Even where water reaches, there are thousands of types of eggs drifting about its cleanliness
 bimariyon ko nyotapani kii yah chori or barabaadi do tarah se bimariyon ko nyotaa detii he
 If the pipeline is leaking or water is stolen from it, then there is a possibility of bacteria coming in it
 aise bhi maamle saamne aate rahe hai, jab is tarah kii vajahon se siver kaa pani pine ke pani main mil jaataa he
 Even if these matters are few, but they do remove the fear in the minds of the people
 duusare, jin ilaakon main pani nahin pahunchataa, vahaan ke log bhoojal kaa betaratib dohan karte hai
 In NCR, ground water is being rapidly depleted in Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad
 kendriya bhoojal board ke mutabik bhoojal ke betahasha dohan se desh ke bade ilaake main bhoojal main arsenic, craloride or anya tarah kii ashuddhiyaan aa gai hai
 (see map) Due to these, boring or hand pump water is not very safe
 yahi saare kaaran jaljanit bimariyon kaa khatra paidaa karte hai
 Countering this, a senior Delhi-based Board of Quality Control at the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) questions, "the Water Board is supplying better water than the World Health Organization (WHO) standards and 100 water purity every day
" More samples are taken
 lekin hamaare paas nijee companiyon jaisaa prachaar tantra nahin he or na hi koi hema malini hamaare product kii guarantee le rahi hai
 "they claim that the water mafia maligns government institutions that supply water and spread their business by basing some untoward incidents

 According to the report 'homewater Purifier Industry 2014-19' by Velunotes, a private research organization for industries, the business is registering a growth rate of 22%
 2014 main home water purifaire udyog kaa aakaar 3,400 karod ru
 And by 2019 it was Rs 9,000 crore
 kaa aankada paar kar jayega
 The report points to several interesting facts, such as the highest sales of water purifiers are at the end of June and the beginning of July, ie at the time of the arrival of monsoon
 darasal yahi vah samay bhi hota he, jab jaljanit bimaariyaan sabase zyada failati hai or nadiyon main baadh ke kaaran supplai jal kaa gandalaapan bad jaataa he
 The report points to another interesting fact that the water purifier sales in Raipur jumped by 40% last year when there was an outbreak of jaundice in the city
 report taiyaar karne vaali research analist priyaali shah ne india today ko bataaya, ''is tarah kaa spasht trand dikhaata he ki jin ilaakon ne jaljanit bimariyon kaa prakope jhela he, vahaan water purifaire kii bikri main tej ijapha hua he
 Bottled water is the second part of the water business
 audyogic sanstha asocham kii report ke mutabik 2013 main desh main bottleband pani kaa kaarobaar 7,000 karod ru
 And it was Rs 16,000 crore in 2018
 kaa hoga
 Bisleri, pepsico, Coca Cola, Dhariwal and Parle have 67% share in this market
 branded bottleband pani ke alaava bhi bade paimaane par pani kii botalon kii gharelu supplai or pani paauch kaa kaarobaar bhi chal rahaa he
 But its reliability is doubtful
 kaise milegaa sabko saaf panikendriya peyajal evam swatchta rajyamantri ram kripal yadav kehete hai, ''peyajal aapurti rajya kaa vishay he
 The work of water supply in cities is done under the supervision of the municipal body and the gram panchayat of water supply in the villages

 Devendra Fadnavis has become CM and Ajit Pawar is sworn in as the Deputy Chief Minister
 haalanki ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne saaf kar diya he ki yah hamaari party kaa faisla nahin he
 This means that Ajit Pawar has finally disbanded the NCP to hold on to the political legacy of Sharad Pawar, who is called the Maratha Kshatrap of Maharashtra
 sharad pavaar ke baad supriya sule ne bhi kah diya he ki ensipi tut gai he
 Supriya said that the family and the party were divided
 ajit pavaar kaa bijepi ko samarthan dene ke faisleko bhale hi sharad parivaar ke is kalah ko jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 However, Ajit Pawar has been considered the real heir of Sharad Pawar's political legacy

 Ajit expressed his desire to become Deputy Chief Minister just after the 2009 assembly elections in Maharashtra
 haalanki, us dauraan unki jagah chagan bhujabal ko maharashtra kaa up mukhyamantri pad ke liye chunaa gaya tha
 There was a change in the politics of Maharashtra
 naatakeey rup se disambar 2010 main ajit kii ichha puri hui or ve up mukhyamantri bane
 Then in 2013, his name was linked to a controversy
 ajit kaa naam ek sinchai ghotaale main aayaa or phir unhen apane pad se istipha dene ke liye majaboor kiya gaya
 However, Ajit Pawar later became deputy CM
 ajit pavaar kii jagah beti ko tarjeehavahin, sharad pavaar kii beti supriya sule ne raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa or unhone apane ko sthapit bhi kar liya
 Sharad Pawar was now preferring his daughter Supriya Sule over Ajit Pawar
 wo supriya sule ko apni raajnneetik viraasat saunpna chaahate the, ajit pavaar bhi yah baat bakhubi jaanate the, isliye unhone apana raajnneetik bhavishya surakshit karnaa zyada behatar samajha or ensipi ko todakar bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kaa faisla kiya he
 Ajit Pawar looked like he was getting less preference now
 is bich ensipi ne maharashtra kii bijepi-shivasena sarkaar ke khilaaf yatra nikaali, lekin uskaa netritv ajit pavaar ko saunpane ke bajaay sharad pavaar ne party ke do duusare netaaon ko diya tha
 Ajit's heart is firmly confirmed in the fact that an attempt is being made to shore him up, so Ajit Pawar resigned from the Assembly membership of the election
 usee din yah baat sabit ho gai thi ki pavaar parivaar main sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa
 Who will be the political successor? However, Supriya Sule did not pay attention in the politics of the state earlier
 vah apane sansadeey kshetra baraamati main hi sakriy rahati thim, lekin is chunaav main jis tarah se sakriy huin or pita ke saath kandhe se kandhe milakar saath najar ain
 With this, the question was started that who would be the political successor of Sharad Pawar in NCP? Ajit Pawar or Supriya Sule? However, at that time Supriya said that Ajit Pawar is his elder brother and he is our leader
 meraa kaary kshetra dilli tak simit hoga, iske baad us vakt in charchaaon par viraam lag gaya tha, lekin ajit pavaar ne jis tarah se party ko todakar sarkaar banaai he, ise pavaar kii viraasat kii kabiz hone kii jang ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he

 Usendi is a senior tribal leader of Bastar region and in the year 1993 he was elected to the undivided Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha for the first time
 vah varsh 2008 se varsh 2013 ke dauraan raman mantrimandal ke sadsy bhi rahe hai
 He was elected to the Kanker Lok Sabha seat in the year 2014 after being elected from Antagarh assembly seat in 2013
 varsh 2000 main chhattisgarh rajya kaa nirmaan hone ke baad varsh 2004 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main bhartiya janata party ko 11 main se 10 siton par jeet mili thi
 In this election, former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi won from Congress ticket from Mahasamund
 bhaajapa ne is jeet ko varsh 2009 or 2014 main bhi kaayam rakhaa
 In these elections too, BJP won 10 out of 11 seats
 congress ko varsh 2009 main ekmaatr korba seat (charandas mahant) par tathaa varsh 2014 main durg seat (tamradhvaj sahu) par hi jeet mil saki thi
 But it is not easy for the BJP to sustain this victory in the Lok Sabha elections due this year
 haal hi main hue vidhansabha chunaav main rajya kii 90 main se 68 siton par congress ne, 15 siton par bhaajapa ne tathaa saat siton par ajit jogi kii party janata congress chhattisgarh (je) or basapa gathbandhan ne jeet hasil kii he
 In this election, the Congress has got the support of the tribals and Congress candidates have won 25 of the 29 tribal seats in the state
 vahiin teen adivasee siton par bhaajapa ne tathaa ek maatr seat par jogi kii party ne jeet hasil kii he
 After losing the support base on tribal seats in the state, the BJP has again given the command to the tribal leader as the state president
 vaise rajya nirmaan ke baad se nandkumar saay, shivapratap singh, vishnudev saay or ramsevak pakara jaise adivasee netaa bhi pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 But this time the situation is different and the road is not easy for Usendi
 haalanki bhaajapa ko ummid he ki usendi ke pradesh adhyaksh niyukt hone se party ko adivasee varg kaa ek baar phir saath milegaa
 BJP state spokesperson Sachchidananda Upasane says that since the creation of the state, the party has given leadership to most of the tribal sections
 usendi bastar kshetra ke varisht adivasee netaa hai or vah lagaataar sakriy bhi hai
 The party will definitely benefit from his image
 idhar congress ke media vibhaag ke adhyaksh shailesh nitin trivedi kaa kahana he ki isbaar vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko teen chauthai bahumat mila he
 The state government is continuously working in the tribal interest
 aane vaale loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa kii haar tay he
 In such a situation, the role of Vikram Usendi is being made as the state president of the BJP, to throw the blame on his head
 rajya main raajnneetik maamalon ke jaankaar or varisht patrkaar ramesh naiyar kehete hai ki beete vidhansabha chunaav main adivasee siton par bhaajapa ko badi haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Any tribal leader who has won the election from BJP has won because of his influence
 aise main vikram usendi in siton par bahut zyada prabhaav daal paaenge yah kah paanaa kathin he
 Of the 11 Lok Sabha seats in the state, four are reserved for Scheduled Tribes and one for Scheduled Castes
 lagbhag 32 fisadi adivasee aabaadi vaale rajya main usendi is chunaav main kitna prabhaav daal pate hai yah aane vaala samay hi batayega

 pradeep choudhary nakud or gangoh se teen baar vidhayak rah chuke hai
 Pradeep, who belongs to Gurjar community, has also lived in RLD, Congress and Samajwadi Party

 The day of the Kejriwal government comes to some contravention
 abhi jis tareeke se cabinet main pherbadal kar ke ek-ek mantri ko 7,8 or yahaan tak 11 mantralay die gaye hai isse yahi samaj aa rahaa hai ki dilli ke vikaas kii gati kya hone vaali
 Clearly, if a minister will be charged with the responsibility of so many ministries, how will the work be done
 isi baat par bijepi or congress ne bhi 'aap' par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Kejriwal and his party have been called the perpetrators of Delhi
 bijepi pradesh adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ke mutabik 'kejariwal apni rashtriya mahatvakankshaon ko puraa karne main itane vyast hai ki unhen dilli kii koi khabar nahi hai or iskaa khamiyaja janata bhugat rahi he'
 The Congress also raised questions on the Aam Aadmi Party on the Chief Minister's visits to other states and the cabinet reshuffle
 congress ke mutabik aap kaa dilli main kaam karne ke bajaae duusare rajyon ke chunaav jeetne par zyada dhyaan he
 The brunt of which innocent people of Delhi are suffering
 congress ke purv netaa jepi agarwal ne bhi apane bayaan main aap ko khub khari-khari sunai
 Amidst all these allegations and counter-allegations, AAP and his ministers considered all these things as baseless and considered the people of Delhi to be paramount and also said that the entire focus of the Chief Minister remains only on Delhi
 dilli ke swasthy mantri satendra jain jinke paas ab kul 7 mantralay hai unhone in baton ko nakaarte hue kaha kii ham din raat dilli kii seva main hi lage hue hai

 ‚Äô The Medical Council of India (MCI) has made some amendments to the Undergraduate Medical Curriculum
 embibies silebus main yah badlaav 17 saal main pehali baar hua he
 According to the new syllabus, now the students of the first year will not only take theoritical knowledge but will also handle the cases of patients
 haal hi main chennai main yojit ek press confeence main MCI ke chif kansaltent doctor em rajalakshmi ne kaha ki embibies kii maujuda paathyakram kii gunvattta badhaane kii prakriya main jo sanshodhan kaary chal rahaa tha vah lagbhag puraa ho chukaa he
 Currently MCI is busy applying for copyright so that syllabus can be put on the website
 MCI ke ek sutara se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, MCI ne 2011 main 'vijan 2015' ke naam se prastaavit silebus ko swasthya mantri ko bheja tha lekin vivaadon main fanse hone kii vajah se vah lagu nahin ho paaya
 After this, the Supreme Regulatory body of doctors has revised the syllabus back in 2014 and submitted the latest version
 1997 main embibies karikulam main pramukh sudhaar kii jarurat dekhi gai thi jisko dekhte hue pratham varsh ke liye shaikshanik varsh kii avadhi 18 maheene se ghataakar 12 maheene kar di gai thi
 With this, new concepts were introduced in medical education in 2007, but the new concepts were only added to the existing syllabus
 vartmaan main MCI ne silebus ko apadet karne ke alaava ek nai pahal bhi kii he
 MCI has also proposed to train medical teachers
 kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki nae karikulam kii madad se abhi tak jis tarah kii medical ajukeshan students ko di jaati rahi he or jo yogyata kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa rahaa he usamen badlaav hoga
 Students will no longer have to wait for the second year for clinical practice, but now the facility of clinical practice will be provided in the first year itself
 vellore ke chrishchiyan medical college main sthit MCI ke riginal centre ke kanviner doctor dhyakani selvakumar ne kaha ki medical ke pehle saal main zyaadaatar collejon main keval theory padhai jaati he, lekin maujuuda samay ko dekhte hue hamen students ko jald se jald marijon se milwaanaa hoga taaki ve practical nolej hasil kar saken
 According to the new syllabus, radiology and surgery will also be taught in the first year of medicine, which will allow MBBS doctors to develop diagnostic and analytical competence in clinical evaluation
 doctor selvakumar ke mutabik MCI ko is baat kaa ehsaas he ki undergraduate medical ajukeshan main badlaav kii jarurat he kyonki yah jaruri nahin he ki jo students embibies kii padhai karte hai vah piji bhi karen
 There are also many students who practice after MBBS and the new syllabus will be very helpful for the students going to practice
 iske alaava doctors or students kaa maananaa he ki maujuuda paathyakram padhane main kaaphi samay lag jaataa he jo baad main speshligeshan kar rahe students ke liye koi kaam kaa nahin hota
 According to sources, the new syllabus will have 17 additional subjects

 Kinsinger named the al-qaeda, Taliban and Haqqani networks as saying that the Pakistani government is not taking appropriate action against terrorist organizations, so we have to make it clear that we can cross any border if necessary

 The villagers told that Zaheerullah sells amulets etc
 and he said all this in greed

 Some men also told about this
 aisi baton ke khilaaf samudaay se hi aawaaj uthni chahie
 Apart from this, it should be declared illegal, seeking any legal remedy
 jaise hindoovivaah kodelagu he aise hi muslimon ke liye bhi kanoon ko kodyphoid kiya janaa chahie
 This should include not only halala but also other issues
 noorjahan ne kaha ki aisi baton ke khilaaf purush or mahilaayein cese darj karaane saamne nahin aaenge kyonki log ulema or kaajiyon par aankh band kar bharosa karte hai or unke har shabd ko gambhirtha se lete hai
 These people know that it is not part of the Quran
 naa hi iskaa koi dharmik aadhaar he
 If the practice of triple talaq is banned by the court then it (nikah Hallala) will stop on its own

Lal said, 'is the thinking behind this that the leaders of banned organizations will not be held responsible for the acts of their group? Do we now intend to deal with one of the most serious threats to international security and peace? ' Lal questioned whether the answer to questions raised by India on the functioning of the UN sanctions system would be 'deafening silence'? He said the same happened with the meeting of the Security Council Committee 1988 held last month on issues related to Afghanistan
