 In such a situation, the figures that i have may not be correct today, yet by telling them we have to fulfill our duty
 
 
 to lijie, sarkari aankadon ke mutabik hamaare desh main 23

 aise main jab maine akhbaar main padhaa ki america main food and drugs administration ne ab 'over da counter home echivi test' ko manzuri de di he to main duvidha main thi
 
 
 Will it be a good option for India as well
 
 
 ? After all, in the country where the citizens are shy about buying contraceptives, do people even go to get their disease checked
 
 
 kya aise halaat main ghar par hi baithkar agar aapako koi disha mil jaae to isamen harz hi kya he
 
 
 But then i remembered another news, which i had read a few days ago
 
 
 ek aids peedit, jo kabhi mumbai main autochaalak tha, ne do din pehle hi khudakushi kii or jate-jate apane khat main apni patni kii beemaari kaa khulaasa bhi kar gaya
 
 
 Then i thought that this man must have had some compulsions - financial constraints, social exclusion, depression or self-guilt - but the question arises, why did this man ruin the rest of his wife's life
 
 
 use besahaara to chhod hi gaya, jo beemaari shaayad usne khud hi apni patni ko di ho, vah saare samaaj ko bataa bhi gaya
 
 
 Now what choice does that woman have left
 
 
 aise main is tarah ke peedit koi galat kadam na uthaa len, uske liye neshnal aids control organizeshan (NACO) kaa suzav he - counselling
 
 
 My question is that if a person finds himself suffering from AIDS in his home without any counseling support, will his mental condition be such that he can understand his condition and think something for his future
 
 
 main kisi bhi test ke khilaaf yaa paksh main raay nahin dena chaahati, lekin donon tarah ke sawaal khadey karnaa chaahati hum
 
 
 Probably a test done in the privacy of the house will allow more people to get their tests done for this disease than now, and people can get treatment in time
 
 
 lekin vahiin duusari mushkil yah he ki kya rog ke bare main jaanane ke baad ve log sahi madad kii taraf haath badhayenge, yaa samaaj ke dar se chupchaap koi galat raah chun lenge
 
 
 The comments ek daleel yah bhi di ja sakati he ki har chiz kii chwis honi chahie
 
 
 If our country has the right to choose in every aspect of life, than many developed countries of the world, then why not here
 
 
 har insaan ko chunane kaa haq ho ki vah ghar par test chahta he yaa nahin
 
 
 Those who do not, do not buy the kit
 
 
 khayr, daleelein bahut hai
 
 
 The test is currently developed in the US, and NACO has already refused to bring it to India
 
 
 lekin main bina kisi pakshpaat ke sawaal uthaati hum - kya yah faisla sahi he

 In such a situation, if you get any direction by sitting at home, then what is the harm in this? 
 
 lekin phir mujhe yaad ai ek or khabar, jo maine kuch din pehle padhi thi
 
 
 An AIDS sufferer, who was once an auto driver in Mumbai, committed suicide two days ago and on his way out revealed his wife's illness
 
 
 tab maine sochaa ki is insaan kii koi majaburiyaan rahi hongi - aarthik tangi, saamaajik bahishkaar, depressant yaa aatm−glani - lekin sawaal uthta tha, yah shaks apni patni kaa baaki jivan kyon barbaad kar gaya
 
 
 He was left destitute, the disease which he may have given to his wife himself, he was also told to the whole society
 
 
 ab us mahila ke paas kya chaara rah jaataa he
 
 
 In such a situation, the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) suggests that such victims should not take any wrong step
 
 
 meraa sawaal he ki yadi kisi insaan ko apane ghar main bina kisi counselling saport ke apane aids se grasit hone kaa pataa chalata he, to kya uski maansik haalat aisi hogi ki vah apni is sthiti ko samaj sake or apane bhavishya ke liye kuch soch sake
 
 
 i do not want to give an opinion against any test or in favor, but i want to raise both questions
 
 
 shaayad ghar kii privesi main kiye gaye test se ab se zyada logon main is beemaari ke liye apni jaanch karaane kii razaamandi paidaa ho jaae, or usase vakt rahete logon ko ilaaj mil sake
 
 
 But at the same time, the other difficulty is whether after knowing about the disease, they will raise their hands towards the right help, or they will silently choose the wrong path for fear of society
 
 
 tippaniyan a plea can also be given that everything should be a choice
 
 
 agar hamaare desh main duniya ke kai viksit deshon ke mukaable, jivan ke har pahalu main chunane kaa haq he, to phir yahaan kyon nahin
 
 
 Every person has the right to choose whether he wants a test at home or not
 
 
 jise nahin karnaa, vah kit na kharide
 
 
 Well, the arguments are many
 
 
 philhal yah test america main hi viksit hua he, or NACO ne pehle hi ise bharat laane se manaa kar diya he
 
 
 But i raise the question without any bias - is this decision right? 
 
 ? Then i thought that this man must have had some compulsions - financial constraints, social exclusion, depression or self-guilt - but the question arises, why did this man ruin the rest of his wife's life
 
 
 use besahaara to chhod hi gaya, jo beemaari shaayad usne khud hi apni patni ko di ho, vah saare samaaj ko bataa bhi gaya
 
 
 Now what choice does that woman have left
 
 
 aise main is tarah ke peedit koi galat kadam na uthaa len, uske liye neshnal aids control organizeshan (NACO) kaa suzav he - counselling
 
 
 My question is that if a person finds himself suffering from AIDS in his home without any counseling support, will his mental condition be such that he can understand his condition and think something for his future
 
 
 main kisi bhi test ke khilaaf yaa paksh main raay nahin dena chaahati, lekin donon tarah ke sawaal khadey karnaa chaahati hum
 
 
 Probably a test done in the privacy of the house will allow more people to get their tests done for this disease than now, and people can get treatment in time
 
 
 lekin vahiin duusari mushkil yah he ki kya rog ke bare main jaanane ke baad ve log sahi madad kii taraf haath badhayenge, yaa samaaj ke dar se chupchaap koi galat raah chun lenge
 
 
 The comments ek daleel yah bhi di ja sakati he ki har chiz kii chwis honi chahie
 
 
 If our country has the right to choose in every aspect of life, than many developed countries of the world, then why not here
 
 
 har insaan ko chunane kaa haq ho ki vah ghar par test chahta he yaa nahin
 
 
 Those who do not, do not buy the kit
 
 
 khayr, daleelein bahut hai
 
 
 The test is currently developed in the US, and NACO has already refused to bring it to India
 
 
 lekin main bina kisi pakshpaat ke sawaal uthaati hum - kya yah faisla sahi he

 To die in your own footsteps, live your own life, your love is like the river, and in my eyes all the people are equal, for me, Kashi is the same, Madina Bhitori's eyes are not aware of it, maybe it is broken like a heart is like a pain And i am the one who says 'toor'! What is my life too? 3
 From the journey of a journey, like a fellow, Gayaasaya came out of the body of the body, he died, which dream came true, the moon came to my house this evening; The impression is that every lion of his rabbit has gone to the bottom of my thoughts
 Just say that i live a dead body if i realized that i had died, but this desire-e-badan did not make it anywhere
 i went wherever i went with

 a day after Pakistani security forces liberated an american-canadian couple from the Haqqani terrorist network, US President Donald Trump said he had begun to develop a better relationship with Pakistan
 gauratlab he ki america naagarik katalan colman or unke canadai pati joshua boil ko unke teen bacchon ke saath hakkaani network se guuruuvaar ko pakistani suraksha balon ne surakshit bachaakar baahar nikaala
 The operation was carried out by Pakistani security forces based on intelligence received from US authorities

 Trump's remarks came during the announcement of the Afghan and South Asia policy in August

 In the meeting of the state secretary of state of the CPM, state secretary Hiralal Yadav expressed concern that the communal elements are committing violent incidents by trivializing common things on minor incidents

 On the other hand, among the minorities, people like Haji Yakub Qureshi of Meerut want to increase their popularity by making rhetoric about the killing of journalists in Paris
 yadav ne logon se sampradayik takaton ke bahekaave main na aane kii apil karte hue rajya sarkaar se aise sampradayik tatwon va takaton ke khilaaf sakht karrwai karne kii guzarish kii
 --- input from IANS shimla,himachalapradesh ke mukhyamantri jairam thakur nepanch maheene se bhi kam arse main jis tarah se mukhyamantri karyaalay kii afasarshahi samet lagbhag puri team ko phenta he usase saaf he ki thakur ko nattejey dharaatal par chahie
 But before doing so, he returned to meet not only Prime Minister Narendra Modi but party president Amit Shah, but has also come to his full form taking other senior judges of the party into confidence
 bhaajapa sarkaar, party ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon kii ore badhaate hue aisa kar dikhaanaa chaahati he jisase aage bhi camel kaa jalawaa barkaraar rahe
 Therefore, the Chief Minister himself prepared the blueprint for setting up an agile, prompt and honest team of officers
 ek-do afasaron ke naaj nakhre chhod den to baakiyon ke maamle main mukhyamantri ne kade faisle lekar sidhaa sandesh diya he ki koi laag lapet nahin balki 'rigelt' dene honge
 Not only the performance of the Lok Sabha, but during his five-year tenure, the team of officers has been kept with him for 16 hours in order to get a unique image in the hearts of the people
 jairam ne ek darjan se zyada logon ke vibhaagon main pherbadal kiye
 But first cleaning was done in his office

 But ACS Srikanth Baldi, who had been in finance for more than a decade, was made Principal Secretary but did not give any other department like Manisha
 swabhaav se vinamr jairam ne kuch afasaron ke naaz nakhre uthaakar behtareen vibhaag die, jisase unki karypranali main 'sakhti' shabd pighalta sa dikhaa
 Personal, Home Department comprise and also changed departments
 tisipi, peedblyoody, rajasav, krishi jaise vibhaagon main bhi puri tarah se pherbadal kiye gaye
 According to sources, Jayaram has considered two reasons for the lethality happening in everyday files
 pehla to afasaron ke tark-kutark
 Second, the officers' own implications
 inhen vajahon se faislon main deree ho rahi thi
 Jayaram had been seeking change for almost a month and a half but only after examining all the feedback and bureaucracy closely, the Chief Minister tested non-performers in tough decisions
 mahatvapurn yah bhi rahaa ki unhone is maamle main rajyapal ko bhi vishwaas main liya
 His recommendations were also included
 vartmaan sarkaar paryaton or paryaavaran do kshetron main kaaphi kuch karnaa chaahati he
 But the constant pressure of the decisions of the NGT is keeping the government under control
 dekhnaa yah he ki adaalat va engiti ke farmaanon se nikalakar jairam team kaise aage badhati he
 However, after the bureau cratic reshuffle, the Chief Minister has also clamped down on the police
 baithak main saaf kaha ki mafia par nakel daalo varanaa sarak lo
 Maintaining his honest image, the Chief Minister is expecting the same from the officers
 mukhyamantri jairam thakur kaa kahana he ki behatar karypranali ke liye yah arrangement kiya he
 Further transfers can also be made
 unhone kaha ki jahaan jaruri hoga vahaan kade faisle liye ja sakate hai

 Production and sales of this popular budget hatchback will be discontinued from April 2020
 reports ke mutabik company ab is car par or invest karne ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Let me tell you that at one time this budget car was Ratan Tata's dream car

 However, Tata Motors has no plans to update the Nano engine to the mandatory BS-VI emission norms from April 2020
 ye jaankaree tata motors ke paisanger whical bijness unit ke president mayank pari dwaara saajha kii gai he
 Mayank said in his statement that, Nano is produced in our Gujarat based Sanand plant
 janvari main nae sefti norms aae hai
 Some more new norms will come in April and then some new safety norms will come again in October
 iske baad 1 april 2020 se BS-VI emishan norms anivart rup se lagu kar diya jayega
 In such a situation, all the products cannot be updated in BS-VI emission norms and we cannot invest to upgrade all the products
 naino inhen main se ek he
 Some time back there were also reports that the car is being discontinued due to low cell of Tata Nano
 haalanki car tab bhi icchhuk graahakon ko order-tu-order basis par uplabdh karaayaa ja rahaa tha
 The company gave its best to continue the production for a long time due to the emotional connection to the project in the initial stages
 haalanki janvari 2008 main tata naino kii lonching ke ek dashak baad ab is car ke production ko aakhirkaar band kiya ja rahaa he
 Tata Motors said that it is quite challenging for auto companies to update all the existing products to BS-VI
 mayank pari ne aage kaha ki, philhal hamaare paas 5 yaa 6 products unhen ham apadet karenge
 This is a big challenge for the industry
 BS-IV stock ko 1 april 2020 tak khatm kar diya jayega

 The final results of the counting of votes in the Osmanabad Lok Sabha seat of Maharashtra have come on Thursday
 shivasena ne apni seat par kabja barkaraar rakhaa he
 Party candidate Om Prakash Bhupal Singh alias Pawan Rajenibankar recorded a resounding victory here

 kin ummidavaaron kii kismat daanv paramaharashtra kii osmanabad sansadeey seat se is baar kul 14 pratyaashee chunaav lard rahe hai
 From here, Shiv Sena nominated Omroz Nimbalkar as its candidate, while the National Congress Party gave Ranjgit Singh Padmasinh Patil, Bahujan Samaj Party Shivaji Pandharinath Oman and the deprived Bahujan Aghadi the Arjuna elections
 osmanabad loksabhaa seat se 7 nirdaleey pratyaashee bhi chunavi maidan main hai
 Who was the last time Ravindra Gaikwad of Shiv Sena is the sitting MP from Osmanabad Lok Sabha seat of Bajima Maharashtra

 Then Ravindra Gaikwad got 6 lakh 07 thousand 699 votes, while Padmasinh Bajirao Patil had to be satisfied with 3 lakh 73 thousand 374 votes

 Four months later, the woman accused the CJI of indecent conduct with her
 iske liye usne kisi jagah pehle koi shikaayat nahin kii
 The news of this incident came on four websites on 19 April
 haalanki isamen sijei kaa paksh nahin tha
 Not only this, the complainant also sent copies of the affidavit to 22 judges of the Supreme Court
 maamla saamne aane par sijei ne apane khilaaf jaanch cameti gathit kar di
 Meanwhile, a lawyer named Utsav Bains made some sensational revelations related to the case in the Supreme Court that the lobby of big corporates is working behind it to pressure the judiciary
 court ne uski bhi baat suni
 While forming the committee, the CJI had said that the judiciary is in danger and it is being targeted

 The aggrieved women committee refused to appear before the committee, with the plea that she did not expect justice

 a three-member crew of two female and one male judges gave the CJI a clean chit in the case

 abhi chunki chunavi maahaul he or sarkaar bhi is maamle main apni taraf se koi pahal karne se batch rahi he isliye maamla thanda he
 But it is certain that the head of allegations on CJI is linked to only one woman
 jis tarah se shikaayat kii drofting hui or jis sangyojan ke saath maamla saamne laayaa gaya wo bataata he ki maamla mahila ko nyaay se bhi bada he
 Some simple questions will arise in your mind that can there be an FIR against a judge of Supreme Court or High Court? Can they be arrested? No, there can be no FIR nor arrest because the Supreme Court has set such guidelines that before such action against Supreme Court and High Court Judges, the Government will have to consult the Chief Justice of India and based on the concrete material evidence Further action will be taken

 punjab ke lokapriy singer satinder sartaaj or ginni maahi ne us samay shrotaaon ko apni aawaaj se mantrmugdh kar diya, jab unhone india today ke state of stats (esoes) conklev kaarykram main apni taan chhedi
 The Punjab edition of SOS was held on Thursday
 is dauraan antim seshan punjab ke mujeec par aadhaarit tha, jiskaa naam tha mujeec maid in punjab
 It includes noted singer, poet, composer Dr
 satinder sartaaj or singer ginni maahi ne shirkat kii
 Satinder said- "I have no musical background, but from the very beginning there was something inside that took me to music
 shairana koi bhi ho saktaa he, lekin ise sambhalakar rakhana badi baat he
 i have represented India in dancing abroad
 teesri class main pehla parformens diya tha
 "on the level of Punjabi song lyrics dropping and criticism of this, Satinder said-" This change will come psychologically, not force
 hamane ek campan chalaaya he seve youth, seve punjab
 You cannot solve this problem of music through singers and politicians
 hamen to bataaya jaataa he ki jisaki maang ho, wo banaaya jayega
 Now it is all over the audience
 "ginni maahi ne kaha- mere kariyar kii bas abhi shuruyaat he
 i keep going towards the floor
 meraa target plabac singer bananaa he
 Ginni further said- i want every song of mine to send a message to the people
 mere gane main ek sachai or maanavtaa honi chahie
 i want to say the words of every religious teacher of the world through my songs
 sandesh yahi he ki puure sansar main ekta honi chahie
 Can't do anything in front of audience demand: Sartajdaw
 satinder sartaaj ne kaha, "kalakaaron ko hameshaa atension kii jarurat hoti hai
 Our approach is that nothing can stop you from saying what you want to say
 duusari baat jo cheez bik rahi he use banane main koi harj nahin he
 If the audience is demanding something, then you cannot do anything in front of that demand
 ab duniya ek global village ban chuki hai
 In such a situation, you cannot stop all the things

 khabaren to yahaan tak ain ki somnath main pichley dinon hui ek meeting main khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ne adwani ke naam ko lekar charchaa kii
 However, all the people present in the meeting are clearly denying this
 8 march ko hui thi somnath trust kii meeting1992 main laalkrishna adwani ne somnath se hi ayodhya yatra kii shuruyaat kii thi or tab unke sarathi modi hi the
 On March 8, the meeting of Somnath Trust took place at Somnath in which Narendra Modi, BJP National President Amit Shah, Somnath Trust President Keshubhai Patel, senior BJP leader LK Advani, former Chief Secretary PK Lahiri and two other members of the committee trust were involved
 kareeb ek ghante tak chali is meeting main somnath mandir ko lekar to charchaa hui or kai ahm faisle liye gaye lekin duusare kisi mudde par baat nahin hui
 In the meeting did not take place on the President's post, Chief Secretary PK Lahiri said that there was no discussion on any other issue except the Somnath Trust's agenda in the meeting
 keshubhai patel ne bhi kaha ki baithak main raashtrapati pad ko lekar koi charchaa nahin hui
 It is also necessary to mention here that Advani reached Somnath just a day before the meeting
 uske baavjood ve na to pradhanmantri ke kaarykram main manch par pahunche or na hi modi, keshubhai or amit shah ke saath somnath mandir main puja ke liye gaye
 The distance between Modi and Advani is no longer a hidden thing
 isliye majboot he adwani kii daavedarilalkrishna adwani party ke sabase senior netaa hai
 If he is made President, then it will be an honor for his seniority, it can be a good decision for Modi and Amit Shah themselves
 darasal modi party main itane bade netaa ho gaye hai ki party ab bijepi ki jagah unke naam se hi jaani jaati he
 In such a situation, other leaders of the party, who are losing Modi's height, keep meeting Advani and complaining about modi-shah
 agar adwani ko raashtrapati banaaya jaataa he to ve in netaaon se dur ho jaaenge jo modi-shah ke liye acchhee baat hogi kyonki sansadeey board kaa sadsy na hone ke baavjood party main unki raay sunani padati he

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national general secretary Varun Gandhi lashed out at the party's Swabhimaan rally held in Bareilly, as well as praised BJP president Rajnath Singh and compared him to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 varun ne kaha ki rajnath singh atalji kii tarah kaam karte hai
 Now, what was Varun's intention behind Rajnath Singh's praise, only to know Varun, but this statement is sure to give air to the fact that Rajnath Singh did not even participate in the race for the post of PM in 2014
 virodhiyon par nishaanaa sadhate hue varun ne kaha ki eemaandaar party or eemaandaar netaa hi uttar pradesh kii tasviir badal saktaa he
 Addressing thousands of supporters at the Grain Mandi Maidan, Varun said, "in Uttar Pradesh, corruption is systematically promoted in Mayawati and Mulayam's reign
 ham log ek yaa do lakh karod rupee ke ghotaale kaa zikr karte hai lekin dhyaan dene laayak baat yah he ki yah mahaj aankade nahin hai
 He said that with these money millions of schools could be opened and lakhs of youth could be provided employment
 gauratlab he ki varun gandhi ko haal main rajnath kii nai team main rashtriya mahasachiv banaaya gaya tha, iske baad se hi aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki bijepi uttar pradesh main varun ko ek majboot hathiyaar ke taur par istemaal karne kaa rodmap taiyaar kar chuki he
 Meanwhile, there is also speculation that Varun Gandhi has made up his mind to contest from Sultanpur parliamentary seat this time
 bareli main is raily ke baad ab varun chaar may ko lakhanu main dharne par baithenge
 Earlier, National President Rajnath Singh on Wednesday hit out at the state government saying that whenever Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) governments are formed in the state, hooliganism increases in Uttar Pradesh
 bareli ke anajmandi maidan main yojit swabhimaan raily main juty hajaaron kii bheed ko sambodhit karte hue bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh ne yah baaten kahin
 Rajnath said that the situation of law in the state has become disastrous

 Rajnath said that SP and BSP are supporting the Center due to fear of Central Bureau of Investigation

 " After a lot of speculation, 70-year-old Bhaiyaji Joshi was unanimously elected Sarkaryavah for the fourth time at the meeting of the RSS House of Representatives on Saturday
 bhaiyaji joshi 2009 se sarkarywah kii jimmedaari nibhaa rahe hai
 3pm on Saturday
 40 baje sarkarywah ke chunaav kii prakriya shuru hui
 Ashok Soni of Central Zone was made the election officer
 pashchim kshetra ke jayanti bhai bhadesiya ne bhaiyaji ke kaarykaal main jo kaam hue uskaa ullekh karte bhaiyaji joshi kaa naam phir se sarkarywah ke liye prastaavit kiya
 After that Jayanthi Bhai Bhadesia's proposal was supported by Virendra Singh Parakramaditya, South Zone Rajendran, Vitthalji and Umesh Chakraborty
 mjedaar baat ye he ki bhaiyaji joshi ke alaava kisi or ummidavaar ne apni daavedaari pesh nahin kii or pratinidhi sabha ne sarvasammati se bhaiyaji joshi ko ek baar phir se 3 saal ke liye sarkarywah ke liye chun liya
 Sarkaryavah is elected at a meeting to be held in Nagpur every three years
 sutron kii maane to sangh ke kuch netaa chaahate the ki is baar sarkarywah bhaiyaji joshi kii jagah sahasarkaarywah datratreya hosbhole ko sarkarywah kii jimmedaari di jaae
 But on the other hand Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat and some senior Sangh officials wanted that Bhaiyaji Joshi should be given the tenure of another Sarkaryavah
 pichhali baar kii hi tarah bhaiyaji joshi ne sarkarywah ke chunaav main bhavuk bhaashan diya or kaha ki do baar se main kah rahaa hum ki mujhe is jimmedaari se mukt kiya jaae or yang blad ko aage laakar jimmedaari di jaye
 Then you guys did not listen to me, but just accept this time
 lekin bhaiyaji joshi ke kehane ke baad bhi pratinidhi sabha ne sarvasammati se unako hi sarkarywah chunaa
 At the 2015 meeting of the House of Representatives, during the election of Sarkaryavah, senior leaders of the Sangh were worried about the health of Bhaiyyaji Joshi, but despite this, he was given the responsibility of Sarkaryavah for the third time
 sutron kii maane to sangh ke kai netaaon kaa maananaa he ki sahasarkaarywah datratreya hosbhole ko sarkarywah kii zimmedaari di to wo waisi hi paristithi paidaa hogi jaisi atal bihari vaajapeyi or laal krishna adwani ke samay main kasee sudarshan sangh pramukh or mohan bhagwat sarkarywah ke rahete samay aayi thi
 Sudarshan was older in rank, but he was less in age and experience
 is baar sangh nahin chahta tha ki dobaaraa aisi samasya khadi ho
 If sources are to be believed, many big leaders of the Sangh were not in favor of making Dattatreya Hosabole as Sarkaryavah because their history has been the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad of the Sangh and the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad was always seen as a political organization in the Sangh
 is
 dattatreya hosbhole kii hi tarah kaa itihaas kabhi sangh ke sah sarkarywah rahe madandas devi kaa bhi rahaa he

 You must have heard the news of fake banknote coming out of atms of a government bank, but you must have heard somewhere that atms of government banks are not only cheating, but also making fun of customers
 uttar pradesh ke bareli main bilkul yahi hua
 On April 22, Sunday, a Hindi newspaper journalist Praveen Uttam was walking out of the ATM at the Subhash Nagar area of bareilly, withdrawing Rs 1,200 from the ATM of the United Bank of India
 ATM se paanch sau rupee ke do note or sau rupee ke do note nikle the
 However, before keeping the withdrawn notes in his pocket, he was surprised when Pravin Uttam caught sight of one of them
 paanch sau rupee ke ek note par ek taraf'bhartiya manoranjan bank of india'or duusari taraf'children bank of india'likhaa tha
 Praveen couldn't believe his eyes and was wondering what to do
 Then another person Ashok Pathak reached the same ATM to withdraw money
 ashok pathak swasthya vibhaag ke ritair karmchaaree hai
 Praveen started waiting outside the ATM that Ashok Pathak should also withdraw money, to find out what this ridiculous joke has only happened to him
 ashok pathak ne ATM se saadhe chaar hajaar rupee nikaale
 Praveen asked him to check his notes properly
 jab ashok pathak ne apane noton ko sahi se dekha to unamem se 500 ke do note bhi thik vaise hi nikle, jisko lekar praveen uttam pareshaan the
 Now these two people together started waiting for the arrival of a third person in the ATM, so that it can be sure that there is something wrong in the five hundred rupee notes coming out of the ATM
 kuch hi der main indra kumaar shukla paise nikaalane usee ATM main pahunche
 Indra Kumar Shukla is himself associated with the banking sector
 in donon logon ne indra kumaar ko bina kuch bataae kaha ki vah rupee nikaalen or mobile par uskaa video banane lage
 Both people felt that if the video of the Indian Entertainment Bank note coming out of the ATM becomes a video, then it will be a sure proof
 in donon logon kii yojana kaam ai
 The entire video was shot on mobile, taking out 1000 from Indra Kumar Shukla's ATM
 is baar bhi 500 rupee ke do note nikle the, jinamein se ek note nakli tha, jis par rigerv bank of india kii jagah bhartiya manoranjan bank chapa hua tha
 These three people thought that now with full evidence, this matter should be told to the manager of the bank
 nakli noton ko dekhakar bank manager bhi hairanbareli main united bank of india ke manager bachchan saaha ko jab in teenon logon ne apni dastaan sunai, to wo bhi hairaan rah gaye
 But fake notes emanating from atms were also revealed, not one but three people were testifying to this
 is puure vaakye kaa video shoot bhi pakke saboot ke taur par saamne tha
 Because of this, it was not possible to refuse
 bank manager ne in teenon logon se likhit shikaayat darj karaane ko kaha
 On this, these three people got their complaint status
 dekhte hi dekhte yah khabar chaaron taraf fail gai or kai TV channel or akhabaaron main united bank of india ke atm se bhartiya manoranjan bank ke note nikalne kii khabar charchaa main aa gai
 Aajtak / India Today investigated the matter of fake currency news so that the truth could be revealed
 bank ke manager or karmchaariyon se baatcheet karke pataa chalaa ki bareli shahar main united bank of india ke teen ATM hai
 The filling of notes in these three atms is not done by the bank, but by an outside agency, named Securitrans India Pvt Ltd
 yah company city bank, standard chartered bank, american express bank, HDFC, kenra bank, isiaisiai bank ke atm ko bhi manage karne kaa kaam karti he
 The company was acquired in 2011 by CMS Infosystems Limited
 bareli united bank of india ke manager bachchan saaha ne bataaya ki bank or is agency ke bich email ke jariye samvaad hota he
 The bank calculates the amount of money required in the ATM and hands it over to the man of this agency and then it is his responsibility to go to the ATM and fill the money
 ek baar main atm main adhik se adhik 20 lakh rupee daale jate hai
 Bareilly atms from Bareilly were filled with money last time on April 19
 us dinashechuritrans indiaki taraf se rahul mishra naam ke agent ne bank aakar chah lakh liye the
 The cashier of the bank, Aniket Babu, gave this six lakh rupees to Rahul Mishra
 isamen 2000 rupee ke 100 note or 500 rupee ke 800 note shaamil the
 Both the bank's manager and the cashier said that when the notes are given to the agent of the ATM filling agency, it is thoroughly investigated and counted
 agent bhi apane saamne noton kii ginati karwaata he or ATM main bharne se pehle mashin se is baat kii jaanch kii hoti he ki sabhi note thik hai or isamen koi nakli note nahin he
 If there is a single fake note in the pack of notes, the machine will immediately catch it
 bank ke is daawey kii jaanch karne ke liye jab ajtak ke samvaadadaata ne noton kii gaddi main do nakli note daalkar use mashin main test kiya, to har baar mashin ne nakli note ko pakad liya
 The same fake note was used for the test, which Praveen Uttam and Indra Kumar Shukla got from the ATM and has been deposited in the bank
 ATM main paisa bharne vaali agency se nahin mila javablekin iske baad jab Securitrans India se sampark karne kii koshish kii gai to kai baar koshish ke baavjood koi saamne nahin aayaa
 When the manager of the bank himself wanted to call Rahul Mishra, who took the note from the bank on April 19, no one came forward
 Securitrans India ke phone number par koi jawaab nahin mila
 Perhaps the agency people were avoiding coming to the fore after the case came to the headlines
 hairaani kii baat ye he bank se hasil Securitrans India Pvt Ltd
 The wrong phone number is also printed on the letter pad
 chapa hua number 936853488 he jisamen sirf 9 disit hai jabaki har mobile number main 10 disit hote hai
 When we contacted the head office of United Bank of India in Kolkata about the fake note coming out from the bank's ATM, we sent our reply to the bank's email on this matter
 united bank of india ke dipti general manager manish agarwal ke mutabik bank ATM main daalane ke liye jo note detaa he uski acchhee tarah se jaanch kii jaati he
 He also said that after the complaint of these three people, when all the remaining notes were checked from the same ATM, then no more notes came out of them
 unhone kaha ki iske baavjood in graahakon ke shikaayat ke baad bank is len dein ke bare main puri jaanch karegaa
 After investigating this entire matter, it can be said that neither these three customers are lying nor they would have given fake notes to be put in atms in the bank
 is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki noton main gadabad bank se ATM pahunchane ke bich hui he jisaki jimmedaari ATM main note baantne vaale agency kii hoti he
 That is, the news of fake banknote coming out of Bareilly from United Bank of India's ATM is correct
 (bareli main krishna gopal or arvind mishra ke inputs ke saath) The trend of taking many health insurance policies together is increasing
 vahiin, rakam kaa daawa karte vakt kai sawaal or shaq-shubahe bhi khadey kiye ja rahe hai
 Follow the guidelines below and there will be nothing wrong with you
 bahut-si policiyaan kyohindustan main ilaaj karwaane kaa kharch lagaataar badhata hi ja rahaa he or ek swasthya beemaa yojana ke tahat diya gaya kawarej puure kharchon ke liye kaaphi nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 Advisers say that in a major medical emergency, additional health insurance plans can be a good support
 aisa isliye he kyonki agar ek bimakarta daawey ko khaarij kar detaa he, to ho saktaa he ki doosraa bimakarta usee daawey ko sweekaar kar le
 Therefore, buying more than one health insurance policies serves as a protection against claims being rejected
 bahut-si policiyon se daawa kaise karengar aapke paas ek se zyada policiyaan hai (maan len ki unamem se sabhi kshatipurti-aadhaarit beemaa policiyaan hai) or daawa kii gai rakam tamaam policiyon ke tahat bimit rakam se kam he, to aap apana daawa pesh karne ke liye kisi bhi bimakarta company ko chun sakate hai
 If the claim amount is higher than the sum insured under a policy after considering deductions and / or co-pay clause, you can still choose which insurer to claim first
 haalanki bimakarta daawey kaa nipataara anshdaan kii dhara ko lagu karne ke baad karegaa—daawey kaa nipataara bimit rakam ke anupaat main kiya jayega
 For example, one may have a policy of Rs 2 lakh from insurer a and another 1 lakh from insurer B
 kii policy kharidi he, to bimakarta e or bi iskaa nipataara kramshah do-tihaai or ek-tihaai ke anupaat main karenge
 Claims of any amount which an insurer does not pay due to the restrictions of the policy can be paid under other policies
 lekin policydharak ilaaj par kharch kii gai rakam se zyada kisi bhi haal main praapt nahin kar saktaa
 When making a claim from another insurer, the policy holder first needs to present the original copies of the documents along with the original letter of settlement from the insurer
 swasthya beemaa policy kharidte vakt un tamaam swasthya beemaa yojanaon kaa khulaasa karnaa jaruri he jo aapane kharid rakhi hai
 This is also necessary when you make a claim
 in byoron ko chhipaana swasthya beemaa yojana ke niyamon or sharton ke ulanghan ke baraabar ho saktaa he or jaanch-padtaal hone par ise galatabayani qaraar diya ja saktaa he
 Know the details: If you have purchased more than one health insurance policy, then read and know the terms and conditions of each policy thoroughly
 pataa kar len ki kawarej kii seemaa kya he or daawey ke nibatare ke liye harek policy ke liye kya karnaa or kya nahin karnaa he
 Which policy you choose first to claim should be based on the length of time after purchasing insurance, coverage of pre-existing diseases, maximum coverage, no-claim bonus and rebate, if any

 kohli ne ravivaar ko westeindies ke khilaaf khele gaye duusare vanade match main shatak jamaaya tha jo unke vanade kariyar kaa 42waan shatak tha

 In this innings, Kohli also surpassed former India captain Sourav Ganguly
 vah vanade main ab bharat ke liye sabase zyada ran banane vaale duusare ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 Ganguly scored 11,221 runs in 297 innings in odis, while Kohli surpassed him in 229 innings
 28 oktober ko relies hone ja rahi karan johar kii film 'i dil he mushkil' relies ko lekar pehle se hi kai pareshaaniyon main ghiri thi ki ab iske raste main ek or badi aadchan aa gai he
 The latest update in this case is that 'cinema Honors and Exhibitors Association of India' is not in favor of releasing this film
 is association ke president nitin daataar ne haal hi main is baat kii ghoshnaa he ki vah karan johar kifilm 'i dil he mashkil'ko relies karne ke paksh main nahin hai
 The main reason for his move is being said to be the cameo of Pakistani actor Fawad Khan in the film
 association ne kaha he ki unhone yah faisla suraksha kaarnon ko dekhte hue liya he
 He says that given the current situation, the release of any artist artist of Pakistan can prove to be a big threat at this time and they do not want to take this risk
 aapako bataa den ki 'cinema onors or aggibitars association of india' se jyaatar single screen ke onors jude hue hai, aise main film kaa single screen theatres par relies hona mushkil main najar aa rahaa he
 Even Nitin Datar said, 'the association wants the boards of other states to also support our decision not to release the film and not allow it to be released
 ' iske alaava is association ke saath keval maharashtra ke hi 430 members jude hue hai
 The association claims that they have considerable dominance in Goa, Gujarat and parts of Kolkata and are associated with single-screen owners as well as many small multiplexes
 association ke film ko relies naa karne ke is faisle ko lekar BJP saansad, actor or singer manoj tiwari ne saraahna kii he
 Manoj Tiwari gave a statement about this, saying, i am very happy with this move by distributors
 main iske liye IMPA indian film or televijan diarectors association kaa bhi dhanyavad karnaa hum
 'manoj Tiwari said that this decision of the association will boost the morale of the soldiers
 manoj kaa kahana he ki jab tak kalakaar aatankwaadiyon or unka poshan karanevaalon kii ninda nahin karte hai tab tak aisi pabandi honi jaruri he
 However, despite all these speculations about the release of the film, on Thursday, the censor board gave the film a UA certificate

 Roman Catholic cardinals from around the world will attend a conference starting in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel from Tuesday so that Benedict can elect a new pope after the historic resignation of the 16th
 greenvich samyaanusaar 15 bajkar 45 minute par sabhi cardinal gopneeyata kii shapath lenge or iske saath hi duniya bhar ke 1
 The centuries-old custom of choosing a new leader for 2 billion Catholics will begin
 punarjagran pratikon or niyamon ke anusaar sammelan ke dauraan cardinalon kaa bahari duniya se koi sampark nahin rahata he
 The challenge for the cardinals will be to elect the 266th Pope who can resolve issues related to the Church
 cardinalon ne aise shashakt vyaktitv par jor diya he, jo carch kii kendriya sarkaar ‘roman curia’ main badlaav laa saken or padariyon par yon-shoshan ke lage aaropon tathaa use dabaae jane jaise muddon se nipat saken
 The demand for transparency got a boost last year when Benoqid's assistant Paolo Gabriel leaked hundreds of confidential documents
 isse curia ke andar chal rahe sangharsh kaa khulaasa hua tha or gabril ke is kadam ko ‘vatiliks’ naam diya gaya tha
 The next Pope's agenda will include the tradition of celibacy of priests and issues like artificial contraception and relations between members of the same sex
 vatican ke anbhavi paryvekshakon kaa maananaa he ki ab bhi maidan khulaa hua he
 The author of Benedict's biography and Italian expert on Vatican affairs, Marco Politi, says no name has emerged as a strong candidate so far
 puri main jagannatha mandir ke garbh grih main pravesh or nikaas daravaajon ke paas marijon ko le jane vaale strechar rakhe dekhakar achraj hona lajimi he
 But if you spend some time in the temple courtyard on a crowded day, then you will see their use
 shor-sharabe ke bich aapako kuch sevadaar mandir ke bheetar se kisi behosh bhakt ko in par laate dikhenge
 Here it is common to have huge crowds and suffocation in the dark in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple
 bheed-bhaad ke dinon main roj aisi chaar-paanch ghatnaayen hoti hai
 If the campaign to make the Jagannath temple safe and convenient for the devotees is carried out, will the same emotional tide rise in support of it that is boiled in the campaign to build another temple? Why should the Jagannath temple itself, save any old pilgrimage or heritage of the country -do not see the madness of building a political statue in the decoration? We are looking for new temples on the politics of new heritage e are dying and the dead buried, crushed in a crowd of old temples
 bharat kii puraatan samskruti kii upeksha par fat padane vaala bhartiya dakshinpanth bhi viraasaton ke durdin dur nahin kar sakaa, balki usne kuch ulataa hi kar diya
 In January this year, the Lok Sabha amended the ancient monument, the Archaeological Heritage Law, to remove the condition of not building 100 meters near the ancient monuments
 baavjood iske ki 2016 main sarkaar ne loksabhaa ko bataaya tha ki puraatatv surveykshan ke sangrakshan ke tahat aane vaale 24 smarak gaayab ho gaye hai
 These include temples and stone inscriptions
 kanoon badalane ke baad smarakon ko dhahaane kii chhot-si mil gai he
 Do not know, how many generations will be able to see the picture of heritages
 haal main hi bangaluru main do viraasaten (marafi toun librari or krambigel haul) ko dhahaae jane ke baad swayamsevi sanstha intake ne 83 saal puraane janata bazaar ko bachaane ke liye kanoonee ladaai shuru kii he
 All our old pilgrimage-temples are a place of chaos
 kuch ek aadhunik mandiron ko chhod adhikansh mandir nagaron ke bich yaa phir durgam sthalon par hai or haadason kii baat johte hai
 Most of the temples in India are unprecedentedly rich
 unki sampannataa unke bhakton se badi he
 They have a thriving economy around them
 sarkaar unke chadhaave main mili sone se apni gold diposit skim ko safal bana leti he lekin in mandiron kaa paisa inke bhakton kii aasthaa ko surakshit karne ke kaam nahin aata
 In this country, policies and arrangements could not be made for the management of ancient established and worshiped temples
 nae mandir banane ke liye sansad ko hilaane kii taiyaari aae din hoti he
 We can tell that stopping women in temples is an attack on faith, we do not feel sorry for the devotees who die from the chaos of the temple
 digital india vaala desh bharat ke pracheen sahitya ko aadhunik dhang se anudit, sangrakshit or uplabdh nahin kara paata
 But the latest floods in Kerala swallow up dozens of old book books and monuments
 is baadh ke baad dilli ko pataa chalaa ki hamaari aapadaa prabandhan niti main viraasaton ko prakritik aapadaa se bachaane kii vyavastha hi nahin he
 The legacy of flood-hit Kerala is awaiting voluntary organizations
 kahaan hai shabarimala main adaalat ke aadesh par basen foonkane kaa elaan karne vaale dharm yoddha?garv karte rahiye ki hamaare paas duniya ke sabase puraane mandir hai, un mandiron ke paas akut khajaana he
 Or we have the world's highest heritage but in 71 years only 15,000 monuments have got legal protection while in Britain they number 60,000, which is almost equal to the area of uttar Pradesh
 centre sarkaar ke bajet se salanaa ek fisadi se bhi kam hissaa samskruti mantralay ko miltaa he
 Neither our beliefs are safe, nor are the legacies safe because our leaders neither want to make old temples worthy of worship with peace and convenience, nor to cherish the glories of the past
 aisa karne se itihaas par garv hoga
 Politics has to create the legacies on which we can always fight
 bharat kii raajnneeti hi uski viraasat ke liye sabase bada abhishaap he
 *** upi sarkaar main mantri shivpal yadav ke jameen par avaidh kabze vaale bayaan par bijepi ne nishaanaa sadhate hue ise mahaj ek naatak qaraar diya he
 BJP says that such a statement is going to promote such elements who are occupying the lands of common people
 sarkaar ke bachaav kaa naatakabijeypi kaa kahana he ki mulaayam singh yadav bhi pehle is tarah ke bayaan de chuke hai
 UP BJP President Keshav Prasad Maurya says that such statement confirms the corruption of ministers of the SP government
 maury ne kaha ki is tarah kaa bayaan dena sarkaar kaa bachaav karne kaa ek nayaa naatak he
 Keshav said that Mulayam Singh Yadav is cheating on the people of the state in his son Moh
 siem nahin kar paa rahe hai karrwaikeshav prasad maury ne sienkhileshyadav par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki kabja karne waalon ke khilaaf mukhyamantri ji karrwai nahin kar paa rahe hai
 He has done the work of reducing the dignity of the Chief Minister's post
 uttar pradesh main kanoon todane vaale mukhyamantri se zyada taqatvar ho gayi he
 So the Chief Minister should leave the chair immediately

 beete kuch hafton se aseem or siddharth kisi naa kisi baat ko lekar ek duusare se bhidate hue najar aa rahe hai
 Each time after fighting, the two make friendship, but the crack in friendship still appears between them
 yahi vajah he ki dosti karne ke kuch samay baad hi donon ke bich phir ladaai ho jaati he
 Why did aseem-siddharth fight? In the last episode, Siddharth Shukla used his power to secure Mahira Sharma and nominated Aseem to be homeless
 nomination kii prakriya ke baad ab ghar main contestants ke bich nae captain banane kii jang chhid gai he
 During the Captaincy Task, Siddharsh Shukla and Aseem Riyaz will once again clash with each other and tell each other a good deal
 View this post on instagrama post shared by BIGG BOSS (@biggbossofficial13_)ondec 3, 2019 at 10:36am pstsosala media par viral ho rahe sho ke promo main aap dekh sakate hai ki big bos kinhin aise 2 contestants ke naam lene ke liye kahenge jo captain banane ke laayak nahin hai
 For this, most householders will name Siddharth Shukla
 unke mutabik siddharsh shukla captency kii jimmedaariyon ko sahi tareeke se nibhaa nahin paae hai
 During this time there is a lot of debate between Siddharth and Vishal
 iske baad captency task mensiddharthashukla or paras chhabda apane group ke saath captency task jeetne kii stretiji banaate hai, kyonki wo log kisi bhi haalat main apni apojit team ke kisi bhi member ko captain banate nahin dekhnaa chaahate hai
 All the contestants perform the task with great vigor to win the captivity task
 is dauraan siddharth or aseem riyaj ke bich ladaai ho jaati he
 Siddharth is also seen pushing Aseem
 iske baad donon jamkar ek duusare ko khari khoti sunaate hai
 Now it will be interesting to see who wins the captaincy task this time and becomes the new captain of the house
 loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko mili karaari haar ke baad party ke bheetar vivaad thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 Following the defeat, questions were raised on the qualifications of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi
 ab party ke bheetar 'communication gap' kii sthiti paidaa ho gai he
 The latest controversy is related to a meeting of the party in which a major case of communication gap was revealed
 is baithak main na to party adhyaksh sonia gandhi shaamil huin, na hi upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi
 Actually, the Parliamentary Affairs Committee of the Congress was to meet today
 baithak main shirkat karne ke liye sonia gandhi ko subah saadhe nau baje kaa vakt diya gaya tha jabaki baaki sadasyon ko 10 baje kaa samay diya gaya tha
 But, Sonia Gandhi was to go to Rashtrapati Bhavan at 10 pm and this was her pre-scheduled event
 isliye wo baithak kii adhyakshata nahin kar pain
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi is on a tour of Amethi
 isliye wo bhi is baithak main shaamil nahin ho paae
 Questions arise whether the leaders of the party are not aware of the programs of Sonia and Rahul and how any meeting can be organized without them? samaajawaadee party (sapa) kii sarkaar main police bhartee ghotaale kaa jinn kya ek baar phir baahar nikal aayaa he? 'uttar pradesh police bhartee evam pronnati board' kaa taur-tarika to isi ore ishaara kar rahaa he
 Just watch: On 16 March the board announced the result of the recruitment
 isamen ajay kumaar singh yadav, (role number: 412010691) ko obisi shrenee kaa hone ke baavjood 313
 Selected in general category with 4167 marks shown

 Till now only OBC category candidate Ajay Kumar Singh has been described by the board as the beneficiary of horizontal reservation under 'dependent of freedom fighter fighter' (DFF)
 (india today ke paas donon nateezon ke screen shot maujuud hai) sawaal uthta he ki agar obisi abhyarthi ajay kumaar singh yadav swatantraaa sangram shrenee main chaynit hue the to board ne puri jaankaree 16 march ko hi kyon nahin di?daroga bhartee kaa nateeja ghoshit karne ke do din baad 19 march ko board ne sipaahi or samakaksh bhartee main medical ke liye chaynit abhyarthiyon kii soochna achaanak apni website par daal di

 Suddenly there was an uproar and arson and protests began across the state
 do din baad 22 march ko board ne phir apane nateezon main sanshodhan kiya
 It was now reported that the previously announced cutoff marks 182
 5526 un saamaanya mahila abhyarthiyon ke liye he, jo homeguard shrenee ke kshaitij aarakshan ke antargat aati hai
 Now the new cutoff 288 for other general women candidates

 Kumari Baby (roll number: 3231751) from Etah claims that she had scored 80 out of 100 in the race and 179 in the written examination

 Another candidate, Mamta Verma of Gonda, says, "the board has not declared the race and free exam marks on its website
 isse bade paimaane par herpher kii ashanka he
 Thousands of candidates like Kumari Baby have lagged behind despite getting more marks than the cutoff

 The dissatisfaction among the candidates erupted three days after the results of the Daroga recruitment examination were declared on March 16, with the results of the candidates selected for medical examination in the constable recruitment examination
 abhyarthiyon ne puure pradesh main hinsak pradarshan shuru kar die (dekhen box)
 The recruitment of 20,000 soldiers during Mulayam Singh Yadav's previous tenure was mired in scandal allegations and controversies after the BSP came to power in 2007
 ab ek baar phir sapa sarkaar ke daaman par vivaadon ke daag gahraane lage hai
 Continuously Changed Rules On July 15, 2011, the then BSP government started the recruitment process for a total of 41,610 posts of Police Constable (constable) and Territorial Armed Constabulary (PAC)
 thik aath maheene baad march, 2012 main sapa ke sattarudh hote hi is bhartee prakriya ko radd kar 2013 se nae sire se yah kavayad shuru hui
 The merit was made on the basis of verification of the records of the candidates and the marks of the written test after the medical examination in the police recruitment held during the BSP government, but Akhilesh Sarkar kept the preliminary written test first
 iske baad mukhya pariksha hui
 Medical and records were examined at the earliest
 mahila or purush abhyarthiyon ke daud ke maanak bhi badale gaye
 The preliminary examination of the first constable recruitment was proposed on October 27, 2013, but suddenly the date of the examination was extended by two months after the truck carrying the question paper crashed four days ago
 hardoi ke ek abhyarthi pratik dikshit kehete hai, ''board ne isaki koi jaankaree nahin di ki trek kahaan durghatnagrast hua tha or is maamle main kya kahin koi mukadmaa bhi darj hua tha? isi se andeh uthta he
 In 2011, the BSP government also started the recruitment process for 4,010 officers and platoon commanders of pacs
 sapa sarkaar ne isaki bhi niyamavali badali, par court ke aadesh par puraane niyamon se hi pariksha puri kerani padi

 com / livsvcj6tha post shared by Yuvraj Singh (@yuvisofficial) on Nov 12, 2017 at 7:11 am PST yojana ayog kii jagah ek vaikalpik sanstha banane ke mudde par pradhanmantri ke ghar hui baithak main yun to kai rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ne apane suzav or vichaar rakhe
 But Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi raised a big question through his words
 unhone kaha ki swatantraaa diwas ke avasar par pradhanmantri ke yojana ayog ke astitv par punarvichaar sambandhi bhaashan se aam janata main ye dharna faili he ki sarkaar desh main yojana kii prakriya chhodana chaahati he or vikaas ko bazaari shaktiyon ke or puunjipatiyon ke zimme chhod dena chaahati he
 Addressing the Prime Minister in his speech, Manjhi further said that the way the agenda and format of this meeting has been reported, it appears that you have made up your mind on this subject and the states are here only to seal it
 
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne satta sambhalate hi yah manshaa jataa di thi ki vah yojana ayog ko khatm karnaa chaahate hai or uski jagah ek zyada prabhavi sanstha bananaa chaahate hai
 The government is constantly engaged in this exercise
 isi silsile main aaj desh bhar ke mukhyamantriyon kii baithak lee gai
 After the meeting, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that most of the Chief Ministers are in favor of abolishing the Commission and creating a new institution
 jetali ne pradhanmantri ke hawaale se kaha ki zyaadaatar viksit deshon main sarkaar ke dhaanche se baahar ke think tanks badi bhoomika nibhaate hai
 In fact, the government believes that the Planning Commission has lived its life
 badale vakt main sarkari yojanaon ke alaava nijee companiyon kaa bhi vikaas ke kaam main bada yogadan hota he
 The overall development of the country is not possible without taking them along in planning
 isliye ek aisi sanstha ho jisamen centre or rajya sarkaron ke numaayinde to ho hin, sarkaar se itar mahatvapurn vyaktiyon ko bhi iskaa hissaa banaaya jaae
 It seems that this view of the government is related to the promotion of the Manjhi capitalists and market forces
 haalanki ye bhi ek bada sach he ki 1950 main bana yojana ayog desh ko vikaas ke us mukaam tak le jane main naakaam sabit hua jisaki desh ko zarurat he
 In such a situation, with the new initiative of Modi, many Chief Ministers also see a new light of hope
 baithak main kai rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ne rajya kii zaruuraton ke hisaab se centre ko niti tay karne kii maang kii
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav expressed concern over the diminishing share of the state from the plan budget and demanded that the state get at least 50 per cent of it outright
 vahiin tamilnadu ke mukhyamantri paneerselvam kii taraf se suzav aayaa ki cash sabsidi ko logon ke khate main rajya sarkaron ke zarie hi transfar kiya janaa chahie
 Mamata Banerjee and Omar Abdullah did not reach the meeting for their own reasons
 ye dono chaahe jo sandesh dena chaahate hon lekin haqikat yah he ki sangheey dhaanche ke tahat rajya ko madad ke liye centre ke paas aana hi padataa he
 In such a situation, to decide the responsibility of the Center, they too should have come here and put their point firmly so that tomorrow's complaint does not come

 naam main chaukeedaar lagane kii muhim din main 11 baje se shuru hui
 All except a few senior ministers were engaged within about an hour
 arun jetali or nitin gadakari ne pehle to nahin lagaaya, magar shaam ko chaar baje tak unhone bhi chaukeedaar jod liya tha
 The question arises whether these leaders, who are important in BJP since Vajpayee's time and senior to many ministers of Modi cabinet, do not agree with this watchman campaign or they also add the watchman in front of the name of late
 isko lekar bijepi ke andarkhaane bhi charchaa he

 mukhyamantri ji, yah prakritik aapadaa nahin balki aapaki bhrashtacharik aapadaa he
 Tejashwi said that your corrupt bureaucracy has shown the country by removing your 15-year development from the gutter
 aapke kathith sushasan main jis samay rajendranagar or kankarbagh main naav chal rahi he thik usee samay patna ke duusare hisson main dhul ud rahi he
 If this is a natural disaster, then why did this disaster not happen in the locality in which you live? Is nature a defect? These 6 feet of accumulated dirty water is telling the story of your failure

 ) gujarat main kanoon vyavastha sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaav karwaane ke liye thik nahin he, aisa kehete hue rajya chunaav ayog ne rajya main oktober november main honevaale sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaav teen mahine ke liye taal diye hai
 In Gujarat, elections to 6 municipal corporations including Ahmedabad, Surat, 56 municipalities, 230 taluka panchayats and 31 district panchayats were to be held in october-november
 ab inaki miyaad khatm hone ke baad in sabhi main administrator niyukt karne ke liye karrwai hogi
 The Congress is most disappointed by this decision
 maahaul thik nahin hone ke peeche chunaav ayog kaa ishaara gujarat main pichley do maheene se chal rahe patidaar aarakshan andolan kii ore tha
 The Congress began to feel that if the Patidars, who were called the strong vote banks of the BJP, were upset with the government and if they did not vote for the BJP, then it could directly benefit the Congress
 aise main congress chunaav taalane ko bhaajapa kii chaal bataa rahi he
 It is alleged that the BJP has postponed elections for fear of losing elections
 congress kaa aarope ye bhi he ki agar gujarat ke sthaneey chunaavon main bhaajapa kii haar hoti to uskaa asar sidhaa bihar ke chunaavon par pad saktaa tha isiilie bhaajapa ne chunaav taale hai
 Now, in order to have elections on time, the Congress has decided to knock the door of the Gujarat High Court
 sirf congress hi nahin, bhaajapa kaa virodh kar rahe patidaar andolan se jude netaa bhi is faisle se maayoos hai
 Patidar Reservation Movement leader Hardik Patel gave a message that the government is postponing this election in fear of defeat
 sirf 25 or 26 agast ko hi rajya main hinsa hui thi to kanoon vyavastha kaise bighad gai
 He also said that the BJP is saying that the Patidar votes will not make any difference in the election, then they should get the election done
 tippaniyan But in the meantime BJP has said that Congress has been out of power in the state for the last 25 years, so it is looking forward to come to power
 lekin jis tarah se pichley 25 saalon se congress ko logon ne satta se dur rakhkar bhaajapa kaa saath diya he, vaise hi is baar bhi bhaajapa kaa saath degi
 Elections have been postponed several times during the Congress regime, so it is not right to accuse the BJP
 lekin jaankaar maanate hai ki abhi ke maahaul main agar chunaav hote hai to bhaajapa ko apane sabase vishwast votbank patelon kaa virodh jhelana pad saktaa he or nateezon par iskaa asar bhi pad saktaa he
 If the BJP loses due to any reason, then it can also have an impact on the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, because after all Gujarat is his own home and if the results here are opposite then it will definitely be discussed
 gujarat main ahmedabad, surat samet 6 mahanagarapalika, 56 nagarpalika, 230 taluka panchayat or 31 zila panchayat ke chunaav oktober november main hone the
 Now after their term is over, action will be taken to appoint an administrator in all of them
 is faisle se congress sabase zyada maayoos he
 The Election Commission was pointing to the Patidar Reservation Movement in Gujarat for the last two months
 congress ko ye lagane laga tha ki bhaajapa ke majboot votbank kahe janevaale patidaar agar sarkaar se khafa hai or agar bhaajapa ko vot nahin denge to iskaa phayda sidhaa congress ko ho saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Congress is telling the bjp's move to postpone the election
 uskaa aarope he ki chunaavon main haar ke dar se bhaajapa ne chunaav taale hai
 The Congress also alleges that if the BJP lost the local elections in Gujarat, it could have an impact directly on the Bihar elections, which is why the BJP has deferred elections
 ab samay par chunaav karwaane ke liye congress ne gujarat hoicourt kaa daravaaza khatkhatane kaa faisla kiya he
 Not only the Congress, the leaders associated with the Patidar movement opposing the BJP are also disappointed by this decision
 patidaar aarakshan andolan ke netaa hardik patel ne ek sandesh dekar kaha ki sarkaar haar ke dar se ye chunaav taal rahi he
 If there was violence in the state only on 25 and 26 August, then how did the law and order deteriorate
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki bhaajapa kah rahi he ki patidaar voton se chunaav main koi fark nahin padegaa to wo chunaav karwaakar dekh len
 The comments lekin is bich bhaajapa ne kaha he ki congress pichley 25 saal se rajya main satta se baahar he isliye satta main aane ke liye khwab dekh rahi he
 But the way the people have supported the BJP by keeping the Congress away from power for the last 25 years, similarly this time will also support the BJP
 congress ke shasankaal main bhi kai baar chunaav tale hai, isliye bhaajapa par aarope lagaana thik nahin he
 But experts believe that if elections are held in the present environment, then the BJP may have to face opposition from its most trusted vote bank Patels and it can also have an impact on the results
 agar kisi vajah se bhaajapa haari to iskaa asar pradhanmantri narendra modi ke chhavi par bhi pad saktaa he kyonki aakhir gujarat unka apana griharajya he or agar yahaan nattejey vipareet aate hai to uski charchaa zarur hogi
