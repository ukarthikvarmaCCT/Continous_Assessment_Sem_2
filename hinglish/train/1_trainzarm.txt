 ) The investigation report of the Gomti River Front scheme, which has been conducted by the Yogi government in UP, has not been made public at the moment, but based on this investigation report, a case has been registered against 8 senior engineers of the irrigation department
 do senior iees officer is jaanch ke baad sawaalon ke ghere main hai jin par jaanch samiti ne gambhir sawaal khadey kiye hai
 The Yogi government has made up its mind to give the case to the CBI, so two senior IAS officers associated with the Gomti riverfront have also been facing serious allegations of involvement in the scam
 gomti river front pariyojna kii jaanch report philhal atigopneey he lekin isaki ek copy 'ajtak' ke haath lagi he
 In this investigation report, about a dozen engineers and chief engineers have been accused of serious irregularities, along with senior IAS officers associated with the project, who were of the rank of Chief Secretary
 is report main rajya ke tatkaaleen mukhya sachiv or pramukh sachiv sinchai palaniyamitata ke gambhir aropalage hai
 The investigation committee has found serious financial irregularities in the cost and payment of the project
 report main kaha gaya he ki gomti river front pariyojna ke tender main gambhir aniyamitata barti gai hai
 Also, arbitrary tenders were distributed, black-listed companies have been given major tasks
 jaanch samiti ne gemen india ko kaam die jane par bhi gambhir sawaal uthaae hai
 The investigation committee has written that in West Bengal, Rajasthan and Delhi, this company is black listed, whose information is also available on the Internet, despite this the firm was given such huge contracts
 pariyojna kaa sabase bada kaam diaphram wal kaa kaam tha jiskaa anubandh gemen india limited se hua
 The same firm was also given the huge task of rubber dams and to guarantee unfair benefits, a performance guarantee of more than 100 crores was not taken
 jaanch report main project ke chif ejeeniyar ko pratham drushtya doshi qaraar diya gaya he
 The inquiry committee has written in the report that 29 percent more expenditure has been incurred in the construction of diaphragm wall
 rabar dam main saade 22 pratishat aavanton se zyada vyay hua he
 The floating fountain has cost 585 percent more while the design and drawing of diaphragm wall has cost 264 percent more
 jaanch samiti ne apni report main diverjan of fund ke saath-saath is pariyojna main kisi cher and belens ke nahin hone par bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 Serious questions have also been raised about the Chief Secretary and Principal Secretary of Irrigation in relation to the task force
 The report has written that under the guise of the Chief Minister's dream project and the early completion of the work, the engineers related to this project did some arbitrary work
 report main sabase gambhir sawaal tatkaaleen pramukh sachiv sinchai par uthaae gaye hai or likhaa he ki 20 se 25 baar pramukh sachiv sinchai maukey par kaam dekhne aae chif ejeeniyar sinchai bhi har duusare tisare din maukey par aate the phir bhi chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki aapattijanak vittiya aniyamittaaon kii baat unke sangyaan main kyon nahin ai jo khud vittiya aniyamitata rokane ke liye bane task force ke sadsy bhi the
 This is the reason why in this inquiry report the financial irregularity in the whole project has been termed as 'not salt in lentils but salt in lentils'
 apane nishkarsh main nyaayik jaanch samiti ne likhaa he hai level task force jo kii mukhya sachiv kii adhyakshata main banaai gai thi or jisamen tatkaaleen pramukh sachiv sinchai us samay ke chif ejeeniyar or duusare ejeeniyar the vah sabhi pratham drushtya doshi hai

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator India defeated New Zealand by 18 runs in the first semi-final of the ICC World Cup 2019 on Wednesday
 bharat kii is haar se dilli-ensiaar ke sattabazar ko bada nuksaan hua he
 According to sources, the loss has cost the bookies Rs 100 crore
 is match se pehle sabhi newjiland ke upar bharat kii jeet kii bhavishyavaanee kar rahe the
 India was also believed to be a contender for victory, but the Kiwi team turned the tide
 bharat par satta bazaar main 4
 There was a price of Rs 35, while New Zealand was priced at Rs 49
 iskaa matlab tha ki kiwi team haari hui thi
 In the match when India's score was 200 runs at the loss of six wickets and Ravindra Jadeja and Mahendra Singh Dhoni were batting, the bookies were playing fiercely on India, but in the last two overs, the way New Zealand made a comeback, it all accounted for
 Was spoilt
 dhoni kaa out hona sattebaajon ke liye sabase bura sabit hua, kyonki unka puraa paisa dub gaya tha
 Those who had invested money on New Zealand filled their pockets
 gurugram ke sadar bazaar main sthit ek sattebaaj rajeev singh (farji naam) ne ieenes ko bataaya, 'jab bharat kii sheersh-3 ballebaaj paanch ke kul score par pavilion laut gaye the, tab sattabazar badal rahaa tha
 Our hopes were high yesterday, but with India's defeat today, it proved to be the worst news of the World Cup
 ' unhone bataaya, 'grurugram ke alaava, gajiabad, faridabad or dilli main kai sattebaajon ne paanch sitara hotalon main partiyon kaa intjaam kar rakhaa tha, lekin antim samay main sabhi ko yah radd karnaa padaa
 'kohli's knock on Bokhar, could not get India a big title! a Delhi-based bookie, who was betting on New Zealand, said,' i was quite happy when India's four wickets fell
 main tab bhi kaaphi khush tha, jab bhartiya gendbaaj achche form main nahin the- yah isliye kyonki maine sara paisa newjiland par lagaaya tha
 i took a big risk and it turned out to be a lottery
 'gajiabad kii satta mandi ke ek sattebaaj ne kaha, 'ham aaj buree tarah se haar gaye
 Even in the betting from session to session, we had to suffer a lot, because we had also put money on Dhoni and Jadeja
 ' dilli kaa sattabazar mangalvaar ko kaaphi ooncha gaya tha
 According to police estimates, the betting trade in Delhi NCR went above Rs 150 crore
 satta ranon or wicket se mili jeet ke antar par laga tha
 At the same time, it was also felt that whether India and New Zealand teams together could score more than 400 runs or not
 is baat par bhi paisa laga tha ki koun-sa gendbaaj teen wicket se zyada legaa, aisa koun karegaa, spinner yaa tej gendbaaj
 There was also speculation on who it would be - Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal or Trent Boult and Lockie Ferguson from New Zealand

 For example, 20 rupees on a Bumrah, while seven rupees on a bolt
 bharat ke captain viraat kohli, rohit sharma ke alaava newjiland ke captain ken williamson or martin gaptil par bhi paisa laga tha ki inamen se koun ardhashatak jamaayega or koun shatak
 Recently, the Madras High Court directed the government to ban Tik Tok over content
 hoicourt ke rukh ke baad google ne play store se yuvaaon ke bich lokapriy Tik Tok ap ko hataa diya
 Now actress Kruba Sait who appeared in Sacred Games has supported the ban on the app
 haalanki kubra ke rukh par big bos fame vikaas gupta bhadak gaye or unhone kai twits main apni baat rakhi
 Kruba tweeted about this Tik Tok, "I can't tell how happy i am that Tick Talk has been banned in India
 paagalpan ke halaat ko dekhnaa behad dardabhra tha
 i have never been so happy about a ban
 "I can’t begin to express my joy to hearing about Tik Tok being banned in India
 The state of derangement was exceedingly painful
 i haven’t been happier about a ban
 - Kubbra Sait (@kubbrasait) April 17, 2019 Vikas Gupta was very hurt and responded to Kubra in many tweets
 vikaas gupta ne likhaa, "paagalpan ke halaat ko dekhakar dard hota he jab aapako maansik rup se biimaar logon ke bich rahanaa padataa he
 The talent that some people are showing on Tick Talk and the music app are probably equally talented
 aap jaise artists kii taraf se is bayaan kaa aana behad niraashajanak he
 "state of derangement is extremely painful for the people who have to live in the environment of the mentally ill

 Be it TV or movies or webseries or theater or tick talk
 kuch logon ne tik tok par jo kaam kiya he wo kisi bhi plateform ke liye behtareen content mana ja saktaa he
 "very dissapointing
 Content made on any platform can be good and bad
 Be it Television, Films, Web series or Theater for that matter or Tiktok
 Some of the amazing work done by Individuals on Tiktok can be at par with the so called good work on either of the platforms 😊— Vikas Gupta (@lostboy54)april 18, 2019vikaas ne likhaa, "or aap paagalpan kii baat kar rahe hai, tik tok ke search kollam main family tip kiijie or aapako kareeb 2 billian videos mil jaaengi jahaan parents or bachche saath main acting kar rahe hai or 80 saal ke buudhe khush hokar phani videos par dance kar rahe hai

 "& about the state of derangement, in the search column of # Tiktoktype Family and you might find some 2 billion videos including parents kids acting together to 80 years olds dancing to just plain funny videos
 Yes there are bad content also but that's on TV films and web aswell — Vikas Gupta (@ lostboy54) April 18, 2019 Vikas Gupta wrote, "and finally let's talk about the artists
 tik tok par kai log din raat kaam karte hai taaki apana content bana sake kyonki 15 seconds main behtareen content dena sabase mushkil kaam he
 "& finally coming to the artists working day in and out to create multiple 15 seconder content is one of the toughest things to do

 Apart from this, he also said that many Bollywood stars and the team of film Guliboy have also used Tick Talk to promote their film
 lekin aapane kabhi unhen aisa karne se nahin roka or is bain ke baad kai log profeshnal str par or personal str par prabhavit ho sakate hai
 Kruba was surprised at this developmental reaction and said, "who thought that someone would be so sensitive, hurt and annoyed for a stupid app? How many people waste their time and how many people do this app
" People have ended their lives wandering in the wrong direction
 mujhe tik tok pasand nahin he or mujhe kabhi bhi ye ap pasand nahin tha
 i am happy that this app has been banned
 "arrey! Whoever would’ve imagined so much grave sensitivity & hurt & offence taken & dissatisfaction, towards a silly ass app, that made people waste their time & mislead many to end their lives
 
 
 Yes! stupidly
 i don’t like tiktok, i never have & Yes! I’m happy it got banned
 - Kubbra Sait (@kubbrasait) April 18, 2019 However, Pritish Nandy said in his sensitive tweet that the disadvantage of banning any one thing is that people again start demanding to ban other things as well

 The foundation stone of the historic Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara was laid on Wednesday in Pakistan
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne iskaa shilanyas kiya
 The ceremony witnessed a verbal battle between Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who arrived as a representative of the Government of India and Punjab Government Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and Pakistani speakers over the credit of the corridor
 imran khan ke bulaave par kaarykram main pahunche navjot singh siddhu ne sabase pehle bhaashan diya, jisamen unhone donon mulkon ke bich shanti va aman kaayam karne par jor diya
 Sidhu called the Kartarpur Corridor a major initiative to open the way for dialogue between the two countries
 iske saath hi siddhu ne coridor ke liye apane dost or paak piem imran khan kii tarif main jamkar kaside padhe or coridor ke liye donon sarkaron kaa shukriya adaa kiya
 What Sidhu said Sidhu said, 'much damage has been done
 ab khun kharaba band hona chahie or kisi maa kii god nahin ujadani chahie
 Someone must be pouring water on this fire
 main is coridor ko isi rup main dekhtaa hum
 i am thankful to the Government of India and Imran Saheb who have made this contact again
 jab bhi kartarpur kaa itihaas likhaa jayega, pehle panne par pehla harf aapkaa (imran) naam likhaa jayega
 "miracle happened in three months" Imran Khan took command of Pakistan in August and Navjot Singh Sidhu went to attend his swearing-in ceremony
 vahaan vah paak sena pramukh vajva ke gale mili the
 There was a lot of ruckus in the country on Sidhu's return
 lekin buudhvaar ko coridor ke shilanyas kaarykram main bhaashan dete hue siddhu ye kahana nahin bhuule ki ye chamatkaar hi he, jo 70 saal main nahin ho paaya he, wo teen maheene main ho gaya
 Saying so, Sidhu also said that Imran Khan has kept his word and the Government of India has done it
 harsimrat cor ne kya kahamodi sarkaar main mantri harsimrat cor ne siddhu ke baad apane bhaashan main kaha ki aaj ek aitihaasik din he or sikhon kii saalon kii aradaas puri ho gai he
 He said that this is a very happy occasion for us, because the demand that our party had kept seven months ago has been fulfilled today and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a big gift to the Sikhs by taking this decision
 harsimrat ne kaha ki donon deshon kii kadavaahat mitaane ke liye ye coridor ban rahaa he
 For this i welcome this initiative of you and your government and this is where the hatred between the two countries can be ended
 harsimrat kaa bayaan puraa hote hi kaarykram kaa sanchaalan kar rahe shaks ne turant yah kah diya ki imran khan kii pahal par yah mumkin hua he
 He said, 'wazir-e Azam Imran Khan made an offer to Hindustan, which he accepted
 ' vah ek shaayari ke jariye yah kehete dikhe ki imran khan ne hindustan ko yah ofer kabool karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 In this way, while Pakistan continued to give credit to Imran Khan for the corridor, Navjot Singh Sidhu also appeared to praise him
 haalanki, unhone iske liye donon mulkon kaa hi shukriya adaa kiya
 But when the opportunity came to Harsimrat Kaur, she declared the will and decision of her party and Prime Minister Modi as the biggest reason for this initiative
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bibisi ke ek jarnlist ko uddhrit karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi par shanivaar ko prahaar kiya or daawa kiya ki loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan kiye gaye vaadon ko puraa nahin karne ke kaaran unke samarthakon kii sankhya ghatati ja rahi he
 Responding on behalf of the government after discussing Governor Ramnath Kovind's address to the House of the Bihar Legislature, Nitish said that Lance Price, a British journalist, who was also associated with former Prime Minister Tony Blair and 2014 i wrote a book called 'modi Effect', but now they are writing that while they are Prime Minister, 'modi Effect' has become 'modi Defect'

 JBL LIVE200BT Wireless in-ear Neckband Headphones Review: pichley maheene JBL ne bharat main paanch live siries ke headfones ko launch kiya tha
 One of these was a neckband patterned in-ear headphones - JBL Live 200BT
 isaki keemat company ne 5,299 rupee rakhi thi
 However, it is currently being sold for Rs 3,999
 hamane iskaa istemaal kiya he or ab ham iskaa rivyuu aap tak pahunchane ja rahe hai
 Design and comfort Today, wireless headphones with netband pattern are in great demand in the market
 bazaar main neckband pattern vaale kaaphi headfones bhi kaaphi maujuud hai
 However, in terms of its build quality, soft rubber has been used in its good condition, which is quite flexible
 saath hi left or rhite porshan main boton main hard plastic maujuud hai
 Here all the control buttons are given in the right side
 neckband se yearphone ko conect karne ke liye jo vir diya gaya he, wo kaaphi chota he or isamen frabric coating kii gai he
 In this case, it is very easy to keep and use
 iskaa placement is tarah se kiya gaya he ki ye istemaal ke vakt thik kaan ke neeche thaharte hai
 The good thing is that in it earbuds have been given a special angle for better grip and better sound output in the ears
 iske rhite said ke plastic panel main andar do LED indicater (charging or connactivity), micro USB charging port, microphone or power on / of switch diya gaya he
 It is very easy to connect
 power batan ke liye alag se switch diya gaya he, jiske liye keval single acces hi kaaphi he
 On the other side, there is a slightly embossed multi button on the outside and there are volume rockers
 multi batan kaa upyog song play / poj, kol cat / risive or dabl tap par google assistant yaa siri ko actevet karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, by holding the volume rockers for a few seconds, the song can be preceded or next
 haalanki main aapako yahaan bataanaa chaahunga ki iske wolum rockers ko istemaal karne main thodi pareshaani hoti he
 Because volume rockers are slightly less raised than multi buttons
 aise main ise istemaal karte vakt thodaa stregal karnaa hota he
 It is possible that the company may have done this for easy access to multi-buttons, but due to this the problem increases
 isaki overol bild quality kii baat karen to ye upyog main kaaphi aasaan he or body material bhi kaaphi majboot or shandaar he
 But the problem is that it is not so good looking
 yani pehali baat to nakband se yearphone ko atech karne ke liye die gaye wyres chote hai
 If you attach them to the magnets, then it does not look good
 iske alaava ye magnet play / poj jaise koi bhi kaam nahin karata
 Apart from this, it looks quite broad when worn over a shirt
 yani ise kaijuca, semi cajual yaa sporti kisi bhi luk ke shaayad hi parfect kaha ja saktaa he
 Similarly, while wearing shirts, it can also happen that if the microphone is covered by the collar, it becomes difficult to talk during the call and the wires also get stuck
 ye thodaa sa miss balance hone par phisalane bhi lag ta he
 These are some of the problems in this neckband
 parformansyahan 8mm ke dynemic drivers die gaye hai
 We have used this earphone with many genres such as classical, psychedelic rock, jazz, rock, dubstep, EDM, BDM, metal, trance and folk
 lagbhag har johnor main ye in-year bluetooth headphone kamaal kaa audio output detaa he
 Here Highs, Mids and Lows are all perfect
 khaastaur par sab-base kaa output itnaa panchi or crispi he ki aapako kaaphi majaa aa jayega
 As much as the output of the Lows is superb, the Mids and Highs are also sharp and clean
 khaas baat ye he ki is wireles headphone main aap phul sound par bhi iritate nahin honge
 In this case, i would like to give it sound quality 5 / 5 in terms of price
 is price range vanplus kaa Bullets Wireless headphone bhi aata he, jisaki keemat 3,990 rupee he
 We used it too, but the audio quality of jbl's Live 200BT is much better
 colling parformens ke liye baat karen to isamen chunki active nois canselation kaa feechar nahin he to bazaar jaisi jagahon yaa bike main tej chalate vakt baat karne main thodi dikkat ho sakati he
 There will be no problem in the rest of the regular calls
 iske alaava bydaree kii baat karen to ise puri tarah charge hone main 2 ghante kaa vakt lagata he or ek baar puri tarah charge karne ke baad hamane ise lagbhag 9
 Has run for 5 hours
 is lihaaj se bydaree parformens bhi kaaphi damdaar he
 In the case of Faisaluk, these headphones can disappoint a bit
 baaki audio lovers ke liye ise bajet range main sabase best wireles bluetooth yearphone kaha ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the music enthusiasts can easily invest in it

 The news of the return of two batches of the Mansarovar Yatra, which reached Nathu La in Sikkim, back from the Chinese border, has raised concerns about the third batch of passengers staying in the capital Delhi
 dilli main maansarovar yatra ke liye jane vaale logon ke liye tehraane kii vyavastha gujarati samaaj bhawan main rahati he or yahaan par tisare jatthe ke tirthayatri medical chekup ke liye aa chuke hai
 These passengers will be sent to Nathu La on June 27 after getting fitness in the medical checkup
 dilli main tirth yatra vikaas samiti ke chairman camel bansal is baat ko lekar zyada chintit hai ki pehle ravaanaa kiye gaye donon jatthon ko china ne waapas lautaa diya he
 There are 47 people in the first batch and 44 people in the second batch
 maansarovar yatra ke donon jatthon ko china ne nathu-laa darre se waapas lautaa diya he
 By the way, the reason behind this is being told that there has been a landslide in Tibet on the way to the journey of Mansarovar, so the journey cannot be done yet
 camel bansal ke mutabik tirthayatriyon ko philhal gangtok main rakhaa gaya he
 Sikkim tourism is taking full care of these people
 unhone ye bhi jaankaree di ki china ke inkaar ko dekhte huedilli sarkaarne videsh mantralay se is maamle main dakhal dene kii guzarish kii he, lekin abhi tak tirth yatra vikaas samiti ke paas videsh mantralay kii taraf se koi khaas jaankaree nahin ai he
 Significantly, Prime Minister Modi inaugurated the country's longest bridge over the Brahmaputra river connecting Arunachal Pradesh in Assam
 is udghaatan ke baad china ke ravaiye main badlaav aayaa he
 After this, China had reduced the earlier 8 batches allowed for Mansarovar Yatra through Nathu La to just 7 batches
 aise main nathu-laa ke jariye maansarovar yatra ke liye nikle pehle do jatthon ko border se bairang waapas lautaa dene ko bhi sanshay kii nigaah se dekha ja rahaa he
 Kamal Bansal, chairman of the Teerth Yatra Vikas Samiti in Delhi, says that the phone calls of relatives of the pilgrims who have gone to both the jathas are constantly receiving them and they are not able to answer them correctly
 udhar maansarovar yatra ke liye dilli main tehre hue tisare jatthe ke yatriyon kaa kahana he kiyatra ko lekaruhapoh kii sthiti bani hui he
 The Government of India should take initiative on this issue soon
 yatriyon ko ummid he ki china apane border ko maansarovar yatriyon ke liye kholegaa or unki muraad puri hogi

 bijepi kii teesri list aa chuki he
 The BJP has so far declared a total of 371 candidates in the three lists
 403 vidhansabha siton par hone vaale chunaavon main ab sirf 32 siton par ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa honi baaki he
 After the third list came out, it is being said that what happened in Purvanchal was what BJP MP Yogi Adityanath wanted
 yogi adityanath ne jise-jise chaha tikat mila he
 In the third list, Yogi Hawi tell you that Vipin Singh has been given ticket from Gorakhpur Rural Assembly seat, Rajesh Tripathi from Chilupar and Vimlesh Paswan, brother of BJP MP Kamlesh Paswan from Bansgaon
 iske alaava campiorganj se fateh bahadur singh ko bijepi ne tikat diya he, ye sabhi yogi kii good list main aate hai
 Apart from this, Sheetal Pandey, who is considered to be special of Yogi from Sahajanwa seat, got the ticket
 jabaki piparich se mahendra paal singh saithwaar ne tikat paane main safalataa pai he
 The CM has been in the discussion as a face, for the last several months, his supporters have been campaigning to make Yogi Adityanath the UP CM face of the BJP
 hinduvadi netaa yogi adityanath kii khatir jansamarthan jutaney ke liye soshal media kaa bhi jamkar istemaal kiya ja rahaa tha
 Recently, the workers of BJP Minority Front in Gorakhpur had also climbed khichdi in Gorakhnath temple to make MP Yogi Adityanath the Chief Minister
 lekin, prayaas safal nahin rahaa
 However, political experts believe that if the BJP projects Yogi as CM, then in the event of polarization of votes, the party can get some benefit
 bijepi ne yogi ko siem candidet to nahin banaaya lekin yah jarur he ki tikat bantwaare main unki pasand ko praathamikta de unki naaraazgi taalane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Let us tell you that Yogi Adityanath would have wanted at least this time that even if his opinion is not taken on all the seats of gorakhpur-basti division, at least a dozen seats should be given to his people
 lekin, bijepi kaa sheersh netritv chahta he ki ve donon mandalon hi nahin gorakhpur kshetra ke 11 jilon kii sabhi 65 siton par prachaar kar party ke pratyaashiyon kii jeet sunishchit karen
 For this, also install Hindu Yuva Vahini and fight your people in 2-4 seats as before

 According to the survey, Akhilesh Yadav was the first choice of voters as Chief Minister
 lekin siem ke taur par top 5 chehron main bijepi ke do naam saamne aae the
 Among the BJP leaders, the first choice for the people was the Home Minister of the country and former UP CM Rajnath Singh, while the fiery Hinduist leader Yogi Adityanath was second
 ye tha pasand kaa pratishwakhilesh yadav- 33%mayawati- 25%rajnath singh- 20%yogi adityanath- 18%yogi kaa purvanchal main he dabadabaguru gorakshnath peeth ke peethadhishwar va saansad yogi adityanath purvanchal main hindutv kaa sabase pramukh cheharaa hai
 Known for his sharp Hinduist image, Yogi is an unstoppable MP from the BJP
 iske alava ve apana ek samanaantar sanghathan 'hindu yuva vahini' bhi chalaate hai
 The people of this organization are not devoted to BJP but to Yogi Adityanath
 yah sanghathan purvanchal main kaaphi sakriy he jis vajah se is kshetra main yogi kaa raajnneetik dabadabaa bhi bana hua he
 Three mlas belonging to Yogi's Hindu Yuva Vahini in 2007 Three people from Hindu Yuva Vahini who got tickets from BJP in the 2007 assembly elections were also successful in winning the election
 isamen kushinagar ke naurangiya seat se shambhu choudhary, ramkola se atul singh va gorakhpur gramin se vijay bahadur yadav shaamil the
 In the 2012 elections too, Yogi Adityanath was given four seats by the BJP, but in the elections, all but Vijay Bahadur Yadav of Gorakhpur Rural had to face defeat

 Roads are considered to be the arteries of development
 isiilie centre sarkaar ne maovadi hinsa se jujh rahe bastar ko uske maujuuda halaat se ubaarane ke liye 2009 main vahaan sadakon kaa jaal bichaane kaa lakshya rakhaa tha
 Under the Special Action Plan item for Left Wing Extremism affected areas, 23 roads were to be completed in three years
 yahaan par police or ardhsainik balon ke kul 40,000 se zyada jawan tainaat hai lekin ve bhi maovadiyon kaa khauf kam nahin kar paae hai
 This is the reason why not one of the proposed roads has been built till date
 desh main vampanthi ugravad se prabhavit ilaakon ke liye centre sarkaar ne ekikrut kaaryayojna taiyaar kii thi, jisamen praathamikta ke taur par prabhavit kshetron main sadakon kaa nirmaan kiya janaa tha
 In view of the inconvenience at work in sensitive areas, a separate amount was sanctioned for these roads under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana
 prabhavit ilaakon main khaas tarah ke jokhim ko dekhte hue hi thekedaaron ne vahaan chaalu daron se kahin badha-chadhaakar nividaayen bhari thim or sarkaar ne inhen manjuur bhi kar liya tha
 1,506 crore here

 It was felt that the government's dream of connecting the interior areas cut off from the main stream with other areas will be fulfilled
 lekin sweekrut 23 sadakon main se ab tak ek kaa bhi kaam puraa nahin ho paaya he
 Of these, no contractor has been found for 8 roads
 vahiin, bijapur jile kii modakapal-tarlaguda, mariyagundam- chintalnar or nelsonar, kodoli or gangalor ke bich teen sadakon kaa kaam isliye nirast karnaa padaa padaa kyonki 215 karod ru
 m / s Neeraj Cement Structural Limited of Mumbai, which had taken the contract for this, could not start the work
 baaki kii sadakon kaa kaam kachua chaal se chal rahaa he
 The first phase of road construction is not taking the name of completion
 duusari ore, lok nirmaan vibhaag ne duusare charan ke liye un kshetron kaa chayan kar liya he, jahaan aasaani se or tay samay seemaa main kaam ko puraa kiya ja sake

 In this plan, about 69 km of state highway between sukma-dantewada is also to be rebuilt
 sadak nirmaan ke liye thekedaar nahin milane kii vajah maovadiyon ke utpaat ke alaava prashasan kii udaseenta bhi he
 In fact, in Maoist affected areas, there is always a risk of damage and arson in vehicles and machines engaged in road construction
 vajah: maovadi vikaas kaaryon ko anjaam tak pahunchane nahin dena chaahate hai
 But in such cases, very little compensation is given by the administration in lieu of loss
 taaja maamla katekalyan-dantewada road nirmaan kaa he
 On 5 February this year, Maoists attacked near Pondum and set fire to two tippers, the Vibro Roller, engaged in road construction
 poklen mashin ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaa
 This gives the contractor around Rs 40 lakh
 kaa nuksaan hua lekin iskievaj main prashasan ne mahaj dedh lakh ru
 Compensation amount of Rs
 ek thekedaar kehete hai, ‘‘vaahanon or mashiinon kaa paryaapt beemaa cover hone par yaa prashasan kii guarantee par hi kaam karne kaa jokhim uthaaya ja saktaa he, lekin aise maamalon main prashasan main ichhashakti kii kami najar aati he
 One of the problems of the contractors is that they have to take the work from the local workers who do not want to work under the protection of the police
 isliye jokhim hone ke baavjood thekdaar suraksha nahin lete
 Maoist incidents are also increasing
 bijapur ke police adheekshak prashanth agarwal kehete hai, ‘‘har nirmaan kaary ke liye thekedaar ke kehane par suraksha di jaati he
 But according to Mandhan, the contractors do not start the work despite providing police protection

 The High Court said that how many times such a committee has called the Chief Secretary, you do not respect your Chief Secretary, while the public respects him and his post
 court ne kamity se poocha ki kya unako bulaane ke liye aapke paas koi or rasta nahin tha, mukhya sachiv se jaankaree lene kaa kya yahi akhiri rasta tha
 The court said that by giving such notice, you are working to add fuel to the fire
 notice or baad main hone vaali karrwai ko lekar lagaai gai yachika par samiti ke vakil ne kaha ki hamaara koi political vendata nahin he, lekin mukhya sachiv sahyog nahin kar rahe hai
 Earlier, the Question and Reference Committee and the Privilege Committee of the Delhi Legislative Assembly on Sunday accused the Chief Secretary by holding a press conference
 aarope tha ki mukhya sachiv vidhansabha samiti kii kaarywahi main bhaag na lene ke liye jhooth kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said that in his affidavit filed in the Delhi High Court regarding the proceedings of the committee, lie was lied on behalf of Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash, which the Question and Reference Committee has objected to
 philhal aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon kii sadsyta vaali dilli vidhansabha kii kamity or mukhya sachiv ke bich takaraav shuru ho gaya he
 Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash filed an affidavit in the High Court against the committee meeting and for not being involved in the proceedings of the meeting
 kamity kaa aarope tha ki dilli ucch nyaayalay main daayar kii gai apni nai yachika main, dilli sarkaar ke vartmaan mukhya sachiv anshu prakaash ne tathyon ko bigaadane kaa prayaas kiya he
 According to the Legislative Committee, a case in connection with a scam of at least Rs 100 crore in Delhi Citizen Co-operative Bank Limited came before the Speaker of Delhi Legislative Assembly in January 2017
 yah samiti march 2017 ke baad se is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 What is the whole matter (according to the Legislative Committee)
 
 
 2013 main bank ke sadasyon ne aniyamittaaon ko lekar bank, aaarasies or bhartiya rigerv bank ko shikaayat kii
 In this complaint, he told how fake loans were given according to the convenience of the directors of the bank, due to which the bank went into loss
 november 2013: arabiai ne lajpat nagar shakha ke bare main ek report di or farji rin badha die gaye
 Many secretaries and registrars came and went on transfer but the situation remained the same

 13 January 2017: RCS Shurveer Singh heard the case and reserved the date of its decision itself
 lekin antat: koi aadesh jari nahin kiya gaya
 January 18, 2017: In Delhi Assembly session, the matter was taken up by the MLA in non-starred Question No 62

 In response to this, the reply from the Department of Cooperatives was found to be incomplete and unsatisfactory
 15 march 2017: vidhansabha adhyaksh ne is maamle ko prashn or sandarbh samiti ko preshit kiya
 The matter has been running in the committee for one year, but no action has been taken against fake loans based on fake property papers, ITR
 kya he vidhansabha kamity kaa aropavidhansabha kamity kaa aarope he ki mukhya sachiv anshu prakaash ne dilli ucch nyaayalay main 20 farvari ko police ke paas daayar marpet kii shikaayat or samiti kii kaarywahi ko ek saath jodne kaa prayaas kiya he
 The committee also alleges that when asked about the loan of crores of rupees given by the bank officials related to Anshu Prakash through fake papers, they are now trying to divert attention from this scam
 vidhansabha kamity ke mutabik yah record main he ki mukhya sachiv anshu prakaash 16 farvari ko samiti ke samaksh upasthit hue or kaha ki maujuuda or purv aaarasies samiti kii baithak main maujuud nahin the, isliye unhen or samay diya jaae or unki darkhwaast par samiti kii taraf se unhen or samay diya gaya
 After this the committee had given time on his request but on 20 February he again asked for time and hence the committee meeting was called again the next day
 kamity ne aage bataaya ki 21 farvari ko mukhya sachiv anshu prakaash ne apane swasthya kaarnon kaa hawala dete hue samiti kii baithak main shaamil hone main asamarthta jaahir kii
 Whereas, it was surprising that on the same day he attended all other meetings, including a meeting in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), but cited being ill as a reason for being unable to attend the Delhi Assembly Committee meeting
 
 dilli vidhansabha kamitine bataaya ki vartmaan or purv aaarasies ne kamity ko likhit jaankaree di he ki unhone mukhya sachiv ko maamle ko bheja he, isliye ve mukhya sachiv dwaara agle nirdesh tak baithkon main shaamil nahin ho sakate
 The committee alleges that the chief secretary is using the police complaint related to the assault as a shield to divert attention from the bank scam

 Is INDIAN DIET Healthy? Considering on this a lot of us stops thinking that “indian food is unhealthy” but if you see Indian thali has everything like roti, beans, legumes, vegetable and non veg based upon which part of India it is? While we know how healthy Indian food is, where we often go wrong with is our over-indulgence in fried Indian snacks
 These are usually consumed after 6 pm and result in bulging tummies and high fat percentages
 This is the first step towards all kinds of lifestyle issues like diabetes, thyroid, obesity, pcod etc
 This is part of your diet where you have to work

 puja kahati hai ki mahilaon ko physical activity jarur kerani chahie isse naa keval tanaav kam hota he balki periods ke dard main bhi kami aati he
 Pooja really encourages many people with her story
 chhattisgarh ke sahakaari bainkon main 15 sau karod se zyada kaa ghotaalaa saamne aayaa he
 The cooperative bank of Raipur and Bilaspur alone has a breakup of 1200 crores
 jabaki shesh 300 karod se zyada ke rakam kii herapheri rajya ke duusare jilon main hui he
 Politicians and bank officials have come up to suppress the scam
 haalanki, chhattisgarh vidhansabha ke andar or baahar bijepi or congress donon hi partiyon ke vidhayak is ghotaale kii jaanch sibiai ko saupane kii maang kar rahe hai
 Co-operative bank CEO JM Taneja has resigned from his post after the scandal surfaced
 chhattisgarh ke sahakaari bainkon main 1500 karod se zyada ke golmaal ko lekar gahamaa-gahami machi he
 Bank officials have kept the file of this scam under pressure since a year
 ise naa to RBI ko saunpa ja rahaa he or naa hi police ko
 Actually, many big leaders are involved in this scam
 ghotaale kaa lekha-jokha taiyaar hone ke baad kai netaaon ne bainkon ke gavarning body se apana naata tod liya he
 There are 6 large cooperative banks in Chhattisgarh
 rajya bhar main inaki 265 shakhayein hai
 More than 52 lakh farmers are customers of these cooperative banks
 inhen sahakaari bainkon ke jariye desh ke PDS system ke liye dhan kii kharidi hoti hai
 The central and state government through the cooperative banks put about 15,000 crore rupees in the farmers' account every year
 yah rakam sarkaar ko dhan bechney vaale kisaanon ke khaaton main jamaa kii jaati he
 Long and short loans are provided to the farmers through these banks under different government schemes
 iske alaava dhan se chaaval nikaalane vaali milon, dhan or chaaval kaa uthaav karne vaali sansthaaon, khadd, uria kii supplai kaa bhugtan or kheti kisaani se jude sabhi aarthik maamalon kaa len-dein sahakaari bainkon ke jariye hota he
 The subsidy from the central government to the farmers reaches the common farmers through these cooperative banks
 bataaya jaataa he ki bade paimaane par kisaanon ke farji khate khol kar usame jamaa hui sabsidi bank afasaron or rajanetaaon ne hadap lee
 Raipur has seen 500 such businessmen, who have quoted billions through the cooperative bank
 raipur main 800 karod, bilaspur main 600 karod, raigarh, dhamtari, durg or mahasamund jile main 300 karod se zyada kii rakam kaa golmaal saamne aayaa he
 In its annual audit report for the year 2015-16, the bank has classified all the scams as loss and embezzlement
 is audit report main yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki sarkari or nijee kshetron ke bainkon se mili rakam kaa samaayojan or balance certificate main pravishthiyaan darj nahin kii gayi hai
 At the same time, a large amount of money has also been transferred from cooperative banks to nationalized government and private banks
 udhar, sahakaari bainkon kaa ghotaalaa saamne aane ke baad sarkaar maamle ko police ko saunpane ke bajaae tribunel banaakar jaanch karne kaa upkram khoj rahi he
 According to Satyanarayana Sharma, an MLA from Raipur and associated with the cooperative, the government is engaged in suppressing the entire scam
 afasar jail jane ke dar se asli report shashan ko nahin saunp rahe hai
 However, this serious matter should be immediately referred to the police or other investigating agencies
 unke mutabik, centre sarkaar se milane vaali badi rakam kaa golmaal hua he
 Therefore, the CBI should directly intervene
 mahasamund se vidhayak vimal chopra ke mutabik ghotaale kaa praathmik akda hi 1500 karod ke lagbhag he
 If investigated, this amount may increase further
 chhattisgarh vitt ayog ke adhyaksh chandrashekhar sahu ne sarkaar se maang kii he ki wo jald tamaam audit report or dastavejon ko apane kabje main le
 Otherwise the bank officer can make the record disappear
 unke mutabik ghotaale ko suniyojit rup se anjaam diya gaya he
 Co-operative bank notes in Chhattisgarh came to the limelight during the bandh when black money was consumed on a large scale in farmers' accounts
 sahakaari bainkon kii tamaam shakhaon main kareeb ek hajaar karod ke len-dein kii jaanch abhi bhi chal rahi he
 Meanwhile, this well-planned scandal in the bank has created panic in and outside the assembly

 bhaawanaaon kaa ufaan dikhaane vaale is video ko ‘aaazaad bharat’ ke naam vaale fasebuk pej par haal hi main aplod kiya gaya
 Viral on social media, the post was titled that the Communist government of Kerala is fomenting Hindus
 jaahir he naaraazgi jataate hue post par coment kaa tantaa lag gaya
 In some comments, abuses were used directly against the cpm-led Left Front government in the state
 india today ke viral test team ne video kii padtaal kii to paaya ki sambandhit fasebuk pej par jaanboojh kar ghatana ke sthaan ko galat bataaya gaya
 This was probably done to provoke anger among the Hindus against the Left Government in Kerala
 viral test main paaya gaya sambandhit footage kerala kii nahin balki tamilnadu kii he
 In a post uploaded on 7 July on the Facebook page of 'azad India', it was alleged that the Kerala government was shunning Hindu temples
 kya wo kisi carch yaa masjid ko gira sakate hai? post par aae kuch caments ko neeche diya ja rahaa he jinamein communist sarkaar ko agle vidhansabha chunaav main kerala se ukhaad dene kii baat tak kahi gai
 Viral test team looked closely at the footage and found that the van used to remove protesters from the scene could be seen written on the VKT Highway Patrol (NH45C)
 VKT kaa istemaal vikravandi, kumbhakonam or thanjavur ke liye kiya gaya he jo teenon hi tamilnadu main maujuud he
 Apparently the highway van seen in the footage was not patrolling in Kerala
 viral test kii padtaal main saamne aayaa ki 2013 se 2016 ke bich tamilnadu main VKT hive ke paas vyapak taur par virodh pradarshan hue the
 The NHAI (national Highways Authority of India) had then tried to remove or restore some of the ancient temples that came in the way of the road construction project
 villupuram or kumbhakonam jilon main kam se kam do pradarshan hue the, jinamein sthaneey logon ne virodh pradarshan kiya tha

 He had also raised this issue in front of the then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister j Jayalalithaa
 villupuram main bhi logon ke virodh pradarshan ke baad 1300 saal puraane shiv mandir ko hataane kii koshish se haath waapas khinch liye the
 The viral test revealed that the post was uploaded on the Facebook page of 'azad Bharat' with a fake claim under the malice

 RTI activist Subhash Aggarwal, who has applied for RTI, said he was surprised by the sudden change in the stance of the ministry, under which these exemptions have been cited in refusing to give information about some selected cases
 
 kanwal sibbalapadosiyon ke saath sambandh sudhaarna sabhi sarkaron ke tahat bhartiya videsh niti ke centre main rahaa he
 Many challenges have to be found in making an optimal policy
 hamaare chote padosiyon ko hamaare aakaar se khatra mahasoos hota he, ve apni samprabhutaa ke kisi bhi kathith ulanghan par aag babula ho jate hai, santulan kii ranneeti ke rup main duusari badi shaktiyon se meljol badhaane lagate hai, hamaare kathith 'adhinayakawadi' jaise ravaiye ke ird-gird apni gharelu raajnneeti chalaate hai, badale main bina kisi udaartaa kaa pradarshan karte hue hamase har tarah kii udaartaa kii ummid karte hai
 Furthermore, they remain apprehensive about losing identity due to regional, ethnic, linguistic, religious and cultural ties alike
 isi 4 disambar ko hamane purv pradhanmantri or do baar ke videsh mantri indra kumaar gujarat kii sauveen jayanti manaai
 The same Gujral, who understood these complexities for the first time in September 1996, formulated a local policy which was to change the image of India from that of a regional head to the image of a liberal country without any special expectation from neighbors
 Wish to take them along
 ise gujral siddhant kaha jaataa he jisamen paanch mul siddhanton ko rekhaankit kiya gaya
 First, India, along with Nepal, Bangladesh, Maldives and Sri Lanka, will not expect a return but will be ready to do whatever is possible on its behalf to build goodwill and trust
 (bhutan ko is suchi se baahar rakhaa gaya kyonki yah bhaavana dwipaksheeya sambandhon main antarnihit thi)
 The other four principles involved resolving not to use their earth against each other, interfering in the internal affairs of the other, respecting each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and peaceful settlement of disputes through bilateral negotiations
 
 pehla siddhant paaramparik rajanyik soch se bahut itar vichaar tha
 Such theories reflect the preferred strategy, without any assurance of success, because it will depend on small neighbors how much they adhere to these principles
 1990 ke dashak main jammu-kashmir main pakistan pryojit aatankwaad charam par tha
 In such a situation, it was meaningless to expect that he would respect the core elements of the Gujral doctrine
 phir bhi, june 1996 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri gujral ne ek videsh sachiv str kii baithak ko hari jhandi di, jisamen samgr vaarta ke beej boe gaye the
 However, the talks remained inconclusive as Gujral turned down the demand for a separate working group on Kashmir
 samgr vaarta baad main shuru hui par tut gai jisane bataaya ki bharat ke saath chirshatrutapurna vyavhaar karne vaale pakistan ke saath shantipurna sambandhon ke kisi bhi siddhant kii apni simaaen hai
 Today, with the abolition of Article 370 of the Constitution and redefining the map of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state, the basic principles of any bilateral dialogue with Pakistan have completely changed
 bangladesh ke saath disambar 1996 kii ganga jal sandhi gujral siddhant kii ek badi uplabdhi thi
 Despite international pressure, Gujral strongly refused to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in October 1996
 saahas ke saath us vakt unhone india today ko bataaya tha ki bharat na to apane parmaanu vikalp kaa aatmasamarpan karegaa, na hi vah alag-thalag kar die jane se ghabaraata he
 Gujral had said that "nations like those who bow down or bow down are never respected

 The figures of crime in Delhi are now scaring the Delhiites who have been battling with electricity, water and inflation for a year
 gujarata saal jate-jate dilli waalon ko wo daraavna aankada de gaya he jise dekh or sun kar yakeen nahin hota ki ye desh kii rajdhani dilli he
 In the year 100 percent crime has increased in Delhi
 2000 se zyada rape, 550 se zyada murder, 6000 se zyada lut
 These figures do not belong to us
 balki pichley saal ke jurm ke hisaab-kitaab ke saath dilli police ne shuukravaar ko media se mukhaatib hokar khud isaki jaankaree di he
 The crimes in Delhi from January 1 to December 15, 2014 include 561 murder, 2069 rapes, 1282 cases of molestation, 6180 robbery cases and 6944 cases of snooping
 yah tacover logon kaa dilli he
 The court of the country seems to be here
 desh chalaane vaale yaheen basate hai or desh kii sabase smart police force kaa tamanna bhi isi shahar ke paas he
 When the 2069 rape took place on December 16, 2012, its smart police force consoled the Delhiites that they would give full strength to protect the dignity of women
 par phir kisi or ko nirbhaya banane nahin denge
 The year Nirbhaya had made 706 Nirbhaya's death in Delhi that year
 pataa nahi dilli police ne koun sa dilasa diya tha ki 2013 main rape kaa aankada 706 se sidhe 1636 ja puhancha
 Thought let's take time to handle things
 sanbhal jayega
 But thought wrong kroonki 201414 main to saare ricard hi tut gaye
 The rape figure reached 2069
 yani dilli main har rose ausatan 5 se 6 rape ke maamle hote hai
 561 Murder Delhi has a similar view after every murder incident
 bevakt maut pariwaron ko tod jaataa he
 Delhi Police had promised that they would control these wretched screams as well
 par hua kya? 2013 main dilli ne 486 logon kaa khun dekha tha
 This figure reached 561 in 14
 ye to baangi bhar he
 Otherwise leave a road accident, robbery, robbery, molestation
 jhapatmari, chori, vaahan chori bas aap jurmon ke naam yaad kiijie darawane aankade hajir hai
 The list of crimes of IPC has been increased by that list
 kul mila kar dilli main aparaadh kaa graph saal 13 ke mukaable 14 main 183 fisadi bad gaya he
 Why crime is increasing? Now the question is why the crime graph is increasing in Delhi? Has the Delhi Police failed to do its duty? Has the Delhi Police been afraid of the perpetrators? Is Delhi's growing population responsible for the rising graph of crime? Or is it because of free registration i
e
 registering FIR in every case honestly? Delhi Commissioner, Bassi says that the reason is that the police now register firs honestly, so the figures increased
 par sawaal ye he ki jab jurm hota he tabhi to exiaar darj hoti he
 Then isn't this plea childish? Increased honesty in registering an FIR? Khamkha We were all screaming for the Delhi Police for the last two years
 unki kamiyon kaa ronaa ro rahe the
 He was angry at his kahili
 jabaki sach to aaj kamishnar sahab ne bolaa
 a truth that opens anyone's eyes
 sach ye ki dilli main mahilaon ke khilaaf or baaki aparaadh kaa graph isile badha he kyonki police ab eemaandaaree se aise maamle darj karti he
 That is, the cases of rape, murder or molestation in Delhi did not increase due to the inefficiency of the police
 naa hi isamen police kii koi khami he
 The fault lies with the poor who rape and murder
 police main kahaan koi khami he
 She honestly registers FIA after the rape
 par kamishnar sahab
 Just tell me that your police work is just to register FIA? If rape or other crimes are increasing in Delhi only because of FIR data, then what is the work of such a huge police force? Why is this police? What is it for Show poor poise and the police keep writing just reports of their poise? Isn't police work to stop crime? Isn't the police's job to stop rape? You are saying that the crime figures are increasing due to free registration
 to kya exapar yunhi likh liye jate he? jaahir he jab jurm hota he tabhi exias darj hota he
 If your police stop him before committing the crime, then where will you come to write the FIA? And anyway, the job of the police is to stop the crime and not to put our foot down by saying that we file an FIR honestly, so the crime figures are increasing
 saal bhar main sau fisadi krime bad janaa kisi bhi shahar or us shahar main rahanewaalon ke liye phikr kii baat he kamishnar sahab

 vipaksh kisanyukt sansadeey samiti(jepisi) maang ko lekar sansad ke bajet satr par ashankaon ke badal chhaae rahane ke bich bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laal krishna adwani ne kaha he ki sarkaar agar vipaksh ko sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr ke pehle din bolne kaa mauka detii to puraa satr baadhit nahin hota
 Advani has written about this on his blog
 bhaajapa netaa ke mutabik, ‘jab 2011 kii shuruuaat hui thi, tab maine kaha tha ki gujara saal ghotaalon or scandlon kaa saal rahaa
 In actuality, on the first day of the winter session of the Lok Sabha, the entire opposition led by the BJP decided to take up the three scams, the Commonwealth, 2G and Mumbai's defense land scam
 ’unhone likhaa, ‘agar shuruuaati din hi vipaksh ko apni baat kehane kaa mauka miltaa, to us din or baaki puure satr tak chale gatirodh kii naubat hi nahin aati
 'advani wrote,' The resentment of the opposition was more because when the Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj started speaking, the entire ruling party did not let him speak
 ’adwani ke mutabik, iske baad sabhi vipakshi dal is nishkarsh par pahunche ki jab tak sarkaar in ghotaalon kii jaanch ke liye jepisi banane ke liye taiyaar nahin ho jaati, tab tak sansad main koi kaam nahin hoga
 Advani has written that the government and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha held a series of meetings to resolve the deadlock, but the issue could not be resolved
 aagaamee bajet satr ke bare main unhone likhaa, ‘‘ab jab, bajet satr shuru hone vaala he, tab sarkaar vipaksh ke saath lagaataar baithken kar rahi he or sarkaar ko lag rahaa he ki in paristhitiyon main jepisi bananaa hi uske liye aage kaa sahi kadam hoga
 Regarding last week's meeting with the editors of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Advani wrote, "this meeting which took place last week was disturbing
 isamen gathbandhan kii majaburiyon par zyada charchaa kii gai or bhrashtachar isamen kahin dab kar rah gaya
 ' is saal kii ‘maai nej ij khan’ or ‘housephul’ ho yaa pichley saal kii ‘thri idiyats’ or ‘wanted’, in sabhi filmon main samanta yah he ki inke tital angreji shabdon par aadhaarit hai
 The much-awaited 'kites' starring Hrithik Roshan, released this Friday, is one such example which the audience was eagerly awaiting with film critics
 janvari 2010 se ab tak bollywood kii 59 hindi filmein relies huin, jinamein 34 filmon ke naam angreji tital par hai
 However, in the year 2009, out of 84 films, 50 films were in English
 pichley kuch saalon main bhi angreji tital ke saath ai hindi filmon kii lambii fehrist he
 While films like 'singh is King', 'race' and 'fashion' had made a big splash in the box office in 2008, 'welcome', 'chak De India' 'hey Baby' and 'partner' in 2007 too
 Also earned fiercely
 film sameekshak jyoti venkatesh is bare main kehete hai ki ‘global aprope’ hi bollywood filmon main badhate angreji titalon kaa kaaran he or desh ke saath videshon main bhi relies hone par in filmon ko phayda hota he kyonki nirmaataa or nirdeshak kaa dhyaan ‘targel vyler’ par hota he
 Venkatesh said, 'this (english title) is a great example of global approach
 aisi filmein agar urisa yaa tamilnadu main bhi relies hoti hai to log samaj jate hai
 With this, Bollywood movies are now being released in foreign countries as well
 ’ aane vaale dinon main ‘kits’ ke alaava ‘vans apon e time in mumbai’ or ‘no van kild jesica’ jaisi angreji tital vaali kai filmein qatari main hai jinase bollywood ko bahut ummiden hai
 The film critic said, 'the makers also pay attention to the' target viewer 'because once the film was made in five thousand and now it is made in 50-60 crores
 is lihaaj se yah behatar he ki kathin hindi kii jagah film kaa shishark aam bolchaal vaala ho, phir chaahe vah angreji par hi aadhaarit ho
 Several other films like "striker", "right Ya Rong" and "love, Sex and Cheat" also came this year and flopped badly
 yani isse ek baat spasht he ki angreji tital safalataa kii guarantee nahin hai
 Venkatesh said, 'english titles are not only guaranteed to be a hit, the content of the film is the biggest thing
 haalanki phir bhi log ise hit formula maanakar chalate hai
 'but the question is whether Hindi itself is responsible for the increasing dominance of English in Bollywood films
 nardarn riginal lenguage centre ke principal or bhashaa vigyaani doctor rup krishna bhatta kaa kahana he ki sanchaar ke madhyamon main angreji ke badhate str ke liye hindi bhi jimmedaar he kyonki hindi kii shabdaawalee kai maamalon main bahut kathin he isliye log praaia: kathin hindi shabdon kaa prayog karne se bachate hai or angreji shabdon kaa prayog shuru kar dete hai
 Bhatt said, 'hindi vocabulary is tougher than English on many subjects
 is vajah se log aam bolchaal main angreji ke shabdon kaa prayog karne lagate hai
 Also, the media also plays an important role in this matter
 ’ yah bhashaa vigyaani hindi main anya bhashaaon ke shabdon ke istemaal kaa swaagat karte hai lekin unka kahana he ki iskaa asar samskruti par nahin padana chahie
 He said, 'no language is bad
 isi tarah angreji ke kuch shabdon kaa prayog karne main koi buraai nahin he lekin unki samskruti ko nahin apanaaya ja saktaa

 In the case of 2005, 22 people are facing trial, mostly policemen
 yahaan kii ek vishesh sibiai adaalat is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi he
 The matter has received special attention as BJP President Amit Shah was among the accused
 haalanki, unhen 2014 main aarope mukt kar diya gaya tha
 Shah was the Home Minister of Gujarat at the time of these incidents
 mukademe ke dauraan abhiyojan paksh ke kareeb 92 gavaah mukar gaye
 After the last arguments were completed earlier this month, special CBI cases judge SJ Sharma had said that he would deliver the verdict on December 21
 zyaadaatar aaropee gujarat or rajasthan ke kanishtha str ke police adhikari hai
 The court acquitted 16 of the 38 people named in the CBI charge sheet for lack of evidence
 inamen amit shah, rajasthan ke tatkaaleen grih mantri gulabchand kataaria, gujarat police ke purv pramukh pisi pandey or gujarat police ke purv varisht adhikari diji vanjaaraa shaamil hai
 According to the CBI, the alleged gangster Sheikh, his wife Kausar Bi and his accomplice Prajapati, who had links with the terrorists, were abducted by a bus by the Gujarat Police when they were taken from Hyderabad to Maharashtra on the intervening night of 22 and 23 November 2005
 Were going to Sangli sibiai ke mutabik shaikh kii 26 november 2005 ko ahmedabad ke paas kathith farji muthbhed main hatya kar di gai
 His wife was killed three days later and her body was stabbed
 saal bhar baad 27 disambar 2006 ko prajapati kii gujarat or rajasthan police ne gujarat - rajasthan seemaa ke paas chapari main kathith farji muthbhed main goli maar kar hatya kar di
 The prosecution questioned 210 witnesses in the case, of which 92 turned hostile
 is bich buudhvaar ko abhiyojan ke do gavaahon ne adaalat se darkhwaast kii ki unase phir se poochtacha kii jaae
 One of them is named Azam Khan and was an associate of Sheikh

 Another witness is Mahendra Jala, the owner of a petrol pump

 When it took the turn of important decisions after assuming power, BJP found that it is difficult to keep pace with these decisions and the announcements made by the opposition party
 khaskar tab jab use supreme court ke gusse kaa shikaar hona pad rahaa he
 The government wanted to indicate its decisive intentions through a series of economic decisions but had to abort
 vah ekmaatr nirnaayak faisla pratiraksha nirmaan kaa le pai
 According to internal sources, the instruction was broadly to start the work without falling into any mess
 nateeja yah hua ki nidarta ke saath faisle lene kii bajaae saavdhaanee barti jane lagi or baarikiyon ne faislon ko lataka diya
 Coal: Even now there are two more provisions related to this in Section 12 of the Coal Ordinance stuck in the balance
 inke mutabik centre sarkaar is nae kanoon ke baad kol block kaa aavanton ganvaane vaale khadaan maalikon ko karj dene waalon ko muaavja yaa kshatipurti dene ke liye vachanabaddh he
 It also clearly states that the compensation rules will be decided later
 baaki baton ko to bhul hi jaaen
 The government officials themselves believe that this will be a huge task in itself
 muaavje kii rakam par mol-bhav ke liye ek sevanivrutt civil adhikari kii chhatrachhaaya main vishaal naukarshahi kaa dhaancha khadaa karnaa hoga
 Then in addition to such agreements, there is a possibility of getting caught in legal issues
 isse nae boli lagane vaale darkar peeche hat sakate hai
 Hence, it will be difficult to follow the prescribed time limits
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki supreme court se koyala khadaanon ke 214 aavanton radd kar die jane se upje behad mushkil halaat main vah behatar se behatar karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 But the Supreme Court has upheld its decision
 iske liye usne apane 24 sitambar ke aadesh main atorni general (agi) mukul rohtagi kii daleel kaa hi sahaara liya
 The AG had said on behalf of the government that it is ready to accept the decision to cancel the allocation of all coal blocks
 adaalat ne apane aadesh main isi baat kaa zikr kiya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley have often reiterated their promise that the government will use this opportunity to initiate reforms in the coal sector
 is lihaaj se adhyadesh ne nijee companiyon ko khadaanon ke vyavsaayik dohan kii ijaajat dene kii takneekee sambhaavna kaa rasta jarur khol diya he
 Under this, they can be freed from the restrictions of certain end use of coal
 lekin vitt mantri ne yah faisla baad ke liye taal diya he
 This is an indication that they realize the pressure that labor unions can exert
 khaskar tab jab aresas se judaa bhartiya majdoor sangh is kshetra kaa sabase bada shramik sanghathan he
 Gas price: The opposite purpose was the price of gas 8
 4 dollar prati embitiu se kam karne kaa rasta talashna
 This price was fixed by the UPA government through the Rangarajan formula
 yah formula duniya bhar ke vibhinn kshetron main gas kii keemton ke ausat ke aadhaar par tay kiya gaya tha
 It also included the price that India's leading gas import company, Petronet LNG, pays for purchasing natural gas from abroad
 petronet ek anoothaa sarkari upkram he jo gas aayaat karne ke ghoshit uddeshy se banaaya gaya tha
 It was formed with the stake of all the major public sector oil companies
 lekin unki kul hissedari 50 fisadi se adhik nahin ho sakati thi
 As such, it was not a wholly government-owned company and could be excluded from the restrictions of the government's financial regulations
 iske baavjood sabase adhik hissedari kii vajah se petroleum sachiv iske adhyaksh ho sakate the
 Petronet has signed a deal to import gas from Qatar at a rate of around $ 13 per MBTU
 desh ke bheetar utpann gas kii nai keemat kii gananaa ke liye banaae gaye rangarajan formule main yah keemat bhi shaamil kii gai thi
 Now this price has been removed from this formula
 iske saath hi japan kii asian deshon ke liye tay keemat bhi nikaal di gai
 This has been done so that the total price is reduced to 5
 6 dollar prati embitiu tak laayaa ja sake
 The rationale for this was that domestic producers could import gas to artificially inflate the domestic price
 lekin jo baat nahin bataai gai vah yah ki maujuuda samay main koi gharelu company bikri ke liye gas kaa aayaat nahin karti
 On the other hand, Petronet is not involved in domestic production work
 ahm baat yah thi ki gharelu gas utpaadan ko teji se badhaane ke liye adhiktam protsaahan diya jaae
 This is very important to meet the energy needs of the country
 gas kii or adhik khoj se bhavishya main keemten bhi kam kii ja sakati hai
 This is what happened in America
 vahaan shell kii khoj kii vajah se keemten naatakeey dhang se 13 dollar prati embitiu se ghatakar 4 dollar prati embitiu par aa gayi
 On the other hand, prices in China are in the range of $ 10-12 per MBTU 
 ye bazaar aadhaarit keemten hai
 The government could move closer to the formula based on market rates
 lekin rajnatik dushparimaanon se bachane ke liye usne pair peeche khinch liye, upie jahaan khadaa tha vah usase bhi peeche aa gai
 As a result, investment in domestic production was not encouraged
 ek dar yah bhi tha ki utpaadak aayaat ko behatar vikalp na maan len kyonki keemat to antat upabhokta ko hi adaa kerani he
 Immunity: The step in the right direction was to decide in 2007 whether private companies should be allowed to build submarines
 lekin tab dheron andeshon kaa maahaul bana diya gaya
 Despite this, a private shipyard company was handling INS Arihant, a submarine equipped with India's nuclear capability
 aakhirkaar is par vichaar karne ke liye neshnal manuphaccharing compititiveness council ke purv chairman ve
 a committee was formed under the chairmanship of Krishnamurthy
 samiti ne sifarish kii ki kul chah pandubbiyon main se kam-se-kam do ke nirmaan kaa aadesh nijee companiyon ko diya janaa chahie
 Some people in the Ministry of Defense were opposed to this recommendation

 The Modi government allowed India's private companies to bid for the construction of all six submarines in one stroke
 isi ke saath sarkaar ne us bahes ko khatm kar diya jo upie ke raaj main kabhi puri nahin ho sakati thi kyonki tab pradhanmantri karyaalay ek disha main khinchataa tha, to raksha mantralay duusari disha main
 In the defense sector, the Modi government is taking the right steps
 yah vah kshetra he jo upie ke raaj main kisi bhi kism ke sudhaaron se achoota tha
 Now the test is in taking decisions that go against the party's stance
 misaal ke liye sarkaar ko tay karnaa he ki vah duusare deshon ke saath kaamkaaj main ahm dotarafa samjhauton kaa paalan karnaa chaahati he yaa phir videshon main jamaa bharat ke dhan ko waapas laane ke party ke mishan ko puraa karne ke liye in samjhauton par dobaaraa baatcheet karnaa chaahati he

 The hospital is taking care of both the girls and is rearing them because their parents say that they cannot afford the medical expenses of both
 
 Seeing the compulsion of his parents, NDTV pledged to raise the cost of the operation
 beshak, is puure maamle main aspataal kii bhoomika bhi behad ahm rahi jahaan donon bacchiyon ko ghar jaisaa laad or pyaar mila

 It is worth noting that recently, Pakistan's Home Minister Chaudhary Nisar Khan had said that if Narendra Modi becomes the Prime Minister of India, it will pose a threat to regional peace
 nisaar ali khan ne anderworld sargana daaud ibrahim par modi kii tippanee ke liye unki aalochana karte hue unke bayaan ko 'gairjimmedaarana' or 'sharmnaak' qaraar diya tha

 Is Mamta Banerjee a no entry for leaders of other states and opposition parties for campaigning in Bengal? This question is because successive BJP leaders are either not being allowed to land helicopters in Bengal or are not being given grounds to hold meetings
 aaj uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko purulia main sabha karne ke liye helicopter land karne kii anumati nahin mili
 He landed in a chopper near the Bengal border in the bjp-ruled state of Jharkhand
 vahaan se sadak ke jariye sabha karne purulia pahunche
 Earlier, there was a huge verbal war between Mamata and Yogi
 is bich madhyapradesh ke purv mukhyamantri or bijepi ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha he ki bengal sarkaar ne unhen bhi helicopter land karne kii anumati nahin di he
 They have to rally in Baharampur
 isi tarah shahanvaaj hossain ko bhi murshidaabad main raily karne kii anumati nahin di gai he
 Earlier, the West Bengal government did not allow landing of the helicopter of BJP President Amit Shah, after which the BJP had to land the helicopter in a private place
 kendriya mantri smriti irani ke helicopter kii landig kii anumati ko lekar bhi nanukar hoti rahi
 Actually, the BJP is taking out its leaders on a large scale in West Bengal

 BJP wants to hold rallies of its big leaders in all 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state

 The BJP did not even get relief from the Supreme Court on this

 BJP president Amit Shah has also called a meeting of all the general secretaries on February 7 to decide the strategy ahead
 udhar mamata banerjee ne sibiai karrwai ke virodh main centre sarkaar ke khilaaf apana dharna khatm kar diya
 This morning, the Supreme Court said that Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar can be questioned by the CBI in Shillong but cannot arrest him
 mamata ne ise apni naitik jeet bataaya he or aage bhi virodh karte rahane kii baat kahi he
 But the question is how Mamata is describing this as her victory, as the Supreme Court has said that the police commissioner has to assist the CBI in the investigation at all times
 mukhya sachiv, police mahanideshak or police kamishnar ko avmaananaa ke maamle main notice diya he
 On receiving the reply, it will be told by February 19 whether they have to appear in the court themselves on February 20
 vaise mamata sibiai kii karrwai ko loktatra kii hatya bataa chuki hai
 But the question is to stop BJP leaders from exercising their democratic authority, is not Mamata Banerjee also taking steps against democracy? Delhi University main seshan 2017-18 ke liye admician process kaa aaj aakhri din hai

 isi kadi main bhartiya janata party se congress main aae or punjab ke mantri navjot singh siddhu ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki wo garibon kii jagah amiron ke liye kaam karte hai

 The Prime Minister traveled to 55 countries
 ambani or adani ko in 55 deshon main 18 bade theke mili
 In 2015, the Prime Minister visited Russia and Ambani bought a weak company Al Maja Mantle for $ 6 billion and within a month the contract was awarded to Reliance Defense
 unhone aage kaha ki pradhanmantri france ke daure par gaye or vahaan ambani ko ofaset partner bana diya gaya
 The Prime Minister asks for a bill for a pen of 10 rupees, but nothing was given on the Rafale Deal
 france main ambani ko 1100 karod kaa karja tha, tab france sarkaar ne maaf kar diya
 Talking about Prime Minister Modi being involved in corruption, Navjot Singh Sidhu said that the Prime Minister again went to Sweden where Ambani was given the contract
 tab adani ne air force plane ke liye boli lagaai thi
 All these contracts were to be given to government companies, but this was not done
 anil ambani ko hawa se hawa main maarane vaala missile banane ke liye 65,000 karod kaa theka diya gaya, lekin diardio ko nahin diya gaya
 Navjot Singh Sidhu further said that he wants to ask Prime Minister Modi whether companies work for the country
 pradhanmantri jab bangladesh ke daure par gaye to 3,000 megawatt bijli kaa theka ambani or adani ko de diya gaya
 NTPC was not awarded this contract
 in thekon se ambani or adani kii donon companiyon ko agle 3 saal main 15,000 karod kaa munafa hoga
 Navjot Singh Sidhu said that Adani got the contract for the world's largest coal mine in Australia

 Contracts were also awarded to these companies in Mozambique, Oman, Myanmar, China

 uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ne guuruuvaar ko kendriya sadak evam parivahan mantri nitin gadakari se mulaaqaat kii
 Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and Nitin Gadkari on completing the project of Chardham All Weather Road within the stipulated time, construction of Haridwar and Dehradun ring road, construction of 22 roads of Uttarakhand on NH and construction of elevated road for traffic jams in Haridwar
 Talked
 donon netaaon ne enech 74 ke nirmaan ke bhrashtachar ke maamle main sibiai jaanch ke aadesh ko lekar bhi baatcheet kii
 In fact, on March 11, the then Chief Minister Harish Rawat government lodged an FIR against the officials and NHAI officials related to the case after the corruption case was acquired for the construction of NH 74 construction
 gadakari ne ravat ko likhaa tha letratrivendra singh ravat ne rajya kii satta sambhaalate hi is maamle ke sibiai jaanch ke aadesh de die the
 After the CBI inquiry order, Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari wrote a letter to Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on 5 April 2017 that the NHAI officials had any connection with the land acquisition corruption issue in NH 74 construction
 No, because the state government officials together collect the land and collect the state revenue department
 isamen enechaeai ke adhikariyon kaa koi role nahin hota he
 Therefore, the investigation in this case will affect the work of NHAI officials
 sutron kii maane to guuruuvaar ko uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ne is maamle main nitin gadakari ke daphtar main enechai ke adhikariyon se bhi baat kii
 NHAI officials briefed the Chief Minister on the entire case and told that this matter should be seen whether the investigation case is made on the officers of NHAI
 uttarakhand sarkaar is maamle main project ke liye bhoomi adhikaaran main hue karpshan par jaanch chaahati he
 The ministry says that NHAI does not acquire land for any of the national highway projects
 bhoomi adhigrahan kaa kaam district colector or revenue adhikari milakar karte hai, isliye agar karpshan kaa maamla banataa he to rajya str par banataa he
 The Ministry says that even after this, if the Government of Uttarakhand feels that the matter is in connivance with their officers, then CBI should be investigated, but they should not disturb the local police in the name of investigation, otherwise the officers will remain in the custody of the local police
 uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ne nitin gadakari or enechaeai ke adhikariyon se mulaaqaat ke baad kaha ki ham karpshan par zero tolerance niti par kaam karte hai
 He said that the decision to investigate the NH case will not be reconsidered, the culprits will be punished and will not be left out if any officer has committed corruption
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki gadakari ji kaa bhi yaheen kahana he ki koi bhi bhrashtachari ho, bachanaa nahin chahie
 He also said that NHAI officials have told him that his officers do not make a direct case in it
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki vah is puure maamle main kanoonee salaah lenge
 One thing is clear that this matter is becoming more of a nose question between Uttarakhand and the Union Road and Transport Ministry than corruption
 vipaksh aane vaale dino main is maamle main sawaal zarur khadey kar saktaa he

 Strike rate of 457 in this six minute innings
 14 rahaa
 Talking of an innings of more than 25 runs, Trion's strike rate has been seen for the first time in international cricket
 antarrashtriya cricket main sarvaadhik strike rate kii baat karen, to chloi trion purushon se bhi baaji maar gayi
 Dwayne Smith of the West Indies scored 29 runs in a 7-ball innings during the T20 match against Bangladesh in 2007 and his strike rate was 414
 28 kaa hi rahaa tha
 He then had 4 sixes and 1 four
 mashhoor statistician mohandas menon ke mutabik 14 farvari 2018 tak 4064 purushon ne interneshal cricket khelaa he
 Through this fact, it is proved that this innings of Cloy Trione is the biggest innings in world cricket in terms of strike rate

 haal tak 17 saal ke vabilsetty mohan abhayas hyderabad ke apane chote se ghar main garma-garam irani samosa banane main apni maa kii madad kiya karte the
 These fathers sell their samosas on the streets

 His goal is to become a scientist like his ideal former President APJ Abdul Kalam
 abhayas rojaanaa kisi bhi tarah samay nikaalkar 10 ghante kii padhai kiya karte the
 In his two-room house in Kukatpally area of hyderabad, where his parents, sister and grandmother are busy making samosas most of the time, it was not easy for him to concentrate and spend time for his studies
 is vajah se unhone apane skool or junior college main atirikt samay tak rukne ijaajat lee thi, taaki vah apni padhai puri kar saken
 After getting success in IIT JEE, Mohan Abhyas says that making samosa is a difficult task
 ham kyon itnaa dabaav jhelen? main bhavishya main ek vaigyanik bananaa chahta hum or apane maa-baap ko sukhi dekhnaa chahta hum

 The family moved to Hyderabad 13 years ago from a small village in Bhimavaram to provide good education to their son and daughter
 unki mehnat ab rang laai he
 Abhyas had secured the sixth position in the IIT Mains which is the stage before Advanced JEE
 abhayas haalanki antim pariksha parinaam se thode niraash hai
 He hoped that if not by 20, he would rank at least within 50
 unhone kaha ki main pehle thodaa niraash tha, lekin ab main apane pradarshan se khush hum
 Practices used to take 10 hours of study every day in any way
 hyderabad ke kuketapalli ilaake main apane do room ke ghar main jahaan, unke mata-pita, bahan or daadi adhiktar samay samose banane main vyast rahete hai, vahaan ekagrachitt hokar padhai ke liye samay nikaalnaa unke liye aasaan nahin hota tha
 Because of this, he had taken permission to stay in his school and junior college for extra time so that he could complete his studies
 iaiti jeii main safalataa paane ke baad mohan abhayas kehete hai ki samosa bananaa mushkil kaam he
 Why should we face so much pressure? i want to be a scientist in the future and want to see my parents happy
 tippaniyan His family's annual income is barely one lakh rupees
 lekin abhayas ke mata-pita kaa kahana he ki unke liye bachche kii padhai praathamikta he

 CP Joshi, the then president of the Rajasthan Congress wearing white kurta-pajama and currently the Union Minister for Surface Transport, prefers to speak in a strict but flattering manner

 Joshi, who is close to Rahul Gandhi, is a core team of some trusted and bureaucrats who always keep a close watch on the strengths and weaknesses of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and have secret meetings every fortnight
 
 mukhyamantri pad se maharoom hone kii vyathaa yada-kada unki jubaan se dard ke rup main chhalak hi padati he
 It was only a few months ago that during Gehlot's presence, he said without any hesitation that i was a follower of Ashok Gehlot earlier

 He said that no one knows where the government is
 unhone maujuuda sarkaar ko kuch puunjipatiyon kii sarkaar bataaya
 According to him, the government is playing in the hands of the capitalists and wants to take away the land of poor farmers and give it to the same capitalists, but the Congress party will not allow this to happen at any cost and the farmers' land will remain with the farmers
 is bich punjab sarkaar ne kisaanon ke muaavje ke liye 4 hajaar karod rupee muaavje kii raashi jari karne kaa faisla kiya he

 On this occasion, Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal said that we have made fast decisions in the telecom sector and that is why this auction is happening, although Sibal did not say how much the government asked the Supreme Court to delay the auction
 The bar has been scolded
 haal hi main court ne sarkaar se talkh lahaze main poocha tha ki vah simit spectrum kii nilaamee kyon kar rahi he
 Why the entire spectrum is not being auctioned

 raajnneeti main aane kaa makasad logon kii seva karnaa he
 He said, he has not come like a star in politics but like a common man
 camel hasan ne khud kii party ko tamilnadu main teesraa vikalp bataaya
 On the question of not going to parties like DMK and AIDMK, Kamal said, i am very hungry and if i have rotten fruit in front of me, i will not eat
 wo kya the (partiyaan) ye ahmiyat nahin rakhti par ab wo kya hai, ye mere liye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 On meeting the best leaders of vijayan-kejriwal and the alliance of any party in future, Kamal Haasan said, 'this is a matter of ideology
 main isamen sambhaavna jarur dekh rahaa hum par abhi maine kuch nishchit nahin kiya he
 Meeting with Left leaders Vijayan and Kejriwal and said on the question of alliance - Vijayan took Kerala to new heights
 vijayan or kejariwal mujhe pasand hai
 He said, he will also meet Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu
 koi party or koi naam bura nahin he
 Ideology and plan are two different things
 tamilnadu se baahar raajnneeti ke vistaar par kaha, pehle dekhte hai ham kya ( tamilnadu main) hasil karte hai
 Kamal Haasan also said, i do not believe in untouchability politics
 par bhrasht raajnneeti or aapraadhik pravriti ke saath samjhauta nahin karuunga
 No one can compromise for politics
 mere liye chunaav haarana badi cheez nahin he, lekin vichaardhaara se samjhauta bahut bada nuksaan he
 There is no problem in coming up with like-minded people
 jab padmaja joshi ne camel hasan se poocha ki DMK or AIADMK ke log aapako sun rahe honge, aap kya kahana chahenge unhen? hasan ne jawaab diya- sudhar jaaen

 notebandi ke baad privet sector kaa lone badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Due to which the banks have a double burden
 notebandi ke baad non baking finance companiyaan NBFC jaise IL&FS barbaad ho gayi
 a lot of cash reached banks after demonetisation
 bainkon ne IL&FS ko lone dena shuru kar diya
 Companies like IL&FS started lending to real estate
 or real estate main kya hua? kyonki logon ke paas flats kareedne ke paise nahin the to flats bike hi nahin
 As of June 2019, one million flats in 8 cities are unsold
 inaki keemat 8 lakh karod bataai jaati he
 So many flats are sold in four years
 lekin koi bika nahin he
 So the loan given to real state started sinking
 NBFC ne real state ko 5 lakh karod ke lone die hai
 Half the money has been bad loan
 yani dub gaya he
 Obviously, the burden will fall on the banks
 jo bank ubarne ja rahe the ve ab or doobane lage hai
 So he stopped lending to NBFC
 jinase chote va majhole udyog lone lete the
 They stopped getting money
 is saal ke pehle chah maheene main bainkon ne kareeb kareeb na ke baraabar lone diya
 So the economy stopped
 arvind or felman kaa kahana he ki bharat main 1991 main bhayankar sankat aayaa tha

 The economy has reached the ICU

 They are still on the streets but they are all forgotten now
 unka paisa dub gaya he
 When you also drown, then such people will remain silent as if you are silent today
 agast se lekar november tak bharat kaa niryaat gira he
 Leather, Gems, Readymade Garment
 sabakaa niryaat negative main he
 Obviously, this would have had an impact on low-earning employees
 unki naukariyaan ja rahi hongi
 To complicate this section, the agenda of Hindu Muslim is being jammed
 kyonki yah taapic vaaki logon ko uljhaata he
 People spend hours arguing
 puraa din nikal jaataa he
 Not only this, imports have also started declining
 is tarah patan kaa ek chakra ban gaya he
 This has resulted in GST collection
 centre sarkaar rajyon ko bakaayaa raashi nahin de paa rahi he
 The law is that if the tax collection of the states does not increase at the rate of 14 percent, then the central government will pay as much as it does not increase
 is tarah rajyon kaa centre sarkaar par 50,000 karod kaa bakaayaa ho gaya he
 If this money does not reach the states, then the speed of their car will be slow
 rajya apana hissaa maang rahe hai
 They are saying that they will go to the Supreme Court
 yaa ji es tii council kii baithak main jaakar baahar nikal aaenge
 The government, on the other hand, is looking to increase GST on what it can increase the GST rates
 jisti daron ke slab main kya kya badlaav ho sakate hai
 Meanwhile, the government has increased the prices of 21 medicines by up to 50 percent
 aaf jaanate hai ki bharat kii shahari or gramin aabaadi kaa 15 pratishat hissaa bhi swasthya beemaa ke daayre main nahin aata he
 Needless to say that every family is spending 10 to 25 percent of their income on health
 jiske kaaran vah garib he to garibi rekha se neeche chalaa jaataa he or madhyam varg kaa he to garibi rekha par aa jaataa he
 The government has no money
 zaahir he sarkaar apana sansaadhan bechegi
 The same is happening in the power sector
 petroleum sector main bhi yahi ho rahaa he
 1
5 million employees of the power sector are now awake
 abhi tak ve tivi ke failaae agenda main mast the
 Even today, most Hindus will not spend half of their share in the Muslim debate
 khayr ab jab ye 8 janvari ko hadtaal karenge to dekh lenge ki 15 lakh hokar bhi inaki keemat shunya ho gai he
 i have said many times
 bharat kaa loktantr badal gaya he
 This number is no longer important
 har sankhya duusare bade samooh se khaarij ho jaati he
 The Prime Minister of the country points towards the clothes of the protesters
 zaahir he unka iraadaa yahi he
 You will not feel wrong because the Prime Minister has no option
 magar antaratma bachi hoti to jharkhand chunaav main die gaye unke bayaan kaa matlab aasaani se samaj lete

 Former Chak De India fame player Miranjan Negi said that there is so much dirty politics happening in Hockey India that even if the team reaches the semi-finals of the World Cup in such an environment, it will be nothing short of a miracle
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen mejabaan hone kaa koi laabh nahin mil rahaa
 The ground is not ready and players are unable to pay attention to the preparations due to lack of payment
 ’ unhone kaha ki team kaa manobal gira hua he or isamen vijeta vaale tevar najar hi nahin aa rahe
 At the same time, he also accused him of not taking seriously a big tournament like World Cup
 vahiin ioe kii tadarth chayan samiti ke purv adhyaksh rahe olympian asalam sher khan ne kaha ki vah team antim chaar main kaise pahonchegi, jisaki koi khariyat poochne vaala hi nahin he
 Aslam said, 'it seems that Hockey India means more than gaining power in the election, not the performance of the team
 uskaa lakshya padon par kabja karnaa he, padakon par nahin
 In such an environment it is meaningless to expect a good performance from the team in the World Cup
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘hockey india ke gathan ke samay yadi sahi haathon main kaman saunpi jaati to yah bhartiya hockey ke liye nirnaayak mode ho saktaa tha lekin sattarum logon kii niyat main khot he
 He means neither to sports nor to players
 ’ purv olympian pargat singh ne kaha ki hockey india kii kerani kaa anjaam khilaadiyon ko bhugatna pad rahaa he

 pradeshik icaayiyon ko manyata dene ke maamle main manamaani kar rahi he or in tamaam jhanjhawaton main vishwa cap tathaa team kii taiyaariyaan haashiye par chali gai he
 Pargat said that it will definitely have an impact on preparations
 unhone kaha ki hockey india ko chaiye ki niyamon ke tahat chunaav kii aupchaariktaayen jaldi puri karke vishwa cap kii taiyaari par dhyaan de
 Negi also said that due to the wrong decisions of Hockey India, the team could not get the best coach
 unhone kaha, ‘jose brasa duniya ke behtareen kochon main se nahin he lekin unke aane se fark padaa he
 In such a situation, if we had a great coach like Rick Charlesworth, then India could be included in the top teams but the hockey rules did not improve it
 ’ purv olympian or coach balajit singh saini ne kaha ki 28 farvari se shuru ho rahe vishwa cap se pehle chaar deshon kaa toornament radd hona bahut bada jhatka tha kyonki bharat ne abhi tak badi tiimon ke khilaaf apana akalan nahin kiya he
 He said, 'treading the weak teams does not reveal the preparations
 hamen holland yaa austrailia jaisi tiimon se khelnaa chaiye tha lekin chaar deshon kaa toornament radd ho gaya jo taiyaariyon ke liye bada jhatka he
 Hockey India says that the tournament was canceled due to non-clearance from FIH, while FIH is requesting the pitch not to be prepared
 bhartiya kochon ne janvari ke aakhir se abhyaas ke liye neshnal stadium maanga he lekin uske farvari se pehle taiyaar hone ke asaar najar nahin aa rahe lihaaja bhartiya team ko mejabaan hone kaa adhik phayda haaki ke is mahasamar main miltaa nahin dikhataa

 Be it a record partnership at the school level with his Balsakha Vinod Kambli or the first double century in one-day cricket, February 24 was considered a lucky day for Sachin Tendulkar, but it did not happen today in the first Test match against Australia in Chennai
 
 tendulkar test cricket main pichley teen saal se adhik samay se shatak nahin laga paae hai
 At the MA Chidambaram Stadium, he was in a position to end the wait, but then Nathan Lyon took the edge of his bat and got into the wickets
 tendulkar 81 ran banaakar out ho gaye or is baar 24 farvari unka saath nahin de pai
 He set a new world record 25 years ago on February 24, 1988, by partnering 664 with Kambli while playing for Mumbai's Shardashram Vidyamandir School
 iske 22 saal baad 24 farvari, 2010 ko dakshin africa ke khilaaf gwalior main tendulkar ne phir se nayaa itihaas rachaa
 He became the first batsman to score a double century in one-day international cricket
 tendulkar puure 50 over tak krij par tike rahe or unhone naabad 200 ran banaae the
 The comments baharhaal, chennai test main tendulkar shatak se chook gaye, lekin iske baavjood vah ek nayaa record apane naam karne main safal rahe
 He has now become the most frequently dismissed batsman in Tests between 80 and 89
 yah 12waan avasar he, jabaki tendulkar 80 or 89 ke bich out hokar pavilion laute
 Australia's Alan Border, England's Mike Atherton and India's Rahul Dravid have been out 11–11 times
 tendulkar chennai kii is pari main bhi bold hue
 He has been bowled 54 times in Test matches
 unhone border (53 baar bold) ko peeche choda
 Now only Dravid (55 times bold) is ahead of Sachin in this matter
 pichhali 18 pariyon main tendulkar aath baar bold ho chuke hai
 Tendulkar has not been able to score a century in Test cricket for more than three years
 eme chidambaram stadium main vah is intjaar ko samaapt karne kii sthiti main dikh rahe the, lekin tabhi nathan leone kii gend unke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar viketon main samaa gai
 Tendulkar was dismissed by scoring 81 runs and this time on 24 February he could not support him
 unhone thik 25 saal pehle 24 farvari, 1988 ko mumbai ke sharadashram vidyamandir skool kii taraf se khelte hue kambli ke saath 664 ran kii saajhedaari karke nayaa vishwa record banaaya tha
 After 22 years, on 24 February 2010, Tendulkar again created new history against South Africa in Gwalior
 vah ek-divasiy antarrashtriya cricket main doharaa shatak jadne vaale pehle ballebaaj bane

 It is being debated not only in India but in many countries of the world and pilot projects are also being run from time to time

 In the second pilot, which ran for 12 months, two similar tribal villages were chosen

 Beneficiary families had more livestock, which improved health and financial stability

 The villages receiving cash transfers had higher expenditure on schooling and agriculture

 The conclusion stated that Universal Basic Income had some concerns that this work would discourage labor and increase alcohol consumption
 haalanki, nakad praptakartaaon ke paas shram or kaam kii ucch dar thi
 There was also no evidence of higher alcohol consumption in the beneficiary villages than in other villages, but in the tribal villages, consumption of alcohol decreased

 With this, the financial stability of these villages was greatly improved

 On the one hand, expensive advertisements are given on newspapers and TV channels by the government, on the occasion of Environment Day, on the other hand it does not implement them on its own
 aisa hi kuch kiya dilli sarkaar ne
 Every year the state governments insist on not using plastic on the occasion of Environment Day on 5 June and through advertisements, it also gives a message of awareness among the people, but the surprising truth is that the plastic which is the most polluting environment in the government celebrates Used indiscriminately
 iftaar party main plastic kaa istemalkuch aisi hi tasviir dikhiparyavarandiwas kii purvasandhya par mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii ore se yojit iftaar party main, jahaan plastic saamaanon kaa jamkar istemaal kiya gaya
 Through an advertisement in newspapers on Environment Day, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal advised the public to use earthen ax in social and public functions and they themselves did not implement it
 apni apil ke jariye mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal 'beet plastic polyushan' kaa naaraa buland kar rahe hai to vahiin vishwa paryaavaran diwas kii purvasandhya par yojit iftaar party main aam aadmi party sarkaar plastic kii botalon ke saath najar ai
 Apart from Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, Environment Minister Emraan Hussain, many ministers and party leaders were present at the event, but no minister or leader appeared to object to the plastic bottle
 aapako bataa den kinational green tribunel(engiti) ne bhi 10 agast 2017 ko aadesh jari karte hue 50 microne se kam kii plastic kii theliyon ke istemaal par pratibandh laga rakhaa he
 Also, a penalty of 5 thousand rupees for using plastic bags is also included in this order
 kejariwal kii janata se apilhalanki vigyaapan ke jariye kejariwal ne plastic pradooshan se judi 3 badi apil janata se kii1, shahari ilaakon main aawaara ghoomane vaale pashu aksar kooda khate hue paae jate he jiske saath pashu plastic kii theliyaan bhi kha jate hai jo unke liye ghaatak siddh ho sakati he
 2, Do not reuse disposable plastic and plastic bags once used
 3, vikalp ke taur par kapade, jute yaa kaagaj se bane thilon kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 Keeping the water bottle with you when exiting the house will reduce the waste of plastic bottles
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki iftaar party hi nahin anya sarkari aayojanon main bhi baari sankhya main pani ke plastic botalon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Disposing of these plastics is extremely difficult, despite this, governments do not seem to be taking any concrete steps to tackle plastics and implement their own appeal

 yun to indian premier lig (ipel) kaa naata vivaadon se rahaa he, lekin mangalvaar ko gujarat liance brandan maikulam ne maidan main aisa kaam kiya, jise dekhakar kaha ja saktaa he ki cricket ko abhi bhi jentalman khel kaha janaa jaij he
 Former New Zealand captain and Gujarat Lions player mccullum gave a wonderful introduction to the game spirit against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) on Tuesday in the 20th match of the 2017 IPL
 maikulam kii is khel bhaavana se virdohi team aaarasibi ke captain viraat kohli bhi prabhavit hue
 The RCB captain shook hands with mccullum and patted him on the shoulder and congratulated him for giving a display of sportsmanship
 darasal, mangalvaar ko match ke dauraan aaarasibi ke kris gail dhuandhar batting kar rahe the
 Captain Suresh Raina was constantly planning to dismiss him
 isi bich maikulam ne aaarasibi ke visphotak openar kris gail kaa boundry line par mushkil kaich lapka
 mccullum was then on long off and after catching the catch, he started celebrating with his teammates
 magar maikulam ko ahsaas hua ki unka yah kaich sahi nahin he, kyonki unhen apni topi boundry line par chune kaa andeh tha
 mccullum ran to the umpire and requested him to take a decision after watching the replay
 VIDEO: 1 xxrep 4 0 T20I runs for @henrygayle
 That is some T20 domination https: / / t
 co / kfysxsfdko - @rcbtweets # IPL - indianpremierleague (@IPL) April 18, 2017 riple ke saaf dikhaa ki maikulam ne behtareen kaich to nishchit hi lapka, lekin unki topi vaaki boundry line par tach ho chuki thi
 The umpire changed his decision and Chris Gayle was called to bat again
 iske baad kris gail 77 ranon kii pari khelkar out hue
 That is, mccullum's sportsmanship caused a loss to his team
 phir unke is bhaavana kii jitani tarif kii jaae kam he
 Actually, rcb's Chris Gayle was batting during the match on Tuesday
 captain suresh raina unhen out karne ke liye lagaataar planning karte dikhe
 Meanwhile, mccullum took a hard catch of rcb's explosive opener Chris Gayle at the boundary line
 maikulam tab long of par mustaid the or is kaich ko lapakane ke baad vah apni team ke saathiyon ke saath jashn manaane lage
 But mccullum realized that his catch was not right, as he was suspected of touching his hat on the boundary line
 maikulam ampire ke paas daudte hue gaye or unase riple dekhne ke baad faisla lene kii guzarish kii

 co / kfysxsfdko - @ rcbtweets # IPL — indianpremierleague (@IPL) April 18, 2017 The replay clearly showed that mccullum certainly took a great catch, but his hat really touched the boundary line
 ampire ne apana faisla badla or kris gail ko dobaaraa ballebaaji karne ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 Chris Gayle was then dismissed for 77 runs
 yani maikulam kii khel bhaavana ke chalate unki team ko nuksaan hua
 Then this sentiment is less to be praised

 co / kfysxsfdko - @rcbtweets # IPL In the cooperative banks of Chhattisgarh, during the demonetization, in just five days, 247 crore rupees were deposited in various accounts, whose money was it? Where it came from and whose account was transferred, it has not been disclosed yet
 bank ne RTI ke tahat lagbhag dedh saal baad jamaa rakam kaa byora diya, lekin gopneeyata kaa hawala dekar khatedaaron ke naam or pataa thikaana dene se inkaar kar diya
 The amount of information received by the bank from the RTI is quite doubtful
 congress ne sahakaari bank ke lenden kii ucchstareey jaanch kii maang kii he
 It is alleged that it is black money, which went white into the vault of the cashiers
 RTI se yah khulaasa hua he ki notebandi ke dauraan das november 2016 se 14 november 2016 ke bich arthath sirf paanch dinon menraipur, dhamtari, rajanandgaanv, durg, bilaspur, ambikapur or jagadalpur main sthit sahakaari bainko kii shakhaon main 247 karod rupaye jamaa kiye gaye
 It is worth mentioning that on 8 November 2016, Ratanotbandi was implemented
 is dauraan bainkon main puraane note jamaa karaane waalon kaa tantaa laga hua tha
 The customers of cooperative banks are usually farmers
 kisaanon ke paas sookhe ke halaat ke chalate itani badi rakam nahin thi ki ve maatr paanch dinon ke bheetar 247 karod rupaye jamaa kar pate
 It has also been revealed from the RTI that between November 10, 2016 to December 31, 2016, old notes worth Rs 32 crore 52 lakh were deposited in the branches of the cooperative bank of the state
 achaanak sahakaari bainkon main itani adhik rakam kahaan se aa gai yah aaj bhi sochane kaa vishay bana hua he
 While the co-operative banks are pressurizing the farmers to recover loans due to their poor financial condition
 bank main 247 karod kii rakam kis madhyam se pahunchi, yah rakam kiski he or inke khate kab khole gaye? in tamaam sawaalon ko lekar congress jaanch kii maang kar rahi he
 The details of the amount deposited in the branches of cooperative banks in just five days are as follows
 bilaspur main 50 karod 29 lakh, durg main 56 karod 96 lakh, ambikapur main 10 karod 88 lakh, jagadalpur main 29 karod 35 lakh, raipur main 60 karod 64 lakh or rajanandgaanv main 48 karod 77 lakh rupaye jamaa kiye gaye
 The role of the opposition bank is being questioned
 uskaa aarope he ki sarkari sangrakshan milane ke chalate sahakaari bank blike mani ko white mani main tabdeel karne ke kaarkaane ban gaye hai
 Their customers are also not being investigated under the rules
 congress ke netaa or chhattisgarh prabharee pi
 L
 puniya ne elaan kiya he ki congress satta main ai to blike mani khapaane waalon ko jail bhejegi
 Cooperative bank farming in Chhattisgarh is like a backbone for farmers
 aamtaur par kisaanon ko krishi rin, khaadya beej, or krishi upkarnon ke liye inase badi sahaayta milti he
 Many agricultural schemes of the central and state government are operated through these banks
 rajya bhar main 80 lakh se zyada kisaanon ke sahakaari bainko main khate hai
 Co-operative banks also operate under RBI policy
 gambhir baat yah he ki sahakaari bainkon ne notebandi ke dauraan jamaa rakam kaa byoraa dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 In this case, all the RTI applications were rejected by the cooperative banks citing confidentiality, but when the complainants appealed to the information commission, the cooperative banks gave information about the amount deposited during the demonetisation but very limited
 usne khatedaaron ke pate thikaane or jamaa rakam kaa byoraa chipa liya
 At present, the matter has caught hold of the matter
 khatedaaron kii pahchaan or bank kii karypranali ko lekar congress sarkaar ko gherne main juty hui he
 For this, he has started a sit-in demonstration in many districts
 uskaa aarope saafe he ki yah rakam rajya ke sattadhari netaaon kii he
 That is why the bank is held hostage to the RTI Act

 vanade siries main zimbabwe kaa supada saaf karne ke baad rahane kii sena tii-20 siries main bhi apana dabadabaa banaae rakhana chaahegi
 Given the way in which Zimbabwe's performance has fallen after giving a tough competition in the first match of the ODI series, Team India's victory is being considered easy
 ab tak aasaan rahaa he daurapahele vanade main kareebi antar se jeet ke baad bharat ne jald hi apane khel main sudhaar kiya or agle donon maichon main zimbabwe par aasaani se jeet darj kii
 Zimbabwe had a good chance of winning in the first ODI but could not take advantage of it
 baaki donon maichon main bhi uski team ne kuch avasaron par bharat ko kadi chunauti di thi
 His team will take inspiration from this performance and try to show positive game in T20 matches
 ajey rahane kii koshish karegaa bharatdusri taraf bharat kii nigaah daure main ajey rahane par tiki hai

 mujhe lagata he ki yahaan hamane match main antar paidaa kiya
 If you talk about batting India, then they will have to show more aggressive game

 But in a T20 where the entire map is overturned inside a ball, this kind of performance can be overshadowed by the team
 bhartiya ballebaajon ke liye yah ek tarah se chunauti he kyonki zimbabwe ke gendbaajon ne acha pradarshan karke unhen khulkar khilne kaa mauka nahin diya
