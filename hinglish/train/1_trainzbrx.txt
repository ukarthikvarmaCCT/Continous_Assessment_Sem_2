 The point is that the selectors should talk to the player when he is not removed from the team

 But according to sources, the names of candidates from Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Gujarat will not be announced yet

 It is reported that Narendra Modi may contest from two seats
 inamen ek seat gujarat se or duusari uttar pradesh kii varanasi ho sakati he
 If sources are to be believed, Modi himself is keen to contest elections from Gujarat and UP
 aise halaat main varanasi ke maujuuda saansad murali manohar joshi ko kanpur se party kaa tikat diya ja saktaa he
 At the same time, from Patna Sahib seat, the party is considering the names of Shatrughan Sinha and Ravi Shankar Prasad

 yahaan purv kendriya mantri or rashtravaadi congress party (NCP) ke netaa sharad pavaar kii profile ke saath kisi ne chhedchhad kii or unhen desh kaa sabase bhrasht netaa bataa diya
 Actually, Sharad Pawar's Wikipedia profile was tampered with through a fake account
 pehle unki profile main unhen desh kaa sabase bhrasht netaa bataaya gaya, phir baad main badal kar unhen desh kaa sabase vafaadaar netaa bataaya gaya
 However, this screenshot of this information from Wikipedia was corrected after it went viral
 gauratlab he ki vikipedia par koi bhi vyakti apana acount banaakar kisi bhi jaankaree ko apadet kar saktaa he
 There have been many times before when the profile of a big celebrity has been tampered with
 abhi kuch din pehle hi ensipi ke anya netaa ranjit singh mohite patil kii profile ke saath bhi aise hua tha, jab unhen ek saath hi teen partiyon kaa netaa dikhaaya ja rahaa tha
 Let us tell you that Sharad Pawar's party NCP has an alliance with Congress in Maharashtra
 maharashtra kii 48 loksabhaa siton par NCP 22 or congress 26 siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 Both parties will have to give seats to smaller allies from within their quota
 NCP pramukh sharad pavaar is baar loksabhaa chunaav nahin lard rahe hai
 Maharashtra has four Lok Sabha elections
 48 siton par 11, 18, 23 or 29 april ko vot daale jaaenge
 Chambal 
 
 ye wo naam he jiskaa zikr aate hi ankhon ke saamne daakuon kii tasviir tairne lagati he
 Spread over hundreds of miles in the borders of three states, it is a rugged one, due to which many bloody stories are known in the world of crime
 kehete hai ki chambal ke pani kii taasir hi kuch aisi he ki logon ko baghawat kaa paracham buland karne or haathon main bandook uthaane ke liye majaboor kar detaa he
 But nowadays Chambal is suddenly empty
 jaanate hai kyon? kyonki chunaav aa gaya he
 Rugged mounds of coarse soil
 ghani katili jhaadiyaan or bal khaati nadi
 Yes, it is Chambal
 vahi chambal jiskaa sirf naam jubaan par aate hi achche-acchon ke paseene chhot jate hai
 Jehan swims at the dreaded den of robber and bandits
 naa jane chambal keis behad ke kis kone main koun daaku chupa ho? naa jane kab kidar se achaanak goliyaan barasane lage? aam to aam insaan
 
 
 The police themselves also seek refuge from entering Chambal without a platoon
 madhya pradesh, rajasthan or uttar pradesh kii simaaon main samaai main chambal kii ghati pichley kai sau saalon se samaaj or kanoon ke liye sir dard bani hui he
 Chambal's post office is busy these days in the election campaign of parties
 jaanate hai kyon? kyonki chambal par raaj karne vaale daaku philhal desh par raaj karne vaali agali sarkaar kaa bhavishya tay karne kii muhim main jute hue hai
 Now you must be wondering, what is the deal with the election of the Chambal bandits? So on the chessboard of politics, the bandits of today have also become the pawns of the Khaddaris
 darasal chambal ke daaku raajnneetik partiyon se paise lekar jor-shor se unke chunavi prachaar main jute hue hai
 And that's why he has distanced himself from his real profession till the election
 daakuon kaa siyasat se koi nayaa rishta nahinvaise chambal ke daakuon kaa siyasat se koi nayaa rishta nahin he
 The bullying of the Chambal bandits has always been heard in elections
 darasal siyaasi partiyon kii matadaataaon se jahaan daal nahin galati vahaan wo takat or dehshat kaa sahaara lete hai
 About a month before the election, at the behest of the leaders, the robber of Chambal issues the name of the candidates in their respective areas
 phir bhala kiski himmat he jo bullate ke saamne ballat par bharosa kare
 The amount of money the dacoits get in return for a month of election campaign is more than the risk of dacoity
 chambal banane kii kahani kii jad main hi siyasatvaise chambal ke kukhyat chambal banane kii kahani kii jad main hi siyasat he
 About one and a half thousand years ago, the people of this region started their first operation as rebels from Chambal against the rule of the Greek Emperor Alexander
 bas tabhi se chambal baagiyon kaa baseraa ban gaya
 After this, whenever the rebellion against the rule was raised, the rebels turned to Chambal
 yahaan aapako bataaenge ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main chambal or chambal ke daaku kya bhoomika nibhaane ja rahe hai
 Who is threatening whom, who is winning and who is beating whom? Chambal has a very old and deep relationship with politics
 aisa koi chunaav nahin hua he jisamen chambal ke daakuon ne hissaa naa liya ho
 Whether by contesting the election itself or by issuing a decree in support or opposition of the candidates who have entered the electoral fray
 or is baar phir tasviir waisi hi he
 The entire country is undoubtedly overwhelmed by the biggest festival of democracy, ie the noise of elections, but there is silence in daylight also in the daylight apart from the whole country in Navganwa village of Banda district of Bundelkhand area
 gaanv main naa to bujurgon kii chaoupal lagati hai or naa hi khuleam bachche khelte hai, kyonki chunaav ke is daur main ilaaka dehshat ke saaye main jeene ko majaboor he
 As the election date draws near, the lives of the people here are becoming hell 
 lalaram navganva gaanv ke pradhan hai
 He says - 'I had received a threat asking for money twice, where we have no money
 mali kii pakad hui he
 They carry the children
 lalaram par 20 bigha jameen se 40 logon kaa parivaar paalane kii jimmedaari he
 But the truth is that every coming noise scares the family as well as them
 lalaram ki rishtedaar prabhavati ne rote hue kaha - 'dar lagata he, fasal khadi he, khet sab aise hi pade hai, aage kaa rasta nahin, ladkaa baccha ghar main chupa kar rakhte he
 Lalaram's wife Rajkumari cried and said - 'we work the day, then after four o'clock we cannot go out
 bathroom bhi nahin ja sakate
 This is not the story of just one village but the reality of the whole area
 bundelkhand kaa behad ek baar phir dakaiton kii panaahagaar ban gaya he
 From Madhya Pradesh to Uttar Pradesh, 13 districts like Satna, Chitrakoot, Mahoba, Hamirpur and Banda have reported dacoits
 banda ke naroni main kalam kii lakiron main apni jindagi talash rahe dayaram ko dar he ki kahin jindagi kii lakeer choti na pad jaae
 Dayaram, who started a shop in Navagawa by taking a loan, is experiencing an election season
 banda main naraini blaak ke dayaram ne kaha - mujhe bolaa paisa do kaartoos kharidni he, 20 hajaar rupee maange mujhase, mere paas kahaan he
 There is a crook named Sangram, coming daily in the paper, then i get a call, i will cut my head and kill your child, we run away, who will go to vote, they are doing this for the election
 'darasal ilaake kii garibi hi puure bundelkhand ilaake kii badanasibi he or isi badanasibi ne unhen dehshat ke saaye main jeene ko majaboor kiya he
 Annadata of Bundelkhand, who craves for every drop of water, is in the name of God of Indra, but during the election season, such banners in the village pull the worry on everyone's face
 maayusi ke alam main logon ne ab chunaav kaa bahishkaar karne kii kasame khai he
 Even some people have expressed their intention to commit mass self-immolation
 raaj bahadur ne kaha - meri beti kii shaadi roak di he 2 may ko thi vot nahi daalenge
 Jairam said - All leaders are the same, after the election, all of us will commit collective self-immolation
 '1970 ke dashak main bundelkhand main dakaiton ne aatank kii chaabuk chalaai, gaya kurmi, dadua or thokia ke julmon ne bundelkhand kii darakati ummiido ko raundne kaa kaam kiya
 Now once again the story of yesterday has returned to haunt the villagers
 logon ke chahare bhi ab dukh jhelane ke aadi hai, in ankhon main na to sapane hai or naa koi umang
 And in this election season, not a single voice was heard by them that could overcome their miseries
 peedit kii beti rubina kahati hai - badmaashon ne paise maange the
 Father did not have the money
 yahi soch-soch ke mar gaye
 Rubina's grandfather said - upset
 badmaashon kaa dar chote chote bacchon par he
 As the owner wishes
 fasal bhi barbaad ho gai
 Alam is that the area of bundelkhand is dominated by dozens of gangs like Balkhadia
 or aise hi giroh kii aad main siyaasi dal apni rajnatik rotiyaan senk rahe hai
 Bundelkhand was also the eyes of a politician at some time
 bade charche the in fakiron ke jitani badi badanasibi utani badi hasti chamakati thi choukhat par inke , kabhi rahul ki rahamat or kabhi akhilesh kaa daan
 Lightning flashed like this, so fate has written that neither their bad luck will end or their failure
 ummidavaaron ko jitaane ke liye alag-alag hatkandechunavi mausam aate hi chambal ke behad main bhi halchal tej ho jaati he
 Here, gangs of different bandits along with candidates from different parties adopt different tactics to win their candidates
 or inamen sabase asardaar tarika he khoff kaa
 Here the decrees more than electoral slogans affect the decree that comes out of the guns of these bandits
 30 april ko bundelkhand kii chaar loksabhaa siton par votingpure desh kii tarah hi uttar pradesh ke bundelkhand main bhi chunavi shatranj kii bisaat bich chuki he or 30 april ko bundelkhand kii chaar loksabhaa siton banda, jhaansi, jalon or hamirpur main vot daale jane hai
 But believe me, the journey of Banda Lok Sabha seat, one of the four parliamentary seats, is not so easy
 yahaan se satta ke galiyaaron kaa rasta sangeenon ke saae se hokar guzarataa he
 Actually even today the bandits are heard in this area
 banda kii jamini haqiqat ye he ki chunaav aate hi behad ke daakuon ke giroh apane-apane ummidavaaron ko chunaav jitaane ke liye maidan main utar padate hai
 In Bundelkhand, dacoits spread their empire for many decades
 lekin 1978 main shiv kumaar patel urf dadua ne ilaake kii raajnneeti main dakhal dena shuru kar diya or bas usee vakt se ye silsilaa badastoor chalaa aa rahaa he
 But in 2007, during the Mayawati government, up's Special Task Force killed Dadua and in the next year i
e
 2008, another dreaded thief of the area was also killed
 lekin 6 saal ke baad halaat ek baar phir se bekaabu hote najar aa rahe hai or isaki sabase badi vajah he ilaake ke dakaiton ke wo giroh jo apane-apane ummidavaaron kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 And the biggest name among them is Sudesh Patel alias Balkhadia with a reward of five lakhs
 aaj bundelkhand main balkhadia jaise darjanon girohon ke hausale buland hai
 That is because they have got patronage of different political parties
 yahi vajah he ki ek vakt tha jab kukhyat dakait dadua ne ye farmaan jari kiya tha
 The elephant will be stamped
 
 
 varanaa goli padegi chaati par or naak milegi ghati main
 
 
 Today, RK Patel, a fellow of the same Dadua, is a BSP candidate from Banda, who had earlier won the election on a Samajwadi Party ticket
 sapa ne unke khilaaf dadua ke bhai bal kumaar patel ko tikat diya he
 Both have dozens of cases like attempt to murder, assault, extortion and protection of dacoits and both are accusing each other of spreading terror
 baand ke bispi ummidavaar aar ke patel ne kaha - banda ke log aman chaahate hai sapa ne bhay kaa vaataavaran paidaa kiya, unke log daraa dhamka rahe he, maa betiyaan ghar se baahar nahin ja paati hai
 Bal Kumar Patel, SP candidate from Banda said - There is no legacy of Dadua, which is the guidance of Mulayam Singh, these who are RK Patel, get their call details all cleared, this is a conspiracy to trap us
 bundelkhand kii siyasat par bandook kii raajnneeti havibundelkhand kii siyasat par bandook ki raajnneeti haaavee rahi he
 The dacoits have been patronized by political parties
 dadua ke do rishtedaar aamane saamne he donon hi ek duusare ko kos rahe hai or donon hi jab chaahe partiyaan badalte rahe hai
 This means that as long as democracy remains bound in the shackles of fear, the mockery of elections will continue to fly
 aaj bhi yahi lagata he ki banda main kuch bhi nahin badla
 The knock of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections has once again brought a panic message for the people here

 He said that a sovereign nation in the matter should be criticized in a language that is in accordance with the dignity of another country, a nation from which another nation is born
 salve ne kaha, ‘is adaalat main aire-gaire ke liye jagah nahin he
 'the table is beating Pakistan,' said Salve, 'when you are legally strong then you keep things legally, when you are strong with facts, you keep things factually and when you don't have both, you Beat the table

 Two things are discussed in the midst of midday silence at the 24, Akbar Road Congress headquarters, which are in full swing in power
 sonia or rahul arase se aae nahin hai
 In the name of the general secretaries, it is hardly visible to have one or more general secretaries together in the headquarters at a time
 sachivon ke darshan bhi kam hi hote hai
 Nowadays, usually the media department seems to be active, without which the party may look very cold
 rahul netaaon secongress mukhyalayamen shaayad milanaa pasand nahin karte hai

 ab bhala upi chunaav kii baari haar ke baad jab sonia-rahul congress mukhyalay nahin aae, to bhala karyaalay kii khamoshi kaa andaaza lagaana zyaada mushkil nahin he
 In fact, Congress leaders have also been troubled by the election defeat, election reshuffle among leaders leaving the party resentful of Rahul, and Rahul's coronation
 netaa soch rahe hai ki, aakhir rahul kii nai team kab banegi, banegi to usamen unki jagah hogi yaa nahin, or tab kya party ek baar phir ubharegi
 In this turmoil, the leaders in the organization remain just those who have been given the work and are doing what is necessary
 lekin apane man se koi nai shuruuaat nahin karata dikhataa, koi zyaada tej chalanaa nahin chahta he
 After all, the condition of the party is bad, the future changes from above have made the leaders restless
 aise halaat mencongress daftaramen kaam karne vaala staff hi he jo roj mukhyalay aata he
 But mutual discussion is only about two things
 aapas main bhi vahiin charchaa karte hai or agar koi jaankaree lene aae patrkaar se mukhaatib hue to bhi wo do baaten to kar hi lete hai
 Let me tell you, what are those two things, first- something will happen in the party, when will it happen, and second- who is going to leave now, or not ours
 aakhir ho bhi kyon naa, aisa lagata he jis jagah chunaav aata he vahaan party chunaav lard leti he
 But the long term plan is not visible yet, the organization has been cold
 kya hoga, kab hoga ,kisi ko koi andaja nahin
 Frequent electoral defeat from above

 But after a few hours, he took a U-turn and said that his account was hacked
 jediu ke pravaktaa rajeev ranjan kaa kahana he ki tej pratap kisi naa kisi bahaane media main bane rahane ke jugad main lage rahete hai
 There is a sense of insecurity in them
 kyonki unke chote bhai ko parivaar main zyada mahatv mila, raajnneeti main bhi badi haisiyat he
 That's why that frustration is inside them
 rajeev ranjan ne kaha, aise bayanon ke jariye vah us kuntha ko jaahir bhi karte rahe hai
 Therefore, our party is neither interested in their 'no entry' nor in removing their 'no entry'
 isliye ki ab rashtriya janata dal (argedy) kii haalat acchhee nahin he
 After the exit of Nitish Kumar, the Grand Alliance has now survived the RJD
 is bandhan se congress ke andar bhi kahin naa kahin chatapataahat he
 No matter how much he tries, he will not be able to trick the public
 rajeev ranjan ne kaha, agar tej pratap ko lagata he ki unka acount hack hua he to unhen sibar krime ke tahat shikaayat kerani chahie
 It will be investigated and if it is true then whoever is the culprit will be caught
 lekin hamaara yah maananaa he ki yah jhooth he
 To mislead people, they are talking about hacking the account

 This is not the only case against Gurmeet Ram Rahim, convicted in the Sadhvi sexual abuse case
 un par kai aarope log chuke hai
 Gurmeet Ram Rahim is also to appear in the Magistrate Court of Jaipur on 7 September in one such criminal case 
 darasal, gurmeet par ek vyakti kii patni ko gaayab karne kaa aarope he
 Yes, a case is also registered against Ram Rahim in Jaipur
 5 may 2015 ko kamalesh naam ke ek vyakti ne court main pariwaad darj kiya tha
 In the complaint, he told that he and his wife Ram used to go to Rahim's Sirsa Ashram
 lekin vahaan par uski patni ko kaid kar liya gaya he
 The court had asked the Jawahar Nagar police station in Jaipur to file a case and present it to his wife
 8 may 2015 ko jawahar nagar thane main ram rahim ke khilaaf exiaar darj karavaaya gaya tha
 In which the police have not been able to investigate till now
 police ne apane progress report main jawaab likhaa he kibaba ke deraa main jane kii anumatinhee mil paa rahi he
 Several criminal cases are registered against the dera chief
 is maamle main court ne 7 sitambar ko sabhi pakshon ko court main talab kiya he jahaan par pariwaadee kamalesh kii bhi gavaahi honi he
 Kamlesh Rager, who lives in Manhorpur, Jagatpur, Jaipur, had planted a habeas corpus in the Rajasthan High Court that he had gone to the camp at Sirsa in Ram Rahim with his wife Guddi Devi of 26 years and their children
 23 se 25 march 2015 tak voram rahim ke ashramame the lekin vahaan ke incharge datta patni ko ram rahim se milwane le gaye tab se uski patni nahin mili or ab deraa vaale patni ke bare main poochne par ashram se bhaga de rahe hai
 After that, the court ordered the DGP of Rajasthan to produce Kamlesh's wife in the court
 magar police usko court main pesh karne main safal nahin ho pai to magistrate court ne ram rahim samet teen logon parmukademaadarj karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 As soon as Delhi's election results came, a pro-congress friend was feeding laddus to everyone
 mujhe bhi khilaayaa, poochne par usne bataaya ki bijepi se bas teen seat peeche rah gai he congress
 This is why he is very happy
 yahi haal zyaadaatar congressiyon kaa he jo is baat ko lekar zyada khush hai ki chunaav main bijepi haar gai
 He probably does not mind that his sweep has been cleared in the elections
 haalat yah he ki tivi se lekar akhbaar tak main isaki koi khaas charchaa nahin ho rahi he
 This is also probably the first time that Congress has contested all seats and lost all seats
 wo bhi tab jab ek saal pehle tak yahaan congress kaa raaj tha wo bhi lagaataar 15 saalon se
 The defeat is also not a minor one
 70 vidhansabha siton main 62 main congress kii jamaanat jabt ho gai
 Congress finished second in only four seats
 mukhyamantri pad ke liye congress ke ummidavaar ajay maakan ko sadar bazaar seat par mahaj 16,331 vot hi mili jabaki vijeta aap ke pratyaashee som dutt ko 67,507 vot mili
 BJP may have got just three seats this time, but it got 32 votes
 2 fisadi mili hai
 54 to the Aam Aadmi Party
 3 fisadi or congress ko 9
 Only 7 percent votes were received
 pichley baar hue vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ko 33
 3 per cent, 29 to you
 7 fisadi or congress ko 24
 7 percent votes were received
 in aankadon se ek cheez to bilkul jaahir he ki congress kaa ek bada vot bank puri tarah se aap ke paale main chalaa gaya he
 Not only Congress, but also BSP 1 this time in Delhi
 3 fisadi vot mili hai, vahiin pichley dfa ise 5
 35 percent votes were received
 congress kii haar main badi bhoomika chunavi survey ne bhi nibhaai
 In different surveys, the Congress was shown to get just one to three seats
 votaron ke bich aisa sandesh gaya ki bijepi ke khilaaf congress ko vot dena apane vot ko barabaad karnaa he
 Therefore, such voters took care of you
 saaf he ki khatre kii ye ghanti bijepi ke bajaay duusari partiyon ke liye kahin zyada he
 BJP leader Narendra Modi and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal both talk of Congress Mukt Bharat
 apane aapako secular hone ke naam par congress saare vipaksh ko ekajute karti rahi he
 If the same opposition now comes after Kejriwal, then where will the Congress go
 isliye sankat congress ke liye kahin zyada he
 It is still not late
 agar congress vaaki main marz kaa ilaaj karnaa chaahati he to maukon kii kami nahin he kyonki kendra me modi or dilli main ab kejariwal
 Therefore, he has a completely empty ground to play the role of a vigilant opposition
 to phir se jagah ban hi jaaegi
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is going to his former school 'the Doon School'
 skool main yojit vaad-vivaad pratiyogita main apni bahan priyanka gandhi ke saath vah apane purv ke schuli dinon ko yaad karenge
 His nephew and Priyanka Vadra's son are also studying in this school
 unke aane kii khabar kii pushti karte hue congress ke uttarakhand adhyaksh preetam singh ne kaha he kii vah or tamaam kangrasi netaa apane rashtriya netaa rahul gandhi kaa swaagat karne airport par jaaenge
 After which Rahul will reach the Doon School by road, after the completion of the school program, he will reach Jolly Grant Airport by road, from where he will fly directly to Delhi
 rahul ke aagaman se jahaan congress kheme main utsaah he, vahiin ek choti-si kami bhi mahasoos dikhaai de rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi will not meet the grassroots workers this time
 uttarakhand congress adhyaksh preetam singh ne rahul gandhi ke kaarykram ko sankshipt bataate hue kaha ki bhale is baar unka rashtriya netritv kii kaman ke sutaradhar ke paas samay kaa abhaav he, magar barsaat ke mausam ke khatm hone ke baad ham unase anurodh karenge kii wo ek baar phir se congressi kaaryakartaaon se milane devbhumi aaye or sabhi kaa utsahvardhan karen jisase aane vaale chunaav main congress puure damakham se chunaav main jeet hasil karen
 Significantly, the top leadership of the BJP has just started touring across the country, starting preparations for the 2019 elections and bjp's national president Amit Shah is on frequent tours where he is busy every day encouraging his grassroots workers
 
 vah apni ranneeti par lagaataar bina ruke kaam karte ja rahe hai, aise main uttarakhand main buree haar kaa saamana karne ke baad agar rahul gandhi bhi apane jamini kaaryakartaaon se milte to shaayad congress kheme kii gutbandi bhi khatm hoti or kaaryakartaaon main josh kaa bhi pravaah hota
 After the personal program, if the Congress National Vice President had given even half an hour to his workers, then he could have some degree of success in silencing the mutual faction
 is bure raajnneetik daur main congressi kheme ko isaki sakht jarurat bhi thi or yahpradesh congresske liye sanjivani kaa kaam bhi kar sakati thi
 Govt has given any such direction, neither it is reqd

 In response to this question, 47 percent of the people surveyed in January 2018 believed that visiting the temples of Tharahul Gandhi challenged bjp's monopoly of Hindutva
 vahiin 39 fisadi log aisa nahin maanate hai
 At the same time, 13 percent people do not have any opinion about this

 At the same time, 35 percent do not believe so
 vahiin 14 fisadi log is bare main koi raay nahin rakhte hai
 In this way, it is believed that half of the people of the country believe that the visit of Rahul Gandhi to the temples has challenged the bjp's monopoly of Hindutva
 vahiin, 35 fisadi log is baat se sahmati nahin rakhte hai
 Significantly, in the year 2018, there was a competition between BJP and Congress presidents to visit temples and monasteries

 An elderly woman from Mumbai, after 12 years of her husband's death, expressed such a thing on the Humans of Bombay Facebook page, that by reading, you will not only get to know the story of the love of both of them, but you will also want that age At the stage, when you start feeling weak and lonely will haunt you, then you should have the same partner
 apni post main 89 varsh kii is mahila ne apane jivan ke tamaam sukhad pahaluon ke bare main zyada kuch to nahin likhaa, lekin pati ke ritair hone ke baad samay saath-saath vyateet karne ke sambandh main kuch baaten kahi hai
 The elderly woman writes that after retirement, he never sat empty nor did I
 ham hameshaa kuch na kuch karte rahete
 The special thing was that whatever we do together, we will live together and love each other more fully
 ve likhti hai ki ham ghar ko sajaane ke liye paint karte, sajaavat kaa saamaan lagaate, shaam ko saath baithkar tivi dekhte, or yahaan tak ki khaanaa bhi saath pakaate
 She says that her husband loved something more then going to Evening Walk in the evening and he also used to go on long walks
 apane un dinon ko yaad karte hue post main vah bataati hai ki jab bhi ham saath hote vah meraa haath thamkar chalate the
 Especially, he always noticed that whenever we cross the road, he would definitely hold my hand and leave only when we crossed the road completely
 donon kaa yah pyaar bharaa saath tab tak chalaa jab tak unke pati kaa dehanth nahin ho gaya
 In her post, the woman has told that when her husband slept one night 12 years ago, he remained asleep
 apane man kii vyathaa ko bataate hue bujurg mahila ne likhaa ki vah unke saath or samay bitaana chaahati thim or ab bhi chaahati hai
 The most painful and heart touching thing this elderly lady wrote while writing that i still keep myself busy
 dopaher or raat kaa khaanaa khaane ke liye apni beti ke ghar jaati hum, or jab bhi mauka miltaa he kuch saarvajanik kaaryakramon main bhi hissaa leti hum, lekin ab sabakuch pehle jaisaa nahin he, mujhe aaj bahut dikkat hoti he
 After this, this woman said what she wanted to tell her husband, but could not say while they were alive
 aap yadi bhavuk insaan hai to shaayad aapaki ankhen bhi nam ho jaaen or galaa bhar aae
 She writes that now at the age of 89, i can say that i have lived a better life, and i have never been afraid of anything
 sirf ek baat ko chhodkar jo main kabhi apane pati se nahin kah pai ki mujhe sadak paar karne main dar lagata he
 i still need his help in crossing the road

 Posted by Humans of Bombay on monday, November 16, 2015 In her post, the 89-year-old woman did not write much about all the pleasant aspects of her life, but has said some things regarding the time spent together after her husband retires
 bujurg mahila likhti hai ki ritairement ke baad na vah kabhi khaali baithe or na main
 We are always doing something
 khaas baat yah thi ki ham jo bhi karte saath saath karte or ek duusare ke saath or pyaar ko puri tarah jite
 She writes that we would paint to decorate the house, put up decorations, sit in the evening watching TV, and even cook food together
 vah bataati hai ki unke pati ko sabase zyada kuch pasand tha to shaam ke samay evening walk par janaa or vah bhi lambii walk par jate the
 In the post, remembering her days, she says that whenever we were together, she used to hold my hand
 khaskar vah hameshaa is baat kaa dhyaan jab bhi ham sadak paar karen vah meraa haath jarur pakaden or tabhi chhodte the jab ham sadak puri tarah paar kar lete
 This love of both of them lasted till her husband died
 apni post main mahila ne bataaya he ki 12 saal pehle ek raat unke pati jab soye to vah soye hi rah gaye
 Describing the agony of her mind, the elderly woman wrote that she wanted to spend more time with them and still wants to
 sabase dardanaak or dil ko chune vaali baat is bujurg mahila ne likhte hue kaha ki main aaj bhi apane ko vyast rakhti hum
 i go to my daughter's house to have lunch and dinner, and whenever i get the chance, i attend some public events too, but now everything is not the same, i have a lot of trouble today
 iske baad is mahila ne vah baat kahi jise vah apane pati ko bataanaa to chaahati thi, lekin unke jinda rahete yah kah nahin pai
 If you are an emotional person, then maybe your eyes become moist and your throat gets filled
 vah likhti hai ki ab 89 saal kii umr main, main yah kah sakati hum ki maine ek behatar jindagi ji he, or mujhe kabhi kisi baat se dar nahin laga
 Except for one thing that i have never been able to say to my husband that i am afraid to cross the road
 mujhe aaj bhi sadak paar karne main unke madad kii darkaar he
 The comments dil tut sa jaataa he

 In Jharkhand, a plan was launched to save BPL families from below poverty line through Gau Mata
 lekin yojana kaa kuch hi maheene main dam nikalataa najar aa rahaa he
 The families who have got these cows are now worried about what to feed the cows and what to eat on their own
 unka kahana he ki in gaayon ko paalane main unki bachi-khuchi khetibari bhi bik jane kaa khatra he
 Sick cows were stopped, two cows were to be provided to every BPL household in Damrajya at an interval of 6-6 months at 90% subsidy in the state
 daawa kiya gaya tha ki ye gaay har din 10 se 15 litre doodh dengi jisase bipiel pariwaron ko aarthik sahaara milegaa
 But now many families allege that they were given Bima Gayathama
 ye gaay din main sirf 2 se 3 litre doodh hi de rahi hai
 In such a situation, these families are losing their strength in feeding the cows

 Officers and middlemen made crores of rupees! a provision of 12 billion rupees was made for this scheme by the government
 isamen har gaay ke liye 45 hajaar rupee or rahane ke shed ke liye 15 hajaar rupee tay kiye gaye
 The government's intention was to benefit 20,000 BPL families in the state through cows
 akele ranchi main hi dedh hajaar pariwaron ko ye gaay banti jaani thim
 So far, for 150 families who have got cows here, the place of scarcity has increased

 julri diziner farah khan ali (farah Khan Ali) ne piem narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Farah Khan has taunted PM Modi on the pretext of mangoes
 When the PM stops his obsession with the Gandhi family, maybe he will discuss country politics that revolve around “aam” Aadmi 
 Except the only "aam" he knows are Mangoes Farah Khan Ali on his Twitter account, while targeting PM Narendra Modi, wrote: 'when will PM Gandhi end his obsession with the family will do

 Several party leaders openly supported the parties on various issues
 Pilot said on Gehlot's decision regarding the civic elections
 The tie-up between senior Congress leaders in Hamalarajasthan has now come to the surface
 iske chalate desh kii sabase puraani party spasht taur par do dhadon main banty hui dikh rahi he
 Many party leaders have now started openly favoring some group on various issues
 iske chalate mukhyamantri ashok gahalot or upmukhyamantri sachin payalat ke kheme kii ladaai pehle kii tulana main or zyada spasht ho gai he
 What is the whole matter? Here, when Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot attacked Ashok Gehlot's decision regarding the elections, many party leaders took command on behalf of Gehlot or Pilot
 payalat kaa aarope he ki gahalot ne bina congress party ko vishwaas main liye niyam banaaya he ki parshad kaa chunaav nahin ladane vaala vyakti bhi meyar or sthaneey nikaay kaa pramukh ban saktaa he
 This open camp has exposed differences between the two leaders
 rajasthan sarkaar ke upmukhyamantri sachin payalat ne is mudde par kaha, 'yah gavarnence kaa masalaa he
 i am part of the government and i am also the president of the party
 yah kisi vyakti kaa nahin, balki siddhant kaa sawaal he
 The principle is that democracy needs to be transparent and the party stands with this principle
 isliye main nahin maanata ki yah 'k' banaam 'kha' kaa maamla he
 "he further said," This matter is of the faith which i believe to be true and it is necessary
 yahi rajya ke liye or hamaare logon ke liye sahi he, isliye maine apana mat prakat kiya he
 Actually, the case was never discussed
 jabase sarkaar bani he, pichley 10 maheene main hamane teen cabinet meeting kii hai, pichhali meeting main is apratyaksh charchaa hui thi, lekin yah faisla vibhaag ne cabinet kii jaankaree ke bina le liya
 'gehlot got support of close ministers Many ministers considered close to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot openly supported the decision that the way the body elections are being conducted is correct
 mukhyamantri gahalot ke kareebi mantri shanti dhariwal ko nagar nikaay chunaavon ke liye apratyaksh chunaav karaane kaa kaam saunpa gaya he
 Cabinet Minister Pratap Singh Khachariwas in the Rajasthan government also supported the government's decision
 cabinet mantri pratap singh khachariyavaas ne kaha, 'hamane pehle nikaay chunaavon main pratyaksh chunaav karaane kaa faisla kiya tha
 However, this decision was changed as there is a need to empower councilors in local body elections
 'upmukhyamantri sachin payalat ne khulkar is faisle se asahmati jataai to kai party netaa, yahaan tak ki mantriyon ne bhi unka samarthan kiya
 Minister Ramesh Meena and former Mayor of Jaipur Jyoti Khandelwal supported the pilot
 sachin payalat ne uthaae sawalsachin payalat se jab unke or rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ke bich kathith daraar ke bare main sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha ki unhone is mudde par ek virodhabhasi rukh apanaaya he kyonki yah vyaktiyon kaa nahin, balki siddhanton kaa maamla he
 Former Jaipur Mayor Jyoti Khandelwal said that it is better to conduct direct elections, because through direct elections, people are more accountable and they are more confident
 payalat bhale hi apane najariye ko siddhanton kaa maamla bataa rahe hon, lekin kai netaaon kaa maananaa he ki congress ke bheetar chal rahi is andruni kalah ne vipaksh ko sarkaar or congress kii chhavi par keechad oochhaalane kaa mauka de diya he
 Due to this infighting, the image of Rajasthan Congress is also getting tarnished
 rajasthan bijepi ke adhyaksh satish puniya ne is masale par kaha, 'congress ke bheetar chal rahi kalah se rajasthan ke logon kaa hit prabhavit ho rahaa he
 The Congress is withdrawing from its initial stance of holding direct elections for the post of Mayor in the bodies elections
 ' Former England batsman and captain Kevin Pietersen believes that England's batting is weak and the team will miss star all-rounder Ben Stokes in the high-profile Ashes series against Australia this year
 petersan ne kaha, 'main samajhataa hum ki jo root or elester cook ke bina ballebaaji kram bahut kamjor he
 The batsmen lack experience and if Stokes does not go with the team it will be even more lethal for England
 'ieenes ke mutabik petersan ne kaha, 'log kehete hai ki ek khilaadi se team nahin banati, lekin agar vah ek khilaadi 140 kimi prati ghante kii raftaar se gendbaaji karke wicket dilaae to vah mahatvapurn khilaadi he

 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan kii 48 main se 41 siton par dhamaakedaar jeet ke baad se congress or ensipi kii mushkilen bad gai hai
 Since Maharashtra elections are to be held at the end of the year
 aise main donon dalon kii ore se samay rahete gathbandhan ke deele pech kasne kii kavayad tej ho gai he
 But the matter is stuck with the seat sharing
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke nai dilli sthit awaas par beete 29 june ko maharashtra pradesh congress ke adhyaksh ashok chavaan pahunche the
 During this, he held talks with NCP in the assembly elections
 baad main ashok chavaan ne is baat kii pushti kii thi ki baithak main ensipi ke saath gathbandhan ko final karne par charchaa hui, magar yah bhi kaha ki abhi siton kaa bantwaaraa nahin hua he
 Chavan, the state president of the Congress, also spoke about the options for open alliances with the deprived Bahujan Aghadi party
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan kaa muqabla karne ke liye congress-ensipi sirf bahujan aghadi hi nahin balki raaj thakare kii manase ko bhi apane saath jodne kii taiyaari main hai
 The recent meetings of Raj Thackeray with NCP chief Sharad Pawar and former Maharashtra Congress president Manikrao Thackeray are being linked to the alliance
 kya fansaa he pech?sutara bataa rahe hai ki maharashtra main ensipi se ab tak gathbandhan kii surat main hameshaa congress zyada siton par ladi
 But the NCP performed better than the Congress in the recent Lok Sabha elections
 26 loksabhaa siton par ladakar bhi congress sirf 1 seat jeet saki, jabaki 22 siton par ladane vaali ensipi 4 siten jeetne main safal rahi
 One party got Owaisi's party and another went to the account of the Nirmal
 anya 41 siten bijepi-shivasena ne jeetin
 Sources say that the NCP, which won 4 seats in the Lok Sabha elections, compared to the Congress one, wants to come in a bigger position in the alliance
 ensipi kii ore se zyada siton kii maang ne congress ko asahaj kar diya he
 Therefore, after the Lok Sabha, even in the assembly elections, even after the alliance is almost final, so far the seat-sharing has not been done
 ab tak gathbandhan main congress hi bade bhai kii bhoomika main rahi he
 In the 2014 assembly elections, Congress won 42 seats and NCP won 41 seats
 sutron kii maane to ensipi kii daleel he ki maharashtra main congress kaa janaadhar lagaataar khisak rahaa he
 In such a situation, the NCP does not want to be 21 or 19 even better than the Congress
 rahul or supriya main kya banegi baat?samay ke saath congress or ensipi main yuva netritv kii bhoomikaayen majboot hui hai
 Earlier, talks between the two parties were between Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar
 ab gathbandhan ko aage badhaane kaa daaromadar congress main jahaan rahul gandhi ke kandhe par hai, vahiin ensipi main sharad pavaar kii beti supriya sule ne yah tosk apane haath main le liya he
 Sources reveal that there has been a discussion between NCP MP Supriya Sule and Congress President Rahul Gandhi regarding the alliance in Parliament House

 In Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, the conflict between Thakurs and Dalits seems to be taking serious form
 yahaan bhadki taaja hinsa main ab tak ek shaks kii maut ho gai, jabaki kareeb gambhir 10-12 ghayal hue hai
 The violence erupted in Shabbirpur village in the district just after the visit of BSP supremo Mayawati
 praapt jaankaree ke mutabik, mayawati kii raily se laut rahe logon par hamalaa hua, jiske baad ilaake main maheene bhar ke andar teesri baar hinsa bhadak uthi
 Amid the rampaging violence in Saharanpur, the Bhima Army and its chief Chandrashekhar Azad 'ravana' have emerged as the new voice of the Dalits
 pichley dinon dilli ke jantar mantar par virodh pradarshan ke dauraan chandrashekhar ko baari samarthan miltaa dikhaa
 Apart from Uttar Pradesh, a large number of Dalits came from states like Bihar, Haryana, Jharkhand and Punjab in this rally
 kuch anumaanon ke mutabik, is virodh pradarshan main kareeb 50,000 log shaamil hue the
 Such unity was observed after a long time under the leadership of Chandrashekhar, chief of Bhima Army and Gijnesh Mavani of Gujarat
 bhim army ke samarthan main jantar mantar par hua virodh pradarshan rajya or centre sarkaron ke prati daliton ke man main gusse kaa pratik to tha hi, saath hi isane bahujanon kii raajnneeti karne vaali basapa supremeo mayawati ko bhi sambhavat: chintit kar gaya
 According to experts, after seeing her land slipping among the Dalits, Mayawati decided to go to Saharanpur after about a month
 daliton ke bich mayawati kii lokapriyata main kaaphi giravat dikhi he or unka kor dalit votbank bhi chhitaka he
 While his party BSP could not get a single seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, his party had to be satisfied with only 19 seats out of 403 in the recent UP assembly elections
 jaankaron kii maane to yuva daliton ke ek bade tabake kamayawati se mohabhangahota dikhaa he
 The growing popularity of the Bhima Army among these youths has definitely brought a wrinkle on Mayawati's forehead

 On this, the police had made a case against Chandrashekhar for allegedly inciting violence

 He called for a statewide bandh on 3 January, which was an unprecedented success
 india today se senior sab editorsaroj kumaarane unase is masale par baatcheet kii
 Here are the key parts: Saswal: How do you see the attack on Dalits going to participate in Bhima Koregaon event? Prakash Ambedkar: This is an attack on Hindus not on Dalits but on Hindus
 ek hindu duusare hindu par hamalaa kar rahaa he
 Question: Whom do you blame for this? Prakash Ambedkar: i have already told that behind this is the hand of Manohar alias Sambhaji Bhide of Shiva establishment and Milind Ekbote of all Hindu Aghadis
 sawaalh to kya yah daliton par hamalaa nahin he?prakaash ambedkaraiyah cast aaidentity kaa sawaal nahin he balki dharmik aaidentity se hamalaa kar rahaa he
 There is no mention of cast angle in this
 sawaalh kuch log ise maratha banaam dalit bataa rahe hai?prakaash ambedkarsenhin aisi koi baat nahin he
 Those who want to divide communities, want to divide, they must be saying so
 isamen cast andal nahin dekha janaa chahie
 Question: Then what is it? Prakash Ambedkar: Many non-registered Hinduist antisocial organizations have sprung up that allegedly talk of Hindutva
 ye pehle musalamaanon ke khilaaf khud ko pesh kar rahe the
 Now when the Muslims have stopped reacting against them, they have started hunting down the weaker castes of Hindus
 thik vaise hi jaise sher jab aadamkhor ho jaataa he, to vah jo bhi saamne aae unka maance noch daalata he
 If they are not getting Muslims, then they have now targeted the dalit-obcs
 ye nae ‘hafid said’ hai
 Question: Why do such Hinduist organizations have problems with Dalits? Prakash Ambedkar: The talk of these organizations, which talk of the so-called Hindu interest, has been imprisoned for the first time
 pehle wo kehete the ki unka andolan yaa virodh musalamaanon ko lekar tha
 But that was not his whole motive
 unki asal manshaa is cond se pehali baar saamne aa gai he
 There are also many non-registered Hindu organizations which do not follow the legal system, government or parliament
 main inhen hindu aatankwaadi ke taur par unhen dekh rahe hai
 They intend to kill anyone
 vyaktigat taur par inke kartadhartaaon ko ‘hafiz said’ bananaa he
 Question: Some people are telling the hand of RSS and BJP behind it? Prakash Ambedkar: The talk of RSS is different and the talk of these organizations is different
 na to ye sanghathan aresas ko apana bataate hai or na aresas inako apana
 Now those who are such rowdy Hindutva organizations who allegedly talk about Hindus, now many Hindus have to think about whether to allow such people to be 'hafiz Saeed' or not
 sambhaji bhide ko pradhanmantri narendra modi apana guru maanate hai or pradhanmantri inke pair choote hai
 Now the BJP has to decide whether they want 'hafiz Saeed' or not
 agar ‘hafid said’ nahin chahie to sambhaji ko giraftaar karke adaalat main pesh karen
 Question: Are Dalits angry with the government? Prakash Ambedkar: This time many social people were allies in Bhima Koregaon for the first time
 ve apane purakhon kaa abhivadan karne aa rahe the
 Now all of them are asking whether they cannot even greet their forefathers? If the government is not doing anything for them now, then they are angry
 hamane to 3 janvari ko band ke baad unako abhi shant karvaa diya he lekin aag to jalati rahati he
 It is not known when it will erupt now, it depends on the government
 or haa, yah sirf daliton kaa aakrosh nahin he balki sabhi pichhadi jatiyon kaa aakrosh he
 Question: What do you want from the government? Prakash Ambedkar: Our first demand is to arrest them first
 system par jo haaavee hona chaah rahaa he, unka manobal tode sarkaar
 *** input- bhashaa He said that there is a fear of examination among students today
 vah pariksha ke naam se hi darane lage hai
 We have to eradicate the fear inside them
 hamen yah sochna hoga ki ham kis tarah se bacchon ke andar ke is dar ko khatm kar sakate hai
