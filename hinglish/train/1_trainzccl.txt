 Though the Modi government termed measures like demonetisation and GST to be a big step against corruption and black money, especially Vijay Mallya and the PNB scam, the government's strictness on financial irregularities raised questions

 jaise jasraj ke janmate hi pita pandit mothiram ne unhen shahad chataaya tha
 In their house it is called Chutti Pilana
 maa krishna bai kaa kahana tha ki sabhi bacchon main se mothiram ji ne keval jasraj ko hi shahad chataaya tha
 The children got a good opportunity to serve the mother, as she lived till 1957
 pita to apane gane ke silsile main aate-jate rahete the
 For the readers of Sahitya Aaj Tak, a part of the book 'rasraj- Pandit Jasraj': Village Pili Mandouri, where Jasraj was born is about 70 km from Hisar (haryana)
 us samay vah punjab main tha
 The station was about 12 kilometers from the village
 ek din pandit mothiram kahin se program karke gaanv laute
 Since the distance between the station and the village was too much, he came on a camel
 saafe-suthere safed kapade pahane hue the
 Many small children were playing in the field
 ek bachche kii taraf ishaara karke pandit mothiram ne kisi se poocha ki- bhaiya ye kiskaa baccha he? to unhen uttar mila ki ye aap hi kaa baccha he
 Immediately descended from the camel and lifted Jasraj into the dock, bathed in dust
 na apane safed kapadon kii parvaah kii or na hi do-dhai varsh ke jasraj kii dhul main sani poshaak kii ore dekha
 After picking them up in the dock, they came home on foot
 uske baad kya hua, isaki smriti kisi ko nahin he
 Nanhe was the full family of Jasraj
 dher saare bhai-bahin, bade bhai maniram, bahin padmabai (rattan mohan sharma kii maan), bhai pratap narayan, phir do bahinen jo nahin raheen, rajaraam (raja bhaiya), bahin puspa or jasraj
 There were many children, Jasraj had the ninth number
 inke baad ek bachche kaa janm or hua jiskaa dehant ho gaya
 Jasraj vaguely remembers the marriage of elder sister Rama
 puure parivaar main wo sabase sundar thim
 There is some remembrance of the marriage of elder brother Saheb Maniram ji
 baraat abohar gayi thi jisamen ye bhi gayi the
 Jasraj was born on 28 January 1930
 ko hua
 Father Pandit Motiram lived only occasionally in the village
 wardha ke shankarrav meghe ke saath unki ghanishtha mitrataa thi or wo apana adhik samay shankarrav meghe ke yahan wardha main hi vyateet karte the
 The Meghe family is associated with politics nowadays
 shankarrav meghe apane bhattije dada meghe ke yahan chale gayi to mothiram ne unke pita se kaha ki baba, main to hoon aapaki seva karne ke liye
 He then wrote a letter in his house
 parivaar kii sambhavtah bahut yaad aayi hogi
 It was written in the letter that if you want to see my mouth, then come away
 beti kii shaadi ke baad 10 din main hi vivaah-mandap or puraa kaam-kaaj samet kar vah gaanv se ravaanaa ho gayi the or kisi ke saath thik se baithne kaa avasar nahin mila tha
 So as soon as the letter was received, the wife i
e
 Maniram and Jasraj's mother tied all the household items, jewel, money whatever was in the bundle and kept it near the Chaudhary of Mataji Mrs
 Krishna Bai village
 maniram pita ke saath hi rahete the or parivaar ko livane aaye the
 So Ma, Maniram and Jasraj, all three came out of the village

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) October 5, 2016 yun to dopaher ke samay main sone kii aadat ko sehat ke liye galat samajha jaataa he
 But few people know that there are some benefits of taking a nap in the afternoon
 kai study main is baat kii pushti ho chuki he
 An assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania described a sleepy nap in the afternoon as beneficial for health
 unhone kaha, 'dopaher main sone se kaam main zyada man lagata he
 The mood remains fresh
 shodhakartaaon kaa manana he ki isse immunity bhi majboot hoti he
 Apart from this, the risk of heart disease is also reduced
 'study: public transport main asurakshit mahasoos karti hai bharat kii ladkiyanhaalanki, dopaher ke samay main neend lene se aapako raat main sone main dikkat ho sakati he
 So it is important for you to know how much time you should sleep during the day
 - kitne samay ke liye soendin ke samay main 15 se 30 minute kii jhapai le sakate hai
 If you still feel sleepy then it is better to have a full 90 minutes of sleep
 kyonki neend puri na hone se aap pehle se zyada thakaan or sir dard mahasoos kar sakate hai
 But taking 90 minutes of sleep will not make you feel tired and you will be able to do your work better
 - workout or neendshodhakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki workout karne ke fouran baad sone se bachein
 Sleep at least 2 hours after exercising
 din main agar sone kii aadat he to sone kaa ek samay tay kar len
 Be careful, you can give a hobby of selfie to knock many diseases - it is not necessary for everyone to take a sleep nap during the day, if you do not sleep during the day then avoid sleeping during the day
 ek study ki report main is baat kii pushti ho chuki he ki lagbhag 50 fisadi logon ko dopaher main sone se zyada phayda nahin hota he
 These people have a circadian rhythm
 sarkadian ridam sharir ko bataati he kab sona he, kab uthanaa he
 If you do not feel sleepy during the day, then it shows that your body does not need rest

 haryana se lekar dilli ke ames main kai ghotaalon kaa khulaasa kar siyaasi or prashasnic galiyare ko hilaa dene vaale visil blower afasar sanjeev chaturvedi ke cese kii sunwaayee se ab tak kai jaj alag ho chuke hai
 The latest case is that of CAT chairman Justice L
 Narasimhan Reddy
 haalanki justise reddy ne cese se alag hone ke peeche ke kaarnon kaa khulaasa kiya he, anya jajon ke aadesh main is baat kaa spasht zikr nahin he ki unhone kin kaarnon se cese kii sunwaayee se khud ko dur kiya
 In different cases related to Sanjeev Chaturvedi, till now judges of Supreme Court, High Court to CJM level have separated themselves
 kendriya prashasnic nyaayaadhikaran(cat) ke chairman justise el narsimhan reddy ne 29 march ko jari apane aadesh main kaha he ki vah chaturvedi ke lambit chaar prakarnon kii sunwaayee se khud ko alag karte hai
 In the order, he has said that this is a very rare episode, in which very unfortunate incidents were happening
 jiske kaaran chairman ke pad kii pratishtha hi daanv par lag gai thi
 Due to these circumstances, it was necessary that the plaintiff file a case for hearing his case in another court in place of this court
 isi ke saath justise reddy ne register ke jariye yah aadesh bhi diya ki vaadi ko uski yachikaaon se sambandhit file waapas kar di jaae, taaki vah kanoon ke anusaar kisi anya sakasham nyaayalay main vaad daayar kar sake
 It is said that such an order may have been given for the first time, when the judge has issued orders to return the plaintiff till the file of the case
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is prakaran kii shuruyaat july 2018 main die gaye justise reddy ke us aadesh se hui, jisamen unhone sanjeev chaturvedi kii asiaar ke maamle main nainital cat main chal rahi sunwaayee ko chah saptaah ke liye sthagit kar diya tha
 At that time, Chaturvedi was sent to Finland for training by the central government
 is aadesh ko chaturvedi ne uttarakhand ucch nyaayalay main chunauti di thi, jis par hai court ne centre va ames ke ravaiye ko pratham drushtya badla lene vaala bataate hue 25 hajaar kaa jurmaana bhi lagaaya
 The High Court also gave a clear order that the hearing of Sanjeev Chaturvedi's ACR case be held in the Nainital CAT itself
 is nirnay ko ames ne chunauti main chunauti di gai, jisane ucch nyaayalay ke nirnay ko barkaraar rakhte hue 25 hajaar kaa or jurmaana lagaaya
 Meanwhile, Justice Reddy decided to separate himself from the case on 29 March
 sutara bataate hai ki yah pehla maamla nahin he, jab congress or bijepi donon sarkaron main bhrashtachar ke maamalon kaa khulaasa karne ke kaaran sarkaron kii aankh kii kirakiri bane sanjeev chaturvedi ke samvedansheel cese kii sunwaayee se kisi jaj ne khud ko alag kiya ho
 The Ajmer Municipal Corporation has left the BJP in the civic elections in Rajasthan
 bijepi yahaan ke 60 nigam siton main se 31 par jeet darj kar aage thi
 At the same time, Congress got 22 seats and seven seats went to independents
 in nateezon se is pratishthit nigam main bijepi kaa board bananaa tay tha, lekin phir ek nayaa drama dekhne ko mila
 Surendra Singh alias Lala Bana, a BJP councilor, filed his nomination for mayor in front of the party candidate
 bijepi ne sabhi parshadon ko ek din pehle pushkar ke ek hotel main band karke rakhaa tha, lekin jaise hi parshad apana meyar chunane nikle, to lala bana sabko chakma dekar duusari gaadi main baith vahaan se nikal gaye
 It is evident that BJP leaders were stunned by this
 ajmer nagar nigam chunaav ke prabharee viraam singh ravat bole ki surendra singh ji achaanak gaayab ho gaye, unhone congress ke saath milke parchaa bharaa, party unhen kabhi maaf nahin karegi
 Comments isi afra-tafari ke bich bijepi ke log bhi nagar nigam main bhaagate hue pahunche
 His candidate Dharmendra Gehlot got some activists and got him nominated
 shaayad unhen andeshaa tha ki kahin vah bhi bhaag naa jaae
 The party showed the way out to Surendra Singh, but still could not stop cross voting
 nateeja ye hua kii bijepi ke bahumat main rahane ke baavjood, bijepi or congress donon partiyon ko 30-30 vot mili
 In such a situation a lottery was taken out, in which first the rebel Surendra Singh was declared the mayor
 lekin phir ek vot ko nirast karke dubaara voton ke ginati hui or bijepi ke ummidavaar ko aakhirkaar meyar ghoshit kar diya gaya
 With these results, the BJP board was set to be formed in this prestigious corporation, but then a new drama was seen
 bijepi ke ek parshad surendra singh urf lala bana ne party ummedwaar ke saamne meyar ke liye namakan bhar diya
 The BJP had locked all the councilors in a hotel in Pushkar a day earlier, but as soon as the councilors came out to elect their mayor, Lala became a dodge and got out of the other car
 zaahir he ise dekh bijepi netaaon main hadakamp much gaya
 In-charge of Ajmer Municipal Corporation Elections Viram Singh Rawat said that Surendra Singh ji suddenly disappeared, he colluded with Congress, the party would never forgive him
 ' tippaniyan Amidst this chaos, the BJP people also rushed to the municipal corporation
 unke ummidavaar dharmendra gehalot ko kuch kaaryakarta pakad ke laae or unase namakan bharvaya
 Perhaps he was afraid that he too might run away
 party ne surendra singh ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya, lekin phir bhi cross voting ko nahin roak pai
 The result was that despite BJP being in majority, both BJP and Congress parties got 30‚Äì30 votes
 aise halaat main lottery nikaali gai, jisamen pehle to baagi surendra singh ko meyar ghoshit kar diya
 But then one vote was repealed and the votes were counted again and the BJP candidate was finally declared the mayor

 Dangerous dengue mosquito bothers people all over the world
 har koi dengue ke machhar se nipatane ke liye alag-alag tareeke apanaate hai
 Someone burns incense sticks that kill and repel mosquitoes, then someone tries to deal with mosquitoes through liquid
 machharadaani or moscuto rapelent bhi aamtaur par istemaal hote hai, lekin iske baavjood dengue har saal mahamari kii tarah failata he
 Now in China, another way of fighting it has been devised

 The factory will release 10 lakh sterilized mosquitoes every week, thereby reducing the number of mosquitoes that spread dengue

 The release of sterilized mosquitoes into the forest is one of the many unique efforts made to combat dengue fever
 pichley saal china main dengue se 47,000 se zyada log prabhavit hue hai
 Most of these cases were in Guangdong province
 dengue kaa koi tikaa or sateek upachaar uplabdh nahin he or duniyabar main isse ek saal main kareeb 22,000 logon kii maut hui he
 China has set up the world's largest mosquito factory in Guangzhou province to combat dengue fever

 There is no barricade left
 sansad main 17 agast ko pesh kii gai niyantrak or mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) kii report ne bhanda phod diya he ki 57 koyala khadaanen nijee companiyon ko manamaane or gaiyr-paardarshee dhang se banti gai thim
 It ignored the advice of the Ministry of Coal to follow the bidding process in a transparent manner like in the auction and most of the time the Ministry of Coal was with Manmohan Singh himself when the allocations were made
 baat sirf itani nahin he
 The Prime Minister's office, led by him, consistently thwarted every attempt to launch a competitive bid in allocation of coal blocks for captive mining
 sieji kaa kahana he ki nilaamee kaa tarika apnaane se koyala mantralay ke inkaar ke kaaran sarkari khajaane ko 1
 86 lakh crore Rs
 kaa nuksaan hua he
 The beneficiaries of this include JSPL, Tata Steel, Tata Power, Tata Sponge, JSW Steel Limited, Essar Power Generation, Adani Power and Jindal Steel & Power Limited
 report kahati he ki vidambnaa yah he ki inamen se keval ek block- jharkhand kaa electrosteel castings limited- ab tak shuru ho sakaa he
 The Chief Vigilance Commissioner directed the CBI to investigate the irregularities in the allocation of mines and submit the report by 1 September
 sambhaavna he ki sibiai kuch or samay dene kii maang karegi
 This report has brought most opposition parties together
 vampanthi, biju janata dal or anna dramuk jaisi gaiyr-endie partiyon ne bhi bijepi or uske sahyogi dalon ke saath sur mila liya he
 The opposition has demanded the Prime Minister's resignation
 sarkaar ne maang maanane se inkaar kar diya he or kul milakar sieji report ne sansad ke kaamkaaj par grahan laga diya he
 However, there is hope that a solution will be found later in the day
 purv kendriya mantri yashavanth sinha kehete hai, ''ham manmohan singh ke istifv kii maang isliye nahin kar rahe hai ki ve pradhanmantri the, balki jis avadhi main kol block aavantit kiye gaye the, us puri avadhi main koyale ke prabharee mantri vahi rahe hai
 According to the rules of procedure, each allocation would be signed as the minister in charge
 lihaaja agar koi jimmedaar he to ve khud pradhanmantri hi hai
 In May 2004, Manmohan Singh was sworn in as Prime Minister
 sieji ne apni report main darj kiya he ki 2003-04 ke baad se 192 koyala khadaanen aavantit kii gai thim
 During Manmohan's tenure as Prime Minister, 142 coal mines were allocated to various government and private companies
 sieji ne sarkari fermon ko lekha pariksha ke daayre se baahar rakhte hue un blokon par dhyaan kendrit kiya, jinhen privet companiyon ko saunpa gaya tha
 The auditor also excluded underground mines from scrutiny
 antat usne apni nigahen maatr 57 (open cast or mili-jule) blokon par kendrit kin
 These were entrusted to private companies for captive mining through a process that lacked 'transparency and fairness'
 dilachasp baat yah he ki report main kisi bhi bindu par pradhanmantri kaa naam nahin liya gaya he
 But between November 2006 and May 2009, the Ministry of Coal was handling Manmohan Singh himself
 manmohan singh ke netritv vaale piemo par yah bhi aarope he ki koyala mantralay ne koshish kii thi ki ek sapaat-sa prashasnic aadesh jari kar paardarshee boli apana lee jaae, jisase koyala khadaanon ke aavanton main manamaani kii ashanka khatm ho jaae, lekin piemo ne in prayaason main adangha lagaaya
 The PMO directed the Ministry of Mines to amend the Mines and Minerals (development and Regulation) Act, 1957, which proved to be an over-long process
 mmdiar (sanshodhan) vidheyak sansad main 17 aktubar, 2008 ko pesh kiya gaya
 Parliament passed it in August 2010, but the government issued a notification for changes in the allocation policy on 2 February this year
 isi bich koyala blokon kaa aavanton pehle screening cameti kii siforeeshon par or baad main koyale par visheshgyon kii cameti (isisi) kii siforeeshon par kiya jaataa rahaa
 The CAG report says, "there was nothing in the minutes or other documents of the negotiating records indicating that applicants had been comparatively evaluated for allocation of mines, which had been approved by the screening committee
" ''kol blokon kaa aavanton kis aadhaar par ho? iske liye compatitive boli kaa vichaar sabase pehle 28 june, 2004 ko koyala sachiv kii adhyakshata main hui is maamle se jude tamaam pakshon kii ek baithak main rakhaa gaya tha
 The then coal secretary P
 si
 Parikh presented a detailed note to the Minister of State for Coal and Mines Dasari Narayan Rao on 16 July 2004, arguing that "
" 
 
 chunki kol india limited dwaara aapurti kiye jane vaale koyale va pratispardhi khanan dwaara utpaadit koyale kii keemat main baari antar he, isliye use apratyaashit laabh miltaa he, jise captive block aavantit kiya gaya hota he
 
 
 
 ''aisi paristhitiyon main koyala mantralay ne kol blokon kii nilaamee ko sabase acha tarika mana, kyonki yah 'paardarshee or uddeshypurna' thi
 Manmohan Singh continued to obstruct the coal ministry's efforts for competitive bidding
 ise kaise anjaam diya gaya? dekhieh11 sitambar, 2004 piemo ne ek note kaa masauda taiyaar kiya, jisamen nilaamee ke tareeke kii kamiyaan ginai gai thim
 Minister of State Dasari Narayan Rao specifically recorded that the competitive bid proposal cannot be moved forward, "as this would further delay the allocation of coal mines, as competitive bidding for allocation of coal blocks for commercial purposes" The Coal Mines (nationalization) Amendment Bill, 2000, adopting the selection process of the Lok Sabha, is pending in Rajya Sabha
 ''aktubar, 2004 piemo ne koyala blokon kaa aavanton pratispardhi boli ke madhyam se karne kii niti ke prati apana virodh doharaaya
 This is clear from the note of the Secretary of Coal, which states, ''
 
 
 niti par pradhanmantri karyaalay main charchaa kii gai or yah mahasoos kiya gaya ki chunki badi sankhya main aavedakon ne maujuuda niti ke aadhaar par kol blokon ke aavanton ke liye anurodh kiya (hua) he, isliye maujuuda niti ko badalakar pratispardhi boli par aadhaarit bananaa uchit nahin hoga
 "on 7 April 2006, after a meeting with representatives of various partner ministries, the PMO directed the Ministry of Mining to amend the MMDR Act, 1957 so that competitive bidding could be extended in the context of all minerals
 pratispardhi boli lagu karne vaala prashasnic aadesh is prakriya ko tej kar saktaa tha par manmohan ke piemo kaa iraadaa kuch or tha
 On 28 July 2006, the Law Department, in its opinion sent to the Ministry of Coal, left the decision to the government to adopt an easy and fast way of issuing an administrative order or to adopt a statutory route to adopt competitive bidding
 ab pataa chalata he ki piemo ne mmdiar adhinium main sanshodhan karwaane kaa tarika apanaaya
 July, 2006 Competitive bidding could be initiated as per the advice of the Law Department
 lekin piemo ke nirdesh ke tahat koyala mantralay ne yah salaah darkinar kar di or manamaane tareeke se aavanton jari rakhaa
 On October 17, 2008, the bill for change in law was introduced in Parliament and passed by Parliament in August 2010 after going through a long and complicated path
 lekin is sanshodhan ko do saal baad jaakar notiphoi kiya gaya, jisaki vajah samaj se pare he
 The Opposition has rejected the government's offer to discuss the CAG report in both houses of Parliament and also send it to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) for review
 congress pravaktaa manish tiwari tark dete hai, ''vipaksh sansad main bahes se kyon bhaag rahaa he? aap bahes karenge to tathy baahar aa jaaenge
 The report should be investigated by the PAC
 '' sansadeey maamalon ke rajyamantri rajeev shukla kehete hai, ''vipaksh pehle din se pradhanmantri kaa istipha maang rahaa he
 It cannot run
 '' sinha jawaab dete hai, ''hamen pataa he ki sieji kii report pehle sansad main or phir piesi main pesh kii jaati he
 Surely you will also get an idea of the fate of the CAG report on the 2G scam? The PAC has spent a year studying the CAG report and gathering evidence, and was disbanded by members of Congress when the report was ready to be accepted
 ise sansad main pesh karne kii bhi gunjaaish nahin rah gai
 "the road to darkness" is how the Prime Minister's Office of Manmohan Singh put constraints on competitive bidding for coal mines

 As such, people believe that the beginning of playing colors on Holi started in Erich of Jhansi, but the strange thing is that the people here do not consider this festival to be auspicious
 kehete hai ki holi ke din hi jhaansi main angrejon kaa farmaan pahunchaa tha ki ve lakshmibai ke bete damodar raav ko unka uttaradhikari nahin maanate
 Angered by this decree, Rani of Jhansi and the people there did not celebrate Holi
 aaj bhi jhaansi main aise log rahete hai, jo holi vaale din nahin, balki iske agle din is parv ko manaate hai
 The British had sent a decree
 
 
 gyaat ho ki 21 november, 1853 ko jhaansi ke raja gangadhar raav kii mrityu ke baad vahaan ke raaj kii kaman rani lakshmibai ke haathon main aa gai thi
 Before his death, Gangadhar Rao adopted a child (damodar Rao) and declared him his heir
 angrejon ne is satta ke hastantaran ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 The day this decree was issued in Jhansi, it was the same day
 om shankar 'asar' kii kitaab main he zikr
 
 
 a writer named Om Shankar 'asar' wrote a book in those days
 is kitaab kaa naam 'maharani lakshmibai or unki jhaansi' he
 Under this decree, Dalhousie wrote the letter - Jhansi kingdom is merged in British territory as per the orders of the Government of India on 7 March 1854
 is ishtahaar ke jariye sab logon ko soochna di jaati he ki jhaansi pradesh kaa shashan major elice ke adheen kiya jaataa he pradesh kii praja apane ko british sarkaar ke adheen samajhe or major elice ko 'kar' diya kare sukh, shanti or santosh ke saath jivan nirvaah kare
 Happiness turned into sorrow
 
 
 jhaansi gajetir main darj itihaas ke mutabik yah durbhagyapurna ghatana thik holi ke din ghati thi
 Preparations were on for the celebration of Holi
 isi bich angrejon kaa tughluqi farmaan sunaaya gaya
 People drowned in mourning and Holi was not celebrated
 rani ne kila choda or duusare mahal main chali gayi
 In this sorrow, even today many people of Jhansi do not celebrate Holi on Holi
 iske bajaay ve agle din rang khelte hai

 Cricketer' Michael Hussey enjoys batting with his IPL team Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and middle-order batsman Suresh Raina, as both of them have the ability to score fast runs to take pressure off them
 is
 hasi ne chennai kii kal raat yahaan dilli dairedevills par 86 ran kii jeet ke dauraan raina ke saath duusare wicket ke liye 60 or dhoni ke saath tisare wicket ke liye 74 ran kii saajhedaari kii thi
 The Australian batsman told reporters after the match, "it is good to bat with a player like Dhoni, who runs fast by batting in a careless manner
" unhone kaha, suresh raina doosraa khilaadi he, jo aisa karata he
 These batsmen remove pressure from you
 isse aap duusare chor se keval khaali jagahon par gend markar ran bator sakate ho
 Partnering with these two definitely helps
 tippaniyan Hussey scored an unbeaten 65 runs
 jab unase poocha gaya ki unki ranon kii bhukh ko dekhte hue kya vah antarrashtriya cricket main vaapasi par vichaar kar sakate hai, unhone muskaraate hue kaha, nahin main nischitator par apane faisle se khush hum
 The life of international cricket is very difficult
 aap saal main 10-11 maheene tak baahar rahete ho
 So my decision was not only related to cricket
 mere chote bachche hai or mere sanyas lene kii mukhya vajah yahi thi
 Hussey said about the match that the score of 150 here would have been good, because it was not easy to bat on the pitch of Ferozeshah Kotla
 chennai ne aakhri das overon main 109 ran jodakar chaar wicket par 169 ran banaae the
 He said, the new ball was staying slightly down
 sthiti kaa sahi akalan karnaa meri or murali vijay kii jimmedaari thi
 After that we could say what would be a good score and i think 150 would have been a good score
 bich main time out ke dauraan maine (coach) stephen fleming se yah baat kahi thi
 We were able to score 20 runs more because of Dhoni's ability to play big shots
 hasi ne haalanki kaha ki unki team ko lagaataar acha pradarshan karne kii jarurat he
 He said, we did very well
 kings ilevan (punjab) ke khilaaf jeet bhi kaaphi acchhee thi, lekin hamaare liye nirantarata banaae rakhana jaruri he
 We will have to work even harder

 hasi ne naabad 65 ran kii pari kheli
 When asked if he could consider a return to international cricket, given his hunger for runs, he smiled and said, "no, i am definitely happy with my decision
" antarrashtriya cricket kii jindagi kaaphi kathin hoti he
 You stay out for 10‚Äì11 months in a year
 isliye meraa faisla keval cricket se sambadhit nahin tha
 i have young children and this was the main reason for my retirement
 hasi ne match ke bare main kaha ki yahaan 150 ran kaa score acha hota, kyonki firozshah kotla kii pich par ballebaaji karnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Chennai had added 109 runs in the last ten overs to score 169 for four wickets
 unhone kaha, nai gend thodaa neeche rah rahi thi
 It was my and Murali Vijay's responsibility to assess the situation correctly
 iske baad ham kah sakate the ki acha score kya hoga or mere hisaab se 150 ran acha score hota
 i told this to (coach) Stephen Fleming during a timeout in between
 dhoni kii bade shot khilne kii kshamta ke kaaran ham 20 ran adhik banane main safal rahe
 Hussey, however, said that his team needs to perform consistently well
 unhone kaha, hamane bahut acha pradarshan kiya
 The win against Kings XI (punjab) was also good, but it is important for us to maintain consistency
 hamen aage bhi kadi mehnat kerani hogi
 We were able to score 20 runs more because of Dhoni's ability to play big shots
 hasi ne haalanki kaha ki unki team ko lagaataar acha pradarshan karne kii jarurat he

 team india ke purv salaami ballebaaj shiv sundar das kaa aaj janmdin he
 Born in Odisha's capital Bhubaneswar, Das is now a coach from the eastern region
 antarrashtriya kariyar main shiv sundar das kaa yogadan bataur test player hi rahaa
 He could not do anything special in odis
 haalanki unhen keval chaar vanade main hi khilne kaa mauka mila or isamen unhone kul milakar 13 kii ausat se 39 ran banaae
 Das emerged as a good Test opener
 daahine haath ke ballebaaj shiv sundar das ne 10 november 2010 ko test cricket main apni pehali pari khilne ke thik ek saal, ek maheene baad hi 15 disambar 2001 ko 1000 ran kaa aankada chhu liya tha
 For this, he played 28 innings of 15 Tests
 ek saal tak lagaataar achche pradarshan ke baavjood jab wo westeindies daure par naakaam rahe or paanch test kii aath pariyon main 15
 If he could score only 124 runs at an average of 5, he was not selected again in the team
 shiv sundar das ne bharat ke liye kul 23 test match khele
 During this, he 34
 89 kii ausat se do shatak or 9 ardhashatak samet 1326 ran banaae
 The best player in the presence of big players is the 2000‚Äì2001 tour of Zimbabwe
 tab team main sachin, ganguli, dravid or lakshmana jaise ballebaajon maujuud the
 In the Bulawayo Test, Zimbabwe scored 173 runs in the first innings, in response, the Indian team scored 318 runs
 lekin jab zimbabwe teesri pari khilne utari to usne 328 ran bana daale
 India needed 184 runs to win
 aise main jarurat thi salaami ballebaajon ke wicket par tik kar khilne kii
 Shiv Sundar Das, who scored 30 runs in the first innings, took it and scored 82 runs without being dismissed
 unke is pradarshan ke liye unhen main of da match chunaa gaya
 Shiv Sundar Das played his two century innings against Zimbabwe in Tests
 2001 main zimbabwe daure par bharat ne do test khele
 In his four innings, Das scored 30, 82 (not out), 57 and 70 and he was adjudged 'man of the Series' after 'man of the Match' in the first match
 das hajaari club main namwaise to das kaa antarrashtriya kariyar 2002 main hi khatm ho gaya lekin wo gharelu cricket lagaataar khelte rahe
 Das played in the Ranji Trophy matches for Odisha until 2010 and then Vidarbha till 2012 before retiring from cricket
 is dauraan unhone 10908 ran banaae or gharelu cricket ke das hajaari club main shaamil hue
 His best innings here was 300 not out with 24 centuries
 kai saalon tak wo logon ke sir katata rahaa
 And then the corpse was taken straight away and thrown outside Tihar Jail
 is chunauti ke saath ki pakad sako to pakad lo
 Then one day he was caught
 lekin hanrazanges taur par chhot bhi gaya
 As soon as he was released, the process of finding a corpse outside the Tihar jail had started once again
 1998 main mili thi pehali laashbaat 1998 kii he jab pehali baar tihaad jail ke paas ek laash mili thi
 After that, the process of suddenly finding dead corpses around the jail started
 police bhi is baat se pareshaan thi
 There was someone who used to go to Tihar Jail after every murder without going to the dead body
 maamla katl kaa tha to police chaukanna ho gai thi
 The Delhi Police had now started searching for the killer
 is tarah mili thi laashenkhun se sani katl kii yah silsilewar daastaan dilli ke adarsh nagar ilaake se shuru hui thi
 Where in 1998 the first beheaded corpse was found
 duusari sir kati laash 27 june 2003 ko alipur main, teesri sir kati laash 20 november 2003 ko tihaad jail ke get number 1 ke saamne, chauthi sir kati laash 2 november 2005 ko mongolpuri main, paanchavin sirkati laash 20 oktober 2006 ko tihaad jail ke get number-3 ke saamne, chhathi sirkati laash 25 april 2007 ko tihaad jail ke get number-3 ke saamne or saatvin sirkati laash 18 may 2007 ko phir se tihaad ke get number-3 ke saamne baraamad hui thi
 This was a big challenge for the police
 kaatil saamne tha, magar saboot nahipulice ke saamne ek ke baad ek chunauti rakhane vaale shaatir khooni kaa naam tha chandrakant jha
 The amazing thing was that after the first murder, the police also arrested Chandrakant Jha
 lekin sabooton ke abhaav main wo bari ho gaya
 And after that the process of murder was started again
 tihaad jail ke baahar laashon ke milane kaa silsilaa tham nahin rahaa tha
 The killer had a face in front of Delhi Police but he did not have evidence which could prove that Chandrakant is the culprit of these heady corpses
 zarur padhenmost wonted aatanki moulana masood ajahar kii khooni daastankatil kii pehali galatikhun karne ke baad kaatil ne paanchavin sirkati laash 20 oktober 2006 ko tihaad jail ke get number 3 ke saamne phenki thi
 On this day, the murderer made the first mistake
 darasal is laash ke saath usne pehali baar ek chitthee bhi chodi thi
 In which the police was directly challenged that if you can catch, then show it by catching
 chitthee main yun diya tha chalange''mere priyajanon dilli police ke jaanbaaj diechaji yani dilli homeguard se ipies adhikari tak tum sabhi ko tumhaare damaad kii taraf se khullam-khulla chalange he ki agar vaaki tum logon ne maa kaa doodh piya he to mujhe pakadakar dikhaao varanaa tum saare upare se lekar neeche tak ke dilli police staff ke log najayas aulaaden kahalaaoge
 "the mood of the letter was such that this letter from the serial killer stirred the entire department
" aakhirkaar police ne apane tamaam ghode daudaaye auki phir chandrakant jha ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 But soon Chandrakant Jha was once again released on bail due to lack of evidence
 sabooton ke abhaav main bari hota rahaa katilapulice ne pehle katl ke baad hi chandrakant ko giraftaar liya thi
 The police was also convinced that this is the killer
 is yakeen ko saboot kaa jama pehanaanaa baaki tha
 So the police started collecting evidence against Chandrakant to prove him guilty
 shekhar murder cese main police ne court main chandrakant ko kaatil tehraane ke liye kai subut or gavaah pesh kiye
 But all his arguments failed
 court ne subooton ke abhaav main jha ko bari kar diya
 The police did not have any evidence against Chandrakant even in the Umesh murder case
 lihaaza is maamle main bhi chandrakant ko court ne bari kar diya tha
 In the same Mongolpur murder case, Chandrakant was acquitted by the court for want of evidence
 kaatil ke khilaaf pehla sabutatihaad ke get number 3 ke paas mili saatvin or aakhri laash kii pahchaan dilip mandal ke rup main hui
 After the arrest of Chandrakant in this case, the head of the corpse was also recovered from the banks of the Yamuna on his spot
 yani saat main se teen katl main bari hone ke baad ab pehali baar koi pukhta saboot chandrakant ke khilaaf police ke haath laga tha
 But the investigation and evidence were still incomplete
 yahaan padhembivi or maa-baap ke katl kii ek khaufnak daastanpulice ne barti thi laaparvaaheena koi gavaah
 No strong evidence
 or naa hi koi chashmadid
 In such a situation, the question was whether Delhi Police would prove Chandrakant Jha as the serial killer of Delhi
 aisa nahin tha ki police ko chandrakant ko gherne ke maukey yaa saboot nahin mili
 But in time, the police could not use them properly
 masalan chandrakant jha ko giraftaar karne ke baad police ne uskaa ikbaalia bayaan to liya lekin magistrate ke saamne uskaa bayaan nahin karaayaa
 Whereas, a confession in the court is of no importance
 magistrate ke saamne die gaye 164 ke bayaan ko hi adaalat kanoonee manyata detii he
 The letter found with a caged corpse was sent to the lab for matching with Chandrakant's handwriting without being sealed
 yah police kii sabase badi laaparvaahee thi
 Because this letter would probably prove to be the most important evidence in this case
 or aage chal kar hua bhi
 It was proved that such a crime, yes, the biggest evidence against Chandrakant finally became the letter which he wrote to the Delhi Police
 khat kii likhaawat or chandrakant kii likhaawat ek thi
 The forensic report also confirmed this
 isi likhaawat ke aadhaar par aakhirkaar adaalat ne chandrakant ko doshi mana
 Apart from handwriting, the police also got the second most important clue from this letter
 darasal khat main chandrakant ne ye bhi likhaa tha ki wo 2003 main jail se nikal chukaa he
 Records showed that he was actually released on bail in 2003 from Tihar
 tihaad ke saamne amit naamak yuvak kii laash phenkane ke baad khud chandrakant ne harinagar thane main police ko phone kiya tha
 And was challenged to catch him if he could
 jis pisio se chandrakant ne police ko phone kiya tha, us pisio ke maalik ne adaalat main chandrakant ko pahchaan liya tha
 Apart from this, the police also found a blood stained knife in Chandrakant's house number 229 in Hyderpur
 khun kaa milan uske haathon maare gaye dilip naamak ek vyakti kii laash se hua tha
 That is why Chandrakant did the slaughter, when Chandrakant Jha was arrested
 poochtacha ke dauraan jab katl karne kii hakeekat police ke saamne ai to police vaale bhi hairaan rah gaye
 The murderer told the police that he had got the punishment for his actions, stating that he was killing the police
 ' police ne apni chargeshit main is khaufnak serial kiling kii jo vajah bataai vah vaaki main chaunkaane vaali he
 The reason was that Chandrakant Jha was a very angry person
 use achaanak kisi dost yaa saathi kii jaraa si baat bhi nagavar guzarati to wo uskaa katl kar baithta tha or laash kii shinaakht ko mitaane ke liye uskaa sir dhad se juda kar detaa tha
 For example, he had killed people when he suspected a man's conduct, or for not keeping a vessel out after eating a friend's fish, taking his rickshaw and giving it back by puncturing it or stealing his mobile
 ek saath mili thi do sajaaendilli police ne giraftaar ke baad 24 agast 2007 ko nichali adaalat main uske khilaaf chargeshit daakhil kii thi
 In the first charge sheet, he was accused of murdering six people
 26 agast 2007 ko police ne uske khilaaf duusari chargeshit daakhil kii
 In which he was accused of the seventh murder
 lekin paanch disambar 2007 ko adaalat ne sabooton ke abhaav main chandrakant jha ko katl ke ek cese main bari kar diya
 He came out on bail
 lekin phir 21 march 2008 ko adaalat ne pehali najar main use silsilewar katl kaa doshi mana or uske khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii ijaajat de di
 In 2013, he was sentenced to life imprisonment and life imprisonment
 lekin phir teen saal baad 27 janvari 2015 ko dilli hai court ne chandrakant jha kii maut kii sajaa ko umr kaid main badal diya tha

 jaankaron ke mutabik tab yah deal desh kii sabase badi miletry aircraft deal main se ek ho jaaegi jisaki keemat kareeb 1 lakh karod tak ho sakati he
 Last month, there was a deal to buy Rafale planes from Dassault, France, in which there was talk of buying 36 jets
 iske baad bhartiya vayusena chaahati he ki vah jald se jald anya adhigrahan ko anjaam de taaki desh kii samrik kshamta main izapha ho sake jo philhal china or pakistan se ek tihaai kam he
 However, PM Modi's administration wants any future military aircraft to be built in India in collaboration with an Indian partner so that the domestic aircraft industry can move forward and get rid of expensive imports
 tippaniyan Lockheed Martin says that he wants to start manufacturing in India for the F-16 Flein and he wants to do it not just for the Indian Army but also for export
 vahiin sweden ke saab ne apane gripen aircraft ke liye production line sthapit karne kaa prastaav diya he jo abhi tak kii sabase badi miletry plane deal main se ek ko takkar de sakati he
 The Air Force officer working on this under the Make in India scheme said, "at present, there is a shortage of 200 aircraft
 kam se kam itane kii jarurat to he hi
 ' ek or sarkari sutara ke mutabik bharat ke raksha mantralay ne kai companiyon ko single engine fiter plane ke liye desh main essembly line sthapit karne ke liye aamantrit kiya he
 These companies have been asked whether they are willing to set up a production line with technology transfer
 sutara ke anusaar 'ham videshi form kii ichhashakti dekhnaa chaahate hai ki kya vah vaaki main utpaadan kaa kaam yahaan karne ke liye taiyaar hai or unki apekshaayen kya hai
 ' pichley maheene france ke dasolt se rafel vimaanon ko kharide jane kii deal hui jisamen 36 jet kharidne kii hi baat ho pai
 After this, the Indian Air Force wants to carry out other acquisitions as soon as possible so as to increase the country's strategic capability, which is currently one third less than China and Pakistan
 haalanki piem modi kaa prashasan chahta he ki bhavishya main kisi bhi tarah ke sainya vimaan bharat main bhartiya partner ke saath milakar bana jaae taaki gharelu aircraft udyog ko aage badhaayaa ja sake or manhage aayaat se nijaat mil sake
 The comments lochid martin kaa kahana he ki vah F-16 flen ke liye bharat main nirmaan shuru karnaa chaahati he or yah kaam vah sirf bhartiya sena ke liye nahin balki niryaat ke liye bhi karnaa chaahate hai
 At the same time, Saab of Sweden has proposed to set up a production line for its Gripen aircraft which could compete with one of the largest military plane deals ever
 mek in india yojana ke tahat is par kaam karne vaale air force afasar ne kaha 'philhal to 200 aircraft kii kami he
 At least this much is needed
 ' According to another government source, the Defense Ministry of India has invited several companies to set up assembly lines in the country for a single engine fighter plane
 in companiyon se poocha gaya he ki kya vah takanic sthanantaran ke saath production line sthapit karne ke liye raji hai
 According to the source, "we want to see the will of the foreign firm whether it is really ready to do the production work here and what are their expectations
" ' Lockheed Martin says that he wants to start manufacturing in India for the F-16 Flein and he wants to do it not just for the Indian Army but also for export
 vahiin sweden ke saab ne apane gripen aircraft ke liye production line sthapit karne kaa prastaav diya he jo abhi tak kii sabase badi miletry plane deal main se ek ko takkar de sakati he

 "RRB NTPC Admit Card: The admit card for NTPC exam will not be released yet, this is the reason when asked whether the candidates will get a chance to correct the photo and sign," he said, "only after scrutiny the Railways Will be able to know whether the fault is from the railway or the candidates

 india today special investegative team ne apni tahakikat main cricket ke is kaale sach ko benakaab kiya he
 On Wednesday, on the eve of the One Day International match from New Zealand in Pune, the senior pitch curator was caught by undercover reporters in a hidden camera saying that pitch fixing can be done as and when required

 bataa den ki ICC or bhartiya cricket control board (BCCI) kii ore se bhrashtachar par roak lagane ke liye behad kade niyam hai
 There is also a strict ban on outsiders going to the field before the match
 saalganvkar naa sirf india today ke under cover reporters ko pune main pich tak le gaya balki unhen pich ko thok kar dekhne ke liye bhi kaha
 The most dangerous face of the curator was revealed when he also gave information that the pitch will play well in terms of batting
 yahaan ye bataanaa jaruri he ki andercover reporters ne curator se khud ko bookies bataate hue sampark kiya tha
 Salgaonkar said, 'this (pitch) is very good, i estimate 337 runs will be scored
 ‚Äôreporter-‚Äòkya tum pakkaa kah rahe ho?‚Äôsaalganvkar-‚Äòpakkaa or 337 ran kaa peechha kiya ja saktaa he
 It does not have any message
 ‚Äôjo saalganvkar ne kaha, use mana jaae to pune kii pich batsman ko badi mufeed rahegi or ran kaa ambara lagegaa
 Especially the hard hitting batsman will get the pitch
 yani bukis ke liye bhi un par bada daanv lagane kaa mauka

 Salgaonkar said that it is not allowed to do so
 bisisiai paryvekshak aasapaas hi baithe hai
 If tomorrow someone asks me, i will say that nobody came here

 After this, the curator also guaranteed to pitch the pitch according to one of the teams

 'salgaonkar-' can be done
 main aapako bataata hum ki ye 340 ran kii wicket he

 lekin ham (ek team) fevar chaahate hai
 'salgaonkar-' i already told you that it can be done well
 ‚Äô The Congress on Friday raised the question, what steps were taken to ensure the release of Sarabjit Singh while the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance is in power? The Congress said that now the government should focus on other Indians imprisoned in Pakistani jails

 Congress leader Manish Tiwari asked on Friday, 'when the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee went to Lahore, was Sarabjit's release his agenda? When the then President of Pakistan, Pervez Murshraf visited Agra, was Sarabjit's release an agenda? When the joint talks started, was Sarabjit's release his agenda? "he said," So don't judge these things

 Exciting matches were not seen in the World Cup so far, but this match of runs at the Chinnaswamy Stadium filled the gap where people breathed till the last ball
 bhartiya team 338 ran par banaakar out ho gayi thi lekin england ne aath wicket par 338 ran bana daale or is tarah se vishwa cap main chauthi baar koi match taai chuta
 Tendulkar played an outstanding innings of 120 off 115 balls at the Chinnaswamy Stadium
 unke alaava yuvaraj singh (58), gautam gambhir (51) or virendra sahvaag (35) ne bhi upyogi yogadan diya
 Indian innings 49, losing the last seven wickets within 24 balls
 5 over tak chali
 Strauss made his career-best, scoring 158 runs off 145 balls with the help of 18 fours and a six and in the meantime shared a 170-run partnership for the third wicket with Ian Bell (69)
 jahir khan ne apni chah gend ke andar teen wicket lekar england ko vishwa cap main sabase bada lakshya hasil karne se roka lekin straas kii team ne bharat ko puure do ank hasil nahin karne diye or donon tiimon ko ek ek ank se santosh karnaa padaa
 England needed 29 runs in the last two overs

 The final over required 14 runs, in which Ajmal Shahzad hit a six
 aakhri gend par do ran jeet ke liye chahie the lekin munaf ne keval ek ran diya
 Incarnation of Indian innings was Tendulkar's second against England, fifth in World Cup record, 47th in ODI and 98th in international cricket

 The spinners were also not able to leave much of an impact on those whose balls they sweep, cut, cover drive all the way
 unhone pari ke 29wein over main yuvaraj kii gend par chaukaa or phir do ran lekar vishwa cap main apana pehla or van de main chatha shatak puraa kiya
 England took the powerplay from the 43rd over

 In the next over, he scattered the kills of Paul Collingwood and turned the match in India's favor 
 bresanan(14) or greem swaan(15) ne haalanki bharat ko romaanchak jeet darj nahin karne di

 sahvaag ne iske baad kuch achche shaat lagaaye lekin pehle badlaav ke taur par aaye bresanan ne aate hi unki pari kaa ant kar diya
 Wicketkeeper Matt Prior dived to the right and caught him with one hand
 sahvaag ne 26 gend kheli or aath chauke lagaaye
 Tendulkar's bat aggression was seen only after this
 unhone collingwood ko nishane par rakhkar unke lagaataar over main chakke jamaaye or jab greem swaan gendbaaji ke liye aaye to unki lagaataar gend ko unhone long aan or midwicket par chah ran ke liye bheja

 gambhir ne isi over main gend chaar ran ke liye bhejkar ardhashatak puraa kiya lekin swaan kii gend line main aaye bina khilne ke kaaran vah bold ho gayi
 The king of records equaled Sourav Ganguly's (190) record of hitting the most sixes in odis for India by sending the Swan ball for six runs but took the Anderson ball in the third over of the powerplay taken from the 37th over
 In an effort to play on the side, he catches Yardi standing at cover
 yuvaraj lay main dikhe or unhone shuru main dhili gendon ko sabak sikhaane kii ranneeti apanaayi
 The left-handed batsman completed his 46th ODI half-century by hitting two fours in the 45th over with Shahzad, but in the next over of Yardi he caught the ball by waving the ball in the air
 dhoni ne shahzad par lagaataar do chauke jadkar haath khole or phir yardi kii gend midwicket par chah ran ke liye bheji lekin bresanan ke agle over main vah seemaa rekha par lapak liye gayi

 Mayawati, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national president, roared at the ITI ground in Hardoi at 1 pm on April 10, saying, "I belong to the Chamar caste
" agar 80 siton par bispi ke ummidavaar chunaav jitate hai to haath kiske majboot honge? aapaki bahan ke honge, aapaki beti ke honge, aapke samaaj kii ladki ke honge
 If these two Pasi win elections from here, no one will say that Pasi won
 sab yahi bolenge ki chamaar kii beti ke haath main do or siten aa gai hai
 Mayawati tried to give a new tone to electoral "social engineering" among the Dalit castes by referring to the subjugation of party candidates during the unified election campaign of Hardoi and Misrikh reserved parliamentary seats
 yah koshish bevajaah nahin thi
 Just 48 hours before this, Samajwadi Party (SP) BJP leader Ashok Pradhan of Jatav fraternity in western Uttar Pradesh and a week before Dr
 bhimrao ambedkar mahasabha ke rashtriya adhyaksh lalji prasad nirmal kaa samarthan hasil kar uttar pradesh kii dalit raajnneeti main jagah banane kii koshish shuru kar di thi
 Mayawati knows that the way to win maximum seats in UP goes through 17 reserved seats here
 so duusari partiyaan bhi inhen hathiyaane kii ranneeti bana rahi hai
 Under this, all parties have put a lot of effort in helping the Dalit vote bank
 aabaadi ke hisaab se desh ke sabase bade pradesh upi main daliton kii 21 fisadi se zyada aabaadi he
 Of the 80 Lok Sabha seats here, 17 may be reserved for the Scheduled Castes, but about 40 percent of the seats are such where their population is more than 25 percent
 aise main surakshit siton par rajnatik partiyon kii ranneeti duusari gaiyr-dalit jatiyon ko apane dalit ummidavaar ke saath jodgaye kii he
 Dalit thinker and Prof
 Govind Vallabh Pant Social Science Institute, Allahabad
 badri narayan kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòdaliton kii 66 upjatiyon main se aadha darjan ko hi rajnatik manch par jagah mil rahi he
 The rest are looking for a political place for themselves
 ‚Äô‚Äôsurakshit siton par soshal ejineeringambedkar jayanti par 14 april ko mayawati ne lakhanu ke mal avenue sthit apane awaas main dopaher teen baje press conference ke liye achaanak bulaava bheja
 On this occasion, Mayawati not only attacked bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi but also counted the work done for Dalits since the formation of BSP
 unka ishaara saaf tha
 Mayawati does not have any eye on the Dalit votes in UP
 pichley 20 saal ke dauraan sirf 1999 or 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bispi ne 5-5 surakshit siten hathiyaan thim
 In the last election, it came down to two
 is loksabhaa chunaav main behatar pradarshan kii ummid main mayawati ne dalit siton par soshal ejineering ijad kii he
 The Mayawati, with the help of the charmacar-jatav-pasi alliance, which constitutes about 70 per cent of the Dalit population, has made preparations to wave blue seats in reserved seats
 party ne 9 siton par jatav-charmkaar jati ke ummidavaaron ko chunaav main utaara he or chah siton par paasi ummidavaar khadey kiye hai
 Swami Prasad Maurya, leader of bsp's Legislature Party and state spokesperson, says, "in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the party was in second place on 13 of the 17 reserved seats and the margin of defeat was very small
 is baar sapa sarkaar main samaaj ke sabhi virgon ke saath daliton par ho rahe atyaachaar se janata bispi ke shashan ko yaad kar rahi he
 This will become clear in this election
 ‚Äô‚Äôpichhlaa pradarshan dohraane kii chunautisarkari naukariyon main pramotion main aarakshan kaa virodh kar daliton ke nishane par ai sapa ke saamne sabase badi chunauti apane pichley pradarshan ko dohraane kii he
 Last time, the party won 10 seats out of 17 reserved seats
 is varsh kii shuruyaat main daliton ke bich naaraazgi dur karne ke liye sapa sarkaar ne pradesh main anusuchit jati or janajati ke kaaphi samay se khaali pade padon par bhartee prakriya shuru kii
 Within ten days of the first phase of Lok Sabha elections, SP ran the cycle of election campaign by joining three big Dalit leaders in the party
 sapa kaa haath pakadaaey vaale ‚Äò‚Äòdow
 Bhimrao Ambedkar Mahasabha '' National President Dr
 lalji prasad nirmal kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòmayawati kii pichhali sarkaar ne anusuchit jati atyaachaar nivaaran adhinium main turant exiar ke praavdhaan ko hataakar ise kamjor kar diya
 Mayawati's intention behind giving reservations to Dalit hostels in general and imposing reservation in promotion by not following the legal rules is now understood as Dalit
 is chunaav main sapa inhen muddon ko saamne laa rahi he
 "seeing the bsp's hold in the Jatav-tanners castes, the SP has relied on other castes to cut them
" party ne keval do siton par jatav-charmkaar ummidavaar utaare hai
 Apart from giving tickets to the Pasi leaders in the maximum seven seats, the Dhanuk and Valmiki castes have also been given place in the electoral battle to capture local equations
 sabhi jute hai daliton ko manaane menmishan modi kii kamyaabi ke liye bijepi ko pichde, ati or pichhadon ke saath daliton ke samarthan kii bhi darkaar he
 This was the magic of the Dalit vote bank, when in the 1996 Lok Sabha elections, the lotus was on 14 reserved seats
 lekin iske baad lagaataar party daliton se dur hoti gai, jiskaa asar chunaav nateezon main bhi dikhaa
 Ramnaresh Rawat, former president of the BJP Scheduled Caste Front, says, "since supporting Mayawati, the Dalits associated with the party had moved to BSP
 ‚Äô‚Äôpichley saal disambar main paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon main kul 79 vidhansabha siton main se 70 par kesaria lahraane se upi main bijepi ke hausale buland hai
 The party has now also hoped to garner the support of Dalits in UP in the Lok Sabha elections
 rajya main mayawati se naaraaz kanshiram samarthak daliton kaa samarthan jutaney ke liye bijepi ne kendriya karyaalay main kanshiram kaa chitra taangna shuru kar diya
 On January 15, Sanjay Paswan, in-charge of the BJP Scheduled Caste Front, promised to award Bharat Ratna posthumously after visiting the village of Kanshi Ram in Punjab to form the party's government
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa aanushanbik sanghathan seva bharti gaanvon main chaoupal lagaakar ambedkar, jagjivan ram or kanshiram ko dalit iken ke rup main pesh kar rahaa he
 In this way, indirect efforts are being made to mobilize Dalit votes in favor of BJP
 party ne indian justise party ke rashtriya adhyaksh or naukareepesha dalit adhikariyon or karmchaariyon main paith rakhane vaale uditraj ko apane saath joda he taaki pramotion main aarakshan ke mudde par party se naaraaz daliton ko manaaya ja sake
 On 8 October last year, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi took on Mayawati in a program of scheduled caste empowerment in New Delhi to break up Dalits from BSP
 ve bole, ‚Äò‚Äòmayawati ne dalit netritv par apana kabja kar liya he or ve duusare netaaon ko aage nahin aane deteen
 "about five months before the announcement of the Lok Sabha elections, this statement of Rahul Gandhi pointed to the main opposition party in the battle to grab the Dalit votes in UP
" yah baat tab or saaf ho gai, jab bispi kii hi tarj par congress ne bhi nau siton par jatav-charmkaar ummidavaar utaar die or dalit voton ke liye sidhi ladaai kaa elaan kar diya
 National Scheduled Castes Commission Chairman P
 el
 Poonia says, "mayawati remembers Jatavs and tanner castes only during elections
 bispi shashan main hi inkaa sabase zyada utpeeda hua, jabaki rahul gandhi lagaataar har manch par daliton ko barabari dilaane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Rahul has fielded BSP founder member Balihari Babu from Lalganj safe seat
 saath hi kanshiram ke sahyogi rahe dalit netaa raajbahadur ko daliton ke bich party kii paith badhaane kii jimmedaari saunp di he
 "the Dalit section is troubled by Mayawati's policies and is now looking at the Congress as an alternative," says Balihari Babu
 ‚Äô‚Äôrajnatik partiyon kii khmebandi se bekhbar barabanki jile ke deva block main daliton ke sabase bade gaanv gauraiya main to aazaadee ke baad pehali baar bijli chamakane kii aas ek baar phir jaagi he
 This time some stone pillars have also gone wrong

 bharat ne 1991 main shuru udaarikaran ke daur main apni arthvyavastha ko pratyaksh videshi nivesh (FDI) ke liye kholaa tha or uske baad se hi ise hasil karne ke liye aakraamak prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 In the last week itself, FDI policy has been further liberalized and simplified so that trade in the country becomes smooth and FDI flows increase
 epadiai kii maatra to lagaataar bad rahi he, lekin iske aankadon kaa gaharaai se vishleshan karne par kai nae tathy saamne aate hai
 The idea behind increasing FDI flows is to increase investment, income and employment of people in the country
 lekin pichley varshon main is baat ke akalan kii koshish nahin kii gai ki is puunji kaa vastav main koi phayda hua he yaa nahin or vastav main jis uddeshy se epadiai ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he, vah puraa bhi ho rahaa he yaa nahin
 According to the official data on the growth rate of FDI inflows after 2008-09, gross FDI inflows (equity, reinvested earnings and other capital) increased from Rs 17,557 crores in 2000-01 to 4 in 2018-19
 49,616 crores has reached Rs
 isamen equity kaa hissaa is dauraan 10,733 karod rupee se badhkar 3,09,867 karod rupee tak pahunch gaya he
 But in terms of annual growth in FDI inflow or percentage of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), FDI inflow ie FDI inflow has come down drastically since 2008-09
 iskaa matlab yah he ki 2014 ke mek in india abhiyaan se bhi isamen teji nahin aa pai he
 GFCF means how much of the new money that has come into the economy has been invested (not consumed), which means it is an indicator of investment
 epadiai or epadiai equity inflo main salanaa badhat saal 2016-17 main ek ank main pahunch gai or 2018-19 main to isamen giravat aa gai
 Some More Negative Signs Another important trend in terms of FDI is repatriation and reinvestment earnings, which is the income that comes back to the Indian economy
 yani epadiai se koi videshi company agar bharat se kamai kar rahi he to vah phir yahaan kitna nivesh kar rahi he or epadiai se apni kamai kaa kitna hissaa yahaan nae sire se nivesh kar rahi he
 In this case both signs are negative
 iskaa matlab yah he ki ab zyada se zyada puunji baahar ja rahi he or isse bhartiya arthvyavastha main epadiai ke sambhavit phaaydon kaa ksharan ho rahaa he
 Income repatriation was quite low till 2008-09, but it increased to 17 of FDI equity inflows in 2009-10
 9 fisadi or 2017-18 main 48 fisadi tak pahunch gaya
 Increasing repatriation means more capital is going out of the Indian economy
 isi tarah rienvested arning 2002-03 main epadiai equity inflo kaa 60 fisadi tak tha, lekin 2017-18 main yah ghatakar mahaj 28 fisadi rah gaya
 This means that companies are taking more and more profits out of the country
 epadiai inflo kaa kya phayda, kam milte hai aankadeepadai hasil karne kaa matlab sirf videshi puunji hasil karnaa nahin hota he
 In the 1991 Industrial Policy, the then government said that the idea behind opening the economy to FDI is to 'get the benefit of technology transfer, marketing experts, gain modern managerial technology and create new possibilities to boost exports
 '2017 main jari epadiai statement bhi yah bhi kaha gaya ki isamen aarthinc tarakkee ko badhaava dene kii sambhaavna bhi honi chahie
 But the government has no answer to whether these benefits have been given to India or not
 hameshaa bas isi baat par jor diya gaya ki kitni epadiai aa rahi he
 For example, in the budget speech for the year 2013-14, the then government honestly accepted that FDI is necessary to cover the current account deficit (CAD)
 iske baad se lagaataar yah daawa kiya jaataa rahaa he ki epadiai se menuphaccharing or rojgaar ko badhaava mil rahaa he, lekin loksabhaa main kai baar sarkaar ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki uske paas aise daavon ko pukhta karne vaale koi aankade nahin hai
 Chalapathi Rao, a professor at the Institute for Studies in Industrial Development, who has studied FDI for many decades, said, "there is no system to know if there is any good in the country, especially on the issue of technology transfer and employment
" ‚Äôniti ayog kii saal 2018 kii ek report new india@75 main kaha gaya he, ‚Äòbharat ko yadi duniya kaa workshop bananaa he to hamen menuphaccharing main epadiai ko badhaava dena hoga
 'more FDIFDI equity inflow data in service sector has revealed another information that a large proportion of FDI equity is replaced by manufacturing services (34%, automobiles, chemicals, medicines etc
) rather than services (65
 4% , vittiya sevaayen, software, telecommunication, construction aadi) main aayaa he
 Not only this, about half of the FDI equity in manufacturing is going to buy the existing business and not to set up any new capacity
 professor raav kehete hai ki unke study se yah pataa chalaa he ki 2004 se 2014 ke bich menuphaccharing main aae vaastavik epadiai equity inflo kaa kareeb 55 fisadi hissaa maujuuda kaarkaanon ko kharidne yaa maujuuda niveshkon ke adhigrahan main laga he
 This has not created any kind of capacity or employment

 What is the role of the Diwan of the Dargah? The Diwan of the Dargah is a descendant of Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti and he is traditionally welcome to attend the Dargah of a patriarch
 dargah market association bhi khafadargah market association ke adhyaksh jodha tekchandani ne kaha, ‚Äòsuraksha sambandhi kaarnon se ativishisht hastiyon ke daure ke samay bazaar band rahata he, lekin is baar ham jila prashasan dwaara tay samay se pehle, apni marji se dukaane band kar rahe hai
 'he said,' This is to register his protest against the visit of the Prime Minister of Pakistan

 He said, 'foreign Minister Salman Khurshid is organizing a lunch for Ashraf which is shameful
 unhen is tarah unka swaagat nahin karnaa chahie
