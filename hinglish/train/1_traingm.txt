 16 years ago, after two months of fighting, Pakistani intruders were killed by our army personnel
 alag baat he ki isaki keemat kareeb 500 javaanon ko apni jaan dekar chukaani padi
 The whole country is remembering the sacrifices made by the soldiers and how Prime Minister Narendra Modi would stay behind when the country is saluting the martyrs
 unhone twit karke kaha ki "kargil vijay diwas hamaari sena ke shaury, parakram or balidaan kii yaad dilaataa he
 Salutations to the immortal martyrs who invoked all the homeland

 Social activist Anna Hazare also reached out to support the ex-servicemen
 anna ne sarkaar par hamale karne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 Said, Raghukul Reet always came to pran jay but promise, directly targeted the government by saying this and said that you promised to give one rank one pension to the soldiers, then why not fulfill it
 bhrashtrachaar mitaane kaa vaada kiya, lokapal laane kaa vaada kiya or kuch bhi puraa nahin kiya
 Anna Hazare said that if the Central Government is thinking that it is in the majority and cannot do any harm to it then it is in misunderstanding
 har din ke saath uskaa nuksaan badhata ja rahaa he or ek din use badi haani kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 Anna condemned the government for this, so far no government representative came to take care of the soldiers sitting in hunger strike
 vaise anna jab jantar-mantar par pahunche to vahaan par do-do manch dekhakar anchabhit jarur hue

 At the same time, Lieutenant General Raj Kadian, who leads the second platform, says that Anna had no idea about this and he went to where the organizer said, it would have been better if the government had gathered more pressure

 a pilgrimage center is located about 45 kilometers from Allahabad
 puranic kathaon ke anusaar vanvaas ke samay ram, sita or lakshmana ko yaheen nishad raja yani mallahon ke raja ne aashray diya tha
 The ghat here is full of dirt

 The legislators are from the Samajwadi Party
 gaanv vaale shikaayat karte hai ki na to saansad mahoday ne or na hi vidhayak ji ne yahaan se gandagi saaf karne main koi ruchi dikhaai he
 Surendra Nishad, a local guide says, 'recently Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the Nishad saying that a satellite of India was named Navik (navigation with Indian Constellation) to honor the contribution of Nishad society to the country

 But for political parties, issues related to people's interests have never been so irrelevant as in these 17 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh where voting is to be held on Saturday and then on Wednesday
 yahaan keval logon kii jati kaa hi mahatv he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP almost swept the area as the number of Other Backward Classes (obcs) and Extremely Backward Classes (mbcs) is about 40 percent of the total population of the area
 inamen yadav bhi shaamil hai jo samaajawaadee party (sapa) kaa samarthan karte hai
 Apart from these, there are about 200 groups, which are once again eyeing the BJP
 lekin 2017 main mayawati kii bispi or mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii sapa ke alaava kuch anya jati aadhaarit raajnneetik dal bhi maidan main hai jo is vot bank main send lagane main lage hai
 One such political party based in Gorakhpur is the Nirmal Indian Shoshit Aam Dal (NISHAD), which is headed by former homeopathy doctor Sanjay Nishad
 inkaa daawa he ki upi kii aabaadi main kareeb 2 fisadi kii sankhya vaale nishad samaaj kaa bada hissaa unki party kaa samarthak he
 Dr, who is trying his luck in the election from Gorakhpur Rural seat, where about one lakh people of Nishad community live
 nishad kehete hai, 'sabhi partiyon ne keval hamaara shoshan kiya he or hamaare samaaj ko koi bhi raajnneetik laabh nahin mila
 Nishad mlas and mps rarely get representation in the state or central cabinet
 ab hamen hamaara bakaayaa chahie
 But he confesses that unless the majority of up's backward classes are united and form their own front, they cannot expect power
 vah kehete hai, 'jiskaa dal hota he uskaa bal hota he

 These include Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party led by Om Prakash Rajbhar which has a hold over Rajbhar caste and Apna Dal which is Kurmi caste party which has around 3 in the state
 5 fisadi aabaadi he or jisaki pramukh anupriya patel centre main mantri hai
 But bjp's trump card was PM Modi himself
 obisi netaa ke rup main narendra modi (jo taili jati se aate hai) ko pesh karke or vikaas ke majboot agenda ke saath bijepi bikhare hue pichde voton ko apane paksh main karne main kaamyaab rahi - use ati pichhadon main kareeb 60 fisadi kaa jabardast samarthan mila
 This was not the first time that BJP had recognized the ability of the obcs as a highly empowered vote bank
 1980 ke dashak ke aakhir main ayodhya main ram mandir ke liye andolan ke dauraan vah badi sankhya main ekajute hue the, lekin andolan kaa netritv obisi netaaon kalyaan singh or uma bharti ko de diya gaya jo lodh jati ke hai
 Kalyan Singh became the Chief Minister of UP twice, first in 1991 and then in 1997
 dhire-dhire ram mandir nirmaan andolan kamjor pad gaya or bijepi ke haath se satta chali gai or pichhadi jatiyon par isaki pakad bhi dhili pad gai or wo mayawati or samaajawaadee party kii taraf chale gaye
 Once again, the challenge before the BJP is to maintain this vote bank after 2014
 party ne ati pichde varg ke netaaon ko mahatvapurn pad dekar isaki neenv rakhni shuru kii
 For example, Keshav Prasad Maurya, who belongs to the Kushwaha caste and is a Lok Sabha MP, was made the state president by the party 
 saath hi party adhyaksh amit shah ne samajawadi party ke kai obisi netaaon ko bijepi main shaamil karaayaa to saath hi basapa ke bhi kai diggaj party se jude
 These include Swami Prasad Maurya, considered the face of the backward classes in the BSP in UP
 is bich main akhilesh yadav ne 17 ati pichhadi jatiyon ko anusuchit jatiyon kii suchi main shaamil karne ko manjuuri de di, jisase ye jatiyaan centre sarkaar kii kalyaan yojanaon or vanchit virgon ke liye arakshit naukariyon ke liye yogya ho gayi
 To counter Akhilesh's move, BJP is promising 27 per cent reservation for the backward in government jobs and government education institutions, currently it is being given to other backward classes
 party ne ati pichhadaa varg or gaiyr yadav pichhadaa varg se kareeb 170 ummidavaar chunaav maidan main utaare hai jo iske virodhiyon kii tulana main kahin zyada hai
 The comments lekin varanasi main kurmi jati ke bich prasiddh ek hanuman mandir main chote kisaanon kaa ek samooh bijepi ko lekar sashankit he
 He says, 'we would have voted for Modi if he had deposited the money in our bank accounts so that we could make up for the loss caused by demonetisation, not because BJP gave the Kurmi leader a higher position in the party or more people of our caste Gave tickets jati mahatvapurn he lekin kuch mahatvapurn taatkaalik jaruratein hai jo usase pare hai

 Vinay Kumar, a 30-year-old mason of the Kumhar caste, says, "if you go round the Labor Chowk in Mirzapur, you will find that most of the workers come from the very backward classes
 kisi ne hamaare liye kuch nahin kiya
 Now BJP is saying, 'we are the right party for the Extremely Backward Classes'
 ' maine modi ji ke liye vot diya tha lekin meri mazdooree main ab tak koi badhotaree nahin hui

 lekin bijepi kaa trump card piem modi khud the
 By introducing Narendra Modi (who hails from Teli Jati) as an OBC leader and with a strong development agenda, the BJP managed to get the scattered backward votes in its favor - it got overwhelming support of around 60 per cent among the most backward
 
 yah pehali baar nahin tha jab bijepi ne ati shashakt vot bank ke rup main ati pichhadaa varg kii kshamta ko pahachaanaa tha
 He was united in large numbers during the agitation for the Ram temple in Ayodhya in the late 1980s, but the movement was led by OBC leaders Kalyan Singh and Uma Bharti, who belong to the Lodh caste
 kalyaan singh do baar upi ke mukhyamantri bane, pehali baar 1991 main or phir 1997 main
 Gradually, the Ram temple construction movement weakened and the BJP lost power and its grip on the backward castes also became loose and they moved towards Mayawati and Samajwadi Party

 Prasad Verma and Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Mulayam Singh Yadav are now staunch opponents
 lakhanu se 120 kimi dur gonda sansadeey kshetra ke kuch naaraaz log 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main apane saansad 72 varshiya verma kaa munh nahin dekhnaa chaahate, lekin 16 march ko gonda ke mujehana vidhansabha kshetra main yojit indian telecom industry (itii) ke shilanyas kaarykram main, benny gonda kii jaan hai, benny congress kii shaan hai or benny kaa keval ek hi mishan, rahul ko banaaen desh kaa piem jaise naare gunj rahe the
 Overwhelmed by the huge crowd and echoing slogans, Beni braved his statement and said, "mulayam is the biggest cheater, he is a robber
" inke aatankiyon ke saath rishte hai
 They want to get me killed
 '' phir kya tha
 Effigies of Beni started being burnt on the streets of UP, there was a stir in Parliament
 rajnatik samikarnon ke taar judye lage
 For the first time since Beni's leaving the SP, Mulayam Singh opened a front against him and stood firm on his dismissal from the government
 verma kii pahchaan ab bhale hi badbhole netaa ke taur par hoti ho, lekin 1970 main ken union bujwal ramnagar, barabanki ke sanchaalak or upasabhapati pad par nirvaachit hokar apana rajnatik safar shuru karne vaale benny kii chhavi jujharu samaajawaadee netaa kii thi
 In 1974, he became an MLA for the first time on an Indian Lok Dal ticket
 lakhanu uniwarsity se lau graduate benny pehali baar 1979 main janata party kii sarkaar main ganna vikaas, chini udyog evam karagaar sudhaar vibhaag ke mantri bane
 At the same time, the closeness between Beni and Mulayam Singh increased
 1989 main pradesh main mulaayam singh ke netritv main janata dal kii sarkaar banane par benny ko saarvajanik nirmaan or sansadeey kaary mantri ke rup main number do kii haisiyat mili
 In 1992, when SP was formed under the chairmanship of Mulayam Singh, Beni became the national general secretary of the party
 rajnatik vishleshak abhaya kumaar kehete hai, ''samaajawaadee party mukhya rup se pichde varg kii party thi
 While Mulayam had the support of the Yadavs in the backward classes, Beni emerged as the unanimous leader of the Kurmis
 '' 1996 ke loksabhaa chunaav main benny ne sapa ke tikat par kaisarganj se chunaav jeeta or mulaayam ke saath centre kii raajnneeti main apni maujuudagi dikhaai
 Between 1996 and 1998, he served as the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and then the Cabinet Minister in the United Front government at the Center
 2004 main benny chauthi baar kaisarganj se saansad chune gaye
 At this time there was SP government in UP and this was the time when the distance between Beni and Mulayam started increasing
 pradesh congress kii jonal koordination cameti ke ko-chairman or benny ke najdiki je
 P
 singh kehete hai, ''donon ke rishte tuutane ke peeche amar singh kaa haath tha
 a senior SP leader says that Amar Singh was pitting Waqar Ahmed Shah in Bahraich and Arvind Singh Gop in Barabanki against Beni
 isse naaraaz hokar unhone 2007 main party se naata tod liya or apni party 'samaajawaadee kranti dal' (escedi) banaai
 Beni fought from Ayodhya in the 2007 assembly elections and could not even save his bail
 udhar, upi main paanv majboot karne kii koshish main juty congress ke paas pichde varg kaa koi bada netaa nahin tha or isi majaburi ne congress or benny kaa milan karaayaa
 Beni joined the Congress in 2008
 2009 main unhone apni puraani seat kaisarganj kii jagah 15 fisadi kurmi matadaata vaale sansadeey kshetra gonda se chunaav ladaa
 The math of the votes in the election fit in Benny's favor and he won the election
 2012 ke vidhasabha chunaav main pichde varg ke vot bank ko apni ore khinchne ke liye congress ne benny ko hi aage kiya
 In 2011, Beni was made the Minister of State (independent Charge) in the Ministry of Steel and in 2011, he was elevated to the Cabinet Minister in the Ministry of Steel before the 2012 Assembly elections
 benny ke rup main kangeras kaa pichhadaa card vidhansabha chunaav main flop sabit hua
 The Congress did not get a single seat in the Kurmi dominions like Gonda, Barabanki and Beni's hold areas
 gonda ke ek sevanivrutt professor, 65 varshiya espi mishra kehete hai, ''benny ab bhi pichhadon ke sarvamaanya netaa nahin ban sake hai
 He has only the support of the Kurmi fraternity of Gonda, Barabanki
 '' iske alaava ve masauli dangon kaa daag bhi nahin dho paae
 Beni has once again risen from the dust of bad assembly elections
 ve pichley chah maheene ke dauraan gonda main ek darjan sabhaayen kar 20,000 karod ru
 Have announced plans for lekin in sabhaaon main zyaadaatar surkhiyaan mulaayam ko lekar benny ke bayanon ne hi batori hai
 In January, the Akhilesh government reduced the security of the z category given to Beni to the x category
 yahi nahin, farvari main hue upi sarkaar ke mantriparishad vistaar main gonda se mantriyon kii sankhya ek kii jagah teen karke benny ko gherne kii ranneeti banaai to mulaayam ke khilaaf unka paara charam par pahunch gaya

 New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori praised his bowlers and fielders after defeating South Africa in the quarter-finals of the Cricket World Cup and said that his team returned to the match after AB de Villiers and Jacques Kallis took wickets
 newjilandne aath wicket par 221 ran banaakar dakshin africa ko keval 173 ran par samet diya or 49 ran se jeet darj kar semifinal main pravesh kiya
 Vettori credited the victory to the bowlers and excellent fielding
 unhone kaha, ‘har gendbaaj ne apana sarvshereshth pradarshan kiya or shandaar kshetrarakshan se ham match jeet sake
 De Villiers had a great run-out
 martin guptil bhi adbhut rahe
 The New Zealand captain, however, admitted that the 220-run score was not competitive
 unhone kaha, ‘221 ran banane ke baad ham jaanate the ki hamen gendbaaji main aakraamak hona hoga
 We should have scored 250 runs on this pitch
 kalis or divilliars jab tak krij par the, ham kuch nahin kah sakate the
 But we returned after both were out
 ’vahindkshin africake captain greem smith is haar se kaaphi niraash the or unhone kaha, ‘main jo mahasoos kar rahaa hum, use shabdon main bayaan nahin kiya ja saktaa

 ’smith ne haar ke liye lagaataar antaraal par ganvaaye wicket ko jimmedaar tehraaya or kaha, ‘mujhe laga tha ki hamane thik thaak gendbaaji kii thi
 But we lost wickets quickly while batting
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘jesi rider or raas tailor ke bich saajhedaari se newjiland 220 ran kaa scorebanane main safal rahaa
 However, this goal was achievable
 lekin hamane lagaataar wicket ganvaa diye
 Asked about losing wickets at such frequent intervals in the knockout round of the World Cup, Smith said, "I don't know why we lose wickets like this in the World Cup knockout
" yah 1992 ke baad se ho rahaa he
 But we will also take some positive things from the World Cup
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ham aaj acha nahin kar paye lekin hamen bhavishya main team ko aage le janaa he

 endie sarkaar kaa antim purna bajet pesh karne se pehle vitt mantri arun jetali ke saamne kai chunautiyaan hai
 If the government wants to revive the slowed economy after demonetisation and GST, then investors also have to be attracted
 iske alaava agle saal hone vaale loksabhaa chunaavon or kai rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle matadaataaon ko lubhaana bhi sarkaar kii praathamiktaaon main hoga
 However, this task will not be easy for the government
 niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh rajeev kumaar ne anumaan jataayaa he ki vittiya varsh 2017-18 ke liye rajkoshiya ghaataa bajet anumaan se adhik rah saktaa he
 He said that the government's disinvestment and non-tax revenue collection has offset this to some extent, but if populist announcements are made in the budget, the government may suffer
 jaaniye sarkaar ke kis kadam se use kitna bhaar uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Income tax exemption limit 2
 5 lakh se 3 lakh rupee karne parais samay 2
 Annual income up to Rs 5 lakh is tax free
 ise badhaakar 3 lakh rupee karne kii maang ho rahi he
 Most people are eyeing this slab, because there was no change in it last time too
 aapaki 50,000 rupee salanaa kii aay ko tex free karne se isapar lagane vaale 5 fisadi byaaj kii dar se aap har saal 2,500 rupee bachaa sakenge yani har maheene kareeb 200 rupee
 There are about 2 crore income tax payers in this slab
 chhot kii seemaa 50,000 rupaya badhaane par sarkaar ko lagbhag 5,300 karod rupee ke nuksaan kaa anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he
 That is, the government will have to bear a loss of Rs 5,300 crore if you save Rs 200
 80C kii seemaa 1
 5 lakh to 2 lakh rupees, this time taxpayers 1 under Section 80C of Income Tax
 5 lakh rupee tak kii chhot milti he
 There is a demand to increase this to Rs 2 lakh
 aisa hua to 50 lakh karadaata har saal 50,000 yaa usase zyada rupee bachaa sakenge
 This will make about Rs 25,000 crore tax free every year
 agar is par 10
 If the tax is estimated at the rate of 3 percent, then the government will incur a loss of Rs 2,575 crore
 teen iskar slab main badlaav karne parais samay desh main teen iskar slab hai
 2 in the first slab
 5 lakh rupee tak kii salanaa aay tex free he
 2
 5 lakh se 5 lakh rupee salanaa aay par 5 fisadi tex lagata he
 Those with an annual income of 5 lakh to 10 lakh are taxed 20%
 10 lakh rupee salanaa se zyada kii vaarshik aay par 30 fisadi tex kaa praavdhaan he
 Presently, the number of taxpayers with annual 5 lakh rupees 6
 22 lakh he
 Therefore, if the income tax slab of 10% was increased to 6 lakhs, then every year the government would get about 640 crore less in income tax collection
 agar 20% ke slab ko badhaakar 12 lakh rupee kiya jaataa he to har saal sarkaar ko lagbhag 520 karod rupee kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 With the removal of surcharge on income tax, the Indian government levies a surcharge of 10% on annual income of more than Rs 50 lakh
 1 karod rupee se zyada kii aay par sarcharge badhkar 15% fisadi ho jaataa he
 If the government removes surcharge on higher income in this budget, then the government is estimated to lose about Rs 3,500 crore every year

 You may be surprised to hear this, but it is true that married men also flirt
 yahaan tak kii kuch shaadishuda auraten bhi aisa karti hai
 As long as these things remain till the talk, then it is still fine, but it should also have a limit
 flert karne se aatm-vishwaas badhata he or phir insaan har roj ek kadam aage badhane lagata he
 It is good to stop such people in the beginning but there are some who do not stop despite expressing disagreement
 unki ye aadat har roj kuch badhati jaati he or phir baatcheet se aage badhkar ye chune yaa phir ashleel baton tak pahunch jaati he
 In such a situation, it becomes quite stressful
 par shant baithna iskaa upaay nahin he
 Do not give anyone the right to make them unhappy
 agar aapako us shaks kaa aisi baaten karnaa pasand nahin he to use sakhti ke saath manaa kar den
 Along with this, you can also adopt these methods to stop it: 1
 uski baton se khush na honhar ladki or mahila ko apni tarif sunanaa acha lagata he lekin agar koi shaadishuda mard aapse flert kar rahaa he to uski baaten sunakar bilkul bhi khush na hon
 Your positive attitude may give him a wrong signal
 use aisa lag saktaa he ki aap bhi uske pyaar main he
 Thinking like this, he will never control his antics, but will only increase his limits
 2
 Remind him that if he is married, if a married man is flirting with you, remind him that he is married
 ye ek cheez aapako sabase pehle uske saamne rakhni chahie ki wo kisi kaa pati he
 Maybe she stops flirting when she realizes this
 3
 Say it clearly, if a person is flirting with you despite being married and you do not like his actions, then you can refuse him clearly
 aisa kehane main aapako kisi bhi tarah kii jhijak nahin honi chahie
 4
 dobaaraa na karne kii salaah deni chahinagar koishadishuda mard aapse flert karne kii koshish kar rahaa haito uski pehali koshish ke baad hi use manaa kar den
 Tell him clearly that you do not like all this and he should not talk to you like this
 5
 If you think that despite explaining your lac, that person is not understanding anything, then you can warn him
 aap use kah sakati hai kiap uski patni se ye baat kah dengi
 Despite this, if a person continues to harass you, then you can also take help of the police
