 england main khele ja rahe maujuuda world cap main mahaj do din ke antaraal main do bade record tut chuke hai
 In the match between Australia and Bangladesh on 20 June, both teams scored a total of 714 runs
 ye isisi world cap ke kisi match main sabase zyada ran kaa record he
 Australia scored 381 runs for 5 wickets in the first match in this match
 bangladesh ne fiting spirit dikhaate hue australia ke score kaa peechha karne kii koshish kii, lekin wo 8 wicket par 333 ran ke score tak hi pahunch paaya or match haar gaya
 Three days ago, the match between England and Afghanistan also recorded the record of the most runs scored by a bowler
 isisi vanade ranking main duniya ke number teen bowler or afghanistan ke spinner raashid khan ne 9 over phenke or bina koi wicket liye 110 ran lutaa daale
 It is the most expensive spell of any bowler in any World Cup match
 jahaan tak sabhi vanade international muqablon kii baat he to raashid kaa ye spel doosraa sabase kharchila he
 Both these records of the current World Cup proves that the pitches here are more favorable to the batsmen than the bowlers
 agar yahi trend aage bhi jari rahata he to bahut sambhaavna he ki kisi ek world cap main sabase zyada ran banane kaa sachin tendulkar kaa 16 saal purana record bhi dharashayi ho saktaa he
 In the 2003 World Cup, Tendulkar scored 673 runs
 maujuuda world cap main ab tak jo do top scorer hai wo 400 se zyada ran kuta chuke hai or abhi kai match khele jane baaki hai
 Australia opener David Warner is the top-ranked batsman in the list of runs scored so far
 warner ab tak 6 match main 440 ran bana chuke hai
 Next to Warner is Shakib Al Hasan of Bangladesh at number two
 shaakib ab tak 6 match main 425 ran bana chuke hai
 Please tell that a match of Bangladesh was washed out due to rain, so Shakib got the opportunity to bat in 5 innings so far
 warner or shaakib ko ab bhi lig stage ke teen-teen match khelnaa baaki he
 Warner's opening partner and Australia captain Aaron Finch has scored 396 runs so far
 is world cap ke ab tak ke top 5 batsman main england ke jo root or bharat ke upakptain rohit sharma bhi shaamil hai
 Who can break Sachin's record in these 5 batsmen? The Data Intelligence Unit of India Today Group analyzed the scoring pattern of the top 5 batsmen of the tournament so far
 ye jaanane kii koshish rahi ki agar wo isi lay (ausat ran / match) se ran banaate rahe to saare lig match khatm hone ke baad wo kitne kitne ran bana paaenge or in batsman main koun tendulkar kaa record tod saktaa he
 According to DIU calculations, Rohit Sharma and Shakib Al Hasan can cross the 673-run mark after the league stage provided they have retained their scoring average in the rest of the league matches
 bharat ne ab tak is world cap main 4 match khele hai jinamein se 1 varsha kii vajah se dhul gaya
 In this way, Rohit got the opportunity to bat in three matches so far
 rohit ab tak 106 ran prati match ausat ke hisaab se 319 ran bana chuke hai
 If they continue this average even further, by the end of the league stage they can score more than 850 runs
 bharat ko maujuuda vishwa cap main abhi lig stage ke 5 or match khilne hai
 Similarly, Shakib has scored 425 runs in 4 matches in 5 matches so far
 bangladesh ko abhi teen lig match or khilne hai
 If Shakib continues to play at the current average, he can easily cross the 673-run mark
 australian openar warner apane maujuuda scoring ausat se 673 ran kaa aankada mahaj 3 ran se chook sakate hai
 Finch and Root will have to increase their scoring average to surpass Tendulkar's record
 nahin to wo ‘673’ se kai ran se peeche chhot sakate hai
 Apart from this, if the teams of these players reach the stage of the semi-finals and finals, then it will be easier for them to break the 16-year-old record of Tendulkar

 The continuous ceasefire violations since the loc visit of Pakistani Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and the six terrorist attacks in the Kashmir Valley within the last six hours have once again raised questions

 koun kis seat se ladega or kiskaa tikat kategaa ? is par sabaki nigahen lagi hui hai
 The Congress, speeding up this work, issued its first list, which included 5 of the 48 seats in Maharashtra, 3 days after the election announcement
 inamen nagpur loksabhaa seat par congress ne nanabhau patole ko utaara he jo sambhavit bijepi pratyaashee kendriya mantri nitin gadakari se muqabla karenge
 He is the same Nana Patole who resigned from the post of MP after being angry with the behavior of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and later joined the Congress
 congress ne buudhvaar ko 21 siton par ummidavaaron kii duusari suchi jari kii thi jinamein uttar pradesh ke 16 or maharashtra ke 5 naam hai
 It consists of two BJP mps elected in the last Lok Sabha

 Both resigned from BJP and joined Congress

 Who is Nanabhau Patole: Patole, who had earlier stayed away from the Shiv Sena, joined the Congress, but won the Bhandara District Council elections in 1992 by contesting as an independent against party candidate Madhukar Leechde
 jald hi ve phir se congress main laut aae
 Nanabhau Patole, from Lakhandur constituency, stood against the party candidate Pramila, but the victory was won by bjp's Dayaram
 congress main vaapasi ke saath patole ne 1999 or 2004 ke vidhansabha chunaav main lakhdur jeet hasil kii
 In 2009, Patole resigned from the Congress on the issue of development of farmers and Vidarbha
 unhone nirdaleey ummidavaar ke taur par loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladaa or doosraa sthaan hasil kiya
 In this election, Praful Patel of NCP won, while BJP MP Shishupal Patle came third
 bijepi main jwoin kar jeeta chunaaviske baad patole ne bijepi jwoin kar lee or 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sacoli seat se jeet hasil kii
 Patole was elected the deputy leader of the BJP in the assembly
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main patole ne ensipi ummidavaar prafull patel ko haraaya
 Three and a half years after the allegations of Patole on PM Modi, Nanabhau Patole started targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 sitambar 2017 main patole ne nagpur main hue ek kaarykram main aarope lagaaya ki piem modi kisi kii bhi baat nahin sunate or party baithak main piem ne unhen us vakt apni baat nahin rakhane di thi, jab wo kisaanon kaa mudda uthaa rahe the
 After that, Patole started to talk about the BJP government in Maharashtra
 piem modi or siem devendra fadanvis lagaataar unke nishane par rahe
 Patola also participated in the farmers' agitation organized by former finance minister and senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha in Akola
 patole kaa koi sagaa nahinek varisht congress netaa ne kaha tha ki nanabhau patole kabhi kisi party ke vafaadaar nahin rahe
 The Congress leader had said that the farmers' issue is just a show off, Patole wants a ministerial post and was forced to leave the party if ignored by the BJP
 nagpur seat par hoga dilachasp muqablamaharashtra kii up rajdhani or vidarbha kaa sabase pramukh shahar nagpur vaise to rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa garh he, lekin yahaan sabase zyada chunaav congress ne jite hai
 Currently, BJP veteran and Union Minister Nitin Gadkari is the MP from here
 unhone 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main chaar baar ke saansad congress ke varisht netaa vilaas mutemvaar ko haraaya tha
 Looking at the political backdrop of Nagpur, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari from Nagpur and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis are two faces who dominate the BJP quite well

 On Saturday, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi started his election rally from Meerut
 raily main modi ne 'scam' (SCAM) ke sahare sapa, congress, akhilesh or mayawati par nishaanaa saadhaa
 In the speech, the main targets of Modi were Akhilesh and Samajwadi Party
 modi ne akhilesh sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki pichley paanch varshon main upi main kisaanon kii jameenon par avaidh kabje hue
 The entire state has lost its corruption
 lekin is chunaav main upi se mafiaraj ko hataane ke liye matdaan karnaa hoga
 This time you have to vote against corruption and mafiaraj in UP elections so that they do not come to power again
 modi ke akhilesh sarkaar par tikhaa hamalaa karne kii tamaam vajahen hai
 Today, we are giving you a few reasons for why Modi targeted the SP in western UP except RLD and BSP
 sapa se sidhi ladyeemodi chaahate hai ki pradesh kii janata ke bich yah sandesh jaae ki bijepi kii sidhi ladaai sattarudh samaajawaadee party se hi he
 bjp's strategy is to somehow show themselves in a better position than other parties
 todani he akhilesh kii chhavimodi ke bhaashan se saaf najar aata he ki pichley dinon akhilesh kii lokapriyata main badhottaree se bijepi pareshaan he
 He wants to portray Akhilesh as a villain somehow
 modi ne kanoon-vyavastha, bhrashtachar or garibi ke liye akhilesh ko hi doshi tehraaya
 Pangamodi dragged Mayawati in a 'scam' from the Jats who did not want to take in Western UP but kept silence on the RLD with a strong hold in Western UP
 darasal, bijepi chunaav purv jat voters ko chhedana nahin chaahati
 The Jats had voted for Modi in 2014 but they have been angry with the BJP for some time
 aise main jat netaa ko nishaanaa bana modi koi risk nahin lenaa chaahate
 Polarization will happen, BJP knows that if BJP wants to win UP elections, polarization of votes is very important
 yahi vajah he ki vah sapa se takkar leti najar aana chaahati he or duusari ore uske netaa hinduvadi bayaan dete najar aate hai
 Significantly, the Muslim vote, which has played a decisive role in UP since 1991, goes to the one who has the power to defeat the BJP
 aise main bijepi kii najar 'duusare dhruv' par he
 The possibility of a post-election alliance is discussed in the manner in which SP and Congress have formed a pre-election alliance
 usee tarah chunaav baad agar jarurat padi to bijepi ek baar phir bispi ke saath ja sakati he
 In such a situation, Modi has maintained the scope by not making a sharp attack on Mayawati
 america ne kaha he ki taliban ke nae netaa ke paas shanti chunane or afgaan niti shanti vaarta main shaamil hone ke liye baatcheet ke jariye samaadhaan talashne kii ore kaam karne kaa avasar he
 "we hope he will take advantage of this opportunity," Foreign Ministry Deputy Advocate Mark Toner said in his daily press conference on Wednesday
 mullah haibatulla akhundjada bane taliban ke nae netapakistan main shanivaar ko ek america drone hamale menmullah mansoorki maut ke baad taliban ne ek dharmik netamullah haibatullkhundjada ko apana nayaa netaa niyukt kiya he
 The Taliban have rejected the Afghan government's peace initiative
 toner ne ek prashn ke uttar main kaha, uske (haibatulla) ke paas shanti kaa chayan karne or vaarta ke jariye ek samaadhaan talashne kii disha main kaam karne kaa avasar he
 We expect that he will now make this selection
 unhone kaha ki akhundjada kaa naam aatankwaadiyon ke naam vaali kisi suchi main shaamil nahin he
 Toner did not answer questions about whether he was the target of US forces in Afghanistan
 unhone kaha, main is sambandh main pehle se kuch nahin bataaungaa ki america ke rashtriya suraksha hit main ham kise nishaanaa bana sakate hai

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene ke maamle main logon se jhooth bolaa he
 The people of Delhi will no longer tolerate injustice on this issue
 arvind kejariwal ne ravivaar ko kaha, ye jhootha bahaanaa he ki desh kii rajdhani hone kii vajah se dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa ye bahaanaa ab nahin chalegaa
 Because the people of Delhi are ready to give control of the entire NDMC area to the central government, but the rest of Delhi where there is an elected government cannot be left under the central government
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki narendra modi sarkaar dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar ko gaiyr-nyyochit tareeke se hastkshep kiye bina kaam karne de or dilli sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main adnga lagaana band kar de
 All possible options were tried for this but no success was found in it
 kejariwal ne kaha ki purna rajya ke liye 1 march se anischitkaaleen upwas par baithne ke alaava koi rasta nahin bachaa he
 Kejriwal said that in the last four years, the Modi government passed orders and snatched away the powers of the Delhi government
 dilli ke logon ke saath centre sarkaar kaa yah dhokhaa ab janata kii adaalat main he jo loktantr kii sabase badi adaalat he
 Chief Minister Kejriwal said, CCTV, school, hospital, Mohalla clinic etc
 were obstructed in every work of Delhiites
 hamane har koshish kii or inke saamne gidgidaae, dharna kiya
 He also went to court, but there is no way left, he is fasting
 kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli ko purna rajya dene ke mudde par bijepi ke rukh kaa pardaafash ho gaya he, kyonki usne dilli ko purna rajya dene ke apane dashakon puraane vaade se palati maar lee he
 He also said that the bjp's current opposition to giving full statehood to Delhi is clear that during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi ji lied to the people of Delhi
 dilli kii janata unke is jhooth kaa jawaab degi
 Reminding the BJP of its promise on the matter of granting full statehood status to Delhi, Kejriwal said that the then Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister LK Advani in the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee government to give full statehood status to Delhi in the Lok Sabha
 Brought the bill desh ke grih mantri ke taur par adwani ji ne agast 2003 main dilli ko purna rajya dene vaala bill loksabhaa main pesh kiya tha
 The Parliamentary Committee on Home Affairs, led by veteran Congress leader Pranab da, supported the bill in December 2003, but the bill was ultimately not allowed to proceed
 kya ye sirf dilli ke logon kii bhaawanaaon se khilne ke liye kiya gaya? dilli ke logon ke saath ye anyaay kyon?advaniji, as Home Minister, in August 2003 introduced statehood for Delhi Bill in Lok Sabha

 Therefore, the Center should keep the entire NDMC area under its control, but how can the rest of Delhi, which has a government of its own, be kept completely under the central government

 Yes, Delhi is India's national capital, so let the center keep entire NDMC area under its complete control
 How can rest of Delhi, in which Delhiites elect their own govt, be kept subservient to the Centre? No more injustice to be tolerated

 However, the US tried not to give too much importance to the capabilities of Al Qaeda
 america ke sheersh aatankwaad virdohi visheshgy samajhe jane vaale siie ke purv visheshgy bruce redelle ne pitiai se kaha, is saal (al kaayda netaa ayman al) jawahiri kaa yah pehla video he or ise bahut gambhirtha se lenaa chahie
 Al Qaeda wants to portray Prime Minister Modi as an enemy of Islam
 redelle ne kaha, pakistan main iskaa aadhaar or lashkar-e taiyaba ke saath iskaa kareebi gathjod hone kii vajah se al kaayda bharat ke liye khatra he
 He said this when he was asked about the latest video of Jawahiri, in which he applied Sharia from Afghanistan to Myanmar to start a jihad in Kashmir, Gujarat and Assam in India and to achieve the goal of establishing a Khilafat
 Has announced to open a new branch in the Indian subcontinent
 redelle ne yah doharaaya ki bharat kii nai sarkaar ko is dhamkee ko bahut gambhirtha se lenaa chahie
 He said that New Delhi should increase counter-terrorism cooperation with the US and Afghanistan
 mumbai main 2008 main hue aatanki hamale ke baad bharat or america ke bich aatankwaad virdohi sahyog khaasaa badha he
 However, the US has yet to verify the credentials of creating a video or new branch, Al Qaeda

 Naturally, we are seeking that if there is more information about this, then we should get it
 unhone kaha ki ham is ghoshnaa ko al kaayda kii nai kshamtaaon ke sanket ke taur par nahin dekh rahe hai
 He reiterated that the United States is committed to destroying al Qaeda, as it is a threat to America wherever it is
 yah bhi sunishchit karnaa he ki al kaayda america ke khilaaf apni kshamta behaal nahin kar sake
 Many anti-terror experts, such as Riedel, do not agree with the US State Department's stand
 unka kahana he ki yah al kaayda kii ore se nayaa khatra he
 Taufil Ahmed of the 'jihad and Terrorism Threat Monitor' of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) says, i think, Al Jawahiri's announcement to set up an Al Qaeda branch for South Asia is disturbing, because it 11 September is a few days before the anniversary of the attack
 raashtra kii suraksha ke liye sarhad par har vakt tainaat rahane vaale jaanbaaj javaanon ne deshavaasiyon se shaheedon kii yaad main deep jalaane ko kaha he
 Border Security Force (BSF) personnel have called upon all countrymen to light a lamp or candle in memory of the martyred soldiers while fighting with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir on Diwali, making their family members proud
 in jaanbaaj javaanon kii sarhad par mustaidi kii badaulat ham desh ke andar aman chaiyn se diwali or anya tyohaar manaate hai
 They protect the country by betting on their lives

 Ashok Kumar Sahu, a BSF jawan from Bihar, says that he regrets staying away from his family on the festival of Diwali, but the country's security is paramount
 desh kii suraksha ke baad parivaar aata he
 Apart from this, BSF jawan Arun Kumar Singh says that it is our first task to keep patrolling and alertness on the border and the festival comes later
 is baar punjab se sate international border par jawan diwali manaa rahe hai
 However, the family is also not present with him on this occasion

 Pakistan is continuously violating ceasefire and targeting Indian posts
 haalanki bharat kii ore se bhi pakistani sena ko karaara jawaab diya ja rahaa he

 Aparna Yadav, the younger daughter-in-law of Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav, seems more secure in living her political future with Akhilesh Yadav than Shivpal Yadav
 yahi vajah he ki vah chachaa shivpal ke saath khulkar jane se kataraane lagi hai
 If sources are to be believed, Aparna has once again started working on improving her relationship with SP President Akhilesh Yadav
 sutron kii maane to aparnaa yadav kii najar uttar pradesh kii sanbhal loksabhaa seat par he
 Sambhal parliamentary seat is considered the traditional seat of SP and Mulayam family
 mulaayam singh yadav or ramgopal yadav sanbhal se saansad rah chuke hai
 Presently, the SP is in control of three assembly seats falling under the Lok Sabha parliamentary seat
 mulaayam kii raajnneetik viraasat ke rup main aparnaa yadav sanbhal seat par apni daavedaari kar rahi hai
 But even if the SP does not give her a ticket on this seat, she can still remain as a star campaigner for the party
 bataa den ki pichley dinon lakhanu ke jila karyaalay main aparnaa yadav ke samarthakon ne sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav kaa bada swaagat kaarykram kiya tha
 Not only this, Aparna Yadav's supporters in the areas around Lucknow are constantly seen in the meetings of Akhilesh Yadav
 soobe main sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke baad aparnaa ke karibiyon ke mutabik samajawadi party zyada majboot hui he or shivpal yadav bahut badi chunauti nahin ban paa rahe hai
 This was the reason that Aparna once again reiterated that she would stay where Netaji would live, meaning that she would not leave the Samajwadi Party
 haal hi main ajtak se khaas baatcheet main aparnaa yadav ne kaha tha ki akhilesh yadav or mayawati kii sanyukt press conference se pradesh main acha sandesh gaya he
 Both are in a very strong position on the ground from the SP-BSP alliance
 haalanki aparnaa yadav aakhri baar shivpal yadav kii lakhanu raily main dikhi thim, jisame mulaayam singh yadav bhi maujuud the
 Since then, Aparna has almost kept away from Shivpal Yadav's party
 wo kisi bhi kaarykram main shaamil nahin hui hai
 While Aparna Yadav has received an offer to choose any parliamentary seat in the state from Shivpal Yadav's party Progressive Samajwadi Party
 aparnaa apana siyaasi kadam phoonk-phoonk kar rakh rahi he, yahi vajah he ki unhone abhi tak pragatisheel samaajawaadee party kii taraf se chunaav ladane kii hami nahin bhar rahi he
 However, according to Aparna close, she will not contest the Lucknow seat again

 Taiwanese tech company Asus recently launched its premium segment smartphone Asus 6Z in India
 company ne Zenfone kii branding hataa lee he, isliye ye ab Asus 6Z he
 This smartphone was in the discussion in Indian users due to different selfie cameras
 Asus 6Z main flip camera modul diya gaya he jo vaaki shandaar he
 It also has many different uses, but the smartphone is not good or bad just because of the selfie camera
 Asus 6Z ke do verients hai – 6GB / 64GB or 8GB / 128GB
 Talking about the price, you will get the initial variant for Rs 31,999, while the 128GB variant has been priced at Rs 34,999
 is premium smartphone main Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset diya gaya he, flip dual camera he or 5,000mah kii bydaree di gai he
 Design and build quality Asus 6Z i have used for a few days
 premium lagata he
 The design is good, the build quality is also not lacking
 is phone kii banaavat isaki keemat ko justiphi karti he
 That is, if you are buying a smartphone worth more than 30 thousand rupees, then obviously you will expect a premium phone and this phone lives up to it
 phone ke rier panel par Gorilla Glass diya gaya he jo karvd he
 It does not slip with the hands to hold the phone
 phone ke front main aapako puri screen dikhegi, haalanki chin aa notice karenge
 The placement of the flip camera is done on the rear panel itself
 flip camere kii placement main thodi si dikkat he
 Dust fills easily in this
 flip camera baahar aata he dust is place par aasaani se jagah bana leti he
 The same flip camera has dual LED flash and laser autofocus sensor which is in between the two camera sensors
 ye facial ricognishan ke liye bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 On the rear panel is the Blue Asus logo with fingerprint scanner
 company under disple fingerprint bhi de sakati thi
 Overall the design and build quality is good and is premium
 displexasus 6Z main 6
 a 4-inch display is provided
 ye phul echdi plus he jiskaa rijolushan (1080X2340) he
 HDR 10 has been supported in the display
 disple vaaki khubasurat he, koi bhi noch yaa katout nahin diya gaya he
 All screen smartphone
 bottm main bejal hai, lekin chaaron taraf bejal kaaphi kam hai
 The viewing angle is good, the screen is bright, colorful and sharp
 disple main koi aisi kami hamen mahasoos nahin hui he jisaki vajah se ye kaha ja sake kii isaki disple aivarej he
 Camera: i think the Asus 6Z camera can be used in many ways
 agar aap photography pasand karte hai to vaaki ise aap pasand karenge, lekin quality or behatar kii ja sakati he
 The company has done well with the flip camera and you can control the flip camera movement which is a good thing
 camera spekes kii baat karen to Asus 6Z ke flip camera modul main do camere hai
 One has Sony's 48 megapixel lens i
e
 Sony IMX586
 ye sensor aaj kal kaaphi popular he
 The second camera is 13 megapixels and here you get a 125 degree field of view
 camera modul ko control kar sakate hanise segment kaa best selfi camera kah sakate hai
 Because you can use the rear camera as a selfie camera
 selfi camera interphes open karte hi camera peeche apni jagah se nikal kar upar aa jaataa he or aap selfi clic kar sakate hai
 There is also an option to control this flip camera in the camera interface, which is quite interesting
 is flip camere ko aap apane man mutabik move kara sakate hai
 You can also decide the speed
 automatic pano shots vaaki shandaar hai
 You can click the photo of any angle (limited angle)
 krantikari banane ke liye company is phone main agar 360 degree camera detii to baat alag thi
 Now let's talk about camera quality
 photose acchhee aati hai, lekin wide angel lens utan prabhavit nahin karata he
 The pictures clicked in portrait mode are good and it detects the background better and keeps it apart
 Asus 6Z main optical image stebligeshan yani OIS nahin diya gaya he or isaki kami jarur khalati he
 Photography is good in daylight or low light, there is detailing in photos, there is no problem or problem
 kam raushnee main photose clic karne ke liye super nite mod kaa opshan diya gaya he
 This makes the photos clear, but you cannot expect details from the image
 video kii baat karen to isse aap 4K recording kar sakate hai
 But it is limited to only 10 minutes
 haalanki 60 frames prati seconds se karenge to aapako 5 minute hi milenge
 You cannot switch the camera during the video i
e
 from normal lens to wide angle lens
 Asus 6Z kaa camera kaa flip camera modul or camera quality ko acha kaha ja saktaa he
 At least, like other companies, there is no pop up selfie camera which is only for one purpose and that is to avoid the notch
 vaise bhi chote noch se koi khaas fark nahin hota
 Asus 6Z Thumps Up for New Camera Experiment
 lekin ise or behatar kiya janaa chahie
 Especially the dust problem
 parformansthasus 6Z main Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 diya gaya he jo abhi company kaa flagship procesar he
 There are two memory variants that we mentioned above
 yah smartphone Android 9 par chalata he
 Its battery is 5,000mah
 connactivity ke liye USB Type c diya gaya he
 Fast charging is also supported
 headphone jaik he, micro esady card kaa saport he or behtareen sterio spikars die gaye hai
 i have written about the performance of many smartphones so far, including the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855
 ye bhi parformens ke maamle main vaisaa koi krantikari phone nahin he
 There is no problem in ordinary use, the phone runs smooth, does not lag, does not hang and is fast
 isamen diya gaya AI Boost Mode yuj karke ise or bhi fast kar sakate hai
 This phone is good for gaming
 pabaji jaise game phul settings par achche se chalate hai
 Multi tasking is not a problem
 ap lod hone main samay nahin lagaate hai
 The user interface is also fine
 disple badi or shandaar hone kii vajah se videos dekhne yaa gaming main meraa experience acha rahaa he
 The sound of this phone is impressive

 spikars par company ne badhiya kaam kiya he
 Battery backup? One thing is clear that companies have probably stopped working on Battery Tech now
 chaahe 5,000mah kii bydaree ho yaa 3,000mah kii, byaap ke naam par kuch khaas nahin miltaa he
 Companies should work on battery tech and bring smartphones with batteries that actually give two to three days of battery life
 ajkal smartphone kii batariyaan jitani teji se charge hoti hai vaise hi teji se dren bhi hoti hai
 However, we talk about the battery backup of Asus 6Z

 The phone is fast charged

 Read, Aaj Tak Sports Editor Vikrant Gupta's conversation, in which Shoaib will also be seen using his 'sense of Humor'
 itane vakt tak cricket khelnakis tarah mushkil hota he?vakaar:vaaki
 Playing with so much fitness
 maine unke saath hi shuru kiya test khelnaa
 It has been ten years since i retired
 ab to camentry se ritair hone kaa vakt ho gaya
 But they are still playing
 unka dedication kamaal he
 He also used to take his bat to the hotel
 usne cricket ko puja, jaise log use yahaan puujate hai
 Perhaps this is the reason
 shoeb akhtar:allaah ne unako bahut gun die
 Remember, he is not just a good batsman, but also a human being
 izzat bhi di he or unhone control bhi rakhaa
 He did not become crazy even after being famous
 unako itnaa paisa diya, kaash mujhe uskaa aadha de de
 i want to take the phantom
 2007 main unke saath vakt bitaayaa
 Used to eat food together
 ham lakhanu main sahaara shri kii party main gaye the
 After that we went for a walk
 main, sachin, sahvaag
 Prince
 mujhe masti suujhi
 i said to Sachin that i should pick you up? He said that he did not curry
 par maine uthaa liya or vah slip ho gaye
 i picked them up and hugged them
 kaha tuje kuch ho gaya, to india mujhe jinda jala degaa
 He started laughing
 badi quality di hai bande main allaah ne
 Waqar bowled Sachin at the speed of 150 in his first Test
 aapane sochaa nahin ki ye bachche ko kyon phenk rahaa hum?vakaar: mujhe garv he ki maine test cricket kii shuruyaat sachin tendulkar ke saath kii
 It was very special
 hamen lag rahaa tha ki ye kya majaak kar rahe hai
 Even his beard and mustache did not come
 mujhe yaad he us daure ke kuch pehle jadeja or mongia vagairah under 19 team main aae the
 They were talking about Sachin
 magar jab hamane sachin ko dekha, to laga, kahaan se le aae is bachche ko
 When Sachin got the ball, brother Ajit said, i heard him in the crowd
 vakaar: lagi thi, bahut zyada tej nahin lagi thi
 Made as much
 khun aa rahaa tha
 But he did not fall down
 uskaa helmet bina gril tha
 shook her head
 do teen minute rukaa or phir khilne laga
 Shoaib: And sledding was going on during that time
 pakistan or bharat ke match ke dauraan khaas taur par
 The umpire gets stuck in the middle
 use donon taraf se padati he
 Waqar: Our team was good during that time
 javed miyandad, saleem malik or imran khan the
 In the new one, i and Wasim Akram were there
 aise main hari pichon par hamaara saamana karnaa mushkil tha
 But Sachin played very well
 imran khan ne kaha tha ki injamaam sachin se behatar khelte hai fast bowler ko
 What do you have to say? Waqar: He is at the top of the cricket world
 uske aankade hi bataa dete hai
 Not just home, he scored on every kind of pitch
 us westeindies jisase log darate the
 Go there and kill
 shoeb akhtar:mujhe apana bhi idia nahin tha
 Sachin did not even have much idea
 mujhe nahin pataa tha ki tisare test main khilne kaa mauka bhi milegaa
 i always followed Waqar Bhai
 hamaare pakistan cricket main inspireshan or talent khatm ho gaya
 No money
 controvarsi bahut he
 i found out in the last that Vicky is not playing brother
 maine tab tak shoej bhi nahin pahan rakhe the
 Later it felt like it was made for cricket
 phir sledging band ho gai
 Always felt proud that i am playing with it
 koshish kar rahaa tha ki zyada pitayee na ho
 And felt very honored when he took his wicket
 hameshaa lagata tha ki us cricketer kaa wicket mila, jisane is khel kaa tarika or itihaas badal diya
 Let me clear two or three things
 maine ye kabhi nahin kaha ki wo darate the mujhase
 i said that his elbow was bad
 vah hook or pul nahin kar sakate the
 i exploded that thing
 maine kaha sachin comfortable nahin the
 But later Haua stood up
 maine akasar kaha he ki sachin akele kitna karen
 When he got help, the team's results began to show
 abhi ipel kaa match khel rahaa tha bombai main
 Crowd there too
 main shahrukh ko bolaa ki agar maine sachin ko out kiya to ye chodenge nahin
 He said do not stand on the boundary
 aisa hi kiya
 Sachin also said later, yer tune out again
 
 
 
 
 vakaar ke time india zyaadaatar harata tha
 Started beating Shoaib's time
 kya sachin isaki sabase badi vajah the?vakaar:bada galat hoga, sirf sachin ko credit dena
 The team was developing
 pakistan ke khilaaf hameshaa under pressure kheli
 There used to be matches in Sharjah
 hamaari bowling linep acchhee thi
 Sourav Ganguly should get credit
 jaisaa usne team ko develop kiya
 Sachin is Sachin
 usko to har cheez kaa credit dena hoga
 Not just a test
 vanade or twanti twanti
 Apart from Sachin
 rahul dravid or lakshmana
 Ajay Jadeja too
 bahut spark lekar aayaa
 Just as Dhoni, Raina, Virat came, they brought spark
 us jamaane main change ho rahaa tha
 Then they started winning and we started losing
 akhtar:sachin ne har ira main ran kiye
 What does the world say in atties, in nineties? ninties main mujhe lagata he ki duniya kii sabase mushkil bowling thi
 Wasim, Waqar Bhai, mcgrath, Warne, Saqlain Mushtaq, Walsh, Ambrose
 bahut tagdi fast bowling thi
 i think it was the most difficult to run in that IRA
 sachin ne ran banaae tab
 Then the bouncers could also do the whole 6 of 6
 ball bhi reverse hota tha
 So who scored 85 to 2000 in Ira
 vah kamaal kaa he or unhone aisa duniya ke har bowler ke khilaaf, har jagah ran kiye
 She told her class
 vakaar aap 2004 main team main nahin the
 There is talk of Peshawar Airport
 pakistani team pehle se khadi hui thi
 Shahid Afridi was standing
 vah sachin se bole-paaji aap aage aa jaao, yuvaraj bole, mere liye bhi kar do kabhi
 Shahid said, if you become half like Sachin, then i will make the entire airport empty
 dressing room main kitna respect tha?vakaar:usne neet clin cricket kheli
 His name did not figure in the controversy
 jentalman game khelaa he
 See how he meets juniors
 24 saal khele hai, lagbhag dhai dashak
 He has seen four generations of cricket
 kuch jo saamne ritair hue
 Some that started in front
 aapako junior most cricketer bhi bataa degaa, usko bhi najar aata he ki vah kaisaa khelaa he
 Everyone responds in the dressing room
 mujhe nahin lagata ki ab koi or aisa khel paaegaa
 When there was a meeting in the Pakistani dressing room, how much was there on Sachin? Akhtar: The focus was on the meeting
 kai baar sochate ki kit bag hi uthaa len uskaa
 But he always carried a bag
 sicurity bhi thi
 i didn't even have a friend so much that someone would talk hamen pataa tha ki sachin ke out hote hi india team neeche lag jaati thi
 But when he used to play, Allah has given so much ability that he used to play in a smooth manner
 ham meeting main out swing par baat karte the
 His bat would come out many times
 to yahi tha ki out swing daalo
 But his chance seemed to be a bye
 sahvaag us vakt leethal khel rahaa tha
 sehwag-sachin's opening stand was bloodthirsty
 ek se jaan chhudaao to doosraa peeche pad jaataa tha
 The batting line became very strong after Dravid's arrival
 main usase kahata tha ki yaar tu baahar baari le liya kar
 You spit a lot
 aapako yaad he 2003 main centurian kaa match tha
 Sachin did not eat anything during the lunch break
 bas icecream khai or us jamaane main 270 ran chej kar daale
 What did you expect? Waqar: We were comfortable
 us vakt shoeb or wasim acchhee bowling kar rahe the
 We thought that the early wickets were taken and Shoaib bowled the early over instead of me
 kabhi nahin sochaa ki wo aisa plan karenge
 Don't know if the plan was Heat of the Moment
 pataa nahin chalaa kya hua
 Sehwag is seen playing like this
 magar sachin ko aise maarthe nahin dekha
 Sachin takes time
 ining bild karte hai
 But he came and went very far in the first four-five overs
 jab tak hamane out bhi kiye chaar-paanch
 Was very late
 shuru main donon ne atake kiya
 When Sehwag was out, Sachin became the second player
 akhtar:us raat ke pehle meraa ghutana suja tha
 Three injections without telling the captain
 inako pataa he ki ghutana 95 se hi tutaa he
 The doctor was saying play five tests
 aid vagairah karke, paisa banaakar nikal jaao
 But i kept playing on the basis of mental ability
 sachin jab us din centurian main aayaa to focusd dikh rahaa tha
 The bowling i was trying to do was not happening
 wo ball roak nahin rahaa tha, panch kar rahaa tha
 The wicket was also good
 phir laga ki cat par ball karun, shaayad body par aae
 But the direction was falling
 unhone itane jor se shot maari ki point par chakka aayaa
 i have been thinking for many years that India is so happy with my eating a six, so do not eat it everyday
 sachin ne us din ameging batting kii
 i said Vicky brother Ball did not fall
 vah phir khud ball karne aa gaye or sahvaag ko out kiya
 But where he bowled Sachin, he used to kill him
 baaki hamaari fielding mashallah aapako pataa hi he
 Fellowes stand like terminators
 mere saath rajjak khadaa tha
 It was our lado
 kuch baat karo to naaraaz ho jayega
 Straight Stiff was standing
 maine kaha hill to le
 It was Sachin's day, he killed us
 idhar bhi
 There too
 jab itnaa player on da role ho to aap kuch nahin kar sakate
 Waqar: Apart from this big match, i think there was a big inning for Chennai Test 99
 vah bahut special thi
 He had a problem in his back
 wicket squaire ho rahaa tha
 Saqlain and Afridi were bowling brilliantly
 magar ye sher kaa baccha akelaa khadaa rahaa
 But our jack got hooked
 wicket kitna mushkil tha ki uske out hone ke teen over ke bheetar hi hamane nipta diya
 
 
 You bowled to Lara, Potting, Sachin and Waugh
 sachin inke saamne kahaan thaharte hai?vakaar:sabaki apni quality he
 It would be unfair to choose one
 par main agar captain hum or ek ko chunanaa he to sachin ko hi chununga
 Sachin always scores big after clicking
 fifty tu handred badalanaa ameging he
 Akhtar: One thing was common
 ham donon ke bat kaa wet ek tha
 Stance was also a match
 maine sachin se kaha ki yaar fark sirf 13-14 hajaar ran kaa he
 Talent is our only one
 (tahaakaa)iff ballebaajon main fark karnaa bada julm he yaar
 Leave any one
 sachin aise maaregaa
 Inzamam will die like this
 bryan lara itane style se maaregaa
 Sachin's class is just right up there
 agar koi use number van batsman kahana chaahe, to dout nahin hona chahie
 Some innings that are famous
 uske alaava old traverd main sau kiya, team neeche lagi hui thi
 Did it sparingly
 mjedaar baat thi, choti pul bhi maari
 Took a lot too
 puraa match hi akelaa le gaye
 When cricket was in peak, in the era of waqar-wasim, india-pakistan Test cricket did not happen
 das saal cricket na hona akharata he?vakaar: regreat unako bhi hai or hamen bhi
 Such a big cricket could not happen
 unhone bhi ise miss kiya
 It remained in his career
 utane ran nahin kiye, jitne kar saktaa tha
 We also felt that could out
 cricket ke baad life kisi ho sakati he?itane achche insaan ko india jaaya nahin karegaa
 His presence is very important
 dressing room main
 So that the children cannot slip out
 viraat acha ja rahaa he
 Rohit Sharma India's biggest batsman is coming after Sachin
 un sabake liye gol set karnaa behad jaruri he
 Sachin should forget his past completely and start fresh
 magar india unhen bhuulane nahin degaa
 Wherever we go, people will say, you did it, you did it
 har cricketer ke saath ye hota he
 When he leaves, he does not understand for two years
 karnaa kya he
 Wake up in the morning, sitting on the couch, wearing thick socks
 sardi badi lagati he
 Do not understand what to do
 lost ho jate hai
 i hope he gets busy again soon
 bisisiai ke saath milakar kaam karen
 The whole of India is open
 isisi kaam le saktaa he
 Do not allow rust
 conference se sawalpahala sawaal sachin ke bhai ajit tendulkar ne poocha:zikr syalkot ke debyue match kaa ho rahaa he
 When Sachin got Waqar's bouncer and started bleeding
 hamen vakaar kaa ekson or bowling bahut pasand thi
 How loud it was now, only Sachin could say
 akhtar: aap aij e bhai kah rahe hai, meraa bhai dekhtaa to tivi se baahar nikal aata
 Gulshan Grover asked the second question: i am a big fan of cricket
 sachin kaa bhi or aapkaa bhi
 My question is related to your last answer, two or three days ago when i came for dinner, i met Dravid and asked
 ye cricket main ritairement he, ye samaj nahin ai
 When so much is associated with the game, the talent, the experience, then says right away that retirement
 kyon aisa he ki tallent ko team se hatane ke baad bhi istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa mukammal dhang se
 See why i can't revive a career's second inning or retirement
 pehle hero boodha hokar ghar baith jaataa tha
 But look at Amitabh Bachchan
 vakaar:har cheez kaa and to hota he
 You play cricket, do TV
 role badalte jate hai
 Comes as a hero, becomes a father or a chacha
 cricket main bhi aisa he
 You cannot play international cricket after one level
 kuch vakt tak waiteran cricket chalaa
 But then there was no room for him either
 itnaa cricket ho rahaa he
 
 bisisiai kuch karegi is bare main
 Like Sunil Gavaskar is doing
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ab ye dikhaane main jute gaye hai ki asli baas koun he
 After removing two cabinet ministers from his cabinet on Monday, on Tuesday, on the day of Bakrid, he also discharged Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary Deepak Singhal
 hameshaa vivaadon main rahane vaale IAS officer deepak singhl ko do maheene pehle hi chif secretary banaaya gaya tha
 It is well known that Akhilesh Yadav did not like Singhal and was against making him the Chief Secretary
 lekin mulaayam singh yadav ke dabaav main unhen deepak singhl ko mukhya sachiv bananaa padaa tha
 Rahul Bhatnagar has been made the Chief Secretary, Finance Department Rahul Prasad Bhatnagar has been made the new Chief Secretary
 rahul bhatnagar 1983 batch ke iees officer hai or ganna ayukta samet tamaam mahatvapurn padon par kaam kar chuke hai
 He is said to have a good rapport with Akhilesh Yadav
 deepak singhl ko philhal pratiksha suchi main rakhaa gaya he
 After becoming Chief Secretary, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was not happy with the manner of Deepak Singhal
 kai saarvajanik samaaroh main deepak singhl manch se jis beandaaj tareeke se bolte the vah lagaataar akhilesh yadav ko khatak rahaa tha
 When asked to talk to Akhilesh on the stage - listen to me later, listen to me first
 In a ceremony of distributing Kanya Vidyadhan last month, people were stunned when Deepak Singhal asked Mike on the stage to talk to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav later , Listen to them carefully first
 mukhyamantri us samay manch par maujuud apane salaahkaar alok ranjan se kuch mashwara kar rahe the
 Deepak Singhal also intervened with Alok Ranjan, who was the chief secretary before him and asked the advisor to advise later
 ek anya samaaroh main deepak singhl ne yah kah diya tha ki mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav dil or dimag donon se bachche hai
 After becoming the Chief Secretary, the Chief Minister was the chief minister of Singhal's treatment; Deepak Singhal was constantly receiving complaints about the way he was treating and threatening other officials
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki uttar pradesh main khanan ko lekar hoicourt ne jis tarah sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh de diya or sarkaar uski court main thik se pairvi nahin kar saki
 The Chief Minister was angry with that too
 amar singh kii party main janaa padaa bharisutron ke mutabik asli kaaran bana ravivaar ko dilli main amar singh kii party main deepak singhl kaa shaamil hona
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav did not go to this party
 kuch samay pehle amar singh ne akhilesh yadav ke khilaaf kai baaten kahi thim
 Despite this, the Chief Minister may not have liked his Chief Secretary going to Amar Singh's party
 shivpal ke khaas maane jate hai singhmpani sarkaar kii image sudhaarney main lage akhilesh yadav ne somvaar ko hi apane do cabinet mantriyongayatri prajapati or raaj kishor sinhako barkhaast kar diya tha kyonki unke upar bhrashtachar ke aarope the 
 Deepak Singhal had made several rounds in the court of Mulayam Singh and Shivpal Yadav to become the Chief Secretary
 deepak singhl ko shivpal yadav kaa khaas mana jaataa he
 Akhilesh Yadav's tussle with Shivpal Yadav over the Communist unity party is already going on
 aise main bakreed ke din shivpal yadav ke kareebi officer kii qurbaani samaajawaadee party or upi sarkaar main kya gul khilaati he is par sabaki najar hogi
 The BJP Media Cell on Sunday organized a workshop for spokespersons from all the national and state parties and TV panelists going to television debates
 isamen bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne centre sarkaar kii teen saal kii uplabdhiyon ko aakraamak tareeke se janata ke bich le jane ko kaha
 Also, BJP President Shahne gave tips to make the government's works and schemes better accessible to the public
 shah nesaaf shabdon main kaha ki modi sarkaar janata ke liye jitne achche kaam kar rahi he, unako janata ko aasaan tareeke se samajhane kii sabase jimmedaari party pravaktaaon kii he
 Shah gave an example of some schemes of the Modi government and directed all the spokespersons to make people aware of the benefits of GST
 unhone pravaktaaon se kaha ki chaahe ujjwala yojana ho yaa jan dhan yojana yaa phir svachh bharat abhiyaan sabhi ke prachaar-prasar kii jammedaari sarkaar se saath aapaki bhi he
 The BJP president said that by taking concrete steps to fill the pit on the development and economic front during the Congress government, the Modi government has not only filled it, but is also building the tower of development there
 piyush goyal ne bhi kaaryshaala main desh main bijli ke kshetra main aae sudhaar par pregentation diya
 During this, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that before going into any kind of TV debate, whatever the issue is, the matters related to it should be researched
 tazaa maamle kii jaankaree se hameshaa apdet rahanaa chahie
 The incident in Hyderabad has shaken the entire nation
 is ghatana ke baad se hi ek baar phir desh main mahila suraksha par sawaal uthne shuru ho gaye hai
 Not only this, there is a lot of anger about this issue across the country
 log jagah-jagah aropiyon kii sajaa ke liye andolan kar rahe hai
 Recently, Bollywood actor Farhan Akhtar has also tweeted about women's safety
 is twit main unhone bataaya ki agar rajnatik partiyaan mahilaon kii suraksha sunishchit kar sakati hai to unhen chunaavahraana kaaphi mushkil hoga
 This tweet by Farhan Akhtar is drawing a lot of attention on social media
 saath hi log is par jamkar apana riection bhi de rahe hai
 i think that any political party that can ensure the safety of women (not just pay lip service) will be hard to defeat electorally
 For one, they'll surely have half the electorate supporting them
 Second, if their concern is genuine, their inherent values can't be wrong
 farhaan akhtar (farhan Akhtar) ne apane twit main mahilaon kii suraksha or rajnatik partiyon ko isse jodate hue likhaa, "meraa maananaa he koi bhi rajnatik dal jo mahilaon kii suraksha ko sunishchit kartaahe (keval shabdon se hi nahin) use chunavi taur par haraa paanaa mushkil hoga

 On December 10, the Supreme Court cleared the amendments made to the Panchayati Raj Act of the Haryana government, while Justice Abhay Manohar Sapre, who was on the two-judge bench, had a different view, while associating himself with the verdict
 panchayat chunaav ladgaye ke liye ghar main shauchalay hone kii anivaary shart ko samvidhan kaa ulanghan nahin maanate hue justise sapre kii tippanee he, “vakt kaa takaza he ki janhit main ise ek rajya main simit karne kii bajaae sunishchit karnaa chahie ki yah puure desh main lagu ho
 This decision of the Supreme Court came after a challenge given by the Haryana government to the amendments brought in the Panchayati Raj Act
 panchayat chunaav ko lekar gatirodh khatm hone ke hafte bhar ke bheetar hi haryana sarkaar ne chunaav kii nai tarikhon kaa elaan kar diya he
 That is, five new conditions will be applicable for contesting panchayat elections & 10 years or more in any crime, a defaulter has been declared by taking loan from co-operative institution, bank etc
 and cannot contest elections if the electricity bill is outstanding
 jabaki shaikshanik yogyata kii sharton main saamaanya shrenee ke logon kaa 10 veen paas hona, mahilaon ke liye 8veen paas, essi varg ke liye 8veen paas, panch ke liye essi mahilaon kaa paanchavin paas or sabase ahm, ummidavaar ke ghar main chaalu shauchalay hone kii anivaary shart jod di gai he
 For this, the Haryana government first amended the Panchayati Raj Act 1994 through an ordinance in August, which was stayed by the High Court on 19 August
 iske baad rajya kii manohar laal khatter sarkaar ne adhyadesh ko waapas lete hue 7 sitambar ko vidhansabha se panchayat raaj sanshodhan vidheyak 2015 paas kara liya or agle din hi panchayat chunaav kaa elaan kar diya gaya
 But citing the commencement of the electoral process, the High Court refused to intervene, following which a petition was filed in the Supreme Court on 14 September by Rajbala, Kamlesh and Preet Singh and on 17 September, the Court stayed these amendments
 
 iske baad khatter sarkaar ne court main apana paksh rakhane ko vakt maanga or 22 sitambar ko panchayat chunaav par roak lag gai
 After two months of debate, the Supreme Court, while delivering its verdict on 10 December, upheld the five amendments of the Haryana government
 lekin is faisle par jis tarah se kanoonee or rajnatik bahes shuru ho chuki he, uskaa asar aane vaale samay main dikh saktaa he
 The most important question is arising that when there is no such restriction on the law-makers for the country and the state, then why the sarpanch
 court main chunauti dene waalon ne bhi apni daleel main kaha tha ki isse haryana kii 64 fisadi gramin aabaadi adaalat se maharoom ho jaaegi
 Instead of directly commenting on the decision to contest the election, counsel for the petitioners Vikram Mittal told India Today, "the court may have justified the amendments in its decision, but there is no discussion of fixing the accountability of the state government on education whereas More than 50 percent of the villages in Haryana do not even have a school up to tenth standard
 ” faisle ko trutipurna maanate hue yachikakarta adaalat main punarvichaar yachika daakhil karne kii ranneeti bana rahe hai
 In the Supreme Court, lawyer Indira Jaising calls it a deep blow to healthy Indian democracy
 chunaav ladgaye ke liye shauchalay kii anivaaryta par unhone kaha, “aisa lagata he ki svachh bharat abhiyaan kaa jo sandesh desh main pahunchaa he, vah adaalat kegehan main itani gaharaai tak paith gaya he ki adaalat khud isaki vishesh brands ambesder ban gai
 ”virag Gupta, another advocate of the Supreme Court, sees this decision as a constitutional crisis
 ve kehete hai, “sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon kii rajyon ke str par manamaani vyakhya se desh main na sirf sanghavaad varan kanoon ke shashan ko bhi khatra he
 The introduction of such laws to legislators-mps will only solve the issues of governance and democracy will be healthy
 ” unka kahana he ki jaise purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii “garibi hataao” muhim kii vifaltaa ke baad “garib hataao” muhim shuru ho gai thi, usee tarah “sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas” ke naare par satta main ai bijepi svachh bharat abhiyaan ko safal nahin bana paa rahi to is tarah ke jabariyaa kanoon thopane lagi he
 Not only the legal debate about this decision, political debate is also at its peak
 haryana vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa abhaya singh chautaala kehete hai, “jab desh main koi anpadh raashtrapati, pradhanmantri, mukhyamantri, mantri ban saktaa he to sarpanch kyon nahin? bijepi ko is faisle kaa khamiyaja bhugatna padegaa
 If he feels that this decision has been taken in public interest, then the party should contest the panchayat elections on its election symbol, the reality will be known
 ”lekin haryana bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv dow
 Says Anil Jain, "the Supreme Court is the largest institution to interpret the Constitution and we should follow its sentiments
 vaise bhi jab is tarah ke chunaav sudhaar kii pahal hoti he to sawaal uthte hai, par baad main sabhi uskaa khayr makadam karte hai
 "but why not this condition on the MP-MLA contesting elections?" Jain says, "the debate has just started
 ham nahin kehete ki aisa saansadon-vidhayakon ke liye nahin hona chahie
 But there is also the fact that the sarpanch signs the check, not the MP-MLA
 isliye chunaav sudhaar kii pahal panchayat str se hoti he to achche badlaav laae ja sakate hai
 "they say that now Haryana, Rajasthan have implemented it, other BJP ruled states can also adopt it
" lekin congress netaa or purv kendriya panchayat raaj mantri manishankar ayyar saarvajanik taur se is faisle ko nyaay ko jhatka qaraar dete hue sansad ke dakhal dene kii maang kar chuke hai
 She argues, “the Haryana government's decision is anti-women, OBC, SC-ST
 ” aane vaale samay main bihar main panchayat chunaav hone hai, lekin vahaan sattadhari party jedy (you) ke mahasachiv ke
 C
 tyaagi ise samvidhan kii mul bhaavana ke khilaaf qaraar dete hai
 He says, "this is a wrong decision, excesses with the village and weaker sections
 desh main nirakshartaa he yaa shauchalay nahin bane hai to iske liye sarkaar doshi he
 The Haryana government wants to deprive the village people of their fundamental rights
 gaanv main panchayat nyaay karti he or bahut saare masale samuhikta ke aadhaar par hal hote hai, jiske liye shaikshanik yogyata kii jarurat nahin he
 He also asks the Supreme Court to declare the matter raised in Parliament, "constitution is not made for the elite", the court should reconsider the decision and while giving decision in such cases, it should also express the feelings of the Constitution Should be kept in mind
 ”vaise is faisle par chhide kanoonee-rajnatik mahabharat main bijepi samaajawaadee party ke tewaron se thodaa sukun mahasoos kar sakati he
 sp's national general secretary Naresh Aggarwal says, "if the Supreme Court has said it, then consider it
" upi main panchayat chunaav ho chuke hai
 The next time the elections are held, the government should consider it because illiterate people find it difficult to work
 ”supreme court ke faisle ke baad chunaav or raajnneeti ke apradheekaran ko khatm karne kii bahes phir shuru hogi or ise panchayat tak simit karne kii bajaae sansad tak lagu karne kii maang uthegi
 In such a situation, this issue can become a headache for the BJP in the coming times

 In the joy of completing 50 years in politics and 78 years of life, on 23 June, when Virbhadra Singh took out a gleaming sword from the sheath, this political Surma, who had been the Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh five times, probably felt something
 aane vaale dinon main unke saamne jo paristhitiyaan aane vaali hai, unase nibatane ke liye unhen apane shastraagaar main har tarah ke hathiyaar rakhane kii jarurat padegi
 Trouble came barely after 48 hours after thousands of enthusiastic supporters gathered at Shimla's skating rink proclaiming him their Messiah
 shimla kii vishesh adaalat ne virbhadra singh or unki patni pratibha par bhrashtachar or aapraadhik shadyantr ke aarope tay kar die
 a day later, on 26 June, he resigned from the Union Cabinet
 unhone kaha, ''main apni party or pradhanmantri ko sharminda nahin karnaa chahta hum
 "and thus he clearly placed himself morally higher than those who were forced to withdraw from his earlier UPA government
" unhone jor dekar kaha ki yah ''mere rajnatik virodhiyon, prem kumaar dhumal ke netritv vaali bijepi sarkaar or himachal police dwaara rachi gai sajeesh he
 "but in a conversation with India Today, Chief Minister Dhumal says," The CD was revealed in May 2007 by Vijay Mankotia, an ally of the Virbhadra cabinet
 sidi unke hi iees adhikari ne banavaai
 cds are not used for electoral use, so they brought a stay from the High Court
 visilence kii jaanch kaa bhi unhone aadesh diya
 He went to the High Court 4-5 times to get the FIR canceled
 forensik jaanch main virbhadra or unki patni kii aawaaj sahi pai gai
 In such a situation, where did the BJP come from

 The Congress is on the back foot due to the allegations of corruption on the main claimant of the Chief Minister's post before the assembly elections due this year
 pradesh congress ke prabharee mahasachiv choudhary birendra singh kehete hai, ''agar hamaare ek netaa par charge lag gaya to kya ham yah kahana chhod den ki bijepi kii sarkaar bhrasht nahin he
 "state Congress President Kaul Singh Thakur, who is considered to be anti-virbhadra, gives a concise and concise response," The matter is in court
 virbhadra apni kanoonee ladir ladenge or paak saaf niklenge
 The government has acted in retaliation
 '' congress is puure maamle main sahanubhuti batorne kii ranneeti bana rahi he, jise dekhte hue bijepi ne pehle din dikhaae aakraamak tewaron kii dhar kund kar lee he
 He also feels that if the party adopts this issue aggressively, then the elderly leader will get sympathy
 dhumal kehete hai, ''maamla court main he or vah sangyaan legi
 But in the election we will definitely make the Congress national level corruption an issue
 ''bijepi yah maanakar chal rahi he ki jis tarah hycourt se lekar nichali adaalaton tak virbhadra ko lagaataar jhtke mili hai, party ko alag se abhiyaan chalaane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 The June 25 indictment of Virbhadra is based on revelations made by the state's Vigilance Bureau in 2009 over a controversial audio cassette investigation, which was recorded in the last round of his second term as chief minister in 1989
 jaanch karne waalon kaa kahana he ki tepe main sunai dene vaali aawaaj virbhadra singh or unki patni pratibha kii he jo mohinder paal (1989 main rajya ke udyog nideshak) se avaidh dhan ke len-dein ke bare main baat kar rahe hai
 The recording was made public on May 27, 2007 by 71-year-old Major Vijay Singh Mankotia, a political opponent of Virbhadra Singh and former Congress minister, after which the then Dhumal government on 3 August 2009 filed an FIR against the Virbhadra Singh couple

 cheema ke mutabik, ''chandigarh kii siefel ne audio casette kii aawaaj ko 'sambhawatah' shabd kaa istemaal kar pramanit kiya he

 dakshin dilli ke farmahouse se jab pehali baar ponti or hardip chaddha ke maare jane kii khabar baahar ai to kissa saaf tha ki donon bhaaiyon ne jameen vivaad main ek-duusare ko goli maar di
 But as the investigation progressed, this story of death got entangled
 shaq kii sabase badi vajah to yah rahi ki ponti ne mahaj teen ungaliyon se tabadatod goliyaan kaise chalaai hongi
 The second question arose from the fact in the post-mortem report that Ponty was shot from a distance while Hardeep was shot from close range
 yani do aadmi ek-duusare ko goli maar rahe hai to goliyaan baraabar duuri se kyon nahin chalin
 The biggest question raised on the murder case is the presence of Sukhdev Singh Namdhari
 namdhari ponti ke kareebi maane jate hai or unka lanbaa aapraadhik record he
 He was the chairman of the Uttarakhand Minorities Commission till the time of the murder
 baad main unhen pad se hataa diya gaya
 The report was written by Namdhari on behalf of Ponty in this murder case, but Delhi Police also took him under the purview of his interrogation
 bich main khabar ai kii namdhari police se bachate phir rahe hai, lekin teen din kii chuppi ke baad namdhari ne kaha ki ve kahin nahin bhaage hai or police kii jaanch main sahyog dene ko raji hai
 In fact, when Ponty Chadha reached the farmhouse on the day of the incident, he was accompanied by a security guard of Namdhari and Namdhari
 ponti ke paas apana suraksha guard nahin tha, jabaki ve hameshaa apane nijee suraksha amale ke saath chalaa karte the
 a report written by Namdhari to the police said that his security guards opened fire in Ponty's defense
 lekin jab donon taraf se guard goli chalaa rahe the, to maut sirf donon bhaaiyon kii hi kyon hui?hatyakand main tabadatod golibari or goli chalaane ke aarope main paanch logon kii giraftaar baar-baar sawaal uthaa rahi he ki hatyakand ke peeche koi teesraa aadmi to nahin he
 Especially when it is speculated that Ponty was being used to whiten the black money of many politicians
 udhar donon bhaaiyon kii hatya ke baad jis tarah chaddha parivaar ne ekajutata dikhaai he or jhagade ke bare main koi tippanee nahin kii he, aise main puure maamle kaa ulajhna lajimi he
 Perhaps that's why the Delhi Police has so far questioned over 100 people in connection with the massacre
 police jaanch ke mutabik, is hatyakand main hardip ke 0
 3 Smith & Wesson pistols were used
 iske alaava namdhari ke suraksha guard ke paas eseef karbaine thi
 The security personnel provided by the Punjab Police to the Chadha brothers had four carbines and three AK 47 rifles and a 9mm pistol
 police in saare hathiyaaron ko foracinc jaanch ke liye bhej rahi he taaki yah pataa chal sake ki kis hathiyaar se goliyaan daagi gayi
 Such a huge arsenal of weapons, the quarrel of the immense wealth of the Chadha brothers and the changing appearance of politics is making the massacre like detective stories
 hatyakand kaa raaj khulne par pataa chalegaa ki is khooni khel main chaddha bandhu mohara the yaa khilaadi

 In astrology, three zodiac signs are considered to be the zodiac signs of the fire element
 ye rashiyaan hai - mesh singh or dhanu
 There is a significant amount of energy and fire inside these zodiac signs
 in raashiyon ke liye surya sabase mahatvapurn hota he
 These zodiac signs are considered courage and leadership

 parshadon kii apaat baithak bulaai gai or is baithak main parshadon ko unka tikat kaate jane kaa farmaan suna diya gaya
 For the councilors present in the meeting, this announcement was exactly the same as PM Narendra Modi did for demonetisation
 kaha bhi yahi gaya ki maujuuda parshadon kaa tikat kaatane kaa achaanak faisla karke dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne nagar nigam chunaav main notebandi formula hi istemaal kiya he
 After this decision, people are now also taking a pinch that the condition of the present BJP councilors has become exactly the same as the thousand and five hundred currency notes after the Kinotbandi
 kyonki nagar nigam main kai parshad aise hai, jo na sirf anbhavi hai, balki unke paas apana janaadhar bhi he
 But after the party's decision, his experience and support base was of no use
 unhen tikat milane kii gunjaaish party ne hi khatm kar di
 In such a situation, like the notes of five hundred and thousand, their inquiry will remain in the party before the elections, but they will not be able to contest the elections
 kai parshad todas or pandrah saal se dilli nagar nigamamen chune hue sadsy hai, aise main achaanak aae party ke faisle ne na sirf aane vaale chunaav kii taiyaariyon par pani pher diya he, balki tikat pakkaa maanakar chal rahe kai diggajon ke armaanon par bhi pani pher diya he
 The BJP currently has 155 councilors in all three mcds, out of which no one will get tickets as per the party's decision, so the possibility of infighting within the party in the coming days cannot be ruled out

 aarope he ki digdarshan institute ke jariye saal 2014 main 514 chaatro ko naksali bataakar farji tareeke se sarender karaayaa gaya tha
 Police and administration officials were also involved in the entire episode

 Despite the fact that police officers were involved in the case, the investigation remained confined to the name of the job
 un par aarope he ki jaanch ke naam par khel hua or adhikariyon ko bachaa liya gaya
 In this case, the report of the National Human Rights Commission was also ignored which said that the senior police officers misused the surrender policy to increase the surrender figure
 sarender karne vaale yuvakon main se mahaj 128 se hi police ne bayaan liya
 The police could not even verify the addresses of most of them or they could not be found at these addresses

 Later all the youth were kept in the old jail

 Surprisingly, after the surrender no youth was presented in the court
 maanavadhikaar ayog ne bhi is prakaar yuvakon ko rakhane ke liye police adhikariyon ko doshi bataaya tha
 Although the police may have closed the file, but the matter is still pending in the High Court

 Ghulam Nabi Azad said that on the one hand BJP is going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji's birth, but at the same time no action is being taken against the person who publicly praised Bapu's killer
 ye kaise sambhav he, or koi ise koi kaise dephend kar saktaa he
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said, "this year we are celebrating Bapu's 150th birthday, it is a matter of pride
 
 
 saath hi saath mujhe afsos hota he ki jis saal ham baapu kii 150veen jayanti manaa rahe hai usee saal sattadhari party se kuch aise saansad chunakar aa rahe hai, jo gandhi ke hatyaron kii saraahna kar rahe hai
 
 
 a candidate said that the person who killed Bapu was a patriot
 
 
 us shabd ko doharaate hue meri jubaan jal jaaegi
 The BJP candidate would say that the patriot who killed Gandhi was
 
 
 meri pradhanmantri narendra modi se shikaayat he ki aapako usee vakt party se use dismis kar dena chahie tha
 
 
 And should have said that this is not our candidate

 rajyasabha main aaazaad ne sunai nehru kii kahaneiske baad gulam nabi aaazaad ne pandit jawahar laal nehru se judi ek kahani sunai
 Azad said that in 1952 Nehru reached out to campaign for a candidate in the assembly
 nehru jab kaarykram sthal pahunche to vahaan jila congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki yahaan se galat vyakti ko tikat mila he, is shaks par kuch aarope hai
 After this, Pandit Nehru said that whether there is any independent candidate from this constituency whose image has a clean leader, he was told that yes there is such a candidate
 iske baad nehru jab manch par bhaashan dene ke liye aae to unhone kaha ki ve aae to the congress candidet ke liye vot maangane, lekin unhen us ummidavaar ke bare main kuch aisi baaten pataa chali hai jo thik nahin hai
 So vote for this independent candidate
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki log nehru kii safagoi se itane prabhavit hue ki unhone us swatantra ummidavaar ko vot diya or wo jeet bhi gaya
 There was also hope from Nehru like PM, Nabi Azad said that he had similar hopes from Prime Minister Narendra
 unhone kaha ki gandhi ji congress ke adhyaksh to the, lekin saath hi ve rashtrapita bhi the
 There should be no action against a person who calls this Father of the Nation a patriot
 
 
 is par kya kaha ja saktaa he
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the BJP still has a chance to act on it before October 2, otherwise the stain will always be imposed on the ruling party

 Tej Pratap placed a condition in front of Sushil Modi that he should not want a cheating bride

 aap puch sakate hai tarakkee ke is loktantr main aapkaa hissaa kahaan he? Hariyali Teej 2018 mangalvaar ko tii-20 world cap main newzealand ke haathon bharat kii haar ho gai
 Can we call this the defeat of Mother India? What is the difference between India and Mother India? The government that rules this country is the Government of India or Mother India? When we get inside this question, then we find that a concept which is imposed on the country is actually making us something else
 ham apane bharat ko thos dhang se samajhane kii jagah, uski samasyaon or uske sankaton se jujhane kii jagah, bharat mata kii ek kaalpanik murti banaakar apni vifaltaaen chhipaane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Of course, in our imagination of India, there should be a Mother India
 desh sirf kagaz kaa naqsha nahin hota
 We have a passionate relationship with him
 kyonki agar bharat mata nahin hogi, to bharat ek shushk bhugol kaa naam hoga, hamaari nason main bajane vaale sangeet kaa nahin, hamaare honton par tirane vaali kavita kaa nahin, hamaari ragon main daudane vaale khun kaa nahin
 But it is important to understand that by taking the name of Mother India again and again, we neither increase the honor of Mother India nor the power of India
 yah thik vaisaa hi he, jaise ham vaqt kii pabandi yaa sachai yaa ahimsa ko lekar rose mahatma gandhi ke sujhaaye raste kii andekhi karte hai, or rose unhen baapu yaa raashtrapati bataate hai
 This does not increase the honor of Mahatma Gandhi, it is less
 bharat yaa bharat mata kii izzat kaa maamla bhi yahi he
 When we are a tolerant democracy, the country feels big
 jab ham ek kattar samaaj dikhte hai, to desh chota ho jaataa he
 Bharat Mata is ashamed when we shed riots, Bharat Mata's honor rises when we save lives in floods and tsunamis
 lekin yah moti or adarshavaadi samaj to hamamen se har kisi ke paas honi chahie
 Why wouldn't she be? Because whatever we name India and Mother India, we do not understand it properly
 ham sabake apane-apane bharat hai

 unhen lagata he ki vibhaajan kaa makasad do aise raashtra bananaa tha, jinamein se ek main hindu or duusare main musalmaan rahen, jabaki apni sari vidmbanaaon or vibhaajan kii pidaa ke bich bhartiya raashtra rajya kii manyata thi ki pakistan bhale dharm ke aadhaar par apana raashtra banaae, lekin bharat un tamaam logon kaa mulk bana rahegaa, jo dharm or jati ke kisi bhedbhaav ke bina ek saath rahane ke hami hai
 It was a test that was very difficult in the years following Partition - as the rivers of blood were flowing on both sides of the border - but Hindustan won this test - he proved his greatness
 lekin hindustan ke, bharat ke yaa bharat mata ke bahut saare imtihaan jaise ab bhi baaki hai
 The Constitution gave everyone political equality and a dream of social equality, but this equality remains a dream till now
 bahut saare duusare logon ko malaal he ki loktantr kii vajah se sabakaa vot baraabar hua or 'raja' or 'parja' ek ho gaye
 The Indian nation state is basically a system of forward forces
 saamaajik jivan main jati kii paith bani hui he or shaadi-byaah ab bhi mote taur par jatigat daayre main hote hai
 The social inequality, which has become more insignificant at the economic level
 bahut bada hindustan apane hukmaranon se niraash he
 Governments are changing, but it appears that there is no fundamental difference between Modi and Manmohan, Chidambaram and Jaitley at the level of economics
 saamaajik soch main jo fark he, vah bhi bas itnaa hi he ki congress jis sampradayik card ko chhipaakar khelti rahi, use bijepi khullamakhulla khelti he
 The comments baharhaal, mul bindu par lauten - bharat or bharat mata main kya antar he
 The mention of India creates a complex canvas, in which history also comes, geography and people also come and their crises
 ham is bharat main rahete hai - is bharat ke achche-bure sabake zimmedaar hai
 We sometimes raise the nose of this India, sometimes humiliate it
 is bharat ke bheetar kshetreey jhagade or asantosh hai - kashmir se lekar purvottar tak aise pradesh hai, jinhen is bharat se badi shikaayat he
 There may be legitimate and some illegitimate reasons for this complaint
 is bharat ke paas ek vishaal sena he, ek samprabhu sarkaar he, ek sarvocch sansad he or ve sari vyavasthaaen hai, jo ise majboot banaati hai
 It is, of course, a full-blown throbbing country - surrounded by its own crises, full of possibilities
 yah bharat ek yatharth he - bharat mata ek kalpana he
 But what is this fantasy? Unsurprisingly one can say that this is the fantasy of a perfect India - a country in which there are no diseases, mourning, sorrows, mourning and disputes
 aisi bharat mata ke liye har kisi ke munh se jai niklegi, kisi se jabaran nikalwane kii zarurat nahin padegi
 But it is important that we adapt this India to the ideals of Mother India
 yah tabhi sambhav hoga, jab ham dharmik vidwaeshon se upar uthenge, un asantoshon ko pachaane kii koshish karenge, jo bharat ke bheetar paidaa ho rahe hai
 The problem is that a large section of the name of Mother India is bent on taking the test of everyone
 vah bharat mata ko ek aise naare, ek aisi chadi main badalata he, jisase un logon kii pitayee ho sake, jo bhartiya raashtra rajya ke alag-alag tatwon ke kilaaf asantosh jataate hai
 Actually, to make India the replacement of Mother India is to become a son and try to take possession of the entire land, which is actually the right of many people
 agar kuch log yah mahasoos karte hai ki is bharat mata kii aad main asli bharat par kabza karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he, to unako virodh karne kaa haq he
 But when a elected public representative suspends the assembly of a state simply because it is not ready to speak Bharat Mata ki Jai and instead says Jai Hind, then it can be understood how big and dangerous this ghost of nationalism is Has gone jab ek naare ko deshprem kii iklauti kasuti bana diya jayega to bahut saare log badi aasaani se deshbhakti kaa praaanpatr baantne or hasil karne lagenge
 Then this patriotism will work to cover many of their crimes
 philhal yahi hota lag rahaa he
 This is weakening India and shaming Mother India
 beshak, bharat kii hamaari kalpana main ek bharat mata bhi honi chahie
 The country is not just a map of paper
 uske saath hamaara ek bhavuk rishta hota he
 Because if India is not a mother, then India will be the name of a dry geography, not of the music playing in our veins, not of the rhyme on our lips, not of the blood running in our veins
 lekin yah samajhnaa zaruri he ki bharat mata kaa baar-baar naam lekar ham na bharat mata kaa sammaan badhaate hai na bharat kii shakti
 This is the same as how we ignore Mahatma Gandhi's suggested way of punctuality or truth or non-violence, and daily call him Bapu or President
 isse mahatma gandhi kii izzat badhati nahin, kuch kam hi hoti he
 This is also the case of Bharat or Mother India
 jab ham ek sahishnu loktantr hote hai, to desh bada lagata he
 When we appear to be a staunch society, the country becomes smaller
 jab ham dangon main koon bahaate hai, to bharat mata sharminda hoti he, jab ham baadh or tsunami main logon kii jaan bachaate hai, to bharat mata kii izzat badhati he
 But this thick and idealistic understanding must be held by all of us
 vah hoti kyon nahin? kyonki ham bharat or bharat mata kaa naam jitna bhi len, ise thik se samajhate nahin
 We all have our own India
 bahut saare logon ko malaal he ki 1947 ke vibhaajan ke baad bharat ko hindu raashtra kyon nahin ghoshit kiya gaya
 They felt that the purpose of partition was to create two nations, one of which would be Hindu and the other one to be Muslim, while in the midst of all the irony and agony of partition, the Indian state of the nation believed that Pakistan should make its nation based on good religion
 , But India will remain the country of all those who agree to live together without any discrimination of religion and caste
 yah vah imtihaan tha, jo vibhaajan ke baad ke varshon main bahut kadaa tha - kyonki sarhad ke donon taraf koon kii nadiyaan bah rahi thim - lekin hindustan yah imtihaan jitkar niklaa - usne apana badppan sabit kiya
 But there are still many examinations of India, India or Mother India
 samvidhan ne sabko raajnneetik barabari di or saamaajik barabari kaa sapana diya, lekin yah barabari ab tak sapana bani hui he
 Many other people are sorry that due to democracy, everyone got equal vote and 'raja' and 'parja' became one
 bhartiya raashtra rajya multah agadon kaa tantra he
 Caste remains in the social life and marriages are still largely within the caste hierarchy
 jo saamaajik gairbarabari he, vah aarthik str par or zyaada alanghy hoti gai he
 Very large India is disappointed with its ruling
 sarkarein badal rahi hai, lekin yah nazar aata he ki modi or manmohan main, chidambaram or jetali main arthniti ke str par koi buniyadi fark nahin he
 The difference in social thinking is also that the communal card that the Congress kept playing in secret, the BJP plays it openly
 tippaniyan Nonetheless, return to the original point - what is the difference between Bharat and Bharat Mata
 bharat kaa zikr ek jatil canvas banaata he, jisamen itihaas bhi chalaa aata he, bhugol bhi, log bhi aa jate hai or unke sankat bhi
 We live in this India - the good and the bad of this India are responsible for everyone
 ham kabhi is bharat kii naak oonchi karte hai, kabhi ise apamaanit karte hai
 There are regional quarrels and discontent within this India - from Kashmir to the Northeast, there are regions which have a big complaint with this India
 is shikaayat kii kuch jaays or kuch najayas vajahen bhi ho sakati hai
 This India has a huge army, a sovereign government, a supreme parliament and all the systems that make it strong
 zaahir he, yah ek puraa jeeta-jaagta dhadkta hua desh he - apane sankaton se ghira, apni sambhaavnaaon se bharaa-puraa
 This Bharat is a reality - Bharat Mata is a fantasy
 magar yah kisi kalpana he? behichak kah sakate hai ki yah ek adarsh bharat kii kalpana he - vaise desh kii, jisamen koi rog-shok, dukh-matam, jhagade-vivaad na hon
 For such Bharat Mata, Jai will come out of everyone's mouth, there will be no need to forcibly remove anyone
 lekin yah zaruri he ki is bharat ko ham bharat maa ke aadarshon ke anuroop dhaalein
 This will be possible only when we rise above religious xenophobia, trying to digest the discontents that are arising within India
 sankat yah he ki bharat mata kaa naam lene vaala ek bahut bada tabaka jaise har kisi kii pariksha lene par tula rahata he
 He transforms Bharat Mata into one such slogan, a stick that can beat those who express dissatisfaction against different elements of the Indian nation state
 darasal bharat ko bharat mata kaa sthanapann bananaa betaa banakar us puri zamin par kabza karne kii koshish karnaa he, jis par darasal bahut saare logon kaa haq he
 If some people feel that the real India is being tried under the garb of this Mother India, they have the right to protest
 lekin jab kisi chune hue janpratinidhi ko ek rajya kii vidhansabha sirf isliye nilambit kar detii he ki vah bharat mata kii jai bolne ko taiyaar nahin he or isaki jagah jai hind bol rahaa he to samajha ja saktaa he ki rashtrawaad kaa yah bhoot kitna bada or khataranaak ho chalaa he
 When a slogan will be made the only criterion of patriotism, many people will start distributing and acquiring certificates of patriotism very easily
 phir yah deshbhakti unke bahut saare gunahon par pardaa daalane kaa kaam karegi
 It seems to be happening right now
 isse bharat kamazor ho rahaa he or bharat mata sharmasaar
 But it is important to understand that by taking the name of Mother India again and again, we neither increase the honor of Mother India nor the power of India
 yah thik vaisaa hi he, jaise ham vaqt kii pabandi yaa sachai yaa ahimsa ko lekar rose mahatma gandhi ke sujhaaye raste kii andekhi karte hai, or rose unhen baapu yaa raashtrapati bataate hai
 This does not increase the honor of Mahatma Gandhi, it is less
 bharat yaa bharat mata kii izzat kaa maamla bhi yahi he
 When we are a tolerant democracy, the country feels big
 jab ham ek kattar samaaj dikhte hai, to desh chota ho jaataa he
 Bharat Mata is ashamed when we shed riots, Bharat Mata's honor rises when we save lives in floods and tsunamis
 lekin yah moti or adarshavaadi samaj to hamamen se har kisi ke paas honi chahie
 Why wouldn't she be? Because whatever we name India and Mother India, we do not understand it properly
 ham sabake apane-apane bharat hai
 Many people have wondered why India was not declared a Hindu nation after the partition of 1947
 unhen lagata he ki vibhaajan kaa makasad do aise raashtra bananaa tha, jinamein se ek main hindu or duusare main musalmaan rahen, jabaki apni sari vidmbanaaon or vibhaajan kii pidaa ke bich bhartiya raashtra rajya kii manyata thi ki pakistan bhale dharm ke aadhaar par apana raashtra banaae, lekin bharat un tamaam logon kaa mulk bana rahegaa, jo dharm or jati ke kisi bhedbhaav ke bina ek saath rahane ke hami hai
 It was a test that was very difficult in the years following Partition - as the rivers of blood were flowing on both sides of the border - but Hindustan won this test - he proved his greatness
 lekin hindustan ke, bharat ke yaa bharat mata ke bahut saare imtihaan jaise ab bhi baaki hai
 The Constitution gave everyone political equality and a dream of social equality, but this equality remains a dream till now
 bahut saare duusare logon ko malaal he ki loktantr kii vajah se sabakaa vot baraabar hua or 'raja' or 'parja' ek ho gaye
 The Indian nation state is basically a system of forward forces
 saamaajik jivan main jati kii paith bani hui he or shaadi-byaah ab bhi mote taur par jatigat daayre main hote hai
 The social inequality, which has become more insignificant at the economic level
 bahut bada hindustan apane hukmaranon se niraash he
 Governments are changing, but it appears that there is no fundamental difference between Modi and Manmohan, Chidambaram and Jaitley at the level of economics
 saamaajik soch main jo fark he, vah bhi bas itnaa hi he ki congress jis sampradayik card ko chhipaakar khelti rahi, use bijepi khullamakhulla khelti he
 The comments baharhaal, mul bindu par lauten - bharat or bharat mata main kya antar he
 The mention of India creates a complex canvas, in which history also comes, geography and people also come and their crises

 The problem is that a large section of the name of Mother India is bent on taking the test of everyone

 ’saal 1971 main mukti sangram ke dauraan atyaachaar karne kii vajah se ‘mirpur kaa kasaai’ kahalaane vaale abdul kaadir mullah ko supreme court dwaara uski punariksha yachika khaarij kiye jane ke baad guuruuvaar kii raat faansee de di gai
 Abdul Kader Mulla is the first politician to be hanged for war crimes
 saal 1971 main hue yuddh ke shaheedon kii yaad main yojit raily ko sambodhit karte hue hasina ne shuukravaar ko apni kattar virdohi party bangladesh nesanalist party (bnpi) kii pramukh khalida jiya par aarope lagaaya ki ve maanavtaa ke khilaaf aparaadh karne waalon ko bachaane ke liye jamaat kaa samarthan kar rahi hai
 He said, 'we showed a lot of patience but we will not tolerate anymore
 desh ke log jaanate hai ki kaise in atyaacharon kaa jawaab kaise dena he, ham (sarkaar) bhi yah jaanate hai ki inhen kaise jawaab dena he or kaise kaabo main karnaa he
 The Prime Minister's statement came in response to the Jamaat's announcement of a nationwide strike and protest on Saturday to protest Mulla's execution
 mullah ko faansee ke baad jagah-jagah hinsa shuru ho gai
 The execution of Mulla has been termed as 'political murder' by the Jamaat and has vowed to avenge it

 The most unexpected compliment i have received so far about the graphic comic of Savita Bhabhi is from a woman who thanked me for showing Savita who achieves orgasm in every episode
 uski is aabhaar jataane kii vajah ekadam saaf he or main is baat kii shart lagane ko taiyaar hum ki savita bhabhi padhgaye ke baad bahut se patiyon ne apni patniyon se mahilaon ke charam-sukh hasil karne ke bare main poocha hoga or yah bhi ki vahaan tak pahunchane ke liye ve unki kis tarah madad kar sakate hai
 Results from the India today-mdra 2013 sex survey show that about 80 percent of women "always" or "mostly" achieve orgasm
 is nattejey ke maddenjar main yah maananaa chaahunga ki mardon or auraton kii sex jaruraton ke bich kii khai ko paatane main savita bhabhi kii bhi ek choti-si bhoomika jarur rahi he
 Personally, i do not believe that after 2003 there has been so much change in the Indian woman
 haalanki, ab yah kisi mahila ke liye zyada sweekaarya ho gaya he ki apni sex jaruraton or aakankshaon ke bare main khulkar baat karebhartiya mahilaon ke samoohon kii shaam kii chaay partiyon kaa main koi bhed to nahin jaanata, lekin meraa yah maananaa he ki unamem sex or apni jeet ke bare main charchaa jarur hoti hogi or ab yah sirf yuva mardon kaa hi adhikaar kshetra nahin rahaa
 i always used to think that Savita Bhabhi would be more popular among women, simply because it takes the sexuality of women far beyond normalization and presents a powerful woman who is confident and wants to enjoy her sexuality to the fullest
 
 ek saal pehle hamane jab survey kiya to yah jaanakar koi achraj nahin hua ki hamaari 30 fisadi pathak mahilaayein hai
 However, i would like to admit that when we did Savitabhabhi
 com taiyaar kiya to hamaare sheersh agenda par ‘‘nari mukti’’ nahin tha-yah dhire-dhire ek aise graphic upanyaas main tabdeel hota gaya jisamen sex kii kaman mahila ke haathon main rahati he!jab hamen mahila pathakon ke feedback milane shuru hue, to yah abhas hua ki yah bhartiya mardon ko is bare main shikshit karne kaa adarsh manch ho saktaa he ki mahilaon kii bhi yon jaruratein hoti hai
 According to me, this change was also happening to a large extent because of the way India was opening its doors to the world's culture through the Internet
 ab na sirf mahilaayein sex or tarah-tarah ke prayog ke bare main zyada jaankaree hasil kar rahi hai, balki unke mard saathi bhi mahilaon ke yon ichchhaaon ko lekar behatar samaj or sweekaaryata rakhte hai
 Many critics say that Savita Bhabhi shows women as objects of consumption
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki sach kaaphi had tak iske ekadam ulataa he
 Through Savita Bhabhi, we are trying to show that sex is not something that only men want
 darasal, yah dotarafa maamla he-aurat bhi utana hi majaa chaahati he jitna ki mard
 If we are able to reach even 50 percent of our readers, then you will be able to see women in India more happy
 bhedie kii tarah chillane vaale har aalochak ke vipareet hamen 10 aise log mil jate hai, khaskar mahilaayein, jo mahilaon kii yon aazaadee kaa sandesh pesh karne ke liye savita bhabhi kii tarif karte hai
 In my opinion, the main reason for this sexual freedom is the re-creation of the balance of power in Indian men and women
 2013 kii mahila pehle kii apeksha zyada taqatvar or aaazaad he jo khud aage badhkar apni sexuelity ko zyada khulepan se dikhaati he
 With access to internet and other sources of information, we can expect that this trend will continue further and Indian women will gain more freedom in all aspects of life including sex
 ab vah bedroom main apni bhoomika khud tay kar rahi he, yaa sambhog ke liye jo bhi anya prayog vah karnaa chaahati he, kar rahi he

 One of the initial announcements made by Yogi Adityanath soon after assuming the chair of the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh was a major announcement of the government subsidy of Rs 50,000 on the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra of Hindus
 se badhaakar ek lakh ru
 Doing hindu samudaay ne sabsidi ko ek jatke main doguna kiye jane kaa swaagat to kiya hi, saath hi bahut se logon ne isaki tulana muslim samudaay ko haj yatra par di jane vaali sarkari sabsidi se bhi kii
 But the interesting thing is that after increasing the subsidy on Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, the Muslim community has intensified the demand to end it instead of increasing the Haj subsidy
 muslim samudaay kaa maananaa he ki sabsidi ke naam par unke saath na sirf fareb kiya jaataa he, balki aisa karne se duusare samudaay ke logon main naahak yah sandesh jaataa he ki sarkaar musalamaanon kaa tushtikaran kar rahi he
 Salamat Ullah, former chairman of the Central Haj Committee, says in a terse tone, "this subsidy is nothing, just understand that the money goes from the account of the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of External Affairs and from there to Air India
" haji ke haath main to ek pai nahin aati
 "he says that it is mandatory for Hajis traveling through the Haj Committee to either travel by Air India or travel to Saudi Arabia's state-run Saudi airline
 unhone kaha, ''haj ke dauraan ye airlines hajiyon ke liye kiraaya doguna kar detii hai, jabaki isi dauraan duusare yatriyon se saamaanya kiraaya liya jaataa he
 That is, the government is giving subsidy not to Haj pilgrims, but to Air India
 "haj sabsidi ke ganit par jaaen to 2008 main yah 827 karod ru
 Had reached
 uske baad sarkaar ne ise kam karne kaa faisla kiya
 Later in 2012, the Supreme Court said that the subsidy should be completely abolished in the next 10 years
 is baat kaa samarthan karte hue islamic maamalon ke jaankaar jafarul islam kehete hai, ''2022 tak intjaar karne kii kya jarurat he, is sabsidi ko tatkaal band kar diya jaae
 "he believes that by ending subsidies, the Central Haj Committee should draw international tenders for the Haj pilgrimage and the companies who are willing to take the Hajis at the lowest fares should be entrusted with this task
 bharat se is saal 1
 70 lakh people will go on Haj pilgrimage
 inamen se kareeb sava lakh haj cameti ke jariye or baaki nijee operataron ke jariye jaaenge
 M
, the director of a travel agency in Delhi, providing packages for Haj pilgrimage
 tarik kehete hai, ''jab kisi airlines ko ek saath itane bade group ko yatra par le jane kaa mauka milegaa to jaahir he, vah kiraaya kam karegi
 In any case, giving subsidy on Haj is not right according to Islam
 karj yaa daan lekar haj yatra karnaa kisi musalmaan ke liye sahi nahin he
 Hajj done with subsidy is of no use
 "haj sabsidi ke duusare upyog kii ore ishaara karte hue salaamat ullah kehete hai, ''haj cameti ke takreeban 500 karmchaariyon ke vetan ke liye centre sarkaar alag se to koi paisa detii nahin he
 This money also comes from the money received from the Hajis
 behatar hoga ki sarkaar sabsidi band kar de taaki logon ko pataa chale ki sabsidi vaaki milti bhi thi yaa nahin
 "after this aggressive opinion on the Haj subsidy of Muslim organizations, Yogi Adityanath should also try to find out whether the subsidy that he has increased on the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra will really get the pilgrims or roam the government treasury like Haj subsidy
 The tax will remain
