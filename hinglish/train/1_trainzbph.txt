 I'm still wondering WHO said WHAT n to WHOM n who's asking me to find out WHAT happened WHERE — sonu sood (@sonusood) April 17, 2017 If you are also confused in these two Sanu of Bollywood, then let us know that Sonu Nigam is a well known singer of Bollywood who has playback playback in many films like 'kal Ho Na Ho', 'sathiya', 'border', 'dil Se' 
 vah haal hi main singing rielity sho 'indian ydal' main bhi jaj banakar najar aae the
 Sonu Sood is an actor who has appeared in Salman Khan's Dabangg and Shah Rukh Khan's Happy New Year
 i am still wondering WHO said WHAT n to WHOM n WHO'S asking me to find out WHAT happened WHERE a lot was at stake on Vikram, but on September 7, the country's lunar lander sat on the surface of the moon and sat up, as if everything was washed away in a mysterious way
 us par compact rover pragyan tha, jiske pahiyon par desh kaa rashtriya pratik ankit tha, jise chandramaa par bharat kii upasthiti kii ek sthaayee pahchaan darj karaani thi
 If the lander, named after Vikram Sarabhai, the father of the country's space program, would have been successful, the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) would have been better
 isse duniya main yah sandesh bhi gaya hota ki bharat ab antariksh anusandhan ke yug main he or america, tatkaaleen soviet sangh or china ke baad chandramaa par aasaan landing karne vaala chauthaa desh ban gaya he
 Incidentally, a hundred days of the second term of the Narendra Modi government were also being completed
 kisi or se adhik, isro ke chairman kailasavadivu sivan yah bakhubi samajhate the ki rashtriya aakankshaon ke saath is vishesh antariksh kaarykram ko jodgaye main kis str kaa jokhim chupa hua he
 He told India Today, "in rocket science, there is always a lot of unknown
 '' (dekhen baatcheet)
 Out of 109 lunar missions since 1958, only 61, or a little more than half, have been successful
 chandrayan-2 kii tarah 46 mishnon kii soft landing kii yojana banaai gai thi lekin unamem se keval 21, yani aadhe se thode kam, safal rahe the
 ISRO succeeded in its first attempt to send an orbiter, Chandrayaan-1, to orbit the Moon in 2008 and also gathered important information regarding the crashing of instruments on the lunar surface
 isse pehle ki vah tuutakar girtaa, usne chandramaa par pani ke anuon kii maujuudagi ke bare main mahatvapurn jaankariyaan bhej deen
 After this, ISRO surprised the world by sending Mangalyaan to orbit Mars in its first attempt in 2014
 mangalayan 24 sitambar ko is laal grah kii kaksha main paanch saal puraa karegaa or data waapas bhejnaa jari rakhega
 But despite all these successes, the soft-landing of a rover on the moon to gather critical information about the lunar surface requires complex technology to cope with the many new challenges that ISRO had to master
 
 isliye deshbhar main chandramaa par landing ko lekar bani uttejnaa ko dekhte hue antariksh kaaryakramon ke anbhavi sivan ne bhavishyavaanee kar di thi ki antariksh vaigyanikon ke liye vikram kaa chandramaa kii kaksha se uske sataha par utarane kaa charan '15 minute kaa aatank' bhi ho saktaa he
 Unfortunately for Sivan and ISRO, their fears turned out to be true
 bangaluru sthit mishan oparations complex main ise dekhne ke liye pradhanmantri ke upasthit hone ke saath, ve 15 minute niraashaa or vishaad main samaapt ho gaye
 Space scientists lost contact with Vikram in the 12th minute when it was just 2 from the lunar surface
 1 kimi upar mahatvapurn yuktipurna task puraa kar rahaa tha or iske baad kya hua, iskaa kuch pataa nahin he
 Although ISRO announced on 10 September that Chandrayaan-2 orbiter has discovered and photographed Vikram on the lunar surface, he is not too excited about it
 chandramaa kii sataha par vikram kaa pataa laga liye jane ke bare main puche jane par, sivan ne india today se kaha, ''iskaa koi khaas matlab nahin he
 We have not been able to establish any kind of communication with it and until we can do so, it has no meaning
 '' isse bhi mahatvapurn, sivan ne yah kaha ki vaigyanik abhi bhi vivaranon kaa vishleshan kar rahe hai or abhi tak koi jawaab nahin he ki lander ke saath aakhir kya gadabadi hui
 So, why did Joe Vikram behave in such a bizarre manner in the final three minutes of the final stages of landing, which ended the mission? An official failure-analysis committee is investigating the cause, India Today spoke to several space scientists and experts and tried to understand what might have gone wrong with this iconic lander in India
 utaar-chadhaav vaali shuruyatyahan vikram ke itihaas ke bare main thodi jaankaree se yah samajhane main madad mil sakati he ki kyon chandramaa par kisi lander ko utaarna jatil kaary he or kyon is tarah ke har do mishan main se ek asafalataa ke saath samaapt hota he
 India did not initially plan to attempt a soft landing on the lunar surface on its own
 swadesh nirmit chandrayan-1 orbitor ke launch hone se pehle hi, isro ne faisla kiya tha ki vah chandrayan-2 mishan ko safal banane ke liye rus kii fedral spes agency (roscosmos) kii madad or anubhav kaa upyog kar saktaa he or november 2007 main iske liye ek qaraar par hastakshar bhi kiye gaye
 Under this indo-russian joint lunar mission agreement, isro's main responsibility was to create an orbiter, while Lander and Rover were to make Russia
 2012 main prakshepan kii yojana banaai gai thi
 Although ISRO was ready with the orbiter on time, Roscosmos pulled out of the agreement in December 2011
 roscosmos ne aisa chini antariksh agency ke sahyog se mangal grah ke ek chandramaa par apana lander or rover utaarne ke phobose-grant mishan ke vifal ho jane ke kaaran kiya tha
 ISRO then decided that it would build the lander and rover itself and land it on the moon by 2016
 is bich, sanghathan ne mangalayan ke liye orbitor ko phir taiyaar kiya, ise record samay main puraa kiya
 Despite isro's enormous experience in building launchers and satellites, ISRO soon realized that designing and developing a lander and rover was a very complex task
 isro ke you
 R
 raav satellite centre ke purv nideshak or pichley saal tak grahon ke mishan ke prabharee em
 According to Annadurai, "it is one thing to send an orbiter to the moon, as we sent Chandrayaan-1 for an important research on the moon or an orbiter on Mars
 lekin parikrama karne vaale antariksh yaan ko neeche laana or use dhire-dhire chandramaa kii sataha par surakshit utaar dena kahin adhik jatil or chunauteepurn he
 "ISRO needs to master both of these technologies, to create flexible propulsion mechanisms that control the lander's landing process and to guide the spacecraft to land at a predetermined location on the lunar surface
 ye donon praudyogikiyaan pichley paanch varshon main viksit kii gai hai or vikram mishan ke samaypurv samaapti ke baad in donon praudyogikiyon kii hi safalataa par sabase zyada andeh he
 Landing plans After separating from the orbiter Chandrayaan-2 on September 4, Vikram revolves at an altitude of 30 km above the lunar surface at a speed of 1,680 meters per second (or 6,048 kmph, six times the speed of a commercial jet) Had been
 13 minute ke bheetar us veg ko, niyantrit charan main kam karte hue neeche laayaa janaa tha, jo sataha par pahunchate samay lagbhag shunya ho jaataa
 The lander would do this with the help of five rocket engines and eight small control thrusters fitted to its base and developed by ISRO specifically for this mission
 injanon ko throttle-sakasham ingine ke rup main dizin kiya gaya tha, jiske dabaav ko usamen pravaahit hone vaale eendhan ke pravaah ko rokkar niyantrit kiya jaataa he, bilkul vaise hi jaisaa car main lage exicrator se gati ko niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 Given the complexities of landing on the moon, a control and guidance system was also developed
 prithvi or chandramaa ke bich kii duuri 3
 Being 84 million km, it takes a little more than a second to send any instructions from the mission's control room on Earth, and it takes another second to send the data back to it by command of the vehicle
 vikram ke chandramaa kii sataha par teji se utarane ke dauraan nirnay miliseconds ke antaraal main lene padate, isliye isro ne autonomas maargdarshan or niyantran pranali viksit kii thi, jo 15 minute kii udaan ke dauraan sabhi sambhavit sthitiyon or visangatiyon kaa dhyaan rakhe
 In view of the lunar surface, the vehicle was equipped with highly accurate measuring instruments to monitor its velocity, altitude, posture, direction and position, enabling Vikram's onboard computer to make real-time decisions
 yaan ke niyantran or pranodan pranali kii dizin main bhi yah dhyaan rakhaa gaya tha ki chandramaa kaa gurutvkarshan prithvi kaa chatha bhaag he
 Both of these systems were tested by preparing conditions corresponding to the moon's irregular gravity
 bada parivartando saal pehle hi taiyaar sataha par utaarne kii isro kii nai yojana par bhi nigahen jami thim
 While designing the lander, ISRO scientists initially decided to work with only four engines instead of five
 is kanfigration main, ingine or gidence control system (niyantran pranali) ko dhire-dhire gati or oonchai ko ghataate hue chandramaa kii sataha se lagbhag 10 meter upar lekar aana tha
 But then there was a concern that being so short of the lunar surface could cause engine thrusters to blow up a huge dusty dust on the moon which would cover the vehicle and damage its vital equipment
 iske baad isro ne sabhi chaar injanon ko band karne kii yojana banaai or iske bajaae yaan ke chaar pairon ko majboot karne par jor diya taaki us oonchai se vah khud gire or lander yaa rover ko koi nuksaan bhi na ho
 This launch was scheduled in January 2018
 is bich, ek lander ko chaar injanon se niyantrit karte hue chandramaa kii sataha par utaarne ke sambhavit khataron par antariksh vaigyanikon ke bich joardaar bahes chhid gai
 ISRO decided to stop its free fall by placing a fifth engine in the center of the base of the lander
 isse do phaayde hote
 The fifth engine started only when all four other engines were stopped at a distance of 10 meters and the lander was ensured to touch the surface at very limited speeds
 or yah ingine yaan ke centre main sthit tha, isliye is ingine ke kaaran jo dhul udati, use vah dur dhakel detaa
 Apparently, the decision to install another engine would have added more weight to the spacecraft
 uske vinyas main anya parivartanon ke saath, orbitor, lander or rover ke saath chandrayan-2 kaa kul vajan ab 3
 Would have been 8 tons
 iskaa matlab yah tha ki jeeyosincronas satellite launch vehical, yaa jieselvi mark II ab launch vaahan ke rup main upyukt nahin tha, kyonki yah keval 2-3 ton kaa pelod le jane main sakasham tha
 So the Chandrayaan-2 project team would have to wait until isro's heaviest rocket GSLV Mark III, whose work was in progress, was fully ready for launch and obtaining permission
 pareekshan udaanon kii puri shrunkhlaa ke liye pratiksha karne ke bajaae, isro ne jieselvi mark xxrep 4 i kii pehali parichaalan udaan main hi chandrayan-2 ko bhejne kaa jokhim lene kaa faisla kiya
 And after the initial scare, GSLV Mark xxrep 4 i executed the launch of Chandrayaan-2 on its lunar journey on 22 July 2019 very beautifully
 aise ladkadaayavikram ko chandramaa par utaarne ke liye isro ne ek parabolic sanchalit tregectory taiyaar kii, jise chaar alag-alag charnon main vibhajit kiya gaya
 This process begins when the spacecraft reaches an altitude of about 30 km above the lunar surface and 650 km from the landing site
 pehle charan main, jise raf braking charan ke rup main janaa jaataa he or yah 10 minute 20 second tak chalata he, vikram apane injanon kii jabardast shakti kaa upyog karke apni kshaitij gati ko 1,648 meter prati second se ghataakar lagbhag 150 meter prati second tak karegaa
 In this phase, its distance from the lunar surface decreases from 30 km to 7
 4 kimi rah jaaegi
 Separating from orbit and moving freely around the moon, Vikram was fired along the exhaust funnel of his five engines, where the engines were facing towards its orbital direction, not the opposite direction
 utarane ke charan kii shuruyaat main, isamen lage computaron ne isaki gati ko teji se ghataane ke liye apane paanch main se chaar injanon ko start kar diya
 All four engines had to be started correctly and synchronously to ensure that both the horizontal (horizontal) and vertical (vertical) velocity of the vehicle was within the specified parameters
 agar injanon main se ek bhi apane nirdhaarit samay se thodaa sa bhi vichlit ho jaataa, to computer ko is tarah taiyaar kiya gaya tha ki vah anya injanon kaa upyog karke aavashyak thrust pradaan kar sake
 Live telecasts on Doordarshan showed scientists clapping on successful completion of the rough breaking phase
 lekin kuch visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki aise sanket hai ki isi charan main pareshaaniyaan paidaa honi shuru ho gai thim
 Horizontal velocity had to be around 150 meters per second at the end of the phase, but readings on the large console in the mission operations complex showed that it was about 200 meters per second, that is, much faster than it should have been
 duusari ore, vertical veg yaa jis gati ke saath lander neeche utar rahaa tha, vah kai second tak 70 meter or 68 meter prati second ke bich rahaa
 All this was happening in the second phase called the Absolute Navigation Phase (ANP) and it lasted for about 40 seconds
 is charan main, vikram ko raf braking charan ke dauraan isaki oonchai or veg vagairah ko lekar mukhya nevigation maapdandon kii gananaa main hui kisi bhi truti ko thik karnaa chahie tha
 Vikram double-checked (again) the readings of his on-board measuring equipment, including devices fitted to measure velocity and altitude, and cameras that took photographs of the lunar field
 antariksh yaan ke veg, oonchai yaa jhukaav main badlaav ko swytt niyantran pranaaliyon dwaara thik kiya janaa tha, jiskaa nirdhaaran ve khud apane taarkik nirnyon ke aadhaar par karte hai
 a senior scientist explains, "the number of efficiencies and errors you can calculate and feed into a computer is limited only to your imagination
 sabase acchhee niyantran pranali ve hai jahaan vaigyanikon ne aisa system banaaya jo apni kalpanaaon ko mukt rakhane main samarth ho or jitani aakasmiktaayen sambhav hai, utani se judi yojana system khud banaae
 "it was at this brief ANP stage that troubles began to increase in Vikram's controlled landing
" niyantran kaksh main, vikram ke utarane kii prakriya ko simulett (anukaran) karne vaale bade consol ne darshaya ki lander apane 45 degree jhukaav se kuch vichlit he
 This led to a dive that caused the engines that had to be downward to face upward (see graphic: 15 minutes of frustration)
 isaki ek vyakhya to yah he ki onboard computer spescraft kii disha ko sahi kar rahaa tha taaki camaron ko ise thik se pojishan lene main sakasham banaaya ja sake or un maapdandon ke hisaab se tasviren lee ja saken jiske liye ise taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 But this bet got heavy and due to this the speed of downward movement started increasing instead of decreasing
 isaki duusari vyakhya yah he ki niyantran pranali ne veg main giravat mahasoos kii or ise thik kiya, halaki yah veg tab bhi seemaa ke bheetar hi tha
 To do this he first accidentally swung the vehicle 140 degrees to increase the velocity, then reversed it to its original position
 lekin tab tak, antariksh yaan ne apni disha or niyantran ko kho diya tha
 Outside of control, it was the moment when the third phase, a total of 90 seconds, started the Fine Breaking Speed phase
 vikram kii kshaitij va lambavat, donon gatiyon ko takreeban shunya ke str par lekar aane or lander ko chand kii sataha se 400 meter kii oonchai tak lekar aane ke liye uske chaar main se do ingine band kiye jane the
 There is evidence that the spacecraft was trying its best to regain control and was sometimes hitching around here and there
 consol par saaf najar aa rahaa tha ki yaan kii lambavat gati bad gai thi or tab jaakar niyantran kaksh se uskaa sara sampark tut gaya
 There was also no evidence to know whether the two engines of the vehicle had stopped as planned
 consol se sirf yah pataa chal rahaa tha ki kshaitij gati tab bhi kaaphi zyada yani 48 meter prati second thi or lambavat gati 59 meter prati second thi
 Both of these standards should have been significantly lower when the lander entered the stage of landing at the last moment
 is maukey par uski gati takreeban shunya ke kareeb honi chahie thi or use chand kii sataha se kareeb 400 meter kii oonchai par shunya main mandaraate rahanaa tha
 ISRO had decided that Vikram would be landed on the surface near the relatively cold south pole of the moon as there was expected to be a greater presence of water particles
 yah pehali baar tha ki koi lander is tarah kii koshish karne vaala tha or isaki vajah bhi thi
 The surface around the poles is more pits than the surface around the lunar midline
 vikram kii niyantran pranali uske camaron or baaki upkarnon kii madad se yah sunishchit karne vaali thi ki vikram kisi samtal sataha par land kare
 If he had descended on any such surface, where the slope was more than 12 degrees, then Vikram would have turned as soon as he descended, that is, he would have rolled
 yah tay kar lene ke baad vikram ko das meter kii oonchai tak neeche utarana tha or tab yaan par lagi uski niyantran pranali uske do or ingine band kar detii
 All this was to happen when all the things would go on properly in the earlier phase
 lekin 2
 There was no evidence to know if the decisive landing phase was operational when it lost contact at 1 km altitude
 visheshgyon ke anusaar, vikram ke is achaanak khatme ke teen mukhya kaaran ho sakate hai, lekin unamem is baat ko lekar sahmati nahin he ki inamen se koun-sa kaaran sabase pramukh rup se jimmedaar he
 Some people believe that his propulsion system malfunctioned while the rough brake stage moved to the last navigation stage
 us samay uske saare ingine ko ek saath fire karnaa tha taaki lander kii gati kam kii ja sake
 These engines were based on new technology, so it is being suspected that any of those engines may have fired wrong
 iske kaaran sthitiyaan itani asthir ho gai hongi ki ve pranali ke bardaasht ke baahar ho gai or niyantran pranali isse bhramit ho gai hogi
 Some others believed that there was a flaw in the control system itself and an improper logic was built into it, which caused the lander to have a complete reversal between the last navigation and fine braking stages
 is bich isro ke vaigyanik signal tut jane se pehle tak lander dwaara bheje gaye har kism ke aankade kaa adhyayan kar rahe hai
 Using all those figures, they are creating all possible scenarios so that Vikram's landing can be understood
 aakhir antariksh badi nishthur jagah he or vah kisi galati ko nahin bakhshata
 But as an overall mission, Chandrayaan-2 has achieved many successes
 usne isro ke sabase bade prakshepak jieselvi mark III kii pramanikta ko siddh kiya he
 Most importantly, the satellite, that is, the orbiter itself, is working brilliantly and has eight major instruments which are transmitting all kinds of data about the moon and the presence of water on its surface
 isse duniya kii baaki antarikshawya takaton ko yah tay karne main madad mil sakati he ki kya kabhi chand par inasaani basti bas sakati he
 Scientists have received the Dr

 Rumors in the city and rural areas of North Bihar had caused the price of salt to reach Rs 100
 yahi nahin, log badi keemton par bhi badi maatra main namak kharidte najar aae
 Here, State Food and Consumer Minister Shyam Rajak, however, called it a complete rumor and said that there is no shortage of salt anywhere
 rajak ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki puure bihar main kahin bhi namak kii killat nahin he, yah sab afvaah he
 He appealed to people not to pay heed to the rumor and said that they should not buy from Kalabazar
 unhone kaha ki afvaahon kaa phayda uthaate hue dukandaar adhik keemat par namak bech rahe hai
 He said that the district officials of the concerned districts have been directed to investigate the rumors and take action against the guilty
 unhone namak ke kritrim sankat paidaa karne kii afvaah failaane kaa aarope bihar ke vipakshi dal bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) par lagaaya he

 Here, Samastipur District Magistrate Naveen Chandra Jha told that the news of increased price of salt is just a rumor
 unhone bataaya ki kuch logon ne namak kii kalabazari kii niyat se ise jamaa kar rakhaa he
 The subdivision officer has been instructed to take legal action against such people and carry out the operation

 - input IANS se The printing of notes of Rs 200 and Rs 500 notes has been interrupted at the note printing factory located in Nashik due to the run out of ink
 ek shramik netaa ne yah daawa kiya he
 Jagdish Godse, president of Raidkhana Kamgar Confederation, said, "the use of imported ink is used in the printing of notes, which is not yet available
" iske kaaran 200 rupee or 500 rupee ke noton kii chapai ruk gayi he
 '' Comments unhone kaha ki desh bhar main nakadi kii kami kii samasya ke peeche yah bhi ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 He, however, did not clarify when the printing of the notes had stopped
 yah tippanee aise samay aayi he jab sarkaar ne ek hi din pehle 500 rupee ke noton kii chapai paanch guna badhaane kaa aadesh diya he taaki agle maheene 75 hajaar karod rupee ke naye noton kii aapurti kii ja sake
 He said that this could also be a reason behind the problem of shortage of cash across the country
 haalanki unhone yah spasht nahin kiya ki noton kii chapai kab se band he
 This comment has come at a time when the government has ordered to increase the printing of 500 rupee notes by five times on the same day so that new notes of 75 thousand crore rupees can be supplied next month
 yah tippanee aise samay aayi he jab sarkaar ne ek hi din pehle 500 rupee ke noton kii chapai paanch guna badhaane kaa aadesh diya he taaki agle maheene 75 hajaar karod rupee ke naye noton kii aapurti kii ja sake
 Post demonetisation, the market is in a bad condition, many markets are closed, but the biggest problem is to meet the daily needs
 bade bade or thok bazaar band he, lekin ritel market main log ek duusari samasya se bhi jujh rahe hai
 This is the problem of holiday money
 8 november ko jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne elaan kiya ki ab 500 or 1000 ke note nahin chalenge, to hadakamp much gaya
 The attempt to curb black money was praised, but trouble came when people kept wandering for new notes
 yahi nahin apane puraane noton ko change karaane kii vyavastha main log mashkkat karte dikhe
 However, the government stated a complete plan to replace the old notes
 khate main jamaa karaane ke alaava atm or exange kii vyavastha lagu kii, lekin ye sab naakaafi sabit hue
 The biggest problem is the change for the common people, because people have old notes, till now they were getting two thousand notes from banks, this changed the old and out of date notes of the people, but the market i am not getting open or holiday money for two thousand notes
 desh kii arthvyavastha main kareeb 86 fisadi hissaa bade noton yani paanch sau or hazaar ke noton kaa tha, matlab bazaar main pehle hi 100 or 50 rupye jaise chote note kam maatra main the, aise main jab karency kaa ek kida hissaa chalan se baahar kar diya gaya, to chote noton kii kami bhi swaabhaavik thi
 Naveen Mitra, who runs the chemist in front of LNJP Hospital, is upset with this problem, it has been told in the newspapers and statements that 500 and thousand notes can be taken at the chemist shop, but now there is a problem, that people can replace old notes Chemists arrive at the shop to find the hideout

 iske alaava jo niyamit graahak hai unase change ke badale balance kii slip kaa system bananaa padaa he, jisamen bache hue paison ko aane vaale dinon main edjust kiya ja rahaa he
 Not only this, Deepak, who came to the hospital to take medicines for his patient, had a two thousand note, the bill was made of 180 rupees, but the difficulty was that the shopkeeper did not have the changes and Deepak had small notes to pay
 aise main pareshaani ab is baat kii he ki change kahaan se aaye
 Now, in addition to 2000, 500 new notes have also come to the banks, as well as arrangements are being made to claim 500 notes from Atom
 ummid kerani chahie ki aane vaale dinon main market main sarkaar chote note bhi zyada se zyada sankhya main chalan main laaegi, taaki chuttay kii samasya khatm kii ja sake

 Infinix S5 kii keemat 8,999 rupee herier main quad camera seoup diya gaya hessinthinid ne bharat main apane nae smartphone S5 ko launch kar diya he
 The company has introduced it in only one variant 4GB RAM + 64GB storage
 isaki keemat 8,999 rupee rakhi gai he
 Customers will be able to buy it from October 21 at 12 noon
 baharhaal hamane is smartphone ko thode se samay ke liye istemaal kiya he or ab ham iskaa quick rivyuu bataane ja rahe hai
 First of all, let us tell you that this smartphone has a punch hole display, quad camera setup and 32MP selfie camera
 bazaar main is smartphone kaa muqabla Redmi Note 7S or Realme 5 jaise phones se he
 The starting price of these two budget King phones is also 8,999 rupees
 tulanaatmak taur par Realme 5 nayaa smartphone he or iske spacifications Redmi Note 7S se bhi behatar hai
 In this case, it is better to compare the new Infinix S5 with the Realme 5 itself
 nae Infinix S5 main 6
 6-inch display, Android 9 based XOS 5
 5 Cheetah oparating system, octa-kor mediatek Helio P22 procesar, 4GB ram, quad rier camera seoup (16MP+2MP+5MP+2MP), 32MP selfi camera, 64GB storage or 4,000mah kii bydaree di gai he
 So, talk about the specifications of Realme 5, then 6 with Gorilla Glass 3+ Protection here
 5-inch HD+ (720x1600 picksal) disple, kwalkom snapadragon 665 procesar, android 9 pai besd Colour OS 6
 0, quad rear camera setup (12MP + 8MP + 2MP + 2MP) in the rear, 13MP camera for selfie in front and a large 5,000mah battery
 yani Infinix S5 keval panch hole disple luk or 32MP camere ke maamle main thodaa aage he
 However, speaking of first impressions of the new Infinix S5, this phone is well in terms of weight
 yani iskaa vajan zyada nahin he
 Its back panel is of plastic and there is a quad camera setup and fingerprint scanner in the rear itself
 lekin phone haath main kaaphi bada lagata he
 That is, it is a bit difficult for one hand handling
 back panel ke luk kii baat karen to yahaan dual tone gradient luk panel diya gaya he
 But seems quite audacious
 yani ise thodaa or aakarshak banaaya ja saktaa tha
 We have also seen better panels in the budget of Xiaomi and Realme phones
 baaki yahaan power batan or wolum rockers rhite kii hi taraf diya gaya he
 While 3 in the bottom panel
 5mm headphone jaik, spikar gril or charging port diya gaya he
 The SIM slot is placed in the left panel
 acchhee baat ye he ki yahaan memory card ke liye bhi alag se slot diya gaya he
 Talking about the front panel, here 6
 6-inch panch hole disple diya gaya he
 LCD panels have been used here
 yahaan colors or britaness bhi acha hi he
 90
 5 screen tu body reshyo hone kii vajah se movie dekhne or game khilne ke liye ye phone behatar he
 Overall build quality is good
 kahin raf agej bhi nahin he
 But the look of the rear panel is a bit audacious
 software part kii baat karen to yahaan custom XOS 5
 5 Cheetah operating system has been given and its control panel looks have been given better and necessary toggles
 lekin blottware kii bharmaar he
 a lot of preloaded apps are also provided
 haalanki inhen remov bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, App Drawer is also included here
 hardware kii baat karen to yahaan 4GB ram ke saath octa-kor mediatek Helio P22 procesar diya gaya he
 Is this processor outdated or not a perfect match for this price segment
 Realme ke 5,999 rupee ke phone C2 main ye procesar miltaa he
 While the Snapdragon 665 processor is available in Realme 5 for Rs 8,999
 baharhaal ap swimming or multi tasking jaise regular kaamon zyada lag nahin he
 But with the new processor, the phone could be a little more smooth
 saath hi anemation lag aasaani se dekh sakate hai
 Talking about the battery, a 4,000mah battery is provided here, which is also less than the 5,000mah of Realme 5
 baaki hamane philhal bydaree capacity yaa charging time ko check nahin kiya he
 Talking about the photography section, in addition to the primary camera, ultra wide angle camera, super macro camera and depth camera have been given
 overol taur par baat karen to de lite or artificial lite main hamen nijee taur par keval primary camera thik laga
 The performance of the rest of the cameras is not as good
 hamane ise lo-lite main tri nahin kiya he
 Talking about selfie, selfie here does not look real at all
 yani skin tone kaaphi artficial lagata he
 In such a situation, it is not so much better than smartphones like Realme 5

 Zarine says that when a big and established star performs a bold scene on the cinema screen, he is praised
 lekin vaisaa hi seen koi chota yaa kam sthapit cheharaa kare to use 'foohad' qaraar diya jaataa he

 But i do not let them dominate me
 mujhe aisi chizon se koi fark nahin padataa
 i have come here to do my work and i feel that i have learned all this in so many years
 ' Zarin feels that the real problem is that a large number of people in this country shrink their nose and mouth over the bold scene, but they are among the first few to see
 abhinetri ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki ham ek paakhandee desh main rahete hai
 Where people will say all the negative things about the bold scene

 They will definitely see
 kuch log hote hai jo is sab kii lakh buraai karenge, lekin dekhne waalon main awwal honge

 ab jamaana he online kharidari kaa, jisamen graahak ko hameshaa raja dikhaaya jaataa he
 But actually this does not happen many times
 vahaan par bhi vah dhokhaa kha jaataa he yaa saamaan mahange main kharid letaa he
 Not only this, in the greed of discount, he also buys some items which he does not need
 in sabase bachane ke liye ham aapako bataate hai kuch upaay, jin par amal karke aap apni gadhi kamai ko bachaa sakenge
 First of all, you have to see how much profit there is in the deal you are going to make
 darasal discount ke baavjood kai maamalon main duusare online retailor kahin behatar discount de rahe hote hai
 An example of this is Flipkart's cell, in which the macbook Air was priced at Rs 54,000, while on Snapdeal it was available for Rs 50,000 at that time
 aisa kai or saamaanon ke saath bhi hua
 Actually, online retailers exaggerate discounts
 aise main saavdhaan rahanaa jaruri he or bich-bich main duusari citon ko dekhte rahanaa uchit or laabhadaayak he
 The biggest danger in discount cell is that there is no scope of refund or exchange
 agar aapako koi product pasand nahin aayaa, to aap use badal nahin sakate, isliye aisi koi bhi cheez kharidne se bachein, jisamen aise halaat ho sakate hai
 These things are written in the conditions column on the online retailer's site
 credit yaa debit card se bhugtan karne se pehle soch len
 It is better that you take the facility of cash payment, which happens at the time of delivery
 isse phayda yah hoga ki agar aap baad main apana faisla badal dete hai, to aapako pareshaani nahin hogi
 Your money will be saved
 sara saamaan ek hi website se kharidne kii bajaay kai sari websiton par nigahen rakhen
 They also continue to promote and give big discounts
 kai tarah ke saamaan main behtareen chhot milti rahati he
 Register your name aisa karne se us website se milane vaali chhot kaa aap phayda uthaa sakate hai
 This means that if your name is registered with the online retailer, you will have an easy place to place the order
 lekin sabase badi baat to yah he ki aapako tay karnaa hoga ki jo saamaan aap kharidne ja rahe hai, uski jarurat aapako he yaa nahin
 Do not buy any goods that you do not need for the temptation of great discounts

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne logon ko bijli kii badi daron se badi raahat dete hue elaan kiya he ki ab se 400 unit tak kii bijli khapat par daren aadhi hongi
 The Aam Aadmi Party government, following its election promise, has made this second major announcement
 isse pehle pani kii supplai par dilli sarkaar ahm faisla suna chuki he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a subsidy on electricity after the cabinet meeting which would cost Rs 61 crore in the next three months
 is sabsidi se dilli ke 28 lakh upabhoktaaon ko laabh milegaa
 Subsidizing electricity was one of aap's major promises before the assembly elections
 sarkaar ne kaha he ki jo pehle se sabsidi di ja rahi thi, vah ab badha di gai he or ab kul milakar daren aadhi ho jaaengi
 Also, Kejriwal said that show cause notices have been sent to Delhi's power companies to conduct CAG audit
 kejariwal ne kaha ki sieji is puure maamle main bijli companiyon kaa audit karne ko taiyaar he
 Significantly, Kejriwal and his colleagues have been accusing three big private companies engaged in the distribution of electricity in Delhi for manipulating them
 unka aarope tha ki bijli kampanyaan herpher kar munaafe ko ghate main dikhaakar bijli ke daam badhaati ja rahi hai
 Let us tell you that in the Delhi elections, the Aam Aadmi Party promised the people to cut electricity rates by 50 percent
 is vaade ko kejariwal jald se jald puraa karnaa chaahate hai
 It is estimated that 70 per cent of the population living in Delhi will benefit in this way
 kejariwal ke bijli daron ko aadha karne ke vaade par dilli bijli regulatiri kamishan (dmarsi) ke chairman pidi sudhakar ne ahm bayaan diya he
 He has said in an interview to the Economic Times that the Delhi government does not have the right to reduce the electricity rate
 dilli main bijli vitaran karne vaali teen companiyaan hai, jinamein se do reliance kii hai or ek tata kii
 The Delhi government has 49 percent stake in the three power distribution companies
 dilli main khapat hone vaali 70 fisadi bijli baahar se aati he
 The annual revenue of the three power companies is about Rs
 15,000 crore
 agar sarkaar bijli ke daam 50 fisadi kam karti he to sarkaar par 7500 karod kaa boj padegaa
 Electricity companies claim that they are incurring losses of 11 thousand crores
 pichley 10 saal main unki laagat 300 fisadi badi he, jabaki upabhoktaaon ko di ja rahi bijli kii daren sirf 70 fisadi badi hai
 To say that companies are earning from surplus electricity is wrong
 non−peak aavar main dilli ke paas 20 se 30 fisadi sarplus bijli hoti he
 This electricity goes back to the grid at the rate fixed by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission

 unhone saansadon evam vidhayakon kaa vetan badaye jane kaa samarthan kiya
 Parrikar was speaking on Tuesday in the concluding session of the 16th All India Whips Conference held at a resort in South Goa
 parrikar ne daawa kiya ki jab ek vyakti nirvaachit pratinidhi banataa he, to uske aay ke duusare strot band ho jate hai, isliye vidhayakon, saansadon ko paryaapt vetan milanaa mahatvapurn he
 He said, 'I have the courage to say, when you become an MP or MLA it becomes like cocaine
 
 You can't do your business
 ' parrikar ne kaha ki aalochanaon ke baavjood unhone saansadon or vidhayakon kaa vetan badaye jane kii vakaalat kii thi
 He said, 'criticists do not understand this
 'parrikar ne kaha ki saansadon ko aavantit bangalon, phone, vimaan tikat or car ko use die gaye laabh ke rup main ginana anuchit he
 He said, 'if you do not provide a bungalow or a car to an MP, how will it reach the Parliament

 ' rajasthan bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke upaadhyaksh gyandev ahuja ne guuruuvaar ko congress adhyaksh ke janeu dhari hone ke daawey par sawaal uthaaya he
 He said that Congress should name the priest who organized the program for this
 gyaan dev ahuja ne guuruuvaar ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii tulana mughal badshaah aurangzeb se karte hue kaha ki congress kaa samrajya samaapt ho rahaa he
 They were talking to media persons
 unhone kaha ki congress adhyaksh aurangzeb kii tarah hi congress kii sultanate ke aakhri badshaah hai
 Like Aurangzeb was the last emperor of the Mughal Sultanate
 saath hi ahuja ne kaha ki congress kaa ant nishchit he
 However, let us tell you that the reality is contrary to the statement of the BJP leader
 darasal, 1707 main aurangzeb kii mrityu hui thi or vah uske vansh kaa antim nahin tha
 The last Mughal ruler was Bahadur Shah Zafar, who died in 1862
 lekin aurangzeb ko aksar pramukh mughal baadshahon main seantim ke taur par dekha jaataa he kyonki unke baad samrajya kaa vighatan shuru ho gaya tha
 Ahuja, a two-time MLA from Ramgarh in Alwar, claimed that the BJP would win the by-election for the Ramgarh assembly seat, where voting was canceled due to the death of Bahujan Samaj Party candidate Laxman Singh
 bataa den ki congress ne rajasthan kii baaki 199 vidhansabha siton main se 99 par jeet hasil kii
 The by-election for Ramgarh is to be held on 28 January
 aakhri vidhansabha main ahuja ramgarh se vidhayak the
 He was not given a ticket by the BJP in the December assembly elections
 iske baad unhone jaipur ke sanganer seat se nirdaleey chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya tha
 Please tell that Gyan Dev Ahuja has often been in controversies about his statements
 1 janvari ko hi purv vidhayak gyandev ahuja ne kaha tha ki gaumata sabaki he
 If Muslims do not believe then they should also obey
 parsi bhi gaay kaa maance nahin khate
 Muslim brothers should also not eat cow meat, respecting the feelings of their Hindu brothers
 go taskari kaa virodh bhi karen
 Gyan Dev Ahuja, former Rajasthan BJP MLA: Gau mata sabki hai, Musalman agar nahi maante toh unko bhi manna chahiye, Parsi bhi gai ka maas nahi khaate, musalman bhaiyo ko bhi apne Hindu bhaiyon ki bhavnao ka samman karte hue gai ka maas na , gau taskari ka virodh bhi karen

 input language kisi cese ke aaropee ke passport ko jabt karne or waapas karne ke maamle main patiala house kii special court ne sibiai or passport offis ko jamkar fatkaar lagaai
 The court has ordered CBI Director and Chief Passport Officer to make a guideline in this matter within 30 days
 special jaj bharat parashar ne sibiai se ye bhi poocha ki kol block main naveen jindal kaa passport jabt kyon nahin kiya gaya, jabaki is cese main do aropiyon ke passport jabt kiye gaye
 The court said that it is clear from these cases that the agencies decide the rules by looking at their faces
 ye manamaana tarika court ko manjuur nahin he
 During the hearing on the application of the accused in the coal block, the court had also summoned passport officers
 court ne kaha ki kuch maamalon main aap logon ko passport waapas lene ke liye court kaa aadesh maangate hai jabaki kuch maamalon main khud hi passport relies kar dete hai
 The judge also expressed deep displeasure in the case in which the RPO argued that he was doing hard presses in return of an accused's passport
 jaj ne kaha ki ye hard pres kya hota he, ye janata ko bhi bataaya janaa chahie
 People bang for passports every day, but they have no hearing
 agenciyaan bina kisa niyam ke kaam kar rahi hai
 The judge said that they are adopting the policy of pick and choose
 tippaniyan The special judge said that there are constant complaints in the court regarding confiscation and release of passports and in such a situation, if the officers do not take action then they will start trial in this case
 darasal, kol block maamle main kai aropiyon ne court main arji daakhil kar kaha tha ki passport offis unke passport relies nahin kar rahe hai

 court ne sibiai nideshak or chif passport afasar ko 30 dinon ke bheetar is maamle main guideline banane ke aadesh die hai
 Special Judge Bharat Parashar also asked the CBI why Naveen Jindal's passport was not confiscated in the coal block, while in this case the passports of the two accused were seized
 court ne kaha ki in maamalon se saaf hota he ki agenciyaan cheharaa dekhakar niyam tay karti hai
 This arbitrary approach is not acceptable to the court
 kol block ke aropiyon kii arji par sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne passport afasaron ko bhi talab kiya tha
 The court said that in some cases you ask for a court order to get the passport back to the people, while in some cases the passport itself is released
 jaj ne us maamle main bhi gahari naaraazgi jataai, jisamen ek aaropee kaa passport waapas karne ke peeche aarpeo kaa tark tha ki wo hard press kar rahaa tha
 The judge said that what this hard press is, it should also be told to the public
 log rojaanaa passport ke liye dhakke khate hai, lekin unki koi sunwaayee nahin hoti
 Agencies are operating without any rules
 jaj ne kaha ki pick and chooj kii niti apana rahe hai
 The comments special jaj ne kaha ki court main passport jabt karne or relies karne ke maamle main lagaataar shikaayatein aa rahi hai or aise main agar afasaron ne karrwai nahin kii to wo is maamle kaa trial shuru kar denge
 In fact, many accused in the coal block case had filed an application in the court saying that the passport office is not releasing their passports
 is maamle main court ne dilli or ranchi ke RPO or chif passport afasar ko talab kiya tha

 Sonia Gandhi may continue to be the president of the Congress for the time being, but the command of the Congress has passed into the hands of Rahul Gandhi
 land bill par sarkaar ke peeche hatane ko congress apni jeet maan rahi he or sehara rahul ke sir sajaane kii taiyaari joro par he
 In this regard, the Congress is organizing a Vijay Rally in Panipat, Haryana on 20 September, while Rahul Gandhi will be honored on 12 September
 bataaya jaataa he ki yuthcongressdeshbhar se kisaanon ko nyauta dekar rahul gandhi ko 12 sitambar ko congress mukhyalay main sammanit karne vaali he
 The responsibility of fighting the GST bill on behalf of the party has also been placed on Rahul's shoulders
 sonia gandhi kahati hai, 'rahul ke gidence main congress kaaryakartaaon ne land bill par badhiya andolan chalaaya
 'significantly, in the meeting of the Congress Working Committee in the past, Sonia Gandhi patted the son Rahul
 12 sitambar ke aayojan ke liye deshbhar se 5000 kisaanon mukhiyaaon ko bulaayaa gaya he
 The special thing is that these will be the peasant heads of the same states where Rahul went on a march
 jaahir he iske baad haryana kii vijay raily main bhi rahul kii hi shaan main kaside padhe jaaenge
 On the other hand, Rahul Gandhi has already conceded that he will strongly oppose the GST bill of the Modi government

 yahi nahin, rahul gandhi kaa congress netaaon ko sidhaa nirdesh he ki jaise land bill par ladaai jiti he, vaise hi jiesti bill par bhi peeche hatane kii jarurat nahin he
 This is interesting because seven years as Gujarat CM Narendra Modi also opposed GST
 kul milakar congress ab khulkar siyaasi ladaai ko rahul banaam modi sarkaar karne ke liye taiyaar dikh rahi he

 kya aap jaanate hai ki paseene main koi gandh nahin hoti
 When the bacteria of our body get mixed in sweat, only then the sweat starts to smell
 vahiin sharir main pani kii kami hone se bhi sharir se badboo aati he
 Apart from this, there can be many other reasons for bad breath
 1
 Due to stress, due to foul odor, our body sweats in excessive amounts
 is dauraan sharir main cortisol naam kaa hormone banataa he, jisaki vajah se esa hota he
 Excessive sweating causes stink after exposure to bacteria
 2
 Synthetic fabrics do not absorb sweat due to the selection of fabrics, whereas cotton fabric absorbs sweat very quickly
 agar aapako bahut adhik pasinaa aata he to behatar hoga ki aap reyon or polister jaise fabric kaa istemaal karne se bachein
 Due to the non-drying of sweat, bacteria start to grow in that place and then the smell starts
 3
 You may not believe it because of the perfume, but because of the taste you apply, your sweat also smells
 haalanki ye keval unhiin cents ke saath hota he jinamein anti-bacterial gun nahin hota
 In such a situation bacteria start to thrive
 4
 If you take too many medicines due to excessive intake of medicines, then it will also affect your body odor
 dawaaiyon main maujuud rasaynic tatv sharir kii gandh ko prabhavit karte hai
 In this case, sweat and body odor get converted into bad smell
 5
 By eating spicy, if you eat too much spicy food, then there is a smell coming from your body
 sharir kii ye gandh paseene ke saath milakar badboo paidaa karti he

 mujh par dosha madhne kii bajaae mere bos ne 120 mediakarmiyon ke saamne project ke safal na hone kii jimmedaari apane upar le lee
 When i succeeded the next year, they asked me to address the press conference instead of taking credit for it
 netritv kaa yah gun maine jivan main bahut pehle hi sikh liya tha ki naakaami main apane team kii jimmedaari khud par odhani hoti he or safalataa ko baantnaa hota he
 Many years later, when i became the President and came before the Office of Profit Bill, i felt that there were some problems, i asked Parliament to reconsider
 mere rukh ko lekar kaaphi vivaad hua tha
 
 
 a permanent committee had to be formed to study it, but i was firm in my decision
 aapane ek aam aadmi ke str par rah kar jivan ko dekha, baad main ek profeshnal nazariye se or pichley dasek saal main aap satta ke sheersh par rah kar chijen dekhte rahe
 Do you think there is any leader today who has the ability to take the blame on himself and share the success? (not laughing)
 
 
 is photo ko dekhen
 i consider it "political prestige"
 yah 2002 main lee gai thi jab meraa naam vaajapeyi ji or sonia ji donon ne hi prastaavit kiya tha
 
 
 In this, all the leaders are seen together
 is baar aapke naam kaa kya hua?is baar to kisi ne prastaavit nahin kiya
 Of course i was discussed in political parties but i was not nominated
 kuch logon ne mujhase chunaav ladane ko kaha
 i told them that i would convey my decision at the right time, and i did so
 lekin mamata banerjee or mulaayam singh yadav ne to aapkaa naam aage badhaayaa tha?(hansate hue) haa, use badha kar waapas bhi le liya gaya!mulaayam singh ke naam waapas lene ko aap kya maanate hai?pataa nahin, lekin maine mamata ko ek chitthee likh kar unke netritv sambandhi gunon kii saraahna jarur kii thi
 Leadership Qualities? Yes, she had come close to the throne
 yadi unhone system ke saath kadamtal kii hoti to unhen vah sab kuch mil jaataa jo ve chaahatin yaa kam se kam uskaa aadha to mil hi jaataa
 But he took a firm stand and missed the opportunity
 beshak ve apni sthiti waapas paa sakati hai
 He has both the courage and vision of a leader
 aapako vaaki lagata he ki mamata banerjee ke paas koi vijan he?pehle main yah bataa duun ki netaa kaa matlab kya hota he
 The leader should have vision and enthusiasm, he should not be afraid of any problem, but he should come to defeat the problem
 sabase jaruri yah he ki use puri eemaandaaree se kaam karnaa chahie
 And a leader should not even change his intentions in 24 hours! (laughs) i can only define a leader
 main aapako udhaaharan nahin de saktaa
 The whole country is watching this political drama (presidential election)
 mamata or mulaayam kii press conference ke din main ek din ke liye prabhaat khabar ke sampadak ke taur par bihar main tha
 i told the newspaper ten days in advance that if they want me to edit their newspaper, there should be an idea on the front page that brings a smile to the face of the people, farmers, fishermen, politicians or anyone That too should be the story of success
 unhone mujhe kamyaabi kii 20 kahaniyaan dikhain, maine usamen se chaar ko chunaa
 Also, i gave him a poem which was written for the youth of Bihar
 agar aapako is raashtrapati chunaav par kavita likhni ho to uski pehali pankti kya hogi?saahas, saahas, saahas!lekin kisi ne bhi saahas nahin dikhaaya! kya yah ek apil he?(hansate hue) maine sansad main prastaav diya tha ki partiyon ko vikaas kii raajnneeti par zyada vakt dena chahie
 If one party promises to end poverty within ten years, the other party should challenge it and promise to bring economic prosperity
 kaha ja rahaa he ki jis din aapane yah bayaan diya ki aap raashtrapati chunaav nahin ladenge, usase thik ek din pehle aapane ek bayaan taiyaar kiya tha jisamen apni ummidavaari kii vajahen ginai thim, or kaha tha ki aap kisi dal ke nahin, ''janata ke ummidavaar'' honge? kya yah sahi he?maine aisa koi bayaan kabhi taiyaar nahin kiya
 Did you consider yourself a candidate? Or did it mention to anyone privately? No, not at all
 mujhe kai netaaon ne phone kar ke chunaav ladane ko kaha or poocha ki yadi meraa naam sujhaayaa jaataa he to kya main chunaav main khadaa ho jaaoongaa
 Did Advaniji call you too? Yes, many people called
 kya mamata banerjee ne aapako kol kiya? or mulaayam singh ne?haa, sabhi ne mujhe kol kiya or chunaav maidan main utarane ke liye kaha
 Many were apprehensive whether i would contest the election or not
 to aakhir main aap ne raashtrapati chunaav na ladane kaa faisla isliye kiya ki aapke paas jeetne laayak number nahin the?itnaa hi nahin
 (pointing to a picture placed on the table) This picture is a reflection of an elegant parliamentary system
 main uskaa sapana dekhtaa hum or usee ke liye kaam karuunga
 But this picture is a hoax because the Congress deliberately did not accept your name this time? i want you to understand from this picture of 2002 how the parliamentary system should work - the leaders should work together in the national interest should do
 to kya us vakt ve isliye mil kar kaam kar sake kyonki atal bihari vaajapeyi pradhanmantri the?haa, netritv kaa fark padataa he
 a leader is a visionary and a missionary
 use kisi samasya kaa dar nahin hota, kisi kii nakal nahin karata, khud apni raah chunata he
 You made a statement that you were shocked by Mrs Gandhi's (prime Minister's position in 2004) claim
 yadi palat kar dekhen, to yah bataaie ki shrimati gandhi or manmohan singh ke saath aapaki pehali mulaakaat main asal main kya hua tha?unke (congress) chunaav jeetne ke baad mere paas kam se kam teen dinon tak party se koi milane nahin aayaa
 As it was the largest party, i called Mrs
 Gandhi to meet
 ve manmohan singh ke saath ain or bataaya ki party ne manmohan ko pradhanmantri bananaa tay kiya he
 Remember, despite the approval of the Supreme Court at that time, many parties were against Mrs Gandhi becoming Prime Minister
 mujhe unke pradhanmantri banane ke khilaaf kai patr bhi aae the jo maine sarkaar (congress) ko bhej die the
 So what was the government's response? Nothing, the government did not respond (laughs)
 subrahmanyam swami ne kaha ki aisa unke dakhal se hua tha, unhone naagarikta kaa mudda uthaaya tha
 Apart from this, there were SMS campaigns against Mrs Gandhi becoming Prime Minister
 swami ke alaava kai anya partiyon or vyaktiyon ne bhi mujhe likh bheja tha
 We must remember that despite all these publicity campaigns a judicial verdict had arrived
 jab supreme court ne kah diya ki shrimati gandhi pradhanmantri ban sakati hai, to main koun hota hum?to vah kya vajah thi jisane unhen pradhanmantri pad par daavedaari se roka?yah to sirf shrimati gandhi hi jaanati hai
 Did you meet Vajpayee ji after the election defeat? Many times
 unhone haar kii jimmedaari lee
 This is also a quality of leadership
 mujhe yaad he jab narsingh raav pradhanmantri hua karte the, main unka parmaanu urja kaarykram kaa vaigyanik salaahkaar tha
 Just before the 1996 elections, Mr
 Rao told me, "I am going to Tirupati, wait for the nuclear test
" '' tab kamyaabi pakki dikh rahi thi or ve iskaa jashn parmaanu pareekshan se manaanaa chaahate the
 Unfortunately they lost
 phir vijeta or parajeet, donon ne mujhe bulaayaa, ve mujhase milanaa chaahate the
 Rao asked me to inform the new Prime Minister about the nuclear program
 jab desh kii baat ho, to kaam chalate rahanaa chahie kyonki kisi bhi rajnatik dal se bada raashtra hota he
 There is a famous anecdote that you were blessed by Swami Sivananda in your youth
 bachapan main main pilot bananaa chahta tha
 When i grew up, i applied to the Air Force and i was called for an interview in Dehradun
 das dinon tak meraa kathin pariksha lee gai or ant main main medical test main fail ho gaya
 When i returned with a sad heart, i found Swami Sivananda on the banks of the Ganges, who was surrounded by thousands of devotees
 main aakhri pankti main baith gaya
 After a while, he caught sight of me and a French tourist
 unhone hamen aashirwad or vishvarupam diya, jo krishna ne arjuna ko diya tha taaki unke saare bhay dur bhaag saken
 The job was waiting for me when i returned to Delhi: Senior Scientific Advisor in the Ministry of Defense
 kitaab main aapane zikr kiya he ki aap subah kii namaaj (fajr) padhate hai
 Yes, everyday, whenever possible
 mere walid namaaj ko lekar bahut paband the or mujhe subah 4 baje jagaakar masjid le jate
 i also keep fasting
 to phir uttar bharat ke tathakthith muslim netaaon ko aisa kyon lagata he ki aap muslim hone ke saare ferj adaa nahin karte?sabase pehle main hindustani hum or ek acha insaan banane kii koshish karata hum
 People can say anything to me, it is a matter of their freedom of expression
 islam main meri aasthaa ko lekar koi shaq nahin he
 i also often go to temples and churches
 ishwar har jagah he
 When Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, you would often have a conversation with him
 aapkaa kya akalan he ki modi gujarat dangon ke liye doshi hai?gujarat dangon par faisla dena meraa kaam nahin
 This is the work of the judiciary
 lekin main vaajapeyi ke bare main ek or ghatana kaa zikr karnaa chaahunga
 When he took charge of the cabinet, i was a scientific advisor
 ek raat unhone mujhe apane daftar main bulaakar cabinet main ek pad dene kii peshkash kii
 i was busy with the fire and nuclear program
 agali subah main unase milane gaya
 He was sitting in his room and was adorned with sweets all around, sweets were his weakness
 maine unase khed jataate hue kaha ki main mantri nahin ban saktaa kyonki do program main vyast hum or us par asar padegaa
 Later, when my work was finished, i left the government and started teaching
 iske baad vaajapeyi ne mujhe bulaayaa or raashtrapati banane ko kaha
 Do you think Vajpayee used to blame Modi for the riots? i cannot speak on his behalf
 dange suniyojit the yaa achaanak ho gaye, ham nahin jaanate
 But no right-thinking person will support the wrong done to any community
 jab main gujarat gaya to isliye nahin ki pataa karun kya hua tha yaa phir modi galat the yaa sahi, balki meraa uddeshy raahat kaary main teji laana or logon kaa dukh-dard kam karnaa tha
 Nowadays there is a dispute about whether Modi can be the prime ministerial candidate or not
 aapkaa kya maananaa he?main kya sochataa hum, myne nahin rakhata
 Our country is democratic, the people of India will decide
 nitish kumaar or modi main se koun behatar pradhanmantri hoga?(hansate hue) mujhe vivaad main kyon khinch rahe hai
 i know both of them very well and both are good friends
 haal main aap nitish se mili the
 
 
 Yes, there was talk on presidential elections
 unhone mujhe bataaya ki endie main mujhe kaaphi samarthan hasil he lekin jeetne laayak number nahin hai
 That is, you decided not to fight on his advice? i also trusted my conscience, for me the voice of the heart is everything
 us samay aapane antaratma ko darkinar kar diya tha jab bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan pradhanmantri ne aapse baat kii thi or kaha tha ki sarkaar gir jaaegi?bihar ke rajyapal ne pradhanmantri ko likhaa tha ki vidhansabha niskriy ho chuki he or rajya sarkaar kii haalat khasta he
 The Prime Minister called me in Moscow and told him that the situation had come to a level of crisis
 unhone meri raay janani chaahi or kaha ki unhone cabinet kii baithak bulaai he
 i did some investigation at my level, then after an hour he got a call again and he told the decision of the cabinet
 phir maine soch-samaj faisla kiya
 But you have written in your book that you almost came to the verge of resignation? Yes, almost because the judiciary felt that i was sitting in Moscow and taking the decision, he did not know that i had minute-by-minute news
 Was keeping nyaaypalika ne rajyapal ko doshi paaya, to mujhe laga ki mujhe istipha de dena chahie
 But the vice-president was on a foreign tour so it took me a few hours to inform him
 us dauraan meri pradhanmantri se mulaakaat hui, lambii baatcheet main unhone mujhe rashtrahit main istipha na dene ko raji kar liya
 i did the same
 lekin kai log pad par bane rahane ke liye aisa hi bahaanaa banaate hai?mere maamle main aisa bilkul nahin he
 What have i had to stay in power? What will i gain by becoming president again? i don't want anything from anyone
 aaj desh ke saamne sabase gambhir khatra bhrashtachar kaa he
 If you were the Prime Minister, would Lokpal have passed the bill? Corruption is a continuous process (laughs)
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki anna (hajaare) ahm ladaai lard rahe hai, lekin yadi lokapal vidheyak paas ho gaya to isse sirf jelon main bheed hi badhegi
 Instead, i proposed a new movement for the youth below 35 years, called "what can i give"
 isamen sirf teen baaten hai: apni maa ko khush rakho, apane pita ko bhrashtachar se dur rakho or ped-paudhe lagaakar paryaavaran ko bachaao
 When Anna heard this idea of mine, he said that it would take a long time to get results from this mantra, but only mechanical confinement will be settled by his mechanical process
 logon ke dil or dimag main koi badlaav nahin aayega
 Anna Hazare says that 15 ministers are corrupt
 jab aap pad par the, to aapako sarkaar main kitna bhrashtachar dikhataa tha?(hansate hue) maine hisaab nahin lagaaya

 However, due to the promptness of the administration, there was no loss of life or property in this accident

 bharat kii naaraazgi se avichlit pakistani videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne bhartiya grih sachiv ji ke pillai kii tulana jamaat-ud-daawa ke pramukh hafiz said se karne ke apane bayaan ko tarksangat tehraate hue kaha he ki yah ‘‘santulit’’ tha
 Qureshi, breaking his silence on the issue that sparked controversy over the July 15 remarks, said there was no justification for Pillai's unnecessary statements
 unhone kaha ki in tippaniyon se videsh mantri es em krishna ke saath unki baatcheet kaa maahaul kharaab ho gaya
 Pakistan's foreign minister said in an interview via email, "there is no doubt that Pillai's statement was unnecessary
" ’’ pillai ne kathith taur par kaha tha ki iesai ne shuru se ant tak mumbai hamalon ko niyantrit kiya or isamen samanvay kiya tha
 He said, "there is no proper basis for such public comments that do not help the Indian official before the Foreign Ministers meet
" ’’kuraishi ne kaha ki donon pakshon ko aise nakaaratmak vaktavyon se bachanaa chahie jo maahaul ko dooshit karte hai
 He said, "tell me to what extent Pillai's comments made before the conversation helped
 ’’ said par bharat ne 26 november ke hamale sahit kai hamale karne or desh ko lakshya bana kar jehad ko uksaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Qureshi said about his comments criticizing Krishna and others, "my statement was balanced
" ’’ unhone kaha ki vah ek sawaal kaa jawaab de rahe the or yah bataane kii koshish kar rahe the ki aise tatv seemaa ke donon ore hai jo nahin chaahate ki donon deshon ke bich saamaanya sambandh hon tathaa aise log apane katu bayanon se dwipaksheeya maahaul ko dooshit karne ke liye prayasarat hai
 Qureshi's response was also sought to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's statement that the way everything happened in the press conference diverted attention from the achievements of the talks
 unhone kaha ‘‘mere vichaar se yah yaad rakhana mahatvapurn he ki donon pakshon ke bich baithak hone ke baad hi samvaadadaata sammelan hua tha
 "he said" The basic point of the matter is that India's initiative was selected and it was contrary to the agreement between the Prime Ministers of the two countries in Thimphu
 thimpu main bani sahmati ke anusaar, sabhi muddon par charchaa honi thi
 "qureshi said," As a democratic country, we are accountable to our people
 hamaare logon ko sach jaanane kaa adhikaar he
 Qureshi was asked whether he felt that Pillai's comments worsened the atmosphere for foreign ministers to negotiate
 unhone jawaab diya, ‘‘haa, main aisa sochataa hum
 Your media also commented on this
 yahaan tak ki krishna ne tivi par die apane ek saakshaatkaar main saaf kaha ki pillai ne jo kaha, uske liye samay anukool nahin tha
 He said that both sides are committed to avoid propaganda against each other
 unhone kaha ki donon deshon ne 15 july kii baithak main acha maahaul banane ke liye prayaas kiye the
