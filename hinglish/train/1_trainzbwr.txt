 The director of the film 'ki and Ka' is R
 Balki and 'ki' means Kiya, Kareena Kapoor and 'ka' means Kabir is Arjun Kapoor
 film main inke saath hai rajit kapur, swaroop sanpat saath main mehmaan bhoomika main hai, amitabh bachchan or jaya bachchan
 In the film's story, Kareena Kapoor is a working woman who lives with her mother and Arjun Kapoor is the son of a very big businessman
 arjuna kapur yani kabir kaa jindagi ko lekar falsafa kuch or hi he
 He neither wants to join his father's business nor do any other work
 vah apni maa jaisaa bananaa chaahate hai yani ghar sanbhaalanaa chaahate hai or jab kiya yani karina kii mulaakaat kabir se hoti he to donon ek-duusare ko shaadi ke liye bilkul sateek lagate hai
 They get married, but then their lives bring pride and jealousy
 aage kii kahani cinema haul main tikat lekar dekhen to behatar hoga
 Now my opinion about the film in which the first thing was the flaw
 pehali khami film kaa shuruaati hissaa jahaan nirdeshak aar balki kabir kii filosphi darshakon tak pahunchaana chaahate hai, jo kisi skool kii class jaisaa lagata he
 There could have been more to it than just a way of saying it
 film kii scrypting or scrinple main thodaa or gaharaai main jane kii zarurat thi
 Toy trains have been used extensively in many scenes of the film
 yahaan tak inkaa ghar bhi kisi platefarm se kam nahin lagata
 According to the film's philosophy, i understood the use of trains, that is, the train of life will not run without two tracks
 pati or patni par set yaa baaki kaa tamzam film ke vishay par haaavee hota dikhaa
 So these were the shortcomings of the film
 ab baat khoobiyon kii, jisamen sabase pehle baat film ke vishay kii gender equality yani ling samanta apane aapmen ek badi bahes kaa vishay rahaa he
 Creating him in this way is a praise-worthy one, even when the number of working women in cities has increased a lot today
 har ghar main ghar sanbhaalane ko lekar bahes he, duusari baat aar balki ne yah kahani un mahilaon par focus karne kii kaamyaab koshish kii he, jo ghar sambhalati hai, yani house wirus hai, jinke kaam ko kaamkaaji samaaj andekha karata he
 The comments aar balki house wif ko artist bataate hai
 Talking about acting, Kareena Kapoor has a good and good acting
 vahiin arjuna kapur bhi apane kirdaar main ekadam feet hai
 In many places in the film, he uses his body language well according to the situation
 swaroop sanpat kaaphi dinon ke baad nazar ain
 His character seems a bit awkward in writing, but his work is good
 film kaa gaanaa 'ji hajuri' or 'most wanted munda' jabaan par thaharte hai or achche hai
 This film also makes you laugh and pinch
 film main amitabh bachchan or jaya donon ko ek saath dekhakar acha lagata he
 Also, if you like the scene of these two, then overall 'key and Ka' is a watchable film, but don't expect that you are going to see some deep philosophy film
 is film main halke-phulke manoranjan ke saath thodaa-sa jindaga kaa falsafa he or meri ore se is film ko 3 stars

 somvaar ko sonia gandhi par nishaanaa sadhate hue bijepi netaa nitin gadakari ne un par desh ko gumraah karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Union Minister for Roads and Transport Nitin Gadkari on Monday urged Congress President Sonia Gandhi to cooperate with the government in passing the land bill in the national interest without doing politics
 unhone sonia gandhi ko khuli bahes kii chunauti di he, taaki desh ke saamne sari sthiti saaf ho jaae
 Gadkari has been tasked by Modi to convince opposition parties on the land bill
 isi kram main sonia gandhi ko likhe patr main unhone kaha, 'meraa maananaa he ki is tarah ke mahatvapurn muddon par rashtrahit ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kaam karnaa chahie na ki raajnneetik aadhaar par
 In the letter, he alleged that the previous Congress-led UPA government had enacted a law in which the provision of land acquisition for the private sector was simple but difficult for the public sector
 gadakari ne poocha, 'samprag sarkaar ke kanoon main anuchhed 105 ke tahat bade paimaane par bhoomi adhigrahan ko samaajik prabhaav ke moolyankan ke daayre se baahar kyon rakhaa gaya he
 He alleged that the UPA government had deliberately made such arrangements
 unhone poocha, 'kya aapane aisa nijee kshetra kii companiyon ko phayda pahunchane ke liye kiya tha
 He said, "under your Land Acquisition Act, thousands of hectares of land could have been acquired in the name of coal block, that too without any social assessment, but if the state government wants even one hectare of land for school or road or irrigation project
 So they had to go through a long and difficult process

 Terming the bill as anti-farmer, Sonia had alleged that the government was surrendering completely to benefit the industrialists
 is aarope kaa jawaab dete hue gadakari ne kaha, 'pichhali sarkaar ne jaanboojhkar ek vyavastha banaai jisamen badi bhoomi adhigrahan pariyojnaayen akalan ke baahar thim jabaki rajya sarkaar dwaara sanchalit kalyaan pariyojnaayen isamen fansi hui thim

 Topics such as history of terrorism, terrorism in India and the infamy of Islam by terrorism are also included in this course
 ye nayaa course ruhelkhand ke 48 madrason main shuru kiya gaya he
 But there are plans to gradually spread it across the country
 is tarah ab in madrason ke chaatr islam kii talim ke saath-saath dehshatgardi ke bare main bhi padhenge, kyonki dehshatgard islam ke naam par hi dehshatgardi kar rahe hai
 The flag of ISIS, the world's most dreaded terrorist organization, has also written 'allah' and 'mohammed'
 lihaaja mufti kii padhai karne waalon ko padhaayaa jayega ki kis tarah aatankwaadi islam ko badnaam kar rahe hai
 Mufti Mohammad Salim Noori of Bareilly, who started this course, says - saleem nuri ne kaha, "aatankwaadi dharm ko opium kii tarah istemaal karte hai
 Every question that arises in the mind of a new terrorist in terrorist training camps is answered by misinterpretation of the Quran and Hadith, so that there is no regret in spreading terror
 unhen bataaya jaataa he ki kafir ko jinda rahane kaa koi haq nahin he
 Momin has a stake in both Kafir's life and property

 If we are martyred after fighting the Kafirs, then there will be sacrifices in heaven
 " tippaniyan But in this anti-terrorism course, the correct explanation of all these issues will be taught, so that students who become muftis can understand the lies of terrorists
 quran kii sura al kafirun kii aayat number-109 padhai jaaegi jo kahati he, "main uski ibaadat nahin karata, jisaki tum karte ho
 And you do not worship what i do
 
 
 tumhaara dharm tumhaare saath or meraa dharm mere saath he
 "and Surah al-bakra's verse number-256 of the Quran will also be read which says, there is no coercion about religion

 Mufti Salim Noori says that we will teach students both interpretations of the Quran
 ek vah jo sahi he or duusari vah jo aatankwaadi bataata he
 Then we will also tell the students what is its reference context
 kaise aatankwaadi quran kii kisi aayat ke adhure hisse ko out of context (sandarbh se pare) uddhrut kar uskaa matlab badal detaa he
 
 
 It will be open to the eyes of the people
 majahab ke naam par jo brain wash kiya jaataa he, usamen bataaya jaataa he ki asli jindagi marane ke baad hasil hogi, jab marane ke baad jananath main huuren milengi, jo hameshaa jawan rahengi
 One incident of this brain wash told me by a senior journalist of Pakistani origin working in an English newspaper in Dubai that a terrorist was unconscious after being wounded in a suicide attack in Pakistan
 aspataal ke isiu main jab use hosh aayaa to apane kareeb khadi nurse se poocha ki baaki huuren kahaan hai? agar is nae course kii talim failaai jaae to jarur logon ko samaj main aayega ki yah islam nahin, sirf dehshatgardi he
 This new course has been started in 48 madrasas of Ruhelkhand
 lekin ise dhire-dhire puure mulk main failaane kii yojana he
 In this way, now students of these madrasas will read about the training of Islam as well as the horror, because the terrorists are terrorizing in the name of Islam itself
 duniya ke sabase khoonkhaar aatankwaadi sanghathan iesas ke jhande par bhi 'allaah' or 'mohammad' hi likhaa he
 In terms of studies received Mufti will be taught to those who are kind discredit militant Islam

 isse pehle relies hue trailor ko mixd vyuj mili the or ise logon ne khub pasand bhi kiya tha
 In which the comedy of John Abraham Arshad Warsi and Pulkit Samrat is seen
 film ke trailor main dekha ja saktaa he ki isamen kamedi ke saath ection bhi bharpoor he
 In the film, Arshad, John and Pulkit have done tremendous comedy on the one hand, on the other hand, Anil Kapoor and Saurabh Shukla have also played a role in the film
 anil kapur kaa role film main welcome movie ke role se kaaphi miltaa-julata najar aa rahaa he
 Sri Lanka senior batsman Kumar Sangakkara, desperate for his first win in the tournament, made a good effort to play 'mindgame' ahead of the match against India on Tuesday in the tri-series
 sangakaara ne kaha, ‘‘bharat ke khilaaf bharat se baahar hamane hameshaa acha pradarshan kiya he
 India has always been doing well on its own
 vahaan maidan chote hote hai or paristhitiyaan uske anukool hoti hai
 But outside his house we always did well against him
 ’’ India have played six matches with Sri Lanka in Australia and they have lost only one of them
 england main bhi paanch match main bharat ko keval ek haar mili he
 Both teams have clashed only once in South Africa and India have won
 yah sahi he ki bharat 2007 vishwa cap main srilanka se haar gaya tha or srilanka main usne 19 match jite or 26 haare lekin overal uskaa apane is padosi desh ke khilaaf acha record rahaa he
 Even in Sri Lanka, India won ten out of the last 17 matches
 bharat ne apni sarajameen par srilanka se 29 match jite or 11 haare he
 In total, India won 69 matches from Sri Lanka, lost 50 and lost 11 matches
 sangakaara kaa kahana he ki unki team ko toornament main bane rahane ke liye chah lig maichon main chaar main jeet darj kerani hogi
 He said, "you have to win at least four matches to reach the finals
 hamaare paas kal ek or avasar hoga
 '' australia main bharat ne srilanka se chah match khele hai or unamem se usne keval ek match ganvaaya he
 In England too, India have lost only one in five matches
 dakshin africa main donon timen keval ek baar bhidi hai or usamen bharat jeeta he
 It is true that India lost to Sri Lanka in 2007 World Cup and they won 19 matches and lost 26 in Sri Lanka but overall they have a good record against this neighboring country
 yahaan tak ki srilanka main bhi pichley 17 match main bharat ne das main jeet darj kii
 India has won 29 matches and lost 11 matches to Sri Lanka on their land
 kul milakar bharat ne srilanka se 69 match jite, 50 haare or 11 match kaa parinaam nahin niklaa
 Sangakkara says his team will have to win four out of six league matches to stay in the tournament
 unhone kaha, ‘‘aapako finels main pahunchane ke liye kam se kam chaar match jeetne honge
 We will have another opportunity tomorrow

 unhone kaha tha ki mahabharat ke dauraan sanjay ne baithkar dhritarashtra ko bataaya tha ki yuddh main kya ho rahaa he
 How can Sanjay see through the eye
 iskaa matlab he ki us samay bhi takanic, internet or satellite tha

 When the new CBI Director Anil Sinha was asked questions regarding the discharge of the court by BJP President Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin encounter case, he started teaching the media
 sibiai ne nae saal main sabhi beet ke patrakaron ko chaay par bulaayaa tha or ve sab jaananaa chaahate the ki kya sibiai amit shah ke khilaaf apil daayar karegi, lekin anil sinha patrakaron ke in sabhi sawaalon se bachate rahe
 He did not give any answer as to why the CBI argued for only 45 minutes, and why the CBI was represented in the Supreme Court by Pinky Anand, who was a BJP spokesperson
 lagaataar sawaal puche jane par anil sinha ne kaha, "aap mujhase cese kii baarikiyon ke bare main puch rahe hai, ve main kaise bataa duun
 
 
 ? "interestingly, after this, Director Sahab also argued an argument used in the film 'law', and said," The whole film debated a few minutes, but the decision was reached
 
 
 " iske baad bhi jab patrkaar lagaataar jawaab ke liye jor dete rahe, unhone taka-sa jawaab diya, "mujhe zyaada sawaalon ke jawaab dene kii aadat nahin, main sawaal poochta hum
 
 
 " yahaan yah bataanaa jaruri he ki sibiai nideshak banane se pehle bhi anil sinha hi soharabuddin maamla dekh rahe the, so, jin baarikiyon ke bare main baat karne se vah batch rahe the, un sabase vah acchhee tarah waakif hai
 Anyway, the CBI has been criticized in almost every case in the recent past, so the new director should focus on his image, but the CBI Director Saheb continues to teach the media a lesson
 ullekhneey he ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko soharabuddin maamle main aropamukt qaraar die paanch din biit chuke hai, lekin sibiai aaj tak rata-rataya jawaab hi de rahi he, or yah tak nahin kah paa rahi he ki vah faisle ke khilaaf apil karegi

 The Libyan people had once regarded Muammar Gaddafi as their hero
 vakt badla or gaddaphi kii fitrat bhi badali, to bahut saare logon ko apane is nayak main khalanaayak najar aane laga
 This is the reason that after 42 years, Gaddafi and his rule ended up as dictators
 gaddaphi kaa janm 1942 main marusthaleey shahar sirte main hua tha
 He grew up and joined the army
 27 saal kii umr main gaddaphi achaanak us vakt libyavaasiyon kii najaron main nayak ban gaye, jab 1969 main shaasha shah idris ke khilaaf takhtapalat kiya gaya
 After Gaddafi took power of Libya after the coup, people led by him cherished dreams of their future
 haalanki ye sapane hakeekat main tabdeel nahin hue
 Gaddafi was always in the spotlight regarding his cool attire and lifestyle
 libya main aaj bhale hi unke shashan kaa patakshep ho gaya ho, lekin varshon tak 60 lakh libyavaasiyon kii jindagi main kisi na kisi tarah se gaddaphi kii maujuudagi bani rahi
 While in power, Gaddafi saw many bad times in the context of world community relationships
 america ke purv raashtrapati ronaald reagan ne ek baar unhen ‘pagal kutta’ qaraar diya tha
 Gaddafi was also blamed for the 1988 Pan Am plane explosion
 yah ghatana scotland ke lokarabi main hui thi, isliye is ghatana ko aamtaur par ‘lokarabi visphot’ ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 270 people were killed in this explosion
 varshon tak gaddaphi ke adhinsth libya is ghatana main apni sanliptata se inkaar karata rahaa, lekin 2003 main usne isaki jimmedaari sweekaari or peedit parijanon ke liye ek karod dollars kii raashi dene par bhi sahamat hua
 Gaddafi also announced the elimination of all his WMD
 unhone khud ko libya ke aadhyatmik maardarshak ke rup main pesh kiya
 He exercised strictness in every way during his rule in Libya
 yahaan tak ki media par bhi sarkari niyantran bana rahaa
 Gaddafi was also accused of imprisoning hundreds of his people and sentencing many to death
 unke shashan ke dauraan yatnaaen die jane or logon ke laapata hone kii khabaren aati rahati thim
 Gaddafi was also known for his tough tongue
 unhone pradarshnakariyon ke khilaaf karrwai ke dauraan tivi par die apane ek sambodhan main kaha tha ‘ek-ek inch, prayek kamare or ghar main jaakar karrwai karo
 On the global stage, Gaddafi's main focus was on the Arab world and later he also focused his attention on Africa
 unhone misr or israel ke bich 1978 main hue ‘camp david’ shanti samjhaute ke virodh main arab jagat ko lamaband karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 He was also known for his anti-american stance
 gaddaphi ke rahane kaa andaaj puri tarah kabyli tha
 He did not stay in Panchsitara hotels even on foreign tour, but put a grand tent and stayed in it
 unke suraksha ghere main sashastr mahilaayein hoti thim

 doctors de par baat un rishtedaaron kii jo kisi bhi myne main doctor se kam nahin hote hai
 Every relative is a potential doctor, who comes to you as soon as you fall ill
 doctors agar bhagwaan kaa doosraa rup hai, to rishtedaar bhi unheen kaa koi mayavi rup hote honge
 Every single congratulatory message on Doctor's Day should be sent to all the relatives who know how to treat Ebola to low fever
 rishtedaaron kii ek aadat hoti he, wo aapaki sehat ko lekar hameshaa phikrmand hote hai, do ghante baad bhi aapako dekhen, to sehat main ai giravat bhaanp sakate hai
 Every relative has pathology in himself, who can tell all diseases without taking out a drop of blood, remove body mass index from eyes and touch temperature by knowing the forehead
 rishtedaar khatarnaak hote hai, beemaari ke maamle main wo or khatarnaak ho jate hai
 God forbid, if he has suffered the same disease then God himself cannot save you
 rishtedaar samdarshi hote hai, unki ankhen sookshmdarshi hoti hai
 If the aunt of his brother-in-law is also half-dead thirty years ago, then the whole world is seen holding his head
 aapaki ankhen baari hai, sir dard kar rahaa he, gale main jaraa si anthan he, wo ise bhi ardh kapaari bataa daalenge
 Even if you have a blemish, you know that the pain is just from working without resting in front of the computer for a long time, they will not believe it is a half cup, because the aunt of his tau's brother-in-law also had it thirty five years ago
 rishtedaaron kaa fevorett rog vaat hota he, sir ghumaakar puch lijiye aapako har doosraa rishtedaar vaat rog kaa specialist milegaa
 They can tell you the case history, can count tens of experiences, from the name of the patient to the days spent in treatment and the total expenses
 is rog ke ilaaj bhi bade mjedaar hote hai, koi machhlee kaa tel lagane kii salaah degaa, to koi sarson ke tel main garam kar papite ke pattey lagavaayega
 On a similar occasion, my grandmother gave the oil to my grandmother, which glowed like radium at night, what was the cure, we put her in the matrix-matrix game every night
 sabase zyada jo maar jaataa he wo rishtedaaron kaa confidence he, har aane vaala itane vishwaas se ilaaj bataata he ki beemaari khud kaanp jaati hogi
 The curer himself seems to have come so prepared that the illness seems to be lacking in homework
 bimariyon kaa maanvikaran hona chahie, unhen bhi shabd milane chahie, wo bataaengi ki kai lakshan to pehle unamem paae hi nahin jate the, rishtedaaron ko sun baad main develop karne pad gaye
 The name of the doctor should never be taken in front of such relatives
 apane anubhavon se wo use naakaara sabit kar denge, nazle main rishtedaaron ke bataae anusaar cancer kaa ilaaj karaate rahanaa chahie, bhale aap hafte kii teen suyiyaan tunchavakar thik hue hon
 When relatives ask, i am cured by eating ghee and catechu in basil leaves
 aap beemaari se batch sakate hai, doctor se batch sakate hai, rishtedaaron se nahin batch sakate

 There was no ear-to-ear news that the BJP would do such a game in the night
 yahaan tak ki congress-ncp or shivasena aaj hi rajyapal ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne vaali thi
 However , there is no disclosure of how many mlas have gone with Ajit Pawar 
 dekhne vaali baat yah hogi ki bijepi ajit pavaar ke sahare vidhansabha main bahumat sabit kar paaegi yaa nahin
 Let us tell you that in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, BJP has got 105 seats, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44 seats
 bijepi or shivasena ne milakar bahumat kaa 145 kaa aankada paar kar liya tha
 But Shiv Sena kept demanding 50-50 formula according to which the model of running the government was two and a half years
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath samjhauta isi formule par hua tha lekin bijepi kaa daawa he ki aisa koi samjhauta nahin hua
 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken

 In those days, a junior sub-editor worked in a national newspaper
 hindi sahityaka chaatr rahaa to kitabon or unhen likhane waalon main khaas dilchaspee thi
 Friends and seniors were also the same people who were concerned with the world of books
 aise hi hamaare ek mitra ne ek din bataaya kii samyaantar kaa salanaa samaaroh kaa mauka he, or usamen adhiktar bade naam najar aaenge
 When i also asked to go there, he immediately said yes
 9 disambar kii shaam main vahaan apane sabhi mitron ke saath pahunch gaya jo pankaj bisht kii patrika se jude the
 i was often happy to meet many of my favorite writers today, who often cut a canoe from a circle of writers
 disambar kii shaam dhundhalki ho chali thi, or andhera bhi thodaa gaharaa gaya tha
 The process of writers coming also started
 mulaakaat rajendra yadav se hui
 It was nice to see them, then Asghar Wajahat, Maitreyi Pushpa and Pankaj Bisht got the most
 sab hi bolne main mjedaar the
 Everyone had read it, so the fun of meeting was double
 sabase zyada dhyaan jis lekhak ne khinchaa vah naam pankaj singh kaa tha
 At that time, i had not even read one of his poems
 unka naam yada-kada doston se suna tha
 But there was nothing to read
 main samyaantar ke is ank par sabase hastakshar le rahaa tha taaki yah shaam yaadgaar ban sake
 So when i went to Pankaj Singh, he asked my name in his familiar style, laughing and in a loud voice, and with his sign on the book, slapped me lovingly on my back and encouraged me to say that ever before
 To meet then mujhe bahut acha laga
 While all the people had very lovingly asked for my name and signed it, Pankaj Singh's hand on my back and asked me to meet, had a magical effect
 phir ek din maine kaha dekhen unhen meraa naam yaad he ki nahin
 When i called him and told him the name, he immediately recognized me
 maine milane ke liye kaha, to unhone kaha ki kabhi bhi pehle bataakar aa janaa
 a few days later i reached him with time
 jaise hi main mayur vihaar ke east stand main sthit unke ghar par pahunchaa to unhone badi garmjoshi se meraa abhivadan kiya
 It was raining outside
 vahaan main baitha to barish or joro kii hone lageen
 He started talking about poetry and Marxism
 unhone mujhase chaay ke liye kaha to maine haa kar di
 When tea came, i lost my sweat
 kaali chaay thi, jo mujhe katai pasand nahin thi, phir pankaj singh ne kaha ki isamen neembu daal lo majaa doguna ho jayega
 When i put it, there was a tremendous cultural shock
 main malai vaali chaay pine vaala insaan vah chaay nahin samaj sakaa
 As soon as that glass was broken
 shaayad ve is baat ko samaj gaye to unhone kaha ki acchhee nahin lag rahi to rahane do
 i did not say anything and finished the tea
 unke chehre par muskaan thi, or haa unhone chaay nahin pi thi kyonki unke daant se khun aa rahaa tha
 After that a lot of things happened from my career to his journey
 unhone mujhe thodaa pareshaan dekhakar kai hausale badhaane vaali baaten kahin, or teen chaar kavitaayen bhi sunaayi
 But i was sitting there with many doubts related to the future, and perhaps that is why the title of his poem "the Future" remained alive in my mind
 jisaki panktiyaan kuch is tarah habkoi ek akshar bataao / koi rang / koi disha / kisi ek phool kaa naam lokoi ek dhun yaad karo / koi chidiya / koi maah--jaise baishakh / khaane kii kisi priy chiz kaa naam lokoi khabar doharaao / koi vigyaapan / koi hatya--jaise naksaliyon kii / kisi ek jail kaa naam local tum kahan honge / maaloom ho jayega

 Krishna rejected the claim that Jammu and Kashmir is not an integral part of India
 pakistan ke raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari dwaara shuru hua vaak yuddh us samay or aage bad gaya, jab sanyukt raashtra main pakistan ke up sthai pratinidhi raja bashir taraar ne kaha ki jammu-kashmir kabhi bharat kaa abhinn hissaa nahin tha
 Using Pakistan's 'right to respond', Tarar also said that in the Zardari speech last week, according to the UN resolution, there was talk of resolving the Kashmir issue and it was not 'undesirable'
 ise (sanyukt raashtra ke prastaav ko) bharat ne hameshaa ‘‘gaiyr jaruri’’ kah kar asweekaar kiya he
 Last year Pakistan did not make any provocative statement on Kashmir
 pakistan kii videsh mantri hina rabbaani khaar yahi kahati raheen ki pakistan kashmir samet anya sabhi lambit muddon ko bharat ke saath milakar suljhaana chahta he
 Krishna said, 'I did not expect Zardari to speak in terms of Kashmir and it is certainly India's responsibility to mention his position when the issue is mentioned at the highest level with Pakistan in the United Nations
 ’ videsh mantri krishna kii tippanee aise vakt ai jab sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main kashmir mudde par unki tippanee par pratikriya vyakt karte hue pakistan ne daawa kiya ki jammu kashmir kabhi bharat kaa abhinn hissaa nahin rahaa he or kaha ki mudde par jaradaari kaa bayaan ‘avaanchit’ nahin tha
 Krishna, in his address to the 193-member General Assembly, said that "unwarranted" remarks were made about Jammu and Kashmir from the UN forum
 ‘ham yah puri tarah spasht kar dena chaahate hai ki jammu kashmir bharat kaa abhinn hissaa he
 The Foreign Minister said on Tuesday that his remarks on Kashmir in the United Nations General Assembly should be read in the right perspective
 krishna ne kaha ki unhone jaradaari ke bhaashan kaa jawaab diya tha
 'it: Comment related to Kashmir: Look at the perspective in which it arose' The External Affairs Minister said that he did not say anything new about Kashmir in his address to the UN General Assembly
 unhone kaha, ‘bharat kaa dashakon se yahi rukh he or maine usee rukh ko doharaaya, taaki jaradaari ne mahasabha main jo kaha, us par pratikriya di ja sake
 Krishna also said that there is a need to be understood as 'something else' in relation to statements neither from his side nor from Zardari's
 yah puche jane par ki sanyukt raashtra jaise antarrashtriya manch par kashmir mudda uthne se kya sambandhon ko saamaanya banane kii disha main kiye gaye donon deshon ke prayaason par asar padegaa, krishna ne kaha, ‘ham pakistan ke saath apni vaarta jari rakhenge or rodmap taiyaar ho chukaa he tathaa ham rodmap par bane rahane kii koshish karenge or dekhte hai ki yah kis disha main badhata he

 Since then, many speculations were being made
 lekin, ravivaar subah-subah amit shah ne unase phone par baat kii or bhaajapa ke liye ‘baat’ ban gai
 That was why angry Gitanitin Patel said on Sunday that after forming the government in Gujarat, i have been given the position of Deputy CM, keeping him at number-2, but the ministry which was given to the leader of the second place was not appropriate
 unhone kaha ki mujhase vitt or shahari vikaas mantralay le liya gaya jo thik nahin he
 In this regard, Nitin had conveyed his complaint to the state CM Vijay Rupani, National President Amit Shah and Organization Minister

 Hardik said that i had messaged Nitin Kaka
 agar vah kehete hai ki unhen bijepi chhodani he to main unke saath rahoonga
 If Nitin bhai is ready to leave BJP with 10 mlas, then we will talk about giving him a suitable position in Congress

 This election is going to fight the people of the country, the voters of the country are going to contest
 unhone kaha ki janata dilli kii maujuuda satta ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye agressive ho rahi he
 Saluting the glorious land of Banaras, Modi said that the discussion of Hindustan is incomplete without the discussion of Ganga Maiya
 auron ke liye ganga ek nadi ho sakati he, lekin hamaare liye ganga maa he
 He said that Ganga is not just a stream of water, it is a stream of our culture
 nadi kii safai yojanaon main bhrashtachar kaa zikr karte hue modi ne kaha ki is ganga kii safai ke liye na jane kitni yojanaayen bani, na jane kitne rupee kharch kiye gaye, kitni cametiyaan banaai gayi, lekin pataa nahin chal rahaa he ki ganga ke andar ye rupee bhi bah ja rahe hai kya?modi ne aarope lagaae ki teen meeting ke sivaae dilli kii centre sarkaar ne or kuch nahin kiya
 He said that thousands of crores were removed from the vault of the country in the name of Ganga
 unhone centre se sawaal kiye, 'janata jawaab maangati he ki shuddhikaran ke liye aapane kya kiya, kab kiya, kis-kis ke liye kiya?'unhone kaha ki ganga ke naam par desh ke nagarikon ko murkh banaaya gaya he
 He questioned the people at the rally, whether those who committed the sin of plunder should be allowed to come back to the government again even in the sacred work like cleaning the Ganges? Modi said, "we are not people making hollow promises
 ham vaade nahin, iraade lekar aae hai
 The country is bored with promises
 desh ne upadesh bhi bahut sune hai
 Today has come the time of realizing the earth
 'modi ne kaha ki kuch log sochate hai ki hindustan kii raajnneeti main upi kaa mahatv isliye he ki upi ke bina kisi dal kii sarkaar nahin ban sakati
 This thinking is an insult to UP
 unhone sawaal kiye, 'kya upi kaa upyog sirf saansadon kaa number badhaane ke liye he? kya iskaa upyog keval sarkarein banane ke liye he?'modi ne daawa kiya ki unki soch itani simit nahin he
 He said that the question is not of the government
 yadi hindustan ko sthirataa chahie, to yah upi ke bina asambhav he
 The development of the country is not possible without the development of UP
 upi main berogari, bhukh mitaae bina hindustan kii bhukh kabhi nahin mit sakati he
 He appealed that UP should not be clubbed with just the number of mps
 upi samrudh bharat kii dharohar ban saktaa he
 Referring to Banarasi saree, Modi said that this saree is not only to save the honor of women, but also to save the economic honor of Hindustan
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kii galat nitiyon ne itane bade udyog ko barbaad karke rakh diya he
 He said that there is a big power work in Surat too
 ek samay surat main powerloom kii aawaaj zyada rahati thi, aaj puure powerloom sector ko apgrade kiya gaya he
 In fact, UP is the biggest target of Narendra Modi in Mission 2014
 varanasi kii sabha main taiyaar kiye gaye 80 foot ke manch se modi ne sirf banaras hi nahin, balki ek tarah se samooche purvanchal ke logon ko sambodhit kiya
 Modi is eyeing 14 Lok Sabha seats in this area
 modi kii varanasi raily kii khaas baat yah he ki ve sirf raily karke hi nahin lautenge
 Before the rally, Modi performed pooja at the Sankatmochan temple
 iske baad unhone baba vishwanath ke darshan kiye
 It is clear that Modi's agenda can once again be 'hinduism dissolving' in UP politics through Varanasi
 modi ke liye upi ek chunauti he, kyonki chaar rajyon ke chunaavon main jin teen rajyon main bijepi ne paracham fahraaya, vahaan modi ko 'vijay kaa senapati' kisi ne nahin mana he
 Everyone is saying that if Modi wants a prize, then he should bring a 'diamond' from the plains

 He said that due to the Kosi tragedy, sand got deposited in the affected area and the fertility of the fields was lost, the situation remains the same even today
 peedit log nitish kumaar kii baat joh rahe hai or kisi prakaar se apana jivan yaapan kar rahe hai
 After inaugurating the international seminar on Ganga on Saturday, without naming Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Nitish said in a gesture that everyone knows when the name of Ganga is taken
 When is it used? The said Ganga Maiya has called
 yah kahkar ve banaras aae
 Went away

 The people there told that Ganga Maiya, who came on the call of Ganga Maiya, is searching for Ganga Maiya
 meraa betaa kahaan gaya? He also referred to the Namami Gange scheme of the Central Government, saying that there is talk of the cleanness of the Ganges in it but there is no worry about the avidity

 unhone kaha ki unka vyaktigat taur par maananaa he ki itnaa bada network anek varshon se bihar main chal rahaa he or ye baaten mukhyamantri ke sangyaan main nahin hon, aisa ho nahin saktaa
 He said that the discussion about the involvement of ministers and mlas in power in the leak of the question paper of the examination conducted by the Bihar Staff Selection Commission should be exposed and arrest of 'big' people should be done first
 kushvaha ne har maamle main khanaapurti kiye jane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki satta main baithe logon kaa naam aane par police apana kadam peeche khinch leti he jo ki sahi nahin he
 When asked about the lack of restraint in the language of the leaders during the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election campaign, Kushwaha said that he has already believed that in politics, support for protest is a natural process but there must be a level of adherence in the language And if people go below that level then it is not right
 uttar pradesh main unki party dwaara chunaav lade jane ke bare main puche jane par kushvaha ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ke suzav par unki party ne chunaav nahin ladane kaa nirnay liya
 Referring to the foundation day of his party to be held in Delhi on March 5, he said that on the formula of Janaparik Karpoori Thakur, while granting reservation in Bihar, a separate quota for backward castes has been set, on the same lines of national level job There should be a separate classification system for backward and backward people in reservation
 tippaniyan Referring to other main issues, he said that it is necessary to constitute judicial service along with general administration and police service so that the deprived, underprivileged people, backward and over-privileged can also get proper entry into the restoration of judges and media sector There should also be a reservation system for the representation of the people of Dalit, backward and backward and underprivileged society

 This book came into the discussion before its release
 vajah
 The political incident of 2004 when Sonia Gandhi did not take the pm's chair despite the mandate
 manmohan singh ko piem bana diya
 The news also became because Priyanka and then Sonia reached out to convince Natwar, who was very close to the Gandhi family for five decades, before the release of the book
 krurta kii had tak nissangata dikhaane ko aatur natwar ne is vaakye ko bhi saarvajanik kar diya
 However, the book came out and some of its political themes were fiercely discussed in the media
 magar 'van life ij note enf' ko in tak simit kar dena galat hoga
 Some things are recorded first by reading this book

 Natwar Singh's proximity to Pandit Nehru, Indira, Rajiv and then Sonia
 unka ghanghor saahitiyik gyaan, jisaki jhalak jab tak die gaye tamaam vibhootiyon ke uddharanon se mil jaati he
 And Natwar Singh's enlightenment to find himself at the center of most great events
 bhades bhashaa main ise apane munh miyaan mitthu bananaa kehete hai

 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, votes will be cast in 71 parliamentary seats of the fourth phase on Monday, April 29
 is charan main bijepi ke saamne apane kile ko bachaane kii chunauti he jabaki congress ke saamne kuch kar dikhaane kii
 This is the reason why Prime Minister Narendra Modi is completely busy sweating the election battle
 vahiin, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi apni khoi hui siyaasi jameen ko paane ke liye din-raat ek kiye hue hai
 Voting will be held in 71 Lok Sabha seats in 9 states in the fourth phase of Lok Sabha elections
 inamen bihar kii paanch, jammu kashmir kii ek, jharkhand kii teen, madhya pradesh kii chah, maharashtra kii 17, odisha kii chah, rajasthan kii 13, uttar pradesh kii 13 or pashchim bengal kii aath siten shaamil hai
 In view of the results of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in which the 71 seats of the fourth phase are to be voted, BJP had completely eliminated the opposition
 71 main se bijepi akele dam par 45 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Whereas BJP with its allies i
e
 NDA managed to win 56 seats
 bijepi ke alaava shivasena ko 9 or algepi ko 2 siten mili thim
 At the same time, the Congress had got only 2 seats, of which Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh and Behrampur seat in West Bengal
 chhindwara se kamalnath or beharampur se adheer ranjan choudhary jeetne main kaamyaab rahe the
 Apart from Congress, Naveen Patnaik's party BJD won 6 seats
 tiemasi 6 or sapa 1 seat jiti thi
 In the challenge of saving 45 seats in front of BJP, the fourth phase is considered to be very important for BJP
 bijepi ke saamne apni 45 siton ko bachaane kii chunauti he
 Whereas Rahul Gandhi has the challenge of leading the Congress by two seats
 rajasthan kii jin 13 siton par chunaav hai, unamem congress ek bhi nahin jeet pai thi
 All these were received by BJP
 madhya pradesh kii jin 6 siton par chunaav hai, unamem congress ek seat hi jeet saki thi baaki paanch siten bijepi ko mili thim
 In such a situation, the Congress is eyeing Maharashtra along with Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 rajasthan or madhya pradesh main badali satta ne congress ko jeet kii ummid de di he
 Voting is to be held in 17 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ye sabhi 17 siten shivasena or bijepi jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Shiv Sena got 9 seats and BJP 8 seats
 congress or ensipi ko ek bhi seat nahin mili thi
 This time in the changed equation, the congress-ncp alliance is fully prepared to penetrate the fort of Shiv sena-bjp
 vahiin, jharkhand kii teen siton par chunaav hone hai, ye sabhi bijepi ke paas hai
 This time the Congress is hopeful of victory through the Grand Alliance
 uttar pradesh kii 13 siton par chauthe charan ke tahat matdaan hona he
 In 2014, BJP got 12 of these seats and SP got one seat
 is baar sapa-basapa gathbandhan se bijepi ko kadi chunauti mil rahi he
 While the Congress is also hoping to win many seats
 haalanki bijepi kii khaas najar bengal or odisha par he
 Out of the 8 seats in Bengal where elections are held, one seat was won by BJP and one by Congress
 baaki 6 siten tiemasi ke khate main gai thim
 This time the BJP is busy increasing its seats
 jabaki odisha kii jin 6 siton par chunaav ho rahe hai, ye sabhi siten bijedy ke paas hai
 BJP is trying to establish its place in Odisha
 is tarah chauthe charan ke tahat hone ja rahe matdaan main jahaan bijepi ke paas 45 siton kii ek badi sankhya ko barkaraar rakhane kii chunauti he, vahiin congress 2014 ke apane sabase bure pradarshan ko sudhaarte hue zyada se zyada siten jeetne kaa prayaas karegi

 The Madras High Court has ordered 830 websites to be blocked from the country
 aamtaur par is tarah ke order ko John Doe kaha jaataa he jise un log ke liye jari kiya jaataa he jo digital piresi kaa ulanghan karte hai
 This decision has come after the demand for ban of the producer of Balaji motion picture

 Like before, this time the court has asked Internet service providers to ban these websites
 times of india kii ek report ke mutabik flyinglett ke nirmaataa ne apnelau form lemati legal ke jariye hai court main sunwaayee karai
 Also, Internet service providers were also asked to block these websites within 24 hours
 gauratlab he ki bharat main film nirmaataa apni film relij ke samay aisa pehle se karte aae hai
 The court then blocks several websites under the John Doy order

 Former US President George W
 Bush says recalling the wreckage of the September 11 attack makes one feel like hell and when he heard of the death of Al Qaeda kingpin Osama bin Laden, he felt that a bad chapter had closed
 
 hamale ke teen din baad ground jiro ke apane daure kii yaad karte hue bush ne neshnal jeeographic channel ko die saakshaatkaar main kaha, upar se dekhne par yah aisa laga tha jaise koi bada ghaav ho lekin jab main vahaan pahunchaa to malba mujhe kisi nark se kam nahin laga
 When Al Qaeda militants attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Bush was the US President

 India has won a major victory in the international court on a petition against the sentencing of Indian citizen Kulbhushan Jadhav to be hanged in Pakistan
 hegg sthit antarrashtriya nyaayalay ne antim faisla sunaae jane tak jadhav kii faansee par roak lagaae rakhane kaa aadesh diya he
 But the question arises as to what Pakistan can do now
 kya wo jaadhv ko faansee de saktaa he? jaankaron kii maane to ab antarrashtriya court ke aadesh ke baad pakistan aisa karne se bachegaa
 Since Pakistan is a member of the UN and a member country of the International Court of Justice, it will now legally do so, with little scope
 par haa, uski jail main band kisi kaidi ke saath kya hoga, is maamle main uskaa record kharaab hi rahaa he
 Therefore, there can be no denying the possibility that Jadhav may be attacked like a Pakistani prisoner Sarabjit
 aise rukii jadhav kii faansee, padhein international court ke faisle kii har ek batakya hua tha sarbajit ke sathpakistan ne saal 1991 main lahore or faisalabad main hue bam dhamaakon ke baad sarbajit ko aatankwaad or jasusi ke iljaam main sajaa e maut di thi
 But before the sentence, in April 2013, some prisoners attacked Sarabjit and died 5 days later in the hospital
 kyon he jadhav par khatraajadhav par abhi international court kaa final vardict nahin aayaa he
 According to reports, a final decision may come on Jadhav in August
 aise main teen maah ke lambey samay main kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 These four slapses to PAK in Jadhav case in International Court
 
 
 
 Kirpal Singh also had a similar case: Indian prisoner Kirpal Singh died in Pakistan's Kot Lakhpat Jail in a suspicious condition
 pakistan ke punjab praant main bam visphoton ke aarope main court ne kirpal ko maut kii sajaa sunai gai thi, par lahore hoicourt ne kirpal ko bam visphoton ke aarope se bari kar diya tha
 After this, he died in suspicious condition
 kulbhushan ko lekar andeh ke ghere main paksaal bhar pehle pakistan main giraftaar kiye gaye kulbhushan jadhav ko pakistan kii ek military court ne maut kii sazaa sunai he, par is bare main hameshaa pakistan tathy chhipaata rahaa he
 He did not tell India for a long time whether Kulbhushan was alive or not and in which prison
 -jadhav ko aise fansaaya PAK ne, jaane is maamle main kab kya hua?-18 saal pehle bhi ICJ main bharat se cese haar chukaa he pakistan-pak ke jhooth kaa pulinda or jadhav par lagaae aaropon kii hakeekat-aise kaam karata he ICJ, 15 jajon kii team degi jadhav cese main faisla-jadhav maamle main hoga nyaay? nikam bole- bharat ne majbootee se rakhaa apana paksh- jadhav ke vakil kaa he 100 karod kaa ghar, salmaan ko 3 ghante main dilaai thi bel

 If won in this match, during Modi's election campaign, he kept silence on Kejriwal
 us vakt har kisi ke man main yahi sawaal tha ki modi aisa kyon kar rahe hai? ab pradhanmantri ne khud hi isaki vajah kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Even though Kejriwal had defeated BJP in the Delhi Assembly elections, till several months ago, the Prime Minister considered him as the leader of a small town, making a statement about which would be a waste of time
 modine bibisi kepurv patrkaar lans price se pichley saal july main yah baat kahi thi
 Price has mentioned this in his book 'the Modi Effect: Inside Narendra Modi's Companion to Transform India'

 Asked about the silence on Kejriwal during the election campaign, Modi told Price, 'my silence is my strength
 aapako yah jaananaa chahie ki bade nazariye main, kejariwal or kuch nahin balki ek shahar ke ek chota netaa hai
 He is getting more headlines than other opposition leaders
 aise main kisi kii andekhi karne main bhi samay kyon ganvaaya jaae? isliye, yah is laayak bhi nahin he ki main kejariwal ko nazarandaaj karne main apana samay gavaau
 'modi said,' To select Kejriwal to target Narendra Modi and save the Congress, a select group of media threw it at the behest of the Congress
 yah dhyaan rakhen ki vah saansad bhi nahin hai, mukhyamantri ke rup main vah keval 49 din rah paae or rashtriya mat kaa ek pratishat bhi nahin paa sake

 Where were they modi ke dilodimag main us vakt kya kuch chal rahaa tha
 Narendra Modi has also given answers to these questions
 unhone kaha, 'subah main jab voton kii ginati chal rahi thi us vakt main puri tarah akelaa tha
 i did not even have a TV set
 main dhyaan kar rahaa tha

 'all such interesting secrets have come up in this book
 modi ne ye bhi bataaya ki kaise unhen pehle hi ye ahsaas ho gaya tha ki loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan wo piem pad ke candidet ho saktaa hai
 However, he would not get the candidature so soon, it was not expected
 kitaab main modi kii prachaar niti par bhi lambii baatcheet he

 Praying Namaz has been a part of my life for me
 meri ammi-abbu ne hameshaa ghar par hi namaaj padhi, rojaanaa teen vakt fajr (subah) kii namaaj, juhr, asr (dopaher kii mili-juli) namaaj or magarib, isha (shaam kii mili-juli) kii namaaj ve apana hi sabak dekar sikhalaate the, jabaran nahin
 This was the reason why i also became a Namaji
 mujhe yaad nahin ki abbajaan ne kabhi namaaj main kotahi kii ho yaa phir kabhi namaaj padhane ke liye ve masjid gaye hon
 Ammi and the other women of the house also always offered namaz at home
 yah nijee pasand kaa maamla tha, jise maine bhi apanaaya
 Wherever i lived in the world, i always prayed in my personal realm
 yah baat 1960 ke dashak main, 1970 ke dashak main, '80 or '90 tak lagu rahi
 Let's come to Gurugram in Haryana in 2018
 (sanyog he ki haryana samet seemaa ke donon taraf ke mere parijan hameshaa ise gudgaanv hi kahenge or behad pyaar se; yah naam munh main mithaas ke saath ghul-sa jaataa he!) main ek hariyaanvi hum or ham tab se yahaan rah rahe hai jab heraat se hamaare purvaj 850 saal pehle yahaan aakar bas gaye the
 However, it is a matter of time when neither Haryana nor Punjab existed
 urdu press ke mutabik, gurugram main chah lakh se zyada musalmaan hai or unamem se zyaadaatar bihar or uttar pradesh se aae pravasi shramik hai
 On the 4th of May, members of right-wing Hindu organizations visited the six open spaces where Muslims had gathered to offer prayers and asked them to leave
 turant hi ve chhahon jagahen musalmaan shramikon or swayambhu sanyukt hindu sangharsh samiti ke bich takaraav ke maidan main badal gayi
 Police were stationed at important places to prevent violence
 phir soobe ke mukhyamantri manoharlal khatter ne britain or israel ke liye ravaanaa hone se pehle bayaan diya ki namaaj masjidon, idgahon main or nijee jagahon par padhi jaani chahie taaki logon ko asuvidha na ho
 Just before this incident, we also saw a gumti incident in Humayumpur village of Safdarjung Enclave area in Delhi
 tughlaq kaal ke ek makbare or viraasat sthal ko raturaat shiv bhole mandir main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 Until a day earlier it was a shabby historical heritage where bones of a medieval figure were buried for centuries
 agle hi din vah safed or kesaria rang se puta ek mandir ban gaya jisamen bheetar murtiyon or duusari saamagree maujuud thim
 First in 2010 and then again in 2014, the Delhi government notified it as one of the 767 heritage sites in the capital and granted Grade One status
 parisar main sthaneey parshad radhika phogot ke naam vaali do kesaria bench bhi maujuud thim
 The incident was like a slap on government orders
 puraatatv vibhaag kaa citijan charter kahata he, ''koi bhi vyakti kisi smarak ke bheetar yaa baahar yaa uski kisi bhi diwaar par na to kuch bana saktaa he, na rekhankan kar saktaa he, na paint kar saktaa he or uski moulikta ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaa saktaa he
 "these two incidents are two other ways to humiliate Muslims, degrade them and break their morale
" us ek badi sajeesh kaa hissaa jo chaar saal pehle shuru hui
 i know that such incidents have happened in earlier governments and also in the rest of the country
 lekin antar yahi he ki ab ve thik sarkaar kii naak ke neeche behad aasaani se or zyada pukhta tareeke se ho rahi hai
 The reality is that now there is neither a place of hearing nor the legal system due to which the road ahead is closed to most Muslims
 apni samoochee jindagi main maine apni rashtriyata or apane dharm, donon ko lekar baraabar garv mahasoos kiya he
 There was no confusion in my mind
 mere liye musalmaan hona bhi utana hi ahm tha jitna hindustani hona
 The first was from the demolition of the Babri Masjid, the second from the 2002 genocide in Gujarat
 pehle andhere vakt main bhi ummid kii halki roshni dikhaai detii thi par abaki baar ghatnaayen bahut zyada hai, baar-baar or khullamakhulla ho rahi hai ki koi ummid nahin chhodtin
 For those who have hated Muslims as their religion, i have nothing except my regret that they have hollowed out their own beautiful religion
 musalamaanon ke liye mere paas insaan dosti yaa inasaaniyat kaa mashvira he
 In the words of the great reformist poet of Haryana, Altaf Hussain Hali, he reminded the Muslims of the Prophet's faith: Khuda Rahm does not do that on Bashar; There should not be a pain injury that passes on one's liver to the head; Do not overshadow the sadness, please do that kind of favor on ahl-e-zamin; Khuda Meharban Hoga arsh-e-barin Parasaida Hameed is a writer-activist and lives in Delhi *** gandhi parivaar main janm lene ke baavjood khud ko sakriy raajnneeti se dur rakhane vaali priyanka gandhi wadra ab phul time politics main aa gai hai
 After getting the responsibility of the President of the Congress Party in 2018, Rahul Gandhi has decided to make his younger sister Priyanka the General Secretary of the party just before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 congress party ke is faisle ko jahaan bhartiya janata party ne parivaarwaad se jod diya he, vahiin congress kaaryakartaaon main baari josh najar aa rahaa he
 Priyanka's entry before the Lok Sabha elections is also being seen as a masterstroke
 aisa isliye bhi kyonki vah ek kushal manager, majboot campaner or behtareen architect kii bhoomika nibhaati rahi hai
 a skilled manager, 47-year-old Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been working for her family while keeping herself away from Congress activities
 khaskar maa sonia gandhi or bhai rahul gandhi ke sansadeey kshetra raibareli va amethi main unki bhoomika va sakriyata kaaphi ahm maani jaati he
 Priyanka Gandhi came to prominence in 1998 after mother Sonia Gandhi became Congress President
 1999 ke aam chunaav main sonia gandhi upi ke amethi or karnataka ke bellari seat se ek saath loksabhaa chunaav maidan main utrin
 With Sonia being in the electoral fray for two seats, Priyanka took charge of Amethi's campaign
 is chunaav ke vakt priyanka kii umr 28 saal thi or unhone apni maa ke liye jamkar chunaav prachaar kiya
 Meanwhile, Captain Satish Sharma was contesting as a Congress candidate from Rae Bareli seat in Amethi
 unke khilaaf bijepi ke arun nehru maidan main the, jinke paksh main jabardast maahaul najar aa rahaa tha
 Priyanka, on the last day of campaigning, campaigned in favor of Captain Satish Sharma and denied Arun Nehru the victory
 unhone prachaar ke dauraan bas ek hi baat kahi thi ki aap logon ne is gaddaar ko chunaav jitaayenge, jisane gandhi parivaar ko saath dhokhaa kiya he
 However, before this, she has also come to Amethi with her father Rajiv Gandhi
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main amethi seat rahul gandhi ke liye chhod di gai or sonia gandhi apni saas yani indira gandhi kii seat raibareli se chunaav ladane pahunch gayi
 In this election, Priyanka campaigned in both Amethi and Rae Bareli areas
 raibareli or amethi ko lekar priyanka gandhi kii sakriyata kaa andaja is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki abhi bhi har hafte raibareli kshetra ke log dilli aate hai or priyanka gandhi unase mulaakaat karti hai
 She frequently visits Rae Bareli
 jabaki chunaav ke vakt vahaan deraa jamaa leti hai
 For Rae Bareli and Amethi, the Congress party distributes the organization's work at the assembly and block levels under a different strategy and Priyanka Gandhi herself monitors it all
 iske alaava donon sansadeey seat par panchayat chunaav se lekar vidhansabha chunaav tak main wo tikat kaa faisla karti hai
 It is said that she herself manages to face every difficulty facing the mother and brother in the electoral fields
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main iskaa udhaaharan bhi dekhne ko mila jab modi lahar ke bich bijepi ne mashhoor tivi actress raheen smriti irani ko amethi se rahul gandhi ke khilaaf chunaav main utaar diya
 Priyanka Gandhi campaigned fiercely in Amethi to cut the rival female candidate and ensure her brother's victory
 majboot campanrpriyanka gandhi ko purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke aks ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 Like Indira Gandhi, who gave an impressive speech with a tough image and tough decision-making ability, Priyanka Gandhi is also recognized as a better speaker
 iske alaava unka style bhi apni daadi or purv piem indira kii tarah najar aata he
 Born in the largest family of the country, Priyanka Gandhi's style and tone of conversation are heard by listeners
 wo behatar dhang se hindi bol leti hai
 Even when giving speeches from the forums, she looks very comfortable
 vah bina koi script dekhe bhaashan detii hai
 He hit out at the Gujarat model for attacking Narendra Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 priyanka ne kaha gujarat model main kodiyon ke daam par hajaaron acre jameen doston ko de di gai
 Priyanka Vadra is strongly demanded for campaigning from the Congress party and leaders in the Lok Sabha to Assembly elections
 behtareen architect2017 kaa upi vidhansabha chunaav congress or samaajawaadee party ne milakar ladaa
 Although the election results were not favorable for both parties, Priyanka Gandhi's name came up behind the alliance between Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav
 media reports main yah baat saamne ain ki rahul gandhi, priyanka gandhi or prashanth kishor kii meeting main priyanka ne sapa se gathbandhan ko jaruri bataaya tha
