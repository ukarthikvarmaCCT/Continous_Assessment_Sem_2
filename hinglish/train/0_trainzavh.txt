 banaras seat par bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi ke khilaaf chunaav ladanaa chaahati thim priyanka gandhi lekin unki hi party congress peeche hat gai
 If sources are to be believed, Priyanka was willing to take on Modi, but on one occasion the Congress high command decided not to field her in electoral politics
 ab tak apane bhai rahul or maa sonia gandhi ke sansadeey kshetra amethi va raibareli tak simit rahane vaali priyanka kaa maananaa tha ki desh ke liye narendra modi ko rokna hoga
 It was speculated that Priyanka's election could have limited Modi's stormy campaigning across the country
 iske alaava yah faisla party kaaryakartaaon or samarthakon main jaan foonkane kaam karata wo bhi tab jab kai senior netaa haar ke dar se chunavi samar main utarane se hichkicha rahe hai
 a party manager said that even if she had lost the election, the results would have been declared on May 16 itself
 lekin yah faisla kaaryakartaaon ko utsahit karata
 It would have been a very bold decision
 varisht congressi netaa ne bataaya ki modi ke khilaaf party varanasi se kisi bahari kii jagah sthaneey netaa ho chunaav ladvana chaahati thi
 However, there can be many other reasons behind this decision
 agar priyanka varanasi se chunaav ladatin to narendra modi ko jarurat se zyada tavajjo milti
 In addition, one of the three members of the Gandhi family would be in danger of defeat
 vahiin robert wadra se jude vivaadon ko priyanka par siyaasi hamale tej ho jate
 Most importantly, it would have raised questions on Rahul Gandhi's leadership
 janata ke bich yah sandesh jaataa ki rahul kaaryakartaaon main utsaah bharne main naakaam rahe hai
 Probably for this reason, Priyanka has been fielded now

 kariyar point jaise kuch santhaan to faikalti ke liye bhi pravesh pariksha rakhte hai
 Here the salary of teachers is so high that people leave good jobs in corporate world and start teaching
 masalan, saransh gupta ko lijie jinhen 2006 ke iity-jeii main 41waan sthaan hasil hua tha
 After graduating from iit-mumbai in 2010, he got a job at Goldman Sachs but after three years, he quit the job and moved to Kota and started teaching physics at Allen Career Institute

 The competition among coaching institutes is so fast that there are many incidents of drawing each other's faculty between them
 alan kaa daawa he ki haal ke varshon main usne teen baar bansal classes kii lagbhag puri faikalti ko todakar apane yahaan le liya he
 Different batches have different names like Bulls Eye (11th class student), Nucleus (class XII), Stirling (student of class 13) ie students who failed to get an IIT for the first time; they are also called repeaters

 daakhile ke samay saare chaatr ek hi str se padhai shuru karte hai
 After this, review tests are taken and the students are divided into different batches based on their performance
 baichon ke naam e0, e1, e2, e3, e4, bi1, bi2, bi3 ityadi hote hai
 The method of teaching varies in all batches
 masalan, e0 batch ke kisi chaatr ko bahut sahare kii jarurat nahin hoti kyonki vah ghar par abhyaas kar saktaa he, par isse neeche ke batch ke chaatro ko zyada maargdarshan kii jarurat hoti he
 This review test is done every 45 days, the result of which is sent to the parents and they are also talked about
 padhaane ke tareeke bhi lagaataar viksit ho rahe hai
 For example, Allen has an online platform for students called CSAT (systematic Analysis of Tests for Classroom Students)
 yah bacchon ke pradarshan kaa ek vistrut vishleshan hota he jise unke mata-pita bhi dekh sakate hai
 It consists of a report based on individual questions and a section where the student's marks are compared with the toppers
 ab to google plastor par iske liye android ap bhi aa chuki he
 Its tagline says- "to me is not enough, you must hit" (just shooting is not enough & must be targeted)
 faikalti jin chaatro ko sambhavit topper maanati he, unke liye nijee str par maargdarshan is shikshan kii kunjee he

 jis subah hamane unase mulaakaat kii, ve ek aisi ladki ke liye physics ke nots bana rahe the, jiske bare main unka maananaa he ki vah unke santhaan se iity top karne vaali pehali ladki ban sakati he
 This 17 year old girl named Mayanka Medhe is from Navi Mumbai
 mayanka par vishesh dhyaan diya janaa usee batch ke 17 varshiya chaatr akaash arun gupta ke liye thik nahin he
 For the last one and a half years, Gupta was in the first place continuously but in the last two rts, Mayanka took his place
 jab haalia arti kaa score aayaa to uski maa rajani gupta nagpur se ek din baad hi uske saath rahane ke liye yahaan chali ain
 She will provide all possible help to her son by staying in the residential complex here
 akaash kaa din subah 6 baje shuru hota he
 He studies in his room until one o'clock in the night with two classes, doubt-solving sessions and lunch breaks in between
 usne kota aane ke baad se ek bhi film nahin dekhi he or soshal media se bhi dur rahata he
 He explains, "I saw the last film in 2013
 ” uski maa apane saath mewa lekar ai he jo uski teble par rakhe hai
 Periodic table chart is placed on the wall
 uskaa sapana iity-jeii main top 10 main aana he
 What helps with living with a mother? Akash says, "I am scared
 agar main naakaam rahaa to? maa saath main he to main doston ke saath yaa mess haul main kam samay bitaata hum
 “aakash studies here at cbse-affiliated Bansal Public School but does not go there like hundreds of other students, focusing only on his coaching classes
 kota main aise dami skool kukuramute kii tarah ug aae hai
 We are family
 The basic mantra of these institutions is "catch them young" (catch them at a young age)
 kariyar point ne kota ke thegda main 2012 main sibiesai se sambhddha chhathvin se barahavin class kaa ek awasaiya skool kariyar point gurukul shuru kiya tha
 The school claims that its entire focus is on various competitive exams like Olympiad, National Talent Search Exam, IIT-JEE, pre-medical etc
 sawaal uthta he ki skool main padhgaye vaale bacchon ke liye koching kii jarurat hi kyon ho? iske administrator madhukar gupta kehete hai, “ham sahi samay par sahi neenv daal rahe hai
 "currently 800 children are registered in this school
 campus main apartment bane hue hai jahaan parivaar apane bacchon ke saath rah sakate hai
 This March, Archana Gaur has moved her two daughters from Goa to an apartment named Matruchaya
 ek beti mahak gaur naveen main he or duusari sheril gaur saatvin main he
 She says, "everyone studies here
 yah prerana dene vaala maahaul he
 On the second floor is the Baghel family from Sagar in Madhya Pradesh
 jab ham yahaan pahunche to gurukul main barahavin kaa chaatr shivaansh baghel padhai main juta hua tha or uske bistar par kitaaben bikhri padi thim
 His younger brother Shashwat, who studies in eighth, was in school at the time
 inaki maa pratibha baghel samay kaat rahi thim
 In the meantime, Bai of his house brought water to everyone
 pratibha kahati hai, “maine bacchon kii khatir apana shahar chhod diya he
 "she takes full care that her children do not face any difficulty in eating and drinking
 dilachasp or gaur karne laayak baat yah he ki inke apartment main aisi koi cheez nahin he jisase bacchon kaa dhyaan bhatak jaae
 There is neither TV nor computer, nor laptop nor smartphone
 yahaan soshal media tak koi bhi pahunch nahin he
 Concentrating inspirations The core mantra of Kota is concentration
 yahaan bachche biimaar padana bhi gavaara nahin kar sakate
 These coaching institutes argue that the existing syllabus of classes 11 and 12 is not sufficient to clear the examinations
 bansal classes main kaarobaar vistaar kaa kaam dekhne vaale modali venkat harikrishnan kehete hai, “sirf skool main janaa or ensiiarti kii kitaaben padhuya kaaphi nahin he
 ”pramod Maheshwari also agrees, having studied at IIT Delhi himself and who started Career Point in 1993
 ve kehete hai, “ham yahaan isliye hai, kyonki desh main schuli shiksha kii haalat kharaab he
 He does not deserve competitive exams
 ”jab utsaah chukne lagata he to ye santhaan prerak vaktaaon or guruon ko vyaakhyaan dene ke liye bula lete hai
 Alan has introduced a new way of monitoring children: students are given a diary in which they have to record their daily work
 diary kaa naam he “meraa sach” or usamen kuch sawaal hai, jaise “kya main suryoday se pehle jaagaa tha?”, “kya maine apane niyamit kaam, varjish or prarthana samay par puri kii?” “kya maine apane mata-pita, sangrakshakon or kariyar ke lakshya ko yaad kiya?”, “kya maine puri tarah santulit or poshak aahaar liya?” ityadi
 Inspiration is scattered everywhere, for example, on the board of Career Point, it is written, "if you can dream, you can also fulfill it
 ” 2015 ke iity topper satvat jagavaani ko garv se banslite qaraar dete hue uske bare main board par likhaa he, “jab pratibha mehnat se chook jaae to mehnat pratibha ko haraa sakati he
 "sometimes it happens that this burden of pressure, atmosphere and expectations breaks the students
 june main paanch chaatro kii khudakushi kii ghatana se kota hill gaya tha, haalanki police kaa daawa he ki padhai ke dabaav se sirf ek maut hui he
 Maheshwari says, "we set expectations but the question is whether we are able to pay attention to those aspirations?" The atmosphere is still the same
 uttar pradesh ke gajipur se aae 18 saal ke saumy kumaar ko ganit se dar lagata he
 17-year-old Preeti Kumari from Haryana does not like the food here because “it does not contain much ghee
 ” jamshedpur se ai 18 saal kii sristi sharma pehali baar main iity nahin nikaal pain to dobaaraa koshish kar rahi hai
 She says, "I have promised my parents, i have to work very hard
" ” haryana kii 17 varshiya jyoti jakhad apni padhai main itani mashgool hai ki chaar din se unhone kapade hi nahin badale
 They are all dreaming of going to IIT
 thik un 14 lakh anya chaatro kii tarah jo har saal iity kii pariksha dete hai
 The question is, how many of these will succeed and how many dreams will be broken? dilli police kii special cell ne do shaatir drugs taskaron ko giraftaar kiya he, jinke paas se teen kilo heroin baraamad kii gai he
 The heroin price has been estimated at Rs 12 crore in the international market
 pakade gaye taskaron ke taar myanmar se jude hai
 Police had received information from secret sources that a large consignment of Kidrugs is coming to Delhi
 ye khabar milte hi special cell kii team harakat main aa gai
 The police then laid their trap and arrested two smugglers from Mahipalpur area of delhi
 jinaki pahchaan niraj gupta or hafizuddin ke rup main hui he
 During interrogation, the police came to know that this large consignment of drugs came from Manipur, which Hafizuddin had brought
 yah khep niraj gupta ko supplai kii jaani thi
 Neeraj used to take the drugs further to other people in Delhi, UP and Punjab
 jaanch main pataa chalaa ki karodon kii yeheroinamyanmar se manipur pahunchi thi
 From there Hafizuddin brought it to Delhi
 vah pichley kai saalon se drugs ke dhandhe main shaamil he
 He used to come to Delhi with flights from Manipur
 lekin kabhi pakadaa nahin gaya
 According to the information, he used to wrap vicious heroin in carbon
 carbon main rap karne ke baad drugs kabhi bhi scinar main dikhaai nahin detii thi
 Similarly, he used to come to Delhi easily with drugs
 dilli main drugs baramadagi kaa yah koi pehla maamla nahin he
 In the same week, the special cell had recovered a drug party of Rs 50 crore, meow meow and hashish worth Rs 55 lakh
 ab police is puure racket kii chaanbin kar rahi he
 The extent of police negligence in Delhi was reached
 car chori hone ke baad thane main shikaayat lekar gaye ek peedit se police ne kaha ki khud hi dhund lo apni car
 The GPS must have been installed
 iske baad peedit ne khud apni car trek kii or noida se use le bhi aae
 The matter is related to Bharat Nagar police station in Delhi
 jahaan peedit jitendra apnikar chori kii shikayatalekar gaye the
 The policemen there told them to find their own car, they must have installed GPS in it
 police kii naseehat sunakar jitendra hairaan pareshaan waapas laut aae
 After this Jitendra tried to track the GPS
 aakhir unhone jeepies se pataa laga liya ki unki car noida ke rampura ilaake main khadi he
 Jitendra again reached the spot himself and brought back his Eco car from there
 ye akele jitendra kaa maamla nahin he
 Car theft is very common in this area
 logon ne kai sisitivi camere bhi lagava rakhe hai, lekin chor phir bhi nahin darate, or chor daren bhi kyon jab police unhen pakadaney kii jahamat hi nahin uthaati
 This attitude of Delhi Police is really shameful
 jab koi police ke paas shikaayat lekar jaataa he, to police unase yahi puuchhati he ki car main jeepies laga rakhaa he ki nahin, agar laga rakhaa he to khud hi dhund lo or nahin to phir dekho kismat hogi to mil jaaegi

 If you love someone, then you must express your love in different ways
 kai baar kuch aisa ho jaataa hoga, jisase aapke yaadgaar pal kadavaahat bhare palon main badal jate honge
 For example, when two people are in love, whom do they express their love towards each other
 par kai baar kuch aisa ho jaataa he kigin palon ko aap kis karke yaadgaar banane kii soch rahe hote hai voapke liye kadavi yaad banakar rah jate hai
 Kissing a partner is a way of expressing love, but during this time you should avoid doing anything that makes your partner feel bad
 agar aap ye soch rahe hai ki aisa kuch kya ho saktaa he to yahaan kuch aisi hi baton kaa zikr he:1
 Is this smell coming from you? If you are going to kiss your partner, then never ask him if there is any smell from him
 2
 Never compare your kiss to your partner, never question whether his or her ex-boyfriend used to do it in the same way
 ye sawaal aapke partner ko bilkul bhi pasand nahin aayega
 3
 dakaar lenaagar aapako dakaar jaisaa mahasoos ho rahaa he to behatar hoga ki aap pehle hi dakaar le len or uske baad kis karen
 4
 main mood main nahin hunkis karne se pehle partner se kahana ki aapkaa mood nahin he lekin tumhaari khushi ke liye main tumhen kis karuunga, bahut galat hoga
 5
 maine tumhe kabhi us najar se dekha nahinapako uske saath ghoomana, phirana pasand he lekin jab wo aapse kis karne ke liye kahati he to aap use ye kahkar manaa kar dete hai ki aapane use kabhi us nazariye se nahin dekha
 He is just a good friend for you
 aisa kahana na to use acha lagegaa or na hi aapke shobhaa degaa

 Used to take me to the dock every day for practice, my practice also became their workout, people say, illuminate the father's name, but illuminate the mother's name for me Minister equally important

 As a child, when Ajinkya Rahane went to practice, his mother used to pick up his kitbag and drop it, and after practice came back home with the kitbag
 unke paas itane paise bhi nahin the ki vah auto main ja saken
 On the other hand, his mother's contribution is somewhere behind Dhoni's success

 After Modi, the Amuslim Brotherhood in power wanted complete control over the country

 (from input ANI) (input ANI se) Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has admitted that his country's intelligence agency ISI has links with terrorist commanders such as Sirajuddin Haqqani, the suspect in the attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul
 musharraf ne ek saakshaatkaar main yah bhi mana ki iesai ne afghanistan main pakistan ke rajdoot kii mukti ke liye hakkaani ke prabhaavon kaa istemaal kiya tha jinhen batulla mahsood ke aatankwaadi sanghathan taharik-e-taliban ne apharan kar bandhak bana liya tha
 The former Pakistani President said that Haqqani, as we know today, is a person whose influence is on the dreaded terrorist Baitullah Mehsud who is the most feared commander of South Waziristan and the killer of Benazir Bhutto
 musharraf ne kaha ki mahsood ne kabul main hamaare rajdoot kaa apharan kiya or hamaari khufia agency ne unki rihaai ke liye hakkaani ke prabhaav kaa upyog kiya
 However, he said that this does not mean that we advocate Haqqani
 khufia seva kuch khaas dushmano ko kuch duusare dushmano ke khilaaf istemaal karti he
 And it is better to deal with one after the other than to make everyone an enemy together
 pakistani raashtrapati se jab america media kii in reporton ke bare main poocha gaya ki jisamen kaha gaya he ki iesai ne suniyojit rup se taliban kii himaayat kii to musharraf ne kaha khufia agenciyon kii hameshaa anya network tak pahunch hoti he
 This is what Americans do to the KGB, and this is what ISI does
 ullekhneey he ki sirajuddin hakkaani mashhoor mujahidin commander jilaluddin hakkaani kaa betaa he jo afgaan taliban kaa sarvocch commander he
 Musharraf raised a finger on RAW, accused of being the mastermind of the attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul on 7 July 2008
 apane saakshaatkaar ke kram main musharraf ne bhartiya khufia agency ro par swat ghati main hastkshep karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 He also alleged that the Indian intelligence agency was giving weapons to the Baloch rebels and financing them
 purv pakistani raashtrapati ne yah bhi kaha ki anek bhartiya ugravadi hai jo pakistan main ugravadi hai
 Musharraf claimed that if the world is serious about tackling terrorism, then they should not leave India because there is an Indian element behind the current situation in Pakistan

 According to the information, he had not received any threat in the last two years

 pakistan or srilanka ne isisi vishwa cap-2019 kii jis tarah se shuruyaat kii thi, usase laga nahin tha ki yah timen kuch khaas kar paaengi, lekin apane duusare match main hi in donon tiimon ne vijayi path par vaapasi kii or bataaya ki pradarshan main sudhaar kisi bhi vakt ho saktaa he
 Now the two teams will face each other on the county ground here, with the same challenge, to maintain the winning order
 pakistan ko pehle match main westeindies ne 105 ranon par dher kar diya tha, lekin duusare match main 1992 kii vijeta team ne is vishwa cap kii sabase majboot daavedaar or mejabaan team england ko maat de sabhi ko hairaan kar diya
 In this match, Pakistan had 348 runs on the board and won by 14 runs
 srilanka ko newjiland ne pehle match main 136 ranon par samet diya tha
 In the second match, Sri Lanka faced hidden Rustom Afghanistan
 lag rahaa tha ki majboot gendbaaji vaali afghanistan is match main srilanka ko patake degi lekin 1996 kii vijeta ne 34 ranon se match apane naam kar jeet ke raste par vaapasi kii
 The strength of both teams has increased and now both teams do not want to lose it
 yah match donon tiimon ke liye pariksha se kam nahin he
 Looking at the performance of the previous match, Pakistan has an upper hand in this match because the way Pakistan returned with bat and ball makes it a strong contender for victory in this match
 england ke khilaaf pakistan kii team main jo anbhavi khilaadi hai unhone apni ahmiyat dikhaai
 For example, Mohammad Hafeez, known as Professor and Babar Azam, considered the best batsman of the team, besides captain Sarfaraz Ahmed played half-century innings
 vahiin fakhar jamaan or imam ul haq kii salaami jodi ne team ko majboot shuruyaat di thi
 England were still ahead of Pakistan in the match and when the match seemed to be going towards them, the team had the most experienced bowlers Wahab Riaz and Mohammad Amir put a spell that snatched the match from England
 anbhavi khilaadiyon kaa hona pakistan ke liye sarplus he jo srilanka ke paas nahin he
 Angelo Mathews is an experienced player by taking it to Sri Lanka but no one knows what happened to him at this time
 balla or gend donon maithyuj se maano ruthe baithe hai
 Kushal Perera scored the highest score of 78 runs in the last match
 unke alaava koi or ballebaaj badi pari nahin khel sakegaa
 His bowling was won by Sri Lanka
 nuwan pradeep ne ahm samay par chaar wicket lekar afghanistan ko haar ke liye vivash kar diya tha
 But Sri Lanka will have to take their game level further against Pakistan

 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has sent a legal notice of defamation to Congress leader Digvijay Singh
 digvijay ne esare maamle main fadanvis par bhai-bhatijawad kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Advocate Ganesh Sovani said that on behalf of Fadnavis, he has sent a notice to Digvijay Singh regarding defamatory tweets against the CM
 patni ke bank ko phayda pahunchane kaa aaropabata den ki beete dinon congress ke varisht netaa digvijaisingh ne apane twit main kaha, 'maharashtra ke mukhyamantri kii adhyakshata vaale mumbai ke esare ne aadhikarik taur par sabhi esare developers ko kaha he ki ve exis bank kii varali shakha main apana bank khaataa kholen
 Do you know why? Mrs
 Fadnavis is the Vice President of Axis Bank
 nijee bank exis bank ko phayda pahunchane ke liye
 The culmination of nepotism
 SRA in Mumbai headed by CM of Maharashtra has officially asked all SRA developers to open accounts only in Worli branch of Axis Bank
 - digvijaya singh (@ digvijaya_28) March 18, 2016 Do you know why? Mrs Fadnavis is the Vice President of Axis Bank! a windfall for the Axis Bank a private bank
 Height of Nepotism !— digvijaya singh (@digvijaya_28)march 18, 2016dilachasp baat yah he ki siem fadanvis ne haal hi is maamle par spashtikaran bhi diya, jiske baavjood digvijay ye twit kiye
 Significantly, the Fadnavis-led Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) issued an order on 10 February directing the developers to pay the qualifying slum dwellers on or before 15 February 2016 in South Mumbai Hand over your bank account details to the Worli branch of Axis Bank
 mukhyamantri ne diya tha spashtikaranmaamala saamne aane ke baad fadanvis ne spashtikaran main kaha tha ki kisi bhi tarah ke niyam kaa ulanghan nahin kiya gaya he or is faisle kaa unki patni se koi lenaa-dena nahin he, jo bank main adhikari hai
 The SRA order said that if the developers failed to hand over the details to the private bank branch, they would be fined up to Rs five lakh
 sansad kaa puraa satr is baar pruthak telugana mudde kii bhent chadh gaya
 Moreover, for the first time in the history of India, the Rail Budget could not be read in the Lok Sabha
 antarim bajet pesh kiye jane ke dauraan bhi itnaa shor-sharaaba rahaa ki bahut-si baaten sunai nahin padin
 Everyday commotion and disruption of functioning
 donon hi paksh apni-apni maangon par ade rahe or sansad main bamushkil andhra pradesh ke vibhaajan kaa bill rakhaa ja sakaa
 The bill had 34 amendments and could be introduced only after considerable effort
 zaahir he ki isamen bijepi kii baat maan lee gai he or yah bill paarit ho gaya
 After this, the paper process of division of Andhra Pradesh will be completed
 lekin baar-baar sawaal yah uthegaa ki aakhir congress ne is mudde ko itane aparipakv dhang se nipataane kii kaise koshish kii
 Now how did the issue of Telangana become the object of his life? The simple reason is that the party neither showed foresight nor did it take practical steps
 itnaa hi nahin, usne is mudde kaa chunaav main laabh uthaane kaa man banaaya, jiske hi kaaran 15veen loksabhaa ke antim dinon main itnaa shor-sharaaba hua ki sadan chalane kii sthiti main nahin rahaa
 Never seen so much chaos
 kuch saansadon ne to sadan main gundon kii tarah vyavhaar kiya or jitna sambhav hua, utani araajaktaa failaai
 The dignity of the House was deeply hurt
 congress ne 1999 main rajya ke vibhaajan kii khuli maang kii thi or is mudde ko usne khud hi aanch di thi, lekin baad main vah isse dur hone lagi
 The party took political advantage of the issue at that time, but later it also tried to suppress the separate Telangana case
 natijatan maamla pechida hota gaya or seemandhra ke log jo ab tak tamaasha dekh rahe the, apane rajya ko na bantane dene ke liye is andolan main kud pade
 a chaotic movement was born from here, in which mlas, mps and even ministers jumped
 yah aisa maamla tha ki jisane congress ko bahut chot pahunchaai or iske dushprinaam vah loksabhaa chunaav main bhugtegi
 The bill to bifurcate Andhra Pradesh has got the approval of the Lok Sabha with the support of the BJP, but the question will remain that why did the Congress dragged the matter so much? Why did party warlords let it go so far that a state of chaos arose? Why did she repeatedly run away from the issue she raised herself? sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) kii adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne 9 march ko mumbai main india today conklev main garajte hue kaha, "ham 2019 main bhaajapa ko satta main nahin aane denge
 "opponents found it to be overconfident, especially at a time when their party has remained in power in just three states and one union territory
" pradhanmantri narendra modi aaj bhi raajnneetik falak par sabase karishmai siyaasi netaa bane hue hai or isamen us beraham chunaav mashin ko bhi jod len jo bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne khadi kii he, to is jodi ne pichley chaar saal main 12 nae rajya fatah kiye hai
 He has waved his foot in the new frontiers — Jammu and Kashmir, Assam and Tripura
 isse ulat congress manipur, goa or meghalaya main sabase badi party ke taur par ubharne ke baavjood sarkaar nahin bana saki
 It is not just the Congress that is feeling threatened by the ever-growing and expanding BJP — which is now in power in 21 states — but also many other regional forces, such as the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal
 There are two to four
 vajood kaayam rakhane kii ghor hataasha hi he jisane kattar pratidwandviyon ko bhi bemail gathbandhanon kii taraf dhakela he
 Sonia made this claim at a time when intense political events have occurred one after the first three months of the last decisive year before the 2019 elections
 janvari main rashtriya loktantric gathbandhan (endie) kii sahyogi shivasena ne elaan kiya ki vah 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav akele ladegi
 Two months later, another ally of his Telugu Desam Party (TDP) severed ties with the NDA
 yahi nahin, bhaajapa rajasthan, madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh or bihar ke upachunaav bhi haar gai
 The party could barely win in a tough contest against Congress in Prime Minister Modi's home state of Gujarat in December, before defeating nine in 10 Lok Sabha by-elections after 2014
 sabase zyada pratikatmak or jhannatedaar paraajay kaa munh use uttar pradesh main dekhnaa padaa
 The staunch opposition SP and BSP joined hands to blow up the BJP in the bypolls in Gorakhpur and Phulpur seats, vacated by the resignations of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya
 is hakeekat ne naatakeeyata ko or bhi badha diya ki bhaajapa 1989 se gorakhpur seat kabhi nahin haari thi
 This success, seemingly impossible between political enemies Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati, fueled the discussion of an alliance against the BJP — and also in the political multiplicity that Sonia and West Bengal Chief Ministers have been trying to overcome for over a year
 She was beautiful for a long time
 yah digar baat he ki donon kii mahatvakankshaayen ekadam alag hai
 The chewing of figures has already started
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr saamana main ise swar diya
 Criticizing the BJP for the defeat of Gorakhpur and Phulpur, he warned in an editorial, "in 2019, BJP seats will not be 280 and now it is clear that there will be a reduction of at least 100 to 110 seats
 ''mamata ke bharosemand sipahasaalar or tiemasi ke rajyasabha saansad derek obrayan ne bhavishyavaanee kii, "rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or haryana main, jahaan se abhi bhaajapa ke paas 69 siten hai, uski siten ghatakar 20 se neeche aa jaaengi
 "there is no ideal way of electoral speculation and multiplication
 haalanki 2014 main bhaajapa ne apane dam par bahumat hasil kiya tha (loksabhaa kii kul 543 siton main 282 siten jitkar), par uski vot hissedari mahaj 31 fisadi hi thi
 No party had ever won so many seats with such a low vote share; Before any one party with the lowest vote share had won a majority, it was the Congress in 1967, when it won 40 of the total votes cast
 8 fisadi ke saath 28 3 siten jiti thim
 More interestingly, the combined vote share of BJP and Congress was just over 50 per cent, which means that half the votes were for another party
 agar do bade gathbandhanon kii kul sanyukt vot share ko liya jaae to endie ko 38
 5 per cent while the UPA received just under 23 per cent of the votes
 iske baad bhi kul takreeban 39 fisadi vot—mote taur par endie kii vot hissedari ke baraabar—anya partiyon kii jholii main gaye the
 So the coming of UPA and other parties on paper can stop Modi's huge convoy in 2019
 yahi nahin, 2014 main bhaajapa kii 31 fisadi vot hissedari paanch rajyon (gujarat, himachal pradesh, madhya pradesh, rajasthan or uttarakhand) main use mili 50 fisadi voton kaa or anya chaar rajyon main use mili 40 fisadi se zyada voton kaa nateeja thi
 Now that the two big allies have deserted him and there is little chance of repeating the tremendous performance in these nine states getting more than 40 per cent of the votes, things look difficult for the modi-shah duo
 siton ke lihaaj se 2014 ke nateezon kaa ek vishleshan 10 rajyon main faili 304 siton par party kii mushkilon ko ujagar karata he
 These are the states where the party will be fighting alone against many opposition parties (see Opposition mathematics)
 paanch saal pehle, jab vipaksh bikharaa hua tha, usne in 304 siton main se 140 siten jiti thim
 Of these, 71 seats (out of total 80) were in Uttar Pradesh alone
 agar sapa or basapa 2014 main saath milakar ladi hotin, to ve uttar pradesh main bhaajapa kii siton ko 30 se bhi neeche le aatin
 Congress media in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala says, "the results of Gorakhpur and Phulpur themselves tell what is going to happen for BJP ahead
 ''sahyogi bhaajapa ko bachaa paaenge?2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main chaar rajyon main jahaan bhaajapa sahyogiyon ke saath ladi vahaan sanyukt vipaksh kii takat kii ek padtaal
 BJP won 29 out of 100 seats in these states
 saath hi iske baad hue vidhansabha chunaav main vot shift hone kii tasviir
 Apart from this, BJP will face opposition parties along with one or more allies in other 100 seats in four states
 2014 main usne inamen se 29 siten jiti thim
 Of these, Bihar had 22 out of 40 seats, in that state, which it lost in 2015 to the joint opposition of RJD, Janata Dal (united) and Congress
 do saal baad jad(you) ke mukhiya or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne paala badla or bhaajapa ke kheme main aa gaye, haalanki is dosti main bhi ab tanaav jhalkane laga he
 After the defeat of the BJP-JD (U) alliance in the by-elections for Araria Lok Sabha seat and Jehanabad assembly seat, Nitish Kumar said that his party decided to enter these bouts due to heavy pressure from the BJP
 unhone kaha, "bhaajapa kii jabardast maang par party ne sochaa ki agar hamane unki baat nahin maani to dosha hamaare upar hi aayega
 We obeyed him very well knowing what was going to happen
 ''dilli ke jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main raajnneeti vigyaan padhaane vaale professor dwaipayan bhattacharya ke mutabik, 2019 main muqabla rajya ke apane khaas asantosh-naaraazgi or rajyon ke prati "asamvedansheel'' kendriya bhaajapa ke bich hoga

 Many leaders want to take credit for not uniting the opposition against the glut of faces

 They will form unlikely alliances, the example of which is the SP-BSP
 bhaajapa virdohi vot ranneetik tareeke se chunaav lard rahi sabase majboot party ko chale jaaenge
 The decisive battle, however, will take place in 100 seats in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, where there will be a direct contest between the BJP and the Congress
 2014 main bhaajapa ne inamen se 97 siten jiti thim
 BJP insiders also privately believe that it would be impossible to repeat it given the trend of by-elections in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 pichley do saal main congress ne rajasthan or madhya pradesh main loksabhaa (2) or vidhansabha (6) ke sabhi upachunaav jite hai
 Says Bhattacharya, "together the united opposition and the improvement in the condition of the Congress in the three big states will ensure that the BJP does not cross 200
" ''pachmail gathbandhan?haalanki aankade bhaajapa kii mushkil kaa ishaara kar rahe hai, par siyasat mahaj guna-bhaag se kahin zyada he
 It also means a lot of chemistry and at the moment there is no single leader who can unite the scattered opposition
 chunavi ganit bhi hameshaa kamyaabi kii guarantee nahin detaa, jaise rajd-jad(you) congress mahagathbandhan 2015 main bihar main bhaajapa ko satta se dur rakhane main kaamyaab rahaa, par sapa-congress kaa gathbandhan akhilesh or rahul kii yuva aguai ke saath pichley saal uttar pradesh main vaisaa jaadui nateeja dene main naakaam rahaa
 In 2016, the Left parties and the Congress alliance in West Bengal looked strong on paper, but could not prevent the TMC from winning a landslide in the elections
 jeenyu main rajnatik vigyaan ke professor pralay kanoongo kehete hai, "chunaavon kaa matlab keval jod or ghataav hi nahin he
 Elections are still a year away and the results will be decided by the burning issues of the time

 "if there is one election which will decide the direction of the whole year till 2019, then it is Karnataka election
" agar congress is soobe ko apni jholii main rakh paati he, to yah rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh ke agle teen bade chunaavon ke liye party main nai jaan phoonk degaa
 But bjp's victory will put a big question mark on Rahul Gandhi's leadership ability
 rajnatik vishleshak rahul verma or pranav gupta apane ek web kollam main likhte hai, "samaan chunavi sambhaavnaaon vaali kai kshetreey partiyon ke gathbandhan main kai saare vito khilaadi honge
 The Congress is the only possible candidate, but after 2014 it has failed to find a way to independently rejuvenate itself
 jab tak vah karnataka nahin jitati or madhya pradesh yaa rajasthan sareekha bada rajya fatah nahin karti, tab tak uske sarvamaanya party ke taur par ubharne kii sambhaavnaaen dhulmul rahengi
 "both these authors also warn about the very meaning of the results of the by-elections
 unhone 1967 or 2012 ke bich hue 1,100 vidhansabha or 213 loksabhaa upachunaavon ke nateezon kaa adhyayan kiya or paaya ki rashtriya str par sattarum party kii bajaae in siton par rajya kii sattarudh party ke jeetne kii sambhaavna zyada thi
 He also matched the results of the by-elections held within two years of the assembly elections with the state-level election results and found that the winning party of the by-election is less than half as likely to win the next assembly election
 aakhir main ve is nattejey par pahunchate hai, "in do prakaar ke nateezon kaa nishkarsh saaf he—sthaneey str ke mudde or raftaar upachunaav ke nattejey tay karti he or unase puure rajya kaa yaa rashtriya rujhaan milane kaa koi saboot nahin he
 The lack of a common ground of ideology is also another reason for the disintegration of such alliances
 kai siyaasi jaankaar daleel dete hai ki aaj kaa aakankshaon se labalab yuva matadaata 1990 ke dashak kii antarkalah se grast "tisare morche'' kii sarkaron ko bardaashat karne ke liye taiyaar nahin bhi ho saktaa he or iske bajaae modi kii "majboot-nirnaayak'' aguai ko chun saktaa he
 Professor Bhattacharya believes that Modi's image of being a karmayogi has received a tremendous blow and now he will be tested on the basis of the functioning of BJP governments at the Center and in the states
 ve kehete hai, "bhaajapa ne modi-shah kii jodi ke maatahat khud ko bahut zyada kendriyakrut kar liya he

 "mamata vs Rahul
 The crisis of existence and the same aspirations to stop modi-shah can unite the opposition parties but there is no consensus that if all the opposition parties have a common front, then Who will lead it? chunki congress rashtriya party he or puure desh main maujuudagi rakhti he isliye alag-alag mizaaj vaale dalon ko ek saath jodakar rakhane ke liye vah ek swaabhaavik vikalp ho sakati he par mamata banerjee kii mahatvakankshaayen, rahul ko modi kaa vikalp banakar ubharne main aade aa sakati hai
 Although the Trinamool has only 14 mps against the Congress mps in the Lok Sabha, Mamata has laid such a position that for the last four years her own party has been seen as the main opposition party, both outside Parliament and outside Parliament

 a young Congress general secretary says, "let us not forget that behind the possible alliance between Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav in the Bihar assembly elections, Rahul Gandhi had a big hand
 ''party ke andruni sutron ke mutabik, rahul gandhi kaa nirdesh saral he—2019 kaa hamaara lakshya jeetne kaa nahin he, balki modi ko satta se hataane kaa he
 The newly elected Congress president understands that within a year it is impossible to get the party ready to fight in the states where she has been reduced to a modest player
 isliye un rajyon main vah kshetreey dalon ko ekajute karne ke prayaas karegi jabaki karnataka, kerala, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan, gujarat, haryana or uttarakhand main apane dam par chunaav ladegi

 In fact, students of Kerala's Sri Gokulam Catering College have started a dhaba to save the life of their classmate Aromal's sister

 For this reason, doctors have asked Aishwarya to get a kidney transplant
 haalanki, aishwarya kaa ek rishtedaar use kidney dene ke liye taiyaar he lekin is oparation ke liye 20 lakh rupee kii jarurat he
 According to Aishwarya's father, he sold all the land he owned in Thalandu, Pala so that he could deposit money for his daughter's transplant
 aromal ne bataaya, ''philhal aishwarya kaa ilaaj kotayam medical college main chal rahaa he lekin use transplant ke liye ernakulam ke ek privet aspataal main bhartee karnaa padegaa''

 china se saamaan pehle kalakatta laayaa jaataa he jahaan se duusare rajyo main bheja jaataa he
 "let us now know why Chinese ash is cheaper - Labor cost in India is much higher than in China - Colorful stones in India, and production of other items in Rakhi is negligible - if there is a production somewhere Also, it costs many times more than China - beautiful packing and other decorative items for decorating the pallets are very cheap at a very cheap cost in China

 On October 5, India and Russia launched 5 for the S-400 air defense missile
 4 arab dollar (kareeb 40,000 karod rupye) ke samjhaute par hastakshar kiye or yah donon deshon ke bich kaa sabase bada sauda he
 The agreement was signed during Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to India for the 19th annual india-russia Summit, which is a testimony to a special strategic partnership between the two countries
 rus agle do varshon main paanch missile system bharat ko saunpega
 India started importing weapons from the former Soviet Union in 1964 and this missile deal is the largest defense deal since then
 yah samjhauta is kaaran bhi vishesh he kyonki bharat ne spasht kar diya he ki vah rus ke saath apane sambandhon ko jari rakhane kaa icchhuk he or iske liye vah america pratibandhon kii bhi parvaah nahin karata
 One of the units included in the banned list of the Countering America Advertisers Through Sangtions Act (CAATSA) issued by the Russian missile manufacturer almaz-ante America
 america ne isi saal janvari main yah act lagu kiya tha jisamen vah apane pratidwandvi rashtron ke saath samjhauta karne vaale deshon par pratishodhatmak karrwai ke rup main vibhinn pratibandh lagane kii baat karata he
 The next day of the agreement, a US government spokesman specifically reacted to India's decision to purchase the S-400, saying China had also faced US sanctions if it had purchased similar missiles from Russia
 us adhikari ne kaha, sieetise main jo chhot ke praavdhaan hai, ve kisi khaas raashtra ke liye chhot nahin hai or iske maandand sakht hai
 Their talks do not indicate that the US has exempted New Delhi from CAATSA restrictions on purchasing arms from Russia
 adhikari ne kaha, ''chhot kaa dayera bahut simit he, or yah deshon ko roosi hathiyaaron kii kharid se rokane ko lekar bahut sakht he
 Discounts are given only on items such as components for already purchased equipment
 ''dekhnaa baaki he ki bharat ke khilaaf pratibandhon par america kaa kaisaa najariya rahata he
 South Block has prepared a financial system for this deal that will keep the western banking system on edge
 iske tahat bharat kharid ke liye bhugtan america dollar kii bajaae, rupye main karegaa or vah paisa nai dilli sthit rus kii sabarbank kii shakha main jamaa karaayaa jayega
 The opposition Congress was ready to react to the S-400 deal and on October 8, immediately after the deal, accused of an anomaly
 congress netaa manish tiwari ne twitor par poocha, ''kya bharat kii ofaset policy radd kar di gai he? to kya ab koi or ofaset nahin hoga? kya mek in india kaa vah mahaan naaraa khatai main pad gaya? yadi nahin, to phir ofaset partner koun he?''es-400 saude main, niyamon ke anusaar kam se kam 12,000 karod rupye kaa ofaset hua hota
 a defense ministry spokesperson said that no offset was needed in the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between India and Russia for the missiles, which may seem unusual but this is not the first time
 raksha mantralay ne raksha kharid prakriya (dipipi)-jo sabhi hathiyaaron kii kharid ko niyantrit karti he—ko lekar ek ofaset policy banaai he jiske tahat mul upkaran nirmaataa (oiem) ko bharat dwaara kharide ja rahe utpaadon kii kul laagat main se kam se kam 30 fisadi rakam ke baraabar kii kharid bharat ke bheetar se karnaa anivaary banaaya gaya he
 This offset policy is Rs 2,000 crore
 se adhik ke sabhi anubandhon par lagu hoti he or iskaa uddeshy hathiyaar kharidne kii jagah desh main hi hathiyaar nirmaan udyog ko viksit karnaa he
 The problem is that when it comes to big deals with Russia, this exception applies every time as a rule
 rus ke saath pichley do bade saude- 2006 main 80 emai-17 1ve medium lift helicopteron ke 660 million dollar kii kharid or 52 mig-29 vimaanon ke bede ko apgrade karne ke liye 865 million dollar ke qaraar—main bhi chhot de di gai
 Even the CAG raised a finger in 2013 over faulty execution of offsets
 rus ke saath jin anya raksha saudon par baatcheet chal rahi he usamen bhi offsets kii koi baat nahin ho rahi

 "isisi kaa samvidhan or prastaavit vittiya model agar sweekrut hote hai to ham empie anubandhon ke tahat apane adhikaron or kanoonee praavdhaanon kaa istemaal kar sakate hai

 "comments sutron ke mutabik prashaskon kii samiti tay kar chuki he ki antarrashtriya cricket main board ke vittiya hiton se kisi surat main samjhauta nahin hoga
 In the month of April, the ICC will think again on the reforms but due to the open opposition of the BCCCI, its plan seems to be in trouble, the Sri Lanka and Bangladesh Cricket Board have also objected to the new reforms

 Researchers managed to hack their rights by putting a chip in third party touch screen
 gauratlab he ki khatarnaak chip vaale tach screen vaale smartphone aapke smartphone kii gatividhi trek karte hai
 For example, your photos and app record data
 iske alaava is chip ke jariye hajaaron kilometre dur baithe havers aapke keyboard cmand or aapke personal videos par bhi control kar sakate hai
 Not only this, hackers can also gain complete control of the smartphone through phishing
 is tarah kii hekking kaa sabase bada nuksaan ye he ki ise anti virus detect nahin kar sakate hai
 Because these softwares are not hardware based
 doosraa nuksaan ye he ki jab aapane apane smartphone kaa screen riples kara liya he or ise yuj karne main aapako ehsaas nahin hota ki isamen koi khatarnaak chip lagaaya gaya he
 Researchers have used a hot air blower over the touchcontroller connection to insert this chip into the smartphone's screen

 The number of people who feel lonely in real life is increasing on Facebook
 ek taaja adhyayan ke mutabik log apni tanhai se nijaat paane or nae dost banane ke liye teji se fasebuk kaa rukh kar rahe hai

" akele rahane vaale aise log jo thode sharmile swabhaav ke hai yaa jinka samaaj main bahut kam logon se sampark he, ve apana saamaajik dayera badhaane ke liye fasebuk kaa rukh kar lete hai
 The study conducted this study to understand the interrelationship between using Facebook and people living alone and found that the more lonely a person is in public life, the more time Facebook spends
 shodh patrika 'computers in human bihavier' ke taaja ank main prakashit shodhpatr main song ne kaha, 'internet ke istemaal se logon main manovaigyanik samasyaayein jaise akelaapan kii pravritiyaan panapati he

 Leaders of Congress and BJP are constantly attacking each other
 congress netaa mim afjal ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ko rahul gandhi par is prakaar nishaanaa nahin sadhana chahie

 Rajiv Gandhi died in a blast at Sriperumbudur
 padhein aaj se thik 26 saal pehle kaise rachi gai rajeev gandhi kii hatya kii is sabase badi sajeesh or kisne or kaise diya anjaam
 Rajiv Gandhi's death anniversary Today, Sonia Gandhi paid homage to Veerbhoomi, Sri Lanka (november 1990) Prabhakaran was sitting in a terrorist hideout amidst dense forests
 uske saath baithe the uske chaar saathi
 Baby Subrahmanyam, Muthuraja, Murugan and Sivarasan
 ek badi sajeesh ban rahi thi
 The meeting lasted between hours of tension
 har aadmi apana paksh rakh rahaa tha
 The tension in this meeting was so secret that even the air sounded like the sound of a bomb
 umas or garmi ke bich prabhakaran bahut teji se sun or bun rahaa tha
 Eventually the plot was completed
 prabhakaran ne rajeev gandhi kii maut ke plan par muhar laga di
 The responsibility of completing the plan was entrusted to four people
 rajeev kii yaad main youth congress ke manch se bijepi par hamale kii taiyaaribaby subrahmanyam- littey idolog, hamalaavaron ke liye thikaane kaa jugad
 Muthuraja - Prabhakaran's special, the responsibility of communication and money for the attackers
 murugan- visphotak visheshgy, aatank guru, hamale ke liye jaruri chizon or paise kaa intjaam
 Sivarasan - LTTE detective, explosives expert, full responsibility for Rajiv Gandhi's assassination
 rajeev gandhi ke janmdin par gandhi parivaar ne di shradhanjali, PM narendra modi ne bhi kiya twitduniya ke sabase khoonkhaar aatankwaadi prabhakaran se rajeev kii hatya kaa farmaan lene ke baad baby subrahmanyam or muthuraja 1991 kii shuruyaat main chennai pahunche
 He was responsible for very important and early work
 baby or muthuraj ko chennai main aise log taiyaar karne the jo makasad se anjaan hote hue bhi deth squyod kii madad karen
 Especially for the killers of Rajiv Gandhi, give them a place to stay before the murder and a hideout after the murder
 baby subrahmanyam or muthuraja chennai main sidhe shubha news photo agency pahunche
 The agency's owner was Shubha Subrahmanyam Illam supporters
 shubha subrahmanyam ke paas donon kii madad kaa paigaam baby or muthuraja ke pahunchane se pehle hi aa chukaa tha
 Shubha had to provide local support for the plot
 yahaan pahunch kar baby or muthuraja ne apane apane target ke mutabik alag-alag kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 Baby Subrahmanyam first trapped Bhagyanathan, who works at Shubha News Photo Agency, in his clutches
 rajeev hatyakand main sajaa bhugat rahi nalini isi bhagyanathan kii bahan he jo us vakt ek printing press main kaam karti thi
 Bhagyanathan and Nalini's mother was a nurse
 nurse maa ko isi samay aspataal se mila ghar khaali karnaa tha
 Terrorist Baby caught Bhagyanathan and Nalini in difficult circumstances in the guise of money and help
 baby ne ek printing press bhagyanathan ko saste main bech diya
 This saved the family from getting on the road
 badale main nalini or bhagyanathan baby ke pyaade ho gaye
 The first phase of the conspiracy was to create a network of supporters who would be helpful in slowly carrying out the conspiracy locked in vicious minds but without knowing anything
 subramanyam swami bole- rajeev gandhi hote to ban gaya hota ram mandirek taraf baby subrahmanyam chennai main rahane ke surakshit thikaane bana rahaa tha to muthuraja behad shaatir tareeke se logon ko apni krur sajeesh ke liye chun rahaa tha
 Those working in Chennai's Shubha News Photo Agency became a boon for these devils
 yaheen se muthuraja ne do photographer ravishankaran or haribabu chune
 Ravi Shankaran and Haribabu both worked as photographers at Shubha News Photocopy Agency
 haribabu ko naukari se nikaal diya gaya tha
 Muthuraja got Haribabu a job at Vigyaneshwar Agency
 srilanka se baalan naam ke ek shaks ko bula kar haribabu kaa shagird banaaya
 This led to Haribabu getting a lot of money and his inclination towards Muthuraja
 muthuraja ne ahsaan ke boj tale dabe haribabu ko rajeev gandhi ke khilaaf khub bhadakaayaa ki agar wo 1991 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jeet kar satta main aae to tamilon kii or durgati hogi
 a brick-and-mortar plot was being planned to assassinate Rajiv
 srilanka main baithe murugan ne is bich jai kumaaran or robert paayas ko chennai bheja
 Both of them stayed at Saviri Nagar Extension in Purur
 yahaan jayakumaran kaa jija littey bam export ariveyu perulibalan 1990 se chhip kar rah rahaa tha
 The purpose of sending these two from Sri Lanka to Chennai was to involve longtime computer engineer and electronic expert Ariyveu Perulibalan in the conspiracy so that he could make a murder tool bomb
 aage chalakar porur kaa yahi ghar rajeev gandhi hatyakand ke plan kaa headquarter ban gaya
 It was from here that the whole conspiracy reached Sriperumbudur
 congress netaa kii kitaab se khulaasa, rajeev gandhi nahin chaahate the ki pranab mukherjee bane pradhanmantrishatir sutaradhar judane vaale har shaks ke dimag main rajeev gandhi ke khilaaf bheeshan nafrat bhi paidaa kar rahaa tha
 He was aware that without fierce hatred, the horrific plot would not reach its end
 jab baby or muthuraja ne apane apane chaar log jod liye to sajeesh main murugan kii entry hui
 By reaching Chennai, Murugan intensified his efforts to bring the conspiracy to great effect
 murugan ke ishaare par jayakumaran or paayas
 nalini-bhagyanathan-baby-reached Muthuraja's hideout
 rajeev gandhi virdohi bhavanaaen logon ke dimag main bhari jane lageen
 Nalini was fully prepared against Rajiv Gandhi
 nalini jis priting press main naukari karti thi vahaan chap rahi ek kitaab satanik forces ne uske brinwash main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Murugan, along with Brainwash, forged fake driving licenses with the help of Jayakumaran and Pius to create fake identities of the killers
 murugan, muthuraja or baby ne milakar chennai main chhipane ke teen mahfuj thikaane khoj liye
 a bomb maker was ready as Araviu
 rajeev ke khilaaf nafrat se bhare nalini padma or bhagyanathan kii oot taiyaar thi
 a man like Shubha Subrahmanyam was ready to provide
 ab shivarasana ko sandeshaa bheja gaya
 In early March, he reached Chennai by sea
 wo porur ke isi ilaake main paayas ke ghar main rukaa
 JNU spoke on the matter - Rajiv Gandhi never stood with the opponents of the country, Porur became the controlroom of the conspiracy to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi
 shivarasana ke porur pahunchate hi jafana ke jangalon kii sajeesh kaa jaal puraa ho gaya
 Sivarasan took over the command
 baby auki muthuraj ko srilanka waapas bhej diya gaya
 In Chennai, Sivarasan along with Nalani, Murugan and Bhagyanathan searched for Manavabam but could not find it
 shivarasana ne ariveyu peruli baalan ke bam kii digaayan ko check kiya, shivarasana khud acha visphotak export tha
 Seeing all the preparations complete, Shivarasan then went back to Jaffna by way of sea in the Itanjam of Manavam, where he met Prabhakaran
 usne prabhakaran ko bataaya ki bharat main maanavbam nahin mil rahaa he
 At this, Prabhakaran sent Sivarasan's cousins dhanu and Shubha to India with him
 dhanu or shubha ko lekar shivarasana april kii shuruuaat main chennai pahunchaa
 He took Dhanu and Shubha to Nalini's house
 yahaan murugan pehle se maujuud tha
 Sivarasan kept pius-jayakumaran-bomb designer Arivu away from him in a very vicious manner and himself lived in Porur's hideout
 wo samay-samay par sabko sahi karrwai ke nirdesh detaa tha
 Now the conspiracy to kill Rajiv Gandhi was going on in three locations in Chennai
 shivarasana ne target kaa khulaasa kiye bina bam export allivu se ek aisa bam banane ko kaha jo mahila kii qamar main baandha ja sake
 Rajiv Gandhi assassination accused Perarivalan jailed, hospitalized At the behest of Shivarasan, Arivu designed a belt in which six RDX filled grenades could be loaded
 har grenade main assi gram sifor adiex bharaa gaya
 Each grenade has two thousand eight hundred splinter of two millimeters
 saare grenade ko silver taar kii madad se paralal joda gaya
 Two switches were placed to complete the circuit
 inamen se ek switch bam ko taiyaar karne ke liye or doosraa usamen dhamaakaa karne ke liye tha or puure bam ko charge dene ke liye 9 mem kii bydaree lagaai gai
 The sprinter deposited in the grenade was fired at least 5000 meters per second in explosive, ie every sprinter became a bullet
 bam ko is tarah se digaayan kiya gaya tha ki ardex chaahe jitna kam ho agar dhamaakaa ho to target batch na sake or vahi hua bhi
 Now Sivarasan had a bomb in his hand as well as Dhanu, the human bomb that carried the bomb
 itanjar tha to bas rajeev gandhi kaa par isse pehle wo apni sajeesh ko thok bajaakar dekh lenaa chahta tha
 Aaj Tak has video of the rally held at Marina Beach in Chennai during the general elections in 1991
 is video main shivarasana apane target rajeev gandhi se mahaj 25-30 feet kii duuri par saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 In this rally of Jayalalithaa and Rajiv, Sivarasan arrived to take stock of Rajiv's safety
 yahaan usne rajeev kii janata se khul kar milane or lachar suraksha kii khaamiyon ko bhaanp liya par vanid jaik shivarasana yaheen nahin rukaa
 To ensure the experience of this rally, he took Manavbaum Dhanu with him in another political rally
 tasveeron main dekhen rajeev gandhi kaa jivan | rajeev
 
 
 a Yatra On 12 May 1991, shivarasan-dhanu performed the final Reiki at the rally of former PM VP Singh and DMK supremo Karunanidhi
 tiruvallur ke arkonam main hui is raily main dhanu veepi singh ke behad paas tak pahunchi usne unke pair bhi chhue
 Just did not press the button of the bomb
 purv pradhanmantri veepi singh kii raily main suraksha kaa str rajeev kii suraksha ke baraabar na sahi to kam bhi nahin tha par shivarasana or dhanu ke shaatir iraade kaamyaab rahe
 This boosted Sivarasan's spirits and he saw his plan succeeding
 loksabhaa chunaav kaa daur tha rajeev gandhi kii meeting 21 may ko shreeperambdur main tay ho gai
 Shivarasan decided in a blink of an eye that the plot would be completed on 21st
 20 kii raat shivarasana nalini ke ghar raily ke vigyaapan vaala akhbaar lekar pahunchaa or tay ho gaya ki ab 21 ko hi sajeesh puri hogi
 Dhanu wore glasses to trick security agencies for the first time on the night of 20 May at Nalini's house
 shubha ne dhaanu ko belt pahana kar practice karwaai or shreeperambdur main kis tarah sajeesh ko anjaam tak pahunchaana he isaki puri taiyaari mukammal kar lee gai
 All were completely calm and ready for the cause
 20 may kii raat ko sabhi ne saath milakar film dekhi or so gaye
 In the morning, five people were ready to complete the shivarasan-dhanu-shubha-nalini and Haribabu plot
 parole par baahar ai rajeev gandhi hatyakand kii doshi nalinisriperambdur main raily kii gahamagahami thi
 Rajiv Gandhi's arrival was delayed
 baar-baar elaan ho rahaa tha ki rajeev kisi bhi vakt raily ke liye pahunch sakate hai
 The plot that had been brewing for the last six months was very close to its end
 ek mahila sab inspector ne use dur rahane ko kaha par rajeev gandhi ne use rokte hue kaha ki sabko paas aane kaa mauka milanaa chahie
 They did not know that they were calling the death not the public
 nalini ne maala pahanaai, pair chune ke liye jhuki or bas sajeesh puri ho gai
 Sivarasan ran towards Chennai soon after the blast
 nalini or sudhaa usase chennai main aakar mili
 There Sivarasan told Sudha that Haribabu was killed but his camera was lying there
 shivarasana ne sundaram ko haribabu kaa camera maukey se udaane kii jimmedaari saunpi
 Sundaram tried hard but failed and then the photographs captured in that camera roll gave the clues that led Rajiv's killers to the clutches of the investigation team
 suraksha main khami thi, ye sach he par usase bada sach ye he ki aakhir littey rajeev gandhi ko maarane ke liye is kadar utaaru kyon tha
 Its answer and clues tell you
 pradhanmantri banane ke teen saal ke bheetar srilankai grihayuddh khatm karne ke liye rajeev gandhi ne srilanka ke raashtrapati je aar jayavardhane ke saath ek shanti samjhauta kiya
 In this, the Indian Peace Keeping Force had to restore peace by putting weapons of LTTE and other Tamil terrorists, but the stance backfired
 littey ne samjhaute kii peeth par khanjar bhonk diya
 The evening of the settlement, Sri Lankan naval Vijitha Rohana attacked Rajiv Gandhi
 vijitha ne bandook kii bat rajeev par de maari
 If he had a broom, he would have killed him too
 bal-bal batch gaye the rajeev
 Had there been a gunshot, Rajiv Gandhi probably would not have survived the same day
 saaf tha samjhaute ne srilankai tamilon main rajeev gandhi ke prati nafrat bhar di thi
 Meanwhile, in 1988, Rajiv Gandhi thwarted the coup attempt of the Tamil organization PLOTE in Maldives by sending the Indian Army
 tamil aatankiyon main ise lekar bhi khaasi naaraazgi thi
 As a result, Prabhakaran killed Rajiv Gandhi soon after the Indian Peace Keeping Force's full withdrawal from Sri Lanka in 1990
 halaki littey apane upar lage aaropon se inkaar karata aayaa he
 The Rajiv Gandhi government, which had prepared for the hydrogen bomb test in 1985, claims in CIA documents that the greatest security ends where someone is intent on sacrificing his life
 rajeev gandhi hatyakand main bhi aisa hua
 Manavam's bet was very big and serious
 baavjood iske aakhir chook hui to kyon
 Rajiv Gandhi was surrounded by terrible dangers
 phir tashtaree main paros kar unki jaan aakhir kyon aatankiyon ke saamne rakh di gai
 If the head of the investigation team is to be believed, then the Central Government had no idea who killed Rajiv
 baavjood iske ki chennai or jafana ke bich chal rahe sandeshon main ek bhartiya netaa kii hatya kii sajeesh pakad lee gai thi
 Apart from this, the IB and the Ministry of Home Affairs were also issuing an alert regarding Rajiv's safety, but Rajiv's life was left in the trust of two sub-inspectors of Delhi Police
 1984 main aitihaasik jeet darj karne vaale rajeev ko 1989 main karaari shikast ne sadamein main daal diya tha
 Rajiv felt that his distance from the public was driving him away from power
 lihaaja wo 1991 ke chunaav main janata se judaav ko hi apni pahchaan bana rahe the
 He would go more and more among the public
 suraksha jahaan aade aati use fatkaar dete
 Tamil Nadu government cannot release Rajiv Gandhi's killers: SC also says that Rajiv Gandhi transferred some police officers of UP because Rajiv was extremely angry with their security
 rajeev se jab log aise jokhim na uthaane ko kehete to unka jawaab hota, 'main janata par avishvaas nahin kar saktaa, main kab tak suraksha kii chintaa karuunga, muje jindagi jini he
 'but Rajiv may have forgotten that being alive is the first and last condition for cultivating the love of the public
 rajeev apni jind par ade rahe, suraksha ko dhata bataa rahe or dushman bhi apni jid par ada rahaa

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar launched a statewide campaign against two more anomalies of the society, child marriage and dowry, on 2 October this year after the imposition of prohibition in Bihar
 nitish kumaraka maananaa tha ki sharaab bandi kii tarah bal vivaah or dahej pratha bhi samaaj main faili aisi buraaiyaan hai, jise dur kiya janaa chahie
 Now the result of this new campaign of Nitish Kumar is also being seen within a month
 pichley dinon bhojpur jile main prakaash saah naam ke yuvak or puja kumari kii shaadi sampann hui
 Prakash is a resident of Chaturbhuji Baran village of Bhojpur and Pooja is a resident of Sikarhata village
 donon kii pichley dinon shaadi hui or khaas baat yah rahi ki yah shaadi ek adarsh vivaah ban gai
 Because neither money was transacted in this marriage, nor any dowry exchange
 prakaash ke pita kaa kahana tha ki jis prakaar senithish ne dahej pratha ke khilaafabihar main abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii he, usase vah kaaphi prabhavit hue the or isse prabhavit hokar unhone faisla kiya ki vah apane bete kii shaadi bina dahej liye hi karenge
 This idyllic marriage without dowry came into the limelight when Chief Minister Nitish Kumar called the married couple to Patna and met them at his residence
 yah mulaakaat 28 oktober ko hui, jismenithish kumaarane prakaash or puja kii prashansa kii or unhen aashirwad diya
 To encourage the newly married couple, he was also given a citation on behalf of the Chief Minister for marrying without dowry

 The Trinamool Congress was filled with seats and the party won 211 out of 294 seats
 yah vam dalon or congress ke gathjod ke liye badi hi sharmnaak haar thi
 This nexus was made with a lot of uneasiness and in this way it was natural
 donon partiyaan is saajhedaari ke bhavishya ko lekar jitne sanshay main thim, matadaata bhi utane hi bhramit the
 When the picture of Trinamool's massive victory was cleared, Mamta said, "the public is sensible
" kai jhooth bole gaye, shadyantr kiye gaye lekin unhone sach ko pahchaan liya
 After this, his phone rang continuously — Arun Jaitley wanted to congratulate him

 But i was very saddened by your decision

 To see how much work his government has done at the grassroots level and how much it has impacted, he did about 200 rallies and measured the 100 km route on foot
 unhone logon se poocha, ‘‘kya aapako phaayde mil rahe hai, aap chup kyon ho?’’ jahaan unhen lagata ki adhikariyon ne apana kaam thik se nahin kiya he to ve unhen saream jhadap bhi deteen
 Says Trinamool MP Sudeep Bandopadhyay, "personal contact, fast decision making, keeping in touch with block level officials are all part of his good administration
" ’’unke judaav kaa matadaataaon ne sammaan bhi kiya or is par bhrashtachar or aaropon kaa koi asar nahin padaa
 He told voters, "I am a mother
" maine trinmul ko janm diya he
 If one or two people come out poorly in a family of 20, 30 or 50 people, then the whole family cannot be blamed

 Crores of rupees on this win

 Banning the chance of victory, Mamta said, "we do honest politics
 bhrashtachar ke aarope to bijepi, congress, vam dalon or abeepi media kii sajeesh hai
 "by the way, Mamata's opponents also believe that her government has helped the people
" vam-congress gathbandhan ke pramukh chehre or mamata ke katu aalochak congressi netaa maanas bhuiyaan ne kaha, ‘‘vyaktigat laabh
 The result of the election proves that this time 'what is my community or my state getting' has been dominated by 'what i am getting'

 Sarkar says, "what has been done for the rural poor, this is the formula that determines the outcome of elections in India
" is tabake ke liye kiya gaya kaam hi mamata ke liye phydemand sabit hua
 The credit for Mamta's victory goes to her pro-people, pro-farmer and pro-poor policies

 Shortly after the victory, he said, "we have good relations with Nitish Kumar and Laluji

 satluj-yamuna link par kejariwal sarkaar supreme court main halafanama daayar karne ke baad jahaan punjab main badal sarkaar ke nishane par aa gai he, vahiin dilli main damege control karte hue sarkaar ne SC main halafanama daayar karne vaale vakil ko hi hataa diya he
 In an affidavit filed on Friday, the Delhi government said that it could not support Punjab on the Haryana government's water dispute
 bataa den ki halafname main kejariwal kii sarkaar ne haryana sarkaar kaa samarthan kiya or saaf taur par kaha ki punjab sarkaar haryana kaa pani nahin roak sakati
 Since then, the AAP government has been accused of adopting double standards, because Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has already said in the case that the Punjab government should take back the canal land and return it to the farmers
 lambey samay tak vakil ne kiya congress sang kaamadusari ore, dilli sarkaar ke ravaiye par aapatti jataate hue punjab main dipti siem sukhbir badal ne press conference kar dilli sarkaar or aam aadmi party par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 The AAP, which is dreaming of being in power in the assembly elections in the state, came to the backfoot soon after
 dilli sarkaar ne karrwai karte hue halafanama daayar karne vaale vakil ko hataa diya
 The reason stated that that lawyer has been associated with Congress for a long time

 Whatever states are connected to it, references are being taken in the case from all
 isi ke tahat dilli sarkaar ne court main halafanama daayar karalag-alag binduonper bayaan diya he
 It is a matter of the Punjab Termination Act 2004, in which Punjab says that the treaty that has been reached earlier has come out of it and is not binding
 is par apane halafname main dilli sarkaar ne kaha he ki yah act asanvaidhanik he or aisa act banane kaa adhikaar rajya ko nahin he
 The Delhi government's lawyer has said in the court that the Punjab government cannot stop Haryana
 ek anya reference main dilli sarkaar ne jal board kii ore se daayar halafname main kaha he ki kisi bhi daayitv ke saath punjab bandhaa hua nahin he or punjab ne kaha tha ki vah sandhiyon se bandhaa hua nahin he
 Overall, the Delhi government in its affidavit mostly supported the Haryana government, while supporting Punjab on a point

 The US, which has been strict on the issue of illegal citizens, can now teach Pakistan a tough lesson in this direction
 vija avadhi khatm hone ke baavjood bhi america main rah rahe apane nagarikon ko pakistan ne lene se inkaar kar diya he
 After this, America has warned him in strict words on this attitude of Pakistan
 america ne yahaan tak kah diya he ki vah pakistaniyon ke vija par roak laga saktaa he or isaki shuruyaat sabase pehle adhikariyon se hogi
 This warning from the US is being considered a major setback for Pakistan
 kyonki pakistan un deshon main shaamil he, jin par america kaa avaidh nagirak sambandhi kanoon lagu hota he
 According to this law, citizens of those countries who are not extradited from the US and who do not take back their citizens who remain after the expiry of the visa period will not be given a US visa
 pakistan ne america ke is kanoon kii avhelnaa karte hue apane nagirakon ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya he
 After which the US has given this warning
 america ke videsh vibhaag ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki pakistan main duutavas sambandhit kaamkaaj main abhi ke liye 'koi badlaav nahin' he lekin america pakistani nagarikon ke vija roak saktaa he jisaki shuruyaat uske varisht adhikariyon se ho sakati he
 This warning has come because Pakistan is the new country in the list of ten countries to which sanctions have been imposed under US law according to which countries which were extradited and not returning to their citizens living even after the expiry of the visa period Citizens of those countries will not be granted US visas
 haalanki, videsh vibhaag ne pakistan par in pratibandhon ke asar ko kam karne kii koshish kii he
 a State Department spokesman has told the news agency language that there will be no change in the functioning of the embassy in Pakistan
 videsh vibhaag ke mutabik, yah america or pakistani sarkaron ke bich chal rahaa dwipaksheeya mudda he or ham is samay baarikiyon main nahin ja rahe hai
 At the same time, former Pakistan Ambassador to the US, Hussain Haqqani, believes that this will create problems for Pakistan
 hakkaani kaa kahana he ki is kadam se pakistaniyon ke liye mushkilen paidaa hongi jo america main yatra karnaa chaahate hai or isse bachaa ja saktaa tha agar pakistani adhikariyon ne pratyrpan kii kanoonee anivaarytaaon ke sambandh main america ke anurodhon ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya hota
 He said that Pakistan's refusal to accept its citizens extradited from the US is not new
 yani agar pakistan apane rukh par kaayam rahata he to aise halaat bhi paidaa ho sakate hai ki uske nagarikon ko america kii seemaa main daakhil hone kii ijaajat hi na mil sake
 Even officials of Pakistan may have to face this difficulty

 aisa koi din nahin bitta jab jagan mohan reddy andhra pradesh ke pashchim godaavari jile kaa daura kar vot na maangate hon
 It has become common for this 38-year-old leader to rally and go for votes at every door
 may ke ant tak is kshetra kii 18 vidhansabha siton ke liye matdaan hona he or ek loksabhaa seat nellore ke liye bhi upachunaav hona he
 The Election Commission has yet to decide the date for future elections in these areas, but Jagan Mohan has just started a series of electoral visits in these areas
 khabar yahaan tak he ki sibiai unhen bhrashtachar ke maamalon main giraftaar bhi kar sakati he
 At the same time, this young leader is blaming his former party Congress for all the allegations leveled against him
 chargeshit main jagan mohan ke pita or congress ke diggaj netaa or tatkaaleen mukhyamantri wiesar reddy kaa bhi naam likhaa gaya he
 YSR died in a helicopter crash in 2009

 And this is where Jagan gives Mohan the opportunity to revive his election speech
 jagan mohan logon se kah rahe hai ki janata in chunaavon main na keval rajya kii congress sarkaar ko sabak sikhaye balki dilli main baithe unke remote control ko bhi sabak sikhaane ke liye vot kare
 The CBI is saying that Jagan today has assets worth Rs 365 crore which grew during his father's tenure as Chief Minister
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki wiesar ne apane pad kaa durupyog karte hue companiyon par dabaav banaaya or jagan kii companiyon main invest karavaaya
 The comments pita kii aakasmik maut ke baad jagan congress se baahar ho gaye kyonki unhen unke pita ke baad siem nahin banaaya gaya
 Jagan then formed a separate party of his own and traveled to Odarpu across the state to gain sympathy from the people
 is yatra ko rajya main apaar safalataa mili
 At present, the corruption case against Jagan does not seem to be much concern
 pichley maheene rajya main saat siton par hue vidhansabha ke chunaav main congress ek bhi seat hasil nahin kar pai
 Right now, on one side, the Congress is struggling with the mutual fight of the leaders in the party, on the other hand, on all the issues of the state such as the issue of Telangana, but the leaders are yet to decide on which side they should sit
 chunaav ayog ko in ilaakon ke bhavi chunaav kii taarikh abhi tay kerani he lekin jagan mohan ne abhi se in ilaakon main silsilewar tareeke se chunavi daura aarambh kar rakhaa he
 The news is even that the CBI may arrest him in corruption cases
 vahiin, is yuva netaa ne apane par lagaae sabhi aaropon ke liye apni purv party congress ko doshi bataa rahe hai

 sibiai kah rahi he ki aaj jagan ke paas 365 karod rupee kii sampatti he jo unke pita ke mukhyamantri ke kaarykaal ke dauraan badi
 The CBI says that YSR misused his position to put pressure on companies and got Jagan invested in companies
 tippaniyan Jagan dropped out of the Congress after his father's accidental death as he was not made CM after his father
 uske baad jagan ne apni ek alag party banaai or puure rajya main odarpu yatra kii taaki logon se sahanubhuti hasil kii ja sake

 Along with this, the court has also warned that if the Center and MCI fail to do so, it will be considered contempt of court

 'input language apni metric kii pariksha puri hote hi 17 varshiya supriya (badla hua naam) baari raahat mahasoos kar rahi he
 The matriculation examination i
e
 the tenth board examination in Bihar was completed on 25 March
 supriya kaa parivaar bhi utani hi raahat mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Supriya's elder brother, working in the Paramilitary Battalion, had to take his medical leave to help him in the examination
 supriya ke jija sarkari skool main teacher hai or unhen puraa bharosa he ki vah achche ankon ke saath pariksha uteern karegi
 Good marks are required for a job in the state
 ladakiyon ke liye yah or chunauteepurn hota he
 The groom's family members want the girl to have matriculation with at least the First Division for marriage
 is tarah pradesh main pariksha hameshaa paariwarik prayaas ban jaati he
 Using his paramilitary skills, Supriya's brother would climb the exam center wall and balance the thin edges with a chit from his brother-in-law to get his sister to the sister of the question paper
 supriya ke pita kii vyavhaar kushalta bhi kaam ai thi or ve pariksha ke dauraan apni beti tak pahunch sunishchit karne main safal rahe
 In fact, in the recently completed matriculation examination, at least four persons were seen as an ally of every candidate
 unamem ek parikshaarthi ke vyavhaar kushal pita hote, doosraa diwaar par chadhakar chit pahunchane main maahir noujvaan, to teesraa ek kushagra vyakti jis par sawaal ke jawaab taiyaar karne kii jimmedaari hoti
 The fourth would be an influential neighbor or friend whose job is to ensure internal help by reaching out to the supervisor
 17 march ko shuru hui bihar board kii metric pariksha main 1,100 pariksha kendron par 14
 More than 26 lakh students participated
 anuchit taur-tareekon ke istemaal ke aarope main pariksha ke pehle do din hi 1,000 se zyada parikshaarthi nishkasit hue
 But it is not that widespread imitation has been seen for the first time in the state
 dasvin board kii pariksha ek benchmark he or pradesh ke gramin samaaj main metric paas chaatr-chaatraon ko sammaan se dekha jaataa he
 It has always been so
 1970 ke dashak main karpuri thakur kii tatkaaleen sarkaar ne angreji vishay kii anivaaryta khatm kar di thi
 At that time it was announced that the failed candidates in English will also be considered as 'matric pass'
 is avadharana ko vyangy main 'karpuri divijan' bhi kaha gaya tha
 Thus matriculation is extremely important in the state
 jaisaa pradesh ke shiksha mantri pi
 K
 shahi ne kaha he, nakal sirf bihar main nahin hoti
 But the social recognition of mimicry sets it apart
 'open book exam' kii avadharana par pashchimi deshon kaa dhyaan jane ke varshon pehle nakal ke jariye bihar main students ise aajamaate rahe hai
 The state is famous all over the country as a candidate-friendly state
 is saal padosi jharkhand or orissa se rajasthan tak ke parikshaarthi degree paane ke liye bihar board kii pariksha main shaamil paae gaye
 Hundreds of copycat gangs are also active in the state, which have penetration in the education department and schools
 nakal ke aarope main parikshaarthi bhale nishkasit ho jaaen, giroh ke mukhiya pakad main nahin aate
 These gangs even claim to have filled the form to get the exam and score better
 uske liye 50,000 ru
 We charge till haalanki iskaa koi bharosemand record nahin he ki pariksha main nakal rokane main dilchaspee lenaa teacheron ne kab band kar diya par purana daur dekh chuke logon ke mutabik 60 ke dashak ke aakhri varshon main kuch anya masalon par chaatr andolan ke saath metric or intermediat kii parikshaon main nakal teji se faili
 Soon it became widely accepted
 1996 main patna hycourt ne sakchati dikhaai thi or jila jaj kii dekharekh main parikshaayen huin
 Then only 12% of the 5,74,110 candidates had passed
 vittarahit skulon ko chaatro kii sankhya or metric paas karne kii shrenee ke hisaab se anudaan milanaa, certificate lao or naukari paao ke aadhaar par bade paimaane par teacher bahaali tathaa sanvida aadhaarit naukariyon main bhi ank ke aadhaar par bahaali jaisi yojanaon kaa phayda paane kii chaah main bhi log nakal ke liye prerit hote hai
 The education minister's statement shows that the government is not serious about copying
 shahi ne vidhansabha main apane vibhaag kii bajet paricharchaa main jawaab dete hue kaha, ''kis pariksha main anuchit sadhano kaa istemaal nahin hota he? metric pariksha se lekar upiessi pariksha tak aisa istemaal hota he
 CBI is investigating the examination of Aquas
 kis rajya main nakal nahin hoti? '' shahi ne parikshaarthiyon ke abhibhavakon or unke shubhachintakon ko nakal kaa jimmedaar tehra diya tha, jisase unki aalochana ho rahi thi
 He expressed his inability to rein in the media after photographs of the group were mimicked
 vidambnaa ki shahi ne jo kuch bhi kaha, vah kadava sach he
 About 14 lakh examinees and their four-five relatives, ie, in the examination in which 70 lakh people are involved, 100 percent purity without public cooperation is not easy
 vahiin bijepi ne shahi ke asamarthta jataane par unke istife kii maang kii to patna hycourt ne unke bayaan ko sangyaan main liya or sarkaar ko nakal rokane ke liye karrwai karne kaa nirdesh diya
 RJD president Lalu Yadav, on whose support the Nitish government rests, inaugurated a school in a remote countryside in Bansar, sparking controversy by saying, "if we had a government, we would have given the book to the examinees to write

 haal hi main relies hui superstar rajnikant kii film 'kabali' main radhika apte or is superstar kii jodi ne hamen ek baar phir bollywood kii un on screen jodiyon kii yaad dilaa di he jinamein age gap kii hameshaa se charchaa rahi he
 Superstar Rajinikanth is also a special figure in himself, but a special and interesting thing about him is that even at the age of 65, he is doing films with his under-50s
 haal hi main unki film 'kabali' khub surkhiyaan bator rahi he
 This time too, the actress of Rajinikanth's film is the young actress of the industry
 film 'kabali' ke 65 saal ke hero superstararajnikantaur unki heroin hai 30 saal kii radhika apte
 Radhika Apte recently shared the experience of working with Rajinikanth, saying, "I must have been in school when he became a superstar
" rajnikant kii pichhali filmon kii actress par bhi najar daalen to wo bhi skool main rahi hongi jab wo star the
 Be it the actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan of Rajinikanth's film 'robot' or Sonakshi Sinha, the heroine of 'linga'
 naa sirf superstar rajnikant balki bollywood king khan shahrukh khan kii filmon main unki actress ke taur par industry kii yang adaakaaraon ko sin kiya ja rahaa he
 Recently, Shah Rukh will be seen with young star Alia Bhatt of industry in Shah Rukh's upcoming film Dear Zindagi
 haalanki is film main shahrukh aalia ke menter kaa kirdaar adaa kar rahe hai
 Apart from the actor and actress's age gap in these latest films, let us know before and in the upcoming films, our superstar Kinmin has been signed with actresses and is going to be: Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone
 Deepika Padukone got a break in Bollywood from Om '
 us dauraan deepika kii umr 21 saal thi or shahrukh deepika se doguni umr ke the yani 42 saal ke
 Even after this film, Deepika worked with Shahrukh in the films 'chennai Express' and 'happy New Year'
 shahrukh khan-anoushka sharmabollywood kii is onscreen jodi par bhi ye baat lagu hoti he
 Because Anushka Sharma is 23 years younger than Shah Rukh and has worked with Shah Rukh in two films as an actress
 in filmon main shaamil hai 'rab ne bana di jodi' or 'jab tak he jaan'
 Salman khan-sonakshi Sinhasalan is 21 years older than Sonakshi and she launched Sonakshi Sinha through the hit film Dabangg
 salmaan kaa stardam sonakshi ke liye phydemand bhi rahaa or 'dabang 2' main bhi ye safata doharaai gai
 By the way, Sonakshi also made appearances with Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgan, who are much older than them in age, but the 'dabangg' success was not achieved again
 ajay devgan-sishiujay devgan kii aane vaali film 'shivaay' main abhi 12veen kii padhai kar raheen sisha sahagal ajay devgan ke saath najar aaengi
 If we guess the age gap of Saisha and Ajay Devgan, then Saisha would have been only 6 years old when Ajay Devgan was at the height of her film career
 sisha, shaheen or sumit sahagal kii beti hai or syra bano ke khanadan se taalluk rakhti hai
 This list of actor and actress's age gap can be even longer because no matter how many female-oriented films are made today, the hero's dominance is still intact

 adaalat main zyaadaatar vakt shaini chupchaap khadey rahe, haalanki adaalat main shaini ke vakil shrikant shirde kaa kahana tha ki beeti raat se kain ghanton tak police ne shaini se poochtacha kii he, or naa hi ye koi hatya kaa maamla he, jisamen hathiyaar yaa kisi duusari cheez ko baraamad karne kii jarurat he, isliye police castady kii koi jarurat nahin he, lekin adaalat ne bachaav paksh kii daleelein thukaraate hue teen din kii hiraasat manjuur kar di
 'shiney has been implicated' At the time of the court, Shiney's family members were also present
 shaini ke parivaar ke mutabik unhen bevajaah fansaaya gaya he
 Shiney was called to the Oshiwara police station late in the evening
 raat hi media kaa jamaavada bhi lag gaya, to mumbai police ke tamaam aalaa adhikari oshivara pahunche, maamle ke har pahalu par gaur kiya, uske baad hi shaini ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 According to police sources, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the maid reached Shiney's house at Tarapur Tower near Oshiwara police station and after leaving at 5 o'clock she reached the police station directly where she heard the policemen on duty
 ladki kii shikaayat lekar use medical ke liye bhijwa diya gaya or jab der shaam medical report main balaatkaar kii pushti hui to shaini ahuja ko thane bulavaa liya gaya
 The police also sent Shiney for medical and when the suspicion of the police strengthened, Shiney was arrested after all the paperwork including the FIR
 shaini par balaatkaar ke saath hi gunaah ko chhipaane ke liye peedit ko jaan se maarane kii dhamkee dene kaa aarope laga he
 If the charges against Shiney are proved, then Shiney's entire career and more than that his life can be ruined
 agar ye iljaam adaalat main sabit hue, to shaini ko 8 saal se lekar umrakaid tak kii sajaa bhi ho sakati he

 ) In the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, the Congress candidates in Amethi and Rae Bareli, the strongholds of the nehru-gandhi family, are finding it difficult when the Congress has fielded its star campaigner Priyanka Gandhi
 is tarah jativaadee raajnneeti ko badalakar vikasvaadi banane kaa bidaa uthaane vaale apane saansad bhai rahul gandhi se amethi or raibareli kii 10 siton par jeet dilaane kaa vaada nibhaane ke mishan par nikali congress kii star prachaarak priyanka gandhi kii saakh is baar daanv par bhi he
 The Amethi and Rae Bareli parliamentary constituencies have been considered to be the legacy of the nehru-gandhi family's political legacy since independence and the results of the 10 assembly seats in these two regions are not only important for the success of Rahul's 'mission-2012' Instead, their results will also determine the political stature of the Congress General Secretary
 aise main yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki priyanka kii bhi saakh daanv par he
 The Congress high command is well aware of the odd political situation prevailing in the 10 assembly constituencies in Amethi and Rae Bareli
 yahi vajah he ki vah priyanka ko amethi or raibareli par hi dhyaan kendrit karne ko kah rahaa he
 The anxiety of the Congress can be gauged from the fact that a star campaigner like Priyanka has been entrusted with five days of staying in Amethi to try and shake the pulse of voters through emotional appeal
 khud priyanka ne bhi apane amethi daure ke pehle din shuukravaar ko sweekaar kiya ki unhen amethi tathaa raibareli ke 10 vidhansabha kshetron par hi dhyaan dene ko kaha gaya he or sambhavat: vah inhen jilon tak simit rahengi
 Somewhere in the mind of the general voters of Amethi, it is said that Priyanka comes to the area only during the elections and after that she does not take care of the people here
 aise main unki apilon par kitna vishwaas kiya jaae
 Priyanka also realizes this and she has admitted this mistake in meetings and public meetings with the workers
 saath hi is baat kaa vishwaas bhi dilaa rahi hai ki ab unhen shikaayat kaa mauka nahin milegaa
 SP and BSP have made special fortifications to move Congress land in Amethi and Rae Bareli
 congress ke liye yah bhi chintaa kii baat he
 If we look at the electoral atmosphere of Amethi, then this time the Congress is facing a tough challenge
 varsh 2007 main hue pichley vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko jile kii paanch main se teen amethi, jagadishpur or salon siton par kamyaabi mili thi, lekin is baar siyaasi sameekaran badal gayi hai
 In the last election, at least two out of the three seats won by the Congress, the Congress candidates are getting tough competition from rivals
 amethi seat se congress pratyaashee maujuuda vidhayak amita singh ko sapa ke gayatri prasad prajapati or basapa ke ashish shukla se kadi chunauti mil rahi he
 On the request of sitting Congress MLA Ramsevak Dhobi on Jagdishpur seat, the party has nominated his grandson Radheshyam Kanaujia
 radheshyaam raajnneeti main bilkul naye hai or unhen pratidwandviyon se kadi takkar mil rahi he
 Congress candidate Mohammad Naeem appears to be in a good position on Gauriganj seat, which went to bsp's account last time
 kshetra se maujuuda basapa vidhayak chandra prakaash mishra hatya ke ek maamle main namjad kiye ja chuke hai or naeem unki raah mushkil kar sakate hai
 The Congress's position on Tiloi seat in Amethi is fine, but the equation of Salon seat can make it difficult for him
 is seat par maujuuda vidhayak or congress ke pratyaashee shivabalak paasi kaa basapa ke vijay ambedkar se kaante kaa muqabla he
 If we look at the electoral scenario of Rae Bareli, the Congress is in control of four of the five seats there, but this time the SP is giving it a strong competition
 raibareli sadar seat par nirdaleey bahubali vidhayak akhilesh singh pichley kareeb 18 saal se kabiz hai
 This time he is the candidate of Peace Party
 congress ne is seat se avadhesh pratap singh ko pratyaashee banaaya he jinke saamne akhilesh ke tilism ko todane kii kathin chunauti he or unhen ‘priyanka magic’ kaa sahaara he
 The incumbent Congress MLA and candidate Shiv Ganesh from Harchandpur seat is getting a tough fight with sp's Surendra Vikram Singh
 yahi haal bachhraavaan kaa he, jahaan sapa pratyaashee raamalaal akelaa congress ummidavaar raja ram tyaagi ke liye kadi chunauti pesh kar rahe hai
 Congress candidate from Sareni seat, Ashok Singh and sp's Devendra Pratap Singh are trying hard
 iske alaava unchaahar seat se congress vidhayak or ummidavaar ajay paal singh ko brahamanon kii kathith upeksha kaa nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he jiskaa phayda sapa pratyaashee manoj kumaar pandeya ko milane ke asaar hai
 Now it remains to be seen whether Priyanka's magic goes up and speaks to the voters of these districts

 general ravat apane pasandida project ke bare main baat karte hai, jisamen sena ko nae sire se dhaalane or sahi aakaar main laane kii itani badi kasarat amuman pehali baar chalaai ja rahi he
 They hope that this will reduce the number and increase the fighting ability of the army
 sena pramukh ek vistrut saakshaatkaar main agxcutive editor sandip unnithan ko dotuk bataa rahe hai ki sena main yah kayapalat kyon vakt kii jarurat he or isse sena ko kaise nayaa rang-rup milegaa
 Here are excerpts from the conversation
 aapane jo sudhaar prakriya shuru kii he, uskaa makasad kya he?iske teen makasad hai—hamaari kshamtaaon ko majboot karke bhavishya ke yudhon ke liye taiyaar hona, zyada chust-durust bananaa or hamaare bajet kaa behatar prabandhan karnaa
 How do you envisage the kind of war that the Indian Army may have to fight in the future? The northern frontiers of India are unstable and to some extent the western frontiers, where an enemy in front of us with Pakistan is with us We have not been able to keep pace
 lihaaja sarhadon par hamen apni maujuudagi banaae rakhni he, ham chaukasee gata nahin sakate
 We need military units, which are our eyes and ears, which have not been deployed on the borders forever, but if such situations arise then stay on the front
 ham maanavbal aadhaarit sena hai
 The second view is that the nature of war is changing
 bhavishya kii jang kaise ladi jaaengi? pehle choti-choti karravaayiyon kii jang hoti thi jo lambii chalati thim or jo tikaa rahata tha vah vijeta hota tha
 Now the war will not be fought in that way
 dushman alahada tareekon se jang ko anjaam denge, aisi jang jinamein koi sampark yaa aamanaa-saamana nahin hoga—sibar jang, manovaigyanik jang or kanoonee jang
 We have to take advantage of technology — space-based systems and long-range surveillance systems
 agar aapako soochnaaon kaa muqabla karnaa he or manovaigyanik jang ladgai he, to aapke sainya balon main aise sanghathan hone chahie jo aise masalon se nipat saken
 Some organizations within the army have become useless
 sahi aakaar main laane kaa yah kaam sainya balon kii kshamtaaon ko majboot karne, unhen zyada chust-durust banane or bhavishya kii jang ke liye taiyaar karne ke liye ho rahaa he
 So where we have to be ready for face-to-face and distant battles, we have to imbibe technology
 ranneeti or dhaanchon ko nai sibar jang or antariksh aadhaarit tatwon ke saath nae sire se sangathit karnaa hoga
 So does this mean that you are not going to get any more money from the government over the current budget allocation? There are schemes which have got the approval of the government and for which assurance has been given
 aisi jaruraton ke liye sarkaar ko hamen rakam deni hogi
 If you are going to come to Rafael tomorrow then you have to pay them
 hamen badi taadaad main hovitger milengi, unke liye rakam muhaiyaa kerani hogi
 By when will the army be ready to face the new challenges? Some changes like the restructuring of the army headquarters will begin immediately
 sibar yuddh or antariksh aadhaarit pranaaliyon ke liye hamen nae vertical kii darkaar he
 Parallel structures so that one agency can talk to another agency
 hamen yah bhi dekhnaa he ki ham duusari do senaaon se apane ko kaise acchhee tarah jodate hai
 The Navy, Army and Air Force are no different in this case
 ham samaan pranaaliyon par kaam kar rahe hai or hamaara antim lakshya samaan he
 If the end goal is shared, then we are asking - why can't we join together? So with this you are going to start the process of coordination? Yes, it also (by restructuring) the process of coordination (with other forces)
 Will begin
 yah ise dekhne kaa hamaara tarika he
 In this way we will also join and will also complete jointmanship
 yah bhi nae sire se dhaalane kii is prakriya kaa hissaa he
 Are other forces coming together? Yes, they are coming
 ham mukhyalayon ke bheetar sanyukt staff rakhane ke prastaavon par aage bad rahe hai
 Having joint staff means that the Headquarters of the Army, Navy and Air Force will have each other's staff
 yah aage kaa rasta he
 At present, there is a Joint Staff ie Integrated Defense Staff (IDS) at Headquarters, but can we not have Joint Staff in Command and Corps? We are investigating this
 mukhyalay main staff rakhana to agle 4-5 maheenon kii samay seemaa main ho jayega
 The Army is working on the concept of Integrated Battle Group (IBG) by combining armored trains, cannons and infantry
 yah kaise kaam karegaa?ibiji ek aisi avadharana he jiske hamen silsilewar pareekshan karne honge
 We are asking the troops to conduct exercises and see how it will work
 hamane unhen ek khaakaa diya he or unhen (uske anuroop) abhyaas yojit karne honge or phir ve sudhaaron ke saath hamaare paas aaenge ki isamen kaise badlaavon kii jarurat he
 We have to look at each IBG keeping in view the given targets, terrain and environment of action
 jab jang ladgaye kii baat aegi to cold start kya ab bhi vikalp he?cold start kya he? cold start khud sakriy hokar behad tej rakrataar se aage baduya he
 It has happened and if you see where we were earlier, all things have progressed
 yah (cold start kaa siddhant) kahata he ki aap tab tak cold start nahin kar sakate jab tak systams ko sarhad par nahin le jate
 It is a continuous thing and is still happening
 aap jin tamaam sudhaaron par jor de rahe hai, kya sarkaar unamem aapke saath he?hamen puri ummid he
 In fact, i speak so impatiently about restructuring, so that everyone knows that something is happening within the army
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki har koi yah baat samajhataa he ki yah hamaare sansadhano ke behatar istemaal, bajet ke behatar prabandhan or dakshata main sudhaar laane ke liye he
 If these three principles are associated with this, then i do not think that there will be any opposition (from the government)
 philhal aapkaa zyaadaatar bajet rajasav kharch main chalaa jaataa he or puunji keval 17 fisadi he
 Have you got a guarantee from the government that if you reduce the expenses of revenue, then you will get more capital? Look at it in reverse
 aaj agar main sainya bal main mahaj 10,000 katautee kar luun, to iskaa matlab hoga 10,000 kam tankhwaahen, 10,000 kam pension
 
 
 So the revenue to capital ratio has changed on its own
 guarantee ek alag masalaa he
 Yes, i am sure that the government will help us
 jab ham unase kahenge ki ‘‘ham aadhe raste aa gaye hai, kya aap bhi taiyaar hai?ʼʼ to mujhe yakeen he ki ve samajhenge
 What will he say about his successors, they support these proposals? That is why i did not do this work alone
 maujuuda army cmanderon ko isamen saath liya he
 Most of them are also living with my successor's colleagues
 maine sevanivrutt diggaj sainikon kii birdari ko bhi saath liya he or unke saath is par charchaa kii he
 This is not something that is being done covertly
 sena main dheron chijen kii gai hai jo sena mukhyalay main faisle liye jane ke baad neeche kii jamaaton tak pahunchi hai
 We are not doing it like this
 aaj har koi jaanata he ki kuch ho rahaa he
 If people feel that this (improvement) is not good, then they should say it clearly now
 is punargathan kii roshni main mountain strike kor kya ab bhi ahm he?haa, yah behad keemtee he
 It is growing
 ham mountain strike kor ko bhi nae sire se dhaal rahe hai, taaki ise zyada se zyada chust or zyada sakasham bana saken
 i think in the mountains you need more agility within the force, the ability to change more quickly
 isliye ise nae sire se dhaalte hue ham iske aakaar main katarbyont kar rahe hai, ham logisticks kii dheron chizon ko kam kar rahe hai
 The country was not so developed in 1962, especially in the outskirts
 aaj ham jo vaahan kharidte hai—maaruti yaa tata—unke bikri centre kii suvidhaayen vahaan sarhad par hi maujuud hai
 
 
 So instead of building repair facilities ourselves, we can take their services directly on the outskirts
 ham bahut sara kaam outsource karne kii soch rahe hai
 Some of our buildings, ordnance factories, base workshops, etc
 
 
 dekhnaa hoga ki kya ham inamen civillian model ko shaamil kar sakate hai
 How many soldiers will be cut, 1,00,000 or more? Figures will finally be known when we finish the process of trials
 aapane jis aankade kaa zikr kiya, vah is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki kitne pareekshan kaamyaab hote hai
 So the last rung desired is that (more than 100,000), but whether we will get there or not, i do not know
 agar hamaare saare pareekshan kaamyaab hote hai, to ham 1,50,000 ke aankade kii taraf dekh rahe hai
 But new additions are also needed
 to jahaan ham bachat kar rahe hai, vahiin isamen se kuch nai badhotariyon main waapas chali jaaengi
 So in the end the figure can be two-thirds of it
 kin badlaavon kii taraf dekh rahe hai?ham afasar kader ke punargathan kii soch rahe hai, promoshan kii sambhaavnaaon ko behatar bananaa chaahate hai
 We have a pyramid-like structure and because of this, one way or the other, it arises in the mind that officers are being left behind
 ham seva sharton main sudhaar laane ke tareekon ko bhi dekh rahe hai
 a young man comes to the army at the age of 18–20 and works for 15 years, then returns home, earning a pension
 ham dekh rahe hai ki kya use 35-37 saal ke baad bhi rakh sakate hai
 Today the life of our population is getting longer due to better health care
