 He said that the meeting with meat traders has been positive and illegal slaughterhouses will not get relief
 saath hi unhone kaha ki sarkaar sabhi virgon ko dhyaan main rakhkar kaam kar rahi he

 Prime Minister Narendra (narendra Modi) is going to once again sit on the post of Prime Minister of the country for five years with a strong majority in the Lok Sabha elections
 is baar ke chunaav main unki party bhartiya janata party (BJP) ko pichley loksabhaa chunaav 2014 (282) se zyada (303) siten mili hai
 This time under the leadership of BJP, NDA has won 351 out of 542 Lok Sabha seats
 jeet ke baad pradhanmantri modi ne endie ke saansadon ko sambodhit kiya
 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Shivanand Tiwari has written a Facebook post on his address
 apni post main tiwari ne kaha ki loksabhaa kaa pichhlaa chunaav jeetne ke baad narendra bhai modi jab pehali martabaa sansad bhawan main pravesh kar rahe the unhone uske choukhat par maathaa teka tha
 This time he bowed his head on the book of the Constitution
 pradhanmantri ne kal (shanivaar) endie (NDA) ke saansadon ko sambodhit karte hue kuch acchhee bhi baaten bhi kahi
 If they are implemented then it will be very auspicious for the country
 apane sambodhan main unhone kaha ki 'vaani se, bartaav se or aacharan se aapako apane ko badalanaa hoga
 'the other important thing that he said is that' they have been isolated in the mind of the minorities, they are being used as vote banks
 unke man se us dar ko nikaal kar sabko saath lekar chalanaa hoga
 'after this, Tiwari writes in his post,' Gandhiji used to say that 'there can be innumerable idle thoughts in our brain
 lekin ve nirjeev andon kii tarah hote hai
 They have no value
 lekin ek hi sakriy vichaar yadi hriday kii gaharaai se nikle
 One who is basically pure and full of the full power of life can become active and dynamic and can create history
 'tiwari likhte hai, 'narendra bhai modi ji ne apane bhaashan main jo vichaar vyakt kiye hai ve sakriy hai yaa niskriy ! lohia inke evaz main sagun or nirgun shabd kaa istemaal karte the
 In Indian politics, there are more things which are passive or absent
 pradhanmantri ji ke kal ke bhaashan ko agar unke pichley kaarykaal kii prishthbhumi main dekha jaae to ve nirgun lagate hai
 But only when he woke up kal jo unhone kaha usko sagun rup diya ja rahaa he yaa nahin isko parakhane kii kasuti kya hogi ! pehali kasuti pragna thakur ko le kar banaai ja sakati he
 Because, for the statement that Pragya Thakur made reference to Nathuram Godse and Mahatma Gandhi, the Prime Minister used harsh words like 'hatred'
 unhone kaha tha ki us bayaan se unako ghrinaa hui he or pragna thakur ko ve is bayaan ke liye kabhi maaf nahin karenge
 Meanwhile, Pragya has also come to Parliament after winning the election
 unako lekar pradhanmantri ji ab kya karenge ? kya apni baat ko sagun rup dene ke liye party se pragna thakur ko alag karne kii dridhtaa dikhaa paayenge ? pradhanmantri ji kaa bhaashan niskriy yaa nirgun tha yaa sachmuch usko ve sakriy yaa sagun rup dena chaahate hai yah jaanchne ke liye ek kasuti yah bhi ho sakati he
 Further Tiwari writes, 'the second criterion can be made in the context of removing fear from the minds of minorities
 dar vaali baat sahi he
 They are used as a vote bank by taking advantage of the fear, this charge of the Prime Minister also has merit, but this fear is from whom! Who are scaring them! In his address he has not made it clear
 mujhe lagata he ki alpsankhyakon ke man main dar kii badi vajah samaaj main unke viruddh failaai ja rahi nafrat se he
 Who is spreading hate? Does the Prime Minister need to tell this! The extent is that they will rape their women by taking them out of the grave, it has even been said! Who has said this, does the Prime Minister need to tell this also? If you want three yards of land for burial, then say Vande Mataram! a member in the Prime Minister's cabinet says so
 aisa kehane kaa saahas inamen kahan se aata he! aisa isliye ki unako lagata he ki pradhanmantri ji aisi bhashaa pasand karte hai
 They are not wrong either
 aisa hi bolte mantri ban gaye
 The riot accused are also included in the cabinet
 'apni post ke aakhir main unhone likhaa, 'isliye pradhanmantri ji ne apane bhaashan main kal jo kuch kaha he uske prati ve vaaqai gambhir hai or unako sakriy or sagun rup dena chaahate he to uski shuruuaat do chote qadamon se ve kar sakate hai
 First, by removing Pragya Thakur from his party and second by keeping the members who spew poison against the minorities out of the cabinet
 ye do chote qadam bada sandesh denge or pradhanmantri ji alpsankhyakon ko votbank se mukt karne kii disha main aage bad sakenge
 This path can also be extended to the direction towards which our Constitution directs

 desh kii pehali tram mumbai main saal1873 main parel se kolaba ke bich chali thi, lekin kuch saalon pehle bhaagti daudti mumbai ke saath tram daud nahin pai or use band karnaa padaa
 Now there is a plan to run the tram in the city once again
 mumbai main tram ko phir se chalaane kaa sapana saamne rakhaa he kendriya paryaavaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne
 The tram is also planned to be included in the multi-model corridor of the coastal road to be constructed from Nariman Point to Kandivali
 paryaavaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha "hamen suzav mili hai ki agar costal road ko sirf nijee vaahanon ke liye banaaya jayega to ye trephic kii samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hoga, isliye hamaari koshish hogi iske aasapaas metro, tram chalaane kii
 Electric trams can run faster
 "tippaniyan At present, trams in the country are running only in Kolkata, but tram service was restored in Mumbai till the 60s
 mumbai main pehali tram parel se kolaba tak chalaai gai thi, lekin us vakt tram ko ghode khinchate the, takreeban 30 saal baad shahar main bijli se chalane vaali tram daudi
 Double decker trams were also used
 jaankaron kaa bhi maananaa he ki mumbai jaise bheed-bhaad vaale shahar main tram public transport kaa acha or sasta vikalp ho saktaa he
 According to traffic expert Ashoka Datar, "I think, the tram is great for a crowded city like Mumbai
 chunki patari ke bich kam jagah lagati he, isliye ye biarties ke mukaable bhi behatar he
 Trams are running in cities like Vienna, Amsterdam, Prague
 " Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar has set the dream of running the tram in Mumbai again
 nariman point se kandiwali tak banane vaale costal road ke multi model coridor main tram ko bhi shaamil karne kii yojana he
 Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said, "we have received suggestions that if the coastal road is made for private vehicles only, then it will not solve the traffic problem, so we will try to run the metro and tram around it
" electric tram tezi se daud sakati he
 "comments philhal desh main tram sirf kolkata main chal rahi hai, lekin mumbai main bhi 60 ke dashak tak tram seva behaal thi
 The first tram in Mumbai was run from Parel to Colaba, but at that time the tram was pulled by horses, after about 30 years an electric tram ran into the city
 dabl dekar traamon kaa bhi prayog hua
 Experts also believe that trams can be a good and cheap alternative to public transport in a crowded city like Mumbai
 trephic export ashoka daataar ke mutabik "mujhe lagata he, tram mumbai jaise bheed-bhaad vaale shahar ke liye bahut acha he

 shaayad sabase ahm pahalu yah he ki china ke paas pakistan ke ranneetik rup se gwadaar port tak pahunch he, jo 46 arab america dollar kii laagat se ban rahe china-pakistan aarthik galiyare (china-pakistan iconomic coridor) kaa hissaa he, or iske alaava china ne khud bhi horn of africa main jibooti stesan par haal hi main nausainik adda banaaya he

 Perhaps the most important aspect is that China has access to Pakistan's strategically located Gwadar Port, which is part of the sino-pakistan Economic Corridor (china-pakistan Economic Corridor) at a cost of US $ 46 billion, and furthermore China itself has recently built a naval base at the Djibouti station in the Horn of Africa

 He said this while talking to reporters on his 49th birthday on Sunday
 king khan ne kaha ki aalochanaon ko lekar sakht ravaiya apnaane ke bajaay centre sarkaar ko kam se kam do saal tak kaa samay dena chahie
 He said that he has an absolute majority in democracy and this in itself is a big win
 isliye pehle unhen samarthan dekar 6 maheene baad hi media un par bandook taan le, yah thik nahin he
 Shahrukh Khan said, 'everyone has good intentions

 Now, the matter may catch up when the contact between the two is detected
 bataa den ki isse pehle bihar main samaaj kalyaan mantri manju verma ke pati or brijesh thakur ke bich janvari se ab tak 17 baar phone par baatcheet hui thi
 This has been revealed by the call detail of Brijesh Thakur, the main accused in the Muzaffarpur Girls' Home Scandal case

 The IOA, which has been opposing the bill from the beginning, urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to set up a Group of Ministers to resolve the issue
 uske is kadam ko is masale ko khel mantri ke haathon se baahar nikaalane kaa prayaas mana ja rahaa he
 Maken, however, made it clear that he would not let the bill go by hand and would talk to his cabinet colleagues
 maakan ne kaha, mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki main un logon se is par baat karne main safal rahoonga jo iskaa virodh kar rahe hai kyonki main ek baat par saaf hum ki hamaara iraadaa niyantran bananaa yaa ghuspaith karnaa nahin he

 He said, IOA and NSF officials are feeling suffocated by the baseless campaign being conducted against us by some vested bodies
 is galat abhiyaan ke kaaran hamaari landan olympic kii taiyaariyaan prabhavit ho rahi hai
 Malhotra said, the wrong impression is being created in the minds of the general public that the IOA is against every move of the government
 yah sahi nahin he
 Committed to tidy up the management system of sports institutions and bring transparency and accountability in them, Maken said that his effort is to stop any other scam like the Commonwealth Games
 unhone virodhiyon kii is baat ko nakaar diya ki vah yah vidheyak isliye laa rahe hai taaki khel sansthaaon par sarkaar kaa niyantran ho jaae
 He said that he is ready to work again on certain conditions but these do not include the conditions related to transparency and accountability

 Shilpa wrote along with the photo, My mother often says that when you are a big personality, never complain and never give clarification
 abhinetri ne saath hi kaha ki galatfahami paidaa ho gai
 Although she praises 'animal Farm', she never read this book
 unhone saath hi kaha, 
 
 isliye bacchon ko yah padhane kii salaah dene kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Certainly there has been some misunderstanding
 
 i do not want to go into that

 Significantly, the Council of School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) has decided to include the Harry Potter Series in the English curriculum of junior and secondary school students from the year 2017-2018

 In response, Shilpa said that the move to include Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter in the syllabus is very good
 unhone saath hi ‘animal farm’ kii yah kehete hue sifarish kii thi ki yah bacchon ko pashuon se prem karnaa sikhayega
 It was only after this statement that the hash tag started trending on Twitter and people started mocking him with other books
 tippaniyan Shilpa tweeted several tweets one after another about the case

 It was only after this statement that the hash tag started trending on Twitter and people started mocking him with other books

 ) The bjp's West Bengal unit said on Tuesday that the party had no connection with the deaths that were allegedly caused by the fear that the National Register of Citizens (NRC) could be implemented in the state
 bhaajapa kii rajya ikai ke adhyaksh dilip ghosh (dilip Ghosh) ne daawa kiya ki yahaan tak ki dengue se hui mauton ko bhi NRC ko lekar khauf se hui mautein bataaya ja rahaa he
 Ghosh, however, said that if he comes to power, he will implement the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state to rid 'bangladeshi Muslim infiltrators'
 unhone yahaan patrakaron se kaha, 'hamane NRC ko lekar koi khauf paidaa nahin kiya
 It is unfair to hold us responsible
 bhaajapa ne assam main NRC lagu nahin kii
 This was done as per the orders of the Supreme Court
 'duusari ore pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri or trinmul congress supremeo mamata banerjee ne somvaar ko bhaajapa par NRC ko lekar khauf paidaa karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha tha ki iske chalate rajya main chah logon kii maut hui he
 However, earlier during the meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah last week, he said that NRC is not required in West Bengal like Assam
 us mulaakaat ne 19 un lakh logon kii ore dhyaan dilaayaa tha, jinamein se kai 'vaastavik voter' hai, jinka naam assam main kaha ki assam ke naagarik register main shaamil nahin kiye gaye
 Mamta Banerjee told Amit Shah that West Bengal does not need an NRC like Assam
 bataa den ki assam main naagarik register, jisamen se 19 lakh logon ke naam hataa die gaye hai, lagu kiye jane ko kadi aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Even some BJP leaders in the state criticized it, claiming that many Bengali Hindus were removed from the list, who were part of the party's core voter group
 jiesti main sarkaar compojit skim ke tahat karadaataaon ko badi raahat de sakati he
 After the meeting of the Group of Ministers held in Delhi, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi has given information that hotel restaurants, manufactures and traders can benefit under this Composite Scheme
 assam ke vitt mantri hemanth vishwasharma kii adhyakshata main yojit mantri samooh ne kar main raahat dene kii anushansa kii he, lekin antim faisla 10 november ko hone vaalisticouncil kii baithak main liya jayega
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said that in the meeting, the limit of Composite Scheme was increased from 1 Crore to 1
5 Crore, as well as 1% to 2% on gross sales to the manufacturers involved in the Composite, 1% instead of 5 for Restaurants and Traders
 0 instead of 1
 5 pratishat kar bhugtan kaa suzav diya gaya he
 At the same time, the compounding dealer who does not pay any tax on the sale of tax-free goods, has been recommended to pay 1 percent tax on the sale of taxed goods
 compounding skim main shaamil menuphactures or treders ko antar rajya bikri kii anumati dene kaa suzav diya gaya he
 With an input tax credit of 12 per cent for all AC and nonac restaurants, and a recommended 18 per cent tax rate for five star hotels, all types of taxpayers have been suggested to submit monthly tax payments and quarterly returns
 mantri samooh ne ritern echesen code or invais maiching kii sarleekaran kii, jahaan anushansa kii he, vahiin vilamb se vivarani daakhil karne waalon ke liye vilamb shulk kii raashi ko pratidin 200 rupee se gata kar 50 rupee karne kaa suzav diya he
 Ramlila committee cuts, committees forced to reduce expenses will not be bought for ram-sita Dress festival is celebrated across the country with great pomp, Ramlila is organized all over the country before Dussehra
 lekin aarthik mandi ke asar ne is tyohaar kii chamak ko bhi feekaa kar diya he
 Due to the recession, Ramlila organizers have cut back to a higher level
 dilli main 28 sitambar se ramlila shuru hone vaali he
 Ramlila committees say that the cost of artist, stage and event is increasing
 puraani dilli ke laal kile maidan par lav-kush ramlila cameti desh kii sabase puraani cametiyon main se he
 According to Arjun Kumar Gupta, General Secretary of the Lav Kush Ramlila Committee, traders are unable to donate to the Ramlila committees due to the recession
 arjuna kumaar bataate hai ki pichley saal jahaan lav kush ramlila cameti ne 5000 member banaae the abaki baar sirf 12 sau member hi ban paae hai
 This is having an impact on the Chanda collection
 cameti kaa kahana he ki vyapaaree chanda dene se hichkicha rahe hai
 Arjun Kumar said that every year a Ram procession procession is organized which consists of 50 tableaux, this time there will be only 25 tableaux in the Sobha Yatra
 iske alaava jo kalakaar jo ram, ravan, sita kaa kirdaar nibhaate hai unke liye nai dress nahin kharidi gai he
 These artists will work only with the old dress
 aatishbaajee kaa kharch bhi kam kiya gaya he
 The committees that used to burn effigy against terrorism earlier are talking about burning effigy of inflation this time
 pichley 26 saal se indraprastha ramlila cameti kaa aayojan karne vaale suresh bindal kaa kahana he ki jab arthvyavastha chalaane vaale vyapaariyon ke paas hi paisa nahin he to aise main wo chanda kya degaa? ramlila cametiyon kaa kahana he ki chanda bhale hi kam mil rahaa ho lekin kharche kam nahin ho paa rahe hai jisaki vajah se jamaa puunji ko nikaalnaa pad rahaa he
 According to Bhagwat Rastogi, the head of Balaji Ramlila Committee, which is included in Hitech Ramlila in East Delhi, it is a very difficult task to raise, decorate, choose new themes, to attract more and more crowd, but this time of recession The reason is to think everything
 ramlila kii bhavyata kam kii gai he taaki kharche kam kiye ja sake
 This time, Hanuman bringing Sanjeevani Boots by helicopter or killing Sita by Ravana through big trains, all this time will not be seen in Ramlila in hi-tech way
 pichley kai saalon se ramlila main ravan kaa putala banane vaale ikbaal ne bataaya ki mahangaai bad gai he ki lekin unke kaam kaa daam nahin badha he
 Iqbal said that he has to make an effigy of Ravana at the same rate as last year
 sienen par brussels aatankwaadi hamale kii report dekh kar zaraa der ke liye thahar gaya
 As soon as the break came the advertisement of a CCTV company started
 mere paas adhikrut soochna nahin he ki sisitivi camere kaa yah vigyaapan pehle se hi aa rahaa tha yaa hamale ke baad aane laga he
 Even if this is a coincidence, and if the advertisements have started coming after the attack, then we should also know what is the role of CCTV in preventing terrorism
 main na to sisitivi footage kaa visheshgy hum or na hi aatankwaadi hamalon kaa
 Still, what is wrong with questioning is whether the CCTV camera is used to gather evidence after the attack or to prevent terrorist attacks
 in camaron se ham kya khaas saboot jutate hai, jo aage ke hamalon ko rokane main hamaari madad karata he
 We are able to stop or just be satisfied with what the Humalwara looked like and who it was
 aapane dekha hoga in dinon kisi bhi aatankwaadi hamale ke baad hazaron news channelon par sisitivi footage chalane lagata he
 Things are scattered at the scene and people are rushing to disgrace
 thodi der main hamalavar kii tasviir bhi aa jaati he or uskaa huliya duniya bhar ke channelon par chalane lagata he
 The name even comes to know who is there and where it has come from
 yah sab zaruri suchanaaen to hai or inke zariye kaaphi kuch pataa chalata bhi he, lekin iske baad bhi to aglaa hamalaa ho hi jaataa he
 Now who has come to die, why would he worry about CCTV for his later evidence
 koi suraksha visheshgy hi paryaapt udaahranon se bataa saktaa he ki sisitivi camere ke footage se ham kya hasil kar rahe hai
 It may be beneficial in accidents and other cases, but it will be interesting to know how effective it is in preventing terrorism
 aap google karenge to sisitivi banane or bechney vaali tamaam companiyon or vitarakon ke naam upar aa jate hai
 Their total business will also be worth thousands of crores
 yah dekha janaa chahie ki kya aatankwaadi hamale ke baad sisitivi camere kaa kaarobaar badhata he
 Now people install CCTV in their homes and shops to avoid thieves
 sarkaar or janata jamkar is par paise kharch kar rahi he or ham tex de rahe hai ki sarkaar police ke zariye hamaari suraksha karegi
 Also paying taxes and installing CCTV
 kya sisitivi sipaahi kaa vikalp he? kya sisitivi camere se aatankwaad ko rokane main madad mili he? kya sisitivi camere se chori or anya vaardaat ko rokane main madad mili he
 We keep reading the news that the thieves ran away with the ATM machine even after CCTV cameras were installed
 kuch chor zarur pakade jate hai, magar chori to tab bhi ho hi rahi he
 Gold and silver are also stolen from the shop and footage is found to run the channels
 ho saktaa he iske aadhaar par baad main chor pakadaa bhi jaataa hoga, lekin ham aankadon ke rup main jaanate hai yaa hamaari sari jaankaree ho saktaa he aankadon par aadhaarit hoti he
 Within a short time of the explosion within the Brussels airport, the post-explosion photos from TV centers around the world start playing
 dhamaake ke kaaran cement se lekar shishe ke tukade bikhare pade hai
 People are running out of disgrace
 aisi tasviren ab ham har hamale ke baad dekhte hai
 These pictures create panic fear around the world, but also create a market of fear
 sisitivi footage ko aatankwaad virdohi ladaai kaa ek mahatvapurn sahyogi maan liya jaataa he
 It seems that as long as there is CCTV, one cannot run away
 lekin aap dhyaan se dekhiye, koun bhaag rahaa he? aam log yaa aatankwaadi
 
 
 Attack is suicidal
 vah vahiin maar kar mar jaataa he
 Running is a common man, in view of which we tremble in panic
 zarur aatankwaadiyon kii tasviir bhi aa jaati he
 Sometimes they look two, sometimes they look three
 unka naam pataa chal jaataa he
 His huliya is shown on thousands of TV channels
 vaise hi jaise railway steshnon or bas addon par gumshuda logon se lekar aatankwaadiyon kii tasviren chipka di jaati hai
 It becomes difficult to find out who is a terrorist and who has run away from home
 yah bhi jaankaree aati he ki ye aatankwaadi kis jagah se chale the or kis taxi main baith the
 There is a lot of analysis, but no one tells us which battle we are fighting, which is not able to stop terrorism
 jab duniya ke tamaam taqatvar mulk rose elaan karte hai ki ve aatankwaad se lard rahe hai to is ladaai kaa nateeja kya he
 Sometimes the field is Iraq, sometimes it is Syria
 aatankwaadi apni jagah chunate hai or aaraam se hamalaa kar jate hai
 So, were statements made in the name of fighting terrorism or did anything happen
 in ghatnaon ke sandarbh main kuch thos to hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 All the airports of the world remain sensitive to the risk of terrorism, so much investigation is done that one does not feel like traveling by air
 phir bhi brussels kii ghatana ho gai
 In India too, there is a lot of talk of CCTV to avoid terrorist attack or attack
 26 november 2011 ke mumbai hamale ke baad mumbai main sisitivi camaron kii tainaati ko lekar khub vaade hue
 The government then made a few announcements by making a committee vote, but for four years there was no significant progress
 15 may, 2015 kii times of india kii khabar se pataa chalata he ki bijepi-shivasena kii sarkaar ne faisla kiya he ki sitambar 2016 tak mumbai main 6600 se adhik sisitivi camere laga die jaaenge
 It will cost about nine and a half crores
 dilli main bhi aatankwaadi hamalon or nirbhaya cond ke baad sisitivi camere par kaaphi vishwaas jataayaa gaya tha
 According to the India Today news of 17 January 2015, the Delhi High Court has drawn the Center and the Delhi government that you installed 15,000 cctvs in the city of Delhi for Barack Obama, but not for citizens
 ab sochie agar obama ke aagaman ke liye kuch hafton ke bheetar dilli main 15000 sisitivi camere lagaae ja sakate hai, to 26 november 2011 ke hamale ke baad 6600 se adhik sisitivi camere lagane main paanch saal kyon lagate hai
 This means that if the governments want, they can install all the cameras within a week
 vaise 15000 sisitivi camere lagane kaa kitna karcha aayaa hoga? The Times of India reported on 20 May 2015 that the Delhi Police told the court that it wanted to install more than 6 thousand cameras in 44 serious crime areas, which would cost more than 400 crores
 adaalat ne yah kahkar inkaar kar diya ki vah anumati nahin de sakati, kyonki unhen is bajet main kamai kii manshaa nazar aati he
 Now you see
 mumbai main bhi 6000 se adhik sisitivi camere lagane hai, lekin vahaan kaa bajet he 949 karod
 There is also talk of installing more than 6000 CCTV cameras in Delhi and there is a budget of 400 crores
 mumbai kaa bajet dugana! ye sab main akhbaaron kii report ke aadhaar par likh rahaa hum
 By the way, one should also know what is the budget of CCTV in every state and the cost per camera
 zaahir he aatankwaad se ladane ke naam par camaron se zyaada camaron ke naam par hone vaali kamai kii zyaada chintaa kii jaati he
 The comments mail online india par 25 may 2013 ko chhapi ek khabar se hamen prati camere laagat kaa thodaa sa andaaza ho saktaa he
 According to the news, Delhi Police has informed the right to information activist Harpal Singh Rana that 1337 CCTV cameras have been installed, which cost 68 crores
 nai dilli municipal corporation ne soochna di he ki usne apane kshetra main 53 camere lagaae hai jin par ek karod 2 lakh kaa kharchaa aayaa he, yani ek camere par 2 lakh 30 hazaar kaa kharch aayaa he
 If you carefully multiply the division, then the difference in the estimate of installing CCTV of different departments will be visible
 sisitivi camera ek mahatvapurn upkaran to he or isaki bhoomika ko nakaarne kii bevakoofi nahin karnaa chahta, lekin isaki kamyaabi or laagat ko lekar sawaal karnaa bevakoofi nahin hogi
 Is CCTV industry benefiting from terrorism or is CCTV stopping terrorism? If there is a solid answer to this question, will there be any loss

 yah bhi jaankaree aati he ki ye aatankwaadi kis jagah se chale the or kis taxi main baith the
 There is a lot of analysis, but no one tells us which battle we are fighting, which is not able to stop terrorism
 jab duniya ke tamaam taqatvar mulk rose elaan karte hai ki ve aatankwaad se lard rahe hai to is ladaai kaa nateeja kya he
 Sometimes the field is Iraq, sometimes it is Syria
 aatankwaadi apni jagah chunate hai or aaraam se hamalaa kar jate hai
 So, were statements made in the name of fighting terrorism or did anything happen

 26 november 2011 ke mumbai hamale ke baad mumbai main sisitivi camaron kii tainaati ko lekar khub vaade hue
 The government then made a few announcements by making a committee vote, but for four years there was no significant progress
 15 may, 2015 kii times of india kii khabar se pataa chalata he ki bijepi-shivasena kii sarkaar ne faisla kiya he ki sitambar 2016 tak mumbai main 6600 se adhik sisitivi camere laga die jaaenge
 It will cost about nine and a half crores
 dilli main bhi aatankwaadi hamalon or nirbhaya cond ke baad sisitivi camere par kaaphi vishwaas jataayaa gaya tha
 According to the India Today news of 17 January 2015, the Delhi High Court has drawn the Center and the Delhi government that you installed 15,000 cctvs in the city of Delhi for Barack Obama, but not for citizens
 ab sochie agar obama ke aagaman ke liye kuch hafton ke bheetar dilli main 15000 sisitivi camere lagaae ja sakate hai, to 26 november 2011 ke hamale ke baad 6600 se adhik sisitivi camere lagane main paanch saal kyon lagate hai
 This means that if the governments want, they can install all the cameras within a week
 vaise 15000 sisitivi camere lagane kaa kitna karcha aayaa hoga? The Times of India reported on 20 May 2015 that the Delhi Police told the court that it wanted to install more than 6 thousand cameras in 44 serious crime areas, which would cost more than 400 crores
 adaalat ne yah kahkar inkaar kar diya ki vah anumati nahin de sakati, kyonki unhen is bajet main kamai kii manshaa nazar aati he
 Now you see
 mumbai main bhi 6000 se adhik sisitivi camere lagane hai, lekin vahaan kaa bajet he 949 karod
 There is also talk of installing more than 6000 CCTV cameras in Delhi and there is a budget of 400 crores
 mumbai kaa bajet dugana! ye sab main akhbaaron kii report ke aadhaar par likh rahaa hum
 By the way, one should also know what is the budget of CCTV in every state and the cost per camera

 According to the news, Delhi Police has informed the right to information activist Harpal Singh Rana that 1337 CCTV cameras have been installed, which cost 68 crores
 nai dilli municipal corporation ne soochna di he ki usne apane kshetra main 53 camere lagaae hai jin par ek karod 2 lakh kaa kharchaa aayaa he, yani ek camere par 2 lakh 30 hazaar kaa kharch aayaa he
 If you carefully multiply the division, then the difference in the estimate of installing CCTV of different departments will be visible
 sisitivi camera ek mahatvapurn upkaran to he or isaki bhoomika ko nakaarne kii bevakoofi nahin karnaa chahta, lekin isaki kamyaabi or laagat ko lekar sawaal karnaa bevakoofi nahin hogi
 Is CCTV industry benefiting from terrorism or is CCTV stopping terrorism? If there is a solid answer to this question, will there be any loss
 kya sisitivi sipaahi kaa vikalp he? kya sisitivi camere se aatankwaad ko rokane main madad mili he? kya sisitivi camere se chori or anya vaardaat ko rokane main madad mili he
 We keep reading the news that the thieves ran away with the ATM machine even after CCTV cameras were installed
 kuch chor zarur pakade jate hai, magar chori to tab bhi ho hi rahi he
 Gold and silver are also stolen from the shop and footage is found to run the channels
 ho saktaa he iske aadhaar par baad main chor pakadaa bhi jaataa hoga, lekin ham aankadon ke rup main jaanate hai yaa hamaari sari jaankaree ho saktaa he aankadon par aadhaarit hoti he
 Within a short time of the explosion within the Brussels airport, the post-explosion photos from TV centers around the world start playing
 dhamaake ke kaaran cement se lekar shishe ke tukade bikhare pade hai
 People are running out of disgrace
 aisi tasviren ab ham har hamale ke baad dekhte hai
 These pictures create panic fear around the world, but also create a market of fear
 sisitivi footage ko aatankwaad virdohi ladaai kaa ek mahatvapurn sahyogi maan liya jaataa he
 It seems that as long as there is CCTV, one cannot run away
 lekin aap dhyaan se dekhiye, koun bhaag rahaa he? aam log yaa aatankwaadi
 
 
 Attack is suicidal

 We now see such pictures after every attack

 CCTV footage is considered an important ally of the anti-terrorism fight
 aisa lagata he ki jab tak sisitivi he, tab tak koi bhaag kar nahin ja saktaa
 But you look carefully, who is running? Common people or terrorists

 Surely the picture of terrorists also comes

 iske liye kareeb saadhe nau so karod kaa karcha aayega
 After the terrorist attacks and the Nirbhaya incident in Delhi too, a lot of confidence was raised on the CCTV camera

 Now imagine if 15000 CCTV cameras can be installed in Delhi within a few weeks for Obama's arrival, why does it take five years to install more than 6600 CCTV cameras after the 26 November 2011 attack
 iskaa matlab he ki sarkarein chahen to hafte bhar ke bheetar saare camere laga sakati hai
 By the way, how much would it cost to install 15,000 CCTV cameras? times of india kii 20 may 2015 kii khabar he ki dilli police ne adaalat se kaha ki 44 gambhir aparaadh kshetron main vah 6 hazaar se adhik camera lagaana chaahati he, jiskaa kharchaa 400 karod se adhik aayega

 According to the news, Delhi Police has informed the right to information activist Harpal Singh Rana that 1337 CCTV cameras have been installed, which cost 68 crores
 nai dilli municipal corporation ne soochna di he ki usne apane kshetra main 53 camere lagaae hai jin par ek karod 2 lakh kaa kharchaa aayaa he, yani ek camere par 2 lakh 30 hazaar kaa kharch aayaa he
 If you carefully multiply the division, then the difference in the estimate of installing CCTV of different departments will be visible

 Is CCTV industry benefiting from terrorism or is CCTV stopping terrorism? If there is a solid answer to this question, will there be any loss
 times of india kii 20 may 2015 kii khabar he ki dilli police ne adaalat se kaha ki 44 gambhir aparaadh kshetron main vah 6 hazaar se adhik camera lagaana chaahati he, jiskaa kharchaa 400 karod se adhik aayega
 The court refused, stating that she could not give permission, as she sees the intention of earning in this budget
 ab aap dekhiye
 Mumbai also has more than 6000 CCTV cameras, but the budget there is 949 crores
 dilli main bhi 6000 se adhik sisitivi camere lagane kii baat hoti he or vahaan kaa bajet he 400 karod
 Mumbai's budget doubled! i am writing all these on the basis of newspaper reports 
 vaise yah bhi jaananaa chahie ki har rajya main sisitivi kaa bajet kya he or prati camera laagat kya he
 It is obvious that in the name of fighting terrorism, more money is generated in the name of cameras than on cameras
 tippaniyan a news report on Mail Online India on 25 May 2013 may give us a slight idea of the cost per camera
 khabar ke anusaar soochna ke adhikaar kaaryakarta harpal singh rana ko dilli police ne jaankaree di he ki 1337 sisitivi camere lagaae hai, jin par 68 karod kii laagat ai he
 New Delhi Municipal Corporation has reported that it has installed 53 cameras in its area, which has cost Rs 1 crore 2 lakh, that is, 2 lakh 30 thousand has been spent on one camera
 agar aap saavdhaanee se guna bhaag karenge to alag-alag vibhaagon ke sisitivi lagane ke anumaan main antar saaf dikh jayega
 The CCTV camera is an important device and does not want to be fooled to deny its role, but it would not be foolish to question its success and cost
 aatankwaad se sisitivi udyog ko phayda ho rahaa he yaa sisitivi se aatankwaad ruk rahaa he? is sawaal par agar thos jawaab mil jaae to kya koi nuksaan ho jayega
 Now you see
 mumbai main bhi 6000 se adhik sisitivi camere lagane hai, lekin vahaan kaa bajet he 949 karod
 There is also talk of installing more than 6000 CCTV cameras in Delhi and there is a budget of 400 crores
 mumbai kaa bajet dugana! ye sab main akhbaaron kii report ke aadhaar par likh rahaa hum
 By the way, one should also know what is the budget of CCTV in every state and the cost per camera

 Dakshin Chara's film Sameer was released in September 2017
 ye film aatankwaad ke plot par aadhaarit thi
 Chara claimed that the film Accidental Prime Minister clearly showed the flags of politicians, political parties and parties, but was also asked to remove the small political references used in his film
 unke mutabik, "unhen anupam kher or akshay khanna kii film se koi dikkat nahin he, lekin ve sibiefasi se jaananaa chaahate hai ki pichley saal ai unki film ke kai drishyon par aakhir kanchi kyon chalaai gai?"gauratlab he ki film 'samir' ko sensor board kii ekzamining kamity ne 28 farvari 2017 ko rivyuu kiya tha
 After watching the film, the screening committee had decided to put several cuts in the film
 dakshin ne bataaya ki 'kamity kaa kahana tha ki film se bijepi ke jhande vaala shot or 'al jajira' shabd ko hataa liya jaae
 Apart from this, 'mann Ki Baat' was used during a dialogue in the film, he was also asked to remove it
 board kaa kahana tha ki ye piem ke radio sho kaa naam he or ise istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Not only this, in the film, a dialogue 'delhi ki rasta jaapi ki jaapta hai' was also asked to be cut because this dialogue had political undertones
 iske alaava bhi kamity ne kai hinsak drishyon ko hataane ke liye kaha tha

 It is being told that the terrorist organization Islamic State has taken responsibility for this attack
 aise hua tha hamalamaiahoor landan brij par shanivaar der raat ek tejaraftaar vine ne rahgeeron ko kuchal diya

 Even if Manmohan Singh had not become the Prime Minister of the country, he would have been as big a man as he is today
 koi bhi insaan un kaamon ko nazarandaaj nahin kar saktaa, jo unhone kiye hai
 He is a global figure and his economic policies have been read around the world

 a well-known female property dealer was murdered in Mirzapur city of Uttar Pradesh
 mahila kii laash uske ghar se hi baraamad hui he
 Police is investigating the case
 hatya kii yah sansanikhej vaardaat mirzapur nagar kotwali thana kshetra kii he
 Where Mahilamina Singh, who lives in Vijaypur Kothi area, was working as a property for a long time
 shahar ke sabase posh ilaake main rahane vaali mahila kii laash buudhvaar ko uske kamare se baraamad hui
 The corpse was discovered when the housekeeper entered the room to work
 usne ghatana jaankaree turant police ko di
 When the police went to the scene, Meena's body was found on the floor of the room
 laash dekhne se lag rahaa tha ki minaa ke munh main kapadaa thuns kar uskaa galaa dabaaya gaya he
 The police came to know that there was no robbery in the house
 isliye pulicehatyake is maamle main mahila ke kisi jaankaar kaa haath hone kii ashanka jataa kar rahi he
 Police are looking at property dispute as the reason for the murder in this case
 kyonki pichley 20 saalon se mahila shahar main praparty kharidne bechney kaa kaam kar rahi thi
 He has also had a dispute with many people in this regard
 philhal police is maamle kii jaanch main juty he
 There was no significant opposition in parliamentary politics over 10 percent reservation for economically weaker sections of all religions and castes
 ab aate hai virodh ke un pahaluon par jo rose desh ke kisi na kisi hisse main ho rahaa hota he magar unke liye koi bhi dal saamne nahin aata he
 It has not happened till today from all types of governments to give a transparent and honest examination system on which everyone can trust
 buniyadi samasya kaa samaadhaan chhod kar har samay ek bade or aasaan mudde kii talash ne lakhon kii sankhya main naujavaanon ko tod diya he
 Easier to say that there was no specific protest in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha regarding reservation
 aarakshan ke virodhiyon ko aarakshan mila he yah acchhee baat he lekin aarakshan kaa laabh mili iske liye system kab thik hoga
 Why this question could not become a major reason why the process of job restoration is corrupt
 ye kab thik hogi
 On 20 March 2017, AIDMK MP Elumalai Velligounder questioned Prakash Javadekar about what steps are being taken to improve the ratio of student and teachers at Central University, to fill vacant posts
 jiske jawaab main maanav sansaadhan mantri ne kaha tha ki yah lagaataar chalane vaali niti he
 Within a year, we will be able to administer all 9000 adhoc teachers studying in Delhi University
 balki yah bhi kaha ki hamane is samasya kaa samaadhaan kar liya he
 Only Prakash Javadekar can tell whether all 9000 posts have been filled or not
 bhare gaye hote to guest teacher or edock shikshak dharna nahin dete
 It is also not easy to picket for them
 vetan cat jaataa he
 Principals threaten by showing fear of jobs
 tab bhi ye apana class lene ke baad is dharne main shaamil ho rahe hai
 Prakash Jhavadekar had clearly stated that part time employment is not the policy of central universities
 march 2017 kaa bayaan he
 Now you see the statement of 11 October 2017 which ran on our channel
 6 maheene biit jane ke baad bhi mantri ji vahi baat kar rahe hai ki 9000 pad bhar die jaaenge
 Even after 6 months, Prakash Jhavekar is talking about a year
 march 2017 main prakaash jhaavdekar ne yah bhi kaha tha ki ek saal ke bheetar kendiy vidyalayon main das hazaar vekency bharne kii bhi baat kahi thi jiske bare main mujhe apadet nahin he ki wo das hazaar pad ek saal ke bheetar bhare gaye yaa nahin
 Prakash Jhavadekar did not only talk about Delhi University at that time, but said that all vacancies in Central University would be cleared
 central uniwarsity main 20 pratishat pad khaali the
 This number seems small in percentage, but when we look at a thousand, it will be several thousand
 mantri ji ne kaha tha ki inkaa har 15 din main rivyuu hoga or website par jaankaree di jaaegi
 No such information is found on the UGC website
 janvari 2019 aa gai
 Reservation is being said to be successful, no one will get the benefit and no one is getting it without making the job restoration process honest and agile
 kisi bhi party kii sarkaar ko
 Every day hundreds of boys and girls from Madhya Pradesh message that after 25 years, Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission took the assistant professor exam
 hoicourt kaa order tha ki 2018-19 kaa seshan shuru hone se pehle inaki niyukti kar di jaae
 Under this, the examination took place and the result came in August 2018
 in sabakaa veriphication bhi ho gaya he magar posting nahin hui he
 Think what happens, colleges do not have teachers
 to aapke bachche barbaad hote honge
 Now return to Delhi
 march 2017 se janvari 2019 aa gai
 Permanent job address is not available
 kai raajnneetik dal, tamaam shikshak sanghathanon ke samarthan ke baad bhi inaki samasya kaa hal nahin he
 Their demand is that an ordinance should be brought to permit teachers teaching for 10 years and 15 years
 kyonki ye yogyata kii sharton ko puraa karte hue das das saal se padhaa rahe hai
 Not only this, every four months, the university gives a certificate to these ad hoc teachers that your service is satisfactory
 jo shikshak das saal se padhaa rahe hai unke paas kalege or uniwarsity se 30 certificate jamaa ho chuke hai ki aap acha padhaate hai
 Therefore your services are expanded
 5 march 2018 ko ujisi ne ek circular nikaala ki kalege ko ek unit nahin maanenge, vibhaag ko unit maanenge or roster banaaenge yani shikshakon kii seva or zaruuratein tay karenge
 Due to this policy, thousands of adhoc teachers would come on the road, it would also take away the constitutional rights of teachers of scheduled castes and tribes
 to dharna de rahe hai in shikshakon main general bhi hai, anusuchit jati, janajati, isai musalmaan sikh sab hai jinke liye sarkaar aarakshan laane ke liye itani mehnat kar rahi he
 There will be hard work in restoration only then you will get the benefit of reservation jab ujisi ke circular kaa virodh hua to 19 july 2018 ko desh bhar kii uniwarsity main naukariyaan band kar di gayi
 The government said that we will bring the ordinance
 8 se 9 maheene honge adhyadesh nahin aayaa
 This is the condition of a large university in India
 hamaare sahyogi saurav shukla ne in sabhi shikshakon se baat kii he
 Reporting on the spot
 aap hairaan ho jaaenge ki mahila shikshikaayen kai kai saal se padhaa rahi hai magar unhen is dilli main maatrutiv avkaash kaa laabh nahin miltaa he
 3 lakh 80 thousand filled forms for about 2000 posts in Delhi University
 vekency to 4500 kii aani thi magar ai 2000 kii
 700-800 rupees were spent on filling the teachers' forms and getting the photo copies of documents
 wo bhi ek college ke
 It cost a teacher several thousand rupees to fill for many colleges
 unki jeb se uniwarsity or kalege ko 15-20 karod mil gaye
 It has been 15-16 months but the restoration is not known
 kuch dinon main ye farm laps ho jaaenge or paisa barbaad
 Since 2007, many forms have come out
 fees dekar bharaa gaya he or farm laps ho jaataa he
 Delhi High Court had ordered that 4500 posts should be filled by 31 July 2017
 magar vigyaapan hi niklaa 2000 padon kaa
 Out of that, three posts are filled in two years
 ye dilli vishvavidlaay kaa haal he
 Adhak teachers said that if there were interviews in three departments, the teacher who had been teaching for 18 years was excluded
 dilli main hi upiessi ke pareeksharathi noujvaan das dinon se mukhaji nagar main bhukh hadtaal par baithe hai
 On 9 January, protests began outside Parliament

 There has also been an information that the number of Hindi speaking candidates in UPSC has decreased continuously

 So they are asking for another chance for themselves
 jab netaa aarakshan ke sawaal ko lekar vaahvahee lut rahe the tab ye ladke dilli main hi balki sansad main apane sawaalon ko lekar pradarshan kar rahe the
 Among them will be generals, SC ST Muslims and Christians

 The idea behind this is that there should be a stronger group of importers than the producers in the market, who are in a position to negotiate a better bargain with them and to get more supply of American crude oil

 Interested in taking crude oil from Chinese companies, CNPC and its subsidiaries sell crude oil produced from their oil fields in third countries to foreign markets

 Lava Z61 ke spacifications Since Congress leader Shankar Singh Vaghela's Twitter account was unfollowed by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi along with many other Congress leaders in Gujarat, such things have started floating in the mind that Shankar Singh Vaghela can switch from Congress to BJP

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter varun dhawan kii film 'badrinaath kii dulhaniya' box offis par acchhee kamai kar rahi he
 Recently, Varun Dhawan talked to us
 film or apni jindagi se jude kuch sawaalon kaa jawaab varun dhawan ne kuch is tarah diya
 
 
 1
 'badrinaath' ke liye aapkaa kya riection tha?jab main 'hampti sharma kii dulhaniya' kii shooting kar rahaa tha, tab hi mujhe pataa tha ki majhe shashaank khetaan ke saath ek or film kerani he
 Shashank is very positive and he polishes people
 aalia bhi unke saath kaam karnaa chaahati thim
 Badrinath Ki Dulhania joins the 100 crore club! 2
 aapaki ganit kamjor he?wo shashaank ne mere upar hi joke likhaa he
 He also asked me about mathematics and kept the same in the film
 vaise bhi pyaar karne vaale maths main kamjor hote hai kyonki pyaar main koi calculation nahin hoti
 varun-alia 3 became the new song of 'badri Ki Dulhania', 'humsafar'
 aapke parivaar or govinda ke bich manmutav he?main govinda se bahut baar mila hum
 He has also blessed me a lot
 mujhe lagata he ki agar sab thik karnaa he to papa or govinda ko milakar sab thik kar lenaa chahie
 i am not in a place to correct
 donon main koun sahi he or koun galat, main yah to nahin bataa saktaa lekin donon ko aapas main baithkar sab sulajhaa lenaa chahie
 Varun Dhawan 4, spending vacation in Thailand with Natasha
 aap dead ke saath 'judwa 2' kar rahe hai ?mere dead hameshaa se mujhe lekar dabl role vaali film bananaa chaahate the
 Hardly anyone else has made the double role films that Dad has made
 unka maananaa he ki actor kii asli takat is tarah ke role main hi pataa chalati he
 Because the actor has to play two types of roles simultaneously
 sajid sar ko bhi 'judwa 2' banani thi, isliye sabhi chijen ek jagah par aa gayi
 5
 aapako sabhi tarah kii filmein karnaa pasand he?haa, kyonki mujhe ek hi tarah ke role karne vaale kaa tag nahin chahie or saath hi alag-alag tarah ke kirdaar karne ke liye mujhe ek chalange miltaa he
 That is why there is an effort to do different films
 6
 You will also be compared to Salman in 'twins'? We are not recreating 'twins'
 ek alag hi tarah se film bana rahe hai
 There are also some generations who have not seen 'twins'
 hamaari koshish he kii 'judawaan 2' kaaphi alag banaai jaae
 7
 aapaki dulhaniya kisi hogi?varun kii dulhaniya acchhee hogi, jo varun ko sataayegi nahin
 But there is a lot of time in that
 8
 How do people see stardom? When people like my characters, i like them more
 dekhie jab film relies ho jaati he to uske baad ek actor ke liye kaaphi akelaapan ho jaataa he, bahut udaasi hoti he
 But after that, it is good if there is a next film
 9
 Do you consider your pair with Alia like Shah rukh-kajol? No, they are quite big
 meri or aalia kii jodi aaj ke jamaane kii aalia-varun kii jodi he
 People of all ages should like it
 10
 What to say on Twitter trends and trolls? i never write thoughtfully, my family and family always tell me about this
 haal hi main maine ek twit bhi kiya tha ki 1984 ke baad kii generation main kitna badlaav aa gaya he
 Technology has increased, but there should be balance in this life
 jab alcohol yaa drugs piya jaataa he to hamaare brain main ek chemical relies hota he jo kii alcohol yaa drugs ke prati hamaara rujhaan badha detaa he
 The same happens on social networks, if less likes come from the previous post on the next post, then the person goes into depression, which is very unhealthy for us
 ye ek alag hi duniya ho chuki he
 This happens to me too, i too feel low sometimes
 11
 Afraid of anything? Not yet at the moment but yes the growing age of the family is scared
 main apane kareebi logon ko kho dene se darataa hum
 12
 karan johar kii kitaab bhi badi khaas he
 Would you like to play his character? Karan is an attractive character
 vaise badrinaath kaa kirdaar bhi kisi byopic se kam nahin he kyonki yah kirdaar shashaank ne apane jaanane vaale ke upar hi likhaa he
 When you watch the film, you will feel that you have seen such a person somewhere
 13
 What films are you doing next? 'judwaa 2' and a Shoojit Sarkar film, which i will tell later

 vahiin, rajyapal najma hepatulla ne ummid jataai ki nakaabandi khatm hone ke baad rajya main shanti or khushhaali aegi
 Why was the blockade? Naga organizations blocked National Highways 2 and 37 from 1 November 2016
 ye sanghathan manipur ke naga aabaadi vaale ilaakon main 7 naye jile banane kaa virodh kar rahe the
 This decision was taken by the Ibobi Singh-led Congress government

 The comments rajasthan hoicourt ne das agast 2015 ko kaha tha ki santhara aatmahatya jaise he or isse bhartiya dand samhita ke tahat 309 main kaarwahee honi chahie

 At the moment when votes are being cast for the new President of the country
 bihar kii siyasat par sabaki nigahen tiki hui hai
 There is speculation that in the next 24 hours Nitish Kumar may take a major decision against his deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav, embroiled in corruption charges
 agar aisa hua to mahagathbandhan par bhi khatra mandaraane lagegaa
 However, analysts keeping an eye on the political situation believe that there will be a grand alliance left even if Tejashwi goes to the chair, because this battle is not just about changing the political equations but is only of image and importance
 ghotaalon ke maamle main sibiai kii exiaar main naam aane ke baad nitish cabinet se tejasvi kaa janaa tay he
 Because Nitish's party JDU is constantly saying that it will not compromise on corruption
 yani maamla nitish kii chhavi kaa he jinpar pichley do dashakon se mukhyamantri rahane ke baavjood karpshan kaa koi aarope nahin he
 Now the only question is whether Tejashwi will resign himself or else Nitish will sack him
 nitish ko apni chhavi kii chintaa he to sawaal lalu ke ahm kaa bhi he
 RJD argues that Nitish or JDU cannot treat him like a horse, despite being more in number
 argedy jaanati he ki mahagathbandhan bachaana jitani uski majaburi he utani hi nitish or jediu kii he isliye nitish ko hi ise bachaane kii pahal kerani chahie or lalu se baat kar koi bich kaa rasta nikaalnaa chahie
 Party leaders are now openly saying that Nitish should talk to Lalu
 kya hoga bich kaa rastitna saaf he ki nitish ab tejasvi ko kisi keemat par sarkaar main nahin dekhnaa chaahate
 On removing them, the Grand Alliance breaks down and Nitish will not want to run the government again with the help of BJP
 yahi vajah he ki bich ke raste kii baat kii ja rahi he
 An alternative is to ask Tejashwi to resign and Lalu to make his family deputy CM
 is kadi main lalu kii beti rohinee yadav kaa naam bhi charchaa main chal rahaa he
 What is Lalu's plan - Lalu's return to political alliance with Benetish may seem stern, but in any case he would not like to see the Grand Alliance broken

 iske tahat har roj bijepi kejariwal sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan kar rahi he
 Delhi BJP Purvanchal Morcha led by Delhi BJP General Secretary Rajesh Bhatia staged a sit-in at Rajghat
 jis tarah mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal rajghat par mahatma gandhi ke samadhi ke saamne baithkar prarthana karte hai or bhrashtachar par chup rahete hai, dilli bijepi ne kejariwal se puchha he ki 'ye rishta kya kehalaata he'
 Because why are Kejriwal finally trying to save Satyendra Jain, despite the constant allegations against the minister of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 dilli bijepi ke netaaon ne dharna pradarshan ke baad baapu ke samadhi par prarthana kii
 In fact, the BJP has now attacked Satyendra Jain and CM Arvind Kejriwal after getting property documents belonging to Minister Satyendar Jain in Delhi Government during the CBI raid
 dilli bijepi is maamle main satyendra jain ke alaava dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal se bhi istipha maanga he
 The BJP said that the Arvind Kejriwal government is continuously undermining political dignity
 isse pehle bhi hawala maamle bhi sibiai satendra jain se poochtacha kar rahi he lekin aaropon ke baavjood bhikejariwal sarkarmen satyendra jain bharosemand mantri hai
 At the same time, while defending Satyendar Jain, the Aam Aadmi Party is blaming the BJP itself that the central government is deliberately taking on the Kejriwal government

 This is unfortunate and has caused great hardship to the passengers

 a senior Income Tax official who was traveling by the same plane reported that the protesting passengers sat on the runway and they stopped several flights

 He said that there is no justification to reach Ahmedabad in the evening instead of traveling for 1-2 hours

 Interestingly, Corporate Communications Department of Air India did not know anything
 jab unase poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki ahmedabad main baari barish ke kaaran aisa ho rahaa he
 Later this flight took place at 3:30 pm
 lekin kai yatri apane gharon ko laut gaye kyonki unka kaam vahaan din kaa tha
 Some of the passengers who came from London had necessary work in Ahmedabad, a family was going to attend the funeral
 ek yatri ne kaha ki hamen pataa he ki barish ke kaaran udaanen prabhavit hoti hai lekin is missmanagement ke bare main kya kahenge? yatriyon ko bina payalat vaale vimaan main do ghante tak bithaae rakhaa gaya

 ajtak-karvi ke survey 'desh kaa mizaaj' main uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi sarkaar sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se adhiktar janata khush he
 This is the reason that his stature in the list of the best Chief Ministers of the country is constantly rising and he has managed to make it to the top-5
 yogi kii lokapriyata main pichley kareeb dedh saal main 10 fisadi kaa ijapha dekha gaya he
 The survey was done on 2478 people, in which 20 Lok Sabha constituencies were included
 yah exclusive survey 28 disambar se 8 janvari tak karaayaa gaya
 In August 2017, Yogi Adityanath was the best Chief Minister in the opinion of 30 percent voters of UP but by January this figure had come down and 28 percent people considered Yogi as the best CM
 iske baad agast 2018 main yogi kii lokapriyata ekaek kareeb 33 fisadi bad gai or 28 fisadi kaa aankada badhkar 42 fisadi ho gaya
 This surge in popularity, however, has fallen slightly and in January this year, 40 per cent of the people feel that Yogi Adityanath is the best Chief Minister
 40 fisadi voton ke saath yogi desh ke sheersh paanch lokapriy mukhyamantriyon main shaamil ho gaye hai
 Apart from him, the four chief ministers who are in this list include Chandrasekha Rao of Telangana, Mamta Banerjee of West Bengal, Naveen Patnaik of Odisha and Nitish Kumar of Bihar
 inhone ajtak ke is survey main 55 se 80 fisadi tak vot paae hai
 According to the survey, people have expressed their happiness over the functioning of the Yogi Adityanath government
 57 fisadi log yogi adityanath sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se bahut santusht or santusht hai jabaki keval 15 fisadi logon ne hi yogi sarkaar se niraashaa athwa bahut niraashaa jataai he
 There is 27 per cent of the population who are neither satisfied nor disappointed with the Yogi government
 mukhyamantri ke parformens kii baat karen to yogi adityanath ke kaamkaaj se upi kii 17 fisadi log behad santusht hai jabaki 40 fisadi log aise hai jo bahut to nahin magar sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se khush jarur hai
 The survey also revealed that 57 percent of the voters of the state are satisfied with the work of the Yogi government
 27 fisadi log aise bhi hai jinhone na to sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke prati santosh jaahir kiya or na hi unke andar koi asantosh hi he
 The bottom line of the survey shows that 84 percent of the people are not disappointed or dissatisfied with the functioning of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and his government
 bijepi ke liye ise badi or rahatbhari khabar kah sakate hai
 The rapid increase in Yogi Adityanath's graph may be considered a setback for the opposition as the opposition is claiming its victory in the Lok Sabha elections by telling people in the state to be upset with the Yogi government

 Demanding interference from the President, Kammetti said in a press conference that since God has Supreme Court status, the trust of the public will be shaken by this matter so the President can intervene in the matter

 Although the responsibility of the security of a specific person lies on the shoulders of the NSG, but the way the number of Z-plus security takers has increased, the CISF is also being entrusted with this task

 faijabad hawaii pattee se udaan bharenge bhagwaan ramram apane bhai lakshmana or patni sita ke saath faijabad hawaii pattee se helicopter main savaar hokar sidhe ayodhya ke ramakatha park pahunchenge
 Where Yogi Adityanath and Governor Ramnaik will be received by taking the stand
 uske baad unka pujan archan hoga or baqayada ramadrabar lagegaa or unka rajbhishek kiya jayega
 It will all look the same as it did when Lord Rama reached Ayodhya by Pushpak Vimana after the Lanka victory in Treta Yuga
 is sabko dekhte hue suraksha kii vyapak vyavastha bhi kii gai he
 Police and paramilitary personnel will patrol the streets if they are seen patrolling the police teams in Saryu
 sarayu ke ghat par paune 2 lakh diye jalaane kii taiyaariis kaarykram kaa shubharambh din ke 2 baje shobhaa yatra se hoga jo 4 baje ramakatha park pahonchegi, jahaan mukhyamantri or rajyapal swaagat karenge
 There will be many programs of beneficiaries on the platform, housing, electricity connection and some children and women will also be given clothing and gifts
 iske baad 6 baje ke kareeb ghat par sarayu aarti ke liye jaaenge
 Aarti program is being done daily on the orders of the Chief Minister
 iske hi vrihad rup main lagbhag paune 2 lakh die jalaane kaa kaarykram he
 The most special aspect of Yogi Adityanath's program is to embody the scene of Treta Yuga, in which Lord Rama had reached Ayodhya with Sri Lakshman and wife Sita after the victory of Lanka and brother Bharata rushed to receive him and then coronated him
 i went
 bharat kii bhoomika main honge CM yogiis baar bhi puspak vimaan kii tarah hi helicopter hoga, jo faijabad hawaii pattee se ram-lakshmana or sita ko lekar sidhe ayodhya ke ramakatha park pahonchega, jahaan bharat kii jagah yogi adityanath or rajyapal ramanike unki agavaani karenge
 The time has been kept in such a way that as soon as Yogi Adityanath arrives at Faizabad airstrip on October 18 at 4 pm, he will reach Ramakatha Park in Ayodhya by road
 vaise hi saket se nikali shobhaa yatra kii ramlila jhankiyaan bhi pahunchengi
 Yogi Adityanath will receive Khandu and now Yogi will be inspecting these Shobha Yatras only when the chopper carrying ram-laxman and Sita from Faizabad airstrip will directly reach Ramkatha Park, where Yogi will receive him along with Khetaun

 yun to apane karnaamon se aksaruttar pradesh pulicecharchaa main rahati he, lekin aaj ham aapako upi ke ek aise dariyadil pulisavaale se rubaru karaane ja rahe hai jisane maanavtaa kii misaal kaayam kar police ke sakaaratmak pahalu ko bhi samaaj ke saamne rakhaa he
 The police officer has treated two poor girls injured in a road accident at their own expense
 pulisavaale kii madad se hi aaj donon bacchiyaan jinda hai, kyonki inke gharavaalon ke paas itane paise nahin the ki wo inkaa ilaaj karvaa pate
 So far this police officer has spent more than Rs 1,12,000 in the treatment of these two girls
 upi ke chandauli jile ke sakaldiha cirkil main tainaat yah police afasar aaj bhi un bacchiyon ke ilaaj kaa kharch khud uthaa rahaa he
 The villagers, including the family of the girls, now consider this police officer as an angel
 darasal pichley maheene janmashtami ke din shaam ke vakt antima or sanjana naam kii donon bacchiyaan sadak se guzar raheen thim
 Then both were seriously injured due to the grip of a high speed bike
 bacchiyon kii haalat kaaphi najuk thi
 Both the girls are from very poor family and how their families get their wages done
 aise main in bacchiyon kaa ilaaj kaise hoga yah ek vikat samasya thi, kyonki in donon bacchiyon ke gharavaalon ke paas inke ilaaj ke liye paise nahin the
 When Deputy SP Tripurari Pandey came to know about this, he immediately took out his ATM card and along with one of his soldiers sent these girls to the Trauma Center in Varanasi so that they can be treated quickly and save the lives of these girls
 bacchiyon ko kai din tak isiu main rakhaa gaya
 On the other hand, the family were worried about where the long-term treatment for these two would come from
 lekin is dariyadil police afasar tripurari pandeya ne in bacchiyon ko na sirf aspataal main bhartee karaayaa balki apni selary se lakhon rupye kharchakar inaki jaan bachaa lee
 These two girls have now returned from the hospital to their home, but the treatment is still going on and all their expenses are still borne by Tripurari Pandey
 ek pulisavaale kii is dariyaadilii kii charchaa har taraf ho rahi he
 At the same time, the families of the girls and the villagers have started giving the status of God to Tripurari Pandey
 ladakiyon kii maa reeta devi ne bataaya ki sio sahab ne agar hamaari bacchiyon ko aspataal main bhartee nahin karaayaa hota to aaj hamaari betiyaan zindaa nahin hotin
 Ravindra Rajbhar, the daughter-in-law of the girls and Bimala Devi, a woman from the village, said that CO Tripurari Pandey came to be a god to us and not only saved the lives of both the girls but is still paying for the treatment
 dipti espi tripurari pandeya ne kaha ki ghatnasthal par pahunchakar or vahaan ke halaat dekhne baad sabase pehle ye laga ki in donon bacchiyon kii jaan bachaani jaruri he
 The relatives of the girl child are very poor and due to lack of money, the treatment of these girls was being affected
 isiilie maine apana atm card apane sipaahi ko diya or ghayal bacchiyon ke saath aspataal bheja taaki paise kii kami ke chalate in bacchiyon kii jaan jokhim main na pade
 He told that today the girls are safe and safe for them

 cpm's elderly leader Jyoti Basu has said that it is difficult for the Third Front to come to power in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki ve yah bhi kehete hai ki desh ke vikaas kaa yahi ekmaatr rasta he
 On Tuesday, Basu told reporters at his Salt Lake residence, "we need to bring the Third Front to power immediately at the center
" yadi aisa hua to marxvaadi communist party is baar sarkaar main shaamil hogi
 The former Chief Minister of West Bengal said, "however, it is very difficult for the Third Front to come to power
" ham ek baar pehle bhi (1996) main is masale par naakaam ho chuke hai
 'the Third Front is a coalition of parties opposing the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party
 ise pichley saptaah karnataka ke tumkur main shuru kiya gaya tha
 The CPI (M) is its main component
 95 varshiya basu ne haalanki kaha, 'agar hamaara lakshya aisi sarkaar kaa gathan karnaa he, jo janata ke kaam aae, to teesraa morcha ekmaatr samaadhaan he
 ' taliban ne to pakistan kii naak main dam kar rakhaa he lekin pakistan or america fouj kii tamaam koshishon swat ghati main bekaar gayin
 But now Pakistan will attack Taliban
 paak ke aatanrik kaary mantri rahamaan malik ne apane desh kii sansad main ye daawa kiya
 a special strategy has been devised to liberate Swat, known as Switzerland of Pakistan, from terrorists
 pakistan ne ab faisla kiya he apni jameen ko taliban ke kabje se khaali karaane kaa
 Rehman Malik, the internal affairs adviser to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, informed the Pakistani Senate that a special strategy has been prepared to free Pakistan's Jannat Swat Valley from terrorists
 jo pakistan hameshaa se taliban or al-kaayda ko lekar apni bebasii kaa ronaa rota rahaa he aaj vahi hukumat taliban ke khilaaf jang kaa elaan kar rahi he
 General Kiani, the chief of the Pakistan Army, also visited Swat on 29 January
 kiyani ne saaf kaha ki taliban ke khilaaf oparation raahe-haq ke tisare charan main swat ko paak fouj surakshit kar legi
 However, how important this tour is, everyone has understood after the failure of the first two phases of this operation
 swat ghati barbaad ho chuki he tabah ho chuki he kuch arase pehle tak jo ilaaka pakistan kaa jananath kehalaata tha wo ab jahannum main tabdeel ho chukaa he
 Rahamam Malik also revealed the five terrorist organizations operating in Swat
 ji haa, swat main philhal al-kaayda, taharike-taliban, tanjime-islamic, tora bora group or kari mushtak group kii dhak he
 According to Pakistan, it is now about to open a front against these five terrorist organizations
 daawa to yahaan tak kiya ja rahaa he ki mahaj kuch hafton main hi swat se tamaam aatankwaadi sanghathanon kaa safaya kar diya jayega
 Rahman Malik is even saying that under the new strategy, Mingora, a town of Swat, which has become the stronghold of Talibanis, has been captured by the government and the situation is under control
 ab pakistan ke in tamaam daavon main kitna dam he isaki pole to har aae din swat ko nark se bhi badtar banane vaale al-kaayda or taharike taliban ke dehshatgard to khol hi rahe hai
 It is also believed that Pakistan is trying to show the world, especially the US and Hindustan, that yes, we too are against terrorism and now want to eliminate the terrorists in our area
 baharhaal pakistan kaa ye nayaa daawa sachai he yaa shigupha, is bare main kuch bhi kahana mushkil he kyonki pantarebaaji main pakistan kaa koi jod nahin
 Pakistan has announced to destroy the Taliban, but the war between the Taliban and Pakistan is not compulsive
 agar pakistan ne taliban ko tabah nahin kiya to taliban pakistan ko kisi kaam kaa nahin chhodega auki pakistan ke hukmaranon ko ab is baat kaa ahsaas ho chukaa he
 They have realized that the Taliban is moving very fast towards Islamabad
 hakeekat to ye he ki pakistan agar dehshatgardon ke sanghathan ko ab bhi badhaava detaa rahaa to wo din dur nahin jab islmabad main bhi talibani takaton kii hi sarkaar hogi
 The Bhasmasur of the Taliban and al-qaeda is getting closer to the power of Islamabad every day, but the Pakistani government is still not aware of the danger
 pakistan kii sena or uski khufia agenciyaan ab bhi khuleam al-kaayda auki talibani takaton ko shah de rahi hai
 Whereas a large part of Pakistan has either been captured by the jihadi forces or under their tremendous influence
 north west frontier provins main afghanistan border se sata phata ilaaka
 To say that this is the Federal Administered Tribal Area of pakistan, but in reality it has become Taliban
 yahaan taliban ke farmaan par hota he katleam
 In their courts, people give hearings according to the attendance and Sharia
 unke radiyon par jari kiye jate hai aise paigaam jisaki andekhi karne kii himakat vahi kar saktaa he jise apni jindagi se pyaar nahin
 The Taliban and Al Qaeda terrorists are destroying dozens of schools every day
 kyonki jehadi talim ke sivaa unhen kuch bhi manjuur nahin
 The Taliban have taken a very dangerous route to prove their occupation of Mingora city in the Swat Valley
 talibani aatankwaadi jab bhi kisi police ke jawan yaa sarkari karinde kaa qatl karte hai, to unki laashon ko mingora ke main chauraahey par phenk dete hai
 There is a danger with corpses that if someone removes the corpses before 11 o'clock in the day, the next day his corpse will be found here
 hakeekat to ye he ki pakistan ke ek bade ilaake main rahane vaale logon kii jindagi kaa har pal taliban or al-kaayda kii raham kaa mohataaj he or agar pakistani hukumat ab bhi nahin jaagi to uskaa bhi vahi hasr hone vaala he jo pakistan kii lakhon bekasoor logon kaa ho rahaa he
 Pakistan has made up its mind to fight with the Taliban
 par sabase bada sawaal ye he ki kya wo taliban ko apni jameen se khaded paaegaa? america ko aath saal lag gaye par wo taliban or al-kaayda ko ab tak puri tarah khatm nahin kar sakaa he
 Then how will Pakistan overcome the Taliban? Taliban fighters with random pajamas and ak-47s in hand are still chewing up the superpower of the world
 9 / 11 ke baad se hi america sena al-qaayada or taliban ke peeche padi he lekin kamyaabi ab bhi usase koson dur he
 Why is this so? kyon america ko 8 saal se afghanistan or pakistan ke kabyli ilaakon main sangharsh karnaa pad rahaa he? kyon use ab tak vahaan puri tarah se kamyaabi nahin mil pai he? kyon wo ab tak al-kaayda or taliban ko mitaa nahin paaya he? to isaki kai vajahen hai
 The first reason is America's intention
 darasal taliban ko lekar america kii niyat shuru se saaf nahin rahi he
 Significantly, the Taliban was raised by no one else but the US itself
 afghanistan main rus ke kilaaf
 Even as the American was successful in his cause, Russia broke into pieces
 lekin vahi taliban ab america ke liye hi bhasmasoor ban gaya
 Many American policymakers feel that the Taliban may be compromised to capture Osama-bin Laden
 8 saal kii lambii ladaai ke baad osama kaa al-qaayada to tora-bora ke kabyli ilaakon tak simat gaya
 His network also weakened
 kufia tantra bhi zyada kargar nahin rahaa lekin taliban in aath saalon main or bhi tacover ho gaya
 The American military is also facing many difficulties in overcoming the Taliban
 afghanistan main america fouz kii sabase badi takat hawaii hamalaa he
 There is tremendous fear of B52 aircraft
 lekin taliban ne bheed main khokar isse bachane kaa bhi rasta nikaal liya
 The people there trust the Taliban more than the foreign army
 yahi janata taliban kii aankh-kaan bhi hai
 Because of which the American army is not working in the ground war
 kyonki talibaniyon ko america fouj kii har harakat kii khabar pehle hi mil jaati he
 The difficulty of the American military is further enhanced by Afghanistan's geographical location and the Taliban's mastery of guerrilla warfare
 america senaaon kii kai chook bhi use taliban ke khilaaf janata se nahin jod pai
 In July 2002, based on intelligence, the US Army launched a missile attack on the Talibani camp on Oruzgan Hill
 lekin missile ek rihaayshi basti par ja gira jisamen 40 se zyada log maare gaye
 During the raid many times, the misbehaving of the American army made the Afghan people an enemy
 aise main janata kaa sahyog use kabhi nahin mila
 America also had high hopes from Afghan's Hagamid Karzai government, but Karzai's tone is also changing now
 wo vikaas kii baaten to karte hai lekin taliban par nakel kasne ke mudde par kanni kaat jate hai
 It will be seen that how does Pakistan overcome all these problems while tightening the Taliban? kharaab vittiya haalat se jujh rahi dilli nagar nigam ko centre sarkaar se bada jhatka laga he
 Union Minister Hardeep Puri has refused to provide new funds to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi at present
 darasal buudhvaar shaam dilhinagar nigamake teenon hi meyar kamishnar ke saath kendriya shahari vikaas mantri hardip puri se milane unke daftar pahunche the
 Given the poor condition of the corporation, all the three mayors hoped that they would get a good relief package from the central government, but sources say that Union Minister Hardeep Puri expressed his displeasure due to the non-reporting of the old fund so far
 He refused to give any new money
 vipaksh ne lee chutakiiski jaankaree jaise hi vipaksh ko mili vah hamalavar ho gaya
 In South Delhi Municipal Corporation, Aam Aadmi Party's Leader of Opposition Praveen Kumar attacked the BJP government on the status of the corporation, while the leader of the opposition of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, Anil Lakra also quipped on the disastrous condition of the corporation
 anil lakada ne kaha ab to centre sarkaar ne bhi emsidi se apana haath hataa liya he
 Hardeep Puri reprimanded all the three corporations for not properly accounting for the old fund
 mantri ne kaha fund maangane kii bajaay nigam swayan hi aise upaay kare jisase wo aatmanirbhar ho sake
 Sources reveal that the commissioner demanded money from the unused fund of the central government, which Hardeep Puri refused

 He said that there is no such thing nor there was a refusal to give funds

 BREXIT means Britain's exit from the European Union
 aitihaasik refrendom main britain european sangh se baahar ho gaya he
 After the decision of the referendum, it has seen its impact in the stock market including India
 lekin in sabase pehle yah bhi jaananaa jaruri he ki kyon britain ko iyu se alag hone kii maang uthi? alag hone se bharat ko kya nuksaan ho sakate hai or kya he european union
 Why did the demand for Britain's separation from the EU arise? Great Britain's economy fell into recession in 2008
 desh main berogari bad gai
 This led to a debate as to whether Britain should break away from the European Union? This demand was raised by the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in the 2015 general elections in Britain
 is dhade kaa maananaa he ki agar britain european union se alag ho jaataa he to desh kii sari dikkatein dur ho jaaengi
 Why did the need for a referendum? One faction in Britain also believes that Britain's separation from the European Union would be a big blow to the country
 pradhanmantridavid camranor conservative party kaa bhi yahi maananaa he
 The opinion of British citizens is also divided on this issue
 isliye maamle par janamatsangrah karwaanaa sahi samajha gaya
 Around 40 million people are eligible to participate in the referendum
 britain ko phayda-britain ko salanaa european union ke bajet ke liye 9 arab dollar nahin dene honge
 - The movement of the uk's borders will be controlled without hindrance
 - free vija policy kii vajah se britain ko ho rahaa nuksaan bhi kam hoga
 Loss to Britain - Estimates of 1 to 3 percent loss to British GDP
 - britain ke liye single market system khatm ho jayega
 - In other European countries, Britain will have business problems
 - puure european union par britain kaa dabadabaa khatm ho jayega
 What is European Union? -28 is the organization of European countries
 -1957 main 6 deshon (belgium, france, italy, lakjamberg, netherlands) ne neenv rakhi
 As of 2015, the European Union has a population of more than 500 million
 - iske sabhi sadsy deshon kii ek hi karency he
 - Citizens of the countries included in the EU can live and trade in any of the 28 countries

 He is placed on full life support at AIIMS, Delhi
 vaajapeyi desh ke pehle netaa hai jo gaiyr congressi pradhanmantri bane the
 Many records are recorded in the name of various politicians of the country for winning and losing elections, but two outstanding records are recorded in the name of Vajpayee
 vaajapeyi desh ke ekmaatr aise rajaneta hai, jo chaar rajyon ke chah loksabhaa kshetron kii numaaindgi kar chuke hai
 Vajpayee is the only leader to win elections from Lucknow and Balrampur in Uttar Pradesh, Gandhinagar in Gujarat, Gwalior and Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh and New Delhi parliamentary seat in Delhi
 atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa janm 25 disambar 1924 ko hua, is din ko bharat main bada din kaha jaataa he
 Vajpayee entered politics in 1942 when his brother went to jail for 23 days during the Quit India Movement
 1951 main aresas ke sahyog se bhartiya jansangh party kaa gathan hua to shyama prasad mukherjee jaise netaaon ke saath atal bihari vaajapeyi kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 In 1952, Atal Bihari Vajpayee contested the Lucknow Lok Sabha seat for the first time, but did not succeed
 ye uttar pradesh kii ek loksabhaa seat par hue up chunaav main utre the jahaan unhen haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee had his first breakthrough in 1957
 1957 main jansangh ne unhen teen loksabhaa siton lakhanu, mathura or balrampur se chunaav ladaaya
 He lost the election in Lucknow, his bail in Mathura was forfeited but he won the Lok Sabha from Balrampur parliamentary seat
 vaajapeyi ke asaadhaaran vyaktitv ko dekhakar us samay ke vartmaan pradhanmantri pandit jawaharlal nehru ne kaha tha ki aane vaale dinon main yah vyakti jarur pradhanmantri banegaa
 Vajpayee contested the third Lok Sabha election from Lucknow in 1962, but could not win
 iske baad ve rajyasabha sadsy chune gaye
 After this, he again contested the Lok Sabha elections in 1967 but could not win
 iske baad 1967 main hi upachunaav hua, jahaan se ve jitkar sansad bane
 After this, in 1968, Vajpayee became the National President of the National Jana Sangh
 us samay party ke saath nanaaji deshmukh, balraj madhok tathaa laalkrishna adwani jaise netaa the
 In the fifth Lok Sabha election in 1971, Atal Bihari Vajpayee won from the Gwalior Parliamentary seat of Madhya Pradesh and won the Parliament
 apatkaal ke baad hue chunaav main 1977 or phir 1980 ke madhyavadhi chunaav main unhone nai dilli sansadeey kshetra kaa pratinidhitiv kiya
 In 1984, Atal Bihari filed the Lok Sabha election from Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh and suddenly the Congress pitted Madhavrao Scindia against him
 jabaki madhavrao guna sansadeey kshetra se chunakar aate the
 Vajpayee lost 232 votes to Scindia
 bataa den ki atal bihari ne ek baar zikr bhi kiya tha ki unhone swayan sansad ke galiyare main madhavrao se poocha tha ki ve gwalior se to chunaav nahin ladenge
 Madhavrao refused at that time, but as part of the Congress strategy, he was suddenly filed
 is tarahwajpeyike paas mauka hi nahin bachaa ki duusari jagah se namakan daakhil kar pate
 In such a situation, he had to face defeat from Scindia
 iske baad vaajapeyi 1991 ke aam chunaav main lakhanu or madhya pradesh kii vidisha seat se chunaav lade or donon hi jagah se jite
 He later gave up the Vidisha seat
 haalanki, 1996 main hawala cond main apana naam aane ke kaaran laalkrishna adwani gandhinagar se chunaav nahin lade
 In this situation, Atal Bihari Vajpayee contested from Lucknow seat as well as Gandhinagar and won from both places
 iske baad se vaajapeyi ne lakhanu ko apni karmbhumi bana lee
 He won the Lok Sabha elections of 1998 and 1999 from Lucknow seat and became an MP
 dilachasp baat ye he ki 1962 main jab atal bihari vaajapeyi chunaav haar gaye to uske baad ve rajyasabha sadsy ke rup main sansad pahunche
 After this, when he lost in 1984, in 1986 he was elected as a member of the Rajya Sabha
 apatkaal ke baad 1977 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main janata party kii jeet hui thi or ve morarji bhai desai ke netritv vaali sarkaar main videsh maamalon ke mantri bane
 After becoming the foreign minister, Vajpayee was the first leader to address the United Nations Federation in Hindi
 iske baad janata party antarkalah ke kaaran bikhar gai or 1980 main vaajapeyi ke saath puraane dost bhi janata party chhod bhartiya janata party se jud gaye
 Vajpayee became the first national president of the BJP and became one of the biggest critics of the Congress government
 1994 main karnataka, 1995 main gujarat or maharashtra main party jab chunaav jeet gai uske baad party ke tatkaaleen adhyaksh laalkrishna adwani ne vaajapeyi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya tha
 Vajpayee became Prime Minister 3 times from 1996 to 2004

 sardi ke mausam main barish kya padi farvari ke maheene main hawaaon main siharan laut ai
 The cold has returned once again in North India due to continuous intermittent rains since Monday in all areas of North India including Delhi, NCR
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik punjab, haryana or uttar pradesh ke tamaam ilaakon main aasmaan main badal umad-ghumdakar ruk-rukkar barase
 This change in weather is being seen due to western disturbances
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik mausam main aae badlaav ke liye khaas tarah kii paristhitiyaan jimmedaar hai
 While Western Disturbance is showing its effect on one side, cyclonic circulation over Gujarat on the other hand is throwing moist winds from Arabian Sea towards North India
 vahiin duusari taraf bengal kii khadi se bhi nam hawaaon kaa pravaah uttar pradesh or madhya pradesh ke upar tak aa rahaa he
 Due to this, the movement of clouds has become in a large area of the country
 jaankaro ke mutabik maujuuda paristhitiyon ke chalate kai jagahon par olavrishti kii sambhaavna he
 According to m Durai Swamy, director of the Meteorological Department, the winds have changed in North India at the moment and many areas are receiving intermittent rains, due to which the temperature of the day is seen to drop
 lihaaja logon ko acchhee khaasi thand mahasoos ho rahi he
 Although this rain is sure to disturb life, but this rain will prove to be very beneficial for the Rabi season crops
 supreme court ne ayodhya main vivaadit sthal par bane ramalala ke asthai mandir ke puraane tirpal or rassiyaan badalane kii anumati de di he
 The Bench headed by Justice Surinder Singh Nijjar granted this permission after the Center and other parties did not object to any change in the tarpaulin and ropes of the temporary temple

 The court had on May 9, 2011 stayed the implementation of the High Court's decision, terming it absurd
 nyaayalay ne kaha tha ki kisi bhi paksh ne is bhoomi ke bantwaare kii maang nahin kii thi
 The court, while ordering the status quo at the disputed site, prohibited any religious activity on the 67 acres of land adjoining it
 yah bhoomi centre sarkaar ne apane kabje main le rakhi he
 a decisive hearing in the Supreme Court on the ramjanmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute starts today
 iske saath hi raajnneetik bayaanbaji bhi shuru ho gai he
 BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has targeted Congress leader Kapil Sibal by tweeting
 swami ne sawaal uthaaya ki ''kapil sibbal court main sunni vakf board kii ore se moti fees ke chakkar main ram mandir ke khilaaf paksh rakhenge
 Some Shiva devotees! '' Kapil Sibal will be defending the claim of Sunni Wakf Board against Ram Mandir for fat fee
 Some Shiva Bakhts!!— Subramanian Swamy (@swamy39)december 5, 2017swami ne kaha ki gujarat main congress hindu or shivbhakt hone kaa daawa kar rahi he, to kya kapil sibbal aaj SC main mandir banane kii khilaafat karenge
 Rahul Gandhi tell what is his stand on Ram temple? He said that if Kapil Sibal stood against the temple in the Supreme Court, then the people of Gujarat would say to the Congress, Good bye
 gujarat main mandir-mandir rahulgauratlab he ki gujarat main rahul gandhi baar-baar kai mandiron main maathaa tech rahe hai, isi dauraan unke somnath mandir jane par vivaad hua tha
 a picture came after Rahul went to the temple, in which he signed in a non-hindu register
 haalanki, congress ne baad main safai di thi ki vah unke dastakhat nahin he
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala had said that Rahul is not only a Hindu, but a Janeudhari Hindu
 BJP netaa subramanyam swami bhi ram mandir vivaad ko lekar mukhar rahe hai
 He has filed a petition in the Supreme Court for early disposal of the case
 jis par court ne jald sunwaayee kaa bharosa bhi diya he
 Let us tell you that Subramanian Swamy has been saying repeatedly that the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya will start soon and devotees can go there till next Diwali
 ab sulajhegaa ayodhya vivaad? jaane ab tak kab-kya hua The ground has been set for the World Cup cricket and all 14 armies are ready, but all the teams except co-host India have a choice in their fifteen-member squad for the main character of the game, the wicketkeeper
 bharat ne wicketcaping main captain mahendra singh dhoni par puraa bharosa dikhaaya he, lekin yadi vah chot ke kaaran kisi match main nahin khel pate hai to phir bhartiya team ke paas iskaa koi vikalp nahin he
 In the 15-member Indian team that will participate in the World Cup to be held from February 19 to April 2, there is no player other than Dhoni who can play the responsibility behind the wicket if needed
 chayankartaaon ke is faisle se purv cricketer bhi hairaan hai, kyonki isse pehle 2003 main rahul dravid ke saath parthiv patel or 2007 main dhoni ke saath dravid ko vaikalpik wicketiper ke taur par team main rakhaa gaya tha
 This time no other team like India has taken such a risk for an important place like wicketkeeping
 chaar baar ke champion austrailia ne apni team main bread hadin or tim pen ke rup main do visheshgy wicketiper rakhe hai
 There are also at least two such players in other teams who have taken the responsibility of wicketkeeping at some point in their career
 rajasthan main congress apane ummidavaaron kii suchi jari nahin kar paa rahi he or tikat paane kii chaah rakhane waalon par ye deree minute dar minute baari pad rahi he
 It was believed that the ticket will be decided in the meeting of the Congress Working Committee on Monday
 magar rajasthan ke bade netaaon ke bich vivaad itnaa gaharaa he ki congress varking cameti kii meeting bhi tikaton ko lekar jhagada khatm nahin kar pai
 There is a fierce fight between Rajasthan Congress President Sachin Pilot and Congress General Secretary Ashok Gehlot for the ticket
 is bich khabaren aa rahi hai ki rajasthan vidhansabha main congress ke netaa pratipaksh rameshwar dudi or sachin payalat ke bich meeting main jhagada itnaa zyada bad gaya ki somvaar der raat tak ashok gahalot donon pakshon lekar maan manavdaul karte rahe or ab ek baar phir se vichaar-vimarsh chal rahaa he
 The quarrel of the Rajasthan Congress is over who will become the chief minister if the party comes to power
 tamaam tarah ke survey yah bataa rahe hai ki congress satta main aa rahi he
 In such a situation, the desire to become the Chief Minister is increasing
 rahul gandhi ne jis tarah se kisi bhi netaa ko rajasthan main aage nahin kiya he
 In such a situation, it is believed that a decision can be taken on the post of CM in the Legislature Party meeting

 It is being told that after the CWC meeting on Monday it was decided that the list of about 100 to 110 candidates will be released from the Congress at night, but in the meeting of Sonia Gandhi, Rameshwar Doody and Sachin Pilot fiercely You became me
 kuch siton par aisi garma garmi ho gai ki sachin payalat ne kaha ki agar mere kahe ke anusaar in siton par tikat nahin diya gaya to main raajnneeti chhod duungaa
 Doodling also said that if you have to leave tomorrow, then leave today, but tickets will not be distributed according to your choice
 kaha ja rahaa he ki nauhar saanwariyaa or phulera jaise siton par sachin payalat kisi or ko ladaana chaahate hai jabaki gahalot or dudi apane logon ko ladaana chaahate hai
 There are a dozen such seats where the dispute is not taking name
 dudu se babulal nagar, bhilwara kii ek seat se raamalaal jat jaise netaaon ko lekar bhi vivaad he
 Why there is a ruckus over ticket distribution? Actually, both Pilot faction and Ashok Gehlot faction wants to get tickets to at least 80 such people who help them to become Chief Minister
 iske alaava is baat ko lekar bhi abhi faisla nahin ho paa rahaa he ki ashok gahalot or sachin payalat vidhansabha chunaav ladenge
 One of the views of the party is that both big leaders should campaign while Ashok Gehlot wants to contest from his traditional seat Sardarpura while Sachin Pilot has never contested assembly elections
 kaha ja rahaa he ki gahalot gut chahta he ki sachin payalat vidhansabha chunaav laden jabaki payalat kii taraf ke netaa chaahate hai ki madhya pradesh kii tarj par donon hi bade netaa chunaav nahin lade
 But if Ashok Gehlot contests the election, then Sachin Pilot will also contest because the person who will be present in the meeting of the Legislature Party can be strengthened

 In the special program 'third Degree' till date, he said that Narendra Modi did not mind the Muslim cap, but he had covered the sheet written in the rectangle
 bihar ke bhagalpur se saansad shahanvaj ne kaha ki gujarat kii har choukhat modi se muhabbat karti he or vah musalamaanon kaa dil khol kar swaagat kar rahe hai
 Significantly, Modi once refused to wear a Muslim hat on stage
 jab shahanvaj se is bare main sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha, 'main to chahta hum ki modi apana tilak lagaaein or shahanvaj topi pahane or sab log milakar desh ke vikaas ke liye kaam karen
 He said that the Muslim cap is for worship, not for politics and no one has the right to doubt the patriotism of Muslims
 unhone daawa kiya ki muslimon ke katghare main bijepi nahin he
 Shahnawaz said that BJP is not a one-man party

 Shahnawaz said that his face is not of Muslim but of Hindustani
 unhone yah bhi daawa kiya ki tikat bantwaare main majahab mudda nahin he
 Till now the party has given tickets to 4 Muslims and the number of Muslim activists has also increased
 bijepi par dangon ke aaropon kaa jawaab dete hue unhone kaha, 'hamane dangon kii siyasat nahin kii
 How did the riots in Mulayam's rule become secular? Why was there no justice in the Congress rule? The person of any party involved in the riots should not be spared
 ' unhone kaha, 'modi sawaalon ke jawaab se nahin bachate
 Modi is busy in rallies
 modi se rahul kii tulana nahin ho sakati he
 Shahnawaz said that Advani is not weak, and has become strong, he is like the party's guardian
