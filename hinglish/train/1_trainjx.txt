 You must also spend and if you do not spend then you will need to spend further
 aise main ham aapako kuch bin maangi salaah de dete hai

 1

 In such a situation, many people get angry, and many people get very far there

 kai cabinet mantri meraa istipha chaahate hai, captain sahab bhi haar ke liye mujhe jimmedaar maan rahe hai, jabaki yah sabaki jimmedaari he

 But if you listen to the entire speech, it seems that JDU has only one aim, that Narendra Modi should not become bjp's prime ministerial candidate at any cost
 hamane sirf neshnal council kaa dayera yaad dilaayaa he
 Nitish Kumar has explained all things in detail that how a diocese cannot become a model of the country
 nitish ne yaa maine kisi vyakti vishesh kaa naam kabhi nahin liya
 You say that you have to wear a hat, tilak is also required
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki aap sampradayik bayaan dete hai?unke (nitish ke) bayaan kaa matlab he ki bharat kai tarah ke antarvirodhon se bharaa hua desh he
 In such a situation, it becomes necessary to visit the shrine or temple
 modi kahen ki ve daayre main rahane ko taiyaar hai tab bhi kya aapako unase etraj hoga?ve itane dinon se hai par unhone aisa kuch bhi ab tak kaha he kya?to aap yah kah rahe hai ki agar ek dayera tay ho jaae or us daayre main koi bhi agar chalane ko taiyaar ho jaae, to netaa ke naam par aapako koi etraj nahin he?koi us daayre main rahe, hamen koi etraj nahin he
 It seems that Nitish wants to leave the NDA and Sharad Yadav wants to stay with him
 ham logon kii raay kabhi do nahin hoti
 We decide and go
 yah rijolution maine taiyaar kiya he or bihar kii paristhitiyon ke anusaar uskaa vistaar nitish kumaar ne kiya he
 JDU and nda's relationship is deteriorating
 udhar upie koshish main he ki kisi tarah jediu ko pata liya jaae
 Center Rs 12,000 crore
 becoward rigen grant fund bihar ko dene vaala he
 Will there be a relationship with the Congress? Under the last five-year plan, the scheme was allocated Rs 5,000 crore
 mili the
 This time Rs 12,000 crore
 mili hai jabaki hamane maange the 20,000 karod rupye
 Anyway, our biggest demand is for the special state
 sarkaar vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ko taiyaar ho jaae to congress kaa daaman tham lenge?sawaal hi nahin
 The demand for a special state is the demand of the country
 iskaa rajnatik arth nahin ho saktaa
 Hearing the statement of every BJP leader, it seems that Modi is a popular leader and he will project Modi only
 nitish ne jab se hamalaa kiya, puri party lamaband ho gai
 Our alliance is with BJP
 bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh kaa aisa koi riection aayaa? na hi nitish yaa meraa aisa koi riection aayaa
 If a popular leader is emerging in the NDA then why is the JDU having so much trouble? We have never named anyone
 puri baatcheet aapachhattat

 The image of Manohar Parrikar, who rose to the rank of Defense Minister of India and Chief Minister of Goa from a RSS pracharak in his coastal home state of Goa, has been a straightforward, ordinary man
 63 varshiya parrikar ne chaar baar goa ke mukhyamantri ke rup main kaam kiya or narendra modi ke netritv vaale mantrimandal main raksha mantri ke taur par teen varsh sevaayen deen
 Parrikar, popular among all sections of the BJP as well as various parties, had played an important role in increasing the bjp's influence in Goa, a Congress stronghold for a long time
 ek madhyamvargeey parivaar main 13 disambar 1955 ko janme parrikar ne sangh ke prachaarak ke rup main apana raajnneetik kariyar aarambh kiya tha
 He continued to work for the Sangh even after graduating in engineering from iit-bombay
 manohar parrikar ko shradhanjali dene ke liye yahaan clic karen
 
 
 Parrikar had a relationship with the RSS from a very young age
 vah skool ke antim dinon main aresas ke ‚Äòmukhya shikshak‚Äô ban gaye the
 Parrikar never felt any trouble with his association with the Sangh
 unka sangh dwaara yojit ‚Äòsanchaalan‚Äô main liya gaya ek photograph isaki pushti karata he, jisamen vah sangh ke ganavesh or haath main lathi liye najar aate hai
 After completing his studies from IIT, he became a moderator at Mapusa at the age of 26
 unhone raksha mantri ke taur par apane kaarykaal main pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir main bhartiya sena ke sargical hamale kaa shrey bhi sangh kii shiksha ko diya tha
 It is believed that the BJP pulled Parrikar into politics to prevent the lead of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, the oldest regional political party in the state
 parrikar ne chunavi raajnneeti main 1994 main pravesh kiya, jab unhone panaji vidhansabha nirvachan kshetra se bhaajapa ke tikat par chunaav jeeta
 He was the Leader of the Opposition in the Goa Legislative Assembly from June to November 1999 and was known for his speeches against the then Congress-led government
 vah pehali baar 24 oktober 2000 main goa ke mukhyamantri bane lekin unka kaarykaal keval 27 farvari 2002 tak hi chalaa
 He was re-elected thereafter on June 5, 2002 and served as Chief Minister
 chaar bhaajapa vidhayakon ke 29 janvari, 2005 ko sadan se istipha dene ke baad unki sarkaar alpamat main aa gai
 After this, Pratapsingh Rane of Congress became the Chief Minister of Goa in place of Parrikar
 parrikar ke netritv vaali bhaajapa ko 2007 main digambar kaamat ke netritv vaali congress ke haathon haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 However, the year 2012 brought a wave of Parrikar's popularity in the state and he won his party 21 out of 40 seats in the assembly
 vah phir se rajya ke mukhyamantri bane
 The bjp's winning momentum continued in 2014, when the party won both Lok Sabha seats in the general election
 centre main modi ke netritv main mantrimandal ke shapath grahan karne ke baad parrikar ko november 2014 main raksha mantri kaa pad diya gaya
 He remained in the Union Cabinet till 2017
 goa vidhansabha chunaav main party ke bahumat hasil nahin kar paane par vah march 2017 main rajya laute or goa forward party evam emjeepi jaise dalon ko gathbandhan sahyogi banane main kaamyaab rahe
 His government was again formed in the state
 farvari, 2018 ke baad se unki tabiyat kharaab rahane lagi
 He was then admitted to Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai for treatment of pancreatic disease
 vah march ke pehle saptaah main ilaaj ke liye america gaye jahaan vah june tak aspataal main rahe
 After returning to the state, Parrikar resumed work and also attended the 12-day assembly session
 agast ke duusare saptaah main vah phir se upachaar ke liye america gaye or kuch dinon baad laute
 He again went to America and this time on returning from there he was admitted to AIIMS in Delhi

 However, the only media report related to this is dated December 17, published by the news agency IANS, according to which Rs 5000 crore has been sent by the RBI through a special plane in UP
 unhone kaha ki yah soochna ek adhikari se mili he jiskaa naam nahin bataaya ja saktaa
 When NDTV contacted RBI, their spokesperson clarified that the bank does not provide information about how much cash is being delivered in which state

 ' jab hamane is daawey kii pushti karne ke liye bijepi netaaon se poocha to unhone pichley dinon sthaneey akhabaaron main chhapi khabaron kaa hawala diya
 Incidentally, it was only during those days when PM Modi launched an election campaign in UP
 haalanki isse judi ek maatr media report 17 disambar kii he jo ki samachar agency IANS dwaara prakashit he jiske mutabik upi main 5 hazaar karod rupee, ek vishesh plane dwaara arabiai ne bheje hai

 jab NDTV ne arabiai se sampark kiya to unke pravaktaa ne safai di ki bank yah jaankaree detaa hi nahin he ki koun se rajya main kitni nagdi pahunchaai ja rahi he
 Despite this, local BJP mps kept pointing out that political pressure is being created on the RBI

 'singh says that he had requested the party leader to send more cash and remove people's problems
 tippaniyan Singh said, 'we told Amit Shah that the process of transferring money from RBI should be a bit faster so that people do not face much trouble
 unhone kaha tha ki usase jude sabhi taiyaariyaan kar lee gai he or paisa bhej diya jayega

 bron kaa kahana tha ki mahila ne use is baat kii manjuuri di thi ki wo sote vakt uske saath sex kar uskaa video bana saktaa he
 a bench of eight women and four men acquitted Bron after listening to all aspects during the two-day trial

 haalanki yah dekhnaa hoga ki utsarjan main katautee ke lakshyon ko hasil karne ke liye duniya ko jis bade aarthik sahyog kii jarurat he, use china puraa kar paaegaa yaa nahin
 Recently, China's economy has slowed down and is facing many new challenges
 is lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye america ne vachan diya tha ki vah 2005 kii tulana main saal 2025 tak apane green house gas utsarjan main 26 se 28 fisadi kii kami laaegaa
 This means that the US reduces its carbon dioxide emissions 7
 4 arab ton (saal 2005) se ghataakar 2 arab ton tak le aata
 By the way, the carbon dioxide emission level of America decreased to 6
 8 arab ton tak aa chukaa he
 Although Trump has not spoken of dropping the emission target despite being out of the agreement, he has stopped implementing the steps necessary to achieve this goal
 bharat ne tay kiya he kaaphi mahatvakankshi lakshpub jab america apane kadam peeche khinch chukaa he to iskaa matlab yah he ki vaishvik lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye duniya ke duusare deshon ko utsarjan katautee kaa lakshya badhanaa hoga
 This will be quite a difficult thing, because many countries like India, European Union have already set very ambitious targets in emission reductions

 The way the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) works is amazing and it can do anything
 sunne main thodaa ajeeb lagegaa, lekin is baar usne sookhe pade lon main ek hi din main hari-bhari ghaas uga di
 Residents of the new flats built in Vasant Kunj, South Delhi, were troubled by the lack of primary facilities there
 jab alotiyon ko flats saunpe gaye the to bahut se main gril or khidkiyaan bhi nahin thim
 Not only this, thousands of square feet of land there was also barren
 lekin yah khabar jab mail today par chhapi to didie harakat main aayaa or turant saikadon majdoor vahaan kaam karne lage
 From the installation of grills in the windows to painting in the doors, the work started rapidly

 Also, note that in every city where this communication is happening, the government already claims that the supply of water from the pipeline is completely safe
 iske liye baqayada certificate jari hote hai
 If the drinking water supply of cities is safe, then why are bottled water and water filters or water purifiers installed in every house? In such a situation, when the country has been in leisure by discussing the poison found in the food items under the pretext of Maggi, then there will be no harm in arguing that how much water our cities need and how much water they have
 saath hi, yah bhi ki jo pani mil rahaa he vah kitna bharosemand he
 According to doctors, a healthy person should drink eight to 12 glasses of water throughout the day
 is tarah pine ke liye har vyakti ko bamushkil dhai litre or puure desh ko pine ke liye har roj 300 karod litre pani kii jarurat he
 In such a situation, if the three dams like Tehri dam (capacity 4 cubic kilometers or 40,000 crore liters) are used for drinking the entire water, then a year of drinking water can be available for the 120 crore population of the country
 or phir hamaare desh main to saikadon baandh, hajaaron nadiyaan or 6 lakh se adhik talab maujuud hai, to pani kii killat kyon? or kyon is desh main aaj bhi 70 fisadi bimariyon kaa taalluk kahin na kahin ashuddh jal ke seven se he
 The question of water scarcity is all these questions because the mathematics of water in the country is not as straightforward as it seems from above
 darasal bharat main peyajal or gharelu jarurat ke pani kii supplai kaa alag-alag dhaancha nahin he
 In such a situation, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has estimated the daily water requirement for every person from 150 liters to 200 liters
 udhar, badhati aabaadi ke anupaat main prati vyakti pani kii uplabdhta ghatati ja rahi he
 According to official figures, during the time of independence in 1947, per capita 6,042 cubic meters of water was available annually, after the 2011 census, this availability was reduced to just 1,545 cubic meters i

 The data presented by the Ministry of Urban Development in the Lok Sabha about water supply in 35 major cities clearly shows that 30 cities are getting less water than they need
 vahiin, 2021 main pani kii maang ke hisaab se aapurti ke liye kiye ja rahe daawey hawaii hai (dekheh 35 shaharon main pani kii maang or aapurti or bhavishya main pani kii maang kaa nakshaa)
 Regarding water supply in 2021, most cities have said that the industry will arrange water for itself
 mek in india jaise abhiyaan agar safal hone hai to udyog kii is chunauti kaa koi thos jawaab hona chahie
 Taking this question further, environmental activist Anupam Mishra asks, "the government is already showing the demand for water in cities and this reduced demand is not being met
 shaharon kaa bada hissaa boring ke jariye bhoojal kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 Due to this, the level of ground water is falling rapidly
 '' tatkaaleen yojana ayog dwaara 2012 se 2017 ke liye shahari or audyogic jal supplai par taiyaar report ke mutabik ''ek lakh se adhik aabaadi vaale shaharon main 73 fisadi logon ko hi pine ke pani kii aapurti ho paa rahi he
 40 to 50 percent of the water supply claimed is 'disappeared'
 '' 12veen panchavarshiya yojana ke liye jal aapurti ke liye bane visheshgy samooh ke mutabik peyajal aapurti main nitigat str par badi khamiyaan hai
 The report said that today no city wants to make its reservoirs part of its water supply
 iske badale in jalaashyon ko keemtee jameen kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 This land pit is first filled with garbage and then taken to real estate
 jalashay ke cachament aria main shahar se baahar phenk die gaye garib atikaraman kar lete hai
 And in the end it gets captured by the rich, who use it in any work from building a house to building an airport
 nitigat rup se is paristhiti main badlaav karne kii jarurat he
 Here, Mishra reminds how in the construction of Delhi Airport, 7 ponds were abolished, which are used to recharge the source of drinking water or ground water
 pani kii barabaadiek taraf shahar apane jal sroton ko nasht kar rahe hai, to duusari taraf milon dur se shahar tak pani laane vaali vyavastha main raste main hi pani kii bandarbaant ho jaati he
 Just look at the excerpt of the same report of the Planning Commission about Nagpur city of Maharashtra - 765 MLD water for Nagpur 40 km from the city
 dur 'pench van evam tiger rigerv' se aata he
 140 MLD of this water is spent in the canal itself
 125 emeldi pani kachche pani ke treetment ke baad bekaar ho jaataa he
 235 MLD of water disappears during pipeline supply and due to water theft
 iske alaava 45 emeldi pani ke bill kii vasuuli nahin ho paati
 In this way, the city is able to charge only 200 MLD water bill
 planning kamishan spasht karata he ki jo haal nagpur kaa he, kamobesh yahi haal desh ke sabhi shaharon main peyajal supplai kaa he
 That is why suburban areas of big cities are deprived of pipelines and there are long queues in front of municipal water tankers
 jahaan pani pahunchataa bhi he, vahaan iske svachh hone ko lekar hajaar tarah ke andeshe ghule rahete hai
 Invitation to diseases This theft and destruction of diseases invite diseases in two ways
 pipe line li kar rahi ho yaa isse pani chori kiya jaae to usamen bacteria aane kaa andeshaa bana rahata he
 There have also been cases when sewer water gets mixed into drinking water due to such reasons
 bhale hi ye maamle ine-gine hon, lekin inase logon ke man main dar to samaa hi jaataa he
 Secondly, people in areas where water does not reach, randomly exploit ground water
 ensiaar main gudgaanv, noida, gajiabad or faridabad main isi kaaran teji se bhoojal khatm ho rahaa he
 According to the Central Ground Water Board, the excessive exploitation of groundwater has led to arsenic, chloride and other types of impurities in the ground water in large areas of the country
 (dekhen nakshaa) inke kaaran boring yaa handpump kaa pani bahut surakshit nahin rah jaataa
 All these reasons pose a risk of waterborne diseases
 is par palatwaar karte hue dilli jal board (dijebi) main quality control se jude ek varisht adhikari sawaal karte hai, ''jal board vishwa swasthya sanghathan (dablyuechao) ke maanakon se behatar pani supplai kar rahaa he or har roj pani kii shuddhta ke 100 se adhik namoonay liye jate hai
 But we do not have a publicity system like private companies and neither Hema Malini is guaranteeing our product
 '' unka daawa he ki kuch apriy ghatnaon ko aadhaar banaakar pani mafia jalaapurti karne vaali sarkari sansthaaon ko badnaam karata he or apana kaarobaar failaata he
 Water business but these fears eventually lead to the water business
 udyogon ke liye research karne vaali nijee sanstha velunots kii report 'homewater purifaire industry 2014-19' ke mutabik yah kaarobaar 22 fisadi kii vruddhi dar darj kar rahaa he
 The size of the home water purifier industry in 2014 was Rs 3,400 crore

 Will exceed the figure of report kai dilachasp tathyon kii ore ishaara karti he, jaise water purifaire kii sabase zyada bikri june ke ant or july kii shuruyaat yani monsoon kii aamad ke samay hoti he
 Actually, this is also the time when waterborne diseases spread the most and floods in rivers increase the turbidity of the supply water
 report ek or dilachasp tathy kii ore ishaara karti he ki raipur main pichley saal water purifaire kii bikri main 40 fisadi kaa oochaal tab aayaa, jab shahar main pilia kaa prakope tha
 "such a clear trend shows that there has been a sharp increase in sales of water purifiers in areas where waterborne diseases have been affected," Priyali Shah, the research analyst who prepared the report, told India Today
 ''pani ke kaarobaar kaa doosraa hissaa he bottleband pani
 According to the report of the industrial body Assocham, in 2013, the bottled water business in the country was Rs 7,000 crore

 This is 71% of the total sanctioned schemes of 64,882 crore in JNNURM during the same period

 Standard SMS Charges Applicable ‚Äù In Maharashtra, Ajit Pawar formed government with BJP, Ajit Pawar broke NCP, Supriya Sule bid-broke party: In Maharashtra, the formation of a coalition government of Shiv sena-ncp and Congress was happening that Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar of BJP Together they formed the government
 devendra fadanvis siem ban gaye hai or ajit pavaar upmukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee he
 However, NCP chief Sharad Pawar has made it clear that this is not our party's decision
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki maharashtra ke maratha kshatrap kahe jane vaale sharad pavaar ke siyaasi viraasat par kabiz hone ke liye ajit pavaar ne aakhirkaar ensipi ko tod hi diya he
 After Sharad Pawar, Supriya Sule has also said that NCP has broken
 supriya ne kaha ki parivaar or party bant gai he
 Ajit Pawar's decision to support the BJP may be seen adding to the discord of the Sharad family
 haalanki, sharad pavaar kii siyaasi viraasat kaa asal uttaradhikari ajit pavaar hi maane jate rahe he
 Desired to become deputy CM in 2009, Ichhajit is seen as an aspiring leader in Maharashtra and is believed to have all the qualities to become the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 maharashtra main saal 2009 main hue vidhansabha chunaavon ke thik baad ajit ne up mukhyamantri banane kii ichha jataai thi
 However, during that time Chhagan Bhujbal was elected to the post of Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 maharashtra kii siyasat main badlaav hua
 In December 2010, Ajith's wish came true and he became Deputy Chief Minister
 phir saal 2013 main unka naam ek vivaad se judaa
 Ajit's name cropped up in an irrigation scam and he was then forced to resign from his post
 haalanki, baad main dobaaraa ajit pavaar dipti siem bane
 Instead of Ajit Pawar, daughter preferred, Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule entered politics and established herself
 sharad pavaar ab ajit pavaar kii jagah apni beti supriya sule ko adhik tarjeeh de rahe the
 He wanted to hand over his political legacy to Supriya Sule, Ajit Pawar also knew this well, so he thought it better to secure his political future and decided to form a government with BJP by breaking NCP
 ajit pavaar ko aisa lagane laga ki unhen ab kam tarjeeh mil rahi he
 Meanwhile, the NCP took out a yatra against the bjp-shiv Sena government of Maharashtra, but instead of handing it over to Ajit Pawar, Sharad Pawar had given two other leaders of the party
 ajit ke dil main yah baat pakke taur par ghar kar gai ki unhen kinare lagane kii koshish ho rahi he, isliye ajit pavaar ne chunaav se vidhansabha kii sadsyta se istipha de diya tha
 On the same day it was proved that everything was not going well in the Pawar family
 raajnneetik uttaradhikari koun hoga?haalanki, supriya sule pehle pradesh kii raajnneeti main dhyaan nahin detii thim
 She used to be active in her parliamentary constituency Baramati, but the way she was active in this election and came together with her father shoulder to shoulder
 isi ke saath yah sawaal uthne laga tha ki ensipi main sharad pavaar kaa raajnneetik uttaradhikari koun hoga? ajit pavaar yaa supriya sule?haalanki, us vakt supriya ne kaha tha ki ajit pavaar unke bade bhai hai or ve hamaare netaa hai
 My area of work would be limited to Delhi, after which these discussions had come to an end, but the way Ajit Pawar has broken the party and formed the government, it is seen as a battle to hold on to Pawar's legacy

 The BJP retained this victory in 2009 and 2014 as well
 in chunaavon main bhi bhaajapa ko 11 main se 10 siton par jeet mili thi
 The Congress could win only Korba seat (charandas Mahant) in 2009 and Durg seat (tamradhwaj Sahu) in 2014
 lekin is varsh hone ke vaale loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ke liye is jeet ko kaayam rakh paanaa aasaan nahin he
 In the recently held assembly elections, Congress won 68 of the 90 seats in the state, BJP in 15 seats and Ajit Jogi's party Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) and BSP alliance in seven seats

 Ramesh Nayyar, a senior journalist and political journalist in the state, says that the BJP has suffered a major defeat in the tribal seats in the last assembly elections
 bhaajapa se jo bhi adivasee netaa chunaav jite hai vah apane prabhaav ke kaaran jite hai
 In such a situation, it is difficult to say that Vikram Usendi will be able to make much impact on these seats

 In the state with about 32 percent tribal population, how much influence Usendi can make in this election will tell the time to come

 LIVE chat karen The monsoon showers are very likely in August and September
 mausam vibhaag ne monsoon ke duusare hisse ke liye yani agast or sitambar maheene ke liye chetavanee jari karke kaha he ki agast ke maheene saamaanya ke mukaable 95 fisadi se lekar 113 fisadi tak kii barish kii sambhaavna he
 This simply means that in the month of August, there will be around 104 per cent of the normal rainfall, which means there is a possibility of more rain than normal in this month
 agast ke baad monsoon kii barish kaa jor bana rahegaa or sitambar ke maheene main is baar monsooni ghataaen jhum kar barasengi
 The probability of good rains in the next two months, according to the weather department, is likely to be between 102 per cent and 110 per cent of normal this time in the month of September
 iskaa sidhaa matlab ye hua ki sitambar ke maheene main saamaanya ke mukaable takreeban 106 fisadi barish hone kii sabase zyada sambhaavna he
 It is important to note that the Meteorological Department considers the rainfall in June, July, August and September to be monsoon rain
 monsoon kii barish kaa aadha sijan guzar chukaa he or june-july main monsoon kii barish kii sau fisadi barish hui he
 Therefore, the possibility of good rains in the next two months directly means that this time the monsoon rains are more likely than normal
 mausam vibhaag kii bhavishyavaaneemausam vibhagaki bhavishyavaanee ke mutabik agast-sitambar ke dauraan desh bhar main 107 fisadi barish hone kii sambhaavna he
 In this, the 8% model error is a lapse
 iskaa matlab ye hua ki agast-sitambar ke dauraan 99 fisadi se lekar 115 fisadi tak barish sambhav he
 In the coming days, the possibility of floods being higher than normal in august-september means that there is a high probability of flooding in North India, East India, Central India and West India
 jaankaron ke mutabik, june-july kii barish saamaanya rahane kaa matlab ye hua ki desh ke zyaadaatar ilaakon main utani barish ho rahi he jitani honi chahie
 This directly meant that there is sufficient amount of moisture in the ground in most areas across the country
 aise main or zyada barish ko jameen sokh nahin paaegi lihaaja zyaadaatar ilaakon main baadh kaa khatra agast sitambar main badha rahegaa
 There are favorable seasonal conditions for the monsoon across the world, behind the possibility of the monsoon being above normal
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik monsoon ke bache hue maheenon main prashanth mahaasaagar main neutral taapmaana bane rahenge
 Apart from this, there is a high probability of Indian Ocean diapole ie IOD being positive

 dilli police ne ek naaballig serial killer kaa pardaafash karne main safalataa hasil kii he
 This minor killer had been committing murders since the age of 14 and had become so barbaric that after killing, he used to put salt and bury the corpse so that the corpse was completely melted and the police had no clue of the murder
 is naaballig serial killer ne hatya kii apni sajishon main apane bhaaiyon ko bhi shaamil kar liya tha
 Many more boys joined his gang
 unamem bhi kuch hatyare sage bhai hai
 The Sangam Vihar police recovered a corpse in exactly the same state last year
 police hatya kii us gutthi ko tab tak nahin sulajhaa pai thi, jab tak is serial killer ne khud apni jubaan se hatya kii us vaardaat kaa khulaasa nahin kar diya
 The minor serial killer told that a woman had given her contract to kill her brother
 supaari lekar is serial killer ne mahila ke bhai kaa apharan kiya or goli markar uski hatya kar di
 But he did not stop at that
 usne petrol chhidakkar laash ko pehle jala diya phir dafnane se pahalelash par dher sara namak daldia taaki laash puri tarah gal jaae
 Police found the body in a very skeletal state
 police ke mutabik, 17 saal kaa yah naaballig serial killer 14 saal kii umr se hi jurm kii duniya main utar gaya tha
 During the course of these three years, after committing the crime, he along with his accomplices committed many murders
 police ne naaballig serial killer sahit chaar badmaashon ko giraftaar kiya he, jinamein ek mahila bhi shaamil he
 The police will now interrogate them and extract all the crimes committed so far
 jin aparaadhon kaa usne khulaasa kiya he, unki phir se tafteesh kii jaaegi
 Police said that in 2015, a serial killer killed a person due to enmity and took the corpse to the forest and buried it
 pichley saal bhi usne ek vyakti kii hatya kii supaari lee thi
 Within the last one week, this serial killer had kidnapped three youths and was about to kill them
 10 janvari ko usne apane saathiyon ke saath milakar do yuvakon kaa mobile or bike chin unki hatya karne sangam vihaar ke jangalon kii ore le gaya tha
 However, the police saw them doing this and on being warned, the crooks ran away leaving both the youths
 lekin in badmaashon ke hausale itane buland the ki agle hi din unhone phir seek yuvak kaa aparankar liya or use bhi markar dafnane jangal kii ore le gaye
 Once again, the police took action and not only saved the kidnapped young man from the clutches of the miscreants, but also arrested his three other associates including the serial killer
 yah to sirf bharat main hota tha ki varsha dev ko khush karne ke liye mendhakon kii shaadi rachaai jaati thi yaa ki kanyaon ke bhavi patiyon ke jivan se anisht taalane ke liye unhen ped yaa jaanwaron se byaah diya jaataa tha
 But this case is slightly different
 47 saal kii ek talakshuda british mahila amanda rogers ne apni bharosemand paaltu kutiya sheba se shaadi kar lee
 The wedding is said to have taken place in August 2012 in Split, Croatia, in front of 200 people
 vah bataati hai, 'sheba meri jindagi main kai saal se he
 She makes me laugh when i feel bad
 mujhe behatar mahasoos karwaati he
 i do not expect anything else from a life partner
 'kareeb 20 saal pehle amanda kii shaadi hui thi, jo kuch maheenon main hi tut gai
 This time Amanda wanted everything to be okay, so, in her own words, 'I bent down on my knees and proposed it
 usne puch hilaakar haa kah di
 'but when asked whether this marriage is legal, Amanda says,' i know this marriage will not be considered in legal terms
 lekin yah acha tarika tha yah bataane kaa ki sheba kii meri jindagi main kitni ahmiyat he
 Sheba has never been tough on me
 vah hameshaa khush rahati he

 ' medical council of india (MCI) ne undergraduate medical karikulam main kuch sanshodhan kiye hai
 This change occurred for the first time in 17 years in the MBBS syllabus
 nae silebus ke mutabik ab first year ke students keval theoritkal nolej nahin lengen balki marijon ke cese bhi handle karenge
 At a press conference held in Chennai recently, MCI Chief Consultant Dr m Rajalakshmi said that the revision work going on in the quality enhancement process of the existing curriculum of MBBS is almost complete
 philhal MCI copirite ke liye aavedan karne main vyast he taaki silebus ko website par daalaa ja sake
 According to information received from an MCI source, MCI had sent the proposed syllabus named 'vision 2015' to the Health Minister in 2011 but it could not be implemented due to the controversy
 iske baad doctoron kii sarvocch niamak sanstha ne 2014 main silebus main waapas se sanshodhan kar taaja sanskaran jamaa kiya he
 In 1997 the MBBS Curriculum saw the need for major reforms, in view of which the duration of the academic year for the first year was reduced from 18 months to 12 months
 iske saath hi 2007 main medical shiksha main nae concepts ko laayaa gaya , lekin nae concept ko keval maujuuda silebus main joda gaya tha
 Currently MCI has taken a new initiative besides updating syllabus
 MCI ne medical teachers kii training kaa prastaav bhi rakhaa he
 It is being speculated that with the help of the new Karikalam, the kind of medical education that has been given to the students and the qualification that is being built so far will change
 students ko ab kalinicl practice ke liye second year main jane kaa intjaar nahin karnaa hoga balki ab first year main hi kalinicl practice kii suvidha muhaiyaa karai jaaegi
 Dr
 Dhyakani Selvakumar, the Conqueror of the Regional Center of MCI located at Christian Medical College, Vellore, said that in the first year of medicine, only in most colleges, the theory is taught, but in view of the present time, we have to introduce students to patients as soon as possible They can gain practical knowledge
 nae silebus ke mutabik radiology or surgery ko bhi medical ke pehle saal main padhaayaa jayega, jisase embibies doctoron ko clinical evaluation main diagnostic or analitical compitence kii jaankaree viksit hogi
 According to Dr Selvakumar, MCI realizes that there is a need for change in undergraduate medical education as it is not necessary that students who study MBBS should also do PG
 kai students aise bhi hote hai jo embibies ke baad practice karte hai or practice main jane vaale students ke liye nayaa silebus kaaphi madadgaar sabit hoga
 Apart from this, doctors and students believe that it takes a lot of time to read the existing syllabus, which is of no use to the students doing specialization later
 sutron ke mutabik nae silebus main 17 atirikt vishay honge

 camere par kaid maulaviyon ke khilaaf unheen ke ilaake ke logon main aakrosh dikhaai diya
 These people, who used to talk about nikah-e-hallala with hidden money, now appeared on the camera
 bulandshahr ke tilgaav main mewatian masjid kaa khud ko imam bataane vaale jahirullah ko lekar logon kaa kahana tha ki usne gaanv ke saath kaum kaa naam bhi kharaab kiya
 In the sting operation shown on Aaj Tak / India Today on Wednesday, the reality of Zaheerullah had reached the villagers' house but he was missing from the house
 gaanv waalon ke mutabik jahirullah kisi masjid kaa imam nahin he
 Many years ago he was the Imam of the mosque, but was removed
 gaanv waalon ne bataaya ki jahirullah taabeej aadi bechaa karata he or usne laalach main aakar hi ye sab kaha
 Zaheerullah's wife Afroza appeared to be avoiding speaking more in this matter
 aafroja kii patni ne mana ki jahirullah ne jo bhi kaha wo galat kaha
 Afroza said that he does not know that his husband has been getting married
 jahirullah guuruuvaar ko saamne aayaa
 Zaheerullah said, 'I did not know that those people were from the media
 maine ye kabhi nahin kaha ki main halaala karaaunga
 i only spoke about marriage
 wo aarif tha jo halaala ke liye taiyaar tha
 i did not even introduce Arif
 agar aap kah rahe hai ki maine pese or nikaah halaala kii baat kahi to main nahin jaanata
 i just told them about the process of nikah halala
 ‚Äôsting oparation main hapur jile ke pilkhuva ke sikheda gaanv me madrasa chalaane vaale mohammad jaahid kii hakeekat bhi khul kar saamne ai thi
 Zahid, like a professional, had asked to charge between one lakh and one and a half lakhs to render his service for nikah-e-hallala
 jaahid ko aisa kehete hue chupe camere se kaid kiya gaya tha
 Zahid has been missing since his opening
 usne apana phone bhi band kar rakhaa he
 According to Zahid's wife Hasina, he came home at 11:30 pm and left at 5 am
 haalanki hasina ne ye bhi kaha ki uske pati ke nikaah-e-halaala main shaamil hone kii baat pehle kabhi nahin suni gai
 The sting operation of Aaj Tak / India Today has also exposed the face of Mohammad Mustakim, who trained in the Darul Uloom Mahmudia Madrasa located in the Brahmapuri area of delhi
 mustakeem ne under cover reporters ke saamne mana tha ki wo pehle teen nikaah-e-halaala main shaamil rah chukaa he
 The team of Aaj Tak / India Today reached Mahmudiamdar in Brahmapuri on Thursday, there was none other than small children
 madrase ke aasapaas rahane vaale logon ko bhi nahin pataa tha ki mustakeem kahaan hai
 in the Nikah Halala sting, on Thursday categorically denied that Nikah had demanded any money for Halala
 haalanki wo chupe camere par paiso kii maang karata saaf kaid hua tha
 The leaders told Halala, till today, on the reality shown in the sting operation of India Today, Union Minister of State for Law and Justice PP Chaudhary said that anything that causes sexual injustice, violates fundamental rights or violates human rights It is not constitutional
 vahiin kendriya alpsankhyak kalyaan mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha ki desh kaa samvidhan gender equity or sabhi ko samanta ke adhikaar kii baat kahata he
 Whoever violates it is not acceptable
 nakvi ne kaha ki unhone nikaah-e-halaala par sting nahin dekha isliye pratikriya nahin de saktaa
 However, Naqvi termed the triple talaq as unconstitutional
 manipur kii rajyapal najma hepatulla ne kaha ki ye bilkul galat he or islam main halaala jaisi koi baat nahin he
 Najma said that Islam is not Sharia
 islam quran or haddees he
 The Qur'an and Hadith does not mention anything like nikah-e-halala
 teen talaak par pabandi se rukegaa halaala !ajtak / india today par dikhaae gaye sting ko lekar mumbai main bhartiya muslim mahila andolan (bimeme) kii sansthaapak noorjahan niaj ne kaha ki is bare main ham lambey samay se sunate aa rahe hai
 Many women come to our center and tell about this
 kuch purushon ne bhi is bare main bataaya
 The voice should be raised against such things from the community itself
 iske alaava iskaa koi vidhik upaay dhundte hue ise avaidhanik ghoshit kiya janaa chahie
 The law should be codified for Muslims just as Hindu marriage is Kodlagu
 isamen naa sirf halaala balki anya muddon ko bhi shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 Nur Jahan said that men and women will not come forward to file cases against such things because people trust the Ulema and Kazis with their eyes closed and take every word of them seriously
 ye log jaanate hai ki ye quran kaa hissaa nahin he
 Nor does it have any religious basis
 agar teen talaak jaisi pratha par court kii ore se roak laga di jaati he to ye (nikaah halaala) apane aap hi ruk jayega
 Nur Jahan said that things like nikah-e-halala are heard more in the northern states
 noorjahan kaa sanghathan islam ke fremawork main rah kar mahilaon ke liye samaan naagarikta adhikaar or langik nyaay kii maang uthaata he

 Two superstars of the chess world Vishwanathan Anand and Magnus Carlson are face to face again after a year
 or daanv par he vishwa champion kaa taj or 10 karod rupee kii inami rakam bhi
 When so much is at stake, these chess players have done a lot of preparation
 kai maheenon kii shaareerik or maansik training ke baad ek baar anand or kalarsan bisaat kii badshahath kii jang ladane ko taiyaar hai
 This time the competition is taking place in Sochi city of Russia
 yaheen shanivaar se shatranj kii badshahath kii jang shuru hogi
 There will be 12 contestants in the championship
 isamen har jeet par ek ank milenge, jabaki drow mukaable main aadha‚àíaadha ank, jis khilaadi ko pehle 6
 Will score 5 points, he will become World Champion
 agar aap soch rahe ho ki donon khiladiyon ke 6‚àí6 ank hon to champion koun banegaa, aisi surat main muqabla tibraker main jayega jahaan shatranj kii baziyaan penlti shoot out kii raftaar main kheli jaaengi, lekin aisa tabhi hoga, jab donon khilaadi apana joardaar pradarshan dikhaaenge
 Vishwanathan Anand is in full rhythm this year
 world championships main carlson ko chunauti dene kii paatrata hasil karne vaale chalanger toornament main unhone duniya ke tamaam duusare diggajon ko haraaya he
 It is expected that he will challenge Carlson, but it will not be so easy, because when Carlson is in his rhythm, no other player is expected to stand in front of him
 pichley saal chennai main vah anand ko haraakar ise jaahir kar chuke hai
 This is the reason why the first bet is being considered very important
 agar carlson yah muqabla jeet lete hai to anand ke liye vaapasi behad mushkil hogi, vahiin duusari ore agar anand shuruaati baaziyon ko drow rakhane main kaamyaab hue to ve kabhi bhi carlson kii ekaagratha ko diga sakate hai
 It is clear that the experience in the World Chess Championship is full of enthusiasm, who will win who will keep himself till the last moment

 During the Indian independence movement in 1931, revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were hanged on 23 March itself
 23 march ko shahid diwas (shaheed Diwas) ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Bhagat Singh has been such a soldier of the freedom movement, who gets excited in the body as soon as he is mentioned and his hair gets erected
 khud ko deshbhakti ke jazbe se bharne ke liye unka naam lenaa hi kaaphi he
 Bhagat Singh took the iron from the British and tried to awaken them from their sleep by throwing bombs in the assembly, they did not run away after throwing the bombs in the assembly and as a result he was hanged
 jis din bhagat singh (bhagat Singh) or baaki shaheedon ko faansee di gai thi, us din lahore jail main band sabhi kaidiyon kii ankhen nam ho gayi
 Even the staff and officers of the jail were shivering hands to hang the noose in this red neck of the earth
 jail ke niyam ke mutabik faansee se pehle teenon desh bhakton ko nahalaaya gaya tha
 They were then dressed in new clothes in front of the executioner
 jisane inkaa vajan liya
 Before being hanged, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were asked their last wishes
 teenon ne ek swar main kaha ki ham aapas main gale milanaa chaahate hai
 Bhagat Singh wrote in his last letter before hanging (shaheed Bhagat Singh), 'friends, it is natural that i should have the desire to live as well
 main ise chhipaana nahin chahta hum, lekin main ek shart par jinda rah saktaa hum ki kaind hokar yaa paband hokar na rahun
 My name has become a symbol of the Indian Revolution
 krantikari dalon ke aadarshon ne mujhe bahut ooncha uthaa diya he, itnaa ooncha ki jivit rahane kii sthiti main main isse ooncha nahin ho saktaa tha
 Mothers of the country will expect Bhagat Singh of their children in the event of me laughing
 isse aazaadee ke liye qurbaani dene waalon kii taadaad itani bad jaaegi ki kranti ko rokna naammumkin ho jayega
 Nowadays i am very proud of myself
 ab to badi betaabi se antim pariksha kaa intjaar he
 Wish it gets closer
