 On his birthday, he knew about the 5 best films of his life - 1-sent Frye (2007) - it was a comedy
 film main rajat kapur ke alaava vinay pathak or ranvir shori ne bhi abhinay kiya tha

 5-aankhen Dekhi (2014) - This film is the most successful film of Rajat Kapoor's life
 bataa den ki film main mukhya role sanjay mishra ne play kiya tha par film kii khaas baat ye he ki film kii patakatha bhi rajat kapur ne likhi thi or wo iske nirdeshak bhi the

 Can the industrial development of the area be cut off by the problem of Keshubhai and the farmers? Or will jobs and employment wrapped up in electoral issues show some mirror? Can Keshubhai and farmers face the problem of industrial development in the area? Or will there be some other mirror-wrapped jobs and jobs in electoral issues? Gujarat's development is seen from roads to industry, but the opponents call it a deception of the eyes
 modi sarkaar ko apane dhaanche par bharosa he
 They are contesting on the issue of development, and opponents are trying to prove it as a hoax
 duniya ke sabase tezi se vikaas karne vaale shaharon main rajkot ne apana naam darj karaayaa he
 There is no doubt that Rajkot has seen development but has also seen some incomplete promises
 hakeekat or fasaane kaa faasla kabhi kabhi bayanon main ulajh jaataa he
 It is seen in the mirror of development figures - but in the election clouds, the picture is sometimes not clear
 gujarat kaa teesraa sabase bada shahar rajkot baari or laghu udyog se sajaa he
 The help from the World Bank has changed the face of the city

 Despite this, there are a total of 15,000 large small brass factories in the city

 But for most of the people still living in this city, this industry is the source of employment
 haal ke dinon main kai factriyon ko band hone par majaboor hona padaa
 But people are not responsible for this but the policies of the Center and the economic downturn
 pichley 6-7 maheenon main takreeban 200 choti companiyon ko taala lag gaya
 Opposition parties say that this is the result of the policies of the government, but people associated with the industry do not say so
 haalanki modi virdohi kehete hai ki saurashtra ilaake main udyog kii pareshaaniyaan is barsarkaar kii peshaani par bal daalengi
 Surprisingly in the journey to Saurashtra, it was surprising that even the people involved in the problem did not openly oppose the state government
 jane ye kisi khauf kii vajah se tha yaa santosh ke kaaran
 But let's go to the Gir forests - where fear is not human
 congress ko agar modi kii haar kaa bharosa he to kisaanon or keshubhai ke saath-saath wo maldhariyon ke asantosh par bhi daanv laga rahe hai
 Many villages of Maldaris are settled in Beeaban of Gir with the king of the jungle
 gir ke jangalon main bichon-bich maldhariyon ke 34 gaanv yani tribal pokets maujuud hai
 Their importance in terms of elections is such that polling booths are sent to them at the time of voting
 jo maldhari shahar kii ore nikal gaye wo to vot kii alag raajnneeti main ulajh gaye
 But the rest are unanimous on caste grounds
 haa itnaa jarur he ki hameshaa se jangalon main basane ke baavjood, unki raay sateek bhi he or tatasth bhi
 Well, issues and issues are the need of the common man
 rajaneta to daavon or vaadon kii duniya basaate hai
 And sometimes these claims are seen in the form of bogey statements in election fiasco
 gujarat congress adhyaksh modwadiya ne haal hi main modi ko bandar kah daalaa to sabane bhartsana kii
 There was a lot of ruckus
 modi ke prashansak to unhen sher maanate hai gujarat kaa sher
 History has shown that Saurashtra is not very surprised
 nishkarsh se purv sanket zarur detaa he
 The only problem is that the smell of reality is silenced in the fragrance of the signs many times
 ek ahm baat yeh he ki fogat bahanon or unke pita mahavir fogat par ban rahi film dangal par bhi iskaa asar pad saktaa he
 The film is to be released after the Rio Olympics

 The Modi government will declare triple talaq as a crime and introduce a bill for imprisonment for it in the Lok Sabha today
 bill kaa naam he ‘da muslim vimen protection of ritis in marij act’
 a political debate on this bill will be held in Parliament, but opposition from Muslim society has also started
 sarkaar jis vidheyak ko muslim mahilaon ke haq ke liye krantikari bataa rahi he, uske praavdhaanon ko lekar muslim sanghathanon se lekar muslim personal lau board ashankit he or kuch sawaal ke saath-saath apattiyaan bhi hai, jise lekar wo virodh kar rahe hai
 These are the objections of the Personal Board on the provisions of the Bill
 Question: 1-the Supreme Court has held it illegal to grant three divorces at a time
 yani jab teen talaak mana hi nahin jayega to uske liye sajaa kis baat kii di jaaegi?2- tripal talaak ke saath sarkaar talaak ke anya praavdhaanon ko bhi khatm karnaa chaahati he
 Divorce is the right of Muslim men to Sharia
 sarkaar is adhikaar ko kaise chin sakati he?3-talaak kaa maamla civil act ke tahat aata he, jise sarkaar bill ke jariecriminal actabana rahi he
 If this happens, will not the scope of reconciliation between husband and wife end after divorce? 4-the government wants to interfere in the Islamic Sharia through this bill
 muslim samudaay ko apane dharm ke hisaab se jeene kaa adhikaar samvidhan se mila he
 Is this bill not a violation of religious freedom and constitutional right of Muslims? 5-modi government is bringing a bill for Muslims, but it did not talk to any party of Muslims
 na muslim dharmaguruon se, na muslim mahila sanghathanon se or na muslim personal lau board se
 How can the government make laws for them without consulting Muslims? The 6-bill also provides for the custody of children that the children will remain with the mother
 isse garib pariwaron par boj badhegaa, jo mahilaayein bacchon ko saath nahin rakhana chaahati, unhen majaburi main bacchon ko rakhana padegaa
 Poverty of Muslim women is well known
 7-nae bill ke praavdhaan ke tahat koi anjaan vyakti bhi teen talaak ko lekar shikaayat kar saktaa he, isamen patni kii shikaayat jaruri nahin rakhi gai he
 In such a situation, even if the wife does not want her husband to go to jail, she will be sent to jail on the complaint of someone else
 aise main parivaar tut jaaenge8-teen talaak dekar jab pati jail chalaa jayega to uski patni ko guzaara bhatta koun or kaise degaa? Rajesh Jain of Delhi, who has received several awards from the Ministry of Textiles as a handicraft exporter, has also started a bang as a filmmaker

 They jump from one party to another like a frog, ideologies are left behind, chair fascination becomes paramount
 vaise to ye pravritiyaan hameshaa hi rahati hai, magar chunaav ke mausam main khulkar saamne aati hai
 Till tomorrow, those who keep saying good and bad suddenly become the best
 tazaa vakya he gautam buddha nagar se congress ke ummidavaar ramesh chandra tomars kaa
 He has been a BJP MP, but was angered by Rajnath Singh's entry from the Ghaziabad seat in 2009 from the BJP and joined the Congress
 is baar ke chunaav main congress ne inhen gautam buddha nagar se tikat diya
 Were busy preaching loudly
 achaanak raaton-raat paala badal liya
 Just a week before the vote, he left the Congress and joined the BJP
 bhale hi bijepi ke liye ramesh chandra tomars ek trophy hon, jinhen vijeta ke andaaz main bijepi ne narendra modi kii indirapuram kii raily main dikhaaya ho, magar raajnneeti ke liye yah ek sharmnaak vakya he
 In the politics of 'aya Ram Gaya Ram', the leaders were seen changing the face before winning or fighting elections, but during such an election there are few such stories of changing the frost
 vah bhi tab jab kisi netaa ne party kii ore se parchaa bharaa ho
 The same happened in Bhind in Madhya Pradesh
 congress ne bhagirath prasad ko vahaan se apana ummidavaar ghoshit kiya tha, magar vah congress chhodkar bijepi main shaamil ho gaye or bijepi ne unhen apana ummidavaar bana liya
 Bhagirath Prasad may also consider the case a little different, as he left the Congress on the day the Congress made him its candidate
 unke bijepi main shaamil hone ke baad congress ne vahaan doosraa ummidavaar maidan main utaar diya, lekin ramesh chandra tomars kaa maamla to bilkul alag he
 Despite joining the BJP, he is still a Congress candidate
 10 april ko gautam buddha nagar ke matadaata jab vot dene jaaenge, to iviem par unhen ramesh chandra tomars kaa naam dikhegaa or unke naam ke aage haath ke panje kaa nishaan rahegaa
 Congress now has no choice but to declare its support to another party candidate
 dilachasp baat yah he ki agar tomars chunaav jeet jate hai, to vah congress ke saansad honge
 In such a situation, their membership can also go away immediately, because they can be prosecuted under the anti-defection law
 aise main gautam buddha nagar main phir chunaav karwaanaa pad saktaa he
 Obviously these are fictional scenes
 magar isse chunavi prakriya kaa ek bada jhol saamne aayaa he ki namakan bharne ke baad agar koi ummidavaar dal badal le to kya hoga? On Wednesday night, when there were reports that Ramesh Chandra Tomar was leaving Congress and joining BJP, he strongly denied these reports
 khabaren dikhaane vaale channelon ke khilaaf chunaav ayog main shikaayat karne kii dhamkee di
 In the midnight press conference, he said that he will remain in the Congress
 yah bhi kaha ki jo log aisa kah rahe hai ki unke khilaaf vah manahani kaa mukadmaa darj karenge
 Tomar's son denied the news by calling in the media
 guuruuvaar subah jab congress netaaon ne unhen phone kar poocha ki vah kahaan hai, to unhone bataaya ki vah shikaayat karne ke liye chunaav ayog ke daftar main gaye hai
 This was true to some extent, as he was on the Ashoka Road
 fark sirf itnaa tha ki tomars ashok road par chunaav ayog ke daftar ke bajaae iske bagal main hi bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh kii kothi par the, jahaan rajnath singh ne unhen paanch rupee kii parchi dekar bijepi main phir shaamil kar liya
 Whatever political party, BJP or Congress, would get a chance to trounce the other, they definitely do the same
 kuch samay pehle hi congress ne atal bihari vaajapeyi kii bhatiji karunaa shukla ko saath lekar apane manch se unase narendra modi ke vaivaahik jivan ke bare main sawaal uthwaae the
 But the big question is about the leaders whose faith takes a few minutes to change
 modi ko pani pi-pikar kosne vaale sabir ali modi kaa gungan karte hue bijepi main aae or choubees ghanton ke bheetar hi duusare daravaaje se baahar nikal gaye
 Either these leaders are not abstinent from using them as pieces for their own benefit in the political parties' game of degrading each other or they believe that people will not tell them what they want to do
 par kya vaaki aisa he? The Congress has spoken out against the Modi government over the Rafale plane deal
 party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke sawaal uthaane ke baad ab rafel ke sahare modi sarkaar ke khilaaf maahaul banane ke liye congress puri tarah se maidan main utar chuki he
 The Congress has named the Rafale deal as Modi's 'personal deal'
 congress ne patr jari kar kaha he ki modi ji persenalee paris gaye, khud rafel deal kii or persenalee deal badali
 The Congress has released a list of 10 questions on Rafael from PM Modi
 desh bhar main congressi janata ke bich jaakar rafel deal kaa prachaar prasar karenge
 Rahul Gandhi had raised that Congress President Rahul Gandhi had accused Manglawar of being a scam on PM Modi
 rahul ne kaha ki modi ji khud ye samjhauta karne paris gaye the, aakhir desh ko kyon nahin bataaya ja rahaa he ki deal kitne main hui
 Rahul Gandhi said, 'why don't you speak on Rafael Deal? Till date it has been said that the Defense Minister will not tell how much Rafale has been bought
 desh ko nahin bataaenge, modi ji ne ghapala kiya he, mujhe pataa he aap log darate hai
 'ten questions 1 issued by Congress
 kya aisa gopneey he raksha mantri ji ki rafel saude ko chupaaya ja rahaa he ?2
 Is Parliament a threat to the security of the country? What permission was taken from CCS for this deal? 3
 aarope he ki ek plane kii keemat 1555 karod rupee hai, jabaki congress 428 karod main rupee main kharid rahi thi ?4
 The cost of America's most modern war aircraft is not even 1500 crore rupees, so why were these aircraft bought so expensive? 5
 is saude main technology transfar kyon nahin ho rahaa he?6
 Comedy, questioning the defense deal is treason
 aap to aaj bhi boforce par aarope lagaate hai or prashn karte hai?7
 Why did the army hold a press conference on the Rafale deal? Is the Army CAG? 8
 videsh se pradhanmantri ne kyon is raksha saude kii ghoshnaa kii? ajtak aaazaad bharat ke kisi PM ne ye kaam nahi kiya
 9
 is saude se sarkari HAL ko hataa kar ambani ko kyon daalaa ja rahaa he? 25000 karod rupee kaa ghaataa he HAL ko ?10
 Why not hand over the investigation to the Joint Parliamentary Committee ie JPC

 He said that the Intelligence Bureau (IB) did not find anything like this and it is a 'closed chapter'
 sampadakon ke ek samooh ke saath baatcheet ke dauraan singh ne kaha ki unhone is maamle kii jaanch karne ke liye ibi ko nirdesh diye the

 The Prime Minister said, 'he (mukherjee) complained to me
 maine ibi ko gahan jaanch karne ke nirdesh diye the
 The IB reported to me that there is no such thing there
 ’vah is sawaal par pratikriya de rahe the ki kya vitt mantri ne unase yah shikaayat kii thi ki unke daftar main kathith jasusi kii koshish ho rahi he
 Singh insisted, 'this is a closed chapter
 ’is sawaal par ki kya grih mantri ko is sambandh main vishwaas main nahin liya gaya tha, unhone kaha, ‘yah sahi he
 There is a 'need to know' principle in government
 bataur pradhanmantri maine ibi se mujhe is baat se santusht karaane ko kaha ki vahaan is tarah kaa kuch bhi (jasusi) nahin ho rahaa he

 bharat main ye smartphone uplabdh he
 We have reviewed this smartphone and tell you whether this smartphone will be a profitable deal for you at this price or not
 dizin or bild qualityaajkal glass metal dizin vaale smartfones trend main hai
 But Nokia has introduced this smartphone with an all metal body
 pehali najar main ye smartphone bild quality ke lihaaj se solid lagata he
 Talking about the design, there is a square shaped camera module on the rear panel
 isamen teen camere hai or ek elidi flash he
 Just below this is the fingerprint scanner and Nokia's branding
 front main aapako water drop style noch dikhegaa
 This smartphone has thin bezels and Chin has Nokia written on it
 phone ke dayee taraf wolum rocker or home batan diya gaya he, jabaki bain taraf gloing batan he
 The bottom of the smartphone has a speaker grill with USB Type c port and a headphone jack at the top
 phone hold karne main acha lagata he or khaas baat ye he ki ye zyada slipri nahin he
 You can use it even without cover, there is no fear of slipping by hand

 This smartphone looks unique in terms of design and build quality
 phone kaa mat finnish shandaar he or ise hold karne main ye premium lagata he
 Display Nokia 7
 2 main 6
 There is a 3 inch display and it is LCD with a resolution of 2280X1080
 disple colorphul, brit or aakraamak he
 Dark mode feels much better in apps
 vuing angel acha he or outdoor main bhi aap isaki disple ko dekh paaenge or contant pard paaenge
 If you watch movies on Netflix or General HDR content looks even better
 disple itani brit he ki aapako isse koi dikkat nahin hogi
 Performance and software Nokia 7
 2 ek mid level smartphone he or isamen Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 octacor procesar diya gaya he
 This smartphone is quite smooth and on the performance front this smartphone is perfect
 phone lag nahin karata he or gaming ke dauraan bhi iskaa parformens niraash nahin karata he
 However, it is difficult to do multiple heavy apps and high end gaming
 ap switch karnaa kaaphi aasaan or fast he or loding time bhi kam he
 You will clearly see the benefit of having a clean Android in this phone
 is smartphone main blottware na ke baraabar hai
 One thing i have noticed is that if you will do multi-tasking continuously in this smartphone i
e
 open multiple apps one by one then loading takes time
 PUBG or Call Of Duty: Mobile aap khel sakate hai, lekin settings kam karke khelnaa hoga
 Talking about software, Nokia 7
 2 main Stock Android miltaa he or ye Android One he
 It is clean and has Google's apps and features
 haalanki isamen nokia pyor disple customijeshan miltaa he
 Integrated features like Google Assistant, Google Lens and Google are used properly and all work very smooth
 google assistant ko actevet karne ke liye batan kaa yuj kar sakate hai
 i have faced the problem of being slow sometimes with the camera app, which the company should fix
 ek khaas baat ye he ki nokia ne vaada kiya he ki company 2 saal tak software apgrade degi or 3 saal tak manthali security apadats milte rahenge
 This is better in terms of security
 fingerprint kii baat karen to ye fast he or ise swip down karke notification panel ke liye yuj kar sakate hai
 Such features are already given in pixels and Xiaomi smartphones
 facial ricognishan bhi fast he, lekin ye sicyor nahin he, kyonki ye front camera besd he
 Camera Nokia 7
 2 main tripal rier camera seoup diya gaya he
 The primary camera is 48 megapixels and is the main camera
 doosraa cell 8 megapixl kaa he or ye ultra wide he jabaki teesraa camera 5 megapixl kaa he jo depth effect ke liye he
 This smartphone has a 20-megapixel front camera for selfie
 aap is phone se acchhee quality kii photose clic kar sakate hai
 Especially its main camera is affected and its result is excellent
 photose crisp hoti hai or inamen ditels bhi hoti hai
 It is good if the light is good, otherwise the pictures clicked in low light do not affect it
 standard photose kii baat karen to isamen koi dikkat nahin he, lekin wide angel lens se photography shaayad aapako pasand na aae
 There are very few smartphones in the market that give excellent results with ultra wide
 camera interphes kii baat karen to ye simple he
 Portrait mode is quite popular these days and companies try to do it better
 boke effect yaa becoground bler vaali tasviir logon ko zyada pasand aati hai
 Nokia 7
 2 kaa portret mod main clic karke edit kar sakate hai or yahaan apane hisaab se bler ko edjust kar sakate hai
 There are also some fancy effects for adjusting the blur that you can use
 portret mod main clic kii gai image soshal media par aplod karne ke liye thik he, lekin photography point of vyuu se dekhen to ye sahi nahin he
 Sometimes this phone is not able to separate the subject and background from the right and due to this the photos look strange
 digital juum ausat darje kaa he or juum kii gai tasveeron main zyada ditels kii ummid nahin kar sakate hai
 Overall, the photography of this smartphone is better than average in this segment and leaves many smartphones behind
 bydaree linenok 7
 2 has a 3,500mah battery
 powerful bydaree he or aap ise ek din aaraam se chalaa sakate hai
 In mixed use, you use it throughout the day and it saves 30% by evening
 standbai byaap bhi prabhavit karata he
 But the problem is that this smartphone charge is a bit slow
 kya aapako ye smartphone khareednaa chahie?kai chijen hai jo is smartphone ko alag banaati hai
 The first is its look, which makes it different from other smartphones today
 luk or feel acha hone kii vajah se aap isaki taraf aakarshith ho sakate hai
 Another important thing is its software experience and performance
 zyada uljhan nahin hogi, kyonki clin software he
 Think of software upgrades and security patches as a bonus, because users in India still care less about security patches and ultimately its limited, but better photography
 overol is segment main Nokia 7
 2 may prove to be a good package
 lekin kuch downside bhi hai jinke bare main hamane upar bataaya he

 During the construction of electric poles in Kanjhawala area of outer Delhi, there may be an accident in which someone's life is lost, people are surprised to see this
 yahaan kii shiv vihaar karaalaa colony main bijli ke khambhe lagaae ja rahe the
 To erect these poles, the wire of the crane touched the electrical wires coming out of the top
 khambhe ke liye khode gaye gadde main bhi pani bharaa tha

 bataaya ja rahaa he ki iske baavjood bhi yahaan kaam kar rahe mazdooron ko koi sefti tuls nahin die gaye, haalanki is haadase main sthaneey police or bijli company tata power kuch bhi bolne se batch rahi he
 The post-mortem of Kanjhawla Police Station Police is investigating the case
 pathankot hamale kii jaanch main juty pakistan kii esaiti ko aisa koi saboot nahin mila he, jisase sabit ho sake ki hamale ke peeche jaish-e-mohammad kaa haath he
 This claim has been made by Pakistan newspaper The Tribune, quoting sources
 akhbaar ke mutabiq, yah baat bharat ko bataa bhi di gai he
 The evidence that India handed over to Pakistan by considering Maulana Masood Azhar as the mastermind in the Pathankot attack, Pakistan not only declared it inadequate, but nothing has been found against him in the investigation of Pakistan SIT, so that he can be prosecuted
 
 pakistan media ke mutabik, pradhanmantri navaj sharif kii manjuuri ke baad esaiti kii is jaanch report ko pakistan ke enese nasir khan janjua ne bharat ke enese ajit dowaal ke saath saajha bhi kiya he
 However, this has not been officially confirmed yet
 pathankot hamalaa maamle main bharat ne pakistan ko kai saboot saunpe, jisamen paanch phone number or un par hui baatcheet ahm thi
 After this, Nawaz Sharif, assuring India of action, formed a six-member SIAT, which includes officers from Army Intelligence to ISI
 isane pichley hafte hi sarkaar or sainya netritv ko apni report saunpi he
 The comments pakistan ne bharat se or saboot ke saath-saath esaiti ke bharat daure kaa prastaav bhi rakhaa he
 But when Pakistan is crying out for lack of evidence, nothing more is expected to come out
 pathankot hamale ke baad bharat pakistan videsh sachivon ke bich baatcheet tuuti nahin to ataki zarur padi he
 The Ministry of External Affairs is predicting this to happen in the near future, but after official information like a clean chit to Masood Azhar, it may be far-fetched
 pathankot hamale ke maamle main moulana masood ajahar ko mastermaid maanakar bharat ne pakistan ko jo saboot saunpe, pakistan ne na sirf use naakaafi qaraar diya, balki pakistan esaiti kii jaanch main uske khilaaf aisa kuch nahin mila he, jisase us par koi mukadmaa chalaaya ja sake
 According to Pakistan media, after the approval of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, this investigation report of the SIT has also been shared by Pakistan's NSA Nasir Khan Janjua with India's NSA Ajit Doval
 haalanki is baat kii aadhikarik pushti abhi nahin hui he
 In the Pathankot attack case, India handed over many evidences to Pakistan, in which five phone numbers and the conversations on them were important
 iske baad navaj sharif ne bharat ko karrwai kaa bharosa dete hue chah sadasyeey esaiati kaa gathan kar diya, jisamen army intelligence se lekar iesai tak ke adhikari shaamil hai
 It submitted its report to the government and military leadership only last week
 tippaniyan Pakistan has proposed further evidence from India as well as the sit's visit to India
 lekin jab pakistan sabooton kii kami kaa ronaa ro rahaa ho to isse bhi kuch adhik nikal kar saamne aane kii ummid nahin he
 After the Pathankot attack, talks between India and Pakistan foreign secretaries have been stuck, if not broken
 videsh mantralay ise nikat bhavishya main hona tay bataa rahaa he, lekin masood azhar ko clinit jaisi aadhikarik jaankaree ke baad ye dur kii kaudi ho sakati he

 khadge ne kaha- vipaksh main baithne ke liye mila janadeshhusain dalwai ne shivasena ko samarthan dene kii vakaalat keemharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aae nau din ho chuke hai, lekin sarkaar banane par ab tak suspence jari he
 All the questions are going on in the corridors of power and the leaders are making rhetoric, but the picture is not clear about forming the government
 shivasena satta ke dhai-dhai saal bantwaare kii maang par adi he, lekin bijepi maanane ko taiyaar nahin he
 At the same time, Sanjay Raut has met NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, so there is a churn in Congress to support Shiv Sena
 inhen sab ghatnakram ke bich netaaon kii bayaanbaji saamne aa rahi he
 Congress is divided over supporting Shiv Sena
 shivasena ko samarthan dene ke masale par congress ke netaa aamane-saamne aa gaye hai
 However, the Congress high command has not opened its cards yet
 shuukravaar ko maharashtra congress ke netaaon ne sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii thi
 The delegation of Maharashtra Congress leaders included Balasaheb Thorat, Ashok Chauhan, Prithviraj Chauhan and Manikrao Thackeray among others
 is baithak main congress haikaman ne maharashtra ke netaaon se wet and watch kii naseehat di he
 Congress leader Kharge said - In Maharashtra, the veteran Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge has refused to support the Shiv Sena
 saath hi vipaksh main baithne kii baat kahi he
 On the statement of Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, Mallikarjun Kharge said, "I want to make it very clear that we have not discussed any form on forming a government with Shiv Sena
 hamako vipaksh main baithne kaa janadesh mila he
 So we will sit in opposition and try to help every troubled person of the society
 ' congress khadge ne kaha ki maharashtra kii 90 fisadi jansankhya mushkil halaaton se jujh rahi he
 During this, Congress leader Mallikarjun Khargene also attacked the BJP
 unhone kaha ki bijepi satta ke liye kuch bhi kar sakati he
 She does not operate democratically
 bijepi logon par prabhutv jamaane ke liye dhamkaana chaahati he
 The ideology of BJP and Shiv Sena has scared people
 unako un logon ko sangrakshan dena chahie, jo unki vichaardhaara kaa samarthan karte hai
 BJP and Shiv Sena will definitely meet again and start further discussion
 shivasena ko samarthan dene ke paksh main hossain dalvaivahin, congress ke kuch netaa shivasena ko samarthan dene ke paksh main hai
 Congress leader Hussain Dalwai argued that there is a ground-sky difference between BJP and Shiv Sena
 donon ke hindutv main antar he
 BJP talks of one country, one party and one religion, whereas Shiv Sena never talks like this
 shivasena ne chunaav main musalamaanon ko tikat bhi diya, lekin bijepi ne kisi musalmaan ko tikat nahin diya
 Arguing to support the Shiv Sena, Congress leader Hussain Dalwai said that anything is possible in politics
 maharashtra ke sabhi udyog gujarat ja rahe hai
 So now Congress and NCP will do something together
 unhone kaha ki shivasena ko samarthan dena chahie, kyonki bijepi maharashtra ko khatm kar rahi he
 He said that i do not think that voters consider Congress as anti-hindutva party
 congress netaa ne kaha ki is maharashtra ko dharmanirpeksh maharashtra hi bane rahanaa chahie
 Shiv Sena should be supported
 unhone kaha ki shivaji maharaj ne bhi aisa hi kiya tha
 What will happen in Maharashtra now? In Maharashtra, the picture is not clear yet whose government will be formed
 agar bijepi or shivasena milakar sarkaar nahin banaate hai, to kya hoga
 If NCP and Congress also do not support Shiv Sena, it will be difficult to form government
 maharashtra chunaav main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ko to bahumat mila he, lekin koi bhi party 146 siton ke jaadui aankade ko nahin chhu pai he

 ' anandiben ne apane fasebuk par istipha dekar sabhi ko chaunkaa diya he
 The BJP also did not get time to prepare that it would consider the name of a new Chief Minister before resigning
 to dekhte hai ki aage kii puri prakriya kya hogi? The BJP Parliamentary Board has a meeting on Tuesday
 isamen anandiben ke istife kii peshkash par vichaar hoga
 There is every possibility that the resignation will be accepted
 lekin party main kuch log aise bhi hai jo ye kayaas laga rahe hai ki shaayad modi istipha naamanzoor kar sakate hai
 The comments haalanki koi bhi party ek anicchhuk mukhyamantri rajya main nahin chaahegi
 So when the resignation is approved, the party will decide the procedure for the election of the new Chief Minister
 isamen ek yaa do kendriya paryvekshak niyukt kiye jaaenge jo gujarat aaenge, party ke logon se or vidhayakon se milenge
 They will meet and try to know who should be the new Chief Minister
 is prakriya main yah bhi lagbhag tay mana ja rahaa he ki zyaadaatar vidhayak amit shah kaa naam lenge
 Then a name will be decided by talking to the central leadership
 uske baad bhaajapa vidhayak dal kii ek baithak bulaai jaaegi
 Most likely the new name will be proposed by Anandiben Patel herself and other big leaders will support her
 ye to rahi prakriya kii baat lekin naam to vahi hoga jo narendra modi chahenge
 After all, Gujarat is their home state and the high command here is Modi only
 mangalvaar ko bhaajapa sansadeey board kii baithak he
 It will consider Anandiben's resignation offer
 puri sambhaavna he ki istipha manjuur kar liya jaayegaa
 But there are some people in the party who are thinking that maybe Modi can reject the resignation
 tippaniyan However, no party would want a reluctant Chief Minister in the state
 to jab istipha manjuur ho jaayegaa to party naye mukhyamantri ke chunaav kii prakriya tay karegi
 In this, one or two central observers will be appointed who will come to Gujarat, meet party people and mlas
 unase milakar jaanane kii koshish karenge ki nayaa mukhyamantri koun hona chahie
 In this process, it is also believed that most of the mlas will take the name of Amit Shah
 phir kendriya netritv se baatcheet karke ek naam tay kiya jayega
 After that a meeting of BJP Legislature Party will be called
 zyaadaatar sambhaavna yahi he ki nae naam kaa prastaav khud anandiben patel karengi or anya bade netaa uskaa samarthan karenge
 This is a matter of process but the name will be what Narendra Modi would like
 aakhir gujarat unka apana grih rajya he or yahaan ke haikamand sirf or sirf modi hi hai
 However, no party would want a reluctant Chief Minister in the state

 The Ganges is called the Mokshadayini River, but the picture of a changing India changed the rivers as well
 vikaas kii patari par daudte shaharon ne in nadiyon kii saanse hi roak di he, lekin ab modi sarkaar or dilli sarkaar donon ne hi ganga or yamuna ko saaf karne kaa lakshya banaaya he
 New technologies will be used for this
 ganga ko ab jaivik takanic se saaf kiya jayega
 What will be the Ganga and Yamuna? Many plans have been brought before this to make Ganga and Yamuna unfreeze
 sawaal ye he ki kya ganga or yamuna saaf hogi?ganga or yamuna kaa panibahut mailaa ho chukaa he
 The Ganges is not just a river
 vah aasthaa or sanskaron kii aatma bhi he
 Thousands of crores of rupees have been spent in the name of cleaning the Ganga, but the Ganga could not be cleaned
 jahaan modi sarkaar 'namaami ganga pariyojna' ke tahat ek baar phir ganga ko pradooshan mukt karne kii shuruyaat kar chuki he, to vahiin yamuna ke liye dilli sarkaar bhi kai yojanaon par kaam kar rahi he
 However, it has not yielded any significant results
 saat bade rajyon se hokar guzarati he gangadarasal, ganga kii lambaai kareeb 2510 kilometre he or ye desh ke saat bade rajyon se hokar guzarati he
 As the ganges-bade passes through the big cities
 vaise-vaise shahar ko kachra or ganda pani sidhe iske pani main miltaa he
 There are 140 big rivulets in the 2510-kilometer Ganges, whose dirty water falls directly into the Ganges
 yahi haal yamuna kaa bhi he
 Yamuna turns into black water as soon as it enters Delhi
 naala he yaa nadi pataa hi nahin chalata
 Will yamunamuna be cleaned with organic technology? Delhi government had a meeting on cleaning of Yamuna using Japanese technology, in which a company named US ENVIRON gave a presentation
 meeting main dilli ke dipti siem manish sisodiya ke alaava dilli ke jal mantri kapil mishra bhi maujuud the
 The company's managing director (MD) US Sharma also showed him the pilot project of cleaning the Bakarganj drain falling in the Ganges river in Patna with this technology
 yah kaam kendriya pradooshan niyantran board or rashtriya ganga nadi basin praadhikaran kii manjuuri se ho rahaa he
 The company claims that 140 drains falling in the Ganga will be cleaned in two to three years
 dilli ke siem ne unhen technical study ke baad kaam saunpane kaa bharosa diya he
 What is the biological technique? In this technique, water is cleaned with volcanic ash
 uske baad ise block main milakar iko baio block taiyaar kar diya jaataa he
 Echo Bio Blocksey interceptors are made, which are placed over a certain distance in the drains
 naale kaa ganda pani usase takaraata he or pani saaf hone lagata he
 Also, the chemicals in Eco Bio Block contain 20 types of bacteria, which become active as soon as they come in contact with water
 ise aerobics takanic kaha jaataa he
 Polluted water is the food of these bacteria
 ye jeevanu 10 se 70 degree celsius taapmaana main pani saaf karte hai
 Water will continue to be cleaned for ten years, once a block is built, for ten years, the dirt in the drain will be cleaned
 das saal baad is prakriya ko doharaana tabhi padegaa jab waapas usee haal main naale ho jaaenge
 If the dirt stops going into the Ganges and Yamuna and a certain amount of water stays in the Yamuna at all times, then the natural dirt will disappear with the flow of water
 japan samet kai deshon main iske safal prayog ho chuke hai
 The us-based company claims that it has the ability to clean drains falling in both major rivers of the country simultaneously

 But he did not know that the painting that is being made before him, he will hang in the street like this
 phir bhi sugandha court aati he
 Listening to taunts all the time
 vah jaj se kahati he
 He is a true artist
 isliye maine iske liye kapade utaare
 Saying this she leaves
 or uske baad raja daleelon ke ghode par savaar ho parakram dikhaata he
 He says that i freed God from his aristocratic enclosure
 use logon tak pahunchaaya
 Humanized him vah kahata he ki jin auraton ko maine kuchi se ukera, ve sab purushon se chali gai hai
 Shakuntala, Sita, Ahilya
 maine unhen mukt kiya he
 Through his free art
 baharhaal, faisla raja ke paksh main hota he
 He leaves the court room with some satisfaction, some pride, and some darp
 use lagata he ki brahmanvaadi paakhand ko usne chalni kar diya
 He arrives at Sugandha's house with a donor gesture
 magar vahaan bheed lagi he
 Inside the room, his art hangs dead

 Removes the clothes of the man inside him

 In adopting it, however
 ye kamjor bauddhik tark ki tum meri kalpana se baahar kahin nahin ho
 And right here Rang Rangiya becomes a strong film
 ye kisi ko mahaan banane kii taraf bhaagti nahin
 But yes, it reflects all the shallow ravines of its time
 rang rasiyaa kahani he 19veen sadi ke mahaan,krantikari painter raja ravi vermaki
 Ravi Verma, who hails from Kerala, was given the title of Raja by the king of the place influenced by his art
 raja mare to sangrakshan chuta or phir vah mumbai aa gaye
 Here he got the patronage of the princely state of Gaikwad
 raja ne kaha, europe kii style main kuch banaao
 Ravi said, there are many stories in our country
 inhen hi paint karata hum
 And for this i will first roam the country
 desh ghoomane ke dauraan ek subah banaras ke ghat par ravi ko apni tamaam puranic chhaviyaan najar ain
 In which he himself was in male form and his beloved or, say, Prerna Sugandha in feminine form
 waapas aa ravi ne painting banaai
 The king urged that the art be opened to the public
 yahaan jab ek aamajan ne ramayana kaa prasang dekha, to vah vahiin natmastak ho bhajan gane laga
 That day Ravi felt that God needed to be freed from the pandits
 phir unhone sab kuch daanv par laga printig press chalaai
 Art went on, reached home
 raja kii khyaati badi or museebataan bhi
 Talk about the merits of Rangarasiya film first
 yah film ranjit desai ke upanyasraja ravi vermaper aadhaarit he
 The story and message of the film are inspiring
 isamen kala kaa samaajwaad najar aata he
 Ravi Varma's insistence on reaching the Gods to the people or creating a woman for the painting of Goddess Saraswati and Lakshmi, which people do not use for devotion
 film main anil mehta kii cinemetography bahut umdaa he
 Lovers converging on the side of the cliff or playing in the painting room covered in colors
 sab kuch bahut shubh sundar dikhataa he
 Apart from this, the acting of Havaratneep Hoodika is also good
 ek kalakaar ke kaam main jo ‘kaam’, samarpan, jid or jujharupan hona chahie
 All of that is visible in his face and body language
 unke ulatnandana senako acting nahin ai
 She is the weak link of the film
 rang rasiyaa kii ek khaasiyat iskaa najariya bhi he
 It shows the untouchables, women and revolutionaries in the morning light
 yah kala ke prati dharm kii aad main ashishnu hote samaaj ko bhi sheesha dikhaati he
 The choice of Rang Rasiya's supporting cast is more or less good
 jaj ke role main tom alter, chintamani pandit ke role main darshan jarivaala, vakil ke role main vikram gokhale, chote bhai raaj bane gaurav or bindaas bombai girl franni baniin freyna vajahir
 There are many songs in the film
 ye na to kaaljayi hai or na hi besure
 It would have been better if most of the film had finished ringing
 kahani main inaki gunjaaish jabaran na paidaa kerani padati
 The screenplay of the film could have been better
 ye dolata sa he
 Flashback and then flashback in it is fine
 magar kai kirdaaron kii kahaniyaan adhuri rah jaati hai
 They leave the landscape
 phir achaanak chale aate hai or bich ke darmiyaan un par kya gujri, ye nahin bataaya jaataa
 And it's not just about the characters on the side

 ek janvari ko jab sari duniya 2018 kaa swaagat kar rahi thi, tab assam main kai sthanon par subah se hi ghumaavdaar kataren lagi huin thim
 Distraught people were waiting to find their names in the first draft of the National Register of Citizenship (NRC), which was released by the state government at exactly midnight
 desh main kahin bhi enarasi ke prakashit hone kii yah duusari ghatana thi—pehali baar ise 1951 main prakashit kiya gaya tha
 Even though political parties and social workers have started congratulating the people of Assam — 19 million people have got their names in NRC, while verification is going on for 1
39 million people — but updating NRC The credit for turning KK into a reality goes to Pradeep Gogoi, 85, and Abhijeet Sarma, 43
 assam se avaidh ghuspaithiyon ko baahar nikaalane ke makasad se centre sarkaar, assam sarkaar or assam andolan ke netaaon kii ore se hastakshrit 1985 ke assam samjhaute kii mahatvapurn dhaaraon main se ek 1951 ke enarasi ko adhyatan karnaa bhi tha taaki rajya ke paas vaid nagarikon kaa ek vaastavik vivaran ho
 But this condition remained on paper
 2005 main ek or tripaksheeya samjhaute par centre sarkaar, assam sarkaar or ol assam students union ke netaaon ne hastakshar kiye
 Under the new agreement, in 2010, the state government started NRC pilot projects in two districts
 lekin chunki ek alpsankhyak chaatr samooh ke sadasyon ne hinsa kaa sahaara lekar is prakriya ko avaruddh kar diya tha, is kaaran is pariyojna ko nirast kar diya gaya
 In January 2009, Gogoi, an iit-kharagpur alumnus, approached entrepreneur-turned-social activist Sarma to file a PIL in the Supreme Court seeking removal of 41 lakh 'illegal voters' from the electoral rolls
 20 july, 2008 ko sarvocch nyaayalay main maamla darj kiya gaya
 But the petitioners appealed to the court to monitor the process of updating the NRC itself, which was a necessary condition for cleaning the voter list
 2 april, 2013 ko yah maamla nyaayamurti ranjan gogoi or ech
 L
 gokhale kii khandpeeth ke paas pahunchaa
 The work commenced in May 2015 and the Court fixed December 31, 2017 as the date of publication of the first draft of NRC
 media se dur rahane vaale gogoi kehete hai, ''is tarah ke kaam ke liye samarpan, eemaandaaree or saahas kii jarurat hoti he
 So i contacted Sarma
 '' pehali yachika kaa masauda unhone hi likhaa tha or kanoonee ladaai ke liye apane paise lagaae
 His non-governmental organization Assam Public Wax (APW), founded on behalf of 36 businessmen in 2000, became the face of this campaign
 sarama is baar main bataate hai, ''apidblyoo kii pehali ladaai ulpha ke khilaaf thi
 After 2008, we raised the issue of illegal infiltrators
 ''par sarama kii ladaai abhi khatm nahin hui he
 The current update of the NRC is based on the Assam Accord, which accepted 1971 as a cut-off year to declare anyone an illegal intruder
 disambar 2012 main assam sammilit mahasang ke adhyaksh matiur rahamaan ne sarvocch nyaayalay main ek rit yachika ke jariye cat of varsh ko 1950 karne kii maang kii
 This demand is also supported by RSS and Assam Finance Minister Hemant Biswa Sarma
 yadi adaalat ne rahamaan kii yachika ke paksh main faisla kiya, to enarasi ko adhyatan karne kii prakriya amaanya ho jaaegi
 Refusing to accept the rise in the price of onion as an issue of increasing the burden of inflation on the common man, Pasha Patel, the national vice president of bjp's Kisan Morcha, created a new controversy by saying that if a person does not eat onions for a month, He will not die
 patel ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan ke dauraan kaha, ‘pyaaj kii mulya vruddhi koi mudda nahin he
 But the public is being misled by making it an issue
 main isaki ninda karata hum
 'he said,' No one will die by not eating onions for a month
 lekin anaaj nahin khaane se koi vyakti jarur mar jaayegaa
 Patel defined the onion according to himself, saying, 'onion is not a stuffing stomach
 yah jeebh kaa swaad badalane kii cheez he
 "A senior BJP leader hailing from Maharashtra said," It is said that it is a good thing not to eat onions
 agar koi acha aadmi zyada pyaaj khaataa he, to vah gadabad karata he
 This (onion) is not a good thing and it is not right to create so much chaos on what is not good
 ’patel yaheen nahin ruke
 He claimed, 'according to Hindu theology in our Maharashtra it is said that onions should not be eaten in the holy Shravan month
 ’ varisht bijepi netaa ne lage haath yah daawa bhi kiya ki pyaaj kii keemten kisaanon ne nahin, balki ‘bhagwaan’ ne badhaayi hai
 Patel said, 'the country's major onion producer Maharashtra faced a famine due to no rain
 logon ke paas pine tak ko pani nahin tha, to ve kheton main pyaaj kii fasal kaise sinchate
 'patel said,' Such situation has come in the last five-ten years, when the price of onion has increased from five rupees to 50 rupees
 lekin isse koi bhuuchaal nahin aa gaya he
 Everybody is saying that due to increase in prices of onions, the entire community is going to waste and people are going to die
 aisi koi baat nahin he
 When bjp's National Vice President of Kisan Morcha was told that his own party was seen selling cheap onions to gain political advantage ahead of the upcoming assembly elections in Delhi, he said, "I am talking politics on the rise in onion prices i am not doing main kisaan hum
 i just want to say that do not create so much ruckus on this issue
 ’is bich, congress ne maukey kaa phayda uthaate hue patel ke vivaadaaspad bayaan ko lekar bijepi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Madhya Pradesh Congress spokesperson Narendra Saluja said, 'the Congress government at the Center is trying to rein in onion prices
 lekin patel kaa bayaan bijepi kii asaliyat ujagar karte hue sabit karata he ki desh ke pramukh vipakshi dal ko aam aadmi kii takalifon se hakeekat main koi sarokaar nahin he or vah pyaaj kii keemten badhane par mahaj raajnneetik nautanki kar rahaa he
 ' kamyaabi ke jashn to duniya main bahut manaae gaye magar kisi ne shaayad aisa jashn nahin manaaya hoga, jaisaa uttar korea ke supreme leader marshall kim jong un ne manaaya
 That too in front of the volcano at an altitude of 9 thousand feet
 shaayad kim jong un duniya ko yaa khaskar america ko bataane kii koshish kar rahaa he ki jitani jwaala is jwalamukhi main he utani hi isaki mixilon or parmaanu bamon main bhi he
 And if you have time, it will also use it

 This is the destruction of nature
 ab kim jong un kii tabaahi dekhie
 Nuclear bomb

 Chemical bomb

 Cannon ball

 Overall, both of these catastrophes are dangerous for human civilization
 magar kya aap jaanate hai in donon tabaahiyon kaa aapas main conection he
 In the border with China, this area of north Korea is the area of mount Pektu
 korian peninsula kii ye sabase oonchi pahari har sau-do sau saalon main jwalamukhi banakar tabaahi machaati he
 But this time, by climbing this 2 thousand 744 meters high hill, North Korean dictator Jong has made a celebration of human destruction
 kim jong un uttar korea ke sabase oonche pahaad par ja chadha
 Kim celebrates success by reaching the top of the mountain
 kim jong un kaa ye jashn satta ke shikhar par pahunchane kaa nahin balki america tak pahunchane vaali missile ke safal pareekshan kaa he
 Climbing the country's highest position, Kim Jong-un tried to tell the world that he now has access to any part of the world
 or apni aadat se ulat kim jong un ne apni is khushi kaa baqayada vedia banaakar izhaar kiya he
 See Kim Jong Un Yeh celebrating this hill with his army in front of the statue of his grandfather Kim Il Sung about three thousand meters high
 kim ne sabase pehle apane dada ko shradhanjali di or phir sena ne uski shaan main parade kii
 And on the other hand, when the person was seen walking like a Emperor alone, the army started cheering
 is jashn ke baad sena ne apane supreme leader marshall kim jong un ko salaami di
 Then as the band of the army played patriotic tunes
 ye puraa kaa puraa pahari ilaaka gunj uthaa
 In the presence of its Supreme Leader, the enthusiasm of the army was being seen
 is dauraan puure vakt kim kaa chehre alag hi chamak rahaa tha
 Perhaps this laughter was to make our country more strong
 north korea kii nai intercontinental belistic missile hwasong-15 ke safal pareekshan ke baad se ye jashn desh main lagaataar chal rahaa he
 But this is the first time such a celebration is being celebrated at an altitude of about three thousand meters in the presence of Supreme Leader Marshall Kim Jong Un
 is maukey par pahaad kii chotii par pahunchakar mixilon ke kaamyaab test se gadgad kim jong un itaraahat vaali hansi hansaa
 As if he is saying that America is no longer out of his JD
 iske baad kim jong un ne bhaashan dekar apni sena kaa haunsala badhaayaa
 Many army officers became emotional after listening to the speech of their senior leader
 or aakhir main kim jong un ne yaheen khai america kii tabaahi kii kasam
 The Kim dynasty of North Korea and Mount Pektu have a very old relationship
 uttar korea main ise sabase pavitra jagah mana jaataa he
 Whenever a ruler of North Korea demonstrates his strength, he also comes to this hilltop to thank him
 aisa nahin he ki kim jong un ne pehali baar mount pektu kaa daura kiya ho
 He has been here before
 lekin mount pektu par kim jong un ke is daure ko uske pichley missile test kii kamyaabi se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he

 Wearing such new style burqas will attract the attention of rapists

 com / lkprwdtzxz — COLORS (@colorstv) October 4, 2018 On the other hand, Surabhi's Saba and Somikhan are not making any sense at all
 promo main dikhaaya gaya he ki surabhi kii sabaa or somi kii itani tikhi takaraar hui kii baat gaali-galouj tak chali gai
 Surabhi threatened to slap both of them
 neha pendse bhi surabhi ke khilaaf ho gayi
 In fact, Surabhi Rana has made a point of swearing Somi's mother falsely
 donon kaa jhagada itnaa bad gaya he ki surabhi ne somi ko thappad maarane kii dhamkee de daali he
 Colors has released a new promo of the show, in which the two are seen fighting
 somi-surabhi ke jhagade mensaba khanbhi kud padi hai
 Surbhi says that now she will not leave the two sisters
 rodies fame surabhi jabasebig bosahouse main ai hai ve har kisi se ladane kaa bahaanaa dhund rahi thim
 Now finally they get the issue, which they are taking full advantage of
 har rishta pyaar se shuru hota he lekin us rishte ko usee rup main banaae rakhane ke liye jaruri he ki donon ore se prayaas hote rahen
 Whatever the relationship may be, but if it is not saved, it does not take long to disintegrate the best relationship
 jab do log milte hai todonon ke bich main bahut kam baaten hi ek jaisi hoti hai
 There is a disagreement on many things between the two and sometimes they get angry at each other's behavior, but these habits change by themselves
 ye baat donon pakshon par lagu hoti hai
 On the one hand, while boys dislike some values of girls, some things are also out of tolerance for girls
 ho saktaa he ki aapaki garlfriend ko bhi aapmen kuch baaten pasand na ho lekin wo aapako bataa na paati ho
 In such a situation, if you also have these habits, then start paying attention to them from today: 1
 zyaadaatar ladakiyon ko ye shikaayat hoti he ki unke bwoyfriend unki baat par dhyaan nahin dete hai
 He complains that the boys expect full attention from him when he speaks, but when they say something, they do not pay attention
 2
 Most girls keep on complaining that their partner does not pay attention to them and is mostly busy
 unhen shikaayat hoti he ki wo har samay apane kaam main hi duba rahata he or unka kaam hi unke liye sabase jaruri he
 3
 agar aap bhi un purushon main se hai jo ghar se jude saare faisle akele lete hai, to aapako bataa den ki ladkiyaan aise ladakonko kabhi pasand nahin karti hai
 Girls feel that their partner underestimates them and considers themselves to be the best
 4
 Most men fall asleep soon after intimate relationships
 ladakiyon ko ladakon kii ye aadat bahut buree lagati he
 He expects his partner to talk lovingly with him for some time
 5
 Almost every girl has this problem
 use lagata he ki uskaa bwoyfriend uski tarif nahin karata he or na hi use mahatv detaa he
 Every girl hopes that her partner appreciates and values her in front of everyone

 isi ke saath is film kii auskar puraskaar kii daud main sthiti or majboot ho gai he
 The controversy over the film, based on the story of a boy from a slum becoming a millionaire through a TV show, seems to have come to a halt
 yadhyapi is film kii america main khub vaahvahee ho rahi he, lekin bharat main jhuggi basti main rahane vaale logon ke rahan-sahan ko galtadhang se pesh karne ko lekar kaaphi virodh bhi hua he
 The protest received further air when a British newspaper reported that the film's child actors did not receive proper remuneration
 haalanki beyal or film nirmaataa chrishchiyan kaalson ne iskaa khandan kiya, lekin kal jab boyal ko yah sammaan mila to aisa laga ki vivaadon ko unhone peeche chhod diya he
 Receiving the award, he said that his dream has come true
 unhone duusare film nirmaataaon ko chunauti ke lahaze main kaha ki aap jo sochate hai, usapar kaam bhi kiijie
 Actually after the award, the film's claim for Oscar becomes very strong
 'slamdog milinare' pehle hi sarvshereshth drama kii shrenee main golden globe award paa chuki he
 Producers Guild of America has given the title of best film of this year

 Kim Jong-un, who kept his family life a secret from the world, had been worrying for years
 magar khabar he ki ab uski ye chintaa dur ho gai he
 Because now Kim Jong Un has got his heir
 duniya main uttar korea ko lekar kai rahasy bane hue hai or unheen rahasyon main se ek he yahaan ke supreme leader marshall kim jong-un ke parivaar kaa rahasy
 The world knows that Kikim Jong was married to Unri Saul Joo in 2009 before sitting on the throne of North Korea
 magar bahut kam log hi jaanate hai ki kim kii ri sol ju se kitni aulaaden hai
 Kim Jong-un's wife Ri-sol-joo has given birth to her third child, according to a South Korean intelligence agency report
 magar uski ye teesri bacchee he yaa baccha is par ab tak rahasy bana hua tha
 But now the biggest secret related to North Korea's Marshal Kim has been revealed
 khabar he ki kim jong un ko uskaa vaaris mil gaya he
 It is being told that in the month of February this year, Kim's wife Ri Sol Joo has given birth to a baby boy
 jab jab kim jong un kii patni garbhvatee hoti he tab tab wo saarvajanik rup se dikhnaa band ho jaati hai
 And even this time, when Ri Saal Joo stopped attending public events in 2016, there were speculations that she was pregnant
 lekin sawaal ye he ki aakhir kim parivaar ko lekar itnaa rahasy kyon bana rahata he?kim parivaar ko lekar ye rahasy koi nayaa nahin he
 Regarding the birth of Kim Jong Un himself, it is still a mystery whether he was born in 1983 or 1984
 iske alaava kim jong-un kahaan or kaise paley-bade, is bare main bhi zyaada jaankaree nahin he
 Kim Jong Un himself first appeared in public in September 2010, shortly after his father's death
 uttar korea kii sarkari media hameshaa se apane netaa kii nijee jindagi ke bare main zyaada jaankariyaan nahin detaa
 That is why the news about Kim Jong Un's heirs was also hidden
 aapako bataa den ki kim jong un ke is vaaris se pehle use do betiyaan hai
 One was born in 2010 and the other in 2013
 magar abhi tak inamen se kisi bhi tasviir duniya ke saamne nahin ai he
 The world does not even know his name
 haalanki kim kii badi beti ke bare main videshi media main ye khabar he ki uskaa naam kim jong ei he
 This information was also revealed when American cricket basketball star Dennis Rodman accidentally gave this information in an interview to Guardian in 2013
 denis rodman or kim jong-un kii dosti ajeeb zarur lagati he
 But due to this friendship, the world knows about Kim Jong Un very little
 denis ne hi uttar korea ke is supreme leader ko 'acha pita' bataaya tha or kaha tha ki uskaa 'parivaar bahut sundar he
 'the mystery that remains of Kim's family today was also with her father
 wo bhi apane parivaar kii jaankariyon ko rahasy banaakar rakhte the
 In this family, only Kim Jong-un's grandfather Kim Il-sung was the one who often came out with his wife and his children were seen in the pictures

 Accusing the Congress of running away from discussion in Parliament on the issue of demonetisation, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi today said that the opposition party lacked arguments and facts and was constantly 'no ball' by getting stuck in its chauvinism

 In response to a question about some opposition parties including Congress demanding an apology from the Prime Minister, the Union Minister said, "why should the Prime Minister apologize?" Should they apologize because Dhankuber of black money has become a pauper? Should the Prime Minister apologize because this campaign against black money is going to benefit the poor and common people
 unhone kaha ki congress pradhanmantri se maafee maangane kii maang kar rahi he
 We asked him why the Prime Minister should apologize? Because unscrupulous people are being divided? Or because the blockade and loot lobby of the scam guru gurls have been locked? The Congress and some of its allies are well aware of the fact that whatever the Prime Minister Modi is doing, the biggest benefit will be for the poor, middle class and weaker sections which had been neglected till now

 ) adhyodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar sant or mahant ne sarkaar par dabaav banane ke liye shanivaar ko sammelan kiya
 But instead of bashing the government for the Ram temple, they seem to be mixing notes
 vahiin, shivasena bhi ab ramamandir ke mudde par modi ke peeche chalane ko taiyaar ho rahi he
 Due to these questions, Aaj Tak spoke to Ram Vilas Vedanti
 ram mandir ke liye hameshaa ultimatum kaa jhanda buland karne vaale ramvilas vedanti, jo ramamandir nyaas ke sadsy bhi hai, unhone ajtak se kaha ki ramamandir ke nirmaan se pehle dhara 370 or 35A hamaare agenda main he
 He further said that after its removal the Ram temple will be built and construction will start before 2024
 chitrakoot ke bade sant acharya rambhadracharya ne kaha ki unhen pakki khabar he ki agle 1 saal main ram mandir kaa nirmaan shuru ho jayega
 In addition to the Shiv Sena, in addition to Suris, Shiv Sena's senior leader and MP Sanjay Raut said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak in Ayodhya that "ram Mandir issue will be over in the election of 2024 and only Modi and Yogi will build the temple and Shiv Sena will be in their convoy
 
 "vishwa hindu parishad ke sant sammelan main aae acharya dharmendra ne jab 5 karod muslim chaatro ke wajife or muslim ladakiyon kii shaadi ke liye modi sarkaar kii yojana par pradhanmantri modi ko kosna shuru kiya to sant sammelan main manch par baithe sant or mahant asahaj hone lage kuch ne tokaa
 Some were saying that the Sant Samaj is not ready to listen to the criticism of Narendra Modi
 jaise hi acharya dharmendra ne apana bhaashan khatm kiya duusare santon ne modi sarkaar or pradhanmantri modi kii tarif ke pul baandhne shuru kar die jisase asahaj hokar acharya dharmendra manch se chale gaye
 Actually the time has changed
 modi sarkaar pichhali baar se zyada bahumat main he or modi sarkaar ke liye prachand or bahubali shabdon kaa istemaal ho rahaa he, is jeet ne mandir andolan ke myne badal die hai
 The Modi government, despite having a majority in its last term, had to hear criticism from every platform for the Ram temple
 sant samudaay kaa aisa koi manch nahin tha jisase modi sarkaar ko chetavanee or dhamkee nahin mili ho
 But after assuming the post of Prime Minister for the second time, the tone of all those people who have constantly threatened and cursed the Modi and Yogi government on the temple issue
 lekin wo ab na sirf sarkaar kii sun rahe hai balki adaalat ke faisle tak intjaar karne ko bhi taiyaar hai
 If these saints and mahants are to be believed then the Modi government should be given time till the decision of the court because it is possible if Modi is there, and if Modi is there then a temple will also be built, this general opinion has almost become among the common saints
 badal chukaa he vaktshivsena pramukh uddhav thakare pichley 6 maheene main do baar ayodhya aa chuke hai or donon baar ke tevar bilkul alag-alag hai
 When Uddhav Thackeray came last time in November, he went to the temple giving an ultimatum to the Modi government
 is baar jab aae to isi mandir mudde par saath chalane kaa vaada karke gaye hai
 It is clear that time has changed
 mandir se jude chaahe sadhu-sant hon yaa shivasena jaisi siyaasi party sabhi is baat ko samaj chuke hai ki is baar janata ne mandir ke naam par vot nahin diya, naa hi modi sarkaar ne mandir ke mudde ko aage rakhkar vot maanga
 In such a situation now that PM Modi is in the government with a tremendous victory, then it has become a compulsion for these saints and saints to follow Modi's line because they know that neither the threat and the ultimatum will affect the government
 Nor on the public
 shanivaar ko ayodhya main sant sammelan ke manch se uttar pradesh ke upmukhyamantri keshav maury ne bhi santo ke saamne lagbhag yah saaf kar diya ki sarkaar philhal adaalat ke faisle or madhyasthata kii koshish, donon ko aashaa bhari najaron se dekh rahi he
 If both of these options fail, then only an alternative to law or ordinance will emerge
 yani ab saaf he abhi mandir par kuch intjaar karnaa padegaa or iske liye chaahe sant samaaj ho yaa phir shivasena donon khushi-khushi raji dikhaai de rahe hai

 After the badminton women's doubles players from China, South Korea and Indonesia became involved in match-fixing, India questioned the organizing committee on Wednesday in reference to the Japan and Chinese Taipei players not playing group matches in the spirit of the game
 The protest was lodged but it was rejected
 bhartiya badminton sangh (bai) ke adhyaksh akhilesh das gupta ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki sabooton kii kami ke kaaran is adhikarik virodh ko khaarij kar diya
 Das Gupta said, "on behalf of Bai, we had lodged a protest saying that the match between Japan and Chinese Taipei was also fixed in which Japan deliberately lost the match so that it could get a better draw in the next round
" isi kaaran bharat ko agle round main kwalifai karne kaa mauka nahin mila
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘lekin ab, unhone hamaara virodh khaarij kar diya he
 We are also surprised by this
 ek din pehle hamane chini taipai ko haraaya or ve kwalifai kar gayi hai or hamen isaliye kwalifai nahin kiya gaya kyonki japani team jaanboojhkar haar gayi
 "das Gupta said," He says that he could not find evidence to convict the players

 Indian badminton coach Pullela Gopichand said, "we have officially filed a complaint and asked the Organizing Committee to watch the matches in Japan and Chinese Taipei to see if these matches were played under the spirit of the game
" mujhe lagata he ki ye khel bhaavana main nahin khele gayi the
 '' beeti raat jwaala or ashvini ponppa mahaj ek ank se quarterfinal main pravesh karne se chook gayi, haalanki unhone singapore kii shinta mulia sari or lei yaao ko group bi ke antim match main 21-16, 21-15 se haraa diya tha

 Gopichand said, "the match we are talking about is the women's doubles
 yah baat saaf he ki donon timen haarana chaahati thim
 It is expected that some action will be taken in this regard
 pranali ko badalane kii jarurat he kyonki agar khilaadiyon ke paas vikalp hon to yah kahana uchit hoga ki chini team quarterfinal main nahin bhidana chaahati thi
 Neither Indonesia or Korean team would like to play China in the quarter-finals
 ’’ Gopichand said, "that's why players are trying to use this system to win medals
" ve kya soch rahe hai, yah sahi bhi he
 But we have to make sure that the system remains foolproof and the players are not deliberately allowed to lose
 ’’ Gopichand also said, "there was also a suggestion that all the matches should be played together so that the players would have no chance to calculate the figures and tamper with the result and everyone played to win
" ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘agar aap china kaa ricard dekho to, unhone aisa kai baar kiya he
 They have been doing this for many years

 "we are badly affected by this, but we are hoping that some action will be taken," he said
 ’’ Badminton Association of India (BAI) President Akhilesh Das Gupta said on Wednesday that the official protest was rejected due to lack of evidence

 That is why India did not get a chance to qualify in the next round
 ’’ He said, "but now, they have rejected our opposition
 ham bhi isse hairaan hai
 The day before we defeated Chinese Taipei and they have qualified and we were not qualified because the Japanese team intentionally lost
 ’’ das gupta ne kaha, ‘‘ve kehete hai ki khilaadiyon ko aaropee tehraane ke liye ve saboot nahin dhund paye
 On this basis, he dismissed our appeal
 ’’ Indian players Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa were eliminated despite winning two matches in the women's doubles after which India lodged an official protest with the organizers of the Games
 bhartiya badminton coach pulela gopichand ne kaha, ‘‘hamane aadhikarik rup se shikaayat darj kii he or aayojan samiti se japan or chini taipe ke maichon ko dekhne ko kaha he ki ye match khel bhaavana ke antargat khele gayi the yaa nahin
 i think these games were not played in the spirit
 ’’ Last night Jwala and Ashwini Ponnappa missed out on the quarter-finals by just one point, although they had defeated Singapore's Shinta Mulia Sarai and Lei Yao 21–16, 21–15 in the final Group b match

 Was defeated
 gopichand ne kaha, ‘‘ham jis match kii baat kar rahe hai, vah mahila yugal he
 It is clear that both teams wanted to lose
 ummid he ki is sambandh main koi karrwai kii jaayegi
 The system needs to be changed because if the players had options, it would be fair to say that the Chinese team did not want to play in the quarter-finals
 na to indonesia yaa korian team quarterfinal main china se khelnaa chaahegi
 '' gopichand ne kaha, ‘‘isaliye khilaadi is pranali kaa istemaal padak jeetne ke liye karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 What they are thinking is correct
