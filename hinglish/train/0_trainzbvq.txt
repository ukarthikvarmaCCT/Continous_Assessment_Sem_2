 Call it the fear of the rapid spread of the Aam Aadmi Party or the imitation of Arvind Kejriwal, but in Rajasthan these days, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje is busy in the campaign of simplicity
 khud ke suraksha kafile main kami karne or red lite par rukne jaise kadamon ko lekar janata ke bich surkhiyon main ain vasundhara raaje mukhyamantri nivas main bhi nahin ja rahi hai
 The convoy of CM Vasundhara Raje has been reduced from eight vehicles to three and instead of 18 security personnel, 6 people are deployed in security
 bas, antar itnaa hi he ki vasundhara ko mukhyamantri vaali ambesder car raas nahin aa rahi he, lihaaja ve forchunar main chal rahi hai
 Apart from this, Vasundhara, who landed in the city with her helicopter, is changing so much this time that she is also stopping at red light
 desh main pehla lagjri agasta helicopter kharidne vaali vasundhara raaje ab regular flite se uda karengi
 Even the Chief Minister's residence, which was made grand by Vasundhara after spending crores of rupees, has refused to stay in it
 mantri vasundhara ko 'saadagi kii murti' bataa rahe hai
 The reason for this sudden change in the nature of Vasundhara who took the 'royal oath' on Rajpath is also seen by adding 10 lakh members of AAP in the state since September 8

 When the World Rapid Championship ended in Riyadh last month, winner Viswanathan Anand had no recollection of how many times he had won the World Rapid title
 unhone ungaliyon par ginana shuru kiya lekin ungliyaan kam pad gayi to unhone kandhe uchakaate hue kaha, ''kai baar
 "the famous Chessbase website later calculated that 48-year-old Anand had won the competition 13 times
 inamen 2003 main pehali aupchaarik valrd rapid championships or usase bhi pehle 15 main se 11 anaupchaarik valrd rapid championships kii jeet shaamil he
 The first of these wins was in 1997 when Vladimir Fedosiev, who won a silver medal in Riyadh, was just two years old
 yah ek shandaar record he or 48 saal kii umr main rapid tittle jeetna kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin
 High speed chess is one of the fastest speed games
 isamen shaareerik chusti-furti kii sakchat darkaar hoti he
 "blitz" chess is typically played at a speed of three minutes per player (two extra seconds are added to your watch after every move) while rapid chess is 15 minutes per player (10 extra seconds after each move)
 Let's play with the speed
 ghadi main samay puraa ho jane par zyaadaatar khel bonus samay main khelaa jaataa he
 In this, players move based on instinctive instincts
 roosi khilaadi ise ''haath se khelaa jane vaala shatranj" kehete hai jisamen aap dimag kaa istemaal karnaa band kar dete hai or aapkaa haath apane aap chaal chalata he
 Players move quickly every quarter seconds and make strange mistakes
 aapaki dhadakanon kii rakrataar prati minute 180 tak pahunch jaati he
 To do this for eight hours requires a lot of stamina, mental control and concentration
 anand hameshaa se tej rakrataar khilaadi rahe hai
 He has also won a bronze medal in the World Blitz Championship after a win in rapid competitions
 uske podium par do baar khadey hone vaale ve ekmaatr khilaadi the
 Before the competition, Anand was in a dilemma as to whether he should play in Riyadh or not
 20 lakh dollar se zyada kii puraskaar raashi bahut aakarshak thi
 But he was feeling physically and mentally exhausted due to his dismal performance in the London Chase Classic (he came in last) and was planning to spend a family vacation in Kerala
 ***ve chennai main bete akhil ke saath filmon kaa majaa le rahe the, tabhi patni aruna ne unhen riyaad kii pratiyogita main hissaa lene par vichaar karne ko kaha
 Saudi Arabia does not have its own strong chess players and some influential mullahs believe that the game is "haraam"
 lekin saudi arab aadhuniktaa kii taraf bad rahaa he or teen varsh se is pratiyogita kaa aayojan kar rahaa he, saath hi pratiyogita main puraskaar kii raashi bhi badha di gai he
 It has also removed the requirement of hijab for women and allowed them to play in the same hall where men play
 iske baavjood kai oonchi ranking vaale america khilaadi or 2016 main bltji or rapid pratiyogitaayen jeetne vaale anna mujchichak isse dur hi rahe
 They oppose human rights abuses and harassment of women in Saudi Arabia
 vahaan israeliyon ko bhi vija nahin diya jaataa
 For all these reasons, the future of this championship seems in danger
 phir bhi yah thi bahut kathin
 Anand turned his attention to physical fitness, bypassing politics
 saath hi unhone yah bhi yojana banaai ki khel ke bich main ve kis tarah aaraam karenge
 They lost only one in 38 games (15 rapid games and two tiebreakers and 21 blitz games)
 rapid pratiyogita main ve fedosiv ke saath barabari par rahe lekin tibraker main unhen aasaani se haraa diya
 Speed chase has a great future in many ways
 yah sabase zyada lokapriy online praaroop he kyonki tej gati ke kaaran isamen dhokhadhadi zyada kathin he
 It is also becoming a more popular format in formal competitions as it is over two days due to the high speed
 yah praaroop yuvaaon ko bha rahaa he
 Only 7 of the top 50 ranked players are above 40

 hyderabad ke 'kishandaas and company' kii pratiksha kishandaas or aabhushan diziner puja vaasavani ne najuk aabhushanon kii dekhbhaal karne ke sambandh main ye suzav die hai:1
 Never spray perfume directly on jewelery
 2
 Kundan (uncut diamond) jewelery needs to be kept in a plastic box with a sponge or cotton, as it can turn black when exposed to other chemicals
 3
 Emerald is a very soft and delicate stone
 panna ke aabhushan baithkar hi pahanen, taaki inke girakar tuutane kii sambhaavna na ho
 4
 basra (asli) moti ko malamal ke kapade main lapetakar rakhana chahie
 Avoid wearing them in summer, as they can lose their shine when exposed to sweat
 5
 Place the jewelery in a box with multiple grooves or in a separate box, because when put together, there may be a scratch or there is a possibility of them breaking apart
 6
 Do not clean any jewelry other than diamonds with soap or water
 7
 You can use an eraser to remove stains on the jewelery
 'mujhe us din se apane pati par shaq hone laga'8
 Clean the jewelery at regular intervals
 yah unhen saaf, chakdaar va hameshaa nayaa banaae rakhega
 Not all jewelery or stones should be cleaned in the same way
 9
 Gold is a fragile metal and can easily get scratched
 ise kharonch se bachaane kii koshish karen or uchit policing or rakrakhaav ke liye apane jeweler se salaah lete rahen
 Getting married can reduce depression 10

 Also, avoid wearing gems in strong heat or light, as its color flies away and it becomes colorless
 11
 To protect the jewelery from any kind of damage, wear it only after applying makeup, lotion, perfume

 BJP President Rajnath Singh on Tuesday dismissed reports that the party was under pressure from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) over the issue of crisis arising out of senior party leader LK Advani resigning from all party posts
 sutron kaa kahana he ki adwani ne unase milane aae netaaon ko kaha he ki narendra modi desh ke netritv ke liye sahi nahin hai
 He said that such reports are baseless
 rajnath ne kaha, ‘‘main ek cheez spasht kar dena chahta hum ki kuch samachar channelon par khabar chali he ki aresas ne yah kaha he yaa vah kaha he
 i want to make it clear that the Sangh has not said anything
 ’’ He said, "I have found out from the people in the Sangh, have they made any statement
" unhone mujhe bataaya ki unki taraf se koi bayaan nahin diya gaya he, ye sab khabaren puri tarah niraadhaar hai
 '' media kii khabaron main purv main daawa kiya gaya tha ki is mudde par aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat or rajnath singh ke bich charchaa hui he
 Sources said both the BJP and RSS were of the opinion that Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi should not be overtaken by the decision to be appointed as the head of the election campaign committee
 haalanki, unka maananaa tha ki adwani ko uchit sammaan diya janaa chahie or unhen manaane ke sabhi prayaas kiye jane chahie, taaki vah apana istipha waapas le len
 On the question of the possibility of Advani's return, Rajnath Singh did not give any answer and then he left for Rajasthan today
 bijepi ke sansadeey board ne laal krishna adwani ke istife ko naamanzoor kar diya he
 Simultaneously, efforts are on to convince him
 isse pehle, goa main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak ke samaapan ke thik ek din baad somvaar ko party ke kaddavar netaa laalkrishna adwani ke sabhi padon se istipha dene ke baad party main koharaam much gaya
 Advani, who is opposed to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, has alleged that most of the party leaders are only giving preference to their personal agenda
 goa main bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak ke aakhri din ravivaar ko aam chunaav ke liye bhaajapa kii prachaar samiti ke adhyaksh ke rup main narendra modi ko niyukt kiya gaya tha
 If Advani's unexpected decision does not change, it simply means that Modi will have to be approved as the prime ministerial candidate in the 2014 general election
 shaam tak chale ghatnakram main bhaajapa ke varisht netaa adwani ko manaane ke liye unke awaas par jame rahe
 Fearful of the split within the party, the BJP called its parliamentary board meeting in a hurry
 sansadeey board party kii teen sheersh nikaayon main se ek he
 The two other bodies are the National Executive and the Election Committee
 gujarat se modi ne adwani se apana istipha waapas lene kaa aagrah kiya or apane netaa se party ke lakhon kaaryakartaaon ko niraash nahin karne kii apil kii
 From the formation of the BJP in the 1980s to making it politically strong and giving a strong Hinduist ideology to the party, Advani could not succeed in upgrading Modi
 apana virodh jataane ke liye unhone rashtriya kaaryakarini, sansadeey board or chunaav samiti se hi istipha de diya
 Advani has written an angry letter to party president Rajnath Singh
 teen pare ke patr main modi kaa kahin bhi zikr nahin he, lekin iske swar se spasht he ki party kii goa baithak main ravivaar ko modi kaa kad badaye jane se hi istipha judaa hua he
 Advani has said, "for some time i have been finding it difficult to keep pace with the current functioning of the party and the direction in which the party is going
 " Advani has said that there is "no longer a feeling in anyone's mind that it is the same idealist party that was raised by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, Nanaji Deshmukh and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, whose only concern is the country and Was about the people of the country
 " Advani wrote in the letter, "most of our leaders are now only concerned about their personal agenda
 " is tarah adwani ne bhaajapa netaaon kii abtak sabase kadi aalochana kii he, or isse party kaa aantarik kalah khulkar baahar aa gaya he
 Advani further wrote, "so i have decided to resign from the three key posts of the party - National Executive, Parliamentary Board and Election Committee
 ise meraa tyaagptr samajha ja saktaa he
 "advani is now just a member of the BJP
 adwani ke istife se bhaajapa sann rah gai he
 Most of the leaders, who were in the forefront of Modi's elevation till Monday morning, initially refused to react to it
 bhaajapa kii vaicharik rup se abhibhavak sanstha, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ne is ghatana ko atyant durbhagyapurna bataaya
 Within an hour of his resignation, the BJP said an attempt would be made to persuade Advani
 rajnath singh ne twit kiya ki unhone adwani kaa istipha sweekaar nahin kiya he
 Sharad Yadav, president of the NDA constituent, Janata dal-united (JDU), said, “it is sad
 
 This is not good for the NDA
 " BJP MP from Goa Shripad Naik said, “it is really unfortunate
 " bhaajapa netaa sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki party ko bharosa he ki vah adwani ko istipha waapas lene ke liye kah sakati he
 The Congress appeared happy with the civil war that broke out in the BJP
 congress mahasachiv janardan dvivedi ne kaha, "is par bhaajapa ko sochna he
 The person concerned has to think
 hamane pehle hi kaha tha ki iske (modi kaa unnayan) apane nattejey honge
 "comments adwani 1947 main aresas se jude or jab 1951 main jansangh kii sthapana hui to usase bhi jud gaye
 In 1986, he took charge as the BJP President when it had only two mps in the Lok Sabha
 adhyaksh banane ke tatkaal baad adwani ram mandir andolan ke prabal samarthak ban gaye
 This movement helped the BJP to move forward and after that it emerged as a big party
 unhone kaha ki is tarah kii khabaren niraadhaar hai
 Rajnath said, "I want to make one thing clear that there is news on some news channels that the RSS has said this or that
 main puri tarah spasht karnaa chahta hum ki sangh ne kuch nahin kaha he
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘maine sangh main logon se pataa kiya he, kya unhone koi bayaan diya he
 They told me that no statement has been made on their behalf, all these reports are completely baseless
 ’’ Media reports had earlier claimed that the issue was discussed between RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and Rajnath Singh
 sutron ne bataaya ki bhaajapa or aresas donon kaa yah mat tha ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke pramukh ke rup main niyukt kiye jane ke faisle se peeche nahin hataa janaa chahie
 However, he believed that Advani should be given due respect and all efforts should be made to persuade him to withdraw his resignation
 adwani kii vaapasi kii sambhaavnaaon ke prashn par rajnath singh ne koi jawaab nahin diya or phir vah aaj rajasthan ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye
 bjp's parliamentary board has rejected the resignation of Lal Krishna Advani
 iske saath-saath unhen manaane ke prayaas lagaataar jari hai
 Earlier, on Monday, a day after the conclusion of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) National Executive meeting in Goa, the party created a furore after the party's leader LK Advani resigned from all posts
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke unnayan virdohi adwani ne aarope lagaaya he ki party ke adhikansh netaa sirf apane nijee agenda ko tarjeeh de rahe hai
 Narendra Modi was appointed as the chairman of the bjp's campaign committee for the general election on Sunday, the last day of the bjp's national executive meeting in Goa
 adwani kaa apratyaashit faisla yadi nahin badalata he to iskaa sidhaa sa matlab modi ko 2014 ke aam chunaav main pradhanmantri pad kaa pratyaashee ke rup main manjuuri pradaan kiya janaa hoga
 Senior leaders of BJP stayed at Advani's residence to convince Advani in the events that went on till the evening
 party ke bheetar foot saarvajanik hone se ghabaraai bhaajapa ne aanan fanan main apni sansadeey board kii baithak bulaai
 The Parliamentary Board is one of the three top bodies of the party
 do anya nikaay rashtriya kaaryakarini or chunaav samiti hai
 Modi from Gujarat urged Advani to withdraw his resignation and appealed to his leader not to disappoint the lakhs of party workers
 1980 ke dashak main bhaajapa ke gathan se lekar ise raajnneetik rup se sabal banane vaale or party ko dhur hinduvadi vichaardhaara dene vaale adwani modi kaa unnayan karne se rokane main kaamyaab nahin ho sake
 To express his opposition, he resigned from the National Executive, Parliamentary Board and Election Committee
 adwani ne party adhyaksh rajnath singh ko ek naaraazgi bharaa patr likhaa he
 There is no mention of Modi anywhere in the three-foot letter, but it is clear from its tone that the resignation is linked to Modi's height in the party's Goa meeting on Sunday
 adwani ne kaha he, "kuch samay se main party ke maujuuda kaamkaaj se or jis disha main party ja rahi he, usase talmail bithaane main kathinaayee mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 " adwani ne kaha he ki ab "kisi ke man main yah bhaavana nahin rah gai he ki yah vahi adarshavaadi party he, jise shyama prasad mukherjee, pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay, nanaaji deshmukh or atal bihari vaajapeyi ne khadaa kiya tha, jinaki ek maatr chintaa desh or desh kii janata ko lekar thi
 " adwani ne patr main likhaa he, "hamaare adhikansh netaa ab maatr apane nijee agenda ko lekar chintit hai
 "in this way, Advani has so far criticized the BJP leaders, and this has brought out the internal infighting of the party
 adwani ne aage likhaa he, "isliye maine party ke teen pramukh padon - rashtriya kaaryakarini, sansadeey board or chunaav samiti se istipha dene kaa nirnay liya he
 This can be considered my resignation
 " adwani ab sirf bhaajapa ke sadsy bhar rah gaye hai
 BJP is stunned by Advani's resignation
 adhikansh netaa, jo somvaar subah tak modi ke unnayan ke khumaar main the, unhone shuru main is par koi pratikriya dene se inkaar kar diya
 bjp's ideological parent organization, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), described the incident as extremely unfortunate
 istipha milane ke ek ghante ke andar bhaajapa ne kaha ki adwani ko manaane kii koshish kii jaaegi
 Rajnath Singh tweeted that he has not accepted Advani's resignation
 rajg ke ghatak dal, janata dal-united (jadyu) ke adhyaksh sharad yadav ne kaha, "yah dukhad he
 
 yah rajg ke liye acha nahin he
 " goa se bhaajapa saansad shripad nike ne kaha, "yah vaaki main durbhagyapurna he
 "BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said that the party was confident that she could ask Advani to withdraw her resignation
 bhaajapa main chhide grihayuddh se congress khush najar ai
 Congress general secretary Janardan Dwivedi said, "BJP has to think on this
 sambandhit vyakti ko sochna he

 input: bhashaa There was no consensus in the all-party meeting convened by the government on Sunday for the proposed Lokpal Bill to overcome corruption
 yah tay kiya gaya ki sarkaar sansad ke aagaamee satr main ek majboot or prabhavakaari vidheyak pesh kare or us samay sabhi dal apane vichaar rakhenge

 Earlier, at the commencement of the meeting, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the government is committed to the formation of a strong and influential Lokpal to deal with high-level corruption cases, but by keeping it in sync with other institutions and laws and the core of the Constitution Will have to work under the framework

 This statement of the Prime Minister is being considered important in view of the attitude of Anna Hazare that the Prime Minister and the High Judiciary should come under the purview of Lokpal
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki aisa karne se sarkaar ke samanaantar ek or dhaancha nirmit ho jayega
 On the other hand, advocating the strong and effective Lokpal Bill, Ranveer Singh Prajapati of the Indian National Lok Dal said, "all the people have been given equal status in the constitution of our country, so the Prime Minister should also be brought under its ambit
" telugu desham party (tedepa) ke namaa nageshwar raav ne kaha, lokapal vidheyak laane main ab or deree nahin kii jaani chahie or pradhanmantri ko bhi lokapal ke daayre main laayaa janaa chahie

 In the list of Bollywood's most popular Khans, Saif Ali Khan always finished fourth
 phir bhi, unhone vividhtapurna bhoomikaayen nibhaai hai jo aksar chunauteepurn rahi hai or inke jariye film jagat par unhone apni chhap bhi chodi he
 He became the lame Tyagi in Omkara (2006), and Jugadu Banda, who manipulated Being Cyrus (2006)
 phir, go goa gon (2013) main, unhone ek punjabi jombi shikari kii bhoomika nibhaai, jo yah sochataa he ki vah roosi he
 This year, we see him again in Netflix's Sacred Games as an emotionally vulnerable police officer Sartaj Singh who struggles to save Mumbai
 is saal ke ant main navdeep singh kii film laal captain main ve krur shikari kii bhoomika main dikhenge, jo 18veen shatabdi ke bharat main shikaar par nikalataa he
 His recent films — Chef (2017) and Kalakandi (2017) show that Saif is not very keen on box office collections by working on the Ghisepite formula
 saf kehete hai, ''kabhi-kabhi jab ham kaam karte hai, to hamen paise ke liye kaam karnaa padataa he, jiskaa matlab he ki hamen bazaar ke niyamon ke anusaar chalanaa hoga
 Before the Sacred Games, there was a time when my inclination was more about how the work was done rather than what the effect would be
 aap usee dhun main chalate rahete hai or chijen bikhar jaati hai
 "for Saif, Sacred Games is a greater means of its 'artistic' expression, less of a liability
" yahi vajah thi ki lekhak-nirdeshak jodi raaj or di
 K
 main se krishna di
 K
 jombi kamedi go goa gon kii patakatha lekar unke paas gaye to script sunne ke baad, saf ne ise 'chu xxrep 4 * or paagalpan' kaha tha
 He not only agreed to act but also agreed to produce it
 di
 K
 kehete hai, ''unamem bacchon jaisaa utsaah or jigyaasa he
 There is a lot of desire in them to do something different
 usamen jabardast umang he jo kabhi-kabhi sahi sabit hoti he to kabhi-kabhi nahin
 Despite the failures, Saif has managed to save himself
 aalochak, nishchit rup se, iskaa shrey unke khandaan ko dete hai—ve mashhoor adaakara sharmila tagore or cricketer mansoor ali khan pataudi ke bete hai—lekin saf ne lagaataar vah rasta chunaa he jis par zyada log nahin chale
 He has always accepted challenges and has never followed a safe formula
 udhaaharan ke liye, raaj or dike kii hapi anding (2014) main nayak kii bhoomika ke liye taiyaar hokar, saf ne dikhaaya ki ve un chuninda abhinaytaon main se hai jo 'adaakaari' kaa marm samajhane kii koshish karte hai
 The film was a satire on such romantic comedies as Khan did and made him popular
 waisi filmon main imtiyaaj ali kii lav aaj kal (2009) or homi adzania kii cocktail (2012)—jo unki sabase badi hit filmon main maani jaati hai
 Imtiaz, who has known Saif for a long time, tells him about internal things: "people do not know in which category they are placed
 ve yah sochakar sahaj hai ki ve alag tarah ke insaan ho sakate hai
 He is truthful but full of many contradictions, as does a poet of the 21st century
 ek hi samay par ve aapako bahut gyani or murkh lag sakate hai
 His mind keeps wandering over a lot of things which are not common among the people
 unka drushtikon vyapak or sahaj he
 In 2019, Khan will appear in Navdeep Singh's new historical action drama Lal Kaptan
 navdeep kehete hai, ''ham is kirdaar ke liye karishmai or sahaj swabhaav kaa aadmi chaahate the or saf main ye khubiyaan hai
 "his work became easier because of the influence of Saif, some of whom were from Hollywood
" '' ve kaaphi padhate rahete hai or unhen jaankaree rahati he isliye baat aasaan ho jaati he
 "writer-director" also considers Saif "his mischievous temperament, good humor"
 haalanki abhi unka secred games chaaya hua he
 The first season of the show featured a lot of color among all the characters but Saif's character, Sartaj, is different from others due to his many weaknesses
 haalanki sartaaj satya ke prati patibaddh he lekin saf kehete hai, ''vah chalau bollywood hero nahin he
 Saif believes Sartaj is the 'moral foundation' that keeps the entire show balanced
 secred games kii rochakata vastav main sartaaj ke kirdaar ke anaadi se bahadur banane ke saath badhati jaati he
 Saif says, "sartaj is someone who gets involved in clever preaching and tries to find solutions to problems in the religion, or ashram of his Guruji (pankaj Tripathi)
" '' saf ke shabdon main ''kahani main tehraav, utaar-chadhaav, rochak mode hai
 It is one of the best writing and some of the best artistic productions emanating from India
 '' saf ne jis eemaandaaree se kariyar ko sambhala he, aap unki daad die bina nahin rah sakate
 *** bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ab darshanik hote ja rahe hai or yah baat unke fasebuk pej par post kii gai panktiyon se pataa lagati he
 On Sunday, when his helicopter got stuck in the stormy weather, he wrote on his Facebook - At that time i was free from all kinds of worries
 main sirf apni jindagi ke bare main soch rahaa tha
 An English newspaper reported this
 naa ram kaa hua, naa rahamaan kaa huakuch kabir si fitrat thi, har insaan kaa hua
 What did Nitish Kumar write on his Facebook wall that all critics and critics came into the fray
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki darasal yah fasaana unki raajnneetik sthiti kaa ullekh karata he
 Majority of the Hindu people of Bihar stand in support of Modi while Muslims with their arch rival Lalu Prasad Yadav
 pichley saal jab nitish kumaar ne modi ke naam par bijepi se naata todaa to unhen laga ki tamaam musalmaan unke saath aa jaaenge
 On the other hand Hindus will support them because they have brought Bihar out of hell for 15 years
 lekin nitish kumaar kaa ganit thik nahin baitha
 Despite Modi's 'sacrifice' and the justice of the victims of the horrific riots in Bhagalpur, Muslims did not look at him
 iskaa hi udhaaharan tha ki kishanganj se unki party ke ummidavaar congress ke samarthan main maidan chhod gaye
 This seat is Muslim majority
 iske alaava unke kuch anya muslim ummidavaaron par maidan chhod dene ke liye baari dabaav padaa
 On the other hand, the upper castes turned against him as he broke the alliance
 nae jativaadee sameekaran banane ke unke prayaas ko bhi kaaphi dhakka laga
 His party's candidates appeared weak in the face of BJP-LJP alliance and lalu-congress rivals
 ab nitish yah dikhaane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki unhen isse fark nahin padataa
 But that couplet shows his mentality that he has posted on Facebook
 unhone yah bhi likhaa ki us tufaan main main janata kii seva karte-karte shahid ho jaataa
 He has posted many more comments on Facebook
 unhone congress or lalu par is baat ke liye hamalaa bhi kiya he ki unhone apane phaayde ke liye musalamaanon ke man main modi ke prati bhay paidaa kiya
 He also wrote about Lalu that he has been sentenced to five years and he can go to jail anytime
 jab vah jail chale jaaenge to unki party ke tukade ho jaaenge

 ”lekin iske saath hi unhone apane bhagya ko saraahaa bhi ki unhen badhibia role mil gaya he

 He saw so much similarity between his father and this character that in many scenes he wore his father's shirt
 is charitra ke madhyam se sanjay ne apane jivan main pita kii bhoomika ke prati jaise aabhaar jataayaa he

 Sanjay brings a sense of seriousness to it

 BAADDUUMMB xxrep 4 a The film 'krrish-3' or 'jab Tak Hai Jaan', many such films have been released on the day of Diwali, then it was 2 days before Diwali Friday or 3 days ago
 diwali ke maukey par release hone vaali filmon ko diwali ke din hi release kar diya jaataa he taaki lambii chuttee or weekend kaa phayda film ko mili
 But Salman Khan's film 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' is being released on the second day of Diwali
 aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki aisa kyon ho rahaa he ki film diwali ke din release naa hokar diwali ke duusare din release ho rahi he? khaas sutara bataate hai kii diwali ke duusare din 'prem ratan dhan payo' ko release karke salmaan khan pehle din sabase zyaada kamai karne vaali film bananaa chaahate hai
 The comments darasal pehle din sabase zyaada 40 karod kaa kollection kar shahrukh khan kii film 'happy new year' sabase aage he or 'prem ratan dhan payo' pehle din 40 karod se zyaada collection karke nayaa kirtiman sthapit karnaa chaahati he
 Sources reveal that this decision has been taken very thoughtfully
 diwali ke din shaam main log puja or milane julne main vyast rahete hai isliye shaam main collection bada nahin hota
 In such a situation, 'prem Ratam Dhan Payo' cannot make a record on the first day
 isliye diwali ke duusare din yah film release kii ja rahi he taaki is chuttee ke din darshak baari sankhya main film dekhne jaaen or box offis par is film ko nayaa kirtiman banane kaa mauka mili
 By the way, if Salman Khan's film is being released on a festival like Diwali, then the expectation is that there will be a new record film
 magar 40 karod kaa shahrukh kaa record todegi yaa nahin, diwali ke duusare din yani 12 november kii raat tak pataa chal jaayegaa
 In such a situation, the question arises that why is the film not being released on the day of Diwali but being released on the second day of Diwali? Special sources tell that by releasing 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' on the second day of Diwali, Salman Khan wants to make the highest grossing film on the first day
 tippaniyan Actually, Shahrukh Khan's film 'happy New Year' is at the forefront with the highest collection of 40 crores on the first day and 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' wants to set a new record by collecting more than 40 crores on the first day
 sutara bataate hai ki bahut hi soch samajhakar ye nirnay liya gaya he
 On the day of Diwali, people are busy in worshiping and meeting in the evening, so the collection is not big in the evening
 aise main 'prem ratam dhan payo' pehle din record nahin bana sakati
 Therefore, the film is being released on the second day of Diwali so that on this holiday, viewers go to see a large number of films and get a chance to make the film a new record at the box office
 vaise salmaan khan kii film agar diwali jaise tyohaar par release ho rahi he to ummid aisi hi hogi ki koi na koi nayaa record film zarur banaaegi
 But whether Shahrukh's record of 40 crores will be broken or not, it will be known by the second day of Diwali i
e
 November 12 night
 darasal pehle din sabase zyaada 40 karod kaa kollection kar shahrukh khan kii film 'happy new year' sabase aage he or 'prem ratan dhan payo' pehle din 40 karod se zyaada collection karke nayaa kirtiman sthapit karnaa chaahati he

 It is worth noting that today the election results of 270 seats in total have been made in the three mcds of Delhi
 bijepi ko jahaan in chunaavon main 184 siton par jeet mili hai to vahiin aam aadmi party or congress kramshah 46 or 30 siton par hi jeet hasil karne main safal rahi hai
 Other candidates have won 10 seats
 kisi bhi chunaav main khadey ummidavaar ko apnijmanat bachaane ke liye kul pade votonka kam se kam chatha hissaa hasil karnaa hota he
 The number of candidates who could not save their bail in these elections will be given only after the results are declared, but if it is seen from the seats, then it can be said that the parties should save at least 45 seats to save their bail
 (one sixth of 270) should have won
 aam aadmi party 46 siten hi jeet saki he jabaki congress ko to mahaj 30 siten mili hai
 It is clear that if the candidate's confiscation formula is applied to the parties, it can be said that with the unprecedented victory two years ago, the Aam Aadmi Party, which held Delhi's power, somehow managed to save its bail
 vaise kuch din pehle rajouri garden vidhansabha upachunaav main bhi aam aadmi party kaa ummidavaar apni jamaanat nahin bachaa paaya tha jabaki ye seat AAP ke hi jaranel singh ke istipha dene ke baad khaali hui thi

 Bipin Chandra started his career as a teacher from Hindu College in Delhi
 iske baad unhone kai saal tak dilli uniwarsity main padhaayaa or 1971 main ve jawaharlal nehru uniwarsity se jud gaye

K
 gopal jaisi jaani-maani hastiyaan shaamil thim
 We used to look at them all with great vision and inspiration
 shraddha kii najar se isliye kyonki unhone bharat ko duniyabar main alag pahchaan dilaai thi
 This group of historians gave a glimpse of the political mood of the country, the radical mood
 tab tak nehru yug khatm ho chukaa tha
 Pandit Nehru was killed
 phir bhi dharmanirpekshata, vikaas, vigyaan or takanic or shiksha kaa prasar jaise nehru yug ke vichaaron ke liye baari patibadghta maujuud thi
 Optimism was still sufficient and it was also reflected in the world philosophy of these historians
 lekin ve yathasthiti banaae rakhane ke pakshdhar nahin the, ve to iske aalochak the
 He had prepared his own questions and also answered them which did not correspond to the established world philosophy
 us dauraan duniyabar main chal rahe umdaa kism ke kaamon ke bare main hamane padhaa tha
 But the work of these personalities was different and unique
 ye ek tarah kii nai awaajen thim
 His ideas and principles were completely different
 iske baavjood, bharat main itihaas lekhan kis tarah hona chahie, uske swaroop ko lekar ve sab ekamat the
 His global philosophy was similar, which was not necessarily always Marxist
 yah marxvad or nehruwad kaa mail tha
 Their appeal was overwhelming as they were not impractical
 ve jaanate the ki kis cheez kii ahmiyat he
 This is reflected in his influential commentaries on the British Raj
 da rij and growth of iconomic nesanalism chandra kii sabase ahm kriti maani jaati he
 In this, he has identified economic nationalism as an important factor in the development of public awareness with the help of systematic and elaborate resources
 ve yah sabit karne main safal hue ki gopal krishna gokhale, firozshah mehta or dadabhai nauroji sareekhe congress ke kuch netaa sabhy or amir samaaj se the, iske baavjood bhi ve garibi, asamanta or ghatati ja rahi sampada jaise muddon se nibatane ke liye bhinn shreniyon ke hiton ko samaj sake the
 It is not the first time that British policies have been criticized
 nauroji yah kaam kar chuke the
 But Chandra gave it a special direction and trend
 chandra kii khaas baat thi rashtravaadi andolan kaa samarthan karne kaa unka tarika
 It was widely criticized
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki gandhi ke netritv main chale us mahaan andolan ko vakt ke us mode par yun pahchaan milanaa british upniveshwaad ke chalaave ko khatm karne ke liye behad ahm tha
 There are some occasions in the history of every country when a person or idea has been fully appreciated
 sambhav he aap isse sahamat na hon lekin yah baat puri tarah se taarkik he
 Chandra was not only a thinker, but also a great teacher
 dilli uniwarsity main shikshak rahane ke dauraan ve apane academik kariyar ke sheersh par the
 He encouraged his students to ask questions
 ve unke saath mithravat ho jate the or sahaj sampark bana lete the
 Anywhere, this is the greatest achievement of any teacher
 isiilie chaatr unke prashansak the
 Even students from other disciplines and faculty were attracted to him
 is myne main ve kuch-kuch eemyu ke mohammad habib kii tarah the
 Well, now that phase has passed
 saamaajik vigyaan ke prati aisa udaar najariya rakhane vaale shikshak ab nahin hai
 Had he been today, he would have raised his voice against today's serious issues like western imperialism and injustice in society
 bataur lekhak apane kariyar ke antim padaav par unhone jo mahatvapurn kaam kiya vah sampradayikta ko lekar tha
 There was a freshness in his outlook
 yah bahut had tak isliye kyonki unhone sampradayikta ke khilaaf ladaai ched di thi, shaayad isliye kyonki apni yuvavastha or baad ke varshon main unhone iskaa khaasaa anubhav praapt kiya tha
 He was the one who brought up the concept of illusory awareness, which basically meant that there is no such thing as communalism in reality because it does not exist in the society - it was started by the British and even after they left Indian Society kept it alive because of its vested interests
 chandra alpsankhyak or bahusankhyak, donon tarah kii sampradayikta ko ek jaisaa hi maanate the or unke mutabik, donon tarah kii sampradayikta kharaab hoti he
 As an activist he fought against these two
 shaayad hamamen se kuch log ise bhraamak jaagrukta nahin maanenge
 We believe that the roots of communalism in Indian society are very deep and insecurity of minorities also needs attention
 is mat bhinnata ke baavjood, yah hastkshep mahatvapurn tha

 Politics continues on Mumbai's Campa Cola Society case
 maamle kaa raajnneetik phayda uthaane kii res main shiv sena bhi peeche nahin he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has questioned the Supreme Court's decision on the matter
 uddhav ne party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main likhaa he ki campa cola sosayadi maamla nyaay vyavastha kii kabrgah sabit ho rahaa he
 In fact, the Supreme Court has ordered the illegal flat holders of the Campa Cola Society to vacate the Campa Cola complex by 31 May 2014
 uddhav thakare ne supreme court par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki is masale par gambhirtha se sochane kii bajaae aanan-fanan main hal karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 He said that 140 families of the Campa Cola Society should be relieved
 uddhav ne apane sampadakeey main likhaa he ki, 'campa cola ke 140 pariwaron ko nyaay koun degaa? adaalatein itani jimmedaar hai ki aatankwaadiyon ko jinda rakhti hai lekin duusari taraf 140 pariwaron ko maut ke daravaaje tak bhejne main koi hichak nahin hui
 He said, 'the law should be strict but not insensitive
 mumbai main baharaampada, munkhard, govendi jaise ilaake avaidh nirmaan kaa garh hai or yahaan chota pakistan basataa he
 But neither the BMC, nor the state government nor the court tried to run a bulldozer here
 ''maanavadhikaar sanghathan bhi kyon hai chup?'unhone kaha, 'mujhe is baat par hairaani he ki aakhir is mudde par maanavadhikaar sanghathan kaise chup baithe hai? kya in logon ko tab insaaf milegaa jab ye log supreme court ke baahar aatmadah karenge?
 How can a court sympathetic to terrorists like Kasab and Afzal Guru take away the lives of 140 families for their false reputation
 aaj jab supreme court balaatkaariyon par faisla suna rahaa he tab is sheersh court ke jaj rape ke aaropon kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 What kind of morality is this? If similar charges were leveled against an officer or leader, then that court would have put him behind bars
 court ne apni tikhi tippaniyon se uski chhavi kii dhajjiyaan uda di hoti
 Repeatedly changing the court's stand on the Campa Cola case is like playing garba
 'unhone kaha, 'daagi netaa jail se chunaav lard sakate hai yaa nahin, agar is maamle par supreme court apana faisla badal saktaa he to campa cola cese main kyon nahin? isse pehle bhi kai baar avaidh nirmaan ko niyamit kiya gaya he
 The disputed Kandivali plot, where the MCA Gymkhana was built, was also regularized
 ye sports complex kisi bhi tarah se aam aadmi ko phayda nahin pahunchaa rahaa he
 But legalizing the Campa Cola Society is beyond the scope of their law !
 mukhyamantri par bhi saadhaa nishanaudhav thakare ne kaha he ki sinchai ghotaale ke dauraan siem ko pad se nahin hataaya gaya
 Everyone, including the court, kept their eyes closed
 140 pariwaron ko bachaane ke liye bhi is tarah ankhen moonden rakhni chahie
 The Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi is once again seen to be in trouble in the matter of appointment of parliamentary secretaries
 chunaav ayog ne sattashin aam aadmi party ke 21 vidhayakon ko 'laabh kaa pad' maamle main kaaran bataao notice jari kiya he
 Significantly, last year, these mlas have been appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary by the Chief Minister
 niyukti ko lekar edwocket prashanth patel kii yachika par ayog ne yah notice jari kiya he
 The mlas have been asked to respond to the notice by 11 April

 He wrote with it, 'the Aam Aadmi Party propagated its austerity and honesty, but the greed of power broke every rule

 One of the films released this Friday is 'kukku Mathur Ki Jhand Ho Gayi', directed by Aman Sachdeva, and produced by Ekta Kapoor and Bijoy Nambiar
 
 
 'kukku maathur kii jhand ho gai' do doston kii kahani he, jinamein siddharth gupta bane hai kukku, or ashish juneja ne roni kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 
 
 Kukku lives with his father and sister, and is not his mother, and that is why he deserves the kindness of his friend and his mother
 
 
 donon dost zindagi main kuch banane kaa sapana dekhte rahete hai
 
 
 For example, Cuckoo wants to open a restaurant because he is a great cook, but Ronnie is pushed into a clothing store, his family business
 
 
 iske baad kya hota he, kyon do doston ke bich daraar aa jaati he, beizzat hone ke baad kukku apane dost or uske parivaar ke saath kya karata he - yah sab jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni hogi
 
 
 Now let's talk about the merits and demerits of the film
 
 
 film kaa sheershak dekhakar lagata he ki yah ek kamedi film hogi, lekin aisa nahin he, haalanki film dekhte vakt aap kai jagah muskuraaenge zarur
 
 
 There is innocence in the story of 'kukku Mathur Ki Jhand Ho Gayi', the 'one line idea' of the film is also good, but it was not spread in the manner
 
 
 screenple or dialog main or mehnat kiye jane kii zarurat thi
 
 
 Siddharth and Ashish are fine in their roles, but in many places they seem to lack energy, or rather, enthusiasm
 
 
 prabhakar ke kirdaar main amit sayaal kaa kaam acha he
 
 
 In songs 'welcome Maia'
 
 
 ' aapako hansaa saktaa he or aakhir tak aapako yah gaanaa shaayad yaad bhi rahe
 
 
 It would not be wrong to say that director Aman Sachdeva has created very good moments for the audience in many scenes, be it the scene of Jagran or the shooting of a Haryanvi film, or a character inspired by Nirmal Baba
 
 
 cinemetography or editing vibhaag kaa kaam thodaa kamazor dikhaa, lekin phir bhi aman sachdeva kii thik-thaak koshish nazar ai, kyonki oobad−khabad safar ke baavjood film dekhakar aapkaa manoranjan ho saktaa he
 
 
 My rating for this film is - 2
 5 star
