 Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, the brightest star in cricket
 wo shakhsiyat jisase judakar aword bhi sammanit hote hai lekin sachin ke chaahanewaalon ko sachin ke liye chahat he or intazaar he bharat ke sabase bade sammaan kaa yani bharat ratna kaa
 But it seems that the wait is shortened now
 piemo ko sifarish kii gai he ki sports category main bhi bharat ratna diya janaa chahie
 So very soon Sachin may be called Bharat Ratna
 sachin ke is sammaan kii raah main thi ek aadchan
 The people associated with the sport had not yet received this honor
 ab tamaam adchanon ko khatm kiya ja rahaa he
 The Sports Ministry had demanded from the Ministry of Home Affairs that Bharat Ratna be honored in the sports category as well
 grih mantralay ne ye maang maan lee he or ab ye sifarish piemo ko bhej di gai he
 Tendulkar deserves Bharat Ratna: Vilasrao Deshmukh is clear that if the recommendation is approved by the PMO, then the most powerful contender in the sports category will be Sachin Tendulkar
 lambey vakt se unhen ye sammaan dene kii maang jo chal rahi he
 For 21 years, the world has been witnessing the charisma of Sachin and that is why the demand of giving Bharat Ratna to Sachin kept rising again and again
 38 saal kaa ye jaadugar recordon ke everest par baitha he, jisatak pahunch paanaa lagbhag naammumkin he
 In 453 ODI matches, Sachin has scored the most 18111 runs
 itnaa hi nahin test main bhi sachin sabase zyada ran banane vaale ballebaaj hai
 Sachin's bat run knows the rain well
 sachin cricket kii kitaab har shot khilne main maahir hai
 Sachin did not score a single century in his 79 odis, but Sachin is the highest hundred batsman today
 test maichon main sachin shatko kaa ardhshtak bana chuke hai
 Sachin has scored a total of 51 centuries in Test matches
 yahi nahin vande main 48 baar sachin kaa balla shatak jad chukaa he
 Sachin is just one century away from scoring centuries in international cricket
 vanade kii ek pari main 200 ran banane vaale sachin duniya ke iklaute ballebaaj hai
 Seeking the title of knighthood to Sachin, Sachin came to be called the Don Bradman of today
 duniyabar main sachin or breadman kii tulana shuru ho gai
 For this, an Australian newspaper conducted a survey, in which it was clear that Sachin was ahead of Bradman
 is survey main 67 fisadi logon ne sachin ko chunaa to vahiin mahaj 33 fisadi logo kii raay thi ki breadman sachin se aage hai
 The whole world is watching Sachin's might
 is laadle par hindustan fakr karata he
 In such a situation, every cricket lover wants Sachin to get Bharat Ratna
 jaise hi pataa chalaa ki sachin ko bharat ratna die jane kaa rasta saaf ho chukaa he
 It felt as if a year-old wish had been fulfilled
 bisisiai ke upaadhyaksh or sansadeey rajya mantri rajeev shukla to jane kab se is din kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 Sachin has made so many records not known in the name of the country
 lekin ye pehali baar hoga jab kisi khilaadi ko desh kaa sabase bada naagarik sammaan dekar hamaari sarkaar ne nayaa record banane kaa faisla kiya he
 Obviously, other cricketers of the country are also feeling proud with this honor given to Sachin
 mobile par taaja khabaren, photo, video dekhenschin ko bharat ratna die jane kii pahal isliye or mahatvapurn ho he kyonki iske liye niyam badale gaye hai
 Every rule is short before Sachin's personality
 der se hi sahi sarkaar ne is baat ko kubul kar liya he
 However, some feel that the decision to award Bharat Ratna to Sachin is a matter of policy change
 nitiyon kii sachai to sarkaar jane lekin sachin ko chaahane vaale unke liye hameshaa dua karte rahenge
 Needless to say that in a country where people consider Sachin to be God, not a cricketer, there has been victory of faith and achievements
 sachin ke liye bharat ratna kaa raah aasaan karnaa isi kaa saboot he
 The triple talaq bill is still stuck in the Rajya Sabha, but since the passage of Lok Sabha, action has started against the three divorcees

 But a proposal that kills the soul of the Bill and increases injustice against women will not be accepted

 vaise ham ye vajah to aapako nahin bataa sakate lekin kuch tasviren jo soshal media par ye kahkar share ho rahi hai ki ye'bahubali 2'kii shooting kii hai, wo dikhaa sakate hai

 is baat se to koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa he ki ek bachche ko jitna uske mata-pita samajhate hai, utana koi nahin samaj saktaa
 What is right and wrong for a child
 
 
 is baat kaa faisla maa-baap se behatar shaayad hi koi kar saktaa ho
 On the other hand, his mother and father are the first role models for almost every child
 parents kii choti se choti aadaten bhi bacchon par bahut gaharaa prabhaav daalati hai
 Imitation theory of psychology also proves that children learn social behavior from their parents
 vaise to parents kii ye bharsak koshish hoti he ki wo kuch bhi aisa na karen jiskaa bachche par galat asar ho lekin kai baar kuch aisi galtiyaan ho jaati hai or bachche unhen apane vyavhaar kaa hissaa bana lete hai
 In such a situation, these habits can prove to be harmful for them
 ye hai wo 7 baaten jinka har maa-baap ko khyaal rakhana chahie
 
 
 1
 kai baar ham apane luks or kariyar ko lekar khud kii aalochana karne lagate hai
 By doing this, you can do negative things about the beauty and success in the mind of the child
 jisaki vajah se aage chalakar use depressant or chidchidepan kii shikaayat ho sakati he
 2
 bahut se mata-pita ghanton phone par lage rahete hai
 Seeing them, their children also start demanding mobile at a very young age
 isse unki padhai par asar pad saktaa he
 3
 kai maa-baap kii yah aadat hoti he ki wo apane bacchon ko ladkaa yaa ladki hone ke anusaar vyavhaar karne ke liye kehete hai
 For example, if there is a girl, they are advised not to participate in sports and boys are advised to hide their feelings
 aisa karne se bacchon par nakaaratmak prabhaav padataa he
 4
 bacchon ke saamne kabhi bhi dhumrapaan na karen or na hi sharaab pien
 Doing this in front of children may make them feel that there is nothing wrong in smoking and drinking alcohol
 isse wo bahut kam umr main is gandi lat kaa shikaar ho sakate hai
 5
 apane bacchon kii tulana duusare bacchon se kabhi nahin kerani chahie
 Nor should you scold your children in front of other children for bringing down the number
 aisa karne se aapke bachche ke aatm-sammaan ko thes pahunch sakati he
 6
 agar aap apane bacchon ke saamne parivaar ke anya sadasyon ke saath ladate hai to iskaa un par bura asar pad saktaa he
 They may become very aggressive at this young age
 7
 Never hand over your children for small mistakes
 agar aap unhen choti- choti baton par sajaa dete hai to unamem virodh kii bhaavana ghar kar sakati he or ho saktaa he wo aapkaa sammaan karnaa bhi chhod den

 Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray's displeasure with bjp's prime ministerial candidate LK Advani became known when he did not mention BJP and Advani in his speech
 iske baad to adwani turant ja pahunche matoshri
 a videotape of Bala Saheb's speech was played at Shivaji Park in Mumbai

 Later, Advani told the media that he had a very good meeting with Bala Saheb
 laal krishna adwani ne samaj liya ishaara, or apane bhaashan ke baad turant ravaanaa ho gaye matoshri kii ore
 Though Advani called it a meeting of common courtesy, but this meeting did not mean much
 pichley kuch dinon se bijepi or shivasena ke bich rishte bahut achche nahin rahe hai
 This was also reflected in the rally held at Shivaji Park on Sunday
 shivasena pramukh bala sahab thakare khud to raily main hissaa nahin le paae lekin unke bhaashan kaa ek video tepe sabha main sunaaya gaya
 Balasaheb told the people that they no longer get out of the house
 ab uddhav ko hi unhone apana kaam saunp diya he or log unke liye hi vot karen
 Balasaheb also said that whoever the Prime Minister becomes, he is happy to remain the Shiv Sena chief
 is puure bhaashan main ek baar bhi naa to adwani kaa zikr tha or naa hi bijepi kaa
 Even though Bala Saheb did not take Advani's name, Bala Saheb came again and again in Advani's speech
 adwani ne apane bhaashan main kaha ki yahaan do bade netaa maujuud nahin hai ek to atal ji or duusare bala sahab ji
 Advani was trying his best to improve the relationship between BJP and Shiv Sena in view of elections
 darasal isse pichhali baar adwani bal thakare se nahin mil paae the
 Now in the rally too, Bala Saheb's displeasure became evident, then it became necessary to take blessings

 The story of the film 'lakshmi' is inspired by many true incidents, which are happening in this country indiscriminately
 'lakshmi' ek aaina he, samaaj kaa jahaan deh vyapaar ab bhi fal-phool rahaa he
 The story of the film revolves around a 14-year-old minor girl named Lakshmi, who lives in a small village in Hyderabad, whose father sold her to a woman for a few rupees
 us mahila ne munaafe ke liye use dalal ke haathon main saunp diya or phir lakshmi pahunch gai ek kothe par vahaan uske saath baar-baar balaatkaar hua, dheron julm hue magar vah ladki ek enjio kii sahaayta se sting oparation karwaakar unki kaid se nikalati he or pahunchati he adaalat tak
 Monali Thakur has played the character of 14-year-old Lakshmi
 kothe kii malkin ke role main shefali shah ne acha abhinay kiya he
 The film's director Nagesh Kukanoor is also cast in Dalal's role
 yah film nagesh kii style kii he, jisamen kahani kehane kaa tarika bada saral he
 The film was promoted by describing the battle of Lakshmi
 magar lakshmi kii ladaai kam or us par atyaachaar zyada dikhaaya gaya, jise ham kai baar parde par dekh chuke hai
 There is a lot of abusive language in the film and i think it is not necessary to use abusive language to make the film look real
 mujhe lagata he ki aisi filmon main agar itani gaaliyaan na hon to shaayad family audiyans bhi cinemagharon kaa rukh kar sakati he
 The film's title shows that Lakshmi's case was the first case in Andhra Pradesh in which the culprits were convicted
 lakshmi na sirf kahani he, deh vyapaar kii sachai kii balki ek saahsee ladki kii ladaai he, jo buland hokar deh vyapaar ke khilaaf apni aawaaj uthaati he
 Entertainment value in the film is negligible, but there is a message that shocks the society
 mere khyaal se sirf masala filmein hi nahin balki aisi filmein bhi banani chahie, jo samaaj ko ek disha de
 If any woman like Laxmi stands up to fight, then the purpose of making the film will be fulfilled
 is film teen stars

 This is betrayed by the confidence of the people of Delhi

 Under no circumstances will the trust of the public be broken

 '-input bhashaa Prashant Kishore while PK said
 haal ke saalon main hindustan kii siyasat kaa bada ranneetikaar
 Strategy-making face from behind the scenes
 jise vartmaan bhartiya chunavi paridrishy main chanakya tak kaha gaya
 Which played a decisive role in PM Modi's victory in the 2014 general election
 to uske ulat saal 2015 main piem modi or bijepi ke tamaam virodh ke baavjood nitish kumaar ko bihar kaa siem banane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Perhaps this is the reason why Rahul Gandhi, who is constantly lagging behind in India's politics, also turned to Prashant Kishore
 khud ko sabit karne ke liye prashanth bhi rahul or congress ke saath ho liye
 In the beginning, Prashant got the responsibility of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh
 siyaasi lihaaj se yah gambhir chunauti thi
 The Congress was out of power and decaying for 27 years in UP
 to vahiin punjab main aam aadmi party kaa majbootee se ladanaa or akaliyon se ladanaa ek nai chunauti thi
 PK also devised a strategy around Captain Amarinder in the wake of Punjab elections
 coffee vid captain or halke wich captain jaise program dizin kiye
 Slogans like Punjab da Captain, Captain da Punjab came
 yuvaaon ko rijhaane ke liye tamaam program or vaayade kiye gaye
 In Punjab, the claws won, defeating the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP with the Akalis
 aise main aam aadmi party kaa desh bhar main congress kaa vikalp banane kaa mansoobey paravaan nahin chadh sake
 PK was a hit in Punjab but UP disrupted Punjab's celebrations
 upi main pike chaaron khaane chitt ho gaye
 First Rahul's farmer journey from Deoria to Delhi
 shila dikshit ko siem kaa cheharaa project karnaa
 PK definitely started strongly with the new team
 ve is bich bijepi ko rokane ke naam par basapa se gathjod kii koshish main lage
 If the BSP was not ready, then tied up with the SP
 upi ko ye saath pasand he
 Started loud publicity with the slogan and theme of UP boy vs outsider Modi
 rahul or akhilesh nesajha press conferenceaur road sho kiye
 Key to success- MP Beach Dimple with slogans like Dimple Bhabhi also jumped in the campaign with rahul-akhilesh
 congress ke saath-saath sapa bhi dharaatal paraise main mana ja rahaa he ki sapa ke khilaaf satta virdohi lahar, non yadav kii sapa se naaraazgi or muslim tushtikaran ke tamge ne sapa ko jameen par laa pataka
 Despite all the efforts, PK could not understand this
 upi chunaavon main congress ko sirf 7 siten milin or yah unka sabase kharaab pradarshan he
 In view of the fragile situation in Uttarakhand, the Congress high command entrusted them with the responsibility there but they stayed there as well
 uttarakhand main bhi congress kaa pradarshan sabase kharaab rahaa
 Questions are also being raised within the Congress: After this defeat and victory, questions are also being raised within the Congress about Prashant Kishor
 punjab kii jeet kaa shrey dene ke bajaay upi kii badi haar kii vajah se ve sabake nishane par hai

 Nepal's Constituent Assembly on Monday rejected the proposal to declare Nepal a Hindu nation
 samvidhan sabha ne elaan kiya ki hindu bahul yah himalayan desh dharmanirpeksh bana rahegaa
 Violent protests started in protest of this decision of the Constituent Assembly
 jabaki sangheey dhaanche ko lekar halaat pehle se hi kharaab hai
 The proposal was made by the pro-hindu group Rashtriya Prajatantrik Party Nepal (RPP-N)
 jisamen samvidhan main sanshodhan ke jariye nepal kahindu raashtra kaa darjaphir se behaal karne kii baat kii gai thi
 More than two-thirds of the members in the 601-member Constituent Assembly rejected the proposal
 nepali samvidhan sabhaaki ore se samvidhan ke masaude ke anuchhedon par matdaan ke dauraan saansadon ne ghoshnaa kii ki nepal dharmanirpeksh bana rahegaa
 RPP-N President Kamal Thapa proposed an amendment to Article Four to demand the creation of Nepal Kohindu Rashtrapir
 party sutron ke anusaar nepal kehindu rashtrake taur par bahaali kaa prastaav thukraa diya gaya
 Because it did not get the required 10 percent votes
 samvidhan sabha ke adhyaksh subhash chandra ne prastaav ke thukraae jane kaa elaan kiya to thapa ne mat vibhaajan kii maang kii
 The 601-member Constituent Assembly got just 21 votes in favor of Thapa's proposal

 The committee is humiliated

 SP president Mulayam Singh Yadav, BSP and JD u member Jagdish Sharma also supported it and started shouting slogans
 sadsy cabinet kaa faisla waapas lene kii maang karte hue adhyaksh ke asana ke sameep aa gaye
 Chairman Meera Kumar asked the members to raise their point in zero hours and appealed to them to let the Question Hour run
 sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal ne bhi sadasyon se is vishay ko baad main uthaane ko kaha
 But it had no effect on the members
 shor sharaaba thamata nahin dekh adhyaksh mira kumaar ne sadan ko baithak dopaher 2 baje tak ke liye sthagit kar di
 It is worth noting that the Central Government today gave its approval to increase the basic salary of mps from three thousand rupees to 50 thousand rupees and doubled other allowances

 ashishnutaa par apane bayaan ko lekar chautarafa hamalaa jhel rahe abhinayta aamir khan par ab hindu mahasabha ne nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Acting National President of All India Hindu Mahasabha, Kamlesh Tiwari has said that actors like Aamir and Shah Rukh Khan, who have insulted the motherland, are traitors and such people should be killed
 tiwari ne kaha, 'is desh main aaj se pehle kitne narsanhaar hue par kabhi bhi kisi ne, chaahe wo hindu ho yaa musalmaan ho, ye nahin kaha ki ye desh hamaare rahane laayak nahin bachaa
 Abhishek such as Aamir Khan and Shahrukh Khan, who insulted the motherland by calling the country intolerant, are traitors
 inhen bharat chhod dena chahie or aise logon ko sar kalam kar saream chauraahey par lataka dena chahie
 The Hindu Mahasabha believes that calling the country intolerant is a conspiracy under which a lobby is deliberately maligning the country, so as to stop capital investment from abroad by tarnishing the image of India
 'daaud kaa paisa nahin lag rahaa, isliye he chintaa'mahasabha ke kaaryakari rashtriya adhyaksh ne kaha ki aajkal bollywood main daaud kaa paisa nahin lag paa rahaa he, isliye film industry pareshaan he
 He said, 'dawood's money is not available in films, so he is making such statements at the behest of Dawood and Pakistani agents
 aisa isliye ho rahaa he ki antarrashtriya str par bharat kii chhavi dhoomil ho sake or log yahaan nivesh karne se bachein
 This is a big conspiracy

 Their business has stopped in the country

 The Hindu Mahasabha clearly believes that there is nothing greater than the nation, and which India seems to be intolerant, it should leave here

 South Indian actor Dhanush, who started his career in Bollywood with the film 'ranjhana', has been described by an old couple as his real son
 court main arji daakhil karte hue unhone 65,000 rupee ke masik guzaara bhatta kii maang bhi kii he
 Let me tell you that a Tamil couple, r Katiresan and his wife Meenakshi, had claimed last year that Dhanush is their third son who ran away from home
 is babat unhone pichley saal november main melur district court main arji lagaai thi
 Katiresan has said in his petition that there is a possibility of erasing the identity mark of the actor
 unki yah daleel bhi yah he ki abhinayta kii ore se daayar janm praaanpatr vaastavik nahin he
 He made this argument on the basis that it does not mention the name and registration number of Dhunsh
 daawa karne vaale maa-pitaaar katiresan or unki patni minakshine daawa kiya tha ki ve dhanush ke biological mata-pita hai
 He claimed, referring to his son's school transfer certificate, that there is a mole near the right collarbone of the bow and a mark in the right arm
 is jode kaa kahana he ki dhanush asal main unka bete kalichevalan he jo saal 2002 main actor banane ke liye chennai bhaag gaya tha
 Who is the real mother and father of Dhanush? In this case, it has been said from the rainbow start that they have nothing to do with the couple who claim to be their parents
 dhanush kaa asli naam venkatesh prabhu he
 He is the son of Tamil film industry producer Kasturi Raja
 unki maa kaa naam vijayalakshmi he
 Rajinikanth's daughter is the husband of Aishwarya
 danpati kaa daawa tha ki dhanush bhaagane ke baad film nirdeshak kasturi raja ke paas gharelu naukar ke rup main kaam karne laga tha
 Significantly, the Kasturi king is considered the father of the rainbow
 danpati ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki film abhinayta ke rup main dhanush kii kamyaabi ke baad kasturi raja ke parivaar ne use bete ke rup main sweekaar kiya
 Dhanush was first discussed among the Hindi belt audience with his video Song Kolaveri Dee
 iske baad unhone sonam kapur ke saath film ranjhna se hindi cinema main kadam rakhaa
 After this film, Dhanush appeared in 'shamitabh' alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Akshara Haasan

 In such a situation it becomes imperative to consider their short biographies

 From Tollywood to Bollywood, he is famous as an action king
 rajnikant ne tamil film apurv raagangal se filmi kariyar kii shuruyaat kii
 Rajinikanth also gained a lot of fame in Hindi films
 unhone kai videshi filmon main bhi kaam kiya
 The special thing is that Rajinikanth is a Marathi, yet he earned a name by working in the languages of South India
 rajnikant ko film nallavanku nallavan ke liye best tamil actor kaa pehla filmphere award 1984 main mila
 After this, he was awarded with many big awards in the film world
 hindi filmon main mahatvapurn yogadan ke liye unhen saal 2000 main padmabhushan ke kitaab se nawaaza gaya

 His early life has been full of struggles

 He also became a successful filmmaker

 Through the backdrop of the court proceedings, look at some ground figures before saying anything on the film 'pink' that talks about women's independence
 neshnal krime records beuro (enciarabi) ke haalia aankadon ke mutabik, 2015 main desh kii adaalaton main mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh ke kul 12,27,187 cese trial ke liye aae
 Of these, only 1,28,240 (about 10 per cent) cases were completed
 isse bhi buree baat ki inamen sirf 27,844 maamalon main hi aparaadh sabit ho sakaa or 1,00,396 (yani kareeb 78 fisadi) maamle khaarij ho gaye or aaropee chhot gaye
 That is, the rate of conviction is just 22 percent
 jaahir he, desh kii adhiktar mahilaon ko na to pink kii tarah ek 'mahanayake' vakil naseeb ho paata he or na hi ek drishy main 'falak' kii baaten sun takreeban ro pade 'nyaayadhish'
 Yes, Pink is a good film or at least it is good in the tradition of most films made in Bollywood
 yah 'no' ke jis massej par jor detii he vah behad mahatvapurn he
 But there is some dramaticness in its proceedings
 film ke 'mahanayake' vakil ko dhyaan se dekhie jaraa
 How does he stare at the three young women? What is its message? Not only 'security' This means that the women are breaking some 'rules' or a 'circle' for their safety
 ab minal ke pita ko dekhie jaraa
 Instead of standing firm with his daughter, he walks out of the court 'in shame' and asks his friends to send Meenal to the house
 jahiratur par pink mahilaon kii aazaadee kii sabase ahm or shuruaati kadi 'parivaar' par baat nahin karti
 According to the NCRB, a total of 3,27,394 crimes were registered against women in 2015
 inamen sabase zyada maamle yani kareeb 38 fisadi ( kul 1,23,403) maamle pati yaa parijanon kii ore se kiye gaye atyaachaar ke maamle the
 Not only this, a total of 34,651 cases of rape were registered, of which 33,098 (95
 5 fisadi) main aaropee parichit the
 Clearly, family and relatives and neighborhood are the most important link in the case of crime against or against the freedom of women
 is lihaaj se'parced'behad ahm film he, jo paariwarik dhaanche par bhi baat karti he
 'parched' strikes only at the root of the exploitation of women, just like 'pink' does not remain confined to the surface or outside
 mujhe lagata he ki mahila aazaadee kaa masalaa buniyadi taur par saamaajik sweekaaryata se judaa he, yah mahaj adaalat masalaa bhar nahin he
 If 'pink' had taken the court verdict against the girls? (apparently, the ground figures of the country say so)
 In 'pink', the things that come out only in statements (like slogans) are the three heroines (one widow, one alleged infertile, one alleged prostitute) in 'parched'
 Implements are happening in life
 'parced' bhartiya samskruti ke 'mahaan' pariwarik dhaanche ke reshon ko udhed kar rakh detii he
 The characteristic of 'parched' in comparison to 'pink' is that the heroines (despite being the victims of exploitation in the beginning) finally make their own decisions, decide their own destiny
 vah kisi mahanayake yaa madadgaar yaa kisi adaalat ke faisle kii baat johne ko majaboor nahin rahati

 aisa bahut kam hota he jab insaanon ke liye or insaanon kii banaai adaalat main jaanwaron par mukadmaa chalata he
 If the trial is held in the Supreme Court, then the case becomes even more important
 aisa hi ek cese supreme court main aayaa
 Case T-24 aka Ustad
 us ustad kaa jisapar chaar insaanon ko maar kar baagh se aadamkhor ban jane kaa iljaam tha
 The court sentenced Ustad to life imprisonment, terming him a man-eater
 ye jab tak jinda rahegaa chidyaghar main hi rahegaa
 Ustad or the t-24 tiger named Ranthambore Park's most famous and biggest star, people used to come from far and wide just a year ago
 achaanak is par chaar insaanon kii jaan lene kaa iljaam lag gaya
 As soon as the allegations were made, the state government immediately removed Ustad from Ranthambore National Park and put it in the Sajjangarh Zoo, a hundred kilometers away
 ustad ke chaahane vaale uski is kaid ke khilaaf hoicourt pahunch gaye
 The High Court also asked to keep Ustad in captivity
 isi ke baad maamla desh kii sabase badi adaalat yani supreme court main pahunchaa
 Chief Justice of India Justice TS Thakur, Justice r Banumathi and Justice UU Lalit i
e
 the bench of three judges
 iske baad baqayada ustad kaa mukadmaa shuru hua
 Senior advocate Indira Jaising was appearing on behalf of Ustad's Khairakhwah
 donon taraf se jirah or tamaam daleelein di gayi
 Indira Jai singh argued that Ustad has just been seen standing near a human corpse
 insaan ko maarthe yaa use khate hue nahin
 That is, there is no evidence or eyewitness of this
 is par adaalat ne hairaangi jataate hue poocha ki kya iske liye aapako chashmadid chahie? kya ustad insaani laash ke paas khadaa hokar paharaa de rahaa tha? indira jai singh ne daleel di ki agar ustad ko jangal kii bajaae chidyaghar main kaid rakhaa gaya to wo biimaar pad saktaa he
 On this, the court said that if it is kept free in the jungle, it could threaten human life
 adaalat kovenyajeevvisheshgy ke hawaale se ye bhi bataaya gaya ki ustad ke chidyaghar main khan-paan kii aadaton or bartaav ko dekhte hue kaha ja saktaa he ki wo kaid main bhi normal or khush he
 In this connection, it was argued that if a tiger makes a mark with his hind legs while walking, the tail moves high, the neck is seen from the trees, standing on the branches of the tree, removing the bark of the tree from its front claws, wet soil
 Seated near and seen bathing in water, suppose that his behavior is normal
 ustad main philhal ye saare lakshan dekhne ko mil rahe hai
 After arguments and arguments by both sides, the Supreme Court, while delivering its verdict, ordered Ustad to be imprisoned in the Taumer Zoo
 hamaare apane samaaj, apane ghar, mohalle yaa gali main koi ajanabi ghus aae to ham kya karte hai? jaahir he ajanabi se khatra ho to ham pehle khud ko mahfuj karte hai or use khud se dur
 Does any law ever interrupt it? In the same way, strangers started coming to his house and neighborhood too
 lihaaja usne unpar hamalaa kar diya
 As a result, now he has been sentenced to life imprisonment by making him homeless from his own home

 Whereas the law made by humans, no person can be punished without denying the accused
 lekin yahaan to bagaiyr sunwaayee ke hi ranthambhore ke is raja ko hare pardon ke bich chidyaghar main kaid kar diya
 The country's highest court has not only declared him guilty of every four human deaths, but also sentenced to life imprisonment in this crime
 ranthambhore ke aaazaad maahaul se nikaal kar use udaipur ke sajjangadh biological park main kaid kar uske chaaron taraf hare rang kaa pardaa taang diya gaya he
 So that no one can see him nor can he see anyone
 darasal pichley saal 8 may ko ustad ne vanakarmi rampal saini par hamalaa kar use jaan se maar diya tha
 Rampal was posted at the forest post in Ranthambore for 10 years
 isi haadase ke baad hi rajya sarkaar ne ye faisla liya kiti-24ko ranthambhore neshnal park se hataa dena hi sahi he

 According to the organization, 'we are delighted that the BOE has listened to our concerns and has stopped issuing the new 20-pound note until further deliberations
 ' (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he

 However, he will discuss before bringing a new 20-pound note
 sanghathan ke anusaar, 'hamen khushi he ki bioi ne hamaari chintaaon ko suna or aagaamee vichaar-vimarsh tak 20 pound ke nae note ko jari karnaa roak diya he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 )(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) bollywood ke sultan salmaan khan ko parde ke baahar saat maheene main doosraa sabase bada tohfa mila he
 He was acquitted of all charges by the Bombay High Court seven months ago after running in a hit and run case for 13 years
 ab saat maheene baad rajasthan hai court ne bhi salmaan ko shikaar ke do maamalon main bari kar diya he
 Incidentally, in both these cases, the lower court had sentenced Salman to five years
 salmaan ko mila 'sabooton ke abhaav main shaq' kaa labhsaat maheene pehle bollywood ke sultansalmaan khanko bombai hai court se sabase badi raahat mili thi
 The court's decision to be acquitted of all the charges in the hit and run case ended Salman's 13 long years of running
 ab saat maheene baad aae salmaan kii jindagi ke duusare sabase bade adalati faisle ne salmaan or unke chaahane waalon ko ye bolne kaa mauka de diya he ki sultan shikari to hai par sirf sirf woox offis ke
 Salman was not present in the court to hear the verdict, however, Salman himself was not in the court to hear this important verdict
 wo mumbai main apane ghar par the, par sutron ke mutabik wo puri tarah se taiyaar the ki agar faisla unke haq main nahin aayaa, to vakeelon kii ek team usee vakt supreme court main jamaanat ke liye arji degi
 Even if needed, he will go to court and surrender himself
 phir vahaan se unhen jodhpur jail janaa padataa or jail main salmaan ke liye baqayada taiyaari bhi kar lee gai thi, lekin in sabaki naubat hi nahin ai, balki salmaan ke liye jodhpur se somvaar kii subah sirf or sirf raahat kii khabar ai
 Now there are 2 cases of dhabekantilal Thakur, Additional Advocate General, says that only two more cases are left on Salman's charge
 ek jodhpur ke hi kankani main ek or chinkaara ke shikaar kaa or doosraa isi shikaar ke silsile main armas act kaa
 Both these cases are currently pending in the sessions court
 ye faisla hona abhi baaki he ki salmaan doshi hai yaa nahin
 Apart from these two cases, now Salman Khan is free from every case
 ye hai rihaai kii vajahendrasal, hai court se salmaan khan kii rihaai kii kai vajahen raheen
 This was one of the reasons among them
 shikaar ke is puure maamle main 12 aaropee the, lekin seshans court ne salmaan ko chhod kar baaki 11 aropiyon ko reeha kar diya tha
 From there, the question arose whether Salman had hunted alone again? Salman himself drove a gypsy, lit the light for hunting himself and shot himself as well? Was it possible? The pellets from the gypsy and the bullets from Salman's room were different
 jis chaaku sehiran kaa galaa reta gayavah bahut chota thousase galaa nahin reta ja saktaa
 What is the whole matter? The story is 18 years old
 tab salmaan khan rajshri production kii film 'ham saath saath hai' kii shooting ke silsile main jodhpur main the
 He was accompanied by the rest of the film's actors Saif Ali Khan, Karisma Kapoor, Tabu and Sonali Bendre
 aarope he ki usee dauraan 26 sitambar 1998 kii raat salmaan khan jodhpur ke kareeb bhavaad ilaake main gypsy par shikaar ke liye nikalen or unhone ek kaale hiran kaa shikaar kiya
 a day later, on 28 September 1998, in the Horse Farm House area near Jodhpur, Salman was accused of hunting another black deer
 iske baad jodhpur ke hi kankani ilaake main salmaan ko teesri baar shikaar khilne kaa doshi tehraaya gaya
 This time also, the charge was to kill a deer
 yani salmaan par kul teen shikaar ke dauraan teen kaale hiran maarane ke iljaam lage
 In the third case, apart from hunting, a case of Arms Act was also imposed on him, because the license of the gun which was recovered from him was already expired
 1998 main hiraasat main liye gaye salmansalmaan ko 2 chinkaara shikaar maamle or ghoda farm house shikaar maamle main van vibhaag ne sabase pehle 12 oktober 1998 ko hiraasat main liya tha
 After this, Salman remained in police and judicial custody till 17 October 1998
 salmaan 10 april se 15 april 2006 tak jail main bhi rahe
 He has spent 18 days in Jodhpur Jail in cases of hunting of black deer
 seshan court ne jab unki sajaa kii pushti kii thi, tab unhen 26 agast se 31 agast 2007 tak jodhpur jail main rahanaa padaa tha
 Sessions court sentenced Salman to one-year sentence On 26 August 2007, the sessions court had convicted Salman for one year in the Bhavad area, while he was sentenced to five years in the horse farm house hunting case
 is sajaa ko kam maanate hue rajya sarkaar ne salmaan kii sajaa badhaane ke liye hai court main apil kii thi
 The amazing thing is that the Rajasthan government did not challenge the decision of the remaining 11 accused in the High Court in the High Court and the same thing went in favor of Salman in the High Court
 supreme court main ja saktaa he kesahaalanki, rajasthan sarkaar ke vakil kaa kahana he ki hai court ke is faisle ko wo supreme court main chunauti denge
 That is, this is not the final decision in this case
 mumbai ke hit and ran cese main bhi bombai hai court se bari hone ke baad maamla supreme court main pahunch gaya he
 That is, the last fight and the last hearing of the 13-year-old hit and run case and the old victim's case 18 years ago are now to be held in the Supreme Court

 When it comes to the relationship between India and Pakistan, the idea of cricket comes first
 kehane ko to yah khel he, lekin hameshaa ek virodh ke pratik yaa hathiyaar ke taur par istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Whenever the relationship between the two countries gets bitter, it becomes the first victim
 1965 ke yuddh ke baad se ab tak kai baar donon deshon kii tanatani kaa khamiyaja is khel ko bhugatna padaa he
 Cricket is as big an addiction for Indians as it is for Pakistanis
 cricket vahaan kaa sabase pasandida khel he or jab bharat-pakistan match hota he, to vah jaise ki unmaad main badal jaataa he
 Every match between the two is such that the time is stopped, the people are left holding their heart and by winning it seems as if the world has won
 phir aise main sawaal he ki donon ke rishton main kadavaapan kii bali yah kyon chadh jaataa he? bharat sarkaar aanan-fanan main cricket match hi kyon band karvaa detii he? hockey sahit duusare khel to chalate rahete hai
 Then why is this punishment given to Cricut? It is true that the army and ISI have played a big role in spoiling the relations between India and Pakistan
 in donon ke bharat virdohi rukh ke kaaran hi aaj itane varshon baad bhi donon padosi saamaanya jivan nahin bitaa paa rahe hai
 There is always a sound of enmity
 vahaan ke arajak or aatankwaadi tatv kashmir main khun-kharaba karte rahete hai
 Sometimes their soldiers also keep firing
 yani rishton ko behatar karne ke raste main kai tarah ke kaante hai
 The question is that if there are so many thorns in the way, then there will be ways to overcome them
 agar kaanton kaa muqabla karne ke liye rasta hi band kar diya jaae to yah kaisaa samaadhaan he?darasal bharat or pakistan ke jatil rishton ko saral banane ke liye jaruri he ki donon deshon ke log ek-duusare se adhik se adhik samvaad karen
 Cricket can be a powerful medium for this
 ise prishthbhumi main daalkar ham pakistan kii karatuuton par gussa to zaahir kar sakate hai, lekin koi thos samaadhaan nahin nikaal sakate
 It is better that we play with the spirit of the game and tell the people of Pakistan that we believe in improving the relationship
 ab pakistan chahta he ki donon desh cricket maichon kii siries shuru karen, to hamen aitraaj nahin hona chahie
 If we play with them, then there will be a dialogue between the people and the people, which will be good for both countries
 use alag rakhkar hamen kuch nahin hasil hoga, saath lekar chalane se kuch manzilen shaayad mil hi jaaen

 From the 42nd annual meeting of Reliance Industries, it became clear that in the coming decade, the company will be recognized as a big digital and retail company out of oil and gas
 company ne oil and gas (oil tu chemical) bijness main apni 20 fisadi hissedari (1 lakh karod rupye main) saudi company aramko ko bechney kaa faisla liya
 Also, it sold 49 per cent of the fuel retail business to British Petroleum in Europe (for Rs 7000 crore)
 company in saudon se mili raashi kaa bhugtan karj ko chukaane main kar sakati he kyonki company ne agle 18 maheene main karj mukt hone kaa bhi lakshya rakhaa he
 At present, the company has about 1 lakh 95 thousand crore debt
 salanaa baithak kaa bada hissaa jeeyo ke vistaar se judaa tha
 Chairman Mukesh Ambani made it clear that the investment cycle in Jio has been completed and fiber optics will be ready for use across the country in the next 12 months
 darasal fibre optics aane ke baad company kai aisi sevaayen ek saath lekar aegi jo gharon main apni pakad banane main bahut samay nahin lagaayengi
 For example, entertainment content (first day first show of a film, music, etc
), broadband with unlimited calling, DTH network, security appliances, video conferencing, etc
 mobile data ko nayaa oil bataa chuke mukesh ambani ab puri takat se jeeyo ko ghar-ghar pahunchaakar company kii badshahath ko barkaraar rakhana chahenge
 But here a big challenge will get the company as a customer
 tel or gas kshetra main kaarobaar karne par company ko kabhi ghar-ghar jaakar graahak nahin dhundne hote the
 But both retail and digital businesses rely solely on customer satisfaction and experience
 aakarshak ophers, saste tarriff ke bal par badi lonching to ho jaaegi lekin agar sevaayen behatar nahin huin to lambey samay tak tikna mushkil hoga
 One more screw, using internet of things or better consumption of content like film, music, without good connectivity in the phone is all worthless
 desh main 4ji kii sthiti kisi se chuphi nahin he
 In such a situation, how will all these services be able to survive beyond broadband because the limits of fast internet access through fiber optics will be at home and office only
 yani bahut kuch desh main 5ji ke bhavishya par tikaa he
 The future plans of Reliance showed investors Muttmayin
 yahi kaaran he ki agm ke baad mangalvaar ko girte bazaar main bhi reliance kaa share 10 fisadi se zyada uchhal gaya

 haryana ke yamunanagar main 60 saal ke ek vahashi darinde kii khaufnak karatuut kaa khulaasa hua he
 This hawk has made many innocent girls a victim of their lust
 iske upar gaanv ke sarkari skool main choti bacchiyon ko paise kaa laalach dekar shaareerik shoshan karne kaa aarope he
 The police have arrested him
 jaankaree ke mutabik, yamunanagar ke gaanv jadoda main ratif naamak yah shaks rahata he
 He was seen walking around a government school most of the time
 logon ko lagata tha ki is bujurg ko bacchon se zyada lagaav he, isliye yah unke paas rahata he
 But nobody knew what this hawan did
 pet main dard ke baad hua khulaasis maamle kaa khulaasa tab hua, jab skool main ek choti bacchee ke pet main dard shuru hua
 After that, everyone was stunned to hear what he said
 maasoom ne bataaya ki vah haivaan bacchiyon ko paise kaa laalach dekar apane paas bulaata, phir unhen ekant main le jaakar unke saath ashleelata karata tha
 According to school teacher Manjit Kaur, the ground slipped under her feet after hearing the story of the girl
 bacchee is kadar sadame main he ki vah us darinde ko dekhakar thar-thar kaanpane lagati he
 Can't even speak properly us darinde ne ab tak kareeb saat masuumon ko apni havas kaa shikaar banaaya he
 Manjit Kaur filed a case under the POSCO Act and informed the police about the incident
 iske baad dspi rajendra kumaar ne police ko turant karrwai kaa aadesh diya

 Every fifth day in India, a sweeper makes a call

 That unfortunate human being doing manual scavenging makes headlines when he dies due to suffocation or accident in the sewer
 par kisi adhikari kii jabaan se yah nahin nikalataa ki ''yah hamaari samasya he; ham iskaa samaadhaan karenge
 "new technological tools are welcome
" kitna acha ho ki ye amanviya kaam safai karmchaariyon kii bajaae mashine karne lagen
 But technology solution is not a solution to the problem because basically it is not a technology but a social problem and then administrative
 safaikarmi valmiki jaisi jatiyon se hai jo sadiyon se haath se mailaa dhote aa rahe hai or chuaachhut kaa shikaar rahe hai
 Taking birth in this caste is similar to a curse
 yah janmajaat jati anyaay ke khilaaf khadey hone kii aapaki kshamta ko pangu kar detii he
 His beds are so strong that even after getting rid of this work, the legs are still fastened
 ve bhedbhaav se bachane ke liye apni patniyon se bhi pahchaan chhipate hai
 Can you imagine the needlessness to hide the identity of your caste that cannot face the truth in intimate relationships? Which technology, which app, which advertising campaign can fix it? Laws passed in 1993 and 2013 prohibit manual scavenging
 phir use lagu kyon nahin kiya gaya? supreme court ne siver kii safai main marane vaale har ek karmchaaree ke parivaar ko 10 lakh ru
 Has ordered compensation
 phir bhi sirf 2 pratishat hi iskaa laabh uthaa sake hai
 According to our report, in the last 10-15 years, about 1,870 sanitation workers died while cleaning the sewer
 kai maamle to saamne bhi nahin aae
 In his book Karmayog, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has considered manual scavenging as a 'spiritual experience'
 meraa unase nivedan he ki ve haath se mailaa saaf karne vaale kisi vyakti se vyaktigat rup se puuchhen ki kya dusron ke mel saaf karne ke dauraan use palabar ke liye bhi aadhyatmik anubhav hota he, yaa rojaanaa kaam par nikalnaa kya uske liye tirthayatra jaisaa he? darasal, inke paas koi or chaara bhi nahin, kyonki in jatiyon main janme logon ke liye koi vaikalpik rojgaar maujuud nahin he
 By doing such 'spiritual' recollection, the government commits itself in allocating funds for the rehabilitation of these people
 agar koi chota kosh aavantit hota bhi he to vah sarkari vibhaagon kii bandarbaant or samitiyon or surveykshanon ke naam par uda diya jaataa he
 Of course, the surveyed government employees get employment, but not only in whose name the funds are released
 yahi sarkaar swatchta abhiyaan ke tahat shauchalayon ke nirmaan ke liye 2 lakh karod rupye aavantit karti he
 Most of these toilets are pits or septic tanks — 50 million toilets means 5 million pits
 inhen koun saaf karegaa? valmiki log, or koun? media kii surkhiyon main jagamag dikh rahaa svachh bharat abhiyaan aisi tasviir pesh karata he maano sabhi bhartiya saaf-safai kii is nai lahar main mil-julkar haath banta rahe hai
 But just let us know the previous details about the caste of the dying sanitation workers
 sarkari task force ke haal ke anumaan ke anusaar, desh main haath se mailaa saaf karne waalon kii sankchaya 53,000 he
 But this estimate is based on a survey of only 121 districts out of 640 districts
 isamen kuch galat he
 We estimate that they number around 150,000
 sarkaar ke baad isaki jimmedaari samaaj kii he
 We need to explore caste discrimination, how deep or wide its roots are
 na to samaaj hamaara dushman he, na rajya
 We oppose social discrimination disguised as government policies and tradition
 aaj sthitiyaan badal gai hai
 There is bitterness in the society
 pehle jab hamane dry latrin ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaaya to jin logon ne asuvidhaayen jhelin, unhone bhi hamaare khilaaf gussa nahin dikhaaya tha, balki hamen samajha ki ham kya or kyon kar rahe hai
 We could discuss our differences by drinking tea
 lekin aaj halaat vaise nahin
 The actual spiritual experience will come alive only when manual scavenging is over
 un bebas pariwaron ko sammanit rojgaar dilaane kii pahal honi chahie jo jinda rahane ke liye is kaam ko karne ke liye majaboor hai

 Adam Gondvi, who always rebelled against the evils prevailing in the society and bureaucracy by becoming the voice of the oppressed and the weak, made the Hindi ghazal out of the circle of romanticism and made people oriented and waged a fierce battle against every evil
 18 disambar ko unki punyatithi he
 Highlighting the adorable mood of Ramnath Singh alias Adam Gondvi, the famous poet Anwar Jalalpari said that the creators of the evils prevailing in the society and the feudal oppression of the post-independence society and the feudal oppression by which Gondavi wrote his writings are rarely found
 unhone bataaya ki gondvi kaa lahaza ‘inkulab jindabad’ se aage nikal kar baghawat kaa lahaza ban chukaa tha
 When he used to tell his rebellious lion full of emotion, it felt as if he could just change the whole system in an instant and put all the corrupt people behind bars
 magar unke kamjor halaat ne unhen sirf shaayari tak simit rakhaa
 Jalalpuri said that his poetry of Gondvi has been handed over like a weapon in the hands of weak, poor and exploited people
 vah samaaj main badlaav nahin laa sake lekin unki shaayari kii yah khubi he ki vyavastha ko parivartit karne vaale log unki shaayari kaa ek muddat tak istemaal karte rahenge
 He said that Gondvi has truly done the work of pushing the efforts of Dushyant Kumar in the direction of making Hindi Ghazal as romantic and social sensitive
 jalalpuri ne kaha ki behad kam padhe likhe hone ke baavjood adam gondvi ne apni rachanaaon main jin upmey or upmaanon kaa prayog kiya he vah unki soch or jaankaree par daanton tale anguli dabaane kaa majdoor karata he
 Born on October 22, 1948, in the village of Atta in Gonda district, Ramnath Singh, born in an ordinary farmer family, spent a lot of childhood
 paariwarik prishthbhumi kamjor hone ke kaaran keval primary tak shiksha paane ke baad unhone padhai chhod di or kheti kisaani main lag gayi
 From his childhood, he became inclined towards poetry and he started going to nearby Mushayars and Kavi Sammelan
 assi kaa dashak aate-aate vah hindustan ke kavi manchon par pahachaane jane lage
 According to Jalalpuri, the poetry of Adam is a poem of social injustice and inequality
 vah hamen vahaan khinch le jaati he, jahaan khadey hokar ham apni vyavastha kii syah sachaai ko dekhakar usase garibon ko hone vaali takalif kii shiddat kaa ehsaas kar sakate he
 Gondvi's last time was spent in hospitals

 com / n451exepzj — ANI UP (@aninewsup) July 27, 2018 Why is there a lunar eclipse? The simple answer is that the lunar eclipse
 us sthiti main surya ek taraf, chandramaa duusari taraf or prithvi bich main hoti he
 a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon comes out of the Earth's shadow
 chandragrahan poornima ke din hi padataa hechandragrahan poornima ke din padataa he lekin har poornima ko chandra grahan nahin padataa he
 The reason for this is that the Moon's orbit is bent on the Earth's orbit
 yah jhukaav takreeban 5 degree he isliye har baar chandramaa prithvi kii chaaya main pravesh nahin karata
 It escapes from the top or bottom
 yahi baat suryagrahan ke liye bhi sach he
 Solar eclipses are always on the new moon day because the size of the moon is about 4 times less than the size of the earth
 isaki chaaya prithvi par choti aakaar kii padati he isiilie purnataa kii sthiti main surya grahan prithvi ke ek chote se hisse se hi dekha ja saktaa he
 But in the event of a lunar eclipse, the Earth's shadow is much larger than that of the Moon
 lihaaja isse guzarane main chandramaa ko zyada vakt lagata he
