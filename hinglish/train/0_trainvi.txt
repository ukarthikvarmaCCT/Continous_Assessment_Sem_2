 Among Hindus, every day of the week is dedicated to some deva
 har din kisi ek devtaa yaa bhagwaan ke pujan ko mahatv diya jaataa he
 Similarly, Saturday is also a day
 lekin is din par kuch bhakton ko ek baat par thodi si kanfusion hoti he
 That is that some people celebrate this day in the name of Shani Dev, while some consider it to be Hanuman's war
 aakhir yah waar kis devtaa ke naam par he
 Whom to worship on this day is right according to Hinduism
 yah ham bataate hai aapako ki hindu manyataon main shani or hanuman kii kin samaantaaon ke chalate is din donon kii puja sambhav maani jaati he- According to the belief, Sri Hanuman is an avatar of Rudra and Shani Dev is a name Rudra, due to the similarity between the two gods, both are worshiped on this day
 shanivaar ke din ko donon hi devataaon ko poojana hindu dharm ke anrtgat sahi he
 Actually according to Surya Samhita, Hanumanji was born on Saturday
 isliye is din unka pujan bhi galat nahin he
 Saturn's father is Sun
 or manyata ke anusaar surya hi hanuman ke guru hai
 All of them believe that Shani Dev had estrangement with his father
 lekin surya ne hanuman ko apane tej kaa ansh diya tha
 Apart from this, both can be considered as part of the Sun
 agar hanumansahastranam ko dekha jaae to usame hindu dev hanuman kaa ek naam shani bhi diya gaya he
 Therefore, worship of both of them is considered valid on this day

 Youthful players have gathered at the decorated cricket ground of Government Higher Secondary School, Handwara in North Kashmir
 kabhi naeem kaadir bhat in khilaadiyon kaa ustad tha
 But today they have not gathered for cricket

 On 12 April, the army opened fire on a group of people protesting in this town of North Kashmir and a stray bullet hit Naeem
 naeem kii maut us hinsa kaa nateeja thi, jo in apusht afvaahon ke baad foot padi thi ki ek faujee ne 15 saal kii ek ladki ke saath chhedchhad kii thi
 This undeserved death has exposed some disturbing facts of the valley
 unamem sabase ahm hakeekat yah he ki kashmiri naujavaanon kii ek puri peedi main algaav badhata ja rahaa he
 They feel disconnected from the rest of the country, fanaticism is building up in them and the long-simmering anger and resentment within them against what they consider to be a "heartless Indian state" is fast approaching
 gulam rasul pandit (56 varsh)dakshin kashmir ke krimabad gaanv ke pandit kehete hai ki unki ankhon main ab aansu bhi nahin bache hai
 His 28-year-old son Naseer was a constable in the Jammu and Kashmir Police
 magar 2015 main hijbul mujahidin main shaamil hone ke liye do eke-47 riflein lekar bhaag gaya
 He was shot dead in an encounter on 7 April outside the Wehill village of Shopian
 pita apane bete ke janaaje main bhi nahin gaye
 After the April 12 Handwara incident, fresh disturbances started in the entire valley
 mahaj 15 kimi dur kupwada ke natsuna gaanv main virodh pradarshan kar rahe naujavaanon par sena ke goli chalaane se ek naagarik maaraa gaya
 Another student lost his life in the village of Dragumula, when a tear gas ball thrown at the hands of the police went straight from his head

 The rise of violent protests in the valley points to a reality involving young Kashmiris under 25 years of age
 ye kashmiri noujvaan phogiyon kii thakaan, achaanak hone vaali jaanch-padataalon or kalashnikovon kii rosemara kii khuraaq par paley-bade hai, or ab apana haq jataane lage hai
 Believing that only "freedom" can give them the normal conditions for which they are longing
 suraksha balon kaa kahana he ki yah ubhaar mote taur par sthaneey bashindon kaa he, jise soshal networkon ke jariye seemaa paar pakistan se hijbul mujahidin (echem) or lashkar-e-taiyaba (eliti) sareekhe ugravadi sanghathanon kaa samarthan mil rahaa he
 But there is still no answer to the question of how spontaneous or spontaneous this movement was born
 jammu-kashmir ke kuch varisht police afasar maanate hai ki pathar phenkane kii ye ghatnaayen zyada gahari ugravadi sajeesh kaa hissaa hai
 Especially at a time when security personnel are directly involved in encounters with militants
 gulam kaadir daar (70 varsh)daar ne apane bete shaukat ahamed ko pyaar se “mirchi seth” naam diya tha, jab pulavama main 2014 main usne mahaj 16 baras kii umr main apane walid kaa masaalon kaa bahut chota-sa kaarobaar khud aage badhkar sambhaal liya tha
 Dar says his son was tortured twice in police custody
 uske baad vah bhagkar jeiem main shaamil ho gaya
 It was more than a year when Shaukat was killed by police bullets in Rajpora town

 His videos with a megaphone in hand went viral on youtube
 ek police afasar ne india today se kaha, “jin bade hamalon se duniya kaa dhyaan khinchaa ja saktaa he, unke liye jaruri hathiyaar, gola-barood or ladaake to hai nahin
 In such a situation, militant gangsters are provoking conflicts between local people and security forces
 ye takaraav zyada lambey vakt tak chalate hai or zyada logon kii najaron main aate hai, banisbat us golibari ke, jo dur-daraaj ke kisi kashmiri gaanv main sadak kinare hoti he
 The political uncertainty that arose after the death of former Chief Minister and PDP chief Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, and the three months of free time left till his daughter Mehbooba Mufti took over the reins on April 4, also added fuel to the fire
 rajya kii arthvyavastha chaupat or berogari kaabo se baahar he

 The special package of that will be implemented by Prime Minister Modi announced last November
 iske alaava unhen vah sab karnaa hoga, jo logon ko unke paale main waapas laa sake
 Of particular concern to the security forces and the state administration is that this strip of kupwara-handwara is the last place where they expected violent demonstrations
 haalanki yah ab bhi un jagahon main se he, jahaan se niyantran rekha paar karke dabe paanv aane vaale ugravadi ghuspaith karte rahe hai
 Yet the area has been largely quiet for more than a decade
 teritorial army main bhartee ke saath-saath yahaan ke kai logon ko haal ke varshon main niyantran rekha ke najadik sainya thikaanon par kuliyon or mazdooron ke taur par rojgaar miltaa rahaa he, jisase ilaake ke bascindia suraksha balon ke saath kareeb se jude bhi hai
 The jamaat-e-islami (JEI) and Hurriyat radicals have not been able to infiltrate the separatist area and a large number of people voted in the recent elections

 He says, "my son was trained in computer engineering
" agar uske paas naukari hoti to aaj vah jinda ho saktaa tha
 "but recent events seem to have started a sudden reversal of all this
 19 april ko virodh pradarshnon ke baad pradarshnakariyon ne kasbe ke bichobich sthapit sena ke teen banksron ko dhaha diya
 They were protesting against the week-long curfew imposed in the town after Naeem's death
 pados ke langate vidhansabha kshetra ke nirdaleey vidhayak ejeeniyar raashid kehete hai, “sena ke khilaaf bheetar hi bheetar gussa tha, jo jaraa-se uksaave par badla lene par utaaru ho jaati he
 "the army and its bunkers are no longer visible, but the local residents who witnessed the violence of April 12 express their displeasure

 "he tells us that when he passed by the army camp while going to his house in Bhagatpura, a residential area of handwara, he used to crawl very slowly every day and keep his motorbike's headlight off

 vah kahata he, “aapane rukne kii galati kii nahin ki aapako kai ghanton ke liye pakad liya jaataa tha
 If you were lucky, then you could have escaped from the abuses given in Hindi and without killing them
 ”handwara ke shant hone ke bamushkil 10 din baad 28 april ko kupwada kii lolab ghati main sandigdh eliti ugravadiyon or suraksha balon ke bich golibari ho rahi thi
 Just then, scores of people were threatened from the surrounding villages
 ve apane gharon se nikal aae or police or sena ke javaanon par pathar barasaane lage
 Eventually he was forced to stop his action
 jaise hi yah virodh pradarshan shuru hua, muthbhed main ghayal ugravadi bhaag niklaa
 His body was found the next day at some distance
 is kism kii choti-moti bagawatein ghati main rosemara kii baat ho gai hai
 Nearly every long-running encounter in south Kashmir has faced a stone-throwing mob in recent months

 An army officer admits, "today we are on the backfoot

 He roars and says, "we are safe only because of the Mujahideen (militants)
" ve insaaf kii jang, meri jang lard rahe hai or isliye yah ham sabakaa ferj he ki suraksha balon ke hamalon se unki hifaazat karen

 He suddenly jumps into the conversation: “we do not want to go with India, Pakistan or China

 We want freedom! " If you add a few letters, the same sound is heard in the four districts of South Kashmir - Pulwama, Shopian, Kulgam and Anantnag
 4 april ko mukhyamantri kii shapath lene se pehle tak mahabuuba mukrati loksabhaa main isi ilaake kii numaaindgi karti thim
 The feeling of isolation as well as the rise of religious fundamentalism around the world has ignited a fire of discontent
 ek police afasar kehete hai, “ghati kaa saamaajik maahaul 1980 ke dashak ke nakshekadam par badaae laga he
 At that time, the rise of militancy was greatly provoked by the Ziaul Haq government of Pakistan
 aaj algaav kii bhaavana ke saath yuva dimaagon kaa kattarta kii taraf rujhaan bad gaya he, jise duniya bhar main internet par chal rahi jehad kii baton se shah mil rahi he
 After 2014, the changed social-political plank of India is also playing its part
 dharna yah he ki narendra modi ke ubhaar ko lekar ghati phikrmand thi, jinhen hindutv ke samarthak ke taur par dekha gaya tha
 This perception was further strengthened when the PDP formed an alliance with the BJP after the 2014 assembly elections
 yahaan tak ki ghati ke baahar kii ghatnaon ne bhi kattarpanthi maansikta ko majboot karne kaa kaam kiya he
 These included incidents of beating up a man over beef in Dadri village of UP, beating of JNU Students Union President Kanhaiya Kumar in Patiala House Court in Delhi and the "bharat Mata" campaign
 inase jamaat or hurriyat se jude kai yuvaaon samet noujvaan puri tarah mutmain ho gaye ki unki kashmiri pahchaan or islam khatre main hai
 During the last few months, there has been evidence of the re-emergence of the flourishing Hizbul Mujahideen in Kashmir itself
 sanghathan ke aankade teji se bad rahe hai
 This is the highest among 72 new militants recruited in the Valley in 2015
 2016 ke shuruaati teen maheenon main 23 nae ugravadi isamen bhartee hue
 Between January and April this year, the organization was involved in almost as many violent incidents as the let, which is essentially an organization of Pakistani militants, on the basis of a network of on-the-ground activists and a sympathetic local population
 
 ek baat jo ghati ko apane lahooluhaan or abhishpt ateet main waapas dhakele jane se roak rahi he, vah he 740 kimi lambii niyantran rekha se laga sena kaa majboot ghuspaith virdohi jaal yaa counter infiltreshan grid
 This trap has completely closed most of the infiltration targets in India
 pehle hathiyaar or visphotakon kii taskari ke liye bhi inhen thikaanon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 The withdrawal of logistics means that militants, especially the Hizb, have been forced to snatch arms and ammunition from "weak targets" like railway police patrols and lone policemen
 pulavama ke police afasar kehete hai, “unki hataasha is baat se jaahir he ki ugravadiyon ne chote-mote chaakuon or yahaan tak ki pisi mirchi ke bharose chhinjhapat kii vaardaaton ko anjaam diya he
 Mehbooba Mufti is still searching for her support in the government
 haal hi main unhone un travel adwijuri par nae sire se vichaar karne ke liye ek baithak bulaai, jo kai europea deshon ne jammu-kashmir aane vaale apane sailaaniyon ke liye jari kii hai
 Mehbooba said that it is unfair to compare his state with those areas which are involved in the battles, where the number of bloodshed is more
 magar ve jo bhi kahen, is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki kashmir aman-chaiyn se dur he
 The link between government and local residents has been fragile even in the best of times
 lekin ab to uske or bikharane kaa andeshaa he
 Is the advisory and quarrel necessary to calm the seething land that Mehbooba is ruling today? It can only be said that winning the hearts and minds was difficult even in the best of times and who can cherish this responsibility lying on the shoulders of Mehbooba
 porbandar main boat se ghuspaith kii koshish 26 / 11 jaisaa aatanki hamalaa dohraane keepakistani sena kii sajeesh he
 The people aboard the boat from Pakistan were in constant contact with the people sitting in Karachi and Thailand

 supreme court ne in muthbhedon par bhi sawaal uthaae hai or agar sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh diya jaataa he, to upi ke siem or sheersh police adhikariyon ko pareshaani hogi

 The Supreme Court has questioned the encounters

 However, it has never been easier for the opposition party to defeat any Chief Minister in his stronghold
 iske baavjood ummid to rahati hi he ki koi karishma ho jaae
 There are few such instances in political history when the strong faces of the opposition party beat the then chief ministers by making a dent in their fort
 madhyapradesh main 1962 main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri kailashnath katju ko jansangh ke lakshminarayan jamanalaal ne 1542 vot se haraaya tha

 budhani vidhansabha main obisi nirnaayak hai, congress kii ranneeti he ki shivaraj singh ko zyada se zyada samay tak budhani seat par uljhaakar rakhaa jaae
 Arun's political stature will increase even if he loses in front of Shivraj, he will have a natural claim to the Chief Minister's chair if he wins
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apane bhaashan main isaki taraf ishaara bhi diya, jab unhone manch se kaha, 'ye madhyapradesh ke future hai, maine arun se kaha ki tumhen shivaraj ke khilaaf ladanaa he, usne ek minute kii deree nahin lagaai or kaha main harkar nahin haraakar aauungaa
 With Arun Yadav coming to the ground, it is certain that Shivraj Singh will not get a walkover from the opposition as before, although the popularity of the Chief Minister and BJP in the area is also not less

 vahiin centre sarkaar ne court main kaha ki in niyamon ko lekar rajya sarkaron se kai suzav or aapatti jataai he, jin par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The Central Government is not currently implementing the rules and it will take about three months to make changes in them
 iske baad centre sarkaar niyamon main badlaav kar dobaaraa notification jari karegi

 Questions are being raised again about the inclusion of Ishant Sharma in Team India's most experienced fast bowlers
 unke haaliye pradarshan ko dekhte hue unhen team main shaamil kiye rahanaa kisi abujh paheli se kam nahin he
 It is not that Team India does not have the option of fast bowlers, how long do the selectors want to bet on Ishant? The T20, ODI and Test three have failed in the format in the last few months
 unhen form main dekhe hue jamaana ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, he has become a burden for the team
 world cap main bhiishanth timme chune jate lekin chotil hone ke naate team se baahar ho gaye
 Ishant took just one wicket in four matches for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League
 jabaki ran lutaaney main wo kaaphi aage rahe
 For a long time he has not been seen bowling with a good line and length
 agar ipel kii baat karen to ashish nehra kaa pradarshan dekhte hue eshanth kii jagah unhen shaamil kiya ja saktaa tha

 Even in the smallest format of 'failed' cricket in T20, Ishant could not do anything special
 ipel main unhone chaar maichon main 159 ran lutaakar mahaj ek wicket liya
 In his last match played against Kings XI Punjab, Ishant Sharma looted 49 runs alone
 vahiin international tii-20 match kii baat karen to unhone oktober 2013 main bharat ke liye aakhri tii-20 match khelaa tha
 In International T20 matches, Ishant has taken 8 wickets in 14 matches
 is dauraan unhone 8
 Has scored runs at an economy rate of 63
 ab baat test cricket kiishanth ne pichley paanch test match videshi jameen par khele hai jo tej gendbaajon kii madadgaar hoti hai
 He took 7 wickets in a match against England in the Lord's Test in July 2014, while he took 6 wickets in the December 2014 Brisbane Test against Australia
 iske alaava ek match main 4, ek main 2 or ek main ek wicket unke naam rahe
 Ishant will have to bring some new arrows in his quiver to stay in the team
 unki gendbaaji main ab dhar najar nahin aati
 At the moment, selector Ishant is seen to be kind but if he does not improve his bowling then the time is not far when he will be shown the way out of the team

 Bollywood's upcoming film 'family of Thakurganj' has just a few days left to release
 lekin film se judaa ek vakya ab saamne aayaa he
 Some time ago during the shooting, there was a dispute between the actor and the writer on the film's set
 yah vivaad itnaa bad gaya ki'family of thakurganj' (family of Thakurganj) ke actor saurabh shukla (saurabh Shukla) ne khud ko kareeb 4 ghanton ke liye venity vine main band kar liya tha
 According to the inside reports, there was an argument between actor Saurabh Shukla and the writer of the film Dilip Shukla about a scene

 Angered by this, he left in his vanity van
 dakhal andaaji se naaraaz hokar gaye saurabh shukla (saurabh Shukla) ko venity vine main kaaphi der ho gai, lekin vah vahaan se baahar nahin nikle
 After four to five hours had passed, the production team itself convinced Saurabh Shukla and brought him out for the shoot
 haalanki is bahes ke bare main film produsar ne kuch bhi bataane se saaf inkaar kar diya

 (input bhashaa se) Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has installed two dozen policemen in the security of the trees at the CM residence amidst the law and order situation in Bihar

 In fact, there are many mango and lychee trees, as well as many vegetables have been sown in the CM residence at 1 Anne Marg
 yah ghar purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne ab tak khaali nahin kiya he
 Therefore, Nitish Kumar has deployed an army of policemen here so that Manjhi's family cannot break fruits and vegetables

 In an interview to India Today, Raghuram Rajan emphasized that 'make for India' should not only be 'make for India'

 On the other hand, only about 10 thousand crores was earned from tax
 vahiin unhone kaha arabiai ke paas note print karne kaa adhikaar isliye he kyonki agar sarkaar khud apane paise print karne lage to bharat bhi zimbabwe ban saktaa he
 This is the reason why an independent institution like RBI is needed
 notebandi ke liye koi taarikh nahin milirajan ne yah bhi kaha ki notebandi ke liye sarkaar ko arabiai ke parmishan kii jarurat nahin thi
 Also no date for demonetisation was found
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ko notebandi kii aarthik chunautiyon ke bare main pehle hi aagaah kar diya gaya tha or unka purvanumaan sach hua
 Ready to return, Rajan said that he did not resign, his term was over
 rajan ne bataaya ki vah aage kaam karne ke liye taiyaar the
 Also told that there is a lot of work left

 Rajan expressed his intention that he would like to return again

 haalanki rajan ne kaha ki pichley kuch saalon main is vyavastha main sudhaar aayaa he or diwaliyapan par nae bill ke lagu hone ke baad isamen or sudhaar aayega
 At the same time, he also talked about making strong laws, according to him, there are old laws, which put pressure on the small borrowers, but the big borrowers escape due to the army of their lawyers
 haalanki aisa bhi nahin ho ki kade kanoon kii vajah se har taraf dar kaa maahaul ho or aarthik halaat kharaab ho jaaen

 He said that his biggest emphasis would be on the development of infrastructure
 infrastracchar hi behatar economi kii chaabi he
 Rajan also said that there is a need for better power management in India
 na sirf ham kam power janareshan kar rahe hai, balki distribution main bhi sudhaar kii jarurat he
 According to Rajan, the government should also emphasize on increasing imports
 na sirf mek in india ho balki mek for india bhi ho
 The government should focus on export promotion
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne april main us baat kaa zikr kiya jisase ve pad sanbhaalane ke baad pichley 11 maah se bachate aa rahe the
 He mentioned Mukesh Ambani's name twice
 pehali baar, khud ko desh ke sabase bade or sabase prabhaavshaalee udyogpati se dur bataane ke liye or duusari baar, apni sarkaar or aam aadmi main kathith khai ko bharne ke liye
 In his interview on 8 April, he said that red tape will not work for both Mukesh Ambani and the common man
 19 april ko party ke saansadon ko sambodhit karte samay unhone bhoomi adhigrahan adhyadesh kaa bachaav karte hue kaha, "vahaan (kisaanon se lee gai jameen par) koun rahegaa
 Will Mukesh Ambani be there? ”it was the first time since Modi was sworn in as India's 15th Prime Minister on May 26 last year when Modi was becoming a part of the game prepared by others
 is tarah yah is baat kaa aakhri saboot tha ki vipaksh, jo bijepi ke netritv vaali centre sarkaar ko korporate kii hitaishi or garibon kii virdohi bataane kii koshish main lagaataar hamalaa bolte hue ekajute ho gaya tha, phir se khel main vaapasi kar chukaa tha
 All the main opposition parties, except Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress and Jayalalithaa's AIADMK, were silent for nearly six months after witnessing a bitter defeat in the last summer general election
 vipaksh kii vapasivipakshi partiyon ke ekajute hone kii shuruyaat pichley saal disambar main hui jab sarkaar bhoomi adhigrahan adhyadesh lekar ai
 After this, the government received another setback when the Aam Aadmi Party trounced the BJP in the Delhi assembly elections held in February this year
 phir march ke maheene main samay kaa pahiyaa ghoomane kii shuruyaat hui jab congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke netritv main 14 partiyon ne raashtrapati bhawan tak march kiya or bhoomi adhyadesh ke khilaaf gyaapan saunpa
 And on April 19, the government faced the strongest opposition ever from the opposition when Rahul, who came aggressively after returning from a 56-day leave, held a massive rally of farmers to gain support against the ordinance in Delhi
 Addressed
 purv kendriya mantri jairam ramesh kehete hai, "vipakshi partiyon ko ek saath laane main bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak ne utprerak kaa kaam kiya
 "restriction on mistakesbjp is now trying to correct its mistakes
 yah jaanate hue ki vipaksh kii ekta bhoomi adhigrahan bill ke irdagird hi gum rahi he, modi ne mamata banerjee or jayalalita se achche sambandh banane kii bharpoor koshishen kii hai
 On May 9, she launched three social security schemes from Kolkata in Mamata's presence, and spoke to Jayalalithaa over the phone just two days after she was acquitted on disproportionate assets
 modi ke liye samasya yah he ki yah prembhav aage bhi barkaraar rahegaa
 Sometimes, Mamta and Jayalalithaa, who have a history of getting caught up with the UPA, cannot be taken lightly
 or aise main to bilkul bhi nahin, jab pashchim bengal main agle saal chunaav hone vaale hai
 There the Muslims constitute 20% of the total voters and TMC has a strong support base
 modi ko bihar kii ore se bhi jhatka lag saktaa he, jahaan janata parivaar kii partiyaan—janata dal (united), lalu prasad kaa rashtriya janata dal or mulaayam singh yadav kii samaajawaadee party—phir se ek ho rahi hai
 If the Janata Parivar managed to unite and gave a tough tone to the Bihar assembly elections later this year, if the TMC eliminated the BJP in the assembly like in the recent municipal elections, and if the bjp's move towards Guwahati In order to stop the Congress alliance with Badruddin Ajmal's All India United Democratic Front in Assam, Modi and his soldiers have to face a tough fight May be required
 aise main chunauti vipaksh ko saath lekar chalane kii hogi, na ki usase takaraav mol lene kii

 pakistan kii ore se seemaa par phir golibaribharat se kii thi koi karrwai naa karne kii apilamangalvaar ko khud hi PAK ne shuru kii golibaripakistan adhikrut kashmir (pok) main aatankiyon ke khilaaf bhartiya sena kii karrwai ke baad PAK army mangalvaar ko kuch videshi adhikariyon ko us kshetra main le gai jahaan bhartiya sena ne ection liya
 The special thing is that for this occasion, the PAK Army had appealed to the Indian Army to stop their operations during this tour so that foreign officials do not suffer any harm
 bharat kii taraf se is dauraan puri tarah se sangharsh viraam rahaa lekin pakistan ne pintara badalte hue is bich seemaa par golibari jari rakhi
 The appeal was made on Monday by the Pakistani Army
 pakistan sena kaa kahana tha ki vah line of control se sate kuch ilaakon main videshi patrakaron or adhikariyon ko le janaa chaahate hai, aise main is din seemaa par kisi tarah kii karrwai naa ho
 When Pakistan took foreign journalists to this area of pok, the local residents in Muzaffarabad were protesting against the Pakistani army
 pakistan main maujuud videshi mediapakistan kii apil par bharat ne hami bhari thi
 But Pakistan retracted on its own promise and opened fire on Tuesday itself
 pakistan ne mangalvaar ko bhi border se sate ilaakon poonch, mendhar main golibari kii or sizafire kaa ulanghan kiya
 Due to this firing of Pakistan, school children are facing a lot of difficulties near the border area, as well as a woman has been injured
 ise padhein: bhartiya sena ke ection se pakistan main hadakamp, ab duniya ko de rahaa safyeeborder se sate kshetron main videshiyon ko le gaya pakgorawalaba he ki pakistan ne jo apil bharat se kii vah to maan lee gai thi, lekin vah apni hi baat par khara nahin utar sakaa
 Explain that Pakistan has been firing heavily along the border for the last one week, in response to this, India targeted terrorist bases in pok in front of Tangdhar sector
 bharat ke is ection main kai aatanki or pakistani sena ke jawan maare gaye the
 However, efforts are constantly being made by Pakistan to deny these claims
 isi kadi main pakistan mangalvaar ko kai videshi patrakaron or adhikariyon ko neelam ghati main le gaya or seemaa se sate ilaakon kaa daura karaayaa
 For the past two days, Pakistani army spokesman Asif Gafoor has been making statements against India continuously, saying that he invites the Indian commission to come to Neelum Valley so that he can check that anyone in that area There is no terrorist base
 haalanki, isse pehle bhi pakistan ne sargical strike, airstrike ke dauraan bhi aisa kiya tha or videshi media ko apane ilaakon main le jaakar propaganda failaayaa tha
 Two days after the decision of Bhopal gas scandal, the world's worst industrial disaster, the Government of Madhya Pradesh has decided to challenge this decision in the High Court
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne aaj yahaan samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet ke dauraan faisle ko niraashajanak qaraar dete hue kaha ki gas peediton ko nyaay dilaane ke liye sarkaar ne ise ucch nyaayalay main chunauti dene kaa nirnay liya he or iske sabhi kanoonee pahaluon par adhyayan ke liye ek paanch sadasyeey cameti gathit kii he
 He informed that in this committee, Advocate General R
K
 di
 Jain, former Advocates Vivek Tankha and Anand Mohan Mathur, Principal Secretary Law A
 ke
 Mishra and Shantilal Lodha
 pramukh sachiv vidhi samiti ke sanyojak rahenge
 He said that the committee has been asked to give its initial recommendation in 10 days and the final report within a month so that the decision can be challenged within the stipulated 90 days
 is maamle main kendra sarkaar or sibiai kii niyat par shankaa jataate hue chouhan ne kaha ki jab ucchtam nyaayalay ne gaiyr iradatan hatya kii dhaaraon ko laaparvaahee main badla tha tab kendra sarkaar or sibiai ne iske liye punarvichaar yachika daayar kyon nahin kii thi
 He said that similarly the efforts of extradition of Warren Anderson, the then president of Union Carbide, were also on paper and no serious efforts were made
 vidhivettaon se hui charchaa kaa hawala dete hue mukhyamantri ne kaha ki unhen bataaya gaya he ki (dhara 71 bhadanvi) prayek mrityu ke liye dhara 304 e kaa ek pruthak aparaadh nirmit hota he or prayek aise aparaadh ke liye do do saal ke hisaab se doshiyon ko kaaphi lambii sajaa di ja sakati he jo aaajeevan karawas se bhi adhik ho sakati he
 He said that the case is of CBI, therefore, the CBI should appeal to increase the punishment, but now after the amendment of the provision of Section 372 Criminal Procedure Code is amended, the aggrieved party can also appeal for enhancement of the sentence and since the victim in this case The party is the people and the state government represents the people, so it will not back down from punishing the culprits
 ek prashn ke uttar main chouhan ne kaha ki chunki sibiai hi is maamle ko dekh rahi thi isaliye rajya sarkaar ne is maamle main hastkshep nahin kiya tha lekin ab niraashajanak faisla aane ke baad sarkaar ne faisle ko chunauti dene kaa nirnay liya
 Describing Anderson's visit to India during the gas scandal as unfortunate to be released by the then government, the Chief Minister said that the central government would have to answer why Anderson was allowed to leave at that time
 unhone kaha ki hamen is baat kaa afsos he ki gas cond ke sabase bade doshi ko ham sajaa nahin dilaa paye
 The central government said that 6,901 was paid by the public sector banks to the airline, Kingfisher, which is struggling with the cash crisis
 86 karod rupee karj diya he
 Union Minister of State for Finance Namo Narayan Meena said that the state-run banks have allocated 5,792 to the aviation company under the fund based and non fund based limits
 66 karod rupee karj diya he
 Meena said in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha that apart from these banks also invested 1,109 in the company through investments in cumulative redeemable preference shares (CRPS) and non-convertible cumulative redeemable preference shares (NCCRPS)
 20 karod rupee lagaae hai
 In favor of State Bank of India, he said that the bank had bought the company's stock as an asset under the Master Debt Arrangement (MDRA) with the airline
 bhartiya state bank par aarope he ki usne oonche mulya par share liye hai
 Meena stated, "in the context of MDRA a portion of the debt was taken away and issued as CRPS, which was later 64 as on 31 March 2011
 48 rupee prati share ke aadhaar par company main hissedari ke rup main badal liya gaya
 Then the value of each share 39
 90rupee tha
 "the minister said that the bank took 11,63,30,639 shares of the company
 unhone kaha ki bank ne saat disambar ko vimaanan company ke sheyaron main 750
 10 crores invested, whose market value is now 298
 39 karod rupee he
 In Kashmir, the pictures of stone pelting are often seen, but this time a new plan is hidden in the pictures of stone pelting
 yah nayaa plan jammu-kashmirpuliskaa he
 In fact, the Jammu and Kashmir police took part in the caricatures of arresting real criminals who committed stone pelting and joined the crowd
 shuukravaar ko kashmir main jume kii namaaj ke baad patharbaj hameshaa kii tarah joardaarpattharbajikarne lage, tabhi bheed main bhesh badalakar shaamil pulicekarmiyon ne inako pakadana shuru kar diya
 During this, many stone-pellers were also arrested
 patharbaji karne vaale logon kii bheed main shaamil pulicekarmi unako pakadakar le laae
 At the same time, the security forces likewise kept trying to control the stone-pelters
 jammu-kashmir police ke is nae plan ko patharbaj tanik bhi nahin bhaanp paae
 When the misguided stone-pelters of Pakistan's pet separatists began to disguise the policemen involved in disguise in the crowd, they could not understand anything
 ye patharbaj pulicekarmiyon ko galati se apana dost samaj baithe the
 In the pictures which have appeared, the masked policeman is seen holding a young man from among the stone-pellers
 bataaya ja rahaa he kinakaabposh patharbajonko kaabo main karne ke liye jammu-kashmir ke jawan khud patharbaajon kii tarah bhesh banaakar nakaab baandhakar inke gut main shaamil hue
 Stoners considered him their partner and taking advantage of this, the security forces caught the ringleader
 isse pehle 2010 main bhi surakshabalon ne aisa hi plan apanaaya tha or ek baar phir patharbaajon ke group main shaamil hokar unhen pakadaney kaa ye formula apanaaya ja rahaa he
 Now the question here is whether this is the master stroke of the security forces against the stone-pelters or it may have its own disadvantages
 nishchit taur par patharbaajon par lagaam lagane kaa ye formula to thik he, magar isamen surakshabalon kii pahchaan jaahir ho jane kaa khatra bhi he
 However, some defense experts consider this strategy to be excellent
 do din pehle hi jammu-kashmir ke diji shishpal vaidya kaa tabadalaa hua he
 In his place, DG Jail Dilbag Singh has been given the command of Jammu and Kashmir
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki patharbaajon se nipatane ke liye nae diji ne nai yojana banaai he
 However, let us tell you that such a plan has not been confirmed by the Jammu and Kashmir Police, but it is believed that the plan to enter and capture the stone pelts is a new experiment to check the incidents of stone pelting
 
 ab ye prayog kitna safal hoga, yah to aane vaale vakt main pataa chalegaa
 On a busy road in the capital Delhi, there was chaos when a large part of it fell several feet below

 Amit Shah's life has changed after taking advantage of the Narendra Modi wave by playing a big role in the BJP winning 71 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh and its ally Apna Dal
 party mahasachiv shah ne agadi jatiyon ke varchasv vaali bijepi main ek nayaa obisi netritv khadaa kar diya he or is tarah obisi par samaajawaadee party kii majboot pakad ko kamjor kar diya he
 In Uttar Pradesh, Shah gave 50 percent tickets to other backward castes
 unke is faisle se pradesh main padane vaale prabhaav kaa adhyayan karne vaale vishleshak ise shah kaa ‘‘satta main hissedari kaa nayaa formula’’ kehete hai, jisamen vichaardhaara ke saath koi samjhauta nahin kiya gaya he
 These analysts say that most of the OBC candidates getting tickets are from BJP-RSS background and not from other parties
 raajnneetik vishleshak vidyut thaakar kehete hai, ‘‘shah ne pichley 15 varshon se niraash or niskriy party ke brahman-baniyaa netritv main nayaa josh bharaa or uske jariye aresas-bijepi ke apane obisi ummidavaaron ko tikat dilvaaya
 a good example of this is the Lok Sabha seat of Sambhal, on which the BJP had never won
 jatigat ganit ke aadhaar par shah ne ati pichhadi mali jati ke ummidavaar satyapal singh saini ko tikat diya
 When Shah informed Saini that he was being given a party ticket, Saini cried because she never expected that she would get a ticket in the upper-caste dominated BJP

" ’’ phulpur main shah ne bijepi ke pravaktaa siddharth narayan singh ke daawey ko khaarij karte hue bijepi-aresas ke ek anya netaa keshav maury ko tikat diya tha
 Maurya was a resident of that constituency and belonged to a backward caste, due to which Shah decided to give him the ticket
 modi ke sahyogi shah bhale hi nai sarkaar main mantri na hon, lekin unke paas sanghathan kaa kaaphi kaam he
 He has become the most important leader for the BJP, whether he is the president of the party or not
 unhen yah haisiyat vichaardhaara se kisi tarah kaa samjhauta kiye bina unki sanghathanaatmak kushalta or ranneeti banane main maharath ke kaaran mili he
 His importance in the party has increased manifold, as a large number of party officials have now joined the government
 party adhyaksh rajnath singh, upaadhyaksh smriti irani or koshadhyaksh piyush goyal se lekar mahasachivon dharmendra pradhan or thavar chand gahalot ke alaava party pravaktaa prakaash javdekar or nirmala sitaraman tak sarkaar main hai
 Looking at the way Shah has been able to change the social structure of the party in Uttar Pradesh, he is expected to bring a similar change in states like Tamil Nadu, Odisha and West Bengal, where Modi wave The reason is bjp's vote percentage has increased
 ise anjaam dene main shah or unki team jute bhi gai he
 Actually elections are going to be held in six states in the next six months
 inamen chaar maharashtra, haryana, jharkhand or jammu-kashmir main to vidhansabha ke chunaav isi saal ke ant tak hone tay hai
 Apart from these, if the situation remains the same in the politically unstable Delhi and Uttarakhand, elections can be held in these two states
 dilli main pradesh bijepi netritv jod-tod kii koshishon main laga he par baat banane kii sambhaavna kam hi dikhti he
 The Congress government is in trouble after Satpal Maharaj joined the BJP in Uttarakhand as he claims nine mlas are with him
 in sabhi rajyon main amit shah kaa formula aajamaane kii koshish kii jaaegi
 Shah is currently busy collecting poll and political figures for all these states where elections are or are likely to be held
 unke radar par yah he ki in rajyon main pichhadi jatiyon kaa aresas-bijepi se judaav kitna he or party ke vibhinn sanghathanon or manchon main unki kya haisiyat he, jamini str par ve kitne majboot hai or vichaardhaara se samjhauta kiye bina unka netritv kaisaa sthapit ho saktaa he
 This is exactly the formula based on which the view of Uttar Pradesh has changed
 is baari kaam main unki madad unke intnet premi putr jai or nijee sahaayak kripal pandya va palak shah raajnneetik aankade jutaney or uskaa vishleshan karne main kar rahe hai
 Shah himself belongs to the Baniya caste
 ve kehete hai ki unki jindagi kii sabase badi chunautiyon main ek uttar pradesh main hi rahi he jise anjaam dene ke baad unamem kuch yakeen aayaa he
 After all, there is a dramatic rise of the party there
 party kaa vot 14 pratishat se badhkar 43 pratishat ho gaya or siton kii sankhya 10 se badhkar 71 ho gai
 This rise will soon have to form a permanent mass base so that the party can perform like this in the next assembly elections
 shah kehete hai, ‘‘jin logon ne modi ji or bijepi ko vot diya, ve turant badlaav chaahate honge or yah puri tarah tabhi sambhav he jab ham agle vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet hasil karen
 There should be no laxity to make this rise permanent in Uttar Pradesh

 The Modi government has truly worked for the poor, while everyone in the Congress, from Nehru to Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Narasimharao and Manmohan Singh, gave the slogan of 'poverty Hatao' but poverty did not go away

 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar ke pehle aatankwaadi desh main alag alag jagahon par bam visphot karte the
 The Congress government of that time used to send only letters to Pakistan and demanded action
 upmukhyamantri ke mutabaki, modi ji ne piem banane ke baad pakistan jaakar vahaan ke piem navaj sharif se kaha ki sharif banakar raho
 Leave these miscreants with you

 agast main bollywood kii sabase badi kaamyaab filmon main se ek 'sholay' apni kamyaabi ke 40 saal puraa kar rahi he
 Like every cinematic superstar Salman Khan has this film in his heart
 unke liye yah film na keval apni achchhaayiyon kii vajah se khaas he, balki isliye bhi ki 'sholay' ko unke pita saleem khan ne javed akhtar ke saath milakar likhaa tha
 When Salman was asked about some old memories after completing 40 years of 'sholay', he told how he had gone to the screening of the film with his younger brother Arbaaz in childhood
 tippaniyan Praising 'sholay', Salman said, 'such a film cannot be made again
 agar kisi ne us film ko banane kii koshish kii bhi he, to uskaa hashr bura hua he
 " salmaan ne kaha, "sholay ek yaadgaar film he
 Is a film written in a great way
 uske ek-ek samvaad aaj bhi mashhoor hai or bole jate hai
 The way the actors played his short written dialogues was unmatched

 " Salman said, "sholay is a memorable film
 behtareen tareeke se likhi gai film he
 Every one of his dialogues is still famous and spoken
 uske chote-chote likhe gaye dialogs ko jis tarah kalakaaron ne adaa kiya vah bemisaal rahaa
 " bharat ke shaharon ko kareeb se dekhne kii jarurat he
 Cars are full on the roads and man is stuck in those cars for hours
 hawa kii haalat kharaab he
 There is a little rain that the cities start sinking
 bharat kaa aisa koi pramukh shahar nahin bachaa he jo trephic jam or pradooshit hawa se karaah nahin rahaa he
 We feel that this is a problem, but now we must assume that our cities are on the verge of dying
 inhen behatar banaae jane kii baaten akhabaaron main hi hoti hai, jameen par kam hi dikhataa he
 Opportunities also exist in these cities, so obviously the pressure of population will also increase
 bees saal se shahar kii suvidhaon kaa nijeekaran kiya gaya
 Perhaps some more privatization is being done
 magar is prakriya main nigamon ke prashasan main jo kamajori ai he, usase samasya or bhi badi he
 Janaagraha Center for Citizenship and Democracy of Bengaluru has concluded this by surveying 21 cities
 har shahar kii alag-alag paimaanon par reating kii gai he is lihaaz se kisi bhi shahar ne bahut behatar pradarshan nahin kiya he
 Meaning you cannot treat anyone as a model city
 tiruvanantpuram, pune or kolkata desh ke chotii ke shaharon main aate hai
 Delhi was at sixth position in 2015, falling to ninth position in 2016
 shahari prashasan ke teen binduon par dilli kaa pradarshan kharaab rahaa he
 Delhi has a population of 18 million
 desh kii rajdhani bhopal or kanpur se bhi peeche he
 The people of Kanpur need not be happy to hear this
 brihanmumbai nagarpalika chunaav ke vakt hamane bataaya tha ki kanpur ke paas rajasav vasuuli ke kanoon mumbai se bahut behatar hai magar yah shahar makaanon kii sankhya ke anupaat main property tex vasuul nahin paata he
 Delhi has got the highest marks in terms of city planning
 mumbai or bengalooru se bhi zyada
 i don't get very excited about ratings
 har reating agency ke alag-alag paimaane hote hai or alag-alag reating hoti hai
 Nevertheless, if there is a chance to discuss about the administration of cities, their transparency, accountability and participation, then it should not be let go by hand
 survey main paaya gaya he ki 21 shahar jinata kharch karte hai, uskaa 37 fisadi hi vasuul kar pate hai
 Patna gets 17 per cent from itself
 is shahar ko bhi aaparishan kii sakht jarurat he
 Mumbai, Hyderabad and Pune are the three cities that generate 50 per cent of their expenditure on their own
 survey main kaha gaya he ki bharat kaa koi bhi shahar landan or neuyark kaa muqabla nahin kar saktaa
 By saying this, we do not know what problems London and New York have
 is survey ke liye banaae gaye paimaane ke liye das number rakhe gaye
 No city in India has achieved more than four points
 jabaki landan or neuyark ko 9
 4 and 9
 7 ank mili hai
 No Indian city has a concrete policy to prevent violations of the master plan
 har shahar main anadhikrut coloniyaan punap rahi hai
 In this case, all the cities of India got zero marks
 anadhikrut colony or jhuggiyon ko pesh karne kii apni raajnneeti he
 Sixty to seventy percent of people live in a slum-like place in Delhi itself
 inkaa maamla sirf vaid or avaidh ke chashme se nahin dekha ja saktaa he
 However, encroachment is also a fact, which the rich and influential people take advantage of more than the poor
 jaise puure shahar kii saarvajanik jagah par logon ne apni kaaron se kabja kar rakhaa he
 Go to the locality of the locality and see if the car of the people is standing at the place of walking
 ham is atikaraman ko nahin dekhte hai magar jhuggi main rahane vaale logon ko, chunki ve garib or kamjor hote hai, samasya ke rup main dekhte hai
 Therefore, he said that the attitude of looking at a slum is a political view in itself
 2014 main bengalooru municipal karporation ne 400 imaaraton kaa survey kiya tha
 Only three followed the rules
 isliye garib or kamjor logon kii tulana main saadhan sampann log, jo khud ko tex dene vaala kehete hai, niyamon ko todate hai
 They overstep
 unki colony kii sadak sarkaar ke paise se banati he magar get lagaakar ve use apana bana lete hai
 This is when even one percent people do not pay tax in this country
 ham baat karenge ki kya jin logon ne legal tareeke se makaan banaae hai, kya ve sabhi house tex dete hai
 The survey raises some questions which should be debated like - we have to see how much we are investing in corporations and municipalities
 shaharon kii yojana ke zyaadaatar kanoon pichhali sadi ke bane hue hai
 India has a planner, planner on a population of four lakhs
 america main chaar lakh par 48 or britain main 148 planar hai
 We do not even know exactly what the role of the planner is
 aisa nahin he ki shaharon ko lekar kuch nahin ho rahaa he
 It is happening but some work is being done here and some there
 system ke str par abhi badlaav kii shuruyaat nahin hui he
 No one is getting this thing today, nor is the Janagraha picking up for the first time, but rather you pick up the newspapers of the big cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Pune and Kolkata in the past, there is a lot of discussion about the problem of corporations
 khabaren hoti hai
 The example of Rajasthan and Orissa is given in the survey report, we will talk about that
 urisa bharat kaa pehla rajya he jahaan nigamon or nagarpalikon ke adhikariyon ke liye alag se municipal cader bana he
 Read this report by visiting the website, you will get to understand a lot
 jaise - ek lakh kii aabaadi par staff kii bhi bade se lekar chote shaharon main bhayankar kami he
 Delhi has 1260 employees at one lakh, while Ranchi has just 87
 pani kitna li hua, istemaal hua, is par nazar rakhane kaa koi system nahin he
 Normally everyone should get water supply, but only 71 percent of the population gets it
 pani kii aapurti par jo laagat aati he uskaa 39 fisadi hi nigam vasuul pate hai
 Obviously, the condition of water supply in the cities is poor
 ham aapurti kii baat karte hai magar pani bachaane kaa kahin koi prayaas nahin he
 Similarly, there is no better waste management system in any city
 aadhe-adhure tareeke se kachra uthaaya jaataa he, khub bhrashtachar he
 Councilors are partners in garbage picking agencies, which should not be
 kisi bhi shahar main parshadon ko paryaapt or spasht adhikaar nahin mili hai
 On this scale, every city in India has got only three out of ten marks
 lekin kerala kii rajdhani tiruvanantpuram main aisa kya khaas he jise do baar se pehla sthaan mil rahaa he
 There is a single bag in this first place
 tiruvanantpuram ko 10 se 4
 Got 4 points
 yani bina first divizan laae koi shahar pehle number par aa gaya he
 Thiruvananthapuram is number one in terms of voting
 yahaan nagarpalika ke chunaav main 72 fisadi matdaan hota he
 Kolkata is at number two with 69 percent voting, Ludhiana at number three is 63 percent
 patna main 47 fisadi hi matdaan hota he
 There is interesting information on page number 25 in the survey report about what cities claim and what they are
 kaig kii report ke aadhaar par yah suchi banaai gai he
 According to this, what Thiruvananthapuram claims in terms of urban planning is not in reality
 building banane ke maamle main bhi iskaa daawa asaliyat se dur he
 The claims made regarding supply of water in domestic and industrial matters are not in reality
 public health, safai, kachra prabandhan ke maamle main bhi shahar jo daawa karata he, hakeekat main nahin he
 The situation is also bad in the case of fire safety
 gadaribi kam karne ke maamle or jhuggiyon ko behatar banane ke maamle main tiruvanantpuram ne jo daawa kiya he, wo hakeekat ke kareeb he
 It also performs well in terms of road and bridge
 kaig kii report bharat ke number van shahar kii is tarah se pole khol detii he
 But you do not go to the rating, the basic question that arises through this report is whether our municipalities are able to function better
 kyon hamaare shaharon kii sthiti naarkeey bani hui he
 Why the mayor's rights are not clear
 kyon rajasav vasuuli kam he
 Why the performance of all the cities of India is same in case of encroachment
 mujhe pataa he ki aapako aapkaa shahar bahut sataata he
 Every day makes you stand in traffic jam for hours, no water on time, neighborhood school is bad
 survey kuch sawaal uthta he jin par bahes honi chahie jaise- hamen dekhnaa hoga ki ham nigamon or nagarpalikaon main kitna nivesh kar rahe hai
 Most of the laws of the planning of cities remain from the last century
 bharat main chaar lakh kii aabaadi par ek planar he, niojak he
 There are 48 lakhs in the United States and 148 in the UK
 planar kii kya bhoomika he, yah bhi ham thik se nahin jaanate hai
 It is not that nothing is happening about cities
 ho rahaa he magar kuch kaam yahaan acha ho rahaa he to kuch vahaan
 The change has not yet begun at the system level
 yah baat koi aaj nahin uth rahi he, na hi janaaagrah pehali baar uthaa rahaa he, balki aap pichley mumbai, dilli, bengalooru, pune or kolkata jaise bade shaharon ke akhbaar uthaakar dekh len unamem nigamon kii samasya ko lekar khub charchaa hoti he
 There are news
 rajasthan or urisa kaa udhaaharan survey report main diya gaya he, ham us par baat karenge
 Orissa is the first state in India to have a separate municipal cadre for officers of corporations and municipalities
 is report ko aap website par jaakar jarur padhein kaaphi kuch samajhane ko milegaa
 For example, on a population of one lakh, there is a severe shortage of staff in large to small cities
 dilli main ek lakh par 1260 karmchaaree hai to ranchi main sirf 87
 There is no system to monitor how much water leaked, was used
 kaayade se sabhi ko pani kii supplai milani chahie, magar 71 pratishat aabaadi ko hi milti he
 Only 39 percent of the cost incurred on water supply is collected by the corporation
 jaahir he shaharon main pani aapurti kii haalat kharaab he
 We talk about supply but there is no effort to save water
 isi tarah se kisi bhi shahar main kachra prabandhan ke behatar intjaam nahin hai
 Garbage is raised half-way, there is a lot of corruption
 parshad kachra uthaane vaali agenciyon main hissedaar hote hai, jo nahin hona chahie
 Councilors have not got sufficient and clear rights in any city
 is paimaane par bharat ke har shahar ko das main se teen ank hi mili hai
 But what is special about Kerala's capital Thiruvananthapuram which is getting the first place twice
 is pehle sthaan main ek bhi jhol he
 10 to 4 to Thiruvananthapuram
 4 ank mili hai
 That is, without bringing first division, a city has come at number one
 matdaan ke maamle main tiruvanantpuram pehle number par he
 Municipal elections here account for 72 percent of the vote
 duusare number par kolkata he jahaan 69 fisadi matdaan hota he, tisare number par ludhiana he jahaan 63 fisadi log matdaan karte hai
 In Patna, 47 percent of the vote is held
 survey report main pej number 25 par dilachasp jaankaree he ki shahar daawa kya karte hai or unki asaliyat kya he
 This list has been made on the basis of the CAG report
 iske anusaar tiruvanantpuram urban planning ke maamle main jo daawa karata he vah asaliyat main nahin he
 Even in the case of building, its claim is far from real
 gharelu or audyogic maamle main pani kii supplai ko lekar jo daawa kiya gaya he wo hakeekat main nahin he
 In the case of public health, sanitation and waste management, what the city claims is not in reality
 fire sefti ke maamle main bhi sthiti kharaab he
 The claims made by Thiruvananthapuram in terms of reducing gadriabi and improving slums are close to reality
 sadak or pul ke maamle main bhi iskaa pradarshan acha he
 The CAG report exposes the number one city of India in this way
 magar aap reating par mat jaaie, is report ke zarie jo mul sawaal uthte hai wo yah hai ki kya hamaari nagarpalikaayen behatar tareeke se kaam kar paa rahi hai
 Why the condition of our cities remains hellish
 meyar ke adhikaar kyon nahin spasht hai
 Why revenue collection is low
 kyon atikaraman ke maamle main bharat ke tamaam shaharon kaa pradarshan ek sa he
 i know that your city haunts you a lot
 har din trephic jam main aapako ghanton khadaa karata he, samay par pani nahin aata, pados kaa skool kharaab he
 The country's capital Delhi once again became ashamed
 yahaan ek neshnal kabddi khilaadi ke saath rape kii sansanikhej vaardaat hui he
 Not only this, two minor girls have also been victimized by lust
 unhen mara hua samajhakar jhaadiyon main phenkakar chale gaye
 In both cases, police are registering cases and investigating
 jaankaree ke mutabik, dilli main ek junior level kii neshnal kabddi khilaadi kaa aarope he ki 9 july ko wo chhatrasaal stadium gai thi
 He found a man there
 usne khud ko stadium kaa prashaasak or coach bataaya
 He was about 30 years old
 usne ghumaane ke bahaane se kabddi khilaadi ko apni car main baitha liya
 The victim alleges that after taking something further away, the accused punched her on the neck
 isse wo behosh ho gai
 When she regained consciousness, she was in a flat
 iske baad aaropee ne uske saath rape kiya
 She then fainted
 agle din aaropee peedita ko raste me chhod diya
 Threatened to kill if told about the incident
 vaardaat ke kareeb ek saptaah baad peedita ne model toun thane main jaakar police ko shikaayat di he
 The police have registered a case against the accused under Section 376 of the IPC and the Poxo Act on the basis of the victim's statement and Tahrir
 peedita kaa medical karaayaa ja rahaa he
 a police team is searching for the accused coach
 naaballig ko banaaya havas kaa shikaravahin, rajdhani dilli ke bavana ilaake main naaballig bacchiyon ko havaas kaa shikaar banaae jane kii sansanikhej ghatana saamne ai he
 Here, the accused, along with two minors, threw them into the bushes after assuming them dead
 agle din subah parijanon ko lahooluhaan bacchiyaan mili hai
 He has been admitted for treatment in Ambedkar Hospital

 Sonu Nigam made a tweet on the azaan to be held in the mosque this morning, which has triggered a new debate
 bataa den ki masjidon main subah oonchi aawaaj main ajaan hoti he or iske liye laud spikar bhi lagaae jate hai
 It is evident that this sound opens everyone's sleep
 isi parsonu nigam ne twitakia he ki agar wo muslim nahin hai to masjid kii ajaan kii aawaaj se unako kyon roj subah uthanaa padataa he
 At the same time, he also wrote that how long we will have to force such religious practices
 sonu nigam ne isekhuleam gundgardee bataaya
 However, he also wrote that he has a problem with this happening in temples and gurudwaras as well
 bijli kaa avishkaar is kaam ke liye nahin hua tha
 People are getting mixed reactions in social media as soon as this tweet goes viral

 Let us tell you that in the last several days, many liquor shops have been locked in UP, after which the speculation of prohibition was intensified
 jai pratap singh ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar ek saal baad sharaab ke upar nai niti laaegi, kyonki pichhali sarkaar ne 2 varsh kaa rajasav pehle hi jamaa kara diya he
 He said that Nitish Kumar had imposed prohibition in Bihar because it was part of his manifesto
 lekin uttar pradesh sarkaar kii aisi koi yojana nahin he
 Let us tell you that after the Supreme Court ban on highway paraphernalia shops, more than 5 thousand shops have been closed out of about 8 and a half thousand shops, or have surrendered licenses due to protest

 Is it necessary to examine the ground reality of the funds that are coming to increase and encourage the influence of Saudi style Islam (salafi or Wahhabi sect) in the country? Only through the Foreign Grant Regulation Act (FCRA) of the Ministry of Home Affairs can the path of such funds be officially detected
 NDTV ne pichley teen saal kaa epasiare ke data kaa vishleshan yah jaanane ke liye kiya he ki islamic charities se kitne salaafi enjio ko chanda mila he
 Under this, the details of donations of about Rs
 134 crores were found which is a very small part of the annual amount under FCRA
 aam dharna yah he ki sabase adhik is tarah kaa chanda saudi arab se aata he jabaki is vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki aisa nahin he
 The highest donation of Rs 51 crore came from United Arab Emirates (UAE), followed by Rs 36 crore from Britain
 kuwait se 23 karod rupee or canada se 10 karod rupee aae
 4 as donations from Saudi Arabia in this period
 5 karod rupee mili
 In fact, these figures do not present a complete picture of Salafi mosques and madrassas spread across the country
 dilli main desh ke pramukh salaafi sanghathan aihal-e-haddees ke head-offis main hamen bataaya gaya ki iske puure desh main kareeb ek hajaar madrase hai
 This figure is 10 times the total number of Salafi ngos listed in FCRA
 haalanki is sanghathan ke sadasyon kaa kahana he ki sthaneey donneshnon yaa self funding se yah vistaar hua he
 But in this regard, Ajay Sawhney, executive director of Delhi's Institute of Conflict Management and South Asia Terrorism Portal, says that some of the expansion may also be related to the flow of illegal money
 unke mutabik, ''bade paimaane par avaidh lenden dikhaai detaa he
 Hawala, recent cases presenting false facts as seen in the Zakir Naik case

 '' haalanki salaafi log kehete hai ki unki apil islam kii shuddhtavaadi varjan par aadhaarit he or isi kii shiksha dena unka makasad he or unke badhaav se chintit hone kii koi baat nahin he
 But when NDTV visited several Salafi madrassas in UP and Karnataka, we found that many disputed Saudi Salafi scholars were included in the curriculum
 masalan 13veen sadi ke upadeshak ebn taiyamiyah ko shaamil kiya gaya he jo prabhavi mardin fatwa ke lekhak hai
 Generally, jihadi groups all over the world resort to this to justify violence
 is maamle main moulana aaazaad neshnal urdu uniwarsity, hyderabad ke arabic studies ke head of department dow saiyad ashraf jaishi kaa kahana he, ''puri duniya main faile hue aatanki sanghathan ebn taiyamiyah ke siddhanton or paramparaon par aadhaarit hai
 These quotes from Ibn Taymiyyah's books, specifically the Mardin fatwa, in which he states that a target can kill him to achieve his goals or defeat enemies or to target someone
 '' Also included in the course of the Salafi madrasas are Ibn Abd al-wahhab, the successor of Taymiyyah, who is said to have interpreted the Quran for his divisive concept 'al Vallah Vall Bara'
 islamic studies ke scollar gulam rasul dehalavi ne is sambandh main kaha, ''iskaa vastav main arth he: al valah yani muslimon ke saath vafadari or val baaraa yani gaiyr muslimon ke saath dushmani
 He referred to some specific verses of the Quran which said, 'do not have friendship with Jews and Christians
 ' haalanki wahaab ne inaki sandarbh se itar vyakhya kii
 '' salaafi madrason main ek anya padhai jane vaali kitaab bhartiya maulavee ismail dehalavi kii takviatul imaan (dharm kii takat) he jisamen bharat kii sufi parampara ko gaiyr-islamic tehraaya gaya he
 When NDTV interacted with the heads of Salafi mosques in these two states, they strongly supported these books and expressed sentiments against the Sufi tradition
 tippaniyan In this case, Abdul Waheed Madani, founder of Safa Educational Society of Dumariyaganj (UP), says, "it is a situation that people do not have time to visit the tomb of their parents and instead go to Ajmer Sharif
 ye puri tarah se galat he or aisa nahin hona chahie
 If anything wrong is done for 1,000 years, it will remain wrong
 '' Although the Salafi teachings may not be equated with extremism, Sufi scholars are concerned with the growing influence of the Wahhabi sect in India
 is maamle main lakhanu ke sufi vaais of india ke sansthaapak saiyad babar ashraf kaa kahana he, ''jaraa sochie (sufi sant) nizamuddin auliya ko jab talwaar saunpi gai to unhone kaha ki mujhe isaki kya jarurat he? mujhe sui chahie taaki main bunai kar sakuun
 i am the person who does not tear things but stitch them
 '' NDTV has analyzed the data of FCRA for the last three years to know how many Salafi ngos have received donations from Islamic Charities
 iske tahat kareeb 134 karod rupee ke chande kaa byora mila jo epasiare ke tahat salanaa aane vaali raashi kaa behad chota hissaa he
 The general belief is that most such donations come from Saudi Arabia, while this analysis shows that it is not
 sarvaadhik 51 karod rupee kaa chanda sanyukt arab emirate (yuai) se mila, uske baad britain se 36 karod rupee kaa chanda mila
 23 crore came from Kuwait and 10 crore from Canada
 is avadhi main saudi arab se chande ke rup main 4
 5 crores received
 vastav main ye aankade desh bhar main faile salaafi masjidon or madrason ke aankadon kii puri tasviir pesh nahin karte
 In Delhi, at the head office of the country's leading Salafi organization aihal-e-hadith, we were told that it has about one thousand madrassas all over the country
 yah aankada epasiare main soochibaddh salaafi enjio kii kul sankhya kii tulana main 10 guna adhik he
 However, members of this organization say that this has been expanded by local donations or self-funding
 lekin is sambandh main dilli ke institute of conphilict management and south asia terarysm portal ke akjicutive diarector ajay saahani kaa kahana he ki kuch vistaar avaidh dhan ke pravaah se bhi sambandhit ho saktaa he
 According to him, "large-scale illegal transactions appear
" hawala, galat tathyon ko pesh karne vaale haalia keson jaisaa ki jakir nik maamle main dekhne ko miltaa he
 He had many transactions through media companies
 '' However, the Salafis say that their appeal is based on the purist version of Islam and that their motive is to teach and there is nothing to be worried about their growth
 lekin upi or karnataka main jab NDTV ne kai salaafi madrason kaa daura kiya to hamane paaya ki kai vivaadit saudi salaafi viddhanon ko paathyakram main shaamil kiya gaya he
 For example, the 13th century preacher Ibn Taymiyyah is included, who is the author of the effective Mardin Fatwa
 aamtaur par puri duniya main jihadi samooh hinsa ko nyyochit tehraane ke liye iskaa sahaara lete hai
 In this case, Dr
 Syed Ashraf Jaishi, Head of Department, Arabica Studies, Maulana Azad National Urdu University, Hyderabad, says, "terrorist organizations spread all over the world are based on the principles and traditions of Ibn Taymiyyah
 ye ebn taiyamiyah kii kitabon ke uddharanon vishesh rup se mardin fatwa kaa hawala dete hai jisamen unhone kaha he ki koi lakshya apane lakshyon ko hasil karne yaa dushmano ko haraane yaa kisi ko nishaanaa banane ke liye use maar saktaa he

 In this regard, Islamic Studies scholar Ghulam Rasul Dehalvi said, "it really means: Al Vallah means loyalty with Muslims and Vall Bara means enemy with non-muslims
" unhone quran kii kuch khaas aayaton kaa zikr kiya jisamen kaha gaya, 'yahudiyon or isaiyon ke saath dosti mat karo
 However, Wahab interpreted them out of context

 This was revealed through an RTI, in which names of all the surviving and late freedom fighters of UP were asked
 shuruyaat main sarkari vibhaag iskaa jawaab dene main taalamatol karte rahe
 But when the matter finally reached the Information Commission in appeal, a list of 316 freedom fighters was given from the Department of Political Pensions of UP
 magar is list se samaajawaadee andolan ke janak or angrejon ke khilaaf sabase mukhar aawaaj rakhane valeram manohar lohiaka naam gaayab tha
 Not even Captain Abbas Ali, the freedom fighter, as well as the name of Captain Abbas Ali was missing in this list, who is specially remembered for joining hands with the British along with Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose

 It is a shame for the SP that this disclosure was very embarrassing for the Samajwadi Party, who has the power to follow Lohia's principles, because the Samajwadi Party has named Lohia to define his thinking whenever he has been in government
 Is used indiscriminately
 itnaa hi nahin, sarkaar kii sabase mahatvakankshi yojanaon kaa naam bhi ram manohar lohia ke naam par hi rakhaa gaya he
 Be it housing schemes for the poor or hospitals, roads, schools, colleges, universities and parks
 vipaksh ko mil gaya maukisamen koi shaq nahin ki sarkaar kii is bhul ne vipaksh ko hamale kaa mauka de diya he
 The BSP considers it to be a thoughtful policy of SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav to rise above Lohia and become the face of socialism

 This did not happen, it means that sp's Lohia love is false and just pretense

 The Samajwadi Party, which has formed the government in UP five times, is not ready to believe that the name of its inspirational and ideological source Ram Manohar Lohia is missing behind the list of freedom fighters
 samaajawaadee party ke emelsi yashavanth singh ne kaha, 'bharat main congress party kii sarkaar bani
 And the Congress tried to show that its leaders fought the freedom of fighting for the country
 duusare yoddhaon kii upeksha kaa puraa prayaas kiya congress ne, isliye unke naam swatantraaa senaniyon kii suchi main dhundne main dikkat aa rahi he
 'on the other hand, the Department of Political Pensions on the other side has also presented a clarification on this matter
 vibhageeya sutron kaa kahana he ki swatantraaa senaniyon kii list main sirf unheen mahapurushon ke naam shaamil hai jinhone pension lenaa sweekaar kiya
 Since Ram Manohar Lohia of Ambedkaranagar district and Captain Abbas Ali of Aligarh remained unmarried throughout their lives as they lived a simple life, they refused to take pension from the government treasury
 isliye unka naam pension lene vaale swatantraaa senaniyon kii list main shaamil nahin ho paaya

 This is the reason why this woman, who is counting the count of her death in jail, has plagued the jail authorities
 usne jail athurity ko khaane ke saamaanon kii ek lambii-chaudee list thama di he
 The list includes many things from cheese burgers to cherry vanilla ice cream
 reni kaa kahana he ki vah maut se pehle in sab chizon kaa lutf lenaa chaahati hai
 Renee has given the prison authority a list of two cheeseburgers, cornbread with buttermilk, popcorn, lemonade, lettuce with boiled eggs, capsicum, onions, carrots and cheese among many other things
 neuyork daily ko die ek bayaan main jail adhikari ne bataaya ki wo cheri vanilla icecream bhi chaahati he
 Renee was sentenced to death in 1997 after being convicted of plotting the brutal murder of her husband Douglas Gesindner
 mukademe kii sunwaayee karne vaali juri ke saamne yah sabit hua ki reni ne hi apane pati hi hatya karwaai thi
 Renee persuaded her boyfriend to kill her by kidnapping her husband at the point of a knife and taking him away
 is dauraan reni khud apni saheliyon ke saath dance karne chali gai thi
 The boyfriend obeyed her and did what Renee wanted
 iske baad reni ne boyfriend ke saath milakar apane pati kii laash ko ek ped se ulta lataka diya, taaki junglee jaanavar use kha jaaen
 Renee wanted to kill her husband and pay off her home loan with her insurance money
 lekin hatya ke baad use pataa chalaa ki uske pati ne kabhi koi policy lee hi nahin thi
 Kelly later became hostile to her boyfriend, with her boyfriend being sentenced to 25 years in prison
 reni ko 1998 main hatya kaa doshi paane ke baad maut kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 Last year, the Supreme Court also refused to hear Renee's appeal in the case
