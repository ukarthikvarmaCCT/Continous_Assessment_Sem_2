 vikiliks ne is sandesh kaa khulaasa kiya he
 This message dated April 6, 2010 is signed by the then US Ambassador to India, David Mulford
 is sandesh ko america mishan ke tatkaaleen up pramukh robert blake ne gopneey shrenee main rakhaa tha jo ab dakshin or madhya asian maamalon ke sahaayak mantri hai
 The US has accused wikileaks of stealing confidential messages but has refused to confirm or deny the authenticity of these messages

 This person had reported that in the recent interaction of Red Cross with the Government of India, officials said that the human rights situation in Kashmir is much better than in the nineties

 ’sandesh kahata he ki malford ne apni tippanee main kaha ki redcross ne beete kai varsh ke apane tareeke ko badla he or america duutavas ko byoraa diya he
 This reflects the organization's disappointment with the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Home Affairs

 After the double train accident in Madhya Pradesh, Shiv Sena, the government's ally, has raised questions on the railway system
 party ne apane mukhpatr 'saamana' main railway ke tantra ko 'khayraat tantra' bataaya he
 'saamana' also indirectly satirized the bullet train scheme

 On one hand, there is a bullet train exercise in the country, on the other hand it takes months to fix a signal
 'shivasena se bijepi main aae hai rail mantrishivsena kii yah aalochana raajnneetik taur par isliye bhi ahm he kyonki maujuuda rail mantri suresh prabhu ne apana puraa raajnneetik kariyar shivasena main bitaayaa tha, lekin chunki pradhanmantri modi unhen cabinet main lenaa chaahate the, isliye unhen achaanak bijepi main shaamil kar liya gaya tha

 The railway department will have to learn from this accident

 i have said it before and once again i say that there is no doubt that Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh are champions
 main abhi ek nai shuruyaat karne ja rahaa hum or iske liye mujhe team ke khilaadiyon ke saath-saath captain ke saath bhi ek lambaa samay bitaana padenga

 champions trophy ke baad westedies main bhi unka balla nahin chalaa jiske baad kai diggajon ne unke team main hone par sawaal uthaae
 Now it remains to be seen what decision they take on Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni after Ravi Shastri became the coach
 yen bhi padhein, shastri yug main yuvaraj-dhoni ke liye jagah nahin? aswin ke liye bhi ho sakati he mushkilakhilaadiyon ko milegi aazaadeeiske alaava ravi shastri ne kaha ki, wo ek nai shuruyaat karnaa chaahate hai

 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki main maujuuda khiladiyon kii style ke saath koi chhedchhad nahin karuunga
 Because on a large level, you need a lot of coaching and there is not much change

 Anna Hazare left for his village Ralegan Siddhi on Monday after an uproar in Team Anna's core committee meeting
 anna ne kaha ki mobile kii madad se meeting kii baat li ho rahi thi, jo sahi nahin he
 On organizing a joint movement with Ramdev, Anna said that we will not hang out together, but if different movements meet at one place, they have no objection to sharing the stage with Ramdev
 donon hi andolan bhrashtachar ke khilaaf hai or kaledhan ke mudde par vah baba ramdev ke andolan kaa samarthan karte hai
 The comments team anna kii kor cameti kii baithak ke baad hi yah saaf ho gaya tha ki anna or baba ramdev saajha abhiyaan nahin chalaayenge, balki jarurat padane par donon ek-duusare kii madad karenge
 Earlier on Friday, Anna and Ramdev's shared press conference felt that Anna and Ramdev have come together and will organize a movement against the government, but on Sunday everything reversed
 darasal anna hajaare or baba ramdev kii saajha press conference or saath−saath ladane ke elaan ke baad team anna main matbhed bad gaye the, jiske baad hi yah bich kaa rasta nikaala gaya he
 Team Anna's core committee meeting on Sunday was very ruckus
 hangaamaa us vakt shuru hua, jab cameti ke sadsy mufti samim kaasmi ko baithak se baahar jane ke liye kaha gaya
 Team Anna accused the mufti that he was recording the things going on in the meeting
 meeting se behad gusse main baahar aae mufti ne kaha ki un par galat aarope lagaae gaye hai, isliye vah anna ke andolan se alag ho gaye hai, saath hi unhone kaha ki team anna ko arvind kejariwal or manish sitaudiya ne hijank kar liya he or ve kisi taanashaah kii tarah team anna ko chalaa rahe hai
 It was only after the meeting of Team Anna's core committee that it was clear that Anna and Baba Ramdev would not run a joint campaign, but instead they would help each other when needed
 isse pehle shuukravaar ko anna or ramdev kii saajha press conference se laga tha ki anna or ramdev saath aa gaye hai or sarkaar ke khilaaf milakar andolan chalaayenge, lekin ravivaar ko sab kuch palat gaya
 Actually, after Anna Hazare and Baba Ramdev's shared press conference and the announcement of fighting together, differences had increased in Team Anna, after which this middle ground has been found
 ravivaar ko hui team anna kii kor cameti kii baithak kaaphi hangaamedaar rahi
 The uproar began when the committee member Mufti Shamim Kasami was asked to leave the meeting
 team anna ne mufti par aarope lagaaya ki vah meeting main chal rahi baton kii recording kar rahe the
 Mufti, who came out of the meeting very angry, said that he has been wrongly accused, so he is separated from Anna's movement, and also said that Team Anna has been hijacked by Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia and they Running Team Anna like a dictator

 After a hundred years of development, when the news of market downturn scares us every day, every day job news is printed on the pages of the newspaper fearfully, covertly, beats by the falling lines of the stock market In the circumstances that are not going at a normal pace, should only the entire package of relief of the government be considered a proper treatment, as presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman two days ago and The Irte market trying to relieve

 On 25 August 1919, the British officer M

 In his letter to Combi, Gandhi said that Swadeshi meant for him to prepare and properly distribute the cloth that India needed
 isamen gharelu utpaadan ko protsaahit karnaa or logon ko yah shapath lene ke liye raji karnaa ki vah swadeshi hi pahanenge, or jitne videshi vastra hon, unhen jarurat hone par pahante rahen, unhen ekadam khaarij na karen
 Further, he thought that Swadeshi should not be limited to economic and religious aspects only
 vah usamen ucch naitik str ke rajnatik parinaamon kii sambhaavnaaen bhi dekh rahe the, jo us vakt kii sabase badi jarurat thi
 If you look at the time around this letter, you will understand the work around these ideas
 idhar sau saal ke vikaas ne hamen bataa diya he ki sab kuch behatar nahin he
 Even in the seventy years of independence, India has been left far behind in the imagination of Gandhi, which is marginalized, it has remained marginalized
 vaishvik bhukh suchakank main ham pite hue hai or hindustan kii kul daulat bhi chand haathon main he
 Education and health have almost reached the private sector, now the one who has the money, is available with good education and good treatment, otherwise
 samaveshi vikaas, antyoday keval bhaashanon main he, jamini paristhitiyon main bharat vaisaa bilkul nahin ho paaya he, jaisaa ho janaa chahie tha
 It is not just a matter of a few years or any political party
 yadi gandhi swadeshi main, charakhe main, ek aisa udyog dekh rahe the, jo krishi kaa poorak ho or usase rojgaar paidaa karne kii bhi paryaapt kshamta ho, usamen akaal jaisi sthitiyon se nipatane kaa hal bhi shaamil ho, us udyog kii haalat ham dekh rahe hai
 The condition of agriculture has reached such a point that being a farmer in India means being a helpless person, whose power is forgotten by feeding the lollipop of debt waiver every election year
 uski aay doguni karne kaa vaayada kiya jaataa he, par yah nahin bataaya jaataa ki vah hoga kaise
 Farmer suicides continue and farmers are largely excluded from agriculture
 aise main ek baar thaharkar gandhi kii swadeshi kii baton par sochna praasangik nahin ho jaataa
 At a time when even the US President is declaring to bring Chinese goods out of our country, can we think of anything different than giving a package to our country and society? aaj ke vakt main to yah or sambhav isliye bhi he, kyonki desh logon ke liye sarvopari he, rashtrawaad kii bhaavana chaaron ore bah rahi he or uskaa aitihaasik pratinidhitiv kar rahe hai narendra modi
 Modi ji made cleanliness historically an issue with Gandhi's spectacles, toilets were also installed in every village, should Swadeshi be taken a step ahead of cleanliness and no longer be considered indigenous in new contexts
 gandhi jise tamaam mushkilon kaa hal bataa rahe the or jise hamaari sattar saal kii aazaadee ne bhi thik tarah se nahin mana, kya ek baar vaisaa karke dekh liya jaae
 Certainly a few Gandhian organizations or people cannot do this, it will require a strong political will, that is possible at this time

 mamata ne kolkata ke nutoun main nae-navele kanvension centre main chauthe bengal global summit kaa aayojan kiya
 His presence was truly marquee

 The industrialists praised the Chief Minister a lot
 ambani to yah tak kah gaye, ''didi, aapke netritv main west bengal best bengal ban rahaa he
 "hiranandani said," above the super
 '' kotak ne kaha ki unhen yakeen ho gaya he ki desh ke bhavishya kaa purab main udai hoga
 a lot of promises were made at the summit, around Rs 2 lakh crore
 ke sahmati-patron (emoyu) or prastaavon par dastakhat hue
 In West Bengal too much happened during this time to claim

 ''lekin isamen kitni mahaj ummid he or kitni hakeekat? haalanki bijness summit main amuman vaade hi kiye jate hai lekin kuch prastaav aise hai jin par pashchim bengal ko sochane kii darkaar hogi
 For example, Sajjan Jindal's expansion of his JSW group was Rs 10,000 crore

 Promise of ambani ne bataaya ki rajya main jio ke liye unke praarambhik nivesh se 300 fisadi kaa laabh hua he
 In the case of the Jindal group, it is said that the Trinamool government threatened to invest on land acquired during the Left Front government to set up industries or face a situation like Singur
 (jeesdblyoo samooh kii ispaat utpaadan kii shuruaati yojana badalte kaarobaari maahaul main multavee ho gai thi)
 Despite this, some industrialization has started showing due to the efforts of the Trinamool government

 The historic victory that ended 34 years of Left Front rule was seen as the result of the Singur movement, where land for the Nano factory was acquired
 iskaa asar itnaa bheeshan tha ki udyog jagat ke kuch agua 2011 main yah soch rahe the ki kya vaaki udyog-kaarobaar kii duniya se bengal kaa naata tut jayega
 Consider the case of Infosys once again
 2008 main infosis ne rajarhat main 50 acre par esaijed viksit karne ke liye nivesh shuru kiya
 In 2011 the company invested Rs 75 crore
 ke nivesh kii jaankaree di lekin pariyojna thap ho gai kyonki mamata sarkaar ne kisi esaijed ko manjuuri dene se manaa kar diya
 Six years passed

 In her second term, Mamata is seen trying to create a pro-industry image
 masalan, 2018 ke bengal summit main mittal ke pahunchane kii ek vajah yah thi ki mamata ne landan daure ke dauraan nyotaa dene kii jimmedaari khud nibhaai thi
 In addition to praising Mamata Banerjee and her government at the summit, Mittal says, he had met the courtesy chief minister's house last month
 summit main mamata ne udyogpatiyon ko yah bharosa dilaane main koi kasar baaki nahin chodi ki bengal ke daravaaje kaarobaar ke liye khule hai
 He said, "bengal our beautiful home and consider us as ours
" aap hamaari sampatti hai, hamaari prerana hai, ham aapke bina kuch nahin hai—ham aapke bina kaamkaaj nahin chalaa sakate, na aage bache rah sakate hai
 Here the officers work as part of a large family and are always ready to help you
 yahaan na koi dabaav, na dhauns-pattee he, sirf prem or lagaav he
 "things may sound lukewarm but there was warmth in the atmosphere, there are no two opinions about it
" vaise, bengal global summit main udyogpatiyon ne nivesh ke bade-bade prastaav die hai, inamen menuphaccharing or infrastracchar, chote or majhole udyog, kapadaa sector, swasthya, paryaton, shiksha, khaadya prasanskaran or ity jaise mahatvapurn kshetra shaamil hai
 However, it remains to be seen how much Banerjee's industrialization efforts bring
 ab se unke kaarykaal ke ant tak bade paimaane par udyogon ke liye jameenka adhigrahan karnaa hoga
 The way of the Trinamool government is to buy land in government aid or trade
 isamen abhi bahut zyada shikaayatein nahin ai hai
 There are also signs that government policies are creating jobs
 brooking institution ke global metro monitor kaa akalan he ki 2013-14 main kolkata main rojgaar vruddhi 2
 5 percent, which was Delhi (3
 3 fisadi) ke alaava har metro shahar se zyada thi
 He was ranked 32nd in the index
 yah bhi dilli (18) se duusare sthaan par tha
 Nevertheless, despite all Mamata's efforts to boost the business environment in Bengal, the fear of unrest can create disappointment, as happened during the Darjeeling violence last year
 bijness summit main ambani ne iskaa zikr bhi kiya, ''(pashchim bengal main) audyogic chamatkaar isliye hua kyonki yahaan shanti or gatishiltaa he
 "perhaps for the purpose of giving a strong message, Mamata had another business summit a fortnight ago and this time in Darjeeling itself
" unhone is ilaake main paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye 100 karod ru
 Government investment announced
 yahaan nijee kshetra kii ore se 1,500 karod ru
 Investment proposal of yah bengal global summit ke mukaable bahut thodaa he
 But the event had a different purpose
 manch par mamata kii bagal main jijeem ke mukhiya vinay tamang baithe hue the or mamata ne vikaas kaaryon ke liye nivesh kaa vaada karke unase yah kahalava diya ki darjeeling kii paharipoon main ab hadtaal or anischitata kaa daur khatm ho gaya he
 That is, in Bengal, Mamta knows what works when

 agar aap neend puri nahin kar pate hai to iskaa asar exam par bhi dikh saktaa he

 sabase aakhir main magar sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki apane upar bharosa karnaa na choden
 Confidence is very important for exam success
 isliye pariksha main ghabaraae bina aatmavishvaas ke saath exam den
 The whole city was sleeping tabhi ek rocket dhire se shahar ke asaman main daakhil hua
 The rocket released a gas into the air over the city
 gas jameen par pahunchi or phir dekhte hi dekhte logon kii saanson main aisi ghuli ki saikadon saansen ruk gayi
 The date of humanity saw such a dreaded sight of death from the sky that the spectators of the bus watchers shivered
 insaanon ke banaae sabase khatarnaak or jaanaleva hathiyaar ko insaanon par hi aajamaaya ja rahaa tha or aajamaaish aisi ki minuton main laashon ke dher lag gaye
 No one knows when the storm that rained from the sky swallowed 13 hundred people in one stroke
 duniya ne rasinic bam kaa khoonkhaar cheharaa phir ek baar dekha
 Here the rocket released gas from the sky of Syria and on seeing it, hundreds of people died in the same moment
 aasmaan se barsi is sabase khaufnak maut ko barasaane kaa hukum kisi or ne nahin balki syria ke hi raashtrapati ne khud di thi
 In this world made by humans, their own leader was giving the order to drop this dreaded weapon, chemical bomb, made by humans at their own people
 shaq he ki duniya main sabase zyada rasinic hathiyaar isi syria ke paas he or syria kii avam philhal apane hi netaa ke khilaaf sadakon par he or usee sadak par avam kii aawaaj kuchalane ke liye usee avam ke leader aasmaan se unpar jehar barasaa rahe hai
 On August 21, 2013, at around 5 in the morning, when this country, which had been scorched in the fire of civil war for the last two years, opened its eyes on Wednesday morning, death was awaiting them
 idhar, ek ke baad ek rocket se shahriyon par kai hamale hue or udhar bastiyaan-dar-bastiyaan shmashaan main tabdeel hone lagi
 Innocent and oblivious people molested and started going to death
 kya bachche, kya buudhe or kya jawan, is hamale ne kisi ko nahin bakhsha
 Before people could understand what is this matter, if someone's breath stopped, then there was darkness in front of someone's eyes
 kyonki ye hamalaa koi maamuli hamalaa nahin, balki 1980 ke baad duniya main hua ab tak kaa sabase kufnaak rasaynic hamalaa tha
 The attack, which killed more than one and a half thousand people
 syria kii ek badi aabaadi vahaan ke raashtrapati bashar al asad ke khilaaf pichley lambey samay se sadakon par he lekin raashtrapati ke mukhalifat kii unhen aisi qeemat chukaani padegi, ye kisi ne khwaabon main bhi nahin sochaa tha
 It is alleged that at the behest of the government, the army fired rockets equipped with poisonous gases in the middle of the city and in the blink of an eye there was a furore in Damascus
 saalon se sahi-galat kii jang main uljhe syria ke logon ke liye goli-baari or dhamaake koi nai baat nahin hai lekin buudhvaar kii subah jo kuch hua, vaisaa isse pehle kabhi nahin hua tha
 People had just left their beds when the poisonous gas released from the rocket started to suffocate them
 is hamale kaa sabase pehla asar to yahi hua ki logon ko saans lene main dikkat hone lagi
 Darkness began to filter in front of the eyes due to burning sensation, the pupils started getting smaller and most of the people died within ten minutes of death
 sabase bura haal to bacchon kaa hua, jo kuch samajhane se pehle hi duniya se rukhsat ho gaye
 Those who were in a better condition started to make the hospital available to the sick people and on seeing it, they left all the cities of the city - big hospitals got flooded with the victims of chemical attack
 doctoron ke haath-paanv phool gaye
 The situation became such that it became difficult to understand whom to treat and whom to leave, and many more lives were silenced in this hurry
 syria kii ye hakeekat shaayad itani jaldi duniya ke saamne nahin aati, agar khud vahaan ke logon ne is tabaahi ke video soshal netwarking cites par aplod naa kiye hote
 Although it is not possible to present these videos till date, but the truth is that these videos have once again attracted the attention of the world towards Syria
 hawaii hamale or dhamaake syria kii jindagi kaa hissaa ban chuke hai lekin is baar is mulk ke hukmaranon ne apni hi awam ke khilaaf jis hathiyaar kaa istemaal kiya, usne laashon kii aisi or itani dher lagaai, jaisi haal ke dinon main kabhi nahin lagi thi
 The scene of death probably would not have been so terrible if the attackers had not used one of the world's most dangerous gases as a chemical weapon, and this gas was serine
 keval 30 se lekar 10 minute ke andar insaan ke puure nervas system ko bekaar karanevaali is gas ko duniya main maut ke duusare naam se janaa jaataa he
 The peculiarity of this gas without any color and smell is that it is heavier than air and that is why once this gas dissolves in Fiza, there is no way for a person to escape
 is baar jab damishq or uske aas-paas rocketon ke jariye isi cerin gas kaa hamalaa kiya gaya, to maasoom logon ne bachane ke liye wo tarika chun liya, jo isse pehle wo aksar chunaa karte the or ye tarika tha, underground hona
 That is, hiding inside the ground in a basement, but this ignorance of people proved to be the cause of death for them
 vajani hone kii vajah se cerin gas badi aasaani se basament main chhipe logon tak ja pahunchi or logon ke liye khud unheen ke thikaane gas chember sabit hue
 At first, people did not understand what happened, but by the time the gas started to show effect, people did not get a chance to recover
 haalat ye ho gai ki keede-makodon kii tarah insaan maut ke munh main samaane lage
 The worst case was that of women and children, and many doctors who treated people were killed in this attack
 haalat itani karaab ho gai ki jin doctoron par logon kii jindagi dene kii jimmedaari thi, unamem se kai to maut kaa manjar dekh kar khud hi rone lage
 a doctor told that he himself raised the corpses of about 50 children with his own hands
 cerin naam ke is kufnaak gas kii ek khaas baat ye thi ki isse upree taur par jism main koi nishaan nahin dikh rahaa tha, lekin andar se yahi gas saikadon logon ke liye maut kii vajah ban gai
 Starting from Damascus, this quorum had now taken the whole of Syria into its fold
 kisi ko saans lene main dikkat thi, kisi kii ankhon kii putaliya choti ho rahi thim or kisi kaa puraa badan akad rahaa tha
 This was the effect of the most frightening chemical attack in Syria in recent years
 wo hamalaa jise khud sarkaar ne apane hi logon ke khilaaf kiya
 When the opposition parties accused the use of chemical weapons for the first time against the Assad government of Syria, the world did not believe it easily, but as soon as these videos were uploaded on social sites, the whole world came into disarray
 landan ke cranfield forensik institute ke visiting phelo steefan johnson ne jab damishq ke in video ko baariki se dekha, to unhen laga ki insaan ke aise halaat sirf nervas system ke kharaab hone par hi ho saktaa he or rasinic hamale ke maamle main mumkin he
 By the way experts are talking about the serine gas, how dangerous it is, it can only be gauged by the fact that the death of a human being is possible when even one ounce of it falls into the body
 ilaaj nahin hone par mahaj 10 minute par iske shikaar shaks kii maut ho sakati he
 May suffocate and even kill a person paralyzed
 ab jaahir he, jab hamalaa itnaa kaufanaak he, to use lekar duniya kaa baichaiyn hona laazmi he or is hamale ke baad khud sanyukt raashtra sangh ne bhi is maamle ko behad gambhirtha se liya he or ab puure maamle par najar rakh rahi he

 unhone kaha, "jaahir he ki koi press main aisi khabaren de rahaa he taaki court ko isse prabhavit kiya ja sake
 Both divorce cases are in the court and settlement has to be made for alimony
 kya yah sambhav he ki 26 saalon tak shaadishuda jindagi bitaane ke baad ek vyakti ko ahsaas ho ki uski shaadi kaa koi matlab nahin he? ham aisi khabaron se chintit nahin hai, court apana faisla un sabooton ke aadhaar par legi jo unke saamne prastut kiye gaye hai
 " kanika ne pinkavila se aage kaha, "mujhe nahin pataa ki meri bahan ne deepak tijori se shaadi se pehle talaak liya yaa nahin
 If that person (shivani's first husband) is also married, does her marriage also have any meaning? All this is rubbish

 He said, "obviously someone is giving such reports in the press so that the court can be influenced by it
" donon ke talaak kaa maamla court main he or guzaara bhatte ke liye setlement bhi hona he
 Is it possible that after 26 years of married life, a person realizes that his marriage has no meaning? We are not concerned with such reports, the court will take its decision based on the evidence that has been presented before them
 " Kanika further told Pinkvilla, "I don't know if my sister divorced Deepak Tijori before marriage

 After meeting a lot of people who bought flats in the National Capital Region, the Congress vice-president who surrounded the government on the issue of land acquisition and farmers said that they have understood that it is not only the farmers and tribals but the middle class man also on land issues grinding up
 flats khariddaaron ke saath khadey hone kaa aashwaasan dete hue rahul gandhi ne kaha ki paardarshita ke abhaav ke chalate flats kharidne waalon ko adhar main chhod diya gaya he
 According to Rahul, he was told that he would get flats on a fixed day but he did not get flats for years
 unhen bataaya gaya tha ki flats kaa super dupar aria bahut adhik hoga lekin jo diya gaya he vah kuch alag he
 Rahul Gandhi said that someone had been promised that the flat would look good but after a few months of getting the flat, a new building was erected and the view disappeared
 congress netaa ne kaha ki sarkaar us vidheyak ko dhwast karne kii koshish kar rahi he jo congress kii aguwai vaali UPA sarkaar real estate sector ke niyaman ke liye lekar ai thi
 Rahul Gandhi said, the main drawback has been that there was complete transparency
 karpet aria jis par aap hastakshar karte hai , vahi aapako milegaa
 They diluted it and made it buyer-friendly in favor of the builder
 sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue unhone kaha, 'yah jo kisaanon or adivaasiyon ke khilaaf kar rahi he , vahi kaam madhyam varg ke khilaaf kar rahi he
 'rahul Gandhi said,' i have assured them that the way i have stood with the farmers and tribals, i will also be with them

 input: bhashaa Recently, in the face of competition from Reliance Jio and the rest of the private companies, recently BSNL had changed the plans with a lot of aggressiveness and also launched new plans
 sarkari telecom company ne apane plance ke saath OTT services ke free sabsakripshan ko bhi dena shuru kiya tha
 Along with this, additional data was also being given to customers along with BSNL prepaid plans
 haalanki ab company ne ek aisa kadam uthaaya he, jo shaayad graahakon ko raas nahin aayega
 According to the report of telecomtalk, now some customers of BSNL will not get unlimited calling service
 praapt jaankaree ke mutabik BSNL ke 186 rupee, 429 rupee, 485 rupee, 666 rupee or 1,699 rupee vaale preeped plan main ab analimited colling kaa phayda graahakon ko nahin milegaa
 However, instead of this, customers will get 250 minutes of free calling daily
 yani graahak kareeb kareeb ek din main saadhe chaar ghante ke aasapaas graahak baat kar paaenge
 After crossing the limit of 250 minutes in calling, users will be charged at the rate of 1 paise per second
 ye midnite tak ke liye hoga
 After that, as soon as the new day starts, again users will be able to take advantage of 250 minutes calling
 dhyaan rahe agar yugers 250 colling minutes ko puri tarah istemaal nahin kar pate hai to ye aage forverd nahin hoga
 As a reminder, realsun Jio was the first company to start unlimited calling in its plans
 jeeyo ke baad analimited colling kaa phayda BSNL, airtel or vodaphone idia jaisi baaki companiyon dwaara bhi diya jane laga
 Now FUP has been imposed on unlimited calling by BSNL, it will be interesting to see what steps other companies take
 iske alaava aapako bataa den BSNL ne haal hi main apane abhinandan-151 preeped plan main badlaav kiya tha
 After the change, now 500MB additional data is being given by BSNL in this prepaid plan of Rs 151
 yani ab is plan main graahakon ko roj 1
 5GB of data is being provided
 company ne is plan kii validity main koi badlaav nahin kiya he
 Customers will get 24 days validity as before
 launch ke vakt is plan main company dwaara roj maatr 1GB data diya ja rahaa tha

 ananyaa mukherjee ke shabdon main kahen to ‘jab mujhe pataa chalaa ki mujhe brast cancer he, main vishwaas nahin kar saki
 This news shook me deep inside
 lekin, jald hi maine apane aatmavishvaas ko sametakar apane ko majboot kiya
 i knew that everything would be alright
 
 
 ’ lekin pehali baar hua ki wo bhavishya ke andheron se jeet nahin pai
 Remember that when Ananya, the author of this book, was fighting the biggest battle of her short life, she was neither disappointed nor did she give up
 unhone apni jindagi ko puri jindadilii se jiya
 But Ananya Mukherjee lost her battle with cancer at a very young age
 wo ab hamaare bich nahin hai
 Ananya Mukherjee spent her childhood in Nagpur and Delhi, where she attended college
 unhone simbyosis college, pune se maas communication main snatakottar kii padhai kii, or ve apane batch kii topper thim
 She went to the University of Wollongong, Australia to pursue a postgraduate education in journalism
 apane satraa saal ke peshewar jivan main unhone kai jaani-maani piaar companiyon or korporate companiyon ke saath kaam kiya, jinamein korporate voyas, good relations, ingersol rand or daalamia bharat group shaamil hai
 After their marriage in 2012, she moved to Jaipur, which became her second home
 2016 main pataa chalaa ki ananyaa ko stan cancer tha, jab unka ilaaj chal rahaa tha to unhone cancer se jude apane anubhavon or sangharsh ke bare main likhnaa shuru kar diya, jo is kitaab ke rup main saamne hai
 Despite going through more than fifty sessions of chemotherapy, Ananya woke up with words
 yah kitaab un logon ke jivan main ummid kii kiran kii tarah ho sakati he, jinako cancer he or unke parijanon tathaa dekhbhaal karne waalon ke liye bhi jo mariz ke saath-saath is beemaari ko anubhav kar rahe hote hai
 Just 18 days before he died, the writer submitted the manuscript to the publisher, which is now in public form in the form of a book
 cancer jaisi ghaatak bimaari se jujh chuki mashhur abhinetri manisha koirala evam cricketer yuvaraj singh ne is pustak ko padhakar apni pratikriya main lekhika ke cancer se ladane ke adbhut saahas evam bahaduree kii saraahna kii he
 Manisha says, "the story of Ananya fighting cancer tells the way of living"
 vahiin yuvaraj singh kehete hai, "kaash main ananyaa se milakar unhen bataa saktaa ki unhone kitni khubsuurati se cancer se ladaai kii kahani is kitaab main likhi he"
 a day before the social activist Anna Hazare's fast, a committee was formed to elect the Lokpal
 centre kii modi sarkaar dwaara gathit 8 sadasyeey samiti ne mangalvaar ko apni pehali baithak kii
 Let us know that Anna Hazare will sit on a fast in his village Ralegan Siddhi in Ahmed Nagar district of Maharashtra at 10 am
 unhone centre sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki lokapal kanoon bane 5 saal ho gaye or narendra modi sarkaar paanch saal tak bahanebaaji karti rahi
 He said that if it was in the heart of the Narendra Modi government, would it have been necessary to take 5 years? Officials said that it is understood that the committee headed by former Supreme Court Judge Ranjan Prakash Desai appointed the Lokpal chief and its members
 Discussed modalities related to
 baithak se kuch din pehle ucchtam nyaayalay ne is samiti ke liye un naamon kaa panel bhejne ke liye farvari ke ant tak kii samay seemaa tay kii thi, jin naamon par modi nit chayan samiti dwaara lokapal ke adhyaksh or sadsy ke rup main niyukt karne ke liye vichaar kiya ja sake
 On January 17, the Supreme Court had asked the name-suggesting committee to complete its deliberations and recommend the list of names of candidates for the Lokpal chairperson and members by the end of February
 bataa den ki kuch khaas shrenee ke loksevakon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamalon par gaur karne ke liye centre main lokapal tathaa rajyon main lokayuktaon kii niyukti kii vyavastha karne vaala lokapal kanoon 2013 main paarit hua tha

 Panwar and Ranjit Kumar are the other members of the committee
 ek varisht sarkari adhikari ke mutabik naam sujhane vaali samiti kaa gathan congress netaa mallikarjun khadge dwaara uthaai chintaaon ko nazarandaaj karte hue kiya gaya
 Explain that Kharge has been boycotting the selection committee meetings on the grounds that he has not been made a full member of the committee
 khadge pichley saal chah maukon par chayan samiti kii baithkon main ‘vishesh atithi’ ke taur par shaamil hone ke liye bheje gaye nyote ko khaarij kar chuke hai
 Significantly, according to the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha will be a member of the selection committee
 chunki, mallikarjun khadge ko yah darja hasil nahin he, isliye vah samiti kaa hissaa nahin hai

 India's Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj told Pushpakmal Dahal Prachanda, Leader of the Opposition in Nepal, "the future of the LOP (leader of the Opposition) is always bright
" ” swaraj ne maovadi netaa prachand ko samvidhan ke nirmaan kii prakriya ke prati patibaddh rahane kii salaah di, jo nai samvidhan sabha ke tahat nae sire se shuru kii gai he
 Swaraj was stating that she was met by then Sri Lankan opposition leader Ranil Wickramasinghe when she was the Minister of Information and Broadcasting in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government
 us samay vikramsinghe ne unase aisa hi kaha tha
 Swaraj said that soon after that meeting, Wickremesinghe won the next election and became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka
 phir unhone prachand ko bhutan ke pradhanmantri tshering tobge ke bare main bataaya, jo unase vipaksh ke netaa ke taur par mili the
 Insiders say that after giving Swaraj his example, he joked that if Prachanda does not become Prime Minister again, then he can expect to become a foreign minister like him himself
 chunaav main apni party ko mili karaari haar ke anubhav se ubarne main lage maovadi netaa prachand ko ye baaten bhale hi kisi sabak jaisi lagi hon, lekin vaastaviktaa yah he ki vipaksh main rahane ke phaaydon ko bataane ke liye swaraj se behatar koi doosraa vyakti nahin ho saktaa tha
 The purpose of all these things was to encourage Prachanda to play a positive role in the Constituent Assembly and Nepali Parliament, because Prachanda has all the responsibility to bring other Maoist organizations on one platform

 It was a political economy that thrived on instability and believed that this instability would become the lifestyle of India and Nepal

 Suddenly the political executive in India is completely controlled
 ab koi bhi cabinet mantri agar koi sandesh detaa he, to uskaa apana mahatv hota he, khaskar agar vah loktantric dhaanche main kisi sabak se sambandhit ho
 That is why what Prime Minister Narendra Modi will say to the Constituent Assembly during his visit to Nepal next week, will now be very important in deciding the direction of our relationship with our neighbor

 But both sides could not reach an opinion on the conditions for setting up the Pancheshwar Development Authority

 The reason for this delay was mainly lack of political will, but now that political will is strong, because Delhi has a strong government

 In the wake of the controversy over the alleged West Bengal government's alleged ban on writer Salman Rushdie from visiting Kolkata recently, Sultan Ahmad, a senior Congress leader and former Union minister, has said that Rushdie and Taslima Nasreen will never be allowed to enter the state in future too
 Will go
 sultan ahamed ne kaha ki salmaan rushdi ke bare main rajya sarkaar kaa faisla bengal kii janata kii bhaavana ke anusaar tha
 On 30 January, controversial writer Salman Rushdie was reportedly barred from visiting Kolkata
 vahaan unhen ‘kolakata sahitya baithak’ main hissaa lenaa tha
 Rushdie later accused Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of forcibly preventing her from going to Kolkata
 ise baat ko lekar bada vivaad khadaa hua tha
 Earlier in 2012, he could not attend the Jaipur Literature Festival due to opposition from Muslim organizations
 isi bare main trinmul netaa or loksabhaa sadsy ahamed ne kaha, ‘rajya sarkaar kaa faisla (rushdi ko rokane kaa) bilkul jaays tha
 This was in line with the sentiments of the people of Bengal
 ’sultan ahamed ne kaha, ‘bengal kii janata rushdi or tasalima nasrin ko nahin pasand karti
 Both of these are 'undaunted' (unwanted) in our state
 bankimchandra, sharathchandra or rabindranath kii dharti par in logon ko kabhi nahin aane diya jayega
 'the entire controversy was bolstered when Rushdie tweeted,' We were informed that Kolkata Police will not allow the city to enter
 agar main vahaan jaataa to mujhase agali udaan se waapas jane ke liye kah diya jaataa
 i was told that this was done at the behest of the Chief Minister (mamta)
 ’rushdi ke 1988 main aae upanyaas ‘da satanic varses’ ko lekar muslim sanghathan unka virodh karte hai
 It was in this context that Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa against Rushdie in 1989

 Muslim organizations oppose this
 isi vivaad ke chalate unhen bangladesh chhodana padaa tha or kai saal vah kolkata main raheen, lekin muslim sanghathanon ke virodh ke kaaran unhen yah shahar bhi chhodana padaa

 warirs ko apane antim match main royal chalangers ke haathon mili 130 ranon kii karaari shikast ko bhulaakar nae sire se shuruyaat kerani hogi
 Warriors all-rounder Sean Marsh said on the eve of the match that his team was more likely to win
 marsh kaa yah vishwaas nishchit taur par dairedevills ke haal ke pradarshan par aadhaarit he, lekin vah bhi acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki unki team ke liye jeet kii raah aasaan nahin he
 The comments warirs ne apni aakhri jeet 15 april ko chennai super kings ke khilaaf darj kii thi
 This team will have to perform exactly the same way to return to the winning track but for this they will have to stop some of the daredevils
 virendra sahvaag, david warner, mahela jayavardhane or manpreet juneja ko rokane main agar warirs ke gendbaaj safal rahe to uske ballebaaj kuch shandaar karishma karte hue apni team ko lagaataar paanchavin haar se bachaa sakate hai
 For this, however, the Warriors will have to make a common effort, which seems a bit difficult after the morale-breaking defeat against Royal Challengers

 The Warriors will have to start afresh in their final match, losing the 130-run defeat at the hands of Royal Challengers
 warirs ke harfanmaulaa khilaadi shaun marsh ne match purv sandhya par kaha ki unki team ke jeetne kii sambhaavna zyada he
 Marsh's belief is certainly based on the recent performance of the Daredevils, but he is also well aware that the path to victory for his team is not easy
 tippaniyan The Warriors recorded their last win against Chennai Super Kings on 15 April
 is team ko phir se jeet kii patari par lautne ke liye bilkul vaisaa hi pradarshan karnaa hoga lekin iske liye use dairedevills ke kuch dhurandharon par roak lagaani hoga
 If the Warriors bowlers are successful in stopping Virender Sehwag, David Warner, Mahela Jayawardene and Manpreet Juneja, then their batsmen can do some great charisma to save their team from a fifth consecutive defeat
 iske liye haalanki warirs ko ek saajha prayaas karnaa hoga, jo royal chalangers ke khilaaf mili manobal todane vaali haar ke baad thodaa mushkil lag rahaa he

 com / scjme1pgcd — ANI UP (@aninewsup) December 21, 2018 It is known that before this, BJP MLA Bukkal Nawab made a controversial statement about the caste of Bhinuman
 unhone kaha ki hanuman muslim the
 Therefore, the names of Muslims are placed on Rahman, Ramadan, Farhan, Suleiman, Salman, Zishan, Qurbaan
 bijepi vidhayak bukkal nawab ne hanuman ko dalit bataae jane ke vivaad kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki hanuman kii jati par baat hoti he
 So it should also be seen from which religion he belonged
 meraa maananaa he ki hanuman ji muslim the
 Therefore, the name that is given inside Muslims is similar to Hanuman
 yahi nahin, unhone aage kaha ki, 'lakhanu main kai musalamaanon ne hanuman ke mandir bhi banawaye hai
 Our family has also built temples of Hanuman
 maine khud hanuman ji kii puja-archana kii he
 Therefore, i believe that Hanuman was a Muslim

 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, while addressing an election rally in Alwar, Rajasthan on 27 November, described Hanuman as a Dalit
 unhone kaha tha ki hanuman vanavaasi, vanchit or dalit the
 Following his statement, there was fierce opposition in the political corridors across the country
 yogi ke bayaan ke baad lagi hanuman kii jati bataane kii hode
 
 
 On November 30, Lord Hanuman was declared tribal by National Scheduled Tribes Commission (NCST) chairman Nand Kumar Sai after CM Yogi's statement about Hanuman Kodalit
 vahiin, baba ramdev ne khud ko rambhakt bataate hue kaha tha ki hanuman asht siddhi ke gyani hone ke saath-saath kshatriya bhi hai
 Not only this, Union Minister Satyapal Songh called Hanuman not Dalit but Arya Toshankaracharyaswami Swaroopanand Saraswati called him a Brahmin
 bijepi netaa or rajyasabha saansad gopal narayan singh ne to yah tak kah diya ki hanuman to bandar the or bandar pashu hota he, jiskaa darja dalit se bhi neeche hota he
 Rama made him a god
 iske alaava acharya nirbhay sagar ne hanuman ko jain bataaya
 He argued to prove this, saying that since Hanuman accepted the non-violence religion of Jainism, he did not wage a violent war and hence this proves that Hanuman was a Jain

 BJP and Congress are leaving no stone unturned to win the 'battle of votes' to be held on these dates
 donon partiyon ke bich donon rajyon main aamane-saamne kii sidhi ladaai he, isliye matadaataaon ko lubhaane ke liye har daanv aajamaaya ja rahaa he
 On the field, where Congress and BJP veteran leaders are united day and night in the campaign, on the social media too, 'creative Surma' of both parties are throwing their all to win in the 'mindgame'
 soshal media par ‘vakyuddh’main twitor ahm manch bana hua he
 On each other's Twitter handles are also getting hit directly and directly
 vahiin parde ke peeche se bhi proxi war ke jariye ek-duusare kii taang khinchaai main koi kasar nahin chodi ja rahi
 a lot of 'un-official' is also happening on social media
 jaise kisoshal mediaper haal main dikhaai de rahi ek tasviir main rahul gandhi ko ‘bahubali’ke andaaj main dikhaaya gaya he
 In the picture, Rahul has a black dustbin on his shoulder
 is koodaydaan ke baahar ‘camel’ bana hua he or uske bheetar ‘hairaan pareshaan’ narendra modi, amit shah or arun jetali kii tasviren hai
 Along with 'sach Bharat Abhiyan', the picture also has the caption - 'one step towards cleanliness'
 yahi nahin tasviir main rahul kandhe vaale koodaydaan ko lekar ek bade koodaydaan kii ore badhate dikh rahe hai jis par likhaa he ‘2014 kaa kooda yahaan daalen’
 The interesting thing is that the Congress has not shared this picture from its Twitter or Facebook page
 magar apratyaksh taur par ye tasviir soshal media par dhadlle se share hoti najar aa rahi he
 Not only this, another video is also going viral
 isamen modi kii ek tasviir logon ko dikhaai ja rahi he jisame ve kaala chashma pahane dikh rahe hai
 In this video shot abroad, people are being asked, what do they think who is this person? Those who are being asked are unaware of Prime Minister Modi and are speculating who this person could be
 This video is being shared through supporters through proxy war
 soshal media par is tarah ke prahaar sirf ek taraf se hi nahin ho rahe
 There is no shortage of social media for those who targeted the Congress party and its vice president Rahul Gandhi
 proxi war ke tahatgujrat chunaavako lekar ek aisa hi video share kiya ja rahaa he
 In this video, Rahul Gandhi has been shown as 'gabbar Singh'
 ye video rahul gandhi kii ore se GST ko ‘gabbar singh tex’ bataane ke baad aayaa he
 In this video, it is shown that Rahul is grabbing three comrades (hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakor and Jignesh Mevani) like Gabbar
 saath hi kah rahe hai ki wo do the (video main vijay roopaani or nitin patel kii photo dikhaai detii he) or tum teen, phir bhi waapas aa gaye
 After this, Narendra Modi can be seen loudly in the video
 ye baat duusari he ki ye saavdhaanee barti ja rahi he ki soshal media par donon partiyon yaa inke netaaon ke jo aupchaarik handle yaa pej hai, vahaan sidhe taur par aise tanj kasne se bachaa jaae
 Officially Congress says that the public is fighting the fight against BJP on social media
 congress pravaktaa ajay kumaar ke hisaab se ‘soshal media ab ek hakeekat he, desh kii aam janata ab twitor ho yaa fasebuk, ab pehle se zyada active he
 His mind is filled with listening to the false assurances of Modi government and Modi ji
 3 saal ho gaye or pradhanmantri ab bhicongress par nishanasaadh rahe hai
 Tell me what you did in 3 years
 ye proxi war janata lard rahi he
 'ajay Kumar also says that the election starts with the announcement of election dates
 soshal media ke jariye idia share kiye jate hai
 Any medium used to enhance the message in the right way is important
 ajay kumaar ne ye bhi kaha ki bijepi soshal media ke madhyam se jhooth yaa aadha sach naa failaae, ye kisi rashtriya party kii chhavi ko lekar sahi sandesh nahin detaa
 BJP leaders did not say anything about what is happening un-officially on social media
 lekin ye jataana nahin bhuule ki soshal media par unke aadhikarik plateform jo video or clips dikhaae ja rahe hai unako logon se jabardast rispons mil rahaa he
 bjp's digital media head Amit Malviya says
 ‘aap andaja nahin laga sakate ki hamen soshal media par kis tarah kaa rispons mil rahaa he
 This is because the party has been serving in Gujarat for years
 hamane gujarati or hindi donon main video banaae hai
 We are breaking the monotony and making non-traditional clips
 ’bijepi pravaktaa jiviel narsimha ne kaha ki pichley kuch varshon se media ke alag-alag plateforms yaa watsoep ne raajnneetik sandeshon kaa prasar karne main madad di he
 In such a situation, it is natural that political parties should use all online media platforms and do new experiments on the social space
 makapa ke mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne sabarimala maamle main kerala kii vam morcha sarkaar ke ravaiye ko sharmnaak bataane vaale pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kathith bayaan kii ninda karte huye kaha he ki yah ucchtam nyaayalay kii avmaananaa he or sarvocch adaalat ko is par swat: sangyaan lenaa chahie
 On Tuesday, Modi criticized Kerala's CPI (M) -led LDF government and Congress-led opposition UDF on the issue of women's entry into Sabarimala
 modi ne kaha tha ki ldf or udief, donon ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai
 At the same time, the state government argues that by implementing the decision of the Supreme Court in this case, the government is discharging its constitutional obligation
 yechuri ne twit kar kaha ‘‘kam se kam ucchtam nyaayalay ko ab modi dwaara kii gayi adaalat kii avmaananaa par swat:sangyaan lenaa chaiye
 Rule of law should be effective, not rule of crowd
 ham ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh se bandhe hai
 "yechury took such oath as a shameful statement for a person sitting on the post of Prime Minister by taking oath of constitution
" isse pehle buudhvaar ko makapa paulitte beuro kii ore se bhi jari bayaan main kaha gaya he, ‘‘kerala ke kolum main pradhanmantri ne ek jansabha main kathith taur par kaha ki sabarimala maamle main ldf sarkaar kaa rukh ‘sharmnaak' he
 This statement is highly condemnable
 yah us sarkaar ko dhikkarna he jo ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle ko lagu karne main lagi he
 Accusing Modi of speaking the language of an RSS pracharak, the Politburo said, "prime Minister Modi has forgotten that he has sworn in the Constitution of India
" unka yah bayaan samvidhan or ucchtam nyaayalay par sidhaa hamalaa he
 '' maharashtra, haryana or punjab jaise rajyon ke kisaan anuvanshik ejineering se durust kiye gaye fasalon (jiem) ko ugane ke liye sangharsh kar rahe hai
 He argues that it costs less to grow, yields are high and they are also less prone to attack by pests and weeds
 sarkaar ne jiem coton (kapaas) kii ek prajati ko chhodkar baaki jiem fasalon par pabandi laga rakhi he
 But answering a question in Parliament on 19 July, the government said that there is no scientific evidence that these crops are not suitable for human consumption
 haalanki isse jiem fasalon par puri pabandi kaa maamla feet nahin baithta, lekin paryaavaran ko lekar chintit log or kuch kisaanon ke samooh bhi, kehete hai ki sarkaar is masale par aise adhyayanon ko nazarandaaj kar rahi he jo jiem fasalon kii paidaavaar ko sehat ke nuksaan se jodakar dekhte hai
 Environmentalists say that the use of GM food can also cause cancer
 ab sawaal yah bhi he ki kya anuvanshik ejineering se taiyaar fasalein sehat kii liye thik he yaa nahin, is par nigaah koun rakhega
 Or, with the desire to achieve higher yields in agriculture, we should take care of environment and health concerns
 iske bainks ek sawaal yah paidaa hota he ki jiem fasalein badalte paryaavaran or jalwaayu parivartan ke daur main mufeed sabit ho sakati hai or isse badhati aabaadi kaa pet bhi bharaa ja saktaa he
 In fact, 17 years have passed since BT Cotton was approved
 yah ekmaatr jiem fasal he jise bharat main ugane kii kanoonee manjuuri mili hui he
 However, BT Brinjal (brinjal) and GM Mustard have also been given government approval in 2017
 pichhali july main maharashtra main 12 kisaanon ko sarkari bandish kaa ulanghan karte hue giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 These farmers were using GM cotton seeds without approval
 is babat, 60 exiar darj kiye gaye or 1100 kilogram gaiyrkanoonee beej bhi jabt kiya gaya tha
 Significantly, there is a provision of five years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1 lakh for growing illegal GM crops
 yahaan dhyaan dene vaali baat he ki desh main saal 2017-18 main 62 lakh metric ton kapaas kii paidaavaar hui thi
 This yield was significantly higher than in China
 china main 60 lakh metric ton, america main 46 lakh metric ton, brazil main 19 lakh metric ton or pakistan main 18 lakh metric ton kapaas ugaaya gaya
 11 in 2017-18 from India
 3 lakh metric ton kapaas kaa niryaat kiya gaya tha
 India is far behind the US in terms of exports
 america main 34
 5 lakh metric tons of cotton was exported that year
 bharat kapaas kaa aayaat karne main puri duniya main saatven paaydaan par he jahaan 3,70,000 metric ton kapaas kaa aayaat kiya gaya
 Nearly 1 area of cotton cultivation in the country 17 karod hectare he
 That is, 37 of the land in which cotton is grown worldwide
 5 fisadi khet bharat main he
 65 lakh cotton farmers and 10 million people from 10 states of the country earn their bread from cotton related work
 desh ke kapaas paidaa karne vaale ilaakon main se 15 fisadi ilaake maharasht, gujarat, andhra pradesh or telugana main hai jahaan gaiyr-kanoonee jiem kapaas (2017-18 main) ugaai gai thi
 There was an advantage of about 2800 to 5000 rupees per hectare
 coton esocysan of india ke mutabik, saal 2010 se 2015 ke bich prati hectare 73,200 rupee kii ausat aamadani kapaas ugane vaale kisaanon ko hui thi
 Whereas the average cost per hectare for growing cotton was Rs 63,941 during the same period

 sanyukt raashtra pramukh ne jecipioe main shaamil deshon se unki patibaddhta ko kaayam rakhane or anya sadsy deshon se samjhaute ko samarthan dene kaa aahvaan kiya he

 whatsapp ek aisa instent miseging ap he jiske duniya bhar main 1
 There are more than 5 billion active users
 log watsap par bharosa karte hai
 Can Whatsapp be hacked? This question is in almost everyone's mind
 company ise sicyor banaaya he or and tu and ancripshan de kar iske chats ko bhi sicyor kiya he
 Many people also feel that whatsapp cannot be hacked
 lekin aisa nahin he or watsap hack ho sakate hai
 But this is a little tricky
 kai baar aapke watsap ke miseges koi or pard rahaa hota he, lekin aapako is baat kii khabar nahin hoti
 It is possible that your smartphone will have whatsapp and you use it the most
 isliye aapako sef or sicyor rahane kii jarurat he
 We tell you what to do and what not to do for it
 aapako ye pataa hoga ki ek number se sirf ek hi smartphone main watsap chalaaya ja saktaa he
 You cannot run a whatsapp in two phones under any circumstances
 haalanki aap ek saath computer or mobile main ek hi watsap chalaa sakate hai
 Through whatsapp web, you can scan QR code and run whatsapp on web and mobile
 is tareeke se aapkaa watsap hack bhi hota he
 whatsapping can sometimes happen in just a few seconds
 aapane kuch samay ke liye kisi ko phone diya or wo aapke watsap ko ek tul ke jariye scan karke saare chats or real time massej hack kar saktaa he
 The reason for this is just the whatsapp web option
 doosraa tarika ye he ki aapkaa mobile number watsap main register karke use actevet karne ke baad aapaki puri chat history ricover kii ja sakati he
 There are many tricks for this, such as the code sent by whatsapp can be called from customer care by calling fraud, which is also found in many cases
 iske liye havers wais massej kaa bhi sahaara lete hai
 To check that your whatsapp is not being run anywhere else, you can go to the whatsapp settings
 yahaan watsap web dikhegaa jise open kar sakate hai
 If whatsapp is open somewhere, then its information will be shown here
 yahaan se aap Sessions and kar sakate hai
 If you have written this phone could not be verified, then you can confirm here
 agar aapako yahaan dikhaa ki koi or seshan chaalu he to use tatkaal and karen
 According to whatsapp, it takes 90 days to delete whatsapp data
 haalanki is dauraan aap inhen acces nahin kar sakate
 After finishing the session, you can go to Settings and delete whatsapp
 30 din tak diactevet rahane ke baad aapkaa acount delit ho jayega
 To register again one has to follow the start process again
 koi doosraa aapke number se aapkaa watsap yuj na kare iske liye karen ye badlavvotsap main privesi settings he jiske liye aapako pascode set karnaa hota he
 It can also be called two step authentication
 ise actevet karne ke liye settings me ja kar acount par tap karen
 Here the option of Enable 2 Step-verification will be found
 ise actevet kar len
 Here you have to set the passcode, enter the email id
 ab agar koi doosraa aapako number se watsap acount banayega or agar usne kisi tarah se aapse veriphication code bhi le liya to bina privesi password ke watsap open nahin kar paaegaa

 ovel offis main guuruuvaar ko dakshin korian raashtrapati moon jei-in ke saath baatcheet main trump ne kaha ki ham uttar korea or kim jong un ke saath aage kii sambhavit baithkon ke bare charchaa karenge
 At the same time, in his speech during the session of North Korea's parliament, Kim said that the summit with Trump in February failed because the US had kept unilateral demands, but his relationship with the President of the United States was better
 shuukravaar ko pyongyang kii aadhikarik korean central news agency ne bataaya ki kim state afares kamishan ke dobaaraa adhyaksh chune gaye hai or faisle lene ke maamle main yah desh kii top unit he
 At the same time, the US had stated that the reason behind the failure of this summit was that North Korea was seeking great relief from sanctions, but wanted to take limited disarmament steps instead
 bataa den ki june 2018 main singapore main hui trump or kim ke bich pehali shikhar vaarta kaamyaab rahi thi
 The second summit was held in Hanoi in February 2019, however, no agreement could be reached between the two countries
 ab donon deshon ke netaaon ke bich teesri shikhar vaarta hone kii sambhaavna he
 Both Donald Trump and Moon Jae-in are trying their best to resolve the matter through talks with North Korea, but the failure of the summit in Vietnam was a setback for both countries, leaving no one to recover yet

 Coal Minister Jaiswal made a mockery of Manmohan Singh indirectly at the Congress trade union organization meeting held in Lucknow and said that Sonia and Rahul make the Prime Minister
 isliye ve is kursi ke peeche nahin bhaagate
 He can make anyone prime minister for 10 years
 jaiswal kaa raag darbari yaheen nahin rukaa

 agar jaiswal ko lagata he ki sonia or rahul kisi ko bhi piem bana sakate hai, to puri congress modi phobia se pareshaan kyon he
 Questioning Manmohan Singh's name, Annibadi Hayaswal's political philosophy, Vajpayee said that Congress ministers do not respect their Prime Minister
 vah unhen anebadi (koi bhi) kahkar bulaate hai
 He feels that only Sonia and Rahul are above every constitutional post and deserves respect

 haal hi main jari 'whot da dak sho-3' main sachin tendulkar or virendra sahvaag ne apane jamaane ke kai mjedaar anubhav share kiye hai
 Master blaster Sachin has also mentioned Pakistani veteran inzamam-ul-haq during the show
 unhone injamaam kii tarif karte hue kaha ki vah bhartiya khilaadiyon se kaaphi izzat or pyaar ke saath baaten karte the
 During this, Sachin narrated an interesting incident
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe yaad he jab ham pakistan ke daure par the, to lahore main pakistan kii team ke baad hamaara net practice shuru hone vaala tha
 Meanwhile Inzamam brought me with his son
 injamaane ne kaha ki ye ladkaa bhale hi meraa ho, lekin cricket main yah apkaa fain he
 'sachin said,' It was very nice to listen to Inzamam, after that i spent some time with Inzamam's son
 'sho ke dauraan sahvaag-sachin, saath hai- vikram sathyesahvag ne bhi injamaam ko lekar ek vakya share kiya
 In that series, Sehwag scored a lot of runs off the balls of Pakistani spinner Danish Kaneria
 sahvaag ne bataaya ki unhone injamaam ko kaha ki mid on ko andar bula lo- mujhe chakka maarna he
 Neither Inzamam nor Sehwag took the matter seriously and called Fielder inside
 phir kya tha sahvaag ne over kii agali hi gend par chakka jad diya
 Danish was extremely upset by Inzamam's decision
 2011 vishwa cap main bharat kii jeet main captain mahendra singh dhoni kaa ahm role tha
 In this match, Dhoni himself decided to bat at number four in place of Yuvraj Singh

 Sehwag was present in the dressing room at that time
 sahvaag ne bataaya ki yah masterstroke kisi or ne nahin, balki sachin kaa tha
 Dhoni played an important role in helping Team India win by playing an unbeaten 91 against Sri Lanka in this match
 sachin ne sahvaag ko lekar kaha ki vah har samay dressing room main kuch na kuch bolte hi rahete the
 Sachin used to bring bananas to silence Sehwag
 sachin ne kaha ki vah kele dekar thodi der ke liye hi sahi unka munh band karaane main safal hote the

 After the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan's fury has increased in such a way that the Prime Minister Imran Khan is no longer shying away from lying
 unhone apane twitor handle se sanyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar ayog main kathith samarthan ke liye 58 deshon ko dhanyavad de daalaa jabaki sachai yah he ki isamen sirf 47 hi desh hi sadsy hai
 In his tweet, Imran Khan wrote, "I applaud the 58 countries who supported Pakistan's demand of the world community that India should stop the use of force in Kashmir, lift the sanctions, the rights of Kashmiris
" Be safeguarded and the Kashmir issue should be resolved according to the UN resolution
 ' unke is twit par kai logon ne soshal media par jamkar majaak udaaya
 Not only this, the Indian State Department also quipped on the question asked on it
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha, yah pakistan, aisa desh jo “aatankwaad kaa centre'' he, kaa “dussahas'' he ki vah geneva main yuanechaarsi satr main maanavadhikaron par vaishvik samudaay kii taraf se bolne kaa dhong kar rahaa he
 He said, "UNHRC has 47 member countries
 ve (pakistan) 60 deshon ke samarthan kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 Good GOING PM IMRAN KHAN
 But make sure we don't tell anyone that we are counting 58 directly after 1
 1-pakistan xxrep 8 ? & then 58- CHINA xxrep 8 ? 2 to 57 Numbers dont exist
 But yeah, don't let Awam know that in reality there are only 47 UNHRC members
 Keep on claiming 58there are 47 countries in UNHRC of which one is India
 Other countries supporting @imrankhanpti & Paxtan must be: # Balochistan # sindhdesh Northern Paxtan Chinese Paxtan Afghan Paxtan Taliban Paxtan jaish-e-paxtan Timatar kingdom Narnia Jurasic park Wakanda land Azkaban On the other hand, contrary to such false claims of Imran Khan, Home Minister Brigadier (retd) Ejaz Ahmed Shah in his government has confessed that Pakistan has failed to get support from international fraternity on Kashmir issue
 unhone kaha ki islamabad ke prayaason ke baavjood duniya bharat kii baat par hi vishwaas karti he
 His statement has created an embarrassing situation for Pakistan

 Under pressure from the online community, Instagram had to change its rules, so that women will now be able to share such photos

 It may contain photographs, videos, and other digitally crafted content, including sexual intercourse, genitalia or photos of a fully naked buttock
 'instagram ke disha-nirdesh main aage kaha gaya he, 'isamen mahila ke stan ke agrabhag kii tasviren bhi shaamil hai, lekin oparation ke jariye hataae gaye stan ke baad kii tasviir or bachche ko stanpan kara rahi mahila kii tasviren saajha kii ja sakengi

 Sharing his picture, television's crime serial 'sons of Anarchy' and 'third Watch' actor Michael Beach's wife Elisha Wilson wrote, 'it's motherhood and it's not always beautiful
 'elisha kii is tasviir ne internet par joardaar bahes ched di
 Elisha later said in another post, 'this is my picture and yes, i am breastfeeding
 main ise instagram par saajha kar rahi hum
 This is the reality and how many mothers are breastfeeding at this time

 Interestingly, many BJP leaders including regional MP Faggan Singh Kulaste reached out to congratulate the new couple
 is maamle ne jab tool pakadaa, tab jaanch kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 According to the information, the Panchayati Raj Day conference was organized on 24 April in Ramnagar, Mandla
 is maukey par teen divasiy aadi utsav bhi hua
 During this ceremony, on 26 April, under the Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojana, Sivaram Vanvasi's daughter Saraswati (22) was converted and converted to Nikah Saddam Hussein
 gambhir baat yah he ki saraswati kaa nikaah uske mata-pita kii gairmaujuudagi main karai gai he
 The administrative staff made Kagazi Khanpure get the tribal girl married and importantly, former union minister and BJP MP Faggan Singh Kulaste was also present along with hundreds of his supporters to congratulate and bless the new couple
 is ghatana par vishwa hindu parishad ke sanghathan mantri avadhesh singh ne kaha ki adivasee ilaakon main sajeesh rachakar gaiyr adivaasiyon kii adivasee ladakiyon se shaadi karai jaati he, taaki vah adivasee ke naam par jameen aadi kharidne ke saath sarkari yojanaon kaa laabh le sake
 After that, the status of those women is nothing more than concubines
 unhone aage kaha ki saraswati ke mata-pita ne muslim se shaadi kaa virodh kiya tha, to prashasan ne shaadi ke aavedan ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Saraswati was cited as not having a good mental condition, but how the marriage came under the Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojana is a question
 yadi nikaah hona tha to nikaah yojana main hona chahie tha
 Not only this, religious conversion must have been done before the marriage of the tribal girl
 unhone is maamle kii shikaayat mandla kii jiladhikari sufia farukhi se kii he
 They have assured investigation
 jiladhikari se kai baar sampark karne kaa prayaas kiya, lekin unhone phone nahin uthaaya
 It seems the district administration is trying to impose the case
 hinduvadi sanghathan jila prashasan kii karypranali se kaaphi naaraaz he
 Scheduled Tribes Commission Chairman Anusuiya Uike said that this is a very serious matter
 ayog ne jiladhikari se sabhi dastavej maange hai
 With this, it is being learned that once this marriage was annulled, how was the marriage under the Chief Minister Kanyadan Yojana
 yah dharm parivartan kaa maamla he
 This is a deception of the innocent people of the scheduled tribe category
 unhone aage kaha ki mandla ke alaava dindori, balaghat main bhi janajaatiy varg ke logon ke vivaah hue hai, un sabhi kii jaanch karai jaaegi
 The commission will examine all the documents on its behalf
 doshiyon par karrwai kii anushansa kii jaaegi
 Anusuiya Uike and MP Sampatiya Uike had also reached to bless the bride and groom, but they did not even realize what went wrong
 baharhaal, is ghatana kaa bhaajapa or hinduvadi sanghathan virodh kar rahe hai, vahiin jila prashasan is par pardaa daalane main juta hua he
 No complaint has been lodged in the concerned police station in this regard

 The counting of votes will take place on 16 May
 sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi or pradhanmantri manmohan singh upie kii sarkaar phir banane kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 But voices have started to rise from within the Congress that a government should be formed with the left front
 isi ke saath tisare morche, vaikalpik morche yaa 'secular' sarkaar banane ke liye khichdi pakaane kii sugabugahat shuru ho gai he
 No such government can be formed without the support of Congress or BJP
 jahaan tak bijepi kaa prashn he, uski ranneeti spasht he - agar use sarkaar banani he, to narendra modi ke hi netritv main banani he, varanaa nahin banani he
 Whereas the Congress seems ready to go to any extent to stop Narendra Modi
 varanaa koi kaaran nahin ki ain chunaavon ke bich congress ke varisht netaa tisare morche yaa secular sarkaar ke geet gane lage
 The first statement came from Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan
 unhone kaha ki congress agali sarkaar banane ke liye tisare morche ke saath haath milaaegi
 Then came the statement of Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid
 unhone kaha ki congress sarkaar banane ke liye yaa to tisare morche kaa samarthan le sakati he yaa phir use samarthan de sakati he
 On Saturday itself, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said a similar thing
 unhone yah ishaara tak de diya ki unki party aisi kisi sarkaar main shaamil bhi ho sakati he
 In the third front which is being said again and again, the names of Mulayam Singh Yadav, Nitish Kumar, m Karunanidhi, Left Front, Jaganmohan Reddy, KC Chandrasekhar Rao, Sharad Pawar are named
 jayalalita, mamata banerjee, naveen patnayak kaa kshetreey front yaa vaikalpik morcha bhi bich-bich main jor martha dikhataa he
 While nothing can be said about Mayawati
 jaahir he jab tak loksabhaa chunaav ke parinaam nahin aate, ye sab baaten sirf kaalpanik hi hai
 But if the opinion polls so far are true, then the possibility of forming a government of Congress with the help of third front or third front seems very less
 endie or upie kii siton main kareeb sau siton ke antar kii sambhaavna vyakt kii ja rahi he or endie ko 272 ke jaadui aankade ke nazadik pahunchataa dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, the idea of forming a government with the parties of the Third Front for the UPA seems far-fetched
 isaki badi vajah yah he ki aisi koi sarkaar banane kii sambhaavna kam he, jisamen mamata banerjee or left front yaa jayalalita-karunanidhi ek saath hon
 Similarly, it seems politically impossible for lalu-nitish or mulayam-mayawati to come together
 yah jarur he ki mulaayam or mayawati donon hi upie-2 ko baahar se samarthan de rahe hai
 But the reason is that both want to keep each other out of the government
 yah maananaa ki jis sarkaar main unamem se koi ek shaamil ho, use doosraa samarthan degaa, vaastaviktaa se pare he
 Significantly, among the possible parties of the third or alternative front, only Jayalalithaa, Mamata Banerjee and Naveen Patnaik are expected to perform well
