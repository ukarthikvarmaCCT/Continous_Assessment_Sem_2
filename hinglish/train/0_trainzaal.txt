 Amid sharp outbursts by political parties and protests from students over the suicide of a researcher at the University of Hyderabad, Union Minister Smriti Irani alleged that the issue was 'dalit vs non dalit issue' with the intention of provoking sentiments for political gains
 a malicious attempt is being made to present it
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani ne apane do anya varisht mantrimandal sahyogiyon - thavar chand gahalot or nirmala sitaraman ke saath samvaadadaataaon ko sambodhit karte hue in aaropon ko sire se khaarij kar diya ki dalit chaatro ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke liye uniwarsity prashasan par dabaav daalaa gaya or is maamle main hastkshep kiya gaya
 Smriti said, this is not a dalit vs non-dalit issue, as some people are presenting to provoke the buildings
 
 
 is vishay ko jati sangharsh banaakar pesh karne kaa durbhaavnapurna prayaas kiya ja rahaa he, jo he hi nahin
 He said that neither the MP nor any political party has been held responsible in the suicide note of Dalit student Rohit Vemula
 congress par is mudde ko raajnneetik rang dene kaa prayaas karne kaa aarope lagaate hue irani ne is sambandh main congress party ke saansad hanumanth raav dwaara sitambar 2014 main likhe patr kaa hawala diya, jisamen pichley chaar saalon ke dauraan vishvavidhyalay main vanchit varg ke chaatro kii aatmahatyaon kaa zikr kiya gaya tha
 The Union Minister said, as expected, the Congress wants to air the issue, but it is unfortunate
 congress ke saansad ne kaha he ki yah samasya chaar saalon se he
 If they had solved the problems four years ago, then perhaps Rohit could have been saved
 smriti irani ne kaha ki maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay kii ore se do-sadasyeey tathy anveshan samiti bheji gai he jo buudhvaar raat waapas lotgi or report pesh karegi
 After this, the details of the case can be ascertained, which is currently under consideration of the court
 aatmahatya ke maamle main jati ke bindu uthaae jane kaa jawaab dete unhone yaad dilaayaa ki ve chaatr jinpar ambedkar chaatr sangh se sambandh rakhane vaale chaatro par hamalaa karne kaa andeh he, ve bhi anya pichde varg se hai
 He said that the University's Executive Council had then approved the expulsion of five students, including Rohit, and an executive sub-committee upheld the sentence, which was constituted to further consider the matter and in which a senior from the Dalit class The teachers were members
 kendriya mantri ne is maamle main dalit virdohi rukh ke aaropon ke jawaab main hostel ke warden evam anya vibhaagon ke kai dalit adhikariyon kii maujuudagi kaa hawala diya or aaropon ko khaarij kiya
 He hoped that justice would happen, as a fair investigation is being done
 tippaniyan While wrapping up the Congress targeting the government in this case, Smriti Irani said, "the executive committee was not formed by this government
" kaaryakari parishad main karyrat sadasyon ko purv kii upie sarkaar ne namit kiya tha
 Taking a softer stance at a later meeting of the Executive Council, it was considered that since the expulsion would not allow students to complete doctorates, it was decided that they were allowed to attend departments, libraries and academic meetings Go but do not go to hostels, administration and other public places
 smriti irani ne haalanki vipaksh par sidhaa prahaar karne se bachate hue kaha ki vah raajnneetik keechad oochhaalane main shaamil nahin hona chaahati hai, lekin kaha ki jo log un par or unki sarkaar kii aalochana kar rahe hai, unhen tathyon ko dekh lenaa chahie
 Smriti Irani, while presenting a copy of Rohit's suicide note, said that she has neither accused the university nor any officer for taking such an unfortunate step

 There were two options before him, or he would marry with full frills according to Indian customs, which would also cost a lot of money
 yaa phir court main shaadi kar len or shaadi main hone kharch hone vaale paison se singapore main ek ghar kharide or singapore jaise desh main aaraam se rahe
 Both opted for the second option and took a home for themselves, but even then their problems did not ease
 singapore ke kamedian shaarul chaanana or rishi ne duusare vikalp ko chunaa or court main shaadi kar lee or apane liye singapore main ek ghar le liya
 Even after this marriage, the problems of both did not ease, because the people of the society viewed their marriage with suspicion

 Is not the same
 agar court main shaadi kii jaati he to sosayadi main rahanaa mushkal ho jaataa he
 Sharul and her husband decided to do a Valentine's Day special
 us dauraan donon milakar shaadiyon par 8 sho karenge or isse ikattha hua paison se shaadi karenge
 When asked by Sherul, are people understanding him, supporting him? So in response, he said, 'this show is getting full support from the people
 sabase acchhee baat yah he ki sho ke tikaton kii bikri bad gai he
 We will both get married in June by depositing the money of this show
 ' iske alaasha shaarul ne bataaya ki is sho ke jariye vah logon ko jaagruk karenge ki mahangi shaadi karne se zyada jaruri singapore jaisi jagah main apana ghar lenaa he

 viechpi netaa surendra jain salaah de rahe hai ki vivaadit bayaan dekar pradhanmantri modi ko pareshaan karne vaale hindu sanghathanon ko baj aana chahie
 In fact, Modi and the Sangh have now understood that sometimes more speaking leaders become detrimental to the government and the party

 Also formed government in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand

 His career began to end after he was defeated in the December 2003 Assembly elections
 sitambar, 2010 main liver kharaab ho jane se unki maut ho gai
 In 2011, a case of fraud with the Air Force came to light when Bhati's children tried to acquire the father's immovable property, which had not been devised
 tabhi charkara ko bhi pataa chalaa ki vaayu sena ke adde ke paas suraksha niyamon main dheel dekar paradise vila ko galat tareeke se madad pahunchaai ja rahi he

 According to the custom prevalent among the landlords at that time, Bhati also took the power of attorney from Kak to retain full authority over the land
 1987 main sthaneey prashasan ne vaayu sena kii ore se 3
 59,000 to Suman Parihar of Jodhpur as compensation for 8 acres of land

 He says, "kak showed the wrongful authority on Air Force land, which was his name in government records
" hamen gumraah kiya gaya
 Kak says that he had no information about any power of attorney or transfer of land because the land did not belong to him

 When Kak came to know of the fake Power of Attorney in his name, he wrote to JDA and told that he has not given Power of Attorney to anyone in 2011

 lloveyou (@_myheartsalman__) onmar 20, 2017 at 9:38pm PDT Who is honest ham sab eemaandaaree ko lekar doharepan ke shikaar hote hai
 Talking about honesty, he starts using his own scale and glasses
 lekin jo eemaandaar hota he uske paas ek hi chashma hota he
 He does not have a dilemma
 wo apane usulon par aage chal nikalataa he
 Stumbling and being a victim of frustration, he is also killed many times
 tabadalaa yaa pramotion eemaandaaree hone kii bahut choti keemat he
 There is a debate about honesty in the case of Haryana IAS officer Ashok Khemka
 yahaan yah saaf kar dena zaruri he ki tabadale ke kaarnon kii thos jaankaree public main nahin he
 Nevertheless, the question arose as to why Khemka was being transferred again and again and there were various arguments about honesty
 kul milakar aisa bataaya jane laga ki eemaandaar hona hi sabase badi yaa ekmaatr yogyata nahin he
 The officer also has to see that he does not create obstacles in the work of the government
 sarkaar ko dekhnaa hota he ki kisi kaam se vyapak maahaul na bighad jaae
 There is no such scale in the bureaucracy that decides which IAS officer is eligible for which post
 uske kariyar kaa record yogyata or jimmedaari ko tay karata he
 All the officers of this cadre are considered worthy, with slight differences
 unka chunaav kam yogya yaa adhik yogya ke aadhaar par nahin hota he
 From this argument, the Health Secretary should only become an IAS studying medicine or Transport Secretary should be a mechanical engineer
 phir bhi sarkaar se lekar adaalaton tak ne mana he ki kis afasar ko kahaan or kab lagaana he uskaa faisla antim he
 But it is not written anywhere that his decision is beyond any review
 loksabhaa chunaavon main jab pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar ke rup main maujuuda pradhanmantri kaha karte the ki na khaauungaa na khaane duungaa to logon kaa bharosa badhata tha ki ek aisa netaa aa rahaa he jo khaane bhi nahin degaa
 With this jum, people began to consider Narendra Modi's honesty more honest than Manmohan Singh's honesty
 yah kaha jane laga tha ki manmohan singh eemaandaar to hai magar bhrashtachar nahin roak paae
 a leader who wants to stop corruption
 zaahir he yah tabhi rukegaa jab netaa ke saath har afasar thaan le ki kuch ho jaae ki kisi ko khaane nahin denge
 There may be some reasons for Khemka's transfer but the message that has gone is not that there is no need to take iron from the lobby of the Transport Department
 manmohan singh ab ek maamle main poochtacha ke liye aaropee bana liye gaye hai lekin tab ve daleel diya karte the ki isse faisle lene kii prakriya par asar padaa he
 In the case of Khemka, it is being argued that such officers should see that there is no hindrance in the development work
 in donon daleelon main koi fark nahin he
 The definition of honesty by not eating or not eating will once again be seen leaning towards Manmohan Singh's honesty
 yani aap mat khaaiye lekin jo khaataa he use khaane se mat rokie
 Do not stop so much that the feeders become angry
 hadtaal kii dhamkee dekar samasya khadi kar den
 What should be the ratio of honesty
 eemaandaar bane rahane kii seemaa kya ho
 You cannot answer this by exposing someone's duplicity
 ye kaam wo karte hai jo chaahate hai ki khaane-khilaane kii thodi bahut gunzaaish bani rahe
 Why can't the system run with officers like Khemka? They are said to be roadblocks
 jo afasar bhrashtachar ko mitaa rahaa he wo nai sadak bana rahaa he yaa road block paidaa kar rahaa he? or jo bhrasht log eemaandaar logon ke liye road block paidaa kar rahe hai uskaa kya? Not only this, Khemka is also being called Marwarik (english word)
 yani ek aisa eemaandaar afasar jo thodaa fituri he
 Freak
 wo khwamkhah har baat main taang adaate rahata he
 In this country, more honest society does more than any system does not go crazy
 raja harishchandra kii misaal eemaandaaree ke yashgan ke liye nahin di jaati he balki ulaahna ke liye di jaati he ki chale hai harishchandra banane
 OK, we are all victims of this duplicity, but in elections, the leaders say that corruption will be eradicated
 kya bina sakht hue, bina jununee hue bhrashtachar ko mitaayaa ja saktaa he? And when there was a ruckus in Parliament on this Khemka report, there were election speeches, then no one said that he is a cynical officer
 jaanch report yaa nyaayalay ke faisle tak isaki report par bharosa mat karo
 Then everyone made political use of Khemka's report in the name of this honesty and courage
 ek aise samay main jab haryana sarkaar kii sieji kii report kah rahi ho ki robert wadra ke khilaaf khemka kii jaanch sahi he usee samay main unki eemaandaaree ko fituri bataaya ja rahaa he
 Corruption thrives in a network
 is network se koi nahin batch paata
 Everyone knows this, yet there is always a hunger in the public for an honest person who is eccentric and courageous
 na khaauungaa or na khaane duungaa kaa naaraa or bharosa ek kism kaa junun or saahas hi he
 Now it is being said that honest should be mixed
 is baat main dam ho saktaa he lekin jahaan mafia kaa jaal bich gaya ho vahaan kitna mila jula kar chalaa ja saktaa he
 Are we saying that it is okay to live with them? eemaandaar hona bharat ke samaaj main vyaktigat jokhim kaa kaam he
 One who is honest puts his everything at stake
 chaahe wo afasar ho yaa netaa
 In politics, honest leaders also take little risk
 hamaari raajnneeti bhrashtatar mitaane or paardarshita laane kii baat karti he
 Has transparency been achieved? Will a copy of the Khemka case file or verdict be found? Every day, there are reports in the newspaper about blunting the edge of the Right to Information Act
 har rajya or har sarkaar se aise khabaren aa rahi hai
 Khemka transfers are not common
 agar he bhi, iske zariye eemaandaaree ko paribhaashit karnaa vaisaa hi he jaise kai baar log kam khaane vaale yaa paise lekar pakkaa kaam karne vaale ko hi eemaandaar maanane kaa bhram paal lete hai
 The definition of honesty cannot be coined according to convenience
 or agar ise lacheela bananaa he to kya ham yah tay karne ke liye taiyaar honge ki afasaron ko kis had tak beyimaan hone kii chhot honi chahie
 Integrity versus development is also a weak argument
 kya yah kaha ja rahaa he ki vikaas bina bhrashtachar ke nahin ho saktaa
 Cannot be flexible
 to ye daleel bhrashtachar yaa girohtantr ke haq main kaise nahin hui ye to koi bataae
 Aligarh Muslim University is once again at the center of controversies
 yahaan kuch ladakiyon ne union ke chunaav ke dauraan prachaar kiya tha or jhande laharaae the
 Now some students are opposing it
 unka kahana he ki yah gaiyrislamic he
 This news has been given by an English newspaper
 akhbaar ke mutabik vahaan aaj chaatr sangh ke chunaav hone hai or uske liye pichley dinon prachaar abhiyaan chalaa
 Students also participated in it

 Those students had kept the burqa on, yet some students had reservations
 is par ladakiyon ne palat kar jawaab diya or kaha ki koi bhi unki abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke adhikaar par koi bhi sawaal nahin uthaa saktaa
 On the one hand, those people call us sisters and on the other hand point fingers at our freedom, they should know that we are not stupid
 kisi ladki dwaara jhanda uthaanaa paap nahin he
 It is said that some boys on campus had objected to the lifting of placards of girls wearing burqas
 unka kahana tha ki yah islamic samskruti ke khilaaf he or ladkiyaan chaatr raajnneeti se dur rahen
 Names of 10,000 girls are registered in Aligarh Muslim University but only one student is contesting
 vah he kahakansha khanam
 He said that it is very difficult to contest elections here and when a girl contests elections, people say that a politician has her hands on it
 aligarh muslim uniwarsity main chaatraon ke saath nyaay nahin hota
 They are discriminated against
 mujhe is baat se koi hairaani nahin hui ki kisi ladki ke jhanda lahraane ke maamle ko tool diya gaya
 Some people are saying that it is against the university's tradition
 parampara shabd kaa istemaal ladakiyon ko dabaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Why should not the girls wave the flag? Another student asked why we should not support any candidate
 ek chaatr ne kaha ki yah vivaad anuchit he
 Doing so is a violation of their political rights

 An angry mob of hundreds of people collapsed a large part of the boundary wall that had been built a week earlier
 is garmagarmee vaale maahaul ke bich ranchi ke espi (gramin) aseem vikrant minj kaa sir rodebaaji main jaise hi fata, gussai police ne darjanon pradarshnakariyon kii haddiyaan chatkha deen
 Savita was leading around 100 girls of our age
 vah kahati he, ''ham haragij apni jameen nahin denge
 My father is a farmer
 mere do chote-chote bhai hai
 Where will those people go? '' savita ke liye yah andolan bhale hi ek romaanchakaari anand kaa kaaran ho lekin baaki sab sahame hue hai
 He has lost the last legal battle to save his land in the Supreme Court
 graminon kii esalapi ko supreme court ne yah kehete hue khaarij kar diya ki adhigrahan kaa yah maamla kaaphi purana he or yachikakarta ne apil karne main kaaphi der kar di
 The Ranchi district administration had acquired this land from the order of the then Bihar government from about 153 landowners during 1957-58 to establish the Seeds Farm of Birsa Agricultural University
 sirf 25 raiyaton ne paise hasil kiye
 1,33,732 in the name of those in the Treasury of Ranchi even today
 jamaa hai jinhone apni jameen dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Even at that time, the administration had to face considerable resistance to seize the land
 tab se lekar gramin is jameen ko jot rahe the
 When this land was chosen for the establishment of IIM and Law University in 2010, the issue of land acquisition suddenly began to take hold
 ranchi ke upayukta vinay kumaar choube kehete hai, ''ham sthiti par lagaataar najar banaae hue hai
 It is wrong to say that the government is taking away land from someone
 1957-58 main kanoonee prakriyaaon kaa paalan karte hue is jameen kaa adhigrahan kiya gaya tha
 After the order of the Supreme Court, there should be no doubt in one's mind
 agar yah adhigrahan galat hota to court ne ise nirast kar diya hota
 "there are only a few people who seem ready to give their land, but not at the rate of 1957-58
" kisaan shankar oraanv kehete hai, ''sarkaar kahati he ki tregeri main rakhe paise le lo
 i ask the princes to show up with these money for two days by driving home
 '' 1957-58 main adhigrahan ke dauraan ek dismil jameen kii keemat sarkari taur par 27 ru
 was
 is hisaab se unhen puraani dar par 227 acre ke liye mahaj 1,55,147 ru
 Whereas according to today's compensation this amount crosses the figure of several hundred crores
 ve isi tark ko lekar court gaye the
 His faith in leaders has been completely lost
 haalanki logon main ek ummid ab bhi baaki he-bihar bhoomi sudhaar act-1950
 It states that if the land for which it was acquired is not used for that purpose within 50 years of the acquisition, the land will be returned to the original owners
 yahi ek ummid he, lekin yah ladaai lambii chalane vaali he

 Tech Mahindra, an e-governance partner in the three municipal corporations of Delhi, has accused it of not paying dues of more than Rs 100 crore and warned of shutting down services
 haalanki sthaneey nikaayon ne aaropon kaa khandan karte hue baithak bulaai he taaki muddon ko suljhaayaa ja saketin nigamon tathaa tech mahindra main is vivaad se inaki online sevaayen baadhit ho sakati hai
 The company has given time till Tuesday to pay the dues to the corporations, while South Delhi Municipal Corporation Commissioner (SDMC) Manish Gupta said, 'the company is stating arrears of Rs 100 crore which is not correct as only Rs 15 crore is outstanding
 And that is also because the company could not complete the procedural formalities
 ' unhone kaha ki mudde ko sulajhane ke liye guuruuvaar ko baithak bulaai he jisamen tino ayukta maujuud rahenge
 We do not want citizens to be affected by services bhartiya janata party (BJP), jiskaa puraa janaadhar hi hindutv ke mudde par aadhaarit he, ab lagata he ki isi mudde ko satta main bane rahane ke liye hathiyaar ke taur par upyog karne ja rahi he
 i am writing this because since winning a landslide victory in 2019, the party is confident that the people will vote in all the elections in the country, keeping in mind its Hindutva and national love image
 haal hi main hue maharashtra or haryana vidhansabha chunaavon main BJP ko kam siten milin, lekin party kaa chunavi mudda loksabhaa chunaav kii tarah rashtrawaad or hindutv hi tha, isliye donon pradeshon main BJP number van party ban kar ubhari
 Although many critics are criticizing the bjp's defeat because they believe that the party sidelined local issues, so the party did not do well, but we have to pay attention that the issue of Article 370 and NRC also BJP Haryana was successful in winning 41 seats, while the people of Maharashtra gave absolute majority to the BJP and Shiv Sena alliance on the issue of Hindutva
 yah alag baat he ki donon partiyaan chunaav ke baad alag ho gayi
 It is to be understood that even after running a five-year government in both the states, the BJP leadership contested on the issue of nationalism and Hindutva, the same is the case with Jharkhand
 yahaan bhi party anuchhed 370, ram mandir or NRC ko hi chunaav prachaar main pramukhataa se sthaan de rahi he, jisase saaf he ki party apane astitv ko bachaae rakhane or kai saalon tak raaj karne ke liye in muddon ko hi chunaavon main pramukhataa se uthaaegi
 The Citizenship (amendment) Bill, 2019, which was approved in the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday (december 4, 2019), has taken another step towards the Hindu nation, which is bigger than Article 370 for BJP in the coming days
 The masterstroke is going to prove, as Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said, because the main objective of this bill is that the neighboring countries where the voice of the minorities is suppressed, they should be tortured It is done, India is a support for all such people, where they can become citizens and live a good, happy life
 haalanki sarkaar ne yah bhi saaf kar diya he ki vidheyak ke tahat disambar, 2014 ke pehle se bharat main rah rahe logon ko hi naagarikta di jaaegi
 In this way, BJP is trying to show its Hindutva image prominently in the country and abroad
 duusari ore, naagarikta vidheyak ko vot bank kii raajnneeti ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 By granting citizenship to people of Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Jain, Parsi and Christian faith, the government hopes that all these people will act as a vote bank for it in times to come
 yah aarope vaisaa hi he, jaisaa BJP pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee ke khilaaf avaidh bangladeshi logon ko naagarikta dekar unka upyog vot bank kii raajnneeti karne ke liye lagaati he
 However, this move of the government will also send a wrong message among the people of the Muslim community about the intention of the government
 jo muslim samudaay teen talaak bill ko lekar BJP ke kareeb aayaa tha or usne BJP ke paksh main 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main vot kiya, vah samudaay naagarikta bill ko lekar kahin na kahin ek baar phir BJP se dur ja saktaa he
 By the way, if we talk about this bill, it is not a new law which is going to bring the government, rather the government is amending the already existing law 'citizenship Act, 1955'
 aaie jaanate hai, is vidheyak kii pramukh baaten
 
 
 1
 sarkaar us niyam ko badalanaa chaahati he, jisamen pehle 11 varsh tak bharat main rah chuke avaidh pravasi ko bhartiya naagarikta pradaan kii jaati thi, lekin sarkaar is sanshodhan ke zariye is avadhi ko 11 saal se ghataakar chah saal karne ja rahi he
 2
 naagarikta adhinium, 1955 main sabhi dharmon ke logon ko naagarikta pradaan karne kaa praavdhaan tha, lekin nae vidheyak main sirf hindu, buddha, sikh, jain, parsi or isai dharm ke un logon ko hi naagarikta dene kaa praavdhaan he, jo afghanistan, pakistan yaa bangladesh se aae hon
 3
 is kanoon ke antargat sirf vahi log bhartiya naagarikta ke yogya honge, jo 31 disambar, 2014 ke pehle se bharat main rah rahe hai
 2
 purvattar pradeshon main is bill kaa sabase zyaada virodh ho rahaa he
 The reason for this is the impact on their culture and civilization
 3
 In Assam, this bill is against the Assam Agreement, 1985 and NRC, because according to the Assam Agreement, 1985, whoever comes to live in the state after 1971, irrespective of their religion, cannot be granted citizenship in Assam
 is kaaran assam main NRC or CAB (naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak) lekar logon main bhram kii sthiti he
 At the same time, through this bill, the Government of India also wants to tell its neighbors that its doors are open to non-muslim communities
 sarkaar ke paas is vidheyak ko loksabhaa main paas karaane ke liye paryaapt sankhya he, lekin rajyasabha main uske liye mushkil khadi ho sakati he, kyonki yahaan sarkaar kii sahyogi JDU hi is mudde par usase sahamat nahin he
 At the same time, after the Sena's alliance with the BJP, the number in the Rajya Sabha has reduced with the government
 haalanki BJP ke liye acchhee baat yah he ki is bill par use BJD or YSRCP ne samarthan dene kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 After the bill was approved under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government got the bill passed in the Lok Sabha on Monday (december 9, 2019)
 kai samaajik sanghathan vidheyak ke virodh main pradarshan kar rahe hai, lekin purvottar main baari virodh ke baad sarkaar ne vidheyak main parivartan kar kaha he ki jin ilaakon main inner line permit (ILP) lagu he, tathaa purvottar ke chaar rajyon main chah anusuchit janajaatiy kshetron ko naagarikta (sanshodhan) vidheyak main shaamil nahin kiya jayega
 The Indian team will take on neighboring Bangladesh in the semi-finals of the ICC Champions Trophy
 kaagajon par dekhen to bhartiya team ke saamne bangladesh kii team kahin nahin tikti he, lekin kai aise maukey aae hai jab usne bada ulatpher kiya he
 Before this match, people on Twitter are advising Bangladesh to win with the Indian team
 darasal, champions trophy main (ICC champions trophy 2017) main bharat teen lig match khele
 In the first match against Pakistan, Team India registered a stunning victory by 124 runs
 vahiin behad majboot dikh rahi team india (team india) srilanka ke khilaaf match main puri tarah chit ho gai
 Sri Lanka not only registered a resounding seven-wicket victory, but they also showed batting, bowling and fielding, overtaking Team India on all fronts
 is match ko dekhakar log ashanka jataa rahe the ki dakshin africa ke khilaaf match main bhartiya team shaayad hi jeet darj kar paae, lekin ravivaar ko khele gaye match main viraat kohli kii aguwai vaali bhartiya team alag hi andaaj main dikhi
 The Indian team registered an eight-wicket win, proving the world's number one ODI team dwarfed on every front
 iske baad twitor yugers ne team india kii jeet darj karne ke peeche kaa ajeeb hi kaaran dhund nikaala
 People are writing on Twitter and Facebook that Team India defeats the green jersey team badly

 com / bosq94b0le After the bjp's victory in the Lok Sabha elections, the process of changing the face of Trinamool Congress mlas and leaders in West Bengal is going on
 somvaar ko naupaara vidhansabha seat se trinmul congress (TMC) vidhayak sunil singh tathaa party ke 12 parshad dilli main BJP main shaamil hue the
 After joining BJP, Sunil Singh had said, 'people in West Bengal want' Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'
 
 
 yah modi ji kii sarkaar he, or ham rajya main yahi sarkaar bananaa chaahate hai, taaki pashchim bengal kaa vikaas kiya ja sake
 'let me tell you, earlier also three mlas and more than 50 councilors have left the TMC and joined the BJP
 haal main hue loksabhaa chunaav main pashchim bengal kii 42 loksabhaa siton main tiemasi ko 22 siten mili hai, jabaki bijepi ke khate main 18 siten gai hai
 In 2014, the BJP had to satisfy itself with just two seats in the state
 maaloom ho ki mamata banerjee or bhaajapa main loksabhaa chunaav se hi tanatani chal rahi he
 During the campaign for the Lok Sabha elections, PM Modi had addressed a rally in Bengal and said that 40 mlas will join BJP after the results of the election
 piem modi ne kaha tha ki ye vidhayak lagaataar unke sampark main hai
 After this, Bengal in-charge of BJP Kailash Vijayvargiya had said that TMC mlas will join BJP in installments
 haal hi main trinmul congress ne kendriya grahamantri amit shah ko likhe ek patr main aarope lagaaya tha ki pashchim bengal sarkaar ko bheja gaya grih mantralay kaa paraamarsh bhaajapa kaa ‘gaharaa shadyantr' or dwaara vipaksh shasit rajyon main ‘satta hathiyaane kii chaal' he
 However, the BJP termed the allegations as baseless and claimed that the law and order situation in the state has completely collapsed
 trinmul congress ke mahasachiv evam pashchim bengal ke mantri parth chatarji ne patr main likhaa ki kendriya grih mantralay ne jamini hakeekat jane bina yaa rajya sarkaar se report liye bina nishkarsh nikaal liya
 He wrote, 'we lodge a strong objection on the advice of the Home Ministry on behalf of the Trinamool Congress and appeal that it be withdrawn immediately
 ' There is a lot of emphasis on promoting sports in the country
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne khud agle teen olympic main bharat kaa pradarshan behatar karne ke liye task force banane kaa elaan kiya
 You will be surprised to know what happened in Bihar to national level players on the one hand and so much attention to sports on the one hand
 in khilaadiyon ke liye yojit kiye gaye sammaan samaaroh main hi inkaa apmaan kiya gaya
 National Sports Day is celebrated on 29th of August every year on the birthday of hockey magician Major Dhyanchand in the insult of players on National Sports Day
 is saal 29 agast ko rashtriya str ke khilaadiyon kaa sammaan karne ke liye bihar main sammaan samaaroh kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 There was also a dinner program on this occasion
 lekin dinar main jo khilaadiyon ke saath kiya gaya wo puure desh ko sharmasaar karne vaala tha
 The national level players were asked to show their certificates before joining the Certificate Dinner, which had to show the players before going to dinner
 khel adhikari ek-ek khilaadi kaa certificate dekhne ke baad hi unhen dinar ke liye andar jane de rahe the
 The extent of this occurred when the marking of the food was found on the players' certificates
 kuch khilaadiyon ne is tarah apmaan kiye jane kaa virodh kiya
 But the officials, who were completely shameless, heard the protesting players declare their exit
 haalanki unki is harakat ko kuch khilaadiyon ne video main kaid kar liya
 Surprisingly, State Sports Minister Shivchandra Ram was also present in this program organized by the Sports Ministry of Bihar
 ab aise main khud andaaj lagaaya ja saktaa he ki khilaadiyon ke saath is tarah kaa bartaav kiya jayega to kaise unase antarrashtriya str par medalon kii barsaat kii ummid ja sakati he

 The letter of agreement states that if Donald Trump becomes president of the US in 2016, Jude Markowicz will have to return the loan amount to his brother

 bijepi kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne kashmir raily main anuchhed 370 par jo kaha, us par siyaasi ghamaasan chhid chukaa he
 In such a situation, Modi has got the support of such a personality, which he has rarely thought about
 kendriya mantri shashi tharur kii patni or khud mul rup se kashmiri pandit sunanda pushkar ne ek angreji news channel ke sho main kaha ki rajya kii mahilaayein agar duusare rajya ke purush se shaadi karti hai, to unke saath bhedbhaav hota he
 If someone says that it is not, then he is lying
 sunanda ne sunai aapbeetee
 
 
 Sunanda Pushkar while sharing her experience said, 'in 2006-07 and 2008 i tried to buy land in Jammu
 main apane rajya main jameen lenaa chaahati thi
 But the DC office official, whose name i will not name, said that you have married a man from another state and now you cannot buy land here
 maine unhen bataaya ki mere pati kii mrityu ho chuki he, to kya main abhi bhi kashmir kii naagarikta waapas hasil nahin kar sakati hum? unhone kaha, nahin
 And his tone was very rood
 main kaaphi dinon tak vahaan jaati rahi
 After three consecutive years i was told that i had lost the right to regain my citizenship here
 'kashmiri mahilaon or purushon main hota he bhedbhaavasunanda pushkar ne bataaya, 'maine unase kaha ki main apni ek aisi dost ko jaanati hum jisane ek kashmiri purush se shaadi kii or vah kashmir main jameen kharid sakati he or uske bachche bhi aage jaakar aisa kar sakate hai
 So are you trying to tell me that i am a Kashmiri girl and after getting married in an out-of-state state, i cannot buy land, while after marrying a woman from another state, Kashmiri men can also buy land and their Children too
 'sunanda pushkar ne umr abdulla se bhi kii baat
 
 
 Sunanda said, 'I also talked to Omar Abdullah in this matter
 unhone mujhe bataaya ki 10 saal pehle kanoon main badlaav hue hai
 Now i do not understand why there is this miscommunication between the government and DC office? Omar himself told me that it could happen
 main khud is maamle main aapaki madad karuunga
 But they told me that i can get citizenship of Kashmir but not my son
 ''acchhee baat he ki modi ne ye mudda uthaaya'sunanda pushkar ne kaha, 'main is mudde ko raajnneeti se nahin jodna chaahati hum
 Good thing Narendra Modi raised this issue
 netaaon ko vot chahie isliye wo is mudde par bol rahe hai
 What did the BJP itself do when it was in power? abhi vot hasil karne ke liye ye kahana ki ham ye karenge ham wo karenge bahut aasaan he
 i would be very happy if something happens on this issue
 'unhone saath hi saaf taur par kaha ki rajya main mahilaon ke saath bhedbhaav kiya jaataa he
 Kabul International Airport in Afghanistan was attacked by militants in the early hours of Thursday, forcing the airport to close temporarily
 aatankwaadiyon ke hamale par suraksha balon ne bhi palatwaar kiya, jisamen chaar hamalavar maare gaye
 Afghan Army General Afzal Aman said the militants captured two buildings about 700 meters from the airport and they were attacked by rockets and guns on jet fighters flying in the skies of the airport and Kabul
 Were used as a base
 kabul ke police pramukh mohammad jahir jahir ne baad main kaha ki chaar hamlawar maare gaye or koi aam naagarik yaa pulicekarmi hataahat nahin hua

 yah hamalaa aise samay main hua he, jab raashtrapati chunaavon ke vivaadit duusare daur ke matdaan ke baad jari matganana ke kaaran afghanistan main kaaphi tanaav kaa maahaul he
 This presidential election, which is being held before the foreign army moves out of Afghanistan later this year, is considered to be very important towards ensuring peace in the country

 The BJP, which was trying to strengthen its foothold in West Bengal, had to see opposition within the party on Monday night
 party kii saansad or pashchim bengal main bijepi leader roopa ganguli ne party ke rajya prabharee dilip ghosh par abhadrata karne ke aarope lagaae hai
 Former actress Roopa Ganguly tweeted this at around 12:30 pm on Monday night
 unhone kaha he ki dilip ghosh ne unhen saarvajanik taur par beizzat kiya
 Roopa further said that she can contact PM Modi and BJP President Amit Shah, but it has become difficult to contact Dilip Ghosh
 roopa ganguli ne kaha he ki piem or bijepi adhyaksh se sampark karnaa kaaphi aasaan he, lekin dilip ghosh ke maamle main aisa nahin he
 Rupa has said that the media in-charge of state party in-charge Dilip Ghosh has blocked his access to Ghosh
 Who is your media in charge in bengal dilip da
 
 kindly let me know
 And kindly ask him / her to call me tomorrow morning around 10 am
 
 nobody replies at the core committee msg group
 
 couldnt message you either
 
 Its blocked as well — Roopa Ganguly (@roopaspeaks) February 19, 2018 Rupa tagged Dilip Ghosh in a tweet, 'ask your media in-charge to contact me on Tuesday morning
 party kii kor cameti ke group par koi bhi kisi massej kaa jawaab nahin detaa he
 i feel that i have also been prevented from messaging you
 'I can message modi ji
 
 but i am barred from messaging you dilip da
 
 i can speak to amit bhaisahab 
 
 but you sream at me in public with abusive language
 
 i always kept quiet because my father taught me to be obedient to the seniors

 But i am prevented from messaging you

 But you shouted at me among people, abused me

 co / 0fwvjpwptw— Roopa Ganguly (@roopaspeaks)february 19, 2018aapako bataa den ki bijepi pashchim bengal main apane pair jamaane kii koshish main he
 It is competing with CPM and Trinamool Congress in this task
 bijepi ke saamne agle saal hone vaale loksabhaa chunaavon main party kaa pradarshan behatar karne kii chunauti he
 The real test of all the bjp's exercise will be in the 2021 assembly elections
 isi ke chalate bijepi ne trinmul congress ke diggat netaa mukul raay ko apane saath mila liya he
 In view of the Muslim vote in the state, BJP has also organized a Muslim convention here
 pichley saal hue nikaay chunaavon main bhi bijepi duusare sthaan par rahi thi
 In such a situation, there may be concern for the disunity among the leaders at the state level
 aapako bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi ko 17 fisadi vot mili the, haalanki, uske haath sirf do seat hi lagi thim
 BJP had gained one seat compared to 2009
 iske alaava 2016 main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi kaa vot 6 fisadi badha tha or party ko 10 fisadi mat mili the
 Three BJP mlas were successful in winning these elections
 jabaki uske gathbandhan ko 6 siten mili thim
 In the Aarushi case, the CBI has written in its report that when the Noida police theory was rediscovered, many important and shocking facts have come up
 masalan, ghar ke andar he qaatil?, taala kaise khulaa?aarushi kaa kamare kaa darwaja aisa tha jise andar se band kar diya jaae to use bagaiyr chaabi ke baahar se nahin kholaa ja saktaa yaa andar maujuud shaks hi darwaja khol saktaa he
 His parents used to lock the door during the night
 lekin katl kii subah jab doctor dampatti uthe to aarushi ke kamare kaa darwaja khulaa hua tha
 It was found in the investigation that once the lock is closed, then it could be opened only by Aarushi or it could be opened by the key which was near the Talwar couple, but both of them could not tell the CBI that night Whether or not they had closed the door and why the Talwar couple could not find the key to the room in the morning
 katl ke baad cameraa durust kiya gayasibiai ne saaf kiya he ki katl ke baad aarushi ke kamare kii tasviren yani mauka-e-vaardaat qatl ko dekhakar aisa lag rahaa tha ki jaise kamare main rakhi har chiz ko salike se rakh diya gaya he
 Because it is possible that someone is murdered and does not even get on his bed? Investigations have also revealed that no blood marks have been found on the bag and pink colored pillows placed right next to Aarushi
 postmortem report badalane kaa dabaavasibiai ne apni report main khulaasa kiya he ki doctor dinesh talwaar ne postmortem report main herpher karne ke liye dabaav bhi banaaya tha
 Attempts were made to hide the rape in the post-mortem on behalf of the Talwar family
 yahaan tak ki postmortem report main is baat ke saboot mili he ki postmortem ke pehle hi aarushi ke guptangon kii safai karne kii koshish bhi kii gai thi
 According to Rajesh Talwar, Rajesh Talwar's golf stick, Aarushi and Hemraj were killed with golf's number 5 stick
 rajesh talwaar noida ke golf club ke member hai
 Rajesh Talwar used to keep golf sticks in his Santro car
 lekin sentro car ko servicing par le jate vakt rajesh talwaar ke driver ne golf stick nikaalkar hemraj ke kamare main rakh deen
 When Aarushi and Hemraj were murdered, the police took pictures of both the rooms but in those pictures only one stick is seen in Hemraj's room
 tasveeron se 5 number kii stick gaayab thi
 When the police questioned Rajesh Talwar about the number 5 stick, he could not answer
 golf kii 5 number kii stick kuch mahino baad noopur talwaar ko ghar kii safai ke dauraan mili
 But that stick was handed over to the CBI a year later
 sibiai ne jab stick kii jaanch karwaai to pataa chalaa ki stick ko puri tarah se chamakaa kar polish kiya gaya tha
 Just imagine that someone outside the house can do these tasks with such leisure
 shaayad nahin
 These are just some of the reasons which have once again brought the doctor couple into doubt

 — Swara Bhasker (@reallyswara)june 10, 2019kya he puraa maamla?aligarh main ek bacchee 30 may ko laapata hui thi
 The next day the parents lodged a complaint with the police
 2 june ko ghar se kuch hi duuri par kooday ke dher par bachi mili
 According to the postmortem report, both eyes of the girl were damaged
 ridh kii sari haddiyaan tuuti hui thim
 Acid was also put on his body
 sharir par kutton ke nonche or kaate jane ke nishaan the
 Why was the murder? According to the police, the accused borrowed money from the girl's father
 jab usne paise lautaae to usamen 5 hajaar rupee kam the
 Both of them quarreled over this matter
 iske baad aaropee ne 30 may ko bacchee ko agava kar diya
 After this, he strangled him to death
 
 When i went to the market, i saw a place too crowded in the midst of crowd
 gol gheraa-sa bana tha
 Especially there were more number of women
 jigyasaavash vahaan gaya to pataa chalaa ki vahaan golgappas bik rahe hai
 Now what about Golgappas, you will find them from Bengali Market in Delhi to Connaught Place and Sangam Vihar to Rohini
 lekin yah aisa shuddh swadeshi dish he jo desh ke har hisse main miltaa he
 Golgappa is a Urdu word
 jaisaa naam se hi pataa chalata he ki gol puri jaisi cheez main aalu ke chatkaredaar masala banaakar daalaa jaataa he or usase bhi chatkaredaar ras usamen bharkar kaagaj ke pattal yaa patton ke done main rakhie or rakhane ke fouran baad gapp se udrastha kar jaaie
 You are not late, that bubble has not burst
 todakar isko khaanaa to takreeban utana hi naammumkin he jitna gyaarah mulkon kii police ke liye don ko pakadana
 So Golgappa became the word just by keeping the round thing in the mouth
 vaise angrejidan logon ko bataa den ki angreji ke shabdkosh main golgappas kaa arth ‘pani se bharaa indian bread’ yaa phir ‘crisp sphere iten’ likhaa gaya he! iske hi ek or naam paneepuri kaa shabdic arth he "pani kii roti" iske mul ke bare main bahut kam jaankaree he pani puri shabd ko 1955 main or golgappa shabd ko 1951 main darj kiya gaya
 Tell me, what is the difference in Golgappa? There is a puri, which is made either from flour or by adding semolina
 phir golgappas vaala apane anguuthe se isamen badi mulymiyat se ek chhed karata he, or usamen ek masala daalata he
 In different areas, the spices filled in Golgappe may be different
 lekin aalu usamen kendriya bhoomika main hota he
 While preparing potato masala, boiled potatoes are mixed with tamarind water, chilli, chaat masala, onion, etc
 is masaale ko golgappas ke andar daalkar use fouran matake main bhare ek or taral se bharkar aapako diya jaataa he
 It also contains tamarind juice and salt, also chilli powder
 lekin iske alahada jaayke bhi hote hai
 There is no lemon water, mint water, dates water and boondi vinegar water, recently my sabka was also infused with asafoetida flavored water
 par meraa pasandida to jharkhand-bengal vaala halkaa khattapan liye imali kii khatai vaala pani hi he
 Right now i am writing this, the taste of Golgappa has floated on the tongue and mouth watering
 vaise jharkhand urisa, chhattisgarh or bihar main golgappas ko gup chup kehete hai
 There are number of Golgappa's Diwanas across the country
 so unhone apane pyaar ke mutabik, golgappas ko kai naam die hai
 In Maharashtra, its name is Panipuri, and in Gujarat, Panipuri
 bengal or bangladesh main isko phuchakaa kehete hai
 Some consider the introduction of Golgappa to Benaras
 san 1970 main dilli se bacchon kii ek magazine nikalati thi, jiskaa naam rakhaa gaya tha ‘golgappa’
 But the history to be told tells something else
 jo log dilli aae hai yaa yahaan rahete hai unhen puraani dilli khaskar laal kile ke aasapaas ke ilaake main jane kaa mauka zarur mila hoga
 In the place where there is Chandni Chowk, you must have seen a square called a fountain
 is alakatre kii aaj kii sadak par badshaah shahjahan ke vakt main naharen banavaai gai thim, jo yamuna kaa pani kile or shahar tak laati thim
 The residents of entire Shahjahanabad (then Delhi) drank water from the same canal
 lekin, ek vakt aayaa jab us nahar kaa pani kisi vajah se ganda ho gaya or shahar ke log kai-dast se pareshaan ho gaye
 Then Shah Jahan's daughter Roshanara called Shahi Hakim and asked him to prepare a recipe for these sick people
 hakim sahab ne nuskhaa taiyaar kar diya or logon ko pilaayaa
 People were healed but some people found the taste of it very fun
 so un shaukeen logon ne is nuskhe ko bananaa jari rakhaa or use aate kii choti puriyon main bharkar piya jane laga
 So in this way Golgappa was born, which is blown out of nowhere, somewhere secretly water, somewhere where water is full and somewhere else is known by name
 rajasthan or uttar pradesh ke kuch hisson main ise patashi naam se janaa jaataa he
 Five flavored betas are also quite popular in Lucknow with five different test waters
 iskaa pani sookhe aam se banaaya jaataa he
 Chapatis in Gujarat are called Phulki, but in eastern Uttar Pradesh and parts of Nepal, Gol Gappas are also called Phulki
 is naam se ise kaaphi kam log jaanate hai
 Gol Gappas in Hoshangabad in Madhya Pradesh are called tikkis
 jo log thodi bhades jabaan jaanate hai unke liye padhaaka shabd jarur pataakhe se taalluk rakhata hoga lekin aligarh main golgappon ko padhaaka hi kehete hai
 So in some parts of Gujarat it is also called dumplings
 isamen seve or pyaaj milaayaa jaataa he or pani ko pudine or hari mirch se tikhaa banaate hai
 Its price is also not much
 jo golgappa ham amuman khate hai abhi, vah koi das rupye main chaar milte he
 One in childhood ke das golgappas milte the, isaki yaad to mujhe bhi he
 But the real fun is when someone says to Golgappu, brother, add a little more chili to it
 log jab golgappas jab kha chuke hote hai to saath main ghalue main, bhaiya sukhi khilaa do kahana kattai nahin bhoolatey
 After all, which is more lovely than the original
 to agali dfa jab bhi golgappas khaane jaaen to shahi hakim or shahzadi roshanara ko jarur yaad kijiega or barsaat ke mausam main isse bachane kii koshish to kijiega,lekin saath hi yah bhi yaad rakhiegaa ki yah jo golgappa he na, yah he asli swadeshi dish

 The opinion of political parties is divided on the results of the Exit Polls on the results of the Lok Sabha elections
 sabhi ise apane-apane chashme se dekh rahe hai
 The BJP has termed it as expected, while the Congress has claimed that the exit poll results are quite contradictory
 bijepi (BJP) ne daawa kiya he ki eczit pole (exit Polls) ke nattejey jamini hakeekat ko bayaan kar rahe hai
 BJP national vice president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe told NDTV - The exit poll shows that the grand alliance has failed in Uttar Pradesh
 vinay sahasrabudde ne kaha, "mahagathbandhan kaa prayog fail ho gaya he
 Vot transfer could not be done between SP and BSP
 congress ke maidan main utarane se vipaksh kaa vot vibhajit hua or iskaa phayda bijepi ko mila
 "but the Congress (congress) has questioned the claims of the exit poll
 congress ke chhattisgarh prabharee piel puniya kaa daawa he ki eczit pole ke daavon main virodhabhas hai
 Some have given 65 to BJP in UP and some have given 22
 
 
 piel puniya ne kaha, "exit pole ke nateezon main antarvirodh he
 In Uttar Pradesh, BJP has been given 22 to 65 seats
 isamen koi tark yaa logic nahin he
 "amidst this debate, the JDU has claimed that the Lalu Yadav's absence from the election campaign would harm the Grand Alliance
 tejasvi yadav lalu kii viraasat ko aage nahin badha paae
 There is no doubt that the difference in the different exit polls is giving the Congress reason to believe that they can fail
 lekin saare ke saare eggzet pole ye saaf kar dete hai ki badhat endie ko mil rahi he
 Now on the 23rd, you will know how accurate this estimate also turns out

 He used to torture his subjects a lot
 uske atyaachaar se har koi behad pareshaan tha
 Despite being so tyrannical, Kansa loved his sister Devaki a lot
 kuch samay baad kansa ne apni bahan devaki kii shaadi vasudev ke saath tay kar di
 Kansa was extremely pleased with this relationship
 lekin kansa kii yah khushi zyada samay tak nahin tiki rah saki
 On the day of the wedding there was an All India Radio
 is akashwani ko sunne ke baad maano kansa kii duniya hill gai
 Actually, in this Akashvani, God warned Kansa that he would be slaughtered at the hands of the eighth child of Devaki
 ye sunate hi kansa krodh main aa gaya
 After this he locked Devaki and Vasudev in a dungeon in his palace
 apni matyu se bachane ke liye kansa ek ek karke devaki kii sabhi santanon kaa vadh karata rahaa
 Kansa was eagerly waiting for Devaki's eighth child to be born
 kuch samay baad ek andheri raat main devaki ne apni aathvi santan ko janm diya
 The eighth child of Devaki and Vasudeva was Shri Krishna
 bhagwaan ne apni maaya se sabhi paharedaaron ko behosh kar diya or vasudev shri krishna ko gokal chhod aae
 Now when Kansa came to know about this, he summoned the mystic demonic Pootna and ordered him to kill all the newborns of Gokal village
 bataa den, putana ko ye vardaan praapt tha ki wo apni ichha anusaar apana rup badal sakati he
 Now Pootna slowly started killing all the children of Gokal village
 iske baad ek din aakhirkaar putana yashoda- nand ke ghar krishna ko maarane ke liye bhi pahunch gai
 Putana tried to feed him poisonous milk to kill Shri Krishna, then Balagopal Krishna killed the demon
 putana kaa doodh pine kii vajah se shri krishna kaa sharir gahare nile rang kaa pad gaya tha
 Now Krishna, who looked gentle and beautiful, started appearing blue
 krishna is baat ko sweekaar nahin kar paa rahe the ki ab unka goraapan kahi lipt ho chukaa he
 He began to feel that neither Radha would like this form nor Gopis
 isaki vajah se wo sabase dur ho sakate hai
 After which Mata Yoshada advised Krishna to paint Radha in the same color in which he wants to see her
 tab krishna, radha ke paas gaye or unke upar dher sara rang udel diya
 After that one incident, the two fell in love with each other and since then this day was celebrated as a celebration of Holi
 bataa den, us din phalgun poornima kaa avasar tha, isliye holi kaa tyohaar hameshaa phalgun maheene main manaaya jaataa he
 Deepika Kumari, who is considered to be a strong contender for medals for India at the London Olympic Games, said she is not under pressure to be the world's number one archer and is committed to winning medals under any circumstances
 deepika ne kaha, ‘yah meraa pehla olympic he or isliye main aatmavishvaas se otprot hum

 mujhe pataa he ki main abhi duniya kii number ek teerandaaj hum or mujhase kaaphi apekshaayen kii ja rahi hai lekin iskaa mujh par kisi tarah kaa dabaav nahin he
 He said, 'being number one has boosted my confidence but i am not very happy with it
 mujhe sabase zyada olympic main swarna padak jeetne par hi milegi
 By the way, our aim is to get medals right now because we know that when archery has become an important sport in India with good performance in the World Cup, then at what height will the Olympic medal take the game
 ’deepika ne is saal turki ke antalya main mahila rickerv ke vyaktigat varg main dakshin korea kii lee sung jin ko haraakar swarna padak jeeta tha
 Due to this, she later also became the number one player in the world
 ranchi kii is 18 varshiya teerandaaj ne mana ki korian khilaadi par jeet se unka manobal badha he lekin ab bhi is asian desh ke teerandaajon ko hi apana kadaa pratidwandvi maanati hai
 These youngsters are also excited about doing archery at London's historic Lord's Ground, but they believe that it will be important to reconcile with the conditions there
 deepika ne kaha, ‘landan main mausam lagaataar badal jaataa he or isliye hamaare liye vahaan kii paristhitiyon se saamanjasy bithaana mahatvapurn hoga
 The archery competition will take place at the Lords and everyone is thrilled by it
 ’deepika ne kaha ki abhi vah apni kamajoriyon ko sudhaarney par dhyaan de rahi hai
 Right now our focus is on training and improving our technique as much as possible
 main apni kamiyon ko sudhaarney kii koshish kar rahi hum
