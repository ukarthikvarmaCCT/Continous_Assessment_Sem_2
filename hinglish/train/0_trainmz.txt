 isse pehle ki 'avatar' or uske parivaar ko prasiddhi milti or ve uskaa laabh uthaa pate, use khaarij kar diya gaya
 Madhagowda, the head of the Sathya Sai temple, established in 2003 in Baba's honor in Mandya, says, "it was only in 1963 that we were told that Baba's next incarnation would be in Mandya
 ab ham intjaar nahin kar sakate, mandya ko vardaan mila he
 Madhegowda quoted the details recorded in Sathya Sai Speaks, Volume 3
 is granth main saaf kaha gaya he ki 16 july, 1963 ko gurupurnima ke din baba ne apane bhakton ke bich ghoshnaa kii thi ki ve bangaloru or mysore (1972 main mysore ko karnataka naam de diya gaya) ke bich sthit mysore rajya main prem sai ke rup main punarjanm lenge
 It was estimated that the woman who gave birth to the next Sai Baba was born 15 years ago in that area
 baba ke ek bhakt ram pad kaa kahana he, ''baba ne bataaya he ki professor en
 Kasturi is reborn as that girl and she will give birth to the next incarnation of Baba
 '' ram pad kaa daawa he ki ve puttaparthi main satya sai baba kii jeevani lekhak kasturi se mil chuke hai
 But there are many inconsistencies among them
 baba ke jin pravachanon kaa dastavejikaran ho chukaa he unamem se kuch main is baat kaa zikr he ki 96 saal kii umr main jab ve ihalok chodenge uske aath saal baad unka aglaa avatar janm legaa
 Some other records mention that the next incarnation will take birth within a year of Baba's death
 baba ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki unki mrityu 96 saal kii umr main hogi lekin ve 85 saal kii umr main hi ihalok chhod gaye
 In such a situation, his devotees are in a state of confusion about his rebirth
 ab yah sambhaavna bataai ja rahi he ki unka punarjanm 2012, 2019 or 2030 main ho saktaa he
 Although this list does not include the year 2011, but when Baba was hospitalized this year, his devotees started searching for his next avatar
 mandya main sai ashram ke shraddhalu sai prasad kaa kahana he, ''jab satya sai baba ne 1926 main puttaparthi main janm liya tha tab kisi ko nahin maaloom tha ki ve shiridy ke sai baba ke avatar hai
 He announced it himself at the age of 14
 lihaaja, ab baba kii talash karne kaa koi matlab nahin he
 When the time comes, Baba will announce himself
 '' kinvadanti he ki satya sai baba ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki ve shiridy ke sai baba ke avatar hai
 But Sai Baba's devotees of Shirdi never considered Sathya Sai Baba as his avatar
 or to or, 2006 main maharashtra ke ahmednagar jile main raahata main unke shraddhaluon ne ek maamla daayar karke maang kii thi ki satya sai baba ke shraddhalu unhen shradike sai baba kaa avatar bataanaa band karen
 But this case could never reach the court
 ek shraddhalu or puttaparthi main divangat baba ke nivas sthal prasanti nilayam ke sadhak sai rajesh ram kaa kahana he, ''baba ne hameshaa kaha ki ve teen avtaron main se duusare hai
 The first was Shirdi's Baba, and the third would be Prem Sai Baba
 ''bataaya jaataa he ki satya sai baba ne 1970 main apane shraddhalu jon hislop ko ek anguthi di thi, jisamen unke agle avatar kii aspasht chhavi thi
 That image kept changing over time and then began to appear as a bearded young man
 hislop ne apni pustak maai baba and aai main likhaa he, ''us chhavi main saumy chehre, kandhe tak bal, moonch dadhi vaala vyakti he or uskaa asana camel he yaa vah usase ubhar rahaa he
 "according to Hislop, Baba told him," Now that he is in the process of being born, i cannot show him more now
 use pehali baar duniya ko dikhaaya gaya he
 By 1980, Hislop was convinced that the face had taken shape
 1995 menhislop kii maut cancer se ho gai or us anguthi kaa abhi tak koi pataa thikaana nahin he, haalanki puttaparthi ashram ke log kai rekhachitr pesh kar chuke hai
 "in 1940, Puttaparthi was a village with no electricity, no water," says Sai Lokesh Murthy, head of the Sai temple in Bangalore
 koi akhbaar nahin tha or televijan to tha hi nahin
 Yet Baba had no problem in understanding the people about his divinity
 aaj, prem sai pehle se hi vikipedia main jagah paa chuke hai
 i am sure a Facebook page will also be created soon
 or tithi yaa saal ke bare main koi bhram nahin he
 The gods compute their way, which does not necessarily match our calculations
 '' 64 varshiya murti ne is saal ke aakhir tak kaveri ke paas shrirangapattan main deraa daalane or vahiin avatar kaa intjaar karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Like millions of other people, anyone can join it
 ek ore jahaan satya sai baba ke avatar ko lekar bahes jari he, vahiin puttaparthi main satta kaasangharsh chhidaa hua he
 Doubts are emerging about the future of his empire and its management
 baba ne shiksha, swasthya or kalyaan ke jo kaarykram chalaae unamem unke parivaar ne nunatam bhoomika nibhaai
 Now it is trying to capture the network of various institutions
 isamen sabase aage unke bhattije aar
 J
 ratnakar hai, jo prabhaavshaalee shri satya sai central trust (esaxssiti) ke sadsy or anantpur jile main congress ke kaaryakarta hai
 He was inducted into the trust only last year, while his father and Sai Baba's brother Janakiram died five years ago
 janakiram baba ke parivaar ke iklaute aise vyakti the jinhen unke samrajya kii gatividhiyon main shaamil karne kii ijaajat di gai thi
 Another member of the family wants to play the lead role and they are Chetna Raju
 sai baba kii badi bahan parvatamma kii potee chetana raju sai baba kii maa ishwarmma ke naam se ek mahila kalyaan trust chalaati hai
 Apart from him is Satyajit, a personal servant who took care of Sai Baba for a decade, who has been closest to him in recent years
 sathyajith paanch saal kii umr main puttaparthi aae the or unhone shri satya sai institute of hair larning se emb kiya
 He decided to serve Sathya Sai's institutions and then engaged himself in the service of Sathya Sai

 ratnakar, sathyajith or chetana dastak de rahe hai lekin trustee philhal unhen niyantran saunpane main anakani karte najar aarahe hai
 In the first meeting held on 26 April after the demise of Sai Baba, the trustees declared that "in the absence of personal guidance of Lord Sri Sathya Sai Baba, the future work is undoubtedly huge and complex
" ''trustiyon ne antim sanskaar se 24 ghante pehle taiyaar masaude se bhavi ashankaon ko dur kar diya
 He said that he would work with humility in unison with Baba's guidance and inspiration, so that the trust he had set up would translate the difficult and impossible tasks into reality
 ''unhone elaan kiya ki ve nirantarata ke sathsath parivartan ke liye koshish kar rahe hai
 The transition period was said with reverence: "our most revered founding trustee God has left his body and returned to his natural state of pure universal consciousness
 aise main ham trustee or council of management ke sadsy ke rup main apana pehla or sabase jaruri kaam yah samajhte hai ki apane shraddhey bhagwaan baba ke prati shradhanjali darj karen
 Also, express our deep gratitude to him that he gave us an opportunity to play a role in his great mission to serve humanity, however small it may be
 ''ek ore jahaan esaxssiti ne sai baba kii bhautik anupasthiti main sari gatividhiyon ko chalaane ke liye vyavastha taiyaar kar lee he, vahiin ratnakar, sathyajith or chetana apane prabhaav hnetra banane or trustiyon ko peedigat badlaav karne ke liye raji karne kii koshish karenge
 Ratnakar has started as a trustee and Congress worker, while others have the support of devotees of Sathya Sai Baba
 ratnakar kii paripakvata yaa uski kami se tay hoga ki puraane anbhavi log unka maargdarshan karte rahenge yaa nahin
 He does not consider Satyajit or Chetna a serious threat, but he fears that the influential K
 chakravarti un donon kaa samarthan kar sakate hai
 Discipline of devotees and staunch followers of Sai Baba will be a hindrance for Ratnakar and those who try to get out of the way already mentioned in the quest for personal domination
 lekin yah lambey samay tak nahin rah saktaa
 If allegations of mismanagement began to emerge in Sai's institutions and the management chiefs started separating, then there would be a storm of problems in the kingdom of Sai
 satya sai baba kii viraasat kaa prabandhan karne vaale logon ke liye fori chunauti yah vyavastha karne kii he ki esaxssiti, duusare trust or vibhinn sansthaaen paardarshita ke saath kaam karen
 According to estimates, around Rs 40,000 crore

 kaa videshi chanda mila tha

 Significantly, the SSSCT had urged the Andhra Pradesh government in 1980 that it should be exempted from regularly filing reports with the Hindu Religious and Khairati Charity Department of the state
 em
 The request was accepted by the Congress government led by Channa Reddy
 ek ore jahaan satya sai baba ke samrajya par kabja jamaane kii hode bad rahi he, vahiin is ashanka ke kaaran lagata he ki sthiti haath se nahin niklegi ki andhra pradesh sarkaar hindu dharmik evam khayrati dharmadaa kanoon, 1959 kaa hawala dekar sai samrajya ko apane kabje main le sakati he
 This would be a final denial of the legacy of Sathya Sai Baba, who had created a kingdom within the state during his lifetime

 At the same time, bjp's lawyer S

 In fact, through the petition, the BJP party had challenged the move of the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government to refuse to allow its rally
 kapur ne adaalat se kaha ki rajya sarkaar ne apane daawey ke samarthan main koi vastunishth tathy nahin rakhaa he or vah raily karne se ek rajnithik dal ko roak rahi he jabaki samvidhan yah adhikaar detaa he
 Advocate General Kishore Dutta submitted a sealed report to the court and said that the publication of the yatra in the BJP prospectus is of a communally sensitive nature
 unhone daleel di thi ki prashasnic faisle main adaalat ke paas nyaayik samiksha karne kaa simit dayera he
 He said that since 2017, 2100 permission has been granted for various political rallies and gatherings in West Bengal but in this case, the Rath Yatra was not allowed due to the blindness

 sandvalakar ne ajtak ko bataaya ki wo 2001 main pehali baar dow
 Virendra Singh met Tawde
 wo khud bhi dakshinpanthi vichaardhaara kaa he, isliye taavade se uski dosti ho gai

 unhone kaha ki logon ko is ghatana par unke vichaar jaanane ke liye unki kitaab kaa intjaar karnaa chahie

 Harbhajan was suspended while he remained silent

 The most exciting and long awaited match of the 12th edition of the Asia Cup will be played in Mirpur on Sunday
 donon timen ek-ek match jeet chuki hai or ek-ek match main donon kii haar hui he
 In such a situation, this match is like a semi-final for both teams
 jo jitegaa, vah khitaab kii ore kadam badhayega
 India defeated Bangladesh in their first match
 us match main bhartiya captain viraat kohli ne shatak lagaaya tha or is team ne apane yuva captain kii dekharekh main prabhaavshaalee pradarshan kiya tha
 India's defeat at the hands of Sri Lanka put a question mark on the journey ahead but the Indian team lost by playing well
 duusari ore, pakistan ko apane pehle mukaable main srilanka ke haathon haar mili thi lekin usne afghanistan ko apane duusare mukaable main haraakar isaki bharpai karne ko koshish kii
 In the event of defeating India, his campaign to save the title will become a bit easier as he has to face Bangladesh next and defeating the hosts will not be a difficult task for him

 The cricket festival in Fatullah is over and now the festival will continue in Mirpur
 mirpur or dhaka vaasi bhaagyashaalee hai ki unhen do chir pratidwandviyon ke bich kaa hai voltage muqabla dekhne ko milegaa
 Whenever there was a fight between India and Pakistan for a long time, it was described as a war between Indian batsmen and Pakistani bowlers, but this time things have changed a bit
 bhartiya ballebaaji kram anubhav ke lihaaj se bahut aage nahin he or na hi pakistani akraman pankti bahut adhik jaan rakhti he
 This time the Indian team has a slightly heavier look as Pakistan's middle order is less experienced than that and the bowlers are also not very experienced
 said ajmal or umr gul ko chhod den to sabhi gendbaaj lagbhag nae hai or bharat ke khilaaf kam hi khele hai
 On the other hand, the Indian bowlers are also new to the Pakistani batsmen and hence the Indian captain can land a fast bowler like Varun Aaron on a relatively fast pitch of Mirpur, who was not fed against Sri Lanka
 mirpur main bharat or pakistan ke bich antim muqabla march 2012 main hua tha
 It was the last ODI match of India's great batsman Sachin Tendulkar
 sachin ab cricket ko alavida kah chuke hai

 Thanks to Kohli's stormy century, India achieved the target of 330 runs with 13 balls remaining
 rohit sharma ne 68 ran banaae the
 Now these two players would like to bring their team to victory, once again refreshing the memory of that match

 If Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is a strong contender in next year's UP assembly elections, then there is a history of Dalit politics behind it
 iske saath hi bispi pramukh mayawati ke paas bhi pichley kareeb teen dashakon main jabardast sangharsh ke boote satta tak pahunchane tak kii takat ko bachaae rakhane kii mushkil chunauti he
 They are also struggling
 asal main unka yah utthan pichley teen dashakon main desh main dalit raajnneeti ke dhardaar ubhaar ke saath-saath unki chunauti kii bhi kahani kahata he
 Today, Dalit politics is so important and sharp that in the pages of the past, the association with Bhimrao Ambedkar and its representatives, who are fiercely opposed, is trying to grab the legacy of Ambedkar
 yun hi nahin, bijepi or sangh kii ranneeti main dalit bhi pramukhataa se chhaae hue hai—isamen ambedkar jayanti se lekar upi main dhakvam chetana yatra tak shaamil he
 At the same time, if Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke the silence in the name of cow protection, that too after the brutal beating of Dalits in Una
 iske baad hi aakhirkaar gujarat kii mukhyamantri anandiben patel ko soshal media par hi apane istife kii ghoshnaa kerani padi
 Similarly, in the last two years after coming to power, if any public outrage has stirred the cries of the NDA government, then they are Una and Rohit Vemula movement
 jaahir he, vartmaan paridrishy main rajnatik or saamaajik taur par agar dalit is haisiyat tak pahunche hai to is badlaav ke liye pichley teen dashak behad mahatvapurn rahe hai
 If you look back, the eyes stop at Kanshi Ram
 ambedkar ke baad kanshiram hi aise shakchas the, jo kadi mehnat se jamini str par daliton ke liye badlaav kii bayaar le aae, kam se kam uttar pradesh main to jarur
 In 1982, in his book, The Chamcha Age, he criticized how Dalit leaders work for the traditional mainstream party by ignoring the interests of their community
 yah najariya hi unka iraadaa jaahir karata he
 In 1984, he founded BSP
 mukhyadhara ke akhabaaron ne ise kabhi gambhirtha se nahin liya
 But the party workers conveyed their message among the Bahujan society
 1988 ke elahabaad ke upachunaav main party kaa ek ahm naaraa deevaaron par likhaa tha—'vot hamaara, raaj tumhaara, nahin chalegaa, nahin chalegaa'
 She won 67 seats in the 1993 UP Legislative Assembly and Mayawati became the first Dalit Chief Minister of UP on June 3, 1995, at the age of just 39, with the support of the BJP after the attack on her supporters
 iske baad 1997 or phir 2002 main ve mukhyamantri baniin
 The ever-shilthik, scales and talwar, hit them with shoes, chanting slogans and aggressively talking of 'bahujan', the BSP later came up with the vision of 'sarvajan' and completed 206 out of 403 assembly seats in UP in 2007
 Formed a majority government
 rajya main jagah-jagah bhavy dalit smarak banavaakar bispi ne dalit raajnneeti kaa ek chakra puraa kar liya
 This is the story of change through vote in UP, and the last three decades have been full of social change in the social change of Dalits in Bihar
 jameen, adhikaar or sakvamaan kii is ladaai kii parinti kai baar dalit narsanhaar ke rup main dikhi
 In this, there was a fierce ambush in the armies of the upper caste and the organization of the Dalit-backward castes
 sattar ke dashak ke aakhir main shuru hua narsanhaaron kaa silsilaa 2000 main aurangabad ke miyampur tak jari rahaa
 Ram Vilas Paswan emerged as a Dalit face in Bihar during the political uplift of the backward, whose party LJP won 29 seats in the 2005 assembly elections to the status of kingmaker in the state but decided not to join the power and in the next election the party Bad fate happened
 ab jo bhi taatkaalik vajah ho, nitish kumaar ne 2014 main anaam-se jeethanram maanjhi ko mukhyamantri kii gaddi saunp di
 But when Manjhi blew the bugle against Nitish, he had to face it
 vahiin paswan bhi mahaj 'siyaasi mausam ke purvanumaan karne vaale' tak simat gaye hai
 Similarly, the Republican Party of India, which was associated with Ambedkar in Maharashtra, was divided into several pieces
 kendriya raajnneeti main agar ramdaas athawale hai bhi to bijepi ke saath bandhe hue
 There has been a big change in Dalits in the field of education
 sangh lokseva 2015 main 22 varshiya tina daabi kaa awwal number par rahanaa shiksha or sarkari naukari main daliton kii dhamak kii misaal he
 In 1991, the literacy rate of Dalits was just 37
 41 thi or dalit mahilaon kii to sirf 23
 76
 lekin 2001 tak aate-aate sakshartaa dar main vruddhi ke maamle main daliton ne baakiyon ko peeche chhod diya
 In 2001, the literacy rate of Dalits increased by 46 percent, while the total national literacy rate was just 24 percent
 isi tarah, 2011 main daliton kii sakshartaa dar main kareeb 20 fisadi vruddhi hui to kul rashtriya sakshartaa dar main mahaj 14 fisadi
 Similarly, the participation of Dalits has increased significantly in the last decade from higher education to higher secondary
 misaal ke taur par 2001 ke mukaable 2011 main snaatak yaa usase upar kii padhai karne vaale daliton kii sankhya jahaan 139 fisadi badi he to desh main kul aise logon main 81 fisadi kii hi vruddhi hui he
 Clearly, their growth in the last three decades in terms of education is vigorous
 lekin iske ulat daliton par atyaachaar aaj bhi badastoor jari he
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), in 2015, a total of 45,003 cases have been registered against Dalits in the country
 vahiin 1991 main jab pehali baar enciarabi main daliton ke khilaaf aparaadh ke aankade ikattha kiye gaye to yah 18,336 thi, jo 1994 main 33,908 ho gai thi
 According to Dalit thinkers, there are two important reasons for this - first, with the awareness coming, the Dalits started registering their cases, the second was that with the upliftment and raising of the Dalits, the upper castes became aggressive towards them
 una or vemula mudde par desh main jis tarah aakrosh barapa vah daliton kii nai peedi kii dhamaakedaar upasthiti kii vajah se he
 The underprivileged has made technology, social media an important weapon
 philhal nijee kshetra main behad hi kam bhagidaari milane ke baavjood dalit vahaan upasthiti darj kara rahe hai

 5 lakh dalit udhyami the, jo 2006-7 main 28 lakh paar kar gaye or ve kareeb 25 fisadi kii dar se bad rahe hai
 In the political scenario, after the 2009 UP assembly elections and the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the next assembly election is a tough challenge for the BSP
 dalit raajnneeti ke saath-saath aaj daliton ke saamne kai chunautiyaan hai (padhein sukhdev thoraat kaa lekh) par iske baavjood pichley teen dashakon main daliton ne saamaajik-rajnatik taur par kuch ullekhneey uplabdhiyaan hasil kii hai

 The Shravasti assembly seat is occupied by bjp's Ram Ferran who defeated Samajwadi Party's Mohammad Rizwan in the last election by a narrow margin of 445 votes
 dharmik nagari tulsipur vidhansabha seat par bhi bijepi ke naam he jinhone 2 saal pehle hue chunaav main kailash nath shukla ne congress ke jeba rigwan ko 18,659 maton se haraaya tha
 The Gyanasari constituency falling in Balrampur district comes under the Shravasti Lok Sabha constituency and the constituency is dominated by bjp's Shailesh Kumar Singh MLA who defeated BSP candidate Alauddin by a margin of 2,303 votes

 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke aadhaar par dekha jaae to ek seat par muslim vidhayak he to 3 siton par muslim ummidavaar duusare number par rahe the
 In such a situation, after the entry of SP-BSP alliance and Priyanka Gandhi in Congress before the next general elections, the path here has become very difficult for BJP
 2017 ke voton ko jod diya jaae to sapa-basapa ke khate main 45 fisadi se zyada vot jaataa he jo bijepi ko mili vot se kahin zyada he
 In such a situation, it is not easy for the BJP, then the path may be easier for the SP-BSP alliance

 Please tell that the martyr Aurangzeb, who was awarded the Shaurya Chakra, was kidnapped and killed by terrorists last year
 mohammad hanif bijepi se santusht hai
 They feel that if any government can work in Kashmir against the terrorists, it is the BJP and the BJP wants to give Hanif the message that the families of the martyred soldiers are supporters of the BJP
 iskaa loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko kitna phayda milegaa ye to samay batayega magar itnaa jarur he ki piem modi kii raily ko lekar hurriyat kii saansen ataki hui hai
 The Hurriyat has called a shutdown in Kashmir today

 It has a bearing not only on the final decisions of the High Courts of the States (there are a total of 18 High Courts for 28 States and Union Territories) but also on panchayats (state and Central) across the country
 aisi saikadon panchat desh main kaam kar rahi hai
 Apart from this, the law made by the Supreme Court and its interpretation on the validity of existing laws is binding on all courts and tribunals of the country under the Constitution

 iske baavjood pichley 10 saal ke dauraan hamaare sthapit kanoonee tantra par logon kaa bharosa kam hua he kyonki kanoon to tamaam bane, lekin nyaay us anupaat main nahin mila
 All things were done, but there was no judicial reform
 hamen ab aage badhanaa hogaah kuch hat ke karnaa hoga, aisa jo hamane pehle kabhi nahin kiya
 Broadly, i am suggesting something
 *nyaay dene main lagane vaale lambey samay main katautee hoh hamaare yahaan jaisi tristareey pichley faislon par aadhaarit nyaay vyavastha he, usamen mukademe lambey khinchate chale jate hai
 One of the main reasons for this is that lawyers waste a lot of time in quoting old judgments and laws related to their cases
 pichley kuch varshon ke dauraan hamaare yahaan jo kanoonee reportein prakashit hui hai, unamem kuch upyogi faisle hai to adhiktar anupayogi bhi hai
 In the US, there was a similar problem before, but to stop the flood of earlier decisions there has been strictly implemented a judicial tool called "unpublishing of judgments"
 aprakashan kaa matlab yah hua ki kisi mukademe se sambhddha faisla yaa nyaayik raay sirf usee maamle ke tathyon tak simit he, lihaaja use sarkari lau report main prakaashan ke upyukt nahin mana jaataa he
 When this is put in the category of 'unpublished' judgment on the website, no lawyer can cite it in the court
 yah america main kaaphi kargar sabit hua he
 The US federal courts 'rate of unpublished rulings' currently stands at 80 per cent
 bharat main aisa karne ke liye kaaphi mehnat kerani hogi
 After thousands of decisions, they have to be declared 'unpublished', but this effort will be quite effective
 isse mukademon ko nibatane main hone vaali deree se bachaa ja sakavga
 * The tendency to constitute arbitrations within the judicial system should be curbed: Most petitioners feel that they will get justice only in the High Court or the Supreme Court, even though in the Appellate Tribunals, retired judges of the higher courts decide
 aise adhikranon main aane vaale adhiktar maamalon par die gaye faisle ko yachikakarta ucch nyaayalay main chunauti detaa he (anuchhed 226 main varnit rit yachikaaon ke tahat) or aakhirkaar use supreme court main le jaataa he (anuchhed 136 ke tahat)
 In this way it is too late to make a final decision and in the process these Appellate Tribunals become irrelevant
 *galat yachikaaon par harjaana lageh hamaari nyaayik vyavastha kii ek badi vifaltaa yah he ki kanoon main vyavastha hone ke baavjood galatiyon ke liye keemat nahin maangi jaati
 Unconfirmed petitions made under any apprehension and fear of penalties should arise in the mind of the person filing the PIL
 masalan, sarkaron dwaara banaai gai pariyojnaayen or kyrkram sirf bhrashtachar kii ashanka par hycourt (or supreme court main) main daali gai yachikaaon ke chalate barason atake rahete hai or aise maamalon main yachikakartaon kaa koi pratyaksh hit nahin hota
 When such public interest petitions are dismissed at the end of a tragic judicial process, it is impossible to compensate communities in the meantime for the damage that the project has caused
 *nyaayadhishon kii niyukti ke liye nyaayadhishon kii sifarish kii prakriya par roak lageh oonchi adaalaton main jajon kii niyukti kaa jo maujuuda tarika he, vah apraasangik ho chukaa he
 High court and Supreme Court judges are capable of handling the cases before them, but experience shows that they cannot be trusted in making binding recommendations for the appointment of higher judiciary
 *hycorton main jahaan pehle hi mukademon kaa ambara laga hua he, baar ke pratishthit or anbhavi sadasyon ko do, teen yaa paanch saal ke liye jaj niyukt kiya ja saktaa he or is pad se mukt hone ke baad ve usee court main dobaaraa vakaalat kar saken, aisi vyavastha di ja sakati he
 This will make a big difference in the speed of handling cases in the High Courts
 *jaj (sangrakshan) kanoon 1985 ko khatm karen: is kanoon ne pehali baar vyavastha di thi ki apane nyaayik kaary nishpaadan ke dauraan kisi bhi vartmaan yaa purv jaj dwaara kii gai kisi bhi gatividhi, kaam, kahe gaye shabd ke liye koi bhi adaalat divaani yaa faujadaari maamle kii sunwaayee nahin karegi
 "honorable judges" (believe me, there are many) do not need such additional protection
 iske alaava 1985 kaa yah kanoon jis sadichha se banaaya gaya tha, us hisaab se yah ab apraasangik ho chukaa he kyonki yah kuch mutthi bhar galat karne waalon ke liye dhaal kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 The Judges Inquiry Act of 1968 exists to secure the independence of already functioning judges and i believe this law should be upheld as it complicates the last step in the process of removal of judges of higher courts
 - And it should be so that the independence of the judges can be preserved
 isaki jagah jis judicious standerds and acountibility bill 2010 ko laane kii baat kii ja rahi he, vah kaaphi kharaab vikalp hoga
 This bill has created more problems than solving problems
 isliye ise waapas le liya janaa chahie yaa khaarij kar diya janaa chahie
 The final point is that judicial reform is not just about the speedy handling of lawsuits
 21veen sadi kii nyaay vyavastha ko aatmanushasan ke maamle main bhi nazeer kaayam kerani hogi yani uske saamne jo kanoonee samasyaayein paidaa hon (jo ki akasar kanoonee or rajnatik donon hoti hai) unke prati anushaasan barte
 Apart from this, there is also a need to create more transparency in the lifestyle of judges and tolerance of public criticism
 pehle yachikakarta jis tarah se jaj kaa faisla maan liya karata tha, ab aisa nahin he
 The sheet of the highest purity and sovereignty that was once the judicial system, has come down
 ab faisle dena mushkil kaam ho chalaa he
 There has been a growing trend of a judge accepting the judge as a normal human being if the party loses the case
 log use ab vyavastha kaa nishpaksh or bina laag-lapet vaala agent nahin maanate
 That is, the target is no longer on the ball, but on the player
 isiilie kuch naitik upadeshon or upar se neeche kii ore jane vaale disha-nirdeshon kii jarurat aan padi he (jise 'sheersh' par baithe logon ko bhi maananaa hoga)
 The way our country is and as time goes on, it is not enough to just keep the judiciary independent from the executive and other external influences
 jis oonche pad par hamaare nyaayadhish hote hai or jaise adhikaar unhen praapt hai, uske hisaab se unhen dil or dimag donon ke str par behtareen gunvattta vaala hona chahie
 More than that, they should be courageous
 sabase badi adaalat main sajjanta or saahas ho, to neeche kii ore ye gun apane aap chhan-chhanakar chale aate hai
 In view of the importance of judiciary in this country, a biblical statement and the warning given immediately after it fit, meaning something like this - "you are the hope of the earth, but if you leave the hope Then who will bind you around? '' baat 14 may kii he
 Nitish Kumar was seen folding his hands in front of the Buddha statue in Patna's Buddha Smriti Park and praying with his eyes closed for 36 hours before the marginalized counting of votes

 And on May 17, he resigned as Chief Minister and changed Andeshe to truth

 This was a large proportion of 17 per cent of Muslims and 12 per cent of Mahadalits, who on paper saw them invincible
 lekin chunaav ke pehle hi daur main sanket mil gaya ki musalamaanon ne lalu-congress gathjod ko chunaa he or ibisi kaa ek varg narendra modi ke samarthan main de rahaa he
 Now it has also been proved that Nitish's entire mathematics went haywire
 bijepi ne nitish par jab yah aarope lagaaya ki ve uske pichhadi jati ke netaa yani modi ko pradhanmantri banane se rokane kii koshish kar rahe hai to badi sankhya main ibisi voter nitish se chhitak gaye
 Not only this, the Muslims returned to Lalu

 The BJP broke even the most marginalized castes like the nbc's Nishad and took along the traditionally considered castes
 vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki modi ke pichhadi jati or unke vikaas purush hone ko prachaarit karke bijepi ne aisa aadhaar taiyaar kiya jisamen jati aadhaarit samaaj kii kai paraten shaamil thim
 Nitish wrote the script of his downfall himself, moving fast with the help of the alliance

 As soon as the Union Cabinet approved the decision to create a separate Telangana state from Andhra Pradesh, its opposition has started on the streets
 aise main telugana gathan par ahm bhoomika adaa karne vaale congress ke varisht netaa or mahasachiv digvijay singh se enditivi ke political editor manoranjan bharti ne baatcheet kii
 
 
 Manoranjan Bharti: What policies are going on about Andhra Pradesh, Andhra is burning, there is no electricity, children are in incubators, what are we waiting for? digvijay singh : telugana aaj kaa vishay nahin he
 Telangana has been in demand since the time the state formation commission was first formed and in that he mentioned about Telangana
 samay−samay par telugana kii maang uthati rahi he
 There was a demand on this subject, some agreements were followed, some were not
 90 ke aakhri dashak main andhra pradesh ke congress vidhayakon ne jab wiesar reddy congress ke vipaksh ke netaa the, us samay raashtrapati ke paas 40 se zyada vidhayakon ne telugana kii maang kaa aavedan diya tha, tab se ye maang he
 In the 2004 election, the Congress party also included him in the election manifesto
 tab mananeey raashtrapati ji ke abhibhaashan main bhi iskaa ullekh hua
 In 2007–08, the Center entrusted this task to Pranab Mukherjee to discuss Telangana and discussed with all parties
 sabhi ne sahmati bhi jataai
 Then a meeting of all the parties was called
 jab scindia mantri the tab sabhi ne sahmati jataai, par sipiem nahin de pai
 Earlier, Chidambaram gave a statement
 unhone shri krishna kamishan banaaya
 One of those six recommendations was from Telangana
 is par charchaa chalati rahi, aakhir main jab sabaki sahmati ai, tab congress ne faisalaa liya
 Before the decision, the CM, Deputy CM, Congress Committee President was given an opportunity to present his matter in front of the Core Committee
 manoranjan bharti : aapane kaha sabhi dalon ne sahmati di
 Just issued two letters
 aapkaa kahana he ki jagan or chandrababu naidu, jo dharne par hai, apni baat se peeche hat rahe he? Digvijay Singh: This is purely political opportunism
 ye chitthee likhane ke baad peeche kyon hat rahe hai? agar koi samasya he to bataaen
 We will resolve, but do not give provocative statements in which people in Seemandhra suffer
 manoranjan bharti : bhadakaane vaale bayaan to
 
 
 Give more digvijay singh : wo bhi galat he
 We also oppose that
 kesiar ne jis tarah kaa bayaan or unki party ne jo vyavhaar kiya he wo uchit nahin hai
 Manoranjan Bharti: Isn't it a problem that CM is not in your court, the report is coming out
 yahaan tak ki vidhaan dal kii baithak main bhi party ne baahar ek nayaa dal banaaya
 Digvijay Singh: This is bad news
 alag dal kaa na to nirnay hua, na kabhi kisi ne is par vichaar bhi kiya
 This is wrong
 manoranjan : aapako lagata he ki andhra ke mukhyamantri aapke saath sahyog kar rahe hai
 Digvijay Singh: They are definitely working in difficult times
 manoranjan : lekin jis dhang se vahaan blike out he, aspataalon main bijli nahin he, kya unako esama nahin lagaana chahie
 Digvijay Singh: Esma has been put in place, but Esma is a Draconian law, discussion is a medium through which a solution can be found
 isse bijli vibhaag ke kamarchaariyon se baat hui he
 The required service has been started
 aspataal chaalu ho gaye hai
 Power supply has started in many places at airports and trains
 abhi bhi unhone puure tareeke se andolan waapas nahin liya he
 NGO strikes are also being talked about
 uskaa samaadhaan jaldi karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Manoranjan Bharti: Is there scope for a rethink? digvijay singh : punarvichaar kii gunjaaish nahin he
 Small parties can reverse the decision, but the credibility of the Congress is different, so we do not reverse by saying
 manoranjan : yadi sthiti bigadati he ,to raashtrapati shashan kaa vikalp he? Digvijay Singh: President's rule should be the last option
 puraa vishwaas hona chahie ki janata dwaara chuni sarkaar kaam kare
 Manoranjan Bharati: You just created a kingdom
 aapke rahete bana
 There was no protest
 bihar main bhi bana puraa bijness chalaa gaya koi virodh nahin hua
 Now when the poor want to create a poor state like Telangana, are the reddy people who are five to six percent, are they angry because they are going to power, they have political-economic power? digvijay singh : reddy telugana andhra tathaa simandhra sabhi jagah hai, isliye wo jati vishesh kaa vishay nahin hai, alag rajya banane se simandhra ke logon ko haidarabad ke maamle se pareshaani he
 On the matter of sharing of water and resources, i would like to say that the people of Seemandhra who are settled in Hyderabad will get justice
 main simandhra ke logon ko aashwast karnaa chahta hum ki unako koi nuksaan nahin hoga or unke saath kisi bhi kism kaa bhedbhaav nahin hoga
 There will also be no discrimination in matters of education, health and job
 10 saal tak hyderabad donon rajyon kii saajha rajdhani rahegi
 Manoranjan Bharti: What will be the attitude of Congress with Jagan
 aisa lag rahaa he ki jagan mohan reddy congress ke prati naram rukh akhriyaar kiye hue hai
 Digvijay Singh: As far as Jagan is concerned, his motto is Congress
 haalanki jagan ne kuch galat kaam kiye the, jisaki vajah se use kai kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, lekin jo vyakti congress kaa he, wo sampradayik nahin ho saktaa
 Manoranjan Bharti: What do you think will happen soon in Andhra Pradesh? digvijay singh : is maamle par main kahuunga ki hamen ummid va koshish donon karnaa chahie Manoranjan Bharti: Are you constantly in touch with the Chief Minister
 digvijay singh : haa main mukhyamantri ke sampark main hum
 Manoranjan Bharti: How do you see the style of what Rahul Gandhi said on the issue of ordinance brought on tainters? digvijay singh : rahul gandhi ne behad ahm mudda uthaaya he, pataa nahin log ise kitna samaj paae hai
 If we start compromising for small short term benefits, then we will never be able to end corruption, so there should be fight for corruption or loss
 manoranjan bharti : rahul gandhi ne yuva netaa ke taur par jo tevar dikhaae wo shaayad bahut saare logon ko acha nahin laga hoga is par aapaki pratikriya kya he? Digvijay Singh: See, those who are not considering Rahul's attitude well, they should understand what is the basic feeling behind it, the basic feeling was that there was no need for it and all this is happening against such people But there are many allegations
 isliye jo nirnay unhone liya or jis tarah se apni baat rakhi usamen koi buraai nahin he
 Manoranjan Bharti: The CBI says that allegations are not made against Mayawati and Rahul says that Mayawati does not allow Dalits to come forward, these are two different ideologies, a bit skeptical? digvijay singh : koi sanshay nahin he, jahaan tak mayawati kaa sawaal he, ve kanshiram ji kii dharohar par kaayam hai, mayawati apni hi tarah kii raajnneeti karatin hai
 What is the reason that BSP could not proceed in any other state except Uttar Pradesh
 duusare rajyon main bhi anusuchit jati ke bahut se log rahete hai, madhya pradesh main bhi 16 fisadi log anusuchit jatiyon se aate hai, mayawati kii raajnneeti apni tarah kii he, lekin congress kii vichaardhaara alag he, jo mahatma gandhi or pandit nehru se prerit he or unheen ke bataae raaston par chalati he na ki jaat−paat ke hisaab se
 
 
 Manoranjan Bharti: So will the BSP not be with the Congress in the 2014 elections? digvijay singh : koi bhi raajnneeti sambhaavnaaon ke aadhaar par hoti he or agar abhi dekha jaae to jo ghatnaayen uttar pradesh main huin hai ,ek churaasi kosi yatra jisaki maang vishwa hindu parishad ke dwaara kii gai thi or aise samay main maang kii gai jab chaturmaas chal rahaa tha, aise main koi bhi sadhu sant naala yaa nadi tak paar nahin karte hai, ye yatra pehle bhi hoti ai he, lekin ye hameshaa caitra baisaakh or ramanavami ke aas−paas hoti he, pehle sapa ne ashok sinhal se mulaaqaat kii phir unhen giraftaar bhi kar liya or phir press conference kii ijazat bhi di
 If the SP wanted to stop the visit, then why did it allow the press conference
 isse mujhe match fixing kii shankaa hoti he
 Similarly, the incident in Muzaffarnagar had been going on for several days
 lagaataar bavaal ho rahaa tha, isamen samay par karrwai ho jaati to baat itani nahin badhati
 Manoranjan Bharati: Whose hand do you see behind both these incidents
 jo satta main hai, unka yaa phir bijepi kaa
 Digvijay Singh: The BJP is truly involved in this, because BJP and Narendra Modi know that their politics cannot run in this country without rioting
 bijepi or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne hameshaa bekasooron kii laash par raajnneeti kii he
 This has always been his endeavor and will remain so
 manoranjan bharti : to phir aap ise kaise rokenge? Digvijay Singh: As far as non-congress states are concerned, it is up to them, but the states where Congress is ruled are responsible for law and order
 inke kilaaf sakhti se karrwai kii jaani chahie, isliye sampradayik takatein chahen kisi bhi kaum kii hon sab par nazar rakhni chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti: What do you want to say about Narendra Modi? digvijay singh : modi gujarat ke vikaas model kii baat karte hai, lekin haqiqat main gujarat main vikaas hua hi nahin he, modi gujarat main vikaas ke jhuthe vaade karte hai, aaj gujarat ke har naagarik par desh ke kisi bhi naagarik se zyada karz he
 Also, when Modi came in government, the debt on Gujarat was twenty two thousand crores, which has now been one lakh forty thousand crores
 manoranjan bharti : ye to dadli cocktail he yadi aap vikaas kii baaten jod den to koi or rasta nahin bachataa
 Digvijay Singh: We have come fighting a battle of ideology, there is no stain on our personality, but this person continues to glorify himself, understand one thing that the hand that has fed this person, this That same hand has been eaten, we do not consider Modi a challenge, Modi is a challenge for the BJP itself
 manoranjan bharti : muzaffarnagar main aaj ke samay main jo maahaul he usamen samaaj bat gaya he
 What would you say on this digvijay singh : dangon se un logon ko faaydaa hota he jo hindu or muslimon ke bantwaare kii raajnneeti karte hai
 The Congress party always carries with both communities, remember that in the atmosphere of rioting, there is always applause for those who spread communalism
 manoranjan bharti : rahul gandhi bhi gujarat gaye the or kaha tha ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav karo yaa maro kii tarj par honge
 Digvijay Singh: The 2014 election will not be on the lines of do or die, this slogan was to drive away the British rule
 aaj to aisi koi baat nahin he, raajnneeti main ham log apana−apana kaam karte hai
 They fight their own battles and the public accepts the decision
 manoranjan bharti : agar ye chunaav karo yaa maro kii tarj par nahin hoga to kya kaaryakarta niraash nahin ho jaaenge? Digvijay Singh: Our fight is a battle of ideology, the ideology that killed Gandhi, our fight will always be against that ideology
 
 
 manoranjan bharti : adhyadesh par rahul kaa bayaan buudhvaar kii raily main unka sapa or basapa ko target karnaa to kya ab ye samajha jaae ki jo congress party ko rahul hi chalaa rahe hai
 
 digvijay singh : jahaan tak sarkaar kii baat he, to wo manmohan singh chalaa rahe hai, sonia ji ne rahul ko jo zimmedaari saunpi thi, use rahul nibhaa rahe hai
 
 
 Manoranjan Bharti: Ajay Maken was defending the ordinance at the ordinance press conference and as soon as Rahul gave the statement, Maken said that what Rahul ji said was the party line
 ek mantri ne bhi kaha ki ’bos hameshaa sahi hota he’ to kya samajha jaae ki congress ke bos rahul gandhi hai
 Digvijay Singh: Rahul Gandhi is the Vice President of Congress
 is naate wo hamaari party main number-2 kii posishan par hai to isamen kisi ko kya aapatti he
 Manoranjan Bharti: So is Rahul Gandhi deciding everything now? digvijay singh : rahul gandhi bhi kai ahm faisale lete hai, lekin aakhri faisalaa sonia gandhi hi karatin hai
 Manoranjan Bharti: Assembly elections are going to be held in five states soon, are you guessing? digvijay singh : main kabhi bhi chunaav ke liye anumaan nahin lagaataa hum, hamaari koshish is baat kii hogi ki ham sarkaar banane main kaamyaab rahen
 Manoranjan Bharti: People are saying that the Congress campaign is going well in Madhya Pradesh, but that campaign is of hit and run type
 dilli se netaa jate hai or bhaashan dekar chale aate hai Digvijay Singh: It is not like that candidates and workers from every field are doing their work, our entire organization is mobilized
 manoranjan bharti : kya aap vidhansabha kaa chunaav nahin ladenge
 Digvijay Singh: Yes, i will not contest the assembly elections
 manoranjan bharti : kya jyotiraditya bhi chunaav nahin lard rahe hai
 Digvijay Singh: Maybe Jyotiraditya is not even contesting
 manoranjan bharti : madhya pradesh main mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar koun hoga? Digvijay Singh: Let us get the majority first, then it will be decided
 manoranjan bharti : kya aap loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladenge? Digvijay Singh: If i get a chance, i will contest the Lok Sabha elections
 manoranjan bharti : chhattisgarh main bhi chunaav hai, vahaan kya sthiti he, kaha ja rahaa he ki agar ajit jogi ko kaman de di jaae to seat nikal saktin hai
 Digvijay Singh: i have not been to Chhattisgarh for a long time, so i do not know about the political situation there, i only know that the accident in which so many of our senior leaders have settled, people have sympathy for them in the last 10 years
 Raman Singh has looted the people of Chhattisgarh a lot, due to this people are very angry
 manoranjan bharti : to phir paanch rajyon ke chunaavon par aap kya kahenge jeetenge yaa


 Digvijay Singh: We have always contested elections to win and will keep fighting
 is baar bhi achche se chunaav ladenge

 At the same time, Saqlain Mushtaq came to bowl for Pakistan, who had 3 wickets in the match

 The story of the film 'club 60' revolves around some characters 60 and older
 
 
 unheen kirdaaron main se ek hai doctor (farrukh shaikh), or ek din unki patni (sarika) or unke khushhaal jivan main achaanak gam kaa andhera chaa jaataa he, jab amarika main unke jawan bete kii maut ho jaati he
 
 
 After this news, the doctors attempt suicide and Sarika keeps trying to save them
 
 
 isi dauraan unki mulaakaat hoti he manu bhai (raghuveer yadav) se, jo doctor ko 'club 60' kaa sadsy banaate hai, or yahaan unki mulaakaat hoti he '60' ke gang se
 
 
 It has been told in the film that there is some difficulty in the life of every human being
 
 
 kisi ne apane bachche kii maut dekhi he, to kisi kaa betaa gharajanvai banakar sasuraal main hi bas gaya he
 
 
 Someone's son does not even go to the news of parents going abroad
 
 
 yani, dukh har insaan kii zindagi se jude hai
 
 
 In such a situation, how to be happy, how to be happy, this is shown in 'club 60'
 
 
 film main superstar koi nahin he, magar kalakaar bade hai, jinhone jabardast abhinay kiya he
 
 
 The film is not even big budget, but its story and thinking is quite big
 
 
 film main koi item song nahin he, magar jo bhi ek-do gane hai, kahani main behad acchhee tarah piroe gaye hai
 
 
 Even though there are no comedians in the film, the character of Gujarati Manu Bhai has entertained
 
 
 gamzada pati-patni ke kirdaaron main farrukh shaikh or sarika ne jaan daal di he
 
 
 Overall, director Sanjay Tripathi has beautifully portrayed not only the grief and pain of the elders, but also the ways of enjoying their lives, and their moments of laughter
 
 
 yah dekhnaa bhi acha anubhav rahaa ki kis tarah ye bujurg ek-duusare ke saath rahete hai, sukh main, or dukh main bhi
 
 
 How do girls flirt with girls? 
 
 kaash, film kii marketing kaa bajet bada hota or film zyada se zyada logon tak pahunch paati
 
 
 By the way, some scenes are long drawn
 
 
 khaastaur se clymex seen hazam nahin hota
 
 
 The film based on relationships has tried to convey a good message
 
 
 'club 60' yah sandesh bhi detii he ki apana ho yaa dusron kaa, dukh baantne se kam hota he or sukh baantne se badhata he
 
 
 So my rating for this film is 3
 5 star

 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne puri takat se saath chunaav prachaar kiya
 Rahul himself campaigned on four stages under the Gujarat Navsarjan Yatra
 rahul soobe ke 135 vidhansabha kshetron main sidhe taure par pahunche
 While he indirectly covered 42 assemblies
 chaay dukaanon se lekar rahul mandir-mandir ghoomte rahe, phir bhi wo 22 saal se satta par kabiz bijepi kii neenv nahin hilaa paae
 Actually, the major reason behind this is also being considered the weakness of the local leadership
 raajnneetik vishleshak ye bhi daawey kar rahe hai ki mahaj do-teen maheene kisi rajya main jaakar chunaav nahin ladane se nattejey anuroop nahin aa sakate
 In such a situation, the strengthening of the organization becomes a savior for the BJP, the same weak party organization seems to be the cause of defeat for the Congress
 yahaan tak ki jo bade sthaneey netaa congress ke paas the, unhen bhi congress saath rakhane main naakaam rahi
 Shankar Singh Vaghela is a name who has a major say in Gujarat's politics and is considered to have great influence there
 lekin party netritv se naaraazgi ke baad 21 july 2017 ko apane 77wein janmdin par is varisht netaa ne congress se rishta khatm karne kaa elaan kar diya
 If Khali Vaghela's Kameerahul Gandhi's entire election campaign is seen, then in-charge of Gujarat Ashok Gehlot was seen standing with him
 gahalot ke alaava gujarat congress ke adhyaksh bharat singh solanki, arjuna modhwadiya or shaktisingh gohil hi rahul ke saath saarvajanik manchon par najar aae
 These are the local leaders of the Congress in Gujarat, who themselves have fallen behind in electoral politics
 arjuna modhwadiya congress ke varishthatam netaaon main shumaar hai or wo porbandar seat se 2012 ke baad ek baar phir chunaav haar gaye hai
 On the other hand, if we talk about Shaktisinh Gohil, he too has lost the election this time
 2012 main wo abdasa seat se chunaav haare the, is baar party ne unhen mandavi seat se tikat diya, baavjood iske wo apni seat bachaane main kaamyaab nahin ho paae
 At the same time, Bharat Singh Solanki did not contest this time
 yani gujarat main congress ke jin bade netaaon ke saath rahul gandhi prachaar main ja rahe the, unka apana koi janaadhar nahin bachaa he
 In such a situation, the lack of a big Gujarati face like Shankar Singh Vaghela left the Congress
 darasal, waghela kii kami ek or vajah se bhi mahasoos kii gai
 Rahul Gandhi kept giving speeches in Hindi throughout the campaign, while PM Modi and BJP President Amit Shah addressed the people of Gujarat in the local language itself
 agar, waghela rahul ke saath manch saajha karte to sambhavat: wo gujarati main apni avam ko sambodhit kar pate or congress kii baat thik se rakh pate
 Which means the BJP had big Gujarati faces like Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 congress ke paas koi nahin tha
 Rahul may have gone there with full power, but his political career could not stand before modi-shah and proved to be dwarf
 yahi vajah he ki shankar singh waghela kaa factor bhi bijepi ke paksh main gaya he, aisa mana ja rahaa he
 However, he was with the Congress in the last election and the party got fewer seats than this time
 lekin maujuuda chunaav main patidaaron or obisi kaa samarthan milane se jaateey sameekaran congress ke paksh main dikhaai de rahe the or uski sthiti majboot dikh rahi thi
 It is also being said that even though Vaghela was not with the BJP, he left no stone unturned to harm the Congress
 yahaan tak ki ye baat saamne ai ki waghela ke ishaare par congress or rakanpa ke 11 vidhayakon ne raashtrapati chunaav main cross voting kii, jiske baad ek darjan congressi vidhayak shaq ke daayre main aa gaye
 Ultimately, he left the Congress and joined the BJP
 darasal, waghela is sambandh main congress netritv ko chetate bhi rahe
 The 77-year-old Vaghela, who played an active role in state politics for more than three decades, had said that if the Congress had already started preparing for the elections, it could have won
 party chhodane par waghela ne bhi safai di thi ki unhone rahul gandhi ko ye saaf kar diya tha ki unhen siem nahin bananaa he
 Vaghela had to give this clarification because he was facing allegations of demand for claiming the CM post
 haalanki, chunaav nateezon ne mukhyamantri ke naam par charchaa karne kaa mauka congress ko nahin diya he or rahul ek or chunavi pariksha main fail ho gaye hai

 Bollywood's famous actress Rekha Rekha started her career at 13 years

 In an interview, Rekha had told that i started my career due to poor family circumstances
 rekha ke pita superstar jaimini ganeshan the lekin unhen kabhi unka sahaara nahin mila
 Rekha was like a stranger to her father
 unhone ek chat sho main pita ke bare main kaha tha, "maine unhen dekha, lekin mahasoos nahin kiya
 When people say the word Father, i remember the Father of the Church first
 main ye bhi nahin kahuungi ki maine unhen bahut yaad kiya, kyonki jo rishta kabhi tha hi nahin uski kami kaise mahasoos hoti
 "once the most shocking thing was said by Rekha," i don't think my father ever saw me
 haa maine unhen dekha he, unki filmein dekhi hai, lekin real life main kabhi mahasoos nahin kiya
 "this was Rekha's real dream," Rekha said, "I never wanted to be an actress

 It was lucky that i reached here (cinema)

 company ke karmchaariyon ne ek khule patr main maalya par desh kii chhavi khaastaur par vimaanan udyog kii chhavi kharaab karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The wife of a then Kingfisher Airlines employee allegedly committed suicide on October 4, 2012 over financial stress arising out of non-payment of salaries to her husband
 karmchaariyon ne khule patr main kaha he, ‘‘ham aapaki udaseenta kii vajah se nirantar pidaa or tanaav main rahe hai
 However, we are deeply pained by the remark that you have 'no regrets' about Kingfisher Airlines
 hamaare liekingfisher airlineska astitv ab bhi he kyonki ham ab bhi bina vetan ke perol par hai, bhale hi hamen aapse company ke punaraddhaar ko lekar aashwaasan milane ke baad vetan ke sambandh main aapse kabhi koi soochna nahin mili

 '' itihaas kii do aisi ghatnaayen hai jo china main tibeti kutton ke prati moh ko darshaati hai
 It is the dreaded breed of dogs that is said so much in some parts of China, "this is the dog that should be kept tied up
" '' ek kahani bataati he ki jab mongolian shaasha changez khan tibeti pathaar ko paar karke europe main pravesh kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha to usne apane cmanderon ko aise 30,000 kutton kii ek fouj taiyaar karne ko kaha tha
 These Tibetan dogs were so famous that when the tourist Marco Polo arrived here, he expressed surprise at 'these dogs roaring like a lion'
 duusari ghatana haal kii he par yah bhi vaise hi ek ladaake commander kii he jiskaa najariya is shandaar jaanavar ko lekar kuch doosraa tha
 When Mao Tse Tung instructed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to cross the ice-frozen Yalu River to join the Korean War, he prepared cheap winter coats for the PLA, which was undergoing turbulence
 Was approved to kill tens of thousands of Tibetan dogs
 kaha jaataa he ki maao ne ek jatke main china ke kai hisson main sadiyon se behad sammaan kii najar se dekhe jane vaale in kutton ko maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 As popular as Mao is as the founding father of the country, Guo Mig is equally as angry at these dogs today
 in tibeti kutton ko koi saamaanya kutta na maanane vaale 57 varshiya mig kehete hai, ''maao ne yah behad galat kaam kiya tha
 "they say," calling them a dog is the same as calling a tiger a cat
 '' yah purv adhikari do dashakon se china main in vishalkay kutton ke sabase ahm prajnakon main se ek he
 Keeping pets in China was considered taboo for decades
 lekin jab china ke badhate madhya varg ne is pravriti ko posna shuru kiya to beijing ke upnagareey ilaakon main ubhar kar aae darjanabhar farm main se ek mig kaa bhi tha
 Otherwise, keeping pets was considered unimaginable and out of power in the 1960s and 1970s, and was then dismissed as a bourgeois hobby in Mao's China
 phir jab 1990 ke dashak main china main sudhaaron kaa daur shuru hua to sampann gharon main paaltu jaanavar najar aane shuru ho gaye
 But in cities, the government did not allow big dogs to be kept
 aaj bhi har shahar main koi kutta rakhane ke liye permit kii jarurat he or ek salanaa fees deni hoti he jo kute ke aakaar par nirbhar karti he
 That is why dogs like Pug, Pekingsey and Shih Jus are generally preferred
 lekin sampann tabaka kuch alag chahta tha isliye uskaa dhyaan lambey samay se bhulaae ja chuke tibet ke vishaal jhabareele kutton kii taraf gaya
 The crazy diocese Wang Shiapeng received his first Tibetan dog in 2003 as a gift from a friend who went to visit Tibet
 ve kehete hai, ''vah un tamaam kutton se behad alag tha, jo ab tak maine dekhe the
 "wang refers to a popular Chinese and Tibetan proverb," a Tibetan dog equals nine normal dogs
 '' wang jaise sampann chiniyon ke liye tibeti kutta haisiyat kaa pratik ban gaya
 As the price of these dogs increased, their farms also spread
 guao kehete hai, ''2003 main beijing main 100 se bhi kam dog farm the
 Today there are about 500 dog farms in the Zhaoquanying area of beijing's Shunyi District
 '' wang kehete hai, ''tibeti kute kaa hona sone kaa anda hone jaisaa hota tha
 i know of a breeder who had a male Tibetan dog of pure breed
 vah prajnan ke liye use duusare maalikon ko uplabdh karaane ke liye kareeb ek lakh yuan (das lakh ru
 ) Used to take
 aisa vah saal main 50 se 60 baar karata tha
 On seeing this he became a millionaire
 '' khud wang ne aage jaakar kutta ghar kholaa jisamen unhone kareeb 70 vishaal tibeti kute paale
 The new class of owners of these dogs also had an officer of the pla's Second Artillery Corps — a secret unit that controls missiles and nuclear weapons
 us afasar kii pahchaan sirf jhang naam ke rup main thi
 He got his first dog as a gift
 us samay prabhaavshaalee adhikariyon ko tohfe ke rup main yah kutta dena phayda uthaane kaa aam tarika ban gaya tha
 It was considered less risky than offering an apartment or cash as a bribe
 pichley saal in kutton ko lekar aturata charam par pahunch chuki thi
 At the Dog Fair in Zhejiang, a thriving coastal province in the south of China, a real estate practitioner paid around 140 lakh yuan (about Rs 14 crore) for two twin Tibetan dogs of a fully fledged breed
 ) adaa kiye
 Guao says, "I thought this boom would last at least 20 years, but it was barely five years
" '' ve ghatnakram ke itani teji se badalane se ab bhi hairaan hai
 In late 2014, the government launched an anti-corruption campaign targeting suspected officials
 usamen tibeti kutton kaa hona jaanch adhikariyon ke liye andeh ke subut ke taur par dekha jane laga tha
 Other breeders said that the slowdown in the Chinese economy also fueled this enthusiasm
 guao ke paas iskaa ek anya spashtikaran bhi he
 They consider it the equivalent of the stock market collapse in June, after which indiscriminately and irresponsibly began to buy stocks, "the reason people bought and sold Tibetan dogs like crazy people for five years
 was not
 '' prajnakon ne tibeti kutton kaa prajnan duniya ke har nasl ke kutton ke saath karana shuru kar diya jisase kharidaaron ko 'anuthe' kism ke, ajeebogareeb shaareerik prakruti ke tibeti kute milane lage
 Some had different hairs and some had jaws hanging
 khalis nasl ke tibeti kutton ke shaukeenon ke liye to yah bhayaavah tha
 In a distorted market, the most funny and peculiar-looking Tibetan dogs started getting the highest price
 dharashayitibbati kutton kaa yah vyavsaay kaabo se itnaa baahar ho gaya ki guao ke anusaar aaj khalis nasl ke tibeti kute beijing main in kutton kii kul aabaadi kaa mahaj ek fisadi rah gaye honge
 Today, Tibetan dogs of pure breed have no value
 jo pille kabhi 50,000 yuan (paanch lakh ru
 ), They now cost 1,500 yuan (15,000 rupees)
 ) main mil ja rahe hai
 The breeders are out of business
 tibeti kutton kii yah badalati niyati kuch maheenon pehle us vakt logon ke dhyaan main ai jab pashu rakshakon ke ek dal ne 100 se zyada kutton ko bujadkaane le ja rahe ek trek ko roka
 There were 20 Tibetan dogs among them

 kuch maah pehle kii hi baat he jab beijing se yahaan aane vaala rajmarg trephic se jam ho jaataa tha kyonki sampann chini sapariwaar yahaan aate the or tibeti kutton ke pillon par hajaaron kharch karte the
 Today there are thousands of dogs who cannot find a home
 ab in farmahouson main aane vaale trakon kii niyat kuch or hoti he
 They are equipped with weighing machines and cages
 ve prajnakon ko prati pille ke hisaab se nahin balki prati ounce vajan ke hisaab se dhan dete hai—us gosht ke liye jo bujadkaane main bechaa jayega
 These fighters in Guao Tibet tell the story of the rise and fall of dogs as a tragedy, reflecting a society where status and wealth are the highest
 vahaan nai sanak ko utani hi teji se dimag se utaar diya jaataa he jitani teji se vah savaar hoti he
 Tibetan dogs are Chinese property
 unhen bachaae rakhane kii bajaae ham maance ke liye unhen maar daal rahe hai
 "guao does not know where this story of the rediscovery and fall of Tibetan dogs will be completed, but they anticipate an extremely bad situation

 In this role, the senior poet of our time Manglesh Dabral writes: "in the world of poetry there have always been less creators who have changed the poetry and also changed the history of poetry
 '' yah is bhoomika kaa pehla vaakya he
 History of Hindi poetry is not a small history

 As time and society turned, poets recorded it in their poetry

 His poems became prosely in his expression of resentment

 The excerpt from this long poem, considered a modern version of the time of Mahabharata, tells us that we are living in a time / where vultures enter houses and we cannot even scream

 There is a statement by Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, "both prose and verse can contain poetry

 The crisis of fake currency has once again hit the country
 lihaaja agar aap cash main sauda karte hai yaa phir len-dein to saavdhaan ho jaaie
 The danger has increased even that banks have started pasting notices of special series of notes in their branches
 agar aapke paas bhi badi sankhya main nakadi he, to is siries ke numberon ke saath use jarur jaanch lijie
 The Reserve Bank of India has told that in the last one year, the number of fake notes caught during 2015-16 has increased by more than 20 times
 desh main nakli noton kaa bijness desh ke andar or seemapar, donon taraf se teji se fal-phool rahaa he or bhartiya arthvyavastha ko har saljaali notonki vajah se arabon rupye kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 So far, 95 percent of the total counterfeit notes have been caught by commercial banks, while the remaining 5 percent by the Reserve Bank of India
 100 or 1000 ke note sabase zyada naklikhri karency main sauda karne se pehle is baat ko acchhee tarah jaan lijie ki market main sabase zyada 100 or 1000 rupee ke note nakli hai
 One of the motives behind issuing notices of special series notes is that the Reserve Bank will issue new series notes to deal with this problem of counterfeit notes
 nae noton kii is siries main suraksha ke tareeke bhi nae honge
 To avoid the problem of counterfeit notes, central banks around the world usually take out new series of notes, which are equipped with new security standards

 Identify fake notes like this: * The real bank note has a watermark on it
 yah watermark aap gandhi ji kii photo ke andar dekh sakate hai
 * In a 1000 and 500 rupee note, the value of the currency is written between the currency with special ink, which can be seen by cropping the note
 *ultrawilet roshni kii madad se note ke neeche kii taraf likhi gai siries ko dekhen, to vah ubhara hua dikhaai detaa he, laal rang chamakdaar hokar dikhataa he
 * There is a security thread from top to bottom of the note, in which the amount of the currency and RBI is written
 asli note main yah saaf or motaa hota he, jabaki nakli kii printing behad marial hoti he
 * 5, 10, 20 rupees in a real note, next to Gandhiji's photo, almost has RBI written in small letters near his ear
 jabaki isse upar ke noton main note kii vailu likhi hoti he
