 (IANS) Analysts do not consider internationalization of citizenship issue as justified
 Governor asks Mamata Banerjee to withdraw demand for referendum
 What is referendum? Mamta Banerjee's demand for Referendum on the new Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Citizenship Register (NRC) has brought it into the discussion
 in donon maamalon par deshbhar main virodh-pradarshan ho rahe hai
 Hundreds of protesters were detained in large numbers on Thursday for violating prohibitory orders imposed around the Red Fort area in Delhi, following which a large number of protesters were detained
 vahiin pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne bhi kolkata main talkh tevar dikhaae
 Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee had said on Thursday that if the BJP had the courage, it should hold a referendum on the CAA and NRC under United Nations (UN) oversight
 mamata banerjeene kaha ki janamat sangrah ke baad dekhte hai ki koun jeetta he
 Challenging the Modi government at the Center, Mamta further said that if you lose, you will have to resign
 is bich, bengal ke rajyapal jagadeep dhankhad ne mukhyamantri mamata banerjee se naagarikta sanshodhan adhinium or enarasi par sanyukt raashtra se janamat sangrah karaane vaale bayaan ko waapas lene kaa aagrah kiya he
 Governor Dhankhar tweeted that as a citizen of the country, he is deeply saddened and hurt by Banerjee's statement
 unhone kaha ki wo ummid karte hai ki mukhyamantri unke anurodh par nishchit rup se dhyaan dengi kyonki rashtrawaad se kisi ko bhi samjhauta nahin karnaa chahie
 In the name of our Founding Fathers i fervently appeal to her to act as per her oath and regretfully withdraw her statement
 As a senior leader and constitutional functionary she cannot be oblivious to the potentially dangerous consequences of such approach
 - Jagdeep Dhankhar (@ jdhankhar1) December 20, 2019 Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar wrote in his tweet, i appeal to CM Mamata Banerjee to please withdraw his statement
 sanyukt raashtra yaa rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog nishpaksh sanghathan he or mamata banerjee ko chahie ki ve yah kahen ki kitne log iske paksh main hai or kitne vipaksh main hai yah janamat ho
 We should never compromise our nationalism
 raashtra sarvopari he or hamen yakeen he ki siem mamata banerjee mere vinamr anurodh par dhyaan dengi or apane bayaan ko waapas lengi
 How appropriate is Mamta's demand for a referendum, however, a referendum means a referendum
 matlab logon kii raay lenaa
 Recently it was seen that England had consulted people to break away from the European Union
 log apni sahmati yaa asahmati vyakt karke raay vyakt karte hai
 Mamta Banerjee is also demanding such opinion on the issue of citizenship
 sawaal he ki mamata banerjee kaa naagarikta ke mudde par bharat main janamat sangrah karaaye jane kii maang karnaa kitna uchit he
 Shrish Pathak, a political analyst and assistant professor at Amity University, Noida, does not agree with Mamata Banerjee's demand on the matter
 shrish pathak kehete hai, 'mamata banerjee utsaah main asaadhaaran baat kah rahi hai
 His statement is against collusion
 yah hamaara andruni maamla he
 He should never say such a thing as a Chief Minister
 'is sawaal par ki kya sanyukt raashtra kii nigaraanee main refrendom ho saktaa he? shrish pathak kehete hai ki yah mumkin ho saktaa he, lekin sawaal he ki ham is mudde ko vahaan le hi kyon jaaenge
 We should not internationalize this issue, rather Mamata Banerjee should demand that a meeting of all states be convened immediately on this issue
 shrish pathak kehete hai ki yah ek jaij maang is maukey par isliye bhi nahin he kyonki janata main abhi ise lekar kisi prakaar kii jaagrukta nahin he

 uttarakhand ko devbhumi bhi kaha jaataa he
 There is a lot of temples here in every street
 hindu dharm ke anusaar 33 karod devi-devtaa hai, lekin uttarakhand main yah sankhya isse bhi kahin zyada ho jaati he, kyonki yahaan bhumiyaan devtaa se lekar gwel devtaa, gram devtaa or kul devataaon kii bhi manyata he
 This is the land where Duryodhana and Danveer Karna, the 'villains' of Mahabharata, are also worshiped
 ji haa, uttarakhand ke uttarkashi jile main duryodhana or karn ke mandir hai
 The temple of Duryodhana is in a solar village located on the 'har Ki Doon' road, about 12 km from a place called Netwar
 dehradun se kareeb 95 kimi dur chakraata or chakraata se kareeb 69 kimi dur netwar gaanv he
 While the Karna temple is in Sarnaul village, about one and a half miles from Netwar
 sarnaul or saura gaanv kii yah bhoomi bhubruvahan naam ke ek mahaan yoddha kii dharti he
 It is believed that Bhubruvahana, the king of Patalaloka, wanted to be part of the Mahabharata war between the Kauravas and the Pandavas in Dwaparyuga
 man main yahi chahat liye vah dharti par aayaa, lekin bhagwaan krishna ne badi hi chaalaaki se use yuddh se dur kar diya
 Bhubruvahana wanted to join the war on behalf of the Kauravas and Krishna feared that Bhubruvahana might challenge Arjuna
 isliye unhone bhubruvahan ko ek chunauti di
 Krishna challenged Bhubruvahana to pierce all the leaves of a tree with a single arrow, meanwhile Krishna broke a leaf and pressed it under his foot
 bhubruvahan kaa tir ped par maujuud sabhi patton ko chhedne ke baad krishna ke pair kii taraf bad rahaa tha, tabhi unhone apana pair hataa liya
 Krishna somehow wanted to keep Bhubruvahana away from the war and he asked him to be impartial
 nishpaksh rahane kaa arth yuddh se dur rahanaa tha or mahabharat ke yuddh se dur rahanaa kisi bhi yoddha ko manjuur nahin hota, isliye krishna ne bhubruvahan se paar paane kaa rasta nikaal liya
 He somehow severed Bhubruvahana's head from his torso
 uttarakhand sarkaar kii website se liya gaya karn ke mandir kaa skichahalanki krishna ne yuddh shuru hone se pehle hi bhubruvahan kaa sir dhad se alag kar diya, lekin usne yuddh dekhne kii ichha jaahir kii or bhagwaan krishna ne uski ichha puri kii
 He hung Bhubruvahana's head on a tree here and he saw the entire battle of Mahabharata from here
 sthaneey logon kaa kahana he ki jab-jab bhi mahabharat ke yuddh main kauravon kii ranneeti vifal hoti, jab-jab bhi unhen haar kaa munh dekhnaa padataa, tab bhubruvahan jor-jor se chillaakar unase ranneeti badalane ke liye kahata tha
 He used to cry and is still crying today
 manyata to ye bhi he ki bhubruvahan ke inhen aansuon se yahaan tamas yaa tones naam kii nadi bani he
 That is why no one drinks the water of this river even today
 duryodhana or karn donon bhubruvahan ke bade prashansak the
 The locals here still salute his valor and songs are sung in his praise
 yahaan ke logon ne bhubruvahan ke mitra karn or duryodhana ke mandir banaae hai
 Duryodhana's temple is in Saura village, while Karna's temple is in Sarnaul village
 yahi nahin ye donon is ilaake ke kshetrapal bhi ban gaye

 India are on the driving seat after the second day of the third Test (match report) being played against Australia in Melbourne
 bharat ne apni pehali pari main 7 wicket par 443 ran banaakar ghoshit kar di
 And also made the Australian openers quite uncomfortable
 lekin purv kangaroo captain riki ponting ne bahut hi ajibo-garib baat kahi he
 Ponting has said that India may lose the Melbourne Test
 jahaan, puraa cricket jagat cheteshwar pujaara kii kii pari kii saraahna kar rahaa he, to vahiin purv captain ne kaha ki bharat pujaara kii pari ke kaaran hi haar saktaa he
 Cheteshwar Pujara's 106 and fifties from Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma power India to 443 / 7d on Day 2 of the third Test
 Can they press their advantage tomorrow? # ausvind REPORT https: / / t
 co / zrrapb0ytqpic
 twitter
 com / el6jc1tdji In India's first innings where skipper Virat Kohli smashed 82 off 204 balls, Pujara scored 106 off 319 balls with 10 fours
 pujaara sau overon ke dauraan pich par tike rahe
 In the last, Pat Cummins ended Pujara's innings
 bahut hi nichi rahati gend par pujaara bold ho gaye
 And after some time Ajinkya Rahane too did the same on a low ball
 or in donon kaa out hona saaf taur par ishaara de gaya ki agle kuch dinon main pich kaisaa bartaav karne ja rahaa hi 
 Pujara, along with captain Virat Kohli, put Australia on the backfoot in a 170-run partnership
 lekin ponting ne pujaara ke andaaj kii aalochana kii he
 Ponting did not hesitate to say that Pujara's innings could also cause India to lose the match
 ponting ne kaha ki apni ballebaaji ke dauraan pujaara ne ran batorne ke prati chintaa nahin dikhaai
 Ponting said that if India wins the match from here, then Pujara's innings will be included in the great innings
 ponting ne aage kaha ki lekin agar bharat ko australia ko do baar ol out karne ke liye paryaapt samay nahin mila, to phir match ko ganvaane kii vajah bhi pujaara kii pari hi hogi
 He said that Pujara has scored two centuries
 or vah out hote nahin dikhte, lekin is dauraan unka ravaiya aisa ho chalata he, jahaan ran na nikalnaa unhen bilkul bhi hatotsahit nahin karata
 The former captain said that India have batsmen with good strokes, but if they do not play fast, the average is going to be around two runs per over
 or yah test cricket ke liye acha nahin he
 i think it has always been difficult to find a good average for India when Pujara is on the pitch
 bhartiya team ke captain viraat kohli or purv mukhya coach anil kumble bich hue vivaadon ke mudde par bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ke purv 'bos' anuraag thakur bilkul spasht raay rakhte hai
 Anurag believes that the team belongs to the captain and that is why he should be the 'boss' in the true sense
 supreme court ke adeshon kaa paalan karte hue aaj anuraag himachal pradesh cricket sangh (echpisie) ke adhyaksh pad tak hi simit ho gaye hai lekin captain or coach ke bich hue vivaadon ko lekar himachal pradesh olympic sangh ke maujuuda adhyaksh or bijepi saansad anuraag kii raay bilkul spasht he
 Anurag Thakur's statement here is shocking because Anil Kumble was appointed the coach of Team India when Anurag Thakur was the chairman of BCCI
 saath hi supreme court ke aadesh ke baad anuraag thakur ne hi coach chayan ke liye sachin tendulkar, saurav ganguli or vivies lakshmana ko milakar teen sadasyi cameti banaai thi
 The same committee had approved the name of Anil Kumble
 yahaan jari himachal pradesh olympic khelon kii dekharekh kar rahe anuraag ne kaha ki kumble or viraat ke bich hue vivaad main viraat par zyada dabaav banaaya gaya
 He said, why is pressure being made on Virat without talking? It is not right to target Virat with all these things because it has not happened for the first time
 pehle greg chapel ko bhi hataaya gaya
 It has happened all the time that the captain is more important, even in the selection committee because ultimately the team has to feed the captain
 bharat main bhi aaj tak kaa itihaas dekhie aapke paas viraat se bada khilaadi nahin he
 For the next 10 years, if you want to take the country's cricket to this level or beyond, then you need a messenger like Virat
 ullekhneey he ki haal hi main kumble ne viraat ke saath matbhedon kii baat ko sweekaar karte hue bhartiya team ke mukhya coach pad se istipha de diya tha
 His contract was for the Champions Trophy but the BCCI extended it to the West Indies tour but he returned home straight from England
 iske baad kai purv khilaadiyon ne kaha tha ki viraat bhartiya cricket main bos ban gaye hai, jo nahin hona chahie
 When Anurag was the president of BCCI, Kumble was appointed to the post of coach
 anuraag ne kaha, "jab tak main bisisiai kaa adhyaksh rahaa tab tak koi vivaad nahin hua
 We made the appointment clean and transparent
 aaj jo log baithe hai, unase sawaal karne chahie kii aisi chijen baahar aati kyon hai
 My opinion in this matter is quite clear
 viraat ko bos hona chahie
 Virat is the boss
 (viraat shud bi da bos, viraat must bi da bos, and viraat ij da bos)
 He is the captain of the team and that is why he should be the boss
 "tippaniyan Regarding the coach position, Thakur said, "the coach has a place of his own, but 11 players of the team have to feed the captain on the field, so priority should be given to the same things and needs
 " Input: IANS yahaan jari himachal pradesh olympic khelon kii dekharekh kar rahe anuraag ne kaha ki kumble or viraat ke bich hue vivaad main viraat par zyada dabaav banaaya gaya
 He said, why is pressure being made on Virat without talking? It is not right to target Virat with all these things because it has not happened for the first time
 pehle greg chapel ko bhi hataaya gaya
 It has happened all the time that the captain is more important, even in the selection committee because ultimately the team has to feed the captain
 bharat main bhi aaj tak kaa itihaas dekhie aapke paas viraat se bada khilaadi nahin he
 For the next 10 years, if you want to take the country's cricket to this level or beyond, then you need a messenger like Virat
 ullekhneey he ki haal hi main kumble ne viraat ke saath matbhedon kii baat ko sweekaar karte hue bhartiya team ke mukhya coach pad se istipha de diya tha

 The first Greg Chappell was also removed
 yah har samay hi hua he ki captain hi zyada ahm he, chayansmiti main bhi kyonki aakhirkaar team captain ko hi khilaani he
 See the history till date in India, you do not have a player bigger than Virat
 agle 10 saal aapako desh kii cricket isi str par yaa isse aage le jaani he to aapako viraat jaisaa doot chahie
 It is noteworthy that recently Kumble resigned as the head coach of the Indian team after admitting to the differences with Virat
 unka qaraar champiens trophy tak ke liye hi tha lekin bisisiai ne ise westeindies daure tak ke liye badha diya tha lekin vah england se sidhe swadesh laut aae
 After this, many former players had said that Virat has become the boss in Indian cricket, which should not happen

 pakistan ke khilaaf ravivaar ko hone vaale maha mukaable se pehle bhartiya spinner harbhajan singh ne pakistan ko jeet kaa mantra diya
 However, fulfilling the conditions he laid down would not be difficult for the Pakistan team
 darasal, ek video chat main shoeb akhtar ne harbhajan singh se poocha ki pakistan aisa kya kare ki wo bharat par jeet hasil kar le
 In response to this, Harbhajan laughed and said, 'bring Younis Khan in Pakistan's team, bring inzamam-ul-haq and bring Saeed Anwar too, then something better can go
 'bataa den ki ye teenon pakistani khilaadi sanyas le chuke hai
 In such a situation, the 'guru Mantra' of Harbhajan Singh cannot work in Pakistan
 bhajji ne pakistani team kii kamajori par baat karte hue kaha ki maujuuda team pressure nahin jhel paati
 Players are out by hitting absurd shots
 haalanki, unhone babar ajam kii tarif bhi kii or kaha ki wo acha khilaadi he, imam bhi acha khilaadi he
 At the same time, Harbhajan said that the mistakes of Younis Khan and Inzamam were not done, the batsmen of the Pakistani team will have to learn the same batting
 harbhajan ne kaha ki pakistani team main tallent kii koi kami nahin he
 But these wrong shots are played
 unhone kaha ki team india ke captain viraat kohli or rohit sharma isliye behatar hai kyonki wo betuke shot nahin khelte
 They know where to hit if they want to hit the fours and which ball to hit
 harbhajan singh ne kaha ki pakistan kii team agar lanbaa khelti he to kuch behatar ho saktaa he
 He also said that if Pakistan wins the toss, then it should bat first
 kyonki aise main team par pressure nahin hoga
 Pakistan should carry a target of 270
 yahi team india kaa bhi formula he

 After the decision of the Delhi High Court, the kind of language and attitude of the government had shown that the fight may have ended now, but this battle has started in a new form, which was already being expressed
 tippaniyan It is the case of Chinese mange that led to the loss of four lives in Delhi
 iske baad mangalvaar ko dilli sarkaar ne notification jari karke chini maanjhe par pratibandh laga diya
 But late Tuesday evening, Deputy CM Manish Sisodia demanded from LG Najeeb Jung that action should be taken against the environment secretary due to negligence and insensitivity in work
 adhisuchana jari karne main saat din kii deree kii gai jabaki 9 agast ke din hi file maine or mantri imran hossain ne clear kar di thi' In fact, now the officers in Delhi government do not listen to the ministers but directly to the LG because after the High Court order, all the officers and employees of the government work directly under the LG
 isliye dipti siem asal main ek aalaa afasar ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang karke bataanaa chaah rahe hai ki alji ke shashan main afasar kaise laaparvaah hai

 In view of the Lok Sabha elections, it has been decided that there will no longer be any alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress in Delhi
 mangalvaar ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath dilli congress ke netaaon kii ek ghanta chali baithak ke baad dilli congress adhyaksh shila dikshit ne saaf kah diya ki aam aadmi party se koi gathbandhan nahin hoga or rahul gandhi ne bhi isko sweekaar kar liya he
 The Aam Aadmi Party was eager for an alliance
 khud aam aadmi party ke mukhiya or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne saarvajanik rup se yahaan tak kah diya tha ki ham congress ko manaa manaa kar thak gaye hai lekin congress gathbandhan ke liye nahin maan rahi
 Whereas the Congress also believes that in Delhi it cannot defeat the BJP alone and the Aam Aadmi Party will split votes by fighting separately for the Congress, which will directly benefit the BJP
 iske baavjood agar congress ne gathbandhan ke liye manaa kar diya he to iske paanch sambhavit kaaran maane ja rahe hai
 The leaders of Delhi Congress believe that when the Congress formed an alliance with regional parties in a state, then the party went down further and the condition was that where the Congress party ruled unanimously, the party would become only a hanger party
 She left
 jaise ki uttar pradesh or bihar
 Therefore, the leaders of the Delhi Congress were against the alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party from the beginning
 aam aadmi party congress se gathbandhan ko betaab isliye bhi he kyonki loksabhaa chunaav pradhanmantri banane ke liye he
 Therefore, the Aam Aadmi Party is feeling that the public may not go in its favor this time because in any case the Prime Minister cannot be of the Aam Aadmi Party
 isliye vah congress se gathbandhan karnaa chaahati he kyonki dilli ke hisaab se pradhanmantri yaa to bijepi se banenge yaa congress se
 In such a situation, the Aam Aadmi Party wants to maintain itself in the national context for this Lok Sabha election with the help of Congress
 jabaki aam aadmi party maanati he ki jab dilli main vidhansabha chunaav honge to uske paas arvind kejariwal jaisaa siem ummidavaar hoga jiske 5 saal ke kaam or naam par janata use dobaaraa chune kii isliye vidhansabha chunaav main aam aadmi party ko congress kii jarurat utani nahin hogi jitani loksabhaa chunaav main he
 But if the Aam Aadmi Party is not able to do well in the Lok Sabha elections, then there will be a perception about it that the Aam Aadmi Party is coming out of the minds of the people of Delhi and it may have to bear the brunt of it in the assembly elections
 yah baat congress samajhati he isliye usne gathbandhan ke liye saaf inkaar kar diya

 It seems that the Kejriwal faction of the party is now going on a strategy of keeping the yogendra-prashant faction openly in the face of being quiet for a few days, so one after another the leaders are coming out in the media but personally because the party's official Has not surfaced yet
 bacchon ko najar jaldi lag jaati he
 This makes children always sick
 aise main mata-pita ko bahut pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 If you want to keep your child away from evil eyes, then follow these steps
 
 
 1
 The child should be served with his own hand
 aapke haath se parosa gaya khaanaa uske sharir main usee tarah se lagegaa jis prakaar se bachapan main maa kaa doodh lagata he
 2
 raat ko sote samay bachche ke sir ke daayin taraf pani kaa ek lotaa yaa gilaas rakhen
 This will prevent Kuvichar from having any effect on his mind while sleeping at night
 jaane, kin pedo kii puja se milegi naukari main pramotion
 
 
 3
 bachche ke jagane par uske paas jarur upasthit rahen
 If the child sees you when you wake up, then he will keep your picture in his mind throughout the day
 jab bhagwaan shiv ne tod die pushan dev ke daant
 
 
 4
 bacchon ko gharavaalon kii najar bhi lag jaati he
 Therefore, when the child goes to bed in the evening, a stone should be turned around the child and washed with water and kept in a fixed place
 jis din khatarnaak najar lagi hogi yaa koi beemaari pareshaan karne vaali hogi, to vah pathar apane sthaan par nahi milegaa yaa tutaa milegaa
 Children have been learning in the classroom for centuries, but technology has completely changed the classroom
 aadhunik takanic ke chalate aaj hamaara padhane kaa tarika puri tarah se badal gaya he
 Today, smartboards, tablets and e-books have replaced the traditional black board
 yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki puraane jamaane ke classroom aaj puri tarah se badal chuke hai
 In view of this change, it is important that we continue to use modern technologies in the classroom
 nai techno logy jaise virtual rielti, ogmented rielti or mixd rielity ke chalate classroom larnig ke liye interactive spes ban gaya he
 There are several reasons why immersive learning techniques are used in the classroom
 virtual rielti chaatro ke seekhney kii tareeke main badlaav laa sakati he
 There are more reasons for missed periods, not just pregnancy, but imagine an environment where students are understanding the potential of kinetic and kinetic energy in the classroom, for which the example of a roller coaster ride is taken, in such cases the Taj Mahal The example of virtual education field timp can also be taken
 imarsive technology ko classroom main shaamil karne se larnig na keval rochak ban jaati he, balki chaatr mushkil avadharanaon ko bhi aasaani se samaj pate hai
 Virtual Reality removes all barriers to learning and offers students the opportunity for practical learning, which is actually the best way to learn outside the realm of classroom space
 vahiin duusari ore, virtual rielti ke dwaara chaatr chizon kii kalpana usee tarah karte hai, jaisi ummid unke adhyapakon ko hoti he
 This way promotes creativity in students
 ve vaastavik paristhitiyon kii kalpana kar use seekhney kii koshish karte hai
 Technology is still changing today
 aise main classroom main imarsive takanic ko lagu karne se pehle kai jaruri chizon par dhyaan dena jaruri he
 Virtual Reality is connecting students to the outside world
 aise main is baat par dhyaan dena jaruri he ki chaatr imarsive vaataavaran main kya sikh rahe hai
 Do not want any problem in pregnancy, do not eat these things
 To provide excellent experience to the students, quality virtual reality content should be created
 acha contint bananaa hi paryaapt nahin he, ise kaksha main lagu karnaa bhi ek bad chunauti hoti he
 Portable VR Labs incorporates VR technology into the classroom in a very interesting way, which on the one hand reduces the cost of infrastructure and resources in the school, on the other hand it makes it very practical for students to learn the concept
 kuch samay pehle tak hedset kii keemat or dizin ek badi chunauti thi jo skulon main viaar ko apnaane ke aade aa rahi thi
 But now this cost has come down so much that it can be used easily
 saath hi, yah ummid karnaa avyaavhaarik hoga ki chaatr baari, bade aakaar ke viaar hedset pahanakar pisi ke saath conect hon tathaa apane viaar adhyyon kaa anand uthaa saken
 We need an all-in-one mobile VR headset that can solve the above problem and make the learning interactive using a practical handheld controller
 iske alaava, chaatro, shikshakon, skulon, abhibhavakon evam anya sabhi hitdharakon main virtual rielti ke bare main jaagrukta paidaa karnaa bhi jaruri he
 They should know how virtual reality can change the way students learn in the classroom
 saath hi isse judi galat avadharanaon ko dur karnaa bhi jaruri he, jaise technology adhyaaapak kii jagah le sakati he, jo ki puri tarah se galat he
 Virtual Reality is a supplementary tool that enhances the quality of learning and teaching
 wo din dur nahin jab teacher or skool donon kii avadharana badal sakati he
 (the author is Senior Education Consultant of 'vital Labs') dilli ke hoicourt main desh ke vittamantri arun jetali dwaara daayar manahani kaa ek cese charchit cese chal rahaa he
 The case has been filed by Arun Jaitley against Aam Aadmi Party convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and four other party leaders
 arvind kejariwal ne arun jetali par didisie main pad par rahane ke dauraan bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaae or lagaataar kai manchon se kai sau karod ke ghotaale ke aarope lagaate rahe
 Arun Jaitley first warned him to file a defamation case without any evidence
 is chetavanee ko arvind kejariwal and team ne ek dhamkee ke taur par liya or chunauti pesh kii ki vah court jaaen vahaan par apane aap cese se jude aaropon kii sachai saamne aa jaaegi
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the Narendra Modi government at the Center has accepted this challenge and has filed a defamation suit in the court
 ab is maamle main pichley kai maheenon se sunwaayee jari he
 On behalf of Arvind Kejriwal, the country's famous lawyer Ram Jethmalani is appearing in the case
 puure maamle main mana ja rahaa he ki ram jethmalani or arun jetali main tikhi bahes hui
 The case also came out in one case that the Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi had paid a bill of crores for the most expensive lawyer of the country, Ram Jethmalani, who was talking about fighting this case for free
 lekin maamla rajyapal ke paas jaakar atak gaya
 Now Arvind Kejriwal as the Chief Minister of Delhi is talking about fighting in this case
 khayr maamla jo bhi ho, guuruuvaar kii court kii sunwaayee main us samay ek nayaa mode aa gaya jab arun jetali kii ore se bahes kar rahe rajeev nair or sanjeev sethi ne ek aisa prashn puch liya jisase arvind kejariwal kii mushkilen or bad sakati hai
 The matter may also be such that Arvind Kejriwal, who is already fighting a case of defamation of 10 crores, may not have to fight another 10 crores case
 kal kii sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne arvind kejariwal ke vakil ram jethmalani kii court main arun jetali par kii gai kai tippaniyon ko nindaatmak qaraar diya
 The court said that if Arvind Kejriwal has been asked to use this type of language, then there is no use to take the debate further in this matter
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki kal kii sunwaayee raghav chaddha kii ek apil par hui thi jisamen arun jetali ke vakeelon ne yah maamla uthaaya
 Judge Manmohan said that in such a situation, Kejriwal should first come and give a statement on his allegations
 yah puraa maamla tab prakaash main jab arun jetali kii ore se bahes ke liye aae vakeelon ne court se kaha ki pehle yah saaf ho janaa chahie ki jis bhashaa kaa prayog ram jethmalani kar rahe hai kya vah arvind kejariwal kii sahmati se ho rahaa he
 He also said that Ram Jethmalani has said that what he is saying he is saying on behalf of Arvind Kejriwal
 jetali ke vakeelon ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal ne agar aisi bhashaa kaa prayog karne kii ijaajat arun jetali ke khilaaf di he to phir ek or 10 karod kaa manahani kaa cese daayar kiya jayega
 After this, Judge Manmohan lashed out and said that when defamation case is already going on, no one can be insulted by using language in this way
 court main jaj ne kaha ki agar aisa hi kisi rape ke cese main hua hota to yah peedit ke pratadna ke baraabar hota
 After this, the court said that the lawyer of the victim can also do a second case in this case
 bataa den ki court ke sanyukt register ke saamne arun jetali kaa cross-ikjamination karte hue ram jethmalani ne crook (dhokheybaaj) shabd kaa prayog kiya tha
 This was followed by a heated debate between Jaitley and Jethmalani
 donon kii vakeelon kii team main bhi tikhi bahes hui maamle ko aage ke liye taalna padaa he
 The comments court ne is maamle main notice jari kar kejariwal ko safai dene ke liye bulaayaa he
 For information, let us know that Kejriwal's Advocate on record has clearly stated in the court that Kejriwal has not been asked to use such words in this case
 jabaki ram jethmalani ne court main kaha he ki is prakaar ke cross ikjamination ke liye unhen kejariwal se ijaajat mili he
 The correct disclosure of this will now be done only after Kejriwal's statement in court
 udhar, maamle main ek kanoonee pench yah bhi fansaa he ki kya court main hue is prakaar kii bhashaa ke istemaal par cese kiya ja saktaa he yaa nahin
 Nothing is clear on this yet
 itnaa jarur he ki ram jethmalani kii baat yadi sahi nikali to kejariwal ek or cese jhelenge or agar galat nikali to jethmalani ne vakeelon ke niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya he

 The comments court ne is maamle main notice jari kar kejariwal ko safai dene ke liye bulaayaa he
 For information, let us know that Kejriwal's Advocate on record has clearly stated in the court that Kejriwal has not been asked to use such words in this case
 jabaki ram jethmalani ne court main kaha he ki is prakaar ke cross ikjamination ke liye unhen kejariwal se ijaajat mili he

 udhar, maamle main ek kanoonee pench yah bhi fansaa he ki kya court main hue is prakaar kii bhashaa ke istemaal par cese kiya ja saktaa he yaa nahin
 Nothing is clear on this yet
 itnaa jarur he ki ram jethmalani kii baat yadi sahi nikali to kejariwal ek or cese jhelenge or agar galat nikali to jethmalani ne vakeelon ke niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya he
 It is believed that Ram Jethmalani and Arun Jaitley had a heated debate in the whole case
 maamla ek yah bhi nikalakar saamne aayaa ki jo ram jethmalani is cese ko free main ladane kii baat kar rahe the un desh ke sabase mahange vakil ke liye dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar ne karodon kii fees dene kaa jugad nikaal liya tha
 But the matter got stuck with the governor
 ab arvind kejariwal dilli ke mukhyamantri ke taur par is cese main ladaai ladane ke baat kah rahe hai
 Whatever the case may be, Thursday's court hearing took a new turn when Arjit Jaitley's Rajiv Nair and Sanjeev Sethi, arguing on behalf of Arun Jaitley, asked a question that could exacerbate Arvind Kejriwal's difficulties
 maamla kuch yun bhi ho saktaa he ki arvind kejariwal jo pehle hi 10 karod ke manahani ke maamle kaa cese lard rahe hai unhen ek or 10 karod kaa cese ladanaa na pad jaae
 During yesterday's hearing, the court termed many remarks made by Arvind Kejriwal's lawyer Ram Jethmalani in court on Arun Jaitley as defamatory
 court ne kaha ki agar is prakaar kii bhashaa kaa prayog karne ke liye arvind kejariwal kii ore se kaha gaya he tab is maamle main bahes ko aage lene jane kaa koi phayda nahin he
 For information, let us know that yesterday's hearing was held on an appeal by Raghav Chadha in which Arun Jaitley's lawyers took up the case
 jaj manmohan ne kaha ki aise main pehle kejariwal ko aakar apane aaropon par bayaan dena chahie
 This whole matter came to light when the lawyers appearing for Arun Jaitley's arguments told the court that it should be clear first that the language which Ram Jethmalani is using is being agreed with the consent of Arvind Kejriwal
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ram jethmalani yah kah chuke hai ki vah jo kah rahe hai wo arvind kejariwal kii taraf se kah rahe hai
 Jaitley's lawyers said that if Arvind Kejriwal has given permission to use such language against Arun Jaitley, then another 10 crore defamation case will be filed
 iske baad jaj manmohan ne latad lagaate hue saaf kaha ki jab pehle hi manahani kaa cese chal rahaa he tab is prakaar se bhashaa kaa prayog kar kisi kaa apmaan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In the court, the judge said that if the same thing happened in a rape case, it would have amounted to torture of the victim
 iske baad court ne kaha ki peedit ke vakil is maamle main doosraa cese bhi kar sakate hai
 Explain that while cross-examining Arun Jaitley in front of the joint registrar of the court, Ram Jethmalani used the word crook (deceiver)
 iske baad jetali or jethmalani main tikhi bahes hui
 Both the team of lawyers had a heated debate and had to postpone the case further
 tippaniyan The court has issued a notice in this case and called Kejriwal for clarification
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki kejariwal ke edwocket ne on record ne court main saaf kah diya he ki is maamle main kejariwal kii ore se is prakaar ke shabdon ke prayog ke liye nahin kaha gaya he
 Whereas Ram Jethmalani has said in the court that he has received permission from Kejriwal for such cross examination
 iskaa sahi khulaasa ab kejariwal ke court ke court main bayaan ke baad hi ho paaegaa
 On the other hand, a legal screw in the case is also implicated whether the use of such language in court can be done or not
 abhi is par kuch bhi saaf nahin he
 It is so certain that if the matter of Ram Jethmalani comes true, Kejriwal will face another case and if it turns out wrong, Jethmalani has violated the rules of the lawyers
 khayr maamla jo bhi ho, guuruuvaar kii court kii sunwaayee main us samay ek nayaa mode aa gaya jab arun jetali kii ore se bahes kar rahe rajeev nair or sanjeev sethi ne ek aisa prashn puch liya jisase arvind kejariwal kii mushkilen or bad sakati hai
 The matter may also be such that Arvind Kejriwal, who is already fighting a case of defamation of 10 crores, may not have to fight another 10 crores case
 kal kii sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne arvind kejariwal ke vakil ram jethmalani kii court main arun jetali par kii gai kai tippaniyon ko nindaatmak qaraar diya
 The court said that if Arvind Kejriwal has been asked to use this type of language, then there is no use to take the debate further in this matter

 sikhon kii dharmik sanstha akaal takht ke jatthedaar joginder singh vedanti ne apane pad se istifa de diya he
 He was made the Jathedar of Akal Takht in 2001
 kaha ja rahaa he ki deraa sachcha sauda ke prati narmi baratna or esajipisi kii andekhi karne kii qeemat vedanti ko istifa dekar chukaani padi
 Giani Joginder Singh Vedanti, the leader of the Akal Takht for the last 7 years, has a problem with his face
 vedanti kii maane to esajipisi ke do bade netaa, rajinder singh mehta or sukhdev singh bhore ne khud unhen istifa dene ke liye majaboor kiya
 There are several reasons behind the resignation from Joginder Singh Vedanti
 ek to america main khalistaan ke haq main bayaan diya, duusare parmaanu qaraar par uthe raajnneetik bavaal ke dauraan, vedanti ne deal kii himaayat karte hue pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii tarafadaari kii
 The Congress is calling Vedanti's resignation as damaging for Punjab
 vedanti ke istife ke peeche esajipisi ke adhyaksh avatar singh makkad se unke matbhedon ko bhi zimmedaar bataaya ja rahaa he
 It is also being said that Vedanti's wavering attitude against the Dera Sacha Sauda did not go down well with the SGPC

 The love, affection, blessing of the audience has taken me from floor to hail
 virdohi chaahe lakh koshish kar len par ham apane darshakon ke bich janaa jari rakhenge
 "he said that a handful of people cannot shake me from their path
 mujhe jo kuch bhi mila he, vah sab bhojpuria darshakon ke pyaar, dulaar, aashirwad ke bal par hi mila he
 All the audience and audience have a debt on me and i will continue to pay this debt for life
 unhone kaha ki puure bihar main is tarah kaa maahaul banaaya ja rahaa he ki kalakaar darshakon ke bich nahin jaayen
 There should be a high level of investigation
 gauratlab he ki pawan singh par hue jaanaleva hamale ke baad bhaajapa kala samskruti prakoshth ke adhyaksh barun kumaar singh ne is ghatana kii ninda karte hue kaha ki pawan singh bhojpuri ke sarvshereshth kalakaar he, saath hi saath ek umdaa insaan bhi hai
 We will write a letter to the Chief Minister to provide them all possible security
 saath hi saath unhone updraviyon ko sachet karte hue kaha ki kalakaar kisi jati yaa dharm kaa nahin hota vah to bas kala kaa pujari hota he or jo log bihar kaa naam puri duniya main roshan kar rahe hai
 We always look forward to honoring him

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator The editors of Hindi newspapers have made plans to assassinate their readers
 akhbaar kooday ke dher main badalte ja rahe hai
 Hindi newspapers now mostly carry the same items of propaganda
 pichley saadhe chaar saal main hindi akhbaaron yaa channelon se koi badi khabar saamne nahin ai
 With the help of language and metaphors stolen from the books of literature, Hindi journalists escape from the eyes of the readers
 khabar nahin he
 Is only a language game
 akhir jab baat khabaron ko khoj nikaalane or pehle panne par chhapane ke liye lagaataar padtaal kii hoti he tab hindi kaa patrkaar nazar kyon nahin aata he? aisa nahin he ki uske paas khabar nahin he, uski yogyata kisi se kam he magar akhbaaron ke maalik or ghulaam sampadak unki dhar kund kar detehain
 Is your Hindi newspaper or channel investigating the case of Alok Verma on its own? The High Power Committee sits before midnight
 alok verma ko hataa diya jaataa he
 Chief Justice of Supreme Court Ranjan Gogoi disassociates himself from that committee
 is aadhaar par ki faisla unhone likhaa he
 But the Prime Minister sits on that committee
 jabaki andeh kii sui un par he ki ve khud ko or ambani ko bachaane ke liye rafaal maamle ko dabaa sakate hai
 Ideally, the Prime Minister should have been separated from this committee
 kahana chahie tha ki supreme court hi faisla kare taaki janata ko andeh na ho
 The Supreme Court could also decide on the CVC whose report was decided on the basis
 di vir main rohinee singh kaa khulaasa to or bhi gambhir he
 Rohini Singh has written that KV Chaudhary, the Central Vigilance Commissioner visited Alok Verma's house
 choudhary chaahate the ki alok verma rakesh asthana ke khilaaf apni shikaayat waapas le len
 Alok Verma wrote this to Justice Patnaik
 jab rakesh asthana ne verma par aarope lagaae to supreme court ne justise patnayak ko kaam diya ki verma par lage aaropon kii jaanch ho
 The news of Rohini Singh has not yet been denied by CVC Chaudhary
 sochie ye haalat ho gai he
 Rohini Singh has written that Alok Verma was about to take a decision to sue Bhaskar Kulbe, an officer of the Prime Minister's Office
 koyala ghotaale main bhaskar kulbe kii bhoomika kii jaanch karnaa chaahate the
 Rakesh Asthana was opposing it
 isi ko lekar verma or asthana main ladaai chhid gai
 When the Supreme Court order was restored for 36 hours, then Alok Verma took a decision against Bhaskar Kulbe, but after his removal, the new acting director overturned all the decisions of Verma
 rohinee singh likhti hai ki kendriya satarkta ayukta ke ve choudhary ne supreme court se bhi yah baat chhipaai ki ve alok verma ke ghar gaye the or asthana kii taraf se baat kii thi
 This information is also important because the report given by the CVC against Verma is entirely based on Asthana's complaints
 choudhary chaahate the ki asthana kii salanaa kariyar report main jo pratikul tippanee kii gai he, verma use badal den
 Promotion stops due to adverse comment
 alok verma ke manaa kar dene ke baad rakesh asthana ne kendriya satarkta ayukta ko verma ke khilaaf shikaayatein bhejni shuru kar deen
 Based on that, Verma was removed
 verma ne asthana ke khilaaf jo shikaayatein kii us par koi sangyaan nahin letaa he
 Justice Patnaik has also told Seema Chishti of the Indian Express that the allegations in the report of the Central Vigilance Commissioner are not true
 niraadhaar hai
 Justice Patnaik has also told Rohini Singh that he stands by what he has told the Indian Express
 asthana ke khilaaf sibiai main jaanch ke chah-chah maamle lambit hai
 Asthana went to the Delhi High Court to dismiss the FIR, but the High Court on the contrary ordered the CBI to investigate within ten weeks
 ab aap bataaiye ki kya aapako lagata he ki alok verma ko hataane ke faisle main pradhanmantri ko padana chahie tha? naitikta kaa takaaza kya kahata he? kya ambani ke liye hukuumaten kuch bhi kar jaaengi? ab isi khabar ko aap apane kisi bhi hindi akhbaar main khojein
 Is any newspaper following up this news? It is not that the Hindi newspapers do not have the supposed journalists, but where are the reports? The government and the CVC do not mind because they know that such news will not reach the public through Hindi newspapers and channels
 aaj telegraph akhbaar ne purv chif justise tii es thakur ne bhi kaha ki alok verma ko apni baat rakhane kaa mauka dena chahie
 The evaluation of any government should start with the media condition of its era
 agar media hi azaad nahin he to phir aap kis soochna ke aadhaar par us sarkaar kaa moolyankan kar rahe hai, yah sawaal khud se puuchhen or apane hindi akhbaar or news channelon se puuchhen
 Do ask this question before everything goes to waste
 note- ek afvaah failaai ja rahi he ki alok verma ne maalya ko bhagane main madad kii
 The fact is that Verma became chief a year after Mallya's escape
 maalya puri sarkaar ke tantra kii madad se bhaaga tha
 Don't be so naive
 koi murkh banaae to kam se kam murkh na bane
 Amid the uproar, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said, "this is the draft list, not the final list
" agar kisi kaa naam final list main bhi nahin aata he, to bhi vah videshi nyaayaadhikaran main ja saktaa he
 No forceful action will be taken against anyone, so there is no need to panic
 "kendriya grahamantri ne kaha he ki kisi ko bhi ghabaraane kii zarurat nahin he, kyonki jinka naam list main nahin he, unke khilaaf kisi bhi tarah kii dandatmak karrwai nahin kii jaaegi
 The Union Home Minister said, "some people are unnecessarily trying to create an atmosphere of fear
 yah puri tarah nishpaksh report he
 No misinformation should be spread
 "(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed

 The most interesting thing is that such a huge production of cashew in Jamtara has started after a few years of hard work
 ilaake ke log bataate hai jamtada ke purv upayukta kripanand jha ko kaashew khaanaa behad pasand tha
 This is the reason why he wanted that if cashew plantations are built in Jamtara, then he will be able to eat fresh and cheap cashew nuts
 isi vajah se kripanand jha ne odisha main kaashew kii kheti karne waalon se mili
 He ascertained the geographical location of Jamtara with agricultural scientists
 iske baad yahaan kaashew kii bagwani shuru karai
 In a few years, cashew cultivation started in a big way
 kripanand jha ke yahaan se jane ke baad nimai chandra ghosh and company ko keval teen lakh rupye bhugtan par teen saal ke liye bagan kii nigaraanee kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya
 According to an estimate, thousands of quintal cashews flourish in the plantation every year
 dekharekh ke abhaav main sthaneey log or yahaan se guzarane vaale kaashew todakar le jate hai
 The comments kaashew kii bagwani main jute logon ne kai baar rajya sarkaar se fasal kii suraksha kii guhaar lagaai, par khaas dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 Last year, the government had talked of planting cashew plants on 100 hectares of land in Nala area
 paudharopan kii sabhi prakaar kii taiyaari vibhaag ne puri kar lee he
 The responsibility of planting cashew plant was given to the District Agriculture Department under the National Horticulture Mission, but the work on it has not started yet
 sarkaar ne ilaake ke kisaanon kii haalat sudhaarney ke liye yahaan kaashew kii bagwani badhaane or unhen uchit daam dilaane kaa vaada kar rahi he
 For this reason, Kripanand Jha met cashew cultivators in Odisha
 unhone krishi vaigyanikon se jamtada kii bhugolic sthiti kaa pataa kiya
 After this, cashew gardening was started here
 dekhte hi dekhte chand saal main yahaan kaashew kii bade paimaane par kheti hone lagi
 After Kripanand Jha left here, Nimai Chandra Ghosh & Co
 was given the task of supervising the plantation for three years on payment of only three lakh rupees
 ek anumaan ke mutabik bagan main har saal hajaaron quintal kaashew falte hai
 In the absence of care, the local people and the cashew people passing by take them away
 tippaniyan People engaged in cashew nut horticulture many times requested the state government for crop protection, but special attention was not given
 pichley saal sarkaar ne naala ilaake main 100 hectare bhoomi par kaashew ke paudhe lagaae jane kii baat kahi thi
 All types of plantation preparations have been completed by the department
 rashtriya bagwani mishan ke tahat kaashew paudha lagane kii jimmedaari jila krishi vibhaag ko di gai, lekin abhi tak isapar kaam nahin shuru ho sakaa he
 To improve the condition of the farmers of the area, the government is promising to increase cashew nut horticulture and provide them a reasonable price
 kripanand jha ke yahaan se jane ke baad nimai chandra ghosh and company ko keval teen lakh rupye bhugtan par teen saal ke liye bagan kii nigaraanee kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya

 ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ne party se baghawat kar bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar bana lee he
 Despite this, Sharad Pawar is not taking a hard stand against Ajit Pawar and the veteran leaders of NCP are constantly persuading him
 in sabake bich sharad pavaar ne dhai-dhai saal ke CM ke mudde ko hawa de diya he
 In such a situation, no one is able to guess what is going on in Sharad Pawar's mind
 ajit pavaar par soft sharad pavanjit pavaar ne ensipi ko todakar bijepi ke saath haath mila liya he
 Even after this, Sharad Pawar has neither shown Ajit Pawar out of the party nor taken any concrete action
 sharad pavaar puri tarah se ajit pavaar par soft rukh akhriyaar kiye hue hai
 The 'pawar family' is trying to somehow convince Ajit Pawar and bring him back to the NCP camp
 isi ke maddenjar sharad pavaar or supriya sule ne ajit pavaar ke bhai shrinivas se bhi baat kii he
 The veteran leader of NCP along with Ajit Pawar is churning in the assembly
 ajit pavaar ko chagan bhujabal or jayant patil jaise kai bade ensipi netaa manaane main jute hai
 Jayant Patil, the newly elected leader of the nsp's legislature party, has publicly invited Ajit Pawar to return
 jabaki nawab malik ne kaha he ki ajit pavaar se galati ho gai he, unhen dipti siem pad se istipha dekar party main vaapasi kerani chahie
 Two-and-a-half years in the midst of the cm's fight for power in Ragamaharashtra, Sharad Pawar said that we had demanded the Chief Minister's post for two-and-a-half years from the Shiv Sena, but there was a difference of opinion on this issue
 koi sahmati nahin ban pai thi
 Due to this, all this political disturbance has taken place
 jabaki, congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki dhai-dhai saal vaali baat unhen nahin pataa, ise sharad pavaar se hi puuchhie
 In such a situation, the question arises that NCP Sharad Pawar wants to give a political message through this statement
 kya sharad pavaar ne yah baat kahkar shivasena koishaaron-ishaaron main raajnneetik sandeshdhene kii koshish kii he
 The Shiv Sena had put a two-and-a-half-year CM formula in front of the BJP, on which the matter could not be reached
 aise main is raajnneetik sankat main jab shivasena baikfoot par he to kya sharad pavaar ne dhai-dhai saal siem kii baat ko rakhkar siyaasi saudebaaji kaa daanv chalaa he
 Also, Sharad Pawar said that nothing bad can happen to Shiv Sena, because i have promised him
 unhone kaha ki teenon partiyon ko milakar 5 saal tak sarkaar chalaani he, isliye kuch bhi jaldi main nahin hona chahie
 In such a situation, neither the Congress nor the Shiv Sena leaders understand what is going on in Sharad Pawar's mind

 newjiland ke governor general anand satyanand is varsh sammelan ke mukhya atithi hai
 The Prime Minister's advisor Sam Pitroda said, "we are going to spend about $ 100 billion on education in the 12th five-year Plan
 " unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne shiksha ke kshetra main adhik nivesh kii khatir nijee or pravaasiyon ke liye dwaar khule rakhe hai
 Pitroda said, "our intention is to liberalize the education system
 1991 main hamane arthvyavastha ko sudhaarney ke liye jo kiya, vah ab shiksha ke liye karne kii jarurat he
 "he asked overseas Indians to invest in India's education sector

 kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne beete 20 march koucch shikshake 62 sansthaanon ko puri swaittata pradaan karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 He said that the government wants to establish a liberal system in the field of education and is emphasizing on linking autonomy with quality
 jaavdekar ne sarkaar ke is kadam ko aitihaasik bataaya
 This is historical but not the way the education minister and the government claim
 agar is baar ke bajet main ucch shiksha ko mili rakam or swaittata sambandhi vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog (ujisi) kii adhisuchana kii sharton ko dekhen to yah saaf ho jaataa he ki sarkaar darasal shiksha se haath peeche khinch rahi he
 In the UGC notification of 12 February 2018 on autonomy to universities, it has been said to give autonomy to institutions in two categories
 donon hi shreniyon main sansthaanon ko kuch chhot di gai hai jinamein ujisi se anumati lene kii jarurat nahin he
 But its condition is that the institutions will have to raise funds for it themselves and they will not ask for any grant from the government
 isse jaahir he ki sarkaar darasal in sansthaanon ko is kathith swaittata ke badale fund nahin degi
 Institutions with Category-1 autonomy can open new courses, school centers etc
 or even remote campuses without the approval of UGC
 lekin shart vahi he ki ve sarkaar se fund nahin maangenge
 At the same time category-2 institutions can open new courses, schools etc
 without approval, but UGC should be allowed at the time of remote campus, but inspection will not be required while granting permission
 lekin in sabaki shart bas yahi he ki sarkaar se kisi bhi tarah ke fund kii ummid santhaan nahin karenge
 Similarly, in the budget, the budget of all the autonomous institutions of higher education like universities, iits, iims etc
 in the budget is about Rs
 kii katautee kar di
 It is also clear that the government is withdrawing from higher education
 is kathith swaittata kii keemat chaatro ko hi chukaani padegi
 Actually these institutes can raise their funds only by increasing the fees of students etc
 duusari baat ki unhen nijee kshetron fund jutanaa hoga aise main jo paisa degaa, jaahir he sansthaanon ko unke haathon apni swaittata ganvaane yaa prabhavit hone kaa khatra barkaraar rahegaa
 This is the reason that student and teacher organizations are considering it as an exercise of privatization of education

 This story is 70 years old
 saal 1947 main duniya ke nakshe par do mulkon kaa janm hua
 One India, the other Pakistan
 pakistan islam dharm ke aadhaar par banane vaala duniya kaa pehla mulk bana
 Since the partition, till date Pakistan has made 5 important mistakes, which not only made it on the verge of ruin, but also divided it into two pieces
 yahaan ham aapako bantwaare se lekar barbaadi tak pakistani kii wo 5 galtiyaan bataaenge
 These mistakes that changed the dates of the history of Pakistan
 1- pakistan kaa remote washington disi ke haath main pahunchnaa1945 main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad america teji se mahashakti banakar ubharne laga
 But Russia gave him a tough fight
 lihaaja vishwa do kheme main bant gaya
 India and Pakistan, liberated in 1947, two years after the Second World War, had two routes
 yaa to america kheme main jate yaa phir rus ke
 India chose the third path to non-alignment
 yani donon se baraabar duuri banaakar apni khud kii raah bananaa
 But Pakistan made the biggest mistake here
 pakistan 1947 ke baad se hi america kheme main shaamil hone ke liye washington disi ke chakkar kaatane laga tha
 But in the beginning, America did not grass it
 saal 1953 main america siyasat main ek badlaav hua
 John Foster Dalles became the foreign minister of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower
 dales ne 1954 main america ke liye ek niti banaai
 This policy was to intensify the Cold War against Russia all over the world
 rus ko gherne ke liye america ko madhya asia, south asia se lekar puri duniya main samrik sahyogi chahie the
 Just here, lottery of Pakistan started
 darasal, pakistan ke jariye america afghanistan main lagaataar bad rahe rus ke dakhal ko khatm karnaa chahta tha
 Therefore, during this period, the US entered into military alliances with many countries of the world including Pakistan
 jisamen baghdad pact, sento, sito jaise pact shaamil hai
 In order to serve its interests through Pakistan, America started giving money and weapons to Pakistan with an open hand
 america ke ishaare par pakistan afghanistan main jehad kaa naaraa buland karne laga
 Overall, Pakistan became a slave to America, liberated from British fetters
 ab uskaa remote control landan kii jagah washington disi se sanchalit hone laga
 The ruling of Pakistan's rulers to go with the US after Partition turned out to be far-reaching
 mote taur par iske teen nattejey saamne aae-(a)pakistan kii iconomi or fouj puri tarah se america ke paison par nirbhar ho gai
 Free money made Pakistan's rulers ineffective
 aaj bhi jaise hi america haath peeche khinchataa he pakistan ke haath-paanv phoolne lagate hai
 (b) America did not need the citizens of Pakistan but the army that it wanted to use to stop Russia from spreading its foot in Afghanistan
 lihaaja pakistan main fouj kii ahmiyat zyada bad gai, joki loktantr kii bhaavana ke khilaaf tha
 (c) In democracy, rules, laws, elections, judiciary are powerful, but going to America, all of them in Pakistan were endangered because America did not want to do so
 pakistan main naa to chunaav hue naa hi nyaaypalika ko wo darja mila jo jamhuriyat main miltaa he
 It happened that the bureaucrats and the army seized power by forming alliances keeping the rights of the citizens at bay
 nateeja ye hua kii pakistan main sena sarvesarva ho gai
 Three wars (1947, 1965, 1971) occurred with India under the influence of the army
 teenon hi yudhon main pakistan kii buree tarah se haar hui or antah 1971 main pakistan do bhaagon main tut gaya
 Bangladesh becomes a new country
 is bich pakistan main naa to udyog dhandhe khadey ho paae or naa hi krishi par dhyaan diya gaya
 As a result, the army and bureaucrat class in Pakistan became very rich due to the bailout money from America, but the people were forced to live below poverty
 berozegaar yuvakon ko fouj ne paise kaa laalach dekhakar afghanistan or bharat ke khilaaf aatank ke raste par dhakel diya
 Poverty, hunger and terrorism became the hallmark of Pakistan throughout the world
 2- pakistani fedral court kaa doorgaami faislapakistan kii duusari sabase badi galati kaa taalluk pakistan kii nyaaypalika se hai
 The Constituent Assembly was formed in 1954 in Pakistan
 us samay governor general the gulam mohammad
 He dissolved the Constituent Assembly
 us samay pakistan main governor general or raashtrapati kaa ek hi ohada hota tha
 Maulvi Tamizuddin was the speaker of Sindh Assembly at that time
 tamizuddin hai court chale gaye
 The Sindh High Court, while giving a major verdict, not only rejected the decision of Governor General Ghulam Mohammad, but also restored the Constituent Assembly
 governor general gulam mohammad iske khilaaf apil main fedral court pahunch gaye
 At that time the Supreme Court of Pakistan was called the Federal Court
 fedral court ke chif justise the mohammad munir
 Justice Munir gave the verdict in 1955 and set a new precedent, giving a new concept of 'law-a-need'
 unhone apane faisle main kaha ki 'lau of nececity' ke tahat governor general gulam mohammad kaa faisla sahi tha
 For the first time in the history of Pakistan, such a concept named 'drishti-e-mardali' came out which changed the fate of Pakistan itself
 loktantr kii hatya karte hue sanvaidhanik sanstha ke vajood ko mitaa diya gaya
 This constitutional body of Pakistan was to go ahead and be transformed into a parliamentary assembly like India
 isi sanvaidhanik sanstha ko aage chalakar pakistan main chunaav kaa elaan karnaa tha
 'law-a-need' became a sore throat of Pakistan
 isi kanoon kii vajah se baad main ayub khan ke takhta palat ko kanoonee jama pahanaaya gaya, yahaya khan ne takhta palat ko sahi tehraaya
 zia-ul-haq termed the coup as lawful and finally General Pervez Musharraf's coup was upheld
 'kanoon-e-jarurat' kaa faisla dene vaale justise munir ne saal 1984 main apni kitaab 'from jinna tu jiya' main khud mana kii unke ek faisle se pakistan kii takadir badal gai
 3- Disputed decision of Pakistani Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra In 1954, Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra introduced a disputed formula
 is formule ko pakistan ke itihaas main bogra formula ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Under the formula, all the provinces of West Pakistan (including states, princely states, Swat, tribal areas) were to be merged into one province
 is faisle main swat, kabaili or praant kii sthaneey swayatta, pahchaan, samskruti ko khatm karke inhen ek rajya main shaamil karne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 Similarly, it was said to tie East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) into a province
 1954 main bogra sahab ne elaan kiya or 1955 main inhone aisa kar diya
 After this, when Ayub Khan came to power, he implemented it legally and strengthened
 pakistan ko do subo main (pashchimi pakistan or purvi pakistan) main baant diya gaya
 It was also implemented in the Pakistani Constitution of 1962
 is vivaadit faisle kaa bahut hi bhayanak nateeja saamne aayaa
 The voice of freedom began to rise in different states of Pakistan
 1955 ke baad se aaj tak baluchistan puri duniya main yahi kah rahaa he ki bandook kii nonk par pakistan se use apane kabje main liya he
 Baluchistan says that during the partition of 1947, the quaid-e-azam Jinnah of Pakistan did not comply with the promises of Pakistan to the people of Baluchistan
 jinna ne vaada kiya tha ki baluchistan pakistan kaa hissaa bhale hi hoga lekin uskaa apana khud kaa shashan hoga
 Will have its own law
 1955 ke baad se yahi baat pakhtoon kehane lage ki unhen to pakhtunistan bananaa tha, unhen khud apana kanoon bananaa tha
 Governance was to be erected
 lekin unhen to jabaran sena ne bandook kii nonk par pakistan kaa hissaa bana rakhaa he
 In 1955, the voice of partition (baluchistan, Pakhtunistan) was raised after the decision of Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra in which he combined all the provinces of eastern and western part of Pakistan to form two separate units or states
 decided
 pakistan ko ek kendriya unit banane ke bogra sahab ke faisle ko jab satta main aae ayub khan ne jabaran desh par thopanaa chaha to ayub khan ke kaarykaal main hi baluchistan main pehali baar vidroh shuru hua
 The seeds which were sown in East Pakistan and West Pakistan during the time of Ayub Khan started the process of economic discrimination, discrimination with people at regional level, persecution of people in Pakistan
 purvi pakistan (jo ab bangladesh he) kehane laga ki ham jute se kamaate hai or phayda pashchim pakistan vaale le jate hai, sara vikaas sirf pashchimi pakistan main ho rahaa he
 However, the reality was that even in West Pakistan, development was taking place only in Punjab province and Karachi
 baluchistan or seemaant ilaakon main koi bhi vikaas nahin hua
 Nor did development appear in the areas of Sindh
 iljaam lagane laga kii pakistan main punjab kshetra ke rahanevaale log haaavee hai
 People of Punjabi Civil Military rule Pakistan
 is tarah kii bhaavana kii vajah sirf pakistan ko ek soobe main jabaran banane kii vajah se shuru hua or iskaa pehla nateeja 1971 main dikhaa jab pakistan do tukdon main bant gaya
 Now Baluchistan is also fighting to secede from Pakistan
 agar pakistan ne shuru se hi bharat kii tarah kshetreey asmita ko dhyaan diya hota to pakistan main vidroh kii awaajen naa uthati
 One thing to be understood here is that the military and the bureaucracy always believe in the central command
 power kaa cmand ek haath main rakhane kii avadharana fouj kii he
 Political people adopt the policy of decentralization
 siyasat daan shakti ko baantne par vishwaas karte hai
 This is the reason that when the central command started during Musharraf's tenure, the voice of rebellion in Balochistan intensified
 is daur main pakistan ke har masale par fouj ke jaranlon kii ahmiyat bad gai
 4- Not recognizing the results of the elections held in East Pakistan when Yahya Khan came to power in Pakistan, elections were held there
 chunaav hue to bengal (purvi pakistan) ke logon ko ek mauka mil gaya apane gusse kaa izhaar karne kaa
 East Pakistan was overwhelmingly voted for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his Awami League won a majority
 pakistan kii sabase badi galati ye thi usne chunaav ke nateezon ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 Had Pakistan agreed to the election at that time, it would not have been broken
 pakistan kii civil-military naukarshahi ne jisamen ab raajnneetik log bhi shaamil ho gaye the (julfikaar ali bhutton ne pashchimi pakistan main bahumat hasil kiya tha) sab ne milakar mujiburrahman ko ijaajat nahin di kii wo pakistan ke pradhanmantri bane
 The special thing was that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was also with this decision of the army
 lihaaja, purvi pakistan main iskaa jamkar virodh hua or vidroh shuru ho gaya
 Pakistan started military action against it
 lakhon log maut ke ghat utaar die gaye
 Refugees started arriving in India from East Pakistan
 bharat ne mujeeb ke madad kii peshkash kii
 Mujib agreed
 unhone ne kaha ki pakistan ke liye sabase zyada qurbaaniyaan bengal ke musalamaanon ne di thi lekin pashchimi pakistan use hameshaa se hikaarat kii najar se dekhtaa rahaa
 Since the 1965 war, india-pakistan relations were extremely bitter
 hindustan ne hastkshep kiya or purvi pakistan main vahaan kii janata kii madad ke liye apni sena bhej di
 Pakistan is split into two
 5- afghanistan main pakistan kaa bevajaah dakhal denifghanistan hameshaa se rus kaa satellite tha
 The internal situation took place there in such a way that the communist party took over
 pehle bhi jab vahaan par rajshahi thi tab bhi unke tallukaat rus ke saath the
 Just as Pakistan was the outpost of America, similarly Afghanistan was also the outpost of Russia
 ye baat america ko khatkati thi
 America told Pakistan to start jihad in Afghanistan
 iske liye america ne pakistan ko paise dene shuru kiye
 zia-ul-haq inexplicably attacked Afghanistan in the greed to take money and weapons from America
 pakistan main buddhajivi pakistan ke is kadam ko kiraye ke kaatil kii sangya dete hai
 In Afghanistan, the sentiment spread that Pakistan has become a murderer on American money
 8 se 10 saal ke baad jab america yahaan se chalaa gaya to pakistan akelaa pad gaya
 Meanwhile, the military rule of zia-ul-haq Saheb continued for 10 years in Pakistan
 chunaav nahin ho paae
 During this time Pakistan got a lot of money from America
 paisa mila to fouj kii takat bad gai
 The military's capacity also increased
 faujee afasaron or naukarshahon kii tijori bharti rahi lekin awam ko kuch nahin mila
 Since the military had to promote jihad, the undemocratic attitude had to be justified, so the army was falsely Islamized
 islam ke naam par pakistani janata ko bargalaaya gaya ki chunki fouj islam kii raksha kar rahi he, isliye pakistan main loktantr kii zarurat nahin he
 The result was very dangerous
 pakistan main islam ke naam par maar-kaat much gai
 Conflict started in cultures
 jehad, aatankwaad, hinsa, shiya-sunni sangharsh ko fouj ne hawa di
 The radical forces that Pakistan is struggling with today are all due to needless interference at the behest of America in Afghanistan
 war on teror bhi isi vajah se saamne aayaa
 Today the Pakistani army is upset about the fact that the jihadis are now upside down
 aaj pakistan main shiya-sunni sangharsh bad gaya he, talibani barelviyon ko maar rahe hai
 Is there a fight that is Islam? The reason for all these battles is the result of Pakistan's intervention in Afghanistan during zia-ul-haq in the 1980s
 iskaa parinaam ajtak bhugat rahaa he pakistan
 Before the intervention of Pakistan, people used to visit not only Pakistan but also the whole world in Kabul
 afghanistan kaa mausam bahut acha tha or vahaan par rus ke dakhal kii vajah se pashchimi samskruti kaa bol bala tha
 All this jihad, fighting, killing and bloodshed that started in 1980 and lasted 10 years
 phir iske baad 10 saal afghanistan main jihadiyon or mujahiddeenon kaa grihayuddh chalaa
 And then Afghanistan became a stronghold of the Taliban, the US, and terrorists around the world
 pichley 30 saal lekar afghanistan main asthirataa kaa maahaul he usase pehle vahaan par aman-chaiyn tha
 Together with America, Pakistan made it hell and now the terrorists of Afghanistan have made Pakistan hell
 kuch roj pehle tak tarun tejpal ke paas sab kuch tha
 The pen had strength
 daulat kii chamak thi
 In the blink of an eye, he had a sharp talent for mixing goodwill with goodwill
 lekin 7 or 8 november ko goa ke ek five star hotel main is shaks ne apni hi maatahat ek ladki ke saath jo kuch kiya, usne kabhi asia ke sabase taqatvar patrakaron main gine gaye tarun tejpal ke kile main aisi send lagaai ki ab tejpal ke liye naa to apana garh bachaana mumkin ho rahaa he or naa hi khud ko
 It was a drug of strength
 bade or hai profile tabake main apni ahsaas-e-maujuudagi kaa gurur
 Or the misunderstanding of shaking anyone's cradle
 
 
 raat ke andhere main lift ke bheetar tejpal ne apni hi megzin yani tahalaka main kaam karanevaali ek ladi janarlist ke saath jo kuch kiya, usne raaton-raat tejpal ke takadir ke sitare gardish main pahunchaa die
 On 20 November, Tejpal decided to step down from the highest chair of Tehelka for six months, but from the same day all the circumstances turned against him
 iske baad to jaise baat badi or badhati chali gai
 Earlier, the girl, who had only complained to her managing editor, got her statements recorded before the police and magistrate and upon seeing Tarun Tejpal surrounded by legal troubles
 tejpal ke sting se khaar khaae log bhi mauka tadkar tejpal par tut pade or duusari ore tejpal ke sir par giraftaar kaa khatra mandaraane laga
 The police would sometimes issue summons in the name of Tejpal, sometimes he would get a non-bailable warrant from the court, and in the midst of this grudge, Friday ie November 29 proved to be the most turbulent day in the life of this fast-paced journalist
 subah tak to tejpal apane ghar se nadaarad rah kar police se bachate rahe, lekin din chadhate-chadhate tejpal ko adaalat se kishton main raahat milane lagi
 First three hours and then until ten in the morning the next day
 isi bich apane anjaam se anjaan tejpal dilli tu goa ke ek aise safar par ravaanaa hue, jo vaise to faqat dhai ghante kaa tha, lekin shaayad tejpal ke liye dhai sau ghante se bhi zyada
 
 
 After all, Tejpal was once again in the same Goa, from where his fate star started sinking
 jin tarun tejpal par lage yon shoshan ke iljaamon se puure desh main tahalaka machaa hua he, shuukravaar kii dopaher ko vahi tarun tejpal thik 12
 At 58 minutes, she was spotted at Delhi's Indira Gandhi Airport to go to Goa
 pichley kuch dinon se goa police haath dho kar tejpal ke peeche padi thi or wo har baar police ke haath se phisal jate
 But when Tejpal appeared at the Delhi airport on Friday afternoon to go to Goa by air, he could neither escape the media cameras nor the uniforms
 police ne fouran unhen gher liya
 Tejpal may not be able to control it so easily, but during the last 24 hours, the Goa police tightened the law against him so fast that there was no way for him to catch a flight directly to Goa
 police ke saamne hajir hone kii dedline se chukne ke saath hi usne guuruuvaar ko hi panaji ke seshan court se tejpal ke naam gairajamaanti warrant hasil kar liya tha
 And on Friday morning, the same Goa police was raiding Tejpal's house
 lekin munh andhere hui is dabish dene ke baavjood police ko unka koi suraag haath nahin laga
 However, when Tejpal's wife told the police not to meet her husband for the last 24 hours even after nearly two hours of questioning, the police left Tejpal's house
 jaahir he ab tak goa police ke saath tejpal kii lucatipi kaa khel jari tha or isi silsile main ab police ne dilli se goa janevaali har flite kii talaashi lene kaa faisla kiya
 Police along with Delhi Crime Branch investigated the booking of every flight along with several Tejpal locations in Delhi
 tejpal dilli hai court main daakhil apni agrim jamaanat arji pehle hi waapas le chuke the
 In such a situation, they had no other way to avoid arrest
 lihaaja, court kaa vakt shuru hote hi tejpal ke vakil usee court main ja pahunche, jahaan se unke par police ne gaiyr jamaanti warrant hasil kiya tha
 The benefit of Tejpal's effort was that he got relief from his arrest till 2:30 pm from the court
 jaahir he, ab tejpal ek baar phir khuli hawa main saans le sakate the
 And after this dedication from the court, he left Delhi with his lawyer and family members to go to Goa
 ghar waalon ne sochaa tha ki unka tarun bada hokar koi bada adhikari banegaa
 But three dreams floated one after another in Tarun's eyes
 pehla sapana tha kitaab likhnaa
 Second Sapna is coming on TV and third Sapna is starting its own dot com
 in sapanom par savaar hokar chandigarh se dilli tak tarun tejpal ek se badhakar ek kila fateh karte rahe
 But the fort of his own conduct and faith has fallen straight to the frame of law
 tejpal ke khulasetahalaka ne tejpal kii soch ke daayre ko vistaar diya
 And in the name of Tehelka, his dot-com earned his reputation and credibility in the world of investigative journalism
 2007 main tahalaka ne ye sting kiya tha ki kaise gujarat ke naroda patia main bijepi, viechpi or bajrang dal ke logon ne dange karaae the
 Tejpal had also revealed how Dayanidhi Maran was involved in the Rs 700 crore telecom scam
 or kaise dilli main badhati balaatkaar kii ghatnaayen dilli police kii gaiyr-jimmedaar ravaiye kaa nateeja hai
 But coincidentally, the same Tejpal is facing legal sections of rape today
 dilli se goa tak
 But before removing his dream magazine named Tehelka, Tarun Tejpal also showed the magic of his pen
 saal 2005 main tarun tejpal kaa upanyaas da alkemi of dijair chhapakar saamne aayaa
 Tejpal's novel 8 years ago, Tejpal wrote such a novel about sexual exploitation that he made a splash in the world
 tarun tejpal ke is pehle upanyaas 'da alkemi of dizaayar' ko bed sex award ke liye chunaa gaya tha 
 Incidentally, after 8 years, Tarun Tejpal himself is standing in the box of this bad sex
 britain kaa yah puraskaar usee kitaab ko diya jaataa he jisamen yon kriya kaa sabase zyada sharmnaak varnan ho
 See also the coincidence that the victim's email, based on which the Goa police registered a case, considers it to be the most shameful in Goa
 khaas baat yah he ki tarun tejpal ke is upanyaas ko francisi sahitya puraskaar pricks femina kii antim suchi main bhi chunaa gaya jisaki jeuri main sirf mahilaayein hoti hai or sanyog dekhiye ki tarun tejpal ko lekar unki apni patrika tahalaka kii mahilaon ne hi sabase pehle istipha dena shuru kiya kyonki vah tarun tejpal ke yon utpeedan par di gai unki daleelon se behad aahat thim
 Tarun Tejpal, who colored investigative journalism to glamor, earned a lot
 naam ke saath bada daam bhi
 From a journalist to a businessman
 lekin sab kuch kamaane ke nashe main shaayad tejpal supreme court kii vishakha guidelins ko bhul gaye or bhul gaye sampadak kii garima ko
 The result is flying from the earth to the sky
 peedita kaa dard'mujhe pataa nahin ki main khud yaa phir mere dost or samarthak mujhe ab bhi ek balaatkaar kii shikaar ladki ke taur par dekhne ko taiyaar hai yaa nahin
 
 
 But the truth is that it does not decide everything, rather it determines the law
 
 
 or is maamle main kanoon bilkul saaf he, tejpal ne mere saath jo kuch kiya, wo rape yani balaatkaar ke daayre main hi aata he
 'these alphas are that brave girl who has created a panic in the entire country by accusing her of sexual harassment against Tehelka Chief and well-known journalist Tarun Tejpal
 shuukravaar ko is ladki ne media ko die gaye apane bayaan main naa sirf apana dil khol kar rakh diya, balki ye bhi bataaya ki tamaam mushkilon ke baavjood wo kaise is ladaai main dati hui he
 The girl has said, 'like Tejpal, this fight is not a battle of wealth and influence, but a battle of honor
 ye bataane kii ladaai he ki meraa jism mere niyokta kii jaagir nahin he
 But the reality is that after registering this complaint, i have not only lost my favorite job but also economic self-reliance, but have also prepared myself for personal attacks
 ye ladaai aasaan nahin he
 If the aggrieved girl thanked the people for supporting her in this fight, she also took a dig at those who raised her fingers
 usne kaha, 'agar is ladaai main main chaaron ore se mil rahe samarthan ke liye logon kaa shukraguzaar hum to meri ladaai ko chunaav se pehle kii siyaasi sajeesh bataane jaise kuch bayanon kii vajah se aahat bhi hum
 ' bharat ke sabase ahm rankshetra maane jane vaale rajya main raajnneetik kanta bijepi se hatakar samaajawaadee-congress gathbandhan kii disha main mudana shuru ho gaya he
 How far the fork stops at the end will depend on whether the BJP manages to cross the finishing line as the winner or is defeated in front of the akhilesh-rahul alliance
 upi chunaav se pehle india today group ke liye exis-maai india kii ore se kiye gaye aakhri opinian pole ke mutabik pichley opinian pole kii tulana main bijepi ke khate main 25 siton kii kami ai he
 The last opinion poll was in December and the latest opinion poll was done in January
 exis-maai india ke anumaan ke mutabik tatkaal chunaav hone par bijepi ko upi main 180 se 191 seat milane ja rahi hai
 But the sp-congress alliance is also not far behind
 is gathbandhan ko 168-178 seat milane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he
 The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is seen to suffer the most from the alliance
 bispi ko disambar se janvari ke bich 40 siton kaa nuksaan hota dikh rahaa he
 In the last one month, there has been a big fluctuation in the share of vote share of all the important political forces
 bispi ek maheene main apane vot share kaa paanchvaan hissaa khote dikhi
 The vote share of this party decreased from 26% to 20
 1% par aa gaya
 The data from the 'pataidja Opinion Poll' of the alliance showed that the Samajwadi Party's vote share has increased by 7% with the Samajwadi Party's cycle joining the Congress hand
 opinian pole ke mutabik espi ke paas 26 fisadi hai
 But this alliance 33 after being aligned with the Congress
 2% vot milane kaa anumaan he
 However, the bjp's own vote share is unaffected by this new alliance
 asaliyat ye he ki bijepi kaa apana vot share jo disambar main 33% dikh rahaa tha wo janvari main bad kar 34
 8%
 upi main chunaav ab mote taur par bijepi or espi-congress gathbandhan ke bich do ghodon kii daud sareekha ho gaya he
 In December, BJP had a 100-seat lead over nearest rival SP
 lekin ab akhilesh-rahul ke saath ne upi ke raajnneetik samikarnon ko puri tarah badal daalaa he
 Although the Congress is a marginal power in the state, it has helped to increase 76 seats for the so-called secular coalition in a span of one month
 agar upi chunaav kii tulana ghuddaud se kii jaae to disambar main bijepi kaa ghoda kahin aage daud rahaa tha
 But in January its speed started to decline
 duusari ore, espi ke ghode ko congress se shaktivardhak khuraaq mili to isane pehle se kahin tej raftaar se daudna shuru kar diya
 The next few weeks will decide whether the bjp's horse manages to retain its lead or is defeated by the opponent in the last stretch
 philhal, do mukhya pratidwandviyon main vot share kaa antar 1
 Hinges at less than 6%, which itself falls within the 'margin of error'
 survey ke bich hua gathbandhanin chunavi ankon par najar daalate vakt ye dhyaan main rakhana jaruri he ki exis kii tiimon ne taaja opinian pole ke liye 15 janvari ke baad se jamini kaam karnaa shuru kiya tha
 At that time there was agitation about the coming of the coalition but there was some uncertainty as well
 aisa gathbandhan ke liye baatcheet tuutane kii lagaataar report aane kii vajah se tha
 The sp-congress alliance was finally announced on 22 January
 lekin tab tak exis kii ore se survey kaa 40% kaam puraa ho chukaa tha
 The study of caste data during the three Axis Polls revealed interesting facts about how up's electoral mathematics has been changing
 beete ek maheene main espi-congress gathbandhan ke paksh main yadav or muslimon kaa khaasaa jamaavada hua he
 In December, 72% of the Yadavs said they would vote for the SP
 janvari main ye aakanda 10% badhkar 82% ho gaya
 One big reason for this is that in December, half of the Yadavs who were talking about voting in favor of BJP turned to SP
 disambar main muslimon main se 71% ne kaha tha ki veesapeco vot denge
 In January, this figure increased to 74%
 espi ko congress ke saath gathbandhan karne se savarna voton kaa 19% hissaa apane saath laane main madad mili he
 In December alone, the SP was getting only 9% of the upper caste voters
 is bich, beete ek maheene main bispi sabhi jati virgon main kuch naa kuch samarthan khoti najar ai
 On the other hand, in the last one month, there has been a mobilization of Other Backward Classes (OBC) and upper caste votes in favor of BJP
 bijepi ke liye disambar main 53% obisi jhukaav dikhaa rahe the, janvari main ye badhkar 56% ho gaya he
 On the other hand, the bjp's support has increased from 61% in December to 68% in January
 purvi upi main bijepi ko badhat to pashchim main gathbandhan ageupi opinian pole ke aankadon ko agar kshetravaar baanta jaae to bijepi ko purvi upi main saaf badhat dikh rahi he
 There are a total of 167 seats in this region
 exis ke anumaan ke mutabik purvi upi main bijepi ko 89 siten milane ja rahi hai
 At the same time, 55 seats can go to the account of sp-congress alliance
 bispi ko 22 siton par hi santosh karnaa pad saktaa he
 If we talk about 136 seats in western UP, then due to the large number of Muslims being united here, the sp-congress can get 68 seats in the account
 pashchimi upi main bijepi ko 53 seat mil sakati hai
 At the same time, the BSP is seen winning only 13 seats
 madhya upi ko paaramparik taur par samaajawaadee party kaa garh mana jaataa rahaa he
 Of the total 81 seats here, the sp-congress alliance is projected to get 47, BJP 31 and BSP only 3 seats
 bundelkhand upi kaa sabase chota kshetra he
 Here BJP can get 12 seats, sp-congress alliance 4 and BSP 3 seats
 aise main bada sawaal ye he ki jab halaat espi-congress gathbandhan ke liye makul hote ja rahe hai to kya akhilesh or rahul matganana vaale din narendra modi or amit shah ko pachhaadne main kaamyaab rahenge? ye sab is par nirbhar karata he ki agle ek maheene main prachaar ke dauraan kya kya saamne aata he?muslim or yadav espi-congress gathbandhan ke peeche ekajute ho rahe hai to iske jawaab main obisi or savarnon kaabijepike samarthan main jamaavada ho rahaa he
 The Hindu votes could increase further in the next one month
 bihar se alag hat kar upi kaa sampradayik dhruvikaran kaa lanbaa itihaas rahaa he
 The BJP used it successfully in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 agar prachaar ke dauraan sampradayik paara or chadhataa he to hindu voton kaa ek ghat par aana bijepi ko team akhilesh or rahul ke jatigat ganit kaa muqabla karne main madad kar saktaa he
 At the same time, the SP and the Congress campaign vigorously, field the right candidates, as well as if a large number of upper caste candidates are betted by the secular alliance, then the upper castes will probably be limited in support of the BJP
 
 kyonki kai savarna matadaata gathbandhan kii ore se khadey kiye gaye savarna ummidavaaron ke paksh main vot kar sakate hai
 Another big swing factor is the Dalit vote
 abhi tak exis ke teenon opinian pole ke dauraan jatav or gaiyr jatav vot, donon hi bispi ke paale main khadey najar aate rahe
 But as the discussion on the weakening of the bsp's position is gaining momentum, there is a possibility that some of the non-jatavs may change their preference to vote
 saaf shabdon main kahen to muslim or yadav espi-congress gathbandhan ke peeche khadey najar aa rahe hai
 In contrast, the upper castes and obcs are coming together in favor of the BJP
 lekin aakhir main dalit vot kahaan jayega, yahi tay karegaa ki upi kii gaddi par kiskaa rajtilak hoga?uttar pradeshki jang ab bhi khuli he
 The next one month is probably going to witness one of the most rigorous and thorny elections in the country's latest electoral history
 aaie bisaat lagaai jaae
 In Delhi, two children died after a TV burst in Khoda Colony in Ghazipur on Saturday
 jab yehaadasahua, donon bachche ghar main tivi par cartoon dekh rahe the

 khera ne apana istipha dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal ko patr likhakar di he or kai aarope bhi lagaae hai
 Let me tell you that some time ago, Sukhpal Khaira revolted against the AAP leadership and he was suspended from the party
 haalanki, sukhpal khera kuch vidhayakon ko saath lekar kendriya netritv ke khilaaf bavaagat tej kar di thi
 However, the resignation of Sukhpal Khaira after HS Phulka is not true from the standpoint of the Aam Aadmi Party before the Lok Sabha elections
 sukhpal singh khera ne aarope lagaaya ki party us vichaardhaara evam siddhanton se “puri tarah bhatak chuki” he jinke aadhaar par anna hajaare andolan ke baad uskaa gathan hua tha
 Khaira, who was suspended from the party in November last year for his involvement in anti-party activities, has sent his resignation letter to aap's national convenor Arvind Kejriwal
 bolath se vidhayak ne apane tyaagptr main kaha, “desh kii panrparik partiyon kii vartmaan raajnneetik samskruti buree tarah bighad chuki he jiske chalate aap ke gathan se bahut ummiden jagin thim

 The Aam Aadmi Party argued that Khaira was constantly involved in anti-party activities and was constantly targeting the central and state party leadership
 aap se apane nilamban par pratikriya main sukhpal khera ne is nirnay ko ‘‘taanaashaahee'' bataaya tha or kaha tha ki vah vidhayakon or party kaaryakartaaon ke saath baithak karenge or aage ke kadam par nirnay karenge
 Khaira Khema has been demanding autonomy for aap's Punjab unit
 is kheme ko kuch aap vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil he

 That is, the possibility of being made two deputy chief ministers was being expressed
 vahiin nae naamon ko lekar bhi charchaa garm thi
 Names like Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya to Vajubhai Vala were discussed a lot
 2012 main bhi rajya main bijepi ne hi sarkaar banaai thi or 20 disambar ko sarkaar kaa gathan ho gaya tha

 Channi alleged that the minister had taken the claim of their fares more than the cost of their trains
 haalanki, ye sab niyamon ke tahat hi hua he lekin sawaal ye khadaa hota he ki jab niyam bhi khud sarkaar ke banaae hai to phir mantriyon kaa phayda kaise naa ho
 Information was sought from RTI about this, according to the information received from the branch related to the Cabinet Affairs of the General Administration Department of the Government of Topanzab
 mantri jinhone lakhon kamaayen:sikandar singh maluka, mantri, punjab sarkaar–pichley 39 maheenon main apane nijee vaahan ke istemaal ke liye 45 lakh se zyada kaa clem liya
 Gulzar Sinar Ranike - took more than 37 lakh claims in the last 6 months
 surajeet kumaar jyani–pichley 8 maheene main 12 lakh se zyada kaa clem liya
 Surjit Singh Rakhra - Claim of more than 11 lakhs in the last nine months
 janameja singh sekhon–pichley 8 maheenon main 6 lakh se zyada kaa clem liya
 Sohan Singh Chital - Claim of more than 4 lakhs in last three months
 agar in tamaam mantriyon ke nijee vaahan kii everej nikaal lee jaaen to is hisaab se sarkari vaahanon ke istemaal agar kiya jaataa to sarkari rajasav ke kareeb ek karod 17 lakh rupee bachaaye ja sakate the
 At the same time, the ministers named in this RTI also defended themselves, saying that instead of government vehicles, they are using their private vehicles, according to the rules
 vahishkali dal-bijepi sarkaarne apane mantriyon or sarkaar kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki aise hi mantri niyam ke mutabik clem le rahe he joki sarkari gaadi kii bajaae apni privet gaadi kaa istemaal kar rahe hai or mantriyon ko clem kaa ye paisa dene ke dauraan kisi tarah ke bhi niyam kii andekhi nahin kii gai he or naa hi mantriyon ne jarurat se zyada clem lekar sarkari rajasav ko chapat lagaai he or congress jabardastee ise mudda banane main lagi he
 The question here is that even if taxis were hired for ministers, government money could still be saved
 There was a pile up of vehicles due to an accident on the expressway
 Unfortunately the police vehicle before mine & my car also crashed

 They said that Musharraf could not present his case in the case due to being unwell
 unhen paksh rakhane diya jaae
 On this, the Islamabad High Court stopped the court from passing judgment and asked to hear the case from December 5
 vishesh adaalat ne kaha ki vah supreme court ke nirdeshon ko hi maanegi or hoicourt ke nirdesh uske liye myne nahin rakhte
 But with this, the special court, while not giving the verdict, once again ordered Musharraf to record his case on December 5, giving Musharraf a chance to present his case
 ab, isse thik teen din pehle musharraf kii tabiyat achaanak bighad gai he, aise main ek baar phir unke dwaara paksh rakhe jane ke asaar bahut kam lag rahe hai

 baatcheet main gadakari ne apni praathamiktaaon or apni soch ke bare main bataaya
 When asked how he is feeling when he comes to Delhi, he said that the weather of Delhi is frost for him
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ke sabase yuva adhyaksh banane par sabhi ne unka swaagat kiya
 He also said that he had no personal ambition nor did he wish to strengthen his political base by coming to Delhi
 unhone kaha ' main party kaa maamuli kaaryakarta hum or party ke liye jadon se kaam karnaa he
 He also said, 'the Chairman is also part of the system and i will work with everyone
 sabhi log mere saath hanore mujhe takat de rahe hai
 When asked if Rajnath Singh could not succeed because of many people inside the party, will he do the same to him
 is par unhone film 'nayaa daur' kaa gaanaa 'chodo kal kii baaten kal kii baat puraani' sunaate hue kaha ki wo puraani baaten bhoolanaa chaahate hai or nae sire se kaam karnaa chaahate hai
 Gadkari said that the loopholes in the party will be removed
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vikaas par dhyaan dene ke saath hi anushaasan majboot karnaa or aapasi vishwaas kaayam rakhana jaruri he
 He said that he will ensure that the people of the party do not discuss the party's internal things with the media, it is wrong to do so
 gadakari ne kaha ki media main charchaa se party kamjor hoti he isliye aantarik maamalon par party main hi charchaa honi chahie
 On the question of bringing back the leaders who left the party, he said that they will try to connect the leaders leaving the party and for this, the leaders of the state and party will be consulted
 jab unase poocha gaya ki aap aresas se prabhavit hai to unhone kaha ki aresas se zyada abivipi se prabhavit rahe hai
 In response to a question asked by the BJP in Jharkhand to form a government with Shibu Soren, Gadkari said that efforts were on to break up smaller parties in Jharkhand

 In a Dussehra pandal in Patna, lines of concern emerged on the face of a senior leader associated with the bjp's strategy, when those who knew him said, "brother work hard, it seems Lalu ji will come to power
 '' is netaa ke jehan main fouran yah sawaal ghumdie laga ki do charan ke matdaan ke baad hi janata main aisa sandesh kaise chalaa gaya or ab isse kaise nipta jaae?bijepi ke ek varisht ranneetikaar bataate hai, ''pehle charan ke chunaav ke baad mahagathbandhan ne aisa maahaul bana diya ki ladaai ekatarfa ho chuki he, jabaki duusare charan ke baad dashahara kii lambii chuttee ke dauraan nitish-lalu ne pradhanmantri kii raily radd hone ko bevajaah mudda bana diya
 But the party spent the Dussehra celebrations in intensive public relations, and after Vijayadashami, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's three-day rallies tried to energize the workers
 saath hi prachaar kii ranneeti main badlaav kiya
 On the issue of Lalu Prasad Yadav and Jungle Raj in the first two phases, Modi attacked the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar directly on the issue of his meeting with the arrogant Babu and the tantric just before the third phase of voting
 bihar chunaav ko lekar bijepi kaa sheersh netritv kis tarah dabaav main he iskaa andaja is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki vidhansabha ke hisaab se har chote-bade mudde or chunaav ke liye jaruri sansadhano par pradhanmantri modi khud nigaah rakhe hue hai
 However, the statement of Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on the issue of reservation remains a sore throat of BJP in Bihar
 is mudde par lalu kii ore se kii gai us tippanee ke jawaab main ki koi maai kaa laal aarakshan ko nahin hataa saktaa, pradhanmantri ko bhi usee andaaj main jawaab dena padaa ki unke jinda rahete essi-asti aarakshan se koi chhedchhad nahin hone di jaaegi
 The effect of strategic change has started to appear on BJP
 bihar bijepi ke chunaav sah prabharee or kendriya petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan kehete hai, ''tisare or chathe charan kii 105 siton par muqabla ekatarfa he
 The third phase of voting has laid the foundation of power for us and after the fourth phase our government will be formed
 '' bijepi ke rashtriya sachiv shrikant sharma is tippanee main aage jodate hai, ''paanchvaan charan aate-aate mahagathbandhan vipaksh ke netaa kii ladaai ladega
 Although the BJP believes that the strength of the two alliances is between 30 and 35 per cent in terms of social terms, the ebcs can prove to be decisive in this
 isliye party chote-chote pocket ke hisaab se us samaaj ke netaaon ko tarjeeh de rahi he
 The BJP has its own assessment of 24 seats in the 49 seats of the first phase, while it is claiming 16 to 22 seats out of the 32 seats in the second phase
 yani shuruaati do charnon main bijepi khud yah maan rahi he ki nitish-lalu gathbandhan baari padaa he
 But bjp's expectations have taken flight with the third phase polling where 3% more votes have been cast than the Lok Sabha and the region is considered a strong stronghold of the BJP in organizational terms
 tisare charan kii 50 siton main se kam se kam 32 se 35 siten milane kaa party ko anumaan he
 The BJP believes that in the second phase, NDA ally Jitan Ram Manjhi got the benefit and in the third phase, LJP supremo Ram Vilas Paswan

 Parents need to be especially vigilant in view of the increasing crime against children
 jahaan ek ore bacchon ko good tach or bed tach jaisi chije sikhaane kii aavashyaktaa he, vahiin parents apane bacchon ke vyavhaar par bhi najar rakhen
 The incident with the child at Ryan International School in Gurgaon has once again exposed the safety of children in the school
 aise main gangaaraam aspataal kii manovaigyanik dow
 Roma Kumar and Ihabas psychologist Drs
 om prakaash kaa kahana he ki aisi ghatnaon se bacchon main dar paidaa hota he
 This increases the risk of personality disorder
 pradhyumna murder cese: aaropee conductor kaa hoga DNA test, reyaan ke maalikon kii jamaanat kaa hoga virogulekin hamen unhen isi samaaj main rakhana he or jeena sikhaanaa he
 So teach them to fight instead of be afraid and be friendly with them
 yadi bacchon main ye 5 lakshan dikhte hai to use gambhirtha se lete hue bachche se jarur baat karen
 If needed, take them to a psychologist and also talk to the school
 1
 The child is lost and lost: The child who talks very well suddenly starts keeping quiet and if he does not like to talk to anyone, then there is definitely something wrong
 bachche se baatcheet karen, use yah bharosa dilaaein ki aap usase alag nahin hai or kisi bhi haal main aap bachche se naaraaz nahin honge chaahe baat kitni bhi badi kyon naa ho
 2
 choti-choti baat par naaraaz honavyah human sachology he, jisamen vyakti ko gussa tabhi aata he jab vah andar se pareshan hota he
 If your happy child starts crying or angry on every small thing these days, then understand that there is something about which you do not know
 bachche se baat karen or jaanane kii koshish karen
 Talk to the child's school
 ho saktaa he skool main uske saath galat vyavhaar ho rahaa ho
 3
 neend naa aati homebacchon ko neend naa aana is baat ko bahut bada sanket he ki vah andar tak daraa hua he
 Do not take it lightly and visit a psychologist immediately
 bachche ke man se jitani jaldi ho uskaa dar baahar nikaalen
 4
 akele rahanaaapaka baccha achaanak sabase kataa-kataa rahane lage
 It is a matter of concern even if you start living alone
 kyonki bachche aisa tabhi karte hai jab wo andar tak kisi baat se sahame hote hai
 5
 kisi khaas vyakti ko awoid karata habgar aapkaa baccha kisi khaas vyakti ko nazarandaaj karata he to use choti baat naa samajhen or naa hi bachche ko us vyakti se baat karne ko force karen
 By taking the child in confidence, you try to know what is causing the child to ignore the person

 For the people of Kolkata, Thursday is a sweaty day
 lakhon logon ko manzil tak pahunchane vaali kolkata kii pili texiyaan sadakon se nadaarad rahengi
 30,000 taxis of Kolkata have gone on strike demanding a hike
 raftaar se daudti ye pili texiyaan kolkata shahar kii jindagi kaa atoot hissaa hai
 These taxis, which run on the streets of the city's street or small and big roads, reach millions of people everyday
 raat chadhane ke baad jab kolkata shahar ke log gahari neend main so jate hai, tab bhi ye texiyaan sadakon par bhaagti najar aati hai, shahar ko jagaakar rakhti hai
 But from 6 o'clock on Thursday morning, neither these taxis are taking people to the floor nor are they moving with the speed of the city
 subah 6 baje se kolkata kii 30 hajaar texiyaan jahaan hai vahiin bejaan hokar khadi hai or shuukravaar subah 6 baje tak inkaa jagah se hilne kaa bhi koi iraadaa nahin he
 Due to the taxis strike, the people of Kolkata have started to sweat
 ghar, daftar, airport, railway stesan, aspataal yaa kisi bhi jagah kaise pahunche, iskaa koi rasta inhe nahin sujh rahaa
 Trouble will increase when people get out of the house as the day progresses and try to reach their destination
 kolkata kii taxi associations do maheene se kiraaya badhaane kii maang kar rahi hai
 The state transport minister has also been talked to, but when there was no hearing on the demand, the taxi drivers went on strike
 taxi unionon ne sarkaar ko ultimatum diya he ki taxi kiraye main tatkaal badhotaree ho, police kii julm jyaadati band ho, haadase main maut par murder charge na lage, haadase main maut par jamaanti dharaaen lage, texiyon par vigyaapan kii ijaajat mili, raat main 20 fisadi sarcharge kaa praavdhaan ho

 There are only three months left for such a big event, but the preparations made by corruption, negligence and mismanagement are a witness that no major event in this country can be completed without taking the scandal
 asal main har 12 saal baad elahabaad main hone vaale mahakumbh kii taiyaariyon ko is baar do charnon main baanta gaya he
 In the first phase, the city of Allahabad is to be beautified, while in the second phase, the preparations for the fair site around the confluence have to be completed
 yah taiyaari tab shuru hogi jab barish ke baad ganga-yamuna kaa jalastr kam hoga
 In such a situation, the preparations for the second phase will start within the next 15 days, but the preparations for the first phase are not showing as much on paper as they are in reality

 Got a budget of march-april ke maheene main sadakon ko chaida karne, unke bich divyder banane or chairahon ko nayaa rup dene kii kavayad shuru hui
 It is here that the confluence of administrative mismanagement and corruption also began to appear
 sabase pehle to sadakon ko chaudaa kiye bagaiyr shahar ke 18 chairahon par kaam shuru hua
 The public was harmed by these actions and when the administrative authorities did not listen to it, the matter went to the Allahabad High Court and the court put a halt to the construction and beautification of the facades with immediate effect

 In such a situation, Ganga will need at least 5,000 cusecs of additional water
 iske liye sarkaar ko abhi se prayaas karnaa chahie
 Keeping in mind the difficulties of devotees, the administration planned to construct a total of eight ghats along the banks of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers and for this, Rs 30 crore
 kaa bajet tay kiya gaya he
 The administration had proposed the construction of three ghats along the banks of the Ganges, but the fact was also revealed that the course of the Ganges keeps changing, so there is no justification for constructing a ghat along it
 yahi nahin, elahabaad kaa kila or yamuna nadi ke kinare ke bich 100 meter se bhi kam jagah he
 At this place too, when preparations were made to build a dam, the army and archeology department, which was looking after the fort, also objected because this ghat was coming within the prescribed range of the army and archeology department
 ab keval yamuna nadi par hi boat club, balua tat, arahal tat or takaraha tat par hi ghaaton kaa nirmaan karaayaa ja rahaa he lekin sust kaam ke chalate inke kumbh tak taiyaar hone kii sambhaavna na ke baraabar he

 upmukhyamantri susheel modi shanivaar ko argedy supremeo lalu prasad or unke parivaar ke khilaaf puure aakraamak mood main dikhe
 At first, Modi lashed out at Lalu at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Union Conference, saying that the entry of corrupt people into the country's legislature has resulted, which is the result that today the three former chief ministers of the country are in jail
 rashtramandal sansadeey sangh sammelan kii samaapti ke baad susheel modi ne bihar ke purv mukhyamantri jananaayak karpuri thakur kii punyatithi kaarykram ko sambodhit kiya
 During this time, he targeted the Lalu family and said that when the people giving the blessings of Karpoori Thakur got an opportunity, they took advantage of that opportunity by making a lot of wealth
 modi ne kaha ki 50 varshon tak raajnneeti main sakriy rahane vaale karpuri thakur kii jab mrityu hui to unke paas ek pakkaa makaan or koi bank balance nahin tha
 But there are people who cite his name, who got the opportunity to become owner of more than 30 benami property at the age of 28
 modi kaa yah ishaara argedy netaa tejasvi yadav kii ore tha
 Modi said that he made a comment at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Union Conference that three Chief Ministers are eating jail air because of the entry of corrupt people in the legislature
 is tippanee ke baad argedy ke vidhayakon ne kaarykram ke dauraan jo hangaamaa machaaya usase 'chor kii dadhi main tinkaa' kahawat charitaarth hota he
 Modi asked the RJD mlas who created a ruckus during the program that they should tell if their leaders have been jailed in the Lalu Prasad movement or the Satyagraha fight or they have been sentenced by 3 courts on charges of corruption like fodder scam, due to which He is eating the air of jail? RJD mlas who have accused Sushil Modi that Commonwealth Parliamentary Union Conference like International He used the Central Conference to do his politics and tarnished the dignity of Bihar, in response to which Modi said that Bihar was actually defamed and tarnished by those who looted the treasury of Bihar and kept Bihar in darkness for 15 years Committed the sin of pushing modi ne kaha ki lalu jaise sajayaftaa ke samarthan main unke vidhayakon ne antarrashtriya sammelan main jo hangaamaa kiya usase bihar kii chhavi ko ek baar phir daagdar kiya gaya he
 He said that the people of the state will not forgive those who shame Bihar again
 haryana police ne dilli se sate faridabad main bihar ke ek property dealer kii hatya kii gutthi sulajhaa lee he
 According to the police, they have arrested two accused in this murder case, though around 6 accused including the main accused are still absconding
 police ne kaha ki faraar aropiyon ko bhi jald hi giraftaar kar liya jayega
 Police are the same killers who killed a property dealer in Patna and escaped by throwing the body into the jungles of Surajkund Pali Road
 faridabad krime branch ne in aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Significantly, on the night of 29 November, Pravin Vishwakarma, a resident of Patna, was called to Faridabad on the pretext of paying the payment
 aropiyon ne bahaane se faridabad bulaakar bihar ke property dealer praveen ko goli markar jangal main adhamari avasthaa main phenk diya tha
 Police said that about 1 of the deceased Praveen's main conspirators, Varun Kumar
 5 karod rupye bakaayaa tha
 On the pretext of returning the same amount, Varun called Praveen from Patna to Faridabad
 usne baqayada praveen ko dilli kaa air tikat bhi bheja tha
 When Praveen reached Varun in Faridabad, Varun beat Praveen Kumar first with the help of his two bouncers and then took him to the hills along the Surajkund Pali road in Faridabad
 vahaan unhone praveen ko goli maar di
 He left Praveen as dead in the forest
 police abhi hatya ke mastermind varun sahit 6 aropiyon ko giraftaar nahin kar pai he
 But the most surprising thing would be seeing the accused in police custody laughing
 police hiraasat main aropiyon kaa jo video saamne aayaa he, usamenaropee hansate huenjar aa rahe hai
 The police are also seen laughing with him
 bataate chalem ki is maamle main faridabad police par laaparvaahee baratane ke bhi aarope lage the
 Praveen called the police and one of his friends in Patna in an injured state after being shot and requested to be saved
 lekin faridabad police kii taraf se use koi madad nahin mili thi
 Ranjit Kumar, the brother-in-law of the deceased, had alleged that Pravin Kijan could have been saved if the police had got help in time
 mritak ke parijanon ne bhi aarope lagaaya tha ki faridabad pahunchane ke baad ve faridabad police ko jangal kii lokation bataate rahe, lekin police unhen 6 ghante tak bargalaati rahi
 Now this kind of laughing of the accused in police custody and accompanying the policemen in laughing at them, is exposing their negligence
 police do aropiyon ko giraftaar kar bhale apni peeth thapthapa rahi ho, lekin sachai yah he ki ab tak police mukhya sajeeshkarta varun ko giraftaar nahin kar pai he

 (input bhashaa samachar agency se bhi) (also from input language news agency) hamamen se zyaadaatar logon ke ghar main har roj daal-chaaval banataa hoga
 In some people's home, this is the main meal of the afternoon, while in some houses it is the night
 par daal-chaaval ek aisi cheez he jise ham roj kha sakate hai or wo bhi bina bor hue
 There are many reasons to like lentils and rice
 pehali to iskaa swaad
 Plain and sweet
 daal-chaaval ko pasand kiye jane kii duusari or sabase badi vajah ye he ki ye jhatpat taiyaar ho jaataa he
 There are some foods that only a certain class likes, but lentils and rice is something that every class eats with fervor
 daal main bharpoor maatra main protein, fibre or colstrol hota he or chaaval carbohydrate se bharpoor
 In this case, it is a healthy diet
 daal-chaaval khaane ke phaayde :1
 Lentils contain many amino acids that are not present in rice
 aise main jab aap daal or chaaval saath khate hai to aapako ye saare poshak tatv mil jate hai
 2
 daal or chaaval donon main hi fibre kii bharpoor maatra hoti he
 This is a digestible dish
 fibre kii maujugi se pachan kriya behatar banati he
 If you use brown rice instead of white rice, it is even more beneficial
 brown rice main selenium, mangneej, copper, phosphorus or magnesium jaise aavashyak lavan paae jate hai
 3
 maansaahaar karne waalon main protein kii kami nahin hone paati lekin shaakaahaari logon ke liye daal hi protein kaa pramukh madhyam he
 It is also helpful in keeping the folate present in it safe
 4
 It is believed that eating rice will increase weight
 par aisa nahin he
 Eating lentils and rice makes you feel full for a long time
 jisase dinabhar kuch-kuch khaane kii jarurat nahin padati or extra calories jamaa nahin hone paati he
