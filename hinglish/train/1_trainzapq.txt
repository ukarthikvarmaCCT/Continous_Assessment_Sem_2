 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday termed the announcement by the Central Railway Minister and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad of blaming the state governments including the Center for the rising inflation in the country and agitation by them

 He said that the elder brother's eyes are fixed on the Chief Minister's residence on one Anne Road but this time also he is not going to get anything
 desh main pehali baar koi mahila vitt mantri bajet pesh karne ja rahi hai
 Earlier, Indira Gandhi also presented the budget in 1970, but she was the acting Finance Minister
 nai vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman 5 july ko modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal kaa pehla bajet pesh karengi
 There is a lot of enthusiasm and expectations among women about the budget presented by a woman finance minister

 mahila evam bal vikaas mantralay kaa aavanton 20 fisadi badhaakar 29,000 karod rupee kar diya gaya tha
 The allocation for Pradhan Mantri Matri Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) has been doubled from Rs 1200 crore to Rs 2,500 crore
 bajet pesh karte hue kendriya mantri piyush goyal ne kaha tha ki pradhanmantri mudra yojana kii 70 fisadi labhaarthi mahilaayein hai
 What the Finance Minister can do In the year 2018, the Economic Survey came out with a pink cover, which is seen as our policy-makers being gender sensitive
 pichley saal ke bajet main mahilaon ke liye kai or kai mad main aavanton badaye gaye to kuch main katautee bhi kii gai
 Allotment of women schemes increased by 4% to 1%
 21 lakh karod rupee tak kar diya tha
 So this time people have high hopes from the women finance minister
 inakam tex main chhot kaa praavdhanpichley saal ke bajet main tatkaaleen vitt mantri arun jetali ne ek acchhee pahal yah kii thi ki pehle teen saal main mahila karmchaaree ke ipief yogadan ko 12 se ghataakar 8 fisadi kar diya gaya
 The government pays this four per cent difference
 isko aage bhi jari rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, there has been a demand of women for a long time that the income tax exemption limit given to them under 80C should be increased
 ho saktaa he ki is baar vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman is par gaur karen
 It is also being demanded that tax exemption should be given to the amount spent on children's care facility by women in crash centers etc
 ujjwala or anya yojanaon kaa dayera badhemodi sarkaar kii ujjwala yojana desh main kaaphi safal or lokapriy rahi he
 The biggest benefit of this scheme has been to the poor women, who have got freedom from the stove smoke
 modi sarkaar ke duusari satta main aane main is yojana kaa bhi ek bada yogadan he
 Under the Prime Minister Ujjwala scheme, the government has set a target of giving 8 crore gas connections
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki isamen vitt mantri or kya nayaa kar sakati hai
 How can its scope be extended? is yojana kii ek shikaayat yah aati he ki garibon ko silinder riffil karaane main samasya aati he
 Maybe the Finance Minister will make an announcement for this
 isi tarah pradhanmantri matra vandana yojana kaaphi lokapriy hui he
 Under this, the government gives 6 thousand rupees to pregnant and lactating women
 iske liye aavanton badhaayaa gaya he, lekin is rakam main bhi kuch badhat karne kii ummid kii ja rahi he
 Increase allocation for women safety Women security is an area that no one can think of better than a woman finance minister
 mahila suraksha ke liye public place or transport main sisitivi camere lagane, mahila police bal badhaane ke liye ghoshnaaen kii ja sakati hai
 Allocation in the ongoing schemes for women safety will have to be increased
 udhyamita ko badhawabhaarat main mahilaayein ab zyada se zyada udhyamita ke kshetra main aa rahi hai
 According to a survey, 48 percent of India's housewives want to start their own business or become financially independent
 sarkaar mahilaon ke liye ‘saport tu training and employament program (STEP)’ chalaati he, lekin iske liye bajtary elakeshan sirf 5 karod rupee kaa he jise badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, there is a need to encourage women-friendly policies in the industry, in the corporate world, so that more and more women are included in the workforce

 Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal is scheduled to hold the second investment summit Invest Punjab 2015 on October 28-29, in which he plans to project the state as the country's top investment destination
 iske thik pehle sitambar kii shuruyaat main 'kaarobaar lagane main aasaani' par vishwa bank kii ore se kii gai bhartiya rajyon kii reating main punjab ne sheersh jagah hasil kar lee
 This is perhaps an early indication of the changing environment in the state, where the existing industries have been struggling to survive for the last decade
 centre sarkaar ne 1995 main us vakt prachlit fret ikvalijeshan skim yani maldhulaai ko baraabar karne kii yojana waapas le lee thi
 This scheme used to compensate the freight expenses for bringing raw materials from the source areas and ports to the industrial producers of Punjab

 Locks hit twenty steel units and thousands of related industries
 inamen cycle nirmaan, yarn or hojri ikaiyaan bhi thim, jinhone ludhiana ko 'bharat ke manchester' kaa khitaab dilvaaya tha
 The state's second setback came in 2003, when the NDA government gave a 10-year tax holiday to new industrial units in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, but kept Punjab out of it
 factriyon ke maalik rah chuke, khaskar choti or madhyam ikaiyaan chalaane vaale log kehete hai ki unhen behatar gunvattta vaale utpaada banane or dene main jo thodi-bahut badhat hasil thi, vah bhi ek ke baad ek rajya sarkaron ke thope gaye bijli ke oonche daamon or wet kii oonchi daron kii badaulat puri tarah jaati rahi
 Due to continuous lack of electricity and lack of favorable industrial policy in the state, the problem was completed

 At the same time, in the last phase of his second term, Badal is claiming that he is now 'ready to do business'
 2007 main jab unki party gaddinshin hui thi, tab badal ke mutabik, ''hamaare paas dene ko zyada kuch nahin tha
 "there was a time when summer power cuts were common in the state
 mote taur par isaki vajah thi naakaafi bijli utpaadan or behad asantulit khapatah sardiyon main 3,500 megawatt or dhur garmiyon main 10,500 megawatt
 In contrast, today Punjab has the capacity to generate 11,666 MW
 yani saal ke aath maheene ke liye 5,000 megawatt se zyada atirikt bijli uplabdh he
 In fact, 'assured supply of electricity anywhere in the state' was at the top of the box that Badal opened for new investors

 Two years ago, Badal took a step that could not be exemplified anywhere in the country, he handed over rights to Tiwari for sanctioning of 23 different departments

 Tiwari claims that the average time taken to get regulatory clearances to start construction is now 38 working days

 Of these 117 in principle approvals, 11 projects are ready to start commercial production, 55 are in different stages of construction and 109 are about to begin construction

 But now the growing population of industrial workers is a big attraction for potential investors

 Despite what Tiwari calls the 'era of despair' in the global investment environment, there has been a steady flow of new investment in Punjab

 The state is also offering 7 to 13 years exemption on VAT, 50 to 100 per cent exemption on electricity tariff, exemption from stamp duty on land and property tax exemption in urban areas
 badal kehete hai, ''ham punjab ko duusare rajyon se kai darje upar sthapit karnaa chaahate hai
 In this direction, the Deputy Chief Minister is promising unmatched connectivity thanks to the new Expressway, the new Chandigarh International Airport and Mukesh Ambani's Reliance and Airtel's 4G telecom network
 ve kehete hai, ''28 disambar tak har gaanv 4ji se judaa hoga
 "to develop a positive ecosystem," says Tiwari, the state government is already negotiating with the owners of the ill-fated bicycle industry, textile units and foundries in Ludhiana

 In a very short time, Patanjali has achieved such success as a company that very few companies have luck
 patanjali kii safalataa kaa alam yah he ki aaj na sirf videshi balki bhartiya companiyon ke bhi paseene chhot gaye hai
 In the words of Baba Ramdev, 'we reached Patanjali's Swadeshi campaign to 5000 crores and have set a target of more than 10,000 crores next year
 yani ek saal main hamaara lakshya 150 fisadi tak bijness ko badhanaa he
 'really starting from a very low level, giving a big competition to the companies already present in the market, that too without any famous face, will be considered a big success in business
 beshak yah safar aasaan nahin tha or ab jab baba ne ise paa hi liya he to jaane kiisse duusari companiyaan kya 5 khaas sabak sikh sakati hai -1
 Understanding of business and catching up on work The success of any business depends on the correct knowledge of the work
 aap ek safal bijnesaman tabhi ban sakate hai jab aapaki apane kaam ke upar puri pakad hogi
 The biggest reason behind the success of Patanjali is that Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev has complete knowledge of Ayurveda including Yoga

 Baba Ramdev should get complete numbers for his correct timing
 jab desh bhar main megi ke sample fail ho rahe the or us par bain lag gaya tab baba ramdev ne patanjali noodles bazaar main utaar die

 graahakon kii samajhakisi bhi bijness ke liye graahakon kii samaj hona behad jaruri he
 a businessman should know who his customers are and what they want? Are they getting what they expect from you? Baba Ramdev recognizes the pulse of the people
 wo vahi kehete hai jo log sunanaa chaahate hai
 They often keep saying things like, Swadeshi, Satyagraha and foreign companies are looting our country
 in baton ko asar bhi hota he or log sidhe unase jud jate hai

 acha lekin sasta samaanakam keemat main agar acchhee cheez mili to graahak khinche chale aate hai
 It is the same with Patanjali's products
 ramdev apane vigyapanon main duusari company ke products or apane products kii keemat kii tulana karte rahete hai
 He has explained to people in a very simple way that the honey of such and such company is expensive and their honey is cheap
 yahi vajah he ki aaj patanjali ke products ghar-ghar kii jarurat ban gaye hai

 koi brands ambesder nahin, naam hi kaaphi haiaamtaur par sabhi companiyaan product kii ghar-ghar tak pahchaan banane ke liye ek parichit sitare ko product kaa ambesder bana detii hai
 The company also invests a hefty amount in making a brand ambassador
 yah formula hit bhi he
 But Baba Ramdev went beyond this, focusing on the quality of his product by bringing it in a native avatar

 In Hindi literature, the writer whose name comes to mind after Munshi Premchand is Phaniswaranath Renu
 vah bhartiya janamanas ke ek adbhut chitere the
 His compositions were like vignettes
 isiilie renu ko bhartiya sahitya jagat main ek behad sammanit sthaan hasil he
 Today is Renu's death anniversary
 fanishwarnath renu kaa janm 4 march, 1921 ko bihar ke arriya jile ke forbisganj ke nikat auraahi hingna gram main hua tha
 At that time it was a part of Purnia district
 renu ji kii praarambhik shiksha forbisganj tathaa arriya main hui
 He then moved to Nepal
 vahaan koirala parivaar ke saath rahakar viratnagar ke viratnagar adarsh vidhyalay se metric kii pariksha paas kii
 Later he passed the intermediate examination from a school attached to Kashi Hindu University and in 1942, he jumped into freedom struggle at the call of Gandhiji
 bharat-chodo andolan main renu kii shirkat ne unamem siyasat kii samaj jagaai
 During this time he joined the Socialist Party and took active participation in politics
 kaha jaataa he ki vah saal 1950 main nepal kii damankaaree ransatta ke viruddh sashastr kranti ke sutaradhar the, jiske parinamswarup nepal main janatantr kii sthapana hui
 Both literature and politics continued together in Renu's life
 renu ji ne aaajeevan shoshan or daman ke viruddh sangharsh kiya
 Phaniswarnath Renu started story writing from around 1936
 us samay unki kuch kahaniyaan prakashit bhi huin, kintu ve kishor renu kii aparipakv kahaniyaan thim
 When he was freed from prison in 1944 after being arrested in the 1942 movement, on returning home, he wrote the first mature story called 'batbaba'
 'batbaba' 'saptahik vishwamitra' ke 27 agast, 1944 ke ank main prakashit hui, renu kii duusari kahani 'pahalwaan kii dholak' 11 disambar, 1944 ko 'saptahik vishwamitra' main hi chhapi thi
 In 1954, his magnum opus 'maila Aanchal' was published
 renu ko jitani khyaati apane upanyaas 'mailaa anchal' se mili, uski misaal hindi sahitya main milanaa durlabh he
 The publication of this novel established him overnight as a major Hindi storyteller
 kuch aalochakon ne ise 'godaan' ke baad ise hindi kaa doosraa sarvshereshth upanyaas qaraar diya
 However, 'maila Aanchal' did not make the controversy any less
 renu se jalane waalon ne ise satinath bhaduree ke bangala upanyaas 'dhodhai charit maanas' kii nakal bataaya, par 'parati pariktha' ke shilp ne yah sthapit kar diya kii renu kya hai? samay ke saath is tarah ke jhuthe aarope samaapt ho gaye
 In 1972 Renu wrote his final story 'graffiti's Mayuri'
 unki ab tak uplabdh kahaniyon kii sankhya 63 he
 The more fame Renu got from novels, the more fame he got from his stories
 'thumari', 'aginkhor', 'aadim raatri kii mahak', 'ek shrawani dopahari kii dhoop', 'achche aadmi', 'sampoorn kahaniyaan', aadi unke prasiddh kahani sangrah hai
 What to say about 'killed Gulfam' aka third oath? Apart from fiction, Renu also wrote memoirs, sketches and reports in other genres
 unki charchit rachanaaon main - 'mailaa anchal', 'parati pariktha', 'julus', 'dirghatapa', 'kitne chauraahey', 'palatu babu road'; katha-sangrah- 'ek aadim raatri kii mahak', 'thumari', 'agnikhor', 'achche aadmi', reportaj- 'rinjal-dhanjal', 'nepali krantiktha', 'vantulsi kii gandh', 'shrut ashrut purv' aadi shaamil hai
 'on the rock of time', 'self introduction' are his memoirs
 iske atirikt renu ji 'dinmaan patrika' main reportaj bhi likhte the
 'nepali Kranti Katha' is a good example of his report
 jin kahaniyon ne shoharat ke kirtiman banaae unamem 'maare gayi gulfam' urf teesri kasam', 'ek aadim raatri kii mahak', 'laal paan kii begum', 'panchalite', 'tabe ekala chalo re', 'thes', 'sanvadiya' aadi shaamil hai
 The specialty of Renu's work was that her style of writing was descriptive
 isiilie inke kathankon ke paatr or prishthbhumi donon chalchitr kaa sa prabhaav chhodte
 In his compositions, the picture of regionalism was drawn in such a way that you can imagine it without going to that zone
 inaki lagbhag har kahani main paatro kii soch ghatnaon se pradhan hoti thi
 Renu ji took active participation in Jayaprakash Narayan movement and renounced Padma Shri in protest against the repression by the power
 renuji ne hindi main aanchalik katha kaa vistaar kiya, jisaki neenv munshi premchand ne rakhi thi
 Apart from the friendship of established creators like Sachchidananda Hiranand Vatsyayan 'agyeya', he was a budding photopatrapar of Patna at that time
 atibal ke bhi mithravat the
 This unique figure of regionalism in Hindi literature breathed its last on 11 April 1977 in Patna

 ayodhya masaleko sulajhane kii ek baar or koshish ho rahi he
 Both sides have come forward with a new formula to resolve this issue disputed for 65 years
 baaki baton ke alaava is formule kii ek badi shart ye he kiviechapi yani vishwa hindu parishadko isse dur rakhaa ja rahaa he
 Is VHP the bone of the neck? Mahant Gyan Das and Hashim Ansari are trying to resolve the Ayodhya issue through negotiations for years
 mahant gyaan das akhaada parishad ke adhyaksh hai or hashim ansaari musalamaanon kii taraf se sabase bujurg vaadi hai
 In this case, the Nirmohi Akhara, which comes under the Akhara Parishad, is the plaintiff of Hindus
 in donon ne mil kar tay kiya he ki puri baatcheet main vishwa hindu parishad ko shaamil nahin kiya jayega
 According to Mahant Gyandas, the solution of the Ayodhya issue was found out only a few days after the High Court's decision
 hashim ansaari ke saath baatcheet ke baad is maamle se jude sabhi pakshon ke bich sahmati bhi bana lee gai thi
 The draft of the agreement was about to be signed, but it did not happen at the last moment
 mahant gyaan das kaa kahana he ki viechpi ke log hi nahin chaahate ki is masale kaa hal nikle kyonki unhen lagata he ki agar aisa hua to unki to dukaan hi band ho jaaegi
 High Court's decision? On 30 September 2010, the Allahabad High Court gave the verdict, dividing the disputed land into three parts
 court ne kaha ki jahaan ramalala virajman hai wo jameen or uske aasapaas kii jameen ram mandir ko di jaae
 The remaining one-third of the land should be given to the Sunni Waqf Board and one-third to the Nirmohi Arena
 samjhaute kii manzil aakhir kitni dur?hoicourt ke faisle se do hafte pehle samasya kaa shantipurna samaadhaan nikaalane kii ek or koshish hui thi
 On 18 March 2010, a five-member committee was formed on the initiative of retired Allahabad High Court Judge Palok Basu
 faisle ke baad mahant gyaan das or hashim ansaari ne apane tareeke se puri koshish kii
 Efforts are on for agreement
 prayasarat rahane se taatkaalik taur par or kuch bhale ho yaa nahin, ye manzil kii raah se bhatakane se bachaata to he hi
 There are two important things in the new formula
 ek - viechpi ko dur rakhaa jaae, taaki samjhaute kii maujuuda koshish main phir koi roda na khadaa ho
 Secondly, the proposed temple and mosque in the agreement should be divided by a 100 feet high wall, so that there is no scope for future situations of dispute
 mahant gyaan das kaa stand bilkul saaf he
 He says, "we are not in favor of anything that would make our Muslim brothers feel that they are losers
" "das aage kehete hai, "ham viechpi or bijepi ke is rukh kii kadi ninda karte hai ki masjid ko ayodhya kii panchakoshi parikrama kii seemaa ke baahar banaaya jaae
 We do not care for a handful of VHP leaders
 hamen sirf desh ke logon kii parvaah he
 "there is a fundamental difference between fresh and old efforts

 The Indian hockey team, which defeated arch-rivals Pakistan in the first match, could neither maintain the momentum on Tuesday nor did they take advantage of the match, which Australia beat them 5-2 to register their first win in the 12th World Cup
 pehle match main 4-1 se jeet ke nayak rahe draig flikar sandip singh puri tarah kharaab farm main dikhe jabaki deepak thakur or prabhjot singh jaise anbhavi farward khilaadiyon ne bhi niraash kiya
 India were badly missed by striker Shivendra Singh, who is facing a two-match suspension

 For Australia, Day Young Liam (second minute), Glenn Turner (eighth and 43rd minute), Desmond Abbott (26th) and Laik Dorner (41st minute) scored goals while for India, Vikram Pillai (35th minute) and captain Rajpal Singh ( 53rd) scored goals
 pehle match main england ke haathon apratyaashit paraajay jhelane ke baad austrailian team ne vajood banaaye rakhane ke is mukaable main bharat ko har vibhaag main bouna sabit kar diya
 Indians had no answer to their stamina and speed
 pehle match main vijetaon ke tevar lekar khilne vaali bhartiya team thakee maadi najar ai
 In the second minute, pressure from the Australian goal dominated the Indians till the end
 austrailia ko saatven or aathven minute main lagaataar do penlti carnor mili
 Indian goalkeeper Adrian d'souza saved the goal on the first but Glenn Turner doubled the team's lead with a rebound shot on the second
 austrailia ne 13wein minute main ek or penlti carnor banaaya lekin gol nahin kar sake
 Three minutes later, d'souza saved an excellent move by the Australian strikers from finishing
 bharat ko pehla penlti carnor 22wein minute main mila lekin pakistan ke khilaaf do gol daagne vaale draig flikar sandip singh is baar naakaam rahe
 Meanwhile, in the 26th minute, the Australian forward line once again made a big dent in the Indian defense and scored the third goal
 grant shubart ne rabart hamand ko cross diya jinase gend lekar desmund eboat ne gol daaga
 After losing three goals, the Indians made frequent attacks in the last two minutes
 iskaa fal bhi 34wein minute main ek or penlti carnor ke rup main mila lekin austrailian khilaadiyon ke video refral lene ke baad ampire ne ise amaanya qaraar diya
 Vikram Pillai opened the account for India in the 35th minute
 austrailian dephendaron se gend chhinte hue ajarun halppa ne unhen cross diya jis par dahini ore se unhone gend gol ke bheetar daalkar pehle half main bhartiya prashansakon ko khush hone kaa ekmaatr mauka diya
 The condition and direction of the Indian players could not change in the second half as well
 austrailia ne phir do minute ke bheetar do penlti carnor gol main badalakar badhat 5-1 kii kar lee
 First Dorner and then Turner scored
 bharat ko 52wein minute main penlti carnor mila jise sandip gol main nahin badal sake
 But the Indians did not lose control of the ball and once again, Halappa, playing his role as a playmaker, gave Rajpal a cross that did not miss a goal
 austrailia or antar se jeetta lekin disuja ne behtareen golkiping kaa namoona pesh karte hue 54wein minute main penlti carnor or 65wein minute main penlti stroke par gol bachaaya

 gauratlab he ki voting ke dauraan satish chandra mishra ne ye bhi shikaayat di thi ki kai matdaan kendron par basapa ke votaron ko vishesh rup se daliton vot dene se roka ja rahaa he or ye kaam police or prashasan dwaara kiya ja rahaa he
 In this regard, Satish Chandra Mishra also lodged a complaint over phone to DGP OP Singh that the UP police was creating an atmosphere of fear in the Dalit dominated areas, so that the Dalit voters should be reduced, this will not be tolerated
 satish mishra ne dijipi opi singh se kaha tha ki sthiti nahin sudhari to ve chunaav ayog main shikaayat karenge
 SC Mishra, BSP: We've registered another complaint with the Election Commission & have sent them a video clip of EVM, in which it is seen that 'elephant' symbol is being pressed but vote is going to bjp's 'lotus' symbol

 unhone twit karte hue likhaa ki, dalit bhaaiyon va bahanon ko vot daalane se rokna jurm he or paap donon he, kyonki matdaan har naagarik kaa buniyadi adhikaar he
 He wrote that sin is because only voting erases all differences between people for a day
 saath hi likhaa ki ab bhaajapa ke netaa khulkar kah rahe hai ki yah desh sabakaa nahin he or logon main nafrat failaa rahe hai
 SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said that voting was held today in eight seats of West UP - Gautam Buddha Nagar, Ghaziabad, Baghpat, Meerut, Kairana, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur and Bijnor seats

 The newly appointed Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Arjun Singh, had chosen the Kharsia assembly constituency in Raigad district, now in Chhattisgarh, to enter the House through a by-election
 upachunaav ko dhyaan main rakhte hue arjuna singh ne chhindwara jile ke jan swasthya, ejineering, sinchai or lok nirmaan vibhaag ke adhikariyon ko chunakar unka tabadalaa kharsia kar diya tha taaki upachunaav se pehle vahaan rukii padi sabhi pariyojnaon kaa kaam fatafat puraa kara diya jaae
 Arjun Singh knew that at that time Kamal Nath, a two-time MP from Chhindwara, had appointed the best officers of the state in his constituency
 arjuna singh ne us upachunaav main bhaajapa ke ummidavaar dilip judev ko haraa diya
 Now let's return to 2018-19
 pradesh ke navaniyukt mukhyamantri ke saamne behtareen adhikariyon kii team kii pahchaan karne kii chunauti he
 For the first time, Kamal Nath, who has entered the politics of the state, has a tough challenge not only to give good administration to fulfill the party's big promises but also to make the Congress party successful in the Lok Sabha elections
 chunautiyaan kis tarah kii hai or kamalnath unka saamana kaise kar rahe hai?pehali chunauti to raajnneetik kathinaaiyon kii he
 The government has a very modest majority in the 230-member assembly with 121 mlas, including the support of two BSP and one SP MLA, along with only 114 mlas and four mlas who won the election as an independent candidate rebel against the Congress
 gwalior kshetra se bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) sarkaar ke ek purv mantri nirdaleey vidhayakon or congress ke kuch vidhayakon se sampark banaakar unhen istipha dene ke liye raji karne kii koshish main hai taaki unki siten khaali hone par vahaan dobaaraa upachunaav karaae jaaen
 The BJP hopes that when this happens, the party can win the by-elections and reach the majority mark
 haalanki congress ke kendriya netritv ko lagata he ki kamalnath aise vyakti hai jo maamuli bahumat ke baavjood sarkaar chalaane kii kshamta rakhte hai, phir bhi mukhyamantri ko har vakt vidhayakon kii sankhya ko lekar chaukanna rahanaa hoga, khaskar vidhansabha satron ke dauraan, jab bhaajapa apane 109 vidhayakon ke saath ek taqatvar vipaksh ke rup main saamne khadi hogi
 The formation of a cabinet and allocation of ministries has proved to be a difficult task as it took more time than usual to talk to the legislators regarding the allocation of ministries
 haalanki yah kaam ab puraa ho gaya he lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki sab kuch thik-thaak ho chukaa he
 As Chief Minister, Kamal Nath will work with such ministers, whose decision to give him a place in the cabinet is not his alone
 bhaajapa ke paas rajya kii 29 loksabhaa siton main se 26 siten hai
 In 2019, Congress plans to reduce this number to the maximum and win at least 15 seats for itself
 vidhansabha chunaavon main bhaajapa ne jis tarah se congress ko kadi takkar di thi, use dekhte hue yah kaam aasaan nahin hoga
 But the Chief Minister has already started working on this
 ve loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye sambhavit ummidavaaron se baatcheet shuru kar chuke hai or anarakshit siton par zyada se zyada obisi (anya pichhadaa varg) ummidavaar khadaa karnaa chaahate hai
 How serious Kamal Nath is about the planning of the Lok Sabha elections can be gauged from the fact that the probable people who donated the party were not pressurized beyond the limit in the assembly elections because the leadership of the party believed that the Lok Sabha These people will be needed again to face the bjp's power in elections
 iske alaava, rajya kii raajnneeti main yah kamalnath kaa pehla kaarykaal he
 He has a lot of experience as a Union Minister but there is a lot of difference between running a ministry at the Center and running a government in the state
 ek varisht prashasnic adhikari kehete hai, ''centre ke str par mantri ke paas kaam karne ke liye sachiv or sanyukt sachivon kii puri jamaat hoti he lekin rajya ke str par vibhageeya sachiv se neeche kaa str utana sakasham nahin hota jaisaa ki centre main hota he
 "apart from this, there is a whole army of district collectors and babus in the state capital, whose work needs to be monitored at all times
 kendriya mantri ke taur par kamalnath ko parinaam dene vaale vyakti ke rup main janaa jaataa tha jo naukarshahon se kaam lenaa jaanate the
 Officials in Bhopal seem happy that now they will rule because the rest have no experience of running the government except the Chief Minister and 8 ministers in 28
 isliye mukhyamantri ko tamaam mantralayon par kareeb se najar rakhni hogi, bhale hi ve yah ghoshnaa kar chuke hai ki sabhi mantri apane-apane vibhaagon ke kaamkaaj ke prati puri tarah javabdeh honge
 Another reason for the bureaucracy to be happy is that Kamal Nath has not tried to make any major changes through transfers and appointments
 keval unheen colectoron ko badla gaya he jinhen party netaaon kii feedback ke mutabik, chunaavon ke dauraan congress ke ummidavaaron ke prati durbhaavna se kaam karte hue paaya gaya tha
 Another administrative officer, who has worked with Kamal Nath earlier, says, "the state of affairs often has to pay attention to the very specifics of things, while the center does not
 kamalnath bahut baarikiyon main nahin jate hai, lekin unhen yahaan apana tarika jaldi hi badalanaa hoga
 However, the Chief Minister takes information very subtly in interaction with people
 ek prashasnic adhikari unke karyaalay main jab unase milane gaya to yah dekhakar chakit rah gaya ki ve agxcutive record (iaar) shit ke saath baithe hue the
 This sheet contains a complete list of officers' appointments
 ve kisi siio kii tarah sambhavit adhikari se poochhate hai, ''to aapaki vishesh yogyata kya he or aap uskaa istemaal kahaan kar sakate hai?'' iske alaava apane purvavarti or hameshaa kahin jane kii jaldbaaji main rahane vaale shivaraj singh chouhan ke vipareet kamalnath logon ke liye nirdhaarit 15 minute ke samay main puri talleenta se baat sunate hai
 Kamal Nath and Chauhan have one thing in common, and that is that they sleep very briefly and are non-vegetarian
 mukhyamantri ke sachivalay main kaam kar chuke ek varisht prashasnic adhikari kehete hai, ''mukhyamantri ko hameshaa vyast rahanaa hota he or kendriya mantri ke mukaable use zyada der tak kaam karnaa hota he, kyonki use rajnatik or prashasnic donon hi morchon par faisle lene hote hai
 In the case of a Union Minister, the prime minister's job is to take political decisions
 ''prashasnic morche par kamalnath ke saamne sabase badi chunauti kisaanon kii karjamaafee ko safalataa se lagu karne kii he
 Although the debt waiver has been announced, but who will benefit from it, there is a need to work on this subject
 agar is bare main spashtataa nahin ho pai to loksabhaa main congress ko nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 On the day Kamal Nath was declared Chief Minister, he said, "we will honor every promise mentioned in the manifesto
" '' jameen ke tukade hone or upaj kaa uchit mulya na milane se kisaan pehle se hi pareshaan hai or unhen aatmahatya ke liye vivash hona padataa he
 This crisis of agriculture cannot be resolved through measures like debt waiver
 iske sthaayee samaadhaan ke liye krishi ke buniyadi dhaanche ke kshetra main nivesh or aabaadi ko isse jude duusare kshetron main modeye kii jarurat he
 The loan waiver, which benefited about 80 lakh farmers, cost the government exchequer Rs 56,000 crore
 kaa boj padane kaa anumaan he
 In view of this, doubts are being expressed as to how the Congress government will be able to bear this burden without any major impact on the state's economy
 2018-19 main rajya kaa bajet kareeb 2,04,642 karod ru

 Several other promises of the Congress are also going to have economic implications such as halving the electricity bill of farmers, giving the unemployed Rs 4,000

 The party paid Rs 51,000 at the time of the girls' wedding

 Former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh is playing an interesting role as a mentor of the state government
 ve kamalnath ko sanghathan kii bhaawanaaon se avgat karaane vaale shaks ke taur par kaam kar rahe hai
 Kamal Nath also knows how deep Digvijay's grip on the Congress organization is
 donon kaa saath purana he
 Kamal Nath was his biggest helper during Digvijay Singh's tenure as the Chief Minister
 khaskar tab jab arjuna singh ne congress chhodkar tiwari congress kaa daaman thama tha or pradesh kii congress sarkaar ko asthir karne kii dhamkee di thi
 Both are old in facing challenges
 nai sarkaar ke kuch faislon ne vivaad ko janm diya he jaise ki mantralay main karmchaariyon kaa vande maataram gaanaa band karnaa or use dobaaraa shuru karnaa or immergency ke dauraan misa bandiyon ko ab tak milane vaali 25,000 ru
 They include the closure of the monthly pension
 kamalnath ke liye yah bhi ek chunauti he ki ve apane faislon par kadam waapas khinchne kii jagah un par kaayam rahen
 By pulling back, BJP will get strength
 kuch tabadalon ke bare main pratikriya dete hue purv mukhyamantri chouhan ne kaha tha, ''faisle liye ja rahe hai or phir unhen waapas liya ja rahaa he
 It is not clear who is running the government
 ''mukhyamantri kii ek praathamikta maranasann audyogic kshetra ko phir se punerjeevit karne kii hogi
 Apart from this, creation of employment is also an immediate challenge
 purv kii bhaajapa sarkaar ne nivesh ke kai sammelnon kaa aayojan kiya tha jisamen nami-giraami udyogpatiyon ne hissaa liya tha lekin keval kapadaa kshetra ko chhodkar nivesh main kisi tarah kii vruddhi nahin dikhaai di, jisamen purv mukhyamantri chouhan ke nirvachan kshetra budhani main vardhaman or trident ke plant lage the
 Kamal Nath's experience as a Commerce Minister and his ability to attract industries in Chhindwara can be useful

 Law and order is also a big challenge in view of increasing crimes in the state: According to the NCRB data, the state has the highest number of rape cases and the record is poor in preventing atrocities against scs / sts

 Now such filmmakers will not find you anywhere, but Gurudutt will continue to miss films like 'pyaasa', 'pepper Ke Phool', 'sahab, Bibi Aur Ghulam'
 kai tarah ke sangeet ko milakar bhi gurudutt ne adbhut prayog kiye
 Gurudutt was a perfectionist, he used to shut down whenever he felt he could not do justice to the film
 yahi vajah he ki unki kai filmein adhuri rah gayi
 Apart from the technical side, even as a filmmaker, Gurudutt realized his social responsibilities
 tabhi to mana jaataa he ki gurudutt aazaadee ke baad aise pehle filmkaar the, jinhone apni filmon main yah dikhaane kii koshish kii ki jis tarah ke saamaajik nyaay kii baat aazaadee se pehle kii jaati thi, vah aazaadee ke baad logon ko nahin mila

 Guru Dutt had everything he wished to be happy in the world

 Despite this, he was restless

 Bangla novelist Bimal Mitra was seen very closely to his restless life
 inhen ke upanyaas ‘sahab bivi gulam’ par gurudutt ne mashhoor film banaai thi or isaki patakatha ke liye unhone bimal mitra ko kolkata se khaastaur par bulaayaa tha

 In such a situation, after the death of Guru Dutt, these novels reveal the story of the relationship between Guru Dutt's life and wife Geeta Dutt and the growing closeness of Waheeda Rehman

 What a strange coincidence that his own life was also full of tragedy
 duniya main sukhi hone ke liye insaan jin chizon kii kaamana karata he, guru dutt ke paas vah sab kuch tha
 Honor, honor, wealth, prestige, health, beautiful wife and lovely children
 iske baavjood vah baichaiyn rahete the
 He said - i had to become a director, i became
 abhinayta bananaa tha, ban gaya
 Had to make a good picture, made it
 kaaphi paisa bhi he, lekin kuch bhi nahin he
 This emptiness also reached that level of depression when he attempted suicide
 unke is baichaiyn jivan ke behad kareeb se dekha tha bangla upanyaaskaar bimal mitra ne
 Gurudutt made a famous film on his novel 'sahab Biwi Ghulam' and he specially invited Bimal Mitra from Kolkata for the script
 jivan ke antim chaar-paanch varshon main gurudutt kii bimal mitra se kaaphi nikatataa rahi
 After the untimely death of Guru Dutt, Bimal Mitra wrote a novel whose Hindi translation is published by Vani Prakashan titled 'bichhude all bari-bari'
 bimal mitra ‘sahab bivi gulam’ kii patakatha lekhan ke silsile main guru dutt ke bangale or form house par rahe
 So they had also met their family members
 aise main guru dutt kii maut ke baad unke in upanyaas se guru dutt ke jivan or patni gita dutt ke bich ke sambandhon or rishte main upje tanaav kii kahani or wahidaa rahamaan se badhati nikatataa ke sach kaa andaja lagata he
 Bimal Mitra writes that he used to wonder that Guru Dutt had a luxurious bungalow at Pali Hill, but he could not sleep there
 vah sari raat whisky ke gilaas or cigarette sulagaate hue guzaar dete the or subah taiyaar hokar studio pahunch jate or apane mechap room ko andar se bandakar gahari neend main so jate the
 According to Bimal Mitra, two or two powers were present inside Gurudutt
 ek taraf vah vilaasi, bhogi or vikhyath shaks the
 There he used to be surprised and upset
 inakam tex, vakil or apane studio main param vyast
 Extremely upset
 duusari taraf vah gyani, dheer, sthir, vivekwan, dayaalu, dani, nisprih or ahankaar mukt the
 Bimal Mitra further writes, the second incumbent Gurudutt used to read books of literature in the night
 vah insaan atyant bhikhaari tha
 Used to think about whether God is there or not
 us insaan kii jaruratein maamuli thim, jiskaa guzaara ek jodi rabad kii chappal, ek adad sando ganji or ek lungi par chal saktaa tha
 Sometimes there was no money in that person's pocket

 In the lives of Guru Dutt and Geeta Dutt, the tension increased only after six years of marriage
 isaki ek vajah wahidaa rahamaan ko mana jaataa he, jinke saath unke prem prasang se jude gocip chalate the
 However, according to a Bimal friend, geeta-waheeda resembled two sisters of the same family
 donon ke rishton ke bich tanaav kii ahm vajah yah bhi thi ki gurudutt baad main nahin chaahate the ki gita filmon main gaayen
 He wanted Geeta to be focused on household, which was not only painful for a star like her, but also humiliating
 ‘sahab bivi or gulam’ kii kahani darasal gurudutt ke apane jivan kii kahani thi, jiske bare main gita dutt ne bhi bimal mitra ko bataaya tha

 The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has made some changes in the board exams to be held in class 10th in 2019
 taaja report ke mutabik kaksha 10veen ke chaatro ke lieganitki pariksha main badlaav kiye gaye hai, jahansibiasaiganit kii pariksha ke liye do prashn patron ke set banane par vichaar kar rahi he
 In which a hard and a difficult paper will be set
 bataa den, jo chaatr ganit main achche nahin he vahasanpaper kaa opshan chun sakate hai
 Let me tell you, there will be two options for Mathematics exams
 jisamen vah standard level yaa maujuuda level ke ganit ke prashn patr paper kaa opshan chun sakate hai
 By the end of this year, students will have to fill their math test options while filling the form
 report ke anusaar sibiesai kii ore se ye faisla un chaatro ke liye liya gaya he jo chaatr apni aage kii padhai ganit vishay main nahin karnaa chaahate hai, isliye vah chaatr ganit ke aasaan paper ko hal karne kaa opshan chun sakate hai
 Let me tell you, no information has come about this decision officially yet
 12veen kaksha ke liye bhi lagu hoga niyam?sibiesai kaa kahana he ki agar ye niyam 10veen ke chaatro ke liye saxesphul sabit hota he to is 12veen ke chaatro ke liye bhi lagu kiya jayega
 For this, the board has formed a 15-member committee, which will comprise experts in mathematics, universities, schools and NCERT
 aapako bataa den, board adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki bhale hi ganit ke do paper honge, lekin unke selebus ek hi hoga
 The paper will be examined at two different levels
 ejineering chaatro ke liemushkilhogi ganit kii parikshajo chaatr aage ejineering karnaa chaahate hai or jwanit entrens test (JEE) kii taiyaari kar rahe hai, board unke liye ganit kii pariksha mushkil rakhega
 On the other hand, for the students who are going to take the National Eligibility Test (NEET) exam to study medical, the math paper will be kept easy
 sibiesai ne kaha ki is prastaav ke lagu ho jane ke baad ise ensiiarti bheja jayega taaki ise selebus main shaamil kiya ja sake
 At the same time, students who want to pursue a career in arts can choose the option of easy math paper
 jaane- kab hogi sibiesai kii parikshabta den, hindustan times ke anusaar, adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki acadmic parikshaon kaa aayojan march main hi kiya jayega or board jald hi chaatro ke liye nayaa time-teble jari kar degaa
 With this, students will be able to prepare for their exam on the basis of that

 After the terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, the all-round surrounded Pakistan has once again taken action against the terrorist organizations
 guuruuvaar ko pakistan sarkaar ne global aatanki hafiz said ke sanghathan jamaat-ud-daawa or falaah-e-insaaniyat foundation par bain laga diya
 This action is seen as an action taken under the pressure created after Pulwama, although the name of the jaish-e-mohammed organization is not taken in this decision, which is the real culprit of the Pulwama terror attack
 aisi karrwai se kya hoga?aisa pehali baar nahin he jab pakistan ne in sanghathanon par karrwai kii ho, isse pehle bhi jab usapar antarrashtriya banataa he to vah aise pantare apanaataa rahata he
 Now once again under this pressure, Pakistan has taken this step
 haalanki, isse koi khaas fark padataa nahin dikhaai pad rahaa he, kyonki isse pehle bhi jab-jab pakistan ne in par bain lagaaya he to har baar hafiz said ek nae aatanki sanghathan ke saath duniya ke saamne aayaa he
 For example, when lashkar-e-taiba was banned, he named it jamaat-ud-dawa
 tamaam rokon ke baavjood hafiz aaj bhi khuleam reliyaan karata najar aayaa he
 Ban has been imposed on Hafiz's organization even before, the period of this ban was over which Pakistan has extended
 in sanghathanon ko hafiz charity ke taur par dikhaata he or aatank failaane ke liye paisa ikattha karata he
 Is the pressure of Pulwama attack? jaish-e-mohammed is the real culprit of the terrorist attack in Pulwama on 14 February
 bharat samet anya deshon ne pakistan par dabaav banaaya ki usapar karrwai kii jaae
 Pakistan took action but not on Jaish
 uski ore se sirf jud samet anya aise sanghathanon par bain lagaaya gaya jinaki charity sandigdh he
 That is, Maulana Masood Azhar, the leader of jaish-e-mohammed, is still under the security of Pakistan Army
 pakistan ko kyon lenaa padaa ection?darasal, pakistan kaa ye ection bharat yaa kisi anya ke dabaav main nahin he balki iske peeche uskaa dar he
 The international body Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is scheduled to meet, in which Pakistan is included in the gray list
 ye sanstha kuch deshon ko aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai ladane ke liye paisa muhaiyaa karaati he
 India is trying to get Pakistan blacklisted by FATF so that it does not get any help
 yahaan blaclist hone kaa matlab ye bhi he ki pakistan kii reating IMF, world bank samet anya antarrashtriya sansthaaon main bhi giregi or use bada ghaataa uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Ban on the organization here, preparations for war there! Let us know from one side that Pakistan is taking action against these organizations to show themselves to be a terror-stricken country
 to vahiin duusari taraf vah bharat ke khilaaf sajeesh bhi rach rahaa he

 aspx The fate of Sant Rampal, who has decided from Satlok to bars, is now in the court's fist
 lekin rampal ke jail jate hi uske ashram kaa tilism tut kar bikharane laga he
 If you get a glimpse of the fort somewhere in this ashram, then a secret hideout is seen
 kahin aaramgaah dikhataa he to kahin aadambar kaa adda bhi
 Overall, this ashram is more ashram less baba lok
 ashram ke aahate main machaan bane hue hai
 Seeing these scaffolds at first sight, it can be presumed that they were probably constructed with the intention of construction
 lekin machaan ke upar rakhe gaddon or aas-paas kii jagah par najar daalate hi sari kahani saaf ho jaati he
 From petrol bombs to acid and a bucket full of stones, slingshot
 duusare lafjon main kahen to maut kaa har wo saamaan, jisase hamalaa kiya ja sake
 That can be killed lekin ashram jaisi ek jagah, jahaan kehane ko to aatma or paramatma ke milan kii baaten hoti hai, vahaan maut ke ye saamaan chaunkaate hai
 It is another matter that this scaffolding and the truth of these things have become common before the world
 rampal kii giraftaar ke saath hi pichley 18 dinon se inhen machaanon ke jariye police or kanoon ke khilaaf chhedi gai jang ke hisaab kii ghadi kareeb aa chuki he
 The fact is that Rampal, who is trying to save himself by hiding in the grip of women and children, is now in a grip
 ye or baat he ki wo khud ko bekasoor bataane se baj nahin aa rahaa
 But the tilism of Rampal's Satlok Ashram is still more
 ashram main he ek khaas darwazaashram kaa main get
 That is, the place through which the way for devotees to come in and go
 lekin is get se thodaa aage badhate hi sin board par najar padati he
 It is necessary for every devotee to do his search before entering the ashram here and reaching his guru and if there is any shortage in his safety, countless hand held metal detectors are also arranged for this
 kisi kile ke abhedya dwaar kii tarah ashram ke do hisson ko alag karata lohe kaa ek get
 According to the police, common devotees are not allowed inside this gate
 wo naam daan or bhakthi ke baad sidhe apane aaraam karne kii jagah yani is darmetry tak pahunch sakate hai
 But Rampal, along with a select few of his warlords, remains imprisoned in this fort within this huge gate
 baba ke living room ke saath swimming pool bhirampal ke satalok ashram ke rahasyon se jaise-jaise pardaa uth rahaa he, rampal kaa cheharaa bhi benakaab hota ja rahaa he
 So did Rampal play a game of hypocrisy under the guise of Santai? Was he fooling people in the name of discourse and naam daan? This question is because inside pictures of Satlok Ashram are telling this ashram not Aashram, but Aramgah
 rampal ke living room se sata ek swimming pul bhi he
 In fact, this is the place for him to get tired, where Rampal used to swim often after Bhajan-sermon
 pul ke paas hi rampal kaa vishaal palang, malmali gadda, shandaar sopha or chadhaave se aanevaali lakhon kii rakam sahejane ke liye rakhi gai electronic tijoriyaan hai
 Rampal's exclusive bathroom in the ashram is also so luxurious that visitors can be surprised
 ashram main he gupt rastashayad yahi vajah he ki rampal ne jahaan ek taraf to apane ashram ko lohe ke get ke jariye khaas or aam ke hisse main baant rakhaa he, vahiin khaas ilaake se or bhi khaas jagah tak pahunchane ke liye ek gupt raste kaa bhi intjaam he
 This secret road leads to the private floor of the five-storeyed Kothinuma Ashram, where no one except Rampal was allowed to go
 lekin khud ko fakkad jindagi jeene vaale kabir ke anuyaayi bataane vaale rampal ke vilasita kii ye kahani tab or bhi hairaan karti he, jab talaashi ke dauraan ashram shakti vardhak dawaaen bhi haath lagati hai
 According to the police, the police have also received strength enhancing medicines from Rampal's ashram, which are often used by people to increase their sexual arousal
 rampal kii vishaal rasoi or aadhyatm ke aadambar ke liye taiyaar ek pravachan ghar bhi he
 On one side, in this huge hall, there is a arrangement of thousands of people sleeping together
 vahiin duusari taraf ashram kii rasoi se har roj hajaaron logon kii pet bharti he
 But the problem is when there is ंडandbar in the name of discourse and by feeding the food of this kitchen, the innocent and gullible devotees are shielded to avoid the law
 purana he rampal or jail kaa rishtarampal pehali baar ek murder cese main saal 2006 main jail gaya tha
 From then on, he went through all the tricks and escaped from the hands of the police and the law
 lekin is baar chali rampal kii is nai nautanki ke baad ab us par 19 sangeen dharaaen lagaai gai hai
 In these streams, punishment from life imprisonment to death is possible
 police ke hathe chadhate hi sari henkadi hawa ho gai rampal kii
 After the arrest, Baba did a lot of Baba, but the police cited the list of his crimes and the sections imposed on him, as the light dried up
 adalati aadesh ko chunauti dete hue rampal ne jo kiya he, uske badale sajaa-e maut tak ho sakati he
 In addition, more than half of the property may have to be lost
 koun-koun si dharenrampal par dharaaen aisi lagi he ki ab koi tikadam nahin kaam aa saktaa
 The police have registered a case against Baba Rampal and his spokesperson, Ashram Manager Committee and followers under separate sections like sedition
 inamen dhara-120, jo aapraadhik sajeesh se judaa he
 The punishment in this will be decided according to the severity of the crime
 dhara-121, iske tahat aarope desh droh kaa he, jisamen sajaa umrakaid se lekar faansee tak ho sakati he
 Section 121-A, is a case of plotting war against the country
 sajaa umrakaid tak hoti he
 Section-122, charged with armament of war with intent to do so, may carry a sentence of life imprisonment
 iske alaava hatya kii koshish main dhara-123, sajaa ho sakati he 10 saal se umrakaid tak kii
 Section 436, arson, in which the punishment can range from 10 years to life imprisonment
 in dhaaraon ke alaava sarkari duty main baadha pahunchane, bandhak banane, aapraadhik shadyantr rachane jaisi dharaaen bhi rampal par lagaai gai he
 That is, if the crime is proved, it is sure to eat the jail air for at least a lifetime
 itnaa hi nahin, baba ko harjaana bhi 50 karod rupee kaa chukaana pad saktaa he
 The High Court has already said that the expenses incurred on the 60-hour siege for arrest and the deployment of 45 thousand soldiers can be recovered from Baba's property
 yani jurmaana laga to baba kii kareeb aadhi sampati samajhie gai

 Now the department is silent on this and no one understands how the bill of a normal school can come so heavy
 skool koardinator yogendra mishra kii maane to unhone sabhi pichley bijli bill jamaa kar die hai lekin uske baad itnaa ek maah kaa bill aana tajjub kii baat he
 Yogendra Mishra says that he had complained about this electricity bill in the office of the Managing Director of Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam
 lekin vahaan par unhen software kii gadabadi bataa kar waapas bhej diya gaya

 yogendra mishra bataate hai ki bijli ke bill ko thik karaane ke liye vah pichley kai dinon se bijli vibhaag ke chakkar laga rahe hai lekin unhen aashwaasan ke alaava kuch bhi nahin mila
 Officials also deposited one and a half rupees 9 and a half rupees in the name of correction, but even after that the bill of 6 billion has come and now in the event of not depositing this electricity bill, the date of disconnection is September 7 and as The date is getting closer, as the school worries are increasing

 What was the incident? According to ACB Superintendent of Police Rajesh Bansode, the constable was the first to pay the money
 jise ek car se duusari car main baithne ke liye kaha gaya
 When the car continued to run on the road, he got the message to change the car
 ACB kaa consteble ek car se duusari car main savaar ho gaya lekin paise lene vaala shaks kisi or car main tha
 After this, after going some distance, again i got the message that now you have to sit in another car
 haalanki jab consteble ne ek baar phir car badali to is car main paise lene ke liye aayaa shaks maujuud tha
 However, when the constable gave the money, the man who came to get the money got a clue and tried to run away from the car

 rajasthan ke bikaner main ek hairaan karne vaala maamla saamne aayaa he
 Here, a person kept reading Hanuman Chalisa during the surgery of brain tumor and the doctors removed his brain tumor

 Chennai Super Kings team is going to make a comeback in IPL-2018 after two years of suspension
 super kings ne to isaki taiyaariyaan bhi shuru kar di hai
 CSK has claimed that Mahendra Singh Dhoni is still the biggest target for him and he will remain the most important link in the team
 mana ja rahaa he team ke is nazariye se dhoni behad khush hai
 In the current ODI series against Australia, as soon as Mahendra Singh Dhoni stepped on Chepauk, slogans of dhoni-dhoni were started all over the stadium
 shrinivasana se dhoni kaa milanaa, surkhiyon mempichley dinon dhoni chennai sthit india cement ke offis gaye the
 During this time he was former BCCI President Ann
 shrinivasana se bhi mili, jo soshal media par charchaa kaa vishay rahaa
 Currently Dhoni is also the Vice President of India Cements
 lekin- duusari taraf phens kaa ek aisa bhi samooh bhi he, jo maan rahaa he ki aane vaale sijan main maahi siesake ke pile rang kii jersey main nahin dikhenge
 In such a situation, brand guru Harish Bijoor and former Indian cricketer Nikhil Chopra believe that the franchise will break down to bid on Dhoni during the ipl's 'mega Auction' next year
 aisa kahana he exparts kaa-harish bijur ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki bhartiya cricket main philhal dhoni ek badi 'property' hai
 Nobody stays around them, they are icons
 maujuuda samay main keval dhoni ke saath viraat kohli ko hi khadaa kiya ja saktaa he
 Kohli is ahead of Dhoni in terms of brand value, but Mahi himself is ideal for any team
 'nikhil chopra kaa maananaa he ki dhoni ipel ke sabase mahange khilaadiyon ke top-5 main honge
 His amazing leadership skills prove to be the most helpful in helping the team win
 jahaan tak ipel kii baat he, to ni:andeh bahut sari timen dhoni par boli lagane liye betaab dikhengi
 Will teams be able to retain some of their players? The big question is, can teams allow them to retain some of their players before the auction? At present, all the players are being asked to bid
 lekin ho saktaa he ki ilmen badlaav ho or kuch timen apane ikon players ko rittin karne main kaamyaab ho jaaen
 Anyway, the fans cannot think of Chennai without Dhoni, RCB without Virat and Mumbai without Gambhir's KKR and Rohit

 (rising pune superjoint- 2016) India has become the fifth largest producer of electronic waste in the world
 bharat ne 2014 main 17 lakh ton electronic or electrical upkaran kachare ke rup main nikaale
 This information has been given in a United Nations report
 i-kachra paidaa karne main america sabase agesamyukt raashtra kii report main chetaya gaya he ki agle teen saal main global str par i-kachra 21 fisadi tak bad saktaa he
 The United Nations University's Global e-waste Monitor 2014 states that the United States and China produced the highest e-waste in 2014
 i-kachra paidaa karne ke maamle main america pehle paaydaan par, china duusare, japan tisare or germany chauthe paaydaan par rahaa
 Asia has the highest e-waste last year, highest in the world 1
 6 karod ton i-kachra asia main paidaa hua
 Among these, 6 million tonnes were produced in China, 2
2 million tonnes in Japan and 1
7 million tonnes in India
 vahiin europe main sabase jayada i-kachra karne vaale deshon main norge pehle, switzraland duusare, iceland tisare, denmark chauthe or britain paanchaven paaydaan par rahaa
 At least 19 lakh tonnes of e-waste originated in Africa
 report ke mutabik, 2018 main i-kachare kii maatra 21 fisadi tak badhkar 5 karod ton pahunchane kii sambhaavna he
 Less than mobile waste generated last year, only seven per cent of e-waste was mobile phones, calculators, pcs, printers and small IT equipment, while about 60 per cent of the vacuum cleaner, toasters, electric razors, video cameras used in homes and businesses
 , Appliances such as washing machines and electric stoves
 -input bhashaa se December 3 is celebrated as International Day of Persons with Disabilities
 1992 main sanyukt raashtra ne yah din isliye tay kiya tha taaki iske bahaane aam logon or sarkaron ke bich alag se shaareerik or maansik taur par sakshmata ko lekar samaj bane or unke hisaab se adhikaron kii samaj samaaj main bane
 So that if we see that there is no building, no road or market or office, then the first question comes to mind that its absence is a violation of constitutional right
 kuch din pehle main california gaya tha
 Saw a public bus in Monterey
 main hairaan ho gaya puri prakriya ko dekhakar
 The driver of the bus was boarding an elderly physically weak person with hydraulic lift in full responsibility
 bas main aisi lift kaa hona hi mere liye sukhad aashcharya tha
 Proud that this can be achieved
 ek baat or samaj ai
 When the system is trusted, one can go to the market alone at this stage of age
 aap video dekhenge to pataa chalegaa ki is umr ke buzurg ko ham log shaayad hi akele baahar jane den kyonki baahar system nadaarad he
 You watch this video phir maang kiijie ki bharat main ye kyon nahin ho saktaa he
 On Monday night All India was listening to a discussion on the eve of Disabled Day on the radio
 ek collar ne jab puch diya ki kai railgadiyon se viklangon ke liye bane vishesh coach kii vyavastha samaapt kar di gai he to charchaa main shaamil jimmedaar se jawaab dete na bana
 He said that he is talking to the Railways
 hamen ek suzav mila he ki viklangon ke liye coach kaa sthaan fiks hona chahie
 Either stand at the rear or immediately after the engine but do not change suddenly
 is maamle main dilli main kaaphi kuch mil jaataa he lekin baaki rajyon main bahut bura haal he
 There is a worse situation in the villages
 nitiyon ke str par bhale hi kuch badlaav dikhne laga he magar lagu hone ke str par bahut acha kaam nahin ho paa rahaa he
 In 2016, the Government of India created The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act i
e
 RPWD Act 2016 which takes into consideration the convenience, honor and rights of such people
 nae kanoon main shaareerik or maansik kshamta ke daayre main aane vaale virgon ko 7 se badhaakar 21 kiya gaya he
 This includes people with visual impairment, low vision, intellectual disability, mental illness, speech and language dysfunction, deaf, muscular dystrophy, victims of acid attack, Parkinson's disease, thalassemia, hemophilia, autism spectrum disorder
 ye kanoon kahata he ki sarkaar or sthaneey prashasan in dikkaton se grast bacchon ko sarkari madad se chalane vaali sabhi shikshan sansthaaon main shiksha muhaiyaa karavaayega
 Will enroll them without any discrimination, provide sports and entertainment facilities to all
 imaarat, campus or anya suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karavaayega
 The person will make appropriate arrangements according to the specific needs
 uttam shaikshanik or saamaajik vikaas ke liye jaruri sahyog degaa
 This will ensure that children who are unable to see and hear are taught in the language and manner they understand
 seekhney ke kram main bacchon ke saamne aane vaali dikkaton ko jald se jald samaj kar uskaa uchit hal nikaalega
 Will provide appropriate facilities and support to such children
 har paanch saal par schuli bacchon kaa survey kar aise bacchon kii pahchaan karegaa jinhen vishesh sahyog kii jarurat ho yaa jinamein kisi tarah kii aakshamata ho
 This survey will have to be done within two years of the implementation of this law of 2016 so that teacher training institutes can be established for such children
 sin language or braille main prashikshit shikshakon ko training or naukari dena bhi is kanoon kaa makasad he
 Now the question is that the law has been made, but how much is implemented
 kya hamaari prashasnic vyavastha or hamaara samaaj shaareerik aakshamata se grast logon kii bhaawanaaon ke prati samvedansheel he
 Physically challenged people have the same right to be respected as we and you are
 desh bhar main kai jagahon par aaj viklangon ne pradarshan kiye hai
 They say that even jobs reserved for us are not available on time nor do they come vacancies
 sarkaar kahati he ki viklaangata kaa aarakshan badha diya gaya he lekin naukariyaan kahaan aa rahi hai
 a good suggestion has come as to why there is no separate examination for the disabled
 railway main hi chunaavon ke samay bhartee nikali thi magar viklang apni samasya ko lekar kai dinon se dilli ke mandi house par pradarshan kar rahe the
 Nobody even went to ask them
 ek masalaa pension kaa he
 You will be surprised to know how much the center pays its share for disability pension
 maatr 300 rupee
 While Delhi Government 2500
 kai rajyon main 500 bhi hai
 People with disabilities say that the leaders take photographs by distributing equipment, but equipment is not the only need
 hamen avasar bhi milanaa chahie
 This seemed right because there is some help by hand-pulling a rickshaw or scooter, but there should be equality in opportunities
 skool main admician se lekar jivan ke anya kshetron main bhi barabari kii bhagidaari honi chahie
 Many diseases are also associated with disability whose expenses are often not just about the cost
 jaise muscular distrophylihaaja jaruri he ki RPWD Act 2016 ko sakhti se amal main laayaa jaae
 Society should be sensitized to the needs of such people
 sabhi sarkari vibhaag aisi samvedansheeltaa badhaane ke liye kaarykram chalaaen
 There should be punishment and penalty for violation of the law related to it
 prabhaviton ke rojgaar or punervaasi ke liye kaarykram banaae jaaen
 Education should not be just a formality, it should be implemented seriously
 or is kaam main sirf sarkari hi nahin nijee sansthaaon kii bhi bhoomika sunishchit kii jaae
 Last month, the Delhi government formed a state-level committee of six members to conduct research on disability according to the new Act
 ye cameti Disability se judi har research kii nigaraanee karegi
 The dean of Maulana Azad Medical College will be its chairperson and this committee will be for three years
 isi act ke nirdeshon ke maddenjar dilli sarkaar ke shiksha vibhaag ne har jile main nodel officers kii niyukti kii he jo sarkari skulon or sarkari madad se chalane vaale skulon main shaareerik or maansik taur par vishesh kshamta vaale bacchon se jude sabhi maamalon ko dekhegi
 These nodal officers will send quarterly report of such children admitted in all the schools under their jurisdiction to the Directorate of Education
 agar emdlaar airlines kii purv airhostes geetika sharma ne 5 agast kii subah pankhe se latakkar apni jaan na di hoti, to haryana kaa purv grih rajyamantri gopal goyal kanda desh main mahila shashaktikaran kii misaal ban chukaa hota
 After all, it has placed 19 women in its 36 companies on directors or similar high positions
 vahi aisa netaa he jisane chunaav prachaar ke liye mahilaon kii alag jansabha bulaai or vahi aisa shaks he jisaki mehfil main aane ke liye puja batra, rati agnihotri se lekar hema malini jaisi diggaj hiroinon ne bhi kabhi inkaar nahin kiya
 He changed the fortunes of almost every girl associated with him
 kisi ko tohfe main bmdablyoo car di, to kisi par puraa showrooms hi nyochaavar kar diya
 It was Kanda's view that many modest women employees like Geetika rose to high positions in the company overnight
 lekin yah mahaj ittefaq nahin he ki sharaab se tauba or shabaab se muhabbat karne vaale kanda ne zyaadaatar unheen hasinaaon kaa uddhaar kiya jo yaa to avivaahit thim yaa phir apane pati ko chhodie ko taiyaar
 The eldest son of the staunch Sanghi Muralidhar Kanda, who lost the assembly elections from Sirsa on a Jan Sangh ticket in 1952, knew from the beginning what things are most spoken in the corridors of politics
 kanda ke aradhy tara baba kii kutiyaa main uske sahyogi rahe liladhar saini kaaphi soch vichaar kar yah daawa karte hai, "gopal ke dimag se shcoke shastrya kii tarj vaale saste upanyaason kii ve kahaniyaan kabhi nahin utrin jinamein aurat or paise ke bal par har cheez hasil karne kii misaalen bhari hoti hai
 His bookstore may not have run, but these books made his mind go well
 " kabhi uske siyaasi rahanuma rahe ajay chatala kehete hai, "vah shuddh rup se dalal he
 If investigated in depth, this case will prove to be the biggest sex racket in the country
 "lekin in aaropon se beparwaah kanda paisa kamaane ke safar par aage badhata gaya or uski raajadaar mahilaon kii sankhya bhi badhati rahi
 Geetika Sharma, Ankita Singh, Nupur Mehta and Aruna Singh are just a few names that went public due to a legal tussle, but there are more girls in Kanda's world whose growth graphs these women
 sirsa main uske parivaar ke kaarobaar ko dekhne vaali ek ladki ke parivaar kii kismat chand saal main badal gai
 Previously, where the financial condition of this girl's family was poor, now her father is running a showroom of cars
 kanda kii ek or company main ek mahila bahut teji se sioo ke pad tak pahunch gai
 a man who had been a driver of Kanda for a long time told, "after coming to Gurgaon, Kanda Saheb recruited a woman secretary
 secretary ko saaf nirdesh tha ki vah file paas karake laae, bhale hi iskeliye kuch bhi karnaa pade
 "doing anything for success is like Kanda's mantra
 uski kitabon kii dukaan (1979), jupiter electronics (1982), juuton kii dukaan (1985), bottleband pani or juuta banane kii factory ek ke baad ek naakaam huin lekin uske hausale kabhi post nahin hue
 She opened MDLR Airlines but was in a loss
 goa main do casino khole, ve bhi kabhi chal nahin sake
 But the number of girls in his life and business continued to grow
 saath hi shandaar partiyaan or beshkeemtee gift dene ke uske shauk par bhi koi asar nahin padaa
 Saini explains, "I asked Kanda that brother, your business is running in losses, then why have you kept so many girls in airlines? Why do you stick to the business of losses
" jawaab main kanda ne kaha tha ki saini tum tehre bhagat aadmi
 What will you understand about business? ye ladkiyaan or hawaii jahaaj munafa kamaane ke liye nahin, rasukhdaar logon main apni pahunch banane ke liye hai
 "and something similar happened
 1997 main tara baba ke 'aadesh' par sirsa chhod gudgaanv aae kanda ne real estate ke maidan main ubharate is kasbe kii nabj ko jaise pakad liya
 Kanda came close to Gurgaon's real estate business after he came close to the late Surendra Singh, son of former Haryana Chief Minister Bansi Lal
 phir garaj padi to ajay chatala ke 'juute' bhi khaae
 After 2003, there was a time when it would have been impossible to make any big land deal in Gurgaon without Kanda, who was doing a small business of changing the land use of the plot allocated to the Scheduled Castes
 uske sahyogi surendra minchnaavadi kehete hai, "kanda property kaa keedaa he
 Just like a kabaddi recognizes a pricey thing in a junk from the junk mountain, Kanda bets on the right property
 " kanda ne property ke dhandhe main apane bemisaal hunar se paisa kamaaya
 He never delayed to understand the pulse of politics
 jab kanda ne dekha ki 2009 main bhupendra singh hooda haryana ke takht par dobaaraa kabiz ho gaye hai to vah turant hooda ke kheme main shaamil ho gaya
 His friendship with Hooda reached Gaharai and the chief minister started feeding cakes at his birthday party (see box)
 darasal, berthde party shuru se hi kanda ke jansampark abhiyaan kaa bada manch rahi
 He gave his first major birthday party in 1998 at the Bristol Hotel in Gurgaon, where Surendra Singh was also present
 kanda ne jald hi gudgaanv main apana farm house banaaya
 And before his arrest in this farm house, there used to be fabulous parties twice a week
 khud sharaab ko haath na lagane vaala kanda in partiyon main sharaab kii nadiyaan baha detaa tha
 According to a person attending the parties, Russian and Uzbek girls were also seen here along with Indian girls
 daulat kaa nasha badha to kanda ne 2009 main goa main mint casino bhi kharida
 The biggest nobles of Haryana did not do the work that Kanda did and took 40 people from Haryana to the inauguration of the casino
 uske nimantran patr kii khaasiyat yah thi ki card ke saath aane-jane ke hawaii tikat chaspaan the
 Many who went to the casino party confirmed that it was the best party of his life, where he enjoyed everything that the common man thinks in his dreams
 goa ke ye do casino 'mint' or 'casino rio' kanda kii jindagi main khaas mahatv rakhte hai
 In fact, Kanda wanted to settle his alleged partner Ankita Singh away from Sirsa in a place where his family could not interfere and the search for such a place ended up as a casino in Goa
 haalanki iske baad bhi ankitha gudgaanv aati-jaati rahi
 Ankita has been in Singapore with her child since Geetika's suicide scandal and till now the police have not been able to interrogate her
 inhen casino main baad main kanda apni ek or puraani sahyogi noopur mehta ko bhi le aayaa
 He is the same Nupur Mehta whose name came up in the cricket match fixing controversy a few months ago
 kanda-noopur ke rishte utaar-chadhaav bhare rahe
 According to police sources, Kanda has said that he had given a house of 500 square yards to Nupur in Gurgaon as a gift
 lekin jab noopur pehali baar usase alag hui to 2009 main kanda ne gunde bhejkar us makaan ko khaali bhi kara liya
 However, Nupur has denied any such gifts
 ise kanda kii badakismati hi kahenge ki usne geetika ko bhi goa bhej diya
 According to the police, there was a fierce battle among the three women regarding their proximity to Kanda
 noopur or ankitha ne yahaan geetika ke khilaaf cese bhi darj karaayaa tha
 On the other hand, Aruna Chadda, the oldest ruler of Kanda, has been described by Geetika as the kingpin of the entire Khurafat in her suicide note
 ek bachche kii maa aruna bhi apane pati se alag rahati he
 Aruna, who once held the entire MDLR group at her fingertips, is currently in jail and nobody is going to ask about her condition
 us par aarope he ki company kii echaar vibhaag kii pramukh hone ke naate vah company main ladakiyon kii bhartee karne or unhen kanda kii karatuuton main shaamil hone ke liye majaboor karti thi
 The police is spewing out one secret each from this royalty of Kanda and Kanda is reciting Hanuman Chalisa in judicial custody
 geetika ke suicide note main kanda ke liye likhe shabd 'bura aadmi' ne uski takadir kii rekhaaen ulajh di hai
 Two days before Geetika's death, Kanda bought a new red Hummer car
 isi din usne media se anaupchaarik baatcheet main kaha tha ki usne haryana main aisi 24 siton kii pahchaan kii he jahaan vaisya votaron kaa dabadabaa he
 In these seats, he will field his candidates and then without his will no one will be able to become Chief Minister in Haryana
 yani kanda hoga haryana kii siyasat kaa betaj badshaah
 Kanda's ambition was to be high, but in the arrogance of power and wealth he forgot that a woman is not a toy
 stri, purush ke mohpash main to jakad sakati he, lekin hameshaa ke liye uski tarakkee kii baazaaroo seedhi nahin ban sakati
 Despite being buried under Kanda's favor, Geetika thought it better to end herself rather than surrender
 uski maut hi kanda kii barabaadi kii vajah ban gai
 Politicians often learn such lessons by paying a high price
 or tab tak der ho chuki hoti he
 The Lok Sabha elections have been announced and BJP rebel Kalyan Singh has joined the Samajwadi Party some time ago
 aise main party muslimon ko safai dena kaa mauka kaise bhul sakati he
 Hence, the party's chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has started an exercise to strengthen his vote bank before the Lok Sabha elections by meeting with the Ulama of Darul Ulum
 udhar loksabhaa chunaav main congress or samaajawaadee party ke bich siton ke talmail par khinchataan ke asaar abhi se najar aane lage hai
 According to sources, the Congress has prepared the list of 24 candidates, which is going to be released very soon
 saaf he ki congress ye sanket de rahi he ki wo kam se kam 25 siton par talmail nahin kar rahi he
 According to sources, in this list, there are many names on which the Samajwadi Party has objections
 amitabh bachchan ne rajaneta amar singh pravartit energy deveopment company ke nideshak mandal se istipha de diya he
 Amitabh Bachchan has been a shareholder in this company
 niamak ko di jaankaree main energy deveopment company ne kaha ki bachchan ne company main swatantra nideshak ke pad se istipha de diya he or board kii baithak main unka istipha sweekaar kar liya gaya he
 The company also said that its executive chairman Amar Singh had expressed his inability to continue in the executive position and that he would become the non-executive chairman of the company next month
 kaaryakari chairman ke taur par singh kaa kaarykaal 31 july ko khatm ho jayega or unhone samay kii kami ke chalate kaaryakari bhoomika main bane rahane main asamarthta jataai he

 'bahubali 2' kii safalataa ke baad south superstar prabhas ko bollywood main ofer mil rahe hai
 There were reports that Karan Johar wanted to launch Prabhas in Bollywood under the banner of Dharma Productions, but Prabhas demanded a huge amount
 charchaaon kii maane to baari-bharkam fees kii vajah se karan johar ne apane kadam peeche hataa liye

 isse karan naaraaz bhi ho gaye hai
 Karan was also the distributor of 'bahubali' Hindi version
 bollywood ke kai superstars ke liye bhi prabhas kii fees hairaan karne vaali ho sakati he
 Prabhas is now recovering money from producers according to his stardom
 9 saal kaa he pyaar, kuch asi he prabhas-anoushka ke bich lav chemistrysutron ke hawaale se jo report ai he uske mutabik, telugu cinema main apni lokapriyata ko dekhte hue itane paison kii demand karnaa sahi he, lekin bollywood main itnaa paise maangana bevakoofi he
 Any South Indian actor, even Rajinikanth, never got much money in Hindi cinema
 bahubali or bahubali 2 ke baad karan, prabhas ko bollywood main launch karnaa chaahate the, lekin prabhas kii demand ko dekhte hue unhone yah idia drop kar diya he
 Prabhas has lost 6000 relationships, can engage with Anushka Shetty after 2 months! Karan has also tweeted a tweet on Thursday, which looks like he wants to give a message to Prabhas
 unhone likhaa he- agar mahatvakanksha ko safal hona he to use apane dushman (tulana) se dur rahanaa chahie

 ) During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi's biggest promise was that if his government comes, he will bring back all the black money deposited in foreign banks

 Narendra Modi had said, 'we will bring back every rupee deposited in foreign banks and ensure that it is used for the betterment of the poor

 Disclosure of Rs 14 Lakh Crore Black Money Now when the country is going to face elections again within a year, now is the time to examine how the Modi government has met the promise of black money
 asal main kul milakar dekhen to pichley chaar saal main kareeb 1
 14 lakh crore worth of black money has been detected
 aaie dekhte hai modi sarkaar ne kaale dhan par ankush ke liye pichley chaal saal main kya kadam uthaae or alag-alag maamalon main kya hai aankade
 
 
 The scheme to disclose black money by paying tax has been recovered under the Government's Voluntary Income Declaration Scheme (IDS) and a total of Rs 69,350 crore under the Black Money and Tax Imposition Act (BMIT Act)
 iske alaava pradhanmantri garib kalyaan yojana (PMGKY) ke tahat 5,000 karod rupee or aae hai
 The BMIT Act was implemented by the government in 2015
 iske tahat videsh main sampatti rakhane vaale logon ko ek baar main ekamusth tex dekar apane kaala dhan ko safed karne kaa mauka mila tha
 During July 1 to September 30, 2015, about 650 people disclosed their total assets of Rs 4,100 crore deposited in foreign banks under this scheme
 iske baad sarkaar ne do or aise tareeke muhaiyaa karaae
 The first was the 2016 Income Declaration Scheme (IDS)
 is yojana ke tahat pichley akalan varsh tak jin logon ne eemaandaaree se apni aay yaa sampatti kii ghoshnaa nahin kii thi, unhen iskaa khulaasa karne kaa mauka diya gaya
 In lieu of this, there was a provision to impose a lump sum tax of 45 per cent on his income
 idies ke tahat 64,275 logon ne 65,250 karod rupee ke asset kaa khulaasa kiya
 Subsequently, in December 2016, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana was launched
 iske tahat kisi aghoshit aay par 50 fisadi jurmaana dekar gopneey tareeke se isaki jaankaree sarkaar ko di ja sakati he or kisi tarah kii karrwai se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Not only this, there is also an option to invest another 25 per cent of the undisclosed income, which will be refunded after four years without interest
 notebandinotbandi se koi thos nateeja nahin mila he, ise aamtaur par vifal mana ja rahaa he
 In November 2016, the government closed 500 and 1000 rupee notes
 puure karency cirkulation main in noton kaa hissaa kareeb 86 fisadi tha
 The idea behind this was to bring back the money that was left out of the banking system
 sarkaar ko lagata tha ki isse banking system main 10 se 11 lakh karod mulya ke note waapas aa jaaenge
 a total of 15 of 500 and 1000 at the time of demonetisation
 44 lakh karod rupee mulya ke note avaidh ghoshit kiye gaye the
 Of this, only 16,000 crore rupees were not returned
 notebandi ke dauraan nae noton kii chapai or atm ko durust karne aadi par rigerv bank ke kareeb 21,000 karod rupee kharch ho gaye
 However, the Reserve Bank is not ready to give the final figures of the total amount returned to banks during demonetisation
 is tarah notebandi se sarkaar kaa yah lakshya puraa nahin hua ki arthvyavastha se kaala dhan baahar nikal aayega
 Amendment to the Benami Act: The Modi government amended the Benami Transactions (prohibition) Act 1988 in the year 2016 to curb benami transactions
 iske tahat inakam tex vibhaag ne desh bhar main 24 benami prohibishan unit sthapit kiye
 According to Minister of State for Finance Shiv Pratap Shukla, more than 1600 benami transactions worth Rs 4,300 crore were provisionally attached till June 30, 2018
 morishas ke raste aane vaale kaale dhan par ankushabharat sarkaar ne mani londring ko rokane ke liye morishas ke saath doharaa kar aropan bachaav samjhauta (DTAA) kiya tha
 Also introduced were the General Anti Avoidance Rules (GAAR), which came into force from 1 April 2017
 GAAR se bhi tex chori ke liye duusare deshon ke dwaara aane vaale lenden par roak lagati he
 On 10 May 2016, a repeat Arappan rescue agreement with Mauritius was amended
 ab sarkaar kisi morishas ke nivasee ke swaamitv vaali bhartiya company ke sheyaron se kii bikri yaa transfar se hone vaale capital gains par tex laga sakati he
 This is an effective step towards curbing black money coming from Mauritius

 In this regard, the government has entered into an agreement with Swiss National Bank on 22 November 2016
 iske tahat bhartiya khatedaar kaa acount number, naam, pataa, janm tithi, tex pahchaan number, byaaj, divident, khate main rakam aadi kii jaankaree di jaaegi
 There have been conflicting claims about black money in Swiss banks
 pehle yah aankada aayaa ki 2017 main swiss bainkon main bharatiyon ke kaale dhan main 50 fisadi kii badhat hui he
 After this, Union Minister Piyush Goyal claimed that in 2017 non-bank loans and deposits of Indians in Swiss bank accounts declined by 35%
 sarkaar ke mutabik, saal 2017 main in bainkon main bharatiyon kaa non bank diposit 52

 Due to the efforts of Modi government, the scope of income tax payers has increased and tax collection has also increased

 There were 79 crore taxpayers, which increased to 6 by 2017-18

 So PM Modi may not have fully fulfilled his promise to bring back black money, but his policies have definitely been affected

 kaise tay hota he hawaii maarg?kaise nirdhaarit hota he kisi desh kaa hawaii kshetrajab bhi kisi desh kii simaaon kii baat hoti he, tab uske simaaon main aane vaali jameen, pani or akaash par charchaa hoti he
 To understand the airspace, we first have to know the sea level
 sabhi deshon kaa uske jamini tat se 22
 2 km away is right in the sea
 ise jalseema kehete hai
 The airspace above the water and land of any country is called airspace
 hawaii kshetra kaa maalik desh yah tay karata he ki uske airspes se koun guzar saktaa he or koun nahin
 The airspace is divided into various categories based on elevation and utilization from the ground
 ye hai - niyantrit hawaii kshetra, aniyantrit hawaii kshetra, vishesh upyog ke hawaii kshetra or pratibandhit hawaii kshetra
 Air Traffic Control (ATC) is controlled by aircraft flying in controlled airspace
 ise oonchai ke hisaab se baantkar e, bi, si, di or i shreniyon main baanta jaataa he
 ATC does not give instructions to aircraft flying in uncontrolled airspace
 isamen payalat dikhaai dene ke hisaab se vimaan ko niyantrit karata he
 It occurs at a lower elevation than the ground
 vishesh upyog ke hawaii kshetra kaa upyog sena karti he
 No aircraft can fly in restricted airspace
 aisa aksar aitihaasik imaaraton or suraksha thikaanon ke upar hota he
 How to decide which way an airplane will fly between the airport when an aircraft flies is called the air route or air route
 lekin yah sirf commercial flites par lagu hota he
 Private aircraft, tourist aircraft, military aircraft fly back from one place to the same place
 ise out-and-bank trip kehete hai
 But there are some standards for air routes between airports in two countries
 pehla or sabase jaruri maanak he - duuri
 The shortest air distance from the flight start point to the flight destination is chosen
 phir dekhte he ki is maarg kaa mausam kaisaa he? hawa kii raftaar kya hogi? apatkaaleen samay main najdiki airport kii duuri kitni hogi? hawaii kshetra ke neeche padane vaale thal yaa jaleey kshetra main kisi tarah kaa vivaad to nahin he
 When the route is chosen only after all standards are met
 ye maarg kai deshon ke upar se hokar guzarate hai
 Therefore, any aircraft has to take permission from all the countries over which it passes

 ' The Supreme Court issued a notice to the Rajasthan government on the bail plea of swayambhu Sant Asaram in the Jodhpur rape case

 Suddenly, Sonia Gandhi has made her attitude related to leadership offensive
 baat chaahe koyala ghotaale kii ho yaa hinsa se nibatane main assam sarkaar ke tareeke kii, sonia puure josh-kharosh ke saath party ke bachaav kii kaman ko sambhaal rahi hai
 Look at his routine of August 28, the day Prime Minister Manmohan Singh left for Iran
 unhone subah kii shuruyaat sansad main congress sansadeey dal kii baithak ko sambodhit karne se kii or saansadon kaa aahvaan kiya ki ve ‘’uth khadey hon, laden, makasad ke saath laden or aakraamak dhang se laden
 After the Lok Sabha was adjourned, Sonia went directly to Mulayam Singh Yadav
 unke saath 10 minute tak baatcheet kii or ‘namaste’ tathaa ‘shukriya’ kehete hue baat khatm kii
 The next day the SP government of Uttar Pradesh announced 24-hour power supply for Rae Bareli and Amethi
 us din baad main jab sansad ko sthagit kar diya gaya, sonia apni aadat ke mutabik waapas 10 janpath ke apane kile main nahin gayi, balki ve central haul pahunch gayi
 There he spent an hour with Ambika Soni and other women mps
 vahaan unki lalu prasad yadav ke saath akele main baatcheet bhi hui
 Shortly after this solitary conversation, Lalu attacked the BJP, alleging that the leaders of this party had "(in bribe) taken the fat goods from the Reddy brothers
" ’’ iske baad sonia ne sapa netaa ramgopal yadav ke saath sansad ke sankat par charchaa karte hue 10 minute bitaye
 She even managed to bring a smile to the face of this low-speaking Rajya Sabha MP
 iske baad unhone party sansadeey dal kii kaaryakarini kii ek baithak main bhaag liya or lambit vidheyakon ko lekar apni chintaa jataai
 He also invited BJP MP Kirti Azad to his office in Parliament for tea
 aaazaad 28 agast ko loksabhaa main unke paas uthakar aae the or unki tabiyat ke bare main poocha tha
 Soon after, both of them started talking about 'indira Bua' (this is what Azad calls Indira Gandhi)
 is par sonia ke chehre par muskaan aa gai or unhone aaazaad ko chaay ke liye nimantran diya taaki ve baatcheet ko aage badha saken
 The Congress has never seen its leader taking interest with such activism in parliamentary politics
 isaki vajah he
 Sonia's favorite peacekeeper Pranab Mukherjee no longer exists to take over the management of the government
 unki jagah sadan ke netaa banaae gaye kendriya grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia apekshaakrit halke pad jate hai
 There is no such leader in the second line, to whom he can entrust the task of solving the problem
 is kaam ke liye unke chune gaye daavedaar rahul gandhi ne netritv sanbhaalane ke iraade kaa abhi tak koi ishaara nahin diya he
 Even on 8 August, when Advani termed the UPA government as 'illegal', Sonia took a very aggressive stance and asked her party mps to attack the BJP
 rahul us samay sadan main maujuud the, lekin party ke ekasur main chede gaye raag main ve shaamil nahin hue the
 He is also clearly quiet on the issue of coal scam
 baad main rajeev gandhi kii jayanti ke maukey par jab media ne sonia se unke bete kii ‘badi bhoomika’ kii yojanaon ke bare main jamkar sawaal daage, tab raa“l vahaan maujuud nahin the
 Sonia's questions went up on media questions and she did not respond
 congress ke ek varisht mahasachiv ke anusaar, rahul kii badi bhoomika sarkaar main nahin hogi balki party tak simit rahegi
 According to these general secretaries, "he will be given such a big post in which all the general secretaries will report to him, and Rahul will report directly to the Congress president
" ’’ haalanki ve maanate hai ki iske liye abhi tak koi samay-seemaa tay nahin kii gai he
 He shrugs his shoulders, saying, "the family has to decide
" ’’is dauraan chaahe maamla naaraaz chal rahe virbhadra singh ko shant karne kaa ho, yaa assam main raahat shiviron kaa daura karne kaa, netritv kaa boj sidhe sonia ke kandhon par aa padaa he
 The party mps who see Manmohan's falling graph and Rahul's silence get confidence from Sonia's recent enthusiasm
 haal hi main sonia se milane vaale ek loksabhaa saansad ne ishaaron-ishaaron main unki beemaari ke bare main poocha or jab sonia ne daawa kiya ‘’ab sab bilkul thik he’’ to unhen kaaphi dilasa mili
 According to a cabinet minister, Sonia has asked Congress ministers to look into the files during the NDA regime and find faults in their decisions
 unhone vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram has also asked Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Bansal to inform the Congress mps about the party's defense on the coal scam case so that they can fight the BJP in both the media and Parliament
 chidambaram ne media kii najaron se bachane ke liye congress saansadon ko koyala ghotaale ke ‘’vaastavik tathy’’ rajeev gandhi foundation main bataae
 And then UPA coordination committee meetings were chaired by Sonia and not Manmohan
 netritv kii is kahani main ek upakatha bhi he: priyanka gandhi ko haal hi main apni maa ke nirvachan kshetra ke prabandhan kaa kaarybhaar saunpa gaya he
 She meets with party workers only in a part of 10 Janpath
 maa or bahan kii ekadam se badi rajnatik sakriyata se yahi jaahir hota he ki rahul main pahal karne kaa ghor abhaav he
 There is still some time left for the results of the Punjab Assembly elections to come, but in the exit poll, the picture is visible to some extent
 jiske mutabik congress punjab main sarkaar bana sakati he
 But many exit polls are also claiming the majority government of the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab
 to kuch eczit pole donon ke bich kaante kii takkar bataa rahe hai
 But the one picture that is clear in all exit polls is that the Akali Dal and BJP are going to be clean in Punjab
 eczit pole ke nateezon ke baadaam aadmi partikheme main punjab main jeet kii ummid barkaraar he or 11 march ko hone vaali matganana kii taiyaariyon ke bich party ke andar bhi ye asamanjas hoga ki agar jite to punjab main taj kiske sar par pahanaaya jaae
 Who are the contenders for the crown? During the ticket distribution and campaigning, a picture of the famous faces of the Aam Aadmi Party was clearly visible, which could be a possible face for the party in the future
 lekin maujuuda halaat main jo chaar bade naam charchaa main hai unamem party ke sangrur se saansad or jalalabad se sukhbir badal ke khilaaf chunaav lard rahe bhagwant maan sabase pehle number par aate hai
 That is, if the Aam Aadmi Party wins elections in Punjab, then Bhagwant Mann is at the forefront of the race for the post of Chief Minister
 to vahiin doosraa naam mashhoor vakil eches phulka kaa he
 Who is a lawyer for the victims of the 84 riots in Delhi and is very close to Arvind Kejriwal
 itnaa hi nahin khud kejariwal ne khulaasa kiya tha kipunjab chunavonse pehle phulka ne hi unhen gurumukhi likhnaa sikhaaya
 At the same time, the party's third contender is Himmat Singh Shergill
 jo chandigarh main vakil hai or bikram majithia ke khilaaf chunaav lade
 At number four, the party's Punjab head is Gurpreet Ghuggi, who is also a Punjabi artist and the last name who is in the race is Jarnail Singh
 jo dilli main rajouri garden se aam aadmi party ke vidhayak rahe or istipha dekar lambi se punjab ke mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ke khilaaf chunaav lade
 The common man party can place a bet on any of these five names
 party sutron ke mutabik mukhyamantri pad ke liye aisa naam hi aage aayega jo punjab main popular ho or janata ke bich jisaki sweekruti ho
 Only after measuring on this scale will the Aam Aadmi Party and Arvind Kejriwal crown someone in Punjab

 All this happened during the time of Modi government

 Arvind Sawant announced the resignation of Arvind Sawant from the Modi cabinet after the condition of the NCP that Arvind Sawant declared the support of the Congress to the Shiv Sena; bijepi ke baad ab shivasena ke paas sarkaar banane kaa mauka he
 Equations are such that only the support of NCP and Congress to Shiv Sena can give new government to Maharashtra
 ensipi ne samarthan ke liye ek shart rakhi thi, jise shivasena ne maan bhi liya he
 In such a situation, everyone is now eyeing the action of the Congress
 darasal, 24 oktober ko aae maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon main kisi bhi dal ko purna bahumat nahin mil paaya
 BJP 105, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress got 44 seats in 288 assembly
 bijepi or shivasena gathbandhan ke paas paryaapt siten hone ke baavjood donon dalon main siem pad ke bantwaare par takaraav ho gaya or sarkaar kaa gathan nahin ho paaya
 Now the BJP has fallen alone and the Shiv Sena is expecting full support from the ncp-congress alliance
 bijepi kaa sarkaar banane se inkaararavivaar ko bijepi ne maharashtra ke rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ko bataaya ki vah apane dam par sarkaar banane main sakasham nahin he
 After this decision of the BJP, the Governor asked the second largest party Shiv Sena to form the government, after which the discussion of support of NCP and Congress intensified
 ensipi ne saarvajanik taur par shart rakhi ki samarthan ke liye shivasena ko endie se baahar hona padegaa or mantrimandal se istipha dena padegaa
 That is, Shiv Sena will have to leave the BJP completely
 ensipi kii is shart ke baad somvaar subah hi modi cabinet main shivasena cote se mantri arvind saavant ne istife kaa elaan kar diya
 In this way, the condition placed by the NCP for support was accepted by Shiv Sena
 ab congress ke haath main baajishivsena ne bhale hi ensipi kii shart maan lee ho, lekin sarkaar gathan ke liye congress kaa sahyog bhi jaruri he
 Both the NCP and the Congress are allies and the Congress is also important in terms of seats
 haalanki, maharashtra congress ke netaa or navnirvaachit vidhayak shivasena ke netritv main sarkaar ke liye raji bataae ja rahe hai
 On Sunday, former Maharashtra Chief Minister and Congress leader Ashok Chavan said that we do not want President's rule in the state and Maharashtra is in favor of a permanent government
 ravivaar ko jaipur main chunaav prabharee mallikarjun khadge ke saath baithak main congress vidhayakon ne is baat par jor diya ki shivasena ke saath sarkaar main shaamil hokar use samarthan diya jaae
 But the final decision is to take the top leadership
 sarkaar ke liye shivasena ne maani pavaar kii shart, 30 saal puraane gathbandhan ko by-by!in tamaam badal rahe samikarnon ke bich congress ne aaj varking cameti kii baithak bulaai he jo behad ahm he
 That is, now the key and power of Maharashtra's power is completely seen in the hands of Congress

 In this case, while senior leaders of the ruling BJP were accused of helping Lalit Modi at the Center, the BJP was putting the Congress in the dock by accusing the former UPA government of inaction in the case of Lalit Modi

 At the same time, when we contacted many BJP spokespersons in response to this, they refused to comment on it, while a spokesperson who did not want to reveal his name said that this is no longer an issue
