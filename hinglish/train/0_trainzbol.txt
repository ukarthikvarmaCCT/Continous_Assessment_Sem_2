 Firing continued on the outskirts, yet he did not say a word about Pakistan
 aap dekh sakate hai ki ve kis tarah nayaa agenda tay kar rahe hai
 They want to resume dialogue with Pakistan and they do not approve of any friend or foe hanging on to it
 dubai ke unke bhaashan ko dobaaraa sunen or is baat par dhyaan den ki kitni baar unhone bheed se vahaan ke “crown prince” kii jai-jayakaar karwaai
 Just think, can it be considered normal that the Prime Minister of India should cheer the ruler of a foreign country living and working with a crowd of Indians? It was no coincidence that the majority of the crowd chanting slogans praising the Islamic State was of Hindus
 yah baat alag he ki doordarshan ke camaron or modi kaa chhavi prabandhan karne waalon ne ek kone main paramparaagat veshbhusha main khadey bohara musalamaanon ko baar-baar dikhaakar is maukey ko nasht kar daalaa
 As far as i remember, there have been two occasions when an Indian leader has used the Indian mob to raise slogans in appreciation of the foreign leader
 pehali baar aisa tab hua tha jab nehru 1955 main khrushchev or bulganin ko lekar ramlila maidan main aae the
 This was seen for the second time when Narasimha Rao made a speech to Rafsanjani in Imambara, Lucknow in 1994, when Babri was injured
 donon ghatnaon ke bich haalanki ek fark he
 When Khrushchev came to India, the socialist phase of Nehru Raj was at its peak, so there was an ideological closeness between the two
 rafasanjani ke liye naaraa lagane vaali bheed main musalmaan the, yaa ve sab shiya musalmaan the
 What Rafsanjani said in his speech was, i think, the smartest diplomatic success in our history: Indian Muslims are safe in India's religious religion
 yah baat apane aap main bharat or iran ke vishisht rishte ko rekhaankit karti he, baavjood iske ki vah rah-rahakar pakistan, pratibandhon or aise hi chhitput avarodhon se prabhavit hota rahaa he
 Modi's critics complained that he had not visited any Islamic country yet
 muslim bahul aabaadi vaale desh, bangladesh yaa madhya asian ganraajyon kii yatra to thik he, lekin kisi asli islamic desh main ve nahin gaye
 They were preparing for this, but they did not have to do any work by doing so
 ve har sambhav ek ranneetik shuruyaat karnaa chaahate the
 As India's most gluttonous Hindu Prime Minister, the slogans he shouted in praise of a Muslim ruler on foreign soil from the crowd of 50,000 and most Hindus he loves, this is a proof of his strength, skill and impulse
 in tamaam shandaar uplabdhiyon ke baavjood sawaal uthta he ki unki sarkaar kaa pradarshan itnaa lachar kyon he? ganga saaf karne se lekar svachh bharat or mek in india tak unki nirvivaad or vishaal yojanaayen ladkadaa kyon rahi hai? kuch maanakon ko badalakar jis ganitiya kalakaari or nakli tareeke se aankadon ko uchhaala gaya, aap unhen ekbargi bhul jaaen to sawaal uthta he ki aarthik vruddhi main aakhir sudhaar kyon nahin ho rahaa? pradhanmantri ke do squadran rafel vimaanon kii kharid kaa teevr or taatkaalik faisla aakhir aupchaariktaaon main kyon fansaa padaa he?aakhir giriraaj singh, sakshi maharaj or gajendra chouhan jaise kuch khiske hue logon ko ve surkhiyaan batorne kii chhot kyon de rahe hai? aakhir raturaat ek adhyadesh ke raste nayaa bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon laane kii ranneetik galati ve kaise kar baithte hai? yaqub memon kii kawarej par kuch samachar channelon (jisamen se kuch to haasyaaspad the) ko notice bhejne vaali is sarkaar ke bare main aisa kyon lagata he ki usne samachar madhyamon ke khilaaf koi jang ched di ho? san samooh kaa media license radd karne ke liye unka grih mantralay “rashtriya suraksha” kaa hawala kyon de rahaa he? unki sibiai ne tista sitalwad ko “rashtriya suraksha ke liye khatre” main kyon tabdeel kar daalaa he, goyaa ve daaud kii koi rishtedaar hon? unhone agar naapsandgi ke aadhaar par ekaadh ko jail bhej bhi diya yaa kuch samay ke liye ekaadh media sansthaanon ko band bhi karvaa diya, tab bhi bhaavana ke str par ye tamaam ladaaiyaan ve haar jaaenge
 Clever, impulsive, powerful, confident leaders who are also good speakers do not waste their energy and credibility on such small issues
 kya aisa ho saktaa he ki in tamaam gunon ke baavjood unke bheetar ek aisi kamajori bhi he jo tamaam anya netaaon main pai jaati he jiske chalate ve vastav main mahaan banane se vanchit rah jate haih aise logon ko, aisi pratibhaaon ko apni ore aakarshith karne kii asamarthta, aruchi yaa phir vinamrata kii kami, jo unki raajnneeti or vichaardhaara ke sahaj daayre se kahin baahar hon? yaa phir aise samajhadaar rishayukt logon ko apane daayre main laa paane kii aakshamata jo satta ke saamne sach bolne kaa saahas rakhte hon? masalan, koi aisa shaks jo unase kah saktaa ki vah suut acha to tha, lekin use pahanane kaa vichaar bura tha
 Someone who would have told them that the atmosphere of Parliament in the monsoon session was really annoying, it would have been better if, being the leader of the Lok Sabha, they would have taken suo motu cognizance of the issues raised by the opposition
 ho saktaa he ki ve is par raji nahin hote, lekin aisa na kar ke unhone pradhanmantri ke bataur apana ikbaal jarur ganvaa diya
 There would have been someone within their ambit who could warn their Ministry of Home and Information Broadcasting not to tamper with the freedom of the media, because the government and the party are viewed with suspicion in this matter anyway
 koi na koi aisa shaks is tantra main jarur hona chahie tha jo unhen baar-baar kahata ki ramvilas paswan se bolie ki megi vivaad ke maamle main nestle par class acshan suut (saare maamalon kii ek saath sunwaayee) na daayar karen or chaiyn se rahen
 You are a powerful and sovereign government, you control Nestlé according to the food safety laws of your republic, you have laboratories, then get everything tested first and if you find anything wrong or criminal then Punish lekin class acshan suut kaa kya matlab banataa he? yah to taqatvar hone kii nishaani nahin he, mahaj bevakoofi he
 You can say where the prime minister has time
 uske paas in chizon ke alaava or tamaam gambhir kaam pade hue hai
 If this is the case, then why is your government faltering on these issues? It sounds wonderful to listen to a man's army, but you cannot win a war without putting a real army behind you

 The bank's CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar and her family are facing difficulties in the ICICI Bank loan to Venugopal Dhoot, head of Videocon Group
 is cese ke silsile main jaanch kar rahi sibiai chanda kochar ke devar rajeev kochar se bhi poochtacha kar rahi he
 However, the CBI made it clear that he was not arrested
 deepak kochar ke bhai rajivakocharaki singapore sthit is financial company avista adwyjuri sawaalon ke ghere main he
 It is alleged that this company has about 1 in seven companies in the last six years
 5 arab dollar ke videshi mudra lone ko ristracchar karne kaa kaam mila he, or sanyog se ye sabhi companiyangichhichhi bainkki bhi karjadaar hai
 In one such deal, the lead of the borrowers is bankicici
 videokon lone maamle main sibiai jald hi isiaisiai bank kimukhiya chanda kocharase poochtacha karegi
 a senior CBI official told 'aaj Tak' that the agency, which is conducting a preliminary inquiry into the loan case granted by ICICI Bank to Venugopal Dhoot, will soon record the statement of Chanda Kochhar
 chanda se poochtacha dilli main hogi, lekin sibiai isse pehle unke pati deepak kochar se poochtacha karegi
 There were reports of the alleged involvement of Kochhar and his family members in a loan case given to Videocon Group, following which the CBI started the investigation process against Deepak Kochhar
 sibiai ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki sabhi adhikariyon jinka lone paas karaane main yogadan tha, unke bayaan darj kar liye gaye hai
 Apart from this, the CBI has also seized all the documents related to this loan, which are being studied
 ab sibiai deepak kochar ko poochtacha ke liye bula sakati he
 Apart from Deepak, the CBI can also interrogate important people of Videocon Group including Chanda Kochhar
 yah poochtacha sibiai kii bank frod and security wing karegi
 However, as per the rules, the CBI cannot issue an official notice during the initial investigation, but can inquire if necessary
 praarambhik jaanch ke tahat is baat kaa pataa lagaaya jayega ki deepak kochar or unke do rishtedaaron dwaara banaai gai form ko videokon samooh ke venugopal dhoot ne rishwat ke rup main kitne rupee die
 There will also be an investigation into allegations that it is alleged that some debt assistance given by ICICI Bank to Videocon Group was lent and alleged involvement of Kochhar and some of his family members
 3,250 karod ke lone main hera-pheri kaa aropadarasal, ICICI bank or videokon group ke niveshak arvind gupta ne chanda kochar par aarope lagaaya tha ki kochar ne videokon ko kul 3250 karod rupee ke rin manjuur karne ke badale main galat tareeke se nijee laabh liya
 According to the information recorded in the Registrar of Companies, Deepak, the husband of ICICI Bank Chief Chanda Kochhar, together with Dhoot, formed a company in December 2008 in the name of Nupower Renewables Private Limited (NRPL)
 NRPL main dhoot, unke parivaar ke sadasyon or karibiyon ke 50 fisadi share the
 The remaining shares were held by Chanda Kochhar's husband Deepak Kochhar and Pacific Capital
 paisefic capital kaa swamitva deepak ke parivaar ke paas hi tha
 a year later in January 2009, Dhoot resigned as the director of NRPL and transferred around 25,000 shares of his to Deepak
 march 2010 main NRPL ko supreme energy privet limited se lone mila jo ki dhoot kii hi company thi
 By the end of March 2010, Supreme Energy took control of most of the NRPL
 deepak ke paas 5 fisadi share hi rah gaye
 After about 8 months, Dhoot transferred all his holding in Supreme Energy to his associate Mahesh Chandra Punglia
 do saal baad pungalia ne supreme energy main apana sara steke deepak kochar kii pinekal energy ko 9 lakh rupee main de diya
 a loan of Rs 3250 crore given in 2012 by Airwind Gupta told India Today, 'we need to know why Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot formed a joint venture and then Dhoot left it
 hamen jaanane kii jarurat he ki mauritian company (d rinuables) ke peeche asal main koun log hai
 The reason for Gupta's suspicion is that NRPL is getting foreign funds in abundance at the same time
 ICICI bank ne kareeb 4000 karod rupee rin ke taur par videokon group ko 2010 se 2012 ke bich die or d rinuables ne 325 karod or 66 karod rupee NRPL main daale
 ICICI Bank gave 3250 crore 5 Videocon companies in April 2012
 iske baad camen islands kii ek mukhauta company ko 660 karod rupee kaa rin diya gaya
 SEBI may also tighten the gaps: With the ICICI Bank getting involved in controversies, market regulator Sebi has started to see if there is any issue related to publication of information or company operations in this matter
 isi tarah videokon industries va iske pravartak bhi ek maamle main niamak kii nigaah main hai
 The case relates to the alleged redemption of loans given to the company by ICICI Bank and some public sector banks
 ek varisht sarkari adhikari ne bataaya ki niamak ne nijee kshetra ke is bank dwaara beete kuch saal main kiye gaye vibhinn khulaason main shuruaati jaanch shuru kii he
 At the same time, the stock market may also ask for additional clarification regarding the recent reports regarding some deals up to 2012
 ullekhneey he ki isiaisiai bank desh kaa chauthaa sarvaadhik moolyawaan bank he, jiskaa bazaar puunjikaran lagbhag 1
 8 lakh crores
 ICICI ne chanda kochar kaa kiya bachaavoichhichhi bank ke board ne apni emdi or siio chanda kochar par puraa bharosa jataayaa he
 ICICI Bank Chairman MK Sharma on Friday said in defense of his Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Chanda Kochhar that the board has full confidence in the CEO
 saath hi, unhone videokon samooh ko die lone ko lekar lagaae ja rahe aaropon ko khaarij kar diya he
 Sharma said the bank reviewed its internal procedures for loan approval and found them strong
 board is nishkarsh par pahunchaa he ki vibhinn afvaahon main lagaae gaye aaropon jaisi koi gadabadi / bhai bhatijawad / hiton kaa takaraav nahin he
 Rumors are being spread to tarnish the image of the bank and its top management

 The Shiv Sena demonstrated today with tweets from famous columnist Shobhaa Dey
 shivasena samarthak aaj shobhaa de ke ghar ke baahar pahunch gaye or vada pav baantate hue virodh pradarshan kiya
 The Shiv Sena MLA has also made up his mind to move a motion for breach of privilege in the House
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr 'saamana' main ek lekh main kaha tha ki marathi filmon kii khilli udaane vaali shobhaa de ke virodh main shivasena aakraamak hogi
 The Shiv Sena said that if Bal Thackeray had not done "dadagiri" to save Marathi culture, Sobha's ancestors would have been "born in Pakistan" and she would have joined the burqa in "page-3 parties"
 ’’shobhaa ne twit kiya tha, ‘‘main marathi filmon se pyaar karti hum
 Let me decide when and where i see him, Devendra Fadnavis
 yah kuch or nahin, balki dadaageeri he
 "shiv Sena said," Shobha's comment on Marathi culture and food is like insulting Marathi people
 unhone hamaari samskruti kaa bhi apmaan kiya he
 "in multiplexes, 'dahi Misal' (marathi food) and 'vada Pav' will be replaced by popcorn
" neeche shobhaa ke kuch twits hai, jin par bavaal machaa he
 Devendra 'diktatwala' Fadnavis is at it again !!! From beef to movies
 This is not the Maharashtra we all love! nako!nako! Yeh sab roko!i love Marathi movies
 Let me decide when and where to watch them, Devendra Fadnavis
 This is nothing but Dadagiri
 No more pop corn at multiplexes in Mumbai? Dahi misal and vada pav only
 To go better with the Marathi movies at prime time 
 It is noteworthy that columnist Shobh Dey made several tweets about the state government's decision to make it mandatory to show Marathi films in prime time in multiplexes in Maharashtra
 is par shivasena vidhayak pratap sarnayak ne vidhansabha main kaha ki upanyaaskaar shobhaa de ne sadan kii bhaawanaaon ko aahat kiya he
 Let me tell you that before the film starts in theaters of Maharashtra, it has been made mandatory to show a short film on Dadasaheb Phalke, father of Hindi cinema, and before that the national anthem will be played
 maharashtra sarkaar ke mantri taavade ne kaha tha ki vartmaan niyamon main sanshodhan ke baad yah nirnay lagu kiya jayega
 On the other hand, Information and Broadcasting Minister Arun Jaitley tried to end the controversy today over the Maharashtra government's decision to make Marathi films mandatory in multiplexes, saying that the previous state government had taken the decision ten years ago
 unhone kaha ki rajyon main alag alag bhashaaen hai or unki apni praathamiktaayen hai
 Some prominent personalities of Marathi films have welcomed the government's decision, although the views of Hindi cinema people seemed to be divided
 kuch filmkaaron ne kaha ki yah jabaran nahin hona chahie
 The opposition Congress said that regional films need cooperation, but this encouragement should not be forcible
 purv mukhyamantri prithvi raaj chavaan ne kaha ki marathi filmon ko badhaava dene main kuch galat nahin he, lekin isko lekar jor-jabardastee nahin honi chahie
 Hindi cinema filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt said that in order to remain relevant in the global world, regional identity has to be emphasized by itself

 BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi had said that the message of the party should go down that when we have joined the government, only the backward have got their rights in this state
 in dinon, bihar main nitish kumaar or unke sahyogi bhaajapa ke bich rishte saamaanya nahin rahe hai
 These days the BJP does not miss targeting Nitish in every political event
 bhaajapa kaa maananaa he ki ati-pichhadon or mahadalit voton par nitish kaa ekadhikaar nahin he
 At the same time, Ramnath Thakur, the leader of Janata Dal United, says that the BJP or Jana Sangh had dropped the government of Karpoori Thakur coming from a backward caste
 tab bhaajapa ati pichhadon kii himachati kaise ho sakati he
 The comments bataa den ki karpuri thakur ne aarakshan lagu kiya tha jisamen ati-pichhadi jati ke liye 12 pratishat, pichhadi jati ke liye aath pratishat or mahila or agadi jati ke garibon ke liye teen pratishat ke aarakshan kaa praavdhaan kiya
 It came to be known as Karpoori formula
 vahiin, karpuri formule kaa bhaajapa yaa kahen tatkaaleen jansangh ne purajor virodh kiya tha
 At the same time, now BJP leader Vikram Kaur argues that BJP had also done the task of putting Karpoori Thakur in power
 unhone kaha ki karpuri thakur se hamalogon ko koi parhez nahin tha
 The politics above led to differences and the government collapsed

 Aadhar card can not only mix the bidders through identification and eligibility for many government facilities
 aisa hi kuch hua he gujarat ke narmada jile main
 a child from Latur, Maharashtra, reunited with his family after 3 years because of the Aadhaar card
 14 saal kaa ye baccha janm se hi bol-sun nahin saktaa
 This is the story of Sanjay Nagnath Yenakur
 maharashtra-karnataka kii seemaa par latur jile main sanjay apane parivaar ke saath rahata tha
 Sanjay ran away from home after a quarrel with his brother 3 years ago
 uski gumshudagi kii report police main bhi darj karai gai
 But nothing was found out
 sanjay ghar chhodane ke baad bhatakate hue hyderabad pahunchaa or phir vahiin se gujarat main vadodra railway stesan par aa gaya
 When the police caught sight of him here, he was taken to the Narmada's Rajpipla silent deaf school
 yahaan bacchon kii padhai samet har tarah kii dekharekh kii jaati he
 He was also given a new name- 'akash'
 yahaan jitne bhi niraashrith bachche hote hai unkaaadhar cardbhi banwaaya jaataa he
 According to Chetna Parmar, District Child Protection Officer of Narmada, when the child was tried to get the Aadhaar card, the system said that it is being duplicated and in 2011 his Aadhaar card has been created
 uski ankhon ke retina or haath ke panje ke nishaan aadhaar ke record main pehle se hi maujuud hai
 Examination of records revealed that the child's Aadhaar card is already made from the address of Hanchal village of Deoni tehsil of Latur district of Maharashtra
 record main bachche kaa naam sanjay nagnath yenkun likhaa paaya gaya
 Narmada district of Gujarat is 630 km from this place
 record se pushti ho jane ke baad latur main sanjay ke gharavaalon se sampark kar jaankaree di gai
 Sanjay's family reached Narmada without delay
 teen saal baad bachche kaa gharavaalon se milan jisane bhi dekha wo bhavuk ho gaya
 This incident tells in itself that Aadhar card can prove to be a useful not only government requirement but also when the time comes

 The ministry, on advancing Sachin's name on Sachin, said that players who are currently active in the field are always likely to be selected for this country's highest civilian award in the future
 hockey ke jaadugar dhyanchand 1979 main apni maut se pehle desh kaa sir hockey kii duniya main bahut ooncha kar chuke the
 During his illustrious career, the Indian hockey team achieved an unprecedented feat of winning three consecutive gold medals in the Olympics

 barish kaa dilliwaale hameshaa se hi besabri se intjaar karte hai
 This is also the reason
 dilli main padane vaali garmi se log traahi traahi karne lagate hai or isse raahat sirf barish hi dilaati he, lekin is baar kaha ja rahaa he ki barish se dilli ko sirf bhagwaan hi bachaa sakate hai
 This is because the Delhi government has already raised its hand on the problems caused by the rain
 ye baat or he ki kejariwal sarkaar naalon kii safai na hone kaa thikra peedblyoody ke afasaron par phod rahi he, lekin ant main bhugatna to dilli kii janata ko hi he
 Now you must be wondering why we are saying this

 It mentions that the PWD drains have not been cleaned and the claims made in it are fake
 iskaa asar jaanane ke liye aaj tak kii team dilli kii sadakon par nikali

 naalon kaa overflo hona tay he
 The golden vessel near the CGO complex is full of mud
 kinaaron par kachra padaa he or bich naale main construction west bhi padaa hua he
 Meaning if there is rain, the flow of water will be directly towards the roads

 sabase pehle team aaazaad market ke najadik pahunchi
 Rani Jhansi flyover has been in operation for the last 10 years on the road there
 cancetruction kii vajah se is sadak kaa bura haal he
 Due to potholes and traffic jams, people of the area face problems every day
 halaat ye hai ki barish ke dinon main is sadak se hokar guzarana logon ke liye afat sabit hone vaala he
 According to the people passing through this road daily, waterlogging is encountered on the roads during the rainy days
 itnaa hi nahin kai baar to log jalairao kii vajah se haadason ke bhi shikaar ho jate hai
 Despite this, flyover agencies do not care about the people of the area
 ye ilaaka sadar bazaar ward main aata he
 The area's councilor Jayaprakash also believes that "the flyover work has been going on for many years, but the work has gained momentum in the last few months
" ve kehete hai ki ye sadak PWD kii he lekin unke project kii vajah se is sadak kaa kaam bhi MCD ko hi karnaa he
 There are plans to complete the work by October
 philhal monsunase nipatane ke liye unhone saare siver clin karwaane kii baat kahi or kaha ki gaddhon kii vajah se dikkat he or use bhi thik karaane kaa kaam chal rahaa he"
 Councilors claim that the sewer line of the area has been cleaned, but the people of the area say that the roads had become lukewarm due to the heavy rains that happened two days ago
 aise main log chintit hai ki kahin aane vaale dinon main barish or musiibat or na badha de
 Roads were seen at Ghanta Ghar, the road leading from Ghanta Ghar to Malkaganj, adjacent to Delhi University, remains a pond without rain

 Akhilesh Yadav, who hoped to change the party's pre-eminent image with decisions such as not to include leaders with criminal image like Yadav and Mookhtar Ansari in the Samajwadi Party (SP), has so far failed

 Therefore, even the Chief Minister cannot take a strong decision against the leaders of his party

 Disappointed among the people about Akhilesh's soft attitude, he believes that Akhilesh as Chief Minister is not able to take decisions independently

 There are allegations on Facebook that the fake news articles have a big support behind Donald Trump's victory

 If this happens and there is no difference between right and wrong then we will not know who we have to fight against and who to save
 'facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote about it on his Facebook post after watching the water go above the head
 unhone is baataa ko mana he ki fasebuk par galat news articals or afvaahen failaai ja rahi hai
 He has also said that many options have already been given in Facebook for this

 We have been seriously engaged in solving this problem since long
 isamen hamane progress bhi kiya he, lekin abhi isapar kaaphi kaam hona baaki he'mark jakarberg ne is samasya ko technikali or philosphikali jatil mana he
 Because if we removed any right content by mistake, then people will hesitate to share the content because of it
 isliye hamen isamen kaaphi saavdhaan rahanaa hota taaki ham sahi content se koi samjhauta na ho
 Founder Mark Zuckerberg has told Facebook about some projects that the company will use to rein in fake news in the coming days
 strongar ditection:iske jariye galat jaankaree ko chhanta jayega
 Through the technical system, people will be able to separate the content that has been misinformed
 iji reporting:logon ke liye kisi galat news artical ko report yani shikaayat karnaa aasaan banaaya jayega
 Third Party Verification: There are many institutes that do fact checks with which wrong information will be separated
 warning:fasebuk par share kii jane vaali story par label lagaaya jayega taaki logon ko yah pataa chale kii ise kitne logon ne galat bataaya he
 Related Articles Quality: The company will also take care of the quality of the news related to the news in the news feed
 phek news ko hataaya jayega:fasebuk se paison se judi galat khabaron ko hataaya jayega
 Apart from this, we will tighten the screws on such advertisements which contain wrong information
 sunwaayee hogi:court vaali sunwaayee nahin
 Facebook will continue to work with journalists and other news companies to focus on news facts
 mark jakarberg ne apane post ke aakhir main kaha he, 'inamen se die gaye kuch ediakam karenge or kuch nahin
 But i want to tell you that we have always taken it seriously

 12:05 AM pro kabddi lig: patna ne bengal ko 33-27 se haraaya12:00 AM neshnal herald maamle main gandhi parivaar ko raahat The Food Security Ordinance has been signed by President Pranab Mukherjee
 isi ke saath 67 fisadi aabaadi ko behad kam dar par anaaj muhaiyaa karaane kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 Since it is an ordinance, the government will have to pass it in both houses of Parliament within 6 months to form a law
 raajnneetik virodh ko darkinar karte hue sarkaar ne yah adhyadesh laane kaa faisla kiya tha
 This will be the largest program in the world under which 67 million population will be provided 60 million tonnes of rice, wheat and simple grains
 iske liye sarkaar salanaa kareeb 125 hajaar karod rupee kharch karegi
 More than the specifics of the food ordinance, its timing is being questioned
 yah upie chairman sonia gandhi kii mahatvakankshi yojana maani jaati he
 It is being told that due to this, it was hurried to implement it before the November assembly and Lok Sabha elections next year
 haalanki krishi mantri sharad pavaar isse sarkari khajaane ko hone vaale ghate ko lekar kai baar chintaa jataa chuke hai
 Earlier, media in-charge of Congress Ajay Maken held a press conference and listed the benefits of the food bill
 unhone daawa kiya ki khaadya suraksha adhyadesh lagu hone ke baad desh main koi bhookha nahin rahegaa or bacchon or mahilaon main kuposhan kii samasya khatm hogi
 He also said that the ordinance should not be associated with elections
 kya kah rahe hai baaki raajnneetik dalbijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne is adhyadesh ko raajnneetik hatkandaa bataaya he
 He said that his party wants to pass the bill but for this debate and some amendments were necessary in Parliament
 rajnath ne kaha, 'shaayad july ke tisare hafte se monsoon satr shuru ho rahaa he, phir jaldbaaji main aisa karne kii zarurat kya thi
 At the same time, CPM leader Brinda Karat has also criticized the passing of the bill by bringing an ordinance before the session of Parliament
 unhone ise sansad kii avmaananaa or aam logon se saath anyaay bataaya he
 SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, who has saved upa's drowning lutia many times by giving support from outside, has also described this bill as anti-farmer
 ye hai aalochana ke bindu1
 This will put a huge burden of subsidy on the government, which can make the fiscal deficit problem difficult
 2
 After its implementation, the grain market can be dominated by government agencies like the Food Corporation of India, which will drive private traders out of the market
 3
 Small farmers, who used to grow grains for personal use till now, may be attracted to other crops to buy subsidized grains and make money
 isse utpaadan par asar pad saktaa he

 As the nomination time was running out at 3 pm, Rajiv Shukla arranged for a chartered plane to reach Ahmedabad from Delhi
 haalanki, rajeev shukla kii ye koshishen bhi unhen gujarat nahin pahunchaa pai
 In fact, he had arranged for a chartered aircraft to arrive early, but when he reached Delhi airport, it was found that permission for landing has not been received from Ahmedabad Airport
 aisa isliye hua kyonki ahmedabad airport par nirmaan kaary chal rahaa tha or vah shaam 7 baje tak band tha

 After the attack, Mumbai Crime Branch took Iqbal Kaskar with him

 The biggest question is, who did it and why did the attack of Dawood's strongman attack on his own younger brother enter Mumbai's stronghold
 anderworld se ikbaal kaa rishta nahin he, phir bhi hamale kaa kya he makasad
 These are all such questions, which are very important to answer, because even the Mumbai Police is apprehensive that the gang-war which has been stalled on the streets of Mumbai for years may not catch up again

 com / 2xm0eisdjq dilli ke swasthya mantri satyendra jain kii mushkilen khatm hone kaa naam hi nahin le rahi hai
 The Income Tax Department has issued another notice to Satyendra Jain
 iskar vibhaag ne dilli ke swasthya mantri satyendra jain ke hawala kaarobiyon se sambandhon ke saboot milane kaa daawa kiya he
 On December 26, IT issued a first notice to Jain
 ye notice dilli meninakam tex departmentke adishnal kamishnar ne satyendra jain ko bheja tha
 The Income Tax Department sent this notice for the year 2011-12
 mili jaankaree ke anusaar is saal jain ne apni salanaa aay 8 lakh rupee bataai thi
 While investigating the department, it was found that the employees of Jain's companies had given cash to Kolkata-based Kehwala businessmen
 haalanki jain in sabhi aaropon ko sire se khaarij kar rahe hai
 At the same time, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his team are calling it a conspiracy of the central government
 duusari taraf punjab chunaav se pehle aise hi kai aaropon kii ashanka bhi jataa rahe hai
 Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that Jain has already responded to the first notice
 ab duusare notice kaa jawaab diya jayega
 The Naxalites are set to make a major reshuffle in their strategy and guerrilla warfare
 suraksha balon kii karrwai se bachane ke liencsaliapanadress kodebadalane ja rahe hai
 They will no longer wear green uniforms similar to the military so as to avoid the eyes of the security forces and carry out their activities
 yah jaankaree intelegence kii ek report se saamne ai he
 This strategy is set to be tried in all the areas where Maoism has its stronghold and where Naxalites build their bases
 ajtak ke haath lageintelligencereport main bataaya gaya he ki maovadi mahilaon or bacchon ko khufia jaankaree jutaney ke liye badi sankhya main bhartee karne kii yojana bana rahe hai
 By increasing the number of women and children, the Maoists are preparing to streamline the intelligence network in their areas
 dress bani museebatsuraksha balon kii aksar chintaa rahi he ki naksali unki tarah kapade pahante hai
 For this reason, it is difficult to identify them during operation
 pichhali kuch ghatnaon par gaur karen to chhattisgarh, odisha ke saath-saath jharkhand main kai naksali siarpief kii vardi, juute or cap main dekhe gaye the
 The special thing is that this dress is easily available in the market, which Naxalites take advantage of and use such clothes to divert the action of the security forces
 suraksha balon ne jahaan naksaliyon se khud ko bachaane ke liye hare rang kii dress par chintaa jataai he, to naksaliyon ne bhi apane kaadaron se yah dress na pahanane kii apil kii he
 The Naxalites have issued instructions to all the members except their military command that they should not wear Maoist dress
 yah nirdesh hinsak gatividhiyon ko anjaam dene vaale caderon ke liye bhi he
 The directive states that Naxalite cadres should always be in plain disguise so that no one recognizes them
 report ke mutabik haal hi main aise hi kareeb dedh darjan mahilaon or bacchon ko naksali commander apane group main shaamil kar unase surakshabalon ke khilaaf intelligence ikattha karne ke liye kaam karvaa rahe hai
 Not only this, Naxalites have also said that where the security forces are moving on a large scale, reduce their movement in the area
 iske saath hi agar gaanv ke ilaakon main naksali ladaake jate hai to vah aam aadamiyon kii tarah hi ghumen
 Such intelligence reports have been received by the Intelligence Department, on the basis of which the security forces have been alerted that Naxalites in civil dress can try to target the security forces
 isse surakshabalon ko khaasaa nuksaan ho saktaa he alert main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki aise sandigdh civil logon par bhi nazar rakhi jaae jo kisi na kisi rup main naksali ho sakate hai
 Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi has achieved achievements, but due to controversies, there have been lot of obstacles in their work
 chunaav se pehle kai muddeam aadmi party kii praathamiktaaonpar the, lekin prachand bahumat ke baavjood AAP sarkaar philhal inhen puraa karne main chook gai
 Let me tell you on which fronts the work of the Kejriwal government in the last 100 days has not been satisfactory
 1
 Janlokpaljis movement made RTI activist Arvind Jambaj leader Arvind Kejriwal, it was Janlokpal's movement
 pichhali baar isi mudde par kejariwal ne mukhyamantri kii kursi chhod di thi
 But despite the overwhelming majority this time, the Delhi government could not pass the Jan Lokpal bill till now
 alji se vivaad ke baad kejariwal sarkaar ne vidhansabha kaa apaat satr bula liya, lekin janalokapal ke liye satr bulaane kaa khyaal unhen nahin aayaa
 However, there is also a rumor that this time the party is busy in drafting the draft of this law and does not want to hurry about it
 phir bhi kaagajon par yah uski naakaami hi he
 2
 purna rajya kaa darjacendre sarkaar ke sahyog ke bina yah sambhav nahin he
 But this election promise was also from the Aam Aadmi Party, so the Delhi government is also morally accountable for it
 uski kamyaabi isi baat par nirbhar he ki vah centre sarkaar ko purna rajya ke darje ke liye manavaa le
 But no concrete initiative has been taken so far
 3
 The deployment of marshals in buses for the protection of women security women has not yet been done
 haalanki AAP netaa bahut jald ise puraa karne kaa daawa kar rahe hai, par abhi tak nateeja dhak ke paat hi he
 The promise to build a fast track court has also not been implemented
 mobile main suraksha batan dene kaa vaada bhi khub hawa main rahaa tha, lekin is bare main bhi kuch nahin kiya gaya he
 4
 sisitivi camereshaaf sarkaar ne puri dilli main dedh lakh sisitivi camere lagane kaa vaada kiya tha
 It is true that so many cameras cannot be installed in 100 days, but the Kejriwal government also did not put it in its 100-day primary initiative
 5
 The issue of free wifi free wi-fi has been in dispute since day one
 chunaav main aap ne isamen kaarigari kii thi
 The manifesto released in Hindi and the hoardings posted at the time of the election, along with the photo of Kejriwal, have said to give free wi-fi to the whole of Delhi, but the English manifesto talks about public spaces
 haalanki samaysima ke bajaay, simit data ke aadhaar par yah suvidha di jane kii yojana he
 For this, the deadline of February 2016 has been kept
 khabar he ki sarkaar nunatam 512 kebipies kii speed par har din 50 embi data kii seemaa tay karne kii soch rahi he, par abhi is bare main faisla nahin kiya gaya he
 6
 asthaayee karmchaariyon ko sthaayee karne kii maangadilli main contract par kaam kar rahe karmchaariyon ne AAP ko jamkar vot daale
 He hoped that Kejriwal would be made permanent if he came to power
 lekin ab tak is morche par bhi niraashaa haath lagi he
 7
 alji se takaravakejariwal sarkaar ne sau dinon main bijli-pani ke mudde par kaam vaada nibhaayaa he
 But in order to work, it is also necessary to maintain a proper relationship with the Lieutenant Governor
 jis tarah se dilli main adhikaron ko lekar sanvaidhanik takaraav paidaa hua he, uske baad uparajyapal or mukhyamantri, donon ko samajhnaa hoga ki vyavastha niyam-kaayadon se chalegi, kalpanaaon se nahin

 Not even Akhilesh lashed out at the rebel Hariom party president Akhilesh Yadav of the Bakhaspa

 Great Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar and former Australian captain Steve Walko are seen with great respect in the cricket world
 donon ko hi khilaadi ke taur par chalange pasand he or donon ko hi lagata he ki saal ke ant main australia daure or vishwa cap 2015 main bharat ko khaasi mushkil hogi
 In today's Conclave 'salaamcricket', both the celebrities gave their views
 salaam cricket 2014ke ‘india in australia’ satr main 'little master' ke naam se mashhoor sunil gavaskar ne dhoni kii sena ko chetavanee dete hue kaha, 'jab tak ve lagaataar 20 wicket nahin lete, tab tak ve jeet nahin sakate
 He said that he would have to take 20 wickets to win in Australia
 sunil gavaskar ne yuva khilaadiyon ko test cricket kii taraf dhyaan dene ke liye kaha
 Gavaskar said, 'if you play well in Test cricket, then there will be a worldwide name
 'steve wa ne kaha ki bharat ne emes dhoni kii captaini main bahut jeet darj kii he or australia daure par jane se pehle unamem aatmavishvaas bhi kuta-kootakar bharaa hoga

 ' purv australian captain ne kaha ki bharat ko na sirf achche gendbaajon kii jarurat he, balki use bure satr se paar paanaa bhi siikhnaa hoga
 Both the players also recalled their days when both played against each other
 gavaskar ne kaha, 'aap bhale hi takneekee rup se kitne hi majboot kyon na hon, lekin temprament ke abhaav main aap australian pichon par safal nahin ho sakate
 He also recalled the 1981 incident in which he had a dispute with Dennis Lillee
 australian daure main test ke dauraan unhen galat out de diya gaya tha or un par fabtiyaan bhi kasi gai thim
 Although he refused to repeat that language, he believed that he too had lost control of himself
 steve wa kaa kahana he ki 1986 main bharat ke khilaaf drow test hameshaa unke kariyar kaa dilachasp hissaa rahegaa
 Gavaskar said that weather will also play an important role in the tour of Australia
 unhone kaha, 'edilade or bisben main bhayankar garmi ho sakati he or aap daure kii shuruyaat kaise karte hai, yah mahatvapurn hoga
 'both Gavaskar and Waugh believe that cricket is a different level of game between India and Australia and you have to work very hard to hear the praise from people in both countries

 ' chote bacchon kii har baat kaa bahut zyada dhyaan rakhana padataa he
 Everything from their medicines to their food is given only on the advice of the doctor
 aise hi visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki chote bacchon ko mausam ke anukool or aaramdaayak kapade hi pehanaane chahie
 Let's know what kind of clothes children should wear
 
 
 1
 Wear cool cotton clothes and avoid wearing synthetic clothes during summer season
 synthetic kapadon se bacchon ko ghamauriyaan bhi ho sakati hai
 2
 dhoop main baahar nikalate samay chhotebacchon ko lambii sleeves ke halke kapadepahanaaen or sir ko dhakne ke liye cap lagaaein yaa phir towel se dhak kar rakhen
 3
 kapade kii nepiyaan shishu ke liye zyada aaramdaayak ho ti hai
 They also protect against heat and disposable nappies
 agar aapako diaper pehanaanaa hi pade to phir bacchon ko thande vaataavaran main rakhen or taapmaana ke anusaar uchit kapade pahanaaen
 4
 sardiyon main shishu ke kapade garam, naram or aaraamdeh hone chahie saath hi bachche ke hathpair garam rakhane ke liye use dastaane or mojey pehanaane chahie
 5
 bachche ko kapade hameshaa taapmaana ke hisaab se hi pehanaane chahie
 Instead of wearing a straight woolen cloth, the child should first wear a cotton cloth
 6
 Take care of the quality of children's clothes and use mild soap to wash children's clothes

 rajyon main samuchit yogyata ke bagaiyr primary skulon main aid hoque basis yani asthaayee taur par shikshakon kii niyukti ko lekar supreme court ne sakht aitraaj jataayaa he
 The Supreme Court said that the appointment of teachers in this way without full qualification is playing with the future of the country
 supreme court ke mutabik aisi niti shiksha vyavastha ko barbaad kar rahi he
 a division bench of Justice BS Chauhan and Justice Deepak Mishra, while disagreeing with this arrangement, sought to know how this policy could be taken forward after the Right to Education Act was enacted
 nyaayadhishon ne gujarat ke praathmik skulon main 'vidya sahaayak' kii niyukti se sambandhit maamle main rajya sarkaar kii yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan yah tippanee karte hue kaha ki ham aise shikshakon kii yogyata ke bare main jaananaa chaahate hai

 Pawan Hans suffered a loss of about Rs 89 crore in 2018-19, the company owes more than Rs 230 crore, while presenting the General Budget in the month of July, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman indicated the emphasis on "strategic disinvestment" of government companies 
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki sarkaar kisi saarvajanik kshetra ke company main apni samoochee hissedari bech sakati he
 In the case of Pawan Hans, a public sector helicopter company, this attempt of the government does not appear to be effective
 nahin mil rahaa dhang kaa kharidaaradrasal, sarkaar pawan hans main apni puri hissedari bechnaa to chaahati he lekin use dhang kaa kharidaar nahin mil rahaa he
 This is the reason why the deadline for filing a letter of interest (EOI) has been extended for the disinvestment of Pawan Hans for the third time in three months

 If we talk on the basis of shares, then the government has 2 lakh 84 thousand 316 shares of the company
 isi tarah oengisi ke paas 2 lakh 73 hajaar 166 share hai
 However, in July, the government issued a preliminary information memorandum to sell its entire 51 per cent stake in the company
 bataa den ki sarkaar ne pawan hans ke vinievesh ke prayaas tab shuru kiye jabaki oengisi ne pichley vitt varsh main company main samoochee hissedari lene main ruchi nahin dikhaai
 What is the point of Pawan Hans' earnings? According to the information provided on the website of the helicopter provider company Pawan Hans, the highest earnings have been made on an hourly basis in the year 2017-18
 total inakam main prati ghante ke hisaab se company ko 46 fisadi kamai hui he
 Understand in easy language, every hour Pawan Hans hired his helicopter and earned 46% of the total income from it
 vahiin har maheene ke kiraaye yaa chargees se total inakam kii 39 fisadi kamai hui he

 ' ghosh ke is bayaan ke baad bengal se lekar bijepi kii rashtriya raajnneeti tak main bhi ghamaasan much gaya
 Instead of reacting to this, BJP leaders considered silence to be appropriate but Ghosh gave the party a clarification on Sunday and saved it from being gritty

 The BJP gave nearly 50 per cent of the 11 vice presidents to backward class leaders, including a Muslim
 is suchi kii khaas baat yah rahi ki kahin bhi brahman yaa saamaanya shrenee shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya gaya, sirf pichde-daliton kii shrenee bataai gai he to kuch naamon ke saamne baqayada jati bhi likhi gai
 Actually, this time the Lok Sabha elections or the recently concluded maharashtra-haryana Assembly elections, BJP has written a chapter of political expansion
 yah bijepi kaa nahin balki ab bijepi main sheershasth netaa ke rup main sthapit ho chuke ek aise shaks kii chunavi ranneeti kaa kamaal tha jisane gujarat kaa mukhyamantri rahete hi teen saal pehle se parade ke peeche loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari shuru kar di thi
 In fact, Narendra Modi weaved a social engineering narrative that created a wave in his name in the country and he demolished all the projections and wrote a new chapter in the expansion of BJP in the Lok Sabha elections and assembly elections in two states
 bijepi ke is vistaar kii kahani main ahm yogadan pichhadon-daliton kaa hi rahaa
 According to CSDS, the leading poll analysis body, the BJP got 12 per cent more votes in the 2014 general elections than the 2009 general elections, while 19 per cent more backward classes (OBC) in the Hindi belt
 is varg main bijepi kaa vot desh ke har kshetra main badha
 On this trend, the BJP fielded the highest number of 70 OBC candidates in Maharashtra assembly elections after the Marathas, Haryana got the highest number of 17 candidates after the Jats and the highest number of votes of this category in both the states

 Govindacharya says, "BJP should not just talk about OBC for electoral politics but it has to work from the perspective of giving stability

 However, says National Secretary in charge of Himachal Pradesh Shrikant Sharma, "BJP is following Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhay

 ’’baharhaal, bijepi ke prati jis tarah rujhaan badha he, aresas use apni uplabdhi maanata he
 Sangh ideologue Rakesh Sinha says, "the work of the RSS was going very fast on the ground in this direction, the BJP is getting political benefits naturally
" ’’ lekin obisi kaa ruzan modi-bijepi ke prati prem he yaa pichhadon kii raajnneeti ke jhandabardaaron se mohabhang hone kaa sanket
 CSDS Director Sanjay Kumar believes, "parties like SP, JD (U), JD (S), RJD emerged in the last 20 years or the post-mandal era, whose base was OBC
" ye partiyaan apane-apane rajyon main sarkaar main bhi rah chuki hai
 But the experience of voters of this class has not been good
 is soch ke baad logon kaa mohabhang hona shuru hua or ye log nae vikalp talashne lage
 It was a coincidence that there was an anti-congress atmosphere in the country and people were naturally attracted to BJP
 bijepi main khud obisi kaa netritv aa gaya
 But political analyst Sanjay also believes that after the nitish-lalu alliance in Bihar, a large section of OBC returned, causing damage to the BJP
 aise main obisi partiyaan ek manch par aa jaati hai to yah varg bijepi se chhitak bhi saktaa he
 There was a time when the backward vote was polarized by regional parties to end the supremacy of the Congress, which is now returning to the national party in reverse gear
 apana aadhaar badhaane ke liye har party apane kor vot bank se itar duusari partiyon ke vot bank main send lagaakar vistaar kii ranneeti banaati he
 After the success of Lok Sabha and now two states, Bihar and UP are the major test of social equation for BJP
 bihar main party tamaam virodhon ke baavjood susheel modi or nand kishor yadav jaise obisi netaaon ko tarjeeh de rahi he
 In UP, Shah himself is moving fast towards developing backward leadership

 ’’ ve yah bhi bataate hai ki upi ke upachunaav main sapa nau siten jeet chuki he jis par bijepi ke vidhayak the or tazatreen jeet kairana main hui jo 30 saal se bijepi ke paas thi
 Certainly, a large vote bank of the Yadavs and other societies in the backward community never joined the BJP
 lekin party kii thos ranneeti kii vajah se haal ke chunaavon main bijepi ko ummid se zyada vot mili hai
 It is clear that it is difficult for the BJP to make inroads in the Muslims and it has no option but obc-dalit society

 According to Indian Express, potato is the major crop in Agra district
 saal 2017-18 ke aankadon ke mutabik jile main 57, 879 hectare jameen par aalu kaa utpaadan hua tha, isamen agra or fatehpur donon sansadeey kshetra kaa hissaa he
 Apart from this, potato is also produced on a large scale in Hathras (46,333 ha) and Aligarh (23,332 ha)
 in chaaron siton par duusare charan main 18 april ko matdaan hona he
 Apart from the low price since demonetisation, potato is also produced on a large scale in Ferozabad (48,589 ha), Kannauj (50,089 ha) and Farrukhabad (35,168 ha)
 firozabad or kannauj main 23 april ko tathaa farrukhabad main 29 april ko chunaav hoga
 Farmers are very angry that the prices of potatoes are less than the cost
 saamaanya motaa aalu ke liye kisaanon ko 50 kilo kii bori ke liye sirf 300-350 rupee, gulla aalu ke liye 200-250 rupee or kirri aalu ke liye 100 se 150 rupee mil rahe hai
 Farmers say that since demonetisation, potato is getting very similar prices
 aalu kii buvaai 15 oktober se 5 november ke bich teen hisse main kii jaati he or isaki fasal 20 farvari se 10 march ke bich milti he
 Usually, after the preparation of the crop, the farmers sell only about 20 per cent of it so that the workers can pay and save some money for their expenses
 baaki aalu ve cold storage main rakh dete hai, jahaan aalu ko november ant tak 2 se 4 degree celsius taapmaana main rakhaa jaataa he
 Farmers say that before November 8, 2016, the price of potato was getting 600 to 700 rupees per sack in the cold storage in Agra, but after demonetisation, the goods were left in cold storage and there was no one to buy the potatoes
 mote aalu ke liye 100 se 125 rupee prati bori mil rahe the, jabaki gulla or kirri aalu to koi muft main bhi lene ko taiyaar nahin tha
 The last three crop seasons have proved frightening for potato farmers
 bazaar main na to paisa he or na hi oochaal he, isliye maal kii nikasi bhi nahin ho rahi
 According to the farmers, the cost on potato itself comes from 475 to 500 rupees per bag, in such a situation, selling potatoes at very low prices for three years is proving frightening for them

 argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav id ke din ghar se baahar nahi nikle
 This is indeed shocking news
 isko lekar tamaam tarah kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai
 After all, what is the reason that Lalu Prasad Yadav does not miss any opportunity to show himself secular, he did not go anywhere in this year's Eid
 ye sahi he ki unki tabiyat puri tarah se thik nahin he, par up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav or swasthya mantri tejpratap yadav to swasth hai
 They too did not go anywhere
 duusari taraf mukhyamantri nitish kumaar id kii subah patna ke aitihaasik gandhi maidan main id ke maukey par gaye or mubaarakabaad di
 Gandhi Maidan has a tradition of offering Eid prayers for the last 93 years
 nitish kumaar pichley 12 varshon se is aayojan main lagaataar shaamil ho rahe hai
 It was Nitish Kumar who started the tradition of joining it as Chief Minister
 aaj unhone kaha ki 12 varsh kaa ek yug hota he, aaj ye yug puraa hua
 Apart from Nitish Kumar Gandhi Maidan, Khanke's Mujbiya Emarate went to half a dozen places including Sharia and greeted people on Eid
 par lalu prasad yadav is avasar par kahi nahi gaye, yah charchaa kaa vishay he
 However, he gave an iftar party on Friday, in which all the leaders of the grand alliance attended
 halaki us dauraan unke body language par media main bahut charchaa hui thi ki lalu prasad yadav or nitish kumaar aasapaas baithne ke baavjood ek dusre se baatcheet nahi kar rahe the
 The whole matter is related to the presidential election
 nitish kumaar ke endie ke ummidavaar ramnath kovind ko samarthan dene ke faisle ko lekar lalu yadav naaraaz chal rahe hai
 He had also said that he would talk to Nitish Kumar on this, but on the same day, Nitish Kumar told the media as soon as he left from Iftar that he had been fielded to defeat Bihar's daughter Meera Kumar
 halaki lalu prasad yadav ke id milan main na jane ke peeche kai vajah he, usamen pramukh he ki media ke sawaalon se bachanaa kyonki nitish kumaar ko samajhane ke bayaan par media jawaab chaahati he
 Also, after Nitish's attitude, it is clear that he is not ready to accept, in such a situation what will be the stand of RJD
 par lalu bhale hi id milane ke liye na nikle ho lekin dinabhar wo apni agali ranneeti par vichaar karte rahe
 Meanwhile, he called several leaders of the party and put a class on rhetoric
 agar aap rojaanaa kii daud-bhaag main akhbaar nahin pard paa rahe hai, to aapke liye 'aaj tak' laayaa he kuch khaas

 The film reached Bollywood last time to bid farewell to actor Vinod Khanna
 buudhvaar ke din mumbai ke varli main vinod khanna ke liye aakhri prarthana sabha rakhi gai thi jisamen puure bollywood ne apni upasthiti darj karai
 But the Bollywood actor who did all this by tweeting, he himself seems to be missing from the occasion
 ji haa ham baat kar rahe he abhinayta rishi kapur kii
 Let us tell you that Rishi Kapoor had expressed grief by tweeting on the day of Vinod Khanna's funeral that how Bollywood stars did not reach to give a final farewell to Vinod Khanna
 lekin rishi kapur ke twit ke baad vinod khanna ke prarthana sabha main amitabh bachchan, abhishek bachchan, aishwarya raay, shahrukh khan, aamir khan, maadhuri dikshit, sonakshi sinha, sonam kapur, rithik roshan se lekar bollywood kaa har bada chota kalakaar pahunchaa, lekin is maukey se khud rishi kapur gaayab najar aae
 Many stars away from Vinod Khanna's funeral, the sage said - the spooners just go to the party, although the sage made his presence the day of Vinod Khanna's funeral but the sage did not come to the prayer meeting even after tweeting
 naa to rishi or naa hi unke parivaar kaa koi sadsy yahaan najar aayaa
 Rajiv Kapoor came from the Kapoor family only on this occasion
 saath hi vinod khanna ke kareebi or bollywood ke dabang khan salmaan khan bhi yahaan nahi aaen
 Here all the stars paid a soulful tribute to Vinod Khanna
 rishi kapur ne ye twit kiye the
 
 
 Shameful
 Not ONE actor of this generation attended Vinod Khanna's funeral
 And that too he has worked with them
 Must learn to respect
 - Rishi Kapoor (@chintskap) April 27, 2017why this? Including mine and thereafter
 When i die, i must be prepared
 None will shoulder me
 Very very angry with today's so called stars
 - Rishi Kapoor (@chintskap) April 27, 2017 Yes it has been expressed earlier on social media my wife and Ranbir are out of the country
 Would never had been reason not to be there— Rishi Kapoor (@chintskap)april 27, 2017angry

 - Rishi Kapoor (@chintskap) April 27, 2017 bijepi ne emsidi kaa chunaav ladaa to sabase pehla vaada saaf safai kaa tha or janata ne is vaade par yakeen karke bijepi ko bahumat ke saath teenon emsidi main jita bhi diya
 Now it is the turn of the party, so the BJP has prepared such a plan before the new councilors formally take over, so that Delhi shines and the fulfillment of bjp's promise is clearly visible
 MCD main jeet ke baad safai par focussafai ke liye bijepi kaa mega plan he ki ek saath dilli kii sadakon par hazaron log jhaadoo lekar utren auki dilli kii safai karen
 This will send a message that the BJP is serious about cleanliness and after winning it will also be a great start to the cleanliness campaign
 iske liye bijepi ko swayamsevi sansthaaon ke prastaav bhi mili hai
 People of Dera Sacha Sauda will also help
 According to BJP sources, on May 7, the party along with Dera Sacha Sauda will conduct a mega cleanliness campaign across Delhi, in which more than one lakh volunteers of Dera Sacha Sauda will hit the streets of Delhi and also drains along the roads
 Will clean isamen bijepi ke kaaryakarta ke saath emsidi kaa puraa amala unka saath degaa
 The mega cleanliness drive in Delhi will make Delhi shine in a single day, so that BJP can fulfill its first promise after victory in MCD election
 dilli bijepi ke upaadhyaksh rajeev babbar ke mutabik agar koi swayamsevi sanstha safai main sahyog ke liye saamne aa rahi he, to usamen party peeche nahin hategi, balki dilli kii bhalaai ke liye is tarah ke sahyog kaa swaagat karegi
 After Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari had declared the cleanliness of Delhi as his first priority, after this statement, Dera Sacha Sauda chief Garumit Ram Rahim proposed this to the party and now on May 7, Delhi will be a mega cleaning Will witness the campaign dilli sikh gurudwara prabandhak cameti (DSGMC) ne karaseva ke liye apana puraa jivan laga dene vaale baba bachan singh ji karaseva vaale ko lagbhag 6 karod rupee mulya ke sona, chaandi or hira gurughar main chal rahe kaary puure karne ke liye bhent kiye

 Said to start a wing soon
 manajit singh ne bataaya ki unhone apane kaarykaal ke dauraan baba bachan singh ko unhone duusari baar karaseva kaaryon ke liye sona or chaandi saunpi
 Wherever Baba Ji uses it, it will depend on the need and convenience of the companions
 sachkhandwasi panthratna baba harbans singh ji karaseva waalon kaa bala sahib hospital shuru karne kaa sapana puraa karne ke liye cameti vachanabaddh he
 Therefore, by releasing the Bala Sahib Hospital from private hands, the committee has proposed to start it by itself in the executive committee
 baba harbans singh dwaara unke pita jatthedaar santokh singh ko 1980 ke dashak ke dauraan kahi gai baton ko bhi manajit singh ne yaad kiya
 At that time Baba Ji had told Jathedar ji, 'jathedar ji, you should get the land for the gurudhams and i will cut it down
 ' yah baat mujhe us samay samaj nahin ai thi, par dilli main jameenon kii aasmaan chhu rahi keemton ko dekhne ke baad baba harbans singh kii baat aaj mujhe samaj ai he ki baba ji ne jameenon ko sona or gurudhaamon-skulon or aspataalon ko gahanaa maanakar ye baat kii thi
 Singh made it clear that the current committee instead of spending money on gurudhams, has emphasized on the work of propaganda, education, history and social welfare
 parantu kai sthanon par sangton kii shraddha evam seva ko mukhya rakhkar sona gurudhaamon par lagaaya bhi gaya he
 In this regard, GK also referred to the service performed by a Guruprami of offering gold on the main door of Gurdwara Bangla Sahib in the past

 unhone Interstellar: My journey into Bollywood from a different planet naam ke seshan main moderator sushant mehta se apane kariyar or apni haalia filmon ke bare main khaas baatcheet kii
 Katrina was asked that you have proved your acting abilities from both your previous films Zero and India, why did you do films like Thugs of Hindostan in which you did not have anything special to do? Is it so difficult for you to refuse films despite being a superstar? On this, Katrina said that you are right and you have a responsibility to our audience
 us film ko lekar hamaara intension sahi tha
 We were thinking that this would be the Indian Fun version of Pirates of the Caribbean
 ye film kaaphi ummid se banaai thi lekin aisi filmon main kaaphi risk bhi hota he
 If it had run then it could have proved to be the highest grossing film of the year, but since it did not meet expectations, it did not do much
 lekin eemaandaaree se kahuun to maine aditya chopra ko kaha tha ki main fatima vaala role karnaa chaahati hum kyonki main us kairactor se zyada rilate kar paati hum
 He further said that Fatima was not cast till that time but Aditya told me that i should focus on this role
 maine yashraj ke saath 5 filmein kii hai
 New York, Jab Tak Hai Jaan, Tiger series, obviously i give a lot of attention to his opinion and one more thing is that i do not advise my sister in this way, but she is also going to enter films, she acted Have also done a course, so i repeatedly tell him that do not take anything personally in the film industry
 matlab chizon ko lekar zyada sensitive mat ho jaao
 Katrina further said that it is not that you stop being sensitive because after all we are human beings and our emotions
 lekin meraa matlab he ki cinema ke is bijness main chizon ko lekar sensitive hone kii jarurat nahin he or aapako kaaphi strong hona padataa he
 You always have to be ready to be ready to stand up after you fall
 isse aapaki life par kaaphi fark pad saktaa he kyonki ye profeshan bilkul bhi aasaan nahin he

 ) Apple has sent media invites for this year's biggest event
 12 sitambar ko coopertino main company ke nae headquarter jise spesship campus bhi kaha jaataa he, isamen ek event hoga
 The event will take place at the Steve Jobs Theater located in this headquarters
 yah campus company ke founder steve jobs kaa aakhri sapanom main se ek tha
 In this event, three iphones can be launched
 is event ke liye bheje gaye invite se log kai predict kar rahe hai ki is event main kya hoga
 Because the Apple logo has been given different from the traditional logo in the Invite
 logo main kuch graphics hai log ainalise kar rahe hai jiske bare main ham aapako bataate hai
 This is being interpreted more specifically on Twitter
 OLED disple or maid in americayah ajeeb jarur he, lekin aipal ke is invite main banegraphics se log yah matlab nikaal rahe hanki iphone 8 main OLED disple diya jayega
 Because if you look at the logo carefully, you will find that orange, light blue, dark blue and arcue colors have been used
 ise log OLED kaa sin bataa rahe hai
 Some users are dedicating from the colors given in it that it can be the Made in America iphone
 america president donald trump ne kai baar is taraf ishaara kiya he ki america companiyon khaskar aipal ko apane desh main product banane chahie
 This will increase employment and will also benefit
 aipal apane products kaa nirmaan duusare deshon main karata haitin modelis saal aipal teen yphone launch karegaa yah report kaaphi pehle se aa rahi he
 In terms of trade, the iphone 7s and iphone 7s Plus will be launched and since this time the company is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the iphone, a special edition may also launch the iphone X
 wal street jarnal ke tech colmist joena stern ne is logo main teen color red, white or blue kii vajah se kaha he ki iskaa matlab ye he ki is baar company teen yphone launch karegi
 New colors: It is believed that with the colors given in the logo, this time the company can bring some new colors
 iske alaava kuch logon ne ise ainalise karte hue isamen credit card kii chhavi dhund lee he or bataaya he ki credit card pe feechar diya gaya he
 What will happen this time? This time, some major changes can be seen in the iphone
 haalanki duusari companiyon ke liye OLED screen puraani ho gai he, lekin pehali baar ap is screen ke saath iphone utaar saktaa he
 The second change can be that there will be a fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone, while the facial recognition feature can be given in the front
 haalanki iphone 7s or iphone 7s plusmem bade badlaav kii ummid to nahin kii ja sakati he, kyonki ye tradishan ke mutabik iphone 7 ke apgrade ke taur par aaenge
 But the iphone 8 will get major changes including Bezel Lace Display, Biometric Scanner, Wireless Charging and OLED Display
 is event ke dauraan company apane ogmented reality se jude project ke bare main elaan kar saktaa he

 com / jelm38crw5— Alberto Bagnoli  (@bagnolimd)august 31, 2017 In Rajasthan, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party has put an issue sitting in the hands of the Congress struggling with weak conditions and thus weakened its claim of victory in the 2013 Assembly elections
 bhaajapa ke sheersh netritv main paidaa hue is vivaad se nishchit taur par bachaa ja saktaa tha
 It has revitalized the Congress
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne vipaksh kii netaa vasundhara raaje ko chetaya tha ki yadi ve nahin sanbhaleen to 'kathor parinaamon' ke liye taiyaar rahen, jiske baad vasundhara ne 5 may ko party kii praathmik sadsyta se istipha dene kii dhamkee de daali
 Actually, Gadkari wanted Vasundhara to help his rival Gulab Chand Kataria make the rally a success
 kataaria rajya ke purv grih mantri hai or un par rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa varadahast he
 The Sangh does not like Vasundhara, while Raje believes that she will be a strong contender for the post of Chief Minister upon the bjp's return to power
 vasundhara kii dhamkee ke baad kataaria ne apni yatra radd kar di
 Earlier, he was adamant about it
 iske baavjood agle do dinon main party ke 78 vidhayakon main se 56 ne or kai kaaryakartaaon ne vasundhara ke samarthan main istipha saunp diya
 This process stopped when Vasundhara asked to stop it
 party netritv ke unamem bharosa jataane ke baavjood rajya bhaajapa adhyaksh arun chaturvedi ke netritv vaale unke virdohi dhade ne istipha dene ke naatak main shaamil vidhayakon ke khilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai kar daali
 This incident decided that this unnecessary dispute, which could have been avoided, is no longer going to stop
 bhaajapa ke liye 5 may se pehle sab kuch thik chal rahaa tha
 Congress Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot was not in a good position due to poor administrative performance
 natijatan, bhaajapa ke bheetar agle chunaavon main jeet kaa bhav ghar kar gaya or iske kareeb aadha darjan vasundhara virdohi netaaon ne mukhyamantri pad par apni daavedaari thokani shuru kar di
 So far neither Vasundhara nor these leaders have been able to sit together and formulate a strategy for the party's victory in December 2013
 ek ore jahaan party kaa yah maananaa tha ki yatraaon or reliyon ke madhyam se kisi bhi ranneeti ko shakl dena bahut jaldbaaji hogi, vahiin kataaria or unke samarthakon kaa maananaa tha ki taal thokane kaa yahi sahi samay he
 Then who put BJP in this unexpected crisis? Vasundhara was disappointed that she was initially left out of planning for the visit and later asked to help Kataria, who is a contender for the post of chief minister, but is strongly opposed at the ground level
 kataaria par aarope lage ki unhone jin ilaakon se apni yatra kii yojana banaai thi, vahaan ke vidhayakon or party padaadhikariyon ko is yojana main shaamil hi nahin kiya
 Most of them are loyal to Vasundhara, who did not want Kataria's leadership to be imposed on him without his consent
 kataaria ne yatra ke poster kaa anaavaran rajnath singh or rajya bhaajapa adhyaksh arun chaturvedi se karavaaya, baad main donon ne daawa kiya ki unhen jaankaree hi nahin thi ki ye poster yatra se taalluk rakhte hai
 In the fourth week of April, Kataria realized that he could not travel alone on his own, so he sought support from Vasundhara
 vasundhara ne yah kehete hue unka aagrah thukraa diya ki unki tabiyat thik nahin he
 Protests against Kataria then intensified on a public scale when the party's national general secretary Kiran Maheshwari returned to India crying on 27 April after meeting Kataria in Rajsamand
 vahaan unhen aamantrit hi nahin kiya gaya tha
 Forced by this incident, Gadkari postponed the proposed visit from May 2 and called a meeting of the State Core Committee in Delhi on April 30
 dilli kii baithak main vasundhara or vipaksh ke up-netaa vasundhara virdohi ghanashyam tiwari ne yatra ko taal kar use diwaali ke aasapaas rakhane kaa suzav diya, jise gadakari ne khaarij kar diya
 By now, the situation had become such that other leaders, including Tiwari, who had contested the post of Chief Minister, had become frustrated with the hand of the RSS on Kataria's head
 haalanki is prakriya main vasundhara kii ho rahi kirakiri se ve santusht bhi the
 Gadkari wanted the yatra to begin from May 9 and all formalities in this regard should be settled in Jaipur on May 5
 lekin usee din chaturvedi, tiwari or purv rajya bhaajapa adhyaksh om maathur jaise vasundhara virdohi bhaajapai is baat par raji ho gaye ki yatra ko radd karnaa hoga or kaaryakartaaon ko isamen shaamil karne ke baad isaki ek nai yojana taiyaar kerani hogi
 It was also maintained that the tribals are opposing the plan to start the yatra from the Rishabhdev temple
 iske peeche farvari 2007 kii ghatana he, jab kataaria grih mantri the
 During that time, there was police firing on the tribals protesting against the occupation of the temple by the Jain community
 virodh pradarshnon kii sthiti main koi bhi bhaajapa sadsy is yatra ko kaamyaab banane kii jimmedaari lenaa nahin chaah rahaa tha
 Kataria was adamant that if Vasundhara wanted, the yatra could take place, thus indirectly accusing Vasundhara of disrupting the yatra
 thik isi mode par baithak main maujuud aresas ke pratinidhi or vasundhara virdohi captain singh solanki rajyasabha saansad bhupendra yadav se lagaataar kahe ja rahe the ki ve gadakari ko phone milaayein
 When Yadav got the call, Solanki took a call from him and told Gadkari that only Vasundhara objected to the visit and not the entire committee
 iske baad gadakari ne vasundhara par apana gussa yun nikaala, ''phir aap kathor parinaam jhelane ke liye taiyaar ho jaaie, aap jaanati hai koun ye sab chahta he
 "thus Vasundhara was not allowed to stay away from the yatra while Vasundhara said that she could not ask her supporters to make the yatra successful within just three days
" gadakari ne pehle hi yah tay kar diya tha ki yadi yatra naakaam rahi, to gaaj vasundhara par giregi
 The threat of resignation has hurt Vasundhara as her loyalty to the party will always be questioned
 istife kii dhamkee dene ke baad jab ve ghar pahunchin to unhone apane kuch vafaadaar logon ko bataaya, ''partiyaan mukhyamantri paidaa karti hai, lekin yahaan to ye use khatm karne main lage hai
 He did the same thing with Madanlal Khurana in Delhi, Khanduri in Uttarakhand and Kalyan Singh in Uttar Pradesh
 nateeja, teenon rajya inke haath se nikal gaye
 Vasundhara is the leader of the party's majority of activists and mlas unopposed, but her rival faction says she cannot win the election alone
 party 2008 ke vidhansabha or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main unke netritv main haar chuki he
 This fact led to his removal from the post of Leader of the Opposition in 2010, but the party gave him this position back in 2011
 rashtriya str ke netaa yah ghoshnaa karte rahe hai ki aglaa chunaav vasundhara ke netritv main hi ladaa jayega, lekin unke virdohi kehete hai ki jaruri nahin mukhyamantri bhi ve hi bane
 Vasundhara has been the target of her opponents since 2012 when she was given command of the party
 yahi dhada bhairon singh shekhavat kii naak main bhi dam kiye rahata tha
 He wanted the Chief Minister to come from among them
 bhaajapa or aresas ke sheersh netritv ke saamne is masale ko sulajhane kii chunauti he
 They will no longer be embarrassed by Vasundhara and cannot see the chaos of the anti-vasundhara faction, which considers itself to be above the party, which claims to be the voice of the RSS and hopes that Vasundhara will work for them

 Xiaomi apane alrounder phone redmi Note4 ko 19 janvari ko flipcart par launch karne ja rahaa he
 But perhaps cricketer Ravindra Jadeja did not like this phone
 darasal rabindra jadeja kaa maananaa he ki wo hi bharat ke leading alrounder hai
 But Flipkart, which is the official seller of Xiaomi's upcoming phone, believes that Sir Jadeja cannot compete with his all-rounder
 par aap aapako pareshaan hone kii jarurat nahin he ye koi oficial tok nahin he
 This is only part of the video made by Flipkart for the promotion of Xiaomi
 jisamen flipcart yah soochna detaa he ki 19 janvari ko india kanaya alroundrahame visit karne vaala he or poochta he ki kya aapako pataa he ki koun he wo?itane main sar jadeja aate hai or bataur alrounder flipcart ko 19 janvari ko unka match hone ke kaaran apana event ko 20 janvari ko karne ko kehete hai
 Then something happens intermittently, after some time Xiaomi removes the confusion by saying that no one is taking his place here but there is talk of his upcoming product
 aapako bataa den ki Xiaomi Redmi Note4 pichley saal agast ke maheene main china main launch kiya ja chukaa he
 It was introduced there in two variants - the first one with 2 Gb RAM and 16 Gb internal storage (which costs around Rs 9000), and the other with 3GB RAM and 64GB internal storage (which costs around Rs 12000)

 Unhappy over not being able to disguise Narendra Modi in Vadodara due to the protests, actress Vidya Balan says that she only wanted to pay respect to the Prime Minister by doing so
 baalan ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'main ise raajnneetik rang nahin dena chaahati
 Whatever happened is unfortunate
 main mahaan pradhanmantri ko unke shahar vadodara main sirf sammaan dena chaahati thi
 i did not want to hurt any feelings, so i decided not to do so
 ' National Award winning actress arrived in Vadodara yesterday for the promotion of her new film 'bobby Detective'
 vahaan unhen modi kaa vesh dhar kar ek chaay kii dukaan sahit anya jagahon par janaa tha, lekin iske khilaaf pradarshan ke kaaran vidya ne is vichaar ko sthagit kar diya
 Vidya's film 'bobby Detective' is scheduled to release next Friday

 The Lok Sabha elections are to be held in 2019, but the efforts of opposition solidarity to face the BJP have suffered a setback
 marxvaadi communist party (sipiem) ne congress se kisi bhi tarah ke talmail kii sambhaavna par viraam laga diya he
 Please tell that from 19 to 21 January, the Central Committee of CPM met in Kolkata
 sutron ke mutabik congress ke saath chunavi talmail ko lekar sipiem ke bheetar is kadar takaraar hui ki party mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ke us prastaav ko hi party ne khaarij kar diya jisamen unhonecongress ke saath talmelkarne kii baat kahi thi
 According to reports, despite Sitaram Yechury being party general secretary, the rejection of his proposal was so hurt that he even offered to resign
 sipiem ke bheetar purv mahasachiv prakaash karaat or seetaram yechuri ke bich tikhe matbhed kisi se chhipe nahin hai
 Karat, considered a 'hardliner', is said to have the support of the Kerala lobby of the party, while the Bengal lobby is said to be standing behind the 'practical' Yechury
 lekin kolkata main hui is baithak ke baad party ke bheetar ke matbhed or khulkar saamne aa gaye
 Sitaram Yechury wanted the CPM to walk shoulder to shoulder with all democratic and secular parties in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections so that the BJP can be fought
 lekin kolkata main sipiem kii baithak main prakaash karaat kaa gut baari padaa jiskaa yah kahana he ki congress ke saath sidhe yaa paroksh kisi bhi tarah se koi samjhauta nahin hona chahie
 Sitaram Yechury's proposal got just 31 votes while Prakash Karat's proposal got 55 votes
 yahaan ye gaur karnaa jaruri he ki april main hyderabad main sipiem kii congress kii ahm baithak hona nirdhaarit he
 Before that, the party's draft had to be finalized on the strategic line of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 sipiem kaa congress se duuri banaae rakhane kaa faisla sirf seetaram yechuri ke liye hi jhatka ho, aisa nahin he
 This internal arrogance of the CPM will also have a direct impact on Congress President Rahul Gandhi's strategy for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 jin sahyogiyon ke saath milakar rahul gandhi 2019 menmodi ko gherna chaahate hainvah sab baari-baari se chhitakate ja rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar, a strong leader of the opposition camp, has already joined the BJP, leaving the opposition
 uttar pradesh ke chunaav main congress ke saath chunaav ladane ke baavjood karaari haar se samaajawaadee party is kadar bidki ki ab vah bhi congress ke saath kam se kam chunaav ke pehle talmail nahin karnaa chaahati
 Congress cannot trust Sharad Pawar's NCP as NCP has contested against Congress from Maharashtra to Gujarat and it is common news that NCP is moving closer to BJP
 mamata banerjee bijepi ke khilaaf jarur lard rahi he, lekin bengal kii raajnneetik ko dekhte hue vah congress ke saath kahaan tak jaaegi yah kahana mushkil he
 In Odisha, Naveen Patnaik himself seems to be surrounded by difficulties but he would prefer to contest alone instead of going with the Congress
 mayawati ke bare main congress kii andaja nahin laga sakati ki wo congress ke saath talmail karengi yaa nahin or agar karengi to congress ko kitni siten dena chahengin
 At the time of assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, even before the Samajwadi Party had aligned, the Congress had tried to find Mayawati's mind but the matter was not made up
 tamilnadu main congress jarur ummid kar rahi hogi ki diemke uske saath aayegi, lekin karunanidhi parivaar or bijepi ke bich sudharte hue sambandh ko dekhakar congress ke netaa jarur chintaa main honge
 Leaders like Lalu Yadav and Farooq Abdullah will surely be with the Congress, but the Congress's efforts to unify the opposition has come as a big setback as the proposal against the Congress is passed within the CPM

 Significantly, on the JNU dispute, former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor had taken a dig at BJP and said that today nationalism is decided only by whether a person says 'bharat Mata Ki Jai' or not
 unhone kaha ki loktantr main logon ko jo sahi lagata he, use chunane kaa adhikaar hona chahie or dusron ke vichaaron ko sahan kiya janaa chahie
 Tharoor had said that nationalism nowadays determines whether a person says 'bharat Mata ki Jai' or not
