 anderworld don daaud ibrahim thagi kaa shikaar hua he
 Hardly anyone can believe this, but it is true
 daaud ibrahim ko usee ke ek vafaadaar gurgey ne chuunaa lagaaya he
 Lime is also not a small but full 40 crores
 ab don us shaks kii talash main juta hua he
 Underworld don Dawood Ibrahim is looking for his special henchmen these days
 us shaks kaa naam he khaliq ahamed
 According to an English newspaper, Khaliq has looted Dawood Ibrahim for Rs 40 crore
 khaliq bharat main faile don ke kaale kaarobaar main uskaa vafaadaar bataaya jaataa tha
 In fact, Khaliq used to handle Dawood's illegal business in India
 intelegence kii ek report ke mutabik, khaliq ne pichley saal dilli ke kisi vyavsaayee se 45 karod rupee kii vasuuli kii thi
 He was to send the money to Dawood
 kathith taur par khaliq ne 40 karod rupee hawala ke jariye daaud ke paas bhejne kaa naatak kiya
 Also, kept 5 crore rupees as a fee
 magar kuch vakt baad 40 karod rupee or khaliq donon hi gaayab ho gaye
 The Indian intelligence agency came to know when Jabir Moti and Khaliq, another henchmen of Dawood, were tapped
 yah donon aksar bharat or sharajahan aate-jate rahete hai
 Jabir Moti also acts as an illegal recovery for Dawood
 daaud kaa hua naam kharabadonon kii baatcheet main don ke saath dhokhadhadi kii baat saamne ai
 Jabir told Khaliq that Razzaq, another loyalist of Dawood, told Dawn about the manipulation
 rajjak ke mutabik, khaliq kii is harakat sounderworldki duniya main daaud kaa naam kharaab hua he
 According to intelligence, in November last year, the d-company had also sent two of its henchmen from Canada to Delhi
 jald paise lautaane kaa dilaayaa tha bharosaavaheen jabir se baatcheet main khaliq ne dhokhadhadi kii baat se inkaar kiya
 According to Khaliq, the money could not reach Dawood due to wrong transaction
 baatcheet main usne jabir ko vishwaas dilaayaa ki jald hi 40 karod kii rakam don ke paas pahunchaa di jaaegi
 But both Khaliq and money disappeared after that
 manipur main rah rahaa he khalikasutron ke mutabik, khaliq ke is samay manipur ke paas hone kii jaankaree mili he
 Please tell that underworld don Dawood Ibrahim has kept his black business in many countries of the world
 avaidh hathiyaaron kii taskari, nashe kii taskari, phiroti samet kai dhandhon ke jariye don ko bharat or anya deshon se hawala ke jariye paisa pahunchaaya jaataa hai
 Dawood's passages near Dawood reach Dawood through hawala by depositing black business money from several states including Delhi, Mumbai in India and sending that money to Don in Panama, Dubai, Canada and Pakistan
 philhal most wanted don daaud ibrahim khaliq kii talash main hai
 At the same time, this incident of cheating the don of 'd-company' remains a matter of discussion in the underworld

 5 / 5 aflatoon kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay main chaatr netaa rahe hai or samaajwaad, maanavadhikaar or chaatr raajnneeti par unki apni soch he
 He is the grandson of his personal secretary Mahadev Desai, who wrote the diary of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi
 mahadev desai ko mahatma gandhi putravat maanate the or unka nidhan bhi mahatma kii ankhon ke saamne 15 agast 1942 ko aagaa khan palace main hua tha
 It was not the palace but the temporary prison where he was lodged with Bapu
 baapu se unki atmiyata kaa anumaan isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki mahadev desai ke nidhan ke baad unki samadhi baapu kii ichha par usee jagah banaai gai
 a year later, when Ba Kasturba died, his tomb was also built next to the tomb of Mahadev Desai
 mahadev desai ke bete or aflatoon ke pita narayan desai kaa bachapan bhi baapu ke saath hi beetaa
 He grew up in Sabarmati Ashram
 vah khud bhi ek jane-maane gandhivadi rahe
 Apart from the chancellor of Gujarat Vidyapith, he helped in the opening of many educational institutions
 unhone ek vidhyalay bhi sthapit kiya tha
 Apart from this, Narayan Desai was also famous for starting the song 'gandhi Katha' in 2004
 vah vinoba bhaave ke 'bhudaan andolan' or jaiprakash narayan ke 'sampurna kranti' se bhi jude the
 Aflatoon is his younger son
 vah apane naam ke saath desai nahin lagaate or unhen yah pasand nahin ki unhen unke parivaar ke chalate janaa jaae
 Despite that he had all the opportunities for a big job, he also lived in Kashi and continued his family's tradition dedicated to the upliftment of society
 vasant panchami ko kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay ke sthapana diwas ke maukey par likhi gai unki yah post 'yahi he vah jagah' naamak unke blog lee gai he
 *** Kashi University is the place where it does not come to be known as the spring festival, we come like Omar, goes in the eyes with eyes, goes silently as the market passes by the unemployed remains like a shopkeeper
 Flowers are loaded with lions
 This time, when spring comes, stop giving it to me
 Increased business of red lace Our victory stuck in the crackdown - the voices of heavy boots, exercising on the indefinite bandhjiej of the defeatists, the torn pages of the future This time when spring comes, just stop it, like the falling leaves
 are, lowesant ayathitkachala gayaor patharav main ulajh gaye hamaare haathphir unahattaraveen baar!kisne sochaa thaki hamaare phenke gayi pattharon sedekhate - dekhatekhadi ho jaaegi ek diwaraur phirmanch kii tarah chaudee 
 People standing on it can also turn around and turn back, it is also necessary to collapse this wall to get out of a very tight tunnel, which gets trapped in a dwarf day and night
 kitabon ke andhere menlalipop chusane main maganahamen yah bounapandikhai nahin degaa
 But like a relentless challenge, like a chasing chant, our age will be heard again and again, that from this darkness, get out of the tunnel, break the crack of the wall
 or iske liephilhal sabase zyada munasibyahi he vah jagah
 - Rajendra Rajanavasantotsavam does not come here in an unbeatable manner
 1916 main vasant panchami ko is vishvavidhyalay kaa sthapana hui thi
 In this way Vasantotsav is the foundation day here
 sthapana diwas ke din chaatr-chatraayen alag-alag vishay chun kar juluus kii shakl main jhaankiyaan nikaalte the
 But now it is not so
 kyon? saal 1986 kii baat he
 It happened that in the tableau of Foundation Day that year, the students of Acharya Narendra Dev Hostel, who were fixed for graduate students of the Faculty of Social Sciences, had chosen the exam as the subject of graduation for their admission
 is jhaanki main ek trek par vishvavidhyalay kaa singhdwar bana
 The gate had two parts
 gramin prishthbhumi ke chaatro ko bhaga diya ja rahaa tha or shahari prishthbhumi ke koching, quiz ke abhyast bacchon kaa swaagat kiya ja rahaa tha
 It is a fact that after the admission started through the entrance examination based on the central board syllabus, students who have done well in their board examinations of eastern Uttar Pradesh and western Bihar also started getting trimmed and the syllabus of the central board of industrial cities The children grew up
 par sthapana diwas kii jhaanki par us varsh barbar police daman hua
 
 
 Now the tableaux do not come out on the foundation day
 chaahe jo kahen sabase yaadgaar or aitihaasik sthapana diwas to pehla hi rahaa hoga
 In addition to Viceroy Lord Hardinge and British officers, the founder of the university, Mahamana Pand Madan Mohan Malaviya, had also invited dignitaries like Mahatma Gandhi, Chandrashekhar Raman
 gandhi ji kaa aitihaasik vaktavy hindi main hua
 Many rulers who donated Mahamana for the university were seated with jewelery
 gandhi ne un par bebaak tippanee kii
 Listening to that speech, Vinoba Bhave had said that 'the thoughts of this man are in harmony with the peace of the Himalayas and the revolution of Bengal'
 lohia ne bhi us bhaashan kaa aage chal kar apni kitaab main zikr kiya
 Since then, no one knows how many places, how many times, in how many books, in how many languages has Gandhi's speech been mentioned
 mahatma gandhi ek varsh purv hi dakshin africa se laute the or bharat kii jameen par pehla satyagrah ek varsh baad champaran main hona tha
 It was the vision of 'malaviyaji Maharaj' (gandhiji used to call him) that he recognized the future leader and called him
 gandhiji ke us bhaashan se raaje-maharaajaaon ke alaava dow
 Annie Besant was also angry
 mahatma ne apane us bhaashan main visarai lord harding ke aagaman kii taiyaari main shahar ke chappe-chappe main khufia tantra ke bichaaye gayi jaal, vishwanath mandir kii gali kii gandagee aadi kaa bhi ullekh kiya tha
 But what he said about higher education was, "I hope that this university will manage that the young men and women who come here to study, get education through their mother tongues
" hamaari bhashaa hamaara apana pratibimb hoti he
 And if you say that languages are unable to reveal the best ideas, then i would say that the sooner our existence is erased from this world, the better
 kya yahaan ek bhi aisa aadmi he, jo yah sapana dekhtaa ho ki angreji kabhi hindustan kii rashtrabhasha ban sakati he? ('kabhi nahin' kii awaajen) raashtra par yah videshi madhyam kaa boj kis liye? ek kshan ke liye to sochie ki hamaare ladakon ko har angrej ladke ke saath kisi asmaan daud daudani padati he
 "the poem written by Rajendra Rajan was first published in the booklet
 'kitabon kii ek anischitkaaleen bandi' ke dauraan
 The cooperation amount of the prescription was 20 paise
 mere jhole main kareeb battis rupye sikkon main the, jab us parche ko bechate hue main giraftaar hua tha
 Since it was 'news' for the then crisis of the university, the news magazine 'maya' printed it in a separate box, with references
 'maaya' main vaise kavita nahin chhapati thi
 Rajan dedicated this poem to his comrades of Samata Yuvajan Sabha
 rajendra rajan kishan patnayak ke sampaadakatv me chhapane vaali 'samayik vaarta' ke sampaadan se lambe samay tak jude rahe
 Was also in the editorial department of a newspaper

 Manmohan Singh targeted the BJP and its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 iske alaava piem ne kaha ki chhattisgarh main vikaas kam hua he, jisaki vajah unhone rajya sarkaar ko bataaya
 The PM also mentioned the Central Government schemes
 dow
 Manmohan Singh was addressing a rally in Raipur on Saturday
 unhone modi kaa naam liye bina kaha ki bade manch se baaten karne se satta nahin milti
 This requires hard work and work
 chhattasigarh main suraksha vyavastha chaupat ho chuki he
 The state government has failed to provide security
 singh ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar kii naakaami ke chalate hi naksaliyon ne chhattisgarh congress ke kai 'mahaan' netaaon kii hatya kar di
 Congress leaders will never bow down to Naxalites
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki upie ke shashan main sabase zyada vikaas hua he or unki sarkaar chhattisgarh main vikaas ke liye centre patibaddh he
 Singh said that the opposition parties are making various claims
 bijepi ke kai netaa itihaas-bhugol tak badal dete hai or vikaas ke bare main galat aankade pesh kar rahe hai
 Now the public has become sensible and is not going to fall into their trap
 pradhanmantri ne apane bhaashan main haalanki narendra modi kaa naam to nahin liya lekin ishaaron main hi nishaanaa jarur saadhaa
 Singh said that for the moment there is a need to be vigilant with communal forces
 ye takatein jhooth bolkar satta hathiyaane kii koshish main hai
 Manmohan Singh said that he called upon the people of Chhattisgarh to vote for the Congress so that there can be better development in their state
 abhi tak chhattisgarh kaa vikaas nahin hone ke peeche rajya kii bijepi sarkaar kii laaparvaahee or gairjimmedaari rahi he
 The PM referred to the achievements of the UPA government
 singh ne kaha ki upie ke rahete prati vyakti aay badi he
 There is a lot of progress in the field of education
 upie ne bacchon ko dopaher kaa khaanaa dilaane kaa kaam kiya he or swasthya seva kaa vistaar kiya he
 Apart from this, Manmohan Singh said that farmers have benefited from the Land Acquisition Act

 Even though his pen may not be that fine, his language will not be as bright
 uske paas vah peshewar taraash nahin hogi, jo kisi khabar main aakrosh bhi paidaa karti he or kisi mujrim ke liye batch nikalne ke liye sooraakh bhi chhod detii he
 He wrote the scam of someone directly, he wrote the rape directly as the scam, he named the allegations
 yah bahut himmat kaa kaam he
 Nobody shows this courage in our time

 He was threatened, burnt
 usne marane se pehle magistrate ke saamne bayaan diya

 He is surrounded by several charges - including now a murder charge - a minister is seen

 But for those who think of themselves as vips, big journalists, who think that in the illusion of their contacts that no one can spoil them, there is a lesson in this death

 It is a work of great courage
 yah himmat hamaare samay main koi nahin dikhaata
 He showed up and was told his status
 use dhamkee di gai, use jala diya gaya
 He made a statement before the magistrate before he died
 fasebuk par apane zakhmon ke bare main likhaa, lekin kanoon apana kaam kar rahaa he
 He does not even see the statement made before his death
 use kai aaropon se ghira- jinamein ab ek hatya kaa aarope bhi shamil he- ek mantri dikh rahaa he
 The cruel and shameless power that saved him is seen
 yani kaanoon sabakuch dekh rahaa he, vah kitaab nahin dekh rahaa jiskaa naam bhartiya dand samhita he
 He will not see, because we are not watching
 tippaniyan In our eyes, he is also a minor journalist who was killed because he crossed his Lakshmanrekha
 usne patrakarita ke qaayadon par amal nahin kiya
 In the country in which all types of criminals roam freely, he died a torture death
 lekin jo log apane-aap ko viypi samajhate hai, bada patrkaar samajhate hai, jo apane samparkon ke bharam main ye sochate hai ki unka koi kuch bigaad nahin saktaa, unke liye is maut main ek sabak he
 He will be killed the day he tries to remove the mask of power
 50 baras pehle muktibodh ne likhaa tha, hai-hai maine usko nanga dekh liya he, isaki mujhe sazaa milegi, zarur milegi
 In our time, it is dark and dense and vast - a slight death is testifying to this

 'ab 4 saal se adhik umr ke bacchon ko bhinursery main daakhilamilegaa
 In the earlier hearing also, the court had asked the Delhi government from where they got the right to set the maximum age limit for nursery admission in private schools to four years
 court ke mutabik dilli sarkaar kii adhisuchana ko kanoonee manyata praapt nahin he
 Stories that complete the cycle of time are often very inspiring and stimulating
 khun, pasinaa, safalataa, gaurav, bikhri ummiden, toote sapane, jaag-jaag kar bitaai hui raaten
 From the 2011 Lord's Test in England to the 2014 Lord's Test, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team had seen a lot of ups and downs with the top seed and losing
 bharat ko videshi dharti par lagaataar haar kaa munh dekhnaa pad rahaa tha
 England, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand had to face mouths everywhere
 jaahir he, team ko tikhi aalochanaayen jhelni pad rahi thiah valrd cap champion ipiel kii daulat ke bhukhe, tii20 khilne ke aadi khiladinnon main test cricket khilne kaa dhairya nahin, ballebaajon ko short genden khilne se dar lagata he, madhyam gati ke tej gendbaaj phiseddi sabit ho rahe hai, team mushkil daur se guzar rahi he, rakshaatmak or nakaaratmak ravaiye vaala captain jimmedaari se bhaag rahaa he
 It seems that the captain is not aware of the basics of Test cricket: to get a chance to win you have to be ready to lose
 ye sari baaten sach thim
 Russo 2011
 johanisburg 2012
 Wellington 2013
 kya dhoni kii captaini main bharat ek baar phir videshi dharti par test match jeet saktaa he?ek baar phir england kii vahi dharti thi
 On which the team was reborn as the winner
 21 july, 2011 ko patan kii ore badaae kii shuruyaat karne ke thik teen saal baad bharat ne 21 july, 2014 ko 82 varshon main lodrs par ab tak kaa doosraa test match jitkar chamatkaar kar diya
 In these three years, India has tasted defeat 10 times, has been on par three times and could not get a single victory outside the country
 janvari, 2010 se june, 2014 tak bharat ne upmahadweep se baahar kul 22 test match khele, jinamein use sirf chaar maichon main jeet mili
 At a time when Dhoni's players needed to improve India's record on foreign soil, he went into sleep and opened his eyes, he was in the nightmare of the 1990s, when India played 39 Tests abroad and He had won just one match in Sri Lanka
 ab jaraa isaki tulana 2001 main kolkata main australia ke khilaaf ve
 V
 es
 Laxman's 281 runs from the historic innings era
 2000 se 2010 ke bich bharat ne kul 56 test match khele the, jinamein usne 19 maichon main jeet hasil kii thi or 18 match barabari par chute the
 Now you can understand the frustration
 west indies, dakshin africa or newjiland main jeet kaa mauka haath main aane ke baavjood bhartiya captain or coach dancan flechar ne jeet kii koshish chhod di or rakshaatmak khel par utar aae
 He started trying to stop the run instead of taking wickets by spreading fielders in the field or giving up trying to chase the target and came back to save the wicket
 vah team jo apni sapaat pichon par virdohi tiimon ko haraane kaa gaurav hasil karti rahi he, vah 2012 main apane hi maidan par england se haar gai
 The curator, who prepared the pitch, had prepared a pitch at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, which is considered as the Lord of India, to help the Indian bowlers
 lekin graham swaan or monti panesar ne uskaa phayda uthaa liya
 The 2‚Äì1 defeat was further aggravated by Dhoni's statement that he said the loss was no more painful than being eliminated in the first round of the 2007 World Cup
 yah bayaan saaf bataata he ki bharat test match ko kitni praathamikta detaa he
 Now, in less than two years, India has finally shown England how painful it is to experience losing at home
 england ke ballebaaj ek-ek karke eshanth sharma kii short pich gendon se bachane kii koshish main out hote ja rahe the
 The special thing about this story of avenging the defeat is that this feat was done under the captaincy of the person who was constantly criticized that he proves to be a laggard on foreign grounds and he has no strategy
 saath hi team main ek aisa gendbaaj he, jiske bare main twitor par test viketon se zyada chutakle padhgaye ko milte hai
 Even more shocking was that even the English media did not hold back from reminding us that even after falling seven wickets for 128 runs, the figure of 150 cannot be touched
 yah test aasaani se england ke paksh main ja saktaa tha kyonki lodrs kii pich england kii tej gendbaaji ke liye zyada madadgaar ho sakati thi
 Earlier in the summer, it was designed according to the host team's mind after complaints of making subcontinent-like pitches in a Test match against Sri Lanka and against India at Tent Bridge
 iske baavjood bharat ne dikhaa diya ki vah aisi pich par bhi 295 ran banane kii takat rakhata he
 It is still early in the five-test series, but Team India has received accolades from two of its first citizens: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took to Twitter to praise, and Sachin Tendulkar
 videshi maidaanon par test maichon main bharat kii jeet itani durlabh hoti he ki use dilo-dimag main sanjokar rakh liya jaataa he
 Tendulkar understands the importance of winning these Test matches the most because in his long career of 24 years he has tasted only 20 such victories
 isaki tulana jaraa riki ponting se kiijie
 He has won 37 matches in a career of 15 years
 lodrs 2014 kii kuch khaas yadeh pehle din cheteshwar pujaara kaa teen ghante tak tikaa rahanaa, ajinkya rahane kaa shandaar shatak, bhubaneshwar kumaar kaa ardhashatak, murali vijay ke dhairyapurvak banaae gaye 95 ran
 On every individual achievement, the presence of Indians in Lord's balcony, Ravindra Jadeja's deliberately made half-century and fencing, Dhoni's joyous swing after victory, which was contrary to his nature
 har wicket ke saath eshanth kaa badhata aatmavishvaas or aakraamak andaaj, jadeja ke haathon jimi anderson ko ran-out karne ke baad mohammad shami kaa eshanth sharma ko 74 ran dekar 7 wicket dilaane vaali gend pesh karnaa, lodrs ke sammaan manch ke saamne bhuvi or rahane kaa bacchon kii tarah ankhen fadkar dekhnaa, england kii haar ke baad jadeja kaa anderson se haath milaanaa, eshanth sharma kaa sammaan
 Prior to this, Test matches of Headingley in 2002, Adelaide in 2003, Multan and Rawalpindi in 2004, Johannesburg in 2006, Nottingham in 2007, Perth in 2008 and Durban in 2010 will always be remembered
 yah samajhane ke liye ki lodrs 2014 kaa test khaas kyon he, aapako is milinium kii shuruyaat ke samay bharat ko videsh main mili jeet ko yaad karnaa hoga
 Between 2002 and 2008, Anil Kumble played in 14 matches in a total of 17 wins abroad
 us samay anil kumble bhartiya gendbaaji kaa mukhya hathiyaar the, jinhen jahir khan, irfan pathan or srisanth jaise tej gendbaajon kaa bharpoor sahyog miltaa tha
 These were not bowlers who could bowl opposing batsmen with their short balls
 unke shikaar reverse swing par banate the
 Also, Tendulkar, Laxman, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly used to contribute a lot
 lekin videsh main mili jeet par kumble ke yogadan ke bare main zyada kuch nahin kaha jaataa he
 Returning to Lord's 2014, has India really found a way to rise above the abyss, or are we once again overjoyed at the victory abroad? However, we must think positively and appreciate Pujara's prudence, Bhuvi's performance with the bat and ball, Vijay, who played well on a flat wicket, patiently skipped 150 balls while skipping 150 balls
 lekin england kii maujuuda team is samay zyada majboot nahin maani jaati he
 She has recently lost to Sri Lanka on her own ground
 yah team bikharane kii kagaar par he, jiskaa captain alavida kehane vaala he
 This is the first chapter of India's return
 abhi teen match baaki hai
 Will Dhoni's team retain their lead and win the series overseas for the first time since victory over the West Indies in June 2011
 If the team could do so, it would be a quantum leap for India

 The protest against the rape of a 5-year-old boy in Gandhinagar, Delhi, was just about to fire when another girl in Bhalswa in the capital came to know about the situation
 'gudiya' kaa gunahagaar police kii giraft menek darinde kii haivaaniyat kii shikaar hui 'gudiya' ke liye puraa desh khadaa ho gaya
 How many of those horrific 40-year-olds would have spent that dreadful 40 hours in torture, how much they would have been tortured and how much they would have screamed
 darinde ne uski chikhen dabaane kii koshish kii hogi to us vakt us par kya beeti hogi
 Thinking these embers flare up in every eye
 gudiya kaa gunahagaar police kii giraft main he, samaaj baichaiyn he jo sadakon par aakar apana aakrosh jaahir kar rahaa he
 Which society have we given to our girls? hamane apni betiyon ke liye ye koun sa maahaul bana rakhaa he, jahaan bacchee na to ghar main or na hi sadak par mahfuj he
 The country is boiling, but the Havans have no effect
 gudiya se darindagi ke virodh kii aag abhi dadhak hi rahi thi ki dilli ke bhalswa main ek or bacchee se haivaaniyat kii daastaan saamne aa gai
 Rickshawale made innocent a victim of lust a drunk rickshawler in Bhabhalswa made an 8 year old innocent a victim of his lust
 gussaye logon ne aaropee rickshawvaale ko peet-petakar police ke hawaale kar diya
 When the Delhi Police refused to write the report, people demonstrated fiercely here

 lekin kuch maamle aise hote hai, jinhe aksar yaad kiya jaataa he
 The reason for missing them is their complexity
 kyonki wo maamle police ke liye chunauti ban jate hai
 One such case came up last year
 jab bihar ke danapur se new jalpaigudi ja rahi capital express se ek vivaahita rahasyamay tareeke se gaayab ho gai thi
 Both the husband and wife boarded the train from Rajendra Nagar, but the wife had disappeared from the train as soon as she reached Mokama
 chuttee manaane ja rahe the pati-patnimamla lagbhag salbhar purana he
 It is May 2016
 bihar kii rajdhani patna ke patrkaar nagar thana kshetra nivasee bank adhikari tathagat kii shaadi teen varsh purv shivpuri nivasee smita ke saath hui thi
 At that time Tathagata was the manager of a branch of Allahabad Bank in Gonda district of UP
 may ke ant main tathagat ne apni patni smita ke saath baahar jane kaa program banaaya
 He was going on a holiday with his wife Smita to Darjeeling
 yatra ke liye unhone train chuni
 Husband-wife reservation was done in the A-1 coach of the Capital Express train
 unke liye coach main berth sankhya 33 or 35 arakshit the
 Caught to go to Darjeeling, preparations to get the train were completed
 tathagat bhi khush the ki chalon kuch din kaam se fursat mil jaaegi
 The luggage was packed
 donon samay se patna ke rajendranagar railway stesan pahunch gaye the
 Then both of them boarded the Capital Express train
 train platform chhod chuki thi
 It was night time, so people started preparing to sleep in the train
 train chalane ke kuch der baad tathagat berth sankhya 33 par or smita berth sankhya 35 par pahunch gaye
 After some time, Tathagata fell asleep
 is dauraan smita bhi so gai thi
 The train was running on ragged tracks
 chalati train se gaayab ho gai thi mahilachanak mokama main tathagat kii neend khuli
 He noticed that Smita was not in her seat
 unhen laga ki shaayad wo washroom gai hogi
 After waiting for some time, Tathagata started searching for his wife in coach but could not find her
 20 se 25 minute ho chuke the, smita kaa kuch pataa nahin tha
 Troubled, Tathagata inquired about Smita from the staff of the train to the passengers but no clue was found
 tathagat bahut pareshaan tha
 He could not understand where Smita went
 katihaar main darj karaayaa tha maamlatrain phir se patariyon par daud rahi thi
 Tathagata searches for Smita in the entire train but cannot find it
 train katihaar tak pahunch chuki thi
 Tathagata's courage had answered
 usne vahiin train chodi or sidhe rail thane kaa rukh kiya
 He reached the police and told the whole scene
 uski baat sunakar police vaale bhi hairaan the
 The police had registered a report of the woman's disappearance
 tathagat lagaataar smita kaa phone mila rahaa tha
 But his mobile phone was also coming off after he disappeared
 police bhi mobile number ke aadhaar par smita kii lokation tres karne main lagi thi
 Various speculations were being made about the incident of sudden disappearance of the married woman from the moving train
 ab tak yah khabar tathagat ne donon apane or smita ke parivaar ko bhi de di thi
 Everyone wondered where Smita disappeared
 pita ko kiya phone, bataai dil kii batkatihaal main railway police ke paas maamla darj ho jane ke baad smita kii talash ke liye team banaai gai
 The police was investigating the case from every possible aspect
 puraa din bitne vaala tha
 The matter had also come in the media headlines
 har taraf smita ke gaayab ho jane kii charchaa thi
 Some were anticipating his kidnapping, while some were talking about an accident
 isi bich maamle main ek nayaa mode us vakt aayaa, jab train se gaayab hui bank afasar kii patni smita ne apane pita ko phone kiya
 He told his father on the phone that he was safe
 lekin vah apane pati tathagat ke saath nahin rahanaa chaahati thi
 Smita wanted to break away from her husband, as soon as the father got a call from Smita, the family took a sigh of relief
 police ko bhi is bare main jaankaree de di gai thi
 Katihar Rail SP himself came forward and told the media that Smita is safe
 jald hi vah apane pita ke ghar pahunch jaaegi
 The SP revealed that Smita had also called her father to talk about being safe himself
 iske baad maamle kii chaanbin karne vaali police team ne smita se baat kii or uskaa bayaan liya
 The police came to know that Smita herself was unhappy with Tathagata
 vah usase alag hona chaahati thi
 Meanwhile Tathagata made up his mind to go on vacation
 lekin smita janaa nahin chaahati thi
 Still he was forcibly taking her along
 donon train main savaar ho chuke the
 But Smita did not mind
 jab tathagat so gaya to vah agle stesan par chupchaap train se utar gai thi
 After this, after several hours, he called his father and reported that he was safe
 gharelu vivaad tha mahila ke jane kii vajahdonon ke alag ho jane ke peeche gharelu vivaad bataaya jaataa he
 But the police also got upset in this case which lasted 24 hours
 kyonki na to smita kii koi lokation mil rahi thi or na hi koi aisa shaks jisane smita ko aakhri baar train se jate hue dekha ho
 Tathagata also never thought that in the midst of this, his wife would leave him and disappear somewhere
 yah puraa maamla ek june 2016 ko media kii surkhiyon main chaaya rahaa tha

 skool main padhai ke dauraan aise kai niyam hote hai, jinhen ham todate he or jo nahin tod pate unhen todane kaa puraa mauka talash karte rahete hai
 We tell you which are the rules of school time, those selected rules: Uniform: Going to school for the same dress everyday is not less than a punishment
 kai baar ham sochate hai, is niyam ko badal dena chahie lekin aaj bhi yah niyam barkaraar he
 Moving freely: The more freedom there is, the greater the desire for freedom
 aisi hi ek aazaadee skool main padhane ke dauraan ham paanaa chaahate hai
 Where no one stops or interrupts, just roam from one class room to another
 jab dil karen field main daud lagane pahunch jaaen or jab dil karen class main padhane aa jaaen
 Eating while sitting in the class room: No matter how many stomachs reach the school from home, but as soon as they reach the school, the rats start jumping in the stomach due to hunger
 bhukh khaastaur se tab jarur lagati he jab teacher padhaa rahi ho
 In such a situation, the pleasure of eating food stolen by taking the hand bag under the table and taking it out of the bag is so much that don't ask
 skool se chuttee:class banks maar kar skool ke baahar ghoomana to skool life main har student apana adhikaar samajhataa he, lekin chuttee aasaani se to milane se rahi, lihaaja pet dard kaa bahaanaa sabase parfect lagata he
 This excuse can also be used at times, but at times a lie is punished

 kendriya vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram presented the 82nd General Budget of the country in Parliament on Thursday
 yah unka apana aathvaan bajet he, jo purv pradhanmantri morarji desai dwaara ricard 10 baar prastut kiye gaye bajet se do kam he
 After attaining independence in August 1947, 25 ministers have held the finance charge in the country so far
 is dauraan 81 baar bajet pesh kiye gaye, jinamein se 65 saadhaaran salanaa bajet the, 12 antarim bajet the or chaar vishesh avasar ke bajet the, jise chota bajet bhi kaha jaataa he
 Finance Minister p Chidambaram will present the last general budget of the UPA-2 government today
 2014 chunaavon ke maddenjar vittamantri pi chidambaram par loklubhaavan bajet pesh karne kii chunauti he to khastahal arthvyastha ko patari par laane ke liye kathor faisle bhi jaruri he
 The biggest question is how will the finance minister be able to ride two boats simultaneously
 jis bajet se likhi jaaegi agle 12 maheene tak hindustan kii tarakkee kii tasviir, jis bajet se tay hogi desh kii arthvyavastha main yogadan dene vaale tamaam udyogon se lekar chote-bade kaarobaariyon kii dashodisha, jo bajet tay karegaa, har maheene aapaki jeb main cat kar aegi kitni tankhwaah?, jo bajet batayega, aapaki kamai se saal main kuch bachat bhi hogi yaa sari kamai dakaar jaaegi mahangaai kii surasa?aakhirkaar us aam bajet kii baari aa gai he, lekin hamaare aapke liye ye jaananaa sabase zyada jaruri he ki vitt mantri pi chidambaram kaa ye 8waan aam bajet deshavaasiyon ke liye raahat kaa pitara kholegaa yaa karegaa afat kii barsaat?kyonki saal 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav he
 This will be the last budget of the UPA-2 government before the 2014 elections, so you can expect a relief and populist budget, but there are some intimidating signs, that is, rubbing butter from above and slowly pocketing
 kehane kaa matlab he ki kahin to aapako raahat kaa sabjbag dikhaaya jayega or kahin aapaki jeb aisi kaati jaaegi ki aap samaj bhi nahin paaenge
 Let's start with relief so that the smile on your face stays on for a while
 -madhyam varg ko khush karne ke liye tex main chhot kii seemaa do lakh se badhaakar do lakh bees hajaar kii ja sakati he
 Also, the slab can also be changed
 iskaa phayda ye hoga ki aapaki jeb main har maheene aane vaali tankhwaah main thodi badhottaree ho jaaegi
 Finance Minister p Chidambaram intends to increase the tax rebate on home loans to boost the housing sector, it may also bring some economic benefit to you
 lekin raahat kii ummid bas yaheen tak
 It is believed that Chidambaram's budget will bring down inflation, more inflation
 -bajet main dijal, alpiji ke daam badhaane kaa rasta saaf ho saktaa he
 - The increase in excise duty is believed to be fixed
 yani fries, tivi se lekar mobile tak sabakuch ho jayega
 - Those earning more can be taxed more
 -sone par aayaat kar badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Disinvestment in government companies can be cleared
 chaar saal baad vitt mantralay laute chidambaram ke saamne chunauti he vittiya ghate ko 4
 To bring up to 8 percent
 or pranab da ke vittamantri rahete munh modane vaale niveshkon main phir bharosa jagaane kii
 The compulsion is that the election is over the head and there is no magic wand in front of Chidambaram
 england kii kamjor team ke khilaaf pehle test match ke drow rahane ke baad ek baar phir team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni kii captaini ke khilaaf aawaaj uthne lagi he
 This time Australia's legendary cricketer Ian Chappell has blown the bugle against Dhoni
 chapel kaa kahana he ki dhoni ko test cricket kii captaini chhod deni chahie kyonki wo test cricket kaa acha captain nahin he
 Earlier this year, after losing the Test series in New Zealand, Ganguly also played a similar tone
 to kya vakt aa gaya he ki dhoni test cricket kii captaini chhod den? chaliye ham aapako samajhaate hai ki kya he puraa maajaraa? bataate hai, kyon abhi bhi dhoni kii test captaini kaa koi vikalp nahin he?phir kyon uth rahi he aawajdhoni kii captaini main team india ko videshi dharti par koi test jite hue teen saal se adhik ho gaye hai or unako hataane kii maang ke peeche yahi sabase bada kaaran he
 Dhoni won a Test for India for the last time on foreign soil in June 2011
 tab westeindies ko team india ne haraaya tha
 Since that victory, Team India has faced only consecutive defeats on foreign soil
 aankadon ke mutabik westeindies main mili us jeet ke baad se team india ne 15 test khele hai or inamen se 10 main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he jabaki paanch test drow rahe hai
 Under Dhoni's captaincy, it is important to know that Team India has won 121 Tests so far and 26 of them have won under Dhoni's captaincy
 ab tak kisi bhi captain se zyada
 Not only this, Team India has so far won only 37 Test matches on foreign soil and 6 of these have been won under Dhoni's leadership
 dhoni test maichon main jeet ke lihaaj se number van bhartiya captain hai
 So far Mahendra Singh Dhoni has captained Team India in 54 Tests and 26 of them (win percentage 48)
 15 fisadi) main jeet mili he
 Dhoni is ahead of any Indian captain in terms of victory in a Test match
 is fehrist main ganguli (21 test jeet), mohammad ajaharuddin (14 test jeet), gavaskar or pataudi (9 test jeet), dravid (8 test jeet), bedi (6 test jeet), kapil dev, sachin tendulkar or ajit wadekar (4 test jeet) dhoni se kahin peeche hai
 Dhoni's performance under his captaincy Mahendra Singh Dhoni has scored 3,130 runs in 84 innings of 54 Tests since 2005
 ek captain ke rup main sarvaadhik ran ke maamle main dhoni 319 ranon ke antar se duusare number par hai
 This record is in the name of Sunil Gavaskar
 gavaskar ne 47 test kii 74 pariyon main 3449 ran banaaye hai
 However, in terms of centuries as captain, Dhoni is at number four with Ganguly and Pataudi
 in teenon ne apni captaini ke dauraan paanch-paanch shatak jade hai
 Gavaskar is ahead of him in this matter with 11 centuries, Azhar 9 centuries, Tendulkar with 7 centuries
 itnaa hi nahin dhoni ke naam captaini pari khelte hue ek test pari main sarvaadhik ran banane kaa ricard bhi he
 Dhoni played this record innings (224 runs) against Australia last year
 yahaan yah gaur karne vaali baat he ki dhoni ke alaava gavaskar or sachin tendulkar hi aise captain hai jinhone apni captaini main doharaa shatak jadaa he
 Now look at these figures too * Dhoni has won more than any captain of Team India on home ground
 * kisi bhi test team ko 4-0 se siries haraane vaale ek maatr captain
 * No team other than Dhoni defeated the legendary team like Australia 4-0
 * newjiland ke khilaaf teen test siries jeetne vaale iklaute captain
 * The only Indian captain to win three series against the West Indies
 * wicket ke peeche 266 kaich va stamping karne vaale dhoni sabase safal bhartiya wicketiper bhi hai
 Figures do not lie and Dhoni is the most successful captain of Team India as a captain
 ian chapel ke aawaaj uthaane ke baavjood dhoni kii captaini par koi khatra nahin dikhataa
 When the figures are so strong, why leave this most successful captain of Team India at the behest of Chapple? Team India is playing a five-test series after 55 years and 4 matches are yet to be played
 ummid he ki team india inamen se kuch test jeet kar siries apane naam karegi or iske baad dhoni kii captaini kii charchaa phir hogi
 Then there will be talk of glorifying them, not removing them

 unhone kaha ki baadh peedit ilaakon main na to prabhavit logon tak pahunchane ke liye naaven uplabdh hai or na hi prabhavit logon tak rashan pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 Paswan alleged that he had gone to visit the flood affected areas but he was sent with such officers, who were not allowing him to reach the flood victims
 unhone kaha ki vah andiaref karmiyon kii madad se kuch ilaakon main baadh peediton se milane ja paae

 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Paswan was asked by RJD chief Lalu Prasad of journalists about allegations of not providing adequate help to Bihar flood victims at the center during a conversation with reporters before attending a meeting of the National Executive of Federation of PTI Employees Unions in Patna

 sibiai ne apane aaropapatr main aarope lagaaya ki agast-sitambar 2010 main 1,676 tatra trakon kii kharid sambandhi file wike singh ke paas lambit thi
 The then army chiefs did not agree with the total requirement requirement of vehicles and felt that this requirement was exaggerated
 isliye unhone vibhinn vibhaagon se iske bare main taaja raay maangi thi
 The CBI charge sheet states that Tejinder Singh met VK Singh at his South Block office on 22 September 2010 and during the meeting, he cleared the file for the purchase of Tatra trucks by the first week of October
 VK Singh was allegedly offered a bribe of Rs 14 crore
 sibiai ke anusaar, is par wike singh bhadak gaye or tejinder singh se tatkaal apane karyaalay se chale jane ko kaha
 He then informed AK Antony about this
 sibiai ke aaropapatr main daawa kiya gaya he ki antni ne is baat kii pushti kii he ki wike singh ne unhen tejinder singh kii ore se hui is peshkash kii jaankaree di thi
 The CBI has recorded the statements of 20 prosecution witnesses including Antony, then Prime Minister's advisors TKA Nair and VK Singh and filed 18 documents with the charge sheet
 jaanch agency ne kaha he ki jaanch ke dauraan purv sena pramukh ne daawa kiya tha ki unhone 22 sitambar 2010 ko apni or tejinder singh ke bich hui baatcheet ko record kiya tha, lekin unhone (wike singh ne) kai prayaason ke baavjood use yah recording uplabdh nahin karai
 He also claims that Tejinder Singh and VK Singh had 'very good working relationship' before the alleged bribe was offered
 usne kaha ki yahaan tak ki wike singh ne tejinder kaa naam neshnal technical research orgenigeshan ke pramukh ke pad ke liye prastaavit karte hue rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar eses menon ko ek patr bhi likhaa tha
 He said, but the two had not been contacted since the incident offering bribes
 raghuvar das sarkaar ke dwaara rajyapal draupadi murmu kii sahmati ke liye bheje gaye vivaadit CNT-SPT sanshodhan act ko lautaa diya he
 In fact, the amendments made in this act were strongly opposed by the opposition parties
 vahiin puure rajya main ise lekar takaraav kii sthiti ban gayi thi or rajya kii adivasee janata iske virodh main sadakon par utar gai thi
 At the same time, the Governor's move has been strongly appreciated by the opposition parties and termed it a victory of democracy
 adivasee hiton kii raksha hui haneta pratipaksh or rajya ke purv mukhyamantri hemanth sorain ne rajyapal ko dhanyavad dete hue kaha kirajyapalke is kadam ne sabit kar diya kii adivaasiyon ke hit main sochnewali adivasee rajyapal rajbhavan main hai
 The move has healed the current explosive atmosphere in the state
 vahin unhone chetavanee dete hue kaha ki sarkaar dobaaraa bill laane kaa dussahas nahin karen , aisa karne par pehle se zyada virodh hoga
 Significantly, in the last winter session, the government passed this amendment bill amidst heavy opposition and uproar by the opposition parties
 lekin iskaa virodh karte hue vipakshi dalon ne rajyapal se lekar raashtrapati tak apni guhaar lagaate hue apni aapattiyaan darj karai thi 
 What is CNT - SPT Act Actually CNT - SPT Act is a law made for the land of tribals
 pehle yah praavdhaan tha ki anusuchit janajati ke bhoomi kaa upyog khan or udyog ke liye kiya jaataa tha or iske liye kamishnar kii manjuuri jaruri thi 
 But after the passage of this bill, now this land can also be used for other schemes like infrastructure, roads, transmission lines for energy, transport, communication
 agar kisi kaam ke liye anusuchit janajati kii jameen lee jaati he to uskaa upyog paanch saal ke andar anivaary rup se karnaa hoga or agar aisa nahin hua to vah jameen jis parivaar se lee gai he, use waapas kar di jaaegi, saath hi jameen ke badale main diya gaya muaavja bhi waapas nahin hoga

 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne england ke khilaaf chauthe ekadivasiy match main team kii paanch wicket kii jeet main rohit sharma ke yogadan kii saraahna kii
 Dhoni described the batsman as the 'most talented batsman'
 dhoni ne match ke baad press conference main kaha, mujhe khushi he ki usne ran banaae, kyonki vah sabase pratibhavan ballebaajon main se ek he
 Of course he needed such an innings
 isse uskaa aatmavishvaas badhegaa or use samay milegaa
 Personally, i am very happy for him
 unhone kaha, ham sabhi ko lagata he ki vah aisa khilaadi he, jo kaaphi acha salaami ballebaaj ban saktaa he, kyonki vah cat or pul kaaphi acha kheltaa he
 Of the two openers, you need to be a bit aggressive and i think he accepted the challenge
 use manoj ke anfit hone ke kaaran team main shaamil kiya gaya tha isliye uske paas mauka tha
 The good thing is that he accepted the challenge
 rohit ne 83 ran banaae, lekin jab dhoni se poocha gaya ki agar yah ballebaaj aaj vifal hota to kya hota to bhartiya captain ne kaha, yah mushkil sawaal he
 i don't know what would have happened if he had not scored or in any other situation
 ham sarvshereshth cheez yah kar sakate hai ki dharmashala main use ek or mauka den or phir dekhen
 We all feel that he is very talented
 use srilanka ke khilaaf pichhali shrunkhlaa main mauka mila jahaan vah kuch acchhee gend par out hua
 Dhoni said that it will be difficult for Rohit to make a place in the middle order, as other players are doing well and due to injury from some players, the opener position is vacant
 tippaniyan The Indian captain suffered a thumb injury during practice before the match and when he was asked about rest in the next match at Dharamshala on 27 January, he kept his options open
 unhone kaha, ham dekhte hai
 The press conference was so quick that i did not get a chance to talk to the selectors
 nischitator par yah mauka he, lekin dekhte hai kya hota he
 i can't confirm anything right now

 The comments logon se jhuthe vaade karke manamaani karne vaale amrapali group ke karnaamon kii pole 'aaj tak' kii khabar main khulne ke baad greater noida athurity ne karrwai kii he
 Authority Chairman Rama Raman has directed ACEO to issue summons to Amrapali Group
 chairman ne kaha ki amrapali group se sabhi samasyaon ko dur karne or maamle ko jald sulajhane kaa bhi pukhta vaada liya jaae
 From 'operation Griha Pravesh' to 'open Polls' today, through 'operation Griha Pravesh', he tried to bring out the pain of those who have fallen victim to the arbitrariness of the builders
 moti rakam chukaane ke baavjood noida or greater noida main amrapali houseing main ghar lene vaale log thaga hua mahasoos kar rahe hai
 If someone is waiting for home entry for 7 years, then for 6 years someone is going around the house in the builder's office
 lekin builder barason se grahako kii ankhon main dhul jhonk rahe hai
 In 2009 and 2010, Amrapali Group had launched a series of projects in Noida and Greater Noida
 isi daur main amrapali ne dhoni ko apana brands ambesder banaaya
 Sold the dream of luxury homes and showed Dhoni's dream of becoming a neighbor
 lekin ye vaade ye daawey sab jhuthe sabit hue
 Those who rely on Amrapali now feel cheated
 kisi ne epady, sona, jamaapunji sab makaan ke naam kar diya or to kisi ne bank se karj lekar develapalar ko sara paisa chukaa diya
 But still this wait of the house is not taking the name of ending
 ghar kaa bajet is karj ke saamne ghutane tech chukaa he
 The world class Aashiyane's dream entry made with animation is one of the few realizations of life
 is pal kii khushi ko shabdon main bayaan karnaa shaayad mumkin he bhi nahin
 To capitalize on this feeling, the builders sell the dream of the house and after playing with the emotions of the people take huge amount out of their pocket
 ghar book karaate vakt anemation dikhaakar ek world class ashiyane kaa sapana dikhaaya jaataa he
 This glass house woven in thoughts starts to break as soon as it is near the date of possession and as soon as the possession is found, the joy of entering the house in that flat is extinguished within a few minutes
 barason tak pojeshan ke liye tarasaane ke baad amrapali ne safaire or platinum main ghar dena shuru to kiya he lekin ye ghar kaaphi khastahal hai
 The registry of the house did not happen, the buyers alleged that the house was given to them in a hurry, but the flaws of the flats are not hidden from the people living here
 fire sefti ke upkaran lage zarur hai lekin wo pani kii pipeline se jude nahin hai or naa hi unke sensors kaam kar rahe he
 Whatever the shortcomings of facilities are as low as mentioned, but the people living in these projects of Amrapali have not yet got the chance to become landlords
 ghar kii registry ke liye builder ko athurity se campilashan certificate yani sisi hasil karnaa hota he or sisi athurity tab detii he jab builder kaam puraa kar detaa he
 It is clear that even in government papers, the work of the builder is incomplete
 jhuthe sabit hue kai vaadekam puraa hone ke baad bhi sisi milanaa kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin hoga kyonki amrapali group ke alag-alag projects par ek artiai ke mutabik, athurity kaa 450 karod rupye bakaayaa he
 That is, till now the developer has not paid the authority for the entire amount of land
 agar develper ne sari aupchaariktaayen puri karke vakt par pajeshan hasil kar liya hota to graahakon ko registry ke liye stamp duty ke taur par badi hui rakam bhi nahin chukaani padati
 After these difficulties, you can understand how people live in Amrapali projects in the environment
 abhi bhi kai towers main kaam chal rahaa he, lift kaa istemaal lebar karti he or saamaan utaarne le jane main tut foot bhi hoti he
 Not only this, the condition of Amrapali Group is worse on security, here the incidents of theft here also bother people
 motaa paisa lene ke baavjood car parking bhi alot nahin kii gai he
 When Dhoni also associated the luxury style of Jhala Palla Amrapali with Dhoni's name, people's trust in Amrapali increased further
 mahendra singh dhoni ke staradam ko is tarah se istemaal kiya gaya ki dhoni kaa padosi banane ke liye logon kii hode lag gai
 Then what was Dhoni became Amrapali's brand ambassador
 amrapali safaire main dhoni kaa bhi ghar hoga, jab is baat kaa prachaar kiya gaya to amrapali safaire main kharidaaron kii line lag gai
 Dhoni's desire to become a neighbor has not only been fulfilled but it has also become difficult to get possession of the house
 amrapali ke graahakon ne dhoni se guhaar lagaai ki wo unhen is sankat se baahar nikaalen
 Dhoni assured the people that he would talk to Amrapali about this
 lekin baat karne se pehle hi unhone amrapali kaa saath chhodkar byrs ko manjhdhaar main chhod diya
 The group is giving false arguments
 On this issue, the chairman of the Amrapali group admitted many shortcomings
 He also argued that the work of these flats was stopped several times
 kabhi kisaanon ke pradarshan kii vajah se to kabhi neshnal green tibunel ke nirdesh kii vajah se
 However, there is also a truth that the National Green Tribunal never directed to stop the work
 kisaanon ke pradarshan kii vajah se bhi noida main kuch maheene or greater noida west main dedh saal hi kaam rukaa rahaa
 But despite this interruption, the three-and-a-half-year promise of possession has expired and poor customers are still forced to bear the double burden of rent and EMI

 shivashankaran ne purv doorsanchaar mantri dayaanidhi maaran kii kya pole khol di? sibiai ke sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki maaran ke khilaaf shikaayat karne waalon main se ek shivashankaran hai
 The multi-purpose Shiva sold its limited service provider Aircel to Malaysian billionaire t Anand Krishnan's Maxis in December 2005, but this may have been done under pressure from the then Telecom Minister
 shiva ne bikri se 80 karod dollar kamaaye, lekin unhen abhi bhi aise jabardastee baahar nikaale jane kaa dard he
 Shiva was benefited in the 2G scam (he was the promoter of the profit making company s Tel)
 ve vartmaan doorsanchaar mantri kapil sibbal kii nyaayadhish shivaraj patil kii ek sadasyeey cameti kii madad se apana cese bana rahe hai
 It is seen from the report that dot delayed the licensing of Aircel Dishnet in 2005
 oemasi kaa kahana he ki maaran ke maatahat dioti ne baar-baar sawaal uthaae jisase deree hui
 Due to this much spectrum wasted
 ho saktaa he shivashankaran ne isi vajah se apana hissaa mexis ko bech diya
 Maran eventually granted the license to Aircel when Maxis bought it the entire way
 licenson ko 2001 ke daam par bechaa gaya jo oemasi kii report ke anusaar 2003 ke cabinet ke faisle kaa ulanghan tha
 Because of this the government treasury suffered a lot

 In his defense, Maran told the press on June 1, "as far as licensing Dishnet wireless is concerned, as far as i remember, even when he took over as telecom minister on May 27, 2004, where is the money in the company? Coming up, questions were being raised on him, how much was his price and what was his debt share ratio
 mere mantri banane se pehle hi aavedan kii jaanch shuru ho chuki thi
 "the truth is that on March 5, 2004, Dishnet Wireless applied for seven licenses and on April 21, 2004 it got these licenses
 ye kaam maaran se pehle aae doorsanchaar mantri kii aguai main hua
 He was issued a license

 use jaldi hi 5 disambar, 2006 ko license mil gaye jabaki vodaphone ko iske liye kareeb do saal intjaar karnaa padaa
 Another allegation is that Aircel broke FDI rules where 74 per cent AFI is allowed in telecom
 malaysian stock exange, barasaa malaysia main mexis ne airsel main 74 pratishat share dikhaa die (jisamen 65 pratishat pratyaksh the or 9 pratishat apratyaksh) or deccan digital main 100 pratishat badhane vaale chhudaa sakane yogya non kanvertible prefrence share the, jis vajah se group ko airsel main nivesh se 99
 The benefit of 3 percent started coming
 mexis ne mana ki uskaa airsel main 99
 3 percent share but the record showed this share to be 74 percent
 airsel main uske 74 pratishat share ke liye mexis ne 7,880 karod ru
 (aircel's equity shares, Deccan Digital's equity shares, Aircel's preference shares, Deccan's preference shares) while Apollo Hospitals' Pratap Reddy family accounted for Rs 26 crore of its 26 per cent stake

 The thing to see here is that CBI is looking for answers to the question whether the current Aircel is just a face and Maxis is just benami ownership
 is samooche prakaran main shivashankaran ke rahasyodghatan sirf shuruyaat hai
 The investigating agencies will be closely investigating the collusion of maran-maxis and Aircel

 'read: Three stories of Aman in Muzaffarnagar, Ram Singh, who lives with his three children in the same area, says,' It is purely politics to bring the two communities together
 hamaare bich koi dushmani nahin he
 There are two temples in the area and after the violence started, the Muslim community took over the responsibility of protecting the temples
 'padhein:benakaab hue mujffarnagar ke mujrimailaake ke nivasee haji imran ansaari kehete hai, 'ham beete kai dashakon se parivaar kii tarah rahete aa rahe hai or kisi bhi surat main ham sampradayik tanaav se is bhaichaare bandhan ko nahin tuutane denge

 But you will probably be surprised to know that one of the Dwadash Jyotirligas is prepared in the 'pushp Nag Mukut' in Jail, adorned in Shringar Puja on the Shivalinga located in Devghar, Baba Baidyanathdham, Jharkhand
 kaamana ling ke naam se vishwa prasiddhbaba baidyanathake sir par shringaar puja ke samay pratidin phulon or belptr se taiyaar kiya hua 'naag mukut' pahanaaya jaataa he
 This snake is prepared by the prisoners in Mukutdevgharki prison
 is puraani parampara kaa nirvahan aaj bhi kaidi bade ullas se karte hai
 This is how the tradition started
 
 
 baba baidyanathdham ke sheersh purohit pandit divakar mishra ne bataaya, 'yah puraani parampara he
 It is said that years ago there was an English jailer
 uske putr kii achaanak tabiyat bahut kharaab ho gai
 Seeing his condition deteriorating, the people advised the jailer to offer 'nag Mukut' in Baba's temple
 jailer ne logon ke kahe anusaar aisa hi kiya or unka putr thik ho gaya
 Since then this tradition has become here
 'unhone kaha ki iske liye jail main bhi puri shuddhta or swatchta se vyavastha kii jaati he
 There is a special room inside the jail to prepare this crown, which people call 'baba Room'
 yahaan par ek shivalay bhi he
 Ashutosh Kumar, the jail superintendent of Deoghar, says that the interest of the inmates to build the crown is seen here
 unhone kaha ki mukut banane ke liye kaidiyon ko samoohon main baant diya jaataa he
 Everyday flowers and bells are made available to the inmates
 kaidi upwas rakhkar baba kaksh main naag mukut kaa nirmaan karte hai or vahaan sthit shivalay main rakh puja-archana karte hai
 In the evening this crown is taken out of the jail and then the crown is worshiped in the pagoda outside the jail
 iske baad koi gelkarmi is naag mukut ko kandhe par uthaakar 'bam bhole, bam bhole', 'bolbam-bolbam' bolta hua ise baba ke mandir tak pahunchaata he
 On the other hand, the prisoners also do Baba's work happily
 kaidiyon kaa kahana he ki baba kii isi bahaane vah seva karte hai, jisase unhen kaaphi sukun miltaa he
 Pandit Diwakar states that on all days of the year except Shivaratri, the snake crown is decorated at the time of Shringar Puja
 shivaratri ke din bhole baba kaa vivaah hota he
 For this reason, this crown is sent to Baba Basukinath Temple

 His statement came after the increase in the prices of petrol and diesel
 petrol companiyon ne kachche tel main badhottaree ke baad shuukravaar ko dijal ke daam main 45 paise or petrol ke daam dedh rupee badha die hai
 Referring to the state budget to be presented on Tuesday, the Chief Minister said that he wants to provide convenience to every section of the society
 bajet main yojanaon ke madhyam se har varg or jati kii madad ke prayaas kiye jaaenge
 He said that along with the facilities in the budget, efforts will be made to implement the schemes of the manifesto with complete honesty
 akhilesh ne purvavarti mayawati sarkaar par apane kaarykaal ke dauraan vikaas kaa koi bhi kaam nahin karne kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki us sarkaar kaa koi bajet aisa nahin tha jisamen pattharon par paisa na kharch kiya gaya ho, koi anupoorak bajet bhi aisa nahin tha
 He completely ruined the state

 Akhilesh said that as per the promise made in his election manifesto, his government has sent a proposal for inclusion of 17 backward castes to the Central Government
 mukhyamantri ne yahaan samaajawaadee party rajya mukhyalay main yojit 17 pichhadi jatiyon ke mahasammelan main kaha ki sarkaar ne nishad, mallaah, bhar, batham, turaha, kahaar, kashyap, kevat, kumhaar, rajbhar, prajapati, dhivar, dhimar, bind, majhi, goud tathaa machuva samet 17 jatiyon ko anusuchit jati main shaamil karne sambandhi prastaav kal kendra ko bhej diya he
 He said that SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav sent a proposal to the Center to include these castes in the Scheduled Castes during his Chief Ministership in the year 2005, which the Mayawati government after him had resentfully withdrew
 gauratlab he ki 10 aktubar 2005 ko rajya ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri mulaayam singh yadav ne ek adhisuchana jari karke nishad, mallaah, bhar, batham, turaha, kahaar, kashyap, kevat, kumhaar, rajbhar, prajapati, dhivar, dhimar, bind, majhi, goud tathaa machuva jatiyon ko anusuchit jatiyon ko milane vaali suvidhaayen di thim lekin unke baad aayi mayawati sarkaar ne us vyavastha ko samaapt kar diya tha
 Akhilesh said that the SP has always fought for the honor of the backward castes and that is why in its election manifesto it promised to include 17 backward castes
 unhone kaha ki yadav kii is muhim main sharad yadav tathaa lalu prasad yadav kii aguwai vaale dalon samet kuch or partiyaan bhi shaamil huin, jiske baad sarkaar jati aadhaarit janaganana karaane ko taiyaar hui
 In this way the first battle was won, now 17 backward castes have to be respected

 i believe in the power of God
 uuparavaala aapako piem bana degaa?bilkul nahin
 i believe in maintaining honesty in behavior and behavior
 har haal main hamen narendrabhai ko pradhanmantri bananaa he
 But the fear is that Narendra Modi will become bigger than the party
 kai baar netaa koi bayaan de dete hai or media use fouran sansanikhej bana detaa he
 Unlike what is being said, i never get angry
 kya maanate hai ki modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad bijepi badal jaaegi?mujhe aisa nahin lagata
 i have known Narendra Bhai since 1986-87 when he was a pracharak and i was the All India General Secretary of bjp's youth wing
 mujhe nahin lagata ki ve bijepi ko badal denge, lekin itnaa jarur he ki desh badal jayega
 i believe that India will become an economic and spiritual superpower
 aap bharat ko aarthik superpavar kaise banaaenge or desh main saanskrithik badlaav kaise laaenge?atal ji ne ek baar kaha tha, ‚Äúchote man se koi bada nahin hota, toote man se koi khadaa nahin hota

 Sushma Swaraj also expressed displeasure over the alliance with the Reddy brothers in Karnataka

 If your party can muster the necessary majority to form the government, will the RSS control the BJP? If the RSS does not control our party, why should it keep the government? He does not do this

 He never forces us to do anything or anything
 aresas kaa netritv badal gaya he
 Nothing has changed in the RSS
 jab ham kuch poochhate hai to uske netaa hamen salaah dete hai apni ichha thopane kii koshish kabhi nahin karte
 You have known Narendra Modi for a long time
 unke kaam karne kaa dhang kya he?narendrabhai swapndrashtaa hai or bade karine tathaa lagan se kaam karte hai
 They do whatever is necessary for good governance
 kya bharat ke bare main aapkaa koi vijan he? aap kaise vikaas karenge?jaisaa hamane 1998 se 2004 (vaajapeyi kii aguai main endie sarkaar ke dauraan) tak kiya, vahi karenge
 But you lost the election, you were a loser, right? The functioning of the government cannot be seen by linking it to winning or losing elections
 logon ko shaayad ham apni uplabdhiyaan bataa nahin paae the
 But today everyone believes that Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government was many times better than him (from UPA)
 salbhar baad adhyaksh pad kaa kaarykaal khatm hone ke baad aap apane liye koun-sa pad chahenge? phir krishi mantri?maine kabhi kisi se kuch nahin maanga
 i will fulfill whatever obligation i am given
 uttar pradesh main kiske jeetne kii ummid he?phir, 1998 kaa nateeja doharaaya ja saktaa he jab hamane 58 siten jiti thim
 i was then the state president of the party
 har kisi ke dimag main ek hi baat he ki agar modi bijepi ke liye 200 siten nahin laa paae to sahyogi dal tay karenge ki koun endie kaa netaa hoga
 We will try our best to win the seats needed for the majority, so that we do not need anyone
 maan lijie ki 200 se kam siten aati hai to kya hoga?aisi kaalpanik baton kii koi jagah nahin he
 Our effort is to make Narendra Bhai the Prime Minister and overcome every obstacle
 sahyogiyon ke bare main kya kahenge?hamaare saath 25 sahyogi hai
 We have good relationships with everyone
 mujhe bharosa he ki narendrabhai rajnatik rup se asprishy nahin hai
 If you see the situation coming out of your hands, pick up the phone and resolve the matter? i only do what i have learned from the party, the Sangh Parivar and my own family
 hamaari khuli baatcheet hoti he or jo bhi faisla hota he, use har koi maanata he

 Accusing the UPA coalition of cracking down on the presidential election, the BJP said on Thursday that allies who had previously mistrusted the leadership of the Manmohan Singh government have now started questioning the leadership of Sonia Gandhi

 unhone kaha, ‚Äòmanmohan ke netritv par pehle hi sawaal uthe hai or ab sonia ke netritv par unke ghar ke saamne hi sawaal uthaaya gaya he
 The BJP spokesperson said that cracks are clearly visible in the UPA government in connection with the presidential election and there is a lack of leadership, cohesion and credibility in the coalition government

 Shahnawaz said that allies no longer want to see Singh as Prime Minister
 mahangaai ko rokane main manmohan or unke kaabil vitt mantri pranav mukherjee vifal rahe hai
 The BJP leader said that when Pranab Mukherjee was speaking on TV, it was expected that he would suggest some concrete steps to reduce inflation, but he reported the rise in inflation in such a way as to count any achievement of the central government
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar apni samasyaon se ghiri he or use desh se koi matlab nahin he
 Crude oil prices have come down but the government has no control over the price of petrol and inflation

 This area falls within the border of Bhutan, but China claims it as Donglong province
 china ne is saal june main jab doklam ke paas sadak banane kii koshishen shuru kin, to bhartiya sainikon ne dakhal dete hue unka kaam rukvaa diya

 While Shiv Sena has been objecting to the felling of trees in Aarey Colony, the metro project is very important for BJP

 He was later made head of the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal, which hears appeals against the decisions of TRAI
 is pad par rahane ke baad unhen tri kaa pramukh banaaya janaa asaamaanya he
 In April, just two weeks before he stepped down, he made some long-term anti-business recommendations
 yahaan tak ki apane kaarykaal ke aakhri din 14 may ko unhone apni mul siforeeshon par doorsanchaar mantralay ke prashnon kaa jawaab diya, jo kaam unhen apane uttaradhikari ke liye chhod janaa chahie tha
 According to the business leaders, Sarma went beyond the recommendations of the Supreme Court
 unki baat main dam he
 The Supreme Court had instructed TRAI that a
 raja ke 2008 main baante gaye 122 licenson kii dobaaraa nilaamee ke liye dishanirdesh jari kare, jinhen court ne farvari main radd kar diya tha
 There are 22 telecom circles in India, so 122 licenses roughly meant six All India licenses
 prayek akhil bhartiya license ko 4
 4 mhz spectrum to be allocated
 iskaa matlab yah he ki supreme court dwaara tay kii gai antim taarikh 31 agast se pehle kul 26
 The 6 mhz spectrum is to be re-auctioned
 sarama kii siforeeshon main kaha gaya he ki nilaamee ke liye sirf 5 megahertz spectrum diya jayega
 This would be enough for an all India license only
 jaahir he spectrum ke aise abhaav main boli bad jaaegi
 To increase this cost problem, Sarma made another recommendation that Raja should be considered as the reserve price of 10 times the amount of licenses he had sold
 sarama ke mutabik aakhri boli kii keemat arakshit mulya se mahaj 20 fisadi upar hogi
 This calculation goes against previous experience as the price was up 80 per cent in 3G auctions
 isse bhi ajeeb baat yah he ki tri kii siforeeshon main darj khud sarama kii sweekaarokti ke mutabik bharat main spectrum kii keemat ucch aay str vaali viksit arthvyavasthaaon main spectrum ke badale lee jane vaali keemat ke mukaable 70-80 fisadi zyada hoti he
 Sarma may have his reasons for stopping the spectrum, but apparently a case of encroachment is made on him when he decides to link the auction of canceled 122 licenses with the future policy of 'reforming' the spectrum allocation
 Got it
 is niti ke tahat tri airtel, vodaphone or duusare operataron se agle saal se 900 megahertz kii bandwidth waapas le legaa jabaki unka 20-20 saal ke license samajhaite khatm hone lagenge or uske badale main kam kshamta vaali 1,800 megahertz ke bandwidth par chale jane ko majaboor karegaa, jo radd kiye gaye 122 licenson ke dharakon ke paas tha
 Any such move would require operators to double their towers

 Overall, such a cost is enough to destroy the telecom companies that are already fighting to make money in this fiercely competitive market

 Obviously, renewing the license after 20 years will incur some costs, but the real issue is that TRAI has not given up an equal opportunity battle for everyone
 ve kehete hai, ''aap is maamle main tata or reliance jaise dohari technology operataron kii sandigdh chuppi ko dekh sakate hai
 "even though some of their spectrum will be reformed, they will have the opportunity to bid on more efficient 900 mhz spectrum and reduce costs
" unhone bataaya, ''jiesem operataron ke mukaable unhen kam nuksaan hoga

 "for Khullar to play his role, it is important that the government rejects Sarma's recommendations or once again sends the TRAI for reconsideration
