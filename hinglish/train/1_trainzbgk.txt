 After all Arvind Kejriwal conquered the fort of Delhi
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii 'baazeegari' or amit shah kii 'chanakya niti' dhari kii dhari rah gayi
 
 
 So what is it to assume that Modi's charisma is fading or that the other player present in the contest is really so powerful and stunted, before which all the bjp's Surma got killed
 nattejey aane se pehle amit shah ne kaha tha ki agar dilli kaa prayog safal ho jaataa he to agle 25 saal tak bijepi ko koi nahin haraa saktaa
 i believe that neither Modi's charisma has faded, nor Amit Shah's 'chanakya policy' has failed, because in fact Modi has no charisma before, nor is it now, and when there was no charisma, then he faded There is no question of falling
 isi tarah ab tak bhaajapa amit shah kii ranneeti se nahin, balki vibhinn pradeshon kii sthiti or vipaksh main foot kaa phayda uthaakar jitati aa rahi he
 This is Modi-devoted media, which gave it the name of charisma and strategy
 pataa nahin log yah kyon bhul jate hai ki bijepi loksabhaa chunaav main bikhare vipaksh ke baad bhi mahaj 31 fisadi vot laakar 282 siten laai thi
 If NDA votes were added to this, then only 38 and a half percent of the votes were received
 isse pehle, shaayad hi aisa hua tha ki itane kam vot laakar koi party centre main is tarah ke bahumat ke saath sarkaar bana le
 After the Lok Sabha elections, the assembly elections in all the states were completely different from Delhi
 masalan, haryana main congress ke khilaaf anti-inkambenci factor jamkar kaam kar rahaa tha or bijepi ke alaava koi vikalp bhi vahaan nahin tha, lihaaja bijepi ko jeet mili
 At the same time, the situation was the same in Jharkhand that the opposition was not united, which benefited BJP
 aisa hi haal maharashtra kaa bhi tha
 People were fed up with the Congress government and there was a split in the opposition
 jaise-taise bijepi or shivasena kii sarkaar phir ban gai
 The same situation also happened in Jammu and Kashmir
 log neshnal conference se tang aa chuke the or vikalp ke taur pidipi or bijepi dikhin to logon ne unhen hi chunaa
 That is to say, wherever there was a solid choice in the fight, people chose it
 dhyaan dene vaali baat yah bhi he ki in rajyon main aisa koi karishmai netaa nahin tha, jis par janata vishwaas kar sake
 Wherever states have rich leaders of charismatic personality, Modi's magic has not gone
 tamilnadu main jayalalita, pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee, odisha main naveen patnayak or telugana main chandrashekhar raav jaise netaaon kii maujuudagi main modi kuch nahin kar paae
 At the same time, even if the BJP has won so many seats in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the big role of state leaders and the thin state of the Congress are big reasons in this
 vahiin dilli main pehali baar narendra modi or amit shah kaa test hua
 Here people had a strong choice as Arvind Kejriwal, so the result is in front of everyone
 agar dilli se sabak lekar vipaksh bihar, bengal or uttar pradesh main lade to muqabla kaaphi dilachasp ho saktaa he
 Although it will take time and hard work for Kejriwal to emerge as an option at the national level even after the victory in Delhi, it will be more effective if he stands against the BJP together with the opposition

 america ne kaha ki vah enesji samooh main bharat ko shaamil karaane ke liye patibaddh he
 Along with this, he said that the international consensus on this cannot be broken because of just one country and insisted that such a member should be made accountable
 america ke raajnneetik maamalon ke upamantri tom shainan ne kaha, 'americaenesji main bharat kaa praveshsunishchit karne ke liye patibaddh he
 The top US diplomat expressed 'sorrow' that his government was not successful in making India a member of the group's annual meeting last week in Seoul

 We will summon the Home Secretary in this matter

 The court reiterated that the deadline of 31 July 2019 will not be extended to complete the NRC process
 court ne nirvachan ayog ko chunaav dauty se rajya ke kuch adhikariyon ko alag rakhane par vichaar karne ke liye kaha he ki taaki yah sunishchit ho ki enarasi kii prakriya jari rahe
 Let me tell you that Assam is the only state which has NRC, it was first formulated in 1951

 6 from 27 lakh families
 5 karod dastavej praapt hue
 But under the second and final draft of Assam's NRC, there was controversy over the list released in July 2018 when 3 applied to join it
 29 karod logon main se 2
 Names of 89 crore people were included
 jabaki 40 lakh logon ke naam shaamil nahin kiye gaye
 After which fears were expressed about the future of those not included in the list
 iske baad enarasi kii masauda suchi main shaamil nahin kiye gaye logon ke paksh main supreme court main guhaar lagaai gai
 On hearing this, the Supreme Court ordered to start the work of accepting the claims and objections of about 40 lakh people left out of the draft NRC
 is prakriya kii shuruuaat 25 sitambar, 2018 ko shuru hui
 The court, in its order, had clarified that there would be no punitive action against those whose names are not included in the draft NRC, as it is just a draft
 haalanki enarasi ke samaksh daawey or aapattiyaan sweekaar karne kii avadhi samaapt ho chuki he
 Hence, the work of reviewing these claims and objections is going on at this time
 adaalat ne pichhali sunwaayee main bhi yah spasht kiya tha ki enarasi kii prakriya puri karne kii samaysima 31july, 2019 se aage nahin badhaai jaaegi

 a petition for personal data and privacy has been filed in the Supreme Court in connection with the whatsapp data to Facebook
 supreme court ne centre, tri, whats ap or fasebuk ko notice jari kar do hafte main dene ko kaha he
 The petition said that every person has a matter of privacy and any rule should be made by the central government
 whats ap ke fasebuk se data share karne kaa maamla sidhe-sidhe privesi ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan he
 Therefore, a rule should be made by TRAI
 ye maamla 155 million logon ke data se judaa he
 The comments yachika main dilli hoicourt ke faisle ko chunauti di gai he
 However, Chief Justice JS Khehar asked the petitioner that it was free service
 agar aapako data share hone kaa dar he to aap ise istemaal kyon karte hai? yaa to aap ise lijie yaa is sarvice ko chod dijie
 On 23 September last year, the Delhi High Court had asked whatsapp to delete the user data till 25 September
 hoicourt kaa kahana tha ki 25 sitambar se pehle agar koi yujar apana acount delit karata he or use fasebuk ke saath saajha nahin karata he to company ko soochna sarwar se delit kerani hogi
 But whatsapp can share the data after September 25 with Facebook
 yah faisla hoicourt ne us janhit yachika ke tahat diya tha, jisamen whatsap kii shering policy par sawaal uthaaya gaya he
 Before that, whatsapp had changed its policy to share its users' data with Facebook
 iskaa makasad yuzars tak sateek vigyaapan pahunchaana tha
 The petition has challenged the decision of the Delhi High Court
 haalanki chif justise jees khehar ne yachikakarta se poocha ki ye free sarvice he
 If you fear data sharing, why do you use it? Either you take it or leave this service
 dilli hai court ne pichley saal 23 sitambar ko whatsap ko 25 sitambar tak kaa yujar data bhi delit karne ko kaha tha
 The High Court said that before September 25, if a user deletes his account and does not share it with Facebook, then the company will have to delete it from the information server
 lekin 25 sitambar ke baad ke data ko whatsap, fasebuk ke saath saajha kar saktaa he
 This decision was given by the High Court under a PIL in which the sharing policy of whatsapp has been questioned
 bataa den isse pehle whatsap ne apni niti main badlaav kar apane yuzars kaa data fasebuk ke saath share karne kii baat kahi thi
 Its purpose was to deliver accurate advertising to the users
 yah faisla hoicourt ne us janhit yachika ke tahat diya tha, jisamen whatsap kii shering policy par sawaal uthaaya gaya he

 Like the monsoon, Bhadon month also has special significance in Hinduism
 jaise sawan main somvaar kii mahatta he vaise hi bhadon ke ravivaar kaa bhi bada mahatv hota he
 It is believed that this month Lord Vishnu wakes up after completing his sleep
 yahi vajah he ki is puure maheene ravivaar ko surya or bhagwaan vishnu kii puja karne se sadhak ko vishesh fal kii prapti hoti he
 On Sunday, the sun has its highest energy
 jyotish ke anusaar jataka kii kundali main surya kii sthiti thik na ho to use samaaj main maan-sammaan nahin miltaa he
 He suffers all his life
 uske jivan main khushhaali nahin aa paati
 This is the reason why it is advisable not to do anything special on Sunday
 khaastaur se bhado ke ravivaar ko ye kaam bilkul nahin karne chahie
 By performing these tasks, the Sun planet has to face the ill effects
 isliye ravivaar ke din kuch baton kaa dhyaan rakhane se suryadev kii sadaiv krupa bani rah sakati he
 
 
 Avoid doing this work on the Sunday of Bhado - Do not use salt before sunset on Sunday
 aisa karnaa ashubh mana jaataa he
 It is also said that one should not have sex before Sunday night
 kisi bhi vyakti ko is din maance or madiraa kaa seven nahin karnaa chahie
 People usually cut their hair on Sundays
 lekin aisi manyata he ki ravivaar ko bal kataane se surya kamjor hota he
 Therefore, doing haircut and massage oil in the head and burning of milk should not be done on this day
 -ravivaar ko ho sake to tambe se nirmit chizon ko kharidne or bechney se bachein
 Do not wear blue, black and gray clothes on this day
 sambhav ho to is din juute na pahanen
 If you take care of all these things on every Sunday falling in the evening, then you will never have to face the evil sight of the Sun planet
 surya bhagwaan hameshaa aapke upar apni krupa banaae rakhenge

 a few weeks of intense thinking ensued, in which it was decided to make the film in two parts and after that Rajamouli started making India's most expensive film with thousands of artists, technicians and craftsmen

 Would have spent - 300 crore from the earlier estimated budget for the two films

 It is primarily a project of Made in India, whose story is tied to Indian myths, but the film's look and appeal is global
 28 april ko yarlgadda, devineni prasad (jinhone prashasnic kaam sambhala tha), rajmouli or unke saath kaam karne vaale log us aitihaasik adhyay ko puraa kar chuke honge, jo unhone shuru kiya tha
 Then two questions arise — Is Bahubali: The Concluion National Award winning Part-1 Rs 600 crores
 kii kamai ko peeche chhod paaegi
 Second question, "why did Katappa kill Bahubali?" "pichley do varshon se rajmouli kii puri koshish rahi thi ki hyderabad se bahubali kaa koi seen li na hone paae or ve isamen safal bhi rahe
 Says Rajamouli, "if a line had found its answer, people would have discovered this secret

 Vijayendra Prasad wrote the story of this film, he created a great ending episode to entice the audience

 "sweated by the rising costs," says Paysierlagadda, "people thought we were fools
" ve film ke pehle bhaag ke relies hone se pehle hi hamen khaarij kar chuke the
 Before Bahubali, Arca mediaworks was able to make only three films, including Rajamouli's Maryada Ramanna (2010), which was produced in Hindi as Son of Sardar
 bahut se logon ko film ke aasmaan choote bajet kii vajah se is project ke doobane kaa dar sataane laga tha
 But there was no option for Arca mediaworks to be wary of it
 yarlgadda kehete hai, ''main jaanata tha ki isaki (badhata bajet) vajah kisi kii sanak nahin he, balki kisi kaa mehtaanaa he
 "the trust built between Rajamouli and the company in a decade has only resulted in the creation of Bahubali
 is bharose ke kaaran hi rajmouli magadhira (2009) or iga (2012) jaisi telegu kii superhit filmein de sake
 Says Yerlagadda, "I don't think i could have trusted so much any other filmmaker
" " rajmouli kaa kahana he, ''produsar or diarector ke bich aapasi samaj jaruri he
 If it does not happen at the beginning of the film, then it appears even when the film is made
 "akhil bhartiya film kaa janm2013 ke shuru main mumbai main spice piaar ke publicist prabhaat choudhary ko hyderabad bulaakar rajmouli se milwaaya gaya
 The aim was: to take Bahubali ahead of South India with the help of an agency with its influence in North and West India
 choudhary bataate hai ki rajmouli apni pregentation main film ke pehle bhaag main ek jharne ke drishy ke bare main baariki se bataa rahe the

 After the promotion in Chandigarh, the film's main cast is going to Ahmedabad, where they will have dinner with a plate called Bahubali at the Raivadu Hotel, followed by a program in Varanasi, where people have a special affection for Shiva, and then finally Delhi
 Is the number
 choudhary kehete hai, ''bahubali se pehle akhil bhartiya film kii baat ek kalpana hi thi
 Now the way is ready
 "bollywood ke liye misaalafilm nirmaan main itane vistaar se kaam karnaa or paanch saal tak uskaa prachaar-prasar karnaa bollywood ke liye model ho saktaa he, jabaki bollywood main superstaron ko hi ahmiyat di jaati he
 Siddharth Roy Kapur, former head of Disney India, who made films like Dangal, says Bahubali is an eye-opening film for the Hindi film fraternity
 hindi film birdari badi filmon ke liye superstaron par nirbhar rahati he
 "what makes Bahubali even more impressive is that it has achieved such great success with actors like Prabhas and Rana Daggubatti, while the Hindi film audience does not know much about these artists
 ve sirf rajnikant or camel hasan se hi mukhya rup se parichit hai

 Going into the past and creating a new world is not only expensive work, but also very hard work
 haalanki pehle phantsi par aadhaarit filmein banati rahi hai jaise aan (1952), dharam vir (1977) or ajooba (1991) lekin dron (2008) or vir (2010) or haal hi main moenjodaaro (2016) kii baari asafalataa ke baad nirmaataaon kaa bharosa lagata he, usase uth gaya he
 "it's not that our fantasy is limited," says Kapoor
 " ve kehete hai ki hamaare liye chintaa is baat ko lekar rahati he ki kya technology or bajet kaa pratifal milegaa
 "it is not right to blame studios alone," he says
 kisi bade star ke bina film banane ke liye himmat or kaabiliyat honi chahie
 "though Rajamouli, Yerlagadda is not confident that the studio model allows films like Baahubali to be made
 hollywood jahaan acshan filmein banaata he, jo jaruri nahin he ki superstaron par nirbhar hon, vahiin bollywood ab bhi is tarah kaa model apnaane ke maamle main bahut dur he
 "the studio system has a framework," says Yerlagadda
 iske adigalapan ke kaaran maanviya nirnay ke liye bahut kam jagah bachati he
 You have to work within certain limits and rules
 "desi fantasy vaali kahanebahubali ko kai vajahon se bhartiya cinema main ek maandand ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 It is a film in which the filmmaker is more important than its actors
 rajmouli sirf ek filmkaar bhar nahin hai, ve ek drashtaa bhi hai, jo darshakon ko kaalpanik duniya main le jate hai, jis tarah hollywood ke steven spilberg or christopher nolan jaise film nirmaataa ek anokhi duniya kii rachana karte hai
 It is Rajamouli's unique imagination in which the action and visuals keep the audience hooked till the end
 rajmouli kii drushti bhale hi pashchim kii ho lekin ve amar chitra katha comics ke jabardast prashansak rahe hai, jis vajah se pracheen kaal kii kahaniyaan unhen film banane ke liye aakarshith karti rahi hai, jo agar ankhon ko bhaati hai to dilon ko bhi chooti hai
 He says, "I know that if you have an original story and the story is presented well, it will show its effect anywhere
" meraa maananaa he ki hamaare paas mahabharat or ramayana jaise mahakavy hai, hamaare paas mahaan itihaas or samrudh samskruti he, par ham lambey samay se uski upeksha karte rahe hai
 We try to imitate the films of the West
 main iske khilaaf nahin hum, par jab hamaare paas khud ek bada khajaana he to samajhadaari yahi he ki hamen iskaa upyog karnaa chahie
 "rajamouli and his father as two musclemen Amarendra and Mahendra have created a desi superhero whose physical powers remind you of Hollywood superheroes, but their personalities resemble the heroes of Indian mythology
 bijjaldev apni tikadmi chaalon se mahabharat ke shakuni mamaa se miltaa-julata charitra he, bhallaldev kuch-kuch duryodhana jaisaa he, jo maanata he ki uske saath galat hua he or vah kisi bhi keemat par samrajya ko hasil karnaa chahta he, mahendra ek kartavyaparayan putr he, jo bhagwaan ram jaisaa he, or amrendra mahabharat ke bhim jaisaa mahaan yoddha he, katappa ramayana ke hanuman kii tarah rajya kaa sachcha sevak he
 Amish Tripathi, a fan writer of Bahubali Part-1, says that Rajamouli, like most storytellers of ancient tales, seems to be influenced by India's mythological stories such as the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Puranas
 ve kehete hai, ''is film ne darshakon ko apni bhavyata ke kaaran to aakarshith kiya hi, saath hi is baat ne bhi aakarshith kiya ki isamen hamaari kahaniyaan hai, hamaare mahal or hamaare mandir hai
 It has a bizarre mixture of awe and our consciousness, whereas we do not feel this kind of connection while watching Hollywood movies
 usamen hamaare liye sirf vismay kaa tatv hi hota he
 Look at Bahubali, who seems to be his hero
 "sirf charitra hi nahin, balki film kaa darshan bhi hamen aakarshith karata he
 Tripathi says, "it" speaks of "religion", and by that i do not mean a religion, but the right way to live
 or isamen ''karm" dikhaata he ki hamen kis tarah uskaa nirvaah karnaa chahie
 This sense of karma is clearly visible in the character of Katappa, a highly respected character of Bahubali and whose single act causes heavy damage to Mahishmati
 treepathi kehete hai, ''hamaari parampara main puri tarah se achche or puri tarah se dusht charitra nahin hote hai
 We also have our own story of the enemy and you can learn something from him as well
 "yah baat bahubalih da canaklujan kii tag line se bhi pataa chalati he, jo is prakaar he—''do sahi or koi bhi galat nahin, ke bich kii jang" ab aapse kaha jaataa he ki aap tay karen ki aap kiskaa paksh lete haih team bahubali kaa yaa team bhallaldev kaa
 History created by myths does not mean what kind of story you like, but it is certain that you will get a lot of entertainment in this film
 yahi vajah he ki karan johar or anil thadani ne is film ke hindi sanskaran ke vitaran adhikaar le liye
 Johar, in his memoir Unsuitable Boy, explains how he was associated with the film, writing, "I knew he was making a big film
" 
 
 jo bajet, bhavyata or kahani ke str par bahut bahut badi he
 
 
 And i firmly believe that it is not an ordinary film of the South in terms of presenting quality, technique and story, but it is a film to honor the South
 rajmouli ko kahani ke prastutikaran main maharath hasil he
 "with the new incarnation of the action film (magadheera) and the revenge story Eega, Rajamouli had already realized his worth from the south
 lekin unhen ab bhi maniratnam, shankar, ram gopal verma or priyadarshan jaise filmkaaron kii paant main jagah hasil nahin hui thi
 But of the Telugu filmmaker
 raghavendra raav ke shishy rahe rajmouli bahubali ke baad filmkaaron ke is club main na sirf shaamil ho gaye hai, balki unhen bharat ke nae shoman kaa darja mil gaya he
 He has brought Telugu cinema aka Tollywood, which Kollywood often suppressed due to his technical strength
 raav kehete hai, ''bahubali 75 varshon ke bhartiya cinema ke baad asaadhaaran punarnirmaan kaa pratik he
 "rao has so far directed 108 films and has been named as a presenter in the Bahubali film
 ve kehete hai, ''is film ne pracheen kahaniyon par sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon main film banane kii raah khol di he
 "actor Rana Daggubatti Venkatesh says," Rajamouli should be credited and praised for his great vision and taking Indian cinema internationally
 mayabazar (1957) ke baad bahubali ne nishchit rup se telegu cinema ko nai oonchaaiyon par pahunchaaya he
 "these films have broken the boundaries of regional cinema and the culture of Bollywood superstars
 bhavyata, bharpoor naatakeeyata or laajawab acshan ne darshakon ko ek baar phir cinema haal kii taraf darshakon ko khinchaa he
 Wazir Singh, editor of Box Office India, says, "every scene of the film creates a desire in you to see it on the big screen
 " kareeb do saal ke antaraal ke baad duusari film aane ke baavjood film nirmaataaon ne bahubali ke prati rochakata or jigyaasa ko banaae rakhaa he or iske liye kahani ko anek roopon main pesh kiya jaataa rahaa he, jaise anand nilkanthan kii kitaab, graphic india kii ore se comics, amejan prime video par anemated siries, tivi siries, mobile game or bahubali ke chitron vaale kapade aadi
 High expectations are being raised about Bahubali: The Conclusion, which is going to be released simultaneously on 6,500 screens in the country
 kapur kehete hai, ''mujhe bahut khushi hogi, agar yah film pehle ke recordon ko todatii he, kyonki yah dikhaati he ki film udyog tarakkee kar rahaa he

 The country is eagerly awaiting the introduction of the Lokpal Bill in the Winter Session of Parliament
 team anna ko bhi sarkaar ne baar baar bharosa dilaayaa ki 22 disambar tak lokapal bill aakar rahegaa lekin sansad main lokapal bill ke pesh hone par ek baar phir ashanka ke badal lagate dikh rahe hai
 The news that Lokpal Bill is happening again seems to be a victim of conspiracy
 ashankaayen paidaa ho rahi hai ki kahin atak to nahin jayega lokapal kyonki lokapal bill draft saunpane ke liye standing kamity ne ek hafte kaa or vakt maanga he
 It is worth mentioning that the standing committee of Parliament on the Lokpal Bill was to be drafted and submitted to the government by 7 December so that the draft would be put forward in the cabinet and then the process of making Lokpal law would be completed by placing it in both the houses for approval of the Parliament but For the time being, the standing committee needs more time
 standing kamity ne lokapal kaa draft saunpane ke liye 1 hafte kaa or vakt maanga he yani ab lokapal bill kaa draft 14 disambar tak taiyaar ho paaegaa
 Now the question arises that when the Standing Committee will submit the draft Lokpal Bill by December 14, when will the draft be approved by the Cabinet and then how will the Lokpal Bill be approved by the Houses of Parliament by December 22? Is there a conspiracy to trap Lokpal once again? gujarat ke naalia main sena, vayusena or thalsena ne kiya abhyasamejar general ashok dhingra ke netritv main kiya gaya sainya abhyasabhartiya suraksha balon ne desh ke dushman or aatankwaad ke khilaaf bhavishya main sargical strike jaise badi sainya karrwai ko anjaam dene ke liye bada sainya abhyaas kiya he

 nursery admician ko lekar dilli sarkaar ko bada jhatka laga he
 The High Court has dismissed the appeal of the Delhi government in this case
 dilli hoicourt kii dabl bench ne is maamle main single bench ke aadesh ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 The Delhi government has decided to challenge the High Court order in the Supreme Court
 dilli sarkaar ke nursery admician se jude 7 janvari ke notification par ste bhi barqaraar rahegaa
 This means that this year there will be no admission to nursery on the basis of Neverhood Criteria
 hycourt kaa yah aadesh didie land par bane privet skulon ke liye badi raahat he
 Earlier, on 16 February, the Delhi High Court's single bench gave a stay on the January 7 notification of the Delhi government, giving a big verdict on the nursery
 iske alaava court ne sarkaar ke nevarhood criteria ko bhi radd kar diya tha
 The High Court had said that the notification of the government was taking away from parents the right to enroll in the school of their choice, hence it is canceled
 hoicourt ne kaha tha ki qualityagukeshnake naam par sarkaar privet skulon ke saath manamaani nahin kar sakati he
 This decision of the High Court has cleared the way for nursery admission this year
 sarkaar ke notification ke baad paidaa hua sanshay khatm ho gaya he
 Private schools had challenged the LG Cannotification in the High Court for admission in Delhi government nurseries
 notification main sarkaar ne privet skulon ko kaha tha ki didie kii jameen par bane skool nursery main daakhila lene ke liye nebarhud cretariyaa ko lagu karenge
 298 private schools in Delhi were affected by this notification
 skulon kii ection cameti kaa kahana tha ki unke hiton ko nuksaan nahin hona chahie or sarkaar ko chaatro ke bich koi bhedbhaav nahin karnaa chahie

 chhattisgarh main ski yojana sawaalon ke ghere main he
 To please voters, Chhattisgarh government was going to install mobile towers at a cost of about one thousand crores
 yahi nahin 55 lakh se zyada logon ko rajya kii bijepi sarkaar muft smart phone bhi baanteti
 But after the opposition's uproar on this issue, the government has to take a U-turn now
 haalanki mobile network kaa sanchaalan nijee company karegi
 The private company will directly benefit from this scheme
 graminon ko sirf muft kol karne kii suvidha hogi
 Many opposing parties, including the Congress, are accusing the BJP of wastage regarding this strange-poor scheme
 unke mutabik yah sarkari dhan kaa beja istemaal he
 Due to the opposition of the people, making a general change in their intention, the Chhattisgarh government has taken a U-turn in the plan to install mobile towers under the Sky scheme with the amount of panchayats
 rajya kibijepisarkaar ne gaanv-gaanv main free main smart phone dene kaa vaayada kiya he
 The villagers will have a smart phone before the assembly elections
 wo vyavdhaan rahit baatcheet kar saken iske liye mobile tower lagaae ja rahe hai
 But it was decided to spend the cost of setting up the mobile tower from the development fund of the panchayats
 is yojana ke tahat sabhi panchayaton main mobile tower lagane ke liye raashi nijee companiyon ko dena tha
 Protests started across the state
 congress ne sarkaar par bhrashtrachaar kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The Congress said that the mobile towers would be levied at the expense of the panchayats, but the companies providing mobile networks would benefit
 kyonki sarkaar ne mobile tower ke kiraye kaa koi bandosbast nahin kiya he
 While the construction of the tower will be borne by the panchayats
 iske baad kai panchayaton ne is maamle main sarkaar ko gherna shuru kar diya he
 Finally, after meeting the panchayat workers, Chief Minister Raman Singh has announced to withdraw his decision
 unhone kaha ki ab mobile tower nirmaan kaa kharch khud rajya sarkaar vahan karegi
 He said that the state government would withdraw its previous order in this regard in a day or two
 chhattisgarhmen rajya kii bijepi sarkaar pehali khep main 55 lakh smart mobile phone muft main degi
 The government believes that this will bring about a communication revolution in the state
 sarkaar is yojana main lagbhag ek hajaar karod vyay karne vaali he
 This plan of BJP is being tightened on political considerations
 mana ja rahaa he ki muft mobile phone baantkar rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ek bada vot bank hasil karne vaali he
 Assembly elections are due in the state this year
 iske maddenjar hi sarkaar ne ek badi aabaadi ko mobile dekar khush karne kii koshish kii
 But the Congress did the work on the intention of the government
 congress ne panchayaton kii rakam ko lekar rajya bhar main bijepi ke khilaaf acha khaasaa bakheda khadaa kar diya
 The Congress argued that the money from the panchayats is for the overall development of the village
 isse sadak, bijli, pani, swasthya jaisi mulbhoot suvidhaon ko jutanaa chahie, na ki ise mobile tower banane main
 This issue fell heavily on the BJP
 is faisle ko lekar bijepi samarthak panchayatein bhi sarkaar ke khilaaf khadi ho gai
 Ultimately, Chief Minister Raman Singh's government had to take a U-turn due to opposition from panchayats
 vidhansabha satr ke shruwati daur main hi bijepi sarkaar ne apane virodhiyon ke aage ghutane tech die
 The government's sudden U-turn has raised the voices of opponents

The Congress leader tweeted, "all NDA / BJP talk loudly to take back occupied Kashmir and gilgit-baltistan from Pak but none of them It is not dare to say that we will withdraw Aksai China from the Chinese, which was given to it illegally by Pakistan in 1963

 Just as Kejriwal took the mike on stage during the afternoon in Korali, a farmer from Dausa in Rajasthan tried to climb a nearby tree and try suicide
 manch se kejarivalakisaanon ke hitonper bolte rahe or wo kisaan jindagi or maut ke bich aspataal main jujhataa rahaa or ant main vah jindagi kii jang haar gaya
 There were thousands of people in the rally but no one bothered to save the farmer who committed suicide
 najar ke saamne ye tamaasha chalata rahaa or log raily main mashgool rahe
 According to the suicide note from the farmer, the farmer was a resident of Dausa, Rajasthan
 raily ke dauraan vah ped se latakta mila tha, jiske baad logon ne use neeche utaara
 In the slip received by him, 'jai Jawan Jai Kisan, Jai Rajasthan' was written with the mobile number
 gajendra naam ke is kisaan ne yah bhi likhaa ki uske teen bachche hai or vah pareshaan he
 In this case, Rajasthan Congress President Sachin Pilot said that he will provide all possible help to the farmer's family
 unhone kaha ki is ghatana se jaahir hota he ki kisaan kis haalat main ji rahe hai
 Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal, who rushed to RML Hospital to see the farmer, said that during the rally he and the workers asked the farmer to come down from the tree but he did not listen to anyone and committed suicide
 modi sarkaar par barase kejarivaljantar mantar par raily ko sambodhit karte hue kejariwal ne kaha ki adhyadesh tab laayaa jaataa he jab koi majaburi ho
 What was the compulsion in front of the Narendra Modi government? Kejriwal alleged that perhaps the Modi government was trying to implement this law by bringing an ordinance when it wanted to benefit an industrialist
 unhone kaha ki dilli main jameen hamaare adhikaar main nahin he lekin ham puri koshish karenge ki kisaanon ke saath anyaay na ho

 It would be better to use it without cover
 back panel kii texture kii vajah se phone haath se giregaa nahin
 The phone is compact, you will be able to use it easily with one hand

 This is probably the first smartphone at this price in the Indian market which has a USB Type c port

 An 8-megapixel front camera is provided at the top of the screen

 iske saath Adreno 505 bhi he
 There are two variants of this smartphone - 32GB memory with 2GB RAM and 32GB internal storage with 3GB RAM

 This smartphone is for average use, because its processor and its price does not allow you to use heavy
 internet browjing, soshal media, video, gane se lekar duusari jarur kaam is par aasaani se kiye ja sakate hai
 But this phone is not for gaming
 kuch games tri kiye maine, phone garm hota he
 Multiple apps can be used simultaneously in this smartphone and there is no problem in learning from one app to another
 lekin agar aap ek saath darjanon ap open karke yuj karne vaale hai to ye phone aapke liye nahin he
 Because in this phone you will feel lag

 The camera of Redmi 8A is impressive, especially in this segment, we have not seen any smartphone with such camera for some time
 do camere bhale hi dekhne ke mili hai, lekin iskaa single camera bhi kamaal kaa he
 Basic photography is very good
 liting acchhee to or bhi behatar he
 However, you will see a lot of grains in photos clicked in low light
 keemat ko dekhte hue, baat karen to iskaa portret mod bhi acha he
 The camera is the same, but the portrait mode is software based and this mode is averaged
 outdoor main kuch achche shots is smartphone se liye ja sakate hai

 Today, 45 years later, the world knows him as Arvind Kejriwal - the Chief Minister of Delhi and the father of a hitherto unimaginable political revolution whose strength is not linked to any religion, caste, class or cadre
 kejariwal parivaar hisar ke bahari ilaake main jindal strips ke karmchaariyon kii ek basti main rahata tha
 Arvind's father was an electrical engineer in the same factory
 unka bahut saadhaaran-sa ghar saamaan se bharaa rahata tha
 The family had only one scooter named after the vehicle
 kejariwal kehete hai ki bachapan kii yaaden bahut dhundhlee hai
 But my cousins, who spent a lazy summer vacation, and their friends at the campus school in Hisar after studying in English-medium missionary schools in Sonipat and Ghaziabad, remember the qualities of Arvind and his devils
 kejariwal akasar classroom main chupchaap baithe rahete the
 The hair of a boy with a flat smooth face was always neatly trimmed
 arvind bahut zyada baahar ghoomane-phirane vaala ladkaa nahin tha
 He was fond of chess and books rather than cricket and football
 uske haath main ek pencil or sketch book hameshaa rahati thi
 By the age of 11, he used to draw whatever he saw
 phir chaahe vah ped ho, imaaraten ho, koi jaanavar yaa kamare main rakhi hui koi cheez
 (kejriwal, most rightly, along with his parents and siblings) Every summer vacation at Nana's house in Bara Mohalla, nine or ten of my siblings used to run around
 lekin kejariwal aaj kii tarah unke samooh ke netaa nahin the
 Instead of becoming a leader, he used to join their flock
 us samooh kii gyaan baghaarne vaali rishte kii bahan kusum goyal thim, jo ab dilli ke pashchim vihaar main chartered acanutent hai
 His childhood games included games like unch-neech and poison-amrit
 san 2000 main jab tak desh main technology kii dhooma nahin much gai, tab tak hindustan ke madhyavargeey bacchon ke bich aise hi khel lokapriy the
 Kusum Goyal told India Today, "arvind was neither very quiet nor hyper active like some of today's children
 ham sab shararti the, par itane chatur bhi the ki aisa kuch na karen ki bado se daant khaane kii naubat aa jaae
 Kejriwal was raised as a religious child since childhood
 sonipat or gajiabad main skool main niyamit carch jane kaa un par gaharaa asar padaa
 Hindu moral sermons were heard in the house
 ve subah or raat main sone se pehle prarthana karte the or agar kabhi din main samay mil jaae to tab bhi prarthana kar liya karte the
 Sometimes even in adolescence, he showed such a sense of responsibility and a sense of truth that people around him were surprised
 doston ko ek ghatana yaad he, jab ve vaad-vivaad pratiyogita main apni skool kii team main chune gaye the par pratiyogita se pehle kii raat unhen tej bukhaar ho gaya
 Nobody expected that he would come the next day, but Arvind reached there, sitting on his father's scooter, wearing a blanket
 arvind kaa drudhnishchay tha ki kuch bhi ho, skool kii haar nahin honi chahie
 The night before the eighth grade examination, his younger sister Ranjana fell ill
 vah padhgaye kii haalat main nahin thi
 In such a situation, Arvind sat all night and read the book of his course, so that he could remember the lesson without much emphasis
 41 saal kii ranjana aaj doctor hai or haridwar main rahati hai
 She works at BHEL
 unke 38 varshiya bhai manoj pune main ibm main ejeeniyar hai
 (income tax officer Kejriwal worked for NGO tax reform and Right to Information
 )apane guruon main kejariwal ko sabase acchhee tarah misses chopra yaad hai, jo campus skool main biology padhaati thim or kabhi-kabhi class ke baad unke saath baithkar bhavishya kii yojana par baat karti thim
 It was he who encouraged Arvind to learn the art of making speeches
 arvind jab dasvin class main the to unhen ek naatak main bhoomika nibhaane ke liye bhi kaha
 Moving on this path, Kejriwal became the Governor of the Hindi Drama Society in the final year of iit-kharagpur
 shaayad isse bhi badi baat yah he ki ab ve achaanak apane joshilay or ojasvi bhaashanon se kisi bhi bheed main josh or ummid jagaa sakate hai
 It was only after he left home to study mechanical engineering for the first time that Kejriwal's political thinking began to take shape and at the same time he had a passion to work for people who were less fortunate than him in life
 (janalokapal campan ke ufaan ke dinon main anna hajaare ke saath kejariwal)iity ke dinon main kejariwal ke saathi or nehru haul hostel main chaar saal tak unke saath rahe namith aroda ke shabdon main, arvind ‘‘apni baat kehane main mukhar, aatmavishvaas se bhare hone ke saath-saath bahut joshilay’’ bhi hai
 George Lobo, another partner of Kejriwal, lives in America nowadays
 jorge kehete hai ki jab baaki sab log videsh main naukariyaan khojane or apana kariyar banane main vyast the, tab bhi kejariwal hameshaa kuch aisa karne kii baat karte the, jisase bharat main badlaav aa sake
 Friends claim that Vishwanath Pratap Singh had a profound influence on Kejriwal initially
 raksha mantri ke rup main boforce ghotaale main unki eemaandaaree or pradhanmantri ke rup main mandal ayog ke report ke aadhaar par aarakshan lagu karne ke saamaajik nyaay ke unke prayaason ne yuva kejariwal ko prerit kiya
 George Lobo said that Kejriwal had strongly opposed the BJP for the Ram temple movement
 isi andolan kii parinti 1992 main ayodhya main babari masjid giraae jane main hui thi
 Lobo questions, "he was a brilliant student
 uske saamne avasaron kaa bada sansar khulaa hua tha
 When we have a lucrative and lucrative career in front of us, how many of us would like to leave it and spend our lives in the service of the country? "he says," i am earning a lot of money here in America and Arvind would Was ten times more capable
 ’’kejariwal ke parivaar ko aaj bhi yaad he ki iity ke aakhri saal ke baad jab ve hisar laute to sirf badan ke kapade the or waapas lautne ke liye rakhe gaye paison main se bachi hui rakam thi
 Apart from this, whatever else he had, he donated everything
 lekin jindagi kaa asli nirnaayak mode vah tha, jab jamshedpur main tata steel kii naukari chhodie ke baad kolkata main mishanrij of churity main ve madar terresa se mili
 Tata Steel people had given him an engineer job, so they were not sending him to social service department
 kejariwal ne india today ko bataaya, ‘‘kolkata, jamshedpur se bahut paas he
 i had heard a lot about Mother Teresa and thought i would go and meet
 mishanrij of churity main lambii qatari lagi hui thi
 When my turn came, he kissed my hand and i expressed my desire to work with him
 vah mere liye divine pal tha
 He told me to go and work in Kalighat Ashram
 main vahaan do maheene rahaa
 Kejriwal appeared in the Civil Services Examination and was elected to the Revenue Service for the first time

 1993 main musuri main laal bahadur shastri prashasnic academy main prashikshan ke dauraan unki mulaakaat apni saathi iares adhikari sunita se hui
 He had come to know Sunita well during the 62-week recruitment program for Revenue Service Officers at the National Directorate Academy in Nagpur
 kejariwal ne reman magasoysoy foundation dwaara taiyaar kii gai apni jeevani main bataaya he ki, ‘‘ham ek-duusare ko bahut pasand karte the
 She is very shy and good woman
 ek din maine unka darwaja khatkhataya or puch liya, shkya tum mujhase shaadi karogi?’’ or baat ban gai
 In 2005, this foundation gave him the award of Earning Leadership

 He targeted his income tax department, which was not even aware that he was the only one to pressurize him for honest taxation and early payment
 (dilli chunaav ke baad kejariwal kii jeet kaa lahar)lekin kejariwal ko laga ki unke enjio kaa asar bahut simit he
 To solve the urgent problems of a large number of people, they will not have to know how long, how many days and how many doors have to be knocked
 kejariwal kehete hai, ‘‘hamaari ummiden tab badhin, jab soochna kaa adhikaar (artiai) kanoon aayaa
 But later i realized that RTI is an incomplete tool
 agar koi jail nahin bheja jaataa to soochna hasil karke bhi ham kya kar lenge? hamen laga ki hamaare desh main jis tareeke se raajnneeti kii ja rahi he, use hi badalane kii jarurat he
 We started the Jan Lokpal movement and later formed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)

 Kusum said that she is worried about the future of her son and daughter, who are slightly older than Pulkit and Harshita

 com / bwabvlijac Recently the country's famous wrestler, The Great Khali, has added a cement company
 unki yah aid soshal media par khub viral ho rahi he
 In fact, in this ad, Khaliko has been shown to be very powerful that if he collides with any of the walls, the whole wall is broken, even his weight gets transformed into the soil
 lekin sirf ambuja cement se bani divaar yaa ghar hi unke baari bharkam sharir kaa saamana kar pate hai
 Viewers are very fond of this style in the ad ab tak is aid ke video ko kareeb 8 lakh se zyada log dekh chuke hai
 He has done many advertisements before but his latest ad is being well liked
 dekhen da great khali kaa phani aid: Can you imagine a child who never cries? yah baat aapako jarur hairaan kar rahi hogi ki kya koi aisa baccha ho saktaa he, jo kabhi rota hi naa ho
 Yes, we are telling you about such a child, never cried since birth
 yahaan tak ki chot lagane par yaa maa-papa se daant sunne ke baad bhi use ronaa nahin aata
 The name of this child is Dexter Cahill and he will be 4 years old on this Saturday
 jis tarah yah baat aapako hairaan kar rahi he, usee tarah dextor kahil ke mata-pita ko bhi hairaani hoti thi
 The extent was reached when Dexter's leg broke and he did not even realize the pain
 darasal, dextor ko ek genetic disoder he, jisaki vajah se use dard kaa ehsaas nahin hota
 Even after breaking his leg, Dexter had no idea that his leg was broken
 isi tarah dance class main teacher bacchon ko dance sikhaa rahi thi or dextor ati utsaah main kuuda or uski pindli kii haddi tut gai
 Dexter could not stand, but despite this, he did not tear his eyes nor did he scream out of pain
 is baat se dextor kii teacher bhi hairaan thi
 The teacher calls Dexter's mother and is taken to the hospital
 vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki dextor ek vishesh tarah ke dysorder kaa shikaar he
 This is called hereditary sensory autonomy neuropathy type 4
 yah dysorder 125 million logon main ek ko hoti he
 It is rare disorder
 is dysorder main vyakti ko dard kaa anubhav nahin hota
 It can also prove to be dangerous at times
 vaigyanikon ke anusaar is dysorder main dard kaa pataa nahin chalata isliye sharir main atarik rup se kuch bhi ho rahaa ho to iskaa pataa lagaana mushkil ho jaataa he
 Dexter's parents are about to take a house that is open-ended to save him from injury

 You will open the button and walk

 real estate regulatory athurity yani RERA ne pehali baar projects ko khud puraa karne kaa bidaa uthaane kii disha main kadam badaye hai
 Taking a strong decision, RERA has issued show cause notices to de-register 7 projects
 ab developers ke jawaab milane par rera in projects ko deregister karne kaa faisla karegaa
 These 7 projects include Primrose Infratech of Greater Noida, Project Primrose Rhine, PCA Impex Sampada Leviya, MSA Developer's Circuit Heights Green Bay Infrastructure's Green Bay Golf Homes and Golf Village
 mist diarect cells privet limited ke project festival city ke teenon fez, unnati fortune ke project aranya ke paanchon fez or intilecity project ke teen phej is deregister list main shaamil hai
 If these projects are deregistered, then RERA will try 3 options to complete them
 pehla vikalp he ki kisi ko-develper ko laakar in projects ko puraa karne kii jimmedaari di jaae to aisi surat main ko-develper ghar kharidaaron se bakaayaa rakam lekar bache hue project ko puraa karegaa or jameen kaa bakaayaa sambandhit vikaas praadhikaran ko chukaayegaa
 However, there may be a difficulty in this that if more money is required to complete the work and less amount can be recovered from the home buyers, then the home buyers may be asked to pay additional amount
 ghar kharidaar agar iske liye raji naa hue to wo court ja sakate hai or project dobaaraa atak saktaa he
 With this, RERA may pressurize the first builder to collect the money from home buyers
 doosraa tarika ye ho saktaa he ki ghar kharidaaron ko khud hi project puraa karne ke liye kaha jaae
 Home buyers can start their own project by building an association, but for this a large section of home buyers will need approval
 iske pehle oktober main rera ne shubhakamana group ke ek project ke ghar kharidaaron ko ye mauka diya tha lekin abhi tak usapar ghar kharidaar koi faisla nahin kar paae hai
 a third way could be by canceling the land of the project and giving the authority anew to the new buyer
 is surat main nayaa alotment mahange rate par hone kii surat main ghar kharidaaron ko rifund mil saktaa he yaa wo nae develper ke saath nai sharton ke tahat jud sakate hai
 However, these three options are tried only by looking at the condition of the project
 cancil karne kaa vikalp vahiin lagu ho saktaa he jahaan par nammaatr kaa kaam hua he

 Mohammad said that he will not be extradited as long as he is not creating any problem in our country

 Devendra Fadnavis is facing the biggest political crisis in Maharashtra during his three-year tenure as Chief Minister
 ugr dalit andolanon or apper cast rhite wing hindutv kii aakraamakata main fanse fadanvis ke liye aane dinon main bhi raahat kii ummid nahin dikh rahi he
 According to the news of Times of India, the fire which is burning in the heart of Maharashtra is going to increase the difficulties of Fadnavis
 maratha mahasang agle maheene se aarakshan ko lekar apana andolan dobaaraa shuru karne kii taiyaari main he
 According to political analysts, the demand of the Maratha community is also that the Atrocities Act should be relaxed
 isaki vajah se dalit sanghathanon main ubaal he
 On the other hand, BJP insiders believe that Sharad Pawar's party is creating problems for NCP Devendra Fadnavis
 ensipi ke liye yah aasaan bhi he kyonki fadanvis brahman samudaay se aate hai
 According to a BJP leader, NCP is playing the Maratha card to promote caste politics in Maharashtra
 haalanki dalit sanghathan bijepi kii is baat se sahamat nahin he
 Arjun Dangle, chief strategist of Dalit Jan Shakti Sangathan, does not seem to agree with these allegations of BJP
 unhone pavaar ke khilaaf aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki sharad pavaar hi pehle shaks the, jinhone saamaajik sauhaard banaae rakhane kii apil kii
 Earlier, for Devendra Fadnavis, issues related to farmers have been taking the exam
 chaahe wo maamla vidarbha main sookhe kaa ho yaa kisaanon kii aatmahatya or karjamaafee kaa
 The Fadnavis government somehow handled the case by waiving the farmer debt
 haalanki is mudde par use apni hi sahyogi party shivasena ke prakope kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 But recently the issue of caste violence is more dangerous than farmer debt waiver
 jatiyon ke bich takaraav kii keemat fadanvis or bijepi ko baari pad sakati he
 According to sources, there are two major concerns for the BJP
 pehali ye ki daliton ne buudhvaar ko rajya bhar main apni takat kaa pradarshan kiya he
 Life came to a standstill in districts like Pune, Satara, Kolhapur, Jalgaon, Aurangabad and Konkan
 ye sabhi ilaake bijepi, congress, shivasena or ensipi jaisi partiyon ke garh hai
 Secondly, the manner in which the incidents of ethnic violence have increased in the state, there are lines of concern on the bjp's forehead
 jaateey hinsa ek tareeke se gramin mudda mana jaataa rahaa he, lekin buudhvaar ke maharashtra band ne mumbai ko ghanton roke rakhaa
 According to reports, BJP president Amit Shahpoor is monitoring the case
 ye mana ja rahaa he ki party haikaman ne devendra fadanvis ko is baat kaa nirdesh diya ki puure maamle main shanti se nipta jaae
 This is the reason why the Mumbai Police did not take strict action against the Dalit protesters
 rajya sarkaar kii koshish thi ki dalit kaa aakrosh sadak par nikal jaae
 However, many in the BJP itself believe that the party is paying the price of not cutting the flag bearers of Hindutva

 a Chinese official newspaper said on Monday that India's refusal to participate in China's high-profile 'belt and Road' initiative is "regrettable" but the boycott of New Delhi's cooperation between its neighbors for infrastructure development Will not be affected at all
 do divasiy ‘belt and road forum’ main pakistan samet 29 deshon ke netaa bhaag le rahe hai
 India has boycotted it due to sovereignty concerns over the $ 50 billion china-pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) passing through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 ‘global times’ ne kaha, ‘‘bharat ne haal hi main ek adhikarik bayaan jari kiya he ki vah ‘van beld and van road’ (bi and aar) pahal kaa hissaa nahin hoga lekin isse dhanchaagat vikaas ke liye iske padosi deshon ke bich sahyog sambandhi rukh katai prabhavit nahin hoga

 yadi iske baavjood bharat bi and aar ke prati apni kadaa virodh barkaraar rakhata he to yah khedjanak he lekin yah koi samasya nahin he
 Referring to a statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs on March 13, a day before the B&R conference, the newspaper said that India also mentioned the potential debt burden in its concerns and said, "connectivity initiatives" Should follow the principles of financial responsibility so as to avoid projects that create unreasonable debt burden for communities

 ’’ 'global Times' said, "india has recently issued an official statement that it will not be part of the 'one Beloved and One Road' (B&R) initiative, but it will lead to infrastructure development among its neighboring countries
" The approach to cooperation will not be affected at all
 ’’ samachar patr ne kaha, ‘‘bharat ne samaaroh kii shuruyaat se kuch ghanton pehle china ke belt and road forum (biref) ko lekar khulkar andeh vyakt kiya tha

" china ne baar baar kaha he ki sipiisi ke kaaran kashmir vivaad par uskaa rukh nahin badalegaa

 dilli-ensiaar main aparaadh hote rahe hai
 But the rapid cases of mass murder and suicide in the area have increased everyone in the last few days worrying about this new creepy trend
 pichley 15 dinon main ek-ek karke 3 parivaar khatm ho gaye
 In some, the father is left alone and in some there is no name
 sawaal yah he ki aakhir dilli-ensiaar ko ye kya ho gaya he? kyon log apane hi parivaar or apane ajijon ke khun ke pyaase ho rahe hai? aakhir kaise koi is tarah ke samuhik katl or khudakushi ke bare main soch bhi saktaa he?is puure silsile kii taaja vaardaat hui gajiabad ke musuri ilaake main, jahaan ek hi parivaar kii 3 bacchiyon or mata-pita kii maut ho gai
 The case is perhaps the most strange and shocking of all the three mass murders and suicide cases
 musuri ke new shatabdipuram colony main shuukravaar kii subah us vakt afra-tafari much gai, jab logon ko ek parivaar ke 5 logon ke katl kii khabar mili
 In a hurry, the police also reached the occasion
 kamare kaa darwaja andar se band tha to police ko darwaja todna padaa
 a family, 5 deaths and a riddle of black tape inside the scene was so terrible that even the policemen were blown away at first sight
 kamare main ek bed par 3, 5 or 8 saal kii 3 betiyon or pita kii laash padi thi, jabaki usee bed par khun se sani bacchiyon kii maa ab bhi tapad rahi thi
 The woman was immediately sent to the hospital , who later died
 mauka-e-vaardaat par ek hathaudaa padaa tha, jisase mahila ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Although all the three girls had a black tape on their mouths, but too much tape was wrapped on the nose and mouth of the girls' father and it seemed that except for the mother, probably all of the deaths were due to the knee wrapping tape

 vaise to khudakushi kaa ye tarika apane-aap main behad ajeeb or chaunkaanewaala he, kyonki kisi ke khud hi apane munh par tepe chipkaakar khudakushi karne kii baat aamtaur par sunai nahin padati
 But since the room here was closed from inside and the neighbors did not see anyone coming and going, the police suspect that after killing their daughters and wife, the man also committed suicide by sticking tape on his mouth
 shaq par samuhik hatya!police kii maane to 42 saal kaa pradeep yahaan apni patni sangeeta (40) or 3 betiyon manasvee (8), yashasvi (5) or ojasvi (3) ke saath pichley kai saalon se rah rahaa tha
 Pradeep was an alcoholic and was also undergoing treatment at the Dedication Center
 use apni patni ke chaal-chalan par bhi shaq tha
 In such a situation, it seems that he killed the whole family
 gajiabad ke esaspi sudhir kumaar singh ne kaha, 'hamen maukey se pradeep kaa likhaa ek suicide note mila he, jisamen usne bivi ke chaal-chalan par shaq jataate hue khudakushi kii baat likhi he
 However, we are still investigating the whole matter
 'ek hi parivaar main 5 logon kii moutkhaufnak kadam ke kaaran alag-algaek chaunkaanewaali baat yah bhi he ki puure parivaar ke khatme kii in dardanaak vaardaaton main ab tak har maamle main alag-alag vajahen saamne ai hai

 On the other hand, the lack of money in the case of murder and suicide of a very rich family of 4 people in Gurugram came to the fore
 kul milakar, samuhik katl or khudakushi ke ye maamle beshak ek jaise hon, lekin vajahon ke maamle main ye vaakye alag-alag kism ke hai
 The story of the murder of the bloody father in Mehrauli in Ghaziabad, where the story of the death of the entire family due to the suspicion of the wife's conduct so far, has been revealed

 Preliminary investigation here also revealed that financial constraints were the major reason

 Overall here, these cases of mass murder and suicide are undoubtedly the same, but in terms of reasons, these sentences are different, but financial tightness, cynicism and depression are common in all these deaths

 jaise-jaise upi chunaav najadik aa rahe hai, bijepi ke vaicharik paramarshdaata 'rashtriya swayamsevak sangh' dwaara kiye gaye prayaas faldaayi hote dikh rahe hai
 Along with increasing its branches in UP, the Sangh is now going to inspire its young colleagues through a program on the lines of ancient Greece
 swayamsevakon ko or behatar bana rahaa he sanghagunatmak sanchaalan naam ke ek prakalp (program) ke jariye aresas apane swayamsevakon ko kadam dar kadam marshall art, sanghathanaatmak kshamta badhaane or shaikshik rup se or majboot badhaane ke liye kavita, dibet or vigyaan sikhayega
 Kripa Shankar, the region's province publicity chief, told Mail Today Ko that the Sangh is working towards connecting the youth with their ideology
 unhone kaha, 'sangh apni vichaardhaara se sahamat yuvaaon main se sabase behtareen yuvaaon ko pahchaanane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 After which we will improve them further
 ye ham apane yuva swayamsevakon kii kshamta ko jaanane ke liye kar rahe hai
 We have created parameters based on many competitive activities such as martial arts, poetry and singing of Sangha prayer on the basis of which we will judge them
 'unhone aage bataaya ki upi main pichley teen saalon main shakhaon kii sankhya main bhi lagaataar badhottaree dekhne ko mili he
 As the RSS has always said, they will not contest elections
 sangh khud ko hameshaa se hi rajnatik nahin balki saanskrithik sanghathan bataata aayaa he
 However, the Sangh has been providing grassroots activists to its political wing BJP
 jis tarah se upi main aresas kii shakhaon main lagaataar badhottaree ho rahi he uskaa bijepi ko nishchit taur par phayda milegaa
 According to Kripa Shankar, the number of branches in UP has increased from 44,996 to 56,859 since 2013-14
 2013-14 se 2014-15 tak upi main shakhaon kii sankhya 15 fisadi kii badhottaree ke saath 44,996 se badhkar 51,332 tak pahunchi thi
 If this data is compared with the figures so far this year, by the beginning of the month of May, there has been a jump of 10% in the total number of branches
 is badhottaree kii khaas baat yah he ki sangh inke jariye ab bispi chif mayawati ke votbank par nishaanaa saadh rahaa he
 Significantly, the Sangh has divided its branches into two parts, students and businessmen
 aankadon ko dekhen to vidhyaarthiyon vaali shakha main vyavsaayiyon vaali shakha se zyada oochaal aayaa he
 The number of student branches in 2013-14 was 29,295 while the number of business branches was 15,701
 vahiin is saal ab tak ye sankhya badhkar kramash: 37,308 or 19,551 ho chuki he
 Last year, there has been a jump of 15 per cent in student branches and 10 per cent this year
 jabaki vyavsaayee shakhaon main pichley saal or is saal ab tak lagbhag 12 fisadi kaa oochaal darj kiya gaya he

 The COA has drafted the BCCI constitution keeping in mind the recommendations of the Lodha Committee
 unhone saath hi usamen sabhi hitdharakon ke suzav bhi shaamil kiye hai
 Legislatures are not like Parliament in terms of disclosure of assets and liabilities
 desh bhar kii 29 vidhansabhaon (jammu-kashmir ko chhodkar) main kul vidhayakon kii sankhya 4,033 he
 Of these, only in Kerala, Karnataka, Uttarakhand and Tripura, there is a provision to give details of assets and financial liabilities to the Speaker of the Assembly
 jin rajyon main vidhanparishaden hai, unki jaankaree isamen shaamil nahin he
 Not surprisingly, most of the Assembly Secretariats kept silence on our RTI application or kept forwarding it from there
 karnataka lokayukta kanoon, 1984- jo 15 janvari, 1986 ko lagu hua- kii dhara 22 ke mutabik, vidhayak ko har saal 30 june se pehle aisa vivaran dena hota he
 Giving details of the process, the Karnataka Legislative Secretariat said, "most of the members are giving details
" koi difolter nahin he
 "the Kerala Legislative Assembly's reply was," According to the Kerala Public Commissioners Act and the Kerala Public Commissioners (reporting of Property) Rules, 1999, it is necessary for members of the Assembly to give details of their assets and financial liabilities
 yah kanoon 4 march, 1999 ko lagu hua
 Kerala Raj Bhavan said that only three mlas have not given details of the property
 uttarakhand main bhi aise niyam hai, par 70 main se 61 to difolter hi hai
 Though the Orissa Assembly has passed a code of conduct for its 147 mlas, it has clarified that only one MLA has implemented it
 saaf he ki zyaadaatar vidhansabhaon main sansad kii tarah sadasyon kii sampatti-dendariyon kaa khulaasa karne ko baadhya karne vaala koi kanoon nahin he
 This is the fact of Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Bihar, Goa, Puducherry, Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and north-eastern states (except for the Tripura, which declared the state legislature-property and liabilities-law, 2006 Mandatory information is sought)
 It is clear from the replies of our application sent in the secretariats of the legislatures
 vahiin, andhra pradesh vidhansabha ne abhi koi jawaab nahin diya
 So the Punjab Assembly Secretariat sent the application to the Department of Parliamentary Affairs, to which the reply has come that it does not have such information
 yani, artiai kaa prayog kar rahe jigyaasuon ke liye yah to 'aplai vid no ripli' (aavedan lekin jawaab nahin) kaa maamla he
 Also, the silence and misleading answers of many states also shows that nobody is bothered about the provisions of the RTI Act
 par asli sawaal yah he ki mananeey vidhayak log chune jane ke baad jo kuch arjeet karte hai, uskaa byora logon ko kaise pataa chalegaa? There are two Chaturthi in each month, which is believed to be the date of Lord Ganesha
 do main se ek jo amavasya ke baad aane vaali shukla paksh kii chaturthi ko vinayak chaturthi kehete hai or poornima ke baad aane vaali krishna paksh kii chaturthi ko sankashti chaturthi kehete hai
 The biggest obstacles can easily be avoided by worshiping Lord Ganesha
 isiilie inhen vighnvinashak bhi kehete hai
 Lord Ganesha is considered the first and foremost of all the gods
 koi bhi mantra jaap anushthan ganesh ji kii puja ke bina safal nahin hota he
 That is why the glory of Vinayaka Chaturthi is very important in our scripture
 kaise karen vinayak chaturthi par bhagwaan ganesh kii puja archana-- subah ke samay jaldi uthakar snaan aadi karke laal rang ke vastra dhaaran karen or surya bhagwaan ko tambe ke lote se arghya den
 - Then take a coiled coconut and modak as prasad in Lord Ganesha's temple
 - unhen gulab ke phool or durva arpan karen tathaa gan ganapatye namah mantra kaa 27 baar jaap karen tathaa dhoop deep arpan karen
 According to your ability, install a Ganesh idol made of brass, copper, clay or gold or silver in your house during the afternoon worship
 sankalp ke baad pujan kar shri ganesh kii aarti karen tathaa modak bacchon ke baat den
 Worship Vinayaka Ganesha to get the stopped money - On Ganesh Chaturthi, take bath in the morning and wear clean clothes and worship Ganesha
 - bhagwaan ganesh ko durva ko baandhakar maala banaakar arpit karen
 Also, offer pure ghee and jaggery to them and then chant the "vakratundaya Hoon" mantra 54 times
 - dhan laabh kii prarthana karen
 After a while, feed ghee and jaggery to the cow or give it to a poor person, money problems will go away
 - aisa lagaataar paanch vinayak chaturthi par karen
 By doing this, you will definitely get your stalled money
 sari baadha or sankaton ke naash ke liye karen upaay-- subah ke samay pile vastra dhaaran karke bhagwaan ganesh ke samaksh baithen unke saamne ghi kaa choumukhi deepak jalaaen
 - Keep laddus equal to your age, then offer all the laddus one by one and keep chanting "bal" mantra with each laddu
 - iske baad baadha dur karne kii prarthana karen or ek laddu swayan kha len or baaki laddu baant den
 - Recite Lord Suryanarayana's sunset 3 times in front of Ganesha
 pichley ek sitambar se desh main sanshodhit yatayaat niyam lagu kar die gaye hai
 The amount of the penalty under the new traffic rules has also been increased several times than before
 nayaa trephic rule lagu hone ke baad yatayaat police or local police ne yatayaat niyam todane waalon ke khilaaf karrwai bhi shuru kar di
 Along with this, the Yogi government in Uttar Pradesh has issued a decree that double fine will be charged on the policemen who break the traffic rules
 isi ke maddenjar 'ajtak' kii team ne upi ke alag alag hisson main is baat kaa reality check kiya ki kya ve log bhi trephic niyamon kaa paalan kar rahe hai jinke upar trephic niyamon ko paalan karne kii jimmedaari he?'ajtak' kii team sabase pehle varanasi shahar main nikali or apane camere main un tasveeron ko kaid kiya jinamein police ke jawan hi yatayaat niyamon kii dhajjiyaan udaate dikhe
 Without a helmet, as soon as a policeman was about to move, his Sitti Pitti got lost while looking at the camera
 ye poochne par ki helmet kyon nahin lagaae, iske jawaab main pulicekarmi ne kaha, abhi turant aayaa hum or saathi helmet lekar aa rahaa he
 On asking the paper and DL of the bike, they kept showing up and kept on promising to get the fancy number plate corrected soon
 ajtak ke camere ne isi tarah kii do or tasveeron ko varanasi main kaid kiya jinamein pulicekarmi yatayaat niyamon kaa ulanghan karte dikhaai die or poochne par bahaane banane lage
 After Varanasi, the team of 'aaj Tak' reached Sangam city Prayagraj
 yahaan par bhi kai pulicekarmiyon ko trephic niyamon kii dhajjiyaan udaate hue dekha gaya
 When the bike-ridden policemen were caught by the 'aajtak' team without wearing helmets, they were stunned and the soldier sitting on the back of the bike grabbed the helmet in the hands of the soldier riding the bike
 iske bare main jab unase poocha gaya to ve bina jawaab die bhaag khadey hue
 The same bike-riding policeman without a helmet made an excuse to break Hamlet when he was asked to follow traffic rules and not to wear a helmet
 yahi haal audyogic nagari kanpur kaa bhi rahaa
 Here too, many such policemen were caught in the camera of 'aaj Tak' which appeared in violation of traffic rules
 yahaan par aise kai pulicekarmi mili jinhone na to helmet pahana, na hi gadiyon main seat belt lagaaya tha
 When the reporter of 'aaj Tak' asked these policemen, they all started making different excuses
 barabanki or aligarh main bhi pulicekarmi trephic niyamon ko todate hue 'ajtak' ke camere main kaid hue
 When the 'aaj Tak' team did a reality check at Barabanki's busiest Naka intersection and Patel intersection, many policemen who broke traffic rules were caught on camera without wearing helmets
 vahiin aligarh main bhi yatayaat niyamon ko paalan na karte pulicekarmi paae gaye
 Here, a darog got caught in the camera of 'aaj Tak' without putting a seat belt in his personal car
 poochne par koi jabaab nahin diya or haath se munh chhupaakar baithe rahe

 haalanki congressnith sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) ne is suzav ko khaarij kar diya
 Let it be known that Advani wrote a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and placed this demand before him
 karunanidhi ne ek bayaan jari kar mangalvaar ko kaha, "main bhi patr ke masaude se sahamat hum
 This idea came from an opposition party, so it cannot be sidelined

 dilli main aaj sipiem paulitte beuro kii baithak honi he
 After the victory in Kerala and the drubbing in Bengal, there is talk of tremendous churn in the CPM Politburo meeting today
 vidhansabha chunaav ke baad paulitte beuro kii yah pehali baithak he
 The meeting will mainly focus on the party's desperate defeat in Bengal
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki bengal main congress ke saath party ke gathbandhan ke faisale se kuch sadsy kaafii naaraaz hai jisaki vajah se aaj kii baithak main gahamagahami rahane kii ummid he
 This is the first meeting of the Politburo after the Assembly elections
 baithak mukhya rup se bengal main hui party kii karaari haar par kendrit rahegi
 It is being told that some members are very angry with the decision of the party's alliance with the Congress in Bengal, due to which the meeting is expected to be very loud
 ek sawaal
 Who would you choose to understand the politics of this era: Chaudhary Virendra Singh, who is the general secretary of the Congress Party and in charge of Delhi, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, or Mirza Asadullah, the poet-philosopher of urdu-persian during the sunset of the Mughal Empire To Khan Nangalib? The question is baffling, and the election too awkward
 agar aap choudhary ko chunate hai, to aapkaa faisla munasib he
 It is different that in this era of stressful existence, Mirza can be more helpful
 kaise? aaie, sabooton par gaur farmaate hai
 The Congress confirmed its fall by losing the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections on 17 April
 usee roj choudhary virendra singh ne tivi par hawabaji kar daali ki galati darasal voter kii thi; voter ko pataa hi nahin tha ki vah kya kar rahaa he
 There were no elections in Ghalib's time, a hundred and fifty years ago, and even if it were, they might not have voted, but they were very aware of the comfort in the world of ideas
 tabhi unhone kaha thah hamako maaloom he jananath kii hakeekat lekin / dil ke bahalane ko gaalib ye khyal acha he
 Chaudhary knows the reality well, but just one thought lightens his heart
 philhal, unke liye yahi badi raahat he
 Actually, politics is a practical art
 isamen bhram paalane kii sajaa milti he
 Here there is a fine line between demeaning and punishing oneself
 koi bhi siyasatdan agar maan le ki uski haar kii vajah voter kii galati he, to samajhie, uske pairon ke neeche se jameen khisak chuki he
 No election is small, because the voter is always important, whether it is choosing a big government or a small one
 shrimati gandhi kii 1977 main bhayankar haar ke baad desh ke mood badalane kaa pehla sankawt uttar bharat main hue sthaneey chunaavon se mila tha jisamen congress jiti thi
 His opponents of the Janata Party blew it in the air, saying that it was a speck on the face
 ve bhul gaye ki akasar ek daag hi bhitari cancer kaa pataa detaa he
 There is a similar relationship between the Municipal Corporation elections of Delhi and the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh that people's discontent has become a storm
 isaki jad kharaab prashasan or rajnatik kuprabandhan ke dohare jokhim main he
 It is ready to throw the Congress away from the position of power where it has always been relaxed
 bahaane uttar pradesh main bhi nahin chale the, dilli main bhi ve kaam nahin aaenge
 There was a lot of publicity in Uttar Pradesh that the party organization was absent there
 yahi sanghathan to mote taur par 2009 main bhi tha jab congress loksabhaa chunaav main 21 siten lekar ai thi
 The network would not have collapsed by 2012
 chunki rahul gandhi ne isi jameen main khaad-pani daalane kaa kaam teen saal tak lagaataar kiya, lekin inhen teen barason main congress kaa vot chah fisadi se bhi zyada neeche aa gaya
 There was an uproar within the party as the ground of his trust had been shattered
 agar aap satta main hai, to voter aapke pradarshan se hi aapke daavon ko jaanchataa he
 Rahul Gandhi single-handedly captured the election campaign in Uttar Pradesh
 congress kii jeet par jisaki puja hoti, haarane par bhi usee ko jimmedaar tehraaya janaa chahie, lekin dosha akele unka nahin
 Rahul Gandhi was handicapped by the UPA alliance, floating in the morass of corruption and inflating the cost of living on the hollow bones of promises
 chunki unhone hi uttar pradesh main congress kaa cheharaa hona sweekaar kiya tha, so tamaacha bhi unheen ke gaal par padaa
 Had they not been in the campaign, the Congress would have got similar results
 baat yah nahin ki rahul gandhi ke aane se fark nahin padaa, balki yah he ki ve fark daal nahin sake
 And for an organization that runs with dynastic blood, this confession is very dangerous
 lihaaja, congress ko bahaanon kii jarurat aan padati he
 There is another reason for excuses
 vajood sirf jismani maamla nahin hota, uske liye khayalon kii sej bhi chahie hoti he
 While almost half the Union Cabinet rests on the permanent smile of a person who won the power lottery, the Ministers of the 40s and 50s who are in the age of 40 are gradually becoming victims of depression and anxiety
 inamen se adhiktar aath saal se bina tarakkee ke vahiin atake pade hai
 For him, this idea is as bad as being lost in a jungle because in 2009, he had assumed that he had got the license to rule for 20 years
 agar agle aam chunaav se pehle inkaa naitik bal chook gaya, to jang main hataahaton kii sankhya badhani tay he
 Clearly, they needed to be assured that the real problem was the situation, not the leadership; Things will change over time, but leadership cannot change
 jeet nasha paidaa karti he
 It also has a hangover
 upie-2 abhi khumaari kii haalat main he
 Haar teaches a lesson, but he has to be honest
 tivi par machi chunavi bhagdad main ho saktaa he, choudhary ke khyal kuch der ke liye haar ke jakhm par maraham kaa kaam kar jaaen
 But in the long run, you have to believe the things of Nangalib
 dilli ke nagar nigam chunaav or uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav ke bich ek hi rishta he, ki logon kaa asantosh ab tufaan ban chukaa he
 Its roots lie in the double crisis of poor governance and political mismanagement
 yah congress ko satta kii us masanad se utaar phenkane ko taiyaar he jahaan use hameshaa se sukun miltaa rahaa he
 You want to follow the path of religion but do not know what is right and wrong according to religion, what will you do? Do what the 33-year-old Farzana Khan did
 ve jaananaa chaahati thim ki pati par unhone jo kharch kiya he, kya unhen use waapas paane kaa adhikaar he? unhone shahar ke mufti ke paas jane kii bajaae internet par maujuud fatwa online website kii madad lee or agle choubees ghante main jawaab maujuud tha
 Faraz Khan also went through a site called Islamweb that cheating in exams is wrong
 faraj kehete hai, ''phir maine kabhi cheeting nahin kii
 He would have been hesitant to ask this question to the city mufti and perhaps he would have found the question absurd as well
 itnaa to tay he ki jawaab nahin miltaa
 "there are a lot of websites like Islam Online, Askaim, onislam, Fatwa Online and Islamweb which give Muslims answers to fatwa or their religion questions
 in websitïsa kii khaasiyat yah he ki fatwa dene vaale zyaadaatar mufti hajaaron kimi dur videsh main hai
 By the last few years, many Indian sites giving online edicts have also come
 daarul ulum devband kii bhi daarul iftaa naam se apni fatwa site he
 Fatwa Online is run by Mufti Ejaz Arshad Kasami of Delhi
 is website par har roj lagbhag 200 sawaal puche jate hai jinke jawaab kaasmi or 10 logon kii team milakar detii he
 "there is no harm in learning about religion through the Internet," says Kasami
 yah to ek aasaan or behatar jariya he
 "28-year-old Fiza Zafar wanted to know if it was allowed to make eyebrows in Islam
 fatwa online ne unhen bataaya ki yah gaiyr-islamic he
 In this way fatwa sites are not only increasing the information related to religion, but are also proving helpful in changing the thinking about fatwas
 jaisaa ki bhopal ke naayab kaaji sayed babar hossain nadvi kehete hai, ''fatwa aadesh nahin he
 Rather it means that you asked the question and the one in front answered it
 ''fatve kii itani sari cites main se kisase sawaal poochna sahi he, yah pataa lagaana aasaan nahin he
 "you have to see who the fatwas are
" '' masalan ismalaonline ko das lakh se zyada log har maah dekhte hai kyonki isse misr ke islamic vidwaan usoof karajavi jude hai
 Due to fatwa websites people are also getting freedom to ask such questions related to personal life which they could not ask the religious leader
 yani 'fatwa' shabd aazaadee kaa paryaay banataa ja rahaa he
 The battle between Akhilesh and Shivpal Yadav did not end last year

 lekin donon ke bich jari manmutav ke bich samaajawaadee party ne dalbadal virdohi kanoon ke aadhaar par shivpal singh yadav kii vidhansabha sadsyta khatm karne ke liye yachika lagaai he
 Uncle Shivpal split from the Samajwadi Party last year after a long struggle between Akhilesh and Shivpal and formed his new party called 'progressive Samajwadi Party'
 unki nai party 'pragatisheel samaajawaadee party' ne pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav main hissaa bhi liya, lekin use koi kamyaabi hasil nahin hui

 n'golo Kante, who plays for English football club Chelsea, has been voted the best player of the year by the Football Writers Association

 If the directors of the World Bank Group vote in his favor, he will replace Jim Yong Kim as President of the World Bank
 gauratlab he ki america kaa varchasv world bank main kaaphi adhik he, isliye is pad par aam taur par america naagarik hi asin hote aae hai
 The post of Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund is for Europe
 vishwa bank main vibhinn deshon ke vot ko dhyaan main rakhte hue malpas ke naam kii pushti mahaj ek aupchaarikta he
 Announcing the nomination of Malpas, the US President described him as a "special person" and a person who is well qualified for the post
 koun hai david malpas ?aapako bataa den ki antarrashtriya maamalon ke liye vitt apper sachiv ke taur par 62 varshiya malpas antarrashtriya mudra kosh or vishwa bank kaa kaamkaaj dekhte hai
 Internationally renowned economist Malpas has 40 years of experience in economics, finance, government and foreign policy
 2016 ke chunaav ke dauraan malpas donald trump ke aarthik salaahkaar rahe the
 Having received a degree in International Economics from Georgetown University's prestigious School of Foreign Service with several presidents, Malpas served as Deputy Assistant Finance Minister under former President Ronald Reagan and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under former President George HW Bush
 Worked on the post of malpas ke naam kaa elaan karte hae trump ne kaha, ‘‘da waal street jarnal ne aaj ek sampadakeey main kaha ki david malpas behtareen pasand hai

 With the UP elections approaching, the state seems to be the arena of political competition
 pradhanmantri narendra modi congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi donon ne guuruuvaar ko upi main reliyaan kii
 While PM Modi rallied in Varanasi in his parliamentary constituency and retaliated heavily on Rahul Gandhi's allegations, Rahul Gandhi again responded to PM in Bahraich rally
 ye pramukh mudde rahe jinpar rahul gandhi or piem modi ke bich takkar dekhne ko mila
 The rally to be held at Ball Ghar Maidan of District Headquarters in Bahraich has been named as Janakrosh Rally by the Congress Party
 party kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi notebandi ke khilaaf janata ko ho rahi takalif ke khilaaf lagaataar sangharsh kar rahe hai
 The Baramunda plain is often barren on the side of a busy road connecting the south-western outskirts of Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha
 11 farvari yani mangalvaar ko is maidan par ek tilism kaa kabja ho gaya, jo kushalta ke daawey ke bainks daivatv kaa vaada karata he
 Something very special is going to happen here in the next few hours
 hajaaron logon ke maidan kii taraf badhate kadamon ne sara bhed khol diya
 Saffron is becoming darker and darker among the hats, scarves and flags being distributed along the way
 ye ve uktaae hue gaanv vaale nahin hai, jinhen sthaneey netaa bason main bharkar ek din ke liye shahar le aae hai
 They have come swinging on a bean
 ve gaanaa chaahate hai or chillaanaa chaahate hai, kyonki vah shahar main aa rahaa he
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP and undoubtedly the most controversial leader of modern India, has created a personality of his own, which few leaders have been able to do before him
 jab ve bhubaneshwar main 'vijay sankalp samabesh’ main apni ek-ek pankti ke jumale darshakon kii taraf uchhaalate hai, to unka josh shabdon main nahin baandha ja saktaa
 Modi is either a rockstar, giving his fans a tune to sing along with, or someone who captivates a passionate public crowd
 aap chaahe jis bhi najar se dekhen, dilli se tiruvanantpuram or mumbai se guwahati tak ve jis shahar main jate hai, modi rashtradhyaksh jaisi shaan dikhaate hai
 It cannot be said now whether this attraction will actually take the form of a mandate
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki modi aisa prachaar kar rahe hai, jo bharat main kabhi nahin hua
 The fine detail of this propaganda is decided with great skill
 netaa, kaaryakarta, swayamsevak or peshewar log ek hokar kaam karte hai, har raat labalab bheed ke saamne bajaane vaale sangeet premi orcestra kii tarah dhun chhedate hai
 The message may still be debated, but its delivery has now taken the form of art
 jab se modi ko pichley sitambar main bijepi ne pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya he, tab se unki kor team or shuru main unhen ubhaarne main hichakati party kii mashinari ek lakshya ke liye ekajute ho gai hai, jaise koi jaik yuasabi port se jud jaataa he
 His tussle with senior leaders is now back on track
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne apana anubhav, apni jaankaree or rajya ikaayiyon kii sanghathan shakti modi ke haathon main saunp di he
 In the last five months, candidate Modi has addressed 78 rallies and covered 45,339 km distance
 aane vaale do maheenon main unka kaarykram or vyast hota chalaa jayega
 If you look closely at Modi's campaign, his mausoleum seems to be spread over many Indian cities
 unke rajnatik chif of staff uttar pradesh ke liye bijepi ke chunaav pramukh kii haisiyat se lakhanu main virajman hai, to dilli main party kaa ity cell mumbai, gandhinagar, ahmedabad or dilli main bane alag war room se rajyon main netaaon ko sanchaalan or jamini samarthan miltaa he, jo unhen jamini sachaai se rou-ba-rou karaane kaa kaam karte hai
 All these sources of Modi's Administrative Chief of Staff in Gandhinagar

 Kailashanathan, a 1979 batch IAS officer, has been his Chief Principal Secretary since he retired last May
 aam chunaav kii taraf badhate hue ummidavaar modi bijepi ke alag-alag hisson ke kul yoga se bhi bade ho gaye hai
 Insider surveys of the party in Tamil Nadu show that 45 percent of the people want to see Modi as Prime Minister, while only 15 percent will vote for BJP
 isliye prachaar kaa sandesh he ki party ke liye vot sthaneey ummidavaaron ko nahin, sidhe modi ko jaaenge
 Modi is wearing many caps - Vikas Purush, tea-maker, backward class boy
 inamen se koi ling, jati yaa varg jo chaahe chun saktaa he
 He is sometimes a leader of Hindutva, sometimes an agent of change and sometimes a young man at heart

 raily kii har jagah kaa chunaav modi kii team or bijepi ke purv adhyaksh em
 This is done thoughtfully after a discussion between a committee headed by Venkaiah Naidu to have the maximum impact across the country
 unke bhaashanon main is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki alag-alag tarah ke shrotaaon ko buniyadi bhaawanaaon se puri tarah joda jaae
 He reminds his listeners that he is the heir to a magnificent legacy
 sthaneey bhashaa main kuch panktiyon se shuruyaat hoti he, phir unki samasyaon kaa zikr hota he or mazaakia lahaze main unki sthiti kii tulana main bijepi shasit gujarat, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh jaise rajyon kii aaraam kii jindagi se hoti he
 Then in the last sixty years, the perceived ineffectiveness of Congress governments at the Center is exaggerated
 is tarah virodhiyon par chutkule chhodie kii hawa taiyaar hoti he or vaada kiya jaataa he ki agar unhen sirf saath maheene satta mil gai to bhavishya sunaharaa hoga
 Then the speech ends by loudly reminding the audience why they should be proud of themselves
 unhone bhubaneshwar main kaha ki main somnath kii bhoomi se jagannatha kii bhoomi main aayaa hum
 The gesture was towards the Jagannath temple in Puri
 modi dahaade 'jai jagannatha’ bheed ne or bhi josh se hunkaar bhari—'jai jagannatha

 None of these are party workers
 ye sab pichley chaar saal main vibhinn manchon se ity cell se jude hai
 They have been enabled and activated by literature and training and have been entrusted with the responsibility of the region, so that they can spread the message of Modi to every corner of India
 ve daan jamaa karte hai, manthan or chaay par charchaa karte hai or apni ilaakon ke samaan soch vaale vyaktiyon kaa acolpaneey databes taiyaar karne main party kii madad karte hai
 These like-minded individuals can join this army without any money
 en-dock sabase zyada 155 shahari siton par dhyaan de rahaa he
 The head of the cell, Arvind Gupta, calls them "digital seats" and Modi campaigners believe that they can be won on the basis of online forces
 inamen se harek seat ko kam se kam 5,000 'modi-fyres’ yaa 7,75,000 prashikshit prachaarkon kaa saath milegaa, jinke paas batch, aaidi card or parche honge
 The biggest thing in the words of Arvind Gupta is that he will be full of passion and determination

 Modi's speech writers include two dozen researchers, who sit in a small room in western Ahmedabad
 inamen ejeeniyar, scollar, iiem or anidi graduate hai, jo duusari agenciyon se talmail rakhte hai or kaagajon par tathy or sthaneey jaankaree modi ko bhejte hai, taaki ve agle raily sthal tak udaan ke dauraan unhen dekh saken
 His way of working was revealed before the Guwahati rally on 8 February
 research team se mili kaagajon ko kailashnathan ne taraasha or guwahati ke liye vimaan main savaar modi ko saunp diya
 After reading these notes in his 13-seater new jet, Modi asked his 33-year-old personal assistant Om Prakash Chandel to ask for some more information
 chaar ghante kii udaan ke dauraan modi ke 69 varshiya piaaro jagadish thakkar ne assam ke vishaal databes main se yah jaankaree juta lee
 Before landing in Guwahati, Modi had everything
 unke bhaashan ke mukhya mudde gujarati main bullate point main likhe hue the or sahaayak tathy aasaani se dekhne laayak dastavej main the, jise unhen kareeb 1,50,000 logon ke saamne pesh karnaa tha
 However, mocking Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's election to the Rajya Sabha from Assam, Modi said if the Prime Minister cannot do anything for those who sent him to Parliament, what will he do for the rest of the country
 bhubaneshwar main modi kii sthaneey samaj tab dikhaai di, jab unhone khuleam naveen patnayak sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa or aarope lagaaya ki mukhyamantri apane swargeey pita biju patnayak kii viraasat ko jhuthla rahe hai
 Biju Patnaik's name still resonates in the Fijas of Odisha
 modi ne kaha, ''naveen babu chaudaa saal se shashan kar rahe hai or aap ab bhi garib, berozegaar or pine ke pani ko taras rahe hai
 Who will bother the most
 ” phir jaraa thamkar bole, ''biju patnayak, ve aaj chaahe jahaan bhi hon, sabase zyada dukhi honge
 "it will not happen now, this is not the first time that the BJP has started such a big election campaign
 das saal pehle bijepi ke netritv vaali gathbandhan sarkaar ne apane duusare kaarykaal ke liye chunaav prachaar karte hue india shining (bharat udai) kaa daawa kiya tha
 At that time its leaders used to say that there is a lot of hope in the public about the Indian economy 
 ve bade garv se bataate the ki kis tarah logon ke vetan main teji se badhotaree ho rahi thi, vruddhi dar bahut zyada thi, share bazaar main teji thi or 2010 ke rashtramandal khelon kaa aayojan bharat ko mil gaya tha
 It was the party's over-zealous election campaign, led by fast-paced leader Pramod Mahajan
 chunaav prachaar ke nae-nae tareeke nikaale ja rahe the, jaise tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa record kiya hua phone kol, jo matadaataaon ke ek bade hisse ke paas aata tha
 Despite the predictions of a landslide victory, the BJP had to face defeat in the general election
 baad main party ne sweekaar kiya ki yah acha naaraa tha, lekin india shining ne us samay ke bharat kii kuch vaastaviktaaon ko jarur andekha kar diya tha
 It is said that burnt milk also drinks buttermilk
 aisa hi kuch bijepi ke saath bhi he
 The party says that Modi's election campaign is quite different from India Shining in terms of technical innovation and right aim
 chunaav prachaar kii yojana main shaamil varisht netaa kaa kahana he, ''yah pehla akhil bhartiya aadhunik chunaav prachaar he
 This time we know who we have to reach and how to reach
 ”bhubaneshwar main jab modi bhaashan de rahe the to ity cell ke 23 varshiya sadsy hitendra mehta mushkil se 30 foot dur apane laptop par lage hue the
 They were broadcasting the pictures of the main rally camera (ball-tracking camera in case of cricket) on yuvaitv through internet
 ise usee samay sampadit karke chote-chote clipon main utyub par bhi bheja ja rahaa tha
 The n-doc team directly tweeted some of Modi's key statements
 mehta or unke sahakarmi 23 varshiya amit aniruddh sahu unke thik bagal main baithe hue apane laptop par vyast the
 BJP volunteer photographers were constantly giving SD storage cards to Sahu so that he could tweet the best pictures
 is takneekee vyastata ke bich main hi gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke daftar se mehta ko ek phone aayaa or unase unke apane soshal media ke liye tasviren maangi gayi
 Modi's speech could also be heard on mobile phones through an automated number
 haalanki yah seva muft nahin he, lekin pichley chaar maheenon main das lakh se zyada log modi ke bhaashanon ko sun chuke hai
 Use of every volunteer Although such publicity through the media increases the impact of the rally many times, but the grassroots team of IT Cell is doing the most important work
 modi jab bhaashan de rahe hai to vah duusare swayamsevakon ko bhartee karne main vyast he
 a dozen members of the team, led by 38-year-old volunteer Rajesh Jain, are engaged in distributing pamphlets and cards in Bhubaneswar, which has been given a single number across the country
 modi ke samarthakon ko is number par whatsap, esemes yaa missd kol karne ke liye kaha jaataa he
 Members of sail's management team, led by 34-year-old banker Nitin Kashyap, then call back every supporter and ask them how much time they can devote to Modi's 4PM campaign
 is databes ko sthaan ke hisaab se bana liya jaataa he taaki bijepi ko pataa chal sake ki har nirvachan kshetra main unke paas kitne log seva dene ke liye uplabdh hai
 This data is sent to the Engagement Team, headed by Sunil Singh, a 32-year-old financial advisor
 ve in swayamsevakon ko prashikshan dekar unhen prachaar saamagree bhej dete hai
 They are then linked to the existing network of volunteers from that region
 har swayamsevi ikai report detii he ki usne us din kya kaam kiya
 This type of election campaign is similar to presidential campaigning in the United States, where Republican and Democrat election offices in small towns are run on the strength of volunteers and trainees
 modi ke chunaav prachaar main soshal media kaa istemaal baraak obama ke 2008 ke chunaav prachaar 'a change you can bilive in’ se prerit he, jisamen obama ke yuva samarthakon ne soshal media—jo us samay america ke liye bhi nai cheez thi—kaa bharpoor istemaal kiya tha or apane netaa ke paksh main lahar paidaa kar di thi
 This is also considered to be the reason for Obama's victory
 arvind gupta kehete hai, ''obama ke chunaav prachaar kii tarah hamane un sabhi 155 nirvachan kshetron main 5,000 daftar khol die hai, jahaan ham zyada dhyaan de rahe he
 BJP has huge support online
 ham ab swayamsevakon ke jariye is aadhaar kaa upyog kar rahe hai
 These Modi supporters (modifire) work for the 'modi 4 PM' donation fund, The Mission 272 campaign and 'vote 4 India' message and insist that every vote given in the Lok Sabha elections is there
 Not for the local candidate, but directly for Modi
 en-dock team ke ek mukhya sadsy hansate hue kehete hai, ''ham data taiyaar kar rahe hai, ab hamaare netaa usase janaadhar bana sakate hai
 "although he says he has supported every BJP leader, some volunteers admit that the work has become easier for him because the name of Modi, the prime ministerial candidate, is sold a lot, even though his past is believed to be tainted

 Shah is in charge of the party in Uttar Pradesh with the highest 80 Lok Sabha seats
 ramabai park ke bare main ab tak yahi mana jaataa he ki is park ko mayawati ke alaava or koi puraa nahin bhar saktaa
 That is why the rest of the political parties have avoided to rally in this park
 dilli main party mukhyalay se taiyaari main jute amit shah kehete hai ki modi kii vijay shankhanaad raily ke aage mayawati or mulaayam singh kii ab tak kii sari reliyaan bauni pad jaaengi
 For this, seats in trains going to Lucknow have already been booked and an order has been issued that every booth manager has to raise at least 100 people
 yah raily kaaphi mahatvapurn hogi kyonki isamen modi uttar pradesh kii kisi seat se apni ummidavaari kii ghoshnaa kar sakate hai
 By doing this, he can be considered the real successor of Atal Bihari Vajpayee

 is prachaar ke liye ek collar tun modi aane vaala he, i-commers chanda abhiyaan or bhagidaari funding ke nae swaroop kaa istemaal kiya jayega
 In comparison, Rahul Gandhi's election campaign seems quite traditional and confusing
 unki team ne soshal media kaa istemaal der se shuru kiya or unka online prayaas party ke ghoshnaptr ke liye logon kii raay lene tak hi simit he, jabaki bijepi ne online samarthakon kaa puraa-puraa laabh uthaaya he
 While the dismal performance of UPA-2 has become a sore throat for the Congress, the advertisement of Bharat Nirman on TV and radio looks similar to the bjp's failed India Shining advertisement
 lahar paidaa karne kii aadhunik takneekon kaa istemaal karne main party abhi bahut peeche chal rahi he
 Congress leaders admit, "we still have a lot to do
" ” lekin ve apni rati-ratai baat bhi kah dete he, ''hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii he, jisamen sabakaa vikaas jaruri he
 We know we will win because secularism is in India's thinking
 ”kuch bhi ho, vichaar or takanic ke bal par narendra modi prachaar ke maamle main duusari rajnatik partiyon se kaaphi aage chal rahe hai
 His campaigning is taking us through a round of ratings, meters of truth and perhaps the American presidential election style debate
 lekin bharat kii saamaajik vaastaviktaaon or iske jatil jati samikarnon ko dekhte hue koi bhi anumaan lagaana kathin he
 But the day the voter visits the voting booth to arrive at the EVM to decide the future of the country's veterans, and if at that time he is aware of the Namo Mantra, then only this historic and wanton election campaign will see some benefit, otherwise the burning of milk buttermilk Will continue to blow

 notebandi or jiesti se raahat or aane vaale saalon ke liye achche vyapaar kii ummid jataai he
 Let us know that trade has been affected by demonetisation and GST
 is saal log diwali main lakshmi puja ke saath-saath apane paramparik bahi-khaaton kii bhi puja kar rahe hai
 Actually, in Gujarat it is a tradition that no matter how big the businessman is, he does not stop worshiping his books
 yahi vajah he ki bahi-khaaton kii puja unke vyapaar par maa lakshmi or saraswati kii krupa hameshaa rahati he
 Due to demonetisation and GST, it is believed that business of traders is stagnant
 vyapaaree bhi chaahate hai ki is saal diwali ke baad se shuru hone vaala gujaratiyon ko nayaa saal unke vyapaar or rojgaar ke liye behtareen sabit ho
 These days, where laptops and computers have taken over the books of accounts
 yahi vajah he ki bahi-khaaton ke saath saath laptop ore computor kii bhi puja karte hai
 The traders are confident that the worship of the books will promote their business
 diwali ke din bahi-khaaton kii puja kisi bhi tareeke se ho, computor, laptop ho yaa phir vahi paramparik tareeke vaale bahi-khaaton kii kitaaben, lekin puja kii bhaavana aaj bhi nahin badali he
 When India starts their campaign against the deemed weak Afghanistan in the ICC World T20 Championship cricket tournament here, their goal will be to come up with the right best combination so that they can get into rhythm before the upcoming tough matches
 bharat agar badhuvaar ko afghanistan ko haraa detaa he to 2007 ke champion kaa england ke khilaaf 23 sitambar ko apane duusare or antim mukaable se pehle hi super aath main jagah bananaa lagbhag tay ho jayega
 In just one match between these two teams so far, India had registered an easy seven-wicket win over Afghanistan in the West Indies in the last World T20 tournament
 tippaniyan The real battle of supremacy will begin with the match against England, but a good start against Afghanistan will definitely help Team India to get the rhythm and the team management will be able to know how effective their best combination is
 antim overon main gendbaaji bharat ke liye chintaa kaa sabab rahi he or bharat ke saamne yah mushkil faisla he ki vah paanch visheshgy gendbaajon ke saath utarataa he yaa atirikt ballebaaj ko tavajjo detaa he
 If India defeats Afghanistan on Badhuwar, then the 2007 champions will be almost guaranteed to make it to the Super Eight before their second and final match against England on 23 September

 dilli police ne jab rajdhani ke apollo aspataal main kidney ke international racket kaa pardaafaash kiya to log hairaan rah gaye
 No one believed that this business was flourishing in the country's famous Apollo Hospital
 darasal is racket ke taar desh ke alag-alag rajyon ke saath-saath ilaaj ke liye hindustan aane vaale videshiyon se bhi jude hue the
 When the police arrested Rajkummar Rao, one of the kingpin of this racket, but many secrets are still buried in his chest
 koun he tii rajkumaar ravadilli police ne apollo aspataal kekidney racketke ek sargana tii rajkumaar ko kalakatta se giraftaar kiya tha
 Rajkumar has a long history in the kidney racket case
 mul rup se vah pashchim bengal kaa rahane vaala he
 But he started the business of buying and selling kidneys in collaboration with a doctor in Chennai
 shuruyaat main rajkumaar is gang kaa mahaj ek chota sa khilaadi tha
 Who used to prepare people from West Bengal to donate kidneys and also took the responsibility of getting their fake documents made
 rajkumaar ko is dhandhe main laane vaala shaks chennai kaa ek doctor hi tha
 The prince used to arrange kidney sellers for this doctor and in return he got 3 to 4 lakhs
 colombo main karaate the kidney transplantkuch saal pehle rajkumaar ke sahyogi doctor ko chennai police ne giraftaar kar liya tha or uskaa license bhi radd kar diya gaya tha
 But coming out of jail on bail, the doctor, together with Rajkumar, started a kidney racket again
 usne is kaam main kai doctoron ko bhi apane saath mila liya
 Rajkumar Donor used to do the Orange and the fellow doctors used to do all the tests of the kidney donor and then took the operation of Doctor Donor and the receiver to Colombo
 naam badalata rahata tha rajkumarchennai police se bachane ke liye rajkumaar dilli aa gaya
 And here too he started this business
 alag-alag shaharon main vahdonorsor resevers se alag alag naam se miltaa tha
 For this he also used to create his fake Facebook account
 rajkumaar ke alawa isane apane kai naam rakhe hue the
 Raju in UP, Rajkumar in Bengal and in some places he called his name Raj Sangam
 dilli police ne use kalakatta se giraftaar kiya
 He was hidden there for a long time
 court main pesh karke dilli police ne rajkumaar transit remand lee thi
 Network is spread abroad
 Famous celebrities often arrive at the Apollo Hospital for their treatment
 is aspataal ko tamaam suvidhaon se las mana jaataa he
 But would you believe that a huge kidney racket had been working for six months in this hospital, right in front of Sarita Vihar police station and DCP office of South East district? a kidney racket whose wires were not only spread across the country but also abroad
 or jisane ab tak dhandhebaazi main lakhon nahin, balki karodon rupye ke vaare-nyaare kar die?kidney racket kaa adda apollo aspataalaye baaten ajeeb lagati hai, lekin ab dilli police ne jo khulaasa kiya he, usase saafe ho gaya he ki haa, ye racketariyon ne is aspataal ko apana adda bana liya tha
 The racket was first discovered by the Delhi Police when a couple arrived at the Sarita Vihar police station in front of the hospital complaining of a quarrel
 darasal, donon kidney ke bandarbaant ke dhandhe ke mohare the or donon ke bich kidney kii kharid-farokht kii rakam ko lekar hi ladaai ho gai thi
 This was how the racket was revealed when the police tried to settle the dispute between the two, a new story of kidney racket came out
 iske baad police ne ek-ek is racket ke paanch dhandhebaazon kaa giraftaar kar liya
 Aseem Sikdar, Satya Prakash aka Ashu, Devashish Mallik, Aditya and Shailesh Saxena
 police kii maane to is racket kaa ek mastermind rajkumaar raav hi he
 Which is being arrested and questioned
 police ab is racket ke baaki dhandhebaazon kaa peechha karti hui kolkata, chennai or coimbatore jaisi kai jagahon par chhapemari kar rahi he
 This kidney racket used to work like this, the share of every businessman in this racket was divided
 kuch log shikaar yani donor kii talash karte the, jabaki kuch resiver kii
 Fake papers were then made to show the victim and donor relatives
 aspataal ke mulaazim is kaam main unki madad karte the
 The donor and receiver were then hospitalized
 or 10-15 dinon main deal puri ho jaati thi
 The amount of money in the racket is a shocking thing in itself
 ye racket kidani ke liye zaruuratmand se 20 se 25 lakh vasuulata tha
 In this, middlemen used to get 1-1 lakh rupees
 jabaki donor ko sirf 3 se 4 lakh
 This is why businessmen seek donors and receivers from place to place, get fake papers prepared and then recover lakhs of rupees
 khaas baat ye he ki videshi zaruuratmand ko kidney bechney ke liye hindustani ke mukaable kai guna zyaada rakam milti he
 Big doctors are also involved! In this case the question is, where did the rest of the fat money go? or yahi vajah he ki ab police ko lag rahaa he ki abhi is maamle main kai or khulaase ho sakate hai
 It is possible that a doctor or a big man is also involved in the business
 dilli police ke joint seepi arapy upaadhyaay kaa kahana he ki police abhi jaanch main kisi ko clin chit nahin de rahi he
 If necessary, the doctors of the hospital will also be questioned
 police kii maane to is racket ke taar sirf dilli or aas-paas hi nahin balki puure desh or yahaan tak ki videshon main bhi faile hue hai
 Where do millions of rupees go? The monkey money of the money in the kidney racket flourishing in the country's famous Apollo hospital has confused the police
 darasal, ab tak kii chaanbin main ye baat to saafe he ki ek kidney kii kharid-farokht kul 20 se 25 lakh rupye main hoti he
 But a huge amount of this purchase and sale used to disappear mysteriously
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki is rakam kaa chota hissaa donor or midileman ko miltaa tha
 While the largest portion of the huge amount to be recovered from the receiver goes to the end, at the moment no one knows
 or bas isi sawaal ne police ko is dhandhe kii badi machhliyon kaa pataa lagane ke liye majaboor kar diya he
 This is the reason that now the police has also handed over a long list of questions to the Apollo Hospital Management
 haalanki aspataal prabandhan is maamle par camere par to kuch nahin bolnaa chahta
 But he has given his statement
 apollo aspataal kii safayeeis puure maamle main apollo aspataal ne ek adhikarik bayaan jari karte hue kaha "police ne hamase ek din pehle ek kidney racket ko lekar mulaakaat kii
 We cooperated with the police
 or police ne jo jaankaree hamase maangi wo hamane unhen muhaiyaa karai
 Whatever kidney transplant we have here is done with all the necessary documents
 ham kanoonee prakiya ke tahat kaam karte hai, hame is ghatana kii jaankaree nahin thi
 The two pss caught are not Apollo's staff, but the doctors' pss
 ham dilli police se is maamle main kadi karrwai chaahate hai
 "in fact, two of those arrested so far in this connection are those who work as PS of doctors in Apollo
 or inhen ke zarie ab tak apollo main kidney churaane or use aage bechney kaa kaam chal rahaa tha
 And this was when very stringent government laws exist regarding organ donation
 pichley saal bhi bechi gayi thi kai kidneepuchhatacha main is racket ke aropiyon ne bataaya he ki ye coimbatore main bhi 2015 main kareeb 12 se 15 kidney nikalava chuke he
 Rajkumar Rao is also a mastermind of this business
 police ne usegiraftarkar liya he
 In this case there are also three women donors, who have sold their kidneys with money
 police ne ab tak is racket se kidney transplant ke liye zaruri kaagazat, farji voter ai card, photograph, medical report, electranik gagetts or qareeb do lakh rupye baraamad kiye hai
 At present, the raids are going on not only in Delhi, but also in many other cities of the country including Kolkata, Chennai
 police ke radar par hai doctordilli police ko joint seepi arapy upaadhyaay kaa kahana he ki police kii timen kolkata or chennai ke alaava dilli ke kai ilaakon main chhapemari kar rahi hai
 The difficulty of Apollo Hospital may increase in the coming days as some more staff members and doctors of the hospital are on the police radar
 kya kahata he kaanuunhuman argon transplant act 1994 ke mutabik sirf khun ke rishte vaale log hi apni argon donnet kar sakate hai
 Transplant process can be done only in presence of committee and monitoring of doctors
 sirf mata, pita, bhai, bahan or dada, daadi hi ek duusare ko kidney donnet kar sakate hai
 There is an assessment committee in every hospital for kidney donation
 kidney transplat prakiya ke dauraan video graphy karnaa behad jaruri hota he

 Place, Krishna birth place temple of Mathura
 samay dopaher ke 11:30 baje
 Here and there, a crowd of dispersed devotees and tourists suddenly start climbing the steps towards the main temple
 das minute baad aarti jo shuru honi he
 a large crowd of devotees is waiting to see him
 is bheed main videsh se aae paryatakon se lekar sthaneey nivasee or sukun kii talash main pahunche log bhi hai
 Vaibhav, a 28-year-old youth from Delhi, is also among them
 maathe par tilak lagaae or dhoti-kurta pahane vaibhav gudgaanv kii ity company main manager hai
 They often travel to Mathura by taking time
 iske peeche kii vajah? kaam kii bhaag-daud
 Work-from-home and day-to-day fights on smartphones surrounded them
 weekend bhi kaam karte gujarata
 i could not get long leave, so for peace i thought of going to a place near Delhi
 net par search karte hue dhyaan mathura-vrundavan package kii ore gaya or silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 In his words, "it was nice to come to Braj
" aadhyatmikta or aadhuniktaa kaa sangam dekhne ko mila
 Vaibhav is not alone in thinking so
 yahi vajah he ki braj bhoomi (mathura, vrundavan, govardhan, barsaanaa, nandagaanv or krishna se sambandhit duusare sthal) aane vaale paryatakon kii sankhya main salanaa 3-5 fisadi kaa ijapha ho rahaa he
 Tourism Officer of Uttar Pradesh Tourism Department d
 ke
 Sharma says, "1
5 crore tourists visit Braj Bhumi annually
 ''kanha kii braj bhumihari-bhari chata se bharpoor mathura nagari dharmik paryaton ke alaava aadhyatmikta or sukun ke kuch lamhe gujaarne ke lihaaj se umdaa jagah he
 This city of Kanha is located 150 kilometers from Delhi
 yahaan krishna se jude sthalon kii koi kami nahin he lekin shri krishna janmasthan vaala mandir khaas aakarshan he
 a grand event is held here on the occasion of Janmashtami
 shrikrishna janmasthan seva santhaan ke sachiv kapil sharma bataate hai, ''yahaan aane vaale logon kii sankhya har saal bad rahi he
 Some come for tourism and some with devotion
 uddeshy chaahe jo ho lekin ve banke bihari ke mohak rup ke diwane hokar hi lautate hai
 "kapil believes that the number of youth who have come here has increased
 mathura ke saath-saath govardhan or vrundavan bhi paryatakon main kaaphi lokapriy hai
 Every year, on Ashada Purnima, people gather for the circumambulation of Govardhan Parvat
 family trip ke liye bhi mathura-vrundavan sarkal ko ekadam feet mana jaataa he
 D
 ke
 Sharma says, "being a religious city, the family holiday here is quite popular
" yahaan ashramon main bane thri star guest house main 800-1,000 ru
 i get a room
 khaanaa bhi yahaan ghar jaisaa rahata he, jo aadhuniktaa ke rang main range logon ko kaaphi acha lagata he
 "the main reason for increasing tourist movement in this Dharmagri of Uttar Pradesh can be attributed to the increasing trend of people leaving their homes
" vaibhav kehete hai, ''routine life se ham log thak jate hai
 Various types of pressure and daily traffic and disaster in the office
 aise main kuch relif to chahie hi
 "it is not that tourists come here only from India, but also the flock of foreign tourists can be seen here
 koi barasaane kii holi ke liye yahaan aata he to koi janmashtami ke aayojan main shaamil hone ke liye
 There are many people who do not forget the streets of Braj in the love of Krishna
 aise hi prempash main australia kii gres fansi hai
 She comes to Mathura continuously for the last three years
 ab to unhone tuuti-phooti hindi bhi sikh lee he, khadi boli ke lahaze vaali

 There are two types of tourists coming to the main land of Braj bhumi-thikanebraj
 ek ve jo vishuddh dharmik paryaton yaa sirf ghoomane ke liye aate hai duusare jo agra jate samay mathura-vrundavan ko apane plan main shaamil kar lete hai
 Agra is at a distance of 50 km from here, so a cult becomes two hides
 di
 K
 sharma bataate hai, ''har kisi kii apni planning hoti he
 For example, many people come to visit the kokilavan-giriraj parikrama and the Banke Bihari temple
 kuch logon kaa or bada program hota he
 "mathura has Sri Krishna Janmasthana Temple, Dwarkadhish Temple and Vishram Ghat, while Vrindavan has the ancient Banke Bihari Temple of Lord Krishna, Radharaman Temple, Keshi Ghat and Radha Govind Temple
 inke alaava govardhan parvat, radhakund or kusum sarovar bhi mashîr hai
 Not only this, with the changing times, the number of temples here has increased rapidly
 Outside the ISKCON temple in Vrindavan, the influx of foreign tourists can always be seen in Indian costumes, while the lovers of entertainment like Vrindavan's Prem Mandir and Mother Vaishno Devi Temples have also started going
 desh-duniya se sailaani saal bhar yahaan aate hai
 There is a lot of flock here on the weekend
 sadak se behtareen connactivity, dheron railgadibhan or agra hawaii adde se kareebi mathura-vrundavan ko sailaaniyon ke liye dream destination main tabdeel kar detii he
 That's why people come here whenever they want to

 'while there has been a significant change in perception from the new government, we will see complete improvement only in 2016-17
 ' The era of Bollywood is considered the Golden Era of the 70s
 is dauraan kii filmein, gane or actors kii style logon ke bich kaaphi popular hui thi
 It was only in the 70s that megastar Amitabh Bachchan came to be known as Angry Young Man
 saal 1978 ko amitabh kii film don relies hui thi
 The film rocked the box office
 film ke gane logon ke bich khub popular hue the
 On the completion of 41 years of the film, Amitabh Bachchan shared a cryptic tale about the title of the movie
 big bi ne likhaa, "don' ek aisa naam tha, jise market main kisi kii manjuuri nahin mili thi
 They never understood what it meant and they never felt that a name like 'don' was right for the title of a Hindi film
 agar sach kaha jaae to kai logon ke liye yah ek hasyaprad sheershak tha
 "he also said that the title of the film sounded like an undergarment brand
 amitabh ne likhaa, "us vakt ek mashhoor brands ke baniyaan kaa naam bhi 'don' tha
 When people used to name that vest company in the market, it sounded exactly like the title of the film 'don' and in such a way, giving a title to a film which is expressing an undergarment, it was full of fear

 After Deepika Kumari and Ronjan Singh Sodhi, Indian boxing poster boy Vijender Singh also got frustrated
 somvaar raat ko hue quarterfinal mukaable main uzbekistan ke boxr abos ateov ke haathon mili karaari shikast se kai armaan dhul gaye
 There was a tremendous atmosphere before Vijender's match at Axel Arena at 10 pm on Monday night
 is baat kaa andaja isse bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki british ladkiyaan bhi 'viju
 
 
 Viju
 
 She was cheering Vijender Singh by shouting
 lekin haath lagi niraashaa
 Vijender could not perform which would have earned him a semi-final ticket
 mukaable se pehle anayas hi 2010 asian games ke final wo tasviren yaad aa rahi thim jisamen vijender singh ne abos ateov ko haraaya tha
 But expectations fizzled out as bubbles from a soda bottle
 stadium main maujuud darshak protsaahit karte rahe lekin vijender kii pratidwandi ke saamne ek na chali
 Everyone is aware that Vijender is not like other middleweight boxers who use a strategy of throwing punches at the opposition
 vijender rakshaatmak style kii boxing karte hai or bich-bich main vipakshiyon par sateek panch jadkar point batorte hai
 Probably, Etiov had read this style of Vijender Singh completely
 jo puure match ke dauraan dikhaa
 Eventually Vijender could not live up to those expectations
 puure mukaable ke dauraan kabhi bhi vijender champinay kii tarah nahin khele
 And they lost 17–13
 match ke baad vijender singh media se mukhaatib tak nahin hue
 For this reason, Boxing Federation Secretary Brig Muralitharan Raja had to undergo a media briefing
 raja ne kaha ki vijender singh ateov se behatar mukkebaaz hai par aaj unka din nahin tha
 Sadly, Raja did not notice that the middleweight match consists of 3 rounds which ended in just 9 minutes
 par somvaar raat ko hue mukaable main ek pal ke liye bhi vijender champion kii tarah khele

 Input: PTI pichhali chauthai sadi main hindustani sangeet nae badlaavon ke saath nae rup main saamne aayaa he
 The older generation gave new people a chance to come forward
 nae daur ke sangeetkaaron ne nae prayog ke saath sangeet kii nai paudh sajaa-sanvaar kar pesh kii
 However, the debate continues whether today's notes are better or not
 par jo baat dil ko ajij lag rahi he vah yah he ki ye sangeetkaar bhavishya ko dekh rahe hai or usee ke anusaar apane sur-sangeet-style ko sanvaar rahe hai, saajon ko nayaa andaaj de rahe hai, technology or media kaa behtareen istemaal kar rahe hai
 Gharana Shaileen could not understand the audience, nor the critics
 jashn kaa aagaaj karte hue bataaya gaya ki shaam ke yuva kalakaar agra gharaane se hai
 He came to the stage, took alaap in the style of Agra gharana, the lyrics were in Gwalior style and the song was completed by singing in the hymns of Amonkar, a teenager from Jaipur gharana
 aaj shastreey sangeet kii vibhinn vidhaon ko aisi hi bahurangi sur-lahari main pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 Classical music has been nurtured in the guru-shishya tradition
 idhar guru ne sargam kii taan lee or udhar shishy ne doharaaya
 The recitation of music was started in a similar manner and completed as such
 shishy guru ke saath rahakar apana kharchaa khud uthaakar sangeet siikhaa karte
 It was not possible to learn from anyone outside the household, nor was it the practice of school or book or professional music teacher
 guru ne jis pratibha ko chunaa, vahi sangeet sikh saktaa tha yaa phir unke sage-sambandhi
 Nevertheless, in the last 25 years, the role of gharanas in music education seems to be marginalized and in view of the current situation, it seems that it will go further backward
 isaki vajah saamaajik bhi ho sakati he yaa aitihaasik or aarthik bhi
 In the olden days, the maharatis of music used to get work in their own state
 samay bitne ke saath ye fankaar sthaneey shaskaon ke aamod-pramod ke liye unke darbariyon main shaamil kiye jane lage
 But as a result, they kept cutting off from the common people
 unke paas suron ke hunar ke alaava kuch tha hi nahin
 Therefore, he had put all his energy into preparing his riaz and nuances
 vah sangeet kaa shandaar yug tha
 a new texture has begun to emerge in the traditional character and style of gharana
 samay ishaara kar rahaa he ki isamen abhi or rang bhare jaaenge kyonki gharaana style kii ekares aawaaj or taan ke fan ko jindagi bhar maanjte rahane or isaki simaaon ke andar hi apane khaas andaaj ko taiyaar karne kii baaten aaj bemaani hoti ja rahi hai
 New development of technology is opening new doors for music
 puraane jamaane main microphone yaa laudspikar to hote nahin the, isliye kalakaaron ko apane sur ko khaas tareeke se riyaj main baandhna hota tha, jisase kaarykram pesh karte samay zyada se zyada logon tak unki aawaaj pahunch sake
