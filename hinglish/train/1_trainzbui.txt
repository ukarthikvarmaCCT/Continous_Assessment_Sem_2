 lekin desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency ke mutabik abhi tak purv rail mantri kii sidhi bhoomika ke koi sidhe saboot nahin he
 On the other hand, Pawan Bansal is constantly getting caught in the investigation with the calls recorded by the CBI for the conversation of the accused
 bansal ke bhaanje vijay singla ke mahesh kumaar ke saath baatcheet ke tepe main kai gambhir baaten darj hai
 During the talks, Vijay Singla is negotiating a bribe with Mahesh Kumar
 jaankaree ke mutabik vijay singla ne mahesh kumaar se saaf taur par kaha ki 10 karod kii rakam se neeche par rail mantri naaraaz ho jaaenge
 According to sources, out of the call records of the accused with the CBI, half a dozen of them are constantly negotiating bribes during negotiations
 mahesh kumaar or manjunath is baat par jor de rahe hai ki ye rishwat kuch kam honi chahie, lekin singla ek rupaya bhi kam karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Singla is even mentioning the names of the officials attending the meetings to give confidence to Mahesh Kumar in his conversation
 ab sibiai ke saamne yah sawaal baar-baar khadaa ho rahaa he ki kya vijay singla sirf apni baat par jor dene ke liye pawan bansal kaa naam le rahaa he yaa phir bansal se uski baat ho chuki thi? sibiai kol record ko filon se mila rahi he or tay karne kii koshish kar rahi he ki bansal ko is maamle main kitna maaloom he
 However, the CBI is also making claims to collect evidence, saying that Pawan Bansal will be questioned if there is enough evidence

 Uddhav Thackeray also said that Bal Thackeray's condition is stable
 uddhav ke saath aditya thakare bhi matoshri ke baahar aae
 Earlier on Thursday, other senior Sena leaders also said that there are signs of improvement in Bal Thackeray's health

 a medical bulletin has not yet been released on the health of the 86-year-old leader, but a doctor treating him said that Thackeray has so far been kept on oxygen

 However, garbage is sold near the street street
 sarkari daftaron ke galiyare daagdar hai, duusari ore nijee offis complex kii saaf-suthri sidhiruaan mobile par batiyaane kaa pasandida thikaana hai
 Cleanliness campaigns are hailed, but the issue of cleanliness goes beyond the call of volunteering and makes cleanliness a problem like power, education, health, which are unmatched by the stubborn shortage of infrastructure
 shaharon main ab saaf or gandi imaaraten, aspataal or saarvajanik sthal ek saath dikhte hai or yah fark logon kii ichhashakti se nahin balki suvidhaon kii aapurti se aayaa he
 Cleanliness is the last in the government's responsibilities, so public places with government management are smelly, while sanitation in privately managed public places is a natural part of daily functioning
 kya khub hota ki aam logon ko jhaadu uthaane ke protsaahan ke saath, karmchaariyon kii kami, kachra prabandhan kii chunautiyon, buniyadi dhaanche ke abhaav or sansadhano ke intjaam kii charchaa bhi shuru hoti, jiske bina safai kaa sirf dikhaava hi ho saktaa he
 It is important to remember the story of Surat because the hollow symbolism of the cleanliness campaign rings out after knowing it
 1994 main plig failane ke baad gujarat ke surat shahar kaa puraa prashasan hi nae sire se gadha gaya tha
 Deployment of supervisors by dividing the city into six zones and 52 sanitary districts, new staff for round-the-clock sanitation, construction of large scale facilities, use of private companies in waste management, strict daily monitoring and plague after illegal construction is banned Became the cleanest city in India in 18 months
 97 fisadi kachra vyavasthit dhang se sangrah kiya jane laga
 Why was this Gujarat model not mentioned during the latest cleanliness events? There was a huge investment in changing the 'surat' of Surat, the administration changed its habits and later it was linked to public participation
 sadaken buhaarti chhaviyon kaa daur khatm hote hi gandagi apni jagah mustaid dikhne lagati he, kyonki nagarpalikaon main prati din lagbhag 1
 More than 1
5 million tonnes of waste is released and according to the 12th Five Year Plan, there is no provision of solid waste disposal in India
 2001 kii janaganana ke anusaar, class van or tu shaharon main 80 fisadi sivej kaa treetment nahin hota
 The 2011 census reported that 37 percent of the houses in cities are connected by open drains while 18 percent of the households have water flowing on the road
 barsaati pani sanbhaalane ke liye 80 fisadi sadakon ke saath drenez nahin he
 The Eicher Ahluwalia Committee had assessed that five lakh crore rupees to build sewage, solid waste management and rainwater drains in cities
 kii jarurat he
 Can any volunteering be an option for this huge need for resources? It is important to note that the matter of cleaning the cities has already started, even the brick of sanitation infrastructure has not been laid in the villages
 kachra or gandagi badhati aabaadi kii anivaary buraai he isliye safai aitihaasik taur par yudhstareey chunauti he
 New York in 1894 was so dirty that Theodore Roosevelt, then head of the New York Police Commission (later to become America's 26th president), did not agree to take over the city's cleanliness
 unki salaah par neuyork ke meyar wiliam strang ne purv karnal or sena main ghudsawaari daston ke visheshgy jorge venksharag ko city clining department kaa jimmaa saunpa
 Colonel Waring's war against the dirt was full of controversies, various kinds of rigor and heavy expenditure
 lekin 1898 main jab ve cuba main sanitessan kaa jimmaa lene ke liye ravaanaa hue tab tak neuyork kaa cheharaa badal chukaa tha
 Experiences in various cities of the world show that sanitation, sewage and waste management are a daily war that takes huge resources and people
 isamen koi motaa phayda nahin hota isliye nijee nivesh bhi simit rahata he
 Administration of local bodies is the axis of daily cleanliness but the municipal bodies in India are the most impoverished and poor part of the administrative structure
 edibi ke teen saal puraane adhyayan ke mutabik, nagar nikaayon kaa rajasav jidipi kii tulana main sirf 0
 54 percent
 desh ke kul kar sangrah main inkaa hissaa dashakon se 1
 Is stable at 7 per cent
 1992 main 74wein samvidhan sanshodhan ke baavjood nagar nikaayon ko na adhikaar mili or na hi rajasav strot
 Thus, the maintenance of the municipal bodies of the country was Rs 22,649 crore against the requirement
 kam kharch karte hai
 To improve their financial health, cleanliness campaigns will be seen only on TV
 achraj nahin ki surat nagarpalika aaj bhi apni website ke jariye adhikariyon ke field work, safai or kachra sangrah kaa masik byoraa, shikaayat nivaaran kii jaankaree detii he
 Jan Jagriti Abhiyan is the last in preference because Shramdaan can make Gandhi platform a expressway
 bharat main lambey or safal abhiyaanon main sirf polio unmoolan najar aata he
 However, it took 15 years to cure this disease by delivering the medicine to children once or twice a year
 rojaanaa safai kii chunauti isaki tulana main bahut badi or mahangi he
 Therefore, the motives of cleanliness are as stubborn as questions like head, but inadequate facilities, scarcity of resources, poor municipal bodies, garbage cannot be removed by stealing

 About 20,000 in a year, 50 every day, two children in every hour — ranging in age from seven months to 17 — were trampled, raped and put to death and behind the bloodshed, torture
 And that blind insanity of extreme betrayal: the tongue lustful sexuality of adult people for the innocent

 phir chaahe wo maharashtra ho, haryana ho, jharkhand, jammu kashmir ho yaa phir assam hi kyon na ho
 In such a situation, the party has the highest expectations from UP
 survey main sabase badi party banakar ubhari bijepido maheene pehle heindia tudegrup ke liye 'exis-maai-india' ne upi main jo survey kiya tha uske mutabik bhi bijepi ko 403 sadasyeey vidhansabha main 170 se 183 siton par vijay mil rahi thi
 According to this opinion poll, Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party was going to be at number two with 115-124 seats and SP was at number three with 94 to 103 seats
 congress ko mahaj 8 se 12 siton par hi jeet milti dikhaai de rahi thi
 According to this opinion poll, behind this growth of BJP, it has the support of other backward castes in the state
 kyonki rajya kii 44 fisadi gaiyr yadav obisi kaa kahana tha ki wo camel par batan dabaaenge
 Forward castes (upper castes) in Uttar Pradesh also appeared to stand with the BJP as 61 per cent of them had given their first choice to Kamal
 akhilesh-shivpal antarkalah kaa phayda bijepi kogauratlab he ki ye survey us vakt karaayaa gaya tha jab samaajawaadee party ke andar kii kalah khulkar saamne nahin ai thi or na hi tab is baat kaa andeshaa tha ki sapa tikat bantwaare ko lekar is tarah do faad ho jaaegi
 But in November, when it was revealed that Akhilesh Yadav was thinking of contesting elections by forming a separate party, in a quick survey, when people were asked who would benefit from this internal riot of SP, 39% people said that this BJP will be benefited while exactly 10% less i
e
 29% people said that BSP will get its benefit
 saaf he ki sapa main hone vaale kisi bhi sambhavit bantwaare kaa nuksaan khud sapa or mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko hone vaala he jabaki phaayde main bijepi rah sakati he
 The BJP is also in the lead, in a big screwup, the voters are liking the BJP but they may have to suffer the cost of contesting elections without leadership
 india today ke jis survey main votaron ne bijepi ko apni pehali pasand bataaya tha usee survey main mayawati mukhyamantri ke taur par unki pehali pasand thim
 Maya got 31 per cent of the votes in this case while Akhilesh Yadav was second
 unhen 27 fisadi logon ne siem ke taur par pasand bataaya
 The country's home minister and former UP chief minister wanted to see Rajnath Singh become the chief minister of 18 percent of voters
 jaahir he bijepi ko upi main ek karishmai chehre kii darkaar he
 Looking at some of the recent assembly elections, the public has expressed more confidence in the party whose CM candidate is already announced
 dilli main kuch hi maheene ke bheetar hue do chunaavon main bijepi kaa 28 se ghatakar mahaj teen siton tak simat jane kii badi vajah ye bhi bataai gai ki bijepi ne pehla chunaav doctor harshavardhan ke netritv main ladaa jabaki duusare chunaav main usne antim kshanon main kiran bedi ko parachute candidate banaaya
 In fact, the traditional voters of SP are considered Yadavs and Muslims
 agar espi do faad hoti he to muslim vot chhitakkar mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party ko mil sakate hai jabaki sapa se niraash yadav vot loksabhaa chunaav kii tarah vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bijepi par bharosa jataa saktaa he
 If this happens, the staircases of Dalit and Muslim alliances can give Mayawati power as in 2007 and the BJP can continue to shake hands

 dilli ke mukhyamantri ke taur par unhone vidhansabha main janalokapal pesh karne kii koshish kii lekin sadan ne unhen isaki ijaajat nahin di or bhrashtachar ko khatm karne ke liye “1,000 baar mukhyamantri kii kursi daanv par lagane ko taiyaar” or yahaan tak ki “jaan dene ke liye bhi taiyaar” kejariwal ne apni 49 dinon puraani sarkaar shahid kar di
 However, earlier in the House, the Kejriwal government passed a proposal to subsidize the power companies with the help of Congress
 kejariwal kii shahadat kii siyasat se paaramparik raajnneeti karne vaali partiyon ke liye nai musiibat paidaa ho sakati he
 Kejriwal may call himself anarchist but things are very clear in his mind
 dilli ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bemisaal kamyaabi ke teen maheene pehle unhone ek intervyuu main aap kii bhavi yojanaon ke bare main apane sapane kii charchaa kii thi
 He told the online portal indiaops
com, "if we come to power in Delhi, it will create a new atmosphere of great hope across the country
 tab ham agle do maheene tak logon kii ummiido main or ufaan paidaa karenge
 In that case, the next Lok Sabha election will not be normal, it will be a different type of election
 ” or kejariwal apana sapana puraa karne ke raste par chal pade hai
 Kejriwal's strategy is riding politics and anti-leader sentiments
 Kejriwal is now in politics himself but he is trying to show himself like that lotus which has blossomed into mud
 loksabhaa main 13 farvari ko telugana ke mudde par jo abhootpurv hangaamaa hua vah aap ke netaa ke liye kisi ishwariya vardaan se kam nahin rahaa
 In his speech on 14 February in Delhi Legislative Assembly, Kejriwal condemned the violence in Parliament and the events in the Assembly
 kejariwal jaanate hai ki desh ke log netaaon ke is aacharan se naaraaz hai
 They want to ride this public sentiment
 dilli main bahumat nahin hone ke baavjood utsahit aap ne sarkaar to bana lee, lekin janata kii ummiido ke boj or system ke pech main sarkaar aisi uljhi kii uski jabardast aalochana bhi hone lagi
 The ministers of the Kejriwal government started getting into controversies from day one
 kejariwal ne isi vajah se khud loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladgaye kaa elaan bhi kar diya tha, lekin party kaa ek dhada chahta tha ki kejariwal ke bina loksabhaa chunaav main jane se utani safalataa nahin mil paaegi
 aap's strategy was to force the Congress to withdraw its support while the Congress was avoiding doing so and the Congress also tried to surround AAP by adopting a dual strategy in the Assembly
 vaise, aap ne bhi apni sthiti majboot karne ke liye vakt kaa istemaal kiya
 aap's nearly one-and-a-half month project in Delhi is a dramatic leap forward from that educated, upper middle class, with the support of which this party came to power
 usne ab apni nazren ek behad mahatvakankshi varg par tikaa di hai jo garibi rekha ke upar aa gaya he or apana bhavishya sanvaarane kii aakanksha rakhata he
 a 2010 survey by the National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) pointed to a class below the middle class
 yah varg aage badaae kii aakanksha rakhata he or isaki aamadani salanaa 90,000 ru
 Two lakh rupees
 ke bich he
 The survey revealed that the scope of this class has increased to about one-third of the total population in the last decade
 chunaav purv aap kii website par post kiye gaye ek intervyuu main party ke ranneetikaar yogendra yadav ne kaha, “aise saboot hai ki hamaari takat madhya main zyada he lekin yah madhya vah nahin he jiskaa matlab madhyavarg se lagaaya jaataa he kyonki yahaan madhyavarg kaa arth sattarudh varg se liya jaataa he
 “you feel that its base base is weak in the upper 10% of the society (on the scale of income) and the lower 20% while the middle 70% is strong
 party ne deshbhar main 350 loksabhaa siton par chunaav ladgaye kii apni manshaa jaahir kii to use pichley dedh maheene main sambhavit ummidavaaron ke kareeb 9,000 aavedan praapt hue
 Anand Kumar, a member of the party's national executive, says, "it has set people's hopes high
 ” unke jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke awaas par ek ritair faujee afasar ek loksabhaa seat ke liye apana aavedan lekar milane aae the
 He says, "one day a Dalit lawyer met us and said that he wanted to contest elections against Mulayam Singh Yadav, the head of the Samajwadi Party
 ye log madhyavarg ke nahin hai
 What started in Delhi has started to be realized across the country
 ” is saal janvari main kiye gaye india today-si voter surveykshan se pataa chalata he ki 38 fisadi log kejariwal ko pradhanmantri ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate hai, jo bhartiya jaanata party (bijepi) ke narendra modi ke baad doosraa number he
 But keeping in mind the new ambitious class, you would like to create a wave of hope across the country and under this special scheme all the party's moves are going on in Delhi
 haalanki baahar se dekhne vaale ko yah ranneeti utani samaj nahin aati, jitani party ke kartadharta ise bheetar se samajhate hai
 The anti-corruption Campaign, Lokpal and Civil Inspector Jan Lokpal Bill talks about investigations and prosecutions of corruption cases within the deadline
 kejariwal ne pehle hi dhamkee de di thi ki yah vidheyak paas nahin hua to ve istipha de denge
 Since Delhi is a Union Territory, it needs the approval of the Central Government to pass every Bill, but Kejriwal flatly refused to send the Bill to the Central Government for 'inspection'
 dilli ke uparajyapal ne ise sadan pesh karne kii ijaajat nahin di
 Since late January, Kejriwal has been telling the people of Delhi on the radio not to refuse to bribe government officials, but instead take them in bribe or talk and record it on their mobile phones and send it to the party's anti-corruption helpline Give kejariwal kii aawaaj radio par goonjati thi, “ab har naagarik police inspector kii tarah ban jayega
 Then, on February 11, he ordered an FIR against Union Petroleum Minister Veerappa Moily and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani for illegally raising the price of natural gas
 bhrashtachar virdohi muhim aap kaa sabase purana or sabase mufeed chunavi naaraa he isliye use lagata he ki iskaa use nae mahatvakankshi varg main baari laabh milegaa, jo adhikariyon kii mutthi garam karte-karte thak gaya he
 In India's today-sea Voters poll, 40 percent of middle class people today consider corruption as the biggest problem in the country
 kejariwal kii muhim fouran hit ho gai
 This Delhi government helpline became the most popular among shopkeepers and street vendors who are most upset with the Delhi Police soldiers
 ambani ke khilaaf exiar bhi masterstroke sabit hua
 Says a party leader, "many people believe that industrial houses are looting the country and Kejriwal is the first to take on them
 ”sadak kii raajnneeti, sansad par nigahendharane par baitha andolankaaree mukhyamantridilli ke kanoon mantri somnath bharti ne apane samarthakon ke saath 18 janvari ko khidki ekstansion main kathith taur par nashili dawaaon or veshyavriti ke racket ke khilaaf aadhi raat ko ek ghar main red daali thi
 There the Delhi Police refused to kill Raid without a warrant, so there was an argument with the Law Minister
 iske fouran baad kejariwal ne elaan kar diya ki dilli police ko centre ke badale dilli sarkaar ke adheen laayaa jaae varanaa ve 10 din kaa dharna denge
 Life in Central Delhi was disturbed by the Chief Minister's sit-in with his entire cabinet
 haalanki dedh din baad grih mantralay ke saath samjhauta hua or dharna tutaa
 Two policemen who argued with Bharti were sent on leave
 party ke bhitari logon kaa maananaa he ki yah iklauta kadam shaayad jaldbaaji main or paristhitiyon kii vajah se uthaaya gaya
 Kejriwal got media, a section of the upper middle class and Captain ji to sit on the dharna
 aar
 Party members like Gopinath suffered resentment
 baavjood iske kejariwal yah sandesh dene main kaamyaab hue ki ve sarkaar ke bandhe-bandhaae kaayadon par nahin chalenge or jaruri hone par sadak par utarate rahenge
 In a TV interview on 10 February, he called the dharna a "cultural shock" for some
 unhone yathasthitwaad ko todakar sthapit sansthaaon or mandandon se aage jane kaa sankalp doharaaya jo padhe-likhe abhijatya tabake ko to nahin suhaya par nae madhyavarg main baari josh bhar gaya
 One party member explains, "most people don't mind challenging institutions because they have been victims of them
" sirf apekshaakrit samrudh log hi sansthaaon kii maryaada kii baat karte hai kyonki unhen dar hota he ki unke bikharane se unhen ghaataa hoga
 To the critics of the common man's revolutionary measures, Kejriwal said that sleeping on the road is no laughing joke if the night temperature is 4 degrees
 raat main sadak par sone kii tasviir kaiyon ko kaaphi prerit karti he
 The Nagar Swaraj Bill would have been the most revolutionary reform of the AAP government
 vidheyak main puure shahar main 2,720 mohalla sabhaaon ke haath satta ke vikendrikaran kii baat he
 These mohalla sabhas will do the cleaning of roads, public vaccination, education for all and guarding the heritage
 vidheyak har sabha ko apane kshetra main lok kalyaan ke liye har tarah kaa kharch karne kaa adhikaar detaa he
 The idea of running the administration through Mohalla meetings is the core of Kejriwal's new politics
 aap kii rashtriya kaaryakarini ke ek sadsy kehete hai, “samaaj ko adivasee, anusuchit jati vagairah vibhinn khaanchon main baantne ke badale mohalla sabha logon ko ek karne kaa madhyam banegi
 "the Congress argues that the Residents Welfare Association in the city is doing the work of the Mohalla Sabha, AAP argues that they are limited in scope and largely occupied by the upper middle class
 mohalla sabha main har ilaake main adhikarhin tabake ko pratinidhitiv milegaa
 The AAP government has provided enough issues for the campaign at the national level and now the party has started strengthening it further
 anand kumaar ke mutabik, agle kuch hafte mahatvapurn honge, jab party ummidavaaron kii antim suchi or rashtriya ghoshnaptr jari karegi
 He says, "the list will show that the party is really open to good candidates
" rashtriya yojana taiyaar karne ke liye jo kai cametiyaan banaai gai thim, unamem kai ko saath jod diya gaya he
 For example, in terms of economy and environment, the party is consulting many experts
 philhal to aise hi sanket hai ki party ne chaturaai se apane manapsand matadaata varg ko lubhaa liya he
 It is interesting that both Congress and BJP opposed the 'way' of bringing Janlokpal Bill
 lekin aap ke netaa logon ko bataa rahe hai ki donon partiyaan bhrashtachar ke mudde par ekajute ho gai hai
 Better resignation than fulfilling promises: Trying to be the voice of anti-corruption, but the biggest question is that Kejriwal got almost six months to gain the confidence of the people before the Delhi Assembly elections
 is dauraan ve media kii halchal se dur kisi darvesh kii tarah janata se judye ke kaam main lage rahe
 On the other hand, after forming the government, Kejriwal opened issues one after the other
 dilli ko unhone ek aisa oparation theatre bana diya, jahaan puraane marz kii cheer-faad to kar di gai, lekin taanke kisi ko nahin lagaae gaye
 Everything was scattered
 kejariwal or unki party ne dilli vidhansabha chunaav main ummiido kii sawari kii thi
 Promises were made from lowering the rate of electricity-water to opening 500 schools and making quick court decisions, filling the backlog of reservation, permitting all contract workers, including sweepers
 ye vaade sarkaar par baari pad rahe the or aae din shahar main theka karmchaariyon ke pradarshan ho rahe the
 The government also partly tried to fulfill some promises
 isaki vajah se dilli main party kii lokapriyata kaa graph ghatata ja rahaa tha
 Party leaders feel that a large section of the population is seeing it as a war against Kejriwal against dirty politics
 vaise unhen ehsaas ho gaya tha ki sarkaar agar chalati rahati he to use anti inakambency yaa sarkaar virdohi bhaawanaaon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Therefore, political martyrdom is a better, cheaper and more vote-grabbing step than keeping promises
 agar matadaataaon ne bhi ise kejariwal ke nazariye se hi dekha to bijepi or congress kii pareshaani bad sakati he
 —with Santosh Kumar samaajawaadee party main chachaa-bhattije kii jang main ab maamla party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav tak pahunch gaya he
 On Thursday, a meeting of the Parliamentary Board has been called, in which a decision will be taken in this regard, whereas earlier on Wednesday, Shivpal Yadav held a two and a half hour long meeting with elder brother Mulayam in Delhi
 iske baad shivpal ne kaha ki vah istipha nahin denge
 Shivpal said, 'there is no question of resignation
 main abhi bhi mantri hum or rahoonga
 i will also play the post of UP President
 'bataa den ki mangalvaar ko achaanak uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri or apane bete akhilesh yadav se party pradesh adhyaksh kaa pad lekar mulaayam singh ne ise shivpal singh yadav ko saunp diya
 After this, as CM Akhilesh withdrew several important portfolios from the cabinet minister of UP government Shivpal
 upi sarkaar seshivpal ke istife kii atakalone jor pakad liya he
 However, Shivpal has definitely said that he is not angry
 jabaki lakhanu main akhilesh ne kaha ki kuch faisle liye gaye hai or ise bare main sabko jaankaree he
 Shivpal, who reached Delhi to meet Mulayam, before meeting Mulayam Singh Yadav said that it is the right of the Chief Minister to remove ministers and officers
 unhone kaha ki netaji unhen jo bhi jimmedaari denge use puri takat se nibhaayenge
 He said that he would take the decision to take any of his steps only after meeting Mulayam Singh
 vahiin akhilesh buudhvaar ko mulaayam se milane dilli nahin pahunche
 Mulayam will do the final decision
 Amid this controversy of nephew, Akhilesh said that after the SP Parliamentary Board meeting in Lucknow on Thursday, all kinds of speculation will end
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar se jude kuch faisle unke hai or kuch unke pita or sapa pramukh netaji ke
 Netaji's decision will be the last and it is accepted by all
 padhein: mulaayam kunbe main ghamaasan par shivpal kii 5 badi baaten, jaane kya hai inke minekhilesh ne kaha- parivaar nahin, sarkaar kaa maamlokhilesh ne kaha ki yah parivaar kaa nahin sarkaar kaa maamla he
 Without naming Amar Singh, he said how the party would run with the intervention of outsiders
 vahinshivpal-akhileshke bich chhide ghamaasan par pratikriya dene se bachate hue amar singh ne kaha ki main mulaayamavaadi hum, samaajawaadee nahin
 Apart from this, i will not say anything at the moment

 Apart from this, she also avoided saying anything about the removal of two ministers and a big bureaucrat close to her
 siem ko sarkaar kii chhavi kii chintaraajanneetik vishleshak maanate hai ki asal main yahpuri ladaai image kihai
 Akhilesh as the head of the state has suddenly become very serious about the image of his government

 The Tamil Nadu government announced the release of all seven of Rajiv Gandhi's assassins Santhan, Sriharan alias Murugun, Perarivalan, Nalini, Rarbat Pius, Ravichandran and Jayakumar from the Supreme Court after the hanging of Rajiv Gandhi's three killers to life imprisonment

 Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar's health is poor and he is admitted in Delhi kms
 udhrgoamembijepiki sarkaar ke saamne sankat is baat kaa he ki aakhir rajkaaj sanbhale koun
 Like Parrikar, no leader with experience looks far and wide, and there the government functions have gone into a sluggish mode
 parrikar kii kharaab tabiyat or bijepi netritv main 'vaikum' kaa puraa phayda congress uthaanaa chaahati he, tabhi usne aanan-fanan main rajyapal se milakar floor test kii maang kii he
 a memorandum has also been submitted in this regard
 duusari ore bijepi he jise bhaleebhanti pataa he ki mukhyamantri badalane par vidhaan sadan main floor test hoga or party siyaasi bhavar main funs sakati he
 Therefore, the entire focus of the party is to avoid any crisis of the Deputy CM, due to which the Congress strategy also fails
 dipti siem ko lekar vishwajit rane kaa naam sabase aage chal rahaa he
 At the same time, for the post of Chief Minister, Rajya Sabha member Vinay Tendulkar and Bahujan Samaj leader Shripad Naikka are also coming forward
 sudin dhawalikar ke naam par bavalamedia ke kuch dhade main dipti siem pad ke liye sudin dhawalikar kaa naam bhi aa rahaa he lekin inke naam par purv main bavaal ho chukaa he, isliye inhen pad saunpane kii sambhaavna kaaphi kam dikhti he
 Dhavalikar's case is stuck because he is a senior leader of Maharashtra Gomantak Party (MGP) but his party does not want to merge with the BJP
 jabaki yah maang tej ho gai he ki parrikar sarkaar main emjeepi ke teen vidhayak ab aupchaarik rup se bijepi main mil jaaen taaki bijepi kii sankhya 14 se 17 ho jaae
 This will help BJP in achieving the floor test
 bijepi main emjeepi ke vilay ko emjeepi adhyaksh ne nakaarte hue kaha, ham vilay nahin kar sakate kyonki hamaari party varshon kii mehnat kaa fal he or bhavishya main goa kii raajnneeti kii ummid bhi
 Goa has 12-13 per cent vote bank, so there is no question of meeting with BJP
 dhawalikar kii is baat se saaf he ki ve bijepi main nahin milenge
 And it is also clear that the BJP cannot give him a big post without mixing it, so Philhar seems to be breaking the name of Dhavalikar
 mukhyamantri pad ke liye pramod saavant kaa bhi naam aage aa rahaa he, jo vidhansabha ke spikar hai
 In his absence on Independence Day, Parrikar had chosen Sawant to hoist the national flag
 agar tendulkar yaa nike kaa naam mukhyamantri ke liye tay kiya jaataa he, to kam se kam ek vidhayak ko istipha dena padegaa taaki upachunaav karaayaa ja sake
 Though most of the mlas are satisfied with Naik's name, Parrikar is yet to get the green signal in his name
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki mukhyamantri ke naam par parrikar ko hi haa karnaa he

 in / Online shopping can be expensive as soon as GST is implemented from 1 July
 iske peeche vajah bhi he
 As soon as GST is implemented, e-commerce companies will need to collect 1% TCS (tax Collection at Source) while making payment to their suppliers
 ise dekhte hue philpcart, amejan sahit kai i-commers companiyaan kai ofer ke saath online khariddaari par jabardast chhot de rahi he
 There is a discount of up to 80% on the price of many goods
 abhi in companiyon ko tisies nahin dena pad rahaa he, lekin jaise hi jiesti lagu hoga, unhen yah tex dena padegaa or iskaa boj upabhoktaaon par padegaa
 For this reason, these companies want to eliminate more and more of their stock
 tippaniyan Knowledgeable e-commerce Dr
 amit moheshwari bataate hai ki 'abhi tak i commers vyapaariyon par koi tex nahin tha
 Now 1% tax will be levied and this burden will reach the consumer '
 jiesti network portal ne i-commers operators kaa registration 25 june se sweekaar karnaa shuru kar diya he
 In view of the huge rush, the date of implementation of GST of all registrations i
e
 before July 1 is unlikely
 isse sarkaar ne kuch samay ke liye inhen tex dene se chhot de di he, yani abhi kuch or vakt tak online shoping karnaa kifaayati rahegaa
 However, after this decision, other traders are also demanding exemption from tax
 CAIT ke sachiv praveen khandelwal kaa kahana he ki 'sarkaar ne i commers waalon ko kuch din ke liye tex se chhot di he
 We demand that the rest of the traders also get a discount
 iske liye kapadaa vyapaaree bhi pradarshan kar rahe hai'
 If you are planning to shop, then before July, you can take advantage of the huge discounts going on online shopping
 or ye companiyaan ek din ke andar hi saamaan aap ke ghar tak bhi pahunchaa dengi, lekin jiesti lagane ke baad online or bazaar se shopping karnaa mahangaa padegaa

 CAIT Secretary Praveen Khandelwal says that the government has exempted e-commerce people from tax for a few days
 ham maang karte hai ki baaki vyapaariyon ko bhi chhot mili
 Textile traders are also demonstrating for this'
 agar aap kharidari kaa man bana rahe hai to july se pehle online shopping kar chal rahi baari chhot kaa faaydaa le sakate hai
 And these companies will also deliver the goods to your home within a day, but after GST, it will be expensive to shop online and from the market

 vanprastha kii umr main balaatkaar kaa ilzaam jhel rahe asaram kii zaati zindagi main ek nayaa bhuuchaal aayaa he or ye bhuuchaal he asaram kii duusari bivi kii shakl main
 Yes, a woman who has come out in favor of Asaram, who is in jail, has claimed that he is Asaram's real wife and his relationship with Asaram is not a physical but a spiritual one
 kamaal kii baat ye he ki khud ko asaram kii bivi bataane vaali is mahila kaa bharaa-puraa parivaar he
 The new truth of Asaram is now exposed to the world, it is no less than a hunger for his entire family, because now the world has come before Manak Devi, who claims to be Asaram's second wife
 ji haa, ek aisi patni, jo khud ko naa to aam insaan maanati hai or naa hi duusari patniyon kii tarah
 Rather Manak Devi says that she is such a wife of Asaram, who is not in human form but in the form of God
 balaatkaar ke ilzaam main jail main band 72 saal ke asaram kaa vaqt pehle hi acha nahin guzar rahaa
 In the hope of bail, their breath is swirling around the courts
 zamaanat kii arzi dete-dete ab vakil bhi halkaan ho rahe hai or aise main maanak devi kaa ye nayaa patni avatar asaram ke liye kisi jatke se kam nahin or shaayad yahi vajah he ki ek taraf to maanak devi khud ko asaram kii ruhani jeevanasathi bataa rahi hai, to vahiin duusari taraf asaram use maansik rogi
 a long time has passed since Asaram went to jail
 wo lagaataar zamaanat kii arziyaan bhi detaa rahaa he lekin asaram ke liye adaalat kaa dil ab tak nahin pasija
 But in the meantime, Manak Devi, who appeared in the Jodhpur court, is seeing the love he is pouring out for this Prannath
 wo kahati hai ki asaram se unka naata aaj kaa nahin balki barason kaa he or ye rishta koi dhanka-chupa yaa gadha-buna nahin, balki saalon se jamaane ke saamne he
 Some five and a half years ago, when his brothers got him married to Asaram, he also gave a wedding feast to thousands of people by spending millions of rupees
 lekin in tamaam baton ke bich jo baat sabase ahm he, wo ye he ki agar maanak devi hi asaram kii patni hai, to phir asaram kii pehali patni lakshmi devi koun he? zaahir he, asaram ko jail jane ke kareeb saadhe paanch maheene ke baad maanak devi ke prakat hone par hamane khud maanak devi se hi ye sawaal puch liya or unhone jo jawaab diya, wo bhi kam chaunkaanewaala nahin tha
 Manak said that Lakshmi is not his wife because neither Asaram is a common man nor Lakshmi Devi
 asaram to bhagwaan kaa avatar he or lakshmi se uske vaise rishte nahin hai, jaise aam insaanon main hote hai
 Apparently, there are many punishments in the words of Manak Devi and Asaram, who was implicated in rape charges, is now getting entangled in these screws
 pehali baar jab maanak ne bhi apane gharavaalon se asaram se apni shaadi ho jane kii baat bataai, to gharavaalon kii bhi hairaani kaa koi parawar nahin rahaa
 But with time, he came to understand that now Asaram's effect on Manak is speaking up
 maanak devi kii zindagi pehle aisi nahin thi
 His life was going well with his entire family
 maanak ko shaadi ke baad teen bachche bhi hue lekin isi bich maanak kii zindagi ek rose aisi badali ki jisane puure parivaar kii takadir hi badal kar rakh di
 Some 15 years ago today, Manak Devi had once visited Asaram's ashram and just this day she came under Asaram's influence in such a way that she could never come out of it again
 pehle-pahal to unke in daavon par gharavaalon ne unhen samajhane-bujhane kii koshish kii or maamla shant hota rahaa lekin dhire-dhire haalat ye ho gai ki wo ek baar ashram jaatin, to phir laut kar ghar aane kaa naam hi nahin leti or to or jab tak khud asaram use ashram main ghar lautne kaa hukum nahin detaa, tab tak maanak asaram kaa ashram nahin chhodti
 Now call it the effect of Asaram's hypnosis, black magic or something else, for Manak Devi, this ashram was her husband's home and her whereabouts
 gharavaalon kii maane to maanak devi par asaram kaa asar aaj se nahin saalon se he
 He says that once Manak Devi went to Asaram's ashram with a jewelery worth lakhs of rupees from his house, after that she returned but the jewels did not meet again
 is baar bhi jab asaram ko giraftaar kar jodhpur jail le jaaya gaya, maanak unki mizaajapursi ke liye jail ke baahar chali gai thim or isi bhagdaud main apni taang bhi tudwa baithi
 After this, the people of Asaram and Ashram did not ask him, although the people of the house continued to serve Manak
 haalat ye he ki maanak kaa asaram se thik kaisaa rishta he, ab ye khud unke gharavaalon kaa bhi samaj main nahin aa rahaa he
 But Manak believes that his relationship with Asaram is similar to that of Parvati to Lord Shiva and like Lakshmi to Narayan
 vaise to maanak devi khud ko asaram kii patni kaaphi dinon se bataati rahi hai lekin ab jis tarah ne unhone khuleam asaram se is rishte kaa elaan kiya he, wo khud unke gharavaalon se lekar asaram ke kunbe tak sabko chaunkaa gaya he

 The All India Tennis Association (AITA) has finally succumbed to a crucial confrontation between the two biggest names in Indian tennis, but it has also dealt a major blow to the Indian tennis team's chances of winning the gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics
 landan olympic main liender pes ke saath jodidar ke rup main vishnuvardhan ko utaara jayega, jabaki mahesh bhupati or rohan bopanna kii jodi ko barkaraar rakhaa gaya he, or mixd dubles spardhaa main pes or sania mirza kii jodi court par utregi
 The comments saaf he landan olympic main bharat kii ore se do team bheji ja rahi hai
 The biggest question here is whether Pace would accept the AITA decision, as he had already written a letter to AITA clearly stating that he would not play in the Olympics with any junior player
 sutron se mil rahi jaankaree ke mutabik liender eitie ke is faisle se khush nahin hai, lekin pes ne philhal eitie ko koi jawaab bhi nahin diya he
 In such a situation, if Pace withdraws his name from the Olympics, then the headache of AITA will increase, but on the other hand, Mahesh Bhupathi's father Krishna is happy with this decision of AITA
 media se baat karte hue unhone kaha ki mahesh or rohan olympic main medal jeet sakate hai, lekin bharat ko mixd dubles main medal milane kii zyada sambhaavna he
 Krishna also said that Leander is a great player who encourages young players at any time
 landan se medal aata he yaa nahin, yah kahana jaldbaaji hogi, lekin tay he ki jo kuch pichley ek hafte main hua, usne bhartiya tennis ko nuksaan zarur pahunchaaya he
 Vishnuvardhan will be roped in as a partner with Leander Paes at the London Olympics, while the duo of Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna are retained, and Paes and Sania Mirza will take on the court in the mixed doubles event
 tippaniyan It is clear that two teams are being sent by India in the London Olympics
 sabase bada sawaal yahaan yah he ki kya pes ko eitie kaa yah faisla manjuur hoga, kyonki unhone pehle hi eitie ko chitthee likhakar saaf kah diya tha ki vah kisi bhi junior khilaadi ke saath olympic main nahin khelenge
 According to information from sources, Leander is not happy with this decision of AITA, but Paes has not given any reply to AITA for the time being
 aise main agar pes olympic se apana naam waapas le lete hai to eitie kaa sirdard bad jayega, lekin duusari ore mahesh bhupati ke pita krishna eitie ke is faisle se khush hai
 Talking to the media, he said that Mahesh and Rohan can win medals in Olympics, but India is more likely to get medals in mixed doubles
 krishna ne yah bhi kaha ki liender ek shandaar khilaadi hai, jo kisi bhi vakt yuva khilaadiyon ko kaaphi protsaahit karte hai
 It is too early to say whether the medal comes from London, but it is certain that whatever happened in the last one week has definitely damaged Indian tennis
 saaf he landan olympic main bharat kii ore se do team bheji ja rahi hai

 No bail is promised to anyone in the name of Ram
 chunaav jab saamne hai to dekhte jaaie ki ram kaa naam abhi kitne rang dikhaata he

 CRPF, ITBP, SSB, BSF and DRG have started sending such a message that the Naxalites should give up arms or they will be killed like their allies
 sthaneey police ko bhi is abhiyaan main shaamil kar kaha gaya he ki wo aatmasamarpan karne ke icchhuk naksaliyon or unke sahyogiyon se baatcheet kaa maahaul taiyaar karen
 There are no posters, flakes and hoardings in the hundreds of villages within the jungles of Bastar, these days with messages of welcome and congratulations from a leader and politician
 balki un naksaliyon ko tarjeeh di gai he jinhone khun kharaba, hatya, aagjanee, lutpaat or barudi surangen bicha kar police or kendriya suraksha balon ke javaanon or aam nagarikon kii jaan lene main koi kasar baaki nahin chodi he
 The prize money declared on the heads of those infamous Naxalites is also recorded with their photographs
 iske saath police or kendriya suraksha balon ke phone or mobile number bhi likhe gaye hai
 So that citizens can report the activities of Naxalites
 number dene kaa makasad yah bhi he ki yadi koi naksali aatmasamarpan karnaa chahta he to wo apni suvidhanusaar police or kendriya suraksha balon se sampark kar saktaa he
 Through these flakes, the government has made it clear that the Naxalites either surrender or be ready to die
 barish ke mausam ke jate hi police or kendriya suraksha balon ne nayi ranneeti ke tahat jangalon main daakhil hone kaa sankalp liya he
 For this, social and community policing is being made effective
 jangal ke bheetar nae mobile tower sthapit kiye ja rahe hai
 Electricity is being provided in many villages
 jin gaanv main bijli stesan banane main aadchan aa rahi he, vahaan solar energy plant laga kar gharon main roshni laane kaa kaam joro par he

 According to Awasthi, "now we are engaged in uprooting Naxalites' feet
 " ve bataate hai, "police or kendriya suraksha balon ke jawan hathiyaar kaa istemaal karne ke saath-saath vikaas kaa kaam bhi karenge
 "according to him, the personnel of the central security forces have worked hard to find the youth who want to become responsible citizens
 aise naujavaanon ko unki ruchi anusaar padhai-likhaai, takneekee or gaiyr takneekee prashikshan diya ja rahaa he
 To provide them employment, the campaign has been launched
 bastar ke dantewada , bijapur, sukama, narayanpur, antahgarh, kondagaanv, kanker, abujhmaad jaise durgam sthanon menkukhyat naksaliyon ke photoflax lagaae gaye hai
 Seeing those pictures, the villagers are no longer having difficulty in identifying the Naxalite
 iske pehle tak naksaliyon kii choti tasviren yaa phir unke pahanaave ko lekar tasdik kiya janaa graminon ke liye dur kii kaudi sabit hota tha
 But now it is not so
 flax main lagi badi tasviren kukhyatanakliyon kii kahanibayan karne lagi hai
 However, police and central security forces fear that the Naxalites will destroy these flakes and hoardings as soon as they get the chance
 kyonki unke pahachaane jane or shinakhti kaa khatra jo bad gaya he

 bhartiya janata party kii dilli vidhansabha chunaav main karaari haar ke kya sabak hai? bijepi ke ek varisht netaa chehre par muskaraahat ke saath kehete hai, ''jammu-kashmir main hamaari sarkaar ban rahi he

 However, by forming a government in Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP wants to deliver a message at the national level, recovering from the atmosphere of frustration
 haalanki dilli chunaav ke baad bijepi ke kendriya netritv ko ehsaas ho gaya he ki korporate style main sanghathan ko nahin chalaaya ja saktaa
 But now the party's big goal is Bihar and the Sangh too does not want to miss this opportunity
 isliye dilli kii haar se sabak lekar pradesh ikai ko saaf nirdesh diya gaya he ki kisi bhi bahari ko party main shaamil karte vakt tikaton kaa bharosa na diya jaae
 Not only this, after the defeat of Delhi, BJP did not put more obstacles in forming Nitish Kumar's government rather than sabotage in JD (U)
 shah ke ek kareebi netaa kehete hai, ''ab kaaryakartaaon ko bolne kaa mauka mil gaya he jo abhi tak chup the
 "but what kind of change in the working style of the organization will be taken, only after the meeting of the All India House of Representatives of the Sangh to be held in Nagpur after Holi on the report of the defeat of Delhi

 The Sangh increased the bjp's problems by calling a report
 haar kii samiksha ke liye bijepi ne kendriya str par abhi koi aupchaarik baithak nahin kii he
 Instead of seeking a report of the defeat from Delhi BJP, National President Amit Shah has asked organization general secretary Ramlal to make a report
 raamalaal ne is kadi main pradesh bijepi ke prabharee prabhaat jha, pradesh adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay or sambandhit kshetra ke saansadon ke saath saat baithken puri kar lee hai
 In view of the factionalism in the state unit, the possibility of major surgery is being raised, after the results, a senior leader who played a role in the elections from the center, after seeing the lines of concern on the faces of the leaders of Delhi BJP, consoled the workers, " Don't worry too much is chunaav ke nateezon ne sabake munh par kaalikh pot di he or koi kisi ko kuch kehane kii sthiti main nahin he
 The gesture of this senior leader was clear that the state unit was not taken into confidence in the elections in Delhi
 haalanki pradesh bijepi ke prabharee prabhaat jha chunavi manthan par kuch bhi kehane se inkaar karte hai
 He says, "I would just like to say that we were able to sense the mood of the country, but could not understand the mood of Delhi

 According to sources, in this meeting Bhaiyya ji asked, "it is the defeat of the organization or the government
" '' is baithak main sangh ne bijepi netaaon kii jamkar class lee
 BJP leaders were asked that the party has placed so much emphasis on the membership drive and is claiming to have made 5-6 crore members, but what is the advantage when it does not get votes by becoming a big party
 sutron ke mutabik, is netaa ne kaha ki bijepi kii sadsy sankhya to aise bad rahi he jaise koi pahalwaan rojaanaa apni dand baithak kaa aankada badha rahaa ho
 According to the sources of the Sangh Parivar, the BJP had sought help from the Sangh for booth management three days before voting, seeing that the last hand was out and it sent a message that despite losing the strength of the Sangh, the BJP lost badly
 sangh netaaon kii daleel thi ki bijepi apni aantarik kalah main sangh ko na laae
 The confusion over the strategy has not given the BJP any major reason for defeat
 lekin sutron ke mutabik, sanghathan mahasachiv raamalaal kii report main bahut se aise tathy ubharkar aaen hai jo sidhe kendriya netritv ko kathghare main khadaa karte hai
 However, it is not yet decided whether the party will submit the report to the RSS as it is
 yah to lagbhag sabhi maan rahe hai ki chunaav ke liye centre, pradesh or sangh ke str par ban rahi ranneetiyon main koi talmail nahin tha
 Then, the strategy to field 200 mps and appoint outside activists-leaders also failed
 baahar se aane vaale zyaadaatar log sthaneey kaaryakartaaon ke saath bos jaisaa vyavhaar karne lage
 In the ticket distribution also, the faces rejected from the Aam Aadmi Party were preferred

 Similarly, MP Manoj Tiwari was also seeking ticket for his MP representative from Burari seat, Udit Raj was also seeking ticket for his nephew, while MP Meenakshi Lekhi was against giving ticket to Nupur Sharma compared to Kejriwal

 MP Mahesh Giri, who handled his election management, got Hukum Singh a ticket from Kondli
 iske alaava dilli kii aabaadi ke badale sameekaran par bhi dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 The Aam Aadmi Party gave tickets to 14 Purvanchalis and all came out winning, but the BJP gave the ticket by fixing the quota of Purvanchal instead of seats
 kiran bedi ko laane main bhi sthaneey netaaon ko bharose main nahin liya gaya
 Senior leaders like Harsh Vardhan were also informed on the phone to contest Bedi from Krishnanagar seat
 prachaar main bijepi kii sabase badi bhul congress ko mukaable se baahar rakhkar puri ranneeti aap ko gherne ke hisaab se bananaa rahi
 This turned all the votes of the Congress towards Kejriwal
 haar kii report main mustafabad, vishwasanagar jaise siton kaa zikr he jahaan congress ne adhik vot hasil kiye to bijepi kii jeet hui
 According to sources, Modi's 10 lakh suit also got the wrong message and the language style in which the Prime Minister called Kejriwal as Naxalite, anarchist, also hurt people
 party ne prachaar saamagree main updravi gotra, anna ke photo par maala aadi ke jariye rahi-sahi kasar puri kar di
 There is a lot going on in the Delhi BJP that activists, angry with the autocratic style of Modi and Shah, responded in Delhi
 jald hi dijal or alpiji kii keemten bad sakati hai
 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has indicated this
 sambhaavna he ki sarkaar bajet satr ke baad yah kadam uthaa sakati he
 In response to a question in Parliament, the Finance Minister said that after the budget session, he will talk to the heads of state governments political parties on this issue

 dilli metro ke liye saal 2017 kii shuruyaat acchhee nahin rahi he
 In the month of January itself, the metro has been exposed to technical faults four times
 dilli kii shaan kahi jane vaali is shandaar sawari ke liye ye acha sanket nahin
 How serious and worrying these malfunctions are for the Metro can be gauged from the fact that DMRC has to apologize to the commuters
 lekin aakhir dilli metro main ye kharabi aa kyon rahi he? kyundilli metromen baar-baar technical folt aa rahe hai? in saare sawaalon kaa jawaab talashne ke dauraan das badi vajahen saamne ain
 These are the reasons, which are also a challenge for the metro and the weakness of the metro is also becoming
 
 
 1
 The number of metro passengers has been recorded
 ek din main 32 lakh log safar kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, there are becoming more and more problems for the metro system, because even a small technical fault due to congestion causes the entire metro system to stall
 kyonki takneekee kharabi ko thik karne main jo vakt lagata he, utani der me metro steshnon par bheed kii vajah se duusari tamaam samasyaayein shuru ho jaati hai
 2
 metro ne pichley maheene disambar main hi apane oparation ke 14 saal puure kiye hai or in 14 saalon main metro kaa trek system purana ho chukaa he, jise lagaataar mentanence kii zarurat hoti he
 But the metro remains in operation on the track from five in the morning till one o'clock in the night, so there is very little time for improvement work and if there are any faults during the day, then the services of the metro are badly affected
 3
 Tripping in the OHE or overhead electricity line of the metro is also a major cause of trouble for the Delhi Metro
 khaastaur par blue line or yelo line par oechai main folt kii vajah se kai baar metro kii raftaar par brake lag chukaa he
 4
 metro tren kaa paintograph bhi takneekee kharabiyon kii ek badi vajah he
 Due to sparking in the pantograph, there has been a fire in the metro many times and there have been cases of smoke, after which the train has to be removed from service after the metro has been evacuated
 5
 The rolling stock of the metro, that is, the wagon of the train, the age of the wheel is also quite old
 jo train metro ke shuruaati dinon main laai gai thi, ab unamem kharabi aane lagi he
 6
 metro main power felyar bhi ek aam samasya ho chali he
 Due to power failure, the services of the metro are stopped
 haalanki metro ke paas aisi suvidha he, jisase bijli gul hone kii sthiti main metro train ko surangon se nikaalkar platform yaa steshnon tak laayaa ja sake, lekin aisa karne ke dauraan metro kii sevaayen buree tarah prabhavit ho jaati hai
 7
 metro kaa puraa system automatic train oparation par chalata he
 In such a situation, if there is any problem in the software even for a few minutes, then there is chaos in the whole system
 8
 Signaling system in the metro is also a major reason for the malfunction of the metro, where the malfunction requires manual operation several times
 isse metro kii raftaar kam kerani hoti he
 9
 metro steshnon par platform khule hue hai
 In such a situation, due to congestion, many passengers fall on the trek or the cases of suicide are also becoming a problem for the metro
 10
 a problem also comes from the mistakes of the passengers or breaking the rules
 kai baar musafir bina vajah immergency batan dabaate hai yaa phir kai baar band ho rahe daravaajon ko band hone se roak dete hai, door obstrection kii vajah se bhi metro kii seva prabhavit hoti he

 Underworld don Dawood Ibrahim is a big name in the world of underworld but little brother Iqbal Kaskar will be known by very few people
 ikbaal kaskar par bhi macoka ke tahat gambhir aarope lag chuke hai or pehle bhi use khatm karne kii sajeesh rachi ja chuki he
 It is believed that currently Iqbal Kaskar has a business of transacting real estate and property in Mumbai, but there was a time when in many cases Iqbal Kaskar used to visit the court-court
 2003 se pehle ikbaal dubai main rahata tha lekin 19 march 2003 main hindustan lautne par use hawaondde se hi giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Iqbal Kaskar was charged under MCOCA
 police ne ikbaal kaskar par aarope lagaaya ki wo daaud ke liye kaam karata he or jameen maalikon ko behad kam keemat par jameen bechney ke liye dhamkata he
 Iqbal Kaskar's name was also involved in the Sara Sahara case of Mumbai
 daaud ibrahim kaa chota bhai hone kii vajah se ikbaal kaskar kaa naam har baar kaale dhandhe se joda gaya lekin june 2007 ke adalati aadesh main kaha gaya ki kaskar ke khilaaf koi thos saboot nahin he lihaaja use bari kiya jaae
 The underworld stains on Kaskar were erased, but perhaps his life-related threats did not diminish

 donon ke bich talmail naa hone se batan par likhe ummidavaar kaa naam alag tha or vivipat main pehle se feed data chunki delit nahin kiya gaya tha
 Therefore, according to previous data on the slip print was coming

 lekin yahaan bhind main pradarshan ke dauraan iviem alag thi or vivipat kaa data puraani govindnagar vaali iviem se mail khaataa tha
 So there was a mess
