 Wasim Rizvi has advocated for Muslims to sit at the settlement table and hand it over to Hindus
 wasim rizvi ne kaha ki us kalank ko masjid kahana gunaahe azim he kyonki masjid ke neeche kii khudaai 137 mazdooron ne kii thi jisamen 52 musalmaan the
 During that excavation, a platform of bricks was also found in the bottom of the pillars of 50 temples
 unhone daawa kiya ki khudaai ke dauraan mandir se jude kul 265 puraane avshesh mili the
 Based on this, the Archaeological Department of India (ASI) had reached the decision that a temple was buried under the Babri Masjid on the upper surface
 sidhe taur se mana jaae ki babari in mandiron ko todakar inke malbe par banaai gai he
 Regarding the construction of Babri Masjid on the wreckage of the demolished temples, Rizvi said that it has also been mentioned in KK Mohammed's book 'I am Indian'
 aisi sthiti main us babari kalank ko jaij masjid kahana islamic siddhanton ke vipareet he
 He further said that there is still time for people to join Babri Masjid, stop their sins and follow the Islam of Hazrat Mohammad
 aatanki abu bakr, umr kii vichaardhaara ko chhod ek samjhaute kii mej par baithkar haar jeet ke bagaiyr ram kaa haq hinduon ko waapas karo or ek nai aman kii masjidalakhanaumen jaij paison se banane kii pahal caroisse pehlesia central board ke chairman wasim rizvipuja sthal (vishesh praavdhaan) adhinium-1991 ko khatm karne kii maang kar chuke hai
 According to Rizvi, the disputed mosques have been secured under the Places of Worship (special Provisions) Act
 unhen hinduon ko saunpane main mushkil hogi, isliye ise khatm kiya jaae
 Rizvi abolished this act, as well as 9 mosques that were built during the Mughal period by demolishing temples, including Ayodhya, Kashi, Mathura, Qutub Minar, a total of 9 mosques
 unhen waapas hinduon ko saunpane kii maang kar chuke hai
 He has also demanded that a special committee should be informed about the disputed mosques under the supervision of the court
 agar yah siddh ho jaataa he ki yah hinduon ke dharm sthalon ko todakar banaaya gaya he to phir unhen hinduon ko waapas kiya jaae
 Rizviya has even said that there was never a mosque at that place in Ayodhya and there can never be a mosque there
 yah bhagwaan ram kaa janmasthan he or vahaan keval ram mandir banaaya jayega

 uri, baraamula or pampor
 One thing is common among these three is that there was a terrorist attack in these three places
 baat itani hi nahin he in teenon jagahon par aatanki pani ke raste aae
 Paved the way for the attacks of Jhelum's river
 surakshabalon ke liye ye chintaa kaa vishay he ki aatanki ab ghuspaith ke liye nadi kaa sahaara lene lage hai
 That is, it is not easy to reach the place of attack as well as to resort to water for infiltration and to deal with it
 saaf he jab jamini raste par chaukasee badi to aatanki vikalp ke taur par pani kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 According to intelligence sources, in the terrorist training camps across the border, special training is also being given to the terrorists to swim, so that the terrorists can remain under deep water for hours
 tippaniyan Let us tell you that the places where terrorists have attacked in Baramulla, Uri and Pampore are all around the rivers
 ye bhi pataa chalaa he sargical strike ke baad pakistan ne seemaa ke paas chal rahe apane aatanki campon ko shift to kiya hi he saath hi kashmir ghati main hamale ke liye apni ranneeti main badlaav kiya he
 Earlier the fidayeen attackers carried out the attack immediately after the infiltration, but now after the infiltration, the sleeper takes shelter with the help of the cell
 iske baad sainya campon yaa phir sainya kafila kii suraksha vyavastha kii jaanch padtaal ke baad hamale karte hai
 It is a matter of concern for the security forces that the terrorists are now resorting to the river for infiltration
 yani hamale kii jagah pahunchane ke saath-saath ghuspaith ke liye bhi pani kaa sahaara or isse nipatna aasaan nahin he
 It is clear that when vigilance increases on the ground, then terrorists are resorting to water as an alternative
 khufia sutron ke mutabik sarhad paar ke aatanki training campon main aatankiyon ko tairne ke liye bhi special training di ja rahi he jisase aatanki ghanton tak gahare pani ke bheetar rah sakate hai
 The comments aapako ye bataa den ki baraamula, uri or pampor main jin jin jagahon par aatankiyon ne hamalaa kiya he wo sabhi nadiyon ke aasapaas hi hai
 It is also learned that after the surgical strike, Pakistan has not only shifted its terrorist camps running near the border and has also changed its strategy for attack in Kashmir valley
 pehle fidaayin hamalavar ghuspaith ke tunrat baad hamale ko anjaam dete the, lekin ab ghuspaith ke baad sleeper cell kii madad se pehle panaah lete hai
 After this, they attack after checking the security of military camps or military convoys
 saaf he jab jamini raste par chaukasee badi to aatanki vikalp ke taur par pani kaa sahaara le rahe hai

 The year 2016 has been a challenge for the Indian stock market
 saal ke shuruaati maheenon main vaishvik dabaav se bazaar daraa hua tha
 The budget of the Central Government in March gave the market a chance to take a strong turn
 phir badhiyaan monsoon, jiesti lagu karne kii kavayad or byaaj daron main katautee ke elaan bazaar ke liye acchhee khabar lekar aae
 But in the last months of the year, the US presidential election and the decision of demonetisation in the country once again shocked the market
 ab 2017 bhartiya share bazaar ke liye kaaphi kuch 2016 jaisaa hi rahanaa hai kyonki 2016 kii ye 5 ghatnaayen bazaar par apana asar banaae rakhengi
 1
 notebandi se karporate sector kii teesri timahi ke nateezon par dabaav kaayam rahegaa
 However, due to the increasing efforts towards cashless economy in the country, companies will start benefiting from the new financial year in 2017

 This benefit can be used by the central government to invest in infrastructure in the country after April, which will give a signal to the stock market
 3
 In economies around the world, 2016 has been a cut in interest rates
 bhartiya share bazaar par 2016 ke dauraan america main byaaj dar badhane kaa khatra lagaataar rahaa
 But at the end of the year, the Reserve Bank lowered interest rates and interest rates were raised in the US in a week
 america kii yah kavayad ubharate bazaaron se videshi nivesh ko khinchne ke liye kiya gaya he

 bhartiya share bazaar ne 29 farvari 2016 ko saal ke apane nichle str ko tab chuaa jab vitt mantri arun jetali ne apana vaarshik bajet pesh kiya tha
 This budget caused market fluctuations in the months ahead
 ab farvari 2017 main ek baar phir vitt mantri ke saamne bajet ke jariye bazaar ko majboot karne kii chunauti he
 In the upcoming budget, efforts will be made to remove the weaknesses of the 2016 budget
 5
 The Central Government has formed a consensus on the implementation of GST in 2016

 As soon as this is implemented, there may be initial pressure on the stock market, but by the end of 2017, the market may touch new heights
 haalanki jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki notebandi kaa prabhaav jald se jald khatm hone kii sthiti main jiesti lagu karnaa bazaar ko majbootee degaa

 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne pashchim bengal main jin do siton par jeet hasil kii thi, unamem se ek darjeeling sansadeey kshetra shaamil he
 The bjp's victory in the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat was eased in the last elections with the support of Modi wave and Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (gojamu)
 naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak 2016 ke sahare pashchim bengal main apane liye raste talash rahi bijepi kaa abhi darjeeling loksabhaa seat par kabja he or surendrajit singh ahaluwalia saansad he
 In the 2009 elections, bjp's Jaswant Singh came to Parliament after choosing from Darjeeling
 baharhaal, kabhi vam morcha kaa garh rahe pashchim bengal main bijepi apane liye sambhaavnaaen talash rahi he
 In most parts of the country, the Modi wave showed its effect, but despite this, BJP could win only two seats in this state, Darjeeling and Asansol
 haalanki darjeeling loksabhaa seat par bijepi kaa 2009 se kabja he
 The 2014 elections saw a close fight between the BJP and the Trinamool Congress

 73 fisadi vot ke saath jeet hasil kii thi
 While Baichung Bhutia of Trinamool Congress got 2,91,018 votes, which is 25 of the total voting
 47 fisadi he
 The most interesting is that in the 2009 elections, the Trinamool Congress was not in the scene on this seat, but in the 2014 elections, the party led by Mamata Banerjee finished second, while the CPI (M) slipped to the third position
 2009 ke chunaavon main bijepi ke jaswant singh 4,97,649 vot yani 51
 50 percent of the votes were received, but in 2014 it was reduced to 42
 73 fisadi par pahunch gaya
 In this context, even though the BJP is looking at possibilities for itself in West Bengal, its declining vote percentage in Darjeeling tells a different story
 darjeeling kaa sansadeey itihaashparyatakon kii pasand or chaay ke bagaanon ke liye janaa jane vaala darjeeling sansadeey kshetra 1957 main astitv main aayaa he or us saal hue chunaavon main yahaan congress ke theodor manen janpratinidhi chunakar sansad pahunche the

 In 1989 elections for the Ninth Lok Sabha, Indrajit of Gorkha National Liberation Front managed to win the election
 baad main indrajit congress main shaamil ho gaye or 1991 main phir hue chunaavon main congress kii tikat par vah dobaaraa jitkar sansad pahunche

 tiktaoc (tiktok) par rozaana lakhon-karodon videos aplod hote hai, jinhen online yugers behad pasand karte hai
 You can guess the popularity of Tittock from the fact that the matter reached the Supreme Court a few days ago for banning it
 is dauraan kai logon ne iske bain ke khilaaf aawaaj bhi uthaai, vahiin kai aise bhi the jo iske samarthan main the
 However, in recent times Tiktok has emerged as an app that has given superstars status to the most common people
 wo log jinaki koi jaan-pahchaan yaa solid becoground nahin he ve bhi is app ke jariye star ban gaye
 Lakhs of people started following him due to his short videos or, say, 15 second clips and this became a source of his income too
 vaise to is app ke desh-videsh main dheron aise creatre hai jinke lakhon folbers hai, lekin ham yahaan par aapako bharat ke top 10 tiktaoc stars ke bare main bataa rahe hai
 
 har roj 21 lakh signal paar kar 3 karod se zyada yatriyon ko apane mukaam tak pahunchaati he bhartiya rail
 But look at the other side, every year about 26,000 people die in railway accidents
 aadhe se zyada maamalon main in haadason ke liye railway ke karmchaaree hi jimmedaar hote hai
 In such a situation, how serious is the railway? After every accident, the railway administration promises to punish the driver or other employees responsible for it and get the incident investigated
 lekin haal hi main ek soochna kaa adhikaar (artiai) apil se hue khulaase ne is maamle main railway kii gambhirtha par hi sawalia nishaan laga diya he
 Despite being found guilty in the investigation, a large number of drivers are returning to their post or below
 haalanki railway maan chukaa he ki 62 fisadi rail haadase uske karmchaariyon kii naakaami kii vajah se hote hai
 In response to the RTI appeal, responses have been received so far from four regional offices (out of 17) and eight divisional offices (out of 67)
 inke mutabik, janvari, 2005 se november, 2011 ke bich haadason main doshi paae gaye 132 driveron ko naukari se hataaya gaya or 35 ko jabaran sevanivritti di gai
 On the other hand these drivers filed mercy petitions in the railways
 natijatan 23 driver apane mul pad par hi behaal ho gaye
 The less fortunate 39 drivers managed to return to a slightly lower position
 yani salaakhon ke peeche janaa to dur, 167 doshi driveron main se 62 apni naukari paane main kaamyaab ho gaye
 Some of the drivers who have returned to the lower rank will be eligible to return to the old rank after three years
 yahaan spasht kar den ki sabase zyada kramshah 36 or 29 driveron ko naukari se hataane vaale uttar-madhya railway (elahabaad) or purv-madhya railway (hajipur) ne apil ke baad behaal kiye gaye driveron ke bare main koi bhi record uplabdh karaane se inkaar kar diya
 Obviously, this number may increase
 agra ke ashok kumaar ne apni artiai yachika main railway board se poocha tha ki ''rail haadason ke liye puure taur par doshi paae gaye kitne driveron ko dayaa apil ke aadhaar par naukari main le liya gaya?'' kumaar kii apil ke peeche ek vajah thi
 In May last year, he himself became a witness to a railway accident near Delhi's Faridabad
 ''haadase ke baad maine driver se poocha ki aap ke upar kya karrwai hogi? usne chaltau dhang se mujhase kaha ki jaanch chalegi or baad main main phir se naukari par aa jaaoongaa
 "kumar was really shocked
 unhen andeh hone laga ki doshi driveron ke khilaaf koi sakhti hoti bhi he yaa nahin
 Look at the attitude of the Railway Board taking every important and big decision
 dandit kiye jane vaale driveron ke bare main byora uske paas rahata he lekin artiai kaa usne sidhe koi jawaab na diya
 Instead, she applied for various regional and divisional offices to wander into the labyrinth
 kumaar ko ab tak jin jagahon se jawaab mili hai
 India Today obtained the same figures directly from the Railway Board
 inke mutabik, janvari, 2005 se disambar, 2011 ke bich railway ne 226 driveron ko haadason kaa doshi paae jane par naukari se nikaala yaa jabaran seva nivritti di
 These are the methods of removing an employee from the railway
 board ke mutabik dayaa apil ke baad 226 driveron main se 19 ko mul pad par or 78 ko nichle pad par behaal kiya gaya
 According to the number of places where answers have been received so far, according to the same period 23 drivers were restored to the original post, while according to the board, only 19 drivers were restored to the original across the country
 aakhir kaise behaal ho jate hai doshi driver? dayaa yachikaaon ke peeche railway main kuch khichdi to nahin pak rahi? railway board ke chairman vinay mittal ne to india today kii kai koshishon ke baavjood baat karnaa hi munasib na samajha
 Board spokesperson Anil Kumar Saxena tried his best to put his side
 yahi ki yatriyon kii suraksha ko lekar railway bahut sakht he
 Railways have clear rules to identify and punish the drivers responsible for the accidents
 ''jahaan tak dayaa yachika kaa sawaal he to prakritik nyaay kaa jo siddhant desh ke har naagarik par lagu hota he, vahi railway ke karmchaariyon ke liye bhi he
 Such employees appeal to the higher officer for decision against the verdict
 apiliy athurity kai maamalon main apil par vichaar karne ke baad karmchaaree ko riyaayat de detii he, lekin yah vistrut jaanch ke baad hi kiya jaataa he
 As such, the Railway Safety Commissioner investigates cases of deaths in an accident, which is an officer of some other department, not the Railways
 aise main driver ko seva main waapas lene ke maamle ko andeh se dekhne kaa sawaal hi kahaan paidaa hota he?''saxena kii maane to mul pad par vaapasi kaa yah matlab nahin ki driver ko phir se train chalaane ke hi kaam par lagaaya jayega
 "usually, he is given some other responsibility of equal status
 '' kaise yakeen karen in daavon par? ye daawey itane hi sahi hai to capatoun (dakshin africa) main 2005 main hue antarrashtriya rail suraksha sammelan main rail mantralay ke tatkaaleen nideshak (sefti) amitabh ne kyon kaha tha ki 1994 se 2004 ke bich 60 fisadi se zyada rail haadase railway karmchaariyon kii naakaami se hue?aaie ab jaraa un par najar daudaate hai, jo behaal hue
 Between 2005 and November 2011, 12 drivers were removed in New Delhi division of Northern Railway
 unhone jab apni sajaa ke khilaaf apil kii to unamem se nau nichle pad par behaal hone main kaamyaab rahe
 Keep in mind, truck drivers convicted in road accidents grind the mill in jail after a lengthy court process
 duusari ore railway ke driver bich main hi behaal hokar phir se naukari kaa majaa lete hai
 The situation of Ambala Cantonment Division of Northern Railway is also not very different
 yahaan usee avadhi main aath driveron ko naukari se hataaya gaya or ek ko jabaran sevanivritti di gai
 Punished drivers had to appeal
 unamem se chaar ko teen saal ke liye shanter ke nichle pad par bhej diya gaya
 After three years, these four will regain their original position
 do anya driveron ke maamle main naukari se hataae jane kii sajaa ko jabaran sevanivritti main badal diya gaya
 That means he also got the benefit
 purv tateey railway (bhubaneshwar) kaa haal dekhie
 Here almost all mercy petitions were decided in favor of the drivers
 16 driveron ko hataaya gaya or paanch ko jabaran sevanivritti di gai
 Out of these 21 drivers, 14 appealed against their sentence to higher authorities
 unamem se 13 dayaa praapt karne main kaamyaab rahe
 Five drivers returned directly to the original post, while eight were posted to lower positions
 isi tarah dakshin purv madhya railway ke bilaspur mandal main 23 driveron ko naukari se hataaya gaya or teen ko jabaran sevanivritti di gai
 After the mercy petition, 23 of these 26 managed to save their jobs and 10 returned to their original positions
 rail mantri dinesh trivedi ke griharajya pashchim bengal ke dakshin-purv railway (kolkata) main is dauraan 12 driveron ko seva se hataaya gaya or ek ko jabaran sevanivritti kaa dand mila
 Out of these 13, only three appealed and all three got back to the original position
 pashchim-madhya railway ke jabalpur mandal main chaar driveron ko seva se hataaya gaya or do ko jabaran sevanivritti di gai
 Five of these six jobs survived after the mercy appeal
 kota, hajipur, elahabaad, nagpur, ferozepur, agra or nagpur se mili jawaab bhi kuch isi tarah kii kahani bayaan karte najar aate hai
 Here the question arises that like other government departments, it takes a very long time to decide the responsibility of an accident in the railway too
 punarikshan apil ke baad shuru main doshi paae gaye driver akasar aasaani se batch nikalate hai
 Railways may have their own arguments about this, but according to the National Crime Records Bureau, since 2005, an average of 26,000 passengers lose their lives every year in railway accidents
 2010 main to maut kaa yah aankada 27,000 tak ja pahunchaa tha
 This mountain of death figures is not enough to warn the railway that it will save its mercy for special occasions and strictly treat the guilty drivers? ek video soshal media par viral ho gaya he jisamen teen sher sadak par chale je rahe hai
 They are walking gracefully, and the cars behind them are moving slowly behind them

 ab saaf ho gaya he ki dilli kaa chunavi dangal anna andolan ke do purv sahyogiyon ke bich hoga
 On one side there is 49 days former Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and on the other hand Kiran Bedi came to BJP 5 days ago
 somvaar raat kiran ko party ne aupchaarik taur par mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar chaunkaa diya
 BJP has got a strong face in the form of Kiran Bedi to contest against Arvind Kejriwal, but his 'parachute entry' is also raising some other questions
 haal ke dinon main bijepi jahaan-jahaan chunaav jiti, vahaan usne modi ke chahete or sangh-sweekrut netaaon ko hi kursi par baithaaya
 In Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana, there was no reliable party with an honest image compared to the BJP
 saath hi satta virdohi rujhaan bhi bijepi ke paksh main gaya
 But in his 49-day government in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party, which cheapened electricity and water, was a strong opponent for him
 isliye yahaan bijepi ko raajnneetik anubhav vaale sangh-sweekrut netaaon ko kursi dene kii niti tyaagni padi
 25 days before the election, she inducted the country's first woman IPS officer with zero political experience into the party and five days later declared her the chief ministerial candidate
 iskaa yahi matlab he ki bijepi ke paas kejariwal ke mukaable koi cheharaa nahin tha, jo unki lokapriyata or chhavi se takkar le sake
 In the name of Kiran Bedi, the question is openly discussed in the social media that if Kejriwal and his party were not in the contest, would the BJP have included Kiran Bedi bypassing its superiors? BJP president Amit Shah and his team understand that Kejriwal and his party are the only challenges for him in Delhi
 haal ke dinon main aae kai chunavi surveykshan arvind kejariwal ko dilli kaa chaheta mukhyamantri bataa rahe hai
 They have a good hold in 20 percent of the Dalit voters in Delhi
 gramin bahari dilli main bhi vah pichley chunaav ke mukaable majboot sthiti main dikh rahi he
 Therefore, BJP has not shied away from bringing even a face who has been a critic of BJP in the past
 yah bhi yaad rakhaa janaa chahie ki kiran bedi bijepi kii funding or gujarat dangon ke sambandh main narendra modi se twitor par safai bhi maang chuki hai
 But to win the election, both BJP and Kiran Bedi have not only forgotten the old count, but have also bought into the displeasure of their senior leaders of Delhi
 kiran bedi kii entry se bijepi ke liye ek khidki or khul gai he
 If the BJP stays away from the majority, it can save Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the responsibility of defeat with this window
 yani bijepi jiti to uskaa sehara modi lahar or amit shah netritv ke sir, or haari to thikra kiran bedi ke maththe
 Now the battle has clearly turned out to be Kiran Bedi vs Arvind Kejriwal
 lekin sawaal he ki 'chalo chalem modi ke saath' kaa naaraa bhi kya ab sanshodhit kiya jayega? a few days after Congress faced action to praise Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor led a cleanliness drive in Vizhinjam
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki iskaa koi raajnneetik matlab na nikaala jaae
 Tharoor was removed from the post of All India Congress Committee spokesperson after a complaint by the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee for praising Modi and supporting the campaign for 'swachh Bharat'
 tharur ne apane sansadeey kshetra main vizinjam bandargah ke paas ek sthaan se kachra hataaya
 Defending his active participation in the cleanliness drive, Tharoor said, 'this is not the prerogative of any political party and Mahatma Gandhi gave the message of keeping his surroundings clean
 ’jab tharur se poocha gaya ki kya unke in kaamon ko party dwaara jari chetavanee kaa ulanghan mana jayega, to unhone kaha, ‘gandhi ne kaha tha ki swatchta swatantraaa se zyada jaruri he
 But for Gandhi, the cleanliness of body and mind was equally important, which means that it is also important to free the heart from hatred and violence
 ’kerala kii rajdhani se duusari baar congress ke saansad bane tharur ne kaha ki eisisi ne congress ke kaaryakartaaon se bhi apil kii he ki ve gandhi jayanti se shuru kiye gaye ek maah lambey safai abhiyaan se juden
 input language congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi purvi uttar pradesh kaa prabhaar die jane ke baad pehali baar lakhanu pahunchi
 On this occasion, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi also did a twelve-km road show from the airport to the Congress office
 road sho main utsaah se las congressi kaaryakartaaon kii bheed bhi juty lekin ant main priyanka gandhi jab bina kuch bole nikal gayi to in kaaryakartaaon ko kuch maayusi bhi hui
 Lucknow was looking at Priyanka's path since morning
 congress kii nai mahasachiv ke is pehle raajnneetik safar par sabaki nazar thi
 Priyanka Gandhi was accompanied by Rahul Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia
 lakhanu main congress mukhyalay main manch sajaayaa ja rahaa tha
 Priyanka reached Lucknow in the afternoon
 unka kaafila khule raste chhod shahar kii kuch tang or bheedbhad vaali sadakon se chalaa
 Due to the dangling wires in the middle, the bus had to leave the roadshow and resort to the SUV
 hajratganj ke paas laal baag main ek choti si nukkad sabha hui
 Here too Rahul appeared with his well-known agenda
 chah baje ke qareeb ye kaafila congress mukhyalay pahunchaa
 Priyanka, Rahul, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Raj Babbar came on the decorated stage
 phir sabaki nazar priyanka par tikin
 But first Raj Babbar and then Rahul started speaking
 lekin priyanka chup raheen
 She came off the stage
 achaanak ek lamhe ke liye us bheed main bhi ek sannata sa khinchaa
 The glow of this entire roadshow, like Priyanka, did not say anything
 bharat ne pipipi netaa bilaval bhutto jaradaari kii is tippanee ko 'hakeekat se koson dur' bataaya he ki unki party samooche kashmir ko isse waapas legi
 India has also said that the integrity and unity of the country is not worth negotiating
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa saiyad akbaruddin ne bataaya, 'ham aage dekhne kii prakriya main jute hue hai or aage kii chizon ko lekar utsuk hone kaa matlab yah nahin he ki hamaari simaaen badal jaaengi
 We have made it very clear that the integrity and unity of India is not negotiable as far as we are concerned
 ' unhone kaha ki yah tippanee hakeekat se koson dur he jo hamen pichhali sadi main waapas le jaaegi
 The BJP has termed Bilawal Bhutto's statement as 'childish and immature'
 kashmir ko bharat kaa abhinn bataate hue bhaajapa ke varisht netaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha ki pakistan ke netaaon dwaara aise bhadakau bayaan dena unki aadat ban gai he, lekin bharat ke suraksha bal purv kii tarah apni bhoomi kii raksha karne or pakistan ko munhtod jawaab dene main sakasham hai
 Apart from this, the Congress has also condemned this remark of Bilawal
 congress netaa shakeel ahamed ne kaha, 'vah yuva hai, unki 70 pustein kashmir par kabja karne kaa sapana dekhati rahi hai
 They will have to wait for 70 more generations
 unhen bharat kii kshamta kaa andaja nahin
 ' punjab ke multan kshetra main kal party kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue pakistan kii agali peedi ke netaa bilaval ne kaha tha ki unki pakistan pipuls party samooche kashmir ko bharat se waapas le legi
 He said, 'I will bring Kashmir back, the whole, and i will not leave even an inch of land because like other provinces it belongs to Pakistan
 ' bilaval ne jab yah tippanee kii tab purv pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani or raja parvej ashraf unke agal bagal main the
 Bilawal has announced to contest the general election to be held in 2018
 vah dharmanirpeksh pipipi kaa netritv karenge jo aadhikarik rup se bharat ke saath achche sambandh chaahati he

 With the end of the assembly elections in five states including UP, Team Anna has tried to surround the Congress with the election expenses
 team anna ke sadsy arvind kejariwal ne congress mahasachiv digvijay singh se rahul gandhi ke helicocter dauron or baaki kharch ko saarvajanik karne kii maang kii he
 Kejriwal wrote on Twitter that when Digvijay Singh asked for the account of Anna's movement, Team Anna gave all the details of the expenditure in 24 hours
 ab digvijay singh kii baari he
 Kejriwal has asked other parties to do the same
 kejariwal ne tivetor par likhaa he ki jab digvijay singh ne anna ke andolan kaa hisaab maanga tha to team anna ne 24 ghante main kharch kaa sara byora de diya tha
 Now it's Digvijay Singh's turn
 kejariwal ne baaki dalon se bhi aisa karne ko kaha he
 The BJP Parliamentary Board accepted Vasundhara Raje's resignation as the leader of the Rajasthan Party Legislature Party
 party adhyaksh rajnath singh kii adhyakshata or varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani kii upasthiti main hui board kii baithak ke baad party mahasachiv anant kumaar ne yah jaankaree di
 Determining accountability for the party's poor performance in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in Rajasthan, party president Rajnath Singh had asked him to resign immediately as the state assembly leader three months ago
 maheenon kii taal matol ke baad vasundhara ne board kii baithak se kuch ghante pehle party ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ke nivas ja kar unhen apana istipha saunpa tha
 Sources said that Vasundhara was very emotional and had tears in her eyes while submitting her resignation
 sutron ke anusaar vasandhura ne apane patr main aarope lagaaya ki unase jis tarah se istipha maanga gaya vah bahut hi apmanjanak tha
 He has also accused the central leadership of ending democracy within the party
 sutron ne yah bhi bataaya ki vasundhara ne yah sawaal bhi kiya ki jab 1952 ke pehle loksabhaa chunaav se abhi tak aam chunaavon kii party main javabdehi tay nahin kii gai to unheen ko kyon iske liye chunaa gaya
 Soon after the board accepted his resignation in the evening, Vasundhara went to meet Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the party's top leader
 bataaya jaataa he unhone apane istife main aarope lagaaya ki rajasthan kaa mukhyamantri rahete party ke kai kendriya mantriyon ne unke khilaaf kaam kiya
 She also alleged that as a woman she was also discriminated against in the party
 rajnath singh ne vasundhara ke istife ko apni naak kaa sawaal bana liya tha or apane aadesh kaa paalan karwaane ke liye unhone har tarah kaa dabaav banaaya lekin vah use taalati raheen
 On disobeying the order, he appointed senior leader m Venkaiah Naidu and later Sushma Swaraj to talk to him about his resignation
 lekin vasundhara donon main se kisi se nahin mili
 The party leadership has taken a hard stand on this behavior of Vasundhara and party sources say that due to this it is difficult to get any role at the central level in the party in the near future
 anant kumaar ne bataaya ki vasundhara kaa istipha sweekaar karne ke alaava sansadeey board kii baithak main haal hi main sampann maharashtra, haryana or arunachal pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon main party ke pradarshan kii samiksha kii gai
 For this, the in-charge of these states and the state presidents there were called to the meeting
 iske alaava baithak main in teenon rajyon main vidhayak dal kaa netaa chunane ke liye hone vaali baithkon ke liye party paryvekshakon kii niyuktiyaan bhi kii gai
 Arun Jaitley and Anant Kumar for Maharashtra, Thawar Chand Gehlot and Vijay Goyal for Haryana and Vijaya Chakraborty for Arunachal Pradesh have been made central observers from the party

 isi tarah dilli police, didie, shiksha vibhaag jaise sarkari mahakamon ke alaava dilli ke kuch bade rais logon ke buildingon ke praparty tex bakaayaa he
 However, the corporation is showing slack in recovering them

 Despite this, the corporation is set to collect property tax from about five lakh newcomers in Delhi, including some middle-class shopkeepers and lawyers, including people like Jagdish and Amar Singh

 agar i-rickshaw ko manjuuri milti he, to us model ke sabhi vaahanon ko sadakon par chalaane kii anumati di jaani chahie
 He said, we are not forcing the government, they can solve it in 10-15 days
 i-rickshaw ko sadakon par chalane dijie
 Tell the police not to disturb them
 lekin agar sarkaar jaldi hi koi samaadhaan nahin nikaalati he, to ham sadakon par sangharsh karenge, ham andolan shuru karenge

 Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati again attacked the Congress on Wednesday, saying that the 'communal forces' in the country are becoming stronger due to the Congress party's double policy
 mayawati ne buudhvaar ko ek twit main kaha, ‘congress party kii doshali niti kii vajah se hi desh main ‘sampradayik takatein' majboot ho rahi he kyonki congress party sampradayik takaton ko kamjor karne ke bajaay, iske viruddh aawaaj uthaane vaali takaton ko hi kamjor karne main lagi he
 The public should be careful
 ' mayawati kii yah naaraazgi rajasthan main basapa ke chah vidhayakon ke congress main shaamil hone ke kaaran he

 bataa den, vidhayakon ke congress main shaamil hone par mangalvaar ko basapa supremeo mayawati ne tikhi pratikriya dete huye congress ko gaiyr bharosemand or dhokheybaaj qaraar diya he tha
 Mayawati tweeted three on Tuesday morning
 unhone pehla twit kiya, ‘‘rajasthan main congress party kii sarkaar ne ek baar phir basapa ke vidhayakon ko todakar gaiyr-bharosemand evam dhokheybaaj party hone kaa pramaan diya he
 This is a betrayal of the BSP movement which has been repeated when the BSP was giving unconditional support to the Congress government from outside
 'basapa netaa ne apane duusare tivat main kaha, ‘‘congress apni katu virdohi party / sanghathanon se ladane ke bajaae har jagah un partiyon ko hi sadaa aghat pahunchane kaa kaam karti he jo unhen sahyog / samarthan dete hai
 The Congress is thus an anti-sc, ST and OBC party and has never been sincere and honest about the right to reservation of these classes
 ''mayawati ne iske baad ek anya twit kiya, ‘‘congress hameshaa hi baba sahib dow
 Bhimrao was opposed to Ambedkar and his humanitarian ideology
 isi kaaran dow
 Ambedkar had to resign as the first law minister of the country
 congress ne unhen na to kabhi loksabhaa main chunakar jane diya or na hi bharataratna se sammanit kiya

 🙏💖😊— Adnan Sami (@adnansamilive) January 1, 2016 mahanadi jal bantwaare par bhaajapa banaam bhaajapa kii jang ne chhattisgarh or odisha donon rajyon main congress ko baithe-bithaae ek bada mudda de diya he
 Elections are to be held in Chhattisgarh this year and Odisha next year
 aise main vipaksh donon rajyo main mahanadi ko 'mahamudda' banayega
 In Chhattisgarh elections to be held a few months later, the Congress has decided to make it an election issue
 chhattisgarh main netaa pratipaksh tii
 s
 singhdev ne is masale par apana rukh spasht karte hue kaha ''mahanadi vivaad chhattisgarh sarkaar kii laaparvaahee or gaiyr jimmedaari bhare ravaie kii dein he
 If the Raman Singh government here wanted it, it would not have become an issue
 kahin na kahin is ansulajhe masale kii aanch kii tapan janata ko sahani padegi
 But we will not allow Odisha even a drop of water here
 '' tii
 It is clear from the talk of S
 Singhdev that in the upcoming Chhattisgarh elections, the BJP may find this issue costly
 saath hi odisha main hone vaale chunaav ke dauraan bhi is mudde par jamkar siyasat hogi
 Singhdev says, "if the Chhattisgarh government was sensitive to its people, it would not even come until the tribunal was formed
 raman singh apni janata ke hit ke mudde ko majbootee se nahin rakh paae
 The people here have the right over the entire water of the river
 iskaa pehla upyog pine ke liye, doosraa upyog kisaanon ke liye or bache hue jal kaa upyog industry main hoga
 The Mahanadi Jalbantwara dispute is an issue that directly affects the general public and the farmers
 aise main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan yah mudda kendriya bhoomika nibhaayega
 Last week, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan publicly took a dig at Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh's statement on the Mahanadi controversy
 raman singh ne kaha tha, ham mahanadi kaa pani vartmaan main to istemaal kar hi rahe hai
 Will use more in the future
 is par pradhan ne tikhi pratikriya di
 He said, Raman Singh's statement is condemnable
 odisha bijepi unit kaa stand saafahai ki yahaan kii janata ke hiton se samjhauta nahin kiya jayega
 On the other hand, elections are to be held in Odisha next year, so BJD is talking about this issue
 agar odisha kii bhaajapa ikai is par chup rahati he to agle saal bijd bhaajapa ke khilaaf prachaar karne main is mudde kaa istemaal jorshor se karegi
 Now being the BJP leader of Odisha, Mahendra Pradhan cannot be silent on this issue
 isliye mahanadi ke pani ko lekar do rajyon main ‘bhaajapa banaan bhaajapa’ raar or tej hogi
 On the other hand, for the waters of Mahanadi, the war within the party has given the opposition a good election
 jhagada kya he?saal 2000 main madhyapradesh se alag hokar chhattisgarh nemhanadi par chah bairaj banane shuru kar die
 Before the formation of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha were ready to resolve the dispute through Joint Control Board
 lekin jab nayaa rajya bana to raman singh sarkaar ne mahanadi par bairaj banane kaa faisla lekar odisha sarkaar ko jhatka de diya
 On this, in 2016, the Odisha government demanded the creation of an Inter State Dispute Tribunal under Supreme Court Searticle 131
 march2018 main supreme court ke aadesh kaa paalan karte hue centre ne teen sadasyeey 'mahanadi water dispute tribunel' sthapit kar di
 On 6 August, the tribunal sent a notice to the five states to nominate representatives to discuss the issue with them
 april main jal sansaadhan mantralay ne is mudde par charchaa karne ke liye paanchon rajyon se pratinidhiyon ko bulaayaa to odisha main bijd ne narazgi jaahir karte hue kaha, centre aisa karke mahanadi water disputatribunel ke kaam main baadha pahunchaana chahta he
 Mahanadi will be built in the election season Mahamudbadijad has been in Odisha for the last 18 years
 aise main antiinakambinsee factor haaavee he
 The Odisha government will exacerbate the issue
 udhar raman singh sarkaar bhi anti inakambinsee ke factor se do chaar he
 In such a situation, she will also rage on this issue
 lekin sabase zyada is masale kaa phayda vipaksh uthaane kii koshish karegaa
 Chhattisgarh elections are to be held only after a few months
 netaa pratipaksh tii
 s
 singhdev kii baat se saaf he ki is baar chhattisgarh chunaav ke dauraan mahanadi ke pani par lagegi siyaasi aag
 It will be even hotter in next year's Odisha elections
 kahaan se kahaan tak mahanadichhattisgarh kii dhamtari jile se shuru hokar yah nadi odisha main pahunchati he
 The river also partly extends from Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh

 Injured Indian fast bowler Ishant Sharma is scheduled to be out for the second ODI against England on Monday, while Yuvraj Singh's decision to play will be taken before the match
 bhartiya team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ne ravivaar ko patrakaron ko bataaya ki eshanth kaa is match se baahar rahanaa tay he kyonki agar vah yahaan nahin khelte to unhe austrailia ke khilaaf nagpur main hue chauthe or antim test main lagi takhne kii chot se ubarne ke liye paanch se saat din kaa samay mil jayega
 Yuvraj, who played an unbeaten 138-run knock in the first ODI in Rajkot on Friday, destroyed the England attack but had a backache problem
 yuvaraj ke khilne ke bare main dhoni ne kaha ki is par antim faisla match se pehle hi liya jayega
 He said that Yuvraj's condition has improved a lot but we will be able to take a final decision before his match

 The Nepali parliament on Wednesday declared the old practice prohibiting entry into the house of women during menstruation a crime
 nepal ke vibhinn samudaayon main mahilaon ko masik dharm ke dauraan apavitra samajha jaataa he or kuch sudur ilaakon main unako is avadhi main ghar se dur ek jhopadi main rahane ke liye majaboor kiya jaataa he
 This practice is known as Chhaupadi
 naye kanoon main kisi mahila ko is pratha ko maanane ke liye majaboor karne vaale ko teen maah jail kii sajaa yaa 2000 rupee kaa jurmaana yaa donon kaa praavdhaan he
 Women are forced to sleep in a hut away from home during the period of menstruation called Chhau Goth
 pichley maheene isi tarah kii ek jhopadi main soi ek kishori ko saanp ne das liya or uski maut ho gai
 In 2016, two women lost their lives due to this malpractices
 desh kii sheersh adaalat ne ek dashak se bhi adhik samay pehle is kupratha par roak laga di thi, lekin desh ke kai bhaagon main yah ab bhi prachlan main bataai jaati he
 This law, passed by voice, states that during menstruation a woman cannot be excluded under Chhaupadi
 is tarah kaa utpeedan yaa chuaachhut bhari bhaavana amanviya vyavhaar mana jayega
 In Nepal, the tradition of Chhaupadi is associated with Hinduism and in this tradition women are considered untouchables during menstruation and even after having children
 is dauraan mahilaon ko ghar se nikaal diya jaataa he or bhojan chune, dharmik pratikon ko chune or jaanwaron or mardon se bhi dur rakhaa jaataa he
 Eminent Indian social worker Deep Joshi, who works for the development of rural communities, was honored with the prestigious Magsaysay Award of the year 2009
 manila main yojit ek samaaroh main joshi ke saath philippine ke vakil antonio aposa junior, thailand ke vaigyanik chrisna chrisintu, chini watershed visheshgy you jiyaaogong, myanma ke maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta kaa saav vaa or chini jal kaaryaktaa maa june ko asia ke nobel puraskaar maane jane vaale is award se nawaja gaya
 Joshi wore traditional kurta pajamas on the occasion
 unhen 50 hajaar america dollar :kareeb 24 lakh rupee: kii nagar puraskaar raashi, ek praaanpatr or ek padak se sammanit kiya gaya
 The medal features the face of the late Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay
 raiman magasaysay award foundation ke board of trustees ne prashasti main kaha he ki joshi ko gramin samudaayon ke rupantarkari vikaas main dil or dimag kaa prabhavi taur par samanvay karke bharat main enjio andolan main vyavsaayikta laane main unke drushtikon or netritv ke liye sammanit kiya gaya he
 62-year-old Joshi, who holds a master's degree in engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a master's in management from mit's Sloan School, has more than 30 years of experience in the field of rural development and lifestyle promotion
 un barason main jab ve bihar kii ''pratinidhi'' mukhyamantri hua karti thim, jiske liye ve apane vivaah praaanpatr kii abhaari thim, rabari devi ko kam baat karne or usase bhi kam kaam karne ke liye pahachaanaa jaataa tha, donon hi kaam puri tarah se unke pati ke haathon main the-yani patna se chalane vaali satta kii asal bagdor lalu prasad ke haathon main thi
 But after the loss of power, she has not only spoken loudly but has also taken over the leadership
 ve donon main hi khaasi angadh najar aati hai
 She may not have heard of Dale Carnegie, nor will she be familiar with the familiar techniques of speech
 yahi nahin, ve bhaashan kii blue book kii har baat kaa thik ulataa karti hai-jaise bhaashan pehle se taiyaar nahin karnaa or bole gaye shabdon ke prayog par dhyaan nahin dena, or usase bhi adhik rajnatik rup se sahi vyakaran kaa dhyaan na rakhana
 She says, "I speak what my heart says
" ''sargharmiyon se bhare in loksabhaa chunaavon ke bich, rabari devi kii apni pratidwandviyon par kadavaahat bhari tippaniyon ne rajg ke netaaon ke gusse ko bhadkaa diya he
 Critical attacks on the Nitish Kumar government and eye-catching speeches with people gathered at public meetings have made Bihar's opposition leader into the most heard celebrity in Bihar and Jharkhand
 apane virodhiyon par shabdon ke tikhe tiron ne unhen surkhiyon main laa diya he
 And its effect is also being seen - Bihar Janata Dal United President Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh has filed a criminal defamation case against him
 nitish ne paaya ki is baat ko or adhik hawa di ja sakati he or unhone kaha ki agar rabari mukhyamantri ko gaali de sakati hai, to kalpana kiijie, rajd ke satta main aane ke baad ve aam janata ke saath kya karengi
 So, has Rabri Devi succeeded in diverting the attention of the NDA through her bitter propaganda? Are they really a threat to the plans of Bihar NDA? In fact, they have succeeded in getting the NDA leaders to think about them and devise a response to their controversial campaign
 or is hakeekat ko bhi koi nahin jhuthla saktaa ki rabari or unke pati lalu prasad yadav badi mushkil kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 While Nitish is on the seventh heaven with good governance credibility of his government and BJP is behind him with his strong alliance, the Congress is preparing to bring some secular votes to its fold by including the party's rebels
 lekin chunautiyaan or bhi hai
 Many analysts believe that Rabri can be a good saleswoman, but promoting RJD-LJP is like selling a bad product
 lekin rabari is aalochana se vichlit nahin dikhin
 Needing an answer, she asks, "yes, i cook in the kitchen
 main apane pati or bacchon kii dekhbhaal karti hum
 What are women for? But, does this not mean that we should be locked up at home, as Modi ji wants from me? Women are not animals, what are they? "the crowd loudly disagrees, while most of the women present at the public meeting say -" Not at all, not at all
 '' dhul bhari tej lu ke bich haath hilaate hue rabari garjana karti hai, ''to phir bhaajapa ko sabak sikhaao
 "his reference was to the suggestion of Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi in which he advised Rabri to be confined to the kitchen
" saaf he rabari ke nitish par nijee hamale ke evaj main modi ne un par jo hamalaa kiya use unhone gaiyr prabhavi kar diya
 There is no doubt that despite the heat of the afternoon, there is a huge crowd at Rabri's public meetings
 rabari devi sadhe hue shabdon main kahati hai, ''nitish kumaar 'sushasan babu' kahlaana pasand karte hai
 But where is the change? Please tell change '' ve hameshaa hi ''laluji or gathbandhan sahyogiyon'' ke bare main purajor sandesh dene main safal rahati hai
 The caste arithmetic may appear to be in the interest of the RJD-LJP alliance, but the JD (U) -BJP alliance is stronger this time than the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, when the UPA alliance won 29 Lok Sabha seats in 2004
 jahaan tak vot pratishat kaa sawaal he to bihar main rajd netritv vaale upie gathbandhan ko 43
 35 percent (RJD 30
 67, lojpa 8
 19, and Congress 4
 49 fisadi) mat mili the jabaki rajg kaa kul mat pratishat 36
 93 percent (JD-U22)
 36 or bhaajapa 14
 57 percent)
 yahaan tak ki rajd ke kattar samarthak bhi maanate hai ki is baar itihaas ko dohraye jane kii sambhaavnaaen bahut kam hai
 If we go beyond a rough estimate of political equations, then this change in Rabri Devi has emerged in the class-based politics of Bihar
 haalanki rabari jo kuch bhi karti hai uskaa kaaran or prerana ab bhi lalu hi hai lekin unhone apana ek alag mukaam bhi bana liya lagata he
 Now, unlike Rabri Lalu's need for cooperation, she is seen as an ally
 isamen koi tajjub nahin ki rajd kii sarvaadhik vaanchit star prachaarkon kii suchi main lalu ke baad unka doosraa sthaan he
 His publicity tour is also very important because unlike Lalu, he is not a target of jealousy or hatred of anyone
 ve aam graminon ke liye badi bahan jaisi hai
 He and his appeal go beyond caste equations
 yah spasht he ki ek gruhinee in varshon main aag ugalati devi main tabdeel ho chuki he
 It is indeed a big change for a woman who had tears in her eyes when she was sworn in as Chief Minister in July 1997
 ek vah bhi samay tha jab lalu ko rabari devi ko helicopter kii khidki se haath hilaane or jansabha ke baad janata kaa haath hilaakar abhinandan karne ke liye kahana padataa tha
 He always had to face hesitation and resistance
 aaj, ve alag helicopter kaa prayog karti hai or akele prachaar karti hai
 Time has changed
 sadhu yadav ko party se nikaalane ke kadam par unke jabardast samarthan se lekar bihar main chunaav prachaar kii kaman akele thaamne se unhone ''sahib'' ko akele ramvilas paswan ke saath rahane kaa mauka diya he
 In Ujiarpur, the field becomes buzzing with the slogan "rabri Devi Zindabad" as soon as the helicopter touches the earth
 unhen maalaaen pahanaai jaati hai jinhen ve badi hi vinamrata se leti hai, saath hi unke paanvon ko chune ke liye dhakka-mukki kar rahe samarthakon ko bhi chetati rahati hai
 Soon she sits on the stage, and then gets ready for the comments she is being heard a lot these days
 yogi sarkaar main duusari baar badha bijli kaa rateaarthik sankat se jujhate kisaanon par padegi marakrushi upabhoktaaon kaa bhi badha bijli kaa rateuttar pradesh main mahangi hui bijli kii maar kisaanon par kuch zyada hi padegi
 The reason is that they have to suffer economic losses from time to time due to crop failure and now they have to buy expensive electricity
 rajya main tamaam kisaan mahange dijal kii vajah se bijli se pump set chalaakar sinchai karnaa pasand karte hai
 But on behalf of the Yogi government, the electricity charges of tube wells and pump sets have also been increased
 nae rate ke mutabik, maujuuda samay main nijee tubewel va pump set kii 150 rupee prati biechpi kii dar ko badhaakar 170 rupee kar diya gaya he
 Similarly, minimum charges have also been reduced from 150 to 160
 vahiin gramin krishi upabhoktaaon ko ab 15 pratishat adhik bill dena padegaa
 Now, a new charge fix charge of Rs 50 will also have to be paid
 duusari baar mahangi hui bijliuttar pradesh main duusari baar bijli mahangi hui he
 In the year 2017, Yogi Adityanath government changed the body elections to 12
 73 pratishat daam badhaane kaa faisla kiya tha
 Now again, the public has felt the power increase of eight to 12 percent
 nai daron ke mutabik do kilowat conection vaale upabhokta agar do sau unit bijli kaa upyog karte hai to unhen har maheene 101 rupee zyada kharch dene honge
 Electricity rates in urban areas have been increased by 12 percent
 vaidya ne kaha, "rahul gandhi kaa bhaashan likhane vaale kam samajhadaar he, unhen sangh kii jaankaree nahin he, rahul ko sangh ke bare main jaananaa he to or bauddhik logon kaa sahyog len

 In a press conference after a program of Coal India Limited, the Union Minister of State (independent Charge) for Coal and Statistical and Program Implementation, Shri Prakash Jaiswal alleged that the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, in view of Bihar elections, had given flood relief by the Gujarat government four years ago
 Has given five crores rupees given
 lekin is tarah chaar varshon tak sampradayik shaktiyon kaa daaman thaamne ke baad sirf paanch crores rupee lautaa dene bhar se nitish apane paap kaa prayaashchit nahi kar sakate
 He said that if in fact even after four years, Nitish Kumar realizes the mistake of alliance with a communal party like BJP, then he should immediately break his alliance with it

 There is excitement in the people around this painful death of husband and wife but after the anger of the police, the situation has been controlled but after the incident the question arises that when will the speed of school buses in Gurugram finally stop 
 yah ghatana guruvar ko subah kareeb 7:00 baje kii he

 railway ne kam duuri kaa safar karne waalon ko mangalvaar shaam dhalate hi jhatka diya
 Ministry of Railways has decided to increase the minimum fare of trains from Rs 5 to Rs 10
 kiraaye main yah badhotaree general tikat par hui he
 That is, now the ticket of General's minimum five rupees will be available for Rs 10
 faisla 20 november se prabhavi hoga
 This increase in fares will only apply to non-suburban services
 local trainon ke kiraaye par iskaa koi asar nahin padegaa
 Increased fare 1 for two reasons
 darasal, rail mantralay ne yah faisla isliye liya taaki train ke nunatam tikat kii keemat plateform tikat ke baraabar laai ja sake
 In the same year, in the Railway Budget, platform tickets were increased from five rupees to 10 rupees
 2
 The second reason behind the increase in minimum fares is that many people used to buy the train ticket for five rupees only to go on the platform
 isse tikat kharidne ke liye line main lage yatriyon ko pareshaani hoti thi
 Railway management will also help Railway officials said that this decision will reduce congestion on the platform, which will also reduce the hassle for passengers
 railway adhikariyon ne ummid jataai he ki isse plateform prabandhan main bhi madad milegi

 Social activist Arvind Kejriwal claimed that Robert Vadra has not answered the questions asked about his relationship with DLF
 kejariwal ne is babat dlef kii safai ko aadha sach or jhootha qaraar diya
 Allegations made by Kejriwal for cheap popularity: Robert Vadravadra has alleged that Kejriwal and Prashant Bhushan are defaming him and his family for cheap popularity

 kendriya cabinet ne garib savarnon ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan kaa faisla kar siyaasi shigupha chhod diya he
 For this, the government is bringing a constitutional amendment bill on Tuesday
 lekin siyaasi rup se tufaan machaane vaale is vidheyak kii umr mahaj kuch maheene hi rahegi isaki ashanka cabinet faisle ke turant baad hi prakat hone lagi he
 People familiar with parliamentary matters say that there should be a system in the House for the Constitution Amendment Bill
 arthath sadan main shanti rahe or shor-sharaaba nahin ho
 Apart from this, two-thirds of the number of members (543) in the house are present and support is mandatory
 yadi aisa nahin he to phir vidheyak paas nahin hoga
 Sources say that many constituents of NDA and some other parties can also stall this Constitution Amendment Bill by creating noise in the House
 yadi kisi tarah se yah vidheyak yahaan se paas ho jaataa he to phir rajya sabha main isamen adnga laganaa lagbhag tay he kyonki sarkaar ko rajyasabha main bahumat nahin he
 If the bill gets stuck in the Rajya Sabha for some reason, then with the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha, the bill will end
 kai vipakshi saansadon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar yah vidheyak sirf siyaasi laabh ke liye laa rahi he
 Although it is difficult for any party to directly oppose the bill, but if it comes to the Rajya Sabha by passing the Lok Sabha, then the opposition parties can stall the bill by seeking amendment there
 chunki sarkaar ne 10 fisadi aarakshan kii baat kii he aise main jo dal ise atkana chahenge vah aarakshan 10 fisadi se badhaane yaa phir aay seemaa main katautee kii maang kar bill ko paas nahin hone denge
 Overall, the life of this bill is only till the 16th Lok Sabha

 But i was proved completely wrong

 At the same time, the issue of construction of another Jagannath temple by ISKCON on the beach at Puri in Odisha had also caught fire
 jagannatha bhakton main is baat ko lekar gussa tha ki isckon apane is mandir ko kathith rup se puri ke jagannatha mandir ke vikalp ke taur par pesh karne kii sajeesh kar rahaa he
 It was clear that the next few days of this institution, established in New York, USA in 1966, with the stated aim of spreading the message of Krishna to the world would be difficult
 puri-konark vikaas praadhikaran ke upaadhyaksh or puri ke jiladhikari arvind agarwal ne nirmaan par turant roak laga di
 Hearing the ISKCON petition filed in protest against this, the Odisha High Court stayed the authority's decision
 is par ab 17 farvari ko sunwaayee hogi
 In fact, ISKCON had approved the building plan by misleading the authority or, say, collusion with its employees
 asal building plan main jagannatha mandir kii yojana kaa koi zikr hi nahin tha
 On the distribution of colored brochures from ISKCON, it was revealed that it was clearly written that it will be an important destination for the devotees, where Mahaprabhu Jagannath, Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra will have their deities
 gaur talab he ki odisha ke hi baleshwar shahar ke paas balgopalpur main isckon kaa ek mandir ban kar taiyaar he, jo puri ke jagannatha mandir kii anukriti he
 With the help of Emami Group, about Rs 17 crore spread over three acres

 Its design has been designed by the famous architect and sculptor Raghunath Mahapatra
 or udhar uttar pradesh main krishna kii leelasthali vrundavan main isckon desh kaa sabase ooncha 70 manjila or yahi koi 700 foot ooncha mandir bana rahaa he
 An infinite installation of this temple took place in November 2014 in the presence of President Pranab Mukherjee
 iske 2020 tak puraa hone kii ummid he
 But the talk of the second Jagannath temple in Puri gave rise to a section of Jagannath devotees
 is samay prayag main maujuud puri peeth ke shankaracharya swami nishchalanand ne bhi india today ke sampark karne par kaha ki ''jab puri main ek bada jagannatha mandir maujuud he to isckon kii ore se usee tarah kaa ek or mandir banaae jane kaa auchity kya he? is bare main mujhase koi salaah-mantranaa nahin kii gai
 The entry of non-hindus into the Mahaprabhu Jagannath temple in Puri is banned
 odisha ke rajyapal essi jameer aaj tak vahaan nahin ja sake hai
 Shhre Rama, a flock of foreigners associated with ISKCON, dholak majira, walks through the gates of the shrine to sing hymns to Hare Krishna but never gets entry
 isckon se jude shwet vastra or vaishnavi tilkadhari videshi bhakt puri main aapako rojaanaa kirthan karte dikh jaaenge
 Is the new temple to be built with these in mind? Vanmali Das, the director of this ISKCON project, says this much, "ISKCON will build a temple like Jagannath temple, such thing is not in the building plan
 maamla hycourt me he
 Construction will take place according to the building plan if conditions are favorable
 ''is maamle main purv mantri varisht bijepi netaa vijay mahapaatr ke alaava shrijagannatha sena or jagannatha samskruti suraksha jaise sanghathanon ne morcha sambhala

 The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development sought clarification from the District Magistrate on the proposed construction at Mouza Sipasurubil, a beach in Puri Sadar
 jiladhikari ne report main kaha ki isckon ke project nideshak vanamali das ne isckon ke teen manjila institutional complex ke liye aktubar 2012 main arji di thi
 He brought a No Objection Certificate from the sources of water supply and pollution etc
 for construction on three plots and submitted it to the authority office in February 2013
 isi aadhaar par nirmaan kii ijaajat di gai
 The report clearly states that there was no mention of construction of Jagannath temple in the application
 agarwal india today ko bataaya, ''isckon ke building plan or unke baante gaye broshar ke byore main fark he
 Approval has been given only for the religious institution premises while in the brochure ISKCON has asked to build a temple like Jagannath temple
 shikayaton kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 The people of ISKCON are deeply distressed by this controversy
 is sanstha ke bharat main 110 kendron samet duniya main 550 centre hai
 It has propagated Vedic education in the world by getting texts translated in 81 languages like Gita, Bhagavata Purana, Isopanishad etc
 sanstha ke rashtriya sanchaar upaadhyaksh yudhisthir govind das spasht karte hai ki shshpuri kaa isckon mandir jagannatha kaa nahin balki isckon ke duusare mandiron kii tarah radha-krishna kaa bananaa he
 Its peak will also be only 30 feet, 60 percent smaller than the temple of Puri
 ''dharmantaran or paisa videsh le jane ke aaropon kaa kya? ve kehete hai ki ''assam, chhattisgarh, tripura, bengal aadi main isckon ke darjan se zyada centre hai

 Shocking Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Geelani in crisis, the Supreme Court rejected his appeal and asked him to appear before the court on February 13 in clear terms
 raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ke khilaaf rishwatakhori ke maamalon ko phir se kholane ke adaalat ke aadesh kii anupaalna nahin karne ke liye gilaani par aarope tay kiye jaaenge
 Gilani's lawyer Etazaz Ahsan told reporters outside the court that our appeal was rejected

 Inshallah, the Prime Minister will appear in court on 13 February

 An eight-member bench headed by Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary dismissed the appeal as soon as the prime minister's lawyer completed the cross-examination
 ahasan ne doharaaya ki jaradaari ke khilaaf maamalon ko phir se nahin kholkar gilaani ne kuch bhi galat nahin kiya tha kyonki raashtrapati ko desh or videsh main mukadmaa chalaae jane se chhot praapt he
 Gilani, 59, will now have to appear before another seven-member bench to face contempt charges on 13 February
 un par aarope he ki unhone jaradaari ke khilaaf maamalon ko phir se kholane ke liye swiss sarkaar ko patr likhane ke supreme court ke aadesh kii avhelnaa kii
 Earlier on February 19, the Prime Minister, appearing before the court, had argued that the President was exempted and therefore the cases against him could not be reopened
 aarope tay karne ke liye supreme court kii peeth ne unhen do farvari ko saman kiya tha
 If Gilani is found guilty of contempt of court, he could be sentenced to six months in prison and may be barred from assuming any public office
 ahasan ne guuruuvaar ko chah ghante tak chali adalati kaarywahi main pradhanmantri kaa bachaav kiya tha
 He resumed his argument, saying that Gilani acted only on the advice of legal advisors but the Chief Justice said that Ahsan should clearly tell the Prime Minister that he would have to act on court orders
 jab ahasan ne pradhanmantri se salaah mashvire ke liye 10-15 din kaa samay maanga to peeth ne kaha ki vah unhen das minute degi
 Shortly thereafter, the bench gave a brief order dismissing Gilani's appeal
