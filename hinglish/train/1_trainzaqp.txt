 Akram said that Pakistan showed maturity in the first match under pressure conditions
 pakistan ne yah match paanch wicket se jeeta tha

 akram ne kaha, mohammad hafeez or shoeb malik ne jis tarah ballebaaji kii, usase pataa chalata he ki pakistani team ke liye anbhavi khilaadi kitne mahatvapurn hai
 i am in favor of adding young players and new faces to the team, but a mix of youth and experience is necessary rather than bypassing seniors
 akram ne kaha, main uske (mohammad irfan ke) pradarshan se bahut prabhavit hua
 He bowled at 142 to 144 kmph and also maintained a good offensive line
 yadi vah isi tarah gendbaaji karnaa jari rakhata he or aage sudhaar bhi karata he to phir duniya ke chotii ke ballebaajon ke liye bhi use khelnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Irfan returns to the national team after two years

 ) In the Lok Sabha elections, BJP and NDA have registered a historic victory
 desh ke number van news channel ajtak ke Exit Poll ne bhi baaji maari he
 Till date - Axis My India had conducted the country's largest exit poll
 isamen 7 lakh 42 hajaar se zyada matadaataaon se unki raay lee gai thi
 More than 95 percent of the estimates were converted into results
 sirf seat hi nahin, balki voting percent bhi rigelt ke bilkul kareeb rahaa
 In seats where the exit poll predicted tuff fight, the margin of victory was also very low
 ajtak ke agsit pole main bijepi ko 2014 se bhi zyada siten milane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 This is exactly what happened
 bijepi ko 300 se bhi adhik siton par jeet darj karne main kaamyaab rahi
 Seats were estimated to be 339 to 365, in the exit poll of more than 350 leading Axis My India NDA was projected to get 339 to 365 seats and UPA was given 99 to 108 seats
 ab final nattejey ne ajtak ke agsit pole par muhar laga di he
 By 12 noon on the 23rd, the NDA was leading in 348 seats and UPA in 94 seats
 jabaki anya ke khate main 100 siten jaati dikh rahi hai
 In UP, the SP-BSP-RLD alliance in Uttar Pradesh was projected to get 10 to 16 seats, while BJP and others were projected to get more than 59 seats in the exit polls of up-axis My India
 ab parinaam main bijepi gathbandhan ko upi main 64 siten, mahagathbandhan ko 10 siten or congress ko mahaj 1 seat mili he
 That is, Aaj Tak's exit poll in UP also matched the final results
 voting percent tak kaa sahi niklaandajamaidit Poll main upi main bijepi ko 48 fisadi, congress ko 8 fisadi or mahagathbandhan ko 39 fisadi vot milane kii ummid jataai gai thi
 It came very close to the end result
 49
 6 per cent voted in favor of BJP
 vahiin congress ko 6
 Got 3% votes
 mahagathbandhan ko 39 fisadi ke kareeb hi vot mili hai
 Exit Poll of Bihar is also 100% correct, Bihar's exit poll was also 100% correct in terms of final result
 agsit pole main NDA ko yahaan 38 se 40 siton kaa anumaan tha
 The same thing happened
 yahaan is baar argedy kaa puri tarah supada saaf ho gaya
 The Congress has won the only Kishanganj seat
 congress ko 0 se 2 seat milane kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya tha
 In Bengal, the BJP had 19–23 seats, not an estimate
 In the exit poll, TMC was projected to face a tough fight with the BJP inside West Bengal
 ajtak ne agsit pole main tiemasi ko 19-22 siten or bijepi ko 19-23 siten milane kaa anumaan lagaaya tha
 Many people were not convinced on this graph
 lekin final nateezon ne ajtak ke agsit pole par muhar laga di
 The most accurate Exit Polls of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh not only in UP and Bengal, Aaj Tak's exit polls have proved to be accurate in every big and small state
 phir chaahe wo madhya pradesh main bijepi ko 26-28 siten or congress ko 1 se 3 siten milane kaa anumaan ho, yaa chhattisgarh main bijepi ko 7 se 8 or congress ko 3 se 4 siten milane ke sanket hon, yaa phir rajasthan kii 25 kii 25 siton par bijepi kaa danka bajane kaa anumaan ho
 In Delhi, Uttarakhand and Himachal also, BJP had a clean sweep in exit polls on 7 seats of clean sweepdilly, 4 seats of Himachal and five seats of Uttarakhand
 in teenon rajyon main agsit pole 100 fisadi sahi sabit hue
 The BJP won all the seats in the three states
 maharashtra or gujarat main clin sweep kaa tha Exit Pollegjita pole main maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena ko 38 se 42 siten, gujarat main bijepi ko 26 main se 25 yaa 26 siten kaa milane kaa anumaan lagaaya tha
 The result has also been close to the exit poll
 jab ajtak exis maai india kaa agsit pole saamne aayaa to kuch aalochakon ne ise khaarij kar diya
 Some reported an unreliable figure, and some reported paid exit polls
 lekin ab jab parinaam or agsit pole bilkul aasapaas he to phir desh kii janata kaa ajtak exis maai india par vishwaas pragadh hua he
 Pradeep Gupta, who conducted the survey, said - the exact question is the secret to success Pradeep Gupta, CMD of My India, says that the training we give to ask the exact questions in the survey is a major part of our success
 survey ko anjaam dene ke liye 500 se zyada log field main kaam karte hai
 This is a big power we have
 agar survey main koi galati hoti he to use dur karne kii turant koshish karte hai
 What was the exit poll of other institutes, the exit poll of Axis My India has been more accurate this time than other media institutions
 news18-ipsos ke agsit pole main NDA ko 336 siten, upie ko 82 or anya ko 124 siten milane kaa anumaan lagaaya tha
 While the exit poll of News 24 and Today Chanakya has been almost close to the result, News 24 Today Chanakya had projected 350 seats for NDA, 95 for UPA and 97 seats for others
 iske alaava republic-c Voter ne endie ko 287, upie ko 128 or anya ko 127 siten milane kaa anumaan lagaaya tha
 In its exit poll, Times now-vmr had given 306 seats to NDA, 132 to UPA and 104 to others
 ABP-AC Nielsen ke agsit pole main endie ko 277, upie ko 130 or anya ko 135 siten milane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 Whereas India TV-CNX in its exit poll gave 300 seats to NDA, 120 to UPA and 122 to others
 modi ke jaadu kaa tha anumaanexis maai india ke CMD pradeep gupta kaa kahana he ki uttar pradesh main jo nattejey aae hai, wo mahagathbandhan kii ummiido par bilkul khare nahin utarate
 But the exit poll estimates of 'aaj Tak' have proved to be sixteen
 pradeep gupta kii maane to ajtak exis maai india ke agsit pole main piem modi ke jis jaadu kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 The same magic of Modi has once again passed on the country
 is lihaaj se ye ajtak ke agsit pole kii bhi jeet he, jo ajtak ke karodon darshakon ke bharose kaa pratik he
 Political analysts were not even hopeful that the 'ajatak' guesses in the exit poll completely matched the final results, which is proof that the country's number one news channel is also the best in conducting a reliable exit poll
 
 darasal, jab bade-bade raajnneetik vishleshkon ko ummid nahin thi ki bhartiya janata party dobaaraa itane prachand bahumat se satta main vaapasi karegi, tab 'ajtak' ne hi apane agsit pole main modi lahar kaa anumaan lagaaya tha or vipaksh ko ek baar phir se aundhe munh girane kaa andeshaa jataayaa tha

 The US also retained its dominance in the playground by winning 121 medals
 britain ko kul 67 or china ko 70 medal praapt hue
 At the same time, only 2 medals came in the part of India among all these
 is baat ko lekar desh main jahaan ek taraf santosh he ki sakshi malik or pivi sindhu ne kam se kam bharat kii jholii khaali nahin rahane di, vahiin is baat ko lekar asantosh bhi he ki kya sava sau karod kii jansankhya vaala yah desh sirf do hi medal diserv karata he? koi khilaadiyon ko kos rahaa he to kuch mantri ji ke peeche pade hai
 Actually, this is not the time to abuse the minister or the players, but to correct their mistakes
 raaton raat olympic medal kaa sapana puraa nahin ho saktaa, iske liye ek nahin, kai chizon ko sahi karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 1
 khel prashasan main vyaapt bhrashtachar ko mitaane kii jaruratbharat main khel or khilaadiyon kaa khyaal rakhane ke liye ek alag mantralay he
 The Sports Authority of India is working to promote sports
 khel mantralay ko har saal hajaaron karod kaa bajet aavantit kiya jaataa he
 The question arises that where are these money spent? Is that money also at the right place? Seeing the number of medals in this Olympics, it does not seem so! It is not that this problem is today
 isse pehle bhi jitani sarkarein rahi hai, kisi ne sports ko koi khaas tarjeeh nahin di
 So how can you expect this country to play anything other than cricket
 kai baar alag-alag associations main bhrashtachar kii bu ai
 Did our Sports Ministry take action on that? Did you learn from him? Was the task of the Ministry of Sports entrusted to a person who knows about sports? The answer to most questions is probably no

 The need to increase sports budget, training, coaching and nutrition should be taken care of by the government
 The fact is that even today almost half of India is malnourished
 aadhi se adhik jansankhya aisi he jise shuddh or neutricious khaanaa mayssar nahin he
 Our physics is weak compared to US, UK, Australia, China and we are not able to compete with them
 isaki vajah yah he ki hamaare desh main athleates ke paas itane paise nahin hai ki wo proper diet plan ko follow kar paaen
 In such a situation, it is the responsibility of the government to increase the sports budget, so that the responsibility of taking food from national level players to training can be taken
 bajet badhane se khilaadiyon kii facilities ko behatar kiya ja saktaa he
 International level coaches can be hired under the supervision of our athletes
 3
 The Sports Authority of India will have to wake up from sleep - when the Olympics or a big event comes, then our associates sleep
 phir afratfari or aanan-fanan main athleates kii talash shuru ho jaati he
 After two poor performances in the Olympics, the Sports Authority of India again falls asleep in Kumbhakarna
 darasal is dhilaai ko dur karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 If India has to do something good in the world of sports, it is necessary to develop sports culture in the country
 iske liye khel mantralay ko sports athurity of india par kadi najar rakhni hogi ki kya rashtriya, rajya or jila str par khilaadiyon ke liye makul intjaam kiye ja rahe hai? kya nichle str par khilaadiyon tak suvidhaayen pahunch rahi hai? kaam sirf asi kamaron main baithkar nahin hoga, pratibhaaon ko aage laane ke liye gaavon or chote shaharon tak pahunch banani hogi

 skool or college str par sports ko tarjeeh deni hogiaj ke samay main khel bhi kariyar banane kaa ek bahut bada mauka ban chukaa he
 There was a time when national level big players used to come out of colleges, but today that tradition is almost seen to end
 skool or collejon main sports ke prati chaatro ko protsaahit karnaa hoga
 In most schools nowadays, only cricket is considered sports, this thinking needs to be changed
 skool or college wo platform he jahaan se antarrashtriya str ke star kii talash ko puri kii ja sakati he
 Cricket, football, hockey and tennis will be promoted in schools and colleges as well as other events such as athletics, wrestling, shooting, swimming, gymnastics and track and field
 iske liye har skool main specialist sports ajukeshan teacher ke appointment kii aavashyaktaa he
 5
 sab kuch sarkaar par nahin chhod sakate, sports ko bananaa hoga jivan kaa ahm hissaahamaare hindustan kii ajeeb vidambnaa he ki yahaan ek middle class family bhi apane kaam khud se karne main apni tauheen samajhataa he
 If someone needs a glass of water, they will bring their servant
 wo khud shaareerik mehnat nahin kar saktaa
 This mentality needs to change
 yah baat bilkul sach he ki har insaan bharat ke liye nahin khel saktaa, lekin kya khud ko feet rakhane main koi buraai he? agar har shaks sirf apni fitness ke liye hi khelon ko apane dincharya kaa hissaa bana le to aane vaali peedi khud majboot or swasth ho jaaegi
 Developing sports culture to change the bad condition of sports is the demand of today's time
 saath hi saath swayamsevi sanghathan or anya samjik sanghathanon ko khel ke prati yuvaaon kii ruchi jagaane ke liye nichle str par jaagrukta failaani hogi
 Small contests have to be organized in villages, towns and cities
 facilities or pahchaan kaa abhaav hone ke baad bhi rio olympic main kai khilaadi gumnaam gaanv yaa chote shahar se aae
 It is said that change does not come overnight
 iske liye saalon saal mehnat kii jarurat hoti he
 If governments, associations, institutions and we work hard together today, perhaps the fortunes of Indian sports will change in the coming few years
 bharat main ek badi mashhoor kahawat he 'padhoge likhoge banoge nawab, kheloge kudoge banoge karaab', sakshi malik or pivi sindhu par karodon kii dhan varsha ne is baat ko betuka sabit kar diya he

 After that, the police also stunned the secret

 Union Minister Charandas Mahanta wrote letters to the Prime Minister, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in a hurry
 iske baad puraatatv vibhaag kii team chheni-kudaal lekar dondia kheda pahunch gai thi
 People from far and wide had gathered to watch the spectacle in Daundia Kheda and the temporary food and drink shops created a fair atmosphere

 An answer will also have to be given to the central government, because now the charges of superstition will be intensified
 chunki narendra modi pehle hi khudaai par sawaal uthaa chuke hai, to ho saktaa he ki khajaane ke bahaane bijepi suniyojit rup se congress ko nishane par le
 However, the chapter of Daundia Kheda is closed forever
 1857 ke hathiyaar bhi nahin mili hai
 There is just one story left, which you will be able to tell while enjoying the next generation

 With this, the case of the new Congress leader in the Lok Sabha also got entangled on the party's command in Madhya Pradesh
 aakhir donon kii praathamikta madhya pradesh kaa mukhyamantri kii rahi he
 In such a situation, some important facts have emerged after several rounds of meetings
 
 
 1
 Kamal Nath has almost the last chance in terms of age, and despite all the efforts, he has never been made a CM face before now
 2
 Kamal Nath MP can include leaders like Digvijay Singh, Kantilal Bhuria, Arjun Singh's son Ajay Singh and Suresh Pachauri, who is also senior to all other leaders like Scindia
 3
 In the last election, only for the last time, but Scindia was contested only by presenting him as CM face, when he was made the chairman of the campaign committee
 4
 Scindia, who is with Rahul in the Lok Sabha, may be better at the moment
 lekin doosraa paksh ye he ki kamalnath ke paas loksabhaa kaa zyaada anubhav he
 Which can help and benefit Rahul in the Lok Sabha
 aise main taiyaar formule ke mutabik, sindhiya kaa khadge kii jagah loksabhaa main congress kaa netaa bananaa kaaphi sambhav nazar aa rahaa he
 In this case, Kamal Nathka is also expected to take charge of Madhya Pradesh Congress
 sutron ke mutabik, sab kuch thik rahaa to jaldi hi is bare main faisla ho jayega
 In such a situation, if Rahul does not veto, then Sonia and all the big leaders Kamal Nath are right to make Madhya Pradesh's command and Scindia the leader of the party in the Lok Sabha
 lekin kul milakar ye to tay he ki party ke in do bade padon par madhya pradesh ke inhen do netaaon kii niyukti honi he, ek dilli main, to ek empi main
 By the way, Rahul does not want to be the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 kyonki unako party kaa adhyaksh bananaa he or rahul nahin chaahate ki ek netaa ek pad kaa siddhant khud rahul toden
 By the way, history is witness that when Sonia entered politics, she made Sharad Pawar the leader of Congress in Lok Sabha
 haalanki, tab loksabhaa main congress ke netaa ko vipaksh ke netaa taur par cabinet ministar kaa darja praapt tha

 He said- "ravi was talking about Bhishyash for the last time
 jab ham uske jakhmon kii dressing kar rahe the to ravi ne poocha kya yash mujhase milane aaenge?'' Rape is a dark word
 Let’s not water it down to describe a brutal gym session or a bad day at work or with a joke
 @ jimsarbh # kanganaranaut have some sense before cracking such jokes !! Kangs is a + grade hypocrite (nothing new) and this Jim Sarbh turned out to be a piece of shit
 Rape jokes are not okay

 Dear Jim Sarbh / Kangana Ranaut Rape jokes are not funny
 Rape is NOT a joke
 If you tell or laugh at jokes about rape you are a part of the problem

 co / pk5bsb9zcr Unknown people threw petrol bombs outside the theater to protest against the film Padmavat in Maharashtra
 haalanki, isse kisi prakaar ke nuksaan kii khabar nahin he
 In fact, unknown mischievous elements threw petrol bombs on Saturday night outside a cinema theater showing 'padmavat' in Kalyan in Thane district of Maharashtra
 kalyaan police ne bataaya ki ghatana main kisi ke jakhmi hone kii koi soochna nahin he
 The incident took place outside Bhanu Sagar Theater at 9
10 pm
 unhone bataaya ki jaanch ke liye police kii ek team vahaan pahunchi he
 Sanjay Leela Bhansali-directed 'padmavat' has been on the target of Rajput organizations since its creation
 ve film ke jariye itihaas se chhedchhad kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 However, the people who watch the film say that it has not shown any such scene which hurt the Rajputs
 idhar, karani sena ne shanivaar ko kaha ki yadi use ‘padmavat’ film ke adhikaar saunp die jaaen to vah is film ko banane par hue kharch kaa bhugtan karne ko taiyaar he
 At the same time, he categorically denied having had his hand in the violent incidents in the country upon the release of this film
 karani sena ke pramukh lokentre singh kalvi ne kaha ki unke sadasyon yaa kisi bhi anya kshatriya sanghathan kaa skool bas par hue hamale main koi haath nahin he
 Let me tell you that on Wednesday, a school bus carrying 20-25 children was attacked by a mob in Gurgaon
 film ke virodh main hinsak pradarshnakariyon ne vaahanon main aag laga di or saarvajanik sampatti ko nuksaan pahunchaaya
 Kalviene said that the members of his organization have nothing to do with the violence in Ahmedabad
 ahmedabad main maalon ke baahar vaahanon main todphod kii gai thi
 He said that people associated with the film are behind these attacks
 unhone kaha, ‘yadi vah (bhansaali) film kaa adhikaar hamen saunp dete hai to ham paisa ikattha kar unhen dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 We will (burn) the reels of the film
 ’ Although there is already a trend of giving lakhs of rupees to artists in the folk songs of Gujarat, but such pictures coming after demonetisation surprise people
 sawaal yah he ki jab gramin ilaakon main logon ko saptaah ke chaar hajaar rupee nikaalane ke liye ghanton linon main laganaa pad rahaa he tab kalakaaron par udaane ke liye itane note kahaan se aa rahe hai? kuch lakh rupayon ke note milane par iskar poochtacha bhi karata he, tab aisi ghatnaayen kaise jari hai? Banks' atms are still closed and millions of currency notes are being flown to artists in social gatherings
 sawaal yah hi uthta he ki kya itani rakam udaane kii ghatana kii bhi kabhi jaanch hogi? is tarah ke jalson main udaane ke liye note aate kahaan se hai, yah bhi to jaanch kaa vishay hona chahie

 The newly elected President of the country, Ram Nath Kovind, may take his first visit to the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir after assuming office
 kovind desh ke 14wein raashtrapati honge or isi ke saath wo teenon senaaon ke supreme commander bhi ban jaaenge
 According to sources, after becoming President, Kovind can first go to Ladakh and increase the morale of the army there
 sena ke sutron ke mutabik uski ore se taiyaariyaan shuru kar di gai hai or ummid he ki jald hi kovind ke offis kii ore se hari jhandi mil jaaegi
 The Ladakh region is considered very important for India from a strategic point of view as it shares a border with China in the east and Pakistan in the west
 kovind kaa jeet ke baad ladakh janaa isliye bhi mahatvapurn he kyonki is samay china ke saath bharat ke rishte bahut achche nahin chal rahe or doklam ke mudde par sikkim rigen main donon deshon ke senaaon ke bich tanatani kaa maahaul he
 Former Bihar Governor Ramnath Kovind defeated rival candidate Meira Kumar in a one-sided contest in the results announced on July 20

 The name of music composer Anu Malikka has emerged in the wrap of # metoo
 mashhoor plabac singershweta panditne utpeedan kaa aarope lagaaya he
 She says that Anu Malik had a recording role in her recording studio when she was 15 years old
 shweta ne twitor post ke jariye apni aapbeetee share kii he
 He wrote- "this is the year 2000 when i was launched as a lead singer in the film Mohabbatein
 mujhe anu malik ke us samay rahe manager mustafa ne phone kiya tha
 i was called at the Empire Studio in Andheri
 '' # metoo: 19 saal baad thane pahunchin vinata, court se alok nath ko fatkaar''jab main or meri maa studio pahunche tab ve film aawaara pagal divaana ke liye shaan or sunidhi ke saath group song kii recording kar rahe the
 He asked me to sing a song without music
 tab maine ''har dil jo pyaar karegaa'' song gaaya
 In response to this, Anu Malik said, i will give you this song with Sunidhi and Shaan but for this you will have to kiss me now
 main shocked rah gai thi
 '' Had to go back to my worst memory as a teenage girl today to write this and speak up - its now or never

 i used to call him Anu Uncle
 ve meri puri family ko dashakon se jaanate the
 He used to call my father as brother
 kya koi apane bhai kii beti se aisi demand karata he? unki 2 jawan betiyaan hai
 That moment was the worst of my life
 main kai maheenon tak tanaav main rahi thi
 Sushant said - the elders are not happy on the tough stand, the new committee of Sinta on # metoo wrote, accusing Anu Malik, "I am sure he must have exploited many singers
" main un singrs se apil karuungi ki ve bhi anu malik ke khilaaf apni kahani share karen
 '' Shweta has thanked Singarsona Mahapatra for bringing the antics of Anu Malik

 " smriti iraniko mantri pad sanbhale sirf chah maheene hue hai, lekin unhen lekar kai vivaad uth chuke hai
 His name has been in the news in various controversies ranging from allegations of advancing the saffron party's secret agenda to the four-year undergraduate course (FYUP) of Delhi University and the german-sanskrit language in central schools
 unhone apana paksh rakhte hue associat editanubhuti vishnoior pramukh samvaadadatasantosh kumarako bataaya ki ve sirf niyamon kaa paalan kar rahi hai or shiksha par sabhi dalon kii aam sahmati kii niti par chal rahi hai
 Edited excerpts: It has been six bustling months since taking over, how has been your experience as the head of an important ministry like HRD? Overall, my journey is not just six months, but 38 years Has been done and she has been very interesting
 jab main mantralay main ai to maine sabhi se kaha ki agar aap shiksha ko kisi chunauti kii tarah lenge to sirf usase jujhate hi rah jaaenge
 If you take this as an opportunity, then you will be able to think of something new and possibly find a new way out of the old ways
 haalanki log maanate hai ki shiksha main raajnneeti hoti he, lekin alag-alag partiyon ke logon se baat karke maine paaya ki teen mukhya muddon par sabhi kii aam sahmati he
 First, all our children should get education
 doosraa, sabhi bacchon or chaatro ke liye gunvatttaparak shiksha uplabdh honi chahie
 And thirdly, the education that we get, can show us a progressive path not only to the present conditions but also to the future
 main aam sahmati ke maahaul ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi kaam karti hum
 How do you see the four-year syllabus controversy of Delhi University, which started soon after you became a minister and created a very negative image in the press
 meraa puraa dhyaan hameshaa is baat par rahaa he ki koi mudda kis tarah chaatro ko prabhavit karata he
 There were 44 courses which did not have the legal approval of the President of India
 aise course the, jinke naam niamak sanstha ujisi ne khaarij kar die the or kareeb 70,000 chaatr in corson ko pard rahe the, jabaki unhen pataa tha ki in corson kii koi kanoonee vaidhata nahin he
 So the challenge before me was whether i should start a new session knowing that the 44 courses in which 70,000 students are enrolled are not legally valid or pretend to be unknown so that the press is happy
 jo chaatr dilli vishvavidhyalay main chaar saal kii kadi mehnat karke degree hasil kare or baad main use pataa chale ki uski degree vaid nahin he to us par jo bitati, vah kahin zyada dukhadaayi hota
 The common belief is that you took a strong stand on the teaching of German as a third language in Kendriya Vidyalayas (kvs)
 
 
 ek cabinet mantri or kendriya vidhyalay sanghathan kii adhyaksh ke rup main main aise dastavej par dastakhat nahin kar sakati thi, jo samvidhan ke siddhanton kaa ulanghan karata ho
 This is a challenge that is part of my heritage
 
 
 yah bahut durbhagyapurna he ki paryaapt vichaar-vimarsh ke bina hi emoyu (kevi main german bhashaa kii padhai ke liye gothe institute ke saath) par dastakhat kar die gaye the
 Many people have alleged that they are not being allowed to teach foreign languages, which is wrong
 kendriya vidyalayon main chini, japani, french bhashaaen padhai ja rahi hai or ham kah chuke hai ki isi tarah german bhi videshi bhashaa ke taur par padhai jaani chahie
 Many people do not want to understand this and are presenting it in a wrong way
 maine sirf itnaa kaha he ki german ko bharat kii teesri bhashaa ke taur par nahin padhaayaa ja saktaa, jo vaastavik, vaidhanik or sanvaidhanik taur par sahi faisla he
 Doing this in between sessions will not make it difficult for the students? This mou was signed in such a way that its duration was ending in the middle of the session
 mere paas ek hi vikalp tha ki main yaa to agle teen saal ke liye samjhaute par dastakhat karun yaa jaan-boojhkar kanoon kaa ulanghan karun yaa satr ke bich main hi samjhaute ko khatm kar duun
 The students affected by this are from class six to eight
 inaki koi board pariksha nahin hoti he, isliye unka akalan skool main hi kiya jayega
 Firstly, it is not just about Sanskrit, any language recorded in Article 8 of the Constitution can be chosen
 hamane chaatro kii jaruraton ke alaava adhyaapan or counselling ko najar main rakhaa he
 Students who wish to study German can read it as a foreign language
 sirf yahi prakriya hamane badali he
 What to say about allegations of saffronisation in education? Your decision to start a Sanskrit week has come under severe criticism
 kisi bhartiya bhashaa ko mahatv dene par aalochana kyon? maine 22 bhashaaon main niabandh pratiyogita bhi karai
 One of the essay competitions started was on Pingali Venkaiah, a Congress leader
 hamane iske liye telegu, angreji or hindi main aavedan sweekaar kiye
 Was i criticized for prioritizing Andhra? i think that disputes are raised about me because it gets a lot of publicity
 kai sansthaaon main koi pramukh hi nahin he or unki niyuktiyaan abhi tak lambit hai
 Any appointment is made through the search and selection committees after advertising those positions
 kya main khud ko un samitiyon par thopus? main aisa nahin kar sakati
 This process has been speeded up, it takes time to complete the process
 sansthaaon main 2010 or 2011 se hi unke pramukh nahin hai
 It has been only six months since i became a minister
 maje kii baat he ki kabhi yah sawaal nahin poocha gaya ki ye sansthaaen kisi pramukh ke bina 2010-11 se kis tarah chal rahi hai
 The Human Resource Development Minister before you had prepared an agenda for large-scale reform, but he could not pass a single bill in Parliament
 aapkaa vidhaayi or sudhaar kaa agenda kya he?main sirf yahi kahuungi ki iiity vidheyak or kendriya vishvavidhyalayon main sanshodhan vidheyak par hamaari aam sahmati thi or sansad un muddon par bahut sakaaratmak rup se pratikriya de rahi he, jo sansthaaon ko majboot karne main hamaari madad karte hai
 It is very rare to see leftist parties, Congress and BJP on the same platform — and we have been successful in doing so in terms of education
 shiksha main raajnneeti nahin, rashtraniti dikh rahi he
 What is your main agenda for the next year or what is the main thrust for the field of education? Education should not be an agenda
 jab yah ek agenda ban jaati he to kai samasyaayein jud jaati hai
 My job as a minister is to provide a platform so that people can communicate with each other
 hamen bataaen ki hamaare chaatro or hamaari sansthaaon ke liye sabase acha kya he
 This is what we have done
 aarope hai ki aresas aap par apana agenda thope rahaa he
 You have held several meetings with its leaders and those with an inclination towards the RSS
 jab main (assam ke mukhyamantri tarun) gogoi, (kerala ke mukhyamantri umman) chandi, (pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri) mamata banerjee se milti hum to is bare main kuch nahin kaha jaataa kyonki isse masaaledaar khabaranhin banati
 i meet everyone, but i do the same thing that is within the limits of the Constitution
 main aresas ke logon ke saath mulaakaat ko koi aarope nahin maanati
 It is believed that a lot of work of the Ministry of Human Resource Development is not going ahead because many files are stuck
 main samajhati hum ki jo log mujhe nishaanaa banaate hai, unhen shaayad mere bare main maaloom nahin he
 It's not easy to beat me
 aap mujh par hamalaa kar sakate hai, meraa apmaan kar sakate hai, gaali de sakate hai, twitor par dhamkee de sakate hai
 
 
 But i will do what the responsibility is given to me - work by following the prescribed procedure and get the policies implemented within the scope of the law
 <vampanthi dalon, congress or bijepi ko ek hi manch par dekhnaa bahut durlabh baat he—or shiksha ke maamle main ham aisa karne main safal rahe hai
 On Thursday, the air in the capital Delhi has also been dangerous in terms of air pollution
 dilli ke pradooshan ko lagaataar maapne vaali mausam vibhaag kii agency ke taaja aankadon ke mutabik yahaan par zyaadaatar jagahon par piem 2
 Pollution of 5 has been 449 micrograms per cubic meter
 in maheen kanon kii sef limit mahaj 60 microgram hoti he
 Similarly, the level of PM 10 particles has been 564 micrograms per cubic meter
 in kanon kii sef limit 80 microgram hoti he
 So overall, the pollution of dangerous particles in the air of Delhi has been continuously recorded above the alarming level for the last seven days
 isliye rajdhani dilli main kohre kii sthiti banane se smog har jagah najar aa rahaa he
 Visibility fell to 50 meters due to fog in Safdarjung, Delhi on Thursday morning
 is sthiti ko ghaney kohre kii shrenee main rakhaa jaataa he
 During the day, the fog subsided but there was no significant impact on air pollution
 iske ulat rajdhani dilli main kai jagahon par sataha par ozon kii maatra teji se badi
 By midday, ozone gas content at Delhi University and Mathura Road was recorded to be higher than normal
 is sthiti ko alorming kaha ja saktaa he
 The reason is that even though ozone is considered good in the upper atmosphere, when it grows on the ground, when it is inhaled, it damages the lungs
 ozon kaaphi asthir gas he or ye jald hi tuutakar oxigen ke ek anu or aksigen ke ek atom main badal jaati he
 The atom of oxygen reacts very quickly and starts damaging the lungs
 is vajah se sarphase ozon kii sthiti main buudhon or bacchon ko khule main na jane kii salaah di jaati he
 The Meteorological Department says that the condition of calm air will remain in the capital Delhi till November 5 and due to this people will have to face dangerous air pollution till November 6
 maujuuda purvanumaan ke mutabik 4 or 5 november ko dilli kii hawa main piem 2
 The volume of 5 particles will remain around 380 micrograms and the volume of PM10 particles will remain in the air at the level of 503 micrograms
 is sthiti main rajdhani main logon ko abhi 72 ghanton tak jahrili hawa main saans lene ke liye majaboor hona padegaa
 According to Muzaffar Baig, senior PDP leader and MP, state Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti was not taken into confidence before Burhan Wani was killed
 ve ye bhi kehete hai ki khud police or suraksha balon kii taraf se ye daawa kiya jaataa tha ki burhan vaani ko ve jab chahen 15-20 minute main giraftaar kar sakate hai
 Baig is raising questions that if this was the case then why was he killed
 uski maut ke baad kis tarah ke halaat paidaa honge is bare main koi khufia jaankaree ikattha kyon nahin kii gai
 In fact, Baig is describing the entire case as a result of the failure of the intelligence system and the lack of management necessary to keep the situation under control
 muzaffar beg kehete hai ki burhan vaani yuvaaon main lokapriy tha to isliye nahin ki vah koi bahut bada aatankwaadi tha
 It was simply 'show Boy' (poster boy)
 vah cricket bhi kheltaa tha or internet par bahut sakriy tha
 Baig asks if action was to be taken against him, so why was not an emergency plan made
 is sawaal par ki kya jo halaat paidaa hue hai kashmir main usase pidipi ko jamini taur par nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he kyonki log sarkaar se naaraaz hai, beg kehete hai ki nuksaan pidipi ko nahin desh ko uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 The party keeps its ups and downs but the situation that has arisen at the moment has shocked the image of the country in the world
 us chhavi ko jise banane main pradhanmantri hameshaa koshish main lage rahete hai
 Baig also believes that the problem arose in Kashmir because the anti-pdp and BJP together formed the government
 ve yaad dilaate hai ki samasya 25 saalon se rahi he
 At present, the situation is not handled properly, so the valley is facing bad days
 tippaniyan Baig says that the current environment cannot be changed on the strength of strength
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke is bayaan kaa ki zyaada bal prayog nahin hona chahie, zikr kar beg kehete hai ki pradhanmantri kaa aisa kahana is baat kaa saboot he ki kashmir main zarurat se zyaada bal prayog kiya gaya
 And the use of force will not solve the problem, rather it needs to reach people in the right way
 beg kii maang he ki puure maamle kii ucchstareey jaanch karaayi jaae
 Burhan Wani to be killed and the situation that followed
 jo iske liye zimmedaar hai unako saamne laayaa janaa chahie
 If the investigation is better than a retired Supreme Court judge

 Although Baig is not convinced about Pakistan's role in peacekeeping, he will be ready for it or not, when it will happen
 lekin unka saafe maananaa he ki andruni taur par is puure maamle ko raajnneetik phaayde yaa nuksaan ke taur par nahin dekhnaa chahie

 On the question whether the PDP is suffering from the ground in Kashmir because of the situation that has arisen because people are angry with the government, Baig says that the country is suffering the loss, not the PDP
 party kaa utaar chadhaav chalata rahata he lekin philhal jo halaat paidaa hue hai usase duniya main desh kii chhavi ko dhakka laga he
 The Prime Minister is always trying to create that image
 beg is baat ko bhi galat maanate hai ki kashmir main samasya isliye paidaa hui kyonki ek duusare kii dhuravirohi pidipi or bijepi ne mil kar sarkaar banaayi
 They remind that the problem has been there for 25 years
 maujuuda vakt main halaat se thik dhang se nipta nahin gaya isliye ghati ko bure din dekhne pad rahe hai
 The comments beg kehete hai ki taaqat ke bal par maujuuda maahaul ko nahin badla ja saktaa
 Noting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement that more force should not be used, Baig says that such a statement of the Prime Minister is evidence that excessive force was used in Kashmir
 or bal prayog se samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin nikalegaa balki iske liye sahi tareeke se logon tak pahunch banane kii zarurat he
 Baig has demanded that a high-level inquiry should be conducted into the entire matter
 burhan vaani ko maare jane kii bhi or uske baad paidaa hue halaat kii bhi
 Those responsible for this should be brought to the fore
 jaanch supreme court ke ritred jaj se ho to behatar he
 Baig's second and important demand is that if the people of Kashmir want to win their hearts, the same policy that Atal Bihari Vajpayee talked about while resolving the issue while being in the realm of humanity as prime minister
 haalanki beg shanti sthapana main pakistan kii bhoomika ko lekar aashwast nahin hai, vah iske liye taiyaar hoga ki nahin, hoga to kab hoga
 But he clearly believes that internally, this entire matter should not be viewed as a political advantage or disadvantage

 beg kehete hai ki taaqat ke bal par maujuuda maahaul ko nahin badla ja saktaa
 Noting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement that more force should not be used, Baig says that such a statement of the Prime Minister is evidence that excessive force was used in Kashmir
 or bal prayog se samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin nikalegaa balki iske liye sahi tareeke se logon tak pahunch banane kii zarurat he
 Baig has demanded that a high-level inquiry should be conducted into the entire matter
 burhan vaani ko maare jane kii bhi or uske baad paidaa hue halaat kii bhi
 Those responsible for this should be brought to the fore
 jaanch supreme court ke ritred jaj se ho to behatar he
 Baig's second and important demand is that if the people of Kashmir want to win their hearts, the same policy that Atal Bihari Vajpayee talked about while resolving the issue while being in the realm of humanity as prime minister
 haalanki beg shanti sthapana main pakistan kii bhoomika ko lekar aashwast nahin hai, vah iske liye taiyaar hoga ki nahin, hoga to kab hoga
 But he clearly believes that internally, this entire matter should not be viewed as a political advantage or disadvantage
 beg kii maang he ki puure maamle kii ucchstareey jaanch karaayi jaae
 Burhan Wani to be killed and the situation that followed
 jo iske liye zimmedaar hai unako saamne laayaa janaa chahie
 If the investigation is better than a retired Supreme Court judge
 beg kii duusari or ahm maang he ki kashmir ke logon kaa dil jeetna he to jis tarah se pradhanmantri rahete atal bihari vaajapeyi ne insaaniyat ke daayre main rahete hue masale ke hal kii baat kii thi usee niti ko apanaaya jaae
 Although Baig is not convinced about Pakistan's role in peacekeeping, he will be ready for it or not, when it will happen
 lekin unka saafe maananaa he ki andruni taur par is puure maamle ko raajnneetik phaayde yaa nuksaan ke taur par nahin dekhnaa chahie

 aap is mahaan congress party ke sipaahi hai
 Last year i talked to you about the optimism and energy that makes this country
 pichley 10 saalon se hamen manmohan singh ke netritv kaa gaurav hasil tha
 During this time major changes took place in the country

 No brother, clap a little harder
 bilkul kal sonia ji ke liye bhi taalia bajaaie
 You are our power
 (angreji spich kaa anuwaad)hamane loktantr kii neenv majboot kar is desh kii seva kii he
 What did we do to increase people's strength? artiai laae
 Everyone in the world says, information is strength
 hamane ye takat logon ko di
 There was no pressure on us for this
 hamen pataa tha ki hamaari apni sarkarein nigaraanee main aaengi
 Still what? hamane aadhaar card shuru kiya, taaki aap tak sidhe paisa pahunch sake
 This is not a small thing
 rajeev gandhi ji 15 paise kii baat karte the
 We are the first government to have money directly transferred to your account
 ye puri duniya main bana sabase bada anti karpshan plateform he
 Panchayati Raj talks

 Now one cannot refuse a poor man for a job and food
 ab koi kisi bhartiya ko sawaal poochne se nahin roak paata
 This was done by the UPA and Congress in the last 10 years
 ek bhi aisa kadam nahin, jo congress ne desh kii behatari ke liye na uthaaya ho
 Whether it is to fight the British, whether the banks are nationalized
 chaahe telecom kranti ho
 We did all this
 ab hamaara lakshya he, is loktantr ko zyada se zyada logon tak pahunchaana
 There are mps here
 kuch yuva hai, kuch nahin hai
 There are legislators here

 sawaal ye nahin he ki ham badalenge yaa nahin
 The question is when and how will we change
 ek raajnneetik dal ke rup main hamen aise bade badlaav laane hai, jinhen sirf congress party hi kar sakati he
 We, like others, cannot adopt a complaining tone about every mistake
 hamen samaadhaan bananaa hoga

 darasal, pune kii tonu sojatiya ne apni puri car par shridevi kii tasviren plaster karwaai hai
 She brought the car from Pune to Mumbai to meet Boney Kapoor

 He too did not disappoint Fan at all and he met him
 ramajaan kaa pavitra maheenaa chal rahaa he
 There is a reason behind celebrating every festival
 aaie jaanate hai ramajaan ke pavitra maah kaa mahatv
 Why celebrate Ramadan? In Islam, the month of Ramadan is considered the most culinary month
 ramajaan ke maheene main quran najil hua tha
 It is believed that the doors of Jannat are opened in the month of Ramadan
 allaah rojedaar or ibaadat karne vaale kii dua kubul karata he or is pavitra maheene main gunahon se bakhshish milti he
 The importance of the month of Muslims for Muslims is even more because these days, through the Prophet Hazrat Mohammed Saheb, the important book of Allah ‘quran Sharif’ (nazil) landed on the ground
 isliye musalmaan zyaadaatar vakt ibaadat-tilavat (namaaj padhanaa or quran padhane) main gujaarte hai
 Muslims donate to the poor and needy during the month of Ramadan
 kaise rakhte hai rojaa ?rojaarakhane ke liye savere uthakar khaaya jaataa he ise sehari kehete hai
 After the sehri, they remain hungry and thirsty till the sun sets
 suraj dhalane se pehle kuch khaane yaa pine se rojaa tut jaataa he
 It is also forbidden to get angry with eating and drinking during rosé and to want someone bad
 kaise kholte hai rojaa ?shaam ko suraj dhalane par aamtaur par khajur khaakar yaa pani pikarrojakholte hai
 The opening of Rosa is called Iftar
 iftaar ke vakt sachche man se jo dua maangi jaati he wo kubul hoti he
 Who is exempt from fasting? Children, the elderly, travelers, pregnant women and in the condition of illness are exempted from fasting
 jo log rojaa nahin rakhte unhenrojedaarke saamne khaane se manaahi he
 Ramzan ends with the moon of Ramadan and Eid
 ramajaan kii khushi main id manaai jaati he
 Eid itself means 'happy day'
 musalamanonke liye id-ul-fitr tyohaar alag hi khushi lekar aata he
 Eid's moon is illuminated everywhere
 uttar pradesh main karaari haar ke baad bispi supremeo mayawati ke liye dilli ab dur kii kaudi najar aane laga he
 The performance of the BSP, which was reduced to zero in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, was also disappointing in the assembly elections
 alam ye he ki mayawati kaa rajya sabha sadsy bananaa tak mushkil lag rahaa he
 Apart from Mayawati, there is a cloud of political crisis in front of Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav
 raajnneeti bachaane ke liye akhilesh ke saamne rajya sabha sadsy banane kaa hi vikalp bachaa he
 Although he will have to wait till 2018 for this, Akhilesh Yadav is a member of the Legislative Council
 upi kii do badi partiyon ke bade netaaon ke saamne apanaaraajanneetik bhavishya bachaane kii chunauti he
 If Mayawati's party forms an alliance with the BSP, its arch-rival SP, then the path will be cleared for Mayawati to become a Rajya Sabha member, but whether it will happen or not will be quite interesting to see
 gathbandhan kaa vikledgar sapa or bispi gathbandhan kar leti hai to donon apana ek-ek sadsy rajyasabha main bhej sakati hai
 Akhilesh faces the challenge of becoming a leader of the opposition besides becoming a member of the Rajya Sabha
 ajam khan or shivpal yadav ko bhi is baar jeet hasil hui he to ho saktaa he inamen se hi kisi ek ko upi vidhansabha main vipaksh kaa netaa banaaya jaae
 Let me tell you that Mayawati became a member of Rajya Sabha after she lost the assembly elections from SP in 2012 because at that time the BSP had 87 mlas in her account, but this time she has got only 19 seats in the court, due to which she is difficult to become a member of the Rajya Sabha
 The BSP does not have enough mlas to become a Rajya Sabha member according to college provision
 antarrashtriya cricket parishad ke mukhya kaaryakari dev richardsan ke anusaar vivaadaaspad nirnay samiksha pranali (diares) kaa virodh karne ke bhartiya cricket board ke paas apane kaaran hai

 nishchit taur par ham sudhaar kar sakate hai tathaa teen rivyuu jaisi baton par vichaar kar sakate hai
 '' Comments unhone kaha, ‘‘sachaai yah he ki das sadsy hai or prayek ke paas ek mat he
 Anyone can say 'listen we don't want to agree on this
 ’ yadi kam se saat desh diares ke upyog ke liye sahamat ho jaati he to phir yah lagu ho jayega
 '' ampiron kii galatiyon ke kaaran charchaa main rahe trentbrij test ke bare main richardsan ne kaha ki yah mushkil match tha
 Richardson was asked why the ICC issued a press release after the match taking the umpires' data , saying, "I think it was necessary to clarify
" yah mushkil test match tha or pich aasaan nahin thi
 Something was happening in every five overs and we needed to clear Pakistan and admit our mistakes
 usamen ampiron ne saat galtiyaan kii or unamem se chaar sudhaar di gai
 ' richardsan ne duusare test match main lunch ke dauraan england ke purv captain david gavar ke saath televijan par baatcheet main kaha, ‘‘bharat ke paas (iske virodh ke) kuch achche kaaran he or kuch masale sandehaaspad hai
 Surely we can improve and consider things like three reviews

 kisi ne mujhe ek baat padhakar sunai thi, jo angrejon ne gandhi ji ke bare main kahi thi ki is aadmi se bachanaa, yah bahut khatarnaak aadmi he kyonki iske paas khone ko kuch nahin he

 main to taxi chalaane ke liye bhi taiyaar tha
 It was a period in which suffering took place
 lekin jis samay mujh par boforce ke aarope lagaae gaye or main saansad bana, vah daur bahut hi kathin tha
 Actually, without knowing politics we drifted into it
 ek maheene baad hi pataa chal gaya ki isamen bhavanaaen koi kaam nahin karatin
 i gave up and left politics
 phir jab abisiel diwalia ho gai or sari filmein asafal ho gayi, kurki lag gai, us daur main ek bhi rupaya nahin tha jeb main, 50-60 cese the, ghar hamaara nilaam kar rahe the, pataa nahin chal rahaa tha ki kaise niklenge is sab se
 But somehow he recovered after working hard
 ye do daur bahut hi kathin the
 During this time many people came close to you
 rajeev gandhi aapke dost the, amar singh dost the, bal thakare parivaar se aapaki dosti he, inamen se najadik aap kise samajhate hai?sab najadik hai
 We have considered Amar Singh as a member of our family and still believe it
 vahi rishta gandhi parivaar se he or vahi rishta bala sahab se he
 Whatever the politics of Balasaheb, he has always considered us and Jaya as members of his family
 jab ham jaya ko byaah kar laae the to unhone jaya ko is tarah se apane ghar main pravesh karavaaya jaise ki unke ghar main bahu aa rahi ho
 When someone shows us such feelings, we have an emotional connection with him
 ham unki raajnneeti main dakhal nahin karte or na hi vah hamase aisa kuch karne ko kehete hai
 You once told us about the Gandhi family that they closed the doors for us
 aisa lagata he ki ab daravaaje khule hai aapke or unke dil se bhi
 No door is closed in my heart
 main keval yahi kahana chahta hum ki jo rishta babuji or manji ne gandhi parivaar ke saath, jawaharlal nehru ke samay se, motilal ji ke samay se, sarojini naidu ke samay se banaaya he uskaa main marate dam tak aadar karuunga
 Three women in your family - Jaya ji, Shweta and Aishwarya ji - Which one is more important to you
 shweta

 The day he started wearing our shoe, he became our friend
 udyogpatiyon se bhi aapke sambandh hai
 Anil Ambani, Kumar Mangalam, Sahara Sh
 kiske saath zyada sahaj mahasoos karte hai
 All along
 kumaar mangalam ji ke dadaji ke bhi pehle ke 
 Babuji has had a relationship since ages, from Ghanshyamdas Birla to Vasant Kumar ji, who is Kumar Mangalam's grandfather, a very old relationship with Aditya Birla
 us rishte ko ham kaise bhul sakate hai
 When you tell our friendship with Kumar Mangalam ji, we pay attention to that relationship, respect it, which was started by Manji and Babuji
 yahi baat agar aap kahenge to anil ambani or sahaara shri main nahin he kyonki unke saath hamaara koi paariwarik sambandh nahin he
 This close association happened when we came into the film industry
 hamaare yug main hamaari ye dosti anil ke saath or sahaara shri ke saath he
 You believe in taking forward the thing that is going on from generation to generation and also believe in taking forward the friendship that you have formed during your times
 rajeev gandhi se aapaki bahut acchhee dosti thi, aapako lagata he ki rahul abhishek main bhi aisi dosti honi chahie, badhani chahie
 i believe that it is and should be
 agar is peedi main ham koi sambandh banaate hai to main yah ummid karata hum ki aane vaali peedi jo he-abhishek, yaa unke bachche yaa unke bhi bachche is sambandh ko banaae rakhenge
 If they understand, as i believe, that it is my duty to maintain the things started by manji-babuji and there is a rule in the family that we uphold those rules and regulations
 phir se romantic bhoomika kerani pade to kis adaakara ke saath karnaa chahenge?jo bhi abhinetri sahi baithti he us role main to uske saath kaam karne main koi etraj nahin he
 Don't you think that you should do a role that can provide direction to the country? i feel that i don't have enough ability in myself to think so that's why i am always in the hope of thinking such a character and then i Let him play lekin jaisaa ki aapane kaha ki desh ke liye kuch karnaa chahta hum to main uski charchaa nahin karata hum lekin charity aadi ke rup main bahut kuch karata rahata hum

 Mumbai's Bandra Linking Road and the market adorned on it may undergo metamorphosis
 biemasi is road ke vikaas kii nai yojana laayaa he, lekin biemasi ko dukandaaron kaa virodh jhelana pad rahaa he
 Mumbai's Bandra-linking street, adorned with clothes, shoes and other things of fashion, and the decorating market here are among the city's main markets, but now preparations are underway to change the map
 biemasi yahaan ek shopping plaza, ek subway or 600 gadiyon ke liye parking spes bananaa chaah rahi he, lekin bandra-linking road par based dukandaar virodh kar rahe hai
 He says that he never thought of such a big plan
 filhal biemasi unhen yahaan se hataakar sadak ke paas basaane kii baat kar rahi he, lekin dukandaaron kaa kahana he ki unhen puri tarah se hataa diya jayega, jiske chalate unase unki jeevika kaa saadhan chhin jayega
 The comments dukandaaron ke saath yahaan khariddaari karne vaale log bhi naakhush hai
 They believe that this will change the map of this road, which is considered to be the identity of Mumbai, and this market
 saath hi apane saste daamon ke liye janaa jane vaala yah bazaar mahangaa ho jayega
 This design of the bandra-linking Road metamorphosis has been approved by the BMC chief

 kapadon, juuton or fishan kii baaki chizon se saji mumbai kii bandra-linking sadak or yahaan sajaa bazaar shahar ke mukhya bazaaron main se he, lekin ab iskaa nakshaa badalane kii taiyaari ho rahi he
 The BMC is looking to create a shopping plaza, a subway and parking space for 600 vehicles, but shopkeepers on the Bandra-linking road are protesting
 unka kahana he ki itani badi yojana se pehle unke bare main nahin sochaa gaya
 Currently, the BMC is talking of removing them from here and settling near the road, but the shopkeepers say that they will be removed completely, due to which they will lose their means of livelihood
 tippaniyan Shopkeepers are unhappy with shoppers here
 unka maananaa he ki isse mumbai kii pahchaan maane jane vaali is sadak kaa or is bazaar kaa nakshaa badal jayega
 Also known for its cheap prices, this market will become expensive
 bandra-linking road ke kayapalat ke is dizine ko biemasi pramukh kii manzuri mil chuki he
 But the real challenge is to implement this design
 haalanki is yojana ko abhi kai vibhaagon se manzuri milani baaki he, lekin chaahe linking rod par based dukandaar hon yaa fir yahaan khariddaari karne vaale log- koi bhi is yojana se khush dikhaai nahin de rahaa

 ' unhone kaha ki sarkaar ko viklangon ko desh ke aarthik, saamaajik evam raajnneetik jivan main prabhaavshaalee tareeke se hissaa lene se rokane vaali saanskrithik, saamaajik, shaareerik or soch sambandhi baadhaon ke kaaran viklangon se jude apyash, bhedbhaav or haashiye par daalane ke muddon par dhyaan dena chahie

 Once again the platform of India Today Conclave has been decorated, before the Lok Sabha Elections 2019, political stalwarts are presenting their views on this platform
 is kaarykram main modi sarkaar main grih rajyamantri kiran rigiju pahunche
 In the present scenario, the issues of the Ministry of Home Affairs were not openly talked about but what changes were brought about by the BJP government in North East East, must be highlighted
 India Today Conclave 2019 ke satr 'second Lieutenants: Is the BJP war ready? Lessons
 Introspection
 And visions for the future' main baat karte hue kiran rigiju ne kaha ki pichley 5 saalon main centre main bijepi sarkaar hone se north east main bade badlaav aae hai
 Rijiju said that in 2014 BJP was only symbolic in North East but in 2019 it is present with strength
 north east ke kai rajyon main sarkaar he or kai main bhagidaar he
 The Security Forces Act is also slowly ending in the North Eastern states
 sirf nagaland main ye act abhi bhi puri tarah maujuud he
 There has also been development in North East under PM Modi's Look East Policy
 vahaan kai nae airport banaae gaye hai or kuch ban rahe hai
 Now there is no middleman between the public and the leader, on which issues will the 2019 election be fought? Responding to this, Rijiju said that the government's performance should not be evaluated by any one incident
 sarkaar ke puure kaamkaaj kaa moolyankan hona chahie
 People can reach us directly There is no middleman now
 ek chook kaa hota he baari nuksanantarik suraksha ke mudde par kendriya mantri kiran rigiju ne kaha ki agar pichley paanch saal main dekhen to seemaayi ilaakon main kuch aatanki ghatnaon ko chhod kar desh ke anya hisson main koi ghatana nahin hui
 We have done a good job on the issue of internal security which has reduced the incidence by 79 per cent
 lekin suraksha ke mudde par har vakt satark rahanaa hota he, ek chook kaa baari nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 It is worth noting that earlier in the India Today Conclave, BJP President Amit Shah said that surgical strikes after Uri attack and air strikes after Pulwama proves that it is not the government of 2004 to 2014, but the government of 2014 to 2019
 ab pakistan ko faisla lenaa he ki wo kya karnaa chahega
 Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan, Shah said what evidence he needed to condemn the Pulwama attack
 india today conklev 2019 main 1 or 2 march ko jwalanth masalon par shandaar bahes or charchaaen hongi
 In this forum of two days of ideas and debate, views are being put on issues related to terrorism and security, science and technology, spirituality, as well as internet and entertainment

 Abhinandan Vardhaman, the Wing Commander of the Indian Air Force who came after beating Pakistan and entering his house, has returned to his homeland with great pride
 shuukravaar raat jab 9 bajkar 21 minute par abhinandan ne apni dharti par kadam rakhaa, to unke swaagat main puraa desh khadaa tha
 The Indian cricket team also saluted their hero, Team India released a jersey with the name of Wing Commander Abhinandan written on it and the jersey number is 1
 bataa den ki shuukravaar ko hi bhartiya cricket team kii nai jersey launch hui he
 Wearing this jersey, the Indian team will play in the World Cup
 isi dauraan bhartiya team ne abhinandan ke naam kii bhi jersey jari kii
 Jersey's number one is given, meaning they are given priority above all players
 yani ab bhartiya team main kisi bhi khilaadi ko number 1 kii jersey nahin di jaaegi, kyonki ab vah abhinandan ke naam par he

 After voting in five states' assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram, now PM Modi and BJP president have focused their entire attention on how to win Rajasthan and Telangana elections
 rajasthan or telugana chunaav dhire-dhire apane charam par pahunchane laga he
 PM Modi and Amit Shah are well aware that their party is not able to form government in Telangana, but in the triangular elections, if such a situation arises that if no party gets majority, then BJP will support Chandrashekhar Rao's TRS in 2019 Lok Sabha
 NDA may increase the clan before the election
 paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main agar bijepi ko congress se kahin kadi takkar mil rahi he to wo he rajasthan, ye baat bijepi ke netaa khule manch se sweekaar kar rahe hai
 Rajasthan has 33 districts, including 200 assemblies
 lekin ek baar phir bijepi ko rajasthan main satta ke sheersh par pahunchane ke liye amit shah kii chunavi ranneeti kaa focus 22 jilon kii 120 vidhansabha siton par hai
 PM Modi has so far conducted only 10 election rallies in Rajasthan
 ye reliyaan alvar, bhilwara, beneshwar dham, kota, nagaur or bharatpur main hui hai
 After coming from his foreign tour, he will also rally in Jodhpur, Hanumangarh, Sikar and Jaipur
 antim dinon main chunavi maahaul ko dekhte hue unki do-teen raily badhaai ja sakati he
 According to Amit Shah's election strategy, PM Modi may be holding 10 election rallies, but these rallies are expected to have a big 'modi effect'
 amit shah bhi 12 jile falodi, barmer, jalaur, sirohi, duungarpur, deeg-kumher, karauli, sa
 They are holding election rallies in Madhopur, Khajuwala, Nawalgarh, Sujangarh and Raisinghnagar
 sutron kii maane to amit shah kii chunavi ranneeti ke focus main ye 22 jile isliye hai kyonki in jilon main centre sarkaar kii garib kalyaan yojanaon kaa khaasaa asar jameen par dekhne ko mila he
 So BJP hopes to win about 80 seats in 120 seats in 22 districts
 matlab saaf he ki piem modi or amit shah chunavi ank ganit main modi sarkaar kii garib kalyaan yojanaayen mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaaengi
 PM Modi and Amit Shah start executing their strategies almost a year before the election, which gives them an advantage in elections

 kapil sharma ek baar phir vivaadon main hai
 Actually, during his show, he joked with actor Sanjay Dutt about his girlfriends and it went viral due to wrong reasons
 kapil ne sanjay se poocha tha ki aakhir unhone kaise itani ladakiyon ko garlfrends banane ke liye raji kiya? is par sanjay ne kaha ki ve ab bhi apni garlfrends kaa count rakhte hai

 We, the people of India, make India a complete sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, and all its citizens: social, economic and political justice, freedom of thought, expression, belief, religion and worship, prestige and opportunity
 To achieve equality, and to strengthen the fraternity that ensures the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation in all of them

 The Preamble to the Constitution of India underwent an amendment in 1976 and added unity and integrity with the Socialist, Secular
 apatkaal ke dauraan yah sanshodhan hua tha
 The government that came after that removed many amendments made during the Emergency through the 43rd and 44th amendments but it also did not remove the secular, socialist, integrity and unity
 iskaa matlab yah he ki us vakt kii sabhi dalon ne in baton ko sweekaar kiya hoga
 There are some words in the Constitution that we do not discuss
 - samanta - Freedom - bandhutav The commonality of equality is that 73 percent of the total wealth of India is with one percent of the people, and 67 percent of the poor have the same amount as the money they have
 aarthik aankade bataate hai ki ham samanta ke paimaane par khare utre hai

 1956 main doctor es radhakrishnan ne likhaa tha ki 'jab bharat yah kahata he ki vah secular rajya he to iskaa matlab yah nahin ki ve jivan main dharm kii praasangikta ko thukraa rahaa he
 It also does not mean that secularism is a positive religion in itself or that the state has acquired some divine authority
 ham yah maanate hai ki kisi bhi dharm ko zyaada mahatv nahin diya jayega
 Religious neutrality has a big role in national and international life

 bahut had tak kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ke maamle main bijepi ke upar ye baat lagu hoti he
 Giriraj Singh may have regretted the ruckus made on the statement made by Congress President Sonia Gandhi in Hajipur in Bihar, even though the party president Amit Shah has also completed the formalities of asking him to refrain from making such controversial statements in future
 And this news has also been leaked in the media
 lekin giriraj aise bayaan kyon dete hai or party yaa sarkaar ke mukhiya narendra modi aakhir kin majaburiyon ke kaaran unke khilaaf karrwai nahin kar pate isaki ek alag kahani he
 Actually, there is not much in Giriraj Singh's political biodata, but say the biggest achievement of his political journey or the capital that he has been a friend of some people or the transition period in BJP
 lekin chhipakar nahin balki danke kii chot par or jin logon ke sukh dukh main wo saath rahe unamem do naam pramukh hai, ek he narendra modi or duusare amit shah
 In Bihar, the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal United and BJP leaders kept distance or say political apartheid against Modi with the consent of the top leadership of his party at that time, and Giriraj regularly since 2010 Singh had privately run the Narendra Modi Fans Club, whose job was to make a statement in support of Modi on every occasion
 nitish kumaar kii sabha yaa jis shahar main daura ho vahaan modi ke poster vaale get lagavaana or puure desh main aap kah sakate hai ki giriraaj 'modi naam kevalam' karne vaale mul gayak yaa chiyar leader the
 As far as Amit Shah is concerned, it is known that for many years, due to the court order, he used to roam in every state of the country due to the restriction on going to Gujarat and whenever he went to Bihar, Giriraj did any work for his guest Nawaji
 Did not leave aap kah sakate hai ki giriraaj ke jyotishiyon ne in donon netaaon ke bhavishya ke bare main shaayad unhen sateek bhavishyavaanee kar di thi, jisapar giriraaj ne amal karne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 And when Giriraj Singh was a candidate from the Nawada Lok Sabha constituency on a party ticket last year and when Modi went to campaign for him, he appealed to the people that they are contesting the election, not Giriraj, so after the vote, the development of Nawada He will leave no stone unturned
 or shaayad yahi kaaran he ki giriraaj kai muqadamon or inakam tex main lambit maamle ke baad bhi kendriya mantrimandal main na keval jagah pate hai balki unhen ek aise mantralay kii jimmevary di jaati he jisamen pradhanmantri kii ruchi hoti he
 Giriraj not only became a minister, but made a police officer of his homeland his personal secretary, whose central deputation case was stuck for months due to some reasons
 jabaki iske pehle pradhanmantri modi ke tevar se saafe tha ki koi kendriya mantri apane staff main apane swajaateey logon khaskar vaise logon ko shaayad nahin rakh saktaa jinke khilaaf koi maamla chal rahaa ho
 But when the matter is of Giriraj, Modi also bowed down
 saafe tha ki na keval giriraaj ke liye saare khun maaf the balki wo chaahe bayaan den yaa paise rakhen, unke liye modi gandhi ji ke bandar kii tarah na kuch apriy sun sakate the na dekh sakate the
 But now the question is why no action can be taken against him? There is one and only reason for this, that people of that Bhumihar caste, from which caste they come, can have a very negative reaction
 chunavi varsh main shaayad modi is jati kaa gussa jhelane ke liye taiyaar nahin
 Modi will remember the experience of Atal Bihari Vajpayee when he wrote Dr
 seepi thakur ko bhrashtachar ke ek maamle main mantrimandal se hataaya tha tab bihar bijepi ke netaa puure rajya main virodh pradarshan ke baad unke paas pahunche or unase aagrah kiya ki aap unhen phir mantri bana dijie kyonki banane se koi phayda ho yaa nahin hataane se us jati ke logon main gusse ke kaaran rajnatik rup se bahut nuksaan ho rahaa he
 In the end, Giriraj Singh says that he had said all things off the record and the media has done a lot wrong by recording and showing it
 lekin jab unase kisi ne poocha ki aapaki party dilli main AAP ke maamle main sting par itnaa uchhal-uchhal kar bayaan dete hai tab aapke saath narmi kyon
 Then Giriraj also denied that you will reap as you sow
 supreme court ne mangalvaar ko vyavastha di ki centre sarkaar kii mahila karmchaaree apane bachche kii dekhbhaal ke liye bagaiyr kisi vyavdhaan ke do saal kaa avkaash le sakati he
 Justice SJ Mukhopadhyay and Justice v Gopal Gowda gave this order while quashing the order of the Calcutta High Court
 ucch nyaayalay ne kaha tha ki kendriya civil seva (avkaash) ke niyam bacchon kii dekhbhaal ke liye bagaiyr kisi vyavdhaan ke 730 din ke avkaash kii ijaajat nahin dete hai
 The observation of the circulars and Rule 43-C, the judges said, shows that the mother of a minor child under the age of 18 can take leave of government women employees for a maximum period of 730 days without any interruption
 bacchon kii dekhbhaal sirf chote bachche ko paalane posane ke liye nahin balki unki pariksha or beemaari jaisi jaruraton ke liye bhi he
 The court said that more than 730 days of leave can be given for taking care of children, including other holidays if holidays are available
 adaalat ne yah bhi kaha ki ucch nyaayalay kaa nishkarsh na to niyam 43-si par or na hi kendra sarkaar ke dishanirdeshon par aadhaarit he
 The court heard this arrangement on a petition by a government woman employee, Kakli Ghosh, who challenged the government's decision to deny her 730 days leave to prepare for her son's examination
 is mahila karmchaaree ne pehle kolkata sthit kendriya prashasnic nyaayaadhikaran main guhaar lagaai thi
 The tribunal ruled in favor of this employee but the decision was overturned by the High Court

 a hearing has begun in the Supreme Court today on petitions seeking to hurt the spirit of the Constitution against Musharraf and imposing Emergency in 2007
 nyaayadhish jawad es khwaja kii adhyakshata vaali do sadasyeey peeth ne grih sachiv ko aadesh diya ki vah musharraf ko videsh jane se rokane ke liye kadam uthaaen
 The bench issued these directions after an initial hearing on five petitions urging the Supreme Court to direct the government to prosecute Musharraf under the sedition (punishment) act 1973
 peeth ne sarkaar, musharraf tathaa anya prativaadiyon ko bhi notice jari kiye or maamle kii sunwaayee mangalvaar tak ke liye sthagit kar di
 The petitions stated that the former military ruler violated the Constitution by declaring a state of emergency in 2007 and should be prosecuted for treason
 yachikakartaon ne kaha he ki sansad ke upari sadan ne janvari 2012 main ek prastaav paarit kiya tha ki musharraf ko swadesh vaapasi par giraftaar kiya janaa chahie lekin sarkaar ne ise sweekaar nahin kiya
 The lawyers who filed the petitions also contended that the government had also failed to take action on the earlier order given by the Supreme Court directing the administration to take action against Musharraf for violating the constitution
 sunwaayee ke baad yachikakartaon ke vakeelon ne kaha ki musharraf ko ‘viipi protocol’ nahin diya jaae kyonki vah kai maamalon main aaropee hai
 He said that the case against the former President in the Supreme Court will ensure that no one will hurt the spirit of the Constitution in future
 unhone kaha ki musharraf kaa samarthan karne vaale generalon or anya logon ko bhi javabdeh banaaya janaa chahie
 Several hours before the hearing on the petitions began on Monday morning, Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary himself from the bench, a three-member judge set up last week to hear the pleas against Musharraf under the 'treason (penalty) Act 1973'
 Isolated varsh 2007 ke apatkaal ke dauraan musharraf dwaara hataae gaye darjanon jajon main choudhary ke bhi shaamil hone ke maddenjar unki nishpakshta ko lekar sawaal khadey kiye jane par unhone yah kadam uthaaya

 ek anya yachika ikbaal haidar dwaara daakhil kii gayi he
 Musharraf has been named in these petitions and the government has been made a defendant
 yachikakartaon ne supreme court se sarkaar ko musharraf ko hiraasat main liye jane kaa nirdesh dene ko bhi kaha he
 The petitioners say that Musharraf detained judges during the 2007 emergency and obstructed access to justice and unconstitutionally appointed other judges in his place

 a very surprising case of suicide has come out from Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh
 assam kii rahane vaali ek chaatra ne aatmahatya kii, lekin isse pehle usne apni maut kaa saamaan online mangava liya tha
 The shocking incident is from Bhopal's School of Planning and Architecture where Priyali Dey, a student from Assam, committed suicide in a girls hostel on campus
 khajuri police thane ke prabharee eldy mishra ke mutabik aatmahatya karne ke liye chaatra ne puraane tareekon se alag hatakar tarika apanaaya
 The student inserted the pipe of organ gas into the mouth and inverted the gas by turning on the nozzle of the cylinder
 sharir ke andar gas jane ke kuch hi der baad dam ghutane se chaatra kii maut ho gai
 According to TI Mishra, after putting the pipe of the gas cylinder in the mouth, the student tied the foil tightly on her face so that the gas does not leak and goes directly inside the body
 postmortem ke baad chaatra ke shav ko parivaar ko saunp diya gaya he
 Talking on the phone to the cylinder 'ajatak' ordered online before the suicide, LD Mishra, in-charge of Khajuri police station, said that the student had already made up his mind to commit suicide
 tiai mishra ne bataaya ki jaanch ke dauraan police ko hostel ke room se bill mili jisase ye pataa chalaa ki chaatra ne online shopping site se organ gas silendar bulawaaya tha
 The delivery date on the bill is written as of 23 August
 police ko apni jaanch ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki chaatra apni girti sehat ko lekar behad pareshaan rahati thi
 She had had an accident before and she used to take many different medicines

 In 2014, it has been approved to bring an ordinance for the Food Security Bill with a view to crossing the electoral waters of the Manmohan government
 vaise adhyadesh laakar food sicurity bill ko lagu karne par pehle upie main bhi matbhed the, ensipi jaisi party ko adhyadesh par aitraaj tha
 Indeed, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Food Safety Ordinance
 adhyadesh ko 6 maheene ke bheetar sansad ke donon sadanon main paarit hona he
 Objective of Food Security Bill 1

 About 1 on the government to provide food grains at a subsidized rate to about 80 crore people
 3 lakh karod rupee kaa bhaar padegaa
 In September 2012, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh defended the diesel price hike, saying that money does not grow on trees
 desh ne us vakt pehali baar janaa tha ki apane anbol pradhanmantri ko vanaspatiyon ke vigyaan kaa itnaa badhiya gyaan he
 But his phd is not in politics but in economics, so he thinks that whether money grows on trees or not, votes definitely grow on trees
 bas pet bharne kii der he
 Therefore, after bypassing twice, the cabinet changed the food guarantee to an ordinance

 Without sowing seeds, the king needs ripe and sweet fruits

 The Congress led by Sonia Gandhi, which has reiterated parliamentary traditions, has also run away from the debate in Parliament on the food guarantee bill
 lekin sawaal pet kaa nahin, vot kaa he isliye pichley darvaaze se paap dhakne kii taiyaari he
 Ordinance is correct if not law
 sonia ke sipaahiyon ne taiyaar kiya formulakhila-pilaakar vot lene kii parampara hindustan main nai nahin he
 Congress also knows its value
 isliye wo adhyadesh kii shakl main is shastr ko aajmaana chaahati he
 - 3 rupees kg rice - 2 rupees kg wheat - 6 thousand rupees to pregnant women - 75 percent of the villagers - 50 percent of the city in the last ten years, this formula of mercy has been prepared by Sonia Gandhi's soldiers
 unhen yakeen he ki ye wo tilism he jiske dam par use teesri baar hastinapur kii satta hasil ho sakati he
 The Opposition also believes that the government feels that the government will try the right to food ordinance like aces in elections, so it is also determined not to let the greed to feed and vote no matter what it is, without the legitimacy of Parliament Will go
 koi ruthe or koi chute, sarkaar chatapata rahi he
 After all, it is a question of sinful vote
 congress maanakar chal rahi he ki chunaav se chaar maheene pehle bharat ke logon ko bharpayt bhaat khilaakar wo vot kaa bhatta maangegi to koi manaa nahin kar paaegaa
 There are many types of stomach
 laalach kaa pet, lut kaa pet, pichakaa hua pet, ubhara hua pet
 But the stomach of politics is different from all these stomachs

 cabinet baithak ke baad khud mukhyamantri ne is sambandh main media ko jaankaree dete hue kaha tha ki samiti ko report dene ke liye chah maah kii mohalat di gai he
 He had also indicated to give a salary gift as per the intention of the Seventh Pay Commission before the election
 isliye mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar chunaav main jane se pehle vetan ayog ko lagu karne kii ghoshnaa bhi kar de
 But government employees are likely to get their salaries only during the tenure of the next government
 tippaniyan Explain that the implementation of the current recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission in the state may increase the additional burden of Rs 26,573 crore on the government in the first year
 acchhee baat yah he ki sarkaar monsoon satr main anupoorak bajet ke madhyam se dhanrashi kaa intjaam karne main jute gai he
 From the second year, an additional Rs 22,778 crore will have to be provided towards the salary of the employees
 abhi vetan, bhatton va pension par vaarshik 95000 karod rupee kharch hote hai
 In today's situation, if the recommendations of the Pay Commission were implemented by the state government, the salary of the state government employees would increase by an average of 25 percent
 iske alaava vetan ayog lagu hua tho uttar pradesh sarkaar ke karmchaariyon ke makaan kiraaye bhatte main 20 pratishat kii badhotaree bhi hogi

 unhone chunaav se pehle saatven vetan ayog kii manshaa ke anuroop vetan kaa tohfa dene kaa sanket bhi diya tha
 Therefore, it is believed that the government should also announce the implementation of the Pay Commission before going to the elections

 The comments bataa den ki rajya main saatven vetan ayog kii vartmaan siforeeshon ko lagu karne se sarkaar par pehle saal 26,573 karod rupee kaa atirikt boj bad saktaa he
 The good thing is that the government is busy arranging funds through the supplementary budget in the monsoon session

 Currently, 95000 crore rupees are spent annually on salaries, allowances and pensions

 While this may sound absurd, India Cements sold CSK to one of its subsidiaries in February 2015 at the same price

 Spot-fixing: Vivek Priyadarshi will investigate: The shocking thing is that the old council did not question this absurd price

 in chaatro kaa kahana he ki kendriya vidhyalay sanghathan, navoday vidhyalay or sena ke skulon main computer ke shikshake liye bied nahin hota he
 Often i have seen that restoration comes but sometimes new new conditions are added so that no one is found
 tippaniyan There is a Jaypee University in Chhapra, Bihar, people who have taken admission in BA in 2012 are still doing BA
 chaatr khud bataate hai ki 40,000 se adhik chaatr jepi uniwarsity ke chakkar main fanse hai
 Now, if 40,000 students cannot solve their problem together, then it should be understood that they and their family also do not want to pass BA before ten or twenty years
 ye bi aar ambedkar bihar vishvavidhyalay kaa langat singh college he
 a student of the 2016-19 batch here said that not a single year examination has been done so far
 kaayade se pratham varsh kii pariksha agast 2017 main ho jaani chahie thi magar vibhinn kaarnon se 2017 ke saal main is vishvavidhyalay main ek bhi pariksha nahin hui
 VC says that they have arrived 11 months ago and are busy fixing things
 chaatr sangh kaa chunaav or hadtaal ke kaaran 2017 zero year rahaa
 This university has about two lakh students
 is sankhya ke baad bhi agar chaatro kii ye haalat he to bahut dukhad he
 It seems that the parents of these students and the society of Bihar does not matter that their children are being ruined
 veri sad
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) 'itani shakti hamen dena daata, man kaa vishwaas kamazor ho na', ankush film kaa yah gaanaa gaate hue ye 12,460 shikshak itnaa pradarshan kar chuke hai ki vaaki inhen shakti or dhiraj kii bahut zarurat he
 On 15 March, they resumed in Lucknow and started demanding their joining
 bhaajapa mukhyalay ke saamne ye jamaa ho gaye or naare lagane lage
 Their fight is bizarre
 do-do baar adaalat se cese jeet chuke hai
 But the government is not joining them
 hamane ye masalaa prime time kii naukari series ke ank 7 or 24 main uthaaya tha or ab 28wein ank main bhi uthaa rahe hai
 One question cannot be answered as to why these people have not started the process of joining when they have won the case from single bench and double bench
 kyon nahin ho rahi he
 When 12,460 teachers can have this condition, then understand what will be the condition of the remaining examinations
 pehali baar ye 3 november 2017 ko elahabaad hai court se jeet gaye
 The court said that these teachers should be admitted in two months
 3 janvari 2018 ko do maheene puure ho gaye magar 12,460 shikshak bahaali kaa intazaar karte rah gaye
 The case was then heard in the division bench
 vahaan se bhi ye 12,460 shikshak jeet gaye
 This time the High Court asked the UP government to start the recruitment process within 4 weeks
 6 march ko chaar hafte puure ho gaye
 On 15 March, they again came out on dharna demonstration
 2016 main 12,460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 Its counseling continued till March 2017
 18 march 2017 tak saare zilon ke cat of gaye or merit list ban gai thi
 But on 23 March, the Yogi government banned these recruitments
 uske baad se ye noujvaan har maukey par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Sometimes they sit, they fight in court
 yahaan tak ki 16 july 2017 se teen sitambar 2017 tak dhai maheene lakhanu ke lakshmana mela maidan main dharna bhi diya
 Many mlas and mps have also written letters to the government for these, yet they are not joining
 kendriya shram evam rojgaar mantri santosh kumaar gangavar ne bhi inke samarthan main patr likhaa he phir bhi inaki jwoining nahin ho rahi he
 Why is there a need to write a letter, even if there are two orders of the court, nothing is happening
 agar kuch ho rahaa he, to sarkaar ko in 12,460 naujavaanon ko bataa dena chahie ki uski taiyaari kis str par he or iraadaa kya he
 Is that why we are being postponed so that they don't have to pay a few more days or is there something else
 pashchim bengal se bhi hamen naukari siries ke liye lagaataar log likhte rahete hai or bengal ke sarvice kamishan kaa haal bataate rahete hai
 In the 13th episode of prime time, we had shown that the youth of Bengal are living unemployed destitute
 west bengal sarvice kamishan ko best bengal public sarvice kamishan main mila diya gaya tha
 Earlier there were separate commissions for recruitment of officers and staff, now there is only one
 malda jile main shikshakon kii bahaali ke liye chal rahe andolan ko 25 din se adhik ho chuke hai lekin unki koi sunwaayee nahin kar rahaa he or wo hamen lagaataar sandesh bhejte hai
 Similarly, on March 7, madrasa teachers held a demonstration in Kolkata
 isse pehle bhi kai baar andolan kar chuke hai
 Their problem is that they brought them to our NDTV office from Bengal
 sangharsh karte-karte bag main dastavezon kii file moti ho gai he
 These people are also fighting the case in the Supreme Court
 inhone bataaya ki west bengal madrasa sarvice kamishan 2008 main bana tha, iske tahat 614 sarkari madad praapt madrasa skool hai
 Seven lakh students study
 bengal ke kolkata madrasa kalege kii sthapana 1780 main hui thi
 Flocked out of it performing
 ye log bengal kii alag alag jagahon main kai baar pradarshan kar chuke hai
 They say that they have performed more than 600 performances in Bengal
 294 vidhayak or 42 saansad inke liye patr likh chuke hai
 Petition has been given to the Chief Minister
 ye sabhi puraani baaten hai jo unhone hi bataai hai
 The case is that between 2008 and 2013, there were 12,000 teachers reinstated in them, but the Madrasa Management Committee made the case that the Madrasa Commission did not have the right to reinstate teachers and this interfered with the autonomy of the minority institution
 management cameti chaahati thi ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 30 ke anusaar bahaali kaa adhikaar uske paas rahe
 Teachers say that management first used arbitrary restorations
 kamishan se bahaali hone par pratiyogita ke baad inaki merit list bani he
 The future of these teachers is at stake in the Madrasas Management Committee and the Madrasa Service Commission's legal battle 
 kyonki 12 march 2014 ko hoicourt ne aadesh diya ki madrasa sarvice kamishan avaidh he
 Asked the commission not to make any kind of appointment
 kolkata hoicourt ke division bench ne bhi mana ki madrasa chayan ayog avaidh he or iske dwaara kii gai bahaaliyaan bhi avaidh hai
 Sword hangs on 12,000 teachers who were restored before this order
 ab supreme court ne do saal pehle hoicourt ke faisle par roak lagaate hue kaha ki riselt nikaal diya jaae
 The final decision did not come
 tab se is maamle ko kabhi hoicourt to kabhi supreme court chal rahaa he
 The next date in the Supreme Court is on 4 April
 hamen to pataa bhi nahin ki madrasa prabandhan samiti ke kya adhikaar hai yaa madrasa chayan ayog ko bhang kiye jane se kin logon kii zindagi prabhavit ho rahi he, log khud hi hamase sampark kar rahe hai jinhen ham thodi bahut jaanch ke baad aapke saamne rakh dete hai
 We thought that there would be a mistake in telling us, but so far no selection commission has said to what extent our point is wrong
 sab is intazaar main hai ki jaldi naukari series band ho jaae taaki phir sabakuch vaisaa hi chalata rahe
 After passing the Military Engineering Service exam, 476 youth are waiting for joining
 hamane jawaab ke liye sapanrk bhi kiya magar jawaab nahin mila
 In 2015, the advertisement of ssc-junior Engineer was released
 24 july 2016 ko mukhya pariksha hui jiskaa riselt 16 disambar 2016 ko aa gaya
 After scrutiny of documents, the result also came on 9 October 2017
 jis pariksha kaa vigyaapan 2015 ke saal main niklaa tha, uskaa nateeja aayaa oktober 2017 main
 That is, it took two years of examination
 uske baad ye saadhe chaar maheene se jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 These students say that no one is telling them when to join
 aap yakeen nahin karenge pariksha paas kar, merit list main aakar bhi ye noujvaan ghar baithe hue hai
 Nobody is going to tell them
 esayssi kii pariksha paas kar sieji ke liye sahaayak audit afasar ke liye chune gaye 1000 chaatr jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 24 students have been waiting for 7 months to join the department of industrial policy and promotion (dipp) by passing the SSCHSL 2015 exam
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki general catagori kii jwining ho gai he magar anusuchit jati or obisi chaatro kii jwining nahin ho rahi he
 You are wondering why i am doing this count, so i am doing it so that you can know whether the student is in the number of 24 or in the number of 12,460, there is no difference on the selection commissions
 kai baar lagata he ki sarkaar hi bahaali nahin karnaa chaahati he, chunaav aate hai to bhartiyon nikaal di jaati hai or uske baad kabhi court to kabhi nakal ke naam par inhen atka diya jaataa he
 We do not know whether bed degree is compulsory even for computer teacher, but in UP on March 15, 1500 computer teachers of LT grade have been reinstated, there is a condition of b
ed
 chaatro kaa kahana he yah thik nahin he
 Why should we go to b
ed after engineering
 hamaari koi raay nahin he is par, bas soochna ke taur par yahaan rakh rahaa hum
 These students say that there is no b
ed for computer education in Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, Navodaya Vidyalaya and Army schools
 aksar maine dekha he ki bahaali to aati he magar kai baar nai nai sharten jod di jaati hai taaki koi mili hi nahin
 The comments bihar ke chhapra main ek jepi uniwarsity he, isamen jin logon ne 2012 main bie main admician liya he wo abhi tak bie hi kar rahe hai
 The students themselves say that more than 40,000 students are caught in the affair of Jaypee University
 ab agar 40,000 chaatr milakar apni samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin kar sakate to phir yahi samajha janaa chahie ki ve or unke parivaar vaale bhi nahin chaahate hai das bees saal se pehle bie paas hon
 This is the Langat Singh College of BR Ambedkar Bihar University
 yahaan ke 2016-19 batch ke ek chaatr ne bataaya ki abhi tak ek bhi varsh kii pariksha nahin hui he
 Ideally, the first year examination should have been held in August 2017 but due to various reasons, there was not a single examination in this university in the year of 2017
 visi kaa kahana he ki ve 11 maheene pehle aae hai or chizon ko durust karne main lage hai
 2017 was a zero year due to student union elections and strike
 is vishvavidhyalay main kareeb do lakh chaatr hai
 Even after this number, if students have this condition then it is very sad
 aisa lagata he ki in chaatro ke mata-pita or bihar ke samaaj ko isse koi fark nahin padataa he ki unke bachche barbaad kiye ja rahe hai
 Very Sad
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) He won the Allahabad High Court for the first time on 3 November 2017
 court ne kaha ki do maheene main in shikshakon kii bhartee ho jaani chahie
 Two months were completed on 3 January 2018, but 12,460 teachers were waiting for reinstatement
 phir yah maamla division bench main suna gaya
 From there also these 12,460 teachers won
 is baar hoicourt ne upi sarkaar se kaha ki 4 hafte ke bheetar bhartee kii prakriya shuru kiijie
 Four weeks were completed on 6 March
 15 march ko ye phir dharne pradarshan par utar aae hai
 In 2016, advertisement for recruitment of 12,460 teachers was released
 march 2017 tak isaki counselling chalati rahi
 By March 18, 2017, all the districts were cut off and merit list was made
 lekin 23 march ko yogi sarkaar ne in bhartiyon par roak laga di
 Since then these youngsters have been performing on every occasion
 kabhi dharna dete hai, kabhi adaalat main mukadmaa ladate hai
 Even two and a half months from July 16, 2017 to September 3, 2017, staged a protest at the Lakshman Mela ground in Lucknow
 bahut se vidhayak or saansadon ne inke liye sarkaar ko patr bhi likhaa he phir bhi inaki jwoining nahin ho rahi he
 Union Labor and Employment Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar has also written a letter in support of them, yet they are not joining
 patr likhane kii zarurat hi kyon he, adaalat ke do-do aadesh hai tab bhi kuch nahin ho rahaa
 If anything is going on, the government should tell these 12,460 youngsters at what stage their preparation is and what is the intention
 kya isliye taala ja rahaa he taaki kuch din or inhen vetan na dena pade yaa koi or baat he
 People from West Bengal also continue to write to us for job series and keep telling the condition of the service commission of Bengal
 prime time ke 13wein episod main hamane dikhaaya tha ki bengal ke yuva berozegaar besahaara maare-maare phir rahe hai
 The West Bengal Service Commission was merged with the Best Bengal Public Service Commission
 pehle adhikariyon or karmchaariyon kii bhartee ke liye alag-alag ayog hote the, ab vahaan ek hi he
 The ongoing agitation for the reinstatement of teachers in Malda district has been over 25 days but no one is listening to them and they send us constant messages
 isi tarah 7 march ko madrasa ke shikshakon ne kolkata main ek pradarshan kiya
 Even before this, we have agitated many times
 inaki pareshaani kaa alam ye he ki wo inhen bengal se hamaare enditivi karyaalay le ai
 The file of documents in the bag has become thick while struggling
 ye log supreme court main bhi cese lard rahe hai
 He told that the West Bengal Madrasa Service Commission was formed in 2008, there are 614 government aided madrasa schools under it
 saat lakh chaatr padhate hai
 Kolkata Madrasa College in Bengal was established in 1780
 iske baahar hujum pradarshan kar rahaa he
 These people have performed several times in different places of Bengal
 inkaa kahana he ki ye bengal main 600 se adhik pradarshan kar chuke hai
 294 mlas and 42 mps have written letters for them
 mukhyamantri ko yachika di ja chuki he
 These are all old things that he has told
 maamla yah he ki 2008 se 2013 ke bich inamen 12,000 shikshakon kii bahaali hui thi lekin madrason kii prabandhan samiti ne hi cese kar diya ki madrasa kamishan ko shikshakon kii bahaali kaa adhikaar nahin he or yah alpsankhyak santhaan kii swaittata main dakhldanzi he
 The management committee wanted it to retain the right of reinstatement as per Article 30 of the Constitution
 shikshak kehete hai ki prabandhan pehle manamaane tareeke se behaal karata tha
 His merit list has been made after the competition on his reinstatement from the Commission
 madrason kii prabandhan samiti or madrasa sarvice kamishan kii kanoonee ladaai me in shikshakon kaa bhavishya daanv par he
 Because on 12 March 2014 the High Court ordered that the Madrasa Service Commission is illegal
 kamishan ko kaha ki wo kisi prakaar kii niyukti na kare
 The Division Bench of the Kolkata High Court also held that the Madrasa Selection Commission is illegal and the restorations made by it are also illegal
 is aadesh se pehle behaal ho chuke 12,000 shikshakon par talwaar latak gai he
 Now two years ago, the Supreme Court stayed the High Court ruling and said that the result should be removed
 antim faisla nahin aayaa
 Since then, the High Court is sometimes running the Supreme Court
 supreme court main agali taarikh 4 april ko padi he
 We do not even know what are the rights of the Madrasa Management Committee or the people whose lives are being affected by the dissolution of the Madrasa Selection Commission, people are contacting us themselves, which we would put before you after a little investigation Huh
 hamen lagata tha ki hamaare bataane main koi chook hogi, magar abhi tak kisi bhi chayan ayog ne ye tak nahin kaha ki hamaari baat kis had tak galat he
 Everyone is waiting for the job series to stop soon so that everything will continue the same
 military ejineering sarvice kii pariksha paas karne ke baad 476 noujvaan jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 We also contacted for an answer but did not get a reply
 2015 main ssc-junior Engineer kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 The main examination took place on 24 July 2016, the result of which came on 16 December 2016
 dastavezon kii jaanch ke baad 9 oktober 2017 ko riselt bhi aa gaya
 The result of the examination, which was advertised in the year 2015, came in October 2017
 yani do saal to imtahaan main hi lag gaye
 After that, they have been waiting for joining for four and a half months
 in chaatro kaa kahana he ki unhen koi bataa nahin rahaa ki kab jwining hogi
 You will not believe that by passing the examination, even after coming on the merit list, these youngsters are sitting at home
 inhen koi bataane vaala nahin he
 1000 students selected for Assistant Audit Officer for CAG are waiting for joining after passing SSC examination
 esessisiechaesel 2015 kii pariksha paas kar department of industrial policy and promotion (dipp) main jwining ke liye 24 chaatr 7 maheene se intazaar kar rahe hai
 Students say that the general category has been joined but scheduled caste and OBC students are not joining
 aap soch rahe hai ki main ye ginati kyon kar rahaa hum, isliye kar rahaa hum taaki aapako pataa chal sake chaatr chaahe 24 kii sankhya main ho yaa 12,460 kii sankhya main, chayan aayogon par koi fark nahin padataa he
 At times, it seems that the government does not want to be reinstated, recruitments are removed when elections come and after that they are sometimes stuck in the name of copying court
 kya computer shikshak ke liye bhi bied kii degree anivaary hoti he, iskaa hamen kuch pataa nahin magar upi main 15 march ko alti grad ke 1500 computer shikshakon kii bahaali ai he usamen bied kii shart he
 It is not right for the students to say
 ham ejineering karne ke baad bied karne hi kyon jaaen
 We have no opinion on this, just keeping it here as information
 in chaatro kaa kahana he ki kendriya vidhyalay sanghathan, navoday vidhyalay or sena ke skulon main computer ke shikshake liye bied nahin hota he

 Earlier there were separate commissions for recruitment of officers and staff, now there is only one
 malda jile main shikshakon kii bahaali ke liye chal rahe andolan ko 25 din se adhik ho chuke hai lekin unki koi sunwaayee nahin kar rahaa he or wo hamen lagaataar sandesh bhejte hai
 Similarly, on March 7, madrasa teachers held a demonstration in Kolkata
 isse pehle bhi kai baar andolan kar chuke hai
 Their problem is that they brought them to our NDTV office from Bengal
 sangharsh karte-karte bag main dastavezon kii file moti ho gai he
 These people are also fighting the case in the Supreme Court
 inhone bataaya ki west bengal madrasa sarvice kamishan 2008 main bana tha, iske tahat 614 sarkari madad praapt madrasa skool hai
 Seven lakh students study
 bengal ke kolkata madrasa kalege kii sthapana 1780 main hui thi
 Flocked out of it performing
 ye log bengal kii alag alag jagahon main kai baar pradarshan kar chuke hai
 They say that they have performed more than 600 performances in Bengal
 294 vidhayak or 42 saansad inke liye patr likh chuke hai
 Petition has been given to the Chief Minister
 ye sabhi puraani baaten hai jo unhone hi bataai hai
 The case is that between 2008 and 2013, there were 12,000 teachers reinstated in them, but the Madrasa Management Committee made the case that the Madrasa Commission did not have the right to reinstate teachers and this interfered with the autonomy of the minority institution
 management cameti chaahati thi ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 30 ke anusaar bahaali kaa adhikaar uske paas rahe
 Teachers say that management first used arbitrary restorations
 kamishan se bahaali hone par pratiyogita ke baad inaki merit list bani he
 The future of these teachers is at stake in the Madrasas Management Committee and the Madrasa Service Commission's legal battle
 kyonki 12 march 2014 ko hoicourt ne aadesh diya ki madrasa sarvice kamishan avaidh he
 Asked the commission not to make any kind of appointment
 kolkata hoicourt ke division bench ne bhi mana ki madrasa chayan ayog avaidh he or iske dwaara kii gai bahaaliyaan bhi avaidh hai
 Sword hangs on 12,000 teachers who were restored before this order
 ab supreme court ne do saal pehle hoicourt ke faisle par roak lagaate hue kaha ki riselt nikaal diya jaae
 The final decision did not come
 tab se is maamle ko kabhi hoicourt to kabhi supreme court chal rahaa he
 The next date in the Supreme Court is on 4 April
 hamen to pataa bhi nahin ki madrasa prabandhan samiti ke kya adhikaar hai yaa madrasa chayan ayog ko bhang kiye jane se kin logon kii zindagi prabhavit ho rahi he, log khud hi hamase sampark kar rahe hai jinhen ham thodi bahut jaanch ke baad aapke saamne rakh dete hai
 We thought that there would be a mistake in telling us, but so far no selection commission has said to what extent our point is wrong
 sab is intazaar main hai ki jaldi naukari series band ho jaae taaki phir sabakuch vaisaa hi chalata rahe
 After passing the Military Engineering Service exam, 476 youth are waiting for joining
 hamane jawaab ke liye sapanrk bhi kiya magar jawaab nahin mila
 In 2015, the advertisement of ssc-junior Engineer was released
 24 july 2016 ko mukhya pariksha hui jiskaa riselt 16 disambar 2016 ko aa gaya
 After scrutiny of documents, the result also came on 9 October 2017
 jis pariksha kaa vigyaapan 2015 ke saal main niklaa tha, uskaa nateeja aayaa oktober 2017 main
 That is, it took two years of examination
 uske baad ye saadhe chaar maheene se jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 These students say that no one is telling them when to join
 aap yakeen nahin karenge pariksha paas kar, merit list main aakar bhi ye noujvaan ghar baithe hue hai
 Nobody is going to tell them
 esayssi kii pariksha paas kar sieji ke liye sahaayak audit afasar ke liye chune gaye 1000 chaatr jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 24 students have been waiting for 7 months to join the department of industrial policy and promotion (dipp) by passing the SSCHSL 2015 exam
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki general catagori kii jwining ho gai he magar anusuchit jati or obisi chaatro kii jwining nahin ho rahi he
 You are wondering why i am doing this count, so i am doing it so that you can know whether the student is in the number of 24 or in the number of 12,460, there is no difference on the selection commissions
 kai baar lagata he ki sarkaar hi bahaali nahin karnaa chaahati he, chunaav aate hai to bhartiyon nikaal di jaati hai or uske baad kabhi court to kabhi nakal ke naam par inhen atka diya jaataa he
 We do not know whether bed degree is compulsory even for computer teacher, but in UP on March 15, 1500 computer teachers of LT grade have been reinstated, there is a condition of b
ed
 chaatro kaa kahana he yah thik nahin he
 Why should we go to b
ed after engineering
 hamaari koi raay nahin he is par, bas soochna ke taur par yahaan rakh rahaa hum
 These students say that there is no b
ed for computer education in Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, Navodaya Vidyalaya and Army schools
 aksar maine dekha he ki bahaali to aati he magar kai baar nai nai sharten jod di jaati hai taaki koi mili hi nahin
 The comments bihar ke chhapra main ek jepi uniwarsity he, isamen jin logon ne 2012 main bie main admician liya he wo abhi tak bie hi kar rahe hai
 The students themselves say that more than 40,000 students are caught in the affair of Jaypee University
 ab agar 40,000 chaatr milakar apni samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin kar sakate to phir yahi samajha janaa chahie ki ve or unke parivaar vaale bhi nahin chaahate hai das bees saal se pehle bie paas hon
 This is the Langat Singh College of BR Ambedkar Bihar University
 yahaan ke 2016-19 batch ke ek chaatr ne bataaya ki abhi tak ek bhi varsh kii pariksha nahin hui he
 Ideally, the first year examination should have been held in August 2017 but due to various reasons, there was not a single examination in this university in the year of 2017
 visi kaa kahana he ki ve 11 maheene pehle aae hai or chizon ko durust karne main lage hai
 2017 was a zero year due to student union elections and strike
 is vishvavidhyalay main kareeb do lakh chaatr hai
 Even after this number, if students have this condition then it is very sad
 aisa lagata he ki in chaatro ke mata-pita or bihar ke samaaj ko isse koi fark nahin padataa he ki unke bachche barbaad kiye ja rahe hai
 Very Sad
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) People from West Bengal also continue to write to us for job series and keep telling the condition of the service commission of Bengal
 prime time ke 13wein episod main hamane dikhaaya tha ki bengal ke yuva berozegaar besahaara maare-maare phir rahe hai
 The West Bengal Service Commission was merged with the Best Bengal Public Service Commission
 pehle adhikariyon or karmchaariyon kii bhartee ke liye alag-alag ayog hote the, ab vahaan ek hi he
 The ongoing agitation for the reinstatement of teachers in Malda district has been over 25 days but no one is listening to them and they send us constant messages
 isi tarah 7 march ko madrasa ke shikshakon ne kolkata main ek pradarshan kiya
 Even before this, we have agitated many times
 inaki pareshaani kaa alam ye he ki wo inhen bengal se hamaare enditivi karyaalay le ai
 The file of documents in the bag has become thick while struggling
 ye log supreme court main bhi cese lard rahe hai
 He told that the West Bengal Madrasa Service Commission was formed in 2008, there are 614 government aided madrasa schools under it

 294 mlas and 42 mps have written letters for them

 The management committee wanted it to retain the right of reinstatement as per Article 30 of the Constitution
 shikshak kehete hai ki prabandhan pehle manamaane tareeke se behaal karata tha
 His merit list has been made after the competition on his reinstatement from the Commission
 madrason kii prabandhan samiti or madrasa sarvice kamishan kii kanoonee ladaai me in shikshakon kaa bhavishya daanv par he
 Because on 12 March 2014 the High Court ordered that the Madrasa Service Commission is illegal
 kamishan ko kaha ki wo kisi prakaar kii niyukti na kare
 The Division Bench of the Kolkata High Court also held that the Madrasa Selection Commission is illegal and the restorations made by it are also illegal
 is aadesh se pehle behaal ho chuke 12,000 shikshakon par talwaar latak gai he
 Now two years ago, the Supreme Court stayed the High Court ruling and said that the result should be removed
 antim faisla nahin aayaa
 Since then, the High Court is sometimes running the Supreme Court
 supreme court main agali taarikh 4 april ko padi he
 We do not even know what are the rights of the Madrasa Management Committee or the people whose lives are being affected by the dissolution of the Madrasa Selection Commission, people are contacting us themselves, which we would put before you after a little investigation Huh
 hamen lagata tha ki hamaare bataane main koi chook hogi, magar abhi tak kisi bhi chayan ayog ne ye tak nahin kaha ki hamaari baat kis had tak galat he
 Everyone is waiting for the job series to stop soon so that everything will continue the same

 After that, they have been waiting for joining for four and a half months
 in chaatro kaa kahana he ki unhen koi bataa nahin rahaa ki kab jwining hogi
 You will not believe that by passing the examination, even after coming on the merit list, these youngsters are sitting at home

 1000 students selected for Assistant Audit Officer for CAG are waiting for joining after passing SSC examination
 esessisiechaesel 2015 kii pariksha paas kar department of industrial policy and promotion (dipp) main jwining ke liye 24 chaatr 7 maheene se intazaar kar rahe hai

 At times, it seems that the government does not want to be reinstated, recruitments are removed when elections come and after that they are sometimes stuck in the name of copying court
 kya computer shikshak ke liye bhi bied kii degree anivaary hoti he, iskaa hamen kuch pataa nahin magar upi main 15 march ko alti grad ke 1500 computer shikshakon kii bahaali ai he usamen bied kii shart he
 It is not right for the students to say

 We have no opinion on this, just keeping it here as information
 in chaatro kaa kahana he ki kendriya vidhyalay sanghathan, navoday vidhyalay or sena ke skulon main computer ke shikshake liye bied nahin hota he
 Often i have seen that restoration comes but sometimes new new conditions are added so that no one is found

 chaatr khud bataate hai ki 40,000 se adhik chaatr jepi uniwarsity ke chakkar main fanse hai
 Now, if 40,000 students cannot solve their problem together, then it should be understood that they and their family also do not want to pass BA before ten or twenty years

 a student of the 2016-19 batch here said that not a single year examination has been done so far

 In fact, ever since the exercise of the Grand Alliance against the Modi government at the Center has started, BJP leaders have been saying in various forums and media discussions that all parties have become one to defeat Prime Minister Modi
 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ko bijepi ''modi vs ol" kah kar prachaarit kar rahi he
 But the first question is, how much is the truth in this picture of "modi vs All"? Will the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in the entire country be based on "modi vs All"? The photo of the opposition's Maharali in Kolkata on Saturday once again reinforced the idea
 lekin yah kahani do tathyon ko chhipaati hui dekhi ja sakati he
 The first is that elections at the national level in the parliamentary system are the result of elections being fought at the state level
 doosraa yah ki rajyon main gathbandhan kaa bijepi ko bhi utana hi phayda mila he, jitna uske vipakshi dalon ko
 Recall during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, ahead of modi-shah's social engineering formula, all the small regional parties were ready for an alliance with BJP
 iskaa sthaneey str par bijepi ko phayda hua or centre main prachand bahumat ke saath bijepi kii sarkaar bani
 But if we look at the situation of different states from Kashmir to Kanyakumari in the political arena of 2019, the reality behind "modi vs All" becomes clear
 uttar pradesh-80 sitsiton ke lihaaj se desh ke sabase bade soobe uttar pradesh main hue pichley aam chunaav main bijepi, apana dal or om prakaash rajbhar kii party ke bich gathbandhan tha
 At the same time, both these parties are still standing with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in terms of upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 to duusari taraf sapa-basapa-areldi kaa gathbandhan he
 While the Congress is contesting alone
 aise main upi main do tarah ke gathbandhan aamane-saamne khadey hai or agar koi akelaa khilaadi he to wo congress he na ki bijepi
 Bihar-40 seat: If you look at the political reality of the other big state Bihar, the BJP has announced an alliance with Nitish Kumar's JDU and Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP in the upcoming elections here
 yahi nahin bijepi ne yahaan 2 saansadon vaali jediu ko 17 siten di hai
 Whereas the Congress, Lalu Yadav's RJD, Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustan Awam Morcha, Sharad Yadav's Loktantrik Janata Dal and Left parties are in front of the NDA alliance
 lihaaja yahaan bhi chunaav modi vs ol nahin, balki gathbandhan banaam gathbandhan hona he
 Maharashtra-48 seat Maharashtra also has a contest between the pre-determined coalition parties in the upcoming elections, as it was in 2014
 jahaan ek taraf bijepi-shivasena he, to duusari taraf congress-ensipi
 Though the Shiv Sena has been an aggressor for the past few days over the BJP and Prime Minister Modi, the two parties can retain the alliance to stop the congress-ncp

 The ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu-39 Seethamilanadu is considered an ally of the Modi government at the Center and is expected to contest elections in alliance with the new entourage of film star Rajinikanth
 haalanki ediemke ne haal main teen talaak vidheyak ke mudde par modi sarkaar kaa virodh kiya tha
 On the other hand, DMK Congress is an alliance of Left parties and it is believed that the new party of film star Kamal Haasan will also join this alliance
 is lihaaj tamilnadu main bhi muqabla gathbandhan banaam gathbandhan yaa gathbandhan banaam ediemke banaam bijepi hone ke asaar hai na ki modi vs ol
 In the Kerala-20 seatcare, the Left has a coalition of LDF and on the other side the UDF is standing under the leadership of the Congress, while the third angle is of the BJP alliance
 or yah teenon ek duusare ke khilaaf lard rahe hai
 So even Modi vs All is not here
 karnataka-29 sitdesh main karnataka hi aisa rajya he jahaan yah kaha ja saktaa he ki yahaan muqabla modi banaam gathbandhan he
 Here the Congress and JDS, who fought alone in the assembly elections, are running a government together to stop the BJP
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki dono dal loksabhaa kaa chunaav saath ladenge
 Talking about eight states of Northeast-25 seats, the BJP or its allies regional parties are also in power here
 siton ke lihaaj se purvottar ke sabase bade rajya assam main bijepi-bodo pipuls front kaa gathbandhan banaam assam gana parishad banaam congress banaam badaruddin ajmal kii ol india democratic front ke bich muqabla he
 The Assam Gana Parishad has been a BJP ally before, but withdrew support for the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 jabaki badaruddin ajmal congress ke saath gathbandhan kii baat kah chuke hai
 The National People's Party, an ally of the BJP, which is running a joint government in Meghalaya and Manipur, has decided to contest the elections alone
 purvottar ke anya rajyon main bijepi kii ladaai yaa to congress se he yaa phir kshetreey dalon se he
 Therefore, there is no scene of Modi vs All here
 madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh-65 sitmadhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main shuru se hi congress or bijepi main sidhaa muqabla rahaa he
 But here too regional parties are contesting separate elections
 haal main hue vidhansabha chunaav main madhya pradesh main sapa, basapa or gondvanaa ganatantr party alag chunaav ladi thim
 In Rajasthan too, the Indian Tribal Party, BSP and Hanuman Beniwal's party contested alone
 jabaki chhattisgarh main ajit jogi kii party or bispi ke bich gathbandhan tha
 Therefore, despite the main contest between the Congress and BJP in these states, regional parties are fighting these two parties
 isliye yahaan bhi modi vs ol kii tasviir banati nahin dikhti
 In Punjab, Haryana, Delhi-30 seats, the Congress stands alone in the small states, on the other hand there is an alliance of bjp-akali and on the other hand, the third angle is of Aam Aadmi Party
 isliye yahaan kaa muqabla kanges banaam bijepi-akali banaam AAP hoga na ki modi vs ol
 Talking about Delhi, here too the Congress, BJP and Aam Aadmi Party are seen fighting with each other
 jabaki haryana kaa muqabla trikoniya he jisame-congress, bijepi or ieneldi ke bich muqabla he
 So how did this match Modi vs All? dakshin africa ke johannesburg se ek ajeebogareeb khabar he

 For the first time, 2 English medium schools have been started in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation

 jabaki doosraa skool shuru hua he shahar ke danilimda ilaake main jahaan padhanevaale bahutayat bachche muslim hai, or yahaan kaa ganavesh he hare rang kaa
 It is alleged that BJP is stereotyping students in schools as well, so saffron for Hindu children and green uniform for Muslim children has been prepared
 mahatvapurn he ki gujarati madhyam ke sabhi skulon main ganavesh nile rang kaa he
 In such a situation, the severity of the allegations has increased due to such different dress in English middle school
 congress ne iskaa virodh karte hue kaha he ki bacchon main bhi sampradayikta bhawan khadaa karne kii ye koshish he jiske saamne wo andolan karenge or skool board adhyaksh ke istife kii maang karenge
 Some parents have made this decision, but they are not speaking openly because they are afraid that children may be discriminated against due to this
 jabaki kuch adhyaaapak kah rahe hai ki dress ke rang kii chunaav prakriya main wo bhi bhagidaar the or isamen koi raajnneeti nahin he
 But time and again the BJP administration is facing allegations of giving communal color, which can increase their difficulties
