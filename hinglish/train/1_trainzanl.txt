 haalanki mohammad caff is maamle main bhaagyashaalee rahe jinhen do baar nazarandaaj kiye jane ke baad royal chalangers bangalore ne ek lakh 30 hajaar dollar kii boli lagaakar kharida
 Ganguly made headlines for Sunday's bid
 puure din ye atakalein hawa main tairti raheen ki ganguli ko duusari baar kii nilaamee main koi ek frenchiji kharid sakati he
 But Ganguly was not included in the 28 players whose names were re-auctioned at the request of the franchisees
 duusari baar kii nilaamee main murali karthik ko sahaara pune varirs ne chaar lakh dollar kii boli lagaakar kharid liya
 It is an embarrassment for India's most successful captain Ganguly as he has continued his cricketing career only to play in the IPL
 vaise ganguli par boli nahin lagane kaa ek kaaran unka aadhaar mulya :chaar lakh dollar: ho saktaa he kyonki jab nilaamee main duusari baar naam pukaare gayi tab tak yah saaf ho gaya tha ki unki puraani team keker unki boli nahin lagaayegi kyonki uske paas keval sava chaar lakh dollars bache the
 Franchises are now set to spend their remaining amount on domestic players

 Even if the Prime Minister (PM Narendra Modi) has said that who will become a minister in the government, do not speculate on it

 isi jashn ke dauraan bataaya ki vah neuyork main rah rahe apane ek dost ko pasand karti hai or unhen date karnaa chaahati hai

 lekin mujhe abhi kuch bhi nahin pataa ki kya hone vaala he

 So where do i have time to date? 'kangana has previously dated Shekhar Suman's son, Study Suman and a UK doctor Nicholas Lafferty
 aaj unki khyaati sabase zyada unki kitaab da rilactent fundamentlist kii vajah se he
 The book was the sharpest commentary on the changed world after the 9 / 11 incident, which was nominated for the Booker Awards, being an international bestseller
 mira nair ne is par 2012 main film bhi banaai thi
 Nearly 20 years later, Mohsin Hamid's first novel, Moth Smoke, created a tremendous stir in India, Pakistan and the literary world
 ise bukar yaa pulitzer to nahin mila lekin kuch pratishthit puraskaron ke liye namit kiya gaya
 There were solid reactions to the novel's freshness and tightness
 mohsin kehete hai, ''pakistan main log kah rahe hai ki ab tak kii sabase ahm kitaab unke liye moth smoke he
 i would say that it is the same in India
 "yah baat marke kii he
 Moth Smoke is the story of a banker from Lahore who later becomes Ayyash
 pakistan main janme mohsin is pustak ke saath hi islam, vaishvikaran or samual hantington ke kathan ''flash of civillineeshans" ke sambandh main sarvaadhik vichaarvaan or aakarshak awaajon main shumaar hai
 For this reason, his books have become more important but they lack the South Asian element
 bregsit or donald trump ke udbhav se pehle likhi unki kitaab agsit west march main prakashit hui he, lekin usamen ek baar bhi pakistan kaa zikr nahin he, jahaan ve apni patni or beti ke saath 2009 se hi rah rahe hai
 He moved from London to Lahore after the birth of his daughter, another reason behind this being his solidarity with that part of humanity stricken by the struggle of the civilizations of Huntington, so that he would be able to maintain his "more equitable and tolerant Pakistan"
 So that we can show our commitment
 vaise ve nirvaasan main hi jindagi katate rahe
 This sense of rootless identity is evident in all his novels
 hamid spasht karte hai, ''main vibhinn samskritiyon main palaa-badha shaks hum
 "he spent his childhood in California
 unhone lahore american skool main padhai kii or america chale aae jahaan princeton or harvard lau skool main ucch shiksha grahan kii
 He says, "I am constantly trying to test things and craft them in new forms
" main numaaindgi main vishwaas nahin karata or kisi kii numaaindgi nahin karnaa chahta
 "despite his reluctance, all his novels focus on the struggle of either Muslims, South Asians, or what he calls the" Global South's Resident "
 pashchim ke pathakon ke samaksh ve jis rup main in masalon ko rakhte hai, kah sakate hai ki jhumpa lahidi yaa salmaan rushdi kii kritiyon ke bainks aanshik rup se vah thodaa alag hota he
 Mohsin's novels are written in opposition to a traditional belief: they would have voiced the typical American question of "why do they hate us?" Or the craze of economic growth in globalization or the notion of a migrant being second-rate
 Huh
 mohsin darasal in vajani sawaalon ko pratyaksh or paroksh, donon tareeke se sambodhit karte haih ve ek spasht agenda saamne rakhte hai or sachetan rup se use kamatar karte jate hai
 In this sequence, they avoid making their characters mere puppets or pieces
 moth smoke ke sukhwad se lekar haau tu get fildi rich in rising asia ke atmopadeshak bayanon tak or pahchaan ke sankat se yukt agsit west ke sutaradhar tak unki sabhi pustaken khud mohsin ke shabdon main kahen to ''vierd" yani ajeebogareeb hai
 One thing to note
 ve maanate hai ki ye saare aakhyaan prem kathaayen hai
 In the exit west, such portals suddenly open, with the help of which migrant refugees are able to travel from Damascus or Lagos to London or New York quite easily
 is bare main ve ek baat kehete hai, ''mujhe lagata he ki nae bhavishya kii kalpana karnaa hamaare liye bahut jaruri he, khaskar is nirashaavadi daur main jab hamaari raajnneeti main nostalgia kii itani zyada ahmiyat ho gai he
 "they also say," a political workload of art may be to envision a future that is not nostalgic and to arouse hope

 chini or bhartiya senaayen aankh se aankh milakar khadi thim, us jagah jo sambhawatah duniya kaa sabase asthir konaa he
 It began when the Chinese started building a road in the area that both China and Bhutan claim
 aakhirkaar donon pakshon ne vivaadit pathaar se peeche hatane kaa nirnay kiya
 But was it hardly a border issue for China
 par yah takaraav hamen bataata he ki china or bharat kaa antarrashtriya kanoon ke mutabik sandhiyon or baadhyataaon ke maamle main ravaiya kitna alag he
 China refers to the 1890 Sikkim Boundary Agreement, signed in 1959 with Jawaharlal Nehru, stating that it demarcates the border between Sikkim and Tibet and later demarcated in 1895
 is prakaar sikkim or tibet kshetra kii seemaa ke bare main koi vivaad hi nahin
 It seems logical but the Chinese did not mention what Nehru said in the next line — it is only about north Sikkim, not the triangle that Bhutan and Sikkim have to discuss and which Today it has become a controversial field
 28 aktubar ko honkong ke akhbaar south china morning post ne peter neville-hedli kaa ek lekh chapa jiske sheershak kaa aashay tha ki 'aitihaasik samjhauton ke sammaan ke maamle main china kaa record meetha gapp, kadava thu vaala kyon he?' hedli ne is maamle main doklam kaa ullekh kiya
 Surprisingly, he quoted the statement of Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, in which he described the 1984 sino-british declaration as a historical document that "has no practical meaning
" 
 
 isamen aisi koi badhyakaari takat bhi nahin he ki china ko honkong kaa prashasan kis tarah se chalaanaa he
 Hong Kong was ceded under Chinese rule in 1997 under this agreement, but was allowed to maintain autonomous government and internal independence for the next 50 years
 ab china kah rahaa he ki yah samjhauta amaanya he or china ko jo acha lage vah honkong main kar saktaa he
 Certainly the Tibetans will remember one such agreement with China, which was signed by their government in 1951
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki ''tibeti janata ko china janavaadee ganraajya kii mathrubhumi ke parivaar main waapas aana chahie
 
 
 Central power will not tamper with the existing political system of Tibet
 ''jaise hi is samjhaute par dastakhat hua, chini sena ne tibet ko apane kabje main le liya, usne 1959 main apane shashan ke khilaaf hui janakranti ko kuchal diya or iske baad dalai lamas ko bharat main sharan leni padi
 The issue is not that China does not respect any of the signed treaties or agreements, it only respects the points it wants to honor, and lumps the rest
 jin puraane samjhauton ko china pasand nahin karata unhen 'asmaan samjhautay bataa detaa he or isliye uske hisaab se inkaa sammaan karne kii koi vajah nahin hoti
 Many recent international decisions that have not been favorable to China, he described as "meddling in China's international affairs"
 isliye yah myne nahin rakhata ki nehru ne 1959 main sikkim or tibet ke bich seemaa vivaad ke bare main kya kaha tha
 Then why this mess? Perhaps for China it is not just the border or any road
 yah baat saaf hoti ja rahi he ki yah china kaa ek raajnneetik kadam tha, bharat or bhutan ke bich khai banane kii koshish
 China had never claimed that it would build a road in this area of its alleged occupation 'for centuries'
 sach to yah he ki samvedansheel nirmaan kii baat us vakt saamne ai jab china padosi desh bhutan se pinge badhaane kii koshish kar rahaa tha, ekmaatr aisa padosi desh jiske saath china kaa abhi tak rajanyik sambandh nahin ban paaya he
 This monarchical country of the Himalayas is connected to India through agreements with British colonial rule in 1910 and independent India in 1949 and 2007
 pehle do samjhauton ke jariye bhutan ko ucch str kii aantarik swaittata di gai, lekin uske videshi sambandhon main bharat kaa maargdarshan chalata rahaa, jisaki vajah se vah ek tarah se bharat kaa sangrakshit desh bana hua tha
 The 2007 agreement gave Bhutan more independence in foreign affairs
 bhutan main bharat ke asar ko kam karne kii koshish ke tahat china ne apni paaramparik 'soft diplomaisi' vaali niti apanaai
 Recently Chinese circus artists, nuts and football players traveled to Bhutan and many Bhutanese students were awarded scholarships to study in China
 paryaton kaa bhi vistaar kiya gaya
 Until a decade ago, only 19 Chinese tourists had visited Bhutan, but today the condition is that 9,000 Chinese tourists visit Bhutan every year, this is about 19 percent of the total tourists coming from those countries

 Chinese intervention at the border forced India to intervene, which was perhaps not fully welcomed by the Bhutanese, as they wanted to show the rest of the world that they were a free country
 china ne isko bhunaane main der nahin kii
 On 2 August, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement in Beijing that, "the issue of china-bhutan border is between China and Bhutan
" iskaa bharat se koi lenaa-dena nahin
 India has no right to place regional demands on behalf of Bhutan
 '' chini videsh mantralay ne kaha ki bharat ne na sirf ''chini samprabhutaa kaa ulanghan kiya he, balki isane bhutan kii samprabhutaa or swadhinata ko chunauti di he
 "thus China plays the card of the old settlement and the overlapping territorial claims when it needs to make changes in the geo-strategic situation, and being caught in this trap and manipulating their interpretation proves to be a mistake
" Will be
 bharat or china ke bich tathakthith seemaa vivaad ko bhi isi roshni main dekhnaa hoga
 China's old stand has been that — to which it has changed many times in recent years — the Line of Actual Control should be considered a boundary
 china ke paas aksai chin he or bharat ke paas arunachal
 No one will oppose such a deal in China, because no one can
 lekin bharat ek aisa loktantr he, jahaan netaaon ko phir se chun kar aana hota he
 For any politician to agree on such a deal would be politically suicidal

 He wants a strategic stability that can be used for his own benefit
 bharat or china ke bich baari dwipaksheeya vyapaar ko dekhte hue ab 1962 jaisaa yuddh hone kii ashanka nahin he
 But China can use the unresolved border issue whenever it can, as it has done to establish its influence in Bhutan
 yaa bharat dwaara china ke kai lakh karod dollar vaale belt and road infrastracchar vikaas kaarykram main shaamil hone se inkaar karne par apni naaraazgi dikhaane par kar saktaa he

 It seems a bit complicated to say that the continuation of the dispute in the border plateau in the Himalayas is favorable for these ostentatious plans of China
 par sach yah he ki uske liye masalaa kabhi bhi seemaa nahin rahaa
 So, in 2018 the war will not be exactly like it was in 1962
 isi tarah china ko bhi apane seemaa vivaad nibatane kii koi jaldi nahin he
 China has its own way of managing foreign relations — in which no established pattern or internationally accepted norm is used

 But NGO President Dhanesh Ishadhan, who was also arguing on his own, remained adamant
 unhone kaha ki 2014 main supreme court ne unki yachika par sabhi rajyon ko notice jari kiya tha
 He was asked for an answer on giving separate place to street vendors

 It is worth noting that even at that time, the IB did not have any evidence or indication that a woman was involved with the terrorists

 a division bench of Justice m Satyanarayanan and Justice n Seshasayee, however, made it clear that the state would have to follow all the existing rules in the context of imposing such banners
 peeth ne yah bhi kaha ki kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ko is tarah ke binar lagane kii ijaajat nahin hogi
 The state government had on Tuesday requested the court to grant permission in this regard to place the banner before the meeting between Modi and Xi Chinfing to be held in Mallapuram

 He said that the state and central governments had proposed to put banners at certain places to welcome top dignitaries, on which the petitioner had requested the court to give a suitable order on this proposal

 isse pehle adaalat ne 23 varshiya ejeeniyar subhashri kii maut ke baad avaidh hording ko lagane ke khilaaf ek yachika par sunwaayee karte hue rajya sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaayi thi
 Taking a tough stand against illegal billboards, the court expressed surprise, "how many liters of blood is needed by the state government to paint the streets with blood
" ''if you act as a pioneer in taking the first step to put an end to this haphazard banner culture, it will reflect your concern towards the sentiments of Thamizhians, and that in itself will garner you the greatest publicity possible

 After his death, the political parties had ordered their respective cadres not to put up such hoardings and banners after the outrage

 haalanki ye experiment level kaa he or philhal ye nahin kaha ja saktaa ki ise company launch karegi hi
 If the device is being designed according to the patent, then we can say that the company can bring a smartphone with a screen that users can drag and enlarge or shrink slightly if needed
 report ke mutabik alji ne yah bhi kaha he ki is tarah kii disple main grip sencig unit ke saath sensor lagaaya gaya he or ye yugers ke bihaviour ko samajhegaa
 For example, if the user pulls the screen of a particular place while watching the video, then later the screen will expand while watching the video by itself
 gauratlab he ki alji ne mobile world congress ke dauraan ek smartphone shokes kiya jisamen do screen atech thi
 The display is not foldable, but it can be called a foldable phone
 khaas baat ye he ki donon hi disple ko said bai said yuj kiya ja saktaa he or is phone main 5G connactivity bhi he

 dilli uniwarsity ke post graduate, emphil or piechdi course main daakhila lene ke icchhuk ummidavaaron ko online madhyam se pravesh pariksha deni hogi
 This time the students will be selected on the basis of computer based test
 bataa den ki uniwarsity kai saalon se online pariksha karwaane kii koshish kar rahi he, lekin is baar vishvavidhyalay kii ore se ise manjuuri mil gai he
 Even before, Delhi University was in the process of getting an online entrance test for the post graduation course, but it was not successful
 is baar farvari main uniwarsity kii admician kamity ne tay kiya ki 70 se zyada course ke liye deshbhar main entrens test minial ke bajaay online yani computer besd hoga
 However, the university's student unions may oppose it before the final seal is made, which can make it difficult to apply the pattern of online examination
 DU: jaane kab se shuru honge 9 under graduate corcej ke liye entrens testareports ke anusaar chaatro kaa kahana he ki admician process se kuch din pehle hi itane bade badlaav se students khaskar pichde ilaakon ke liye mushkil hogi or kharch bhi bad jayega
 In fact, last year too, this decision was stopped due to the students' protest
 haalanki is baar farvari main hi vishvavidhyalay ne isaki bhoomika taiyaar kar lee thi
 Beaten fellow student in du's college, said- 'tum up-bihar, not here, this time the university has set online mode of entrance in 18 cities for all PG, Entrance based UG, mphil and phd programs

 kya uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke helicopter ne mamata banerjee ke pratirodh ko dhata bataa kar mangalvaar ko pashchim bengal main pravesh kiya? 'amit shah phans' naam ke fasebuk pej ne buudhvaar ko helicopter ke land hone se judaa ek video post kiya
 Together it was claimed - 'yogi Adityanath's helicopter entry in Bengal
 ' is fasebuk pej ke paanch lakh se zyada folbers hai
 India Today Fact Check (afwa-anti-fake News War Room) found that this claim is completely false
 yogi adityanath ke helicopter ne mangalvaar ko bengal main pravesh hi nahin kiya
 This viral video is a year old when Yogi went to Tripura for campaigning
 teen minute lambevideomen dikhaaya gaya he ki helicopter kisi duurastha gaanv main bane asthaayee helipad par utarataa he
 Then Yogi comes out and leaves by car and some BJP supporters welcome him
 is post ko report likhe jane tak 1,500 se adhik baar share kiya ja chukaa he or ek lakh se adhik log is video ko dekh chuke hai
 Assuming the viral post was correct, many users on Facebook applauded Yogi for reaching West Bengal by helicopter, ignoring the resistance of the anti-political rival Mamata Banerjee
 kuch media sansthanone report kiya ki pashchim bengal sarkaar ne yogi ke helicopter ko rajya main kahin bhi landing kii ijaajat nahin di thi, isliye yogi sadak ke raste bokaro se raily ke nirdhaarit sthal purulia pahunche
 We watched each frame of the video closely as the viral claim seemed suspicious
 hamane dekha ki yogi adityanath video main jis car main dikhe uski number plate ‘TR’ se shuru hoti he
 This is not the registration number of Tripura but of West Bengal
 hamane yogi ke kafile main maujuud payalat car or fire brigade vine par bhi ‘tripura’likhaa dekha
 In several newspaper reports, we found that Yogi Adityanath had reached Tripura during the campaigning for the Tripura Assembly elections last year
 'da financial express'ne report kiya ki tripura ke do din ke daure par yogi dharmanagar, kanchanpur or jubrajnagar pahunche
 When we searched the youtube video with the keywords 'yogi Adityanath Dharamnagar copter', the same video was uploaded on 12 February 2018, with the caption 'yogi Adityanath in Kanchanpur' written in it

 aam taur par garmi ke is mausam main logon ko barish kaa intjaar hota he
 People invite clouds to rain in their courtyards
 lekin uttarakhand kii pahadiyon ko ab barish se dar lagata he
 The wind trend suggests that clouds will rain again in the next 48 hours
 mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki chakravaateey hawaaen chalani lagi hai
 These winds combined with the heat of North India have started creating an atmosphere of humidity
 asaar hai ki 24 taarikh se dehradun or kumaun ke ilaake main barish hogi
 And it will continue till the 28th
 kya ek baar phir barasegaa kudarat kaa kahar?is agali barish ke bare main sabase ahm or chintaa kii baat ye he ki ye phir unheen ilaakon main hogi, jahaan pehle hi baari tabaahi ho chuki he
 The biggest impact will be on relief work
 kudarat ke kahar ne uttarakhand ko bebas kar diya, tabah ho gaya kedarnath, patari se utar gaya uttarkashi
 Hundreds of deaths have been reported and thousands of deaths are expected
 raahat ke kaam main sena ke saath-saath vayusena or itibipi ke jawan jute hai
 It is believed that about 40 thousand people are still stranded

 The question is that the fate of 40 thousand innocent lives is so severe that it is not possible to guess
 jahaan saikadon log fanse hon, vahaan ek-ek, do-do karke logon ko nikaalnaa kitna mushkil bharaa he
 Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde has also expressed his compulsion
 unka kahana he ki prabhavit ilaakon main bada helicopter nahin utaar sakate, chote main ek se do log aate hai
 But the question is, how will the lives of 40 thousand people be saved? Army personnel are trying everything possible
 baat 40 hajaar jindagiyon kii he
 Therefore relief work is going on on a war footing
 logon ko nikaalane or surakshit jagahon par le jane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 But the weather is stuck in relief work
 raahat ke kaam main har kadam par mushkil he, har raah kaanton se bhari he
 The Meteorological Department has also warned of rain in the mountains within 48 hours
 phir bhi sena ke jawan ji-jaan se apana kartavya puraa karne main jute hai, kyonki inhen bakhubi pataa he har ek jindagi kii keemat
 Then here is the question of 40 thousand innocent lives

 The winter session of Parliament went in vain due to the uproar over demonetisation
 puure satr ke dauraan is mudde par sansad main koi charchaa nahin hui
 At the same time, many parties involved in the opposition got angry over the meeting of the Congress party delegation with the PM
 jiske chalate 4 partiyon ke saansad raashtrapati se milane nahin pahunche
 Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said after meeting President Pranab Mukherjee on the issue of demonetisation that we have demanded that the issue of demonetisation should be discussed in Parliament
 sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad kisaanon, chote vyapaariyon ko ho rahi samasya kaa mudda bhi uthaaya

 In fact, many parties in the opposition were angered by the Congress party delegation meeting with the PM
 aapako bataa den ki congress dwaara kisaanon kii samasyaon ko lekar piem se milane ke baad, argedy, bispi, samaajawaadee party or ensipi ne congress ke saath raashtrapati se mulaakaat karne se inkaar kar diya
 The demonetisation decision of the Modi government has passed most of the opposition parties in the country
 isi ke maddenjar congress samet desh ke 16 raajnneetik dalon ke netaa raashtrapati pranab mukherjee se shuukravaar ko mulaakaat karne vaale the
 In the Winter Session of Parliament, the opposition was busy in besieging the government on the issue of demonetisation
 desh kii siyasat ke do aise rajya jinke bare main kaha jaataa he ki yahaan kii raajnneeti se desh kii disha or dasha tay hoti he
 This time the Lok Sabha elections were the biggest test of BJP and opposition in these two states
 chunaav se thik pehle jab do dhur virdohi dal sapa or basapa upi main saath aae to usee vakt se kaha jane laga ki is baar bijepi purna bahumat se dur rah jaaegi
 The same thing was being said for NDA not only in UP but also in Bihar, because RJD, Congress, nda's former partner RLSP all came together but the result is in front of everyone
 aaj jo nattejey saamne aa rahe hai usase ek baat tay ho gai he ki bijepi or pradhanmantri modi ne sabhi sameekaran dhwast kar die he
 Not only this, if the politics of these two states is changed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi forever, it will not be wrong
 maaya-akhilesh milakar bhi nahin kar paae kamalupi kii raajnneeti main jaateey ganit par puraa jor rahata he
 This is the math after which it was said that if the SP and BSP have come together, then in many seats, similar BJP cards will be cleared
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main in donon dalon ke pade maton ko joda jane laga
 It was said that the BJP is going to suffer a lot of damage
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main sapa-basapa ko jo vot mila usko jodakar bijepi ke nuksaan kaa aankalan kiya jane laga
 It was being said that if the original vote bank of the SP-BSP, Yadav, Muslim and Jatav combine together, then the figure reaches 43 percent
 yahi nahin upi kii 10 siton par muslim-yadav-dalit kii aabaadi 60 fisadi se bhi adhik he

 37 siton par muslim-yadav-dalit kii aabaadi 50-60 fisadi ke bich he
 Lok Sabha Election Results 2019 LIVE: Watch moment-by-moment updates, however, when the results are coming out, it seems that all equations are seen collapsing ahead of Narendra Modi
 2014 ke mukaable upi main bijepi kii kuch siten ghatati najar aa rahi hai lekin donon dal milakar bhi upi main bijepi ko jo nuksaan karne kaa armaan paale hue the wo kaamyaab nahin hua
 Now that BJP is ahead in 56 seats, one thing can be said clearly that Modi has changed the politics of UP for the time being
 kyonki is baar do dal saath aakar bhi kuch nahin kar paae
 When the exit poll came out before the Grand Alliance flopponies in Bihar, no one was convinced about the speculation about Bihar
 raajnneetik dalon ke netaaon ne to na jane kya kuch kah diya
 The NDA seems to be doing a clean sweep in the trends of Bihar so far
 kisi ko yakeen ho yaa na ho lekin bihar main modi ke karishme se kuch aisa hua jisane sabaki bolti band kar di he
 All ethnic equations have collapsed
 bihar main tejasvi yadav ke netritv main utraa mahagathmbdhan puri tarah se fail ho gaya he
 The RJD, Congress, Upendra Kushwaha and Jitan Ram Manjhi's party, along with other allies of the Grand Alliance, could not harm the NDA even a little more than to beat the NDA
 bijepi bihar main 36 siton par aage he
 Opposition parties continued to attack Prime Minister Modi, but the public has expressed confidence in PM Modi's name

 Former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi has questioned Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as to why the 'muslim Women Abandonment Scheme' run by the state government is full of distinction between Hindu and Muslim women?

 phir bhed bhav kyon? 10 hajaar kii sahaayta raashi ko bhi badhaakar 25 hajaar karne kii jarurat he

 Even after HD Deve Gowda was made the PM, Junior Deve Gowda did not fail, he was dropped
 purv siem ne aage kaha, karnataka kii sarkaar congress ne giraayi he
 i sympathize with Kumaraswamy
 vah jabase siem bane, congress unhen rulaati rahi

 It was a humbling experience! a post shared by Sachin Tendulkar (@sachintendulkar) onmay 20, 2017 at 9:45 am PDT On this occasion, Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa honored Tendulkar with a logo
 tendulkar is dauraan sanyakarmiyon ke parivaar waalon se bhi mili
 Dhanoa praised the film made on Tendulkar's life and said, 'this is a great film
 tendulkar ke cricket khelnaa shuru karne se pehle main vayusena se judaa tha, isliye maine unka puraa kariyar dekha he or yah kaaphi preranadai he
 The Chief of Air Force said that the film is being released on a very important day i
e
 26th May, the day the Air Force took over for the first time during the Kargil War
 'tendulkar ne is dauraan bhartiya sashastr senaaon ke karmiyon or unke parivaar waalon ko dhanyavad dete hue kaha, 'isi manch par mujhe bhartiya vayusena kaa maanad group captain banaaya gaya tha

 ' navazuddin siddiki na sirf ek behtareen actor hai, balki achche insaan bhi hai
 He believes in giving importance to the film's story rather than the big name and says that he believes in being a good actor rather than a star
 unki yahi sachai or eemaandaaree hi he, jisaki vajah se ve anya tenlented logon ko aage badhane main puraa sahyog dete rahe hai
 Its latest example is the film 'shorts'
 anuraag kashyap or 'tumbhi' nirmit film 'shorts' main navazuddin ahm role kar rahe hai
 Five different stories in shorts have been directed by five different directors, with Nawazuddin leading the film in a film called Mahfooz
 haalanki is film ke saath badi hi dilachasp kahani judi hui he
 Director Rohit Pandey had followed Nawazuddin to Rickshaw in Benares as he wanted to tell him his story
 navazuddin ne unki is koshish kaa puraa sammaan kiya
 Listened to Rohit's story and they were convinced of Rohit's confidence and agreed to do the film
 is ghatana ke bare main jab navazuddin se poocha gaya to unka kahana tha ki industry main har kisi ko uskaa tallent dikhaane kaa mauka milanaa chahie
 Whatever it is, one has to admit that Nawazuddin's thinking is commendable

 Natwar Singh, in his autobiography One Life Is Not Enough, described himself as innocent in the oil-for-food grain scam
 isi ghotaale ke kaaran 10 saal pehle unka rajnatik vanvaas hua tha
 His claim may seem promising, but the former foreign minister has also pointed his finger at his old party
 ve kehete hai ki congress ko bachaane ke liye unhen bali kaa bakra banaaya gaya
 Saddam Hussein's oil stained Natwar's political life
 puraa ghatnakram kuch is prakaar heru saddaam hossain ke kuwait par hamalaa karne ke baad iraq ke khilaaf lage aarthik pratibandhon se pareshaan aam irakiyon kii madad karne ke liye 1996 main sanyukt raashtra ne tel ke badale anaaj kaarykram shuru kiya
 Under this program grain was to be given in exchange for selling Iraqi oil under the supervision of the United Nations
 60 arab dollar kii is yojana par jald hi gadbaditon ke aarope lagane lage ki saddaam sarkaar paise or rasookh ke liye is kaarykram main ghalmail kar rahi he
 Then UN secretary-general Kofi Annan asked former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to investigate these allegations
 volkar kii 2005 kii report main “gaiyr anubandh vaale labhaarthiyon” ke taur par natwar singh, panthars party ke bhim singh or kuch korporate gharaanon kaa naam liya gaya
 It was alleged that with the help of Natwar, his son Jagat and his friend Andlib Sehgal got 4 million barrels of oil which they illegally sold to a Swiss company, Mesfield AG
 aarope tha ki unhone dallali lee, jise ‘sarcharge’ kaa naam diya gaya
 a part of it is believed to have been delivered to Saddam Hussein's government in Baghdad
 2005 main india today ko die ek intervyuu main us samay kroeshia main rajdoot anil mathraani ne kaha tha ki janvari, 2001 main baghdad yatra ke dauraan natwar singh ne apane bete or sahagal ko iraq sarkaar ke logon se milwayah “moti baat yah he ki isi mulaakaat ke dauraan us len-dein ko hari jhdi mili thi
 The political charge in this sequence was that in return Natwar Singh strongly supported Saddam
 ab natwar singh is maamle main apana daaman saaf karne kii koshish main lage hai
 They ask why the question is not being raised on the Congress, whose name was mentioned in the Volcker report
 ve kehete hai, “agar aap volkar report ke anuchhedon ko dekhen to pataa chalata he ki 1997 main congress party kaa zikr kiya gaya tha
 My name was added in March 2005
 chunki madam sonia ne kaha ki mujhe isamen fansaana he
 ”(see conversation)
 pravartan nideshaalay (idi) kitaab main kiye gaye daavon ko sahi nahin maanata he
 The ED investigated it under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA)
 uskaa kahana he ki saboot singh or sahagal ke shaamil hone kii taraf ishaara karte hai
 The matter is now with the ED tribunal in Delhi
 idi ke kaaran bataao notice main yah aarope tha ki natwar ke paas “sanyukt rup se or kai baar” videshi paisa aayaa
 Total $ 898,027 (5
 4 karod), jo epaieme kaa ulanghan he
 Natwar says that Justice R
 investigating Volcker's allegations
 es
 Pathak had absolved him in the report of the inquiry committee
 yah report pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko saunpi gai thi
 It has not yet been made public
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki natwar apni pustak main justise aar
 s
 pathak ke bare main jo kuch kehete hai or jo bataaya jaataa rahaa he, usamen kaaphi virodhabhas he
 Natwar writes in his book that Pathak "formally submitted his report to the PM on 7 August 2006
 unhone apane nishkarsh main congress party ko puri tarah doshamukt qaraar de diya tha
 "about me," said Natwar Singh, "there is no evidence to show that Natwar Singh took any financial or other personal benefit from the contracts
" ” iske baavjood idi ne “mere bete or mujh par aarope lagaae
 "he writes," Justice Pathak once told me that there was a lot of pressure on him
 unhone mujhase yah bhi kaha ki unhen mere khilaaf kisi bhi vittiya gadabadi kaa saboot nahin mila
 "but the Pathak Committee is believed to have written in its conclusion that" the contracts awarded to Andalib Sehgal and Aditya Khanna (an NRI businessman who are relatives of Natwar Singh and who allegedly drove the money from Mesfield AG to India) , He was the former foreign minister
 natwar singh ke dakhal ke bina sambhav nahin the
 What Natwar Singh has written about his conversation with Justice Pathak in his book can no longer be confirmed, as Justice Pathak died of a heart attack in 2007, a year after submitting his report
 Was
 natwar kaa aarope he ki upie sarkaar kii ore se gathit justise pathak jaanch samiti purvaagrah se grast thiru “31 may, 2006 ko mujhe pathak jaanch samiti ke saamne hajir hone ke liye kaha gaya
 Within five minutes it became clear that the committee was prone to bias
 unhen congress ko sabhi aaropon se doshamukt karne kaa nirdesh diya gaya tha
 The Pathak Committee had said that Sehgal and Khanna allegedly brokered $ 1,46,000 (rs 88 lakh) from two oil contracts
 ) hasil kiye the
 At that time, Hamdan Exports director Sehgal is a childhood friend of Jagat
 samiti ne mana ki sahagal ko ye theke sirf natwar singh ke kaaran mili the or unhone congress ke naam kaa galat istemaal kiya
 ED officials had claimed that during interrogation, Sehgal had confessed to carrying a letter written by Natwar Singh to Iraqi authorities, requesting Hamadan Exports to give oil coupons
 yah sanyog hi tha ki volkar report aane ke do saal baad jagat ne sahagal kii bahan saumya se shaadi kar lee thi
 Surprisingly, Natwar does not talk about his relationship with Sehgal and his letter to Iraqi authorities
 natwar likhte hai ki upie kii purv sarkaar unhen un dastavejon kii jaankaree nahin dena chaahati thi, jinhen vishesh doot virendra dayaal ne sanyukt raashtra se hasil kiya tha
 These documents were about Indian individuals whose names were taken in the Volcker Report
 idi kaa daawa he ki natwar ne kabhi kisi vishesh dastavej kii maang nahin kii or jaanch agency saare dastavej nahin de sakati thi
 Natwar Singh also writes about former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's wavering attitude on documents brought by Special Envoy Dayal to India
 2006 main bangaloru ke ek vakil arun kumaar agarwal kii ore se daakhil artiai ke aavedan ko mukhya soochna ayukta (siisi) ne may, 2013 main khaarij kar diya tha
 The PMO said that it had the documents, but could not be made public
 isse pehle 2006 main piemo ne tatkaaleen mukhya soochna ayukta vajahat habibullah ko bataaya tha ki uske paas dastavej hi nahin hai
 The necessary documents that Dayal brought were not given to Natwar Singh
 dayaal kehete hai, “mujhe nahin maaloom ki ve dastavej pathak samiti ko die gaye yaa nahin
 My task was not to bring only documents related to Natwar or any other, but all the documents mentioned in the Volcker Report
 ” natwar ke nirdosh hone ke daavon ke bare main poochne par dayaal kehete hai, “yah kahana bahut kathin he ki ve is ghotaale main shaamil the
 This is a very subjective matter and my role was quite limited
 ” yani is maamle main abhi or khulaase honge

 ’ Three forms of the Goddess are also specially worshiped in Navratri
 maa lakshmi, maa saraswati or maa kaali
 Goddess Saraswati is worshiped in the middle of Navratri and this worship brings blessings of knowledge, knowledge and wisdom
 iske alaava sangeet kala or aadhyatm kaa aashirwad bhi is kaal main liya ja saktaa he
 If the knowledge in the horoscope is not the sum of wisdom or the barrier of education, then it can be corrected by worshiping Mother Saraswati in Navratri
 kaise karen maa saraswati kii upasna or kin baton kaa khyaal rakhen?- is din pile yaa safed vastra dhaaran karen ,kaale yaa laal vastra nahin
 Then begin the worship by facing east or north
 - yahpujasuryoday ke baad dhai ghante yaa suryaast ke baad ke dhai ghante main karen
 - Must offer yellow and white flowers with white sandalwood to Maa Saraswati
 - prasad main misari, dahi or lava samarpit karen
 - Chant Maa Saraswati kb's mantra "om Aam Namah" or "om Saraswatai Namah"
 - mantra jaap ke baad prasad grahan karen
 What to do if there is a problem of concentration? - Those who have problem of concentration, they should always recite morning from morning
 - buudhvaar ko maa saraswati ko safed phool arpit karen
 To get success in the field of music or art - today ask for saffron and write "ain" on the tongue
 - kisi dharmik vyakti yaa mata se likhavana acha hoga
 What would normally be great to do on the day of Saraswati Puja in Navratri? - In this day, please give a pen to Saraswati and use the same pen throughout the year
 - pile yaa safed vastra jarur dhaaran karen, kaale rang se bachaav karen
 Eat only satvik food and be happy, healthy
 - aaj ke din sphatik kii maala ko abhimantrit karke dhaaran karnaa bhi shreshth parinaam degaa
 Jamaica's Usain Bolt, the world's fastest runner, has spoken out for the first time on the issue that he never consumes banned drugs, and his world, after his fellow athletes former world record holder Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay of the US failed the dope test
 Have to believe this
 samachar patr 'da san' ke mutabik landan diamond meet main hissaa lene pahunche bolt ne buudhvaar ko samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki is puure prakaran ne athletics jagat ko chaunkaaya or isse vah bhi kaaphi aahat hai lekin tamaam vivaadon ke baavjood khel jari rahegaa
 Bolt said, "we should help people forget such incidents
 aisa hona nahin chahie lekin jo hua use bhuulane kii jarurat he
 What can i say more than this? " Asked if people could trust him in this matter, Bolt said, "I knew that this question would come before me
" aap sab 2008 se mere khel ko dekh rahe hai
 If you had been watching my game since 2002, i would have felt that i would have run a great race at that time and set a record
 " "I have been made by God to inspire people to run
 mujhe yah sab tohfe main mila he or main logon ko yahi tohfa de saktaa hum
 i will keep running till my talent is with me
 main apane har kadam se is khel kii madad karnaa chahta hum
 " bolt ne kaha ki doping ko lekar vah kabhi chintaa nahin karte kyonki unhone apane jivan main kabhi jaanboojhkar pratibandhit dawaaon kaa seven nahin kiya he
 The comments bolt bole, "main jaanata hum ki main paak saaf hum or yahi meraa uddeshy he
