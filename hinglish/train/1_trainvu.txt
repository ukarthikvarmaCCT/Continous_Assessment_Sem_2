 In this case, they can be hidden with the help of easy cmake-up tricks
 
 
 - mechap karne se pehle chehre ko acchhee tarah dho len or rooyee main thodaa toner lekar chehre or gardan par lagaaein
 Toning will make your makeup last longer as it keeps your skin dry

 This proves very helpful in hiding the mole
 apni twachaa par samaan rup se foundation lagaaein or is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki til chhip jaae
 - Concealer is one of the oldest and simplest makeup tips to hide mole
 concillar kaa upyog karke aap apane chehre ke lagbhag sabhi kaale dhabbe, til yaa nishaan chipa sakate hai
 However, keep in mind that the foundation and the concealer should have the same color
 - agar aap bahut acha parinaam chaahate hai to yah bahut mahatvapurn he ki concillar or foundation acchhee tarah se milaae jaaen
 If you are applying two layers of concealer then apply some powder before applying the second layer
 - pehle concillar keval do rangon main uplabdh hote the lekin, ab hare, lavendar or yahaan tak ki pile concillar bhi uplabdh hai jo prabhaavshaalee tareeke se aapke tilon ko chhipaane main madad karte hai
 - With a drop of cream concealer, you can do magic on your face
 yah til ko prabhavi dhang se chhipayegaa, chaahe vah kitna hi kaala kyon na ho

 peedita ko mantri ne 18a-civil lines ke nivas par bulaayaa, jo mukhyamantri nivas se mahaj 200 meter kii duuri par he
 Babulal started taking her to the room as soon as the victim arrived
 peedita ke manaa karne par kaha ki meraa parivaar bhi andar hi he, darane kii zarurat nahin he
 Then took him to the inside room in front of the drawing room and told him that your job will be done and started teasing him
 virodh karne par babulal ne kaha ki agar tum raajnneeti main aana chaahati he or aage janaa chaahati he to ye sab to karnaa hi padegaa
 Nothing like this is available
 peedita ne uskaa virodh karnaa shuru kiya to babulal bistar par uthaa- patake shuru kar die, uske saare kapade faad die or daanton se uske sharir ko kaat khaaya
 The minister kept trying till he was defeated
 mahila jab jane lagi to kaha ki kapade sambhaal lo or kisi ko kuch nahin bataanaa, nahin to tumhaara anjaam bhi bhavari devi kii tarah hi hoga
 She then rushed to the Sodala police station in fear, but the police drove her away instead of taking any action

 nagar kii pahachanbabulal nagar kaa janm kanhaiyalaal nagar ke ghar 10 oktober 1960 ko shahpura ke taveri gaanv main ek dalit parivaar main hua tha
 Born in a poor family, Nagar was the first person in his home to teach
 kanoon ke shikanje main fanse nagar ne rajasthan vishwavidhalay se kanoon kii padhai kii he
 Babulal Nagar's political life began with student politics
 sabase pehle ye rajasthan ke rajasthan kalege ke adhyaksh bane, phir pradesh seva dal ke sachiv or phir jila parishad ke sadsy bane
 He became an MLA from Dudu for the first time in 1998 and then won elections in 2003 and 2008
 2008 main chunaav jitne ke baad pehali baar cabinet mantri bane
 He was made the Food and Dairy Minister
 congress main bheed jutau netaa ke rup main pahchaan rahakhanevaale babulal kaa rutaba itnaa bad gaya ki 2011 main pradhanmantri manmohan singh or sonia gandhi ne dudu se aadhaar card kii laanching shuru kii
 Whenever there was a crowd gathering in Jaipur, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot used to depend on him
 yahi vajah thi ki rajya main sarvaadhik bhrasht mantri kahe jane ke baavjood gahalot inhen hataa nahi paae
 Nagar Gehlot was the Dalit face of the government and Sachin Pilot also came to him to win the election
 vivaadit nagarbabulal nagar kaa vivaadon se purana naata rahaa he
 Nagar first came into controversy when his wife Sunita Nagar herself sat in an NGO against him in 2001
 tab gahalot kii sarkaar thi or maamla rato-raat rafa-dfa kiya gaya
 At the time, his wife alleged that she had a relationship with the beauty parlor head
 2002 main unka sitara tab chamakaa jab phaagi ke chakwada main dabangon ne daliton ko talab par nahaane se roak diya tha
 Babulal then became the leader of the Dalits and increased his stature in the Congress
 teesri baar jab dudu se babulal nagar vidhansabha pahunche to ashok gahalot ne inhen khaadya-aapurti evam deyari mantri jaisamalidaar pad diya
 Balulal Nagar was accused of so much corruption that the Supreme Court declared Rajasthan as the country's most corrupt state in the PDS system
 2010 main ek vyakti ne babulal par aarope lagaaya ki maansarovar police se kah kar babulal ne uske haath-paanv tudwa die
 Even then the case was registered on the order of the court, but this time also the minister got the case cleared
 2011 main aarope laga ki naregaa ke paise se or mazdooron se nagar ne apane farm house kii sadak banavaa di
 Then Babulal paid the bill and got rid of him
 uske baad babulal ke khilaaf mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ko chitthee likhi gai, jise gahalot ne jaanch ke liye anti karpshan beuro ko bhej di
 In that he was given a clean cheat saying that the complainant is not being found
 lekin mahipal madarena prakaran ke baad hue mantrimandal main pherbadal ke baad inase khadhya aapurti mantralay chin liya gaya or khaadi mantralay diya gaya
 But near Gehlot, Nagar pleaded what they would do with Khadi, then dairy was also given
 yahaan bhi rajasthan deyari ke chairman or khaadi board ke chairman ke saath chhagadon kii vajah se nagar charchit rahe
 Babulal Nagar himself used to do postings in the area from Thanedar to Constable
 esadm, ediem, tehseeldaar, supplai inspector jaise logon se babulal kabhi sidhi munh baat nahi karte the
 At times, audio cds of Babulal Nagar people abusing and threatening to kill him have also come on the market
 pichley maheene in par aarope laga ki phaagi thane ke thanedaar ne haftaa nahin diya to thane ke consteble se hi pitwa diya
 But due to threatening the officers for the work of the people, they also became famous among the people and for this reason the crowd used to live together

 Aam Aadmi Party convenor and former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal jailed in a case of defamation has written a letter to the people from Tihar jail today
 is chitthee main kejariwal ne kaha he ki unki ladaai bhrashtachar ke khilaaf he or hameshaa jari rahegi
 In this letter, Kejriwal has also written that he is not a criminal and will not fill bail and would prefer to stay in jail
 chitthee main arvind kejariwal ne likhaa he, 'maine bijepi ke purv adhyaksh ke bhrashtachar par sawaal khadaa kiya tha
 He is out, but i am in jail
 mujhe bel lene ko kaha gaya, main bel kyon luun
 i am not a criminal
 mujrim to ye bhrashtachari hai, unhen jamaanat leni chahie
 'this letter has the signature of Kejriwal and reads' Prisoner No
 3642, Jail No
 4, Tihar
 ' Kejriwal's letter was read by senior party leader Manish Sisodia in a meeting of workers
 yah baithak ek sthaneey adaalat dwaara kejariwal kii nyaayik hiraasat kii avadhi 6 june tak badaye jane ke baad party kii ranneeti tay karne ke liye bulaai gai thi
 In the letter, Kejriwal has said, 'there are many defamation cases against me, but none of them asked me for bail because i am not a criminal
 is maamle main, maine sochaa ki mujhe raahat milegi, lekin mujhe jamaanat dene ke bajaay adaalat ne mujhe jail bhej diya
 Now i am in Tihar Jail and questions are arising in my mind that how will the common man fight corruption? He said that in the fight against corruption, he remained hungry, ate police sticks, suffered insults and now 'tihar
 
 '
 chitthee main unhone likhaa he 'meri takat sirf or sirf aap hai
 Please pray for me
 ' party ne logon ko kejariwal ke rukh se avgat karaane or chitthee kii pratiyaan puure shahar main vitarit karne ke liye 'sankalp sabhaayen' karne kaa nirnay kiya he
 Significantly, Kejriwal refused to fill the bail bond even today in the defamation case of Nitin Gadkari, after which the Patiala House Court ordered him to be sent to Tihar Jail again in judicial custody till 6 June
 adaalat ne kaha ki vah pehle ke aadesh ko nahin badalegi or agar kejariwal chahen to ise upree adaalat main chunauti de sakate hai
 On this, Kejriwal has decided to appeal in the Delhi High Court against not getting bail in the lower court
 is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan adaalat ne aaj kejariwal se phir poocha ki unhen muchalaka bharne main kya pareshaani he jabaki yah sirf ek halafanama he
 The court said, for Kejriwal, the court cannot run a separate process
 kejariwal ne ek baar phir nijee muchalaka na bharne kii baat kahi or adaalat se apil kii ki unhen sirf halafname par reeha kiya jaae
 Earlier, the Patiala House Court on Wednesday sent Kejriwal to Tihar Jail for two days in judicial custody after not filling the bail bond of Rs 10,000, after which Aam Aadmi Party supporters demonstrated fiercely outside the Tihar Jail
 
 police ne etiyathan tihaad jail ke aasapaas dhara 144 laga di thi, lekin iske baavjood kejariwal ke samarthak tihaad jail ke baahar dharne par jabaran baithe rahe
 After the arrest of Kejriwal, the Aam Aadmi Party has decided to launch a public awareness campaign against the alleged land scam against former BJP president Nitin Gadkari
 'aap' ne kaha, party kisi bhi aise netaa ko janata kii najar se nahin bachane degi, jo bhrashtachar main shaamil he or vah bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai main apane rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal ke saidhantik rukh ke saath puri tarah khadi rahegi
 Party sources say that a door-to-door campaign against Gadkari has already been started

 gauratlab he ki kendriya mantri shriprakash jaiswal ne ek bayaan dekar siyaasi galiyaaron main halchal machaa di he
 Sriprakash Jaiswal said that if the Congress does not get a majority in UP, then there will be President's rule
 paanchaven charan ke chunaavamein kanpur main apana vot daalane ke baad shriprakash jaiswal ne yah bayaan diya
 Her statement is being interpreted that if the Congress does not get a majority in UP, then it will make a strong effort to take power from the back door
 shriprakash jaiswal ne ek kadam aage badhkar yah bhi kah diya ki agar vidhayak chahen, to ve mukhyamantri banane ko taiyaar he

 The Sky is Pink Review: 'the Sky Is Pink' is based on the true story, and has the heart touching of Aditi Chaudhary (priyanka Chopra), Niren Chaudhary (farhan Akhtar), Ishaan Chaudhary (rohit Saraf) and Ayesha Chaudhary (zaira Wasim) The story is taken
 jise dekhakar jehan main pehali baat yahi aati he ki koi bhi in halaat se na gujarey

 The three-member team has now submitted the 'upcoming Medical Board Opinion' to the police on 30 September

 a day earlier, he had a fight with Pakistani journalist Meher Tarar over his alleged love affair with Tharoor on Twitter

 (inputs bhashaa se bhi) On Monday, a writ petition was filed in the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court challenging the compensation given by the Uttar Pradesh government to the family of the blast accused Khalid Mujahid in Faizabad district court
 saamaajik kaaryakarta nutan thakur dwaara daayar kii kai yachika main kaha gaya he ki chunki khalid aaj bhi sarkari abhilekhon main aatanki he jo ek gambhir aatanki ghatana kaa abhiyukt bataaya gaya

 yadi vah nirdosh fansaaya gaya to use muaavja ke saath aisa karne vaale adhikariyon ke khilaaf bhi vidhik kaarywahi ho, lekin yadi jaanch main paaya jaataa he ki khalid nirdosh nahin fansaaya gaya tha or vastav main is ghantna main sanlipt tha to uske parivaar se muaavja waapas vasula jaae

 On June 29, when four police constables were abducted and reached the Psycho Police Station in Khunti district of Jharkhand, the top police officers had no explanation that at first only three policemen were taken hostage by the tribal mob Why was the matter told
 in constablon ko patthalgadi ke haq main andolan kar rahe 100 se zyada logon kii bheed ne bhaajapa saansad kariya munda ke ghar se agava kar liya tha
 The action was taken after those clashes in Ghaghra village where police raided five women social workers on June 19 in search of four tribals accused of gang rape
 rajya sarkaar jis raste patthalgadi andolan ke nipat rahi he, usamen jahiraa taur par soochna kii gambhir kami he
 According to ancient Pathalgadi tradition, stone pillars are placed on the graves of ancestors
 par agast 2017 se munda ilaakon ke 100 se zyada gaanvon ke adivasee netaa gaanv ke muhaanon par pathar ke takchate laga rahe hai—jin par adivaasiyon ke adhikaar likhe hote hai
 They also do the work of the border which is not allowed to cross the police, administration officers and non-tribals
 patthalgadi andolan ke netaa jahaan daawa karte hai ki jharkhand kaa adivasee ilaaka swatantra ‘dishom’ (raashtra) he, vahiin raghubar das kii sarkaar unhen baatcheet main shaamil karne main naakaam rahi he
 One gruesome result of growing mistrust was gang rape
 police ke mutabik, yah ghatana andolan ke saath maovadiyon ke taar jude hone kii baat kii pushti karti he
 Before the sexual assault, a victim clicked a picture of a man on his phone, Baji Samad alias Takla, Area Commander of the People's Liberation Front of India, a faction separated from the Maoists
 bhaajapa sutron ke mutabik, das apni party ke adivasee netaaon ko bhi baatcheet main shaamil karne se kataraa rahe hai
 There is a sense of 'insecurity' behind it
 bhaajapa netaa arjuna munda teen baar mukhyamantri rah chuke hai or vemunda samudaay ke kaddavar netaa hai
 Officers believe that Arjun Munda can prove to be the best in solving the issue of peg
 par ve das kii sambhavit chunauti ke taur par bhi dekhe jate hai, isliye rajya sarkaar unhen is masale main nahin shaamil karnaa chaahati
 It is only through civil administration and police that the government has contact with the tribals, which is not proving effective
 adivasee jan utthan abhiyaan sareekhee pahalon ko bhi koi khaas kamyaabi nahin mili he
 Says a senior police officer, "government officials neither know the local language nor have any affiliation with the tribals
" aise main yah ummid karnaa ki ve is mudde ko hal kar denge, kuch zyada hi ashaavadi hona he

 Helpline has been issued to end corruption
 jisase wo bhashtrachaar ke khilaaf ladaai ko anjaam tak le ja saken
 But these claims become hollow when his top officials are surrounded by allegations of corruption and the government flatly refuses to order an inquiry against him
 aaj tak ke haath lage kagajaat to ye hi bayaan kar rahe hai
 In 2013, the Anti Corruption Department of the Delhi government exposed scams of the Transport Department worth crores of rupees
 ghapala commercial vaahanon ke fitness jaanch ko lekar he
 In this connection, from 2006 to 2013, the Anti Corruption Department also arrested the small officers of the Transport Department under the rule of the Sheila government, but refused the request when it asked the government's permission to hand over the big officers
 shikayatakarta vivek garg kehete hai, ‘itane saboot hone ke baavjood dilli sarkaar isamen chargeshit ke aadesh nahin de rahi he
 The Anti Corruption Department has been constantly requesting the Delhi government to interrogate former Delhi Chief Secretary PK Tripathi and current Chief Secretary DM Sapolia in the matter
 iske alaava purv transport kamishnar aar chandramohan, purv transport kamishnar aar ke verma, purv adishnal transport kamishnar aar pi meena, joint transport kamishnar wike gupta, purv dipti transport kamishnar ashok gupta, purv dipti transport kamishnar em e osmani, purv dipti transport kamishnar joginder sharma or dipti transport kamishnar je pi sharma ko chargeshit karne kii ijaajat di jaae lekin tab kii dilli sarkaar ne puure maamle ko dabaane kii koshish kii
 Complainant Vivek Garg said, 'the investigation into this scam worth billions has been completed and according to its one-year investigation, Anti Corruption wants to file a charge sheet in this case but these investigations prove the charges of bribery and fraud in court
 Will not be able to do it because the matter is related to top officials of Delhi government and the government is silent
 agar ghoosekhori ke sangeen aarope kisi aam aadmi par lagate to ab tak na jane uske saath kya ho jaataa
 ' dilli vidhansabha chunaav kii siyaasi bisaat bichaai jane lagi he
 Aam Aadmi Party convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is busy in making populist announcements one by one to repair his political fort
 vahiin, dilli main bijepi kii satta main vaapasi kii raah congress ke graph par tiki hui he
 In such a situation, the bjp's strategy is that the graph of Congress in Delhi in the Lok Sabha elections should not be reduced in any case
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav main congress or bijepi kaa graph dilli main badha he, jabaki aam aadmi party (AAP) ke vot fisadi main giravat ai he, jiske chalate congress tisare number se duusare sthaan par pahunch gai he
 The advantage was that the BJP managed to win all the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi
 taaki bachaa rahe congress kaa janadharloksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey par najar daalen to aam aadmi party kaa janaadhar 2014 kii tulana main 2019 main 14 fisadi khiskaa he
 AAP 18 in Delhi
 11 fisadi vot mili hai, jabaki congress kaa 7 fisadi or bijepi kaa 10 fisadi janaadhar dilli main badha he
 22 to Congress
 51 fisadi vot mili hai, lekin vah ek bhi seat jeet nahin saki
 At the same time, BJP 56
 56 fisadi vot ke saath sabhi saaton siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 If sources are to be believed, it is the bjp's effort to not let the Congress's mass base increase in the Lok Sabha elections at any cost
 congress kii majbootee kaa milegaa phaaydabijepi sutron kii maane to congress ko jinda rakhkar hi dilli kaa vidhansabha chunaav jeeta ja saktaa he
 In this context, the BJP is busy implementing its strategy
 bijepi kisi bhi bahaane se congress ko jinda rakhane kii kavayad main jute gai he
 According to BJP strategists, the stronger the Congress, the greater the loss will be to the Aam Aadmi Party
 andruni taur par karenge congress kii madad!aise main iskaa sidhaa phayda bijepi ko aane vaale chunaav main milegaa
 However, under the BJP strategy, along with directly attacking the Aam Aadmi Party, the Congress will also take on its target
 isse yah sandesh jayega ki uske mukaable me congress bhi he
 Not only this, if sources are to be believed, the BJP has also planned to help internally in keeping the Aam Aadmi Party voters in the Lok Sabha elections with the Congress
 darasal, dilli main bijepi kaa voter uske saath jas kaa tas bana hua he, jabaki congress kaa voter hi AAP ke saath gaya he, jiske chalate kejariwal dilli kii satta par kabiz hue hai
 At the same time, in this Lok Sabha, the AAP voter has returned from Kejriwal to the Congress, which the BJP wants to be associated with the Congress
 2013 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey ko dekhen to bijepi 33 fisadi voton ke saath 31 siten jiti thi, jabaki aam aadmi party ko 29
 The Congress had 28 seats with 5 per cent votes and the Congress 24
 6 fisadi vot ke saath 8 siten milin thim
 But, if we look at the result of the assembly elections in 2015, the Congress vote has shifted with Kejriwal
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki aam aadmi party 54
 The BJP managed to win 67 seats with 3 per cent, while BJP got 32
 3 fisadi ke saath 3 siten mili
 At the same time, Congress is only 9
 7 fisadi vot par aakar shunya par simat gai
 It can be clearly understood that the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party's voters in Delhi are the same
 yahi vajah he ki aagaamee dilli ke vidhansabha chunaav main kejariwal apane khiske hue janaadhar ko jahaan waapas laane kii kavayad main jute hai, vahiin bijepi kii ranneeti he ki congress kaa graph jis tarah se majboot hua he vah barkaraar bana rahe

 The first match of the five-match ODI series will be played between Team India and Australia at Chepauk Stadium in Chennai on Sunday 17 September
 is match main viraat brigade 30 saal pehle mili haar kaa badla lene ke makasad se khelegi
 Earlier, the only one-day match between the two teams on this ground was played on 9 October 1987 during the Cricket World Cup tournament

 sibar city gurugram main debit card chloning kaa ek anokhaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 Actually, the miscreants set up cloning devices at a PNB Bank ATM machine in the city
 is divaais ko is tarah se lagaaya gaya tha ki gaur se dekhne ke baad bhi kisi ko shaq naa ho
 Not only this, a plate-like device was also pasted on the pin-inserted keyboard, in which the mirror image would be recorded while inserting the pin
 bank ko chloning ke is frod kii jaankaree 9 april ko lagi, jiske baad aanan-fanan main police ko soochna di gai
 Police reached the spot and took possession of the machine swiping location and the keyboard mounted device
 police ne atm main lage sisitivi camere kii footage ko bhi apane kabje main le liya he, taaki chloning karne vaale in hytech badmaashon kii pahchaan kii ja sake
 The police has registered an FIR in this case of ATM fraud and has started investigation, but the hands of the police regarding the arrest are completely empty
 pienbi bankke atm mashin par chloning ke liye lagaae gaye divaais ke is maamle ne ab bainkon kii suraksha ko lekar kai sawaal khadey kar die hai
 After this case, it has become clear that now you take care not only when swiping a debit card at a restaurant or shop but also while withdrawing money from the ATM, keep in mind that when you swipe the debit card in the slot of the machine, No other similar looking device has been installed above
 saath hi pin ke keyboard kii bhi achche se jaanch kar len

 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr saamana main america ke nae raashtrapati donald trump kii misaal dete hue pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 In fact, Trump had assured people before the election in the US that foreign employees would not be given priority over American citizens
 jisko ab vah amali jama pahanaae jane kii ghoshnaa kar chuke hai
 His statement has become a matter of concern for India
 shivasena ne ye bhi kaha he ki jis tarah trump ne apane desh ke nagarikon ke hit main sochaa he kya aisamodi sarkaarabhi pakistani kalakaaron ke liye is tarah kaa koi kadam uthaa sakati he
 Pakistani artists come to earn money in India
 duniya trump ko murkh kahati he lekin wo apane desh ke liye apni samajhadaari se desh kii raksha ke liye acha kadam uta sakati he to kya modi sarkaar aisa nahin kar sakati?trump kii is karrwai kaa sabase bada jhatka bharat ko lagegaa
 This may cause many Indians to be discharged from America
 lekin saamana main trump kaa paksh lete hue kaha gaya he ki aisa unhone apane desh kii raksha or desh ke hit ke liye kiya he
 It is now to see what role the Modi government of India plays in talking to Trump on this subject
 gauratlab ho ki apana kaarykaal shuru karne se pehle hi apane nagarikon ko khush karne ke liye trump ne jo aashwaasan diya tha uski taiyaari unhone shuru kar di he
 It is being said that Trump has said that those with H-1B visas will not be allowed to work in the US
 aapako bataa den ki ech-1 bi vija wo he jo videshiyon ko america aakar apni visheshta kaa phayda dene ke liye jari kiya jaataa he
 Significantly, Trump has said that employment security of the American people is his priority and he will not allow foreign workers to be hired in place of the American people
 companiyon kaa diya hawalatrump ne digni world or duusari america companiyon kaa hawala diya jahaan bhartiya kamgaaron samet ech1-bi vija par america aae anya videshiyon ne americanyon kii naukariyaan chin leen
 The issue of visas was also prominently raised by Trump during the election campaign and said that he would not allow the employment of the American people for people of any other country
 chunavi campan main diya tha joryova main hajaaron samarthakon ke bich trump ne kaha ki harek america kii jindagi surakshit karne ke liye ve ladenge
 Trump added, "during the campaign i also spent time with American workers who had to train people who were later hired in their place
" unhen hataane ke liye videshi kamgaaron ko laayaa gaya
 We will not allow this to happen at all

 Shammi Kapoor prevailed during those surprisingly difficult years when laughter and optimism were the only guides from an unknown jute mill colony in Bengal to an unpleasant Calcutta filled with every kind of revolution
 kishoravastha ke duusare charan main ummid bhi bahut badi mahatvakanksha lagati he
 Shammi Kapoor was our guide, as he had three essential characteristics of teenagers: he was obsessive; He used to get his glory on his own terms; And the end was always happy
 unhone duniya ko badalane or pyaar ke sapane ke bich ke binduon ko milaayaa
 Love lived in the shadow of real life, with all his hysterical tendencies: in the street shayari of Mushayars in the light of Petromax; In Delhi; And in producing one child after another, which is a clear reality in joint families
 pyaar ke pehle yaa baad ke nattejey ke rup main yon sambandh zyada gopneey tha
 Shammi separates Pyaar from intimacy with fun in a way that clearly indicates the excitement of sex
 vaise, is qaraar main ek suraksha shart judi hui thiah masti yaa chanchalta puri tarah se shaashvat, aantarik, janm-janmaantar ke sachche pyaar kaa lakshan thi
 But even when his heart was broken, his sharp eyelids did not budge, even if there was sadness in the sky
 koun-sa sexophone apane maalik kii seva main isse zyada gamajada rahaa hoga jitna shammi kaa vaadyayantra he duniya usee kii jamaana usee kaa, muhabbat main jo ho gaya ho kisi kaa main lagata he
 His fingers on the piano in Brahmachari showers as if he was responsible for Mumtaz's troubles
 unhone sau se zyada filmon main abhinay kiya lekin mujhe nahin lagata ki punjabi prem katha hir-ranjha un kritiyon kaa hissaa thi
 If Shammi had been Ranjha, he would have kept a grand piano on the banks of the river Ravi and it would have matched the character perfectly
 chalis saal baad us cheekh ko nazarandaaj karnaa aasaan he jo pet se nikali, gale main ai or phir jisane aapke dimag ko uda diyah yahyahyahyahyahyahya! mere liye, swapna naamak khatmal bhare cinema haul main, junglee kii vah cheekh parampara ke bevakoofana ubaaupan se mukti kii aawaaj thi
 Suddenly, the lovers shed a tear as Dilipkumar poured a bucket; Or quit walking with patriotism, which Raj Kapoor considered necessary; Or quit making face like a stomach ache patient, which was Rajendra Kumar's specialty
 jab main 10 saal kaa tha or abhi-abhi boarding skool kii sajaa sunai gai thi tabhi shammi kapur ne hamen bataaya ki jaakar ham apni aawaaj dhundhen, bhale hi vah kabhi-kabhaar kii chillaahat sabit ho
 If you can be, then be talented; If you have to be, then be stupid; But in any case be real
 donon hi roopon main majaa tha, masti thi
 Mohammed Rafi's voice was sung by Shammi
 ve donon milakar himalay jitna aaroh-avaroh napate hai lekin isse bhi sateek dhang se kahen to subah kii khilakhilaati dhoop se lekar shaam kii dhundh or makhmali raat tak safar karte the
 The cap on the head is just one of those countless memorable songs with a red glowing glow
 shammi jab is rang badalati duniya main insaan kii niyat thik nahin, niklaa na karo tum saj dhaj kar imaan kii niyat thik nahin gaate hai to shaam dhalane lagati he
 When Rocky handles the drums on the third floor, the night is in full swing, they beat Balakhati Helen

 nayyar or shaayar hasarat jaipuri kii jamaat ne jab sangeet ke utaar-chadhaav ke saath shabdon ko milaayaa hoga or usamen shammi kapur kaa josh daalaa hoga to kitna majaa aayaa hoga
 Shammi praised the great people who transformed Hindi film songs into brilliant art
 jab talat mahmud ne abhinayta banane kii koshish kii to shammi ne unhen ek samajhdaari bhari salaah di
 "talat saheb, you sing so well
"

 Woodhouse made it popular in his novels
 shammi or rafee ne use tej aawaaj main halakaa bana diya, or usamen sangeet kaa aisa jaadu bhar diya jo aaj bhi dilo-dimag ko usee tarah mast kar detaa he jaise chaar dashak pehle kar detaa tha
 You look again and again, listen a thousand times and listen, and your mind will be disturbed
 agar aap bina machale kisi na kisi se kabhi na kabhi, kahin na kahin dil lagaana padegaa baithe-baithe sun lete hai, to shaayad aap bina dil ke hi paidaa hue honge
 We forgot Shami's obesity, the shocking rise towards the slimy, skiing swimsuit in swimsuit like someone hanging a bathrobe from her belly around her belly; His premature obesity and unnatural acting forgot everything because he taught us a lesson that we needed in those uncertain struggles: Attitude
 alavida, sar! tumne mujhko hansanaa sikhaaya, rone kahoge ro lenge ab

 The bjp's campaigning thrust was that the ruling leadership is weak and wavering, with no decision-making capability
 narendra modi ne khud ko ek drudh or nirnay lene vaale netaa ke taur par pesh kiya
 The BJP also presented itself as a party of hope and change, a party that can fulfill the hopes of the youth
 rahul gandhi or congress ne is aakraamak hamale ke jawaab main khud ko sabko saath lekar chalane vaali or garibon, alpsankhyakon or samaaj ke dabe-kuchle logon ke prati samvedansheel party bataane kii koshish kii
 The Congress party and its allies tried to show that Modi does politics to divide the society, so he cannot become a national leader
 hamaari raay main yah chunaav bharat kii janata ke saamne rakhe gaye inhen do vikalpon par kendrit tha
 The BJP projected itself as a party to bring change
 modi ne khud ko ek aise rashtriya netaa ke taur par pesh kiya, jo puure bharat main vaisaa hi vikaas laa saktaa he jaisaa unhone gujarat main kiya he, yani aarthik vikaas karnaa
 Only a decisive leader like Modi can bring such development
 congress party ne jo chunaav prachaar chalaaya, vah zyada nakaaratmak tha
 He tried to emphasize Modi's divisive politics and his inclusive policy in his campaign
 congress or duusari partiyon ne bhi gujarat ke aarthik vikaas ke model par sawaal khadaa karte hue yah bataane kii koshish kii ki yah vikaas garibon or kisaanon kii keemat par kiya gaya he
 The BJP gave a positive message through a firm leader to show the picture of hope and a golden future, which enabled it to attract voters, while the Congress's negative campaigning failed to woo voters
 ek nirnaayak netritv ke prabhaav ko dikhaane ke liye hamane india today group-sisero neshnal post pole survey ke aankadon kaa istemaal kiya
 This poll was based on the hallmark survey experiment (see box of method for details)
 yah bharat main media-pryojit janamat surveykshanon main apni tarah kaa ek nayaa prayog he
 To know the effect of one factor on another factor, we asked the respondents selected as a hallmark to answer one of the two questions - should the leader be quick to decide or should he be the one to take everyone along, Even if the pace of decision-making is somewhat slow, we find that most Indians prefer a firm and decision-making leader
 83 fisadi uttardaataaon ne kaha ki desh ko nirnay lene vaale netaa kii jarurat he, jabaki keval 69 fisadi kaa maananaa tha ki desh ko sabko saath lekar chalane vaale netaa kii jarurat he
 This figure is shocking because the same trend of response was seen in different caste-communities, places, or women-men
 ek nirnaayak netaa ko pasand karne waalon kaa anupaat samaveshi netaa chaahane vaale logon ke anupaat se kahin zyada tha (dekhen pehla graphic)
 Even most states want a decision-making leader over inclusive leader (see list 1)
 is tarah kii raay vyakt karne vaale rajya hai uttar pradesh, pashchim bengal, gujarat, rajasthan, dilli, tamilnadu, jharkhand, bihar, madhya pradesh, maharashtra, kerala or haryana
 Assam, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Punjab want their leader to be decisive and inclusive, but did not prioritize a more inclusive leader
 orissa or andhra pradesh chaahate hai ki unka netaa nirnayashil ke mukaable zyada samaveshi ho
 Overall, the country created the mood of r or Par this time
 kya ek drudh netaa kii is chaah ke kaaran bijepi ko chunaavon main koi phayda hua? is sawaal kaa jawaab dene ke liye hamane nirnaayak netaa chaahane vaale logon main voting kii sambhaavna kaa anumaan lagane ke liye sankhyikeey modelon kaa istemaal kiya
 The preference for a decisive leader increased bjp's vote by 3 per cent
 kisi bhi maanak se yah ek badi sankhya he, kyonki 2009 se bijepi ke paksh main jhukaav kareeb 12 fisadi he
 a 3 per cent vote in a national election can lead to 50-60 seats
 desh kaa mood nishchit rup se ek nirnayashil netaa ke paksh main tha
 Did the country likewise give priority to the message of hope, change and development? Data from the India Today group-cicero National Post poll shows that voters were influenced by Modi's image
 matadaataaon main unki chhavi unke aalochakon dwaara banaai gai chhavi se bilkul alag thi
 When the respondents were asked if Modi represents the national interest and aspirations of the country, 54 per cent of the people said yes and 52 per cent said that Modi can revive India's growth rate
 purush or mahila, garib or amir, shahari or gramin, sabhi ke man main modi kii acchhee chhavi thi
 Nearly 50 percent of the people said that Modi is good for India and they can speed up the growth in the country again
 duusare shabdon main kahen to modi ke chunaav prachaar ke sandesh ne desh main zyaadaatar logon ko prabhavit kiya, khaskar yuvaaon ko
 Despite this, Modi's message did not affect Muslims and Dalits much (see second graphic)
 congress ke chunaav prachaar kaa kya prabhaav rahaa? kya logon ne modi ko vibhaajankaree raajnneeti se joda? desh main aath main se ek vyakti ne modi ko vibhaajankaree mana or chah logon ne mana ki modi shaayad hi vibhaajan kii raajnneeti karte hai
 To be fair, the Congress's attempt to make Modi a divisive leader did not have as much effect as the public's attempt to arouse Modi's hope
 yani modi kii ummid jagaane kii koshish kaa asar apekshaakrit zyada rahaa
 The only exception to this was the Muslim community
 chaar muslim votaron main se ek kaa maananaa tha ki modi samaaj ko baantne kii raajnneeti karte hai (dekhen teesraa graphic)
 The leadership had a huge and decisive impact on these elections
 bijepi vijayi rahi, kyonki usne ummid or sunaharaa bhavishya dene vaala netritv pesh kiya
 The impact of this message is more clearly seen in those who did not vote for BJP in 2009 and earlier, but voted for BJP in 2014
 is samooh main netritv kaa asar sabase zyada tha
 In 2014, nearly 60% of those who voted for the BJP, excluding the other party, preferred BJP because of Modi's positive message
 is sakaaratmak sandesh kaa sabase zyada asar yuvaaon main dekhne ko mila, jinamein bijepi ko vot dene kii sambhaavna kareeb ek-tihaai bad gai
 No such leader was presented by the Congress, who can lead India towards the golden future
 isaki jagah unke netaa ne modi ko nicha dikhaane kii koshish kii
 The party's strategy failed to woo most of the country's voters
 ummid or drudh netritv kaa sandesh nakaaratmak sandesh par baari padaa
 Young and ambitious India was looking towards a hero
 modi ne khud ko usee rup main pesh kiya
 Most people want a decision-making leader
 bijepi ko isse nishchit rup se phayda hua
 Modi now has to fulfill the expectations of the people, which he has generated himself
 modi apni party yaa sarkaar kii sansthaaon ke peeche nahin chup sakate hai

 This incident has shaken Delhi
 kisi ne kaha he ki siyasat gunjaaish se shuru hoti he or vahiin khatm bhi
 The leaders of Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), who were enemies of each other in Uttar Pradesh, did not like each other
 lekin jab dushman saajha ho, or kaddavar bhi, saath hi ladaai astitv bachaane kii ho, tab to saath aana majubari ban jaataa he
 In the by-elections in Phulpur and Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, all the colors of Gulal are flying in the political arena even after Holi due to the alliance between SP and BSP
 sapa ke saath to or bhi kai dal aa gaye hai
 Rashtriya Lok Dal, Nishad Party and Peace Party have given support to SP
 lekin is gathjod ke bich congress ne khud ko badi ladaai ke liye taiyaar karte hue haashie par khiskaa liya he
 The Congress feels that its candidates in these two seats are so strong that they will single-handedly win the party
 vaise, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko gorakhpur main 4 fisadi or phulpur main 6 fisadi vot mili the
 But adding SP-BSP votes tells some story
 jaahir he, yogi adityanath ke liye upachunaav main muqaabala kuch aasaan nahin rahane vaala
 Election Campaign During the , the war of words has also intensified
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath chunavi sabhaaon main apane virodhiyon ke is gathjod ko saanp or chhachhundar kaa mail bataa rahe hai
 Nevertheless, this situation is not going to be comfortable for the BJP in the statistics game
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main gorakhpur main congress ko mahaj 4 fisad vot hasil hue the
 But SP got 22 and BSP got 17 per cent votes, while BJP got 52 per cent votes
 yani loksabhaa chunaav ke lihaaj se dekhen to gorakhpur main, sapa basapa hi nahin congress ko bhi mila den to bhi bhaajapa kahin zyada oonche machaan par he
 The situation was almost the same in Phulpur Lok Sabha seat
 yahaan bhi bhaajapa ko 52 fisadi vot mili the, or sapa, basapa or congress teen ko milakar 43 fisadi vot hi hote hai
 But since 2014, issues have changed, elections too
 vidhansabha main haalanki bhaajapa ne baaki dalon ko dhul chataa di lekin vot share ke maamle main agar in donon dalon ke voton ko joda jaae to maamla kam se kam spardhapurna to ban hi jaataa he
 There are five legislative seats under Gorakhpur Lok Sabha
 inamen piparich main sapa basapa milakar 47 fisadi vot the, jabaki bhaajapa ko 34 fisadi mili the
 In Sahajanwan, SP-BSP gets 53 per cent votes, BJP got 35 per cent, SP-BSP in Gorakhpur Rural got 47 per cent and BJP got 36 per cent votes
 gorakhpur shahar main sapa, congress ke saath thi isliye yahaan congress ko 28 fisadi vot hasil hue, basapa ko 11 fisadi mat mili the
 The BJP had 39 percent of the vote
 jabaki, campiyarganj main congress 27, basapa 18 bhaajapa ko 43 fisadi vot mili the
 Within the Phulpur Lok Sabha constituency, these five assembly seats are Phaphamau, Saraon, Phulpup, Allahabad West and Allahabad North
 inamen se gathjod ke donon saajhedaaron ko mila den to sabase kam elahabaad pashchim main 51 fisadi or sabase adhik fafamau main 54 fisadi vot hote hai
 While the BJP got the most votes in Allahabad West 43 and 41 percent in Phaphamau
 asal main, basapa ke saath jaakar sapa apane pichhadon or muslimon ke vot bank main daliton khaskar nishadon ke vot jodna chaahati he
 It will be known only after the results, how many votes of the BSP will be transferred to the SP, but we are more interested in whether this alliance formed in fear of the BJP, which will bring the two enemies close, will also remain in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 Meanwhile, yoga guru Ramdev is talking about finding a middle ground in the Ayodhya case on the condition of giving me a place to build a temple in Mecca Medina and Vatican City
 aapako bataa den ki makka madina muslim dharm ke pavitra sthal hai, jabaki vatican city main roman catholic carch he
 On the question of finding a middle ground on the Ram temple case, Ramdev said that in Mecca Medina also the middle path should be found and there we should be given a corner so that we can install the idols of Rama, Krishna and Shiva there
 unhone kaha ki hamako vatican city main bhi ek konaa diya janaa chahie, taaki ham vahaan hanuman kii murti laga saken
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Yogguru Ramdev said that everyone wants to find a middle ground in Ayodhya, but no one is ready to find a middle ground in Mecca Medina and Vatican City
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki pakistan or afghanistan main bhi koi bich kaa rasta nikaalane kii baat nahin karata he
 Ramdev questioned whether all the routes would be taken out in India itself
 Ram, born in Ayodhya, knows the whole world: In response to a question during Ramdev, Yoggururamdev said that Ram temple will be built in Ayodhya
 ham makka madina or vatican city main ram mandir banane kii maang nahin kar rahe hai
 The whole world believes that Rama was born in Ayodhya
 ram hamaare purvaj hai
 Whether someone considers them humans or God
 duniya main sabhi apane purvajon ko sammaan dete hai
 The ancestors will get respect by building Ram temple
 'ram ko bhi milanaa chahie nyaay'yogaguru ne sawaal uthaaya ki ham bahusankhyak hai, to kya hamako nyaay hi nahin milegaa? majahabi taur par kisi tarah kaa faisla karnaa galat he
 He said that the decision should be based on the truth
 ram majahabon se pehle the
 Rama should also get justice
 jab ramdev se kaha gaya ki makka madina menmandirtodakar masjid nahin banaai gai, jabaki ayodhya main babari masjid kaa dhaancha dhahaaya gaya tha, to iske jawaab main unhone kaha ki hindustan main hajaaron-hajaaron mandiron ko todaa gaya
 After this, mosques were built in place of these temples, then all of them should be accounted for
 ramdev bole- kaashi vishwanath main masjid kyon?ramdev ne kaha ki agar sabhi kaa hisaab nahin ho saktaa he, to kuch kaa to hona chahie
 He asked what is the work of the mosque in Kashi Vishwanath? Similarly, what does it mean to build a mosque near Krishna's birthplace in Mathura? It is clear from these mosques that the Mughal emperors had previously committed cruelty on religious grounds
 is bich ramdev ne kaha ki is maamle par bahes shuru karne kii bhi vakaalat kii
 Congress considers Ram to be imaginary: Ramdev also reacted to the statements of Asaduddin Owaisi and Congress against the demand of giving Bharat Ratna to Ramdevvir Savarkar
 unhone kaha, ‘ovaisi majahabi taur par logon ko ladaana chaahate hai
 They do politics of vengeance and hatred
 iske alaava jahaan tak congress kaa sawaal he, to usne ram ko kaalpanik bataaya he
 Former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in the Discovery of India called the Ramayana and Mahabharata as fictional texts and Ram and Krishna as fictional characters, which is extremely objectionable
 congress apane purvajon ko hi bhul gai, jiske chalate uski yah haalat hui he
 The opposition is not even visible at the national level
 vipaksh haadase kaa shikaar ho gaya he
 Ramdev said, "some waivers want to create ideological terrorism
 kuch log dharm or jati ke aadhaar par ladaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Veer Savarkar's entire house and family was destroyed, if he lost for a moment, should he be considered a criminal? He said that talking about Hindutva is a crime? Veer Savarkar was proud of his traditions
 unako bharat ratna milanaa hi chahie

 Following the order issued by the Uttarakhand High Court in August 2018, the Center has paid a compensation of Rs 25,000 to IFS officer Sanjeev Chaturvedi
 adaalat ne is varsh june main avmaananaa notice jari kiya tha
 Chaturvedi had filed a case before the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT)
 chaturvedi ne cat main yah maamla 2015-2016 main ames, nayi dilli dwaara unke moolyankan report main pratikul pravishti karne ko lekar daayar kiya tha, jahaan unhone 2012 se 2016 tak mukhya satarkta adhikari ke taur par kaary kiya
 Kat started hearing the case from July 2017
 cat adhyaksh ne dilli sthit cat kii pradhan peeth main chaturvedi dwaara daayar kaarywahi par roak laga di thi, jo ki nainital main cat kii ek khandpeeth ke samaksh lambit thi
 When Chaturvedi filed an application before the Nainital bench challenging the assessment report, an interim order was passed in his favor
 uske baad centre cat kii pradhan peeth ke paas pahunchaa tha or usase maamle ko nainital se dilli hastantarit karne ko kaha tha
 The CAT chairman had stayed the proceedings pending before a two-member bench in Nainital for six weeks
 cat ne iske saath hi chaturvedi ko ek notice jari kiya tha
 Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer challenged the order of the CAT chairman in the Uttarakhand High Court last year
 adaalat ne cat adhyaksh ke aadesh ko radd kar karte hue kaha tha ki centre or ames kaa rukh adhikari ke khilaaf ‘‘pratishodhi'' tha
 In the same order, the Uttarakhand High Court imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on the Center and AIIMS
 uttarakhand ucch nyaayalay ke is aadesh ko centre or ames ne ucchtam nyaayalay main chunauti di
 In February 2019, the Supreme Court not only upheld the order of the High Court but also ordered that 20 thousand rupees be deposited in the Legal Services Committee of the Supreme Court
 uttarakhand ucch nyaayalay dwaara lagaaye gayi jurmaane kaa bhugtan chaturvedi ko nahin kiya gaya
 In June 2019, the Uttarakhand High Court appointed Union Health Secretary Preeti Sudan and AIIMS Director Dr
 randeep guleria ko avmaananaa notice jari kiye
 In response to this, the Center filed an affidavit before the Uttarakhand High Court on August 5 and apologized "unconditionally and with utmost sincerity" and stated that it was due to the "wrong advice" of his Delhi Advocate that the amount Cannot be paid to Chaturvedi
 adhikari ke naam 25 hajaar rupee kaa bank draft jari kiya gaya
 In one such case, the then state government headed by Bhupendra Singh Hooda in Haryana paid a compensation of Rs 10,000 to Chaturvedi on the orders of the State Information Commission for harassment
