 Kumaraswamy is confident that his party will emerge as a king rather than a kingmaker in the May 12 electoral battle between BJP, Congress and JDS
 purv pradhanmantri ech di devegaudaake putr kumaraswami ne india today ke saath exclusive intervyuu main kaha ki ve 113 siton ke jaadui aankade tak pahunchane ke liye kadi mehnat kar rahe hai or jedies purna bahumat ke saath chunaav jeetegi
 Explain that a majority of 113 seats in the 224-member Karnataka Assembly is required
 kumaraswami ne kaha, ‘ye khokhla daawa nahin he jab main kahata hum mujhe bahumat milegaa
 i am fully convinced
 is vakt karnataka ke log mujhe aashirwad dene ja rahe hai
 He has seen both Siddaramaiah and Yeddyurappa
 ’kya aisi sambhaavna he ki kumaraswami kii siton main itnaa ijapha ho ki ve bahumat ke aankade ko paar kar jaaen? is sawaal ke jawaab main kumaraswami ne kaha, ‘mere liye is baar mauka he
 Last time i lost more than 38 seats due to weak economic condition with a slight margin of 300 to 3000 votes
 is baar hamane beete do chunaavon main hui galatiyon se sabak lete hue faisle liye hai
 Why is Kumarna (kumaraswamy known by his admirers by the same name) so confident that he will prove to be the king while political experts and opinion polls are speculating to be his kingmakers? In response to this question, Kumaraswamy said, 'the whole of Karnataka is not saying that i will be the kingmaker
 darasal log chaahate hai ki agle 5 saal tak rajya main shashan ke liye main king banuun
 Kumaraswamy denied that the JDS is strong only in Old Mysuru, not in the rest of Karnataka
 kumaraswami ne kaha, ‘aisa nahin he, raajnneetik jaankaron kii ore se jedies ke sirf old mysoreu main majboot hone kaa anumaan lagaana galat he
 The reality is that we have strengthened ourselves in North Karnataka as well
 ’ kumaraswami ke mutabik krishi pradhan ye kshetra badahaal he or ye sab rajya or centre sarkaar kii nitiyon kii vajah se he
 Kumaraswamy said, 'most people depend on agriculture

 This time, the farmers are going to vote for the JDS
 ’kumaraswamipahle bijepi ke saath milakar kaam kar chuke hai
 In 2006, he rebelled with his father Deve Gowda and formed a coalition government in Karnataka with the BJP
 jab unase bijepi ke saath kaam karne ke ateet ke anubhav ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone zikr kiya ki kaise us vakt unke dipti siem rahe yediurppa bijepi ko chhodana chaahate the
 Former Chief Minister Kumaraswamy said, 'yeddyurappa wanted to quit BJP
 unhone mujhase kaha tha ki cabinet mantri ke taur par mantrimandal main shaamil kar lo
 Then i advised them not to leave the party or else you would lose your identity
 unke saath kuch vidhayak bhi bijepi chhodana chaahate the
 i advised them to take these mlas in their trust
 wo (yediurppa) meri salaah bhul gaye
 i joined hands with BJP because of pressure from my mlas
 ’kumaraswami ne ye zikr bhi kiya ki kaise bijepi ke ek netaa ne aarope lagaaya tha ki unhone mining agenton se (bellari mining ghotaale ke pramukh abhiyukt ji janardan reddy) 150 karod rupye kii moti ghoose lee thi
 Kumaraswamy said that at that time no BJP leader had come to his rescue
 kumaraswami ne kaha, ‘ve (bijepi netaa) chupchaap dekhte rahe the ki kaise meri chhavi ko kharaab kiya ja rahaa tha
 a BJP minister even alleged that i had given a betel nut to his murder
 main kisi ke saath ab nahin janaa chahta (naa congress ke saath, naa bijepi ke saath)
 According to Kumaraswamy, he had joined hands with the BJP in the past because the Congress wanted to end his party
 congress or bijepi donon hi dushman hai
 Kumaraswamy denied any differences with his father Deve Gowda
 unhone kaha ki kisi bhi sambhavit raajnneetik gathbandhan ko lekar unke pita or unke vichaar ek jaise hai
 Kumaraswamy said, there is no difference
 ham chunaav main ekamat se faisla lenge
 My father is my boss
 devegoda ke is bayaan ki ve or unka parivaar kumaraswami se naata tod lenge agar unhone dobaaraa bijepi ke saath haath milaayaa
 To this, Kumaraswamy said, 12 years ago, the decision i had taken was under political pressure
 unhone (devegoda) wo bayaan us sandarbh main diya ho saktaa he
 But i do not regret that decision because i made that decision to save my party from the Congress
 isane mujhe party ko rajya main majboot banane main madad kii
 But if the JDS does not get a majority, will Kumaraswamy sit at home and is everything not possible in politics? In response to this question, Kumaraswamy said, 'there may be a possibility but we can change it in three days
 ham 113 siton ke jaadui aankade ko hasil karne ke liye kadi mehnat kar rahe hai
 We will get an absolute majority
 ’kumaraswami ne pradhanmantri modi par is baat ke liye prahaar kiya ki ek taraf unhone devegoda kii prashansa kii or phir logon se jedies ko vot dekar apana vot kharaab nahin karne kii apil kii
 Kumaraswamy said that voters of Karnataka are not taking Modi seriously
 kumaraswami ne kaha, ‘main apane mananeey pradhanmantri ko dekhtaa aa rahaa hum
 My rallies attract more people than their rallies
 bijepi raily main aane vaale har vyakti ko 300 se 500 rupye detii he
 We do not need to distribute money to bring people to our rallies

 Doing this will not spoil the eggs and will keep your health as well
 kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne congress dwaara jiesti samaaroh kaa bahishkaar karne par tikhi pratikriya pratikriya dete hue kaha ki congress bhramit or gaiyr-jimmedaar he
 In fact, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi had said in a tweet that GST is being implemented in half-baked form in haste
 notebandi kii tarah hi jiesti ko ek aksham or asamvedansheel sarkaar dwaara sansthagat taiyaari ke bagaiyr lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 Reacting to this, Gadkari said that this is a childish act
 unhone kaha ki purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh or pi

 ab ve use tamaasha kah rahe hai
 This is political compulsion
 " unhone tikhe swar main kaha ki pehle ve jiesti ko apni (congress) dein bataate the lekin ab ve ab uskaa hi virodh kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, the Congress has claimed that in 2011, the then BJP President Nitin Gadkari was ready to support the GST but it was stopped by the then Chief Minister of Gujarat Narendra Modi and Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 puure desh ke vyapaariyon dwaara jiesti kaa virodh kiye jane ke sambandh main sawaal poochne par gadakari ne kaha ki isse unhen phayda hoga or centre tath rajyon ke rajasav main badhotaree hogi

 Now they are calling him a spectacle
 yah raajnneetik baadhyataa he
 "he said sharply that earlier he used to call GST as his (congress) gift, but now he is opposing it only

 Lakhs of paramilitary forces are on the road demanding equal pension and salary like the army, 8000 BTC teachers of UP are sitting on a sit-in waiting to get appointment letters, 4000 Urdu teachers are on the road waiting for appointment letters, along with it
 Two lakh Shiksha Mitras are wandering at the rate of demanding salary from time to time and 10,000 to 40,000, Lekhpal of 75 districts of UP is on strike to increase salary, in tehsils Type of certificate is not created, they all hope that channel shown their story because their moment in mind these problems is the big news
 kitni bhi badi khabar ho jaae inkaa yahi massej aata he ki kya aap aaj hamaare mudde par charchaa nahin karenge
 We cannot discuss it with everyone because we are neither the government nor we have any secretariat, yet this is because of how people are facing problems, and people are missing from the world of news
 kya aapaki nazaron se us hujum kii tasviir kabhi guzari he jab 14 or 15 may ke din lakhanu main 4000 urdu shikshak apni niyukti patr ke liye tapati garmi main sadakon par the
 In December 2016, the then SP government issued an order to recruit 16,460 teachers
 isamen se 4000 urdu shikshak the or 12460 anya shikshak the jinke bare main aapane prime time main kai baar suna hoga
 They were also counseled on 22 and 23 March before the new government was formed, but after the new government came on 23 May, the entire process was stopped in the name of review
 sarkari skulon main urdu shikshakon kaa pad hota he usee kii bahaali honi thi
 All of them also have Basic Teaching Certificate like 12460 teachers
 4000 urdu shikshakon main se tees pratishat gair muslim hai
 Of these 720 posts are reserved for scheduled castes and tribes
 aapako lagegaa ki dharm ke kaaran nahin ho rahaa magar dharm kaaran hota to 12460 beatisi shikshakon main 8000 dharne par nahin baithe rahete ki unhen bhi niyukti patr mil jaae
 There are people of all religions in twenty two lakh education friends, yet their demand is unnoticed
 in logon ne vandemaataram ke naare bhi lagaae, bharat mata kii jai bhi kaha, sabakaa aahvaan kiya, sabko yaad kiya magar bahaali nahin hui
 Think for a minute, if a government chooses you, should the appointment be confirmed twice by the court, should not the appointment letter be received? The same happened with 12640 teachers
 unhen bhi do-do baar hai court se jeet mili he magar abhi tak sabhi kii jwining nahin hui he
 On 3 November 2017, Urdu teachers also won the case from the High Court
 upi sarkaar 28 november ko division bench chali gai magar 12 april 2018 ko sarkaar mukadmaa haar gai
 The court said that within four months these four thousand Urdu teachers have not yet joined
 12 june 2018 ko do maah kii seemaa puri ho gai
 Now if the court order cannot be implemented, then think where the public will go
 aisa nahin he ki rajya ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath inase mulaakaat yaa baat nahin karte hai
 On June 22, the Chief Minister met Urdu teachers, to get the meeting, these youth had to sit on a dharna outside the house of Minister Anupama Jaiswal
 4 or 8 june ko bhi in logon ne dharna diya tha
 i met the Chief Minister but after 22 June, 6 July came, nothing has been known or done yet
 mukhyamantri ne turant karrwai kaa aashwaasan diya tha, shaayad unki kitaab kaa matlab 15 din kuch nahin hota hoga
 It is easy to do Jindabad Murdabad on Twitter, see Jindabad Murdabad by getting sticks on the road
 jaays maaghon par bhi sunwaayee nahin he
 If the public starts to remain oblivious to the public, then it will suffer from all kinds of people because when your turn comes, this system will do the same to you, which is doing to these millions
 isliye aap dekhie ki aapke saath kya-kya ho saktaa he
 If such people do not protest then it will not seem that democracy is alive in India
 meri raay main aap sabhi nagarikon ko is baat kaa adhikaar maangana chahie ki dharna pradarshan ke liye sarkaar suvidhaayen uplabdh karaae
 By demonstrating, you owe democracy, you trust the rest of the people that we are still alive
 bharat ke loktantr ko in logon kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie ki ye sabhi upi ke azamgarh or gajipur zile se chalakar dilli aae hai
 The journey of 900 km is so that they can convey their voice to Prime Minister Modi
 dilli ke ramlila maidan kii khurduri zamin par khud ko khinchate hue ye log is aas main chaar dinon tak yahaan rahe ki koi to aayega jo unki baat sunegaa or pradhanmantri tak pahunchaa degaa
 Bibhori Pal can not see, but even Delhi did not see them
 bhikaipur, babura gaanv se 200 log jinamein se 100 ke kareeb mahilaayein thim or 70-80 ke kareeb wo log jinhen pradhanmantri ne nayaa naam to de diya magar un tak unka haq nahin pahunchaa
 If you strengthen the heart a little, you will see how strong their faith will be in reaching the voice in democracy that they have come to Delhi, how sad they must have returned that no one heard the voice
 mahilaayein isliye ain thim ki sabhi ko vidhwaa pension nahin mil rahaa he
 Facing physical challenges, these people came to face the challenges of the system because they do not have toilets
 hamaare sahyogi susheel mahapatra kii nazar in par na padi hoti to inke zarie ek behad gambhir baat kehane kaa mauka nahin miltaa
 You do not know how much rottenness has taken place within the system that it has started treating citizens as insects
 thik isi shabd kaa istemaal kiya ek sajjan ne
 Said that people kill when they go to the toilet in another farm
 jab adhikari ke paas shauchalay maangane jate hai tab inase keede makode kii tarah bartaav kiya jaataa he
 Now if poor people from villages come to sit in Delhi, should 5000 rupees be taken from them? Earlier, there was a free sit-in demonstration at Jantar Mantar, it was removed and sent to Ramlila Maidan, but with a new condition that fees would have to be paid for picketing
 raajnneeti itani besharm na hui hoti to sansad se kanoon paas karti ki dharna dene kaa adhikaar loktantric adhikaar he
 The government will give you an honorarium for picketing
 khud ye raajnneetik dal ke log ek duusare ke gharon ko gherte rahete hai or tivi par aate rahete hai magar aam logon ko dharna dene ke liye 5000 rupee dene pade, is sawaal par kyon nahin sochaa janaa chahie
 Even Sushil Mahapatra would not have known if a Delhiite who had come to support these poor people, would not have opposed the officer asking for money
 tippaniyan One more question came to our mind
 gajipur ke gaanv main to shauchalay nahin he lekin ramlila maidan main kya in logon ke liye shauchalay kaa intazaam kiya gaya tha? in logon ne bataaya ki vahaan kaa shauchalay band tha, isliye kaaphi takalif uthaate hue dur ke shauchalay main gaye jahaan paanch rupee dekar istemaal kiya
 Sushil Mahapatra went to Ramlila Maidan again to see what the toilet was all about
 yahaan se nikalne ke baad susheel kii mulaakaat ek or parivaar se hui
 This family belongs to Delhi and has been sitting here on dharna for the last eight days
 inaki dukaan ujaad gai he phir bhi paanch hazaar kii parchi kataakar yahaan dharna de rahe hai
 The question is simple
 jab sarkaar paisa le rahi he to phir sarkaar inase sunne kyon nahin aati he
 Shouldn't the government be guaranteed to listen after taking money? susheel mahapatra ne ramlila maidan ke prabandhan se jude adhikariyon se baat karne kaa prayaas kiya magar camere par baat karne ke liye koi taiyaar nahin hua
 It is said that the five thousand which are taken are returned later
 ab aap sochie
 You have gone to the government or to the usurer
 dharna dene ke liye paanch hazaar dijie jo dharne ke baad waapas ho jayega, sunakar aapako ajeeb nahin laga
 Have you ever seen the picture of the flock when 4000 Urdu teachers were on the streets of Lucknow on May 14 and 15 for their appointment letter
 disambar 2016 main us vakt kii sapa sarkaar ne 16,460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 Out of this there were 4000 Urdu teachers and 12460 other teachers whom you must have heard many times in prime time
 nai sarkaar banane se pehle 22 or 23 march ko inaki bhi counselling ho gai thi magar 23 may ko nai sarkaar aane ke baad samiksha ke naam par sari prakriya roak di gai
 Urdu teachers have a post in government schools, the same was to be restored
 in sabhi ke paas bhi 12460 shikshakon kii tarah basic teaching certificate he
 Thirty percent of the 4000 Urdu teachers are non-muslims
 inamen se 720 pad anusuchit jati or janajati ke liye arakshit hai
 You will feel that it is not happening due to religion, but if religion is due, then in the 12460 BTC teachers do not sit on 8000 dharna so that they too get appointment letters
 paune do lakh shiksha mitron main sabhi dharmon ke log hai phir bhi inaki maang par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin he
 These people also raised slogans of Vande Mataram, also called Bharat Mata ki Jai, invoked everyone, remembered everyone but did not get reinstated
 ek minute ke liye sochie, agar koi sarkaar aapkaa chayan kare, adaalat se do do baar us chayan par muhar lage to kya niyukti patr nahin mil janaa chahie? 12640 shikshakon ke saath bhi yahi hua
 He too has won twice from the High Court but not all have joined yet
 isi 3 november 2017 ko hoicourt se urdu shikshak bhi cese jeet gaye
 The UP government moved to the division bench on 28 November but lost the case on 12 April 2018
 adaalat ne kaha ki 2 maah ke bheetar in chaar hazaar urdu shikshakon kii abhi tak jwining nahin hui he
 The two-month limit was reached on 12 June 2018
 ab agar adaalat kaa aadesh lagu nahin ho saktaa to sochie janata kahaan jaaegi
 It is not that the Chief Minister of the state Yogi Adityanath does not meet or talk to him
 22 june ko mukhyamantri ne urdu shikshakon se mulaakaat kii thi, is mulaakaat ko hasil karne ke liye in naujavaanon ko mantri anupama jaisawal ke ghar ke baahar dharne par baithna padaa tha
 On 4 and 8 June, these people also staged a sit-in
 mukhyamantri se mulaakaat to hui magar 22 june ke baad 6 july aa gaya, kuch bhi hone yaa kiye jane kaa ab tak pataa nahin chalaa he
 The Chief Minister had assured immediate action, perhaps his book would have meant nothing for 15 days
 twitor par zindaabad murdaabaad karnaa aasaan hota he, sadak par utar kar lathi khate hue zindaabad murdaabaad karke dekhie
 There is no hearing on legitimate requests
 janata hi janata se bekabar rahane lage to iskaa nuksaan har tarah kii janata se hoga kyonki jab aapaki baari aegi to aapke saath bhi ye system vaisaa hi karegaa jo in lakhon logon ke saath kar rahaa he
 So you see what can happen to you
 aise log pradarshan na karen to lagegaa hi nahin ki bharat main loktantr zindaa he
 In my opinion, all of you citizens should demand the right that the government should provide facilities for demonstration
 dharna pradarshan kar aap loktantr par ahsaan karte hai, janata ke baaki hisson ko bharosa dete hai ki abhi ham zindaa hai
 The democracy of India should thank these people that they have all come to Delhi from Azamgarh and Ghazipur districts of UP
 900 kimi kii railyatra isliye ki taaki ve pradhanmantri modi tak apni awaz pahunchaa saken
 These people stayed here for four days while dragging themselves on the rough ground of Ramlila Maidan in Delhi that someone will come who will listen to them and will reach the Prime Minister
 bibhori paal dekh nahin sakate hai magar dilli ne bhi to inhen nahin dekha
 From Bhikaipur, Babura village, 200 people, out of which around 100 were women and around 70-80 people who were given a new name by the Prime Minister but they did not get their rights
 kaleje ko thodaa majboot kiijie to aap dekh paaenge ki loktantr main awaz ke pahunchane main inaki aasthaa kitni majboot hogi ki ye dilli tak aae, kitni udaasi lekar laute honge ki kisi ne awaz hi nahin suni
 Women came because not all are getting widow pension
 shaareerik chunautiyon kaa saamana karte hue ye log system kii chunautiyon se isliye bhidane aae the ki inke paas shauchalay nahin he
 If our colleague Sushil Mahapatra had not looked at them, he would not have got a chance to say a very serious thing through them
 aapako pataa hi nahin chalata ki system ke bheetar kitni sadan aa gai he ki wo nagarikon ko keede makode samajhane laga he
 The same word was used by a gentleman
 kaha ki jab duusare ke khet main shauchalay ke liye jate hai tab log maarthe hai
 When the officers go to the toilet to ask, they are treated like insects
 ab agar gaanvon se garib log dilli dharna dene aaenge to kya unase 5000 rupaya liya janaa chahie? pehle jantar mantar par muft main dharna pradarshan hota tha, vahaan se hataakar ramlila maidan bhej diya gaya magar ek nai shart ke saath ki dharna dene ke liye fees deni hogi
 Had politics not been so shameless, it would have passed legislation from Parliament that the right to picket is a democratic right
 dharna dene par sarkaar aapako maandey degi
 The people of these political parties themselves surround each other's houses and keep coming on TV, but the common people had to pay 5000 rupees to picket, why this question should not be thought of
 susheel mahapatra ko bhi pataa nahin chalata agar in garib logon ke saath samarthan dene aae ek dilli vaale ne paise maang rahe adhikari kaa virodh na kiya hota
 The comments hamaare dimaag main ek sawaal or aayaa
 There is no toilet in the village of Ghazipur, but was there a toilet for these people in Ramlila Maidan? These people told that the toilet there was closed, so taking a lot of trouble went to the distant toilet where they used to pay five rupees
 susheel mahapaatr dobaaraa ramlila maidan gaye, yah dekhne ke liye ki shauchalay kaa kya intazaam he
 After leaving here, Sushil met another family
 yah parivaar dilli kaa hi he or pichley aath dinon se yahaan dharne par baitha he
 His shop is devastated, yet after cutting five thousand slips, he is staging a sit-in here
 sawaal simpal he
 When the government is taking money, then why does the government not come to hear from them
 kya paise lene ke baad sarkaar ko sunne kii guarantee nahin deni chahie? Sushil Mahapatra tried to talk to the officials associated with the management of Ramlila Maidan but no one was ready to talk on camera
 yahi bataaya ki paanch hazaar jo liya jaataa he wo baad main waapas ho jaataa he
 Now you think aap sarkaar ke paas gaye hai yaa soodakhor ke paas gaye hai
 Give five thousand to picket which will be returned after picketing, you did not feel strange to hear
 ek minute ke liye sochie, agar koi sarkaar aapkaa chayan kare, adaalat se do do baar us chayan par muhar lage to kya niyukti patr nahin mil janaa chahie? 12640 shikshakon ke saath bhi yahi hua

 aisa nahin he ki rajya ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath inase mulaakaat yaa baat nahin karte hai
 On June 22, the Chief Minister met Urdu teachers, to get the meeting, these youth had to sit on a dharna outside the house of Minister Anupama Jaiswal
 4 or 8 june ko bhi in logon ne dharna diya tha
 i met the Chief Minister but after 22 June, 6 July came, nothing has been known or done yet
 mukhyamantri ne turant karrwai kaa aashwaasan diya tha, shaayad unki kitaab kaa matlab 15 din kuch nahin hota hoga
 It is easy to do Jindabad Murdabad on Twitter, see Jindabad Murdabad by getting sticks on the road

 If the public starts to remain oblivious to the public, then it will suffer from all kinds of people because when your turn comes, this system will do the same to you, which is doing to these millions
 isliye aap dekhie ki aapke saath kya-kya ho saktaa he
 If such people do not protest then it will not seem that democracy is alive in India
 meri raay main aap sabhi nagarikon ko is baat kaa adhikaar maangana chahie ki dharna pradarshan ke liye sarkaar suvidhaayen uplabdh karaae
 By demonstrating, you owe democracy, you trust the rest of the people that we are still alive
 bharat ke loktantr ko in logon kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie ki ye sabhi upi ke azamgarh or gajipur zile se chalakar dilli aae hai
 The journey of 900 km is so that they can convey their voice to Prime Minister Modi
 dilli ke ramlila maidan kii khurduri zamin par khud ko khinchate hue ye log is aas main chaar dinon tak yahaan rahe ki koi to aayega jo unki baat sunegaa or pradhanmantri tak pahunchaa degaa
 Bibhori Pal can not see, but even Delhi did not see them
 bhikaipur, babura gaanv se 200 log jinamein se 100 ke kareeb mahilaayein thim or 70-80 ke kareeb wo log jinhen pradhanmantri ne nayaa naam to de diya magar un tak unka haq nahin pahunchaa
 If you strengthen the heart a little, you will see how strong their faith will be in reaching the voice in democracy that they have come to Delhi, how sad they must have returned that no one heard the voice
 mahilaayein isliye ain thim ki sabhi ko vidhwaa pension nahin mil rahaa he
 Facing physical challenges, these people came to face the challenges of the system because they do not have toilets
 hamaare sahyogi susheel mahapatra kii nazar in par na padi hoti to inke zarie ek behad gambhir baat kehane kaa mauka nahin miltaa
 You do not know how much rottenness has taken place within the system that it has started treating citizens as insects
 thik isi shabd kaa istemaal kiya ek sajjan ne

 jab adhikari ke paas shauchalay maangane jate hai tab inase keede makode kii tarah bartaav kiya jaataa he
 Now if poor people from villages come to sit in Delhi, should 5000 rupees be taken from them? Earlier, there was a free sit-in demonstration at Jantar Mantar, it was removed and sent to Ramlila Maidan, but with a new condition that fees would have to be paid for picketing
 raajnneeti itani besharm na hui hoti to sansad se kanoon paas karti ki dharna dene kaa adhikaar loktantric adhikaar he
 The government will give you an honorarium for picketing
 khud ye raajnneetik dal ke log ek duusare ke gharon ko gherte rahete hai or tivi par aate rahete hai magar aam logon ko dharna dene ke liye 5000 rupee dene pade, is sawaal par kyon nahin sochaa janaa chahie
 Even Sushil Mahapatra would not have known if a Delhiite who had come to support these poor people, would not have opposed the officer asking for money
 tippaniyan One more question came to our mind
 gajipur ke gaanv main to shauchalay nahin he lekin ramlila maidan main kya in logon ke liye shauchalay kaa intazaam kiya gaya tha? in logon ne bataaya ki vahaan kaa shauchalay band tha, isliye kaaphi takalif uthaate hue dur ke shauchalay main gaye jahaan paanch rupee dekar istemaal kiya
 Sushil Mahapatra went to Ramlila Maidan again to see what the toilet was all about
 yahaan se nikalne ke baad susheel kii mulaakaat ek or parivaar se hui
 This family belongs to Delhi and has been sitting here on dharna for the last eight days
 inaki dukaan ujaad gai he phir bhi paanch hazaar kii parchi kataakar yahaan dharna de rahe hai
 The question is simple
 jab sarkaar paisa le rahi he to phir sarkaar inase sunne kyon nahin aati he
 Shouldn't the government be guaranteed to listen after taking money? susheel mahapatra ne ramlila maidan ke prabandhan se jude adhikariyon se baat karne kaa prayaas kiya magar camere par baat karne ke liye koi taiyaar nahin hua
 It is said that the five thousand which are taken are returned later
 ab aap sochie
 You have gone to the government or to the usurer
 dharna dene ke liye paanch hazaar dijie jo dharne ke baad waapas ho jayega, sunakar aapako ajeeb nahin laga

 As a result, students adopted a gradual sit-in strategy from April 16 in Allahabad University

 As soon as the information was found about the disturbance in the university, state Congress President Rita Bahuguna Joshi (former teacher of the university) spoke to the Union Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal and demanded an inquiry into the whole episode
 joshi kahati hai, ''kulapati kii samvadaheenata vishvavidhyalay main hue chaatr updrav ke liye jimmedaar he
 The university administration should first evacuate the hostel from those who have been frozen in an unauthorized manner

 sibiai ne bade maamalon kii jaanch jaise 1993 blast, rajeev gandhi hatyakand, harshat mehta maamla samet kai bade bank ghotaalon kii jaanch kii he
 CBI was formed to investigate big cases but now who will come
 unhone aage kaha ki donon varisht afasar hai or donon kariyar ke aakhri padaav par hai donon ko jhagada baithkar khatm karnaa chahie tha or aisa nahin ho paa rahaa tha to sarkaar ko jhagada khatm karwaanaa tha
 The current situation is not right
 giriraaj ne mamata ko gherakendriya mantri giriraaj singh ne mukhyamantrimamta banerjeeke bayaan par kaha ki mamata ek kahani hai ki jaisaa hota he vaise hi dusron ko dekhte hai bharat sarkaar ne paardarshita ke tahat kaam kiya he or kabhi hamane koi chitfund cond nahin kiya he jo chitfund cond karte hai unako is tareeke se dar lagata he
 The government has taken the decision with transparency
 giriraaj singh ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke bayaan par kaha he ki rahul gandhi jhooth bolte hai
 They have taken the contract of lies
 loksabhaa main jo jhooth bolte hai, usase bada koi jhootha nahin ho saktaa
 In a way, he is a liar like Hitler's minister, trying to create confusion among people by speaking a lie a hundred times
 mamata ne bijepi ko gheraabudhvaar subah pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamat banerjee ne twit kar kaha ki CBI ab BBI (BJP Bureau of Investigation) ban chuki he, jo ki kaaphi dukhad he
 CBI has now become so called BBI (BJP Bureau of Investigation) - very unfortunate! - Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial) October 24, 2018 Apart from Mamta, CPI leader Sitaram Yechury also targeted the Modi government on this issue
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar or pradhanmantri narenr modi ne sibiai kaa raajnneetik istemaal kiya he
 He is transferring several officers to save his officer
 unhone kaha ki jo afasar asthana ke khilaaf maamle kii jaanch kar rahaa tha, use andaman kyon bhej diya gaya
 Congress leader Randeep Surjewala accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of destroying the autonomy of the CBI
 unhone kaha ki piem modi ne khud to sibiai afasaron ko nahin hataaya, lekin sivisi ke jariye ye kaam kiya
 Thar Express is due to tensions between India and Pakistan
 Devotees who visit Hinglaj Mata in Bandanwratra, due to the tension in myusha-indo-pak relations, stopped due to the Thar Express
 navaratri main rajasthan, gujarat, madhyapradesh, kerala sahit anya rajyon ke hinglaj mata ke upaask pakistan ke baluchistan main shaktipeeth ke darshan karne ke liye pichley 13 varshon se lagaataar ja rahe hai, lekin ab yah silsilaa ruk gaya he
 The Thar Express has been a simple and accessible vehicle for the devotees of Hinglaj
 navaratri main shaktipeeth ke darshan karne ke liye isi train se aana-janaa hota tha lekin is saal thar express band he
 In such a situation, the devotees were unable to visit the Hinglaj Shaktipeeth in the Sharadiya Navratri, which makes them very sorry
 thar express kyon ho gai band?upaask bataate he ki paak sthit hinglaj mata ke darshan karne ke liye purv vitt evam videsh mantri jaswantsingh ke saath gaye the
 After that, Hinglaj goes for darshan of mother for 13 consecutive years, but this time due to tension in indo-pak relations, Thar Express is not being operated due to which mother has been denied to visit
 thar express se pichley 13 saalon se lagaataar hinglaj mata ke darshan ke liye jane vaale upaskon kaa is baar silsilaa tut gaya he
 This time, devotees who are going to go out have a pity not to see Hinglaj Mata
 navaratri shuru hone se pehle upaask isi train se hinglaj ke liye ravaanaa ho jate the
 At the same time, they used to participate in rituals in the temple and also return by Thar Express
 saptahik chalane vaali thar express ke sanchaalan ke anusaar hi hinglaj bhakt apane aane-jane kaa kaarykram banaate the
 In fact, the closure of the Thar Express has not only broken the process of worshipers who go to see Hinglaj Mata, but also the connection between the bread and daughter of Sindh and Hind has been cut
 log apano se milane ke liye thar express ke phir se shuru hone kii ummid lagaae baithe hai
 In Shamli, Uttar Pradesh, there was a fierce encounter between the police and the miscreants last week, in which Constable Ankit Tomar was killed
 encounter main police ne kukhyat apradhi sabir ko bhi maar giraaya tha
 In revenge for Ankit's martyrdom, UP police arrested another gang rogue waiting within 48 hours
 2 janvari kii us raat encounter ke dauraan kya hua, police ne kaise badmaashon kaa pataa lagaaya, kaise unhen gheraa yah puri dastaan shamali ke captain IPS adhikari ajay sharma ne apane fasebuk pej par ek post ke jariye share kii hai
 This post by Ajay Sharma explains what it means for the police to lose a teammate
 ajay sharma apane post main likhte hai ki ek shaam ko ek phone kol aata he or soochna milti he ki ek bade durdaant apradhi kii
 The gang of this criminal had killed 3 policemen, who escaped from police custody in Barabanki district while being taken to jail for the last 7 months
 kuch saal pehle ek vyapaaree se rangadari maangi or na dene par do bhaaiyon kii hatya bich bazaar kar faraar ho gaye
 The informers against him put him to death
 is kukhyat apradhi ke khilaaf hatya ke 12 mukademon sahit kul 68 mukademe darj hai, jisamen 10 karod kii tanishk dakaiti kaa cese bhi shaamil he
 He writes, "when the information was received, i was attending an organization's New Year program
 use bich main choda or teen vishwasaneey tiimon ko ek jagah ikattha kiya
 Whenever a policeman goes somewhere to punish, there is only one thought in him that the criminal who is a threat to the society can somehow arrest him
 us vaqt uske liye uske parivaar se zyada samaaj hota he
 If they do not think so, they may never be able to catch such criminals
 "ajay aage likhte hai ki dabish ke liye taiyaari kii gai
 Strategy was created
 maukey par lagbhag 10 baje pahunche
 It was dark
 sabhi ne apni pojishan lee
 a team in which the brave soldier Ankit Tomar arrived to cover the room and fired from both sides
 ankit ke sir main goli lag chuki thi
 He fell to the ground
 us vaqt shaayad uske man main apane mata-pita va patni, 4 saal kii bacchee or 4 maah ke bete kaa khyal jarur aayaa hoga, kyonki shaayad un kuch palon ke baad uske dimag kii khun kii supplai band ho gayi thi
 The miscreant was also shot, but he jumped and tried to escape
 jahaan ham logon ne pojishan le rakhi thi
 There bullets were running from both sides
 golibari main badmaash maaraa gaya, lekin marate-marate ek or jaanbaaj ko ghayal kar diya
 Luckily, that brave soldier has come out of danger
 vah bataate hai ki apane saathiyon ko ham lekar hospital pahunche
 Ankit's condition was critical and after 24 hours of life-death struggle, he was martyred
 yah pulicekarmi ke kartavya path par chalate hue sabase bada balidaan tha
 Losing a member of your team is a big loss
 ek captain ke liye apane saathi ke shav ko kandhaa dena vaisaa hi he jaise ek baap apane bete ko
 It was overwhelming to feel this sorrow
 jaise sab ladaaiyaan jeetakaraham ek jang haar gaye
 May his soul rest in peace
 apni team ke saathiyon kii yaad main tum hameshaa bane rahoge ankit
 Let's say that on January 2, Ankit was shot in the head and chest in an encounter with the crook Sabir
 dimag main goli dhansane se vah coma main chale gaye the
 He was placed on a ventilator
 desh ke varisht chikitsakon ne ankit ke brain main dhansi goli nikaalane ke liye bharsak prayaas kiya, lekin safal nahin ho sake
 Ankit, a resident of Wajidpur of Barout in Baghpat, was admitted to the UP Police in the year 2011
 saal 2012 main unki shaadi hui thi
 They have a five-month-old son and a four-year-old daughter
 unke pita jaipal ne bataaya ki ankit unki teen santanon main sabase bade the
 He has a younger sister and a brother
 IPS afasar ajay sharma kaa yah post maanviya samvednaaon se bharaa hua he or bataata he ki pulicekarmi bhi haad-maance ke bane aam insaan hai, jinhen apane saathiyon or is samaaj kii chintaa rahati he
 This post by Ajay Sharma describes how a policeman is fighting his life to protect this society
 gyaat ho ki 4 janvari ko shamali police line main hajaaron logon kii bheed membharat mata kii jai ke naaron ke bichashahid ankit tomars ko rajkeey sammaan ke saath antim vidaai di gai
 The UP government has announced financial assistance of Rs 50 lakh to the family of martyr Ankit Tomar
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne shahid sipaahi ankit tomars kii veerta or saahas kii prashansa karte hue unke parijanon ko aarthik sahaayta die jane kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Actress Kamya Punjabi, who was part of Big Screen's most talked about and controversial reality TV show Bigg Boss, has surrounded the contestants of season 13 in her recent tweet
 kamya ne vartmaan sijan ke contestants par unke dabbu or baikabiching vaale bartaav ke liye sawaal uthaaya he
 Kamya wrote, "tell me one thing why these people do not talk with open mouth
 " unhone apane twit main big bos or colors kaa hesh tag lagaaya he
 Let us know that many contestants who tweeted about the show on social media are also complaining about the show
 bataa den ki is sijan main adhiktar contestant aage badhane kii sambhaavnaaon ko banaae rakhane kii koshish main khule maidan main aakar kisi se nahin bhid rahe hai
 It can be said that this time the action is less and diplomacy and hippocracy is slightly more
 rashmi or siddharth jaise powerful contestant bhi sidhe taur par saamne nahin aa rahe hai
 What is the reason for the lack of action? One of the major reasons for this is that it is being considered that it is necessary to maintain connections to stay in this season and keep going
 maaloom ho ki kamya punjabi bhi big bos kaa hissaa rah chuki hai
 She was a part of the show in the 7th season of the show
 kamya takreeban 13 hafte tak sho main tiki rahi thim or jitne vakt vah sho kaa hissaa raheen unhone jamkar games khele
 Kamya, considered to be the strongest contestant of the season, had become active in the 14th week

 france kii rajdhani perisamen ek bada aatanki hamalaa hua he
 More than 150 people have been reported killed in shootings and explosions
 paris main kai jagahon ek saath hamale kiye gaye
 France's border has been sealed in view of violent incidents in Paris
 saath hi paris main immergency kaa elaan bhi kar diya gaya he
 But if we consider, it can be said that France remains the target for terrorist organizations
 sirf ye hi nahin balki isi saal 2015 main or bhi kai aatanki hamalon ne is desh ko hilaayaa he
 Combining this attack, this is the sixth terrorist attack to be held in France this year
 saal kii shuruyaat main hi paris ko ek bada aatanki hamalaa jhelana padaa tha
 On January 7, 2015, 20 people were killed in a terrorist attack in the office of the satirical magazine Charlie Addo in Paris
 'allahu akbar' kaa naaraa lagaate hue kuch nakaabposh patrika ke daftar main ghuse or andhadhundh goliyaan chalaane lage
 Four chief cartoonists and the editor-in-chief were killed in the attack
 iske baad 3 farvari, 2015 ko naaise main ek yahudee saamudayik centre kii rakhwali karte hue 3 sainikon par hamalaa hua tha
 But there was no news of anyone being killed in this attack
 kareeb do maheene baad phir 19 april ko ek algerian yahudee dwaara 2 charchon par hamale kiye gaye
 In which 1 woman died
 26 june 2015 ko phir se purvi france kii ek gas factory main dindahaade ek sandigdh islamic hamalavar ne ek vyakti kii galaa katkar hatya kar di, jabaki do anya logon ko visphotak upkarnon se ghayal kar diya
 Once again, two months later, on 21 August 2015, a heavily armed terrorist fired on a high-speed train going from Amsterdam to Paris, injuring at least 4 people
 hamalavar ke paas se ek clashnicove, ek automatic pistaul, gola-barood or anya saamagree baraamad kiye gaye the
 There may not have been any major terrorist attack after Charlie Addo in January, but these were all indicative
 aakhir ye sab aatanki hi hamale the yaa kahen maanavtaa ke virdohi the
 The US strongly denied reports that foreign employees are paid less than a dollar a day in its missions abroad
 america ne kaha he ki uski vetan yojanaayen kshetra vishesh kii 'maujuuda vetan daron or muaavja niyamon' par aadhaarit hai
 When asked about the report of the Office of the Director General of the State Department of 2009, State Department spokeswoman Aimee Horn said, "this is not true
" is report main bataaya gaya tha ki videshon main america rajanyik mishnon dwaara naukari par rakhe gaye sthaneey karmchaariyon ko pratidin ek dollar se bhi kam kaa vetan miltaa he
 He said, according to Section 408 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, our compensation schemes are based on the existing local employment-related wage rates and compensation schemes
 horn ne kaha, ham kisi bhi kshetra main maujuuda paramparaon ke anusaar karmchaariyon ko laabhon kaa bantwaaraa bhi karte hai
 In markets where inflation is high or there is economic and political instability, we closely monitor salaries and adjust accordingly
 gauratlab he ki america apane videshi rajanyik mishnon main apane rajanyikon kii madad ke liye hajaaron kii sankhya main sthaneey karmchaariyon ko niyukt karte hai
 In the year 2008, more than 51 thousand local personnel were working in American missions worldwide
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apni hi khinchi lakshmana rekha shuukravaar ko paar kar lee
 In an election meeting in Doda, Jammu, he launched a personal attack on nda's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for the first time
 rahul ne modi kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha ki unhone bahut se chunaav lade hai, lekin pehali baar likhaa he ki shaadishuda hai
 He hides his wife's name, but puts all his emphasis in spying on a woman
 jabaki khud rahul kuch samay pehle tak apni party ke logon se kehete rahe hai ki vipakshi netaaon par vyaktigat hamale nahin karne chahie
 By evening, the Congress Party approached the Election Commission on this issue
 kanoon mantri kapil sibbal ne ayog se kaha ki modi ne apane puraane halafnaamon main vaivaahik sthiti chhipaai, isliye unke khilaaf karrwai honi chahie or unke chunaav ladane par roak lagani chahie
 Earlier, by putting a photo of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the Congress website, he was reminded of his statement that Modi had been advised to follow Rajdharma
 aakhir kya vajah he ki har chunavi sabha main soochna, shiksha, swasthya or bhojan kaa adhikaar dene kii baat karne vaale rahul ke bhaashanon kaa zyaadaatar hissaa ab modi par hamalon main kendrit hone laga he
 What is the reason that more interest of Congress leaders is being reflected in Narendra Modi's marital life rather than MNREGA and Land Acquisition Act
 congress ke netaa upie ke 10 saal ke shashan kii uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan karne ke bajaae is baat par zyaada chintaa kyon kar rahe hai ki bijepi main laalkrishna adwani or jaswant singh ko unka haq kyon nahin mila? It seems that the major reason behind this is the third round of voting held on Thursday
 jin 91 siton par guuruuvaar ko vot pade, unamem 45 siten congress ke paas hai, jabaki bijepi ke paas sirf 13 or matdaan ke baad mili feedback ne sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko hairaan kar diya he
 It seems that in the seats where the voting took place in the states of western Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, etc
, most people have voted against the Congress and in support of Modi
 kai siton par logon ne ye jane bina ki bijepi kaa ummidavaar koun he, sirf uske chunaav chinh par yah kehete hue vot diya he ki ve sidhe modi ko vot dena chaahate hai
 That is, the possibility of reversing the 2009 results on these seats is being expressed
 yahaan tak ki pashchimi urisa main bhi bijepi ko samarthan milane kii khabaren hai
 There the BJP has left the Congress behind and put itself in the second position after the BJD
 chunaav se pehle aae tamaam janamat surveykshanon main is ore ishaara kiya jaataa rahaa, lekin congress inhen khaarij karti rahi
 But after the third round of voting, there is a strong possibility that the Congress is indeed moving towards its worst performance yet
 isse pehle, congress ko 1999 main sabase kam 114 loksabhaa siten ai thim
 To be less than this would mean to question its relevance
 yah vyaktigat taur par rahul gandhi ke liye bhi ek bahut bada jhatka hoga, kyonki congress ye chunaav unhen hi aage rakhkar lard rahi he
 Manmohan Singh was the face of the Congress in the 2009 elections, but this time Rahul Gandhi is the face of the Congress and it is clear that the failure of the Congress will blow his head
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki congress kii puri koshish he ki uski siten kisi bhi tarah 1999 ke aankade se neeche na ja sake
 But for this, how effective Congress strategy will be to launch a personal attack on Modi, it is difficult to say for sure
 isse pehle jab bhi congress ne modi par vyaktigat hamale kiye, modi ne unhen apane phaayde ke liye istemaal kar liya
 Whether or not Modi has been with his wife, whether or not he has disclosed his marital status, these are personal things which the ordinary Indian voter has no concern with nor does it matter to him while casting his vote
 khud modi bhi aisi vyaktigat tippaniyan karne main peeche nahin rahe hai
 She was severely criticized a few months ago for her comments about Sonia Gandhi's illness and Shashi Tharoor's 'girlfriend'
 yah zarur he ki matadaata ko kisi bhi netaa ke vyaktigat jivan par keechad uchhaale janaa kabhi pasand nahin aata or vah aisa karne waalon ko munhtod jawaab detaa he
 Pramod Mahajan, who made Sonia Gandhi's issue of foreign origin in 2004 and made extremely lewd comments about him, had to face the trouble and the public showed him the way out
 indira gandhi ko 'goongi gudiya' bolne waalon ke munh bhi janata ne band karaae the or manmohan singh ko sabase kamazor pradhanmantri bataane vaale adwani ko bhi janata ne hi jawaab diya tha
 The question is that even if the Congress, despite not learning all this, is bent on derailing its campaign, is it not a display of frustration? gadakari ne kaha ki pradooshan ke morche par bhi kisi tarah kaa samjhauta nahin kiya jayega
 Nor will i be panicked about the steps taken in this regard

 uttar pradesh main pratipakshi dalon ne mayawati sarkaar par banda main balaatkaar peedit 17 varshiya dalit ladki ko kathith rup se dhamkaane ke liye jila police adheekshak anil das ko bachaane kaa aarope lagaate hue maang kii he ki unhen tatkaal nilambit karke unke viruddh karrwai kii jaye
 The opposition parties alleged, 'banda Superintendent of Police Anil Das had pressured the rape victim girl to withdraw his charges and threatened her with intimidation
 unke nilamban ke bina is maamle main nyaay puraa nahin hota
 Congress spokesperson Subodh Srivastava said, "however, junior police officers and the jailer have been suspended
" magar jis adhikari ke ishaare par balaatkaar peedit ladki ko daraaya dhamkaaya ja rahaa tha or uske viruddh kahin koi karrwai hoti dikhaayi nahin pad rahi he
 He said that in the Kanpur rape case, the state government had the same attitude and there was no concrete action against the then Deputy Inspector General of Police Prem Prakash
 shrivastav ne kaha ki ab ucchtam nyaayalay ne bhi banda balaatkaar cond kaa sangyaan le liya he to ummid he ki taqatvar adhikari bhi karrwai se batch nahin paayenge
 SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said that the Mayawati government wants to take loot of bravado only by taking action against small officials
 magar bade adhikariyon ke viruddh karrwai karne kii himmat nahin dikhaa paa rahi he
 Chaudhary said, 'it seems that the Mayawati government is unable to muster the courage to punish senior officials because they know the secrets of this government and if action is taken against them, the government will be exposed
 ’ bhaajapa pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak ne kaha ki yadi kanishtha adhikari doshi hai to jiladhikari or jila police adheekshak apni jimmedaari se kaise batch sakate he, kyonki chote adhikariyon ke kaamkaaj kii nigaraanee rakhana unki jimmedaari he
 Pathak said that due to no action against the District Superintendent of Police of Banda, there is increasing resentment among the local people and certainly the credibility of the action taken in this case is under question
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki jila police adheekshak jail main gayi, vahaan ghanto rahe or chori ke aarope main band rahi dalit ladki ko sattaruq dal ke vidhayak purushottam naresh dvivedi par lagaaye aaropon ko waapas lene ke liye daraaya dhamkaaya
 The Congress spokesman said that it is necessary to suspend the Superintendent of Police of Banda for proper investigation of the case
 isliye bhi ki aaropee vidhayak dvivedi baar baar apane virodhiyon se badla lene kii dhamkee de rahe he
 In such a situation, it is not proper for the District Superintendent of Police to save them

 Only Pakistan will stop terrorism first then there will be talk of friendship

 Since Devashree was an airhostess and was aware of security checks at the airport and inside the flight, she also knew of ways to avoid them
 devshree ne apni pojishan or jaankaree kaa bharpoor istemaal kiya or chah maheene se lagaataar hawala kaa paisa videsh le jaati rahi
 But it is not the case behind the involvement of hawala business that Devashree belonged to a poor family
 devshree kaa patiprivet companiyon main naukari dilaane vaali job agency ke liye kaam karata he
 Devashree's father-in-law is a retired defense officer and his father is a high-ranking officer in LIC

 The DRI team says that the way Devashree and Amit have sent crores of rupees to different countries through hawala, they are suspected of working under a large network
 lekin is tarah kisi airhostess ke jariye hawala kaarobaar karne kaa yah eppenokha maamalajrur he

 abhishek ne chetan bhagat kii nowell se prerit hokar 'kaay po che' banaayi thi or ab mashhoor lekhak charles dekan kii navel 'da great expectations ' se prerit hokar unhone fitur film banaayi he
 Although the plot of this novel has been used in English films many times, but for the first time a Hindi film has been made based on it, is the film able to draw the audience to the theater? Let's review - Kahani
 This story begins in Kashmir where Begum Hazrat (tabu) lives in her big bungalow, Begum is betrayed, which causes her to lose her faith, her daughter Firdaus (katrina Kaif) as a child
 He finds a working friend in the form of Noor (aditya Roy Kapur), Noor lives with his sister-in-law Rukhsar and brother-in-law Junaid, Noor is also an artist called Firdaus He falls in love as a child, but Begum has absolutely no tolerance for Noor to meet Firdaus, due to which Begum sends Firdaus to London to study, Noor falls alone, then the story moves on and Love story gets a result scriptfilm kii kahani kashmir kii vaadiyon main basii hui he jisamen vahaan ke lahaze or sanvaadon ko achche dhang se parosa gaya he
 On the one hand, there is a staunch Begum on her decision, on the other hand there is a question of love flourishing in the plaintiff, on the one hand there is a question of independence of the country, on the other hand, the restrictions on Ishq are also shown, but the screenplay and the story is missing in the whole film, everything is very big It looks like a forceful, Ajay Devgan has been taken in the film but has not been able to use him properly, Tabu has an acting but his teenage with shock Character Ravstha is seems ever plays Aditi Rao Heydari which mirrored the story that surprised great
 sirf kashmir kii vaadiyon ko dekhnaa sabase acha lagata he or aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo aapako apan ore aakarshit kar paae
 The climax is also very loose in this story
 film main begum ke kirdaar main tabboo ne bahut hi umdaa abhinay kiya he or kisi bhi pal lagane hi nahin diya kii wo acting kar rahi hai, kaaphi real se bhav parde par dikhaai die
 At the same time, Aditya Roy Kapoor and Katrina have also acted spontaneously
 film main aditi raav hydari, lara datta bhupati, ne bhi thik thaak kaam kiya he lekin bachapan ke aditya roy kapur kaa kirdaar nibhaate hue child artist ne bahut hi acha abhinay kiya he
 The best thing about musicfilm is its music
 amit trivedi ne behtareen gane banaae hai, pashmina, fitur, batiyaan sabhi kahani ke saath rachate hai
 Also, Hitesh Sonic has also made the background score right from the chance
 kamjor kadifilm kii sabase kamjor kadi isaki ulti-pulti script he, kirdaaron ko puri tarah se cash kar paane main yah kahani naakaam si dikhaai padati he, ise or bhi behatar banaaya ja saktaa tha, kashmir kii vaadiyaan beintahaan khubasurat hai lekin kahani feeki si dikhaai padati he
 Why Watch Good Locations, Aditya Roy Kapur, Katrina Kaif, Tabu's acting enthusiasts, or Amit Trivedi's music is a favorite, so check out this film

 co / 2g4rlksss0 The captivating scenes on the mountains during the rainy season would have lost the ink of how many poets, poets and writers had written in words
 aisa koi shkhs nahin milegaa jisane pahaado par bikhri padi hariyaali main apane or apano ke liye manapsand geet naa gunagunaaye hon
 Due to the rains, waterfalls are falling from the mountains in different places, as if the whole environment is like four moons
 jagah-jagah, kai jagah or har jagah kal-kal bahata pani ankho ko gajab kaa sukun detaa he
 And when life-giving water is visible everywhere
 
 
 vahaan par dar kaisaa
 but
 
 
 
 
 pahaad, jharne, nadiyaan, barish ye sab kuch saamne rahete huye bhi meri jindagi ke ye wo saat din the jab har pal ye pani, pani naa lagakar jehar lag rahaa tha, khaufnak lag rahaa tha, kaal lag rahaa tha
 Life-giving water had become life-consuming water
 kedaar baba ke darshan karne gayi hajaaron shraddhaluon kii jindagi ke saath kismat or mausam ne jo ghinauna majaak kiya wo cover karne jane vaale saikadon reportron main se main bhi ek tha
 However, when i reached Uttarakhand, it was the tenth day of this tragedy
 tab tak mote taur par rescue oparation puraa ho rahaa tha
 Thousands and millions of people were returning after saving their lives
 pahaado par chitkaar kam thi lekin jamini ilaakon main maaraa maari or tanaav bad rahaa tha
 In Dehradun, Haridwar and Rishikesh, thousands of families were searching for their loved ones running from the hospital to the bus station, stations and airports, as if it were late, it would be lost forever in the race for life
 das-gyaarah din tak jab aapako apane maa-baap, bete-beti, bahan-bhai yaa bivi-bacchon ke bare main koi khabar naa mili to mere khyaal se aapkaa yaa meraa bhi yahi haal hota
 Afratfari was spread
 sabhi apane rishtedaaron ke bare main sabase pehle jaan lenaa chaahate the
 All limits of patience were broken
 ab gussa gaharaa rahaa tha
 Angry with the government, angry with the administration, angry with God, even angry with the media
 pehle hi din kuch ugr tatwon ne ajtak ke cameraman par jaanaleva hamalaa isliye kar diya ki media unke rishtedaaron kii tasviir nahin dikhaa rahaa tha
 Without thinking, 6 stitches came on the face of my colleague Nadeem in this deadly attack
 nadeem yaa mere saathi kumaar abhishek, pinaki sen yaa mujhe ehsaas tak nahin hua ki aakhir kyon or kaise ye sab hua
 But it was understood that Nadeem was treated in a government hospital
 gussai bheed kisi kii nahin sunati or ugr bheed ko bhadkane main kisi ko bhi vakt nahin lagata
 Perhaps taking advantage of this environment, some kind of khandak came out on my partner
 pehle din kii aisi shuruyaat ne pareshaan to kiya, lekin ye jaanane ke liye bhi uksaaya ki aakhir kyon ye hua? nadeem kii kya galati thi? aakhir use kiske gusse kaa shikaar hona padaa? kya ye gussa yaa khiz sarkaar ke khilaaf thi? aakhirkaar sarkaar kahaan he? prashasan kahaan he? aapadaa nahin roki ja sakati thi, lekin maraham tak lagane main sarkari amala kaise chook rahaa he? inhen kuch sawaalon or khayalon ke saath hamaara kaaravaan pahaado kii chadhaai naapane laga
 The journey that takes 4-5 hours from Rishikesh to reach Garhwal to Srinagar was completed in 7 hours because as the car was going upwards, pictures of the destruction were getting clear on the way
 sadaken jagah-jagah se tuuti padi thi
 Ten days after the accident, gradually the exercise of bringing life back on track with the help of the army was beginning to appear on the ground of reality
 border road organizeshan yani biaaro ke jawan is khaufnak manzar main apaana ghar-parivaar ko chhodkar jagah-jagah se tut chuki sadakon kii marammat main din raat ek kiye huye the
 Similarly, the young man Manjit Singh told us that the ground has become so raw and polished that we are getting seven days to make this piece of 200 meters and three times the heavy rain has destroyed all the hard work
 naa jane kab ham apana kaam puraa kar paaenge
 Having said this, he again gathers his comrades and gets involved in running the JCB once again
 paristhitiyaan saaf ho rahi thim
 Uttarakhand, the king of the mountains, was torn up
 tabaahi ke tandav kii durgandh saath bahati alaknanda se bhi rah rahakar aa rahi thi
 Don't know how many lives this life-giving river had taken
 meraa or mere sahyogi pinaki kaa to ye alam tha ki saath girte jharanon kaa pani pinaa to dur inamen haath lagane main dar lag rahaa tha
 Don't know which wonder fell from above
 khayr
 
 jivan he chalate rahane kaa naam
 We also walked and walked a lot
 prakriti ke tandav ke puure hone main do hafte kaa vakt ho rahaa tha
 The entire focus of army, government and administration was to save all the people trapped in the four dhams including Kedarnath
 jinamein zyaadaatar sailaani the or kuch sthaneey jo rojgaar ke chakkar main in jagahon par is sizan main pahunch jate the
 But due to this hospitality of the government, Uttarakhandis themselves were now provoking
 unhen khiz aa rahi thi ki sarkaar apano ke bich kyon nahin aa rahi he
 The way of Rudraprayag, Karnaprayag, Transit was not so much affected
 yahaan par itnaa zyada nuksaan bhi nahin hua tha
 But when we tried to go to the interiors such as narayana-baghdad, Tharali and Dewal, these three tehsils of Chamoli district were completely cut off from the main road
 in tak pahunchane ke liye hamane 5 jagahon par pahad par trek kiya or kachche raaston or phislan bhare raaston par trek karne kaa naa to hamen anubhav tha or naa hi koi taiyaari
 But when the local people, especially the women, were seen carrying 20 kg of grain and ration bags on their shoulders, it was not only encouraging but also the courage that we too can walk
 aise hi bipin naam ke 14 saal ke ladke se baat karte huye jab ham haaramani naam kii jagah par pahaad chadh rahe the to us bachche ne bataaya ki ghar main khaanaa khatm ho chukaa he
 Father has no idea, mother and younger siblings are very upset and hungry, so i am returning from my master's house which is 8 km away from here with some salmon
 bipin kii patharai ankhon main koi bhav nahin tha
 He just wanted to walk fast
 uski baaten sunakar meraa dil munh ko aa rahaa tha lekin mujhe laga is vakt vipin ke saath hamadardi dikhaakar use apni manzil se digaanaa thik nahin he
 And i kept quiet and Bipin stepped forward
 aisi naa jane kitni kahaniyaan milin
 Everyone has their own problems, their own stories, their experiences
 tharali hote huye deval tak pahunchane main hamaari himmat jawaab dene lagi thi
 But one thing remained the same all the way that our government is not coming to us
 siem yaa mantri to dur dm, esadm koi nahin hamaari sud lene aayaa
 Some fiery social workers even told us that because no one died in our areas, the administration is not taking care of us
 agar narayanabaggad or tharali jaise ilaakon main saikadon makaanon or dukaanon ke matiamet hone kii bajaay 10-20 log mare hote to haadase ke turant baad sarkari amala hamaare yahaan aa chukaa hota
 These people were now threatening the agitations
 inkaa dard yahaan tak phuta ki jab aaj tak kaa camera tamaam kachche raaston se hota hua yahaan aa saktaa he to dm or siem kyon nahin
 At the same time, people who are losing their entire homes in relief camps in government schools have different problems in front of them
 naa rahane ko sir ke upar chat bachi he or naa hi pair rakhane ko zamin
 Farms, houses, and shops have perished in the outbreak of the Pinder River
 pinder nadi ne saikadon saalon ke baad apana rasta bhi thik usee jagah par badla jahaan par sabase zyada aabaadi uske aasapaas rah rahi thi
 In compulsion Raja and Ranka were forced to sleep on the carriage in the same class
 yahaan rahane vaale pradhan, ashok ankal, pramila devi jaise tamaam logon ko ab ye dar sata rahaa tha ki jab skool khul jaayengen to ye jo asthaayee chat mili hui he usase bhi maharoom rah jaaenge
 And what will happen to the future of their children if the school does not open
 yani jaaen to jaaen kahaan
 All these incidents bother why
 in masuumon se kis baat kii naaraazgi nikaali kudarat ne
 But a mind also says that we ourselves are guilty
 ham hi ko to chaiye hota he river-vyuu vaala cameraa
 It is necessary to go to the mountains for a holiday
 saal main chaar nahin to do baar to pahaado par janaa hi he
 Squatting on the banks of the river, sitting there, eating and drinking, leaving dirt
 or ye kaam ham hi nahin hamaare jaise hajaaron log, har roj kar rahe hai
 So when we set up a seat on nature, the nature is not even heard
 in halaaton ko or bigaad diya sarkari kaamchori, sarkari bhrashtachar or hamaari beyimaan niyat ne
 Where there is random construction, illegal occupation of land
 or phir har tareeke se prakruti kaa dohan or shoshan taaki khud kii jeben jhamajham bhari rahen
 In such a situation, if governments are whipped then it is not wrong
 lekin ab vakt he hamako bhi apane girebaan main jhaankne kaa
 Don't do anything else but if you start honoring nature then the situation can be handled
 inhen tamaam aankalnon ke baad uttarakhand se ham laut aaye lekin 8 dinon main ye samajhnaa mushkil nahin tha ki khand khand huye is rajya ko aarthik or saamaajik taur par basaane main 5 se 7 saal kaa vakt lagegaa, tabhi ye rajya pragati ke raste par baaki rajyon ke saath pankti main khadaa ho paayegaa
