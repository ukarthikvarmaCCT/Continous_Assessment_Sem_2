 sarkaar ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki landan sthit ek santhaan kii report main samruddhi ke maamle main bharat ko 110 deshon kii suchi main 88wein sthaan par rakhaa gaya he
 Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation Minister Kumari Selja said India has been ranked 88 in the list of 110 countries in terms of prosperity in the London-based Legatum Institute's 'the 2010 Legatum Prospects Index' report
 unhone sushila saroj ke sawaal ke likhit jawaab main loksabhaa ko bataaya ki uniform ricol period ke aadhaar par rashtriya namoona surveykshan sanghathan ke aankade bataate hai ki varsh 1993-94 main shahari garibon kaa pratishat 32

 India constantly warns its neighboring country of Pakistan to take tough measures against terrorism and has been asking them to stop supporting terrorist activities
 ab pakistan ko yahi chetavanee vishwa jagat se bhi mili he
 The 2017 report of the Frazile States Index places Pakistan in the list of 20 unsuccessful countries that should worry about their own security
 ab pakistan ko duniya ke sheersh 20 frejail stats main shaamil hone ke baad yah samajhnaa hoga ki jis aatankwaad ko vah apane padosi desh bharat ko pareshaan karne ke uddeshy se istemaal karata rahaa he, vah khud uske liye nasoor ban chukaa he
 This is the index this indicates
 america kii PAK ko chetavaniamerica bhi pakistan ko aatankwaadi gatividhiyon par lagaam lagane or aatankwaad ko apni jameen se khatm karne ke liye kadi karrwai karne kii chetavanee detaa rahaa he
 Recently in the US House of Representatives, a resolution was also proposed to declare Pakistan as a terrorist country
 haal hi main bharat daure par aae america videsh mantri rex tilarsan ne pakistani netritv se sakht lahaze main kaha ki wo aatanki sanghathanon ke khilaaf karrwai kare, varanaa america khud pakistan ke khilaaf karrwai karegaa
 US President Donald Trump also said that Pakistan remains a safe haven for terrorists
 china tak hua sakhtitna hi nahin pakistan ke har kadam kaa samarthan karne vaale china ne bhi haal hi main beijing main sampann hue bricks sammelan ke sanyukt ghoshnaa-patr main pakistan ke kai aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke naam shaamil kiye the
 Which clearly indicates that China is also tightening its stance towards Pakistan and terrorism
 apni kabr khud khod rahaa pakvaswava main aantarik balon, virodhabhasi maansikta, sainya prabhutv, bhrashtachar or anupyukt netaaon, vibhinn rashtriyataon, bad rahi aabaadi, ghatate jal sansaadhan or bighad rahi aarthik sthitiyaan hi khud pakistan ke patan kaa kaaran ban sakati hai
 Pakistan ranks 18th in the Frazile States Index 2017
 sabase mjedaar baat yah he ki 2017 main pakistan ko is disha main sarvaadhik sudhaar karne vaala desh bataaya gaya he
 It means that despite the country which is trying to improve the most in the whole world, the situation of Pakistan is still very bad
 most frejail stats index 2017 kii report main haalanki yah bhi kaha gaya he ki pakistan main yah sudhaar sirf varsh-dar-varsh ke aadhaar par he
 It means that the situation in Pakistan is improving compared to last year, but it is not necessarily doing well in the direction of sustainable improvement
 hakeekat yah he ki pakistan tabaahi kii ore bad rahaa he
 If terrorists take hold of the country, it will be dangerous not only for Pakistan but also for the world
 pakistan ke shaskaon ko desh ko is khatre se bachaane ke liye vyapak niti banani chahie
 Legendary fast bowler Glenn mcgrath believes Australia's sacked cricket coach Mickey Arthur's allegations of racial prejudice and differences in the team are disappointing and prove that he did not care much for his team
 arthur ne pad se barkhaast kiye jane ke baad cricket australia par nasli pakshpaat kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 He also said that he found a team in which captain Michael Clarke and senior player Shane Watson never got along
 tippaniyan As mcgraw wrote in 'the Guardian', Arthur's statements are disappointing
 naslwad or jo unhone watasan ke bare main kaha, vah bahut anuchit he
 "I see Shane Warne saying that Arthur's statements prove that he does not care much about Australian cricket
" main isse sahamat hum
 If that's what they want to do, it depends on them
 main isse kaaphi maayoos hum or mujhe to lagata he ki yah jaanboojhkar li kiya gaya
 mcgraw also said that the Australians will overcome this and return to the current Ashes series
 unhone kaha, yah aisi sthiti he, jisamen team ekajute hoti he
 Many times when attempts are made to break the team, the result is reversed and the players are united
 ve ek-duusare kaa bachaav karne lagate hai
 Arthur had accused Australia of racial bias after being sacked from the post
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki unhen aisi team mili, jisamen captain maaikel clark or senior khilaadi shen watasan kii kabhi nahin patati thi
 The comments mcgra ne 'da gardian' main likhaa, arthur ke bayaan niraashajanak hai
 The racism and what he said about Watson is very unfair
 unhone kaha, maine dekha ki shen warn ne kaha he ki arthur ke bayanon se sabit hota he ki unhen australian cricket kii adhik parvaah nahin he
 i agree with this yadi vah yahi karnaa chaahate hai, to yah un par nirbhar karata he
 i am deeply disappointed by this and i think it was intentionally leaked
 mcgra ne yah bhi kaha ki australian isse ubarkar maujuuda ashes shrunkhlaa main vaapasi karenge
 He said, this is a situation in which the team unites
 kai baar jab team ko todane kii koshishen kii jaati he, to uskaa nateeja ulta hota he or khilaadi ekajute ho jate hai

 desh main kuch aise sabase amir mandir hai, jinke khajaane main saal dar saal badhotaree hoti ja rahi he
 This growing treasure of God is benefiting the devotees, because these rich temples of the country are sharing their wealth among the destitute and the poor
 in sabhi mandiron main shiridy ke sai baba sabase aage nikal gaye hai, jinhone siddhivinayak kaa bhi record tod diya
 As much wealth as there is in the court of Shirdi Sai Baba, so much is donated from the Sai temple
 shiridy sai mandir, tirupati balaji, siddhivinayak mandir or vaishno devi, ye chaar mandir chadhaave ke maamle main sabase upar hai
 In the last 4 years, devotees have offered more than 1000 crores to the Shirdi Sai temple, while Siddhivinayak in Mumbai has received an offering of Rs 206 crores
 shiridy mandir ne pichley 4 saal ke chadhaave main se 53 fisadi daulat kaa mahadaan kiya, to siddhivinayak ne pichley 4 saalon main khazaane kaa 13 fisadi charity main diya
 That is, Sai Baba has also broken the record in donating
 shiridy sai mandir, siddhivinayak mandir se mahadaan ke maamle main bhi aage nikal gaya
 If this is not a miracle in Sai's name, what else is there? There is such a belief among Sai Baba's devotees that the devotees are blessing Baba
 yahi vajah he ki har saal sai ke khazaane kaa nayaa record banataa he
 In the year 2012-13 too, Sai Baba got a record of wealth
 sai baba main unke bhakton kii atoot aasthaa he
 The number of Sai's devotees is increasing day by day
 is atoot aasthaa kaa nateeja he daulat, athaah sampatti, note hi note or maaya hi maaya
 It is said that what comes in Sai Baba's court does not go empty handed
 sai apane bhakton kii muraad sunate hai or bhakt prabhu ko maalamaal karte hai
 In 2012, the year 2011 record was broken
 haalanki 2011 main 2010 kaa record tutaa tha
 In 2011, there was an offering of 276 crores, which increased by about 30 crores this year
 sawaal shiridy sai mandir main chadhaave kaa nahin he, balki bhakton kii aasthaa or shraddha kaa he, jo sai kaa aashirwad banakar bhakton par baras rahi he

 Because the CIC does not have the right to run a contempt case, the Supreme Court should interfere in this matter
 unhone kaha ki in partiyon ko kaaphi madad milti he
 Even they are exempted from income tax
 aise main in partiyon ko RTI ke daayre main laayaa janaa chahie
 Even the details of the donation given to the parties should be given
 bhushan ne kaha ki partiyaan 2 xxrep 4 0 se upar kii donneton ke bare me chunaav ayog ko bataati hai lekin usase neeche kii rakam kii jaankaree bhi di jaani chahie
 He said that investigation shows that 75 per cent of the donations received by these parties are less than 20 thousand

 Tribal women, who are equal in importance to men in the tribal life of Bastar, are ordinary housewives in domestic life, who help in farming, collect forest produce and go for sale in the haat-bazaars, deal with and handle children
 Huh
 haadtod mehnat or mushkil halaat main dhiraj in mahilaon kii khaas khubi he
 But because of this quality, these tribal women became important to the Maoists
 do dashakon se maovadi in adivasee mahilaon kaa kayapalat kiye de rahe hai, unke or ilaake ke achche ke liye nahin, balki ashubh or barbaadi ke liye
 These shy tribal women today are synonymous with awe as Maoist guerrillas and even more brutal than their male counterparts
 maovadi pichley kuch varshon se apni tukadiyon main adivasee auraton kii bhartee par khaas dhyaan de rahe hai
 Security forces estimate that about 4,000 Maoists of Bastar region have about 4,000 women
 inamen se sainik training praapt kareeb 2,000 adivasee auraten hathiyaarband chhapamar tukadiyon main shaamil hai
 These women guerrillas are committing heart-wrenching incidents
 haal ke arase main aisi kai vaaradaaten hui hai jinamein mahilaon ne maovadi chhapamaron ke daston kii aguai kii or suraksha javaanon ke saath acolpaneey krurta se pesh ain
 In the attack on October 23 in Netanar, Jagdalpur in which 6 soldiers were killed, Yogendra Soni, who narrowly survived, says that a large number of Maoists were also women
 ve golibari main ghayal javaanon ko maut ke ghat utaarne ke liye kulhadi lekar unki ore bad rahi thim
 That attack was led by Secretary of the Kanger Area Committee, Savitri
 khabar he ki police kii javaabi karrwai main savitri ghayal ho gai thim
 Earlier, on August 19, after the attack on the security force in Metlacheru, women Maoists brutally stabbed and killed soldiers wounded by bullets
 unhone marva gaye javaanon ke hathiyaaron ke saath hi unke gale main padi chen, anguthi, mobile or paise bhi lut liye the
 11 soldiers were killed in that attack
 20 june ko bijapur ke usoor main maovadiyon ke saath muthbhed main ghayal hue jawan rajesh singh bataate hai, ''maovadiyon main mahilaon kii taadaad kaaphi zyada thi
 They were not only shelling, but also instructing male comrades to attack
 unki netaa thi usoor miletry platoon kii akila
 "the landmine blast at Gatam in Dantewada on the night of June 10 was carried out by women guerrillas
 tab 10 jawan marva gaye the
 After the blast, the female Maoists not only killed the injured jawans in the vehicle with sharp-edged weapons but also removed the cartridges of their cartridges
 10 june ko hi tadake narayanpur ke jhara main chhattisgarh sashastr bal ke shivi par hue hamale kii ruparavkha east bastar diviginal cameti kii sachiv kamalesh ne taiyaar kii thi or ise cameti kii pravaktaa niti kii aguai main anjaam diya gaya
 5 soldiers were killed in this
 april 2010 main tarmetala main hue maovadiyon ke ab tak ke sabase bade hamale, jisamen siarpief ke 76 jawan maare gaye the, main mahila chhapamar badi taadaad main thim
 They killed the wounded jawans in the firing with a knife and looted their weapons
 us muthbhed main ek mahila maovadi maari gai thi
 Currently, out of the six divisional committee of Maoists in Bastar, two are in the hands of women
 vahiin duusari ikaayiyon main mahilaayein ek tihaai se zyada hai
 Secretary of North Bastar Divisional Committee, Sujata Narwati is considered to be the most dangerous among them

 Jha says that the tribal social system is liberal and women have equal status in it
 maovadiyon ne apni takat badhaane ke liye isi tathy ko bhunaaya
 In the beginning, there were only a few women in the ranks of the Maoists who generally avoided violence
 ek dashak pehle dantewada ke konta block ke andruni ilaake main ek jan adaalat main maovadiyon ne up sarpanch bhima kaa sir kalam kar diya tha
 Seeing this horrific scene, four women present there had fallen after eating a Maoist gush
 narayanpur ilaake main 1999 main mahila maovadi kamalkka or phulvati ke maare jane ke baad unki saathi sunita ne dehshat main kuch hi dinon baad aatmasamarpan kar diya tha
 But things have changed now
 maovadiyon ke shivi main dabish ke dauraan police ne jo dastavej baraamad kiye hai, unase pataa chalata he ki maovadiyon ne bastar kii adivasee mahilaon ko silsilewar tareeke se taiyaar kiya
 Maoists mobilized them by first creating a revolutionary tribal women's organization
 iske baad unhen jan chetana natya mandali ke jariye maowad ke prachaar kii jimmedaari di gai
 Then in political units, the task of provoking the tribals against the government was given
 aakhir main unhen kadi training ke baad sainya ikaayiyon main laayaa gaya
 The Maoists publish the monthly mouthpiece Struggling Women to feed ideological supplements to women active in their various organizations
 is patr se adivasee mahilaon ko duniyabar main hui sashastr kranti main mahilaon ke yogadan se waakif karavaaya jaataa he
 Educated Maoist women narrate to their illiterate peers the contribution of women guerrillas to the Kurdish rebellion, the proletarian women's movement in Norway and the role of women in the Nepal war
 maovadi antarrashtriya mahila diwas jor-shor se manaate hai or mahilaon kii raily karte hai
 Women guerrillas are trained in guerrillas and jungle warfare

 "maoists are forcibly recruiting tribal women into their organizations," says Langkumer
 or unki shaadi bhi jabardastee apane saathiyon se karvaa rahe hai taaki unke sanghathan ke purush sadsy apni ubaau dincharya se ukta kar unka saath na chhod den
 "but the surrendered Maoist couple Badranna and Latakka point out that while men and women belonging to the Maoists' military units can marry mutually, they are not allowed to have children
" badaranna-latakka ne isi kaaran shaadi ke baad maovadiyon se naata tod liya tha
 The exploitation of women members by Maoists often comes up
 lekin aatmasamarpan kar chuke local organijeshan ke commander ramesh urf bhima kaa daawa he ki maovadiyon ke sanghathanon main mahilaon ko barabari kaa darja hasil he
 a decade ago, Bhimanna, commander of the dreaded Maoist Basaguda Dalam, was separated from the organization on the complaint of misbehavior with the women of the village
 ab dhire-dhire hi sahi, paristhitiyaan badal rahi hai
 Nearly a dozen women guerrillas, who have changed their fundamental temperament after drinking the ideological cloak of the Maoists, have relieved the Maoists after being plagued by countless incidents of bloodshed
 lekin maovadi tukadiyon main auraton kii baari sankhya ke maddenjar is prakriya ko tej karne or adivasee auraton kii ghar vaapasi ke liye sarkaron, suraksha balon tathaa maovadi abhishaap ko jhel rahe sthaneey samaaj ko mail-milaap kii thos yojanaayen bana unhen amalijama pehanaanaa hoga

 Currently it was Rs 25 crore

 People were stunned after the girl's body was found in a sack in a residential area of shivpuri, capital of the country
 ghatana kii soochna milte hi maukey par panhuch kar police ne ladki kii laash ko apane kabje main le liya
 Police suspect the girl has been murdered and her corpse stuffed in a sack
 laash ke sadane se aa rahi thi tej badboobataya ja rahaa he ki buudhvaar subah kareeb nau baje dilli ke sagarpur ilaake main ek khaali plot main ek bori dikhaai di jisase tej badboo aa rahi thi
 On seeing the sack with strong smell, people suspected something untoward
 jiske baad unhone puure maamle kii khabar police ko di
 As soon as the information was received, police reached the spot as soon as the police reached the scene

 There was a dead body in this sack
 police ke mutabik laash bahut sad chuki thi or laash kii haalat dekhakar ye andja lagaaya ja saktaa tha ki uski maut koi aam maut nahin thi balki uskaa katl kiya gaya tha
 The death of the girl raises many questions
 jisko police sulajhane main lagi hui he
 Seeing the dead body, the police suspect that he was murdered by strangulation
 police ko is baat kaa bhi shaq he ki katl se pehle shaayad is ladki ke saath rape yaa kisi tarah kii koi jyaadati hui hogi

 kyonki jab tak ladki kii pahchaan saaf nahin ho jaati tab tak police ke liye kaatil tak pahunchnaa takreeban naammumkin he
 This is the reason that the police is closely investigating all the belongings and clothes recovered from the corpse, and at the same time it is checking in the police stations whether there is any missing case of a girl

 com / ryfeuzjac3 If the house is not clean then the risk of getting diseases increases greatly
 ghar ko saaf rakhane ke saath hi ye bhi jaruri he ki aap apane bistar ko bhi saaf rakhen
 Otherwise, there may be a risk of bedbugs in them
 aamtaur par log bistar ko lekar thode laaparvaah ho jate he lekin yakeen maniye bistar saaf rakhana utana bhi mushkil kaam nahin he
 If you want, you can keep your home bed clean by following these five easy ways: 1
 saptaah main kam se kam do baar bed cover or pilo cover badalanaa jaruri he
 If you have any problem related to hair, then you should change the pillow cover at least three times a week
 varanaa aapaki ye samasya or bad jaaegi
 With this, if someone else shares the bed with you, then they will also be at increased risk of contracting it
 2
 Choose the bed cover according to the season
 garmiyon main jahaan coton kaa bed cover istemaal karnaa behatar hoga
 For winter, it would be better to use silk or thick cloth bed covers
 haalanki silk kaa bed cover yaa phir koi bhi mote fabric kaa cover ganda adhik hota he kyonki isamen dhul baithti he or inhen dhonaa bhi thodaa mushkil hota he
 3
 roj subah uthne ke saath hi bed cover ko baahar le jaakar jhatak den
 So that all the dust and other dirt stored in it gets cleaned
 uske baad use salike se bistar par bicha lijie
 Clean the pillow cover in the same way every morning
 bed ke paas hi ek mat rakhentaaki bistar par baithne se pehle aap us par pair ponch saken
 4
 maheene main ek baar gaddon ko dhoop dikhaanaa bahut jaruri he
 This will prevent insects from growing in the mattresses and will not smell of any of them
 5
 In many homes, people start eating food only by sitting on the bed
 ye ek galat aadat he
 Eating food while sitting on the bed increases the possibility of getting the cover dirty, while on the other hand it is not good for health

 is niti par modi sarkaar ke kai faisle saraahneey rahe to kai par vipakshiyon ne jamkar sawaal uthaae
 By understanding some important decisions taken under foreign policy during the 3-year tenure of the Modi government, it can be decided that the decisions taken during the tenure of the government will have an impact on relations with other countries

 However, when Bhilare's colleague Mani Shankar Purohit was presented before the commission, he told that the incident took place in July 1947, not in 1944
 is ghatana main bhilaare kaa koi khaas zikr bhi nahin tha
 The Commission only came to know that in 1944, an atmosphere of unrest was created in the prayer meeting due to some people on that day
 mahatma gandhi kii hatya kii jaanch ke liye supreme court ke jaj jeke kapur ne 22 march 1965 ko ek kamishan banaaya

 He told that the incident was named after Gandhi's close associate Pyarelal Recorded from
 mehta ne bataaya ki gandhi ko maanane vaale chunnilaal mehta kii kitaab main bhi yah baat likhi gai he
 Bhilare followed Gandhi's principles throughout his life, freedom fighter and senior farmer and Labor Party leader ND Patil said, 'bhilare used to be a hero of youth like us in those days
 godse se gandhi ko bachaane vaali baat puure satara main fail gai thi
 Then i was 15 years old
 tab main or mere dost bhilaare guruji se milane saaikal se gaye the
 He followed the principles of ordinary living and Gandhi all his life

 thik aisa hi hua dilli ke 24 varshiya shekhar ke saath
 Shekhar might have never thought that he would get 600 gifts in exchange for buying a phone
 wo bhi aise gifts jinaki keemat 80,000 rupee tak he
 Actually something happened that oneplus and Amazon together had run a promotional campaign oneplus Lucky Star recently

 yani kul milakar aap ye kah sakate hai ki vanplus 6tii kharidne ke badale shekhar ko sab kuch diya gaya
 The amazing thing is that the list of 600 gifts includes up to the kitchen sink
 aapako bataa den 600 gift ko shekhar tak pahunchaana bhi aasaan nahin tha
 For this, a small truck was booked by Amazon and oneplus
 baat sirf yahaan tak nahin ruki oneplus 6T ko shekhar ko handover karne vanplus india ke general manager vikaas agarwal khud dilli tak aae
 Talking about the price of each gift, their range is from Rs 100 to Rs 80,000

 a girl in the village of Chambal
 thakuron ke ghar main paidaa hui
 The father wanted a boy
 chaah paidaa nahin hui, to jo hua, uske hisse ashleel dhang se jaij ho chuki berukhi ai
 Then, in the party ban of the village, the father was killed by another Thakur
 maaraa or phir vah thakur mritak kii aurat par ladki ke hi shabdon main kahen to chadhane laga
 The girl did not tolerate this hatred, and one day she fired all the bullets of the father's Sixer (six-round revolver) into the killer's body
 ye thi revolver rani alka singh (kangana ranot) kii asal paidaaish
 After this incident, his Balli Mama (piyush Mishra) came and took him with him to Dabra (a town in Madhya Pradesh)
 ab mamaa hi uske maa-baap the
 Mama neatly composed the array for 25 years

 jite udaibhaan singh tomars (jakir hossain), ek or bahubali
 But the Tomars had a tight end even after the victory
 24 murder thans chuki alka ne unke bhai ko maaraa or phir bhi chutta gum rahi he
 To take revenge, Tomar picks up Alka's Gudda or lover boy Rohan from Mumbai
 rohan vahaan alka ke paison par kathith rup se hero banane ke naam par aish kaat rahaa he
 Rohan was like a night queen in the Akkad forest of Alka
 usne to sochaa tha alka ko seedhi bananaa, magar alka ke bheetar kii aurat kaa pyaar is gabaru ko dekh umad padaa
 And when Lavar is near the enemy, Durga's inner Durga was sure to wake up
 yahaan se siyasat kii ek duusari hi bisaat bichhani shuru ho gai
 Tomar would hit back, then keep Bali Mama Alka in front

 Then when his land is moist in the latter half and the eyes of love and motherhood start erupting on it, then there is a dot of red sun on his forehead and waterfall in his eyes
 kamaal kii acting kii he is ladki ne
 My unhesitating advice to all the alleged actresses of Bollywood
 is ladki kaa kaam baar baar dekhen or seekhen
 Veer Das has also created a new idiom for Kamengi through his character
 pehali martabaa vah apane standap kamedian ke reel or real avatar ke baahar utre hai or acha kiya he
 As Balli Mama, Piyush Mishra weaves many nuances of that feudalistic relationship, which sometimes carries its intrigues with women through love and affection, sometimes by misbehavior
 vah kai baar gangs of vasepur kii bhi yaad dilaate hai, jo meri najar main ek clasik film thi
 The election of Zakir Hussain and other actors was also impressive
 yahaan main zikr karnaa chaahunga film main niyamit antaraal par aati or apane belos andaaj or samvaad se betarah hansaati actress mishka singh kaa
 He played the role of Priyanka Parihar, the anchor who reads the news in the spicy style of the local news channel
 film kii kahani kasi hui he
 The dialogs are shrouded in brass and shimmer for matt
 diarector sai kabir kii story-screenple or diarection ko dekhakar lagata hi nahin ki ye unki debyue film he
 There is action in the film, there is comedy, there is suspense and there are songs according to the situation, which does not let the feeling of the film lighten from anywhere
 gaanon par alag se baat kerani hi hogi
 Even if the review size increases
 ushaa utaap kii aawaaj main tital song revolver rani aata he or aap tarantino kii duniya main gote lagane lagate hai

 Revolver Rani's Thaya Thahanharfanmoula artist Piyush Mishra has coined the same pattern in other songs, Thayan Kare Thakka, Dhak Tani Se
 isamen aage line aati hai, randebaaji yahaan rani he thane revolver, ho bhaga romeo bechaara, dil lekar apana haath par
 It shows the condition of a mafia queen's doll
 isi tarah geeli mitti se bani murat sa gaanaa he, kaaphi nahin he chand, hamaare liye abhi, ankhen taras rahi hai tumhaare liye abhi, ham tanaha bekaraar nahin intjaar main, ye raat bhi rukii he tumhaare liye
 Now think, when Asha Tai sang this song, what tinkle would have been born on screen
 iske alaava aalha ke andaaj main aayaa gaanaa chal lade re bhaiya, din niklaa
 Chal Lade Re Bhaiya Dhoop Khili Khali reminds me of Omkara
 film main desaj andaaj kaa gaanaa bhi he, jiske bol hai
 Look at Banna Ji Re to come to Alka

 film kii tagaline he, ab mard ko dard hoga
 Its apparent intent is that a merciless bloodthirsty woman will take revenge from the time of bloodshed
 magar nahin, in shabdon ke garbh main ek or arth bhi chupa he
 The man will be in pain and should also be watching this black comedy, Tragedy
 dard ki kaise ek aurat jab tak mohara bani rahati he, use singhaasana kaa bharam diya jaataa rahata he
 But as soon as she gets her snout off in real form, the men start feeling scared
 ve sab lamaband ho jate hai, uski aazaadee or armaanon kii kabr khodne ke liye
 Revolver is not just a film that looks like a queen
 ye kai simton main hamaare vakt kaa, hamaare samaaj kaa aakhyaan he or postmortem se nrushans magar jaruri dhang se kaale sach kii cheerfaad karti he
 Since there are bullets and abuses in the film, it may not prove to be a very good option in terms of going with the family
 magar meri soch he ki ye goliyaan or gaaliyaan hamaare samay kii sachai hai
 When you really cannot avoid them, then what to do on the screen
 vaise bhi sensor board kii beep kathith sanyam ko barkaraar rakhti he
 See revolver queen ye lagaataar samrudh hote hindi cinema kaa ek nayaa or bharosa jagaane vaala paaydaan he

 chhattisgarh ke sukama zile main bade gurbe gaanv ke ytaram mandavi ko police ne somvaar shaam ko giraftaar kar liya
 Ayataram was involved in the movement against the arrest of tribals in Tongpal police station for the last few days
 ytaram pichley saal disambar main surkhiyon main aayaa jab ye khulaasa hua tha ki chhattisgarh police nirdosh adivaasiyon ko naksali samarthak bataakar jabaran sarender karvaa rahi he
 Aitaram Mandavi at the time gave an interview to NDTV India, stating that he had been hiding in villages for several days to avoid the 'surrender' of the police and when the police could not catch him, he picked up his wife
 haalanki chhattisgarh ke dijipi ne in aaropon se inkaar karte huye ytaram ko naksali samarthak bataaya tha
 At the time, Aitaram was protesting with more than 6 thousand tribals at Tongpal police station
 ye virodh pradarshan kolmakonta gaanv ke niwali muchaaki badma kii giraftaar ke virodh main ho rahaa he
 Tongpal and k police in-charge Shishupal Singh expressed their inability to give any information to NDTV India and Kukanar police in-charge Prakash Rathore only said that five cases have been registered against Aitaram Mandavi at his police station
 udhar yta kii vakil ne enditivi india ko bataaya, ‘police ne ytaram ko mangalvaar ko sukama kii adaalat main pesh kiya
 a total of 6 cases have been framed by the police, including those for committing disturbances and digging of roads in the panchayat elections

 According to the police officer, Abhijitshindeki's wife has been living with her mother for 3 months

 Khalil Gibran seems great philosopher in his writing, so also thinker and thinker
 jivan ko kareeb se dekhnaa or apane vichaaron se samoochee maanavtaa ko disha dena unki takat rahi he
 But he also understands love, he should write such excellent poems on it
 
 
 ise vahi samaj saktaa he, jisane sachcha prem kiya ho yaa khalil jibran ko duubakar padhaa ho
 It is not surprising that Khalil Jibran, like Buddha, influenced Osho with his sayings, thoughts and poems
 sahitya ajtak ke pathakon ke liye khalil jibran kii prem par likhi do shreshth kavitaayen-prem1
 Love is not control over anyone, love is control over someone
 Then Alimitra said, tell us about love, then he raised his head and looked at those people peacefully for all of them, then he said in a serious voice, become a follower as soon as love is indicated
 He though his paths are hard and inaccessible, and when his arms surround you surrender, though the sword hidden in his wings you Can Luhan, then Biawr when he can appear in words Housmen believe Rkhohalanki his words Kotar-wire your dreams Hanjase gives Kobrbad North icy wind park
 kyonki prem yadi tumhen samraat bana saktaa haito tumhaara balidaan bhi le saktaa he
 Love sometimes gives expansion, but sometimes it cuts
 jaise vah, tumhaare shikhar tak uthta haior dhoop main kaanpati komaltam shakhatak ko bachaata havaise hi, vah tumhaari gaharaai tak utarataa haior jameen se tumhaari jadon ko hilaa detaa honaj ke pula kii tarah,vah tumhen ikattha karata he apane lievah tumhen yantra main daalata he taakitum apane aavaran ke baahar aa jaao
 He filters you and frees you from your mantle, he grinds you to make you brighter
 vah goondhata he tumhen, naram banane takaur tab tumhen apni pavitra agni ko saunpta haijahaan se tum ishwar ke paavan bhoj keepavitra roti ban sakate ho!prem yah sab tumhaare saath karegataaki tum hriday ke rahasyon ko samaj sakoor is 'gyaan' se hi tupastitv ke hriday kaa ansh ho jaaoge
 But if you are afraid and you just want peace and joy in love, then it would be good for you to cover your 'privacy' and get out of that torture place of love, go into that world where your full joy in your laughter does not appear
 Your whole tears flow in your blood, love neither gives anything other than itself, nor does love take anything other than itself Rem just love to have no control over Rktan would have any control over love Hacunki love is enough
 jab tum prem main ho, yah mat kahoki ishwar mere hriday main hambalki kaho ki'main ishwar ke hriday main hum'
 Do not think that you can show love its path, but if love finds you worthy, it will itself tell you your path
 Apart from the fullness of 'self', there is no other desire for love but if you love yet have desires, then transform them in such a way that they melt Like a waterfall, you are singing in a melodious voice, for the night, understand the pain of the excesses of compassion, from the feeling of love
 Let your blood be wounded, let your blood be happy and awake in the heart of your own heart, be able and happy for a warm and fulfilling day for a warm and fulfilling day of love and return to the house with gratitude in the evening
 And the lips of the lips were praised
 - mul rachanah khalil jibran- anuwaadah vijayalakshmi sharma2
 When love calls you, go with it, even if its path is hard and extremely difficult
 or jab uske pankh tumhen apane main samet len, unamem samaa jaao
 However the sword hidden in its wings can injure you
 or jab wo tumse mukhaatib ho, us par vishwaas karochaahe uski awaz tumhaare sapanom ko aise bikher kyon na dejaise uttari hawa bagiche ko barbaad kar detii he
 If love crowns you, it will also hang you on the cross, if it makes you big, it will also trim you
 jaise yah tumhaari oonchai tak pahunch kar suraj main kaanp rahi narm shakhaon ko sahalaata he,vaise hi yah tumhaari jadon tak utar kar unhen zamin se hilaa bhi detaa he
 It covers you like the pools of maize, codifies you to expose
 yah tumhen tumhaare chhilkon se azaad karata he
 It grinds you to lightness, it makes you knead until you are done
 or tab yah tumhen uski pavitra aag main jhonk degaa,taaki tum bhagwaan kii pavitra daavat main uski pavitra roti bano
 All these things will give you love so that you can know the secrets of your heart, and this knowledge will become a piece of the heart of life
 par yadi tum apane dar main sirf prem kii shanti or prem kaa sukh talashoge,tab phir tumhaare liye acha hoga ki tum apni nagnata ko dhak loor pyaar kii pisane vaali zamin se nikal jaao
 You will laugh in a weatherless world, but you will not laugh and cry, but your whole tears will not give love except yourself and will not take anything from yourself
 prem niyantran nahin rakhata na hi ise niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he;prem ke liye prem main hona kaaphi he
 When you are in love then you should not say 'god is in my heart' you should say 'I am in the heart of God
 ’or yah nahin socho kii tum sidhaa prem tak ja sakate ho,prem ke liye, yadi vah tumhen amol paayegaa to sidhaa tum tak aa jaayegaa
 There is no desire except love to complete oneself
 par yadi tum prem karte hoor khwaahish karnaa jaruri ho to, inhen apni khwaahish banaao:pighalo or ek choti si nadi kii tarah bahojo raat ko apana sangeet sunaati he
 Know the pain of too much love
 swayan ke prem kii samaj se swayan ko ghayal karo;or khushi-khushi apane ko lahooluhaan kar do
 Wake up in the morning with an open heart and say thank you for another good day; Relaxing in the evening and meditating on the joy of love; Return home with gratitude; And then go to sleep with a prayer for those dear ones in your hearts
 Live and sing the song of love on your lips

 But everything failed
 jaise jaise samay beetaa hamaara rishta aage badha or us rishte main dikkatein aane lageen
 Both of us had given 100 percent to this relationship, but in the end we were separated

 Now Pietersen was in complete dormancy but the crisis was deepened by losing wickets in consecutive overs from the 12th to the 17th over
 tippaniyan Pietersen could not take advantage of Jeevandan and Maurice rectified his mistake by dismissing him on the first ball of the 17th over
 iske saath hi dilli kii haar sunishchit ho gai
 New batsman Quinton de Kock (11) pulled the ball to Yadav after two fours, which was converted into a catch by Unmukt Chand, standing at deep midwicket

 More than Seth is a businessman
 bundi main unka nijee makaan or gaadi bhi he
 He is also the President of the Kobal Trade Association, Bundi
 logon ke jivan main paras pathar kaa role adaa karne vaale or ek bade badlaav ke srujak cobal se judi kamyaabi kii asli kahaniyon kii bundi main koi kami nahin he
 Till a decade and a half ago, the pieces of sandstone which were considered as waste in the mining areas of the state, are raining gold today
 aakhir aisa kya hua jo kachra sona barasaane laga? is badlaav kii kahani us samay se shuru hoti he jab kuch deshon ne sadaken, footpath banane ke saath hi kai dusron kaamon main cobal kaa prayog karnaa shuru kiya, jisase iske niryaat main ijapha hone laga
 In the current era, demand has increased tremendously in many European countries including Germany, France and Belgium and in Bangladesh
 yahi vajah he ki bundi ke daabi or budhpura ilaake main cobal banane ke udyog ne bada rup akhriyaar kar liya he
 Cobal changed people's lives, even right
 lekin sawaal paidaa hota he ki aakhir yah cobal he kya bhalaa? aam taur par khadaanon se sandstone nikaale jane ke baad pathar ke kuch aise tukade batch jate hai, jinaki tiles nahin ban paati
 Some time ago, these pieces of stones were considered garbage and buried with debris
 is vajah se, khanan vaale ilaakon main malbe ke bade-bade pahaad khadey ho gaye the
 But in 1990, Chandraprakash Mandovara laid the foundation of the cobble business by making cobble and by 1992 it started being exported overseas
 nami vaale sthanon par in tukdon se sadak or footpath banaae gaye
 If their use was successful in many countries, then these pieces also came out
 maujuuda samay main chah guna chah inch aakaar ke cobal ko kating karke niryaat kiya ja rahaa he
 Apart from these, cobbles are also prepared in four to five small and big sizes, which is in great demand
 bundi, bhilwara or aasapaas ke ilaakon main cobal vyapaar kii neenv rakhane vaale divangat chandraprakash ke bhai rameshwar mandovara or vishaal mandovara (si
 P
 mandovara ke putr) is vyapaar ko paravaan chadha rahe hai
 Vishal says, "dad went to a fair in Europe in the nineties, where a foreign buyer gave him the idea to make sandstone cobbles
" bharat aane ke baad ve apana kaam chhodkar jaipur se karigar laakar grenite kii tarj par cobal banane kaa prayog karne lage
 The first container was shipped to Belgium in 1993
 iske baad videshon main aisi maang badi ki salanaa ek hajaar se zyada container france, belgium or germany sahit kai europea deshon main bheje jate hai
 "now Vishal, his tauji Rameshwar Mandovara and his son are handling this business
 cobal nirmaan sangh, bundi ke adhyaksh rajkumaar bulachandani bataate hai ki jile ke khanan kshetra se prati maah takreeban 1,000 trek maal nikal jaataa he
 a truck carries approximately 28 tons of goods
 ve bataate hai, ''cobal kii sthaneey dar 1,200-1,300 ru
 Per tonne, while its price abroad is Rs
 4,500
 prati ton se zyada he
 "cement blocks are in practice for pavement construction in our country
 lekin videshon main cobal kii zyada maang he
 In countries with high water and below zero temperatures where frequent road breaks are common, the use of cobble has led to good results
 rajya ke is puure sambhag khaskar bundi main cobal kaa nirmaan or niryaat shuru hone se logon kaa jivan vaaki badla he
 The 'mango kernels of mango prices' is also being applied well because the waste left after the original mineral material is proving to be gold
 isane paryaavaran sangrakshan ke kshetra main bahut badi madad kii he
 The piles of artificial mountains of debris in this area are now becoming smaller
 pichley das saal main yahaan itane dher lag gaye ki jagah hi nahin bachi thi
 Due to this waste, many small entrepreneurs have also flourished after big mining businessmen who are buying this waste from the mine owners and making silver by cutting the silver
 hajaaron hastshilpiyon, pathar kaatane waalon or mazdooron ko bhi isse rojgaar mila he
 One such person is Kedar Gupta, who is the secretary of the Cobal Trade Association, Bundi
 ve san 2000 se pehle tak ek stone company main incharge ke taur par kaam karte the, unhen gujaarey laayak pagaar hi mila karti thi
 What he came up with in the cobble business changed his entire life
 ab unke budhpura or kota main offis hai or salanaa turnover ek karod ru
 Has crossed ve kehete hai, ''cobal vyapaar main niryaat badhane se mehnat kaaphi kam ho gai he or jidangi kaaphi aasaan hoti ja rahi he
 "about 100 crore rupees only for cobbles in Bundi's Meerut area and Bhilwara region
" kaa salanaa kaarobaar hota he
 The funny thing is that in the first three years Cobble was royalty free
 phir 1998 ke aasapaas 5 ru
 Royalty commenced from Rs per ton, now Rs 75
 prati ton par pahunch gai he
 Last year the limit was reduced when the government gave it 150 rupees
 prati ton kar diya
 But after the 45-day agitation in January 2011, the government had to reduce rates
 bulachandani kehete hai, ''cobal kii roylty dar zyada he
 The rate of cobble should be lower than that of the original mineral
 alabatta cobal par cell tex maaf he
 The work of making cobble in Bundi and Kota is going on in a big way
 bundi ke chote-se budhpura gaanv main 35 se zyada stock (khule godaam) hai
 "the mine owners have also benefitted greatly from this
 ab ve apni samasya ke samaadhaan kaa bhi phayda lene lage hai
 How good? Earlier, raw material (floor) was available free of cost for a decade
 khan maalikon ko bhi malbe ke pahaad se chhutkaaraa paanaa hota tha
 But due to increasing demand for cobble, they have also started taking advantage of the opportunity to recover the cost of waste
 bakaul rameshwar mandovara, ''khushi kii baat yah he ki maal (cobal) kii jabardast maang he
 So that 60 per cent of the orders are pending
 ''kachare ko sone main kaise badla jaataa he iskaa sabak bundi or kota ne cobal ke jariye bakhubi sikh liya he
 Now there have been many exporters of cobble here, while one lakh laborers are also getting employment

 The Spanish authorities have arrested a total of 34 people, including seven tennis players, for fixing tennis matches
 sthaneey police ne yah jaankaree di he
 Maria Jimenez, spokeswoman for the Civil Guard, Spain's national and military police force, told a press conference that all seven players arrested were men and ranked 30th to 360th in Spain's national tennis rankings
 vahiin, atipi world ranking main yah khilaadi 800 se 1400 ke bich hai
 Imprisonment can be imprisoned for six to four years, Jimenez said that the players arrested in this case can be imprisoned for six months to four years
 iske saath hi ve lambey samay tak pratibandh kaa saamana bhi karnaa pad saktaa he
 The anti-fraud and monthly laundering task force of the Civil Guard in Madrid began an investigation in February last year
 unhen tennis integrity unit (itiu) kii ore se match phixing ke sandarbh main kuch sanket mili the
 According to Jimenez, some players have accepted the matter of match fixing due to fear
 hatya kaa maamla dilli ke conot place kaa hearopiyon se 14 mobile or 2 laptop baramadadilli police ne mahaj 12 ghante main katl ke maamle ko sulajhaate hue 2 aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The case is of Connaught Place, the heart of Delhi
 darasal conot place ilaake main ek yuvak kii hatya kar di gai thi
 Police have arrested 2 accused for murder
 in donon aropiyon ke paas se police ne14 mobile phone or 2 laptopbramad kiye hai
 According to police, the names of the accused are Maggi and Prem, who live in Mandavali area of delhi
 lekin aksar ye donon der raat main conot place ke bangala sahib gurudware ke paas bane celter home main jabaran ghus jate the or vahiin apni raat bitaate the
 Praveen, a young man living in the same shelter home, was opposed to them
 isi baat se naaraaz hokar ravivaar ke der raat in donon ne praveen par chaaku or eent se waar kar uski hatya kar di
 According to New Delhi's DCP Ish Singhal, the police have arrested the accused on the basis of CCTV and statements made in the injured state of the deceased
 inke paas se jo samaan baraamad kiya gaya he uske aadhaar par police is baat kaa pataa laga rahi he ki ye donon aaropee kahin lutere to nahin hai yaa kisi anya krime main lipt to nahin he
 Because 14 mobile phones and 2 laptops have been recovered from them
 isse shaq ho rahaa he ki ye aaropee or gatividhiyon main bhi lipt ho sakate hai
 Eventually Arvind Kejriwal became the Chief Minister of Delhi
 yah ek aisi ghatana he jiske bare main aaj se teen maheene pehle sochaa bhi nahin ja saktaa tha
 This is a major revolt against the current political system
 yah bhrashtachar, jadta or upeksha ke khilaaf ek shankhanaad he jiskaa swar dur-dur tak guunjega
 The public is paramount, politicians are forgetting this
 thode se samay main bani janata kii sarkaar aaj satta par asin he
 This is a big auspicious day for democracy because today the whole world is seeing its shine
 ab arvind kejariwal ke saamne chunautiyon kaa pahaad he
 It is not an easy task to maintain the light of the millions of hopes that they have lit before the public
 har aadmi ko aam aadmi se kaaphi ummiden hai or ab dekhnaa he ki arvind kejariwal kaise use puraa kar pate hai
 He has kept many such things in his manifesto which he will have to undergo fire test every time he completes
 dusron ke samarthan par tiki yah sarkaar kitna kuch kar paaegi, yah dekhnaa dilchaspee or khushi kaa vishay ho saktaa he
 Delhi is actually a semi-state with no police and land rights
 yahaan har bada faisla lene ke liye har baar kendra sarkaar se anumati leni padati he
 In such a situation, how will the big promises to improve law and order and provide roof to millions of forced people living in slums will be fulfilled? How will thousands of sweepers of loss-making municipal corporations be regularized? What will be the way to control inflation? Now Arvind Kejriwal too has taken a vow that he has no magic wand
 matlab saaf he ki logon ko apni samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye intazaar karnaa hi hoga
 Now the problem starts from here itself
 jo log sab kuch chhodkar aam aadmi party main shaamil hue the, ve kitne din tak intazaar kar paaenge? unke sabar kaa baandh kitne dinon tak bandhaa rahegaa? sach to yah he ki yah sab vipakshi dalon ke ravaiye par nirbhar karegaa
 Much will depend on how long they allow the government to run and how they allow it to run
 baharhaal is nai or ek krantikari kism kii sarkaar kaa swaagat he
 We can only hope that the new CM Arvind Kejriwal will show some good by doing less sources and in less time

 After the advisory of the Central Government, Amarnath Yatri and tourists are leaving the valley in a hurry

 Mehbooba Mufti targeted the central government, saying that travelers, tourists and students have been asked to leave Kashmir, not trying to give relief to Kashmiris
 mahabuuba mufti ne pradhanmantri modi par nidhaana sadhate hue kaha, kahaan gai insaaniyat, kashmiriat or jamhuriyat?evacuate yatris, tourists, labourers, students & cricketers
 Willingly create a sense of panic & distress but don't bother giving Kashmiris a sense of relief or security
 Kahan gayi insaniyat, kashmiriyat aur jamhooriyat?https: / / t

 jammu kashmir kii purv mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne kaha ki ham centre sarkaar ko ye bataanaa chaahate hai ki dhara 370 or anuchhed 35e se chhedchhad karne ke nattejey bahut khatarnaak honge
 We tried to talk, but there is no response from the Indian government
 log ghabaraae hue hai
 The government does not want to talk
 mahabuuba mufti ne kaha, centre sarkaar ko is par safai deni chahie
 We had decided to sit and talk to all regional parties
 isliye hamane hotel main baithne kaa faisla kiya tha
 The police have issued advisory to the hotel and prohibited the meeting of political parties
 isliye hamen hotel se meeting radd kar shaam 6 baje apane ghar par rakhni padi

 In Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir, terrorists hurled grenades at security forces, killing a civilian and injuring a CRPF jawan

 ) Be sure to think once before talking to beautiful women, because talking with beautiful women can turn the minds of men
 ek naye adhyayan main is baat kaa khulaasa kiya gaya he ki khubasurat mahilaon se baat karne ke dauraan purushon ke dimag kii batti gul ho jaati he
 Men tend to be very mindful while talking
 In Holland, researchers found that when a man talks to an attractive woman, it really turns his brain light
 is adhyayan main jo nateeja nikalakar saamne aayaa he, vah un logon ke kaam kaaj par apana asar jarur dikhaa saktaa he jo kaarysthal par mahilaon ke saath ‘flert’ karte hai
 According to the report published in 'the Daily Telegraph', the researchers said that the reason may be that a man puts too much brain while talking to beautiful women and thus has little energy left to do other tasks
 mahilaon par nahin padataa koi asariske vipareet aakshark purushon ke saath baatcheet karne se mahilaon par koi asar nahin padataa he
 Men think more about opportunities ahead
 is vajah se unke saath aisa hota he
 Studies show that a man who spends a few minutes with a beautiful woman in a company does less well than a man who spends time with a normal-looking woman
 radbound vishvavidhyalay ke adhyayankartaaon ne bataaya he, ‘‘nishkarsh ke rup main ham kah sakate hai ki kisi aakshark mahila se baat karne ke baad purushon ke maansik pratikriya main asthaayee taur par kami aa sakati he
 '' karnataka chunaav main vaise to bijepi sabase badi party banakar ubhari he
 But that magic figure is still 4 steps away from 112
 aise main sarkaar banane ke liye bijepi kii raah bhi aasaan nahin he
 In fact, if the Congress + JDS figures reach 112, then to curb the BJP, the Congress will give its strength on the formula
 pehla congress chaahegi ki sabhi gile-shikave bhulaakar jedies use samarthan kar de
 In this episode, if the JDS disagrees on the name of Siddaramaiah, then the Congress will seal the jd-like Congress CM without delay
 doosraa formula ye he ki jedies bhi kareeb 40 siten jitati dikh rahi he, or congress pichley chunaav ke mukaable is baar kamjor hui he
 In such a situation, if the JDS presents its claim to the Chief Minister, then the Congress can also consider this, because even though the JD (S) will hold the cm's chair, the Congress will succeed on its strategy
 congress har haal main bijepi ko satta se dur rakhana chaahati he
 Since Monday, the Congress has joined plan-b to form the government in Karnataka
 isi kadi congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad or ashok gahalot somvaar ko hi bengalooru pahunch gaye
 It is being said that the Congress is in touch with JDS chief and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda
 lekin congress ko sarkaar banane yaa phir sarkaar main bhagidaar banane kaa mauka tabhi milegaa, jab bijepi apane dam sarkaar nahin bana paaegi
 Also if the JDS refuses to support the BJP
 lekin philhal jab tak puure aankade nahin aa jate tab tak keval kayaas hi lagaae ja sakate hai
 Meanwhile, BJP has also started working on plan-b as well
 agar bijepi bahumat se kuch dur rahati he to pehle nirdaleey vidhayakon ko saath lekar sarkaar banane kii koshish hogi
 But even if the figures are not taken with independent mlas, it will be necessary to bring JDS with them
 isi kadi main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se mulaakaat ke baad kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar bengalooru ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye hai
 However, BJP had earlier indicated that it is not avoiding JDS

 Rahul Gandhi started this data war between Congress and BJP on Sunday through one of his tweets
 rahul ne twit kiya, ‘meraa naam narendra modi he
 i am the Prime Minister of India
 jab aap mere ap kaa istemaal karte hai, to main aapse jude data ko america companiyon main mere doston ke paas bhej detaa hum
 The source of this tweet by Rahul Gandhi was another tweet by the name of Elliot Anderson
 somvaar ko bijepi iti cell ke pramukh amit malviya ne rahul gandhi ke twit kaa jawaab dete hue twit kiya, ‘meraa naam rahul gandhi he
 i am the president of India's oldest party
 jab aap mere ap kaa istemaal karte hai, to main aap se jude data ko singapore main apane doston ke paas bhej detaa hum
 The source of this tweet by Amit Malviya was also the tweet by Elliot Anderson
 sawaal he ki koun he iliyat anderson? darasal iliyat anderson america drama thriller mistar robot kaa pramukh kirdaar he
 In this serial, an actor named Rami Malik has played the role of cyber security engineer and hacker
 serial kii script ke mutabik vah neuyark main rahata he
 According to an important dialogue of this serial, "I am a hacker at night and a normal cyber security engineer by day
 
 
 "
 Read this: Facebook data leaks: Ravi Shankar Prasad targeted Rahul, asked- Why remained silent for 5 months? Therefore, citing this common source, BJP and Congress are working to accuse each other
 donon bijepi or congress ke pravaktaa apni press conference tak main iliyat anderson kaa naam le rahe hai
 But, did he even notice that his common source is Elliot Anderson? Who, according to Elliot Anderson's Twitter account, is the French security researcher as well as the founding CEO of an institution called Affociity
 khaas baat yah he ki epasocity bhi iliyat anderson ke naam kii tarah ek kaalpanik sanstha he
 This institution is also present in the same American serial Mr
 Robot as an intelligence organization
 gauratlab he ki beete kai dinon se iliyat anderson donon raajnneetik dalon se sambandhit vishyon par lagaataar twit kar rahaa he
 Along with this, Eliot is also answering the questions being asked by some people including the media via email

 So to communicate with him, one needs to mail to the Gmail account given by him
 apane isi samvaad main usne apni pahchaan ek french android develper ke taur par kii he or apana naam baptist robert jaahir kiya he
 Significantly, Elliott had earlier questioned the security of India's Aadhaar app
 iske alaava beasenel, petm, india post, airtel jaisi companiyon kii suraksha main sudhaar robert kii aapatti ke baad kiya gaya he
 On Sunday, when the case of data breach came up in India, Elliott claimed that the work of collecting and sending data through the Namo app without user's permission is being done
 vahiin congress party ke ap par iliyat ne sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki is ap ke nijee data ko baahar bheja ja rahaa he
 This private data is encoded but is not encrypted
 iliyat ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki congress apane ap kaa data singapore sthit company ko achtitipi ke madhyam se bhej rahi he
 Till now both the BJP and the Congress have made a charge of blaming each other only on the basis of Elliot aka Robert's claims
 vahiin anya kai maamalon main robert dwaara uthaae gaye sawaalon ke baad suraksha ke pukhta kadam uthaae gaye hai
 Robert has also admitted that Namo's team contacted him after objecting to the Namo app, but no such attempt has been made by the Congress

 salmaan, salmaan, salmaan
 
 
 These 3 things will be seen in Dabangg 3 for 2 hours and 45 minutes
 isliye ye tay he ki agar aap salmaan ke fain hai to film main aapako koi kami najar nahin aane vaali he
 But if you are waiting for the release of a great film to make the weekend great, then go steady, this film will cook in your mind
 is baat ko samajhane ke liye salmaan kaa hi dialog kaaphi he ki ham dil main aate hai samaj main nahin
 Story of the film: The film's story begins with Inspector Dhakad Pandey (salman Khan)
 jo baad main chulbul pandey ban jaataa he
 The story of the film has a flashbag like the previous Dabangg part
 isliye film ko sidhaa samajhe to ek aam sa ladkaa jo superfeit he lekin gharavaalon ke liye nakaara he
 Her mother and father love her a lot, but Sulochana Mausi, who is present in the house, only taunts
 dhakad kaa ek bhai he makkhi (arbaj khan) jo apane bhai ke kehane par hi chalata he
 The story moves forward and Dhakad falls in love with Khushi (sai manjrekar)
 donon ke parivaaravale shaadi ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 But then Kali (kicha Sudeep) gets an eye on Khushi
 wo use ek tarafa pyaar karata he lekin jab use dhakad or khushi ke pyaar kaa pataa chalata he to khushi samet puure parivaar ko dhakad ke saamne maar detaa he
 But the trial goes on and on and gets punishment
 is bich jail ke senior officer kii najar dhakad par padati he or wo dhakad ko jhuthe aaropon se bari karaane ke saath use ek pulisavaala banaate hai
 Here Dhakad Pandey's form changes and he becomes Chulbul Pandey
 chulbul pandey apana badla puraa karne ke liye bali ko khai se phenk kar maar dete hai
 Then comes the jump in the story, Chulbul meets Rajjo (sonakshi Sinha)
 donon pyaar karte hai phir shaadi, unka ek betaa bhi hota he, jisaki umr 6 saal ke kareeb hoti he
 But there is a further entry of Bali in the story, which is not even mentioned in the film how it survived
 ek din bali or dhakad donon phir takaraate hai
 Bali too has not forgotten its revenge
 use lagata he ki khushi ko chulbul ne chhina he
 Chulbul's chronic pain wakes up
 bali pehle se zyada galat kaam karata he
 Chulbul Pandey swears to eliminate him, but how will he end? Or Bali will survive again, this is the climax of the film
 adaakaarifilm main salmaan khan apane puraane andaaj main pehle se kahin zyada jawan najar aa rahe hai
 Salman's style of acting is old but his entry in a domineering manner on the screen compels the audience to whistle and clap
 film main sonakshi apane rajjo ke kirdaar main pehle kii tarah he
 Although he played the character of Dabangg's wife
 chulbul kii premika bani sai manjrekar kaa film se debyue hua he
 Sai has done well in the role of a straightforward girl
 film main villen ke role main kichcha sudeep ne shandaar kaam kiya he
 Kitchha Sudeep has portrayed a villain like Bali in front of a hero like Dabangg
 film main kai saporting artist hai, arbaj khan, nawab shah, mahesh manjrekar ne acha kaam kiya he
 View this post on Instagram # munnabadnaamhua in Chennai today! # dabangg3a post shared bychulbul Pandey (@beingsalmankhan) ondec 16, 2019 at 6:00 am PST actiondabang 3 has a full dose of action but the scenes in many places are unbelievable, unimaginable
 ection main salmaan khan ne south kii filmon ko takkar dene kii bharpoor koshish kii he
 Which is also successful
 film main viefex kaa kaam jabardast he
 The makeup artist has done a great job in making Salman look young
 movie main sabase acchhee cheez he iske gane
 Munna was particularly maligned
 salmaan khan ne malaika ke munni badnaam ko puri takkar di he
 Other songs of the film can also be heard, but there is no song whose tune and lyrics can be seen coming out of the theater humming
 dabang 3 kaa eksre nikaale to film main dekhne laayak koi cheez nahin he
 This is merely an attempt to remove old films and introduce them new
 salmaan khan ke fain ke liye ye film bhale blockbster ho lekin salmaan kii puraani filmon par najar daalen to dabang main wo baat nahin he
 Hence the box office of the film is also expected to be affected
 lakhanu main kashmir ke rahane vaaledukandaaron se marpet ke maamle main deshbhar se pratikriya aa rahi he or log isaki ninda kar rahe hai
 Former judge Markandey Katju has also expressed his displeasure over the incident

 However, with the help of the local people, both the Kashmiri youth were rescued from the clutches of the attackers
 bhagavadhari gundon ne jin do kashmiriyon ko peeta he unamem se ek kaa naam afjal nike he or duusare kaa abdul salaam
 Instead of attacking these poor helpless people why don't you thugs come to me

 dry fruits vikritaon ke saath marpet karne vaale logon ko mobile se kaid kiye gayi video main yah kehete hue suna ja saktaa he ki ve aisa isliye kar rahe hai kyonki ve kashmir se hai
 In the video which is going viral on social media, it can be seen clearly how two attackers are wearing saffron cloth and they are slapping Kashmir vendor with slap and stick

 Jaitley said that in the second year of his tenure, the government will try to speed up the pace of economic reforms
 kar-pranali ke bare main jetali ne bataaya ki ise 'adhik tarksangat' banane ke prayaas kiye jaaenge
 While the government will make full preparations for the implementation of GST (goods and Services Tax) from April 1, 2016 in the field of indirect tax, in the field of direct tax, the rate of corporate tax will be reduced from the current 30 percent to 25 percent in the next four years

 ' bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan vibhaag ne hai court ko'manmohan kaal' kii ek chitthee saunpi he
 It reveals why the UPA government, despite being in power for 10 years, could not accord the status of a protected monument to Jama Masjid
 patr ke mutabik,bataur piemmanmohan singh ne shahi imam ko nijee taur par patr likhakar bharosa diya tha ki mughalakalin masjid ko sangrakshit smarak kaa darja nahin diya jayega
 The High Court has been trying for more than a decade to find out why the Manmohan Singh-led government refused to declare the Jama Masjid a protected monument
 kya likhaa he patr mendilachasp yah he ki manmohan singh ne yah patr 20 oktober 2004 ko likhaa tha
 That is, just after becoming Prime Minister
 piem ne chitthee main likhaa tha ki unhone samskruti mantralay or eesai ko nirdesh de diya he ki ve marammat kaa kaam tay vakt main puraa kar den
 This repair was requested by Imam in a letter dated 10 August 2004
 piem ne unhen letters main yah bhi bataaya tha ki mantralay ne tay kiya he ki jama masjid ko sangrakshit smarak ghoshit nahin kiya jayega
 The ASI filed an answer 15 days ago in the reply court, the ASI said that the issue of granting the status of a protected monument under the central government to the Jama Masjid had come up, but the former prime minister had given credence to the Shahi Imam
 eesai ne apane patr main likhaa he, 'jama masjid sangrakshit smarak nahin he
 Nevertheless, ASI has been doing maintenance work from time to time at its expense since 1956, given its historical importance
 iskaa paisa samskruti mantralay detaa rahaa he na ki shahi imam yaa vakf board
 'significantly, in the last 11 years, several benches of the Delhi High Court have asked for a copy of the file related to the decision not to declare Jama Masjid as a protected monument
 aisa ek nirdesh 27 april 2005 ko court ke tatkaaleen mukhya nyaayadhish justise sanjay kishan kaul kii adhyakshata vaali divijan bench ne diya tha
 The court took these steps in relation to a PIL filed in 2004
 piiel main maang kii gai thi ki athurities ko jama masjid ko sangrakshit smarak ghoshit karne or uske andar or aasapaas se atikaraman hataane kaa nirdesh diya jaae
 In November last year, Suhail Ahmed Khan, in a PIL filed through his lawyer Devinder Pal Singh, challenged the confinement of Shahi Imam's son and demanded a CBI probe into the management of the mosque
 dilli vakf board ke vakil ne kaha tha ki jama masjid vakf kii property he, lekin vah yah sabit nahin kar paae ki masjid kii dekharekh main board ne apane adhikaar kaa koi istemaal kyon nahin kiya he
 In a society where all kinds of misconceptions and taboos about menstruation are found, two women social entrepreneurs from the border village of Jammu and Kashmir have come out in resistance to the taboos associated with this routine biological process
 ve naa sirf jaagrukta failaane main juty hai, balki un garib mahilaon kii madad karne ke liye sainitory napkin banaakar inaki bikri bhi karti hai, jo branded utpaadon ko kharidne main sakasham nahin hai
 Mir Musharraf (18) and Mubina Khan (25) grew up in an orphanage here
 unhone apni udhyamita kii yatra kii shuruyaat do saal pehle kii thi or unhen acchhee tarah se pataa tha ki unhone kis kathin kaam ko chunaa he
 24 Kalamir, who was awarded the Bihar Kala Puraskar, says that we have experienced what women in Kashmir, especially those from the border areas and rural areas, go through during menstruation
 yah keval maahvaaree se judi kalank lagane vaali baton ke bare main nahin he, yah is dauraan swatchta ke bare main bhi he
 Mubina said, it was never going to be easy
 ham ise jaanate the ki kashmir main maahvaaree ke bare main baat karnaa, yahaan tak ki mahilaon ke saath bhi iske bare main baat karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 But, we wanted to defeat this stigma

 This was the period when terrorism in Kashmir was at its peak and Pakistan used to send armed intruders to the Indian border under the cover of firing along the border

 He then admitted his daughter to bassera-e-tabassum, an orphanage in Kupwara, which is run by Pune-based non-governmental organization Borderless World Foundation

 Not only girls were brought up in this orphanage, but they were also taught entrepreneurial skills to become the messengers of socio-economic change in Kupwara
 kupwada ek aisa kshetra hai, jahaan kii kareeb 40 fisadi aabaadi garibi rekha ke neeche he
 Recalling their days in economics, Nobel laureate Richard Annathalaya, who has been a supporter of Modi's demonetisation, describes how she spent hours talking and making plans for what she wanted to do in her life
 mir ne kaha, 'main hameshaa se mahilaon ke liye kuch karnaa chaahati thi, khaastaur se ve jo simavarti ilaakon main rahati hai
 But, i did not even think in my dreams that i would ever be able to talk to women about menstruation in such a way, except for the manufacture of sanitary napkins
 unhone kaha, 'vastav main yah vichaar mubina kaa tha or aap jaanate hai ki kyon? mubina khan hameshaa is baat se pareshaan rahati thim ki mahilaon ke saath maahvaaree ke dauraan kitne bure tareeke se vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 They are not allowed into the kitchen, they cannot pray
 ve un dinon achhut jaisi ho jaati hai
 Mubina said, when our first menstrual period came, our mother gave us some dirty clothes and instructed that it should not be talked about openly
 saath hi parivaar ke baaki sadasyon se dur rahanaa chahie
 He said, 'you can imagine that when we go out to talk openly about this, girls actually whisper about our' shamelessness'
 lekin hamen koi bhi cheez roak nahin sakati
 Meet 20-year-old Shraddha Shashidhar, who will represent India at Miss Universe 2017
the two told about the manufacture of sanitary pads that they would make 250 packs of six pieces every day and each pack would cost Rs 26, while the sanitary napkins found in the market The price is Rs

 He was helped by the Borderless Foundation in this work

 However, the napkins made by them are not as good as the market standards
 iske kaaran unki bikri main giravat aane lagi
 Therefore, to improve this, they need to invest around 9 lakh rupees on expensive machines and for this, they are currently waiting for the investors to stop manufacturing
 mir kahati hai, 'abhi tak koi niveshak saamne nahin aayaa he, lekin jab tak ham ise paa nahin lete, prayaas karte rahenge
 Khan says that we will keep talking about menstruation until everyone breaks open their taboo and starts talking about it openly

 meerut kii sheethal yadav ke jandhan khate main kareeb 100 karod jamaa hone kii baat ko state bank india ne galat bataaya he
 The bank has stated in its clarification that the KYC formalities in Sheetal Yadav's account had not been completed, hence the bank had put a hold on his account
 kevaisi yani 'no yor customer' ke tahat khatadharak ko apni pahchaan se sambandhit jaankariyaan deni hoti hai or aisa na karne par khate par pabandi lagaai ja sakati he
 This restriction of transactions in the account is put on hold in the language of the bank so that no transaction can take place
 bank adhikariyon ne enditivi india ko bataaya ki sheethal ke khate main hold kii raashi xxrep 9 9 lagaai gai thi or uske khate main kareeb 600 rupee hi bakaayaa tha isliye atm se chack karne ke kaaran use bakaayaa negative main dikhaa jise usne apane khate main jamaa raashi maan liya or isi se sari galatfahami paidaa hui
 It is worth noting that Sheetal Yadav, the account holder in the branch of Sharda Road State Bank of India in Meerut, had complained that someone had deposited 100 crore in his Jan Dhan account
 sheethal ke pati ne iske baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ko khat likhaa tha
 Sheetal's husband Jilnadar Singh has said in his complaint to the Prime Minister's Office that he has a Jan Dhan account at SBI branch located at Sharda Road in Meerut
 vah 18 disambar ko jab apane ghar ke paas sthit isiaisiai bank ke atm booth paisa nikaalane gai, lekin yah dekhakar chaunk gai ki unke khate main 99,99,99,394 rupee hai
 He did not believe it and requested a person standing nearby to see the amount deposited in the account, then the person also told the same amount
 iske baad vah nikat sthit yas bank ke atm gai or vahaan bhi vahi raashi khate main jamaa bataai gai
 The comments isaki shikaayat lekar vah lagaataar do din bank gai, lekin bank karmchaariyon ne unki shikaayat hi nahin suni or kaha ki ve kisi aise din aaen jab shakha prabandhak unki shikaayat sun saken

 Bank officials told NDTV India that the amount of hold was placed in Sheetal's account xxrep 9 9 and he had only about 600 rupees in his account, so due to the check from ATM, he showed it in the balance negative which he accepted as the deposit in his account And this led to all the misunderstanding

 The government has accepted his date of birth as May 10, 1950, taking full stop on the controversy over the age of Army Chief General VK Singh for several months and now he has to retire in May next year
 sutron ne bataaya ki raksha mantralay ne atarni general or kanoon mantralay kii raay ke aadhaar par yah nirnay liya he or is faisle se sena pramukh ko guuruuvaar ko avgat kara diya gaya
 The dispute arose after the service records revealed two birth dates of the Chief of Army Staff - May 10, 1950 and May 10, 1951
 jahaan sarvice ricard main matriculation pramaan patr main unki janmatithi 10 may, 1951 he, vahiin sena main pravesh ke liye bhare gaye upiessi ke aavedan patr main unki janm tithi 10 may, 1950 likhi he
 Determining the exact date of birth was very important, as Singh's tenure as army chief would be three years or up to 62 years of age
 ab may, 1950 ko unki janm tithi maanane se unhen agle saal may main sevanivrutt hona hoga, kyonki tab unki umr 62 ho jaaegi
 Singh had argued that May 1951 should be considered his date of birth and he also sought support from three former Chief Justices of the country in this regard
 vivaad ke maddenjar raksha mantralay ne kanoon mantralay or atarni general kii raay maangi, jinhone kaha tha ki 10 may, 1950 ko (sahi) janmatithi mana jaae, kyonki upiessi ke form main yahi janmatithi likhi he
 If there was a discrepancy, it should have been corrected within two years
 ab ummid kii ja rahi he ki singh ke sevanivrutt hone ke baad unka sthaan leftinent general vikram singh lenge jo us samay varishthatam leftinent general honge
 When the dispute started escalating, the Ministry of Defense sought the Attorney General's opinion twice at the same month's interval, and both times he said that the Army Chief's date of birth should be considered May 10, 1950, as those filled for admission to the National Defense Academy It is registered in the form of UPSC
 unki is raay par kanoon mantralay ne bhi apni muhar laga di
 The Attorney General's opinion was different from that which the Army had sought independent and personal opinion from two retired judges - Justice JS Verma and Justice GB Patnaik
 in donon nyaayadhishon ne kathith rup se kaha tha ki 10 may, 1951 ko singh kii janmatithi maani jaae
 Sources said that the Defense Ministry's move to seek feedback from retired judges was not favored by the Ministry of Defense
 darasal jab atarni general ne jab pehali baar kaha tha ki 10 may, 1950 kii tithi main chhedchhad nahin kii ja sakati, kyonki isse gambhir kanoonee vivaad khadey honge
 The Adjutant General Branch of the Army had sought the opinion of the former judges
 pehali raay kanoon mantralay main sanyukt sachiv str ke ek adhikari ne is saal farvari main di thi or kaha tha ki singh kii janmatithi 10 may, 1951 maani jaae

 The path to visit Baba Kedarnath, one of the two Jyotirlingas, is not easy, but even a glimpse of Baba is so virtuous that the devotees just pull away
 kehete hai ki kedarnath ke darshan ke bina badrinaath ke darshan kaa fal nahin miltaa he
 Lord Kedarnath is seen amidst snow-clad peaks
 uttarakhand ke chaar dhaamon main se ek bhagwaan kedarnath, jinke darshan ke liye bhakt puure chah maheene palken bichhaae intjaar karte hai
 Lord Kedarnath sits in the lap of the Himalayan Mountains in Uttarakhand
 kedarnath ke kapaat sirf chah maheene darshan ke liye khulte hai, sardiyon main kapaat shraddhaluon ke liye band kar die jate hai
 During this time, the Lord sits in Ukhimath
 garmiyon ke aate hi bhagwaan ko puure vidhi-vidhaan or dhooma-dham se kedarnath laayaa jaataa he or phir puure bhakthibhaav se unki aradhana kii jaati he
 Kedarnath Bhagwan is coated with butter and butter, so that his wound will be rested
 kehete hai bhagwaan kedarnath pandavon ko bhagwaan darshan nahin dena chaahate the or jab pandavon ne unke jabardastee darshan karne chaahe to bhagwaan kii peeth me ghaav ho gaye
 This is the reason why even today, in Kedarnath, God is worshiped with butter and butter, but the sum of the philosophy of Kedarnath is directly connected with Badrinath
 manyata he ki badrinaath ke darshan kaa punya tab tak nahin miltaa, jab tak bhakt kedarnath ke darshan nahin kar lete
 All kinds of sins are destroyed by the philosophy of nara-narayana-murthy including Kedarnath
 kapaat khulne se pehle bhagwaan bhairavnath kii puja kii jaati he or phir bhagwaan ke dwaar khole jate hai
 It is followed by the worship of Bhukund Bhairava, who is considered the Kshetrapala, but his kapat is closed in winter
 iske peeche yah manyata kaam karti he ki chah maheene tak naarad muni bhagwaan kii akele main aradhana karte hai
 20 km from Rudraprayag via Guptkashi to see the Kedarnath God
 aage gaurikund tak, motormarg se janaa hoga, lekin uske baad 14 kimi
 Will have to travel by foot
 bhagwaan kedarnath kii puri kahaneebhagwan kedarnath saadhe gyaarah hajaar feet kii oonchai par virajte hai
 It is said that Baba came here to hide from the Pandavas, and it was here that the Pandavas got freedom from the sin of total murder
 kedarnath, shiv bhakton kii wo manzil he jiske bina jivan nahin sanvarata, jinke darshan ke liye bhakton kaa man tarasata he, jinka aashirwad paane kii raah main na to himalay kii durgam chotiyaan roda ban paati hai or na hi patharile raste mushkilen paidaa kar pate hai
 The prominent Kedarnath temple among the Panchkadars has a torso appearance of Lord Shiva
 kehete hai dwapar yug main pandavon se bachane ke liye jab mahadev ne bhainse kaa rup dhaaran kiya to unka dhad yaheen gira tha
 This story is related to Dwapara Yuga, this story is related to Pandavas
 kehete hai mahabharat yuddh jeetne ke baad pandavon kulahatya kaa paap dhonaa chaahate the or iske liye wo bhagwaan shiv ke darshan karnaa chaahate the, lekin aughaddani to pandavon se naaraaz the or isiilie wo darshan dekar unhen paap mukt nahin karnaa chaahate the
 Then Shiva took the form of buffalo and hid in Kedar
 pandav bhi jid ke pakke the, unhone bhainsarupi mahadev ko pahchaan liya
 It is said that Bhima also caught Shiva, but in the meantime Lord Shiva had disappeared in the Gutthamagutha, but the devotion and will of the Pandavas melted his heart and he appeared in the torso and appeared to the Pandavas
 bhagwaan ke darshan paakar pandav paap mukt ho gaye
 From that time, Lord Shiva began to be worshiped in Kedarnath as the body of the back
 bhagwaan kedarnath kaa sir nepal main or unki bhujaaen tungnath main, mukh rudranath main, naabhi madmadeshwar main or jataa kalpeshwar main prakat hui
 Therefore, along with these four places, Shri Kedarnath is called Panchkedar, whose worship gives freedom from all sins and troubles
 bhagwaan kedarnath ke kapaat saal main 6 maheene aam bhakton ke liye khulte hai or jo bhi bhakt is dauraan bhagwaan ke darshan kar letaa he use kai janmon kaa punya mil jaataa he

 Aamir Khan's film 'dhoom-3' is scheduled to release this week, but Abhishek Bachchan is angry about the film's promotion
 abhishek kaa kahana he ki 'dhooma-3' unki or udai chopra kii film he
 Abhishek, who is associated with the 'dhoom' series, says that he is the hero of this film and without him and Uday Chopra this film could not have been made
 'dhooma-3' main abhishek or udai ek baar phir se jai dikshit or ali akbar ke apane puraane kirdaar main najar aaenge, jabakiamir khan or katrina cafais film main naakaaratmak bhoomika main honge
 Abhishek said, 'dhoom is my film and i am its hero
 ' koi bhi mujhase vah nahin chin saktaa
 Whether you are big actor or small, 'dhoom' is about Jai and Ali
 agar 'dhooma' main jai or ali nahin honge, to yah film bhi nahin hogi
 There are reports that Abhishek Bachchan is not happy with the promotion of the film, where only Aamir Khan is being shown the face of 'dhoom-3'
 unka kahana he, 'film marketing stratji ke tahat pramot kii ja rahi he
 This is my film and the one where i call me, i come
 kuch event main vah nahin chaahate hai ki main rahun to isamen main kuch nahin kar saktaa
 i don't care about all these things
 main in baton par dhyaan nahin detaa hum
 Abhishek says, "no big name is needed to promote a film like" Dhoom "
 ise aamir, abhishek yaa udai kii jarurat nahin he
 'dhoom' has now become a brand and even if new people come, the film will do a lot
 film ko bahut zyada pramotion kii jarurat nahin he
 ' mumbai main hostel ke kamare main mrit pai gai post graduate medical student doctor paayal tadavi kii postmortem report main uski gardan par nishaan mili hai
 The post-mortem report reveals the scars on his neck under 'provisional cause of death'
 tadavi ke parivaar kii ore se pesh hue vakil nitin satpute ne aarope lagaaya ki chot ke nishaan se pataa chalata he ki tadavi kii hatya kii gai or isliye aropiyon ke khilaaf bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 302 ke tahat maamla darj kiya janaa chahie
 However, the accused's lawyer Abad Ponda argued that the three doctors were not even aware of the caste of Tadvi
 unhone kaha, 'aatmahatya ke liye tab uksaaya jaataa he jab koi jaanboojh kar vyakti ko nuksaan pahunchaana chahta he lekin aropiyon ne (is maamle main) keval unke kaam ke liye unhen danta tha or unako nuksaan pahunchane kii koi manshaa nahin thi
 'advocate Nitin Satpute on behalf of Tadvi's family alleged in the court,' The body of the accused Payal was taken to another place and then brought to the hospital, so there is a suspicion of tampering of evidence
 'aropiyon ke ek vakil kaha ki agar mritka ko koi rasta nahin soojha to unhen naukari chhod deni chahie thi yaa sheersh adhikariyon ke paas shikaayat darj karaani chahie thi, jo ki usne nahin kii
 Citing whatsapp chat, Ponda said that Tadvi had told his mother that nobody in the hospital knows what his caste is? He said that the police is only relying on the complaint of the victim's mother, who did not reveal any specific role of the three accused in relation to the incident
 aropiyon ke ek anya vakil sanjeev bahal ne adaalat ko bataaya ki mritka kii shaadi ek doctor ke saath hui thi lekin uske saath rahane ke bajaae vah hostel main rah rahi thi to ho saktaa he ki kisi paariwarik mudde kii vajah se unhone yah kadam uthaaya ho
 The defense lawyers said that the room where Tadvi was allegedly found hanging was locked from inside, so no one else was likely to be there
 unhone kaha ki aropiyon ke paas tadavi ke kamare tak pahunchane kaa koi jariya nahin tha or police ne darwaja kholaa or shav baraamad kiya
 On Wednesday, all the three accused were produced in a court which sent them to police remand till 31 May
 court ne police kii daleel ko sweekaar kar liya ki bhakthi mehere, hema ahuja or ankitha khandelwal ko hiraasat main lene kii jarurat isliye he taaki yah pataa chal sake ki mritka ne koi suicide note choda tha or agar choda tha to kya aropiyon ne use gum kar diya yaa nasht kar diya
 The police told the court that the mobile phones of the accused have been confiscated but more time is needed to get their whatsapp chat with the victim
 police ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki mehere ko jahaan mangalvaar ko giraftaar kiya gaya vahiin ahuja evam khandelwal ko buudhvaar subah pakadaa gaya
 Akhilesh Yadav, who was on a surprise visit to the state to know the ground reality for the first time after becoming the Chief Minister of the country's largest state-uttar Pradesh in terms of population, had to face the bitter truth in the early days

 Chief Minister Akhilesh made a surprise visit to the Bachhranwa Assembly in Rae Bareli, adjacent to Lucknow on Wednesday, to know the reality of the development works of the villages coming under the Lohia Village Development Scheme launched by the Samajwadi Party government last year

 Although he may have been mentally prepared to face such flaws, but he would not have thought that the level of general knowledge of the children of government schools would have dropped so much

 yah sunakar akhilesh ne sir jhukaa liya
 At the same time, an officer present with the Chief Minister, pointing to Akhilesh, asked the students, who are these? On this, the students replied to Rahul Gandhi
 yah sunakar akhilesh muskuraane lage
 Angered by the level of education in the government school, Akhilesh returned to Lucknow after surprise inspection and directed to shift the basic education officer of Rae Bareli to Gyanendra Pratap Singh Bhadauriya elsewhere due to his indifference towards work and being negligent

 The government also made it clear that only 8 out of the total cases of farmer suicides are registered

 That is, the government has no responsibility for 91 percent of the farmers who commit suicide

 kabir ek vyakti hone ke bajaay vyaktitv hai
 Kabir who is neither Hindu nor Muslim
 kabir jo duniyavi hone ke baavjood jati-dharm se upar hai
 Kabir showing the world a mirror
 samaaj main vyaapt kuritiyon par kutharaghaat karte kabir
 a person who is claimed by both Hindus and Muslims and has risen above all forms of caste
 jab puri duniya ke log moksh ke liye kaashi kii ore jate hai to kabir kaashi chhod kar magahar kii ore chale jate hai
 a person working as a weaver, on whom many people have done their doctorates
 
 So in this sequence, we are giving you a taste from the evergreen couplets of Kabir, who understand the right way to live by listening and every difficulty seems easy
 dukh main sumiran sab kare, sukh main kare na koyajo sukh main sumiran kare, dukh kaahe ko hoyaham sabhi pareshaaniyon membensane ke baadahi ishwar ko yaad karte hai
 Nobody remembers in happiness
 jo yadi sukh main yaad kiya jayega to phir pareshaani kyon aegi
 When i went to see bad people, i did not meet any bad people, i did not get any bad when i went out to see bad and bad people all over the world
 or jo maine khud ke bheetar khojane kii koshish kii to mujhase bura koi nahin mila
 What happened when i grew up, like the tree does not shade the date palm, the fruits are very distant, through this couplet, Kabir wants to say that just being big does nothing
 bada hone ke liye vinamrata jaruri gun he
 Just as the palm tree is so high, neither can it give shade to the wing nor can its fruits be easily broken
 kaal kare so aaj kar, aaj kare so abpal main paralay hoyegi, bahuri karoge kabakal kaa kaam aaj hi khatm karen or aaj kaa kaam abhi hi khatm karen
 It is not that the holocaust will come and everything will be over and you cannot do anything
 aisi bani bolie, man kaa aapa khoipana tan sheethal kare, auran ko sukh hoehameshaa aisi boli ourbhashabolie ki usase aapkaa ahm na bole
 You should also be relaxed and others be happy too
 dhire-dhire re man, dhire sab-kuch hoemali seenche sau gadaa, ritu aae fal hoeduniya main sari chijen apni raftaar se ghatati hai, hadabdaahat se kuch nahin hota
 The gardener irrigates the plant throughout the year and only when the time comes do the fruit grow
 sai itani dijie, ja main kutumb samayemain bhi bhookha na rahun, sadhu na bhookha jaeyaha kabir ishwar se sirf utana hi maangate hai jisamen puraa parivaar kaa kharch chal jaae
 No more and no less
 ki ve bhi bhukhe na rahen or daravaaje par aayaa koi sadhu-sant bhi bhookha na laute
 Just like there is oil in the sesame, as the fire in the flint is in you, if you wake up, it will not be visible after the oil in the sesame and fire in the flint
 thik usee tarahaishwarako khud ke bheetar khojane kii jarurat he
 Searching out will only disappoint
 pothi pard-pard jag muaa, pandit bhayaa na koedhai aakhar prem ke, padhaa so pandit hoekabir kehete hai ki kitaaben pard kar duniya main koi bhi gyani nahin bana he
 Rather, the one who has come to know love is the greatest learned man in the world
 chintaa aisi daakini, kaat kalejaa khaevaid bichaara kya kare, kahaan tak dawa lagaaechintaa rupi chor sabase khatarnaak hota he, jo kaleje main dard uthaata he
 No doctor is prescribed this pain medicine
 maaya mari na man mara, mar-mar gaye sharirasha, trishna naa mari, kah gaye das kabirichhaayen kabhi nahin maratin or dil kabhi nahin bharta, sirf sharir kaa hi ant hota he
 Hope and desire for something is always alive

 The opposition is adamant on the demand for a 2G spectrum and other issues of corruption to be investigated by the Joint Parliamentary Committee, while the government has rejected the demand
 nau november se shuru hue sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main pehle din ko chhodkar hangaame ke kaaran abhi tak donon sadanon main prashnkaal nahin ho paaya he
 At the commencement of the proceedings, Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar expressed condolences on the hardship caused to people due to heavy rains in Tamil Nadu due to the death of about 30 people and displaced in large numbers
 iske saath hi varanasi main mangalvaar ko hue aatanki hamale kii ninda karte hue is chunauti se nipatane kaa sankalp vyakt kiya
 All the present members including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the Lok Sabha also kept silent for a few moments
 iske baad loksabhaa main mira kumaar or rajyasabha main sabhapati hamid ansaari ne jaise hi prashnkaal shuru karne ko kaha, bhaajapa, shivasena, jadyu or annadramuk tathaa sapa, rajd or bijd ke adhiktar sadsy ‘jepisi’ kii maang ko lekar narebaaji karte hue asana ke sameep aa gaye
 In both houses, Congress members came to the front line and started shouting slogans in favor of Public Accounts Committee in place of JPC
 mira kumaar or sabhapati ansaari ne sadasyon se apni seat par baithne or prashnkaal chalane dene kaa aagrah kiya
 But the members kept shouting slogans
 hangaamaa thamate nahin dekh donon ne hi apane apane sadan kii baithak pehle dopaher baarah baje tak ke liye sthagit kar di
 Even after the house resumed at 12 noon, the uproar in both houses of Parliament continued and the presiding speaker in the Lok Sabha, Francisco Sardinha, and the Deputy Speaker in the Rajya Sabha, Rehman Khan, held their House meeting yesterday after putting the necessary documents on the table
