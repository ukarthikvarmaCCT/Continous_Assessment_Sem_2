niryaat karne laayak shikshak taiyaar nahin hote hai tab tak aayaat se hi in khaali padon ko bharaa ja saktaa he
 This list has names of many cities that are not pronounced on TV
 jaise khetadi, jhaadol, kekadi
 There are zero teachers in many subjects of state colleges here
 is suchi se pataa chalata he ki kai collejon main sanskrit ke shikshakon kii padasthapana par khaasaa jor diya gaya he
 After all, Sanskrit will not be insulted, Hindustan type slogans have to be shown before doing anything on the walls
 30 din ke liye sanskrit ke shikshak bheje ja rahe hai
 Even when there were no teachers, i was having fun with Sanskrit, now when i try to complete the course in 30 days, it will be a laughter challenge, not a joke
 aadesh main likhaa he ki aane jane kaa kiraaya diya jayega
 The order regarding 15 days stay, food and drink is not clear
 guest teacher kii sthiti thik nahin he
 This idea of sending for 15-15 days is new because the teacher was sent for the first three months, then the teacher went to court and brought a stay against it
 lagata he isse bachane ke liye 15 din main course puraa karne kaa laughter chalange aayaa he
 Zafar Multani has sent a story from Agar Malwa in Madhya Pradesh to draw attention to a problem of guest teachers
 aap jaanate hai ki madhya pradesh main guest teacher ko atithi vidwaan kaha jaataa he
 According to this, whether the permanent teacher there is considered a scholar or not is not known
 atithi bhi or vidwaan bhi, sunakar lagegaa ki zyaada khatiradaari inhen kii hoti he
 But these are the most exploited
 collejon main shikshakon ko theke par rakhane kii jo shabdaawalee namavali kaa prayog hua he, uskaa sankalan karenge to puri ek kitaab ban jaaegi
 Guest scholar Namita comes to teach at the Government Nehru College here from 70 km away
 namita uniwarsity topper rahi hai
 Namita had Uterus surgery a few days ago
 sarkaar kaa niyam he ki koi bhi atithi vidwaan lagaataar saat dinon kaa avkaash nahin le saktaa he
 If you take more than seven days off, then the work will be freed, ie will be removed
 namita naukari bachaane ke liye surgery kii hilat main bhi safar karti raheen or college aati rahi
 Anyway, the salary you get is spent on the petrol of the car itself
 aap sochie mahila atithi vidwaan ko maa banane par kitni chuttee milti hogi
 When we found out, it was told that the guest scholar does not qualify for maternity leave maternity leave
 aapako shauking nahin laga, angrezi main nahin laga to kya hindi main hairaani nahin hui
 Not only this, it is also important for the guest scholar to go to seminar, present the paper, but the salary is deducted when they go
 permanent teacher jate hai to unka vetan nahin katataa he
 You understand the reasoning behind this
 ab aaiye mumbai uniwarsity
 For the first time in its history, the Vice Chancellor has been dismissed
 itihaas main barkhaastagi se apana naam darz karaane vaale sanjay deshmukh kuch or maamalon main itihaas banaate banaate rah gaye
 RTI activist Anil Galgali has revealed that Sanjay Deshmukh failed the LLB exam in 2015 before becoming a VC
 iske baad bhi ve 774 collejon kii uniwarsity kaa visi banaae gaye
 The Times of India has written that he is close to the RSS
 aresas ko sanjay deshmukh se duuri bana leni chahie kyonki anil galgali ne khulaasa kiya he ki sanjay deshmukh ne apane kaarykaal main ricard videsh yatraaen kii hai
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra said that he broke the 100 million fixed deposit
 yah bhi pataa chal rahaa he ki vaais chancelar sahab vidhyaarthiyon ke paise se hawaii jahaaz kareednaa chaahate the
 The plane
 hamaare vaais chancelaron ne uniwarsity kii uniwarsity barbaad kar di magar ye pehle honge jinhone barbaad karne ke baad hawaii jahaaz kareedne kaa sapana dekha
 If this is true, then before writing a VC one should write that i will ruin the university as soon as possible by running the political agenda of the appointee but will not buy the plane with his money
 is khabar ko bataate hue dil dhadak rahaa he
 Know why it may not have happened, but Sohit Mishra has told that Sanjay Deshmukh has also applied for a private license to fly the ship
 kaash ye khabar galat ho
 They also wanted to fly along with buying airplanes
 ye hua na sachcha visi
 Thought to save the pilot's cost
 agar vipaksh ko fiks karne ke kaam se sibiai, idi
 If the income tax department is free for a few hours, then you should also meet Sanjay Deshmukh
 vipaksh in jaanch agenciyon par yahi aarope lagaataa he ki unheen ke peeche padi hai, kisi or ke nahin
 By the way, the big breaking news is that the proposal to buy aircraft at the university did not pass
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, students demanding a repeat check have changed the field
 ab ve uniwarsity ke maidan se nikal kar azaad maidan aa gaye hai
 Again annoyed with the increase in examination fees
 500 rupee kii fees ko badhaakar 1050 rupee kar die gaye hai
 Think if Sanjay Deshmukh had bought the ship, it would have been amazing
 bachche binar lekar mumbai kii sadakon par daudte rahete or visi samandar ke upar jahaaz udaate hue hansate rahete
 Yahoo continued to do Yahoo
 chaatr to phir bhi pradarshan kar lete hai
 On contract, on contract, part time teaching teachers cannot perform
 nunatam mazaduri se bhi kam par padhaa rahe hai, biimaar hote hai to chuttee nahin mil sakati, bukaar main college ja rahe hai, or aap hamen hansaa hansaa kar maare ja rahe hai ki ham vishwa guru banane vaale hai
 Take a break, i will show another example of the broken system, there can be not only communal politics in India on Krabistan and crematorium, people have proved that they can also scam in this matter
 espie dimd uniwarsity he
 Here too, there are not as many teachers as there should be
 aankade bataate hai ki manzur padon kii tulana main kam shikshak hai or shikshakon kii sankhya kam hi hoti ja rahi he
 In 2014, 32 positions were approved for professors, 29 were professors
 2014 se lekar 2016 tak yah sankhya 29 se kam hokar 23 par pahunch gai
 In 2014, 44 posts of Associate Professor were approved but 30 were working
 2014 main 30 associat professor the or 2016 main 31, yani 13 kii kami he
 There is also a shortage of teachers in the School of Planning and Architects
 ab chalate hai rajasthan
 The system here uses one word, work arrangement
 kaary vyavasthaarth kaa matlab yah hua ki aap college a main padhaate hai or college ba main teacher nahin he to aapako teen maheene ke liye college ba main bhej diya jayega
 But the college a teacher got so upset that he got a stay from the court
 to ab nayaa tarika nikaala gaya he
 Send the lecturer to another college for 15 days
 isi system ko kaary vyavasthaarth kehete hai
 There is also work in it, system is also there, it is also real and it is also meaning sab milakar banate hai kaary vyavasthaarth yani samasya saakshaat
 The Government of Rajasthan has issued the order on 21 October
 aadesh jari karne vaali sanstha kaa naam he ayuktalay college shiksha, rajasthan, jaipur
 The entire chart is made in this order
 bataaya gaya he ki kis college se teacher ko kis college main 15 din ke liye bheja jayega
 According to this order, two teachers will be sent alternately for 15 days in a teacher-less college
 donon par zimmedaari hogi ki 30 dinon ke bheetar paathyakram puraa karne kaa prayaas karenge
 Only after informing the principal will he leave for his native college
 30 dinon main course puraa karne ke liye 279 shikshakon kaa chayan kiya gaya he
 Can two teachers together complete any course in 30 days? Churan is being sold openly to make India a world guru
 ye idia chuuran hi he kyonki 30 din main paathyakram puraa karne ke kamaal kii ummid bharat ke hi shikshakon se hi kii ja sakati he
 From where these teachers will be removed for 15-15 days, then the subject will stop
 isse rajasthan ke ek college main ek saal main course puraa hoga or ek saal main 30 din
 This is an amazing idea
 aap dekh rahe hai ragadrabari, college sarkari or chaatr tarkari
 But on this list, it was known that where there are zero teachers
 chaumahala rajkeey mahavidhyalay main bhugol kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is no Sanskrit teacher in Manoharathana Government College
 manoharthana mahavidhyalay main samajashaastra main bhi koi teacher nahin he
 Khanpur Government College has zero teachers in History, Geography, Sociology
 samasya kaa samaadhaan yahi hoga ki shikshakon kii sthaayee niyukti kii jaae
 Till exportable teachers are not ready, then these vacant positions can be filled only by import
 is suchi main kai shaharon ke naam hai jinka uccharan tivi par nahin hota he
 Such as Khetri, Jhadoul, Kekri
 yahaan ke rajkeey collejon ke kai vishyon main zero teacher hai
 This list shows that there is a lot of emphasis on the posting of Sanskrit teachers in many colleges
 akhir sanskrit kaa apmaan, nahin sahegaa hindustan tip naare deevaaron par likhane se pehle kuch to karke dikhaanaa hi hoga
 Sanskrit teachers are being sent for 30 days
 jab teacher nahin the tab bhi sanskrit ke saath mazaaq ho rahaa tha, ab jah 30 din main course puraa karaane kaa prayaas karenge to yah mazaaq nahin, laughter chalange hoga
 It is written in the order that the fare to be paid will be paid
 15 din thaharne, khaane pine ke bare main aadesh spasht nahin he
 The status of guest teacher is not good
 15-15 dinon ke liye bheje jane kaa yah idia nayaa he kyonki pehle teen teen maheene ke liye shikshak bheje jate the to iske khilaaf shikshak court chale gaye or ste le aae
 To avoid this, a laughter challenge has come to complete the course in 15 days
 jafar multani ne madhya pradesh ke agar malwa se guest shikshakon kii ek samasya kii taraf dhyaan khinchne ke liye story bheji he
 You know that the guest teacher in Madhya Pradesh is called a guest scholar
 is hisaab se vahaan ke permanent teacher ko vidwaan samajha jaataa he yaa nahin, pataa nahin
 The guest as well as the scholar, will hear that they are more interested
 magar sabase zyaada shoshan inhen kaa hota he
 If you compile the terminology nomenclature used to hire teachers in colleges, then the entire book will be made
 yahaan ke shaskeey nehru mahavidhyalay main atithi vidwaan namita 70 kimi dur se padhaane aati he
 Namita has been a university topper
 kuch dinon pehle namita kaa utaras kii surgery hui thi
 The government rules that no guest scholar can take seven consecutive days off
 saat dinon se zyaada avkaash legaa to kaary mukt kar diya jayega yani hataa diya jayega
 Namita also traveled to surgery to save her job and kept coming to college
 vaise bhi jo selary milti he wo car ke petrol par hi karch ho jaati he
 Think about how much leave a female guest scholar will get when she becomes a mother
 hamane pataa kiya to bataaya gaya ki atithi vidwaan ko matternity live maatrutiv avkaash kii paatrata nahin he
 You did not feel fond of, did not engage in English, then it was not surprising in Hindi
 yahi nahin atithi vidwaan ke liye bhi zaruri he ki ve seminar main jaaen, paper pragent karen magar jab ve jate hai to vetan cat jaataa he
 When a permanent teacher goes, his salary is not deducted
 aapako iske peeche kaa tark samaj aayaa
 Now come to Mumbai University
 iske itihaas main pehali baar vaais chancelar ko barkhaast kiya gaya he
 Sanjay Deshmukh, who has got his name recorded in history, kept making history in some other cases
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ne yah khulaasa kiya he ki sanjay deshmukh visi banane se pehle 2015 main elelbi kii pariksha main fail ho gaye the
 Even after this, he was made the VC of the University of 774 colleges
 times of india ne likhaa he ki ve aresas ke kareebi hai
 The RSS should distance itself from Sanjay Deshmukh as Anil Galgali has revealed that Sanjay Deshmukh has made record overseas trips during his tenure
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne bataaya ki unhone 100 karod kii fiks dipazit tod di
 It is also being learned that the Vice Chancellor had wanted to buy the plane with the money of the students
 hawaii jahaaz
 Our Vice Chancellors ruined the university but they will be the first who dreamed of buying a plane after the ruin
 agar yah sahi he to visi banane se pehle likhva lenaa chahie ki main niyukt karne vaale ke raajnneetik agenda ko chalaate hue uniwarsity ko jald se jald barbaad kar duungaa magar uske paise se hawaii jahaaz nahin kharidoongaa
 Heart beats telling this news
 jane kyon lag rahaa he ki aisa nahin hua hoga magar sohit mishra ne bataaya he ki sanjay deshmukh ne jahaaz udaane hetu privet license ke liye applai bhi kiya
 i wish this news was wrong
 hawaii jahaaz kareedne ke saath ye udaana bhi chaahate the
 This is not true VC payalat kaa karcha bachaane kii sochi
 If the CBI, ED, by the work of fixing the opposition
 iskar vibhaag kuch ghante ke liye free ho to sanjay deshmukh se bhi mil aana chahie
 The opposition accuses these investigative agencies that they are behind them, not anyone else
 vaise big braking news yahi he ki vishvavidhyalay main aircraft kareedne kaa prastaav paas nahin hua
 The comments is bich dobaaraa kapi check karaane kii maang karne vaale chaatro ne maidan badal diya he
 Now they have come out of university grounds to Azad Maidan
 dobaaraa pariksha kii fees vruddhi se naaraaz hai
 The fee of Rs 500 has been increased to Rs 1050
 sochie sanjay deshmukh ne jahaaz kareed liya hota to gazab ho jaataa
 Children would run on the streets of Mumbai carrying banners and laughing while flying ships over VC sea
 yahuu yahuu karte rahe
 Students still perform
 sanvida par, theke par, anshkalik padhaane vaale teacher to pradarshan bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 We are teaching less than the minimum wage, we cannot get leave if we are ill, we are going to college in Bukhar, and you are killing us by making us laugh that we are going to become world gurus
 brake le lijie broken system kaa ek or namoona dikhaaungaa, bharat main krabian or shmashaan ko lekar sirf sampradayik raajnneeti hi nahin ho sakati he, logon ne sabit kar diya he ki ve is maamle main ghotaalaa bhi kar sakate hai

 This is not true VC payalat kaa karcha bachaane kii sochi
 If the CBI, ED, by the work of fixing the opposition

 The opposition accuses these investigative agencies that they are behind them, not anyone else
 vaise big braking news yahi he ki vishvavidhyalay main aircraft kareedne kaa prastaav paas nahin hua
 The comments is bich dobaaraa kapi check karaane kii maang karne vaale chaatro ne maidan badal diya he
 Now they have come out of university grounds to Azad Maidan

 The fee of Rs 500 has been increased to Rs 1050
 sochie sanjay deshmukh ne jahaaz kareed liya hota to gazab ho jaataa
 Children would run on the streets of Mumbai carrying banners and laughing while flying ships over VC sea
 yahuu yahuu karte rahe
 Students still perform
 sanvida par, theke par, anshkalik padhaane vaale teacher to pradarshan bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 We are teaching less than the minimum wage, we cannot get leave if we are ill, we are going to college in Bukhar, and you are killing us by making us laugh that we are going to become world gurus
 brake le lijie broken system kaa ek or namoona dikhaaungaa, bharat main krabian or shmashaan ko lekar sirf sampradayik raajnneeti hi nahin ho sakati he, logon ne sabit kar diya he ki ve is maamle main ghotaalaa bhi kar sakate hai
 279 teachers have been selected to complete the course in 30 days
 kya do teacher milakar 30 din main kisi bhi paathyakram ko puraa kar sakate he? bharat ko vishwa guru banane kaa chuuran khuleam bechaa ja rahaa he
 This idea is the only one because it can be expected from the teachers of India that it is amazing to complete the course in 30 days
 jahaan se ye teacher 15-15 din ke liye hataae jaaenge vahaan to vishay tham jayega
 This will complete the course in one year in a college in Rajasthan and 30 days in a year
 kamaal kaa idia he na
 You are watching Ragdarbari, college government and students
 lekin is suchi yah to pataa chal gaya ki kahaan kahaan zero teacher hai
 There is no teacher of Geography in Chaumhala Government College
 manoharthana rajkeey mahavidhyalay main sanskrit kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is also no teacher in Sociology at Manorathana College
 khanpur rajkeey mahavidhyalay main itihaas, bhugol, samajashaastra main zero teacher hai
 The solution to the problem will be to make permanent appointment of teachers
 niryaat karne laayak shikshak taiyaar nahin hote hai tab tak aayaat se hi in khaali padon ko bharaa ja saktaa he
 This list has names of many cities that are not pronounced on TV
 jaise khetadi, jhaadol, kekadi
 There are zero teachers in many subjects of state colleges here
 is suchi se pataa chalata he ki kai collejon main sanskrit ke shikshakon kii padasthapana par khaasaa jor diya gaya he
 After all, Sanskrit will not be insulted, Hindustan type slogans have to be shown before doing anything on the walls
 30 din ke liye sanskrit ke shikshak bheje ja rahe hai
 Even when there were no teachers, i was having fun with Sanskrit, now when i try to complete the course in 30 days, it will be a laughter challenge, not a joke
 aadesh main likhaa he ki aane jane kaa kiraaya diya jayega
 The order regarding 15 days stay, food and drink is not clear
 guest teacher kii sthiti thik nahin he
 This idea of sending for 15-15 days is new because the teacher was sent for the first three months, then the teacher went to court and brought a stay against it
 lagata he isse bachane ke liye 15 din main course puraa karne kaa laughter chalange aayaa he
 Zafar Multani has sent a story from Agar Malwa in Madhya Pradesh to draw attention to a problem of guest teachers
 aap jaanate hai ki madhya pradesh main guest teacher ko atithi vidwaan kaha jaataa he
 According to this, whether the permanent teacher there is considered a scholar or not is not known
 atithi bhi or vidwaan bhi, sunakar lagegaa ki zyaada khatiradaari inhen kii hoti he
 But these are the most exploited
 collejon main shikshakon ko theke par rakhane kii jo shabdaawalee namavali kaa prayog hua he, uskaa sankalan karenge to puri ek kitaab ban jaaegi
 Guest scholar Namita comes to teach at the Government Nehru College here from 70 km away
 namita uniwarsity topper rahi hai
 Namita had Uterus surgery a few days ago
 sarkaar kaa niyam he ki koi bhi atithi vidwaan lagaataar saat dinon kaa avkaash nahin le saktaa he
 If you take more than seven days off, then the work will be freed, ie will be removed
 namita naukari bachaane ke liye surgery kii hilat main bhi safar karti raheen or college aati rahi
 Anyway, the salary you get is spent on the petrol of the car itself
 aap sochie mahila atithi vidwaan ko maa banane par kitni chuttee milti hogi
 When we found out, it was told that the guest scholar does not qualify for maternity leave maternity leave
 aapako shauking nahin laga, angrezi main nahin laga to kya hindi main hairaani nahin hui
 Not only this, it is also important for the guest scholar to go to seminar, present the paper, but the salary is deducted when they go
 permanent teacher jate hai to unka vetan nahin katataa he
 You understand the reasoning behind this
 ab aaiye mumbai uniwarsity
 For the first time in its history, the Vice Chancellor has been dismissed
 itihaas main barkhaastagi se apana naam darz karaane vaale sanjay deshmukh kuch or maamalon main itihaas banaate banaate rah gaye
 RTI activist Anil Galgali has revealed that Sanjay Deshmukh failed the LLB exam in 2015 before becoming a VC
 iske baad bhi ve 774 collejon kii uniwarsity kaa visi banaae gaye
 The Times of India has written that he is close to the RSS
 aresas ko sanjay deshmukh se duuri bana leni chahie kyonki anil galgali ne khulaasa kiya he ki sanjay deshmukh ne apane kaarykaal main ricard videsh yatraaen kii hai
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra said that he broke the 100 million fixed deposit
 yah bhi pataa chal rahaa he ki vaais chancelar sahab vidhyaarthiyon ke paise se hawaii jahaaz kareednaa chaahate the
 The plane
 hamaare vaais chancelaron ne uniwarsity kii uniwarsity barbaad kar di magar ye pehle honge jinhone barbaad karne ke baad hawaii jahaaz kareedne kaa sapana dekha
 If this is true, then before writing a VC one should write that i will ruin the university as soon as possible by running the political agenda of the appointee but will not buy the plane with his money
 is khabar ko bataate hue dil dhadak rahaa he
 Know why it may not have happened, but Sohit Mishra has told that Sanjay Deshmukh has also applied for a private license to fly the ship
 kaash ye khabar galat ho
 They also wanted to fly along with buying airplanes
 ye hua na sachcha visi
 Thought to save the pilot's cost
 agar vipaksh ko fiks karne ke kaam se sibiai, idi
 If the income tax department is free for a few hours, then you should also meet Sanjay Deshmukh
 vipaksh in jaanch agenciyon par yahi aarope lagaataa he ki unheen ke peeche padi hai, kisi or ke nahin
 By the way, the big breaking news is that the proposal to buy aircraft at the university did not pass
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, students demanding a repeat check have changed the field
 ab ve uniwarsity ke maidan se nikal kar azaad maidan aa gaye hai
 Again annoyed with the increase in examination fees
 500 rupee kii fees ko badhaakar 1050 rupee kar die gaye hai
 Think if Sanjay Deshmukh had bought the ship, it would have been amazing
 bachche binar lekar mumbai kii sadakon par daudte rahete or visi samandar ke upar jahaaz udaate hue hansate rahete
 Yahoo continued to do Yahoo
 chaatr to phir bhi pradarshan kar lete hai
 On contract, on contract, part time teaching teachers cannot perform
 nunatam mazaduri se bhi kam par padhaa rahe hai, biimaar hote hai to chuttee nahin mil sakati, bukaar main college ja rahe hai, or aap hamen hansaa hansaa kar maare ja rahe hai ki ham vishwa guru banane vaale hai
 Take a break, i will show another example of the broken system, there can be not only communal politics in India on Krabistan and crematorium, people have proved that they can also scam in this matter
 chaumahala rajkeey mahavidhyalay main bhugol kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is no Sanskrit teacher in Manoharathana Government College
 manoharthana mahavidhyalay main samajashaastra main bhi koi teacher nahin he
 Khanpur Government College has zero teachers in History, Geography, Sociology
 samasya kaa samaadhaan yahi hoga ki shikshakon kii sthaayee niyukti kii jaae
 Till exportable teachers are not ready, then these vacant positions can be filled only by import
 is suchi main kai shaharon ke naam hai jinka uccharan tivi par nahin hota he
 Such as Khetri, Jhadoul, Kekri
 yahaan ke rajkeey collejon ke kai vishyon main zero teacher hai
 This list shows that there is a lot of emphasis on the posting of Sanskrit teachers in many colleges
 akhir sanskrit kaa apmaan, nahin sahegaa hindustan tip naare deevaaron par likhane se pehle kuch to karke dikhaanaa hi hoga
 Sanskrit teachers are being sent for 30 days
 jab teacher nahin the tab bhi sanskrit ke saath mazaaq ho rahaa tha, ab jah 30 din main course puraa karaane kaa prayaas karenge to yah mazaaq nahin, laughter chalange hoga
 It is written in the order that the fare to be paid will be paid
 15 din thaharne, khaane pine ke bare main aadesh spasht nahin he
 The status of guest teacher is not good
 15-15 dinon ke liye bheje jane kaa yah idia nayaa he kyonki pehle teen teen maheene ke liye shikshak bheje jate the to iske khilaaf shikshak court chale gaye or ste le aae
 To avoid this, a laughter challenge has come to complete the course in 15 days
 jafar multani ne madhya pradesh ke agar malwa se guest shikshakon kii ek samasya kii taraf dhyaan khinchne ke liye story bheji he
 You know that the guest teacher in Madhya Pradesh is called a guest scholar
 is hisaab se vahaan ke permanent teacher ko vidwaan samajha jaataa he yaa nahin, pataa nahin
 The guest as well as the scholar, will hear that they are more interested
 magar sabase zyaada shoshan inhen kaa hota he
 If you compile the terminology nomenclature used to hire teachers in colleges, then the entire book will be made
 yahaan ke shaskeey nehru mahavidhyalay main atithi vidwaan namita 70 kimi dur se padhaane aati he
 Namita has been a university topper
 kuch dinon pehle namita kaa utaras kii surgery hui thi
 The government rules that no guest scholar can take seven consecutive days off
 saat dinon se zyaada avkaash legaa to kaary mukt kar diya jayega yani hataa diya jayega
 Namita also traveled to surgery to save her job and kept coming to college
 vaise bhi jo selary milti he wo car ke petrol par hi karch ho jaati he
 Think about how much leave a female guest scholar will get when she becomes a mother
 hamane pataa kiya to bataaya gaya ki atithi vidwaan ko matternity live maatrutiv avkaash kii paatrata nahin he
 You did not feel fond of, did not engage in English, then it was not surprising in Hindi
 yahi nahin atithi vidwaan ke liye bhi zaruri he ki ve seminar main jaaen, paper pragent karen magar jab ve jate hai to vetan cat jaataa he
 When a permanent teacher goes, his salary is not deducted
 aapako iske peeche kaa tark samaj aayaa
 Now come to Mumbai University
 iske itihaas main pehali baar vaais chancelar ko barkhaast kiya gaya he
 Sanjay Deshmukh, who has got his name recorded in history, kept making history in some other cases
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ne yah khulaasa kiya he ki sanjay deshmukh visi banane se pehle 2015 main elelbi kii pariksha main fail ho gaye the
 Even after this, he was made the VC of the University of 774 colleges
 times of india ne likhaa he ki ve aresas ke kareebi hai
 The RSS should distance itself from Sanjay Deshmukh as Anil Galgali has revealed that Sanjay Deshmukh has made record overseas trips during his tenure
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne bataaya ki unhone 100 karod kii fiks dipazit tod di
 It is also being learned that the Vice Chancellor had wanted to buy the plane with the money of the students

 Hi
 
 
 main raveesh kumaar
 After the incident of 16 December in Delhi, thousands of boys and girls descended around Raisina Hills, there was a lot of debate on what is the status of girls in the thinking of the city and society
 is soch ko chunauti di gai ki balaatkaar ko izzat ke luute jane se nahin jodna chahie
 It has been said that this makes the victim guilty, while the victim is a rapist
 iskaa samaaj par gaharaa asar hua
 Due to fear of society, rape victims started going to the police station and testifying in the courts
 pichley dinon hindu akhbaar ne ek report bhi chhaapi ki dilli main adaalaton or vakeelon ke ravaiye main bhi badlaav aayaa he
 Rape cases are being filed
 izzat kaa chalaa janaa usee soch kaa hissaa he, jiske naam par ham ladakiyon par tarah tarah kii paabandiyaan lagaate hai
 His freedom governs what kind of clothes he wore, how long he stayed outside the house, etc
 ladakiyon ke sharir par tarah-tarah kii saamaajik sansthaaen parampara or samskruti ke naam par daavedaari karti hai, control karti hai
 If these things are understood then now we come to love jihad
 kerala se yah maamla chaar paanch saal pehle chalaa tha phir dakshin karnataka pahunchaa, vahaan se upi or jharkhand aa gaya he
 Bypassing delhi-mumbai
 vaise itihaas main yah masalaa saazish theory ke tahat pichley sau- dedh sau saal se uthaaya jaataa rahaa he
 In different forms that the population of Muslims will increase and Hindus will decrease
 janaganana ke aankade aise kisi trade kii taraf ishaara nahin karte hai
 See a report of Prashant Jha in Hindu newspaper dated 13 September 2013
 is report main prashanth meerut zile ke vishwa hindu parishad ke netaa chandra mohan sharma se baat kar rahe hai, jo bataa rahe hai ki lav jihad ek nai technic he
 Muslim youth who are first seen as beautiful are identified
 unka naam sonu, raju jaisaa rakhaa jaataa he
 These boys are given jeans t-shirts, mobiles and bikes and are taught to behave well and then stand outside the school college and trap Hindu girls
 jeens tii shart mobile or bike jaise do-chaar itamon se las sonu, raju or rocky naam vaale na jane kitne skulon or coffee shop ke chakkar kaat kar barbaad ho chuke hote hai
 Their parents will also let them go happily to leave girls in the name of Islam and trap girls of Hindus
 sabase pehle to kathith rup se un muslim yuvaaon kii tasviir saarvajanik karne par vichaar kiya janaa chahie taaki duniya bhi dekhe ki unki khubsuurati ke kaaran ek rajya main yaa to danga ho jaataa he yaa hote-hote batch jaataa he
 But is the same thing said when a Hindu boy and girl give heart to each other
 1925 ke saal main le chalate hai aapako jab ek shaks ne min kamff likhaa
 Germany is ashamed to this day that someone like it was born in their country
 hitler naam he iskaa
 Hitler writes in Mein Kampf that the dark-haired Jewish young men implicate naive German girls
 yahudiyon ke saath ashwet yuva bhi chupchaap yahi karte hai or hamaari nasl ko nasht kar dete hai
 Hitler said all this to incite hatred towards the Jews
 baaki sab itihaas he
 Currently, Germany has the lowest birth rate in Europe
 2011 se 13 ke bich 11 pratishat kii kami ai he
 It is not just Hitler to say that this has happened because of the Jews, but in UP, Dharm Jagran Manch insisted that by August 17, one million Hindus would tie a Rakhi on their wrist to make a Hindu girl get seduced by a Muslim boy i will not let you come
 meerut main jab khabar ai ki madrase ke ek shikshak ne ek hindu ladki ke saath dharmaparivartan kiya, khaasaa raajnneetik bavaal ho gaya
 Later this news came out wrong
 phir thode dinon baad ranchi se ek khabar ai kii tara sahadev naam kii ek shooter ke saath ek muslim yuva ne dhokhaa diya
 According to the latest information, the police have said that the boy has not been converted
 usne nikaah kiya he, namaaz padhata he magar ek yaa do baar masjid gaya he
 Such people will be found everywhere who cheat girls
 magar yah kahana ki sangathit rup se jhansa diya ja rahaa he iskaa koi thos pramaan to hona hi chahie
 There will also be people who start reading Gita as Muslims and start reading Quran through Hinduism
 kya jaanch ke puri hone se pehle sirf ladki yaa kisi ladke ke bayaan par ranchi jaise shahar ko band kar dena paripakv raajnneeti he
 Is it appropriate to change the question of justice of the girl in your politics? hamaare sahyogi shrinivasana jain ne meerut ke ek gaanv main dekha ki viechpi ke sthaneey netaa ladakiyon ko cheta rahe hai ki lav jehad se bachein
 But these leaders were not telling these girls that in the last year, the highest number of rape cases in UP have come from Meerut
 meerut main sabase adhik dahej pratadna ke 423 maamle darj hue
 1,119 women were abducted
 zaahir he balaatkaari dahej ke naam par hinsa karne vaala yaa agava karne vaala kai hindu bhi honge
 Will we now distribute criminals on the basis of Hindu Muslims? ye aankaden yahi to bataa rahe hai ki upi kii ladakiyon ko khatra mardon se hai, na ki hindu yaa muslim mardon se
 See also the national statistics of sex ratio and feticide
 aap garbh main betiyon ko maarane vaale hindu pitaaon ke bare main kya sochenge

 Mangold said, "this technology will work not only in gadgets with sensors but also in toys and gadgets that have leds
" elidi ke jariye khilaunon or gajet ko aasaani se conect kiya ja saktaa hai
 Data from one bulb to another will travel through binary code
 aasaan shabdon main agar kahen to yah takanic ghar main lage wifai router jaise hi kaam karegi
 As the two laptops are connected through the router, the bulbs will also connect to each other and gadgets through VLC technology

 But it is definitely that special sockets will be designed for these bulbs

 chamaki bukhaar par bahes se nitish kumaar ne ishaaron-ishaaron main bhaajapa ko saaf kar diya ki agar aapke paas media he to mere saath bhi bihar kaa puraa vipaksh he
 There was a debate on Chamchi fever in Bihar Legislative Assembly on Monday
 yah bahes kai kaarnon se yaadgaar rahegi
 Decision in the history of Bihar Legislative Assembly was accepted by the opposition's adjournment motion after decade and the party and opposition will certainly give credit to the Speaker of Bihar Legislative Assembly Vijay Chaudhary
 lekin jo bahes hui usase kai baaten saafe huin
 1
 is bahes kaa ek sabase bada sandesh yahi tha ki bihar main bhale mukhyamantri nitish kumaar apane munh se media ke ek tabake ke kilaaf nahin bol rahe hon lekin bahes ke dauraan vipaksh ke netaaon ke bhaashan se saafe tha ki media ke is varg ne kiske ishaare par nitish kumaar ke kilaaf amaryadit or asansadeey bhashaa kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Everyone is well aware of this and at least he rose above the party line on this issue and appeared with Nitish Kumar
 jo bihar ke sansadeey itihaas main ek mukhyamantri ke liye aisi vipaksh ko bhaavana aaj tak nahin dikhi thi
 2
 bhaajapa ke netaaon ko bhi bahes ke tevar se is baat kaa andaaz ho gaya ki vipaksh main rahake jo satta paksh ke liye paimaana unhone banaaya tha ab jab ve satta main baithe hai vipaksh unheen ke purv kaa yaad dilaakar istifa kii maang kar rahaa he
 3
 is bahes se saafe tha ki filhal nitish kumaar kii sthiti ek phool do mali vaali he ki bihar main har dal kii pehali pasand loksabhaa chunaav ke parinaam ke baad ab vahi he kyonki ye galatafahami ab har dal ke netaa or vidhayak ke maan se chali gai he ki nitish kumaar ke bina satta main aayaa ja saktaa he or nitish kumaar kaa saath ho to satta se dur koi kar saktaa he
 4
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar jo kareeb chaar hafte ke baad bacchon kii maut par saarvajanik rup se bol rahe the unki baton se saafe tha ki is baar bacchon kii maut kaa sabase bada kaaran garibi, kuposhan or tab garmi jaisi taatkaalik kaaran the
 5
 prashasnic vifaltaa bhi, swasthya mantri mangal pandey kaa bayaan ho yaa nitish kumaar kaa, unki baton se saafe tha ki jo jaagrukta abhiyaan chalaaya janaa chahie tha wo chunaav ke chakkar main is baar shithil pad gaya tha
 6
 sabase zyaada chaunkaane vaala aankada tha khud swasthya mantri mangal pandeya dwaara pesh kiya gaya jiske anusaar is beemaari se 2011 se ab tak 1663 logon kii maut hui he
 7
 haalanki bahes ke dauraan kisi vidhayak ne yah sawaal nahin uthaaya ki jab mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or up mukhyamantri susheel modi aspataal or isiu kaa daura kar rahe the tab kya us aspataal main akhir ek bhi mask nahin tha
 And the slipper he was given was also brought that morning for the first time due to a VVIP tour
 8
 Although during this debate, Health Minister Mangal Pandey gave details of every day but he remained silent on one thing that when the number of sick children was flooding every day, then the decision to increase the number of doctors and nurses also stopped till Nitish Kumar's visit Stayed
 9
 This debate will also be remembered for the fact that when the debate was going on on such a sensitive issue, Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav kept sitting at his house but did not think the need to come to the assembly
 10
 But despite the whole debate, it was not decided who was responsible for the death of the children
 sabase rochak rahaa up mukhyamantri susheel modi kaa twit jisamen unhone saafe kiya ki chunki lalu-rabadi ne apane shashan kaal main kabhi bhi naitik zimmedaari nahin lee isliye mangal pandeya bhi istifa nahin denge
 In the 37th match of the IPL, two big teams of South India will be face to face once again
 bangalore kii team form main dikh rahi he jabaki chennai pichley dinon haar kaa saamana karke apane pradarshan par thodi maayoos jarur hui hogi
 It will be interesting if Virat's army will be able to trouble Dhoni's team? ipel sizan 8 main duusari baar chennai or bangalore kii team aamane-saamne hogi
 In the last match in Bengaluru, MS Dhoni's team defeated Virat Kohli's army by 27 runs
 ipel ke har sizan kii tarah is sizan bhi chennai kaafii majboot dikhaai de rahi he, lekin pichley kuch maichon se team ko jeet naseeb nahin hui he
 When Robin Uthappa snatched a win against Chennai against Kolkata, David Warner beat Chennai bowlers heavily in a match with Hyderabad
 tippaniyan The strength of Chennai has been its big batsmen, who have been failing to perform well for the last two matches
 pichley teen maichon main brendan maikkalam ne 19, 32 or 12 ran banaae hai, jabaki unke jodidar dwen smith ne 25, 0 or 21 ran banaae hai
 Suresh Raina, the highest run-scorer in the IPL, has scored 17, 8 and 23 runs in the last three matches
 aisa lagata he ki team kii gendbaazi bhi patari se utar gai he
 Ashish Nehra, Mohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja, seen in rhythm, are also seen colorless now
 duusari taraf royal chalanger bangalore kii gaadi patari par laut rahi he
 After the loss to Chennai, the team has not yet seen the defeat
 is dauraan team dilli, kolkata or rajasthan ko do baar haraa chuki he
 One match was inconclusive due to rain
 gendbaazi main team ke paas michel stark, varun aron, yajuvendra chahal form main hai to ballebaazi main kris gail, abi divilliars ke saath khud viraat kohli maujuud he
 If Bangalore showed confidence in Sarfaraz Khan, this player also did not give a chance to disappoint his captain
 sarafaraaj ne rajasthan ke kilaaf naabad 45 ran kii pari khel kar sabko prabhavit kiya he
 Mandeep Singh also played an important role in helping his team win against Kolkata by showing charisma with the bat
 form main lauti viraat kii sena agar chennai jaisi team par jeet darj karti he, to zaahir he ki isse team kaa manobal jarur badhegaa

 In bowling, the team has Mitchell Starc, Varun Aaron, Yajuvendra Chahal in form, while Chris Gayle, AB de Villiers, along with Virat Kohli are present in the batting
 bangalore ne sarfaraaj khan par bharosa dikhaaya to is khilaadi ne bhi apane captain ko niraash karne kaa mauka nahin diya
 Sarfaraz has impressed everyone by playing an unbeaten 45-run innings against Rajasthan
 mandeep singh ne bhi balle se karishma dikhaa kar kolkata ke kilaaf apni team ko jeet dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 If Virat's army returns to form and wins on a team like Chennai, it is obvious that it will definitely boost the morale of the team
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle arunachal ke purv mukhyamantri or bhartiya janata party (BJP) ke varisht netaa gegong apang ne party se istipha de diya
 On Tuesday, he accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of not following the principles of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 gegong apang ne bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ko bheje apane istife main kaha, 'main yah dekhakar niraash hum ki bhartiya janata party ab atal bihari vaajapeyi ke siddhaton par nahin chal rahi

 yah ek netaa kii mutthi main he, jo vikendrikaran yaa loktantric nirnay prakriya se nafrat karata he or un mulyon ko nahin maanata, jinke liye party kii sthapana hui thi
 Former Arunachal Chief Minister Apang said that the BJP did not get the mandate in 2014 in Arunachal Pradesh, but the BJP leadership made Kalikho Pul the Chief Minister of Arunachal by buying and doing every dirty trick
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki supreme court ke pratikul faisle ke baavjood bijepi ne arunachal pradesh main sarkaar banaai
 Apang claimed that no proper investigation was conducted into the suicide of Kalikho Pul nor the BJP leadership took any care of morality during the formation of several other BJP governments in the Northeast
 unhone kaha ki 10-11 november ko pasighat main hui rajyastareey kaaryakarini kii baithak ke dauraan bijepi mahasachiv ram madhav ne kai sadasyon or padaadhikariyon ko apane vichaar tak nahin rakhane die
 "the decision to make Pema Khandu the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh before the election is neither in line with that tradition nor in the tradition that a party with a cadre like BJP follows," news agency IANS quoted Apang
 ' aapako bataa den ki saal 2014 main arunachal main hue vidhansabha chunaav main nabam tuki ke netritv main congress ne baari bahumat ke saath satta main vaapasi kii thi
 a year after the Congress formed the government in the state, 21 of the 47 Congress mlas revolted against Tuki
 iske chalate rajyapal ne nabam tuki sarkaar ko barkhaast kar diya or soobe main raashtrapati shashan lag gaya
 Within a month of the imposition of President's rule in Arunachal Pradesh, the Governor administered the oath of office to the Congress rebel faction leader Kalikho Pul on February 19
 kalikho pul ko bijepi ke 11 vidhayakon kaa bhi samarthan mila
 The Congress challenged this in the Supreme Court
 sheersh court ne 13 july ko rajyapal ke faisle ko asanvaidhanik qaraar diya or nabam tuki ke netritv vaali sarkaar ko behaal kar diya tha
 After this, in the Congress Legislature Party meeting on 16 July, Pema Khandu was elected as the Leader of the Legislature Party in place of Nabam Tuki
 pema khandu ko 44 vidhayakon kaa samarthan mila or wo 17 july, 2016 ko arunachal pradesh ke mukhyamantri ban gaye

 Meanwhile, Speaker Birla warned Eden and Pratapan, who are waving big posters, not to do so
 sadasyon ke nahin maanane par spikar ne marshalon ko donon congress sadasyon ko sadan se baahar karne kaa aadesh diya

 happiness alwaysa post shared by Malaika Arora Khan (@malaikaarorakhanofficial) on Aug 4, 2016 at 12:36 am PDT mumbai main sthit mantralay main 13 waiter ke liye nikali bhartee ke liye kareeb 7 hazaar logon ne form bharaa he jisamen badi taadaad main graduate or post graduate chaatr bhi shaamil hai
 Unemployment in the state can be estimated from this case
 vipaksh jahaan is par sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish karte dikhaai de rahaa he to vahiin sarkaar kaa ab bhi yahi kahana he ki pichhali sarkaar kii tulana main berojgaare main kami ai he
 The recruitment of 13 waiters came out in the Ministry of Mumbai, for which the educational qualification was required to pass class IV
 
 
 lekin in padon ke liye kareeb saat hajaar logon ne form bhare hai jisamen se zyadatar log graduate or post graduate hai
 According to the opposition, this is an example of unemployment spreading in the state
 haalanki sarkaar kaa ab bhi maananaa he ki pichhali sarkaar kii tulana main is sarkaar ke dor main berojgaare kam hui he
 The government may be patting itself on its back, but the figures from the state's labor department make a different story

 ' According to Makhjumi, he was very scared and the employee was talking to him like 'I am an animal
 ' phir epabiai ke teen agent makhjumi ko poochtacha ke liye le gaye
 He told her that the Arabic-speaking worker was angry because of his anti-muslim bias

 rajasthan congress karyaalay main mukhyamantri ashok gahalot se jab yah poocha gaya ki aakhir gurjar andolan ke liye sarkaar kii kya ranneeti he to gahalot ne apane paas baithe sachin payalat kii taraf ishaara karte hue mike payalat ke taraf paas khiskaa diya
 After this, all the people laughed together
 phir rajasthan congress ke pradesh adhyaksh or rajasthan sarkaar main upmukhyamantri sachin payalat ne ashok gahalot se poocha ki main kyon duun, aap kyon nahin
 Then asked the journalists standing in front of whom you are questioning, questioning the government or questioning the Congress party, seeing the situation deteriorating, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that no, you say, you too the government Be part uske baad payalat bole
 Pilot said, but with a sudden thrown googly of Ashok Gehlot, he looked completely shaken and intermittently said that we are fully committed to 5 percent reservation of Gujjars
 samarpit hai, jo bhi is main kanoonee aadchan aa rahi he use jald se jald dur kiya jayega
 Also, the Modi government at the center should take initiative for reservation of Gujjars in the same way as it has taken initiative for 10 percent reservation
 yah kahkar sachin payalat or ashok gahalot uth gaye, lekin charchaaon kaa daur garm ho gaya
 Has Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot made Sachin Pilot a Gurjar leader? Even when the tug of war for the Chief Minister was going on, it was being said from the Gehlot faction that Sachin Pilot is a Gurjar and only Gurjars are supporting him
 sachin payalat ke liye sabase badi duvidha yah he ki vah lagaataar is koshish main lage rahete hai unki pahchaan ek rajasthan ke jananetaa ke rup main ho naa ki gurjar netaa ke rup main ho 
 Today, once again, Sachin Pilot Gurjar became the leader in front of everyone

 ' desh main 'aap' ke badhate prabhaav se kathith rup se chintit bhaajapa ne arvind kejariwal kii party ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki yah kuleen logon kii party he na ki aam aadmi kii
 Shahnawaz dismissed the claims of AAP becoming a threat to the BJP and said, "people are increasingly losing faith in AAP
" uske prati janata kii soch dinon nahin balki ghanton ke hisaab se badal rahi he
 ' congress or aap ke bich santhganth kaa aarope lagaate hue unhone kaha ki chunaav se pehle kejariwal kehete rahe the ki vah bhrashtachar ke aaropon main shila dikshit ko hathkadi lagavaayenge, lekin swany mukhyamantri banane ke baad se vah is bare main chuppi saadhe hue hai

 ' On the news of AAP fielding candidates for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, a BJP spokesperson satirized, "why are they not contesting all the Lok Sabha seats, have they left 150 seats for Congress?" dakshin africa team aakhirkaar hai-voltage match main team india se haar hi gai, african team ke bare main match se pehle jitani badi-badi baaten kahi gayi thi african team vaise hi kheli or vaise hi bade antar se haari bhi
 The opponents in front of the African team were big, the target was big, the match was big and the challenge was only their performance was small
 dakshin africa team ke wicket aise gir rahe the jaise videshi bazaar main kachche tel ke daam, pichley do maichon ke baad to mujhe lagane laga he team india bhi pradhanmantri ke ‘naseeb’ ke chalate jeet rahi he
 On such an occasion, he explains the five reasons why the South African team lost
 
 1-what did not happen for the anti-sharma teams? Ishant Sharma was not playing the World Cup, Rohit Sharma's absence in this match proved to be the deadliest thing for the South African team, after his early dismissal, Dhawan made the match
 Took too much serially
 2-majaak pasand nahin ayaham bharatiyon kaa cens of humar bahut kamjor he, majaak samaj bhi nahin pate or sah bhi nahin pate yahaan ham AIB kii baat to kar hi nahin rahe hai
 In the first video of this match, two children dressed in South Africa made fun of Team India for never winning the World Cup from Africa, then what happened is in history
 3-dhawan par tha sasuraal main kuch kar dikhaane kaa dawababanda sabakuch sah saktaa he sasuraal waalon ke saamne beijjati nahin, yahi hua dhawan ke saath, dhawan kii sasuraal australia main hi he or is maukey par dhawan ne sasuraal waalon ke saamne sho-of karne kaa koi mauka nahin choda, yahaan tak ki shatak ke baad bhi wo aise ran bana rahe the maano ranjai kaa match ho or iske pradarshan ke hisaab se rashtriya team main salection hona he
 4-south Africans were in a hurry to chase the score of 307 runs
 The players of South Africa were in such a hurry as if they were eager to listen to the coming minds of the evening, Hashim Amla and de Kock, Stan and Markel were like this
 Went away by throwing wickets, Mulayam Singh Yadav's grandson was angry at not being called in Tilak
 kuch khilaadi to yun hi out ho gaye taaki bhartiya darshakon ko baar-baar tivi par ubaau vigyaapan jhelane paden
 5-no green jerseys India was the first green jerseys Pakistanis of South Africa, defeated today, seeing green jerseys in front of them, they were having a feeling of neighbors, news that Pakistanis were also praying for the victory of South Africa
 The situation in Pakistan is such that if he asks for blessings for any fish, then it gets cold
 pakistan ne duaen maangi or asar kuch yun hua ki dakshin africa kii team haar gai, dafrica team kii haar kii sabase badi vajah yahi bataai ja rahi he
 The irregular lifestyle of the mother can lead to obesity in children
 yahaan tak ki garbh dhaaran karne se pehle kii maa kii jeevanstyli bhi bacchon ke vajan va shaareerik banaavat ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 The impact of the mother's lifestyle can be seen on the child in her later life too
sian Robinson, lead researcher britain main uniwarsity of southampton ke mukhya shodhakarta siyaan robinson ne kaha, 'hamaare nateezon ke mutabik, motaape ko rokane kii koshish shuruyaat se hi kerani chahie, yahaan tak ki garbhaadhan se pehle hi
 It is important to keep proper weight and not to smoke at that time
 ' is adhyayan ke mutabik, shodhakartaaon ne bacchon main motaape ke liye jimmedaar paanch karkon par dhyaan kendrit kiya, jinamein ek maheene se bhi kam samay ke liye stanpan ke saath-saath maa se jude chaar anya kaarak hai
 "cyan said," Obesity during pregnancy, excessive weight gain, smoking and vitamin d deficiency can also cause child obesity
 chaar saal kii umr ke aise bachche, jo in karkon main se chaar yaa paanch se kisi rup main prabhavit rahe hai, unamem motaape kaa khatra aise bacchon kii tulana main adhik dekha gaya, jo in karkon se kisi rup main prabhavit nahin rahe
 In this study, this risk was found to be higher in children at the age of six years
 aise bacchon main motaape kaa khatra 4
 65 times more
 yah mahatvapurn he ki bacchon main motaape ke khatre ko unke khanpan yaa shaareerik gatividhiyon se jodakar nahin dekha gaya
 The study concluded after a study of 991 children

 According to Amitabh Thakur's wife, Nutan Thakur, after Azam's buffalo theft and seizure, Amitabh had said on some channels that the minister's immediate recovery of buffalo has led to a lot of hope, but it is a matter of concern that it was stolen in 2011 After registering an FIR for his child's bicycle and Rs 5,000 cheated on him in 2013, the police of Gomtinagar police station have not even questioned him
 nutan thakur kaa kahana he ki unke pati ne ek sahi baat bhar kahi thi or unhen notice mil gaya
 The Director General of Police has asked Thakur's statement to reply in seven days, criticizing the rule and violating Rules 7 and 17 of the All India Services Conduct Rules

 Chhattisgarh Board of Secondary Education has seen a large number of rigging cases in the board exams of 10th and 12th
 shikshakon ne bagaiyr uttar pustika dekhe chaatro ko apane man se ank de die
 Actually, the teachers blindly evaluated the copies in order to earn more money
 in shikshakon ne jitani zyada kapiyaan janchi, utani adhik unki kamai ho gayi, lekin duusari ore hajaaron bacchon kaa bhavishya daanv par lag gaya
 Alam has been that if someone gets a good number on average after solving a good form, then someone gets good marks written on anything
 jo bachche fail hue yaa phir unhone punarmoolyankan karaayaa, to unhen us vishay main 50 se zyada ank praapt hue
 These children and their families have pointed fingers at the State Board of Secondary Education
 madhyamik shiksha mandal ne apane ko ghirta hua dekh 295 shikshakon ko blike listed karte diya he
 Also, these teachers have been excluded from the evaluation work for three years
 75 or 100 ankon vaale vishyon main 50 ank kaa badhanaa behad myne rakhata he
 Before taking action on these teachers, the Board of Secondary Education examined the answer books two to three times with different teachers
 iske baad mukhya pariksha moolyankan main laaparvaahee baratane vaale shikshakon ke khilaaf kaarywahi kaa faisla liya gaya, lekin ab sawaal yah he ki in chaatro kaa kya hoga, jinhone ausat ank hasil karne ke baad bhi punarmoolyankan ke liye aavedan nahin kiya? kya madhyamik shiksha mandal un chaatro ko bonus ank degaa yaa phir unki kaapiyon ke bhi punarmoolyankan kii sifarish karegaa, taaki nae anko ke saath unki nai marksheet jari ho
 Now hundreds of students and their parents have pleaded for justice after the negligence of teachers
 jin vishyon main laaparvaahee barti gayi, unamem ganit, vigyaan, angreji, saamaajik vigyaan or sanskrit jaise vishay shaamil hai
 After passing the 10th board, they get admission in special courses only on the basis of marks earned by the students while enrolling in 11th
 aisa hi un chaatro ke saath hota he, jo 12veen kii pariksha paas karne ke baad college main daakhila lete hai
 In this way, 10th and 12th reading and marks list determines the future of the students
 philhal maamle ke tool pakadaney ke saath hi chhattisgarh madhyamik shiksha mandal ne wo blike listed shikshakon kii vetan vruddhi rokane kii sifarish bhi karegaa

 But the party has not indicated any change in its attitude towards Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 jad (you) ne shanivaar ko yah bhi saaf kiya ki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar pradhanmantri pad kii hode main nahin hai
 There was speculation in the political aisle that with JD (U) opposing Modi as the prime ministerial candidate, the JD (U) could pressurize him to be elected as the prime ministerial candidate at the earliest
 is bich, bhaajapa ne kaha he ki jad (you) ke saath sabhi matbhed sulajhaa liye jaaenge
 In its national executive meeting on Saturday, the JD (U) indicated that it would not put immediate pressure on the BJP to announce the prime ministerial candidate for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 jad (you) kii baithak shuru hone ke kuch hi ghante baad party pravaktaa kasee tyaagi ne patrakaron se kaha ki unki party bhaajapa ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karne ke liye kuch samay de sakati he
 Asked if his party would give the BJP time to declare the prime ministerial candidate, Tyagi said, "the BJP is our friend and there is no need to adopt a bargaining or pressure strategy with the ally
 " However, the party's attitude towards Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi was also angry on Saturday
 modi ko dharmanirpeksh netaa ke rup main maane jane ke sawaal par jad (you) ke pravaktaa kasee tyaagi ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, "gujarat ke mukhiya ke rup main narendra modi 2002 ke dangon se nipatane main asafal sabit hue
 " jad (you) ke anya netaa shivanand tiwari ne kaha ki party kii baithak main modi ke ummidavaar chune jane kii sambhaavna par vichaar-vimarsh nahin kiya gaya
 Tiwari said in question, "why will Modi be discussed?" udhar, bhaajapa adhyaksh rajnath singh ne shanivaar ko kaha ki donon dalon ke bich jo bhi mudde honge, unhen sulajhaa liya jayega
 Rajnath said these things in relation to the differences that JD (U) has made about the alliance candidate for the next Lok Sabha election
 ullekhneey he ki bhaajapa ke andar gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko gathbandhan kii taraf se pradhanmantri pad kaa pratyaashee ghoshit kiye jane kii joardaar maang uthi he, jiskaa jad (you) lambey samay se virodh kar rahaa he
 According to sources, there were secret talks between senior BJP and JD (U) leaders
 sutron ne bataaya ki rajnath ne jad (you) adhyaksh sharad yadav or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke saath is mudde par baatcheet kii
 JD-U leader Nitish Kumar has on several occasions lodged a serious objection to Modi being made the prime ministerial candidate
 tyaagi ne bataaya ki party apana raajnneetik prastaav bhi taiyaar kar rahi he, jise ravivaar ko prastut kiya jayega
 The JD (U) National Executive meeting started in Delhi on Saturday and the party's national conference will be held on Sunday
 party sutron ne bataaya ki baithak main vartmaan rajaniki paridrishy or aarthik evam videsh niti par prastaav laayaa jayega
 The comments party saansthanik muddon evam chunavi chunautiyon par bhi charchaa karegi, jiske antargat paanch rajyon main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav tathaa 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav par vichaar-vimarsh kiya jayega
 It is noteworthy that JD (U) is the largest constituent of NDA after BJP
 jad (you) ke loksabhaa main 20 saansad hai
 JD (U) also made it clear on Saturday that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is not in the race for the post of Prime Minister
 raajnneetik galiyare main atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim ki pradhanmantri ummidavaar ke rup main modi kaa virodh karne ke saath hi jad (you) jald se jald pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar chune jane ke liye dabaav bana saktaa he
 Meanwhile, BJP has said that all differences with JD (U) will be resolved
 shanivaar ko apni rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main jad (you) ne sanket diya ki vah 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee kii ghoshnaa ko lekar bhaajapa par tatkaal dabaav nahin banaaegi
 Hours after the JD (U) meeting began, party spokesperson KC Tyagi told reporters that his party could give the BJP some time to declare the prime ministerial candidate
 yah poochne par ki kya unki party bhaajapa ko pradhanmantri pad kaa pratyaashee ghoshit karne ke liye samay degi, tyaagi ne kaha, "bhaajapa hamaari dost he or sahyogi ke saath saudebaaji yaa dabaav kii ranneeti apnaane kii jarurat nahin hoti
 " gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko lekar party kaa tevar haalanki shanivaar ko bhi barkaar rahaa
 On the question of Modi being regarded as a secular leader, JD (U) spokesperson KC Tyagi said in a press conference, "narendra Modi as the head of Gujarat has failed to deal with the 2002 riots
 " Another JD (U) leader Shivanand Tiwari said that the possibility of Modi being elected as a candidate was not discussed in the party meeting
 tiwari ne sawalia lahaze main kaha, "modi par charchaa kyon kii jaaegi?" On the other hand, BJP President Rajnath Singh said on Saturday that any issues between the two parties will be resolved
 rajnath ne ye baaten jad (you) dwaara agle loksabhaa chunaav ke liye gathbandhan ke pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee ko lekar ubhare matbhed ke sambandh main kahi
 It is noteworthy that there has been a strong demand within the BJP to declare Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate from the coalition, which JD (U) has been opposing for a long time
 sutron ke anusaar, bhaajapa tathaa jad (you) ke varisht netaaon ke bich gupt baatcheet hui
 Sources said Rajnath held talks with JD (U) president Sharad Yadav and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on the issue
 jad-you netaa nitish kumaar kai maukon par modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa pratyaashee banaae jane par gambhir aapatti darj kara chuke hai
 Tyagi said that the party is also preparing its political proposal, which will be presented on Sunday
 jad (you) kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak shanivaar ko dilli main shuru hui tathaa ravivaar ko party kaa rashtriya sammelan hoga

 Parcha wrote, "if one pursues all the three incidents related to Kasab's life in a systematic manner, then he will see a path connected to the madness of Islamic fundamentalism which leads to disintegration of the country and society

 aam aadmi party main siyaasi tufaan laane vaale kapil mishra ab bhi apane rukh par kaayam hai
 In an exclusive conversation with Aaj Tak, Mishra not only reiterated his allegations but also made it clear that he was going to complain to the anti-corruption Bureau
 mishra ne baar-baar kaha ki unki baat par bharosa tab hoga jab satyendra jain jail jaaenge lekin arvind kejariwal ko jail bhejne kii baat kehane se wo bachate rahe
 Mishrakapil Mishra, who will complain to ACB, said that he will inform the anti-corruption Bureau about the alleged transaction between Satyendar Jain and Arvind Kejriwal
 mishra ke mutabik wo is silsile main somvaar ko 11 baje beuro jane vaale hai
 He said that he is not only ready to be a witness in this case
 ye paanch sawaal to kapil mishra se bhi poochna jaruri he? clic kar padhein-tanker ghotaale par daalaa pardaakapil mishra ne daawa kiya ki unhone 2 saal pehle tanker ghotaale kii report arvind kejariwal ko saunpi thi
 But the government did not take any action
 mishra kii maane to kejariwal ke salaahkaaron ashish talwaar or vibhav patel ne mukhyamantri ko is maamle main karrwai karne se roka
 Repeated allegations: While Mishra claimed that he is the only immaculate minister in Kejriwal's cabinet, on the other hand, Kejriwal and Satyendra Mishra repeated the serious allegations
 mishra ke mutabik unhone party ke bheetar punjab chunaav kii funding or satyendra jain ke kathith bhrashtachar ko lekar bhi sugabugahat suni he lekin unhone in kayaason ko gambhirtha se nahin liya kyonki wo kejariwal ko eemaandaar netaa maanate the
 Mishra claimed that at his behest, Kejriwal resigned from the daughter of Satyendar Jain
 unhone daawa kiya ki asibi se milane kaa vakt maangane ke baad hi kejariwal ne unhen mantripad se hataaya
 According to Mishra, Kejriwal told him after taking money from Satyendra Jain that many things happen in politics
 vishwaas se nahin shikawamishra kaa kahana tha ki unke aaropon par kumaar vishwaas ke rukh se unhen hairaani nahin hui
 According to Mishra, if Kumar Vishwas were to support him, people would have considered his allegations a political conspiracy
 unhone mana ki aaj party ke zyaadaatar netaa unki baat par yakeen nahin kar rahe hai lekin jis din satyendra jain jail jaaenge us din log unki baat ko jarur maanenge
 First Iraq and now Syria
 abu al-bagdadi ke ladaakon ne
 
 in donon deshon main katleam machaaya hua he
 Baghdadi has now issued a new decree for journalists working in their occupied cities
 saath hi usne ye taakid bhi kii he ki agar kisi ne uske is farmaan kii nafarmani kii, to uskaa sir kalam kar diya jayega
 For this, he has also issued a guideline
 iesas ne syria or iraq main kaam karne vaale sabhi patrakaron ke liye ek farmaan jari kiya he
 This decree states that now every journalist working in the occupied cities and areas of ISIS in both these countries will have to work with him and under his supervision and if any journalist does not accept his decree then it will be done
 Will have to suffer
 aapako bataa den ki iesas pehle hi america ke do patrakaron james folli or steven sotlauf ke sir kalam kar unke video jari kar chukaa he
 At the same time, his British fighters have another John Journalin, and they have threatened to kill him too
 darasal iesas kii taraf se jari is farmaan main kaha gaya he ki agar kisi patrkaar ko syria or iraq main chal rahi ladaai par koi bhi khabar kerani he to use iske liye pehle iesas ke media cell se ijaajat leni padegi
 Not only this, ISIS has also released some guidelines for journalists in this new decree
 masalan
 The first guideline: All journalists must promise to support Abu al-baghdadi
 duusari guidelinew jo bhi kaam karenge us par iesas ke media afasar nazar rakhenge
 Third Guideline journalists can work directly with all international news agencies but cannot work with any international and local satellite TV channels
 chauthi guidelinebhi patrakaron ko iesas ke blaclist kiye hue tivi channelon jaise al-arabia or al jazira ke saath kaam karne se manaa kiya gaya he
 Fifth Guideline Not only this, every news and photo printed in newspapers will be printed along with the photo of the journalist and photographer who wrote it
 chhathi guidelinepatrkaar iesas ke media cell kii anumati ke bagaiyr koi bhi khabar naa to prakashit karvaa paaenge or naa hi use cover kar paaenge
 Seventh guideline journalists can keep their social media account but they have to tell ISIS about this account and page
 aathvin guidelinebhi patrakaron ko iesas ke kabze vaale shaharon or ilaakon main kisi bhi photo ko khinchate vakt in niyamon kaa paalan karnaa hoga
 The media officers of the Ninth guidelineisis will monitor the work of all journalists and if anyone indulges in obeying their decree, it will be considered guilty for this mistake
 dasvin guidelineiess ke mutabik uski jari kii ye sabhi guideline final nahin he or kisi bhi vakt inamen zaruri tabdili kii ja sakati he
 All journalists must obtain a license from the media office of ISIS to make reporting in the cities and areas occupied by the eleventh guideline ISIS
 uske baad hi wo reporting kar paaenge
 By the way, after the assassination of James Foley and Steven Sautloff, most international journalists working in Syria and Iraq have left ISIS occupied cities and local journalists from these countries are currently working there instead

 haalanki apane pehle hi chunaav main abbaas ko maat mili thi
 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national general secretary Swami Prasad Maurya's alleged objectionable statement on Hinduism has led to controversy
 haalanki party pramukh mayawati ne ise unke 'vyaktigat vichaar' bataate dete hue isse kinaaraa kar liya he
 On the other hand, BJP has demanded action against Maurya in this case
 gauratlab he ki uttar pradesh vidhansabha main netaa vipaksh swami prasad maury ne ravivaar ko lakhanu main karpuri thakur bhagidaari mahasammelan main daliton se apil kii thi ki ve shaadi-byaah main gauri-ganesh kii puja na karen
 He had said that this is a trick to mislead Dalits and backward in the Manuvadi system and enslave them from the ruler
 itnaa hi nahin maury ne kaha, 'manuaadi log suar ko varah bhagwaan kahkar sammaan de sakate hai
 One can worship the donkey as Bhavani, the owl as Lakshmi and the rat as Ganesha's ride, but cannot honor the Shudra
 maury ke bayaan ko bispi se na joda jaae: mayis bayaan par pratikriya dete hue bispi supremeo mayawati ne kaha ki party baba sahab bhimrao ambedkar dwaara nirmit samvidhan ke dharm-nirpekshata ke mul siddhanth ke anurup sabhi dharmo, sarvasamaj ke logon ke rahan-sahan, shaadi-vivaah, puja-paath or unki samskruti ke taur tareekon kaa aadar karti he
 He said that what BSP leader Swami Prasad Maurya said during a program on Sunday in Lucknow about worship and worship is his personal opinion and reaction and should not be associated with BSP
 mayawati ne kaha ki bispi daliton, pichhadon, agadi jatiyon or dharmik alpsankhyak samaaj ke logon ko saath lekar samtamulak samaaj vyavastha sthapit karnaa chaahati he
 BSP is full of hatred for the upper castes: BJP Meanwhile, bjp's provincial spokesperson Vijay Bahadur Pathak expressed strong objection to Maurya's statement, saying that due to desperation of defeat, BSP leaders are now trying to mutilate social systems
 unhone kaha ki matadaataaon par dhili hoti pakad ne bispi netaaon ko ek baar phir agadi jatiyon ke prati nafrat or vaimnasy ke raste par jane ko majaboor kar diya he
 Pathak said that without the will of the BSP chief, not a single leaf would move in the party
 mayawati khud kahati hai ki unki party ke netaa khud unka likhaa bayaan hi padhate hai
 In such a situation, bsp's thinking is exposed by Maurya's statement
 unhone kaha ki yah agar vah vaaki maury kaa nijee bayaan he to mayawati ko unke khilaaf karrwai kerani chahie

 gandhi vikalpaheen hai yaa yun kahen ki gandhi kaa vikalp hi nahin he
 This was stated by Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha Harivansh in a seminar called 'gandhi Kal Aaj and Kal' in Varanasi
 yah sangoshtee purv pradhanmantri chandrashekhar kii 12 veen punyatithi par varanasi ke kaashi viapeeth ke gandhi adhyayan sabhaagaar main hui
 Recalling Chandrasekhar, Harivansh said that Chandrasekhar was the carrier of the politics of that generation which was completely inundated with Gandhi's ideas
 chandrashekhar ne kisi bhi paristhiti main apane vichaaron se samjhauta nahin kiya or kai baar to akele hi galat baat par sabake saamne date rahe
 Despite being the Prime Minister, he stood by his views for the benefit of the country
 isliye kaha gaya ki ve asuvidhajanak safal pradhanmantri the
 Despite all the contradictions, he used to do politics of consent
 harivansh ne jor dekar kaha ki aaj vishwa jis sankat se guzar rahaa he uskaa samaadhaan kisi or ke paas nahin balki gandhi ke paas hi maujuud he
 There are many shortcomings in the economic model based on consumerism, whose remedy is found in the Gandhian economy
 unhone kaha ki aaj puri duniya main paryaavaran ke sangrakshan ko lekar gambhir charchaa ho rahi he
 Today, there are seven billion people on Earth, while its natural resources are only to meet the needs of two billion people
 sansadhano kaa jabardast dohan hamaare sabhi natural bhandaaran ko khatm kar degaa
 Gandhiji has said that nature meets everyone's needs but we should pay attention to it
 lekin afsos ham iskaa lagaataar andhadhundh dohan kar rahe hai
 Hence Gandhi is also relevant here
 aaj puri duniya gandhi ke in vichaaron ko pard rahi he or us par amal bhi shuru kar diya he
 Harivansh said that the European model of development is not appropriate for India, that Gandhiji had said to Nehru when the country was independent and Nehru had a tendency towards European model
 saafe he ki gandhi kal or aaj jitne praasangik the utane hi ve aane vaale kal main bhi rahenge

 He has a stab in his hand and later beats James's head unarmed and hand tied
 ab dekhnaa he ki america kya kadam uthaata he

 mulaayamane kaha ki purv raksha mantri ke taur par vah jaanate hai ki bharat kii sena pakistan ke kisi bhi dussahas kaa karaara jawaab dene ke liye sakasham or kaabil he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav, who usually talks about a good relationship with Pakistan, is now changed and believes that Pakistan will have to respond in the language it understands
 yahi nahin mulaayam singh yadav to ek kadam aage badhkar ab yah bhi kah rahe hai ki bharat kopakistanke kabje vaale kashmir ko waapas lene kaa prayaas karnaa chahie or agar sarkaar aisa koi kadam uthaati he to vah puri tarah se iskaa samarthan karenge
 Mulayam Singh was also invited to attend the all-party meeting to be held in Pakistan on Thursday on Thursday but Mulayam Singh Yadav could not participate in it due to being in Lucknow
 lekin unhone apni manshaa spasht kar di or kaha is maamle par sarkaar jo koi bhi kadam uthaati he unki party sarkaar kaa majbootee se saath degi

 The situation is worse than before, because now not only army posts are targeted but also common citizens
 lekin in sab ke bich ek kavayad rishton main sudhaar kii bhi he or ol time fevorett cricket ko iskaa jariya banaaya ja rahaa he
 Obviously, the india-pakistan cricket series amidst the furore on the border is a question in itself, but the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board and former foreign secretary Shaharyar Khan say the two are separate issues
 unka kahana he ki ab vah vakt aa gaya he, jab aage badha janaa chahie or cricket donon deshon ke bich ahm bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 There is continuous ceasefire violation from Pakistan

 Apart from this, big players like Rahul Dravid of India, Anil Kumble and former players like Javed Miandad from Pakistan can prove to be good ambassadors for cricket diplomacy

 Whatever happens there, it affects India
 ’’ unase poocha gaya tha ki bharat pakistan kii sthiti ko kis rup main dekhtaa he kyonki vahaan lagbhag prati din aatankwaadi hamale ho rahe hai
 The Finance Minister said, "if terrorism is bad for India, it is equally bad for Pakistan
 agar aatankwaad se bharat peedit hota he to pakistan bhi isse peedit hota he
 Mukherjee was the foreign minister in the first term of the UPA government

 Mukherjee said, "when we say that terrorism will not be tolerated at all, we mean that terrorism will not be tolerated at all in every part of the world
 tab ham aisa nahin kehete ki koi ek desh aatankwaad kaa shikaar hoga or doosraa desh iskaa shikaar nahin hoga
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was addressing the top commanders of the three defense services on Tuesday, also seemed to indicate Pakistan's position

 '' vishwacap 1983 main bharat ko khitaabi jeet dilaane vaale kapil ne kaha tha,‘jab maine pehali baar bumraah ko dekha to kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki vah apane khel ko itane aage tak lekar jaaenge

 The Indian hockey team could not win even after coming close to winning for a long time
 jeet jaise uski hatheliyon main aakar phisal-phisal jaati
 He was consistently playing well

 But this time not only he has been the winner of Asia Champion Trophy but he has won this cup by defeating Pakistan in the final
 bhartiya hockey team ke captain pi aar srijesh ne yah jeet uri aatanki hamale main shahid javaanon ko samarpit kii he
 Significantly, Sreejesh is the captain of the Indian hockey team as well as the goalkeeper
 aisa kam hi dekha jaataa he ki koi golkeeper bhi team kaa captain bhi ho
 Forwards and midfielders are seen more as captains
 aise main ek aam insaan or chaatr hockey ke captain se kya-kya sikh saktaa he
 1
 team ke saath saamanjasy bithaana
 
 
 It is possible that your choice and language is outside the entire team
 iske baavjood aap team ke sadasyon se saamanjasy bithaane kii koshish karen
 Sreejesh himself belongs to the state of Kerala
 jaahir he ki team mechadhikansh khiladipunjab, haryana or hindi bhashi pradeshon main hai
 In such a situation, it will be a big challenge to take everyone along
 2
 No work is small
 
 
 hockey jaise field game main golkeeper kii bhoomika chaahe kitni bhi mahatvapurn kyon na ho magar unhen hameshaa hi doum darje kaa mana jaataa he
 Despite this, they did not give up
 aaj bharat kii ismahatvapurn jitamen unke yogadan ko kahin se bhi kamatar nahin aanka ja saktaa
 3
 desh ko hameshaa aage rakhana
 
 
 Sreejesh believes that the role of the country behind what they are today is very important
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi ki yah jeet bhi unhone uri aatanki hamale main shahid sainikon ko samarpit kii he
 4
 apane kaam se kaam rakhana
 
 
 Hockey team captain Sreejesh is well aware that success is achieved only after being focused on one thing
 ve khel se pehle soshalmedia jaiseabhashi madhyamonse bhi duuri banaae rakhte hai
 After all, such success is not available in this way
 5
 Neither happy in victory nor disappointed in defeat
 
 
 srijesh is baat se bakhubi avgat hai ki kai baar aap acha khilne ke baavjood jeet nahin pate
 The need of the hour is to play consistently well and keep yourself restrained
 ve apni team ko bhi aisa karne ke liye hameshaa prerit karte rahete hai

 That is, the share price has increased almost three times
 lekin sawaal he ki aakhir kyon company ke share main recordtod badhat dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Let's understand the whole matter

 media khabaron ke mutabik raahat package ko lekar sarkaar ne cabinet sachiv kii adhyakshata main sachivon kii ek samiti gathit kii thi
 This committee has prepared a complete draft of the relief package
 iske alaava 1 disambar se tarriff plan badhaane kaa elaan karne ke baad bhi company ke share record majboot hue
 It is anticipated that the increase in tariff will support the loss making revenue and operating income of vodafone-idea

 yah rifund 2004- 05 ke baad hui tex assesament kaa he
 In some cases of the company, the High Court and the Appellate Tribunal have decided in its favor and now she is insisting on the Income Tax Department to give her the refund as soon as possible
 rifund milanaa aasaan nahinhaalanki iskar vibhaag bakaayaa lautaane ko lekar pashopesh main he
 In fact, under the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR), a new liability of Rs 44,150 crore has been revealed on Vodafone Idea
 yahi vajah he ki iskar vibhaag rifund lautaane se pehle soch rahaa he
 The Income Tax Department believes that in this case the Ministry of Finance should consult the Telecom Ministry and take a decision on the refund
 yahaan bataa den ki agiaar telecom companiyon se liya jane vaala ujes or licencig fees hota he

 PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan has clarified that long-time Test team captain misbah-ul-haq will continue to be the captain of the national Test team if he continues to play international cricket
 42 saal se upar ke ho chuke misbah kaa balla ab bol rahaa he or unhone pichley dinon pakistan cricket lig main fifty banaakar ise sahi bhi sabit kiya tha, jabaki vah international level par tii-20 cricket nahin khelte hai

 Shaharyar, however, indicated that if Misbah decides to retire, the board can make a captain in all three formats
 unhone kaha, ‘agar misbah uplabdh nahin rahata he to ham sabhi praroopon main ek captain ko praathamikta denge
 Shaharyar's statement indicated that wicketkeeper batsman Sarfraz Ahmed could also be appointed as the captain of the Test team as he is already the captain of the T20 and ODI teams

 *** pehle chunaav main nirdal ne hasil kii thi jitinelo kaa ummidavaar paala badal bijepi menharyana kii ek seat in dinon charchaa main he
 The reason for discussion is the change of party before voting of a candidate
 vah seat hamehendragarhjile kii narnaul vidhansabha seat
 From where the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) candidate Rajesh Sihar left the field and joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 saal 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ke om prakaash ne apane nikatatam pratidwandi inelo ke kamalesh ko chaar hajaar se adhik vot ke antar se maat di thi
 BJP has once again nominated Om Prakash Yadav as its candidate from this Yadav-dominated seat
 tab congress tisare sthaan par rahi thi
 Congress has also placed a bet on Narendra Singh, who finished third this time
 rajesh sihaar ke maidan chhodane ke baad narnaul seat se kul aath ummidavaar chunavi ranbhumi main taal thok rahe hai
 For the first time since 1987, Kamalasan was only the second time in 2014 after 1987, when the BJP won the Narnaul seat
 yah doosraa hi avasar tha jabanaranaulamen camel khilaa tha
 Prior to Om Prakash, Kailash Chandra Sharma won the 1987 assembly election as a BJP candidate
 ab om prakaash ke saamne 2019 main bhi camel khilaae rakhane kii chunauti he
 What is the electoral past? Ramsharan Chandra Mittal of Congress was elected MLA in 1951 and 1954 elections after independence from Narnaul seat
 1957 main jansangh ke devakinandan ne mittal ko parajeet kar unka vijay rath roak diya tha
 Mittal was re-elected in 1962
 1967 menjansanghke banavaari laal chhakkad vidhayak chune gaye the
 Mittal was elected MLA in 1968
 1977 main ayodhya prasad ne narnaul main samaajwaad kaa paracham laharaaya
 In 1982 and 1987, Fusaram was elected MLA of Congress
 1996 main nirdaleey ne chakhaa jeet kaa swadasan 1996 ke chunaav main nirdaleey ummidavaar kailash chandra sharma ne jeet kaa swaad chakhaa
 The 2000 Kichunavi battle was independent versus independents and independent candidate Mularam defeated nearest rival Radheshyam
 2005 main bhi nirdaleey radheshyaam ne seat barkaraar rakhi

 Why does it happen that debates on communalism become a demonstration of the ability of reasoning
 is bahes main log ek duusare se jeetne kaa prayaas karne lagate hai
 Somebody wins in the debate but due to communalism these winners lose
 sabake paas kaaran he
 Everybody has names kisi ke paas samaadhaan nahin he
 The solution is not courageous
 azaadi ke pehle sab angrezon ko dangon kaa kaaran bataate the
 After independence, all give reasons to Congress, BJP and SP
 bas yahi fark aayaa he, kathith rup se karaane vaale kaa naam tab bhi pataa tha ab bhi pataa he
 The reason is also the same since seventy eighty years
 phir bhi ham funs jate hai
 There are some deficiencies within us that make us victims of this politics of violence
 tab jab zyaadaatar log hinsa ke khilaaf hai, phir bhi kuch log milakar hinsa ko anjaam dene main kaamyaab kaise ho jate hai
 Religion is often molded in this debate
 chand ninsafiyaan or gaiyr-barabariyon ko chunakar hinsa kii aag ko bhadakaayaa jaataa he
 Many flaws are counted to provoke emotions, but the enumerators do not say that there should be no riots
 aakhir kaise puri duniya main faile hindustani 15 agast ke din seenaa chaudaa kar kahenge ki ham sab ek hai
 What is the point of we are all one
 isamen hameen ham hai yaa is ham sab main baaki sab bhi hai
 If there is government subsidy on Haj pilgrimage then it is also on the Kumbh Mela, also on Kailash Mansarovar
 agar aise kuch udaahranon main asantulan he bhi to wo system kaa masalaa he
 Who is spreading this lack of system by creating poison in the society
 bijedy saansad tathagat satpati ne kaha ki maine pataa kiya bharat main laudspikar kab aayaa
 Before 1921 there were no loudspeakers at the temple mosque gurdwaras
 angrej ye system laae bheed ko kaabo karne main
 Tathagata had a good speech
 aaj vahi laudspikar bheed ko bekaabu or vahashi kar de rahaa he
 Whichever community died in the riots, due to which the person died must go through the incident or we should unite against it so that it does not happen again
 acchhee baat yah he ki 600 se adhik sampradayik hinsa ke aankade ginaye ja rahe hai
 Obviously, there will be hundreds of such incidents which may have been attempted to provoke, but did not happen
 wo isliye ki aap hinsa ke kilaaf hai
 Nevertheless, the allegation has once again come as an expectation for the Lok Sabha debate
 loksabhaa kii site par jaakar in bhaashanon ko pard sakate hai
 Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said that the riots are happening more in the same area and in the same state where elections are being held
 12 bai ilaction upi main he isliye polaraise karne ke liye vahaan par do maheene main 600 se adhik dange karwaae
 When we say something there, it is the responsibility of the ster government
 are state gavanarment kii kuch kamiyaan hai to wo jo karnaa he wo karenge lekin iske peeche aapke log jo kaam kar rahe hai jinako himmat ai he satta aane ke baad
 They are working to break the country
 to isliye harek ko dabaakar rakhane kii aapaki jo niti he ye niti bahut din nahin chalegi
 Communal incidents have occurred not only in UP but also in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan
 agar aap yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki rahul gandhi bole yaa nahin to nahin bole
 May be spoken on Thursday as the discussion continues
 khadge centre sarkaar ko nishaanaa banaakar bijepi ko mauka de rahe the ki wo unki sarkaar ko nishaanaa banaae
 The intention was fine but the speech was not effective
 bijepi kii taraf se gorakhpur ke saansad yogi adityanath bolne uthe
 He was exposing the same facts in his speech to prove that the front man did this
 wo apane ugr andaaz se saamne vaale kii kamazoriyon ko ujagar karte hue vishwasaneey to lag rahe the magar dhyaan se dekhne sunne par unki baton main waisi hi kamiyaan thi jaisi wo saamne vaale main dhund rahe the
 Adityanath said that the Hindu who is known inside the country and the world for his tolerance, he is displaced from Kashmir
 ek baar bhi is sadan main charchaa nahin hoti he
 Not once does anyone's mouth open when three and a half lakh Kashmiri Pandits are expelled from Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir main hinduon ko maarane ke baad kashmiri panditon ko unke ghar se bedakhal kar diya gaya, lekin ek bhi baar ye log bole nahin
 This in itself was a rare example in the world
 tathy yah he ki kashmiri panditon ko lekar sadan se lekar sadak tak par khub charchaa hui he
 In response, Mehbooba Mufti said that do not justify communalism by quoting Kashmiri Pandits
 ye hamaara system he jo ninsaphi karata he
 He does not even see Hindu Muslims
 magar ham dharm kaa naam dekar ladane lag jate hai
 We should talk about how violence should end
 mufti ne grih mantri se kaha ki aap record nikaal kar dekhiye
 When terrorism spread in Kashmir, people from all over the world came to fight, but none of our Muslims from Jammu and Kashmir came to become terrorists
 700 kashmiri pandit maare gaye to 50,000 kashmiri musalmaan bhi maare gaye
 My uncle was killed when my father was the Home Minister
 magar ye zarur hua, jab kashmiri panditon ko vahaan se nikalnaa padaa aapako us par taras aa gaya aapane unako jagah de di
 But when the Muslims came out from there, they could not find a place in the country, they are terrorists, get them out
 magar aaj hamaare kashmir kaa shawl vaala kaarobaar karne vaala puure mulk main jaataa he
 He does not complain to the people of the country who sells his things
 use shikaayat he to system se
 The policeman goes to someone's house to keep Kashmiri in his house and take it out
 mahabuuba ne saaf kiya ki ve aise udhaaharan dekar kisi kii barabari nahin kar rahi hai balki ye kaam band hona chahie
 We should think in the direction of solution
 milakar sochna chahie

 desh kii rajdhani main pichley saal metro or is saal metro- parking kaa kiraaya badhane ke baad ab auto kaa kiraaya badhaane ko lekar charchaa tej ho gai he
 The Delhi government has ordered the Transport Department to form an 'auto Fair Revision Committee'
 'ajtak' se exclusive baatcheet ke dauraan parivahan mantri kailash gahalot ne bataaya ki parivahan vibhaag kii 'auto fere revijan cameti' har pahalu par charchaa karegi
 After this, the final decision will be taken on whether to increase the fare or not
 gahalot ne aage bataaya ki sarkaar ke saamne auto union kii taraf se maang rakhi gai he
 Here it has been suggested to increase the auto fare citing inflation
 'auto fere revijan cameti' main alag- alag sarkari vibhaagon ke adhikari, transport vibhaag ke adhikari, tamaam auto union, rojaanaa auto main safar karne vaale yatriyon ke alaava enjio ko bhi charchaa ke liye shaamil kiya jayega
 When the Delhi Metro fare increased in the year 2017, the Aam Aadmi Party government strongly opposed it
 modi sarkaar or kejariwal sarkaar ke bich raajnneetik ghamaasan bhi hua
 Arvind Kejriwal has also expressed grief over the recent increase in the fare of metro parking, saying that this decision will increase congestion on roads and pollution in the city
 haalanki, pehle metro kiraye kaa virodh or ab autokiraaya badhaneke liye cameti par jab 'aap' sarkaar main parivahan mantri kailash gahalot se sawaal poocha gaya
 On this, he said that most unions are in favor of increasing the rent

 Kishan Verma has also accused the Delhi government of benefiting mobile app cab services like ola-uber
 aapako bataa den philhal puri dilli main 80 hajaar se zyada auto rickshaw hai
 These are especially helpful in terms of last mile connectivity
 dilli main parivahansaadhan mahange hone ke saath- saath parivahan vyavastha kaa majboot na hona bhi ek badi samasya he
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see what decision the 'fair Fair Revision Committee' of the Delhi Government takes on increasing the fare
