 Both these plans are valid for 20 telecom circles, where the company offers its services
 BSNL ke 199 rupee vaale IPL richarge kii baat vistaar se karen to isamen keval home cirkil main analimited wais colling di jaaegi
 That is, users traveling in other circles will be charged at standard rate for voice calls

 The ongoing controversy over Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavat has not stopped
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan film par jari vivaad charam par pahunch gaya tha
 The film was not released on December 1 last year due to lack of clearance from the censors
 'padmavat' dekhnaa to dur, shiv'raaj' main ghumar gaanaa bajaane tak par roak!sansadeey cameti se guzarane or sensor kii aupchaariktaaon ko puraa karne ke baavjood film ko lekar uthaa toofaan abhi khatm nahin hua he
 One by one, four bjp-ruled states have announced a ban on the film
 bain lagane vaala sabase nayaa rajya haryana he
 Interestingly, when BJP leaders were criticizing the film a few days ago, Manohar Lal Khattar dismissed the possibility of any ban on the film
 haryana ke kadam se yah bhi ashanka he ki duusare bijepi shasit rajyon par film bain karne ko lekar dabaav hoga
 In fact, a few days ago, Chief Ministers and other leaders of Uttarakhand, UP and other BJP ruled states had said things like banning the film
 maharashtra or goa main bhi film ke khilaaf bayaan aae hai
 According to the reports, the Mumbai Police has also raised concerns with the state government about the film's performance
 goa police ne tourist sijan kaa hawala dete hue suraksha kaarnon se isaki relies par ashanka jataai he
 Both these states have BJP governments
 25 nahin 24 ko hi relies hogi padmavat, 4 rajyon main bain ke khilaaf supreme court pahunche nirmaataniche ham desh kaa jo nakshaa dikhaa rahe hai, unamem naarangi rang vaale rajyon main film bain kii ja chuki he
 While in the green BJP ruled areas, the issue of ban on the film is 50-50
 isamen maharashtra, goa ke alaava upi, uttarakhand, chhattisgarh, jharkhand, assam jaise rajya hai
 The mehrun colored areas which have states like Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Tripura and Jammu and Kashmir are ruled by the BJP and its allies
 yahaan film ke bain hone kii ashanka kam he
 In UP, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said to ban the first, accusing history of tampering
 haalanki film kii nai relies date aane ke baad isapar unka koi bayaan nahin aayaa he
 The areas where the film's performance is most threatened, Hindi films have the highest audience
 ek tareeke se dekhen to agar film bain hui to nirmaataaon ko karodon rupee kaa nuksaan hoga
 The total budget of this film is 180 crores
 vycom18 ne film main sabase zyada paisa lagaaya he
 a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court on behalf of Viacom 18, the producer of the film Padmavat, due to Nirmatabain having reached the Supreme Court
 jisamen chaar rajyon dwaara film ke pradarshan par bain ke khilaaf guhaar lagaai gai he
 The Supreme Court may soon hear the petition

 The sensor has given the film a "U / A" certificate with five modifications

 pm's rally on Birsa and Jaipal Munda's land, treason charges against 10 thousand people in Khunti, tribal tribal Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to address the election meeting in Khunti, Jharkhand today
 khunti jharkhand kii vah jameen he jahaan par bharat ke do nayakon ne janm liya tha
 These two heroes, descended from a typical pastoral background, shone as stars in different fields on the strength of their struggle and vitality
 ham baat kar rahe hai birsa munda or jaipal singh munda kii
 Born in Ulihatu village of Khunti, Birsa Munda is among the Adi Nayaks of the tribal society
 maatr 25 saal main shahid hone vaale birsa munda ne british satta ke khilaaf ulgulaan yani kranti kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 In a short period, they drove the British from the jungles of Jharkhand many times
 munda janajati ke is noujvaan ne apni urja or sanghathan kshamta se angrejon ke chakke chhudaa die
 Jaipal Singh, born on the earth of peg, was a staunch player of Munda hockey
 inaki aguwai main british bharat ne olympic main hockey gold medal jeeta tha
 Jaipal Singh Munda later started doing politics in Jharkhand
 jaipal singh munda un chuninda netaaon main se the jinhone aazaadee se pehle hi alag jharkhand kaa sapana dekha tha
 Munda formed an institution called Adivasi Mahasabha
 jab desh kaa samvidhan likhane kii baari ai to oxford main padhe jaipal singh munda samvidhan sabha ke yogya sadsy bane
 The tribals of the birsa-jaipal tradition fear of treason Surprisingly, the tribals of Birsa Munda and Jaipal Singh Munda traditions are today facing the fear of colonial law like treason
 buudhvaar (3 disambar) ko jab pradhanmantri narendra modi is ilaake main janata se vot maangane ke liye aaenge to ye sawaal unke saamne khadaa hoga
 In fact, hundreds of thousands of tribal youth from villages around this peg are accused under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code
 sawaal uthta he ki aakhir in adivaasiyon kaa kasoor kya he jo police ne inhen is gambhir 'aparaadh' kaa aaropee banaaya he
 The Khunti police are alleged to have registered sedition cases against villagers and tribals on a large scale
 scrol dot in kii ek report ke anusaar khunti main 11,200 logon ke khilaaf cese darj hue
 In which about 10,000 people are accused of treason
 samajhen patthalgadi andolanapatthalgadi adivasee samaaj kaa ek rivaaj he, jo saalon se chal rahaa he
 The Munda, Oraon and Santhal tribes in Chotanagpur follow this practice
 iske tahat adivasee apane mritak purakhon kii yaad main apane gaanv, angan yaa kisi pavitra jagah par ek pathar gaadte hai
 This process is called Pathalgadi
 is prakriya kaa tarika alag he, lekin iskaa makasad he mrityu praapt kar chuke apane priyajanon ko yaad karnaa
 Dr
 Shanti Khalkho, teacher of Vinoba Bhave University, Hazaribagh, Jharkhand, says that like marriage, death, Pathalgadi is also a rite of tribal society
 sanskaar se sarkaar ko dikkat kyon?patthalgadi parampariha tak to thik thi
 It was being followed for the last three to four years in about 200 villages of Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal
 lekin dikkat tab paidaa hui jab is parampara kaa raajnneetik swarup saamne aayaa
 In fact, some vigilant tribals in Khunti buried the land on the ground by writing the rights given to the tribals under the Constitution on big stones under this movement
 vivaad kii jad in pattharon par likhe kathan hai
 Stones buried under Pathalgadi (file photo-aaj Tak) Assistant Professor at the University of Delhi and belonging to the Oraon tribe, Nitisha Khalkho, says that in the area identified under the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution, the external settlement will have to be brought in with permission
 diku yani ki gaiyr rudhi pratha ke vyaktiyon kaa is kshetra main swatantra rup se ghumna-phirana or nivas karnaa varjit he
 Professor Nitisha says that Pathalgadi describes what rights have been given to the tribals in the constitution
 haalanki unka kahana he ki ye kaam sarkaar ko karnaa chahie tha, lekin sarkaar alag alag tareeke se adivaasiyon kii jindagi main hastkshep karne lagi
 After this, the tribals were forced to perform Patthalgadi
 unhone kaha ki samvidhan main adivaasiyon kii marji par chhod diya gaya tha, ki wo kaise menstream hota he, lekin aazaadee ke baad kii uttarottar sarkaron ne ise bhuulaa diya
 Neither Lok Sabha nor Vidhan Sabha, above all, is the slogan of the Gramsabhapathalgadi movement
 na loksabhaa na vidhansabha, sabase upar gramsabha
 It is written on the stones buried under Pathalgadi that no general law of Parliament or Assembly is applicable under Article 244 (1) Part (c) Para (5) (1) of the Constitution of India in the Fifth Schedule Districts or Areas
 yani ki is ilaakon main gramsabha sarvopari he or yahaan gramsabha ke dwaara banaae gaye niyam hi lagu honge
 The teacher of Vinoba Bhave University, Dr
 Shanti Khalkho, says that the gram sabha had the responsibility of preparing the model of governance in the areas which come in the fifth schedule
 lekin gramsabha jab apana kaam karne lagi to sarkaar ko pareshaani hone lagi
 He says that society is also being formed in the cities where the entry of common people is prohibited, but then no one objects
 dow shanti ke mutabik paanchavin anusoochi ke tahat aane vaale kshetron main panchayach chunaav or nagar nigam chunaav karaane kaa niyam nahin tha
 But these elections are also being held in these areas
 unhone kaha ki jab samvidhan bana tha to nehru chaahate the ki adivasee samaaj kaa bahari duniya se sampark kam rahe
 Treason accusations False Adivasis call the accusation of treason on them as false
 professor nitisha kahati hai ki aaropon kii vajah se dar se log gaanv main rahanaa nahin chaahate hai
 She says that the present government wants to celebrate diversity, it wants uniformity, but the culture of tribals is different
 unka kahana he ki patthalgadi andolan saamaanya, sajag adivasee disha de rahe hai, jo dasvin paas hai graduate hai
 The tribals have appealed to PM Narendra Modi to do justice to them
 dow shanti khalakho kahati hai ki adivaasiyon ko bahut zyada nahin chahie, lekin agar unke paas jeene laayak bhi nahin rahane diya jayega , to log udwelit honge hi
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni (mahi) has been the most successful captain in the history of Indian cricket
 mahendra singh dhonine bharat kii ore se 199 maichon main captaini kii he, jisamen unhone 110 maichon main jeet hasil kii, jabaki 74 muqablon main unhen haar mili
 It is not that he has done these miracles overnight, his years of hard work and focus is behind this
 dhoni ne chodi vanade or tii-20 kii captaini, kaha- teenon formet main ek captain jaruriab jabaki ve captain pad se hatane kii baat kah chuke hai to log is soch main hai ki kya desh ko un jaisaa captain phir mil paaegaa yaa nahin
 Surprisingly, Dhoni not only took the command of the Indian cricket team but also created history by moving out of a small town like Jamshedpur
 logon ke bich unki deewangi kaa alam ye he ki unke jivan par bani film ko bhi logon ne ratorat superhit bana diya tha
 You also know the success spells of Dhoni, which make him a legend
 
 
 hameshaa jadon se jude rahe- dhoni ko safalataa mili to bhi unhen ye yaad rahaa ki unki jaden kya rahi hai
 Under what circumstances have they reached this point? yahi vajah he ki ve aaj bhi apane sangharsh ke dinon ke saathiyon se sampark main hai
 He is known as Mr
 Cool - though the whole world knows him as Captain Cool
 ek shaks jo behadvipareet paristhitiyonmen bhi apana aapa nahin khota
 Motivates others constantly
 saathiyon par puraa vishwaas- khud sakasham hone ke baavjood bhi dusron ko mauka dena ve khub jaanate hai
 They use it as a strategy for trust
 isliye kai baar aisa hota he ki ve mushkil paristhitiyon main over un khiladiyon ko dete najar aae hai jin par sabhi ko andeh rahaa he
 Love not to be forgotten - even when he decided to marry his childhood friend, he stayed away from all kinds of controversies
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki ve is kadar popular hai
 They also fulfill what they promise
 vivaadon se rahe dur- chaahe team main kisi kaa chunaa janaa ho yaa phir baahar janaa, stritji kii baat ho yaa match phixing kaa maamla
 
 
 Modi has always been a clean chit
 dilli or uske aasapaas ke ilaakon menmahilaon ke prati badhate aparaadhako dekhte hue gudgaanv jila prashasan mahila driver vaale cab or auto chalaane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 The Gurgaon district administration is working on a scheme under which around 250 women will be groomed as drivers
 jila prashasan ke is yojana main bank, tata motors or prashikshan dene vaali sanstha rudset or sthaneey police kii bhi bhagidaari tay kii gai he
 This scheme is seeing a lot of happiness in women who use public transport every day
 in mahilaon kaa maananaa he ki is pahal se mahilaayein khud ko surakshit mahasoos karengi
 The good thing is that many women will also get employment through this scheme
 darasal pichley kaaphi samay se lagaataar mahilaon ke saath ho rahe rape or chhedchhad ke maamalon main paaya gaya he ki zyaadaatar maamle taxi or auto main yatra ke dauraan hue hai or aisi ghatnaon ko anjaam dene main taxi or auto driver hi shaamil rahe hai
 However, this process may take two months to complete
 jila prashasan aisi texiyon ko ek alag rang or naam degaa
 In the Kashiram Colony in Lohia town of Kharkhauda police station area of meerut, 6 people were burnt alive due to fire in a house in the Kashiram Colony, while two suffered burns
 ghayalon ko aspataal me bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 UP: Scorching death of brother and sister in the fire caused the incident in the area
 aag kaa kaaran abhi saaf nahin ho sakaa lekin sthaneey logon kii maane to subah bijli ke short circuit ke kaaran aag lagi he
 On the other hand, even after the information, there was a rage against the administration on the arrival of the officers
 holikaa dahan ke dauraan dhamaakaa, 14 jhulaselogon ne hangaamaa karte hue shavon ko postmortem ke liye uthaane se man kar diya or ambulance ko maukey se hataa diya
 But later the authorities pacified the people and sent the bodies for postmortem
 marane waalon main se ghar ke mukhiya kaa naam parvej bataaya ja rahaa he
 a new book states that the Unique Identification Scheme can be used effectively to protect the poor from plunder and prevent the rich from corruption
 yojana ko prabhavi banane kii jaruratpatrkaar or vishleshak shankar ayyar ne apni kitaab ‘accidental india: e history of da neshns pasej thru chrysis and change’ main likhaa, ‘garibon ko lut se bachaane or amiron ko bhrashtachar se rokane ke liye ek tarika vishisht pahchaan yojana ko prabhavi tareeke se amal main laana he

 ’ ayyar ne kaha ki is database kaa istemaal bhavishya ke sudhaar ke aadhaar ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 This includes marketing services to cash transfers to the poor
 dilli chunaav ko lekar media sarvebhale aam aadmi party ke paksh main hon, lekinpradhanmantri narendra modi unhen sire se galat bataa rahe hai
 To prove Modi's point, his commander-in-chief Amit Shah has given all the strength
 chunaav prachaar ke aakhri daur membijapi ne apane sabhi 70 ummidavaaron ko road sho karne kaa hukum diya he
 All the candidates have been asked to reach maximum areas between 11 to 4 pm
 tab tak jab tak ayog isaki ijaajat detaa ho
 The last-minute hiatus probably would not have happened if the BJP had taken note of these 10 points
 maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand main bijepi ne modi lahar ko aajamaaya or safal rahi
 In Delhi too, the BJP felt that this would work
 jab kejariwal ne ek-ek kar bijepi netaaon ko target karnaa shuru kiya to use ek majboot chehre kii jarurat mahasoos hui
 Harshvardhan's image was good but BJP did not trust him this time
 pichley chunaav main unhen unke phase vailu ke bharose hi maidan main utaara gaya tha – or siten batorne ke maamle main to kam se kam ve awwal bhi rahe
 If Dao was played on them, it could have been more effective
 2
 Kiran Bedi could prove to be a good candidate as Kejriwal's cut, but the party took a long time to project her as the chief ministerial candidate
 bijepi ko iskaa puraa phayda nahin mil paaya
 The BJP played a master stroke, but quite late
 3
 The BJP did not take senior leaders into confidence before bringing in Kiran Bedi
 yahaan tak ki unki choti-choti maangon ko bhi nazarandaaj kiya
 Delhi BJP president Satish Upadhyay was not even given a ticket, so his supporters continued to create chaos for several days
 tikat bantwaare ko lekar or bhi kai netaa netritv se naaraaz rahe
 If this quarrel was prevented from going public, the competition would have been different
 4
 Kiran Bedi had taken the training of an outstanding police officer and only after that she performed brilliantly in the field
 magar jab wo raajnneeti main ain to thik se unka induction bhi nahin ho sakaa
 If BJP had given them a little training in politics, then the matter would have been different
 ‘hamen thanedaar nahin, netaa chahie’ jaisi uthati awaajon ko bijepi netritv ne jabaran dabaa diya
 If these things had been taken care of, then perhaps Kiran Bedi would have been able to connect with the people - and everyone would have been comfortable in communicating
 5
 Kiran Bedi neither directly connected with her voters nor won the hearts of the workers
 unki prachaar team ke narendra tandon ke istife ke baad bhale hi unki ghar vaapasi ho gai ho, lekin sab kuch thik thaak chal rahaa tha ye to nahin kaha ja saktaa
 6
 bijepi kii mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaar dilli ko lekar apana agenda to bataati raheen, lekin vot modi ke naam par maangati raheen
 This thing seems to have faded slightly before the Kejriwal brand
 kiran bedi ko khud apane hi brands kaa koi khaas phayda nahin mil paaya
 Safety of women was a big issue in Delhi, but BJP could not convince people that there can be no better alternative than Kiran Bedi for this
 7
 Corruption was a big issue in Delhi, and probably will continue [unless there is a concrete solution]
 bijepi ne ise halke main liya, jabaki kejariwal logon ko bhrashtachar kaa mudda or uske liye lokapal kii jarurat ke bare main lagaataar samajhaate rahe
 BJP presented the vision document in place of the manifesto, but the ritual payment appeared in the name of corruption
 khaskar tab jabaki pratidwandvi aap jor shor se bataati rahi ki vah bhrashtachar kaa khaatmaa kar degi
 8
 kejariwal ko target karne ke liye bijepi ne aam aadmi party kii funding main ghapale kii baat ko hawa di
 BJP may have forgotten that there may be other ways to surround Kejriwal but such things will prove to be airborne
 bijepi ne yah bhi samajhane kii koshish nahin kii ki kejariwal kis tarah kiran bedi par sidhe hamale ke bajaae unhen miss-feet bataate rahe
 9
 bijepi ko laga ki agar modi lahar thodi feeki padi to kiran bedi kii chhavi sari kasar puri kar degi
 This saved the BJP its traditional middle class vote bank, but a large section was left behind
 jhuggi-jhopadi waalon yaa aap ke dedicated vot bank main bijepi send nahin laga pai
 If the BJP could have made a small inroads among those voters then it would not have been so bad
 10
 Despite losing all the seven seats in Delhi in the Lok Sabha elections, the ruling BJP at the Center delayed to conduct the assembly elections
 bijepi ko ye baat bhale samaj main na ai ho magar aap ne pehle hi bhaanp liya tha
 Taking lessons from the mistakes of the Lok Sabha elections, AAP focused on Delhi
 aap haryana chunaav se dur rahi lekin bijepi ko isaki bhanak tak na lagi
 If the BJP had known in time, it would have been different
 haniprit kii hakeekat jameen par aa chuki he
 He has to tell now what is the reality of Panchkula violence
 ram rahim ke gunahon kii hakeekat kya he
 What is the reality of those who saved him for 38 days
 iske liye mangalvaar kii shaam se mahila police afasaron kii team haniprit se sawaal-jawaab kar rahi he
 The question-and-answer process has started with Honeypreet in the presence of 3 female police officers and one male officer along with Chandigarh's Chandi Mandal police station IG Mamta Singh
 haniprit se puche gaye ye sawaal- pichley 38 din se wo kahaan chhipi thi?- 25 agast ko rohtak kii sunaaria jail se lautne ke baad wo kahaan gai?- 25 agast kii raat se lekar 3 oktober tak wo kahaan-kahaan gai?- is dauraan kis-kis ne uski madad kii thi?- deraa samarthakon kii hinsa main uski kya bhoomika thi?- kya ram rahim ko jail pahunchane se pehle hi bhagane kii yojana thi?- ram rahim ko bhagane ke liye kya yojana banaai gai thi?- haniprit se sawaal hua ki 25 agast ko itane hajaaron deraa samarthak kyon jute the?- deraa samarthakon ko kisne or kisalie bulaayaa tha?- abtak faraar chal rahe aditya insaan or pawan insa ke bare main haniprit ko kya jaankaree he?in sawaalon ke mili jawaab- haniprit 25 agast se hi aditya, pawan, rohtash ke sampark main thi
 - He used to talk to all of them on whatsapp
 - kahin bhi simple colling kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 - Honeypreet had international numbers
 ram rahim ke saare gunahon ke raaj!haniprit se sawaal-jawaab kaa silsilaa mangalvaar kii der raat tak jari rahaa

 jammu-kashmir ke kupwada jile main shuukravaar ko niyantran rekha par pakistani sainikon ke sangharsh viraam ulanghan main sena ke do adhikari shahid ho gaye
 An army official said that Pakistan fired without provocation at 11
55 am in the Keran sector
 golibari main ek junior kamishand adhikari (jesio) shahid ho gaya or ek anya ghayal ho gaya jinaki baad main aspataal main maut ho gai
 He said that the Indian Army gave a befitting reply to the ceasefire violation
 (input bhashaa se) Everything does not look right between the two most talented players of Team India, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli
 khabar he ki bristben test match main donon khilaadiyon ke bich, jo matbhed shuru hua to abhi tak sulajh nahin paaya he
 The case started on the fourth day of the second Test match of the series, when Shikhar Dhawan's wrist suffered an injury during practice before the match and he did not take the field to bat
 natijatan viraat kohli ko ballebaaji karne janaa padaa or yaheen se kohli kaa paara garam ho gaya
 He was angry that he did not get time to prepare mentally for batting, although this was ridiculous by former captain Sunil Gavaskar as many times openers would have got less time to get ready to bat
 Is, but the point here was the credibility of Virat Kohli, who had scored a century in both innings of the last match
 kohli pari main naakaam rahe or ek ran banaakar, unhen michel johnson ne out kar diya
 In the dressing room, he accused Shikhar of deliberately exaggerating his injury and in reality he did not want to face the Australian bowlers
 bas phir kya tha, apni moochon par taav dete shikhar ne kohli ko turant jawaab de diya ki vah kisi gedambaj se nahin darate or Had his injury not been serious, he would have gone to bat
 shikhar jab ballebaaji karne gaye or apni 81 ranon kii pari main unhone kuch aise shots khele, jinhen aap ek chotil kalai ke saath haragiz nahin khel sakate to kohli ne apane aarope dressing room main phir se dohraye
 It is believed that Ravi Shastri tried to make a reconciliation between the two and he succeeded to a great extent, but phir bhi donon main wo garm joshi nahin dekhi ja rahi, jo pehle thi
 Some even believe that the real root of the matter begins with the days spent by both the players in the Delhi Ranji team
 kohli jab nae-nae dilli kii team main aae the to team main senior shikhar unhen zyada tavajjo nahin dete the
 But by coming to Team India, the case turned upside down, where Kohli is now the captain of Shikhar
 ab maamle kii asli hakeekat to donon khilaadi yaa phir team management hi jaanate hai, lekin na jane kyon saalon se bharat ke salaami ballebaaz or bhartiya captainon ke bich man-mutaav kii baaten kabhi thamane kaa naam hi nahin letin

 unhone nilamban avadhi ko puraa karne ke baad is saal vaapasi kii he
 When Virat Kohli was asked about the match against Pakistan, he talked about the return of America
 kohli ne kaha, ‘mujhe pakistan ke khilaaf khilne main kuch bhi alag nahin lagata
 That is cricket

 Matches against Pakistan are definitely competitive
 log bhale hi utsaahi ho jate hon lekin khilaadiyon ke liye yah match vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa kisi anya team ke khilaaf

 security incharge se shikaayat karne ke baad darshakon ko chetavanee di gai
 But Aamir only 8
 1 overs daalane ke baad maidan se baahar chale gaye
 The way in which three wickets in the first ODI after the return, is the evidence of how talented he is
 1 over main 28 ran dekar 3 wicket jatke
 However the Pakistan team could not save the match and lost by 70 runs
 isse pehle newjiland ke khilaaf hi aamir ne teen tii-20 match bhi khele the, jisamen unhen sirf ek wicket mila tha
 The court had sent the jail to Mohammad Aamir suspended from international cricket for five years due to his role in spot-fixing during the 2010 Test match against England at Lord's
 november 2011 main teen pakistani cricketer mohammad aamir, salmaan bat or mohammad asif ko landan kii ek adaalat ne match phixing main doshi qaraar diya tha or unhen chah maheene ke liye jail kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 After this, the ICC also banned him for five years, which ended on September 1 last year

 The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly took action against the Congress mlas a day after this incident of misbehavior
 buudhvaar ko punjab vidhaan sabha congressi vidhayakon ke is abhadra vyavhaar ke drishyon kaa gavaah bana tha
 Congress mps accusing his party office of raiding the police came near the chair of the Legislative Assembly and threw papers, books and documents and misbehaved with the marshals
 puure din ke liye nilambit kiye gaye vidhayakon main jagmohan singh kong, charanjit singh channi, raja amrendra singh varring, rana gurjeet singh, sukhjinder singh randhaava, hardayal kamboj, kulajit nagara, balbir singh siddhu or harmohinder singh pinki shaamil hai

 telugana kii siyaasi zamin ekadam se nayab he
 This is not just because this new state of India is holding elections for the first time
 vajah he yahaan siyasat ke paanch khilaadi,siyaasi pich par ek samay me hi raajnneeti ke do khel, khel rahe hai
 The elections of Chhattisgarh, Mizoram and Madhya Pradesh were held in the five states whose assembly elections were declared simultaneously
 rajasthan or telugana main 7 disambar ko vot padenge
 Apart from Telangana, the contest in four states of Banki is between the ruling and main opposition parties
 yah baat vaise to telugana par bhi lagu he lekin yahaan kaa chunaav alag isliye he kyonki yahaan ke chunaav nattejey 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi ke khilaaf banane baale gathbandhan kii na sirf niv rakhenge, balki uski takat or josh kaa mujayara bhi karenge
 The BJP is also understanding this and, anti-modi political parties also understand this
 ye he siyaasi kheltelugana ke mukhyamantri ke
 Chandrasekhar Rao took the initiative to form a third front against Modi at the Center
 iske liye wo pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee se bhi mulaakaat kar teesraa morcha banane kaa elaan kiya tha
 Later, when Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu parted ways with the BJP, Chandrashekhar Rao stopped talking about the Third Front and started getting closer to Modi
 raav ne samay se aath maheenaa pehle telugana vidhansabha bhang kar di or chunaav main utar gaye
 Sources say, he took the decision to dissolve the Legislative Assembly ahead of time because he estimated that the Congress would be the only main opposition party against him in the state
 aise main majboot vipaksh ke abhaav main wo emm (owesi kii party) se samjhauta kar bada bahumat hasil kar lenge
 After the assembly elections, he has no problem in going with the NDA
 chunki rajya main muslimon kii aabaadi 14 fisadi se adhik he or rajya ke 40 vidhansabha siton par muslimo kaa acha prabhaav he is kaaran vidhaan sabha chunaav se pehle endie ke saath jane se unhen nuksaan hone kaa khatra mahasoos ho rahaa tha
 The second reason was that if Rao had gone to the NDA before the assembly elections, the MIM could have gone with the Congress, thus the relatively weak opposition (congress) in the state would have been strengthened
 lihaaj unhone endie main jane kaa patta khole bina, vidhaan sabha ke chunaav main jane kaa faisla kar liya
 Naidu did not even know that Bisatrao had laid down, only a week after the decision to dissolve the assembly, a lot of electorate will come in front of him
 andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ne saptaah bhar ke andar hi, kattar virdohi congress ke saath milakar telugana main chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar diya
 Congress also joined hands
 phir telugana janasmiti or bampanthi dal ne mil kar tiares ke khilaaf prajakutami bana diya
 This alliance is giving a strong fight to Rao in Telangana
 prajakutami telugana main yah charchaa karne main safal ho rahaa he ki tiares, modi ke saath he
 Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of Congress in Lok Sabha, says that 'TRS is bjp's b team'
 haalanki naidu ne jo siyaasi bisaat bichaai he uskaa telugana kii raajnneeti se koi bada ken dena nahi he
 Actually he wants to be the architect of united opposition against Modi in 2019
 tidipi ke netaa kehete hai ki, ' naidu 2019 main modi virdohi dalon ko telugana ke chunaav se yah sandesh dena chaah rahe hai ki, nijee hiton ko dur rakh kar modi ke khilaaf ekajute hona jaruri he
 This is the reason why TDP is contesting only 13 seats in 119-seat Telangana this time, while 15 party mlas won in the last election
 yah 100 seat par congress lard rahi he
 Shah's most successful strategist of the BJP, party president Amit Shah, is making his face in Telangana for 2019
 bhaajapa netaa paroksh rup se kehete hai ki, telugana main hamaari takat itani nahi kii sarkaar bana len
 In such a situation, we have two objectives
 pehla to yah ki ham pichhali baar kii 5 siton kii sankhya badhaakar 10 kar len
 If this happens and the TRS lacks some of the leaders to form the government, then the BJP can play a role in forming the government
 doosraa yah ki, jo vot bhaajapa ko nahi milte he (muslim) wo vot virdohi dalon (congress-tidipi) ke paas jane se, bhaajapa ke ghoshit yaa paroksh madadgaar (tiares) ko mili
 In other ways, the atmosphere of Telangana's Muslim vote going to bjp's place is being created and BJP is also trying for it
 kul milakar telugana ke 1 siyaasi pich par shiyasat ke 2 khel, 5 khilaadi (tiares, tidipi, congress, emm or bhaajapa) 1 saath khel rahi he
 On December 11, the day of the election results, you will know what was happening and won

 upi main shiya vakf board ke adhyakshawasim rizvike khilaaf fatwa jari kiya gaya he
 The fatwa is issued by Ayatollah al-syed Ali al-husseini al-sistani from the Shia community's supreme religion, Iraq
 bataa den ki wasim rizvi ke supreme court main vakf board kii sampatti ko ayodhya menram mandirke nirmaan ke liye die jane sambandhit prastaav par yah fatwa aayaa he
 Ayatollah Sistani, the supreme religious leader of the Shias, said in his letter that the land of the Shia Waqf Board could not be given to people of any other religion to build a shrine or for religious work
 iske baad rizvi ke bayanon or unke mandir maamle main pairokaar banane par sawaal uthne lage
 Wasim Rizvi had filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking to make the Shia Board an advocate
 saath hi yah bhi elaan kar rakhaa tha ki agar supreme court ayodhya kii vivaadit jameen shiya board ko waapas karata he to wo ise mandir banane ke liye de denge
 This was followed by Dr
 Shia intellectual and management guru of Kanpur
 mazhar abbaas nakvi ne iran sthit sistani ke offis main i-mail bhejkar fatwa maanga tha
 Abbas is the husband of the female city qazi doctor Hina Naqvi of the Shia Sharai court
 maamle par nakvi kaa kahana he kii yah maamla sarvocch nyaayayal main vichaaradhin he or wasim rizvi ne jo kaha he ki mandir nirmaan ke liye apni sampatti dene ko taiyaar he to yah samajhnaa hoga kii 70 saal baad unhone yah maang kyon kii
 In 1946, it was declared through the court that this property is of the Sunni Waqf Board
 ab unhone jab yah prastaav diya to hamane poocha tha ki apane sarvocch dharmaguru aakaa sistani se i-mail ke jariye poocha tha kii kya koi musalmaan vakf kii sampatti ko kisi mandir yaa kisi duusare dharm kii ibaadadgaah ke liye de saktaa he to unka yah jawaab aayaa he kii yah mumkin nahin he
 According to Naqvi, now Rizvi should withdraw her petition after this edict
 kyonki ab inke is prastaav kaa koi auchity nahin rah gaya he
 They should stop the useless rhetoric and press its note
 agar ve aisa nahin karte he to shiya yaa musalmaan kahalaane ke adhikari bhi nahin rah jaayenge
 After this fatwa, All India Sunni Ulama Council President Haji Salis says that after the fatwa, now Shia religion guru Kalwe Sadiq will have to think whether Wasim Rizvi should be the chairman of Waqf Board or not
 wasim rizvi ne aarope lagaaya he ki unke upar antarrashtriya str se dabaav banaaya ja rahaa he ki vah ram mandir maamle ke pairokaar se khud ko alag karen or yahi vajah he ki shiyaon ke dharmaguru ko gumraah kar unase aise fatve mangaaye ja rahe hai
 Rizvi has issued a press release saying that the supreme religious leader of Shia and Maulana Ayatollah Sistani of Iran have been misled and called a fatwa
 taaki ram mandir par shiya central vakf board kaa paksh kamjor kiya ja sake

 It has not been even a year since US President Donald Trump came to power, but his successive decisions have been causing headaches internationally
 khabar he ki raashtrapati trump buudhvaar ko yerusalem ko isroyal kii rajdhani ke rup main sweekaar kar sakate hai
 US officials say Trump may recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital in his speech today
 is khabar ke aate hi ek baar phir antarrashtriya str par khaskar khadi deshon main tanaav kaa maahaul ban gaya he
 Saudi Arabia's Sultan Salman, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Jordan's Sultan Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdulfatah al-sisi feared that the situation could worsen internationally
 gauratlab he ki yerusalem, isroyal or falstiniyon ke bich vivaad kaa sabase gambhir mudda he
 If America accepts Jerusalem as Israel's capital, then it will be the first country to do so after the birth of Israel, that is, after 1948
 ek nazar daalate hai yerusalem ko isroyal kii rajdhani ghoshit karne ke alaava raashtrapati trump ke wo 5 anya faisle jiske bhavishya main vaishvik str par gambhir parinaam ho sakate hamparis deal se hatanasaal ke madhya main raashtrapati trump kaa paryaavaran santulan ke liye kiye gaye paris samjhaute se america ke hatane kii ghoshnaa karnaa duniya ko chaunkaane vaala tha
 The Paris Agreement is the first comprehensive climate change agreement globally, a consensus reached in 2015 among leaders around the world to bring the global average temperature rise below two degrees Celsius
 aisa karne ke liye duniyabar ke deshon ne carbon utsarjan main kami laane kaa vaada kiyamerica kii ore se tatkaaleen raashtrapati baraak obama ne sitambar 2016 main is par hastakshar kiya tha
 The US is one of the largest carbon emitting countries, and its removal may lead other countries to take a similar approach
 aisa hone par paryaavaran ko santulit rakhane ke abhiyaan par vyapak asar pad saktaa he
 Travel ban on Muslim countries Another controversial decision of Trump was to ban people from 6 Muslim countries Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from coming to America
 isi saal janvari main satta main aane ke baad unhone yatra pratibandh sambandhi vivaadaaspad niti kaa praaroop jari kiya tha
 However, this decision was not only opposed in his country but also criticized all over the world
 ab america supreme court ne bhi 6 muslim deshon ke khilaaf yatra pratibandh ke raashtrapati trump ke faisle par rajamandi dete hue ise puri tarah lagu karne kaa nirdesh de daalaa he
 Seven of the 9 judges of the Supreme Court accepted the request of the Trump administration seeking removal of the ban imposed by the lower courts on the imposition of the travel ban
 iske alaava unhone uttar korea or venezuela ke kuch sarkari adhikariyon ke america aane par pratibandh laga rakhaa he
 Decision to withdraw from UNESCO In October, Donald Trump shocked the world once again with the decision to withdraw from UNESCO
 america ne tab unesco par ' isroyal virdohi' hone kaa aarope lagaaya or iskaa saath chhod diya
 Apart from accusations of bias on UNESCO, it had expressed the need to improve it, raising concerns about the increasing economic burden of the organization
 unesco puri duniya main vishwa dharohar sthal chunane ke liye janaa jaataa he
 In addition, it is a multilateral institution that works for the goals related to education and development (sex education, literacy and equality of women)

 mexico seemaa par diwareashtrapati trump ne apane chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan kai baar mexican seemaa par diwaar banane kaa vaada kiya tha or ab vah is disha main kaaphi aage bad chuke hai

 diwaar banane ko lekar trump ne kaha tha ki america kii dakshini seemaa par sankat ke halaat hai or aisa karne se avaidh tareeke se ghuspaith or nashili dawaaon kii taskari par ankush lagegasima par kareeb 2,000 mile lambii abhedya diwaar banane ke liye kancreet or steel se bane 9 meter lambey kuch namoonay taiyaar kiye gaye hai, jis par sheersh str se sahmati milane ke baad kaam shuru ho jayega
 However, it will not be easy because the border passes through empty plains, dusty deserts, lush green terrain and the harsh environment of Rio Grande which will cost hugely to get entangled with North Korea
 Continuously provoking, and even America does not seem to be in a mood to spare him
 haal hi main uttar korea ke intercontinental belistic missile (ibiem) ke nae test ko america raksha mantri ne duniya ke liye khatra bataaya tha
 Earlier in September, he had done his biggest test so far (sixth nuclear test)
 uttar korea ko lekar trump kii naaraazgi jagajaahir he or use aisa narak bataaya jahaan kisi ko bhi nahin rahanaa chahieuttar korea or america ke bich tanatani kaa asar puri duniya ko bhugatna pad saktaa he
 If America battles with him to teach a lesson, then other countries will also fall prey to it

 ( input bhashaa se) The central government has changed the rules for Leave Travel Concession (LTC) of state-run banks and financial institutions
 ab tak vahaan koi upyukt niyam nahin tha or is bare main beyimaani kii tarah-tarah kii shikaayatein aa rahi thim
 According to an economic newspaper, the government has issued new guidelines in this regard
 ab tak is bare main kai samgr niyam yaa kanoon nahin tha, jiskaa jamkar durupyog ho rahaa tha
 Now the new rules will not only curb them but their claims will also be reduced
 sarkari bainkon, pratishthanon, beemaa companiyon or anya regulatory sansthaaon ke karmchaariyon ko jo LTC miltaa he, uske bare main sarkaar ke paas kai tarah kii shikaayatein aa rahi thim ki unka durupyog ho rahaa he
 The CBI is also investigating several cases of dishonesty in them
 central visilence kamishan (sivisi) ne centre sarkaar se kaha tha ki vah LTC / LTA ke niyamon main badlaav kare
 CVC was also receiving complaints of dishonesty from banks, psus and such institutions
 30 april ko vitt mantralay ne jo vistrut aadesh diya he uske mutabik ab bainkon tathaa sarkari companiyon main LTC ke puraane niyam nahin rahenge, ab un par bhi vahi niyam lagu honge jo centre sarkaar ke karmchaariyon par lagu hote hai
 In government companies, the rules were made very easy, which greatly benefited the employees
 akhbaar ne ek sarkari bank ke emdi ke maamle kaa khulaasa kiya he
 He claimed an LTC of Rs 6 lakh to go from Jaipur to Delhi
 unhone likhaa ki ve dilli brazil ke shahar saao poulo hokar gaye the
 This is possible because there are too many bags in the rules
 ab nae niyamon ke tahat sarkari bainkon or companiyon ke afasar tathaa karmchaaree LTC ke tahat videsh yatra nahin kar sakenge
 They will travel in the same class for which they are authorized
 agar koi apane adhikrut class se neeche ke class main yatra karegaa to use usee ke paise milenge na ki us class ke jiske liye vah adhikrut he
 The newspaper has written that the government has also changed the rules of TA / DA of officers and employees of these institutions
 unke roj ke bhatton par bhi gaaj giri he
 Right now it will be based on their status
 ye sabhi nae niyam 248 sarkari ikaayiyon par bhi lagu honge
 This will not only eliminate dishonesty there but will also reduce operating costs

 com / ylwhhr8qla Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni completely defended Yuvraj Singh, whose 21-ball 11-run stand overshadowed the Indian team's hopes of winning the final match of the ICC World T20
 bharat ko final match main haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa, kyonki srilankai team ne chah wicket se shandaar jeet hasil karke pehali baar isisi vishwa tii20 trophy par kabja kar liya
 With this, the Indian team's dream of becoming the first team to win this tournament twice was shattered
 dhoni ne match ke baad kaha, yuvaraj ke liye yah ek acha din nahin rahaa
 He tried his best, but it was not easy to hit the ball before he got on the ground
 yuvaraj ko lekar kuch sawaalon ko dhoni puri tarah se taal gaye
 This was Dhoni's shortest interaction with the media throughout the tournament
 dhoni ne apni team kii haar ke liye apane ballebaajon ke acchhee shuruyaat ko bade score main tabdeel nahin kar paane or srilanka kii ‘shandaar’ gendbaaji ko mukhya kaaran bataaya
 This is a good gift from the Sri Lankan team for their senior players Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene
 in donon khilaadiyon ne tii20 cricket se sanyas kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Dhoni said after the match ended, in the middle overs our batsmen tried a lot to reach a good score, but we could not succeed in it
 viraat (kohli) hi ekmaatr aise ballebaaj rahe, jo acha score bana paae, lekin shuru main unhen bhi dikkat hui
 The Indian batsmen were able to concede just 19 runs in the last four overs and this hampered their victory
 yadhyapi dhoni ne ise lekar pratidwandvi team ke ballebaajon vishesh rup se srilankai captain lasith malinga kii prashansa kii
 "in the last four overs, he executed his plan brilliantly and proved not to be good for us, but it was good for him," he said
 (lasith) malinga apni gendbaaji se ballebaajon ko pareshaani main daalate rahe
 He also threw the yorker
 yah unke liye badhiya khel sabit hua
 Kohli scored a brilliant 77 while the rest of the batsmen had to struggle a lot to score runs
 dhoni ne kaha, viraat pichley kuch varshon se shandaar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 He is a player who takes good advantage of the opportunity
 acchhee baat yah he ki unke shot se ran aate hai
 Their future is very bright
 petrol-dijal kii aasmaan chooti keemton ke khilaapcongresskebharat bandako vipaksh kii lagbhag 21 partiyon ne samarthan diya
 Except SP-BSP, leaders of other parties also shared the stage with Congress President Shahul Gandhi
 lekin abhi bhi sawaal ye uthta he ki bharat band ke bahaane ekajute hue vipaksh ko rahul kya 2019 ke chunaav tak sadhakar rakh paaenge
 Let me tell you that no political party is seen in this situation in the current politics, who can beat the Narendra Modi led BJP on their own
 yahi vajah he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi, akhilesh yadav, mayawati or mamata banerjee tak vipakshi partiyon ko ekajute hokar modi ke khilaaf chunaav main utarane kii baat kah rahe hai
 But so far the alliance has not taken any form
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko gherne ke liye congress rafel deal ke mudde ko uthaa rahi he
 The Congress and the public were unable to connect directly on the Rafale issue
 aise main petrol-deazal kaa mudda sidhe janata se judaa hua he or maujuuda samay main badi keemton se log pareshaan hai
 In view of this, the Congress saw the hope of political gains, due to which the party announced to take it on the road
 congress ne is mudde ko lekar bharat band kaa elaan kiya or vipakshi dalon se samarthan maanga to koi isse inkaar nahin kar sakaa
 As a result, 21 parties gave their support during Bharat Bandh on Monday
 vahiin, inke zyaadaatar netaa bhi pradarshan main shaamil hue hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party, which is in power in Delhi, has spoken of contesting the Lok Sabha elections alone
 aam aadmi party ne bharat band ko samarthan nahin kiya tha lekin petrol-dijal ke bade daamon ke virodh main shaamil rahi he
 AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh also marched with Congress President Rahul Gandhi on foot and was present on the stage of protest
 jabaki isse pehle tak aam aadmi party congress ke saath manch saajha karne se gurej kar rahi thi
 Sanjay Singh was on foot marching with Rahul Gandhi
 us dauraan ajtak ke reporter ne jab unase poocha ki vipakshi dalon ke netaaon kii tarah virodh pradarshan kaa baij aap nahin laga rakhaa to unhone kaha ki choti-choti baton par dhyaan mat dijie, puraa vipaksh modi sarkaar kii nitiyon ke khilaaf he
 Let me tell you that the opposition which was seen in Parliament during the no-confidence motion against the Modi government was scattered
 vipaksh ke vahi dal hai or usee modi sarkaar ke khilaaf bharat band ke dauraan sadak par ekajute hokar utre the
 The same, SP, BSP and TMC have supported this bandh from outside
 haalanki sapa ne upi main jila or tehsil str par apana alag se pradarshan kiya tha
 On Monday, Rahul Gandhi also appeared on the stage along with Sharad Pawar, Sonia Gandhi, Dr
 Manmohan Singh, Sharad Yadav and Aam Aadmi Party's Sanjay Singh at Ramlila Maidan
 vampanthi dalon ne puure desh main alag se is mudde par dharna-pradarshan kiya tha, isliye vah ramlila maidan kii is raily kaa hissaa nahin liya tha
 The CPM had clearly said that we are with the Congress and the opposition on the issue of oil prices
 haalanki dharna pradarshan kaa faisla bahut pehle se tha
 That is why we could not join the Congress
 bharat band ke bahaane vipaksh kii jo ekajutata, josh or jajba ramlila maidan main dikhaa he
 It will remain till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 isaki koi guarantee nahin he, kyonki vipaksh ke kai aise dal hai jo congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke netritv par raji nahin he
 That is why it is constantly being said that the opposition should unite and defeat Modi and later the leadership will be decided
 surat nagar nigam main kai padon ke liye vaikency nikali he
 Interested candidates can apply till 23 January

 During the hearing on Monday, the Supreme Court rejected all the pleas of Asaram's lawyer
 asaram ke vakil ne kaha ki unhen maamle main jawaab daakhil karne ke liye chaar hafte kaa vakt chahie
 On the other hand, the Rajasthan government said that whatever expenditure has been incurred in bringing Asaram from Jodhpur to Delhi will be borne by Asaram itself
 gauratlab he ki ek janvari ko chekup ke liye asaram ko dilli ke ames laayaa gaya

 The medical report recommends Asaram's surgery at the earliest
 72 varshiya asaram ko sitambar 2013 main giraftaar kiya gaya tha

 sadhvi se yon shoshan ke doshi gurmeet ram rahim ko panchakula se rohtak jail le jane ke liye jis helicopter kaa istemaal kiya gaya use lekar vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 a photo is getting viral on social media claiming that the chopper used to carry Baba is of Gujarat businessman Gautam Adani and before that PM Narendra Modi himself has also traveled in this chopper Huh
 darasal ram rahim ko panchakula se AW-139 helicopter main le jaaya gaya jo ki VIP or kaarobaari logon ke safar ke liye istemaal hota he
 This 15-seat chopper is from Augusta Westland Company
 aisa hi ek choper piem modi ne saal 2014 ke chunaav main prachaar ke liye istemaal kiya tha
 This is the reason that now news is spreading on social media that Ram Rahim was taken in the helicopter that Modi used to travel
 @salmannizami naamak twitor yujar ne twit kiya ki to repist baba ko modi ke pasandida AW139 helicopter se le jaaya gaya, jiske maalik gautam adani hai

 com / jmhktxctfh— Manoj Senapati (@manojsenapati08)august 26, 2017is khabar kaa makasad bijepi, centre sarkaar or khud piem modi ko katghare main khadaa karnaa he kyonki kaarobaari gautam adani ke piem modi ke kareebi hone kaa aarope vipaksh lagaataa rahaa he
 However, this news that is viral is being told only as a rumor and there are arguments in its favor
 afvaah isliye fail rahi he kyonki piem modi or ram rahim donon ke hi helicopter par AW-139 likhaa hua he
 But there are not one or two but dozens of helicopters like AW-139 in India
 khud haryana sarkaar ne bhi saaf kiya he ki ram rahim ko rohtak le jane ke liye jo helicopter istemaal kiya gaya wo ek nijee company se kiraaye par liya gaya tha
 At the same time, the Haryana DGP has also said in a conversation with the media that the fact that the helicopter belongs to Adani's company is not correct but is a lie
 ram rahim ko lekar doosraa vivaad is choper main savaar mahila ko lekar bhi uthaa kyonki kisi kaidi ke saath uske parijanon ko le jane kii anumati nahin hoti
 Later the administration made it clear that the woman in the chopper was Ram Rahim's daughter Honeypreet Insa and she did not stay with him for long
 saath hi adhikariyon ne yah bhi daawa kiya he ki jail main ram rahim ko aam kaidiyon ke tarah hi treetment diya ja rahaa he or unhen kisi bhi tarah kerrif treetment dene kii khabarembebuniyaad he
 However, the administration has kept silence over the question of taking Honeypreet in the chopper
 pregnancy ke dauraan mahilaon ko kai tarah ke shaareerik, hormonal or maansik badlaavon se guzarana padataa he
 It is normal to have vomiting, nausea, dizziness, but women often have anemia due to pregnancy
 pregnancy main khun kii kami maa or bachche donon ke liye hi khatarnaak sabit ho sakati he
 Initial examination reveals anemia
 aise main ise laaparvaahee se lenaa sahi nahin he
 According to a study, in most women in India, the level of hemoglobin is found to be less than normal and hence doctors recommend them to take iron tablets from the second-third month
 iske saath hi unhen diet main aisi chijen bhi shaamil karne ko kaha jaataa he, jisase aayran kii kami puri ho jaae
 Iron deficiency can prove dangerous for both mother and child
 iske saath hi isse bachche ke vikaas par bhi iskaa bura asar padataa he
 While this deficiency is largely overcome by iron tablets, it will also be beneficial to include these essential chi in the diet 
 1
 By drinking beetroot and spinach juice daily, iron deficiency in the body is complete
 agar aapako paalak or chukundar se parhez he to kachche kele kaa istemaal karnaa bhi aapke liye phydemand rahegaa
 2
 rojaanaa paanch se chah khajur khaaen
 This also helps to complete anemia
 iske alaava apni diet main sookhe mewa bhi shaamil karen

 The Congress has been reacting to this matter in a very strict manner
 punjab ke parinaamon par usne aapatti nahin jataai or na hi vahaan par iviem main gadabadi kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Congress has been talking about disturbances in evms in other states
 is maamle kaa congress bahut hi sadhe andaaj main apni pratikriya detii rahi he
 It has not objected to the Punjab results nor accused EVM of disturbances there
 anya rajyon main mili haar par congress iviem main gadabadi kii baat karti rahi he
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee had been confined to the boundary of the house due to ill health since he left office in May 2004, completing his term as India's 12th Prime Minister
 kai varshon tak unki aawaaj tak nahin suni gai—ek aise netaa kii jinhen swatantra bharat ke sabase ojasvi vaktaa ke rup main janaa jaataa ho, isse dukhad or kya hota! iske baavjood vaajapeyi kisi kii smritiyon se leshmaatr bhi ojhal nahin hue
 His legacy is still relevant to both national politics and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 bharat ke purv pradhanmantriyon main jawaharlal nehru or indira gandhi ke baad sabase zyada unhen hi yaad kiya jaataa he
 Dr
, who became Prime Minister after Atal
 manmohan singh 10 varshon tak is pad par rahe
 Narendra Modi, who took office after Manmohan Singh, won a larger parliamentary mandate than Vajpayee
 par modi ne jaan-boojhkar aisi shashan style apanaai jo vaajapeyi ke taur-tareekon se bilkul alag thi—manmohan singh se bhi alag
 Modi's way of governance is very individualistic
 na keval apane mantrimandaleey sahyogiyon ko haashiye par rakhaa gaya he, balki is baat kii koshish hui ki desh ke pehle pradhanmantri nehru samet modi ke sabhi purvavarti pradhanmantriyon ko janamanas kii smriti dhundhala kar diya jaae
 Apart from making his government limited to one person, Modi also wants to make the BJP even limited to one person
 vah party jisaki sthapana vaajapeyi ne 1980 main kii thi
 Vajpayee always kept his presence in the consciousness of the country as a sensitive poet-politician whose popularity was all over the country
 raajnneeti ke pandit kuch samay ke liye khaastaur par modi or vaajapeyi kii bich tulana karnaa jari rakhenge
 Atal remained the most powerful and charismatic leader of the BJP until the disease incapacitated Vajpayee and allowed him to express different points of view on the party's appropriate forums
 darasal, unhone samaj liya tha ki agar bhaajapa kisi bhi netaa yaa nishchit vichaardhaara kii jakad main aa jaati he to vah tarakkee nahin kar sakati
 Even Hindutva, and we all will realize this in the near future
 yahi kaaran he ki bhaajapa kabhi kisi ek netaa ke kabje vaali party nahin ban sakati
 Ideally and organizationally, the BJP is controlled by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 1971 main dwitiya sarasanghachaalak guruji golwalkar ke nidhan ke baad, aresas sabhi staron par samuhik paraamarsh ke siddhant par teji se kaam kar rahaa he
 It will not allow any BJP leader to become the supreme leader of the party and sidelined his hard work of the past as it would loosen his grip on the party
 bhaajapa ek ore to kamobesh aresas dwaara nirdhaarit khaanche main rahegi or duusari ore vaajapeyi dwaara taiyaar us khaanche main jo unhone apane aaajeevan vafaadaar sahyogi laalkrishna adwani ke saath milakar taiyaar kiya he
 Vajpayee did not believe in the ideology of the RSS
 darasal, raajnneeti main unka anubhav jaise-jaise badhata gaya, unhen samaj aane laga ki aresas kaa vishwa drushtikon bahut sankeern he
 Though he admired the discipline and dedication of his volunteers and the Sangh's commitment to make India a strong nation based on a sophisticated and united Hindu society, Vajpayee's vision of nation building did not have a place for extremism
 ek baar ve aresas ke sansthaapak dow
 Keshav Baliram was going to release a book written on Hedgewar
 achaanak unhone yah poochkar mujhe chanka diya, "bharat ke swadhinata andolan main dow
 What was Hedgewar's contribution? ”I thought that he probably did not consider Hedgewar to be a major contributor
 phir bhi, vaajapeyi ne yah bhi mahasoos kiya ki bhaajapa aresas se alag nahin ho sakati he
 During his tenure as Prime Minister, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Swadeshi Jagran Manch criticized him many times
 vaajapeyi kii mushkilen badhaane ke liye 2001 main viechpi ne ayodhya andolan ko phir se hawa deni shuru kii
 He demanded that by December 6, 1992, where the Babri Masjid stood and the idols were installed by the kar sevaks to demolish it, 67 acres of the land of the disputed site should be given to him immediately, to pave the way for the construction of Ram temple there
 maine ek baar unase poocha ki unki sarkaar ko kamjor karne ke viechpi ke prayaason par ve sakht ravaiya kyon nahin apana rahe
 His reply was, "if we decide to clash with the VHP, the BJP will break
 '' vaajapeyi ne is tarah sangh parivaar ke khaanche ke bheetar bhi swayan or apni party, donon ke liye ek swadhin sthaan taiyaar karne kii koshish kii
 Some may even call it his weakness but he was realistic and practical in politics
 bharat ke loktantr, isaki vividhta ke prati sakvamaan, dharmanirpekshata kii avadharana or vikaas ke prati apni patibaddhta ko unhone kabhi kam nahin hone diya
 These were the four defining characteristics of his politics
 ye chaaron bharat ke liye hameshaa praasangik rahenge or kisi bhi netaa yaa sanghathan dwaara unhen kamjor karne kaa koi bhi prayaas aatmghaatee siddh hoga
 From the party's affairs to the national political scenario, Vajpayee was also highly democratic
 gujarat main bade paimaane par hui sampradayik hinsa ke baad vaajapeyi gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke rup main modi kaa istipha chaahate the
 But in view of Advani and the majority opinion of bjp's national executive in the 2002 Goa session, he backed down
 jorge furnandis or jaswant singh kii madad se unhone or adwani ne rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) banaaya tha
 Many parties involved in it were previously outspoken opponents of the BJP
 phir bhi, ve agar bhaajapa ke saath khadey hue to yah vaajapeyi ke prati un dalon ke vishwaas ke kaaran sambhav hua
 Vajpayee's NDA was the first successful alliance in the country's history
 unhone endie ko ek aise siyaasi manch ke rup main mana jo kshetreey bhaawanaaon or gaurav ke saath ek sudrudh bharat kii soch ke saath chalata tha
 He did not let the bjp's agenda be imposed on the NDA (especially its three major issues — the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the Uniform Civil Code and the repeal of Article 370 of the Constitution that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir within the Indian Union)
 unhone gathbandhan ko ekajute rakhane ke liye "gathbandhan dharm'' shabd diya
 He also followed what he said
 unke netritv or bharat ko vikaas ke raste par sarapat daudane ke unke drudh sankalp kii vipaksh ne bhi prashansa kii
 For instance, Vajpayee once called a meeting of chief ministers on power sector reforms
 lekin logon kii raay thi ki centre main bhaajapa kii aguai vaali sarkaar vipakshi dalon, khaastaur se congress shasit rajyon ko manaane main sakasham nahin hogi
 Nevertheless, Congress leader Digvijay Singh, who was the then Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, said in the meeting: “atalji, please introduce these difficult reforms
 ham aapkaa samarthan karte hai or ham yah bhi jaanate hai ki sirf aap hi aisa kar sakate hai
 Vajpayee received respect from the opposition parties, as he himself showed respect to the opposition parties and leaders
 ve aksar kehete the ki loktantr sirf sankhyaon kaa ek khel bhar nahin he, jisamen 51 fisadi log sochen ki unhen 49 fisadi logon kii andekhi karne kaa adhikaar he
 It calls for a democratic mindset
 ashishnutaa or ahankaar kii jagah sahansheeltaa, vinamrata or bhinn drushtikon vaale logon ke saath bhi kaam karne kii ichha honi chahie
 Indian politics will never become a two-party system, nor will it ever embrace a party system of communist-ruled China
 isliye, vaajapeyi ke siddhant or gathbandhan shashan kaa tarika hameshaa praasangik rahegaa
 In the Indian context, respect for democracy and diversity is more closely linked, and Vajpayee understood this better than most leaders of his era
 dusron par purna prabhutv sthapit karne main koi samudaay, sanghathan yaa vichaardhaara kabhi safal nahin ho sakati he
 Vajpayee knew this
 so, unhone maujuuda bhaajapa netaaon dwaara "congress-mukt bharat'' banane kii ahamkaari or adoordarshee baat kii anumati kabhi nahin di hoti
 Vajpayee's belief in secularism was a natural consequence of his belief in democracy and diversity
 yah dharmanirpekshata kaa congressi brands nahin tha, jisamen jaan-boojhkar yaa anjaane main muslimon ko vot bank ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 It was also not a communist brand of secularism which deliberately seeks to tarnish the Hindu image of India
 congress or vamapanthiyon ne bhaajapa par "sampradayik party'' bataate hue jitna hamalaa bolaa, utana hi ve bhaajapa ko apane paksh main hinduon ko golband karne main madad karte gaye
 Vajpayee never shied away from accepting his Hindu characteristics
 unki ek shuruaati kavita jo aaj bhi bhaajapa-sangh samarthakon main bahut lokapriy he isaki sweekaarokti he
 His lines are like, "hindu body, mind, Hindu life, rig-rig Hindu introduce me
" ''phir bhi, kisi bhi sachche hindu kii tarah, ve kabhi bhi muslim yaa islam virdohi nahin rahe
 His long experience in politics further strengthened his belief that India could not abandon its commitment to secularism
 jab 1980 main bhaajapa kii sthapana hui, to unhone yah sunishchit kiya ki "sakaaratmak dharmanirpekshata'' ko party apni mul vichaardhaaratmak patibaddhtaon main se ek ke rup main shaamil kare
 The party interpreted this commitment as "justice for all, appeasement of none"
 yah alag baat he ki vaajapeyi ne 1980 main janata party kii viraasat ke vaastavik uttaradhikari ke rup main bhaajapa ke liye jo raah tay kii thi, vah us par kaayam nahin rah saki
 After the humiliating defeat in the 1984 parliamentary elections after the assassination of Indira Gandhi in which Vajpayee had to face defeat, the BJP raised the issue of construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya for its resurgence
 vaajapeyi dil se kabhi nahin chaahate the ki ayodhya andolan main party bhaag le lekin unke sabake nirnay ke aage jhukna padaa
 However, when the BJP felt that the Ayodhya issue would not bring it to power, it again turned to Vajpayee's brand of inclusive politics
 yah aresas or viechpi ke kattarpanthi kheme ko pasand nahin tha
 Therefore, when Vajpayee failed to bring the NDA back to power in 2004, the camp insisted that the BJP must return to its Hindutva agenda
 bhaajapa kii haar ne unhen udhaas kar diya tha kyonki shashan ke apane agenda se jude kai kaam—vishesh rup se, pakistan ke saath sambandhon ko saamaanya banane ke unke lagaataar prayaas—adhure rah gaye the
 He was equally saddened that many voices from within the Sangh Parivar were blaming Vajpayee for abandoning the Hindutva agenda behind this defeat
 mujhe chunavi haar ke kaarnon par vichaar-vimarsh ke liye agast 2004 main goa main yojit ek "chintan shivi'' yaad he
 The issue of Hindutva came up for discussion, but Atalji avoided interfering in it
 tii brake ke dauraan, jab main unke saath akele baitha tha
 He remained silent for a long time, then suddenly one of his questions shook me completely
 unhone poocha, "yah hindutv kya hota he?'' is prashn main hi uttar chupa tha—vaajapeyi hindutv main vishwaas nahin karte the—yaa kam se kam hindutv kii us vyakhya main to katai nahin, jo aresas-viechpi main unke aalochakon ne di thi
 He had his own way of saying that India can give good governance to every section of its diverse society
 vaajapeyi kii sabase badi uplabdhi suraksha or videshi niti ke kshetra main rahi
 He made sincere efforts to normalize relations with Pakistan and China
 ve samajhate the ki agar bharat ko tarakkee kii raftaar tej kerani he to use in do ahm padosiyon ke saath viraasat main mili vivaadon kaa nipataara karnaa hi hoga
 Despite his betrayal in Kargil in 1991, his efforts to negotiate with Pakistan reflected a visionary politician
 vaajapeyi ne janata party sarkaar (1977-79) main videsh mantri ke rup main 1962 ke yuddh ke baad bharat-china sambandhon ko behaal karne kii disha main pehali safalataa hasil kii thi
 When Vajpayee became Prime Minister, he took a bold step like bringing the border dispute to the center of the india-china official dialogue
 2003 main beijing kii apni yatra ke dauraan, unhone or chini netritv ne seemaa vivaad par baatcheet ke liye donon deshon ke vishesh pratinidhiyon ke bich baatcheet kaa ek masauda taiyaar karne kaa faisla kiya
 His trusted national security adviser Brajesh Mishra and China's senior vice president Dai Bingguo took the talks in the right direction
 bingguo ne apane sansmaranon main ullekh kiya he ki yadi vaajapeyi phir se satta main aate to seemaa vivaad ko nipataane ko lekar behatar sarvasammati ban sakati thi
 An era in Indian politics came to an end with the death of Vajpayee
 (sudhindra kulkarni 1998 se 2004 ke dauraan pradhanmantri karyaalay main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke sahyogi the)*** Andhra Pradesh Assembly Speaker Kiran Kumar Reddy rejected the resignation of 129 mlas given the demand for formation of a separate Telangana state
 reddy ne kaha ki telugana mudde par unhen 222 sadasyon ke istife praapt hue the
 However, 92 of them resigned, while 130 were pending with them, out of which 129 have been rejected
 vidhansabhadhyaksh ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘maine khud har tyaagptr kaa pareekshan kiya or unke liye nirdhaarit sanvaidhanik niyamon par baariki se najar daali
 i will call and talk to the MLA related to the resignation letter pending with me
 ’’ reddy ne us vidhayak kaa naam bataane se inkaar kar diya, jiskaa tyaagptr unke paas lambit he
 They said that they have been trying to contact that MLA since morning, but they have not been able to talk to him
 reddy ne rajya main jari andolan par chintaa jaahir karte hue kaha ki rajya main kam se kam 50 lakh chaatr-chaatraon ko vibhinn parikshaon main shaamil hona he or ve apana saal barbaad nahin kar sakate
 He also indicated that due to political instability, the state may have to hold assembly elections again, which will cost the exchequer Rs 100 crore
 bihar police kii vishesh shakha ke tatkaaleen espi rajeev ranjan ne loksabhaa chunaav ke kuch din baad apane vibhaag ke dspi se aresas ke 19 sanghathanon ke netaaon or padaadhikariyon ke bare main report maangi thi
 The matter opened up after the media got involved and Nitish Kumar came on the defensive

 After this dispute, it is believed that this will increase the feeling of mistrust between Nitish and the Sangh

 janata dal united ke ravivaar ko yojit chuda-dahi ke bhoj se congress khud ko alag rakhegi
 The Congress is unhappy to invite the leaders of Bihar Bharatiya Janata Party to this banquet
 haalanki aadhikarik rup se congress ke netaa philhal kuch nahin bol rahe lekin bihar congress ke adhyaksh ashok choudhary kaa kahana he ki bihar janata dal ke adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh jaanate hai ki aakhir bijepi ko kyon is saal bulaayaa gaya
 And it is their right to call whom, but the party is certainly not happy with this decision
 haalanki janata dal united ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki congress thodi jaldbaaji dikhaa rahi he, kyonki na keval bijepi balki vampanthi dalon ke netaaon ko bhi nimantrit kiya gaya he
 Lalu Yadav had also invited BJP leaders, but the Congress leaders did not react sharply to him
 yah alag baat he ki bihar bijepi ke netaaon ne lalu yadav ke chuda-dahi ke bhoj kaa yah kahkar nimantran thukraa diya ki lalu yadav ne khud unhen nimantrit nahin kiya balki apane sahyogiyon se phone karavaaya
 Bihar BJP leader Sushil Modi on Sunday confirmed his visit to the Janata Dal United banquet, saying that he had old relations with Nitish Kumar
 yah bhi padhein- dahi-chuda raajnneeti! makar sankranti par nitish kumaar ke bhoj main bijepi netaa aamantrittippaniyan The leader of Janata Dal United says that Lalu Yadav has started calling his opponents and his party is just carrying on this good tradition
 haalanki shanivaar ko lalu yadav dwaara yojit bhoj main bijepi ke netaaon ke alaava mahagathbandhan ke sabhi netaa maujuud the
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar arrived at Lalu Yadav's house after returning to Patna after attending the closing ceremony of the Kal Chakra Festival in Bodh Gaya
 vahiin bijepi ke netaa, party ke vidhayak rajnish kumaar singh ke ghar par bhoj main jute
 After the announcement of the Congress, all eyes will now be on the Janata Dal United Sunday dinner
 sawaal he ki kya congress ke mantri hi isse apane aapako alag rakhenge? party ke vidhayak bhaag lenge yaa nahin? jo bhi ho, lekin nishchit rup se bihar main makar sankranti kaa bhoj bhi is baat kaa suchakank banataa ja rahaa he ki rajya kii raajnneeti kis karavat baith rahi he
 Although officially the Congress leaders are not speaking at the moment, Bihar Congress President Ashok Chaudhary says that Bihar Janata Dal President Vashisht Narayan Singh knows why the BJP was called this year
 or yah unka adhikaar he ki ve kise bulaaen, lekin party is nirnay se nishchit rup se khush nahin he
 However, the leaders of Janata Dal United say that the Congress is showing a little haste, because not only the BJP but also the leaders of the Left parties have been invited
 nimantrit to lalu yadav ne bhi bijepi netaaon ko kiya tha, lekin congress ke netaaon ne us par koi tikhi pratikriya nahin di
 It is a different matter that the leaders of Bihar BJP turned down the invitation of Lalu Yadav's chuda-dahi banquet, saying that Lalu Yadav did not invite him but got a call from his colleagues
 bihar bijepi ke netaa susheel modi ne ravivaar ko janata dal united ke bhoj main jane kii pushti karte hue kaha he ki nitish kumaar ke saath un logon ke puraane sambandh rahe hai
 Also read- dahi-chuda politics! BJP leader invited comments on Nitish Kumar's banquet on Makar Sankranti janata dal united ke netaa kehete hai ki apane virodhiyon ko bulaane kii shuruyaat lalu yadav ne kii he or unki party bas is acchhee parampara ko aage badha rahi he
 However, besides the BJP leaders, all the leaders of the grand alliance were present at the banquet hosted by Lalu Yadav on Saturday
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bodh gaya main kaal chakra festival ke samaapan samaaroh main bhaag lene ke baad patna waapas aane ke baad lalu yadav ke ghar pahunche
 At the same time, the leader of BJP, attended a banquet at the house of party MLA Rajnish Kumar Singh
 congress kii ghoshnaa ke baad ab sabaki nigahen janata dal united ke ravivaar ke bhoj par rahegi
 The question is, will Congress ministers keep themselves apart from this? Will party mlas participate or not? Whatever it is, but of course the banquet of Makar Sankranti in Bihar is also becoming an index of how the politics of the state is turning
 haalanki janata dal united ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki congress thodi jaldbaaji dikhaa rahi he, kyonki na keval bijepi balki vampanthi dalon ke netaaon ko bhi nimantrit kiya gaya he

 Suresh Kalmadi, President of the Indian Olympic Association, broke the heart of Havildar Ramsingh Yadav in the army four years ago
 kalmadi ne pehle galati se elaan kar diya ki uttar pradesh main janme 29 saal ke yadav ne beijing olympic 2008 ke liye qualiphi kar liya he
 Yadav completed the Mumbai Marathon in 2 hours 18 minutes and 23 seconds
 kuch ek ghanton baad hi kalmari ne 'galati' sudhaarte hue bataaya ki yadav teen second se chook gaye the
 25 January 2012: See India Today in pictures, the 5 foot 8 inch Yadav stationed at the Artillery Center in Hyderabad finally staked his claim for the Olympics on January 15 with his hard work and dedication
 is baar unhone mumbai marathon ko 2 ghanta 16 minute or 59 second main puraa kiya, jo landan olympic ke international association of athlettic sangh ke tay kiye gaye 'bi' shrenee ke paimaane ke bheetar he
 Tears of happiness rose in his eyes as he reached the final point of the marathon race
 unki kamyaabi par darshak tali baja rahe the, lekin unki nazren apane prashikshak di

 11 January 2012: In the photographs, a runner within the India Today 'B' category is allowed to participate in the Olympics from that country if he completes the race in the domestic tournament in minimum time
 is saal july se pehle agar koi dhaavak kisi manyata praapt gharelu toornament main niyat samay se kam samay main daud kaa daawa pesh karata he, to yadav ke sapanom par pani phir saktaa he
 At the moment, the record is in his favor
 pichley 36 saal main koi bhi bhartiya dhaavak 2 ghanta 16 minute or 59 second se kam avadhi main daud puri nahin kar sakaa he
 04 January 2012: See India Today in pictures The strict training of running 120 to 150 km daily for six to eight hours at Army Sports Institute, Pune has brought Yadav closer to his dream for the last eight years 
 2007, 2008 or 2009 main unhone mumbai marathon jeet kar hetric banaai
 He finished second in 2010 and third in 2011

 On the one hand, the Indian government is saying that it has not made any deal with China, but has diplomatically forced it to withdraw from the border of Ladakh
 lekin ab deal kaa asar dikhne laga he or bhartiya sena ne samrik drushti se mahatvapoornchumar postse apane bunker hataane shuru kar die hai
 It is being told that according to the agreement reached in the flag meeting between the two countries, the Indian Army is breaking its bunker from the Chumar post in Ladakh
 isse pehle videsh mantrisalman khurshidane kaha tha ki china ke saath atikaraman masale ko bina kisi deal ke hal kiya gaya he
 But now the way the Indian Army is breaking its bunker, questions are being raised on Khurshid's claims
 chumaar post lekar mana chinapichley hafte jab yah khabar ai ki chini sena ladakh main bhartiya jameen se peeche hat gai he to kisi ko yakeen nahin hua
 Everyone was wondering how India convinced China to retreat without showing any strictness
 lekin baad main pataa chalaa ki china ne aise hi apni jid nahin chodi, balki use raji karne main bharat ko samrik drushti se ahm chumaar post hataane par raji hona padaa
 It is very important that the Chumar post sources say that the Chinese army agreed to withdraw from Ladakh on the condition that India will remove its post from Chumar
 darasal, purvi ladakh ke chumaar post se bhartiya fouj chini haive kii gatividhiyon par najar rakhti hai
 China has long been demanding the removal of Chumar's forward observation post from India
 jeet kii keemtsaaf he ki sarkaar jise kootnithik jeet qaraar de rahi he, uski badi keemat chukaai gai he
 On the other hand, leaders like Samajwadi Party Mulayam Singh Yadav, who had seen the war of 1962, are still not ready to trust China
 unhone kaha tha, 'china par bharosa mat kiijie
 He has seen everything

 ' shiv ko bholenath kehete hai
 Because Shiva is the God of simplicity
 unhen kaccha fal pasand he
 Shiva becomes happy even with a lotta water
 khaastaur se agar aap apni jindagi se niraash yaa hataash hai to aapako shiv kii puja jarur kerani chahie
 But the sooner Bholenath becomes happy, the sooner he becomes angry
 khaastaur se aise logon se, jo beyimaani or dhokhebaaji karte hai
 Goddess Parvati's anger According to Parvind Mishra, the seventh sky, Lord Shiva listens to the mind of every person
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki aaj 21veen sadi main shiv kii puja sabase zyada log karte hai
 Shiv ji is quite popular especially among the youth
 lekin bhagwaan shiv jitani jaldi prasann hote hai, unka gussa usase bhi pralayankari he
 Pandit Praveen Mishra said that Shiva Purana describes some sins committed by action, behavior and thinking, which Lord Shiva never forgives
 aisa vyakti hameshaa hi shiv ke coup kaa bhaajan hoga or kabhi bhi sukhi jivan vyateet nahin kar saktaa
 These are 15 unique temples of Hanumanji
 
 
 aapane suna hoga ki uuparavaale se kuch chupa nahin hota
 Even what you are thinking in your mind is not hidden from God
 isliye bhale hi baat or vyavhaar main aapane kisi ko nuksaan naa pahunchaaya ho, lekin agar man main kisi ke prati koi durbhaavna he yaa aapane kisi kaa ahit sochaa ho, to yah bhi paap kii shrenee main aata he
 1
 shaadi todane kii kashishbhagwan shiv ko aise log bilkul pasand nahin hai, jo apane rishte main eemaandaaree nahin rakhte
 In particular, Bholenath is annoyed by trying to break someone else's married life and does not forgive this sin
 duusare ke pati yaa patni par buree najar rakhana yaa use paane kii ichha karnaa bhi paap kii shrenee main aata he
 2
 paison kii dhokhebaajidusron kaa dhan apana banane kii chaah rakhana, paison kii herapheri karnaa or dhan-sampatti lootnaa bhi paap kii shrenee main aata he
 It is an unforgivable crime for Lord Shiva
 3
 To give trouble, to trouble a innocent and innocent person, to harm him or to plan to create obstacles for him or to keep thinking like this is an unforgivable sin in the eyes of Lord Shiva
 4
 Adopting the wrong path Some people lose their way, but after getting the right instructions, they come back to the right path
 par kuch log aise bhi hote hai jo sahi suzav milane ke baavjood buraai kaa saath nahin chhodte or buree raah ko khud chunate hai
 The sins of such people are unforgivable
 hanumanji kii puja se shant rahete hai shanidev
 
 
 5
 buree sochshiv puraana ke anusaar jis prakaar aap kisi kaa bura nahin karne ke baavjood, uske liye buree soch rakhane ke kaaran bhi paap ke hakdaar or dand kii shrenee main aa jate hai, usee prakaar bhale hi aapane apane kaary se kisi kaa bura naa kiya ho, lekin aapaki boli akshamya paapon kaa hakdaar bhi bana sakati he
 6
 garbhvatee mahila ko kuvachankisi garbhvatee mahila yaa masik ke dauraan kisi mahila ko katu vachan kahana yaa apni baton se unka dil dukhaana shiv kii najaron main akshamya aparaadh or paap he
 You will be unaware of these 10 things of Pawanputra Hanuman
 
 
 7
 Lying to harm: Lying with the intention of damaging someone's honor falls into the category of 'deceit' and makes one a participant in unforgivable sin
 8
 Spreading rumor In the society, it is also an unforgivable sin to intention to harm one's honor or to talk back or to spread rumors

 Actually, we were brought to the Tibetan Medical System Hospital in Zedang, Shannon Prefecture, to learn about Tibetan medicine
 yah aspataal aam aspataalon jaisaa nahin he
 Very clean and equipped with the history of what the ancestors did for this medical system
 aspataal ke get par hi paaramparik tareeke se swaagat ke baad sabase pehle hamen ek vishalkay haul main le jaaya gaya
 There were no charts in this hall, telling about the human body structure and diseases, but also a thing has been told through fan paintings
 sardi, khaansee, zukam, ghutane kaa dard, kamjor dil yaa fefde, pet main bachche kaa vikaas sab kuch he in par
 One of these paintings which explains in detail the structure inside the human body is about twelve hundred years old
 zaraa sochie kitna vaqt, kitni mehnat lagi hogi, ek-ek cheez jaanane samajhane main, kya-kya karnaa padaa hoga or ye sab jaanane ke baavjood kitni kushalta chahie hogi ilaaj karne ke liye
 At that time there were no modern machines to tell the inside
 baaki tankha paintings jo yahaan lagi hai, vah sab ausatan 600 saal puraani hai
 The special thing of Tibetan medicine is that medicines are made mostly from flora, roots, deer horn, etc
 is haul main in vanaspatiyon ke bhi sample martabaanon main rakhe gaye hai
 By the way, the doctors here say that there is some effect on Tibetan medical practice from neighboring countries like India, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar
 is aspataal main ve sabhi kapade or kaagaj par likhi pandulipiyaan bhi hai, jin par pehle ke vakt main kiya hua research darj he or ek or chiz jo aapane pehle kabhi nahin dekhi hogi - tibeti chikitsa paddati ke jitne mahaan doctor hue hai, sabaki choti-choti murtiyon yahaan ek kamare main lagi hai
 i started thinking what if we have such idols to be installed here
 vaise, doctor tashi hamen bataate hai ki ab yah ek aadhunik aspataal ho chukaa he
 There are 300 beds here
 yahaan pichley saal ilaaj ke liye ek lakh marij aae the, lekin nabbe fisadi ne tibeti ilaaj hi karaayaa
 What trust par jab hamane poocha ki tarika kya baakiyon jaisaa he yaa kuch alag bhi he to pataa chalaa ki naadee subah jaagane ke saath janchi jaati he yaa jab aap kam se kam aadha ghanta sthir baithe hon, kabhi bhi nahin
 Whatever part of the body is suffering, it is counted and observed, routine is asked
 mere sahyogi umashankar singh ne turant yah jaananaa chaha ki kya vajan ghataane kaa koi short cat he to jawaab mila ki uske liye to mehnat kerani hi padegi or haa agar aap soch rahe hon ki bada aasaan he is paddati kaa doctor bananaa to aisa nahin he
 For this, one has to study for five to six years
 yah paddati tibet main itani maani jaati he ki chini sarkaar ne na sirf yahaan ke aspataal main nae wing sponcer kiye hai, balki shainan sarkaar kii madad se tibeti paddati kaa aspataal beijing main bhi khol diya he
 The popularity of these medicines is such that there are also two factories for making them, one in Italy and the other in Switzerland and a separate department has been set up for research on this in Harvard

 Evening in the presence of party leaders Ananth Kumar, Dharmendra Pradhan, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Shahnawaz Hussain and Rajiv Pratap Rudy for the BJP state president at the Bihar state office at Legislative Councilor Virchand Patel Marg amidst the uproar of outgoing state president CP Thakur supporters
 i filed my nomination
 namakan patr kii jaanch ke baad naye pradesh adhyaksh kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa shuukravaar ko kii jaaegi
 By giving Pandey a chance, the bjp's central leadership has once again reposed faith in youth power and put an end to the tumult of the past few months
 thakur samarthak bijepi vidhayak avanish kumaar singh or kuch anya netaa kendriya netritv ke faisle kaa virodh kar rahe the lekin guuruuvaar ko swayan susheel kumaar modi dwaara vikshubdhon ke manaane par virodh shant ho gaya
 Election officer and former Mayor of Delhi Municipal Corporation Aarti Mehra said that 44-year-old Mangal Pandey filed nomination in seven sets in which 107 proposers including Modi supported him
 isse pehle vikshubdh gut ke samarthakon ne bijepi ke kendriya mahasachiv tathaa bihar maamalon ke party ke prabharee anant kumaar or sah prabharee dharmendra pradhan ke patna airport par pahunchane par kendriya netritv ke khilaaf narebaaji kii
 Disturbed activists were angry with the central leadership for approving Mangal Pandey's candidature
 pandeya ke namakan kaa safar aasaan nahin rahaa
 The bjp's JD (U) alliance may be seen to add to the apprehensive threat after the removal of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar from the NDA in the event of the bjp's new state president's election being presented as the prime ministerial candidate to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 Used to be
 thakur sambhavat: kendriya netritv ke nirnay se aprasann hai
 He was not present at the party's state office at the time of nomination
 party sutron ne bataaya ki thakur ne kendriya netaaon anant kumaar or dharmendra pradhan se bhi milane se inkaar kar diya
 Party people wanted to meet Thakur and talk to him
 thakur ne saaf inkaar kar diya
 Pandey's election is seen as a victory for Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who had formed the BJP-JD (U) alliance in Bihar
 modi ko nitish kumaar ke vichaaron kaa jagah jagah par samarthan karne vaale netaa ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The seven-year-old alliance of BJP and JDU was going through a turmoil recently by CP Thakur's statement in support of Narendra Modi
 modi ko pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar ke rup main thakur ne samarthan kiya tha
 However, Nitish Kumar has expressed his dislike for Narendra Modi from time to time as nda's prime ministerial candidate
 phir bhi thakur ne haal main kai baar narendra modi ko pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar ke rup main sahi tehraaya tha
 Pandey is considered a candidate for Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi's camp
 mangal pandeya ke naam par kendriya netritv se muhar lagaakar upmukhyamantri ne ekbar phir rajya main apni pakad sabit kii he
 Modi again succeeded in getting his colleague's name stamped
 bijepi ke ek naaraaz vidhayak avanish kumaar singh ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha tha ki vah kendriya netritv ke thope gayi ummidavaar ke khilaaf apana namakan karenge
 Singh's attitude looked soft on Sushil Kumar Modi's persuasion
 naaraaz chal rahe nitish sarkaar main bijepi cote ke mantri chandramohan raay ne kaha ki vah kendriya netritv ke nirnay ko maanenge
 However, he has been successful in presenting his views before the central leadership about what the state BJP president should be like
 thakur gut ke naaraaz bijepi kaaryakartaaon ko samajha bujhaakar shant karaane main party netritv ko kaaphi mashkkat kerani padi
 Animal and Fisheries Resources Minister Giriraj Singh at Patna Airport pacified the sloganeering party workers
 aisa samajha ja rahaa he ki beete 10 janvari ko dilli main hi mangal pandeya ke naam par bhaajapa alaakaman ne muhar laga di thi
 Pandey's name was decided in a meeting chaired by the party's national president Nitin Gadkari

 in / a 14-year-old minor girl became a mother in a madrasa in Kanker, Chhattisgarh
 usne madrase main hi ek ladki ko janm diya or use laavaaris sthaan main chhod ai
 One day the girl kept crying, some passerby informed the unclaimed girl to the police
 maukey par pahunchi police ne pehle to navjaat bacchee ko aspataal main daakhil karaayaa or phir uske maa-baap kii khojbin main jute gayi
 After questioning, the police turned to a madrasa in the area
 aakhirkaar madrase main padhane vaali ek ladki ko apane kabje main lekar use bhi aspataal main daakhil karaayaa
 Police have registered a crime of rape and sexual exploitation on the son of a madrasa operator
 haalanki maamla darj hone ke baad aaropee faraar ho gaya
 Both the mother and child were knocked out in the madrasa of Kukanker by the police and the workers who worked there were blown away
 maamla bhi kuch aisa hi tha
 In the initial investigation, people present in the seminary protested against the intervention of the police
 lekin maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue police ne tamaam logon kii bolti band kar di
 After some time, when the police identified some of the girls studying in the madrasa, the mother of that abandoned girl came in front
 police ne use tatkaal aspataal main daakhil karaayaa
 At the moment both babies are fine
 peedit ladki gaiyr shaadishuda he or wo is madrase main dini talim lene ke liye ai thi
 But she came under the guise of the son of the madrasa operator
 peedita ko milti raheen dhamkiyanis ladki ke mutabik mohammad ali farrukh kaa betaa aabaad farrukh uskaa saal bhar se shoshan kar rahaa tha
 He had told his victim to his relatives, but by then it was too late
 lihaaja peedit ladki ne surakshit prasav ke liye kanker ke madrase kii sharan lee
 The girl also lodged a complaint with the police that Abad Farooq was constantly threatening to kill her, so she kept silence and at her behest, left her child in a deserted area in an abandoned situation
 or bhi ladakiyon ke saath yon shoshan kaa aropapulice maamle kii padtaal main juty he
 The victim girl had entered a madrasa named gulshan-e-jahra in Sanjay Nagar in Kanker two months ago
 iske pehle wo raipur main mohammad ali farrukh ke madrase main rah rahi thi
 He continued to be sexually abused here
 yahmadrasaraipur main baijnathpara ilaake main sthit he
 The girl remained pregnant for the entire nine months, but neither the workers of the madrasa of Raipur helped her nor did the people of Kanker
 yahi nahin donon hi madrase ke sanchaalak isanaballighladki ke garbhvatee hone ke maamle ko chhipate rahe
 The police is also investigating why the madrasa workers did not tell such a big thing to the police nor to the prominent people of the society
 madrase main daakhil hone ke baad yah bhi baat saamne ai ki aaropee aabaad farrukh or bhi kai ladakiyon par yon sambandh sthapit karne ke liye dabaav daalata rahaa
 While he is married and also the father of three children
 police ab raipur or kanker donon hi ilaakon ke madrason main padhane vaali ladakiyon or unke parijanon se jaankariyaan ikatthi kar rahi he
 So that a list of more black exploits of the accused can be prepared
 police ne peedit naaballig ladki ke parijanon ke bayaan bhi darj kiye hai
 Encouraged by the victories in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana Lok Sabha by-elections, the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Rashtriya Lok Dal decided to fight the Lok Sabha elections 2019 battle together
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke nattejey aae to uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa or ralod mahagathbandhan ke haath kuch khaas nahin laga
 Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav are seen breaking up in UP 11 days after the election defeat
 kyonki chunaav parinaam kii samiksha baithak main basapa pramukh mayawati ne aarope lagaaya ki gathbandhan se unki party ko phaayde kii jo ummid thi, wo puri nahin hui, lihaaja gathbandhan kii samiksha kii ja rahi he
 The question is, during the Lok Sabha elections, what the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was claiming to break the alliance of these parties, will it finally come true? At the moment, Mayawati has also announced to break the alliance with Akhilesh, declaring to go to the assembly by-election
 sawaal yah bhi he ki chunaav prachaar ke dauraan akhilesh yadav ne jis gathbandhan ko atoot bataaya tha, vah keval loksabhaa chunaav tak hi simit tha?loksabhaa chunaav main haar kii samiksha ke liye dilli main hui baithak main mayawati ne kuch badi baaten kahin jise gathbandhan ke liye khatre kii ghanti ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Mayawati says that neither the Yadavs' vote was transferred nor the Jats in the election
 unhone kaha ki akhilesh apni patni or bhai ko bhi nahin jeeta paae
 Shivpal Yadav lost votes
 unhone bijepi ko vot transfar karwaae or akhilesh ise roak nahin paae
 Now to raise the party afresh, Mayawati has announced to dissolve several committees of the party
 kya sapa-basapa kii raahen hongi judaayahi nahin, ab tak upachunaav se basapa ko baahar rakhane vaaleen mayawati ne upi kii 11 vidhansabha siton par ladane kaa elaan kar diya he
 BSP MLA Sukhdev Rajbhar says that big leaders will tell whether the alliance will stay or go
 gauratlab he ki loksabhaa chunaav main basapa 38, sapa 37 or ralod 3 siton par milakar chunaav ladi thim
 But the BSP won only 10 seats and the Samajwadi Party got five seats
 vahiin ralod kaa khaataa tak nahin khulaa
 Here, in Delhi, Mayawati was hinting at breaking the alliance and Akhilesh in Azamgarh thanked the voters for the victory
 chunaav ke baad pehle saarvajanik bayaan main akhilesh ne sweekaar kiya wo ladaai samaj nahin paae
 The fight was on absconding and cycling
 a journalist says that this fight was on absconding and cycling

 shivasena ne narendra modi par ek nayaa tir choda he
 Criticizing Modi's speech, Uddhav Thackeray has satirized in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana' that the way he criticizes the Prime Minister, it seems that all situations will improve once he comes to power
 laalkrishna adwani kaa hawala dete hue 'saamana' main likhaa gaya he ki swatantraaa diwas ke din waisi aalochana se bachaa janaa chahie tha
 Uddhav Thackeray wrote, 'modi has been mired in controversies over the criticism of PM
 haalanki manmohan singh es shakhsiyat hai jinaki aalochana honi chahie lekin adwani ji khud kah chuke hai ki swatantraaa diwas ke din aisi aalochanaon se bachaa janaa chahie tha
 'it was further written in Saamana,' Modi mocked the Prime Minister
 modi ne kaha ki agar gujarat or dilli main res ho to gujarat jitegaa
 But it is interesting what the Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh say on this
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki modi ke raaj main gujarat kaa vikaas hua he
 But when it comes to race in Delhi, it is not always that only the front runners win
 'uddhav ke mutabik, 'aakraamak style manmohan singh ko suut nahin karti he or modi sidhe bhaawanaaon par prahaar karte hai
 But Advani himself has questioned that whether it was right to attack PM in this way on the occasion of Independence Day
 adwani deshbhakt hone ke saath anbhavi bhi hai
 BJP has reached here on their own today
 adwani hameshaa se neshnal politics main lipt rahe hai, isliye unka apana neshnal najariya bhi he
 "uddhav compared Modi to HD Deve Gowda," Modi is also thinking about the throne of Delhi in the way Deve Gowda became the Prime Minister directly from the Chief Minister
 lekin ye unka andruni maamla he
 Modi has sparked against the Congress
 lekin kai baar chingaari lagane vaala khud hi jal jaataa he
 Modi himself is sensible, he does not need advice
 hindutv ke ghode par savaar hokar modi lalakile par najar gadaaye hue hai
 'uddhav said,' Modi's speech made Pakistan sleepy or not that Hafiz Saeed only knows, but we have heard that Congress ministers have definitely ordered sleeping pills after Modi's speech !! '
