 kai actors ke seen dilitakangana ne baaki actors ke seen delit kar die
 Tatya Tope, Kashi's scenes were cut
 kangana ne film kii vailu kam kar di
 This is not just a film
 ye ek ghatana bhar he
 After watching the first edit, Kangana said- "hey, Sonu Sood is not too overpowering to roll? No, he doesn't need a wrestling sequence, he will remove
 kangana ne film main khud par focus kiya he
 " # 3
 sonu sood kaa role khatm karnaa chaahati thim kanganasonu sood ko second half main maranaa tha, lekin kangana unka role interval se pehle hi khatm karnaa chaahati thim
 You cannot say that these scenes will cut, make a little crisp
 aise film mekking nahin hoti
 i have a problem showing Kangana things
 unhon kaha ki sonu femail diarector sang kaam nahin karegaa
 They are wrong
 pataa nahin kyon duusare diarector kangana ke khilaaf aawaaj nahin uthaate
 That is why it has become a habit of Kangana
 # 4
 Kangana's claim was uncoordinated by Kangana that she has directed 70% of Manikarnika
 ise krish ne bebuniyaad bataaya he
 They say they will never work with Kangana again
 mujhe manikarnika ke liye achche rivyuu mil rahe hai
 But this movie could have been bigger
 # 5
 Kangana praised Kangana for taking credit for this
 lekin jab ve credit lenaa chaahati thim to unhone kaha- jo aapane kiya wo acha nahin he, maine ise behatar banaaya he
 i was on 400 days shooting
 film puri kii
 But later i am asked why did you leave the film? # 6
 duusare ek intervyuu main krish ne kaha- jab maine kangana se naam main chhedchhad kii baat kii to ve boleen aapane mujhe sonu sood ke episod main madad nahin kii thi, aapako abhi jarurat he to aae ho
 She shouted at me
 jab maine film dekhi to usamen meraa naam sepperate slide main tha
 i don't know how Kangana can sleep peacefully by putting her name in Direction First Credit

 Late too many times a work is done
 16 july ko dilli main jab pradhanmantri ne antar raji parishad kii baithak bulaai, to sankhya ke hisaab se to ye gyarahavin baithak thi, magar hui das saal baad
 The last time the Chief Minister of the Center and the states met was in December 2006
 isse aap samaj sakate hai ki centre or rajya donon hi antar raji parishad ko lekar kitne gambhir hai
 Whereas the manner in which the talks were held openly, it shows how important and serious the platform is to strengthen the relations between the Center and the States
 bharat ke samvidhan ke artical 263 main likhaa he ki inter state council kaa gathan ho
 It is not a permanent institution
 jab bhi raashtrapati ko lage ki yah janata ke liye zaruri hoga to iskaa gathan kar sakate hai
 It is headed by the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of all states
 centre shasit pradeshon ke up rajyapal bhi iske sadsy hote hai
 6 ministers of cabinet rank nominated from the Prime Minister are also its members
 parishad rajyon se sambandhit kisi bhi mudde par charchaa kar sakati he
 The things that the Chief Ministers of the states have said in front of the center during the meeting, it seems that everything is not right between the state and the center
 sahyogi sanghavaad kahiye yaa team india kahiye, in naaron se alag hakeekat kuch or he
 The difference of ground and sky in the talk of the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister was telling how deep the political mistrust of many states towards the Center
 kuch ke asantosh kaa aadhaar aarthik bhi tha or kuch kaa nitigat bhi
 In this meeting, i want to put some of the things said by the Chief Minister here, so that we know what the states have complaints, expectations and what the Center wants from the states
 tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri jayalalita kii taraf se pannir selvan ne unka bhaashan padhaa or kaha ki endie kaa sahakaari sanghavaad kaa naaraa khokhla rah jayega, agar rajyon ko samuchit shaktiyaan or vittiya sansaadhan nahin die gaye
 a strong center can only be formed from a strong state
 sahakaari sanghavaad desh bhar ke rajyon main ek jaise prashasnic tareeke lagu karne kaa bahaanaa nahin hona chahie
 Jayalalithaa's comment can give an idea of what the states want from the center and how they feel about the talk of Team India at the center
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki centre lagaataar rajyon kii suchi se vishyon ko nikaal kar samavarti suchi main daal rahaa he
 For example, education has been removed from the state list and put in the concurrent list
 centre ko shiksha ke maamle main rajyon ko adhikaar waapas karnaa chahie
 Tamil Nadu feels that the center is infringing on the executive power of the states
 inter state council ke bare main bhi tamilnadu kaa kahana he ki yahaan charchaa to hoti he, magar karrwai nahin hoti he
 This institution should be strengthened further
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne kaha ki aapane das saal baad antar raji baithak kaa aayojan kiya he, to aapane hi rajyon se poocha tak nahin ki agenda kya hona chahie
 We used to get a chance to speak in the Planning Commission, but it is over
 niti ayog main bhi ham ek baar baithak main hissaa lete hai
 They do not listen to us, there is nothing in NITI Aayog
 punjab main akali dal bijepi kii sarkaar he
 The Deputy Chief Minister also had many complaints from the Center
 up mukhyamantri sukhbir badal ne kaha ki rajyon kii sthiti bhikhaariyon jaisi ho gai he
 States should get more powers
 badal ne bhi kaha ki centre samvidhan kii bhaavana or prastaavon ke kilaaf rajyon ke adhikaar or ikbaal par kabza kar rahaa he
 It is common opinion that the trend of centralization of power remains
 zaahir he yah badlaav ek din kaa to nahin he
 But the way the current Prime Minister gives the slogan of Cooperative Federalism and Team India, it seems that the process of giving powers to the states has not changed
 bijepi 14wein vitt ayog ke tahat rajyon ko adhik fund diye jane kii baat karti he, magar rajya ise paryaapt nahin samajhate hai
 Their grievance remains as to the sharing of financial resources
 rajya apni baat sirf vittiya sansadhano ko lekar nahin kah rahe, balki anya vishyon main adhikaron par ho rahe hamale ko lekar bol rahe hai
 Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat said that the 14th Finance Commission has reduced the benefits to states
 lekin is baithak main sabase zyaada awaz uthi rajyapal ke kilaaf
 If you create the image of the governor by taking different elements from everyone's speeches, then something will emerge like this
 rajyapalon ke bare main unke bayanon ko padhate hue, i felt that the governor is a CCTV camera installed in the states
 jiskaa kaam he ki mukhyamantri ke daftar main koun milane aa rahaa he or koun vahaan se nikalakar unase milane aa rahaa he
 Recording video footage of all this and sending its CD to the center has become the Governor's job
 haal ke kai maamalon main vidhayak apni sarkaar or netaa se naaraazgi or avishvaas kii chitthiyaan rajyapal ko bhi likhte rahe hai or rajyapal sweekaar bhi karte rahe hai
 In the Arunachal Pradesh case, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court has clearly stated through a CCTV camera named Governor that he is not an agent of the Center
 lihaaza mukhyamantriyon ko lagata he ki yah sisitivi camera unke kamaron main kuch zyada hi dakhal dene laga he
 Therefore, this CCTV camera should be removed so that the Chief Ministers feel that they are not under any surveillance
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki jab tak ise hataaya nahin jaataa, iske lagane kii prakriya paardarshee ho or arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki mukhyamantri se poochkar ise lagaaya jaae
 Jayalalithaa said that this CCTV named Governor should be removed only after impeachment and not by the President's will
 nitish ne kaha ki jab laga hi rahe hai to camere kaa remote mukhyamantri ke paas ho or yah rajya mantrimandal kii sahaayta or paraamarsh se kaam kare
 After imposing President's rule in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand and after proving it wrong in court, many states were very apprehensive about the imposition of President's rule
 khaskar gaiyr bhaajapa sarkaron ke mukhyamantri
 Chief Ministers of bjp-ruled states did not raise the question of encroachment of states by the Center
 aakhir wo apni hi centre sarkaar se kaise kah sakate the ki rajyon ke adhikaar kaa atikaraman ho rahaa he
 Governors seem to be doing quite well in BJP ruled states
 madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha ki soshal media ke galat istemaal par roak lagane kii zarurat he
 Several steps have to be taken to stop radicalism
 rajya or centre ke bich real time main khufia soochnaaon kii saajheedaari honi chahie
 The comments ho saktaa he ki akhabaaron ne bhaajapa virdohi dalon kii sarkaron ke mukhyamantriyon kii shikayaton ko hi zyada report kiya varna jitani bhi reporting hui he usase yahi lagata he ki bijepi ke mukhyamantriyon ko na to niti ayog se dikkat he, na unhen kisi maamle main fund milane se dikkat he, na unhen rajyon kii suchi ke vishay ko samavarti suchi main daalane se dikkat he
 The concurrent list means that both the Center and the state can make laws in that matter, but if the Center has made it then only the law made by Parliament will be valid
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne is avasar par kaha ki Due to the 14th Finance Commission, the share of states in central taxes has increased from 32 percent to 42 percent
 2015-16 main rajyon ko centre se 2014-15 kii tulana main 21 pratishat adhik raashi mili he
 Auction of coal mines will give the states about three and a half lakh crores in the coming years
 jo bhi rajya kerosene kii khapat main kami karegaa, uski sabsidi kaa 75 fisadi hissaa centre use degaa
 The Prime Minister means something more about the Center, the Chief Minister means the direction of the states
 pradhanmantri ne dhara 356 ke beza istamaal, raashtrapati shashan ko lekar rajyon kii ashanka ko lekar kuch nahin kaha
 It was said that discussion should be held in open environment and everyone should give their suggestions
 pradhanmantri is baithak ko Cooperative Federalism kii bhaavana kaa pratik bataa rahe the, kai rajya isi kooparative federlism kii bhaavana ke paalan nahin hone par sawaal uthaa rahe the
 Such a meeting between all of them after 10 years is also no less welcome in itself, which again gives us an opportunity to understand the relationship between the Center and the States on a practical basis instead of beautiful slogans
 kooparative federlism par jab acchhee acchhee baaten kahi ja rahi thi, usee vakt arunachal main ek barkhaast sarkaar phir se behaal ho rahi thi
 The things that the Chief Ministers of the states have said in front of the center during the meeting, it seems that everything is not right between the state and the center

 The Prime Minister means something more about the Center, the Chief Minister means the direction of the states
 pradhanmantri ne dhara 356 ke beza istamaal, raashtrapati shashan ko lekar rajyon kii ashanka ko lekar kuch nahin kaha
 It was said that discussion should be held in open environment and everyone should give their suggestions
 pradhanmantri is baithak ko Cooperative Federalism kii bhaavana kaa pratik bataa rahe the, kai rajya isi kooparative federlism kii bhaavana ke paalan nahin hone par sawaal uthaa rahe the
 Such a meeting between all of them after 10 years is also no less welcome in itself, which again gives us an opportunity to understand the relationship between the Center and the States on a practical basis instead of beautiful slogans
 kooparative federlism par jab acchhee acchhee baaten kahi ja rahi thi, usee vakt arunachal main ek barkhaast sarkaar phir se behaal ho rahi thi
 Jayalalithaa's comment can give an idea of what the states want from the center and how they feel about the talk of Team India at the center
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki centre lagaataar rajyon kii suchi se vishyon ko nikaal kar samavarti suchi main daal rahaa he
 For example, education has been removed from the state list and put in the concurrent list
 centre ko shiksha ke maamle main rajyon ko adhikaar waapas karnaa chahie
 Tamil Nadu feels that the center is infringing on the executive power of the states
 inter state council ke bare main bhi tamilnadu kaa kahana he ki yahaan charchaa to hoti he, magar karrwai nahin hoti he
 This institution should be strengthened further
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne kaha ki aapane das saal baad antar raji baithak kaa aayojan kiya he, to aapane hi rajyon se poocha tak nahin ki agenda kya hona chahie
 We used to get a chance to speak in the Planning Commission, but it is over
 niti ayog main bhi ham ek baar baithak main hissaa lete hai
 They do not listen to us, there is nothing in NITI Aayog
 punjab main akali dal bijepi kii sarkaar he
 The Deputy Chief Minister also had many complaints from the Center
 up mukhyamantri sukhbir badal ne kaha ki rajyon kii sthiti bhikhaariyon jaisi ho gai he
 States should get more powers
 badal ne bhi kaha ki centre samvidhan kii bhaavana or prastaavon ke kilaaf rajyon ke adhikaar or ikbaal par kabza kar rahaa he
 It is common opinion that the trend of centralization of power remains
 zaahir he yah badlaav ek din kaa to nahin he
 But the way the current Prime Minister gives the slogan of Cooperative Federalism and Team India, it seems that the process of giving powers to the states has not changed
 bijepi 14wein vitt ayog ke tahat rajyon ko adhik fund diye jane kii baat karti he, magar rajya ise paryaapt nahin samajhate hai
 Their grievance remains as to the sharing of financial resources
 rajya apni baat sirf vittiya sansadhano ko lekar nahin kah rahe, balki anya vishyon main adhikaron par ho rahe hamale ko lekar bol rahe hai
 Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat said that the 14th Finance Commission has reduced the benefits to states
 lekin is baithak main sabase zyaada awaz uthi rajyapal ke kilaaf
 If you create the image of the governor by taking different elements from everyone's speeches, then something will emerge like this
 rajyapalon ke bare main unke bayanon ko padhate hue, i felt that the governor is a CCTV camera installed in the states
 jiskaa kaam he ki mukhyamantri ke daftar main koun milane aa rahaa he or koun vahaan se nikalakar unase milane aa rahaa he
 Recording video footage of all this and sending its CD to the center has become the Governor's job
 haal ke kai maamalon main vidhayak apni sarkaar or netaa se naaraazgi or avishvaas kii chitthiyaan rajyapal ko bhi likhte rahe hai or rajyapal sweekaar bhi karte rahe hai
 In the Arunachal Pradesh case, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court has clearly stated through a CCTV camera named Governor that he is not an agent of the Center
 lihaaza mukhyamantriyon ko lagata he ki yah sisitivi camera unke kamaron main kuch zyada hi dakhal dene laga he
 Therefore, this CCTV camera should be removed so that the Chief Ministers feel that they are not under any surveillance
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki jab tak ise hataaya nahin jaataa, iske lagane kii prakriya paardarshee ho or arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki mukhyamantri se poochkar ise lagaaya jaae
 Jayalalithaa said that this CCTV named Governor should be removed only after impeachment and not by the President's will
 nitish ne kaha ki jab laga hi rahe hai to camere kaa remote mukhyamantri ke paas ho or yah rajya mantrimandal kii sahaayta or paraamarsh se kaam kare
 After imposing President's rule in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand and after proving it wrong in court, many states were very apprehensive about the imposition of President's rule
 khaskar gaiyr bhaajapa sarkaron ke mukhyamantri
 Chief Ministers of bjp-ruled states did not raise the question of encroachment of states by the Center
 aakhir wo apni hi centre sarkaar se kaise kah sakate the ki rajyon ke adhikaar kaa atikaraman ho rahaa he
 Governors seem to be doing quite well in BJP ruled states
 madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha ki soshal media ke galat istemaal par roak lagane kii zarurat he
 Several steps have to be taken to stop radicalism
 rajya or centre ke bich real time main khufia soochnaaon kii saajheedaari honi chahie
 The comments ho saktaa he ki akhabaaron ne bhaajapa virdohi dalon kii sarkaron ke mukhyamantriyon kii shikayaton ko hi zyada report kiya varna jitani bhi reporting hui he usase yahi lagata he ki bijepi ke mukhyamantriyon ko na to niti ayog se dikkat he, na unhen kisi maamle main fund milane se dikkat he, na unhen rajyon kii suchi ke vishay ko samavarti suchi main daalane se dikkat he
 The concurrent list means that both the Center and the state can make laws in that matter, but if the Center has made it then only the law made by Parliament will be valid
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne is avasar par kaha ki Due to the 14th Finance Commission, the share of states in central taxes has increased from 32 percent to 42 percent
 2015-16 main rajyon ko centre se 2014-15 kii tulana main 21 pratishat adhik raashi mili he
 Auction of coal mines will give the states about three and a half lakh crores in the coming years
 jo bhi rajya kerosene kii khapat main kami karegaa, uski sabsidi kaa 75 fisadi hissaa centre use degaa

 kooparative federlism par jab acchhee acchhee baaten kahi ja rahi thi, usee vakt arunachal main ek barkhaast sarkaar phir se behaal ho rahi thi
 The Akali Dal is a BJP government in Punjab
 vahaan ke up mukhyamantri ko bhi centre se tamaam shikaayatein raheen
 Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal said that the situation in the states has become like a beggar
 rajyon ko or zyaada shaktiyaan milani chahie
 Badal also said that the Center is taking possession of the rights and Iqbal of the states against the spirit and proposals of the Constitution
 sabaki aam raay he ki satta ke kendrikaran kaa trend bana hua he
 Obviously, this change is not of a day
 lekin jis tarah se maujuuda pradhanmantri kooparative federlism or team india kaa naaraa dete hai, usase lagata he ki rajyon ko adhikaar diye jane kii prakriya main badlaav nahin aayaa he
 The BJP talks of giving more funds to the states under the 14th Finance Commission, but the states do not consider it sufficient
 unki shikaayat vittiya sansaadhan ke bantwaare ko lekar jas kii tas bani hui he
 States are not talking about financial resources, but are talking about the attack on rights in other subjects
 uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri harish ravat ne kaha ki 14 wein vitt ayog ne rajyon ko milane vaale phaayde kam kar diye hai
 But the loudest voice in this meeting was against the Governor
 agar aap sabhi ke bhaashanon se alag alag tatwon ko lekar rajyapal kii chhavi banaaen to kuch is tarah ubharegi
 Reading his statements about the governors, mujhe laga ki rajyapal rajyon main centre kii taraf se lagaaya jane vaala sisitivi camera he
 Whose job is who is coming to meet the Chief Minister's office and who is coming out of there to meet them
 in sabakaa video footage ricard karnaa or uski sidi centre ko bhejnaa rajyapal kaa kaam rah gaya he
 In many recent cases, mlas have been writing letters of resentment and distrust from their government and leaders to the Governor and have also accepted the Governor
 arunachal pradesh ke maamle main supreme court kii paanch jajon kii bench ne rajyapal naamak sisitivi camere se saaf-saaf kaha he ki wo centre kaa agent nahin he
 Therefore, the Chief Ministers feel that this CCTV camera is starting to interfere in their rooms too much
 isliye is sisitivi camere ko hi hataa dena chahie taaki mukhyamantriyon ko lage ki ve kisi nigaraanee main nahin hai
 Nitish Kumar said that till it is removed, the process of planting it should be transparent and Arvind Kejriwal asked that it be planted by asking the Chief Minister
 jayalalita ne kaha ki rajyapal naam ke is sisitivi ko mahabhiyog ke baad hi hataaya janaa chahie na ki raashtrapati kii marzi se
 Nitish said that while the cameras are being installed, the camera remote should be with the Chief Minister and it should work with the help and consultation of the State Cabinet
 arunachal pradesh or uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane or court main ise galat sabit hone ke baad kai rajya raashtrapati shashan lagane kii dhara 356 ko lekar kaaphi ashankit dikhe
 Especially the chief ministers of non-bjp governments
 bhaajapa shasit pradeshon ke mukhyamantriyon ne centre dwaara rajyon ke atikaraman kaa sawaal nahin uthaaya
 After all, how could he tell his own central government that the rights of the states were being violated
 lagata he bijepi shasit rajyon main rajyapal kaaphi acha kaam kar rahe hai
 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that there is a need to stop the misuse of social media
 kattarwad ko rokane ke liye kai kadam uthaane honge
 There should be real-time intelligence sharing between the state and the center
 tippaniyan It may be that the newspapers reported more than the complaints of the Chief Ministers of the anti-bjp parties governments, or whatever the reporting has done, it seems that the Chief Ministers of the BJP neither have problems with the NITI Aayog nor do they get funds in any case
 They have no problem with putting the subject of the list of states in the concurrent list
 samavarti suchi kaa matlab yah hua ki us maamle main centre or rajya donon hi kanoon bana sakate hai, magar centre ne bana diya to sansad kaa banaaya kanoon hi maanya hoga
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on the occasion that 14 wein vitt ayog ke kaaran kendriya karon main rajyon kii hissedari 32 pratishat se badhkar 42 pratishat ho gai he
 States have received 21 percent more from the Center in 2015-16 than in 2014-15
 koyala khadaanon kii nilaamee se rajyon ko aane vaale varshon main kareeb saadhe teen lakh karod raashi milegi
 The Center will give 75 percent of its subsidy to whichever state reduces kerosene consumption
 pradhanmantri yani centre kii baat kuch or, mukhyamantri yani rajyon kii baat kii disha kahin or
 The Prime Minister did not say anything about the apprehension of the states regarding the rule of President rule, using section 356
 yah zarur kaha ki khule maahaul main charchaa ho or sabhi apana suzav den
 The Prime Minister was calling this meeting a symbol of the spirit of Cooperative Federalism, with many states questioning the non-adherence to the spirit of Cooperative Federalism
 in sabake bich is tarah kii baithak 10 saal baad hui yah bhi apane aapmen kam swaagat yogya nahin he, jo phir se hamen centre or rajyon ke bich ke sambandh ko khubasurat naaron kii jagah vyaavhaarik aadhaar par sochane samajhane kaa mauka detii he
 At the same time, a sacked government in Arunachal was being restored when good things were being said about cooperative federalism
 zaahir he yah badlaav ek din kaa to nahin he
 But the way the current Prime Minister gives the slogan of Cooperative Federalism and Team India, it seems that the process of giving powers to the states has not changed

 bharat se bal vivaah khatm kar diya jaae to bharat ko aarthik rup se kitna laabh ho saktaa he, iskaa aap andaja bhi nahin laga sakate
 You should understand that the entire education budget can be prepared with that savings
 world bank or international centre for research on women (ICRW) ne bharat ko lekar kuch aisi hi hairaan kar dene vaali report jari kii he
 According to World Bank and ICRW reports, India can save Rs 33,500 crore in healthcare over the next 7 years
 lekin iske liye use bal vivaah ko jad se samaapt karnaa hoga
 Children who sleep late at night are fickle, do not stay in one place Dhyanayani India can save almost as much money as it spends on education budgets through child marriage immunity
 saal 2017-18 kaa ucch shiksha bajet 33,329 rupee kaa he
 After ending child marriage, India can save even more money
 haalanki bal vivaah kii samasya bharat ke alaava duniya ke duusare deshon main bhi he
 Globally, 18 countries come together by the year 2030
 14 lakh karod rupee bachaa sakate hai
 But India accounts for 60 per cent of it due to its maximum population
 darasal, bal vivaah ko khatm karne se jansankhya vruddhi par sidhaa asar hoga
 The population growth rate will decrease, which will also reduce the pressure on the government budget
 smartphone kii lat drugs jaisi, bacchon ko bana sakati he mandabudhiisi tarah saal 2030 tak duniya ke 106 desh agar bal vivaah khatm karte hai to 566 billian dollar kii bachat ho sakati he
 The World Health Organization report also shows a different aspect of child marriage
 report ke anusaar bal vivaah karne vaali bacchiyon ke saath maar-peet, gaali-galouj aadi jaise aparaadhik maamle zyada hote hai
 They are also more prone to dangerous diseases like HIV / AIDS
 aise bachche skool kii padhai bhi puri nahin karte or kam umr main hi bachche ko janm dete hai, jo unamem kai tarah kii bimariyon kaa kaaran bhi banataa he

 jiem kaa virodh kar rahe activist kah rahe hai ki beati bangan par adhik kade prayog kiye gaye the par ehtiyaat ke taur par use roka gaya lekin jiem sarson ko anumati kyon di ja rahi he
 Only four countries in the world are allowed to grow GM mustard, including the US, Canada
 australia shaamil hai
 Supporters and scientists of GM mustard argue that GM mustard oil is already being imported from Canada
 isliye jiem food kaa dar failaana bevajaah kaa hauvva he
 Now it remains to be seen whether the government will allow GGM mustard to grow in the fields in October and if yes, will it lead to the same revolution that is being claimed
 jiem sarson agar kheton main ugaaya gaya to yah pehali geneticali modyphid khaadya fasal hogi
 Bt cotton has been grown in our country for many years but it is not a food crop
 dhyaan dene kii baat he ki jiem food ke tahat aane vaale beati bangan ko ugane kii anumati 2010 main mil gai thi lekin tab sawaalon ke maddenjar tatkaaleen paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh ne us par roak laga di thi
 Activists opposing GM are saying that more stringent experiments were done on Bt brinjal but it was stopped as a precaution but why GM mustard is being allowed
 duniya ke keval chaar deshon main hi jiem sarson ko ugane kii anumati he jisamen america, canada
 Australia
 jiem sarson ke samarthakon or vaigyanikon kaa tark he ki canada se pehle hi jiem sarson kaa tel aayaat ho rahaa he
 Therefore, the fear of GM food is unnecessary
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki kya sarkaar jijiem sarson ko oktober main kheton main ugane ke liye anumati degi or agar haa to kya isse vahi kranti aegi jiskaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he

 Similarly, the prices of food items are skyrocketing

 BJP has announced Delhi bandh
 mudda he mahangaai kaa
 Inflation has made people happy and the government does not have time to increase the fare of bus, metro rail
 dilli main rahanaa dubhar he
 The living of the public due to inflation is out of tolerance
 kichan ke kharche ne qamar tod di he or bas-metro ke kiraaye ne jeena muhaal kar diya he
 Only after a long time, the BJP is raising this issue of the general public loudly and today announced the Delhi Bandh

 unhone bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki jahaan kahin bhi bijepi kii sarkaar hoti he to vahaan kii jameen udyogpatiyon ko saunp di jaati he or kisaanon ko kuch nahin miltaa
 Rahul Gandhi said, you see that wherever the BJP government has been, the land is given to the industrialists while the farmers are not given their rightful land, when they are the rightful owners
 unhone aage kaha ki chhattisgarh main bijepi sarkaar ke samay adivaasiyon se jameen chhinakar udyogpatiyon ko de di jaati thi
 We brought tribal bill, forest rights law and BJP abolished this system
 itihaas main pehali baar tata se jameen lekar waapas adivaasiyon ko di gai
 He said in his election rally that there is no shortage of wealth in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, but the common people and tribals are not benefiting from it

 The debt of farmers was not waived under Modi rule
 Rahul Gandhi said that it has been five and a half years for the Modi government at the center, but this government has not waived the loan of farmers
 jahaan bhi bijepi kii sarkaar he vahaan kii jameen udyogpatiyon ko mil jaati he, lekin adivaasiyon or garibon ko kuch nahin miltaa
 The BJP government says that you are a tribal, the land is yours, but we will give it to the industrialist
 chhattisgarh main bijepi sarkaar ne adivaasiyon kii jameen chin-chhinakar udyogpatiyon ko baant di
 He further said that it has been 5 and a half years to the Modi government, but the debt of farmers has not been waived
 jahaan bhi congress kii sarkaar ai, vahaan kisaanon kaa karja maaf kiya gaya

 With the passing of this bill, the Gurjar community will now get 5 percent reservation
 bataa den ki beete kuch samay se gurjar samudaay ke log andolan kar rahe the, jisaki vajah se rail yatayaat se lekar sadak yatayaat kii sevaayen prabhavit ho rahi thim
 Already, there were indications that the Gurjars could end the agitation by once again giving five per cent reservation to the Gurjars (and other Banjara or nomadic tribes)
 iske liye rajya sarkaar ne pehle se maujuud rajasthan pichhadaa varg bill, 2017 main sanshodhan pesh kiya, jiske tahat varsh 2017 main gurjaron ko sarvaadhik pichhadaa varg ke rup main paanch fisadi aarakshan diya gaya tha, or anya pichhadaa varg ko 26 fisadi tak badha diya gaya tha
 Now the government is going to add a line to this bill
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki centre sarkaar ne aarthik rup se pichde varg ko 10 fisadi aarakshan diya he, so, rajasthan sarkaar sarvaadhik pichhadaa varg (gurjar tathaa chaar anya banjaaraa athwa khanaabadosh janajatiyaan) ko paanch fisadi aarakshan kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Another argument of the government is also that the population of obcs is now close to 55 per cent, so they should be given more reservation
 mangalvaar shaam ko jaipur main cabinet baithak ke dauraan is par charchaa hui, tathaa ise buudhvaar ko centre dwaara die gaye 10 fisadi aarakshan ke saath hi sadan main pesh kiya jayega
 The government is also seeking legal advice in this matter, because the quota of reservation in the state exceeded 50 per cent when the Gujjars were given five percent reservation, which was overturned by the Rajasthan High Court twice

 The CPI (M) has also said that the role of Chidambaram needs to be looked into

 Meanwhile, Union Law Minister Salman Khurshid has defended Chidambaram, saying that it is unfair to link the home minister with crime

 istipha dene ke 24 ghante baad aakhirkaar laal krishna adwani maan gaye
 BJP President Rajnath Singh announced this in the presence of several party leaders
 adwani ke ghar par hi press conference bulaai gai thi, haalanki khud adwani press conference main maujuud nahin the
 Rajnath Singh told everyone about Advani's decision
 unhone kaha ki sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne adwani se baat kii or unhen party kaa faisla kabool karne kii salaah di
 Advani accepted his advice
 apane istife kii chitthee main adwani ne party ke rang-dhang par jo aitraaj jataayaa tha, use lekar rajnath or adwani ke bich baatcheet hui
 Rajnath said that whenever Advani ji has any kind of complaint, he himself will talk to them
 adwani ke press conference main nahin aane ke sawaal par rajnath singh ne kaha, 'yah saamaanya shishtachar he
 i would have spoken at the press conference and he would have been sitting next to me, that is not fair
 'apane hi ghar ke baithkkhaane se nadaarad kyon the adwani?goa nahin gaye yah samaj main aata he lekin yah samaj main nahin aayaa ki apane hi ghar ke baithkkhaane se nadaarad kyon the adwani
 Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat forced Advani to change his decision
 adwani kuch or nahin kar sakate the
 For two days, Rajnath Singh had been constantly explaining to Advani that he would have to agree today if not today or else he would have to sign his letter by beating his heart, because Modi will not be taken down from where he has reached
 rajnath singh ko yah ikkaa phenkane ke liye rajasthan janaa padaa
 Visiting Banswara clearly came out
 bhashaa bhale alag ho, lekin matlab yahi tha ki adwani bade hai, sahi hai, adwani bajurg hai yah bhi sahi he, adwani kii vajah se bijepi he yah bhi sahi he, lekin vah jo ab kar rahe hai wo sahi nahin he
 Amid this pain from the BJP, the sad spirits of the party continued to reach Advani's residence
 kuch aradhana ke liye gaye or kuch afsos jataane, lekin baahar nikle to ummid kaa jhootha diya sabane saamne kar diya
 Will agree sir
 bijepi ne adwani par hi choda faisladansal adwani ke ilaaj kaa chiraag bijepi ne adwani ke hi aale main chhod diya tha
 Burn it if you want and leave it extinguished
 ilaaj yah tha ki bijepi ab aise hi chalegi
 It is now up to him whether he will walk together or retreat
 laal krishna adwani lagaataar laal najar aate rahe, lekin yah sach he ki maan janaa unki iklauti or antim majaburi thi or maje kii baat yah he ki maan jane kaa bahaanaa khojane kii zimmedaari bhi bijepi ne apane bujurg par daal di
 Some came from Bhopal, some from Patna and some from the neighborhood, but after coming out, everyone said that Advani should be accepted, because nothing else can be understood
 adwani ruthe hi the maan jane ke liesham hote-hote tay ho gaya ki adwani maan jaaenge
 He agreed to half in the afternoon
 aadhe kaa sawaal tha wo siyasat ne tay kar diya
 Overall, Advani was unhappy to be accepted
 vahi bijepi, vahi netaa or vahi faisle, lekin adwani maan gaye
 There was a ruckus while sitting in the house and while sitting there, i also agreed
 jaswant singh iklaute netaa hai, jinhone ruuth jane ke peeche unki bhaawanaaon kaa zikr kiya ki bijepi ke kuch netaa nijee agenda puraa karne main lage hai
 The issues were not to be resolved, because the issues raised by Advani were before Modi became so important and will remain even later, but in these two days, it has become clear that Advani has understood that BJP Is a god of the past
 samaj nahin aayaa adwani kaa maan janajise adwani kaa ruuth janaa kisi kii samaj main nahin aayaa vaise hi adwani kaa maan janaa bhi kisi kii samaj main nahin aayaa, lekin wo baqayada ruthe bhi or maane bhi
 Advani expressed both feelings from the closed room
 thik to hona hi tha, kyonki iske alaava koi chaara nahin tha, lekin sawaal ab doosraa he or vah sawaal yah he ki adwani ab karenge kya?party ke saamne unhone ek duvidha khadi kar di thi ki use narendra bhai or laal krishna main se ek ko chunanaa hoga
 The party said there is no dilemma
 phir adwani ne puri party par sawaal uthaate hue rajnath singh ko chitthee kyon likhi or jab likh hidito do din main kya badal gaya bijepi main?kya unhen sachmuch party kii chhavi kii chintaa hone lagi thi? yaa phir vahasamajh gaye the ki sangh ke dabaav ke baad modi par bijepi ke liye you turn ab mumkin nahin? yaa phir party or adwani main koi bich kaa rasta nikal aayaa, jisamen pad or sammaan donon kii gunjaaish ho
 Didn't the party care about Advani? The truth is that the party had given up on Advani's displeasure
 goa se lautne ke baad ek din jarur netaaon ne isapar chintaa bhi jataai, lekin agle hi din sab apane-apane kaam main lag gaye
 Narendra Modi kept holding separate conferences and Rajnath Singh separated
 baaki bache samay main adwani ke liye jitna soch liya utana soch liya

 The dilemma before both the police squads was that they did not have to let the accused escape and they had to be questioned according to the law
 saath hi yah bhi dekhnaa tha ki bhakton ko koi nuksaan na ho
 DIG Gupta said, “we did not particularly want to repeat the incident at Ramlila Maidan with Baba Ramdev
 hamaara puraa dhyaan is baat par tha ki kisi bhakt ko ek bhi lathi na lage
 “more than 4,000 devotees from far and wide spread green mats on the roads leading to the ashram
 ab police na to asaram ko lekar un par se guzar sakati thi or na hi jeep ko ashram ke bheetar le ja sakati thi
 The police had also searched the ashram for three days
 usne dekha ki ek sadak aisi he jis par sirf sevak aate jate hai
 Policemen in plain uniform were stationed there and policemen in uniform stood on the rest of the streets
 raat ko 11 baje ke aasapaas sevakon ne police kii chaal bhaanp lee or ve teesri sadak par bhi chataaiyaan bichaane lage
 Seeing his move failing, the Indore police told the Jodhpur police to get the job done quickly and strictly
 asaram ne kabhi aatmahatya kii dhamkee di to kabhi khud ko kamare main band kar liya or phir raat ke khaane ke liye gaayab ho gaya
 Informed sources say that he was deferring in the hope that the father of the complaining girl would be able to buy
 asaram ko yakeen nahin ho rahaa tha ki uske rajnatik bhakt use dagaa de denge
 But sources say that his strong speeches backfired
 indore kaa kila dhahne kii ek vajah yah bhi thi ki media din-raat peeche laga hua tha
 When Asaram finds out that Narendra Modi has left, he leaves the flight from Bhopal to Ahmedabad
 use jab yah laga ki nai dilli main rajnatik galiyare ke daravaaje band ho chuke hai to vah is ummid main indore bhaag gaya ki badi sankhya main samarthak bulaakar kuch vakt nikaal legaa
 Police sources say that the ACP Chanchal of Jodhpur settled the matter on the strength of his strong intentions, when Asaram locked himself in the room, he threatened to break the door
 asipi ne thaan liya tha ki chaahe jo ho jaae, asaram kii giraftaar hogi or mukademe ko anjaam tak pahunchaaya jayega
 Finally, from any point of view, the reason for his downfall became a strong female officer
 indore ashram ke liye daravaaje band karne main bahut der ho chuki he

 abhi mushkil se dedhek maheene hi hue hai nitish kumaar ko bihar ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath liye, lekin argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav ke saath unhone jis 'mahagathbandhan' kaa tanabana buna tha, vah pehle hi gahare dabaav main aata dikhaai de rahaa he
 The comparison of Sholay's famous pair of Jai and Viru is now a thing of the past
 'bahari' bijepi ko dhul chataane vaale bihariyon kii baat bhi ab koi nahin karata
 Over the course of a month, the game of knocking each other out of the alliance partners has started
 bijepi netaa or purv upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi kehete hai, ''nitish mukhyamantri hai, magar lalu pehle hi super mukhyamantri kii tarah bartaav karne lage hai
 Lalu Prasad's 80 seats as compared to Nitish's 71 seats, but the rjd's slight edge in the assembly has also increased the chief minister's problems
 aane vaali ghatnaon kii ek jhalak 29 disambar ko hi mil gai thi jab lalu ne press conference kar rajya main badhate aparaadhon par chintaa jaahir kii or mukhyamantri ko sujhaavon kii fehrist bhi de daali ki isse nipatane ke liye unhen kya karnaa chahie or kya nahin
 This raised eyebrows in Nitish's camp
 jedy (you) ke pravaktaa niraj kumaar or rajya adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh ne pratikriya dene main deree nahin kii
 He clearly asked Lalu to eclipse
 varisht narayan singh ne to argedy pramukh par tanj kasate hue kaha ki har koi jaanata he, unki party rajya ko (apane shasankaal ke dauraan) kitni buree haalat main chhod gai thi, jise nitish ko saaf karnaa padaa tha
 Satire and rants were rained on both sides, but the manner in which senior leaders of both camps were speaking exaggeratedly, it seemed that they had the power of party leaders
 aankade nahin nattejeyis sari gahamagahami ke bich aam taur par shant or sanyat rahane vaale nitish main bhi achaanak tanaav ke lakshan dikhaai dene lage
 This was reflected in the first meeting of this tenure of the Department of Revenue and Land Reforms
 mukhyamantri chaay ke apane cap ke saath abhi virajman hue hi the or pradhan sachiv vyas ji ne bhoomi adhigrahan prakriya ke bare main apana power point prajentation pesh kiya
 Although everyone was of the opinion that the presentation was excellent, but the Chief Minister, clearly unhappy, said, being a little impatient, he said, "we all know this
" is sabase aakhir kitna fark padegaa? hamen land equisishan kii vaastavik prakriya ko aasaan bananaa hi hoga
 Take the example of the Ganges driveway
 mahakme ko jameen adhigrahan kaa kaam puraa karne ke liye sadak nirmaan or patna ke jila prashasan ke saath kareebi talmail kaayam karne kaam karnaa chahie
 a few moments later, Nitish was rebuking another over-zealous IAS officer
 unki baton ke jawaab main mukhyamantri ne kaha, ''aapako yahaan par le aaenge to sara land equisishan ho jayega naa?'' haalanki nitish kii jhidki unki muskaan ke saath ai thi, magar unki nagawari kamare main maujuud darjan bhar iees afasaron kii najar se batch nahin saki
 Nitish, turning 65 in March, cannot afford to fail in his fifth term as Bihar Chief Minister
 upar jis baithak kaa zikr he, usase chah din pehle 28 disambar ko mukhyamantri sheersh police afasaron ke ek samooh ke saath bhi itani hi rukhaai se pesh aae
 These officers gathered at his door for a meeting
 nitish ne na keval unka prajentation dekhne se inkaar kar diya, balki zyaadaatar ko, jinamein sabhi varisht ipies afasar the, ulte paanv lautaa diya
 Nitish told him, "go back to your office and do what you are expected to do
" '' nitish ek nijee bijli company ke suparvizer or darbhanga main do ejiniyaron kii (bataate hai ki unki sadak nirmaan company ke rangadari dene se inkaar kar dene par) hatya ke baad kanoon-vyavastha kii lagaataar girti haalat se naaraaz the, jise jaahir karne main unhone kotahi nahin kii
 He said in clear words, "I don't want crime rate figures
" main yahaan badanaami kamaane ke liye nahin hum
 This is happening because you guys don't do what is expected
 mujhe nattejey chahie
 Not enough arrest, confiscate their property
 ''lalu peeche se haank rahe hai?argedy ke mukhiya ne rajkaaj ke maamalon main abhi tak bahut zyada dakhsandaji to nahin kii he lekin sarkaar par unki chhap saaf dikhaai detii he
 Although Nitish is commanded by the General Administration Department, Lalu has two of his best IAS officers Sudhir Kumar and R
K
 ke
 Mahajan has got his two sons Tejashwi and Tej Pratap posted in the departments
 ye donon unke saath railway mantralay main the
 Sources in the Secretariat also state that Lalu is heard in the deployment of officers, but this can be understood as being the leader of his biggest party in Bihar
 bihar kaa satta pratishthan bhi in dinon partiyon ke niyantran vaale sarkari mahakamon ke hisaab se bant gaya maaloom hota he
 Both Nitish and Lalu have 12 ministers each in the 29-member cabinet, including the chief minister
 baaki mantri congress ke hai
 Many people have started to believe that the command of power in Bihar is no longer just a home
 satta ke do kendron ke bich andruni hode kaa donon netaaon ke upar bhi ek duusare se bilkul ulta asar pad rahaa he
 Lalu is enjoying power without any responsibility, while the pressure of power is falling on Nitish with responsibilities
 asal main chizon ko chust-durust karne ke chakkar main ve bahut zyada haath-pair maarthe dikhaai de rahe hai
 The decision to ban liquor in Bihar on November 20 within a week of assuming the throne is its present example
 yah bataata he ki mukhyamantri apane pichley kaarykalon se kitni dur aa gaye hai
 In previous tenures, he had laid great emphasis on monitoring of liquor sales to increase revenue (rs 4,000 crore from liquor sales in 2015-16
 kaa rajasav milane kii ummid he)
 Today they are ready to bear the brunt of cash in the treasury, so is it for the sake of overtaking Lalu in the race of popularity? If so, they have succeeded in this for the moment
 bihar main pehle 1 april se desi sharaab par roak lagegi or phir sitambar main aaayaatit sharaab bikni band ho jaaegi
 Enormous on the envelope, he knows very well that what the people think and believe about his government is as much weight as reality
 haal hi main unhone apana naam kafile main laal batti lagaakar chalane vaali viypi kii fehrist se hatwa diya
 Nitish understands that his political standing is no longer just that of a Chief Minister, but he is seen as an alternative leader of every anti-bjp gathering in the country looking for a trusted central leader for 2019
 lagaataar teen baar jeet hasil karke unhone gujarat main narendra modi ke record kii barabari kar lee he
 Then the achievements of his previous tenures are also with him, which has shown a clear improvement in the areas of roads, education, energy and health
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki nae kaarykaal main ve rajkaaj ke maamalon main or bhi bad-chadhakar kaam kar rahe hai
 Instead of playing a secondary role in front of Lalu, he has chosen to be aggressive
 sutara bataate hai ki unka iraadaa kaam karne vaale mutthi bhar afasaron ko surakshit kaarykaal dene kaa he
 Low-income departments like urban development and industry are also on target
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab nitish ek aisi sarkaar kii aguai kar rahe hai, jisamen unke vidhayakon kii ginati unka samarthan kar rahe gathbandhan ke vidhayakon se kam he
 In his first term as Chief Minister of Bihar, in March 2000, when that government was able to run for only seven days, Nitish had only 34 mlas against bjp's 67 mlas
 magar vah alahada vakt tha
 The BJP supported Nitish as a junior partner, even then the decisions were made by Nitish and the saffron partners worked from behind the scenes
 magar jab gathbandhan ke or vah bhi bade saajheedaar lalu hon to khel badal jaataa he
 In the coming days, it is possible that the Chief Minister felt that winning the Assembly elections was an easy part of the game
 ab ek haath se lalu ke tufaan ko thamte hue duusare haath se apni kendriya mahatvakankshaon ko paravaan chadhaanaa unki sabase mushkil chunauti he
 Yogguru Baba Ramdev's statement has also come on the issue of farmer movement going on in many places across the country
 baba ramdev kaa kahana he ki angrejon ke samay kisaanon kii haalat kaaphi acchhee thi, kisaanon ko acha laabh mulya milanaa chahie
 Baba Ramdev said this during a yoga camp held in Motihari, Bihar
 rahul gandhi ke mandsaur daure par ramdev bole ki kisaanon ke andolan kii aag main ghi daalane kii raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 Ramdev said that the central Keenendra Modi government has made several policies for the farmers, now is the time to put these policies on the ground
 unhone kaha ki kisaan ayog banaakar kisaanon ke hiton kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 Ramdev said that politics is also happening continuously in the name of farmers, farmers are not unhappy everywhere
 agar aisa hota to punjab ke kisaan bhi andolan kar rahe hote
 It is worth noting that for the last several days, farmers have been agitating in different parts of the country about their issues
 maharashtra main teen kisaanon ne khudakushi kar lee he, to vahiin madhyapradesh main pulisia golibari main 5 kisaanon kii maut ho gai he
 Due to which the political atmosphere is hot
 vahiin duusari ore, baba ramdev yoga diwas ke aane se pehle puure desh main ghumkar yoga shivi laga rahe hai
 Refusing to deal with the habit of urinating people in public places, the Delhi High Court said it cannot ensure that individuals do not urinate outside after leaving their homes
 awasaiya parisar ke diwaar par lagi devi-devataaon kii tasveeron ko hataane kaa nirdesh dene kaa anurodh karne vaali yachika ko khaarij karte hue nyaayamurti pradeep nandrajog or nyaayamurti deepa sharma kii peeth ne yah baaten kahin

 The tenure of the earlier government pushed the country into great darkness

 These ten years were very important in the beginning of the 21st century

 a ridiculous combination of opportunistic, contradictory grand alliance
 PM, BJP, NDA se takkar lene ke liye banaaya ja rahaa he

 Amit Shah also ruled out the possibility of a grand alliance during this period
 unhone (amit Shah)kaha ki vipaksh ke paas philhal netritv kii kami he

 aise main kaaryakartaaon ko josh main badhanaa chahie lekin hosh nahin khona chahie 
 Shah said that the BJP wants a grand Ram temple to be constructed at the same place as soon as possible and there is no dilemma in it
 rahul gandhi par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha ki kuch samay se jo swayan jamaanat par hai, jin par inakam tex kaa 600 karod rupye bakaayaa ho, aise log modi ji par bhrashtachar kaa aarope laga rahe hai

 The Indian Labor Organization has called it an election budget with big promises
 bhartiya majdoor sangh ke mahasachiv brijesh upaadhyaay ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet main bataaya ki iskar main koi chhot nahin mili he
 Also, the proposals for raising money from the market for rural banks directly means that the government is in a mood to stop helping these banks
 majdoor or kisaanon ke liye to is bajet main kuch khaas nahin he
 The government is talking about the focus on farmers, but the welfare of the middle and lower middle class is not visible at the moment

 It is considered a very important series for India in terms of World Cup
 aise main bhartiya ballebaajon kaa sangharsh uske liye acchhee baat nahin hai
 The Indian top order collapsed in the first match
 lekin, kedaar jadhav or mahendra singh dhoni ne shatkeey saajhedaari kar team ko jeet dilaai thi
 In the second match, captain Virat Kohli's bat thundered
 kohli ne tisare match main bhi shandaar ballebaaji kii or apane vanade kariyar kaa 41waan shatak jamaaya
 Talking about Indian batsmen, only Kohli is in a rhythm and is scoring continuously
 unke baad jadhav hai jo is siries main balle se acha kar rahe hai
 Dhoni had played well in the first match
 lekin, baaki ke do maichon main vifal rahe the
 Now that the BCCI has made it clear that Dhoni will rest in the last two odis

 Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan are also not in good form
 aise main bhartiya ballebaaji kohli ke ird gird hi he
 While India have done well in bowling, the third match was an exception, which has however revealed how much trouble the batsmen can face if the Indian bowlers fail
 ranchi main bhartiya gendbaajon ne acchhee shuruyaat nahin kii thi, lekin ant ke overon main vaapasi karte hue australia ko ek vishaal score tak jane se roak diya tha
 While Kuldeep Yadav weakened Australia with three wickets, Jaspreet Bumrah, Mohammed Shami spent less runs in the end overs
 shami ke bhi is match main khilne par andeh he
 In his place, Bhuvneshwar Kumar can get a place in the team
 bhubaneshwar team main aate hai to deth overon main bharat or majboot ho jaaegi
 On the other hand, if Australia is talked about, then the third match can be an eye-opener for him
 tisare match main mehmaan team ne bataaya ki agar vah dhairya or sujh-boojh se khele to apane pradarshan main acha sudhaar kar sakaaratmak parinaam hasil kar sakati he
 His biggest advantage from the third match is skipper Aaron Finch's poor form
 lagbhag 10 maichon main ranon kaa sookhaa jhelane vaale finch ne aakhirkaar ranchi main 93 ranon kii pari khel apni form waapas hasil kii jo bharat ke liye chita kaa vishay ho sakati he
 Khwaja was also successful in turning a good start into a big innings
 unhone apane vanade kariyar kaa pehla shatak jamaaya tha
 Glenn Maxwell's bat also went well
 lekin, wo dhoni kii chapaltaa ke saamne kuch nahin kar paae the
 But, the middle order disappointed the team
 shaun marsh, peter hendscomb acchhee shuruyaat kaa phayda nahin uthaa paae the
 Marcus Stoinis and Alex Carry were successful in taking the team to 300 crosses in the last over
 lekin, us score tak team ko nahin pahunchaa paae the jahaan tak team jane vaali thi
 In bowling, Adam Jampa has impressed in the last two matches

 My director and the writers who write the story of films, what has happened to you nowadays? You would have made love story, but by coming to the end, instead of joining the hero-heroin, you kill one of the two
 aakhir ho kya gaya he aapako
 Why do not you let the two loving hearts meet
 hamaare hindi filmon ke itihaas main hero-herine ke dushman vaise hi koun se kam the, jo aap log unki jaan ke peeche pad gaye ho
 Sometimes Prem Chopra spread thorns in the path of lovers with his clever tricks, and sometimes Mogambo became happy and the lives of lovers dried up
 shaakaal ne bhi kam julm nahin dhaai do pyaar karne vaale dilon par
 Not many days have passed since Pran Saheb's death, but God forgive, because of his deeds, a lot of baddies have come out of the hearts of lovers
 tiger ajit ko koi kaise bhul saktaa he
 Life has not even avoided beating the lovers
 lalita pavaar ne kabhi saas to kabhi kuch banakar bete ke pyaar yani apni bahu par jo julm dhaae wo parde se baahar bhi nikal aae

 vaise ek baat bataaun hamaare hero in villenon se paar paa kar apni heroin ko le ude, lekin aap to sach main bade vaale ho yaar!kuch saal pehle 'gajini' film dekhi thi
 When i came out of the hall after watching the film, i was suffering the same sorrow, Man Sanjay Singhania could not tell his girlfriend Kalpana his truth and she died
 haal ke dinon main teen filmein dekhi hai or yahaan par bhi aap logon ne dard ko dil kii gaharaai main shul kii tarah utaar diya
 When you saw 'ranjhana' here, you killed her when the hero could have found his girlfriend, who had been molesting the heroine throughout the film
 film 'luteraa' main pyaar ek baar phir se paravaan chadhataa lekin usase pehle hi lekhak sahab ne aapni puraani filmon ke jaj kii tarah apni kalam kii nonk tod di
 The third film, which gave the most grief after 'ghajini' was 'aashiqui-2'
 aapaki to najar, niyat or dimag sab kuch kharaab he
 In the first one, 'aashiqui', after enduring all the sorrows and pain in the end, the hero-heroin meets, then a flower of love starts blooming in the heart of every youth
 lekin aapako dusron kii khushi kahaan acchhee lagati he? 'aashiqui-2' main sab kuch acha chal rahaa tha, heroin pal-pal hero kaa saath de rahi thi, hero ne bhi sudharne kaa vaada kar liya tha, lekin aapane use samudr main kuda diya
 Look, don't take the baddies of lovers
 aashiquon kii badduaen bahut buree hoti hai
 You must have heard the couplet of Kabir Das - Do not persecute the weak, so thick
 mari khaal kii saans se, loh bhasma ho jaay

 The secret of TV actress Pratyusha Banerjee's death is deepening
 uski laash ghar main pankhe se lataki hui thi
 And most importantly, Pratyusha had a vermilion mark on her forehead
 aakhir kya raaj he is sindur ke peeche
 Pratyusha, whose name was vermilion filled in his demand
 bwoyfriend se jhagada or uski bhoomika ko lekar bhi sawaal uth rahe hai
 What is the suspense of vermilion and suicide? chote parde par anandi kaa kirdaar nibhaakar mashhoor huipratyusha banerjeeko tivi sho main maathe par sindur lagaae aapane kai baar dekha hoga
 Pratyusha may have played the role of married couple in the serial, but Pratyusha was not married in real life
 pratyusha kii maut ke baad ek chaunkaane vaali baat saamne ai he ki jis vakt pratyusha kii laash ko ceiling fain se neeche utaara gaya tha
 At that time there was vermilion on his forehead
 police or uske doston ne jab wo sindur dekha to har koi hairaan rah gaya
 There was only one question in front of everyone, why was there vermilion on Pratyusha's forehead before marriage
 kya he pratyusha ke maathe par sindur kii mistry
 Pratyusha's body was first seen by her lover Rahul Raj
 or wo rahul hi tha jo pratyusha kii laash ko lekar aspataal pahunchaa tha
 While the guard of the society in Andheri West area where Pratyusha lived, according to his guard Srinath, there was a lot of quarrel between the two
 is puure maamle main rahul raaj singh kii bhoomika par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Pratyusha's fellow artists believe that Rahul Raj should not have been there
 abhinetri tina datta ne bhi rahul kii bhoomika par sawaal uthaaya he
 People from the film and television world who know Pratyusha and her family clearly say that Pratyusha was a very courageous girl and was not one to give up on life
 wo is tarah seatmahatyanaheen kar sakati
 The police also turned the investigation into the first thing towards Rahul
 use poochtacha ke liye thane main bulaayaa gaya he
 There are reports of him being taken into custody
 lekin mumbai police kaa kahana he ki rahul unke saath he or ve uskaa bayaan le rahe hai
 The police also asked Rahul the same question as to why Pratyusha committed suicide
 police ke saamne yah baat bhi nikal kar aa rahi he ki pratyusha ne aatmahatya karne se thik pehle phone par rahul se baat kii thi
 And perhaps this is the reason that Rahul had reached the opportunity-first incident
 aise main rahul par sawaal uthanaa laazmi tha
 But the secret of the mystery of the always happy Pratyusha's death is still intact
 pratyusha ke sambandh uske bwoyfriend rahul ke saath thik nahin the
 There was also a dispute between the two
 to aise main maut se thik pehle pratyusha ke maathe par bina shaadi ke hi kiske naam kaa sindur laga tha
 Police is currently trying to find answers to all these questions

 com / 9infh9pcru — Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) July 16, 2019 Last year Karikulam was inaugurated by the Buddhist guru Dalai Lama
 dilli ke shiksha mantri manish sisodiya ne apane aadhikarik twitor handle se twit kar utsav kii jaankaree di thi
 He was met by the Meghalaya Education Minister in the Happyness class
 kamalnath sarkaar main mantriyon ke liye mukhyamantri ne anaupchaarik guideline jari kii he
 It has been named the Code of Conduct for Ministers
 vaise to isamen kai saare niyam hai jo mantriyon ke liye banaae gaye hai
 But the advice of ministers to be careful with the media has created controversy
 congress jahaan ek taraf ise anushaasan bataa rahi he to vahiin bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne isaki kadi aalochana kii he
 Congress, which came to power in Madhya Pradesh after 15 years, does not want to get into disputes due to the statements and behavior of its ministers
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki kamalnath sarkaar ne apane sabhi mantriyon ke liye anaupchaarik disha-nirdesh jari kiye hai
 In this guideline, many types of advice have been given to ministers
 masalan wo janata, patrkaar, sarkari karmchaaree-adhikariyon yaa saarvajanik kaaryakramon or jagahon main kis tarah kaa vyavhaar karen
 But in the same guideline, ministers have also been advised to be careful with journalists
 mantriyon ke liye disha-nirdeshis anaupchaarik guideline main mantriyon ko kaha gaya he ki patrkaar aajkal apane mobile camaron se hi baatcheet or bayaan record kar lete hai
 So please communicate carefully in the presence of mobile
 mantriyon se kaha gaya he ki samvedansheel maamalon main nijee raay dene se bachein
 Your statement may cause controversy
 media or virdohi dal ko aise avasaron kii talash rahati he
 It also states that talk to journalists only on their own or staff phones as many phones have automatic recording which can be misused later
 patrakaron se jab bhi milen alag se milen
 Do not meet journalists in front of workers or officers and employees
 sarkaar ke jansampark mantri ne is guideline ko mukhyamantri kamalnath kaa anushaasan bataaya he
 He says that the train runs on a straight track until then it is fine or else an accident happens
 mantri pisi sharma ne 'aajataj' se kaha, 'kamalnath ji hamaare mukhiya hai or unako aisa lagata he ki or positive hona chahie kyonki unki khud kii kaaryastylee bahut hi saaf he
 He does not get into any kind of controversy
 anushaasan jaisaa unamem he vaisaa sab main ho
 Not afraid of journalists, but talking to journalists carefully has increased your respect
 aisi koi baat naa ho jisase galat sandesh jaae
 We just want a good image among the public
 railgadee sidhe-sidhe chale agar agar idhar udhar hogi to accident ho jayega
 The guidelines issued to the ministers also mention that they have to give a statement carefully
 saarvajanik jagahon par maryaada main rahanaa he or vahaan aparaadhik pravritiyon ke vyaktiyon ke saath manch saajha nahin karnaa he
 While making a statement on camera, take care of the language and keep your words in less words
 iske alaava soshal media par bhi bina sach jane post karne yaa use forward karne se bachane kii salaah di gai he
 BJP has clearly shown that the BJP has taken a dig at the government for the guidelines issued for the ministers
 shivaraj sarkaar main mantri rahe umashankar gupta ne kaha ki unki sarkaar main aisi koi roak nahin thi
 Why cut down on talking to the media when the government is not wrong
 gupta ne kaha, 'yah jo baaten kahi gai hai kahin naa kahin to paardarshita sarkaar main honi chahie
 An attempt has been made to stop him
 patrakaron par baat karne se pratibandh lagaana prajatantr kaa bahut bada makhul he
 Absolutely dictatorial attitude is what you want to speak
 vahi sab bole yaa satya satya ko janata ke saamne nahin aane dena chaahate hai
 You do not trust your ministers
 unke aacharan par bharosa nahin he
 If your work is transparent, there is no corrupt conduct, then why do you shy away from the media
 bijepi main kisi mantri ko media se baat karne kii roak nahin thi balki mukhyamantri khud kehete the ki media ke bich main rahanaa chahie'
 This is not the first time in the Kamal Nath government when a wall has been erected between ministers and the media
 isse pehle bhi ek aadesh jari kar 28 main se sirf 7 mantriyon ko hi sarkaar ne media se baat karne ke liye adhikrut kiya tha jis par kaaphi vivaad bhi hua tha
 The World Bank has advised the Government of Pakistan to accept India's proposal on the Kishanganga Dam dispute
 pakistan is vivaad ko international court panchat main lekar gaya he jahaan bharat ne ek nishpaksh export kii niyukti kaa prastaav diya he
 Now the World Bank says that Pakistan should accept India's proposal, retreating into the matter
 pakistan lagaataar yah kahata aayaa ki kishanganga baandh kaa nirmaan 1960 ke sindhu jal samjhaute kaa ulanghan he
 It argues that this project will not only affect the water level of rivers flowing in Pakistan but will also change the direction of rivers
 isi vajah se pakistan is maamle ko international court main lekar pahunchaa he
 On the other hand, India believes that the arguments Pakistan is making do not fit into the issue and hence a proper expert should be appointed in this matter
 sutron se pataa chalaa he ki pakistan is maamle main bharat kaa prastaav maanane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Because he feels that this may cause him to lose his favor in the International Court of Justice and close all the doors of arbitration
 saath hi anya maamalon main jab bhi bharat or pakistan ke bich koi bhi vivaad paidaa hoga to isi tarah ke nishpaksh visheshgy ke jariye vivaad ko sulajhane kii koshish kii ja sakati he
 In December 2016, the President of the World Bank told Pakistan that it was not ready for intervention in this matter
 is par pratikriya dete hue pakistan ne vishwa bank ko uski bhoomika yaad dilaate hue kaha tha ki vah mudde par thaharne ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Pakistan felt that if this issue was hanged, India would have completed the construction of Kishanganga Dam in such a time
 haal kii main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ore se kishanganga pariyojna ke udghaatan baad bhi pakistan ne isapar aapatti jataai thi
 But the World Bank rejected the objection, refusing to intervene in the case
 aapako bataa den ki 1960 ke sindhu jal samjhaute ke ulanghan kaa aarope lagaate hue pakistan ne is pariyojna kii shikaayat lekar vishwa bank pahuntaa he
 The neighboring country here asked the World Bank to monitor the project
 is baat par sahmati nahin ban pai lekin vishwa bank ne pakistan se yah vaada jarur kiya he ki vah is masale par donon deshon se baat karata rahegaa

 com / pizbi8mayf uddhav thakare bole- manishankar ayyar ko juuton se peeta janaa chahieshivsena pramukh bole- rahul gandhi bevakoof hai or ab unke paas bahut samay hashivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne congress netaa manishankar ayyar par vivaadit bayaan diya he
 Thackeray said, 'mani Shankar Aiyar should be beaten with shoes
 ' iske alaava unhone congress ke purv adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko lekar bhi hamalaa bolaa he
 Uddhav Thackeray said about Rahul Gandhi, 'rahul Gandhi is stupid and now he has a lot of time
 pradhanmantri banane kii koshish karne se pehle unhen desh ko samajhane kii koshish kerani chahie
 'uddhav Thackeray is believed to have made this statement in the context of Veer Savarkar
 manishankar ayyar kai baar vir saavarkar ko lekar vivaadit bayaan de chuke hai
 Uddhav Thackeray recently said that those who do not follow the ideology of Veer Savarkar should be beaten in public
 dilli uniwarsity ke north campus main vir saavarkar kii murti par kaalikh potne par uddhav thakare ne kaha tha ki maharashtra ke sammanit shaks saavarkar kaa apmaan karne waalon kii saarvajanik pitayee se unhen swatantraaa kaa mulya samaj main aayega
 Those who do not respect Savarkar should be killed once in public
 unhone kaha tha ki jinhone saavarkar kaa apmaan kiya, jisamen rahul gandhi bhi shaamil hai, unhen swatantraaa kaa mulya nahin samaj aayega
 Bal Thackeray had run the shoes: When Mani Shankar Aiyar was Petroleum Minister in 2004, he showed courage to insult the freedom fighter, as well as the Congress government removed the placards bearing the statement of Veer Savarkar from Andaman Cellular Jail
 tab shivasena pramukh bal thakare ne juute maaro abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 The Shiv Sena has been very sensitive and emotional since the beginning
 ayyar ke is bayaan par hua tha vivadasaal 2018 main vir saavarkar par die manishankar ayyar ke bayaan par kaaphi vivaad hua tha
 On his statement, his party, Congress, had also made a distance
 saavarkar par nishaanaa sadhate hue ayyar ne kaha tha ki 1923 main ek shaks ne (jise vidi saavarkar kehete the) aise shabd kii khoj kii jo kisi bhi dharmik pustak main maujuud nahin he- 'hindutv', is prakaar se do deshon ke siddhant kaa pehla samarthak, unka vaicharik guru he jo is samay bharat main satta main hai
