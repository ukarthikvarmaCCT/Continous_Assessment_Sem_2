 - Input IANS upabhoktaaon kii jeb kaatane ke alaava mahangaai va mobile par kol drop ke bich duusare bhi kai rishte hai
 Both are problems that do not require any major policy planning and state governments can be the biggest help to solve both which Prime Minister Narendra Modi calls his team India
 haal hi main kol drop kii samasya par pradhanmantri kaa dakhal, maamle kii pechidagi kaa saboot nahin tha balki is sawaal ko jameen de rahaa tha ki kuch hafton main puri duniya main yoga diwas kaa aayojan kara lene vaali sarkaar kya itani laachaar he ki buniyadi dhaanche kii behad adana-si samasya bhi thik nahin ho sakati?kol drop par sanchaar mantralay se piemo tak pahunchi charchaaon or korporate baithkon ko tatolte hue yah jaananaa katai mushkil nahin he ki kharaab mobile network kii samasya itani badi nahin he ki iske liye rajnatik sarvanumati kii jarurat ho yaa phir upabhoktaaon ko kharaab sarvice ke badale telephone bill par sabsidi dene kii jarurat aa pade
 Even if you do not have too much technology, it would be better to know the root and possible solutions of this problem so that mobile phones operate at frequencies from 300 mhz to 3000 mhz, although the entire range is not used in India
 
 mobile network kaa buniyadi siddhant he ki frequency kaa band jitna kam hoga, sanchaar utana hi sahaj rahegaa
 This is the reason that when the frequency (frequency) was allotted recently, the competition was more for the 900 mhz band
 lekin achche frequency (nichle) band main jagah kam he, isliye zyada companiyaan ise hasil karne koshish karti hai
 If a company has fewer good bands and more customers, then there will be a call drop i
e
 if the frequency road is full then the traffic will slow down
 lage haath mobile tower kii kami kii bahes kaa marm bhi jaan lenaa chahie jo ki telecom infrastracchar kaa buniyadi hissaa he
 5 to serve around 96 crore mobile subscribers in the country
 5 lakh tower hai
 Good means lower towers are needed for lower frequency band but more towers are required for 3G and 4G ie higher band service
 in buniyadi tathyon kii roshni main sarkaar or companiyon kii bhoomika parakhane par kisi ko bhi ehsaas ho jayega ki samasya badi nahin he, balki maamla sankalp, gambhirtha, samanvay kii kami or companiyon par dabaav banane main hichak kaa he, jisane bharat kii mobile kranti ko kasaiyla kar diya he
 First let's take a shortage of towers
 mobile seva companiyaan maanati hai ki network ko behatar karne or kol drop rokane ke liye philhal keval ek lakh toweron kii jarurat he
 Most of the towers in it are needed in metros
 desh ke har shahar or jile main centre va rajya sarkaron kii itani sampattiyaan maujuud hai jin par tower lagaae ja sakate hai
 Only a coordinated administrative order can work
 is saal farvari main isaki pahal bhi hui lekin teji se kaam karne vaala piemo ise raftaar nahin de sakaa
 Despite the governments of his or her allies in 12 states, if the Modi government cannot raise even a few hundred square feet of land or roofs for small towers, then the talk of Team India is just jumla
 prashasnic sankalp main doosraa jhol companiyon par sakhti ko lekar he
 Last year, the government called the spectrum auction its biggest success, bridging the lack of infrastructure for companies
 companiyon ko spectrum aapas main baantne kii chhot mil chuki he, ve apane tower par duusari company ko jagah de sakati hai
 They are also going to get an exemption to sell spectrum, but in doing all this, the PMO and the Communications Minister should show courage to ask the companies that if the use of voice network increased by 12 per cent from January 2013 to March 2015, then the companies would not be able to sell the network (BTS ) Why only 8 percent increase in capacity? The latest TRAI document on call drop showed that data network usage over 3G increased by 252 per cent in the last two years but companies increased the network by only 61 per cent
 spectrum ke liye companiyon kii oonchi boli se sarkaar ko rajasav mila or companiyon ko spectrum, jisase bazaar main unka moolyankan bad rahaa he, lekin upabhokta ko sirf kol drop va mahange bill mili hai
 The government is also unable to compel companies to tell them at least what is the proportion of network and consumers so that people do not take service of companies whose seats are full
 hamaare paas railway he jo na samay par chalati he or na paryaapt kshamta he
 Roads are bad but
 bijli network he lekin bijli nahin aati
 The Mobile Revolution is India's single most successful reform that has modernized India
 is kranti ko pehle ghotaalon ne daagi kiya or ab kharaab seva ise chaupat karne vaali he
 Prime Minister does not know how to create Digital India? If the telecom regulator tribunal's recent discussion paper on call drop is considered to be the basis, then the government is finding itself unable to fix the infrastructure challenge and strict on companies
 isaki bajaae upabhoktaaon ke bill main chhot dene ke vikalp kii taiyaari ho rahi he maano upabhokta acha network nahin balki main bill kami chaah rahe hon? upabhoktaaon ko acchhee seva chahie, kharaab seva par sabsidi nahin
 In such a situation, it is difficult to understand who is going to benefit by transporting the mobile in a condition like railway or electricity

 koyala mantri shriprakash jaiswal ne kaha ki sibiai dwaara maange gaye dastavejon kaa pataa lagane or unhen muhaiyaa karaane main unka mantralay koi kasar nahin chhodega
 Jaiswal said that an inter-ministerial Committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Under Secretary (coal) to investigate and trace the missing files
 koyala mantralay se mahatvapurn filon ke gaayab hone par rajyasabha main vipakshi sadasyon ke hangaame ke bich jaiswal ne yah bayaan diya
 He said, "some documents and applications could not be traced to the Ministry of Coal

 dekhen film'bajrangi bhaijan'kaa nayaa gaanaa 'bhar do jholii meri': In view of the growing attraction for the Congress's promise to waive farmers' debt in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections, the BJP has announced a plan for women and farmers of small and very small holdings
 party ko ummid he ki isse congress kii ore chunavi phaayde kaa bahaav ruk jayega
 The Congress manifesto says that 2 lakhs of state cooperatives and state-owned banks will be paid Rs
 tak ke krishi karj maaf kar die jaaenge
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi had announced in June that if the Congress government came to power, the debts of the farmers would be forgiven within ten days of the formation of the government
 rajya ke vibhinn hisson main kisaanon ke bich congress ke elaan ke prati badhate aakarshan kii khabaren aam hone lageen to 17 november ko jari bhaajapa ke ghoshnaa-patr, jise drushti-patr kaha gaya, main mahilaon or chote tathaa choti jot ke kaashtkaaron ke liye ghoshnaaon kaa ek alag se adhyay joda gaya
 In Bhopal in the presence of Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, the manifesto promised to give two-wheelers to girls who scored more than 75 per cent in the last school examination
 bhaajapa ne mahila jameen maalikon ko apane naam se registry karaane ke liye ekamusth rakam dene kaa vaada kiya
 The Nari Shakti Sankalp Patra has made about 50 announcements in favor of women
 bhaajapa ne yah bhi elaan kiya ki chote or choti jot ke kaashtkaar agar paidaavaar sarkaar ko nahin bechate hai to bhi use kharid ke mausam main prati quintal bonus diya jayega
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh said, "farmers of small and small holdings do farming for their maintenance
 unke paas itnaa nahin bachataa ki bech saken or is tarah unhen bonus nahin mil paata he
 Under the Krishi Samridhi Yojana, if such farmers sold their entire produce to the government, then i would give them a bonus equal to that entire yield
 '' matlab yah ki agar us jameen par prati acre upaj 18 quintal tay kii gai or prati quintal 265 ru
 Bonus is given and if the farmer sells his produce to the government, then the farmer will be given a bonus equal to the entire yield of his farm
 is tarah 2 acre khet vaale kisaan ko 363265 yani 9,540 ru
 Will meet
 rajya main kul 80 lakh kaashtkaaron main 60 lakh chote or choti jot ke kisaan hai
 Chauhan explained the reason for not being in favor of farm loan waiver, "I spent Rs 32,000 crore on farmers in a year
 kharch kiye tathaa kisi bhi or se zyada kiya
 i do not want to forgive the debt because it seems like a bailout
 uske badale main kisaanon ko adhik upaj paidaa karne ko protsaahit karnaa chahta hum
 "it is not easy for the farmers of small and small holdings to understand the bjp's promises and then Chauhan has no time left to explain them properly
 alabatta ve ise har jagah dohraane main koi kotahi nahin barat rahe hai
 On November 17, at rallies in Javad in Neemuch and Malhargarh and Garoth assembly constituencies of Mandsaur, Chauhan elaborated his plan for small and small holdings
 mandsaur main 2017 main kisaan andolan main police firing main 6 kisaanon kii maut ho gai thi
 By the way, there is a lot of interesting speculation about debt waiver why the BJP did not declare debt waiver in Madhya Pradesh
 piemo ne saaf kar diya he ki koi bhaajapa shasit rajya karjamaafee kaa elaan nahin karegaa
 However, no one is willing to say this publicly
 isaki aanch sirf madhya pradesh main hi nahin, chhattisgarh main bhi mahasoos kii ja rahi he
 Congress has announced debt waiver in Chhattisgarh
 kul 77 lakh kisaanon ko kisaan credit card jari kiye gaye hai, jinamein 53 lakh rajya sahakaarita bank ke hai or baaki sarkari bainkon ke hai
 Co-operative banks made a total of Rs 12,000 crore in 2016-17
 kaa karj diya
 The small and small holdings that Chouhan is putting a lot of stress on, he also got about Rs 5,630 crore from the government
 kaa karj sarkaar se mila he
 The state government has been providing reservation for women in the past like Ladli Laxmi and reservation in panchayats, urban bodies and government jobs
 to, kya is baar mahilaon or chote tathaa choti jot ke kisaanon ke liye ghoshnaaen karj maafee kaa kaat kar paaengi? jawaab to nateezon ke baad hi milegaa

 com / rgsnbmmund a creepy video of Rajsamand from Rajasthan surfaced on social media a few days ago, in which a darinda lashes out an innocent in the name of love jihad
 phir use zindaa jala detaa he
 He recorded all this on camera
 phir wo video main elaan karata he ki ye sab usne lav jihad ke khilaaf kiya he
 But in the investigation that has now been revealed in the police investigation, the story turns out to be something else
 darasal, lav jihad to bas drama tha, us darinde kaa asli makasad kuch or hi tha
 The attempt to hide the crime under the guise of love jihad, that video of Rajsamand was heartbreaking, went viral on the Internet on December 7 last year
 haalanki katl usne 6 disambar ko kiya tha
 After the murder, he himself posted the video on social media
 iske baad hi police ko is katl kii jaankaree mili
 He later posted a video on social media before his arrest
 is baar video main wo khud ko sarender karne or lav jihad ke khilaaf aane kii baat kah rahaa tha
 But his real plot was something else
 wo darinda ek khaufnak yojana ko amali jama pehanaane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 How can anyone forget the dreadful pictures of the murder of humanity? bhoolanaa bhi nahin chahie
 Rather, for this painful incident, that poor should be punished so that he becomes a Nazir
 taaki koi phir aisa na kar paae
 Because on December 6 last year, this baron of Koshumbhunath Raiganam had not only killed Afrajul, but he had also given a humanitarian relief by pouring oil
 sahanubhuti ke liye lav jihad kaa drammpani is darindagi ke baad bhi logon kii sahanubhuti paane ke liye shanbhu ne is video main ise lav jihad kaa jama pahanaaya tha
 But after 36 days of Afrazul's murder, Shambhu's hypocrisy was exposed
 police chargeshit main shanbhu kaa ek-ek paap khul kar saamne aa gaya
 On Friday evening, the police has presented a 413-page charge sheet in the main judicial magistrate court, exposing every crime of the victim in the charge sheet
 68 sabooton vaali is chargeshit main police ne do logon ko mukhya gavaah banaaya
 Shambhunath's 15-year-old nephew, who is also an eyewitness in the case, became the first prime witness of the crime
 duusari mukhya gavaah bani wo ladki jisase shanbhu ke najayas sambandh hai
 Shambhu was afraid of slander
 Now the question is why Shambhunath, who belongs to the royalty of Rajasthan, killed Afrazul with this ruthlessness
 to suniye, jisane apane is dardanaak video se puure desh main khauf bhar diya wo khud darasal khauf main tha or use rajsamand main hi rahane vaali ek ladki ke saath khud ke avaidh sambandhon ke saarvajanik hone par badanaami kaa dar tha
 Friends were being hindered in Ayyashi, the conspiracy-related conspiracy of illegal sex with a girl was also known by Afrajul and his two friends from West Bengal, Ajju and Ballu Sheikh
 bas uski ayyashi main aadchan bane in teen logon ko shanbhu apane raste se hataanaa chahta tha
 The 413-page police charge sheet contains many evidence and reasons for the murder that reveal that Shambhu, who accused Afarzul of love jihad, is actually a bloody dagger
 shanbhu ne isliye kiya begunaah kaa qatlapulice chargeshit ke mutabik shanbhu ke pashchim bengal kii rahane vaali ek ladki ke saath najayas sambandh the
 For almost a year, he used to forcibly enter an illicit relationship with her in a house
 pashchim bengal ke hi rahane vaale us ladki ke do saathi bablu or ajju ko shanbhu ke is najayas sambandh ke bare main pataa tha
 With whom he often had a quarrel with this on mobile
 shanbhu ko dar tha ki bablu or ajju uskaa raaj khol sakate hai
 Then the question is why did Shambhu target Afrazul
 darasal shanbhu ko shaq tha ki baar baar mobile number badalane ke baad bhi bablu or ajju ke paas uskaa number is vajah se pahunch jaataa he kyonki uske nae number afrazul un tak pahunchaata he
 The dreaded conspiracy of the killer Shambhunath, in fear of his secret being revealed, Shambhu was furious
 usne ajju or bablu ko maarane kii sajeesh rachi thi
 But killed Afrazul
 police ko shanbhu kii ek diary mili he, jisamen vaardaat ke baad banaaye gaye video main istemaal shabdon ko likhaa gaya tha
 That is, what Shambhu had decided beforehand in the video
 lekin vaardaat ke rose ajju or ballu uske haath nahin lage
 So with the intention of creating fear in them, he targeted Afrazul
 taaki baaki log dar ke maare rajsamand chhodkar bengal waapas laut jaaen
 Police has collected 68 evidence against Shambhu Police has collected a total of 68 evidence against Shambhu from many other places including chance-e-crime
 inamen afrajul kii hatya main istemaal kii gai genti, dhaaria, genti kaa tutaa hua danda, petrol kii khaali bottle, maachis, mobile, afrajul kii ad jali idi, kapade, rupee, mobile samet afrajul kii bike, vaardaat ke dauraan pahane shambhu ke kapade, juute, skuti, doctoron kii postmortem report, shambhu ke doston or doctoron ke bayaan, ladki or shanbhu ke bhaanje kaa bayaan or ennesail report shaamil hai
 According to the police chargesheet, Shambhu had given training to the nephew to give a live video of the murder, he had given training to his nephew
 video banaate vakt bhaanja dare nahin isliye wo aksar use bali dene vaale video dikhaaya karata tha
 According to police, Shambhu had made eight videos of the nephew before and after the crime
 kai dinon tak kii hatya kii reharsalapulice ke mutabik vaardaat se kareeb do maheene pehle hi shanbhu ne hatya main shaamil kiye gaye hathiyaar kharid liye the
 On December 5, Shambhu had made five videos related to this incident
 wo lagaataar is hatya kii sajeesh ko amali jama pehanaane ke liye abhyaas kar rahaa tha
 In this way, the police revealed the real face of the pauper who was trying to hide his crime behind Love Jihad under the guise of religion
 lekin gunaahagaar chaahe kitna bhi shaatir kyon na ho, wo kanoon ke shikanje se nahin batch paata

 This is an address that appears repeatedly in the central government's list of yoga camps
 www
 ccryn
 org par clic karenge to desh ke 191 zilon main yoga shivi chalaane kii zimmedaari ramdev kii sanstha ko di gai he
 For this, the government had invited applications from the institutions engaged in the work of yoga, the last date of which was 8 May
 The Central Council for Research in Yoga & Naturopathy kii website par jab gaya to pataa chalaa ki desh ke sabhi zilon main maheene bhar ke liye yoga shivi lagaaye jane hai
 For this, the government will also provide a support amount of Rs 1 lakh
 website par form to he, magar kin sansthaaon ne jamaa kiya or kis aadhaar par chayan hua isaki koi soochna nahin he
 Yet it is surprising that if you create an image by looking at this list about that country where there are countless yoga institutes, then it would be that if there was no Ramdev, International Yoga Day would not have been made
 tippaniyan This is also a truth, but it is not the same truth
 ramdev ne zarur yoga ko kuleen sethon kii sangat main baithne vaale guruon kii paant se nikaal kar gaanv-gaanv tak pahunchaaya he lekin hamaare desh main or bhi kai choti-badi sansthaaen yoga ko lekar kaam kar rahi hai
 Had he got the help of one lakh from the government, the basis of yoga would have been stronger
 ek shivi ke liye ek lakh kii raashi se ramdev ko khaas fark nahin padegaa lekin yoga ke zariye sarkaar se unke sambandh or majboot to hote hi hai
 a few days ago, on the 'aaj Tak' channel, when Ashok Singhal asked Ramdev why he was silent on black money, he said that let June 21 pass
 to kya nahin bolne kii keemat par hi ramdev ko 191 shiviron kii zimmedaari di gai he
 For this, the government will also give them 191 lakh rupees
 haalanki yah saaf nahin he ki ramdev ne yah rakam lee he yaa nahin
 a list of 651 centers has been prepared on the Central Government website, out of which 24 places are vacant
 191 yoga shivi ramdev ke hisse main aae hai
 At number two is the 'person Development Center' of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, which has got 69 camps
 ab shri shri ravishankar ke liye 69 lakh kya chiz hai isliye paisa to kaaran nahin ho saktaa he
 But through these two institutions, is there a Yoga Cartel in the country? cartil kaa matlab kuch khaas logon kaa samooh jinke sambandhon ke daayre main sansadhano kaa bantwaaraa ho jaataa he
 There is nothing special for the common man
 meri taraf se sansthaaon ko ginaney main maamuli chook ho sakati he
 But a difference of not more than one or two will not come
 kul milakar teen sansthaaon ko 271 shivi mili hai
 Isha Foundation of Sadhguru has been given only 11 camps
 sadguru bhi kaaphi lokapriy hai
 She recently saw a poster with Kiran Bedi in Delhi
 sadguru corporate kii duniya main kaaphi maanya vyakti hai

 Outside India, their institutions also run in many countries
 brahm kumariz ko koun nahin jaanata
 His Raja Yoga is very popular
 kai channelon par inkaa kaarykram dekha bhi jaataa he
 Their organization is in every corner of the country
 phir bhi brahm kumariz ko sirf teen shivi di gai he
 It should be found out whether these institutions had applied for 11 and 3 only or why their applications were rejected in front of Patanjali
 iske alaava ujjain yoga life sosayadi ko paanch, es di em college aaf nechuropathy and yogic sciensez ko saat shivi mili hai
 It is expected that people are being told in the advertisements that so-and-so in the district is given the responsibility of running a yoga camp for a month, you can go there and get yoga training
 sarkaar ke is faisle se yoga ko lekar kaam karne vaali choti sansthaaon main asantosh to hai magar koi bolnaa nahin chahta
 It is also a rule of the business world of gurus that no one speaks against anyone
 ramdev ke alaava kai bade guruon ne bhi loksabhaa chunaav main pradhanmantri kaa samarthan kiya tha or apane tareeke se prachaar bhi kiya tha lekin ramdev jitna raajnneetik prayaas kisi ne nahin kiya
 He also made political use of his organization in the Lok Sabha elections
 ek party bhi banaai thi prachaar ke liye jiskaa ab koi ata-pataa nahin he
 So has Ramdev got this reward? haal hi main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne aarope lagaaya tha ki antarrashtriya yoga diwas ke naam par sirf ramdev ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 Bihar Yoga School in Munger is being ignored
 zyaada logon kaa dhyaan is par nahin gaya
 But if you ask any yoga practitioner, he will tell how much Bihar Yoga School has contributed to take Yoga across the world
 pune ke guru aayangar kii bhi lokapriyata kam nahin hai
 But on the day of International Yoga Day, another institution in their city will organize a yoga camp on behalf of the government
 bihar ke munger main patanjali yoga peeth ko dene kaa kya matlab he jabaki vahaan bihar yoga vidhyalay ashram ke angan se ghar ke angan tak kaarykram chalaa hi rahaa he
 According to my information, the Bihar Yoga School had not even applied, but should not have respected this institution
 vahi haal pune kaa he
 Two organizations have been given responsibility there
 donon hi aayangar skool ke nahin hai
 There was a discussion in some media circles that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh wanted to shore up Ramdev on the pretext of Yoga Day
 darasal tabhi samaj gaya tha ki ramdev ko hi pramukhataa milegi
 Ramdev has done a lot for Prime Minister Modi
 pradhanmantri ne bhi ramdev kaa kaaphi maan rakhaa he
 The amount of 191 lakh rupees is not a big deal but in every respect, Ramdev is the only and only on the occasion of International Yoga Day

 Ramdev can be seen from the point of view of the people before 21 June

 This is also a truth, but it is not the same truth

 raaj kundra par sattebaazi ke aarope lag rahe hai or adaalat main maamla bhi chal rahaa he
 The committee of former Supreme Court justices RM Lodha and retired justices Ashok Bhan and RV Ravindran have to decide against Meiyappan of Chennai Super Kings and Kundra of Rajasthan Royals
 kahin aisa to nahin ki shilpa shetty isi bahaane koi nayaa ‘phiksasana’ kar rahi hai
 Shilpa Shetty's yoga video is very popular, but it would have been nice that this day would have been allowed to remain pure according to yoga
 guruon ko darkinar kar glamer ke naam par aaropee or vivaadit logon ko brands banaakar yoga kaa kitna bhala ho rahaa he is par vichaar karnaa chahie
 a list of 651 centers has been prepared on the Central Government website, out of which 24 places are vacant
 191 yoga shivi ramdev ke hisse main aae hai
 At number two is the 'person Development Center' of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, which has got 69 camps
 ab shri shri ravishankar ke liye 69 lakh kya chiz hai isliye paisa to kaaran nahin ho saktaa he
 But through these two institutions, is there a Yoga Cartel in the country? cartil kaa matlab kuch khaas logon kaa samooh jinke sambandhon ke daayre main sansadhano kaa bantwaaraa ho jaataa he
 There is nothing special for the common man
 meri taraf se sansthaaon ko ginaney main maamuli chook ho sakati he
 But a difference of not more than one or two will not come
 kul milakar teen sansthaaon ko 271 shivi mili hai
 Isha Foundation of Sadhguru has been given only 11 camps
 sadguru bhi kaaphi lokapriy hai
 She recently saw a poster with Kiran Bedi in Delhi
 sadguru corporate kii duniya main kaaphi maanya vyakti hai
 Speak English quite effectively
 desh ke satraa rajyon main isha foundation ke centre hai
 Outside India, their institutions also run in many countries
 brahm kumariz ko koun nahin jaanata
 His Raja Yoga is very popular
 kai channelon par inkaa kaarykram dekha bhi jaataa he
 Their organization is in every corner of the country
 phir bhi brahm kumariz ko sirf teen shivi di gai he
 It should be found out whether these institutions had applied for 11 and 3 only or why their applications were rejected in front of Patanjali
 iske alaava ujjain yoga life sosayadi ko paanch, es di em college aaf nechuropathy and yogic sciensez ko saat shivi mili hai
 It is expected that people are being told in the advertisements that so-and-so in the district is given the responsibility of running a yoga camp for a month, you can go there and get yoga training
 sarkaar ke is faisle se yoga ko lekar kaam karne vaali choti sansthaaon main asantosh to hai magar koi bolnaa nahin chahta
 It is also a rule of the business world of gurus that no one speaks against anyone
 ramdev ke alaava kai bade guruon ne bhi loksabhaa chunaav main pradhanmantri kaa samarthan kiya tha or apane tareeke se prachaar bhi kiya tha lekin ramdev jitna raajnneetik prayaas kisi ne nahin kiya
 He also made political use of his organization in the Lok Sabha elections
 ek party bhi banaai thi prachaar ke liye jiskaa ab koi ata-pataa nahin he
 So has Ramdev got this reward? haal hi main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne aarope lagaaya tha ki antarrashtriya yoga diwas ke naam par sirf ramdev ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 Bihar Yoga School in Munger is being ignored
 zyaada logon kaa dhyaan is par nahin gaya
 But if you ask any yoga practitioner, he will tell how much Bihar Yoga School has contributed to take Yoga across the world
 pune ke guru aayangar kii bhi lokapriyata kam nahin hai
 But on the day of International Yoga Day, another institution in their city will organize a yoga camp on behalf of the government
 bihar ke munger main patanjali yoga peeth ko dene kaa kya matlab he jabaki vahaan bihar yoga vidhyalay ashram ke angan se ghar ke angan tak kaarykram chalaa hi rahaa he
 According to my information, the Bihar Yoga School had not even applied, but should not have respected this institution
 vahi haal pune kaa he
 Two organizations have been given responsibility there
 donon hi aayangar skool ke nahin hai
 There was a discussion in some media circles that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh wanted to shore up Ramdev on the pretext of Yoga Day
 darasal tabhi samaj gaya tha ki ramdev ko hi pramukhataa milegi
 Ramdev has done a lot for Prime Minister Modi
 pradhanmantri ne bhi ramdev kaa kaaphi maan rakhaa he
 The amount of 191 lakh rupees is not a big deal but in every respect, Ramdev is the only and only on the occasion of International Yoga Day
 tivi par bhi shri shri ravishankar or sadguru jaggi dikhe magar bahut der se or bahut kam
 Ramdev can be seen from the point of view of the people before 21 June
 channel se lekar panel tak main vahi hai
 His energy is unmatched
 ve har channel par asana karte hue nazar aa rahe hai
 Do you know the name of International Yoga Day should also be Ramdev Day
 bharat main to ho hi saktaa he
 On the go, a comment and- The Prime Minister met Shilpa Shetty and also invited her on the occasion of Yoga Day

 The situation seems to be deteriorating once again due to the death of 70 people during the chemical attack in Syria
 syria kii grih vibhaag kii maane to unke yahaan iske baad missile atake kiya gaya he
 According to the Syrian media, Syria Air Defense on Monday dropped about 8 missiles
 sthaneey media ne is missile hamale kaa shaq america par jataayaa he
 Whereas the US has denied that he was involved in this attack
 media ke anusaar, central syria ke paas vaale ilaake main gharon ke aasapaas ye hamalaa hua tha
 It is reported that many people have died in this attack
 pentagon ne kaha he ki vah is samay syria main hamalaa nahin kar rahaa he
 He said that we are keeping an eye on the Syrian issue
 syria main homes ke tamphur vayusena adde par hamalaa aise samay main hua he jab shanivaar ko purvi ghouta main vidrohiyon ke garh par hue hamale ko lekar antarrashtriya str par aakrosh bad gaya he
 On the other hand, the European Union has said that there has been evidence indicating that the Syrian administration carried out chemical attacks in Douma and called on Syrian allies Russia and Iran to help prevent such attacks
 aapako bataa den ki syria main huechemical atacke baad america raashtrapati donald trump ne kadi chetavanee di thi
 Trump blamed Russia, Iran and Syrian President Bashar al-assad for this
 saath hi unhone kadi chetavanee di ki syria main chemical hamale main shaamil logon or deshon ko isaki baari keemat chukaani padegi
 US President Trump had warned in a tweet that many people, including women and children, were killed in a senseless chemical attack in Syria
 jahaan par chemical hamalaa hua, usko syrian sena ne chaaro ore se gher rakhaa he
 In such a situation, no one can reach there from outside the world
 is hamale ke liye asad (syria ke raashtrapati) kaa samarthan karne ke liye roosi raashtrapati vladimir putin, rus or iran jimmedaar hai
 They will have to pay a heavy price for this

 Two details related to the education of Smriti Irani, Minister of State for Human Resource in the Modi Government have come to light
 saal 2004 ke affidavit main smriti ko bie paas bataaya gaya he jabaki 2014 main unhen barahavin paas bataaya gaya he
 In fact, Smriti Irani contested from Chandni Chowk Lok Sabha seat of Delhi against Kapil Sibal in 2004

 According to that affidavit, Smriti completed her BA degree in 1996

 maakan ne twit kiya, 'rajyasabha ke record ke mutabik smriti graduate bhi nahin hai, lekin ab vah desh kii shiksha vyavastha kaa bhaar sanbhaalengi
 singhvi-digvijay took a pinch In the meantime, Irani's own affidavit alleging malfunctions gave the Congress an opportunity to take an aggressive stance once again
 congress pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne is par chutki lete hue kaha ki smriti kaa koun sa affidavit sahi he, yah sirf bijepi hi bataa sakati he
 Congress leader Digvijay Singh also lashed out at this and said that if PM finds Smriti Irani better than Murali Manohar Joshi, then it is her decision
 singhvi ne kaha ki unki party smriti irani par koi nijee hamalaa nahin kar rahi he
 This is a case of two different affidavits
 singhvi ne kaha ki smriti irani ne apane afidavit main galat jaankaree di he, jo ek aparaadh he
 Uma asked, what is the qualification of Sonia, however, retaliating on the allegations of Congress leaders, BJP leader and Union Minister Uma Bharti asked what is the educational qualification of Sonia Gandhi, who ruled the country for 10 years through remote control
 uma ne kaha, 'main congress raaj ke dauraan desh chalaane vaali sonia gandhi ke ajukeshan certificate dekhnaa chaahati hum
 Congress should show that and then talk further
 ' uma boleen ki sonia gandhi ko chahie ki vah apane congressiyon ko is mudde par chup karaaen

 The Indian team is slowly trying to recover from a humiliating defeat in the Gaul Test, but the team's senior most player in the finals is Harbhajan Singh, whose poor performance has led to many questions about his future
 match main 40 wicket gire or inamen se donon tiimon ke paanch visheshgy spinneron ne 31 wicket hasil kiye, lekin yahaan par aankada nishchit taur par harbhajan ko pareshaan karegaa, kyonki in 31 viketon main unke naam par keval ek wicket darj he
 For this, he also scored 90 runs in 25 overs
 bharat ke mukhya gendbaaj ravichandran aswin ne jahaan 10 wicket liye, vahiin amit mishra ne bhi donon pariyon main paanch wicket lekar apni jeevant upasthiti darj karai
 For Sri Lanka, Tharindu Kaushal took eight, while 37-year-old Rangana Herath improved to a disappointing first innings and took seven wickets in the second innings
 herath ne jahaan match main pasa palatney main ahm bhoomika nibhaai, vahiin harbhajan maidan par sangharsh karte hi najar aae
 Dinesh Chandimal left no stone unturned in the Indian attack with this off-spinner
 captain viraat kohli ne sweekaar kiya ki 'turbanetor' ne keval ek acha spel kiya, lekin iske baad unhone harbhajan kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki bich main ek samay aisa tha, jabaki chandimal ne prayek gendbaaj kii dhunaai kii
 Harbhajan was not looking in rhythm from the beginning and it started to look clear as the match progressed
 pehali pari main unhone aswin kii tulana main short length vaali genden kii tathaa angelo maithyuj or chandimal ne aasaani se unhen khelaa
 He failed to get a quick turn like Ashwin and had half his firepower compared to his teammate from Tamil Nadu
 tippaniyan If you compare Harbhajan to Herath, as both are almost the same age, the Sri Lankan spinner took a lot of lessons from the first innings and bowled very well in the second innings, but the Indian spinner could not do so
 herath ne match ke baad kaha tha, jab aap umradraj ho jate hai, to aapako anya kii tulana main kuch khaas karnaa hota he
 i have gained a lot of experience over the years
 yadi main kuch or sikh saktaa hum, to main uske liye taiyaar hum
 Hopefully, Harbhajan will take note of Herath's statement

 The comments yadi harbhajan kii herath se tulana karen, kyonki donon lagbhag samaan umr ke hai, to srilankai spinner ne pehali pari se sabak lekar duusari pari main bahut badhiya gendbaaji kii, lekin bhartiya spinner aisa nahin kar paaya
 Herath said after the match, when you get old, you have to do something special compared to others
 pichley kuch varshon main maine kaaphi anubhav hasil kiya he
 If i can learn anything else, I'm ready for that
 herath ke is bayaan par ummid he ki harbhajan gaur karenge

 Amarkant's stories provide a very impressive and intimate portrayal of the life experiences and life-styles of the middle class, especially the lower-middle class
 akasar sapaat-se najar aanevaale kathyon main bhi ve apane jeevant maanviya sansparsh ke kaaran anokhi abha paidaa kar dete hai
 The manner in which his stories with easy-to-understand rhetoric encompass the complexities of life, sometimes one has to be amazed by it
 lekin yah amarkant kii khaas style he
 Like Amarkant's personality, his language also has a special quality of fudge
 lok-jivan ke muhaavaron or deshaj shabdon ke prayog se unki bhashaa main maati kaa sahaj sparsh tathaa aisi sondhi gandh rach-bas jaati he, jo pathakon ko kisi chhadam udaattata se pare, bahut hi nijee lok main, le jaati he
 Normal situations also become very expressive due to the satire hidden in them
 amarkant ke vibhinn kahani-sangrahon main charitron kaa vishaal falak ‘jindagi or jonk’ se lekar ‘mitra milan’ tak failaa hua he
 Rajkamal Prakashan has published 'representative Stories' by collecting almost all the famous stories of those collections in one place
 kisi lekhak kii samast pratinidhi kahaniyon ke ek jagah uplabdh hone ke kaaran is sankalan kii upadeyata bhi kaaphi he
 Today, on the birth anniversary of Amarkant, a story from his compilation: 'lunch' - Amarkantasiddheshwari extinguished the stove after cooking and placed the head between the two knees and probably saw the toes or ants walking on the ground
 achaanak use maaloom hua ki bahut der se use pyaas lagi he
 She got up like a drunkard and returned from the gag and was gutted
 khaali pani uske kaleje main lag gaya or vah 'hai ram' kahkar vahiin jameen par let gai
 After staying in the same way for half an hour, he came to live
 vah baith gai, aankhon ko mel-malkar idhar-udhar dekha or phir uski drushti osaare main ad-toote khatole par soe apane chah varshiya ladke pramod par jam gai
 The boy was naked
 uske gale tathaa chaati kii haddiyaan saaf dikhaai detii thim
 His arms and legs were dry and lifeless like stale cats, and his stomach was puffed up like a pot
 uskaa mukh khulaa hua tha or us par anginat makkhiyaan ud rahi thi
 She woke up, put one of her ripped, dirty blouses on the child's mouth and after standing for a minute and a half, went out to the door and strolled the street in the garb of the door
 baarah baj chuke the
 The sun was very strong, and sometimes one or two people would pass through it with a towel or skull on their head or forcefully leaping with an umbrella taut
 das-pandrah minute tak vah usee tarah khadi rahi, phir uske chehre par vyagrata fail gai or usne aasmaan tathaa kadi dhoop kii ore chintaa se dekha
 After a moment or two, he moved towards the end of the street, moving far beyond the door of his head, then his elder boy Ramchandra slowly moved towards the house
 usne furti se ek lotaa pani osaare kii chaowkee ke paas neeche rakh diya or chauke main jaakar khaane ke sthaan ko jaldi-jaldi pani se lipane-potne lagi
 Putting the victim there, he turned his head towards the door that Ramchandra stepped inside
 ramchandra aakar dham-se chaowkee par baith gaya or phir vahiin bejaan-sa let gaya
 His mouth was red and elongated, his hair was disheveled, and his torn shoes were covered with rags
 siddheshwari kii pehle himmat nahin hui ki uske paas aae or vahi se vah bhaybheet hirani kii bhanti sir uchakaa-ghumaakar bete ko vyagrata se niharti rahi
 But, even after about ten minutes, when Ramchandra did not wake up, she panicked
 paas jaakar pukaara- ‘badku, badku, badku!' lekin uske kuch uttar na dene par dar gai or ladke kii naak ke paas haath rakh diya
 Breathing was going well
 phir sir par haath rakhkar dekha, bukhaar nahin tha
 Ramchandra opened his eyes with the touch of a hand
 pehle usne maan kii ore sust najaron se dekha, phir jhat-se uth baitha
 After removing the shoes and washing his hands and feet with the lotus water, he came to the post like a machine
 siddheshwari ne darate-darate poocha, "khaanaa taiyaar he
 What should i do here? "ramchandra asked while getting up," Babu ji has eaten? "siddheshwari replied running towards the foursome," You must be coming
 "ramchandra peede par baith gaya
 He was about twenty-one years of age
 lanbaa, dublaa-patala, gora rang, badi-badi ankhen tathaa honton par jhurriyaan
 He learned from his health in the office of a local daily newspaper as a proof reader
 pichley saal hi usne inter paas kiya tha
 Siddheshwari put the plate of food in front of him and started sitting near the fan
 ramchandra ne khaane kii ore darshanik kii bhanti dekha
 Yesterday two rotis, pan-dal pani dal and gram-fried greens
 ramchandra ne roti ke pratham tukade ko nigalate hue poocha, "mohan kahan he? badi kadi dhoop ho rahi he
 "mohan was the middle boy of Siddheshwari
 umr attharah varsh thi or vah is saal hiskool kaa privet imtahaan dene kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha
 He did not know when he was missing from the house and Siddheshwari himself did not know where he had gone
 kitu sach bolne kii uski tabiyat nahin hui or jhooth-mooth usne kaha, "kisi ladke ke yahan padhane gaya he, aata hi hoga
 His mind is very sharp and his health is kept in reading round the clock
 hameshaa usee kii baat karata rahata he
 "ramchandra did not say anything
 ek tukdaa munh main rakhkar bharaa gilaas pani pi gaya, phir khaane lag gaya
 He was breaking coffee into small pieces and chewing them slowly
 siddheshwari bhay tathaa aatank se apane bete ko ekatak nihaar rahi thi
 After a few moments, fearfully, he asked, "what happened there?" Ramachandra looked at his mother with his big heartless eyes, then bowed down and said something with a stance, "everything will be alright when the time comes
 "siddheshwari chup rahi
 The sun was getting more intense
 chote aangan ke aasmaan main badal main ek-do tukade paal kii naavon kii tarah tair rahe the
 The sound of a rattle aces was passing through the street outside
 or khatole par soe balak kii saans kaa khar-khar shabd sunai de rahaa tha
 Ramachandra, suddenly dissolving the silence, asked, "pramod has eaten?" Siddheshwari replied in a sad tone, looking at Pramod, "yes, ate
 ""royaa to nahin tha?"siddheshwari phir jhooth bol gai, "aaj to sachmuch nahin royaa
 He has become very smart
 kahata tha, badkaa bhaiya ke yahan jaaounga
 Such a boy
 
 
 "par vah aage kuch na bol saki, jaise uske gale main kach atak gaya
 Yesterday, Pramod had caught the insistence on eating Revdi and slept for an hour and a half after crying for it
 ramchandra ne kuch aashcharya ke saath apni maan kii ore dekha or phir sir nicha karke kuch teji se khaane laga
 When there was only one piece of bread left in the plate, Siddheshwari, undertaking to get up, asked, "I bring one more bread?" Ramachandra refuses by hand and says, "no, no, not at all
" meraa pet pehle hi bhar chukaa he
 i am going to leave this also
 bas, ab nahin
 "siddheshwari insisted," Only half right
 "ramchandra bighad uthaa, "adhik khilaakar biimaar daalane kii tabiyat he kya ? tum log jaraa bhi nahin sochati ho
 Just your stubbornness bhukh rahati to kya le nahin letaa?"siddheshwari jahaan-kii-tahaan baithi hi rah gai
 Ramachandra took the remaining pieces in the plate and looking at Lotte said, “bring water
 "siddheshwari lotaa lekar pani lene chali gai
 Ramachandra played the bowl with fingers, then placed the hand in the plate
 ek-do kshan baad roti ke takde ko dhire-se haath se uthaakar aankh se nihara or ant main idhar-udhar dekhne ke baad tukade ko munh main saralata se rakh liya, jaise vah bhojan kaa grass na hokar paan kaa bidaa ho
 The middle boy washed his hands and feet as soon as Mohan came and sat on the pedestal
 vah kuch saanwala tha or uski ankhen choti thim
 He had smallpox stains on his face
 vah apane bhai hi kii tarah dublaa-patala tha, kintu utana lanbaa na tha
 He looked more serious and depressed than he was in his age
 siddheshwari ne uske saamne thali rakhte hue prashn kiya, ''kahan rah gaye the betaa? bhaiya puch rahaa tha
 "mohan replied unnaturally while trying to swallow a large grain of bread," had gone somewhere
 yaheen par tha
 "siddheshwari sat there and fanned in such a way as if she was mumbling in a dream," Badka was praising you very much
 kah rahaa tha, mohan bada dimagi hoga, uski tabiyat choubison ghante padhane main hi lagi rahati he
 "saying this, he looked at his middle boy as if he had stolen something
 mohan apni maan kii ore dekhakar feeki hansee hans padaa or phir khaane main jute gaya
 He had cleaned three-fourths of the roti bowl and most of the vegetables from one of the two roti served
 siddheshwari kii samaj main nahin aayaa ki vah kya kare
 He was very scared of these two boys
 achaanak uski ankhen bhar ai
 She started looking at the other side
 thodi der baad usne mohan kii ore munh pheraa, to ladkaa lagbhag khaanaa samaapt kar chukaa tha
 Siddheshwari asked in shock, "I give you a roti?" Mohan looked towards the kitchen with mysterious eyes, then said in a dull tone, "no
 "siddheshwari ne gidgidaate hue kaha, "nahin betaa, meri kasam, thodi hi lo
 Your brother had taken a bun
 "mohan ne apni maan ko gaur se dekha, phir dhire-dhire is tarah uttar diya, jaise koi shikshak apane shishy ko samajhaata he, "nahin re, bas, awwal to ab bhukh nahin
 Then you have made rotis in such a way that they are not eaten
 na maaloom kisi lag rahi he
 Well, if you want, give some lentils in the bowl
 daal badi acchhee bani he
 "siddheshwari did not say anything and filled the bowl with lentils
 mohan katore ko munh se lagaakar sud-sud pi rahaa tha ki munshi chandrika prasad juuton ko khas-khas ghasitate hue aae or ram kaa naam lekar chaowkee par baith gaye
 Siddheshwari slid the sari slightly down on the forehead and went out fast after drinking Mohan Dal in one breath and taking a pot of water in his hand
 do rotiyaan, katoraa-bhar daal, chane kii tali tarkari
 The Munshi Chandrika Prasad was chewing each and every grass of the bread sitting on the pedestal in such a way as the old cow chews
 unki umr pantalis varsh ke lagbhag thi, ki pachaas-pachpan ke lagate the
 The body leather was dangling, the bald skull was shining like a mirror
 gandi dhoti ke upar apekshaakrit kuch saaf baniyaan taar-taar latak rahi thi
 Munshi ji, taking the bowl in his hand, while stirring the dal a little, asked, "doesn't it look bad?" Siddheshwari could not understand what had happened in her heart - as if something was cutting
 pankhe ko zaraa or jor se ghumaati hui boli, "abhi-abhi khaakar kaam par gaya he
 Was saying, in a few days a job will be done
 hameshaa, 'babu ji, babu ji' kiye rahata he
 Said Babu ji is like a deity
 "munshi ji ke chehre par kuch chamak ai
 Blushing asked, "an, what did you say that Babu ji is like a deity? He is very mad
 "siddheshwari par jaise nasha chadh gaya tha
 Like a frenzy of rage, she began to rave, "not crazy, very clever
" us jamaane kaa kaai mahatma he
 Mohan respects him a lot
 aaj kah rahaa tha ki bhaiya kii shahar main badi izzat hoti he, padhane-likhanewaalon main bada aadar hota he or badkaa to chote bhaaiyon par jaan detaa he
 He can bear everything in the world but cannot see that something happens to his pramod
 "munshi ji daal-lage haath ko chaat rahe the
 Looking at the front stare, he laughed and said, "barka's mind is very sharp, even though there was naughty boyhood
 hameshaa khel-kud main laga rahata tha, lekin yah bhi baat thi ki jo sabak main use yaad karne ko detaa tha, use barraak rakhata tha
 Actually, all three boys are very intelligent
 pramod ko kam samajhati ho" yah kahkar vah achaanak jor se hans pade
 Munshi ji was fighting with a grass after eating one and a half rotis
 kathinaayee hone par ek ek gilaas pani chadha gaye
 Then started coughing and eating
 phir chuppi chaa gai
 From far away the sound of a flour mill was being heard and a pandaku sitting on a nearby neem tree was continuously talking
 siddheshwari kii samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki kya kahe
 She wanted him to ask everything properly
 sabhi chijen thik se jaan le or duniya kii har cheez par pehle kii tarah dhadlle se baat kare
 But he did not dare
 uske dil main jane kaisaa bhay samaaya hua tha
 Now Munshi ji was eating quietly like this, as if he had been keeping silent fast for the last two days and going to break it somewhere this evening
 siddheshwari se jaise nahin rahaa gaya
 He said, "it seems, it won't rain anymore
" "munshi ji ne ek kshan ke liye idhar-udhar dekha, phir nirvikaar swar main raay di, "makkhiyaan bahut ho gai hai
 "siddheshwari expressed curiosity," Fufa ji is ill, no news came
 "munshi ji ne chane ke daanon kii ore is dilchaspee se drushtipaat kiya, jaise unase baatcheet karanevaale hon
 Then reported, "gangasharan Babu's girl's marriage is finalized
 ladkaa em
 a
 paas he
 "siddheshwari became silent
 munshi ji bhi aage kuch nahin bole
 Their food was finished and they were gleaning the remaining grains in the plate like a monkey
 siddheshwari ne poocha, "badkaa kii kasam, ek roti detii hoon
 There are many now
 "munshi ji ne patni kii ore apradhi ke samaan tathaa rasoi kii ore kanakhi se dekha, tatpashchaat kisi chote ustad kii bhaanti bole, "roti? rahane do, pet kaaphi bhar chukaa he
 He is also bored with food and salty things
 tumne vyarth hamen kasam dharaa di
 Well, i am taking it for granted
 gud hoga kya?"siddheshwari ne bataaya ki handiya main thodaa-sa gud he
 Munshi ji said with enthusiasm, "then i will drink some cold jaggery juice
 tumhaari kasam bhi rah jaaegi, jaayaka bhi badal jaayegaa, saath-hi-saath haajama bhi durust hoga
 Yes, it is a sore throat while eating bread
 " yah kahkar ve tahaakaa markar hans pade
 After Munshi's handling, Siddheshwari sat on the ground of the fours with her knicker plate
 bataloi kii daal ko katore main udel diya, par vah puraa bharaa nahin
 a little gram flour left in the lizard, pulled it close
 rotiyon kii thali ko bhi usne paas khinch liya
 There was only one bread left in it
 moti-bhaddi or jali us roti ko vah juthi thali main rakhane ja rahi thi ki achaanak uskaa dhyaan osaare main soe pramod kii ore aakarshith ho gaya
 He stared at the boy for a while, then divided the bread into two equal pieces
 ek tukade ko to alag rakh diya or duusare tukade ko apni juthi thali main rakh liya
 Thereafter a lota sat down to eat with water
 usne pehla grass munh main rakhaa or tab na maaloom kahan se uski aankhon se tap-tap aansu chune lage
 The whole house was buzzing with flies
 aangan kii algani par ek gandi sari tangi thi, jisamen paband lage hue the
 The two older boys were not known anywhere
 baahar kii kothri main munshi ji aundhe munh hokar nischitata ke saath so rahe the, jaise dedh maheene purv makaan-kiraaya-niyantran vibhaag kii clerkise unki chantni na hui ho or shaam ko unako kaam kii talash main kahin janaa na ho

 Amidst the Doklam controversy, China has once again directly targeted the Modi government
 sarkari akhbaar global times ne likhaa he ki modi sarkaar bharat ko jang kii ore dhakel rahi he
 The newspaper even said that in the event of war, the result is well known
 chini akhbaar ne likhaa ki doklam main bhartiya sena peeche nahin hati to yuddh tay he or jang hone par nateeja jagajaahir he
 Fearing the Chinese newspaper, their army has been described as the strongest in 50 years
 communist party ke akhbaar ke sampadakeey main likhaa gaya he ki modi sarkaar apane logon se jhooth bol rahi he ki 2017 vaala bharat 1962 se alag he
 The biggest difference between the forces of the two countries in the last 50 years
 agar modi sarkaar yuddh karnaa chaahati he to use kam se kam logon ko sachai bataani chahie
 China's 'small operation' against the Indian Army! Also, according to the news published in the newspaper, the Chinese Army can conduct a small operation against the Indian Army in Doklam in 2 weeks
 isamen yah bhi likhaa he ki china sarkaar is oparation se pehle bharat sarkaar ko jaankaree bhi degi
 India may be appealing for peace, but the Chinese media has witnessed a spate of inflammatory articles
 shanivaar ke lekh main research ne china kii ore se tibet main kiye sainya abhyaas kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya
 Researcher wrote that India has adopted an immature policy regarding China in recent years
 uske vikaas kii raftaar china ke str kaa nahin he
 India only wants a dispute in this area, which in reality has nothing to do with the dispute
 manshaa china ke saath saudebaaji karnaa he
 The newspaper said that the PLA had made adequate preparations for the military confrontation
 yuddh kii sthiti main parinaam jagajaahir he
 The Modi government should be aware of the strength of the PLA
 bhartiya seemaa par tainaat sainik piele kshetra balon ke liye koi pratidwandvi nahin hai
 In the event that the PLA is fully capable of eliminating all Indian troops in the border area
 akhbaar kaa ye sampadakeey aise samay main aayaa he, jab pichley hafte china kii taraf bharat se doklam se turant sena peeche karne ko kaha gaya he
 The newspaper said that China has exercised restraint, as well as demonstrating peace and respect for human life
 piele ne pichley maheene bhi koi karrwai nahin kii thi, jab bhartiya sainikon ne chini kshetra main bevajaah rup se ulanghan kiya
 If the Modi government continues to view China's goodwill as a weakness, then this carelessness will lead to destruction
 bharat saarvajanik rup se us desh ko chunauti de rahaa he jo takat main kahin zyada shreshth he
 The Chinese are shocked by India's negligence
 isse pehle china ke ek sainya visheshgy ne kaha ki unka deshdokalamase apane sainikon ko waapas nahin hataayega, kyonki agar vah aisa karata he to bharat ko bhavishya main uske liye samasya khadi karne kaa protsaahan milegaa
 Yu Dongshiyom, assistant professor at the International College of Defense of the National Defense University of the People's Liberation Army, said that if Indian strategists and policymakers think that China will return, they are making a mistake
 you dongshiom ne kaha ki bhartiya sainikon ko bina shart tatkaal waapas ho janaa chahie
 In Xinhua, China's official news agency, Yu wrote that Beijing would not withdraw troops from Doklam, as the region belongs to China, and the 1890 treaty between Britain and China is evidence of this
 unhone kaha, 'agar china abhi peeche hatataa he, to bharat bhavishya main or adhik samasyaayein paidaa karne ke liye protsaahit hoga
 There are many differences between Beijing and New Delhi on many borders, but Doklam is not included
 'agar china apni sena waapas bulaaegaa, to bharat bhi hataayegabharat ne kaha he ki agar china apni sena waapas bulaata he, to vah bhi apane sainikon ko vahaan se hataa legaa
 The Chinese expert said, "some Indian strategists and policymakers are in the misconception that China will return thinking that India can play an important role in vested interests, incomplete reforms in the People's Liberation Army and the sino-us strategy

 doklam ko lekar china ke sakht rukh ne bharat ke liye pakistan se lagati pashchimi seemaa ke saath-saath purvi seemaa par bhi mushkilen khadi kar di hai
 After a general skirmish on the border, the relationship between the two countries has reached such an extent that talks are being openly talked about
 arunachal pradesh ko lekar china or bharat samay-samay par ek-duusare par talkh hue hai lekin is baar padosi desh ne jo daanv chalaa he wo bharat ke liye isliye gambhir khatra he kyonki agar dragon apane makasad main kaamyaab rahaa to bharat ke liye apane purvottar hisse ko bachaana mushkil ho jayega
 What will be the effect? if the Chinese crisis spreads, it will take the 3488-km border area in the same way as the crisis on the 3323-km-long border with Pakistan, including Kashmir, always hovers
 china ne 62 ke yuddh main aksai chin ke 32 hajaar varg kilometre kii jameen par kabja kiya or pakistan ke saath 63 ke pact main china ke kabje vaale oxai chin se satee kareeb 5 hajaar varg kilometre jameen china ko de di

 "china's presence in Doklam critical Hadoklam may be more dangerous for India than Oxai Chin because the area of oxai Chin does not come in the middle of any other part of India but Doklam's area of bhutan comes in the middle of the entire North East ie Bhutan
 Doklam is so strategically important for India that if China builds its tanks there and then erects its tanks, then China is not just the entire North e Will look the same on the t but can take China to Pakistan like never Nepal or Bhutan's strategic policy and economy as well as its monitoring to rely on themselves Sikkim
 or bariki se agardoklam ke jariyeek taraf nepal or duusari taraf bhutan ke bich sikkim ke ilaake ko dekhen to ye ilaaka north east ke liye life line he kyonki pashchim bengal main darjeeling ke bagdogra hawaii adde par utarane ke baad sadak ke raste hi north east ke seven sistar se sampark hota he or agar dokalam ke baad jaraa bhi tirchhi najar sikkim par china daalega to jatke main bharat assam, meghalaya, arunachal pradesh, nagaland, manipur or tripura se cat jayega yani bangladesh ke jariye hi phir in rajyon tak pahunchaa ja saktaa he yaa phir pashchim bengal se samudri raste se tripura pahunchaa ja saktaa he

 Singh termed this election result as a danger bell for the BJP and stated aap's future plans

 We are focusing on building an organization at the booth level in the state
 '-input bhashaa Mahaparva Chhath has started, but in the name of Chhath, a market of loot is also flourishing from those who are trying to go to their house on this occasion
 rail main seat nahin he or bas main jane kii majaburi he
 Taking advantage of this compulsion, bus operators are charging triple fare
 'aaj tak' kii special investegative team ne apane khufia camere main bas operataron kii manamaani ko kaid kiya he
 In a double sleeper in a bus of Sahil Travels ready to go from Delhi to Bihar, where two people have a place to sleep, 4 people were duped for 20-22 hours journey
 bas ke cubical sleeper kisi pinjre se kam nahin
 Rajeev Sharma, bus operator of Maa Saraswati Tour & Travels, told about the fare, 'rates are going on many ways
 jaise sleeper hota he do aadmi ke liye
 If you take the entire sleeper, then one person will have to spend three thousand rupees
 do aadmi usamen aa jaaenge
 Shut down and go to sleep comfortably
 'reporter ne rajeev sharma se poocha, kya ek sleeper ke chah hajaar dene padenge
 On this Rajiv Sharma said, 'yes, six thousand rupees have to be paid
 uski duusari condishan ye he ki agar teen bande jaaoge to usamen aapke 2200-2200 rupye lagenge
 Three will go in it
 or agar aap chaar bande jaaoge to usamen 1800 rupye lagenge
 'aaj Tak' reporter asked the operator, where can 4 go there? is par rajeev sharma ne kaha, ja rahe hai
 The whole four are going away, but i am telling the condition
 main ye nahin kah rahaa ki aap jaao
 The truth of the arbitrariness of bus operators in the name of Chhath is that the rate card has increased by more than double and that journey is also full of problems
 chhath se pehle in bason main ek seat kaa kiraaya ek hajaar se 1500 tak kaa tha lekin ab lut khuleam he
 Talked to another bus operator Gobind Kumar
 usne sleeper main 4 aadmi jane kii baat kahi or ek aadmi kaa 1600 rupye kiraaya bataaya
 Not only this, there is a 2000 rupees fare to sit down
 sirf seat or sleeper hi nahin, bas ke har kone main, paaydaan par or paisej main baithne kii bhi keemat hajaaron main vasuuli ja rahi he
 The special investigative team of Aaj Tak also examined Pawan Travels
 bas oparator ankit bansal ne bataaya ki kone main baithne ke bhi 1600 rupye liye ja rahe hai
 Several buses going from Anand Vihar to Patna, Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi and other parts of Bihar showed how the riders were being trapped
 jin bason kii kshamta 50 logon kii he, unamem 100 logon ko bharaa ja rahaa he
 Prices are also being taken up to 2600 instead of 1000
 khuleam bas oparator apana rate card dikhaa rahe hai
 Mahi Saifee, bus operator of Trishakti Tours and Travels, also reported fare from Rs 1800 to Rs 3200 for the sleeper in their buses
 saifi ke mutabik, chhath ke baad log jaaenge to kiraaya kam he
 The rate has increased due to Chhath
 sarkari badintjami kii vajah se log khuleam luute ja rahe hai
 Now you must be wondering why the government is silent on this loot and misdemeanor because those whose job is to implement rules and laws, they are charging the price to shut their eyes
 maahi saifi ne bataaya, 'manthali jaataa he, daily bhi jaataa he
 Everyone is different
 5 number vaale alag hote hai, teen number vaale alag hote hai
 Traffic is different, police is different
 bahut kharche hai kya-kya bataaya jaae
 Bus operators are looting their compulsion, but the real problem lies with the passengers
 savaariyon ne bataaya ki ek sleeper main chaar se chah log ja rahe hai

 ‘saamana’ main shanivaar ko ‘vaastavik raaj‘yoga’!’ sheershak se ek sampadakeey lekh prakashit hua he
 It refers to the statement given by Prime Minister Modi on the occasion of Yoga Day on Friday, in which he said that yoga will help alleviate poverty
 bataa den ki shuukravaar yani 21 june ko atanrarashtriya diwas ke maukey par bharat main hi nahin balki puri duniya main logon ne yoga kiya
 On this occasion, Prime Minister Modi did yoga in Ranchi, Jharkhand

 Poverty will be alleviated with yoga, so yoga should reach the poorest of the poor
 garibon tak yoga pahunchane se ve bimariyon se bache rahenge, isse garibi dur hone main madad hogi
 'saamana' has said that Modi has had such an impact on the public that the whole country shies at the behest of what Modi says
 modi dwaara ‘yoga’ shuru karte hi puraa desh ‘yoga’may ho gaya
 While doing yoga, PM Modi (file photo-ians) tightened up on Rahul on the pretext of yoga, 'samna' has taunted Congress President Rahul Gandhi on the pretext of 'yoga'
 ‘saamana’ ke mutabik rahul gandhi guuruuvaar ko sansad main raashtrapati ramnath kovind ke abhibhaashan ke dauraan kaaphi der tak ‘mobile yoga’ karte dikhe
 On this, Saamana has said that this too will probably be the result of not having Raja Yoga
 saath hi ‘saamana’ ne kagress dwaara rahul gandhi ke mobile main vyast hone par jo safai di uske liye bhi party ko gheraa
 According to the Congress' scandal on Rahul, the Congress party has disclosed that Rahul did not understand the meaning of some Hindi words of the President's speech, so he was looking for the meaning of those words in mobile
 ab sahi kya he ye to rahul or unki party ko hi pataa hoga
 But due to not having 'raja Yoga', Rahul has to do such 'dravidi Pranayam', this is true
 saamana ne kaha ki congress jaisi partiyon ko philhal shav asana kii aavashyaktaa he
 Targeting Mamata Banerjee 'samana' also targeted Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on the issue of violence in West Bengal

 Their blood boils, it is harmful to their health
 saamana ke mutabik mamata banerjee ko yoga karnaa chahie

 US President Donald Trump today accused Iran of destabilizing West Asia
 isse pehle sanyukt raashtra main america kii rajdoot ne vishwa nikaay main apane sahyogi rajanyikon ko ek kathith irani missile kaa malba dikhaaya jo saudi arab par daagi gai thi
 In a meeting at the White House with members of the UN Security Council and his country's security team, Trump said the group had "a lot of work" to do
 unhone ‘iran kii asthir karne vaali gatividhiyon’ sahit syria main sangharsh khatm karne, aatankwaad kaa muqabla karne or uttar korea ke parmaanu nirastrikaran sahit kai uddeshyon kii ek suchi bataai
 Earlier, US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley took the Joint Base anacostia-bowling in Washington to show the missile debris to her fellow members of the Security Council
 iske baad heli ne kaha, ‘‘saboot lagaataar bataate hai ki iran spasht rup se apane antarrashtriya dayitvon kii andekhi kar rahaa he
 He said that Iran's attitude is a threat not only to its neighbors, but to the whole world
 ’’ heli suraksha parishad ko iran ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke liye samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahi hai
 This action will probably be in the form of a ban
 lekin rus iskaa virodh kar saktaa he jiske tehran ke saath kareebi rishte hai
 US officials say the metal debris displayed on the base is actually a short-range ballistic missile manufactured in Iran by Tehran provided to the Houthi rebels in Yemen
 in vidrohiyon ne november main yah missile saudi arab kii rajdhani riyaad main sthit ek antarrashtriya hawaondde par daagi thi
 The missile exploded but no casualties were reported
 baharhaal, iran ke videsh mantri javed jarif ne aaj twitor par, base main pade missile ke malbe ko khaarij kar diya or ise ‘farji samachar’ qaraar diya
 He said, "trump and company are trying to create an atmosphere in the Security Council against Iran through fake evidence

 Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, came out with a frightening scene on Monday, which shocked the whole world
 ek mandir ke baahar khadi motorcycle main hue blast kii asli sajeesh kaa to philhal pataa nahin, lekin is blast se insaaniyat jarur phir se lahooluhaan ho gai
 Life was going at its own pace
 hameshaa kii tarah is roj bhibangkok ke behad bheedbhad valetraphic jankshan par logon kaa aana-janaa jari tha
 But as soon as the needles of the clock showed the time of six o'clock in the evening at 55 minutes and 55 seconds, with a loud bang, a fireball was raised on the middle road and the very next moment there were many people scattered in the rags and scattered on the road 
 ab chaaron ore afratfari thi
 There was an atmosphere of shouting
 mauka-e-vaardaat kaa ye manjar hi ye bataane main kaaphi he ki is dhamaake ke bilkul kareeb rahe logon kii haalat kya hui
 He had died in the death of a single stroke, while there were many who were helpless due to the explosion
 imaaraten jaise kaanp uthinjo khushkismati se dhamaakon kii aanch se thodi dur rah gaye, wo jaan bachaane ke liye jidhar ban padaa, udhar hi bhaagane lage
 The blast took place in a motorcycle parked outside a Hindu temple at the Richprasong Intersection of Thailand's capital Bangkok
 dhamaake ke baad mauka-e-vaardaat par padi buree tarah jali kai motorcycilen is baat kii gavaahi de rahi thim
 According to eyewitnesses, this explosion was so terrible that many buildings surrounding it like tremors arose
 shishe chakanachur ho gaye
 So far 27 people have died in this blast, while around 80 are injured
 blast main 45 se zyada gadiyon ke parakhche ud gaye
 With this terrible explosion, the country's police as well as all the security agencies also came on its feet
 fouran mauka-e-vaardaat se raahat or bachaav abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii gai or saath hi dhamaake kii vajahon kii talaashe jane kaa kaam bhi shuru kar diya gaya
 But in this attempt, the police were again shocked when they found two more bombs inside the Irvan temple and in the taxi
 jinhen surakshakarmiyon ne fouran diphyus kar diya
 The temple has historical significance, the explosion took place outside the temple, it is not only a big center for domestic and foreign tourists but also has its old historical significance
 iravan mandir darasal bhagwaan brahma ke hi thai rup kaa mandir he or aise main ye mandir sirf hindu hi nahin balki buddha or duusare dharm-sampradaay ke logon ke liye bhi bade aakarshan kaa centre rahaa he
 How important and how crowded this area around the Irvan temple can be gauged by the fact that there is a five star hotel and two big shopping malls near the temple
 aise main sirf thailand yaa bangkok ke log hi nahin balki puri duniya ke paryatak yahaan darshan karne, ghoomane-phirane yaa phir kharidari karne ke liye jarur pahunchate hai
 The police, which began investigating the case after the blast, have so far not said anything definitively about it, but Thailand's national police spokesperson certainly said that the explosion was caused by a bomb

 In this country, transgenders, ie, eunuchs are probably worse than Dalits
 janm se shaareerik taur par purna purush yaa nari na hone vaale shaks ko ubhayalingi kaha jaataa he, haalanki ye samudaay khud ko ubhayalingi bhi kahlaana pasand nahin karata or isaki apni alag or vistrut daleelein hai
 One more thing is that as soon as the talk of transgender starts, the communities around it (gay, lesbian etc
) also jump
 baharhaal ham sirf transgenders yani kinnaron kii baat karenge
 The leaders of the country came to realize this community after 46 years of independence
 1994 main kinnaron ko matdaan kaa adhikaar diya gaya, isse andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki inke saath kis darje kaa vyavhaar hota rahaa he
 Even today, it is difficult for eunuchs to make a place in the first house far away from society
 agar kisi ghar main koi ubhayalingi baccha paidaa ho jaae to pehali baat ye he ki iskaa pataa tatkaal nahin lagata he
 When the child reaches the age of around 10 years, then his initial hormonal growth sequence is a bit rough
 kinnar bachche kaa bhavishya puri tarah uske parivaar kii soch or aarthik sthiti par nirbhar hota he
 But the new law coming to protect the rights of transgenders provides punishment for such children by removing them from the family and controlling their misbehavior
 phir bhi transgender bacchon par khatra kaayam he or uski vajah samaaj he
 Although transgender children are also protected under the Poxo law in cases such as sexual assault and rape, this protection is only for 18 years
 iske baad transgender bacchon par poxo nahin lagata, lihaaja unki samasyaayein bhi yaheen se zyada gahari ho jaati hai
 Transgenders say they usually face harassment only when they get out of the house
 public tailet se lekar restaraan or anya saarvajanik sthalon par unhen hameshaa hi mushkilen jhelni padati hai
 Probably one of the reasons for the eunuchs being poorly educated is the harassment in school
 hamane apane skool main padhane vaale ek aise hi bachche kaa udhaaharan dekha tha jabaki us bachche kii hormonal therapy bhi chal rahi thi
 Despite the costumes of the child, his voice was not the same
 jaahir he aise main saamaanya bacchon ke saath trans bachche kaa saath shikshak kii maujuudagi tak hi saadhaaran rah paata he
 As soon as the teacher leaves, he gets harassed
 ab ghar se lekar skool tak jis bachche ke saath agal tareeke kaa bartaav hoga to uskaa komal man-mastishk kam se kam padhai laayak to nahin rah jaataa he
 The transgender community probably originates from a few educated and professional people
 koi ipies, iees nahin niklaa
 Apart from not getting a chance to study and write, transgenders have no employment option except dancing
 inako koi sammaan nahin detaa
 Neither is the law
 bharat ke aapraadhik kanoonon main transgenders kaa zikr nahin he isliye inke saath hue aparaadhon ke liye nyaay bhi nahin mil paata he
 i have not seen any example of punishment in rape of eunuchs even in the news
 nayaa kanoon transgenders ko yon utpeedan main raahat to pradaan karata he lekin maamuli si
 Transgenders themselves do not agree with this
 unka kahana he ki transgenders se rape main bhi mahilaon se rape jaisi sajaa honi chahie
 Apart from this, they should have the freedom to choose their gender
 nayaa kanoon unhen surgery ke jariye or colector ke certificate ke baad purush yaa mahila kahalaane kaa haq detaa he
 Transgenders consider it an injustice to themselves and say whether a man or a woman has to get a certificate to decide their gender
 jab unhen nahin lenaa padataa to hamaare upar ye boj kyon daalaa gaya
 Eunuchs say that gender is not dictated by physical structure alone, and every person should have the right to choose gender
 yani shaks batayega ki wo mahila, purush yaa kinnar he or use kis category main rahanaa pasand he
 There is no intention of the government to fall into such a detailed definition, but the law gives a system more than before
 sarkaar ne sansad main kaha he ki kanoon ke niyamon ko banaate samay vidheyak kii kamiyaan dur kar lee jaaengi
 Another tough rule is that of CBSE which bothers the eunuchs and that after 12th, i
e
 after the age of 18, there will be no change in the certificate
 iskaa matlab ye hua ki 18 varsh kii aayu ke baad koi agar apane certificate main purush, mahila yaa transgender karwaanaa chahta he to aisa nahin ho sakegaa
 The practical situation is that for 18 years, any child stays with the parents and does not have the courage to consider himself as another gender and get the documents changed accordingly
 sibiesai kaa ye niyam nihaayat hi asamvedansheel he
 Not only this, there are many other aspects related to the lives of transgenders on which society and government will have to think sensitively, otherwise their lives will never be able to change

 An Italian nun has recently become a mother and after giving birth to a child, she has given a strange statement

 After inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of various development projects here, the Prime Minister said, “the solution to every problem is in development
 pehle aisi sarkarein ain, jinamein vikaas se nafrat jaisaa maahaul tha
 For them, the government coffers were destroyed in programs to win elections
 hamaari koshish he ki vikaas ke ve sapane saakaar hon, taaki garib kii jindagi main badlaav laane kaa avasar taiyaar ho

 60 fisadi jahaajon kaa rasta ruk jayegapak kii kamai main aegi 40% kii giravatpakistan ke airspes band karne ke jawaab main rajyasabha saansad subramanyam swami ne kaha he ki bharat ko karachi bandargah jane vaale samudri jahaajon ko bhi arab sagar se guzarane nahin dena chahie
 Swamy's statement came after reports that Pakistan was shutting down its airspace for traffic operating from India
 darasal, mangalvaar ko pakistan ke vigyaan evam praudyogiki mantri fawaad choudhary ne bharat ke liye apane desh ke hawaii kshetra band karne kaa sanket dete hue twit kiya tha
 Subramaniam Swamy then tweeted that my advice to the Namo government is that if Pakistan closes its airspace for our commercial and civilian aircraft, then the route for Karachi port to India will be closed for ships going through the Arabian Sea Should be taxed
 agar hakeekat main bharat arab sagar se karachi jane vaale maarg par purna pratibandh laga de to kya hoga
 How many ships will not be able to go to Karachi? pakistan ko isse kitna nuksaan hoga
 My advice to Namo Govt: If Pak closes their airspace for our commercial and civil aircraft, India should close Karachi port by blocking ships going through Arabian Sea (which needs to be renamed) to Karachi port
 — Subramanian Swamy (@swamy39)august 28, 20191
 According to the Rastakarachi Port Trust, 60 per cent of ships will halt at present 1600 ships arrive at their ports annually
 agar bharat arab sagar main apana kshetra band karata he to karachi jane vaale kareeb 60 fisadi jahaajon ko rasta badalanaa hoga
 With this, China and Pakistan will be the biggest losers
 kyonki, china ke zyaadaatar jahaaj bengal kii khadi se hote hue srilanka kii taraf se arab sagar ke raste karachi bandargah jate hai
 If India imposes a ban in the Arabian Sea, then ships coming from all Southeast Asian countries will have to pass through Africa
 isse yatra kaa samay kareeb ek din yaa usase adhik bad saktaa he
 2
 duusare bandargah par rukenge raste se guzarane vaale jahaajayatra kaa samay or duuri badhane se jahaajon ke eendhan kaa kharch bhi badhegaa
 In such a situation, those ships who are trying to stop Karachi will have to stop at some other port
 isse duusare bandargah ko aarthik taur par phayda hoga
 Because the fare they were going to pay to the port of Karachi
 duusare deshon ke jahaaj africa, yaman, oman ke raste hi pakistan kii taraf ja paaenge
 Or will use the ports of these countries
 3
 4748 employees and 315 officers will be reduced to work
 There are currently 4748 employees and 315 officers working at Karachi port
 jahaajon kaa aavak kam hone se vahaan ke karmchaariyon ke kaam par asar padegaa
 Due to shortage of goods, the work of daily wage laborers will stop
 saamaan utrega nahin to karachi port trust ko baari nuksaan hoga

 karachi bandargah kii kamai main aegi 40 fisadi kii giravatakarachi bandargah samudr ke raste kamai ke maamle main pakistan ko sabase zyada revenue detaa he
 According to the website of Karachi Port Trust, Pakistan earns about 61% of the earnings from the sea route from the port of Karachi
 agar bharat arab sagar main pratibandh lagaataa he to usase karachi bandargah kii kamai main kareeb 40 fisadi kii giravat aegi
 There may be more economic losses than this

 India has already presented such an example earlier, in February this year, the Government of India increased the custom duty
 isse kareeb 800 contanners cement ke karachi bandargah par atak gaye the
 Cement traders of Pakistan were at a loss
 karachi bandargah se bharat kii taraf fal, cement, rasayan, fertilizer, chamada yaa chamade ke utpaada bharat kii taraf aate hai

 The Indian Air Force demolished the camp of jaish-e-mohammed, a terrorist organization based in Balakot, Pakistan late Monday
 is kaam ko vaayu sena ke miraj 2000 ke jariye anjaam diya gaya
 Government sources were quoted as saying that about 300 terrorists were reported killed in this attack
 centre sarkaar kii ore se bataaya gaya he ki bharat ne aatanki camp ko dhwast kiya he
 This was not a military action
 vaayu sena kii is karrwai ke baad jammu-kashmir ke kai netaaon ne apane bayaan die
 National Conference leader and former Chief Minister of the state Omar Abdullah made several tweets about this action
 unhone is puri karrwai ko ek nayaa khel bataaya
 Omar Abdullah tweeted that the attack on jaish-e-mohammed's camps by the Indian Air Force is a completely new game as it is the first time during the peace period aerial attacks have been carried out in the neighboring country
 jem hit Indian forces & claimed the attack
 In turn Indian forces hit jem & owned that air strike
 It's now time for cooler heads to prevail
 War is never an ideal option to resolve disputes
 Let's go back to the india-saudi joint statement of last week
 Abdullah tweeted that with the Balakot air strike, we have reached a new precedent
 uri ke baad hua sargical strike hamaare nuksaan kaa badla lene ke liye tha, lekin balakot jaish ke sambhavit hamalon ko rokane ke liye bartaa gaya ehtiyaat he
 Is a completely new game
 We've entered a whole new paradigm with the Balakote air strike
 The post Uri strike was to avenge our losses, Balakote was a "preemptive strike to prevent an imminent jem attack"
 Totally new ballgame
 Todays IAF strikes were followed by mass war hysteria on twitter & news channels
 Most of these people are ignorant who have suspended the use of common sense
 But its disconcerting that educated privileged people are cheering on at the prospect of a war
 This is true jahaalat
 In another tweet, he said that if my retaliation is unnecessary retaliation, so be it
 main sirf shanti ke paksh main hum or main samuhik ahan ko santusht karne ke liye anginat logon ko balidaan karne se bachanaa chaahuungi
 i think it is necessary to have a wrong sense of pride and patriotism
 If my aversion to unnecessary retaliation & subsequent war makes gullible people question my nationalism then so be it
 i would rather bat for peace & save lives than sacrifice countless ones just to satisfy collective egos and misplaced sense of pride & patriotism

 itnaa hi nahin, kareeb 1000 kilo bam bhi barasaaye gaye
 This action of the Indian Air Force has been welcomed by all political parties and congratulated the Army
