fasebuk par ek profile he, sankat mochan sant shri ke naam se he
 There are many videos related to computer Baba on it
 isi main ek video 8 march ko post kiya gaya he jisamen baba narmada ke kinare ped lagane ke naam par hue ghotaale kaa pardaafash karne ke liye ek april se yatra nikaalnaa chaahate hai
 Photo journalist Raj Patidar drew our attention towards this video
 raaj patidaar 20 saal se photo patrakarita kar rahe hai
 Currently associated with Reuters
 ek poster bhi bana he jisamen likhaa he ki 45 zilon kii pantalis divasiy yatra nikalne ja rahi he
 In this, the entire Sadhu Sant Samaj is going to take out the Narmada Scam Rath Yatra
 iskaa netritv computer baba kar rahe the or sanyojak the pandit yoge mahant
 The poster said that according to the Chief Minister, 6 crore saplings were planted, which is not known anywhere
 is bade vriksharopan kii jaanch kar doshiyon ko sazaa di jaae
 Illegal mining in the Narmada River was immediately stopped
 har panchayat main gaushala kaa nirmaan kiya jaae or uskaa sangrakshan sadhu-santon ko diya jaae
 Immediately solved all the problems of the Math temples of the state jaae
 There are nine points in this poster in total
 ek april se lekar 15 may tak chalane vaali yatra kya rajyamantri ke pad ke laalach se badal gai
 The Baba people who were accusing the scam, were saying that the Chief Minister's claim of planting 6 crore saplings is false, he takes the position of Minister of State from the same Chief Minister, this leads to loss of the credibility of politics or these babas who use religion The learning of it falls
 press ne khub poocha ki aap to narmada ghotaale kaa aarope laga rahe the, ab mantri ban gaye
 You can decide how legitimate it is to make Baba's minister of state
 kya inke virodh ko rokane ke liye rajyamantri banaaya gaya
 Did these babas become ministers to prevent the scandal of plantation along the banks of the Narmada? ab to tivi main reporting kam hoti he varanaa paanch report paanch ghante ke bheetar shoot kar bataa sakate the ki 6 karod paudhe jo lagaae the unki kya haalat he
 At the moment, you will see a debate on this subject on TV, but you will never know the truth, because the debate will now start with examples like opposition on Hindu Baba being made a minister and silence on making Maulvi the minister
 aap yah kabhi nahin jaan paaenge ki 6 karod ped kahaan gaye
 On 19 July 2017, our colleague Anurag Dwari filed a report
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne narmada seva yatra shuru kii thi, uske liye bharat hi nahin, videshi akhabaaron main bhi vigyaapan die gaye the
 The state government spent 33 crore 7 lakh 40 thousand and 344 rupees on this advertisement
 vidhansabha main puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main sarkaar ne hi yah jaankaree di thi
 Due to this visit, TV channels received 13 crore 23 lakhs in the form of advertisements and newspapers received 10 crore 77 lakhs
 aapako pataa hoga ki madhyapradesh main 11 disambar 2016 se 15 may 2017 ke bich namaami devi narmade seva yatra nikaali gai thi
 15 lakh rupees was spent every day on just traveling
 tab sarkaar ne kaha tha ki 33 karod kii rakam zyaada nahin he
 On July 2 last year, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan set a target of planting 6 crore trees
 vishwa ricard banane kaa lakshya tha
 Preparations were done for which Bakayaka was trained
 iske baad bhi haalat ye he ki iskaa ghotaalaa ujagar karne kaa elaan kuch baba karte hai or unhen mantri bana diya jaataa he
 It is not a matter of religion and faith, but to cover the question, who are searching for 60 million plants
 computer baba apane bare main daawa karte hai ki unka dimag computer jaisaa he
 Take a laptop with you
 indore ke ahilyanagar main inkaa bhavy ashram he
 Computer was not invented in India, but it was Baba who later became the Minister of State
 isaki bhavishyanavi nestrodamas yaa steve job yaa bill gates ne nahin kii thi

 Narmadananda Maharaj remains in discussion due to visits on the occasion of Hanuman Jayanti and Ram Navami
 narmada kii safai or aviralata ke liye bhi sakriy rahete hai
 He has been honored for working on the subjects of plantation, water conservation and sanitation along the banks of the Narmada

 There is also his ashram here
 madhyapradesh ke mahakaushal ilaake main unke kaaphi samarthak hai
 Yogendra Mahant of Indore was seen with top leaders of Congress and BJP
 sarkaar ke khilaaf narmada ghotaalaa rath yatra ke sanyojak the
 He is also the National President of the World Brahmin Society
 ve daawa karte hai ki 35 saal se dharmik, saamaajik or shaikshanik kshetra main kaam kar rahe hai
 Where did the plants go? isaki asli report to tabhi milegi jab samvaadadaata narmada kinare paudhon kaa gauge lenge jis par rajya sarkaar ne kai karod rupee kharch kiye hai
 The magazine newspaper has published a report from Katni in Madhya Pradesh
 is khabar kii hedline dekhie - haal hi main bane world ricard kaa mitaa naamo nishaan, afasaron kii andekhi se ho gaya ye haal
 This is news of harvest prayek paudhe kii dekhbhaal ke liye prayek panchayat or gramnagar main paudh rakshakon kii niyukti kii gai
 Some plant guards were also given training
 lekin unki niyukti kii jaankaree kisi ko nahin he
 The plants are not labeled
 abhiyaan ke saadhe paanch maheene biit jane ke baad patrika ne khabar kii thi
 One news of the magazine is from Hoshangabad
 yah isi 23 march kii khabar he
 It is written that on July 2 last year, officers and organizations looted accolades for planting saplings on more than ten Narmada Ghats in Sohagpur block, but no one is coming to save these plants
 karmchaaree maanate hai ki blaak main lagaae gaye dhai lakh paudhon main se pachaas fisadi hi punap paae hai
 The success of plantation will be reduced from 50 percent to only 20 to 25 percent
 harda or narsinghpur main vriksharopan ke baad paudhe suukh gaye hai
 Handia village of Harda is on the banks of Narmada
 yahaan kahin paudhe suukh gaye hai kahin-kahin bache bhi hue hai
 It was claimed to plant ten thousand saplings in Barman village of Narsinghpur district but now there are no saplings left
 naam maatr ke hi hai
 It is suspected that Baba, who was about to take a trip to uncover the plantation scandal, was made the Minister of State so that he could be silenced
 dharm chup ho jaae
 Our politics is becoming like this now
 apane gaanv main ek math banavaa lijie, gaanv main saansad to nahin aaenge, math main zarur aaenge phir vahaan gherkar puuchhiega
 Rahul Gandhi is going to Lingayat Math in Karnataka, Amit Shah is also going
 raajnneeti kii is kamazori kii taraf na jane kitne log ishaara karte hai phir bhi jab chunaav aata he to kaam kii baat kam, math, baba, mazaar, maulavee hone lagata he
 Some become incarnations of Ganga and some become priests of Shiva
 meri raay main janaa to chahie har jagah magar wo agar vot ke liye jaaya ja rahaa he, janata ke sawaalon se dhyaan hataakar janata ko khatm karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This story you saw, it is a story of your end, not of politics
 netaa ko yah baat pataa he, bas aapako pataa nahin chal paata he
 This is the politics of India
 janata kahaan hai yahaan he
 
 
 The public is searching for the media every day, the media has stopped searching the public
 tippaniyan In West Bengal, some students are carrying banners in front of the State Selection Commission
 inke liye na to koi baba aata he na koi maulavee na koi aapkaa netaa? ek chaatra ne likhaa he ki kolkata main WBPSC Office ke saamne chaatr dharna de rahe hai
 The press was called but no one came
 2016 main junior ejeeniyar kii pariksha hui, civil or mekenekil ejiniyaron ke liye
 1356 students appeared in the civil list and out of these 1082 were given postings
 magar 274 chaatr abhi bhi jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 The student said that the problem is of many, but only 30-35 people have come for their own rights
 janata jab janata nahin rah jaati, vah raajnneeti main janata ke alaava kuch or hokar panaah maangati he to uski ye haalat ho jaati he
 It is not public for the media either
 aap swatantra hai baabaaon ke mantri banaae jane par khush hone ke liye
 You have now come to know something about tree plantation in Madhya Pradesh
 bahut se kaaryakarta eemaandaaree se kisi party main apana jivan jhonk dete hai
 In every election, they are longing that they will get a ticket and they will also be able to get a chance of representation, they will also get power, how will such workers feel
 bees-bees saal kisi party main lagane se to acha tha ki ve baba ban jate or kisi bhi party se sansad se lekar rajyamantri ke pad tak pahunch jate
 If you understand the importance of activists in politics, then you can also see that five Babas have been given the status of Minister of State by stumbling upon the interests of five loyal workers
 ab kaaryakarta bhi sawaal nahin karte hai, virodh nahin karte hai to unke saath jo ho rahaa he wo thik hi ho rahaa he
 Do they not know anything wrong in this? kaaran bhi ajeeb he
 a committee has been formed to conduct a public awareness campaign on the subject of tree plantation, water conservation and sanitation in the Narmada banks
 in sabhi ko usee main shaamil kiya gaya he
 After that the status of Minister of State was given
 inamen se ek hai computer baba jinhone elaan kiya tha ki ve narmada bachaao ke kaam main bhrashtachar ko saamne laane ke liye narmada ghotaalaa rath yatra nikaalane vaale hai
 Now he has become the Minister of State
 pehle raajnneetik bayanon ko jaldi se nipta dete hai phir aate hai asli baat par
 Prabhat Jha said that the saint is the minister and not the bandit
 aam taur par ek tark kaa ek dhaancha hota he
 In this way, things are presented so that you feel that opposing Baba's appointment as Minister of State is against religion
 phir turant udhaaharan diya jayega ki falaan kii sarkaar main kisi maulavee ko bhi rajyamantri kaa darja diya gaya tha
 Like Tauqir Raza Khan was given the status of Minister of State in UP
 us vakt bhi aalochana hui hi hogi, kaha gaya hoga ki tushtikaran he
 What is the status of Minister of State to Baba? pehle ke galat ke sahare aaj ke galat ko sahi bataaya ja rahaa he
 a news was published in Business Standard
 29 may 2013 kii yah khabar bataati he kiyupi main tawqir raza ko hathakargha vastra udyog vibhaag ke salaahkaar ke rup main niyukt kiya gaya
 He was given the rank of Minister of State
 tab bhartiya janata party ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 According to the news, Shripati Singh and KP Singh were also given the status of Minister of State but the BJP had opposed the grant of Minister of State status to Tauqeer Raza Khan, President of ittehad-e-millat Council
 tab ke rajyapal biel joshi se mulaakaat kii thi
 The SP had requested the government to change the decision
 bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant vaajapeyi pratinidhi mandal lekar rajyapal se mili the
 It was said that this is minority appeasement
 raajnneeti se prerit he
 If the status of Minister of State to Tauqir Raza is minority appeasement, then what is the satisfaction of giving five Babas the status of Minister of State? is bindu par aap soch sakate hai
 Now come to the computer Baba
 baba ne naam par
 There is a profile on Facebook, named Sankat Mochan Sant Shri
 is par computer baba se sambandhit kai video hai
 In this, a video has been posted on 8 March in which Baba wants to take out the yatra from April 1 to expose the scam in the name of planting trees along the banks of Narmada
 is video kii taraf photo jarnlist raaj patidaar ne hamaara dhyaan dilaayaa
 Raj Patidar has been doing photo journalism for 20 years
 is vakt riter se jude hai
 a poster has also been written which states that a forty-five day journey of 45 districts is going to leave
 isamen sampurna sadhu sant samaaj narmada ghotaalaa rath yatra nikaalane ja rahe hai
 It was headed by Computer Baba and Convenor was Pandit Yogha Mahant
 poster main kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri ke anusaar 6 karod paudhon kaa ropan hua jiskaa kahin koi namonishaan nahin he
 The culprits should be punished by checking this large plantation
 narmada nadi main ho rahe avaidh utkhanan par turant roak lage
 Gaushala should be constructed in every panchayat and its protection should be given to sages and saints
 pradesh ke math mandiron kii sabhi samasyaon kaa turant niraakaran kiya Go kul milakar nau bindu hai is poster main
 Did the yatra, which ran from April 1 to May 15, change with the greed of the post of Minister of State
 jo baba log ghotaale kaa aarope laga rahe the, kah rahe the ki mukhyamantri kaa 6 karod paudhe lagane kaa daawa jhootha he, wo usee mukhyamantri se rajyamantri kaa pad le lete hai, isse raajnneeti kii saakh girti he yaa dharm kaa istemaal karne vaale in baabaaon kii sikh girti he
 The press asked a lot that you were alleging the Narmada scam, now you have become a minister
 aap tay kar sakate hai ki baabaaon kaa rajyamantri bananaa kitna jaays he
 Was the Minister of State made to stop their opposition
 kya narmada ke kinare vriksharopan ke ghotaale ko saamne aane se rokane ke liye in baabaaon ko mantri banaaya gaya
 Now the reporting in TV is less or else five reports could be shot within five hours and tell what is the condition of the 6 crore saplings that were planted
 philhal aap tivi par isi vishay par dibet to dekhenge magar sachai kabhi nahin jaan paaenge kyonki bahes ab hindu baba ke mantri banaae jane par virodh or maulavee wo mantri banane par chuppi jaise udaahranon ko lekar hone lagegi
 You will never know where the 6 crore trees went
 19 july 2017 ko hamaare sahyogi anuraag dwari ne ek report file kii thi
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan started the Narmada Seva Yatra, advertisements were given for him not only in India but also in foreign newspapers
 is vigyaapan par rajya sarkaar ne 33 karod 7 lakh 40 hazaar or 344 rupee kharch kiye the
 The government gave this information in response to a question asked in the assembly
 is yatra ke kaaran tivi channelon ko vigyaapan ke rup main 13 karod 23 lakh mili the or akhabaaron ko 10 karod 77 lakh
 You will know that Namami Devi Narmade Seva Yatra was taken out in Madhya Pradesh from 11 December 2016 to 15 May 2017
 har din yatra par sirf prachaar prasar par 15 lakh rupee kharch hue the
 Then the government said that the amount of 33 crores is not much
 pichley saal 2 july ko mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne 6 karod vriksh lagane kaa lakshya rakhaa tha
 The goal was to create a world record
 jiske liye bakaayaka prashikshan diya gaya, taiyaari kii gai
 Even after this, the condition is that some Baba declares to expose the scam and he is made a minister
 maamla dharm or aasthaa kaa nahin he, us sawaal par pardaa daalane kaa he, jo 6 karod paudhon kii khoj kar rahe hai
 Computer Baba claims about himself that his mind is like a computer
 apane saath laptaap lekar ghoomte hai
 He has a grand ashram in Ahilyanagar, Indore
 bharat main computer kaa avishkaar nahin hua, magar is naam se baba hue jo aage chal kar rajyamantri bane
 It was not predicted by Nesthrodamus or Steve Jobs or Bill Gates
 inkaa asli naam he udai deshmukh
 They are often seen with the influential people of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh
 shaan or shaukat inaki pahchaan he
 
 
 The convoy of vehicles always moves along
 bhayyuji maharaj ko raajnneetik rup se taaqatvar santon main gina jaataa he, inke pita maharashtra main congress ke netaa rahe hai
 His name came up for discussion during Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement when he was approached by the UPA government to persuade Anna Hazare
 narmadanand maharaj hanuman jayanti or ram navami ke maukey par yatraaon ke kaaran charchaa main rahete hai
 Also active for cleanliness and avidity of Narmada
 narmada ke kinare paudharopan, jal sangrakshan tathaa swatchta ke vishyon par kaam karne ke liye inhen sammanit kiya gaya he
 Come from Dindori
 yahaan unka ashram bhi he
 He has many supporters in Mahakaushal area of madhya Pradesh
 indore ke yogendra mahant congress or bijepi ke aalaa netaaon ke saath dikhte the
 The Narmada scam against the government was the convener of the Rath Yatra
 vishwa brahman samaaj sangh ke rashtriya adhyaksh bhi hai
 They claim to have been working in the religious, social and educational fields for 35 years
 paudhe kahaan gaye
 The real report will be received only when the reporters will take stock of the Narmada side plants on which the state government has spent several crores of rupees
 patrika akhbaar ne madhyapradesh ke katni se report chhaapi he
 Look at the headline of this news - recently the world record has been erased, this situation has happened due to ignoring the officers
 katni kii khabar he ye
 Planters were appointed in each panchayat and Gramnagar to look after each plant
 kuch paudh rakshakon ko training bhi di gai
 But no one is aware of his appointment
 paudhon ke namonishaan nahin he
 The magazine was reported after five and a half months of the campaign had passed
 patrika kii hi ek khabar he hoshangabad kii
 This is the news of 23 March
 likhaa he ki pichley saal 2 july ko sohagpur blaak main das se adhik narmada ghaaton par paudharopan ko lekar afasaron or sanghathanon ne vaahvahee to lut lee magar in paudhon ko koi bachaane nahin aa rahaa he
 Employees believe that only fifty per cent of the 2
5 lakh plants planted in the block have flourished
 paudharopan kii safalataa 50 fisadi se ghatakar 20 se 25 fisadi tak hi rah jaaegi
 Plants have dried up after planting trees in Harda and Narsinghpur
 harda kaa handiya gaanv narmada ke kinare he
 Here the plants have dried up and there are also some leftovers
 narsinghpur zile ke bermaan gaanv main das hazaar paudhe lagane kaa daawa kiya gaya magar ab yahaan paudhe nahin bache hai
 Are only nominal
 shaq hota he ki jo baba paudharopan ke ghapale ko ujagar karne ke liye yatra nikaalane vaale the, unhen rajyamantri kya isliye banaaya gaya ki ve chup ho jaaen
 Religion be silent
 hamaari raajnneeti ab aisi hi hoti ja rahi he
 Build a monastery in your village, mps will not come in the village, they will definitely come to the monastery, then they will surround it and ask
 karnataka ke lingayat math main rahul gandhi bhi ja rahe hai, amit shah bhi ja rahe hai
 No matter how many people point towards this weakness of politics, when the election comes, there is less talk of work, Math, Baba, Mazar, Maulvi
 koi ganga kaa avatar ho jaataa he to koi shiv kaa pujari
 In my opinion, it is necessary to go everywhere but if it is going to vote, it is done to eliminate the public by diverting attention from public questions
 ye jo aapane kahani dekhi, wo raajnneeti kii nahin, aapke khatm hone kii kahani he
 The leader knows this, just you do not know
 ye bharat kii raajnneeti he
 Where is the public here
 
 
 janata har din laachaar hokar media ko khoj rahi he, media ne janata ko khojna band kar diya he
 The comments pashchim bengal main kuch chaatr rajya chayan ayog ke saamne binar lekar khadey hai
 Neither Baba nor any cleric nor your leader comes for them? a student has written that students are staging a protest in front of the WBPSC Office in Kolkata
 press ko bulaayaa gaya magar koi nahin aayaa
 The Junior Engineer examination was held in 2016 for civil and mechanical engineers
 civil kii list main 1356 chaatro kaa naam aayaa or inamen se 1082 ko posting de di gai
 But 274 students are still waiting for joining
 chaatra ne bataaya ki samasya to bahuton kii he magar apane hi haq ke liye 30-35 log hi aae hai
 When the public is no longer the public, it seeks refuge through something other than the public in politics, then it becomes its condition
 media ke liye bhi ye janata nahin he
 You are free to be happy when Baba is made a minister
 aap ab madhyapradesh main vriksharopan ke bare main kuch-kuch jaan gaye hai
 The reason is also strange
 narmada kinare ke kshetron main vriksharopan, jal sangrakshan or swatchta ke vishay par jan jaagrukta abhiyaan chalaane ke liye ek cameti bani he
 All these are included in the same
 uske baad rajyamantri kaa darja de diya gaya
 One of them is Computer Baba who announced that he is about to take out the Narmada Scam Rath Yatra to bring corruption in the work of Narmada Bachao
 ab ve rajyamantri ban gaye hai
 First, we quickly tackle political statements and then come to the real point
 prabhaat jha ne kaha ki sant ko hi mantri banaaya he, daaku ko nahin
 There is usually a framework of an argument
 is tarah se baton ko pesh kiya jaataa he jisase aapako lage ki baba ke rajyamantri banane kaa virodh karnaa, dharm kaa virodh karnaa he
 Then an immediate example will be given that a cleric was also given the status of Minister of State in the government of such and such
 jaise upi main tawqir raza khan ko rajyamantri kaa darja diya gaya tha
 Even then, there would have been criticism, it would have been said that there is appeasement
 baba ko rajyamantri kaa darja diya janaa kya he
 Today's wrong is being described as correct with the help of earlier wrong
 ek khabar bijness standard main chhapi thi
 This news dated May 29, 2013 states that Tauqeer Raza was appointed as consultant to the handloom textile industry department at KUP
 unhen rajyamantri kaa darja diya gaya
 The Bharatiya Janata Party then opposed it
 khabar ke anusaar shripati singh or capi singh ko bhi rajyamantri kaa darja diya gaya tha magar bhaajapa ne ittehad e millat council ke adhyaksh tawqir raza kaan ko rajyamantri kaa darja die jane kaa virodh kiya tha
 The then Governor met BL Joshi
 sapa sarkaar se nirnay badalawaane kaa aagrah kiya tha
 BJP state president Laxmikant Vajpayee met the governor with a delegation
 kaha tha ki yah alpsankhyak tushtikaran he
 Inspired by politics
 agar tawqir raza ko rajyamantri kaa darja diya janaa alpsankhyak tushtikaran he to paanch baabaaon ko rajyamantri kaa darja diya janaa koun sa tushtikaran he
 You can think on this point
 ab aate hai computer baba par
 Baba in the name
 fasebuk par ek profile he, sankat mochan sant shri ke naam se he

 aap swatantra hai baabaaon ke mantri banaae jane par khush hone ke liye
 You have now come to know something about tree plantation in Madhya Pradesh
 prabhaat jha ne kaha ki sant ko hi mantri banaaya he, daaku ko nahin
 There is usually a framework of an argument
 is tarah se baton ko pesh kiya jaataa he jisase aapako lage ki baba ke rajyamantri banane kaa virodh karnaa, dharm kaa virodh karnaa he
 Then an immediate example will be given that a cleric was also given the status of Minister of State in the government of such and such
 jaise upi main tawqir raza khan ko rajyamantri kaa darja diya gaya tha
 Even then, there would have been criticism, it would have been said that there is appeasement

 Today's wrong is being described as correct with the help of earlier wrong
 ek khabar bijness standard main chhapi thi
 This news dated May 29, 2013 states that Tauqeer Raza was appointed as consultant to the handloom textile industry department at KUP
 unhen rajyamantri kaa darja diya gaya
 The Bharatiya Janata Party then opposed it
 khabar ke anusaar shripati singh or capi singh ko bhi rajyamantri kaa darja diya gaya tha magar bhaajapa ne ittehad e millat council ke adhyaksh tawqir raza kaan ko rajyamantri kaa darja die jane kaa virodh kiya tha
 The then Governor met BL Joshi

 press ne khub poocha ki aap to narmada ghotaale kaa aarope laga rahe the, ab mantri ban gaye
 You can decide how legitimate it is to make Baba's minister of state
 kya inke virodh ko rokane ke liye rajyamantri banaaya gaya

 One news of the magazine is from Hoshangabad
 yah isi 23 march kii khabar he
 It is written that on July 2 last year, officers and organizations looted accolades for planting saplings on more than ten Narmada Ghats in Sohagpur block, but no one is coming to save these plants
 karmchaaree maanate hai ki blaak main lagaae gaye dhai lakh paudhon main se pachaas fisadi hi punap paae hai
 The success of plantation will be reduced from 50 percent to only 20 to 25 percent
 harda or narsinghpur main vriksharopan ke baad paudhe suukh gaye hai
 Handia village of Harda is on the banks of Narmada
 yahaan kahin paudhe suukh gaye hai kahin-kahin bache bhi hue hai
 It was claimed to plant ten thousand saplings in Barman village of Narsinghpur district but now there are no saplings left
 naam maatr ke hi hai
 It is suspected that Baba, who was about to take a trip to uncover the plantation scandal, was made the Minister of State so that he could be silenced
 dharm chup ho jaae
 Our politics is becoming like this now
 apane gaanv main ek math banavaa lijie, gaanv main saansad to nahin aaenge, math main zarur aaenge phir vahaan gherkar puuchhiega
 Rahul Gandhi is going to Lingayat Math in Karnataka, Amit Shah is also going
 raajnneeti kii is kamazori kii taraf na jane kitne log ishaara karte hai phir bhi jab chunaav aata he to kaam kii baat kam, math, baba, mazaar, maulavee hone lagata he
 Some become incarnations of Ganga and some become priests of Shiva
 meri raay main janaa to chahie har jagah magar wo agar vot ke liye jaaya ja rahaa he, janata ke sawaalon se dhyaan hataakar janata ko khatm karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This story you saw, it is a story of your end, not of politics

 This is the politics of India
 janata kahaan hai yahaan he
 
 
 The public is searching for the media every day, the media has stopped searching the public
 tippaniyan In West Bengal, some students are carrying banners in front of the State Selection Commission
 inke liye na to koi baba aata he na koi maulavee na koi aapkaa netaa? ek chaatra ne likhaa he ki kolkata main WBPSC Office ke saamne chaatr dharna de rahe hai
 The press was called but no one came

 1356 students appeared in the civil list and out of these 1082 were given postings
 magar 274 chaatr abhi bhi jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 The student said that the problem is of many, but only 30-35 people have come for their own rights
 janata jab janata nahin rah jaati, vah raajnneeti main janata ke alaava kuch or hokar panaah maangati he to uski ye haalat ho jaati he
 It is not public for the media either

 You have now come to know something about tree plantation in Madhya Pradesh

 Gaushala should be constructed in every panchayat and its protection should be given to sages and saints
 pradesh ke math mandiron kii sabhi samasyaon kaa turant niraakaran kiya Go kul milakar nau bindu hai is poster main
 Did the yatra, which ran from April 1 to May 15, change with the greed of the post of Minister of State

 The press asked a lot that you were alleging the Narmada scam, now you have become a minister
 aap tay kar sakate hai ki baabaaon kaa rajyamantri bananaa kitna jaays he
 Was the Minister of State made to stop their opposition
 kya narmada ke kinare vriksharopan ke ghotaale ko saamne aane se rokane ke liye in baabaaon ko mantri banaaya gaya
 Now the reporting in TV is less or else five reports could be shot within five hours and tell what is the condition of the 6 crore saplings that were planted
 philhal aap tivi par isi vishay par dibet to dekhenge magar sachai kabhi nahin jaan paaenge kyonki bahes ab hindu baba ke mantri banaae jane par virodh or maulavee wo mantri banane par chuppi jaise udaahranon ko lekar hone lagegi

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday attacked Narendra Modi indirectly, saying that opposition leaders only make tall promises and work for the rich, while his party stands with the poor and helps them realize their dreams

 Rahul said, when it comes to schemes for the poor, those people ask where the money will come from

 This is the difference between these parties and the Congress

 main bolta hum Since the release of Sanju film, many new aspects of Sanjay Dutt's life are getting to see and read by the audience
 ek ke baad ek sanju kii jindagi se jude ankahe or ansune vaakye hairaan kar rahe hai
 There was also a time in Sanjay Dutt's life when he went through an era of drug addiction and begging when he was accused of even homosexuality

 When Sanjay Dutt returned, his Aziz friend and brother-in-law Kumar Gaurav helped him a lot
 darasal, kumaar gaurav ke pita rajendra kumaar ne apni film 'naam' main sanju ko cast kiya
 This film was a big hit and Sanju's career came back on track with this film
 is dauraan sanju or kumaar gaurav kii dosti bhi bahut gahari hoti gai
 Discussions about their friendship were so much that in the year 1986 news of their affair started coming
 'sanju' dekhne ke baad bhavuk hue sanjay dutt, 20 minute tak rote raheisi khabaron ke baad sanjay dutt ko khud intervyuu main is baat kii sachai bataane ke liye chuppi todani padi
 In an interview to Stardust magazine, Sanjay Dutt said, 'my and Kumar's relationship is absolutely normal
 jinka dimag ganda he wo is dosti ko bhi gande tareeke se lete hai
 If your reference is towards homosexuality then it is wrong
 'is intervyuu main sanjay dutt ne aage kaha tha- meraa or kumaar kaa ek healdi relationships he, aise rishte film industry main kam hi dekhne ko milte hai
 Let us tell you that there was a time when there was a rift in the friendship between Kumar Gaurav and Sanjay Dutt
 is daraar kii vajah koi or nahin balki sanjay dutt kii patni manyata dutt thim
 In 2008, when Sanjay Dutt got married to Manyata, not only Sanjay's flowing humility and Priya were angry for this but Kumar Gaurav was also angry
 lekin baad main ye anban bhi dur ho gai

 In the Haryana Assembly elections, former Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda has demanded the Congress high command to declare himself as the CM candidate
 sutron ke mutabik hooda jahaan khud ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karaane par ade hai or apane netritv main hi vidhansabha chunaav ladane kii maang kar rahe hai, vahiin apane bete deependra hooda ke liye bhi ve sanghathan main pad chaahate hai
 Congress president Sonia Gandhi, however, has not taken any decision on this yet
 chunaav kii taiyaari ko lekar congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke awaas das janpath par party ke varisht netaaon kii baithak hui
 In this, all the party leaders including Ghulam Nabi Azad, Bhupendra Singh Hooda were in charge of the state
 haryana main congress netritv ko lekar lagaataar pasopesh kaa daur chal rahaa he or purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda or ashok tanvar ke bich khinchataan jari he
 Former Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda recently made the Congress High Command aware of his political power by holding a grand change rally in Rohtak
 unhone raily se saaf sanket de diya he ki pradesh congress adhyaksh pad se ashok tanvar ko hataaya jaae or aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main unhen ahm bhoomika saunpi jaae
 The Congress high command is in the grip of Hooda's terms
 darasal haryana ke maujuuda congress pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar ko rahul gandhi ne niyukt kiya tha
 In such a situation, if Tanwar is removed from the post of state president, then the message will go that under Sonia Gandhi, Rahul's near ones are not getting attention
 sonia gandhi ke saamne sabase badi chunauti team rahul ko naaraaz kiye bagaiyr haryana kii rassakashi ko khatm karne kii he
 The Congress high command can take a decision on replacing the state president
 yah bhi kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki pradeshdhyaksh pad par ashok tanvar kii jagah kumari shailaja ko party kii kaman saunpi ja sakati he
 However, Ashok Tanwar is clearly saying that there will be no change in Haryana Congress
 netritv parivartan kii abhi koi charchaa nahin he
 Tanwar said that the discussion of leadership change has been going on for the last five years, the one who wants to cry, weeps
 congress ke aapasi vivaad kii vajah se vidhansabha chunaav kii res main party peeche najar aa rahi he
 As of now, there is no preparation for the Congress, while the BJP is running a fast campaign

 ghotaalaa ujagar hone ke baad neerav modi ke kai thikaanon par chaape pade or uski sampatti sij kii gai thi
 This bungalow with many bedrooms and halls also has a 1000 sq ft swimming pool on the first floor
 modi ne is bangale ke baahar avaidh tareeke se ek garden bhi banwaaya tha
 The order to demolish Nirav Modi's bungalow was issued by the Maharashtra government on 4 December itself
 aadesh par amal karte hue bangale ko todane kaa pehla charan 25 janvari ko shuru hua tha
 Then many walls were broken but work was stopped on 27 January
 neerav modi ko alibagh kshetra main 376 varg meter ke plot par bangala banane kii parmishan mili thi, lekin usne 1081 varg meter jagah kaa gheraav kiya
 Now this illegal construction is being demolished by the government
 neerav modi ke is bangale ko janvari main giraane kaa kaam isliye roka gaya kyonki prashasan ghar ke bheetar se keemtee saamaanon ko sahi se nikaalnaa chahta tha taaki bangale kii sampatti se adhik se adhik rakam kii bharpai kii ja sake

 " In Chandrapur, Maharashtra, the police lathi charged the flood victims
 baadh peediton par lathi charge karte hue police ne sari hadein paar kar di or aankh mundakar laathiyaan barasaai
 The police neither spared the women and the elderly nor the children
 yaheen nahin police ne logon kii gharon se nikaal kar bhi jamkar pitayee kii
 The crime of the people was just that they surrounded the Minister of Palak
 haalanki khabaren hai ki mantri kii gaadi par patharav kiya gaya tha
 For the fourth time in the last one month, the flood victims were surrounded by the minister Sanjay Devtale, who came to know the condition of the flood victims on Chandrapur tour and started shouting slogans against them
 iske baad police kaa gussa bhadak gaya or usne jamkar lathicharge kiya
 According to the people, the anger among the people is at the peak due to no help from the administration and not to stop the flood water entering the city
 aise main palak mantri ne bhi bad peedito kii koi sud nahin lee, isliye logon kaa gussa palak mantri par bhadkaa or mantri kii gaadi par logo ne patharav kar diya
 Police has also detained seven people
 aakhir sarkaar kamgaaron ke haalat kaise sudhaaregi? aakhir asangathit kshetra main kaam karne waalon ko apane kaam kaa sahi mehtana kaise milegaa? kamgaaron kii roti, kapadaa or makaan kii buniyadi jaruratein kaise puri hongi? ye kuch aise jalte sawaal hai jo sarkaron ko hameshaa katghare main khadi karti hai
 In fact, there is no precise estimate and statistics about the workers in the unorganized sector in India, while the number of workers in the unorganized sector is believed to be 85% of the total workers
 iske alaava is shramashakti ke bare main tamaam aise samvedansheel siddhant hai jinaki samaan vyakhyaayein kii jaani baaki hai, jaise saaf taur par aaj bhi ham ye nahin jaanate ki sarkari niyam ke mutabik kaamgaar koun hai? unki tankhwaah, sangathit kshetra, asangathit kshetra, laghu udhyam, medium udhyam aadi kii paribhaashaayen tay nahin hai
 Due to this, it is difficult to find out the situation, make policies and plans under labor reform
 2017 main jab desh main berogari par bahes jari thi, tab niti ayog ne tippanee kii thi ki yah bahes 'hawa main ho rahi he' kyonki jo anumaan maujuud hai ve yaa to puraane pad chuke hai yaa phir aise survey par aadhaarit hai jinamein khamiyaan hai
 Because of this, the real picture of employment in the whole country cannot be ascertained
 tab se ab tak sthiti main zyada fark nahin aayaa he lekin bahes berogari kii jagah shram kanoonon main sudhaar par aa pahunchi he
 Shocking definitions The report of a task force of the Policy Commission says that relevant and accurate figures do not exist because there is no uniformity in the definitions used for workers
 udhaaharan ke taur par bharat main sangathit (formal) kamgaaron ke liye paribhaasha tay nahin he isliye kai paribhaashaayen istemaal hoti hai
 The most common definition applies to people working in registered enterprises under the Factories Act, 1948, that they are organized workers
 haalanki, eneseso apane survey main inhen formal kii jagah orgenised likhata he
 Under this definition, all workers working in the service sector will be called informal 'or' unorganized workers
 isse alag, shram evam rojgaar mantralay kamgaaron ke vargeekaran ke liye duusari paribhaasha istemaal karata he
 Enterprises that have 10 or more workers and the Ministry considers all government employees as organized workers
 is paribhaasha main 'formal' ke saath 'argenised' shabd kaa bhi istemaal he
 Another definition refers to workers who are on contact, regardless of the size of the enterprise
 yah paribhaasha 'formal' or 'orgenised' ke bich antar spasht karti he, lekin bhartiya sandarbh main yah virodhabhasi he
 The report states that all these definitions are "a big hurdle and exclude workers from all permanent jobs because they are not working in a large enterprise or do not have written contracts
" ” tamaam vikalpon par vichaar karne ke baad task force ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki sangathit kshetra ke kamgaaron se jude aankadon ke liye ek nai or vyaavhaarik paribhaasha kii jarurat he
 The new code also has flaws: The government is trying to incorporate 44 central laws into four codes
 ye chaar samhitaayen hongi— mehtaanaa sambandhi, udyog maamle, saamaajik suraksha or peshewar suraksha, swasthya or kaam kii paristhitiyaan
 However, the problem nevertheless remains
 udhaaharan ke liye, industrial relation code of 2017 main 'anorgenised' kaamgaar kaa matlab he gharelu kaamgaar, swarozgaar karne vaala yaa anorgenised sector main mehtaane par kaam karne vaala
 It also includes those who work in the organized sector but the unorganized workers are outside the purview of six laws written in the Social Security Act of 2008
 lekin soshal security code of 2018 main 'anorgenised' kii paribhaasha main kaha gaya he ki (a) aisa kaamgaar (chaahe vah gharelu kaamgaar ho, apana kaam karata ho, maalik hone ke saath kaamgaar ho, yaa tankhwaahashuda kaamgaar ho) jo anorgenised sector main kaam karata ho (b) aisa vyakti jo kisi aisi jagah kaam karata ho jahaan koi likhit anubandh na ho
 The same is the case with workers in the new codes
 inamen kai paribhaashaayen di gai hai, alag-alag shabdon kaa lachchhedaar istemaal he
 CK Sajinarayana, president of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, an association of workers associated with the RSS, says that a comparative study of all the interpretations used in the four codes is needed to bring simplicity and uniformity to them
 unke mutabik, vah har aadmi kaamgaar he jo kisi ko bhi apana shram uplabdh karaata he
 But the complexity is to the extent that the Social Security Code of 2018 alone has 144 definitions
 iske sakaaratmak paksh ke bare main sajinarayan kehete hai ki tamaam aise asangathit kaamgaar hai jo gharelu naukar, home delivery bvoy, bahurashtriya companiyon ke liye chote str par utpaadan kaaryon main jute log, contract varkar aadi ko bhi nai samhita main shaamil kiya ja rahaa he
 The real challenge is that they too should be brought under formal arrangement and they also get legal protection
 rashtriya sankhyikee ayog main chairman rah chuke pisi mohanan kehete hai ki paribhaashaon kii jatilta isliye he kyonki bharat kii arthvyavastha europea deshon se alag viksit hui he
 Most of the people here are engaged in self-employment (like farming, utensils, making wooden items, etc
) which is generally called family business
 1930 or 1940 kii janaganana main ise darj kiya gaya tha
 The word 'organized' first came to those workers who were legally protected
 baad main sarkari or sangathit kshetra ke liye 'formal' shabd chalan main aayaa
 The term 'informal' started being used for those who work in agriculture and various services
 mohanan ke mutabik, yahaan tak ki ab bhi 'work' or 'varkar' ko bhartiya sandarbh main paribhaashit karnaa bahut kathin he
 The International Labor Organization recently defined that any activity that contributes to the calculation of GDP would be considered an 'economic activity' and would be considered a 'worker'

 The Anna Hazare side said that there is no question of withdrawing from the proposed fast from August 16 on the demand for a strong Lokpal Bill and if the government tries to force the fast, the Gandhian activists will also stop drinking water
 hajaare paksh ne kaha ki vah apni maangon par kaayam rahegaa
 He, however, hinted to keep the option of dialogue with the government open
 anna hajaare ne yah bhi chetavanee di he ki agar sarkaar unhen anshan se pehle yaa anshan ke dauraan giraftaar kar leti he yaa jabardasti unka anshan todane kii koshish karti he to vah pani pinaa bhi chhod denge
 The Hazare side also expressed satisfaction with Jayaprakash Narayan Park near the Ferozeshah Kotla Stadium suggested for fast by Delhi Police

 212 kol blox ke aavanton radd karne ko lekar supreme court somvaar ko ahm faisalaa suna saktaa he
 During the hearing today, it has been said by the government that it is ready to cancel all 218 coal block allocations
 saath hi court se sarkaar ne is sambandh main jald faisla karne kii apil bhi kii
 The government urges the court not to cancel 46 blocks because work is going on in these blocks
 sarkaar ne court se kaha ki 80 kol block pehle hi radd kiye ja chuke hai
 Earlier in the hearing on August 25, the Supreme Court had termed all the allocations made between 1993 and 2008 as invalid
 court ne kaha tha ki screening cameti or tatkaaleen sarkaron ne kol blox ke aavanton main na to kisi guideline kaa paalan kiya gaya or na hi kisi tarah kii paardarshita barti gai
 However, the court said that further hearings are required before cancellation of these allocations
 court ne yah aadesh diya tha ki agle faisale tak in koyala khadaanon se niklaa koyala vyavsaayik istemaal ke liye nahin bheja jayega
 It is worth noting that in 2012, the CAG in its report had talked about a scam of Rs 1 lakh 86 thousand crore in the allocation of coal blocks
 ise lekar manmohan sarkaar kii kaafii kirakiri bhi hui
 But the Supreme Court verdict is now raising questions on the previous Vajpayee government as well

 In the recently concluded BMC election, an independent candidate surprised everyone by claiming himself to have zero votes
 desh bhar main chal rahe iviem vivaad main uske daawey ne aag main ghi daalane kaa kaam kiya
 But the Election Commission says that its claim is false and it has got a total of 44 votes
 mumbai mahanagar palika chunaav main biemasi ward kramank 164 ke nirdaleey ummidavaar shrikant sirsat ne matganana ke baad iviem mashiinon main gadabadi kaa aarope lagaate hue daawa kiya tha ki unhen ek bhi vot nahin mila
 This statement was made by the leaders opposing evms in the election
 lekin chunaav ayog kii maane to sirsat ko kul 44 vot mili hai
 The comments maharashtra chunaav ayog jansampark adhikari jagadish more ne bataaya ki shrikant sirsat kaa naam do boothon main hai or ek main unhen 11 vot to duusare main 2 vot mili hai
 It is natural for them to have their own vote in one of the two
 jagadish more ne ye bhi saaf kiya ki shrikant sirsat ne jo shikaayat kii thi usamen bhi unhone iviem main gadabadi kii baat likhi thi naa ki ek bhi vot nahin milane kii
 The question is then why did Srikanth make a false statement in the media? jiro vot milane ke daawey ke baad se media se bachate rahe shrikant sirsat shuukravaar ko media ke saamne aae or bataaya ki matganana ke turant baad hamaare logon ne bataaya ki sabhi booth main jiro vot mil rahe hai, yahaan tak ki mere booth main bhi ek bhi vot nahin mila
 So i issued that statement then
 lekin ab sach sab ke saamne he
 After the Election Commission's revelations, Srikanth may have backed down from not getting even a single vote, but he is still firm on his talk of tampering evms

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke puraane sahyogi or purv saansad shivanand tiwari yun to sakriy raajnneeti se dur hai
 But they keep giving statements from time to time
 shivanand tiwari bihar ke anbhavi netaa hai
 He has lived with Lalu Yadav in RJD and with Nitish Kumar in JDU
 donon ke kareebi bhi bataae jate hai
 Srikanth, a well-known journalist from Bihar, wrote about Shivanand Tiwari in his book 'politics of Bihar Letters' that he kept on oscillating between Lalu and Nitish like a pendulum
 in dinon shivanand tiwari soshal media fasebuk par kaaphi sakriy hai
 On Facebook itself, he has written a long letter in the name of Nitish Kumar
 chitti likhane kii vajah bataate hue shivanand tiwari ne likhaa he, 'yah chitthee 15 july kii shaam unke haath main pahunch gai thi
 Earlier, on 13 July, he had asked for a time to meet Nitish
 samay nahin milane kii vajah se apni baat un tak pahunchane ke liye chitthee kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 Even after this, he asked for an appointment twice but the time is not available
 bhrashtachar ke viruddh nitish kaa 'zero tolerance' ek dhong he
 The alliance with Lalu is the proof of this
 darasal is dhong ke bahaane pun: bhaajapa ke saath jane kaa rasta talash rahe hai nitish kyonki vahaan apane ko 'sahaj' mahasoos karte hai !'apni is chitti main shivanand tiwari ne nitish kumaar ko narendra modi or bhaajapa ke khilaaf ek maatr majboot cheharaa bataaya he
 And it has also added that if the alliance is broken in Bihar, the agenda of the BJP and the Sangh will spread across the country
 wo likhte hai, 'aaj meri vah bhavishyavaanee safal hoti dikhaai de rahi he lekin bhaajapa, narendra modi ke viruddh tumhaara cheharaa dekhnaa nahin chaahati he
 She has seen your ability and talent as an opponent in the Bihar elections, so she wants to thwart it with all kinds of tactics
 in sab maamalon main aresas kii kshamta akut he
 The media, with a few exceptions, is blindly supporting Modi
 bihar kaa gathbandhan kaise jaldi tut jaae iske peeche jaan-praan lagaakar sab jor lagaae hue hai
 'experts believe that Shivanand Tiwari is a lukewarm leader and his attack on Nitish in this way or counting the loss of alliance in his letter means that Nitish Kumar is really uncomfortable with Lalu Yadav and his family in Bihar and that We can take a decision soon about the alliance in Bihar

 This has increased the responsibility of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje in this matter
 pradhanmantri narendra modi hai or ve unke pradarshan par najar rakhenge ki rajya ko bhi usee tarah se acha banaaen, jaisaa ki gujarat ban chukaa he
 Highly placed sources say that Raje is very upset with the rampant corruption and is preparing to take strict action against some officials who have received considerable encouragement in the Congress government
 ve adhikari bijepi sarkaar main bhi pad par barkaar rakhe gaye hai
 Raje had assured that no retaliation would be taken against anyone
 haalanki, loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan prashasan ke kaam karne ke tareeke se raaje khush hai
 The officers worked well by staying within the model code of conduct
 isse chunaav ayog ko kisi bhi adhikari ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kerani padi
 Chief Secretary Rajiv Maharshi, in close coordination with the Chief Minister's Office, ensured that the administration would neither become obstructed nor involved in any kind of political game
 rajya ke mukhya chunaav adhikari ashok jain ek baar phir rajya main nishpaksh chunaav karaane main puri tarah safal hue hai
 Raje can manipulate the bureaucracy to reduce hiccups further
 afasarshahi main yah aam dharna he ki acchhee posting paane vaale zyaadaatar adhikari usee lobby ke hai, jise si
 K
 mathew ne taiyaar kiya tha
 Raje is also taking such information received from his sources seriously that some of the officers who want a good posting are defying the order of the Chief Secretary or Chief Minister's Office

 england kii ek 18 varshiyaldaki ko pataa hi nahin tha ki vah pregnent haior usne achaanak bathroom main ek pyaari si bitiyaa ko janm diya
 According to the news, Jessica Alikowski had severe pain in her back and knees and on October 24, doctors underwent her key hole surgery
 surgery ke dauraan jesica 6 maheene kii pregnent thi, lekin tab na to doctoron or na hi khud jesica ko pregnancy ke bare main kuch pataa tha
 Even after key hole surgery, Jessica's back and knees continued to ache
 ek din vah sokar uthi or toilet main gai
 In a short time she delivered a baby of three and a quarter kg, which she named Lexie
 jesica kahati hai, 'mujhe bilkul bhi nahin pataa tha ki main pregnent hum
 It is quite surprising because i am studying child care and pregnancy myself '
 'mere ghutane or peeth par bahut dard tha
 i was hurt in 2102 and i felt that maybe this is the reason for this pain
 doctoron ne mujhase kaha ki mujhe kii-hole surgery karaani hogi
 But there was no benefit even after surgery
 teen maheene baad jab maine bacchee ko janm diya tab jaakar meraa dard gaayab hua'
 According to Jessica, 'even at the time of delivery i did not know that i was pregnant
 us din main do-teen baar toilet gai
 i was having mild pain, but i felt that there is period pain
 meri mummy mujhe dekhne ke liye ai ki main thik hum yaa nahin or unhen ehsaas ho gaya ki kuch gadabad he
 i pushed for 15 minutes and my daughter was born
 meri mummy ne use pakadaa
 We were all surprised '
 'mujhe jaraa bhi nahin pataa tha ki main pregnent hum
 There was no such thing as baby bump
 main kai shaadiyon main gai thi, jahaan maine tite dress bhi pahani
 When i had a key hole surgery, the doctors did not test my pregnancy because i was having periods at that time
 surgery se pehle pregnancy test ke alaava duusare sabhi jaruri test hue the'
 'now my pain is gone and now i am more happy because now i have a little lexie'
 aapako bataa den ki 24 oktober ko jesica kii kii-hole surgery hui thi or teen maheene baad 7 farvari ko unhone apni beti ko janm diya
 Barbara's 46-year-old mother Barbara says, "it's really surprising
" jab tak ki bacchee paidaa nahin ho gai tab tak mujhe samaj main hi nahin aayaa ki ho kya rahaa he
 i caught the baby and she was crying
 thodi hi der main aspataal kii gaadi aa gai or vah use vahaan se le gaye'
 Barbara said, 'I just can't believe it
 lekin ab main kaam ke baad jald se jald ghar pahunchati hum taaki main lexi ko dekh sakuun
 Lexie is a very nice and quiet girl
 mujhe apni beti par garv he'

 After the meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Paris and wazir-e-azam Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan, there is now more talk between the National Security Advisor (NSA) of the two countries in Bangkok
 ravivaar ko hui is mulaakaat main donon deshon ne bich jammu-kashmir ko lekar bhi charchaa hui, jiske baad ek sanyukt bayaan bhi jari kiya gaya
 After the talks between Ajit Doval and Nasir Khan Janjua, the statement issued by the two countries said, "the talks discussed peace and security, terrorism, Jammu and Kashmir and many other issues including maintaining peace along the Line of Control
" ' bayaan main likhaa gaya he ki vaarta sauhardpurn or rachanaatmak maahaul main yojit kii gai
 It is worth noting that before the United Nations Climate Change Summit in Paris, there was a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif
 haalanki, donon netaaon ne adhik samay tak baatcheet nahin kii thi, lekin aamanaa-saamana hone par donon garmjoshi ke saath mili the
 Whereas earlier this year, the nsa-level talks between India and Pakistan were canceled as the two sides could not agree on a meeting agenda
 jaahir taur par donon deshon ke bich baatcheet kaa silsilaa phir se shuru ho gaya he or ummid jataai ja rahi he ki donon mulkon ke rishton main mithaas ghulegi
 It is also worth noting here that in the past, Nawaz Sharif also said in Britain that he is a supporter and ready for talks with India
 ayodhya ram mandir kaa vivaad abhi supreme court main chal rahaa he
 But the land acquired to install the statue of Lord Rama on the banks of the Saryu River in Ayodhya has also come under controversy
 yah bhoomi yogi adityanath sarkaar ne adhigrahit kii thi
 The 64 landowners have approached the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court regarding the manner in which the administration has acquired the land, where their petition has been accepted
 iske liye hai court ne prashasan adhikariyon or jameen maalikon ko apana paksh rakhane ke liye 25 july ko pesh hone ke liye taarikh tay kii he
 The Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh had announced the construction of a statue of Lord Rama, the world's tallest god on the banks of Saryu in Ayodhya, so that every person passing through Ayodhya can see Rama
 iske liye ayodhya jila prashasan ke bhoomi adhigrahan kii prakriya karte hi vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 The owners of 64 land have raised questions about land acquisition and have reached court with cases
 jameen maalikon kaa kahana he ki ram kii pratimaa lagaae jane par koi aitraaj nahin he, lekin prashasan unhen lagaataar gumraah kar rahaa he
 They allege that proper compensation was not given to the said land
 aise main tinkaa-tinkaa ikattha karke unhone apana ashiana banaaya
 Where to go now unhone kaha ki bhagwaan ram kabhi nahin chahenge ki kisi ko ujaad kar takalif pahunchaai jaae
 The petitioner Awadhesh Singh said, the Yogi government announced the installation of the idol of Lord Ram
 isse ham log khush the
 But it was not known that the idol would be built by destroying us
 lekhpal or prashasan ham logon ko lagaataar gumraah karata rahaa
 That is why we had to go to the court, because these people are not telling about compensation
 balki jabaran jameen jabaran lenaa chaahate hai
 He said, We are not anti-ram, Ram is a devotee
 aisa bhi nahin he ki ham jameen dena nahin chaahate
 But we should be given appropriate compensation
 isliye ham log court kii sharan main gaye hai taaki jisase court hi prashasan se puche ki muaavja de rahe hai yaa nahin
 The petitioner says that we were very happy with the announcement of the highest statue of Lord Rama
 laga tha ki ayodhya kaa nae tareeke se vikaas hoga
 Later it was learned that the idol will be built by destroying the colonies of our people
 iske baad bhi ham log taiyaar the
 But the district administration kept misleading us
 hamane 14 taarikh ko jiladhikari ke saath meeting kar 12 sutreey maangen bhi rakhin
 The administration had said that compensation would be given through market rate, circle rate or registry rate
 is par ham logon ne kaha market rate par muaavja chahie, jis par unhone kai jawaab nahin diya
 Another petitioner Ranjana Shukla said that when the survey was done, we came to know that someone's name did not belong to anyone
 iske baad phir kaha gaya abhi survey puraa nahin hua he, jiske baad kai baar survey karaae gaye
 After this we filed our objection, but the DM said that do not talk about not giving land, we will take the land
 isi ke baad ham court ke sharan main aae hai
 Similarly, Mamta Gupta is also seeking fair compensation
 vahiin, bhagwaan ram kii murti ko lekar vivaad khadaa hone se ayodhya ke sadhu-sant khaase naaraaz hai
 He says that no decision has been taken yet regarding the Ram temple and another controversy has been given rise to the name of Ram
 yah na sirf ram ko jabaran vivaadon main ghaseetne kii koshish he balki ayodhya kii garima ko bhi thes pahunchaai ja rahi he
 The administration is not only responsible for this but the government itself
 ramalala ke mukhya pujari acharya satyendra das ne kaha ki bijepi ke liye bhagwaan ram keval vot bank kii tarah hai
 Ramlala came to power in the name, but Ram is in Tarpaul
 iske baad kaha ki ham ek vishaal pratimaa ram lalaa kii murti sthapit karenge, lekin ab vah maamla hai court chalaa gaya
 Thus BJP is making Ramlala controversial only in Ayodhya
 ek vivaad samaapt bhi nahin hua tha ki jameen adhigrahan kaa doosraa vivaad hai court pahunch gaya he
 Manhat Paramahamsa says, it is very sad that the matter of installing the statue of Lord Rama has reached the court
 ham yogi adityanath se anurodh karnaa chaahate hai ki aap aisi jameen kaa chayan karen jo nirvivaad ho
 In such a situation, if you are not getting any land in Ayodhya, then the land of the ascetic camp is on the highway
 vahaan par bhagwaan ram kii pratimaa lagaai jaae
 We don't need anything in return for this, we have faced a lot of controversy and now do not want to get into any new controversy

 film kaa naam:courtdiarector:chaitanya tamhanester cast:veeraa sathidaar, vivek gombar, gitanjali kulkarniavadhi:116 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:2
 5 Star Whenever there is a court case in Indian films, first of all, the dialogue of 'damini' movie remembers 'tithi Pe Tithi'
 
 
 or insaaf nahin miltaa' bas isi kathan ko sach karti he riter diarector chaitanya tamhane kii film'court'
 In 1986, the director Basu Chatterjee made a film 'A Stopped Decision' which was a courtroom drama but this film is different from that, let's know what the story is of 'court': Narayan Kamble (veera Sathidar) being a Marathi folk singer Also teaches tuition to children
 narayan ko ek gater safai karmchaaree 'vasudev' ke sucite cese ke jurm main giraftaar kar liya jaataa he or phir cese shuru ho jaataa he
 Narayan's lawyer is Vinay Vora (vivek Gomber), while the government side advocates Nutan (gitanjali Kulkarni) case goes on, different facts and evidence are kept
 ab kya narayan ko nyaay mil paata he yaa nahin yahi kahani lekar aae hai diarector chaitanya
 This film, based on the background of Maharashtra, has satirically shown the activities taking place inside and outside the court in a much better way
 kabhi vakil ke hisaab se jaj ke dwaara taarikh diya janaa, vakil ke man main jaj banane kii chaah rakhana, cese ko jaldi or deree se khatt karne vaale jajon kii vyakhya, or asal jindagi main court room kii kahani dikhaai gai he
 The film is full of mesmerized actors whether it is Veera Sathidar, Vivek Gomber or actress Geetanjali Kulkarni
 film kii bhashaa kaa bhi vishesh dhyaan rakhaa gaya he taaki aam aadmi tak film kaa sandesh aasaani se pahunchaaya ja sake
 The film 'court' also makes you tear up the life of a lawyer, judge and common man
 vaise to film lagbhag 2 ghante kii banaayi gai he lekin bade-bade shots thode chote ho sakate the visheshkar film ke aakhri 10 minute
 In Hindi films, you have seen the court scenes of all the films so far, in this film, the court scenes are different from them
 film main court ke katghare asli court jaise hai, gita par haath rakhkar kasam khaataa hua koi bhi nahin dikhegaa or jis tarah se asal jindagi main court main sunwaayee hoti he usee ko roopantarit kiya gaya he
 So if you like this kind of cinema, you can watch the National Award winning film 'court'

 goa ke mukhyamantri manohar parrikar apni saadagi ke liye jane jate hai
 Parrikar has often been projected in the media as a leader traveling on scooters, but now he does not drive scooters, he has revealed the reason for this
 parrikar ne kaha ki haadase kii ashanka ko dekhte hue ab vah scooter nahin chalaate
 Addressing a gathering of BJP workers in Kanakona on Saturday, he said, 'people ask me if i travel on a scooter, i tell them that now i don't
 mere dimag main kaam ko lekar soch chalati rahati he or scooter chalaate samay agar meraa dimag kahin or he to phir main kisi haadase kaa shikaar ho saktaa hum
 Parrikar pointed out the issue of road safety and said that he no longer rides a scooter nor sits with anyone on it
 unhone kaha ki rajya sarkaar goa kii sadakon par haadase kam karne ke liye vibhinn upaay karegi
 Earlier many times in media reports it has often been said that Parrikar uses scooters for shopping from local markets in Panaji
 yahaan tak ki parrikar ko aam aadmi kii tarah qatari main khadey hue bhi dekha gaya
 He stood in queue at a wedding function in Pune
 iske alaava scooter kii sawari karte hue unki kai tasviren viral bhi ho chuki hai

 In 2001, Parrikar was awarded Distinguished Alumni Award by IIT Bombay
 iske alaava parrikar aadhaar card ke janak nandan nilekani ke sahpaathee bhi rahe

 Before Pitroda's cleaning, the Congress also gave a letter by issuing a letter on its behalf
 Sam Pitroda, Congress: What i meant was move on
 We have other issues to discuss as to what BJP govt did and what it delivered
 i feel sorry that my remark was misrepresented, i apologise
 This has been blown out of proportion
 https: / / t

 Attack on Delhi's secular ethos

 saath hi sarkaar saansadon ke sankhya bal par bhi kaam kar rahi he taaki sthagan prastaav ke tahat yadi sadan main mat-vibhaajan hota he, to use apane faisle kaa bachaav karne main saansadon kaa bahumat hasil rahe
 According to sources, if this happens, the business in Parliament can start from next week
 gyaat ho ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne guuruuvaar ko khudara kshetra main epadiai kaa virodh karne vaale sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar main congress ke sahyogi dalon ke saath baithak kii
 While many parties in the ruling coalition government are supporting FDI in retail, the government's important allies are Trinamool Congress and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) seeking withdrawal of the cabinet decision on FDI
 loksabhaa main donon partiyon ke 18-18 saansad hai
 The Muslim League's Kerala State Committee (MLKSC), another ally of the UPA, has also opposed the government's decision
 loksabhaa main iske do saansad hai
 The Prime Minister held a meeting with the leaders of these parties at their official residence to resolve differences
 is baithak main neshnal conference ke farukh abdulla, trinmul congress ke sudeep bandopadhyaay, diemke ke tii
 R
 baaluu or emelkeessi ke i
 Ahmed and Union Commerce Minister Anand Sharma attended
 sutron ne bataaya ki diemke ne sarkaar ko bharosa dilaayaa he ki vah faisle main kuch sanshodhan kii maang karegi lekin vah sarkaar ke paksh main matdaan karegi
 But the Trinamool Congress has not changed its attitude
 manmohan singh ke saath baithak ke baad trinmul congress ke netaa sudeep bandopadhyaay ne patrakaron se kaha, 'hamaare rukh main badlaav nahin aayaa he
 We want discussion but we do not want the government to fall
 ' unhone pradhanmantri ke saath hui charchaa ke bare main vivaran dene se inkaar kar diya
 Sources say that the strategy of an agreement to end the parliamentary deadlock has been 'almost made'
 trinmul congress is faisle kaa virodh karti rahegi lekin vah matdaan main hissaa nahin legi
 In such a situation, if the Trinamool Congress is absent from the voting and the DMK supports the government, then the number of mps in the Lok Sabha will be in favor of the government for important reforms in the retail business
 yahi nahin, sarkaar is mudde par samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ko bhi apane saath laane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The Lok Sabha has 22 mps of SP and BSP 21
 yadi donon partiyaan matdaan ke dauraan isse dur rahane athwa iskaa bahishkaar karne par sahamat ho jaati hai to upasthit saansadon or matdaan kaa aankada kam ho jayega
 This situation will help the government to thwart the adjournment motion without the Trinamool Congress
 loksabhaa ke 543 sadasyon vaale sadan main do-tihaai bahumat kaa aankada 272 he or sarkaar trinmul or diemke ke bina 264 saansadon ke mat praapt kar sakati he
 If both the SP and the BSP are absent from voting or one of them does not participate in the voting, then the number of votes against the proposal will be decidedly in favor of the government
 chunki sthagan prastaav par matdaan ek vishwaas prastaav kii tarah nahin he or sthagan prastaav ke tahat hone vaale matdaan main saansadon kaa bahumat yadi sarkaar ke paksh main nahin hota he to sarkaar giregi nahin lekin is haar kaa matlab use epadiai par apane faisle ko waapas lene se hoga or yah sarkaar ke liye ek sharmnaak sthiti hogi

 So at the same time, Lalu on behalf of BJP celebrating the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar, alleged that BJP and RSS are on the path of becoming 'ranga Jackal'

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Atal Bihari Vajpayee has always been known for his eloquence
 unki is style ko charitaarth karata ek vaakya yaad aata he, jab unhone sonia gandhi dwaara unki baat ko jhootha kehane par bade hi vinamrata ke saath palatwaar kiya tha
 The National Democratic Alliance government fell in 1999 with one vote
 iske baad sonia gandhi ne ek chunavi bhaashan main kaha tha ki atal bihari vaajapeyi ne jhooth kaha he
 Click here to pay tribute to Atalji, in response to which Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in his own style, hit back at Sonia Gandhi during the gathering at Phul Bagh Maidan in Gwalior
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe sonia gandhi ne jhootha kaha he, main bhi jawaab de saktaa hum lekin gwalior ke logon ne mujhe aise sanskaar nahin die hai
 After this, the Phul Bagh Maidan resonated with the thunderous applause as well as the slogans of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's name
 is sabha main atal ji ne dukh bhi jataayaa tha ki ek vot ke khilaaf jane ke kaaran sadan main wo bahumat sabit nahin kar paae or 13 maheene baad unki sarkaar gir gai
 In fact, no party had a majority in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections
 jiske baad atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main annadramuk ke saath milakar rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan ne centre main sarkaar banaai
 But 13 months after forming the government, the AIADMK withdrew its support from the NDA, after which Vajpayee failed to prove his majority in the floor test in the House and the government fell by one vote
 bataa den ki odisha ke mukhyamantri giradhar gamang ne sarkaar ke khilaaf vot daalaa tha
 He especially came to Delhi for this
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ab hamaare bich nahin hai
 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee died on Thursday evening in AIIMS, Delhi

 The reason for this was the loss to the Center and the states by bringing these products under the purview of GST
 ab jabaki is vyavastha ko lagu hue ek saal puraa ho chukaa he, to prakritik gas or jet ful ko iske daayre main laane par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he

 On the other hand, states levy VAT up to 20%

 But if 18 per cent is applied, the cost of production of electricity and fertilizer will increase
 unhone kaha ki sienji ke liye tex nirdhaaran (fitment) ek samasya ho sakati he

 England captain Eoin Morgan has admitted that Kuldeep Yadav completely dared his batsmen in the first T20 match of the series
 morgan ne saath hi kaha ki agar mejabaan team ko bharat ko siries main kadi takkar deni he, to baaki maichon main mehmaan team ke kalai ke spinneron ke khilaaf behatar pradarshan karnaa hoga
 In the match held at Old Trafford last night, Kuldeep took five wickets for 24 runs, allowing England to score 159 runs for 8 wickets
 kuldeep ne apane tisare over main morgan (7), johny beresto (0) or jo root (0) ko pavilion bheja, jisase 10 over main baad ek wicket par 95 ran banaakar behad majboot sthiti main dikh rahi england kii team bade score tak nahin pahunch pai
 India responded with an eight-wicket victory to take a 1-0 lead in the series
 dhoni or kuldeep kii 'jugalbandi' ne bana daale do-do world recordmorgan ne kaha, ‘bengaluru (jab farvari 2017 main yujavendra chahal ne 25 ran dekar chah wicket liye) main hamane acha pradarshan nahin kiya
 But, that was a different match, this match was different
 kuldeep ne chaar gend main teen wicket chatkaaye or hamen chakaaya
 It was not like we shot in the air
 unhone hamen puri tarah se chaka diya or mujhe lagata he ki unhone acchhee gendbaaji kii
 He said, 'we did not score enough runs and we probably scored 30 to 40 runs less
 mujhe lagata he ki hamaari shuruyaat shandaar thi
 Kuldeep bowled well, but we know that we can face him better than this
 agle match se pehle hamen apni yojana kaa akalan karnaa hoga or sunishchit karnaa hoga ki yojana sahi ho or ham is par kaayam rahen
 Morgan told his batsmen to take a lesson from Jos Buttler, who faced the spinners quite well
 bharat ne match main puri tarah dabadabaa banaae rakhaa

 agar ham mushkil maukon ko bhunaa lete, to match kaa nateeja kuch or ho saktaa tha
 Like if Chris Jordan missed a catch at the boundary or if Rahul was caught at point at the beginning of the innings
 to yah match puri tarah se alag hota
