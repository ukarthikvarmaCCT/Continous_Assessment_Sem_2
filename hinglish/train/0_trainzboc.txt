 Recently, there were reports of differences between Bollywood actors Arjun Rampal and Salman Khan
 lekin arjuna rampal ne ek twit ke jariye is baat kaa khandan kiya he or kaha he ki ye sirf afvaah he, is par dhyaan naa diya jaae
 Let us tell you that an online portal had reported that Arjun Rampal and Salman Khan met a few days ago
 donon ne saath saath dinar kiya tha
 As we know that Shah Rukh Khan and Arjun Rampal, who were once good friends, are not doing well these days
 isi silsile main salmaan or arjuna ke bich baatcheet hone lagi
 But when Arjun started doing evil to Shahrukh with Salman, Salman did not like it at all
 salmaan ne turant arjuna ko unke ghar se chale jane ko kaha
 Seeing the market of rumors hot, Arjun immediately reacted to this matter
 twitor ke jariye unhone saaf kiya ki ye sab ek afvaah he or is baat main koi sachai nahin he
 Significantly, Arjun Rampal immediately gives his reaction on any such contravention
 isse pehle unhone twitor ke hi jariye sujain khan se apana naam jode jane kii khabaron kaa khandan kiya tha
 So now i am bitching abt SRK to @ beingsalmankhanat Salman's residence

 It is said that if BJP gives tickets to anyone from Patna Sahib, JDU from Nalanda and Congress from Kishanganj, it is sure to win the elections
 ravishankar prasad to vaise bhi diggaj netaa hai lekin unke liye ladaai itani aasaan nahin he
 He is pitted against his own conspirator Shatrughan Sinha
 aise pratyaashee se, jo lagaataar do baar patna sahib se saansad rahaa he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad is getting on the streets of Patna Sahib and meeting people
 peeche samarthakon kaa rela he
 Sloganeering is going on behind
 narebaaji ke saath ravishankar prasad kaa utsaah bhi badhata ja rahaa he
 Meanwhile, Aaj Tak spoke to Ravi Shankar Prasad on different issues in his constituency Patna Sahib
 prasad ne ajtak kii ekjicutive editor anjana om kashyap se kaha, 'main shatrughna sinha kaa naam nahin luungaa
 This is a fight of issues - hope vs
 opportunism
 ab wo nai party main gaye, 22 saal hamaari party main the
 We worked hard to win them
 vahaan gaye hai, jane dijie
 We will definitely ask the party that has gone in, that Rahul Gandhi insults the martyrs today, and asks for evidence
 is chunaav kaa mudda he ki shaheedon kaa saboot chahie yaa hindustan ko ek sachcha sapoot chahie
 'patna Sahib's battle has become a battle of the nose for Ravi Shankar Prasad
 chunaav prachaar main ravishankar prasad or bijepi ne puri takat jhonk di he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad is seeking votes not for himself, but for Modi
 ajtak se baatcheet main unhone kaha, 'main dedh maheene se kshetra main gum rahaa hum
 Everyone has come out to support me
 inkaa utsaah dekhie, sab log narendra modi ji ko dobaaraa pradhanmantri bananaa chaahate hai
 Today i am proud that Narendra Modi has elevated India to that height
 garibon ke liye, sainikon ke liye or hindustan kaa maan-sammaan badhaayaa he
 The issue of this election is who will lead India and who will respect India
 'patna sahib main ravishankar prasad jeet ke liye edi chotii kaa jor laga rahe hai, udhar, shatrughna sinha bhi puri takat se chunavi akhaade main jame hue hai
 Shatrughan Sinha became a Member of Parliament twice from Patna Sahib on a BJP ticket, but this time the political world of Shatrughan Sinha changed
 shatrughna ne congress ke khilaaf apni siyasat kii pari shuru kii thi lekin ab congress ke hi tikat par patna sahib se chunaav maidan main hai
 For the last few years, Shatrughan Sinha's opposition was running against the government, so the BJP did not remove him from the party but he cut his ticket
 shatru tikat ke liye argedy or congress ke chakkar kaatane lage
 He insisted that irrespective of the situation, the location would not change
 yani ladenge to patna sahib se
 Shatrughan Sinha finally got a Congress ticket from Patna Sahib seat
 to bijepi ne ravishankar prasad ko unke khilaaf chunavi maidan main utaar diya
 Patna Sahib seat, which was the VIP seat of Bihar in the battle of two veterans, has now become even more in the headlines
 do-do kysth netaaon kii ladaai main patna sahib kii ladaai dilachasp ho gai he
 Patna Sahib seat has 28 percent upper caste voters, mostly Kayasthas
 patna sahib seat par kysth vot hi nirnaayak rahe hai
 BJP holds 5 of the 6 assembly seats of Patna Sahib
 ajtak ke ek sawaal ke jawaab main ravishankar prasad ne kaha, 'bijepi kii aitihaasik jeet hogi
 We are satisfied that under the leadership of Narendra Modi, they have tried to make India honest and they will take it forward
 ' shatrughna sinha ke bare main ek sawaal par unhone bhojpuri main kaha ki 'ham hero naikhin, patna ke ago saadhaaran kaaryakarta bani
 We continued to live among the people and those of Hamra
 ab hamaraa ke hero mat banaain
 The hero Badan is his friend (I am not a hero, i am an ordinary worker from Patna
 main janata ke bich rahata hum or hamen vaisaa hi rahane diya jaae
 Now i don't have to be a hero, let me be the hero)
 ravishankar prasad ne aage kaha ki 23 taarikh ko ginati hogi to aitihaasik jeet hogi
 Only BJP is going to get absolute majority alone
 hindustan kaa aam naagarik ye maanata he ki desh modi ji ke haathon main surakshit he
 More recently, Prime Minister Modi described Rajiv Gandhi as 'corrupt No
1'
 isse jude ek sawaal par ravishankar prasad ne kaha, 'rahul gandhi pradhanmantri modi ko kya kya nahin kah rahe hai
 Once the Bofors story opened, they were upset
 kwatriko mamaa koun the? baat niklegi to dur talak jaaegi, bhrashtachar ke maamle main congress kaa itihaas jagajaahir he
 The party that the mps from Patna have gone to will have to answer
 garv he ki narendra modi kii aguwai main ek bhi bhrashtachar nahin hua he
 They spend 17–18 hours (labor) and we also spend time, thus the country has to move forward
 '2014 main 48 pratishat savarna vot bijepi ko mili the, argedy ko 23 fisadi or jediu ko 6 pratishat savarna vot mili the
 Political stalwarts believe that Kayastha vote banks have been committed voters of the BJP as well, so Kayastha votes cannot be widely distributed
 shatrughna sinha ko baaki jatiyon ke saath muslim vot mil sakate hai
 However, both the candidates have put their full emphasis in Patna Sahib
 8 may ko shatrughna sinha ne patna main road sho kiya to ravishankar prasad ne 26 april ko patna main dal bal ke saath road sho kiya
 While Ravi Shankar Prasad does not take any core effort to tear apart his opponents, his dilemma also started with the beginning of electoral politics
 darasal unke saamne hai shatrughna sinha, jo unke puraane mitra hai
 Ravi Shankar Prasad refrains from saying anything against him
 ravishankar prasad kii ye uljhan ekatarfa nahin he
 While Shatrughan Sinha also lashes out at the Modi government, Ravi Shankar refrains from directly attacking Prasad
 ravishankar prasad jepi andolan kii upaj hai
 Have reached the politics of the country from university politics
 1995 se bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main hai
 His importance can be known from the fact that if he was a minister in the Atal government, he was also a law minister in the Modi government
 chunaav bhale hi pehali baar lard rahe hai lekin siyasat main maahir hai
 They know that their first political fight is not easy
 shatrughna sinha netaa ke saath abhinayta bhi hai, do-do baar patna sahib ke saansad rahe hai
 Both giants are sweating for their victory, the war of giants has reached an interesting turn
 patna sahib seat par aakhri charan main 19 may ko matdaan hoga or nattejey aaenge 23 may ko
 Only then it will be decided who will prove to be the real hero of Patna Sahib

 It is believed about Jitiya Vrat that by doing this, Lord Jeevaatavahan protects him from all the problems faced by the son
 is vrath ko vivaahit mahilaayein karti hai
 It is believed that by doing this one also gets a son
 jitiya vrath kii kathanarmada nadi ke paas kanchanabati naam kaa nagar tha
 The king there was Malayaketu
 narmada nadike pashchim disha main marubhumi thi, jise baluhata kaha jaataa tha
 There was a huge Pakar tree
 us par chil rahati thi
 Under the tree was Khodhar, in which Siyarin lived
 chil or siaarin, donon main dosti thi
 Once both of them resolved to do Jitiya fast
 phir donon ne bhagwaan jiutvahan kii puja ke liye nirjalavratarkha
 On the day of the fast, the great businessman of that city died
 ab uskaa dah sanskaar usee marusthal par kiya gaya
 It was a dark night and it started pouring heavily
 kabhi bijli kadakati to kabhi badal garajte
 The storm had come
 siaarin ko ab bhukh lagane lagi thi
 Seeing the dead, she could not stop herself and her fast was broken

 With the blessings of Lord Jiutavahana, Sheelwati had seven sons
 par kapuravati ke sabhi bachche janm lete hi mar jate the
 After some time, the seven sons of Shilwati grew up
 ve sabhi raja ke darbar main kaam karne lage
 Kapuravati had a feeling of envy on seeing her
 usne raja se kahkar sabhi beton ke sar kaat die
 He ordered seven new utensils and placed them in it and covered it with red cloth and sent it to Shilwati
 yah dekhabhagwanjiutvahan ne mitti se saaton bhaaiyon ke sar banaae or sabhi ke sir ko uske dhad se jodakar un par amrit chhidak diya
 This brought them to life
 saaton yuvak jinda ho gaye or ghar laut aae
 The severed Sir Rani sent them became fruit
 duusari ore rani kapuravati, buddhisen ke ghar se soochna paane ko vyakul thi
 When information did not come for long, Kapuravati herself went to her elder sister's house
 vahaan sabko jinda dekhakar vah sann rah gayi
 When he regained consciousness, he told the sister everything
 ab use apni galati par pachhtaawaa ho rahaa tha
 By the grace of Lord Jiutavahana, Sheelwati remembered the things of her previous birth
 vah kapuravati ko lekar usee pakad ke ped ke paas gayi or use sari baaten bataayin
 Kapuravati fainted and died
 jab raja ko isaki khabar mili to unhone usee jagah par jaakar pakad ke ped ke neeche kapuravati kaa dah-sanskaar kar diya

 film kaa trailor khub tarife bator rahaa he, lekin film relies se pehle sensor board kii kanchi badi kaat-chhaant karne ke liye taiyaar he
 Prakash Jha, director of 'jai Gangaajal', who has always made films on political and social issues, is planning to go to court against the censor board's decision
 shyaam benegal kamity gathit hote hi ek baar phir sensor board ke khilaaf ek filmkaar ne aawaaj uthaai he
 Jha's 'jai Gangajal' story, describing Bihar's politics, police-administration and its social fabric, is set on the backdrop of Bihar and hence the dialect, style and jumle here are used in the film
 lekin, film ke relies hone se pehle hi sensor board ne film ko kai kats sujhaaye hai
 The comments sensor board chahta he ki film ke sound trek or drishyon ke un hisson ko hataaya jaae, jinamein maukhik or shaareerik hinsa dikhaai gai he
 By issuing a statement to the media, director Prakash Jha has expressed his displeasure against the censor board
 jha kehete hai ki sensor board ke do sadsy meri film ko 'e' certificate dena chaahate hai
 i cannot take 'A' certificate
 board kii revising kamity ne film dekhi or 11 kats ke saath wo mujhe 'yue' certificate dene ke liye raji hue
 The action scene has been asked to cut 50 percent
 seen tak to thik he, par film main istemaal hui bhashaa kii is tarah kaat-chhaant meri film ke liye galat he
 The word 'sala' is not such an abusive or objectionable word to be removed
 main tribunel jaaoongaa or vahaan bhi raahat nahin mili to court jane ke liye taiyaar hum
 When Jha's film 'gangajal' was made, it was still the BJP government and Ravi Shankar Prasad was the information and broadcasting minister

 But, even before the release of the film, the Censor Board has suggested several cuts to the film
 tippaniyan The censor board wants parts of the film's sound track and scenes in which verbal and physical violence is shown

 ection seen ko 50 pratishat kaatane ke liye kaha gaya he
 Even the scene is fine, but this kind of manipulation of the language used in the film is wrong for my film

 i will go to the tribunal and if there is no relief there then i am ready to go to court
 jab jha kii film 'gangaajal' bani thi, tab bhi bijepi kii hi sarkaar thi or ravishankar prasad soochna evam prasaaran mantri the
 In his statement, Jha said that the government had appreciated the film without major changes then

 1947 kii kranti par aadhaarit film 'junun' kii screening mumbai main ho rahe 16wein mumbai film festival main hui
 Naseeruddin Shah, who played the important character of Sarfaraz in the film, shared some things of personal life
 unhone is film ko karne kii 2 vajah bataai
 The first is that Naseer Saab was a big fan of foreign-origin actor 'geoffrey Kendall', with whom he had to do barely a 2-minute scene
 doosraa kaaran bataaya ki unhen actor kulbhushan kharbanda ke saath kismat se ek hi cameraa share nahin karnaa padaa, jisaki vajah se nasiruddin shah ko kulbhushan ke kharraaton se mukti mili
 Naseeruddin Shah said that he was exactly like his son Vivaan during the movie 'junoon', as he appears in Happy New Year
 nasiruddin shah ne bataaya kii wo hindi commercial filmein nahin dekhte, or baaki koi bhi cinema dekh lete hai
 Naseeruddin Shah said that in our country shouting and crying is called 'acting' which is wrong
 gauratlab he 'junun' film ke nirmaataa shashi kapur hai or nirdeshak shyaam benegal
 The film is based on the short stories of the famous writer Ruskin Bond

 The religious section of the census-2011 data which came just before the Bihar elections is going through the same tragedy in many cases
 in aankadon ko mukhyay rup se is tarah pesh kiya ja rahaa he jaise hindu aabaadi ghat rahi ho or muslim aabaadi bad rahi ho
 a view to see, there can be many more accurate ways of looking at it
 masalan agar yah kaha jaae ki 2001 se 2011 ke bich musalamaanon kii tulana memhinduon kii aabaadi chaar guna badito yah bhi tathyon par ekadam khari baat hogi
 Muslims number 3 in this decade
 4 karod or hinduon kii sankhya main 13
 8 crores increased
 isse spasht he ki bharat kii aabaadi main is dashak main jitne musalmaan jude hai usase chaar guna hindu jude hai
 The second fact is coming in the prevailing Mimamsa that the pace of growth of Muslim population is faster than the growth of Hindu population
 to isamen hamen apni rashtriya jansankhya niti ke hisaab se bhi soch lenaa chahie
 Accordingly, we are trying to control the population
 khaas baat yah he ki is disha main donon sampradaayon ke logon ne pahal kii or donon dharmon main jansankhya vruddhi kii raftaar pichley dashak kii vruddhi dar se kam hui he
 That is, despite all the misconceptions, it is certain that Muslims too agree with the philosophy of increasing the population at a faster pace
 musalamaanon kii saamaajik dasha kaa kyaminamekh nikaalane vaale yahaan bhi puch sakate hai ki aakhir musalmaan usee teji se jansankhya par brake kyon nahin laga rahe hai, jis tarah hindu
 So, they should also keep an eye on the Sachar Committee report
 iske mutabik kai maamalon membharat ke musalamanonki dasha daliton kii aarthik saamaajik dasha se gai gujri he
 Their share in government jobs is also low in proportion to the population
 yah bhi maani hui baat he ki jansankhya niyantran or aarthik saamaajik str main uthaan kaa sidhaa rishta he
 The illiterate and poor society in India still has a different perception about the population than the middle class families
 ho saktaa he sarkaar bhavishya main jab jati aadhaarit janaganana ke aankade jari kare to pataa chale ki vanchit jatiyon or sampann jatiyon main jansankhya ko lekar kis tarah ke trend hai
 In the absence of data, it is seen from everyday experience that even today, poor families are not completely cut off from the notion that the more hands they earn
 jabaki madhyam varg sochataa he ki jitne kam bachche honge, utana behatar laalan-paalan
 However, this class is also surrounded by the difference between son and daughter
 baharhaal yah sochane kii jarurat he ki nirjeev aankadon ko sajivamanavjaati ke liye anaavashyak chunautike taur par pesh na kiya jaae
 It is better to think of how to make the backward people an equal partner in the path of progress than to hoist the figures like a stump or a hikarat
 jis din tarakkee ke aankade sab dharmon ke liye ek se aane lagenge, ho saktaa he us din jansankhya vruddhi ke aankade bhi jati-dharm-kshetra kii bandishon se pare hokar ek se aa jaaen

 He managed the senior officers of the Indian Nursing Council so well that only the right to give government approval to all nursing colleges in Rajasthan came into his hands
 unhone health care pramotars ko itani khubsuurati se manage kiya ki jab tak manachaahi rakam se unki hatheli garm nahin hoti kaagaj aage hi nahin badhate
 He managed ministers and government officials so brilliantly that when the Rajasthan anti-corruption Bureau paid him five lakh rupees on 30 June
 kii rishwat lete hue range haathon pakadaa to dhamkaane vaale phone dhadadhad aane lage
 Welcome to the Republic of the Right Pocket Warmer

 isaki ek jhalak jahaan shuukravaar ko dekhne ko mili jab mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne apni party kii baithak main jahaan giriraaj singh kaa naam liye bina kaha ki jo log gathbandhan main khachapach karne main lage hai unako vidhansabha chunaav ke baad jawaab milegaa or saath hi yah bhikaha ki kuch log mere kilaaf bayaan dete hai or jab milte hai to kehete hai ki chhapane ke liye aisa karte hai
 On this, Giriraj immediately responded by tweeting
 unhone twit karte hue kaha, 'mahadev kii dayaa se jo mujhe sahi lagata bolta hum, naa kisi ke aage bolta naa peeche bolta hum or jo bolta hum us par adig rahata hum
 In the meeting of JDU, Nitish Kumar said some such things that broke Giriraj Singh and Tejashwi Yadav, but on Tejashwi Yadav, he said that those who do not know politics, they only keep making statements
 tab tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki tab unhen up mukhyamantri kyon banaaya
 Tejashwi challenged Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday and said that if he had so much confidence in his development then why would he not contest elections alone
 phir tejasvi ne giriraaj singh kii tarafadaari karte hue nitish kumaar se poocha ki jin khach baj karne waalon ko wo chunaav baad karrwai karne kii chetavanee de rahe hai to chunaav se purv himmat he to karrwai kyon nahin kar lete?media se naaraaz nitish kumaar bole- jo man main aae chhaapie yaa na chhaapie mujhe publicity kii koi jarurat nahinvahin shanivaar ko kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ne begusarai main aae sookhe or baadh ke bahaane mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko phir gherne kii koshish kii or apane zile kii sthiti ko lekar chintaa zaahir karte hue kaha ki jab begusarai main barish nalanda se kam hui he tab nalanda kaise suukhaagrast ghoshit ho gaya or begusarai ko kaise chhod diya gaya
 It is clear from Giriraj's attitude that rain or drought is an excuse, all he has to do is put Nitish Kumar at the center of his criticism
 janata dal united (jediu) ke netaaon ne giriraaj ke bayaan par pratikriya dene se inkaar kar diya he
 Saddened by the statements of the BJP leaders, Nitish said that the 'spenders' in the alliance will be in a bad state after the assembly elections but BJP leaders also believe that the way Giriraj and Tejashwi are harmonizing with each other in the statements Nitish Kumar will ultimately benefit
 nitish kumaar ko agar yadav or bhoomihaar jati ke netaa milakar yaa alag-alag nishane par rakhte hai to nitish ke paramparaagat voter khaaskar gair yadav, pichhadaa, ati pichhadaa or mahadalit or adhik lamaband hote hai jisaki misaal 2010 main dekhne ko mili
 On the one hand Lalu Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan were challenging him, on the other hand, in his own party, the opponent Lalan Singh had written and commanded the propaganda of the Congress party and he also attacked Nitish Kumar forgetting all the limitations in speaking

 Sri Lankan acting captain Lasith Malinga said that Virat Kohli is a great batsman, but he has bowlers who can bowl a ball that even the greatest player gets out
 bharat ke khilaaf isisi tii-20 world cap ke final kii purv sandhya par malinga ne kaha, ham sabhi ko pataa he ki viraat behtareen khilaadi he, lekin mahanatam khilaadi ko out karne ke liye bhi sirf ek gend kii jarurat hoti he
 i am confident that someone from our team will bowl this good ball
 jab kisi ne poocha ki kya is mukaable ko kohli banaam malinga mana ja saktaa he, to srilanka ke captain ne ise adhik mahatv nahin diya
 He said, we have to strategize about all 20 overs
 unke paas chah yaa saat achche ballebaaj hai
 We are not thinking of dismissing any one batsman
 hamen 20 achche over phenkane par dhyaan dena hoga, lekin agar use acchhee gend phenki jaati he, to vah bhi out ho saktaa he
 Malinga also did not pay attention to Sri Lanka's victory over India in the practice match
 malinga ne kaha, abhyaas match hameshaa abhyaas match hi hota he
 But the competition in the tournament is different mentally and physically
 final bada match he or tanaav bilkul alag tarah kaa he
 The one who plays well on match day can win
 malinga ne kaha, main kabhi kisi match ko khud ko sabit karne ke iraade se nahin utarataa
 There are other players in my team who can work for the team
 jaisaa ki maine kaha koi bhi acchhee gend phenk saktaa he or wicket hasil kar saktaa he
 No matter how good the batsman is, he needs a ball to get out
 malinga ne kaha ki vah mahendra singh dhoni ke saath toss karne utrenge
 In response to a question, Malinga said, "I will be the captain on Sunday
" pehle kuch maichon main chandimal ne acha netritv kiya
 He is an emerging player
 lahiru ko mauka mila or usne sabit kiya ki vah kitna acha khilaadi he
 We have not yet decided about our team
 hamen pich dekhni hogi or phir faisla karenge ki hamen kaisaa sangyojan chahie

 The government does not care about the corridors that connect the sanctuaries and facilitate movement of tigers
 ve kahati hai, “inke bagaiyr baaghon kii aabaadi alag-thalag pad jaaegi, pidiyon ke dauraan inamen anuvanshik badlaav aa jaaenge or ye lupt hone ke kagaar par pahunch jaaenge

 Despite this, tiger-centric tourism is under threat
 abhilash bhaskar bataate hai, “july 2012 main jab supreme court ne aise paryaton par purna pratibandh laga diya tha taaki baaghon ko bachaaya ja sake, tab sangrakshanvidon ne iske khilaaf daleel di thi ki isse vanyajeevon kii taskari main ijapha hoga kyonki tab shikari nidar hokar khuleam gum sakenge ki unhen koi nahin dekh rahaa he

 One day in a forest inhabited by forests between Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, she was suddenly seen one day last year, which made the villagers panic
 bhor main chaar baje 21 saal ke ek yuvak ke nityakarm ke liye kheton main jane or maare jane ke baad se hi is gaanv par aatank kaa saaya tha
 There were uproar in the village after ten deaths in seven weeks
 logon ne van vibhaag kii chaiki ko gher liya or kanoon apane haath main lene kii dhamkee dene lage
 People shouted, "give us the gun, we will kill the tigress
 ”iske baad baghin achaanak gaayab ho gai
 The tigress could not get caught in the trap of gunmen and money
 koi bhi jaal, haathiyon kaa pataa lagane vaale upkaran yaa hawaii drone tak uskaa pataa nahin laga sake
 After all, where did the tigress disappear? According to the forest officials of Uttar Pradesh, she had moved to the border of Uttarakhand
 gaanvvaalon kii maane to uske bacchon or nar saathi ko shikariyon ne apana nishaanaa banaaya tha jisaki dushmani nikaalane ke liye vah khun kii pyaasi ho gai thi or vahiin chali gai thi jahaan se ai thi
 The trackers who traced her said that she might have found a new companion and she might have left with him
 sangrakshakon kaa maananaa tha ki shaayad gaanvvaalon ne badla lene ke liye use jehar de diya hoga
 Munni Devi angrily shouts at Rakesh Kumar, "gauwan chhodi aye, akhtiyar hai to mara" means you can kill or else leave the village and leave
 rakesh kehete hai, “jab kabhi baagh dikhataa he, ye log mere upar gussa ho jate hai
 “amidst the news of stray tigers, the villagers continue to feed their cattle as before and are engaged in farming
 ve kehete hai, “har koi baagh se nafrat karata he, phir bhi ve usase dur nahin rah sakate
 People living around the shared national sanctuaries of villages and forests depend on them for their livelihood
 yah nirbharta zyaadaatar jalaavan kii lakdi or chaare ke liye hoti he

 Local leaders believe that there should be alternative sources of income in areas where industries are not available due to lack of environmental clearances

 People should also be provided facilities and support for irrigation, subsidized LPG and farm fencing
 lobiyon kaa khelbaagh sangrakshan ko alag-alag lobbiyaan bhi mushkil bana rahi hai
 For example, the recent transfer of T24 from Ranthambore in Rajasthan has divided wildlife lovers into two factions
 tii-24 ke samarthan main fasebuk par kai samooh ubhar aae hai, jaise help tii24, mishan tii24, seve me tii24, ustad da tiger, vagairah
 In Ranthambore, people across the country are taking out candle marches, holding dharna, giving applications to the President and demonstrating in order to bring back T24
 duusari ore tii24 ke sthanantaran ke faisle kaa samarthan karne vaale log aise video aplod kar rahe hai jinamein rampal singh or ghisu singh naamak do van prahariyon ke parijanon ke bayaan hai jinhen tii24 ne maar diya tha
 They have threatened to stage demonstrations if T24 is returned
 bada sawaal yah he ki aakhir rajasthan sarkaar ne tii-24 ko sthanantarit karne kaa faisla itani jaldi main kyon liya or kyon nahin central ju athurity or antisie se baatcheet karne kaa rasta apanaaya? ise samajhane ke liye hamen ranthambhore main sakriy tamaam dhadon kii padtaal kerani hogi
 One lobby is quite aristocratic, represented by the famous tiger expert Valmik Thapar, his nephew Jaisal Singh, who runs the Sherbagh resort on the periphery of the national sanctuary (whose backyard is occasionally spotted by tigers), the Oberoi group's wild villas and others
 is samooh ko paise vaale or abhijatya paryatakon ke kaaphi kareeb mana jaataa he or inaki netaaon tak pahunch bhi he
 For example, Jaisal Singh has a family relationship with Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, including Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi
 na keval thapar balki kai sthaneey or anya ahm vanyajeev visheshgyon tathaa swayamsevi sansthaaon ke saath bhi is lobby ke kareebi rishte hai, jinamein kai ke hotel kaarobaar ke saath hit jude hai or visheshgy guide ke taur par shulk lekar paryatakon ko ghumaate hai
 Against this faction, the other faction in Ranthambore continues to accuse hotel owners of violating standards
 vanya vilaas ne jalarashiyon ko hotalon ke kaaphi kareeb banaaya taaki baagh or anya vanyajeev vahaan pani pine aaen to sailaani unhen dekh saken
 Efforts by the state government to monitor new hotels and open new regular areas are quite low
 alag-alag dhade aksar bhinn paksh lete rahe hai
 It depends on how they are able to maintain nexus with the forest management
 inaki aapasi ranjish se ve peshewar vanyajeev chhayakaar tak batch nahin paae hai jo khud ko vanyajeev premi kehete hai

 Many Kashmiri youth caught the path of terror In 2015, this picture became viral as well as a means of propaganda for terrorists in Kashmir and it is believed that after this picture went viral on social media, many Kashmiri youth The terrorists joined the group, taking the path of terrorism

 This was the first time in the nearly three decades of terrorism in Kashmir when together 11 terrorists were also seen in pictures in a very good and armed manner

 Operation All Out is going on from the army and security forces in Kashmir, but experts believe that to eliminate terrorism, killing the terrorists is necessary to overcome the problems that create terrorism

 On Thursday, there was news of infection in Kidilip Kumar's kidney but as of now there is no improvement in his health
 pichley chaar dinon se mumbai ke bandra ilaake main admit hone ke baavjood ab tak koi bhi bollywood actor unase milane leelavati aspataal nahi pahunchaa he
 About 5 to 10 minutes away from the hospital where Dilip Kumar is admitted, there are many Bollywood stars, which include the names of many big actors including Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Sanjay Dutt, Rekha, Jackie Shroff, Naseeruddin Shah
 haalanki isaki ek vajah ye bhi he ki viviipi guest ke aane se aspataal prashasan kii jimmedaari or bad jaati he

 samachar agency ieenes kii cricket website-cricketgenetic se baat karte hue ek sutara ne kaha ki khilaadiyon ke liye book kiye gaye hotalon ke gym main unki jaruraton ke lihaaj se paryaapt equipment nahin hai or isiilie bhartiya khilaadiyon ko privet gym main workout karne ke liye alag se paas muhaiyaa karaayaa gaya he
 The source, who is aware of the entire matter, said, 'yes, the equipment kept in team hotels is not enough
 bhartiya khilaadi in dinon privet gym main workout kar rahe hai kyonki ve vahiin apni jarurat or match ke anusaar workout kar sakate hai
 'this is not the only problem that the players are grappling with
 vishwa cap jaise event main pehle din se hi khilaadiyon ko is tarah kii suvidha muhaiyaa karai jaani chahie ki ve sabakuch bhuulakar sirf apni fitness or match par dhyaan de saken
 Apart from this, there are many other problems
 You can make these situations your nightmare or use it an opportunity to bounce back

 BSP chief Mayawati intensified attacks on opponents as soon as the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh drew near
 purv mukhyamantri mayawati ne somvaar ko press conference kar piem modi se lekar sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Mayawati even said that the future of the alliance between the Samajwadi Party and the Congress in UP depends on the BJP
 mayawati saal 2012 se upi kii satta se baahar hai
 In November, when PM Modi announced demonetisation, it was said that this step of the central government will benefit him in the UP elections
 daawa kiya gaya ki chunaavon main paise kaa khel ab nahin chalegaa, aise main dhan-bal ke boote jeetne vaali partiyon ko notebandi kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 Not only the BSP, the ruling Samajwadi Party of the state and the Congress also attacked the Modi government for the decision of demonetisation
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki notebandi se in tinonpartiyon ke bheetar bechainihai
 People of these parties are engaged in changing notes on commission and are conspiring to mislead the public about demonetisation
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki notebandi ke faisle se janata ko pareshaani jarur ho rahi he lekin yah ummid bhi he ki ise janata kaa samarthan mil rahaa he or bhagava party ko isse chunaavon main phayda hoga
 Now Mayawati is saying that the SP alliance in UP is under pressure from BJP
 mayawati ne press conference main kaha, 'congress or sapa ke gathbandhan kaa aakhri faisla bijepi ke nafe, nuksaan or ishaare par hi hoga
 Mayawati said that the BJP will give the green signal for the alliance and it will show it only when it feels that it will definitely benefit from the alliance in the elections
 basapa supremeo ne aarope lagaaya ki piem modi kii aguwai vaali centre sarkaar idi, inakam tex or sibiai kii madad se mulaayam singh yadav par congress se gathjod ke liye dabaav bana rahi he
 It is worth noting here that the reality is contrary to the kind of allegation that Mayawati is giving to Mulayam
 mayawati or mulaayam, donon hi aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle ko lekar charchaa main rahe hai
 The latest situation is that the SP chief has got relief from the Supreme Court in the matter of disproportionate assets while the top court has agreed to hear against Mayawati in a similar case
 yahi nahin, inakam tex vibhaag ne mayawati ke bhai anand kumaar ke khilaaf benami sampatti ke maamle main jaanch shuru kar di he
 In such a situation, Mayawati's resentment over PM Modi and SP chief can also be seen in view of her party's prospects in the upcoming elections
 vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar ab tak hue opinian pole mayawati kii party ko tisare number dikhaa rahe hai
 Mayawati also fears that the sp-congress alliance will reduce her hopes of returning to power
 basapa is baar ke chunaav main muslim votaron par daav lagane kii taiyaari main he
 If the SP and Congress combine, then it will not be easy for the BSP to make a dent in the Muslim vote bank
 Disha Vakani quit show tivi ke popular sho tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma ke phens ke liye buree khabar he
 Actress Disha Wakani, who plays Daya Ben's famous character in the show, will not be seen in the show
 lambey vakt se disha, sho se gaayab hai
 It was being said that she would return, but now it was confirmed that the actress has decided to leave the show
 tarak mehta ke sho ne disha ghar ghar main pahchaan dilaai
 Disha was away from the show after giving birth to her daughter
 unhone delivery ke baad sho par vaapasi bhi kii, lekin bich-bich main brake leti raheen
 Due to the break, the show was severely affected
 spotby kii report ke mutabik, mekars or disha ne finali tay kiya ki disha sho ko chhod dengi
 It is also said that many of his special shots have been shot before leaving the show
 in shots ko sho ke bich bich main philler kii tarah yuj kiya jayega

 After the birth of the daughter, she wants to give more time to her family
 yahi vajah he ki disha ab profeshnal life se dur personal life main maa kii jimmedaari nibhaane kii taiyaari main hai
 When the star cast was asked about Disha Wakani's saying Alvida from the show, the cast refused to comment
 haalanki disha kii sho par vaapasi ko lekar abhi koi oficial anounsament nahin hui he
 But it can be assumed that Dayaben will not be a part of the show in the coming days
 kendriya shaikshanik sanstha (shikshak ke coder main aarakshan) vidheyak 2019 loksabhaa main somvaar ko paas ho gaya he
 According to this, reservation will be implemented in central educational institutions by considering university or college as a unit instead of a department
 iske baad ab desh bhar main shikshakon kii niyuktiyaan hongi or aarakshan diya jayega
 In 2017, the Allahabad High Court gave an order to the Banaras Hindu University (BHU)
 jisamen kaha gaya tha ki department ko unit maanakar aarakshan kii gananaa kii jaae or uske aadhaar par anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ko aarakshan diya jaae
 Which was also cleared by the Supreme Court in 2018
 lekin is bill ke paas hone ke baad ab aarakshan department kii jagah vishvavidhyalay yaa college ko unit maanakar lagu kiya jayega
 The Central Educational Institutions (reservation in teacher cadre) Bill 2019 also provides for reservation of poor teachers of general category in higher educational institutions
 haalanki march 2019 main jo adhyadesh lagu kiya gaya tha, usamen inke liye aarakshan kaa praavdhaan nahin tha
 After the bill is passed in both houses, the President will go for approval
 sarkaar daawa kar rahi he ki iske baad 7000 shikshakon kii niyukti kaa rasta saaf ho jayega
 According to what Billbill says, now instead of considering a department as a unit, the central educational institution will be considered a unit
 kendriya shaikshanik santhaan ke rup main ve santhaan aate hai jisaki sthapana or funding centre sarkaar ke dwaara hoti he
 An example of this is the Banaras Hindu University
 bill kaa praavdhaan anusandhan sansthaanon, rashtriya or samrik mahatv ke sansthaanon main lagu nahin hoga
 The eighth schedule of the bill states that there are 8 institutions to which this will not apply
 sarkaar bataa chuki he ki kendriya shaikshanik sansthaanon main khaali padon par bhartee ke liye 2019-20 or 2020-21 ke liye 717
 83 crore has been allocated
 department ko unit maanane par pratinidhitiv kam hogounusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ke shikshak lagaataar is baat kii guhaar lagaate rahe hai ki ucch shikshan sansthaanon main unka pratinidhitiv kam he
 The All India Survey for Higher Education (AISE) was conducted by the Ministry of Human Resources in 2017-18
 iske mutabik kul shikshakon kii sankhya 12,84,755 thi
 In which general class teachers 56
 8 fisadi the
 While Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes represent 8 respectively
 6 fisadi or 2
 Was 27 percent
 jabaki obisi kaa pratinidhitiv 32
 Was 3 percent
 survey main yah baat saamne ai ki department ko unit maanakar aarakshan dene main arakshit virgon kaa pratinidhitiv or ghatega, jabaki uniwarsity yaa college ko unit maanane par unka pratinidhitiv badhegaa
 Currently 15 per cent for Scheduled Castes, 7 for Scheduled Tribes
 5 fisadi or obisi ke liye 27 fisadi aarakshan kaa praavdhaan he
 In such a situation, if 1 post is vacant in a department, reservation in its recruitment is not applicable, because it will be considered 100 percent
 udhaaharan ke taur par yadi kisi department main 6 pad khaali hai or agar ek anusuchit jati kii bhartee hoti he to vah 16
 There will be 6 percent reservation
 aise main ek anusuchit jati kii bhartee ke liye kam se kam 7 pad hone chahie

 Bottom line: After reading a novel written analytical article on the eleven most beautiful works of Gupta, it is automatically proved that he is a great poet of Hindi
 par unki kavitaaon main antarnihit saamaajikta or vaicharikta kii gahari chaanbin nahin kii gai he
 At a time when the trend of preparing a critique book by storing periodical review essays is in full swing, Nandkishore Naval is among the few critics of Hindi who still maintains his sincerity and loyalty to criticism work are put
 usee kaa sufal he maithilisharan naam kii yah pustak
 In it, he presented his vivid and systematic study by keeping the poetry of Maithilisharan Gupta
 muktibodh or niraala par isi tarah kaa vyavasthit adhyayan ve prastut kar chuke hai
 In this book, Naval has analyzed the entire poetry of Gupta ji as far as possible
 unhone kavy saundarya kii drushti se mahatvapurn gupt kii choti-choti kavy-pustakon kaa bhi vivechan ek bade lekh main kiya he
 But the highlight of the book are the eleven articles under which the eleven most beautiful works of the Guptas are comprehensive study of Jayadratha Slaughter, Panchavati, Saket, Jai Bharat, Yashodhara, Vishnupriya, Dwapara, Siddharaj, bharata-bharati, swadesh-sangeet and Jhankar- Has been analyzed
 ise padhane ke baad pathak kii drushti main gupt apni virat kavy-samvednaa or rachanaatmak prayogon ke aadhaar par swatah hi khadi boli hindi ke mahatvapurn kavi siddh hote hai
 There is no need for the critic to say anything separately in this context
 maithilisharan gupt aadhunik kaal main ab tak ke sarvaadhik lokapriy kaviyon main hai
 As far as the Hindi reader is concerned, he has accepted him as his ethnic poet from the beginning
 unki mahanata ko lekar hindi pathak ke man main kabhi koi andeh nahin rahaa
 Doubt was planted by critics who grossly undervalued Gupta by creating a meaningless division of 'historical importance vs
 literary importance' and 'popularity vs
 superiority' and placing him in the ranks of the poet of historical importance and popularity
 naval is pustak main aise vibhaajan or uske falswaroop hindi aalochana main unke saath kiye gaye saluk kaa datakar virodh karte hai
 He says, "it is impossible that no poet is important from a literary point of view and that he deserves immortality in history
" duusare, yah bhi asambhav he ki koi kavi bhaashan dekar yaa lekh likhakar kavita kii dhara ko mode de
 
 
 It needs to be said again and again that the Guptas, by their infinite creation-ability, paved the way for poetic creation in a standing dialect and gave it new dimensions
 ''naval ne is baat ko vishwasaneey tareeke se dikhaaya he ki kavy-saundarya kii drushti se bhi unki kritiyaan kahin se bhi kamatar nahin
 But as often happens, every achievement also becomes a limitation in another context
 is kitaab main gupt kii kavitaaon se lambey-lambey uddhran dekar aadyant dikhaaya gaya he ki unki rachanaaen kavitv se paripurna hai
 But the socialism and ideology inherent in his poems have not been investigated deeply and extensively
 agar aisa kiya jaataa to yah maithilisharan gupt par ek samgr aalochana pustak hoti
 An interesting incident has come to light in Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's constituency Amethi
 pulicekarmi ne ek shaks se ghoose ke rupee to liye, par baad main waapas kar die
 The case pertains to the village of Otia in the Shivrataganj police station area of amethi
 ek haraa ped kaatane ke maamle main inhona police chaowkee incharge mahesh chandra ne maamle ko rafa-dfa karne ke liye thekedaar taj mohammad urf taju se 15,000 rupee vasuul kiye, magar aiji se shikaayat karne ke baad usne 13,000 rupee waapas kar die
 Actually, Nafees Khan of Otia village informed ASP Munna Lal and SP Amethi Heera Lal about the case
 nafis kaa kahana he ki in adhikariyon ne karrwai karne ke bajaay chaowkee incharge ke marfat thekedaar se moti rakam vasuul kar maamle ko rafa-dfa karne kaa prayaas kiya
 After this Nafees complained to IG Amitabh Thakur
 thakur ne aiji (lakhanu jone) subhash chandra se shikaayat karne ke saath khud maukey par jaakar jaanch kii
 According to sources, the outpost incharge returned Rs 13,000 to the contractor
 iske baad nafis ne phir aiji se shikaayat kii ki chaowkee incharge ne us par or thekedaar par apana bayaan badalane kaa dawaab banaaya
 Now IG Thakur has made DGP AL Banerjee aware of these facts and demanded an inquiry at his level

 Big hitter Yusuf Pathan, who made a place in the Indian team due to IPL, 16 for India in 16 matches
 40 kii ausat se 164 ran hi bana paye hai lekin rajasthan rails ke liye unhone 43 match main 26
 Has scored 1011 runs at an average of 60
 sirf dhoni or pathan hi bharat kii taraf se khelte hue ipel kii tarah pradarshan nahin kar paye balki isisi twanti-20 vishwa cap ke liye bhartiya team main shaamil anya star khilaadiyon harbhajan singh, gautam gambhir, suresh raina, jahir khan, dinesh karthik, murali vijay aadi kaa antarrashtriya twanti-20 or ipel ke pradarshan main fark saaf dikh jayega
 If these stars of India performed like the IPL in the Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies, then perhaps the team would not have to look out after losing all three matches in the Super Eight
 chayankarta bhi bhavishya main is par gaur karke ho saktaa he ki team ke chayan main ipel ke pradarshan ko adhik tavajjo na den kyonki adhiktar khilaadiyon ke pradarshan main ipel jaisi patibaddhta nahin dikhi

 koi soch nahin saktaa tha ki is chunaav main, congress sirf apane raajnneetik swaarth ke liye bharat ke samvidhan ko chot pahunchane kaa hin krity karegi
 This election has influenced my mind
 'congress ne chalaa daanvbata den, karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke badalte rujhaanon ke bich congress abhi himmat nahin haari he
 The Congress is currently the second largest party in the trends after the BJP
 bijepi bahumat se thodaa peeche rahati dikh rahi he or congress karnataka main kam se kam ek baar sarkaar banane kii koshish karnaa chaahati he
 Under this, Kumaraswamy has also met the Governor

 He further said that in the evening, the governor will be presented with a claim to form the government

 kisi ne bhi aapatti nahin jataai
 Now they have come up with new demands which are not acceptable to us
 ''amit shah (amit Shah) ne kaha ki raashtrapati shashan laganaa isliye jaruri tha ki aisa aarope lag saktaa tha ki bhartiya janata party kii tempereri sarkaar chal rahi he
 He said that anyone, even today, can approach the Governor to form the government
 unhone kaha ki is mudde par vipaksh kori raajnneeti kar rahaa he
 This is not a healthy tradition for democracy
 jinhen mauka chahie unke paas aaj bhi mauka he
 On the contrary, those who asked for two days were given six months time
 rajyapal mahoday ne sabko chah maheene kaa samay de diya he sarkaar banane kaa
 He said that i believe the Governor has done the right thing
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki raashtrapati shashan aane se agar kisi kaa nuksaan hua he to vah bhartiya janata party kaa hua he, kyonki hamaari keretekar sarkaar chali gai he
 The loss is not due to opposition
 agar wo chaahate hai ki is prakaar kii bhranti paidaa karke desh kii janata kii hamadardi paae to mujhe lagata he ki is desh kii janata kii samaj par unako bharosa nahin he

 Taapsee has expressed grief over his removal from the film
 saath hi unhone bataaya ki film se nikaale jane ke bare main unhen kuch nahin bataaya gaya or bina bataae hi kisi or ko le liya gaya tha
 When i asked the reason for this, i was not told the exact reason
 bataa den ki pati patni or wo 1978 main relies hui thi
 The film starred Sanjeev Kumar in the lead role
 is film kaa nirdesan baldev raaj chopra ne kiya tha
 The film's lead roles also starred Vidya Sinha and Ranjita Kaur
 aap chaahate to hai ki bhagwaan kii puja-paath karne ke dauraan unhen har din behad sundar, taaja or ekadam sugandhit phool arpit kiye jaaen
 But the problems in raising them are many
 phool kharidne jaaen, to pataa chalegaa ki ye bhi mahangaai kii chot khaae baithe hai
 Coming from this market to that market, from this market to this market, their petals have got many marks of stress and fatigue
 jab daaliyon par jhum rahe the, tab to khushboo kii bhi koi seemaa na thi
 But as soon as the dealers came in the hands, the fragrance also decreased
 agarbatti kharidne jaaen, to bhi jhamela
 No brand suits, no one can pocket it
 jo pocket main samaata, usamen ‘gandh’ to he, par ‘su’ gaayab
 If you find Ganga water in the house to sprinkle on the gods and goddesses, that too is missing
 aakhir ek chote-se paatr main salbhar se rakhaa gangaajal kab tak chalegaa
 
 
 It means that there are many problems in the things that we want to offer physically to our Ishtadeva
 dhan kii kami, vakt kii kami, uplabdhta kii samasyaayein aadi
 What is the diagnosis? If God is pleased then how? The solution is very simple and simple
 hamaare shastron main maanas puja kii bahut mahima gaai gai he
 Manas puja means mind to mind, praising God carefully, offering flowers, sandalwood, perfumes, clothes, naivedya etc
 to them from the mind
 yahaan yah spasht kar dena jaruri he ki maanas puja kisi laachaari main apanaai jane vaali puja-paddati nahin he
 It is mentioned in the scriptures that this type of worship is also most loved by God
 bhagwaan kinhin sansaarik chizon ke nahin, balki bhav ke bhukhe hote hai
 The relationship between the devotee and God is intensified only through feelings
 mudgalpurana main kaha gaya he:kritvadu maanaseen puujaan tat: puujaan samacharet
 It is being told that if worship is to be done with external things, then also manas puja should be done first
 sabase acchhee baat to yah he ki maanas puja main aapaki soch kii koi seemaa nahin hoti
 You can offer beautiful, fresh and fragrant flowers to your Ishta Dev
 yahaan na to phulon kii keemat aapke man ko malin karti he, na hi iske basi padane kii ashanka sataati he
 Similarly, anywhere from Gangotri to Gangasagar, Ganga water becomes available in seconds, as much as you want
 isi tarah anya kalpit chijen aapako hameshaa taiyaar milti hai
 The greatest feature of Manas Puja is that as long as the seeker is engaged in these works with the mind, the longer he remains disconnected from worldly things
 is tarah kii puja se bhagwaan to bahut-bahut tusht hote hi he, sadhak bhi dhyaan kii avasthaa main aa jaataa he
 After all, this is also the aim of worship

 vikaas ne donon ke khilaaf na sirf ek negative campan chalaane kii baat kahi he, balki yah bhi kaha he ki yah dikhaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he ki jaise "phantum films" ke band hone kaa kaaran vikaas hi hai
 Alok Nathvikas, accused of drug abuse, will take legal action against Vinata's allegations, Anurag, who is maligning my name, said, "there is an attempt to show that the company has been shut down because of them, while the truth is that they Everyone was in talks about their separation for a few months
 vikaas ne yah notice apane vakil shamsher dwaara bheja he
 It is also said in the notice that Anurag has done all this work by bribing a member of his own company
 taaki vah vikaas ke khilaaf sexual herracement ke ek or aarope lagaae
 "vikas has also made it clear that they had been discussing for a few months that the four would split up; we had already had a lot of creative differences between the four
 notice main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki saal 2017 main isi mudde par anuraag kashyap ke die gaye statement main or ab die gaye statement ek-duusare se bilkul alag hai
 The notice also states that last month Motwani met Vikas Bahl and showed a screenshot of the conversation with the alleged victim in which he denied any incident of sexual assault
 bataa den ki phantum films ko anuraag kashyap, vikramaditya motwani, vikaas bahal or madhu mantena ne 2011 is production house kii sthapana kii thi
 We are together that the charge of the crew member - 'I was taking off clothes in front of me, Alok Nathye hai
 Anurag's latest statement, seeing the growth of Bahl's case, Anurag Kashyap has issued another statement
 isamen unhone kaha, "main MAMI ke board of member kii sabhi duty se apana naam waapas letaa hum
 The second thing is that i reject all the allegations according to which i never took any action on the case in 2015
 khaastaur se main un logon ko safai nahin dena chahta hum jo kanoonee niyamon ko nahin samajhate hai
 “I work with a lot of women, many women work with me

 They are all witnesses to my action
 ""ye aisa vakt he jab hamen apane andar jhaank kar dekhnaa or sochna chahie ki kaise in sabakaa saamana karen
 "anurag says," With the passage of time, i have learned this in a straightforward way that the line of consent is not defined by saying "no"
 kai baar sahmati us vyakti par nirbhar karti he jo ise de rahaa hota he, iskaa maalik hota he
 It has different definitions according to the people

 Many people on Twitter are strongly opposed to Honey Singh, while many say that freedom of expression should be respected
 sivam garg ne twitor par likhaa he ki hani ke khilaaf praathmiki darj hona aisa lag rahaa he ki bhartiya vyavastha raper or raper (balaatkaari) ko lekar bhramit he
 Rapper Honey Singh, who became popular with the song 'english Beat' from Saif Ali Khan-starrer 'kakatel', was embroiled in controversy following the Delhi gang rape case

 Although people on the internet are divided on this issue

 Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap also defended Honey Singh, saying that if the country believes that there are rapes due to Honey Singh , then let me also say something
 main khadey hokar kahuunga ki aap nahin jaanate ki aap kya kar rahe hai, bheed kii tarah vyavhaar kar rahe hai or phir jo kuch bhi kisi ko pareshaan karata he, use pratibandhit hona chahie
 Kashyap said that the more we become moral and try to control expression, the more oppression will occur

 One person wrote that if the song of Honey Singh is Bhadkau then item song ('main to Tandoori Hen Hoon Yaar, Gatkale Saiyan Alcohol') from Kareena Kapoor of (dabangg 2) is less annoying

 Memoirs of Acharya Acharya's Memoirs of Hansabalaka Acharya Jankivallabh Shastri Kitabaghar Publications, New Delhi, Price: 675 Rs
 kitabgharprakashan@gmail
 com Janaki Vallabh Shatri, who once wrote a poem in Sanskrit, gave many works in Hindi to the literary world with the inspiration of Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' in Geeti Natya, story, novel, criticism and memoir etc
 lekin sahitya ke itihaas or aalochana kii 'charchaa’ main unka naam is seemaa tak alpagyaat he ki hindi kaa saamaanya pathak to kya, shodh-vidhyaarthee bhi unke naam or kaam se lagbhag aparichit hai
 The author of novels like Kalidas, epics like Radha and critical works like Sahitya Darshan can also remain unfamiliar and unfamiliar in this way, perhaps only in Hindi
 shastri ke shishy or aalochak gopeshwar singh ne unke samooche sahitya ko prakaash main laane kaa sankalp liya he
 This is the re-publication of his memoir, Hansbalaka, published from the book house as the first episode of the same
 hansbalaka aadhe se zyada shastri kii aatmakatha ke rup main he
 The memorial portraits of Prasad, Nirala, Premchand, Agnayya, Jainendra and Hazari Prasad Dwivedi reveal many untargeted aspects of these litterateurs
 prasad-premchand se ek saath milane kaa shastri hi aisa varnan kar sakate hai— ''yahaan prasad or premchand” donon ek-se gore ek-se prabhaavshaalee vyaktitv ke vyakti itane paas-paas baithe the
 Prasad's face full, uncertain, resentful and resentful, Premchand's dry face, inner wrinkles sorting out wrinkles, bright eyes on his way to the destination
 beshak hansi-thahaake kii ek hode-si machi thi, parantu palada premchand kaa har baar baari padataa tha
 Premchand's laughter was like a sweltering blow from the sea churning, and liquid waves rising from the serene floor of Prasadji's lake
 ” yah uddhran shastri kii anupam bhashaa or style kii misaal bhar nahin, unke sookshm objarveshan kii ore bhi ingit karata he
 Shastri can be called the psyche son of Nirala
 niraala kii swarna jayanti par abhinandan granth kii yojana thi
 If he could not get ready, Shastri himself decided to take out a thousand-page book
 haalanki vah yojana sambhavat: puri na ho pai
 But Satya Shastri of Nirala's life has said in a few words: "nirala revolted from the past, sought to build a new present of his interest, melted the talent in the furnace of ability, molded into new molds; But what was the result? a few roses of composition blossomed and life was filled with thorns
 mana kala chhichhli na rahi, par jivan ke pravaah main to bhavar ban gaye
 "according to the great personality of Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, the article on him is also the longest
 un par aisa 'lalit sansmaran’ aaj tak doosraa nahin likhaa gaya
 Despite such amazing talent and unmatched style, why did Shastri remain untouched on the map of literary history? All the big critics-writers-critics probably have no answer
 gopeshwar ji, hansbalaka ke pashchaat shastri ji kii anya kritiyaan kab tak aa rahi hai
 Shastri ji may not be there, but perhaps now the time has come for him to get his attainment

 In the midst of the ongoing debate over the introduction of the semester system in Delhi University, many teachers have called it a policy implemented in a threatening manner by the university administration, calling it a hasty step
 vishvavidhyalay prabandhan jahaan semester pranali ke tahat naye paathyakram ko shuru karne ke liye puri taiyaari chukaa he vahinshikshakonke ek varg kaa maananaa he ki is badlaav ke liye baahar se dabaav banaaya ja rahaa he or ise jabaran un par thopa ja rahaa he
 Teachers protesting under a Joint Action Buddy (JAB) termed their protest as an academic resistance movement
 unka kahana he ki shiksha kii 89 saal puraani vyavastha ko badalane ke liye jaldibaji ke bajaay uchit vichaar-vimarsh or charchaa kii jaani chahie
 Professor Rajesh Kumar, president of the staff union of Ramlal Anand College and a member of the Democratic Teachers Front, said, "the views of teachers have not been heard yet
 hamase koi pratikriya kyon nahin lee gayi jabaki nayi pranali main darasal padhaanaa hamen hi he
 a universal policy cannot be adopted for all courses
 ’jeebi kii sadsy professor vineeta chandra ne kaha ki shikshak dare hue hai or unhone nayi pranali kii khaamiyon ko hataane kii maang kii he
 Vinita, who teaches English at Ramjas College, said, 'the university is adopting a bullying policy
 ham dare hue hai
 i know that we must have been pulled in some way
 hamen yah bhi nahin pataa ki kya hoga
 We are helpless but still hope remains
 ’shikshakonne virodh pradarshan ke naye tareeke izaad kiye hai or ve kulapati karyaalay ke baahar lon main bacchon ko padhaa rahe hai tathaa candal lite visil yojit kar rahe hai
 They say that they are not against the semester system but they are opposed to the way it is being implemented without proper framework
 shikshakon ne aarope lagaaya ki saamaajik vigyaan vibhaag ko haal hi main ‘dhamkee bharaa’ patr mila jisamen unase is vyavastha ke khilaaf matdaan karne waalon kii suchi maangi gayi he
 Professor Hari Sen of the history department said that the language used in the letter also angered the teacher community
 dinadayal upaadhyaay college main angreji ke adhyaaapak professor pramesh ratnakar ne kaha, ‘yadi prashasan semester pranali ko badalane kaa itnaa hi icchhuk he to ise tark aadhaar par kiya janaa chahie jisamen vishay ke saath nyaay ho or hamaare padhaane ke tareeke par bhi aghat nahin ho jisamen na keval vishay balki chaatro kaa sampurna vikaas bhi shaamil he
 However, the chancellor of the university, Dinesh Singh, hopes to create a good atmosphere about this, regardless of the objections of the Shikshak community
 unhone kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki 2011 tak vishvavidhyalay main semester pranali shuru ho jaaegi
 Good atmosphere will be created
 yah lagbhag ho chukaa he
 We have made considerable progress
 ’kulapati ne kaha, ‘kuch samooh hai jo vishvavidhyalay ko pareshaani main daalana chaahate hai
 They are small in number and do not represent the entire teacher community
 ’ unhone semester pranali ko mahatvapurn bataate hue kaha ki yah vyavastha lacheelee he or duniya kii anya pranaaliyon se jodatii he

 karnataka main bijepi ke sabase bade chehre bies yediurppa kaa jaadu sir chadhakar bol rahaa he or isi ke boote bijepi bahumat ke kareeb pahunch gai he
 In South India, BJP is seen coming to power for the second time and this success is tied to Yeddyurappa, who won the 2008 election through 'operation Lotus', in that election BJP won 110 seats and formed the government
 
 chaaval mil ke clerk or ek kisaan netaa se aage badhkar yediurppa dakshin main pehali baar karnataka main bijepi kii sarkaar ke rup main camel khilaane vaale nayak bane the
 And now in 2018, he has almost once again ensured bjp's return to power
 maaloom ho ki paanch saal pehle 2013 main vidhansabha chunaav hue to bijepi ke liye yahi yediurppa khalanaayak ban gaye the
 In the 2018 Karnataka Assembly elections, she contested the election by making Bijepediyurappa as the Chief Ministerial candidate
 unhone rajya main duusari baar camel khilaane ke liye jamkar mehnat kii
 Yeddyurappa contested from his old traditional Shikaripura assembly seat
 ye lingayat bahul seat maani jaati he
 Yeddyurappa himself comes from the Lingayat community
 congress ne unke khilaaf jibi maltesh ko utaara he
 At the same time JDS has placed bets on HT Baligar
 bies yediurppa 75 saal kii umr puri kar chuke hai
 He was born on 27 February 1943 at Buchanakere in Mandya district of the state to Siddalingappa and Putthayamma
 chaar saal kii umr main unhone apni maa ko kho diya tha
 Political safarayediyurappas come from the most influential Lingayat community in the state
 1972 main unhen shikaripura taluka jansangh kaa adhyaksh chunaa gaya or unhone raajnneeti main pravesh kiya
 He rose to prominence in 1977 with the holding of the post of Secretary of the Janata Party
 pehali baar bane mlaunake vaastavik raajnneetik kariyar kii shuruyaat 1983 main hui jab vah pehali baar vidhansabha pahunche or tab se ab tak 7 baar shikaripura se vidhayak nirvaachit ho chuke hai
 He is assuming the responsibility of the state president of the party for the third time
 pehali baar 7 din ke liye CM baneyediurppa kii badaulat bijepi ne 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jabardast jeet darj kii thi
 Always seen in a white safari suit, Yeddyurappa had been the chief minister for 7 days even before the coalition government collapsed with the Janata Dal (S) in November 2007
 oparation lotus abhiyaan se 2008 main camel khilaayediurppane karnataka main 'oparation lotus' abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 Through this campaign, BJP had talked about feeding lotus in the state
 iske liye bijepi kaaryakarta ghar-ghar jaakar logon ko bijepi kii nitiyon kii baat karte the
 Kamal was also introduced as a symbol of Hindutva
 bijepi 'oparation lotus' dam par hi 2008 main 224 sadasyeey vidhansabha main bijepi bahumat hasil karne main safal rahi thi, lekin khanan kshetra se jude prabhaavshaalee reddy bandhu janardan or karunaakar unke liye pareshaani kaa sabab bane rahe
 Crisis filled with crisis CM Yeddyurappa's tenure of three years and 62 days in Karnataka was full of crises
 bataate chalem ki khanan ghotaale main lokayukta kii report yediurppa ke gale kii fans bani or unhen bhrashtachar kii vajah se apni mukhyamantri pad kii kursi bhi ganvaani padi thi
 He was charged with land and illegal mining scam
 iske baad wo jail gaye or phir reeha hue
 He then rebelled with the BJP and formed his own party
 ek baar phir bijepi ne lagaaya daanvvidhansabha chunaav 2008 main bijepi ke saath-saath unhen bhi karaari haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 After this, he returned to BJP again in January 2013 after Modi became the prime ministerial candidate
 ek ke baad ek sankaton se ubarkar yediurppa ne khud ko party ke andar raajnneetik dhurandhar ke rup main sabit kiya he
 The 2018 election results testify to this
 centre sarkaar ne netaji subhash chandra bose se sambandhit 25 or filein saarvajanik kii
 Now the number of files made public was 250
 is baar saarvajanik kii gai adhiktar filein videsh mantralay se sambandhit hai
 This time also there was neither any ceremony to make the files public nor the minister participated in this program
 is baar bhi pradhanmantri karyaalay se sambandhit ek charchit file saarvajanik nahin kii gai jiske kuch panne fate hue hai, yani gaayab hai
 Last time, this file was blocked because of no dispute
 ab tak netaji se judi 250 filein saarvajanikcendre sarkaar ke tahkhaanon auranational arkivemein rakhi hajaaron filon main se 250 filein saarvajanik hone ke baavjood abtak to koi aisa tathy saamne nahin aayaa jisase ye pukhta saboot mili ki netaji agast 1945 ke baad bhi jinda the
 However, the big question is still why the people of Netaji's family were being spied on
 lekin adhiktar tathy netaji ke bare main likhi gai kitabon main pehle bhi aa chuke hai
 Those doing research on Netaji will get help
 Currently, the government still has 990 files related to various ministries
 iske alaavakholsa kamishnase sambandhit 271 filein, mukherjee ayog se sambandhit 759 filein or grih mantralay kii 1030 filein neshnal arkive main maujuud hai
 These are gradually being digitized by treatment, so that they can be made public in time
 philhal to in filon ke saarvajanik karne kaa phayda netaji ke bare main research karne waalon ko to milegaa hi
 Despite the constant efforts of the government and the local administration, there is no reduction in the level of pollution in delhi-ncr and in the midst of this, the removal of the ban on the Supreme Court of Kakatpaw with some conditions is a very important decision that will decide that Delhi's air after the Diwali this year
 How will it be
 supreme courtne kuch sharton ke saath pataakhon kii bikri par bain hataaya he
 The court has said eco-friendly firecrackers, but how will it be identified? Are the firecrackers currently being sold in the markets are eco-friendly and if not, what will happen to them? Can people be confined to burning firecrackers within the stipulated time frame? There are many questions that will have to be answered by the administration and investigation agencies now
 koun karegaa pataakhon kii jaanchadrasal, supreme court ne deshbhar main pataakhon par se yah kehete hue bain hataa diya ki pataakhon ke nirmaataaon or vikritaon ke apni aajeevika chalaane ke sanvaidhanik adhikaar ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa lekin desh kii janata ke hit or sehat ko bhi dhyaan main rakhte hue kuch sharton ke saath yah bain hataaya ja rahaa he
 The court has allowed the burning of flame emission firecrackers at Sima (8 pm-10pm)
 iske alaava PESCO (petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation) ko ye jimmedaari di gai he ki ve bazaaron main main pahunchane vaale pataakhon ke polyushan emishan level ko check kare or pehle se bazaaron main maujuud pataakhon kii bhi jaanch kii jaae
 Suspicion in the market: There is happiness in the market after this decision of the report, but there is still a lot of confusion
 dukandaar dhadlle se puraane maal bina polyushan level check karaae pataakhe bech rahe hai or kharidaaron ko bhi isse philhal koi fark padataa nahin dikh rahaa
 After the verdict, the market is in awe
 sadar bazaar, filmistan bazaar, chandani chowk or duusare bazaar main pataakhe bikna shuru ho gaye he
 People are glad that firecrackers got permission
 ab khub jor lagaake pataakhe jalaayenge, to vahiin kuch kaa maananaa he pataakhon par bain jaruri tha
 During the mixed reaction of the people of Sadar Bazar, we reviewed Sadar Bazar and found that only one firecracker shop is open in the entire Sadar Bazar, the rest were not licensed
 ek dukandaar kaa kahana tha ki wo court ke faisle se khush hai or is baar use acchhee dukandaaree kii ummid he
 When he did not know much about flame emission crackers, he also agreed to investigate the firecrackers he is selling
 lekin agar jamini hakeekat dekhen to bik chuke pataakhon ko jalane se rokna prashasan ke saamne sabase badi chunauti hogi
 After the opinion of the people, it is easy for PESCO to check the crackers which have not reached the markets yet but it will be impossible to curb the firecrackers which are being sold indiscriminately in the markets these days
 malviya nagar ke ardblue pramukh rajeev raav ke anusaar logon ko pataakhon ko jalaane se rokna mumkin nahin
 Malviya Nagar RWA has started the tradition of Green Diwali in which the society people together perform the song together in the shade of the stars in the park and also make different dishes from their homes
 Huh
 inkaa maananaa he ye pataakhon ke shor or dhune se kahin behatar he

 Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, who was awarded the Bharat Ratna, has rarely said anything different from cricket during his career
 sachin jab bhi bole, hameshaa cricket kii baat
 Sachin was once seen reacting when Greg Chappell tried to change his batting order during the 2007 World Cup
 beete kuch dinon se sachin kii aatmakatha'plaing it maay ve' apane khulaason ke kaaran charchaa menhai
 In his book, Sachin described the then coach Greg Chappell as trying to break up the team
 2007 main jab sachin ne salaami jodi ke rup main utarane kii vajah bataane kii koshish kii to kuch logon ne unke paksh ko swaarth ke rup main dekha
 Sachin felt that his commitment to the Indian team was being questioned
 us samay world cap main bhartiya team duusare charan main bhi pravesh nahin kar pai thi
 After his return from the World Cup, the feud between Sachin and Chappell came to the fore and Sachin took the matter to the BCCI
 khulkar saamne aane lagi kahaniaisa kai baar dekha gaya he ki bisisiai ne apane senior khilaadiyon kaa paksh lete hue kochon ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya he
 Many times, senior players have played a role in showing the way out to many fellow players in view of the bad impact on the team
 chapel ne kuch saal pehle ek intervyuu main sachin ko nichle kram par ballebaaji karne ke liye vivash karne ke apane nirnay par pachhtaawaa vyakt kiya tha
 In such a situation, Sachin's statement should be seen in the order of history as to what exactly happened in that World Cup
 chapel ne kuch takneekee aankadon ke aadhaar par sachin ko rahul dravid kii jagah captain pad sanbhaalane kaa suzav diya tha
 However, Chappell says that he visited Sachin's house about 12 months before the World Cup 2007
 tendulkar ne jis andaaj main chapel kaa bayaan likhaa he, vah kuch-kuch mumbai ke do sarganaon ke bich apane-apane adhikaar kshetra ko lekar ho rahi baton kii tarah he
 In Tendulkar's autobiography 'playing It My Way', Sachin quoted Chappell as saying, 'help me take control of the team with Rahul Dravid
 taaki ham bhartiya cricket par varshon tak niyantran kar saken
 "was Dravid really close to Chappell? Tendulkar has been fiercely angry in his book on the Australian chapel, who was the coach of the Indian cricket team from 2005 to 2007
 tendulkar ne likhaa he, 'chapel kisi ringamaster kii tarah the, jo khilaadiyon par apane vichaar thopate the
 Whether it is convenient for the player or not
 ' purv captain saurabh ganguli tab chapel ke khilaaf bolne waalon main akele the or unhen iske evaj main apni captaini ganvaani padi thi
 Ganguly had then made a sensational disclosure, saying that Chappell had Dravid in his favor and removed him from the captaincy
 lekin yahaan ek vivadajanak sthiti paidaa hoti he ki agar dravid, chapel se itane najadik the to unhen hataakar tendulkar ko captain kaise banaaya ja saktaa tha
 However, Dravid has kept himself completely separate from this whole affair
 unhone kaha, 'vah do vyaktiyon ke bich hui nijee baatcheet main bolne ke adhikari nahin hai
 'harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan had come forward in favor of Sachin and both had accused Chappell of causing differences and insecurity among the players
 vastav main chapel bilkul nae vichaaron ke saath bharat aae the or unhen nahin pataa tha ki vah saanp ke bill main haath daalane ja rahe hai or unke bilkul nae vichaaron ko yahaan koi maanane vaala nahin he
 It was Chappell who first started saying that Mahendra Singh Dhoni or Dinesh Karthik have the potential to become captains, which can reduce pressure from senior players
 yah bhi sabhi jaanate hai ki chapel ne vivies lakshmana se pari kii shuruyaat karwaane kii koshish kii or kaha tha ki lakshmana kaa test cricket ant kii ore he
 However, Sachin's contribution as a player cannot be questioned
 unhen bhagwaan maanane vaale unke likhe ko sar ankhon par rakhenge hi or nishchit taur par prakaashak jab aise mahaan khilaadi kii aatmakatha lekar aate hai to unka makasad kuch aisi chijen lekar aana hota he, jo lekhak ke samarthakon ko pustak kharidne par vivash kar de

 In order to ensure that nothing goes wrong, we have devised a strategy for counting day
 ’chhattisgarh congress ke netaa party ke booth agenton ko bhi prashikshan dene ke liye puraa samay de rahe hai

 ’rajya party netritv ne ye hidaayat bhi jari kii he ki jeetne vaale ummidavaar vijay juluus nikaalane kii jagah apane certificate ke saath tatkaal raipur ke liye ravaanaa hon
 Polling agents are also being explained that they have to be vigilant during the counting of votes
 saath hi unhen aisi fehrist bhi saunpi ja rahi he jisamen bataaya kya gaya he ki matganana ke din kya kya karnaa he or kya kya nahin karnaa he
 The Chhattisgarh Congress has also formed a number of smaller teams that will closely monitor the strong rooms where the used evms are housed
 puniya ne kaha, ‘in tiimon ko satark rahane ke liye kaha gaya he jisase ki bina istemaal kii gai evms ko istemaal ho chukin evms ke saath matganana vaale din milaane kii koi koshish naa ho sake
 We cannot take a chance
 ’chhattisgarh ke party netaaon se lagaataar milane vaale congress ke vayovruddh netaa motilal vora ne kaha, evms par gahan najar rakhi jaaegi
 We need to be very cautious on the day of counting
 ummidavaaron or agenton se kaha gaya he ki unhen kahin kuch sandigdh lage to use tatkaal chunaav cameti ke adhikariyon ke sangyaan main laaen
 So that later they could not say that this matter did not come to our notice
 ’congress voton ke tebulation ko lekar bhi bahut satark he
 Punia said, tabulation of votes on behalf of agents should be carefully prepared
 ye bhi sunishchit kiya janaa chahie ki ek round ke voton kaa tebulation puraa ho jane ke baad hi agle round ke liye tebulation shuru hona chahie
 Congress MP t Sahu said, we should be very cautious in view of the way BJP misuses government machinery

 Alagiri has been accused of going against the party's stance and expressing a different view on the subject of alliances with Vijayakanth-led MDMK

 narendra modi kaa america daura kai myne main aitihaasik rahaa
 Before leaving for India, US Secretary of State John Carrey put Modi on par with Mahatma Gandhi
 darasal narendra modi ne kaha tha ki jaise gandhi ne aazaadee kii ladaai ko jan andolan bana diya, vaise hi ham vikaas ko jan andolan bana den
 In every speech, whether Modi is in India or outside, he remembers the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi
 chaahe dilli main rajghat ho, gujarat kaa sabarbati ashram yaa phir washington main gandhi pratimaa
 Whenever Modi gets a chance, he remembers Bapu
 lekin, modi ne sochaa bhi nahin hoga ki jab ve america se laut rahe honge, to duniya kaa sabase taqatvar mulk unki tulana gandhi se kar rahaa hoga
 On the last day of his five-day US visit, US Secretary of State John Carrie put him on par with Gandhi at a luncheon hosted by Vice President Joe Biden in Modi's honor
 kairi ne kaha, 'ham chaahate hai ki bharat ke vikaas main pradhanmantri modi ke yogadan or bharat kii aazaadee main mahatma gandhi ke yogadan ko ek tarah se yaad kiya jaae
 'this is not the first time Carrie has openly praised Modi
 isse pehle july main jab ve bharat aae the, to unhone modi ke naare 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' kii tarif kii thi, jabaki yahaan 'chaiwale' se piem tak ke unke safar kii dil kholkar saraahna kii
 Praising development programs is one thing and it is a different thing to make Modi equal to Gandhi
 modi ko hindustan kii kaman sanbhale mahaj chaar maheene beete hai or unhen abhi desh kii arthvyavastha ko patari par laana he
 But even before that America gave such a big honor to Modi, who was shying away from granting a visa till he became PM
 sawaal uthta he ki aise main america kaa itnaa bada hriday parivartan kaise ho gaya? chaahe jo ho, paanch dinon ke america daure main modi ke liye yah badi jeet kahi jaaegi
