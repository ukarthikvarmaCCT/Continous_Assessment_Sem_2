 ) After becoming Congress General Secretary, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has landed in the Uttar Pradesh ground riding on an election chariot
 rajya main post padi congress main phir utsaah bharna priyanka ke saamne badi chunauti he
 If the Congress fights alone in Uttar Pradesh, it has to fight on two fronts simultaneously
 jisamen ek ore piem modi kii aguwai main bijepi he to duusari ore akhilesh yadav or mayawati kaa gathbandhan he
 People are comparing Priyanka to the former Prime Minister and her grandmother Indira, but Priyanka faces a bigger challenge than Indira
 jab indira gandhi raajnneeti main ai thim to unke saath congress ke kaaryakarta, nehru or laal bahadur shastri kii viraasat or aam janamanas main ke dil main basii congress thi
 The opposition was completely absent
 lekin priyanka ke saath to is samay koi bada mudda he or 'garibi hataao' jaisaa karishmai naaraa sawaal yaheen se uthaa ki kya priyanka, indira or pita rajeev kii viraasat tham centre kii raajnneeti karenge
 But Congress President Rahul Gandhi has given the answer to this question
 lakhanu main road sho ke dauraan rahul gandhi ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav lakshya jarur he lekin priyanka ab uttar pradesh main congress kii sarkaar banavaayengi
 Meaning Priyanka Gandhi will now be the face of Congress in Uttar Pradesh
 darasal congress ke alaakaman ne faisla kiya he ki 80 loksabhaa siton vaale uttar pradesh ko saadhe bina dilli paanaa aasaan nahin he
 In Uttar Pradesh, it is better to contest the elections with the help of regional parties and raised the Congress itself
 iske liye ek bade chehre kii jarurat thi jisaki bharpai ab priyanka gandhi karengi
 Anyway, SP and BSP have not included Congress in their alliance
 shuru main congress ke netaa kuch netaa in donon se gathbandhan main guhaar lagaate dikhe lekin baad main congress ne aakraamak ranneeti apanaate hue puri 80 siton par ladane kaa elaan kar diya
 It can be beneficial that the Congress will strengthen its cadre and help in establishing its position in the state
 priyanka kii team kii ranneeti ke mutabik uttar pradesh main un siton par zyada focus karnaa he jisamen 20 fisadi yaa usase zyada dalit voter hai
 During Indira's votebank of Dalit voter congress, who now consider BSP supremo Mayawati as their leader
 is samay uttar pradesh main 80 aisi siten hai jisamen 20 fisadi yaa usase zyada dalit hai vahiin 17 siten arakshit hai
 At the same time, Priyanka's face can also attract upper caste votes, it was also with Congress at the time of Indira
 matlab he uttar pradesh main congress ab priyanka ke sahare apni jadon ko lautne kii koshish kar rahi he iske liye ab priyanka gandhi wadra vidhansabha chunaav main mukhyamantri pad kii daavedaar bhi ho jaaen to koi badi baat nahin hogi

 While the Modi government (modi Govt) would like to pass this bill in the Rajya Sabha, by stopping it from passing the bill, many parties, including the Congress, will also be tempted to show a glimpse of opposition unity
 rajyasabha main yah bill paas nahin ho sake, iske liye vipaksh ekajute ho rahaa he or ise select cameti ke paas bhejne kii maang kar rahaa he
 The Congress as well as the notes of the Samajwadi Party are also on the triple talaq bill
 donon partiyon kaa kahana he ki bill ko rajyasabha main paarit karaane se pehle bill ko jwanit select cameti ke paas bheja janaa chahie
 Let me tell you that whenever a political consensus has to be formed on an issue, it is sent to the Joint Select Committee
 rajyasabha main bijepi sabase badi party ho chuki he, lekin bahumat main nahin he
 Parties against the bill are seen to be more powerful and mobilized, apart from this, many mps are not with the government
 yani sarkaar ke paas yahaan bahumat nahin he
 While the opposition is adamant on amending the bill
 congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne enditivi se kaha ki tripal talaak bill main sajaa kaa praavdhaan nahin hona chahie
 Making civil law a criminal law
 jab samudaay ko sweekaar nahin he to bill un par kyon thopa ja rahaa he

 vahiin, is masale par samaajawaadee party bhi congress ke sur main sul mila rahi he
 Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav said that we want the provision of three years' sentence to be removed from the triple divorce bill
 teen talaak bill ko select cameti ko bhej dena chahie, taaki kamiyon ko dur kiya ja sake
 On behalf of BJP, Vijay Goel told NDTV that there is no need to send the triple talaq bill to the Joint Select Committee
 ham rajyasabha main sabhi raajnneetik partiyon se apil karte hai ki wo bill kaa samarthan karen
 At the same time, BJD leader Prasanna Patasani says that this is a sensitive bill
 is par sabhi raajnneetik partiyon main aam sahmati banaakar hi sarkaar ko aage badhanaa chahie
 Not only this, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), opposing the provision of declaring triple talaq (divorce-e-biddat) as a crime, said that it will not support the Muslim Women's Rights Protection Bill related to it in the upper house
 
 rajyasabha main aap ke netaa sanjay singh ne shuukravaar ko bataaya ki muslim mahilaon ko teen talaak kii kupratha se nijaat dilaane ke naam par muslim samaaj ke logon ko daraane ke liye laae gaye is vidheyak kaa party virodh karegi
 The first indication from the opposition that he would not allow the bill to be passed in the Rajya Sabha
 bataa den ki yah vidheyak guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main paarit ho gaya or ab ise ucch sadan main laayaa jaayegaa
 It is also not easy for the Modi government to pass this bill in Rajya Sabha because BJP does not have majority in Rajya Sabha
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki yah vidheyak agle saptaah ucch sadan main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Praising opener Shikhar Dhawan's match-winning century against South Africa, Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said the left-handed batsman showed sensible play by spending time at the crease even after completing his century
 dhawan ne jis tarah se apni pari ke dauraan ranneeti banaai usase dhoni khush hai
 With Dhawan's 137-run innings, India were able to score 307 runs
 dhoni ne bharat kii 130 ran kii jeet ke baad kaha, aaj vah usee tarah se ballebaaji kar rahaa tha, jis tarah karata he
 When he needed to play big shots, he played and he was also rotating strikes
 usne sunishchit kiya ki shatak puraa karne ke baad bhi vah krij par rahe
 Dhoni said, it is important that if you score a century, then you can score 130 or 140 runs, you should always help the team to score 20 to 25 extra runs
 isliye yah uski ore se acha rahaa ki usne sunishchit kiya ki vah ant tak tikaa rahe, kyonki aam taur par salaami ballebaaj 25 over ke baad bade shot khilne kii koshish karte hai
 He feels that his work is done
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki is halaat main lay main aane ke baad aapako iskaa puraa phayda uthaanaa chahie
 Captain Dhoni is also happy to get into the rhythm of the team with two consecutive wins
 loksabhaa chunaav main munh kii khaane ke baad gathbandhan kaa bhavishya adhar main jaataa dikh rahaa he
 On Monday, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati held a review meeting in Delhi and what she said here are indicative that she is not good for the alliance
 mayawati ne kaha ki gathbandhan hone ke baad jaise nateezon kii ummid thi vah nahin mil paae hai
 Mayawati has bluntly said that she will now contest elections on her own
 mayawati kii ore se kaha gaya he ki aage kii ranneeti par kaam karne se pehle vah gathbandhan kii samiksha karengi
 After this stance of Mayawati, questions have been raised in the political circles whether the alliance of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party will survive till the Assembly elections in 2022
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle or prachaar ke dauraan sapa-basapa donon hi 50 se adhik loksabhaa siten jeetne kaa daawa kar rahe the
 But the results proved to be completely reversed, with the alliance narrowing to just 15 seats
 haalanki, jo basapa 2014 main 0 siton par simat gai thi ab vah das siton tak pahunch gai he
 Why did the coalition fail? Before the election, there was a claim that the caste-based maths done by the SP-BSP would be harmful for the BJP
 lekin chunaav nateezon main saaf hua ki basapa kaa vot pratishat jas kaa tas rahaa to vahiin samaajawaadee party kaa vot pratishat bhi gir gaya
 It was clear from the results that the caste math formula that was applied did not fit and the Bharatiya Janata Party got a vote away from the casteist
 yahi kaaran rahaa he ki bijepi akele dam par puure upi main 50 fisadi ke kareeb vot or 64 siton par jeet darj kar pai to vahiin sapa-basapa milakar 15 siten or 40 fisadi ke aasapaas vot share par hi simat gaye
 Will the assembly be together till the elections? Now everyone's eye is on whether this alliance will last till 2022
 kyonki chunaav se pehle akhilesh ne kaha tha ki vah mayawati ko pradhanmantri banane ke liye mehnat kar rahe hai or mayawati bhi mujhe mukhyamantri banane ke liye taiyaar hai
 But Mayawati's dream could not be fulfilled, now it has to be seen whether Akhilesh's talk can last till
 kyonki is baithak main mayawati ne do took kaha ki shivpal yadav kii vajah se yadav vot bank basapa ko nahin mil paaya he
 He has even said that the BSP will now try its hand in the assembly by-elections which are rarely seen
 agar basapa vidhansabha upachunaav main akele utarati he to 2022 kaa chunaav bhi vah akele dam par lard sakati he or ek baar phir sapa-basapa aamane-saamne aa sakate hai

 apane sandesh main piem modi ne kaha ki bhartiya granthon main hajaaron saal pehle likhe vasudev kutanbakam ke siddhant ko aaj puri duniya ko jarurat he
 In order to bring the benefit of global economic development to the whole society, it is necessary that all the countries of the world should follow each other like a family on this principle
 jaane pradhanmantri ke spich kii 15 khaas baaten:1
 The Prime Minister said that India started in Davos in 1997 when the then Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda reached Davos
 tab se lekar ab tak bharat kii jidipi 6 guna ho chuki he
 At that time the slogan of this platform was Building the Network Society
 aaj ham sirf network socity hi nahin balki big data, artificial intelligence ke yug main ji rahe hai
 2
 aaj do dashakon ke baad hamaara samaaj ek jatil network se bandhaa he, us vakt bhi daavos apane samay se aage tha or aaj bhi vah aage he
 This year, Creating a Shared World is its theme
 3
 At present, large mountains of data are ready and efforts are being made to control them
 mana ja rahaa he ki jiske paas data kaa adhikaar hoga vahiin duniya ke sheersh par kabiz hoga
 4
 vigyaan, takniki or aarthik tarakkee ke nae ayaamon main samaaj ko aage badhaane kaa dam he lekin isse maanavtaa ko baantne kaa kaam bhi kiya he
 This has also disturbed the balance of peace and prosperity
 5
 The world is grappling with the problem of poverty, unemployment and control of natural resources
 hamen sochna he ki kya hamaari arthvyavastha samaaj main daraaron ko tarjeeh to nahin de rahi he

 7
 PM Modi said that there is a big challenge of climate change in front of the world and we are not able to make united efforts to fight it
 piem modi ne kaha ki jab duniya ke saamne koi saajha chunauti aae to sabhi ko ekajute hokar unka saamana karne kii jarurat he
 8

 Thousands of years ago, in India, we are all children of the earth, mother sons, important sons
 yadi aisa he to aaj ham prithvi kii santanon main yuddh kyon chal rahaa he?9
 PM Modi said that the second biggest challenge facing India is terrorism
 aatankwaad se duniya kii sabhi sarkarein parichit hai
 On its two dimensions, PM Modi said that the distinction between Good Terrorist and Bad Terrorist is more dangerous than terrorism
 10
 Prime Minister Modi said that among the challenges of terrorism, the most serious issue facing the world is that educated people all over the world are choosing the path of terrorism
 is chunauti se nipatane ke liye behad jaruri he ki duniyabar ke deshon ko ekajute hokar aarthik nitiyon ke sahare sabhi virgon ko mukhyadhara main laaen

 The United Nations is still valid, but do the organizations formed after the Second World War reflect today's human aspirations? Changes in the flow of globalization
 dupaksheeya or bahupaksheeya vyapaar samjhaute ruk chuke hai
 12
 bharat main riform, parform or transform kii nitiyon par chalane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 As a result, investing in India, doing business, going for tourism etc
 has become much easier than before
 13
 PM Modi said that red carpet is being laid in India by removing red tape
 zyaadaatar kshetron main automatic root ke jariye videshi nivesh ko manjuuri de di gai he
 Within the last three years in India, hundreds of old and useless laws have been removed
 desh main pardarshita ko badhaane ke liye desh main jiesti ko bhi lagu kiya gaya he
 14
 bharat ke log or bharat ke yuva 5 trillian dollar kii arthvyavastha ke nirmaan main sakriy hai
 Through innovation, he will become a job giver and not a job seeker
 piem modi ne kaha ki bharat kii ranking or reating main hue sudhaar se duniya parichit he
 The country has voluntarily renounced subsidies

 Also, competition between them should not stand as a wall

 The PM said that reforms in international organizations should be done immediately

 The brutal mass murder of 282 unarmed 'indigenous' soldiers on 1 August 1857 in Ajnala, Punjab, was a brutal incident to crush the first voice that arose for independence, executed by the merciless order of then-deputy Commissioner of Amritsar Frederick Henry Cooper

 What was revealed in the excavation was beyond imagination

 Despite all the paper evidence collected by Kochhar, no officer was ready to support him
 unke mutabik kaabil visheshgyon ne bhi chuppi saadh rakhi thi
 Says Kochhar, "the biggest problem was that no such wells were visible in the place mentioned in Cooper's book or other documents
 ”kochar kaa maananaa tha ki sainikon ko jis jagah dafnaaya gaya tha, vah gurudwara shahidganj ke neeche rahaa hoga
 This gurudwara was built around 1947
 lekin ek ashanka se unki jaan nikal rahi thi ki kahin gurudwara shaheedon kii kabr par na khadaa ho
 In December 2012, the Gurudwara management led by Amarjit Singh Sarkaria approved the excavation under the supervision of a historian
 kochar ne yaad karte hue bataaya, ''abhi 10 foot bhi khudaai nahin hui thi ki hamen pracheen nanakshahi eenton se bani kuen kii ghumaavdaar diwaar dikhi

 Looking at the seven more skeletons surrounding that skeleton, Kochhar said, "this person must have been alive at that time and must have been trying to get out of the pile of corpses
" ”do dinon tak khudaai main nikle kankalon ke dher bataa rahe the ki vah kitni nrushans ghatana thi
 The tears of Ajnala's people were not stopping seeing them

 - Why is this election being conducted from the Generation 1 evms or those pre-2006 evms that were sold to the flea because their security features were very weak

 For this the first 2,600 places were selected, after which only 17 countries were selected as semi-finals
 aakhirkaar ab company ne paanch deshon ko final kiya he
 What is Hyperloop? There may be a big change in the way and time of train travel
 ye sambhav hoga hyperloop takanic se
 Hyperloop is a medium that can be covered in long distances in minutes
 america company testla or spes eks ne milakar ise shuru kiya he
 Hyperloop consists of a series of sealed tubes through which people can travel from one place to another without any friction and wind blockage
 isamen train jaise hi logon ke liye jagah hogi
 Hyperloop One had long held a contest in which places around the world were to be selected for hyperloop
 ab company ne 10 jagahon ko chunaa he jahaan duniya ke pehle hyperloop trek banaae ja sakate hai
 These 10 places of five countries also include India

 kyonki is propojal ko asaliyat main laane ke liye kaaphi kuch kiya janaa baaki he
 Currently, Hyperloop is a concept, but it is being tested
 You can get a sense of the speed of Hyperloop by the fact that it can be faster than airplanes and bullet trains
 agar concept asal jindagi main aayaa to pancenger tub main pod ke sahare yatra kar sakate hai
 In this pod, magnetic levitation and low friction will be used, which will make its movement quite fast

 Let us tell you that Chennai to Bangalore is 334 kilometers
 mumbai se channai kii duuri 1102 kilometre he or hyperloop project se yah sirf 63 minute main tay kii ja sakegi
 The concept was first introduced by Tesla's founder Elon Musk in 2012 and has been under development ever since
 testla ke adhikari ise bharat main laana chaahate hai auraunhone demonstrishan ke jariye bataaya heki dilli se mumbai kii duuri paisangers ghante bhar main kar sakate hai
 It would be faster than airplane travel and slightly cheaper than that
 haalanki sarkaar ne abhi iske liye ijaajat nahin di he
 During testing, its speed was 309 kmph, but there are plans to speed it up
 For a year, the company did a low speed test of hyperloop, but ultimately it has been tested at a speed
 29 july ko hiparloop van ke prototip pod ko 500 meter lambey test tub main choda gaya tha
 The Hyper Loop One caught a speed of about 309 kmph during testing
 company kaa daawa he ki yah ab tak kaa sabase tej hiparloop test he
