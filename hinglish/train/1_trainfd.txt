 News of the affair between Madhuri Dixit and Sanjay Dutt, who were seen together in superhit films like 'khalnayak' and 'saajan', was very hot in the 90s
 yun to yah kissa usee samay khatm ho gaya or ab maadhuri dikshit or sanjay dutt donon hi apni shaadishuda jindagi main aage bad rahe hai
 But once again, talks are being made on this alleged affair of years old and the reason for this is the biopic on Sanjay Dutt
 aise main khabaren hai ki is boyapik ko bana rahe diarector rajkumaar hiraani ne maadhuri dikshit se casting ke samay baat kii thi
 According to media reports, Madhuri Dixit has spoken about not showing about this years-old affair in this biopic
 haalanki yah saaf nahin he ki film main sanjay dutt kii jindagi ke is pahalu par baat hogi yaa nahin
 The comments haal hi main mid de se baat karte hue maadhuri dikshit ne kaha, 'in baton kaa ab koi matlab nahin rah jaataa he
 It is useless to discuss them (sanjay Dutt)
 ' unase jab sanjay dutt kii boyapik main aane kii baat poochi gai to unhone kaha, 'mujhe nahin pataa aisi afvaahen kahaan se ud rahi hai
 In any case, i do not mind such things now
 ' bataa den ki rajkumaar hiraani isse pehle sanjay dutt ke saath 'munna bhai embibies' or 'lage raho munna bhai' bana chuke hai
 In this biopic of Sanjay Dutt, Ranbir Kapoor will be seen as Sanjay Dutt
 kaha jaataa he ki unka rishta 1993 main sanjay dutt kii giraftaar ke baad khatm ho gaya
 Madhuri Dixit did not even go to jail to meet him

 peedita ne ajtak se baat karte hue apni aapbeetee sunai
 During this time his mother was also present with him
 police ne maamla darj kar liya he
 The negligence of the police has also come to light in this whole case

 But the police was not registering her complaint

 aakhirkaar, ladki ne aurangabad police ke watsape group par apni shikaayat post kii, tab jaakar police ne ladki ke sathbalaatkaar, utpeedan, dhamkaae jane or pitayee karne kaa maamla darj kiya
 The victim girl told Aaj Tak that in February this year, she was identified with Deputy Commissioner Rahul Shriram at the Garwara Stadium in the city
 ladki ke mutabik upayukta rahul shrirame ne khud usase baat karnaa shuru kiya
 When the victim girl was preparing for MPSC, the Deputy Commissioner assured the girl to give guidance in studies
 ek maheene ke watsape chating ke baad ek din ladki ko books dene ke bahaane usne flats main bulaayaa
 And then there he made a physical relationship with her by pretending to marry her
 is dauraan aaropee adhikari ne use naukari dilaane kaa aashwaasan bhi diya tha
 The girl alleged that from February to May, Deputy Commissioner Rahul Sriramay continued to have sexual relations with her and later tried to get rid of the girl by saying that she was married
 ek baar upayukta rahul shrirame ne peedit ladki ko baatcheet ke liye ghar par bulaayaa or baad main ladki ke saath badasluki kii

 Pakistan's former military dictator Pervez Musharraf has challenged the decision to dismiss his application in the Islamabad High Court, in which he had pleaded to send a case of treason against him to the military court

 The special court rejected Musharraf's application, saying that he had every right to prosecute him

 yadi pratyaashee apni jamaanat bachaa lete hai to yah bhi unke liye garv kii baat hoti he, jabaki jamaanat ke jabt hone ko aksar apmanjanak samajha jaataa he
 According to Election Commission rules, if the candidate fails to get at least one-sixth of the total valid votes polled, then his or her bail amount gets deposited in the government treasury, but if we look at the data of previous general elections In the recent elections, voters in the electoral arena forfeited the bail of nearly 90 percent of the candidates
 1951-52 ke pehle loksabhaa chunaav main lagbhag 40 pratishat yani 1874 ummidavaaron main se 745 pratyaashiyon kii jamaanat jabt ho gai
 Since then the number of seizures of bail has increased in almost all Lok Sabha elections
 jamaanat jabt hone waalon kii sankhya 1996 main hue 11veen loksabhaa ke chunaavon main sabase adhik rahi
 At that time, out of 13952 candidates, 12688 candidates ie 91 percent of the candidates lost their deposits
 is chunaav main loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladane vaale ummidavaaron kii sankhya bhi sabase adhik thi
 In this context, the last Lok Sabha election in 2009 was also not good for the candidates
 isamen bhi 85 pratishat pratyaashiyon kii jamaantein jabt ho gayi
 This was the third largest number of bail seizures in percentage terms in terms of bail forfeiture in the 1996 elections and 91 percent in the 1991 elections
 1951-52 main hue pehle chunaavon main rashtriya dalon ke 1217 ummidavaaron main se 344 yani 28 pratishat pratyaashiyon kii jamaantein jabt hui
 The situation improved in the next elections held in 1957
 is samay 919 pratyaashiyon main se keval 130 pratyaashiyon matlab 14 pratishat ummidavaaron kii jamaanat jabt hui
 The performance of national parties was the best in the 1977 general elections
 in chunaavon main 1060 pratyaashiyon main se keval 100 pratyaashee arthath 9 pratishat kii jamaanat jabt hui
 By comparison, the 2009 general election was not as good for candidates from national parties, as almost every other candidate lost his / her bail
 2009 main rashtriya dalon ke 1623 pratyaashiyon main se 779 ummidavaaron kii jamaanat jabt ho gai
 The position of candidates of national parties was the worst in the elections to the 11th Lok Sabha
 yahaan 1817 pratyaashiyon main se 897 yani 49 pratishat pratyaashiyon kii jamaantein jabt ho gayi
 Even though the bail is forfeited, the confiscation of the bail has not been an obstacle in contesting elections, as the number of contestants is generally increasing in every election

 On the second day of Agenda Aaj Tak, Congress leader Anand Sharma spoke
 sharma ne modi sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki notebandi ke naam par desh main tamaasha ho rahaa he
 He said that there was no preparation before demonetisation
 pradhanmantri halaat ko sanbhaalane ke liye kisi tarah kii koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 Only drama is happening
 congress netaa ne aarope lagaaya ki notembandi ke baad logon ko bheekh maangane par majaboor kiya gaya
 He said that black money must end
 lekin nakli note ke naam par notebandi galat he
 The government first announced demonetisation, then it was said to carry out cashless transactions
 2000 ke note se kaala dhan or badhegaa
 Small factories are closing in the country
 sharma ne aarope lagaaya ki modi sarkaar ne hindustan ko duniya main kalankit kar diya gaya ki hamaari iconomi hi kaale dhan par tiki he
 The daily wages of farmers and laborers run on cash
 yah kaala sa nahin he
 It is not a crime money
 apni aay ghoshit nahin karnaa hi kaala dhan he
 Ambassadors of other countries are getting upset in the country
 hamaari image kharaab ho rahi he
 The Congress leader said that the PM should have come to the House after the problems caused by demonetisation
 piem baahar bolte hai, sadan main nahin bolte hai
 No one has stopped the PM from speaking
 vipaksh charchaa se nahin bhaag rahaa he
 The opposition is being told not to criticize
 sarkaar ne sansad kaa apmaan kiya he
 What has the government done in two and a half years unhone kaha, 'meraa naam anand sharma kii jagah kisi alpsankhyak kaa naam hota to use deshadrohi qaraar diya jaataa
 If there is no voice of opposition in democracy, the balance will be disturbed
 notebandi par 16 partiyaan ekajute hai
 Anand Sharma stressed that there is democracy within the Congress party, this is not the case in the current Modi government
 piem modi ko unki sarkaar main kisi ke paas aisi himmat nahin he jo unhen suzav de
 Perhaps only Amit Shah can suggest PM Modi
 chhattisgarh vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle daur kii voting se chand din pehle satnami samaaj ke guru baldas ne apane bete khushvanth sahab ke saath congress kaa daaman tham liya he
 This is considered a setback for the BJP
 gauratlab he ki pichley vidhansabha chunaav main voting se ain pehle guru baldas ne satnam sena naam kii party kaa gathan kiya tha or das anusuchit jati varg ke liye arakshit siton par apane ummidavaar maidan main utaare the
 It is believed that the Congress suffered a lot in these seats
 trikoniya halaat ke bich bijepi kaa phayda mila tha
 BJP had won nine out of ten seats
 pradesh main satnami samaaj kaa ek bada vot bank he
 This society accounts for about 16 percent of the total votes
 yahi vajah he ki siyaasi partiyaan unhen apane saath jodne kii harsambhav koshish main rahati hai
 In June 2017, Guru Baldas met BJP National President Amit Shah who visited Chhattisgarh
 is mulaakaat ke baad kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki baldas kaa bijepi pravesh ho saktaa he
 Instead of standing with the BJP in the assembly elections this time, Satnami society is seen as a big political development
 satnami samaaj ke guru baldas ne kehete hai ki bijepi ne samaaj ke logon kaa sammaan nahin kiya, isliye unhone congress party join kii he
 After the entry of Guru Baldas into the Congress, the party is hoping to win in the Chhattisgarh Assembly election by winning the crucial election
 dilachasp baat yah he ki congress main pehle se hi satnami samaaj ke ek netaa rudra guru maujuud hai
 In the 2013 assembly elections in Chhattisgarh, BJP got ten seats more than the Congress
 lekin vot share main bijepi 0
 Only 77 percent was more than the Congress
 aise main satnami samaaj kaa congress ke samarthan main elaan se 15 saal ke satta ke vanvaas khatm hone kii ummid najar aa rahi he
 Actually, caste factor is also important in Chhattisgarh
 mayawati ke saath aane se jogi kii janata congress ko ummid he ki dalit matadaataaon ko vot ekamusth unhen milenge
 Especially called Satnami society from which Jogis come
 aise main congress ne satnami samaaj ko apane saath jodakar ajit jogi or basapa gathbandhan ko tagada jhatka diya he
 Satnami society has a big hold in Chhattisgarh as a vote bank
 pradesh kii 14 vidhaan sabha siton par 20 se 35 pratishat vot inke hai
 In the last election, out of 10 assembly seats reserved for Dalits, BJP won 9 seats and one seat went to Congress
 satnami samaaj kaa congress ke saath aane se chauthi baar bijepi ke satta main aane ke sapane par pani phir saktaa he
 Today is the birthday of Amit Mishra, who made a record in IPL
 bhartiya team ke liye vanade, test or tii20 main rhite arm leg brake ball phenkane vaale amit mishra kaa janm 24 november 1982 ko hua
 Amit Mishra was first included in Team India in 2002 but was then not included in the playing XI
 haalanki jaldi hi unhen team india ke liye vanade main khilne kaa mauka mila
 He made his ODI debut against South Africa in the TVS Cup (2003) and also took his first ODI wicket
 haalanki iske baad mishra ko test match khilne ke liye paanch saalon kaa intjaar karnaa padaa or 2008 main unhen team india ke niyamit gendbaaj anil kumble ke chotil hone kii vajah se mohali test khilne kaa mauka mila
 Mishra took advantage of this opportunity well and played a key role in the victory with a stunning 5 wickets in the first innings and a total of 7 wickets in the Test despite the presence of bowlers like Harbhajan and Zaheer in the Test
 iske baavjood tab team india ke coach gairi karston ne kaha ki kumble kii vaapasi ke saath hi mishra ko bench par baithna padegaa lekin tab mishra lucky rahe ki kumble kii vaapasi ke baad bhi wo team main bane rahe kyonki tab harbhajan chotil ho gaye
 Shortly after this, Kumble retired from the Test but Mishra could not become a regular leg-spinner in Team India and sometimes he was out in the team, sometimes due to the compulsion to feed a spinner in the team
 is dauraan team main jagah banaae rakhane ke liye mishra kaa muqabla turbanetor harbhajan or leg spinner pragyan ojha se rahaa
 In November 2009 against Sri Lanka, Mishra took only one wicket after spending 203 runs and in the next match he took a brilliant 7 wickets, this match he played against Bangladesh
 mishra ne apana aakhri test agast 2011 main englad ke khilaaf khelaa jisamen unhen 170 kharchane ke baavjood koi wicket nahin mila or phir unhen ab tak kisi test ke liye team main nahin chunaa gaya
 Mishra has played a total of 13 Test matches and 43 in his bag
 30 kii ausat se 43 wicket hai
 Performing in odis, Mishra has been included in the ODI team continuously
 2013 main IPL main joardaar pradarshan ke baad mishra ko vanade team main shaamil kiya gaya or unhone zimbabwe ke daure par shandaar pradarshan kiya
 On this tour, he set the record for most wickets in a bilateral series with 18 wickets in five matches
 2014 main unhone khele gaye paanch vanade main 8 wicket liye
 During the ODI career, Mishra has played 23 matches in 27 matches so far
 96 kii ausat se 45 wicket liye hai
 The record of hat-trick and zero in IPL and Amit Mishra in odis would not be an exaggeration to call Team India's irregular player, but Mishra has been playing continuously in the Indian Premier League and has also performed well
 amit mishra IPL ke sabhi saat sanskarnon main khel chuke hai or unka naam IPL main sarvaadhik wicket lene waalon main duusare sthaan par he
 Mishra has taken 102 wickets in a total of 86 matches played, just behind Lasith Malinga (119) in this list
 itnaa hi nahin unke naam IPL main teen baar hetric lene kaa record bhi he
 He first scored a hat-trick for the Delhi Daredevils in 2008 and second time in 2011, playing for the Deccan Chargers
 iske baad IPL-6 main sunrisers hyderabad kii ore se khelte hue unhone 2013 main hetric lagaai
 However, in the IPL, there is a record of his name getting out to zero
 wo 10 baar bina khaataa khole hi out ho chuke hai
 By the way, he shares this record with Gautam Gambhir
 sibiai ke fasaad par ab siyaasi bhuuchaal much gaya he
 The two senior officials of the country's largest investigative agency are accusing each other of serious charges, after which the question has also arisen as to who will find out what is right and wrong
 is sawaal par haalanki centre sarkaar ne sthiti ab spasht kar di he, lekin sarkaar ne khud ko is puure maamle kii jaanch se alag kar liya he
 1
 vishesh nideshkarakesh asthanke khilaafasibiaine exiaar darj kii thi, jisamen unke khilaaf ghoose lene kaa aarope he
 The CBI team also started an investigation against Asthana and made an arrest
 lekin asthana ne palatwaar karte hue sibiai nideshkalok vermake khilaaf hi sarkaar ko patr likh diya
 On October 23, an order was issued to send both Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana on leave
 bataa den ki alok verma ke khilaaf koi cese darj nahin he, asthana ne unke khilaaf sirf shikayati patr likhaa he, jabaki asthana ke khilaaf baqayada exiaar darj he
 2
 buudhvaar ko kendriya vitt mantriarun jetali is masale par press conference main bataaya ki sibiai ke donon bade adhikariyon ne ek duusare par aarope lagaaya he
 Therefore, both the officers have been separated from the CBI in view of impartial investigation
 unhone is karrwai ke peeche sivisi kii sifarish kaa hawala diya
 Jaitley said that on Tuesday, the CVC in its meeting had recommended under the law that these two officers could not investigate the allegations and neither an agency headed by them could investigate the allegations
 yani alok verma or rakesh asthana ko chuttee par bhejne ke peechemodisarkaar ne sivisi kii siforeeshon kaa bataaya he
 3
 jetali ne kaha ki ham donon main se kisi bhi adhikari ko doshi nahin maan rahe hai or yadi jaanch main unki bhoomika par sawaal nahin uthta to ve waapas apana kaarybhaar sambhaal lenge
 4
 arun jetali ne apane bayaan main ye bhi saaf kah diya ki sibiai adhikariyon par bhrashtachar ke jo aarope lage hai, unki jaanch centre sarkaar nahin kar sakati he, kyonki yah sarkaar ke adhikaar kshetra main nahin he
 Jaitley, citing the SBI Act, said that only the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) can investigate allegations of corruption related to the agency
 yani sarkaar ne spasht kar diya ki asthana yaa alok verma main koun sahi or koun galat he, iskaa pataa lagane ki liye sivisi esaiti kaa gathan karegi, sarkaar kaa isamen koi role nahin rahegaa
 5
 arun jetali ne kaha ki maamle main kendra sarkaar apane adhikaar kshetra main rahete najar rakh sakati he, jaanch se uskaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 6
 vahiin rakesh asthana ko piem narendra modi kaa 'pasandida' bataane vaale congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke aarope par jetali ne kaha ki jaanch main sirf saboot myne rakhte hai, red yaa blue ai nahin
 After completing three years of BJP government, PM Modi has once again moved to America, the most powerful country in the world
 ye pradhanmantri kaa paanchavaa america daura he magar wo pehali baar america ke maujuuda raashtrapati donald trump se milenge
 It is clear that Modi has a big chance to correct the sluggishness in the indo-us relations after Obama's departure
 sutron kii maane to bharat ke sarhad paar aatankwaad or bharat kii afghanistan main saraahneey bhoomika kaa zikr joint statement main ho saktaa he
 On 26th, the world's oldest democracy and the head of the largest democracy will be face to face
 america raashtrapati donald trump se piem modi isse pehletin baar phonpar baat kar chuke hai magar pehali baar donon netaa mil rahe hai
 The relationship can get heated up given the unmistakable and accommodating style of the two leaders
 aise main kootnithik najariye se ye mulaakaat behad mahatvapurn he
 Just before PM Modi's visit, two members of the US House of Representatives introduced a bill to end Pakistan's non-nato partner status
 zaahir he isse pakistan kii mushkilen badhengi or bharat ke liye ye acchhee khabar he
 The Trump administration has also tightened its stand on the Haqqani network and other terrorist organizations flourishing in Pakistan
 aise main trump or modi ke bich baatcheet bharat kii aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai ko majboot kar sakate hai
 It is possible that a ban should be agreed on any new organization or terrorist boss
 vahiin sutron ke mutabik sarhad paar se paidaa honevaale aatankwaad or bharat ke afghanistan main sakriy bhoomika kaa bhi zikr joint statement main kiya ja saktaa he
 There may be an announcement to take some new steps on the strategic and economic table between the two countries
 donon hi is kshetra main ek duusare ko aadan pradaan karte rahe hai
 India's concerns over Trump's new order on A-1B visas have also increased
 gauratlab he trump kii america first niti kii tahat ech1bi visa ke niyamon ke vishleshan kaa aadesh jari hua he
 Modi can express India's concern in this matter with Trump
 vahiin trump ke aane ke baad se bharatiyon par lagaataar badhate hamalon ko lekar bhi modi abhi tak khamosh hai
 However, the Paris Agreement is also being overshadowed on this tour
 trump ne america ke vakout ke liye china or bharat ko zimmedaar tehraaya tha
 The challenge is to strengthen the friendship of PM Modi in the last three years
 uttar pradesh kii satta sanbhaalane vaali siem yogi adityanath ne rajya garibon ke liye kai elaan kiye the jisamen ek bada elaan tha ki isi satr se sabhi sarkari schuli bacchon ke liye dress, sweater, juute mojey or kitaaben sarkaar muhaiyaa karaayegi
 All things got divided in schools but even after the cold started, the children have not got sweaters
 yogi ne kiya tha wadamukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne farmaan jari kiya tha kii soobe ke sabhi praathmik skulon ke chaatr-chaatraon ko dress ke alaava sweater or juute-mojey bhi die jaaengen
 But even after half-december has passed, sweaters have not been distributed to the nauranhals in government schools
 system kii let-latifi thand se thithurate bacchon par baari pad rahi he
 It seems that Yogi Adityanath's confession has been reduced to papers, although the minister claims that the sweaters will be distributed in December
 dhooma main bacchon kii classupi main sarkari skulon kaa samay subah 9 baje se dopaher 3 baje tak he or bina sweater ke bacchon kii kakshaen dhoop main lagavani pad rahi hai
 After examining Banda's school, it was found that the children of government school here are studying in winter without a sweater
 yahaan ke basic shiksha adhikari ne bataaya ki janapad str se kaam shuru ho gaya he or yahaan bhi jald hi sweater baant die jaaenge
 From here login process has been done on the Purchase Portal, to protect from the cold, class is taking place in the sun, soon sweaters will also come
 chunaav kii vajah se tender main dereebundelkhand ke jhaansi ke sarkari skool kii haalat bhi banda jaisi hi he
 The principals and teachers who teach the children here say that the children are poor, such parents are unable to earn
 yahi vajah he ki shashan kii ore se bacchon kodress or schuli bastamila tha
 Along with this, the Yogi regime has also promised to give sweaters and shoes and socks in winter
 sardi ke mausam ko do maah biit chuke he lekin abhi tak bacchon ko dene ke liye na to sweater aaye or na hi juute-mojey
 Due to this, children are forced to read without a sweater in this cold winter, although the children who have sweaters come to school wearing them
 jhaansi ke praathmik vidhyalay ke principal bataate hai ki sweater chunaav ke kaaran nahin aa paae hai
 Even the tenders have not been submitted yet, it seems that by the end of this month, we will come
 thithurane ko majaboor schuli bachepurvi uttar pradesh ke devaria kaa bhi yahi haal he
 Here too some similar pictures were found which were supposed to give a shiver
 devaria janapad main jab hamane sarkari praathmik skulon kii taraf rukh kiya to tasviren hairaan karne vaali thim
 Poor students were studying in the frost due to lack of sweaters in schools
 inke pair main juute nahin the
 These children say that we did not get a sweater and cold is enough
 bina sweater ke hi ham skool aa rahe hai
 The assistant teacher of the school in Deoria told that information was received that the sweaters and shoes are to be made available to the children, but the tender has not been done yet
 hangaamaa badhane par lakhanu main basic shiksha mantri ne kaha ki disambar main sweater or mojey bacchon ko mil jaaenge
 However, half the winter has passed, now it is to be seen whether the children are able to wear sweaters in January
 logon ke dimag main police kii chhavi kaaphi kharaab bani hui he

 html The BJP has once again slammed Sonia Gandhi
 naaraazgi is baat ko lekar he ki aakhir cabinet ne sonia ke loksabhaa kshetra raibareli main mahila vishwavidhalay sthapit karne kaa faisla kyon liya
 BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad quipped that the cabinet took this decision to please Sonia, but the government has to remember that the common man lives outside Rae Bareli
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki agar congress ne puure desh kaa khyaal rakhaa hota to aaj unki haalat patali nahin hui hoti
 BJP is beginning to feel that now Congress will be swept away in the storm of change
 haalanki bijepi kii naaraazgi khaadya suraksha bill par jari adhyadesh ko lekar he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that when the government's colleagues like Mulayam Singh Yadav are demanding that the bill be passed in Parliament, why did the government make haste
 bijepi ne ashanka jataayi ki adhyadesh ye jataane ke liye he ki sonia gandhi iske peeche hai
 If it was passed in the Parliament, it would have been the fief of the whole Parliament, that is, the monsoon session is expected to once again be an uproar as all parties are getting electoral color

 The Principal Chief Commissioner of Delhi Office has issued an order to all employees regarding the dress code
 ye nirdesh us ek ghatana ke baad aayaa he, jab offis kii party main ek karmchaaree jeens or tii-shart pahanakar pahunch gaya tha
 In this order issued by the Delhi office of the Income Tax Department, it has been said that all officers and other employees should wear formal clothes
 aadesh main kaha gaya he ki cajual or party viyar koi bhi offis main pahanakar nahin aana chahie
 Against the employees who do not accept this dress code, the Department of Income Tax has also said to take action
 aadesh main kaha gaya he ki jo log is aadesh kaa paalan nahin karenge, unke khilaaf sudharatmak karrwai kii jaaegi
 The order said that under corrective action, those people who would come to office in the casual and party wear would be sent back home
 in karmchaariyon ko kapade badalakar dress code main hi offis aane ke liye kaha jayega

 apni saahas bhari lekhnee or bebaakbayani ke kaaran mannu bhandari ne hindi katha-jagat main apni ek alag pahchaan banaai he
 He was born 3 April 1931 in Bhanpura Nagar, Madhya Pradesh
 unhone kahani or upanyaas likhe or khub charchit huin
 The stories of the collections 'I lost', 'A picture of three eyes', 'one plate swamp', 'this is the truth', 'aankhon dekha liar' and 'hung' collections underlined his ongoing awareness, active growth
 Huh
 rajendra yadav ke saath likhaa gaya unka upanyaas 'ek inch muskaan' padhe-likhe or aadhuniktaa pasand logon kii dukhabhari premgautha he
 His straightforward language, simple and intimate style of style, simple craft and capturing a pulsating moment of life through storytelling are among the features that made him popular
 naatak 'bina deevaaron kaa ghar' bhi charchit rahaa par vivaah tuutane kii traasadee main ghut rahe ek bachche ko kendriya vishay banaakar likhe gaye unke upanyaas 'aapkaa banty' ne unhen shoharat ke shikhar par pahunchaa diya
 This novel is included in the queue of Hindi's most successful novels
 naukarshahi main vyaapt bhrashtachar ke bich aam aadmi kii pidaa or dard kii gaharaai ko ukerne vaale unke upanyaas 'mahabhoj' par aadhaarit naatak khub lokapriy hua tha
 His Rajinigandha film, based on his 'this is true' work, made a lot of noise at the box office
 is film ko 1974 kii sarvshereshth film kaa puraskaar bhi praapt hua tha
 In addition, he was awarded the Shikhar Samman of the Hindi Academy, Delhi, Government of Bihar, Indian Language Council, Kolkata, Rajasthan Sangeet Natak Academy, Vyas Samman and Uttar Pradesh Hindi Sansthan, starting from Baliganj Shiksha Sadan, Rani Birla College in the prestigious Miranda College in Delhi
 Manu Bhandari, a professor of Hindi, is an amazing writer in many ways
 naitik-aniatik se pare yatharth ko nirdvandv nigahon se dekhnaa unke kathy or unke kahan ko hameshaa nayaa or aadhunik banaata he
 'your Bunty' is one of those unique novels without which neither the twentieth century Hindi novel can be talked about, nor the female discourse can be understood on the right plane
 saal 1970 main likhaa gaya yah upanyaas darjanon sanskarnon va anuwaadon ke baavjood aaj bhi vaise hi lokapriy he, jaisaa dharmayug main pehali baar dharawahik ke rup main prakaashan ke dauraan tha
 'your Bunty' is a classic novel
 ise hindi sahitya kii ek moolyawaan uplabdhi ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The specialty of this novel is that it portrays a child's wounded sense of emotion, in which the state of separation in a middle-class family becomes a nightmare of a child's world
 sabhi ek-duusare main aise uljhe hai ki paariwarik traasadee se upji sthitiyaan sabhi ke liye yatnaa ban jaati hai
 It is difficult to tell whether this story is of a child Bunty or mother Shakun
 shakun ke jivan kaa satya he ki stri kii jaij mahatvakanksha or aatmanirbharta purush ke liye chunauti he- nattejey main daampaty tanaav se use algaav tak laa chodta he
 This is true of the 'new woman', not of Shakun, who constantly makes her place in the society, spreads and increases her stature
 pati-patni ke is dwand main yahan bhi vahi sabase adhik pisa jaataa he, jo nitant nirdosh, nirih or asurakshit he- or vah he banty
 This world of elders was first recognized by the narrator Mannu Bhandari in the child's consciousness
 bal manovigyaan kii gahari samaj-boojh ke liye charchit, prashansit is upanyaas kaa har prishth hi marmasparshi or vicharottejak he
 For the readers of Sahitya Aaj Tak, an excerpt of 'your Bunty': xxrep 4 * The time for Shakun was stalled for a long time
 yon ghadi kii sui to baraabar hi chalati thi
 In the morning, the sunlight illuminated the whole house by entering from the courtyard - in the afternoon, it would sit in the lawn spread in the afternoon, and in the evening, the big alasayi would hide slowly in the back hills, sliding slowly
 ek-duusare ko thelte hue mausam bhi aate hi rahe
 Still, Shakun felt that as the time has frozen and this frozen time rock did not melt or break
 bas, tuutati rahi he to shakun- dhire-dhire, til-til
 In fact, this feeling of stagnation has been equal for the last two-three years, but here for a year, this feeling would have been as sharp as it was unbearable
 saamne khadi lambii chhuttiyaan or garmi ke behad lambey alas or udhaas din! college kya band ho jaayenge jaise samay guzaarane kaa ek acha-khaasaa bahaanaa khatam ho jayega
 Otherwise, going to college in his extremely eventless life is also important for an event
 college, or college ke saath judi anek samasyaon kii aad main vah kam se kam kisi main vyast rahane kaa santosh to paa leti he
 Otherwise, there is nothing in his own life that can create excitement even for a moment
 banty yadi sir ke bal khadaa ho gaya, to usee ko lekar vah uttejit-sa mahasoos karti rahati he
 If she did not eat properly or that she stubbornly cried at something or that she had asked something that a child of this age should not ask, she would get upset even if she was excited
 haalaanki bheetar hi bheetar vah bhi kahin jaanati he ki inamen se koi bhi baat use sahi arthon main uttejit karke nahin thakaati, varan sahi arthon main uttejit hone ke praytn main hi vah thak jaati he
 It does not just get tired, it breaks in a way
 par kal vakil chachaa ne uske saamne jo prastaav rakhaa or aaj jiske liye ve phir aanevaale hai, usne use bheetar se jaise puri tarah jhakzor diya
 However, she is unable to understand what was so new in yesterday's talk, which she is so upset or upset about
 ek bahut-bahut puraani, samaptpraaya-si kahani kii punrariti hi to he! phir ? phir bhi kuch he ki sari baat ko vah bahut sahaj dhang se nahin le paa rahi he
 Looks like he has been completely churned
 vakil chachaa jab bhi aate hai, ek baar vah puri tarah math jaati he
 Even then, nothing happens from outside, not even a leaf is moving, but inside the mind, it has to face so many storms and storms
 usne jhele hai
 Ajay's intimation about growing up with someone and then settling down with him had stung him so much
 akele rahane ke baavjood tab ek baar phir nae sire se akelepan kaa bhav jaagaa tha, bahut tikhaa or katu hokar
 The feeling of humiliation had greatly increased that sting
 or koi ek saal se upar hua, chachaa ne hi aakar kaha tha, ‘‘kya bataaen, kuch samaj main nahin aata
 He has a tangle of mind about Bunty, and that is what sometimes happens
 
 
 ’’ to vah upar se neeche tak krur santosh se bhar gai thi
 Even without wanting, a slight ray of hope flashed in his mind
 koun jane banty hi
 
 
 Uncle gave toys for Bunty, so why was it known that these are not just for Bunty
 banty ko madhyam banaakar us tak bhi kuch bheja gaya he
 After that Ajay himself came
 hameshaa kii tarah alag hi tehra, alag hi rahaa or keval banty ko bulawaaya
 Did not even meet him, yet Shakun seemed not to have joined him again like Ajay
 us din ajay ke paas se lautne par vah badi der tak banty ko dularti-puchkaarti rahi thi, maano banty vahaan se akelaa nahin lautaa ho, apane saath ajay ko bhi le aayaa ho
 But slowly, even that may have ended, at least it became clear that to expect anything from her is completely futile
 or uske baad se baraabar yah lagata rahaa he ki ab sabakuch samaapt ho gaya he, antim or nirnayaatmak rup se
 And since then, time was frozen for him, like Shila
 chachaa ne kal baat shuru karne se pehle kaha tha, ‘‘ab to koi ummid nahin he
 "so he felt that he neither had hope, nor ever had before
" phir kis baat kii ummid ? phir se saath rahane kii koi chaahana uske man main nahin thi
 He has torn the lines of his and Ajay's relationship many times - despite being very involved in the whole situation and being very neutral with the whole situation, but the conclusion has always been that the two have never loved each other
 
 shuru ke dinon main hi ek galat nirnay le daalane kaa ehsaas donon ke man main bahut saafe hokar ubhar aayaa tha, jis par har din or har ghatana ne keval saan hi chadhaai thi
 The agreement was also not intended to create an understanding between the two, but to aspire to defeat each other and adapt
 tarkon or bahason main din bitate the or thandi laashon kii tarah lete-lete duusare ko dukhi, baichaiyn or chatpataate hue dekhne kii aakanksha main raaten
 There was a strange fight going on inside that too, in which both of them waited every day to see when the front man breathed out and he knelt down, so that he then with great generosity and forgiveness all his crimes
 Forgive and accept him, turning his entire personality into a void
 or is sthiti ko laane ke liye sabhi tarah ke daanv-pench khele gaye the- kabhi komalta ke, kabhi kathorta ke
 Sometimes with the generosity that robs us, sometimes with the kindness that covers everything
 prem ke naatak bhi hue the or tan-man ko dubo denevaale vibhor kshanon ke abhinay bhi
 i do not know, even in those moments there was never any emotion, emotion or excitement, but perhaps the kind hearts of both of them never accepted them in that form
 donon hi ek-duusare kii har baat, har vyavhaar or har adaa ko ek nayaa daanv samajhane ko majaboor the or is majaburi ne donon ke bich kii duuri ko itnaa badhaayaa, itnaa badhaayaa ki phir banty bhi us khai ko paatane ke liye sethu nahin ban sakaa, nahin bana
 The torture of living together was also a terrible and the tragedy of separation
 alag rahakar bhi vah thanda yuddh kuch samay tak jari hi nahin rahaa, balki anjaane hi apni jeet kaa sambhaavnaaon ko ek nayaa sambal mil gaya tha ki alag rahakar hi shaayad sahi tareeke se mahasoos hoga ki samnevaale ko khokar kya kuch amuly kho diya he
 And every news, every thing of lawyer uncle was making these possibilities
 samnevaale ko parajeet karne ke liye jaisaa sayas or sannaddh jivan use jeena padaa usne use khud hi parajeet kar diya
 The person in front does not even know when he has moved away from the scenario and till today he is standing in the same posture, in the same position - holding his breath, gripping, gripping and prosthetic! Ajay had more desire to fall than to raise
 vah swayan kabhi apana lakshya rahi hi nahin
 There was an unseen unknown challenge, which she felt hanging in the air in front of her all the time and as she faced it, she kept moving forward while battling with him
 par itane par bhi jab samnevaala nahin tutaa to uski sari pragati uske apane liye hi jaise nirarthak ho uthi thi
 Yesterday it came to mind for the first time that if she had set her eyes on Ajay instead of herself, she might not have suffered so much mental torture
 tab uskaa har badhata hua kadam, uski har uplabdhi use kuch paane kaa ehsaas to karaati
 But not anymore bich main mez par dastakhat kiye hue kaagaz ek gilaas ke neeche dabe hue fadafada rahe hai
 Shakun is sitting on this side of the table and on the other side is the lawyer uncle
 kitne dinon ke baad usne ajay ke hastakshar dekhe the or dekhakar ek ajeeb-si anubhuti hui thi, par chaahakar bhi vah use naam nahin de pai
 There was a chapter, which was to end and it was done
 das varsh kaa yah vivaahit jivan- ek andheri surang main chalate chale jane kii anubhuti se bhinn na tha
 Suddenly like today she has come to the end
 par aa pahunchne kaa santosh bhi to nahin he, dhakel die jane kii vivash kachot-bhar he
 But how is this end? Neither light nor openness
 na mukti kaa ehsaas
 It seems as if this tunnel has left him at the mouth of another tunnel - then another journey - the same darkness, the same loneliness
 uske apane hi man main jane kitne-kitne prashn tair rahe hai
 Didn't Ajay's relationship with him get overshadowed by himself? Didn't she also want to be free from him? Then what ? How is this bite? Has she been expecting anything from Ajay till date? No, it is not the sting of not being able to get anything from Ajay, but it is probably because of how someone else got everything from Ajay, which was attainable
 yaa ki is baat kaa tha ki vah sab kuch tod-tadkar nikalati or ajay uske liye dukhi hota, chatpataata
 We could not live together, so we are not living together, the situation would have remained the same even then, how much would have changed! If there was no Meera with Ajay but someone with her
 
 
 sach poocha jaae to ajay ke saath na rah paane kaa dansh nahin he yah, varan ajay ko haraa na paane kii chubhan he yah, jo use uthte-baithte salti rahati he
