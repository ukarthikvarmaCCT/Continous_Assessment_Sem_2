 According to sources, the income tax exemption limit is 2
 5 lakh rupee se badhaakar 3 lakh rupee kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, it is possible to declare a tax slab of 10 per cent on income of 5 lakh to 8 lakh rupees
 agar aisa hota he to 5 saal baad pehali baar tex slab main badlaav hoga
 In addition to the tax exemption limit on investment 1

 pehle standard didction kii rakam 40 hajaar rupee thi
 Explain that there is a cess of 4% with tax
 agar badlaav hua to kya?agar sutron ke mutabik slab main badlaav hota he to 3 lakh tak kii kamai karne vaale logon ko tex ke jaal se mukti milegi

 If there is a change in the slab, then Ramesh will have to pay only 10% of the tax on the earnings of 8 lakhs
 haalanki ramesh nivesh or standard didction kii chhot kaa phayda uthaakar tex ke jhanjhat se batch saktaa he
 What happened in the Interim Budget Changes: In the Interim Budget, a rebate was announced to those earning up to 5 lakhs
 iskaa matlab he ki yah ribet sirf unheen ykardaataaon par lagu hoga, jinaki salanaa aay paanch lakh rupee tak he
 If the income of taxpayers is more than 5 lakh rupees, then the initial limit of income tax exemption will be 2
 50 se zyada kii puri aamadani par tex dena hoga, vah bhi ses or sarcharge ke saath
 However, income tax payers with an income of more than five lakh rupees can bring their income under rebate through various types of investments

 asp Honesty and honesty are the most important thing for any relationship
 ham sabhi aise logon se hameshaa sach hi bolte hai, jinhen ham sabase zyada pyaar karte hai
 Actually, you share all your things with the person you love
 aapke raaj, phir hamraaj ke ho jate hai
 This increases mutual understanding and coordination between the two
 lekin jivan ke kuch raaj aise bhi hote hai, jinhen kisi bhi haal main apane saathi ko nahin bataanaa chahie
 Even if the partner asks very strongly, do not talk about it
 taal den
 Because it can have a direct effect on your current rotation
 jaane, jivan ke koun se raaj apanejivanasathiko kabhi nahin bataanaa chahie

 This question can not only cause your embarrassment, but because of this your current relationship can also be broken
 agar koi ladkaa apse is bare main poochta he to uske iraadon ko bhaapen or alert ho jaaen
 Because no right person should have any meaning with your past
 koi bhi samajhadaar vyakti apane rishte ke vartmaan or bhavishya par focus karata he
 Not on partner's past
 isliye yadi koi aapse yah sawaal karata he to aapako apni eemaandaaree dikhaane kii jarurat nahin he
 2
 kya aap ab bhi apane eks ko yaad karti hai
 
 
 Although it is normal to miss an ex boyfriend while in a new relationship
 lekin iskaa arth ye nahin hota ki aap unhen apane jivan main waapas chaahate hai
 You may have lived many beautiful moments in that relationship
 unki yaad aana laazmi he
 But it is not necessary to reveal those memories to your spouse
 isse mushkilen hi badhengi
 So never open this secret in front of your spouse
 3
 Did your x ever raise a hand on you
 
 
 agar aapke eks ne kabhi aap par haath uthaaya he yaa usase marpet hui he, is bare main apane jeevanasathi yaa vartmaan bwoyfriend ko kabhi naa bataaen
 Neither remember old and bad memories nor share them with anyone
 kyonki isse aapako hi takalif hogi
 4
 eks ke saath kya thilife kii planningpast lover ke saath uske saath kii gai life planning bhi past kii baat ho gai
 So do not share it with your current partner
 un puraani yojanaon se apke vartmaan saathi kaa kya lenaa dena
 Create new plans with your life partner
 puraani baaten kar apane or apane saathi ke bich miunderstanding naa paidaa karen

 The RSS chief said on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee program of the Prahar Samaj Jagriti Sanstha in Nagpur that this is happening because "we are not doing our work properly
" '' unhone kaha,‘‘bharat ko aazaadee milane se pehle desh ke liye jaan qurbaan karne kaa vakt tha
 During the war after independence, one has to sacrifice life at the border
 (lekin) hamaare desh main (is vakt) koi yuddh nahin he phir bhi log (sainik) shahid ho rahe hai
 
 
 Because we are not doing our work properly
 ''unhone kaha, ‘‘agar koi yuddh nahin he to koi kaaran nahin he ki koi sainik seemaa par apni jaan ganvaae
 But this is happening
 '' unhone kaha ki ise rokane or desh ko mahaan banane ke liye kadam uthaae jane chahie
 He said, "and so there was a time for our country to die, when there was no freedom
" ab azaadi ke baad apane desh ke liye marane kaa samay simaaon par rahata he, jab yuddh hota he to
 "rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief, Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat said," There is martyrdom even if there is no war here

 "(input bhashaa se) Even before the formal conclave of Lok Sabha elections 2019, the stir in the politics of Uttar Pradesh has intensified
 upi main siyaasi baaji apane naam karne ke liye buaa-bhatija yani mayawati or akhilesh yadav ne saath aane kaa man bana liya he or ummid kii ja rahi he ki shanivaar ko sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko lekar aupchaarik elaan ho saktaa he
 However, till now the Grand Alliance has not announced in UP that there have been reports of pulls in allies regarding seats
 rashtriya lokdal ke sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, areldi mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa ho gaya he, magar abhi tak siton ko lekar sahmati nahin bani he
 RLD chief Ajit Singh has said that his party is part of the SP-BSP grand alliance, but the seats have not been discussed so far
 ajit singh ne kaha ki congress ko lekar sapa or basapa faisla karegi ki use loksabhaa chunaav ke maddendar gathbandhan main rakhana he yaa nahin
 However, if sources are to be believed, the RLD has demanded 5 seats from the SP-BSP alliance, while the SP-BSP alliance is ready to give three seats to the RLD
 darasal, areldi ne jin paanch siton kii maang kii he, vah hai- hathras, kairana, bagpat, muzaffarnagar or kairana
 However, the seats have not yet been fully agreed upon
 darasal, siton par baatcheet ko antim rup dene ke liye do din pehle jayant choudhary akhilesh yadav se milane lakhanu gaye the
 Akhilesh Yadav has assured him of seats there
 baharaahal, shanivaar ko hone vaale akhilesh yadav or mayawati ke saajha press conference main jayant choudhary press conference main nahin jaaenge
 Let me tell you that on Saturday, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati will hold a joint press conference at the Taj Hotel in Lucknow and will formally announce the grand alliance
 vahiin khabar yah bhi he ki mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke sapa-basapa ko lekar aupchaarik elaan se pehle upi congress kii team bhi dilli main marathon baithak karegi or aage kii ranneeti par charchaa karegi
 The Congress will also discuss the future strategy in view of the BSP-SP alliance and will include Raj Babbar and PL Punia
 raajnneetik galiyaaron main aisi charchaa he ki uttar pradesh kii ye donon badi partiyaan yani sapa-basapa37-37 loksabhaa siton par saath milakar chunaav ladengi
 Please tell that there are a total of 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh
 upi kii siyaasi galiyaon main charchaa is baat par bhi he ki basapa-sapa gathbandhan main amethi or raibareli kii siten chhod di jaaengi or vahaan kisi bhi ummidavaar ko nahin utaara jayega
 The seats remaining after this will be left for the Rashtriya Lok Dal and other smaller parties
 yani sapa or basapa ke bich gathbandhan kii baat sahi sabit hoti he to iskaa matlab he ki congress is gathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin hogi or upi kii anya kshetreey partiyon ko jodne kii sapa-basapa purajor koshish karegi
 If seen in this way, if the SP-BSP meets, then the Congress will be a big shock
 saath hi saath bijepi ke liye bhi kisi bade jatke se kam nahin hogi
 Explain that in the assembly elections where BJP 39
 6% vot mili to sapa or bispi ko 22 fisadi
 If both votes are mixed, then it becomes 44 per cent
 congress ko maatr 6 fisadi hi vot mili the
 At the same time, talk of Lok Sabha elections 2014, BJP 42 in Uttar Pradesh
 6% vot mili the
 SP got 22 percent and BSP got 20 percent votes
 baharhaal, aisi khabaren hai ki 15 janvari ke baad siton ke bantwaare ko antim rup diya ja saktaa he

 The script of this entire game was written by BJP itself

 jo kaam chhod diya wo chhod diya
 Everyone explained to Manjhi that understand the game plan of BJP
 'bhaavana ke aadhaar par diya tha istipha, maafee maangata hunnithish ne kaha, 'logon kii baat par maine kadam uthaaya

 The Supreme Court stayed the Patna High Court's order to set aside Bihar's law prohibiting drinking and sale of liquor
 hoicourt ne jin sharaab nirmaataaon kii yachika par pratibandh kanoon ko darkinar kiya tha, supreme court ne un sharaab nirmaataaon samet sabhi prativaadiyon se jawaab maanga
 On the basis of the petition of these defendants, the High Court had declared the Nitish Kumar government's ban law illegal and unconstitutional
 supreme court ne is maamle kii sunwaayee ab 8 saptaah baad karegaa
 It is noteworthy that a hearing was held in the Supreme Court today against the High Court's order to repeal the liquor ban law in Bihar
 bihar sarkaar ne 30 sitambar ke patna hoicourt ke aadesh ko supreme court main chunauti di thi
 The Bihar government's petition has said that the repeal of the High Court's prohibition of liquor law was a setback to the Bihar government's prohibition
 hoicourt ne policy ko radd karte hue yah nahin dekha ki samvidhan kaa artical 47 rajyon ko niti nirdeshak tatv ke tahat aisi policy banane kaa adhikaar detaa he
 The Supreme Court itself has said in several of its orders that the state government can issue notifications regarding prohibition of alcohol
 tippaniyan a judge in the High Court believes that drinking alcohol is a fundamental right, while the views of the Chief Justice of the Bench differ
 bihar main sharabbandi kanoon janhit main he or ise samaaj ke bade tabake khaastaur par mahilaon ne saraahaa he kyonki sharaab kii vajah se unki ghar kii aamadani jaati rahi, karj ho gaya or gharavaalon ke swasthya tabah ho gaye

 bihar sarkaar kii yachika main kaha gaya he ki hoicourt ke sharabbandi kanoon ko radd karne se bihar sarkaar kii sharabbandi kii muhim ko jhatka laga
 The High Court, while repealing the policy, did not see that the Article of the Constitution empowers 47 states to make such policies under the Directive Principles of Policy
 khud supreme court ne bhi apane kai adeshon main kaha he ki rajya sarkaar sharabbandi ko lekar notification jari kar sakati he
 The comments hoicourt main ek jaj maanate hai ki sharaab pinaa moulik adhikaar ke tahat he jabaki bench main shaamil chif justise ke vichaar isse alag hai
 The liquor prohibition law in Bihar is in the public interest and has been praised by large sections of the society, especially women, because their household income has been lost due to alcohol, debts have been incurred and the health of the families has been destroyed
 bihar main mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar ne 1 april se desh main nirmit sharaab kaa nirmaan, vyapaar, bikri or seven pratibandhit kiya tha

 " mumbai ke paas mokhada adivasee belt main pichley 3 maheene main kuposhan se 10 mauton kii khabar aa chuki he
 On Thursday, a minister of the state got the idea of how angry people are about this
 maharashtra ke janajaatiy mantri vishnu saawaraa kuposhan se mare logon ke parivaar waalon se milane ke liye mokhada taluka ke khoch gaanv gaye the
 Seeing the minister in front, a tribal woman got angry
 is mahila kaa saath gaanv ke or logon ne bhi diya
 People did not allow the minister to keep them in their homes
 bataa den ki saawaraa palghar jile ke prabharee mantri (gardian) bhi hai
 The sad aspect is that when the ministers were talking, the conceit of being a minister was clearly visible in their tone
 aisa nahin lag rahaa tha ki wo unke aansu pochhne aae hai jinke gharon ke chiragkuposhanki vajah se bujh gaye
 The ministers were even heard saying that they cannot come here? Seeing the minister, the tribal woman said, 'where were you when my son died
 yahaan se mumbai kii duuri sirf 50 kilometre he or aapako yahaan aane main 15 din lag gaye
 i do not want to meet you 'mantri ko ye sab sunaate hue mahila kaa video viral ho gaya he
 In the video, a debate can be seen between the minister and the people
 logon ke gusse ke saamne ek nahin chali, to unhone ulate pair lautne main hi apni bhalaai samajhi
 This attitude of the minister was also surprising because he himself is a tribal and represents a safe seat for this community
 mantri kaa ye ravaiya iske baavjood tha ki maharashtra ke governor vidyasagar raav ne kuposhan se ho rahi mauton ko bahut gambhirtha se liya he
 The governor has also directed the Maharashtra government to take effective steps in this direction immediately
 taaja report ke anusaar mokhada ilaake main shuukravaar ko bhi do saal kii ek bacchee kii maut hui
 Maharashtra has a very poor record for deaths from malnutrition
 khaas taur par adivasee bahut jovarmokhada ilakemen hi beete ek saal main 600 bacchon kii maut kuposhan kii vajah se ho chuki he

 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav khatm hone ke baad sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr shuru ho rahaa he
 The central government can take a big decision on triple talaq
 shuukravaar ko teen talaak ko sangyeya main rakhte hue gaiyr-jamaanti aparaadh banane vaale bill ko cabinet se manjuuri mil sakati he
 The bill provides for punishment of up to three years for granting triple talaq
 cabinet kii manjuuri ke baad sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main ise pesh kiya jayega
 Significantly, according to highly placed sources in the government, the government will bring legislation in the winter session of Parliament to end triple talaq
 sarkaar ‘da muslim vimen protection of ritis in marij act’ naam se is vidheyak ko laaegi
 This law will only apply to three divorces (INSTANT TALAQ, ie divorce-e-biddat)
 is kanoon ke baad koi bhi muslim pati agar patni ko teen talaak degaa to wo gaiyr-kanoonee hoga
 Henceforth, three divorces granted in any form, whether oral or written or in a message, would be invalid
 jo bhi teen talaak degaa, usko teen saal kii sajaa or jurmaana ho saktaa he
 That is, giving triple talaq would be a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 isamen magistrate tay karegaa ki kitna jurmaana hoga
 PM Narendra Modi had formed a group of ministers to legislate on triple talaq, which included Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, PP Chaudhary and Jitendra Singh

 haalanki raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne shanivaar ko hi saaf kiya tha ki rafel saude par agar congress koi bhi sawaal uthaati he to uskaa jawaab dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 The defense minister also said that the Rafale deal cannot be compared to the Bofors scam
 neerav modi ke jawaab main kartivhin, modi sarkaar neerav modi ke jawaab main karti chidambaram kii ienex maamle main hui giraftaar ko congress ke bhrashtachar se jodakar is mudde ko hawa degi

 baan ne kaha ki is din se libian janata kaa bhavishya puri tarah uske apane haathon main hoga

 Referendum means where images are created to turn public opinion all the time
 aaj har raajnneetik dal ke paas peshewar janamatshaala he, jo har vakt chhaviyon ko gadhati rahati he
 Such images begin to be produced and broadcast parallel to the bad images, so that Netaji looks great again
 is ranneeti ke saath ki buree chhaviyaan dhundhlee pad jaaengi
 Many such referendums are open in this Delhi city
 mujhe to puraa shahar hi janamatshaalaon kii kadi kii tarah lagata he
 We always find ourselves in the operation theater after becoming a journalist
 har mudda ek beemaari kii tarah nazar aata he, jiske ek hisse kii kataai-chantai karte hue hi khud ko maharathi doctor samajhane lagate hai
 While the whole body played in that disease or what effect the entire body had from that operation, it is not known
 ham ek naagarik yaa voter banane ke romaanch or tanaav se vanchit ho jate hai, kyonki sara oparation ham apane sukh yaa behatari ke liye kam duusare ko bataane ke liye kar rahe hote hai
 You said this to me as a voter how you must have gone through all the political events
 aapaki apni nishtha, tatastha kin-kin ghaaton se takaraati hogi
 Politicians or political parties keep exercising to be in your eyes at all times
 unhen is baat kaa khoff sataata hi hoga ki kahin aapaki nigaah main na gir jaaen yaa koi gira na de
 Although this has happened in every phase, i am seeing in my time that whenever the image of the leader falls, he starts to create new images
 kya raajnneeti sirf chhaviyon ke prabandhan kaa hi khel he
 It is a legitimate political process and right to worry about images and to keep communicating constantly, but can you differentiate between this legitimate concern and propaganda
 ho saktaa he ki puure vibhaag se log pareshaan hon, magar ek aadmi ke kaam ko lekar whats-ap se lekar fasebuk tak par tasviren thel di jaati hai
 This is propaganda
 asli sawaalon ko chota karne ke liye aisi sachhee tasveeron kaa jaal bicha dena, jisase lage ki vaaki vah sawaal ahm nahin hai
 Would the voter not be able to go beyond the process of producing these images? kya vah un sawaalon ko bhul twitor, fasebuk par thele gaye nae abhiyaanon par mohit ho jaataa hoga
 Whenever a leader gets involved in controversies, seems to have fallen into the eyes of the people, he gets involved in a variety of exercises
 logon ke bich jane lagata he, kuch duusari acchhee baton kaa prasar karne lagata he
 Through social media, by applying his pictures while doing positive or some work, he starts putting new layers of soil on his bad image in a way
 is kaam ke liye janamatshaala main ek se ek maahir log lagaae jate hai, jinhen pani kaa bulbula se lekar sabun-surf sab bechney kaa tajurba hasil he
 i am seeing such campaigns on Twitter and Facebook daily
 koi feeta kaat rahaa he to kisi ke file sin karne kii tasviir jari kii gai he
 These pictures show the leader working tirelessly, while none of these campaigns collide with the original questions
 balki un sawaalon ko chhod duusari chhaviyaan gadhane main lag jate hai
 If you help someone, you launch a new scheme
 kahin jaakar lanbaa-lanbaa bhaashan de aate hai
 Such pictures are posted on Twitter
 tivi ke liye nayaa campan launch kar diya jaataa he
 Public relations should continue in politics, but public relations means that instead of contacting the public and going to the public to shine their image, then a voter should raise their ears
 jansampark sirf or sirf chhavi prabandhan kaa department banakar rah gaya he
 It does not show honesty to connect with people and listen to them
 dilli ke akhabaaron main sudur rajyon ke vigyaapan chhapane lage hai
 Why this campaign is conducted in Delhi after spending crores of rupees, why not in our states
 kya iskaa matlab yah he ki yahaan ke akhabaaron main likhane vaale log dilli se baahar nahin dekh pate
 Outside photos have to come to Delhi on their own
 chhaviyon se chhaviyon ko dhakne ke bich janata yaa voter ko dekhnaa chahie ki uski zindagi badal rahi he yaa nahin
 Whether or not the life around him has changed
 uske naate rishtedaaron kii zindagi badal rahi he yaa nahin
 The idea of creating a new image on the basis of images alone is to underestimate the innate intelligence of the people
 yah likhane kaa uddeshy itnaa bhar jaananaa he ki aap in saare prayaason ko kis tarah se dekhte hai
 Is it really a big thing for you that a leader came among you or sent a congratulatory message on Twitter or you can see the real work by removing the veil from the mist of all these images
 bataaiega
 Till then enjoy the images made in Delhi which is a referendum
 bas itnaa jaan lijie ki har nai chhavi pichhali kerani par ek pardaa he

 " In the year 2002, July 13, Indian 'boys' Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif won the final of the natwest Trophy after chasing the 'impossible' victory target given by the host England at Lord's ground called 'mecca' of cricket

 After an almost 'impossible' victory, Sourav Ganguly took off his shirt in the Lords' balcony and waved it with full fervor, and then jumped into the ground and jumped over Kaif and cheered him
 
 
 bhartiya prashansakon ne ganguli kii is harakat ko kuch hi maheene pehle farvari, 2002 main mumbai ke vankhede stadium main england ke andrew flintoff kii milti-julati harakat ke munhtod jawaab ke rup main dekha
 
 
 Flintoff also expressed the joy of winning the Mumbai match to tie the series at 3-3, taking off the shirt and running around the stadium
 
 
 tippaniyan Although Sourav later said that his action was due to 'vakti Josh', some people have been calling it a smear in the name of the lord's magnificent and rich heritage

 Among the most spectacular wins on foreign soil in India's cricketer history, this unprecedented victory is credited to Mohammad Kaif and Yuvraj Singh as well as captain Sourav Ganguly, who is known for his combative thinking, attitude and disturbing opposition players
 He was famous for answering the antics of 'jaise Ko Tit'
 
 
 saurav ganguli ne lagbhag 'asambhav' jeet ke baad lords kii balcony main apni shart utarkar use puure josh se laharaaya tha, or uske baad maidan main jaakar caff ke upar kudakar unase lipatakar khushi zaahir kii thi
 
 
 Indian fans saw Ganguly's act as a befitting reply to a similar act by Andrew Flintoff of England at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai in February 2002
 
 
 flintoff ne bhi mumbai match jitkar shrunkhlaa ko 3-3 se baraabar karne kii khushi shart utarkar or bhaagate hue stadium kaa chakkar lagaakar zaahir kii thi
 
 
 The comments haalanki saurav ne baad main kaha tha ki unki vah harakat 'vakti josh' kii vajah se hui, lekin kuch log ise lords kii shandaar or samrudh viraasat ke naam par dhabba bataate rahe hai

 Indian fans saw Ganguly's act as a befitting reply to a similar act by Andrew Flintoff of England at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai in February 2002
 
 
 flintoff ne bhi mumbai match jitkar shrunkhlaa ko 3-3 se baraabar karne kii khushi shart utarkar or bhaagate hue stadium kaa chakkar lagaakar zaahir kii thi
 
 
 The comments haalanki saurav ne baad main kaha tha ki unki vah harakat 'vakti josh' kii vajah se hui, lekin kuch log ise lords kii shandaar or samrudh viraasat ke naam par dhabba bataate rahe hai
 
 
 But Virender Sehwag, who considers Saurav to be his 'real life hero' even today, remembers it with pride

 pakistani sena pramukh general ashfak parvej kayaani ne janata ko aashwast kiya he ki desh main aam chunaav 11 may ko hi honge

 (from input language) paanch saal pehle apane jite-ji usne apane hi kaatilon kaa naam bataaya tha
 Five years later, the court has now declared the same people as murderers
 yani katl se pehle hi wo apane kaatilon kaa faisla bhi suna chukaa tha
 But at the time of mentioning the name of the slayer, he himself did not know with which weapon he was going to be killed
 anderworld main rahete hue bhi wo anderworld ke us nae hathiyaar se anjaan tha, kyonki is nae hathiyaar kii khaasiyat yah thi ki ye jaan bhi le letaa or kisi ko pataa tak nahin chalata
 Suresh Bhagat, aka Matka King
 
 
 yahi naam he us shaks kaa, jo pichley bees saalon se mumbai ke anderworld or mataka bazaar par berokatoke raaj kar rahaa tha
 Over the years, Suresh earned crores from his gambling business and spent more than that
 jurm kii duniya main apana mukaam banaae rakhane ke liye
 The matka king continued to rule this black world of Mumbai
 agar anderworld ne uske khilaaf apane nae hathiyaar kaa istemaal naa kiya hota
 
 
 a weapon, which is sure to kill the enemy, but it leaves no evidence after it is done
 ye hathiyaar bana detaa he har maut ko ek aisa haadasa, jiskaa sach koi nahin jaan paata
 But for the first time, the investigation of Mumbai Police was revealed that the underworld's way of sleeping the death of its enemies, Mumbai police itself was shocked
 marane se pehle mataka king ne khud apni hi maut kii kahani sunai
 Shortly after being told, Matka King was literally killed, but in a unique way
 kya tha wo tarika or kyon maaraa gaya mataka king? mataka king kii maut ke paanch saal baad shuukravaar ko mumbai kii ek adaalat ne uske katl ke iljaam main chah logon ko doshi qaraar diya he
 These six people include the wife and son of Matka King himself, whose name he took on the camera of Jeet Ji Aaj Tak
 mataka king ke kaatilon ko milane vaali sazaa kaa elaan ab somvaar ko hoga, lekin jaaniye mataka king kii zindagi or maut kii kahani, jise anderworld main pehali baar suni or sunai gai
 Six people have been convicted for the murder of Matka King
 ab aap jaananaa chaahate honge ki aakhir kya he wo hathiyaar jiskaa istemaal anderworld ne mumbai ke mataka king suresh bhagat ke khilaaf kiya? use ek aisi khamosh maut dene ke liye, jisapar koi ungali nahin uthaa saktaa tha
 In fact, these vicious gangsters of the underworld had created a full proof plan against Bhagat, which had no chance of failing
 ye hathiyaar isi plan kaa sabase ahm hissaa tha
 Suresh Bhagat aka Matka King used to speak at Matka Bazaar in Mumbai
 kalyaan mataka ke naam se chalane vaale jue ke is dhandhe ko suresh ne mumbai or maharashtra ke baahar gujarat or rajasthan tak failaa diya tha
 In this business, Suresh Bhagat made a profit of crores of rupees, but in the business, Bhagat, who is quadrupled by night, was defeated by his own family members
 suresh kii bivi jaya or uskaa betaa hitesh dhandhe ko lekar uske khilaaf ho gaye
 Now Suresh started threatening his life with his wife and son
 lihaaja suresh ne mumbai police kii krime branch ke paas apni bivi or bete ke khilaaf likhit main ek shikaayat bhi darj kara di
 In fact, Suresh Bhagat knew that his wife Jaya had connections with Suhas Rogge, the crook of the Arun Gawli gang
 suresh ye bhi jaanata tha ki jaya use thikaane lagane main suhas kii madad kabhi bhi le sakati he
 In such a situation, despite registering a complaint with the police, Suresh Bhagat had started being smart with the danger hovering on himself
 usne apni security or badha di thi
 But the matter was worth crores, so Bhagat's wife was also not going to give up
 suhas roge kii madad se usne gavali gang ke badmaashon ko bhagat ke khilaaf chappe-chappe par failaa diya
 The challenge was to install Bhagat in such a way that even the snake dies and the sticks do not break
 aakhirkaar gang ke logon ne tay kiya ki suresh ko thikaane lagane ke liye na to chaaku kaa istemaal kiya jayega, naa bandook kii goli kaa
 The miscreants also bypassed the idea of bombing the Matka King, as they needed a method of killing that would do their job and leave no evidence behind
 aakhirkaar gang memberon ne tay kiya ek aise hathiyaar kaa istemaal, jo anderworld main aaj se pehle kisi ne nahin suna
 The Gawli gang fixed the day of Suresh Bhagat's death
 taarikh thi teraa june
 The day when Matka King Suresh Bhagat was to return to Mumbai from Alibaug by road
 vakt aa chukaa tha, jab anderworld ko apana ye hathiyaar pehali baar aajmaana tha
 Gang henchmen ambushed on the road from Alibaug to Mumbai
 hathiyaar chalaane vaala mustaidi se apni jagah le chukaa tha
 
 
 And just now all these were waiting for the passing of Matka King
 suresh bhagat us roj apane khilaaf ek cese ke silsile main alibagh gaya tha
 He was to return to Mumbai directly after dealing with the court action
 lihaaja wo apni scorpiyo gaadi main apane chah saathiyon ke saath mumbai jane ke liye savaar ho gaya
 The driver remembered God as usual before driving, then set out on the road to Mumbai
 is baat se bekhbar ki aane vaale raste main unki maut unka intjaar kar rahi he
 Bhagat and his companions had just reached the halfway point when a truck coming from the front hit their car so strongly that Bhagat's car fell down the road with one stroke
 takkar itani joardaar thi ki scorpiyo ke parakhche ud gaye
 Suresh Bhagat and his six companions died on the spot
 isi ke saath kaamyaab ho gaya anderworld kaa wo plan, jiske tahat mumbai kaa mataka king hameshaa ke liye raste se hataa diya gaya
 The gangsters of the Gawli gang had cleverly manipulated a truck into a weapon to eliminate Bhagat
 gang ke gurgey jaanate the ki agar unhone mataka king ke katl ke liye kisi duusare tareeke kaa istemaal kiya, to police unhen der-saver dhund jarur nikaalegi
 That is why, by giving betel to a truck driver instead of a sharp shooter, he made this murder an accident
 magar chunki suresh bhagat apane maare jane kaa andeshaa pehle hi jataa chukaa tha, isliye police kii tafteesh main kaatil kaa cheharaa or katl karaane kaa makasad, donon saaf ho gaye
 The police arrested Harish Mandvekar, who had given him a contract of three lakhs, including the absconding truck driver and Suhas Rogge of Gawli gang, who gave him the contract for 45 lakhs
 baad main tafteesh ke dauraan sari kahani saamne aa gai
 Since Matka King himself had taken the name of his own murderer after his victory, the work of justice became easier
 ab doshiyon ko adaalat kya sazaa detii he, iske liye somvaar tak kaa intjaar karnaa hoga

 The opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games, from the conch shell to the 1500-year-old 'dung Chain' and the learning of Bihu and Bhangra to Yoga, witnessed a wonderful view of unity in Indian culture and diversity
 
 jawaharlal nehru stadium main yojit bhavy samaaroh main bhartiya samskruti ke anuroop udghaatan kii shuruyaat shankhanaad se hui or phir dang chen ne darshakon kaa man moh liya
 When the sound of conch and dung chain resonated in the sky simultaneously, it seemed as if a big religious event was about to begin
 dang chen bharat ke sabase puraane vaadya yantron main shaamil he
 If the conch is started by blowing, then the drum is also never left behind
 nagaadon par ulti ginati shuru hui or jaise hi yah shunya par pahunchi to phir stadium main chaaron taraf se shankhanaad hone lage
 This was just the beginning of the view of Indian musical instruments
 iske baad desh ke vibhinn hisson ke drum vaadakon ne darshneey chatha bikherkar videshi darshakon ko bhi jhuumane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 It started with Manipur's distinctive classical dance 'pang Cholam' which is based on Manipuri Sankirtan music and Manipur dance
 isamen nartak drum bajaate hue nrity kar rahe the
 As if every audience thronged with Bhangra in Punjab, drummers from North India, Dholu Kunita, Gaza Dhol and Bengal also performed brilliantly
 nagaada or visheshkar been kii dhwani ne kaanon main ras maadhuri ghol di
 Every spectator present in the stadium played applause for Koya drum players and especially the young tabla player Keshav
 pehle keshav table par thap chodta or dramvadak unki lay ko aage badhaate
 This amazing view of Jugalbandi can be seen only in India with diverse culture
 khelon ke walantiaron ko shuru main hi sikhaaya gaya tha ki vah mehmaanon kaa abhivadan ‘namaste’ kahkar karen to phir udghaatan samaaroh main bhala ise kaise bisar diya jaataa

 Yoga, which has been established in Indian culture since ancient times, has established its roots in Western countries, but today an amazing display of athletic yoga was seen in the entire stadium here
 yoga ko aksar suryoday ke samay kiya jaataa he or aise main yoga kar rahe kalakaaron ne chamakate surya kii akruti banaayi
 The Seven Chakras have been an important part of Indian culture

 brallep ke baad apane eks ko kol, massej karnaa band kijiye
 Unfriend / block them from all your social media accounts
 ye mat sochie ki brallep ke baad bhiaap dost rah sakate hai
 Not possible
 agar aapane aisa sochaa, to isse aapaki hi pareshaani badhegi
 It is not easy to recover from the pain of deep relationship breakdown
 aksar aisa hota he ki tanaav kii vajah se log khaanaa-pinaa chhod dete hai yaa zarurat se zyada vasayukta khaanaa khaane lagatehain
 They lock themselves in the room, do not get out, do not even talk to people

 So eat nutritious food and your fitness routine par laut aaiye
 Remember, the 'first happiness is a physical body'

 After the breakup, there is a tsunami of emotions inside you
 lekin use shant karne kaa sabase badhiya tarika he shopping karnaa
 This formula also applies to boys
 brallep ke baad log sabase pehle apana luk badalte hai
 New clothes, new haircut, new style will help your breakover
 ye puri prakriya aapako tanaav Free and will help to distract attention from 'them'
 brallep ke baad kuch aisa karen, jo aapane pehle kabhi nahin kiya ho, yaa karne se dar lagata ho
 Try an adventure sport, go to bars alone, do the most 'dangerous' exercise in the gym, talk to a stranger
 kehane kaa taatpary he ki aap apane daayaron ko badhayen
 This will boost your confidence
 aap hameshaa se kis jagah janaa chaahate the? vahaan jaaiye

 agar aapkaa 'eks' aapako vahaan jane se roktaa tha, tab to zarur jaaiye
 It is not possible to go with friends, so go alone
 apni suraksha kaa khyaal rakhen
 If you are thinking of solo trip, then take advice from family and friends too
 kehete hai, jo hota he achche ke liye hota he
 Admittedly, you are deeply saddened by your breakup
 lekin iskaa acha pahalu ye he ki isse aapke apane faislon, kamiyon, hasaraton or khoobiyon ke bare main sochane kaa bharpoor samay milegaa

 During a hearing in the US on Monday against the Mumbai terrorist attack co-accused Tahawwur Hussain Rana, the prosecution said that Pakistani intelligence agency ISI had links with Rana and David Headley
 chicago ke darksen sangheey building main sunwaayi ke dauraan america sahaayak atarni general sarah striker ne kaha ki pakistani mul ke canadai naagarik rana ne pakistani mul ke america naagarik hedli se mumbai aatankwaadi hamale ke baad kaha ki bhartiya isi laayak the
 In the year 2008, 166 people were killed in this attack
 striker ne kaha ki rana ne apane puraane mitra hedli kii madad kii jisane mumbai hamale se pehle vahaan nishaanaa banaaye jane vaale sthanon kii toh lete samay photo khinchi
 With this, Rana introduced Headley as a representative of his Chicago-based immigration industry
 rana kii sunwaayi par puure vishwa kii najar he kyonki isse mumbai hamale ke liye jimmedaar tehraye jane vaale pakistan ke aatankwaadi sanghathan lashkar e taiyaba or pakistani guptchar agency ke bich sandigdh sambandhon kaa khulaasa ho saktaa he
 ISI has been under scrutiny since Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in Abbottabad on May 2
 50 varshiya rana ne apana aparaadh sweekaar nahin kiya he lekin pakistan ke sainik skool ke samay ke uske mitra hedli (50) ne apana aparaadh sweekaar kar liya he
 a 12-member bench is hearing the matter
 rana kii pairvi kar rahe ek america vakil charlie swift kaa kahana he ki unke muvakkil ko uske pakistani mul ke dost or sandigdh aatankwaadi david colman hedli ne dhokhaa diya
 Rana did not know that his business was being used for his escape
 swift ne kaha, rana kaa sirf yahi kasoor he ki vah hedli kaa dost tha or uske saath kaarobaar main saajhedaar tha
 Headley betrayed my client
 unhone kaha ki rana ne apane is dost ke saath milakar kaarobaar shuru karne se zyada kuch nahin kiya
 The striker stated, the defendant neither picked up the gun nor threw the grenade
 ek jatil sajeesh main kaam karne vaale sabhi sadsy hathiyaar kaa istemaal nahin karte
 People like defendants who support such conspiracies are very important for its success
 rana ke vakil ne kaha ki unke muvakkil ko uske puraane mitra ne dhokhaa diya or use nahin pataa tha ki store main kya he
 Swift told the bench that Headley was a manipulative person who used to balance many things
 isamen ek hi samay main lashkar e taiyaba, pakistani guptchar agency iesai or america maadak padaarth pravartan prashasan ke liye kaam karnaa shaamil tha
 However, the striker said that Rana was well aware of what he was doing
 unhone kaha ki rana ne hedli ko apni pahchaan chupaane kaa jariya diya kyonki usne (hedli ne) use (rana ko) apane chicago sthit avrajan udyog ke pratinidhi ke rup main pesh kiya tha
 He said, the defendant was well aware that people could be killed when Headley traveled to a country abroad
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar peeth ko ve sakshya dikhaaegi jisamen hedli or rana ke bich hue email ke sandesh shaamil hai jo gupt sanketon main likhe gaye hai
 He said that Headley considered Rana his best friend in the world
 rana aaropapatr main saatvaan aaropee he or aisa ekmaatr prativaadee he jo hiraasat main he
 Six others are absent including Major Iqbal and Sajid Mir who are allegedly observers of lashkar-e-taiba

 There is an atmosphere of happiness in some places about the removal of Article 370 (article 370) of the Government of India from Jammu and Kashmir, while some people are opposing it
 haal hi main priyanka chopra (priyanka Chopra) or jaayra wasim (zaira Wasim) kii apakaming film 'da ski ij pink (the Sky Is Pink)' kii diarector shonali bose (shonali Bose) ne jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataae jane ko lekar apana gussa jaahir kiya he
 Posting a picture of herself with actress Zaira Wasim through her Instagram account, Shonali said, "my heart is heavy seeing the dark clouds darken on Indian democracy
 " # notmyindia
 It has been two weeks since the unprecedented communication blockade of Jammu and Kashmir
 My heart is heavy as the sky is dark over India's democracy right now
 My heart has always ached for the terrible human rights violations in the Valley - right from the times of the Congress government in the 90's
 The disappearances and killing of innocent youth is not new
 Nor is the opening of fire on demonstrations
 But this government has crossed every line with it's draconian measures
 i want to ask every Indian - every Bengali, Maharashtrian, Gujarati, Tamilian et al - how would you feel if your state was split overnight and converted into a Union Territory? Leave Article 370 aside for a moment and answer that honestly
 For me the shock and anger at this unconstitutional act is laced with sorrow at how our own people must be feeling in this part of our country
 Feelings we can only imagine - as there is still a blackout! On a personal level i have never known anyone before in the State
 But now i have a child there
 Zaira Wasim - the heart and soul of the Sky is Pink
 i have known her and her family over one year - spent marvelous times with them in both Srinagar and Jammu
 i was with them in Jammu just a day before this happened
 Zaira was very worried that something terrible was afoot because of the sudden influx of massive troops
 i reassured her not dreaming something so draconian and unprecedented could be carried out
 And since then I'm besides myself with worry at not being able to reach her
 To give her strength at this difficult time
 To wish them Eid Mubarak
 I'm sure they couldn't celebrate it
 We parted with the promise to stay in touch every day
 Echoing a promise she and her brother make to each other in the film in a brilliantly acted and moving scene
 But i can't reach my baby right now

 Even if you keep Article 370 aside, answer it with truth

 ab main uske paas is mushkil samay main nahin pahunch paa rahi hum

 Team India has performed well so far in the ICC World Cup-2019, but the performance of the players is constantly being questioned
 mistar kool mahendra singh dhoni, keel rahul, kedaar jadhav ke baad ab rishabh pant par sawaal uthe hai
 There was a lot of debate about Rishabh Pant not being included in the World Cup squad
 aakhir main unhen chotil shikhar dhawan ke sthaan par team main jagah mili or pichley do maichon main vah bahes kaa mudda rahe
 He is playing at No
 4, but this talented player with the bat looks weak in the field
 yahi kaaran he ki captain viraat kohli or mahendra singh dhoni ko pant ko maidan par kahin aisi jagah chupaana pad rahaa he, jahaan gend kam aae
 The fielding coach expressed concern
 shridhar ne bhi england ke khilaaf khele gaye match main pant dwaar bachaae gaye paanch ranon kaa bhi vishesh zikr kiya, jisase pataa chalaa ki pant se kya ummid kshetrarakshan ko lekar kii ja rahi he
 Pant is primarily a wicket-keeper, but he has to field while Dhoni
 bangladesh ke khilaaf khele gaye match ke baad shridhar ne kaha, 'unke saath kaaphi kaam karne kii jarurat he
 First of all, he has to improve his throwing technique as well as bring the mindset that he is fielding on the field
 lekin, is samay hamaare paas abhi jo he, hamaari koshish use behatar tareeke se istemaal karne kii he
 That's why Virat Kohli and Dhoni always think of putting him in the right place at the right time so that the best can be extracted from them
 pichley match main unhone 5 ran bachaae the, jo hamaare liye bonus tha
 He also took a catch
 'baar-baar sarkal main laayaa ja rahaa thapant ko match main baar-baar seemaa rekha se waapas sarkal main laayaa ja rahaa tha
 He could not handle the entire boundary
 vah seemaa par kaich bhi nahin pakad sake, jo captain ko akhra
 Pant has become more difficult under players like Dinesh Karthik as Karthik is also a wicketkeeper as well as a good fielder
 dhoni bhi acchhee fielding kar lete hai
 Due to this, the standard of fielding for Pant has gone up
 fielding coach ne karthik ko acha fielder batayashridhar ne kaha, 'wicketiper hote hue bhi karthik achche fielder hai

 ' jaipur ke aakhri maharaja or brigadierbhavani sinhakaa aaj janmdin (22 oktober, 1931) he
 Everyone knows about the monarchy of Bhavani Singh and his work in the army, but do you know that this Maharaja of Jaipur suffered from a common leader in the electoral battle
 unhen yah haar jaipur se kai baar saansad rahegiradhaari laalbhargav se mili thi or yah ek aitihaasik chunaav tha
 The matter is about the Lok Sabha elections of 1989, when every time the Bharatiya Janata Party fielded Girdhari Lal Bhargava in the electoral battle from the Rajasthan capital Jaipur Lok Sabha seat
 vahiin unke saamne the jaipur ke maharaja bhavani singh
 Please tell that Girdhari Lal Bhargava used to come from a normal background and one of his slogans, which no one should ask, Girdhari Lal with him was very famous
 yah chunaav ek raja or ek aam aadmi ke bich tha
 Bhargava was a leader who was involved in the happiness and misery of people when he reached weddings late at night
 unhone hi kai laavaaris shavon kii asthiyon kaa visarjan kiya tha or wo apane kaarykaal main yah karte rahe
 Local experts say that even during this election he was very busy in campaigning, but he used to reach the wedding at two o'clock in the night and used to perform the rituals of unclaimed dead bodies
 iske alaava ve scooter par hi shahar main jansampark karnaa pasand karte the
 It was a little difficult for Bhavani Singh to win the election in this election
 isliye unhone aam aadmi se judane kaa kaaphi prayaas kiya or girdhaari laal bhargav ke naare ke khilaaf ek naaraa diya-'mhe thanka or the mahaara'
 It means 'we your and you our'
 kaha jaataa he ki us dauraan jaipur ke shahi parivaar ke liye aane-jane ke liye banaaya gaya 'tripolia get' bhi aam aadmi ke liye khol diya gaya tha
 However, all the claims of Bhavani Singh failed and even after long campaign, Bhavani Singh lost in this historic election by about 84 thousand 497 votes

 Neither fought a by-election nor allowed his cadres to be candidates in the panchayat elections, but with the shock of not winning a single seat from Uttar Pradesh in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and 23 percent of the vote in the 2017 assembly elections
 The regret of getting 19 seats has forced the party to consider other options as well

 For this, activists were asked to become active by making committees at the urban level

 Soon after, the work of bloodshed and spoilage started
 20 april ko doodhli main ambedkar yatra nikal rahi thi
 In such a situation it becomes necessary to know who and why hatched the conspiracy for the conflict with the Muslims

 Shiv Sena has taken a dig at Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi

 The Shiv Sena has written its editorial in the party mouthpiece Saamana that at such times Modi should put the country above his state

 'significantly, the BJP has recently appointed Narendra Modi as the chairman of the campaign committee for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections

 Chauhan, while addressing a general meeting after filing nomination papers of BJP candidate Rajkumar Meo in the Maheshwar by-election, said, “the Congress has been continuously hampering the progress of the state
 maheshwar upachunaav yahaan kii janata ke liye ek avasar he ki vah congress ko makul jawaab de or bhaajapa pratyaashee mev ko baari maton se jitaaye’

 It is the Congress's pastime to cut the fertilizer, electricity, coal, Indira cottage and ration of the poor
 isliye jaruri he ki congress ko is upachunaav main sabak sikhaaya jaae
 On this occasion, the state BJP president MP Rabhat Jha said that one of the Congress mlas cheated the people of the region by resigning from the Maheshwar seat to go to the Rajya Sabha, and secondly, the Congress did its best to not get a by-election here if the seat is vacant
 Try, which is a betrayal of the people here
 kshetra kii janata iske liye congress ko upachunaav main uchit sajaa sunayegi
 a huge rally was taken out in the city to file nomination form of party candidate Meo and while filing the form, Chief Minister Chauhan, state president Jha, besides national general secretary Thawarchand Gehlot, former MP Faggan Singh Kulaste, former state president Satyanarayan Jatia, former minister Vikram Verma, Indore Municipal Corporation Mayor Krishnamurari Moghe, Industries Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya, Health State Minister Mahendra Hardia, School Education Minister Archana Chitnis, Women and Child Development Minister Ranjana Baghel were present

 On Sunday, a new twist in the matter of buying malls and soil in Bihar came when RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav admitted that the land on which the mall is being built is in the name of his sons and party MP Prem Gupta has The land is named after his sons
 vahiin bijepi netaa susheel modi ne yah kehete hue ki unhone mantri ke taur par apane tathy salanaa declaration main nahin diye, nitish kumaar se ek baar phir apane mantrimandal ke donon sahyogiyon tej pratap or tejasvi yadav ko barkhaast karne kii maang kii he
 Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Yadav said that every man wants his boy to do business and not cling to his doll
 saath hi patna main apane nirmaanadhin mal ke bare main media se hi sawaal poochne ke lahaze main unhone kaha ki mere paas jameen he to ham uskaa vyavsaayik istemaal nahin karenge kya
 (lalu's sons have a plot of 30 crores, this is the real reason for many scams: Bihar BJP) lalu yadav ravivaar ko patna main ek sanvadata sammelan ko sambodhit kar rahe the jisamen unke saath party ke sansad or vivaadon ke centre main rahe prem gupta bhi maujuud the
 Prem Gupta, whose company was the owner of the land in the mall and later renamed it to Lalu Yadav's wife Rabri Devi and his sons Tej Pratap Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav
 gupta ne mana ki unhone jameen kaa hastantaran kiya lekin kyon kiya uskaa unhone saafe saafe jawaab nahin diya
 Although both leaders appeared angry with BJP leader Sushil Modi, most of the allegations made by Modi were accepted by Lalu and Gupta
 prem gupta ne daawa kiya ki unhone jameen bechi nahin balki share kaa transfar kiya gaya he
 Challenging BJP leader Sushil Modi, Prem Gupta said that he should go to the Prime Minister and get him investigated, he will not have any objection
 or ye bhi kaha ki modi ke mukademon kii dhamkee ke kaaran bihar main koi industry nahin lagi
 ('lalu Yadav got 72 crores of land for sons and wife for four lakh rupees)

 lalu ne modi se poocha ki wo mal kii jameen ko vivadaspad banane kii bajaay sanjay gandhi jaivik udyaan main mitti kaa mudda uthaaen
 Of course, Lalu and Prem Gupta were upset with the allegations on the mall issue
 prem gupta ne kaha ki agar mal khulegaa to logon ko rojgaar milegaa or sarkaar ko rajasav kaa laabh hoga
 (when Lalu is ready to investigate the soil scam, why is CM Nitish delaying ?: Sushil Modi) is bich bijepi netaa susheel modi ne kaha ki lalu yadav is baat kaa kyon jawaab nahin de rahe ki aakhir unke donon mantri bete tejpratap or tejasvi yadav ne apane vaarshik byore main is jameen or company main apni bhagidaari kii charchaa kyon nahin kii
 Modi once again demanded the dismissal of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on both grounds to hide this truth
 modi ne lalu yadav se jald apni anya benami sampati bhi saarvajanik karne kii chunauti dete hue kaha ki agar unhone nahin kiya tab mere paas saare kagajaat hai or main khud ise saarvajanik karuunga
 Lalu Yadav was addressing a press conference in Patna on Sunday in which he was accompanied by Prem Gupta, who was at the center of the party's parliament and disputes
 prem gupta, jinaki company is mal kii jameen kii maalik thi or baad main usne ise lalu yadav kii patni rabari devi or unke beton tejpratap yadav or tejasvi yadav ke naam kar diya
 Gupta admitted that he had transferred the land but he did not give a clear answer to why
 haalanki donon netaa bijepi netaa susheel modi se khafa dikhe lekin modi dwaara lagaae gaye adhikansh aaropon ko lalu or gupta ne sweekaar kiya
 Prem Gupta claimed that he had not sold the land but the transfer of the shares
 bijepi netaa sushil modi ko chunauti dete hue prem gupta ne kaha ki wo pradhanmantri ke paas jaakar jaanch kara len, unhen koi aapatti nahin hogi
 And also said that due to the threat of Modi's lawsuits, there was no industry in Bihar
 ('lalu yadav ne chaar lakh rupee main 72 karod kii jameen beton or patni ke naam karai

 Lalu asked Modi to raise the soil issue in Sanjay Gandhi Organic Park instead of making the mall land controversial
 nishchit rup se lalu or prem gupta mal ke mudde par lag rahe aaropon se pareshaan dikhe
 Prem Gupta said that if the mall is opened then people will get employment and the government will get the benefit of revenue
 (jab lalu mitti ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye taiyaar hai, phir CM nitish der kyon kar rahe hai? : susheel modi) Meanwhile, BJP leader Sushil Modi said why Lalu Yadav is not answering why his two minister sons Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Yadav did not discuss this land and their involvement in the company in their annual statement
 modi ne ek baar phir is aadhaar par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se donon dwaara is sachai ko chhipaane ke liye barkhaast karne kii maang kii

 Officials said Kumar, a 1989 batch IPS officer, has been asked to be present at the agency's office in Saltlake on Monday
 unhone bataaya ki sibiai ne kumaar ke khilaaf lukout notice jari kiya he
 This step has been taken against the former Kolkata Police Commissioner to prevent him from leaving the country
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki sibiai ne kumaar ko desh chhodane se rokane ke liye or unke kisi bhi sambhavit kadam ke bare main agency ko suchit karne ke liye is saptaah sabhi hawaonddon or avrajan adhikariyon ko satark kiya he
 The agency wants to interrogate Kumar, a 1989 batch IPS officer, in the Saradha Ponzi scam worth Rs 2500 crore
 vah is maamle kii jaanch sibiai ke sanbhaalane se pehle pashchim bengal police ke vishesh jaanch dal kii aguwai kar rahe the
 The CBI had told the Supreme Court that custodial interrogation of Kumar is necessary as he is not cooperating in the investigation and he is adopting evasive and obstinate attitude on the questions asked by the agency

 Arvind Kejriwal belongs to the 1992 batch of the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) and resigned in 2006
 itane din seva main rahete hue vibhageeya kaaryon main ve koi kirtiman nahin sthapit kar sake
 To my knowledge, he did not catch a single major tax evasion case
 andolan ke dauraan prachaar kiya ki ve inakam tex kamishnar rahete to karodon-arabon rupye kama jate
 The IRS Association objected to whether all the officials in the Income Tax Department were corrupt and also said that Arvind had never reached the post of Commissioner
 kya arvind yah kahana chaahate hai ki inaki patni ne iares ke pad par rahete hue karodon-arabon rupye kamaaye hai?main jab gajiabad main usee pad par lagbhag paanch saal tak rahaa, vibhaag mere naam se janaa jaataa tha or vyapaaree mujhe gabbar singh kehete the
 Will Arvind be able to see what he is seeing in practice? Not using peon in the Income Tax department, cleaning the table himself, etc
 has established simplicity from the act, but what about the recovery of tax from it? Take oath in Ramlila Maidan or in Raj Bhavan, what is it related to the promise of the public? Whether or not to stay in a government bungalow, do not take security etc
 what is the relation of running the government? My children swore that they would not support Congress or BJP, what happened to it? They have insulted democracy by getting opinion on whether to form government or not
 jab congress ne sarkaar banane ke liye sahyog diya to inhen sidhaa apane vaadon ko puraa karne ke liye sarkaar banaakar kaam karnaa shuru kar dena chahie tha
 Promises made to the public - such as 700 liters of water per day, electricity bill halved, abolition of contractual practice in cleaning work
 unhen niyamit karnaa, aniyamit coloniyon ko niyamit karnaa, sarkari skulon kaa str badhaakar public skool ke samaan karnaa, janalokapal bananaa, mohalla samiti kaa gathan, 500 sarkari skulon kii sthapana, 0 pratishat byaaj dar par dalit udhyamiyon ko rin dena aadi par fouran kaary shuru kar dena chahie tha
 The Aam Aadmi Party has reached this stage with the movement against corruption, but will it be possible? When he went on a hunger strike at Ramlila Maidan, a rally was organized by the SC / ST Confederation and he was asked why he did not include corruption of industry, media and ngos in his bill? If it was not there, then we introduced the Bahujan Lokpal Bill and ensured the reservation of Dalits, tribals, backward and minorities
 jis tarah se media, enjio or udyog jagat kaa samarthan inako he, agar iskaa aadha bhi mujhe mili to shaayad inase zyada samaaj ko prabhavit kiya ja saktaa he
 Even now, i will not have equal workers of my organization, but the way the media is showing and writing them for 24 hours, the thinking of people has become their bond, this is also a kind of fascism
 kya adhikariyon evam netaaon ke bhrashtachar kii ninda karne se desh sudhar jayega? ye kyon nahin udyog jagat, media or enjio ke bhrashtachar par kuch kehete?jab tak saamaajik nyaay kii baat na kii jaae, kya yah swasth raajnneeti hogi? saamaajik nyaay ke bare main abhi tak arvind kii koi patibaddhta nahin dikhi he

 Arvind and his companions were intentionally active to take advantage of all this in the future and the same happened in the end
 sarkaar banane ke liye jo anaavashyak propaganda arvind kar rahe hai, usase lagata he ki kaam main unka yakeen kam he or baat karne main zyada
 As Arvind is claiming, what good thing will happen to the country if it runs such a government? (the author was Arvind Kejriwal's senior in the Indian Revenue Service
