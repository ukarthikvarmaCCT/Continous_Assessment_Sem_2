 It seems that the trend of prepaid plans with long validity is increasing
 companiyaan shaayad isliye aisa kar rahi hai taaki lambey samay tak graahakon ko apane saath rakh sake
 Recently we saw that many companies are offering their 365 days validity prepaid plans
 aise plance kii sankhya dhire-dhire badhati hi ja rahi he
 Now, Vodafone has launched its new prepaid plan of Rs 1,999
 sabase pehle aapako bataa den vodaphone kaa ye nayaa 1,999 rupee vaala preeped plan philhal keval kerala cirkil ke liye hi utaara gaya he
 Also, the company has not given any information about the availability of this plan in other circles
 kerala main is plan ko open rakhaa gaya he, yani kerala cirkil kaa koi bhi graahak is plan kaa laabh le saktaa he
 Since this plan is open circle here, it is expected that the company can soon launch it for the whole country
 1,999 rupee ke preeped plan main milane vaale phaaydon kii baat karen to isamen company analimited local, neshnal or roming colling de rahi he
 As far as data is concerned, customers get 1 daily in this plan
 5GB 2G / 3G / 4G data milegaa
 Apart from calling and data, 100 SMS will be given to customers daily under this plan
 is plan kii validity 365 dinon kii hogi
 That is, you can be free for this year for one year
 vodaphone 1,999 rupee VS jeeyo 1,699 ruperiliance jeeyo ne hi desh main kifayati yearli plance pesh karne kaa trend shuru kiya tha
 Last year, the company introduced 1,699 yearly plans
 aisa hi plan baad main BSNL ne utaara tha
 After this, the names of Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel were also added to this list and these companies also started taking prepaid plans of Rs 1,699
 jeeyo ke 1,699 rupee vaale preeped plan main roj 1
 5GB data, unlimited voice calls and 100 SMS daily with 365 days validity
 vodphone bhi apane plan main isi tarah ke phaayde de rahaa he
 But the company is charging 300 rupees more for this and this Vodafone plan is also only in Kerala
 aise main jeeyo ke plan ko hi behatar samajha ja saktaa he
 Today is the second day of 'sahitya Aaj Tak', the biggest stage of literature
 duusare din kii shuruyaat mashhoor lekhak or geetkaar prasoon joshi ke saath hui
 The 'rahna Tu, Hai Jaisa Tu' issue was discussed with Prasoon Joshi on the 'dastak Darbar' stage of the program
 is kaarykram kaa sanchaalan shweta singh ne kiya
 Prasoon Joshi said here that he has objected to the fact that women are only labeled as housewives and are called non working
 prasoon bole ki aisi sangya us puure daayitv ko nakaarti he jisamen ek maa ek shishu ko bada kar kaam karne laayak banaati he
 He said that today everything that is not earning money is no longer useful
 ye jaruri nahin he ki har vyakti kaa moolyankan paison se ho
 Prasoon Joshi said that the writer is connected with one truth, which is one person to another, one creature to another
 use sabhi kii takalif dikhti he or isi cheez ko vah apni lekhnee main utaarata he
 Referring to this, he hummed, ''
 
 
 maa kii godi main sar rakh kar bah bah jaaun''
 Read it
 
 
 sahitya ajtak 2018: dastak darbar ke manch par prasoon joshivarisht lekhak prasoon joshi ne kaha ki jab aap sachhee bhaavana se likhane kii koshish karte hai, to galtiyaan hoti he
 If the audience does not like, then they should start rejecting
 unhone kaha ki aaj hamane mahilaon ke chithran ke saath hamane insaaf nahin kiya, chaahe vijuali ho yaa phir kisi or tarah se ho
 He explained that if you are showing a woman who is wearing police clothes and you are showing her body only then you have to change this thinking
 film, kala, gane har jagah ise badalanaa hoga
 
 
 
 najar tori, ghur ghuram ghurmprasun joshi ne is dauraan apni ek thumari bhi sunai, unhone bataaya ki is thumari ko unhone kal raat ko hi likhaa he or abhi bhi puri honi baaki he
 Look at the zucchini, ghouram ghoormanjar mori, leaning forward 
 
 tori najariya se shikawa nahiniyat tori dol dolam dolam
 
 nayanon ke milane kachu dar naahinigah tori jhil jheelam jheelam
 
 
 Now you cannot bear arrow like Akhian Kechubhat
 
 
 unhone bataaya ki thumari ke ang kii baariki ko mentin karte hue aage kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 When asked how he was able to write so brilliantly on the issue of women, he said that i can understand the pain of women because of my mother, grandmother, sister, wife
 prasoon ne kaha ki ab samay aa gaya he ki apni kala main over karection kiya jaae
 Some things change with law and order, some change the society
 jo gaali naa dete hue gaali de rahaa he use pakadana jaruri he
 
 
 The senior lyricist said that whenever violence or the character of a woman is presented in the name of comedy, its impact is very large
 kuch chijen parampara kii aad main ho rahaa he, jab koi vyakti gaali naa dete hue bhi gaali de rahaa ho use pakadana jaruri he
 Something like this is happening in the sensor board
 
 
 lekhak-geetkaar hone ke saath-saath prasoon joshi sensor board ke chairman bhi hai
 He now said that i have tried in the censor board, every officer there wants to work properly
 unhone kaha ki CBFC kaa kaam bada mushkil he, hamen cinematic sensotivity or socity ke bich main talmail bithaana padataa he
 He told that a scene can have many meanings to a person
 samaaj ke prati samvedansheel hona kala ke liye kaaphi jaruri he
 It would be very wrong if the connection between art and audiences was broken
 prasoon joshi ne is charchaa ke dauraan apni kai kavitaayen, geet, rachanaaon ke bare main bataaya
 Among them were compositions such as 'there is one person in all of us', 'I have forgotten under the coals of that chest', 'behold the apocalypse, beauty becomes the beauty of feeling'

 Mahamandaleshwar Computer Babaka says that as soon as he became the Minister of State, he visited the banks of Narmada for 6 months

 He promised to remove the name of the collector from the temple and write the name of the priest and make a policy for cow protection
 lekin baad main wo mukar gaye
 According to Computer Baba, cows are dying everywhere in Madhya Pradesh, the condition of saints and saints is getting worse
 lekin shivaraj sarkaar ko iske koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 This government is anti saint

 a new video of Pooja has surfaced
 gane ke liriks hai 'baapu de de thodaa cash'
 Earlier too, two videos of Pooja have come which went very viral
 haal hi main dhinchik puja ne ye elaan kiya tha ki jald hi nayaa video aayega
 Although this post has been done on Facebook from his unverified account, but this post had gone viral on the Internet

 jab contas kii udaan sankhya 682 edilade se melbern ke liye chali to maano saare shaq-shubahe or niraashaa kaa maahaul peeche chhot gaya
 Last night was a big bang for the 15 members of the Indian team and around 25,000 fans gathered here
 bharat ne vishwa cap ke liye apane abhiyaan kaa bada shandaar aagaaj kiya
 The Pakistan team once again lost to India in the World Cup
 isse is sapane ko nai udaan mil rahi thi—bharat vishwa cap jeet saktaa he
 once again
 yah bhul jaaie ki us match se pehle bharat ko australian dharti par 84 dinon main koi jeet haath nahin lagi
 Also, forget that the Pakistani team was not yet ready to deal with these situations and the previous winner India is yet to face bigger and stronger teams in more challenging conditions
 us udaan ke dauraan or shaayad daure main pehali baar mahendra singh dhoni or unki team ke sadsy 29 march kii raat ko melbern main khel ke bare main gambhirtha se soch rahe the
 There was not much time to celebrate big after the first victory but the players gathered at the Intercontinental Hotel to express their happiness
 captain dhoni ne sab ko team management se tay vyaktigat bhoomikaaon kii yaad dilaai or unhen atirikt das fisadi prayaas jhonkne ke liye prerit kiya
 When the team arrived in Melbourne and checked in at the Langham Hotel, Dhoni took off his sunglasses and smilingly asked the media people, "have lunch?" Sachin Tendulkar is thrilled with the team's debut and high hopes for the future Keep it
 bharat-pakistan match ko apane najdiki doston ke saath theatre sareekhe maahaul main dekhne ke baad tendulkar ne ajtak se kaha, ''main apane gendbaajon ke daudane ke tareeke or chust tathaa aakraamak fielding se kaaphi prabhavit hum
 i have told my friends that they can expect more from the team
 ''team diarector ravi shastri ne bhi edilade match ke do din baad melbern main practice ke dauraan yahi baat kahi, ''tendulkar sahi hai
 We have to remain positive by enjoying every win
 baaki tiimon main hamase dar baith janaa chahie
 "this is just the beginning
" lekin sanket spasht hai ki top teen timen koun-si hai
 Australia, South Africa and New Zealand are clearly ahead and India can reach the semi-finals with all three if India maintains their rhythm
 toornament kaa formet aisa he ki bharat kii team aakhri aath main to pahunch hi jaaegi lekin agar vah apane group main dakshin africa ke saath milakar top do tiimon main jagah bana leti he to quarter final main mejabaan tiimon se unke gharelu maidan par bhidane se batch jaaegi—australia se edilade main or newjiland se oakland main
 Former India captain Saurabh Ganguly told India Today in Melbourne, "well, i am not in a position to think so far but if this possibility comes true, India can get a smooth fight against Sri Lanka or England in the quarter-finals
" 
 vahaan jite to aap bas cap jeetne se keval do jeet dur rah jate hai
 "but to get closer to this dream, Indian batting has to show strength
" edilade main shikhar dhawan or suresh raina ke form kii talash aakhirkaar puri hui to viraat kohli ne is vishwa cap kii shuruyaat bhi thik usee tarah kii jaise 2011 main kii thi—shandaar shatak ke saath
 Rohit Sharma and Rahane have already shown a glimpse of their ability to play shots with a slanting bat on good bouncy flat pitches
 chintaa kii baat bas aakhri overon main dhoni kii tabadatod ballebaaji kaa nadaarad hona he
 Tendulkar says, "I am sure Dhoni's bat will come out if needed
" ''bharat kii sabase badi pareshaani uski gendbaaji he
 Although the bowlers were effective against Pakistan, it will not be so easy for them in front of strong rivals
 australia, newjiland or dakshin africa kii tiimon main taqatvar shot khilne vaale ballebaaj maujuud hai
 a score of 300 against them will not be safe
 imran khan kii 1992 kii vishwa cap vijeta team ke pramukh sadsy or purv pakistani captain ramij raja kaa kahana he, ''ant main baat netritv kii aa jaati he
 Dhoni was criticized recently in India but i often see Imran's image in Dhoni
 unhen sahi maukey par charam ko choona he, avasar kaa intjaar karnaa he or maarak prahaar kar daalana he
 By the way, this time i feel less chance of any team from the subcontinent winning the cup but if anyone wins it will be India
 ''aisi team ke liye jo pichley teen maheenon main jeet kaa swaad tak bhul chuki thi, teen baaten ahm hongi—form, fitness or jajba
 Barring a few players, the rest of the form has been haphazard, while the nature of league matches will also correct minor injuries as there is almost a week-long gap between the two matches
 bas jajba banaae rakhane kii chunauti hogi
 Dhoni has told the team that he should understand the hidden advantage behind the defeat in Test and ODI series in Australia
 bhale hi haar mili ho lekin australia jaisi majboot team ke khilaaf lagaataar khilne se bhartiya team ke pradarshan main bhi sudhaar hua he
 His mantra is simple: "take away the tightness of mind - don't let the fear of defeat go home inside you
" jo tumne siikhaa he, use hi apni takat banaao
 "the team management has prepared a roadmap for the competition with various teams, has also gathered information about their strengths, weaknesses and the mood of the key players
 ek khilaadi ne bataaya, ''hamen 2013 main champions trophy main cardiff main dakshin africa ke khilaaf jeet ke khaas ansh dekhne ko kaha gaya he—kaise hamane shuruyaat se hi aakraamak rukh banaae rakhaa or ve bhauchakk hokar jaal main funs gaye
 For example, Raina's preparations for the match against Pakistan included watching films like the Bollywood Border and LOC Kargil
 isi tarah gendbaajon se kaha gaya ki ve adatan stroke khilne vaale ballebaajon ko baandhe rakhen or unke galati karne kaa intjaar karen
 It is too early to predict whether India will be able to travel till the end, but a brilliant evening has aroused the dreams of crores of Indians

 Whether you are a producer, supplier, seller or consumer, you have to pay tax at every stage, from making goods to selling and buying
 ise ek or baar yun samajhiye ki jab kaccha maal kisi factory main aata he tab aane se pehle bhi wo kahin na kahin tex dekar aata he, factory se banakar nikalataa he to us par tex lag chukaa hota he, uske baad jab duusare rajya kii dukaan par le jaaya jaataa he to raste main kai prakaar kii chungi lagati he, phir dukaan par pahunch kar jab aap kharidte hai to waite naam kaa tex dete hai
 We call it indirect tax
 ab kaha ja rahaa he ki falana dhimkaana tex hataakar ek tex lagegaa, jiesti yani guds and services tex
 The Finance Minister has said about this tax that economic integration could not happen in the same way as the political integration of the country in 1947
 jiesti aane se apratyaksh kar pranali ek samaan ho jaaegi
 Tax levies will increase and GDP will also benefit
 waite lagu hone ke vakt bhi yahi sab daawey hue the lekin uske baad ek or tex aa gaya sarvice tex
 Now another tax is coming GST
 12 saal se ham is par charchaa kar rahe hai
 In 2003, during the Vajpayee era, Kelkar Committee started discussion of GST
 - aaj vitt mantri ne kaha ki 2006 main congress ne isaki ghoshnaa kii thi
 But even after the introduction of the constitutional amendment in 2011, there was no consensus among political parties and states
 - 15veen loksabhaa main yah bill laps kar gaya, disambar 2014 main modi sarkaar ne loksabhaa main ise dobaaraa pesh kiya
 - And in May 2015 it passed in the Lok Sabha
 raajnneetik masale ko chhod dete hai kyonki iz ikval tu hone lagegaa
 Meaning, then the Congress used to say that the BJP is not going to implement and now the BJP is saying that the Congress is not allowing it to be implemented
 tab manmohan singh kehete the ki bijepi 2004 kii haar se ubar nahin pai he or ab jetali kehete hai ki congress 2014 kii haar se ubar nahin pai he
 In his tweet dated 3 May 2014, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said chidambaram kehete hai ki madhyapradesh or gujarat jiesti lagu hone nahin de rahe hai
 We are proud of it because it would be disastrous if implemented in the current form
 is twit main shivaraj singh chouhan gujarat ke bihalf par virodh karne kaa garv kar rahe hai jabaki teen maheenaa pehle farvari 2014 main gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par maujuuda pradhanmantri kaa twit he ki 'maine saaf kiya he ki bijepi ne kabhi jiesti kaa virodh nahin kiya he lekin bina mukammal iti dhaanche ke jiesti ko lagu karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 ' hamen nahin maaloom ki jiesti ke liye mukammal iti kaa dhaancha is ek saal main taiyaar hua he yaa nahin
 The Standing Committee had also made several major changes to the Congress made bill
 lekin congress bijepi ke pahalu par baat karne se pehle zaruri he ki ham or aap jiesti ke bare main samajhen
 GST has to be passed by a two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha due to the Constitution amendment bill
 phir uske baad aadhe rajya bhi do tihaai bahumat se paas karenge tab jaakar jiesti lagu hoga
 The government aims to be implemented in 2016, but there are other steps to this goal
 jiesti ko oparation yani amal main laane ke liye
 
 
 - a GST Council will be formed, headed by the Union Finance Minister
 - sadasyon main kendriya vitt rajya mantri, rajyon ke vitt mantri honge
 - Any decision in the council will be made by three fourths of votes
 - jiesti council hi tay karegi ki jiesti tex rate kya hoga
 Excise duty, customs duty, sales tax, many types of sales, service tax, octroi, octroi and many other types of indirect taxes must be heard
 in karon ke madhyam se centre sarkaar or har rajya kii sarkaar apni kamai karti he
 Like recently several states including Delhi increased excise duty on petrol
 daam bad gaye
 For example, once a state reduced excise duty and gave relief in petrol prices
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki jiesti ke baad rajya is tarah se tex gata badha sakenge yaa nahin
 GST is explained in a slightly simpler way at the site of PRS Legislative Research according to which
 
 
 - daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki ab naanaa prakaar ke tex kii jagah ek tex lagegaa
 - But three types of this one tax are also being mentioned
 - centre jiesti, state jiesti or inter state jiesti
 Crude oil, high speed diesel, petrol, natural gas, alcohol, cigarettes are excluded from the GST list
 yah samajhnaa zaruri he ki jiesti vahaan nahin lagegaa jahaan koi chiz banati he balki sidhe vahiin lagegi jahaan wo bikati he
 Therefore, many states fear that with the introduction of GST their revenue will be reduced because the states where the goods are produced will not be taxed, this will reduce their earnings
 centre sarkaar ne isaki bharpai kaa vaada kiya he or ek pratishat kaa atirikt tex lagane kii baat kii he
 Even at the time of VAT, there was a claim of maximum tax collection and no black money
 aisa hua yaa nahin aap jaanate hi honge
 Now it is being said about GST that if there is a tax, the prices will be reduced in the whole country
 ab is bahes ko samajhane ke liye kuch takneekee baton kii tasviir dimag main banani hogi
 - Like you buy yarn before making cloth
 - ise kaccha maal kehete hai or is par tex lagata he
 - The value is added to the thread when the fabric is made from it
 - vailu judi to uske liye alag se tex laga
 - Wholesale and retail shopkeepers also have to pay tax
 alag-alag charan par tex lagane se kisi chiz kii keemat badhati jaati he, ise ham cascading effect kehete hai
 As the cards are piled up, in the same way, touching one, the rest also slowly starts falling and the speed of falling increases
 isi tarah se maujuuda kar pranali main itane charan par tex lagata he ki chizon kii keemat bad jaati he
 It is being claimed in GST that the cascading effect will be reduced
 yani chizon ke daam kam ho jaaenge
 Taxation of individual states will get rid of
 aapaki balle balle ho jaaegi
 GDP will increase and tax collection will increase i
e
 black money will decrease
 jiesti kii dar kya hogi
 Dreams can be pleasant about tax too
 lekin kitna tex lagegaa
 27 percent or 18 percent
 kya is par aasaani se sahmati ban jaaegi
 Apart from this, many questions are also arising
 tippaniyan - Governments levy different taxes on the use of the rich and poor
 - jiesti ke aane ke baad yah antar mit jayega
 - Price of things used by common man will increase or decrease
 - chote udyogon or asangathit kshetra ke udyogon kaa kya hoga
 - Right now they get many types of relief in excise duty
 - is chhot ke kaaran kai udyog khadey ho sake hai
 Now if they are taxed, will they be able to face big industries
 lakhon chote udyogon or kaarobaaron par jiesti laga to kya hoga
 If implemented in 2016, the government will have an idea of its problems in the initial year
 jo bhi he is maamle main meri koi na to behatar samaj he or na raay
 All these have been prepared for you by reading articles printed in newspapers and Economic and Political Weekly
 prayaas karenge saral tareeke se jiesti kii sambhaavnaaon or ashankaon ke bare main samajhane ke liye
 It is now being said that Falana Dhimakana tax will be replaced by a tax, GST i
e
 Goods and Services Tax
 vitt mantri ne is tex ke bare main kaha he ki jis tarah se desh kaa raajnneetik ekikaran 1947 main hua usee tarah se aarthik ekikaran nahin ho sakaa
 With the introduction of GST, the indirect tax system will become uniform
 tex kii ugaahi badhegi or jidipi ko bhi laabh hoga
 All the same claims were made at the time of introduction of VAT, but after that another tax came service tax
 ab ek or tex aa rahaa he jiesti
 We have been discussing this for 12 years
 - 2003 main vaajapeyi kaal main kelkar cameti ne jiesti kii charchaa shuru kii thi
 - Today the Finance Minister said that in 2006 it was announced by the Congress
 - lekin 2011 main samvidhan sanshodhan laane ke baad bhi raajnneetik dalon or rajyon main sahmati nahin ban saki
 The bill lapsed in the 15th Lok Sabha, in December 2014, the Modi government introduced it again in the Lok Sabha
 - or may 2015 main ye loksabhaa main paas hua
 Let us leave the political issue as it is going to be equal
 matlab tab congress kahati thi ki bijepi lagu nahin hone de rahi he or ab bijepi kah rahi he ki congress lagu nahin hone de rahi he
 Then Manmohan Singh used to say that BJP has not recovered from the 2004 defeat and now Jaitley says that the Congress has not recovered from the 2014 defeat
 3 may 2014 ke apane twit main madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha tha Chidambaram says that Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat are not allowing GST to be implemented
 hamen is par garv he kyonki maujuuda rup main lagu ho gaya to vinaashkari hoga
 In this tweet, Shivraj Singh Chauhan is proud to protest the Gujarat bijaf, while three months ago in February 2014, as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the current Prime Minister's tweet said, 'I have made it clear that BJP has never opposed GST But without complete IT infrastructure it will be difficult to implement GST
 ' We do not know whether the complete IT framework for GST has been prepared in this one year or not
 congress ke banaae bill ko bhi standing cameti ne kai bade badlaav kar diye the
 But before talking about the aspect of Congress BJP, it is important that we and you understand about GST
 samvidhan sanshodhan bill hone ke kaaran jiesti ko rajyasabha main do tihaai bahumat se paas hona he
 Then after that half the states will also pass with two-thirds majority and then GST will be implemented
 sarkaar kaa lakshya he ki 2016 main lagu kar diya jaae lekin is lakshya ke kuch duusare mukaam or bhi hai
 To bring GST into operation
 
 
 - ek jiesti council banegi, jiske mukhiya kendriya vitt mantri honge
 - Among the members will be Union Minister of State for Finance, Finance Minister of States
 - council main koi bhi faisla teen chauthai maton se hoga
 - Only GST Council will decide what the GST tax rate will be
 exise duty, customs duty, cells tex, kai prakaar ke cells, sarvice tex, octroy yani chungi, naanaa prakaar ke apratyaksh kar aapane sune hi honge
 Through these taxes, the central government and the government of every state earns their own
 jaise haal main hi dilli sahit kai rajyon ne milakar petrol par excise duty badha di
 Prices went up
 jaise ek baar kisi rajya ne excise duty kam kar petrol kii keemton main raahat di thi
 i do not know whether the states will be able to increase the tax reduction in this way after GST
 piares legislative research kii site par jiesti ko thodaa saral tareeke se samajhaayaa gaya he jiske anusaar
 
 
 - It is being claimed that now there will be a tax in place of various types of tax
 - lekin is ek tex ke bhi teen prakaar bataaye ja rahe hai
 - Center GST, State GST and Inter State GST
 kaccha tel, hai speed deazal, petrol, prakritik gas, alcohol, cigarette ko jiesti kii suchi se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 It is important to understand that GST will not be located where something is made, rather it will be directly where it is sold
 isliye kai rajyon ko bhay he ki jiesti ke aane se unka rajasav kam ho jayega kyonki jin rajyon main vastu kaa utpaadan hota he vahaan tex nahin lagegaa, isse unki kamai kam ho jaaegi
 The central government has promised to make up for it and has asked for an additional tax of one percent
 waite ke samay bhi zyada se zyada tex ugaahne or kaala dhan na banane kaa daawa kiya gaya tha
 You must have known whether this happened or not
 ab jiesti ke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki ek tex hoga to puure desh main daam kam hon jaayenge
 Now to understand this debate, some technical things have to be made in the mind
 - jaise kapadaa banane se pehle aap dhaagaa kharidte hai
 - It is called raw material and it is taxed
 - us dhaage main vailu tab judati he jab usase kapadaa banataa he
 - If you add value, then it is taxed separately
 - thok or khudara dukandaar ko bhi tex dena hota he
 Applying tax at different stages increases the price of something, we call it cascading effect
 jaise taash ke pattey dher ho jate hai usee tarah se ek ko chune se baaki bhi dhire-dhire girane lagate hai or girane kii raftaar bad jaati he
 Similarly, tax is levied at such a stage in the current tax system that the price of things increases
 jiesti main daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki cascading effect kam ho jayega
 That is, the price of things will be reduced
 alag-alag rajyon kii chungi se chhutkaaraa mil jayega
 Your bat will be bat
 jidipi bad jaaegi or tex collection badhegaa yani kaala dhan kam hoga
 What will be the rate of GST? tex ko lekar bhi sapane suhane ho sakate hai
 But how much tax will be levied
 27 pratishat yaa 18 pratishat
 Will it be easily agreed upon? iske alaava bhi kai sawaal bhi uth rahe hai
 The comments - amir or garib ke istemaal kii chizon par sarkarein alag-alag tex lagaati hai
 - This gap will disappear after the introduction of GST
 - aam aadmi ke istemaal kii chizon ke daam badhenge yaa ghatenge
 - What will happen to small industries and unorganized sector industries
 - abhi unhen excise duty main kai prakaar kii raahat milti he
 - Due to this exemption many industries have been able to stand
 - ab agar in par tex laga to kya ve bade udyogon kaa saamana kar paayenge
 What will happen if GST is imposed on millions of small industries and businesses
 2016 main lagu hua to shuruaati saal main iske jhanjhaton kaa bhi sarkaar ko andaaza to hoga hi
 In this case, i have neither a better understanding nor opinion
 akhabaaron or iconomic and polytical vikali main chape lekhon ko padhakar aapke liye ye sab taiyaar kiya he
 Will try to understand about the possibilities and apprehensions of GST in a simple way
 waite lagu hone ke vakt bhi yahi sab daawey hue the lekin uske baad ek or tex aa gaya sarvice tex
 Now another tax is coming GST
 12 saal se ham is par charchaa kar rahe hai
 In 2003, during the Vajpayee era, Kelkar Committee started discussion of GST
 - aaj vitt mantri ne kaha ki 2006 main congress ne isaki ghoshnaa kii thi
 But even after the introduction of the constitutional amendment in 2011, there was no consensus among political parties and states
 - 15veen loksabhaa main yah bill laps kar gaya, disambar 2014 main modi sarkaar ne loksabhaa main ise dobaaraa pesh kiya
 - And in May 2015 it passed in the Lok Sabha
 raajnneetik masale ko chhod dete hai kyonki iz ikval tu hone lagegaa
 Meaning, then the Congress used to say that the BJP is not going to implement and now the BJP is saying that the Congress is not allowing it to be implemented
 tab manmohan singh kehete the ki bijepi 2004 kii haar se ubar nahin pai he or ab jetali kehete hai ki congress 2014 kii haar se ubar nahin pai he
 In his tweet dated 3 May 2014, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said chidambaram kehete hai ki madhyapradesh or gujarat jiesti lagu hone nahin de rahe hai
 We are proud of it because it would be disastrous if implemented in the current form
 is twit main shivaraj singh chouhan gujarat ke bihalf par virodh karne kaa garv kar rahe hai jabaki teen maheenaa pehle farvari 2014 main gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par maujuuda pradhanmantri kaa twit he ki 'maine saaf kiya he ki bijepi ne kabhi jiesti kaa virodh nahin kiya he lekin bina mukammal iti dhaanche ke jiesti ko lagu karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 ' hamen nahin maaloom ki jiesti ke liye mukammal iti kaa dhaancha is ek saal main taiyaar hua he yaa nahin
 The Standing Committee had also made several major changes to the Congress made bill
 lekin congress bijepi ke pahalu par baat karne se pehle zaruri he ki ham or aap jiesti ke bare main samajhen
 GST has to be passed by a two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha due to the Constitution amendment bill
 phir uske baad aadhe rajya bhi do tihaai bahumat se paas karenge tab jaakar jiesti lagu hoga
 The government aims to be implemented in 2016, but there are other steps to this goal
 jiesti ko oparation yani amal main laane ke liye
 
 
 - a GST Council will be formed, headed by the Union Finance Minister
 - sadasyon main kendriya vitt rajya mantri, rajyon ke vitt mantri honge
 - Any decision in the council will be made by three fourths of votes
 - jiesti council hi tay karegi ki jiesti tex rate kya hoga
 Excise duty, customs duty, sales tax, many types of sales, service tax, octroi, octroi and many other types of indirect taxes must be heard
 in karon ke madhyam se centre sarkaar or har rajya kii sarkaar apni kamai karti he
 Like recently several states including Delhi increased excise duty on petrol
 daam bad gaye
 For example, once a state reduced excise duty and gave relief in petrol prices
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki jiesti ke baad rajya is tarah se tex gata badha sakenge yaa nahin
 GST is explained in a slightly simpler way at the site of PRS Legislative Research according to which
 
 
 - daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki ab naanaa prakaar ke tex kii jagah ek tex lagegaa
 - But three types of this one tax are also being mentioned
 - centre jiesti, state jiesti or inter state jiesti
 Crude oil, high speed diesel, petrol, natural gas, alcohol, cigarettes are excluded from the GST list
 yah samajhnaa zaruri he ki jiesti vahaan nahin lagegaa jahaan koi chiz banati he balki sidhe vahiin lagegi jahaan wo bikati he
 Therefore, many states fear that with the introduction of GST their revenue will be reduced because the states where the goods are produced will not be taxed, this will reduce their earnings
 centre sarkaar ne isaki bharpai kaa vaada kiya he or ek pratishat kaa atirikt tex lagane kii baat kii he
 Even at the time of VAT, there was a claim of maximum tax collection and no black money
 aisa hua yaa nahin aap jaanate hi honge
 Now it is being said about GST that if there is a tax, the prices will be reduced in the whole country
 ab is bahes ko samajhane ke liye kuch takneekee baton kii tasviir dimag main banani hogi
 - Like you buy yarn before making cloth
 - ise kaccha maal kehete hai or is par tex lagata he
 - The value is added to the thread when the fabric is made from it
 - vailu judi to uske liye alag se tex laga
 - Wholesale and retail shopkeepers also have to pay tax
 alag-alag charan par tex lagane se kisi chiz kii keemat badhati jaati he, ise ham cascading effect kehete hai
 As the cards are piled up, in the same way, touching one, the rest also slowly starts falling and the speed of falling increases
 isi tarah se maujuuda kar pranali main itane charan par tex lagata he ki chizon kii keemat bad jaati he
 It is being claimed in GST that the cascading effect will be reduced
 yani chizon ke daam kam ho jaaenge
 Taxation of individual states will get rid of
 aapaki balle balle ho jaaegi
 GDP will increase and tax collection will increase i
e
 black money will decrease
 jiesti kii dar kya hogi
 Dreams can be pleasant about tax too
 lekin kitna tex lagegaa
 27 percent or 18 percent
 kya is par aasaani se sahmati ban jaaegi
 Apart from this, many questions are also arising
 tippaniyan - Governments levy different taxes on the use of the rich and poor
 - jiesti ke aane ke baad yah antar mit jayega
 - Price of things used by common man will increase or decrease
 - chote udyogon or asangathit kshetra ke udyogon kaa kya hoga
 - Right now they get many types of relief in excise duty
 - is chhot ke kaaran kai udyog khadey ho sake hai
 Now if they are taxed, will they be able to face big industries
 lakhon chote udyogon or kaarobaaron par jiesti laga to kya hoga
 If implemented in 2016, the government will have an idea of its problems in the initial year
 jo bhi he is maamle main meri koi na to behatar samaj he or na raay
 All these have been prepared for you by reading articles printed in newspapers and Economic and Political Weekly
 prayaas karenge saral tareeke se jiesti kii sambhaavnaaon or ashankaon ke bare main samajhane ke liye
 Let us leave the political issue as it is going to be equal
 matlab tab congress kahati thi ki bijepi lagu nahin hone de rahi he or ab bijepi kah rahi he ki congress lagu nahin hone de rahi he
 Then Manmohan Singh used to say that BJP has not recovered from the 2004 defeat and now Jaitley says that the Congress has not recovered from the 2014 defeat
 3 may 2014 ke apane twit main madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha tha Chidambaram says that Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat are not allowing GST to be implemented
 hamen is par garv he kyonki maujuuda rup main lagu ho gaya to vinaashkari hoga
 In this tweet, Shivraj Singh Chauhan is proud to protest the Gujarat bijaf, while three months ago in February 2014, as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the current Prime Minister's tweet said, 'I have made it clear that BJP has never opposed GST But without complete IT infrastructure it will be difficult to implement GST
 ' We do not know whether the complete IT framework for GST has been prepared in this one year or not
 congress ke banaae bill ko bhi standing cameti ne kai bade badlaav kar diye the
 But before talking about the aspect of Congress BJP, it is important that we and you understand about GST
 samvidhan sanshodhan bill hone ke kaaran jiesti ko rajyasabha main do tihaai bahumat se paas hona he
 Then after that half the states will also pass with two-thirds majority and then GST will be implemented
 sarkaar kaa lakshya he ki 2016 main lagu kar diya jaae lekin is lakshya ke kuch duusare mukaam or bhi hai
 To bring GST into operation
 
 
 - ek jiesti council banegi, jiske mukhiya kendriya vitt mantri honge
 - Among the members will be Union Minister of State for Finance, Finance Minister of States
 - council main koi bhi faisla teen chauthai maton se hoga
 - Only GST Council will decide what the GST tax rate will be
 exise duty, customs duty, cells tex, kai prakaar ke cells, sarvice tex, octroy yani chungi, naanaa prakaar ke apratyaksh kar aapane sune hi honge
 Through these taxes, the central government and the government of every state earns their own
 jaise haal main hi dilli sahit kai rajyon ne milakar petrol par excise duty badha di
 Prices went up
 jaise ek baar kisi rajya ne excise duty kam kar petrol kii keemton main raahat di thi
 i do not know whether the states will be able to increase the tax reduction in this way after GST
 piares legislative research kii site par jiesti ko thodaa saral tareeke se samajhaayaa gaya he jiske anusaar
 
 
 - It is being claimed that now there will be a tax in place of various types of tax
 - lekin is ek tex ke bhi teen prakaar bataaye ja rahe hai
 - Center GST, State GST and Inter State GST
 kaccha tel, hai speed deazal, petrol, prakritik gas, alcohol, cigarette ko jiesti kii suchi se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 It is important to understand that GST will not be located where something is made, rather it will be directly where it is sold
 isliye kai rajyon ko bhay he ki jiesti ke aane se unka rajasav kam ho jayega kyonki jin rajyon main vastu kaa utpaadan hota he vahaan tex nahin lagegaa, isse unki kamai kam ho jaaegi
 The central government has promised to make up for it and has asked for an additional tax of one percent
 waite ke samay bhi zyada se zyada tex ugaahne or kaala dhan na banane kaa daawa kiya gaya tha
 You must have known whether this happened or not
 ab jiesti ke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki ek tex hoga to puure desh main daam kam hon jaayenge
 Now to understand this debate, some technical things have to be made in the mind
 - jaise kapadaa banane se pehle aap dhaagaa kharidte hai
 - It is called raw material and it is taxed
 - us dhaage main vailu tab judati he jab usase kapadaa banataa he
 - If you add value, then it is taxed separately
 - thok or khudara dukandaar ko bhi tex dena hota he
 Applying tax at different stages increases the price of something, we call it cascading effect
 jaise taash ke pattey dher ho jate hai usee tarah se ek ko chune se baaki bhi dhire-dhire girane lagate hai or girane kii raftaar bad jaati he
 Similarly, tax is levied at such a stage in the current tax system that the price of things increases
 jiesti main daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki cascading effect kam ho jayega
 That is, the price of things will be reduced
 alag-alag rajyon kii chungi se chhutkaaraa mil jayega
 Your bat will be bat
 jidipi bad jaaegi or tex collection badhegaa yani kaala dhan kam hoga
 What will be the rate of GST? tex ko lekar bhi sapane suhane ho sakate hai
 But how much tax will be levied
 27 pratishat yaa 18 pratishat
 Will it be easily agreed upon? iske alaava bhi kai sawaal bhi uth rahe hai
 The comments - amir or garib ke istemaal kii chizon par sarkarein alag-alag tex lagaati hai
 - This gap will disappear after the introduction of GST
 - aam aadmi ke istemaal kii chizon ke daam badhenge yaa ghatenge
 - What will happen to small industries and unorganized sector industries
 - abhi unhen excise duty main kai prakaar kii raahat milti he
 - Due to this exemption many industries have been able to stand
 - ab agar in par tex laga to kya ve bade udyogon kaa saamana kar paayenge
 What will happen if GST is imposed on millions of small industries and businesses
 2016 main lagu hua to shuruaati saal main iske jhanjhaton kaa bhi sarkaar ko andaaza to hoga hi
 In this case, i have neither a better understanding nor opinion
 akhabaaron or iconomic and polytical vikali main chape lekhon ko padhakar aapke liye ye sab taiyaar kiya he
 Will try to understand about the possibilities and apprehensions of GST in a simple way

 Will it be easily agreed upon? iske alaava bhi kai sawaal bhi uth rahe hai
 The comments - amir or garib ke istemaal kii chizon par sarkarein alag-alag tex lagaati hai
 - This gap will disappear after the introduction of GST
 - aam aadmi ke istemaal kii chizon ke daam badhenge yaa ghatenge
 - What will happen to small industries and unorganized sector industries
 - abhi unhen excise duty main kai prakaar kii raahat milti he
 - Due to this exemption many industries have been able to stand
 - ab agar in par tex laga to kya ve bade udyogon kaa saamana kar paayenge
 What will happen if GST is imposed on millions of small industries and businesses
 2016 main lagu hua to shuruaati saal main iske jhanjhaton kaa bhi sarkaar ko andaaza to hoga hi
 In this case, i have neither a better understanding nor opinion
 akhabaaron or iconomic and polytical vikali main chape lekhon ko padhakar aapke liye ye sab taiyaar kiya he
 Will try to understand about the possibilities and apprehensions of GST in a simple way
 alag-alag charan par tex lagane se kisi chiz kii keemat badhati jaati he, ise ham cascading effect kehete hai
 As the cards are piled up, in the same way, touching one, the rest also slowly starts falling and the speed of falling increases
 isi tarah se maujuuda kar pranali main itane charan par tex lagata he ki chizon kii keemat bad jaati he
 It is being claimed in GST that the cascading effect will be reduced
 yani chizon ke daam kam ho jaaenge
 Taxation of individual states will get rid of
 aapaki balle balle ho jaaegi
 GDP will increase and tax collection will increase i
e
 black money will decrease
 jiesti kii dar kya hogi
 Dreams can be pleasant about tax too
 lekin kitna tex lagegaa
 27 percent or 18 percent
 kya is par aasaani se sahmati ban jaaegi
 Apart from this, many questions are also arising
 tippaniyan - Governments levy different taxes on the use of the rich and poor
 - jiesti ke aane ke baad yah antar mit jayega
 - Price of things used by common man will increase or decrease
 - chote udyogon or asangathit kshetra ke udyogon kaa kya hoga
 - Right now they get many types of relief in excise duty
 - is chhot ke kaaran kai udyog khadey ho sake hai
 Now if they are taxed, will they be able to face big industries
 lakhon chote udyogon or kaarobaaron par jiesti laga to kya hoga
 If implemented in 2016, the government will have an idea of its problems in the initial year
 jo bhi he is maamle main meri koi na to behatar samaj he or na raay

 All mps are angered by Aam Aadmi Party MP Bhagwant Mann making a video of the Parliament complex
 loksabhaa or rajyasabha main aaj yah mudda uthaa or sabhi ne maan ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii maang kii he
 All the leaders believed that making such a video is playing with security
 khud loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan, maan ke is tarah ke vyavhaar se kaaphi naaraaz hai
 Sumitra Mahajan has said that action will definitely be taken against Bhagwant
 magar kis tarah kii karrwai hogi vah sabhi partiyon ke netaaon se baatcheet karne ke baad tay hoga
 Meanwhile, the speaker summoned Bhagwant Mann and expressed his displeasure over the video made by him
 maan ko unhone bataa diya ki aapkaa yah ection maafee yogya nahin he
 However, Bhagwant Mann kept repeatedly clarifying that he did not make this video with the intention of defaulting in security
 balki unhone yah video logon ko aguket karne ke iraade se banaaya tha taaki logon ko yah jaankaree ho sake ki shunya kaal main sawaal uthaane ke liye kaise-kaise prakriya se guzarana padataa he
 Mann also said that there is nothing wrong in this, BJP, Akali Dalto are making it an issue due to political reasons
 maan ke video kii sabhi partiyon ne kii nindashuukravaar subah loksabhaa or rajyasabha main jaise hi sadan kii kaarywahi shuru hui sabhi partiyon ke netaaon ne bhagwant maan ke video ko suraksha se samjhauta karne kaa aarope lagaate hue maan ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii maang kii
 There was a continuous uproar in both houses regarding this issue
 sabhi kaa yahi kahana tha ki pehle 13 disambar 2001 main sansad main hamalaa ho chukaa he or abasansad parisar kii surakshaka is tarah se video banaakar fasebuk par daalana thik nahin he aisa karnaa sabhi netaaon or desh kii suraksha ko khatre main daalane jaisaa he
 Therefore, strict action should be taken against Bhagwant Mann
 isi hangaame ke chalate sadan kii kaarywahi nahin chal pai
 Some mps have even complained to the speaker that Bhagwant Mann comes to Parliament by drinking alcohol
 ab spikar agle hafte bhagwant maan ke is maamle main faisla karegi ki unke khilaaf kis prakaar kii karwai kii jaae

 ek samaaroh main shirkat karte hue khurshid ne kaha ki yah durbhagyapurna he ki raashtragit ke rup main gaaye janevaale is geet ko lekar 50 saal baad vivaad uth khadaa hua he

 Input: Language kya dilli main sirf 32 rupee rojaanaa kii kamai par koi guzar-basar kar saktaa he? supreme court main mangalvaar ko daakhil halafname main yojana ayog ne garibi rekha kii jo nai paribhaasha tay kii he, usamen kaha gaya he ki dilli, mumbai, bangalore yaa chennai main agar chaar logon kaa parivaar maheene main 3860 rupee se zyada kharch karata he to use garib nahin mana jayega
 3860 rupees on four people means 32 rupees per day on one man
 isi tarah yojana ayog ke mutabik agar gramin kshetron main koi shaks har roj 26 rupee se zyada kharch karata he to wo garib nahin kehalaayegaa
 It will not get the benefit of a government scheme for people living below the poverty line
 sabji kii keemton main aag lagi he
 Milk prices are continuously increasing
 khaane pine kii chizon ke bhav aasmaan chhu rahe hai
 Inflation has broken the back of the common man
 lekin yojana ayog kii daleel he ki jo har roj 32 rupye kharch kar saktaa he wo garib nahin kaha jayega
 Let us know what is the definition of poverty in the affidavit filed by the Planning Commission in the Supreme Court: 1
 shaharon main jo 965 rupye prati maah kharch karte hai
 That is, those who spend 32 rupees a day in cities are not poor
 2
 In villages which cost 781 rupees per month
 yani gaanvon main jo 26 ru prati din kharch karte hai wo garib nahin hai
 3
 metro main rahane vaala 4 logon kaa parivaar agar prati maah 3860 kharch karata he
 They are not poor
 yojana ayog ne garib or garibi kii paribhaasha badal di
 Now according to this changed definition, people who spend 32 rupees in cities and 26 rupees in villages cannot avail welfare schemes
 tendulkar cameti kaa hawala dete hue yojana ayog ne kaha ki aap garib nahin he agar chaaval yaa gehun par har roj 5 ru kharch karte hai
 Now see what you will get for 5 rupees
 dilli main chaaval ausatan 22 rupye kilo he or gehun ausatan 12 ru kilo
 So for 5 rupees you will get 136 grams of rice (rs
 3) and 166 grams of wheat (rs
 2)
 yojana ayog kahata he aap garib nahin hai
 If 1 everyday
 80 ru subjiyon par kharch karte hai
 Now see 1
 80 rupye main milegaa kya180 gram aalu yaa 90 gram pyaaj yaa 90 gram tamaato yaa 180 gra lowki
 The Planning Commission says that you are not poor
 agar har roj daal par 1 rupee kharch kar sakate hai
 Now look at how much lentils will be available for 1 rupee
 dilli main daal kii ausat dar 50 ru prati kilo he
 That is, you will get only 20 grams of lentils for 1 rupee
 yojana ayog kahata hai
 You are not poor if 2 everyday on milk
 30 rupee kharch karte hai
 Now see 2
 30 ru main kitna doodh milegaa
 The price of milk is Rs 27 per liter
 lihaaja 2
 You can get only 85 ml of milk for 30 rupees
 yojana ayog kahata he
 You are not poor if you spend 112 rupees every month on LPG
 ab blike market main alpiji daron ke mutabik 112 rupye main kareeb do kilo alpiji hi mil sakati he
 The Planning Commission has told the figures to the Supreme Court
 lekin jaraa sochie kya is badhati mahangaai main 32 rupee pratidin main koi apana guzaara kar saktaa he
 Just think if a family of four can cut their life for just Rs 3860
 aap ye sawaal yojana ayog ko chhodkar kisi se bhi puuchhie jawaab milegaa aankadon se jindagi nahin chalati

 At the same time, two senior players of Pakistan, Shahid Afridi and Mohammad Hafeez said that players who are found guilty of corruption should not be spared and should be punished and given out of cricket

 He said, 'I say that if a player is found guilty in fixing, then he should not be allowed to play in domestic cricket
 beete samay main hamane kade faisle nahin kiye
 There is no use if these players are allowed to play again after serving a sentence of four or five years

 He said, 'we have many reasons for winning the assembly elections for the third time in a row
 inamen rajya kii bhaajapa sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye achche vikaas kaary shaamil hai
 In response to a question, Uma said that it is true that she was not with the BJP in the last assembly elections of 2008 and that she had fought a separate election through her Bharatiya Janashakti Party, but now she has returned to the BJP
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajash ko chah pratishat vot mili the or ab ye vot nishchit taur par bhaajapa ke paksh main jaaenge

 unhone kaha ki is ghatana ke samay vah 48 saal kii thim tathaa tab tak bhagwaan par unka vishwaas or bharosa adig tha
 It took them about 18 months to recover from this situation and believe in God

 On the other hand, if Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of the country after leaving the laboratory of Hindutva, then the CM of the largest state of the country is also a big face of Hindutva
 bijepi kii fehrist main dekha jaae to ek shaks aisa he, jisane ek daur main hindutv ke naam par apni satta ko bali chadha diya tha
 This person is Kalyan Singh, who not only lost power for the Ram temple, but he is the only person to be punished in this case
 yahi vajah he ki karsevak kalyaan singh ko bijepi kaa asli hindu hriday samraat maanate hai
 Kalyan Singh was born on 5 January 1932 in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh
 wo sangh kii god main paley bade
 Kalyan Singh, who is among the strongest leaders of BJP, is currently the Governor of Rajasthan
 ek daur main ve ramamandir andolan ke sabase bade chehron main se ek the
 He was identified as a radical Hindutva and sharp speaker
 haalat ye thi ki kalyaan singh kaa naam aate hi muslim samaaj ke log naak-bhun sicodne lagate the
 On 30 October 1990, when Jabulayam Singh Yadav was the Chief Minister of UP, he opened fire on kar sevaks
 prashasan karsevakon ke saath sakht ravaiya apana rahaa tha
 In such a situation, BJP put forward Kalyan Singh to counter him
 kalyaan singh bijepi main atal bihari bajpeyi ke baad duusare aise netaa the jinke bhaashanon ko sunne ke liye log betaab rahete the
 Kalyan Singh used to speak in fiery tone, people would like his style
 kalyaan singh ne ek saal main bijepi ko us mukaam par laakar khadaa kar diya ki party ne 1991 main apane dam par upi main sarkaar bana lee
 Kalyan Singh became the first Chief Minister of the BJP of UP
 sibiai main daayar aarope patr ke mutabik mukhyamantri banane ke thik baad kalyaan singh ne apane sahyogiyon ke saath ayodhya kaa daura kiya or ram mandir kaa nirmaan karne ke liye shapath lee
 Not even a year had passed before the Kalyan Singh government that on 6 December 1992, the disputed structure was demolished by the kar sevaks in Ayodhya
 jabaki unhone sarvocch nyaayalay main shapath patr dekar kaha tha ki uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke rup main, vah masjid ko koi nuksaan nahin hone denge
 Despite this, on 6 December 1992, the same administration which used to act harshly with kar sevaks during Mulayam's era, was watching the spectacle as a mute spectator
 saream babari masjid vidhwans kar di gai
 Kalyan Singh was held responsible for this
 kalyaan singh ne isaki naitik jimmedaari lete hue 6 disambar 1992 ko hi mukhyamantri pad se tyaagptr de diya
 But on the second day, the central government dismissed the BJP government of UP
 kalyaan singh ne us samay kaha tha ki ye sarkaar ramamandir ke naam par bani thi or uskaa makasad puraa hua
 In such a situation, the government sacrificed in the name of Ram temple
 ayodhya main babari masjid giraae jane or uski raksha na karne ke liye kalyaan singh ko ek din kii sajaa mili
 The Librahan Commission set up to investigate the Babri Masjid demolition gave a clean chit to the then Prime Minister VP Narasimha Rao but planned, misused power, attracted youth for support, and the direct intervention of the RSS into the state government by Chief Minister Kalyan and his government Criticized
 kalyaan singh sahit kai netaaon ke khilaaf sibiai ne mukadmaa bhi darj kiya he
 Let me tell you that whatever happened in Ayodhya 25 years ago was openly open
 hajaaron kii taadaad main maujuud karsevakon ke haathon hua
 The event took place in front of Murali Manohar Joshi, Ashok Singhal, Giriraj Kishore, Vishnu Hari Dalmia, Vinay Katiyar, Uma Bharti, Sadhvi Ritambhara and LK Advani present on the stage
 inase masjid ko bachaane kaa rokane kaa jimmaa kalyaan singh par tha
 Whatever politics the BJP has today is the result of the Ram Mandir movement
 iske liye laal krishna adwani ke saath-saath kalyaan singh kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 It is due to this Ayodhya that today Narendra Modi is the Prime Minister of the country
 laalkrishna adwani ne jab somnath se ayodhya ke liye rathyatra nikaali thi to narendra modi unke sarathi the
 After this, in the train which was burnt in Godhra in 2002, the deceased were also kar sevaks who were returning from Ayodhya
 iske baad gujarat main danga hua or narendra modi kaa ubhaar hua
 Here Kalyan Singh became anonymous over time, but he is still the Hindu heart emperor for kar sevaks
 kyonki ramamandir ke liye unhone jo kiya he
 No BJP leader has shown it by doing

 ek vakt halaat aise ho gaye ki unhen chup kara diya gaya lekin baad main bukkal nawab ne apane bayaan par safai di ki vah masjid ke khilaaf nahin hai
 After the dispute in the Minority Front Working Committee, General Secretary of Minority Front, Iftikhar General Secretary explained the matter, saying that some members made a mistake in understanding what the Nawab was saying, which led to the dispute

 mangalvaar kii mulaakaat ke baad bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke bich bhale hi sandhi kii baat kii ja rahi ho, magar adwani ke khaas sahyogi sudhindra kulkarni kuch or hi ishaara kar rahe hai
 Kulkarni, who was led by Advani for PM campaign in the last Lok Sabha election, has described Narendra Modi as a 'dictator' and party president Rajnath Singh as a 'fox like intention'
 kulkarni ne likhaa he ki ek taanashaah ko gaddinshin karne kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 In this turn, an ideal democratic leader has not only been sidelined, but he is also being insulted
 spasht taur par yahaan kulkarni kaa ishaara narendra modi ko bijepi chunaav prachaar cameti kaa chairman banaae jane or is kram main adwani ko kinare kar die jane kii taraf he
 Sudhindra, who was imprisoned in the Cash for Vote case, does not stop here
 vah likhte hai ki khud kii sochane vaala ek netaa, jo sanghathan kaa hameshaa tiraskaar karata rahaa he, jiske apane rajya ke saathi hameshaa jhallahat kaa shikaar rahe hai, aaj achaanak taqatvar ho uthaa he
 Has become the leader of bjp's national plans
 jabaki hameshaa tyaag karne vaala, khud ke bajaay dusron kii sochane vaala or dashakon se eent-eent jodakar party banane vaala netaa is tarah kinare kar diya gaya he, jaise vah koi puratathvik mahatv kii cheez bhar ho
 Questioning Modi's leadership ability, Kulkarni says that there is no evidence that Narendra Modi can take everyone along in his own state
 aise main unase gathbandhan sanbhaalane kii ummid kaise kii ja sakati he
 The target of the Sangh was also well known
 The role of the Sangh in the Advani episode was well known
 sangh ada to bujurg kii naaraazgi ko taak par rakhkar modi ke naam kaa elaan goa main kar diya gaya
 Then the elders were angry, then the Sangh settled the case
 aise main adwani khemaa sangh se bhi khaar khaae baitha he
 Kulkarni writes that in the name of advancing second generation leaders, the Sangh created a game to disarm those who set up the party
 rajnath ko khari-kharimodi or sangh ke baad kulkarni ne party mukhiya ko bhi nahin bakhsha
 He said that Rajnath is in the lurch of telling an astrologer that one day he will become the Prime Minister of the country
 isi ke liye vah apni siyaasi chaalen chal rahe hai
 Weakening Advani's place in BJP
 khat ke aakhir main kulkarni likhte hai ki bijepi kaa kshay shuru ho chukaa he
 If Advani continues to be humiliated in the same way, forced into rebellion or renunciation, the party will end even faster

 14 karod se adhik ladakiyon or auraton ko vikrut kar diya jaataa he
 But the way girls are kept away from education in Pakistan, we have to meet these challenges with the help of each other and together for the next generation
 main unki bahan kii tarah hum or main unke saath hum

 khatna main mahilaon ke jananaangon ke clitoris (clitoris) kaa hissaa kaat diya jaataa he

 The band is melding Kabir's popular verses such as 'chadariya Jhini Re Beeni' 'moko Kahan Khogege Re Bande' and 'man Lago Yaar Fakiri Me' through a fusion of rock and Carnatic music styles
 ramasvami ne kaha, ‘‘ham in chhandon kii buniyadi lay nahin badalenge or uske bol bhi vahi rahenge
 We will only make music around the song
 ham prahlaad singh tipanaya ji ke sangeet kaa anusharan karenge

 The violinist said that classical music is timeless

 The comments unhone bataaya, ‘‘ham kabir yatra main jate hai or har saal gaavon main prastutiyaan dete hai

 Initially it seemed that they were in favor of a managerial solution to the issue, which could be seen as two new initiatives — one when the District Collector of Ahmednagar in Maharashtra took a single window to collect and deal with the applications of the common man
 Secondly, he made an arrangement for redressal of grievances, the basis of which was that one day a week the Collector along with his senior officers would put a tree in the open
 It will face down the common people and will try to solve their problems there
 par jab rajeev gandhi desh ke dur-daraaj ke gramin ilaakon kaa baar-baar daura karne lage to yah jaahir hone laga ki yah koi prabandhkeey nahin, ek vyavasthaagat samaadhaan tha jo ek javabdeh prashasan khadaa karne ke liye jaruri tha
 Years later, he said in front of Parliament, "I accept that at that time we were looking for managerial solutions to solve the irresponsible administrations
 ham samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke rup main prakriyaaon ko saral banane, shikaayat-nivaaran vyavastha, ekal khidki manjuuri, computarikaran or udaartaa kii taraf dekh rahe the
 Moving forward, we felt that managerial solutions will not work

 For this reason, the party has fielded Sanjay Nirupam who fought from Mumbai North in 2014, this time from Mumbai north-west

 ham sab ne kabhi na kabhi apane mata-pita se ek sawaal jarur poocha hoga ki ham paidaa kaise hue the
 In response to this my parents told me the story of a goose who put a pebble in the river
 badale main usase ek baccha nikaalata tha or ‘‘bhagwaan kii marji ke hisaab se tay samay par’’ mata-pita ko saunp detaa tha
 For me this meant breeding for a long time
 aise maamalon par mata-pita ke sankoch se jo batch jaataa, vah kami mumbai ke skool puri kar dete the, jahaan sex shiksha to nahin hi thi, jeev vigyaan ke shikshak bhi bahut jhenpu the
 Sex was a rare subject for serious debates among us friends
 pusi, ji-spot, sex yaa hastmaithun jaise shabd aksar badi chaturaai se latifon main panchaline ke taur par istemaal kiye jate the, jinhen samajhane kaa main naatak karata rahata tha
 i understood at the age of 13 how children are born
 haalanki dilli ke saint steffens college main sab kuch badal gaya
 i got a room in the hostel
 aap main se jo bhi chatravaas main rahe hai, ve yahaan hone vaali raging, gaali-galouj or bhadde majaakon se waakif honge, jahaan har shabd ashleel vyanjanaon kii khuraaq ban jaataa he
 i had never heard such things before
 lihaaja adhiktar maukon par main chup hi rahata tha
 The first time i came to know about sex was when my seniors showed me a video
 ve mujhase kehete the, ‘‘oy bombai ke gujju, tu abhi tak chada hi he?’’ ‘‘tuune hastmaithun bhi nahin kiya?’’ har baar ve mujhase ye sab poochhate or main sharminda ho jaataa
 In the first summer of college, i thought to find out if i was the only person of my kind
 i wanted to know things myself
 iske liye maine ek anaam sex survey shuru kiya
 i got its inspiration from the "confessions Page" (page of self-confessions) of a college blog (SSC Shots) where a couple split up and the girl wrote a post saying sorry
 darasal, usne sex ke dauraan ladke kaa haath palang ke saath hathkadi se baandh diya tha
 The girl said that she enjoyed it by doing so
 lekin sara majaa tab kafoor ho gaya, jab use pataa palaa ki hathkadi kii chaabi gum ho chuki thi
 The problem became bigger because the boy was urinating harder and the girl's parents were about to reach home in some time
 majaburi main ladke ko baaltee main peshaab kerani padi or dedh ghante baad unhen chaabi mili, jab maa-baap pahunchane hi vaale the
 It was only after this that the idea of raising such adventurous sex acts came to my mind
 survey main bahut vastuparak sawaal puche gaye the, lekin apane tajurbon ke bare main vivaran dene ke liye bhi isamen jagah thi
 For example, in response to "how often do you masturbate", one boy wrote in the comment, "I don't count
 ’’meraa dost bhushan mujhe apane anubhav ke bare main bataane vaala pehla vyakti tha
 When he was 14 years old, his sister's friend, who was five years older than him, had initiated sex with her
 phir yah aksar hi hone laga
 He still attributes this early experience to his art of attracting girls
 (abhi vah 21 saal kaa he or 12 ladakiyon ke saath sambandh bana chukaa he)
 One of my classmate Prashanth told how he once had sex 10 times in 24 hours
 ek or classmet jaikab ne bataaya ki jab uskaa kisi ladki ke saath sambandh chal rahaa hota he, us dauraan vah hastmaithun nahin karata kyonki ise vah uske saath dhokhaa maanata he
 Yes, when he is alone, he masturbates three times a day
 tina ne mujhe bataaya ki kaise usne hastmaithun kii koshish kii, lekin naakaam rahi kyonki ‘‘use pataa hi nahin tha ki kya karnaa hota he
 "her best friend told that it sometimes takes a quarter of an hour or more to reach the climax
" ho saktaa he, yahi vajah ho ki ek ladki ne ‘‘hastmaithun ke baad aap kaisaa mahasoos karte hai’’ ke jawaab main likhaa tha, ‘‘kabhi bhi santusht nahin
 "while the other wrote," Fatigue
 ’’ isse yah samaj main aata he ki survey main shaamil 48 main se 29 ladakiyon ne kyon kaha ki unhone kabhi hastmaithun kii koshish hi nahin kii he
 All were not so open though
 kuch ne to badi vinamrata se jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya or kuch or the, jo mujhe chipku samaj rahe the
 Anu refuses to fill the sheet as she is ashamed to think about it
 arjuna ne pehle to inkaar kiya
 Then it was ready and gave the survey after three days
 kuch ne sidhe kah daalaa ki isse mujhe koi matlab nahin hona chahie
 The survey provided a way for Stephens students to communicate about their sex lives
 kuch sawaal is bare main the ki apane mata-pita se ve kitna khule hue hai
 i was surprised to learn that only 10 percent of boys and girls talk to their parents about masturbation
 adhiktar is niti par kaam karte the ki ‘‘na pucho, na bataao’’
 i was surprised to learn that 37 percent of the boys talk to their parents about their relationship and "tell them both"
 ’’ sirf 25 fisadi ladkiyaan mata or pita, donon main vishwaas karti hai or 18 fisadi sirf apni maa se khuli hui hai
 It was interesting to know that the average age of boys to start masturbating in my college was 14 years, while for girls it was 16 years
 iske alaava survey main shaamil 35 ladakon main se sirf ek tha, jisane kaha ki usne kabhi hastmaithun nahin kiya he
 i found that about 50 percent of boys get "satisfaction" after masturbation, compared to only a third of girls feeling so
 is masale par doosraa sarvaadhik lokapriy jawaab ladakiyon kii ore (14 fisadi) se yah tha ki ‘‘jaise maine vakt barabaad kar diya ho
 "now the question arises that how are you after doing this sex survey
" sex jivan ke bare main kiye gaye sawaalon ne hamen kai varjanaaon ke paar jane kaa mauka diya
 We used to laugh, make jokes and talk serious things
 maine to apane philosphy ke professor tak se yah puch daalaa ki unka sex jivan kaisaa he, jiske jawaab main unhone kaha ki sex ek ubaau or duharaav vaala kaam he or ‘‘isaki bajaae ve sona pasand karte hai
 “I found out from the survey that sex is an unnecessary burden and taboo, which we carry in our dialogues
 khaskar vipareet ling ke logon ke sandarbh main
 Just a little effort, some questions and laughter is needed, so that you can eliminate this monster named sex forever

 ' The debate over demonetisation over the last one year dominates the illusion that it will directly affect the black money in the economy
 iske chalate arthvyavastha se kaledhan ko nikaalkar baahar phenkane, samanaantar arthvyavastha ko kuchalane or manilondering ke khilaaf sargical strike ke bade-bade daawey kiye ja rahe hai
 If the Central Government is making efforts to justify its decision on the basis of these claims for one year, in contrast, the opposition's opposition as well as the economic data coming from one year are trying to disprove these claims
 kya kah rahi he sarkaar?notebandi kaa 8 november 2016 ko elaan karne ke baad november maheene main hi lagbhag 5 alag-alag maukon par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne notebandi kaa makasad ginate hue apni baat kahi he
 On 8 November 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that his government is closing the currency of 500 and 1000 rupees to eliminate corruption and black money from the country
 sarkaar kii daleel thi ki is karency kaa anti-naishanal or anti soshal tatv istemaal karne lage the
 a week after his first statement on demonetisation, on 13 November 2016, the Prime Minister again said on demonetisation - i was chosen to fight against black money and corruption and i am doing the same
 ek haftaa or nahin beetaa ki pradhanmantri ne 22 november, 2016 ko kaha ki notebandi bhrashtachar or kaledhan ke khilaaf antim nahin pehali ladaai he
 Then on 25 November 2016, the Prime Minister said that he took the decision of demonetisation to protect the interests of poor and middle class
 piem modi ke mutabik log skool, aspataal or jameen kharidte vakt ghoose dene par majaboor the or unke is faisle ke baad garib aadmi ke saamne yah vivashtaa nahin rahegi kyonki koi bhi unase ghoose lene ke liye taiyaar nahin hoga
 Then at the end of the same month, on 27 November, the Prime Minister said that the people who deposited black money first are using the poor man to bring it back to the system after demonetisation
 kya kah rahaa arthvyavastha kaa siddhant?notebandi ne desh kii tej daudti arthvyavastha kii taang main goli maar di
 Zyan Dreze, a well-known economist and member of the National Advisory Council during the UPA tenure, compared demonetisation, saying that the act is the same as if someone was shot at the wheel of a fast racing car
 zyaan drez ne daawa kiya tha ki sarkaar kaa yah faisla sirf virdohi raajnneetik dalon ke paas maujuud kaledhan ko khatm karne ke liye liya gaya he
 Also read: The Modi government has problems with cash but is on top gear in Japan
 Cash Economy Dreze argued that the sly person with black money knows better ways to keep his black earning cash in a suitcase
 vah apni kaali kamai ko kharch karata he, nivesh karata he or cash ko kisi anya rup main badal letaa he
 He buys property, blows up on expensive weddings, goes shopping in Dubai or spends to please politicians
 haalanki yah bhi satya he ki kisi die samay main kuch kalaadhan uske paas rasoi ke dibbe yaa takiya kii khol main bhi padaa ho
 But the practice of taking out the remaining black money is the same as running a shower in the room
 lihaaja is kadam ko kaledhan ke khilaaf sargical strike kii sangya dena mahaj ek bhram he
 At the same time, Dreuz said that political parties probably do the work of accumulating black money
 unke liye yah taarkik he ki badi maatra main cash ekatrit karen jisase chunaav prachaar ke kaam ko sahaj kiya ja sake
 Therefore, the opposition party was the main target of demonetisation
 aarthik aankadon main notebandinotbandi kii maheenon tak chali kavayad ke baad haal main rigerv bank ne jab khulaasa kiya ki lagbhag puri kii puri pratibandhit karency uske paas jamaa ho chuki he
 This revelation once again made Drez's economic theory in the headlines
 vahiin jis tarah se samay-samay par pradhanmantri samet kendriya mantriyon ne notebandi ke makasad kaa vistaar kiya usase saaf he ki notebandi se 8 november ko di gai pehali daleel galat sabit hui he
 Therefore, within a month of demonetisation, on November 22, it was said that this is only the first step in the fight against black money
 lekin aashcharya is baat par he ki notebandi or uske makasad par haaavee bhram jab tut chukaa he to kyon sarkaar is baat ko maan nahin leti ki iskaa yah faisla galat tha

 In Delhi, there was such a huge gathering on the name of preventing communal forces in power today that the eyes of BJP and Congress have become crooked
 14 dalon ke diggaj netaaon ne talkatoraa stadium se taal thokkar kaha he ki dharm ke dhandhebaazon ko satta main aane se rokane ke liye jo bhi karnaa padegaa karenge
 These included the ruling Samajwadi Party and the Janata Dal United, which held power in the two largest states of the country, UP and Bihar

 pehla to ye ki kya ye tisare morche kii sugabugahat he or doosraa ye ki is jamaavade kii najar main sampradayik koun he? sirf modi, sirf bijepi, sirf congress yaa phir teenon
 Mulayam remembered this by using the statements of those who spoke here on the day of 'mulla' tag

 Nitish said that efforts are being made to disturb communal brotherhood across the country
 lekin ham aisa hone nahin denge
 Is this the foundation for a possible third front? Nitish also caught this question floating in the air and said during his speech that it is being asked repeatedly whether this conference is organized to create a new platform? So far this is not the case
 lekin hamen sochna he ki fasiwad, sampradayikthawaad or aatankwaad kii shaktiyon ko shikast dene ke mudde ke aadhaar par sabhi loktantric shaktiyon ko ekta banani chahie
 For the rest, Nitish could not give a clear message in the current political situation

 ) Rahul Gandhi, the Congress party's national vice president, has pointed to the huge expenditure incurred on bjp's election campaign, alleging that she is spending money from corporate houses in campaigning
 rahul ne amethi main ek chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, ve (bijepi) do-teen corporate gharaanon kii raajnneeti karte hai, jo unhen motaa paisa dete hai
 The big posters, which seem to be cutouts, where does the money for the BJP come from

 But they should be provided facilities only under the rule of law

 Reiterating his claim that this election is being fought between two ideologies, Rahul said, "whereas Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians want to take everyone along, politics of anger is happening on the other side
" unhone kaha, unke (bijepi ke) netaa badi-badi baaten karte hai, aalochana karte he or garibon ko kinare rakhte hai, jabaki ham (congress) ekta or desh ko aage le jane kii baat karte hai
 Rahul said, the difference is that they want to keep atms with us, whereas we want to give atms to the poor
 rahul ne kaha, ve hindu-musalmaan ke bich baantne kii raajnneeti karte hai or unhen aapas main ladate hue dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Unlike us, they want to fight brother to brother
 rahul ne kaha ki haal hi main unhen nai dilli main modi kaa ek poster dekhne ko mila, jisamen mahilaon ko shakti dene kii baat kahi gai he
 In this sequence, he further said, they should understand that women are not powerless, they want respect, which Congress does

 They talk in anger, because they know that Rahul, Soniaji and Priyanka have a heart-to-heart relationship with the people of Amethi, whereas unlike us, their relationship is political

 The Pakistan Cricket Board has been embarrassed over its plan to seek compensation from the BCCI for not honoring the mou for the six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023
 purv adhyaksh shehryaar khan ne pisibi ko ajeeb sthiti main daal diya jab is hafte lahore main unhone media se kaha ki bisisiai ke khilaaf pakistan kaa maamla kamjor he or use muaavja milane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Shaharyar said that the case of Pakistan is weak because there is a rule in the mou that all series between the two countries will depend on the approval of the government
 bisisiai lagaataar kahata rahaa he ki vah tab tak pakistan se nahin khel saktaa jab tak ki uski sarkaar bilatural cricket ke liye sweekruti nahin de detii
 It is to be noted that a few months ago during the tenure of Shaharyar, the Board of Control for PCB had approved the claim of compensation to the ICC Dispute Redressal Committee and asked for $ 70 million as compensation
 shehryaar or sanchaalan mandal ne saath hi maamla ko daayar karne or ladane ke kanoonee kharche ke liye 10 lakh dollars kii raashi ko bhi sweekruti di thi
 Soon after Shaharyar's response in the media, the PCB pressured the former president to change his stance, while current chairman Najam Sethi also tweeted his predecessor's explanation in which he denied that he had ever said against India
 Pakistan's case is weak
 shehryaar ne bayaan jari karke kaha, ‘main apane hawaale se media main aae bayaan ko khaarij karata hum jisamen kaha gaya tha ki bisisiai ke khilaaf pisibi kaa maamla kamjor he
 'shaharyar said,' How can i say such a thing when the fact is that as chairman and after acceptance from the PCBK Governing Board, i approved the preparation of the case on the advice of pcb's lawyer and the uk's eminent QC Those who believed that the PCB case against India is strong
 ’shehryaar ne kaha, ‘media ko mere tippanee ko tod marodakar pesh nahin karnaa chahie or pisibi kii sthiti ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaana chahie
 'but the situation became worse for the PCB when TV channels showed video footage and also put it on social media, with Shaharyar saying that in some cases the pcb's claim for compensation is weak
 shehryaar ne kaha, ‘kyonki (emoyu main) likhaa hua he ki siries donon sarkaron (bharat or pakistan) kii sweekruti se hogi or ve (bisisiai) iskaa hawala de sakate hai or kah sakate hai ki ham nahin aa sakate kyonki hamaari sarkaar hamen enosi nahin de rahi

 The question is whether Urmila Matondkar (urmila Matondkar), who joined the Congress a day before, will be able to repeat the history of actor Govinda? In the year 2004, there was Ram Naik on one side and actor Govinda (govinda) on the other
 tab rajaneta ke kaaryon par abhinayta kii lokapriyata baari padi thi
 Govinda created history by stopping the victory chariot of Ram Naik by about 40 thousand votes
 ab ek baar phir vahi sthiti banati dikh rahi he, bas chehre badal gaye hai
 Ram Naik is replaced by current MP Gopal Shetty, while Govinda is replaced by actress Urmila Matondkar
 to kya phir ek baar itihaas doharaaya ja saktaa he? urmila matondkar abhi is par khulkar kuch bolnaa nahin chaahati hai
 bjp's Gopal Shetty, who defeated Congress's Sanjay Nirupam by a huge margin of four lakh 46 thousand last time, does not consider Urmila Matondkar (urmila Matondkar) as a big challenge in front of him, because Govinda is no longer in the north Mumbai Lok Sabha constituency and In the remaining areas, the number of mlas and corporators of BJP and Shiv Sena is more than ever
 varisht patrkaar or raajnneetik vishleshak vishwanath sachdev kaa kahana he ki us jamaane main ram nik ko haraana vaaki main badi baat thi lekin vah govinda kaa karishma tha
 Defeating the victory is far from over, but it is certain that the one-sided fight so far will be interesting after the actress Urmila Matondkar (urmila Matondkar) is in the fray

 However, Sharad Pawar said that the meeting was only on the issue of promoting agricultural production in the country
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki is silsile main unhone kai rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon se mulaakaat kii thi
 Pawar also spoke about meeting with Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 pavaar ne shanivaar ko thane ke ek stadium main yojit samaaroh ke dauraan saaf kiya ki vah gujarat gaye the or narendra modi se mili bhi the
 Pawar was indirectly referring to recent media reports stating that he had a 'secret' meeting with Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on 17 January
 pavaar ne kaha, kendriya krishi mantri ke taur par mujh par desh main khaadya paidaavaar badhaane or khaadya suraksha kanoon ke kriyanvayan kii jimmedaari he or is kaaran se mujhe kai rajyon kaa daura karnaa hota he
 The Chief Minister met Mamata Banerjee during her visit to West Bengal
 isi tarah odisha main naveen patnayak se, madhyapradesh main shivaraj singh chouhan se or jab ahmedabad gaya, to narendra modi se mila
 He said, however suddenly one day news about my meeting with Modi was published
 mukhyamantriyon ke saath mulaakaat main kya galat he? It is a matter of pride for millions of students looking to build their business and dream of business leadership, to get a management education
 isi baat ne 30 varshiya aakanksha sethi ko bhi bijness administration main masters karne ke liye prerit kiya
 She had spent seven years in journalism
 ve bataati hai, “main hameshaa se academik rujhaan rakhti thi or aage padhuya chaahati thi
 When i was 30 years old, my parents wanted to marry me but i wanted to make a career and spending two years in MBA did not make any sense
 tab maine indian skool of bijness (iesabi, hyderabad) main ek saal ke paathyakram main daakhila lene kaa faisla liya
 “MBA courses are largely aimed at improving the cognitive abilities of students
 takreeban har bade bijness skool main daakhile kaa ek hi rasta hota he, cat kii pariksha paas karnaa or usamen ganit or science se jude gyaan kii vishesh jaanch kii jaati he
 Sethi's example shows how the picture of business schools is slowly changing, where traditionally students with engineering or finance background have been preferred
 sethi ne patrakarita main kariyar ke baad van prrbandhan main degree lekar alag kism kii yogyata hasil kar lee
 Today, business schools and recruitment officers are actually looking for employees with similar skills
 unki yahi koshish rahati he ki alag-alag kshetron or anubhavon se aane vaale logon ko zyada se zyada maukey milen
 In the batch of 700 students Sethi, there were only three people over 30 years of age
 aaj ve mumbai kii ek stritji kansaltent company parthenon main naukari kar rahi hai
 She says, "some companies did not shortlist me during the placement
 aisi companiyaan saamaanya taur par ejiniyaron ko hi apane yahaan rakhti hai
 However, some old companies like Aditya Birla Group took interest in me and i pulled them out till the last round
 ”aaj aap chahen to apni pasand ke kisi bhi institute se kuch lakh rupye kharch kar emb kar sakate hai yaa phir kuch hajaar ru
 i can also earn this degree from the Internet, but remember that the credibility of an institute depends on the faculty there, its curriculum and placement record
 companiyaan best bijness skulon se chaatro ko apane yahaan rakhane kii hode main isiilie lagi rahati hai, kyonki unka apana tajurba hota he ki top institute se aane vaale chaatr vaastavik jindagi kii samasyaon se nibatane ke liye apekshaakrit zyada taiyaar hote hai
 This year, India Today Group and MDRA survey of 269 best business schools in India has revealed that this is the best opportunity to study business management at the moment, especially if you enroll in a good business school
 badlaav ngkshajadagi kaa aisa sach he jo kabhi nahin badalata, lekin kuch institute aise hai jo saal dar saal ranking ke maamle main apni jagah barkaraar rakhe hue hai
 The Indian Institute of management-ahmedabad (IIMA-A) has once again emerged as the best management institute in the country
 2003 se yah institute lagaataar pehle paaydaan par kaayam he
 There are some institutes which are continuously improving their rankings
 inhen main ek he mumbai kaa espi jain institute of management and research jo pichley saal ke mukaable ek paaydaan upar chadhakar 2015 main chauthe sthaan par pahunch gaya he
 The institute was ranked seventh in 2013
 isi tarah gudgaanv kaa management deveopment institute is baar paanchaven number par he jabaki 2014 main yah chathe or 2013 main aathven sthaan par tha
 Some reputed institutions have been omitted from this list because they either did not participate in the survey (IIM Bangalore and IIM Lucknow) or did not submit their data in time
 awwal sansthaanon main ek samaan baat yah pai gai he ki campus placement ke maamle main in sabhi kaa pradarshan badhibia rahaa he
 Apart from traditional employers such as banking and financial sector and consulting, the survey found that not only finance, private equity and venture capital firms are taking students from business schools, but now internet and e-commerce and technology companies are also trending towards these institutes
 Is doing
 sheersh bi-skulon main placement ke aakhri round main is baar flipcart, amejon, olacabs, quikar, snapdil or ubar ahm niyokta the jinhone paramparaagat niyoktaaon ke mukaable 25 fisadi zyada paise die
 Apart from this, work and roles have also expanded in every field
 masalan, internet or i-commers main puraani bhoomikaaon jaise product manager, category manager or acount manager ke alaava ab digital marketing, data analysis, oparations or supplaai chen ke bhi nae raste khul gaye hai
 This time the students who have come out of the institutes have got a big salary
 iiem-e ke chaatro ko milane vaala ausat vetan pichley saal ke vaarshik 18 lakh ru
 20 lakh from Rs
 tak pahunch gaya he
 Some internet and e-commerce companies are then 28–29 lakh
 salanaa ke package kii bhi peshkash kar rahi hai
 Ajit Ranganekar, dean of ISB, Hyderabad, ranked second on our list of one-year degree-awarding MBA institutes, says, "traditional sectors like consulting, finance, FMCG have continued to be appointed but the real boom in the field of e-commerce
 Has been seen from ”iiem-e ke maamle main pichley batch ke chaatro kaa paanchvaan hissaa i-commers ke kshetra main chalaa gaya
 His inspiration has been students like Amit Lakhotia, who is today Vice President (business) at Paytm Company
 lakhotia ne 2007 main jab iiem-e se padhai puri kii, to unke paas chunane ke liye kai vikalp maujuud the lekin unke liye aisa maahaul jaruri tha jahaan vichaaron ko lagu kiya ja sake or ek aisa maahaul banaaya ja sake jahaan logon ke paas maukey pehle se zyada hon
 In this sense, all his efforts and work since his exit from IIMA fall into the category of entrepreneurship
 ve kehete hai, “main unamem se hum jo bananaa chaahate hai, rachana chaahate hai
 For this, you should have freedom and space
 kisi bade institute main yah hasil karnaa mushkil hota he
 "pramath Raj Sinha, one of the founders of ISB, expresses concern that there has not been enough new work in the realm of business schools in India and management education has failed to take off over time
" ve kehete hai, “log niyuktiyaan to kar rahe hai lekin jarurat or uplabdh pratibhaaon ke bich mail kaayam nahin ho sakaa he
 Sinha has started the Vedika Scholars Program, an 18-month-old still full-time residential postgraduate certificate program
 yah course vedika foundation or shri aurbindo centre for arts and communication milakar karaate hai
 It aims to make more and more women a part of management programs
 niyuktiyon ke nazariye se bhi ab badlaav aayaa he
 Earlier traditional interviews and group discussions, now the case studies simulating Geckus have also been included in the process of shortlisting the students

 Arif Parker, executive vice president of the academy, is looking for people with communication and leadership skills, analytical thinking, and solutions to solve problems while appointing him
 ve bataate hai, “aaj ummidavaar kahin zyada jaankaar or saaf soch vaale hote hai
 They are entrepreneurs and aspire for rapid growth
 ” parker bijness skool se apane liye chaatro ko chunane main uske purv chaatro ke network ko bhi sangyaan main lete hai
 Rajkamal Vempati of Axis Bank is also on the lookout for people who have leadership potential and who can work with large teams
 ve kehete hai, “ gyaan ke alaava bhaavnaatmak kshamta or netritv kaushal bhi aane vaale dinon main ahm hoga
 “students in business schools are now choosing more and more new areas where they get good salaries
 aise main paramparaagat kshetron ko ummidavaaron aakarshith karne or apni pratibhaaon ko sanjoe rakhane ke liye nae raste or tareeke khojane honge
 Axis Bank runs a program in which new recruits get to work with the top staff of the institute
 iske liye vahaan ek roteshan pranali lagu he jisamen nae karmchaariyon ko alag-alag kaaryon main baari-baari se lagaaya jaataa he
 The bank has tied up with ISB to give women a role in mid-level leadership
 paramparaagat kshetron ke mukaable nae daur ke kshetron main niyuktiyon kii maang ke kaaran 2013-15 batch main kai skulon main niyuktiyon kii dar record str par pahunch gai thi
 For example, at iim-kolkata, the placement process was completed within two and a half days, whereas in general it takes a wig
 emdii main saare chaatro kii placement teen din main ho gai or haalat yah ho gai ki 60 companiyaan ab bhi bachi thim jinke paas rakhane ko chaatr hi nahin bache the
 Ranjan Banerjee, dean of SP Jain Institute, says, "e-commerce has been a key driver of growth and it will remain the same in the coming days, but in my next phase of growth from Khyal, those areas where technology and finance will sit twenty
 There will be coordination between ” ve mobile wolet, pement bank or laghu vitt bainkon kii misaal dete hai jo aane vaale dinon main acchhee pratibhaaon kii talash main bi-skulon kaa rukh karenge
 It is clear in the new age of Internet-centric businesses that the role of analytics will increase and B-schools are gearing up for this
 top bi-skool elactive paper main bhi badlaav laane kii koshish kar rahe hai

 Does Rahul Gandhi have a personal view of India? Does he feel that some basic work has to be done to make India important in the eyes of its people and make it relevant to the world? If they have such an attitude, they should shape it

 Which mountain does Rahul Gandhi want to climb the country, no one knows till now
 philhal ve aise shaks ke rup main hamaare saamne hai jo pak rahaa he, jiskaa abhi saamne aana baaki he
 But here also a question arises: are they going to be reluctant leaders? The dream leader cannot be confused

 The answer cannot be a mingling of ideas, nor will the flattering idioms of consultants work
 sirf epadi or naregaa iskaa jawaab nahin he
 The answer has to come from within
 ise itnaa mahatvakankshi or preranadai hona hoga jo is ganraajya ko aage le ja sake or samaaj ko haashiye se khinchakar centre main laa sake
 If the society collapses, the state machinery will not survive
 netritv kii pahchaan ek mahaan drushti kaa hona he, lekin sawaal he ki yah kaise tay ho ki vah najariya sahi he yaa nahin? iskaa jawaab koi nahin de saktaa

 The infighting in the Aam Aadmi Party is at its peak
 party ke okhla vidhayak or party kii political afares kamity ke sadsy amanatullah khan ne party ke varisht netaa kumaar vishwaas ke khilaaf morcha kholte hue aarope lagaaya he ki wo party todna or hadapna chaahate hai
 The comments amanatullah khan ne media ko bayaan jari kar kaha ki "kumaar vishvas ji aam aadmi party ko hadapna chaahate hai or todna chaahate hai
 He is calling the mlas in his house and saying that, make me a party convenor or else go to BJP, BJP is ready to give 30 crores to each one, Yogendra Yadav wanted it
 mujhe lagata he ye sab bijepi ke ishaare par ho rahaa he
 They have left 4 mlas for this work
 in chaaron vidhayakon kaa ye kaam he ki wo vidhayakon ko kumaar ji ke ghar le jate hai, aisa mujhase 10 vidhayakon ne bataaya
 On Saturday, a minister's meeting of the four mlas was also held
 ' Let me tell you that earlier there was only speculation whether Arvind Kejriwal could step down as the party's national convenor and Kumar Vishwas could take over as the party's convenor
 lekin aap vidhayak ke kumaar vishwaas par sidhe or bade hamale se party ke bheetar kalah or badhane kii sambhaavna he
 Amanatullah Khan issued a statement to the media saying that "kumar Vishwas Ji wants to usurp and break Aam Aadmi Party"
 wo apane ghar vidhayakon ko bulaakar bulaakar ye kah rahe hai ki mujhe party kaa sanyojak banawaao nahin to bijepi main chalo, bijepi har ek ko 30 karod dene ke liye taiyaar he, aisa hi yogendra yadav ji chaahate the
 i think all this is happening at the behest of BJP
 is kaam ke liye inhone 4 vidhayak chode hue hai
 It is the job of these four mlas to take the mlas to Kumar ji's house, 10 mlas told me this
 shanivaar ko ek mantri ke yahaan chaaron vidhayakon kii meeting bhi hui
 ' aapako bataa den ki isse pehle keval ye atakalein lag rahi thim ki kya arvind kejariwal party ke rashtriya sanyojak ke pad se hat sakate hai or kumaar vishwaas party ke sanyojak kaa pad sambhaal sakate hai
 But a direct and major attack on AAP MLA k Kumar Vishwas is likely to increase discord within the party

 aaj sardaar kaa din he
 Birthday ham sabake sardaar duniya main sabase oonche ho gaye hai
 On his birthday, Sardar has got a new relationship
 duniya kii oonchi pratimaaon kii sohabat mili he
 Now the idols they will compare with are not their idols, with whom and behind whom the chieftain remained the chieftain
 matlab sardaar gandhi or nehru se alag in pratimaaon kii sohabat main bhi khub chamak rahe hai
 From the figure of 3000 crores, Sardar Patel's statue became the highest in the world
 3000 karod sunakar afsos na karen
 Think about when you struggled for school, college or hospital
 kab librari kii maang kii
 Yes, you can say why they were opposed when they were installing statues of Mayawati, Phule, Shahu, Ambedkar in UP
 tab bhrashtachar ke aarope to lage hi, jisaki jaanch kaa aaj tak pataa nahin, magar us dauraan mayawati kii banaai murtiyon kaa khub mazaaq udaaya gaya
 It was said that the hospital should not be an idol
 isliye afsos na karen
 Nobody will say anything
 na zamana bolegaa na zamir bolegaa
 Come to the website of Statue Of Unity, our Sardar is 182 meters high at the forefront
 uske baad 153 meter oonchi he china kii spring temple of buddha
 At number three is the 120 meter tall statue of Ushiku Daibushu of Japan
 chauthe number par he 93 meter oonchi america kii stechu of liberty, jisaki oonchii 93 meter he
 The fifth number is the statue of the Mother Land Calls of 85 meters high form and the sixth number is Christ the Redeemer of Brazil, 38 meters high
 sardaar patel bharat kii raajnneeti ke ek varg main damit ichha ke rup main garh die gaye hai
 Neither Nehru nor Patel is being talked about without the competition of Nehru vs Patel
 ek bade varg ko lagata rahaa ki yadi patel pradhanmantri hote
 Whereas Patel never said that if he were the Prime Minister
 ve khud ko gandhi kaa sipaahi kehete the
 Nehru was considered his leader
 Statue Of Unity kii website par gandhi or nehru kii tasveeron ke bagair sardaar kii duniya badi to ho gai he, lekin akeli bhi ho gai he
 You can say that there is a statue of Sardar in the monuments named after Nehru
 yah sawaal bhi sahi he
 You yourself also heard the Prime Minister's speech
 unhone bahut hi sahajata se apane bhaashan main sardaar ke yogadanon kaa ekikaran apni sarkaar kii yojanaon se kar diya
 Even after this, the Prime Minister said that there should be no politics regarding the statue of Sardar
 unka khud kaa bhaashan raajnneeti se bharaa he yaa vaaki gaiyr raajnneetik bhaashan he, aapako tay karnaa he
 In fact, it is a great injustice with Sardar Patel's legacy that his talk is always in the context of Nehru, while his life was in reference to Gandhi
 unhone kabhi pradhanmantri pad kii daavedaari nahin kii, na hi congress ke adhyaksh pad ke liye gutbazi
 Once he left the practice, Aisho left the rest and left for a lifetime
 nehru or patel donon hi waakif the ki unhen lekar kis tarah kii charchaa hoti he
 In December 1950, Patel had to leave Delhi at the behest of doctors
 chhodane ke pehle patel ne emvi gadgil se kaha ki main ab nahin jiunga
 Make a promise to me gadgil ne haa kaha tab patel ne unka haath apane haath main lekar kaha ki pandit ji se tumhaare jitne bhi matbhed hon, lekin unka saath mat chhodana
 This was Sardar Patel
 rajmohan gandhi ne patel kii jeevani main pej number 532 par yah prasang likhaa he
 On 2 October 1950, he said that Jawaharlal Nehru is our leader
 baapu ne unhen apana uttaradhikari niyukt kiya he
 And they have also announced this
 baapu ke saare sainikon kaa farz he ki ve jawaharlal ji ke adeshon kaa puraa paalan karen
 i am not a disloyal soldier
 main jis sthaan par hum uske bare main mujhe kabhi vichaar bhi nahin aata tha
 i know enough that i am where i was kept
 dilli chhodkar jate hue sardaar patel ne gadgil se kyon kaha ki vaada karo, jawahar ko akelaa mat chhodana
 There were solid differences between the two but mutual respect was also strong
 maniben patel sardaar kii beti thim
 Dahyabhai Patel Vallabhbhai Patel was his son
 sardaar patel ke nidhan ke baad dahyabhai patel congress ke tikat par 1957 or 1962 main loksabhaa kaa chunaav jite
 Maniben was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1952 and 1957 on a Congress ticket and then went to the Rajya Sabha
 maniben ne apatkaal kaa virodh kiya or tab janata party ke tikat par mehsana se 1977 main chunaav jeet gayi
 Shesh Narayan Singh has given this information on his Facebook page
 yah jaankaree dete hue bhi dukh ho rahaa he ki ham itihaas ko kin chashmon se dekhne lage hai
 History is for understanding, not for accounting
 aaj indira gandhi kii punyathithi he
 Indira Gandhi was assassinated on the same day and followed by a massacre with the Sikhs
 ajeeb sa muqabla he
 Somewhere the Sardar is being magnified and somewhere Indira
 hode main likhaa ja rahaa he ki indira ne bhi pakistan ke do tukade kar die
 Did not bow before America
 pradhanmantri modi ne unhen twit ke zarie shradhanjali di he
 There is no mention of the riots of 84 in his tweet
 kaayade se donon pakshon ko maare gaye sikhon ko yaad karnaa chahie tha
 This would have made our politics bigger and not smaller
 kitna acha hota ki rahul gandhi bhi or narendra modi bhi naransahaar main maare gaye sikhon ko yaad karte, raajnneeti ko hinsa se dur rakhane ke liye aaj bhi kehete to pataa chalata ki hamaare netaa hinsa ko lekar baad main kitna acha sochate hai
 In these pictures, you see Congress leaders other than Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi
 rahul gandhi ne indira gandhi ko vyaktigat rup main or rajaneta ke rup main bhi yaad kiya he
 The Congress is accused of never carrying forward Patel's legacy
 congress ko sochna chahie ki us par yah aarope lagane kaa mauka kahaan se aayaa
 It is not that there are no institutions, airports, hospitals, or cities named after Patel
 phir bhi yah jawaab congress ko dena he ki vah patel ko lekar kyon asahaj rahi
 In the last four years, Congress leaders and activists have not been able to defend the outrageous attacks on Nehru
 patel kaa bachaav kya karenge
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted that Sardar Patel was a patriot who fought for freedom, unity and secular India
 steel ke iraade vaale sardaar karunaa se bhare the, ve dil se congressi the, jinhone dharmandhta yaa sampradayakita ko kabhi bardaasht nahin kiya
 i salute this great son of India on his birth anniversary
 isi ke saath rahul kaa ek or twit he ki yah bhi vidambnaa he ki sardaar patel kii pratimaa kaa anaavaran ho rahaa he, lekin unhone jin sansthaanon ko banaaya ve sabhi dhahaae ja rahe hai
 Systematic fragmentation of India's institutions is nothing short of treason
 ekta kii pratimaa to ban gai, lekin aaj vaaki sardaar kii zarurat he
 When our politics goes into the debate of being a Hindu or not, being a real Hindu or being a fake Hindu, then it is time to search for the Sardar who has gone missing
 jo lohe kii tarah sampradayikta ke khilaaf the
 In 1941, when riots broke out in Ahmedabad, Sardar Patel said that what made you suddenly think that you started biting each other
 mujhe dukh is baat kaa he ki hamaari aabru chali gayi
 The name of the city of Ahmedabad was blurred
 kaise mitaayaa jaae ise
 The only way to erase it is to try to ensure that such an environment does not arise in this city again
 2002 main ahambadabad par phir se kalank laga tha
 Shouldn't everyone atone for the 84 and 2002 riots to this day? jab gandhi kii hatya hui tab grahamantri patel hi the
 He then banned the RSS
 balki apane mantralay ke adheen soochnaaon kaa hawala dete hue saaf-saaf kaha ki hatya ke baad sangh ke logon ne mithai banti thi
 On 11 September 1948, he wrote a letter to Patel's RSS sarsanghchalak MS Golwalkar that it is one thing to organize and help Hindus, but to take revenge on the helpless and innocent men, women and children for their suffering is another matter
 iske alaava ye bhi tha ki unke congress virodh ne, wo bhi is kathorta se ki na vyaktitv kaa khyaal, na sabhyataa kaa, na shishtataa kaa, janata main ek prakaar kii bechaini paidaa kar di
 All his speeches were full of communal poison
 hinduon main josh paidaa karnaa va unki raksha ke prabandh karne ke liye aavashwayak na tha ki zehar faile
 The result of this poison was in the end that the country had to bear the sacrifice of Gandhiji's priceless life
 sarkaar va janata kii ratti bhar sahanubhuti aresas ke saath na rahi, balki unke khilaaf ho gai
 The protest was further intensified by the joy expressed by the RSS people on Gandhiji's death and distributed sweets
 in halaat main sarkaar ko aresas ke khilaaf kadam uthaane ke alaava koi or rasta nahin bachaa tha
 People of the village around Sardar Sarovar Dam have raised questions about this statue
 72 gaanv ke logon ne kaha ki 31 aktubar ko pratimaa ke anaavaran ke virodh main upwas rakhenge
 The stove will remain closed
 22 gaanvon ke pradhanon ne pradhanmantri ko patr likhaa he ki yahaan ke jangalon, nadiyon, jalprapaaton, kheton ne sadiyon se hamaara khyaal rakhaa he
 We have been living around them, but now everything is being destroyed
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki yah kisi kii maut par jashn ke samaan he
 We think so only
 ham gaanv vaale bahut dukh ke saath kahana chaahate hai ki ham 31 aktubar ko aapkaa swaagat nahin karenge
 If you come like an uninvited guest, we will not welcome you
 agar sardaar patel ne dekha hota ki kaise prakritik sansadhano ko nasht kiya ja rahaa he, hamaare saath anyaay ho rahaa he to ve ro dete
 While we are raising our voice, your police is taking action
 aap hamaari takalifon ko sunne ke liye taiyaar kyon nahin hai
 But the Prime Minister has said that due to this statue, the tribal people around will get employment
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha ki yahaan ek aisi ekta nursery bane ki yahaan aane vaala tourist apane ghar ekta kaa paudha le jaae or boetippaniyan Now the examination is yours, you, the public
 tourist spot ban gaya he
 So this spot is not free
 aapako bhi ye na lage ki aap sardaar kaa darshan muft main kar rahe hai isliye online tikat kii vyavastha he
 There are two types of tickets
 3 saal ke bacchon ko tikat nahin lagegaa
 It will cost Rs 350 to see Observation Deck view, Valley of Flower, Memorial, Museum & Audio Visual Gallery, SOU site, Sardar Sarovar Dam
 agar aap Observation Deck view, nahin janaa chahenge to uske liye alag se package he
 Adult people will get 60 rupees tickets and children 60 rupees
 bas kaa charge he 30 rupaya
 In the case of tickets too, Sardar's statue has become expensive with many palaces, forts and buildings in India
 mahangi kahana thik nahin hoga, kahana chahie ki tikat ke daam bhi sabase oonche hai
 While the ticket for the Red Fort of Delhi is 35 rupees, the Taj Mahal is 50 rupees
 tajmahal dekhne ke liye har saal 70 se 80 lakh paryatak aate hai, jinamein se 8 lakh videshi paryatak hote hai videshi paryatakon ke liye 1100 rupye kaa tikat he
 The Taj Mahal earns 20 crores
 is samay jab sibiai ke do-do afasar ek duusare par mukadmaa karne ke kaaran daftar se baahar kar die gaye hai, tisare afasar par bhi aarope lag rahe hai, reserve bank of india apni swaittata ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa he, chunaav ayog par bhi sawaal uth ja rahe hai
 The Prime Minister is remembering the steel frame made by Patel
 jo sardaar sabake liye lade, us sardaar ke liye sab lard rahe hai
 Therefore the Sardar was the Sardar, there cannot be a Sardar fighting over him
 Statue Of Unity kii website par aaiye yahaan sabase aage 182 meter oonche hai hamaare sardaar
 Then there is the 153-meter-high Spring Temple of Buddha in China
 tisare number par he 120 meter oonchi japan ke ushiku daibushu kii pratimaa
 At number four is the 93-meter-high Statue of Liberty of America, which has a height of 93 meters
 paanchave number he 85 meter oonchi rup kii di madar land colls kii pratimaa or chathe number 38 meter oonchi brazil ke christ di redimer hai
 Sardar Patel has been a stronghold in a section of India's politics as a repressed will
 nehru banaam patel kii pratispardhaa ke bagair na nehru kii baat ho paa rahi he na patel kii
 a large section kept thinking that if Patel were the Prime Minister
 jabaki patel ne kabhi nahin kaha ki yadi ve pradhanmantri hote
 He called himself a soldier of Gandhi
 nehru ko apana netaa maanate the
 Without Gandhi and Nehru's pictures on the Statue of Unity website, Sardar's world has grown big, but has become lonely as well
 aap kah sakate hai ki nehru ke naam par bane smarakon main kya sardaar kii pratimaa he
 This question is also correct
 aap khud bhi pradhanmantri ke bhaashan sune
 He very easily integrated Sardar's contributions to his government's plans in his speech
 iske baad bhi pradhanmantri ne kaha ki sardaar kii pratimaa ko lekar raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 His own speech is full of politics or really non-political speech, you have to decide
 darasal sardaar patel ke viraasat ke saath yahi badi ninsaphi he ki unki baat hameshaa nehru ke sandarbh main hoti he, jabaki unka jivan gandhi ke sandarbh main tha
 He never claimed the prime minister's post, nor did the factionalism for the post of Congress president
 ek baar jab vakaalat chhod di, aisho aaraam chhod diya to jivan bhar ke liye chhod diya
 Both Nehru and Patel were aware of what kind of discussion they had
 disambar 1950 main doctoron ke kehane par patel ko dilli chhodana pad rahaa tha
 Before leaving Patel told MV Gadgil that i will not live anymore
 mujhase ek vaada karo
 Gadgil said yes, then Patel took his hand in his hand and said that there should be as many differences as you have with Panditji, but do not leave him
 ye the sardaar patel
 Rajmohan Gandhi has written this passage on page number 532 in Patel's biography
 2 aktubar 1950 ko kaha tha ki jawaharlal nehru hi hamaare netaa hai
 Bapu has appointed him as his successor
 or isaki ghoshnaa bhi unhone kii he
 It is the duty of all the soldiers of Bapu to follow the orders of Jawaharlal ji
 main bevafa sipaahi nahin hum
 i never thought about the place i am
 main to itnaa jaanata hum ki mujhe jahaan rakhaa tha main waha hum
 Why did Sardar Patel tell Gadgil while leaving Delhi, promise not to leave Jawahar alone
 donon ke bich thos matbhed the magar aapasi sammaan bhi thos tha
 Maniben Patel was Sardar's daughter
 dahyabhai patel vallabhbhai patel unke bete the
 After the death of Sardar Patel, Dahyabhai Patel won the Lok Sabha elections in 1957 and 1962 on a Congress ticket
 maniben congress ke tikat par 1952 or 1957 main loksabhaa ke liye chuni gayi or phir rajyasabha bhi gayi
 Maniben opposed the Emergency and then won the election from Mehsana in 1977 on a Janata Party ticket
 shesh narayan singh ne apane fasebuk pej par yah jaankaree di he
 It is also sad to give information that through which glasses we have started seeing history
 itihaas samajhane ke liye hota he, hisaab ke liye nahin
 Today is the death anniversary of Indira Gandhi
 isi din indira gandhi kii hatya hui thi or uske baad sikhon ke saath narsanhaar hua tha
 It is a strange match
 kahin sardaar ko bada kiya ja rahaa he to kahin indira ko
 It is being written in the competition that Indira too broke Pakistan into two
 america ke aage nahin jhukin
 Prime Minister Modi has paid tribute to him through a tweet
 unke twit main 84 ke dangon kaa koi zikr nahin he
 Ideally both sides should have remembered the Sikhs who were killed
 isse hamaare raajnneeti badi banati na ki choti ho jaati
 It would have been nice had Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi also remembered the Sikhs who were killed in the carnage, to keep politics away from violence even today, it would have been known how well our leaders think about violence later
 in tasveeron main aap rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi ke alaava anya congressi netaaon ko dekh rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi has remembered Indira Gandhi personally and also as a politician
 congress par aarope lagata he ki usne patel kii viraasat ko kabhi aage nahin kiya
 Congress should think about where the opportunity to accuse him came from
 aisa nahin he ki patel ke naam par santhaan, airport, aspataal, yaa nagar nahin hai
 Still, the answer has to be given to the Congress as to why it remained uneasy about Patel
 pichley chaar saal main congress ke netaa or kaaryakarta nehru par hone vaale anaap shanaap hamalon kaa bhi bachaav nahin kar paae
 What will Patel defend? rahul gandhi ne twit kiya he ki sardaar patel rashtrabhakt the jinhone azaadi, ekta or secular bharat kii ladaai ladi
 Steele's intended chieftain was full of compassion, a heartfelt Congressman who never tolerated fanaticism or communalism
 unki janmashati par bharat ke is mahaan sapoot ko salaam karata hum
 With this, another tweet from Rahul is that it is also ironic that the statue of Sardar Patel is being unveiled, but the institutions he built are all being demolished
 bharat kii sansthaaon kaa vyavasthit rup se khandit kiya janaa deshdoh se kam nahin he
 The image of unity has been created, but today there is a need for Sardar
 jab hamaari raajnneeti hindu hone yaa na hone, asli hindu hone yaa nakli hindu hone kii bahes main chali jaae to yahi vakt he apane bheetar us sardaar ko khojane kaa jo kahin gum ho gaye hai
 Who were against communalism like iron
 1941 main jab ahmedabad main dange bhadak uthe tab sardaar patel ne kaha tha aapako ekaek yah kya soojha ki aap ek-duusare ke gale kaatane lage
 i am sad that our father left
 ahmedabad shahar ke naam par kalank lag gaya
 How to delete it
 ise mitaane kaa ek hi tarika he ki ham is baat kii koshish karen ki dubaara is shahar main aisa vaataavaran paidaa na ho
 In 2002, Ahmadabad was again stained
 kya aaj ke din 84 or 2002 ke dangon ke prati sabhi ko praayshchit nahin karnaa chahie tha
 When Gandhi was assassinated, it was Patel
 unhone tab aresas par pratibandh lagaaya
 Rather, citing information under his ministry, it was clear that the people of the Sangh had distributed sweets after the murder
 11 sitambar 1948 ko patel se aresas ke sarasanghachaalak em es golwalkar ko patr likhaa tha ki hinduon ko sangathit karnaa or unki sahaayta karnaa ek baat he, lekin apni takalifon ke liye besahaara or maasoom purushon, auraton or bacchon se badla lenaa bilkul duusari baat
 Apart from this, it was also that his Congress opposition, that too with the strictness that neither the care of personality, nor of civilization, nor of civility, created a kind of uneasiness in the public
 inke saare bhaashan sampradayik vish se bhare the
 It was not necessary to instill enthusiasm among the Hindus and to manage their defense that poison spread
 is zehar kaa fal ant main yahi hua ki gandhi ji kii amuly jaan kii qurbaani desh ko sahani padi
 The entire sympathy of the government and people was not with the RSS, but against them
 gandhi ji kii mrityu par aresas waalon ne jo harsh prakat kiya or mithai banti, usase yah virodh or bhi bad gaya
 In these circumstances, there was no other way for the government to take steps against the RSS
 is pratimaa ko lekar sardaar sarovar baandh ke aas paas ke gaanv ke logon ne sawaal uthaae hai
 People from 72 villages said that they would observe a fast in protest against the unveiling of the statue on 31 October
 chulhaa band rahegaa
 The heads of 22 villages have written a letter to the Prime Minister that the forests, rivers, waterfalls, fields here have taken care of us for centuries
 ham inhen ke aasare jite rahe hai, lekin ab sab nasht kiya ja rahaa he
 Don't you think it's like celebrating someone's death
 hamen to aisa hi lagata he
 We villagers want to say with great sadness that we will not welcome you on 31 October
 aap bin bulaae mehmaan kii tarah aaenge to ham aapkaa swaagat nahin karenge
 If Sardar Patel had seen how natural resources are being destroyed, injustice is being done to us, he would have cried
 jab ham apni awaz uthaa rahe hai, aapaki police karrwai kar rahi he
 Why are you not ready to listen to our problems? lekin pradhanmantri ne kaha he ki is pratimaa ke kaaran aas paas ke adivasee logon ko rojgaar milegaa
 The Prime Minister also said that such a unity nursery should be built here so that the tourist coming here should take the plant of unity to his home and sow comments
 ab imtahaan aapkaa he, aap yani janata kaa
 Has become a tourist spot
 isliye yah spot muft nahin he
 You also should not feel that you are visiting Sardar for free, so there is a system of online tickets
 do prakaar ke tikat hai
 3-year-olds will not get tickets
 Observation Deck view, Valley of Flower, Memorial, Museum & Audio Visual Gallery, SOU site, Sardar Sarovar Dam dekhne ke liye 350 rupee ke tikat lagenge
 If you do not want to go to Observation Deck view, then there is a separate package for that
 praudh logon ko 60 rupee kaa tikat lagegaa or bacchon ko 60 rupee
 The bus charge is 30 rupees
 tikat ke maamle main bhi sardaar kii pratimaa bharat ke kai mehalon, kilon or imaaraton se mahangi ho gai he
 It would not be right to say expensive, it should be said that ticket prices are also the highest
 jabaki dilli ke laal kile kaa tikat 35 rupaya he, tajmahal kaa 50 rupaya
 Every year 70 to 80 lakh tourists come to see Taj Mahal, out of which 8 lakh are foreign tourists, there is a ticket of 1100 rupees for foreign tourists
 tajmahal se 20 karod kii kamai hoti he
 At the moment when two CBI officers have been thrown out of office for suing each other, the third officer is also facing charges, the Reserve Bank of India is fighting for its autonomy, even on the Election Commission Questions are being raised
 pradhanmantri patel ke banaae hue steel frem ko yaad kar rahe hai
 The warlord who fought for everyone, everyone is fighting for that chieftain
 isliye sardaar sardaar the, unhen lekar ladane vaale sardaar nahin ho sakate hai
 Sardar Patel has been a stronghold in a section of India's politics as a repressed will
 nehru banaam patel kii pratispardhaa ke bagair na nehru kii baat ho paa rahi he na patel kii
