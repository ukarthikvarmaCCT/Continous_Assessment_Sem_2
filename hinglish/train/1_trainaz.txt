 India has always been a religion tolerant country
 dharm or samskruti kii vividhta sadiyon se is desh kii pahchaan rahi he
 In Mughal era, rulers like Akbar adopted a policy of religious tolerance
 mughal badshaah akbar ne hinduon par lagane vaala jajia kar samaapt kar diya tha or sanskrit ke kai granthon kaa farsi bhashaa main anuwaad karaayaa
 Prominent artists and scholars in his court included both Hindus and Muslims
 itihaaskaaron ke mutabik, akbar ne nijee jivan main bhi hindu dharm ke kai taur-tareekon ko apana liya tha
 In his book 'emperors of the Peacock Throne: The Saga of the Great Mughals', Abraham Irali wrote that Akbar's contemporary historian Mullah abd-ul-qadir Badauni (1540 - 1615) wrote that Akbar was attacked by his Hindu king Birbal Was a major influence
 abd-ul-kaadir badayunni ek farsi mul ke bhartiya itihaaskaar evam anuvadak rahe the
 Akbar appointed him to his court as an officer and advisor of the religion of Islam in 1574, where he spent many years of his life
 mullah abdul kaadir badayunni ke anusaar, mughal samraat akbar par birbal kaa bahut prabhaav tha
 Badauni writes with anguish, 'birbal had prepared Emperor Akbar for the worship of Surya and Agni
 'badayunni ke mutabik, birbal ke prabhaav main aakar akbar jal, pathar, ped or sabhi prakritik tatwon kii puja karne lage the
 Even he used to bow down in front of the cow and give special status to cow dung
 'badayunni ne likhaa he, 'birbal ne akbar ko surya kii puja karne ke liye protsaahit kiya
 Birbal argued to Akbar that the sun gives light to all and helps to cook all the fruits, flowers and products of the earth
 surya maanav ko jivit rakhane main madad karata he isliye uski puja kii jaani chahie
 'akbar also gave many guidelines related to food and drink
 akbar ne bif ke seven par pratibandh lagaaya tha
 Badauni has written in his book, 'there was a strong ban on the consumption of beef because the consumption of beef was not considered good for digestion
 'badayunni ke mutabik, ravivaar ke din jeev-jantuon kii hatyaon par bhi kadaa pratibandh lagaaya gaya tha kyonki yah din surya kaa din mana jaataa he
 The famous medieval historian Harbans Mukhiya says that no other ruler has adopted as much Hindu methods as Akbar
 vah har din naa keval surya upasna karte the balki surya ke sanskrit main 1000 naam bhi lete the

 The court ordered that the rest of the seal be opened except for the school record keeping room
 yathasthiti barkaraar rakhi jaae
 Also, the court appointed a local commissioner who would leave the record room and open the rest of the seal
 maamle kii agali sunwaayee somvaar ko hogi
 Significantly, the Delhi government had earlier sent notices to Maxfort Pitampura and Maxfort Rohini after complaints of irregularities in admission to EWS quota
 uske baad jab jawaab santoshjanak nahin laga to techover karne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 The current Kejriwal government in Delhi has been tightening private schools from the beginning
 isse pehle dilli sarkaar ne sarkari jameen par bane nijee skulon ko bina sarkaar kii anumati liye fees nahin badhaane ko majaboor kiya jisko hycourt ne bhi sahi tehraaya tha
 However, the school moved the Delhi High Court against this decision and the court has currently given interim relief to the school
 court ne aadesh diya ki skool ke record rakhane vaale kamare ko chhodkar baaki sil kholi jaae
 The status quo must be maintained

 rajyasabha main teen talaak bill buudhvaar ko pesh hoga or sarkaar is par bahes bhi karaayegi
 Earlier this bill was supposed to come in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, but due to lack of consensus among the opposition parties, the government did not think it appropriate to introduce it on Tuesday
 kya buudhvaar ko teen talaak bill ke kanoon ban paane kaa rasta saaf hoga yaa nahin?, isko lekar abhi bhi suspence bana hua he
 On Tuesday evening, the Business Advisory Committee of the Rajya Sabha met in this regard, but no concrete result was reached
 sarkaar chaahati he ki loksabhaa main jis tarah se yah bill paas hua he, rajyasabha bhi us bill ko bina kisi badlaav ke thik usee tarah paas karvaa de
 It can be sent to the President for signature and it can become law immediately
 rajyasabhaki kaaryamantranaa samiti main sarkaar ne vipakshi partiyon ko bataaya ki yah bill sarkaar kii praathamikta main shaamil he or sarkaar ise har haalat main jaldi se jaldi paas karana chaahati he
 There was no firm assurance from the opposition parties that the government would not pressurize the House to send this bill to the Select Committee or to make some amendments to it
 congress party, samaajawaadee party, diemke samet kai vipakshi dal aise hai jo sidhe sidhe is bill kaa virodh to nahin kar rahe hai, lekin chaahate hai ki is par or vichaar vimarsh karne ke liye ise rajyasabha kii select cameti ke paas bheja jaae
 These opposition parties argue that in this heart, the provision of sending a husband to jail for three years in the state of three divorces is non-essential
 isse maamla sulajhane ke bajaay or zyada ulajh jayega
 Opposition leaders say that it is not right to make civil case a criminal matter, because such a law can also be misused
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki yah behad chota sa kanoon he joki supreme court ke kehane par banaaya ja rahaa he or isamen har sthiti se nipatane ke liye intjaam kiye gaye hai
 According to sources, the government wants to take advantage of the confusion of opposition parties that if they oppose the bill, they will be called anti-women and they will also be accused of being radical
 congress party pehle se hi loksabhaa main bahes ke dauraan baar-baar shahbaano ke maamle kaa zikr hone kii vajah se baikfoot par he or is maamle main zyada adnga nahin lagaana chaahati
 BJP leader Subramanian Swamy clearly said that the government has laddoos in this regard, if the bill is passed then the government will get credit for it and if the opposition parties do not allow this bill to pass then we should expose them Will get a chance
 jaankaron ke mutabik agar sarkaar is bill ko buudhvaar ko paas nahin kara paati he or vipakshi partiyaan is bill ko select cameti ke paas bhejne par jor detii hai to sarkaar ise select cameti main bhejne ke liye taiyaar ho jaaegi
 The government does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, but it is a bill that even if it is not passed, the government will take political advantage and will target those opposing it in the coming elections

 sone ke daamon main baari ijaphe ke chalate jaankaar is baar akshay tritiya jaise tyohaar par bhi sone kii bikri mandi rahane kii ashanka jataa rahe hai
 Gold demand usually increases on the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya
 phir badi sone kii keemvakshay tritiyase thik pehle sone ke daam ek baar phir kaaphi chadh gaye hai
 But these auspicious opportunities and jewelers' offers will still attract customers
 akshay tritiya par sone kii kharid shubh maani jaati he
 This time the question that is putting a question mark is the skyrocketing price of gold
 daam badhane par bhi akshay tritiya par log kharidenge sonise saal kii shuruyaat main kareeb 25 hajaar rupye prati 10 gram ke bhav se bik rahe sone ke daam ab kareeb 20 fisadi bad gaye hai
 Now the price of gold has reached the level of 30 thousand rupees per ten grams
 aisi ashanka he ki daamon main ye teji sone ke graahakon ko akshay tritiya par isse dur rakh sakati he
 But the jewelers are claiming that the prices will not have much impact on the demand for gold of Akshaya Tritiya
 unke mutabik is maukey ko shubh maanane vaale log daam badhane par bhi sona jarur kharidenge
 Special offers on the festival, the same customers also believe that the effect of price rise has been less than the special offer of jewelers on Akshaya Tritiya
 masalan, kai jeweler is maukey parmeking chargeesmen chhot de rahe hai
 Making charges can sometimes be 10% or more of its value depending on the workmanship of the jewelery
 isamen chhot se graahakon ko daamon main kaaphi raahat mil jaati he
 They can buy their favorite metal as a good omen on this auspicious occasion
 kuch graahak maanate hai ki long turm main to sone ke daam badhate hi hai
 So in terms of investment, this opportunity is also good for buying in terms of offers
 pichley kuch saalon mensoneki keemton main kaaphi utaar chadhaav aae hai
 In the last 10 years itself, the price of gold has increased up to 5 times
 aise main sone ke daam main badhat isaki demand ko kam kar sakate hai lekin khatm nahin kar sakate

 bollywood diarector or actorsonakshi sinhake bich twitor par bahes ho gai
 Recently, due to AIB, an FIR was lodged against Deepika Padukone and Alia Bhatt, Mahesh Bhatt said in an interview that Alia was a participant in the show and Alia was also made fun of
 deepika or aalia par hi FIR kyun baaki 3,398 particippents kaa naam kyon nahin shaamil he
 If this action is taken only on well-known personalities, then why the name Sonakshi Sinhaka is not included in it
 jaahir he ek special force(sonakshi ke pita bijepi leader shatrughan sinha kii ore ishaara)
 Due to this statement, Sonakshi posted several comments on Twitter
 sonakshi ne twit kar likhaa, ' mistar mahesh bhatta isse pehle bhi is sho par kuch FIR darj hui thim, dilli or kolkata main, agar main galat nahin hum to unamem meraa naam shaamil he, lekin aalia kaa nahin, jahaan tak mujhe yaad he to mere pita ne unase is bare koi sawaal nahin kiya ki aalia kaa naam kyon nahin he

 Netanyahu has left the struggle for power after failing to form a coalition government in Israel
 iske saath hi netanyahu ke pratidwandi benni gantj ke satta par kabiz hone kaa rasta khul gaya he
 When Netanyahu did not succeed in forming the new government, Israeli President Raven Rivlin said he would now give former Army Chief Benny Gantz a chance to win a majority and form a government
 agar benni gantj sarkaar banane main kaamyaab ho jate hai, to pichley ek dashak se zyada samay baad netanyahu ke alaava isroyal main sarkaar banane vaale wo pehle vyakti ban jaaenge
 Now to form a coalition government in Israel, Benny Gantz will have to muster a majority within 28 days
 haalanki, benni gantj ke liye duusare dalon ke saansadon ko apane paale main laana or bahumat jutanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Let me tell you that no party has got a clear majority in the general election of Israel
 is chunaav main benjamin netanyahu ke netritv vaali dakshinpanthi partiyon ke samooh ko 120 sadasyeey sansad main 55 siten mili hai, jabaki vipakshi partiyon ko kul 57 siton par vijay hasil hui he
 In this election, the Blue and White Party of former Israeli Chief of Army Benny Gantz has won 33 seats, while the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuki Likud Party has to be satisfied with 32 seats
 isroyal ke saansadon ne nai sarkaar ke gathan ke bina nai sansad yani kanesset kii shapath bhi le lee he
 The Israeli public voted for the second time in the elections held on September 17 in five months

 gujarat rajyasabha chunaav ko lekar shankar singh waghela ne kaha ki maine ahamed patel ko vot nahin diya
 There is no point in voting for the Congress
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki mujhe ahamed patel ko vot na dene kaa afsos he
 Earlier, senior leader Shankar Singh Vaghela, who recently quit the Congress, did not clear the cards on Monday for his support for Ahmed Patel in the Rajya Sabha elections
 NDTV ke shrinivasana jain se baatcheet main unhone mana tha ki ahamed patel se unke kaaphi puraane or achche sambandh hai, lekin unako samarthan dene ke sawaal ko waghela taal gaye the
 Although he had made it clear on what to do, he had made up his mind
 padhein:gujarat ke siem vijay rupani bole- gujarat se rajyasabha kii teenon siten ham hi jeetengetippaniyan On the question of whether you will support Ahmed Patel, he said that every voter owns his own vote
 ahamed bhai patel se mere achche sambandh hai, maine unase charchaa kii he
 Therefore, what to do and what not to do is a mutual matter between me and Ahmed Patel
 ye meri nijee soch he, meraa nijee faisalaa he
 Who has to vote, who does not have to vote, it is not a question
 aisa kuch nahin he ki mujhe aakiri vaqt main faisalaa lenaa he
 i have already made up my mind
 ahamed patel ke saath aapke kya sameekaran hai ke sawaal par vah bole- 1977 main jab main janata party ke hisse se loksabhaa saansad chunaa gaya tab ahamed bhai congress se jude hue the
 Since then we are good friends
 main unke ghar bhi aayaa-jaaya karata tha
 Even today our relationship is very good
 aaj subah bhi hamane phone par charchaa kii
 Tomorrow he will call me
 8 tarikh ke baad bhi ham ek-duusare se milenge
 Therefore there is no problem
 hamaara rishta raajnneetik dal se alag he

 kya aap ahamed patel kaa samarthan karenge ke sawaal par unhone kaha tha ki har voter apane khud ke vot kaa maalik hota he
 i have good relations with Ahmed Bhai Patel, i have discussed with him
 isliye kya karnaa he or kya nahin karnaa he ye mere or ahamed patel kaa aapasi maamla he
 This is my personal thinking, my personal decision
 kise vot karnaa he, kise nahin karnaa he ye koi sawaal nahin he
 It is not that i have to take a decision in the last moment
 maine pehle hi apana man bana liya he
 On the question of what are your equations with Ahmed Patel, he said - In 1977, when i was elected as Lok Sabha MP from the part of Janata Party, Ahmed Bhai was associated with Congress
 tab se hi ham achche dost hai
 i used to visit his house too
 aaj bhi hamaare sambandh bahut achche hai
 This morning we also discussed on the phone

 Has the Modi government prepared a magnificent four-lane road for the Chardham visit? This is exactly what is being claimed through a picture on social media at the moment
 india today anti phek news room (AFWA) ne apni padtaal main paaya ki yah daawa saraasar galat he
 The magnificent road that is being described as the road to Chardham is not a picture of India but of Morocco
 16 april ko raghav varshney naam ke ek fasebuk yuzar ne isphoto ko share kiyajismen ek aisi shandaar sadak dikh rahi he, jisamen ek taraf pahaad or duusari taraf pani kaa kinaaraa dikhaai de rahaa he
 This photo archive can be viewed here
 viral photo ke capshan main likhaa gaya "switzraland nahin balki hindustan ke uttarakhand main chardhaam yatra karne ke liye banaaya four len maarg he, sach hi to he, modi ne kiya hi kya he"
 By the time the news was written on Facebook, this photo has been shared by more than 1100 people and 250 people have also commented on it
 share kii gai tasveerphoto ko dekh kar pehali hi najar main shaq hota he ki ye chardhaam kii sadak nahin ho sakati kyonki sadak ke kinare samudr jaisaa kinaaraa dikh rahaa he
 It can also be seen in the photo that all the vehicles on this road are running on the right side of the road, whereas in India, the vehicles are moving on the left side
 google reverse image search main hamane dekha ki hoobahoo isi photo ko, jisamen neeche baayin taraf Gharbaoui kaa naam likhaa he, tamaam logon ne agal agal tarah ke istemaal kiya he
 We found this photo on Facebook and twitter of many people who are from Morocco, the country of North Africa
 reverse search ke madhyam se hamempinterestpar ek photo mili jisamen daawa kiya gaya ki yah photo morokko ke shahar tangier kii he
 We then watched the satellite footage of the city of Tangier on Google Earth Pro and we reached the exact same looking road
 map main or viral photo main dikh rahi sadak ke lagbhag sabhi chinh mail kha rahe hai
 Like turning, pavement, stone, shadow of street light, everything is visible as photos
 mashhoor travel website Tripadvisor par tangier ilaake kii tasviren khojane par hamen maaloom chalaa ki yah photo isi sadak kii he
 This photo was uploaded on tripadvisor this month by a user named "tangier Trips"
 chaar dham sadak maarg project ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 2016 main launch kiya tha
 In 2018, it was flagged off by the National Green Tribunal
 lekinproject ke vivaranse pataa chalata he ki in sadakon kaa nirmaan do len main hi hoga chaar len main nahin
 On the basis of these facts, it can be said that it is completely wrong to describe this road as Chardham
 radhika apte ek baar phir apni behtareen adaakaari se saji film pedman main najar aane vaali hai
 In this film, she will play Akshay Kumar's wife
 haal hi main radhika se is film ke pramotion ke dauraan periods se jude apane anubhav ko share kiya
 He told that when i had periods for the first time, my mother gave a party at home and the family gave a wristwatch
 pagale hero akshay kii pedman kaa pehla gaanaa out, arijit kii romantic aawajradhika se is bare main bhi sawaal kiye gaye ki log is vishay par aaj bhi baat nahin karte hai
 He told that most of the people in his house are doctors and she comes from the doctor family
 isliye vahaan us tarah kaa maahaul nahin tha
 There was nothing like not talking about it in our house
 sainitory napkin baantate dikhe superhiro akshay kumarais event main maujuud akshay kumaar ne kaha he ki ham koshish karenge ki jis tareeke se toilet film ko hamane aamajan tak pahunchaaya he, ise doordarshan par bhi dikhaaya jaae
 We will also try to make films that make society aware
 akshay ne bataaya ki maine sarkaar ke tamaam mantriyon se bhi baat bhi kii he, film ko gaanv main or aise doordaraj ke ilaakon main pahunchaaya jaae jahaan par logon ko in sab vishyon par baat karne main shankaa hoti he or khulkar baat nahin karte hai
 The trailer of 'padman', inspired by the life of Arunachalam Muruganatham, made on the real life story, was also well liked by the people
 trailor kii shuruyaat amitabh bachchan ke aawaaj se hoti he, jisamen wo kehete sunai dete hai ki america ke paas superman he, bitman he, spiderman he, lekin india ke paas pedman he
 The film stars Akshay Kumar, Radhika Apte and Sonam Kapoor in lead roles
 radhika, akshay kii patni bani hai
 In the film, Akshay makes a sanitary napkin making machine, so that sanitary napkins can be provided to the women of the village at a cheap price
 haalanki akshay ke is kaam se unki patni ko sharmindagi mahasoos hoti he
 The villagers also make fun of them
 darasal akshay dekhte hai ki periods main mahilaayein kapadaa yuj karti hai, jisase unhen bimaariyaan hoti hai
 So they start making sanitary napkins for them
 nainital kii naini jhil kaa aakarshan hi aisa he ki sailaani khud-ba-khud yahaan khinche chale aate hai
 He who comes here once wants to come again and again
 ab ye baat duusari he ki naini jhil khud vajood kii ladaai lard rahi he
 Naini Lake has reached the verge of drying up
 garmiyon main nainital shahar main pani kii supplai kaa ekmaatr strot maani jane vaali naini jhil kaa jalastr saamaanya se 18 feet neeche gir gaya he
 This is the alarm bell for both Naini Lake and Nainital
 naini jhil kii aisi haalat se visheshgyon kii chintaa bad gai he
 Geologists are estimating the age of this lake to be only 25 years
 iske baavjood insaan kaa laalach kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa
 Environmentalists attribute the plight of the Naini lake to indiscriminate construction around it, felling of trees, bridging the water area with concrete and climate change
 jhil ke teen or sthit pahadiyon ke hare-bhare jangal pichhali aadhi shatabdi main cement kii imaaraton main tabdeel ho gaye hai
 The main reason for the drying up of Naini Lake is the covering of its subsidiary lake 'drought Tal' with houses
 naini jhil ko saal bhar main 40% pani sookhaa taal se hi miltaa tha
 But ignoring the importance of dry water, it has dried up for Naini Lake as per its name
 sookhaatalek wetland he
 The specialty of which is to be filled during the rainy days and remain marshy during the rest of the days
 yahaan se ris-ris kar pani naini jhil main pahunchataa tha
 But now with the drought pool being covered with houses, the dumpyard of government departments is more visible
 unnisvin shatabdi main naini jhil ke jalaagam kshetra main 321 jal sroton ke milane ke saboot bataae jate hai
 Water used to reach Naini Lake from here
 lekin kancreet ke jangal har taraf ug aane se zyaadaatar jal strot suukh gaye hai
 It is believed that now 10 percent water source is not left
 angrejon ke viksit naale jhil main pani kii jagah ab malba laane kaa kaam karte hai
 One reason for the water level of Naini Lake falling down is the absence of rain in the winter season for the last two years
 jalastr lagaataar girane se jhil main tile ban gaye hai
 The Public Works Department (PWD) is carrying out silt from the lake
 lekin jis tarah jhil ko richarge karne vaale prakritik strot sookhte ja rahe hai, agar unke sangrakshan ke liye koi pahal nahin hoti to naini jhil ke halaat nahin sudhaare ja sakate
 Also, as the population of Nainital is increasing every day, there is pressure from the tourists, in that case Naini Lake can maintain a single source of water for the entire city and how many years it can survive
 naini jhil or nainital shahar ko agar bachaaya janaa he to kathor kadam uthaanaa nihaayat jaruri he
 Rationing of water as soon as the monsoon ends is also a solution
 aisa pehle se hi kiya jaataa to naini jhil kaa jalastr itnaa nahin girtaa
 Khushi from Nainijil makes Nainital different from other hill stations
 naini jhil aaj khud khatre main he to nainital ke vajood par bhi sawalia nishaan laganaa tay he
 Over 1400 Sikhs from India arrived in Lahore on Wednesday to celebrate Baisakhi at Gurdwara Hasal Abdal in Rawalpindi district in Pakistan's Punjab province

 ) On the one hand, in the hospital of Lucknow, the victim of the Unnao rape case is fighting the death
 to vahiin duusari taraf use insaaf dilaane kii is jang main uske saare madadgaar baari-baari bichhadte ja rahe hai
 On 28 July, while going to Rae Bareli, the relatives of the victim who was killed in the accident and the witnesses in the case were cremated
 insaaf kii is ladaai main peedita ab aahista-aahista akeli padati ja rahi he
 The funeral is taking place in this village of Unnao
 kanoon kaa, insaaf kaa, maryaada kaa, haq or hakuk kaa
 Do not look at those pictures
 kroonki in tasveeron ko nazarandaaj karne kaa matlab he ki aisi hi tasveeron se kisi din aapkaa, hamaara or aapke-hamaare jaisaa kisi bhi hindustani kaa saamana ho saktaa he
 By the way, this is the last farewell of a very common woman
 lekin us mahila kaa rishta us bitiyaa he jisaki izzat ko isi unnav kii dharti par dharashayi kar diya gaya
 Yes, the aunt of the victim of the Unnao rape case was cremated on Wednesday
 usee chachee kaa jo peedita ke saath sadak haadase main buree tarah jakhmi ho gai thi or doctoron kii lagaataar koshishon ke baad jinda nahin batch saki
 One of the victim's assistants in the Unnao rape case has been silenced
 peedita kii chachee insaaf kii jang main puri takat se uske saath khadi thi
 a few kilometers away from Rae Bareli, the car was shattered by a truck with soot paint plate and the victim's aunt was also there
 pita nahin rahe, chachee chali gai
 Uncle is also in jail
 kanoonee prakriya ke baad chachaa ko antim sanskaar ke liye gaanv le jaaya gaya
 This case is so serious and so complicated that the DM himself had to come to jail with a few hours bail papers
 peedita ke chachaa ko behad kadi suraksha main gaanv le jaaya gaya
 It is the misfortune of that family that he is confronted by a powerful person, whose biggest and all-powerful party in the country is not able to put his hand on it
 agar is cese main unnav ke bijepi vidhayak kuldeep senger kaa naam naa uchhla hota to kam se kam ek sadsy ke asamyik nidhan par parivaar waalon ko matam kaa mauka mila hota
 But see from Lucknow to Unnao, there is only and only security circle with this family
 shubhachintakon se dur ye parivaar apane gam or apni badanasibi se khud jujh rahaa he
 Unnao rape case is a test case
 us system ke liye jahaan rape kii shikaar ek beti insaaf ke liye dar-dar kii thokaren khaane ke baad aaj isiu main maut ke saamne khadi he
 If he succumbs, then trust in law and justice system will also suffocate
 police kii maujuudagi main bhi milti thi dhamkiyanunnav se raibareli ke raste main beeti 28 july ko hua accident saazish tha yaa haadasa iskaa khulaasa us sisiviti kii footage se ho saktaa he
 Which is a toll plaza just 8 km from mouka-e-vardat
 accident se pehle peedita kii maaruti car is toll se guzari thi
 The team of the incident traced the footage of this CCTV on toll
 jisamen peedita kii car toll se guzarate hue saaf nazar aa rahi he
 These pictures are of the CCTV camera on the same toll plaza
 peedita ke parijan bataate hai ki kabhi sharaab ke nashe main, to kabhi hathiyaaron ke saath
 So at the behest of a dozen goons BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar, every day used to come to the rape victim's house
 use dhamkaate the
 Threatened to kill the family
 or chale jate the
 Moreover, even after the mobile camera was turned on, their hooliganism did not end
 fark bas itnaa rah jaataa ki tab ye peedita ko apni bahan kehane lagate the
 In one such video, it can be seen that a man wearing a blue t-shirt drunk in alcohol had come to threaten the victim
 magar jab peedita ne mobile kaa camera on kar diya to isane apni tone hi badal di
 While threatening, the victim started telling her sister and her family as her family
 magar tab bhi ye dhamkaane vaale andaaz main ye kahata hua chalaa gaya ki aaenge hameshaa aaenge
 Life is family
 to main aauungaa
 It is said that no such day has passed in the last one year when these goons of Kuldeep Sengar did not threaten the rape victim or his family members
 tang aakar rape peedita ne 365 din main 35 baar police or prashasan se likhit main ye guzarish kii
 Feared saboot pesh kiye ki bijepi vidhayak kuldeep senger ke logon se use or uske khandaan waalon ko jaan kaa khatra he
 But instead of taking action on the mla's people, the UP police and law ignored him
 365 din, 35 likhit shikaayatein, laaparvaah pulisasaal ke har dasven din unnav kii gang rape peedita yaa uskaa parivaar police ke saamne gidgadaata rahaa
 Repeatedly begging for help
 magar unnav police or prashasan par satta kaa khauf is kadar tari tha ki use is abhaagi kii faryaad sunai hi nahin di

 wo rape peedita ko dhamkaane se baaj nahin aae or police likhit shikaayat ke baavjood un par karrwai karne ko raji nahin hui
 All this was happening when the gang rape victim of Unnao got not one or two but ten security personnel
 unnav police ko 365 din main di gai peedita kii 35 likhit shikayaton main se ek par bhi karrwai kar lee hoti to shaayad aaj peedita kii chachee or mausi jinda hote
 And she herself would not have been fighting the war of life and death

 And they were keeping the hooligans of Kuldeep Sengar silent
 ab to peedita ke parivaar ke bache baaki sadasyon ko bhi ashanka he ki aaropee bijepi vidhayak kuldeep singh senger unhen bhi nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 The case caught fire after the accident

 We have seen the depiction of the agony of tribals in the poems of Nirmala Putul and Anuj Lugun in Hindi
 isi kram main chhattisgarh ke jashpur jile ke menderbahaar gaanv kii kavyitri anna maadhuri tirki kaa pehla kavita sangrah sonajori ke tat se kavita ke sukomal colorav ke bich kuch chubhane vaale sawaalon ke saath aayaa he
 This poetess of Oraon family calls her poems the melody of sorrow
 in kavitaaon ke jariye uskaa makasad apane janapad ko vaani dena he
 Through Sonajori, Tirkey has introduced the result of globalization, the deception and temptations that have entered life
 aalochak lakshmi narayan payodhi ne bhoomika main thik hi likhaa he ki ''in kavitaaon main potong, bemata, naur, mahua, jatangi jaise asankhya theth aanchalik shabd fishan kii tarah jade nahin gaye hai, ye apane puure vyaktitv, dhaj, dhak or arthvatta ke saath kavita kii takat ban kar aae hai
 "we often read poems of well-known poets, but sometimes the freshness and newness found in the poems of new poets is different
" pehali hi kavita sonajori ke tat se main tirki kahati hai: ab sonajori ke keshon main jatangi ke phool nahin khilte, uski chaati par sagaun ke van rope die gaye hai
 In the poem Mango Tree, Bemata and Child, the poet has closely felt the relationship between the tree and man: not remembering the tree / who sowed / in the womb of the earth / its seed / who watered with affectionate water / who gave manure / since the senses Handled / found himself alone / Ever since the blossom came in the branches / found people fighting for him / her
 yah he tirki kaa saghan nirikshan
 Similarly, in the name of development in Hukudpump (nal), the doors of all the prosperous sarpanch are seen
 par is kavita kii ajjipao (budhi daadi) jaanati he ki agle chunaav main sab hisaab baraabar ho jayega
 His only wish is that this Hukadpump should be placed in the middle of the village, which / everyone can put / hand / whose handle / move / if not just / spit
 
 
 / munh se ugale / pani / or / gaanv ko kare / nihaal
 Poetry is worried about when spring will come in this Mahavan of humanity? She creates a new definition of beauty in these poems
 use pile daheliya kaa aakarshan baandh letaa he, to dhoop main sinki chamakili dehen bhi, basharte, shram kii lunai kii parakh hamamen ho
 But the way the conspiracies are going on to crush the dreams, she says: Wishes would not have arisen / if it was known / the consequences would be so terrible
 vah prachlit varnmaala se baahar nikal kar kahati he: mujhe padhaao varnmaala kuch aisi / meri jaani-pahachaani yani 'e for appal’ nahin, kyonki na to use janaa-pahachaanaa he, na uske swaad se parichay he
 Do not even tap with 'N' but teach 'nadi' because the river is close to my understanding
 maa par yahaan kai kavitaayen hai pyaar, samvednaa or uski vishalhridayata ke liye kritagyata gyaapit karti huin
 There are also poems filled with anecdotes, also of destiny and acceptance of truth - but by reading the entire collection, there is often an interview of sad life-music composed in folk life
 tirki kaa yah pehla sangrah he, bhale hi siddh yuva kaviyon se thodaa kamatar kintu jisaki kavita main aatma ke us svachh talaghar ke darshan hote hai, jahaan janajaatiy samvednaa kii sachaai saans leti he
 There are so many types of trees and flora mentioned in it, which shows that Anna has watered her senses not from urban life, from the moisture and climate of the 'banks of Sonjori'

 If politics becomes clear, we will not be needed
 chunavi haar ke baad kya aap ke netaa baukhala gaye hai?party ke andar sawaal hameshaa uthte rahe hai
 The very next day after coming out of Tihar, i had a meeting of all the volunteers of Delhi

 But nobody thought, their mail would be hacked
 unhone is confidence main likhaa tha ki yah keval mujh tak hi pahonchega
 It was mentioned in Manish's letter that you wanted to be confined to Delhi, but some people put pressure
 haa
 i said that we should not contest Lok Sabha elections
 lekin party ke kai log mere khilaaf ho gaye
 i believed that we should fight in the Lok Sabha only in two or three states within or near Delhi
 isse hi pataa chalata he ki party main sabakuch meraa nahin chalata he
 It is said that you take decisions in a hurry and later regret it
 ham maanate hai ki raajnneeti hamen kam aati he
 Are learning, will learn slowly
 dilli main sarkaar giraane ko lekar pachhtaawaa hota he?hamane sochaa ki lokapal bill paas nahin karvaa paae or kursi par bane rahe to janata kahegi dekho, kejariwal satta kaa laalchee ho gaya
 We thought that the public would be very angry if he did not resign

" kuch-din ke liye vah log mumbai main ruke or kuch din tamilnadu main
 ' duniya main bahut kam log budhiya singh ko jaanate honge
 Budhia Singh, living in the slum of Bhubaneswar, attracted the attention of everyone by completing the 65 km distance from Puri to Bhubaneswar in 2006 in seven hours and two minutes

 Budhia had talent, but regrettably no money
 budhiya ke ghar main kamaane vaali sirf uski maa sukanti singh he
 Budhia's father died many years ago
 tippaniyan Seeing Budhia's talent, Bhubaneswar's judo coach Biranchi Das was training him and keeping Budhi's expenses, but after Biranchi Das was killed in 2008, Budhia's life changed
 ab use doosraa koi training dene ke liye aage nahin aayaa
 As a result, Budhia had to return to her home
 garibi kii vajah se vah kahin acchhee jagah trening nahin le paaya
 Then, given the talent and circumstances of Budhia Singh, the Odisha government trained Budhia by placing her in a Sports Authority of India (SAI) hostel and got her admitted to DAV Public School

 Because of this feat, Budhia Singh's name was recorded in the 'limca Book of Records'
 budhiya ke paas tallent tha, lekin afsos paisa nahin tha
 His mother Sukanti Singh is the only one who earns in Budhia's house
 budhiya ke pitaaji kaa kai saal pehle dehanth ho chukaa he
 The comments budhiya ke tallent ko dekhte hue bhubaneshwar ke judo coach biranchi das use apane paas rakhkar trening de rahe the or budhiya kaa kharchaa uthaa rahe the, lekin 2008 main biranchi das kii hatya ho jane ke baad budhiya kii zindagi badal gai

 The Odisha government used to bear the full expenses of Budhia, but Budhia Singh was not happy with the training being provided at the hostel

 Generally, the government exemption is for the poor and the helpless, but people like the rich and influential have been taking full advantage of these facilities
 ab shaayad vakt badalane laga he or aise sampann log in riyaayaton ko naa kehane kaa saahas dikhaane lage hai
 However, the number of such people is only in the count
 telugana ke mukhyamantri ke chandrashekhar raav bhi aise logon main hai jo sarkari riyaayaton kaa phayda ab tak uthaate rahe hai
 But now Chief Minister Rao has decided not to take subsidy on agriculture
 vah svaichhik taur par har saal 8,000 rupye prati acre se milane vaali chhot chodenge
 This subsidy is to be given to 71 lakh farmers across the state by May this year
 aisa karne vaale vah rajya ke pehle kisaan honge
 Trouble due to debt waiver, agricultural loan burden on banks increased by 23%, 60 thousand crores of people have not left the exemption
 In February, the announcement will be made after issuing new guidelines related to subsidies to farmers
 mukhyamantri raav kaa yah 'tyaag' 'amir kisaanon' jisamen kai mantri bhi shaamil, saansad, vidhayak, iees, ipies, group-1 ke dheron adhikariyon samet kai bade logon ko utsahit karegaa ki wo bhi is tarah kaa 'tyaag' karen
 There is no need for such financial help for these people because such people are only nominal farmers
 aapke bhojan kii thali main khatarnaak jehar, krishi mantralay ne jari kii chetavaneehalanki is par abhi sanshay hi he ki raav kii yah muhim zyada kaamyaab hogi
 The campaign to release LPG gas by the rich people from the central government has completely failed in the state
 telugana rajya main kareeb 90 lakh alpiji gas upabhokta hai, jisamen se mahaj 5 fisadi yani 4
 90 lakh people decided to drop this subsidy
 raav ne hi kisaanon ko di jane vaali aarthik madad rajya ke har tarah ke krishi yogya jameen ke maalikon ko die jane kaa faisla kiya tha, taaki saamaajik yaa aarthik str par jari aniyamitata ko roka ja sake
 6 to the Chief Minister
 8 lakh kii madadmukhyamantri chandrashekhar raav ke paas shahar ke nikat iravelli main kareeb 85 acre kii jameen he, jiske hisaab se har saal unka daawa 6
 8 lakhs is made
 sarkaar ko kharif fasal tak rajya ke sabhi 71 hajaar kisaanon ko madad ke liye 5,600 karod rupye dene hai
 5,000 crore will have to be given to these farmers for the Rabi crop in November
 is tarah se salbhar main rajya ke paas 10 hajaar karod rupye se zyada kaa atirikt bhaar padegaa
 During the 2014 assembly elections, the state government had promised to waive farmers' debt of Rs 17,500 crore, in its 4 years, the state government was able to make this payment in 4 installments to the banks
 ab har saal kisaanon ko di jane vaale 10 hajaar karod kii madad rajya par aarthik boj hi badhayegi
 However, its purpose was to ease the path for the cultivation of weaker farmers
 agar sampann log se ise svaichhik taur par chhodane kii apil karte hai to isse rajya ke khate main har saal 500 karod kii bachat hogi
 According to the 'affluent' agriculture department, 15 per cent of the farmers are in the state of Telangana, 62 per cent of the farmers have 2
 5 acre se bhi kam kii jameen he, jabaki 24 fisadi kisaanon ke paas 2
 5 to 5 acres, 11 percent farmers have 5 to 10 acres and less than 3 percent people have 10 to 25 acres and 0
 88 fisadi logon ke paas 25 acre se zyada kii jameen he
 The Chief Minister assessed on the basis that if a farmer with more than 5 acres of land is seen out of the total 71 lakh farmers in the state, then this number sits close to 15%, who are able to voluntarily give up this help
 haalanki sarkaar ne kaha ki he yah faisla anivaary nahin he, ise svaichhik tareeke se hi kiya ja saktaa he

 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne shuruyaat se hi modi sarkaar kaa dhur virodh karti ai hai
 Now he has also opposed the central government's biggest health plan "ayushman Bharat" so far
 mamata ne elaan kiya he ki pashchim bengal is yojana kaa hissaa nahin hoga
 Bengal will be the first state in the country to do so
 yah pehali baar nahin he jab mamata banerjee ne modi sarkaar ke kisi faisle kaa virodh kiya ho
 Even before this, he has surrounded the government on many big issues
 inamen notebandi, jiesti jaise faisle shaamil hai
 During the note ban of the movement against demonetisation, Mamata Banerjee had opposed the Modi government by walking with opposition leaders across the country
 mamata ne dilli siem arvind kejariwal, rajd pramukh lalu prasad yadav or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath manch saajha kar sarkaar par jamkar waar kiya tha
 Mamta Banerjee, while denouncing the decision of demonetisation, was wrong and directly demanded to withdraw it
 20 november, 2016 ko chetavanee di ki piem teen din ke bheetar is faisle ko waapas len varna ve deshbhar main andolan karengi
 But this threat of Mamta's agitation proved to be lousy as her rallies outside West Bengal did not attract crowds
 iske alaava notebandi kaa ek saal puraa hone par bhi mamata ne twitor par blike profile photo lagaakar virodh darj kiya tha
 Banerjee, who has been fiercely opposed to GST, has criticized GST, calling it 'great Selfish Tax'
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri ne kaha tha ki jiesti kaa prayog logon ko tang karne or desh kii arthvyavastha ko tabah karne ke liye ja rahaa he
 Mamata had also opposed the linking of several schemes with the Aadhaar card by the central government
 unhone kaha tha ki jaise hi aap aadhaar se mobile link karenge unhen (centre sarkaar) sab pataa chal jayega
 What are you eating at home? pati-patni kya baat kar rahe hai
 They will all know '
 haalanki, mamata ko supreme court se is maamle main fatkaar lagi thi
 The court said that how a state government can go against the law made by Parliament

 They used to say that cow protection is being made in the name of cow, now they will decide what to eat
 aapako bataa den ki sirf modi sarkaar ke vakt hi nahin balki manmohan singh sarkaar ke vakt bhi mamata ne centre kaa virodh kiya tha
 During the time of Manmohan Sarkar, Mamata separated from the government while opposing the prices of increasing petrol and diesel
 aapane ab tak mughal samraat jahangir ke mahal ke baahar fariyaadiyon ke liye 'jahangiri ghanta' lage hone ke vishay main padhaa hoga, lekin ab bihar police unke paas aane vaale shikayatakartaaon ke liye bhi aisa hi karegi
 This unique experiment was implemented on the occasion of Republic Day in Darbhanga division of Bihar
 police mahanireekshak arvind pandeya kaa maananaa he ki ab fariyaadiyon ko guhaar lagane ke liye idhar-udhar nahin bhatakana padegaa
 Police officers will be able to hear their complaints soon
 unhone prakshetra ke sabhi police adhikariyon ko apane sarkari awaas ke baahar 'fariyadi ghanti' lagane kaa nirdesh diya he
 Officers who set the bells will range from Inspector of Police to Inspector General of Police
 unhone bataaya ki police adhikshakon ke awaas par tainaat police adhikariyon ke phone number bhi saarvajanik honge
 Significantly, Darbhanga region consists of 10 districts
 in jilon main madhubani, darbhanga, saharsa, samastipur, purniya, katihaar, kishanganj, arriya, supaul or madhepura hai
 Even when Pandey was the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) of Muzaffarpur, such a bell was put in front of his office
 unke is kadam ko kaaphi saraahaa gaya tha
 Pandey said that two Superintendent of Police (ASI) level officers will be posted at the Superintendent of Police Residential Office
 ve adhikari shaam se raatri ke bich aane vaale kisi bhi fariyadi kii shikaayat sun sakenge or uchit karrwai karenge
 He told that as soon as the bell rang outside the officers' residence, the deputed officer in the residential office would go to the complainant and listen to the complaint and take action in the direction of redress

 In winter, green vegetables increase the taste of food
 lekin is saal manjar kuch alag he
 Vegetables are green, but their prices are becoming reddish yellow
 kuch maheene pehle bhi subjiyon kii keemat main betahasha ijapha darj kiya gaya tha
 The experts then attributed the unseasonal rain behind it, but the current inflation cannot be attributed to rain
 30% badi keemtempichley saal ke mukaable is saal subjiyon kii keemton main 30 fisadi se zyada kii badhotaree he
 For example, last year, onion prices were 35 to 40, which is currently 65 to 70 rupees
 aalu 12-15 rupee se badhkar 25 se 30 rupee ho gaya he
 At the same time, tomato prices have increased from 20-30 to 55-65 rupees
 subjiyan bani lagjarisubgiyon kii kharidari kar rahe ek graahak ke anusaar aaj kii taarikh main hari subjiyan khareednaa or khaanaa lagjri ke baraabar he
 Because of the way in which prices of vegetables are increasing, it is clear that a person of normal income cannot afford to include green vegetables in food every day
 notebandi ke baavjood itani mahangi nahin thim subjiyansabji waalon kaa kahana he ki pichley saal notebandi ke baavjood subjiyan sasti thim
 But this year, vegetable prices have risen by more than 30 percent
 kai subjiyon ke daam to sau rupye prati kilogram tak ja pahunch chuki hai
 This is the reason for the increase in prices, the people say that from where the vegetables come, the supply has reduced considerably
 ek vajah ye bhi ki har saal ke mukaable is saal fasal kam hui he
 Especially cabbage and fenugreek crops have reduced
 ghate se bachane ke liye kisaanon ne paidaavaar main kami kar di or kheton main zyaadaatar kapaas uga liya
 Some farmers sold their land due to the debt incurred on them
 aise main jab jaminen kam ho gayi to paidaavaar par bhi iskaa asar hua
 If the demand is more and supply is less then the increase in prices is inevitable

 iske turant baad hi tatkaaleen mukhya chunaav ayukta hari shankar brahma ne yah darj kiya tha ki modi ke pramukh sachiv nripendra mishra ne unhen jaankaree di thi ki saare chunaav ek saath karaae jane ke paksh main ek majboot dharna he
 (in 36 states and union territories) Socio-economic disruptions arise from repeated assembly elections
 sarkari yojanaon ke kriyanvayan main bhi adnga lagata he
 In early 2016, the Law Ministry sought opinion from the Election Commission on the report of the Parliamentary Committee
 phir bhaajapa netaaon ke saath 19 march ko ek baithak main modi ne ek saath chunaav ke iraade ko badi dridhtaapurvak rakhaa tha
 In the normal process, the NDA will have to muster the support of two-thirds of the states to amend the constitution to win this battle, among which are the states where its political opponents are in power
 tabhi vah apane is makasad ko hasil kar sakegi jise tamaam samvidhan visheshgyon samet zyaadaatar aalochak bakawaas bataate hue khaarij kar rahe hai
 Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad says, "except for an extension of one year in the emergency to the Lok Sabha and the state legislatures, Article 172 of any kind of permanent in the electoral system, which does not give more than a day of five years For change, the constitution has to be read and amended
 is badlaav ke saath yah bhi sunishchit karnaa hoga ki vishwaas ke sakaaratmak mat ke bina aap koi avishvaas prastaav na laa saken
 But this will require a lot of political consensus
 " prasad ke mutabik, samvidhan main ek yah sanshodhan bhi apanaaya janaa hoga ki kisi sadan ke paanch saal ke kaarykaal ke bheetar avishvaas prastaav keval ek baar hi laayaa ja sake
 The concerns of the people have increased with the realization that if the BJP wants, the government has another easy way
 vah samvidhan main sanshodhan karaae bagaiyr hi 17 bade rajyon main se 11 rajyon main ''ek raashtra, ek chunaav" kii vyavastha kaa paalan kara sakati he
 For this, the BJP will only have to do the general elections in December 2018, when assembly elections are to be held in three big states - Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
 iske saath hi vah maharashtra or haryana samet bhaajapa shasit kuch anya rajyon se bhi samay se pehle chunaav karaane ko kah sakati he
 If this happens, the Election Commission can automatically exercise its prerogative to announce the first elections in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha, where the assembly elections were held along with the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 party ke bheetar aam dharna yah he ki niyamit antaraal par chunaav aachaar samhita lagane se 45 din tak saare kaam thap ho jate hai
 If during the Lok Sabha elections and elections to the state assemblies, there is a two-day interruption of 45-45 days in every state, then every three years, the functioning of the country comes to a halt
 lihaaja, kyon na ise ise badalakar mahaj ek baar hi 45 din kaa antaraal kar diya jaae
 However, some senior BJP leaders also suggest that the process of coordinating the elections to the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assemblies is done in two phases instead of lump-sum, even if amendment of the Constitution and consensus is ensured
 
 party ke mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey kehete hai, ''ek saath chunaav karaane ke liye jaruri paryaapt police va ardhsainik bal kii vyavastha karnaa asambhav hoga
 "many leaders within the party believe that BJP will benefit from phasing out the process of merging the elections
 karnataka pehla bada rajya hoga jahaan april main chunaav hone hai
 BJP had a good lead in the Lok Sabha elections here and won 17 seats out of 28
 ab vah rajya kii siddharmaiya sarkaar ko satta se hataane kii taak main he
 There are assembly elections in December in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which are BJP strongholds, but there is a possibility of anti-incumbency dominating there
 in rajyon se pichhali baar bhaajapa ke 63 saansad chunakar aae the
 That means about 25 percent of its total strength in the Lok Sabha
 isi ubharate pariprekshya main bhaajapa ek saath chunaav kii vyavastha par jor de rahi he or ise is saal ke ant tak lagu karana chaahati he
 It is expected that at that time all the publicity will remain around Narendra Modi and the states will lose their electoral issues
 isse bhaajapa ko badhat mil jaaegi
 BJP strategists believe that simultaneous elections will also help the party overcome the burden of anti-incumbency in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
 baaki jagahon par achche nattejey mil jaaenge to in rajyon main haar kaa utana mahatv nahin rah jayega kyonki vah ek badi jeet ke darmyaan hogi
 According to analysts, if these assembly elections are held before the Lok Sabha elections, it may be difficult for the BJP in the general elections
 agar in teenon rajyon main disambar main loksabhaa ke bagaiyr vidhansabha chunaav hote hai to gujarat jaisi sthiti utpann ho sakati he or bhaajapa ko uski ichha se kahin kadi chunauti se guzarana hoga
 Gujarat was the home state of the Prime Minister, but in these states no issue like local pride will be left to cash in on
 iske alaava, maujuuda mukhyamantriyon—raman singh, shivaraj singh chouhan or vasundhara raaje sindhiya kii bhoomikaayen va vyaktitv or anya sthaneey muddon ke saamne modi kaa jaadu yaa centre sarkaar kii nitiyon kaa dhol peetna koi kaam nahin aayega
 There is no substitute for BJP in one or several states
 in teenon rajyon main congress se uski sidhi takkar hogi or bhaajapa kii haar congress kaa naitik manobal to badhayegi hi, saath hi vah uske liye anya vipakshi dalon se samarthan lene main bhi madadgaar sabit hogi, khaskar uttar pradesh main, jahaan loksabhaa kii 80 siten hai, jinamein se 73 bhaajapa or uske saathiyon ne beete chunaav main jiti thim
 This will decide the winner of the national election
 chunaav ke samay agar kisi rajya main apni sarkaar ho to hameshaa thodaa phayda hota he
 Therefore, merging the elections and taking the rest of the states to do so is being seen as an all-round victory strategy for the BJP-NDA
 jaahir he ki ek saath chunaav hone se modi ko bhaajapa shasit pradeshon main chunaav prachaar ko khud tak simit rakhane main aasaani hogi or vah rajya sarkaron kii naakaamiyaan chhipaakar bahes is baat kii ore le jaaenge ki aglaa pradhanmantri koun hona chahie
 In the opinion of analysts, Modi can use his superior speech to show himself as a victim and take the impression that only he can save India
 ek saath chunaav karaane kaa ek phayda yah bhi he ki isamen matadaataaon ke apane rajya ke liye alag or centre main sarkaar ke liye alag party ko vot dene kii ashanka kam he
 This is the reason that BJP-NDA will get a lot of benefit by preparing other BJP ruled states to conduct elections and then including all the states in which elections are to be held in the next six months
 ashanka is baat kii he ki pichhali baar jab vaajapeyi sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan bhaajapa ne jald loksabhaa chunaav karaane kii ghoshnaa kii thi, to vah haar gai thi
 Therefore, Congress and other big opposition parties have better reason to oppose this idea
 khaskar congress ke liye saare chunaavon ko ek saath karana adarsh sthiti nahin hogi kyonki uske liye jaruri vittiya sansaadhan jutanaa philhal uski simaaon ke baahar he
 The Congress also sees a bad intention in this
 purv kendriya mantri es
 Jaipal Reddy says, "BJP has always made this offer when it has been in power
" saal 2003 main bhi vah pehali baar yah prastaav laai thi to us samay maine iskaa purajor virodh kiya tha
 This is an attempt to woo the middle class voters but it will not survive the legal challenge
 kisi vidhayak ke kaarykaal ko samay se pehle khatm kar dena jabaki use paanch saal ke liye chunaa gaya he to use court main chunauti di ja sakati he
 This proposal is nonsense
 yah dirghakaal main kisi bhi party ko phayda pahunchane vaala nahin he
 "congress Rajya Sabha member Abhishek Manu Singhvi says," The real trick is hidden in the depth of the matter
 iske liye samvidhan main kiye jane vaale jaruri 10 badlaavon main se saat par aam sahmati kahaan he? kya vidhansabhaon or loksabhaa ke liye tay kaarykaal honge? tamaam hitdharakon se koi raay bhi nahin lee gai
 "former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee says," If the assembly-lok Sabha elections are held, the state and national issues will clash together and the important issues for the state will be ignored or it can be reversed
 samvidhan kii sanrachana isaki gunjaaish nahin detii
 Very few parties will have the ability to spend publicity and raise resources simultaneously for the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 "yah bhi ashanka he ki is vyavastha se kshetreey dal haashie par chale jaaenge
 Director of the Center for Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) Prof
 sanjay kumaar ke mutabik, ''agar chunaav alag-alag honge to usamen kshetreey dalon ke jeetne kii sambhaavna bani rahegi

 The CSDS has studied the elections in 31 states, where Lok Sabha elections were held along with the votes in the legislative assemblies between 1989 and 2014

 According to Sebastian Paul, the move would be absurd and contrary to the ideology of democracy
 vah isaki visangatiyaan ginate hai ki pehla to yah ki koi bhi us sthiti main loksabhaa yaa kisi rajya vidhansabha yaa sarkaar ke kaarykaal kii guarantee nahin de saktaa jahaan kisi ek dal ko shashan karne ke liye saadhaaran bahumat nahin miltaa
 If the government falls in a state and the government at the center remains in power, what will be the future of governance in the state? Then the central government will impose President's rule in the state and postpone the assembly elections till the next general election
 paul kaa kahana he, ''ek chunaav ke vichaar ke peeche darasal bharat main raashtrapati kendrit shashan pranali kii sarkaar laane kii manshaa he jisamen chipa agenda sanghavaad or rajyon kii swaittata ko asthir karne kaa he
 It is an attempt to bring our democracy on ventilator and to disintegrate the core spirit of our Constitution - unity in diversity
 "anya logon kii daleel he ki nae niyamon kii madad se ek saath chunaav karaane kaa yah vichaar avishvaas prastaavon or kaarykaal ke bich main hi centre sarkaar ke gir jane jaisi sthitiyon ke khilaaf suraksha ke taur par kaam karegaa
 This will ensure more stable governance at the national level and there will be a possibility of new political culture to flourish

 Big challenge: Indian general elections are the largest and most extraordinary event management event on earth
 loksabhaa kii 543 siton par lagbhag ek hi samay chunaav karana, jisamen 9
 30 lakh polling stations have to be managed, where 90 crore voters come
 ise duniya main sabase bharosemand chunaav mana jaataa he
 India has more voters than any other country
 saath hi chunaav nishchit rup se sansadhano ke adhiktam upyog kii sambhaavnaaen kholenge lekin jahaan kuch kii jaruraton main jabardast ijapha (sambhawatah dugana yaa usase zyada) hoga, vahiin kuch main anupatik rup se utana ijapha nahin hoga
 The challenges for 2019 are as follows: - The estimated number of voters to vote in 2019 will be 90 crore
 -16 lakh vivipat (voter veriphiable paper audit trail) slip kaa istemaal hoga
 There are 9,30,000 number of voting centers
 -01karod sarkari mulajimon kii jarurat hogi jo bataur chunaav adhikari chunaav kaa supervijan karenge
 Other aspects of simultaneous elections — the end of the electoral cycle, where on average, elections to more than five states are held every year, and because of this, the parties and the electoral machinery are heavily burdened — will keep increasing spending on elections
 chunaav ke liye sarkari karmchaariyon ko baar-baar nahin bhejnaa hoga-suraksha sansadhano / shantipurna chunaav karaane ke liye pulicekarmiyon ke istemaal main kami-kuch hi samay ke liye chunavi aachaar samhita lagu hogi jisase saamaanya sarkari kaamkaaj main baar-baar rukaawat nahin aegi
 While frequent elections bring such hurdles - having a small number of elections also helps to curb corruption and reduces the number of brokers and black money - reduced opportunities to disrupt government processes Jengenuksan - diversity and coalition politics will suffocate while this gives democracy an impetus and it affects the behavior and electoral results of voters - if the Center If there is a majority government, it will neutralize the anti-incumbency in the states and the relationship between the Center and the states will become that of the owner and the customer - the role of the regional parties will decrease - the power of the legislature to evict a government is reduced
 Because no opposition can move a motion of no-confidence unless at that time it has the power to form a new government - this parliamentary system And ignores the spirit of federalism, has compromised the principles of the Constitution

 lashkar-e-taiyaba ke chif hafiz said achaanak phir se surkhiyon main he
 Pakistan has lifted the ban on 10 million US dollar prize Hafiz Saeed and his Lashkar
 or ab chaunkaane vaali khabar ye aa rahi he ki pakistani sena or pakistani khufia agency iesai kii madad se hafiz ne do saal ke andar pakistan main takhta palat kaa puraa blue print taiyaar kar liya he
 Not only this, if Hafiz has made a plan under his plan 20-20, if it is successful then Pakistan will become a threat to the whole world
 kya pakistan main phir takhta palat hoga? kya aatank kaa aakaa piem banane vaala he? 2020 menhafiz saidabanegaa pakistan kaa piem? ye saare sawaal ek report ke baad uth rahe hai
 This sensational disclosure has been made by Oxford University in that report
 sirf teen maheene puraani baat he
 Hafiz Saeed and his let account of terror in Pakistan's general election were not even opened
 zamaanat tak zabt ho gai thi
 In a way, the Pakistani people had completely rejected Hafiz and Ushke Lashkar
 magar is karaari or sharmnaak haar ke baavjood hafiz said ne ek aise blue print taiyaar kiya he
 Due to which he is going to grab the post of Prime Minister of Pakistan in just two years
 chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki is saazish kaa khulaasa koi or nahin balki oxford uniwarsity kii ek report ne kiya he
 Just a week ago, Imran Khan lifted the ban on Hafiz and Hafiz Lashkar
 baqayada hafiz said ne is bare main pakistan kii adaalat ko jaankaree bhi di
 Now the same Hafiz Saeed has been involved in Twenty Twenty intrigue despite the electoral defeat
 hafiz said ke is plan 20-20 kaa puraa khulaasa karun usase pehle aapako bataa duun ki england kii jis oxford uniwarsity ne ye chaukaaney vaala khulaasa kiya he
 a report from the same Oxford University says that more terrorists are flourishing on Pakistan's soil than in Syria
 itnaa hi nahin in aatankwaadiyon kii maujuudagi kii vajah se pakistan maanavtaa ke liye syria se 3 guna zyaada khatarnaak he
 According to this Oxford University report, after two years, Hafiz Saeed will take over Pakistan's power
 or isamen sirf pakistani sena yaa uske aatanki sanghathan nahin balki duniya ke duusare mulk bhi piem kii kursi tak pahunchane ke liye uski seedhee banenge
 What would happen if a prize terrorist would become the Prime Minister of Pakistan
 yakeenan ye kalpana bhi bharat ko asahaj karne vaali he
 Because which India considers responsible for terrorist attack in the country
 or jiske sanghathan ko aatanki sanghathan ghoshit karne ke liye duniyabar main samarthan hasil kar rahaa he
 When he becomes the Prime Minister
 to bharat kii videsh niti kaa kya hoga
 But the question is what is Hafiz's 20-20 plan
 kyonki haalia aam chunaav main use ek seat bhi naseeb nahin hui thi
 The security of all his terrorist operatives was confiscated
 yahaan tak kii uski party ko chunaav ayog ne chunaav bhi ladane nahin diya gaya
 Then what is going to happen in just two years that the Minister of Terror will become the Prime Minister of Pakistan
 kya hafiz said or sena imran khan kii sarkaar kaa takhta palat karne vaali he

 However, Prime Minister Modi did not attend the rally due to the weather

 unhone sirf apni puraani baaten doharaai or logon ke liye nayaa kuch bhi nahin kaha

 film menvidya balanabhi unke saath hi hai
 There is a lot of expectation from this film due to its comparison to 'kahaani'

 The first story in the film is a suspense in a different way as in the film

 congress ne assam or purvottar ke kai anya rajyon ko vishesh adhikaar dene vaale kanoonee praavdhaanon ke paksh main majboot janamat taiyaar karne or bhaajapa ko gherne ke makasad se jansampark abhiyaan shuru karne kaa nirnay liya he
 Through this public relations, it will warn the people of the Northeast that the ruling party of the Center, BJP, can take any step like removing the main provision of 370 from Jammu and Kashmir in the context of Article 371, 'constitutional Defense Arm' of the Northeast
 mukhya vipakshi party kaa kahana he ki amit shah ke bayaan ke baad purvottar ke logon main isko lekar chintaa or dar paidaa ho gaya he ki aakhir grih mantri ko yah safai kyon deni pad rahi he? gat shuukravaar ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke netritv main yahaan purvottar ko lekar hui ucch stareey baithak main yah tay hua ki anuchhed 370 par modi sarkaar ke kadam kii prishthbhumi main purvottar ke rajyon ko vishesh adhikaar dene vaale anuchhedon ke vishay par sidhe janata se sampark kiya jaae or is par janamat taiyaar kiya jaae
 The meeting was attended by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, senior Congress leaders Ahmed Patel, AK Antony and KC Venugopal, state presidents of northeastern states and leaders of the legislature party
 is baithak main shaamil rahe assam pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh ripun bora ne 'pitiai-bhashaa' ko bataaya, 'bhaajapa ne jo (jammu-kashmir main) vishesh darja khatm kiya uskaa kya asar hua he? use mudda banaakar janata ke paas le janaa tay hua he
 'he said,' There is not much difference between 370 and 371
 jammu-kashmir ke logon ko 370 ke tahat vishesh adhikaar mili hue the 
 Similarly, Assam and other states of the Northeast have special protection under 371A, 371B, 371C and some other articles
 yah purvottar ke liye sanvaidhanik raksha kavach he
 Under no circumstances should it be removed
 'bora ne kaha, 'amit shah ko bayaan dene kii jarurat kyon padi? 370 hataane kii maang jarur kuch log kar rahe the lekin desh ke kisi kone se ek bhi aadmi ne 371 ko hataane kii maang nahin kii
 Shah's latest statement has worried the people of the Northeast
 logon main ab yah dar paidaa ho gaya he ki kahin 371 ko na hataa diya jaae
 'he said,' We are starting the work of taking this issue among the public, making them aware of it
 assam main jansampark tatkaal shuru ho rahaa he or duusare rajyo main bhi jald shuru hoga
 In fact, recently, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, while addressing the concerns of the northeastern states, said that special legislation related to the region will not be touched
 gauratlab he ki anuchhed 371, 371 e, 371 bi, 371 si, 371 di, 371 i, 371epa, 371 ji, 371 ech, 371 ai or 371je ke tahat purvottar ke rajyon or desh ke kuch anya pradeshon ko kuch vishesh adhikaar mili hue hai
 For example, Article 371B is for Assam under which the President of India can include members elected from tribal areas of the state for the formation and functions of committees of the State Legislative Assembly
 isi tarah, anuchhed 371 e nagaland ke liye he
 Accordingly, without the approval of the Legislative Assembly of Nagaland, the Parliament cannot legislate in matters of social traditions, traditional rules, laws and justice of Naga people and land of Naga people, connected with the Naga people

 jamshedpur main 1994 se 1996 main espi rahane ke dauraan karmath adhikari ke rup main mashhoor dow
 Ajay Kumar has started his political innings here after a decade and a half
 rajya gathbandhan sarkaar ke mukhiya or bhaajapa ke arjuna munda ke jamshedpur loksabhaa seat khaali karne ke baad yahaan hue up-chunaav main ajay kumaar ne jharkhand vikaas morcha (jhavimo) ke ummidavaar ke taur par ladate hue 1,55,000 maton ke antar se up-chunaav main jeet darj kii he
 Many veterans who stood against him could not even save their bail
 bhaajapa ke haath se yah pratishthit seat to gai hi, uske ummidavaar or party adhyaksh dineshanand goswami kii jamaanat bhi jabt ho gai
 Although the Opposition is calling it a mandate against the state government, the JMM and AJSU are believed to be contesting separate elections due to the defeat of the ruling NDA
 is haar main bhi sabak maujuud he
 The three members of the ruling coalition - BJP, JMM and AJSU - have got more votes than the winner against each other
 munda bhi aisa hi maanate hai, ''logon kii apeksha thi ki sarkaar ke gathbandhan dalon ke sahyogi mil kar chunaav laden kyonki hamaara chunaav purv gathbandhan nahin he, isliye hamane is par jor nahin diya
 If you look at the vote share of the alliance, then we are much more than that
 yah sarkaar ke khilaaf janadesh nahin he
 "something similar happened to the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) candidate Sudhir Mahato, who was in the coalition government
 agar koi party haar main bhi sunahare bhavishya kii sambhaavnaaen dekh rahi he to vah sarkaar main shaamil ageesu he
 Whose candidate Aastik Mahato has got 99,058 more votes than the estimate
 aise main jab kisi ne ajay kumaar kii itane bade antaraal se jeet kii kalpana bhi nahin kii thi, jamshedpur up-chunaav ke nattejey se yah saaf he ki jhavimo or uske adhyaksh babulal marandi aane vaale dinon main jharkhand kii ek badi takat ke taur par ubhar sakate hai
 The BJP has trailed in six of the six assembly segments under the Jamshedpur Lok Sabha
 shahari vidhansabha kshetra jo kabhi bhaajapa ke garh hua karte the, un par ratorat marandi ne kabja kar liya he
 The BJP had also released a controversial tape of the conversation that took place on the day of the election on Ajay Kumar seeking election help from alleged Naxalite leader Samarji
 lekin iskaa bhi koi asar na ho sakaa
 Babulal dug up the land of JMM, considered to be the sole advocate of tribal vote, so that Sudhir Mahato fell on the third position
 haalanki bhaajapa is baat se bhi khud ko tasalli de sakati he ki 2009 ke aam chunaav main arjuna munda ko mili kul vot 3,19,616 kii apeksha ajay kumaar kaa aankada 2,76,582 kuch kam hi he
 The BJP has also argued that Jhavimo's persistent demand for Munda's resignation is irrelevant as it is not the first time that the BJP candidate lost the by-election in the seat left by the Chief Minister
 party ko 2002 main dumka loksabhaa seat ke liye hue up-chunaav main jhamumo pramukh shibu sorain ke haathon shikast jhelni padi thi
 This seat was vacant when Marandi became the Chief Minister
 us samay marandi ne bhaajapa kii up-chunaav main haar par istipha nahin diya tha
 In such a situation, seeking his resignation does not even matter
 apni dhur virdohi bhaajapa kii haar par congress philhal to khush ho sakati he lekin apane sahyogi dal jhavimo ke badhate janaadhar se rajya congress ke netaaon ko yah baat lagbhag samaj aa gai hogi ki marandi aane vaale samay main apni sharton par samjhauta karne se kadam peeche nahin hataayenge
 Already struggling with internal strife, the Congress got so battered in Jamshedpur that its candidate Banna Gupta's car stopped at just 49,137 votes
 kaha ja saktaa he ki jhavimo kii is jeet main jharkhand kii prayek party ke liye kuch na kuch sandesh nihit he
 It is also clear that this has only heightened the ambitions of Jhavimo
 supreme court ne juvenil justise act main badlaav karne se inkaar kar diya he
 The court has said that there is no need to change the existing age limit of a minor, which is currently 18 years
 kya aaropee naaballig ko faansee kii sajaa sunai jaani chahie?apni raay dene ke liye yahaan clic karen
 After the important decision of the Supreme Court, people up to the age of 18 will be considered as minors
 darasal, pichley saal disambar main dilli main chalati bas main ladki se gangrape ke ek aaropee ne khud ko naaballig bataaya tha
 Only after this, there was a demand for a review of the Juvenile Justice Act across the country
 dilli gangrape keeshikar ladki ko ajtak kaa salaam
 The first verdict in this gang-rape case is scheduled on July 25
 is aaropee ke naaballig hone kii vajah se zyada se zyada keval 3 saal kii sajaa ho sakati he
 The minor is the biggest killer! Significantly, after the Delhi gang rape case, the whole country was boiled
 is maamle main naaballig hi sabase bada haivaan mana ja rahaa he

 The one who got up from the land and traveled to the sky of politics, his name is YSR Reddy
 doctor yeduguri sandinti rajasekhar reddy
 People lovingly call him YSR
 wiesar kaa nazariyaa shuru se saafe rahaa
 He became the voice of the poor and the poor, became the true sympathizer of the farmers and after coming to politics he fought for the rights of the common man
 kabhi nahin haare reddijo haar ko bhi haraa de, use wiesar kehete hai
 There can be no other definitive definition of the personality of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YSR Reddy
 saath saal ke rajasekhar reddy manzole kad ke the, lekin vyaktitv main vah oonchai thi, jise paraajay kii lehren kabhi chhu nahin paayin
 That is whether the Congress wins or loses, but Reddy, who contested four to four Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections, always won
 samaaj ke doctor the reddiandhra pradesh ke roilseema jaise pichde ilaake main paidaa hue rajasekhar reddy ne doctorl kii padhai kii or chaar saal tak ek aspataal main kaam bhi kiya
 But soon he became a doctor of society from a human doctor
 31 saal pehle andhra pradesh vidhansabha ke sadsy bane
 After that his political steps always measured the new heights of the floors
 unki jindagi main sabase nirnaayak padaav tab aayaa, jab 14 may 2004 ko andhra pradesh kii bagdor unke haath main ai
 Reddy Rajasekhara Reddy, who won elections every time, stepped into the streets of politics from his student days
 karnataka ke gulberga medical college main padhai ke dauraan ve chaatr sangh ke adhyaksh rahe
 In 1978, he started active politics and entered the electoral arena
 jitani baar lade, utani baar jeet hasil kii
 Was MLA 4 times, Member of Lok Sabha only 4 times
 1980 se 1983 tak unhone andhrapradesh sarkaar ke ahm mantralayon kaa zimmaa sambhala
 He was responsible for the Ministry of Education, Rural Development and Health
 1999 se 2004 tak ve vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa rahe or 14 may 2004 ko ve pehali baar andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri bane
 The charisma of ysr's personality was that in the 2009 general elections, the Congress once again achieved a resounding success in Andhra Pradesh and YSR Reddy again sat on the highest chair in the state
 congress ke kaddavar netaa the reddicongress party main bhi rajasekhar reddy ek majboot commander kii tarah samajhe jate the
 The party twice entrusted him with the responsibility of the Andhra Pradesh unit
 1983 se 1985 tak or fir 1998 se 2000 tak ve andhrapradesh congress ke adhyaksh rahe
 It was not easy to reach the pinnacle of power by struggling on Reddy's road
 jis samay anti ramarao jaise karishmai netaa ne andhra pradesh main congress kaa supada saaf kar diya, us mushkil halaat main pradesh congress kii kaman rajasekhar reddy ko di gayi
 Rajasekhara Reddy made the villages the center of his politics, not the assembly corridors, in the way the Congress started falling prey to the factionalism under the rule of NTR and then Chandrababu Naidu
 paidal chal kar jeeta janata kaa dilpani ke liye tarasane vaale roilseema ilaake kii aawaaj jab satta ke galiyaaron main ansuni kar di gayi, tab apane saare vidhayakon ke saath reddy bhukh hadtaal par baith gayi
 Reddy starved for fourteen days in August 2000 to quench people's thirst
 itnaa hi nahin, 2003 kii tapati garmiyon main raalayasima ke sher ne chandrababu naidu sarkaar kii naakaamiyon ko ujagar karne ke liye soobe ke pichde ilaakon ko apane pairon se naap diya
 The effect of that 1400 km long padyatra was that the public not only handed him the throne of the province after a year but also welcomed him again at the gates of power after five years
 har maukey par khadaa rahane vaale is vinamr rajaneta kaa chalaa janaa logon ko hameshaa khalataa rahegaa
 reddyysr, who lost his life to death, was a man of the land, and raised issues related to the land throughout his life, he never learned to lose from the difficulties
 unke samarthak kaha karte the ki wiesar ke saamne haar khud haar jaati he
 But who just walks in front of death
 har morche par jeetne vaale wiesar reddy, haare to sirf maut se haare

 Separate extra bogies have been installed in 39 up down trains as well as regular trains

 Meaning that even after these efforts, the suffering of common people has not reduced

 The waiting list is so long that it is impossible to be confirmed

 In this meeting, the US will try to force Pakistan to take tough measures against the Taliban fighters in the areas bordering the Afghan border
 iske saath hi pakistan ko afgaan taliban or hakkaani network ke aatankiyon kaa safaya karne ke liye dabaav banaaya jayega
 After this meeting in Pakistan, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval in New Delhi on Wednesday
 is mulaakaat main donon deshon ke bich afghanistan main shanti behaal karne ke liye bharat kii bhoomika par ahm baatcheet hogi
 Significantly, the bilateral relations between India and Afghanistan have been very good
 1990 ke dashak main jab afghanistan main shanti kii kavayad ho rahi thi or taliban sarkaar ne shaamil thi tab bharat kaa afghanistan sarkaar se behad majboot rishta tha
 After the fall of the Taliban government in Afghanistan in 2001, Pakistan has consistently tried to reduce India's influence in Afghanistan by resorting to the Afghan Taliban
 iske baavjood afghanistan main vikaas or shanti ki disha main bharat ne lagaataar afghanistan ko madad pahunchaai he
 Also read: China's 'DNA' is bad, so the 'pok Corridor' should not be approved
 According to sources, India has supplied weapons to help Afghanistan in the fight against terrorism for the last one year
 iske chalate pakistan ko dar he ki kahin ek baar phir dakshin asia main shanti bahaali kii koshishon main bharat ko ahm kirdaar na mil jaae
 According to the writer, this first visit to South Asia is very important for US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who visited afghanistan-pakistan and India
 america main trump sarkaar banane ke baad yah pehla mauka he jab vah apni afpaak niti main kisi bade badlaav kaa sanket de rahi he
 At the same time, there have been reports in the US media of the inclusion of the Taliban in the Afghan government in the US media
 gauratlab he ki aisi kisi pahal se jahaan america yah sunishchit kar sakegaa ki taliban ke saath yuddh viraam jaisi sthiti main vah tatkaal shanti kii pahal kar sake or vahiin pakistan main punap rahe antakawaad par lagaam kas sake
 Why is Modi, Tillerson meeting important? After meeting with the Prime Minister of Pakistan and the Chiefs of the Army, the US Secretary of State will go directly to New Delhi
 america videsh mantralay ke mutabik uski dakshin asia niti main bharat ek mahatvapurn khilaadi he
 However, Pakistan has always been a loyal natural alai of America
 baat sheet yuddh kii ho yaa phir afghanistan se rus kii sena ko khadedane kii, pakistan ne hameshaa america kaa saath diya he
 But relations between the US and Pakistan were soured after decades after the 9–11 attacks, mastermind Osama bin Laden was found in Pakistan
 ise bhi padhein: china ko daraa rahi hai bharat kii ye paanch uplabdhiyanis prakaran se america ko puri tarah saaf ho gaya ki ab use aatankwaad ke safaaye ke liye pakistan se alag hatakar dekhne kii jarurat he
 Therefore, if the US Secretary of State wants to try peace once again by joining the Taliban government in Afghanistan, he will have to ensure that the government of Pakistan does not succeed in thwarting this attempt with the help of Afghan fighters
 isi koshish ke chalate america videsh mantri apni mulaakaat main bharat ko afpaak niti main ek ahm kirdaar adaa karne kaa paksh rakh sakate hai

 Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has appealed to the judiciary to leave a decision on how to run the government
 ravishankar kaa kahana he ki raaj chalaane ke liye or kanoon banane ke liye hi janata sarkaar ko chunati he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a complaining tone that recently it seems that the judiciary's interference in the functioning of the government is increasing
 ravishankar prasad ne rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog kii ore se yojit ek sammelan ko sambodhit kar rahe the, jisamen maanavadhikaar ayog ke pramukh or bharat ke purv mukhya nyaayadhish ech el dattu bhi manch par maujuud the
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that in the Constitution of India, how to run the governance and whose responsibility is very well explained, but with the rights, the Constitution has also fixed the accountability of everyone
 unhone kaha ki nyaaypalika ko manamaane tareeke se banaae gaye kanoon ko radd karne kaa adhikaar he or gadabadi karne vaale rajanetaaon ko sajaa dene kaa adhikaar bhi he
 However, the task of running the rule should be left to those people who have chosen for it because this is also the work of elected governments
 unhone kaha ki shashan karne ke adhikaar ke saath sarkaar kii javabdehi bhi he or use sansad vidhansabha se lekar media ke saamne jawaab dena hota he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the judiciary has an important role in strengthening democracy and he respects it completely
 lekin sabko apana-apana kaam hi karnaa chahie
 During this time, the Law Minister said that he has to say this because in recent times it has been seen that some courts want to take up the work of governance and what is the issue that should be considered
 unhone kaha ki shashan ke saath javabdehi judi hui he or koi bina javabdehi ke shashan karnaa chaahe yah nahin ho saktaa

 Read this article of Kaushik Deka to understand who is Assamese
 bahut aasaan angrezi main he
 Kaushik says that we struggled to be a part of India for the sake of our identity
 varanaa ham bangladesh kaa hissaa hote
 We have fought to be Indian
 ham bhartiya hai or kisi se bhi zyaada bhartiya hai lekin hamaari pahchaan mitegi to astitv mitega
 We do not hate Muslims
 ham nahin chaahate ki assam ke kalakaar adil hossain kaa naam enarasi main aae or unhen baahar nikaal diya jaae
 We are not Hindu in the way that you understand Hinduism
 krodhit brahmaputra tabaahi laata he magar wo pahchaan or parivaar kaa hissaa he
 We are Assamese
 hamane bangladesh se aae logon ko bhi apanaaya he
 But our generosity was not understood
 ham apni asamiya pahchaan nahin ganvaa sakate
 i would like to propose one thing
 agar assam main rah rahe hindu bangladeshi pravaasiyon se unki pahchaan ko khatara he to inhen upi or bihar main basaa diya jaae
 The quarrel will be over in two minutes
 bihar ko purana bengal to nahin mil saktaa kuch achche bengali mil jaaenge
 The generosity of Bihar and UP will also gladly accept it
 grahamantri ko bihar or upi ke mukhyamantriyon se baat kar elaan kar dena chahie
 Since these people have been displaced for a long time, they can also be added to the reservation of weaker economic classes
 isse assam ko apni pahchaan kaa sankat nahin satayega
 The way these two states have supported the citizenship law and register, i think they will also openly welcome Bangladeshi Hindus
 assam bhi shant ho jayega or upi bihar ko doguni kushi milegi
 This work can be done by acquiring land in both the states in a month
 doosraa yah kaanoon bana hi he mazahab kaa khel khilne ke liye
 If the government wanted, it could have given citizenship only under the old rules
 di bhi he
 Not even once did Amit Shah mention the citizenship register in Assam
 jabaki sabhi ko pataa he ki register se baahar ho gaye 19 lakh logon main se adhiktar hindu hai
 Then the BJP in Assam opposed the National Register of Assam
 dobaaraa ginati kii maang kii gai
 Now Amit Shah will implement the register across the country
 aam log chaahe wo hindu hai yaa muslim dastavej khojane main lag jaaenge or yatnaa se guzrenge
 They have played the game by separating one religion from the citizenship law and combining several religions
 agar ve kisi kaa adhikaar nahin le rahe to bataa den ki phir kisi ko adhikaar dene ke liye mazahab kyon jod rahe hai
 Taslima Nasreen wrote shame on the persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh
 unhen vahaan ke kattarpathiyon se batch kar bharat aana padaa
 What would happen if someone stood in favor of the Hindus there yesterday and needed shelter? amit shah kehete hai kii saamaanya niyamon ke tahat aavedan karegaa
 They themselves are saying that Muslims have a separate law for citizenship
 rahi baat hindu va anya paanch dharmon ke utpeedan kii to kya 31
 12
 2014 ke baad unka utpeedan nahin hoga? phir ye tarikh hi kyon daali? iske baad jo aayega use phir kisi kaanoon ke intazaar kii yatnaa se guzaranaa hoga?amit shah ne sadan main sankhya ko lekar koi saaf baat nahin kii
 Before voting on the bill in Rajya Sabha, he said that he did not have the figures
 jaise-jaise naagarikta di jaaegi sankhya kaa pataa chalegaa
 That is, they also do not want to take the name of 14 lakh Bangladeshi Hindus whose name did not appear in the register
 jabaki sab jaanate hai ki naagarikta kaanoon isiilie aayaa
 It is the same thing
 ek dharm kaa naam na lo
 The matter will automatically become majority
 unhen doum darje kii naagarikta kaa ahsaas karakar apamaanit karo
 And keep the majority in the trap of Hindu Muslims constantly
 yah samvidhan hi nahin swatantraaa sangharsh kii aatma par prahaar he
 It must be opposed
