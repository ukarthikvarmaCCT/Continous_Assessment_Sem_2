 Even though the cold is still prevailing in Delhi, the politics has become very hot about the elections
 arvind kejariwal or kiran bedi ne chunaav ko kaaphi dilachasp bana diya he
 Debate did not take place earlier and now the round of allegations has started
 aam aadmi party kaa kiran bedi par aarope he ki vah shuru se hi bijepi kii bhediya thim, anna ke andolan ke samay se hi
 He is accused that Kejri Bedi suggested not to surround Gadkari's house when Kejriwal was planning to encircle the houses of Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Nitin Gadkari in the coal allocation scam in August 2012
 kaha jaataa he ki tabhi se kejariwal or kiran bedi ke bich matbhed shuru ho gaye
 Now Kiran Bedi says that if it was so, why did Kejriwal propose to me to be the Chief Ministerial candidate from the Aam Aadmi Party
 kiran kahati hai ki kejariwal 'khatarnaak' or 'nakaaratmak' soch ke netaa hai
 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party says that if you (kiran Bedi) become the CM candidate of the party returning home, love jihad, fixing girls dress code and donating money as black money, then what opinion did you make? Go 
 
 darasal, jab kiran bedi ne bijepi jwine kiya or jis dhang se us press conference main bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke saath-saath arun jetali bhi shaamil hue or phir aam aadmi party kii shajia ilmi ain, to laga ki maahaul bijepi ke paksh main banataa ja rahaa he
 But when Kiran Bedi first arrived in Krishna Nagar, the workers did not show much enthusiasm
 asal main bijepi kii dikkat yah thi ki unke paas kejariwal ke mukaable cheharaa nahin tha or kejariwal dilli ke dangal ko kejariwal banaam modi karnaa chaahate the
 In such a situation, the BJP thought that the pieces of the fight should be changed
 dilli main bijepi ekajute party nahin rahi
 It was a party consisting of several factions
 ab ek bahari ko siem candidet banaakar bijepi ne in sabhi guton ko naaraaz kar diya or yahi sab gut ab bedi kii lutiyaa dubone ke liye ekajute ho gaye hai
 In view of this, the BJP has prepared a big siege
 70 siton ke liye 70 saansadon or party adhyaksh amit shah ne khud kaman sambhaal lee he
 If a leader is to be believed, the BJP has created such a massive database, which includes the name of each voter, his caste, if he is from outside Delhi, even the name of his village and district
 yadi aap bihar ke kisi jila se hai, to vahaan kaa aapaki jati kaa netaa aapako phone karegaa ki aap bijepi ko vot karen
 You too will think that there is a vote, let's cast it, the district leader received a call
 
 
 vahiin, aam aadmi party apane paramparaagat vot or kejariwal ke karishme ke bharose he
 He feels that the voter will give him a chance
 yahi vajah he ki kejariwal dobaaraa sarkaar na chhodane kaa bharosa logon ko dilaa rahe hai
 The problem with both Kejriwal and Kiran Bedi is that both are not leaders of the nature
 kejariwal thodaa sikh gaye hai, magar kiran bedi ko abhi bahut kuch siikhnaa baaki he
 Right now the Sangh also has to decide how much power it will give to Kiran Bedi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is yet to enter the fray
 aage aane vaale dinon main jab chunavi ghamaasan badhegaa tabhi tasviir saaf hogi, magar shuruaati daur main bijepi thodi nervas dikh rahi he

 agar fasebuk yuj karte hai to aapkaa data fasebuk ke paas he
 If you do not use Facebook and are an internet user, then it is possible that your data will also be with Facebook
 yah thodaa atapata lag saktaa he, lekin yah sach he
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself admitted this
 cambridge analitica data scandle ke maamle main fasebuk ke siio mark jakarberg america congress members ke sawaalon ke liye duusare din hajir hue the
 During this, many sharp questions were asked, one of which was whether Facebook also collects data of users whose account is not on Facebook
 is sawaal ke jawaab main pehle mark jakarberg chup ho gaye phir unhone iskaa uttar na main diya
 a member of Congress asked this question, 'it has been assumed that you also collect data for non-facebook users
 to kya aisi sthiti main koi yujar jiskaa fasebuk acount nahin he wo aisa kuch kar saktaa he jisase fasebuk par uskaa data na jaae?is sawaal ke jawaab main mark jakarberg ne kaha, ‘koi bhi yujar vigyaapan ke liye die jane vaale data par control kar saktaa he or chaahe to opt out bhi kar sakate he chaahe wo hamaari sarvice yuj karata he yaa nahin, lekin logon ko yujar kii public jaankariyaan trek karne se bachaane ke liye hamen ye tab ye jaanane kii jarurat hoti he jab koi lagaataar hamaari sarvice acces karne kii koshish kar rahaa ho’padhein duusare din congress ke saamne in sawaalon ke jawaab die jakarberg ne or inpar sadhi chuppitikhe sawaal ko jari rakhte hue congress member lujaan ne mark jakarberg se aage poocha, ‘aapane kaha har koi apana data control kar saktaa he, lekin aap un yugers kaa bhi data colect kar rahe hai jo fasebuk par he hi nahin, jinhone kabhi aapaki privesi egrement par sin hi nahin kiya he or aap unka bhi data colect kar rahe hai’unhone aage kaha ki aap (fasebuk) un logon fasebuk pej par sin ap karne ke liye kah rahe hai jinka fasebuk pej nahin taaki unka date le saken
 Mark Zuckerberg, in response to the question of collecting non-facebook user data, said, 'we also collect data for users who have not signed up for Facebook for security reasons' Not only that, Mark Zuckberg even went on to reply here It is said that Facebook keeps track of some information of users even when they are logging off Facebook account
 haalanki iske peeche unki daleel ye he ki aisa karne kaa makasad ye jaananaa he ki koun yujar baar baar sarvice acces karne kaa kisi yujar kii jankaree lene ke liye aisa kar rahaa he
 If Facebook does not have an account, how can Facebook collect your data? Obviously the question may have come to your mind that when you have not created an account on Facebook, then how is it collecting your data
 iskaa ek sidhaa jawaab aapako bataa den
 If you are an internet user, then you will be opening many types of websites throughout the day, in most of the websites you will see Facebook's Like and Share button, if you clicked it, then understand that Facebook is collecting your data
 chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki fasebuk like or share batan ko agar aapan clic nahin bhi kiya he or sirf wo kisi third party website par maujuud he phir bhi aapkaa data fasebuk ke saath share ho rahaa he
 If your account is not on Facebook and you have come to Facebook to search someone's profile, then in such a situation, Facebook notes your behavior and collects data
 haalanki mark jakarberg yah nahin bataa paae ki fasebuk non yugers kaa kis tarah kaa data fasebuk store karata he
 Congresswoman Castor asked, 'you collect medical data, even those who are Facebook users or not use the Internet' Mark Zuckerberg said in response, 'congresswoman yes, we collect some data'
 iskaa baad unhone poocha ki agar aap data colect karte hai or daawa karte he ki yah security ke liye he to ise turn of karne kaa koi rasta nahin he? jakarberg ne kaha ki, ‘jaahir kaarnon se ham logon ko ko security mejarment turn of karne kii ijaajat nahin dete’mark jakarberg se jab ye sawaal poocha gaya ki kya aap bataa sakate hai ki kitne non fasebuk yugers kaa data aapke paas he
 In response to this, the CEO of Facebook said that this is not the answer in his mind right now, but it can be answered later

" kisi dharmaguru par balaatkaar kaa ilzaam apane-aap main chaunkaanewaala he
 But if a religious leader goes beyond rape and starts group sex with his own devotees, that is, what would you call it? The new charge against Asaram's son Narayan Sai is similar to this
 ye ilzaam ab sirf ilzaam nahin, balki adaalat main pesh kiye gaye dastauez kaa ek ahm hissaa he
 In the light of faith, when the eyes were full of eyes, the living person had become the God of the time
 magar, isi bhagwaan ke chehre se jab paakhand kaa naqaab utarane laga, to dekhne vaale bas dekhte hi rah gaye
 Father-son Asaram and Narayan Sai, who weakened the illusion of sin by taking the form of God, were accused of rape and sexual abuse at a time
 lekin ab narayan sai par jo nayaa ilzaam laga he, usase ajeeb or chaunkaane vaala ilzaam koi ho hi nahin saktaa
 Yes, Narayan Sai is accused of group sex
 group sex, yani samuhik yon krida kaa
 In other words, more than two numbers to establish physical connection at the same time
 narayan sai par ye ilzaam kisi ne chalate-phirte nahin, balki surat ke ek sarkari vakil ne bhari adaalat main lagaaya he
 The Surat public prosecutor has told the court, citing an old seeker of Narayan Sai, that Narayan Sai had sex with 9-10 girls at the same time
 narayan sai ko aisa karte hue khud uske sadhak ne dekha, jisane baad main magistrate ke saamne die gaye bayaan main is baat khulaasa kiya
 Referring to this statement recorded under section 164 of the crpc, the government lawyer surprised every person present in the court
 apane bayaan main is sadhak ne bataaya he ki usne ek hi vaqt main 9-10 ladakiyon ko ek saath narayan sai ke kamare main rahasyamayi halaat main or jate hue dekha
 After this closed-door game in the name of ritual, when the room was cleaned, there were many beer talks
 ye sab kuch usne ek baar nahin, balki kai baar khud apni ankhon se dekha
 If you believe the words of this seeker, Narayan Sai is very fond of beer and group sex and often looks for the opportunity of group sex with new excuses
 lekin ye to jaise narayan sai par lage nae ilzaamon kii ek shuruyaat bhar thi
 In his investigation, the Surat police also came to know that Narayan Sai fraudulently fed drugs to his husbands to trap many such married women in his trap and made them impotent
 aisi koi mahila jab aulad kii aas liye narayan sai ke paas pahunchati yaa phir satsang main haazir hoti, to unhen apane pati ko takat kii dawa dene ke naam par wo jadi-bootiyaan di jaatin, jisase insaan napusank ho saktaa he
 In this way, when Narayan Sai succeeded in his intention, he would also sexually exploit such women in the name of ritual and dedication

 chitrakoot seat par november, 2017 main hue upachunaav ke dauraan madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha tha, ''chitrakoot main ab daaku rahenge yaa shivaraj!jaise chambal se dakaiton ko khaded diya vaise hi chitrakoot se inhen khaded diya jayega
 "but the armed dacoits of 24 October took the driver driving along with a former SDO and retired clerk of the forest department as hostage
" dakaiton ne car main savaar vibhaag ke ritred esadio ramashray pandeya (reva), van vibhaag ke ritred clerk suresh sohagaura ke saath driver ko agava kiya he
 No one else to be kidnapped is the notorious dacoit Lavlesh Cole of one lakh

 But last year, there was a fight between the two and instead of one, two gangs were formed

 yahaan na police aati or na koi adhikari

 kii phiroti maangi he

 aise main logon ko laga tha ki shivaraj vaaki chambal kii tarah yahaan se bhi daakuo kaa safaya karavaaenge
 But Shivraj forgot his promise
 dabe munh kuch log yah bhi kah rahe hai ki is baar vaise bhi madhya pradesh main bhaajapa ke halaat thik nahin

 chitrakoot ke upachunaav main josh main aakar shivaraj singh chouhan ne daakuon ko khuli chunauti to de daali thi lekin chunaav ke ek bitne ke baad bhi vahaan dakait sakriy hai
 It seems that the bandits knew that 'shivraj' does not take election speeches serially

 bollywood actress kaajol or karan johar kii dosti jagajaahir he
 While Karan considers Kajol as his lucky charm, on the one hand, Kajol is never left behind in pursuing friendship
 ye inaki dosti kaa hi asar he ki karan kii lagbhag har film main kaajol jarur najar aati hai
 Karan considers Kajol to be so lucky for his film that if Kajol is not in the lead role in her film, then she would definitely make a cameo
 lekin ab lagata he ki chijen badal gai hai kyonki karan kii film 'i dil he mushkil' main is baar kaajol nahin najar aaengi
 Karanki will compete with this film in her husband's film Shivaay
 aise main jaahir he ki kaajol apane pati ke saath hi khadi rahanaa chahengi
 Let me tell you that a few days ago there were reports that Kajol and Shah Rukh will be seen in this film as a couple for a few moments
 lekin haal hi main bollywood life main chhapi report ke mutabik aisa mumkin nahin he kyonki kaajol apane pati ajay ke khilaaf jaakar kuch bhi nahin karne vaali
 This proves that Kajolan will not be seen in this film
 vaise reports to ye bhi kahati hai ki karan ne is baar kaajol ko approach hi nahin kiya
 Whatever the issue may be, we would hope that both these films, which are releasing near Kidwali, do good business at the box office

 Beggars will be DNA tested in Mumbai and Maharashtra
 mahila or bal vikaas mantralay ne is aashay kaa prastaav mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke paas bheja he
 In Mumbai, 2 thousand children are stolen or missing every year and this number is in millions in the country
 shaq he ki chori ke bacchon kaa bheekh maangane ke liye istemaal hota he
 According to Vidya Thakur, Minister of State in the Ministry of Women and Child Development of Maharashtra, she often used to see women begging a small child in glue at traffic signals
 unki god main padaa baccha naa to rota he naa hi kheltaa he, wo sirf soya rahata he jaise use koi dawaai di gai ho
 Vidya Thakur tells that once she asked one such woman on the signal, whose child is she told her
 lekin jab unhone mobile nikaalkar camere se video bananaa shuru kiya to wo bhaag khadil hui
 Since then, he had in mind that something should be done on this
 isaliye ab jab wo mahila vaa bal kalyaan rajya mantri ban gai hai to aise sabhi bhikhaariyon kaa diene test karaane kaa prastaav taiyaar kiya he
 According to Vidya Thakur, she has also met the Mumbai Police Commissioner regarding this subject
 mantri mahodaya kaa daawa he ki chote bachche or unki maa hone kaa daawa karne vaali bhikhaaran kaa diene test karaane se doharaa phayda hoga
 If their DNA is not found among themselves, it will become clear that the child does not belong to them
 uske baad us bachche kii tasviir websit par daali jaayegi taaki uske apane uski pahchaan kar saken
 According to Mumbai Police, 34787 young children have gone missing or stolen in the city from 2005 to 2014
 ye alag baat he ki unamem se 33383 bachche waapas bhi mil gaye hai
 But 1404 children are still missing
 bhikhaari or beghar bacchon ke liye kaam karne vaali sansthaaon ke mutabik bhikh maangane vaale kuch khaas samudaay se aate hai or unhone apane liye alag-alag trephic signal baant liya he
 High earning signals are also bid
 tippaniyan Childline spokesperson Nishit Kumar considers DNA testing to be a good initiative but says that it is an immediate cure
 jabaki zarurat ek dirghakaalik upaay kii he
 That is why they suggest that after the birth of the child, if all the information from his DNA is recorded in the Aadhaar card, then it will be easier to track the children in case of theft or disappearance
 jo abhi sambhav nahin he
 According to Nishit Kumar, the biggest problem is the rehabilitation of them, there is only one rehabilitation center in the entire state, that too in Kolhapur while the number of beggars are in thousands and are spread all over the state
 maharashtra kii mahila va bal vikaas mantralay kii rajya mantri vidya thakur ke mutabik wo aksar dekha karti thi ki trephic signlon par mahilaayein chote bachche ko gond main lekar bheekh maangati hai
 The child lying on his lap neither cries nor plays, he only sleeps as if he was given some medicine
 vidya thakur bataati hai ki ek baar signal par aisi hi ek mahila se unhone jab poocha baccha kiskaa he to usne apana bataaya
 But when he took out the mobile and started making videos with the camera, he ran away
 tabhi se unke man main tha ki is par kuch karnaa chaiye
 Therefore, now that she has become the Minister of State for Women and Child Welfare, a proposal has been prepared for DNA testing of all such beggars
 vidya thakur ke mutabik is vishay ko lekar wo mumbai police ayukta se bhi mil chuki hai
 The minister claims that beggars who claim to have young children and their mothers will be benefited by double testing
 agar unka diene aapas main nahin mila to ye saaf ho jaayegaa ki baccha uskaa nahin he
 After that the picture of that child will be put on the website so that they can identify themselves
 mumbai police ke mutabik shahar main saal 2005 se 2014 tak 34787 chote bachche laapata yaa chori hue hai
 It is a different matter that 33383 of them have been brought back
 lekin 1404 bachche ab bhi laapata hai
 According to organizations that work for beggars and homeless children, beggars come from certain communities and have distributed different traffic signals for themselves
 zyada kamai vaale signlon kii boli bhi lagati he
 The comments chield line ke pravaktaa nishit kumaar diene test karaane ko ek acchhee pahal to maanate hai lekin unka kahana he ki ye fori ilaaj he
 While the need is a long-term remedy
 isaliye unka suzav he ki bachche ke janm ke baad hi aadhaar card main uske diene se lekar sari jaankaree darj kii jaye to chori yaa laapata hone kii surat main bacchon ko trek karnaa aasaan ho jaayegaa
 Which is not possible right now
 nishit kumaar ke mutabik sabase badi samasya inke punarvaas kii he, puure rajya main sirf ek hi punarvaas kendra he wo bhi kolhapur main jabaki bheekh maangane waalon kii taadaad hazaron main he or puure rajya main faile hai

 At the same time, the Congress does not appear to be in any hurry before reaching any decision

 NCP Chief Sharad Pawar on being asked if there is a meeting scheduled today between Congress and NCP: Who says there is a meeting? i don't know
 # maharashtragovtformationpic
 twitter
 com / orgqwfybzj Earlier after BJP (BJP) and Shiv Sena (now Shiv Sena), the Governor now asked the NCP if she would like to form the government? After this, Ajit Pawar and Rohit Pawar reached their house to meet former NCP Chief Sharad Pawar
 bataate chale ki shivasena ne rajyapal se sarkaar banane kii ichha jataate hue 48 ghante kaa samay maanga tha lekin rajyapal ne samay nahin diya
 After which the Governor has asked the third largest party NCP in the state about forming the government and has given it till 8:30 pm on Tuesday night
 NCP subah 11 baje apane vidhayakon ke saath baithak karegi
 Sharad Pawar and Supriya Sule left together for the meeting, while Ajit Pawar left the other car
 baithak main jane se pehle ajit pavaar ne kaha, ''dilli se congress kaa phone tha ki kya aaj dilli main sharad pavaar meeting ke liye aa sakate hai
 We said that today we have a meeting with mlas, so it will not be possible
 lekin maharashtra ke congress netaaon se hamane kaha he ki wo mumbai aaen or ham meeting kar ek kaaman minimum kaarykram banaate hai unhone kaha he aane ke liye dekhte hai
 The Congress is still waiting for its reply
 ''yah poochne par ki congress netaa agar aaj aa nahin rahe hai to raashtrapati shashan lag jaayegaa? to unhone kaha ki yahaan aana jaruri nahin he
 There can be talk on the phone too
 ajit pavaar ne ye saaf kiya ki congress ke saath milakar chunaav ladaa he or jo bhi faisla he wo saath main he
 We have never fought elections together with Shiv Sena, so the Congress is taking some time
 duusari taraf congress ne shivasena ke samarthan ko lekar ab tak apane pattey nahin khole hai
 The Congress met twice on Monday, but yielded no results
 mangalvaar ko congress or ensipi kii baithak honi he, lekin atkal ye bhi he ki ye baithak tal gai he, kyonki dilli se koi bhi congress netaa mumbai nahin ja rahaa he
 Earlier in Maharashtra, the Governor did not give the 48-hour extension to the Shiv Sena, on Sunday, the Governor wrote a letter to the Shiv Sena and said that on Monday, he wished to form the government by 7:30 pm, on behalf of the Shiv Sena, Aditya Thackeray went to the Raj Bhavan to form the government
 Took and asked for 48 hours, which they did not get
 aakhir australia ne record paanchavin baar khitaab jitkar isisi vishwa cap 2015 kaa shandaar samaapan kiya
 New Zealand looked hopeful, bringing back memories of my experience when i first made it to the final of the World Cup in 2003
 us samay ham bahut acha khel rahe the, hamaare bich badhibia talmail tha or final ke liye sabhi khiladinnon main baari josh tha
 The New Zealand team also looked in the same style to a large extent, but eventually collapsed
 donon avasaron par pehle hi over main final kaa nakshaa saaf ho gaya tha
 We had conceded too many runs in our first over, while New Zealand lost the wicket of their captain Brendon mccullum
 newjiland shuruyaat se hi kabhi bhi aisi gati nahin pakad sakaa, jo puri pari tak chali ho, usne jaldi-jaldi wicket ganvaae or chunauteepurn score pesh karne main naakaam rahaa
 After mccullum's dismissal, i felt that Martin Guptill and Kane Williamson had given their consent to bowling
 ve jarurat se zyada satark ho gaye the or unhone chor utani teji se nahin badale, jitani teji se unhen badalane chahie the
 There was a good partnership between Grant Elliott and Ross Taylor, but conditions did not remain in New Zealand's favor after Taylor's wicket fell
 vah din-raat ke khel kaa vah daur tha, jisamen parchhaayi pich par utarane lagati he or gend dekhnaa ek chunauti ho sakati he
 His hopes of presenting a contingent figure were lost after Corey Anderson's wicket on a brilliant yorker and then soon after Luke Ronchi was dismissed
 beshak, australian team ko 183 ke bheetar rokna kisi chamatkaar se kam kuch nahin hota
 But miracles rarely happen
 ant main clark or unki team ko newjiland kaa vijay rath roak lene or pratishthit trophy jeetne ke liye puure number die jane chahie
 It was a World Cup that was completely tilted in favor of the batsmen for more than one reason
 isliye yah dekhnaa bahut acha tha ki final kaa faisla kisi ballebaaj ke asaadhaaran pari khele jane kii bajaae nirnaayak gendbaaji se hua tha
 In the same context, i also believe that Wahab Riaz's bowling to Shane Watson in the pakistan-australia match will be one of the most memorable moments of this year's World Cup
 danniel vittori or aar
 Spinners like Ashwin proved to be superior due to their shrewdness and crilight, while Mitchell Starc, Wahab Riaz, Trent Boult, Dale Steyn, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Mohit Sharma, and a few other bowlers enjoyed the game and took advantage of the conditions
 kai mudde hai, jinhen maine pichley kuch hafton main uthaaya haih chaahe vah do safed gendon kaa maamla ho, jinke kaaran reverse swing kaa sawaal hi khatm ho jaataa tha, yaa ek kshetrarakshak kam hone kaa maamla, jo gendbaajon ke liye halaat ko or kathin bana detaa tha, vishesh rup se aakhri overon main
 One of the more obvious issues was the referral system for LBW, which i have found inconsistent and contradictory
 jab kisi nirnay par gendbaaj punarvichaar kii apil karata he, jise puraa vishwaas ho ki gend stump ko uda rahi he, or technology isaki pushti bhi karti ho, tab yah durbhagyapurna he ki maidan par khadey ampire kaa mul nirnay tabhi mana jayega, jab gend kaa ek hissaa maatr stump se takaraa rahaa ho
 On the other hand, if a batsman is declared out by the umpire, and he appeals to reconsider the decision and then once the technology states that a part of the ball is hitting the stump, the batsman is considered out
 Because it was the umpire's original decision
 yah virodhabhas tisare ampire or technology ke upyog ko nakaar detaa he
 He is of no importance
 yah niyam us sthiti main khaskar kathor ho saktaa he jab khilaadi gend kii gati-disha ke bare main sahaj taur par sahi ho
 Not only does the decision go against him due to a margin of error, but the team also loses a decisive referral
 main samajhataa hum ki takanic abhi bhi 100 pratishat sateek nahin he, lekinek hi technology sabhi ke liye he, lihaaja sambhawatah niyam or adhik susangat ho sakate the
 The rules should be uniform, independent of the field umpire, in which if less than half the ball hits the stump, the batsman must be deemed not out (or out), regardless of the original decision
 yaa phir, agar maidan par khadey ampire kaa nirnay antim he or technology dikhaa rahi he ki gend stump se takaraa rahi he, to samiksha karne vaali team kaa ek refral khatm nahin hona chahie
 In fact, instead of making more complex rules due to technology limitations, we should think towards improving technology
 tabhi ham susangat or khel ke liye upyogi niyam bana sakenge
 We are in a period in which our performance is constantly monitored by the media, but i do not think it gives anyone the right to provoke or carry out personal attacks
 kuch gaiyr-jimmedaar media sansthaanon ne maidan par ek kharaab din bitne ke aadhaar par hamaari bhartiya team par jis tareeke se hallaa bol diya, usase main bahut adhik niraash ho gaya tha
 Our team's superb and consistent performance on the field during the entire World Cup was forgotten at their convenience
 maujuuda team india ke zyaadaatar khiladinnon ke saath khel chuke hone ke aadhaar par main pathakon ko is bare main aashwast kar saktaa hum ki unamem patibaddhta yaa samarpan kii koi kami nahin he or koi khilaadi is vishwaas ke bina semifinal main pravesh nahin kar saktaa he ki use vishwa cricket ke sabase bade mukaable main khelnaa he
 Beyond the performance, the tournament also witnessed some memorable moments on the field
 apni pehali jeet darj karaane ke baad afghanistan ne jaisi khushi kaa izhaar kiya, haar ke baad udhaas del sten ko uthaae hue grant iliyat ko dekhnaa, apni aakhri pari khelkar baahar jate zimbobwe ke brendan tailor ko bhartiya team ke khiladinnon kaa garimapurna vidaai dena, or haar ke kagaar par brendan makkulam kaa aage badhkar maaikel clark se haath milaanaa, yah darshata he ki khel kii bhaavana aaj bhi puri tarah jivit he
 With the ICC World Cup 2015, the ODI international career of many greats also ended
 jahaan clark ko to bahut upyukt vidaai mil gai he, vahiin meraa dil kumaar sangakaara, mahela jayavardhane, shahid aafridi, misbah-ul-haq, kyle mills, brendan tailor or danniel vittori ke saath he
 All these have served the game for a long time and created a niche for themselves in the minds of fans
 toornament kaa ekadam alahada kism kaa match to newjiland or dakshin africa ke bich khelaa gaya semifinal hi he
 It had all the elements of a match that all the spectators crave, which the players expect, and the history that awaits
 aakhri over ke khatm hone tak donon pakshon kii ore se jis dhairya or kshamta kaa pradarshan kiya gaya, vah bilkul sheersh str kaa tha, or vishwa ke agrani tej gendbaajon main se ek ko post karke newjiland ko jitate dekhnaa ek aisi patakatha he, jise doosraa koi nahin likh saktaa
 As a spectator from the gallery i have enjoyed my first World Cup
 mere liye un lakhon logon main se ek hona sukhad tha jo aakhir tak bhartiya team ke liye taaliyaan bajaate rahe, or is baar haar se ubarne ke is kathin daur ke dauraan bhi main unka samarthan karata rahoonga, unke saath bana rahoonga
 As i say even today, be it win or lose, you should enjoy this game for its amazing ups and downs
 anischitata or utaar-chadhaav hi to is khel kaa asli majaa he
 If you are not able to enjoy things beyond the result, then it is time for you to do something else
 main is toornament ke sabhi ''vijetaon'' ko badhai detaa hum, kyonki agar aapane maidan par khud majaa liya he, to yah khel jeet gaya he
 The ability to enjoy the game is the only aspect that allows you to keep playing
 lihaaja, jab tak aglaa vishwa cap nahin aata, tab tak nateezon par dhyaan na dekar isi kaa anand adhik liya janaa chahie

 com / 9q7dkbwlbu— Yo Yo Honey Singh (@asliyoyo)december 16, 2017 The controversy arising out of the statement of Trinamool Congress MP Tapas Pal related to the murder and misdemeanor did not calm down that another MLA from the party has given rise to another controversy in the state by giving a statement of 'real human effigy'
 trinmul se jude progressive doctors association kii baithak ko sambodhit karte hue iske adhyaksh or vidhayak nirmal maanjhi ne buudhvaar ko kaha tha ki kya log un chikistakon ke 'asli maanav putale' phunkenge, jinhone apane teen sahakarmiyon ke nilamban par mukhyamantri kaa putala jalaayaa tha
 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had suspended several medical officers including Anup Kumar Roy, Principal of North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, while holding the doctors responsible for the increasing effects of encephalitis
 roy marxvaadi communist party (makapa) se jude association of health sarvice doctors (eechesdi) ke sadsy bhi hai
 Manjhi said, "it is okay that Roy is the leader of the cpi-m's AHSD, but he works only two days a week and stays at home for the rest of the week
 jab prashasan ne unke khilaaf karrwai kii, to chikitsak mukhyamantri kaa putala jala rahe hai
 " unhone kaha, "ab sirf yah dekhnaa he ki kya ab log vaastavik insaani putale ko jalaayenge
 " sarkaar ko inseflitis se judi jaankariyaan samay par na die jane ke aarope main nilambit kiye gaye kuch chikitsakon ne roy or anya ke khilaaf kii gai karrwai ko anyaaypurna qaraar dete hue unhen phir behaal karne kii maang kii or kaha ki sarkaar ko uchit samay par jaankaree di gai thi
 Manjhi's statement has been condemned by politicians and doctors
 makapa ke netaa sujon chakravarti ne kaha, "ab hamaare paas netaa hai jo logon ko jalaane kii salaah de rahe hai
 What else can you expect from the Trinamool which is appreciating people like Tapas Pal and those giving inflammatory speeches
 " Criticizing Manjhi, AHSD President Gautam Mukherjee said that this statement does not suit a doctor

 The balloon on which Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was sitting and taking stock of the politics of the country and the state has lost its air
 jis tarah se unhone bihar main bijepi ko satta se baahar nikaal kar ek dhamaakaa kiya or narendra modi ke khilaaf zehar ugala usase laga ki vah desh kii raajnneeti main ek badi takat ke rup main ubhar rahe hai
 The kind of warmth the Congress showed with him and wooed him thought that the matter had been made
 nitish kumaar kii yojana saaf thi ki bijepi kaa saath chhodkar congress ko yah dikhaaya jaae ki vah unke kareebi hai taaki vah bihar ko pichhadaa rajya ghoshit kara saken or rajya main vaah wahi lut saken
 His intention was to stand as a pillar against Narendra Modi and to retain his authority over the Muslim vote bank in Bihar
 iskaa phayda yah tha ki vah is tarah se congress ko apane paale main laa sakenge
 There was no fault in Nitish Kumar's thinking
 vah ek raajnneetijna hai or apane pattey khud khilne main yakeen karte hai
 But he forgot one thing that there is also Lalu Prasad Yadav in Bihar who is engaged in luring Congress
 unke sonia gandhi se achche sambandh hai or vah kai baar to unke pravaktaa ke rup main bolne tak lag jate hai! nitish kumaar shaayad ek or baat bhul gaye
 The Congress has the most experience of running the government

 Now they understand that this is an attempt by the Congress to make a dent in their Muslim vote bank
 unka to yahaan tak kahana he ki us campus ke liye zamin kaa chayan unhone hi kiya tha or uski keemat bhi nahin lee gai thi
 Now he has understood that nothing came to his hand
 nitish kumaar kii sarkaar abhi surakshit he or aage bhi surakshit rahegi
 But the strength he wanted to demonstrate in the Lok Sabha elections is no longer visible
 unke saamne bijepi hi nahin argedy-congress gathbandhan kii bhi chunauti he
 It is beyond their control to win in two straight battles against two rivals, as the opinion polls have shown

 Nitish Kumar is alone in the battle ahead

 a post shared by Colors TV (@colorstv) on Feb 10, 2018 at 10:07am PSTA post shared by Jennifer Winget (@jenniferwinget1) on Nov 22, 2017 at 12:29am PST Attacking Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on behalf of the BJP, Union Minister Kapil Sibal said on Sunday that the Gujarat riots had shaken up to the extent that Modi made this claim for quite a while
 sibbal ne kaha ki ek blog main unka haalia bayaan loksabhaa chunaav se pehle der se pratikriya he
 Sibal has written on his website, 'modi will continue to bear the burden of riots
 unhone yah jaahir karne main kaaphi der kar di ki isane unhen bheetar tak hilaa diya tha
 If that had happened, his heart would have reacted in time
 loksabhaa chunaav ke thik pehle der se pratikriya nahin vyakt kii hoti
 ' kendriyamantri ne kaha ki 'modi ke blog main 'dukh or vyathaa' ek aise shrota ke liye thi jinaki sahanubhuti may, 2014 main mahatvapurn hogi
 He said that pain is a heart touching, automatic and feeling that is expressed without any addition or subtraction
 unhone kaha, 'dard 11 saal ke maun ke baad der se pratikriya kabhi nahin ho sakati
 And a person who suffers in silence cannot remain silent for 11 years
 main apni tippanee main swaarthee nahin hona chahta, main beyimaan nahin ho saktaa
 This act of liberation does not connect us with the real Modi
 ' Sibal was reacting to a blog post written by the Chief Minister of Gujarat in which he said he was 'feeling free and at peace' after being given a clean chit by the local court in the 2002 riot cases
 unhone daawa kiya tha ki hatyaon ke liye dosharopan se vah 'tut' chuke the
 Modi avoided media inquiries on the issue for more than a decade and never apologized for the riots
 unhone apane blog main kaha tha ki vah dangon se bheetar tak hill gaye the
 Referring to Modi's blog, Sibal wondered which brother and sister the Chief Minister of Gujarat was referring to when he was talking about his personal pain
 sibbal ne kaha ki jin logon ne apane bhaaiyon or bahanon ko kho diya unhen maraham kii jarurat thi or vah bhi dangon ke turant baad
 Sibal said, '11 years is too late
 ' modi ke blog ke jawaab main apane lekh main sibbal ne kaha ki peediton kii khaufnak agnipariksha par dhyaan die jane kii aavashyaktaa he, na ki modi kii agnipariksha par
 Modi should have knowledge of scripture in 2002 and not in 2013
 sibbal ne kaha, 'jo ekant main yojana banaate hai ve kabhi bhi ekant main dard mahasoos nahin karte
 People who believe in Newton's law of motion do not wait 11 years to react
 ' Sibal asked many questions
 unhone poocha ki 'dard' tab kahaan tha jab gujarat sarkaar ne un logon kaa bachaav kiya, jo ab doshi sabit ho chuke hai
 Sibal asked, 'where was the pain when an affidavit was filed in the courts regarding his (convicts') innocence
 dard tab kahaan tha jab asamarthaneey logon kaa bachaav karne ke liye vakeelon ko bhugtan kiya gaya
 Where was the pain when the state did not come to help those who were moaning for help
 dard tab kahaan tha jab log nyaay maang rahe the lekin unhen thand main chhod diya gaya tha
 Where was the pain when the accused were being tried in court, the state was working closely with them to decide their affidavit
 ' Ashok Chaudhary is the head of the OBC cell of bjp's Kota (rajasthan) district
 unhone 3 farvari ko party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ko patr likhaa
 It said that early changes at the level of government and organization in the state are necessary for victory in this year's assembly and next year's Lok Sabha elections
 is patr kaa koi uttar abhi tak rashtriya adhyaksh kii ore se nahin aayaa he lekin pradesh or centre ke kai netaa choudhary kii chintaa ko galat nahin maanate
 Therefore, the mood of change in the party is becoming
 bhaajapa ke liye rajasthan jaisi chintaa padosi rajya madhya pradesh se bhi he
 But there is immediate relief for Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan from the fact that the desire for change in the workers, the heat of the organization is still there
 sarkaar isaki jad se philhal baahar he
 The large margin BJP lost in the Alwar and Ajmer Lok Sabha and Mandalgarh assembly by-elections also opened the way for the party high command to ponder over the option of change of leadership
 sutron kaa kahana he ki haar kii vajah ko lekar pradesh adhyaksh ashok paranami ne amit shah ke saamne prabandhan main hui choti-moti chook kaa jo tark rakhaa, use shah ne yah kehete hue khaarij kar diya ki "prabandhan kii chook se itane bade antar se haar nahin hoti he, yah sarkaar ke khilaaf naaraazgi kaa namoona he
 However, Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has told the high command that she alone cannot be blamed for the defeat in the by-elections
 vaise, shah ne apane is akalan se pradesh sarkaar or sanghathan ko parivartan kii sambhaavna kaa sanket de diya
 Last week, there have been two long talks between Shah and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 bataaya jaataa he ki unki baatcheet main netritv parivartan kaa masalaa bhi uthaa
 Party sources say that Raje is ready for a reshuffle in the organization at the state level, but she wants someone who can replace him (vasundhara) to replace Parnami
 saath hi pradesh adhyaksh aisa nahin ho jise kaaryakarta mukhyamantri ke vikalp ke rup main dekhne lagen
 Though the central leadership did not give any assurance to Raje in this regard, only he listened to them but the top leadership managed to persuade Raje to a great extent (not for change)
 rajasthan bhaajapa main dakhal rakhane vaale party ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai ki pradesh kii taraf se netritv parivartan ko lekar kai suzav aae
 There were also suggestions for making two Deputy Chief Ministers, exposing a Rajput face for the state president
 isi bich dalit andolan se bane siyaasi sameekaran main yah suzav bhi aayaa ki kisi dalit ko vasundhara kii jagah netritv saunp diya jaae
 Sources say that this seems unlikely, although a BJP general secretary says that this movement has confirmed the rapid change in both the states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 donon hi rajyon main 2 april ko dalit virodh pradarshan kaa jor rahaa
 In such a state, by including the people of Dalit community in the organization and government in these states, the party can make sure that the BJP is with the Dalits
 bhaajapa alaakaman ke kareebi logon kaa kahana he ki amuman chunaav se 6-8 maheene pehle netritv parivartan karne se party bachati he lekin rajasthan bhaajapa shasit anya rajyon se is baar kuch alag he
 Since the BJP has been in power for the last several elections in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat or Chhattisgarh, there is no reason to change the government in these states just months before the elections
 rajasthan main aisa nahin he
 There the government has been changing every five years
 janata kii taraf se is voting pattern ke saath hi haalia up-chunaav main mili haar ke alaava kaaryakartaaon main asantosh kii bhaavana bhi saaf dikh rahi he
 The change of state president and some ministers is an option as there is no strong leader in place of Raje in the state and standing in opposition to Raje in the election year may cause more damage to the party
 bhaajapa mahasachiv bhupendra yadav is baat se ittefaq rakhte hai ki kuch dikkat kii baat kaaryakartaaon kii ore se bataai gai he lekin ve kehete hai, "inhen dur kar liya jayega
 Chances of change are also in Rajasthan's neighboring state of Madhya Pradesh
 sanghathan ke str par badlaav kii taiyaari puri ho chuki he
 In the feedback received from the state, there are complaints about the government but not resentment
 naaraazgi sanghathan ke str par jarur he
 Since state president Nandkumar Chauhan is considered close to Shivraj, there is a perception that he (nandakumar) adopts Talu attitude regarding the complaints of the workers
 aise main aalaa netritv yah chahega ki sanghathan main shivaraj jaise kaddavar netaa kii tainaati ho
 The name of Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar is in the discussion for this
 par tomars kehete hai, "rajya sanghathan main netritv parivartan ko lekar koi charchaa nahin ho rahi he
 However, many BJP leaders have not hesitated to speak openly about Tomar's ability
 bhaajapa mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey haalanki netritv parivartan ko lekar chuppi saadh jate hai lekin ve kehete hai, "shivaraj or tomars kii jodi ke netritv main bhaajapa ne madhya pradesh main shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 "in view of this, the high command can try the pair once again
" chunaav se mahaj kuch maheene pehle in donon pramukh rajyon main parivartan kii taiyaari darasal bhaajapa adhyaksh shah ke mishan 2019 se judi he
 Sources say that any decision will be taken by the shah-modi duo in an attempt to save Rajasthan and win big in Madhya Pradesh
 loksabhaa chunaav main mahaj chaar-paanch maheene pehle agar donon rajya haath se nikal gaye to 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye party ko vah badhat nahin milegi jise use darkaar he
 Losing these two states means getting the Congress alive, as the BJP is directly facing the Congress in both these states
 iske ulat agar bhaajapa in donon rajyon main jeet hasil karti he to 2019 ke liye party kaaryakartaaon ko yah sandesh diya ja saktaa he ki modi or shah ke netritv main bhaajapa ajey he
 In such a situation, the bjp's slogan of Congress Mukt Bharat will be used to excite the party workers

 arvind ne likhaa, ‘salmaan khurshid ne mujhe dhamkee dihe
 The language he has used does not suit the law minister of this country
 ’arvind kejariwal ne congress ko bhi aagaah karte hue kaha he use desh ke gusse ko pahchaanana chahie, ab dhamkiyon se kaam nahin chalegaa
 However, the country's politics has been warmed by the latest allegations made by Kejriwal
 arvind ne likhaa, ‘mujhe dhamkee dene se acha he ki congress janata ke gusse ko samajhe ourabhrashtacharmitane ke liye pukhta kadam uthaae
 'apart from this, Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday that Khulasepar said,' Right now i cannot say anything

 The BJP, which was attacked, had the election ammo fit for itself in its manifesto, this question because the BJP did not delay in taking out the cannon on the things stated in promise number 30 of the manifesto
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki is menifesto main aise agenda hai jo desh ko todane kaa kaam karte hai, raashtra kii ekta ke khilaaf jate hai
 The Congress party, which was a historic mistake of the gandhi-nehru family in particular, is working to advance that agenda in a more dangerous manner in relation to Jammu and Kashmir for which the country can never forgive
 rahul gandhi ke liye mushkil ye bhi he ki vah chunaav se pehle nyaay ke jariye nerrative set karne kii baat kah rahe the, lekin ab mudda ek baar phir rashtrawaad par jaakar atak gaya he

 Sant Gopaldas, who is fasting for the last three days to clean the Ganges, is missing from AIIMS
 is bare main do din tak jaankaree ko chhipaae rakhane ke baad guuruuvaar ko ames ke medical suprimetendent (emes) ne aam aadmi party ke netaa edwocket somnath bharti ke saath gopaldaas ke pita or unke samarthakon ko jaankaree di
 But this information has raised many questions
 kya centre sarkaar ganga kii safai kii maang kar rahe santon se vaaki ghabara gai he? kya swami nigamanand, swami gokulanand, professor ji
 D
 agarwal (swami sanand) ke baad ab sant gopaldaas ganga kii safai ke liye bali chadh gaye yaa chadha die gaye?darasal aam aadmi party ke netaa somanath bharti sant gopaldaas ke gaayab hone ke baad se hi ames main dharnarat the
 Their demand was that where should Saint Gopaldas be informed? First, the AIIMS administration ignored him
 lekin jab sant gopaldaas ke pita, somnath bharti or samarthak vahiin dante rahe to ames ke emes ko munh kholana padaa
 It was learned that he was admitted to a hospital in Dehradun
 par ames se doon shift karne kii vajah phir bhi nahin bataai gai
 When traced by Doon, the government's cruel attitude came to the fore with the persistence of the saints
 kaaphi mathapai karne ke baad sthaneey patrakaron ko pataa laga ki unhen yahaan ke ek aspataal main 5 disambar 2018 ko ‘laavarish’ bataakar bhartee kiya gaya tha
 Who were the people to recruit him, who brought him from Delhi AIIMS to Dehradun? All these questions could not be answered by that hospital in Dehradun
 kareeb aath baje aspataal ne dehradun police ko suchit kiya ki gopaldaas achaanak gaayab ho gaye hai
 The police tried to find him quietly without making this information public
 lekin jab unhen chah disambar kii shaam tak nahin khoja ja sakaa to kuch patrakaron ko police ne isaki jaankaree di
 Who was saint Gopaldas Gopaldas was a saint of Matrisadan Ashram located in Haridwar
 ve pichley 168 dinon se anshan main hai
 Even before this ashram, two saints have sacrificed for cleaning the Ganges
 sant nigamanand or swami gokulanand
 Prof
 who laid down his life while fasting for the Ganges
 ji di agarwal yaa swami sanand matrusadan kaa sthaayee hissaa nahin the
 But his association was definitely with this ashram
 abhi is samay aatmbodhanand or puneanand ganga kii safai ke liye anshnarat hai
 It has been 48 days for these two saints also fasting
 kahin koi anisht kaa sanket to nahin!sant gopaldaas ke gurubhai aatmbodhanand ji ne bataaya ki unase 24 aktubar ko ashram ke logon kii mulaakaat hui thi
 Even then, he had said, "I have a problem with the government being here
" shaayad ye mujhe or kahin le jaaen
 He had also expressed the suspicion that these people can also leave Matrasadan by giving me slow poison, so that i can die there and the government should escape my charge of murder
 lekin main yahaan se kahin nahin jaaoongaa’’
 "gopaldas was first taken to AIIMS, Rishikesh, then Jolly Grant, then Chandigarh and then to AIIMS, Delhi," says Atmabodhananda
 dehradun ke aspataal main laane se pehle ashram ko soochna tak nahin di gai
 He was once also left Lavarish at Triveni Ghat
 ’’aatmbodhanand par bhi he najaratmbodhanand ke anshan ne bhi prashasan kii neende uda di hai
 He was forcefully taken to AIIMS, Rishikesh four days ago
 unhen vahaan jabaran liquid food dene kii koshish kii gai
 Atmabandhanand contacted the people of the ashram and told them about the misbehavior being done with them in the hospital, and after talking to the administration, they were discharged from the hospital
 pita ko likhi aakhri chittheenovember ke duusare hafte main sant gopaldaas ne apane pita ko ek chitthee likhi thi
 In this, he had clearly written that the government wants to remove him from Delhi and send him somewhere far away
 unhone apane pita se 25 november ko jantar-mantar main hone vaale virodh pradarshan main bhi shaamil hone ke liye kaha tha
 The old father said, PM Saheb Ganga's second son is missing, where are you? The father of Sant Gopaldas told that since December 5, he has been in a dharna outside the AIIMS Medical Superintendent Office
 lekin unki sunne vaala koi nahin
 Some are saying that they had been left outside Jolly Grant Hospital in Dehradun, while some are saying that they had been admitted to the hospital
 lekin ab to dur ke aspataal main bhi pataa laga liya gaya ‘gopal’ vahaan nahin he
 He said that if i tried to report to the Delhi Police, the report was not recorded
 bas aplicoshan lekar uski riciving de di gai
 His father says that i will not leave here until my boy is found
 kareeb 75 varsh ke pita kaa kahana he ki maa ganga ke bulaave par piem modi banaras pahunche the
 Now why is he silent on the disappearance of my Gopal sitting on a hunger strike for the same mother? Do they really consider Ganga as a mother or is Ganga the only medium of politics for them? Father said in a loud voice, my heart is getting heavy
 man main bure khyaal aa rahe hai, kahin meraa betaa bhi to

 The government passed this ordeal as SP and BSP mps walked out before voting
 loksabhaa main bispi saansadon ne walkout kar diya tha
 BSP mps did this walkout because of Union Minister Anand Sharma's response to opposition leader Sushma Swaraj's questions
 unka kahana tha ki mantri unke prashnon kaa koi jawaab nahin de rahe hai
 At the same time, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav told media persons after the walkout that FDI in retail was an insult to farmers and small shopkeepers
 ise hi vajah bataate hue unhone loksabhaa se apni party ke samarthakon ke saath walkout kiya
 The SP has 22 mps in the Lok Sabha and the BSP 21
 isse bahumat kaa aankada kam ho jaataa he
 Prior to voting in the Lok Sabha, the Samajwadi Party had made it clear for the first time in its conversation with NDTV that it would not vote in favor of the government
 isliye unhone voting se pehle walkout kar sarkaar kaa saath diya
 In a conversation with NDTV India's political editor Manoranjan Bharti on Wednesday morning, Samajwadi Party General Secretary Ram Gopal Yadav has clearly said that either he will vote against the government or will not be present in the house while voting in the house
 vahiin sarkaar ne aaj kaha ki vah samarthan ke liye vibhinn dalon se sampark banaae hue he
 Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajiv Shukla told reporters in Parliament House Complex, "we are in touch with all (parties)
" hamane unase samarthan kaa anurodh kiya he
 FDI will not hurt the interests of farmers and small traders, but it will only help them
 janata dal (united) ke netaa sharad yadav ne buudhvaar ko loksabhaa main sarkaar se aagrah kiya ki use retail main epadiai ke nirnay par punarvichaar karnaa chahie
 Yadav said that the UPA government may win this battle in the House, but this policy will have far-reaching consequences
 sharad yadav ne kaha, aap ladaai jeet sakate hai
 
 
 But future generations will not forgive us
 yadav ne kendriya mantri kapil sibbal kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha, aapako is nirnay par punarvichaar karnaa chahie
 Sharad Yadav said that the opposition's intention is not to destabilize the government, but to create pressure to withdraw FDI in retail
 jediu netaa ne kaha, yadi ham sarkaar ko asthir karnaa chaahate, to ham sheetakaaleen satr ke aarambh main trinmul congress dwaara laae gaye avishvaas prastaav kaa samarthan kiye hote
 Now their leaders are not talking to us
 yadav ne kaha, ham desh ko bachaane ke liye epadiai kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 
 
 Walmart is here for profit
 yah desh ke garibon ke khilaaf he or aap ise thope rahe hai
 Earlier, on Tuesday, strongly advocating withdrawal of the FDI decision in multibrand retail, Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav warned the government that if it does not step back, it will suffer heavy losses in the upcoming general election and BJP power i will come tippaniyan Mulayam also called for an all-party meeting on this issue and advocated a concrete framework for the development of the country
 epadiai kaa kadaa or spasht virodh karte hue mulaayam ne bhavi chunavi samikarnon kaa sanket dete hue kaha ki vah yaa to congress ko samarthan denge yaa phir samarthan lenge
 Mulayam warned the Congress against the backdrop of FDI in view of the upcoming general election, saying the election is coming
 ye (bijepi) chaalaak log hai
 Sangh (rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) is spread in every village
 aapako (congress) chunaav kii drushti se bhi koi laabh nahin hoga
 This (BJP) will come to power
 ham to aane vaale nahin hai
 We will cooperate or take it
 unhone pradhanmantri manmohan singh se epadiai ke faisle ko kuch samay ke liye taalane kaa aagrah karte hue kaha ki agar phayda miltaa dikhegaa, to ham bhi samarthan kar denge, lekin abhi ise chhod dijie

 Yeddyurappa is credited with forming the party's first government in South India
 yediurppa ko gat july main party ke kendriya netritv ne mukhyamantri ke pad se istipha dene ke liye majaboor kiya tha
 This was done after he was accused in the Lokayukta report on illegal mining

 In the Indian Test squad for the Test series with New Zealand, it was expected that perhaps Gautam Gambhir would be given a chance in place of Rohit Sharma or Shikhar Dhawan
 dilip trophy main gambhir kaa balla shandaar tareeke se bol rahaa he, vahiin rohit kaa balla khamosh he
 His total batting in the West Indies yielded fifty runs
 phir bhi chayankartaaon ne naam ke boote unhen mauka de diya
 Rohit Sharma's bat has forgotten to speak
 west indies main do test maichon main unke 9 or 41 ran kaa score isaki baangi bhar he
 He has scored 50 runs just once in the last seven innings
 lekin in tamaam naakaamiyon ke bich rohit team main jagah banane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 When asked about this, Chief Selector Sandeep Patil said, "rohit Sharma is a very good player
 unamem bahut pratibha he
 But he has not got much chance in Test cricket
 hamen lagata he ki sirf rohit hi nahin jise bhi chunaa jaae use ek eemaandaar mauka dena chahie
 The comments saal 2013 main apane test kariyar kaa aagaaj karne vaale rohit ne apane debyue match main 177 ranon kii shandaar pari kheli
 Even after that he scored 111 runs, but after that, in 18 Tests, Rohit scored 946 runs, 32
 62 ke ausat se
 This includes four half-centuries and two centuries
 haalanki van-de main rohit abhi bhi shandaar hai, lekin yahaan kahani 5 dinon ke khel kii he, jisamen dam-kham ke saath dhairya kii bhi jarurat he
 He was also given a chance in the Duleep Trophy to test Rohit but his bat also spoke there
 shaayad captain kii kohli kii kareebi or naam kaam aayaa nahin to test maichon kii unki haal philhal kii pari kisi kaam kii nahin he
 By the way, he has a golden opportunity to confirm his place by passing New Zealand Test for the 13 Test matches coming to his home
 rohit sharma kaa balla bolnaa bhul gaya he
 His score of 9 and 41 runs in two Tests in the West Indies is his hallmark
 pichhali saat pariyon main unhone sirf ek baar 50 ran banaae hai
 But in the midst of all these failures, Rohit has managed to make a place in the team
 is bare main puche jane par mukhya chayankarta sandip patil ne kaha " rohit sharma bahut shandaar khilaadi hai
 They have a lot of talent
 lekin test cricket main unhen bahut zyada mauka nahin mila he
 We feel that not just Rohit, whoever is chosen should be given an honest chance
 tippaniyan Rohit, who made his Test debut in 2013, played a brilliant innings of 177 runs in his debut match
 uske baad bhi 111 ran jade lekin uske baad 18 test maichon main rohit ne 946 ran hi banaae, 32
 At an average of 62
 isamen chaar ardhashatak or do shatak shaamil hai
 Although Rohit is still great in one-day, but the story here is of 5 days game, which also requires patience with dum-kham
 rohit ko parakhane ke liye unhen dalip trophy main bhi ek mauka diya gaya lekin vahaan bhi unka balla bol gaya
 Perhaps the captain's close proximity to Kohli and his name did not work, otherwise his recent innings of Test matches is of no use
 vaise apane ghar main aane vaale 13 test maichon ke liye newjiland kaa test paas kar apni jagah pakki karne kaa unke paas sunaharaa mauka he

 Narayanasamy had pointed out the Centre's alleged double standards regarding Puducherry to declare Puducherry a 'transgender state'

 Why has Narayanasamy's view changed now? Kiran Bedi, while dismissing Narayanasamy's allegations, said, "what he is saying is exactly the opposite of what he used to say when he was in the Indian government
" puducheri ke siem ke naate wo ab uskaa samarthan nahin karnaa chaahate
 He himself needs to clarify why his attitude to see his office has changed now
 ye samaan kanoon or samaan niyam he jo bharat kii sansad ne banaae hai
 These did not change even when he was a minister in the Government of India
 ”kiran bedi ne pudducheri main sthaneey nikaay chunaav ek dashak se latake rahane kaa sawaal bhi uthaaya
 Kiran Bedi said, "if CM had held the local body elections (not done for a decade), we would have got good funds for local self governance
 ye rajyon ko tabhi milte hai jab panchayat or shahari munisipalti council chunaav hote hai
 ”kiran Bedi also stressed the need to create own resources in Puducherry
 uparajyapal ne kaha, “dusron par ungali uthaane se pehle chaar or ungliyaan hamaari taraf uthati hai
 We have replaced our tourist centers and infrastructure with revenue losses due to over staffing

 The ICC has recently changed the rules: The International Cricket Council (ICC) recently changed the batting powerplay rules in ODI cricket to allow five fielders to stand out of the range of 30 yards in the last 10 overs
 
 isse pehle aakhri ke das overon main sirf chaar fielderon ko 30 gaj ke daayre ke baahar khadaa kiya ja saktaa tha
 Having trouble scoring runs due to new rules, Kohli said, "the new rules have made the batsmen's path harder than the previous rules in odis, especially in the Indian subcontinent
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki aakhri ke overon tak aate-aate gend khurdari or puraani pad jaati he or usamen waisi teji bhi nahin rahati or us par boundry hasil karnaa mushkil hota jaataa he
 "there may be ease on foreign pitches," he further said, "I think there will not be much trouble due to new rules outside the Indian sub-continent, because the five fielders in the last over overs are out of the limited scope, one run each
 It will be easy to keep changing ends

 peshey se patrkaar or research satyendra murali kaa aarope he ki notebandi kaa ekatarfa nirnay lene ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne desh kii janata ko bargalane ke liye achaanak 8 november ko raat 8 baje ghoshnaa vaala naatak kiya
 According to the journalist, on November 8, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'nation's name message' was not live, but was pre-recorded and edited
 is bhaashan ko live kahkar chalaaya janaa na sirf aniatik tha, balki desh kii janata ke saath dhokhaa bhi tha
 As a journalist in Doordarshan claims that the pm's 'message to the Nation' had been written several days before the RBI proposal at 6 pm on 8 November 2016 and briefing to the Cabinet at 7 pm
 unka aarope he ki mudra ke maamle main nirnay lene ke rigerv bank ke adhikaar kaa is maamle main spasht taur paraulalanghankia gaya he
 At the same time, Satyendra Murali alleges that on being asked about this through RTI (PMOIN / r / 2016 / 53416), the Prime Minister's Office deferred the place of reply and sent the application to the Department of Economic Affairs and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting 
 unhone iske liye baqayada RTI transfar number DOEAF / r / 2016 / 80904 or MOIAB / r / 2016 / 80180 saarvajanik he
 The journalist says that this recording was done in the PMO, so it is the responsibility of the PMO to answer it
 gauratlab he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ‘raashtra ke naam sandesh’ dete hue kaha tha ki aaj madhya raatri yani 8 november 2016 kii raatri 12 baje se vartmaan main jari 500 rupee or 1,000 rupee ke karency note legal tender nahin rahenge yani ye mudraaen kanuunan amaanya hongi
 It was claimed by the Central Government that this decision was completely confidential and before the announcement of this decision, only the Prime Minister, Finance Minister including the Reserve Bank of India and few officials of the Ministry of Finance knew about it
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne media ko bataaya ki 8 november ko shaam 6 baje arabiai kaa prastaav aayaa, shaam 7 baje cabinet kii baithak bulaai gai, jisamen modi ne mantriyon ko brif kiya or raat 8 baje pradhanmantri modi ne raashtra ko sambodhit karte hue ghoshnaa kar di
 The journalist says that PM Modi had asked to broadcast 'nation's name message' with the live band in the media, which was broadcast by all the channels of the country along with the live band
 piem modi ne desh kii janata ko bargalane ke liye aisa dikhaava kiya ki maano unhone achaanak hi raat 8 baje raashtra ko sambodhit kiya ho
 This sudden announcement was made so that the people of the country would be confident that Prime Minister Modi has taken the matter very deeply, but it was not so sure
 satyendra murali daawa kar rahe hai ki 8 november 2016 ko pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa 'raashtra ke naam sandesh' live nahin tha, balki purv recorded or edit kiya hua tha
 On November 8, 2016, the pm's 'message to the Nation' had been written several days before the RBI proposal at 6 pm and the cabinet briefed at 7 pm
 or itnaa hi nahin modi ne is bhaashan ko padhakar pehle hi record karvaa liya tha
 He has raised the question that after receiving the proposal from RBI at 6 pm on 8 November 2016, a cabinet meeting was called for a mere show at 7 pm, which was briefed by Modi
 kisi masale ko brif karnaa or us par gahan charchaa karnaa, donon main spasht antar hota he
 Modi gave his one-sided decision in the cabinet meeting without discussing it with anyone
 yah vahi nirnay tha jise piem modi pehle hi le chuke the or camere main record bhi karvaa chuke the
 In such a situation, how would the GOVERNMENT OF INDIA (TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS) RULES, 1961 and RBI Act 1934 be complied with by the Central Government? Was the President informed in this matter? Satyendra Murali alleges that Modi has misled the people of the country by following the constitution and rules and by imposing his one-sided decision, circumstances like economic emergency arise in the country
 Have done
 is nirnay kii badaulat deshbhar main bank karmiyon, bacchon, vridhon, mahilaon samet sainkadon logon kii maut ho chuki he or silsilaa he ki thamane kaa naam hi nahin le rahaa
 There are long queues outside banks and ATM machines across the country
 aaj desh kaam aadmi, garib, majdoor, kisaan evam madhyam varg se taalluk rakhane vaala vyakti in kataron main laga hua he
 While PM Modi said in his speech that a person indulging in corruption and possessing black money is today engaged in lines, while the common man, poor, laborers and farmers are sleeping peacefully
 modi ke is vaktavy kii chaaron ore jabardast aalochana bhi ho rahi he
 He said that today people all over the country are cursing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and calling him like Hitler and Tughlaq
 desh kii janata kah rahi he ki modi ne is nirnay ke bare main apane chahete, yaar-doston ko pehle hi jaankaree de di thi
 BSP national president Sister Mayawati and leaders of other opposition parties also made this point well known in the Rajya Sabha
 yahaan tak ki kai bijepi netaaon or samarthakon ne bhi piem modi par desh ke khilaaf sajeesh rachane kaa aarope lagaaya he, jiske video clip soshal media or utyub par viral ho chuke hai
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has made serious allegations in the Delhi Assembly of taking bribe on Prime Minister Modi and leaking the notice of demonetisation to his favorite bourgeoisie, friends, on which BJP and RSS have kept silence
 is sabake bich virodhabhasi baat to yah bhi he ki centre sarkaar or arabiai ne kaledhan or bhrashtachar ko rokane ke liye ucch mulya vaale 500 rupee or 1,000 rupee ke noton ko band karne kaa tark dete hue 8 november ko bharat ke rajptr main kaha he ki 'bhartiya rigerv bank ke kendriya nideshak board ne sifarish kii he ki paanch sau rupee or ek hajaar rupee ke ankit mulya ke bank note vaid mudra nahin rahenge
 It has been observed that high value banknotes are used for storing unaccounted money as reflected by large recoveries of cash by law enforcement agencies
 'lekin iske thik do din baad yani 10 november ko bazaar main 2,000 rupee kaa note aa gaya
 At the same time there is a contradiction with the above logic given by the Central Government and RBI for the closure of high denomination notes, because the central government has a high denomination of Rs 500 and more than Rs 1,000, ie Rs 2,000
 Has brought note
 itnaa hi nahin, bazaar main 2,000 rupee ke jaali noton ke alaava jammu-kashmir main maare gaye aatankwaadiyon se nae note bhi baraamad kiye ja chuke hai
 This incident has served to push the claims of the central government and now the Modi government is standing in the dock
 ek tathy yah bhi he ki arabiai ke paas 10 hajaar rupee tak ke note chhapane kii anumati he
 Earlier, under this a note of Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 notes could be printed directly above one thousand rupees, but at present the new series of Rs 2,000 notes has been printed with Gandhi's photo, then obviously related to its permission Executive orders, notifications etc
 would have been issued, but till date the public has failed to see these related executive orders, notifications, etc
 ek taraf to bhartiya rigerv bank kaa spasht rup se kahana he ki bharat kii cash aadhaarit iconomi he arthath desh ke adhiktar log cash main hi len-dein kaa kaary karte hai, vahiin duusari taraf centre sarkaar nakad len-dein ke khilaaf he or notebandi ke baad bainko se nakadi nikasi par shikanja kasate hue logon se check, atm, mobile wolet, internet banking ityadi dwaara len-dein karne ko kaha ja rahaa he
 Today the people of the country feel cheated
 meraa maananaa he ki modi dwaara liye gaye ekatarfa, pakshpaati, virodhabhasi or sandehaaspad makasad vaale is taanaashaahee nirnay kii vaidhaniktaa ko mananeey nyaayalay ke samaksh kanuunan chunauti di ja sakati he
 The PMO should comply with the RTI Act, 2005 by directly answering the RTI questions
