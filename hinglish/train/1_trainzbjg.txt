 Because, actually the Muslims were first Hindus but later they became Muslims
 "bhagwat ne ye tikhaa bayaan mangalvaar ko kolkata main sistar nivedita kii 150 veen barsi par ek program main diya
 While narrating an anecdote to a Muslim friend on the Sachar Committee, he said, "A Muslim friend told me why i oppose the Sachar Committee of the government
" musalmaan bhi kabhi hindu hi hua karte the
 But now they have become Muslims and will remain Muslims
 ham qawwali gaate hai kyonki bhajan gane kii aadat nahin gai he
 "he further said," If you call someone communal today, it would be considered abusive, but the context in which Sister Nivedita said communal was different
 bharat kii sari samasya yahi he ki bharat main bharatpan nahin he
 That is why India has to be made India
 "ramayana ko lekar bhi bhagwat bolne se nahin chuke
 He said that when the Ramayana was shown, people in Pakistan also saw it
 puri duniya use dekhati thi
 That is why India is a religion and there is spiritualism

 On 13 April 1947, Russia (then Soviet Union) and India officially decided to establish missions in Delhi and Moscow
 donon deshon ke bich shuru hua dosti kaa yah silsilaa aaj 70 saal baad bhi jari he
 Even though the proximity between the United States and India has increased at present, the reality is that Russia is India's true friend

 Earlier in the year 1961, Russia also used the 99th veto for India

 mumbai main 26 / 11 hamalon ke dauraan aatankwaadiyon se nipatane kii mumbai police kii taiyaari aadhi-adhuri thi
 This is to say the former chief of NSG and JK Dutt, commander of NSG team dealing with terrorists during Mumbai attacks
 dutt ke mutabik enesji ke pahunchane tak mumbai police ko aatankwaadiyon ko uljhaakar rakhana tha, lekin mumbai police ke paas aatankwaadiyon se nipatane kaa koi plan tak nahin tha
 According to Dutt, by the time of nsg's arrival, the Mumbai Police should have had a firm knowledge of the location and number of terrorists, but when NSG reached the spot, they had no idea what was going on inside the Taj
 saath hi aatankwaadiyon kii sankhya or unki pojishan ke bare main hi kuch nahin bataaya gaya
 There was nothing concrete in the plan which was discussed with the NSG team, due to which the operation took much time
 enesji ke purv diji ke mutabik mumbai police ke paas counter techrism tuls or aatankwaad virdohi hathiyaaron kii bhi baari kami thi
 According to Dutt, it had been 7-8 years since the terrorist attack on the Akshardham temple, so no preparation was a mistake
 apni yachika main choudhary ne daawa kiya he ki trinmul congress ke kaaryakarta panchayat chunaavon main vipakshi ummidavaaron ko aatankit karne ke liye hinsa kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 (from input language) aamasabha main jubaan phisalane ke baad vivaad khadaa hua to congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne apane 'tanch maal' vaale bayaan par safai di he
 Digvijay Singh said, 'I meant to say pure pure gold
 main minakshi natarajanji kii tarif kar rahaa tha'
 Digvijay Singh while clarifying the matter said, 'I have seen his statement on the channels, he has been misrepresented
 jo log mujhe badnaam karne kii koshish kar rah hai unke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai karuunga
 'significantly, in a public meeting, Digvijay Singh's tongue slipped such that he made objectionable remarks on the female MP of his own party
 darasal, maamla madhya pradesh ke mandsaur kaa he jahaan ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte vakt ve ilaake kii saansad minakshi natarajan par 100 tanch maal kii tippanee kar di
 In a general meeting of Mandsaur, Digvijay Singh, while describing himself as an old jeweler of politics, said, 'I know who is fake and who is right
 is kshetra kii saansad minakshi natarajan sau tanch maal he
 The controversy arose as soon as the speech came to the media
 gauratlab he ki mandsaur sansadeey kshetra se saansad minakshi natarajan ko rahul gandhi kaa behad kareebi mana jaataa he
 There was a panic inside the Congress as soon as Digvijay Singh's statement came out
 party ne digvijay singh ke is bayaan se duuri bana lee
 At the same time, the BJP shouted at the statement
 party ne kaha ki congress ke netaaon se isse behatar kii ummid bhi nahin kii ja sakati he
 The party described Digvijay Singh as mentally ill
 bijepi netaa minakshi lekhi ne kaha, 'digvijay singh maansik taur par biimaar hai
 He has the copyright to speak in hate speech
 ab desh bhi digvijay singh ko gambhirtha se nahin letaa
 ' chunaavon main lagaataar haar or kai kaddavar netaaon ke bhaajapa yaa shivasena main jane ke baad se maharashtra congress or sharad pavaar kii ensipi main halchal machi hui he
 In such a situation, the talk of ncp's merger with Congress is gaining momentum
 iske paksh main daleel di ja rahi he ki sirf sonia gandhi ke videshi mul ke hone ke chalate hi congress se nikalakar ensipi bani thi
 Apart from this, there is no difference even in the ideology and manner of both
 donon ne centre or rajya main sarkaar bhi chalaai
 At the same time, the issue of foreign origin of Sonia Gandhi has also ended
 saath hi pehle donon dal maharashtra main baraabar kii takat rakhte the, tab vilay sambhav nahin tha
 It was difficult to bring the long list of leaders and activists of both parties into one party, but now both are weak
 aise main charchaa he ki isi saal hone vaale maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav se pehle donon ekajute hokar muqabla karen to zyaada behatar rahegaa
 The Congress will get the decision of the Leader of the Opposition, the high command of the Congress and the NCP will do, but the discussion between the leaders of both the parties is in full swing that now the NCP should be merged with the Congress
 is vilay kaa suzav dene vaale netaa donon dalon main hai lekin alaakaman kaa rukh saaf hue bina khulkar bolne se batch rahe hai
 Party leaders have also prepared a proposal to enter inside, under which the merger would give NCP supremo Sharad Pawar the post of Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha
 isse vipakshi ekta ko pavaar dhar denge
 At the same time, with the merger of 5 mps of NCP in the Lok Sabha, the number of Congress members will also increase to 57 and he will also get the post of Leader of the Opposition, on which Rahul himself can compete and compete with Modi government
 ensipi ko centre main milegaa phaaydadarasal, sharad pavaar kii badhati umr ke maddenjar bhavishya main ensipi ke paas rashtriya str kaa koi cheharaa philhal nahin he
 Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar has not opted out of state politics and does not want to leave
 vahiin, abhi tak pavaar kii beti supriya sule centre kii raajnneeti main pavaar jaisaa kad bana nahin pai hai isliye agar supriya ko congress centre kii raajnneeti main achche auhade par rakhane kaa vaada kare to baat ban sakati he
 However, the high command of the two parties wants that this merger should not be imposed from above, rather, its voice should be raised from the workers below
 yahi vajah he ki is masale par netaa kuch bhi bolne se batch rahe hai or donon dalon ke alaakaman philhal dekho or intazaar karo kii niti par amal kar rahe hai
 Prithvi Singh, who was in the last minute with former soldier Ram Kishan, said in an exclusive conversation with Aaj Tak that he did not incite her to suicide

 Rajan also said before the recession, one factor can also make the market unstable
 rajan ne ucch byaaj dar ke baad kam byaaj dar ke daur ke saath anwarat ho rahe vittiya udaarikaran ko lekar polisy mekars ko chetaya tha
 But most people rejected his warning and some even mocked his idea as archaic

 Hema Malini said that the academy will run solely on charity and no profit will be made from it

 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP did tremendous social engineering in up-bihar
 bijepi ne gaiyr yadav pichhadi jatiyon ke apane paksh main lamaband kiya tha or isaki vajah se party ko hindi pattee main jabardast safalataa bhi mili thi
 But with the results of the by-elections, it seems that this equation of the BJP is now breaking
 donon rajyon main teen loksabhaa siton par up-chunaav hue or teenon par bijepi ko haar mili he
 According to the news of the Indian Express, the bjp-led NDA had won 104 Lok Sabha seats in up-bihar in the 2014 general election
 akele bijepi ne in donon rajyon main 93 siten hasil kii thim
 The NDA had won a total of 383 seats and the BJP had got 282 seats
 is jeet kii ek badi vajah yah mana gaya tha ki bijepi ne gaiyr yadav pichhadi jatiyon kaa jabardast sameekaran banaate hue ek bahut bada vot hissaa apane paale main kar liya tha
 The BJP had taken care of the emergence of the Yadavs in this class of coopi-bihar and some backward castes of these states felt neglected due to the domination of some people while in power
 bijepi ne hindutv, saamaajik samarasata or rashtrawaad jaise naaron ko jor-shor se uchhaalate hue is varg main apni acchhee paith bana lee
 In the 2014 elections, BJP fielded one-third of its candidates from non-yadav OBC castes in UP
 isi prakaar bihar main bhi bijepi ne aisi paith kaayam kii thi or nitish kumaar ke saath aane ke baad aisa mana jaataa rahaa tha ki uskaa yah sameekaran or majboot hua he
 But the results of the three Lok Sabha elections in both the states have indicated that the bjp's equation is crumbling and it has suffered a major blow from the SP-BSP alliance in UP
 duusari taraf bihar main in virgon main lalu prasad ke rashtriya janata dal ne acchhee sendhamari kii he
 non-yadav, winner of both seats Gorakhpur (praveen Nishad) and Phulpur (nagendra Patel) in UP come from the OBC community
 phulpur main sapa ke kurmi candidet ne bijepi ke kurmi candidet par hi vijay darj kii he
 This seat is considered OBC dominated
 yah is baat kaa saaf sanket he ki ek hi samudaay ke do candidet hone par bhi logon ne sapa ke kurmi ummidavaar ko chunanaa munasib samajha
 Similarly in Gorakhpur, sp's winner candidate Praveen Kumar traditionally comes from the Nishad community associated with fisheries
 yah samudaay purvi upi ke nadiyon ke kinare sthit gaanvon-kasbon main badi sankhya main rahata he
 It is believed that about 3 in Gorakhpur parliamentary seat
 5 lakh nishad voter hai
 It is also believed that this community voted for the BJP during the 2017 assembly elections
 lekin is baar nishad samudaay yogi adityanathhindutvake aahvaan se prabhavit nahin hua
 Not only this, non-yadav OBC voters in Bihar also did not support BJP this time
 is maamle main usko is baar pichhadi jatiyon kii aadhaar vaali party jediu ke saath kaa bhi koi phayda nahin mila
 In Araria, bjp's non-yadav OBC Nishad community candidate Pradeep Kumar Singh was defeated by RJD candidate Sarafaraj Alam
 pashchim bengal main jari mamata banerjee vs sibiai ke hivoltage drame ke bich bhaajapa ne bengal sarkaar par karaara hamalaa bolaa he or mamata banerjee(mamta Banerjee) par bhrashtachariyon ko bachaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 BJP leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the Supreme Court had directed a CBI inquiry into the case
 court ne yah bhi kaha tha ki sibiai is baat kii bhi jaanch karegi ki isamen koun-koun se log shaamil hai
 He said that Rahul Gandhi had tweeted on 8 May 2014 that 20 lakh people lost their money in the chit fund scam, but they are seeing what they are saying today and what they were saying then
 is maamle main yachikakarta left or congress ke samarthak the
 The Sharda scam is before our coming to power
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki is ghotaale main tiemasi ke kaddavar netamadan mitra giraftaar hue, sudeep bandopadhyaay giraftaar hue or kai maheene jail main rahe
 Two mps were also arrested
 iske baavjood mamata ne koi tippanee nahin kii
 After all, what is the matter in the police commissioner Rajeev Kumar that Mamta sat on a dharna
 aisi sandehaaspad sthiti he ki lagata he ki raajadaar bahut kuch jaanata he or raajadaar ko bachaana jaruri he
 He said that TMC has been misinformed
 sibiai ne police kamishnar kotin baar saman bheja tha
 The investigating agency has the power to call someone for questioning
 teen baar saman gaya lekin ve pesh nahin hue
 Made different excuses every time
 jab sibiai ne dijipi se kaha ki hamaari madad kariye to police kii ore se kaha gaya ki adhiktar jaanch adhikari yaa to ritair ho gaye yaa duusari jagah posted hai
 The CBI then sought further details, but was not given
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki is maamle main ek or rochak baat he
 When there was pressure again and again, we were told that we had a meeting
 yah koi tamaasha he kya? baar-baar kaha ja rahaa he ki sibiai bina warrant ke kaise chale ai, lekin yah nahin bataaya ja rahaa he ki pehle teen baar saman ke baavjood police kamishnar pesh kyon nahin hue
 Police have the power to arrest without warrant
 unhone kaha ki hamaara spasht aarope he ki mamata banerjee swayan or unki sarkaar bhrasht logon ko bachaa rahi he, taaki ghotaale kii jaanch na ho sake
 There is a lot of apprehension that a large number of evidence was either destroyed or tampered with when Rajiv Kumar was the head of the SIT
 prasad ne kaha ki gathbandhan ke jitne sipaahi hai ve kahin na kahin jaanch ke daayre main hai
 Rahul Gandhi is also on bail
 hakeekat kisi se chhipi nahin he
 We clearly say that Mamata Banerjee is nervous about the growing power of BJP in Bengal
 piem kii jabardast sabha hui
 Our leaders are not getting permission for the rally
 piem ke kaarykram ko nahin roak sakate hai, to unke sabhasthal kii jagah ko hi chota kar diya
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the whole country saw what happened in the panchayat elections in Bengal
 iske baavjood badlaav kii bayaar bah rahi he
 Mamta is presenting herself as the leader of the alliance, but what will happen to Mayawati and Rahul
 iske alaava bhi kai chote-bade netaa hai
 Investigation agency should not bow down in front of corruption
 saath hi bhaajapa ke kaaryakarta bhi nahin jhukenge
 We stand with our workers
 mamata banerjee ne yah pehali baar nahin kiya he
 She has said earlier that i do not believe in the Indian Army
 ro kii aalochana kar chuki hai

 It is obvious that this act of murderers is highly condemnable but the big question is also why Delhi is so shameless? Despite repeatedly telling why Delhiites urinate in the open

 First reason: it is necessary to change the mindset of the people
 Actually one of the big reasons behind this is the mindset of the people
 peshaab aane par logon ko jahaan jagah milti he wo vahiin gaadi roak dete hai
 No one bothers to wait a bit and use any public toilet to come forward
 duusari vajah: public toilets kii kameeis maamle main sirf logon kii maansikta ko hi dosha nahin diya ja saktaa balki isamen ek badi vifaltaa civik agenciyon kii bhi he
 There is a shortage of public toilets in Delhi, on the other hand, most public toilets are such that they are so dirty that people cannot use them even if they want to
 public toilets kaa rakrakhaav bhi thik nahin he
 Due to which their condition is getting worse
 emsidi kaa tarknarth dilli kii meyar priti agarwal kaa kahana he ki logon kii maansikta ko badalanaa behad jaruri he

 Not only this, the crisis in the party has deepened after the open statement of a former Congress MLA
 ye donon maamle party ko congress kii madad se satta nashin karne ke bare main hai
 They show how anxious the party had become to power before the February elections and were willing to compromise and buy Congress legislators by following their principles
 yah party siddhanton or usulon main yakeen rakhane vaale logon kaa ek bada manch bana jisamen desh hi nahin duniya ke kone-kone se logon ne shirkat kii
 There are also many who put their lucrative jobs on hold and started doing party work for the sake of principles
 lekin ab yah bhram tuutata dikh rahaa he
 In the quest for mutual discord and superiority, some leaders have been trying to bring others down
 nateeja saamne he
 There is chaos outside and inside the party
 janata hi nahin patibaddh kaaryakarta bhi sawaal puch rahe hai
 Meanwhile, another founder Anjali Damania has also left the party
 unhen maharashtra kaa kejariwal kaha jaataa he
 He is hurt by the infighting in the party and the events of hoisting the cap
 unke alaava saikadon kaaryakarta bhi party chhodane ko taiyaar hai
 If this happens then it is no wonder that the party will remain a gathering of a handful of leaders
 agar dhyaan se dekha jaae to ham paaenge ki party ne ve sabhi kaam kiye jiskaa aarope usne dusron par madha tha
 All manner of tactics were adopted to bring the party back to power
 usne bijepi par vidhayakon ko kharidne kii koshish kaa aarope lagaaya tha lekin ab pataa chal rahaa he ki vah khud hi is game main thi

 The names of his activists also came up in some incidents of assault, but the party kept blaming them all with great precision
 yani usamen ek aam raajnneetik dal ke tamaam avagun dikhne lage
 But Arvind Kejriwal kept hiding them all very clearly
 ab jabaki kai maamle ek saath saamne aane lage hai arvind kejariwal kii anupasthiti logon ko khaskar unke samarthakon ko khatakane lagi he
 It is not that he cannot make a statement, but he knows that a silence is equal to a thousand sentences
 or yah samay aisa he ki galatabayani ulte gale pad sakati he
 In this case, he likes to keep quiet

 He was once seen at a rally with the diaspora at Madison Square Garden or was seen calling on industrialists to "make in India", taking a selfie outside a polling station in the blink of an eye or children on Teachers' Day
 Showed sharing knowledge
 beete saal yah shaks har jagah chaaya rahaa-narendra modi 2014 kaa paryaay he
 The self-proclaimed Modi, with a clenched fist and an alleged 56-inch chest, had become the defining symbol of an India that was desperate to get rid of a troubled elite called the UPA
 munh main chaandi kaa chammach lekar paidaa hue khandaani raison or puraane sattadhari kulinon ke khilaaf uski dahaad puri duniya main gunj rahi thi
 From Amethi to Chennai and from Bastar to Kerala, every public presence of this man with tremendous energy riding the aspirations was a call for the overthrow of the old regime, in which a "chaiwala" stood out from his body Begging to boast of the past, "if i can, why don't you!" Those on the war against educated elites from Oxford and Cambridge This section of the enemy is also a friend of indigenous businessmen and capitalists
 vah hindutv kaa nayak he lekin apane saath atyaadhunik or ucch-takanic vaala media lekar chalata he
 It is one such mass-supported symbol of globalized India, whose victorious eyes rest on the Vedic era
 beshak, is desh kii satta aaj us diziner kurte se nikal rahi he jo kabhi gujarat main sila gaya tha
 It was a cold evening of December last when Rashtrapati Bhavan organized the inauguration of the new wing of its Ceremonial Hall
 lutian kii dilli ke saare asardaar sattadhish yahaan maujuud theah mantriyon, rajyapalon se lekar sena pramukhon or khud raashtrapati tak
 As soon as the time of the clock reached the appointed time, the Prime Minister walked in his trademark churidar-kurta
 kamare main chal rahi chater-patar achaanak sannaate main tabdeel ho gai
 The vips gathered there began to shudder to come into the eyes of this great man
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki 2014 main modi vishaal shakhsiyat ke taur par ubhare hai
 Barring Indira Gandhi in the seventies, for the first time after witnessing a two-and-a-half decade long period under coalition governments, India has become the witness of its most powerful Prime Minister who has come with an overwhelming majority
 yah tasviir hameshaa se aisi nahin thi
 Modi first appeared on the cover of the magazine in 2002
 unhen tab ‘‘master divyder’’ kaha gaya tha, ek aisa netaa jisane apni naak ke neeche gujarat main bhayaavah sampradayik dangon ko hone diya tha jisamen 1,000 se zyada log maare gaye the
 At the time, he emerged as a fast-paternal divider: to his critics he was a dictator like Hitler who did not deliberately prevent the killing of innocent Muslims
 apane samarthakon ke liye ve ‘‘hindu hriday samraat’’ the, aisa nayak jisane godhra main train jalaane kii ghatana ke baad bahusankhyak samudaay kii raksha kii thi jisamen 56 karsevak maare gaye the
 The Congress leadership called him a "merchant of death" and his own people honored him with the title of "lion of Gujarat"
 isse pehle kabhi kisi shaks ne janamat ko itani safai se nahin baanta tha
 Walk back a little more
 1990 kaa dashak tha
 Modi was busy trying to climb the political ladder
 congress ke prabhutv ko chunauti dene kii disha main dhire-dhire ubhar rahi bijepi ke bheetar ve kabhi bhi party kii agali peedi ke netaaon main nahin the
 Then there was the era of Pramod Mahajan, who used to be the right-hand man and chief strategist of the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 tab sushamaa swaraj prachaar ke maidan main bijliyaan giraati thim, to vichaardhaara kii kaman govindacharya ke kushal haathon main thi
 As a campaigner who has never contested an election and who has no experience in governance
 modi kisi bhi anya sanghee prachaarak kii hi tarah parade ke peeche rahete the
 Yes, the clothes used to be flashy even at that time
 ve tivi par party pravaktaa kii haisiyat se prabhaavshaalee vaktavy dete the or laalkrishna adwani tathaa murali mohar joshi kii yatraaon ke dauraan jabardast santhnik kushalta dikhaa chuke the
 Despite this, he was never in the front row of potential successors of the vajpayee-advani duo
 phir bhi unhen khud par bharosa tha, ek drudh sankalp ki ve mahaan kaaryon ke liye hi bane hai
 Normally, Sangh campaigners have to suppress their personal ambitions due to total dedication to the organization, but Modi was different in this matter
 samaaj main aresas kaa sandesh failaane ko lekar duusare prachaarkon kii tarah unke bheetar kisi kapol-kalpit adarsh kaa vaas nahin tha
 He was an essential part of the ruthless politics of this world and was also desperate to become the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 ho saktaa he, unke man main kisi din pradhanmantri banane kii khwaahish bhi rahi hogi
 He had no illusions about his purpose — he was a loyal activist devoted to the bjp's rise, but he was also a fiercely individualist, a stalwart player of grassroots politics who would not hesitate to pin down his political rival
 
 is baat ko kisi or se kahin zyada behatar tareeke se sangh samajhataa tha jisaki shakhaon main modi kaa paalan-poshan hua tha
 Perhaps this may have been the reason that on some occasions within the Sangh Parivar there has been hesitation in the matter of returning its due to this pracharak of Vadnagar
 masalan, modi ke samarthakon ke ek samooh ne 2008 main jab sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat se apil kii ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri ko rashtriya str par zyada jimmedaariyaan saunpi jaaen, to bhagwat (jo us samay sangh main duusare number par the) kaa jawaab yah thah ‘‘ham unhen pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar to bana sakate hai, lekin kisi din aisa na ho ki ve sarasanghachaalak banane kii ichha paal baithen!’’ modi se nibatane ke maamle main hameshaa se bhay or vismay kaa ek mishrit bhav maujuud rahaa he or is dwandv ko sulajhaa paanaa itnaa aasaan nahin rahaa he
 Modi's dark side as the flag bearer of the divisive politics of Hinduism was inaugurated by the circumstances of 2002 and beyond, another aspect of his image emerged in the years that followed
 hindutv ke nayak se sushasan guru ke chole main modi kaa pravesh suniyojit or ranneetik to tha hi, lekin iske peeche kaaphi kadi mehnat or khud ko durust karne kii lagaataar chali aa rahi talash bhi thi
 When he took over as the Chief Minister of Gujarat in October 2001, he himself admitted that he had never sat in any government office or touched government files
 haa, safal hone kaa sankalp unke man main jarur tha
 He created an image as a "karmayogi" leader who could work closely with the bureaucracy for effective and grassroots management of government programs: electricity for 24 hours, girls' education, irrigation schemes, etc
 modi ne apane netritv main rajya ke prashasan ko pariyojna sanchalit sakasham mashin main tabdeel kar diya tha
 Modi's political career actually had two turning points
 pehla godhra main train kaa jalaayaa janaa or uske baad hue dange the, jab rajya prashasan kii naakaami ke liye unhone khed jataane yaa pashchaatap karne se inkaar kar diya or is tarah unki ek vishisht rajnatik pahchaan bani
 The second defining moment came on October 7, 2008, when the Tata group announced that it would set up a Nano plant in Sanand, Gujarat
 plant ko bengal se gujarat laane kaa faisla modi ko vah vastu de gaya jo unhen 2002 yaa ek ke baad ek mili chunavi jeet bhi nahin de saki thi-ek bharosemand prashaasak ke rup main vishwasaneeyata
 This was the turning point when Modi's ambitions ballooned across the border of Gujarat
 dangon ne unhen siyaasi rup se akelaa chhod diya tha; tata se mila vishwaas behad sammanit korporate naagarik se mili manyata bhi thi jisane unamem yah aatmavishvaas foonka ki unke khilaaf uthi lahar ab laut chuki he
 Then he started promoting himself as a leader committed to good governance through a flamboyant public relations media that cannot be corrupted and which is the driver of the "gujarat model" with high growth and solid infrastructure
 Used to be
 is kaam ko aise anjaam diya gaya ki gujarat model or modi kalt ek-duusare ke paryaay ban jaaen
 (modi addressing supporters at Modison Square Garden, New York) Good Governance Guru This was the same period when Modi moved out of the realm of traditional "hindu" voters and found a new home for his supporters: he now finds himself as the hero of that community Started establishing what they call the "new middle class"
 modi ke liye yah ‘‘nayaa madhyavarg’’ congress ke ‘‘aam aadmi’’ kaa jawaab tha jise 2014 ke chunaavon se pehle unke naaron ke centre main hona tha
 Modi called this population "india full of expectations", an India that is restless for better life and prosperity
 vidambnaa dekhie ki yahi vah varg tha jise 1991 main narsinghraav-manmohan singh ke shuru kiye gaye mahaan aarthik udaarikaran kaa phayda mil chukaa tha
 Singh changed the economy, but he did not understand enough about the political turmoil that resulted from it
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki 1991 main hue mahaan badlaav ne jis raajnneeti ko janm diya, use congress se behatar modi ne aatmsaat kiya
 Liberalization has given birth to such a generation of young Indians for whom the basic criteria of better living have been earned and social and material progress has been made
 yah maansikta license-permit raaj ke daur ke unke baap-dadaon kii peedi se bilkul juda he jinaki mahatvakankshaayen sarkari naukariyon or academik yogyata ke ird-gird mandaraati thim
 In this rapidly changing and urbanized India, Modi was instinctively raising hopes for this section, as seen in his election slogan of "achhe Din Aayenge"
 phir isamen koi andeh nahin ki 2014 ke chunaavon main bijepi ko sabase zyada samarthan pehali baar vot dene vaale yuvaaon or ‘‘yuva’’ bharat se milaah siesds kaa adhyayan dikhaata he ki 18 se 25 saal kii umr ke bich 42 fisadi bhartiya yuva modi ko apana pradhanmantri dekhnaa chaahate the jabaki 16 fisadi aise the jinaki pasand rahul gandhi the
 It is more interesting that in the 2014 elections, a 64-year-old leader was the first choice of younger voters than his main rival 20 years younger than himself
 modi yuvaaon ke saath lagaataar samvaad main dikhte the or unki bhaawanaaon se judate the, chaahe ve college parisaron main tounhall sabhaaon ko sambodhit kar rahe hon yaa phir apni sanchaar team ke sahare twitor or fasebuk jaisi soshal media websiton par maujuud hon
 The only thing that can be said about Rahul is that he did not miss any opportunity to lose the opportunity
 unka na to fasebuk acount he or na hi koi twitor khaataa
 Of course, for supporting his "mission 272" project, Modi should send a card thanking Rahul on this new year, but Manmohan Singh still gets a greeting card
 purv pradhanmantri or sonia gandhi ke tainaat kiye vajeer manmohan singh ek mridubhashi vidwaan the jo lagaataar aarope lagaate media, maang karte nagarikon or javabdehi ke naaron se chautarafa ghire hue apni noummidi main kshitij ko nihaar rahe the
 In the face of ever increasing allegations of corruption against his ministers, this good chieftain imposed such a long silence that it created an image that he has succumbed to the ground and there is virtually no Prime Minister in the country
 sabase zyada aabaadi vaale uttar pradesh ko dekhie to vahaan akhilesh yadav abhi rajkaaj kii jatiltaaon se nibatane main sangharsh hi kar rahe the or raajnneeti ke maidan main ve kachche khilaadi the
 In an important state like Maharashtra, Ajit Pawar's infamous "pee in peasants' dams" was an indication of the moral bankruptcy of the ruling gang, which was labeled as "national Corrupt Party"
 manishankar ayyar ne chywala par die apane gaiyr-jimmedaarana bayaan se congress ke hi post main gol daag diya jisaki vajah se bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ko badi aasaani se yah mauka haath lag gaya ki ve apni hasil kii gai uplabdhiyon ke bainks raaj karne ke liye paidaa hue abhijatya tabake ko khaarij kar pate
 a vote of thanks should also be sent to the media, a large part of which was a cheerleader in Modi's game
 modi tivi yug ke netaa haih ve jabardast vaktaa hai, unka camera prem jagajaahir he or ve turant yah jaan lete hai ki kya cheez ‘‘khabar’’ banegi
 In this era of contemporary public debates created with soundbite, Modi used the media, especially TV, fiercely and established himself as a leader steeped in strong ideas that could rid the country of filth and corruption
 
 media ke liye modi tiarapy kaa sabab the or aisa lagata tha ki bijepi kaa yah shubhankar hamaari jindagi kii har harakat par kabja kar chukaa he
 Whatever the media, Modi's picture used to be there
 modi kaa chunaav prachaar apane aap main vilakshan thah isamen media, dhan or praudyogiki kaa aisa sangam tha jisane vipaksh ko vastav main hairat main daal diya
 For example, Modi in 3D showed how cutting-edge technology can be used to spread Modi's message everywhere; Missed calls and smss proved how cell phones could be used to create a military force; The video chariots that suddenly arrived in the "media away" villages of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar bridged the gap between the city and the village
 or yah sara khel sirf ek aadmi ke bas kaa nahin tha
 The team behind this was Modi, in which young, technocrats supporters were present, whose command was more in the hands of the more Khanty and clever leader Amit Shah
 duusari ore aresas ke ve kaaryakarta the jo ghar-ghar jaakar prachaar kar rahe the, kyonki satta kii pyaas bujhane kii chaah main unke liye yah chunaav jivan or maran kaa sawaal ban chukaa tha
 The truth is that the media did not create the Modi wave
 vah sirf us lahar par savaar tha
 This wave (which Shah called tsunami or sunmo) was the product of a political atmosphere in which bad growth, inflation, heavy corruption, etc
 created a sense of negativity and even sent a sense of hopelessness in the minds of voters
 matadaataaon ko arnold ‘‘vargenegar jaise kisi aise termineter (mahamanav) kii talash thi jo desh kii samasyaon ko jaadu kii chadi ghuma thik kar detaa
 (modi launching Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in New Delhi on Gandhi Jayanti) a study that took place after the tsunami election showed that one in every four people who voted for BJP, 27 percent said that they voted for Modi

 a senior Congress leader had said, "this leader has come at the right time, right place and right perspective
" ’’narendra damodaradaas modi ko 26 may, 2014 ko bharat ke 15wein pradhanmantri ke rup main shapath dilaai gai
 This was the oath of Chief Executive of the first stable Hindu nationalist government in the country
 yah vaajapeyinith endie jaisi gathbandhan kii sarkaar nahin thi; endie-2 bijepi kii sarkaar thi jahaan gathbandhan sahyogiyon ko, yahaan tak ki shivasena jaise puraane sahyogiyon ko bhi bijepi netritv ke aage ghutane techne pade the
 This ceremony itself had a Modi-like name
 ise paramparaagat rup se darbar haul main nahin balki raashtrapati bhawan ke baahar yojit kiya gaya thah yah samaaroh ek ‘‘bahari’’ ke aagaman or nae dilli darbar kii munaadi ke liye kiya ja rahaa tha
 Modi has always been the best coordinator: his oath ceremony was also a planned event
 pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif samet pehali baar dakshes deshon ke netaaon kii vahaan maujuudagi halchal paidaa karne ke uddeshy se thi taaki nae pradhanmantri ko kathith mashîr netaa ke taur par pesh kiya ja sake
 The officials of the Ministry of External Affairs were not aware of this plan till the last moment
 vishuddh modi style main ve samooche satta pratishthan ko ekbargi hilaa dena chaahate the
 He takes pride in his "outsider" image, a man who refuses to be bound by the Lutyens' rules and laws and formalities of Delhi; a person who is so different that even his family is not invited to attend the oath ceremony
 america main unhone ek baar phir shoman kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa or medicin skhwaayar ko pravasi bharatiyon ke premotsav main badal daalaa; ve central park main chal rahe sangeet samaaroh tak main chale gaye, hollywood ke hero hew jaikaman ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milaayaa or bheed kaa abhivadan bilkul sattar ke dashak vaali star wars style main kiya, ‘‘me da force bi vid you’’ (sarvasatta aapke saath ho)
 After the riots, if America did not give Modi a visa for many years, then Modi too was determined not to let it come in the way of becoming a global leader
 (swatantraaa diwas par bacchon se mukhaatib modi)svachh chhavimodi prime time par surkhiyaan batorne vaale ek line ke naare (jaise unka bhrashtachar virdohi naaraa na khaauungaa na khaane duungaa) gande main maahir hai, khud ko preranadai vyaktitvon (kabhi sardaar patel, to kabhi vivekanand) se jodpha pasand karte hai or aise saral kintu maun vichaaron ko bazaar main phenkna pasand karte hai, jinhen lokapriyata milane kaa unhen bharosa hota he
 His speech on Independence Day was a different demonstration, not a traditional message to the nation
 unhone yojana ayog ko mitaane or shauchalay banane ke nae mishan kaa vaada kiya
 His statement was enough to tickle the country, "what kind of a Prime Minister is this, who stands on the Red Fort and talks about building toilets?" The message has to be sent to every corner
 upie sarkaar bhi swatchta ke liye nirmal bharat abhiyaan chalaa rahi thi
 Jairam Ramesh, who was the minister in charge, expressed regret at the Aaj Tak agenda conclave, saying, "we even made actress Vidyabalan a brand ambassador, but we did not know how to sell it like Modi ji
" ’’ modi kii nitiyaan kitni hi udhaar kii kyon na lagen, unke aalochak bhi maanate hai ki modi kaa samvaad kaushal gajab kaa he
 Mahatma Gandhi's grandson Rajmohan Gandhi says that this divine quality was also in the Mahatma
 unhone haal hi main kaha, ‘‘bada fark yahi he ki baapu ke liye sandesh sabase ahm tha, jabaki modi hameshaa khud ko aage rakhane ko aatur rahete hai
 "in fact, after every election, it is becoming more clear that in the arena of Indian politics, Modi is on one side and the rest in the other
 unke ghoshit shatru lalu yadav or nitish kumaar bhi modi ke rath ko bihar ko raundne se rokane ke liye saath aane par majaboor hue hai
 Modi is the glue that clings to the desperate opposition, just as the dominance of Indira Gandhi in the 1970s mixed the slang of the Janata Party
 congress abhi tak chunavi haar ko gatak nahin pai he
 Therefore the opposition's food is empty
 pashchim bengal main apane garh main aatankit mamata banerjee ko hi vipaksh kaa paracham uthaanaa pad rahaa he, jisase pataa chalata he ki modi raaj ke virodh main rajnatik bahes kaa pehla sutara apana bachaav karnaa he
 By strengthening the position of BJP President to his trusted soldier Amit Shah, Modi has strengthened the party
 puraane diggajon ko maardarshak mandal main samet diya he or saathiyon ke paas modi kii param satta ke saamne ghutane techne ke sivaae koi chaara nahin he
 Even though the lotus could not bloom in the Kashmir Valley in 2014, the way the Modi and Shah duo conceded Mission 44 in the Jammu and Kashmir elections, their intention to remain in mind and heart at all times would have been evident

 modi ke samarthak chaahe kitni bhi koshish kar len ve abhi chakravarti samraat nahin ho paae hai
 The silence of Modi, a politician who has continued to speak on the slogans of Hindu extremists like Love Jihad and conversion, is worrying
 iske kaaran alpsankhyakon ke saath vishwaas kii khai or chaudee ho jaati he
 (he broke the tradition and flatly refused to attend the Prime Minister's annual Iftar feast and wear hats, while wearing other types of attire easily)
 ve abhi tak koi bada aarthik yaa sansthagat sudhaar nahin kar paae hai, menuphaccharing main nai jaan nahin ai he, sansad main gatirodh bhi nahin tod paae hai or centre rajya sambandhon jaise ahm muddon kaa samaadhaan bhi nahin hua he
 Modi's relationship with the Sangh is also unclear
 kya shaktishaalee pradhanmantri parivaar ke niyantran main he? kya sarkaar ke sabhi faisle pehle sangh kii sweekaaryata kii kasuti par kase jaaenge? kya jis aresas ne modi ko banaaya he, vahi hindu raashtra ke shor se unki sarkaar kii naak kaa bal sabit hoga? jab ummiden is kadar buland ho jaaen ki aasmaan chune lagen or phir puri na hon to aalochakon ko chup nahin karaayaa ja saktaa

 2015 could be the year of the administrator, in which promises have to be fulfilled
 matadaata ne modi ko tivi, soshal media or thridi main dekha he, ab vah unhen jite-jaagate insaan ke rup main dekhnaa chahega

 This is the meter of the encounter during the Yogiraj in UP, which is telling that the state police has taken the command of the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's encounter with respect
 upi police kaa oparation ''thok do'' itnaa charchaa main he ki ab sanyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar ne bhi is par sawaal uthaa die he
 Not only this, now even the Supreme Court has turned its eyes on this right and issued a notice to the UP government and sought a reply from the Yogi government
 lihaaza ab sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya upi main hue encounter farzi the?to kya yogiraj main hue encounter farzi the? to kya aparaadhiyon ko jaanboojhkar banaaya gaya nishaanaa? maare gaye aparaadhiyon ko kyon nahin kiya gaya giraftaar? ye sawaal ab soobe kii sarhad ko paar kar adaalat kii dahleez tak aa gaya he
 Because ever since Yogiraj came in UP, more than 13 hundred encounters have taken place
 59 aparaadhiyon kii maut ho gai
 327 criminals were injured and 3,124 criminals either arrested or surrendered
 shaayad isiilie ye sawaal uth rahe hai ki jin aparaadhiyon ko maaraa gaya kya unhen zindaa nahin pakadaa ja saktaa tha
 Just this thing of Yogi was taken seriously by the policemen of the state
 or aise danaadan encounter kiye ki vipakshiyon ko kahana hi padaa ki ye yogiraj nahin balki encounter raaj he
 Apart from this, United Nation Human Right also questioned the encounter in UP
 lihaaza itane aaropon ke baad ab supreme court ne upi sarkaar ko encounter ke silsile main notice jari kar di he
 Indeed, a PIL has been filed in the court questioning these encounters
 jisamen is baat kii maang kii gai he ki upi main hui police muthbhedon kii adaalat kii nigaraanee main sibiai yaa esaiti se jaanch karai jaae
 Therefore, while giving the order on the PIL, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said - this is a serious matter which requires a detailed hearing
 ab is maamle main 12 farvari ko sunwaayee hogi
 In fact, opponents of these encounters in UP were constantly raising questions that the police of the state were carrying out fake encounters to please their political masters
 agar sahi maaene main aparaadhiyon ko safaya hota to pradesh main log bina khauf ke ji rahe hote
 So the NCRB figures are also revealing the claims of the UP government
 kuch din pehle upi police kii kuch tasviren saamne ai thim
 When a CO Sahab visited the police station, he found that the policemen do not know how to fire a gun
 pistal lod kaise karte hai pataa nahin
 Who would remember the names of weapons? upar se goli or aansu gas ke gole kii expagori date kab nikal gai yaad hi nahin
 Now what would you expect from the UP police in such a situation? You can only say that Yogi ji's police is really amazing
 ab koi bura naa maan jaae to lage haath ye bhi bataa den ki upi police kii itani sari kabalidat kii pole-pattee koi or nahin balki khud upi police hi khol rahi he
 This happened not once, but again and again
 jab mauka aayaa to bandook chali hi nahin
 However these are also government guns
 ab baat un tasveeron kii jo alag-alag encounter ke baad saamne ai
 Isn't it awesome? On one hand, the UP government guns did not work, and then suddenly the same guns are being fired
 ugale bhi kyon naa? jab trigar par oongli yogi ke farmaan kii ho or encounter sarkari aadesh to goliyaan to chalengi hi
 The question is: why suddenly there was an encounter in UP? Has the law system broken down in UP so much that there is no way other than an encounter? Have the criminal in UP become so uninspired that they suddenly become a threat to the entire society? Did the UP police become so helpless that it could not control crime? Or the government has chosen the easiest way to end the crime, then end the criminal itself
 par kya ye rasta sahi he? kya upi kii kanoon vyavastha ko sudhaarney ke liye encounter hi ekmaatr rasta or aakhri hathiyaar he? agar haa, to phir jab tak ye encounter jari he, tab tak ke liye kyon naa upi kii tamaam adaalaton par taala laga dena chahie? vaise bhi adaalaton kii jagah insaaf to ab sadak par hi ho rahaa he
 That too with bullets
 hindustan kaa pehla encounterencounter yani muthbhed shabd kaa istemaal hindustan or pakistan main beesvin sadi main shuru hua
 An encounter directly means a police encounter with miscreants
 haalanki bahut se log encounter ko sarkari qatl bhi kehete hai
 The first encounter in India took place on 11 January 1982 at Mumbai's Wadala College, when a special team of Mumbai Police shot six bullets to gangster Manya Surve
 kehete hai ki police goli maarane ke baad use gaadi main daal kar tab tak mumbai kii sadakon par ghumaati rahi, jab tak ki wo mar nahin gaya
 After this he was taken to the hospital
 azaad hindustan kaa ye pehla encounter hi vivaadon main ghir gaya tha
 All the encounters in Uttar Pradesh raise the question that each of these encounters was done by declaring the declaration
 sutron ke mutabik upi estf or tamaam zila police ko baqayada ghoshit aparaadhiyon kii list bheji gai or usee list ke hisaab se upi main encounter jari hai
 Well, it is not known whether it would be coincidental or something that Yogi Adityanath himself had to seek protection for himself from UP government and UP police
 wo bhi sansad bhawan ke andar
 He then cried foul, saying that the UP government was implicating him in false criminal cases
 lekin ab vakt badal chukaa he
 Now the same Yogi is the head of the UP government and the UP police is under him
 ab sangrakshan koi or maang rahaa he

 ' somvaar ko bihar bijepi ke adhyaksh nityanand raay ne ek vivaadaaspad bayaan diya tha jisamen unhone party kaaryakartaaon se kaha tha ki jo bhi vyakti pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa virodh kare uske haath or ungliyaan tod do yaa phir virodh karne vaale ke haath or ungliyaan kaat do
 Within 24 hours, former Chief Minister Rabri Devi responded to the controversial statement of Nityananda Rai by giving another controversial statement
 argedy ke rashtriya parishad kii meeting ke dauraan rabari devi ne nityanand raay ke vivaadaaspad bayaan kaa jawaab dete hue kaha ki bihar main aise kai log hai jo pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa galaa or haath kaatane ke liye taiyaar he
 Rabri challenged the BJP and said that if any leader has courage, he should show the hand or finger of any person in Bihar
 rabari ne kaha kiagar kisi bhi bhaajapa ke netaa ne ungali yaa haath kaatane kii jurrat kii to bihar ke log chup nahin baithenge or vah pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa galaa or haath kaat denge
 In fact, Rabri Devi's displeasure was that she has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate continuously for the past several days and is being called to inquire into the Delhi Auckerway Tender Scam but while addressing the meeting of the National Council Rabri declared that she would not go to Delhi at any cost
 unhone kaha ki agar kisi bhi jaanch agency ko unase poochtacha kerani he to vah patna aakar unke nivas par unase poochtacha kar saktaa he
 Attacking the central government, Rabri Devi said that Lalu Prasad Yadav and his son Tejashwi Yadav are being implicated in false cases of corruption but said that he and his family are not afraid of the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate

 He also saw Bharti standing there

 Instant messaging app whatsapp is the most used platform in the world
 bharat main ye khaskar zyada popular he
 You can say that India is the world's best market for whatsapp
 yahaan whatsapp ke lagbhag 200 million yugers hai
 1 of whatsapp worldwide
 5 arab se bhi zyada yugers hai
 The way to launch a payment service for whatsapp in India is now clearly visible
 kaaphi samay se company bharat main whatsapp Pay kii testing kar rahi he, lekin date loklijeshan jaisi vajahon se ministry main baat tak bani nahin thi
 According to the report, whatsapp has agreed on data localization and now whatsapp has got the green signal for testing whatsapp Pay with more users
 whatsapp Pay se kaa bharat main sabase bada rivel Paytm hoga
 Paytm is the most used digital payment platform in India
 aise main agar whatsapp petm jaisi hi sarvice lekar aata he to nishchit taur par donon companiyon main yugers ko lekar kaante kii takkar dekhne ko milegi
 Paytm CEO and Founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma has raised questions about whatsapp Pay many times
 unhone kaha tha ki pement ke liye watsap sickyor nahin he
 He accused Facebook of saying that Facebook has come back into the game after failures like free basic tricks in India
 Paytm kii baat karen to, report ke mutabik company ke paas 230 million customers hai or petm popular bhi he
 Gradually many services have come on Paytm
 aise main watsap ke liye bhi petm ko takkar dena itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Because whatsapp is a chat-based app and payment related features like Paytm will obviously not be available on whatsapp
 haalanki exparts kaa maananaa he ki log watsap pe ko bhi pasand karenge
 Not only common users but small businessmen will also use whatsapp payment
 aapako bataa den ki whatsapp bijness kaaphi pehle se hi aa chukaa he or haal hi main fasebuk ne watsap par hi product katalog kaa opshan dene kaa elaan kiya he
 That is, small businessmen can sell their products through whatsapp
 aise main bijness main bhi watsap pement phydemand ho saktaa he
 Not only Paytm but also Amazon and Google Pay will give a tough competition to whatsapp
 kyonki google pe bhi apni sarvice lagaataar badha rahaa he or amejon ne bhi UPI besj Amazon Pay pesh kar diya he

 india today kaa sex surveykshan pichley 17 saal se bharatiyon ke yon vyavhaaron ko samajhane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 It seems that in the present times, we have become more open than ever before by crossing our moral taboo about our sex feelings
 desh ke kai bhaag ab sex ko lekar teji se aage nikal gaye hai, kyonki pehali baar sex kaa anubhav lene kii ausat umr ghat gai he
 For example, 61 percent of the people in Guwahati said that they had first experienced sex in adolescence
 yah desh ke un sabhi shaharon main sabase aage rahaa, jahaan surveykshan hue
 Today, 33 percent of people claim they had their first sexual experience in adolescence
 yah baat 2003 se, jab hamaara pehla sex surveykshan hua tha, kaaphi aage nikal chuki he jab keval 8 pratishat logon ne kaha tha ki unka pehla sex anubhav 18 varsh kii umr se pehle hua tha
 The greater web connectivity, wider acceptance of sex and the convenience of morning after pill (contraceptive pill) have probably paved the way for sex at an early age
 is saal, badalte yon vyavhaar or nazariye kaa akalan karne vaale niyamit sawaalon ke alaava, hamane kai nae prashn logon se puche
 We asked them about their fantasy, loyalty, and extramarital sex, thinking about pornography, and the use of drugs such as Viagra to enhance sex capacity, and how they viewed it
 surveykshan main teen-chauthai se adhik logon ne kaha ki ve niyamit rup se yaa kabhi-kabhaar porn dekhte hai—85 pratishat purushon ne is bare main hami bhari
 48 percent of men also admitted that they had had sex by paying money, while 3 percent of women also admitted to doing so
 iske baavjood, surveykshan main adhikansh log—89 pratishat—yon kriya ke dauraan khud ko filmaane yaa tasviren lene ke khilaaf the; 74
 4 percent people were against the idea of the trio
 matlab yah bhi he ki ye log apni fantasiyon yaa tarah-tarah ke prayog ko lekar kuch sashankit the yaa phir apni sabase gupt fantasy ko surveykshankartaaon se saajha karne ko taiyaar nahin the
 Similarly, 64
 4 pratishat log apane partner ke saath kisi strip club yaa swinger club main jane kii baat par nahin khule, or 57 pratishat log prayog ke naam par kisi bhi prakaar kii esandem act (yon kriya ke dauraan mardaangi yaa maar-peet tathaa galigalouj kaa sukh) ke maamle main nahin khule
 But when people in the 14–29 age group were asked about role play, trio, beating during sex or biting their partner, or using dildos, vibrators, etc
, they were certainly more lenient and the percentage difference was negligible
 agast 2018 main, supreme court ne ek aitihaasik faisla sunaaya ki algebiti samudaay ko apni sex bhaavana kaa khulkar izhaar karne kaa adhikaar he
 According to the Solene palette of the first global extramarital dating website Gleiden, which has around 200,000 female members in India, "the website has seen a rise of over 45 percent in homosexual sex during the past six months, implying that I

 ''haalanki, india today sex surveykshan se pataa chalata he ki adhikansh bhartiya abhi bhi apni sex bhaavana ke izhaar se sankoch karte hai or usee surakshit sanskaran ko pasand karte hai jo unhen asahaj nahin karata he
 When asked about sexual trends, 9 out of 10 people said they only had sex with persons of the opposite sex
 patna ekmaatr shahar he (surveykshan main shaamil 19 log) jahaan 58 pratishat logon ne kaha ki ve street sex yani samalangik or vipareet ling sex karte the
 In September 2018, a month after its landmark verdict on homosexuality, the top court rejected another colonial era law related to adultery and ruled that extramarital sex would no longer be considered criminal in India
 phir bhi, jaisaa ki pallate kaa kahana he, ''vivahetar yon sambandhon ko aparaadh kii shrenee se hataae jane ke baavjood, bharat main ab bhi kisi aurat kii bevafaayee bahut bada saamaajik kalank he
 This is the reason why despite the confidential and readily available option of infidelity, women hesitate and this is why the number of men on dating sites is much higher than women
 zyaadaatar bhartiya mahilaayein maanati hai ki bevafaayee ek bahut kharaab or dandaneey krity he
 However, over the last decade, especially in urban India, Indian women have stood on their feet, attained financial freedom, progressed professionally, fought patriarchy and malevolence, a wave of feminism that has led to sex Laker carries a liberal view

 Crimes against women have increased in the last decade

 As a result, we finally saw for the first time a national register of sex offenders issued by the government, an attempt to stop crimes against women
 soshal media ap web ko gandi or anchaahi jagah bhi bana rahe hai jahaan bal yon shoshankartaaon kii aasaan pahunch he, or sibar-blakemeling, sex se judi ugaahi or pratishodhatmak nagnata bad rahi he
 Although the Indian government is blocking major porn sites, 'shadow sites' are being built at lightning speed
 internet kaa syah, shaatir paksh ek andhaa kuan bana hua he jo kaaphi had tak belgaum he
 According to cyber security expert Ritesh Bhatia, "social networking sites, dating portals and smartphone apps contribute largely to crimes like sextortion and cyber stocking
" smartphone aplication or takanic-aadhaarit chizon ke khatarnaak prabhaavon ke bare main logon main jaagrukta kii kami un sabase pramukh kaarnon main se ek he jiske kaaran log sibar aparaadhon kaa shikaar banate hai
 "not only does porn addiction increase crime, it is also causing sexual insecurity and bitterness in relationships
 mumbai sthit inner spes counselling kii sansthaapak or mukhya manovaigyanik sadiya saleed kahati hai, ''aaj porn kii lat yakeenan fail chuki he
 Watching porn too much can distort the reality

 People want instant gratification and porn gives them that

 This is a big indicator of how fast things have changed compared to 18-20 years ago
 22 or 45 varsh umr ke bich ke yuva aaj madad maangane se nahin darate
 However, as much as things have changed in the Indian sexual scene, they remain the same
 hamaare surveykshan ke nattejey bataate hai ki vistrut yon vyavhaar main, purush ateet main fanse rahete hai
 'is virginity important to you? ', In response 53 percent of people (both men and women) said' yes'
 ahmedabad or jaipur jaise chote shaharon main yah sankhya zyada badi kramash: 82 pratishat or 81 pratishat thi
 In 2004, in response to the same question, 72 percent of men said they would like virgin brides for themselves

 On one hand, there is a lot of debate about the Aadhaar card in India
 vahiin duusari taraf china ek aise system par kaam kar rahaa he jo shaayad duniya kaa sabase bada pahchaan kaa database he
 Which will cover the entire population of China i
e
 140 crore people
 is system ko ek tarah kaa soshal credit system kaha ja rahaa he, jo ki 2020 tak puraa ho jayega
 Under this, all citizens will be given a rating based on their economic behavior
 jisamen kuch revords hai to vahiin kuch sajaa bhi hai
 Right now it is only rating on the basis of economic behavior, but soon other factors related to behavior can be added on social media
 china main yah system 2014 se kaam kar rahaa he, lekin 2020 tak iske tahat puri jansankhya cover ho jaaegi
 At the same time, those with poor ratings are also being blacklisted
 abhi tak kya hua asar
 
 
 If we consider the figures so far, about 9 million (90 lakh) people have got poor rating
 inhen ye kharaab reating unke court cese yaa difolt ke aadhaar par mili he
 Air tickets have been banned from those with poor ratings
 - iske alaava kareeb 3 million (30 lakh) logon ko kharaab credit parformens ke aadhaar par hi train kii tikat lene se bhi bain kar diya gaya
 However, this is just the beginning of a kind
 china main jis tarahaonline pementmen teji aa rahi he or ve-chat, alibaba kaa vistaar ho rahaa he
 That is why data of millions of people are available online and credit records are easily tracked
 china kaa aglaa lakshya sabhi nagarikon ko reating system ke tahat laana he
 There are many opinions about this system in China
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki is system se logon ko phayda hoga or bank lone, house lone lene main bhi kaaphi madad karegaa
 So at the same time many local people have opposed that the government is also keeping an eye on the expenditure of the common man
 iske alaava kai aise maamle bhi hai jo chaunkaane vaale hai
 Some schools in the Chinese city of Shandong did not admit children on the same basis, as their parents have poor credit ratings
 iske alaava is system ko itnaa apgrade kiya ja rahaa he ki agar aap koi trephic niyam ko todate hai, to aapaki credit reating par fark padegaa
