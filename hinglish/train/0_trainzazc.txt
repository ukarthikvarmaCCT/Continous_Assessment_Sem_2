 On the other hand, the schools en route to Uttarakhand were also closed

 It was Saheb's rally, not a servant, Surjewala said that Chandigarh was taken hostage for the rally
 piem ke daure kii vajah se shahar main viipi ke naam par naslwad hua
 This was the rally of the officer, not the servant
 isadore se pehle bhi vivadahua tha
 PM apologizes to Brig Devendra Singh, PM Surjewala demanded that PM apologize to Brig Devendra Singh
 darasal, brigadier ke bete kaa antim sanskaar kiya janaa tha
 But the crematorium ghat was also closed due to the pm's rally

 The PM has also come in the past, but not so Surjewala said that even before, the PM and the President have been coming to the city
 lekin is tarah kii viipi naslwad kabhi nahin dekha
 This was a political rally of the BJP and it was paid by Chandigarh

 After the termination of membership of 20 Aam Aadmi Party mlas, former Delhi government minister Kapil Mishra has accused Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of cheating the mlas
 kapil mishra ne somvaar ko ek blog likhaa jisamen unhone aarope lagaate hue kaha ki zyaadaatar vidhayakon ko is baat kaa andaaza hi nahin tha ki unki sadsyta sach main chali jaaegi
 Kapil Mishra, through 10 points in his blog, accused the common man party
 kapil mishra ne kaha ki jab ye pad in 20 vidhayakon ko die gaye tab kanoonee visheshgyon kii raay yahi thi ki ye asanvaidhanik hai, agar chunaav ayog main shikaayat hui to sadsyta radd ho jaaegi lekin iske baavjood ye pad die gaye
 Kapil Mishra said that all the legislators were constantly lied in relation to the case
 vakeelon kii ek team banaai gai, jisane har vidhayak kaa paksh chunaav ayog main rakhaa lekin is team ne vidhayakon ko cese kii pragati ke bare main jaankaree kabhi nahin di
 The allegation of the Aam Aadmi Party was also misunderstood by Kapil Mishra in which it is being said that the Election Commission did not give the mlas a chance to present their case
 kapil mishra ne aarope lagaaya ki is maamle main 11 baar alag se notice die gaye lekin vidhayakon ko yahaan kaha gaya ki ye chunaav ayog kaa adhikaar hi nahin he
 Mishra alleged that the day the Election Commission sent its opinion to the President, the mlas also lied that a stay would be granted in the High Court
 lekin jab hoicourt main fatkaar lagi to vidhayakon ko bolaa gaya ki abhi supreme court main sunwaayee main samay lag jayega
 Kapil Mishra wrote in the blog that the mlas have understood Kejriwal's lies but are now trapped
 zyaadaatar vidhayakon ko lag rahaa he ki gussa karne yaa sawaal uthaane par tikat bhi cat jaaegi or karier khatm ho jayega
 The AAP will knock the door of the court
 AAP has made up its mind to go to the party court
 aap ke 20 vidhayak somvaar ko hoicourt kaa rukh karenge or raashtrapati ke aadesh ko dilli hoicourt me chunauti denge
 The party has been undergoing review for the past few days on the performance of the Congress in four states
 chunaav parinaamon main congress ke santoshjanak pradarshan nahin hone kii samiksha ke liye congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne ek cameti banaai he
 The committee consists of AK Antony Sushil Kumar Shinde and Sheila Dixit

 The committee will review the party's performance in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa

 At least Rahul Gandhi's attitude is pointing this way

 According to the mlas, Rahul Gandhi said that now only the leaders with mass support will be taken forward
 party ke hit main bade−bade balidaan honge
 In the meeting, the mlas criticized the statements of the big leaders

 The Union Minister said that romance begins in films with tampering

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kaa bahuprachaarit sho tok tu eke ab sibiai jaanch ke ghere main he
 Delhi government has been accused that through this event, Kejriwal and his government campaigned in the states where elections are going to be held and Aam Aadmi Party is contesting elections
 aarope ye bhi he ki dilli sarkaar ne taak tu eke event ke jariye chunavi rajyon main apni raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon ko puraa kiya or chunavi hit saadhane ke liye dilli kii janata ke tex ke paise ko apane prachaar par lutaaney kii yojana banaai
 Talk to AK is the much publicized event of the Delhi government in which Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal directly communicated to the public through social media and online media
 daawa ye tha ki is tok tu eke program secogeriwal or dilli sarkaar kaa maksadadilli kii janata ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dena or unki samasyaon ko sidhe sunakar suljhaana he
 But now what has been revealed, questions are being raised on the intention of Kejriwal government
 puure event par aarope lage ki dilli sarkaar ne dedh karod se zyada kharch karne kaa plan banaaya
 It is also shocking that the purpose of this whole event was to communicate with the people of Delhi but the whole focus was on Punjab, Goa, Gujarat and Himalch Pradesh
 in rajyon ke votaron ke bich pahunchnaa or kejariwal ke is event ko inrajyon main popular banane ke makasadase ye aayojan kiya gaya
 Significantly, all these states are going to have elections within the next one year
 bijepi netaa harish khurana ne kaha ki is khulaase ke baad koi shaq nahin he ki dilli kii janata se baat karne kii aad main kaise dilli ke paise ko barbaad kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that we have been saying this already but now it has become clear
 kejariwal sarkaar jawaab de ki kyon wo sarkari paise ko apane prachaar ke liye lutaa rahe hai
 Why Punjab, Goa, Gujarat are being promoted with Delhi money
 piaar form ko kis aadhaar par aapane work order jari kiye
 This is a big scam which is a sign of corruption of this government
 soshal media par kejariwal ke popular hone kii vajah he ki fasebuk par like kharide ja rahe hai
 Three to five rupees of money is being given one by one, this falsehood has also arisen
 ajtak ke paas is puure aayojan kaa masauda maujuud he jise dilli sarkaar ke prachaar nideshaalay ne taiyaar kiya tha
 It was also carried out through PR agency Perfect Relations
 sarkari dastavenjon ke mutabik jo khulaasa hua he wo chaunkaane vaala he, kyoki isamen saaf-saaf likhaa he ki tok tu eke event kaa focus dilli ke alaava goa, gujarat or punjab main rakhaa jaae
 Talk to AK should be populated among people above 18 years of age in these states
 aapako bataa den ye vahi rajya hai jahaan aane vaale maheenon main chunaav hone hai or aam aadmi party puri taiyaari ke saath in chunaavon main utar rahi he
 According to the Directorate of Information and Publicity's note, there was talk of running a two-part campaign for the Talk to an event on July 17
 pehla campan, event ke pehle 8 se 17 july 2016 tak hona tha or doosraa tok tu eke ke baad yani 17 se 23 july tak tay tha
 Through this campaign, social platforms like Facebook, Google, youtube have been targeted to reach millions of people
 fasebuk campan ko dilli ke alaava punjab, goa or gujarat main laanch karne kii baat likhi gai he jabaki post event campan ko google, utyub or fasebuk ke jariye deshbhar main prachaarit karne kii baat darj he
 According to the Delhi government's note, PR agency Perfect Relations was asked by the Deputy CM to immediately start a campaign to make the Talk to AK event popular in digital media
 saath hi piaar agency ne is purexmpan ke kharch kii laagatek karod 58 lakh 75 hajaar rupye tay kii thi
 However, this cost was later reduced to one crore five lakh rupees
 campan kii yojana se pataa chalata he ki event kaa makasad sirf dilli kii janata se samvaad karne tak simit nahin tha, balki nishaanaa wo rajya the, jahaan aam aadmi party kii raajnneetik mahatvakankshaayen kulachen bhar rahi he
 According to this plan, the target audience in the campaign run before the Talk to AK event were people of Delhi Gujarat, Goa, Punjab and Himachal for over eighteen years
 yani aise log jo vayask hon or vot de sakate hon
 Through CPC on Boost Post, Website Promotion and Display Aid, a target has been set to reach about two lakh people
 fasebuk ke har like ke liye teen se chah rupye kii keemat rakhi gai or das dinon ke liye chah lakh rupye rose kaa kharch tay kiya gaya
 It aims to reach two million people
 you tub par vigyaapan ke liye taak tu eke event ke pehle 25 lakh rupye kaa kharch tay kiya gaya
 It was intended to reach 2 million people
 utyub par har vyuu ke liye assi paise kharch kiye jane kaa prastaav diya gaya tha
 For this, Pan India target was kept
 google disple network par vigyaapan se chalis lakh logon tak pahunchane kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya or teen din main bees lakh rupye ke kharch kaa prastaav tha
 Two clicks were spent on Google for every click
 tok tu eke event hone ke baad 18 se 23 july ke bich bhi campan jor-shor se chalaane kii yojana banaai gai
 In addition to Delhi, it aims to connect people of Punjab, Goa, Gujarat and Himachal over 18 years
 faisbook par bees lakh kii laagat se kareeb 60 lakh logon tak pahunchane kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya
 The proposal was sent for approval of the Finance Department after the approval of the Deputy Chief Minister, as the rates for the advertisements were not at the DAVP rate but at the commercial rate
 is bich agrim manjuuri ke jariye parfect relation ko campan shuru karne kii ijaajat de di gai thi
 Aam Aadmi Party MLA and former minister Somnath Bharti defended the government, saying that Talk to AK was a dialogue with the public
 isamen paise kii koi barbaadi nahin hui
 He said that the reach of social media is worldwide, then how can it be propagated in a particular state
 fasebuk, you tub kisi bhi rajya ke log dekh sakate hai, deshbhar ke log soshal media kaa istemaal karte hai
 Allegations of campaigning through the event are baseless

 rajd ke netaa magangavar kii shaam ko manthan karne ke baad bhale hi on record yah kah rahe hon ki tejasvi kaa istipha dene kaa sawaal hi nahin he lekin of da record maanate hai ki raajnneetik dwesh ke alaava unke paas koi aisa tathy yaa tark nahin he jisase ve nitish ko santusht kar saken
 The senior RJD leader also believes that the condition that Nitish Kumar has laid down without waiting for the CBI to be questioned or the court verdict or charge sheet, the party is currently unable to accept his demand
 haalanki ve ye bhi maanate hai ki yadi lalu yadav mahagathbandhan ko bachaane ke liye tejasvi yaa sabhi rajd mantriyon kaa istipha kara bhi den lekin bada sawaal yah uthta he ki kya isse nitish kumaar yaa unki party talmail jari rakhegi
 On the other hand, JDU leaders believe that Nitish Kumar has made up his mind that the future of the Grand Alliance is not going to be very long now and that the main basis of Nitish's faith is that he is being told by CBI officials about the CBI allegations
 It is more known that all the facts of the mess which continued till the last 12 years, from the Ministry of Railways to the construction of malls Information you have, the basis of which at least this case Lalu and raise their families misunderstanding of innocent believers
 tippaniyan Anyway, Nitish Kumar's stand on corruption is very clear
 ateet main paanch mantriyon ko in aaropon ke chalate istipha dena padaa he or nitish kumaar kii saarvajanik jivan main chhavi hi unki sabase badi puunji he
 During the JDU meeting on Tuesday, RCP Singh and Minister Lalan Singh, close mps of Nitish, also said in clear terms that our party does not have the support of the broad castes but because of your clean image, support of every caste and community And if it is not left, then we will become irrelevant in politics? udhar congress netaaon kaa maananaa he ki nitish kumaar ne saarvajanik rup se tejasvi yadav ko ultimatum dekar ek tareeke se mahagathbandhan ko tilanjali dene kii bhoomika taiyaar kar di he or unka maananaa he ki nitish kumaar ab kab is mahagathbandhan ko by-by kahenge, uskaa samay nitish hi tay karenge
 The Congress has a complaint with Nitishka, but believes that if Lalu and Nitish sit together and negotiate, a solution can be found
 haalanki congressi netaa maanate hai ki yadi nitish ne man bana liya he to mahagathbandhan ke bhavishya par sawalia nishaal khadaa ho jaataa he or nitish ke bhavishya main bijepi ke saath jane kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa

 On the other hand, Congress leaders believe that Nitish Kumar has prepared the role of publicly giving a ultimatum to Tejashwi Yadav in a way to give the Grand Alliance a break and he believes that when Nitish Kumar will now call this Grand Alliance by-bye, its time Nitish will decide
 congress ko vaise to neetish se koi shikaayat he lekin uskaa maananaa he ki yadi lalu or nitish mil-baithkar baatcheet karen to samasya kaa samaadhaan nikal saktaa he
 However, the Congress leader believes that if Nitish has made up his mind, the future of the grand alliance is questioned and Nitish's chances of joining the BJP in future cannot be ruled out

 Both are playing very well
 lopa stand bhi leti hai
 Sometimes they get angry too
 baaki koi khami nahin he
 i have been voting for Lopa from outside
 andar bhale hi wo kamjor dikhe lekin baahar se log use saport kar rahe hai
 Naveen: i think this Barmanveer Gurjarbig can come out as the winner of the boss because he has gained a lot of popularity with the support of the public and can become a winner
 priyanka jagga:mujhe pataa he is saal big bos koun jeetne vaala he
 No one else has made it

 All these words that break the heart and make the mind numb will be threaded in the garland of Hughmatam, no one knew
 mumbai se lekar melbern tak or dilli se lekar edilade takahar koi dukhi he
 Everyone is crying sach to yah he ki is ek haadase neaustralian khilaadiyon kii pahchaan hi badal kar rakh dihe
 What Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke? jo jo cricketer maidan main chillane ke liye badnaam the, beyimaani ke liye badnaam the, jinke liye kai baar maidan ke kaayade kanoon or samvednaaon ke koi myne hi nahin the, wo andar tak hill gaye hai
 Australian cricketers who have always worked with the mind are now seen descending to the depths of the heart
 sach main is ek haadase ne australian cricket kii tasviir ko hi badal kar rakh diya he
 The cricket world is witnessing a broken, helpless and vulnerable Australia in place of an aggressive Australia
 25 november ko sidney cricket ground main cricket par phil huge ke khun ke taur par jo laal daag laga, wo to kabhi nahin mitega lekin is haadase ne twitor se lekar fasebuk tak or manch se lekar maidan tak puri cricket birdari ko ek saath laakar khadaa kar diya
 Then whether he is a fan or an existing cricketer or a veteran
 master blaster sachin tendulkar ne hayuj ko shradhanjali dene ke liye apana 15 saal purana balla tak nikaal liya to team india ke captain viraat kohli ne edilade main phil huge ko yaad kiya or apane balle par cap rakh kar huge ko salaami di
 It is said that time heals every wound, but no one knows how much time it will take to heal this wound
 haalanki cricket australia ne khilaadion kii manodasha ko dekhte hue duusare practice match ko radd kar diya or phir pehla test bhi sthagit kar diya gaya
 Arguments were made, arguments were made
 kisi ne kaha ki test ko radd hi kar do to kisi ne kaha ki huge kii maut se ham dukhi to hai lekin isamen phens kaa kya kasoor
 Let the cricket world cry
 mana ki australia ne 25 saal kaa honhaar cricketer kho diya he
 Admittedly, the players of Australia do not have the mood to get on the ground but there is only one way to leave this pain, this sorrow and this mourning behind and that is cricket
 kyonki cricket hi takat degaa
 Cricket alone will give you the courage to stand up
 jisane chhina he, ab vahi usase ubarne kii shakti degaa
 The same cricket that gave strength to Sachin Tendulkar that he should overcome his father's death and leave for the World Cup the very next day
 vahi cricket jisane viraat kohli ko takat di thi ki pita kii maut se ubarkar agle din wo maidan par utre or apni team dilli ke liye badi pari khelen
 It is true that life does not stop
 isiilie cricket australia ne test siries ke shedul ko badal diya taaki khilaadi maidan par utarane kii himmat juta paaen
 Brisbane will now have the first Test in Adelaide which starts on 9 December
 gavaskar border trophy ke liye kheli jane vaali siries main ection ke din aane vaale hai lekin cricket ke maidan par ab huge ke liye kabhi ection nahin hoga

 However, with the custody of two people in the case, the police have claimed that the employees of a property website that flew the drone were taking an aerial view of their property
 lekin badi baat ye he ki drone takreeban 25 minute tak hawa main tha or 50 se 60 foot kii oonchai par lekin mumbai police ko bhanak tak nahin lagi

 But the big thing is that the drone was in the air for about 25 minutes and at an altitude of 50 to 60 feet, but the Mumbai police did not even notice it
 wo to tata instyit of soshal sains ke professor kii drone par najar pad gai or unhone police ko suchit kar diya
 According to the professor, on Monday afternoon, he saw a drone flying near the institute
 thodi der baad drone udaane vaale ek car main baith kar chale gayi
 The place where the drone was flying was near the Bhabha Atomic Research Center, so the professor took a precautionary shot of the drone with his mobile
 or car kaa bhi number note kar police ko suchit kar diya
 The police got into action as soon as the information was received because the city is prohibited from flying drones without the permission of the police
 car ke number ke aadhaar par police ne donon ko hiraasat main le liya or us drone ko bhi jabt kar liya
 According to DCP Sangram Singh Nishadar, the picture taken from the drone is being studied

 The kidnapped doctor and his compound from Delhi have been recovered by the police with the help of UP STF
 badmaashon ne donon ko agava karke unke parivaar se 25 karod kii phiroti maangi thi
 In this regard, the police has arrested seven miscreants from Etah district of UP
 jabaki mukhya aaropee abhi bhi faraar he
 Dr Vinod Kumar Verma and his compound Ajay were abducted by a gang of miscreants from Delhi late on 13 September
 is apharan kii sajeesh do maah pehle hi rachi gai thi
 Delhi Police and UP STF freed the doctor and compounder in a joint operation
 police ke mutabik 13 sitambar ko bike savaar kuch badmaashon ne doctor kii car main do baar takkar maari
 When the doctor stopped and asked the accused for the reason, he had tied them both on the strength of arms
 doctor shor na machaae iske liye badmaashon ne un donon ko behoshee kaa injection laga diya tha
 When Dr
 Vinod, who runs a clinic in Jaitpur area of delhi, did not return home till late night, the family lodged a police complaint
 isi bich 14 sitambar ko badmaashon ne doctor ke ghar waalon ko phone karke 25 karod rupee kii phiroti maangi
 But later the deal between the miscreants and the family for the release of both was decided for Rs 39 lakh

 The by-election to be held on March 11 in one Lok Sabha and 2 assembly seats of Bihar is extremely important for both Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav
 ek taraf jahaan bhaajapa ke saath phir se gathbandhan kar sarkaar banane ke baad nitish kii pehali chunavi pariksha he
 At the same time, it is also a big test for Tejashwi after RJD supremo and his father Lalu Prasad Yadav went to jail in the fodder scam
 arriya loksabhaa samet jahanabad or bhabhua vidhansabha seat par hone vaale chunaav ke nattejey bhavishya main pradesh kii raajnneeti kii dasha or disha tay karenge
 BJP has fielded candidates for Araria Lok Sabha seat and Bhabhua Assembly seat and JDU on Jehanabad
 bataa den ki nitish kumaar ke liye jahanabad upachunaav behad mahatvapurn he kyonki nitish kumaar ne pehle elaan kar diya tha ki unki party jadyu upachunaav main hissaa nahin legi, lekin bhaajapa ke aagrah ke baad jadyu ne jahanabad seat par ummidavaar khadaa kiya
 At the same time, in the by-election, RJD had already announced to contest the elections in all the three seats
 lekin congress ne jab bhabhua se chunaav ladane kii ichha jataai to lalu prasad yadav ne bhabhua seat congress ke liye chhod di
 In this by-election, RJD, Congress, JDU and BJP have made the contest very interesting with the four parties fielding candidates
 vahiin, lalu ke jail jane ke baad ab party kii kaman tejasvi yadav ke haath main he or jimmedaari sanbhaalane ke baad tejasvi yadav ke liye bhi yah pehali chunavi pariksha he
 The Araria Lok Sabha and Jehanabad assembly seats were with the RJD till now and winning both these seats has become a question of prestige for Tejashwi
 gauratlab he ki isaupachunaavamein agar bhaajapa jadyu gathbandhan teenon siton par chunaav jeet jaati he to kahin naa kahin yah nitish kumaar kaa mahagathbandhan ko chhodkar bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar banane ke faisle par muhar hogi
 On the other hand, if RJD wins elections in all three seats, then it will be a sign of the rise of a stunning era in Bihar politics

 The Election Commission has excluded 255 political parties from its registration list, whose existence is only on paper
 chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki aise hi ek raajnneetik dal kaa jo pataa bataaya gaya he, vah kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh kaa awaas he
 Not only this, the registration of a political party was also done at the office address of Jammu and Kashmir CID in Delhi
 chunaav ayog ne samiksha ke baad paaya tha ki in raajnneetik dalon kii taraf se 2005 se 2015 ke bich koi bhi candidet vidhaan sabha yaa lok sabha kaa chunaav nahin ladaa he
 According to the news of the Indian Express, one of them is a political party which has been given the address of 17 Akbar Road, New Delhi, which is the official residence of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh
 is raajnneetik dal kaa naam he- 'aal india progressive janata dal'
 Similarly, the address given by the 'holy Hindustan Kadgam' party at 11, Harish Chandra Mathur Lane, Delhi, has the office of Jammu and Kashmir CID
 gudgaanv ke pate se registerd aise hi ek raajnneetik dal 'rashtriya mathrubhumi party' ke kartadharta teen manjila bangale main rahane vaale ek homeopathy doctor hai
 He claims that due to lack of funds, he has absorbed the functioning of this party only five-six years ago
 is suchi ko chunaav ayog ne kendriya pratyaksh kar board (CBDT) ke paas bhej diya he, taaki vah vittiya maamalon kii jaanch ke liye 'aage kii karrwai' kar sake
 These parties can no longer be granted exemption to registered political parties

 Bharatiya Janata Party national president Amit Shah has also jumped into politics started in Madhya Pradesh regarding Vande Mataram
 shah ne congress par hindustan ke dil madhyapradesh ko tushtikaran kaa centre banane kaa aarope lagaaya
 On the social media platform Facebook, he wrote that this decision of the Kamal Nath government to ban the national song is extremely unfortunate and shameful
 amit shah ne likhaa, ''vande maataram maatr ek geet bhar nahin hokar yah bharat kii swatantraaa aandolan kaa pratik or prayek bhartiya kaa preranabindu he
 Vande Mataram contains the emotional expression of the whole of India
 vande maataram par pratibandh lagaakar congress ne na sirf desh kii swadhinata ke liye vande maataram kaa jai ghosh gaakar apana sarvasv arpan karne vaale vir balidaniyon kaa apmaan kiya he, balki yah madhya pradesh kii janata ke saath bhi vishwasghaat he
 Insulting the sacrifices of the country in any kind of political thinking is like treason in the eyes of a common Indian like me
 ''unhone likhaa, ''vande maataram kisi ek varg vishesh kaa nahin he balki bharat kii swatantraaa ke liye apane praan aahut karne vaale lakhon senaniyon ke tyaag kaa pratik hai or keval ek varg vishesh ko khush karne ke liye iskaa apmaan karnaa bahut hi dukh:da, sharmnaak evam desh kii swatantraaa kaa apmaan bhi he
 Asking Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Amit Shah wrote, is it his decision to insult Vande Mataram? On this unfortunate decision of the Congress government, Rahul Gandhi should make his stand clear to the people of the country
 bataa den, madhyapradesh kii kamalnath sarkaar ne 13 saal kii puraani parampara ko khatm karte hue sachivalay main maheene ke pehle din vande maataram nahin gaaya tha
 In fact, every week before the cabinet meeting, all the ministers and all the employees and officers in the secretariat sing Vande Mataram on the first date of every month
 is baar saal 2019 ke pehle kaamkaaji din par raashtragit nahin gaaya gaya
 On this, former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that if the Congress is ashamed to sing the national anthem, then he himself will sing Vande Mataram in the Secretariat
 iskaa jawaab dete hue kamalnath ne kaha ki jo vande maataram nahin gaate hai kya wo deshbhakt nahin hai? BJP President Nitin Gadkari has regretted his statement on the IQ of Vivekananda and Dawood Ibrahim

 yachika main rijwaana ne uske pati ko udaipurgelmen hi rakhe jane kii apil kii
 On Monday, the Rajasthan High Court heard the matter
 mohammad ajam khan kii patni rijwaana ne court se kaha ki uske patisoharabuddin encountermaamle main mukhya gavaah hai
 His life is in danger
 lihaaja unhen kisi or jail main shift naa kiya jaae balki udaipur jail main hi rakhaa jaae
 Rizwana does not trust the Udaipur police
 rijwaana ne bataaya ki use bhi dhamkee di ja rahi he
 After Rizwana's appeal, government lawyer Vikram Singh informed the High Court that Mohammad Azam Khan was to be shifted to Ajmer Central Jail, but this action has been stopped at the moment
 abhi use udaipur central jail main hi rakhaa jayega
 However, the government lawyer said that Azam Khan's life in Udaipur jail is in danger as there is no arrangement to keep him alone there
 jail main kaidiyon kii taadaad bhi zyada he
 Not only this, the notorious crook Imran and his gang are in Udaipur jail
 aise main ajam khan ke liye khatra bana hua he
 While hearing the matter, Justice PS Bhati gave the order to hold the next hearing after 6 weeks
 navaratraur dashahara ke paavan parv main varanasi kendriya kaara main in dinon kaidi bhi ramlila kaa manchan kar rahe hai
 Around 35 prisoners are lodged in the central jail

 He said that the prisoners have formed their own committee to stage Ramlila
 ramlila main adaakaari karne vaale kaidi kareeb ek maheenaa pehle se apane-apane kirdaar kii reharsal kar rahe hai
 Ramlila started in jail last year
 iskaa kharch rotary club ne vahan kiya tha, lekin is saal jail prashasan hi kharch vahan kar rahaa he
 Prakash said, 'the Rotary Club did not show interest in organizing Ramlila in jail this year
 lekin ham kaidiyon ke bich ramlila ke manchan kaa silsilaa band nahin karnaa chaahate the
 So all the jail officials decided to organize Ramlila by collecting donations among themselves
 'ramlila dopaher ko shuru hoti he or suraj dhalane ke saath samaapt ho jaati he
 Everyday, different episodes of the Ramayana are staged, on good dialogue, the audience cheers the prisoners by cheering applause
 varanasi kendriya kaara main kul 1920 kaidi hai
 Prakash said that Ramlila is staged in the day itself, because lighting will have to be arranged at night
 baahar ke logon ko ramlila dekhne kii anumit nahin hoti he, kyonki isse suraksha sambandhh dikkatein aa sakati hai
 This unique Ramlila performed by prisoners will end with burning effigy of Ravana on Dashami
 dashami ke din jail ke andar hi ram or lakshmana dwaara ravan, meghnad or kumbhkarna ke putale jalaae jaaenge
 These 25-foot mannequins are also made by the prison inmates
 prakaash ne bataaya ki jail main ramlila manchan kaa uddeshy kaidiyon ko yah sandesh dena he ki buraai par hameshaa achchhai kii jeet hoti he
 He said, 'we get to learn decent behavior from Ramayana
 ramlila ke jariye kaidiyon ke man main achche bhav utpann honge or bhagwaan ram ke jivan se sikh lekar ve unhen apni aage kii jindagi main aatmsaat karenge
 'ramleela is playing the character of Lord Ram, Jayaprakash

 AAP leader Manish Sisodia told after the meeting that his party has not got a clear mandate so it has been decided to sit in the opposition
 ab agar chunavi nattejey ke aankadon par najar daalen to 70 siton vaali dilli vidhansabha main sabase badi party ke taur par bijepi ko 31 siten mili hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party won 28 seats in a miraculous reshuffle, while the Congress unit was reduced to 8
 teen anya siton main 1 jediu, 1 shiromani akali dal or 1 nirdaleey ummidavaar ke paas he
 This time the voting percentage in Delhi set a record
 jaahir he janata ne vot sarkaar banane ke liye die, lekin jo nateeja aayaa vah uljhan main daalane vaala he
 To form a government, any party must have more than half that is 36 seats
 lekin raajnneetik ganit feet nahin baith rahaa, kyonki bijepi or shiramani akali dal kii siton ko jod den to endie elliance kaa aankada 32 par aakar thahar jaataa he jo jaruri aankade se chaar kam he
 The Aam Aadmi Party of the majority has already clarified that it will not go to any party for the alliance
 party kaa kahana he ki aisa karnaa janata ko dhokhaa dena hoga
 AAP says he is ready to sit in the opposition
 vahiin, bijepi kaa kahana he ki bahumat ke abhaav main vah sarkaar nahin banaaegi
 BJP CM candidate Dr
 harshavardhan pehle hi bahumat nahin milane ke kaaran niraashaa jaahir kar chuke hai
 Due to no party getting majority, the matter has got complicated in Delhi
 aise main samay kii sui, jo kuch vikalp suza rahi he, uske tahat ab sabhi kii nigahen rajbhavan par tik gai hai
 Now a lot depends on the decision of Lt
 Governor Najeeb Jung
 samvidhan visheshgy in paristhitiyon main raashtrapati shashan kii sambhaavna se bhi inkaar nahin kar rahe hai
 At the same time, even after waiting for some time, if the hope of government formation is not made, then elections can also be held
 jod-tod kii raajnneetiparampara ke anusaar sabase badi party ke taur par uparajyapal bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa de sakate hai, lekin party ke liye bahumat jutaney ke raste main kai mushkilen hai
 She can bring an independent MLA into her court, but Shoaib Iqbal, who won on the Janata Dal United ticket, rarely accompanies her
 isi tarah congress ko tode bagaiyr bijepi ke liye teen vidhayakon kaa jugad nahin ho saktaa
 At the same time, another option would be to break the Aam Aadmi Party, which seems difficult
 rajya sarkaar kii ore se paarit gujarat nijee skool fees niyaman adhinium 2017 ke baad bhi skulon kii ore se manamaani fees vasuulne ke khilaaf gujarat sarkaar kade kadam uthaane vaali he
 On Thursday, Education Minister Bhupendra Singh Chudasama said that the school's arbitrariness will no longer work
 fees ko lekar chaatro kaa bhavishya kharaab nahin hona chahie
 Education Minister Bhupendra Singh Chudasama said, 'under the guide line of the Supreme Court, we will now take tough measures against the arbitrariness of the school
 rajya sarkaar kii ore se fees ko lekar nai kamity bhi banaayi gayi he
 The school administration will have to follow the new guide line of the government
 kanoon sarkaar kii ore se banaaya gaya he use 2017-2018 se lagu kiya gaya he
 According to the Supreme Court Guided Line, schools that have charged high fees will also have to be returned to the parents
 darasal, is kanoon ke tahat primary shiksha main sabhi skulon ke liye ek hi fees 15,000 tay kii gai he
 At the same time, fees have been fixed at 22,000 for secondary and 25,000 for higher secondary
 dilachasp baat ye he ki, is baar sarkari kanoon ke chalate kai abhibhavakon ne kanoon ke mutabik fees di he
 But many schools did not give hall tickets to the students in the final examination
 jis parasarkaarne apana rukh saaf karte hue kaha he ki, skool ko sarkaar ke niyam ko maananaa hi padegaa
 They cannot tamper with the students' future

 (input bhashaa se) Sarai Kale Khan area of the capital Delhi shook with the sound of gunfire in the morning when about half a dozen rounds of firing took place between the police and the crook, in which a crook named Saddam was injured
 saddaam par lut, phiroti or hatya kii koshish jaise aadha darjan se zyada maamle darj hai

 Allegations of sexual assault against leading English cricket writer Peter Roebuck are still to be investigated
 unhone 12 november ko capatoun main apane hotel kii chhathi manzil se kudakar jaan de di thi
 The hotel is a few steps from the ground where his last test match was being played
 police kii vardidhari or sade vesh kii divijanon ke sadasyon ne hotel kii lobby main jaahiri taur par roebuck kii maut se chand minute pehle unase mulaakaat kii thi
 a conversation with the police seems to have inspired him to end his life
 police ne is bare main tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya he ki kya vah roebuck ke khilaaf yon utpeedan ke aarope kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Police spokesperson Colonel Vishnu Naidu told India Today, "we can neither confirm nor deny this
 ''naidu ne yah puche jane par ki jab police sawaal kaa saaf jawaab dekar roebuck kii maut se jude kuch rahasy dur kar sakati he to vah is tarah kaa pintara kyon apana rahi he, kaha, ''mere paas apni vajahen hai
 His answer to this was clear that if the main suspect dies, will the criminal investigation continue even then
 ''jaruri nahin ki ham un halaat main maamle ko band kar denge; basharte koi jaanch pehle se chal rahi ho
 The fact that Roebuck had been convicted of harassing three young cricketers during coaching sessions at his home in England in 2001 gave further speculation to what his secret life would have been like
 unhone 9 november ko ek yuva vyakti se milane ke bare main kaha tha, jo ''hotel main mere kamare main aayaa tha'' or yah ki kis tarah ''zimbabwe ke 40 cricketer meri dekharekh main hai
 Naidu said that Roebuck's corpse was done postmortem, but he immediately added that this investigation, which is done in cases of unnatural death in which there is no suspicion of fraud, has been completed
 It takes months or even years

 Discussion on who will get tickets from which region in Bihar and whose ticket will be 'whom' is hot
 haalanki sabhi partiyaan abhi phoonk-foonkkar kadam badha rahi hai
 Here is the 12th installment of 'bihar Diary before Election', taking stock of the electoral situation
 
 
 1
 BJP MLA Santosh Kushwaha will contest from Purnia on JDU ticket, it is almost certain
 chunaav main yah normal baat he
 The party of good governance has no problem with the saffron pawns, only with the wazir
 nitish babu sirf vidhayak tod paa rahe hai, bijepi unke saansad tod rahi he
 That is, someone is robbing a stone, some diamond
 jahaan tak tikat conform hone kii baat he, to kai baar to party adhyaksh raat ke dhai baje bhi kisi 'bure khwab' kii vajah se tikat badal detaa he
 But this BJP MLA from Biasi (purnia) is so confident that he has twice organized grand banquet and once Satyanarayana Puja cum banquet
 aisa 'apano ko taulne' ke liye kiya gaya he
 Kushwaha has the secret support of Pappu Yadav, including the support of 'lakshmi'
 duusari taraf kushvaha ke maidan main aane se purniya kii ladaai isliye rochak ho jaaegi ki usamen pappu yadav ke kudane kii sambhaavna majboot ho jaaegi
 Pappu wants the fight triangular, so that Uday Singh alias Pappu Singh of BJP can be defeated
 yon kushvaha ne thik hi kiya
 The future was stuck in Purnia's sitting MP in BJP
 ab sushasan ke tikat par chunaav ladane se na keval 'lakshmi' kii baari aamad hogi, balki jila collector bhi saal bhar phone uthayega
 Win and lose is a different thing
 udhar kushvaha kaa naam aate hi bahut dinon se tikat kii aas lagaae vidhayak lacy singh ne munh phula liya he
 Threatened that if Kushwaha was given a ticket, the entire district committee of JDU would resign
 lekin jaanane vaale jaanate hai ki jediu jaisi partiyon main jila-cameti kisi hoti he

 ye ramaadhar singh basepur ke nahin, balki bihar ke aurangabad se vidhayak hai or anna tip dhamkee de rahe hai
 The secret news is that Ramadhar Singh threatened that if JDU MP Sushil Singh was given BJP ticket from Aurangabad, he would eat poison at the party headquarters
 dhamkee kaa asar hua
 There was great infamy, so the BJP got scared, while rajnath-modi had finalized
 gauratlab he ki ye vahi susheel singh hai, jinhone pichhali baar ramaadhar ke khilaaf apane bhai ko argedy se chunaav ladava diya tha or maasoomiyat se kaha tha ki unka bhai unki aukaat se baahar ho gaya he
 At that time there was also an alliance of JDU-BJP
 susheel singh, bhai ko vidhayak banavaane ke liye tatkaal ke laalach main aa gaye the, ab ramaadhar singh kaayade se badla le rahe hai
 Aurangabad is the Rajputana of Bihar and once upon a time Satyendra Narayan Singh alias Chote Sahab was a great leader
 unke pita anugrah narayan singh bade swatantraaa senaanee hue
 Chhote Sahab also became the Chief Minister, his son was Delhi Police Commissioner Nikhil Kumar, he also became an MP and his wife Shyama Singh
 nikhil kumaar kii maa kishori singh bhi vaishali se saansad thim
 In total, Chhote Sahab's family was 9 times MP
 idhar kuch dinon se susheel singh jaage hai, lekin ramaadhar singh ne thaan liya he ki is baar dilli nahin jane denge

 Experts say that in cases where it is difficult for the investigating officers to collect evidence, they can ask an accused to become a government witness and in return, the accused gets a minor punishment or no punishment is given at all
 is bich, magistrate ne aropiyon kii nyaayik hiraasat 19 janvari tak badha di or kaha ki jari kiye gaye peshi ke mutabik ve saat janvari ko sambandhit adaalat ke saamne pesh hon

 apane aadesh main magistrate ne kaha, ‘sabhi aropiyon ko bataaya gaya he ki yadi unke paas koi vakil nahin he to ve is mukademe main sarkari vakil kii madad le sakate hai
 Accused Pawan and Vinay have refused to take the help of the government lawyer and said that they want to testify on behalf of the government
 ’adaalat ne kaha, ‘aaropee ram or mukesh ne kisi vakil kii madad nahin lee he, lihaaja ve sarkari vakil kii madad lenaa chaahate hai
 They should be provided with a public prosecutor
 sabhi chaar aropiyon ko saat janvari ko sambandhit adaalat ke saamne pesh hone kaa aadesh diya jaataa he
 The magistrate said in his order, "the accused Pawan and Vinay have been instructed to file an appropriate application in the court concerned to become a government witness

 Race 3, which has been earning hugely at the box office, has collected crores on the 12th day as well
 haalanki trade analist ise flop bataa rahe hai
 They are also counting all the reasons why this film, which has earned 150 crores in India, has been included in the list of flop films
 aaie jaanate hai isaki vajah
 
 
 10 records in 10 days at box office, is super hit race 3 over? The honeymoon period ended the first day, the biggest re- cord breaking race 3 of the year has made 10 records in 7 days at the box office
 itane record banane ke baavjood res 3 ko salmaan kii badi flop bataaya ja rahaa he
 Talking about the film's earnings, Race 3 has crossed the Rs 158 crore mark by the 11th day of release
 salmaan ke staradam ke chalate hi is film ne jitani kamai kerani thi kar lee, lekin ab isamen dhire-dhire girwat dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Not only this, after two days, the film's earnings may decrease even further
 kyonki 29 june ko saal kii much awated film sanju relies hone ja rahi he
 Seeing the craze of the audience for this film, it seems that the coming time will tarnish the business of Race 3
 or angreji ke frej main kahen to res 3 kaa honeymoon period khatm ho gaya he
 Actually, since the release of Race 3, there has been no such film that can compete with Race 3 at the box office
 'sanju' kii relies se pehle twitor par bhide ranbir-salmaan ke phens, aise udaaya majaakkyon flop maani jaae salmaan kii is film ko?salmaan khan kii ab tak kii sabase badi film "sultan" kii baat karen to is film ne pehle hi weekend main 180 karod kama liye the
 Race 3 could not earn as much as Sultan earned in three days in 12 days
 160 karod ke bade bajet ke baavjood ye film bharat main apane bajet ke aankade ko bhi paar nahin pai he
 The profits are much lower than the big budget
 film kii videshi kamai ko chhod diya jaae to lagata he res 3 ke liye ab 200 karod club main entry karne kii bhi ummid kam hi bachi he
 By the way, this film has collected more than Rs 250 crore in terms of worldwide collection
 salmaan kaa staradam sirf phans tabgar industry main salmaan ke chaahane waalon kii kami nahin he to unke hetars bhi kam nahin
 Critics criticizing Race 3 have spoken to the hearts of viewers who are bored with the Salman franchise films
 ection to thik he lekin ab naa sirf hetars balki salmaan ke phans bhi acchhee kahani kii ummid rakhte hai
 After the lackluster story of Tubelight and Race 3, it would be very difficult for Salman if he did a film with no other headless story
 kehane kaa matlab ye he ki phans kii shifting unke aalochakon ke group main naa badhane lage
 This is the reason that due to the fans till now, the business was to be done or else this film would have proved to be a big box closed

 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the Prime Minister's signed letter is being sent to the people, saying that you have been selected for free treatment under Ayushman Bharat, but the Rajasthan government has not yet implemented the scheme
 aise main sawaal uthne laga he ki jinka card modi sarkaar bhej rahi he unke ilaaj kaa paisa koun degaa

 In this, along with a description of the Modi government's plans, it is written that you can treat 5 lakh free of cost through this card
 hakeekat yah he ki is card ke jariye rajasthan main kahin bhi ilaaj nahin ho paaegaa, kyonki yojana abhi tak rajasthan sarkaar ne lagu nahin kiya he

 ) Till some time ago the forests of Budhelkhand remained in the sunshine due to the news that the tiger is devoid, but once again the number of tigers in these forests is increasing rapidly
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki agar van vibhaag kii koshishen kaamyaab raheen or bundelkhand kii aabhohawaa baaghon ko raas aati rahi to koi aashcharya nahin ki is saal ke ant tak yahaan ke jangalon main baaghon kii sankhya badhkar dedh darjan se zyada ho jaayegi
 According to forest department statistics, till about four years ago, the number of tigers in Panna Tiger Reserve alone was 30 to 35, but surprisingly this number reached zero in a few years
 panna tiger rigerv ke nirdeshak aar
 Srinivas Murthy said that there are currently seven tigers in the emerald forests
 inamen se do jawan maadaayen, ek nar baagh tathaa chaar shaavak hai
 According to his plan, three more tigers from other national parks will be brought to the Panna Tiger Reserve in the next few months
 baaghon kii sankhya keval panna tiger rigerv main hi nahin bad rahi he
 Tigers are also seen in the North and South Forests of Sagar circle, Nauradehi Sanctuary and Damoh forests
 sagar ke vansangrakshak ashok bhaatia ne bataaya ki sagar ke uttar vanmandal ke tahat shahgarh ke jangalon main bhi alag-alag samay par nar va maadaa baagh ko dekha gaya he
 Later two cubs were also seen along with the tigress

 Apart from this, recently the tiger has been seen wandering in the area adjoining Katni in the forests of Damoh district
 uske saath ek baghin hone kii bhi soochna he
 Officials of the forest department are not denying that if tigers are experiencing the climate of the forests of Budelkhand, then the tigers from the surrounding forests can also come here
 baaghon kii sankhya main ijapha hone ke saath hi van vibhaag kii chintaae bhi badhati ja raheen hai
 According to officials, the tiger of Panna is more safe than other areas due to being inside the tiger reserve area, but no special arrangements have been made by the department for the protection of tigers in Bundelkhand region
 bhaatia ne bataaya ki bundelkhand ke jangalon main baaghon kii suraksha ke paryaapt intjaam karne kii raah main sabase badi baadha prashikshit vanakarmi nahin hona or dhan kii kami he
 He said that recently the state government has approved the formation of the Tiger Strike Force on the recommendation of the National Tiger Conservation Authority
 unhone bataaya ki is suraksha bal kaa mukhyalay bhopal main hoga, jabaki paanch kshetreey karyaalay indore, satna, itarasi, jabalpur evam sagar jile main sthapit kiye jaayenge
 In Madhya Pradesh, which has achieved the status of tiger state due to the highest number of tigers, how much time will this initiative of the state government prove for the protection of tigers, it will only tell the time to come

 States where the examination has been held and where proposed, may be excluded from the new system this year

 On May 1, under the new system, examination will be done which is called Neet Phase One
 3 may ko is maamle main supreme court main sunwaayee hogi
 The Supreme Court also did not order whether the states would be able to conduct their entrance examinations
 maharashtra sarkaar ne kaha he ki vah 5 may ko hi kaaman entrens test karaayegi
 In Maharashtra, 2 lakh 83 thousand 319 students are participating in the Common Entrance Test
 kya yah samajha jaae ki baaki rajya bhi apni pravesh pariksha yojit kar sakate hai yaa jin rajyon main pravesh parikshaayen ho gayi hai vah maanya hai

 philhal is saal lagu hone se kya dikkatein aa rahi hai ham isi par sawaal jawaab karenge
 The pattern and preparation strategy of AIPMT and other exams also vary
 jaise chhattisgarh ke ek chaatr ne bataaya ki unke yahaan negative marking nahin he
 Physics and chemistry of number 100 and biology and zoology of number 100
 eipamti main 720 number kaa imtahaan hota he or negative marking hoti he
 Someone told that thirty percent of the numbers in Bihar are from NCERT, the rest from the state syllabus
 jabaki eipamti main 80 fisadi ensiiarti se hota he
 There is so much diversity in the systems
 chhattisgarh se ladke ke pita ne bataaya ki ek may kii pariksha main vah shaamil nahin ho sakegaa, kyonki uski sari taiyaari raipur medical college main jagah paane ko lekar thi
 News of this kind of panic is being received from many places
 aisi ghabrahat to hameshaa rahegi magar imtahaan ke kareeb pariksha pranali main badlaav par ek baar vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Whatever it is, the Supreme Court has not changed the order
 1 may ko eipamti kii pariksha hogi, jisamen desh bhar ke saadhe chah lakh parikshaarthi hissaa lenge
 One such problem is that of Tamil Nadu, which said in the court that it has a system of admission to medical on the basis of the result of 12th class
 aise main uske lakhon chaatr baahar rah jaaenge
 Then the Assistant Attorney General said that 15,000 students from Tamil Nadu are also joining AIPMT
 guuruuvaar ko centre sarkaar ek pariksha kii baat kar rahi thi, shuukravaar ko isamen is saal ke liye sanshodhan kii maang karne lagi
 The question should be whether a single student is missing out on this sudden change
 agar chhot rahaa he to rajya ko uski chintaa kerani chahie
 On Thursday, the Supreme Court implemented a system in the entire country, which is expected to check many complaints related to the entrance examination
 sankalp cheritable trust banaam bharat sarkaar va anya cese main paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne faisla diya ki ab se desh main medical kii ek hi pravesh pariksha hogi

 Most parties agreed to it
 aap jaanate hai ki neet kii pariksha ke liye medical council of india or dental council aaf india ne 21 disambar 2010 ko ek notification jari kiya tha
 According to the order of the Supreme Court, different states or colleges will not be able to conduct their entrance examination
 jaise karnataka main privet medical college association apni taraf se pariksha yojit nahin kara sakegaa
 NEET exam will be conducted in two stages
 jo chaatr 1 may ko dena chahen wo de sakate hai
 Students who have not applied for AIPMT can apply new
 or 24 july ko hone vaali neet fez tu kii pariksha main shaamil ho sakate hai
 The results of both will come on 17 August and the process of admission will be completed by 30 September

 The comments darasal hai court ne kaha tha ki dilli sarkaar ko bijli companiyon ke khaaton kaa sieji se audit karaane kaa adhikaar nahin he kyonki pehle hi iske liye DERC yani dilli electricity regulatory kamishan banaaya gaya he jo unke hisaab kitaab par najar rakhata he

 In fact, the High Court had said that the Delhi government does not have the right to conduct a CAG audit of the accounts of the power companies as DERC i

 companiyon ne daleel di thi ki wo nijee kshetra kii companiyaan hai isliye unka sieji se audit nahin karaayaa ja saktaa
 Whereas Delhi government had argued that the government also has partnership with the power companies and they can be audited due to their involvement with the public

 He has clearly told the Home Minister Rajnath Singh
 sambhav hoga to sabhi ek saath rahenge

 Open master ipel kii sabase kaamyaab ballebaaji jodi koun si he? cricketpremiyon ke liye is sawaal kaa jawaab dena bahut kathin nahin he
 Sunrisers' David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan are setting records with their batting season-by-season
 ipel10 main is jodi ne lagaataar teesri baar 600 se adhik ran apni saajhedaari main jode hai
 warner-shikhar has added 646 runs for the first wicket so far this season and has contributed significantly to the Sunrisers' success in the tournament
 isse pehle pichley sijan yani varsh 2016 main in donon ne 731 or varsh 2015 main 622 ran jode the
 The comments ipel ke lagaataar teen sijan main is tarah ranon kaa ambara lagaana aasaan nahin he, lekin baayen haath ke in donon ballebaajon ne is kaam ko bakhubi kar dikhaaya he
 By the way, the record of adding the most runs as a pair in a season of IPL is to Royal Challengers Bangalore AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli, who added 939 runs showing tremendous form in the last season
 suchi main pehle sthaan par duniya ke do dhakad ballebaaj abi or kohli hi kabiz hai, lekin pradarshan main sthirataa ke maamle main nishchit rup se warner-dhawan ko in par baari mana ja saktaa he
 These two Sunrisers batsmen have crossed the 600-year barrier for three consecutive years to prove that they are unmatched in strengthening the foundation of the team by creating consistent partnerships
 600 ran kaa barier paar karne main mumbai indiens ke landal simons or parthiv patel kii jodi bhi kam nahin rahi
 Both of them combined for 615 runs in the 2015 season
 isi tarah eron finch or robin uthppa ne pune varirs ne 2013 sijan main 606 ran jode the
 It is not easy to score runs in this manner in three consecutive seasons of IPL, but both these left-handed batsmen have shown this feat well
 vaise, ipel ke ek sijan main jodi ke rup main sarvaadhik ran jodne kaa record royal chalangers bengaluru ke abi divilliars or viraat kohli ke naam he jinhone pichley sijan main jabardast form dikhaate hue 939 ran jode the
 AB and Kohli occupy the world's top two batsmen in the list, but warner-dhawan can certainly be considered heavy in terms of consistency in performance
 sunrisers ke in donon ballebaajon ne lagaataar teen varsh 600 ran ke barier ko paar karke sabit kiya he ki lagaataar saajhedaari rachakar team kii neenv majboot karne main ye bejod hai
 The Mumbai Indians pair of Lendl Simmons and Parthiv Patel were also no less in crossing the 600-run barrier
 in donon ne 2015 sijan main 615 ran milakar jode the
 Similarly, Aaron Finch and Robin Uthappa had added 606 runs in the 2013 season by Pune Warriors
 600 ran kaa barier paar karne main mumbai indiens ke landal simons or parthiv patel kii jodi bhi kam nahin rahi

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh apni kursi par 3,000 se zyada din guzaar chuke hai
 Except for members of the nehru-gandhi family in Indian politics, no one has enjoyed such happiness so far
 aaj jab apane kaarykaal ke dhalate suraj kaa peechha karte ve aakhri bigha naap rahe hai, to unke khate main sivaay iske koi uplabdhi najar nahin aati ki rashtriya smriti main pabast badnuma ghotaalon se chaitarafa ghire hone ke baavjood ve ab tak bache hue hai

 tab tak ve ek kartavyanishth arthshaastri hua karte the jisane adhiktar vakt apane siyaasi aakaaon ke hit main bitaayaa tha, to unka chunaa janaa bhi lajimi tha
 Nearly a decade has passed since then and today their downfall has become synonymous with the downfall of this country

 iske baavjood manmohan singh ko ek aisi arthvyavastha mili thi jo paryaapt majboot thi or jisamen sarkaar kaa dakhal nunatam tha
 The government was capable of taking this growth story forward except for Manmohan Singh, who was the first Indian economist to become the Prime Minister of India and who is credited with abolishing the License Raj
 lekin unke shuruaati paanch saal main aisa kuch bhi nahin hua
 The man who was away from politics was still learning the rules of the game that the term ended and he became the Congress' best seller in the 2009 general election

 jis vakt desh ko dobaaraa patari par laane vaali takat kii sabase zyada jarurat thi, bharat sarkaar ne uskaa daaman hi chhod diya he
 In the last part of his turtle race, will Manmohan Singh be able to wake up by shaking his inner reformer and become a Sampan Mochan? He still has a tongue in his mouth, although his alphas are actually pointless and escapist

 Perhaps the district officials were not aware that Nitish Kumar's eyes were fixed on the large monitor facing him and they were noticing everything
 iske baad unhonekuch zila adhikariyon ko baatcheet karne paratoka to kuch ko mobile par vyast rahane par
 After this, he advised many district officials to listen carefully to the review of the district of Bagal
 nitish kumaar ke is tarah se chizon ko baariki se note karne par sabhi hairaan the
 However, opponents who have worked with Nitish also believe that when they are reviewing, very few leaders have the same patience as him, especially the patience to listen closely and get into the fold
 vah samiksha baithak main aupchaarikta se bachate hai
 a fresh example of this is chum fever

 However, it is also discussed that if they visited the hospital a few days ago, some more children would have been saved
 maathe par pagadi, gale main bhagava gamchaa, ankhon par safed chashma, kalai par ghadi or har milane vaale kaa abhinandan
 This is the style of Abhinandan Pathak of Saharanpur
 unhen pehle pahal dekhne vaala har insaan unhen narendra modi maanata he
 However, Abhinandan replies by smiling that his motive is only to maintain Modi's presence in public
 log unhen 'junior modi' bulaate hai
 In fact, these days Narendra Modi, the candidate for bjp's PM post, is busy in election preparations
 yahi kaaran he ki kaashi main bijepi kii ore se loksabhaa chunaav ke liye ummidavaar banaae jane ke baad ve varanasi kii janata ke liye vakt nahin nikaal paae hai
 In such a situation these days, 'junior Modi' has maintained a front

 Who is Abhinandan Pathak? 'junior Modi' means Abhinandan Pathak's father is originally from Faizabad
 vah or unka parivaar roji-roti kii talash main saharanpur aae or phir vahiin bas gaye
 The grandest of the three brothers, the nan-map of Abhinandan, matches that of Narendra Modi
 bataaya jaataa he ki bijepi ne jabase pradhanmantri pad ke liye narendra modi kii ummidavaari pakki kii, gharavaalon or sthaneey logon ne abhinandan par dabaav banaaya ki ve varanasi jaakar logon ke bich modi kaa prachaar karen
 Just then, he has been promoting the party in Varanasi as a representative of Modi
 abhinandan kehete hai, 'aaj puure bharat main gujarat ke vikaas kii ganga bah rahi he
 My main purpose of coming here is to maintain Modi ji's presence in public
 'modi kii hi tarah vipaksh par hamalaa bhiaisa nahin he ki abhinandan sirf modi kaa prachaar kar rahe hai
 If anyone questions the opposition during the field tour, they are also attackers on the opposition
 vah aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal ko nishaanaa banane main der nahin lagaate hai or apni bhashaa or style ko bhi modi kii hi tarah dhaalane kaa prayaas karte hai

 Smoke started coming from inside a moving train at Patel Nagar metro station of Delhi Metro
 pehle to musafiron ko kuch samaj nahin aayaa, lekin jab train kii chat se dhuen kaa gubaar uthne laga, to musafiron kii saans atak gai
 The senses of the staff present at the metro station also blew up, because at the time when the ceiling was rising from the roof of the metro, there were hundreds of passengers inside the train
 metro train ko roka gaya or sabhi musafiron ko rajendra place metro stesan par baahar nikaala gaya
 But taking this decision, the metro went from Patel Nagar to Rajendra Place with a gust of smoke
 aise main metro kii laaparvaahee bhi saamne aayi ki aakhir chaar steshnon tak metro ke musafiron kii jaan ko khatre main kyo daalaa gaya
 According to the passengers, the passengers first told about the train driver Kodhuan coming out at Kirtinagar
 lekin tab ise saamaanya ghatana samajhakar nazarandaaz kar diya gaya
 But the light smoke emanating from the AC system reaching Patel Nagar turned into a big bubble
 jab dhuaan gubaar main badal gaya tabhi metro ke staff ko bhi halaat kii gambhirtha kaa ehsaas hua
 Till then the train continued to move along with the passengers and it was decided to take the passengers off the metro by going to Rajendra Place
 ab is puure maamle paradmarsine jaanch baitha di he
 Because according to the rules, when the metro is put on the track for the use of passengers, all the investigation is done and the passengers are allowed to carry it only after everything is fixed
 lekin is metro train ke asi system main na sirf short circuit hua, balki dhuen kaa aisa gubaar uthaa jise saamaanya ghatana nahin kaha ja saktaa
 This matter is also serious because at the time of the incident, more than 1000 passengers were present in the train
 dmarsi sutron ke mutabik jab train khaali kara lee gai or ise mentanence ke liye depo main le jate vakt bhi ek baar phir train ne aag pakad lee
 Abattrocke officers are trying to smuggle in by talking about the investigation, but are refraining from saying whether anyone is accountable at first glance for this negligence
