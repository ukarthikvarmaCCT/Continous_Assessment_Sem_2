 shikshakon ke andolan kii bhi
 The condition of both these movements is very bad

 All are divided and trapped in the framework of Congress BJP and Left

 These students have staged a sit-in in front of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Bhawan on Kalina Campus
 inke binar par yah bhi likhaa he ki shiksha bikaoo nahin he
 Students say that pass all the students, declare the result within ten days
 chaatr likhit aashwaasan maang rahe hai
 And due to the delay in the result, Mumbai University should help in the admission in other institutions which have not been admitted

 The teachers here have alleged that they have not been getting regular salary since 2012
 kabhi miltaa he to kabhi kai maheene ke baad miltaa he

 ye saare mumbai uniwarsity se sambanddh hai
 About five and six thousand students study here

 The Engineering College lab has machines but is closed for two to three years
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he to pani ko jamaa karne ke liye kai jagah plastic kii bottle rakhi mil gai
 The condition of the toilet is also very bad
 aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki lakhon kii fees dekar chaatr kis tip ke ejeeniyar ban rahe hai
 The teachers have covered their helplessness like a dushala, they say that the salary fixed by the government is 65,000 then teachers get 30,000 here
 yahi nahin, yahaan jo post graduage paas karata he, use hi shikshak bana diya jaataa he
 Many teachers have left the college due to non-payment of salary
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ejineering and technalji college main jahaan 111 shikshak the ab 65 hi rah gaye hai
 There are only 6 professors in 26 in the mechanical department
 civil department main 26 main se 8 professor hi hai
 The teachers allege that the college has stopped filling the Provident Form
 in shikshakon ne apane shoshan ke khilaaf college ke management, shiksha mantri, mukhyamantri sabase baat kii, prativedan diya magar mila sirf aashwaasan or bhaashan
 Teachers are saying that if they do not get salary, then they are not able to pay even the school fees of the children
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki is saal maatr 3 maheene kaa vetan nahin mila he
 16 months of salary has been left so far
 jab shikshak hi chaatro ke andolan ko protsaahit nahin karenge to ek din unki bhi haalat yahi ho jaaegi
 There will be no one to speak for those teachers as well
 desh bhar main shikshak sanghon ke patan kii nishaani he ki ab aapako unke zarie uniwarsity kii badtar haalat par koi awaz sunai nahin detaa kyonki sab apane apane dal kii sarkaar main set ho chuke hai
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar chairman Nandu Tasgaonkar has sent his reply via email

 The law is doing its work in the case of PF
 ham aapako aashwast karnaa chaahate hai may 2018 se pehle adhiktam selary kaa bhugtan kar diya jayega
 Most teachers are two to three years old, so how can the right to not get salary since 2011? hamaare yahaan 50 se 60 fisadi chaatr pichhadi or ati pichhadi jati ke hai
 50 to 60 percent of our revenue comes from scholarship and freeship, so salary is related to revenue
 ham 40 fisadi rajasav ke sahare kaise santhaan chalaa sakate hai
 An engineering college of the college has been closed due to lack of students, hence their labs are closed
 ' The chairman also said that how many teachers did you talk to, do you think that talking to 10 percent teachers makes the story genuin, then should you have talked to 100 percent teachers, does it happen, if two The teachers are not getting salary, about which the chairman himself says that maximum salary will be available till May 2018
 nahin mil rahi hogi tabhi to kah rahe hai ki may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 Nevertheless, the Chairman feels that this story is wrong
 chairman sahab ke jawaab main pad kii garima kam dhamkee zyada he
 When they start saying that if you have done the muster roll check of these teachers for five years, you will find that 40 to 70 percent of these times these people are late
 jaldi chale jate hai
 We have done a series on the poor condition of fifty colleges and twenty universities
 chairman sahab pehle hai jo itane kamazor tarkon se apana bachaav kar rahe hai
 If the teacher's salary is not available, then why would anyone lie, if it is not available then give it
 baat khatm
 If the labs are not running, then run them
 ham inke mail ke saare pahalu ko kot nahin kar rahe hai varna chairman sahab kahenge ki ham jitna ghanta bolenge aap utana ghanta dikhaaiye
 Sohit Mishra stands by his report
 chairman sahab ne likhaa he ki ve mere fain hai
 i felt disappointed at such a fan and also request you not to become a fan of anyone, see if the system is getting well or not

 These teachers have been protesting for a month
 ye shikshak bhi apane virodh se pehle chaatr sanghathanon ke pradarshnon par hansaa karte honge, aaj inhen khud pradarshan karnaa pad rahaa he

 Gradually the situation will be fixed
 dhire-dhire ham saare logon kii selary release kar rahe hai
 It is good that the Ghaziabad administration has taken initiative in this matter and after meeting with the college chairman on November 1, an attempt will be made to resolve the problem
 har jagah kii samasya ek hi he magar sab apni apni ladaai lard rahe hai
 The students of Delhi's School of Planning and Architect have got their demands accepted

 The administration has accepted most of the students' demands

 Miran Haider, a student of Jamia Millia Islamia, has been on hunger strike for 7 days
 unke saath kai or chaatr hadtaal par hai or din raat dharne par baith rahe hai
 Meeran Haider and his colleagues demand that when there is a teacher union, there is an employee union then why is there no student union
 jamiya ne ek ranneeti ke tahat chaatr sangh ko khatm kar diya he
 Whenever there is talk of forming a student union, there is a delay
 jab chaatro ke pratinnidhi mandal ne is cese ko lard rahe vakil se mulaakaat kii tab bataa chalaa ki 2011 ke vaais chancelar chaatr sangh nahin chaahate the
 The University is an autonomous institution
 prashasan chaahe to aaj chunaav ho saktaa he jaise jeenyu main hota he
 The VC says that the matter is stuck in the court, but the students say that this is an excuse

 auskar furnandis bhi aae hai
 Many alumni leaders of Jamia are coming

 jamiya main 17000 chaatr padhate hai, yaheen union kii azaadi nahin to yahaan ke chaatr tamaam muddon par abhivyakti kii azaadi kii ladaai kaise ladenge
 Due to not having a student organization, students attending college are unable to raise their voice
 vaise jahaan hai vahaan bhi college main shikshakon ke nahin hone, shikshakon kii niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee, unke kam vetan ko lekar andolan nahin he
 There is silence everywhere
 jo chaatr andolan kar rahe hai wo apane jokhim par kar rahe hai baaki tamaasha dekhte hai tab tak jab tak ve khud kisi shoshan kaa shikaar nahin ho jate or kisi chaatr netaa yaa shikshak netaa kii talash main nahin lag jate
 You need the movement, not the government
 andolan nahin honge to awaz kaise uthegi
 Now imagine where the protest will be at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 tippaniyan By the way, Jantar Mantar will not be available now
 neshnal green tribunel ke aadesh ke baad jantar mantar ko khaali karvaa diya gaya he
 Many demands of the general public have arisen from this small place and have reached the Parliament and Government built from here
 yahaan laudspikar se shor ho rahaa tha to band kar diya gaya
 There is noisy noise from loudspeakers in the street, but there is no place in the name of noise pollution and there is no restlessness in the society
 adaalat kaa aadesh he to police or endiemasi ne sabko bason main thuns kar yahaan se hataa diya
 The echo of the Nirbhaya movement was heard here, Anna Hazare started the movement from here, who would not have performed the BJP Congress Left here
 bahut se kamazor log yahaan dharne par baithe mil jate the ki yahaan aate jate media kii nigaah pad jaae or baat sarkaar tak pahunch jaae
 a command snatched the voice away
 yahaan ab gamale lagaae jaaenge
 Similarly, there were demonstrations behind the Red Fort once before

 aaj aap jaipur ke stechu cirkil ke paas dharna pradarshan nahin kar sakate hai
 There is no place of presentation in the city
 aisa nahin he ki hamen or aap ko pradarshan kii zarurat nahin he, kaayade se har jagah sarkaar ko pradarshan karne kii jagah muft deni chahie, vahaan tak jane ke liye bas deni chahie, har tarah kii suvidha honi chahie kyonki jo pradarshan karata he wo loktantr ko sundar banaata he, jeevant banaata he
 Voting is the last thing in a democracy, the most important thing to do before that is to reach out to a place and raise voice
 isliye jamiya ke chaatro kii maang main dam he ki chaatr sangh hona chahie
 The Students' Union is also the Space of Protest
 13 aktubar ko kerala hai court ne antarim aadesh jari kiya he ki kalege ke campus main protest nahin kiya jayega, kyonki santhaan adhyayan ke liye bane hai, campus ko hadtaal or pradarshan mukt rahanaa chahie

 When they start saying that if you have done the muster roll check of these teachers for five years, you will find that 40 to 70 percent of these times these people are late

 If the teacher's salary is not available, then why would anyone lie, if it is not available then give it

 Sohit Mishra stands by his report

 Due to not having a student organization, students attending college are unable to raise their voice
 vaise jahaan hai vahaan bhi college main shikshakon ke nahin hone, shikshakon kii niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee, unke kam vetan ko lekar andolan nahin he
 There is silence everywhere
 jo chaatr andolan kar rahe hai wo apane jokhim par kar rahe hai baaki tamaasha dekhte hai tab tak jab tak ve khud kisi shoshan kaa shikaar nahin ho jate or kisi chaatr netaa yaa shikshak netaa kii talash main nahin lag jate

 The echo of the Nirbhaya movement was heard here, Anna Hazare started the movement from here, who would not have performed the BJP Congress Left here

 Voting is the last thing in a democracy, the most important thing to do before that is to reach out to a place and raise voice
 isliye jamiya ke chaatro kii maang main dam he ki chaatr sangh hona chahie
 The Students' Union is also the Space of Protest
 13 aktubar ko kerala hai court ne antarim aadesh jari kiya he ki kalege ke campus main protest nahin kiya jayega, kyonki santhaan adhyayan ke liye bane hai, campus ko hadtaal or pradarshan mukt rahanaa chahie

 yojana banane se lekar lagu karne main unki bhagidaari sunishchit kii gai he or yah suraksha di gai he ki is ilaake kaa dohan na ho or shoshan na ho magar aisa kahaan hota he
 The plan goes from Delhi and from there the news of the movement is lost by placing it in a Naxal frame

 Accordingly, the head of this council should also be tribal but the chief minister is there
 yah sanstha rajyapal ko report karti he, rajyapal raashtrapati ko report dete hai ki adivasee ilaake main shoshan or dohan to nahin ho rahaa
 These leaders allege that this council has been disabled so that their resources can be sold for the interests of industrial houses

 That is why i am saying that let the debate of India's democracy come out of the framework of debates thrown by Congress and BJP
 bahut kuch nayaa hota milegaa aapako
 In this 16th issue of the University Series, we will talk about student movements going on in some colleges
 shikshakon ke andolan kii bhi
 The condition of both these movements is very bad
 uniwarsity series ke dauraan kisi bhi shikshak sangh ne is baat kii zarurat nahin samajhi ki sampark kar or bhi jaankaree di jaae
 All are divided and trapped in the framework of Congress BJP and Left
 yahi haal chaatr raajnneeti kaa bhi he
 But in many places students are coming out of this framework and fighting their battles
 mumbai uniwarsity bachaao naam se andolan laanch ho gaya he
 Due to online copy checking there has been a delay of months in getting the results and there have been a lot of messes in the results
 mumbai uniwarsity ke chaatr lagaataar andolan kar rahe hai
 On 31 October, banners were brought on which was written Save Mumbai University
 is andolan main purv rajyasabha saansad or purv visi mungekar bhi shaamil ho gaye hai
 These students have staged a sit-in in front of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Bhawan on Kalina Campus
 inke binar par yah bhi likhaa he ki shiksha bikaoo nahin he
 Students say that pass all the students, declare the result within ten days
 chaatr likhit aashwaasan maang rahe hai
 And due to the delay in the result, Mumbai University should help in the admission in other institutions which have not been admitted
 sohit mishra mumbai se sate raigarh zile ke karajat ilaake ke ek privet college yadavarao tasagaonkar college main chal rahe pradarshan kaa gauge lene gaye
 The teachers here have alleged that they have not been getting regular salary since 2012
 kabhi miltaa he to kabhi kai maheene ke baad miltaa he
 Spread over 70 acres, the campus has 2 engineering colleges, a pharmacy college, a polytechnic, a management and a school
 ye saare mumbai uniwarsity se sambanddh hai
 About five and six thousand students study here
 sohit mishra ne dekha ki college to baahar se thik thaak dikhataa he magar andar se haalat karaab he
 The Engineering College lab has machines but is closed for two to three years
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he to pani ko jamaa karne ke liye kai jagah plastic kii bottle rakhi mil gai
 The condition of the toilet is also very bad
 aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki lakhon kii fees dekar chaatr kis tip ke ejeeniyar ban rahe hai
 The teachers have covered their helplessness like a dushala, they say that the salary fixed by the government is 65,000 then teachers get 30,000 here
 yahi nahin, yahaan jo post graduage paas karata he, use hi shikshak bana diya jaataa he
 Many teachers have left the college due to non-payment of salary
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ejineering and technalji college main jahaan 111 shikshak the ab 65 hi rah gaye hai
 There are only 6 professors in 26 in the mechanical department
 civil department main 26 main se 8 professor hi hai
 The teachers allege that the college has stopped filling the Provident Form
 in shikshakon ne apane shoshan ke khilaaf college ke management, shiksha mantri, mukhyamantri sabase baat kii, prativedan diya magar mila sirf aashwaasan or bhaashan
 Teachers are saying that if they do not get salary, then they are not able to pay even the school fees of the children
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki is saal maatr 3 maheene kaa vetan nahin mila he
 16 months of salary has been left so far
 jab shikshak hi chaatro ke andolan ko protsaahit nahin karenge to ek din unki bhi haalat yahi ho jaaegi
 There will be no one to speak for those teachers as well
 desh bhar main shikshak sanghon ke patan kii nishaani he ki ab aapako unke zarie uniwarsity kii badtar haalat par koi awaz sunai nahin detaa kyonki sab apane apane dal kii sarkaar main set ho chuke hai
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar chairman Nandu Tasgaonkar has sent his reply via email

 He is sad about why Sohit did not tell the management before leaving
 aap hi sochie, ham bataa kar jate to prabandhan kya apane shikshakon ke paas le jaataa ki haa ji ab bolie ki aapako selary nahin mil rahi he
 Chairman Nandu ji has written that he is being targeted due to being a backward caste
 unka kahana he ki 'shikshakon ke saare aarope aadharahin or tathyaheen hai
 The law is doing its work in the case of PF
 ham aapako aashwast karnaa chaahate hai may 2018 se pehle adhiktam selary kaa bhugtan kar diya jayega
 Most teachers are two to three years old, so how can the right to not get salary since 2011? hamaare yahaan 50 se 60 fisadi chaatr pichhadi or ati pichhadi jati ke hai
 50 to 60 percent of our revenue comes from scholarship and freeship, so salary is related to revenue
 ham 40 fisadi rajasav ke sahare kaise santhaan chalaa sakate hai
 An engineering college of the college has been closed due to lack of students, hence their labs are closed
 ' The chairman also said that how many teachers did you talk to, do you think that talking to 10 percent teachers makes the story genuin, then should you have talked to 100 percent teachers, does it happen, if two The teachers are not getting salary, about which the chairman himself says that maximum salary will be available till May 2018

 The teachers movement too

 During the University Series, no teachers' union thought it necessary to contact and give more information

 The same situation is with student politics
 magar kai jagahon par chaatr is fremawork se baahar aakar apni ladaai lard rahe hai
 The movement has been launched by the name of Mumbai University Bachao

 Sohit Mishra went to observe the ongoing demonstration at Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College, a private college in Karjat area of raigad district adjoining Mumbai
 yahaan ke shikshakon kaa aarope he ki unhen 2012 se hi niyamit rup se vetan nahin miltaa he
 Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get it after several months
 70 acre main faile is campus main 2 ejineering college he, ek farmesi college he, ek polytechnic, ek manjament or ek skool bhi he
 These are all related to Mumbai University
 yahaan kareeb saadhe paanch se chah hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 Sohit Mishra saw that the college looks fine from outside but the condition is bad from inside
 enginirinring college ke lab main mashine to hai magar do teen saal se band hai
 When the roof drips during the rainy season, plastic bottles were found in many places to store water
 shauchalay kii haalat bhi bahut karaab he
 You can guess what type of students are becoming engineers by paying fees of millions
 shikshakon ne apni laachaari ko dushaala kii tarah odh liya he, unka kahana he ki sarkaar se tay vetan 65,000 he to yahaan shikshakon ko 30,000 miltaa he
 Not only this, the post graduate who passes here is made a teacher
 vetan na milane ke kaaran kai shikshakon ne college chhod diya he
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College of Engineering and Technology, where there were 111 teachers, is now 65
 mecanical department main 26 main sirf 6 professor rah gaye hai
 There are only 8 out of 26 professors in the civil department
 shikshakon kaa aarope he ki college ne providend farm bharna band kar diya he
 These teachers spoke against their exploitation, the management of the college, the education minister, the chief minister, gave the report but got only the assurance and speech
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki selary nahin milti he to ve bacchon kii skool fees tak nahin bhar paa rahe hai
 Teachers are saying that this year only 3 months salary has not been received
 abhi tak 16 maheene kaa vetan baaki ho chukaa he
 When teachers will not encourage the students' movement, then one day their condition will also be same
 un shikshakon ke liye bhi bolne vaala koi nahin rahegaa
 It is a sign of the decline of teacher unions across the country that you no longer hear a voice through them on the worsening condition of the university because everyone has been set in the government of his party
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ke chairman nandu tasganvkar ne email ke zarie apana jawaab bheja he
 It is written in response that they are watching the Universi series, but would not have thought that we would reach them
 inhen is baat kaa dukh he ki sohit ne jane se pehle prabandhan ko kyon nahin bataaya
 Think of yourself, if we had told, would the management take it to its teachers that yes, now say that you are not getting salary
 chairman nandu ji ne likhaa he ki unhen pichhadi jati ke hone ke kaaran nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 He says that 'all the allegations of teachers are baseless and factless

 We have 50 to 60 percent students backward and very backward caste
 hamaara 50 se 60 fisadi rajasav scolership or friship se aata he to isliye selary kaa sambandh rajasav se he
 How can we run an institution with 40% revenue? chaatro kii sankhya nahin hone ke kaaran college kaa ek ejineering college band kar diya gaya he isliye unke lab band hai
 ' chairman ne yah bhi kaha ki aapane kitne shikshakon se baat kii, kya aapako lagata he ki 10 fisadi shikshakon se baat kar lene se story jenuin ho jaati he, to kya sau fisadi shikshakon se baat kerani chahie thi, kya aisa hota he, agar do hi shikshakon ko selary nahin mil rahi he jiske bare main khud chairman kehete hai ki adhiktam selary may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 If we are not getting it then we are saying that we will get it by May 2018
 phir bhi chairman sahab ko lagata he ki ye story galat he
 The dignity of the post is less threatening in response to the Chairman
 ve jab yah kehane lagate hai ki kya aapane in shikshakon kaa paanch saal muster role check kiya he, inamen se aap paaenge ki inamen se 40 se 70 fisadi baar ye log let aate hai
 Go away quickly

 There are 17000 students studying in Jamia, if not the freedom of the union here, then how will the students here fight for freedom of expression on all issues
 chaatr sanghathan nahin hone se college main jane vaale chaatr awaz nahin uthaa pate
 By the way, where there are no teachers in the college, there is no movement for rigging the appointments of teachers, their low salaries
 har taraf chuppi he
 The students who are agitating are doing it at their own risk and watch the rest of the spectacle until they themselves become victims of exploitation and start looking for any student leader or teacher leader
 andolan kii zarurat aapako he, sarkaar ko nahin
 If there are no movements then how will the voice be raised
 ab sochie dilli main pradarshan jantar mantar par nahin hoga to kahaan hoga

 mazdoor kisaan shakti sanghathan ke nikhil de ne bataaya ki jaipur ke stechu cirkil main 55-55 dinon kaa dharna chalaa
 The city came to know, people connected and the country came to know that any right like right to information can be obtained, a law like MNREGA can be made

 vot dena loktantr main sabase aakhri kaam he, usase pehle jo sabase zaruri kaam he, lagaataar kisi jagah par pahunch kar awaz uthaanaa
 Hence the demand of Jamia students that there should be a student union

 yojana banane se lekar lagu karne main unki bhagidaari sunishchit kii gai he or yah suraksha di gai he ki is ilaake kaa dohan na ho or shoshan na ho magar aisa kahaan hota he
 The plan goes from Delhi and from there the news of the movement is lost by placing it in a Naxal frame

 Heera Lal Alava decided that he would wake up the doctors as well as the tribal society students about the Fifth Schedule

 Accordingly, the head of this council should also be tribal but the chief minister is there

 These leaders allege that this council has been disabled so that their resources can be sold for the interests of industrial houses

 Recently there have also been student union elections

 That is why i am saying that let the debate of India's democracy come out of the framework of debates thrown by Congress and BJP
 bahut kuch nayaa hota milegaa aapako
 In this 16th issue of the University Series, we will talk about student movements going on in some colleges
 shikshakon ke andolan kii bhi
 The condition of both these movements is very bad
 uniwarsity series ke dauraan kisi bhi shikshak sangh ne is baat kii zarurat nahin samajhi ki sampark kar or bhi jaankaree di jaae
 All are divided and trapped in the framework of Congress BJP and Left
 yahi haal chaatr raajnneeti kaa bhi he
 But in many places students are coming out of this framework and fighting their battles
 mumbai uniwarsity bachaao naam se andolan laanch ho gaya he
 Due to online copy checking there has been a delay of months in getting the results and there have been a lot of messes in the results
 mumbai uniwarsity ke chaatr lagaataar andolan kar rahe hai
 On 31 October, banners were brought on which was written Save Mumbai University
 is andolan main purv rajyasabha saansad or purv visi mungekar bhi shaamil ho gaye hai
 These students have staged a sit-in in front of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Bhawan on Kalina Campus
 inke binar par yah bhi likhaa he ki shiksha bikaoo nahin he
 Students say that pass all the students, declare the result within ten days
 chaatr likhit aashwaasan maang rahe hai
 And due to the delay in the result, Mumbai University should help in the admission in other institutions which have not been admitted
 sohit mishra mumbai se sate raigarh zile ke karajat ilaake ke ek privet college yadavarao tasagaonkar college main chal rahe pradarshan kaa gauge lene gaye
 The teachers here have alleged that they have not been getting regular salary since 2012
 kabhi miltaa he to kabhi kai maheene ke baad miltaa he
 Spread over 70 acres, the campus has 2 engineering colleges, a pharmacy college, a polytechnic, a management and a school
 ye saare mumbai uniwarsity se sambanddh hai
 About five and six thousand students study here
 sohit mishra ne dekha ki college to baahar se thik thaak dikhataa he magar andar se haalat karaab he
 The Engineering College lab has machines but is closed for two to three years
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he to pani ko jamaa karne ke liye kai jagah plastic kii bottle rakhi mil gai
 The condition of the toilet is also very bad
 aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki lakhon kii fees dekar chaatr kis tip ke ejeeniyar ban rahe hai
 The teachers have covered their helplessness like a dushala, they say that the salary fixed by the government is 65,000 then teachers get 30,000 here
 yahi nahin, yahaan jo post graduage paas karata he, use hi shikshak bana diya jaataa he
 Many teachers have left the college due to non-payment of salary
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ejineering and technalji college main jahaan 111 shikshak the ab 65 hi rah gaye hai
 There are only 6 professors in 26 in the mechanical department
 civil department main 26 main se 8 professor hi hai
 The teachers allege that the college has stopped filling the Provident Form
 in shikshakon ne apane shoshan ke khilaaf college ke management, shiksha mantri, mukhyamantri sabase baat kii, prativedan diya magar mila sirf aashwaasan or bhaashan
 Teachers are saying that if they do not get salary, then they are not able to pay even the school fees of the children
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki is saal maatr 3 maheene kaa vetan nahin mila he
 16 months of salary has been left so far
 jab shikshak hi chaatro ke andolan ko protsaahit nahin karenge to ek din unki bhi haalat yahi ho jaaegi
 There will be no one to speak for those teachers as well
 desh bhar main shikshak sanghon ke patan kii nishaani he ki ab aapako unke zarie uniwarsity kii badtar haalat par koi awaz sunai nahin detaa kyonki sab apane apane dal kii sarkaar main set ho chuke hai
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar chairman Nandu Tasgaonkar has sent his reply via email
 jawaab main likhaa he ki ve uniwarsi series dekh rahe hai magar ye nahin sochaa hoga ki ham unheen tak pahunch jaaenge
 He is sad about why Sohit did not tell the management before leaving
 aap hi sochie, ham bataa kar jate to prabandhan kya apane shikshakon ke paas le jaataa ki haa ji ab bolie ki aapako selary nahin mil rahi he
 Chairman Nandu ji has written that he is being targeted due to being a backward caste
 unka kahana he ki 'shikshakon ke saare aarope aadharahin or tathyaheen hai
 The law is doing its work in the case of PF
 ham aapako aashwast karnaa chaahate hai may 2018 se pehle adhiktam selary kaa bhugtan kar diya jayega
 Most teachers are two to three years old, so how can the right to not get salary since 2011? hamaare yahaan 50 se 60 fisadi chaatr pichhadi or ati pichhadi jati ke hai
 50 to 60 percent of our revenue comes from scholarship and freeship, so salary is related to revenue
 ham 40 fisadi rajasav ke sahare kaise santhaan chalaa sakate hai
 An engineering college of the college has been closed due to lack of students, hence their labs are closed
 ' The chairman also said that how many teachers did you talk to, do you think that talking to 10 percent teachers makes the story genuin, then should you have talked to 100 percent teachers, does it happen, if two The teachers are not getting salary, about which the chairman himself says that maximum salary will be available till May 2018
 nahin mil rahi hogi tabhi to kah rahe hai ki may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 Nevertheless, the Chairman feels that this story is wrong
 chairman sahab ke jawaab main pad kii garima kam dhamkee zyada he
 When they start saying that if you have done the muster roll check of these teachers for five years, you will find that 40 to 70 percent of these times these people are late
 jaldi chale jate hai
 We have done a series on the poor condition of fifty colleges and twenty universities
 chairman sahab pehle hai jo itane kamazor tarkon se apana bachaav kar rahe hai
 If the teacher's salary is not available, then why would anyone lie, if it is not available then give it
 baat khatm
 If the labs are not running, then run them
 ham inke mail ke saare pahalu ko kot nahin kar rahe hai varna chairman sahab kahenge ki ham jitna ghanta bolenge aap utana ghanta dikhaaiye
 Sohit Mishra stands by his report
 chairman sahab ne likhaa he ki ve mere fain hai
 i felt disappointed at such a fan and also request you not to become a fan of anyone, see if the system is getting well or not

 These teachers have been protesting for a month

 It is good that the Ghaziabad administration has taken initiative in this matter and after meeting with the college chairman on November 1, an attempt will be made to resolve the problem
 har jagah kii samasya ek hi he magar sab apni apni ladaai lard rahe hai
 The students of Delhi's School of Planning and Architect have got their demands accepted
 somvaar raat paune nau baje yani prime time shuru hone se pehle chaatro ne andolan samaapti kaa elaan kar diya
 The administration has accepted most of the students' demands

 Meeran Haider and his colleagues demand that when there is a teacher union, there is an employee union then why is there no student union
 jamiya ne ek ranneeti ke tahat chaatr sangh ko khatm kar diya he
 Whenever there is talk of forming a student union, there is a delay
 jab chaatro ke pratinnidhi mandal ne is cese ko lard rahe vakil se mulaakaat kii tab bataa chalaa ki 2011 ke vaais chancelar chaatr sangh nahin chaahate the
 The University is an autonomous institution
 prashasan chaahe to aaj chunaav ho saktaa he jaise jeenyu main hota he
 The VC says that the matter is stuck in the court, but the students say that this is an excuse
 shamsi mustafa or imran ahamed bhi bhukh hadtaal par baithe the jinhen aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 MP Ali Anwar has also come in support of this Jamia movement
 auskar furnandis bhi aae hai
 Many alumni leaders of Jamia are coming
 diu se bhi ratan laal or sachin narayan yahaan bhaashan de chuke hai
 jnu's student organization and teachers' organization have also lent their support
 jamiya main 17000 chaatr padhate hai, yaheen union kii azaadi nahin to yahaan ke chaatr tamaam muddon par abhivyakti kii azaadi kii ladaai kaise ladenge
 Due to not having a student organization, students attending college are unable to raise their voice
 vaise jahaan hai vahaan bhi college main shikshakon ke nahin hone, shikshakon kii niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee, unke kam vetan ko lekar andolan nahin he
 There is silence everywhere
 jo chaatr andolan kar rahe hai wo apane jokhim par kar rahe hai baaki tamaasha dekhte hai tab tak jab tak ve khud kisi shoshan kaa shikaar nahin ho jate or kisi chaatr netaa yaa shikshak netaa kii talash main nahin lag jate
 You need the movement, not the government
 andolan nahin honge to awaz kaise uthegi
 Now imagine where the protest will be at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 tippaniyan By the way, Jantar Mantar will not be available now
 neshnal green tribunel ke aadesh ke baad jantar mantar ko khaali karvaa diya gaya he
 Many demands of the general public have arisen from this small place and have reached the Parliament and Government built from here
 yahaan laudspikar se shor ho rahaa tha to band kar diya gaya
 There is noisy noise from loudspeakers in the street, but there is no place in the name of noise pollution and there is no restlessness in the society
 adaalat kaa aadesh he to police or endiemasi ne sabko bason main thuns kar yahaan se hataa diya
 The echo of the Nirbhaya movement was heard here, Anna Hazare started the movement from here, who would not have performed the BJP Congress Left here
 bahut se kamazor log yahaan dharne par baithe mil jate the ki yahaan aate jate media kii nigaah pad jaae or baat sarkaar tak pahunch jaae
 a command snatched the voice away
 yahaan ab gamale lagaae jaaenge
 Similarly, there were demonstrations behind the Red Fort once before
 maine khud cover kiya he magar vahaan bhi pradarshan band kar diya gaya
 The park was created
 vot club par raily kii tasviir aapako veepi singh, devilal, choudhary charan singh, sharad yadav, lalu yadav, nitish kumaar kiske ghar par nahin hogi, magar vahaan to kab se yah sab band ho chukaa he
 The NGT has not given any other place but has said that the movement will go to another place like Kari Ramlila Maidan
 12 acre ke ramlila maidan main ek din ke pradarshan kaa kiraaya 50,000 rupaya he
 With this MCD earns 3 to 4 crores in a year
 wo ise muft main nahin dena chaahati he
 MCD is the institution of democracy, its representatives come from the public and they are now saying that they will not give grounds to perform free
 spes of protest, pradarshan kii jagah kaa sthaan loktantr main janata kii sansad ke samaan hota he
 Nikhil Dey of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan told that there was a 55-55 days' strike in the Statue Circle of Jaipur
 shahar ko pataa chalaa, log jude or desh ko pataa chalaa ki soochna ke adhikaar jaisaa koi adhikaar mil saktaa he, manaregaa jaisaa kanoon ban saktaa he
 Nikhil said that when the UPA wanted to make any amendment in the RTI first year, there was a protest against it at Jantar Mantar and when he won, his partner Shankar wrote a song called Jantar ki Mantar ki Jai Jai Bolo
 aaj aap jaipur ke stechu cirkil ke paas dharna pradarshan nahin kar sakate hai
 There is no place of presentation in the city
 aisa nahin he ki hamen or aap ko pradarshan kii zarurat nahin he, kaayade se har jagah sarkaar ko pradarshan karne kii jagah muft deni chahie, vahaan tak jane ke liye bas deni chahie, har tarah kii suvidha honi chahie kyonki jo pradarshan karata he wo loktantr ko sundar banaata he, jeevant banaata he
 Voting is the last thing in a democracy, the most important thing to do before that is to reach out to a place and raise voice
 isliye jamiya ke chaatro kii maang main dam he ki chaatr sangh hona chahie
 The Students' Union is also the Space of Protest
 13 aktubar ko kerala hai court ne antarim aadesh jari kiya he ki kalege ke campus main protest nahin kiya jayega, kyonki santhaan adhyayan ke liye bane hai, campus ko hadtaal or pradarshan mukt rahanaa chahie
 With this, a new organization and new youth arise in Madhya Pradesh
 baad main kya hoga, koun inke bich foot daal degaa, kharid legaa, ye sab to hoga magar dhar bhojashala vivaad ke kshetra main inaki ye kamyaabi maamuli nahin he
 According to the Fifth Schedule, tribal dominated areas are privileged
 yojana banane se lekar lagu karne main unki bhagidaari sunishchit kii gai he or yah suraksha di gai he ki is ilaake kaa dohan na ho or shoshan na ho magar aisa kahaan hota he
 The plan goes from Delhi and from there the news of the movement is lost by placing it in a Naxal frame
 dow
 Heera Lal Alava decided that he would wake up the doctors as well as the tribal society students about the Fifth Schedule
 dilli kaa lobh chhod kar dhar chale gaye
 He was accompanied by Arvind Muzalda of the Birsa Brigade

 You are looking at the picture of these leaders
 dow
 Heera Lal said that there is a provision for a Tribal Advisory Council under the fifth schedule
 jiske sadsy anusuchit janajati ke saansad or vidhayak hote hai
 Accordingly, the head of this council should also be tribal but the chief minister is there
 yah sanstha rajyapal ko report karti he, rajyapal raashtrapati ko report dete hai ki adivasee ilaake main shoshan or dohan to nahin ho rahaa
 These leaders allege that this council has been disabled so that their resources can be sold for the interests of industrial houses
 paanchavi anusoochi ko lekar rajasthan ke bhil bahul ilaake main bhi halchal he
 Recently there have also been student union elections
 dilli kii media main abivipi or esefai yaa enesayuai ke jeetne kii hi khabar ai magar aap patrika akhbaar ke sanskaran ko dekhie
 The news is talking about the calling of a new organization
 duungarpur, sagawada, simalwada, ke chaaron college main adhyaksh, upaadhyaksh, mahasachiv, sanyukt sachiv ke chaaron padon par bhil pradesh vidhyaarthee morcha jeeta he
 This front is also vocal about the fifth schedule
 haal hi main yah sanghathan khadaa hua he
 Bhil demands the territory
 bhil pradesh vidhyaarthee morcha ne chaar-chaar college main abivipi or enesayuai ko takkar di he
 That is why i am saying that let the debate of India's democracy come out of the framework of debates thrown by Congress and BJP
 bahut kuch nayaa hota milegaa aapako
 In this 16th issue of the University Series, we will talk about student movements going on in some colleges
 shikshakon ke andolan kii bhi
 The condition of both these movements is very bad
 uniwarsity series ke dauraan kisi bhi shikshak sangh ne is baat kii zarurat nahin samajhi ki sampark kar or bhi jaankaree di jaae
 All are divided and trapped in the framework of Congress BJP and Left
 yahi haal chaatr raajnneeti kaa bhi he
 But in many places students are coming out of this framework and fighting their battles
 mumbai uniwarsity bachaao naam se andolan laanch ho gaya he
 Due to online copy checking there has been a delay of months in getting the results and there have been a lot of messes in the results
 mumbai uniwarsity ke chaatr lagaataar andolan kar rahe hai
 On 31 October, banners were brought on which was written Save Mumbai University
 is andolan main purv rajyasabha saansad or purv visi mungekar bhi shaamil ho gaye hai
 These students have staged a sit-in in front of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Bhawan on Kalina Campus
 inke binar par yah bhi likhaa he ki shiksha bikaoo nahin he
 Students say that pass all the students, declare the result within ten days
 chaatr likhit aashwaasan maang rahe hai
 And due to the delay in the result, Mumbai University should help in the admission in other institutions which have not been admitted
 sohit mishra mumbai se sate raigarh zile ke karajat ilaake ke ek privet college yadavarao tasagaonkar college main chal rahe pradarshan kaa gauge lene gaye
 The teachers here have alleged that they have not been getting regular salary since 2012
 kabhi miltaa he to kabhi kai maheene ke baad miltaa he
 Spread over 70 acres, the campus has 2 engineering colleges, a pharmacy college, a polytechnic, a management and a school
 ye saare mumbai uniwarsity se sambanddh hai
 About five and six thousand students study here
 sohit mishra ne dekha ki college to baahar se thik thaak dikhataa he magar andar se haalat karaab he
 The Engineering College lab has machines but is closed for two to three years
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he to pani ko jamaa karne ke liye kai jagah plastic kii bottle rakhi mil gai
 The condition of the toilet is also very bad
 aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki lakhon kii fees dekar chaatr kis tip ke ejeeniyar ban rahe hai
 The teachers have covered their helplessness like a dushala, they say that the salary fixed by the government is 65,000 then teachers get 30,000 here
 yahi nahin, yahaan jo post graduage paas karata he, use hi shikshak bana diya jaataa he
 Many teachers have left the college due to non-payment of salary
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ejineering and technalji college main jahaan 111 shikshak the ab 65 hi rah gaye hai
 There are only 6 professors in 26 in the mechanical department
 civil department main 26 main se 8 professor hi hai
 The teachers allege that the college has stopped filling the Provident Form
 in shikshakon ne apane shoshan ke khilaaf college ke management, shiksha mantri, mukhyamantri sabase baat kii, prativedan diya magar mila sirf aashwaasan or bhaashan
 Teachers are saying that if they do not get salary, then they are not able to pay even the school fees of the children
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki is saal maatr 3 maheene kaa vetan nahin mila he
 16 months of salary has been left so far
 jab shikshak hi chaatro ke andolan ko protsaahit nahin karenge to ek din unki bhi haalat yahi ho jaaegi
 There will be no one to speak for those teachers as well
 desh bhar main shikshak sanghon ke patan kii nishaani he ki ab aapako unke zarie uniwarsity kii badtar haalat par koi awaz sunai nahin detaa kyonki sab apane apane dal kii sarkaar main set ho chuke hai
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar chairman Nandu Tasgaonkar has sent his reply via email
 jawaab main likhaa he ki ve uniwarsi series dekh rahe hai magar ye nahin sochaa hoga ki ham unheen tak pahunch jaaenge
 He is sad about why Sohit did not tell the management before leaving
 aap hi sochie, ham bataa kar jate to prabandhan kya apane shikshakon ke paas le jaataa ki haa ji ab bolie ki aapako selary nahin mil rahi he
 Chairman Nandu ji has written that he is being targeted due to being a backward caste
 unka kahana he ki 'shikshakon ke saare aarope aadharahin or tathyaheen hai
 The law is doing its work in the case of PF
 ham aapako aashwast karnaa chaahate hai may 2018 se pehle adhiktam selary kaa bhugtan kar diya jayega
 Most teachers are two to three years old, so how can the right to not get salary since 2011? hamaare yahaan 50 se 60 fisadi chaatr pichhadi or ati pichhadi jati ke hai
 50 to 60 percent of our revenue comes from scholarship and freeship, so salary is related to revenue
 ham 40 fisadi rajasav ke sahare kaise santhaan chalaa sakate hai
 An engineering college of the college has been closed due to lack of students, hence their labs are closed
 ' The chairman also said that how many teachers did you talk to, do you think that talking to 10 percent teachers makes the story genuin, then should you have talked to 100 percent teachers, does it happen, if two The teachers are not getting salary, about which the chairman himself says that maximum salary will be available till May 2018
 nahin mil rahi hogi tabhi to kah rahe hai ki may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 Nevertheless, the Chairman feels that this story is wrong
 chairman sahab ke jawaab main pad kii garima kam dhamkee zyada he
 When they start saying that if you have done the muster roll check of these teachers for five years, you will find that 40 to 70 percent of these times these people are late
 jaldi chale jate hai
 We have done a series on the poor condition of fifty colleges and twenty universities
 chairman sahab pehle hai jo itane kamazor tarkon se apana bachaav kar rahe hai
 If the teacher's salary is not available, then why would anyone lie, if it is not available then give it
 baat khatm
 If the labs are not running, then run them
 ham inke mail ke saare pahalu ko kot nahin kar rahe hai varna chairman sahab kahenge ki ham jitna ghanta bolenge aap utana ghanta dikhaaiye
 Sohit Mishra stands by his report
 chairman sahab ne likhaa he ki ve mere fain hai
 i felt disappointed at such a fan and also request you not to become a fan of anyone, see if the system is getting well or not

 It is good that the Ghaziabad administration has taken initiative in this matter and after meeting with the college chairman on November 1, an attempt will be made to resolve the problem
 har jagah kii samasya ek hi he magar sab apni apni ladaai lard rahe hai
 The students of Delhi's School of Planning and Architect have got their demands accepted

 The administration has accepted most of the students' demands

 jamiya main 17000 chaatr padhate hai, yaheen union kii azaadi nahin to yahaan ke chaatr tamaam muddon par abhivyakti kii azaadi kii ladaai kaise ladenge
 Due to not having a student organization, students attending college are unable to raise their voice
 vaise jahaan hai vahaan bhi college main shikshakon ke nahin hone, shikshakon kii niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee, unke kam vetan ko lekar andolan nahin he
 There is silence everywhere
 jo chaatr andolan kar rahe hai wo apane jokhim par kar rahe hai baaki tamaasha dekhte hai tab tak jab tak ve khud kisi shoshan kaa shikaar nahin ho jate or kisi chaatr netaa yaa shikshak netaa kii talash main nahin lag jate

 uniwarsity siries ke is 16 wein ank main ham kuch collejon main chal rahe chaatr andolanon kii baat karenge
 The teachers movement too
 in donon andolanon kii haalat bahut karaab he
 During the University Series, no teachers' union thought it necessary to contact and give more information
 sab congress bijepi or left ke fremawork main bante hue hai or fanse hue hai
 The same situation is with student politics
 magar kai jagahon par chaatr is fremawork se baahar aakar apni ladaai lard rahe hai
 The movement has been launched by the name of Mumbai University Bachao
 online copy checking ke kaaran nattejey aane main maheenon kii deree hui he or nattejey main kaaphi gadabadiyaan hui hai

 Sohit Mishra went to observe the ongoing demonstration at Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College, a private college in Karjat area of raigad district adjoining Mumbai
 yahaan ke shikshakon kaa aarope he ki unhen 2012 se hi niyamit rup se vetan nahin miltaa he
 Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get it after several months
 70 acre main faile is campus main 2 ejineering college he, ek farmesi college he, ek polytechnic, ek manjament or ek skool bhi he
 These are all related to Mumbai University
 yahaan kareeb saadhe paanch se chah hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 Sohit Mishra saw that the college looks fine from outside but the condition is bad from inside
 enginirinring college ke lab main mashine to hai magar do teen saal se band hai
 When the roof drips during the rainy season, plastic bottles were found in many places to store water
 shauchalay kii haalat bhi bahut karaab he
 You can guess what type of students are becoming engineers by paying fees of millions
 shikshakon ne apni laachaari ko dushaala kii tarah odh liya he, unka kahana he ki sarkaar se tay vetan 65,000 he to yahaan shikshakon ko 30,000 miltaa he
 Not only this, the post graduate who passes here is made a teacher
 vetan na milane ke kaaran kai shikshakon ne college chhod diya he
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College of Engineering and Technology, where there were 111 teachers, is now 65
 mecanical department main 26 main sirf 6 professor rah gaye hai
 There are only 8 out of 26 professors in the civil department
 shikshakon kaa aarope he ki college ne providend farm bharna band kar diya he
 These teachers spoke against their exploitation, the management of the college, the education minister, the chief minister, gave the report but got only the assurance and speech
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki selary nahin milti he to ve bacchon kii skool fees tak nahin bhar paa rahe hai
 Teachers are saying that this year only 3 months salary has not been received
 abhi tak 16 maheene kaa vetan baaki ho chukaa he
 When teachers will not encourage the students' movement, then one day their condition will also be same
 un shikshakon ke liye bhi bolne vaala koi nahin rahegaa
 It is a sign of the decline of teacher unions across the country that you no longer hear a voice through them on the worsening condition of the university because everyone has been set in the government of his party
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ke chairman nandu tasganvkar ne email ke zarie apana jawaab bheja he
 It is written in response that they are watching the Universi series, but would not have thought that we would reach them
 inhen is baat kaa dukh he ki sohit ne jane se pehle prabandhan ko kyon nahin bataaya
 Think of yourself, if we had told, would the management take it to its teachers that yes, now say that you are not getting salary
 chairman nandu ji ne likhaa he ki unhen pichhadi jati ke hone ke kaaran nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 He says that 'all the allegations of teachers are baseless and factless
 pief ke maamle main kanoon apana kaam kar rahaa he
 We want to assure you that the maximum salary will be paid before May 2018
 zyaadaatar shikshak do teen saal puraane hai to 2011 se selary na milane kii baat kaise sahi ho sakati he
 We have 50 to 60 percent students backward and very backward caste
 hamaara 50 se 60 fisadi rajasav scolership or friship se aata he to isliye selary kaa sambandh rajasav se he
 How can we run an institution with 40% revenue? chaatro kii sankhya nahin hone ke kaaran college kaa ek ejineering college band kar diya gaya he isliye unke lab band hai
 ' chairman ne yah bhi kaha ki aapane kitne shikshakon se baat kii, kya aapako lagata he ki 10 fisadi shikshakon se baat kar lene se story jenuin ho jaati he, to kya sau fisadi shikshakon se baat kerani chahie thi, kya aisa hota he, agar do hi shikshakon ko selary nahin mil rahi he jiske bare main khud chairman kehete hai ki adhiktam selary may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 If we are not getting it then we are saying that we will get it by May 2018
 phir bhi chairman sahab ko lagata he ki ye story galat he
 The dignity of the post is less threatening in response to the Chairman
 ve jab yah kehane lagate hai ki kya aapane in shikshakon kaa paanch saal muster role check kiya he, inamen se aap paaenge ki inamen se 40 se 70 fisadi baar ye log let aate hai
 Go away quickly
 hamane pachaason college or bison uniwarsity kii kharaab haalat par siries kii he
 Chairman Sahib is the first to defend himself from such weak arguments
 shikshak kii selary nahin mil rahi he to koi jhooth kyon bolegaa, nahin mil rahi he to de dijie
 Talk over
 lab nahin chal rahe hai to chalaa dijie
 We are not quoting the entire aspect of their mail, otherwise the Chairman would say that the hour we speak you should show that hour

 vot dena loktantr main sabase aakhri kaam he, usase pehle jo sabase zaruri kaam he, lagaataar kisi jagah par pahunch kar awaz uthaanaa

 The teachers have covered their helplessness like a dushala, they say that the salary fixed by the government is 65,000 then teachers get 30,000 here
 yahi nahin, yahaan jo post graduage paas karata he, use hi shikshak bana diya jaataa he
 Many teachers have left the college due to non-payment of salary
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ejineering and technalji college main jahaan 111 shikshak the ab 65 hi rah gaye hai
 There are only 6 professors in 26 in the mechanical department
 civil department main 26 main se 8 professor hi hai
 The teachers allege that the college has stopped filling the Provident Form
 in shikshakon ne apane shoshan ke khilaaf college ke management, shiksha mantri, mukhyamantri sabase baat kii, prativedan diya magar mila sirf aashwaasan or bhaashan
 Teachers are saying that if they do not get salary, then they are not able to pay even the school fees of the children
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki is saal maatr 3 maheene kaa vetan nahin mila he
 16 months of salary has been left so far
 jab shikshak hi chaatro ke andolan ko protsaahit nahin karenge to ek din unki bhi haalat yahi ho jaaegi

 Most teachers are two to three years old, so how can the right to not get salary since 2011? hamaare yahaan 50 se 60 fisadi chaatr pichhadi or ati pichhadi jati ke hai
 50 to 60 percent of our revenue comes from scholarship and freeship, so salary is related to revenue
 ham 40 fisadi rajasav ke sahare kaise santhaan chalaa sakate hai
 An engineering college of the college has been closed due to lack of students, hence their labs are closed
 ' The chairman also said that how many teachers did you talk to, do you think that talking to 10 percent teachers makes the story genuin, then should you have talked to 100 percent teachers, does it happen, if two The teachers are not getting salary, about which the chairman himself says that maximum salary will be available till May 2018
 nahin mil rahi hogi tabhi to kah rahe hai ki may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 Nevertheless, the Chairman feels that this story is wrong
 chairman sahab ke jawaab main pad kii garima kam dhamkee zyada he
 When they start saying that if you have done the muster roll check of these teachers for five years, you will find that 40 to 70 percent of these times these people are late
 jaldi chale jate hai
 We have done a series on the poor condition of fifty colleges and twenty universities
 chairman sahab pehle hai jo itane kamazor tarkon se apana bachaav kar rahe hai
 If the teacher's salary is not available, then why would anyone lie, if it is not available then give it
 baat khatm
 If the labs are not running, then run them
 ham inke mail ke saare pahalu ko kot nahin kar rahe hai varna chairman sahab kahenge ki ham jitna ghanta bolenge aap utana ghanta dikhaaiye
 Sohit Mishra stands by his report

 Institute records have also been checked in ADM
 shikshakon kaa kahana he ki notebandi ke baas se unhen niyamit selary nahin mil rahi he
 Management is not giving reasons while admissions are also completed
 shikshakon kaa aarope he ki 2013 se pief kaa farm jamaa nahin ho rahaa he
 These teachers have been protesting for a month
 ye shikshak bhi apane virodh se pehle chaatr sanghathanon ke pradarshnon par hansaa karte honge, aaj inhen khud pradarshan karnaa pad rahaa he
 Registrar Dr VP Gupta has ordered that post-graduate and under-graduate studies be discontinued from October 30 until further orders due to unavoidable reasons
 uniwarsity ne apana ek imhataan bhi radd kar diya he
 We spoke to the registrar of Santosh Medical College
 ve pi gupta ne kaha ki pichley saal se piji or bidies kii siten khaali chali gayi hai jisase college aarthik chunautiyon kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 Gradually the situation will be fixed
 dhire-dhire ham saare logon kii selary release kar rahe hai
 It is good that the Ghaziabad administration has taken initiative in this matter and after meeting with the college chairman on November 1, an attempt will be made to resolve the problem
 har jagah kii samasya ek hi he magar sab apni apni ladaai lard rahe hai
 The students of Delhi's School of Planning and Architect have got their demands accepted
 somvaar raat paune nau baje yani prime time shuru hone se pehle chaatro ne andolan samaapti kaa elaan kar diya
 The administration has accepted most of the students' demands
 pichley paanch dinon se yahaan ke chaatr subah shaam pradarshan kar rahe the
 Their main demands were from security to water and sanitation

 Cleanliness was also done
 prashasan ne chaatro ko daraane ke liye parivaar waalon ko bhi patr likhaa
 In which it was said that if your children continue to perform like this, then the semester may be missed
 magar chaatr peeche nahin hate
 He slept in the classroom, did not go to his room
 ab samjhauta ho gaya he or maange maan lee gayi hai
 Miran Haider, a student of Jamia Millia Islamia, has been on hunger strike for 7 days
 unke saath kai or chaatr hadtaal par hai or din raat dharne par baith rahe hai
 Meeran Haider and his colleagues demand that when there is a teacher union, there is an employee union then why is there no student union
 jamiya ne ek ranneeti ke tahat chaatr sangh ko khatm kar diya he
 Whenever there is talk of forming a student union, there is a delay
 jab chaatro ke pratinnidhi mandal ne is cese ko lard rahe vakil se mulaakaat kii tab bataa chalaa ki 2011 ke vaais chancelar chaatr sangh nahin chaahate the
 The University is an autonomous institution
 prashasan chaahe to aaj chunaav ho saktaa he jaise jeenyu main hota he
 The VC says that the matter is stuck in the court, but the students say that this is an excuse
 shamsi mustafa or imran ahamed bhi bhukh hadtaal par baithe the jinhen aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 MP Ali Anwar has also come in support of this Jamia movement
 auskar furnandis bhi aae hai
 Many alumni leaders of Jamia are coming
 diu se bhi ratan laal or sachin narayan yahaan bhaashan de chuke hai
 jnu's student organization and teachers' organization have also lent their support
 jamiya main 17000 chaatr padhate hai, yaheen union kii azaadi nahin to yahaan ke chaatr tamaam muddon par abhivyakti kii azaadi kii ladaai kaise ladenge
 Due to not having a student organization, students attending college are unable to raise their voice
 vaise jahaan hai vahaan bhi college main shikshakon ke nahin hone, shikshakon kii niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee, unke kam vetan ko lekar andolan nahin he
 There is silence everywhere
 jo chaatr andolan kar rahe hai wo apane jokhim par kar rahe hai baaki tamaasha dekhte hai tab tak jab tak ve khud kisi shoshan kaa shikaar nahin ho jate or kisi chaatr netaa yaa shikshak netaa kii talash main nahin lag jate
 You need the movement, not the government
 andolan nahin honge to awaz kaise uthegi
 Now imagine where the protest will be at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 tippaniyan By the way, Jantar Mantar will not be available now
 neshnal green tribunel ke aadesh ke baad jantar mantar ko khaali karvaa diya gaya he
 Many demands of the general public have arisen from this small place and have reached the Parliament and Government built from here
 yahaan laudspikar se shor ho rahaa tha to band kar diya gaya
 There is noisy noise from loudspeakers in the street, but there is no place in the name of noise pollution and there is no restlessness in the society
 adaalat kaa aadesh he to police or endiemasi ne sabko bason main thuns kar yahaan se hataa diya
 The echo of the Nirbhaya movement was heard here, Anna Hazare started the movement from here, who would not have performed the BJP Congress Left here
 bahut se kamazor log yahaan dharne par baithe mil jate the ki yahaan aate jate media kii nigaah pad jaae or baat sarkaar tak pahunch jaae
 a command snatched the voice away

 12 acre ke ramlila maidan main ek din ke pradarshan kaa kiraaya 50,000 rupaya he
 With this MCD earns 3 to 4 crores in a year

 Nikhil Dey of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan told that there was a 55-55 days' strike in the Statue Circle of Jaipur
 shahar ko pataa chalaa, log jude or desh ko pataa chalaa ki soochna ke adhikaar jaisaa koi adhikaar mil saktaa he, manaregaa jaisaa kanoon ban saktaa he
 Nikhil said that when the UPA wanted to make any amendment in the RTI first year, there was a protest against it at Jantar Mantar and when he won, his partner Shankar wrote a song called Jantar ki Mantar ki Jai Jai Bolo
 aaj aap jaipur ke stechu cirkil ke paas dharna pradarshan nahin kar sakate hai
 There is no place of presentation in the city
 aisa nahin he ki hamen or aap ko pradarshan kii zarurat nahin he, kaayade se har jagah sarkaar ko pradarshan karne kii jagah muft deni chahie, vahaan tak jane ke liye bas deni chahie, har tarah kii suvidha honi chahie kyonki jo pradarshan karata he wo loktantr ko sundar banaata he, jeevant banaata he
 Voting is the last thing in a democracy, the most important thing to do before that is to reach out to a place and raise voice
 isliye jamiya ke chaatro kii maang main dam he ki chaatr sangh hona chahie
 The Students' Union is also the Space of Protest
 13 aktubar ko kerala hai court ne antarim aadesh jari kiya he ki kalege ke campus main protest nahin kiya jayega, kyonki santhaan adhyayan ke liye bane hai, campus ko hadtaal or pradarshan mukt rahanaa chahie

 Voting is the last thing in a democracy, the most important thing to do before that is to reach out to a place and raise voice
 isliye jamiya ke chaatro kii maang main dam he ki chaatr sangh hona chahie
 The Students' Union is also the Space of Protest
 13 aktubar ko kerala hai court ne antarim aadesh jari kiya he ki kalege ke campus main protest nahin kiya jayega, kyonki santhaan adhyayan ke liye bane hai, campus ko hadtaal or pradarshan mukt rahanaa chahie

 Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get it after several months
 70 acre main faile is campus main 2 ejineering college he, ek farmesi college he, ek polytechnic, ek manjament or ek skool bhi he
 These are all related to Mumbai University
 yahaan kareeb saadhe paanch se chah hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 Sohit Mishra saw that the college looks fine from outside but the condition is bad from inside
 enginirinring college ke lab main mashine to hai magar do teen saal se band hai
 When the roof drips during the rainy season, plastic bottles were found in many places to store water

 Teachers are saying that this year only 3 months salary has not been received
 abhi tak 16 maheene kaa vetan baaki ho chukaa he
 When teachers will not encourage the students' movement, then one day their condition will also be same
 un shikshakon ke liye bhi bolne vaala koi nahin rahegaa
 It is a sign of the decline of teacher unions across the country that you no longer hear a voice through them on the worsening condition of the university because everyone has been set in the government of his party

 We have 50 to 60 percent students backward and very backward caste
 hamaara 50 se 60 fisadi rajasav scolership or friship se aata he to isliye selary kaa sambandh rajasav se he
 How can we run an institution with 40% revenue? chaatro kii sankhya nahin hone ke kaaran college kaa ek ejineering college band kar diya gaya he isliye unke lab band hai
 ' chairman ne yah bhi kaha ki aapane kitne shikshakon se baat kii, kya aapako lagata he ki 10 fisadi shikshakon se baat kar lene se story jenuin ho jaati he, to kya sau fisadi shikshakon se baat kerani chahie thi, kya aisa hota he, agar do hi shikshakon ko selary nahin mil rahi he jiske bare main khud chairman kehete hai ki adhiktam selary may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 If we are not getting it then we are saying that we will get it by May 2018

 chaatr sanghathan nahin hone se college main jane vaale chaatr awaz nahin uthaa pate
 By the way, where there are no teachers in the college, there is no movement for rigging the appointments of teachers, their low salaries
 har taraf chuppi he
 The students who are agitating are doing it at their own risk and watch the rest of the spectacle until they themselves become victims of exploitation and start looking for any student leader or teacher leader
 andolan kii zarurat aapako he, sarkaar ko nahin
 If there are no movements then how will the voice be raised

 Spread over 70 acres, the campus has 2 engineering colleges, a pharmacy college, a polytechnic, a management and a school
 ye saare mumbai uniwarsity se sambanddh hai
 About five and six thousand students study here

 The condition of the toilet is also very bad
 aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki lakhon kii fees dekar chaatr kis tip ke ejeeniyar ban rahe hai
 The teachers have covered their helplessness like a dushala, they say that the salary fixed by the government is 65,000 then teachers get 30,000 here
 yahi nahin, yahaan jo post graduage paas karata he, use hi shikshak bana diya jaataa he
 Many teachers have left the college due to non-payment of salary
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ejineering and technalji college main jahaan 111 shikshak the ab 65 hi rah gaye hai
 There are only 6 professors in 26 in the mechanical department
 civil department main 26 main se 8 professor hi hai

 Teachers are saying that if they do not get salary, then they are not able to pay even the school fees of the children
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki is saal maatr 3 maheene kaa vetan nahin mila he
 16 months of salary has been left so far
 jab shikshak hi chaatro ke andolan ko protsaahit nahin karenge to ek din unki bhi haalat yahi ho jaaegi
 There will be no one to speak for those teachers as well
 desh bhar main shikshak sanghon ke patan kii nishaani he ki ab aapako unke zarie uniwarsity kii badtar haalat par koi awaz sunai nahin detaa kyonki sab apane apane dal kii sarkaar main set ho chuke hai

 Most teachers are two to three years old, so how can the right to not get salary since 2011? hamaare yahaan 50 se 60 fisadi chaatr pichhadi or ati pichhadi jati ke hai
 50 to 60 percent of our revenue comes from scholarship and freeship, so salary is related to revenue
 ham 40 fisadi rajasav ke sahare kaise santhaan chalaa sakate hai
 An engineering college of the college has been closed due to lack of students, hence their labs are closed
 ' The chairman also said that how many teachers did you talk to, do you think that talking to 10 percent teachers makes the story genuin, then should you have talked to 100 percent teachers, does it happen, if two The teachers are not getting salary, about which the chairman himself says that maximum salary will be available till May 2018
 nahin mil rahi hogi tabhi to kah rahe hai ki may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 Nevertheless, the Chairman feels that this story is wrong
 chairman sahab ke jawaab main pad kii garima kam dhamkee zyada he
 When they start saying that if you have done the muster roll check of these teachers for five years, you will find that 40 to 70 percent of these times these people are late
 jaldi chale jate hai
 We have done a series on the poor condition of fifty colleges and twenty universities
 chairman sahab pehle hai jo itane kamazor tarkon se apana bachaav kar rahe hai
 If the teacher's salary is not available, then why would anyone lie, if it is not available then give it
 baat khatm
 If the labs are not running, then run them
 ham inke mail ke saare pahalu ko kot nahin kar rahe hai varna chairman sahab kahenge ki ham jitna ghanta bolenge aap utana ghanta dikhaaiye
 Sohit Mishra stands by his report
 chairman sahab ne likhaa he ki ve mere fain hai

 jamiya main 17000 chaatr padhate hai, yaheen union kii azaadi nahin to yahaan ke chaatr tamaam muddon par abhivyakti kii azaadi kii ladaai kaise ladenge
 Due to not having a student organization, students attending college are unable to raise their voice
 vaise jahaan hai vahaan bhi college main shikshakon ke nahin hone, shikshakon kii niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee, unke kam vetan ko lekar andolan nahin he
 There is silence everywhere

 neshnal green tribunel ke aadesh ke baad jantar mantar ko khaali karvaa diya gaya he
 Many demands of the general public have arisen from this small place and have reached the Parliament and Government built from here
 yahaan laudspikar se shor ho rahaa tha to band kar diya gaya
 There is noisy noise from loudspeakers in the street, but there is no place in the name of noise pollution and there is no restlessness in the society
 adaalat kaa aadesh he to police or endiemasi ne sabko bason main thuns kar yahaan se hataa diya
 The echo of the Nirbhaya movement was heard here, Anna Hazare started the movement from here, who would not have performed the BJP Congress Left here
 bahut se kamazor log yahaan dharne par baithe mil jate the ki yahaan aate jate media kii nigaah pad jaae or baat sarkaar tak pahunch jaae
 a command snatched the voice away
 yahaan ab gamale lagaae jaaenge
 Similarly, there were demonstrations behind the Red Fort once before
 maine khud cover kiya he magar vahaan bhi pradarshan band kar diya gaya
 The park was created
 vot club par raily kii tasviir aapako veepi singh, devilal, choudhary charan singh, sharad yadav, lalu yadav, nitish kumaar kiske ghar par nahin hogi, magar vahaan to kab se yah sab band ho chukaa he
 The NGT has not given any other place but has said that the movement will go to another place like Kari Ramlila maidan
the fare 12 acre ke ramlila maidan main ek din ke pradarshan kaa kiraaya 50,000 rupaya he
 With this MCD earns 3 to 4 crores in a year
 wo ise muft main nahin dena chaahati he
 MCD is the institution of democracy, its representatives come from the public and they are now saying that they will not give grounds to perform free
 spes of protest, pradarshan kii jagah kaa sthaan loktantr main janata kii sansad ke samaan hota he
 Nikhil Dey of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan told that there was a 55-55 days' strike in the Statue Circle of Jaipur
 shahar ko pataa chalaa, log jude or desh ko pataa chalaa ki soochna ke adhikaar jaisaa koi adhikaar mil saktaa he, manaregaa jaisaa kanoon ban saktaa he
 Nikhil said that when the UPA wanted to make any amendment in the RTI first year, there was a protest against it at Jantar Mantar and when he won, his partner Shankar wrote a song called Jantar ki Mantar ki Jai Jai Bolo
 aaj aap jaipur ke stechu cirkil ke paas dharna pradarshan nahin kar sakate hai
 There is no place of presentation in the city
 aisa nahin he ki hamen or aap ko pradarshan kii zarurat nahin he, kaayade se har jagah sarkaar ko pradarshan karne kii jagah muft deni chahie, vahaan tak jane ke liye bas deni chahie, har tarah kii suvidha honi chahie kyonki jo pradarshan karata he wo loktantr ko sundar banaata he, jeevant banaata he
 Voting is the last thing in a democracy, the most important thing to do before that is to reach out to a place and raise voice
 isliye jamiya ke chaatro kii maang main dam he ki chaatr sangh hona chahie
 The Students' Union is also the Space of Protest
 13 aktubar ko kerala hai court ne antarim aadesh jari kiya he ki kalege ke campus main protest nahin kiya jayega, kyonki santhaan adhyayan ke liye bane hai, campus ko hadtaal or pradarshan mukt rahanaa chahie
 Spread over 70 acres, the campus has 2 engineering colleges, a pharmacy college, a polytechnic, a management and a school
 ye saare mumbai uniwarsity se sambanddh hai
 About five and six thousand students study here
 sohit mishra ne dekha ki college to baahar se thik thaak dikhataa he magar andar se haalat karaab he
 The Engineering College lab has machines but is closed for two to three years
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he to pani ko jamaa karne ke liye kai jagah plastic kii bottle rakhi mil gai
 The condition of the toilet is also very bad
 aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki lakhon kii fees dekar chaatr kis tip ke ejeeniyar ban rahe hai
 The teachers have covered their helplessness like a dushala, they say that the salary fixed by the government is 65,000 then teachers get 30,000 here
 yahi nahin, yahaan jo post graduage paas karata he, use hi shikshak bana diya jaataa he
 Many teachers have left the college due to non-payment of salary
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ejineering and technalji college main jahaan 111 shikshak the ab 65 hi rah gaye hai
 There are only 6 professors in 26 in the mechanical department
 civil department main 26 main se 8 professor hi hai
 The teachers allege that the college has stopped filling the Provident Form
 in shikshakon ne apane shoshan ke khilaaf college ke management, shiksha mantri, mukhyamantri sabase baat kii, prativedan diya magar mila sirf aashwaasan or bhaashan
 Teachers are saying that if they do not get salary, then they are not able to pay even the school fees of the children
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki is saal maatr 3 maheene kaa vetan nahin mila he
 16 months of salary has been left so far
 jab shikshak hi chaatro ke andolan ko protsaahit nahin karenge to ek din unki bhi haalat yahi ho jaaegi
 There will be no one to speak for those teachers as well
 desh bhar main shikshak sanghon ke patan kii nishaani he ki ab aapako unke zarie uniwarsity kii badtar haalat par koi awaz sunai nahin detaa kyonki sab apane apane dal kii sarkaar main set ho chuke hai
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar chairman Nandu Tasgaonkar has sent his reply via email
 jawaab main likhaa he ki ve uniwarsi series dekh rahe hai magar ye nahin sochaa hoga ki ham unheen tak pahunch jaaenge
 He is sad about why Sohit did not tell the management before leaving
 aap hi sochie, ham bataa kar jate to prabandhan kya apane shikshakon ke paas le jaataa ki haa ji ab bolie ki aapako selary nahin mil rahi he
 Chairman Nandu ji has written that he is being targeted due to being a backward caste
 unka kahana he ki 'shikshakon ke saare aarope aadharahin or tathyaheen hai
 The law is doing its work in the case of PF
 ham aapako aashwast karnaa chaahate hai may 2018 se pehle adhiktam selary kaa bhugtan kar diya jayega
 Most teachers are two to three years old, so how can the right to not get salary since 2011? hamaare yahaan 50 se 60 fisadi chaatr pichhadi or ati pichhadi jati ke hai
 50 to 60 percent of our revenue comes from scholarship and freeship, so salary is related to revenue
 ham 40 fisadi rajasav ke sahare kaise santhaan chalaa sakate hai
 An engineering college of the college has been closed due to lack of students, hence their labs are closed
 ' The chairman also said that how many teachers did you talk to, do you think that talking to 10 percent teachers makes the story genuin, then should you have talked to 100 percent teachers, does it happen, if two The teachers are not getting salary, about which the chairman himself says that maximum salary will be available till May 2018
 nahin mil rahi hogi tabhi to kah rahe hai ki may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 Nevertheless, the Chairman feels that this story is wrong
 chairman sahab ke jawaab main pad kii garima kam dhamkee zyada he
 When they start saying that if you have done the muster roll check of these teachers for five years, you will find that 40 to 70 percent of these times these people are late
 jaldi chale jate hai
 We have done a series on the poor condition of fifty colleges and twenty universities
 chairman sahab pehle hai jo itane kamazor tarkon se apana bachaav kar rahe hai
 If the teacher's salary is not available, then why would anyone lie, if it is not available then give it
 baat khatm
 If the labs are not running, then run them
 ham inke mail ke saare pahalu ko kot nahin kar rahe hai varna chairman sahab kahenge ki ham jitna ghanta bolenge aap utana ghanta dikhaaiye
 Sohit Mishra stands by his report
 chairman sahab ne likhaa he ki ve mere fain hai
 i felt disappointed at such a fan and also request you not to become a fan of anyone, see if the system is getting well or not

 Gradually the situation will be fixed
 dhire-dhire ham saare logon kii selary release kar rahe hai
 It is good that the Ghaziabad administration has taken initiative in this matter and after meeting with the college chairman on November 1, an attempt will be made to resolve the problem
 har jagah kii samasya ek hi he magar sab apni apni ladaai lard rahe hai
 The students of Delhi's School of Planning and Architect have got their demands accepted
 somvaar raat paune nau baje yani prime time shuru hone se pehle chaatro ne andolan samaapti kaa elaan kar diya
 The administration has accepted most of the students' demands

 Miran Haider, a student of Jamia Millia Islamia, has been on hunger strike for 7 days

 The University is an autonomous institution
 prashasan chaahe to aaj chunaav ho saktaa he jaise jeenyu main hota he
 The VC says that the matter is stuck in the court, but the students say that this is an excuse

 MP Ali Anwar has also come in support of this Jamia movement
 auskar furnandis bhi aae hai
 Many alumni leaders of Jamia are coming
 diu se bhi ratan laal or sachin narayan yahaan bhaashan de chuke hai
 jnu's student organization and teachers' organization have also lent their support
 jamiya main 17000 chaatr padhate hai, yaheen union kii azaadi nahin to yahaan ke chaatr tamaam muddon par abhivyakti kii azaadi kii ladaai kaise ladenge
 Due to not having a student organization, students attending college are unable to raise their voice
 vaise jahaan hai vahaan bhi college main shikshakon ke nahin hone, shikshakon kii niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee, unke kam vetan ko lekar andolan nahin he
 There is silence everywhere
 jo chaatr andolan kar rahe hai wo apane jokhim par kar rahe hai baaki tamaasha dekhte hai tab tak jab tak ve khud kisi shoshan kaa shikaar nahin ho jate or kisi chaatr netaa yaa shikshak netaa kii talash main nahin lag jate
 You need the movement, not the government
 andolan nahin honge to awaz kaise uthegi

 When teachers will not encourage the students' movement, then one day their condition will also be same
 un shikshakon ke liye bhi bolne vaala koi nahin rahegaa
 It is a sign of the decline of teacher unions across the country that you no longer hear a voice through them on the worsening condition of the university because everyone has been set in the government of his party

 How can we run an institution with 40% revenue? chaatro kii sankhya nahin hone ke kaaran college kaa ek ejineering college band kar diya gaya he isliye unke lab band hai
 ' chairman ne yah bhi kaha ki aapane kitne shikshakon se baat kii, kya aapako lagata he ki 10 fisadi shikshakon se baat kar lene se story jenuin ho jaati he, to kya sau fisadi shikshakon se baat kerani chahie thi, kya aisa hota he, agar do hi shikshakon ko selary nahin mil rahi he jiske bare main khud chairman kehete hai ki adhiktam selary may 2018 tak mil jaaegi

 By the way, where there are no teachers in the college, there is no movement for rigging the appointments of teachers, their low salaries
 har taraf chuppi he
 The students who are agitating are doing it at their own risk and watch the rest of the spectacle until they themselves become victims of exploitation and start looking for any student leader or teacher leader

 bahut se kamazor log yahaan dharne par baithe mil jate the ki yahaan aate jate media kii nigaah pad jaae or baat sarkaar tak pahunch jaae
 a command snatched the voice away
 yahaan ab gamale lagaae jaaenge
 Similarly, there were demonstrations behind the Red Fort once before
 maine khud cover kiya he magar vahaan bhi pradarshan band kar diya gaya
 The park was created
 vot club par raily kii tasviir aapako veepi singh, devilal, choudhary charan singh, sharad yadav, lalu yadav, nitish kumaar kiske ghar par nahin hogi, magar vahaan to kab se yah sab band ho chukaa he
 The NGT has not given any other place but has said that the movement will go to another place like Kari Ramlila Maidan
 12 acre ke ramlila maidan main ek din ke pradarshan kaa kiraaya 50,000 rupaya he
 With this MCD earns 3 to 4 crores in a year
 wo ise muft main nahin dena chaahati he
 MCD is the institution of democracy, its representatives come from the public and they are now saying that they will not give grounds to perform free
 spes of protest, pradarshan kii jagah kaa sthaan loktantr main janata kii sansad ke samaan hota he
 Nikhil Dey of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan told that there was a 55-55 days' strike in the Statue Circle of Jaipur
 shahar ko pataa chalaa, log jude or desh ko pataa chalaa ki soochna ke adhikaar jaisaa koi adhikaar mil saktaa he, manaregaa jaisaa kanoon ban saktaa he
 Nikhil said that when the UPA wanted to make any amendment in the RTI first year, there was a protest against it at Jantar Mantar and when he won, his partner Shankar wrote a song called Jantar ki Mantar ki Jai Jai Bolo
 aaj aap jaipur ke stechu cirkil ke paas dharna pradarshan nahin kar sakate hai
 There is no place of presentation in the city
 aisa nahin he ki hamen or aap ko pradarshan kii zarurat nahin he, kaayade se har jagah sarkaar ko pradarshan karne kii jagah muft deni chahie, vahaan tak jane ke liye bas deni chahie, har tarah kii suvidha honi chahie kyonki jo pradarshan karata he wo loktantr ko sundar banaata he, jeevant banaata he
 Voting is the last thing in a democracy, the most important thing to do before that is to reach out to a place and raise voice
 isliye jamiya ke chaatro kii maang main dam he ki chaatr sangh hona chahie
 The Students' Union is also the Space of Protest
 13 aktubar ko kerala hai court ne antarim aadesh jari kiya he ki kalege ke campus main protest nahin kiya jayega, kyonki santhaan adhyayan ke liye bane hai, campus ko hadtaal or pradarshan mukt rahanaa chahie
 We spoke to the registrar of Santosh Medical College
 ve pi gupta ne kaha ki pichley saal se piji or bidies kii siten khaali chali gayi hai jisase college aarthik chunautiyon kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 Gradually the situation will be fixed
 dhire-dhire ham saare logon kii selary release kar rahe hai
 It is good that the Ghaziabad administration has taken initiative in this matter and after meeting with the college chairman on November 1, an attempt will be made to resolve the problem
 har jagah kii samasya ek hi he magar sab apni apni ladaai lard rahe hai
 The students of Delhi's School of Planning and Architect have got their demands accepted
 somvaar raat paune nau baje yani prime time shuru hone se pehle chaatro ne andolan samaapti kaa elaan kar diya
 The administration has accepted most of the students' demands
 pichley paanch dinon se yahaan ke chaatr subah shaam pradarshan kar rahe the
 Their main demands were from security to water and sanitation
 andolan kaa nateeja hi tha ki hastal or college ke campus main nayaa water cooler aa gaya
 Cleanliness was also done
 prashasan ne chaatro ko daraane ke liye parivaar waalon ko bhi patr likhaa
 In which it was said that if your children continue to perform like this, then the semester may be missed
 magar chaatr peeche nahin hate
 He slept in the classroom, did not go to his room
 ab samjhauta ho gaya he or maange maan lee gayi hai
 Miran Haider, a student of Jamia Millia Islamia, has been on hunger strike for 7 days
 unke saath kai or chaatr hadtaal par hai or din raat dharne par baith rahe hai
 Meeran Haider and his colleagues demand that when there is a teacher union, there is an employee union then why is there no student union
 jamiya ne ek ranneeti ke tahat chaatr sangh ko khatm kar diya he
 Whenever there is talk of forming a student union, there is a delay
 jab chaatro ke pratinnidhi mandal ne is cese ko lard rahe vakil se mulaakaat kii tab bataa chalaa ki 2011 ke vaais chancelar chaatr sangh nahin chaahate the
 The University is an autonomous institution
 prashasan chaahe to aaj chunaav ho saktaa he jaise jeenyu main hota he
 The VC says that the matter is stuck in the court, but the students say that this is an excuse
 shamsi mustafa or imran ahamed bhi bhukh hadtaal par baithe the jinhen aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 MP Ali Anwar has also come in support of this Jamia movement
 auskar furnandis bhi aae hai
 Many alumni leaders of Jamia are coming
 diu se bhi ratan laal or sachin narayan yahaan bhaashan de chuke hai
 jnu's student organization and teachers' organization have also lent their support
 jamiya main 17000 chaatr padhate hai, yaheen union kii azaadi nahin to yahaan ke chaatr tamaam muddon par abhivyakti kii azaadi kii ladaai kaise ladenge
 Due to not having a student organization, students attending college are unable to raise their voice
 vaise jahaan hai vahaan bhi college main shikshakon ke nahin hone, shikshakon kii niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee, unke kam vetan ko lekar andolan nahin he
 There is silence everywhere
 jo chaatr andolan kar rahe hai wo apane jokhim par kar rahe hai baaki tamaasha dekhte hai tab tak jab tak ve khud kisi shoshan kaa shikaar nahin ho jate or kisi chaatr netaa yaa shikshak netaa kii talash main nahin lag jate
 You need the movement, not the government
 andolan nahin honge to awaz kaise uthegi
 Now imagine where the protest will be at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 tippaniyan By the way, Jantar Mantar will not be available now
 neshnal green tribunel ke aadesh ke baad jantar mantar ko khaali karvaa diya gaya he
 Many demands of the general public have arisen from this small place and have reached the Parliament and Government built from here
 yahaan laudspikar se shor ho rahaa tha to band kar diya gaya
 There is noisy noise from loudspeakers in the street, but there is no place in the name of noise pollution and there is no restlessness in the society
 adaalat kaa aadesh he to police or endiemasi ne sabko bason main thuns kar yahaan se hataa diya
 The echo of the Nirbhaya movement was heard here, Anna Hazare started the movement from here, who would not have performed the BJP Congress Left here
 bahut se kamazor log yahaan dharne par baithe mil jate the ki yahaan aate jate media kii nigaah pad jaae or baat sarkaar tak pahunch jaae

 The students announced the end of the agitation before the commencement of prime time at 9
45 pm on Monday night
 prashasan ne chaatro kii zyaadaatar maange maan lee he
 For the last five days, the students here were performing in the morning and evening
 suraksha se lekar pani or safai kii vyavastha unki mukhya maange thim
 The result of the movement was that a new water cooler arrived in the hostels and college campuses
 safai bhi ho gai
 The administration also wrote letters to family members to scare students
 jisamen bataaya gaya tha ki agar aapke bachche isi tarah pradarshan karte rahe to semester miss ho saktaa he
 But the students did not back down
 classroom main sote rahe, apane kamare main nahin gaye
 The agreement has now been reached and demands have been agreed
 jamiya milia islamia ke chaatr miraan haidar 7 dinon se bhukh hadtaal par hai
 Many more students are on strike with them and are sitting on dharna day and night
 miraan haidar or unke saathiyon kii maang he ki jab yahaan shikshak union he, karmchaaree union he to chaatr sangh kyon nahin he
 Jamia has ended the student union as a strategy
 chaatr sangh banane kii jab bhi baat hoti he taalamatol hone lagati he
 When the students 'delegation met the lawyer who was fighting the case, it was revealed that the Vice Chancellor of 2011 did not want the Students' Union
 uniwarsity swytt sanstha he
 If the administration wants, elections can be held today as it happens in JNU
 visi kehete hai ki maamla court main atka he magar chaatr kehete hai ki ye bahaanaa he
 Shamsi Mustafa and Imran Ahmed were also on hunger strike who were admitted to the hospital

 jamiya ke kai purv chaatr netaa aa rahe hai
 Ratan Lal and Sachin Narayan have also given speeches here from DU
 jeenyu ke chaatr sanghathan or shikshakon ke sanghathan ne bhi apana samarthan diya he
 There are 17000 students studying in Jamia, if not the freedom of the union here, then how will the students here fight for freedom of expression on all issues
 chaatr sanghathan nahin hone se college main jane vaale chaatr awaz nahin uthaa pate
 By the way, where there are no teachers in the college, there is no movement for rigging the appointments of teachers, their low salaries
 har taraf chuppi he
 The students who are agitating are doing it at their own risk and watch the rest of the spectacle until they themselves become victims of exploitation and start looking for any student leader or teacher leader
 andolan kii zarurat aapako he, sarkaar ko nahin
 If there are no movements then how will the voice be raised
 ab sochie dilli main pradarshan jantar mantar par nahin hoga to kahaan hoga
 The comments vaise ab jantar mantar par nahin ho sakegaa
 Jantar Mantar has been evacuated following orders from the National Green Tribunal
 aam janata kii kai maangen is choti si jagah se uthi hai or yahaan se kareeb main bani sansad or sarkaar tak pahunchi hai
 The noise from the loudspeaker was stopped here
 gali mohalle main laudspikar se shor ho rahaa he koi band nahin kar rahaa he magar loktantr ke liye jo jagah he wo dhwani pradooshan ke naam par band kar di gai or samaaj main kisi prakaar kii bechaini nahin hui
 If the court orders, then the police and NDMC dumped everyone in buses and removed them from here
 nirbhaya andolan kii gunj yaheen sunai di thi, anna hazaare ne yaheen se andolan kiya, bijpi congress left kisne yahaan pradarshan nahin kiya hoga
 Many weak people used to meet sitting on dharna here so that the media would get noticed while coming here and the matter should reach the government
 ek aadesh se awaz chhin gai
 Pottery will now be planted here
 isi tarah pehle kabhi laal kila ke peeche pradarshan hote the
 i myself have covered but the performance was stopped there too

 On Vote Club, you will get the picture of the rally VP Singh, Devi Lal, Chaudhary Charan Singh, Sharad Yadav, Lalu Yadav, Nitish Kumar, whose house will not be there, but it has been closed since then
 engiti ne koi duusari jagah nahin di he magar kaha he ki andolan kaari ramlila maidan jaisi duusari jagah jaaenge
 The one-day performance in a 12-acre Ramlila ground is Rs 50,000

 She does not want to give it away for free
 loktantr kii sanstha he emsidi, iske pratinidhi janata se chunakar aate hai, wo ab kah rahe hai ki free main pradarshan karne ke liye maidan nahin denge

 Today you cannot perform a sit-down near the Statue Circle in Jaipur
 shahar main pradshan kii jagah nahin he
 It is not that we and you do not need to perform, as always the government should give free space to perform everywhere, just to go to that place, there should be every kind of facility because the one who performs democracy Beautifies, makes it lively
 vot dena loktantr main sabase aakhri kaam he, usase pehle jo sabase zaruri kaam he, lagaataar kisi jagah par pahunch kar awaz uthaanaa
 Hence the demand of Jamia students that there should be a student union
 chaatr sangh bhi spes aaf protest he
 On October 13, the Kerala High Court issued an interim order that the campus of the college not be protected, as the institutes are meant for study, the campus should remain at stake and protest free

 shahar ko pataa chalaa, log jude or desh ko pataa chalaa ki soochna ke adhikaar jaisaa koi adhikaar mil saktaa he, manaregaa jaisaa kanoon ban saktaa he
 Nikhil said that when the UPA wanted to make any amendment in the RTI first year, there was a protest against it at Jantar Mantar and when he won, his partner Shankar wrote a song called Jantar ki Mantar ki Jai Jai Bolo
 aaj aap jaipur ke stechu cirkil ke paas dharna pradarshan nahin kar sakate hai
 There is no place of presentation in the city

 Voting is the last thing in a democracy, the most important thing to do before that is to reach out to a place and raise voice
 isliye jamiya ke chaatro kii maang main dam he ki chaatr sangh hona chahie
 The Students' Union is also the Space of Protest
 13 aktubar ko kerala hai court ne antarim aadesh jari kiya he ki kalege ke campus main protest nahin kiya jayega, kyonki santhaan adhyayan ke liye bane hai, campus ko hadtaal or pradarshan mukt rahanaa chahie

 "opposition to the appointment of Gajendra Chauhangendra Chauhan on the target is continuing

 It is alleged that Chauhan's ability is above others only because he is connected to the ideology of Vosangha

 With the help of technology, vicious thugs are not hurting people by lime
 pareshaani ye he ki police bhi aise maamalon main laachaar najar aati he
 The latest case is from Indirapuram area of ghaziabad
 darasal, shaatir thagon ne pehle dilli ke conot place thane ke landline number ko hack kiya or phir ek kaarobaari ko kol karke apane jhaanse main fansaa liya
 During this, the thugs cheated the businessman of about Rs 3 lakh
 hua yun ki gajiabad ke indirapuram thana kshetra kii shipra krishna vista sosayadi main chemicalakaarobaariamit agarwal parivaar ke saath rahete hai
 His factory is in Anand Vihar area
 beeti 19 sitambar kii subah kareeb saadhe 10 baje kisi anjaan shaks ne unhen 011-23747100 number se kol kiya
 This landline number is of Connaught Place police station in Delhi
 phone karne vaale ne khud ko vahaan kaa ek pulicekarmi bataate hue amit agarwal se kaha "aapke ke mobile se logon ko kabhi rangadari ke liye phone kiye ja ja rahe hai to kabhi ashleel baaten kii ja rahi hai
 Many people have complained about your mobile number in the police station after getting upset
 "ye sunakar amit hairaan rah gaye
 He told the caller that no such call had been made to anyone from his number
 or na hi kisi se aisi baaten kii gai hai
 In this regard, CDR can be seen from the mobile service provider company
 iske baad phone cat gaya
 The next day i
e
 on the morning of 20 September, Amit got a call from the Airtel company
 phone karne vaale ne bataaya ki kai police thanon main unke number ko lekar shikaayat darj karai gai hai
 Amit told the caller that no such call had been made from his number
 is par phone karne vaale ne amit agarwal ko bataaya ki unke number kii jaanch kii gai he
 It seems that someone has cloned his mobile number
 ye sab sunakar amit ko yakeen nahin ho rahaa tha ki unke saath ye sab kaise ho saktaa he
 The matter did not end here, the next day, again he received a similar call from a station in East Delhi, and the very next day a call came from the same company as well
 ab amit ko is baat yakeen ho chalaa tha ki kisi ne unke number kaa clon bana liya he
 After this again, Amit received a call from the company
 is baar customer care officer ne unhen apane jhaanse main fansaa liya
 a link was sent to Amit on email and he was asked to download an app named Dot Secure on his mobile
 amit ne unke kehane par aisa hi kiya
 After downloading it in the phone, all the messages in Amit's phone started opening in that app
 sabase badi baat ye ki 24 ghante tak na to unke mobile par koi kol ai or na hi gai
 On the night of 20 September, at around 1 o'clock, an OTP of online transactions of Rs 5 thousand came from his account, but he could not see that SMS
 usee raat shaatir thagon ne unke credit card se kareeb teen lakh rupee kaa tranjaction kar daalaa
 This information was not revealed to Amit Aggarwal by phone but from an email from American Express Bank
 tabhi unhen jaankaree hui ki kisi ne unke credit card se tranjaction kii he
 After this incident, the victim Amit Agarwal informed the Connaught Place police station in this regard on the basis of the number
 lekin vahaan ke staff ne kisi ko bhi is tarah kii koi kol karne yaa shikaayat milane kii baat se saaf inkaar kar diya
 After this, Amit requested the station staff to show him the footage of the CCTV camera located near the landline number, but the policemen of the police station also refused
 peedit amit agarwal iske baad apane bank ja pahunche
 He gave all the details of the incident to the bank and asked how his credit card information was leaked
 kaise unke saath itani badi thagi hui
 Amit alleges that a bank employee is involved in the incident
 isi vajah se shikaayat ke chaar din biit jane par bhi bank unhen sirf itnaa hi kah rahaa he ki iti team is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 According to Amit, after 4 days, the bank staff also stopped picking up his phone
 ve kol yaa email kaa jawaab bhi nahin de rahe hai
 Tired of this, the victim Amit has lodged a complaint at the Indirapuram police station
 sio indirapuram ke mutabik police gambhirtha se is maamle kii chaanbin kar rahi he
 Love is the sea of feelings
 inhen ehsaason main duubate-utaraate hue premi ek anjaani manzil kii ore badhate hai
 Smile the hard waves of life
 tufaan ke andeshe par ek-duusare ke gale lag jate hai
 Ahh! Life is so beautiful
 kisi khubasurat sapane jaisaa lagata he sabakuch
 But this is probably the difference between dreams and reality
 ek din aisa bhi aata he jab aapako ehsaas hota he ki wo aapkaa tha hi nahin jiske aap ho gaye the
 The lack of just one person fills you with sorrow around the world
 prem aisa hi hota he, lekin jindagi kisi ke liye nahin rukati he
 Someone meets you in this world, which makes you fall in love again
 yun to prem main koi tips dene kii koshish karnaa vyarth he lekin phir bhi kuch buniyadi baton kaa aap agar khyaal rakhen to virah vednaa main aap thodaa kam tapenge
 Make these four things tied, take care before making love again
 1
 The time which has passed will never come back
 kisi kii yaad main aap tadpe roe, khaanaa-pinaa chhod diya lekin ab aapke jivan main koi or aa gaya he
 Your antics will affect him too, so forget the old things completely and start a life with a new partner
 apane nae saathi ke saamne bhuulakar bhi puraani baton kaa zikr naa karen
 This hurts their mind even if they say no
 photose, videos, chats mitaakar khud ko past se puri tarah alag kar den
 Love your new partner with full dedication
 yakeen maniye aapako bahut acha lagegaa
 2
 duusari baar rishte main padane se pehle apane mizaaj ko samajhie
 Do not be hasty in choosing a partner
 agar aapako ekant main rahanaa pasand he to aise partner ko chune jo aapke personal spes ko samajhe
 If you do not like people who are intoxicated, then keep this in mind at the time of the choice of partner
 kyonki shuruyaat main to sabakuch acha lagata he lekin samay bitne ke saath-saath yahi choti chijen badi ho jaati hai
 This advertisement is getting a lot of criticism on social media
 prem main atachament samaj main aata he lekin itnaa bhi kya ki relationships toxic ho jaae
 So keep in mind that the partner is not dominating and dictates 24 hours
 sukun jaruri he
 These dangerous viruses are spreading rapidly in India
 jivan main kuch samjhaute to karne hi padate hai lekin iskaa dhyaan rakhen ki sirf aap hi samjhaute nahin kar rahe hai
 If your partner is also supportive, then you can think about taking the car of life with him

 How ISIS terrorists, who instruct women to stay in the curtain, are unmasking and cheating them
 ye kahani jaanakar aapke rongte khadey ho jaaenge
 Terrorists take hostage girls and make them their sex slaves and cross all limits of humanity
 baat na maanane par milti he dardanaak mauttishish ke thikaanon par alag-alag jagahon se pakadi gai namaaloom kitni ladkiyansexslev yani yon gulam kii tarah jeene ko majaboor hai
 Terrorists sell them, distribute each other in gifts, get the work done as they want and torture them to death if they do not listen
 kisi bhi umr kii ladki ko nahin chhodteye aatankwaadi itane jaalim hai ki ve kisi bhi umr kii ladakiyon ko nahin chhodte
 Then whether the girl is ten years old, 12 years old or 13 years old
 aisi sabhi ladakiyon ko andhere tahkhaanon main band karke rakhaa jaataa or kai-kai dinon tak khaane-pine kii chizon tak se maharoom rakhaa jaataa
 When the Yazidis were kidnapped, ISIS militants abducted the people of the Yazidi community hiding on the hills of Sinjar in August 2014
 ISIS ne in tamaam yajidiyon se islam kubul karne ko kaha, lekin jab yajidi iske liye taiyaar nahin hue to unhen agava kar liya gaya, un par julm dhaaya jane laga
 Yajidi girls made sex slaves Yajidi girls were kidnapped and ISIS executioners made them their sex slaves
 ye aatankwaadi jab chaahe, jise chaahe uthaate or uske saath manamaani karte or agar koi ladki iske liye taiyaar nahin hoti, to use goli maar dete
 a female Iraqi journalist who raped a 12-year-old girl for months, recently escaped from isis's clutches, saw such girls and tried to understand their pain
 jab in ladakiyon ne apni aap beeti sunai, to use sun kar wo hairaan rah gayi
 The most shocking of these stories was that of a 12-year-old anonymous Yazidi girl with whom the ISIS hangman raped and persecuted for months
 kuch ladkiyaan batch nikleenjism kii mandiyon main ladakiyon kii kharid-farokht karne vaale ISIS ke aatankwaadi kitne khoonkhaar hai, iskaa khulaasa shaayad hi kabhi ho paata
 Those few Yajidi girls somehow escaped their clutches and then the truth has come out
 chhattisgarh ke dhamtari jile main gangarel jalashay ke paas kudarat kii khubsuurati or van sampadaaon se haraa-bharaa gaanv kotarbhi he
 In Dhamtari, when people were urged to build toilets, 104-year-old Kunwar Bai Yadav of the village first came forward to give his support in this work
 yah unki drudh ichhashakti kaa hi kamaal he jo aaj is gaanv kaa kayakalp ho gaya he
 Kunwar Bai, who lived by living goats and selling goats, built the first toilet in the village for 22 thousand rupees
 yahi nahin, unhone baqayada ghar-ghar jaakar logon koshauchalay banane ke liye prerit kiya or gaanvvaalon ko iske phaayde samajhane main kaamyaab bhi huin
 People of this village no longer defecate in the open
 kotarbhi main lagbhag saadhe chaar sau logon kii jansankhya he
 The story of 104-year-old Kunwar Bai, who makes the village open defecation free and shows unmatched leadership potential, is inspiring
 bakriyaan charaakar jivan-yaapan karne vaala boodha sharir bhale hi jawaab de rahaa ho lekin unki jindadilii va jujharupan har kisi ke liye ek udhaaharan he
 After all, the people of Kotarbhi have declared their village open defecation free (ODF) on 15 July

 Currently, Paytm has not officially said anything about this development
 abhi yah bhi saaf nahin he ki iske liye khaas ap launch hoga yaa phir maujuuda petm ap main hi apadet ke jariye ye feechar joda jayega
 However, if this is the case then it is a big challenge for the company
 kyonki yahaan iske pratidwandiyon kii sankhya zyada he or unki pakad bharat sahit duniya bhar main kaaphi zyada he
 Union Minister Prakash Javadekar and senior Congress leader Manish Tiwari gave their views in the third session of the Aaj Tak security meeting
 is seshan ke dauraan charchaa kaa mudda tha 'shaury par siyasat' yani balakot par airforce kii karrwai ke baad is mudde par kii ja rahi siyasat
 In the program, there was a heated debate on the politics happening on the issue of Balakot strike

 Pakistan was halved and divided into two
 congress netaa ne kaha ki 1971 se 2019 tak congress rashtriya suraksha par katibaddh rahi
 But the Congress did not politicize it
 sargical strike pehali baar nahin hua
 There have been continuous strikes since 1998
 congress netaa ke aaropon kaa jawaab dete hue kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki 1971 main jab bangladesh kaa nirmaan hua tab atal ji ne tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ko durga kaha tha or saboot nahin maange the
 AAP immediately went to the polls which was to be held in 1972
 jaavdekar ne kaha, "yahi mul fark he
 We should understand this
 aap saboot puch rahe hai
 Asked for the first surgical strike
 
 
 logon ne dikhaaya ki kaise target par chhed hua tha, andar kitna bada dhamaakaa hua
 The building remained the same, but all the inside was destroyed
 sena ke parakram par gaurav karne ke bajaay saboot maanga ja rahaa he
 "during the Aaj Tak Suraksha Sabha program, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar and Congress leader Manish Tiwari, the Union Minister further said that the Lok Sabha elections will be finished in the same time as the last time they were finished
 lekin mamata ji bol rahi hai do maheene chunaav chal rahe hai bich main ek or strike karenge
 Mutants also have a limit
 dar itnaa he ki hamaara sab kuch khatm ho jayega
 The Union Minister said, "don't be afraid, if the country is strong, we will be strong
" 11 nabanr kii arthvyastha 6the number par aa gai he
 The people are going to build a new India
 ham vikaas ke aadhaar par vot maang kar rahe hai

 supreme naagarik supreme court ne samaan naagarik samhita (unifarm civil code) lagu karaane ko lekar daakhil yachika ko sunne se inkaar kar diya he
 The court said how the Supreme Court can issue an order to Parliament to implement the code

 BJP President Rajnath Singh made it clear that no matter what the strength of the new Lok Sabha is, if the NDA government is formed at the Center, only Narendra Modi will become the Prime Minister
 chartered vimaan par pitiai ko die gaye saakshaatkaar main rajnath ne kaha, kisi bhi paristhiti main modi endie sarkaar main pradhanmantri banenge
 The BJP president's statement came in response to a question in which he was asked what would be the party's stand if the NDA lagged behind the majority and new allies insisted on a leader other than Modi
 rajnath ne kaha, desh keval kanoon ke aadhaar par hi nahin, balki aise netaa se chalata he, jinka naitik bal hota he
 Only the person who is projected as the prime ministerial candidate or the chief ministerial candidate has the moral force
 unhone modi ke 'gol topi' (scal cap) pahanane se inkaar karne se jude vishay ko 'gaiyr jaruri vivaad' bataakar khaarij kar diya
 Rajnath said, this is an attempt to make unnecessary topic unnecessarily highlighted by political opponents
 main dhoti-kurta pahentaa hum, vah (modi) kurta-pyjama pahante hai, aap shart pant pahante hai
 Is this an issue? They (rival) want to communalize the country
 unhone bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar dwaara kisi bhi vishesh samudaay se vot maangane kii apil karne se inkaar karne ke bayaan kaa samarthan kiya
 The BJP president said, "no caste, religion or community should be appealed to vote in any particular form
" prayek vyakti ko apane matadhikaar kaa upyog karne kii swatantraaa he or yah swatantra rup se hona chahie
 We appeal to all sections of society without any discrimination
 musalamaanon kii chintaaon ke bare main ek sawaal ke jawaab main singh ne kaha, ham dhire-dhire ashankaon ko dur kar rahe hai
 
 
 This fear will be removed through dialogue
 yah puche jane par ki kya modi muslim netaaon ke saath baatcheet karenge, rajnath ne keval itnaa kaha, baatcheet chalati rahati he
 Modiji also talks to him
 aapane dekha hoga ki musalmaan ab modi kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 He claimed that community people (muslims) now feel more secure in Gujarat and their per capita income has outperformed other areas in the country
 rajnath ne kaha, dhire-dhire musalamaanon tak yah sandesh pahunch rahaa he ki yah congress or anya tathakthith dharmanirpeksh dalon kaa suniyojit dushprachaar tha
 They will continue to draw closer to Modi and BJP and the confusion of fear will end
 yah puche jane par ki kya modi ko saal 2002 ke dangon par maafee maangana chahie, rajnath ne sawaal kiya, adhikansh dange congress ke shasankaal main hue
 Did they apologize? When asked whether the Congress should apologize first, after this Modi will apologize, he said, i am not saying that
 agar modi ne koi galati kii hoti, agar unhone danga rokane ke liye prayaas nahin kiya hota, tab vah maafee maang sakate the
 Rajnath said, but as Chief Minister, he tried his utmost to stop the riots, tried his best
 unhone kabhi bhi jaanch ko baadhit karne kaa prayaas nahin kiya
 Then why is there still an apology? This is Congress's revengeful politics
 modi ko sabase adhik pareshaan kiye jane vaala raajnneetik bataate hue rajnath ne kaha ki congress modi par nishaanaa saadh rahi he, kyonki vah unki lokapriyata se hataash he
 Rajnath Singh is addressing an average of three to four rallies per day
 unase poocha gaya tha ki kya modi adhik sweekaarya hote, agar 2002 ke dange nahin hue hote
 He said, Modi's acceptance is still there and it is increasing
 kisi bhi jati yaa dharm se koi bhi unase naakhush nahin he
 People understand that the Congress has always played the communal card

 trump kashmir masale par madhyasthata kii baat karte aae hai, lekin apni baat se palatate hue bhi aae hai
 In such a situation, if the two leaders meet today, then this issue is discussed or not, and if it happens then what will be the conversation will be watched

 Before this, both have also talked on the phone, in such a situation, it will have to be seen that when the two leaders are face to face, what is the decision and what kind of attitude is there

 Anita Bose Foff, the only child of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, is an economist in Augsburg, Germany
 unhone bharat sarkaar dwaara netaji se judi filon ko saarvajanik karne ke mudde par sandip unnithan se baatcheet kii
 He also pointed to differences between the Bose family over his father's last moments
 unhone is baat ko nirnaayak rup se pusht karne ke liye diene test karaane kii bhi maang kii he ki japan main rankoji mandir main rakhi asthiyaan netaji kii hai, or kaha he ki vivaad ko khatm karne ke liye asthiyon ko bharat le aana chahie
 Q: How satisfied are you with making the files related to Netaji public ?: Many historians and academicians have been demanding that these documents be made public for years, so it was better to do this
 ab unamem se kuch filon ko dekhne ke baad, mujhe yah samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki aakhir kyon kuch khaas filon ko gopneey banaakar rakhaa gaya tha
 Q: Will making the files public will end the dispute about your father's death ?: It will not end the dispute because you bring any evidence and put it in front, but some people will not believe them
 sabhi uplabdh sakshya is tathy kii ore ishaara karte hai ki mere pita vimaan durghatana ke baad kuch hi ghante tak jivit rahe
 i think no dramatic information is going to come out of the files which are yet to be made public
 lekin phir bhi dekhte hai ki ab or kya rahasy saamne aate hai
 Q: What about the controversy over your father's ashes in Japan? A: i personally feel that his DNA should be tested
 aajkal diene praudyogiki itani unnat ho gai he ki yah bataanaa mumkin he ki ve asthiyaan kiski hai
 At least for the logical people, this will put a stop to this issue and they will accept it (that these bones belong to Netaji), especially my family
 mandir ke pujari bharat or japan, donon sarkaron kii ijaajat ke bina iske liye rajamand nahin honge
 The DNA test was also said by Justice Mukherjee Commission
 or phir, agar ve asthiyaan netaji kii nahin hai, to bhi isse yah baat to siddh nahin ho jaati ki vimaan haadasa hua hi nahin tha
 Q: Many researchers say that Netaji was becoming a monk in India? A: i do not believe in this nonsense about Gumnami Baba
 agar mere pita apane parivaar ke sadasyon ke sampark main nahin the to phir ve bharat aae hi kyon honge? justise mukherjee kamishan ne bhi yahi nishkarsh nikaala tha ki gumnami baba netaji nahin the
 Q: Are there any questions, whose answers you have not yet received? A: Yes, there are some things that i am very interested in knowing

 37 main se do, sandip bhaati or niraj kumaar singhl, usee kamare (number 21) main rahete hai, jahaan olympic padak vijeta vijender singh 8 saal tak rahe
 What does the villager think about Vijender, who has won the silver medal in the Junior World Championship, while Neeraj has been a two-time junior national champion
 donon samet yahaan training le rahe tamaam mukkebaajon ke liye vijender ek iken hai
 But the recent tragedy on Vijender Singh has made this generation of boxing unhappy

 The allegations against Vijender are false
 lekin duniya ko saboot chahien or yadi vijender singh ne vaaki kuch nahin kiya he to unhen sabit karnaa chahie
 His friend Manish Bhardwaj, who was in the same room with Vijender Singh, said that Vijender has said that he is ready to undergo any test of NADA or WADA
 yadi vijender ne kuch galat kiya hota to ve yah baat nahin kehete
 Manish has also been a national level boxer
 manish kehete hai ki ve khud ko nirdosh sabit kar hi denge
 Manish Bhardwaj also says that i have shared a room with Vijender and i have never seen him getting intoxicated
 lekin phir bhi unhen sabhi test se guzarana chahie, taaki khel kii image ko koi dhakka na lage
 Brijbhan, the administrator (admin) of this train center, has seen Vijender from the beginning till now how he was a simple star
 ve 2007 se is centre ke admin or restling coach bhi hai
 He says that the news related to Vijender was a big shock to the people of the center
 ham ab bhi yah maanate hai ki vijender kaa link kisi drugs mafia se nahin ho saktaa
 Everyone is looking forward to Vijender Singh's future
 centre ke log maanate hai ki is ghatnakram se boxing kii image par panch jarur laga he
 BJP has won a tremendous victory in UP
 jeet se party ke hausale bhi saatven aasmaan par hai
 The next match is of Delhi MCD election
 emsidi chunaav jeetna party ke liye tedi kheer he, kyonki dilli main party kii haalat acchhee nahin he or do saal pehle hi vidhansabha main chunaav main aam aadmi party ke haathon karaari haar mili thi
 That is why the BJP is preparing to run a bet that the MCD, which has been in power for the last ten years, should not slip from its hand
 bijepi kaa MCD formuladilli bijepi ke formule ke mutabik party ekadam nae or yuva chehron ke saath maidan main utregi
 Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari has also got the green signal from the high command for this plan
 manoj tiwari ke mutabik party achche ummidavaaron kaa chunaav karegi, jo na sirf jamini str par kaam karne vaale hon, balki unki ground report bhi thik ho
 According to Tiwari, this decision has been taken to bring new energy and enthusiasm in the functioning of MCD with new faces
 haalanki sutron ke mutabik is faisle ke peeche asal vajah kuch or he
 The first is that the BJP has been in the MCD for the last ten years
 satta virdohi lahar ko kamjor karne ke liye bijepi apane puraane parshadon ko maidan se hataanaa chaahati he
 So that with new faces, the party can go public with new plans and new promises
 doosraa bada kaaran bhi isi se judaa he or wo ye ki dilli sarkaar main kabiz aam aadmi party emsidi membijapi ke naakaaraapan or bhrashtacharco mudda banaati rahi he
 In MCD elections too, his focus is going to be on this
 taaki anti inkambency ke mudde ko bhunaaya ja sake
 In such a situation, the BJP will cut the tickets of the old councilors, then it will get a chance to woo voters through new and young faces
 iske saath hi sutron ke mutabik party maujuuda parshadon ke kareebi rishtedaaron ko bhi tikat die jane par pabandi laga sakati he
 MCD elections will be held in April only in Delhi and now elections can be announced anytime
 aise main bijepi ke liye maujuuda parshadon ko puri tarah se badalane kaa faisla na sirf siyaasi taur par bada kadam he, balki jokhim bharaa bhi ho saktaa he
 This is because if BJP implements this formula, then the path of many veteran leaders who have been active in MCD politics for years will be closed
 jaahir he party ne faisla kar to liya he, lekin isse bhitari ghamaasan kaa bhi khatra he

 — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)january 23, 2019 Team Anna said on Friday that the government composed the drama in the Rajya Sabha as it did not intend to create a strong anti-corruption institution
 team anna ke sadsy arvind kejariwal ne kaha, ‘rajyasabha main jis tarah matdaan se bachaa gaya usase sabit hota he ki sarkaar ek ke baad ek dhokhaa kar rahi he
 He says that he wants to introduce a strong Lokpal Bill, but he does not have such intention
 ’ anna hajaare ke samarthakon kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar agar teen sanshodhano ko maan leti to vah vidheyak paarit kara sakati thi
 These three amendments are - CBI independence, the process of selection and removal and the separation of Lokayukta
 kejariwal ne kaha ki sadan main pesh kiya gaya vidheyak na sirf kamjor tha balki ‘khatarnaak’ bhi tha, kyonki isamen lokapal puri tarah sarkaar ke niyantran main tha
 Kejriwal said, 'this could have been the beginning of a strong Lokpal
 ’ vahiin team ke ek anya sadsy prashanth bhushan ne kaha, ‘ab ladaai loktantr ko bachaane ke liye hogi
 "on the other hand, Kejriwal said," Television channels had told in the news of the day that RJD members would create hurdles and pull the proceedings till late night so that the bill could not be discussed
 rajyasabha main jo hua uski patakatha sadan ke baahar hi likh lee gai thi
 Some people acted accordingly
 
 This was a clear case of match fixing in Parliament
 ’ Prashant said, "people were appointed to disrupt the proceedings, remove the bill and ensure that everyone goes home without passing the bill
 ’ team ke anya sadsy shanti bhushan ne kaha ki teen sanshondhanon par vipaksh ekamat ho chukaa tha
 He said that the Prime Minister was also present during the 'murder' of democracy inside the House

 rashtriya takneekee anusandhan sanghathan (antiaro) ke ricard main, yaa kahin or se in aaropon kii pushti nahin hui he
 During Chidambaram's statement, the entire opposition, including SP and RJD members, who were supporting the government from outside, continued to shout slogans against the alleged phone tapping and demanded a statement from the Prime Minister instead of the Home Minister
 outluk patrika main prakashit report main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar, rakanpa netaa sharad pavaar, makapa netaa prakaash karaat tathaa congress mahasachiv digvijay singh sahit kuch netaaon ke phone tap kiye jane ke aarope lagaae gaye hai
 Chidambaram said that the government has seen the allegations leveled against NTRO in the report published in this May 3 issue of the magazine
 unhone kaha, ‘patrika main lagaae gaye aaropon kii or jaanch kii ja rahi he
 If any evidence is found then the case will be thoroughly investigated by the appropriate agencies
 ’unhone kaha, ‘hamaari khufia agenciyaan kanoon ke bheetar kaam karti hai
 He is fully accountable to the government

 Such surveillance is required at many levels to control and monitor it, if necessary, for fighting crime, for national security or for our counter-terrorism efforts
 ’grih mantri ne kaha, ‘samprag kii purvavarti or vartmaan, donon sarkaron ne is bare main desh ke kanoonon kaa sammaan kiya he
 We are committed to protecting the rights of every Indian citizen, including their right to privacy
 bhartiya samvidhan main nagarikon ke vyaktigat adhikaron kaa ham sammaan karenge
 In the meantime, the opposition members were adamant on demanding a statement from the Prime Minister instead of the Home Minister, and members of several parties came to the seat and raised slogans about it
 sadan ke netaa pranav mukherjee ne kaha ki unhone bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani kii is bare main maang kaa sammaan karte hue pradhanmantri se sampark kiya he or vah is sambandh main sadan main dopaher baad saadhe teen baje bayaan dene ko taiyaar hai
 He said that since the Prime Minister is still in talks with the President of Afghanistan and after the midday meal with him, he is ready to come to the House and give a statement about it
 mukherjee ne kaha ki vipakshi sadsy agar is par sahamat hai to thik he anyathaa grih mantri is sambandh main bayaan dene ko taiyaar hai
 Opposition members including RJD and SP did not agree on this and did not stop the chaos, Speaker Meira Kumar adjourned the house till 2 minutes after Chidambaram's statement

 rantunga ne kaha, ‘is baat ko nazarandaaj kar diya gaya ki jayalalita or karunanidhi donon srilankai khilaadiyon ko tamilnadu main khilne se isliye rokna chaahate hai kyonki ve srilanka par maanav adhikaron ke hanan kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 Therefore, playing in other (indian) states, except Tamil Nadu, is in support of allegations of human rights violations against our country
 ’unhone kaha, ‘khilaadiyon ko bhi is baat se waakif hona hoga ki duniya kahegi ki srilankai khilaadiyon ne anjaane main maanav adhikaar hanan ke aaropon kaa samarthan kiya
 Ranatunga accused both Tamil Nadu leaders of doing politics with sports
 unhone kaha, ‘ve tamilnadu main chunaavon ke samay ko chhodkar kabhi uttar or purv (srilanka) ke tamilon ke kalyaan ke liye chintit nahin rahe
 He also criticized the attitude of the IPL organizers on the issue

 Earlier Ranatunga strongly criticized the decision of the IPL Governing Council to keep Sri Lankan cricketers away from the matches in Chennai and asked the players of their country to withdraw from the T20 tournament starting April 3
 rantunga ne kaha, ‘jahaan tak cricketron kaa sawaal he to main samajhataa hum ki yadi ve dakshin bharat (chennai) main nahin khel sakate he to unhen duusare hisson main bhi nahin khelnaa chahie
 My personal opinion is that if players are not welcome in one part of India, they should not be part of the IPL
 ’unhone kaha, ‘dakshin bhartiya raajnneetijna yuddh aparaadhon kaa bahaanaa bana rahe hai
 Players should think about this and think about the country and withdraw from the entire Indian Premier League

 '' a Delhi court has said that to ensure the credibility of a medium such as check, it is necessary to give such punishment in cases of check bounce, which set precedent

 This person was also directed by a magistrate court to give a compensation of Rs 20 lakh to the complainant in case of check bounce

 unhone nichali adaalat ke saath sahmati jataai ki vah check bouns hone kii ghatnaon ke khilaaf misaal kaayam karne ke liye majboot upaay karnaa chaahate hai
 The judge said, "to ensure the credibility of mediums like checks, which are part of a person's daily life in some type of transaction, Misali should be punished

 Nearly seven years have gone bad, so the compensation amount is reasonable
 atirikt satr nyaayadhish pulastya parmachal ne magistrate ke aadesh ke khilaaf is vyakti kii ore se daayar apil ko khaarij kar diya
 He agreed with the lower court that he wanted to take strong measures to set precedent against incidents of check bounce

 The court upheld the sentence of imprisonment and the amount of compensation, saying that the compensation of 20 lakhs was double the amount for which the check was issued on 30 September 2010

 Premium charges apply !! hindustan main 17veen loksabhaa ke chunaav chal rahe hai
 This time Lok Sabha elections are being held in 7 phases
 ab tak 6 charnon ke matdaan ho chuke hai
 Voting on 59 seats in 8 states in the last and 7th phase will be held on May 19
 iske baad 23 may ko counting hogi or pataa chalegaa ki wo 543 log koun hai, jinhen janata ne sansad bhejne ke liye chunaa he
 At the same time, before this, speculation has started that who will win? Which party will have how many seats? So much that the people of the political parties want to know that Sehra will adorn her forehead
 Before the counting of votes, the actual results cannot be told, but how to calm the curiosity of the people, a way has been found and that is the way of exit poll
 19 may ko hi tivi channelon par shaam 6 baje ke baad agsit pole aane lagenge
 Even before this, people are making political speculations about the victory and defeat of parties on social media
 koi opinial pole, koi chunavi survey to koi personal opinian de rahaa he, lekin sabase sateek akalan agsit pole kaa hota he
 In this, it is known which party is blowing in favor
 koun-sa dal is chunaav main baaji maaregaa? aaie aapako bataate hai ki aakhir agsit pole hote kya hai? kaise nikalate hai agsit pole ke aankade?pehle samajhie chunavi survey kaa ganitegsit pole se pehle samajhie chunavi survey ko

 These surveys are of different types and the basis is also different
 isi main shaamil hote hai agsit or opinian pole
 What are exit polls? Exit polls are always shown only after completion of voting
 lekin agar chunaav ek charan se zyada ho to jo aakhri charan hota he, us din matdaan puraa hone ke baad iske nattejey dikhaae jate hai
 But before that the data is collected on every day of voting
 masalan, maujuuda loksabhaa chunaav saat charnon main ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, data was collected after every phase of voting for exit poll
 voting ke din jab matadaata vot daalkar nikal rahaa hota he, tab usase poocha jaataa he ki usne kise vot diya
 Extensive results are derived from the survey conducted on this basis
 ise hi agsit pole kehete hai
 TV channels usually show exit polls on the last day of voting
 jaise maan lijie ki 19 may ko 7wein charan kii voting khatm ho jaaegi or shaam 7 baje aap tivi par jo chunavi survey dekhenge wo agsit pole hi hoga
 This will include surveys conducted after voting for each phase
 isamen yah dikhaaya jaataa he ki koun-se dal ke pratyaashee jeet rahe hai or kis dal ke pratyaashee haar rahe hai
 Who started the exit poll for the first time? The credit for starting the exit poll goes to Marcel von Damm, a Netherlands sociologist and former politician
 unhone 15 farvari, 1967 ko pehali iskaa istemaal kiya tha
 His assessment was accurate in the election held in the Netherlands
 jabaki bharat main isaki shuruyaat kaa shrey indian institute of public opinian ke mukhiya erik di costa ko jaataa he
