 It is very difficult to make people laugh

 reatin2 stardiarectorabhishek choubekalakaarashahid kapur, aalia bhatta or dilajit dosanjh'udata punjab'ko lekar jis tarah vivaadon kaa daur rahaa or jaise film relies hone se pehle hangaamaa ho rahaa tha, or phir film kasensorpriein jis tarah se online li kar diya gaya, vah bhartiya cinema kaa kaaphi dukhad adhyay he
 This kind of atmosphere cannot be called good for any film or creative work
 film kii baat karen to punjab ke asal halaat dikhaane vaali yah film kamjor script or treetment kii vajah se ausat hi nikali
 Seeing the film, it was felt that director Abhishek Chaubey should have worked a bit more on this subject
 unhone puure vishay kii gambhirtha ko bahut hi halkepan se pesh karne kii koshish kii he, shaayad unhone yah film ke maahaul ko halkaa banane ke liye kiya ho lekin yah baat chubhti he
 Anurag Kashyap has chosen the theme of the film correctly but he has not been able to get into the depths of it, and his focus became more focused on how people are abused or the pop star gets intoxicated more than the drunkenness in Punjab
 phir film kii shuruyaat main vaidhanik baaten likhi aati hai vah star wars movie ke style se copy hai, or yah baat bahut hi chubhti he
 The funny thing is that the villagers of the village are seen for the first time listening to the English news in a Hindi film
 punjab main nashe ke kaarobaar ko lekar film main gaharaai kaa gaharaa abhaav he
 Diljit Dosanjh is fine in acting
 shahid kapoorpuri film main samaj hi nahin pate hai ki vah kya kar rahe hai or yah unke kariyar ke liye ek or bada jhatka he
 Why Kareena Kapoor Khan chose this role, she would know very well
 film main jisane sabase zyada dhyaan khinchaa vah aalia bhatta hi hai
 Before the release of the film, there were many doubts about his appearance as a Bihari laborer
 lekin unhone apane shandaar abhinay se dil jeet liya
 His dialogue delivery and character were both life-threatening
 agar anuraag ne film ko unke kairactor ke ird-gird buna hota to shaayad film kuch or hi hoti
 Aliake is always thinking about the character what must be happening to him
 agar film ko thodaa tite rakhaa jaataa to shaayad film dhardaar hoti
 Tommy Singh's character and Diljit's life should have been sorted a bit
 film ko relies se pehle li kar diya gaya tha, aise main kamjor kahani film ke liye doosraa bada aghat siddh ho sakati he
 Perhaps Anurag needs to focus on the story of his films more than controversies

 bihar ke jila saharsa ke bangaanv main ho rahaa ye bhajan kirthan kisi puja paath kaa nahin balki ek dharmasabha kaa hissaa he
 In fact, it would be better to call it tradition than religion
 kyonki is dharmasabha kaa itihaas koi 10, 20, 50 saal kaa nahin balki 125 saalon se bhi zyada kaa he
 For so many years, this Synod has been happening here every Sunday without any break

 "in a state where the difference between reality and curtain has always been blurred, Sasikala's journey from the owner of a video cassette rental shop to the halt of power coming out of Fort St

 teen dashak se zyada vakt tak ve eiediemke kii supremeo jayalalita kii parchaai banakar unka khyaal rakhti raheen or unhone kabhi kisi rajnatik pad main koi dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 However, just 60 days after Jayalalithaa's demise, she suddenly came to light and effortlessly disguised him and assumed the post of General Secretary of the party on 20 December and was then elected the Legislature Party leader on 5 February
 donon padon par ek saath kabiz rahanaa darasal mjiaar or jayalalita kii hi parampara ko aage badhanaa tha
 Addressing party mlas in the green sari and blouse identified by Jayalalithaa, the emotional Sasikala said, "I have accepted the post of general secretary of the party due to the persistence of our leaders
 main aisa karne ke mood main nahin thi
 Now, in response to your feelings that the same person should be in the post of General Secretary and Chief Minister, i accept your demand

" kuch rajnatik vishleshkon kaa daawa he ki 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se kaaphi pehle shashikala or tamilnadu sarkaar main afasar rahe unke pati em
 Natarajan had guessed that the days of Jayalalithaa are now few, only then did she plan to take over the chief minister's chair
 us vakt tak kidney kii beemaari or niyamit dialysis ke chalate jayalalita kaa madhumeh kaaphi bad chukaa tha
 The only difference is that Sasikala does not have a sharp mind like Jayalalithaa who can maintain the magic of her charismatic personality along with the solidarity in the party
 shashikala agar kaamyaab raheen, to isaki ek vajah unki maamuli prishthbhumi or tej ubhaar hoga
 Today she has crossed the age of sixty years and has come a long way after marrying Natarajan in 1973, leaving Tiruturaipundi town, which was once part of Thanjavur district
 natarajan ne unhen 1980 ke dashak main chennai ke milapur main video casette kiraye par dene or recording karne vaali ek dukaan vinod video vijan kholane ke liye prerit kiya tha
 At that time, the trend of making video films of political events had started

 Sasikala made such a positive impact on Jayalalithaa that the friendship of the two began to flourish
 mjiaar ke guzarane ke ekaadh saal baad shashikala or natarajan, donon hi jayalalita ke poes garden sthit awaas kaa hissaa ban gaye
 Soon, due to allegations of political interference of this couple, they removed Natarajan from there but Sasikala remained there
 jayalalita jab pehali baar 1991 main mukhyamantri baniin, uske baad aarope lage ki shashikala or unke rishtedaar samvidhanetar bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 Despite this, he kept Sasikala with her
 itnaa hi nahin, jayalalita ne shashikala ke bhattije ve
 N
 sudhakaran kii shaadi kaa bhi aayojan kiya
 The interdependence of the two grew stronger and when Sasikala was arrested in a case of Phera violation, Jayalalithaa said that she was being "punished for bafadari"
 in sabase vichlit hue bagaiyr shashikala ne unheen dinon se apana ek vistaarit or bharosemand kunba viksit karnaa shuru kiya jise mannargudi samooh kaha jaataa he
 It retained a tremendous grip on the AIADMK behind Jayalalithaa
 shashikala ko keval jayalalita kii kaaryastylee aati he or kuch maamalon main to ve uski janak bhi rahi hai
 Now she is going to create a new Chief Minister's office where she will keep those who have the trust of her clan and husband

 3 to 4 terrorists had come to kidnap Javed in a Santro car - Javed, who went to the market to take medicines, took him at gunpoint - When Javed was being kidnapped, some friends were also with him - firing in the air and terrorists
 First created an atmosphere of panic - and then kidnapped Javed - Javed's body has claimed responsibility for the murder of Milihizbul Mujahideen Nejaved in the neighboring district of Kulgam

 This time, with the election coming close, the third front has come into existence once again with the slogan of non BJP and non Congress in Uttarakhand

 For communist parties as well as other smaller parties, this election is only a means of making their agenda public, but the question is about Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD)
 alag rajya ko lekar varshon tak sangharsh karne vaale is dal kii sthiti yah thi ki rajya gathan ke baad pehali baar 2002 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main party ko keval chaar siten hi mil pain
 Now the situation is more difficult because this time the party has split into two parts just before the elections
 eukedy ko ab tak apane chunaav chinh or jhde tak kaa pataa nahin he
 After the split of the party, both factions have staked their claim on this and now the matter is at the threshold of the Election Commission
 party kaa ek gut cabinet mantri divakar bhatta ke netritv main bhaajapa ke saath khadaa he, jabaki doosraa sarkaar ko aade haathon le rahaa he
 Indeed, the tradition of the movement started by the UKD, after the formation of the state, it could not sustain it
 jahaan party ko jal, jangal, jameen, rojgaar, palaayan or pahaad main udyogikaran jaise muddon par dhyaan kendrit karnaa tha, vahiin party isse hatakar sarkaar kii ganesh parikrama main lag gai
 The Congress government formed in 2002 after the formation of the state did not need any support, but in 2007, as soon as the BJP invited UKD to come together, it joined the government
 par yah faisla eukedy kii bhul sabit hua
 Although the UKD supported the BJP government based on 9 issues, the BJP continued to entertain the UKD over these for five years
 haalanki is dauraan bhaajapa do baar khanduri ko, ek baar nishank ko mukhyamantri bana chuki he, lekin eukedy ke saath hue mudda aadhaarit samajhaite kaa kuch nahin hua
 Even the BJP did not take any decision on important issues like industrialization in the mountains, stopping migration and non-capital
 itnaa jarur hua ki bhaajapa ne sarkaar main cabinet mantri kaa ek pad eukedy ko de diya or aakhirkaar eukedy cote ke is mantri pad se rajya kii janata kaa kuch bhala to ho nahin paaya, lekin party kaa vibhaajan jarur ho gaya
 Ever since the formation of the BJP government in 2002, a large section of the conflicts in the UKD continued to believe that it should not lend any support to the BJP
 lekin doosraa dhada rajya main rajnatik sthirataa kii baat kahkar samarthan dene ke liye party ko raji karne main safal rahaa
 In 2010, Dr
 narayan jantavaal ke sthaan par jaise hi eukedy adhyaksh pad par trivendra singh pavaar kii tajposhi hui, unhone samarthan vaapasi kaa elaan kar diya
 But a section of the party led by Cabinet Minister Diwakar Bhatt turned against this decision
 divakar nahin maane or party ke duusare dhade ne sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya
 There are three UKD mlas in the House, of which Omgopal Rawat also went to the government as well as the minister
 samarthan waapas lene vaale pavaar gut ke paale main keval ek hi vidhayak pushpesh treepathi aae
 UKD formally announced the withdrawal of support from the government on 27 December 2010
 tab se aaj tak yah party do dhadon main banty hui he
 The entire battle from its election symbol to recognition is going on in the Election Commission
 eukedy ke kendriya adhyaksh pavaar kaa kahana he ki bhaajapa-congress ko rokane ke liye tisare morche kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 Even if it does not take shape, the party will contest all 70 seats
 party main eka ke sawaal par pavaar ne kaha, ''nishkasit vyaktiyon se eka kaa sawaal hi nahin he
 He is not a faction, but the expelled people of the party
 yah baat chunaav ayog ne bhi maan lee he
 Only we were called in the recent meeting
 jald hi kendriya chunaav ayog kaa faisla bhia jayega
 "there are increasing troubles for the other party faction
" ek to mukhya dhade ne kisi tarah ke eka se manaa kiya he
 On the other hand, BJP is not in the mood to give up seats for these two rebel mlas of UKD
 bhaajapa pradesh adhyaksh bishan singh chuphaal ne kaha ki is maamle main koi vichaar nahin hua he
 The Election Steering Committee will decide in this regard
 jabaki party pravaktaa satish lakheda kehete hai ki is maamle main jaldi hi faisla ho jayega

 All cricket fans are aware of the fact that Sachin Tendulkar, who had almost all the records of scoring runs, started his international cricket career against Pakistan
 lekin vakaar unuus or wasim akram jaise khatarnaak tej gendbaajon se saji pakistani team ke khilaaf 1989 main test cricket main kadam rakhane par ve itane dare hue the ki unhen is str par khilne kii apni kaabiliyat par shaq hone laga tha
 In his recently released autobiography 'playing It My Way', Tendulkar revealed how tough his first Test innings had been for him
 unhone apni kitaab main likhaa, ‘vah agnipariksha se kam nahin tha
 In my first innings in Test cricket, i was in front of Wasim and Waqar and i started doubting my ability to bat and i started to question whether i would ever be able to play well at international level
 ’unhone aage likhaa, ‘meraa padaarpan isliye or bhi khaas ho gaya tha, kyonki ham pakistan ke khilaaf pakistan main khel rahe the or unke paas imran khan, wasim akram, vakaar unuus, aaqib javed jaise tej gendbaaj the jabaki mushtak ahamed or abdul kaadir jaise spinner bhi the
 On his first tour, Tendulkar told how the aggressive Wasim had him in Test cricket
 unhone kaha, ‘main over kii teesri gend par unke saamne strike par tha or vah gend unhone bounsar phenki
 Because of understanding Wasim's bowling, i knew that the next ball would be the yorker and i was mentally prepared for him
 ’ tendulkar ne likhaa, wasim ne phir bounsar phenkaa jo maine chhod diya
 i was waiting for the yorker, but the fifth and sixth balls were also bouncers
 us over ke aakhir main maine khud se kaha, test cricket main tumhaara swaagat he
 Aware of the pressures of international cricket against arch-rivals Pakistan, Tendulkar told how he had bled on Waqar's ball in the fourth Test in Sialkot
 unhone kaha, maine apana pehla ran banaaya tha, jab vakaar ne ek short gend phenki jo mujhe laga tha ki thodhi tak jaaegi
 i could not detect the bounce of the ball and it rose six inches higher and hit the flap of my helmet
 meri naak par vah gend ja lagi
 Tendulkar said, i could not see anything and my head became heavy
 uske baad gend slip main gai or main dekhne laga ki gend kahaan gai he
 At the same time i saw blood on my shirt
 unhone kaha, main us jatke se ubarne kii koshish kar rahaa tha ki javed miyandad kii tippaniyon par hairaan rah gaya
 He was saying 'hey you have to go to the hospital now, your nose is broken
 ’ ddeerghaaon main ek binar par likhaa tha, bachche ghar jaakar doodh pike aa jisase meri bechaini or bad gai
 Tendulkar mentioned another incident when this 16-year-old boy was not only scared in Karachi Test but also got emotional about the india-pakistan match
 unhone kaha, antarrashtriya cricket main meraa pehla din naatakeeyata se bharaa tha or ek vaakya to kaaphi kharaab rahaa
 After lunch, a bearded man wearing a salwar kameez entered the ground and started abusing Kapil Dev for coming to Pakistan
 unhone kaha, kapil ke baad vah midof main manoj prabhakar ke paas gaya
 After abusing Prabhakar, he went to Captain Srikanth and started a scuffle
 unhone kaha, main point par fielding kar rahaa tha or main dar gaya ki aglaa number meraa hoga or main dressing room kii taraf bhaagane ko taiyaar tha
 The reality is that more than a cricket match was being played between the two countries

 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav se pehle jab mulaayam or akhilesh ke bich khatpat hui tab se ye sawaal kai baar uth chukaa he
 The question had come to a halt for some time after the bjp's election in the election
 lekin ab ek baar phir se samaajawaadee party ke bheetar sargarmi bad gayi he or ye kaha ja rahaa he ki navaratri ke dauraan mulaayam singh apane bhai shivpal yadav ke saath nai party yaa nae morcha kaa elaan kar sakate hai
 Two days ago Shivpal Yadav said in Kanauj that the insult of Mulayam Singh Yadav cannot be tolerated anymore
 darasal, shivpal yadav party or parivaar ke is jhagade ke baad raajnneeti main ekadam darkinar ho gaye hai or samaajawaadee party main vah sammaan vaapasi kii raah talash rahe the
 But according to sources, Akhilesh Yadav and his supporters are not willing to trust him in any way
 isliye ab wo mulaayam ko aage karkekoi nayaa daanvkhelanaa chaahate hai
 Earlier, activity in the Samajwadi Party has increased
 buudhvaar 20 sitambar ko samaajaparty ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav lakhanu main press conference karenge
 On 21st, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav have called a meeting of Lohia Trust
 is trust main akhilesh yadav or ramgopal yadav bhi sadsy hai
 Whether these people join the meeting or not will be seen
 kyonki is trust main mulaayam ke kareebi logon kaa bolbalaa he
 Shivpal Yadav has already shown the way out to all the people of Akhilesh who were members in this trust
 mana ja rahaa he ki akhilesh ke bache khuche logon ko bhi mulaayam or shivpal ab trust se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa dengen
 On September 23, at the Ramabai Ambedkar Maidan in Lucknow, Akhilesh Yadav called the regional conference of the Samajwadi Party and the national convention of the Samajwadi Party in Agra on 5 October
 in baithkon ke jariye akhilesh yadav party main apni pakad ko majaboor karnaa chaahate hai or apane adhyaksh hone par ek baar phir rashtriya adhiveshan kii muhar lagaana chaahate hai
 Recently, the Samajwadi Party had increased the tenure of its national president from three years to five years
 is faisle ke upar bhi rashtriya adhiveshan main aupchaarik manjuuri lee jaaegi
 According to sources, the invitations being sent for the session are missing the picture of Mulayam Singh and he will not be seen in the posters
 matlab bilkul saaf he ki mulaayam-shivpal ke alag party yamorcha banane ke iraadon kii bhanakabhi akhilesh ko lag chuki he isliye wo mulaayam ke chitra ko jagah dene kii rasaadaaygi bhi ab nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 Meanwhile, on September 25, in Lucknow itself, Mulayam Singh Yadav has also called his press conference
 us din wo kya elaan karte hai ye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga

 In the ongoing war between ISIS, the rebel army and the Syrian president's army, people are forced to eat grass, paper cardboard and even domesticated and stray animals in many Syrian cities
 bhukh maut ban kar khadi ho gaisyria ke madaya or idaleeb shaharon ke alaava kareeb 15 ilaake aise hai, jahaan is vakt kareeb chaar lakh logon ke saamne bhukh maut ban kar khadi ho gai he
 Hunger made this city so hungry that people had to eat even their own domesticated dogs and cats to survive
 ab to puure shahar main kute or billi bhi nahin bache
 Thousands of children, eating grass and cardboard, are neither allowed to come out of the area nor should anyone come from outside
 lihaaja jinda rahane ke liye tamaam jaruri chijen jinamein khaanaa, pani davaaiyaan shaamil hai sabhi in logon se dur ho gaye
 Because of these three people ruling Syria, thousands of children of the country are keeping themselves alive by eating chagas and cardboard
 vaise bhukh se kitne mar gaye ye pataa lagane vaale bhi nahin hai
 The fight to establish the rule of the three factions is Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, whose filthy legacy is the result of ISIS
 puri duniya main yah apane hisaab se islam ke naam par apni hukumat chahta he
 Syrian President Bashar al-assad has been in the grip of the Syrian throne for years
 apni usee hukumat ko bachaane ke liye inhone syria ko grih yuddh main jhonk rakhaa he
 People of the Lebanese Hezbollah group want to establish their rule in Syria by overthrowing the Syrian President
 jinda rahane ke liye kuch bhi nahinhar gut kah rahaa he ki uski ladaai sirf virdohi sena se he, aam logon se nahin
 They also say that the siege is to weaken the enemy, so that the logistics cannot reach them and they are broken

 These are the outskirts of the Syrian city of Damascus, where rebels have occupied and thus the region is under siege and is demanding arms from the rebels
 lekin vidrohi bhi jhukne ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 Many human rights organizations and help agencies will be able to do the same on the corpses and are trying to reach them with food and drink for the Syrian people
 lekin in logon ko bhi un ilaakon main jane se roka ja rahaa he
 Now in the circumstances, if the food does not reach the people soon, then one of these organizations will definitely occupy these areas, but they will only be able to rule over the corpses

 ye ranneeti thik waisi ho sakati he, jaisi iraq main kaamyaab hui
 According to Obama, such opportunities can be achieved in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where this strategy becomes effective
 obama ne apane chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhi aisi baaten kahin thim ki taliban ke kisi hisse ko alag rakhkar dekhne kii sambhaavna talashni chahie
 Obama also referred to US campaign leader General David Petraeus in Iraq

 ) Today is the 72nd birth anniversary of Sanjay Gandhi
 unka janm 14 disambar, 1946 main hua
 Sanjay Gandhi was seen as the political successor of Indira Gandhi, but his demise completely changed the political air of the country and when Indira Gandhi was killed four years after the incident, her elder son Rajiv Gandhi was supposed to take over his legacy
 Had to step into politics
 kuch aisa tha andaaj70 ke dashak ko sanjay gandhi kii vajah se yaadgaar mana jaataa he
 The role of Emergency in India was very controversial
 haalanki, unki tejatarraar style or drudh nishchayi soch kii vajah se wo desh kii yuva pasand the
 Sanjay Gandhi was known for his simplicity and speech
 kaha jaataa he ki ve plane main bhi kolhapuri chappal pahante the, jiske liye rajeev gandhi unhen baar-baar chetavanee dete the ki sanjay udaan se pehle chappal nahin balki payalat vaale juute pahane
 However, Sanjay did not pay any heed to her advice
 immergency main bhi thi ahm bhoomikamahaj 33 saal kii umr main hi sanjay gandhi satta or siyasat kii wo dhuree ban gaye the, jahaan kehete hai ki cabinet bhi bouna pad jaataa tha
 Sanjay Gandhi became a force for Indira Gandhi and sometimes helplessness
 indira gandhi ke nirnaayak faislon main sanjay kaa dakhal tha or kaha jaataa he ki desh par immergency thopane main bhi sanjay kii badi bhoomika thi
 Kamal Nath considered Indira the 'third son', had gone for Sanjay Gandhi, wanted to keep the Emergency in jail for 35 years, Sanjay Gandhi at midnight of 25 June 1975 when the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared emergency in the country
 It was created
 apatkaal ke faisle ko bhartiya raajnneeti ke itihaas kaa sabase kaala din bataaya gaya, ye kareeb 2 saal tak rahaa
 However, during that time Sanjay Gandhi would have had an emergency in the country for about 35 years
 kaha jaataa he ki immergency lagu karne ke faisle main sanjay gandhi kaa bada prabhaav tha, us dauraan bhi jis tarah se desh main faisle lagu kiye ja rahe the vah puri tarah se sanjay ke hi niyantran main the
 According to senior journalist Kuldeep Nayyar, when he met Sanjay Gandhi after Emergency, he talked to him on this
 tabhi sanjay gandhi ne unhen bataaya tha ki vah desh main kam se kam 35 saal tak apatkaal ko lagu rakhana chaahate the, lekin maa ne chunaav karvaa die
 From Bal Charkha to Iron Lady, see in 20 pictures Indira's life brought back to Congress
 After the Emergency, the 1977 defeat gave birth to a new Sanjay Gandhi
 raajnneeti ko thenge par rakhane vaale sanjay gandhi ne raajnneeti kaa guna-bhaag sikh liya
 It is said that after making an ambitious leader like Charan Singh as Prime Minister, he broke the Janata Party
 is bich, janata main indira gandhi kii image chamakaane ke liye har hatkande aajamaae
 Also prepared his Young Brigade in Congress
 uske baad nateeja ye niklaa ki 1980 ke janvari main naa sirf congress ne centre main sarkaar banaai, balki 8 rajyon main bhi congress kii sarkaar bani
 Then on the Congress ticket, 100 such youths won the election, who used to do politics on Sanjay's style
 maaruti kii daali neenvped lagane kaa andolan or bharat main chizon ke banane par jor unke kaarykram kaa pramukh hissaa tha
 He tried to design Maruti in the workshop
 bharat main maaruti 800 kii neenv sanjay gandhi ne hi daali thi
 Sanjay Gandhi died in a plane crash on June 23, 1980

 com / rpalhrmfxa bihar main teji se ghate raajnneeti ghatnachakra ke baad ab nitish kumaar chhathvin baar rajya ke mukhyamantri ban chuke hai
 From Modi to Yogi congratulating him on Twitter
 nitish kumaar ek baar phir bijepi ke saath hai, ve lalu kaa saath chhod chuke hai
 Sushil Modi has also sworn in as Deputy Chief Minister once again
 lekin, aapako yaad dilaa den ki chunaav se kuch maheene pehle inhen nitish kumaar ne bijepi ko 'bhujang' bataaya tha
 Nitish Kumar made a tweet at the time which was a line of Rahimdas's couplet, "chandan venom not spread, wrapped rahut bhujang"
 is twit ne bihar kii raajnneeti main khub hallaa machaaya, pehle logon ne sochaa ki yah twit taaja-taaja hue 'mahagathbandhan' or khaas kar lalu ko lekar kiya gaya he lekin baad main jediu ne spasht kiya ki yah twit bijepi ko lekar kiya gaya tha
 Now Nitish is once again with the 'bhujang' of that time
 is maukey par ham aapako bataane ja rahe hai ki aakhir aisa kya hua ki pehle nitish ne modi se 'baghawat' kii or phir dobaaraa unki 'sharan' main pahunch gaye
 Nitish's importance is important
 If we look from the background, then Nitish Kumar's 'important' is clearly visible behind this political upheaval
 desh kii raajnneeti main tamaam aise netaa hai jin par kai tarah ke aarope lage lekin ve apane padon par lagaataar bane rahe jab tak court ne unhen doshi qaraar nahin kar diya
 Tejaswi's case is still under investigation but Nitish does not like to bow down at all
 ve apni saaf-suthri chhavi ko daagdar nahin karnaa chaahate the isliye alag ho gaye
 But then why they separated from BJP also arises
 iske peeche bhi nitish kumaar kaa ahm hi tha
 Actually, Nitish Kumar could not bear Modi on himself
 nitish kumaar bihar kii raajnneeti main hi nahin desh kii raajnneeti main kaaphi pehle se hi ahm bhoomika nibhaa chuke the
 They were willing to work under the leadership of their counterpart politicians but not with a leader less than their own
 yahi vajah thi ki jab bijepi kii goa meeting main narendra modi kaa naam aage aayaa to unhone adwani kaa jhanda buland kiya
 And finally, to stop Modi's chariot, he formed a grand alliance with his anti-lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD, Samajwadi Party, Janata Dal (secular), Indian National Lok Dal, Samajwadi Janata Party (national)
 hua bhi yahi bihar main bijepi ko karaari shikast jhelni padi or unhen 37 siton ke nuksaan ke saath sirf 58 seat par santosh karnaa padaa
 Nitish was a Union Minister when Modi became the General Secretary of the BJP
 Let me tell you that the victory of the BJP in the Gujarat Assembly elections in 1998 tied Modi's head and made him the General Secretary of the BJP, moving from the post of National Secretary in May that year

 lekin thik usee vakt nitish kumaar atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main bhootal parivahan mantri kaa pad sambhaal rahe the
 In 2001, when BJP gave Modi a chance to take charge of Gujarat, Nitish Kumar was the Minister of Agriculture in the Central Government
 krishi mantralay ke baad nitish kumaar ne kai saalon tak rail mantralay bhi sambhala
 After this, he became the Chief Minister of Bihar, for the first time in March 2000, for only 8 days and then continuously from November 24, 2005, he handed over his throne to his leader Jitan Ram Manjhi for just 278 days
 maanjhi 20 may 2014 se 22 farvari 2015 tak bihar ke mukhyamantri rahe
 On the other hand, Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat for a total of 4610 days
 modi ne 7 oktober 2001 ko gujarat kii satta sanbhali thi or ve pradhanmantri banane tak 22 may 2014 tak is pad par bane rahe
 It is clear that Nitish's stature was bigger than Modi at that time
 jis vajah se unhone gujarat dangon kaa purajor virodh to kiya hi saath hi saath jab kendriya raajnneeti main modi kaa kad badhanaa shuru hua to unhone adwani kaa naam pradhanmantri ummidavaar ke liye aage kiya or antat: bijepi kaa saath chhod diya
 Over time, both BJP and Nitish's defeat of Akal Behar made the BJP realize that Nitish Kumar's stature in Bihar's politics is huge
 to vahiin modi-shah kii jodi ke netritv main bijepi ko mil rahi lagaataar jeet ne nitish kumaar ko bhi yah ehsaas kara diya ki bihar kii satta main agle kuch saal bane rahanaa he to bijepi ke saath hi bane rahanaa hoga
 Used Lalu to teach Modi a lesson! Now that Nitish Kumar is once again with the BJP, now it is certain that he has to be accused that Nitish Kumar used Lalu only to teach Modi a lesson
 vidhansabha kii ganit bhi isi ore ishaara karti he
 Nitish Kumar belongs to the Kurmi caste of lesser numbers in BJP, while Lalu Yadav's vote bank was Yadav as well as Muslim
 nitish ye samajhate the ki agar donon alag-alag lade to kabhi jeet nahin sakate
 This is the reason that in the 2015 elections, where JDU and RJD contested 101–101 seats, the Congress gave 41 seats
 lalu kii party kul 80 siton par jiti to nitish kii party ko 71 seat par vahiin congress sirf 27 seat par jeet darj kara pai
 Despite being the largest party, Lalu made Nitish Kumar the chief minister as per the condition of the grand alliance
 lekin 20 maheene baad nitish kumaar samaj gaye ki ab agar saath rahe to unki chhavi ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he jiske baad unhone 26 july 2017 ko apane pad se istipha de diya or 27 july 2017 ko bijepi ke samarthan ke saath ek baar phir bihar ke mukhyamantri ke taur par shapath lee

 The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court, in an important judgment, has said that the child born as a result of rape will have the right to inherit the property of his real father (the rapist)
 nyaayamurti shabihul hasanan tathaa nyaayamurti di
 K
 upaadhyaay kii peeth ne mangalvaar ko yah ahm faisla dete hue kaha ki balaatkaar ke kaaran janmi santan ko duraachaar ke abhiyukt kii nazaij aulad mana jayega or uskaa uski sampatti par haq hoga
 However, the court has also said that if such a child is adopted by another person or couple, then he will have no right over the property of his real father
 adaalat ne kaha 'ham yah maan sakate hai ki jahaan tak uttaradhikaar kaa maamla he to sambandhit santan kaa janm kin paristhitiyon main hua, yah myne nahin rakhata
 The issue of succession is decided by the respective personal law
 yah baat apraasangik he ki navjaat shishu balaatkaar kaa nateeja he yaa phir aapasi sahmati se bane yon sambandhon kaa parinaam he
 ' nyaayalay ne yah bhi kaha ki agar balaatkaar ke kaaran janmi aulad ko koi vyakti yaa dampati god nahin letaa he to uttaradhikaar ke liye use adaalat ke kisi nirdesh kii jarurat nahin hogi or vah sambandhit personal lau ke jariye apane asal pita kii sampatti main hissaa paane kii hakdaar hoga
 The bench said that the right to inherit the property of the real father is related to complex personal law which is governed either by law or tradition
 nyaaypalika ke liye balaatkaar ke nattejey main paidaa hui aulad ke liye vaaris ke taur par haq se sambandhit koi siddhanth yaa niyam tay karnaa sambhav nahin hoga
 The court said that any such move of the court would be legalized and would be cited for future decisions, so it would not be appropriate to do such a thing
 adaalat ne yah aadesh ek balaatkaar peedit 13 varshiya ladki ke bachche kii parvarish kii jimmedaari child welfare socity ko saunpte hue diya
 The petitioner had urged the court to order its good future and to initiate the process of adoption of her child
 yachi kaa kahana he ki vah tathaa uskaa pita navjaat bachche ko apane saath rakhane ko taiyaar nahin he
 The court has ordered the state government to provide free education to the raped victim girl till graduation and to provide additional compensation of Rs 10 lakh in addition to the Rs 3 lakh already received
 adaalat ne kaha he ki in rupayon ko kisi rashtriyakrut bank main phixd diposit kiya jaae
 When the girl turns 21, she will be entitled to the full amount
 court ne yah bhi nirdesh die hai ki rajya sarkaar balaatkaar peedita kii padhai puri hone ke baad use naukari bhi degi
 The court has also directed proper care of the rape victim's newborn in the hospital
 child welfare socity nyaay mitra kii nigaraanee main use god dene kii prakriya puri karegi
 The comments garib parivaar se taalluk rakhane vaali 13 varshiya ladki is saal ke shuru main balaatkaar ke kaaran garbhvatee ho gai thi
 The family came to know about this after about seven months, but by then the maximum 21 weeks prescribed for safe abortion had passed
 aise main ladki ke parijan ne garbhpaat kii ijaajat lene ke liye adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha
 The victim said that she could not live with the sign of the horrific incident that happened to her
 adaalat ke nirdesh par banaae gaye doctoron ke ek panel ne jaanch karke bataaya tha ki saat maah ke garbhadhaaran ke baad use giraane se garbhvatee ladki kii maut ho sakati he

 The court said, 'we can assume that as far as succession is concerned, the circumstances under which the child was born does not matter

 It is irrelevant whether the newborn is the result of rape or the result of consensual sex

 daaen haath ke ballebaaj ne dhairyapurvak pehle bhartiya pari ko sambhala or phir haath khole
 Both batsmen made the biggest partnership of the eighth wicket for India
 dhoni or bhuvi ne aathven wicket ke liye 100 ran jode
 In partnership of both, Bhuvi played more open shots
 bhartiya pari ke aakhri chaar chauke bhuvi ke balle se nikle
 However, there was some hope for Sri Lanka on one occasion when Dhoni missed a shot off the ball of Vishwa Fernando and the ball hit the wickets
 haalanki gilliyaan or nahin giri or dhoni batch gaye
 At this time India needed less than fifty runs
 iske baad bhuvi ne ek shandaar chakka jadaa or ab bharat ko 30 se kam ranon kii jarurat thi
 Once again, Bhuvi changed gears and hit consecutive fours to dwarf the target and Sri Lanka's hopes
 isse pehle srilanka ke 236 ranon kaa peechha karne utari bhartiya team ko rohit sharma or shikhar dhawan (49) ne dhansu shuruyaat di
 Both batsmen scored 15 for the first wicket
 3 over main 109 ran jode
 On this score, Rohit Sharma (54) returned to the pavilion and the Indian team got trapped in a vortex
 dhananjaya ne srilanka kii ore se shandaar gendbaaji karte hue 6 wicket hasil kiye or bhartiya pari ko jhakzor kar rakh diya
 However, Dhoni's patience and Bhuvi's controlled shots derailed Dhananjaya's efforts

 At present, Chaudhary Santokh Singh is a Congress MP from Jalandhar

 While many current and former mlas are also seeking tickets from Jalandhar
 drugs maamle main akali-bijepi sarkaar ke dauraan mantri pad se haath dhone vaale sarwan singh fillore ne bhi jalandhar se daawa pesh kar diya he
 He has left the Akali Dal and joined the Congress
 6 baar vidhayak rahe fillore ko supreme court se raahat mil chuki he
 On the other hand, Pawan Kumar Tinu also contested the last Lok Sabha election on an Akali Dal ticket
 lekin congress ke choudhary santokh singh se pichad gaye the
 Now the party can once again bet on Pawan Kumar Tinu
 2014 kaa janadesh16veen loksabhaa main jalandhar surakshit seat se congress ke santokh singh choudhary ne akali dal ke pawan kumaar tinu ko 70,981 voton se haraaya tha

 This seat was not secured before the 2009 elections
 jalandhar loksabhaa seat se purv pradhanmantri inder kumaar gujral ne do baar jeet hasil kii thi

 jalandhar loksabhaa seat par 1952 se lekar 17 baar loksabhaa chunaav or ek baar upachunaav hua he
 In which Congress has won 13 times
 jabaki akali dal ko do baar 1977 or 1996 ko jeet mili thi

 saamaajik taana-banajalandhar loksabhaa ke andar 9 vidhansabha siten aati hai
 Which includes Phillaur (safe), Nakodar, Shahkot, Kartarpur (safe), Jalandhar West (safe), Jalandhar Central, Jalandhar North, Jalandhar Cantt and Adampur (safe)

 jalandhar kaa naam rakshas ke naam par rakhaa gaya he, jiskaa ullekh puraana or mahabharat main bhi he
 Whereas according to Srimadmadevi Bhagavata Purana, Shiva had a fourth son named Jalandhar
 lekin jalandhar shiv kaa sabase bada dushman tha
 Even today in Jalandhar, the temple of Goddess Vrinda, wife of Asuraraj Jalandhar, is located in Mohalla Kot Kishanchand
 vahiin kuch maanate hai ki jalandhar kaa arth pani ke andar hota he or yahaan par sutluj or 20 nadiyon kaa sangam hota he isliye is jagah kaa naam jalandhar rakhaa gaya
 Jalandhar was fiercely looted by Mahmud Ghaznavi, and during the Mughal period, Jalandhar was the principal administrative town between Vyas and Sutlej
 jalandhar ek bada audyogic shahar he, yahaan chamade or khel kii vastuon kaa adhik utpaadan hota he
 The Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh are now in the seventh and last phase
 is charan main upi kii 13 loksabhaa siten he, jahaan 19 may ko matdaan honge
 All these seats are from Purvanchal area and their responsibility is on the shoulders of Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi
 lekin priyanka gandhi purvanchal ko chhodkar madhya pradesh punjab main party ko jitaane ke liye pasinaa baha rahi hai
 In such a situation, the question is starting to arise that in Purvanchal the Congress is full of superstition that it is winning the electoral battle or it has surrendered completely
 aakhri charan main uttar pradesh kii maharajaganj, gorakhpur, kushinagar, devaria, bansgaanv, ghosi, salempur, baliya, gajipur, chandauli, varanasi, mirzapur or robertsganj seat par 19 may ko matdaan hone hai
 The last day of campaigning in these seats is on Friday i
e
 May 17
 is tarah chunaav prachaar ke liye mahaj teen din kaa samay baaki he
 In such a situation, if Priyanka Gandhi enters the election campaign in Purvanchal, how will she be able to cover 13 seats in the next three days? In 2014, the BJP managed to win all these seats in 2014, which are elections in Purvanchal
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne badi majbootee ke saath chunavi maidan main utari he
 SP chief Akhilesh and BSP president Mayawati are holding joint public meetings in Purvanchal continuously
 yahi nahin pradhanmantri narendra modi or siem yogi adityanath bhi in siton par chunaav prachaar tej kar die hai
 For the last two days, the PM has been campaigning on the seats in these areas
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or mahasachiv priyanka gandhi abhi tak upi ke aakhri charan kii siton par chunavi prachaar main abhi tak nahin utre hai
 While the Congress is contesting strongly on many seats
 priyanka gandhi purvi uttar pradesh kii prabharee hai or in siton ko jitaane kii jimmedaari unheen ke kandhon par he
 Despite this, not being seen in the election campaign is raising questions
 jabaki priyanka gandhi ne raajnneeti main entry kii thi to mana ja rahaa tha ki priyanka gandhi purvanchal main party ko jitaane ke liye puri takat jhonk dengi
 With Priyanka Gandhi leaving her candidates in Purvanchal, the Congress is sweating to win the candidate by conducting road shows and public meetings in Ujjain, Ratlam and Indore in Madhya Pradesh on Monday
 itnaa hi nahin mangalvaar ko priyanka gandhi punjab main prachaar ke liye utari hai
 However, it is believed that Priyanka Gandhi has proposed programs in Varanasi on Wednesday and Mirzapur on Thursday
 gauratlab he ki congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne uttar pradesh main apane chunavi abhiyaan kii shuruuaat prayagraj se kaashi ke liye kiya tha
 During this time, he directly and indirectly focused many seats in Purvanchal
 priyanka is daure ke baad varanasi abhi tak nahin gai hai

 ek ahm faisla sunaate hue supreme court ne kaha he ki rape or rape va hatya ke maamle main umrakaid kii sajaa kaat rahe logon ko sajaa main chhot dekar reeha nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Revising its earlier orders, the Supreme Court lifted the ban on the decision to prematurely release convicts serving life sentences across the country
 lekin saath kii kai sharten bhi laga deen
 The five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court pronounced these orders on Thursday
 supreme court ne kaha ki ab rajya umrakaid ke doshiyon ko reeha kar sakenge lekin iske liye kuch maanak tay kiye gaye hai
 Those convicted of rape and rape and murder cannot be released from life imprisonment
 jin keson main sibiai jaisi central agency ne jaanch kii he or jin maamalon main central act lage hai, unke doshiyon ko bhi reeha nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The comments supreme court ne kaha ki jin keson main court ne aadesh main umrakaid ke liye puri umr kaid main likhaa he or jinamein kam se kam vakt jail main gujaarne kaa aadesh likhaa he, unhen bhi raahat nahin di ja sakati
 For example, in many cases, the court decides that a convict cannot be released for life for 20 or 25 years ahead of time
 iskaa matlab he ki sarkaar is vakt se pehle uski arji par reeha karne ke faisle par gaur nahin kar sakati
 The Darsal law provides that the convicts of life imprisonment may be exempted from imprisonment after imprisonment for 14 years or 20 years
 darasal rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron kii rihaai ke maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan pichley saal july main supreme court ne sabhi rajyon se kaha tha ki kisi bhi umrakaid ke doshi ko reeha nahin kiya jayega
 The Supreme Court said that now states will be able to release the convicts of life imprisonment but certain standards have been set for this
 rape or rape va hatya ke doshi ko umrakaid se rihaai nahin di ja sakati
 In cases where a central agency like CBI has investigated and in cases where the Central Act has been put in place, the culprits of the accused cannot be released
 tippaniyan The Supreme Court said that the cases in which the court has written the entire life imprisonment for life imprisonment in the order and those who have written the order to spend at least time in jail, also cannot be relieved
 udhaaharan ke taur par kai maamalon main court tay karti he ki doshi ko umrakaid main 20 yaa 25 saal tak vakt se pehle reeha nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This means that the government cannot consider the decision to release his application before this time
 prasal kanoon main praavdhaan he ki umrakaid ke doshiyon ko 14 saal yaa phir 20 saal kii kaid ke baad sajaa main chhot di ja sakati he
 In fact, in July last year, during the hearing of the release of Rajiv Gandhi's killers, the Supreme Court had told all the states that no life imprisonment would be released
 supreme court ne kaha ki jin keson main court ne aadesh main umrakaid ke liye puri umr kaid main likhaa he or jinamein kam se kam vakt jail main gujaarne kaa aadesh likhaa he, unhen bhi raahat nahin di ja sakati
 For example, in many cases, the court decides that a convict cannot be released for life for 20 or 25 years ahead of time

 When asked about the performance of Indian bowlers, Kapil said, "we can see that bowling is weak
" mujhe yah kehane kii jarurat nahin he
 He said, if you compare the bowlers with the team's batsmen then yes, definitely bowling is weak
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki ve bilkul gendbaaji nahin kar sakate
 He said, he is the same bowler who has won India in many matches in the last two years
 bangladesh or england ke khilaaf bhartiya ballebaaji kaaphi shandaar thi lekin gendbaajon ne niraash kiya
 In the first match, the Indian batsmen had scored a huge score of 370 runs but Bangladesh scored an excellent batting performance by scoring 283 runs

 lekin agar hamaare gendbaajon ne pehle do maichon main kharaab gendbaaji kii to iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki unhone wicket hasil nahin kiye the
 Kapil said, in the matches played in the last two years, he was the same bowler who has won many matches for India by performing brilliantly
 main sachmuch unki aalochana nahin karnaa chahta
 Kapil, however, admitted that there was some criticism, as India should have defeated England by setting an impossible target of 338 runs
 unhone yahaan ek kaarykram ke dauraan kaha, main aalochana nahin karnaa chahta
 But yes, at one level, you set a target of 338 runs and despite that you could tie
 meraa matlab he ki england ne behtareen cricket khelaa or mere hisaab se ve jeet gayi
 After 338 runs we should not have lost or tie the match

 The manifesto that the BJP had released for the promise of bjp's Madhya Pradesh elections was named 'darshan Patra'
 madhya pradesh main chauthi baar satta main vaapasi kii koshish karne ke liye bijepi ne janata se vaadon kii jhadi laga di thi
 There was a promise to create 10 lakh jobs every year to provide jobs to the youth, to provide start-up facilities to young entrepreneurs, to set up new industrial townships in the state and to set up a Merchant Welfare Fund

 India thus equaled the seven-match series 1–1

 Three bowlers from India, Ishant Sharma, and Vinaykumar and Ravinder Jadeja scored 70 or more runs, while Australia's Mitchell Johnson, Clint mckay, Xavier Doherty, James Faulkner all proved to be expensive bowlers
 dhawan or rohit ne shuru se hi gendbaajon par haaavee hone kii ranneeti apanaai or unhone jo neenv rakhi aakhir main vah majboot sabit hui
 Dhawan initially supported Bhagya
 jab vah 18 ran par the tab client maikaay kii gend par wicketiper bread hadine ne unka kaich choda
 She then survived a reliable run-out appeal on a personal total of 42 runs
 baayen haath kaa yah ballebaaj haalanki apana chauthaa shatak puraa nahin kar paaya

 kohli ne aate hi lambey shot khilne shuru kar die
 He hit his second six of his innings on Doherty to take the score to 200 runs in the 30th over
 ab bhartiya ballebaajon ne tii-20 kii style main ballebaaji karnaa shuru kar diya tha or chhakkon kii barsaat hone lagi thi
 Kohli taught every bowler a hard lesson
 savai maansingh stadium main unki ballebaaji dekhakar aisa lag rahaa tha ki maano yah duniya kaa sabase aasaan kaam ho
 Rohit was not giving up cancer despite the cramps
 unhone johnson par chaukaa jadkar apana teesraa or salaami ballebaaj ke rup main pehla shatak puraa kiya
 Kohli too soon completed his 16th ODI century while Rohit hit India in the 44th over of the innings with a four, six and then four boundaries off Maxwell to reach India

 He plundered 122 runs in the last ten overs

 Watson first set foot at the crease and then taught both India spinners a tough lesson
 unhone baikfoot par jaakar midwicket or deep midwicket par achche shot lagaae
 He hit six fours and three sixes in his 53-ball innings
 iske baad baili or maxwell kaa jalawaa dikhaa
 Maxwell played only 32 balls and hit seven fours and a six

 pichley kai roj se baar baar lagaataar kisan babu raav hajaare urf anna hajaare tivi par aakar hamen yahi bataa rahe the
 But when the matter came face to face instead of TV
 to anna hajaare kii tabiyat kharaab ho gai
 Mamta Banerjee came in a hurry because of this she said that it is not right for me to say anything right now
 anna ji se milakar hi boluungi
 Mamata Banerjee's party Trinamool Congress called a rally at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi on Wednesday
 agenda tha anna hajaare ke bahaane mamata banerjee ko rashtriya manch par sthapit karnaa
 During this time there were also people who were in the news sometimes as a side kick
 masalan, lakshmi nagar ke binni, jo kejariwal ke khilaaf baghawat karne ke baad khud ko anna kaa sipaahi bataane main lage the
 But the main screenplay was around two characters
 mamata or anna
 The rally was to begin at 10 am
 magar dopaher tak maidan to dur kursiyaan bhi nahin bhar pain
 Mamta Banerjee also reached the stage after 2 pm with a smile of compulsion
 or anna hajaare kii sahaayak sunita godara media ko bataa rahi hai ki anna hajaare kii tabiyat bahut kharaab he

 magar us andolan ke kathith nayakon ne baad main jis tarah ke raajnneetik pantare dikhaae
 Everyone understood that the movement is a platform
 makasad to gaadi pakad manzil par pahunchnaa he
 Anna Hazare himself continued to chant the non-political platform and then one day became Mamatamayi
 ab unke kathith naitik netritv par, unki raajnneetik samaj par or unke lagaataar badalte stand par bhi sawaal uth rahe hai
 It is being said that Anna Hazare is surrounded by a coterie, who is using Anna according to his political advantages

 Sunita said that the party should have held its rally in the evening instead of day
 or iske liye ravivaar kaa din chunanaa chahie tha
 He said that the rally was not properly publicized
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki puri dilli ke log anna hajaare ko dekhnaa, sunanaa or milanaa chaahate hai
 But the party did not arrange it properly
 aise main sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya beemaari sirf ek bahaanaa he
 Why it was reported at the last minute
 or kyon ye sab mamata banerjee ke saath hi baar baar ho rahaa he

 'jindagi bachaane ke liye raktadan, desh bachaane ke liye karen matdaan'is voter card rupi nimantran patr kii khaas baat ye he ki iscardke peeche kannada bhashaa main ek sandesh likhaa hua he

 Only after passing it, they will be given a degree certificate
 'bataa den ki pichley saal hindi department ne kaha tha ki college aise chaatro kii pahchaan karen, jinhone kaksha 8 ke baad hindi nahin padhi ho or unke liye ek course shuru kiya jaae
