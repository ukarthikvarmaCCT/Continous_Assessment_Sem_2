 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley described Rahul Gandhi as an innocent and less knowledgeable leader and said that he does not know what the Modi government has done for the army
 desh kii suraksha se jude masalon par charchaa ke liye ajtak dwaara yojit vishesh 'suraksha sabha' ko sambodhit karte hue jetali ne yah baat kahi
 Jaitley said, 'rahul has repeatedly said that those who belong to Para Military give martyr status, but the truth is that neither the army nor the central security forces are given any such status
 upie sarkaar ne sena or kendriya balon ko is maamle main samanta dene kaa virodh kiya

 Had there been a Combat Aircraft at that time, the result would have been better
 aap 100-150 kimi kii duuri se target par hamalaa kar sakate the
 The talk of bringing Rafael was going on since 2000 and all the teams said it was better
 2007 main tender bhi aae, 2012 main aapane kaha ki rafel best he
 After years of negotiation, they finally closed the deal
 aapane kaha ki rafel thik he, lekin jis process se kharida janaa he vah sahi nahin he is tarah congress ne pehle hi kharid ko 3 se 4 saal let kiya
 Since 2007, when we deal in 2016, then the price will go up, the CAG and the Supreme Court have misunderstood your question, yet you are raising the question

 More than half of the people believe that the absence of Jayalalithaa will now shatter the AIADMK

 The India today-karvy Opinion Poll shows that it is becoming difficult for the AIADMK to maintain its voter base
 2016 ke chunaav main AIADMK ko vot dene vaale har teen voter main se ek ne tay kiya he ki ab vah is party ko vot nahin degaa
 About 60 per cent of these disgruntled voters are seen leaning towards Rajinikanth's party, while 26 per cent of them may turn to the DMK
 5
 According to the survey, some DMK voters are also seen going towards Rajinikanth's party
 haalanki AIADMK kii tulana main uskaa voter base kuch surakshit he
 One out of every five DMK voters has gone away from the party
 in asantusht matadaataaon main se 63 fisadi rajnikant kii party ko vot dene kaa man bana chuke hai
 6
 survey ke anusaar rajnikant kii party kii tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main acchhee shuruyaat hoti dikh rahi he
 If elections are held now, the party may get 16 percent votes
 yah tab kii baat he jab abhi rajnikant kii party kaa na to koi aupchaarik naam tay hua he or na hi kisi simbal kii ghoshnaa hui he
 Superstar-turned-politician Rajinikanth has not even started any campaign yet
 isliye aisa lagata he ki agle chunaav tak to unki party rajya main ek majboot raajnneetik takat ban jaaegi
 7
 haalanki survey ke anusaar rajya kii bahusankhya janata yah maanati he ki bahari hone kii vajah se tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main rajnikant ke liye jagah bananaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Rajni will have to deal with this problem
 yahi nahin, survey main shaamil aadhe se zyada log yah bhi maanate hai ki jayalalita ke baad jo khalipan aayaa he usko bharne main rajnikant abhi sakasham nahin hai or isi vajah se philhal rajya main DMK kaa voter base badhata dikh rahaa he
 8
 survey ke anusaaraiadhnkhke bheetar abhi safataur se koi tasviir nahin ubhar pai he ki jayalalita kii viraasat kaa asli vaaris koun ho saktaa he
 o Panneerselvam has a slight edge over EK Palaniswami, but it is not common among those surveyed
 survey main shaamil 30 fisadi se zyada log yah maanate hai ki AIADMK ke maujuuda netritv jaise o panniraselvam, ike palanisvami, titivi dinakaran, deepa jayakumar or shashikala natarajan main se koi bhi jayalalita kii viraasat kaa asal vaaris nahin he
 9
 survey main shaamil 64 fisadi kaa bahumat varg ike palanisvami ke pradarshan ko kharaab yaa bahut kharaab maanata he
 There is a lot of dissatisfaction about the key economic and social parameters such as job creation, the condition of schools, colleges, hospitals and industries, the condition of farmers, etc

 It spreads rapidly when exposed to mucus, saliva or feces
 HFMD ko nursery skulon or play skulon main kai baar sankramak rog kii tarah failte dekha gaya he, khaas taur se garmiyon or uske thik baad ke samay main
 Symptoms take three to six days after exposure to the HFMD virus
 doctoron kaa maananaa he ki doctor ko dikhaane main deree kii jaae to halaat bighad bhi sakate hai
 Cases coming up in schools: 8 cases of HFMD were reported in Sardar Patel Vidyalaya of Lodhi Estate, after which three weeks' leave was declared in the nursery section of the school
 nanhee chaatra riya (badla hua naam) kii maa ne bataaya, 'meri beti shuukravaar ko jab skool se lauti to uske haath main ek circular tha, jisamen likhaa tha ki skool main aise 8 maamle saamne aae hai
 Therefore, the leave of nursery wing was declared from September 23 to October 16 in terms of children's safety
 'parents ko satark rahane kii salaahskool ne parents ke liye sujhaavon kii ek list bhi bheji he, jisamen likhaa he ki HFMD ko lekar satark rahane kii disha main unhen kya-kya karnaa chahie
 It also includes taking common signs of infection seriously, avoiding taking children to a crowded place, washing hands with soap, keeping toys clean
 sardaar patel vidhyalay ke alaava or bhi kai skulon ne HFMD se judi adwijuri jari kii he
 Four children have also been found suffering from the disease at 'the Learning Tree Play School' located at Sujan Singh Park
 yahaan bhi ab parents ke liye notice lagaaya gaya he
 Taapsee Pannu is going to rock the comedy in the beginning of the new year
 unki film dil junglee 16 farvari ko relies hone vaali he jiskaa trailor laanch ho gaya he
 There is tremendous temper of comedy and there is a lot of fun with fun
 taapasi kii jodi saaqib saleem ke saath he jo 'mujhase frendship karoge' or 'mere dead kii maruti' main apni abhinay kala se logon ko prabhavit kar chuke hai
 The film is directed by Alee Sen

 The rain starts as soon as the summer holidays are over
 barsaat jiskaa intjaar puri duniya kuch is tarah karti he jiske aa jane maatr se sari dikkatein-pareshaaniyaan hawa ho jaaengi or kare bhi kyo na
 After all, they beat Loo, the tyranny of the sun all disappears with one stroke
 barish jiskaa intjaar ek saamaanya naagarik se lekar khetihar-kisaan kiya karata he
 In our childhood days, we used to wait for fun instead of farming
 jab ham apni bin patavaar kii naav lekar chal padate the
 We would support him until he merges with a heavy waterflood
 berokatoke or beparwaah
 During school days, we used to sit in our classes and sometimes request Indra, and sometimes keep the list of the names of all the cities with the end of the myth, believing the mythical stories to be true
 badal kii halki si umad-ghumad ko dekh kar apana peeth thapthapate ki jaise sab-kuch kisivayumandaleey dabaavake bajaay hamaari hi vajah se ho rahaa ho
 If you correct the cassette of songs that are heard in the rain, then you start tying the swing before the rain
 barsaat apane saath pake jamun bhi to laati thi or jo majaa jamun ped se tod kar or maar kar khaane main hai wo kharid kar khaane main kahaan?
 The rain also brings with it the natural ripening of mangoes
 daal ke pake aamon kaa swaad to bas jisane khaaya he vahi mahasoos kar saktaa he
 Pale yellow frogs coming out of the village katala-talaiyan with the first rain
 ham jinke peeche thakaan kii had tak uchhal-kud karte
 After every rains, the village pokhars and ponds inspected how many inches of rain this time
 is barish kaa hamaari kheti par kya asar padegaa, vagairah-vagairah
 Rains would also bring with him the news of school closure several times
 pataa chalata ki aaj skool main reni de he
 However, our luck in this matter has always been bad
 skool kii timming shuru hone se thik pehle hibarish kii jadhiruk jaati or phir hamaare ek bhi bahaane nahin chalate
 Then it would start raining as soon as we were transported to school
 ham man hi man indra ko gariyaate or apana sa munh lekar class kii khidki se barish ko nihaarte rahete
 The rain brought with itself the best dumplings and dumplings of lentils
 ab to bhutte saal bhar milte hai magar jab dadaji apane khet se bhutte tod kar laate or daadi unhen koyale ke angaare par bhuna karti to uski baat hi juda hoti
 Rain still occurs, but now where is the previous thing
 wo beficri kahaan
 Now generations are afraid of being exposed to the rain
 aisa lagata he jaise wo koi maati kii dhuhin hon or barish main bah jaaengi
 Instead of being in the playground during the rain, the game is played on the computer screen
 to itani sari baaten kehane kaa labboluab ye he ki barish ho to jaraa khul kar bhing lo
 It is possible that something untold and unintelligible in one corner of the heart is extinguished and you feel something good
 baad baaki feel aa jaae to dhire se shukriya kah dijiega
 It is written very well

 On the other hand, if the Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Trinamool Congress are engaged in the exercise of the Grand Alliance, the Lok Sabha is likely to be hung
 mahagathbandhan bana to trishanku sansad!motn, july 2018 ke anusaar bhaajapa ke liye zyada chintajanak vah sambhaavna he jisamen vipaksh agar ekajute ho jaataa he or mahagathbandhan bana letaa he, jisamen mukhya rup se congress, tiemasi, sapa, basapa or jedy(es) honge
 So this alliance can come on par with NDA by winning 224 seats
 jisaki mahagathbandhan kii surat main siten ghatakar 228 rah jaaengi
 In such a situation, the Parliament will be hung and the BJP will reduce its seats to 194
 haalanki phir bhi bijepi sabase badi party hogi lekin sarkaar banane ke liye use partiyon kii tut-foot par nirbhar hona padegaa
 In this situation, the credibility of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the most powerful face of BJP, will be shocked
 sambhav he ki ve aise gathbandhan kii sarkaar se dur rahen
 There is also a third possibility in this survey, in which if AIADMK joins NDA
 tab bhi endie kaa gathbandhan bahumat se peeche rah saktaa he
 Let us know that this survey of MOTN conducted in July shows that the BJP had a comfortable lead of 298 seats in the survey conducted a year ago, it has come down to 245 seats
 masalan bijepi apane dam par 272 siton ke bahumat ke aankade se 27 siten kam rahegi
 However, the survey also states that the NDA will be able to win 281 seats with its allies
 lihaaja uske aaj kii tulana main badi bahumat kii sahuuliyat nahin rahegi

 Another party spokesperson, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, however reacted cautiously, saying that Ramdev's decision to end the hunger strike and the Congress has nothing to do with it

 aaj ham aapako period se judi kuch aisi sachai bataa rahen hai, jo periods ko lekar aapke man main baithe dar ko bahut had tak kam kar degi
 Myth: Exercising during periods is dangerous Fact: If you have a habit of doing sex, you can exercise in your periods without worrying
 ek report ke anusaar har hafte 150 minute yaa kam se kam 75 minute eksrasij jarur karen
 Because the sweat coming during this period reduces the abdominal pain
 Myth:period ek hafte main khatm ho janaa chahiexct:har kisi kaa sharir alag tarah se kaam karata he
 So everyone's mensuration cycle is different
 badalati umr ke anusaar bhi is cycle main badlaav aate rahete hai
 Myth: There is no syndrome before periods Fact: You would be surprised to know that 50% of women worldwide are affected by pre-menstrual syndrome
 is dauraan mahilaon ko mood swing, pet dard, ghabrahat jaisi samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Myth: Women cannot be pregnant during periods Fact: Although there is less scope to conceive during periods
 lekin aisa bilkul nahin he ki mahila period ke samay pregnant nahin ho sakati
 Myth: Women who live with each other also have periods at the same time Fact: It is generally believed that people who live together have periods at the same time
 lekin aisa bilkul nahin he
 It is also said that if women eat the same type of food, exercise, sleep at one time, then they must have periods at the same time

 Many questions have arisen over the new posters and hoardings of the Delhi government dealing with dengue and chikungunya
 aam janata ko jaagruk karne bajaay sarkaar jaanaleva beemaari se dilliwaalon ko yuddh karne kii naseehat de rahi he
 At present, the AAP spokesperson is describing this as the creativity of the government, but the advertisement of the Kejriwal government, which spends the most budget on health, is very surprising
 har saal khatarnaak beemaari se jujhane vaali desh kii rajdhani mendengue or chikanguniyaake rokthaam ke liye na to paryaapt intjaam kiye jate hai, na hi logon ko jaagruk
 These days the Aam Aadmi Party government seems to be advising people to tackle the disease instead of making them aware
 dilli ke mukhya margon main lagaae gaye alag-alag hording par likhaa gaya he- 'is baar dengue-chikangunia ke kilaaf dilli vaale karenge yuddh'
 There is also a picture of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on this hoarding
 aam aadmi party ke mutabik sarkaar ke nae poster behad creative hai
 AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj says that in order to be aware when one message is to be delivered, the message has to be repackaged
 agar baar-baar ek hi poster dikhaaya jayega, to log usase bor ho jaaenge
 Such messages have been formulated to attract the attention of the people
 haalanki dengue or chikangunia kii rokthaam kaa kaam emsidi kaa he, lekin dilli sarkaar bhi jaagrukta failaati he, taaki log gharon main pani ikattha na hone den
 Before the MCD election, it is known that Arvind Kejriwal had asked the Delhiites to vote and said that if the BJP voted, the Delhiites themselves would be responsible for dengue and chikungunya
 ek sawaal par aap ke pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne apni sarkaar kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki chunaav se pehle kaha gaya tha ki bijepi hi dengue or chikangunia failaane ke liye zimmedaar he, lekin dobaaraa bijepi ko vot mila he or dilli sarkaar apni taraf se puri koshish karegi kidengue or chikanguniyaan faile
 Questions are being raised on the new hoardings of the government, because instead of fighting dengue and chikungunya, if people stop breeding mosquitoes, then people will not have to suffer the fatal disease
 haal hi main 'ajtak' ke rielity check main yah saamne aayaa tha ki kis tarah sarkari aspataalon main hi machhar punap rahe hai, lekin rokthaam kii bajaay agenciyaan or sarkaar ek duusare par aarope-pratyarope lagane main vyast hai
 After the failure of the last time, this time the government has asked the people to fight for dengue themselves
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki rokthaam or sahi jaankaree dene kii bajaae beemaari se ladane kii naseehat dena kya sahi kadam he? Car company Maruti Suzuki India registered a 50 percent increase in its sales in December last year

 Currently, the state capital is Raipur, which is proposed to be changed to Naya Raipur
 28 million se zyada kii jansankhya ke saath ye rajya desh main 17wein sthaan par aata he
 The state mainly consists of BJP and Congress
 loksabhaa chunaav jaise-jaise najadik aate ja rahe hai vibhinn rajyon main loklubhaavan yojanaon kii jhadi bhi lag rahi he
 Its biggest example is Odisha, where assembly elections are to be held along with Lok Sabha
 isi ke maddenjar, kisaanon ke liye naveen patnayak kii sarkaar ne kaaliya yojana shuru kii thi
 The State Government had started the Farmers Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (kalia) to help the farmers
 iskaa makasad, garibi kam karnaa or krishi kshetra main samruddhi badhanaa bataaya gaya
 But the plan also came under controversy
 ab uski parvaah na karte hue patnayak ne yuvaaon ke liye ek or pasa phenkaa he
 But it is also associated with Kalia
 kaaliya chaatravrutti naam kii yah yojana kaaliya yojana ke labhaarthiyon ke bacchon ke liye he jo takneekee or peshewar shiksha paanaa chaahate hai
 The government aims to develop human resources in the farming families through the Kalia Scholarship Scheme
 rajya sarkaar kaa daawa he ki kalitha yojana kisaanon ko madad ke liye banaai gai puure desh bhar main apane kism kii anokhi yojana he
 The government claims that other states are adopting the Kalia scheme
 kaaliya chaatravrutti yojana ke bare main rajya sarkaar kaa daawa he ki iske jariye kisaan pariwaron kaa koi bhi chaatr takneekee or profeshnal shiksha se achoota nahin rahegaa or apane sapanom ko puraa kar sakegaa
 Under this scheme, the state government will bear all the expenses such as course fees, hostel fees and mess fees for teaching the students of farmer families
 is yojana kaa phayda jald se jald kisaan pariwaron tak pahunche iske vaaste sarkaar ne vibhinn vibhaagon se kaaliya yojana ke labhaarthiyon ke bacchon kii suchi muhaiyaa karaane ko kaha he
 MBBS, BDS, BAMS, B, to poor farmer students
 pharma samet kul 13 takneekee yaa peshever vishyon kii padhai ke liye rajya sarkaar kii sahaayta milegi
 The government has also said that the Kalia scholarship amount will be transferred directly to the accounts of deserving students
 baharhaal, aalochakon ne krishi sankat ko odisha main ek pramukh chunavi mudda bataate hue kaaliya yojana kii aalochana kii he
 Critics say that the Patnaik government hurriedly started the Kalia scheme without any preparation
 odisha ke padosi rajyon telugana, pashchim bengal or madhya pradesh main sarkaron ne pehle hi kisaanon ke liye vibhinn ghoshnaaen kar di hai
 Therefore, the Patnaik government also announced this plan in a hurry
 par isse ek or kadam aage badhate hue naveen patnayak ne kaaliya chaatravrutti kii ghoshnaa bhi kar di he
 Obviously, Patnaik too does not want to take any risk in the election clock

 aapako yah jaanakar hairaani hogi ki desh main kai shankaracharya farji hai
 Mool Peeth is four and only his Shankaracharya is valid
 farji shankaracharya ujjain 'sinhasth' kshetra main pravesh nahin kar paaenge
 The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad has made up its mind to take strict decisions in this matter
 saath hi farji saadhuon ko jamaat se baahar karne ke liye ab har akhaada apane sadhu-santon, mahamandaleshwaron kaa parichay patr jari karegaa
 It will have the name of the monk, the name of the arena, the place and the signature of the officer of the arena
 sinhasth 2016 ke pehle sabhi ko parichay patr de die jaaenge
 All India Arena Council President Narendra Giri said this information
 'isse ghat rahi he sanathan dharm kii maryaada'nasik se elahabaad ja rahe akhaada parishad adhyaksh narendra giri ujjain sinhasth kii taiyaariyon kaa jayja lene ruke the
 In the discussion with the media, he expressed concern over the growing fake Shankaracharyas
 unhone kaha ki farji shankaraachaaryon kii vajah se sanathan dharm kii maryaada ghatati he
 So this time in Simhastha 2016, fake Shankaracharyas will not be allowed to enter
 desh main sirf 4 shankaracharya peeth hai or yahi maanya peeth rahenge
 '13 There is no dispute between the akharas' Similarly, to stop the fake monks, every arena council is being asked to issue a letter of introduction to their saints, Mahamandaleshwaras
 akhaadon main vivaad ke vishay par narendra giri ne kaha, '13 akhaadon ke bich koi vivaad nahin he
 We have the support of the three Ani Shrimhant Dharmadas, Madanmohandas and Ramkishan Das of the Vaishnava sect
 15 se 20 june ke bich ujjain main abhikhada parishad kii baithkahogi, jisamen teenon ani bhi shaamil honge
 In this meeting, construction work in the arena, preparation of the fair area, the status of Shipra, encroachment and other issues will be discussed
 ''chhini jaaegi mahamandaleshwar kii padavi'akhaadon ke bhitari vivaadon par unhone kaha yadi koi akhaada galati karata he to us par karrwai hona jaruri he, tabhi anushaasan rahata he
 He said that a letter is also being given to take over the post of Prehamand Maharaj Semhandameshwar of Ujjain
 abhaa akhaada parishad adhyaksh ne bataaya ki ujjain sinhasth kaa muhoort nasik kumbh khatm hone ke baad nikaala jayega
 After the end of Kumbh, bathing in Ujjain will be decided in a meeting with Pandits
 isi main tay hoga ki kitne shahi snaan honge

 pradhanmantri narendra modi 15 agast ko laal kile se apni dream skim modicare kaa khaakaa desh ke saamne rakhenge
 But even before the implementation of the scheme, through social websites and messages on social media people have been tricked into cheating people
 jaise hi aap'ayushmaan bharat'google main tip karenge to kai aise link khulenge jo mantralay kii aupchaarik website se mail khate hai
 On these, you will also see a picture of PM Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley

 There is a message in the message that PM will launch Yehskim on August 15 and it has been said to pay Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,200 for it
 saath main yah massej bhi he ki aap apane vahaan kaam karne vaale garib tabake ke logon ko iske bare main jarur bataaen

 According to him, the government has already identified the poorest of the poor families on economic grounds
 ab tak lagbhag 28 rajyon ne is yojana ke liye hami bhari he
 about 10
 74 karod garib pariwaron ko iskaa phayda milegaa
 Each family will be given an insurance amount of Rs 5 lakh
 unhone yah bhi saaf kiya ki iske liye sirf ek helpline number he 1455, uske alaava koi number nahin he
 After the implementation of the scheme, the government itself will send information to these families by sending a letter
 iske alaava log apane aas-paas ke sarkari aspataal yaa kaaman sarvice centre se labhaarthiyon kii jaankaree le sakate he
 Obviously, the government is also taking seriously the confusion being spread about the scheme and the conspiracy to raise money from the people and the police is preparing to take action in this matter

 Did you tell your family that you love a boy and he belongs to another culture, then your family also said the same? It is often the case that parents are worried about knowing this increases
 unhen ye chintaa sataane lag jaati he ki unki beti duusare culture main eujust kaise kar paaegi
 But do you know that marrying in another culture has many advantages, not one, and in a relationship that starts with love, the balance itself is formed: 1
 alag tarah kaa khan-pawegar aapkaa hone vaala partner kisi duusare culture kaa he, to aapke paas khaane-pine ke lihaaj se kaaphi acha mauka he
 Your food and drink will be completely different from your partner's food
 aise main aap donon hi do alag tarah kii treet injoy kar sakate hai
 2
 manoranjan ke lihaaj seye jaananaa kaaphi acha hota he ki aapkaa partner manoranjan ke liye kya karnaa pasand karata he
 His favorite books, literature, films and song and music will be connected to his culture somewhere
 aise main aapako bhi manoranjanan ke kuch nae sadhano ko explor karne kaa mauka mil jayega
 3
 nai jagah ghoomane kaa maukaagar aapkapartner duusare culture kaa he,to wo chahega ki aap uske culture ko kareeb se denkhe or jaane
 In such a situation, he would like to take you to his state or his city
 jisase aapako ghoomane ke saath hi ek nai jagah ke bare main or nae culture ke bare main jaanane kaa mauka milegaa
 4
 dohari naagarikta kaa maukaaye aapaki khushkismati he ki aapkaa partner duusare culture kaa he
 In such a situation, along with being in your culture, you also become a part of other culture
 ye mauka har kisi ko nahin miltaa
 5
 pyaar badhata hi jaataa hedgar aapkaa partner duusare culture kaa he or aapane uske culture ko dil se sweekaar kar liya he, to ye aapke rishte ko or majboot banayega
 Your partner will feel a sense of respect for you that you are devoted to him
 ye baat aapke rishte ko or majboot banaaegi
 6
 ek nai bhashaa seekhney kaa maukaek nai bhashaa siikhnaa aapke vyaktitv ko nikhaarane main madad karegaa
 Although you have to take coaching to learn a new language, but being a partner of other culture will make it much easier for you
 unki baton ko sunakar or apni koshish se aap bahut jaldi ek or bhashaa main maahir ho jaaengi
 7
 nae tyohaar or nae sanskaraye is anuthe or unic rishte kaa sabase khubasurat pahalu he, jisamen aap apane partner ko apane sanskaar or tyohaar sikhaane ke saath hi uske tyohaar or sanskaar kaa bhi hissaa ban jaaengi
 8
 aapako logon kii tavajjo milegiye kaaphi mjedaar point he
 If you have come from some other culture, your minor mistakes will be forgiven thinking that everything is new for you
 saath hi agar aap unke culture kaa kuch sahi kar lengi, to aapako vaahvahee bhi khub milegi

 susheel modi ne kaha he ki pichley 1 saal main bihar ke halaat bad se badtar ho gaye hai or isiilie hamane sarkaar ke 20 november ko 1 saal puure hone se thik 1 din pehle is report card ko jari kiya he taaki in sabhi sawaalon kaa bihar ke mukhyamantri jawaab de sake
 The opposition has demanded that when Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar presents his report card on November 20, he should present only the report card of the last one year and not the 11 years of his chief minister's term
 kyonki un 11 saalon main se 7
 The BJP was also involved in the government for 5 years
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii taraf se saafe sanket die ja rahe hai ki agar upie ko sarkaar banane laayak number nahin mili, to congress vipaksh main baithna pasand karegi
 Though the party will try to find a post poll alliance partner, the party does not have an opinion on things like supporting the Third Front
 salmaan khurshid jaise congressi netaa kah chuke hai ki 'sampradayik taaqaton' ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye congress tisare morche ko apana samarthan dekar sarkaar banavaa sakati he
 a similar thing was done on behalf of Sonia Gandhi's political secretary Ahmed Patel
 haalanki baad main unhone spashtikaran diya kii unke kehane kaa matlab tisare morche ko samarthan dene kaa nahin tha
 In fact, there are two main reasons behind the state of the congress
 ek to yah ki agar vah bahut kush hokar bhi soch le, to siton kii taadaad 100-110 se aage jaati nahin dikh rahi
 However, the party is insisting on bringing it to 140 seats
 apni patali haalat ke chalate congress ko pataa he ki satta is baar aasaan nahin
 Forming a government by manipulating in some way will not maintain stability and the other is that the alliance partners will pull their own accord, which can further increase the upa's infamy
 aise main satta se dur rahanaa hi behatar vikalp hoga
 But on the other hand, it wants to keep the BJP away from power, so a section of party leaders feel that the Congress should be ready to form a third front government even by giving support from outside
 lekin kaha ja rahaa he ki rahul iske liye taiyaar nahin
 Why does Rahul want to diet? To know this, we go back a little in the history of Congress
 indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad upji sahanubhuti kii lahar par savaar congress ko 1984 main 404 siten milin
 But on the issue of Bofors scam, terrorism in Punjab, the Congress government was surrounded
 1989 ke chunaav main congress ko mahaz 197 siten hasil hui, lekin congress ne sarkaar banane kii bajaay congress ke khilaaf ladakar jite veepi singh kii sarkaar banane di
 This government did not last long
 devilal kii bajaay veepi singh ko pradhanmantri banaae jane se naaraaz chandrashekhar ne janata dal se 64 saansadon ke saath alag raah lekar samaajawaadee janata party kaa gathan kiya
 The Congress supported and made Chandrashekhar the PM
 chand maheene baad hi chandrashekhar sarkaar par rajeev gandhi kii jasusi kaa aarope laga
 Congress withdrew support
 1991 ke chunaav ke bich main hi rajeev gandhi kii hatya ho gai
 The Congress got 244 seats
 party phir satta main ai or pivi narsimharav pradhanmantri bane
 Narasimharao was accused of buying and selling JMM mps to form and save the government
 vivaad ne tool pakadaa, lekin sarkaar ne apana kaarykaal puraa kiya
 The era of coalition governments had begun since the 90s
 bijepi ne 24 dalon ke saath neshnal democratic elliance yani endie banaakar 1998 se lekar 2004 tak raaj kiya
 In the 1999 elections, the Congress was reduced to just 114 seats
 yah sawaal bhi uthne laga tha ki congress gathbandhan sarkaar nahin chalaa sakati
 The Congress won 145 seats in the 2004 election
 congress unaited progressive elliance (upie) bana satta par kaabiz hui
 The government lasted for five years
 gauratlab he ki 2008 ke vaishvik aarthik sankat ke baavjood 2009 main congress 206 siton ke saath sabase badi party ke rup main ubhari
 When it came to forming a government, a leader like Janardan Dwivedi, one of the party's strategists, gave his opinion against forming a coalition government
 unka maananaa tha ki puure paanch saal tak gathbandhan sarkaar chalaakar congress ne gathbandhan raajnneeti main khud ko sabit kar diya he
 The Congress had sought a majority for itself based on its achievements of UPA One, which the voters did not give
 to jab party ko janadesh nahin mila he, to use vipaksh main baithna chahie
 The rationale behind this argument was that whatever mixed government would be formed without Congress, it would prove to be crippling and would be a guest of a few months or a few years
 uske girane ke baad phir chunaav honge, jisamen congress ko apni puri taaqat se ladanaa chahie
 He also cited the example of 1989, when despite having 197 seats, Rajiv Gandhi preferred to sit out of the government instead of claiming to form the government
 do saal baad 1991 main congress phir satta main laut ai
 (though sympathy stemming from Rajiv Gandhi's assassination was also a big reason), Dwivedi's argument was not heard and the UPA II government was formed
 congress ne upie van ke dauraan kai achche kaamon kii vajah se jo number paae, ve upie tu ke dauraan or khaastaur par aakiri do saal ke dauraan saamne aae ghapale, ghotaalon or mahangaai par kaabo nahin rakh paane kii vajah se ganvaa die
 Even after the bitter defeat of the Congress in the Delhi elections last December, a section of the party leaders was of the opinion that the people have neither given the mandate to form the government nor to form the government, but the Congress still supported the Aam Aadmi Party Giving Arvind Kejriwal permission to become Chief Minister
 kejariwal beshak 49 din main istifa de satta se bhaag gaye hon, lekin is dauraan congress kaa anubhav acha nahin rahaa
 He also had to listen to the hoax by forming a government
 2009 main centre or 2013, disambar main dilli main sarkaar banane or banavaane ke anubhav ke baad party ko lagane laga he ki janadesh se alag jaakar sarkaar banane yaa banavaane main apni bhoomika nibhaana nuksaandeh hi sabit hota he
 Rahul and his close friends feel that the Congress loses and will lose its own land by joining the game of forming a government despite not having the full numbers
 fracchard mandet milane kii sthiti main jo bhi party chaahe jod-tod kar sarkaar banaae, congress chupchaap apni baari kaa intazaar kare
 Meanwhile, the Congress should work to remove its organizational weaknesses
 upi-bihar jaise rajyon main party main jaan foonkane kii koshish ho
 The stability of a mixed government is not assured
 aise main jaise hi vah sarkaar gire, congress qamar kas kar taiyaar rahe chunavi kamyaabi ko hasil karne ke liye
 This will not compel him to run the government by bowing down to the alliance partners, nor will he have to spend his energy to help everyone
 rahul ke paas bhi vakt hoga ki vah jis tarah se party ko yuvaaon ke haath main saunpna chaahate hai, us disha main aage badhen
 According to a section of the party, all of them want to implement things like holding elections for all the posts, including from the lower level to the Congress Working Committee and even the General Secretary, President, Vice President in the party
 desh ke saamne ek nai congress party lekar aaen
 Therefore, sitting in the opposition will prepare the Congress for the future, against which there will be pressure to deliver on the parties who are in power and they will also make mistakes in order to run the government
 so wo wet and watch sahi ranneeti hogi

 Despite terming the withdrawal of the law as a farmer-friendly step, he reiterated that the previous step was also in the national interest
 yahi nahin, modi, ne badi khubsuurati se bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon kaa janjaal apane gale se utarkar rajyon kii taraf thel diya
 The Center wants states to enact laws on their own in the matter of taking land
 lekin, gend centre se rajya ke paale main jane kaa matlab kya he? kya ab kisaan ko apni jameen upie sarkaar ke 2013 ke kanoon ke hisaab se deni hogi yaa phir rajya jo kanoon banaaenge, uske hisaab se kisaan kii jameen jaaegi? yaa koi aisa rasta bhi he jo bahujan hitay vaala ho
 By the way, even before the answer to these questions came, the industrial world expressed its disappointment at this decision of Modi and gave an indication that the law of the Modi government was at least in his interest
 udhar, mukhya vipakshi dal congress ke netaa or upie sarkaar ke jameen kanoon ke sutaradhar jairam ramesh sadhi pratikriya dete hai, “satyamev jayate
 "but on the question whether the Congress is satisfied with this victory, Ramesh says," No, the Modi government willfully put the ball in the states' court
 aise main agar rajya manamaane kanoon banane lage to 2013 ke kanoon kii mul bhaavana khatre main pad jaaegi or kisaanon par phir se jameen se bedakhli kaa sankat khadaa ho jayega
 "that is, both the government and the opposition believe that the fight for land is going to come out of Delhi and reach the state capitals
 aise main india today ne kuch rajyon ke jameen lene ke model kaa adhyayan kiya jahaan sarkaar ko vikaas kaaryon ke liye bina kisi bade virodh ke jameen mil gai
 Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat seem to be at the forefront of such states, which have currently found ways to get land from farmers happily
 uttar pradesh kaa jameen kharid modelnawaabon ke shahar lakhanu main mayawati sarkaar ke jamaane main dalit netaaon ko garvile andaaj main pesh karne vaale samtamulak chairaahe se jaraa aage badhen to paryaton bhawan kii imaarat najar aati he
 Here in the office of Uttar Pradesh Industrial Expressway Development Authority (UPDA) on the first floor, a count down calendar is written in front of CEO Navneet Sehgal with 431 days left
 sahagal kehete hai, “expresve puraa karne main itane hi din bache hai
 In this calendar, one day decreases daily and road work increases in the same proportion
 ” darasal agra se lakhanu ko jodgaye vaala yah chah len expresve noida se agra tak aae 165 kimi lambey yamuna expresve kaa hi vistaar he
 But there is not much difference between the two expressways that one was built under the rule of Mayawati and the other is being built under the rule of Akhilesh Yadav
 asal fark yah he ki yamuna expresve jab bananaa tha tab uske liye hua jameen adhigrahan jabardast vivaadon main rahaa
 The farmers protested by putting their lives to death and the police opened fire
 2011 main to tatkaaleen centre sarkaar ke rajkumaar rahul gandhi khud iske virodh main dharne par baithe or kahin na kahin isi virodh se upie ke 2013 vaale bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon ko dhar mili
 The Mayawati government acquired a total of 6,600 hectares of land for the 165 km long expressway
 isamen se 2,500 hectare jameen real estate pariyojnaon ke liye thi
 At the same time, for the agra-lucknow Expressway almost double, the government is taking half of it i
e
 3,368 hectares of land
 is tarah dekha jaae to yamuna expresve kii tulana main agra-lakhanu expresve main prati kilometre sadak kii evaj main ek-chauthai jameen hi lee ja rahi he
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav says, "we don't have to impose development on the strength of the poles
" isiilie sarkaar ne jameen adhigrahan karne kii bajaae kisaanon se mahange daam par jameen kharidne kaa vyaavhaarik rasta nikaala
 “local officials of administration will buy land for UPDA
 jile ke dm maamle par sidhi najar rakhenge or sahagal khud dinabhar saare jilon kii report par najar rakhenge
 For the expressway, UPEDA has purchased land at 10 times the price prevailing in 10 districts
 kuch ek maamalon main jameen kaa adhigrahan bhi kiya gaya, lekin yahaan kharid se bhi zyada rate diya gaya
 So far, more than 27,000 farmers have sold their land to the government and there is no news of anyone going to court
 sahagal kehete hai, “samvaad se sab sambhav he, bas ek baar aap logon kaa bharosa jeet len
 All registries went online and the farmer was immediately transferred the money to his bank account
 ” 15,000 karod ru
 In the project, UPEDA on the purchase of land so far is Rs 3,000 crore
 kharch kar chukaa he
 This model of land purchase, rather than acquisition, seems to be successful at the moment
 andhra pradesh main land poolingudhar, dakshin main apni rajdhani hyderabad se bedakhal ho gaye andhra pradesh ko nae sire se rajdhani basaani he
 For this, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu decided to make a new capital in Guntur district itself, in the name of Amravati, which was the capital of Satavahana kings till the second century BC
 lekin yah koi mahabharat kaal to he nahin ki hastinapur se bedakhal kiye gaye dharmraj yudhisthir manachaahi jagah par indraprastha basaa len
 The new capital requires land and that too without any controversy
 isiilie naidu ne jameen adhigrahan jaise shabd se tauba kar lee, kyonki is shabd se hi log chidh jate hai
 Instead, work is being done through land pooling
 iske tahat jameen dene vaale ko awasaiya plot, commercial plot or har saal tay muaavja dene kaa praavdhaan he
 Under land pooling, the landowner is being given a residential plot of 1,000 square yards, a commercial plot of 300 square yards
 iske saath hi acinchit jameen par fasal ke nuksaan kii evaj main salanaa 30,000 ru
 And Rs 50,000 annually on irrigated land
 ek kism kii pension ke taur par die jaaenge
 This pension will also increase every year for 10 years at the rate of 10 percent
 khaas baat yah he ki yah suvidhaayen sirf ghar or jameen ke maalikon ko nahin balki kirayedaron or bhoomihin mazdooron ko bhi di jaani hai
 On the very first day, the way 540 farmers gave their 850 acres for land pooling, it shows how the scheme is being taken up
 rajasthan bhi raah parasambar 2013 main mukhyamantri banane ke baad vasundhara raaje ne pashchimi rajya rajasthan main nayaa bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon laane kii taiyaari kii
 Regarding the new law, Raje said, "our aim is to speed up the process of land acquisition, even if for this we have to pay more money to the landlord
 ” darasal, ve chaahati thim ki bhoomi adhigrahan main ausatan lagane vaale paanch saal ke samay ko kam kiya jaae
 In September 2014, it was decided to bring a bump in the compensation of land acquisition in the pass bill from Rajasthan cabinet
 iske tahat shahar main cirkil rate kaa doguna, shahar se paanch kimi se adhik duuri par do se saadhe chaar guna muaavja or usase adhik duuri par nau guna tak muaavja dene kii vyavastha kii gai
 Later this bill was sent to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly
 sarkaar isko lekar thodi dhili isliye pad gai thi ki pehle centre se bhoomi adhigrahan kii sthiti saaf ho jaae
 But now that Modi has put the ball back in the court of the states, along with many laws of land acquisition, this proposed law will also be noticed by the people

 NRDA chairman n Bagendra Kumar, who acquired 5,500 hectares of land in 27 villages, told India Today, “we gave farmers the option of giving land by mutual consent rather than the Land Acquisition Act of 1894
 ” nayaa raipur ke liye 2,700 hectare jameen isi tarah lee gai, jabaki 130 hectare jameen ke liye bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon kaa upyog kiya gaya
 6 to 12 lakhs per acre between 2006 and 2012 to farmers
 tak muaavja diya gaya
 Regarding the flexible way of acquiring land for this city, which was duly inaugurated in October 2012, Baijendra Kumar said, "the plot developed to farmers, in addition to compensation, is Rs 15,000
 prati acre prati varsh pension, muaavje kii rakam se anya jagah jameen kharidne par registration charge main baari chhot jaisi suvidhaayen di gayi
 "apart from this, facilities like skill development training for landowners and complete exemption in rent for two years on running a shop in Naya Raipur were added recently

 According to the report, the rate of land acquisition increased four-fold after the process began

 However, this plea of ahmed Patel was already rejected by Judge Bela Trivedi, while the counsel of BJP Balwant Singh Rajput argued that Ahmed Patel's plea is baseless, because he did not have any clear evidence about the disease anywhere
 No clear information is given
 iske baad court ne unhen 20 june ko court main hajir hone kaa aadesh diya tha
 Prior to Ahmed Patel, BJP President Jeetu Waghani, Minister of State for Home Pradeep Singh Jadeja, MLA Raghavji Patel have already recorded their statements before the court in this matter

 agar aapako pataa chale ki koi aapaki baatcheet sun rahaa he, smartphone kaa data kisi or ke paas ja rahaa he, soshal media par jo likh rahe hai us par suraksha agenciyaan nazar rakhti hai to kya aap sahaj rahenge
 Not only in India, the case of data privacy has become serious all over the world
 khaskar jab bhi yah maamla rashtriya suraksha ke naam par aata he tab yah masalaa or bhi gambhir ho jaataa he
 Keep in mind that the danger or issue of national security is not only to one country, but to all countries
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki rashtriya suraksha ke naam par aapaki zindagi main koi bhi taak-jhaank kar sake
 Refer your written talk, photos or conversation to someone else or someone else keeps listening
 bharat hi nahin puri duniya main yah sawaal bahut bada he
 In the name of national security and any other pretext that the government or company does not reach the data, the struggle of citizens is going on
 agar aapako lagata he ki isamen kya he to phir un logon se puuchhie ki aap 80 hazaar kaa smartphone rakhte hai lekin saath main do hazaar vaala purana jiesem phone kyon rakhte hai
 Those who have understood this thing have started finding options from social media to the use of phones
 ve bhi jo grih mantralay ke aadesh ke saath hai or ve bhi jo grahamantralay ke aadesh par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 What is the order? The order dated 20 December 2018 states that the following security and intelligence agencies using the powers of sub-section (1) of section 69 of the Information Technology Act 2002 and Rule 4 of the Information Technology Rules 2009, in any computer The material deposited or sent through it can intercept, monitor the information generated, encrypt their data or open it
 iske liye das agenciyaan adhikrut kii jaati hai jinke naam hai, intelligence beuro, narkotics control beuro, central board and diarect taxes, diarectorat of revenue intelligence, sibiai, neshnal invastigeshan agency, cabanit sachiv(ro), diarectorat of signal intelligence or kamishnar of police dilli
 Seeing the name of the Commissioner of Delhi Police, just thought how the Commissioner of Mumbai Police was left out
 kya rashtriya suraksha se sambandhit khatare main pune or mumbai ke kamishnar kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 But this is not so important
 par yah mahatvapurn he ki dilli hi kyon, yah bhi ki sibiditi kyon, sibiai kyon
 Whatever is in your computer, whatever is being sent from it and whatever was stored in it before it is erased, all of it can be acquired, monitored and intercepted
 rajyasabha main is baat ko lekar kaaphi bahes hui ki kya sarkaar ne sabhi agenciyon ko khuli chhot de di he
 If there was already a law, then why the Ministry of Home Affairs had to issue this notification on 20 December 2018
 hamaari sahyogi nita sharma ne enditivi dot com par likhaa he ki pehle grih mantralay logon ke phone kol or email scan kar saktaa tha
 The new order has given this authority to many more agencies
 jinke naam abhi abhi hamane bataae nita se ek purv naukarshah ne bataaya ki pehali baar data scan karne kaa adhikaar kai sari agenciyon ko diya gaya he
 The conversation that is going on before that is called data in motion can be intercepted
 magar is aadesh ke baad computer main jamaa, yaa usase bheji gai soochna ko bhi intercept karne kaa power de diya gaya he
 This is also a matter of technical
 agar sarkaar kisi khaas code se ek saath lakhon computer ko monitor karne lage to kya hoga, soshal media kii companiyaan aisi takanic ko lekar hameshaa vivaadon main rahati hai or duniya ke kai desh unki is badmaashi ko lekar kanoon bana rahe hai lekin jab sarkaar khud yahi kaam karti he to kya use rashtriya suraksha ke naam par karne diya ja saktaa he, yah sawaal sirf bharat kaa nahin he, america or japan or landan germany kaa bhi he
 The Intelligence Bureau does not yet have the authority to confiscate
 unhen rajya police ke saath milakar aisa karnaa padataa tha
 But everything has changed since this notification
 nita sharma ne likhaa he ki nae notification ke baad se sabsakribar, sarvice prowider yaa koi bhi vyakti jiske under wo computer he, use agenciyon ko sari jaankaree deni hogi
 Failure can result in jail for up to seven years
 kya yah computer zabt karne kaa aadesh bhar he yaa aapke ghar main rakhaa comptuyar ab phone kii tarah tap kiya ja sakegaa
 We have to understand at least three aspects in this case
 kanoonee, privesi or takniki
 Emails and phones have been tapped after the permission of the Home Secretary, but what has changed with computers being added to this list
 kyon mamata banerjee se lekar seetaram yechuri, ramgopal yadav se lekar anand sharma tak sabhi vipaksh ke netaa is aadesh ko lekar chintit hai or sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 See the effect, Modi ji's ears and eyes are now in the house
 har phone par hui baatcheet har phone par hui messej sun sakate hai
 If a mother is talking to her son, Modi is listening
 betaa pita se baat kar rahaa he, koi patrkaar modi sarkaar kii nitiyon par tippaniyon kar rahaa he to modi ji sun rahe hai
 If a farmer is saying on Modi ji's anti-farmer policies, then Modi ji can listen
 koi yuva google kar rahaa he to modi ji wo bhi sun sakate hai
 Modi's slogan in house to house came to power in 2014, now when power is going which has become the slogan, house to house spying
 di print main manish chhibbar ne likhaa he ki 22 disambar 2008 ko loksabhaa main bagaiyr kisi charchaa ke hi yah sanshodhan paas ho gaya tha
 Then there was the Congress government
 loksabhaa hi nahin jab rajya sabha main bahes hui tab ek bhi saansad ne iske khilaaf vot nahin kiya
 Under this amendment, for the first time, the Central Government was empowered to track any information deposited in computer, or transmitted by computer
 yah gambhir baat to he lekin us vakt privesi ko lekar waisi samaj nahin thi, jaisi aaj he
 Today, new risks of data surveillance have emerged due to technology in the world, their debate has become more complex and serious than ever before
 2008 ke sanshodhan ko lekar kai sansthaaon ne sawaal uthaae, kya tab kii sarkaar ne use suna tha
 Why not in the then law security measures were taken regarding privacy, and if it was not done then can it be said on the basis that it will not happen now

 Demonstration in the country against the Citizenship Amendment Act: The demand of the Akali Dal - to become a Muslim was also a part of the CAA in support of the bill in the Rajya Sabha - The Modi government, which is facing opposition from the opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act, has now got a challenge from its home
 punjab main bhartiya janata party kii saathi shiromani akali dal (SAD) kaa kahana he ki naagarikta sanshodhan act (CAA) main muslimon ko bhi shaamil kiya janaa chahie, hamaara desh secular he aise main sirf ek dharm ko baahar nikaalnaa sahi nahin he
 However, welcoming the law, Akali Dal spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said that the bill would help the oppressed minorities but it should also include people from the Muslim community
 party pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘hindu, sikh, buddha, jain, parsi, isai jinaki pakistan-afghanistan-bangladesh main pratadna hui, unhen ye bill bharat main jagah degaa ye bilkul sahi he
 But, another aspect of this is that Muslims are not involved in this
 hamaari party kaa saaf kahana he ki is kanoon main muslimon ko bhi jagah deni chahie, hamaara samvidhan secular he
 The constitution says that there should be no injustice to a person of any religion
 akali dal ne isi ke saath deshbhar main is kanoon ke virodh main ho rahi hinsa kaa virodh kiya
 Significantly, even though the Akali Dal is talking about including Muslims in this bill, the party supported this law in the Lok sabha-rajya Sabha
 aapako bataa den ki loksabhaa-rajyasabha main is bill kaa vipaksh ne virodh kiya tha or ise alpsankhyakon ke khilaaf bataaya tha
 Also, the opposition alleged that the bill also violates the Constitution
 haalanki, centre sarkaar ko is kanoon ko paas karaane main koi pareshaani nahin hui

 dilli kii rajyasabha siton par aam aadmi party dwaara ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa ke baad party ke tamaam netaa khamosh ho gaye hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has nominated its senior leader Sanjay Singh, well-known chartered accountant Narayan Gupta and noted businessman Sushil Gupta for 3 Rajya Sabha seats
 in teen naamon kii ghoshnaa se party ke duusare bade netaa or do saal serajyasabha jane kaasapana dekh rahe kavi kumaar vishwaas ke armaanon par pani phiraa he
 When the dreams were broken, sad Vishwas came in the media and attacked Kejriwal and said that he has been punished by the party for allegedly coming true on the surgical strike and JNU issue
 vishwaas ke bayaan par party ke kisi netaa ne kuch pratikriya nahin di
 Now the situation is that all the leaders of the party have sat down with their lips folded
 aakhir piesi kii baithak main kya hua?buudhvaar ko hui piesi kii baithak main kul 9 sadsy shaamil hue the
 In addition to two ex-officio members, the names of 3 Rajya Sabha candidates were discussed among 7 members
 piesi kii baithak main party ke netaa sanjay singh, chartered acountint narayan gupta or kaarobaari susheel gupta kaa naam rakhaa gaya
 All PAC leaders agreed in a tone in the name of Sanjay Singh
 vahiin chartered acountint narayan gupta ke naam par bhi kisi ne aapatti nahin jataai
 But as soon as Sushil Gupta was named in the meeting, there was uneasiness among many leaders present in the meeting
 haalanki party ke varisht netaa or khud rajyasabha ke liye daavedaar ashutosh ke alaava piesi kii baithak main shaamil kisi or sadsy ne susheel gupta yaa narayan gupta ke naam par aitraaj nahin kiya
 Sources reveal that only Ashutosh objected to Sushil Gupta's name and raised the question in the meeting on what basis he should be sent to Rajya Sabha
 ashutosh ke alaava piesi kii baithak main shaamil kisi netaa ne ek shabd bhi nahin kaha or bahumat se in 3 naamon par piesi ne muhar laga di
 What happened in the MLA meeting? After the AAP meeting of the AAP, all the party leaders reached Kejriwal's house when all the party mlas were called to discuss
 netaaon ne vidhayakon ke saamne in 3 naamon kaa elaan kiya
 While there was joy in the mlas in the name of Sanjay Singh, there was silence in the crowd of more than 55 mlas present in the meeting in the name of Narayan Gupta and Sushil Gupta
 sutara bataate hai ki vidhayakon ke chehre par naaraazgi or asahajata saaf dikhaai dene ke baavjood bhi kisi vidhayak ne alaakaman se in donon naamon par sawaal poochne kii himmat nahin dikhaai
 All the mlas of the party came out at the end of the meeting after taking the orders of the high command in the name of the future Rajya Sabha mps of the party and kept silence in front of the media cameras
 kya vidhayakon se mili the susheel gupta?aam aadmi party ke andruni sutara bataate hai ki teen chaar din pehle kaarobaari susheel gupta ne dilli main ek party di thi jahaan aam aadmi party ke kuch vidhayak shaamil hue the
 According to sources, the invitation was given to all the mlas but only 5 to 7 Aam Aadmi Party mlas went to participate in Sushil Gupta's party
 dilachasp tareeke se teen-chaar din pehle hi party kii chandani chowk se vidhayak alka lamba ne soshal media par ek twit kiya tha jisamen likhaa tha 'susheel'
 Why is there silence in the Aam Aadmi Party? There have been many times when the Aam Aadmi Party has been involved in some controversy and there are difficulties in front of the leaders, but late in the morning, the leaders of the party will come out strongly to differentiate those disputed decisions
 Appeared yah pehali baar hua he ki jab party ne kuch netaaon ko tikat thamaya or party ke duusare bade netaa is faisle ke bare main nahin bol paa rahe hai
 On behalf of the Aam Aadmi Party, Saurabh Bhardwaj and Atishi Marlena have been given the responsibility to come to the media and defend the party's decision
 lekin chehre se udi raunak or baton main hilta hua avishvaas saaf jataa rahaa he ki kejariwal ke is faisle se party ke netaaon main na to sahmati he or naa hi khushi
 Many of the party's mlas appeared clumsy when asked if they knew the names
 soshal media par sakriy aam aadmi party ke kai kaaryakarta bhi is faisle se na sirf chakit hai balki niraash bhi hai
 However, since Thursday morning many party leaders and their activists have been seen standing in defense of Kejriwal's decision
 kai kaaryakartaaon ne soshal media par yah bhi likhaa he ki har baraam aadmi partyper paise lekar tikat bechney kaa aarope lagata he lekin aaj tak ek saboot saamne nahin aayaa
 Some leaders also say that when the BJP gives tickets to people from other party, does the media ask them questions too? Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party has started praising their greatness by releasing bio data of their three Rajya Sabha candidates on social media
 in tamaam ghatnakram ke baad bhi ek chiz jo saaf he ki rajyasabha keummidavaaron main sanjay singhke alaava baaki ke 2 naam par naa to party kaa koi netaa puure confidence or vishwaas ke saath kuch kah paa rahaa he or naa hi samarthak in naamon ko pachaa paa rahe hai
 The leader of the suppressed tongue party believes that corruption may not have happened but the loss of perception has been very difficult in the days to come

 Shah had said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement on Independence Day about creation of the post of Chief of Defense Staff (CDS) would strengthen the country's defense manifold
 shah ne haryana vidhansabha chunaav se pehle jat samudaay ke garh jind main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue sthaneey diggaj netaa birendra singh kaa udhaaharan diya jo paanch saal pehle congress chhodkar party main aaye the or aisa karke vah dusron ko iske liye prerit karte prathit hue

 There is no barrier now
 ' shah ne kaha tha ki kashmir se kanyakumari tak ‘maa bharti' aaj prasann hai ki modi ne anuchhed 370 ke adhiktar praavdhaanon ko hataa diya he
 'he said that we have been saying that Kashmir is an integral part of India but Article 370 used to give some message that something is still incomplete
 ' unhone is kaam ko modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal main abhi tak kiya gaya ‘‘sabase bada kaam'' bataaya
 He had said that Article 370 was somehow preventing Kashmir from joining with India
 'unhone kaha tha ki jind kii raily se main desh ko bataanaa chahta hum ki anuchhed 370 ke adhiktar praavdhaanon ko hathaaye jane ke baad jammu kashmir, leh or ladakh ke vikaas main jo koi bhi baadha thi, use ab hataa diya gaya he
 Shah said that due to Modi ji, Articles 370 and 35A are now part of history
 jo modi ne kiya vah koi sarkaar soch bhi nahin sakati thi, agar vah kai varshon tak satta main bani rahati tab bhi, is kadam ko uthaane ke bare main nahin soch sakati thi
 The Home Minister also criticized the previous governments for not creating the post of Chief of Defense Staff which was recommended after the Kargil War of 1999

 Will ensure synergy between Army, Navy and Air Force

 Shah also praised Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar for running a 'corruption-free' government in Haryana
 unhone kaha tha ki main yahaan khatter ko badhai dene ke liye aayaa hum
 He said that the state was notorious for 'land deals' and recruitment in government jobs had turned into a 'trade'
 shah ne kaha, "ek kaarykaal main khatter ne bhrashtachar ko 'bhootkaal' bana diya
 " council for indian fahrren policy (bhartiya videsh niti parishad) ne pakistani raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari se anurodh kiya he ki vah niyantran rekha par jari tanaav kam karne main apni bhoomika nibhaaen

 Former Union Minister and Congress leader Rajiv Shukla said on Thursday that India underwent 6 surgical strikes in the UPA regime and 2 in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki bharat ne kis taarikh ko 'sargical strike' kii thim
 In a press conference, Shukla said, "we never had a chest
" lekin jis shaks ne sirf ek sargical strike kii, vah apni peeth thapthapa rahaa he
 The Congress leader said, neither former PM Manmohan Singh nor Atal Bihari Vajpayee ever held a press conference about it
 atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar 1999 se 2004 tak rahi
 The UPA government ruled the country from 2004 to 2014
 Rajiv Shukla, Congress: 6 surgical strikes were conducted during Manmohan Singh govt
 One was conducted on June 19, 2008 in Bhattal Sector in j & K's Poonch, one from Aug 30-september 1, 2011 in Sharda Sector across Neelam River Valley in Kel (1 / 2) pic

 party ke rashtriya pravaktaa jivielen raav ne congress or party chif rahul gandhi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, congress party kaa jhooth sach nahin ho saktaa
 Rahul Gandhi is apologizing in the Supreme Court for the lie
 aise jhooth bolkar congress janata ko gumraah nahin kar sakati
 Rao said, the Army was willing to cross the loc even during the Congress tenure and carry out surgical strikes in Pakistan
 lekin sarkaar main yah kadam uthaane kii himmat nahin thi
 The reason for the rage between BJP and Congress: The issue of surgical strike was rekindled after the Indian Air Force air strike in Balakot on 26 February this year between the Congress and the ruling BJP government
 2016 main hue uri aatanki hamale ke baad bhartiya sena ne press conference kar bataaya tha ki para commandos ne pioke main ghuskar aatankiyon ke launch pads tabah kar die hai

 The BJP had strengthened its hold in the region with its formation
 lekin baad main congress ne apni jade jamaane main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Both the parties are standing on par with winning the election five times

 Sanjay Dutt started his political innings
 munnabhai ne kaha ki gandhigiri hi unka chunavi mudda hoga or congress se maayoos hone ke baad hi wo samaajawaadee party se jude he
 Sanjay Dutt also made it clear that if Atal Bihari Vajpayee contested from Lucknow, he would leave the field
 sanjay dutt ne kaha ki main bhaashan nahin duga, main apane dil kii baat karuunga
 If the cinematographer will enter politics, then the talk will start in a film style
 atal ji ke liye maan sammaan dikhaakar sanju baba kai sawaalon ko saaf kar gayi
 But the biggest question that stands before him in contesting elections is that Munna Bhai has mentioned in a very light tone
 pita ke armaanon kaa hawala diya or kahin naa kahin logon ke dil ko chune kii koshish kii
 Sanjay said that he is not a terrorist
 unhone kaha ki mere pita ji bade khush hote jab unhen pataa lagata ki unka betaa antkavaadi nahin he or tada mujh par se hat chukaa he
 Sanjay Dutt said to the Congress that after the passing of father i felt that a very big party is with me but still i felt lonely
 munna bhai dil kii kah gayi ab dil kii thi yaa bade bhai amar singh ji kii ye sanju baba hi behatar bataaenge lekin baat khatm hui to amar singh ne munnabhai ke circuit ko bhi siyaasi bana diya
 Gujarat election is on the head and all the parties have removed all the political arrows from their quiver
 ek taraf modi kaa gujarat duusari ore 22 saal kaa banavaas khatm karne kii koshish main congress
 But this time the scene has changed a lot
 khaskar congress ke liye
 Modi is not in Gujarat and is now ruling the country, Congress is looking at Gujarat as a semi-final for 2019
 aise main morcha sambhala congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne
 The election of Gujarat is being held at a time when the 2019 election is close, Rahul Gandhi is to be crowned as the Congress President and the Modi government is in the dock with many issues including employment-economy
 rahul gandhi ne gujarat ko apana launch pad banaaya or utar pade maidan main
 Rahul Gandhi has so far done 4 Navsarjan Yatras in Gujarat
 theth gujarati andaaj, mandiron ke darshan, dhabas pe khaanaa, chaay kii dukaanon par charchaa, kamgaaron ke saath mulaakaaten, bade-bujurgon, kisaanon ke saath samvaad to yuvaaon ke saath selfi ye kuch rahul gandhi ke badale hue andaaj najar aate hai gujarat main
 Broadly speaking, Rahul Gandhi did four types of experiments before taking charge of the Congress and made Gujarat a test ground for this: 1
 jaateey card par daanvgujrat main rahul gandhi ke modi ke us trump card kii kaat khoji jisane 2014 ke chunaavon main congress ko kamobesh haashie par laakar khadaa kar diya
 That is, the answer of the Hindu card is from the ethnic card
 bijepi ke liye sabase mushkil baat yah he ki jatigat raajnneeti use raas nahin aati he
 Bihar Assembly elections are an example of this
 argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav ne bihar vidhansabha chunaav ko jati ke ird-gird simtaakar bijepi ko dharashayi kar diya tha
 This is the reason why Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has played the ethnic card to win the political battle of Gujarat on the lines of Bihar
 rahul gandhi ne gujarat main patidaar, obisi, or dalit va adivasee maton ko saadhane kii jugat kii he
 If you look at the views of these three societies, there is a share of above 70 percent
 isi ke maddenjar rahul ne gujarat main jati andolan se nikle trimurti alpesh, jignesh or hardik ko saath aane kaa nyauta diya tha
 Rahul's attempt was also successful
 alpesh ne congress jwine kar liya to vahiin jignesh or hardik ne samarthan kaa elaan kar diya he
 The Congress' ethnic card has increased uneasiness in the BJP
 narendra modi ko gujarat main kahana padaa ki jatvaad ke bahekaave main naa aae, jatigat muddon se desh ke vikaas main rukaawat aegi
 2
 anti hindu vaali chhavi ko todagujrat se rahul gandhi bijepi dwaara congress party par lagaae gaye 'hindu virdohi' or 'alpsankhyakon ke tushtikaran' jaise aaropon kaa bhi jawaab dene kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 In fact, one of the major reasons for the defeat of the Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was that the Antony Committee considered anti-hindu image
 rahul ne gujarat yatra ke jariye congress kii hindu virdohi chhavi ko todane kii kavayad kii he
 Rahul Gandhi started the Navsajran Yatra with worship at the Dwarkadhish temple in Saurashtra
 gujarat main rahul gandhi soft hindutv kii raah par hai
 Sant Mahanta appears on stage with Rahul in rallies in Muslim-dominated areas
 rahul kaa kafila aage nikalataa he to raste main padane vaali kisi masjid par na wo rukate hai or nahi maathaa tekte hai
 While there, Rahul applied tilak on his forehead during his four visits in Gujarat and passed by visiting the temples on the way and bowing his head
 rahul ne gujarat ke sabhi pramukh mandiron main jaakar darshan kiya he
 Rahul's Twitter account is replete with photos of him visiting temples
 rahul gujarat main mahabharat kaa paath bhi padhaate hai kehete hai pandavon kii taraf se bhagwaan krishna duryodhana se milane gaye or sirf 5 gaanv maange
 Duryodhana replied that even the tip of the needle would not give the ground equal
 tab bhi satya or asaty kii ladaai thi aaj bhi ladaai satya or asaty kii he
 The BJP is restless due to Rahul's foreheads in temples and is also questioning his visit to temples
 rahul iske jawaab main kehete hai ve shivbhakt hai
 3
 pipal conectagujarat main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi nae tevar or nae andaaj main najar aae
 Rahul tried to communicate directly with the public during his visit to Gujarat
 rahul har sawaal, aarope or apni baat par wo janata se hami bharwate najar aae
 Rahul's rallies are gathering more crowd than before
 rahul jab adivaasiyon kii samasya kii baat karte hai to manch par bhaashan dene ke liye bulaate hai ek adivasee noujvaan ko
 If he does not know Hindi, Rahul says, "you speak, i will understand and translate with someone else and support you
" rahul logon ke bich jate hai selfi khinchvaate hai
 All of them are old men but they take special care of the children, but the important thing is what is the tradition in the area
 Under the tradition, they stand among the peacock feathers of the tribals and try to get familiar with them
 rahul din kaa siyaasi prachaar khatm karne ke baad rahul noujvaan ke andaaz main apni neeli tishart pahanakar kisi kshetra ke dhabas par pahunchate hai or gujarati khaanaa kaa swaad lete hai
 4
 2019 kaa agenta set kiyarahul gandhi ne gujarat ke siyaasi jameen se 2019 kaa agenda set kar liya he
 The issues that Rahul is raising in Gujarat will also be useful for him in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 rahul gujarat main vyapaariyon se lekar naujavaanon, kisaanon tak se mulaakaat or baatcheet kar rahe hai or unke hit ko lekar sidhe modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi has made unemployment the biggest issue during the Navsarjan Yatra in Gujarat
 jiesti par modi sarkaar ko gheraa, to sarkaar ko jiesti kii daron main katautee kerani padi
 Rahul is also describing the condition of the farmers
 gujarat main kisaan aatmahatya ke maamle main 9wein sthaan par he
 Today the condition of farmers in the country is quite pathetic
 rahul ke in muddon par bijepi ko jawaab dete nahin ban rahaa he
 This is the reason BJP is now trying to find a cut of Rahul's strategy and is ready to field more than 10 Union ministers including Prime Minister Modi in Gujarat election campaign
 dilli samet uttar bharat ke tamaam ilaakon main is baar kadakadaati sardi nahin pad rahi he
 Talking about this time, December is going to end and January is going to start but the thick fog is completely missing from the whole area
 puraa uttar bharat rahegaa kam thandamausam kii is ajab paheli kaa haal ye he ki himachal, uttarakhand, punjab, dilli, pashchimi uttar pradesh, saurashtra, kuccha or rajasthan ke tamaam ilaakon main taapmaana saamaanya ke mukaable 2 se 5 degree celsius upar record kiye ja rahe hai
 Talking about the capital Delhi, the minimum temperature has been recorded at 5 degree Celsius above normal
 mausam vibhaag kaa anumaan he ki rajdhani dilli main janvari kii shuruyaat tak mausam main koi khaas badlaav nahin dekha jayega
 That is, there is no possibility of a mercury drop in Delhi and the surrounding areas, and sunshine will remain in the day, this view of open sun will remain in all the plains of ganga-yamuna
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki is baar monsoon kii barish uttar bharat main kam rahi thi or saath hi uske baad in ilaakon main is baar barish bhi na ke baraabar hui he lihaaja mitti main nami kii baari kami he
 In such a situation, fog is missing in most places in the plains due to the possibility of a drop in temperature
 yani sardi ke maheenon main khili dhoop or chadhe hue taapmaana ke bich nayaa saal dastak dene ja rahaa he
 In the winter months, this time it is not getting as cold as it usually is
 iske peeche sabase badi vajah bataai ja rahi he baar-baar aa rahe kamjor western disterbence
 Weak western disturbances provide snowfall only in high altitude areas of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal
 lihaaja maidani ilaaka puri tarah se inaki thand se achoota rah jaataa he
 The temperature in the plains goes up due to these weak western disturbances instead of cold winds
 31 disambar ko aisa hi ek kamjor western disturbance kashmir main dastak dene ja rahaa he
 Due to this, there is a possibility of light snowfall in high altitude areas in Kashmir on 31 December and 1 January
 lekin western disterbence kamjor rahane kii vajah se nae saal par uttar bharat main zyaadaatar jagahon par dhoop khili rahegi

 haalanki, isse pehle khud mamata banerjee kai baar manch se is baat kii ghoshnaa karti raheen ki tejasvi abhi nahin aaen hai magar vah jarur aaenge
 But right away, Tejashwi Yadav arrived at the rally and when he got a chance to speak on stage, he took on Modi government and PM Modi
 saath hi unhone tiemasi kii raily main der se aane kii vajah bhi logon se kahi
 Tejaswi greeted the people as soon as she came from the stage and gave the reason for the late arrival
 mamata kii raily main der se pahunche tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki ''hamako aane main isliye deree ho gai kyonki hamaare upar modi or amit shah ji kii krupa thi
 Because of them, we were late in coming, if you compromise with them, you join hands with them, then you will be counted in King Harishchandra, but if you ask them questions and count their promises, you will fight, you will work to join the country

 congress karnataka main bijepi ko rokane ke liye apane se aadhi seat paane vaali jedies ko samarthan dene or iske netaa kumaraswami ko siem banane ko taiyaar ho gai he
 However, this decision was not easy, for this the role of two women was very important
 mangalvaar ko rujhaan aane ke baad se hi congress ke diggajon ke yahaan chahal-pahal kaaphi bad gai
 According to DNA newspaper, a new twist in the story came at a meeting held at 10 Janpath, the official residence of Sonia Gandhi
 rujhaan aane ke baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi, priyanka gandhi wadra tatkaal sonia gandhi ke awaas pahunche
 Who suggested Kumaraswamy to offer CM post! The newspaper quoted sources as saying that it was Priyanka Gandhi's suggestion that Rahul Gandhi offer JDS leader Kumaraswamy as Chief Minister
 yah prastaav pesh karnaa aasaan nahin tha, kyonki jedies ke paas congress ke mukaable aadhi siten hi hai
 The leaders present in this meeting had a grudge about how HD Deve Gowda would answer if Rahul Gandhi would call for an alliance
 asal main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan rahul gandhi ne baar-baar jedies ke saath kisi gathjod se inkaar kiya tha or kai baar apane bhaashanon main unhone jedies ko bijepi kii bi team bhi bataaya tha
 Sonia Gandhi first spoke to Ghulam Nabi Azad, who sent her communication sources to Devgowda and Kumaraswamy
 gulam nabi aaazaad kii taraf se sakaaratmak sandesh milane ke baad sonia gandhi ne khud devgauda or kumaraswami se baat kii
 Sonia took the precaution that she spoke to JDS leaders instead of Rahul Gandhi herself, as Deve Gowda is a senior leader and perhaps Rahul Gandhi's talks would not have affected him
 congress ne pehle yah kaha tha ki yadi karnataka main 100 se zyada siten ain to vah apane dam par sarkaar banaaegi or yadi siten isse kam ain to duusare vikalpon par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In this way, after Sonia Gandhi's call, the ball went to Devgowda's court
 iske baadabengalooru main,jahaan teji se ghatnakram badal rahaa tha, congress ne yah ghoshnaa kar di ki vah jedies ke saath sarkaar banane or kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri banane ke liye taiyaar he
 Sonia will be active again! The way Sonia Gandhi herself called to convince the JDS in Karnataka, the experts are also assessing that Sonia Gandhi will have to be active again
 uski vajah yahi he ki rahul gandhi kaa kad abhi is tarah kaa nahin ho paaya he ki vah vipaksh kekaddavar netaonse baat kar saken or vipaksh ke netaa bhi unhen abhi apane baraabar maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Sonia is also now ready to indicate that the Congress is ready to become a junior partner to defeat the BJP

 When reporters questioned the regional MLA and the state government's revenue minister Umashankar Gupta for not having toilets in Kamal's house, he turned the media on the contrary to see inferior things

 Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Council secretary Nina Srivastava told pti-language that documents of about 50,000 students were found to be fake in the investigation

 jab ham jalwaayu parivartan kii baat karte hai, back tu basic kii baat karte hai tab main vishesh rup se kahana chaahunga-yoga hamaari puraatan paaramparik amuly dein he
 Yoga is not just an exercise, but a means of identification with oneself, the world and nature
 iske jariye jivan style main badlaav laakar ham jalwaayu parivartan se ladane main madadgaar banenge
 "prime Minister Narendra Modi made an appeal to the United Nations General Assembly on September 27 last year to extend yoga as an international day, when the Ministry of AYUSH (nodal body) had no idea that people would be so enthusiastic about it
 21 june ke antarrashtriya aayojan ke liye aayush mantralay ne pehle 35,000 or baad main do hajaar tii-shart or yoga mat banawaye the, lekin maang itani aa gai ki use itane kam samay main puraa kar paanaa sambhav nahin tha
 Joint Secretary Anil Ganeriwala, who is overseeing the Yoga Day celebrations in the ministry, told India Today, “2-3 months ago we had not thought that the enthusiasm of the people to participate in the event would be so great
 ” sarkaar ne is aayojan ko safal banane ke liye puri takat jhonk di
 One lakh per NGO Rs
 kii raashi di gai
 Director of Central Yoga and Naturopathy Research Council, Dr
 ishwar en
 Acharya states that one lakh given to ngos was Rs
 kii raashi agle saal bhi jari rahegi
 The Council alone organized 6 on the International Yoga Day
 5 karod ru
 If spent, according to Union Ayush Minister Shripad Yesso Naik, the total expenditure of the entire event is 25 to 30 crores

 Even after the religious controversy over yoga, the increased trends have given a new flight to the government's expectations
 saanskrithik morche par yoga ko duniya bhar main badi pahchaan dilaakar sangh parivaar kaa dil jeetne vaale pradhanmantri modi ab yoga ko ek udyog kaa bhi rup dene kii yojana par kaam karte dikh rahe hai
 The Modi government, which is making Make in India a success in the first International Yoga Day, has not done much homework yet, but its strategy is to make Yoga as an industry
 antarrashtriya manyata ke baad yoga se jude vishvavidhyalay, college, yoga prashikshak, yoga ke liye jaruri saamaan mat-dress aadi kii maang baduya lajimi he
 Says Ganeriwala, “with the renewed focus of yoga, the responsibility of the Ministry of AYUSH will also increase
 jaise america main yoga kii alag industry ban chuki he, waisi hi industry kii sambhaavna ab bharat main bhi dikh rahi he
 "according to an estimate, the yoga industry in the US has been worth about $ 27 billion, while yoga has its roots in India
 ayurvedic or anya vaikalpik dawaaiyon ke niryaat ke maamle main bharat doosraa bada desh he
 This will definitely increase this business and India will also have to prepare in this way

 Says Acharya, “yoga has never developed as an industry in India and after the recognition of Yoga Day, instead of industry, i think trained and skilled man power will grow, as well as create employment opportunities
 ” parishad yoga ke liye 6 kendriya santhaan sthapit kar rahi he

 Also, at least 100 beds will be prepared in order to recruit patients in every institution
 parishad kii koshish in sansthaanon ko antarrashtriya sansthaaon ke saath jodgaye kii bhi he
 Despite the controversy, there will be a lot of political rhetoric about rugs on Sarkar Yoga Day
 lekin sarkaar kisi tarah ke vivaad main funskar apane agenda ko kamjor karnaa nahin chaahati
 The Sangh Parivar is happy with Modi with Yoga being recognized as International Day with tremendous support from 177 countries
 vishwa hindu parishad ke antarrashtriya mahasachiv chanpat raay kii daleel he, “yoga kaa kya arth he, ise mahaj kuch dinon main modi ne duniya ko bataa diya
 “now the government is moving towards making yoga a part of the school curriculum
 nik kehete hai, “hamaari manshaa yoga ko paathyakram main shaamil karne kii he
 We have to do this, but will take the final decision as recommended by the committee
 ” lekin sutron ke mutabik paathyakram main shaamil karne se pehle sarkaar kii manshaa shaareerik shiksha (piti) main yoga ko anivaary karnaa he
 For this, the Ministry of AYUSH has written a letter to the Ministry of Human Resource Development
 saath hi sena, police, ardh sainik balon main bhi yoga ko shaamil karne kii disha main sarkaar kaam kar rahi he
 It is evident that the Modi government has stepped forward on the double agenda through yoga
 uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party sarkaar ke dream project gomti river front ghotaale kii jaanch sibiai ne shuru kar di he
 In August last, Principal Secretary Home Uttar Pradesh wrote a letter to the CBI in which eight engineers of the irrigation department were accused
 baad main gomti nagar thane main inke khilaaf report bhi darj hui thi
 According to the complaint of the case, during the SP government, a plan for development along the banks of the Gomti River was launched in which Rs 1513 crore was spent
 is kharche main gadabadi kii shikaayatein mili thi lekin tatkaaleensapa sarkaar ne koi karrwai nahin kithi
 When the government changed in March, the investigation was started in this case, later the investigation was handed over to the CBI
 sibiai ne ab is maamle main mukadmaa darj kar liya he or jaanch shuru kar di he
 According to the allegations, in the project costing Rs 1513 crore, Rs 1437 crore (95%) was already released without working
 shikayaton ke baavjood puraa kaam nahin hua, jiske baad jaanch shuru hui aaropon ke mutabik pariyojna main mili raashi main ghotaalaa karne main adhikariyon ne or ejiniyaron ne jamkar khel kiya

 On Wednesday, liquor businessman Vijay Mallyane said that he had met Arun Jaitley before leaving India

 He writes long blogs, but does not write anything about it
 arun jetali mulaakaat ke bare main jhooth bol rahe hai
 During this, he spoke to fellow leader PL Punia that he had seen both of them talking
 rahul ne kaha ki hamaare paas saboot he
 PL Punia said that Arun Jaitley and Vijay Mallya were talking on March 1, the next day after the budget was presented
 vah kareeb 15-20 minute tak baat karte rahe, pehle donon khadey hokar baat kar rahe the or uske baad donon vahiin central haul main baithkar baat karne lage
 When i read after two days that Mallya had left, i was surprised
 unhone kaha ki ham chaahate hai ki sansad kii sisitivi footage kii jaanch honi chahie iske sari sachai saamne aa jaaegi
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that a number of questions arise that the Finance Minister talks to a fugitive, and the fugitive tells him that he is leaving the country
 lekin vitt mantri ne naa police ko bataaya, naa sibiai ko bataaya
 After this the lookout notice was also relaxed
 jetali ko sach bolnaa chahie or bataanaa chahie ki iske liye wo jimmedaar hai, yaa phir unhen upar se order aa rahe hai
 Rahul said that the Finance Minister should resign immediately
 congress adhyaksh ne aarope lagaaya ki lukout notice ko sirf vitt mantri or pradhanmantri hi badalawa sakate hai
 The Finance Minister let Vijay Mallya escape
 pehle kiya tha twit se warabuudhvaar ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne maalya ke bayaan ke baad vitt mantri arun jetali kaa istipha maanga tha
 He tweeted that the allegations made by Mallya are very serious and the PM should immediately investigate the matter objectively
 rahul ne kaha ki jaanch puri hone tak arun jetali ko vitt mantri ke pad se istipha dena chahie
 Given Vijay Mallya's extremely serious allegations in London today, the PM should immediately order an independent investigation into the matter
 Arun Jaitley should step down as finance Minister while this probe is underway
 - Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi) September 12, 2018 Mallya gave this statement
 
 
 vijay maalya ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki vah bharat se ravaanaa hone se pehle vitt mantri se mila tha
 Mallya, who arrived in London to appear in Westminster Magistrate's court, said he had met the minister and offered to settle the case with the banks
 arun jetali ne di thi safai
 
 
 Arun Jaitley while clarifying in this regard on Facebook said, 'mallya's claim is factually incorrect
 maine 2014 se ab tak unhen milane kaa time nahin diya
 He was a Rajya Sabha member and sometimes came to the House
 main sadan se nikalakar apane kamare main ja rahaa tha, isi dauraan vah saath ho liye
 He offered an agreement, to which i stopped him and said that there is no use in talking with me, make this proposal with the banks
