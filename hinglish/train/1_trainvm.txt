 If they wish, then change the plot for a short time

 tabhi to tamaam filmon main hamaare nayak hira laane kaa kitna jokhim uthaate rahe hai
 They never steal a diamond at the beginning of the film
 pehle puri film main practice karte hai phir jaakar last seen main churaate hai
 Heera and Clamax have a birth-to-date relationship
 dhooma-2 main to apana ruthik roshan plaster aaf paris kii murti ban gaya
 He stood with them in a diamond safe
 mujhe to lagata he ki aajkal hira chori kaa jo set banataa he wo kisi badi building main lift vaala aria hota he jahaan kai darvaaze ek saath khulte or band hote rahete hai
 Fraudulently, the film people show how safe the diamond is
 kitne darvaaze hai
 In Prince, Vivek Oberoi does not know which cloth he wears which suffers 440 volts of current

 It is said that there are two types of people in the world
 ek vinar or ek luzar
 It was a new item in the ever-dividing market of the rich and the poor, which changed the whole discourse

 King Khan says that life gives every loser an opportunity to become a winner
 kasam se unke is samvaad ne mujhe pehle qaayal kiya phir ghayal kar diya tha
 Kohinoor will come
 zindagi hamen ek mauka degi use laane kaa
 With this hope, i returned home from the cinema
 aurangzeb ke naam se ham road tak bardaasht nahin kar sakate lekin babar ke haath se sparsh hue kohinoor ke liye itane betaab ho sakate hai, samaj nahin aayaa
 What is less, the fools have not yet declared those people as traitors in the name of nationalism, who gave the eyes of Noor Kohinoor to the British as a gift
 kohinoor ham hindustaniyon ko luzar se vinar banane ke mauqe kaa naam he
 In the name of bringing it, village-by-street, the garbage of history continues to spread the wonders of wonder
 jaise hi pataa chalaa ki november 2015 main pradhanmantri narendra modi landan jane vaale hai hindi channelon ne kohinoor heere ko lekar hangaamaa khadaa kar diya
 Public dream was created about Kohinoor that this is the diamond
 gaur se dekho, ankhen fadkar dekho
 Modi ji is about to come
 channelon ne ek chaalaaki kii
 Whenever written, with the questioning symbol written, Modi can ask the Queen for Kohinoor? Will Modi demand Kohinoor diamond during lunch with Queen? Clipping of these channels on youtube shows that a significant propaganda has been created
 unki baton se aisa laga jaise piem modi lunch ke dauraan yah kehane vaale hon ki madam wo jo hira rakhaa he aapke bagal main, agar mil jaataa to
 
 
 Not me, our country channels are asking
 
 
 agar
 
 
 No problem otherwise
 
 
 
 
 ‘aisa pataa chalaa he’ ke aadhaar par koob khabaren chali
 No one has revealed to whom it is revealed
 aisa pataa chalaa he jaise jangal-jangal baat chali he pataa chalaa he
 It makes me sound like this
 udhar se uttar pradesh se aazam khan bayaan dene lage ki pradhanmantri kohinoor to laayen hi saath main landan se tipu sultan kii wo anguthi bhi lete aaen jis par ram likhaa he
 Something would have taken care of the status of Azam Saheb too
 johari kii dukaan main nahin gaye the hamaare piem ki heere ke saath ek anguthi bhi maang lete
 No one knows if there was a demand for diamonds
 tippaniyan There are some blanks of Indian nationalism which our politics keeps frustrating in the hope that we will be filled sometime
 jab tak nahin bharenge hamaara rashtrawaad puraa nahin hoga
 From the Parliament to the road, Kohinoor has also been presented as a vacant place to be filled from London
 magar hai
 What did the government do? koi lut kar nahin le gaya to yahi kah dete ki chori kar le gaya tha
 It was also a matter of saying that we have given gifts
 kohinoor ko lekar sara excitement hi khatm kar diya modi sarkaar ne
 When Modi was on a visit to London, the British Prime Minister told NDTV that we will not give Kohinoor
 aise to hamaare musium hi khaali ho jaaenge
 Talk to the same thing, Solicitor General of India Ranjit Kumar has said in the Supreme Court that if we do this then our museum will be empty
 jaao o duniya waalon, hamane musium kii khaatir mulk kaa sapana qurbaan kar diya
 But the Supreme Court still has the last hope, so the court did not dismiss the case so that if someone makes a claim in future, it will not be difficult that your court has rejected it
 yani supreme court ne us sapane ko zindaa rakhaa he
 Varna Kohinoor is not stolen, this truth is nothing short of a shock
 kohinoor ko lekar tamaam jhooth or myth kii chamak feeki kar di thi sarkaar ke vakil ne
 As long as this appeal is pending in the Supreme Court, our star man artists can continue the practice of diamond theft in the film scene
 balki ve chahen to thode samay ke liye ab plat badal len
 They should not steal the diamond
 tohfe main diya karen taaki kohinoor hamaari rashtriya granthi yani complex se azaad ho sake
 It seems that we can also give a diamond as a gift
 wo hira jo hira he sadaa ke liye
 For Queen Victoria
 hira kii tamanna he ki panna mujhe mil jaae
 Whether i know my life or my heart
 yahi gaaiye taaki kuch to raahat pahunche
 In Happy New Year, Shah Rukh Khan divides the people of the world into two parts
 kehete hai duniya main do tarah ke log hote hai
 One winner and one loser
 ye amir or garib ke sanathan bantwaare ke market main nayaa item tha jisane puure vimarsh ko hi badal diya
 But not all people go to London to steal a diamond
 mere khyaal se pehle dubai main practice karnaa chaahate honge ki yahaan se ham chura sakate hai yaa nahin
 Later we will think Kohinoor
 king khan kehete hai ki zindagi har luzar ko ek mauqaa detii he taaki wo vinar ban sake
 i swear this dialogue with him, i was first convinced and then injured
 kohinoor aayega
 Life will give us a chance to bring it
 is ummid ke saath main cinema ghar se apane ghar laut aayaa
 In the name of Aurangzeb, we cannot tolerate the road but can be so desperate for Kohinoor touched by Babur's hand, did not understand
 yahi kya kam he moorkhon ne abhi rashtrawaad ke naam par un logon ko deshadrohi nahin ghoshit kiya he jinhone ankhon kaa nur kohinoor angrezon ko tohafe main de diya
 Kohinoor is the name of the occasion for us Hindus to become winners from losers
 ise laane ke naam par gaanv-gaanv gali-gali itihaas ke koodaakaar ajab-gajab ke kutark failaate rahete hai
 As soon as it was learned that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was going to London in November 2015, Hindi channels created a ruckus about the Kohinoor diamond
 kohinoor ko lekar lok swapn rachaa gaya ki yahi he wo hira
 Look closely, tear your eyes and see
 modi ji lekar aane vaale hai
 The channels did a trick
 jab bhi likhaa, prashnvachak chinh ke saath hi likhaa ki modi queen se kohinoor kii maang kar sakate hai? kya modi queen ke saath lunch ke dauraan kohinoor heere kii maang kargen ? you tub par maujuud in channelon kii cliping se pataa chalata he ki acha khaasaa propeganda khadaa kiya gaya
 His words made it seem as if PM Modi was going to say during lunch that Madam, the diamond which is placed next to you, if found
 
 
 main nahin, hamaare mulk ke channel vaale maang rahe hai
 
 
 if
 
 
 nahin to koi baat nahin

 Meanwhile, Azam Khan from Uttar Pradesh started to make a statement that Prime Minister should bring Kohinoor as well as bring the ring of Tipu Sultan from London on which Ram is written
 kuch to khyaal rakhaa hota aazam sahab states kaa bhi
 The jeweler did not go to the shop to ask for a ring with diamonds from our PM

 But hi
 sarkaar ne ye kya kar diya
 If someone had not been robbed, he would have said that he had stolen it

 The Modi government abolished all the excitement regarding Kohinoor

 In this way only our museum will be empty

 Go o world people, we sacrificed the dream of the country for the sake of the museum

 The Reserve Bank has said that in all these cases, banks should make the customers fully aware of all the benefits and provide them all the benefits of the entire scheme

 salmaan khan kii baraat jaise najaare main jab sitare jami par utre to bas badshaah nahin tha
 Shahrukh was missing a lot
 yaad aa gaya film om shanti om kaa wo manjar, jab shahrukh khan ne har bade sitare ko ikhatta kar apni dhak dikhaai thi, lekin salmaan khan ke is dam ke saamne ab tak bollywood kii pichhali sari mehfil feeki pad gai
 Stars gathered for Being Human When Salman voiced the stars for Being Human, an organization associated with the well being of the well-to-do, everyone ran
 aamir khan, akshay, saf ali khan, sanjay dutt, ajay devgan, govinda koi kam nahin lag rahaa tha, lekin jis tarah se ramp par katrina or salmaan ke peeche-peeche saare bade sitare chal rahe the lag rahaa tha maanon salmaan kii baraat chal rahi ho
 It is not that only friends have become witnesses of Katrina and Salman's catwalk
 darshak ddeergha main salmaan kii donon maatayen maujuud thi, helen or salama
 Salman's sister-in-law Malayaka Arora was also in the visitors' gallery

 It is as if the entire family is present to bless Salman and Kat
 salmaan ke rang main rangi katrinashridevi, sushmita sen, priti jinta farah khan amisha patel tivenkal khanna sab ke sab us vakt isi chat ke neeche is haseen najaare kaa lutf uthaa rahe the
 Aamir's wife Kiran was also seeing the sight of Salman and Katrina's catwalk from some corner
 salmaan khan kii pari yani katrina caff jo bade najaakat se salmaan ke collection ko apane husn se chaar chand laga rahi hai
 All the colors of the gown that this angel has worn are of Salman
 salmaan ke ek khaas paintig ko is goun main utaara gaya he
 In the color of Salman, Katrina certainly looked no less than a fairy queen
 salmaan ke is sho main sirf katrina hi ek heroin thi, jisane ramp par apana jaadu bikheraa
 In the procession, there was a procession of all colors in the procession of Baratisilaman of every religion
 bollywood kaa bed bvoy, good bvoy, smart bvoy
 The Charming Boy all arrived as a wedding party
 saat phere to nahin ho sake, lekin katrina ke saath catwalk zarur kiya salmaan ne or thodi hi der main doston ke saath or unka puraa khandaan ramp par utar padaa, lekin apane baratiyon ke rang-dhang par salmaan kii nazar badi tej thi
 That is why he does not hesitate to give Bollywood's status to his most special guest
 sanjay dutt kii bed bvoy image main salmaan kii is mehfil main chaar chand laga diye
 Salman's most charming hero is Aamir Khan and Salman most praised the looks of any hero for aamirsalman, he was Akshay Kumar, but it looked like a rockstar in Salman's procession was Saif Ali Khan
 is mehfil main agar har kisi ke chehre par masti or muskaan jhalak rahi thi, to ajay devgan behad syrius lag rahe the or bhabhi ke devarji yani arbaz or sohail ke kya kehane? salmaan kehete hai mere donon bhai bade hi kool hai

 Not only the parents of Haryana or Delhi, but the parents of the whole country are worried about the safety of their children due to the Ryan Murder Case
 aise main mumbai police ne is taraf ek pahal kii he
 The Mumbai police conducts a campaign long ago called Police Didi
 is abhiyaan ke tahat mahila pulicekarmi skulon or gharon main jaakar bacchon ko shaareerik shoshan ke khilaaf sajag karti hai
 The program consists of constables and ASI level policemen
 bacchon ko good tach or bed tach ke bare main bataati hai
 After the Gurugram incident, when this police didi arrived at Miftul Uloom, Urdu Medium School, Sakinaka, not only the children but their parents also came to listen to them
 gurugram main skool shauchayal main ek maasoom ke katl se mumbai main bhi maa-baap andar tak hill gaye hai or police didi jaise abhiyaan kii kaaphi jarurat mahasoos kii jane lagi he
 While learning from the case of Ryan Murder, Mumbai Police has decided to take action
 mumbai police'police-didi' naam kii apni pahal ko dobaaraa launch kiya he
 According to Police Constable Kavita Swapnil Lad, we also show a clip of Aamir Khan's program to children in schools where they have told about Good Touch and Bed Touch
 hamen bacchon ko vishwaas dilaanaa hota he ki unke saath koi galat harakat karegaa to ham unki madad ke liye aaenge
 Some parents also hesitate to talk to their children on such a topic, the Police Didi campaign is also helpful for them
 sakinaka nivasee farjaan bhai kehete hai ki ye kaarykram hamaare bacchon ke liye bahut acha he auki hamaare liye bhi
 The way police didi talks to children, it is understood that this is not a matter of shame
 ham bacchon se jude ek behad samvedansheel mudde par baat kar rahe hai
 On which, if they are not vocal, then it can have a tremendous impact on their life
 miftul ulum skul ke shikshak saiyad jubair akhtar ke mutabik ham bhi apane bacchon ko ye jaankaree dete hai par ham unhen padhaate bhi hai or bhi bahut saare vishyon par unase baat karte hai
 So when the police come to the Didi school and tell them this themselves, it has a different effect
 bacchon ko diarect unase conection feel hota he or wo khud ko majboot mahasoos karte hai
 In addition, the police will collect feedback from parents, parents-teacher association and school administration
 aapako bataa den ki pichley saal mumbai ke andheri main ek international skool ke trustee or teacher ne kathith taur par ek 3 saal kii bacchee kaa rape kiya tha
 After that incident, the Mumbai Police had started the 'police-didi' initiative to make school children aware of sexual abuse
 mumbai police ke abhiyaan main nami skulon se lekar slam bastiyon main chalane vaale skool shaamil hai
 According to the senior PI Avinash Dharmadhikari of Sakinaka, the incidents of sexual exploitation of children are more in the slum areas, but even the high society has not survived them
 isliye police didi mumbai ke nami giraami skulon main bhi bacchon se milti hai

 adaalat ne kaha ki do saal tak muslim yuvati ke saath shaareerik sambandh rakhane ke baad deepak dogra ne usase vivaah karne se manaa kar diya
 To avoid legal punishment, Deepak did a fake marriage ceremony, even though he knew it was neither legal nor legitimate
 twarit adaalat ne kaha ‘yuvati dwaara pesh sabooton se yah saaf he ki deepak ne mandir main farji vivaah samaaroh kiya
 Additional Sessions Judge Nivedita Anil Sharma said, "it is clear that she never intended to marry the girl
" vah jaanata tha ki vah hindu he or yuvati muslim he
 Even then, the accused committed a fake marriage, while the priest told him that marriage does not take place in that temple
 ’ adaalat ne ‘dilli peedit muaavja yojana’ ke tahat yuvati ko ek lakh rupee kaa muaavja bhi diya
 While imposing a fine of Rs 60,000 on Deepak, a resident of Mubarakpur, the court said that this amount should also be given to the victim as compensation
 abhiyojan paksh ke anusaar, 20 varshiya yuvati ne aktubar 2010 ko deepak ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai

 She promised to marry him but after she became pregnant, Deepak refused to marry her and asked her to undergo an abortion
 deepak ke ravaiye se kshubdh peedit ne police se sampark kiya
 To save himself Deepak along with his family took the victim to the temple, the two put garlands on each other, put vermilion on her demand and said that she had married him
 phir deepak ne saboot ke taur par kuch tasviren leen or use chhod diya
 The court said, 'deepak is Hindu and the woman is Muslim
 jab tak donon main se ek bhi dharm parivartit kar duusare kaa dharm na apanaae tab tak unka vivaah nahin ho saktaa
 Or both could get married under the Special Marriage Act
 ’ aaropee ko balaatkaar kaa doshi or kanuunan shaadi kiye bina farji vivaah samaaroh karne kaa doshi iharaaya gaya
 In the context of the girl's consent to have a sexual relationship with the accused, the judge said it is clear from the evidence that Deepak had made physical relations with his sister by promising to marry the Muslim girl after her marriage
 nyaayadhish ne kaha, ‘agar vah aisa vaada nahin karata to yuvati use apane saath daihik sambandh banane kii anumati nahin detii
 The convict appealed for leniency, stating that he works in the factory and the whole family depends on him

 Senior doctors say that neither Nitish nor any of the officials of his office have ever said anything directly to him during the last 10 years

 ’ pujaara ne kaha ki unhone pink ball se khilne kaa lutf uthaaya lekin gugali ko dekhne main ab bhi samasya aa rahi he
 He said, 'I enjoyed playing with pink ball but there are some challenges especially in the milky light when it becomes difficult to see googly
 ’ yuvaraj singh niraash hai or vah saath hi hairaan hai ki unke gendbaaj ummid ke mutabik pradarshan nahin kar paae
 'the secret is to swing the pink ball' When asked about the pink ball, Yuvraj gave a surprising answer
 unhone kaha, ‘is par (pink ball par) pratikriya dena kuch mushkil he kyonki jab ham gendbaaji kar rahe the to gend kaaphi swing nahin kar rahi thi jabaki jab vah gendbaaji kar rahe the to yah swing kar rahi thi
 It is still a mystery

 Due to scarcity of water in the dams of the state, the government has clearly told the farmers not to plant paddy during the Rabi season, because the government will not be able to get them the way they provide water through the dams every year

 Due to drought in the state, the ground water level has gone down from 800 to 1200 feet, while 44 dams in the state have not been able to get waterlogged due to less than average rainfall

 The water filled in these dams is becoming less and more frequent
 andeshaa jaahir kiya ja rahaa he ki garmi kaa mausam aane ke pehle hi ye baandh suukh sakate hai
 In these circumstances, providing water to the people both for four months of cold and summer, ie for eight months, will prove to be crooked for the government, so the government has stopped farmers from planting more water-consuming crops

 The government has warned farmers to take strict action if they violate it
 sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha he ki wo kisaanon ko iske liye baandhon or naharon se pani nahin degi

 All the cases are in the last one week after which the total dengue cases in Delhi has reached 1692
 iske alaava chikangunia ke 1070 nae maamle saamne aane ke baad dilli main ab chikangunia ke maamalon kii sankhya 3695 tak pahunch gai he
 Questions arose on the report of MCD and Delhi Government, however, if CAG believes that MCD and Delhi Government are underreporting those who die from Dengue
 sieji ne 2013-2015 tak ke maamalon kii jaanch karne ke baad ye nishkarsh nikaala he
 According to the CAG, in these two years, 409 people died due to dengue while the Death Review Committee reported only 60 deaths due to dengue
 is maamle ko lekar south emsidi kii sthai samiti kii baithak main vipaksh ne sawaal khadey kiye
 Questioning the work of civil agencies, however, according to the MCD, the CAG may have included the data from the rapid test kit, so the figures may have been higher
 baharhaal aankade kam ho yaa zyada ek baat to saaf he ki agar dengue se ek bhi maut hoti he to ye civil agenciyon ke kaam karne ke tareeke par to sawaal khadey karata hi he

 bataa den, is baat kii jaankaree police ke ek varisht adhikari ne di
 He said that the police is also investigating the role of CBSE officers

 Know what was the matter, the 12th economics paper was on March 27 and the 10th mathematics paper was held on March 28
 jiske baad whatsap par paper li hone kii khabar ai thi
 The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) took the decision immediately after the paper was leaked
 jahaan sibiesai kaksha 10veen or kaksha 12veen ke ek-ek paper ko dobaaraa karwaane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Where CBSE had said that 10th and 12th examination will be held again

 haalanki sibiesai ne isse inkaar kiya
 After that, the board has issued a notification regarding many papers, that the paper has not been leaked
 iconomics ke paper ke liye bhi sibiesai ne paper li hone se manaa kar diya tha
 Now the CBSE examinations will be like this, after two papers have been leaked, they have decided to get the exam done with a new pattern
 jisamen pariksha electronic tareeke se karwaai jaaegi
 This pattern is different from before and is believed to prevent activities like paper leaks

 (input ffp) Former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has raised a question mark over the deployment of additional 25 thousand security forces in Jammu and Kashmir
 umr abdulla ne kaha, 'sena or vayusena ko hai alert par kyon rakhaa gaya
 Is it about 35A or delimitation? is tarah kaa alert agar jari kiya gaya he to yah bahut kuch alag he
 '25 thousand soldiers will be sent to Jammu and Kashmir
 isse pehle narendra modi sarkaar ne ghati main 100 companiyon ko bhejne ke aadesh die the
 Verbal orders have been issued to send more troops to the paramilitary forces in the valley
 sutron ke mutabik pichley 4 dinon main central armd police forcej (CAPF) kii 281 companiyaan kashmir pahunch chuki hai
 The central government had earlier decided to deploy 100 additional companies of security forces in the Kashmir Valley
 isamen siarpief kii 50, biguef kii 10, esasabi kii 30, itibipi kii 10 companiyaan tainaat kii jane vaali thim
 The political parties of Kashmir had reacted sharply after the government ordered the deployment of 10,000 additional personnel in Jammu and Kashmir before August 15
 What “on going situation” in Kashmir would require the army AND the Air Force to be put on alert? This isn’t about 35A or delimitation
 This sort of alert, if actually issued, would be about something very different
 https: / / t

 Trump gave him huge responsibilities for a few days, but slowly Trump got irritated with him, the situation became such that Trump 'fired' John Bolton

 Actually there is a growing mistrust between the two leaders behind it

 John Bolton said that by doing so the President would give recognition to a terrorist group
 fahrren policy patrika ke mutabik bolton ye maanate the ki ek aatanki gut ke netaaon ko camp david main bulaane se ek galat pratha chal padegi

 For the people of Delhi, who have seen many rallies of farmers from road to parliament, the arrival of farmers from thousands of miles away is no longer a matter of special curiosity
 dilli main apana deraa jamaa chuke peshey se ejeeniyar nand patel kehete hai, ‘‘main bhi ek kisaan ke ghar se hi hum
 i have a house in Chaubepur, Banaras
 shuruyaat main jab dilli main hajaaron kisaan aate the to lagata tha ki ho na ho abaki baar netaaon ke man main ghabrahat paidaa hogi
 The voices of the farmers will create a ruckus in the Parliament
 par ab lagata he ki sansad kii deevaaren itani majboot hai ki kisaanon kii guhaar vahaan se takaraakar chur-chur ho jaati he
 "actually, these lines of Nand Patel are an expression of the misery of the peasants who have got entangled in politics
" dilli uniwarsity main soshal work vishay ke vidhyaarthee manish har baar aise andolanon main shaamil hote hai
 The last agitation, he says, took place on October 2, when farmers arrived at the Delhi border with their truck-trolleys
 lekin us andolan kaa kya koi hasil he? sarkaar ne kisaanon ko lollypop pakadaakar waapas bhej diya
 While the farmers involved in the rally, take care not the leader! Had to bring a month's ration-water, then what happened that he had to return to his feet without asking for it? This time too, big leaders came on the stage
 satta paksh par hamalaa bolaa
 a free forum was found for the election
 tikhe bayaan die or phir chalate bane
 The truth is that Rahul Gandhi benefited most from the platform of 'kisan Mukti March'
 unke baad seetaram yechuri, sharad pavaar, arvind kejariwal, faruk abdulla, di raja ko hua
 Rather, i say that more than raising the problems of the farmers, these forums are a way to save the existence of these leaders
 arvind kejariwali se puuchhie kya dilli main kisaan khush hai?labboluab ye he ki ek baar phir dilli ke dar par kisaanon ne joardaar dastak di
 But what will be the effect of this knock? There is doubt about this in most of the people
 swabhimaan shetakari sanghathan ke mukhiya or kisaanon ke mudde par hameshaa se mukhar rahe raju setty is sawaal par kehete hai, ye baat sach he ki kisaan kii ansuni har sarkaar karti rahi he
 But this time we gathered 21 political parties on one platform with the issues of farmers

 Actually, Raju Shetty and other leaders are also bringing two private bills together
 pehla ‘kisaanon ko purna karj mukt hone kaa adhikaar vidheyak-2018’ or doosraa ‘kisaanon ko laagat se dedh guna daam milane kaa adhikaar-2018’
 But here the question arises whether there is a possibility of passage of private bill? On this, he says, we know that not even once in history has the private member bill passed

 Is the debt of farmers expected to be forgiven? On this Raju Shetty says, "why not if the government can waive millions of crores of loans to save the industries, then why can't the loans of farmers of more than one lakh crores be forgiven?" After getting completely debt free, the second bill has demanded a price of one and a half times the cost of the crop so that the farmer does not fall into this trap again

 Kashi is the destination of Shiva devotees where devotees have been coming in search of salvation for centuries
 saakshaat mahadev kaa aashirwad paane kii kaamana ho yaa mrityu par vijay paane kii ichha, shivbhakton ke liye mahamrityunjay mandir main hajiri maatr punya kaa bhaagi hone jaisaa he
 In the Madagin region of Varanasi, Bholenath sits as Mrityunjay Mahadev
 inke darshan maatr se puri hoti he man kii har kaamana
 It is believed that if a devotee attends 40 consecutive Mondays and offers this form of Trilochan with flowers, milk and water, then the troubles from his life are eliminated in a moment
 varanasi ke mahamrityunjay mandir main bhakt or pandit nirantar mantroccharan main lage rahete hai taaki mahadev ko prasann kar unka aashirwad paaya ja sake
 To get rid of premature death
 sava lakh baar mantra jaap se miltaa he labhamahamrityunjay mandir main roj chamatkaar kii nai kahaniyaan likhi jaati hai
 Devotees visit the temple 3 times a day and become devotees of virtue
 vaise to yahaan shiv bhakton kii sabhi manokamanaayen puri karte hai
 But victory is especially found here on the fear of death
 manyata he ki agar is mandir main sava lakh baar mahamrityujny mantra kaa jaap kiya jaae to sir par mandara rahaa akaal mrityu kaa khatra hameshaa ke liye dur ho jaataa he
 Chanting the mantra on a special date after seeing the horoscope is considered fruitful, but chanting of this mantra on Monday is considered fruitful, but only after consulting astrologers, it is considered appropriate to chant this mantra only on a special date
 darasal, jataka kii kundali dekhakar hi jyotishi ye bataate hai ki jataka par maut kaa khatra kitna bada he
 Accordingly, the date of mantra chanting and worship is fixed
 mahamrityunjay mantra ke jaap se akaal mrityu kaa khatra to dur hota hi he saath hi rahu-ketu or shani jaise krur grahon ke prabhaav ko bhi kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Happiness can be filled with the blessings of Mahadev in the life stuck in the crooked movement of these planets

 rose alag-alag netaa bhaashan de rahe hai, or bahut gambhir baaten kii ja rahi hai
 But there is a very large section of all parties which runs a intelligence campaign
 soshal media par alag-alag tarah se chutki lee jaati he, jokes kahe jate hai virdohi party ke logon or netaaon ke liye
 The same thing happened in Delhi, let us know that some such jokes arising from the creative minds of the activists are making a big difference in the electoral riots of Delhi
 mahatvapurn yah he ki isamen bhi congress bahut peeche he or aam aadmi party or bhartiya janata party hi zyaada sakriy dikhte hai
 First of all, when Shazia Ilmi left AAP and joined BJP, BJP workers started tweeting showing the picture of Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, Yogendra Yadav and Kumar Vishwas that 'four have survived but the party is yet to come

 unhone bhi chutki lenaa shuru kiya ki shazia ne aap chhodkar bijepi main judane par kaha ki aam aadmi party main unki puch nahin ho rahi thi, ye sunakar adwani or murali manohar joshi hans pade
 While there is a ruckus on the issue of bjp's referring to Kejriwal as a rowdy tribe, BJP activist Arvind Kejriwal jokes about his involvement in the movement and his sit-in politics, writing that when Kejriwal's wife served pulses and rice Kejriwal said, i will not eat food, these two have met
 is campan main aam aadmi party bahut jor laga rahi he
 This whatsapp message was sent on their behalf that BJP and Congress candidates get shocked when they go for campaigning and the public replies that we will vote for AAP only
 mujhe sabase badhiya to us din laga jab bijepi ne kiran bedi kaa naam apane mukhyamantri pad ke liye ghoshit kar diya
 The common people quipped that late last night Anna Hazare called Kejriwal and Kiran Bedi and said that our movement was successful
 party koi bhi jite mukhyamantri hamaara hoga
 It is only such campaigns that make the election a little more lush and if the general public feels a bit of fun in serious elections, then there is a taste of a little publicity
 or hamako ye sab isliye aata rahata he ki gujarat modi kaa home state he isliye bhaajapai yahan zyaada agressive rahete hai or agsit pols main kadi ladaai ke chalate aam aadmi party ke kaaryakartaaon kaa utsaah bhi badha hua he

 How Hyderabad became a part of India after independence is one of the most interesting and best-kept secrets of Indian history
 aakhir 17 sitambar, 1948 ko or uske baad aisa hyderabad main kya hua ki bhartiya sena ne yahaan ke nizaam ko bhartiya sangh main milane or sarender karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 This was the time when 13 months had passed since this country was liberated
 is din ko telugana samarthak hyderabad libration de ke taur par manaate hai
 But actually there was a lot of bloodshed at that time
 is bare main agar in logon ko pataa chalegaa to unke paas jashn manaane kii koi vajah nahin rah jaaegi
 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel decided to send troops to Hyderabad after the news of the Nizam's persecution of the general public
 haalanki ise 'oparation polo' or 'oparation caterpillar' kaa naam diya gaya tha
 But it was named 'police Action'
 riyasat main faili avyavashtha ko roak paane main nizaam kii sena naakaam rahi
 People took advantage of such a situation and looted it fiercely
 katleam bhi machaa jiskaa shikaar alpsankhyak log hue
 And in this environment the Indian state kept its eyes closed
 shodhakarta captain pandu ranga reddy ne bataaya, 'us vakt hatya or lut kaa maahaul tha jiske shikaar zyada muslim vyapaaree log bane
 These were people from the districts that are currently part of Karnataka and Maharashtra
 'disambar 1948 main 3 congress netaaon kaa ek dal hyderabad bheja gaya
 These leaders were Pandit Sundarlal, Qazi Abdul Ghaffar and Maulana Egyptian
 hyderabad main teen hafte rahakar is dal ne ground jiro se jo report bheji vah kaaphi visphotak thi
 There were shocking facts in this report which have not been fully revealed even today
 iske baad pandu ranga reddy ne artiai act ke jariye dilli ke nehru memorial mujium and librari or tinmurti house main hyderabad par sunderlaal kii report maangi thi
 The library responded to Reddy in January and said that the report was not available with him
 iske baad itihaaskaar mohammad safiullah ne apane sutron ke jariye is report kii ek copy july 2013 ko praapt kii
 Historians say that the government was not happy with the work done by the committee
 safiullah ne kaha, 'mere paas un patron kii copy he jo ki sardaar patel ne kaaji abdul gaffaar ko likhi thi or poocha tha ki tumhen hyderabad jane kisne kaha tha
 Who told you to submit this report to the Government of India? Police action was also coined essentially with a view to cheating the United Nations
 bharat sarkaar ne police karrwai ko miltry ection kaa naam diya
 Had it not been there, the United Nations would have interfered and then another state would have been created
 safiullah kehete hai ki usase jang kii sthiti utpann hoti
 The Nizam wanted to go to the United Nations, but he withdrew his complaint on 17 September in a telecast for the state of Hyderabad
 pandu ranga reddy maanate hai ki is cese kii vajah se aaj bhi sanyukt raashtra main yah baat hoti he ki 1956 main hyderabad rajya ko andhra rajya ke saath andhra pradesh banane ke liye milaayaa gaya tha
 Reddy said, 'the purpose of all this was to remove Hyderabad from the map of India
 mai maanata hum ki 1969 main, jab telugana banane kii maang shuru hui, tab pradhanmantri indira gandhi iske liye raji nahin hui, kyonki vah jaanati thi ki yah faisla vivekpurna nahin hoga, telugana kaa bhaugalik kshetra bhi hyderabad rajya jitna hi he
 Interestingly, the first Emergency of Independent India was declared in September 1948
 yah immergency tab ghoshit kii gai jab 36 hajaar bhartiya sainik hyderabad main pravesh kar chuke the, kyonki sarkaar ashankit thi ki bharat ke anya hisson ke alpsankhyak is adhigrahan ko lekar kya pratikriya denge

 torant kaa bain hona nayaa nahin he
 In the coming days, there is a campaign to shut it all over the world, but it seems impossible to close it, because all the torrent sites that have been closed are still used in other ways
 udhaaharan ke taur par mashhoor torant website da pyret be ko le sakate hai
 The US government targeted and completely banned almost all its servers
 itnaa hi nahin iske ko founder ko bhi giraftaar kar liya gaaya
 Despite all this, people are still downloading movies, software, songs and videos from The Pirate Bay
 haalanki ab ye pehle jaisaa aasaan nahin he, lekin phir bhi aisa ho rahaa he
 In addition to The Pirate Bay, there are Kickass and Extra Torrent websites which are periodically closed
 bharat main bhi department of telecom ne internet sarvice prowiders ko in torant websites ko sakhti se block karne ko kaha he or inhen block bhi kiya ja chukaa he
 Despite the ban, such torrents are used
 It says that there is a cut of everything on the Internet, there are also ways to open a block torrent website
 jinhen thodi internet or proxi kii ilm he wo aasaani se torant se dowloding karte hai
 What is a proxy and how it works? a basic tool to open any URL of any blocked website like torrent is proxy
 proxi sarwar kya he ise samajhane ke liye ek udhaaharan lete hai
 Suppose Facebook is blocked in your office i
e
 if you request to open Facebook from the IP of the internal network, then the website will not open
 lekin agar aap fasebuk kholane ke lae poxi sarwar yuj karenge to khul jayega
 This is because your IP is changed and the changed IP requests to open Facebook
 aise hi torant ke saath bhi he
 Despite the website being blocked, that website can be opened from another IP via proxy
 haalanki proxi ke jariye khulne vaali website original ke mukaable slo hoti hai
 This is what happens when torrent domains are closed, the government of many countries ban the torrent website and remove it from the internet
 aise main un torant website ko chalaane vaale havers use kisi duusare domen par shift kar dete hai
 Torrent's famous websites are running by another name these days
 haalanki ye naam original se miltaa julata hi hota he isliye jo torant se lagaataar dowloding karte hai unhen iskaa andaja ho jaataa he
 Apart from this, there are many proxy tools that work bypassing IP by installing on your computer and browser
 isse bhi log torant website aasaani se kholkar dowloding karte hai
 Let me tell you that downloading from torrents is illegal and there is a provision for punishment for this
