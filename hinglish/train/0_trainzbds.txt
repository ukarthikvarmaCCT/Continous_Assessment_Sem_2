 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has started the Lok Sabha election campaign to be held in 2019 next year
 desh ke alag-alag rajyon main logon se ve sidhe samvaad kar apane chaar saal kaa hisaab kitaab bataane main jute hue hai
 After Rajasthan, Punjab and UP, PM Modi will address farmers in West Bengal, the fort of Mamta Banerjee
 bijepi ne pashchim bengal main kamalakhilaane kii ranneeti par kaam karnaa shuru kar diya he
 The party is eyeing the Junglemahal area of the state
 pichley kuch dinon main is kshetra main bijepi kii sakriyata teji se badi he
 BJP president Amit Shah had a meeting with party leaders in Purulia district of Junglemahal area on June 28, 17 days ago
 bengal ke ran main bijepi ke sheersh netaaon kii lagaataar duusari meeting jangalmahal kshetra main hone ja rahi he
 PM Modi will address farmers through an 'agriculture Welfare Inclusion' rally in Midnapore today
 ve lagaataar desh ke kisaanon ko saadhane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 After the BJP President, there is now a clear indication of PM Modi's rally in this area that the BJP is trying to establish its roots in Bengal through the Junglemahal region
 bataa den ki jangalmahal ilaaka ek daur main maovadiyon kaa majboot garh mana jaataa tha
 Junglemahal is mainly a tribal belt
 is kshetra ke tahat purulia, bankura or pashchim midanapur teen jile aate hai
 There are six Lok Sabha seats in these three districts, out of which at least four seats are tribal and OBC dominated
 piem modi kaa bengal daura bijepi ke chunaav plan ke tahat dekha ja rahaa he
 Five days before Mamta Banerjee's July 21 rally, Modi's rally is considered a well thought out strategy
 mamata 21 july se apane chunavi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kar sakati hai
 This is a big setback for West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her party
 tiemasi ke mul votbank adivaasiyon ke samarthan main badlaav dikhaa he
 TMC has lost 34 per cent of panchayat seats in the three districts
 yahi vajah he ki mamata banerjee in jilon main party sanghathan ko phir se majboot karne ke liye sakriy ho rahi hai
 Why Junglemahal itself? In the recently held panchayat election, BJP won 150 seats falling under this region, after which three TMC ministers had to resign
 jangalmahal main kai safal sarkari yojanaon ke baavjood tiemasi jhargram ke kuch adivasee panchayat kshetron main namakan daakhil nahin kar saki
 BJP has set a target of putting 22 seats in the 42 seats of West Bengal in the 2019 elections
 jabaki 2014 main pashchim bengal main bijepi sirf do siten hi jeet saki thi
 Union Minister Babul Supriyo Asansol and SS Ahluwalia are BJP mps from Darjeeling seat
 2014 main mamata banerjee kii netritv vaali tiemasi ne 34 siton par jeet hasil kii thi jabaki bijepi kii hi tarah congress or sipiem ke khate main do-do siten aayi thim
 On the lines of the 2015 assembly in West Bengal, the Congress and the Left can also contest the 2019 general elections
 mamata ko aam chunaav main bijepi or congress donon se alag alag do do haath karnaa padegaa
 Most of the seats in which the BJP is focusing on in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are in the tribal dominated districts of North Bengal, South Bengal and Junglemahal
 bijepi mukhya rup se balurghat, kooch bihar, alipuradwar, jalpaigudi, malda, purulia, jhargram, medinipur, krishnanagar, haavda seat par focus kar rahi he

 On his first death anniversary, know 5 important things related to his huge personality
 1
 Inspiration for others: Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a very humble person and he was far away from egoism
 pichley saal unke nidhan par raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne vaajapeyi ke bare main kaha tha, 'purv pradhanmantri vaajapeyi main ahankaar bilkul bhi nahin tha or main unheen se prerit hokar vinamrata ko aatmsaat karne kaa prayaas karata rahata hum
 "the President said that he had shared his experience with him in Parliament," i was a Rajya Sabha MP when he was the Prime Minister of the country
 sansad ke galiyaaron main hameshaa meraa or unka aamanaa-saamana ho jaataa tha
 i saw that on such occasions Vajpayee used to greet from a distance
 'raashtrapati kovind ne kaha, 'vaajapeyi ke is vyavhaar ko dekhakar mujhe kabhi-kabhi aatmaglani bhi hoti thi ki kahaan main ek chota sa saansad or kahaan vaajapeyi desh ke pradhanmantri
 Vajpayee did not have a sense of ego far and wide and i always thought that ego free public life is very good
 ye maine unheen se siikhaa or main apane jivan main bhi is vinamrata ko aatmsaat karne kaa prayaas karata rahata hum

 In her address, she told the people that if she really accepts the slogan 'how should our leader be like Atal Bihari' then she should support me
 'dinesh sharma ne aage kaha, 'vaajapeyi ke bhaashanon kaa janata par bahut asar hota tha
 He asked the public that if they wear only kurta and do not wear pajamas then how will they look? The public was surprised at Atal's question that what Vajpayee really wanted to say? Meanwhile someone said
 
 
 kharaab dikhenge
 On this, Vajpayee immediately said that you gave me a shirt by winning the election of MP from Lucknow
 mujhe nagar nigam meyar chunaav main jeet darjkar pyjama bhi chahie

 milansaar vyaktitvvajpeyi ke nidhan ke ek din baad jaya jetali ne ek tasviir tivetor par share kii thi, jo unki beti aditi or purv cricketer ajay jadeja kii shaadi kii he

 The miraculous personality dates back to 1957 when Atal Bihari Vajpayee reached the Lok Sabha for the first time by winning the Balrampur Lok Sabha seat by 10 thousand votes
 pichhali haar se sabak lete hue 1962 ke aam chunaav main congress ne atal bihari vaajapeyi ko haraane ke liye gandhivadi shubhadra joshi ko unke khilaaf maidan main utaara tha
 Both had been part of the Quit India movement, but were different at the ideological level

 They considered him the future Prime Minister
 vaajapeyi ko balrampur seat se congress kii jeet ke liye unhone bada khatra mana

 Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav, while taunting BJP President Amit Shah's claim of winning more than '73 seats' out of the 80 seats in the Lok Sabha elections, today said that the saffron party, scared of mere preparation for the grand alliance, should forget this plan
 akhilesh ne medhaavi vidhyaarthiyon ko laptop vitaran ke maukey par samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha ki samaajawaadee log loksabhaa chunaav ke liye taiyaar hai or vah apni ranneeti abhi nahin bataaenge
 He exhorted the BJP to say that he would win more than 73 seats, but he should forget it and talk of 70 plus because he has lost three seats in the by-election
 mahagathbandhan ke bare main puche jane par akhilesh ne kaha 'ismahagathbandhanke bare main media main charchaaen joro par he to mahagathbandhan hona lagbhag tay he
 As far as UP is concerned, the alliance will be here too
 jo bhaajapa ne banaaya tha, vahi hamane chori kar liya or ab vahi ham us par aajamaa rahe hai
 'it is noteworthy that BJP President Amit Shah had said in a rally held at Chandauli recently that the BJP will win more than 73 seats out of 80 in Uttar Pradesh in the next Lok Sabha election
 yah aankada 73 se kam katai nahin hoga
 The BJP and its ally Apna Dal won a total of 73 seats in the last Lok Sabha election
 purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne daawa kiya ki pradesh ke logon ne dekh liya he ki bhaajapa ne unhen kaise dhokhaa diya, raajnneetik laabh ke li kaise jatiyon main ulajhaa diya gaya, kaise dharm ke naam par nafrat failaai gai
 Yadav said that the BJP is forgetting old things like demonetisation and making new things like defense corridor when Lok Sabha elections are approaching
 aaj jab aam sadaken nahin ban paa rahi hai or pulon ke liye anumati nahin mil rahi he to aakhir yah galiyara kab or kaise banegaa?sapa adhyaksh ne kaha ki vah medhaavi chaatro ko laptop dekar pradesh kii bhaajapa sarkaar ko uskaa vah vaada yaad dilaanaa chaahate hai, jo usne apane chunaav ghoshnaptr main kiya tha

 The last two phases of the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh (UP) are due
 in do charnon main adhikansh siten purvanchal kii he
 bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi is also a candidate from Varanasi, then SP and BSP also have a strong hold in this area
 aaie ajtak se khaas baatcheet main jaanate hai samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ke dil main kya he, in chunaavon ko lekar
 
 
 
 
 Question- Even at this age, we work hard
 jawaab -mehnat to kerani padegi, samaajawaadee party sabase aage chal rahi he
 question-modi claims that the BJP had achieved the same success in 84 years, this time BJP will get the same success
 jawaab -jahaan tak modi kaa sawaal he to shuru-shuru main laga tha ki acha maahaul he
 But even then there was not such an atmosphere as he thinks about UP and the country
 upi main to ab wo haalat rahi nahin
 There was some good influence in the general public as well
 sawaal -iske peeche vajah kya he
 The answer is that other parties have also spoken
 jo ghatana gujarat main hui usko lekar alpsankhyakon main jabardast asantosh he
 Secondly, there is no effect of Modi on people divided into small castes, Modi has influence on big castes
 sawaal -western upi main bijepi kaa prachaar-prasar kaaphi rahaa, bijepi or modi ke paksh main hawa dikhi
 Answer - The socialist voters of Muzaffarnagar are Muslims there
 bijepi ne vahaan hindu-musalmaan chalaane kii koshish kii lekin musalamaanon ne vot diya samaajawaadee party ko
 When i asked him, 'there was a lot of atrocities with you, he said that atrocities happened in many places, but the UP government has helped us well and adequately
 samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar or madad karne vaale netaaon ke naam ginaakar bataae ki hamaari madad hui he
 Because of this, the Samajwadi Party has got and the other thing that has happened is done by BJP
 sawaal -aapke virdohi kehete hai ki danga aapaki party ne karaayaa or ajam kaa bhi haath he
 Answer - i am surprised that Azam Saheb did not even know about this incident
 ajam sahab ko tab jaankaree hui jab puri kii puri ghatana ho gai
 We telephoned him, he was not really aware
 phir maine kaha ki chaliye ham or aap chalem, to unhone kaha ki ham or aap jarur chalenge
 But we get full information about the incident, after which Azam went on the spot
 sawaal -ajam par aarope he ki unhone bhadakaau bhaashan die jisaki vajah se chunaav ayog ne pabandi lagaai
 Answer - There is favor with Azam Saheb
 sanvaidhanik sansthaaon se main is tarah kii ummid nahin karata
 In democracy, there is complete right and freedom to speak
 agar koi gambhir ghatana he to phir karrwai kaa adhikaar he lekin ye chunaav ayog ne galat kaam kiya he or samvidhan virdohi kaam kiya he
 Q: You have been the defense minister and have gone to all the areas
 ye kahana kaha tak uchit he ki kisi ek varg vishesh kii vajah se jang jiti gai
 Answer - He did not talk about a class
 unhone sahi baat kahi thi
 There was a Muslim who fought and was martyred and it is right that Abdul Hameed did not win the battle alone
 agar wo kud nahin padaa hota to kya haalat hoti hindustani fouj kii or kya parinaam hota ladaai kaa?
 When we are saying, the Election Commission is not saying anything but Azam says the Election Commission takes action
 yahi main poochna chahta hum ki ham vahi baat kah rahe hai or lagaataar kah rahe hai or aaj bhi kah kar aae hai to ham par ection kyon nahin lete hai?
 Question- Your and Azam's methods will be different
 jawaab -ab koi tarika nikaalo lekin baat to vahi kehete hai ham bhi
 Question - You are also being asked nowadays which was said earlier
 moulana mulaayam, samaajawaadee party par booth capchar karaane kaa aarope lagaaya he amit shah ne
 Answer - What is Amit Shah saying and what is Amit Shah? unke bare main kuch bhi bolnaa hi uchit nahin hoga
 This whole country knows
 ye vicitra sthiti he ki amit shah jaise log chunaav incharge banaakar upi main bheje jaaen
 Who does not know Shah how many massacres Amit Shah has committed
 amit shah ke atyaachaar ko maine ankhon se dekha he
 The atrocities on girls and women brought tears to my eyes
 aisa hua tha or ab wo modi pradhanmantri banenge, to desh kaa kya hoga
 Well, if they become, then i can say no
 banenge to bhi unako bahumat nahin milegaa
 The majority is not coming that they are winning 272 seats
 lekin agar mil julkar bahumat aa bhi jaae to vahaan aise log baithe hai ki unako mauka nahin milegaa
 Question - Like who are sitting
 jawaab -ab wo nahin bataaunga, ye sab jaanate hai ummidavaar koi doosraa he pradhanmantri kaa
 Question: Those who are supporters of Modi, they of Corporate India say that we need a man who works for development and who is powerful
 jawaab -gujarat main kitne saal ho gaye unako
 But what have you done there
 dekhie sabase zyada berozegaar noujvaan gujarat ke andar he
 People there are craving for water
 kai jilon main pani nahin he, kya kiya unhone
 In the same way, 37 thousand girls do not know, i do not know where i have gone, i am speaking everyday
 ab wo kehete hai ki mulaayam singh hamaari khufiyagiri kar rahe hai
 37 thousand are missing
 vahaan par kitne log biimaar hai, dawaai nahin he
 If there is a hospital, there is no doctor
 ye haalat he aaj gujarat kii or 21 jilon main pine kaa pani tak nahin he
 Question- They cite that agricultural production is 10% there whereas the whole country is 3%
 gaanv-gaanv main road he or internet bhi he
 Answer - With UP they cannot compete with Gujarat
 vahaan 8 ghante bijli he gujarat main
 No roads, no water, no development, no electricity
 vahaan bade-bade udyogpati hai jo ye prachaar karvaa rahe hai
 This is their compulsion
 sachai ye he ki aap kabhi delygation lekar jaaie tab dekhenge ki kitni bacchiyaan gaayab he
 How many hours does electricity come
 kya vikaas he or pani pine ke liye to aaj ke din bhi jab main bol rahaa hum 21 jilon main nahin he
 What i am saying is telling the truth and therefore Modi saheb is upset that Mulayam Singh is telling the truth
 jhooth bol-bol ke modi ne ye sab kiya he
 6 big industrialists who are billionaires are silent
 unke akhbaar bhi hai jo modi bolte hai vahiin unamem chhapata he
 They are afraid that will make us barbarous, so the industrialists are silent and many industrialists have joined them
 naam nahin luungaa
 i know that personally he has given at least 10 thousand crores rupees
 sawaal -aap ye maanate hai ki sire se nakaarne kaa koi modi bhed he
 Answer - Whatever Modi said about development in Gujarat is absolutely wrong and not equal to UP
 8 ghanta to bijli aati he vahaan or yahaan kehete hai ki puri bijli de rahe hai
 Don't know why everyone is lying and accepting the lie as true
 sawaal -lekin zyaadaatar log to ye maanate hai ki modi taqatvar netaa hai
 Answer - the strength of the fight, will wrestling fight? 
 They know about us when we talk about 56 inches

 i was prevented from coming to Ahmedabad by saying that if you come, then i am not responsible if you lose your life
 mujhe espi ne roka lekin main nahin rukaa
 
 
 i said arrest me, put me in jail or shoot me
 sawaal -pichhali sarkaar kii vifaltaaon kii vajah se log modi se ummid baandhen hue hai
 Answer - There is inflation in the country but inflation in Gujarat is more than UP
 aapke madhyam se modi sahab se bhi ye baat kah rahaa hum ki vahaan mahangaai zyada he, pataa nahin kyon jhooth prachaar ho rahaa he sab jagah
 Question- If you are saying, bjp's numbers will not come, otherwise Congress has a chance
 jawaab -ye sahi he ki congress se logon kii narazgi he
 In the last 10 years, Congress has not done any such thing for the public
 jisase ki wo kah sake ki hamane ye kaam kiya he
 Because of being angry with the Congress, BJP may get its benefit a little bit
 lekin wo laabh unhen akele nahin milegaa
 There are all the parties that will benefit
 jab china hamalaa kar rahaa he tab bhi loksabhaa main wo kuch nahin bole
 i also spoke to Advani ji, say something
 desh bhakthi kii baat karte hai lekin jab china kabja kar rahaa tha meri apil par bhi adwani ji nahin bole
 Question- Every father has a dream and you have a dream come true
 lekin samaajawaadee party ke logon kaa sapana he ki netaji ko piem banataa dekhen
 Answer - i cannot say but our workers are working very hard
 aap jab hamaari sabhaaon ko dekhenge to samajhenge
 The trend of the public is towards the Samajwadi Party
 party jo kahati he wo karti he
 Our government has fulfilled what it promised
 jo bheed ho rahi he usase ummid to bandhati he
 We have told the people to give us strength
 sawaal -agar teesraa morcha kii baat aati he to aapako baahar se samarthan lenaa padegaa
 Answer - We want that a Third Front government should be formed
 kyonki congress or bijepi se janata naaraaz he
 BJP has run the government in the past and has not done any miraculous work
 lekin tisare morche kii devgauda yaa gujral kii sarkaar ne sachai ke saath bahut kaam kiya
 Will see if seat does not come
 ye to nahin kaha he ki ham baahar se samarthan nahin denge, naa ki ham sarkaar main shaamil nahin honge
 Many Congress leaders have said that we will not only support from outside, it means that we also join

 Opening the front against Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi once again, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said in a conversation with NDTV that Modi was also wanted to be removed from the post of the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee after the Gujarat riots, but he could not walk
 
 tippaniyan In fact, after Nitish's slow statement about the secular candidate for Prime Ministerial candidate that came out on Tuesday, the RSS had angrily questioned why the Prime Minister of the country cannot be a Hindutvaist
 sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne sawaal kiya ki kya saare piem secular nahin rahe hai, or kya ab nitish kumaar bataaenge ki piem pad kaa ummidavaar kaisaa hona chahie
 
 
 The udhar, bijepi ne is bayaanbaji main kudate hue kaha he ki narendra modi, atal bihari vaajapeyi or adwani jaise hi secular hai

 Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat questioned whether all pms have not been secular, and will Nitish Kumar now explain what the PM candidate should be like
 
 
 ? On the other hand, BJP has jumped into this rhetoric, saying that Narendra Modi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Advani are just as secular
 bijepi netaa balbir punj ne poocha ki secular hone kii paribhaasha kya he, yah koun tay karegaa

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke media salaahkaar ab unke bachaav main utre hai
 He says that the Prime Minister spoke a lot, he did a lot of work and during his time the country grew
 in baton ke samarthan main vah aankade lokar utre
 Through them, he tried to prove that what he saw was not true
 unhone manmohan singh ko 'vikaas purush' bataaya
 But the media may not have paid much attention to these things, because statistics are deceitful and sometimes a medium of lies
 agar media salaahkaar kii hi baat maan lee jaae, to manmohan singh ne lagbhag 1200 spich die
 Now the question is, who listened to so many speeches and what happened to them? Why did not his voice resonate far away? If he did great things for the good of the villages and farmers, why did he not get the word? There was development in his time, so why is it not being discussed today? There were many occasions in Parliament when he could speak, but he did not speak
 laal kile kii pracheer se to unhen bolne kaa mauka bahut baar mila, phir vahaan kya bole vah? aise kai sawaal zehan main uthte hai
 After all, it is the same Manmohan Singh, whose economic reforms fascinated the people of the country and cheered them
 yah vahi manmohan singh hai, jinke pradhanmantri banane par logon ne harsh jataayaa tha
 He is the same Manmohan Singh, whose honesty was never doubted
 upie 2 ke shasankaal main desh kii haalat main jo giravat ai, uske liye beshak manmohan singh akele jimmedaar nahin ho sakate hai
 Many people and circumstances are responsible for this, but questions will be raised about them, because they were the heads of that government
 agar kisi mantri ne dhang se kaam nahin kiya, to uski jimmedaari to he hi, pradhanmantri kii bhi utani hi jimmedaari he
 If anyone was asked how UPA 2's reign was, the answer would be that it was a failed government
 aankade dekar use mahaan nahin bataaya ja saktaa he or aankade bhi vaise ki logon ko bharamaaya jaae
 Time is ruthless and it does not take long for the king to become a rake
 aaj manmohan singh par waar ho rahe hai or unki party chup he

 'don kaa intjaar to 12 mulkon kii police kar rahi he, magar don ko pakadana mushkil hi nahin naammumkin he'
 This dialogue is from a Hindi film
 gurmeet ram rahim ke jail jane ke baad unki kareebi haniprit jab faraar ho gai to use lekar bhi kuch aisi kahaniyaan gadhi ja rahi thim
 But 'aaj Tak' changed the entire script
 ajtak ke reporter ne wo kar dikhaaya, jo saat suubon kii police bhi nahin kar pai
 Aaj Tak sought Honeypreet and took an answer from him for every question which remained a mere puzzle
 magar, kuch sawaal ab bhi baaki hai
 Honeypreet said in the interview that she went into depression after Baba went to jail
 usne bataaya ki unhen is baat kaa bilkul andaja nahin tha ki 25 agast ko panchakula kivishesh sibiai adalatbaba ram rahim ko rape kaa doshi maan legi
 Since that day, Honeypreet has disappeared from the world and she is still out of the custody of the police
 lekin kya vaaki haniprit depressant kaa shikaar thi yaa phir wo kanoonee shikanje se bachane ke liye sahi maukey kaa intjaar kar rahi thi
 Actually, as soon as Gurmeet Ram Rahim went to jail, there were new revelations every day
 baba ke kaale karnaamon kaa chittha duniya ke saamne aata chalaa gaya
 During this, Honeypreet kept changing her whereabouts
 kabhi wo apane bhakt ke ghar rahi, to kabhi bhai kii sasuraal kaa aasraa liya
 On one side, Honeypreet kept away from the grip of the police and on the other, the police-administration continued to raid other places of Baba from Sirsa Dera
 panchakula main hinsa bhadakaane vaale logon par shikanja kasata chalaa gaya
 But as the matter calmed down, Honeypreet reached Delhi
 25 sitambar ko haniprit ke dilli main hone kaa daawa kiya gaya
 She came to meet her lawyer in Lajpat Nagar and filed an anticipatory bail petition in the Delhi High Court
 haalanki, hai court ne haniprit kii yachika ko khaarij kar diya
 The High Court ordered Honeypreet to surrender in clear words
 ab jab haniprit ke paas punjab-haryana hai court main jane ke alaava koi chaara nahin bachaa he, aise main wo media ke saamne ai
 In the interview given to Aaj Tak, Honeypreet mentioned about going to the High Court

 Politics has also started regarding the encounter of suspected ISIS terrorist in Lucknow and the explosion in rail in Madhya Pradesh
 digvijay singh ke baad ab congress ke duusare netaa satyavrath chaturvedi ne bhi modi sarkaar ko is encounter maamle ko lekar gheraa he
 Congress in Parliament is an attacker on the Modi government regarding this matter
 sansad main rajnath ne diya javabagauratlab he ki upi aties ne lakhanu main aatanki safulla ko 11 ghante tak chale encounter main maar giraaya tha
 Later came the UP ATS statement that the link with ISIS could not be found and this group was carrying out terrorist activities on its own
 rajnath singh ne sansad main isapar bayaan diya or kaha ki saboot ke aadhaar par police ne karrwai kii
 Rajnath Singh also praised the feelings of the father of the slain terrorist Saifullah

 Rajnath's agreement reversed In the Lok Sabha, Home Minister Rajnath Singh gave a statement on the Lucknow encounter on Thursday
 rajnath singh ne kaha ki soochna or saboot ke aadhaar par police ne apni karrwai kii
 Regarding the terrorist connection, Rajnath Singh said that the father of the terrorist himself said that the body of the person who committed treason will not take his body

 What did Digvijay say? Earlier, senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh had also questioned the Lucknow encounter
 digvijay ne kaha ki piem ne kaha tha ki notebandi se aatankwaad khatm ho jayega, lekin kya vastav main aisa hua he? congress netaa ne rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal par bhi tanj ksaa
 After all, why is IS attracting Muslim youths? One needs to think on this
 'ensipi ne bhi kiya samarthanensipi ke netaa maajid memon ne bhi digvijay singh ke bayaan kaa samarthan kiya he or kaha ki ye samvedansheel maamla he or sarkaar ko jaankaree saarvajanik kerani chahie

 sibiai kolkata main rajeev kumaar ke thikaane par chhapemari kii koshish kar chuki he, magar us dauraan kolkata police se sibiai team kii bhidnt ho gai thi or police ne sibiai ke adhikariyon ko hi hiraasat main le liya tha
 The case was also seen as a confrontation between Modi at the Center and the Mamata Banerjee government of the state
 rajeev kumaar ke ghar chhapemari or centre sarkaar ke virodh main pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee centre sarkaar ke khilaaf dharne par bhi baith gayi thim

 However, after the terrorist attack on army camp in Uri and the Doklam dispute on the border with China, the government said that the army will not be allowed to run short of resources
 sah sena pramukh ke is bayaan se ye nahin lagata he ki sarkaar apane vaayadon ke hisaab se kaam kar rahi he
 It will now be seen how the army faces the challenge on two fronts in such a low budget
 gauratlab he ki rajasthan main jat samudaay ko aarakshan 1999 se mila rahaa he, lekin isamen dhaulpur or bharatpur ke jat shaamil nahin kiye gaye the

 Bhurelal, chairman of the monitoring committee set up in Delhi for sealing, has blamed the Delhi government, including the MCD, for the sealing
 unhone kaha ki dilli main badhate avaidh nirmaan or ceiling ke liye dilli nagar nigam (emsidi), dilli deveopment athurity (didie) or dilli sarkaar teenon hi jimmedaar hai
 Recently, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari had accused the Monitoring Committee set up by the Supreme Court that the manner in which the monitoring committee is sealing in Delhi is completely illegal
 vahiin supreme court dwaara dilli main ceiling ke liye banaai gai monitering cameti ke chairman bhurelaal ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki jo kuch ho rahaa he, vah supreme court kii ichha se ho rahaa he
 This committee is not made up of any government
 unhone kaha ki jo aarope lagaae ja rahe hai, wo bilkul galat hai
 Bhurelal said that when we go to the farmhouse, we take action on what is wrong
 jo bhi galat hota he, ham use rokane kii koshish karte hai
 The Chairman of the Monitoring Committee said that the MCD, DDA and Delhi government are responsible for the sealing that is happening in Delhi
 unhone kaha ki ham sarkaar ke kehane par kaam nahin balki supreme court ke kehane par kaam kar rahe hai
 The task of preventing illegal construction is with local agencies, if we get information about illegal construction, then we take action only after conducting an investigation
 gauratlab he ki rajdhani dilli main ceiling par siyasat jari he
 While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accuses the Delhi government of sealing, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) blames the BJP for a permanent solution to the sealing
 congress kii uttar pradesh ikai ne ravivaar ko kaha ki akhilesh sarkaar ek baar phir garibon ko chhalane kii yojana bana rahi he

 UP Congress Committee's media coordinator Ashok Singh said that 8 months have passed since the formation of the Samajwadi Party government
 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan pradesh kii janata se kiye gayi tamaam vaade bas vaade hi banakar rah gayi hai
 The government did not fulfill any promise
 singh ne kaha ki kisaanon kii karj maafee naam par sirf ek bank se liye gayi karj ko maaf kiye jane kii ghoshnaa hui he, lekin isamen lagaai gai sharton se kisaanon ko hi shaayad laabh mili
 Similarly, the promise of free irrigation and electricity is proving sad for the farmers
 naharon main pani nahin he or bijli kaa alam yah he ki gaanvon main sirf taar to latake hai, lekin unamem karant hafton main aata he
 The same situation is with the Lalipap 'unemployment allowance' shown to the youth and the scheme of distributing tablets and laptops to the students
 singh ne kaha ki aaye din pradesh ke mukhyamantri nai ghoshnaaen karte rahete hai
 This is the reason that the cabinet minister of the state government and a senior member of the chief minister's family had to make an unconstitutional declaration of giving a government job to suppress the anger of his own party workers
 singh ne kaha ki pradesh kii janata sarkaar kii niti or niyat ko puri tarah samaj chuki he or kisaanon, naujavaanon, chaatro, pichhadon, daliton, alpsankhyakon ke saath kii gai vaadakhilaphi kii keemat loksabhaa chunaav main chukaani padegi

 ' Virat Kohli (169) and Ajinkya Rahane (147) scored a brilliant century to bring the Indian team in good condition on Sunday, the third day of the Boxing Day Test
 in donon kii bahaduree bhari ballebaaji ke kaaran hi bharat pehali pari main tisare din stamps tak aath wicket par 462 ran banane main safal rahaa
 In this third match of the ongoing four-match series at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), India are still 68 runs behind in reply to Australia's first innings of 530 runs, but with their centuries innings, Kohli and Rahane have given their team confidence, Because of that, they can definitely leave their mark in this match
 tisare din ke pehle satr main murali vijay (68) or cheteshwar pujaara (25) ke jaldi-jaldi out hone ke badakohli or rahane ne chauthe wicket ke lierecord 262 ranon kii saajhedaari kar bharat ko majboot sthiti main pahunchane kaa kaam kiya
 While Kohli scored his third and ninth total in this series, Rahane completed his third century
 rahane ke teenon shatak videshi dharti par lage hai

 dhoni or aswin ko reyon haris ne out kiya, jabaki rahane or rahul kaa wicket nathan leone ne liya
 The game of the third day was entirely in the name of Kohli and Rahane
 apni-apni shatkeey pariyon ke dauraan kohli ko ek or rahane ko do jeevandaan mili lekin ve isse vichlit nahin hue or team ko majbootee pradaan karne kaa kaam jari rakhaa
 Kohli and Rahane executed the first and record century partnership for their country for the fourth wicket at the historic MCG
 kohli-rahane ke bich 262 ranon kii record saajhedaaribharat ne is maidan par ab tak kul 12 test match khele hai lekin isse pehle ek bhi maukey par chauthe wicket ke liye ballebaaj shatkeey saajhedaari nahin kar sake the
 Kohli and Rahane, however, break the myth and have a partnership of 262 runs
 khaas baat yah he ki maujuuda chaar maichon kii siries main teesraa shatak lagane vaale kohli or is saal videshi dharti par teesraa shatak lagane vaale rahane ke bich kii yah saajhedaari kaaphi aakraamak rahi kyonki donon ne chaar se adhik ke ausat se ran batore
 Both of them have executed the biggest partnership for any wicket for India at this ground
 yahi nahin, donon ne asia se baahar bharat ke liye beete 10 saalon main sabase badi saajhedaari kii he
 In the MCG, the record for the largest partnership before was Chetan Chauhan and Sunil Gavaskar, who added 165 runs for the first wicket in 1981
 usee saal bharat is maidan par antim baar jeeta tha
 There has been a century partnership for India on MCG for the first wicket on three occasions

 Earlier on this ground, there was a 117-run partnership for the third wicket between Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid in 2011
 tisare din kuch khaas nahin kar paae pujaara-vijayisase pehle, duusare din kaa khel khatm hone tak pujaara or vijay naabad laute the
 India had scored 108 runs for one wicket at stumps on the second day

 He was caught in the slip at the hands of Shaun Marsh while batting an out-ball from Shane Watson

 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, who was serving a sentence in the fodder scam, was undergoing treatment in Ranchi
 23 may ko dopaher ke baad unhone tivi band kar diya, lunch taal diya or sone chale gaye
 His twitter handle, which was breathtaking, buzzing with his words and his presence, also remained silent after the Lok Sabha election results
 lalu yadav ke liye chintaa kii or bhi kai vajahen hai
 In 1997, he broke the Janata Dal and formed the RJD with 17 mps
 tab se yah pehla loksabhaa chunaav he jab bihar main party ek bhi seat jeetne main naakaam rahi he
 Ironically, RJD is still the largest party in Bihar with 81 mlas in the state's 243-member assembly
 ho saktaa he ki yah darja bhi bahut lambey vakt tak kaayam na rahe
 The voting pattern of the Lok Sabha elections shows that in the Legislative Assembly, it has fallen behind the NDA in 63 of the 81 seats won by the rjd-led Grand Alliance
 inamen mahua bhi shaamil he jo lalu yadav ke bade bete tej pratap yadav kaa nirvachan kshetra he
 In Raghopur, the assembly constituency of Lalu Yadav's younger son Tejashwi Yadav, the rjd's lead over the NDA has become very modest

 Deeply ingrained in that as they know Kapil Dev well, he will always be looking for ways, style and attitude in the character of Ranveer Singh and finally Ranveer It would be well to hold

 vitt mantri arun jetali philhal to dilli chunaav main vyast hai
 But after 20 days, he will stand in Parliament
 bajet dastavej lekar
 The responsibility is to reach the growth of 7-8 percent of this third largest economy in Asia within two years
 lekin aam logon or kaarobaariyon kii najar bajet ke in 8 hisson par hogi-1
 Subsidy? The UPA government has given up petrol and the NDA government has given market confidence to diesel
 yani ab sarkaar petrol-dijal kii keemton ko niyantrit rakhane kii bharpai apane khajaane se nahin karegi
 Except for LPG
 is bare main koi bhi faisla logon ko takalif pahunchane vaala hi hoga
 Because at present, the prices of crude oil are low in the international market, but when they increase, it will directly affect the common people
 haalanki, arthshaastri eendhan hi nahin, khaane or fertilizer se bhi sabsidi kam karne kii vakaalat kar rahe hai
 So that the budget deficit can be reduced
 2
 Budget deficit? Higher government spending and lower income mean budget deficit
 jo pichhali sarkaar ke daur main badhata hi gaya
 Jaitley has the responsibility to reduce it
 ve lakshya lekar chal rahe hai bajet ghaataa kam karte hue 2015-16 main jidipi kaa 3
 6 percent and to 3 percent in 2016-17
 3
 Welfare Reforms? In the budget, it is expected that Jaitley will suggest to improve the world's largest welfare scheme like MNREGA
 akeli isi yojana se 5 karod gharon tak paisa pahunch rahaa he
 Due to this scheme, there has been a decrease in the cases of selling of fields by the villagers during the drought
 lekin is yojana par kharch hone vaala paisa taxperes kaa he
 There is severe corruption in the scheme
 4
 Infrastructure? The Ministry of Finance believes that if India were to grow at 7 percent, it would need an investment of 800 billion
 udyogpati ummid kar rahe hai ki jetali ab bajet ghate ko kam karte hue udyogon kii taraf dhyaan denge
 But Jaitley will probably focus more on infrastructure
 ummid he ki ve march 2016 tak road, rail, bandargah or sinchai vyavasthaaon par kharch ke liye 50 billian dollar se zyada kaa mad rakhen
 5
 manuphaccharing sector?is bajet kaa sabase ahm hissaa hoga yah
 Because this is part of Modi's Make in India program
 sambhav he ki kai sector ko tex main chhot or incentive diya jaae
 This will open the way for increasing job opportunities in the country
 or dhimi arthvyavastha ko raftaar milegi
 6
 guds and services tex?jetali ne vaada kiya he ki ve 1 april 2016 se deshbhar main jiesti yani guds and services tex lagu kar denge
 In December, he also introduced a bill in Parliament, in which he called for the creation of indirect taxes of the state and the Center in a manner that could be called a uniform and rational sales tax across the country
 haalanki, jiesti kaa lagu hona isi baat par nirbhar karegaa, ki jetali rajyon ko hone vaale revenue los kii bharpai ke kitne intjaam karte hai
 In this budget, that compensation is also expected to be announced
 7
 General anti-avoidance Rules (GAAR)? Investors await the implementation of GAAR Rules, as they are designed keeping in mind the companies and investors who send money from tax haven countries like Mauritius to the country
 in rules ko 2014 se hi lagu hona tha, lekin niveshkon main ghabrahat na fail jaae, isliye ise 2016 tak taal diya gaya
 8
 banking riforms?sambhav he ki jetali is bajet main khastahal public sector bainkon ko lekar kuch ghoshnaaen karen
 Especially with their default loans and corporate governance
 pichley maheene ek baithak main sarkari bainkon ke aalaa afasaron ne sarkaar ko suzav diya tha ki ve sabhi bainkon kii ek holding company bana de or usamen sarkaar kii hissedari ko 51 fisadi se bhi kam kar diya jaae
 The 2015-16 general budget is considered to be a cross-section for the Modi government
 modi ne maahaul to bana diya he, lekin nau maheene baad sensex 5 fisadi hi upar he
 If you have a habit of drinking fruit juice daily, change it because two recent researches have revealed that daily consumption can be dangerous for your health
 donon shodh main daawa kiya gaya he ki zeus ko jab dibba band kiya jaataa he to usame bahut zyada maatra main chini hoti he
 In such a situation, you may get addicted to it
 ek shodh main kaha gaya he ki roj do gilaas zeus kaa seven apko ‘sweet tooth’ yani mithe kaa aadi bana saktaa he jisase aapaki bhukh bahut zyada bad jaaegi
 Other research suggests people eat dried fruits
 sookhe falon main taaje falon kii tarah hi antioxident, poliphenol or sabhi poshak tatv hote hai
 According to a report by the Daily Telegraph, both researches have concluded based on their results that the fruit taken five times a day should not include fruit juice
 sookhe fal khaane kii aadat ko badhaava dena chahie
 The first research was done by Bangor University in North Wales
 is shodh ke anusaar, taaje falon ke zeus main bhi chaay ke paanch chammach ke baraabar chini kii maatra ho sakati he kyonki zeus nikaalte samay mithaas kii sandratha bad jaati he
 This is three quarters of the amount of sugar found in a bottle of soda
 isse motopa bad saktaa he or rakt main sharkara kii maatra ko bhi prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Researchers say that fresh fruits should be eaten instead of juice
 mukhya shodhakarta doctor hens-peter cubis kaa kahana he ki falon kaa ras ‘sweet tooth’ yani mithe kii lat ko badha saktaa he
 The second research is by researchers from the University of Leeds
 unka kahana he ki sookhe falon main bhi taaje falon ke baraabar hi antioxident, poliphenol or poshak tatv hote hai
 Research has found that dried fruits can be helpful in combating cancer, cardiovascular problems and metabolic diseases
 yah reshe, vitamin or khanijon ke mahatvapurn strot hai
 Chief researcher Professor Gary Williamson says that people often ignore dried fruits because they think they are not very tasty

 In the whole world, FDI is applicable not on the basis of moral force, but on the basis of number force, whether it is China or any other country
 sansad main vipakshi partiyon ke virodh par unhone kaha, ‘mere bachapan main ek kahawat thi, pandey ji pachhataayenge vahiin chaiyn kii khaayenge
 States which today are opposing FDI
 aane vaale paanch saalon main apane yahaan ise lagu karenge
 Regarding the support given by BSP supremo Mayawati to the Congress in Rajya Sabha, Jaiswal was asked whether it is now considered that the Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party will contest the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh in the year 2014, to which he said that this will only help you So understand that they supported the action that these parties felt was right

 epadiai kaa virodh karne vaale raajnneetik dalon ko aade haathon lete hue jaiswal ne kaha ki jo log epadiai kii sachai jaanate hai, unhone iskaa samarthan kiya
 If a state does not want to apply FDI to itself, then how can you stop other states who want to implement it
 unhone kaha ki 1991 main jab manmohan singh aarthik sudhaar ke liye kaarykram laae the, to sabhi partiyon ne iskaa virodh kiya tha, lekin baad main buddhadev bhattacharya se lekar shivaraj singh chouhan tak sabhi apane pradeshon main aarthik nivesh ke liye duniya bhar ke deshon main chakkar kaat kar rahe the, jabaki vampanthi or bijepi ke yah mukhyamantri lagaataar virodh kar rahe the
 Jaiswal said that as long as the country does not progress, no one is going to benefit anyone
 yadi kisi gharaane ko naaraazgi he, to ve pradhanmantri se milakar apni baat kahen uskaa samaadhaan nikalegaa
 On the question asked about the displeasure of BJP and other parties, he said that since he has nothing left now, FDI has passed from both the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha, so now whatever he has said, keep saying no effect

 rahul ne poocha ki modi ji ne pichley dhai saal main upi ke logon ke liye kya kiya
 What gave employment, did it help farmers, did not
 unhone sirf logon ko line main khadaa kar diya
 No suitboot was put in the line but the rupee lying in the poor man's pocket became paper
 whatsap ne blue tik or dabl tik jaise fitures se kai logon kii musiibat badha di he
 Previously, no one was aware of who you are talking to or whether you are online on any chatting app or Google Talk
 par is ap main aapke online hote hi aapke tamaam contactus ko pataa chal jaataa he ki aapane whatsap yuj kiya he
 Due to the lack of logout option in whatsapp, it is always on and notifications connect to your mobile many times as soon as you connect to the internet
 ham aapako kuch aise tareeke bataate hai jinka yuj karke aap anachaahe whatsap notifications or colls ko band karke invizible rah sakate hai
 In this way, there are advantages and disadvantages to using whatsapp Last Seen Hide feature
 phayda yah he ki koi aapkaa last seen nahin dekh paaegaa
 That is, no one will know when you opened whatsapp
 nuksaan yah he ki aap kisi duusare kaa bhi last seen nahin dekh sakenge
 If you still want to hide it, then go to the Settings of whatsapp and Nobody the last scene option from the Privacy tab
 aise karen states hikepane whatsap states ko hide karnaa chaahate hai to iske liye settings main jaaen yahaan aapako privesi teb milegaa jahaan status par clic karen or Nobody kar den
 Now your status will not be visible to anyone
 aise karen profile photo hidechahte hai ki log aapaki profile photo bhi naa dekh paaen to iske liye bhi settings main jaaen or privesi teb main profile photo ko select karke Nobody kar den
 Now nobody can see your profile photo
 blue tik ko aise karen ofblue tik kai logon ke pareshaani kii vajah bana hua he
 This means that you have read the message sent by someone
 ise hide karne ke liye whatsap account ke privesi opshan main jaaen jahaan aapako 'read Receipts' kaa opshan milegaa
 Uncheck it
 iske baad aap kisi ke massej pard lengen phir bhi blue tik nahin hoga
 But it also has its disadvantage, you will not know whether anyone has read your message or not
 whatsapp force stopvatsap main koi log out opshan nahin he par phir bhi aap nahin chaahate ki yah ap kuch der ke liye aapke jindagi main dakhsandaji kare to ise force stop kar sakate hai
 For this, Android users go to their mobile settings and force stop whatsapp from the app option
 iske baad whatsap ke naa to notification aaenge naa hi koi usapar kol kar paaegaa
 When you have a call for whatsapp, then you open whatsapp, then you will be able to use whatsapp as before

 In addition, the claim of fundamentalist Islamic leader Abu Ismail is being rejected because of his mother's US citizenship

 The real estate bill has passed in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday
 bill main kai saare aise praavdhaan hai, jisko lekar ummid kii ja rahi he ki isse bilders kii manamaani par roak lagegi
 That means we will get direct benefit from you
 lekin khaas baat yah he ki bill ko sadan se dharaatal par aane main abhi kareeb chah maheene kaa samay lagegaa, jabaki is dauraan bazaar main bill ke maddenjar kai bade prabhaav dekhne ko milenge
 Anshuman Tiwari, editor and economic expert of India Today Hindi magazine, says that the world of real estate is going to change in the coming six months
 iskaa laabh na sirf kanjumors ko hoga, balki industry ko bhi growth milegi
 They say - 1) There will be change in the contract, the terms will change before the real estate bill comes, the builders will try to change everything in their contracts with the customers so that the matter does not reach the regulator
 jaahir taur par is kram main sharten badalengi or is disha main paardarshita badhegi
 Its benefit is going to be directly to the customer
 2) bilders ke liye bhi laabhprahub tak real estate bazaar main koi spasht ruparekha nahin hone ke kaaran bilders kii manamaani jagajaahir he
 But it is also true that with the introduction of real estate bill, the builders will also get clarity about the market rules
 sidhe shabdon main kahen to vah kya karnaa he or kya nahin karnaa he yah jaan lenge
 Yes, for this reason they have to remodel their entire business model
 3) makaanon kii ofloding par rahegaa jorbilders kii pehali koshish rahegi ki wo pehle se bane hue makaanon ko jaldi se jaldi bech den
 That is, offloading of houses will begin
 bazaar main bane hue makaanon kii sankhya badhegi or zyada makaan hone kii vajah se abhi makaan kharidne kaa man bana rahe graahakon ko laabh milegaa
 4) a period of recession, prices will come down
 In the next six months, there will be an emphasis on selling more and more houses in the market
 yah mandi kaa daur he is kaaran makaan kii keemton main betahasha kami dekhne ko mil sakati he
 That is, there is no better time to buy a house if there is money nearby
 5) jahaan der ho chuki he, vahaan pojeshan par joryah samay unalogon ke liye bhi laabhpradahone vaala he, jinhen samay se pojeshan nahin mila he
 Because the builders would like all such cases to be settled before the arrival of the regulator and to avoid getting caught in the legal issues

 Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav had a meeting on 6 January
 is meeting main sabhi vipakshi dalon ko nyauta diya gaya
 The issue was to get elections done through ballot paper instead of evms
 lekin sutron kii maane yah mudda keval bahaanaa tha
 The issue was to try to unite all the parties on the basis
 haalanki basapa ne khud ko is maukey se dur rakhaa
 However, it is not yet decided which parties will be part of it if an alliance is formed
 lekin gathbandhan kii sugabugahat uthne lagi he

 *** adhivaktaa or anna hazaare paksh ke sadsy prashanth bhushan ne buudhvaar ko aarope lagaaya ki un par hue hamale ke liye dakshinpanthi samooh shriram sena jimmedaar he
 He demanded that the organization be banned and socially boycotted
 bhushan ne kaha, yah ek aisa sanghathan he jiskaa saamaajik bahishkaar karne kii jarurat he or sarkaar ko is par pratibandh hi laga dena chaiye
 Such organization has no right to exist legally
 unhone kaha, shriram sena apni gundgardee or nihathe logon par bina uksaave ke hamalaa karne ke liye jaani jaati he
 He has an impression he left in Bangalore when he beat up a number of young men and women outside restaurants and pubs
 ve skirt pahanane vaali ladakiyon se marpet karne ke liye jane jate hai
 Referring to the attack on himself, he said that a group of three youths came, one of whom described himself as the head of this organization
 teenon unke chambar main ghuse or un par mukkon or laaton se prahaar kiya
 He said, he was saying something about Kashmir, but he did not bother to discuss anything with me
 bhushan ne kaha ki jis yuvak ko giraftaar kiya gaya he uski pahchaan inderveer ke rup main hui he jo khud ko shriram sena kaa pradesh adhyaksh bataata he
 Appealing to his supporters and well-wishers not to commit violence against any member of the Sri Ram Sena, he said that violence is not the answer to violence
 unhone kaha, in logon ke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai hogi
 One of them has been arrested
 
 
 kanoonee karrwai hogi lekin nishchit taur par sanghathan ke sadasyon ke khilaaf hinsa nahin hogi
 Comparing the organization's methods to Hitler in Germany, he said that strict action should be taken against such elements
 unhone kaha ki hitler kii germany main tufaan par savaar sainik nikalakar har us vyakti se marpet karte the jo unase sahmati nahin rakhata tha
 Such people should be stopped

 An attacker has been arrested, and Prashant Bhushan is taken to the hospital for investigation
 hamalaa karne vaale teenon logon ke namindra verma, arun kumaar auratejindra paal singh hai
 Indra Verma, the youth caught by them, said that he was angry with Bhushan's statement on the Kashmir issue
 sutron ke anusaar prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki yah hamalaa kashmir mudde par die gaye unke bayaan kii vajah se kiya gaya he
 Anna Hazare has strongly condemned those who attacked Prashant Bhushan
 unka kahana he ki kanoon ko haath main lekar aisa kaam nahin karnaa chahie
 Anna said that he would pray that God give good wisdom to such young men
 anna ne kaha ki vah baatcheet kar is hamale ke peeche kaarnon ko janenge or uske baad vah aage kii ranneeti banaaenge
 It is worth mentioning that shortly before Prashant Bhushan, it was advocated to find out through referendum in Kashmir that the people there should be allowed to go wherever they want to go
 (inupat bhashaa se bhi) Bachchan saheb went on to say that his wife Fati is also his big name
 lekin ladke bechaare hai kanphyus ki unke liye moti ladki sahi rahegi yaa nahin
 Do not feel bad, we are not tightening up on anyone
 lekin aapako bataate hai moti bivi ke kuch phaayde or nuksaan:nuksaan:1
 In public, you are shy to introduce him
 ab maniye yaa na maniye, lekin agar aapaki bivi moti he to aap apane friend cirkil main yaa soshal party main khul ke jane se hichkichaate hai
 2
 soch samaj kar baat kerani padati he
 Who knows about time and luck, what should be considered bad
 suna he moti ladkiyaan kuch zyada hi sensetive hoti hai
 3
 badi gaadi kii jarurat padati he
 If the wife is fat, it becomes difficult to walk on a two-wheeler for a long time
 to gaadi kaa kharchaa bad jaataa he lekin bajet choti car kaa ho to bivi kaa sies dekhte hue aapako badi gaadi leni pad sakati he
 4
 bivi moti hogi to phir leji bhi hogi
 Now think about what harm can happen to a lazy wife
 bartan or kapade dhone se lekar dorbel bajane par darwaja kholane tak shaayad sara kaam aapako hi karnaa pade
 5
 furniture majboot khareednaa padegaa
 There is no guarantee that lighter or cheaper furniture will last
 phaayde
 
 
 1
 moti bivi kapadon ko lekar selective nahin hoti
 Here you can breathe peacefully
 unhen samaj hogi kii unki figure par kya suut karegaa
 Their shopping and expenses may not even make you unhappy
 2
 If you are fond of food, then your fat wife does not bother you to eat
 ulta wo to khud aapako company degi
 3
 figure contious ladakiyon ke liye sheesha hi sabase pyaara dost he
 She spends more time with her glass than her husband
 lekin moti bivi ke saath ho ye problem bhi nahin he
 She will give you plenty of time
 4
 It is said that be it a girlfriend or a wife, boys always work as bodyguards for them
 lekin moti bivi to khud aapaki bodyguard hogi
 5
 apane partner ko lekar pojesiveness yaa use kho dene kaa dar kaaphi takalif detaa he
 But if your wife is fat then you will not have this fear
 ab hamane to aapako apana suzav de diya
 You have to decide
 vaise in baton ko dil par lene kii jarurat nahin he kyonki motaa yaa patala shabd apane aap main koi myne nahin rakhata he, yah kisi se tulana par nirbhar he

 India did what India wanted in the valley
 ek jatke main kashmir se dhara 370 hataa di gai or pakistan haath malataa rah gaya
 But the issue is about Kashmir and Pakistan will not sit silent or else it is important to investigate what is the option of Pakistan in response to India
 kyonki jis america kii taraf is masale par pakistan ummid bhari nigahon se dekh rahaa tha
 He bluntly said that this is an internal matter of India
 to phir ab kya karegaa pakistan?pakistan kii paanch dhamkiartical 370 hataane ko lekar pakistani sena se lekar sansad tak
 From Parliament to the government, everyone is restless
 pareshaan hai
 a special session of the Pakistani Parliament was convened in a hurry
 or pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan ne bharat ko dhamkaana shuru kar diya
 He said in Parliament that there would be attacks like Kipulwama
 khun ke aakhri qatare tak ladenge
 Will go to the United Nations
 antarrashtriya court main le jaaenge
 We have an atomic bomb
 pakistani sarkaar par vahaan ke siyasatdanon kaa jo dabaav he, wo saaf nazar aa rahaa he
 But now these threats of Imran Khan are not going to have much effect
 kyonki pakistan ko jis tarah pulavama kaa jawaab balakot main mila
 After that, Imran Khan is also blowing the flame and is repeatedly saying that nothing is going to be gained from the war
 magar jis pakistan kii raajnneeti hi kashmir se shuru or kashmir par khatm hoti he, vahaan is masale par tevar dikhaanaa bhi sarkaar kii majaburi he
 Imran Khan said in the Pakistani Parliament "he has to do something in Azad Kashmir again
" raddimal aayega
 He has to take action
 ye ho nahin saktaa ki pakistan main atake kare or ham jawaab naa den
 They will also answer
 ham bhi jawaab denge
 What if there is a convention war? war hamaare khilaaf bhi ja sakati he
 What will we do if it goes against us? hamaare paas do raste ho jaaenge
 One of Bahadur Shah Zafar and the other of Tipu Sultan
 ek haar maan len yaa doosraa tipu sultan kii tarah khun ke aakhri katare tak laden
 i ask this question, if we fight on the last strand of blood, what war will that be
 "ab ye raddimal bakaul imran khan pulavama hamale jaisaa ho saktaa he
 Overall, the Pakistani Prime Minister is threatening to attack India in response to the abolition of Article 370
 saath hi imran khan ne yahaan tak kah diya ki bharat ke is kadam se kashmir main halaat or kharaab honge
 And it is possible that the situation will become like war
 or agar aisa hua to iskaa asar puri duniya par padegaa
 The tension between India and Pakistan on Article 370 is increasing with each passing day
 bharat sarkaar ke is faisle se tilamilaae pakistan or is mudde par apni hi sansad main puri tarah ghir chuke piem imran ne is immergency halaat ke bich rashtriya suraksha samiti yani enessi kii baithak kii
 In which the three heads of the Pakistani Army were present
 khabaron ke mutabik is baithak main bharat ke is kadam kaa muqabla karne ke liye sabhi mumkin vikalpon par charchaa kii gai
 And it was decided that the Government of Pakistan would launch a diplomatic offensive against India's move
 imran khan ne bharat ke naam ye khuli dhamkiyaan mangalvaar ko bulaae gaye pakistani sansad ke immergency satr main deen
 Where Imran Khan claimed that he had noticed something untoward in Kashmir during the Bishkek conference
 imran khan kii mushkil ye he ki unhen apane mulk ko kashmir main dhara 370 khatm kiye jane par mutmain karnaa he
 At the same time, they are also afraid that if India takes action on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir tomorrow, what path will be left with Pakistan
 imran khan kii baukhalaahat kaa ek badi vajah ye bhi he ki imran khan kii guhaar par donald trump kashmir mudde par madhyasthata ke liye taiyaar to ho gaye the
 But India outrightly thwarted the vicious moves of Imran
 trump kii madhyastha ke vikalp ko nakaar diya
 Now Imran Khan is worried that Section 370 has ended in Kashmir and no one is listening to Pakistan
 kashmir kaa vishesh darja khatm karne ke khilaaf pakistan kii tamaam ummiden sanyukt raashtra or america par tiki hui hai
 But America has already distanced itself from this issue by giving a statement
 america ne is baat kaa sangyaan liya he ki bharat sarkaar ne is kadam ko sakht taur par apana aatanrik maamla bataaya he
 Overall, with the abolition of Section 370 from Kashmir, Pakistan's nefarious expectations of Pakistan have also been eradicated
 pakistan baton baton main yuddh kii dhamkee bhi de rahaa he
 But Pakistan itself knows that now there is no more option left for Kashmir
 or uski charmarai arthvyavastha use jang kii ijazat nahin detii he
 Obviously, the face-to-face battle with India is difficult for Pakistan
 lihaaza ghati ke saath saath hindustan main ashaanti failaane ke liye ab pakistan vahi rasta apnayega jo wo pichley teen dashakon se apanaataa aayaa he
 That is, the path of panic
 or pakistan kii is teror policy kaa zimmaa hoga uske aatank ke 4 ahm numaayindon par
 These include Hafiz Saeed, Masood Azhar, Syed Salauddin and Dawood Ibrahim
 in chaaron ko philhal mulk kii image sudhaarney ke liye underground kar diya gaya tha
 Because wazir-e-azam Imran Khan was to visit the US in July last month
 or vahaan aatank ke masale par wo apni kisi tarah kii kirakiri nahin karana chaahate the
 But now the US tour is over and Section 370 is also in the valley
 lihaaza sutron ke hawaale se ye khabaren aa rahi hai ki pakistani sena or iesai aatank ke in madules ko phir se active kar rahi he
 But Pakistan is probably forgetting that India knows the whereabouts of these terrorists
 hindustan ke paas naa sirf in aatankiyon ke thikaanon kaa pataa he balki balakot jaise airstrike karne kaa experions bhi
 That is, any Pakistani move to spread panic can be overshadowed by him

 '' gauratlab he ki ramdev ne saansadon ko insaan ke bhesh main shaitan bataaya tha
 Anna said, "there is nothing wrong in what Ramdev said

 When the party gives the ticket, why do they give it to the tainted person? "he said," The parties only think about the vote

 jisamen sabase mahatvapurn he purv mukhyamantri rabari devi ko loksabhaa chunaav ke pratyaashiyon ko die jane vaale tikat( simbel) par hastakshar karne ke liye adhikrut kiye janaa
 Actually, RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav is in jail in the fodder scam case
 aise main jail ke andar se party adhyaksh kaa simbel par hastakshar karnaa kanoonee rup se maanya nahin hoga
 Therefore, this responsibility is being assigned to Rabri Devi
 gauratlab he ki argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav jab chaara ghotaale maamle main pehali baar 1997 main jail ja rahe the, tab unhone apane mukhyamantri pad se istipha dekar rabari devi ko bihar kii gaddi saunpi thi
 Now once again, Rabri Devi is being given this responsibility due to Lalu Yadav being in jail
 haalanki lalu prasad yadav ne apane chote bete tejasvi yadav ko apni rajnatik viraasat saunpi he
 He got the post of Deputy Chief Minister in the Grand Alliance government and later he is taking over the RJD organization without any responsibility for the post, but despite this, Lalu Yadav has asked to give this responsibility to Rabri Devi, then the reason behind this is the unity of the party

 sajayaftaa dwaara simbel baantne par lambit he nirnayaargedy shuru se hi is sanshay main thi ki jail main rahane ke dauraan lalu yadav apane ummidavaaron ko simbel alott kar sakate hai yaa nahin
 But political experts believe that the jailer will have to sign the counter if Lalu Yadav's symbol is allotted from the jail
 isse endie chunaav main iskaa raajnneetik phayda uthaa sakati he ki rajd ke ummidavaar bhi jail se hi tay hue hai
 According to the RJD constitution, RJD president Lalu Yadav has the right to appoint anyone as acting president
 haalanki sajayaftaa simbel baant sakate hai yaa nahin, yah nirnay abhi chunaav ayog ke str par lambit he

 The Indian rupee, showing strength to the world's currencies, is not the only symbol of your nationalist boom and if you feel that changing the chemistry of understanding and thinking is necessary for fast economic growth and new jobs in India, then 'make in India' Idea is worth trying
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne laal kile se puri duniya ko bharat main utpaadan ikaiyaan lagane kaa nyotaa dete hue desh ko niryaat kii takat banane kii pukaar lagaai he to sanyogvash, samay unke saath khadaa he
 India needs new investment fuel to start growth engines, while domestic and foreign investors need long-term growth to invest in India
 idhar duniya ko chahie ek aisa nayaa utpaadan centre, jo china se pratispardhaa kar sake kyonki china ab apni deshi iconomi kii taraf mukhaatib he, isliye vakt or jarurat donon hi ‘mek in india’ ke mafik hai
 Saffron and old indigenous urges may not be digested, but weak currency is the real strength in the world of exports and incidentally Indian rupee has become so competitive against the currencies of the world that it is Modi's Make in India dream
 The foundation can be formed
 aarthik udaarikaran kaa nyotaa milane ke baad niveshak bharat ke tat par isliye utre the kyonki yahaan 100 karod kii aabaadi kaa bazaar laharaa rahaa tha, jahaan killat or maang kii bharmaar thi
 The first round of production went to meet consumer demand
 utpaadan main badhat kaa doosraa daur shuru hone se pehle hi mahangaai or mandi ne dhar liya or chunki maang maujuud thi or emport duty behad sasti ho chali thi
 Therefore, India became import dependent as it became self-sufficient in production
 or saamaanya electronics purjon tak ko videsh se mangane laga, natijatan electronics aaj bharat kaa chauthaa sabase bada aayaat he
 With the idea of make in India, Modi is trying to open up India's economic cliff due to which, even after 20 years of liberalization, the share of employable manufacturing in India's GDP is only 17 percent, while China 50 and Malaysia 40 percent GDP
 Factory production comes from
 ‘mek in india’ praasangik idia isliye he kyonki niryaat kii duniya main paracham buland karne ke liye gharelu mudra kii kamajori jaruri shart he
 Incidentally, before Modi reached Delhi, the rupee has plunged into the ghat of devaluation
 dollar ke mukaable rupye kaa maujuuda str tej niryaat kii neenv rakhane ke makul he
 Japan had weakened the strength of the weakening yen in 1960 and dominated the world by the '70s, with exports rising fourfold
 ’70 ke dashak main dakshin korea or taiwan ne bhi yahi rasta chunaa
 In the late '90s China strongly devalued the yuan and in 2009 it became a major exporter from Japan and Korea
 niryaat kii hode main jeet-haar kaa faisla is par bhi nirbhar hota he ki bazaar main pratispardhi deshon main kiski mudra kitni kamjor he
 India is now heavier than China with a weaker rupee under this scale
 modi ke salaahkaaron ne unhen yah jarur bataaya hoga ki 2007 ke baad se chini yuan majboot hua he or rupaya kamjor
 Therefore, India's exports to the global market are now competitive against China
 haalanki china kaa menuphaccharing niryaat bharat kaa das guna he lekin 2007 ke baad se menuphaccharing niryaat main bharat kii growth china se zyada he
 This is the reason why Modi has tried to connect manufacturing and export
 ‘mek in india’ kii raah lambii hi nahin, ghumaavdaar bhi he
 Government's intellectual regulator and Swadeshi of Swadeshi will consider the weak rupee as the weakness of the country
 videshi nivesh par aae din kesaria pehre lagenge
 There will be shame on the special export zone and labor reforms are not to be agreed quickly
 iske baavjood bharat ko niryaat kaa ingine banane kaa vichaar isliye upyukt he kyonki niryaat kii ungali pakadakar hi china main menuphaccharing main nivesh badha jisase growth or rojgaar aae the
 Manufacturing's share of India's GDP has been stable at 16-17 per cent since the 1980s
 pichhali sarkaar ne 2022 tak jidipi main factory utpaadan kaa hissaa 25 fisad karne kaa lakshya rakhte hue aktubar, 2011 main nai menuphaccharing niti ghoshit kii thi, jo kuch khaas kar nahin saki
 It is not surprising that Modi's manufacturing policy should actually become India's foreign trade policy
 narendra modi kii khaasiyat he ki ve jo bakhubi jaanate hai, use bakhubi karte bhi hai
 Gujarat's manufacturing growth is the result of his chief ministership, while Gujaratis have inherited a centuries-old relationship with global markets
 do saal pehle ek kitaab ke vimochan kaarykram main modi ne kaha tha ki ve ahmedabad ko port city banane ke liye khambhaat kii khadi tak ek bada jalmaarg bananaa chaahate hai
 It was conceived in 1894 by Ranchodlal, a famous cloth merchant of Gujarat
 isliye swatantraaa diwas ke agle hi din mumbai main jab modi ne bandargahon ko railway va sadak se jodgaye or rajyon ke bich niryaat kii hode kii jarurat bataai to andaaj ho gaya ki menuphaccharing or niryaat kii jugalbandi ko puri taiyaari ke saath laal kile se aawaaj di gai he

 Praveen Jha said that Girmitiya considers herself an Indian even after six generations
 shuruyaat main jo striyaan girmitiyaa mazaduron ke rup main baahar gayi, unke liye unki mukti pramukh thi, parantu baad main unhone bhi bhartiya samskruti ko bachaane kaa prayaas kiya
 About this book, the author Yatindra Mishra said that every page opens the mind of the writer
 is kitaab dwaara praveen ne itihaas ke vrutt main chhed kar diya he, or jab bhi is vishay par koi shodh hoga to is kitaab ko adarsh ke taur par dekha jaayegaa
 According to Yatindra Mishra, Praveen is an honest, passionate and compassionate writer who reflects through the pages of this book
 malini avasthi kaa kahana tha ki kitaab kaa vishay or sheershak donon hi aakarshith karte hai
 Praveen has touched the psyche of the British of that time
 unka kahana tha ki morishas or fiji main bhartiyata zyaada dikhaai detii he
 If you want to know what you were, then go to Suriname and Trinidad, where the descendants of the Girmitiya people have preserved the original form of Indianness

 During the hearing on the public interest litigation regarding the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple, it has been argued by the Travancore Devasam Board that the entry of women into the mosques is banned
 tab sirf ek janhit yachika ke aadhaar par bina kisi thos daleel ke sirf mandir maamle par hi sunwaayee kyon ho rahi he? kyonki samanta ke adhikaar ke ulanghan kaa maamla masjido par bhi lagu hota he
 With the plea of travancore Devasam Board lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, there has been a new twist in the ban on the entry of women to the Ayyappa Swamy temple in Sabarimala, which is being heard in the Supreme Court
 travnakor devasam board kii taraf se kaha gaya ki rajaswala avasthaa ke dauraan mahilaon kii baat to dur, kai masjidon main bhi to mahilaon ko jane kii ijaajat nahin di gai he
 Singhvi has asked the court that the Shia Muslims of the country bury their bodies with weapons in Muharram
 desh main kaali ke kai aise mandir hai jahaan twachaa main kaante chubhaaye jate hai
 The devotees hang themselves by piercing the nails in the skin
 kya supreme court tarakkee pasand hone ke naate is par bhi roak lagaaegi ?travnakor devasam board ne 10 se 55 saal ke bich kii umr vaali mahilaon ke pravesh par pabandi ko uchit bataate hue kaha ki vahaan kai aisi anokhe reeti rivaaj or vidhi vidhaan hai jisapar hindu hi nahin gaiyr hindu jan bhi aasthaa rakhte hai
 Therefore, on the basis of a public interest litigation, efforts are being made to harm Hinduism
 sabarimala mandir main mahilaon ke daakhile par pabandi ke maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue chif justise deepak mishra ne travnakor devasam board se kaha he ki board sabit kare ki yah pabandi dharmik vishwaas kaa abhinn ang he
 The court has asked whether women become mellifluous only because of menstruation
 Therefore, banning the admission of women in the temple is against their constitutional rights and dignity

 Director SS Rajamouli's film Baahubali greatly reduced the gap between Bollywood and the South Film Industry
 bahubali ke baad se south indian filmon kii lokapriyata north india main badi he
 Bollywood stars are increasingly working in South films
 inamen ajay devgan, aalia bhatta, vidya baalan kaa naam shaamil hai
 Baahubali fame Prabhas made his Bollywood debut with Saaho
 phens ko prabhas ke alaava bhi kai or south indian sitaron ke hindi film industry main kaam karne kaa intjaar he
 But it has been seen that the big superstars of the South shy away from working in Bollywood
 mahesh babu, vijay devarkonda, allu arjuna, vijay, vikram, yash jaise sitaron kii fain folowing sirf south main hi nahin deshbhar main he
 The Hindi version of his films gets excellent viewership in North India
 kyon bollywood filmon main kaam nahin karte south superstars?sawaal ye he ki hindi phens ke bich popularity hone ke baavjood kyon ye sitare bollywood kii filmon main najar nahin aate? mekars ke approach karne ke baavjood ye actors bollywood main entry karne se darate hai
 The answer comes from Prabhas' recent release Saaho
 darasal, riginal actors ke liye bhashaa sabase badi rukaawat he
 Except for stars like Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan, there are very few regional stars who are sharp in Hindi
 View this post on instagramkerala ❤ Sugamaano? :) Photographer - Comrade @rashmika_mandannaa post shared byvijay Deverakonda(@thedeverakonda) onapr 14, 2019 at 5:33am pdtsaho main prabhas ne apane dialog hindi main bole the
 Despite good efforts, Prabhas's Hindi screen looked weak
 kharaab dialog delivery ko lekar unhen trol bhi kiya gaya
 It is possible that other South stars also shy away from moving to another industry due to bad Hindi
 ek industry main staradam or fame paane ke baad sitaron ke liye duusari industry main khud ko sthapit karnaa thodaa mushkil he
 That too when they do not know Hindi
 duusari vajah staradam or rutaba ho saktaa he
 These South superstars, the heroes of their industry, enjoy a special States
 duusari industry main debyue agar flop rahaa to ye unke staradam ke liye nuksaandeh sabit ho saktaa he
 These South Superstars will have to concentrate on the Hindi command and the right project selection in order to settle in Bollywood

 singh ne kaha, poochtacha karne parcompany ke nideshak ne yah sweekaar kiyaaki company ne march, 2015 tak kii avadhi ke liye 2
 94 crore collected service tax, but did not deposit it with the government
 aapako bataa den kiservice tex kisi vyakti dwaara pradaan kii gai sevaonpar lagaaya jaataa he or is tex kaa bhugtan karne kii jimmedaari seva pradaata kii hoti he
 It is an indirect tax as it is recovered by the service provider from the service recipient during the period of his business transaction
 aaj se baahar khaane par aapkocum taxchukana hoga
 The GST rate, which was lowered last week for hotels, has come into effect from today
 iske baad aap chaahe asi vaale hotel main jaaen yaa non-asi, aapako sirf 5 fisadi tex dena hoga
 GST Council has reduced the rate in the last week
 GST Council has reduced GST rates for more than 200 products
 iske tahat parishad ne kai utpaadon ko jahaan 28 fisadi se nikaalkar 18 or 12 fisadi tex slab main rakhaa he
 At the same time, some products have been brought in at 12 to 5 percent
 is dauraan sabase bada badlaav asi or non-asi hotalon main lagane vaale jiesti rate ko lekar kiya gaya he
 Earlier it used to be an 18 per cent rate of return where AC hotels used to attract 18 per cent GST
 vahiin, non-asi hotalo main 12 fisadi tex lagata tha
 On Friday, the GST Council made a big change in this and has given a 5% GST rate on both types of hotels
 haalanki 5 fisadi rate lagane ke baad hotel maalikon ko input tex credit kaa phayda nahin milegaa
 There are some hotels that have to pay more tax, but you still have to pay 18 per cent GST
 agar aap kisi aise hotel main khaanaa khaane jate hai, jahaan ek kamare kaa kiraaya ek raat ke liye 7500 rupee se zyada he, to yahaan aapako 18 fisadi jiesti rate adaa karnaa hoga
 It consists mostly of five star hotels
 yahaan bhi hoga mahangaafive star hotel ke alaava outdoor cataring par bhi 18 fisadi jiesti aapako dena hoga
 In this case, no relief has been given in the tax slab
 haalanki ye log input tex credit kaa phayda le sakate hai
 Hotel owners not happy Hotel owners are not happy with the imposition of only 5% GST on AC and non-ac hotels
 unki naaraazgi is baat ko lekar he ki unhen input tex credit kaa phayda nahin diya jayega
 Can increase the charge In the last days, the hotel owners had also said to increase the charge
 agar hotel maalikon kii taraf se aisa kadam uthaaya jaataa he, to uskaa asar aam aadmi kii jeb par pad saktaa he
 Instead of lowering the GST rate, the common man may have to pay more bills

 The victim was a minor when the incident took place
 peedita or uske parivaar kii tamaam koshishon ke baavjood police ne kuldeep singh senger ke khilaaf cese darj nahin kiya

 Not only this, in April 2018, there were allegations of assault with the victim's father
 iske baad 9 april 2018 ko hiraasat main peedita ke pita kii maut ho gai
 Hearing the death of the victim's father in custody after the beating, the Tis Hazari court said in August 2019 that the victim's father was killed, during which he died on the fourth day of the incident due to injuries at 18 places
 court ne kaha tha ki ye puri sajeesh sirf isliye rachi gai taaki peedita is maamle main apni shikaayat darj na kar paae
 The court also remarked that during the time the police beat up the victim's father, it is clear from the statements of witnesses at the time that Sanger was in contact with the police

 As a result, not only was Kuldeep Sengar arrested, but the BJP also expelled him from the party in August 2019
 yahaan tak ki supreme court ke aadesh ke baad is cese ko dilli kii adaalat main shift kiya gaya
 Now Sanger has got a shock from the court and the Tis Hazari court of Delhi has given the verdict on December 16 and convicted Sengar of rape
 peedit parivaar hameshaa se kahata rahaa he ki jab tak kuldeep singh senger ko faansee nahin hoti he tab tak unhen raahat nahin milegi

 'let me tell you, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday made a sensational allegation that when Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister, Gandhi family used to use warship INS Virat as a' private taxi '
 isse pehle bhi modi ne rajeev gandhi ko ‘bhrashtachari number 1' qaraar diya tha
 During a rally in Delhi, PM Modi questioned the Congress, why the leader in whose name they ask for votes, when they expose their 'misdeeds', why do they become smug? Also accused
 modi ne isse pehle rajeev gandhi par aarope lagaaya tha ki unka ant ‘bhrashtachari number 1' ke rup main hua
 The Prime Minister claimed that the then Government and Navy led by Rajiv Gandhi hosted his family and in-laws and a helicopter was also deployed in his service
 piem modi ne kaha, ‘ienes viraat kaa istemaal ek nijee taxi kii tarah karke iskaa apmaan kiya gaya
 This happened when Rajiv Gandhi and his family went on a 10-day holiday
 ienes viraat ko hamaari samudri seemaa kii raksha ke liye tainaat kiya gaya tha, kintu iskaa maarg badal kar gandhi parivaar ko lene ke liye bheja gaya jo avkaash manaa rahaa tha
 He also claimed that INS remained on the island of Virat for 10 days after taking the Gandhi family
 piem ne sawaal kiya, ‘rajeev gandhi ke saath unke sasuraal ke log bhi the jo italy se aaye the
 The question is whether the security of the country was not compromised by taking foreigners on a warship?
