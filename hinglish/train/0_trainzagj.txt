 If so, my identity as a writer has been introduced by my first novel 'kala Pahar'
 haalanki is 'acchhee' ko hamen apane pathakon par chhod dena chahie
 Because it is not necessary that a work that you like should be done by a reader too
 vastav main yah pathakeey vivek, aswaad or samvedansheeltaa kaa maamla he
 Your favorite author? Who is this and why? Bhagwandas Morwal: i would not say a favorite author, i can definitely tell those writers who have created a writerly conscience and trust in me
 inamen raahi maasoom raza, fanishwarnath renu, shrilaal shukla or premachand rahe hai
 Especially Phaniswarnath Renu, who has been indebted to me like many writers for not knowing how many unseen, unheard circles would not be a part of our literature today if a work like 'maila Aanchal' is not available in Hindi
 ‘mailaa anchal’ or ‘aadha gaanv’ in donon upanyaason ko padhakar mujhamen kaala pahaad likhane kaa saahas paidaa hua
 Whose writing do you like as a writer among your contemporaries? Bhagwandas Morwal: Every writer has his own style
 uski bhashaa he
 He has style
 jitani mehnat se main likhata hum sambhawatah ve bhi utani mehnat karte hai
 Nevertheless, i like the writings of writers whose writings have a broader life vision
 yah jivan drushti aapke anubhavon ke aadhaar par samrudh hoti he
 There are so many layers of Indian society that it takes a whole life to understand them
 vaise bhi lekhan koi kariyar banane kaa madhyam nahin he
 It is a practice that demands continuity
 in dinon aap kya likh rahe hai?bhagavaandas morwal:jaisaaki vidit he abhi salbhar pehle hathras style nautanki kii ek adaakara ko centre main rakhkar meraa chatha upanyaas 'sur banjaaran' aayaa he
 He has got free time to breathe
 vaise in dinon pehle mogul shaasha yaa kahiye mughal hamalavar babar se yuddh ladane vaale pehle desi muslim yoddha hasan khan mewati par pramanik saamagree ekatrit karne main laga hua hum
 i am saying this because i do not find much about Hassan Khan Mewati
 jabaki is ranbankure ne hamamzahabi hone or babar dwaara aamantrit hone ke baavjood uske saath nahin, balki rana sanga ke saath milakar babar ke khilaaf yuddh ladaa or khanvaa kii ladaai main shahid ho gaya tha
 Do you believe that writers of Hindi and Indian languages are getting their share of respect and money? Bhagwandas Morwal: i don't think any writer in Hindi and Indian languages would write for any respect or financial benefit
 yah uske chintan kaa kabhi hissaa rahaa bhi nahin
 Most of the writers are not full-time writers and this is not possible because living with empty writing is very difficult
 achche-khaase khyaati praapt lekhakon ko milane vaali roylty ke charche aksar hamen sunne ko milte rahete hai
 In such a situation, talking to a writer about earning from writing is just a matter of recreation
 vaise bhi lekhak kii haisiyat aaj uske lekhan se kam uski jati, uski prishthbhumi, uske rajya, uske kshetra ke saath-saath duusare kaarnon se tay hoti he
 The situation is that every other person who knows Hindi is a writer today, in such a situation it is very difficult to conclude that whom you consider a writer
 nae lekhakon ke liye kya sikh he?bhagavaandas morwal:main abhi is laayak nahin hua hum ko kisi ko koi sikh de sakuun
 i myself am going through the process of learning

 Tulsi Gabbard, the first Hindu MP elected in the US Senate almost five and a half years after the commencement of Hindu prayer, has sworn in as a witness to the sacred Hindu scripture Gita
 tulsi democratic party se america pratinidhi sabha ke liye nirvaachit hui hai
 Raised in a multi-ethnic, multicultural, and multi-religious family under the supervision of a Hindu mother and Catholic father, 31-year-old Tulsi is an American citizen of Samoa origin, an independent country in the South Pacific Sea
 unhone hinduon ke pavitra dharm granth 'bhagavad gita' ko sakshi maanakar guuruuvaar ko pad kii shapath lee
 She is the first member of the US Congress to do so

 But the swearing of Tulsi took place without any hindrance

 Tulsi is not of Indian origin, but she adopted Hinduism as a teenager

 She has previously served in the Honolulu City Council
 shapath-grahan ke baad tulsi ne kaha, 'maine bhagavad gita kii apni nijee prati ke saath shapath lene kaa nirnay liya, kyonki isane mujhe sevaabhaavi netaa banane kaa prayaas karne or apane desh tathaa anya kii seva karne ko lekar jivan samarpit karne ke liye prerit kiya he

 Therefore, only scrutiny will not work
 jab tak sabhi chaatr-chaatraon kii utar pustika kaa purnamoolyankan nahi ho jaataa he, tab tak bijepi chup nahi baithegi

 Let us tell you that on Saturday, Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party Supremo announced the alliance, but the Congress has been kept out of it
 shanivaar ko uttar pradesh main hue gathbandhan se baahar hone ke baavjood congress ke varisht netaa or purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ko ummid he ki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle upi main phir se gathbandhan hoga, jisamen congress ko bhi jagah mil sakati he
 During the talks on SP-BSP alliance, Congress leader Chidambaram said that maybe it is not a final alliance
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle is par punarvichaar ho saktaa he
 a truly broad-based alliance will be formed in Uttar Pradesh
 iske baad bhi agar jarurat padi, to congress apane dam par chunaav maidan main utregi
 At the same time, during the interaction with the media in Dubai, Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party have full right to form alliances
 akhilesh yadav or mayawati ko apni icchaanusaar faisle lene kaa bhi puraa haq he
 As far as we are concerned, the Congress Party will contest elections on its principles and surprise everyone
 haalanki hamaare dil main mulaayam singh yadav, mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke prati apaar sammaan he
 Given the current situation, there are clear indications that before the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress will try to form an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, but if it does not succeed in this, then it will move on the strategy of 'ekla Chalo'
 aapako bataa den ki shanivaar ko lakhanu main samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav or bahujan samaaj party supremeo mayawati ne uttar pradesh main gathbandhan kaa elaan kiya tha
 In a joint press conference, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati said that the two parties had agreed to field candidates for 38-38 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, while Amethi and Rae Bareli were left with 4 Lok Sabha seats

 inke kaarnon par main nahin jaaoongaa, kai achche ho sakate hai to kuch kharaab bhi ho sakate hai
 i am not saying that the ban on media entry into the Delhi Secretariat is such a big issue, which i have mentioned
 media ke camaron se koft vaazib bhi he sawaalon se salbhar tak parhez aapkaa jaij haq he
 Arvind Kejriwal's speech is praiseworthy, in which it was said that there is no boasting
 yah bhi sach he ki pichley saal jab arvind kejariwal shapath lekar dilli sachivalay pahunche the or saikadon camere badhavaasee kii haalat main unke peeche lage the
 i felt very bad then
 gussa aayaa apane media ke sahakarmiyon par ki ham sabhy tareeke se kaam kyon nahin kar sakate hai
 a year later Arvind Kejriwal came back with an overwhelming majority
 janata ne sawaal poochne tak ke liye vipaksh bhi nahin diya, lekin ham apane tareeke main badlaav karenge nahin to pabandi to jhelni hi padegi
 On Saturday, the entry of the media was banned
 The new media advisor Nagendra Sharma said that some way will be removed on Monday
 ham sadakon se kawarej or khabaron ke liye press note kaa intjaar karne lage
 Several rounds were talked about till Monday evening, the government was also given the option that if there is a problem with the camera, then it should be confined to the media room
 keval manyata praapt patrkaar yaa jinke paas manyata nahin he unhen paas banavaakar jane diya jaae
 But there was confusion in the government
 upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya jab media room main aae to kuch patrakaron ne unase chikhakar media ke entry bain par sawaal poocha or vah shaleenta se uthakar chale gaye
 Nagendra Sharma later said that his most powerful minister was abused
 ab jaise chal rahaa he, vaise hi chalegaa media ko entry katai nahin denge
 We have been given a mandate by the public for five years, we will be accountable to that, when he was talking to me, a statement of a British leader was circulating in my mind, when America and Britain made up their mind to attack Iraq
 Then she named it Hubris Syndrome
 jo bush-blair or shakti ke nashe kaa gathjod tha
 The government should be answerable to the public
 vaise bhi media kisi bhi achche kaam ke liye nahin jaani jaati he dallali, makkaari or ped news ke liye shaayad zyada badnaam ho gai he
 Arvind Kejriwal had given many arguments during the last year to the public
 nagendra sharma aap aise hi media par pabandi rakhen
 But perhaps sitting beside journalistic ministers, drinking tea, saving mobile numbers, being blessed with folded hands or exclusive tick-tacks is not the name
 haa, yah baat alag he ki ham inhen chashmon se aaj ke patrakaron ko zyada dekhte hai
 Just as you strengthened democracy by giving signs of simplicity and honesty in politics, by banning the entry of media, you have caught the razor in the hands of those who are notorious for cutting the neck of truth
 abhinetri karishma kapur or unke pati sanjay kapur ke bich talaak bhi shaayad ab aapasi sahmati se nahin ho paaegaa

 karishma or sanjay ke talaak kaa cese donon kii aapasi sahmati se court main tha or ise bollywood kaa sabase mahangaa talaak kaa cese bataaya ja rahaa tha
 Karishma's lawyer said that Sanjay did not fulfill the financial commitments on which the divorce petition was filed in the court with mutual consent
 is vajah se karishma ne nai yachika daayar karkesahmatiki pehle valvepil waapas le lee he
 The case is going on with allegations and counter-allegations as Sanjay's lawyer has also said to withdraw the appeal of mutual consent

 The government will set up a state-of-the-art center to deal with cybercrime
 is centre ke jariye child pornography or online utpeedan ke maamalon se nipta jayega
 The initiative is being taken after the report was submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs by an expert committee constituted to prepare a roadmap towards effectively dealing with cybercrime

 yuvaraj singh ko to bhuule nahin honge aap or naa hin unke pita yograj singh kaa vah bayaan, jisamen unhone yuvi ko world cap kii team naa chune jane ke liekptain dhoni ko jimmedaarteharaya tha
 So the issue is that Dhoni has opened his tongue after a long time
 world cap main ab tak ajey rahi team ke captain ne kaha he ki fielding ke nae niyamon ne yuvaraj singh jaisaa gendbaaj chin liya
 Significantly, in the 2011 World Cup played in India, Yuvraj Singh was the Man of the Series and scored many runs with the bat
 haalanki chaar saal badakptain dhonika maananaa he ki nae niyamon se yuvi jaisaa gendbaaj ab bahut zyada prabhavi nahin rahaa
 On the other hand, there is apprehension that a round of controversies will not start on this statement of Dhoni
 dhoni ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki fielding ke nae niyamon (30 gaj ke ghere ke baahar keval chaar fielder) ke kaaran bharat ko yuvaraj singh jaisaa upyogi gendbaaj ganvaana padaa
 Dhoni was answering the question whether Suresh Raina can play Yuvi in 2015, which was played by southpaw Yuvi in the 2011 World Cup
 team india ke captain ne kaha, 'aapane dekha hoga ki niyamon main badlaav ke baad yuvi ne bahut adhik gendbaaji nahin kii
 We admit that his bowling was affected after the change in rules, although he is a regular bowler in T20s
 'dhoni chaar fielderon ko 30 gaj ke ghere se baahar rakhane ke niyam ke kabhi samarthak nahin rahe, kyonki unka maananaa tha ki unke kai part time gendbaaj jaise ki sachin tendulkar, virendra sahvaag badali hui paristhitiyon main adhik prabhavi nahin rahe
 He said, 'until this was not the rule of fielding, then bowling was handed over to Viru Paaji, Sachin Paaji and Yuvi and we depended on them, but they were all part time bowlers and bowled for them on a wicket suited to batting
 It would have been difficult to do
 'dhoni ne kaha, 'isi tarah se yadi wicket se kuch madad milti he, to raina acha vikalp hai
 He bowls well for left-handed batsmen
 mujhe laga ki ireland ke khilaaf match ke dauraan mujhe unki jarurat he
 Similarly, Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma are also part time bowlers, but i use them only after looking at the circumstances

 com / ldl7pvdg5b Have you ever thought that a Test match should be played until its result
 aapane nahin sochaa to koi baat nahin
 The ICC has thought so
 isisi ke siio harun logrt ke mutabik 2013 main yojit hone vaale world test championships kaa final match timeles test ho saktaa he
 That is, it will continue till the result of this match
 logrt ke mutabik test kii world championships kaa final agar drow rahata he to phir world champion team par ek raay nahin ban sakati isliye test kaa nateeja nikalnaa jaruri he
 However, no final decision has been taken in this direction yet
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki jammu-kashmir main pehali baar hue khand vikaas parishad (bidisi) chunaavon main hue baari matdaan kaa shrey rajya ke vishesh darje ko khatm karne vaale faisle ko jaataa he
 He wrote in a tweet, 'thanks to the decision of the Indian Parliament, young and passionate people's representatives will now shape the fate of the people of all regions of Jammu and Kashmir
 ' jammu-kashmir main pehali baar hue bidisi chunaavon main guuruuvaar ko record 98
 The turnout was 3 percent
 is dauraan 27 pratyaashee nirvirodh chune gaye, jinamein 22 bhartiya janata party ke hai
 The Congress, National Conference and PDP have boycotted these elections
 i congratulate all those who have emerged victorious in the BDC polls across Jammu, Kashmir, Leh and Ladakh
 This marks the dawn of a new and youthful leadership across the regions, which will make a monumental contribution to national progress in the times to come
 pradhanmantri ne ek anya twit main kaha, ‘main jammu-kashmir par aitihaasik nirnay ke liye ek baar phir dalgat str se upar sabhi saansadon ko badhai detaa hum
 The Indian Parliament would be proud that due to their historic decision in August this year, the people of Jammu and Kashmir could exercise their democratic rights with unprecedented enthusiasm, which appeared as a historic 98 percent turnout without any violence and disruption
 ' unhone kaha, ‘mujhe yah bataate hue khushi he ki jammu-kashmir, leh or ladakh main bidisi chunaavon behad safalataa ke saath sampann hue
 There was no violence
 ye loktantr main logon ke atoot vishwaas ko darshata he
 ' shashaank manohar ke netritv vaali antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) ne bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ko chetavanee dete hue kaha he ki vah apni vaarshik aay main se bisisiai ko die jane vaale ansh main se 2016 tii-20 vishwa cap ke dauraan mili tex chhot kaa hissaa ghataaegi
 BCCI officials are shocked at this and have questioned Manohar's move as Manohar was the chairman of BCCI during the T20 World Cup
 bisisiai ke ek senior adhikari ne ieenes se kaha ki bharat main jab 2016 main tii-20 vishwa cap khelaa gaya tha tab manohar bisisiai ke adhyaksh the or vah bhaleebhanti jaanate hai ki bharat main tex niti kis tarah se kaam karti he or ab yah behad kharaab he ki isisi chairman ne is mudde par bhartiya board kii taraf alag rukh akhriyaar kiya he
 The official said, "shashank knows this much better than the rest of the ICC because he was the President of the BCCI during the 2016 T20 World Cup played in India hosted
 ' unhone kaha, 'aap is baat ko nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate ki jab bisisiai isisi se revenue kaa bada hissaa le rahi thi tab kai tarah ke samjhaute hue the
 "he made some changes in the revenue model, but he had no impact on India," the official said
 agar australia ko yah kaha ja saktaa he ki vah tex chhot ke liye sirf sarvshereshth tareeke nikaale to bisisiai ko puri tarah se tex main chhot dene kii kya jarurat he
 'another official said that the ICC chairman should memorize his entire talk before taking a decision on the issue
 adhikari ne kaha, 'us samay shashaank manohar ne vidarbha cricket sangh ko vishwa cap ke dauraan mahilaon ke match or anya match yojit karaane ke liye ek nishchit rakam dilaai, jabaki unke liye isaki jarurat bhi nahin thi
 He managed to get maximum benefit in the entire transaction and now he should rethink his position
 'ek or adhikari ne kaha ki agar isi tarah kii chijen jari raheen, to sadsy vikalp kii taraf dekhnaa shuru kar denge
 He said, 'ICC has become an institution that has no direction and if they are not careful, the cricket world can think of different things
 ' Sources in the government have said that except Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), the situation is peaceful in 42 central universities of the country
 yahaan tak ki in vishvavidhyalayon main parikshaayen bhi nirdhaarit kii ja rahi hai
 According to information received from the Ministry of Human Resource Development, there have been violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act from different parts of the country
 lekin, desh main 42 kendriya vishvavidhyalayon main se kuch hi main candal lite march jaise shantipurna virodh pradarshan hue
 Reports of violence came in only two universities, including Jamia Millia Islamia University and Aligarh Muslim University
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ke ek adhikari ne jamiya kii ghatana kii ucch-stareey jaanch kii maang ke bare main puche jane par kaha ki mantralay ko is tarah kaa anurodh milanaa baaki he
 The Ministry has received a report from Jamia about the incident on 15 December
 sarkaar ne vishvavidhyalay kii kaaryakari samiti dwaara liye gaye prastaav ke bare main ucch stareey jaanch kii maang kii he

 american fishan brands Fossil ne bharat main apane letest smartwatch linep ko pichley saal disambar ke maheene main launch kiya tha
 During this time the company launched its 7 new touchscreen smartwatches
 is dauraan company ne apni Fossil Gen 4 smartwatch Explorist HR ko bhi launch kiya tha
 The company launched it with the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 platform
 isaki keemat bharat main 21,995 rupee rakhi gai he
 We have used this smartwatch (device name-k719) for a long time and now we are passing the review to you
 disple, dizin and bild quality:hamen rivyuu ke liye jo verient bheja gaya he smoki grey color verient he
 Talking about its look, as soon as you get it out of the box, you will get an idea of the premium quality of this watch
 yani jis tarah ke steneles steel kaa yuj kiya gaya he or ise phinishing di gai he, ye aapako premium hone kaa ahsaas degaa
 Especially because Fossil Tech is a designer brand even before it was a brand
 aise main watch kii luk par aap bharosa kar bhi sakate hai
 Talking about built quality, this watch will not bother you while wearing it from anywhere
 khaastaur par jahaan rhite said par said buttens die gaye hai ye bhi aapke haath mud jane ke dauraan aapako pinch nahin karte hai
 There are three side buttons here that you can use
 watch main back kii taraf sensor bhi maujuud hai
 Talking about the screen of the watch, it is quite bright and also very smooth
 aapako yahaan screen yuj ke thik bhi lagegi or dial pahanane ke dauraan bada bhi nahin lagegaa
 You can also set the brightness according to your convenience
 disple yani dial ke luk ko aap is watch ke phase ko change kar bhi unic bana sakate hai
 Here you will find many patterns and designs
 conection:is watch ko conect karne ke liye aapako play store se Wear OS kaa ap downlod karnaa hoga
 After this, the new watch has to be started and connected to this app
 yadi conect karne main dikkat aae to aap ek baar apana bluetooth check kar len or iske baad bhi koi dikkat aae to settings > system main jaakar watch ko reestart kar len
 Features and Performance: Here we will talk about all the parts of performance
 yahaan ham aapako software, hardware samet iske fitures or yuj hone ke tareeke tak saare pahaluon par baat karenge
 First of all, its features and connectivity options, it has the support of GPS, wi-fi and NFC in addition to Bluetooth
 khaas fitures kii baat karen to ye swimpruf he or isamen heart rate trekking feechar maujuud he
 Also, because of being a smart watch here, you will get the feature of Google FIT exclusively
 iske alaava play store, ap notification, translator, reminder, stopwanch, timer, alarm, contact or flashlite jaise fitures bhi milenge
 With the flashlight feature, the screen of the watch can be used as a flashlight in the dark
 ye saare fitures smartwatch or smartphone donon se alag-alag control hote hai
 Google Assistant is also supported here
 kuch or bache hue fitures kii baat karen to yahaan diarect contact acces or find maay phone kaa opshan diya gaya he
 Among these features, the special Find My Phone will definitely work when you have forgotten to put your phone somewhere
 yahaan ek keval ek batan tap karne se aapkaa phone yadi silent mod main hoga tab bhi ye ring karne lagegaa
 As far as contact is concerned, you can search and call contacts from the watch itself
 ap notifications kii baat karen to yahaan aap watsap jaise chat ap se massej pard riplai bhi kar sakate hai
 On the other hand, if you talk about the three side buttons present here, you can customize them
 bich vaala haalanki single clic par ap dravar ko launch karata he or hold kar rakhane se google assistant ko active karata he
 The special thing about this watch is that there is also a microphone in it, so it also takes voice commands for assistant
 isamen maujuud GPS kii vajah se aap phone ko ghar main bhi chhodkar ja sakate hai or ye google feet par aapke work out kaa data store kar legaa
 Also, 4GB of inbuilt storage is also provided in this smartwatch
 isaki madad se aap yahaan kuch gane bhi store kar sakate hai, jiske baad phir smartwatch ko ghar main hi chhodkar bluetooth yearphone kii madad se workout ke dauraan gane bhi sun sakate hai
 Talking of the wear OS present in the watch, the watch received several updates after it was given for review
 final apadet ke baad hamane ise h system varjan ke saath vier oes varjan 2
 Used at 3 saath hi isamen 1 farvari 2019 kaa security ptch bhi tha
 Talking about the software overall, there is some problem regarding net connectivity
 duusari baat aap saare kaam is watch ke jariye nahin kar sakate aapako smartphone par nirbhar hona padataa he
 The design of the OS is fairly easy to watch
 yani jab upar kii taraf swip karenge to aapako saare notifications najar aaenge, neeche kii taraf karne par general settings, left se rhite kii taraf aapako time, wedar, nevigation or kot samet kai jaankariyaan milengi
 At the same time, swiping from left to right, you will get the data of Google Fit
 google feet kii baat karen to yahaan aapako fitness related saare task, chalange or dheron sports ke liye fitures milenge
 Always on display is also present in the watch which is better
 saath hi aap isaki screen ko lock bhi kar sakate hai
 Talking about the hardware, it is based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 platform
 jabaki kwalkom ne nae plaform 3100 kii ghoshnaa bhi kar di he to yahaan kuch dikkaton kaa hamen saamana karnaa padaa
 Many times we felt very lagged while taking net connectivity from the hotspot, or while accessing or downloading an app
 iske alaava kai baar watch puri tarah se krash bhi hua
 In such a situation, there is a great need to improve it
 bydaree:sabase wyk point is watch kii bydaree hi he
 You will get only 1 day battery here
 zyada yuj karne par ye time or ghat bhi saktaa he
 If you want, you can turn on the power saver, but after that you will be able to see only the time on the watch
 shuruuaat main bydaree kii sthiti or bhi kharaab thi, lekin kuch apadats ke baad sthiti thik hui
 One of the positive points of the battery is that fast charging has been given in it, which is really amazing
 baaki vier oes par aap bydaree kii timming or yuj dekh sakate hai
 We also called the battery disappointing because Huawei recently launched a low-cost smartwatch with a battery of up to a week
 aise main jahaan baaki companiyaan do hafte kii bydaree de rahi hai vahaan keval ek din yaa isse bhi kam bydaree kaa hona kaaphi niraashajanak he
 Verdict: Now the question is, do you buy it? If you want a waterproof smartwatch that also works for your fitness tracking and which is quite stylish, then you can buy it
 lekin agar aap stylish luk se kahin zyada powerful parformens or top class bydaree byaap chaahate hai to main ise aapako rickmond nahin karuunga

 arjuna kapur apni maa ke behad kareeb rahe hai
 He died of cancer in 2012
 arjuna jab 12 saal ke the tab unhone apni maa ke liye ek poem likhi thi
 Suddenly Arjun finds a hand-written poem for his mother
 arjuna ne ek imotional note ke saath ye kavita soshal media par phans sang share kiya he
 Not only this, he has also shared childhood pictures taken with his mother
 arjuna ne post share karte hue likhaa- ye poem mere haath lagi jo maine 12 saal kii umr main apni maa ke liye likhi thi
 This was my purest form as a child
 isi dauraan mujhe unase pyaar or lagaav kii anubhuti hui thi or is kavita ke jariye maine ise darshane kii koshish kii thi
 i love him dearly and miss him every morning
 ab mere paas ye kubul karne ke alaava koi doosraa vikalp nahin he ki main unhen or pyaar nahin kar saktaa
 View this post on instagramfound this handwritten poem of mine pardon the handwriting though
 
 
 i wrote this for Mom when i was 12 years old
 It's maybe my most purest moment as a child where i felt loved & wanted to thank her for the love she gave me
 i miss her love, I’m vulnerable every morning without it
 i didn't have a choice but to accept that i wouldn't have her love anymore
 
 
 on most days it feels unfair & it bothers me, it consumes me i feel lost & helpless
 
 
 
 I’m just writing this as a son & nothing more
 i wish i could hear her call me Beta one more time
 
 
 i miss her all the Fucking time & it makes everything seem irrelevant more often than not
 
 
 i broke 8 years back
 
 
 now i wake up trying to fix myself every morning smile at life but honestly that vacuum shall never cease to exist
 i don't know why I'm venting but i guess life takes a toll on us because we are human & i confess i am no hero, i am no different it takes a toll on me too
 
 
 Miss you Mom hope ur happy wherever you are
 
 
 Love You the mostest

 Rahul Gandhi took a journey from Deoria to Delhi with the issue of farm loan waiver in UP
 kisaanon se maang patr bharwaaye
 Also met Prime Minister Modi on this issue
 chunaav se pehle sapa se gathjod ke baavjood party aundhe munh gir padi
 On the other hand, the Yogi government, which took power in UP, has decided to waive up to one lakh loans of small and marginal farmers in the first cabinet meeting
 akhilesh yadav se lekar tamaam congressi netaaon ne bhi yogi sarkaar ke is faisle kii aalochana kii
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala himself called it cumin in the camel's mouth
 karjamaafee ke is faisle par rahul gandhi bhi khamosh rahe or na hi unke aadhikarik soshal media acounton par koi pratikriya dekhne ko mili
 When Rahul reached Parliament on Wednesday morning, the media asked him questions on the debt waiver
 tab unhone muskuraate hue kaha ki kuch der rukiye
 Three minutes later, Rahul's official Twitter handle received three tweets
 twit main unhone kaha ki yeanshik karj maafihai lekin yah sahi disha main uthaaya gaya kadam he
 He also wrote that he is happy that BJP was forced to take this step
 ab aage jarurat he ki bijepi puure desh ke kisaanon ke dard kaa khyaal kare
 Rahul's changed political strategy His response to Rahul Gandhi's waiver by the Yogi government is giving a different political signal
 ab ve sirf virodh ke liye modi or bhaajapa kaa virodh karte nahin dikhnaa chaahate
 Want to appear in the role of a rather positive opposition
 isse pehle rahul gandhi or congress kii ranneeti main har mudde par modi or bijepi kaa virodh hi sarvopari rahata tha
 Aaj Tak had already done the strategy
 It is worth mentioning that Aaj Tak had already told you that all the leaders had asked Rahul to change the strategy after the big defeat of UP elections
 khud rahul gandhi ne bhi mana tha ki ve is bare main gambhirtha se vichaar karenge
 Aaj Tak was told by sources close to Rahul Gandhi that he is now going to make three important changes in the strategy
 1
 Modi and BJP opposition should be stopped on everything
 party kii bhoomika se janata main sandesh jaae ki congress sakaaratmak vipaksh ke kirdaar main he
 2
 jaldi hi sanghathan main badlaav kar use durust kiya jaae
 Get your talk firmly down to the bottom
 3
 In the basic policy of the Congress, it is a priority to be seen as inclusive instead of appearing as a party of a particular religion
 janata ke bich yahi chhavi barkaraar rahani chahie
 In such a situation, after the change of strategy, Rahul's latest reaction to the decision of farmers loan waiver is also being seen in the same political context
 duusare badlaav kii baat khud ve hi kehete hai ve party ke sanghathan main badlaav karenge
 On the other hand, Rahul Gandhi says that the third change will be seen in time
 kul milakar kaha jaae to rahul ab badali ranneeti ke saath siyaasi maidan main phir modi sarkaar se loha lene ko taiyaar hai
 However, the challenge before them is to implement the strategy on the ground and connect the public with themselves
 jisamen rahul gandhi apekshaakrit safalataa nahin paa sake hai

 Having won the general election, the BJP is now eyeing the state elections
 maharashtra ko bhi upi kii tarah fatah karne kaa plan bijepi bana chuki he
 The new BJP president Amit Shah was made the head of the organization just before the elections
 uttar pradesh main amit shah ke kaamyaab formule ko maharashtra main bhi aajamaane kii taiyaari ho rahi he
 Amit Shah should pay more attention to Maharashtra elections, for this the core committee of Maharashtra BJP will meet Amit Shah on July 15

 The quarrel between Narendra Modi and Praveen Togadia began in 2003
 tab donon ne nijee taur par ek duusare par vaicharik vishwasghaat kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 But the reasons behind this split were more personal
 haalanki donon hi yah maanane ko taiyaar nahin the
 By then, it had been one and a half years since Modi became the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 peshey se sarjan togdipha ne 1984 main modi ke saath kaam kiya tha
 When Modi was an RSS pracharak in Ahmedabad district, his relationship continued
 modi 1986
 Togadia became the head of the Gujarat branch of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) in 87 and joined the BJP around this time
 donon ne milakar rajya main bhaajapa ko badhaane main ahm bhoomikaayen nibhaai
 The first disagreement between them publicly surfaced in 1998
 togdipha ne us vakt mukhyamantri keshubhai patel kaa samarthan kiya
 While Modi was against him
 is anban ko haalanki baad main sulajhaa liya gaya
 But when Modi became Chief Minister, it became clear that Togadia and VHP would be marginalized under his rule
 isse togdipha ke man main katutaa panpane lagi or modi ke saath unka manmutav or bad gaya
 On the 16th of January, VHP president Togadia went missing for a full day in Ahmedabad
 ve sadak kinare behoshee kii haalat main mili or unhen aspataal main bhartee kiya gaya
 His blood sugar was low
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki unhen agava kar liya gaya tha or iskaa farmaan dilli se aayaa tha
 He also claimed that he feared he would be murdered
 ahmedabad police ne jedplus suraksha se las togdipha ko kisi bhi tarah kaa khatra hone se inkaar kiya
 Senior leader and RSS spokesperson Manmohan Vaidya also made fun of Togadia's story with those who have differences with Modi
 vaidya ne poocha ki unhen agava karne vaale unki suraksha bandobast se aakhir kaise batch nikle
 Other RSS people also expressed similar doubts
 haal ke dinon main aresas ko bhi togdipha ke saath mushkilen pesh ai hai
 It is said that an attempt was also made to remove him from the rank of VHP president
 par togdipha ne alag dhada banane kii dhamkee di
 Perhaps after sensing Togadia's rebellious attitude, Hardik Patel and former Gujarat Congress President Arjun Modhwadia went to meet him in the hospital
 sutron ke mutabik
 In 2016, senior BJP leaders tried to strike a reconciliation between Modi and Togadia
 par modi anicchhuk jaan padate the
 Perhaps the RSS will now take up this task

 Iraq's dictator Saddam Hussein spent his last days listening to songs by American singer Mary J
 Blige, eating muffins and telling stories to American security personnel in prison
 unhone surakshakarmiyon se dosti ganth lee thi
 Will Bardenwerper's new book, 'the Prisoner in His Palace: Saddam Hussein, His American Guards, and What History Leaves Unseed', brings the experience of American security personnel deployed in his defense, according to the New York Post news 
 teen dashakon tak iraq par shashan karne vaale saddaam ko 69 varsh kii aayu main faansee par chadha diya gaya tha
 When Saddam was in Baghdad before the trial began, a group of US soldiers from the 551st Military Police Company were stationed under his supervision

 The comments report main bataaya gaya ki saddaam kii nijee suraksha main tainaat in 12 america sainikon ke bich pehle chah maheene ek judaav sa ho gaya tha
 He also got involved with Saddam which remained till his last time
 kitaab kaa lekhak inhen surakshakarmiyon main se ek he
 In the book, Bardenverper wrote that Saddam preferred to water the grass that grew on a small pile of dust in one corner
 ve uski dekhbhaal aise karte the jaise ki ve 'khubasurat phool hon
 'they were very sensitive about their food, taking breakfast in many parts
 pehle omelet khate the, phir maffin or uske baad taaje fal
 If the omelette was chopped, they would refuse to eat
 unhen mithaiyaan bahut pasand thi
 Saddam had a keen interest in the lives of security personnel
 kai surakshakarmiyon ke bachche bhi the or saddaam pita ke taur par apane anubhavon kii kahaniyaan unhen sunaaya karte the
 His one story of discipline in children is worth remembering
 saddaam ne bataaya ki unke bete udai ne ek badi gambhir galati kar di thi jisase saddaam ko behad gussa aayaa tha
 Uday had opened fire on a team which killed many and injured many
 kitaab ke mutabik saddaam ne bataaya, 'mujhe bahut gussa aayaa or maine uski sabhi kaaren jala di
 'those cars also had expensive cars like Rolls Royce, Ferrari and Porsche
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The report stated that the first six months of engagement between these 12 US soldiers deployed under Saddam's personal security had become a bit of an affair
 inkaa saddaam se bhi judaav ho gaya jo unke antim samay tak bana rahaa
 The author of the book is one of these security personnel
 kitaab main bardenverper ne likhaa he ki saddaam ek kone main dhul ke chote se dher par ug ai ghaas ko pani dena pasand karte the
 They looked after him as if they were 'beautiful flowers'
 ' apane bhojan ko lekar ve kaaphi samvedansheel the, naashtaa kai hisson main lete the
 Eat omelets first, then muffins and then fresh fruits
 omelet katafata ho to ve khaane se manaa kar dete the
 He loved sweets

 Many security personnel also had children and Saddam used to tell them stories of his experiences as a father

 Saddam reported that his son Uday had made a serious mistake which angered Saddam
 udai ne ek dal par golibari kar di thi jisamen kai log maare gaye the or kai ghayal ho gaye the
 According to the book, Saddam told, 'I got very angry and i burned all his cars

 idhar kuch dinon main rail mantri or railway board ke chayaraman ke let se chalane ko lekar kai bayaan aae hai
 We will review through those statements what is the reason, what is the question and what are the answers
 kya sabhi ek baat kar rahe hai yaa jo kah rahe hai wo sahi baat kar rahe hai
 On May 30, Railway Board Chairman Ashwani Lohani made a comment on his Facebook
 shaayad let chal rahi gadiyon ko lekar uth rahe sawaalon ke sandarbh main yah unka jawaab hoga
 He writes that 'the media often raises the issue of late trains running in the north to east sector
 hamaara dhyaan suraksha kaaryon or buniyadi dhaachon par he jaise dedicated fret coridor karporation or level crossing samaapt karne par he
 In recent times, there has also been a veracity in the reporting of trains, due to which the time figure of trains has started to look very poor
 samay kii sahi reportinc ke kaaran 12 se 15 pratishat adhik dikhne laga he
 Whereas the fact is that new trains have been run randomly without expanding the infrastructure
 hamen dashakon kii andekhi ke kaaran paidaa hui samasya ko bhi samajhnaa hoga jise itani aasaani se nahin dur kiya ja saktaa he
 Both sides will have to pay the price
 ' Now his statement has two parts
 ek buniyadi dhaanche kii andekhi or bina soche samajhe nai trainon ko laanch karnaa or doosraa hissaa he ki trainon ke let chalane kii reporting ab sahi ho rahi he isliye data main 12 se 15 pratishat adhik dikhne laga he
 Even if not visible in the data, the trains were late and still running
 ham duusare hisse kii baat karte hai
 Is truthfull reporting really happening? ham sidhe chalange nahin kar sakate magar hamaare paas ek cese study he
 We want Ashwani Lohani to check her record book properly
 31 may ko bihar ke saharsa railway stesan se ek yatri kaa phone aata he ki neshnal train ankavyari system (NETS) main dikhaa rahaa he ki 13026 janhit express saharsa pahunch gai he lekin main stesan par hum or train platform par nahin ai he
 It is showing on the website that the train has reached Saharsa station at 3
15 am
 25 minute kii deree se
 While talking to that passenger it was a quarter past four but the train did not come
 hamaare sahyogi kanhaiya bhaag kar stesan gaye or stesan ke register main darj train ke pahunchane ke samay kaa screen shot lekar hamen bhej dete hai
 Janhit Express goes from Danapur to Saharsa
 aap saaf-saaf dekh sakate hai ki isamen likhaa he ki train gantavy par pahunch gai he
 It is written in English that reached destination, time is given by a quarter to three
 25 minute kii deree se
 The correct time to reach it is 2:50 AM
 screen shot main dikhataa he ki register main haath se darj kiya gaya he
 You are seeing number 13206 of Janhit Express at number three
 isamen saaf likhaa he ki train 4 bajkar 35 minute par pahunchi he
 You have just seen that on the website the train has reached one hour late whereas in reality the train reaches after one hour
 ashvini lohani chairman railway board 1 june ko gorkhupar mandal ke daure par the jahaan hamaare sahyogi saleem ke ek general sawaal ke jawaab main kehete hai ki train jis samay pahunchati he ham vahi darj karte hai website main
 We will not challenge Chairman Lohani's statement as an example because it is childish but would like to tell him who was filling the data of the public interest express reaching Saharsa in a fake way
 kaise mumkin hua ki website main train dopaher sava teen baje pahunchati dikhti he or stesan ke register main sava chaar baje pahunchnaa darj he
 Now it comes to the first part of his Facebook post that the infrastructure was not expanded, meaning lines were not laid, they were not renewed and the railroad was not doubled
 pichhali sarkaron kii yah viraasat he
 If all this does not happen, then why does the Railway Minister write on Kaura, a social media site on May 29, that 407 trains were run during the four years of the Modi government to facilitate the passengers and improve the punchuatlity
 jab trek kii kshamta kaa adhiktam istamaal ho chukaa he to modi sarkaar ke daur main har saal 100 se adhik trainen kyon launch kii gayi
 You must have noticed that the Railway Minister is saying that 407 trains were launched so that puchuality is improved
 phir mantri ji ye bhi bataa den ki chaar saal main 400 train raajnneetik kaarnon se launch hui hai yaa vyaavhaarik kaarnon se
 Whereas in many places, the Railway Minister and the Chairman of the Railway Board say that the previous governments have launched trains irrespective of the track capacity, which is causing the delay
 kya aapako ajeeb nahin lagata he
 '65 is a single track between Mumbai and Chennai
 uttar purv gadiyon par 180 pratishat zyada he lod
 We are doing fine ' rail mantri ne apana yah bayaan khud hi twit kiya he
 The reason here is clear that the renewal, doubling and gauge conversion of the track is a big reason
 hoga bhi
 But we could not find anywhere in such statements that work is going on so many km in this route, it has been running for so many days and its current status is this
 ab do khabaron kii baat karte hai
 PTI reported on 30 May 2018 that the Railway Ministry has organized a two-day workshop in which all the top officials have attended
 is news main mishan raftaar kaa zikr he
 It was found out that the mission has been going on for three years, then why its result is bad towards North India
 pitiai kii khabar main he ki mishan raftaar ke tahat agle paanch saal main yatri gaadi or maal gaadi kii ausat raftaar main 25 kimi prati ghante kaa izaafaa kiya jayega
 The average speed of a passenger train is 44 km per hour and the average speed of a goods train is 25 km per hour
 internet par mili ek puraani khabar ke anusaar 2010 main rail mantri ke taur par mamata banerjee ne vijan 2020 launch kiya tha
 There was talk of running four bullet trains and the target was to increase the average speed of the remaining trains to 160-200 kmph
 magar piyush goyal to paanch saal main ausat raftaar 69 kimi prati ghante karnaa chaahate hai
 If there is no mistake in my understanding, then where did the vision 2020 that a railway minister had prepared by putting public money and what is his status
 ravivaar or somvaar ko aapane kai samachar patron or channelon par dekha hoga ki rail mantri ne railway ke sabhi 16 zone ke adhikariyon kii javabdehi tay kii he
 Many people started congratulating me that the rail series is taking effect
 jabaki isi tarah kii khabar lohani sahab ke naam se chap chuki he ki unhone zonal adhikariyon se kaha he ki samay main sudhaar karen
 What was the result of that order, they should have told
 tabhi rail mantri kii baat sunakar laga ki kahin pehle to nahin suna he
 The PTI was quoted as saying that the Railway Minister has warned all zone heads that if trains have not improved in a month, the evaluation will be affected during their promotion
 jabaki aapane rail mantri or chairman railway board ko kai baar kehete suna ki 65 saal se trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin hua isliye trainen let chal rahi hai to kya 65 saal kii samasya ye zonal adhikari ek maheene main thik kar denge
 The railway minister should clearly state where the problems lie
 trek kii kshamta main he yaa adhikariyon kii kaarykushalta main he
 Or the problem lies in their various statements and decisions
 agar letlatifi main adhikari pramotion rukne ke dar se ek maheene main sudhaar laa sakate hai to vaaki ye kaam pehle kiya janaa chahie tha taaki kai logon ko nuksaan nahin hota
 Is the Railway Minister awake for the first time, giving instructions to officers for the first time, is not so at all
 unhen thik se pataa he ki unke twitor handle par rose badi sankhya main yatri let hone kii shikaayat karte hai
 6 November 2017 He writes in response to Apoorva Kumar that 'thank you
 trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne bahut saare prayaas kiye hai
 Including revision of capacity expansion project and time table
 ' 7 march 2018 ko twit karte hai ki 'pehle railway kii maansikta thi ki hamaare paas fund kii kami he to sab kuch deree kar do
 Now the mindset is to pursue everything and do it fast because we have enough funds
 ' 7 march ko twit karte hai ki 'bhartiya rail main haath se samaybaddhata ko ricard karne kaa abhyaas sabhi zonon ke 41 bade steshnon se hataa diya gaya taaki trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaai ja sake or sawari ko sahi samay main train kii sthiti kii jaankaree di ja sake
 On March 10, the Railway Minister tweets the story of Financial Express that Goodbye to Late trains means that trains are late and now say Goodbye
 bhartiya railway ne samaybaddhata ko sunishchit karne ke liye ye das tareeke apanaae hai
 ' financial express kii jis story ko mantri ne twit kiya tha ki wo yah thi ki rail mantri chaahate hai ki bhartiya rail sweetsraland ke rail kii tarah honi chahie jahaan ghadiyaan train ke pahunchane ke time se milaai jaati hai
 Now let me tell you a fact here, the Railway Minister would know
 isi 14 march ko sansad main rail mantralay ne jawaab diya he ki rail kii niti he ki 15 minute kii deree tak pahunchane vaali gaadi ko samay par mana jaataa he
 That is, the Ministry of Railways officially considers 15 minutes late as Right Time
 nanvabar se march ke twit or unke bhaashan bataate hai ki let chalane kii baat unke dimag main he magar vahi bataa sakate hai ki is dauraan kya sudhaar hua
 What was the result of his earlier instructions
 14 march ko rail rajya mantri kaa hi jawaab he loksabhaa main ki maujuuda vitt varsh main har din 451 gaadiyaan deree se pahunchati hai
 Then what action did the minister take during that time, will stop the promotion like what was the result of his statements before the headline statement
 hamane rail series main dikhaaya tha ki patna-kota kabhi 20-25 ghate se kam let nahin chalati he
 Now it has improved
 lekin isi uttar railway main 10 april 2017 se 10 march 2018 ke bich 1341 rajdhani express, 632 duranton, 1425 shatabdi let se pahunchi
 Meaning VIP trains are also running late and do not ask the condition of Bhagalpur Garib Rath
 chakra aa jayega
 PTI has reported in the promotion news that the maximum number of trains are running in North India
 is saal let hone kii dar 49
 59 per cent means 50 per cent trains are late while 31 last year
 74 pratishat trainen let chali thim
 How has there been so much growth in a year, only the Railway Minister can tell, whether a new project has been launched, where has that project been launched
 agar trek kaaran he to kya uttar railway ke general manager ek maheene ke andar vaaki gadiyon ke samay se chalane main sudhaar kar sakate hai
 His BP must be getting high, we understand
 20 april 2018 ko prabhaat khabar kii ek report he
 The 42 km line between Raxaul to Narkatiaganj is still incomplete with plans to upgrade, doubling and gauge conversion from meter gauge to broad gauge, when it was launched on 1 April 2014
 paanch saal main 42 kimi line nahin ban pai he
 The train is the only option for people on this route for long distances
 rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaura par likhaa he ki 'modi sarkaar ke daur main har din 6
 Projects of renovation, doubling and conversion of 5 km lines are launched
 ' is hisaab se is saal 1 janvari se 31 may ke bich 981
 Projects to improve the capacity of the 5 km lines would have been launched
 is hisaab se puure saal main 2372
 Projects to improve capacity of 5 km lines will be launched
 kya aapako pataa he ki 2018-19 ke bajet main lakshya 18,000 kimi line ke dabl karne kaa he
 Accordingly, there is nothing to improve the capacity of 2375 km lines in front of 18000 km
 bayaan to khub milte hai magar pramaan nahin milte hai
 If you hear that at the time of UPA 4
 5 kimi prati din rail line kaa project launch hota tha or ab 6
 Launching 5 km per day will affect you soon but it is far less than the rail's own goal
 is tarah se agar ham rail mantri ke bayanon kii samiksha karen to chintajanak sthiti nazar aati he
 The Sam Pitroda Committee suggested in 2012 that the 18,000 km railway line be modernized between 2012-17
 us report or lakshya kaa kya hua ham nahin jaanate jabaki use banane main janata kaa hi paisa or samay laga hoga
 Can 18000 km of track be doubled, refurbished and changed in 2018-19? lakshya bada ho thik he magar sahi to ho
 Between 2014 and 2018, the railways could not improve the total capacity of the 18000 km track, so how will it do in a year
 in aankadon ko dekh kar yahi lagata he ki bayaan hi pramaan he
 The evidence is poor
 bajet main kuch he, standing cameti main kuch or he
 Even if someone studies, our people are studying here, especially Shivank only keeps reading, with whose help i have reached these documents
 2016-17 main 2828 kimi puraani linon ke navinikaran kaa lakshya tha
 We had the same goal for 2017-18, we do not know what the status of both are
 tippaniyan Is this all happening for Achieve a Headline
 agar piyush goyal ko bura na lage ki ashvini lohani ke ek bayaan kaa zikr karnaa chahta hum jo unhone doordarshan ko die intervyuu main kaha he
 They say that attention is being paid to maintenance, which was not being given full attention till last year
 jab durghatnaayen huin tab ye nirnay liya gaya
 Doing now
 lohani ji ne yah bhi kaha ki lakhanu or mughalsarai line par mentanence hona tha magar uskaa kaam nahin hua
 Whose or whose responsibility was it? koi batayega ki trek kaa mentanence kyon nahin ho rahaa tha
 Why was it ignored? Were vehicles not running late last year? We had told in the rail series that many trains were running late for 30 hours every year
 rajdhani, duranton shatabdi bhi deree se chal rahi thim
 The Railway Minister considers the introduction of 407 vehicles as an achievement, the Chairman of the Railway Board considers the problem or challenge
 behatar he donon aapas main baat kar len
 Rail Budget, Standing Committee, Board Chairman and Railway Minister will be fine if we talk one thing
 kam se kam rail mantri or railway board ke chairman ko aapas main baat kar lenaa chahie
 If the Ministry of Railways reveals some shortcomings in the combination of our facts, we will definitely include it after returning from leave
 2 june ke new indian express main report chhapi he ki pichley do saal main railway ko tikat cancellesan ne 2,760 karod rupee mili hai
 This figure is surprising
 hawaii yatri ko tikat cancil karne se koi shulk nahin lagegaa, aisa prastaav jayant sinha dete hai magar rail mantri piyush goyal ke mantralay main tikat cancel karne ke itane kade niyam hai ki aam yatri lut rahaa he
 When there is a burden on the track, then why are the railway ministers launching trains
 jis samay ve nai trainon ke launch ko samasya bataa rahe hai usee samay yani 2 june ko jodhpur se banda ke liye humsafar ko launch kyon kar rahe hai jabaki ek bayaan main ve kah chuke hai ki bombai chenna maarg 65 saal se single padaa he
 But the train is not lying on that route
 lohani ji ne doordarshan se kaha he ki train zyaadaatar uttar main let chal rahi hai
 This is the second new train from Jodhpur in a month
 us maukey par mantri ji ke bhaashan main aap sun sakate hai ki ve samay ko lekar kitna pareshaan hai
 It seems that the dynamic minister has started watching prime time
 baat kaarnon kii nahin he, baat he focus kii
 If this series creates focus then it is fine
 ab inke bayaan ke do hisse hai
 One is to ignore the infrastructure and launch new trains randomly and the other part is that the reporting of late running of trains is now correcting, so 12 to 15 percent more is visible in the data
 data main nahin bhi dikhataa to bhi trainen let to chali hi rahi thim or chal hi rahi hai
 We talk about the second part
 kya vaaki truthfull reporting ho rahi he
 We cannot challenge directly but we have a case study
 ham chaahate hai ki ashvini lohani apana record book thik se check karen
 On May 31, a passenger from Bihar's Saharsa railway station receives a call that the National Train Encouragement System (NETS) is showing that 13026 Janhit Express has reached Saharsa but i am at the station and the train has not come on the platform
 website par dikhaa rahaa he ki train 3 baj kar 15 minute par saharsa stesan pahunch chuki he
 With a delay of 25 minutes
 us yatri se baat karte karte sava chaar ho gaye the magar train nahin ai thi
 Our colleague Kanhaiya ran to the station and sends us a screen shot of the arrival time of the train registered in the station register
 janhit express danapur se saharsa jaati he
 You can clearly see that it is written that the train has reached the destination
 angrezi main likhaa he ki reached destination, samay diya he sava teen kaa
 With a delay of 25 minutes
 iske pahunchane kaa sahi samay he 2 bajkar 50 minute
 The screen shot shows that the register has been recorded by hand
 tisare number par aap dekh rahe hai janhit express kaa number 13206
 It clearly states that the train has arrived at 4
35 am
 aapane abhi-abhi dekha ki website par train ek ghanta let pahunchi he jabaki hakeekat main train ek ghanta baad pahunchati he
 Ashwani Lohani Chairman Railway Board was visiting Gorakhupar Mandal on 1 June where our colleague says in response to a general question of Salim that we enter the same time when the train reaches the website
 ham ek udhaaharan ke dam par chairman lohani ke is bayaan ko chunauti to nahin denge kyonki wo bachakaana ho jaataa he magar unhen zarur bataanaa chahenge ki saharsa pahunchane vaali janhit express kaa data koun farji tareeke se bhar rahaa tha ye wo pataa karen
 How is it possible that the train appears in the website at three and a quarter to three o'clock and the station register is recorded at four and a quarter
 ab aate hai unke fasebuk post ke pehle hisse par ki buniyadi dhaanche kaa vistaar nahin hua, matlab line nahin bichhin, unka navinikaran nahin hua or rail maarg kaa doharikaran nahin hua
 This is the legacy of previous governments
 agar ye sab nahin hua to phir rail mantri 29 may ko soshal media kii ek site kwora par kyon likhte hai ki modi sarkaar ke chaar saal ke dauraan 407 railgadiyaan chalaai gayi taaki yatriyon ko suvidha ho or punchuatlity yani samay main sudhaar ho
 When the capacity of the track has been utilized to the maximum, why more than 100 trains were launched every year during the Modi government
 aapane gaur kiya hoga ki rail mantri kah rahe hai ki 407 trainen isliye launch kii gayi taaki puchuality main sudhaar ho
 Then the Minister should also tell that in four years 400 trains have been launched for political reasons or for practical reasons
 jabaki kai jagahon par rail mantri or rail board ke chayaraman kehete hai ki trek kshamta kii parvaah kiye bagair pichhali sarkaron ne gaadiyaan launch kar deen jiske kaaran let ho rahi hai
 Don't you feel weird '65 saal se mumbai-chennai ke bich single trek he
 Load is 180 percent more on North East trains
 ham thik kar rahe hai
 The Railway Minister has tweeted this statement himself

 On May 31, a passenger from Bihar's Saharsa railway station receives a call that the National Train Encouragement System (NETS) is showing that 13026 Janhit Express has reached Saharsa but i am at the station and the train has not come on the platform
 website par dikhaa rahaa he ki train 3 baj kar 15 minute par saharsa stesan pahunch chuki he
 With a delay of 25 minutes
 us yatri se baat karte karte sava chaar ho gaye the magar train nahin ai thi
 Our colleague Kanhaiya ran to the station and sends us a screen shot of the arrival time of the train registered in the station register
 janhit express danapur se saharsa jaati he
 You can clearly see that it is written that the train has reached the destination
 angrezi main likhaa he ki reached destination, samay diya he sava teen kaa
 With a delay of 25 minutes
 iske pahunchane kaa sahi samay he 2 bajkar 50 minute
 The screen shot shows that the register has been recorded by hand
 tisare number par aap dekh rahe hai janhit express kaa number 13206
 It clearly states that the train has arrived at 4
35 am
 aapane abhi-abhi dekha ki website par train ek ghanta let pahunchi he jabaki hakeekat main train ek ghanta baad pahunchati he
 Ashwani Lohani Chairman Railway Board was visiting Gorakhupar Mandal on 1 June where our colleague says in response to a general question of Salim that we enter the same time when the train reaches the website

 How is it possible that the train appears in the website at three and a quarter to three o'clock and the station register is recorded at four and a quarter
 ab aate hai unke fasebuk post ke pehle hisse par ki buniyadi dhaanche kaa vistaar nahin hua, matlab line nahin bichhin, unka navinikaran nahin hua or rail maarg kaa doharikaran nahin hua

 When the capacity of the track has been utilized to the maximum, why more than 100 trains were launched every year during the Modi government
 aapane gaur kiya hoga ki rail mantri kah rahe hai ki 407 trainen isliye launch kii gayi taaki puchuality main sudhaar ho
 Then the Minister should also tell that in four years 400 trains have been launched for political reasons or for practical reasons
 jabaki kai jagahon par rail mantri or rail board ke chayaraman kehete hai ki trek kshamta kii parvaah kiye bagair pichhali sarkaron ne gaadiyaan launch kar deen jiske kaaran let ho rahi hai
 Don't you feel weird '65 saal se mumbai-chennai ke bich single trek he

 pitiai ke hawaale se khabar ai he ki rail mantri ne sabhi zone pramukhon ko chetavanee di he ki agar ek maheene main trainon ke let chalane main sudhaar nahin hua he to unke pramotion ke dauraan moolyankan par asar padegaa
 While you heard the Railway Minister and Chairman Railway Board many times that the track capacity has not improved since 65 years, so trains are running late, will these zonal officers fix the problem of 65 years in a month
 rail mantri ko saaf kahana chahie ki samasya kahaan hai
 Is in track capacity or in the efficiency of the officers
 yaa samasya unke tarah tarah ke bayanon or faislon main he
 If the officials in Lethalifi can improve in a month for fear of stopping the promotion, then this work should have been done earlier so that many people are not harmed
 kya railmantri pehali baar jaage hai, pehali baar adhikariyon ko nirdesh de rahe hai, aisa bilkul nahin he
 He is well aware that on his Twitter handle, a large number of passengers complain of being late
 6 november 2017 ve apurva kumaar ke jawaab main likhte hai ki 'shukriya
 The government has made a lot of efforts to increase the timeliness of trains
 jinamein kshamta vistaar project or samay sarini kaa revizan bhi he
 'on 7 March 2018, tweet that' earlier there was a railway mentality that we are short of funds, then delay everything
 ab maansikta he ki har chiz ko aage badhaao or tezi se karo kyonki hamaare paas paryaapt fund he
 'on 7 March, tweeting that' the practice of recording manual punctuality in the Indian Railways was dropped from 41 major stations of all zones to increase the timeliness of trains and to inform the train status of the train at the right time
 Could
 ' 10 march ko rail mantri financial express kii story ko twit karte hai ki gudbai tu let trains yani trainon kaa let hone ko ab gudbai kah dijie
 Indian Railways has adopted these ten methods to ensure timeliness
 ' The story of the Financial Express that the Minister tweeted was that the Railway Minister wants the Indian Railways to be like the railroad of Switzerland where the watches are mixed from the time the train arrives
 ab main aapako yahaan ek tathy bataata hum, rail mantri ko to pataa hi hoga
 On 14 March, in the Parliament, the Ministry of Railways has responded that it is the policy of the railways that a vehicle reaching 15 minutes late is considered on time
 matlab 15 minute let ko aadhikarik rup se rhite time maanata he rail mantralay
 March tweets and his speeches from November show that it is in his mind to keep going late, but only he can tell what improved during this time
 unke pehle ke nirdeshon kaa kya nateeja niklaa
 On 14 March, the Minister of State for Railways has the answer in the Lok Sabha that 451 trains arrive late in the current financial year
 to phir us dauraan mantri ji ne kya ection liya, pramotion roak denge jaise hedline vaale bayaan se pehle ke unke bayanon kaa kya riselt niklaa
 We had shown in the rail series that patna-kota never lasts less than 20-25 hours
 ab usamen sudhaar aa gaya he
 But in the same Northern Railway between 10 April 2017 to 10 March 2018, 1341 Rajdhani Express arrived, 632 Duronto, 1425 Shatabdi late
 matlab viipi train bhi let se chal rahi hai or bhagalpur garib rath kaa haal to puuchhie hi mat
 The cycle will come
 pitiai ne pramotion vaali khabar main bataaya he ki sabase adhik train uttar bharat main chal rahi he
 The latency rate this year is 49
 59 pratishat he yani 50 pratishat trainen let chalati hai jabaki pichley saal 31
 74 percent trains were late
 ek saal main itani vruddhi kaise ho gai, rail mantri hi bataa sakate hai, kya koi nayaa project launch ho gaya, wo project kahaan launch hua he
 If the track is the reason, can the general manager of Northern Railway really improve the running time of the vehicles within a month
 unka beepi hai ho rahaa hoga, ham samajhate hai
 There is a report of Prabhat Khabar on 20 April 2018
 raksol se narkatiyaganj ke bich 42 kimi line par navinikaran, doharikaran or amman parivartan yani meter gej se broad gej karne kii yojana abhi tak adhuri he jabaki yah 1 april 2014 ko launch hui thi
 The 42 km line has not been built in five years
 lambii duuri ke liye is root ke logon ke liye train hi ekmaatr vikalp he
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has written on Kaura that '6 every day during the Modi government
 5 kimi ke hisaab linon ke navinikaran, doharikaran or parivartan ke project launch hote hai
 'accordingly, 981 between 1 January and 31 May this year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch hue honge
 Accordingly, 2372 in the whole year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch honge
 Do you know that in the 2018-19 budget, the target is to double the 18,000 km line
 is hisaab se 18000 kimi ke saamne 2375 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar kaa project kuch bhi nahin he
 There are plenty of statements but no evidence is found
 agar aap sunen ki upie ke samay 4
 5 km per day rail line project was launched and now 6
 5 kimi prati din launch ho rahaa he to jaldi prabhavit ho jaaenge magar yah to rail ke apane hi lakshya se bahut kam he
 In this way, if we review the statements of the Railway Minister, then the situation seems alarming
 sam pitroda cameti ne 2012 main suzav diya tha ki 2012-17 ke bich 18,000 kimi rail line ko aadhunik banaaya jaae
 We do not know what happened to that report and the target, whereas it would have cost the public money and time to make it
 kya 2018-19 main 18000 kimi trek kaa doharikaran, navinikaran or parivartan ho saktaa he? It is okay to have a big goal, but it should be true
 2014 se 2018 ke bich railway kul milakar 18000 kimi trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin kar pai to ek saal main kaise kar legi
 Looking at these figures, it seems that the statement is the proof
 pramaan benishaan hai
 There is something in the budget, there is something else in the Standing Committee
 koi padhata bhi he to yahaan hami log pard rahe hai khaskar shivank hi padhate rahete hai jinaki madad se in dastavezon tak pahunchaa hum
 There was a target of renovation of 2828 km old lines in 2016-17
 2017-18 ke liye bhi itnaa hi lakshya tha, donon kaa kya states he ham nahin jaanate
 The comments kya yah sab kuch hasil e hedline ke liye ho rahaa he
 If Piyush Goyal does not mind that i want to mention a statement of Ashwani Lohani which he has said in an interview to Doordarshan
 ve kehete hai ki mentanence par dhyaan diya ja rahaa he jo pichley saal tak puure tareeke se dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 This decision was taken when accidents occurred
 ab kar rahe hai
 Lohani also said that there was to be maintenance on the Lucknow and Mughalsarai lines, but it did not work
 isaki javabdehi kiski thi yaa kiski he
 Someone will explain why the track was not being maintained
 kyon isaki upeksha kii gai? kya pichley saal gaadiyaan let nahin chal rahi thim? hamane rail series main bataaya tha ki kai gaadiyaan ek-ek saal se 30-30 ghante let chal rahi thim
 The capital, Duranto Shatabdi, was also running late
 rail mantri ji 407 gaadiyaan shuru karne ko uplabdhi maanate hai, railway board ke chairman samasya yaa chunauti maanate hai
 It is better to talk to each other
 rail bajet, standing cameti, board chairman or rail mantri ek baat karen to thik rahegaa
 At least the Railway Minister and the Chairman of the Railway Board should talk among themselves
 agar rail mantralay hamaare tathyon ke sangyojan main kuch kamiyaan ujagar karata he to use chuttee se lautne ke baad zarur shaamil karuunga
 The report appeared in the New Indian Express on June 2 that the ticket cancellation has received Rs 2,760 crore from the Railways in the last two years
 yah aankada hairaan karne vaala he
 There is no charge for cancellation of tickets for air passenger, Jayant Sinha gives such a proposal, but Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has such strict rules of cancellation of tickets in the ministry that the common passenger is being looted
 jab trek par boj he to phir railmantri trainon ko launch kyon kar rahe hai
 At the same time, when they are calling the launch of new trains a problem, that is why on June 2, they are launching a Humsafar from Jodhpur to Banda, in a statement, they have said that the Bombay Chenna route has been single for 65 years
 magar us maarg par to train let nahin he
 Lohani has told Doordarshan that trains are mostly running late in the north
 ek maheene main jodhpur se yah duusari nai train chali he
 On that occasion you can hear in the speech of the minister how much he is worried about the time
 lagata he dinemic mantri ji prime time dekhne lage hai
 It is not about reasons, it is about focus
 agar is series se focus banataa he to phir thik he
 We will not challenge Chairman Lohani's statement as an example because it is childish but would like to tell him who was filling the data of the public interest express reaching Saharsa in a fake way
 kaise mumkin hua ki website main train dopaher sava teen baje pahunchati dikhti he or stesan ke register main sava chaar baje pahunchnaa darj he
 Now it comes to the first part of his Facebook post that the infrastructure was not expanded, meaning lines were not laid, they were not renewed and the railroad was not doubled
 pichhali sarkaron kii yah viraasat he
 If all this does not happen, then why does the Railway Minister write on Kaura, a social media site on May 29, that 407 trains were run during the four years of the Modi government to facilitate the passengers and improve the punchuatlity
 jab trek kii kshamta kaa adhiktam istamaal ho chukaa he to modi sarkaar ke daur main har saal 100 se adhik trainen kyon launch kii gayi
 You must have noticed that the Railway Minister is saying that 407 trains were launched so that puchuality is improved
 phir mantri ji ye bhi bataa den ki chaar saal main 400 train raajnneetik kaarnon se launch hui hai yaa vyaavhaarik kaarnon se
 Whereas in many places, the Railway Minister and the Chairman of the Railway Board say that the previous governments have launched trains irrespective of the track capacity, which is causing the delay
 kya aapako ajeeb nahin lagata he
 '65 is a single track between Mumbai and Chennai
 uttar purv gadiyon par 180 pratishat zyada he lod
 We are doing fine ' rail mantri ne apana yah bayaan khud hi twit kiya he
 The reason here is clear that the renewal, doubling and gauge conversion of the track is a big reason
 hoga bhi
 But we could not find anywhere in such statements that work is going on so many km in this route, it has been running for so many days and its current status is this
 ab do khabaron kii baat karte hai
 PTI reported on 30 May 2018 that the Railway Ministry has organized a two-day workshop in which all the top officials have attended
 is news main mishan raftaar kaa zikr he
 It was found out that the mission has been going on for three years, then why its result is bad towards North India
 pitiai kii khabar main he ki mishan raftaar ke tahat agle paanch saal main yatri gaadi or maal gaadi kii ausat raftaar main 25 kimi prati ghante kaa izaafaa kiya jayega
 The average speed of a passenger train is 44 km per hour and the average speed of a goods train is 25 km per hour
 internet par mili ek puraani khabar ke anusaar 2010 main rail mantri ke taur par mamata banerjee ne vijan 2020 launch kiya tha
 There was talk of running four bullet trains and the target was to increase the average speed of the remaining trains to 160-200 kmph
 magar piyush goyal to paanch saal main ausat raftaar 69 kimi prati ghante karnaa chaahate hai
 If there is no mistake in my understanding, then where did the vision 2020 that a railway minister had prepared by putting public money and what is his status
 ravivaar or somvaar ko aapane kai samachar patron or channelon par dekha hoga ki rail mantri ne railway ke sabhi 16 zone ke adhikariyon kii javabdehi tay kii he
 Many people started congratulating me that the rail series is taking effect
 jabaki isi tarah kii khabar lohani sahab ke naam se chap chuki he ki unhone zonal adhikariyon se kaha he ki samay main sudhaar karen
 What was the result of that order, they should have told
 tabhi rail mantri kii baat sunakar laga ki kahin pehle to nahin suna he
 The PTI was quoted as saying that the Railway Minister has warned all zone heads that if trains have not improved in a month, the evaluation will be affected during their promotion
 jabaki aapane rail mantri or chairman railway board ko kai baar kehete suna ki 65 saal se trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin hua isliye trainen let chal rahi hai to kya 65 saal kii samasya ye zonal adhikari ek maheene main thik kar denge
 The railway minister should clearly state where the problems lie
 trek kii kshamta main he yaa adhikariyon kii kaarykushalta main he
 Or the problem lies in their various statements and decisions
 agar letlatifi main adhikari pramotion rukne ke dar se ek maheene main sudhaar laa sakate hai to vaaki ye kaam pehle kiya janaa chahie tha taaki kai logon ko nuksaan nahin hota
 Is the Railway Minister awake for the first time, giving instructions to officers for the first time, is not so at all
 unhen thik se pataa he ki unke twitor handle par rose badi sankhya main yatri let hone kii shikaayat karte hai
 6 November 2017 He writes in response to Apoorva Kumar that 'thank you
 trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne bahut saare prayaas kiye hai
 Including revision of capacity expansion project and time table
 ' 7 march 2018 ko twit karte hai ki 'pehle railway kii maansikta thi ki hamaare paas fund kii kami he to sab kuch deree kar do
 Now the mindset is to pursue everything and do it fast because we have enough funds
 ' 7 march ko twit karte hai ki 'bhartiya rail main haath se samaybaddhata ko ricard karne kaa abhyaas sabhi zonon ke 41 bade steshnon se hataa diya gaya taaki trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaai ja sake or sawari ko sahi samay main train kii sthiti kii jaankaree di ja sake
 On March 10, the Railway Minister tweets the story of Financial Express that Goodbye to Late trains means that trains are late and now say Goodbye
 bhartiya railway ne samaybaddhata ko sunishchit karne ke liye ye das tareeke apanaae hai
 ' financial express kii jis story ko mantri ne twit kiya tha ki wo yah thi ki rail mantri chaahate hai ki bhartiya rail sweetsraland ke rail kii tarah honi chahie jahaan ghadiyaan train ke pahunchane ke time se milaai jaati hai
 Now let me tell you a fact here, the Railway Minister would know
 isi 14 march ko sansad main rail mantralay ne jawaab diya he ki rail kii niti he ki 15 minute kii deree tak pahunchane vaali gaadi ko samay par mana jaataa he
 That is, the Ministry of Railways officially considers 15 minutes late as Right Time
 nanvabar se march ke twit or unke bhaashan bataate hai ki let chalane kii baat unke dimag main he magar vahi bataa sakate hai ki is dauraan kya sudhaar hua
 What was the result of his earlier instructions
 14 march ko rail rajya mantri kaa hi jawaab he loksabhaa main ki maujuuda vitt varsh main har din 451 gaadiyaan deree se pahunchati hai
 Then what action did the minister take during that time, will stop the promotion like what was the result of his statements before the headline statement
 hamane rail series main dikhaaya tha ki patna-kota kabhi 20-25 ghate se kam let nahin chalati he
 Now it has improved
 lekin isi uttar railway main 10 april 2017 se 10 march 2018 ke bich 1341 rajdhani express, 632 duranton, 1425 shatabdi let se pahunchi
 Meaning VIP trains are also running late and do not ask the condition of Bhagalpur Garib Rath
 chakra aa jayega
 PTI has reported in the promotion news that the maximum number of trains are running in North India
 is saal let hone kii dar 49
 59 per cent means 50 per cent trains are late while 31 last year
 74 pratishat trainen let chali thim
 How has there been so much growth in a year, only the Railway Minister can tell, whether a new project has been launched, where has that project been launched
 agar trek kaaran he to kya uttar railway ke general manager ek maheene ke andar vaaki gadiyon ke samay se chalane main sudhaar kar sakate hai
 His BP must be getting high, we understand
 20 april 2018 ko prabhaat khabar kii ek report he
 The 42 km line between Raxaul to Narkatiaganj is still incomplete with plans to upgrade, doubling and gauge conversion from meter gauge to broad gauge, when it was launched on 1 April 2014
 paanch saal main 42 kimi line nahin ban pai he
 The train is the only option for people on this route for long distances
 rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaura par likhaa he ki 'modi sarkaar ke daur main har din 6
 Projects of renovation, doubling and conversion of 5 km lines are launched
 ' is hisaab se is saal 1 janvari se 31 may ke bich 981
 Projects to improve the capacity of the 5 km lines would have been launched
 is hisaab se puure saal main 2372
 Projects to improve capacity of 5 km lines will be launched
 kya aapako pataa he ki 2018-19 ke bajet main lakshya 18,000 kimi line ke dabl karne kaa he
 Accordingly, there is nothing to improve the capacity of 2375 km lines in front of 18000 km
 bayaan to khub milte hai magar pramaan nahin milte hai
 If you hear that at the time of UPA 4
 5 kimi prati din rail line kaa project launch hota tha or ab 6
 Launching 5 km per day will affect you soon but it is far less than the rail's own goal
 is tarah se agar ham rail mantri ke bayanon kii samiksha karen to chintajanak sthiti nazar aati he
 The Sam Pitroda Committee suggested in 2012 that the 18,000 km railway line be modernized between 2012-17
 us report or lakshya kaa kya hua ham nahin jaanate jabaki use banane main janata kaa hi paisa or samay laga hoga
 Can 18000 km of track be doubled, refurbished and changed in 2018-19? lakshya bada ho thik he magar sahi to ho
 Between 2014 and 2018, the railways could not improve the total capacity of the 18000 km track, so how will it do in a year
 in aankadon ko dekh kar yahi lagata he ki bayaan hi pramaan he
 The evidence is poor
 bajet main kuch he, standing cameti main kuch or he
 Even if someone studies, our people are studying here, especially Shivank only keeps reading, with whose help i have reached these documents
 2016-17 main 2828 kimi puraani linon ke navinikaran kaa lakshya tha
 We had the same goal for 2017-18, we do not know what the status of both are
 tippaniyan Is this all happening for Achieve a Headline
 agar piyush goyal ko bura na lage ki ashvini lohani ke ek bayaan kaa zikr karnaa chahta hum jo unhone doordarshan ko die intervyuu main kaha he
 They say that attention is being paid to maintenance, which was not being given full attention till last year
 jab durghatnaayen huin tab ye nirnay liya gaya
 Doing now
 lohani ji ne yah bhi kaha ki lakhanu or mughalsarai line par mentanence hona tha magar uskaa kaam nahin hua
 Whose or whose responsibility was it? koi batayega ki trek kaa mentanence kyon nahin ho rahaa tha
 Why was it ignored? Were vehicles not running late last year? We had told in the rail series that many trains were running late for 30 hours every year
 rajdhani, duranton shatabdi bhi deree se chal rahi thim
 The Railway Minister considers the introduction of 407 vehicles as an achievement, the Chairman of the Railway Board considers the problem or challenge
 behatar he donon aapas main baat kar len
 Rail Budget, Standing Committee, Board Chairman and Railway Minister will be fine if we talk one thing
 kam se kam rail mantri or railway board ke chairman ko aapas main baat kar lenaa chahie
 If the Ministry of Railways reveals some shortcomings in the combination of our facts, we will definitely include it after returning from leave
 2 june ke new indian express main report chhapi he ki pichley do saal main railway ko tikat cancellesan ne 2,760 karod rupee mili hai
 This figure is surprising
 hawaii yatri ko tikat cancil karne se koi shulk nahin lagegaa, aisa prastaav jayant sinha dete hai magar rail mantri piyush goyal ke mantralay main tikat cancel karne ke itane kade niyam hai ki aam yatri lut rahaa he
 When there is a burden on the track, then why are the railway ministers launching trains
 jis samay ve nai trainon ke launch ko samasya bataa rahe hai usee samay yani 2 june ko jodhpur se banda ke liye humsafar ko launch kyon kar rahe hai jabaki ek bayaan main ve kah chuke hai ki bombai chenna maarg 65 saal se single padaa he
 But the train is not lying on that route
 lohani ji ne doordarshan se kaha he ki train zyaadaatar uttar main let chal rahi hai
 This is the second new train from Jodhpur in a month
 us maukey par mantri ji ke bhaashan main aap sun sakate hai ki ve samay ko lekar kitna pareshaan hai
 It seems that the dynamic minister has started watching prime time
 baat kaarnon kii nahin he, baat he focus kii
 If this series creates focus then it is fine
 jab trek kii kshamta kaa adhiktam istamaal ho chukaa he to modi sarkaar ke daur main har saal 100 se adhik trainen kyon launch kii gayi
 You must have noticed that the Railway Minister is saying that 407 trains were launched so that puchuality is improved
 phir mantri ji ye bhi bataa den ki chaar saal main 400 train raajnneetik kaarnon se launch hui hai yaa vyaavhaarik kaarnon se

 5 kimi prati din rail line kaa project launch hota tha or ab 6
 Launching 5 km per day will affect you soon but it is far less than the rail's own goal
 is tarah se agar ham rail mantri ke bayanon kii samiksha karen to chintajanak sthiti nazar aati he
 The Sam Pitroda Committee suggested in 2012 that the 18,000 km railway line be modernized between 2012-17
 us report or lakshya kaa kya hua ham nahin jaanate jabaki use banane main janata kaa hi paisa or samay laga hoga
 Can 18000 km of track be doubled, refurbished and changed in 2018-19? lakshya bada ho thik he magar sahi to ho
 Between 2014 and 2018, the railways could not improve the total capacity of the 18000 km track, so how will it do in a year
 in aankadon ko dekh kar yahi lagata he ki bayaan hi pramaan he
 The evidence is poor
 bajet main kuch he, standing cameti main kuch or he
 Even if someone studies, our people are studying here, especially Shivank only keeps reading, with whose help i have reached these documents
 2016-17 main 2828 kimi puraani linon ke navinikaran kaa lakshya tha
 We had the same goal for 2017-18, we do not know what the status of both are
 tippaniyan Is this all happening for Achieve a Headline
 agar piyush goyal ko bura na lage ki ashvini lohani ke ek bayaan kaa zikr karnaa chahta hum jo unhone doordarshan ko die intervyuu main kaha he
 They say that attention is being paid to maintenance, which was not being given full attention till last year
 jab durghatnaayen huin tab ye nirnay liya gaya
 Doing now
 lohani ji ne yah bhi kaha ki lakhanu or mughalsarai line par mentanence hona tha magar uskaa kaam nahin hua
 Whose or whose responsibility was it? koi batayega ki trek kaa mentanence kyon nahin ho rahaa tha
 Why was it ignored? Were vehicles not running late last year? We had told in the rail series that many trains were running late for 30 hours every year
 rajdhani, duranton shatabdi bhi deree se chal rahi thim
 The Railway Minister considers the introduction of 407 vehicles as an achievement, the Chairman of the Railway Board considers the problem or challenge
 behatar he donon aapas main baat kar len
 Rail Budget, Standing Committee, Board Chairman and Railway Minister will be fine if we talk one thing
 kam se kam rail mantri or railway board ke chairman ko aapas main baat kar lenaa chahie
 If the Ministry of Railways reveals some shortcomings in the combination of our facts, we will definitely include it after returning from leave
 2 june ke new indian express main report chhapi he ki pichley do saal main railway ko tikat cancellesan ne 2,760 karod rupee mili hai
 This figure is surprising
 hawaii yatri ko tikat cancil karne se koi shulk nahin lagegaa, aisa prastaav jayant sinha dete hai magar rail mantri piyush goyal ke mantralay main tikat cancel karne ke itane kade niyam hai ki aam yatri lut rahaa he
 When there is a burden on the track, then why are the railway ministers launching trains
 jis samay ve nai trainon ke launch ko samasya bataa rahe hai usee samay yani 2 june ko jodhpur se banda ke liye humsafar ko launch kyon kar rahe hai jabaki ek bayaan main ve kah chuke hai ki bombai chenna maarg 65 saal se single padaa he
 But the train is not lying on that route
 lohani ji ne doordarshan se kaha he ki train zyaadaatar uttar main let chal rahi hai
 This is the second new train from Jodhpur in a month
 us maukey par mantri ji ke bhaashan main aap sun sakate hai ki ve samay ko lekar kitna pareshaan hai
 It seems that the dynamic minister has started watching prime time
 baat kaarnon kii nahin he, baat he focus kii
 If this series creates focus then it is fine
 '65 saal se mumbai-chennai ke bich single trek he
 Load is 180 percent more on North East trains
 ham thik kar rahe hai
 The Railway Minister has tweeted this statement himself
 yahaan kaaran saaf he ki trek kii navinikaran, doharikaran or amman parivartan bada kaaran he
 Will also
 lekin hamen itane bayanon main kahin nahin mila ki is root main itane kimi par kaam chal rahaa he, itane dinon se chal rahaa he or isaki tazaa sthiti ye he
 Now let's talk about the news
 30 may 2018 kii pitiai kii khabar he ki rail mantralay ne do dinon kii kaaryshaala yojit kii he jisamen sabhi bade adhikari shaamil hue hai
 Mission speed is mentioned in this news
 pataa chalaa ki teen saal se mishan raftaar chal rahaa he phir iskaa rigelt uttar bharat kii taraf kharaab kyon he
 PTI reports that under the mission speed, in the next five years, the average speed of passenger car and goods train will be increased to 25 km per hour
 is vakt yatri gaadi kii ausat raftaar 44 kimi prati ghanta he or maal gaadi kii ausat raftaar 25 kimi prati ghanta he
 According to an old news on internet, Mamata Banerjee launched Vision 2020 in 2010 as Railway Minister
 chaar bullate train chalaane kii baat thi usamen or baaki gadiyon kii ausat raftaar 160-200 kimi prati ghante kiye jane kaa lakshya tha
 But Piyush Goyal wants to reach an average speed of 69 kmph in five years
 agar mere samajhane main koi chook nahin hui he to wo vijan 2020 kahaan gaya jise ek railmantri ne janata ke paise lagaakar taiyaar kiya tha or uskaa states kya he
 On Sunday and Monday, you must have seen on many newspapers and channels that the Railway Minister has fixed the accountability of the officials of all the 16 zones of the railway
 kai log mujhe badhai dene lage ki rail siries kaa asar ho rahaa he
 While similar news has been published in the name of Lohani Sahab that he has asked the zonal officials to improve the time
 us aadesh kaa kya riselt niklaa, wo bataanaa chahie tha
 At that time, after listening to the Railway Minister, he felt that he had not heard it before
 pitiai ke hawaale se khabar ai he ki rail mantri ne sabhi zone pramukhon ko chetavanee di he ki agar ek maheene main trainon ke let chalane main sudhaar nahin hua he to unke pramotion ke dauraan moolyankan par asar padegaa
 While you heard the Railway Minister and Chairman Railway Board many times that the track capacity has not improved since 65 years, so trains are running late, will these zonal officers fix the problem of 65 years in a month
 rail mantri ko saaf kahana chahie ki samasya kahaan hai
 Is in track capacity or in the efficiency of the officers
 yaa samasya unke tarah tarah ke bayanon or faislon main he
 If the officials in Lethalifi can improve in a month for fear of stopping the promotion, then this work should have been done earlier so that many people are not harmed
 kya railmantri pehali baar jaage hai, pehali baar adhikariyon ko nirdesh de rahe hai, aisa bilkul nahin he
 He is well aware that on his Twitter handle, a large number of passengers complain of being late
 6 november 2017 ve apurva kumaar ke jawaab main likhte hai ki 'shukriya
 The government has made a lot of efforts to increase the timeliness of trains
 jinamein kshamta vistaar project or samay sarini kaa revizan bhi he
 'on 7 March 2018, tweet that' earlier there was a railway mentality that we are short of funds, then delay everything
 ab maansikta he ki har chiz ko aage badhaao or tezi se karo kyonki hamaare paas paryaapt fund he
 'on 7 March, tweeting that' the practice of recording manual punctuality in the Indian Railways was dropped from 41 major stations of all zones to increase the timeliness of trains and to inform the train status of the train at the right time
 Could
 ' 10 march ko rail mantri financial express kii story ko twit karte hai ki gudbai tu let trains yani trainon kaa let hone ko ab gudbai kah dijie
 Indian Railways has adopted these ten methods to ensure timeliness
 ' The story of the Financial Express that the Minister tweeted was that the Railway Minister wants the Indian Railways to be like the railroad of Switzerland where the watches are mixed from the time the train arrives
 ab main aapako yahaan ek tathy bataata hum, rail mantri ko to pataa hi hoga
 On 14 March, in the Parliament, the Ministry of Railways has responded that it is the policy of the railways that a vehicle reaching 15 minutes late is considered on time
 matlab 15 minute let ko aadhikarik rup se rhite time maanata he rail mantralay
 March tweets and his speeches from November show that it is in his mind to keep going late, but only he can tell what improved during this time
 unke pehle ke nirdeshon kaa kya nateeja niklaa
 On 14 March, the Minister of State for Railways has the answer in the Lok Sabha that 451 trains arrive late in the current financial year
 to phir us dauraan mantri ji ne kya ection liya, pramotion roak denge jaise hedline vaale bayaan se pehle ke unke bayanon kaa kya riselt niklaa
 We had shown in the rail series that patna-kota never lasts less than 20-25 hours
 ab usamen sudhaar aa gaya he
 But in the same Northern Railway between 10 April 2017 to 10 March 2018, 1341 Rajdhani Express arrived, 632 Duronto, 1425 Shatabdi late
 matlab viipi train bhi let se chal rahi hai or bhagalpur garib rath kaa haal to puuchhie hi mat
 The cycle will come
 pitiai ne pramotion vaali khabar main bataaya he ki sabase adhik train uttar bharat main chal rahi he
 The latency rate this year is 49
 59 pratishat he yani 50 pratishat trainen let chalati hai jabaki pichley saal 31
 74 percent trains were late
 ek saal main itani vruddhi kaise ho gai, rail mantri hi bataa sakate hai, kya koi nayaa project launch ho gaya, wo project kahaan launch hua he
 If the track is the reason, can the general manager of Northern Railway really improve the running time of the vehicles within a month
 unka beepi hai ho rahaa hoga, ham samajhate hai
 There is a report of Prabhat Khabar on 20 April 2018
 raksol se narkatiyaganj ke bich 42 kimi line par navinikaran, doharikaran or amman parivartan yani meter gej se broad gej karne kii yojana abhi tak adhuri he jabaki yah 1 april 2014 ko launch hui thi
 The 42 km line has not been built in five years
 lambii duuri ke liye is root ke logon ke liye train hi ekmaatr vikalp he
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has written on Kaura that '6 every day during the Modi government
 5 kimi ke hisaab linon ke navinikaran, doharikaran or parivartan ke project launch hote hai
 'accordingly, 981 between 1 January and 31 May this year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch hue honge
 Accordingly, 2372 in the whole year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch honge
 Do you know that in the 2018-19 budget, the target is to double the 18,000 km line
 is hisaab se 18000 kimi ke saamne 2375 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar kaa project kuch bhi nahin he
 There are plenty of statements but no evidence is found
 agar aap sunen ki upie ke samay 4
 5 km per day rail line project was launched and now 6
 5 kimi prati din launch ho rahaa he to jaldi prabhavit ho jaaenge magar yah to rail ke apane hi lakshya se bahut kam he
 In this way, if we review the statements of the Railway Minister, then the situation seems alarming
 sam pitroda cameti ne 2012 main suzav diya tha ki 2012-17 ke bich 18,000 kimi rail line ko aadhunik banaaya jaae
 We do not know what happened to that report and the target, whereas it would have cost the public money and time to make it
 kya 2018-19 main 18000 kimi trek kaa doharikaran, navinikaran or parivartan ho saktaa he? It is okay to have a big goal, but it should be true
 2014 se 2018 ke bich railway kul milakar 18000 kimi trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin kar pai to ek saal main kaise kar legi
 Looking at these figures, it seems that the statement is the proof
 pramaan benishaan hai
 There is something in the budget, there is something else in the Standing Committee
 koi padhata bhi he to yahaan hami log pard rahe hai khaskar shivank hi padhate rahete hai jinaki madad se in dastavezon tak pahunchaa hum
 There was a target of renovation of 2828 km old lines in 2016-17
 2017-18 ke liye bhi itnaa hi lakshya tha, donon kaa kya states he ham nahin jaanate
 The comments kya yah sab kuch hasil e hedline ke liye ho rahaa he
 If Piyush Goyal does not mind that i want to mention a statement of Ashwani Lohani which he has said in an interview to Doordarshan
 ve kehete hai ki mentanence par dhyaan diya ja rahaa he jo pichley saal tak puure tareeke se dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 This decision was taken when accidents occurred
 ab kar rahe hai
 Lohani also said that there was to be maintenance on the Lucknow and Mughalsarai lines, but it did not work
 isaki javabdehi kiski thi yaa kiski he
 Someone will explain why the track was not being maintained
 kyon isaki upeksha kii gai? kya pichley saal gaadiyaan let nahin chal rahi thim? hamane rail series main bataaya tha ki kai gaadiyaan ek-ek saal se 30-30 ghante let chal rahi thim
 The capital, Duranto Shatabdi, was also running late
 rail mantri ji 407 gaadiyaan shuru karne ko uplabdhi maanate hai, railway board ke chairman samasya yaa chunauti maanate hai
 It is better to talk to each other
 rail bajet, standing cameti, board chairman or rail mantri ek baat karen to thik rahegaa
 At least the Railway Minister and the Chairman of the Railway Board should talk among themselves
 agar rail mantralay hamaare tathyon ke sangyojan main kuch kamiyaan ujagar karata he to use chuttee se lautne ke baad zarur shaamil karuunga
 The report appeared in the New Indian Express on June 2 that the ticket cancellation has received Rs 2,760 crore from the Railways in the last two years
 yah aankada hairaan karne vaala he
 There is no charge for cancellation of tickets for air passenger, Jayant Sinha gives such a proposal, but Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has such strict rules of cancellation of tickets in the ministry that the common passenger is being looted
 jab trek par boj he to phir railmantri trainon ko launch kyon kar rahe hai
 At the same time, when they are calling the launch of new trains a problem, that is why on June 2, they are launching a Humsafar from Jodhpur to Banda, in a statement, they have said that the Bombay Chenna route has been single for 65 years
 magar us maarg par to train let nahin he
 Lohani has told Doordarshan that trains are mostly running late in the north
 ek maheene main jodhpur se yah duusari nai train chali he
 On that occasion you can hear in the speech of the minister how much he is worried about the time
 lagata he dinemic mantri ji prime time dekhne lage hai
 It is not about reasons, it is about focus
 agar is series se focus banataa he to phir thik he
 PTI reported on 30 May 2018 that the Railway Ministry has organized a two-day workshop in which all the top officials have attended
 is news main mishan raftaar kaa zikr he
 It was found out that the mission has been going on for three years, then why its result is bad towards North India
 pitiai kii khabar main he ki mishan raftaar ke tahat agle paanch saal main yatri gaadi or maal gaadi kii ausat raftaar main 25 kimi prati ghante kaa izaafaa kiya jayega
 The average speed of a passenger train is 44 km per hour and the average speed of a goods train is 25 km per hour
 internet par mili ek puraani khabar ke anusaar 2010 main rail mantri ke taur par mamata banerjee ne vijan 2020 launch kiya tha
 There was talk of running four bullet trains and the target was to increase the average speed of the remaining trains to 160-200 kmph
 magar piyush goyal to paanch saal main ausat raftaar 69 kimi prati ghante karnaa chaahate hai
 If there is no mistake in my understanding, then where did the vision 2020 that a railway minister had prepared by putting public money and what is his status
 ravivaar or somvaar ko aapane kai samachar patron or channelon par dekha hoga ki rail mantri ne railway ke sabhi 16 zone ke adhikariyon kii javabdehi tay kii he
 Many people started congratulating me that the rail series is taking effect
 jabaki isi tarah kii khabar lohani sahab ke naam se chap chuki he ki unhone zonal adhikariyon se kaha he ki samay main sudhaar karen
 What was the result of that order, they should have told
 tabhi rail mantri kii baat sunakar laga ki kahin pehle to nahin suna he
 The PTI was quoted as saying that the Railway Minister has warned all zone heads that if trains have not improved in a month, the evaluation will be affected during their promotion
 jabaki aapane rail mantri or chairman railway board ko kai baar kehete suna ki 65 saal se trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin hua isliye trainen let chal rahi hai to kya 65 saal kii samasya ye zonal adhikari ek maheene main thik kar denge
 The railway minister should clearly state where the problems lie
 trek kii kshamta main he yaa adhikariyon kii kaarykushalta main he
 Or the problem lies in their various statements and decisions
 agar letlatifi main adhikari pramotion rukne ke dar se ek maheene main sudhaar laa sakate hai to vaaki ye kaam pehle kiya janaa chahie tha taaki kai logon ko nuksaan nahin hota
 Is the Railway Minister awake for the first time, giving instructions to officers for the first time, is not so at all
 unhen thik se pataa he ki unke twitor handle par rose badi sankhya main yatri let hone kii shikaayat karte hai
 6 November 2017 He writes in response to Apoorva Kumar that 'thank you
 trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne bahut saare prayaas kiye hai
 Including revision of capacity expansion project and time table
 ' 7 march 2018 ko twit karte hai ki 'pehle railway kii maansikta thi ki hamaare paas fund kii kami he to sab kuch deree kar do
 Now the mindset is to pursue everything and do it fast because we have enough funds
 ' 7 march ko twit karte hai ki 'bhartiya rail main haath se samaybaddhata ko ricard karne kaa abhyaas sabhi zonon ke 41 bade steshnon se hataa diya gaya taaki trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaai ja sake or sawari ko sahi samay main train kii sthiti kii jaankaree di ja sake
 On March 10, the Railway Minister tweets the story of Financial Express that Goodbye to Late trains means that trains are late and now say Goodbye
 bhartiya railway ne samaybaddhata ko sunishchit karne ke liye ye das tareeke apanaae hai
 ' financial express kii jis story ko mantri ne twit kiya tha ki wo yah thi ki rail mantri chaahate hai ki bhartiya rail sweetsraland ke rail kii tarah honi chahie jahaan ghadiyaan train ke pahunchane ke time se milaai jaati hai
 Now let me tell you a fact here, the Railway Minister would know
 isi 14 march ko sansad main rail mantralay ne jawaab diya he ki rail kii niti he ki 15 minute kii deree tak pahunchane vaali gaadi ko samay par mana jaataa he
 That is, the Ministry of Railways officially considers 15 minutes late as Right Time
 nanvabar se march ke twit or unke bhaashan bataate hai ki let chalane kii baat unke dimag main he magar vahi bataa sakate hai ki is dauraan kya sudhaar hua
 What was the result of his earlier instructions
 14 march ko rail rajya mantri kaa hi jawaab he loksabhaa main ki maujuuda vitt varsh main har din 451 gaadiyaan deree se pahunchati hai
 Then what action did the minister take during that time, will stop the promotion like what was the result of his statements before the headline statement
 hamane rail series main dikhaaya tha ki patna-kota kabhi 20-25 ghate se kam let nahin chalati he
 Now it has improved
 lekin isi uttar railway main 10 april 2017 se 10 march 2018 ke bich 1341 rajdhani express, 632 duranton, 1425 shatabdi let se pahunchi
 Meaning VIP trains are also running late and do not ask the condition of Bhagalpur Garib Rath
 chakra aa jayega
 PTI has reported in the promotion news that the maximum number of trains are running in North India
 is saal let hone kii dar 49
 59 per cent means 50 per cent trains are late while 31 last year
 74 pratishat trainen let chali thim
 How has there been so much growth in a year, only the Railway Minister can tell, whether a new project has been launched, where has that project been launched
 agar trek kaaran he to kya uttar railway ke general manager ek maheene ke andar vaaki gadiyon ke samay se chalane main sudhaar kar sakate hai
 His BP must be getting high, we understand
 20 april 2018 ko prabhaat khabar kii ek report he
 The 42 km line between Raxaul to Narkatiaganj is still incomplete with plans to upgrade, doubling and gauge conversion from meter gauge to broad gauge, when it was launched on 1 April 2014
 paanch saal main 42 kimi line nahin ban pai he
 The train is the only option for people on this route for long distances
 rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaura par likhaa he ki 'modi sarkaar ke daur main har din 6
 Projects of renovation, doubling and conversion of 5 km lines are launched
 ' is hisaab se is saal 1 janvari se 31 may ke bich 981
 Projects to improve the capacity of the 5 km lines would have been launched
 is hisaab se puure saal main 2372
 Projects to improve capacity of 5 km lines will be launched
 kya aapako pataa he ki 2018-19 ke bajet main lakshya 18,000 kimi line ke dabl karne kaa he

 lekin isi uttar railway main 10 april 2017 se 10 march 2018 ke bich 1341 rajdhani express, 632 duranton, 1425 shatabdi let se pahunchi
 Meaning VIP trains are also running late and do not ask the condition of Bhagalpur Garib Rath
 chakra aa jayega
 PTI has reported in the promotion news that the maximum number of trains are running in North India
 is saal let hone kii dar 49
 59 per cent means 50 per cent trains are late while 31 last year
 74 pratishat trainen let chali thim
 How has there been so much growth in a year, only the Railway Minister can tell, whether a new project has been launched, where has that project been launched
 agar trek kaaran he to kya uttar railway ke general manager ek maheene ke andar vaaki gadiyon ke samay se chalane main sudhaar kar sakate hai
 His BP must be getting high, we understand
 20 april 2018 ko prabhaat khabar kii ek report he
 The 42 km line between Raxaul to Narkatiaganj is still incomplete with plans to upgrade, doubling and gauge conversion from meter gauge to broad gauge, when it was launched on 1 April 2014
 paanch saal main 42 kimi line nahin ban pai he
 The train is the only option for people on this route for long distances
 rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaura par likhaa he ki 'modi sarkaar ke daur main har din 6
 Projects of renovation, doubling and conversion of 5 km lines are launched
 ' is hisaab se is saal 1 janvari se 31 may ke bich 981
 Projects to improve the capacity of the 5 km lines would have been launched
 is hisaab se puure saal main 2372
 Projects to improve capacity of 5 km lines will be launched
 kya aapako pataa he ki 2018-19 ke bajet main lakshya 18,000 kimi line ke dabl karne kaa he
 Accordingly, there is nothing to improve the capacity of 2375 km lines in front of 18000 km
 bayaan to khub milte hai magar pramaan nahin milte hai
 If you hear that at the time of UPA 4
 5 kimi prati din rail line kaa project launch hota tha or ab 6
 Launching 5 km per day will affect you soon but it is far less than the rail's own goal
 is tarah se agar ham rail mantri ke bayanon kii samiksha karen to chintajanak sthiti nazar aati he
 The Sam Pitroda Committee suggested in 2012 that the 18,000 km railway line be modernized between 2012-17
 us report or lakshya kaa kya hua ham nahin jaanate jabaki use banane main janata kaa hi paisa or samay laga hoga
 Can 18000 km of track be doubled, refurbished and changed in 2018-19? lakshya bada ho thik he magar sahi to ho
 Between 2014 and 2018, the railways could not improve the total capacity of the 18000 km track, so how will it do in a year
 in aankadon ko dekh kar yahi lagata he ki bayaan hi pramaan he
 The evidence is poor
 bajet main kuch he, standing cameti main kuch or he
 Even if someone studies, our people are studying here, especially Shivank only keeps reading, with whose help i have reached these documents
 2016-17 main 2828 kimi puraani linon ke navinikaran kaa lakshya tha
 We had the same goal for 2017-18, we do not know what the status of both are
 tippaniyan Is this all happening for Achieve a Headline
 agar piyush goyal ko bura na lage ki ashvini lohani ke ek bayaan kaa zikr karnaa chahta hum jo unhone doordarshan ko die intervyuu main kaha he
 They say that attention is being paid to maintenance, which was not being given full attention till last year
 jab durghatnaayen huin tab ye nirnay liya gaya
 Doing now
 lohani ji ne yah bhi kaha ki lakhanu or mughalsarai line par mentanence hona tha magar uskaa kaam nahin hua
 Whose or whose responsibility was it? koi batayega ki trek kaa mentanence kyon nahin ho rahaa tha
 Why was it ignored? Were vehicles not running late last year? We had told in the rail series that many trains were running late for 30 hours every year
 rajdhani, duranton shatabdi bhi deree se chal rahi thim
 The Railway Minister considers the introduction of 407 vehicles as an achievement, the Chairman of the Railway Board considers the problem or challenge
 behatar he donon aapas main baat kar len
 Rail Budget, Standing Committee, Board Chairman and Railway Minister will be fine if we talk one thing
 kam se kam rail mantri or railway board ke chairman ko aapas main baat kar lenaa chahie
 If the Ministry of Railways reveals some shortcomings in the combination of our facts, we will definitely include it after returning from leave
 2 june ke new indian express main report chhapi he ki pichley do saal main railway ko tikat cancellesan ne 2,760 karod rupee mili hai
 This figure is surprising
 hawaii yatri ko tikat cancil karne se koi shulk nahin lagegaa, aisa prastaav jayant sinha dete hai magar rail mantri piyush goyal ke mantralay main tikat cancel karne ke itane kade niyam hai ki aam yatri lut rahaa he
 When there is a burden on the track, then why are the railway ministers launching trains
 jis samay ve nai trainon ke launch ko samasya bataa rahe hai usee samay yani 2 june ko jodhpur se banda ke liye humsafar ko launch kyon kar rahe hai jabaki ek bayaan main ve kah chuke hai ki bombai chenna maarg 65 saal se single padaa he
 But the train is not lying on that route
 lohani ji ne doordarshan se kaha he ki train zyaadaatar uttar main let chal rahi hai
 This is the second new train from Jodhpur in a month
 us maukey par mantri ji ke bhaashan main aap sun sakate hai ki ve samay ko lekar kitna pareshaan hai
 It seems that the dynamic minister has started watching prime time
 baat kaarnon kii nahin he, baat he focus kii
 If this series creates focus then it is fine
 pitiai ke hawaale se khabar ai he ki rail mantri ne sabhi zone pramukhon ko chetavanee di he ki agar ek maheene main trainon ke let chalane main sudhaar nahin hua he to unke pramotion ke dauraan moolyankan par asar padegaa
 While you heard the Railway Minister and Chairman Railway Board many times that the track capacity has not improved since 65 years, so trains are running late, will these zonal officers fix the problem of 65 years in a month
 rail mantri ko saaf kahana chahie ki samasya kahaan hai
 Is in track capacity or in the efficiency of the officers
 yaa samasya unke tarah tarah ke bayanon or faislon main he
 If the officials in Lethalifi can improve in a month for fear of stopping the promotion, then this work should have been done earlier so that many people are not harmed
 kya railmantri pehali baar jaage hai, pehali baar adhikariyon ko nirdesh de rahe hai, aisa bilkul nahin he
 He is well aware that on his Twitter handle, a large number of passengers complain of being late
 6 november 2017 ve apurva kumaar ke jawaab main likhte hai ki 'shukriya
 The government has made a lot of efforts to increase the timeliness of trains
 jinamein kshamta vistaar project or samay sarini kaa revizan bhi he
 'on 7 March 2018, tweet that' earlier there was a railway mentality that we are short of funds, then delay everything
 ab maansikta he ki har chiz ko aage badhaao or tezi se karo kyonki hamaare paas paryaapt fund he
 'on 7 March, tweeting that' the practice of recording manual punctuality in the Indian Railways was dropped from 41 major stations of all zones to increase the timeliness of trains and to inform the train status of the train at the right time
 Could
 ' 10 march ko rail mantri financial express kii story ko twit karte hai ki gudbai tu let trains yani trainon kaa let hone ko ab gudbai kah dijie
 Indian Railways has adopted these ten methods to ensure timeliness
 ' The story of the Financial Express that the Minister tweeted was that the Railway Minister wants the Indian Railways to be like the railroad of Switzerland where the watches are mixed from the time the train arrives
 ab main aapako yahaan ek tathy bataata hum, rail mantri ko to pataa hi hoga
 On 14 March, in the Parliament, the Ministry of Railways has responded that it is the policy of the railways that a vehicle reaching 15 minutes late is considered on time
 matlab 15 minute let ko aadhikarik rup se rhite time maanata he rail mantralay
 March tweets and his speeches from November show that it is in his mind to keep going late, but only he can tell what improved during this time
 unke pehle ke nirdeshon kaa kya nateeja niklaa
 On 14 March, the Minister of State for Railways has the answer in the Lok Sabha that 451 trains arrive late in the current financial year
 to phir us dauraan mantri ji ne kya ection liya, pramotion roak denge jaise hedline vaale bayaan se pehle ke unke bayanon kaa kya riselt niklaa
 We had shown in the rail series that patna-kota never lasts less than 20-25 hours
 ab usamen sudhaar aa gaya he
 But in the same Northern Railway between 10 April 2017 to 10 March 2018, 1341 Rajdhani Express arrived, 632 Duronto, 1425 Shatabdi late
 matlab viipi train bhi let se chal rahi hai or bhagalpur garib rath kaa haal to puuchhie hi mat
 The cycle will come
 pitiai ne pramotion vaali khabar main bataaya he ki sabase adhik train uttar bharat main chal rahi he
 The latency rate this year is 49
 59 pratishat he yani 50 pratishat trainen let chalati hai jabaki pichley saal 31
 74 percent trains were late
 ek saal main itani vruddhi kaise ho gai, rail mantri hi bataa sakate hai, kya koi nayaa project launch ho gaya, wo project kahaan launch hua he
 If the track is the reason, can the general manager of Northern Railway really improve the running time of the vehicles within a month
 unka beepi hai ho rahaa hoga, ham samajhate hai
 There is a report of Prabhat Khabar on 20 April 2018
 raksol se narkatiyaganj ke bich 42 kimi line par navinikaran, doharikaran or amman parivartan yani meter gej se broad gej karne kii yojana abhi tak adhuri he jabaki yah 1 april 2014 ko launch hui thi
 The 42 km line has not been built in five years
 lambii duuri ke liye is root ke logon ke liye train hi ekmaatr vikalp he
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has written on Kaura that '6 every day during the Modi government
 5 kimi ke hisaab linon ke navinikaran, doharikaran or parivartan ke project launch hote hai
 'accordingly, 981 between 1 January and 31 May this year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch hue honge
 Accordingly, 2372 in the whole year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch honge
 Do you know that in the 2018-19 budget, the target is to double the 18,000 km line
 is hisaab se 18000 kimi ke saamne 2375 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar kaa project kuch bhi nahin he
 There are plenty of statements but no evidence is found
 agar aap sunen ki upie ke samay 4
 5 km per day rail line project was launched and now 6
 5 kimi prati din launch ho rahaa he to jaldi prabhavit ho jaaenge magar yah to rail ke apane hi lakshya se bahut kam he
 In this way, if we review the statements of the Railway Minister, then the situation seems alarming
 sam pitroda cameti ne 2012 main suzav diya tha ki 2012-17 ke bich 18,000 kimi rail line ko aadhunik banaaya jaae
 We do not know what happened to that report and the target, whereas it would have cost the public money and time to make it
 kya 2018-19 main 18000 kimi trek kaa doharikaran, navinikaran or parivartan ho saktaa he? It is okay to have a big goal, but it should be true
 2014 se 2018 ke bich railway kul milakar 18000 kimi trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin kar pai to ek saal main kaise kar legi
 Looking at these figures, it seems that the statement is the proof
 pramaan benishaan hai
 There is something in the budget, there is something else in the Standing Committee
 koi padhata bhi he to yahaan hami log pard rahe hai khaskar shivank hi padhate rahete hai jinaki madad se in dastavezon tak pahunchaa hum
 There was a target of renovation of 2828 km old lines in 2016-17
 2017-18 ke liye bhi itnaa hi lakshya tha, donon kaa kya states he ham nahin jaanate
 The comments kya yah sab kuch hasil e hedline ke liye ho rahaa he
 If Piyush Goyal does not mind that i want to mention a statement of Ashwani Lohani which he has said in an interview to Doordarshan
 ve kehete hai ki mentanence par dhyaan diya ja rahaa he jo pichley saal tak puure tareeke se dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 This decision was taken when accidents occurred
 ab kar rahe hai
 Lohani ji also said that maintenance was to be done on Lucknow and Mughalsarai lines but his work was not done
 isaki javabdehi kiski thi yaa kiski he
 Someone will explain why the track was not being maintained
 kyon isaki upeksha kii gai? kya pichley saal gaadiyaan let nahin chal rahi thim? hamane rail series main bataaya tha ki kai gaadiyaan ek-ek saal se 30-30 ghante let chal rahi thim
 The capital, Duranto Shatabdi, was also running late
 rail mantri ji 407 gaadiyaan shuru karne ko uplabdhi maanate hai, railway board ke chairman samasya yaa chunauti maanate hai
 It is better to talk to each other
 rail bajet, standing cameti, board chairman or rail mantri ek baat karen to thik rahegaa
 At least the Railway Minister and the Chairman of the Railway Board should talk among themselves
 agar rail mantralay hamaare tathyon ke sangyojan main kuch kamiyaan ujagar karata he to use chuttee se lautne ke baad zarur shaamil karuunga
 The report appeared in the New Indian Express on June 2 that the ticket cancellation has received Rs 2,760 crore from the Railways in the last two years
 yah aankada hairaan karne vaala he
 There is no charge for cancellation of tickets for air passenger, Jayant Sinha gives such a proposal, but Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has such strict rules of cancellation of tickets in the ministry that the common passenger is being looted
 jab trek par boj he to phir railmantri trainon ko launch kyon kar rahe hai
 At the same time, when they are calling the launch of new trains a problem, that is why on June 2, they are launching a Humsafar from Jodhpur to Banda, in a statement, they have said that the Bombay Chenna route has been single for 65 years
 magar us maarg par to train let nahin he
 Lohani has told Doordarshan that trains are mostly running late in the north
 ek maheene main jodhpur se yah duusari nai train chali he
 On that occasion you can hear in the speech of the minister how much he is worried about the time
 lagata he dinemic mantri ji prime time dekhne lage hai
 It is not about reasons, it is about focus
 agar is series se focus banataa he to phir thik he
 Is the Railway Minister awake for the first time, giving instructions to officers for the first time, is not so at all
 unhen thik se pataa he ki unke twitor handle par rose badi sankhya main yatri let hone kii shikaayat karte hai
 6 November 2017 He writes in response to Apoorva Kumar that 'thank you
 trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne bahut saare prayaas kiye hai
 Including revision of capacity expansion project and time table
 ' 7 march 2018 ko twit karte hai ki 'pehle railway kii maansikta thi ki hamaare paas fund kii kami he to sab kuch deree kar do
 Now the mindset is to pursue everything and do it fast because we have enough funds
 ' 7 march ko twit karte hai ki 'bhartiya rail main haath se samaybaddhata ko ricard karne kaa abhyaas sabhi zonon ke 41 bade steshnon se hataa diya gaya taaki trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaai ja sake or sawari ko sahi samay main train kii sthiti kii jaankaree di ja sake
 On March 10, the Railway Minister tweets the story of Financial Express that Goodbye to Late trains means that trains are late and now say Goodbye
 bhartiya railway ne samaybaddhata ko sunishchit karne ke liye ye das tareeke apanaae hai
 ' financial express kii jis story ko mantri ne twit kiya tha ki wo yah thi ki rail mantri chaahate hai ki bhartiya rail sweetsraland ke rail kii tarah honi chahie jahaan ghadiyaan train ke pahunchane ke time se milaai jaati hai
 Now let me tell you a fact here, the Railway Minister would know
 isi 14 march ko sansad main rail mantralay ne jawaab diya he ki rail kii niti he ki 15 minute kii deree tak pahunchane vaali gaadi ko samay par mana jaataa he
 That is, the Ministry of Railways officially considers 15 minutes late as Right Time
 nanvabar se march ke twit or unke bhaashan bataate hai ki let chalane kii baat unke dimag main he magar vahi bataa sakate hai ki is dauraan kya sudhaar hua
 What was the result of his earlier instructions
 14 march ko rail rajya mantri kaa hi jawaab he loksabhaa main ki maujuuda vitt varsh main har din 451 gaadiyaan deree se pahunchati hai
 Then what action did the minister take during that time, will stop the promotion like what was the result of his statements before the headline statement
 hamane rail series main dikhaaya tha ki patna-kota kabhi 20-25 ghate se kam let nahin chalati he
 Now it has improved
 lekin isi uttar railway main 10 april 2017 se 10 march 2018 ke bich 1341 rajdhani express, 632 duranton, 1425 shatabdi let se pahunchi
 Meaning VIP trains are also running late and do not ask the condition of Bhagalpur Garib Rath

 jis samay ve nai trainon ke launch ko samasya bataa rahe hai usee samay yani 2 june ko jodhpur se banda ke liye humsafar ko launch kyon kar rahe hai jabaki ek bayaan main ve kah chuke hai ki bombai chenna maarg 65 saal se single padaa he
 But the train is not lying on that route
 lohani ji ne doordarshan se kaha he ki train zyaadaatar uttar main let chal rahi hai
 This is the second new train from Jodhpur in a month
 us maukey par mantri ji ke bhaashan main aap sun sakate hai ki ve samay ko lekar kitna pareshaan hai
 It seems that the dynamic minister has started watching prime time
 baat kaarnon kii nahin he, baat he focus kii
 If this series creates focus then it is fine
 hamane rail series main dikhaaya tha ki patna-kota kabhi 20-25 ghate se kam let nahin chalati he
 Now it has improved
 lekin isi uttar railway main 10 april 2017 se 10 march 2018 ke bich 1341 rajdhani express, 632 duranton, 1425 shatabdi let se pahunchi
 Meaning VIP trains are also running late and do not ask the condition of Bhagalpur Garib Rath
 chakra aa jayega
 PTI has reported in the promotion news that the maximum number of trains are running in North India
 is saal let hone kii dar 49
 59 per cent means 50 per cent trains are late while 31 last year
 74 pratishat trainen let chali thim
 How has there been so much growth in a year, only the Railway Minister can tell, whether a new project has been launched, where has that project been launched
 agar trek kaaran he to kya uttar railway ke general manager ek maheene ke andar vaaki gadiyon ke samay se chalane main sudhaar kar sakate hai
 His BP must be getting high, we understand
 20 april 2018 ko prabhaat khabar kii ek report he
 The 42 km line between Raxaul to Narkatiaganj is still incomplete with plans to upgrade, doubling and gauge conversion from meter gauge to broad gauge, when it was launched on 1 April 2014
 paanch saal main 42 kimi line nahin ban pai he
 The train is the only option for people on this route for long distances
 rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaura par likhaa he ki 'modi sarkaar ke daur main har din 6
 Projects of renovation, doubling and conversion of 5 km lines are launched
 ' is hisaab se is saal 1 janvari se 31 may ke bich 981
 Projects to improve the capacity of the 5 km lines would have been launched
 is hisaab se puure saal main 2372
 Projects to improve capacity of 5 km lines will be launched
 kya aapako pataa he ki 2018-19 ke bajet main lakshya 18,000 kimi line ke dabl karne kaa he
 Accordingly, there is nothing to improve the capacity of 2375 km lines in front of 18000 km
 bayaan to khub milte hai magar pramaan nahin milte hai
 If you hear that at the time of UPA 4
 5 kimi prati din rail line kaa project launch hota tha or ab 6
 Launching 5 km per day will affect you soon but it is far less than the rail's own goal
 is tarah se agar ham rail mantri ke bayanon kii samiksha karen to chintajanak sthiti nazar aati he
 The Sam Pitroda Committee suggested in 2012 that the 18,000 km railway line be modernized between 2012-17
 us report or lakshya kaa kya hua ham nahin jaanate jabaki use banane main janata kaa hi paisa or samay laga hoga
 Can 18000 km of track be doubled, refurbished and changed in 2018-19? lakshya bada ho thik he magar sahi to ho
 Between 2014 and 2018, the railways could not improve the total capacity of the 18000 km track, so how will it do in a year
 in aankadon ko dekh kar yahi lagata he ki bayaan hi pramaan he
 The evidence is poor
 bajet main kuch he, standing cameti main kuch or he
 Even if someone studies, our people are studying here, especially Shivank only keeps reading, with whose help i have reached these documents
 2016-17 main 2828 kimi puraani linon ke navinikaran kaa lakshya tha
 We had the same goal for 2017-18, we do not know what the status of both are
 tippaniyan Is this all happening for Achieve a Headline
 agar piyush goyal ko bura na lage ki ashvini lohani ke ek bayaan kaa zikr karnaa chahta hum jo unhone doordarshan ko die intervyuu main kaha he
 They say that attention is being paid to maintenance, which was not being given full attention till last year
 jab durghatnaayen huin tab ye nirnay liya gaya
 Doing now
 lohani ji ne yah bhi kaha ki lakhanu or mughalsarai line par mentanence hona tha magar uskaa kaam nahin hua
 Whose or whose responsibility was it? koi batayega ki trek kaa mentanence kyon nahin ho rahaa tha
 Why was it ignored? Were vehicles not running late last year? We had told in the rail series that many trains were running late for 30 hours every year
 rajdhani, duranton shatabdi bhi deree se chal rahi thim
 The Railway Minister considers the introduction of 407 vehicles as an achievement, the Chairman of the Railway Board considers the problem or challenge
 behatar he donon aapas main baat kar len
 Rail Budget, Standing Committee, Board Chairman and Railway Minister will be fine if we talk one thing
 kam se kam rail mantri or railway board ke chairman ko aapas main baat kar lenaa chahie
 If the Ministry of Railways reveals some shortcomings in the combination of our facts, we will definitely include it after returning from leave
 2 june ke new indian express main report chhapi he ki pichley do saal main railway ko tikat cancellesan ne 2,760 karod rupee mili hai
 This figure is surprising

 sam pitroda cameti ne 2012 main suzav diya tha ki 2012-17 ke bich 18,000 kimi rail line ko aadhunik banaaya jaae
 We do not know what happened to that report and the target, whereas it would have cost the public money and time to make it
 kya 2018-19 main 18000 kimi trek kaa doharikaran, navinikaran or parivartan ho saktaa he? It is okay to have a big goal, but it should be true
 2014 se 2018 ke bich railway kul milakar 18000 kimi trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin kar pai to ek saal main kaise kar legi
 Looking at these figures, it seems that the statement is the proof
 pramaan benishaan hai
 There is something in the budget, there is something else in the Standing Committee
 koi padhata bhi he to yahaan hami log pard rahe hai khaskar shivank hi padhate rahete hai jinaki madad se in dastavezon tak pahunchaa hum
 There was a target of renovation of 2828 km old lines in 2016-17
 2017-18 ke liye bhi itnaa hi lakshya tha, donon kaa kya states he ham nahin jaanate
 The comments kya yah sab kuch hasil e hedline ke liye ho rahaa he
 If Piyush Goyal does not mind that i want to mention a statement of Ashwani Lohani which he has said in an interview to Doordarshan
 ve kehete hai ki mentanence par dhyaan diya ja rahaa he jo pichley saal tak puure tareeke se dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 This decision was taken when accidents occurred
 ab kar rahe hai
 Lohani also said that there was to be maintenance on the Lucknow and Mughalsarai lines, but it did not work
 isaki javabdehi kiski thi yaa kiski he
 Someone will explain why the track was not being maintained
 kyon isaki upeksha kii gai? kya pichley saal gaadiyaan let nahin chal rahi thim? hamane rail series main bataaya tha ki kai gaadiyaan ek-ek saal se 30-30 ghante let chal rahi thim
 The capital, Duranto Shatabdi, was also running late
 rail mantri ji 407 gaadiyaan shuru karne ko uplabdhi maanate hai, railway board ke chairman samasya yaa chunauti maanate hai
 It is better to talk to each other
 rail bajet, standing cameti, board chairman or rail mantri ek baat karen to thik rahegaa
 At least the Railway Minister and the Chairman of the Railway Board should talk among themselves
 agar rail mantralay hamaare tathyon ke sangyojan main kuch kamiyaan ujagar karata he to use chuttee se lautne ke baad zarur shaamil karuunga
 The report appeared in the New Indian Express on June 2 that the ticket cancellation has received Rs 2,760 crore from the Railways in the last two years
 yah aankada hairaan karne vaala he
 There is no charge for cancellation of tickets for air passenger, Jayant Sinha gives such a proposal, but Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has such strict rules of cancellation of tickets in the ministry that the common passenger is being looted
 jab trek par boj he to phir railmantri trainon ko launch kyon kar rahe hai
 At the same time, when they are calling the launch of new trains a problem, that is why on June 2, they are launching a Humsafar from Jodhpur to Banda, in a statement, they have said that the Bombay Chenna route has been single for 65 years
 magar us maarg par to train let nahin he
 Lohani has told Doordarshan that trains are mostly running late in the north
 ek maheene main jodhpur se yah duusari nai train chali he
 On that occasion you can hear in the speech of the minister how much he is worried about the time

 The new counsel of seven Pakistani suspects involved in the attack before the fifth anniversary of the lashkar-e-taiba terror attacks on Mumbai claimed on Monday that the evidence provided by India was 'fake'
 lashkar-e-taiyaba ke commander jackieur rahamaan lakhvi or chah anya aropiyon ke vakil raja rigwan abbasi ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘bharat dwaara uplabdh karwaae gaye dastavej soochna hai, saboot nahin, jinaki adaalat ko jarurat he
 The evidence provided by India is fake
 ’ Reacting to the statement of the Pakistani prosecutors team expressing satisfaction with the evidence and finding conviction, Abbasi said, "this is what the prosecution is saying and this is what we feel

 He also cited flaws in the trial against Ajmal Kasab in India
 abbasi ne daawa kiya ki kasaab ne apana bayaan badal diya or daawa kiya ki use 26 november 2008 ke hamalon se 20 din pehle giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Asked that there are CCTV photographs and photographs of Kasab firing at people in Mumbai, Abbasi replied, 'no such evidence has been given to the court

 'the next hearing of the case will be on 27 November

 The most interesting thing is that Lalu will reach Bhagalpur with his two sons today
 patna se bhagalpur tak kaa safar lalu rail se tay karenge
 Lalu and his two sons will arrive in Bhagalpur at 10:30 pm in the intercity express that opens from Danapur to Bhagalpur at 4:40 pm

 Corporate greed ended the East India Company 2G and the coal scam drove UPA out of power
 The excess of anything is not good
 phir chaahe laalach ho, kaarobaar ho yaa phir technology
 Scottish historian William Dalrymple has tried to explain this in his new book, The Anarchy
 unka kahana he ki jis tarah corporate laalach ne east india company ko khatm kar diya, usee tarah 2G or koyala ghotaale ne congress kii satta khatm kar di
 The historian William Dalrymple in his book The Anarchy has told the entire story of the rise and rise of the East India Company from its inception to its end
 unhone bataaya ki landan kii kaarobaari east india company ne kis tarah mughal satta par kabja kar liya or itani shaktishaalee ban gai
 East India overthrew the Mughal Empire and claimed that the East India Company was founded in London in the year 1600 to do business in the Indian continent
 is company kaa vistaar itnaa hua ki isane bhartiya upmahadweep ke bade hisse, dakshin purv asia ke upniveshit hisse or king china ke saath yuddh ke baad honkong main kabja kar liya
 This company took over power by ending the powerful Mughal Empire in India
 wiliam delerimpal ne apni kitaab 'di anarki' main is dhaaran kaa bhi khandan kiya ki bharat kaa upniveshikaran britain ke rashtriya project kii shuruyaat thi
 Indeed, the purpose of establishing the East India Company was to increase corporate profits through the private joint stock company, which later became the cause of India's colonization
 wiliam delerimpal ne kaha ki ham corporate phaayde ke laalach main aksar itihaas or nuksaan ko bhul jate hai
 How Marwari and Jain bankers helped British company William Delrimple said that when the East India Company came to India, it started its operations with the help of Marwari and Jain bankers of Bengal
 east india company ne marwari or jain bankeron kii sahaayta se apane kaamkaaj ko dhire-dhire aage badhaayaa
 Its Hindu bankers from Patna and Banaras also helped the East India Company
 is tarah bharat main east india company ko badhaane main bharatiyon ne milakar madad kii
 Offering money to overthrow Mughal power, Jagat Seth, the richest Indian banker at the time, encouraged the British to overthrow the power of Siraj-ud-daula, the Nawab of Bengal
 saath hi aisa karne ke liye 20 lakh euro dene kii peshkash kii thi
 The East India Company knew that the Mughals could be defeated with Indian soldiers and money
 ab yahaan sawaal yah uthta he ki kya hindu kaarobaariyon ke dil main muslim shaskaon ke prati nafrat thi, jiske chalate unhone mughal shashan ko khatm karne ke liye east india company ko paisa diya? unhone kaha ki yah puri tarah sach nahin hai
 He says that Jagat Seth felt that his money was more secure with the East India Company than the Mughals
 yah behad dilachasp he ki kis tarah corporate hinsa ne mughal samrajya ko khatm kar diya
 How did the East India Company capture India? William Dalrymple said that on 31 December 1600 the British Government approved the establishment of the East India Company
 iske baad east india company ummiido se bhi zyada teji se aage badi
 Through this, Britain's dominance in the field business was established
 iske baad company kaa satta main dakhal badhane laga or dhire-dhire east india company ne satta, kanoon vyavastha or puure desh main kabja kar liya
 The company began to legislate and fight until the war
 east india company se chhin gai hindustan kii sattadellerimpal ke mutabik zyaadaatar itihaaskaar mughalkaal or phir swatantraaa sangram par zyada focus karte hai, wo east india company par zyada focus nahin karte hai
 However, England at the time was aware of the growing threat of corporate greed
 agar us samay ke british akhbaar ko ulatakar dekha jaae, to us samay kii media ne isaki aalochana bhi kii thi
 William Dalrymple says that there was also a debate in the British Parliament over corporate greed, which discussed how the East India Company occupied such a large area
 iske baad east india company ne british sansad main apana vishwaas kho diya or british sarkaar ne bharat kii satta east india company se chhinakar apane haath main le liya
 Greed seems to be hitting power, corporatewilliam Delimple said that corporate gets more greedy than getting more profit
 iske baad vah sarkaar or satta se takaraane lagata he
 He said that 2G and coal scams happened in the UPA regime, due to which the Congress had to lose power
 wiliam delerimpal kii 'di anarki' sirf itihaas kii kitaab hi nahin he, balki belgaum corporate se hone vaale nuksaan kii yaad dilaataa he

 Pakistan has arrested 34 Indian fishermen for violating the country's water limits
 isse kareeb 10 din pehle sadbhaavna dikhaate hue pakistan ne bharat ke 60 kaidiyon ko reeha kiya tha
 a spokesman for the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency said that the fishermen were arrested on May 7 and they have been handed over to the local police
 pravaktaa ne bataaya, ‘‘ unhen nyaayik magistrate ke samaksh pesh kiya jayega jo unhen nyaayik hiraasat main bhejne par faisla karenge
 "this is the first time since January this year that the Maritime Security Agency has arrested Indian fishermen
" piem imran khan kii taharik-e-insaaf pakistan kii sabase amir party, ye he kul sampattipakistan ne janvari main paanch gujarati machuaaron ko giraftaar kiya tha or unhen jail bhej diya gaya tha
 Amid tensions between the two countries against the backdrop of the terror attack in Pulwama, on 29 April Pakistan released 55 Indian fishermen and five civilians under 'goodwill'
 pakistan: lahore main sufi dargah ke paas bada dhamaakaa, 3 kii maut or 15 ghayalpakistan sarkaar ne pichley maheene karachi kii landhi or malir jelon se 250 se zyada machuaaron ko reeha kiya tha
 The fishermen were released in three stages
 pakistan ke videsh mantralay ne pehle elaan kiya tha ki sadbhaavna ke tahat april main, chaar alag-alag samoohon main 360 bhartiya machuaaron ko reeha kiya jayega
 In Pakistan, girls are being trafficked from the church, clergy are making deals
 
 
 pakistan or bharat aksar machuaaron ko giraftaar karte hai kyonki arab sagar main samudri seemaa kaa koi spasht simakan nahin he or in machuaaron ke paas apni sateek sthiti jaanane ke liye takanic se las naaven nahin hai
 Due to long and slow bureaucracy and legal procedures, fishermen typically remain in prison for several months and sometimes years
 janvari main bharat or pakistan ne kaidiyon kii suchi kii adla-badali kii thi jiske tahat bhartiya jelon main 347 pakistani kaidi hai, jinamein se 249 naagarik or 98 machuaare bataae gaye hai
 input language purv justise abhaya thipse ne jaj loya kii sandigdh maut par bhi sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki maamla supreme court main he is par zyada bolnaa thik nahin he, lekin unka nijee mat he ki maut swaabhaavik he yaa aswabhaavik sirf is par focus karnaa thik nahin he
 There is so much irregularity in the trial and there are other allegations which i have read that if someone was approaching them, then they should be investigated
 uske liye loya jo phone istemaal karte the askaa sidiaar nikaalkar jaanch karenge to kuch effective usame suraag mil saktaa he or sach baahar aa saktaa he
 It is evident that the investigation of Sohrabuddin's fake encounter, not just the accused, but also the throat of the investigation agency, the court has become so entangled that it has become common to raise doubts and questions at every step in the case

 purvi dilli nagar nigam kii standing cameti ne ek prastaav diya gaya he ki chunki shaam ko nagar nigam ke adhiktar skool band rahete hai aise main koching sanchaalkon ko shaam kii paali main skool building kiraye par di ja sakati hai
 Although it is only proposal now, it is believed that the proposal will be approved in the coming few days
 purvi dilhinagar nigamake pravaktaa yogendra maan ne bataaya ki nagar nigam ke 350 se zyada praathmik vidhyalay hai or adhiktar main keval ek paali main hi padhai hoti he aise main pratham paali ke baad skulon kii yah building khaali padi rahati he
 Court's order referred to: The Standing Committee of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation cited the court order in its resolution stating that the school building can be used only for teaching work and for anything other than school building
 Cannot be used yahi vajah he ki keval koching centres ke liye in skulon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Two targets with one stone There are two big reasons behind this proposal of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation Standing Committee
 The first proposal states that the opening of coaching centers will help the backward students in their studies, which can improve their education and make them far away
 Will not even have to go
 vahiin doosraa kaaran yah bataaya gaya he ki nagar nigam kii vittiya haalat bahut kharaab he koching centres ko skool kii building kiraye par dene se nagar nigam ko kuch aay ho sakati
 Municipal Corporations running in losses The three municipal corporations of Delhi are running in full deficit
 jisamen sabase zyada purvi dilli nagar nigam kii sthiti jarjar he
 The problem of loss is that many times the East Delhi Municipal Corporation has a budget deficit of about 2500 crores and the payment of 1500 crores is pending, in such a situation, the Standing Committee of East Delhi Municipal Corporation has proposed this but also all kinds of questions on it

 agar aap bhi ye sochati hai ki shaadi ke baad sabakuch vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa romantic filmon main dikhaaya jaataa he to ekbar kisi shaadishuda mahila se jarur milen
 Normally, there are different types of fairy tales going on in the minds of virgin girls
 unhen lagata he ki shaadi ke baad har ladki ko ek aisa saath mil jaataa he jo uskaa khyaal rakhata he, pyaar karata he, shopping par le jaataa he, chaay banaakar detaa he or na jane kya-kya
 
 
 Such girls must meet those girls who have just been married
 har ladki apni shaadi or uske baad kii jindagi ko lekar tarah-tarah ke sapane sajaati he par hakeekat yahi he ki asli jindagi sapanom kii duniya se bahut alag hoti he
 These are the 11 things that every girl must know before marriage
 1
 If you are bored by having parties, moving around with friends and now want to get married and live with one such person who takes care of you then it is better that you do not get married
 aapako ye sab paane ke liye ghar ke har chote-bade kaam kii jimmedaari uthaani padegi or agar aap iske liye taiyaar nahin hai to shaadi aapke liye nahin he
 2
 shaadi ke baad jindagi puri tarah se badal jaati he
 Sometimes you have to forget your choice and prioritize relationships
 log hameshaa aapse aapke sau fisadi kii ummid karte hai par wo aapke liye bhi sochen ye jaruri nahin he
 3
 agar aapmen sahansheeltaa nahin he to shaadi aapke liye nahin he kyonki shaadi ke baad aapako kisi raat apane pati ke kharrate sunne padate hai to kisi din dinabhar madar in lau ko khush karne ke liye kichan main khadaa hona padataa he
 4
 shaadi ke baad kai aise maukey aate hai jab aapako jabardastee hami bharani padati he
 Even if you do not like something, you have to answer yes
 5
 Life after marriage is completely different from fairy tales
 jaruri nahin he ki har roj aapke or aapke partner ke bich romantic baaten hi hon
 Along with love, fighting is also a special aspect of this relationship
 6
 Even before marriage, even if you are going to tell the truth and lie to the truth, most girls have to become diplomats after marriage
 7
 If you think that you can keep everyone happy then you are wrong
 aap chaahe kuch bhi kar len aap har kisi ko khush nahin rakh saktin
 8
 shaadi ke baad aap or aapkaa partner hameshaa pyaar bhari baaten karen ye jaruri nahin
 There are many occasions after marriage when the conversation between you and your partner stops
 9
 After marriage, there are many occasions when it seems that both of you are husband and wife only
 10
 If your relationship has deteriorated, do not even expect that one day a miracle will happen suddenly and everything will be fixed
 11
 After marriage, you have to accept many things that you would be very irritated about before
