 The third ODI of the series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be played in Colombo on Sunday
 5 match kii vanade series main philhal donon tiimon ke khate main ek-ek jeet he or series barabari par he
 In such a situation, Pakistan and Sri Lanka will try to win the third ODI and take the lead in the series
 colombon main pakistan ke saamne mohammad hafeez par isisi dwaara lagaae gaye bain se nipatane kii bhi chunauti hogi
 The role of spinner is important on Sri Lankan pitches, this has been proved in the first ODI
 pehle vanade main hafeez ne 41 ran dekar 4 wicket liye jisaki vajah se pakistan ko 6 wicket se jeet mili
 After the ICC ban, Pakistan will have to find new ways to stop Sri Lankan batsmen
 match se pehle srilankai captain anzolo maitheus ne kaha, 'pakistan ke liye mushkil hoga, phir bhi ham virdohi team ko halke main nahin le sakate
 ' agar isisi ranking kii baat karen to pakistan maujuuda ranking main number 9 par he
 Pakistan will have to win the series under any circumstances to qualify for the Champions Trophy
 pehle vanade main pakistan kaa pradarshan kaafii acha rahaa
 The batsmen and bowlers combined to win the team, but in the second ODI the team derailed
 captain azhar ali, shoeb malik or mohammad rigwaan ne ardhshtak banaakar scoreboard par ran batore lekin gendbaaz ran rokane main naakaam rahe
 On the other hand, for Sri Lanka, Kusal Perera is in no good boon
 perera ne duusare vanade main sirf 17 gend par tej ardhshtak banaakar sabko prabhavit kiya
 Captain Matthews will also expect a banging innings from Perera
 srilanka ke liye agar koi pareshaani kii baat he to wo he team ke medil order ballebzon kaa form
 The openers are giving a good start but the middle order is not experienced in the innings
 kumaar sangakara or mahela jayavardhane ke sanyas ke baad se team ko is samasya kaa hal nikaala zaruri ho gaya he
 Also Sri Lankan players are sluggish in the field which has also been accepted by the captain
 ballebaazon or gendbaazon ne milakar team ko jeet dilaai, lekin duusare vanade main team patari se utar gai
 Captain Azhar Ali, Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Rizwan scored runs on the scoreboard with a half-century but the bowlers failed to stop the run
 duusari taraf srilanka ke liye kusal perera kaa shandaar form main hona kisi vardaan se kam nahin he
 Perera impressed everyone in the second ODI by scoring a fast half-century off just 17 balls
 captain maitheus ko aage bhi perera se dhamaakedaar pari kii ummid rahegi
 If there is any problem for Sri Lanka, then it is the form of the team's middle order batsmen
 opebers sahi shuruyaat de rahe hai lekin medil order ko pari sanbhale kaa anubhav nahin he
 Since the retirement of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, the team has found a solution to this problem
 iske alaava srilankai khilaadi field main sust hai jo captain bhi sweekaar kar chuke hai

 When actress Tanushree Dutta reminded Indians of her alleged sexual harassment from Nana Patekar on the sets of the movie Horn Ok Please nearly a decade ago, Bollywood professionals responded not as # metoo, but as # ibelieveher
 yah hashtag is baat kaa saboot he ki bollywood abhi hollywood kii tarah misaal pesh karne main kaaphi peeche he
 In a similar case in Hollywood, there was a lot of uproar and many stars like Producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Kevin Spacey, comedian Bill Cosby stopped getting public and entertainment industry support and faced legal action
 datta kii kahani ko charchaa milani tab shuru hui, jab aaj tak or hedlins today main tab reporter raheen jenis sequera ne unki baat kii pushti kii or us film kii assistant diarector shaini shetty ne bhi unka samarthan kiya
 After this, Priyanka Chopra, Farhan Akhtar, Sonam Kapoor, Swara Bhaskar also supported Dutta
 in tippaniyon ke baavjood aisa lag rahaa he ki bollywood ne sajishan chuppi saadh lee he
 There will be no # timesup movement here and celebs nor any award show will come in black clothes to show solidarity towards the victims
 film jagat ke amitabh bachchan jaise diggajon ke liye to chuppi main hi param sukh he
 On the occasion of the launch of the trailer of the upcoming film Thugs of Hindostan, he appeared to avoid getting involved in any controversy
 unki feeki-si pratikriya thi, ''na to meraa naam tanushri he or na hi naanaa patekar
 Incidentally, Bachchan is the ambassador of Sarkar's 'beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' movement and has won several awards for his role in Pink
 is film ke pramotion ke liye to unhone apni grand dotrs ko aagaah karte hue ek lambii chitthee likhi thi ki unhen mushkil bhari duniya main palanaa-baduya he
 Actress Raveena Tandon reacted most strongly after Dutta's allegations
 unhone twit kiyah ''sach to yah he ki is industry kii kai patniyaan / garlfriend tab mookadarshak yaa hausala badhaane vaali hi rahati hai, jab unke abhinayta pati kisi abhinetri ke peeche padane or usase flert kaa khel khelkar uske kariyar ko tabah karte hai or uski jagah koi nayaa shikaar dhund lete hai
 Our motive for making films on all these women empowerment proves to be hollow
 '' bollywood ke doharepan par tandon kaa prahaar bilkul sahi he
 After voicing Dutta, filmmaker and choreographer Farah Khan shared a photo on Instagram, showing the cast of his upcoming film Housefull 4, directed by his brother Sajid
 usamen naanaa patekar bhi hai
 Twinkle Khanna gave her support to Dutta, but her husband Akshay Kumar is working with Patekar in this film
 renuka shahane jaisi adaakara ne yah sweekaar kiya ki kai mardon or auraton ko naanaa patekar ke gusse kaa shikaar hona padaa he, par patekar ke bahishkaar jaisi koi apil saamne nahin ai he
 Punishment is far from over, the film industry has not even been willing to reprimand men who are violent or behaving badly
 saal 2002 main aishwarya raay ne ek bhavuk bayaan jari kar apane purv boyfriend salmaan khan ke saath kaam karne se inkaar kiya tha, ''apni bhalaai, apni samajhadaari ke liye
 Aishwarya said that in the two-year relationship, she has endured Salman's excessive drinking habits and her 'literal, physical and mental' abuse
 iske baavjood salmaan vyaavhaarik rup se bedaag rahe
 Dutta is being discouraged and maligned by saying that she is doing all this for publicity after returning from America
 ve philhal america main settle hai
 Dutta is a rebel and demanding action, due to which his critics are growing angry
 lagata he, bollywood is samasya kaa koi samaadhaan nahin chahta he
 As of July 2018, only seven production houses have agreed to set up a sexual harassment cell at the workplace as per the Sexual Harassment Act
 pichley saal, ek mahila assistant ne vikaas bahal par chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The incident was forgotten and Bahl got a chance to direct Hrithik Roshan in a film on the life of Super 30 founder Anand Kumar
 kya datta ko doosraa mauka milegaa? kya koi aage bad kar unke kariyar ko phir se sanvaarane main madad karegaa jinhone industry ke gande rahasy ko ujagar kar diya he? richa chaddha kahati hai, ''chuppi ek vikalp ban gaya he
 '' this is true
 industry main tike rahane ke liye abhinetriyaan lambey vakt se iskaa sahaara le rahi hai
 But right now its walls, it is expected that one day they will dare to speak

 " Unlike Manmohan Singh, Narendra Modi cannot be called an 'accidental PM' (coincidentally Prime Minister)
 unka utthan isse behatar or kya ho saktaa tha
 The BJP announced him as the prime ministerial candidate in mid-september 2013
 chah maheene kaa aisa vyapak prachaar abhiyaan desh main isse pehle kabhi dekha nahin gaya tha
 In the campaign for nine-phase voting for the 36-day 16th Lok Sabha between 7 April and 12 May, Modi traveled more than 300,000 kilometers, addressed around 430 rallies and attended about 5,800 public events
 prachaar kaa focus sushasan or vikaas ke vaade par tha
 The mandate also came as a confidence vote for the NDA and Modi
 iske saath lagaataar kai trishanku janadesh kaa itihaas bhi tut gaya
 The BJP alone won 282 seats and got an absolute majority to run the government
 pichhali baar kisi ek party ko mukammal janadesh teen dashak pehle 1984 main congress ko hi mila tha
 This mandate is an undeniable change in the history of political selection of the country
 bijepi ko mili 31
 5 percent of the vote is the highest in its history and 19
 6 pratishat ke saath congress kii vot hissedari uske itihaas main sabase kam he
 Surprisingly this is only equal to bjp's vote percentage in 2009
 congress ke khilaaf voton kaa rujhaan (9 pratishat) bhi vahi he jo uske khilaaf 1971 se 1977, or 1984 se 1989 ke dauraan dekha gaya tha
 But this time the already low base pushed him down to less than 20 percent
 isse party ko mili voton kaa siton main badalanaa mushkil ho gaya
 12 in favor of BJP
 7 fisadi kaa rujhaan bhi desh ke chunavi itihaas main apratyaashit tha
 This is one-and-a-half times the trend towards BJP in 1989 and 1991 and this has started showing strength in the 'modi wave'
 endie kii jeet kii ekmaatr vajah bijepi kaa behtareen pradarshan he
 Although bjp's allies in the NDA were able to increase their nominal vote share on their own, their seats doubled from 25 to 53
 congress ko 16veen loksabhaa main sirf 44 siten hi milin, jo rahul ke pita divangat rajeev gandhi ko indira hatyakand (1984) main mili 404 siton kaa mahaj aathvaan hissaa he
 This is much less than the 114 seats of the Congress when the NDA came to power for the first time
 so, kul siton ke 10 pratishat se bhi kam siten paane kii vajah se congress ke sansadeey dal ke netaa ko samvidhan ke mutabik vipaksh ke netaa kii manyata bhi hasil nahin hogi!uttar or pashchim main baari uthal-puthalbijepi kii aguai vaale endie ko uttar (dilli, uttarakhand, haryana, rajasthan or uttar pradesh) or pashchim (chhattisgarh, goa, gujarat, madhya pradesh or maharashtra) se siton kaa apratyaashit laabh hua
 The North added 101 seats from 14 to 115, while the West increased the number from 61 to 106 by giving an additional 45 seats
 uttar pradesh main mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party (bispi) ko ek bhi seat nahin mili jabaki 2009 main use 20 siten mili thim
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party (SP) came down to five and Congress got only two seats of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party (aap) ne 2013 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaavon main jabardast jeet hasil kii thi lekin is baar use khaskar dilli or varanasi ke shahari kendron main bijepi ke liye khatra mana gaya
 Modi was contesting from Varanasi
 aap ko shaayad uske dilli main 49 dinon main sarkaar chhod dene or kuch gadbaditon kaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa
 It only got four seats in Punjab
 purab (orissa, assam, bihar, jharkhand or pashchim bengal) main bhi endie ko acchhee badhat mili
 Its seats in these states increased from 25 to 53
 bihar main pehle kii 12 se 31 siton par pahunch janaa khaskar isliye mahatvapurn he kyonki nitish kumaar ke jedy (you) ke saath uskaa 17 saal kaa gathbandhan tutaa tha
 Nothing miracle could happen after that
 bijepi to modi lahar ke dam par apni naiya paar kar le gai lekin jedy (you) to nestnabud ho gaya, lalu prasad yadav kii argedy ko sirf chaar siten milin jo 2009 ke baraabar hi he
 In West Bengal, the CPM slipped to just two seats and 22
 7 fisadi voton tak hi simatakar rah gai
 It had nine seats and 33 seats in 2009
 1 fisadi vot mili the
 This time the CPM has just 9 members in the Lok Sabha due to lack of favorable results in Kerala
 (bijepi ko kisne-kisne chunaa)mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress ne 34 (19 se badhkar) siton ke saath pashchim bengal par apni pakad or majboot bana lee he or 1980 ke dashak main vam morcha kii tarah lagane lagi he
 This party has vigorously knocked there
 bijepi ke liye bhi vahaan se acchhee khabar haath lagi he
 The saffron party won 6 percent of its vote there
 1 se dogune se zyada badhaakar 16
 9 percent tax
 shaayad vah rajya main mukhya vipakshi dal banane kii ore agrasar he
 In the south (andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu), BJP kept its deficit in Karnataka at two and in alliance with Chandra Babu Naidu in Andhra, gained 13 seats
 tamilnadu main 2ji ghotaale or paariwarik kalah se post diemke kii siten 18 se shunya ho gayi
 Although his vote percentage is 25
 1 se 23
 Coming at 3 fell a bit
 je
 Jayalalithaa's AIADMK seized 37 of the 39 seats in Tamil Nadu
 uskaa yah pradarshan behatar rahaa he, or hameshaa kii tarah tamilnadu kii janata ne ekatarfa nattejey hi kisi ek parrty ko die hai
 Indications are that the Congress has maintained its Muslim and Sikh vote banks but has lost support (7 to 9 per cent) among all sections of Hindus
 bijepi ne musalamaanon main apni lokapriyata kareeb 9 fisadi tak badha lee he
 The stakes of bjp's 'cultural harmony' and 'development agenda' have probably been raised by the heads of Scheduled Castes (SC) and Tribes (ST)
 shaayad 17 se 20 fisadi essi-asti ne use vot diya he
 (why Congress collapsed) In the age group, the Congress has been able to maintain its base among the youth below 25 years, while the middle and above age people seem to lose 5-7 per cent
 duusari ore, bijepi sabhi aayu varg main pakad banaati lag rahi he (use 11-18 pratishat) kaa laabh hua he
 bjp's popularity is most among the youth and its losses are being felt to other parties besides Congress
 congress ke roti, kapadaa or makaan ke agenda se bijepi kaa sadak, bijli, pani kaa agenda shaayad mukhar madhyavarg se atirikt vot bator laayaa he
 There is no indication of a difference in gender bias in voting
 purushon or mahilaon, donon kaa jhukaav bijepi kii ore he
 Votes for different sections of income, education, caste, gender and age have not shown any difference in trends
 yah sakaaratmak rujhaan he or pahchaan kii raajnneeti ke khatm hone kaa bhi puri tarah se sanket he
 The 2014 Lok Sabha results raise two important questions: what will the new NDA government be able to fulfill in the campaign, the promises that raise aspirations? And what changes will the Congress bring to overcome the crisis that has come to its existence? Wait a few more months to know the answers to these
 lekhak arthshaastri or chunaav vishleshak hai There will be new assembly elections in Delhi

 alji ne kendriya grahamantralay ko dilli ke raajnneetik halaat par report bheji thi, jisamen vidhansabha bhang kar nae chunaav kii sifarish kii gai thi
 This situation was created because no political party, including the largest party in Delhi, was ready to form the government
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ne kaha ki dilli main party chunaav ke liye puri tarah taiyaar he
 Will contest elections under collective leadership
 party chunaav ladegi or dilli main good gavarnence or acchhee sarkaar degi
 This is our commitment
 congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaha ki ham log to hameshaa chaahate the ki dilli main chunaav hon, swaagat he

 In order to compete with the BJP, the SP-BSP has allotted seats in alliance, so the majority of the 22 Lok Sabha seats in West Uttar Pradesh have gone to the Bahujan Samaj Party
 11 siton par bahujan samaaj party (gautamabuddha nagar, gajiabad, meerut-hapur, bulandshahr, agra, fatehpur sikri, saharanpur, amroha, bijanour, nagina or aligarh) chunaav ladegi
 While Samajwadi Party (hathras, Kairana, Moradabad, Sambhal, Rampur, Mainpuri, Firozabad and Etah) on 8 seats and the remaining 3 seats went to the Rashtriya Lok Dal (baghpat, Muzaffarnagar and Mathura)

 In western Uttar Pradesh, the SP-BSP has formally announced alliances and seats which can give a tough challenge to the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as the BJP has 71 out of 80 seats (currently 68 seats) in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 
 bhaajapa ne 2018 main apni 3 loksabhaa siten phulpur, kairana or gorakhpur gathbandhan ke kaaran hi khoi thi or 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke aankado ke mutabik sapa-basapa donon kaa kul vot yaa to bhaajapa se aage rahi he yaa bahut kam antar se haari he
 That is, the result of arithmetic in the elections, the danger bells have been ringed for the BJP in western Uttar Pradesh

 america sansad kii ek report main kaha gaya he ki pakistan ne dashakon se afghanistan main ek sakriy lekin nakaaratmak bhoomika nibhaai he or islamabad kabul main ek kamjor sarkaar chahta he
 The Congressional Research Service (CRS) in its latest report on Afghanistan has described Pakistan as the most important neighbor of Afghanistan
 report main kaha gaya he ki pakistan ne kai dashakon tak afghanistan ke maamalon main sakriy, lekin kai lihaaj se ek nakaaratmak bhoomika nibhaai
 The CRS produces reports for US lawmakers on important topics, so that they can make easy decisions
 is report main kaha gaya he, ‘‘pakistan kii suraksha sevaaon ne afghanistan ke vidrohi samoohon, vishesh rup se hakkaani network, ke saath sambandh banaae rakhe, jo america dwaara ghoshit ek videshi aatanki sanghathan (pato) he or ab aadhikarik rup se taliban kaa ek ardh-swytt ghatak ban gaya he
 "the CRS report says," Pakistan prefers a weak and unstable Afghanistan rather than a strong and unified Afghanistan (especially leading a Pashtun-dominated government in Kabul)
 ''bharat ke bare main report main kaha gaya he, ‘‘afghanistan main bharat kii kootnithik or vanijyik upasthiti he, or america iskaa samarthan karata he tathaa isse pakistan ko gherebandi kii chintaa sataati he
 India's interests in Afghanistan are largely related to its extensive regional rivalry with Pakistan

 kaise hamaare pet main hansate-hansate bal pad jaaya karte the
 How we used to tickle our friends and younger siblings
 ham samay bitne ke saath-saath bade to hote gaye magar kabhi is baat par gaur nahin kiya ki aakhir hamen gudagudi kyon hoti he, or vah bhi sharir ke kinhin vishesh hisson me
 After all, why touching someone's stomach is tickling, but touching on the head does nothing
 aakhir kya he gudagudi ke peeche kaa science?scientist kehete hai ki hansate to ham kisi chutkule yaa majaak par bhi hai, magar gudagudi kii baat kuch or hoti he
 Here is the case of skin and touch
 skin ke sabase bahari parat koepidermiskehate hai
 The epidermis attaches spontaneously to several nerves

 One that analyzes the touch and one who regulates the pleasurable things
 saamaanya taur par dekhen to insaan ko aise jagahon par gudagudi adhik hoti he jo haddi se kam-se-kam ghira hota he (pet or pair ke talave)
 Scientists believe that tickling is the process of protecting oneself
 aisa karne se sharir sikudta he or sharir kam-se-kam bahari sampark main aata he
 Can humans tickle themselves? This is a common question that often comes in people's minds
 ham dusron ko gudagudi karne ke baad khud par bhi wo saare trick istemaal karte hai, lekin afsos ki hamen vaisaa kuch bhi mahasoos nahin hota
 Actually, the tickle is a matter of surprise and a human cannot be a surprise
 hamaara dimag is baat ko pehle hi jaan jaataa he ki ham khud ko gudgudane ja rahe hai
 What actions will we do, etc
 agar aap iske baavjood khud ko gudgudane kii koshish karenge to gudagudi ke bajaay kuch or hi hoga
 However, with a feather in your own hands, you can tickle yourself by turning it on the skin
 magar aisa mushkil se hi hota he ki aap hansate-hansate lotpot ho jaaen

 Premium charges apply!! The story of what happened in Tihar jail on Tuesday evening had already been written
 nitu bavodiya or niraj bavana gang ke bich yah dushmani lagbhag das saal puraani he
 Neetu used to speak of Dabodia in outer Delhi
 nitu kii takat badhati ja rahi thi
 He also spread his foot in Haryana and Punjab
 jabaran vasuuli or theke par hatyakarna nitu gang kaa shagal ban gaya tha
 If the matter escalated, a reward of seven lakhs was announced on it
 is dauraan bahridilli main niraj bavana gang tejise ubharne laga
 Neeraj also started recovering
 yah baat nitu ke gale nahin utari
 There was enmity between the two on this matter only
 jab bhi mauka miltaa ye donon gang ek-duusare ke logon kii jaan lene lage
 a few days ago, there was a public firing in the Subhash Place area between the miscreants on both sides
 ek duusare se aage nikalne kii hode main kai baadmaash maare bhi gaye
 The special cell had killed Neetu in an encounter near the Grand Hotel in Vasant Kunj on the night of 24 October 2013, almost two years ago
 nitu par dilli, haryana or punjab main hatya, vasuuli, lutpaat, hatya kaa prayaas or car chori jaise kareeb 50 maamle darj the
 After the murder of Havildar Ramkishan of Delhi Police, the Special Cell had included him in the list of most wanted criminals
 lekin nitu ke maare jane ke baad bhi giroh kaa dabadabaa kam nahin ho rahaa tha
 The rogue Paras of Panipat took command of the gang
 or ab wo jail ke andar se hi giroh kaa sanchaalan kar rahaa tha
 This thing was continuously knocking Neeraj
 police or jail prashasan is gangvaar se acchhee tarah waakif tha
 Yet on Tuesday, the jail administration and the police gave Neeraj an opportunity that he had been looking for for many years
 kaidiyon ko le jane vaali vine main kul 9 log savaar the
 In which seven were from Neeraj Gang while two were from Neetu Gang
 jisamen nitu gang kaa sargana paras bhi shaamil tha
 Neeraj had conspired to eliminate Paras and his accomplice Pradeep while going from prison to court
 niraj ne us vakt apni sajeesh ko anjaam de daalaa jab ve court se waapas jail laut rahe the
 While returning, Paras alias Goldie and Pradeep were brutally murdered
 yahaan tak ki hamalaavaron ne donon kii ankhe tak andar ghusaa di
 Now the question arises that when the police and the jail administration knew about the enmity between Neeraj and Neetu Gang
 to unhone unhen ek saath vine main kyon court bheja
 The police and the jail administration are being viewed with suspicion
 iske peeche ek badi sajeesh kii bu aa rahi he

 apni bejod adaa ke chalate pachaas or saath ke dashak main bade parde par raaj karne vaale jane maane or varisht abhinayta shammi kapur kaa ravivaar ko mahanagar ke brich candi aspataal main nidhan ho gaya
 He was 79
 unke parivaar main patni nila devi, putr aditya raaj or putree kanchan desai hai
 According to family sources, Shammi was on dialysis for the last few years
 unhen saptaah main kam se kam teen baar dialysis karana padataa tha
 He was admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit yesterday
 varsh 1953 main bollywood main dastak dene vaale shammi kii pehali film ‘jivan jyoti’ thi
 In the year 1961, the super hit film 'junglee' gave him a special place in the world of big screen
 shammi ne filmon main apni khaas adaayagi se alahada tarah kii chhavi banaayi
 Kapur, known as 'elvis Presley of India', made his acting debut on the silver screen when his elder brothers Raj Kapoor as well as Dev Anand and Dilip Kumar were playing
 parivaar ke sutron ke anusaar, shammi ke gurdon ne kaam karnaa band kar diya tha
 His funeral will take place on Monday morning
 shammi kaa vaastavik naam shamsher raaj kapur tha
 Born on 21 October 1931, Shammi was the second son of theater actor and film actor Prithviraj Kapoor
 apni paariwarik prishthbhumi ke baavjood shammi kaa film jagat main pravesh ‘rail kaa dibba’ main madhubala, ‘shamaa paravaanaa’ main suraiya or ‘ham sab chor hai’ main nalini jayavant ke saath abhinay karne ke baavjood shuruyaat main safal nahin rahaa
 'shammi Kapoor style' will always be alive in the minds of fans
 The veteran actor Shammi Kapoor, who won the hearts of actresses with his distinctive dances and romantic performances in many Bollywood films, has left behind such a "style" that his fans will always remember
 prithviraj kapur ke bete or ‘shoman’ raaj kapur ke bhai hone ke naate shammi ke saamne apni alag pahchaan banane kii chunauti thi kyonki adaakaari main kadam rakhte hi un par ummiido kaa boj pad gaya tha
 Shammi knew that his brother was already a superstar and a famous filmmaker, so he would definitely be compared to his brother
 unhen pataa tha ki agar vah khud ko sabit karnaa chaahate hai to unhen apane bhai se kuch alag karke dikhaanaa hoga
 Shammi's first film, which made its Bollywood debut in 1953, however, only showed him the shadow of his brother Raj Kapoor
 ‘rail kaa dibba’, ‘chor bazaar’, ‘shamaa paravaanaa’, ‘ham sab chor hai’, ‘memsahab’ or ‘miss coca cola’ jaisi filmon main shammi ko bilkul nae avatar main dikhaaya gaya, khaskar unki baalo, muunchon or parde par adaaon kii style ekadam alag thi
 Shammi tasted success for the first time in 1957 through Nasir Hussain's film Tumsa Nahi Dekha
 yah abhinayta tatkaaleen diggaj holliwood kalakaaron elvis prestle or james dean kii tarah nai veshbhusha main dikhaai diye
 After this, Shammi did not look back and went up the stairs of success
 shammi apane doston se aksar is baat par charchaa kiya karte the ki vah film main apane sarvshereshth abhinay ke liye kya kya nai koshishen kar sakate hai
 After the immense success of 'tumsa Nahi Dekha', the pair of Nasir and Shammi acted in many other successful films
 shammi ne lokapriy hone se pehle hi prasiddh abhinetri gita bali se shaadi rachaa lee thi or shaadi kaa unki lokapriyata par bilkul asar nahin padaa
 Unfortunately Geeta died soon after due to illness
 varsh 1959 main nasir 
 Shammi's hit duo gave another superhit film as 'dil Deke Dekho' and Asha Parekh also gained popularity through this film
 varsh 1961 main shammi kii ek aisi film ai jisane lokapriyata ke sabhi paimaane tod diye
 Shammi's performance in the film 'junglee' directed by Subodh Mukherjee was highly appreciated
 ‘junglee’ ne shammi kii ‘yahuu’ chhavi ko banaaya or yah film pehali rangeen romantic film thi
 The film proved to be a milestone in the Indian film industry
 shammi kii dilkash shakhsiyat ne ‘china toun’ ‘dil tera divaana’ or ‘professor’ jaisi filmon kii safalataa main ahm yogadan diya
 Most of Shami's films, which created a fan following in the audience, were made keeping in mind the youth
 aashaa paarekh, syra bano or sharmila tagore jaisi kai abhinetriyon ne shammi kii filmon main hi padaarpan kiya or baad main safalataa kaa bulandiyon ko chuaa
 nasir-shammi duo rocked the box office with 'thirty Manzil' and the film was one of the most successful films of Shammi's career

 The central line's signal system was damaged due to the fire, but the technical fault has not yet been corrected
 yani aaj bhi dinabhar central line par kal kii tarah maaraa maari machi rahegi
 Even today there is no good news for those traveling from Mumbai Local

 And till the technical flaws go away, the problem of the people of Mumbai is certain

 vigyaan bhawan main 17 se 19 sitambar tak yojitarastriya swayamsevak sangh(aresas) ke kaarykram main congress adhyaksharahul gandhiko nyote dene kii khabaron ne khub surkhiyaan batorin
 At the same time, reports of the rss's outspoken Congress leaders Digvijay Singh and Jayaram Ramesh were also invited
 aresas ke sutron ke hawaale se pichley ek pakhwaade se aisi khabaren media kii khub surkhiyaan baniin
 Initially, the Congress reacted cautiously when the news of the invitation came
 party ne kaha ki jab nyotaa aayega, tab ham us par koi pratikriya denge
 After all, the party felt that the RSS had sent an invitation to him to be the president of Sonia Gandhi
 isliye shaayad is baar bhi bheje
 However, Sonia then declined the invitation, calling the union disruptive
 lekin aakhirkaar 14 sitambar ko kaarykram se do din pehle jab phir nyote kii khabar ai to media se mukhaatib hone se pehle congress ke media prabharee randeep singh surajevaala ne rahul gandhi ke daftar main sampark kiya
 After thorough investigation, Rahul Gandhi's office said that no invitation has come to the Congress President
 iske baad surajevaala ne media se kaha ki pichley kuch dinon se nimantran kii ek juthi afvaah failaai ja rahi he, jabaki aisa koi nyotaa aayaa hi nahin he
 Also Surjewala added that the RSS invitation is not a gold medal
 aresas kii soch vighatnkaaree he, ye sabhi jaanate hai
 Actually, through this statement Surjewala shot two targets with one stone
 ek to nyote nahin aane kii baat rakhi, aresas par hamalaa bhi bol diya or nyotaa aae bhi to rahul gandhi ke nahin jane kaa ishaara bhi kar diya
 By the way, it is not only interesting to invite Rahul Gandhi, but when 'aaj Tak' asked party leader Digvijay Singh about the invitation, he bluntly said that he has not received any invitation
 saath hi digvijay singh ne kaha ki jhooth kii factory se niklaa ye ek or jhooth he
 Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh has also denied receiving any invitation from the RSS

 After killing 50 people from mob lynchings of guards and 30 people from rumors of child theft, the Supreme Court has now given a 45-page verdict in the two-year-old case, calling for preventive, corrective and punitive steps

 ? Supreme Court Guidelines, New Wine in Old Bottle: The Supreme Court has issued a guideline, stating that in the event of mob lynching, FIR immediately, investigation and charge sheet, trial in six months trial, maximum punishment for criminals, States should take steps like protection of witnesses, action against negligent policemen, speedy compensation to victims
 in sabhi vishyon par supreme court ne pehle bhi anek faisle die hai,jinhen lagu nahin karne se mob linching ke aparaadhiyon kaa hausala badhata he
 With the new guidelines, the victims will hardly get relief, yes, the paper-sheets and meetings of the officials will increase
 masuka jaise kanoonon kaa durupyog kaise rukegaa :mob linching jaisi ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye rashtriya suraksha kanoon (rasuka) kii tarj par maanav suraksha kanoon (masuka) yadi laayaa gaya,to isse anek nuksaan ho sakate hai
 Due to political patronage, the cases registered against the stonemasons in Kashmir valley and the miscreants of Jat agitation in Haryana are returned
 duusari ore mob linching jaise maamalon main yadi masuka kanoon lagu kiya gaya,to iske durupyog se nirdosh logon ko fansaane kii gunjaaish bad jaaegi
 Parliament to postpone case in the name of new law: Supreme Court has said that a new law should be enacted by Parliament to make mob lynching a separate offense

 The If strict criminal action is taken against the leaders protecting such hate crimes by disqualifying them from election, then the mob lynching shop of the liberated leaders will be closed automatically
 rajyon kii bajaay netaaon ke viruddh avmaananaa kii karrwai kyon nahin :mahatma gandhi ke pautra tushaar gandhi kii yachika par supreme court ne6sitambar, 2017ko rajyon ko mob linching rokane kaa aadesh diya tha
 Due to non-compliance of Supreme Court order by states like Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, a contempt notice has been issued against them, which will be heard next month
 netaaon ke sangrakshan main mob linching ek sangathit udyog ban gaya he,jiske khilaaf thos karrwai karne kii bajaay,rajyon ke khilaaf avmaananaa notice se kya hasil hoga
 
 
 Why not appoint a complaint officer in India for whatsapp: According to the intermediary rules under the IT Act, the appointment of a complaint officer in the country by Internet and social media companies is necessary

 is meeting main dushmano ko kaise jawaab de sakate hai uski ranneeti banaai jaati he
 The Central Government's Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) of the Government of India discusses and debates about the security of the country
 jiske baad rashtriya suraksha upkaran, raksha niti or suraksha main kharch ko lekar antim nirnay liye jate hai
 Let us tell you, the CCS meeting is chaired by the Prime Minister of India
 dilli main ek gaanv he lado sarai
 This village has now become a city
 kachi galiyon ko cement se dhaal diya gaya he or neeche naale kaa pani jam hota he to gharon main ris kar aane lagata he
 On reaching Lado Sarai, the tragedy of our system starts to appear
 chand roj pehle yahaan dengue ke kaaran ek saat saal ke bachche avinaash kii maut ho gai thi
 According to reports, Avinash's father Lakshmichandra and mother Babita took him to several hospitals but were refused from many places
 deree hone ke kaaran avinaash ko nahin bachaaya ja sakaa
 In this shock Babita and Laxmichandra jumped from the building and gave their lives
 is khabar ko padhate hue main khud ko saamaanya nahin rakh paaya
 As much as you think this may have been an exception, but equally the parents were dancing in front of their helpless eyes
 main jab lado sarai pahunchaa to teen-teen maut ke baad galiyon main samaaj or system kii traasadee najar aa rahi thi, jisane aakrosh se bhar diya
 Looks like Lado Sarai has never been neglected
 
 
 pravesh dwaar par hi bane kooda ghar ke baahar chooney kii line bana di gai thi
 Which makes the media feel that there is cleanliness here
 kaash aisa hi puri dilli yaa kisi bhi shahar ke saath hota
 This gimmick of the system after three deaths was disturbing
 gaanv ke bheetar kii deevaaron par dengue se bachane ke upayon vaale poster laga die gaye the
 People told that as soon as the corpse moved from here, the MCD people came and put up posters
 pehle nahin lagaaya tha
 i noticed a similar poster
 janvari se lekar sitambar tak kii taarikh likhi hui thi
 Anyone can see that all the dates are written with the same pencil, same handwriting and same day
 janvari kii likhaawat sitambar kii likhaawat kii tarah kyon nai dikhegi
 Something should have made a difference in color
 system kaa harakat main aana acha he lekin is tarah safai abhiyaan kii tarikhon ko likh kar janaa kisi bhi myne main nirlajjataa se kam nahin he
 People told that fogging did not happen earlier, but now fogging has also taken place
 gaanv se baahar aane par logon ne dikhaaya ki sadak ke kinare shauchalay banane laga he
 The workers were working fast
 gaanv waalon ne kaha ki yah media ke dar se shauchalay ban rahaa he
 To show people
 iske pehle gaanv ke aas paas kahin bhi saarvajanik shauchalay nahin he
 We have to defecate in the open
 lado sarai ke paas ek acha sa park he
 This park meant for children will be called very good in terms of the existing system
 is park main baio shauchalay bana hua tha
 Went to see him
 shauchalay kii haalat badtar ho chuki thi, koi rakrakhaav nahin
 There mosquitoes established their rule
 tippaniyan The villagers then showed that rooms were built on the roadside during the Commonwealth Games
 unki jaankaree main yah baat thi ki isamen bill vagairah jamaa karne ke counter khulenge lekin vah abhi tak band padaa he
 Garbage has accumulated all around
 paas main ek or aisa cameraa bana hua he
 His door was open from behind
 acchhee lite lagi thi
 For this, the government must have wasted millions of rupees and it is lying on the pavement without any work
 yah he hamaare mulk kii tasviir
 What is it is that the system below does not change with all the political changes
 jo jahaan he vah apana nunatam kaam nahin karata he
 If the system were to work, both of these rooms built on the road would not be useless
 sardi ke dinon main hi garibon ke liye rain basere ke kaam kar sakate the
 All these pictures are frustrating
 ise em si di banaam dilli sarkaar, dilli sarkaar banaam centre sarkaar karte-karte ham thak jaaenge
 Even if everything is solved, this reality is not going to change
 kya yah sharmnaak nahin he ki jis jagah par teen logon kii maut hui ho us jagah par apni chhavi bachaane ke liye em si di lipapoti kar rahi he
 Looks like Lado Sarai has never been neglected

 — shahid kapoor (@shahidkapoor)august 10, 2014 Today a friend sparked a discussion, so i remembered the singer of Hindi cinema
 assi ke dashak main in donon kaa pradurbhaav hua tha
 The feeling was very good but sadly kept connecting
 ek the mohammad ajij, duusare shabbir kumaar
 Both were seekers of music
 ek taan main sen, duusare aalaap main pralapi
 These voices are foreshadowed by listening to the songs of the last years of the great Rafi's life
 phir ek din achaanak jab ve radio kii band deevaaron ko cheer kar hamaare kaan main ghuspaith kar baithi tab hamane anubhav kiya ki nakal kala bahut kuch chhin bhinn kar sakati he
 Since every singer sings poorly at some point in his life, Rafi also sings some songs poorly, his devotees may disagree, but someday he will explain to them that Rafi, Kishore, Mahan Lata, and Mukesh , Manna Dey has sung some songs poorly
 baharhaal in donon saahabon ne rafee ke sabase kharaab gaanon se apni gayaki ke liye sabase acchhee prerana lee or aa gaye hormonium kii neend haraam karne
 While listening to them, it seems as if (I wish i could get that specific voice out of these words) Mohammad Rafi's soul has been strangled with a stick
 ek baar kisi garib channel par ajij sahab kaa saakshaatkaar chal rahaa tha, vaachak se baat karte hue unhone garv se kaha ki darasal bachapan se hi rafee sahab feet ho gaye the andar
 That's when i understood, now i am not free
 
 
 gane main ek baarik sa bhatkaav bada fark paidaa karata he
 Here both of them unfortunately took the sound they heard from songs sung in the last years of Rafi Sahab's life
 vahaan se jab gaanaa shuru hua to sunne waalon kii aatma kaanp uthi
 The voice, which gives the illusion of being dull and serious, creates a jubilant spirit in Rafi's spirit
 lagata tha masaan main koi gane kii tantra sadhana kar rahaa ho or us daur ke liriks kii to puuchhie hi mat
 This was a Deadly cocktail that would probably never be ahead
 agar ho jaae, to hindi cinema kaa saubhaahgya
 In some of the classics sung by him, Aajkali is not remembered
 
 Since singing, nowadays, the sound of something else used to become above, that's why it is written
 jaisaa ki, ek basii aapaki yaad yane ke baad
 
 doosraa namoona, hairaan hum main aapaki julifon ko dekhakar, aa ha ha dabar aanwala kesh tel
 
 na fankaar tujhisa tere baad yaaya
 
 mohammad rafee tu bahut yaad yaaya
 
 ek to rafee ke upar gaanaa, doosraa amitabh par filmana
 Silky voice like Rafi on the one hand, unprecedented dialogue delivery like Amitabh on the other
 in donon hi vibhootiyon ke saath mohammad ajij ne aitihaasik anyaay kiya, lekin gunahagaar wo nahin us film ke produsar the, jinke kudh dimag ne aise kisi gane kii kalpana kii thi, or filmaaya tha
 Like, 'aakhri Rasta' is a song from the film, 'tune mein milk piya hai, you are exactly like me, oops! The milk came down in the mother's chest
 or gayakon main vir, shabbir kumaar ne jab amitabh ke liye gaaya to unhen hindi cinema kaa shreshth mard bana daalaa
 Marid Tanga 
 Yaad hai? There is another song from the same film, o Maa Sherawali
 hindi cinema ke yugon-yugon se bhatke maa-bete ke milan kaa kaarunik aakhyaan
 Uff don't ask, even when he sings the song, all the valleys of my heart tremble in the pangs of anguish
 kya gayak the donon, ji karata he unke hi gaanon par likhata rahun
 For almost a decade and a half, these two singing singers have given some of the best songs
 hukumat, dharmendra kii mahaan film kaa ek gaanaa jab shabbir kumaar kii aawaaj main bajataa he, to marpet kii ichha jaag uthati he, kyonki uske bol hai 'are maaro usko maaro
 
 ' aawaaj main aisi kaarigari!in donon hi gayakon par lambey shodh kii jarurat he, gayaki kii koun si pravriti se prerana lekar inhone rafee ko rond daalaa tha? is daur ke sabhi gane jo rishi kapur, mithun, amitabh or upar se neeche tak safed bhutiya vastra dhaaran kar nrity karne vaale jitendra ke liye in donon ne gaae wo anmol the, shrota samay se bhatki hui us suramala ko apana saubhaahgya maanate hai
 a short list of some of his memorable songs is in front of you
 tuune baichaiyn itnaa jiyaada kiya,maai nem is lakhan,kaagaj kalam dawaat laa,duniya main kitna gam he,main teri muhabbat main pagal ho jaaoongitefaq dekhie ki in donon hi pratapi gayakon ko zyaadaatar vilaapi gaan mili
 And both produced vocals like Kukkur Rudan
 unke aise gaanon kii suchi bahut lambii he
 Which can be proud
 unke kai gaanon ko sunate hue aisa lagata he jaise rafee kaa koi dakait divaana, gale main katta daal kar baith gaya ho or kah rahaa ho gaao betaa
 Such singers are not born again and again
 cinema kaa ek sunaharaa daur inhen paidaa karata he
 While going, you will hear a song by Shabbir Kumar, 'gori hai kalaiyan'
 
 This Bhima of singing was born during the most tumultuous time of Amitabh Bachchan's stardom, who defeated everyone with a mace of throat
 in donon hi asurasainiyon ko meraa naman
 The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday confirmed that Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was dismissed as the third umpire showed an incorrect replay during the first day of the second Test between India and the West Indies

 Union Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thawarchand Gehlot has written to HRD Minister Smriti Irani and welcomed the abolition of the minority status given to them
 gahalot ne kaha ki in sansthaanon main alpsankhyak darje ke naam par dalit, adivasee or anya pichde varg ke chaatro ko milane vaala aarakshan nakaar diya jaataa tha or ab aisa nahin hoga
 In his letter to Irani on 18 January, Gehlot said that this step of the Ministry of Human Resource Development is commendable, because it will help in building an inclusive society and implemented 'sabka Saath Sabka Vikas' in true sense as per Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision
 Will be able to go gahalot ne enditivi se kaha ki unke mantralay ko lagaataar in donon vishvavidhyalayon ke bare main prativedan miltaa rahaa he, jinamein alpsankhyak states kii aad main dalit-adivasee or obisi chaatro ko samvidhan pradutt aarakshan or anya suvidhaon ko nakaarne kii baat kahi jaati rahi

 Gehlot said that the reservation given to Dalit, Adivasi and other backward class students in the name of minority status in these institutions was denied and will not happen now
 gahalot ne irani ko 18 janvari ko likhe apane patr main kaha he ki maanav sansaadhaan vikaas mantralay kaa ye kadam saraahneey he, kyonki isse samaveshi samaaj ke nirmaan main sahyog milegaa or pradhanmantri narendra modi kii manshaanusaar 'sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas' sahi arthon main lagu kiya ja sakegaa
 Gehlot told NDTV that his ministry has been continuously receiving reports about these two universities, in which under the garb of minority status, dalit-adivasi and OBC students were said to be denying constitution-provided reservation and other facilities
 gahalot ke mutabik ab jabaki maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne spasht kiya he ki jamiya milia vishvavidhyalay or aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay kaa alpsankhyak darja na hokar ye kendriya vishvavidhyalay hai, in chaatro ko unka adhikaar dilaane main aasaani hogi

 Saturday is very special for the devotees of Bhole, this day has become more important for the natives suffering from Saturn and it is because of that coincidence which happens once in many years
 lekin jab kabhi banataa he bhakton kii dubi kismat ko chamakaa detaa he, bigadi bana detaa he
 The 27th date is the Trayodashi Tithi of Ashwin Shuklapaksha which is the favorite date of Lord Shiva and on this day Saturn is also becoming a combination of Sun

 The combination of Sun and Saturn is also important because this combination is being made in the Libra zodiac, which is the amount associated with justice, which means that you will get rid of false accusations, lawsuits and have the power to fight against injustice
 jivan main ek nayi urja kaa sanchaar hoga
 Astrologers believe that this auspicious position of planets is being made after 1982 i
e
 after 30 years
 shanivaar ko uttara bhadrapada nakshatra bhi he jo shani kaa nakshatra he jo bhakton ko kii gayi puja kaa purna fal dilaane main madad karegaa vahiin shani pradosh vrath main surya shani kii yuti asuri shaktiyon se nijaat dilaane main madadgaar sabit hogi
 Overall, Saturday day can prove to be very important in your life, can fill your life with happiness, if on Saturday you have pleased Lord Shiva with Shani, then many months to come will be cut without any disturbance and life The path will be easy forever
