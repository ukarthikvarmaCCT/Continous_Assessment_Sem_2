 1
 Girls don't like confuse boys at all
 aise main aap jab bhi ladki ko milane ke liye bulaaen jagah fiks kar len
 The place should be such that two people can sit and talk comfortably
 bahut shorgul vaali jagah aapaki date barbaad kar sakati he
 It would not be right to choose a place where only two of you are there
 ho saktaa he ladki ko ye pasand na aae or wo asahaj mahasoos kare
 2
 date ke dauraan bahut adhik excited hona yaa phir nervas ho janaa donon hi galat he
 Stay the way you are
 aap normal hokar baat karenge, tabhisamne vaala shaks bhi normal ho paaegaa
 3
 first impressant bahut myne rakhata he

 aaie jaanate hai confident ladakiyon ke baaren main ye 7 baaten
 
 
 1
 aap kisi ke saath ke liye nirbhar nahinshopping,dinar ho yaa movie dekhnaa, kahin bhi jane ke liye aapako kisi kii jarurat nahin hoti
 That is, your plans do not depend on having no one because you do not spend time, you like to live life
 2
 You know your value
 You never give rights to others that someone should judge you
 aapako apni takat or kamajoriyon, donon kaa pataa he
 You are constantly trying to improve them
 3
 You do not like to give cleanliness
 You are not interested in expanding everything because you like to give sterilization and do not take
 4
 You don't run after attentions
 You are so confident in your ability that you don't need someone else's certificate for this
 aapako koi aapke bare main acha feel karaae, iske liye aap kisi par nirbhar nahin rahati
 5
 apane faisle khud hi lenaa pasand hyaap jindagi kaa koi bhi faisla kisidusre ke preshramein aakar lenaa nahin chaahatin
 Even if you listen to everyone's talk, but they are of their own mind
 6
 Do not carry any negative things, where do you want to spend your time, or where not
 kis insaan ko atension deni he kisko nahin
 You take all these decisions yourself and do not let anyone fill your life negativity
 7
 You want to take care of yourself
 People who care about you also like you
 lekin har vakt koi aapaki parvaah karata rahe ye aapako pasand nahin aata

 (samachar agency pitiai ke input ke saath) China is standing behind Pakistan and if it is the most difficult reason for India, then it is the biggest force for Pakistan, because the way Pakistan rejected the decision of the International Court of Justice without delay, it raised a new question
 Has given whether Pakistan wants to go to the UN, disregarding isj's decision
 yuan main china ke vito kaa saath pakistan ko mil jayega, jaise jaish ke mukhiya masood ajahar par vito par china ne bachaaya
 It is obvious that Pakistan is the most important strategic partner for China at the moment and India is a challenge for China and note that in the role that China is playing with Pakistan, from terrorism to economic corridor in Kashmir, China will stand with Pakistan in Jadhav case, it cannot be denied
 lekin jadhav maamle main pakistan kaa saath dena china ko bhi katghare main khadaa saktaa he, kyonki maujuuda vakt meninternational court of justisake 15 jajon kii qatari main china ke bhi jaj jiyoo hanqueen bhi hai or faisla sunaate hue do baar roni abraham ne sarvasammati se die ja rahe faisle kaa zikr kiya
 On one hand, if the Chinese judge is with the decision, then the matter may go to the UN
 vahaan china kaise pakistan ke liye vito kar saktaa he
 But this is possible only when China also considers the decision of the ISJ on the Jadhav case as only a legal decision
 haalanki sach ulta he
 The decision of the court is not limited to law only in view of the relations between India and Pakistan and it is not a legal understanding for China to stand with Pakistan or go against India, but ahead of diplomatic and politics, the way the New World Order is in China The question for India is wanting to do in it, not Pakistan but China, so that the key of the locks of Pakistan will not open without colliding, this is also true

 Sacred Games 2 has been the target of many people due to its slow pace and controversial plot, while many people have also praised its daring and very relevant content according to the current era
 is dhuvrikaran ke bich secred games sijan 1 or sijan 2 main ek antar dekhne ko mila he or wo he duusare sijan main antarang drishyon kii kami
 In Sacred Games season 1, where there were many bold scenes, in season 2, these scenes were used only symbolically
 sijan 1 main hinsa, sex or gaaliyon kaa mishran tha or kahin naa kahin ye sijan apni kahani ke saath hi saath in drishyon ke liye bhi kaaphi surkhiyaan batorne main kaamyaab rahaa tha
 Season 1 of Sacred Games featured these intimate relationships in a more natural way than was often seen in Hollywood films, and at the same time the show broke stereotypes on several levels
 aise main is sho ke kuch phens ko ummid thi ki duusare sijan main bhi aisa hi kuch dekhne ko milegaa lekin is baar aisa nahin hua
 View this post on instagrama post shared by Sacred Games (@sacredgames_tv) onaug 15, 2019 at 1:32 am PDT Significantly, in the recent past, the government has become strict about the content of Netflix
 isi saal may ke maheene main supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko notice jari kiya tha ki netflix or amejon prime jaise plateforms par content ko regulate kiya jaae kyonki in plateforms par kaaphi valgar content hota he
 Apart from this, platforms like Netflix and Amazon had spoken of self-censorship in January in view of the pressure of the government
 mana ja rahaa he ki sensorship or sarkaar ke isi pachade se bachane ke liye anuraag kashyap or vikramaditya motwani ne secred games sijan 2 ke liye in seens se tauba kii he
 The special thing is that the makers of the show have repeatedly said that they did not expect the show to be a superhit of the first season, so it may be that the first season too, to bring the show to the limelight somewhere i have resorted to these intimate scenes, but since the show was gaining popularity by the second season, the makers of the show had given these scenes only in a symbolic and poetic way in the series

 Samajwadi Party (SP) President Mulayam Singh Yadav on Wednesday demanded the Central Government to bring back the Indian occupied part of China and Pakistan and appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to let Parliament know about the talks with the Pakistani Prime Minister
 
 mulaayam ne raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par dhanyavad prastaav ke dauraan kaha ki main sarkaar se kahana chahta hum ki agar aap china or pakistan ke kabje main maujuud bhartiya hisse ko waapas laate hai to ham aapako samarthan denge

 Mulayam accused the elected members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of being arrogant and said that we have seen the mandate of 1971 and 1984
 mat bhuuliye ki 1977 or 1989 main kya hua tha
 The Indira Gandhi-led Congress had won 353 seats in 1971 and after the Emergency, the figure was reduced to 189 in 1977, Indira also lost the Rae Bareli seat

 But there is a smell of arrogance in what has been said by the ruling party since yesterday
 unhone kaha ki dhanyavad prastaav rakhte hue rajeev pratap rudi ne jo baaten kahi, vah apekshit nahin thi
 Whereas Ramvilas Paswan suddenly changed his perception about the things he said about BJP till some time back
 anwar ne kaha ki bijepi ne janata se 60 maheene maange the
 He got 60 months

 anant vijay hamaare daur ke bade likkhaad hai
 He has left a wide impact as a columnist, critic, writer, speaker
 khub padhate hai, or utana hi likhte bhi hai
 As a writer, he is very clear about his subject, while as a critic, he has thrown a lot of great writers
 haal ke dinon main vah apane dakshinpanthi lagaav ko lekar bhi kaaphi charchaa main rahe, haalanki vah ise na to sweekaarte hai, na hi nakaarte
 His thinking on many topics is very clear
 sambhawatah isaki vajah unka vah padhaakupan he, jisaki tarif kabhi rajendra yadav va namvar singh tak ne kii thi
 Whether Anant Vijay accepts it or not, he has as much love for Gandhi as with the Sangh and its ideology
 vah kehete bhi hai, gandhi ji kii nitiyon ko sangh ne jitna apanaaya va amal kiya, utana congress ne nahin
 He was also subjected to criticism many times over the same clarity of thoughts
 ek baar unhone rajasthan main yah kah diya tha ki hamaare samaaj main vyakti puja kii had yahaan tak he ki ham haare hue nayakon kaa bhi gauravgaan karne main koi kor kasar nahin chhodte
 Sculptures, build bridges in his name
 tab mana yah gaya ki unka ishaara maharana pratap kii taraf he
 There was a lot of criticism but he did not back down
 likhnaa- or apane likhe par adig rahanaa, bolnaa- or apane vaktavy main kisi ko na bakhshane kii apni pravriti ke chalate hi vah sahitya mahotsavon kaa charchit cheharaa hai
 However, the speed with which Anant made friends, the faster the opponent
 par in sabake bich jo ek cheez nirvivaad rup se unke saath kaayam rahi, vah he sahitya se unka judaav or uski pronnati ko lekar unki pahal
 He writes regular columns in the newspaper he is associated with, and is involved in a variety of schemes to bring literature into the mainstream
 'prasangvash', 'kolahal kalah main', 'vidhaon kaa vinyas', 'bollywood selfi' or 'loktantr kii kasuti' jaisi pustakon ke lekhak; 'mere paatr', 'kahani', 'kolahal main kavita', '21veen sadi kii 21 kahaniyaan'; ke sampadak or 'bivi fatima or badshaah ke bete' ke anuvadak anant kii vaani prakaashan se ‘marxvad kaa ardhsaty' naam se nai aalochanatmak kitaab ai he
 As an introduction to this book, the flap reads, "the title of Anant Vijay's book 'ardh Satya Satya of Marxism' will at once surprise the reader
" kshambhar ke liye use thithak kar yah sochane par vivash karegaa ki kahin yah pustak marxvaadi aalochana athwa marxvaadi siddhanton kii koi vivechna yaa uski koi punarvyakhya sthapit karne kaa prayaas to nahin he
 But as the reader enters the book, its confusion will disappear
 ant tak aate-aate yah bhram us vishwaas main tabdeel ho jaayegaa ki marxvad kii aad main in dinon kaise aapasi hit va swaarth ke takaraahaton ke chalate vyakti vichaaron se upar ho jaataa he
 How the behavior of a Marxist changes due to individualistic contradictions and misconduct
 "pichley lagbhag ek dashak main marxvad se hindi pattee kaa mohabhang hua he or nijee takaraahaton ke chalate marxvaadi benakaab hue hai, anant vijay ne sookshmata se un karkon kaa vishleshan kiya he, jisane marxvaadiyon ko aise chauraahey par laakar khadaa kar diya he, jahaan yah tay kar paanaa mushkil ho gaya he ki vichaardhaara badi he yaa vyakti
 On the pretext of individualism, the infinite victory has tried to remove and understand the gorge that has frozen over Marxism
 ‘marxvad kaa ardhsaty' darasal vyaktivaadee kuntha or vaicharik dambh ko saamne laata he, jo patibaddhta kii aad main saamanti, jativaadee or burjua maansikta ko majboot karata he
 Today, this book brings out the same ruthless truth in the manner in which Marxism has been forced by its followers to splash into ideological cloak
 ek tarah se kaha jaye to yah pustak isi ardhsaty kaa marsia he
 Book excerpt: The semi-truth of Marxism * The mask of the revolutionary hero has also been descending continuously from the face of Anant Vijayfidel Castro, which was not discussed
 fidel castro ne shaadishuda hote hue ek shaadishuda mahila se naa keval sambandh banaae balki unke ek bachche ke pita bhi bane
 The extramarital affair was revealed after the love letters between this woman named Natalia and Castro became public
 jab natalia kii maut hui to unhen is baat kaa malaal tha ki jis shaks ne 1953 main akraman kii ranneeti unke ghar par rahakar banaai vahi shaks jab do saal baad cuba kii satta par kabiz hote he to usko bhul jaataa he
 Forgetting, he also goes to his daughter
 yah marxvad kii ek gilaas pani kii avadharana kaa nikrushtatam rup he
 Now even a dangerous thing has emerged from him
 satraa saal tak cuba ke raashtrapati fidel castro ke angrakshak rahe juaan renaldo sanches kii kitaab- da dabl life of fidel castro-se yah khulaasa kiya he ki kis tarah se castro ne ek drugs kaarobaari ko pachhattar hajaar dollar ke evaj main cuba main aish karne kii anumati di
 This book provides ample evidence of how Fidel Castro was sitting in his secret room and bargaining about the cocaine trader
 is kitaab ke lekhak ne is baat kaa bhi khulaasa kiya ki castro ke hawana main bees aaleeshaan kothiyaan hai, wo ek carabian dweep ke bhi maalik hai
 It is clear from such revelations that under the guise of Marxism, their leaders adopt all kinds of materialistic tendencies ranging from mystical sexual life and straighten their owl by dreaming of changing the system under the guise of ideology
 germany kii communist party ke bare main lenin ne kaha tha ki vahaan ke leftist khud ko vampanthi nahin maanate hai or apane aap ko saidhantik aadhaar par pratipaksh qaraar dete hai
 Lenin had at that time called that tendency of the leftists of Germany as Infantile Disorder of Leftism
 abhivyakti kii aazaadee par khatra bataate hue jis tarah se kareeb do darjan lekhakon ne sahitya academy kaa puraskaar lautaaya tha usko dekhakar lenin ke shabd udhaar lekar kaha ja saktaa he ki puraskaar vaapasi ke ye lekhak bhi inphantile disorder ke shikaar the
 Here too, almost all authors have declared themselves to be opposing principles
 ab agar ham pratipaksh ke saidhantik paksh ko parakhte hai to yah saaf taur par ubharta he ki wo desh, kaal or paristhiti ke hisaab se apana paksh badalte rahe hai
 Today, most of those who are facing threat to freedom of expression were writing during the Emergency
 yah baat bahes se pare he ki bharat main agar abhivyakti kaa sabase bada khatra utpann hua tha to wo immergency kaa daur tha
 At that time, our fundamental rights were also guarded
 ab jaraa us daur main leftiston ko yaad kariye ki unka rukh kya tha
 The Emergency Writers' Association, chaired by novelist Bhishma Sahni in Delhi, supported the Emergency and termed it a discipline festival
 us vakt kisi bhi lekhak kii antaratma kii aawaaj nahin jaagi thi or kisi ne puraskaar vaapasi kaa kadam nahin uthaaya tha
 Because at that time these institutions were under the control of the Left
 yah vahi daur tha jab indira gandhi ne immergency ke samarthan ke evaj main vamapanthiyon ko saahitiyik sansthaaon kii jagiradaari saunp di thi
 Now, even if we do not raise the issue after the anti-sikh riots of Chaurasi, we should not ask any question regarding the return of the writers award during the 2002 Gujarat riots, but the Muzaffarnagar riots should be raised
 dadri ke paas ikhlaaq kii hatya ko bhi puraskaar waapas karanevaalon ne mudda banaaya he
 Sixty-two people were killed in the riots in Muzaffarnagar, a few kilometers from Dadri
 uske baad akhilesh sarkaar ne apane salanaa sahityak puraskaar kaa elaan kiya
 Hindi writers, along with Gaja Baje, went and took dozens of awards ranging from four lakhs to forty thousand from the lotuses of UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 tab kisi ko kuch bhi yaad nahin aayaa
 The remembrance did not come even when Comrade Pansare was murdered or in the true sense of the murder of Dabholkar Sahib
 naa tab kisi ne sahitya academy par sawaal uthaae or naa hi sahitya academy se stand lene kaa duraagrah kiya
 Because there was no threat to ideology directly and indirectly to the governments of the time
 ek najar daalate hai puraskaar waapas karanevaale lekhakon par
 Uday Prakash is no longer able to take the award from Yogi Adityanath to discuss or take him seriously
 baat karenge ashok vaajapeyi or krishna sobati kii
 While reminding you that Uday Prakash has been considering Ashok Vajpayee as a power broker and claims that he does not take him seriously in Hindi but it is also interesting that Ashok Vajpayee member of the jury who gave Uday Prakash the Sahitya Akademi Award Were
 darasal in sahityak puraskaron kii saakh khatm ho chuki he
 Look at an example that when Sitakant Mahapatra was Secretary of the Ministry of Culture, he gets the Jnanpith Award and Ashok Vajpayee, Joint Secretary in the same Ministry gets the Sahitya Akademi Award
 kya iske peeche medha yaa pratibha he yaa kuch or
 Apart from this, Ashok Vajpayee had received the Dayawati Modi Award, then there is no need to repeat the controversy surrounding it
 ashok vaajapeyi kitne samvedansheel hai isko samajhane ke liye bhopal gas traasadee ke baad yojit kavi sammelan ke daur ke unke bayaan ko yaad karnaa chahie
 Then Ashok Vajpayee said that one does not die with the one who dies
 is tarah ke bayanon ke baad ab jab vahi shaks sanvadenshiltaa kii ummid karata he to uskaa apekshit asar nahin hota he
 Needless to say that Ashok Vajpayee's statements and return of the award did not have the same effect
 darasal sahityak puraskaron kii saakh pichley kai saalon main chhijati chali gai
 Who is responsible for this, the writer community should consider it, Krishna Sobti also announced the return of Sahitya Akademi Award after the threat to the pluralistic culture of the country, once upon a time Krishna ji said about the prizes that a few literary people It is convenient to go to the bar of India International Center in Delhi, where many issues of literature are decided, now if the literary award ia So many are set in the time it should be returned, in fact, the motivations behind the conflict also needs to be understood
 centre sarkaar ne ford foundation samet kai gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ke videshi chandon par roak laga di he
 There should also be an investigation as to why the protest of the litterateurs after this move of the government caught up
 kyonki baat niklegi ko dur talak jaaegi

 iske baad unhone ye bhi kaha, "har baar kangana par bharosa karnaa sahi nahin
 "what did Kangana say in response? Kangam felt bad about Sonam and in a hurry, Kangana also issued a statement
 jisamen wo likhti hai, "sonam ko ye haq koun detaa he ki wo mujhe jaj karen
 Does Sonam have a license as to which woman to trust and not
 mere aaropon par wo kaise sawaal uthaa sakati hai
 i have presented my country on many international forums

 Sonam is neither seen as a good actress nor a good speaker

 "kangana has dragged not only Sonam but also her family in her statement
 kangana dwaara diye gaye is statement ke baad ab ye dekhnaa vaaki dilachasp he ki sonam kapur iskaa kya jawaab detii hai
 What is the whole matter, how it started? Let us know that this case is during the promotional tour of Phantom film "bombay Velvet" made in 2015
 film ke kru main shaamil ek mahila ne "hafington post" ke saath intervyuu main vikaas par chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya
 The woman said that she had also complained to Anurag Kashyap of Phantom Films

 jab ham film queen kii shooting kar rahe the tab bhi vikaas vivaahit the lekin wo rojaanaa nae partner ke saath shaareerik sambandh banane kaa zikr karte the
 Vikas used to party every night and embarrassed me for not attending these parties
 vikaas jab bhi kahin milte wo ajeeb tareeke se mujhe gale lagaate, mere baalo ko soonghtey or kehete ki unhen is khushboo se pyaar he
 "kangana said," i used to think that there was something wrong with her
 ab phantum films ke khatm ho jane ke baad is baat kii zyada se zyada charchaa ho rahi he
 But this issue was also raised earlier and it was suppressed very easily
 " Following the Supreme Court's order, the CBI in the Unnao case is speeding up its investigation
 sibiai pataa lagane main lagi he ki unnav rape peedita kii car se trek kii takkar aakhir kaise hui ? kya ye mahaj ek haadasa tha yaa phir thi koi sajeesh
 The scope of the cbi's investigation extends to the truck owner as well as the Raebareli dealer, Shohrab, besides the driver and cleaner
 jaankaree ke mutabik, 28 july kii subah sabhi trek dealer shoharaab ke paas pahunche the or jiske baad trek ke waapas lautate vakt takkar hui thi
 The CBI will also investigate a finance company official from Kanpur
 sibiai ne jaanch main jin kirdaaron poochtacha kii he ve is cese main ahm kadi hai
 In the Unnao case, what all of them said in the CBI inquiry, Aaj Tak investigated those aspects
 aapako bataa den ki unnav cese main sabase zyada surkhiyon main rahaa he ki trek ke aage kii number plate par greece laga hua tha jabaki peeche ke number par nahin
 The second truck whose number plate is messed up (photo-arvind Ojha) Number 1 truck character Devendra Palasi has been questioned by truck owner Devendra Pal in the CBI case
 vahiin devendra paal kaa kahana he ki maine hi driver ashish paal ko kaha tha ki aage ke number plate par greece laga de
 Our installment (EMI) was broken several times in between
 finance company ne notice 15 july ko bheja tha, jo 28 july ko mila tha
 But the installment broke for several months apart from the month of March, so to avoid the finance company, i said to install Greece
 devendra paal kaa kahana he kist tuutane par financer list nikalataa he jo sij karne waalon ke paas jaati he
 The list brings out the Delhi head office
 sij karne vaale har jile main hote hai
 They started seizing the car, so Greece was installed
 hamaare paas notice kii copy bhi he, agar company waalon se list nikalwai jaae to pataa chal jayega
 Devendra has been questioned once before
 ravivaar ko lakhanu main phir se sibiai poochtacha karegi or devendra paal ke bayanon ko vairifai bhi karegi
 Along with this, CBI is also investigating the call details of Devendra Pal
 ( trek maalik devendra paal notice kii copy dikhaate hue photo-arvind ojha )sibiai kaa cese main kirdaar nambar-2 naam shoharabshoharaab raibareli kaa wo dealer he jiske paas hameshaa trek aata he or ye trek kaa maal bikwaata he saath hi bich main dallali ke paise kamata he
 Shohrab says that 4 trucks arrived that day
 jis trek se accident hua tha, un sabhi main aage ke number plate par greece laga hua tha par use waapas jate vakt nahin dekha tha
 But the remaining 3 trucks also had grease
 aage shoharaab kaa kahana he ki barish ke din main kamai nahin ho paati isliye kist tut jaati he
 Apart from this, ITO people also cut the challan online, so also put grease on the front number plate so that the number plate is not visible
 greece keval aage ke nambar plate par lagaate hai
 The rear numbers are not placed on the plate
 photo- shoharaab kii safed shart, baitha hua he (photo-arvind ojha)sibiai kaa kirdaar nambar 3- shashi singh kaleshanshashi singh kaleshan kaa kahana he kist (EMI) kaa mudda tha, lekin apane graahakon ke saath aisa vyavhaar nahin karte, wo hamaara acha graahak he
 The truck owner must have planted grease for his personal reasons
 aapako bataa den ki har finance company har jile ke pahalwaan, bounsar ko recovery agent ke taur par rakhte hai
 The installments keep an eye on the breakers
 sibiai kii najar is company par bhi rahegi or company ke document ke aadhaar par ye jaanane kii koshish karegi ki trek maalik devendra paal sach bol rahaa he yaa nahin
 Apart from all this, the CBI is questioning the driver and cleaner on remand

 It says that Sasikala has given two crore rupees to the officials as a bribe
 yahaan tak ki diaiji ne dijipi ko bhi isamen shaamil bataaya he
 According to DG Satyanarayan, if the DIG had seen something like this inside the jail, he should have discussed it with us
 yadi unhen lagata he ki maine kuch kiya to main kisi bhi jaanch ke liye taiyaar hum
 Satyanarayan Rao had said that Sasikala was exempted only under Rule 584 of the Karnataka Precision Manual
 is rule ke mutabik shashikala ab 15 dinon main 4 se 6 mulakatiyon se hi mil sakengi
 In fact, according to the Karnataka Jail Manuel, the prison in question can meet their lawyers or acquaintances and relatives twice a week, while the punishment is 2 times in 15 days
 shikala ko march main chunaav ayog ke saath-saath court orders kii formaleties puri karne ke liye party or vakeelon se lagaataar milanaa pad rahaa tha
 Taking these circumstances into consideration, the jail administration may have given Sasikala some leeway

 jiske darbar main har manokamana puri hoti he
 In whose court, there is fullness and prosperity from all over the Nine Navane
 wo darbar he pratham poojya sarvasiddhi daayak bhagwaan shri ganesh kaa jo virajman hai siddhivinayak ganpati mandir main
 As soon as you step into the Prabhadevi area of mumbai, the urn of Siddhivinayak Temple starts to appear from a distance and with it the holy flag which is like a watchdog, welcomes every devotee who comes towards it
 ye dhvaj maano bakhaan kar rahaa ho us param shakti kaa jisaki aradhana ke bina kisi bhi shubh kaam kaa aarambh nahin hota
 It is believed that Siddhivinayak himself appeared in this temple
 samay beetaa or uske saath-saath har bhakt ke man main bhagwaan siddhivinayak ke liye shraddha badhati chali gai jo aaj bhi kaayam he, yahi kaaran he ki kabhi yahaan bade se bade nayak nange pair apane parivaar ke saath paidal chal kar aate hai or samruddhi kii kaamana karte hai to yaheen jindagi ke utaar chadhaav se mukti kii kaamana lekar karondon bhakt apni argiyaan lagaate hai
 It is the court of Lord Ganpati who is sad, where there is accomplishment and prosperity
 jo yahaan aata he wo apana astitv bhul jaataa he or bhagwaan siddhivinayak ganpati kii mahima ke saamne natmastak ho jaataa he
 Be it water to get rid of any problem or start any auspicious work
 bhakt sabase pehle vinayak ke darbar main aakar bhagwaan ke saamne sheesh jhukaate hai or phir unase vardaan maangate hai
 As it is morning, there is a rush of devotees for Siddhivinayak's darshan
 vinayak ke darshanon ke liye jane vaale bhakt modak, nariyal or pushp le janaa nahin bhoolatey, kyonki aisi manyata he ki modak or nariyal ke bhoga se siddhivinayak jald prasann hote hai or bhakton kii har manokamana puri karte hai
 The worship of Siddhivinayak Ganapati begins among the drums

 There is a snake wrapped on the abdomen through the left shoulder and an eye teak on the forehead is beautified in the same way as Shiva's third eye
 siddhivinayak rup main bhagwaan kii sabase badi visheshta he is murti main bappa kii sound
 Generally, the trunk of Ganapati is curved to the left, but the trunk of Lord Siddhivinayak is curved to the right and is called Navasacha Ganapati i

 ganpati ke donon ore riddhi or siddhi kii pratimaayein bhi maujuud hai jo is baat kaa pratik hai ki bhagwaan ganesh buddhi or parakram dete hai jabaki riddhi-siddhi sukh or samruddhi
 The statue of his favorite vehicle, Mushkaraj, is located near Lord Siddhivinayak
 aisi manyata he ki apni manokamana mooshakaraj ke kaan main kah dene se wo jald puri hoti he
 Lord Hanuman is also seated on one side of Lord Siddhivinayak's pavilion
 aisa mana jaataa he ki koi agar hanuman ji ke darshan kiye bina chalaa jaae ko bhagwaan siddhivinayak kii aradhana kaa punya nahin miltaa yahi vajah he ki bhagwaan siddhivinayak ke saath hanuman ji kii aradhana kaa mahatv he
 According to mythological beliefs, Hanuman himself appeared here during the excavation

 court ne kaha, 'aapaki lagaai gai janhit yachika ko criminal rit pitishan main tabdeel kar diya gaya he
 So, the victim girl in this case should be made the petitioner in this case
 ' bataa den ki yachika ek enjio ne lagaai thi
 Therefore, the court's question was how the petition could be heard without making the affected party a party
 filhal yachikakarta ne yachika ko waapas le liya he
 The court has told the petitioner that after making the victim a party, a petition can be filed again in the High Court

 There has been a steady volatility in batting at number-4 for Team India

 India had fielded 11 batsmen at number four since the 2015 World Cup
 2019 world cap ke baad chauthe number par ballebaaji karne vaale khilaadiyon kii sankhya 13 ho gai he

 His dream was shattered by this weakness of India in 2019 World Cup

 Rahul had to shift from number 4 to the opening due to Dhawan dropping out of the 2019 World Cup
 vanade main is ballebaaji kram par bhartiya team kaa experiment lagaataar jari he or westeindies daure par bhi team number chaar par prayog karne ke liye taiyaar he
 KL Rahul, Shreyas Iyer and Manish Pandey have been included as the number 4 batsman in the ODI team against the West Indies
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki bharat kii number chaar kii talash khatm hoti he yaa nahin
 After Yuvraj Singh in the Indian team, no batsman has been confirmed as the number 4 batsman till date
 khud captain viraat kohli bhi number 4 par acha pradarshan nahin kar paae
 The number 4 batsman is expected to score at a strike rate of 80–90
 vanade main bich ke overon main uski takanic spinneron or tej gendbaajon ke khilaaf bahut shandaar ho
 He rotates the strike in the middle overs and also hits fours and sixes when needed

 According to Sobhraj, there was not a single witness in the present case or any evidence to prove that he was in Nepal in 1975
 vartmaan maamla paristhitijanya sabooton ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 The Kathmandu office of HRC said that it had not 'acquitted' Sobhraj, but had expressed 'specific concerns' about his trial and the condition of detaining him
 use 'bikni killer' bhi kaha jaataa he kyonki uski kathith shikaar hippie yuvatiyaan hoti thim
 When her body was retrieved from the sea of andaman, she was in her swim suit
 use 'saanp' bhi kaha jaataa he kyonki vah asia kii jelon se kai baar bhaag niklaa
 Sobhraj was arrested in 2003 from a casino in Kathmandu on a murder charge in Nepal in 1975
 apane bachaav main uskaa kahana tha ki vah 2003 se pehle kabhi nepal nahin aayaa
 Nepali police told the court that he had traveled as a citizen of the Netherlands in the name of Henriques Bintanja
 us samay maamle kii jaanch karne vaale vishwa laal shreshth ko yaad he ki unhone shobhraj se bintanja ke rup main poochtacha kii thi
 Shrestha says, "A day after making the inquiry, he came back again with the excuse that he had missed his gold Parker pen
" hamane use dhundhane kii koshish kii
 We later realized that he had just come to find out if we had any doubt about him
 ''antat unhone use kaid kar rakhaa he, nepali sarkaar is baat par puraa dhyaan de rahi he ki vah bhaagane na paae
 Sobhraj is housed in the jail's highly guarded lockup 'golghar', which is a separate cell inside the jail
 isamen kukhyat aparaadhiyon ke liye chah kothriyaan hai
 Among his associates in these cells is Virendra Pradhan, a teacher who killed a teenage student
 haal tak sthaneey media kaarobaari yusuf ansaari bhi isi jail main tha
 Two months ago, a man who had come to meet Sobhraj tried to kill Ansari
 shobhraj kaa daawa tha ki punjab ke is hamalavar jagajeet singh ko vah nahin jaanata lekin jail adhikariyon kaa kahana tha ki pichley kuch maheenon main vah shobhraj se 21 baar mil chukaa tha
 He can go to the prison library, has a television set for him, and in the courtyard he practices martial arts
 central jail ke ek adhikari ke anusaar, uski pramukh shikaayat he ki use baahar jane kii ijaajat nahin he
 "he no longer has to appear in court as the Supreme Court has refused to reconsider his case," says the jail official
 yahaan tak ki jab vah biimaar padataa he, use aspataal nahin le jaaya jaataa or doctor use dekhne aata he
 Sobhraj complained of a toothache in January this year
 uske chaar kharaab daant thik kiye gaye
 The dentist treated him in the cell
 adhikariyon ne uske daanton ke ilaaj par 60,000 ru
 Spent
 haalanki hafte main do baar log usase milane aa sakate hai, lekin jail adhikari najar rakhte hai
 Despite close monitoring, two years ago he managed to organize a stolen marriage ceremony in jail
 usne khubasurat nepali dubhashiya nihitha biswas ke saath vivaah kar liya
 She was just 22 years old
 nihitha kii maa shakuntla thapa ab shobhraj kii vakil he
 Thapa says, "one day my daughter came to me and said, Mama, i am going to marry a foreigner
" maine usase poocha kya charles se? meri beti bahut ziddee he, main jaanati thi ki main manaa karuungi, main buree ban jaaoongi
 This is the destiny
 ''biswas parivaar ke liye yah aasaan nahin tha
 Thapa says sighing, "he didn't even have a boyfriend before Charles
" kuch log kehete ki baaki ladkiyaan ladakon ke saath coffee pine jaati hai lekin hamaari nihitha sidhe central jail jaati thi
 He fell in love
 '' thapa kaa pati kolkata kaa rahane vaala tha
 She left the family when Nihita was 15 years old
 ''hamaare sabhi rishtedaar iske khilaaf the lekin nanu (nihitha) kaa kahana tha ki use sirf charles chahie
 She says, 'that is my true love' though she cannot touch her husband's cheek in jail
 ''vivaah samaaroh 2008 main jail main hua, mambeti 'dashain' (dashahra) ke din sindur or thali lekar jail main gayi
 The bride wore an unbuttoned pink and black dress, the groom wearing a white shirt and his special cap
 jail ke paharedaaron ne yah soch kar sindur le jane diya ki vah tikaa he
 Thapa told, "sobhraj put a pearl necklace to my daughter who works with Mangalasutra here
 '' bhav-vibhor nihitha ne vivaah kii pushti kii, usne media ko bataaya ki use pehali najar main pyaar ho gaya, ''usne meri ankhon main jhank kar dekha or main sab kuch bhul gai
 “children like Nihita, whom these people from Hindi film songs (especially from Pakistan)
 
 
 ) par naachna behad pasand tha, achaanak rakshak kii bhoomika main aa gai
 She strongly believes in her husband's innocence
 usne india today ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue kaha ki kuch sawaal ''vibhats'' the, usne kaha, ''main jaanati hum ki charles doodh kaa dhulaa nahin he lekin mujhe samaj main nahin aata ki aap sirf kanoonee sajaa kii baat kyon karnaa chaahati hai, kanoonee aazaadee kii kyon nahin? agar nepal ke faisle se kuch sabit hota he to vah yah he ki nyaaypalika ne khud ko sharmasaar karne ke alaava kuch nahin kiya
 Nihita is saddened by the media's criticism of her marriage and she remains silent about meeting the press
 thapa kaa kahana he, ''use charles se behad prem he
 She is a (different kind of) girl from Hut
 kripaya aisa kuch mat likhiegaa jisase meri beti ko nuksaan pahunche
 She is naive, i will not allow this
 '' unhone kaha, ''ek akhbaar main unki tasviir he jisamen likhaa he hue parfact match?' mujhe prashnchihn acha nahin laga, kripaya meri beti ko thes mat pahunchie
 According to Nihita, Nepal's "illegal punishment" has upset her badly
 ''lekin isse hamen kamjor nahin padana chahie, mere liye or unke liye yahaan chijen mushkil ho gai hai
 Do not make fun of us
 unki rihaai ke baad main dekhuungi ki sab kuch badale
 Nihita recently gave Sobhraj a white mouse to entertain him
 vah uske liye rojaanaa khanepine kaa saamaan kharidne jaati he
 Thapa recalls, "when Sobhraj's cat got sick, he asked her for Amul milk for the cat
" maine usase kaha ki main tumhaare liye khargosh laauungi, tum use maar kar billi ko khilaa dena lekin usne kaha, mom main khun nahin kar saktaa
 Nihita and Sobhraj are not the first romance in jail
 bharat kii tihaad jail main 21 varsh kii kaid ke dauraan, 50 varsh se adhik umr ke is ladi killer ne 34 varsh kii ek german mahila jaclyn castor se prem jataayaa, jo nashile padaarth se jude kanoon ke antargat jail main band thi
 Some of the letters written to him are with India Today
 yuva or sidhi-saadi nihitha ke saath uskaa vivaah castor ke saath prem jataane jaisaa hi he
 In the letters, Charles guides Custer in such a way as to bring media attention to him
 usne usase kaha, ''mujhe media ko sanbhaalane do
 It is in our interest
 '' usne castor ko sikhaaya ki apane prem ko romantic tareeke se kaise pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 
 
 In order to make the headline that Charles Sobhraj has fallen in love
 kahani ke anusaar, castor ko media ko bataanaa tha ki donon ke bich ''dhire-dhire acchhee baatcheet hone lagi, vah dosti main badali phir pyaar ho gaya
 Our relationship was connected to mentality
 '' vah samajhataa tha ki isse unki ''chhavi or gambhir'' ho jaaegi
 Sobhraj drew from Elvis Presley's lyrical lines (will You Be My Teddy Bear), calling him Maa Cherry and Mine Libkin and quoting the French poet Paul Varlen: i love you today / tomorrow Less than / but more than yesterday
 kai baar vah saadhaaran tareeke se castor se kahata tha,''mujhe apane dil or dimag par zyada mat chadhaao, main jaisaa hum vaisaa hi hum, saral, or main chahta hum ki main jaisaa bhi hum, tum mujhase prem karo
 
 
 As i told you, i am not the best, but i will try to be the best for you
 '' use chintaa thi ki baaki log uske khilaaf uske dimag main baaten bhar denge or use saavdhaan kar denge, ''jail main band un logon kii baaten mat suno jo hamaare bare main baat karte hai
 They should not make any sense and they are very foolish, their life and mind is so small that none of them can advise you about anything
 
 
 '' yahaan tak ki uske sabase zyada bhavuk kshanon main bhi media kabhi uske dimag se dur nahin rahaa
 He writes, "I love and love and love you, we have both gone mad
 
 
 hamaari mulaakaat or prem kii kahani par ek acchhee film ban sakati he
 "seeing his letter also shows how he took advantage of the prison system
" vah dilli ke alengepi aspataal main castor ke saath mulaakaat tay karata tha taaki ve ek hi samay par vahaan pahunchen
 "in the OPD, i was given time at 9:30 in the morning, but i would arrive at 10 o'clock so that my appointment was canceled and i had to come again
 ham hafte main kam se kam ek baar alengepi main milenge
 He had three girlfriends in Delhi's Tihar Jail for 21 years
 pehali yuva bhartiya vakil, sneh senger, jisaki jagah jaldi hi castor ne le lee
 He later wooed a Punjabi girl, Manbina Fuller, who fell in love with her after reading her biography
 shobhraj kaa kahana tha ki vah phullar se vivaah karnaa chahta tha lekin use dar tha ki ladki ke matapita aapatti karenge
 What happens in India
 aap jaanate hi hai
 He met Rajan Pillai, Sukhram and Chandraswamy in Tihar and used to tell journalists about him while appearing in court
 sukhram ke bare main ek baar usne kaha tha, ''ve bahut budhimaan nahin hai lekin main samajhataa hum ki netaa ke taur par thik he
 He filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) saying that Pillai's death in Tihar Jail in 1995 was the result of extortion and harassment
 piiel ke anusaar, ''uske (pillai) saath galigalouj kii jaati thi, dhamkaaya jaataa tha or paisa maanga jaataa tha, laat maari jaati thi, yahaan tak ki farsh saaf karne ko kaha jaataa tha
 Her health was not paid enough attention
 piiel main yah bhi khulaasa kiya gaya tha ki kis tarah ek adhikari ne pillai se maaruti car maangi thi, jabaki ek anya chahta tha ki patni se milane kii ijaajat dene se pehle use paisa diya jaae
 Sobhraj said while leaving India, "india's courts are impartial
 '' uske khush hone kii vajah thi kyonki francisi paryatak luk solomon kii hatya ke liye adaalat ne use bari kar diya tha
 Now that he is again being convicted of murder, he is claiming a wrongful trial
 ab agar vah nepal kii adaalat ke faisle ko palatney main kaamyaab hota he, to charles shobhraj ke aparaadh ke jivan main ek or adhyay jud jayega

 He talks to the people and in a democracy if you talk to the people, it cannot be called good
 ham logon se baat karnaa chaahate hai
 Rahul Gandhi tries to talk to people in his own way
 ’ The External Affairs Minister said, 'modi's style is that what he said is the ultimate truth
 kisi ko bhi unase sawaal karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 ' congress ke varisht netaa khurshid ne rajasthan main ek raily ke dauraan rahul dwaara die gaye us bayaan kaa bhi bachaav kiya jisamen congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha tha ki pakistani khufia agency iesai mujffarnagar main hui sampradayik hinsa ke kuch peediton se sampark kar rahi he
 Khurshid said, "the Bombay bomb blasts had nothing to do with Dawood or Dawood had nothing to do with ISI
" unhone bombai kaa shoshan kiya or hamen is shoshan se jarur ladanaa chahie
 Rahul Gandhi is saying the same thing in other words
 hamen kisi bhi shoshan se ladanaa he
 The way to fight exploitation is to not let anyone become psychologically weak
 ’ Khurshid also slammed the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, saying, 'is it not a double statement that Modi says that Rahul Gandhi should apologize for his remarks while the Sangh says that Rahul is right
 modi sangh se kyon nahin kehete ki rahul ko sahi tehraane ke liye vah maafee maange
 Obviously they should first ask their people for forgiveness
 ’ The Union Minister said, 'the picture is yet to come
 kahani abhi khatm nahin hui
 The story is not just about defeat and victory
 modi sochate hai ki yah mudda haar-jeet kaa he
 For us, it is not a win-win situation
 hamaare liye yah bharat ke vichaar (idia of india) ke bare main he
 If we lose and the idea of india survives, then we have no problem
 lekin yadi ham jeet jate hai or bharat ke vichaar kaa vajood nahin rahata to yah kuch bhi nahin he
 ' khurshid ne kaha, ‘modi bharat ke vichaar ke thik ulat hai or bharat kaa vichaar jivit rahegaa
 The idea of india will always be more powerful than Modi and therefore the idea of india is alive and will remain, the fight is not between Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi
 ladaai bharat ke vichaar kii khatir hindustan ke dilodimag kii he
 ' saudi arab main vaarshik haj yatra par nikle paanch bhartiya shraddhaluon kii maut ho gai he

 tippaniyan According to the report, Pakistani officials have said that in view of the increase in India's nuclear weapons, the Government of Pakistan may need to do the same
 parmaanu hathiyaaron ko prayog karne kii seemaa rekha ko sankuchit karne ke saath-saath pakistan bharat ke paaramparik sainya abhiyaanon ke khilaaf apni parmanvik pratirodh kshamta badhaane ke liye gaiyr-kootnithik parmaanu hathiyaar bhi taiyaar kar saktaa he

 haalanki usne is jakhire kaa aakaar isse zyada bada hone kii bhi sambhaavna jataai
 The CRS said Islamabad has never given detailed information about its nuclear program, but its 'minimum deterrence capability' is believed to be able to thwart any military operation against India
 report ke mutabik, pakistani adhikari aisa kah chuke hai ki bharat ke parmaanu hathiyaaron main vruddhi ko dekhte hue pakistan sarkaar ko bhi aisa hi karne kii jarurat pad sakati he
 Along with narrowing the borderline for using nuclear weapons, Pakistan can also design non-diplomatic nuclear weapons to increase its nuclear deterrence against India's conventional military operations

 jaisaa ki naam se hi lagata he, reverse repo rate upar bataae gaye repo rate se ulta hua
 Think of it like this: Banks often have a large balance left over after a day's work
 bank vah rakam apane paas rakhane ke jaay rigerv bank main rakh sakate hai, jis par unhen arabiai se byaaj bhi miltaa he
 The rate at which they receive this interest is called reverse repo rate
 vaise kai baar rigerv bank ko lagata he ki bazaar main bahut zyada nakadi ho gai he tab vah reverse repo rate main badhotaree kar detaa he
 It happens that banks start keeping their money with the Reserve Bank to earn more interest

 com / ml6it7xson train se judi khaas baaten Around 25,000 foreign tourists planning to travel to Kailash Mansarovar in Tibet via Nepal are having to make significant changes to their plans, as China has closed all borders adjoining Tibet following a severe earthquake in the Himalayan nation
 maansarovar yatra ke liye jane waalon main zyaadaatar bhartiya hai
 Nepal's tourism ministry has asked the foreign minister to take up the issue with the Chinese authorities
 mantralay ne kaha he ki nepal ke raste 25,000 videshi paryatakon ke kailash maansarovar jane se desh ko laabh hoga
 That too in a difficult time when the tourism industry of Nepal has suffered a lot due to the terrible earthquake of April 25
 bhartiya, roosi, malaysian or anya europea deshon se aane vaale 25,000 paryatakon ne nepal kii 38 paryaton companiyon ke madhyam se apni yatra kii yojana banaai he
 China has closed the border at Tattapani, Rasuwa and other places in view of possible difficulties in landslides and travel
 uski “divine” shaktiyon par bhale hi uske shikaar peediton kii chaaya pad chuki ho, lekin asaram baapu kaa aabhamandal ab bhi jas kaa tas he
 Asaram has been in Jodhpur jail since August 2013, but his tricks are not taking the name of stoppage
 jodhpur or ahmedabad main darj balaatkaar ke do maamalon main kul das gavaahon main se teen maare ja chuke hai, ek pichley teen maheene se laapata he or paanchvaan lagaataar dar ke saaye main ji rahaa he, kyonki uske ghar ke bheetar hi uske upar asaram ke gundon ne jaanaleva hamalaa kar diya tha
 Even if the police is investigating in these cases, it is so lethargic that the fear of the remaining witnesses is becoming strong that Asaram has his hand behind all this and he will not leave them
 masalan, uttar pradesh ke shahjahanpur main, jahaan asaram ke khilaaf balaatkaar kaa mukadmaa darj karaane vaali ladki apane parivaar ke saath rahati he, police ne gavaahon par hamale kii jaanch main bahut kam pragati kii he
 LIC agent Kripal Singh, a friend of the victim's father Charanvir (name changed), was shot dead while returning home
 do din baad hui maut se pehle unhone asaram ke teen sahyogiyon arjuna, raghav or sanjeev kumaar kaa naam liya tha jinhone un par goli chalaai
 All three are still absconding, while six months have passed since the incident
 jin do vyaktiyon narayan pandey or pradeep ko pakadaa gaya he, charanvir ke mutabik ve golibari main shaamil nahin the balki inhone to teenon hamalaavaron ke liye sirf maukey kaa muyna kiya tha
 Shahjahanpur Superintendent of Police Bablu Kumar told India Today, “we are trying our best to nab the real culprits
 surat se lekar jodhpur police tak hamane sabase sampark saadhaa he
 "charanveer has also handed over a tape of 20 minutes of phone conversation to the police which allegedly took place between Kripal and Asaram on September 23, 2014, in which Asaram is telling him from inside the jail in Jodhpur that Charanvir Persuade him to withdraw the case by taking money
 charanvir ko bharosa he ki yah aawaaj asaram kii hi he
 That voice says, "you explain to them
 ” us aawaaj main kaha jaataa he ki kuch paise advance ke taur par de die jaaenge or baad main “sau taka” (asaram kii bhashaa main 10 lakh) ve de denge
 Shahjahanpur police has not yet conducted this voice test
 is kaam main sirf teen din lagate hai lekin chah maheene guzar chuke hai
 When asked about this, Kumar's reply was, "the sound in the tape was not clear, so we did not think it necessary to have it tested
 ”charanvir kaa aarope he ki ise asaram kii aawaaj maanane kii kai vajahen hai
 The first thing is that if his voice was not his, then the most common thing for his supporters was to file a defamation suit against the channel that ran the tape
 baad kii ghatnaon se samaj main aata he ki aawaaj kya kah rahi he
 In the tape, that voice is found saying to Kripal that he will get the doctors' report on 23 September (on the basis of which he was seeking interim bail)
 es
 N
 medical college, jodhpur ke doctoron ne haalanki jo report di, usamen kaha gaya tha ki use trigeminal neuralgia he or iske liye surgery kerani hogi
 After Charanvir's appeal to the Supreme Court, Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) was asked to conduct a medical examination of Asaram
 ekwas kii report ne nishkarsh diya ki asaram ko surgery kii jarurat nahin he
 Shahjahanpur police have also not investigated the murderous attack on Dainik Jagran journalist Narendra Yadav, who campaigned against this rape scandal named "asaram Aafat Mein"
 yadav par agyaat hamalaavaron ne 17 sitambar, 2014 ko chaakuon se hamalaa kiya tha
 Asaram's operatives paid him five lakhs to withdraw the expedition and not help Charanvir
 kii rishwat kii peshkash kii thi
 No arrests have been made so far in this case
 haal hi main uttar pradesh main police mahanideshak kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaalane vaale javed ahamed ne is bare main puche jane par kaha, “ham praathamikta ke aadhaar par in maamalon ko lenge or sabko insaaf dilavaayenge
 Shared grief is the grief shared by the families of the people who tried to bring out the truth of this controversial Baba
 kisi kii maut hui he to kisi ne apana ang ganvaaya he
 Ram Kumar Sachan, who lives in Nimda village, 100 km from Kanpur, is sad as his son Rahul has been missing since November 25, 2015
 asaram ke maamle main ahm gavaah rahul ko farvari 2015 main jodhpur kii jila adaalat main ek sunwaayee ke liye jate vakt asaram ke bhakt satya narayan gwaala ne chaaku maar diya tha
 In this attack he was partially paralyzed and his memory was also lost
 uske upar hamale ke silsile main jodhpur police ko die bayaan main sachaan ne kaha tha ki unhone asaram ko gwaala se ishaare main chaaku maarane ko kehete dekha tha
 Sachan had moved to Lucknow after the attack and demanded 24-hour security from the police
 isaki bajaae unhen sirf aath ghante ke liye ek surakshakarmi muhaiyaa karavaaya gaya
 Sachan went missing on 25 November but his security guard Amit Kumar Singh wrote a complaint to the police on 12 December
 is bare main puche jane par sab-inspector vijay pandey halake main kisi sajeesh kii baat ko nakaar dete hai, “hamen bharosa he ki sachaan laut aaenge kyonki ve khud hi gaayab hue hai
 "they don't give any ear to Asaram about any danger
 rahul ke pita kehete hai, “sirf teen sambhaavnaaen hai
 He is either killed or kidnapped at the behest of Asaram or he has hidden himself due to some undisclosed reason
 ”mahendra chawla ko isamen koi shaq nahin ki sachaan kii hatya ho gai he
 Asaram's son Narayan Sai's personal aide and witness in the cases against the two, Chawla was shot dead in his native village Sanoli Khurd near Panipat with a desi katta
 unhone police ko thos saboot die the, phir bhi is maamle main ab tak koi giraftaar nahin hui he
 He said in his complaint that he had to pay Rs 1 crore for not being a witness in Asaram's case
 kii rishwat kii peshkash kii gai thi
 Nishant Ghanaghas, a local lawyer from Panipat and a devotee of Asaram, had shown him cash in a suitcase, which he had told the police
 ghanghas ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha, lekin chawla kaa aarope he ki police ne uske khilaaf aisa kamjor maamla banaaya ki use teen din main hi jamaanat mil gai
 Chawla had told the police that Asaram's bodyguard Hanuman had threatened to kill him as he was hurting Asaram's interests
 sarkari shikaayat ke baavjood us par koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 When asked about this, Rohtak Range Inspector General of Police Shrikant Yadav says, “SP Sharma of Panipat would be better aware of this but as far as i know, the investigation is still going on
 ek baar narayan sai se poochtacha ke baad chijen aage badhengi
 We have demanded the Gujarat Police to hand him over to us
 ” sharma se unke cellphone yaa dakratar main koi sampark nahin ho paaya
 Chawla says that two days before Sachan went missing from Lucknow, he called Chawla and said, "tomorrow there will be an earthquake
" ” ve sai kii patni janaki ke bare main kah rahe the jinhone 24 november ko media ke saamne aakar baap-bete ke kukarmon kaa pardaafash kiya tha
 Chawla says that Sachan had sent a message on whatsapp to Narendra Yadav, "one thing that is common in the deadly assaults on Asaram's trial witnesses in Uttar Pradesh or Haryana is that the police deliberately kept the investigation loose or Say that she is acting directly as told by Asaram while the allegations against Asaram are credible and convincing
 police ne jaan-boojhkar asaram se poochtacha nahin kii he
 In Sachan's case it is clear that he has become the target of Asaram because he inspired Janaki
 ”sibiai se guhaaraaj chawla avsaad main hai
 He says, "if this is the attitude of the police, then we are not expected to survive unless the Supreme Court orders a CBI inquiry under its supervision and Asaram himself is interrogated
" ” narendra chandra gupta bhi isi kii ummid lagaae baithe hai
 Akhil Gupta's father says only a CBI inquiry into these murders can save him
 akhil gupta 2005 tak asaram ke nijee sahyogi or rasoie rahe the jo baad main unke khilaaf gavaah ban gaye
 Gupta was shot in Muzaffarnagar on January 11, 2015 when he was on his way home from his dairy on a motorcycle
 is hatya ko bhi saal bhar biit gaya lekin ab tak koi giraftaar nahin hui he
 Akhil's father says, "the UP government had announced that it would investigate the murder of my son with the CBI but nothing has happened so far
" main pradhanmantri narendra modi se apni raksha kii guhaar lagaataa hum
 Now that is our expectation
 ” India won the match against former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar Kumar's 100-run partnership against Sri Lanka
 ek samay to aisa lag rahaa tha ki bharat match haar jayega
 But even after losing 7 wickets at 131 we won the match by 3 wickets
 dhoni ne 63 ranon main 45 ranon kii pari kheli, to vahiin bhubaneshwar ne bhi 80 gendon par 4 chauke or 1 chakke kii madad se shandaar 53 ran banaae
 But during the match there came a time when the match was slipped by hand
 lay main lautaa sabase bada 'match finishr', dhoni main abhi dam he!yah tha mahendra singh dhoni kaa wicket, vishwa fernando ne match ke 35wein over main dhoni ko bold kar diya tha
 The third ball of this over of Fernando went straight to the stumps through Dhoni's bat and legs, but despite this, Dhoni could not get out
 darasal, ball stump par to lagi, lekin bels nahin giri jisaki vajah se unhen out qaraar nahin diya gaya

 com / ti2upgloyt — Virat Kohli (@ Cricvids1) August 24, 2017 Dhoni was batting for 29 at the moment and India, who were in trouble, needed 59 more to win
 dhoni ke out hone ke baad kisi bhi ballebaaj kaa wicket bharat ke paas surakshit nahin tha
 Dhoni's last chance to prove himself for the 2019 World Cup: There has been a lot of constant questioning to the critics, for a long time, whether Dhoni's time is over now, should he leave the game now
 chif silector emesake prasad ne bhi kaha tha ki dhoni kii jagah team main pakki nahin he, agar wo parform karenge to hi team main chayan hoga
 By playing the role of match finisher once again, Dhoni proved that he still has power

 Banwari Lal Singhal, BJP MLA from Alwar city assembly of Rajasthan has once again made a controversial statement against the Muslim society
 vidhayak ne muslim samaaj ke khilaaf jehar ugala he
 He says that Muslim society is involved in crime
 isliye ve unhen apane ghar main daakhil hone nahin dete hai or unase vot bhi nahin maangate hai
 They do not need the votes of the Meo society
 vaise bhi alvar main mev samaaj bijepi ko vot nahi detaa he
 Singhal said that Meo society has become successful in love jihad
 nakli naam kii fasebuk idi bana kar muslim ladke hindu ladakiyon ko fansaa kar unase shaadi kar unka jivan barbaad kar rahe hai, jabaki muslim samaaj kii anpadh or ashikshit ladkiyaan bhi hinduon se pyaar or shaadi nahin karti hai
 BJP MLA has said, i believe that if we look at the list or list of crimes in Alwar district, people of Muslim community will be found in it
 unhone kaha ki muslim samaaj kii anpadh ladki ko pataa he ki apane dharm ke mutabik unhen hindu ladke se pyaar or shaadi nahin kerani he, jabaki hindu samaaj kii pratibhashali, padhi likhi ladki dharm nirpeksh ho jaati he or mev samaaj ke ladakon se shaan se shaadi karti he
 After this, after two years, when the youth of the Meo society exploits them according to their habit and nature, then it is understandable
 singhl ne kaha ki muslim hindu samaaj ke logon kii gadiyon main maal bharke le jate hai or gadiyon ko bechakar aa jate hai
 The police keeps running after them
 jitne bhi prakaar ke aparaadh hai usamen muslim samaaj shaamil miltaa he
 MLA Singhal said, i do not go to ask votes from Meo Samaj, i also know that they do not vote for BJP in Alwar
 duusari baat yah ki jab main inase vot maangata hum to ye mujhe vot denge to inke aparaadhon par pardaa daalane kaa kaam karnaa padegaa jo main nahin karnaa chahta
 Let me tell you that Singhal has given controversial statements earlier too
 unhone kaha tha ki muslim samaaj ke dwaara 2030 tak puure desh ke shashan kii bagdor apane haathon main lene ke liye sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat muslimon kii aabaadi badhaai ja rahi he

 University Vice Chancellor Mohan Lal Chhipa says that values are declining in society, corruption is increasing, a depressing environment is being created, this situation should not affect the new generation so that it is necessary for them to remain in the womb of the mother Good education should be given before birth

 Good literature will be made available to women, there will be meaningful discussions among them, as well as they will be brought closer to good music

 According to the Vice Chancellor, this course will not be based on any religion, but women of all classes will succeed in making their children born and skilled and competent
 is paathyakram main geet-sangeet, chitrakala, kahani-kavita ke kareeb laane ke saath aisi filmein bhi dikhaai jaaengi jo unako prasann rakh saken or sanskaar dene vaali hon
 In Tapovan, experts from all fields will give guidance to women, as well as the husbands of pregnant women will also be linked to it

 ise dekhakar aapako film 'special 26' yaad na aa jaae, to kahiega
 
 
 Manappuram Gold Loan office in Nashik on 2 October 2013
 is vaqt daphtar main sab kuch normal he, bilkul kisi aam din kii tarah
 People are working at their respective places
 tabhi achaanak kuch pulisavaale ek naqaabposh mulzim ko lekar daftar main daakhil hote hai
 On seeing the police, the security guard posted at the office gate also retreats
 ab sabhi ke sabhi pulisavaale mulzim ko lekar daphtar ke andar daakhil ho chuke hai
 As soon as he comes, he declares that he has received the news that this vicious criminal is going to visit this office here
 lihaaza, yahaan kaam karanevaale sabhi logon se uski shinaakht karwaani behad zaruri he
 As soon as the policemen get the order, all the people working here come out of the counter to the front of the office
 isi bich ehtiyaat se kaam lete hue wo daftar ke security guard se bhi andar aakar daphtar kaa shater foran band kar lene ko kehete hai
 He obeys the policemen and does exactly as he is told
 tab tak pulisavaale us nakaabposh mulzim ko get ke paas hi ek kone par bithaae rakhte hai
 Now the police remove the mask from his face to identify Mulzim
 or bas, yaheen kuch aisa hota he ki yahaan maujuud tamaam logon ke hosh ud jate hai
 As soon as the mask is removed from the face, the accused stands in his place and takes out the pistol from his waist
 phir isse pehle ki gold lone ke daphtar main kaam karne vaale log kuch samaj pate, wo unki taraf pistal tanakar unhen apni-apni jagah par baith jane kaa hukum sunaata he
 Those who try to retreat a bit after seeing the gun, arrest the policemen with this charge and place them in one place and then the same is what can be expected
 
 
 kyonki ab ye saaf ho gaya tha ki police nakli he
 The crooks in the guise of the criminal and the police, first take the key of the locker at the point of arms from the office manager and then take out all the money and jewelry kept there
 cash or jevar kii kul keemat kareeb paanch karod thi
 On the lines of Akshay Kumar starrer film 'special 26' made on fake CBI officers, this robbery is seen as a spectacle along with all the guards working here as well as security guards
 ye badmaash na sirf daftar ke telephone ke tamaam taar kaat dete hai, balki sisitivi camaron ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Moreover, on the go, they lock the shutter of the office with the mobile phone of all the people and lock it from outside
 shaam takreeban chah baje daftar ke baahar se guzar rahe ek shaks ko jab daftar ke bahut jaldi band ho jane par shaq hota he, to pehle to wo shater ke baahar se andar kaa haal samajhane kii koshish karata he, phir shaq hone par police ko phone karata he
 The police, after receiving the news about four hours after the incident, arrive at the scene and free all the people imprisoned in the office
 baad main tafteesh chalati rahati he
 Nearly three months pass
 police bhi ummid chhod chuki hoti he
 But then something happens that as much as the drama was robbed, the matter is exposed in the same drama style
 thane main sadak ke kinare duty kar rahe ek pulisavaale ne achaanak ek ajeeb manzar dekha
 Suddenly a man jumped from a high speed car passing through the road and started running wildly
 yah dekhakar pulisavaale ke bhi kaan khadey ho gaye or usne foran us shaks kaa peechha karnaa shuru kar diya
 After a little effort, he was now under the grip of the police and the others in the car had fled
 lekin iske baad jab car se koode shaks se poochtacha shuru hui, to usne jo khulaasa kiya, usne sun kar pulisavaale bhi chaunk uthe
 This person said that he and his associates had carried out the robbery of Rs 5 crore in the Manappuram Gold Loan office on October 1, 2013
 lekin iske baad kuch aisa hua ki uske giroh main hi daraar pad gai
 The crook, who came under police control, said that after the robbery incident, money-sharing was also done, but the gang miscreants became suspicious about some things
 unhen lagane laga ki kahin wo is vaardaat kaa bhed jamaane ke saamne na khol de
 It was with this fear that his comrades started plotting to kill him
 iske baad jab gang ke baaki badmaash use pakadakar jaan se maarane ke iraade se apane kisi thikaane par le ja rahe the, wo apni jaan bachaane ke liye chalati gaadi se kud gaya tha
 However, as shocking as this man's disclosure was, the relief for the police was as much as the jump from his car was not only disclosed in the robbery incident just three months ago, but also a murder incident
 Averted
 baad main is giroh ke baaki badmaash bhi giraftaar kar liye gaye
