 'aaj Tak' will tell you the story of one such Karsevak who went to Ayodhya on both his legs but when he came back, he has been able to walk on the bed with the help of others and now for a lifetime and is forced to live anonymously
 ye kahani he us karsevak kii jisane ayodhya main ram mandir kii chaah main apana puraa jivan laga diya
 This is the story of a Karsevak named Achal Singh Meena who was injured on 6 December 1992 while demolishing the disputed structure in Ayodhya that he can no longer leave for life without the help of others

 On 6 December, during the Babri demolition, debris of a part of the dome fell on Achal's back and the entire part below the waist stopped working
 ab achal 56 saal ke hai
 On asking, we say that 'we climbed the dome on 6 December and when the dome fell, i too fell with it
 mere sir or haath-pair main chot lagi or qamar chali gai
 i was first admitted in Faizabad and then taken to Gandhi Medical College Lucknow where i was conscious
 tab se main chal nahin saktaa, ghar main hi padaa rahata hum isi tarah'
 The leaders did not take the news
 It is said that since 1992 many leaders came to Bhopal, but no one took good news of it
 achal apane sir par lagi chot dikhaate hai or din ke har pahar isi tarah jameen par pade rahete hai
 Stable, he could not control his emotions and cried bitterly
 rote hue achalane kaha ki 'bhagwaan bataate hai ki jise jitna dukh miltaa he usko bhagwaan hi sahyog karata he ye baat satya he
 No leader can say that even a glass of water has to be given, but i believe in the name of Rama that he will fulfill it

 usamen unka jivan safal hoga nahin to keval gaddi ke liye agar wo bane hai to bhavishya main ye mauka unhen kabhi nahin milegaa'
 If luck is there, i will go to Ayodhya again
 Achal Singh hopes that the Ram temple will be built

 in donon tiimon main ek baat haalanki aam rahi he or wo chintaa kaa vishay bhi he
 The batting of both the teams is weak and this is the reason why there is no balance in the team
 gendbaajon ne ballebaajon kii apeksha kaaphi acha kiya he, lekin kai maukon par vah bhi niraashaa dekar gaye hai
 Looking at South Africa, his batting has so far revolved around Quinton de Kock and captain Faf du Plessis
 hashim amala ne newjiland ke khilaaf khele gaye pichley match main ardhashatak jarur banaaya tha, lekin sawaal yah he ki kya amala apane form ko jari rakh pate hai yaa nahin
 Lungi Nagidi's return to bowling has strengthened South Africa
 nagidi ne newjiland ke khilaaf aakhri overon main ahm wicket le romaanch laa diya tha
 However, he could not win the team
 dakshin africa ko baaki ke maichon ko lekar satark rahanaa hoga kyonki ab har match main jeet hi uske liye semifinal ke raste khol sakati he
 And with that thrilling win, New Zealand go atop the # cwc19standings! # backtheblackcaps | # wivnz | # cwc19pic

 Pakistan have given an extra 30-40 runs in every match on average and their batsmen have not been able to make up for it
 imam ul haq or fakhar jamaan ko dakshin africa ke nagidi or cagiso rabada ke saamne acchhee shuruyaat deni hogi, to vahiin mohammad hafeez, shoeb malik, babar ajam, sarfaraj ahamed ko imran taahir kii phiraki ke alaava kris morris, andile fehalukvayo se nipatna hoga

 This benefit was to be done through demonetisation bhrashtachar par lagaamdesh main 500 or 1000 rupee kii pratibandhit karency kul karency kii 85 fisadi thi
 This currency was also an apparel of corruption in the country
 notebandi ke faisle ke baad se hi bhrashtachar ke liye is karency kaa istemaal ruk gaya he
 The new currency was issued instead of the old currency and the government gradually and with the help of all the security parameters operated in the market so that black money would not be collected in the economy again
 2
 To create a cashless economy economy, it was necessary that more and more transactions in the country should be done through digital mediums
 isse karency par desh kii nirbharta kam hogi or rigerv bank or anya baikon ke saath-saath kendra sarkaar ko karency sanchaalan main kam kharch karnaa padegaa
 The cashless economy will benefit the government as well as the common man, as his money will be more secure in digital exchanges
 3
 The imposition of fake currency was a serious problem of flow of fake currency from across the border
 nakli karency jiske haath pahunchati thi use utane mulya kaa turant nuksaan uthaanaa padataa tha
 At the same time, the government also had to resort to large networks for its prevention
 karency kaa kam istemaal (digital pement) or bade dinomination kii karency se ek jatke main desh se nakli karency saaf ho chuki he
 Therefore, it was expected that with the new security standard being strengthened, the economy would be protected from fake currency for the next several years
 ise padhein: notebandi se GDP ko aise hua bada nuksaan, vishwa bank ne satellite image se kiya khulaasa4
 The real estate sector will be the biggest gainer in the real estate sector after transparency
 beete kai dashakon se real estate sector kaledhan ke nivesh kaa sabase bada jariya tha
 Due to this, it was common for the paper to have a big difference between the purchase of property and the actual purchase
 isse jahaan sarkaar ko stamp duty main bada nuksaan hota tha vahiin aam aadmi ko blikemani na hone ke chalate makaan kharidne main dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 5
 khatm hoga kaladhansarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki notebandi ke faisle se kaledhan ke khilaaf saamaajik badlaav laane ke kaam ko aasaani se kiya ja sakegaa
 It is a fact that black money cannot be eliminated from any economy until it is boycotted at the social level
 abhi tak kaledhan kaa nivesh property or sona-chaandi main kiya jaataa tha jisase inaki keemat vaastavik keemat se hameshaa adhik bani rahati thi
 Therefore, the use of black money in these areas was expected to be banned after demonetisation
 6
 Parallel Economy will be closed with the help of money and corruption, there was always a parallel economy in the country
 desh main koyala kii khaadaan se lekar sadak kinare chaay or sabji bechney vaale is samanaantar arthvyavastha main shaamil rahete the
 Most people here used to carry out their economic activities, damaging the country's gross domestic income
 lihaaja, notebandi se digital pement kii ore rujhaan or notebandi se khatm hue kaledhan kaledhan ke saath-saath is samanaantar iconomi ko mukhyadhara main jodne main madad milane kii ummid thi
 7
 badhegaa tex besadesh main digital pement ko badhaava dene kaa sabase bada phayda hoga ki bade se bade or chote se chote tranjaction bainkon ke paas darj honge
 The Income Tax Department will also be constantly monitoring these transactions
 jab desh main blike iconomi kaa aadhaar nahin rahegaa to jaahir he zyada se zyada log tex kaa bhugtan karne ke baad hi apni kharid-farokht ko puraa kar paaenge
 Hence, demonetisation was expected to increase the revenue of central and state governments rapidly, reduce its financial deficit and will have sufficient resources to improve the country's infrastructure
 8
 Financial savings will be increased Before the ban, people in the country used to invest their savings in property, gold and jewelery
 jarurat padane par log ise blakemarket main bechakar ek baar phir karency main badal lete the
 Before demonetisation, more than 50 percent of the country's families used to save their savings in these ways
 yahaan nivesh hua adhikansh paisa sambhavit blikemani bhi thi
 So it was expected that after demonetisation, real estate and gold would not be able to give the expected returns and common people would once again turn to banks to keep their savings instead of investing in these mediums
 ummid thi ki log seaving bank, demand draft or mutual fund jaise vikalpon kaa adhik sahaara lenge or yahaan inhen sabase surakshit ritern bhi milegaa
 9
 badhegi bainkon kii kamainotbandi se kaledhan par lagaam ke saath-saath teji se badhate digital pement se notebandi ke baad bainkon kii kamai main bada ijapha dekhne kii ummid bandhi thi
 It was believed that with this increase, banks will expand and clear the way for easy and cheap banking to attract customers
 iske saath hi yah bhi ummid lagaai gai ki notebandi se bainkon ke paas ekatrit hui daulat unhen unka ghaataa paatane main bhi madad karegi
 10 will be cheaper Since the benefits of Curzonotbandi, the benefit to the banks is going to have a direct impact on the interest rates in the country
 ummid thi ki vittiya jagat main paardarshita ke saath-saath bank apana kaarobaar failaane ke liye zyada se zyada karj dene kii koshish karenge
 At the same time, to lure customers, he can announce a big cut in the interest rates on the loan
 isse desh main ghar kharidne, car yaa scooter kharidne athwa kaarobaar ke liye karj saste daron main milanaa shuru ho jaaenge
 These 5 losses due to demonetisation? 1

 ghat gai aam aadmi kii seaving Ramon Magsaysay Award winner Sanjeev Chaturvedi has slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone pradhanmantri daftar (piemo) par aarope lagaaya he ki usne haryana or ames main unke bhrashtachar virdohi abhiyaan main saath nahin diya
 Sanjeev Chaturvedi, a 2002 batch officer from Haryana, is known for exposing a number of corruption cases in AIIMS and there was a big controversy last year when he was removed from AIIMS KCVO post
 iske liye modi sarkaar ke swasthya mantri jepi nadda par aarope lagaae gaye the
 'I took Modi's slogan in the same way', he said, 'when i was fighting the war against corruption in Haryana and AIIMS, all kinds of false things were spread against me

 The Magsaysay Foundation on Wednesday announced the 2015 Magsaysay Award to Chaturvedi and social worker Anshu Gupta
 iske baad chaturvedi ne ek tivi channel se kaha, 'piemo ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jang main saath nahin diya
 Chaturvedi, who has been an AIIMS vigilance officer, said, 'the intolerant attitude should be against corruption and not against honest officials

 Politics has started on the issue of increasing the existing assembly seats in Jharkhand
 desh ke do mukhya rajnatik dal ab ise lekar ek-duusare par aarope pratyarope laga rahe hai
 Recently in Ranchi, Union Minister Jairam Ramesh said that he has written a letter to the Union Home Minister to increase the assembly seats here
 ramesh bole ki main jald hi is silsile main grih mantri se milane vaala hum
 He said that in the form of accusing the opposition party BJP that at the time of state formation there was NDA government at the center and at that time the subject was not carefully addressed
 gauratlab he ki duusare pradeshon kii tulana main aaj bhi jharkhand main siton kii sankhya aabaadi ke anupaat main kam he or yahi yahaan kii raajnneetik asthirataa kaa ek mukhya kaaran he
 On Ramesh's allegations, former Jharkhand Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Arjun Munda said that during my tenure all the mlas of the state had unanimously sent a proposal to the Union Cabinet, which asked to increase the seats
 magar upie sarkaar ne us par dhyaan nahin diya
 Munda said that instead of writing a letter to Jairam Ramesh, this proposal should be raised in the cabinet meeting
 jharkhand kii vidhansabha main philhal 81 siten hai, jo aabaadi ke lihaaj se kaaphi kam he or ab ise badhaakar 125-130 karne kii kavayad chal rahi he
 The ruling Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi has targeted the central government for the terrorist attack in Pathankot
 endie sarkaar kii videsh niti par sawaal uthaane ke saath hi party ne suraksha balon ke 80 ghante se adhik samay tak chale oparation par sawaal uthaae hai
 On the lines of the Congress, Ashutosh and Sanjay Singh from the AAP on Tuesday sought answers to questions from the central government
 'aap' netaa ashutosh nepress conferenceke dauraan kaha, 'pradhanmantri ek taraf shaadi kii badhai dete hai or duusari taraf 80 ghante tak karrwai chalane kii khabar aa rahi he
 Many serious questions are being raised about this
 bijepi or centre sarkaar ko yah spasht karnaa chahie ki aakhir uski videsh niti kya he?'pakistan ke saath rishton kii nai ibaarat ko lekar ashutosh ne kaha ki pradhanmantri modi pakistan ke lahore main navaj sharif se gale milte hai, yah sabhi ne dekha, lekindonon ke bich kya baatcheet huiyah nahin bataaya gaya
 He said, 'now a terrorist attack has taken place in Pathankot
 pradhanmantri ko yah spasht karnaa chahie ki islamabad main videsh sachiv str kii baatcheet hogi yaa nahin
 'did PM Ashutosh go to Lahore under the pressure of America, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi suddenly reaches Lahore
 vah vahaan gale milte hai, khaanaa khate hai
 Was there any pressure, was there any compulsion behind it
 'aap' netaa ne kaha, 'kya baraak obama kaa phone aayaa tha? kya america ke dawaab main pakistan kii raajnneeti ho rahi he?'punjab main vidhansabha chunaav par najar tikaae aam aadmi party ne kaha ki sarkaar bataae ki kya aatankwaadiyon ke bich koi samjhauta hua? ashutosh ne poocha, 'desh kii videsh niti koun chalaa rahaa he? kya ajit dobhaal videsh niti chalaa rahe hai? hamen yah samaj nahin aata ki centre kii videsh niti kya he
 It was said that during the press conference, party leader Sankhaj Singh attacked the Prime Minister, saying, 'narendra Modi used to say that instead of 1, 10 will be brought
 lekin vah achaanak udyogpatiyon ke ishaare par pakistan jate hai
 We oppose it
 yah desh ko gumraah karne kii koshish he
 Pakistan sponsored terrorism should stop in the country
 'is dauraan aam aadmi party ne narendra modi kii sarkaar se 5 sawaalon ke jawaab bhi maange-1) pradhanmantri bataaen ki lahore main kya charchaa hui?2) NSA level kii baatcheet ke baad videsh sachiv str kii baatcheet ke bare main kyon soch rahe hai?3) grahamantri ne kaha tha ki pathankoth main oparation khatm, lekin kya vajah thi ki bayaan badalanaa padaa?4) ajit dobhaal kaa kya role he, videsh niti koun chalaa rahaa he, spasht karen?5) kya drug smagaller or aatankwaad main sambandh hai?

 ' The BJP has termed the laughter of senior ministers of the state Ajay Chandrakar and Brijmohan Agrawal in a tribute meeting organized in Chhattisgarh's capital Raipur on former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee's ashes of the urn
 darasal, soshal media par ek aisa video viral ho rahaa he, jisamen rajya ke do mantri us samay tahaakaa lagaate najar aa rahe hai, jab purv pradhanmantri vaajapeyi kii asthi kalash yatra nikaali ja rahi thi
 After concluding the bone immersion program, the party admitted that it was a human error and for this the state party president has explained to the two ministers
 bijepi pravaktaa sanjay shrivastav ne guuruuvaar shaam ko is bare main party kaa paksh rakhaa
 He said that sometimes such human error happens
 haalanki party str par donon hi mantriyon ko iske liye samajhaayaa bhi gaya he
 Sanjay Srivastava also said that the Congress was making a mistake about this human error
 isse saaf he ki wo piem vaajapeyi ke nidhan ko bhi raajnneetik rup dene main juty hui he
 Let me tell you that on Thursday, a meeting was organized in Pandals in Raipur, paying tribute to Vajpayee's ashes
 isi dauraan ek kaarykram main stage par maujuud do mantri panchayat va gramin vikaas mantri ajay chandrakar or krishi mantri brijmohan agarwal tahaakaa lagaate najar aae
 It is being told that these two ministers were laughing at a clip on mobile
 maamle main jab donon mantriyon se pratikriya lene kii koshish kii gai, to unhone chuppi saadh lee
 At the same time, the Congress has attacked the BJP for the laughter of these ministers
 congress ne kaha ki vahpurv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyika aadar karti he, lekin khud bijepi ke logon ko unke nidhan se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 This is the reason why BJP ministers are celebrating their death rather than expressing grief
 congress pravaktaa shailesh nitin trivedi ne bijepi ke netaaon ke is karname ko sharmnaak qaraar diya he
 He said that the Kalash Yatra of Vajpayee has been made a matter of fun by the BJP
 udhar, viral video ke jor pakadaney ke baad atal bihari vaajapeyi kii bhatiji karunaa shukla bhi maidan main kud gai hai
 He has demanded both the ministers to show their way out of the cabinet
 unhone bhi aarope lagaaya ki purv pradhanmantri kii kalash yatra nikaalkar bijepi chunavi phayda lene main juty hui he
 Through this, the BJP wants to hide the failures of its governments and create its government again in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh by creating Vajpayee's support wave

 mahabharat or ramayana ke baad 90 ke dashak main tipu sultan ke serial ne jabardast lokapriyata hasil kii thi
 Born on 20 November, Tipu Sultan was brought to life by actor Sanjay Khan
 is serial kaa naam 'da sord of tipu sultan' tha
 The show went on air on DD National in 1990
 ye lekhak bhagwaan gidwani ke noval par aadhaarit tha
 It was only after watching this show that people became deeply aware of Tipu Sultan
 baad main is serial ko bengali or tamil main bhi dab kiya gaya tha
 The shooting of this serial was done in Mysore
 iske kul 60 episod prasaarit kiye gaye the
 Tipu Sultan ruled Mysore in the 18th century
 haalanki sho ko lekar kai logon kii alag-alag raay he
 Many people are of the opinion that while Tipu Sultan worked to improve the economy in the 18th century, Mysore was economically powerful during that period
 iske alaava unhone apane samrajya ke liye kaaphi kaam bhi kiya
 The other side is that Kitipusultan forcibly converted many people
 unhone duusare dharm ke logon ko maravaaya
 They also attacked churches and temples
 aise main tipu sultan kaaphi vivaadaaspad shakhsiyat rahe hai
 There has been a demand to censor the content of Netflix and Amazon Prime in the era of social media where people are giving opinions on every issue and in a time when the films related to pseudo nationalism are dominated in the industry, where few of the film Due to the disputed political or period drama tone, the demand for banning these films and dramas starts increasing
 netflixor amejon prime jaise plateforms ke content ko sensor karne kii maang lagaataar uthati rahi he
 Recently, an episode of an American show on Amazon Prime was also removed because the episode mentioned a lot of bitter things related to the current government
 aise daur main tipu sultan jaisi vivaadit hasti par film yaa serial bananaa kisi bhi filmkaar ke liye behad chunauteepurn sabit ho saktaa he
 All kinds of civil liberties have come from the Constitution in India
 khaskar samvidhan ke anuchhed 14, 19, 21 or 25 nagarikon ke moolbhoot adhikaron kii sthapana karte hai or adaalatein puri gambhirtha se inaki rakhwali karti hai
 When Hindustan gained its independence in the backdrop of the partition, the merger of princely states, the conflict over Kashmir and the separatist movement in Nagaland, the government was not ready for all of this
 aisi sthiti se nipatane ke liye na to jaruri sansthaaen thim or na hi prashikshit maanavbal tha
 The administrative set-up was sluggish in dealing with the unfolding incidents and in many cases was left burdened by the incidents
 centre sarkaar ke saamne praathmik kaam bhartiya sangh kii akhandta ko kaayam rakhana tha or duusari harek cheez kii ahmiyat uske baad aati thi
 This was the primary reason that in the early 1950s, the Indian Army was deployed to Nagaland in a hurry
 sena ko ek aise bhubhag main tainaat kiya gaya tha jo anjaan tha or kai maamle main vah pratirodhi gaanvon ko aage ke hawaale karne or naagarik aabaadi ke khilaaf atyaacharon main shaamil thi
 The geographical area full of forests was vast and at that time the army fought as if fighting the enemy
 use ehsaas hi nahin tha ki ve apane hi log hai
 In those early years, the solution of the political leadership issue was left to the army
 vah naakaam isliye rahaa kyonki naadaani ke chalate yaa jaan-boojhkar usne is mudde ko kanoon or vyavastha kaa maamla mana, na ki aisa mudda jiske siyaasi samaadhaan kii jarurat thi or halaat ko kaabo karne ke liye gahare rajnatik soch-vichaar ke baad kadam uthaae jane chahie the
 It was also a remote area and at that time there was such a condition of means of communication that the rest of India and the world did not know directly what was happening in Nagaland
 aisi hi sthiti 1960 or 1970 ke dashakon main bhi paidaa hui jab mizoram, manipur, tripura or assam main baghawat foot padi
 Creating fresh village clusters and using the Indian Air Force to bombard Aizawl to deflect pressure from the Assam Rifles forces were policy options that have not been available to the government in such an uncontrolled manner during the last two or three decades 
 ab hamaare saamne ek aisi sthiti he jisamen 2017-18 main supreme court ne manipur main 1979 or may 2012 ke bich kathith gaiyr-nyaayik hatyaon yaa muthbhedon ke 1,528 maamalon kii jaanch kaa faisla liya he
 The Supreme Court has clearly stated that the rule of law will apply even when dealing with "enemies"
 yah sab achaanak nahin hua, balki sheersh adaalat ke kai faislon ke natijatan yah mukaam aayaa he
 D
 ke
 Justifying the Basu decision and the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), the court's comments on what to do and what not to follow said that the basic right to life and equality of law, any such obligations of the government Are more important
 yah majbootee se kaha gaya he or doharaaya gaya he ki kanoon kaa shashan sarkaar kii vaidhata ke mul main he or maanav suraksha kii purvashart he
 From the perspective of the security forces and the security establishment, this was seen as another obstacle or obstacle that the security forces had to face while dealing with the rebellion
 yah bhi mahasoos kiya gaya tha ki adaalaton or civil sosayadi ko jamini hakeekat or halaat kii koi sachhee samaj nahin he jinamein suraksha balon ko pratikul bhubhag main dushmani par utaaru aabaadi kaa saamana karte hue kaam karnaa padataa he
 The atrocities of the rebels and violations of civil liberties were often ignored
 suraksha bal in vidrohon se simit sansadhano ke saath lard rahe the or unka ek haath maano bandhaa hua tha
 Punjab is a unique example where once the entire lower judiciary was seen with the militants
 vahaan baar-baar aisi ghatnaayen hoti thim jinamein dehshatgardon ko girakrataar kiya jaataa tha, unhen remand ke liye adaalaton main laayaa jaataa tha or unhen fouran jamaanat par chhod diya jaataa tha
 In many cases, when the arrested militants were brought to court, their bail orders were kept ready in advance
 natijatan, aisi sthiti se bachane ke liye muthbhedon kii anadhikarik manjuuri mil gai
 i am not saying that excesses did not happen at the hands of the security forces, but their compulsions were never understood by the civil society and the judiciary
 punjab main jab ugravad shikhar par tha, tab aisa bartaav karne vaale kisi bhi nyaayik adhikari ko usase upar ke adhikariyon ne kabhi aade haathon nahin liya
 On the other hand, when the insurgency was overcome successfully, the policemen faced charges and were sent to jail
 yah sarkaar kii baari naakaami thi ki usne un logon ko kshamaadaan nahin diya jinhone desh kii akhandta ko mahfuj rakhane ke liye apni jaan kii baaji laga di thi
 An important script that comes back again and again to the basic reasons hidden at the root of the rebellion has been the government's failure to deal with the political issues contained therein
 kuch maamalon main to shashan hi naakaam rahaa, jiskaa nateeja yah hua ki inamen se kai ugravadi / vidrohi andolan samaadhaan ke bagaiyr dashakon ghistate rahe
 The political class pushed forward the armed forces and state police forces and held them responsible for their failure to resolve the issue
 "nattejey'' dene ke dabaav main suraksha balon ne halaat par kaabo paane ke liye kai upayon kaa sahaara liya
 These included using surrendered militants to deal with rebel factions
 assam main sarender kar chuke sulpha (esaulefee) or kashmir main ikhwaan ke maamle isaki pramukh misaalen hai
 Salwa Judum may be another example
 jab chauthi peedi kii jang 21veen sadi main apane pair failaa rahi he, tab suraksha balon kii chunautiyaan or bhi bad gai hai
 Especially at a time when vigilant civil society and social media are in such a situation that any wrong move by the security forces can go viral on sight
 civil sosayadi main ugravadi dhadon ke samarthak hai jo unke vichaaron ke saath-saath unke kaamon kaa bhi prachaar-prasar karte hai or unke khilaaf suraksha balon kii kisi bhi karrwai main adenge daalate hai
 Today, there is a growing realization among the security establishment as well as the security forces that violation of human rights and rule of law can lead to adverse consequences in the long run
 in dinon prashikshan academiyon main is pahalu par khaasaa jor diya ja rahaa he
 This is not enough
 hamaari prashikshan suvidhaon ko unnat banane kii jarurat he or is baat kii bhi ki kanoon par amal kii baat har surakshakarmi ke man main gaharaai se baitha di jaae
 But for this a much larger reform is needed and that is reform of criminal judicial system
 isamen nyaaypalika kii kahin zyada badi bhoomika he
 This is still a major weakness of the system
 siyaasi tabake ko in sudhaaron ko bade paimaane par lagu karnaa hoga or yah pakkaa karnaa hoga ki kanoon kaa shashan sarkaar ke har kaarykram ke centre main ho
 Till then, vigilant civil society and active judiciary must ensure that all forms of civil liberties are safe in the country

 taj nahin, jute nahin
 And not all the other things that we have to show or give to the world
 khushi ke us khaas pal main aisi sari baaten peeche rah gayi, jab obama ne apni tuuti-phooti hindi main kaha, “senorita
 
 
 Such small things keep happening in big countries
 
 
 ”kuch hi minuton main shahrukh ke phens ne itane twit kar daale ki ‘esaaarake pride of india’ trend karne laga
 There was a debate on social media that Obama took the name of the person with whom Shahrukh misbehaved with the American airport officials
 usee shaks ke dialaag ke saath apni baaten khatm kii
 Modi in his farewell tweet to Obama 'in big countries
 
 
 ’ kii baat to shahrukh ne bhi usee andaaj main aabhaar jataayaa, 'obama ke bhaashan kaa hissaa bana iskaa mujhe garv he
 Disappointed to hear that he could not do Bhangra, but next time he will be sure of 'chaiya-chaiya'
 ' vaise senorita obama ke shahrukh prem kaa aakhri shot nahin tha
 In his speech, Obama also mentioned Shahrukh in mentioning religion and diversity in India
 obama ne kaha ki bharat tab tak kaamyaab rahegaa jab tak vah dharmik aadhaar par vibhajit nahin hoga or apni aasthaa se itar log shahrukh jaise actor kii filmein dekhte rahenge or taaliyaan bajaate rahenge, thik vaise hi jaise milkha singh yaa meri com ke naam par ve utsav manaate hai
 The most special thing in this entire episode was the mention of Shahrukh Khan in Obama's speech

 He was brought out of the interrogation room after the Indian government intervened
 baad main yel university main apane bhaashan main shahrukh ne ghatana kaa majaak udaate hue kaha, 'jab bhi mujhe khud pe gurur hone lagata he, main america jaataa hum
 The immigration people threw my stardom away
 ve hameshaa mujhase meri lambaai poochhate hai or har baar main bataata hum ki main 5 feet 10 inch hum

 'isse pehle 2009 main bhi new jersey ke nevark liberty international airport par shahrukh ko roak kar kai ghante poochtacha kii gai
 Shah Rukh then went on to promote his film 'my Name is Khan', which shows how a man named Khan grapples with the situation after the 9 / 11 attacks
 mumkin he, ab america airport par poochtacha ke naam par adhikari vaise pesh nahin aaenge yaa unhen roka nahin jayega
 In such a situation, looking at Senorita's eyes, Shah Rukh who would say, we also know, "such small things keep happening in big countries

 While praising Hardik Pandya's hard work, dedication to work and confidence in the discussion due to controversies for some time, his elder brother Krunal Pandya said that cricket was always his younger brother's priority
 hardik ko ek tivi kaarykram ke dauraan mahilaon par aapattijanak tippanee karne ke liye nilamban jhelana padaa tha
 Apart from this, he was also ruled out due to a back injury, but the all-rounder has returned to his full rhythm before the World Cup and Krunal attributed this to 'constantly working on his game while off the field'
 krunal ne mumbai indiens kii dilli capitals ke khilaaf ipel match main 40 ranon se jeet ke baad kaha, 'hardik chot or jo masalaa (vivaad) hua tha, us vajah se jab saat-aath maheene baahar rahaa to usne tab apni fitness par bahut kaam kiya
 i have played cricket with Hardik since childhood and he is the kind of player whose cricket has always been a priority in his life
 kaam ke prati us jaisaa samarpan maine bahut kam khilaadiyon main dekha he
 He works extremely hard
 'aaj KKR se kohli kii RCB kaa muqabla, haare to IPL se bahraunhone kaha ki chot or vivaad ke baavjood hardik hataash nahin hua or lagaataar apane khel par kaam karata rahaa
 Krunal said, 'always his or our aim is to improve our game because continuous improvement brings consistency in your game
 isliye jab vah maidan se baahar rahaa to usne is dauraan apane khel par kaam kiya or aaj use iskaa parinaam mil rahaa he
 "I feel the best thing about Hardik is that he never gives up and when it comes to cricket, he is completely devoted to it," said Krunal
 jab vah 14-15 saal kaa tha tab se uski praathamikta keval cricket rahi he
 'krunal said that he learns a lot from Hardik, who is three years younger than him, because he always sees the positive side of anything
 unhone kaha, 'agar aap dekho to usne har saal apane khel main nai cheez jodi he
 He is full of confidence
 maine usase kaaphi kuch siikhaa he
 i have learned from him how to motivate myself in any kind of trouble
 vah hameshaa chizon ke sakaaratmak paksh par gaur karata he
 He does not doubt himself
 yah uskaa ek vishesh gun he
 This favor of Dhoni made Kohli the star, telling himself the whole story against the Kadadilly capitals
 The two Pandya brothers shared fast runs in the final overs and shared 54 runs for the fifth wicket which ultimately proved decisive
 hardik ne 15 gendon main 32 ran banaae, jisase mumbai paanch wicket par 168 ran banane main safal rahaa
 History may be against him, but Pakistan coach Waqar Younis said that it is time to re-create history as the Indian team is under pressure since losing the first match in World T20 cricket
 pakistan ne isisi world cap main bhi kabhi bharat ko nahin haraaya
 India beat him six times in One Day World Cup and four times in World T20
 younus ne shanivaar ko hone vaalebharat-pakistan mahamukablese pehle kaha, ‘isamen koi shaq nahin ki itihaas hamaare paksh main nahin he lekin ham ise badal nahin sakate
 History also changes

 pehali baar bharat adhik dabaav main he
 This is a big tournament
 main itane saal cricketer rahaa hum or mujhe nahin lagata ki in halaat main koi team aisi hogi jo dabaav main nahin hogi
 I'm sure they must have felt the pressure
 ’vakaar ne kaha ki bangladesh ke khilaaf pehle match main jeet ke saath aagaaj se unki team ko badhat mil gai he
 He said, 'I have got this benefit
 isse bharat par atirikt dabaav ban gaya he

 He said, 'it should be taken like a game
 hamaari pratidwandvita kaa khel ke maidan par itihaas rahaa he
 Shahid Afridi scored 49 runs in just 19 balls against Bangladesh and also took two wickets

 It was decided in the meeting that the CBSE Board will release the result as per the result moderation policy
 sunwaayee ke dauraan haalanki hai court ne yah kaha tha ki is niti ko agle saal se lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 The result of Bihar Board Class 12 commerce can be released today, see here was the whole matter
 Actually, this whole matter is of Grace Marks

 is hafte relies hui he anant narayan mahadevan kii film 'da expos' jiskaa nirmaan kiya he, vipin reshmia ne
 The film stars Himesh Reshammiya, Honey Singh, Zoya Afroz, Sonali Raut, Jessie Randhawa, Nakul Vaidya and guest starring Irrfan Khan
 film kii kahani 60 ke dashak kii film industry par aadhaarit he, jahaan superstar ravi kumaar yani himesh reshmia dakshin kii filmon se hindi filmon main kadam rakhte hai, diarector subba prasad yani anant narayan mahadevan kii film ’sheethal nirmal ujjwal’ se
 On the other side is director Chadha's film 'reena Mera Naam'
 jab yah film relies hoti he tab party ke din ek haadasa hota he, jisamen ek heroin kii maut ho jaati he
 Who is responsible for this death, how it opens layer by layer and how it settles
 yah jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Now it is necessary to tell you how i liked the film
 film kii shuruyaat main hi bataaya jaataa he ki yah film sachhee ghatnaon par aadhaarit he, jisaki vajah se darshak cinema ke itihaas main film ke kirdaaron ko dhundne kii koshish karte hai or khaskar mere jaise log, jo filmi duniya kii dher sari kahaniyon se vaakif hai, ve shaayad puri film main itihaas tatolane main hi lage rahenge
 Secondly, the dialogue of the film will entertain you
 film ke sangeet main 60 or 70 ke dashak kaa masala he, phir chaahe vah gane hon yaa becoground score, jo mujhe bahut pasand aayaa
 Now-a-days, there are very few background scores in films that settle in your mind and are forced to hum, the same happened in 'the Expose'
 film kii mukhya bhoomika main najar aa rahe himesh reshmia kaa kirdaar mashuhar abhinayta rajkumaar se prerit najar aata he or film main unka kirdaar achche dhang se gadha kiya gaya he
 Also, i have no hesitation in saying that Himesh has played his character well
 bataur actor himesh main nikhaar najar aayaa
 Yes, i don't like the action scenes
 hani singh ek-do seen main apana asar chhodte hai
 Irfan Khan's work looked as good as it looked
 film ke gane mujhe madhur lage par kuch gaanon ke bol bhi agar 60 ke dashak kii tarah hote to behatar hota
 In some places, the director did not take care of the decade in the costume and dance, which is the story of this decade
 film kii kahani badi sidhi or choti-si he isliye pehle bhaag main thodi rukaawat mahasoos hoti he
 However, the film's edit screenplay and style of telling the story will keep you connected to the film
 to kul milakar ’da expoj’ ek manoranjan se bharpoor film he, jahaan aapako 70 ke dashak ke cinema kii tarah larger dain life kirdaar ghatnaayen or dialog baaji milegi

 The deadline for depositing illegal notes in banks has expired on December 30
 ab sirf bhartiya rigerv bank (RBI) main hi aise note jamaa kiye ja sakate hai
 In Delhi too, those who deposit old notes outside the RBI can be seen converging
 duusare rajyon se bhi log isi uddeshy se aa rahe hai
 But everyone was disappointed
 dilli yaa aasapaas ke rajyon se jo log avaidh note arabiai main jamaa karaane ke iraade se aa rahe hai, jab unase poocha gaya ki unhone 30 disambar tak inhen bainkon main jamaa kyon nahin kiya to alag-alag vajahen bataayin
 Some reasons are very bizarre
 1- pati sharaab pi jaataek hajaar rupee badalawaane ai dilli kii ek mahila ne bataaya- 'main biimaar thi, pati ko badalawaane ke liye detii to wo sharaab pi jaataa, isliye khud ai
 'her husband who came with the woman said-' Now we will frame this note of one thousand and see who has to vote
 '2- note chuuhe kutar gaenoida ke rahul ne bataaya- do nae do-do hajaar ke note bhagwaan par chadaaye the, chuuhe donon note uthaa le gaye
 If we met yesterday, now these crooked notes have not been changed in RBI
 3- baari padaa 786 number vaale noton kaa collectionoton kii siries main aakhir main 786 number ke noton ke collection kaa shaukeen ek yuvak bhi pareshaan dikhaai diya
 He said - 'I was collecting notes with number 786 for many years, at first i would not change my mind
 jab pataa chalaa ki puraane note rakhane par sarkaar karrwai bhi kar sakati he to yahaan chalaa aayaa
 '4- Why did not change at the airport itself? Kamran, who lives in Notalkhanu, was in Saudi Arabia for the last one year
 ab jab arabiai main note badalane aae to manaa kar diya gaya
 According to Kamran, he was told that he should have changed at the airport itself
 '5- bachche ke shagun ke note gullak se niklefatehpur upi se ek shaks 4000 rupee lekar arabiai pahunche
 On the birth of their child, Nana Nani gave these rupees in the form of Shagun, till now he was in Gullak
 ab nikle to yahaan lekar aa gaye lekin niraashaa hi haath lagi
 6- Could not collect due to the demise of the mother, there was also a person who had brought the death certificate of the mother
 uskaa kahana tha ki maa ke nidhan kii vajah se wo puraane note nahin jamaa kar sakaa
 7- The torn notes were asked to be changed later
 Another person said that he was told that the torn notes would be replaced later, so now he brought them
 8- dimag kaam nahin kar rahaa, MRI saath laayaa hunek or vyakti kaa kahana tha- 'main biimaar hum dhai saal se, emarai bhi laayaa hum
 The brain is not working eksre bhi hai
 Still ill '9- patni ne sweateron main chhupaae hue the, ab dhakke kha rahe hanek shaks ne kaha- 'patni ne sweateron main 12,000 rupye chupa kar rakhe hue the
 Now they are eating '10-mummy rakh kar bhul gai thimnote jamaa karaane ke iraade se aae yuvak ne kaha- 'mummy ke paas paise the, lekin wo inhen bhul gai thim

 Former Chief Minister ND Tiwari, wife Dr
 ujjwala tiwari or putr rohit shekhar tiwari ko apana uttaradhikari ghoshit kiya he
 Accusing his former OSD Bhawani Bhatt of cheating, ND said that in the past he had given his heir or successor status through a will or any record, all of them have been revoked with immediate effect
 mal avenue sthit apane sarkari awaas par endi tiwari ne kaha ki yadi kisi nijee, trust, sansthaanon yaa sansthaaon main unka naam sangrakshak, prerak yaa kisi anya pad par bina unki sweekruti ke upyog kiya ja rahaa he to usko bhi nishprabhavi samajha jaae
 Dr
 ujjwala tiwari ne purv oesady bhavani bhatta par endi tiwari kaa istemaal kar dhaandhlee kaa aarope lagaaya
 Dr
 tiwari ne aarope lagaate hue kaha, 'bhavani bhatta ne apni sanstha ko aarthik laabh pahunchane ke liye endi tiwari kaa upyog kiya
 He did not want ND Tiwari to meet me and my son
 november 2013 main endi tiwari kaa live certificate bhi jamaa nahin kiya gaya
 This stopped his pension
 mal avenue vaale sarkari bangale ko bhavani bhatta ne kisi trust ke naam kara liya ho isaki bhi sambhaavna he
 The electricity bill of this bungalow is Rs 70 thousand
 bhavani bhatta ne endi tiwari ke farji hastakshar kaa bhi istemaal kiya, yah maamla uttarakhand main police ne pakadaa he

 ye degree unhen desh ke kisi bhi college main assistant professor kii naukari dilaane kaa dam rakhti he
 The Delhi government gave this argument, on this matter, the officials of the Delhi government said that on the basis of sympathy, only the jobs of Group c and Group d (clerical level) can be given
 rohit ke parivaarane dilli main basane kii ichha jaahir kii thi or raja vemula ke liye naukari kii guzarish kii thi

 ' shooting jaise khelon main pratiyogita kii kami, inami rakam or media main tavajjo na milane kaa ronaa lambey samay se chalata aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, some Olympic shooters organized a unique tournament and gave young shooters a new platform
 pichley hafte dilli ke karni singh shooting range main ek alag tarah kaa mela laga rahaa
 300 shooters aiming to increase the range of this range
 purv world champion maanavjit singh sandhu, purv world number 1 shooter ronjan sodhi, mahila nishanebaaj olympian shagun choudhary, shooting sangh ke adhyaksh ranni singh or aam bhartiya shooter yah sab ek plateform par nishaanaa lagaate rahe
 One could win the prize by defeating each other
 bharat main apni tarah kaa yah anoothaa toornament tha
 In this tournament with a prize money of 35 lakhs, the shooters continued to compete with each other and boost their spirits
 toornament main ek yuva or aam shooter bhi jeet hasil kar sake isliye isamen golf kii tarah hendicap system lagu kiya gaya
 In fact, just like Europe, shooters like Ronjan Sodhi and Manavjit Sandhu in India gave an opportunity to around 300 shooters to target a platform at the Indian Shotgun Open
 ronjan sodhi kehete hai ki ek to bharat main koi prise mani toornament nahin he isliye hamane sochaa ki agar is tarah ke toornament kaa aayojan hota he to shooting ko lekar logon kii dilchaspee badhegi
 Secondly, we implemented a handicap system so that young shooters get a chance to win and there is pressure on international shooters to shoot as per their name
 maanavjit singh sandhu kehete hai ki cricket main ipel kitna acha plateform he, aisa duusare khelon main bahut kam he isliye ham 35 lakh kaa shooting kaa toornament lekar aae hai
 About 100 shooters are scheduled to get reward here
 olympic str par nishaanaa lagane vaale maujuuda or purv shooter maanate hai ki isse yuvaaon main khel kii lokapriyata to badhegi hi duusare kai phaayde honge
 Shagun Chaudhary, India's first woman Olympian trap shooter, says this will definitely enhance the status of the shooting
 isse aam logon main bhi shooting kaa maahaul banegaa
 More people can show interest for this
 chaar baar ke olympian trep shooter mansher singh kehete hai ki is tarah kii shooting main manze hue shooters ko ek phayda yah he ki vah is dauraan experiment kar sakate hai
 Organizing prize shooting tournaments is not that easy
 35 lakh kii inami raashi vaale toornament ke liye ronjan or maanavjit ko papad belane pad gaye
 On the last day, there was difficulty in the strong rain, but the gun fire of the shooters kept on blowing
 kai sootars iske bhi phaayde dekhte hai
 National champion shooter Shreyasi Singh says that the audience made a noise while shooting Ronjan Sodhi at the 2012 London Olympics
 unka dhyaan banta diya or uskaa unhen bada khamiyaja bhugatna padaa
 Right now the weather is bad and hooting is also happening here
 yahaan Shooting in difficult conditions can be good practice
 indian shotgan open ke sah-praayojak maanav rachana uniwarsity ke amit bhalla kehete hai ki kisi bhi khel ko ahm banane main media kaa role ahm hota he
 The media should pay attention to these sports, because these sports get you medals in the Olympics, but he believes that these games will really benefit if there is live telecast of such tournaments
 itnaa jarur hua ki hissaa lene vaale shooters ne is toornament kii khub tarif kii, lekin televijan media ke liye yah toornament phir bhi haashiye par rahaa
 In spite of organizing a different and spectacular tournament, often the condition of these games becomes a proverb like who saw the peacock in the jungle
 adhikariyon or aayojakon ko yah samajhane kii jarurat he ki live telecast media or bazaar kaa masalaa ek-duusare se judaa hua he or inamen se kisi ek ke nahin hone se isaki lokapriyata par asar jarur padataa he

 Rahul, who is campaigning for the party in Karnataka, tweeted, "modi's report card in Karnataka's agriculture sector: The state government waived farmers' debt of Rs 8,500 crore, but the Center's contribution to it was zero
 '' unhone kaha, ''pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana: kisaan pareshaan hai or nijee beemaa companiyon ko bada munafa hota he

 france se 36 ladaaku vimaan kharidne ke faisle par rakshaamantri manohar parrikar ne solah aane sach kaha he ki isse bhartiya vayusena ko oxigen milegi
 There is no doubt that the Indian Air Force's firepower has been steadily decreasing for the past several years
 khaskar china or pakistan se milane vaali chunautiyon ko dekhte hue
 Though immediate relief from this oxygen will be given in view of the needs of the Air Force, but some concrete arrangements will have to be made for the future
 dashakon se chal rahi mmrsie yani kii medium multi role combet airkaft deal kii jagah ab sidhe france kii daason company se chaar billian dollar yani kareeb chaar hajaar karod rupee ke aas paas kii deal hogi
 It simply means that the cost of a Rafale aircraft will come to around 600 crores
 badi baat yah he ki in vimaanon kii aapurti do khep main or do saal ke bheetar ho jaaegi
 At the moment neither it will be made in the country nor is there any condition of transfer of technology
 tatkaalik rup se dekhen to isse do phaayde honge ek to vayusena ko jald vimaan milenge, keemat kam or behatar hogi
 Air chief Marshal SP Tyagi, former chief of the Air Force, says that since 2001 you were thinking of buying fighter aircraft, but were not able to take a decision, in the current situation there can be no better decision
 vaise bhi vayusena kii takat ghatati ja rahi thi 15 saal ho gaye jab koi vimaan kharida gaya tha
 Mig are getting old and many squadrons are merely running on paper
 saal 2020 tak vayusena ke 12 scovdran ritair ho rahe hai, to phir inaki jagah lene vaale vimaan he kahaan?hindustan aronetics limited yani ki echeel jis raftaar se lite combet airkaft bana rahi he to pataa nahin kab vah bhartiya vayusena kii sahi myne main takat ban paaenge
 The Air Force is seeking a Mark-2 LCA in place of the existing LCS, but is yet to find any details
 abhi yah bhi tay nahin ki usamen ingine koun sa lagegaa
 In such a situation, only counting options are left, for example, and Sukhoi should be purchased
 lekin abhi tak iske ingine or ijection main dikkat bani hui he, jise dur kiye bagaiyr kaam nahin chalegaa
 It is also being said from above that Sukhoi is cheaper, but its life cycle cost is expensive
 rahi sahi kasar rus kii khasta haalat puri kar detaa he
 That is why Air Chief Marshal PV Nayak, another former chief of the Air Force, says that there could be no better deal than Rafal
 philhal to yah vimaan aaenge, usase anubhav lekar baad main jarurat padane par or vimaan bhi khride ja sakate hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has understood the need of the Air Force by pulling out the trapped deal
 yah sahi he ki vayusena ko turant ladaaku vimaan chahie, kyonki ye ek oparational jarurat he
 The government did not have many options
 isi vajah se yah sauda kiya gaya
 Anyway, the firepower of the Indian Air Force was decreasing compared to Pakistan
 vayusena kii jarurat kareeb 40 scovdran kii he or philhal 28 ke aasapaas hi scovdran bache hai
 Of these, 12 Skadravans are of old mig
 haalanki kai kah sakate hai ki ek sukhoi to chah mig ke baraabar hota he, to aise main koi khaas fark nahin padegaa
 But these are the things to say that whenever there is a war, then the shortcomings of our better weapons were revealed
 chaahe 1962 kii baat kare yaa phir 1999 main hui kargil jang kii
 Air Force officials are not openly speaking about the deal, but they are saying that we have asked for 126 fighter aircraft and are getting just 36, while the challenges are increasing rather than decreasing
 force magazine ke sampadak praveen saahani kii maane to pehali baat sarkaar ke paas abhi itnaa paisa nahin he ki vah vayusena par bees billian dollar se zyada kharch kar 126 ladaaku vimaan kharide
 The situation today is that the aircraft that the Air Force will get will have to operate from them
 ye or baat he ki vah iske alaava kar bhi kya kar sakati he?ye vimaan kareeb 40 saal tak chalegaa hi
 It was the Air Force that made this aircraft OK despite many others
 haa is vimaan ke aane se mentenance or duusare anya intjaam jarur karne padenge jo aasaan nahin hoga
 Probably not many people will know that the Air Force now has six types of fighter aircraft and the seventh is coming
 agar rus ke saath milakar ban rahaa paanchavi peedi kaa ladaaku vimaan ban jaataa he to aathvin tarah kaa vimaan hoga
 There is no other country in the world that has so many aircraft
 har vimaan kaa rakh rakhaav alag tarah se hota he
 Tomorrow Puraja is different
 samajha ja saktaa he ki in vimaanon ko feet rakhane main vayusena ko kitni dikkat aati hogi
 Another big question will be about pm's Make in India? Its option is open after taking the aircraft
 agar baat banati he to or agar rafaal vimaan kharidte hai to use hindustan main bana sakate hai
 Providing further improvement in the condition of HAL, it would win the trust of the Air Force and slaves and make world class fighter aircraft
 mohan gurusvaamiis varsh 2019 ke pu research ke mutabik, do-tihaai bhartiya bhrashtachar ko aatankwaad or aparaadh kii tarah hi badi samasya maanate hai or use berogari tathaa mahangaai ke fouran baad sabase ahm mudda bataate hai
 It is also a matter of common perception and debate
 jahaan bhi or jab bhi do log desh ke marz par gambhir bahes karne baithte hai, ve sarvada bhrashtachar ko hamaari rashtriya durdasha kii mukhya vajah bataane se nahin chookte
 Look at the irony that the perception of corruption has become so much at home that we now see it as a stigma
 haalanki bhartiya log duusare ke chhidranveshan main kuch zyada hi ruchi lete hai
 We let corrupt leaders win elections and accumulating wealth in dubious ways is no longer seen as some kind of social stigma

 With no significant achievement in matters of employment generation or economic growth, Modi once again made his government's actions against "corruption" his political agenda
 lagbhag hameshaa yah dhun bajaai jane lagi ki ve ''luute hue dhan kii pai-pai waapas laae bina chaiyn nahin lenge
 He also tried to capitalize on the general dissatisfaction against rising non-parity and said that the middle class contributed heavily to the economy but most of the money went to the pockets of a small number of people with the help of corrupt politicians and bureaucrats

 Whatever be the Modi government's credibility in the campaign against corruption and selective actions like it, it is difficult to have any kind of sympathy with those who came under scrutiny
 chori yaa lut yaa dhokhadhadi karne waalon se koi sahanubhuti nahin honi chahie
 And it also cannot be denied that corruption is common
 transperency international or community soshal media network localsrcuiles ke 2018 ke ek survey ke mutabik, 54 pratishat bharatiyon ne mana ki unhone pichley ek saal main pratyaksh yaa paroksh tareeke se saarvajanik sevaaon ke liye rishwat di he
 Last year, the figure was 45 percent, but even more worrying with this increase is that nearly a third of people believe that bribe is the only way to get any work done in the government
 haal ke dinon main udyog jagat ke log tathakthith 'tex aatankwaad' ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaate rahe hai, iskaa matlab sarkaar ko dey rakam ko jutaney ke liye tex adhikariyon kii tej muhim se he
 According to several surveys, tax evasion is also very common
 masalan, yah mana jaataa he ki 50 lakh ru
 5 crores from Rs
 tak kii aamadani vaale 10 logon main se keval ek hi asal main tex ritern daakhil karata he
 This is clearly a case of tax evasion, but there are more cases of underperformance
 sarkaar puunjigat kharch main ijapha karne main asamarth he, jiskaa sidhaa asar rojgaar srijan par hota he
 And it is also unable to increase the ratio of tax and GDP
 isliye is morche par adhik teji samaj main aati he
 But is this 'tax terrorism'? The government is adopting strict methods to raise its dues
 isliye aashcharya nahin ki kai logon ko aisa lagata he ki sarkaar kuch zyada hi sakhti dikhaa rahi he
 Coffee Day founder V

 ji
 The example of Siddharth's suicide is given
 ho saktaa he ki log sarkaar ko dey raashi apane paas rakhane ke aadi ho gaye hon or aksar bade paimaane par kar vanchanaa karke batch jate hai
 Hence the current boom in tax authorities is being seen as tax terrorism
 lekin yah tex aatankwaad kii galat vyakhya he
 Which actually shows the way of tax evasion at higher rates
 iskar or jiesti ke adhikari ab lagaataar aise notice jari karne lage hai ki sambandhit vyakti sambandhit daftaron main pahunche yaa phir jurmaana bharen
 It seems that such notices have been lost in thousands, if not millions
 bank khate ab pan or aadhaar numberon se jud gaye hai, to adhikansh iskar ritern kii jaanch computer se honi chahie or adhikariyon ke haath se vivekadhikaar khatm kiya janaa chahie
 Actually, the tax authorities should focus on tax evasion, which is not always straightforward evasion, provided we believe the survey
 iske adhikariyon ko kuch adhik kaam karnaa padegaa
 Despite this, can the action of tax officials be called 'tax terrorism'? When tax evasion is common, the action of tax authorities is also expected to accelerate
 lekin jab aisi karrwai main pakshpaat dikhataa he to tex aatankwaad kaa tamgaa chaspaan hone lagata he
 Unfortunately, the Modi government has not been able to set a credible example of trying without bias and discrimination in its campaign of action against the corrupt
 rajnatik partiyon kii funding kaa sabase bada yaa shaayad ekmaatr strot bade udyogpatiyon, chote kaarobaariyon or chote thekedaaron se ugaahi he, jo iske badale main phaayde yaa rasookh hasil karte hai
 The wealth of the big businessmen or the large sections of the newly born has increased through the profits received from the government, which has everything under its control, which increases the business
 telecom se lekar tel, koyala, steel, infrastracchar pariyojnaayen or airline sabhi kii kamyaabi main sarkaar kii bhoomika ahm he
 For this reason, money reaches the pockets of politicians and opinion makers

 2019 main kharch hui kul rakam main bhaajapa ne kareeb 45 pratishat kharch kiya, jabaki 1998 main kharch main uskaa hissaa mahaj 20 pratishat tha
 On the other hand, the Congress spent 40 per cent of the total electoral expenditure in the 2009 elections while in power, while in 2019 its spending is about 15-20 per cent
 yah paisa to kahin se aa rahaa he or uski vajahen bhi acchhee-khaasi hai
 Money is like mother's milk for politics
 is tarah tex aatankwaad bhi is pravaah ko kisi or ke paksh main karne or dusron se dur le jane kaa aujaar he
 But, as long as tax evasion continues to occur on a large scale and the tax evasion prevails, then the unsolicited notion of tax terrorism will also remain

 Often the water dispute between Delhi and Haryana is in the headlines
 donon rajya ek duusare par isko lekar aarope-pratyarope karte rahe hai
 In fact, Delhi needs 1133 cusecs of water daily from the neighboring state of Haryana to meet its water requirement
 isi ko lekar puraa vivaad he
 It provides water to Delhi through its CLC, DSB and Yamuna
 CLC ke jariye 683 kusek pani haryana dilli ko detaa he
 Whereas DSB gives 330 cusecs and Yamuna gives 120 cusecs of water
 is tarah kul 1133 kusek pani dilli ke okhla, bavana, dwarka, wazirabad, haidarpur plant main store kar pine yogya banaaya jaataa he
 Which is supplied by Jal Board in Delhi
 gauratlab he ki isi saal farvari main dilli sarkaar ne pani kii samasya par engiti kaa darwaja khatkhataya or haryana par aarope lagaaya ki yamuna ke pani main ammonia kaa str kai guna bad gaya he
 Due to this, the Jal Board is unable to provide water to the residents of Delhi
 dilli sarkaar ne engiti main ye bhi kaha ki rajya ke adhikari ne pehle baatcheet ke jariye samasya kaa hal nikaalane kii koshish ki, lekin jab hal nahin niklaa to engiti main yachika daakhil kii gai
 Not only this, this case also reached the Supreme Court as the NGT progressed
 aakhirkaar supreme court ne rajya ke sabase bade adhikari ko talab kar liya
 At the same time, Haryana raised many questions from Delhi in the NGT as well as in the Supreme Court and repeatedly reiterated that it is giving 1133 cusecs of water daily to Delhi
 CLC or DSB ke jariye jo pani bheja jaataa he dilli uskaa istemaal sidhe pine ke liye kar saktaa he
 But, he also uses it for many other works like farming
 dilli apane plant ko apgrade nahin kar rahaa he
 Whereas in other states, there are many more good plants that can directly clean sewer water
 hathni kunda se pani nahin aa rahaa he to wo kya kar sakate hai
 Haryana even said that the level of ammonia has increased in Yamuna water because there is no flow in Yamuna water
 gauratlab he ki CLC or DSB se kul milakar 1013 kusek pani dilli main aata he
 However, the 120 cusecs of water that comes through the Yamuna is first cleaned at the Wazirabad plant
 wazirabad plant se sidhe pani north west dilli, lutiyans jone, central or north dilli supplai hota he
 So there was a shortage of water here recently
 baharhaal, samay ke saath apane system ko bhi apgrade karnaa padataa he
 If the Wazirabad plant had been upgraded, this problem would not have come today

 While answering a question of Congress MLA Hardeep Singh Dung, the Home Minister of Kamal Nath Government, Bala Bachchan has said that criminal cases were registered against the farmers as per the legal process
 darasal, congress ke vidhayak hardip singh dang ne grahamantri bala bachchan se sawaal poocha tha ki may or june 2017 main kitne kisaanon ke khilaaf raajnneetik dweshtapurna maamle darj kiye gaye hai or rajya sarkaar ne un par kya karrwai kii he? is sawaal kaa grih mantri bala bachchan ne likhit jawaab diya he ki vidhi sammat prakriya ke tahat us samay kisaanon par aapraadhik prakaran darj kiye gaye hai
 When Home Minister Bala Bachchan gave a clean chit to the then BJP government, legitimizing the action of the police against the farmers in the Shivraj government, the question is bound to arise

 Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Gopal Bhargava said that the Congress had tried to create an atmosphere of lies, confusion regarding the peasant movement and publicized that the BJP government acted in a repressive manner, but the falsehood spread by the Congress today was its own MLA
 Opened by the question put in the assembly
 congress jhooth kii raajnneeti karti he yah phir se jagajaahir ho gaya he
 Gopal Bhargava said that the Congress tries to prove the truth by speaking a lie ten times, but the public will not fall into the lies of the Congress
 unhone kaha ki congress ke jimmedaar netaaon ko yah bataanaa chahie ki chunaav ke samay jo bate kahi gai thi vah jhooth tha yaa aaj vidhansabha main kisaan andolan ko lekar jo baat kahi gai he vah jhooth he? kisaanon ko lekar jhooth kii raajnneeti karne vaali congress ek baar phir benakaab ho gai he

 ' The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has demanded the re-introduction of the old election system of ballots amid the Election Commission's announcement to call an all-party meeting on fears that the electronic voting machine (EVM) may be tampered with
 sangh ke mukhpatr argeniser ke sampadkeey main kaha gaya, ‘kya iviem se chhedchhad nahin ho sakati
 Experts say this can happen, although the Election Commission has made it a question of its nose unnecessarily
 ’ isamen kaha gaya, ‘yah baat sach he ki manushya ne aisi kisi bhi mashin kaa nirmaan nahin kiya he, jisase chhedchhad nahin ho sakati he
 The credibility of any system depends on its transparency, validation and trust
 ’bhaajapa pravaktaa ravi shankar prasad ne sangh ke vichaaron se sahmati jataate hue kaha ki iviem kaa das saal se istemaal hota aa rahaa he or ab samay aa gaya he, jab isaki vishwasaneeyata kaa lekhajokha kiya jaae
 It is also important to remove the confusion prevailing among the public and some political parties about this
 mukhya chunaav ayukta es vaai kureshi kaa haalanki kahana he ki iviem se koi chhedchhad nahin ho sakati or yah barason kade pareekshan se gujara hua upkaran he
 Despite this, the Commission said that it is calling an all-party meeting on this issue and will consider the suggestions given therein with an open mind
 sangh ne kaha ki yadi ayog ko vishwaas he ki iviem se chhedchhad nahin ho sakati to koi vajah nahin ki vah isaki saarvajanik jaanch karaane se pareshaan ho
 Unfortunately, its expert PV Indiresan has taken an unscientific stand on the issue, as if his words are the last word about EVM and there is no need for its correction or review
 sangh ne kaha ki duniya bhar main matadaata iviem ko andeh kii najar se dekhte hai
 Countries such as the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and Ireland, which initially implemented it, have banned evms because they believe it can be easily rigged
 isane kaha ki chunaav ayog or sarkaar bhartiya loktantr par iviem ko nirvivaadit cheez ke rup main thope nahin sakate
 If democracy is to be pursued as a dynamic system, then the government cannot impose its stubbornness on the voter as the only option
 mukhpatr main kaha gaya ki mataptr pranali kii apni khaamiyon kii vajah se iviem astitv main aayi
 Voting through ballot papers led to allegations of booth capturing, rigging, fake voting, ballot snatching
 aise main iviem ko adhik prabhaavshaalee upkaran ke rup main pesh kiya gaya lekin yahi shikaayatein is par bhi lagu hoti hai
 It can also be rigged at the time of counting
 isamen kaha gaya ki matapatron kii pranali matadaata ke anukool hoti he kyonki jo kuch bhi gadabad hoti he, janata kii najaron main hoti he
 In the case of evms, it is confined to the eyes of those who are appointed by the ruling political parties to oversee the system
 sangh ne daawa kiya ki sattadhari party apekshit parinaam hasil karne ke liye iviem se chhedchhad kar sakati he
 After the use of evms, the enjoyment of the electoral process at the time of arranging ballots has ended

 rija ne shuukravaar ko ‘23 disambar alliance’ kii ore se yojit ek raily main bharat ke ucchayukta dayaneshwar mulay ko ‘gaddaar’ or ‘maldive kaa ek dushman’ kaha tha
 The rally was held to protest the decision of the government of former President Muhammad Nasheed, in which Ibrahim Nasir International Airport was leased to India's company GMR
 rija ne kaha, ‘‘ek rajanyik kaa kaam apane desh evam logon ke liye kaam karnaa he, naa ki ek nijee company ke hiton kii raksha karnaa
 
 vah gaddaar or maldive evam maldive ke logon ke dushman hai
 We do not want such diplomats here

 The statement said that these are not the views of the government
 bharat ke ucchayog kii ore se jari ek bayaan main rija ke is bayaan kii ninda kii gai or ise ‘‘rajanyik protocol ke viruddh’’ bataaya gaya
 Riza later claimed that he did not call Mulaya a "traitor" and simply said that "we have a new demand after GMR leaves, Mulay should also go
" ’’ He said, "I said that the people who are expected to protect India's greater interests in the Maldives are not doing so
" unhone jiemr se rishwat lee
 They are traitors
 maine kisi kaa naam nahin liya
 "riza said that if Mulaya had" understood the feelings of the people, then things would not have reached this level
 logon ne sarkaar ko chah dinon kaa vakt diya
 What can we do in six days? '' unhone kaha, ‘‘unka (mulay) naam lekar (unke waapas jane kii maang ke dauraan) maine tanaav ko kam karne kii koshish kii
 The High Commissioner of India is trying to save an illegal agreement
 ’’ On the other hand, the High Commission statement said that it is interesting to note that after assuming office in 2012, the President of Maldives assured India and during his visit to New Delhi, he also assured Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that The investments of all companies in India including GMR will be protected
 jiemr maldive main nivesh karne vaali sabase badi company he
 The High Commission of India statement also said that the Maldives government has been told that big issues of common interest should not be raised in public or on the platform
 isamen kaha gaya ki maldive kii nai sarkaar ne jiemr samet kuch mudde uthaae hai or in muddon kaa hal baatcheet ke jariye nikaala ja saktaa he
 In the event of negotiations failing, this country can take the path of arbitration
 tippaniyan On the other hand, in a statement released on the website of the President of Maldives, the government has distanced itself from this statement
 is bayaan main kaha gaya he, ‘‘yah jamaavada kuch rajnatik dalon or kuch logon ne kiya tha
 The views put on this rally by Abbas Adil Riza, though these were his views, are regrettable
 yah maldive sarkaar ke vichaar nahin hai, vishesh taur par maldive main bharat ke ucchayukta dm mulay ke khilaaf diya gaya bayaan

 Riza said, "the job of a diplomat is to work for our country and people, not to protect the interests of a private company
" 
 They are traitors and enemies of the Maldives and Maldives
 ham apane yahaan is tarah ke rajanyik nahin chaahate
 However, a statement later released on the official website of President Muhammad Waheed stated that the Maldives government distinguished itself from the statements of Abbas Adil Riza and some other government officials
 bayaan main kaha gaya ki ye sarkaar ke vichaar nahin hai
 In a statement issued by the High Commission of India, Riza's statement was condemned and described as "against diplomatic protocol"
 baad main rija ne daawa ki unhone mulay ko ‘‘gaddaar’’ nahin kaha or sirf yah kaha ki ‘‘jiemr ke jane ke baad hamaari ek nai maang he, mulay ko bhi janaa chahie
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘maine kaha tha ki jin logon se maldive main bharat ke vrahat hiton kii raksha karne kii apeksha kii jaati he, ve aisa nahin kar rahe hai
 He received a bribe from GMR
 ve gaddaar hai

 ’’ rija ne kaha ki agar mulay ne ‘‘logon kii bhaawanaaon ko samajha hota, to baaten is str tak nahin pahunchatin
 People gave the government six days
 chah dinon main ham kya kar sakate hai?’’ He said, "by taking his (mulay) name (during his demand to return), i tried to ease the tension
" bharat ke ucchayukta ek avaidh qaraar ko bachaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 '' udhar, ucchayog ke bayaan main kaha gaya ki is sandarbh main gaur karne vaali baat he ki varsh 2012 main padbhaar sanbhaalane ke baad maldive ke raashtrapati ne bharat ko aashwaasan diya or nai dilli ke apane daure main unhone pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko bhi aashwast kiya tha ki jiemr samet bharat kii sabhi companiyon ke nivesh kii raksha kii jaaegi
 GMR is the largest company to invest in Maldives
 bharat ke ucchayog ke bayaan main yah bhi kaha gaya ki maldive sarkaar ko bataaya gaya he ki saajha hiton ke bade muddon ko saarvajanik taur par yaa manch par nahin uchhaala janaa chahie
