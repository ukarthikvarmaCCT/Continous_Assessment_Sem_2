 ” # 63notout kashmir main ab tasviir saaf hoti najar aa rahi he, or lagane laga he ki congress or neshnal conference (ensi) ke bich baat ban gai he or ensi rajyasabha chunaav main gulam nabi aaazaad ko samarthan dene ke liye taiyaar ho gai he
 
 
 For Azad, it became a question of life and death, as his Rajya Sabha seat was stuck
 
 
 congress ke paas utane vidhayak nahin the or ab tak pidipi or neshnal conference ke saath bhi baat nahin ban paa rahi thi
 
 
 Azad was busy working hard to get the support of the National Conference, so that it would become a jugaad to re-enter the Rajya Sabha, otherwise the chair of the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha would have gone
 
 
 darasal, aaazaad ko rajyasabha main jane ke liye 29 vidhayakon kaa samarthan chahie, or ab vah neshnal conference or kuch nirdaleeyon ke saath milakar vahaan pahunch jaaenge
 
 
 On the other hand, the conversation between BJP and PDP is also being seen
 
 
 ram madhav ne kaha he ki pidipi ke saath bijepi kii baatcheet sakaaratmak disha main aage bad rahi he or jammu-kashmir main jald hi sarkaar banegi
 
 
 This can also be understood from the fact that the BJP is in a position to get only one Rajya Sabha seat on its own from the state, but still it has fielded two candidates
 
 
 is ummid main ki yadi pidipi ke saath baat ban jaati he to donon ummidavaaron ko jitayaa ja sakegaa
 
 
 But the screw is still stuck on who will be the chief minister
 
 
 police ab is gang ke mastermind or baaki logon kii talash kar rahi he
 The biggest question is on those banks where fake accounts were opened because it is not easy after KYC is implemented
 har saal bajet aata he
 There is a shortage in education and health every year
 lokapriy muddon ke thamate hi shiksha or swasthya par lekh aata he
 In the hope that health questions will enter the public consciousness better
 aisa kabhi nahin hota
 People ignore him

 Here are some points of this article - This time the budget is 7000 crores more than the last time
 -praathmik swasthya seva sarkaar kii praathamikta se baahar hoti ja rahi he
 The National Rural Health Mission (NHRM) share in the health budget has decreased
 -mishan kaa kaam praathmik chikitsa system ko fund uplabdh karwaanaa he
 It was 52 percent in 2015-16, which has been reduced to 41 percent this year
 -NHRM ke bheetar garbhvatee mahilaon or bacchon kii yojanaon main katautee kii gai he
 The budget for rural health infrastructure has also been reduced
 -sankramit bimaariyaan jaise tapedic, diaria, neumonia, hepatitis ke kaaryakramon ko jhatka laga he
 There is talk of replacing the Primary Health Center with a wellness center, which will focus on non-infectious diseases
 -isse bharat main praathmik chikitsa seva main koi khaas behatari nahin aegi
 - In a way, the rural healthcare system is being demolished
 -rashtriya shahari swasthya mishan kaa bajet gata diya gaya he
 3,391 crores was needed, 950 crores has been received
 -ames jaise sansthaanon ko banane ke liye jo bajet kaa praavdhaan he usamen ek kism kaa tehraav dikhataa he
 Read the report of the Parliamentary Committee
 shuru ke chah ames main 55 se 75 pratishat medical prophessoron ke pad khaali hai
 Some departments have been declared operational
 -zila aspataalon ko apgrade karne kaa bajet 39 pratishat kam kar diya gaya he
 The budget of Prime Minister Jan Arogya Yojana has increased the most
 6,556 karod diya gaya he
 - Under this scheme 10 crore poor people will be given insurance up to 5 lakhs per annum
 -itani badi sankhya ko beemaa dene ke liye yah bajet bhi kaaphi kam hi he
 24 of India as per National Sample Survey Health Data 2014
 85 karod pariwaron main se 5
 72 crore families visit the hospital every year
 is hisaab se 10 karod pariwaron main se har saal 2
 3 crore families will go to the hospital
 matlab yah hua ki beemaa company ke paas har bhartee par dene ke liye 2,850 rupee hi honge
 The average spending from your pocket is still very high
 neshnal sample survey 2014 ke anusaar us saal 15,244 rupee kaa ausat tha jo 2019-20 main 19,500 rupee ho gaya hoga
 Health insurance covers only 15 percent of this expenditure
 -kuch sector main 2018-19 ke bajet kaa puraa istamaal hi nahin hua he
 Only 78 percent of the budget of National Rural Drinking Water Scheme was used
 pradhanmantri matra vandana yojana kaa bajet bhi 50 fisadi hissaa bachaa rah gaya
 The budget of Swachh Bharat Mission (gramin) was also left
 nateeja yah hua ki 2018-19 main 15,343 karod diya gaya tha, is saal ke bajet main ghataakar 10,000 karod kar diya gaya he
 Imrana Qadir and Saurindra Ghosha argue that whatever is increased in the budget, the priority for the use of that money should be fixed properly
 sarkari aspataal ke dhaanche ko behatar karne main hona chahie na ki beemaa polisy par
 - National sample survey data 2014 shows that 97 diseases are treated in OPD in India
 is par medical kharche kaa 67 fisadi hissaa karch hota he
 In this sense, most treatment is outside insurance
 aapane upar dekha hi ki is par ausat kharchaa bhi 19,000 ke kareeb ho gaya he
 In a way, these insurance policies are an idea of filling public money in the corporate treasury
 aap isse privet sector se swasthya suvidhaayen kareed sakate hai jabaki sarkaar kaa paisa sarkari system banane or majboot karne main karch hona chahie taaki garib ko phayda ho or opidi kaa ilaaj sasta ho
 You must have heard about Jan Aushadhi Centers where the government claims to provide generic medicines at affordable rates
 aabaadi ke anupaat main iske store bahut hi kam hai
 a store with a population of three and a half million
 yahaan bhi kuch dawaaen bazaar se mahangi hai
 Doctors do not prescribe medicines available in these stores on prescription
 to kuch store zarur logon ko raahat pahunchaa rahe hai magar haal vahi he
 Show that something has happened and tell that it has happened
 -tamaam beemaa polisy ke baad bhi aap dekhte rahenge ki garib mariz kisi sadsy ko thele par lad kar le ja rahaa he
 There are no ambulances to carry the corpse
 kyonki ham sabaki praathamiktaayen badal gayi hai
 We like the notion
 sarkaar das lakh logon ko laabh pahunchane kii baat karti he
 Do you know which of those diseases have been treated more? kin aspataalon main ilaaj hua he
 How many patients have insurance and what percentage used it

 jaankaree ke mutabik, is yojana ke liye upi tourism or roadways ke bich sahmati ban gai he, jald hi emoyu par hastakshar kiya jayega
 The road map has been prepared in a meeting between UP Roadways Managing Director Mukesh Meshram and UP Tourism Director General Amrit Abhijat
 package tour main buddha paripath ke saath prasiddh dharmik sthalon kaa bhraman karaayaa jayega
 The first package tour will be from Lucknow to Naimisharanya via Chandrika Devi Temple
 isamen ek din kaa samay lagegaa

 These security forces are always ready to stand shoulder to shoulder with the army

 But the facilities available to the Indian Army in the name of facilities are not available to the paramilitary forces
 vahiin pension bhi unhen sena ke javaanon kii tarah nahin milti he
 On March 3, retired paramilitary personnel are going to protest at Jantar Mantar in Delhi to demand the same pension
 lekin sawaal he ki aakhir kyon ardhsainik balon ko sena kii tarah suvidhaayen nahin di jaati hai
 Why are the facilities not available, the governments have never been officially given the reason for the difference between the army and paramilitary forces, but it is definitely said that the functioning of the army is more challenging than the personnel of the paramilitary forces it occurs
 unke chayan se lekar kaam karne ke tareeke tak kii prakriya behad sakht hoti he
 This is the reason that the army is given more facilities than the paramilitary forces
 is tark ko ardhsainik bal ke jawan bhi maanate hai
 Retired personnel of the paramilitary force also say that the army is the number one force in the country but the demands of the paramilitary forces should also be considered
 
 They have better quality training and are better than us but paramilitary forces also want their authority
 kya he sena or ardhsainik balon kii suvidha main antarsena or ardhsainik balon kii suvidha main sabase bada antar pension kaa he
 Actually, army gets pension under old pension scheme whereas from 1 January 2004 paramilitary forces are given pension under National Pension Scheme
 puraani pension yojana main karmchaaree ko apane vetan se kuch nahin dena hota tha
 At the same time, the soldiers used to get about 50 percent of their salary in the last month after retirement as pension
 jabaki neshnal pension skim main ardhsainik bal kaa jawan 10 fisadi sahyog detaa he to vahiin sarkaar ab 14 fisadi kaa yogadan detii he

 In Chhattisgarh, Yogi Adityanath linked the conversion of the tribals to the Congress leadership, while in Madhya Pradesh, the Yogi pointed to the Congress and said that you should have Ali Mubarak Bajrang Bali enough for us
 rajasthan main bijepi ne ranneeti ke tahat yogi adityanath kaa istemaal un siton par kiya jahaan se congress ke muslim ummidavaar maidan main the
 While Yogi Adityanath in Hyderabad, the stronghold of Asaduddin Owaisi in Telangana, said that the name of Hyderabad would be changed to Bhagyanagar if the government was formed and the Owaisi brothers would leave Hyderabad as the Nizams had fled
 haalanki in vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko kuch khaas safalataa hasil nahin hui
 In Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, which had been in operation for 15 years, BJP lost power
 to vahiin rajasthan main bhi bijepi ko munh kii khaani padi
 But among all this, the brand of Yogi Adityanath remained intact
 pichley dinon yogi adityanath kii pashchim bengal yatra kaaphi charchaa main rahi jab mukhyamantri mamata ne unke helicopter ko utarane kii ijaajat nahin di to yogi sadak maarg se hi jansabha karne pahunch gaye
 Now the country is standing on the threshold of the Lok Sabha elections
 aise main berogari, krishi or aarthik vruddhi jaise tamaam mudde hai jo bijepi ke saamne mushkil khadi kar sakate hai
 Hence, for polarization of votes in the name of Hindu nationalism, the BJP may once again need its firebrand star campaigner Yogi Adityanath

 The GST Council, in its 34th meeting held in Delhi, has finalized the new rates on residential flats
 kaha ja rahaa he ki isse makaan or saste honge
 But in this, some such discounts have been given to the builders, due to which such things have started happening that buyers who have actually booked the house will not benefit and the GST Council has ignored such interests
 jiesti council ne mangalvaar ko apni baithak main jis transishan skim ko manjuuri di he, usamen bilderon ko vikalp diya gaya he ki abhi chaalu project par ve chahen to nai jiesti rate lagu karen yaa puraane rate hi jari rakhen
 The GST Council has given huge relief to the home buyers for such new projects
 afordable nirmaandhin makaanon ke liye jiesti rate 1 fisadi or anya makaanon ke liye 5 fisadi nirdhaarit kii gai he
 What is the perch? The decision to give builders an option to accept new rates or old rates in buildings under construction has raised questions about whether the GST council has taken care of the interests of the house buyers or the builders
 isaki vajah yah he ki aise project ke liye builder puraani rate hi jari rakhana chahenge, kyonki unhen is par input tex credit milegaa
 Earlier the effective rate of GST was 8% and it was 12% with input tax credit
 nai jiesti rate afordable nirmaanadhin makaan ke liye 1 fisadi or anya makaanon ke liye 5 fisadi hai
 This includes projects whose booking is done before April 1, 2019
 1 april, 2019 se shuru hone vaale nae project ke liye anivaary rup se nai daren lagu hongi
 For the ongoing projects which are not completed by March 31, 2019, the builders are allowed to deposit tax at the old rates (effective rate of 8% or 12% with input tax credit)
 haalanki, iske liye ek nishchit samay seemaa tay kii gai he

 Former Solicitor General Subramaniam has written a nine-page letter to Chief Justice RM Lodha in which he has withdrawn the consent given for appointment to the post of Supreme Court judge
 unhone likhaa he ki vah nahin chaahate ki unki padonnati kisi raajnneeti kaa masalaa bane

 He also wrote in the letter, "I do not expect this attitude to improve over time
" '' He said that he never met Modi except once, when he was Solicitor General and Modi was Chief Minister of Gujarat
 modi ne unhen or unki patni ko apane sammanit atithi ke rup main gujarat aamantrit kiya tha
 Although he did not receive their hospitality
 modi ne 'maryaadit tareeke se unka sammaan kiya tha
 ' subramanyam ne likhaa he ki vah amit shah se kabhi nahin mili or unhone haal main samachar patron main sirf unki tasviren hi dekhin thim
 According to the letter, during the hearing on Shah's bail application, he had said that his freedom should not be obstructed and he could be granted bail, but directed him to stay out of Gujarat
 nyamayurti lodha ko likhe patr main subramanyam ne kaha he ki yah sirf yahi ingit karata he ki amit shah ke prati mere man main koi vyaktigat pratishodh yaa kisi prakaar kaa vaimnasy kaa bhav nahin tha

 unhone vipakshi partiyon ke siem par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki jo sarkarein kisaanon kii list uplabdh nahin karaayengi kisaanon kii bad-duaen unki raajnneeti khatm kar dengi
 Targeting the Congress for not eating anyone a penny, Doongamodi said that the days were gone when 85 paisa of 1 rupee from the central government was eaten and only 15 paise was reached
 ab main ek paisa kisi ko khaane nahin duungaa
 The money will come in the bank account itself
 vaise to jandhan acount khul chuke hai lekin jiskaa acout nahin khulaa he vah khulavaa saktaa he
 There is no place for vicissitudes in this scheme
 agar aap labhaarthi hai or aapke acount main paise nahin aa rahe hai to aap jila prashasan se sampark kar sakate hai
 Modi while talking about MSP said that the central government has fulfilled the years old demand of farmers

 shivasena ne ravivaar ko apane mukhpatr ‘saamana’ ke sampadakeey menmusalamaanon se matadhikaar wapaslene kii baat kahi
 Argued that this would end the politics of Muslim vote bank
 lekin jab vivaad gaharaaya to party ne lekh par naram rukh bhi akhriyaar kar liya
 Shiv Sena's Legislative Council member and spokesperson Neelam Gore said, "the article attempts to say that for development in every sphere of life it is necessary that some leaders abandon the politics of appeasement as it is not in the interest of Muslims
" ye log samudaay kii vastav main madad kiye bina unhen keval gumraah kar rahe hai
 'he said,' If Muslims are used in this way only for politics then they can never develop
 jab tak muslim vot bank kii raajnneeti ke liye istemaal hote rahenge, unka koi bhavishya nahin hoga or isliye balasahab ne ek baar kaha tha ki muslimon ke matdaan ke adhikaar ko waapas liya jaae
 'the use of Muslims for personal gain, the party made it clear that Shiv Sena is against the politics of appeasement and violation of basic rights of Muslim women
 gore ne kaha, 'lekh main aisa nahin chaha gaya he ki muslimon ke matadhikaar ko chin liya jaae, lekin ovaisi jaise logon ke liye muslimon kii maharam rahane kii bhaavana ko poshit karte rahanaa thik nahin he
 They have been bereft of overall development and are being used and misled for personal gain
 shivasena saansad or saamana ke sampadak sanjay raut tushtikaran kii is raajnneeti kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 The spokesman said that the article should be viewed from a holistic perspective and not against the Muslim community
 unhone kaha, 'shivasena main sabhi jatiyon ke log kaam kar rahe hai
 We have been against the malicious politics being done in the name of Muslims
 ' neelam gore ne kaha ki babasahab ambedkar jaise logon ke sangharsh ke kaaran or loktantric desh ke samgr vikaas ke kaaran hindu mahilaon ke liye kanoonon main badlaav hote rahe hai
 She said, 'muslim women have also been deprived of this
 When i look at this subject as a female leader, i feel that these laws should be changed instead of bringing women under the purview of gender bias laws

 To calm the angry people, Lakhanpal asks for patience
 pundhir poochhate hai, 'aakhir ham kaise shant rahen', or yah kehete hue unki aawaaj bhavuk ho uthati he
 Lakhanpal assures the Rajputs that they have asked the police to conduct a fair investigation
 unhone kaha, 'maine police se kaha he ki jo koi bhi doshi ho use bakhsha nahin janaa chahie lekin kisi par bhi galat aarope bhi nahin lagane chahie
 ' isi tarah, lakhanpal ko daliton ke bich se is dar ko bhi dur karnaa he ki bijepi keval rajputon kii pakshdhar nahin he
 He told NDTV, 'we need to sit together with the two communities, we need to be free from all kinds of tensions and ensure that they can live in peace in the future

 Pundhir asks, 'how can we stay calm', and his voice gets emotional while saying this
 lakhanpal rajputon ko aashwast karte hai ki unhone police se nishpaksh jaanch karne ko kaha he
 He said, 'I have told the police that whoever is guilty should not be spared but nobody should be accused of wrongdoing
 ' Similarly, Lakhanpal has to overcome the fear among the Dalits that the BJP is not the only favor of the Rajputs

 After the crushing defeat of the Congress in Rajasthan, there is a crisis in the existence of the party in the Assembly
 loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle congress ke varisht vidhayak ne mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje se mulaakaat kar party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par hamalaa bol diya he
 Along with this, three more mlas have threatened to leave the party
 do vidhayak bhi kam hue to rajya main koi bhi vipaksh nahin rahegaa
 Congress MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma from Sardarshahar in Rajasthan has been continuously lighting fire against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi after meeting Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 rajya ke varisht netaaon par tikat bechney kaa aarope lagaate hue sharma ne kaha he ki june main rajya main congress kii vipaksh kii haisiyat khatm ho jaaegi
 The Congress has 21 mlas in the state and there should be at least 20 mlas in the 200-member assembly to form the opposition
 sharma kaa daawa he ki unke saath paanch vidhayak hai or june main vidhansabha shuru hote hi congress tut jaaegi
 Bhanwarlal Sharma says, "see after June, we will end the recognition of the opposition
 We have five mlas who are upset with the party's functioning
 Our prime ministerial candidate gives a 6-minute speech
 We are not disappointed
 khud amethi main to vidhayak nahin jeeta pate hamen kya jitaayenge
 'the situation is that despite the attack on sonia-rahul, the Congress is nervous about taking action on the MLA
 udhar karauli-dhaulpur ke congress vidhayak girraj malinga, ramesh meena or pradhyumna singh ne bhi congress main tikat bantwaare ko lekar virodh kiya he
 On the other hand state party president Sachin Pilot is sitting in Delhi doing politics of the state with remote control and there is no one to handle this crisis in the party
 party kah rahi he ki party main koi sankat nahin he or baagi vidhayak ke khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa darj karaayaa jayega
 Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma says that Bhanwar Lal Sharma is making false statements and talking about defamation, action will be taken against those who are saying that there are four to five mlas with them, it is not like that all should be united in Congress
 agar ye vidhayak party chhodte hai to rajasthan ke itihaas main yah pehla mauka hoga jab vidhansabha main koi vipaksh nahin rahegaa
 The condition of the Congress in the state is that whether Sachin Pilot or former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot or Congress General Secretary CP Joshi, no one wants to contest elections

 — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)may 28, 2018marathi cinema main aae hai kai badlaavamaadhuri ne haal hi main ek intervyuu main marathi cinema main debyue karne kii khaas vajah bataai
 He said, if you want to try your luck in Marathi cinema then you should come to Marathi
 agar aapako nahin aati he to aapako hindi cinema kaa hi rukh karnaa hoga
 He further added, with this, Marathi films did not have the same charm as it is today
 yah aaj adhik viksit or yuvaaon ke liye adhik aakarshak he
 Technically speaking, its production values are not less than Hindi films
 unhone kaha ki 'natsamraat', 'court' or 'sarat jaisi filmein baniin or unhone paridrishy ko badla
 Years later, 'I walked away
 
 
 ’ kii dhun par maadhuri-renuka kaa dance, videomadhuri ne bollywood main kariyar kii shuruyaat karne ke sawaal par jawaab diya ki mere maamle main sabase pehle mujhe abhinetri banane kii koi chaah nahin thi
 i was happy with my dance and acting, studies and everything in school dramas
 filmein mere liye ek ghatana jaisi hai, isliye maine abhi hindi filmon ke saath shuruyaat kii or aisa karnaa jari rakhaa
 Madhuri did many female-centric films in 1990, but according to her the definition of that genre has now changed
 mahila pradhan kirdaaron ko lekar badali he maansiktounhone kaha, "mujhe lagata he ki lekhak hamaare puraane dinon kii tulana main aaj mahilaon ko behatar samajhate hai
 So they are creating a much better character for us
 mujhe lagata he ki mahila-kendrit cinema kii paribhaasha ab badal gai he or yah ham sabhi ke liye bahut dilachasp he
 Madhuri, referring to her career, said, "I am lucky that i get different characters at the beginning of my career, whether it is acid or heart and son
" unhone kaha, "aaj ke lekhan main mahila kirdaaron kaa str maansik taur par majboot hota he
 The characters are closer to reality
 maadhuri philhal 'kalank' or 'total dhamal' kii shooting main vyast hai
 After the High Court rebuke, the Delhi government has become conscious about air pollution in the national capital
 aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne aanan-fanan main pradooshan ko kam karne ke liye kai faisle bhi liye hai, jinamein sabake adhik charchaa sam or visham sankhya vaale kaaron ke parichaalan ko lekar he
 The government has imported this rule from Beijing and is giving an example of its success there, while it is also necessary to know on what basis this rule was implemented in the capital of China and then successful
 darasal, beijing mensam or visham sankhya vaale numberonse miltaa-julata niyam 2008 main lagu hua tha
 But it is also worth noting that the government and administration there not only changed many levels before and after doing this, but also made it successful
 kam se kam do staron par china ne vah kiya, jo kisi bhi puraane tantra ko anshat: yaa purnat: khatm karne ke liye jaruri hota he, yani ek vyavhaarik vikalp
 Developed and strengthened sub-way and bus network
 The biggest question on the implementation of this rule is that if people do not drive their car three days a week, how will it work? kyonki offis se lekar rosemara ke saikadon kaam ke liye lakhon gaadiyaan har din sadakon par utarati hai
 That is, the need is a better and stronger option
 beijing ne isi ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sabase pehle apane public transport system ko na sirf majboot kiya, balki uskaa vistaar bhi
 With the increase in bus trips in Beijing, the number of buses was also almost doubled
 yahi nahin, metro kii tarj par vahaan sab-ve kaa vistaar kiya gaya
 Within a few years, the metro expanded there to 600 km, which is double that of the Delhi Metro
 yani agar chaar chakkon ko sadakon par utarane se rokna he to chah chakkon yani yani bason kii sankhya badhaani hogi
 The number of metro trains will have to be increased, the number of coaches in trains currently running will have to increase and the route will have to be expanded on a war footing
 samajhnaa hoga, gaadiyaan badhin to kyonek saadhaaran si samaj kii baat he ki log aamtaur par gaadiyaan kharidte kyon he
 If you separate the status symbol, the answer is given directly to save public transport congestion and time
 to yaheen se dilli sarkaar ke liye doosraa bada sawaal khadaa hota he
 For example, the crowds of buses are clearly visible on the roads, so traveling in the Delhi Metro and especially in the time of commuting to the office becomes a situation like gorilla war
 yahaan yah baat bhi gaur karne laayak he ki metro main 6 dibbon kii bajaay 8 dibbon kii baat bhi har root par har gaadi ke saath abhi tak puri ho nahin saki he
 On the lines of Beijing, the surveillance system is more important than any rule announcement
 beijing main is ore prashasan ne jo duusari badi kavayad kii, vah servilans system ko lekar he
 In fact, on a large scale, a network of surveillance cameras were laid on the roads to help the traffic police
 ye camere sadak kii dekhbhaal karte hai or kisi bhi niyam ke tuutane par ulanghan karne vaale ke naam sidhe 200 yuan (kareeb 2000 rupee) kaa parchaa katkar uske khate main jod dete hai
 If someone ignores the rules on the same day again and again, they have to pay for each bar first, while the license is canceled if the rules are broken more than the number of occasions
 dilachasp he ki yah puraa system automatic he
 That is, you broke the rules here, there was a penalty added to the account
 to kya arvind kejariwal kii sarkaar beijing se niyam emport karne ke saath hi vahaan maujuuda vyavastha ko bhi aayaat karegi
 China has endured the discussions and concerns that people have bought about two-two carts - odd number rule in India today
 safal hone ke baavjood vahaan is niyam ko lekar kuch nae chalan bhi chal pade
 For example, the rich bought two vehicles each
 iskaa asar yah hua ki shahar main har saal gadiyon kii sankhya badhane lagi
 As a result, traffic jam started coming in and traffic was disrupted for 11 days in 2010
 iske baad beijing main car kharidne ke liye lottery system kii vyavastha kii gai
 Today, the Beijing Traffic Authority allows only 17,600 vehicles to be purchased in a year
 dilli main kya hai vaastavik halaatarashtriya rajdhani kii baat karen to yahaan dilli metro kii kul 216 trainen roj daudti hai, jinamein 1,282 coach hai
 These trains make 2800 trips every day and about 25 lakh passengers board every day
 isi tarah shahar main philhal kul 4700 ditisi kii basen hai, jo din main 40 hajaar trip lagaati hai or inamen 45 lakh log savaar hote hai
 On the other hand, the number of private cars and jeeps in Delhi is 27,08,273, while there are 27,15,297 scooters and 28,61595 motorcycles
 rajdhani main commercial gadiyon kii sankhya 3,56,821 he, jabaki kul privet gadiyon kii sankhya 84,75,371 he
 Former army chief VK Singh's call for dissolution of Parliament and siege has sparked a debate as to whether a man led by an army of 1
3 million soldiers should make such a demand for the highest institutions of democracy
 wike singh ne haal hi main kathith taur par pehle sansad bhang karne or phir ganna kisaanon ke samarthan main iske gheraav ke liye kaha tha
 His own predecessors and colleagues have expressed mixed reactions to these statements
 unke purvavarti deepak kapur ne kaha, purv sena pramukh kaa is tarah kii gatividhiyon main lipt hona uchit nahin he
 The serving people see him as the former army chief and such things are not right
 wike singh ke purvavarti ne kaha, sansad hamaare loktantr kaa sarvocch nikaay he

 Another former army chief, General VP Malik, said that there is nothing legally wrong in what VK Singh is doing, but as far as he is concerned, it is not fair for him on issues related to justification
 general malik ne ek tivi channel se kaha, saarvajanik rup se kuch bhi kehete samay puri tarah satark rahanaa chahie, kyonki iskaa asar sevarat logon par pad saktaa he

 The farmers' body is planning to lay siege to Parliament on 4 December
 jab general wike singh se poocha gaya ki kya vah andolan main bhaag lenge, to unhone kaha ki shaayad vah bhaag le sakate hai
 He said, when we reach there we will go further
 
 
 ham dekhenge ki waisi sthiti aegi yaa nahin

 Increase awareness of the common man about the environment, whether in the last four-five years, there may be a case of pollution in Delhi, a case of the lake being eroded due to pollution in Bengaluru, the case of Shri Sri Ravi Shankar's World Cultural Festival on the Yamuna coast
 Or there is a decision to stop vehicles coming from outside the capital from construction work to reduce continuous pollution

 NGT chairman Swatanter Kumar played an important role in taking such decisions
 vivaadit rahe NGT ke kuch faislehaalanki engiti ke kuch faisle vivaadit bhi rahe
 Just like Amarnath Kolekar was recently given the decision of the NGT or the decision of the NGT to include two wheelers in the odd-even
 kuch aise faisle bhi rahe jin par engiti kii aalochana hui or kuch aise bhi rahe jo behad saraahe gaye
 The NGT continued to operate fully and impartially

 NGT has been the only tribunal in the country that has questioned or put a stay on many projects of the government
 lihaaja chif justise swatantra kumaar ke jane ke baad ye dekhnaa ahm hoga ki paryaavaran ko lekar sarkaar or samaaj engiti ke kitne aadesh ko aage gambhirtha se lenge

 The AUF is going to celebrate its 116th anniversary on 30 March

 The stadium was used for the first World Cup matches in Montevideo
 jiyani ko shuukravaar ko fifa kaa adhyaksh chunaa gaya tha

 The same Sharma Uncle, whose Mrs

 threatens to come to the door every fourth day with a bowl of sugar
 samasya sharma ji se yaa sharmine antee ke shakkar maangane se nahin he
 The problem is with Sharma ji's boy
 gharavaalon ko akhil vishwa, sakal brahmad or sampoorn maanavjaati main ek sharma ji kaa ladkaa hi laayak najar aata he
 The result used to be good for him and the sound of dhoom-dhadak-chatak echoed in our homes, after years suddenly the voice of Sharma ji's boy was awakened again
 rohit sharma ke dhaihare shatak ne srilanka ko aisa haraaya ki kaiyon ke ghar se ‘sharmaji ke ladke ko dekhaor khud ko dekh nalayak!” sunai diya
 It is not that the nickname 'sharma' has only added charas in your or Sri Lankan players' lives
 do ‘sharmaaon’ ne to milakar viraat kohli kii jindagi badal di
 Here we are not talking about Ishant Sharma
 kal ko sachin kii tarj par viraat bhi aatmakatha likhen to uskaa naam ‘two sharma’s of my life’ yaa ‘I had two sharma’ ho saktaa he
 However, this is not the first time Rohit Sharma has avenged the jokes built on himself on social networking sites from the bowlers of the opposition team

 Sadly, Sri Lankan bowlers had to bear the brunt of his statement
 rohit sharma kaa doharaa shatak puraa hote hi sophia hayaat ne kapade utaar phenke
 Seeing his silhouetted body, it was suspected at first that he was anxious to get rid of the remains of yesterday's pulses, but later it was also revealed that he is following in the footsteps of Poonam Pandey, the founder of Twitter
 jaise hi news channels par sophia hayaat ke neude hone kii news ai
 Also, the secret of lost form between Rohit Sharma was also revealed
 bakaul rohit sharma, sophia unase pehle bhi achche ran banane par kapade utaar kar photo khinchane kii baat kah chuki thim
 Due to this fear, often they are unable to score even after wanting

 (young satirist Ashish Mishra is an engineer by profession and lives in Indore
 ) The BJP has adopted an aggressive attitude over the Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde's statement of 'hindu terrorism' and demanded that Congress President Sonia Gandhi break the silence and act on Shinde
 aaj bijepi deshbhar main is mudde ko lekar sadakon par utari hui he
 During the protest at Delhi's Jantar Mantar, party president Rajnath Singh made it clear that if Shinde is not dismissed, the upcoming session of Parliament will not be allowed to run
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki scindia kaa bayaan bijepi kaa apmaan karne vaala he or unhen turant barkhaast kiya jaae
 Sushma Swaraj said, saffron and terror are antonyms

 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko bhi maafee maangani chahie or scindia ko barkhaast kiya janaa chahie
 When the Congress later disassociated itself from Shinde's statement, Sushma said that the Congress always pretended to separate itself from the controversial statements of its government
 vipaksh kii netaa ne kaha ki bharat ke viruddh aatanki shivi chalaa rahe pakistan kii khabar lene kii bajaay grahamantri desh ke mukhya vipakshi dal par aise aarope laga kar prahaar kar rahe hai
 He said that after the Pakistani army beheaded the Indian soldier after killing him, he called the National Security Advisor and told him to inform the Prime Minister that in the light of this barbaric incident, the government would be against the neighboring country if If he takes strong action, the opposition will fully support him
 bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne kaha ki agar scindia ko barkhaast nahin kiya jaataa he, to unki party sansad ke aagaamee satr ke dauraan donon sadanon main yah maang karti rahegi
 Rajnath Singh said, Congress leaders term jamaat-ud-dawa chief Hafiz Saeed as 'sahab' and Al Qaeda leader as 'osamaji'
 isse saaf he ki congress na to aatankwaad se ladane ke liye gambhir he or na hi desh ko is buraai se bachaane main
 The BJP president said that Shinde's statement has affected India's image around the world
 
 
 
 Sonia Gandhi's silence on the issue shows that she thinks it will strengthen her vote bank
 unhone kaha, scindia ko janaa hoga, koi takat unhen bachaa nahin sakati he
 Shinde had said at a recent Congress conference in Jaipur that the BJP and the Sangh run Hindu terrorist training camps
 baad main unhone spashtikaran diya ki unhone hindu nahin bhagava kaha tha
 a few days later, the Congress disassociated itself from Shinde's statement that it does not see terrorism linked to any religion
 tippaniyan On the other hand, a petition has also been filed against the Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde in the Saket Court of Delhi
 yachikakarta kaa kahana he ki scindia ke bayaan se hinduon kii bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchaa he or isse samudaayon ke bich nafrat fail sakati he
 The petition also said that Shinde's statement was given only to attract the minority vote bank for the 2014 elections

 Today, the BJP has taken to the streets across the country on this issue
 dilli ke jantar-mantar par pradarshan ke dauraan party adhyaksh rajnath singh ne saaf kar diya ki yadi scindia ko barkhaast nahin kiya gaya, to sansad kaa aagaamee satr nahin chalane diya jayega
 Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said that Shinde's statement is insulting to BJP and he should be sacked immediately
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha, bhagava or aatank aapas main viparitarthak shabd hai
 The Home Minister should withdraw his statement and apologize
 
 
 
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should also apologize and Shinde should be sacked
 congress dwaara baad main scindia ke bayaan se apane ko alag karne par sushamaa ne kaha ki congress hameshaa apni sarkaar ke vivaadaaspad bayanon se khud kaa alag karne kaa naatak karti he
 The Leader of the Opposition said that instead of taking news of Pakistan running a terrorist camp against India, the Home Minister is attacking the main opposition party of the country by making such allegations
 unhone kaha ki pakistan sena dwaara bhartiya sainik kii hatya ke baad uskaa sir dhad se alag karne par unhone rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ko phone karke unase kaha tha ki vah pradhanmantri ko suchit kar den ki is barbar ghatana ke alok main sarkaar ukt padosi desh ke khilaaf agar kadi karrwai karti he, to vipaksh uskaa puraa samarthan karegaa
 BJP president Rajnath Singh said that if Shinde is not sacked, his party will continue to demand this in both houses during the upcoming session of Parliament
 rajnath singh ne kaha, congress ke netaa jamaat-ud-daawa ke pramukh hafiz said ko 'sahab' or al kaayda ke netaa ko 'osamaji' kahkar mukhaatib karte hai
 It is clear that the Congress is neither serious about fighting terrorism nor in protecting the country from this evil
 bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha ki scindia ke bayaan se vishvabhar main bharat kii chhavi prabhavit hui he
 
 
 
 is mudde par sonia gandhi kii khamoshi darshaati he ki unhen lagata he ki isse unka vot bank or majboot hoga
 He said, Shinde has to go, no power can save him
 scindia ne haal main jaipur main yojit congress ke sammelan main kaha tha ki bijepi or sangh hindu aatanki prashikshan shivi chalaate hai
 He later clarified that he called saffron and not Hindu
 kuch din baad congress ne scindia ke bayaan se apane ko alag karte hue kaha ki vah aatankwaad ko kisi dharm se jodakar nahin dekhati
 The comments udhar, kendriya grahamantri susheel kumaar scindia ke khilaaf dilli kii saket court main yachika bhi daayar kii gai he
 The petitioner says that Shinde's statement has hurt the sentiments of Hindus and may lead to hatred among the communities
 yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki scindia kaa bayaan sirf or sirf 2014 ke chunaavon ke liye mynurity vot bank ko apni taraf aakarshith karne ke liye diya gaya he
 Now the matter will be heard on Monday 28 January

" ” Quote by “thich nhan hanh”a post shared bysunny Leone(@sunnyleone) onfeb 11, 2019 at 1:56am pstview this post on instagram'the never-ending wait for you'a post shared bysunny Leone(@sunnyleone) onfeb 9, 2019 at 5:37am pstsani ne saal 2011 main danniel webar se shaadi kii thi
 He has also worked in Bollywood films
 bataa den ki saal 2019 main sani multistarar kamedi film total dhamal main najar aaengi
 In the year 2018, Sunny was in the discussion due to the biopic being made on her
 web siries ke rup main ise pesh kiya gaya jise logon ke achche rivyuu mili
 The web series depicts the struggles of Sunny's life and his childhood
 tripura main 25 saal puraani vam satta ko ukhaad phenkane vaale bijepi ke rajya prabharee sunil devdhar ne kaha ki rajya main sanghathan khadaa karne ke liye unhone khud par bahut kaam kiya
 Even changed their food habits
 tripura aakar pork khaanaa shuru kiya
 He said, BJP did this charisma only with the weapon of Congress, which Congress itself could never do
 rajya kaa maujuuda bijepi sanghathan 90% congress or trinmul kaaryakartaaon se hi ban paaya
 However, he completely rejected that BJP compromised ideology in Tripura for power
 rajya main jeet ke do din baadagujtak
 In a special conversation with in, Sunil Deodhar talked about all such issues which were not yet revealed
 unhone bijepi kii jeet kaa saxes formula bhi bataaya
 Let's read the edited excerpts of the detailed conversation, know what Sunil's Tripura Success Formula did, what the Congress could not do for 25 years
 
 
 kya tripura main bijepi kii aisi jeet kaa bharosa tha?devdhar:tripura main aisi jeet kaa mujhe bilkul bharosa nahin tha
 When Amit Bhai called me home and entrusted me with the responsibility, i also questioned him
 main kaise kar paaungaa? unhone kaha, mujhe aap par puraa bharosa he
 i reached Tripura after party instructions
 6 maheene rahaa to maine mahasoos kiya ki logon main dar he or log badlaav bhi chaahate hai
 The Left had been in power in the state for many years
 uske khilaaf congress (vipaksh) ne jameen par kuch nahin kiya tha
 How to start an organization in the state? Deodhar: The first thing i started to do to increase the party's campaign in Tripura was to wear a muffler of tribes, that is, a swap
 hamane is tarah kii bahut si choti-choti chijen kii
 Such things help a lot
 agartala main ek adivasee netaa ne mujhase kaha bhi- 'jaanate hai devdhar ji ham aapako kyon pasand karte hai
 Despite being the Chief Minister for many years, Manik Sarkar did not put this swag on his shoulder
 par aapane aate hi kiya
 'how did you work on yourself to make the party strong? Deodhar: i never had a win or win in my mind
 yahaan log mujhe apana samajhen, ye meraa mukhya makasad tha
 i changed my food to Habit
 haalanki main nonvej pehle se khaataa tha par maine pork khaanaa tripura main hi shuru kiya (yahaan ke samaaj main pork khaaya jaataa he)
 Coming from Maharashtra, it was not easy to do all this here
 kya pork khaanaa chunavi ranneeti kaa hissaa tha?devdhar:aisa nahin he
 It was not for winning elections
 mujhe kabhi haar yaa jeet kii phikr nahin thi
 i did this to build the organization
 main sangh main prachaarak rahaa hum
 We have been taught that ‘yasmin Deshe Yadachara’
 
 
 ' yani jahaan aap jaaenge vahaan ke reeti-rivaaj main ghulmil kar rahenge to atmiyata ho jaati he
 Affinity increases
 khud par or kis tarah kaam karnaa padaa, aisi koi baat jo bataanaa chahen?devdhar:main yahaan aane se pehle thodi bahut bengali jaanata tha, lekin yahaan aane ke baad maine us par achche se kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 i hired a tutor to learn Bengali
 roj mehnat kii
 Bengali used to listen to songs
 janajaatiy bhashaa seekhney ke liye bhi alag tutor rakhaa, haalanki yah aniyamit tha
 Also placed translator
 jo devanagari script main janajaatiy bhashaa main spich translet karke detaa tha
 These things helped a lot in connecting with people
 jis vakt aapane abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii desh main bif par bahes ho rahi thi, kya khan-paan ko lekar tripura main is tarah ke sawaal se saamana hua?devdhar:bif ko lekar desh main jari dibet kaa tripura main koi asar nahin dikhaa
 We were just protesting against the illegal smuggling of animals from Bangladesh
 tripura main 90 pratishat hindu hai or wo bif nahin khate
 The CPM definitely propagated among Muslims
 lekin mjedaar baat yah he ki is rajya main doodh kii baari kami thi
 Powdered milk is used here
 jo kaaphi nuksaandeh he
 Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Communists - all children need milk
 tripura main doodh ke liye go sanvardhan karne kaa faisla rajya kii vam sarkaar kaa nirnay he
 After the victory, there are allegations that the BJP did not compromise the ideology for power
 ek tarah se log ise bijepi kii haar bhi bataa rahe hai?devdhar:kisi sanghathan kaa alag rajya kii maang karnaa koi desh virodh nahin he
 Those we aligned with have demanded a separate state
 unke aatanki hone yaa aise sanghathanon se sambandh kaa koi aadhaar nahin hai
 These are just allegations
 hamane unako manaaya
 We explained that with the demand for a separate state, come with us
 adivaasiyon kaa utthan karen
 These people (opposition) do not have the right to speak on terrorism
 hamaari drushti main alag rajya kii maang anpractical he par kanstitutional bilkul nahin
 We tried to reduce the segregation there, CPM wanted to increase it
 yah prachaarit kiya ki bijepi isaayiyon ke khilaaf he
 But we got their vote here too
 isai bijepi ke khilaaf nahin hai
 How do you see bjp's victory in Tripura in other parts of the country? Deodhar: bjp's break in the north-east is a big thing
 deshbhar main bahut positive massej jayega
 The victory of the Left over Tripura has also been celebrated in Kerala and West Bengal

 The Congress took on the BJP and said that BJP mps cheated the public
 congress ne bhaajapa ko aade haathon liya or kaha ki bhaajapa ne janata ko haseen sapane dikhaae, lekin ek bhi vaada puraa nahin kiya
 Therefore, the people of Delhi will give a befitting reply to the BJP in the coming Lok Sabha elections

 The MP from Delhi is missing from his constituency
 ham unki shikaayat chunaav ayog se karenge ki 5 saal gumshuda rahe saansadon ko dhund kar laayaa jaae

 Due to festivals and annual closures, there are many holidays in the banks this month and next month which are opposed by businessmen, brokers, business organizations

 Assocham said in a statement that the Reserve Bank should intervene so that it asks the banks to make some arrangements
 desh main zyaadaatar bank sarkari hai or vitt mantralay ko bhi isamen hastkshep karnaa chahie
 This will also cause a lot of trouble for the general public
 haalanki in avasaron par atm khule rahete hai lekin desh main unki haalat utani acchhee bhi nahin he
 Apart from this, when banks are closed on holidays, atms are also empty and people have to face lack of funds

 They have to work hard to send their goods

 collingwood ne kaha, isse kaam ban gaya or unhone kaha, thik he, main ummid karti hum ki ab aap jeetoge
 The death of Rohit Shekhar Tiwari, son of late ND Tiwari, a veteran Congress leader has been revealed
 jaisaa ki mana ja rahaa tha
 The murderer left the house
 wo bhi koi or nahin balki rohit kii patni apurva
 When the police began to investigate the case of Rohit's death, the needle of police suspicion turned towards Rohit's wife Apoorva
 lekin ab katl ke raaj se pardaa uth chukaa he
 But a question is in front of everyone, under what circumstances Apurva became a murderer? The fight to get the rights: Rohit Shekhar and his mother Ujjwala Sharma fought a long battle to get their rights from the late leader Narayan Dutt Tiwari
 saal 2014 main unhen us ladaai kaa fal mila
 ND Tiwari adopted Rohit as his son and married Ujjwala Sharma in Lucknow
 ab maa-bete kii jindagi main chal rahaa tufaan tham chukaa tha
 The lives of both of them were returning to the track now
 aise mili the rohit or apurvaujjwala bete ke liye sundar susheel ladki talash rahi thim
 Meanwhile, in the year 2017, Rohit saw Apoorva's profile at a metromonial site
 rohit ne maa ko bataaya or phir donon ne milane kaa faisla kiya
 After this, both met for the first time in Lucknow in 2017
 donon ke bich dosti ho gai
 Rohit was in love with Apoorva
 is mulaakaat ke baad donon kareeb aa gaye
 Then both started living in live in relationship
 dilli main hui thi donon kii shaadidonon ko saath rahete hue saal bhar biit chukaa tha
 The mother was also waiting for the son's marriage
 lihaaja 12 may 2018 ko rohit or apurva ne shaadi kar lee thi
 The wedding took place at a five star hotel in Delhi
 jisamen kai bade netaa or adhikari shaamil hue the
 Mother Ujjwala was very happy
 rohit or apurva bhi is rishte ke puure ho jane se utsahit the
 Apoorva's entire family was present at the wedding
 pati-patni or 'wo'shaadi ke baad dilli kii dephence colony main apurva apane pati rohit shekhar ke saath rahane lagi thi
 Both of their families were frozen
 lekin zyada dinon tak sab thik nahin rahaa
 In this story 'wo' was entered
 shaadi kaa ek saal bhi puraa nahin hua tha ki apurva ko rohit kii ek mahila mitra ke bare main pataa chalaa, jo ki unki rishtedaar thi
 The rivalry between them started growing
 rohit aksar us mahila se milane jaataa tha
 Apoorva did not accept this
 maayke waalon ke liye ghar kii mangarohit or apurva ke rishte main daraar kii keval yahi vajah nahin thi
 Rather, having property somewhere or other became a problem for Rohit
 police chaanbin ke mutabik apurva ne rohit se uske gharavaalon ke liye ek ghar banavaane kii maang kii thi
 But Rohit always ignored his point
 is baat ko lekar bhi donon ke bich kahasuni hone lagi thi
 Ujjwala has also filed a statement in this regard with the police
 maayke chali gai thi apurvashadi ke kuch maheenon main hi donon kaa rishta bikharane laga tha
 Rohit continued to meet the woman
 pichley maah donon ke bich maamla itnaa badha ki apurva kareeb ek maah ke liye apane maayke chali gai thi
 She returned to Rohit about two weeks before the incident
 talaak tak pahunch gai thi batarohit kii maa ujjwala ne bataaya ki rohit or uski patni apurva ke bich pichley kuch samay se talaak kii baat chal rahi thi
 Whenever there was a quarrel, there was talk about it
 talaak ko lekar kai baar charchaa hone ke baad yah tay hua tha ki is par june main faisla hoga
 mian-biwi also had a fight last month
 jhagade ke baad 3 se 29 march tak apurva apane maayke main rahi thi
 After this, Apoorva came back to Defense Colony on 30 March
 video kol ke baad hua bavaalisi dauraan 11 april uttarakhand main loksabhaa chunaav tha
 Rohit was supposed to go there to cast his vote
 jab rohit vahaan gaya to bataaya gaya ki wo apni mahila mitra ko bhi saath le gaya tha
 Apurva did not know this thing
 lekin isi bich ek aisi ghatana hui, jisane rohit or apurva ke bich ek badi lakeer khinch di
 It happened that when Rohit Shekhar was in Uttarakhand to cast his vote
 usee bich apurva ne rohit ko video kol kii
 In which Apoorva was seen with the woman Rohit
 ve donon sharaab pi rahe the
 It is also believed that both were in objectionable condition and Rohit had received a drunk call
 15 april ko laute the rohitis ghatana ke baad apurva kaa gussa saatven aasmaan par ja pahunchaa tha
 On the phone too, there was an argument between the two
 apurva bahut niraash thi
 Perhaps he never thought that Rohit would change this way after marriage
 15 april ko rohit lautakar waapas ghar aayaa
 That night Rohit's defense colony was in the house of the colony Rohit's wife Apoorva, elder brother Siddharth Sharma, maid Martha, servant Golu, driver Akhilesh
 dinar ke baad ain thim marohit kii maa kaa ek sarkari ghar tilak len main bhi he
 She lives there too
 15 april kii raat rohit kii maa ujjwala sharma bhi rohit ke dephence colony vaale is ghar main ai thim
 But after dinner, she went back home to Tilak Lane from here
 ujjwala ke mutabik us raat rohit ko jab unhone dekha to wo thik-thaak tha
 Just looked a little drunk
 15 april, somvaar, raat 10 bajerohit kii maa ujjwala kii maane to jab wo vahaan pahunchi thim, tab rohit living room main nahin tha
 When he asked Rohit's wife Apoorva, he told that Rohit is tired and sleeping in his room
 haalanki kuch hi der baad rohit neeche chalaa aayaa or dinar ke baad apni maa ko unki car main bithaane ke baad phir se sone chalaa gaya tha
 According to Rohit's suspect Mautrohit's mother, she came back to the Defense Colony house on April 16 at around 2 pm the next day, while Apoorva told that Rohit is not yet asleep
 iske baad ujjwala driver akhilesh or rajeev ke saath maiks aspataal chali gayi
 But she had just reached the gate of the hospital that about 4
 30 baje ujjwala ke purv karmchaaree ramesh kaa kol aayaa or usne bataaya ki rohit kii tabiyat bighad gai he
 When Ujjwala reached home with an ambulance herself, Apoorva was lying in the car with her husband Rohit
 magar phir ambulance se rohit ko aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Where doctors declared him dead
 postmortem report ne badali kahanerohit kii achaanak maut se ghar vaale hairaan to the, par sabko yahi laga ki maut natural he
 But three days later, when the post mortem report came, the whole story was overturned
 19 april ko ai postmortem report main kaha gaya ki rohit kii maut dam ghutane se hui he
 There are also marks on the throat
 shaq jataayaa gaya ki rohit kaa munh or galaa dabaaya gaya hoga
 While in the report, the time of death was told between one and half hour
 apurva samet naukaron se hui thi poochtachamamala jaanch padtaal shuru ho chuki thi
 The police visited Rohit's room on the spot
 saboot jutaney kii koshish kii ja rahi thi
 CCTV footage was being searched
 ghar ke apurva samet naukaron ko milakar kul 6 log police ke radar par the
 The investigation of the case was handed over to the Delhi Crime Branch
 poochtacha main pataa chalaa ki vaardaat se pehle rohit or apurva ke bich jhagada hua tha
 Rohit was intoxicated at that time
 apurva badalati rahi bayankrime branch kii team apurva se poochtacha karti rahi
 She continued to be unaware of this incident
 apurva ne is bare main jaankaree naa hone kii baat kahi
 He just told that Rohit was sleeping in the room
 wo ek baar kamare main gai thi
 But she kept changing her statements constantly
 isi vajah se us par police kaa shaq gaharaa gaya tha
 It was then discovered that that night Rohit and Apoorva had a fight with Rohit's same female friend, with whom Apoorva saw Rohit drinking alcohol
 khatm ho gai rohit kii kahaneisi dauraan police ne apurva ke nakhunon or baalo kaa namoonay liye or jaanch ke liye bhej die
 The crime branch was adding episodes one after the other
 sample positive paae gaye or apurva ke saamne sach bolne ke alaava koi chaara nahin rahaa
 He then told the police that the night of the murder, there was a fight between Apoorva and Rohit first and then a scuffle ensued
 rohit nashe kii haalat main tha
 So Apoorva overshadowed him
 usne rohit kaa galaa dabaakar use maut ke ghat utaar diya
 After committing the crime, she tried to erase the evidence and then went to her room to sleep
 is tarah se is kahani or rohit shekhar tiwari kaa ant ho gaya
 The entry of 'that' between the husband and wife, wrote a creepy tale of murder and the infidelity of the husband made his wife slayer
 uniwarsity grant kamishan (ujisi) ne dystence mod ke kuch corcej par roak laga di he
 The UGC in its last meeting has decided on this basis

 He said that Khurshid does not say anything wrong
 khurshid ne aaj tak se khaas baatcheet main kaha, 'mujhe bataa den, kya shabd istemaal karen
 Someone says a murderer
 maine nahin kaha
 i want to say meraa ye maananaa he ki jisko lekar ham kah saken ki modi ji kii nijee jimmedaari he
 He had a personal obligation

 'khurshid said,' They should accept the responsibility of the events that happened in Gujarat during Modi's CM, whether Godhra incident or after it
 yaa phir wo kahe ki ham asahaay ho gaye hai, kuch nahin kar paae
 So what is the word for that
 isse behatar ho to bataaen
 The term is used which is used daily in the Hindi language
 'videsh mantri ne apane shabdon kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki unhone to ek saamaanya shabd kaa istemaal kiya he, lekin yadi bijepi ke netaa uske galat matlab nikaalte hai to ve jaane
 Khurshid said, 'if he is giving any other reference, then he should apologize
 jaanch karaaen is bare main
 BJP leaders will know
 unhone modi ji ke bare main kya sochaa or samajha he
 If his views are such that he should apologize, then he should ask

 Those people should decide that what the murderer says is right
 yaa jo napunsak kahata he vah sahi he

 Our campaign is not Modi centric
 jo gujarat main hua, jo unka record he, vah uski prashansa karte hai, to ham jawaab dete hai

 Abhishek Mishra has been making videos on youtube for a long time, which are quite popular

 Noted astrologer and religious teacher Dati Maharaj has been absconding ever since he was accused of rape with one of his disciples
 lekin 'ajtak' daati maharaj se sampark karne main safal rahaa
 In the interview given to Aaj Tak, Dati Madan Maharaj has put forward a new theory about this whole incident
 daati maharaj kii maane, to vah is maamle main na sirf beqasoor hai, balki iske peeche unheen ke chelon kii rupee-paison ko lekar chal rahi andruni ladaai he, jisamen vah buree tarah se ulajh gaye hai
 Although Dati Maharaj, who describes himself as innocent, has been hiding from the police
 haalanki daati maharaj ne khud hi police ke paas jane baat kahi he
 He said, 'I am not a fugitive
 court tay kare doshi hum yaa nirdosh
 The truth will be revealed soon
 rape kii tarikhon kii jaanch karuunga
 i was being threatened
 doshi hum to faansee de do
 However, Dati Maharaj admitted that he knew the disciple who accused him of rape
 unhone kaha, 'haa main us ladki ko jaanata hum
 It is being made a shield
 main saikadon betiyon kaa pita hum
 'dati Maharaj told the conspiracy of a disciple named Sachin behind all this
 unhone kaha, 'yah sabhi samvidhan se jude hue log hai, pichley kai saalon se aa rahe hai
 They had a mutual transaction
 sachin ne mujh par paise dene ke liye dabaav daalaa
 If i could not give it, he even threatened to ruin me
 mujhe apane raashtra par vishwaas tha ki main acha kaam kar rahaa hum or raashtra mere saath he
 At the same time, Dati Maharaj also admits that his own disciple succeeded in plotting against him
 udhar dilli main search warrant jari hone ke baad police ne daati maharaj ke ashram par chapa daalaa or ashram main rah rahe logon se poochtacha kii
 The crime branch has already issued a lookout notice against Dati Maharaj to prevent him from running out of the country
 iske saath hi ab krime branch daati maharaj se poochtacha kii taiyaari bhi kar rahi he
 But Dati Maharaj is still out of police custody
 court ne jari kiya search warrantdilli kii saket court ne balaatkaar ke aaropon se ghire daati maharaj ke khilaaf search warrant jari kiya he
 Actually, ever since his disciple lodged an FIR for rape on Dati Maharaj, he is absconding
 saket court ke duty magistrate ke search warrant jari karne ke baad dilli police ne daati maharaj ke ashram kii talaashi bhi le lee he
 After 2 years, a rape case was filed, a week ago, a student of his daughter has filed an FIR alleging rape

 1- Did you think of resigning after the dismal results of Lok Sabha elections? Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath said that he did not think about resigning after the defeat in the state
 kamalnath ne kaha ki unhone 25 disambar ko mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee thi or kaam karne ke liye 75 din hi mili uske baad loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar aachaar samhita lagu ho gai
 Kamal Nath said, i think that in 75 days the work that we did was not done in any state
 kamalnath ne kaha ki agar teen-chaar saal kaam karne ke baad loksabhaa chunaav ke aise nattejey aate to main istife ke bare main soch saktaa tha lekin abhi istipha dene kaa koi sawaal hi nahin
 2- Did the Congress fail as a national party in the Lok Sabha election results? Kamal Nath said that as the results keep changing, the larger mandate BJP got today will change in the coming times
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki is chunaav main ham jin muddon ke saath chunaav laden vah modi ke naam or unke vaadon kaa muqabla nahin kar paae
 3- What was the result of the decision to waive the debt of the farmers in the election? CM Kamal Nath said that the government decided not to waive the debt of the farmers with the aim of getting good results in the election, rather the first to work for the debt waiver farmers Was the step
 4- kya rahul gandhi ke congress adhyaksh pad se istipha dene kaa faisla sahi he?rahul gandhi ke congress adhyaksh pad se istipha dene ke faisle par kamalnath ne kaha ki unhen congress adhyaksh bane rahanaa chahie
 Kamal Nath said, i believe that Rahul Gandhi should not think about resigning from the post of president after this defeat
 kamalnath ne kaha, bhartiya janata party kaa chunaav abhiyaan congress ke muddon or congress ke theme se puri tarah alag tha or logon ne unke abhiyaan ko swikar kiya
 5- Who is the better alternative to Priyanka Gandhi or non-gandhi Congress? When asked Chief Minister Kamal Nath, if Rahul Gandhi is adamant on his decision to resign from the post of Congress President, then who will be the better option than Priyanka Gandhi and non-gandhi
 is par kamalnath ne kaha ki maine rahul gandhi ke adhyaksh naa bane rahane ke bare main abhi tak sochaa hi nahin he

 chunki tasviir main raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman dikh rahi thim to sabase pehle hamane is viral photo kii sachai jaanane ke liye raksha mantri or raksha mantralay ke aadhikarik twitor handle ko khangala
 There we found the same photo which was posted on 7 November 2018

 ab or jaankaree ke liye hamane sidhaa raksha mantralay kaa rukh kiya or vahaan raksha mantralay ke pravaktaa karnal aman anand se baat kii
 She said that she is not the daughter of Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman but the Indian Army jawan, who was appointed as a liaison officer on the official visit of the Defense Minister to Huliang in Arunachal Pradesh in November and has nothing to do with the family of the Defense Minister Is not
 ab isse saaf to ho gaya tha kii raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ke saath khadin mahila afasar unki beti nahin, balki bhartiya sena kii ek afasar hai
 We got information from the Ministry of Defense that the name of this female officer is Nikita Veraiah
 nikita keefesbook profilake anusaar wo karnataka ke mangalore shahar se hai or bhartiya fuj main karyrat hai
 Nikita has studied at Kendriya Vidyalaya Mangalore

 Later on the news and viral on social media, the Defense Ministry spokesperson gave clarification while posting this viral picture on Twitter, and he wrote that this picture was taken on the request of the woman officer during a recent official visit
 jaisaa ki kuch logon ne soshal media plateforms par daawa kiya, ye mahila afasar raksha mantri kii beti he
 "CLARIFICATION"
 This is the photograph clicked at the request of the Army officer appointed as the LO to the RM during an official visit

 hamane padtaal main yah bhi paaya ki raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman kii ek hi beti he or unaaka naam wangmayi paracal he
 In this way, the claim of the viral picture of India's first woman defense minister's daughter working in the Indian Army is absolutely false
 raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ke saath khadi mahila afasar unki beti nahin, balki sena kii ek afasar nikita veraiyya he

 Tamil Nadu Chief Minister j Jayalalithaa said that his support for Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's fast is as 'goodwill' and dismissed suggestions that his stand meant any change in the political equation

 This is on the lines of our policy of secularism and communal harmony and maintaining peace
 ’annadramuk pramukh ne kaha ki modi ne unhen phone kiya tha or unhone upwas ke dauraan kisi ko shubhakamana dene ke liye bhejne kaa anurodh kiya tha
 In fact, Jayalalithaa has sent her party's parliamentary leaders m Tambidurai and v Maitreyan as her representatives to be present during Modi's fast
 yah puche jane par ki kya unka samarthan raajnneetik sameekaran main badlaav kaa sanket detaa he, jayalalita ne kaha, ‘bilkul nahin, aap iskaa bahut kuch matlab nikaal rahe hai
 He said that this is only in the form of goodwill and there is nothing wrong in it as it is for the express purpose of maintaining communal peace and harmony

 Significantly, Modi and Jayalalithaa have good relations and attended the swearing-in ceremony of the AIADMK leader in May this year
