 Today, there are very few such films, which are successful in keeping you tied to yourself
 jab kangana ranut or rajkumaar raav starer film jajmental he kya ke aane kii baat hui thi tab sabhi ne sochaa tha ki aakhir is film main aisa kya khaas hota ki darshak ise dekhne ke liye jaaenge? kangana ranut kii film he to iske saath vivaad judana to banataa tha
 After a lot of publicity and controversy, this film is going to be released and we got a chance to see it
 ab film dekhne ke baad ye kahana jaruri ho gaya he ki yaar is film ko jaj mat karo kyonki aapako kaaphi majaa aane vaala he
 The first thing was the story of the film
 ye psychological thriller film he bobi or keshav ke bare main jo ek baar milte hai or phir shuru hota he mistry game
 Death has taken place in Keshava's house and who is responsible for this death from childhood, Bobby shaken from his mind or simple Keshav? This and much more will be seen in this film
 is film kii kahani badhiya he, jo bahut saare twist or terns se bhari hui he
 a dark story that keeps you connected with yourself as you move forward
 bobi (kangana ranut) apane bachapan ke troma se guzarane ke baad acute psychosis naam kii dimagi beemaari se jujh rahi he
 Her boyfriend cum manager Varun (hussain Dalal) is with her and is spending time with her buying vegetables instead of 'getting' something
 bobi ke ghar aate hai nae kirayedar keshav or rima, jinaki jindagi bobi ke liye kaaphi alag he
 Bobby, Keshav and Reema are attracted to this separate life, but due to a murder, their confusion breaks and she starts looking at Keshav with suspicion
 ab bobi ke dimag main jo chal rahaa he wo sahi he yaa nahin? ye jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni hogi
 Talking about performance, Kangana Ranaut and Rajkumar Rao have done wonders
 ek ladki, jo bachapan se hi pareshaan he or apana dimagi santulan kho chuki he lekin phir bhi apni jindagi ko apane alag andaaj main jiti he or apni asaliyat ko chupaane kii koshish nahin karti, ke role main kangana ne alag oonchai ko chuaa he
 Kangana's performance is unmatched and her character connects you with her in a way that does not leave you till the end
 vahiin rajkumaar raav ne kangana ko parformens ke maamle main jabardast takkar di he
 There is no doubt that Rajkumar is one of the most talented actors of Bollywood and he has played such a character with so many different layers that you cannot stop praising him
 rajkumaar apane role main bakhubi feet hue hai or uske saath puraa-puraa nyaay bhi kiya he
 Actors Hussain Dalal, Satish Kaushik, Amaira Dastur, Amrita Puri and Jimmy Shergill have done a great job in the supporting cast
 hossain dalal ke kirdaar ko dekhakar aapkaa dil pakkaa khush ho jayega, jo bahut mjedaar he
 Director Prakash Kovelamudi has done very well with this film
 film kii kahani badhiya he, uskaa excicution shandaar he, saare jokes or panchaline ekadam sahi timming ke saath hai or film ne puraa samay darshakon ko saath main jode rakhaa
 The film's drawback, however, was that the scenes were heavily drawn
 kuch nahin to second half main ek baar aapako jarur lagegaa ki bahut der ho gai he or film kaa clymex kyon nahin aa rahaa he! kuch chijen thodi si over thim, haalanki ho saktaa he ki apane massej ko aage badhaane ke liye unhen aisa banaaya gaya ho
 But this film is better than expected
 ek dark film, jisamen aap dimagi rup se pareshaan insaan kii najaron se ye duniya dekhenge, jo apane andar kii shanti baahar kii duniya main dhund rahi he
 Director Prakash has made this film very well
 film kii cinemetography or editing donon badhiya he
 The way Kangana and Rajkumar's character is explored is amazing
 film kaa mujeec kaaphi acha he
 Apart from Vakhara Swag, all the other songs of the film fit with every sequence
 iske alaava film kaa becoground score bahut badhiya he
 Director Prakash who has done wonders by playing with lights and music is worthy of praise
 iske alaava film ke dialog bhi badhiya hai
 The dialogues of this film not only make you laugh, but you remember it even after the end of the film
 film ke apane imotional seens hai, jo aapke dil main kuch harakat jarur paidaa karte hai
 Such films are rarely made in Bollywood, so overall you should definitely watch this film on weekends
 sach maniye kangana or rajkumaar kaa paagalpan aapako jarur pasand aayega

 bhartiya railway rajdhani or duranto jaisi premium trainon main ek bada badlaav karne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Under this, the government may replace the ac-two tier class to ac-three tier class in some premium trains
 sarkaar is badlaav ke jariye na sirf asi-thri tear class main bad rahi bheed ko kam karnaa chaahati he, balki logon ko kiraaye ke morche par bhi raahat isse milegi
 Actually railway premium trains are getting tough competition from airlines
 jahaan rajdhani samet anya premium trainon main asi-tu tear class ke tikat kaa kiraaya kareeb 5000 rupee tak pahunch jaataa he
 At the same time, many airlines are giving tickets for up to 4 thousand rupees on some routes
 doosraa kaaran, jis vajah se sarkaar kuch premium trainon main yah badlaav kar sakati he, vah yah he ki zyaadaatar samay pararsi-thri tear clasamen booking zyada ho jaati he
 This increases congestion, but this does not happen in ac-to-tier class
 indian express kii ek report ke mutabik in donon chunautiyon ko dekhte hue bhartiya railway kuch premium trainon main asi-2 ko asi-3 se badal sakati he
 With this, not only does the railway want to be successful in competing with the airline, but it will also cost the common man less money
 bataa den ki maujuuda samay main rajdhani samet kai premium trainon main flixi fere system lagu he
 This has increased the earnings of Indian Railways, but due to this, the fares of AC-2 are often more than the fares of the airline

 That is, if the original fare of a place is Rs 100, then the first 10 per cent tickets will be booked at the base price of Rs 100
 10 fisadi siton kii booking ke baad rajdhani or duranton ke agle 10 fisadi tikat 110 rupee ke aadhaar par book honge
 After this, after booking the next 20 percent tickets, the next 10 percent tickets will be booked at Rs 120
 30 fisadi tikat book hone ke baad agle 10 fisadi tikat 130 rupee par book honge
 Similarly, after 40 per cent ticket book, the next 10 per cent ticket will be booked at Rs 140

 The defeat of Congress in the assembly elections after two months in the urban body elections has made the workers sad

 Big leaders are hiding their faces due to the charisma of party veterans in the assembly elections

 The Congress, which performed better than expected in Uttar Pradesh in the last Lok Sabha election (2009), attributed this to the charisma of party leader Rahul Gandhi, but his charisma flopped in the assembly elections and sp's Akhilesh Yadav prevailed over him
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi ke bagaiyr aam chunaav main congress ke liye pichhlaa pradarshan doharaa paanaa behad kathin he
 In such a situation, forgetting the recent defeat, the party will have to activate Rahul once again in the state

 rajasthan ke saanwaraad main 12 july ke din gangster anandapal kii shradhanjali sabha main police firing ke dauraan ek shaks kii maut hui thi
 The police played a dirty game to hide the identity of the man
 jiskaa sach ab saamne aa gaya he
 The one who died was not a person from Rohtak but Surendra Singh Rathore of Malasar in Nagaur district
 police ne is baat ko chhipaane ke liye jhooth kaa sahaara liya tha
 On that day, a crowd of millions was gathered in Sanvarad
 shradhanjali sabha main bheed juty thi, jo achaanak police par tut padi
 The police was neferingki
 jisamen ek shaks kii maut ho gai thi
 Surendra Singh Rathore was the person who died in the police firing that day
 lekin police rajputon ke aakrosh se bachane ke liye paanch din tak us vyakti ko haryana ke rohtak kaa brahman lalchand sharma bataati rahi
 The police had brought his dead body to Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur
 paanchaven din shaam ko khulaasa hua ki police firing main maranevaale kaa naam lalchand sharma nahin wo to nagaur jile ke malasar kaa surendra singh rathod he
 Surendra Singh Rathore, son of retired army officer Kalyan Singh
 gangster anandapal ke gaanv ke paas ke hi malasar gaanv he, surendra vahiin kaa rahane vaala tha
 Surendra used to work in a private company
 vah chuttee lekar shradhanjali sabha main shaamil hone aayaa tha
 Actually, the pictures of Surendra Rathore had gone viral in the social media group of Rajputs
 ye photo surendra kii bahan ne jaipur main dekha to apane pita kalyaan singh ko phone karke tasviir ke bare main bataaya
 Kalyan Singh then arrived at the police station and came to Jaipur and identified his son
 12 july kii police firing ke baad se hin surendra singh gaayab tha
 The family members were looking for him and the police knew it too
 lekin, iske baavjood police use haryana kaa brahman bataati rahi or ye kahati rahi ki koi laash lene ke liye nahin aa rahaa he
 While the village of Surendra Singh Rathore is next to Malasar Sanvarada
 uske pita kalyaan singh ne bataaya ki uskaa phone 12 july se hin band tha or ham or hamaare sabhi rishtedaar uski khojbin kar rahe the, magarpulisakah rahi thi, marane vaala haryana kaa lalchand sharma he
 On the other hand, when the police found themselves surrounded, a new story was told
 police ke mutabik surendra singh ne marane se pehle deedwanaa ke aspataal main apana naam lalchand sharma bataaya tha or khud ko haryana kaa rahane vaala bataaya tha
 However, this argument of the police is not embracing anyone
 kyonki police ko shaayad pataa chal gaya tha marane vaala paas ke gaanv kaa rajput he
 Then the dead body was brought to the fronts of Jaipur
 ab is maamle ke khul jane ke baad police kii kirakiri ho rahi he
 After the reality came to light, Rajput organizations have demanded further compensation along with the investigation into Surender Singh's death

 After rejecting the offer to join the central government, Nitish Kumar is now going to expand the Bihar government
 nitish ravivaar ko apane mantrimandal kaa karenge vistaar
 Some new people will be included in the cabinet
 bihar se do mantri dinesh chandra yadav or lalan singh saansad chune jane ke baad istifa de chuke hai
 Let us tell you that just before the swearing-in ceremony of PM Modi, the National President of Janata Dal United Nitish Kumar clearly said that he is with the BJP but on his proposal to accept the formal invitation to join the cabinet symbolically People did not give their consent
 nitish is baat ko lekar khapha dikhe ki akali dal, jiske do sansad hai, use or paswan jinke chah sansad hai, kii party kaa bhi ek-ek cabinet mantri banaaya gaya jabaki unki party jediu ke 16 sansad hai or uske liye bhi itani hi jagah mantrimandal main rakhi gai
 There are several reasons behind Nitish Kumar's non-acceptance of a cabinet post
 unamem sabase pehla kaaran unki apni party main sansadon kii naaraazgi pramukh he
 But even more, Nitish Kumar is upset with the formula in which the BJP has started following a policy of imposing decisions on allies
 bhavishya main khaas taur par bihar vidhansabha chunaav main agar yahi formula doharaaya gaya to unako lene ke dene pad sakate hai
 Therefore, making public the decision not to join the cabinet, Nitish Kumar gave a clear indication to the BJP that there was no compulsion on him to accept the bjp's decision

 Shiv Sena said, 'democracy has won in Karnataka
 bijepi ne rajya main zyada siten jeetin thi lekin vah satta se baahar rahi, jo janadesh ke khilaaf tha
 The Kumaraswamy government was built on a weak system, which fell due to the rebellion of some mlas
 madhya pradesh or rajasthan main bhi loktantr jivit rahegaa yaa nahin yah to samay hi batayega
 The editorial of the Sena mouthpiece Saamana states that the political drama in Karnataka has finally come to an end
 congress ke kandhon par savaar gathbandhan 14 maheene baad aakhirkaar khatm ho gaya he
 The opposition lost another state and opened the way for the bjp's chief minister

 Kumar Vishwas, however, denied the allegation of such remarks against Bedi
 unka kahana he ki agar bedi ye sabit kar den to vah raajnneeti chhod denge
 Kiran Bedi alleges that Kumar Vishwas made a very vulgar remark against her at an election rally
 bedi ne twit kiya, 'aap ke us netritv se mahilaayein kis tarah kii suraksha or maryaada kii ummid kar sakati hai, jisaki ghor sexist or vikrut maansikta he?' unhone kaha, 'puri tarah se apmanjanak sexist tippanee, galat sandesh dete hue gaiyrkanoonee tasviren, yah sab aniatik, vishaiylla, vikrut he
 ' vahiin vishwaas ne is aarope ko khaarij karte hue kaha, 'main hairaan hum ki channel video nahin dikhaa rahe hai
 There were cameras from many channels
 vahaan chunaav ayog kaa bhi ek camera tha
 He said, "this is the online channel of the BJP, which has started spreading rumors like this, because it came to know that the BJP was trailing
" is tarah ke bayaan dena unka roj kaa kaam he
 i challenge Kiran Bedi and the BJP to see if they can prove these comments and show the video related to it
 agar ve aisa kar dete hai to main raajnneeti chhod duungaa, nahin to bedi ko raajnneeti chhodani chahie
 ' vishwaas ne kaha ki unki tippanee kaa makasad bedi par nahin, balki bijepi par nishaanaa sadhana tha
 He said that the BJP has become nervous before the election and that is why Union ministers have been deployed in the election campaign

 He had said, "it is a disputed region between Bhutan and China
 yahaan se chini sena sainya balon kii tainaati main kuch kami lani chahie
 But it may be that China will reduce its force after the winter passes

 "china and Pakistan may be extremely shocked by the growing friendship with the US, and now India's close proximity to Israel
 aise main china bharat ko antarrashtriya str par swachand sthiti banaae nahin rakhane dena chahta hoga
 It may be that China's action is to keep India from being implicated in the Doklam dispute

 jadeja ko ballebaaji main ravichandran aswin se neeche bheja gaya or is par bhartiya captain ne kaha, agar aswin or mere bich acchhee saajhedaari ho jaati to jadeja antim overon main teji se ran bator saktaa tha, jabaki aswin ke liye slog karnaa aasaan nahin hota, isi ko dhyaan main rakhte hue hamane yah faisla kiya tha
 Avoiding answering on the issue of more bilateral series between India and Pakistan, Dhoni said, "it is special wherever the match against Pakistan is
 pichley dedh saal main donon tiimon ke bich hue muqablon main kaaphi naram rukh dekhne ko mila he
 Sometimes an incident happens on the field
 pakistan ke khilaaf match haalanki bisisiai par nirbhar karte hai
 We are soldiers, we will go where the BCCI sends us
 bhartiya captain ne haalanki ek baar phir team main sakasham olerounder kii jarurat par jor diya
 Dhoni said, due to the change in rules, we need a good all-rounder who can do both bowling and batting
 irfan pathan ke alaava hamaare paas koi vaastavik olerounder nahin he
 Bhuvneshwar bowled well, but he would also have to contribute in batting to become an all-rounder
 use apane khel ke is paksh main sudhaar karnaa hoga
 He said, he is a bowler like Praveen Kumar
 jab praveen aayaa tha to 135 kimi prati ghanta kii raftaar se gendbiji karata tha or shaayad bhubaneshwar kii raftaar bhi itani he, lekin vah kaaphi samajhadaar gendbaaj he
 Overall, there is room for improvement
 dhoni ne kaha, main ballebaajon ke bachaav main sirf itnaa bol saktaa hum ki aaj hamane itane ran banaae, jitne jaruri the
 We should have scored higher than this
 shuruyaat main wicket ganvaane ke baad hamane bich ke overon main bhi kaaphi wicket ganvaae
 We 220
 
 Could score 225 runs
 unhone kaha, hamaari team salaami ballebaajon par kaaphi nirbhar karti he, isliye acchhee shuruyaat kaaphi jaruri he
 However, the season in which matches are being played helps the fast bowlers and Pakistan's bowling attack is quite good
 bhartiya captain se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya 167 ran kaa score kaaphi tha to unhone kaha, hamen pataa tha ki 168 ke aasapaas ran kaaphi nahin hone vaale
 We decided that we would not look at the scoreboard, which helped
 gendbaajon ne kaaphi anushaasit gendbaaji kii
 At such a time, fast bowlers try to experiment a lot and throw short balls, but in this match they bowled at one place
 sahvaag ko is match main nahin khilaane par dhoni ne kaha ki yah badlaav antim lamhon par kiya gaya
 He said, in the last XI, this change was made in the last moments
 kabhi-kabhi kuch chijen aapke haath main nahin hoti
 Dhoni termed the win in this match as important before the five-match ODI series against England
 tippaniyan He said, such a victory is very important
 isse lay banane main madad milti he
 When people reject you, then such a victory is inspired
 team ke achche pradarshan main puri team ke prayaas ko ahm bataate hue dhoni ne kaha, main kisi se yah ummid nahin kar rahaa he ki vah 100 yaa 150 ran yaa bada shatak banaakar team ko jeet dilaae
 i want to contribute
 khilaadi 45 ke aasapaas ran kaa yogadan den or 80 se 90 ran kii saajhedaari karen to bhi acha rahegaa
 Defending the decision to give Ravindra Jadeja a chance in bowling in place of Yuvraj Singh, Dhoni said, "the new rule of keeping five fielders within 30 yards is causing us some harmony
" yuvi ko in niyamon kaa aadi hone main samay lagegaa or ham use samay dena chaahate hai, kyonki aapako midwicket yaa deep midwicket upar rakhkar gendbaaji kerani hoti he or yah aasaan nahin hota
 Jadeja was sent down from Ravichandran Ashwin in the batting and to this the Indian captain said, "if there was a good partnership between Ashwin and me, Jadeja could have scored fast in the final overs, while it would not have been easy for Ashwin to slog
" Keeping this in mind, we made this decision
 bharat or pakistan ke bich or adhik dwipaksheeya shrunkhalaaon ke mudde par jawaab dene se bachate hue dhoni ne kaha, pakistan ke khilaaf match kahin bhi ho yah vishesh hota he
 In the last one and a half years, the matches between the two teams have seen a very soft attitude
 maidan par kabhi-kabhaar hi koi ghatana hoti he
 Matches against Pakistan, however, depend on the BCCI
 ham to sainik hai, bisisiai hamen jahaan bhejega ham vahaan chale jaaenge
 The Indian captain, however, once again emphasized the need for a competent all-rounder in the team
 dhoni ne kaha, niyamon main badlaav ke kaaran hamen ek achche olerounder kii jarurat he, jo gendbaaji or ballebaaji donon kar sake
 Apart from Irfan Pathan, we have no real all-rounder
 bhubaneshwar ne acchhee gendbaaji kii, lekin use olerounder banane ke liye ballebaaji main bhi yogadan dena hoga
 He will have to improve on this side of his game
 unhone kaha, vah praveen kumaar kii tarah kaa gendbaaj he
 When Praveen came, he used to bowl at a speed of 135 km per hour and perhaps Bhubaneswar has the same speed, but he is a very sensible bowler
 kul milakar usamen abhi sudhaar kii gunjaaish he
 He said, such a victory is very important
 isse lay banane main madad milti he

 ek tivi channel ke saath saakshaatkaar main ahaluwalia ne kaha ise :paardarshita: hameshaa hi badhaane kii jarurat hoti he, or jahaan tak meraa maananaa he ki pichley samay main yah zyada nahin rahi he
 i believe that whether you call it transparency or efficiency, the system needs a lot of improvement
 unhone kaha, montek sihan ahaluwalia desh main adhik prabhavi paryaavaran sangrakshan yojana ke paksh main he, lekin iske bare main sthiti pehle se hi kaaphi kuch spasht or paardarshee honi chahie
 He said that the system was not very transparent in the past in terms of environmental clearance and its implementation has not been effective
 unhone kaha, meraa maananaa he ki bhavishya main hamen is kshetra main puri tarah paardarshita apnaani chaahi
 Ahluwalia said that there should be an established system in which industries should be monitored in a certain period for compliance with environmental regulations
 pariyojnaon ke maamle main paryaavaran mantralay ke adnge ke chalate isse pehle yojana ayog upaadhyaksh ne paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh kii aalochana karte huye kaha tha ki khanan pariyojnaon ke nishedh maamle main soch samajhakar paribhaasha banaai jaani chahie
 Whatever its criteria should be, there should be a scientific basis behind it

 The spinner told England, 'I don't know that the news of his return to the Indian team worked as a tonic but i was in excellent form playing for Essex last week
 main aisa mahasoos kar rahaa hum jaise ki mere sir se bada boj hat gaya
 The weather was good last week and it helped me regain my rhythm
 ’is 32 varshiya spinner ne pichley do county match main 11 wicket liye
 He took five wickets for 37 runs in a Pro-40 match against Holland's national team on Sunday and scored 22 runs off 13 balls
 harbhajan ne kaha, ‘main peshewar khilaadi hum or asex kii taraf se yogadan dena meraa kaam he
 It is a very good team and i will be thankful to the management because playing in the county helped me come back
 ’unhone kaha, ‘maine kabhi nahin sochaa ki mujhe avkaash kii jarurat he
 i worked hard to return to the Indian team
 mere liye sabase raahat kii baat khelte rahanaa tha
 i know when i need rest, but definitely i don't need rest now
 ’harbhajan ko county cricket main khilne kaa sabase bada phayda yah mila unhone lambey spel kiye
 He bowled for 65 overs in the match against Glomorgan
 unhone kaha, ‘main lambey spel karnaa chahta tha or mujhe khushi he ki main kuch lambey spel karne main safal rahaa
 i am happy with the first innings spell because i succeeded my team after the batsmen of the opposing team set foot at the crease
 duusari pari main samay simit tha or maine chotii ke teen ballebaajon ko out kiya
 Harbhajan said, "the bowler knows when his rhythm is good
" main mahasoos kar saktaa hum ki main acchhee gendbaaji kar rahaa hum
 i can feel the seam that is necessary
 gend par meri grip acchhee he
 In long spells, i notice variations which are not possible in T20 as there is very less chance of mistake

 He said, 'I am happy to play more and more first class matches because i am getting a chance to bowl more

 ’ Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav have already made it clear that the merger of Janata Parivar will be led by Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav

 Mulayam Singh Yadav will be seen in the role of the new party president
 yah khabar angreji akhbaar da times of india ne di he
 What will not be the merger of Janata Parivar? However, what will be the party's flag, it has not been decided yet
 khabar he ki vilay ko lekar aane vaale ravivaar ko nitish kumaar dilli aane vaale hai
 Earlier, Nitish Kumar, Mulayam Singh and Lalu Prasad had a meeting last week regarding the grand alliance
 isamen jediu ke adhyaksh sharad yadav or kasee tyaagi ne bhi hissaa liya tha
 Some issues of deadlock could be resolved in this meeting itself
 'janata parivaar' main mulaayam ko nahin phayda!sapa kaa gemplandrasal, samaajawaadee party ke netaaon ko is vilay se chunavi taur par zyada phayda hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 They feel that the strength of JDU and RJD is limited to Bihar
 isliye party vilay ko lekar bahut zyada utsahit nahin rahi he, par party chinh or naam ko lekar argedy va jediu ke samjhautavaadi ravaiye ne vilay ke liye raah aasaan kar di he
 Perhaps this is the reason why Mulayam Singh has also managed to convince the SP leaders on the merger by arguing that the identity of the party remains intact
 argedy-jediu gathbandhan kii najar bihar chunaav parvilay kaa sabase bada siyaasi phayda rashtriya janata dal or janata dal united ko hoga
 Till now, both the parties have been at loggerheads in the elections, many times even damaging each other's vote bank
 agar vilay ho jaataa he to donon partiyon ke votbank kaa saath aana tay mana ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, this alliance will be in a position to challenge the BJP in the state
 or bijepi vidhansabha chunaav main haar jaati he to iskaa asar uttar pradesh chunaavon main bhi dikhegaa

 For this, CM Yogi has issued a decree to all the officials of the state that they should start functioning in their offices at 9 am
 soobe ke duusare jilon main adhikariyon ko janata se milane ke liye or vakt par offis pahunchane ke nirdesh die gaye the
 However, this order of Chief Minister Yogi was not having any effect on the officers sitting in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh
 wo aadesh ke baad bhi lagaataar deree se offis pahunch rahe the
 In such a situation, CM Yogi has again started the exercise of starting the biometric system, so that the officers will get rid of the late habits and they can reach office on time and give more time to government work

 Eight thousand saints wearing saffron
 or aawaaj sirf ram mandir kii
 This view of Mahakumbh at the confluence site in Allahabad is not only for saints, it is also like that
 isamen santon ke saath-saath siyasat or sangh parivaar kaa aisa ghol he, jo 24 baras baad najar aa rahaa he
 In 1989 something similar was done by the Central Board of Directors at that time
 pi
 The entire world was seen by the Singh government after four months and after that the game of car service which ended with the demolition of Babri Masjid
 is baar babari masjid nahin he lekin sant, sangh parivaar or siyasat kaa sangam kuch usee tarah he
 Sant Ram is raising the question of culture regarding the temple
 sangh parivaar ram mandir main desh kii asmita ko talash rahaa he
 And the BJP is looking for that saffron ground for politics, where the path of coming to power for 2014 is coming out
 yani raste kii talash teenon ko he
 But whether this path is only for Mission 2014 or Mission 2014, it should be considered as one stop of your path, the contradiction is also its
 dharm sansad main pehali baar sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ne sanket main hi narendra modi ko bhi nayak bataaya or unhen hindutv kii jameen par khadaa kar mandir banavaane waalon ke haath satta saunpane ke khwab bhi dikhaa die
 He said, "the one who builds the temple will only get power
" satta main vahi rahegaa, jo mandir banayega
 "that is, the question is no longer whether the Sangh has to face the chaos within the BJP
 sawaal yah he ki bijepi ab sangh ko apni siyasat tale ulajhati he yaa apni siyasat ko sangh kii hatheli par rakh detii he
 While the BJP president was taking a dip in the Sangam and reciting the uninterrupted text of the Ram temple among the saints, Narendra Modi, the most popular BJP leader, was teaching development lessons to the youth in Delhi
 jab vishwa hindu parishad (viechpi) ke sangrakshak adhyaksh ashok singhl modi kii tulana nehru se kar rahe the, uske kaaryakari adhyaksh praveen togdipha modi ko lekar santon ke bich ek aisi lakshmana rekha khinch rahe the, jahaan koi yah naam tak na le
 On the other hand, Modi was calling for the development of six crore Gujaratis in Delhi, when Togadia was calling for the linking of 15 crore youth with the Ram Mandir movement in the guide board
 aise doraahe bijepi kii jarurat hai yaa sangh kii ranneeti kaa hissaa, samajhnaa ise bhi jaruri he
 If Rajnath chants the Ram temple and Modi raises the question of development and warns the youth not to get caught in the politics of vote bank, then the issue of Hindutva or Ram temple is not so simple this time
 rajnath santon or sangh se aashirwad lene sangam pahunche
 But in the current situation, Modi is the only Swayamsevak who is a Sangh pracharak
 or sangh parivaar main pehali baar is sach ko lekar khushi he ki unka ek prachaarak desh ke tamaam rajanetaaon par na sirf siyaasi taur par baari he, balki jan-lokapriyata ke maapdand par bhi khara utraa he
 Like Modi, neither Atal Bihari Vajpayee nor LK Advani was in the list of pracharaks
 philhal sangh ke prachaarkon kii fehrist ko rajnatik taur par dekhen to sirf teen naam hi jehan main aaengeh ke
 N
 govindacharya, madandas devi or suresh soni
 How these three names are popular only within the Sangh Parivar or whether they have been laying political chasers amid the untold story of sangh-bjp relationship is not hidden from anyone
 vajah yahi he ki sangh hi nahin, sant bhi yah maanate hai ki rajanetaaon kii fehrist main koi unke dil ke sabase kareeb he to ve modi hi hai
 This is the reason why saints in a religious parliament took the name of a leader for the first time that he should be installed as the Prime Minister
 santon ne yah aawaaj kabhi vaajapeyi yaa adwani ko lekar nahin uthaai
 But another aspect of it is that no one else but VHP in Gujarat has been troubled by Modi's methods, which may have to lead the temple movement now
 to pehla bada sawaal yahi he ki modi hindutv yaa ram mandir kaa raag chhod vikaas ke jis raste par apni nai chhavi banane nikal pade hai, vah maujuuda rajnatik satta sameekaran ke liye he yaa phir pehali baar sangh parivaar is sach ko samaj rahaa he ki hindutv ke soch ko sirf mandir tak atakane kaa matlab he satta tak pahunchane ke baaki kai raaston ko band karnaa
 The second question starts from here that the definition of the government which is trying to create Hindutva with terror, its stain should be changed as royalty, this is not the second strategy of BJP and Sangh Parivar
 chaahe 340 pratinidhiyon kii kendriya maardarshak mandal kii baithak ho yaa saat hajaar se zyada santon kaa dharm sammelan, usamen hindu aatankwaad ke mudde ko uthaaya hi is tarah gaya, jisase har sant or swayamsevak ko yah lage ki uske khamosh rahane yaa bhavishya main khadey hone vaale andolan se na judye par sankat uske apane astitv par aayega
 That is why the BJP has given open consent to the VHP laying the outline of Ram temple movement
 or andolan ko vot bank siyasat se jodgaye kaa hathiyaar banane kii disha main bhi thos pahal ho rahi he
 It is a unique political thinking in itself that the vhp-led saints across the country will connect the youth of the age group of 18 to 30 years in their respective areas with the movement to build Ram temple by making a pledge that they will be their own in the 2014 elections
 Do cast votes or inaki taadaad 15 karod hogi
 This is a very unlikely vow, but the VHP religion is talking through Parliament, the indications are clear that the BJP cannot escape the Ram temple issue even if it wants, and the allied political parties standing with it, despite wanting their body from soft Hindutva Can not get rid yah mushkil congress ke saamne bhi hogi
 Therefore, if we examine the politics of vote-backs in a series of agitations about the Ram temple in a systematic way, then in 2009, BJP got just over eight and a half million votes
 jabaki satta main baithi congress ko saadhe gyaarah karod vot mili the
 In such a situation, if the movement starts without the bjp's participation in the country after the call of the Dharma Parliament, then the mind of crores of youth who were not born during the Ayodhya movement
 darasal, bijepi hi nahin, samooche sangh parivaar ke saamne bhi yahi sawaal sabase bada he ki na sirf vot bank ke lihaaj se balki andolan ko urjavan banane ke liye bhi jo peedi maujuud he, usne ayodhya andolan ke bare main apane janm ke baad sirf suna he
 And what has been heard, he adds to the secularism of the country
 aise main vah yuva man kaise inhen singhl or togdipha ke saath khadaa ho jayega jo dhai dashak pehle bhi yahi raag alaap rahe the
 And despite getting power around this, the BJP shelved the issue of Ram temple itself
 haalanki bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne is samvaadadaata ko die intervyuu main teen tathy safagoi se rakhe
 First, until the BJP gets a majority on its own, how can it build the Ram temple
 doosraa ram mandir ko bhulaakar bijepi kaise apane astitv ko banaae rakh sakati he
 And the third Hindutva is the stream through which development can be talked about
 yani modi ke vikaas se lekar sangh parivaar ke ram mandir ko ek chhatari tale laane main hi rajnath apni upyogita dekh rahe hai
 But from here also three questions of Delhi and Dharma Parliament arise
 pehla viechpi kii mushkil yah he ki ’90 ke daur ko dobaaraa jeene jaisi takat uske paas nahin he
 Secondly, the bjp's contradiction that it cannot come to power on its own and with the coordination of its allies, they do not have the option of Congress economy in the current era
 or teesraa sangh parivaar ke mukhiya bhagwat jis ram mandir ko apana mishan maane hue hai, vah tab tak sambhav nahin he, jab tak aresas kii basic soch ke saath uske apane teen darjan sanghathan or bijepi ek saath sadaa vatsale na kehane lagen
 On behalf of the Sangh, Bhagwat started it after a long time by going to vhp's Kumbhiya in Shamiyan
 7 farvari ko dharm sansad or sant mahasammelan ke shuru hone se paanch ghante pehle viechpi camp main jaakar or ram mandir abhiyaan par apana thappa laga kar bhagwat ne pehle hi sanket de diya ki aane vaale vakt main mandir ko lekar aguai viechpi ko kerani he lekin is mudde ke sahare parivaar ko ekajute karnaa unka pehla makasad bhi he
 The effect was whether Mahamandaleshwar Swami Vaishnavadas from Rajkot or Mahamandaleshwar Swami Bhagavanta Nandagiri from Maharashtra or Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati from Badrinath — all spoke in one speech to stop and attain the politics of Hindutva
 sangh parivaar ke bheetar modi ko lekar teen dharanaen saaf hai
 Sardar Patel did the work in Gujarat silently about the Somnath temple
 vah kaam uttar pradesh main ayodhya ko lekar koi kar nahin paaya he or maujuuda halaat main gujarati modi hi ayodhya ko sangh parivaar ke makasad tak pahunchaa sakate hai
 The Sangh Parivar considers Modi to be successful in penetrating even the economic structure of the Congress, which has been built by Manmohan Singh
 or teesraa parivaar ko aatank se jodgaye ke congressi daawey kii hawa nikaalane main modi ko safal maanata he
 That is, socially combine the Ram mandir-hindutva Sangh Parivar and politically unite the BJP through Modi
 dharm sansad se itar sangam main pahunche karodon logon kii anugunj ne kuch aise sawaalon ko bhi janm diya, jiskaa jawaab na sangh parivaar ke paas he or na bijepi ke paas
 Nor will the VHP be able to respond to them through its future movement
 masalan 1984 main dilli main hui pehali dharm sansad se lekar ab tak kii har dharm sansad main vahi dharm sansad safal rahi jo siyasat ko dhamkaate hue chunavi sameekaran banane yaa bigaadpee kii sthiti main ho

 kuch dinon pehle tanushri datta ne ajay devgan par alokanath sang film de de pyaar de main kaam karne ko lekar tanj ksaa tha
 Apart from Tanushree, Kangana's sister Rangoli also accused Ajay Devgan of appearing in the tweets
 is baat se naaraaz ajay devgan ne haal hi main ek aadhikarik bayaan diya he
 He has said that the shooting of the film was completed even before Aloknath was accused
 us vakt halaat mere bas main nahin the
 Ajay finally broke his silence on the questions of working with Aloknath in the film De De Pyar De
 unhone kaha ki 'yah film pichley saal oktober main relies honi chahie thi kyonki isaki shooting sitambar main puri ho chuki thi
 All the scenes shot with Aloknath were completed in August
 yah sabhi seen 40 din ke andar alag alag set par shoot kiye gaye the jisamen ek outdoor lokation bhi tha
 It consisted of 10 actors
 alokanath ke saath shooting puri hone ke baad unpar aarope saamne aae
 '(contd)
 
 
 
 and all those who are enjoying the sweetness of silence just because it is happening to someone else's daughter shall know the world is round and everything comes around 🙏 # Metoo— Rangoli Chandel (@rangoli_a) April 17, 2019 All actors removing Aloknath in those scenes It was almost impossible to re-shoot with a repeat date and combination
 isse producers ke kaaphi paison kaa nuksaan bhi hota
 The decision to replace Aloknath could not be mine
 puri unit ke faisle ke saath mujhe janaa hi padataa
 i am very sensitive to the Meitu campaign
 lekin aise halaat main jab usapar meraa kaabo nahin he to pataa nahin kyon log mujhe ek asanvadensheel or jhootha insaan batalaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Ajay kept avoiding answering any questions related to Aloknath during the trailer launch of De De Pyar De
 in sawaalon par ajay ne kaha tha ki alokanath par aarope lagane se pehle hi film kii shooting puri ho chuki thi
 It is worth noting that earlier Ajay Devgan supported the metoo campaign on social media
 ajay ne kaha tha ki ve aise kisi vyakti ke saath kaam nahin karenge jinpar is tarah ke galat kaam karne kaa aarope ho
 It is because of these men our country is a black spot on world map as far as crimes against women are concerned, shame on you bollywood for mocking # metoohttps: / / t

 He and his company believe in providing dignity and protection to women
 agar kisi ne kisi bhi mahila ke saath kuch galat kiya he to naa adief or naa hi ve us aaropee ke saath hai
 However, later during an interview with PTI, Ajay said that there are many people whose names have come as a shock to him, but i cannot be judgmental with anyone till the charges are proved
 These men are so intoxicated with power and money, they are teasing the movement by supporting fellow harassers and slyly mocking the victims, also shamelessly defending their actions with lame excuses
 
 
 (contd) - Rangoli Chandel (@rangoli_a) April 17, 2019 Recently, actress Tanushree Dutta lambasted Ajay Devgan and the film's producers for working with Meethu's alleged Aloknath
 unhone post ke jariye ajay devgan kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha tha ki puraa shahar jhuthe, dikhavi logon or paakhandiyon se bharaa he
 Let us tell you that writer Vinata Nanda has accused Aloknath of rape
 tanushri ne kaha ki ek baar alokanath par lage aarope saarvajanik ho jate to alokanath ke sabhi seen ri-shoot kiye ja sakate the
 But by placing a rape accused in the film, not only did he win over Vinata Nanda but he has won over all of us

 Hello, i am Ravish Kumar
 
 
 kaash suut ke bahaane saarvajanik jivan main maujuud hamaare netaaon ke pahanaave or unki keemat par khulkar charchaa ho jaati
 Then you would know on the pretext of Prime Minister's suit how expensive suits and shawls of other leaders are
 acchhee fabric kaa jawahar jacket aath-das hajaar main aa jaataa he, linen kaa kurta bhi itane kaa ban jaataa he, magar suut length teen se paanch chah lakh kaa hota he
 The cost of a shawl can also be in lakhs
 kai vidhayak paanch-chah lakh kaa suut pahane dikh jate hai
 He must have earned so much of his hard work
 26 janvari ko dilli main raashtrapati obama ke saath pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jis suut ko pahana tha, use surat ke vigyaan centre main pratimaa par nilaamee ke liye tonga gaya he
 Apart from this suit, 237 items of clothing were also put up for auction, but not everyone's luck is like this suit
 kisi ko aupchaarik rup se yah pataa nahin ki is suut kii keemat kya hogi, magar rahul gandhi ne ise apni chunavi reliyon main das lakh kaa bataaya tha
 BJP MP CR Patil said that people of Surat will charge more than Rahul Gandhi
 pradhanmantri ko mila suut hamaare liye anmol he
 By the way, Rahul Gandhi was not bidding in the auction, making allegations in the election
 anya chizon kii boli bhale hi kuch hazaron main lagi, lekin suut kii nilaamee lakh se shuru hokar shaam hote-hote ek karod bees lakh tak pahunch gai
 The final price will be known on the third day, when the auction ends
 kharidaar modi ke phans hai, jo unke saath apane sambandhon ko bahut purana bataa rahe hai
 Let us tell you that Narendra Modi as the Chief Minister of Gujarat has been auctioning all the gifts received and giving the proceeds from it to the government schemes
 ve kam se kam ye to bataate hai ki mukhyamantri ke taur par kitne uphaar mili or unka unhone kya kiya
 The rest of the chief ministers are not publicly known
 lekin is kahani main ek or twist aayaa he
 That the suit was not made by the Prime Minister himself, but was given by a family friend as a gift
 heere ke kaarobaar se judi company ke nideshak ramesh viraani eenai news agency ke zariye saamne aae or puraa kissa bataaya
 For the remaining questions, we also tried to contact but failed
 
 Rameshkumar Bhikabhai Virani said that he had given this suit as a length gift while inviting the Prime Minister to his son's wedding, because his father would always give a dhoti whenever he met his brother
 suut par modi ji kaa naam likhane kaa idia mere bete kaa tha, jo unhen aisa tohfa dena chahta tha, jisase ve chaunk jaaen
 Virani sir did not tell the price, but said that what is being told is not so much and my son does not have the courage to spend such a huge amount
 jawaab dete-dete viraani sahab kautuhal ko uksaa gaye ki aakhir britain se aisa suut banavaane main kitna kharch aata hoga
 Now the further story is that the same day the Prime Minister had told Virani ji that he would auction these suits and give the money to the Ganga cleaning campaign
 viraani ji is baat ko lekar bhavuk hai ki pradhanmantri ne unke paariwarik rishte kaa maan rakhaa or usee din pahana jis din unke bete kii shaadi thi
 That is, on 26 January
 agar itani si baat thi to viraani ji chunaav ke dauraan hi suut ke vivaadon par viraam laga sakate the
 But did Virani Ji's cleanup stop
 jis din nilaamee kii khabar media main ai, uske agle din yani buudhvaar ko viraani ji saamne aae
 But why is the Congress aggressive about this suit since morning
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par unka har pahanava chatkhadaar hota tha
 During Manmohan Singh's despair, the public accepted these colors as part of his leadership
 kai logon ne unke style statement yani fashanparasti par bhi khub likhaa ki wo pahanane-odhane main bhi kitna khyaal rakhte hai
 Even after the election, their colorful kurtas and jackets became a copycat for many brand stores
 magar is suut ne aisa kya kar diya yaa isamen aisi kya khaas baat thi, jisase unhen apane pahanaave ko lekar vivaadon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Name to be written or its price
 kyonki daam ko lekar media kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal uth rahe hai ki yah rakam kahaan se aa gai
 Now the issue with the name remains
 dilli chunaav main suut mudda ban gaya
 It was also discussed in the international press
 10 farvari ke baad se saarvajanik manchon par pradhanmantri ke pahanaavon ko dekhen to unamem ek kism kii saadagi he
 If they are making any corrections about this, shouldn't they get a chance
 aaj hi bangaloru main unhone saamaanya rang kaa kurta or sadri pahana tha
 Earlier, there was a simplicity in his attire even with the President of Sri Lanka
 vaise is tarah kaa kurta or jacket wo pehle bhi pahante rahe hai
 i found her dress with the Russian President in Hyderabad far better than her colorful kurtas
 kahin-kahin prince suut main bhi nazar aae, magar aisa lagata he ki philhal ke liye unhone apane pahanaave main badlaav kiya he
 The BJP has been witnessing this controversy from the beginning on a personal level and with little politics
 dilli chunaav ke dauraan vitt mantri arun jetali kaa tab ek aisa hi bayaan aayaa tha
 Congress seems very active about the news of the auction
 party kaa kahana he ki damege control yani apni chhavi ko bigadane se bachaane ke liye is suut kii nilaamee ho rahi he

 Many times, what happens to the debris left in the house or shop after any construction or repair becomes a question

 However, many complainants say that this facility is not effective
 kai kai baar phone lagane par yaa to phone uthaaya nahin jaataa yaa koi jawaab nahin diya jaataa or agar shikaayat darj kar lee jaae to bhi biemasi vah malba uthaane nahin aati
 However, many complainants say that this facility is not effective
 kai kai baar phone lagane par yaa to phone uthaaya nahin jaataa yaa koi jawaab nahin diya jaataa or agar shikaayat darj kar lee jaae to bhi biemasi vah malba uthaane nahin aati
 Hakim and rulers wage war by showing Awam a dream of a golden future
 jang thamati he to koi jeetne kii khushrahmi main duba rahata he, to koi haarane ke gam main, jabaki sachai ye he ki jang main hameshaa zindagi hi harati he
 But here also the ruler is his own, the country also his own and his own
 phir bhi apane hi haakim ne apane hi desh kii janata par aasmaan se aisa jehar barsaaya ki pal bhar main 70 log maut ke munh main samaa gaye
 Most of them were children
 ji haa, ham syria main hueracinic hamaleki hi baat kar rahe hai
 Many breaths stopped after the attack say that giving smile to the killers is also no less than a prayer
 par jab saansen kaatil ban jaae to kilkaariyaan goonjati nahin balki ghut jaati hai
 And this is what happened to the rebel-held Dome city in eastern Ghouta, Syria
 sara shahar so kar bas uthaa hi tha ki shahar ke asaman se neeche bam gira
 Chemical gas came out of the bomb and then on seeing it, the breath of people dissolved in such a way that more than 100 people stopped breathing
 hazaron ke dam ghutane lage
 Air Force Attack The Syrian Airforce claims an NGO named The White Helmets of Syria
 isamen 100 se zyaada log maare gaye or kareeb ek hazaar log jakhmi ho gaye
 However, a second report puts the death toll at around 70
 jinamein bacchon kii taadaad zyaada he
 a chemical bomb strikes again in the dreaded face of Syria
 bairel bamase chodi gai rasinic gas
 And then the date of humanity saw such a frightening view of death from the sky that the spectators of the bus watchers trembled
 insaanon ke banaae sabase khatarnaak or jaanaleva hathiyaar ko insaanon par hi aazamaaya ja rahaa tha or aazamaaish aisi ki minuton main laashon ke dher lag gaye
 No one knows when the storm that rained from the sky, swallowed more than seventy people in one stroke
 duniya ne rasinic bam kaa khoonkhaar cheharaa phir ek baar dekha
 President Assad ordered the attack to be considered by the White Helmets organization, and no one else, but Syrian President Bashar al-assad himself, ordered the showering of this most horrific death from the sky
 insaanon kii banaai is duniya main insaanon ke hi haathon banaae gaye is khaufnak hathiyaar yani rasaounik bam ko apane hi logon par giraane kaa hukum unka apana hi netaa de rahaa tha
 The attack took the life of innocent children, the smallest children who were the easiest victims of this chemical attack, who had just stepped into this world of elders
 bacchon ko saans lene main sabase zyaada dikkat hone lagi
 Wherever he was, he began to faint
 pehle dam ghuta or phir khun kii ultiyaan hone lagi or chand minuton ke andar hi saanson kii door tuutane lage
 Hospitals were full of helpless and sick people
 bacchon ko doctorl taur-tareeqon se saans dene kii koshish shuru kii gai
 But there was no strength in front of this deadly gas
 hamale ke peeche syrian raashtrapatikuch logon ne gas kii tapish kam karne ke liye thande pani kaa sahaara liya
 Which brought immediate relief, but life was scarce
 syria main maanavadhikaron ke liye kaam karne vaale sanghathanon ke saath america kii maane to is hamale ke peeche koi or nahin balki khud syria ke raashtrapati bashar al asad hi hai
 Russia and Iran supported him in this attack
 america raashtrapati donald trump ne donon mulkon ko dhamkaate hue kaha he ki unhen isaki keemat chukaani hogi
 US President Donald Trump said "many people have died in an unintended chemical attack in Syria
" marane waalon main auraten or bachche shaamil hai
 That chaotic region is under the occupation of the Syrian army and it is difficult to reach the outside world
 raashtrapati putin, rus or iran jaanavar bashar al-asad ko samarthan dene ke liye jimmedaar hai
 They have to pay a big price for this
 'rus ne aaropon ko khaarij kiyahalanki khud syrian fuj ke saath-saath unke raashtrapati bashar al asad ke haq main vidrohiyon par hamalaa karne vaale rus ne in ilzaamon ko sire se khaarij kar diya he
 According to Syrian media, after this poisonous attack on the city of Dome, the city was also attacked with 8 missiles
 sthaneey media ne is missile hamale kaa shaq america par jataayaa he
 According to media reports, the attack took place close to central Syria
 khabar he ki is hamale main kai logon kii maut hui he
 However, the Pentagon has said that the Assad government is dragging the US into these attacks to distract from the issue
 syria ne bataaya america propegandavhin duusari taraf rasinic hamalon kii khabar ko lekar syrian sarkaar ne saaf kiya he ki ye america propeganda or ek jhooth ke sivaa kuch bhi nahin he
 
 kyonki aatankwaadiyon ke garh main sena puri takat se aage bad rahi he or wo in ilaakon par jald hi kabza kar legi
 In such a situation, he does not need any chemical attack
 syria kaa daawa- nahin tha rasaynic hamalajbaki rus ne ek bayaan jari kar ye khulaasa kiya ki hamalaa beshak syrian fuj ne kiya he, lekin ye rasaynic hamalaa nahin tha
 Rather, the military's missile mine fell on the largest warehouse of terrorists loaded with chemical weapons in Shikhaun, causing the accident
 sabase zyada rasinic hathiyaar syria ke passhak he ki duniya main sabase zyada rasinic hathiyaar isi syria ke paas he
 And the people of Syria are currently on the streets against their own leaders and the leaders of the same people are poisoning them from the sky to crush the voice of the people on the same road
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath bharat ke number van news channel ‘ajtak’ ke dobaaraa shuru hue flagship sho ‘sidhi baat’par pahunche
 Here, he answered the questions of the show's anchor Shweta Singh in a deft manner
 is dauraan unhone hindu yuva vahini dwaara gundgardee karne ke aaropon ko sire se khaarij kiya
 In the 'sidhi Baat' program, CM Yogin said that the Hindu Yuva Vahini is not doing hooliganism
 upi police ko aparaadhiyon ke khilaaf ection lene kii puri chhot he or hindu yuva vahini ke gundgardee karne kaa ek bhi maamla nahin he
 When asked if the police is not covering the hooliganism of Hindu Yuva Vahini, then why did the police of the state cover the case in any case? The police have complete freedom to deal with anyone who takes the law in hand
 unhone kaha ki agar hindu yuva vahini kii gundgardee ke maamle saamne aate hai, to karrwai kii jaaegi
 Action has already been taken
 siem yogine kaha ki hamane pradesh ke andar ek lakshmana rekha khinchi he or kanoon ke nazariye main koi bhedbhaav kisi ke saath nahin he
 At the same time, he also warned that if anyone takes up the law, there is no concession for it
 kya upi main brand modi yaa brand yogi kamazor ho rahaa he? is sawaal ke jawaab main yogi adityanath ne kaha, ‘brand modi desh kaa ek brand ban chukaa he, modiji kaa koi vikalp nahin he, loksabhaa chunaav rashtriya muddon par ladaa jaataa he sthaneey muddon par nahin
 Secondly, we have tried to do something good in the state within this one year, all these things will be counted
 ”'sidhi baat' par yogi adityanath ne saal 2019 main uttar pradesh main 80 siten or puure desh main 400 se zyada loksabhaa seat jeetne kaa daawa kiya
 At the same time, Yogi Adityanath said in response to another question that he tried to give a better environment to the people of UP in the last one year

 Chandrababu Naidu may have won a small political battle by passing a law allowing the Kapu community a five per cent reservation in education and government jobs from the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly, but is the verdict from the assembly elections due after 18 months Will the court be able to survive first? The validity of reservation for the Kapu community is rarely seen in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision that reservation should not be more than 50 per cent

 Why did Manjunath take such a hasty step without waiting for the report of the Commission, when it was he who appointed the commission to investigate it? unhone kapu samudaay se vaada kiya he ki ve centre ko aarakshan kanoon ko naunvi anusuchee main daalane kaa suzav denge
 Naidu cites the case of Tamil Nadu, where reservation has been increased to 69 per cent
 yah sab kuch chunaav kii drushti se mahatvapurn kapu samudaay (27 fisadi) ko khush karne or telugu film star tathaa kapu netaa pawan kalyaan kaa samarthan paane ke liye kiya gaya he

 aap ke 20 vidhayakon ke masale par dilli vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta ne kaha ki mananeey nyaayalay ne 20 vidhayakon ko asthaayee raahat di he or chunaav ayog ko unhen dobaaraa sunne kaa nirdesh diya he
 The fact that the 20 mlas have not been exonerated cannot be ignored by the fact
 unhone kaha ki mananeey nyaayalay ne mul vishay laabh ke pad ke maamle ko or raashtrapati kii anushansa par koi sawaal khadey nahin kiye hai
 Vijender Gupta said that we respect the decision of the Hon'ble High Court
 ayog main sunwaayee kii lagbhag dhai varsh kii avadhi main chunaav ayog dwaara 12 se bhi adhik baar sunwaayee ke avasar die gaye, parantu jaanboojhkar inhen nazarandaaj kiya gaya

 Criticizing the Aam Aadmi Party, Vijender Gupta said that the party was blaming constitutional bodies like the Election Commission

 He said that the court has directed to hear again
 vidhayakon ko laabh ke pad se dosha mukt nahin kiya
 Manoj Tiwari said that the directive of the Delhi High Court to hear the Election Commission again in the matter of the post of profit on 20 mlas is a unique proof of the independence of Indian democracy and judiciary
 tiwari ne kaha ki bhaajapa ne jis tarah nyaayalay evam chunaav ayog ke pichley nirdeshon kaa swaagat kiya tha, usee tarah ham aaj ke nirdesh kaa bhi sammaan karte hai
 Certainly, the Election Commission should hear again
 saath hi hamen yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chaiye ki nyaayalay ne punah sunwaayee ke liye aavashya kaha he, par unhen laabh ke pad ke dosha se mukt nahin kiya he
 In this case, the counsel for the Central Government, Anil Soni said that in today's order, the court has admitted that the Election Commission did not give full opportunity to the mlas for hearing, so the case should be heard again
 haalanki court ne yah bhi kaha he ki offis of profit kaa cese banataa he or chunaav ayog is par sahi sunwaayee kar rahaa tha
 Central government lawyer Anil Soni said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that the relief given by the court to the AAP mlas does not prove that the court has considered them innocent in the Office of Profit
 is maamle main ab philhal chunaav ayog ke paas do vikalp he, pehla wo sabhi 20 vidhayakon ko dobaaraa notice karen or unhen sune or doosraa hycourt ke aaj ke aadesh ko supreme court main chunauti den
 For now it is a relief for Aam Aadmi Party mlas as in today's order, the court has canceled the Election Commission's recommendations sent to the President
 lekin yah aakhri faisla nahin he, balki dobaaraa is maamle main chunaav ayog offis of profit ke cese main sunwaayee karegaa or dobaaraa yah tay hoga ki in sabhi vidhayakon par offis of profit kaa cese banataa he yaa nahin
 He said that the court has said in its order that the Election Commission has been ordered by the Delhi High Court to hear the matter again

 Baitullah Mehsud has threatened to carry out terrorist attacks in the US after taking responsibility of the Fidayin attack at Lahore's Police Training School
 taharike taliban ke commander batullah mahsood ne yah bhi kaha he ki taliban ab pakistan main har ore apni hukumat kaayam karegaa
 Show the person who has a dabble inside Pakistan
 vaise pakistan ko hamale ke din hi maaloom ho chukaa tha ki iske peeche taliban kaa hi haath he kyonki commando oparation ke dauraan pakade gayi akele jinda aatankwaadi gul khan urf ishrat khan ne kabool liya tha ki wo taharik-e-taliban-pakistan kii ore se hi is mishan par bheja gaya tha
 Pakistan's Interior Security Minister Rehman Malik had also hinted in this evening of the attack
 police ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik hamale ko anjaam dene ke liye wo afghanistan se kuch maheene pehle hi lahore aa gaya tha or manaavaan police training skool ke kareeb hi kiraye par makaan lekar rah rahaa tha
 Police say that apart from Gul, the rest of the terrorists involved in the attack were also Afghans but their helpers were present in Lahore
 hamale kii sajeesh dakshini wajiristaan ke kabaili ilaake main rachi gai or hamalaavaron ko training afghanistan main di gai thi
 It is not appropriate to take Baitullah's threat of an attack on America because it is said that the attack on Lahore is a revenge of the declaration of American reward on Baitullah's head and now the Taliban took the whole of Pakistan to fight against America and the rest of the world
 Desperate to announce haal hi main america ne batullah mahsood ke sir par pachchis karod kaa inaam bhi rakhaa he
 It is believed that immediately after the announcement of the reward, the purpose of several attacks one after the other is to show the strength of Taliban to America
 dollar kii takat se aatank ko kuchalane ke khilaaf america ko ye taliban kii sidhi dhamkee he
 There is a panic warning to stop American help

 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari has targeted Kejriwal over the letter of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki kejariwal drama kar rahe hai
 They have been doing big plays from the beginning
 ye script likhte hai
 They also live in the lead role themselves

 Manoj Tiwari said that after 3 and a half years he feels that Delhi has not got a full state
 isliye kaam nahin kar paae
 He said, 'the people of Delhi are searching for Arvind Kejriwal with bucket in one hand for water
 unhone kaha ki jis colony main ham ja rahe hai ek hi pidaa kii haahaakaar he

 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main congress or rashtravaadi congress party ke bich 15 saal purana gathbandhan todane ke baad, aanan-fanan main samaajawaadee party ko sahyogi banaaya lekin 24 ghante main hi usase naata bhi tod liya
 On Saturday, the Congress announced the names of candidates in 26 seats in its third and final list and made it clear that it will contest all the seats in the state
 congress ke is rukh par maharashtra sapa ke mukhiya abu aasim azmi ne congress par dhokhaa dene kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha 'congress se hamaari 8 siton ke liye baat hui thi, jabaki 3 siton par maamla atka tha
 i got a call from the Chief Minister at 12 o'clock on Friday night
 He was told that the high command in Delhi has not yet accepted the decision on seat sharing, after which i asked what to do
 
 
 kya main samajhuun ki gathbandhan nahin ho rahaa he, to pradesh adhyaksh ne phone lekar kaha haa kuch aisa hi samaj sakate hai'
 ' abu aasim aazmi ne congress par peeth main khanjar ghonpane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki 'hamase 77 logon ne tikat kii maang kii thi
 If the Congress had heard its decision earlier, we would have distributed the ticket
 abu azmi ne ye bhi kaha, 'maine kabhi congress kii nitiyon kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 Our priority was to stop the bjp-shiv Sena
 ' Saturday was the last day for filing nominations
 maharashtra main 15 oktober ko matdaan hona he
 The Congress's alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party was broken after the first list was released
 iske baad congress ne aath siton par samaajawaadee party se gathbandhan karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 The father of that schoolgirl was a Rashtriya Janata Dal worker
 unka kaam lalu kii party ke liye ghoshnaaen karnaa tha
 Hearing this, the girl started crying
 uske pita apana rajnatik rang badalane ke liye majaboor ho gaye
 Before the assembly elections, Nitish Kumar was visiting the state, so the father and daughter met him
 yah bihar main matadaataaon ke badalane kii koi iklauti misaal nahin he
 Not surprisingly, the 2010 assembly election was a unique Bihar election
 pehle se hi andaja lag gaya tha-chunaav par najar rakhane waalon se lekar matadaataaon tak ko-ki nitish kumaar dobaaraa satta main aa rahe hai
 Despite this, this mandate is unique because it gave the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) unprecedented and tremendous success
 pehle is rajya ko bikhri or banati hui raajnneeti kaa sthaan mana jaataa tha lekin aaj yahaan sirf rajg hi rajg he
 The NDA, led by Nitish Kumar, won 206 out of 243 seats in the Bihar Legislative Assembly
 yani vah 85 fisadi siton ko jeetne main kaamyaab rahaa
 Nitish himself occupied 115 seats, which is just seven seats short of the majority
 yah bihar kii raajnneeti main ab tak kii sabase badi chunavi jeet he
 Obviously, everyone is amazed by this spectacular victory
 nitish kumaar ko 2005 main kaaphi had tak lalu virdohi bhaavana kii vajah se janadesh mila tha lekin 2010 kii kamyaabi kii vajahen bilkul alag hai
 Now the voters are supporting him by seeing the work, they have become the only reference for him
 nitish kumaar kii jeet bihar main pehali misaal ban gai he ki kis tarah vikaas or sushasan jati kii raajnneeti par haaavee ho sakate hai
 At the political level, Nitish Kumar's idea of sub-nationalism hurt the identity politics dealers like Lalu Prasad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan
 isane congress ke joardaar punaruutthan kii yojanaon par pani pher diya
 But Nitish Kumar's victory is related to his personality
 agar aap bihar kaa daura karen-gaanv, kasbe yaa jilon, jo buniyadi dhaanche ke maamle neeche se upar ke kram main hai-to milane vaala har vyakti aapako batayega ki nitish bhalemanus hai
 Those who trusted him ignored all the reasons to vote for him
 or nitish ke virodhiyon ko pasand karne waalon ne bhi unhen puri tarah naapsand nahin kiya
 Though he voted for Nitish's staunch opponent, he did not create an anti-incumbency wave
 nitish ke paksh main sirf itani hi baaten nahin hai
 The common man's assessment "has done something" gradually turned into widespread support in favor of the Chief Minister
 kai log ise samaj gaye the par nattejey aane se pehle tak unhen iskaa andaja nahin lag paaya tha
 If seen, Nitish could not fully give the good governance he talks about
 aankadon se pataa chalata he ki bihar vastav main viksit rajya banane se koson dur he
 Per capita income is still the lowest in the state, only 10 percent of the households have electricity, more than 55 percent of the population is living below the poverty line, thousands of people go out of the state in search of employment every year, the government floods Could not handle it properly and Maoists have become a big threat
 par matadaataaon ne sari kamiyon ko spasht rup se khaarij kar diya
 Since becoming the Chief Minister of Bihar in November 2005, Nitish Kumar has also been courting people with his social engineering
 unhone vishesh kalyankari yojanaon ke jariye pichhadon main pichde, daliton main dalit ke saath hi musalamaanon or mahilaon kii ore haath badhaayaa
 Apart from this, he managed to mix his practical politics with his secular identity
 iske alaava, unhone vikaas or saamaajik nyaay ke jariye asaadhya chunavi nattejey ko saadh liya
 Not surprisingly, Nitish Kumar said at the first press conference after a resounding victory, "the voters decided to move forward on the path of progress rather than going backward with old politics
" '' unhone spasht kar diya ki dar par ummid jeet gai he
 This spectacular victory of the NDA can have a wide impact across the country
 haalanki bihar ke mukhyamantri khud ko 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main pradhanmantri pad kii ummidavaari ke ''anicchhuk or laayak nahin'' maanate par lekin min raashi ke 59 varshiya nitish kumaar nishchit rup se desh ke pramukh pad ke laayak logon kii shrenee main aa gaye hai
 Nitish says that he wants to remain frozen in Bihar but one should not be surprised if he starts taking interest in the politics of neighboring states like Uttar Pradesh
 unki jeet kaa sandesh manmohan singh sarkaar ke liye bhi spasht he-yah khel badalane vaale mukhyamantriyon kaa yug he or congress ko chunavi chunauti se nibatane ke liye puri tarah taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 Chief Ministers like Narendra Modi, Naveen Patnaik and Nitish Kumar can dust off the Congress on 87 Lok Sabha seats in their states of Gujarat, Odisha and Bihar on the basis of their charisma and credibility
 jaisaa ki arun jetali ne patna main kaha ki bihar vijay se rajg kaa vichaar shashakt hua he
 The prospect of his resurgence as a truly effective political option has increased
 nitish kumaar ne bhaajapa ke saath rahete hue apni dharmanirpeksh pahchaan banaae rakhi
 They can attract new sections towards the NDA or re-instate sections that have left the alliance
 rajg ko itane bade paimaane par vot lalu ke vot bank khisakane kii vajah se mila he
 But it is also clear from the results that the coalition has also attracted a new class of voters — this is evident from the increase in the number of voters
 pichley saal ke loksabhaa chunaav ke mukaable is baar 7 fisadi adhik matdaan hua
 In addition, women voted overwhelmingly in favor of Nitish
 unka matdaan pratishat kareeb 55 fisadi pahunch gaya
 In 2005, less than 45 percent of women voted
 spasht rup se 10 fisadi adhik matdaan ne chunaav parinaamon ko or prabhavit kiya
 Especially because this time only 50
 7 fisadi purushon ne hi matdaan kiya
 Nitish is filled with these election results
 apratyaashit samarthan kii vajah se pradarshan or ummiido kaa str bad gaya he
 Nitish remains as humble as ever after winning
 aaj bazaar arthvyavastha ke daur main ram manohar lohia ke dhaanche main dhale is samaajawaadee ko bihar ko vikaas ke agle str par le jane ke liye mahaj samaajwaad se pare dekhne kii jarurat he
 Nitish Kumar — who has mastered the combination of conflicting ideologies to implement effective ideas — is a man well-versed in this task

 Due to incessant rains, the game between Bangladesh and South Africa on the fourth day of the second and last cricket test was also canceled without a single ball being bowled
 is test main yah lagaataar teesraa din he jab barish ke chalate match main ek bhi gend nahin phenki ja saki

 Only 88 in this match so far

 aapako bataa den ki barish ke kaaran hi chatgaanv main hua pehla test bhi drow rahaa tha jisamen kharaab mausam ke kaaran aakhri ke do dinon kaa khel nahin ho sakaa tha

 The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council discussed the issue of giving incentives up to Rs 100 to customers purchasing digital medium and approved a new model for single monthly returns and a proposal to make GSTN a government-owned entity
 parishad ne kuch rajyon ke virodh ko dekhte hue chini par upkar lagane ke bare main faisla taal diya
 The 27th meeting of the GST Council was chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley

 After the meeting, Jaitley said that except for a few exceptions, all taxpayers should be required to file a single GST return in a month
 is samay unhen masik str par kai ritern daakhil karne padate hai
 He said that the return filing dates should be sorted based on the business of the registered person to manage the load on the IT system
 compojishan dealer va shunya lenden vaale dealron ko tremasik ritern daakhil karne kii suvidha milani chahie
 Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said that the monthly return file system will become effective in six months and the current system of filing returns through GSTR 3B and GSTR 1 form will not continue for more than six months

 We have come to the 23rd issue of the Job Series
 yatra aage bhi jari rahegi
 If we ask for data from all the states, then you will find that more than a million jobs are stuck in court cases
 zaruri nahin ki court ke kaaran hi lambit hon, kai baar jaanch puri na hone ke kaaran bhi ye naukariyaan fansi hui hai
 Hardly any examination is complete without allegations like brokerage, rigging, paper leaks, wrong questions
 ye sab na ho to bhi bahut si parikshaayen farm bharne ke baad nahin hoti hai
 In many cases it takes from one year to 4 years to complete an exam
 in chayan aayogon kii parikshaon kaa data jod lenge to pataa chalegaa ki inhone milakar karodon chaatro kaa bhavishya barbaad kar diya he
 We told about the state of the selection commissions examinations of several states in the job series, no one responded
 centre sarkaar ke tahat aane vaale karmchaaree chayan ayog ne bhi jawaab nahin diya magar jab chaatr vahaan pahunch gaye, dharna dene lage, to chairman ne kaha ki enditivi bhadkaa rahaa he
 While these students did not gather outside SSC for the first time
 isse pehle bhi kai baar jamaa ho chuke hai
 Then chairman Khurana did not say that NDTV is provoking
 jabaki pehle kaha tha ki koching vaale in chaatro ko bhadkaa rahe hai
 Hopefully, Khurana saheb should not say that Ravish Kumar has provoked the home minister of the country, Rajnath Singh, who has said that the CBI will be investigated
 yahaan tak to phir bhi chalegaa magar khurana sahab yah na kah den ki koching mafia ne grahamantri ko bhadkaa diya
 CBI investigation is not enough, if the government studies the ability to conduct SSC exam, get the results and give the joining letter, then it will know what is happening there
 tay samay main jaanch puri nahin hui to is jaanch kaa bhi matlab nahin
 If the examination hangs with the help of investigation then it is also no use
 chaatro ke aarope sahi hai yaa nahin, ab jaanch se hi sabit hone vaala he
 The government has agreed to them
 hamane unki maang ko zarur rakhaa magar aaropon ke detail main nahin gaye kyonki yah hamaari samaj or kshamta se baahar tha
 Ashim Khurana should have avoided saying that NDTV is provoking students
 trol karne kaa tarika purana ho chukaa he or mujhe koi fark nahin padataa
 During the job series, we have told the story of rigging of various types of selection commissions in addition to the Staff Selection Commission
 23 episod tak bataate rahe
 The youngsters are already performing in different parts of the country, newspapers and TV did not cover them
 akhbaar karte the magar bheetar ke panne main kone main khabar laga dete the
 While youngsters also buy and study newspapers
 maine zarur hairaani jataai ki in chayan aayogon main naujavaanon kii zindagi se khilne kii himmat kahaan se aati he
 Exams have been stuck for four years, the exam has been held but the result is not coming, the result has come but the joining has not been done
 maine zarur kaha tha ki bharat ke yuvaaon kii raajnneetik chetana karaab nahin hoti to kisi ayog ko himmat nahin hoti ki unki zindagi ko barbaad kar da
 i definitely said that the Hindu Muslim Topic running on TV is turning the youth into garbage heaps
 maine zarur kaha tha ki kya bharat ke yuva itane gaye guzare hai ki un par ek se ek beyimaan pariksha vyavastha lad di jaae
 Did the mothers of India decide that to riot their boys by showing Hindu Muslim topics on TV
 kya yuvaaon ne tay kar liya he ki ve ghatiya college main padhenge kyonki aage chal kar dangai bananaa he
 i have said this not to provoke, but to save lakhs of youth from rioting
 pradhanmantri ne bhi kaha he ki 2022 tak sampradayikta khatm kerani he
 You tell the youth, in which prime time news channel of the country, you have seen 27 episodes on the poor condition of the university, 23 episodes on which country's channel on the condition of jobs
 yah kaam maine naujavaanon ko bhadakaane ke liye nahin, balki bataane ke liye kiya ki tum hameshaa hameshaa ke liye barbaad kiye ja chuke ho
 All the ways of getting out of this waste have been closed forever
 8 janvari or 17 janvari ko hamane esayssi ke chairman ko patr likhaa
 His pa's mail also came that give the number
 kaha gaya ki jab samay hoga to intervyuu karenge
 Aashim Khurana was also called
 magar ve intervyuu dene kaa saahas nahin juta sake
 Calling the dock media and saying that NDTV is provoking and understanding that the arrows have hit, it may be their thinking
 hamane apni siries ke dauraan kai baar khurana sahab kii tarif bhi ki ve hamaari series ke dabaav main 11,000 se adhik naujavaanon ko jwining letters de rahe hai
 If he wanted, he could also praise me in return, but no problem
 iske liye khurana ji kaa shukriya
 Until these students gathered outside the SSC, no leader spoke for them
 jab ye apni zid par aa gaye tab dhire-dhire bolne lage
 Shashi Tharoor tweeted, met Jitendra Singh, Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, Randeep Surjewala held a press conference, Yogendra Yadav has visited many times, BJP mps Manoj Tiwari and Meenakshi Lekhi also visited, were they even provoked by NDTV Tha, Khurana Saheb was doing politics, he was not meeting the protesting students, meeting the leaders of Akhil Bharti Vidyarthi Parishad
 khayr milanaa padaa na, sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh to dena hi padaa
 Demonstrations were started in other districts to support these students
 aapane prime time kii naukari series main dekha hoga ki iske shuru hone se pehle kya haalat thi
 The merit list for SSC 2015 and 15 examinations came in August 2017 but none of the 15000 youngsters got a joining letter till the start of our series
 koi in naujavaanon ko jawaab tak nahin de rahaa tha ki jwining hogi yaa nahin
 During our series, they started receiving joining letters
 abhi tak sabhi ko nahin mila he
 Many examination people are calling when our letter will arrive
 kaayade se khurana ko phone kar unhen bataanaa chahie ki aapkaa letters is taarikh ko aayega
 You go to those houses and ask if i am wrong or SSC is wrong
 2016 main centre sarkaar ke diopiti vibhaag ne aadesh jari kiya tha ki bhartee kii sari prakriyaayein 6 maheene ke bheetar puri kar lee jaaen
 SSC should give the same report to the public
 agast 2017 main merit list aa gai, march 2018 tak abhi bhi hazaron chaatro ko jwining letters nahin mila he
 More than 3000 youth have been waiting for joining for seven months after appearing in the merit list
 hamaari series ke dauraan 11000 aise pareshaan chaatro ko yaa to apointement letters mila, milane kii prakriya shuru hui yaa kader alot hua
 About 1000 youngsters have received provisional appointment letters for data entry operator in CAG department
 kuch log isamen se jwining bhi kar chuke hai
 Estimate the mental anguish of crores of students of the country
 dena bank ne 300 pio ke liye april 2017 main farm mangaaye
 The fee for the farm was 400 rupees
 11 june 2017 ko pariksha honi thi magar uske kuch din pehle radd kar di gai
 February 2018 has passed, form-fillers are asking when will that examination take place
 usee tarah central bank of india ke 700 se adhik safal ummidavaar lagaataar likh rahe hai ki agar 31 march tak unki bahaali nahin hui to unka riselt shunya ghoshit ho jayega
 As of now, the bank is not giving them the joining letter
 march kaa maheenaa aa gaya
 Understand the mental anguish of these 700 successful candidates
 esayssi ne stenographer grad si or grad ke 354 padon ke liye 16 june 2017 ko vigyaapan nikaala
 The first date came out from 4 to 7 September 2017, extended from 11 to 14 September 2017
 likhit pariksha kaa riselt 21 november 2017 ko aa gaya
 After that they have to have a skill test for which the date has been fixed 4 January 2018
 uske baad soochna aati he ki pariksha sthagit kii jaati he
 It is still postponed
 chaatro ko pataa nahin chal paa rahaa he ki agali pariksha kab hogi, kyon abhi tak ataki he
 The comments 21 november ko rigelt aayaa, farvari 2018 biit gaya
 Skill test examination is not known in three months
 aap sochate honge ki esayssi kaa hi ye haal he
 DDA took out vacancy in March 2016 for the post of Junior Engineer
 may 2016 main farm bhare gaye
 Its fee was 558 rupees
 may 2016 se march 2018 aa gaya
 Nothing is known about this test
 hamane pataa kiya ki to unke piaaro mahinder paal singh ne bataaya ki edsil agency sarkari orgenigeshan he, vahi pariksha karaati he
 She appoints by taking the exam
 kar rahe hai
 Assistant Account Officer is doing according to the section officer category
 kaaphi kar chuke hai
 Now only 2-3 categories are left
 uske baad junior ejeeniyar kaa karenge
 It will be reported in the newspaper
 abhi koi date fiks nahin he
 We have an agency, Ad Cell has given it to them, the same people will do it
 2018 main pariksha ho jaaegi
 New new agencies are conducting exams, we do not even know about them, but students know everything
 ab aapane dekha ki may 2016 main farm bhar kar koi 2018 tak kaise intazaar kar saktaa he
 When this is the case with DDA, what will be the rest of the hole? sibiai jaanch hi kaaphi nahin he, esayssi kii pariksha karaane, riselt nikaalane or jwining letters dene kii kshamta kaa hi sarkaar adhyayan kara le to use pataa chal jayega ki vahaan kya ho rahaa he
 If the investigation is not completed within the time, then this investigation also does not make sense
 agar jaanch ke sahare pariksha latak gai to iskaa bhi koi laabh nahin
 Whether the allegations of the students are true or not is now being proved by investigation
 sarkaar ne unki baat maan lee he
 We kept their demand but did not go into the details of the allegations as it was beyond our understanding and capacity
 asheem khurana ko yah kehane se bachanaa chahie tha ki chaatro ko enditivi bhadkaa rahaa he
 The way to troll is outdated and i don't mind
 hamane naukari series ke dauraan karmchaaree chayan ayog ke alaava tamaam tarah ke chayan aayogon kii dhaandhlee kii kahani bataai he
 Stated for 23 episodes
 noujvaan to usase pehle se hi desh ke alag alag hisson main pradarshan kar rahe hai, akhbaar or tivi inhen cover nahin karata tha
 Used to do newspapers but used to put news in the inner pages
 jabaki noujvaan bhi akhbaar kareed kar padhate hai
 i certainly wondered where the courage to play in the lives of youth in these selection commissions comes from
 chaar-chaar saal se parikshaayen ataki hai, pariksha ho gai he magar riselt nahin aa rahaa he, rigelt aa gaya he magar jwining nahin hui he
 i definitely said that if the political consciousness of the youth of India does not deteriorate, no commission would have dared to ruin their lives
 maine zarur kaha tha ki tivi par chalane vaala hindu muslim topic naujavaanon ko kachare ke dher main badal rahaa he
 i had definitely said that the youth of India have gone through so much that they should be put on one dishonest examination system
 kya bharat kii maanon ne tay kar liya ki tivi par hindu muslim topic dikhaakar apane laadalon ko dangai bananaa he
 Have the youth decided that they will study in a poor college because they are going to become rioters later
 maine yah baat bhadakaane ke liye nahin, lakhon yuvaaon ko dangai hone se bachaane ke liye kahi he
 The Prime Minister has also said that communalism has to end by 2022
 aap noujvaan hi bataa den, duniya ke kis desh ke news channel ke prime time main aapane uniwarsity kii badahaal haalat par 27 episod dekhe hai, kis desh ke channel par 23 episod naukariyon kii haalat par dekhi he
 i did this work not to provoke the youth, but to tell that you have been ruined forever
 is barbaadi se nikalne ke saare raste hameshaa ke liye band ho chuke hai
 On 8 January and 17 January, we wrote letters to the Chairman of SSC
 unke pie kaa mail bhi aayaa ki number dijie
 It was said that when it is time, we will interview
 asheem khurana ko bhi phone kiya gaya tha
 But they could not muster the courage to give interviews
 godi media bulaakar kah dena ki enditivi bhadkaa rahaa he or yah samajhnaa ki tir maar liye hai, yah unki soch ho sakati he
 We have also praised Khurana Sahab several times during our series that he is giving a joining letter to more than 11,000 young people under the pressure of our series
 wo chaahate to badale main meri bhi tarif kar sakate the par koi baat nahin
 Thanks to Khurana ji for this
 jab tak ye chaatr esayssi ke baahar jamaa nahin hue tab tak unke liye koi netaa bhi nahin bolaa
 When he got on his stubbornness, he started speaking slowly
 shashi tharur ne twit kiya, jitendra singh se mulaakaat kii, arvind kejariwal ne twit kiya, randeep surajevaala ne press conference kii, yogendra yadav to kai baar gaye, bijepi saansad manoj tiwari or minakshi lekhi bhi gaye, kya in donon ko bhi enditivi ne bhadakaayaa tha, khurana sahab raajnneeti kar rahe the, ve pradarshan karne vaale chaatro se nahin mil rahe the, akhil bharti vidhyaarthee parishad ke netaaon se mil rahe the
 Well, we had to meet the order of CBI investigation
 duusare zilon main bhi in chaatro ke samarthan main pradarshan hone lage
 You must have seen in the prime time job series what was the condition before it started
 esayssi kii 2015 or 15 kii parikshaon kaa merit list agast 2017 main aa gaya lekin hamaari series ke shuru hone tak kareeb 15000 naujavaanon main se kisi ko jwining letters nahin mila
 No one was even answering these youngsters whether joining or not
 hamaari series ke dauraan inhen jwining letters milanaa shuru hua
 Haven't found everyone yet
 kai pariksha ke log phone kar rahe hai ki hamaara letters kab aayega
 Ideally, Khurana should call and tell him that your letter will come on this date
 aap un gharon main jaakar puuchhie ki main galat hum yaa esayssi galat he
 In 2016, the dopt Department of the Central Government issued an order that all recruitment procedures should be completed within 6 months
 esayssi isi kii report public ko de de
 The merit list came out in August 2017, as of March 2018, thousands of students still have not received the joining letter
 3000 se adhik noujvaan merit list main aane ke baad saat maheene se jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 During our series, 11000 such troubled students either received appointment letter, the process of meeting started or the cadre was allotted
 sieji vibhaag main data entry oparator ke liye kareeb 1000 naujavaanon ko provisional apointment letters mila he
 Some people have also joined it
 aap desh ke karodon chaatro kii maansik pidaa kaa andaaza kiijie
 Dena Bank invited forms in April 2017 for 300 PO

 Similarly, more than 700 successful candidates of the Central Bank of India are continuously writing that if they are not reinstated by 31 March, their result will be declared as zero
 abhi tak bank unhen jwainig letters nahin de rahaa he
 The month of March has arrived

 After that comes the information that the exam is postponed

 The students are unable to know when the next exam will be held, why it is still stuck
 tippaniyan The result came on November 21, February 2018 passed
 teen maheene main skill test kii pariksha kaa pataa nahin he
 You must be thinking that this is the condition of SSC
 didie ne junior ejeeniyar ke pad ke liye march 2016 main vekency nikaali
 Forms were filled in May 2016
 isaki fees thi 558 rupee
 May 2016 to March 2018
