 vajah tum ho film ko 2 disambar ko relies hona tha, lekin ab isaki taarikh badhaakar 16 disambar kar di gai he
 Hiten Pantal's film 30 Minutes has been postponed to 9 December while Priyanka Chopra's first Punjabi production Saravanan will be released on 13 January next year
 pehle film 9 disambar ko relies honi thi
 Films are of course different, but the reason for bringing them to the audience for a while is the same: the tight economic conditions created after demonetisation
 vajah tum ho se jude sutara bataate hai, ''film ke sambhavit darshakon main chote shahar ke logon kii sankhya zyada he, or vahaan notebandi se tangi kaaphi he
 Postponing release for a few days will give viewers a little time to recover from the cash crisis

 "haanfate single screen500 ru
 And Rs 1,000
 ke note ko band karne kaa sidhaa asar single screen yani iklaute parade vaale cinemagharon par sabase zyada dikh rahaa he
 These cinemas, which are already suffering from bad condition, are unable to recover from this setback
 dilli-uttar pradesh jone main film distribution kaa kaam dekhne vaale josinder mahajan bataate hai ki pichley teen maheene main dilli main teen cinemaghar band ho chuke hai or halaat is tarah hi rahe to march, 2017 tak yah aankada or aage tak ja saktaa he
 Mahajan says, "due to the current economic crisis, the single screen waist has been broken
 pichley teen maheene main dilli main lokesh, akaash or samraat cinemaghar dam tod chuke hai
 In the coming times, around 10 single-screen theaters like Gagan, Milan and Supreme are seen to be clouded by crisis
 "maujuuda halaat cinemagharon ke maalikon kii qamar to tod hi rahe hai, single screen ke maalik yah bhi kehete hai ki dilli main manoranjan tex ko 20 se 40 fisadi karne kaa faisla bhi baari pad rahaa he
 For such reasons, it has become difficult for them to deduct even the expenses of the staff of the cinema and electricity bills
 phir notebandi ke baad se bank or atm se paise nikaalane kii seemaa tay kar di gai he, aise main log apni buniyadi jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye sangharsh karenge yaa manoranjan kaa rukh karenge
 Mahajan says, "in the kind of situation we are in, it comes first to meet the daily needs, entertainment and that too at the bottom of the list of preferences through theaters
" " unka kahana kisi had tak sahi bhi he
 Since the Prime Minister's demonetisation decision on 8 November, the number of people arriving in theaters has fallen
 trade export atul mohan maanate hai ki filmon kaa bijness 25-30 pratishat ocupency par chalata he
 But after the recession, business has come down between 5-10 per cent
 ve bataate hai, ''choti-choti filmein ataki hui hai, or aane vaale dinon main beficre (9 disambar) or dangal (23 disambar) jaisi filmein aane vaali hai, or inke mote bijness kaa daawa pehle se kiya ja rahaa he
 "however some experts believe that the impact of demonetisation will definitely be seen on their earnings
 mana ja rahaa he ki dangal ke nirmaataaon ko film se 400 karod ru
 Was expected to earn, but now the film might have difficulty reaching that figure

 Similarly, Yash Raj Films has plans to release Ranveer Singh and Vani Kapoor's romantic film Befikre on limited screens
 is tarah badi filmein single screen se kanni kaat rahi hai
 Trade experts believe that the common screen is more common in single screen, while the number of people in multiplexes is more
 multiplex main aane vaale online pement or credit card jaisi suvidhaon se las hote hai, isliye production house samajhadaari dikhaate hue unka rukh kar rahe hai
 Joginder Mahajan says that this will harm the single screen, "it will act like a curse for loss-prone single screen theaters
 ve vaise hi centre or rajya sarkaar kii berukhi kaa swaad chakh rahe hai, isse halaat or kharaab hi honge
 "however, this difference can be clearly understood through two films

 22 crores while earning Rs
 22 crores
 kii laagat se bani dear jindagi lagbhag 40 karod ru
 Has done business of yah film puri tarah multiplex oriented thi
 Atul Mohan says, "here the difference is clearly visible
 dear jindagi ke collection achche aae hai
 The big reason for this is its audience, who chose online booking and credit card
 jabaki force-2 ausat kaarobaar hi kar saki or isaki vajah iskaa single screen focus hona tha
 The reason was that the mass market was suffering from demonetisation
 "nakad bikri baithibollywood se is kadam ko lekar tarah-tarah kii awaajen aa rahi hai
 But the picture of the multiplex is accurate
 piviar cinemaj ke siio gautam datta maanate hai ki bhartiya film udyog par notebandi kaa asar jaahir taur par padegaa lekin ise nakaaratmak nahin kahenge
 "demonetisation is driving customers to buy tickets online," he says, adding that the trend of online booking and use of credit cards at all PVR theaters has seen a tremendous increase
 " multiplex ke maalik maanate hai ki shuruaati dinon main to khidki par tikaton kii bikri main kuch giravat ai thi par online kharid ne isaki bharpai kar di
 "our cash purchases have come down by 20-25 per cent, but online purchases have seen a growth of 55-60 per cent," says Dutta
 "yahi nahin, multiplex darshakon ko cinemagharon tak khinchne ke liye kai tarah ke discount or package ofer ho rahe hai

 '- input bhashaa While the foundation of the Shiv sena-bjp friendship in the politics of Maharashtra is cracking, the Opposition is busy creating new equations and alliances
 loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav se pehle ensipi adhyaksh sharad pavaar ne ek majboot gathjod ke jariye bijepi ko maat dene kaa rodmap banaaya he
 This roadmap has opened the way for the BSP in the congress-ncp alliance in Maharashtra
 bataa den ki karnataka main mayawati se gathjod kaa phayda jedies ko mila tha
 Sharad Pawar is trying to try the same formula in Maharashtra
 wo congress ke saath basapa ko bhi jodna chaahate hai
 However, in the last election, the BSP did not win any assembly or Lok Sabha seat in Maharashtra
 lekin donon chunaavon main uskaa vot kareeb dhai fisadi rahaa he
 In Maharashtra's 2014 assembly elections, the BSP fielded candidates for 280 seats
 inamen se ek bhi seat basapa ko nahin mili thi
 But there were 10 seats where the party candidates managed to save their bail
 in siton par 12 hajaar se 30 hajaar tak vot basapa ko mili the
 While the BSP received 11 lakh 91 thousand 846 votes across Maharashtra
 maharashtra ke dalit matadaata kareeb 12 fisadi hai
 Dalits are a big factor in Vidarbha politics
 vidarbha main loksabhaa kii 11 siten hai

 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ne in siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, the NCP is trying to connect the Congress as well as the BSP
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main teen siten aisi hai jahaan basapa ko ek lakh ke aasapaas vot mili the
 If the three get together, the bjp's winning equations can get worse
 maharashtra main dalit ubhaar ke maahaul ko cash karaane ke liye ensipi basapa ko saath milakar apane sameekaran set karnaa chaahati he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, BJP got 23 seats out of total 48 seats in Maharashtra and about 27 percent votes
 is tarah se vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko 122 siten or 27
 81 percent votes were received
 jabaki shivasena ko 18 loksabhaa siten or kareeb 21 fisadi vot hasil hue the
 Shiv Sena got 63 seats and 19 in the assembly elections
 85 fisadi vot mili the
 The friendship between the bjp-shiv Sena is breaking
 donon dal alag-alag chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, the NCP and Congress are expecting a comeback
 isi ke maddenjar sharad pavaar ne basapa ko saath lekar chunaav ladane ke sanket die hai
 If the opposition coalition brings the right seat sharing formula, there could be a lot of breach in the seats of the ruling BJP and Shiv Sena

 bhartiya cricket ke itihaas ke sabase sunahare panne likhane vaale is captain ne sabit kar diya ki unki kamyaabi mahaj takadir kii mohataaj nahin lihaaja vah sirf mukaddar ke hi sikandar nahin hai
 Born on July 7, 1981, Dhoni will celebrate his 30th birthday today
 disambar 2004 main apane pehle antarrashtriya match main bangladesh ke khilaaf jab vah shunya par out hue to kisi ne sochaa bhi nahin hoga ki ek din ranchi kaa yah ladkaa chakka lagaakar bharat kii jholii main vishwa cap daalega
 Dhoni, who gave India the reign of Test cricket, also saw the world in the Midas Touch Test, ODI, T20 and IPL
 dhoni kii kamyaabi ko kismat kii kaarigari maanane se inkaar karte hue unke pehle coach keshav ranjan banerjee ne kaha tha, yah baat saraasar galat he ki maahi kii safalataa sirf uski kismat acchhee hone ke kaaran he
 i have seen him working hard
 vah aaj jis mukaam par he, uskaa shrey uski mehnat ko hi jaataa he
 Dhoni, who once dreamed of becoming a footballer, started playing cricket by chance and today it would not be an exaggeration if it is said that he is the biggest boon to Indian cricket after Sachin Tendulkar
 bharat ne 2007 main dhoni kii captaini main tii20 vishwa cap jeeta to kai logon ne ise tukka kahkar khaarij kar diya
 After this, what happened in the next four years changed the perception of everyone
 bihar cricket team ke saath 1998-99 satr ke jariye gharelu cricket main padaarpan karne vaale dhoni kaa chayan 2004 main kenya daure ke liye bharat-e team main hua
 Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh, the two great stars of Indian cricket who made history in the World Cup final against Sri Lanka on April 2, 2011, were first encountered in the 1999-2000 Cooch Behar Trophy
 dhoni ne us toornament kii 12 pariyon main 488 ran banaae, 17 kaich liye or saat stump out kiye
 Four years later, he got a chance to play the first ODI against Bangladesh on 23 December 2004 in Chittagong but he was run out on the first ball
 pehle chaar match main vah koi kamaal nahin kar sake lekin pakistan ke khilaaf vishakhapattam main khele gaye paanchaven match ne sab kuch badal diya
 Dhoni scored 148 runs in 123 balls
 isi saal srilanka ke khilaaf naabad 183 ran kii pari kheli
 His outstanding performance in ODI cricket earned him a place in the Test team
 vah 2005-06 ke satr ke ant main isisi vanade ranking main shikhar par pahunche
 Dhoni was the Man of the Series in the series against Bangladesh after the team's first round exit in the World Cup 2007
 iske baad england daure ke liye unhen upakptain banaaya gaya
 In September 2007, he was selected as the captain of the Indian team in the first T20 World Cup, and with this, Indian cricket found a leader who does not lose weight in difficult conditions and knows the fun of winning the losing bet
 dakshin africa main pehle tii20 vishwa cap main bharat ne chir pratidwandvi pakistan ko haraakar khitaab jeeta
 After this, Dhoni was also named captain for the seven-match ODI series against Australia in September 2007
 australia ke khilaaf nagpur main november 2008 main khele gaye chauthe or aakhri test ke jariye vah test team ke bhi captain bane
 Anil Kumble, who was injured in the third Test, announced his retirement and Dhoni was chosen as his heir
 dhoni kii captaini main bharat disambar 2009 main isisi test ranking main sheersh par pahunchaa
 Dhoni topped the ICC ODI batting rankings for a long time in 2009
 us saal unhone 24 pariyon main 70 kii ausat se 1198 ran banaae
 Ricky Ponting scored only that many runs in world cricket that year but he did it in 30 innings
 captain kool dhoni kii ek or saugat vishwa cap 2011 main khitaabi jeet rahi
 The moment India had been waiting for 28 years, it came with a six hit by Dhoni's bat

 The story of Dhoni, who signed a three-year deal for Rs 210 crore in July 2010 with Riti Sports Management and Mindscape, seems no less than a fairytale
 ek samay railway main tikat sangraahak kii naukari karne vaale dhoni ko time patrika ne 2011 ke sabase prabhavi 100 logon main shaamil kiya
 The times have changed, if not changed, then the courage to never give up, which makes Dhoni stand in a different group

 Film: Jai Ho democracydirector: Bikramjit Singh Bhullar and Ranjit kapoorstar Cast: Om Puri, Annu Kapoor, Seema Biswas, Satish Kaushik, Adil Hussain, Grisha Kapoor, Aamir Bashir, Benjamin Gilani Duration: 96 minutescertification: u / a Rating: 1
 5 starbharat pakistan ke sambandhon, yuddh or border ko lekar kaifilmemben chuki hai
 Most of the films are serious but this time, along with the border, an attempt has been made to satirize our ministers and rules
 ab kya ye vyangy safal he yaa vifal, aaie pataa karte he
 The story takes place on the border of India Pakistan, a stupid incident
 yah ghatana to aap film , or uski vajah se news channel khabar chalaanaa shuru karte hai
 It reaches the ears of the ministers and then a committee is formed which tries to conclude on this subject according to the rules of the constitution
 ab kya javaanon kii is betuki samasya kaa hal ye mantri baithak ke dauraan nikaal pate hai? isi ko pradarshit karne kii koshish kii he filmkaar ne
 The committee of ministers comprises Kripashankar Pandey (om Puri), Ramalingam (annu Kapoor), Harfool Singh Chaudhary (satish Kaushik), Mohini Devi (seema Biswas), Major Barua (adil Hussain), Mrs
 Bedi (rajni Gujral)
 film kii shuruyaat main abraham linkan , mahatma gandhi ke loktantr sambandhit kathanon ko darshaya gaya to laga kii kaaphi rochak kahani hogi
 The moment a stupid incident happens on the border, it seems that this film will be full of entertainment
 haalanki jaise-jesefilm aage badhati haikahani dhili padane lagati he 
 Trying to make ministers laugh at anything at the same time, on the other hand, showing news in a very irrational manner creates annoyance
 aakhirkaar film aapako boriyat se bhar detii he
 The 96-minute film starts to look big
 shorgul ke saath saath vyangy ke rup main 'kuch bhi' dikhaaya gaya he
 If we talk about the characters of the film, no character can emerge well due to the weak story
 annu kapur, adil hossain, satish kowshik, om puri, seemaa biswas jaiseshandaar kalakaaron kii phijulkharcheeper aapako bura lagegaa
 In the name of satire, the leaders have been shown to fight, use profanity, watch pornographic films in Parliament, and make any point
 sarhad kii samasya kaa vishay mantriyon ke baithak main kahin gaayab sa hi ho jaataa he
 Dialogues make you laugh somewhere like, 'the biggest dream of a military is to go to Chhoti'
 film ke dwaara ek sawaal bhi poocha gaya he kii 'aakhir netaa log apane bacchon ko fuj main kyon nahin bhejte?'kyon dekhen: agar aap anu kapur , om puri , adil hossain yaa satish kowshik ke fain hai to hi dekhen anyathaa paisa or vaqt kisi or kaam par laga sakate hai
 Why not watch: You have been given enough reasons for this
 sonam kapur is samay madhyapradesh ke indore main akshay kumaar ke saath apni aane vaali film 'pedman' kii shooting kar rahi hai

 vahiin naksaliyon ne ek or madhyasth kaa naam bheja he or vah hai hyderabad uniwarsity ke purv professor har gopal
 The Naxalites had earlier named three arbitrators - Manish Kunjam, Prashant Bhushan and BD Sharma
 kunjaam madhyasthata ke liye khud ko taiyaar nahin kar paa rahe hai, vahiin bhushan isse inkaar kar chuke hai, jabaki bidi sharma kaa kahana he ki sarkaar agar koi thos prastaav de to vah donon pakshon ko bithakar baat kar sakate hai
 The comments udhar chhattisgarh sarkaar ne bhi do naam baatcheet ke liye badaye hai
 These include Nirmala Butch, who was the Chief Secretary of Madhya Pradesh and Suyog Mishra, who was the Chief Secretary of Chhattisgarh
 raipur main agava colector kii rihaai ke liye havan or puja paath kaa daur chal rahaa he

 At the same time, Naxalites have sent the name of another intermediary and that is former Professor Har Gopal of Hyderabad University
 naksaliyon ne isse pehle teen madhyasthon- manish kunjaam, pranshaat bhushan or bidi sharma ke naam die the

 yahaan ke logon kaa kahana he ki yah puja−paath naksaliyon ke vichaaron ke badalane kii ummid se kiya ja rahaa he

 In Aaj Tak's special event Mumbai Manthan 2018 session 'four years-how amazing', Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis clearly said that BJP and Shiv Sena are fully together in the state and if there were any disturbances in the relationship between the two parties then they would be the last They could not run the government in this way for 4 years

 If we were not together, the government would not have run

 The Shiv Sena has its own political compulsions, but those who understand politics know that these two parties will have to fight elections simultaneously

 Fadnavis said that Uddhav Thackeray gave a speech on the occasion of Dussehra
 unka puraa bhaashanhindutvapar tha
 Our party runs on Hindutva in the country
 to wo hamaare paas hi aaenge
 This is not a matter of fixing or political compulsion, but today's political situation is such that both parties will have to come together
 fadanvis ne uddhav ke ram mandir k sankalp kaa bhi swaagat karte hue kaha ki uddhav thakare yaa shivasena agar ram mandir ke liye aage aati he to ye acchhee baat he
 Earlier we were fighting for Ram temple, now they are also coming with us, so it is welcome
 donon partiyon ke bich ke gathbandhan main koi dikkat nahin he or jo log pradesh kii raajnneeti ko samajhate hai wo ye jaanate hai
 Fadnavis attacked the Congress and NCP fiercely on this occasion
 unhone kaha ki in donon partiyaan kaa pradesh main koi astitv hi nahin he to ye kaise kisi ke liye khatra hongi
 We have won every election of local bodies, panchayats etc

 However, on this angle, the police is seriously investigating the facts and evidence

 wo esbiai main clerk ke pad se ritair hue hai or umr ke is padaav main aakar unhone apane bare main naa sochakar desh ke javaanon ke prati apana pyaar or sammaan jaahir kiya

 He was hurt by the major attacks on the border in recent times

 Not only India, many countries of the world are facing the threat of Pak sponsored terrorism
 ye sab dekhne or samajhane ke baad unhone faisla liya ki ab wo bhi javaanon ke liye kuch karenge
 In keeping with this thinking, he gave a donation of one crore two lakh rupees to the National Defense Fund, which he deposited after hard work day and night
 janardan bhatta kaa kahana he ki, 2005 main hi unhone ne apni vasiyat bana di thi, haalanki share bazaar main unki ore se kiye gaye nivesh ke jariye wo itani badi rakam jamaa kar paae
 After retirement, when everyone wants to keep the capital in view of his growing age, this step of Bhatt is commendable
 unka kahana he ki desh kii seemaa par ladane vaale javaanon kaa manobal badhaane ke liye unhone ye kadam uthaaya
 Janardhan has spent his entire life helping people
 esbiai main naukari ke dauraan bataur union leader bhi janardan ne apane sahakarmiyon kii samasyaayein sulajhaain
 This is not the first time he has donated such a huge amount somewhere
 isse pehle bhatta or unke sahakarmi ne kisi kii madad ke liye 54 lakh rupee donnet kiye the
 Let us tell you that the government spends the money deposited in the National Defense Fund for the welfare of the army
 isse pehle bhi olympic padak vijeta sina nehwal or abhinayta akshay kumaar jaisi hastiyaan bhi is fund main paisa jamaa kara chuki hai

 The controversy over the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple in Kerala is not taking name
 puure pradesh hinsa kii aag main jal rahaa he
 There were also attacks from home bombs at various places
 police ne hinsa ke aarope main 3000 hajaar se zyada logon ko giraftaar kiya he

 yah pehali baar tha jab koi mahila mandir main pravesh paane main safal hui
 There were various allegations against the women about their motives after entering the temple, although speaking to India Today, the two women denied all the allegations, saying that the whole matter was related to trust and devotion
 unhone kaha ki ve bhagwaan ayappa ke sachche bhakt hai or samvidhan main nihit samaan adhikaron ko barkaraar rakhana chaahate the
 Both these ordinary women of Kerala had an extraordinary determination to live life and understand their rights
 kanakadurga civil supplai vibhaag main karmchaaree he
 She hails from Angadipuram located in Mallapuram district of Kerala

 Both women are proud that they exercised their constitutional rights
 ek taraf jahaan in donon mahilaon ke mandir main pravesh karne ke baad puraa kerala hinsa kii aag main jal rahaa he, jagah-jagah inke khilaaf pradarshan ho rahe hai, vahiin ye mahilaayein kahati hai ki inhen kisi prakaar kaa koi bhay nahin he
 Both women expressed their disapproval over the protests and violence spread across the state
 unhone kaha, 'kerala main jo bhi ho rahaa he usase ham pareshaan hai, lekin ye aise log (hinsa failaane vaale) hai jo apane agenda ko lagu karne ke liye mudde banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 'however, this was not the first time the two women tried to enter Sabarimala
 pichley prayaason ke bare main bolte hue, unhone kaha ki sarkaar or police kaa is safal prayaas se koi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 Because when we first tried, we still lived at our friends' house
 yahaan tak ki pehle prayaas ke dauraan, police ne hamen waapas bhejne kii bhi koshish kii
 When asked how he prepared himself for this despite repeated failures and the violent atmosphere against him, he said, 'we didn't have special preparation, a friend of ours gave us some psychological advice
 'bataa den ki bindu or kanakadurga dwaara sadiyon puraani parampara ko todane ke baad, mandir ke pujari kandaaru rajivru ne ‘shuddhikaran’ karne ke liye mandir kaa garbhagrih band kar diya tha
 The two women expressed their anger at the dogmatic priest's move, saying that they would file a case against a priest
 unhone kaha, 'ham mandir ko band karne vaale or shuddhi karne vaale pujari ke khilaaf kanoonee rup se aage badhenge, yah asprishyata he
 Explain that two women named Bindu and Kanakadurga visited Lord Ayyappa

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Describing Sachin Tendulkar as the Kohinoor of cricket and rich in prodigious talent, Pakistan's great spinner Abdul Qadir has said that it is wrong to pressurize him to retire and he should be empowered to take this decision himself
 newjiland ke khilaaf haalia test shrunkhlaa main naakaami ke baad ek baar phir tendulkar ko kai purv cricketron ne sanyas lene kii salaah de daali he, jinamein pakistan ke purv captain imran khan shaamil hai
 Qadir said, Imran Khan has said that the player should retire after reaching the summit, which is not wrong
 lekin sachin ek khaas khilaadi hai or unka darja bahut ooncha he
 He is not only the Indian but also the Kohinoor of world cricket and they should have the flexibility to decide for themselves how long they want to play
 karachi main 1989 main apane kariyar kii shuruyaat karne vaale sachin ko pehle match main gendbaaji kar chuke kaadir ne kaha, sachin ne cricket ko bahut kuch diya he
 Nature has won him a special skill and such a player is one in an era
 vah watanparast bhi hai or jis din unhen lagegaa ki vah bhartiya cricket ko kuch de nahin paa rahe, vah khud khel ko alavida kah denge
 He said, i would like to say this much to those who criticize Sachin, look at his achievements, his record in the last 20 years
 pakistan ke purv mukhya chayankarta kaadir ne kaha, maine 18 saal antarrashtriya cricket kheli he or main achche pradarshan kaa dabaav samaj saktaa hum
 It is utterly wrong to create such pressure after a poor performance in one or two matches or a series
 har match main koi shatak nahin jamaa saktaa
 The leg-spinner, who has taken 236 in 67 Tests for Pakistan and 132 wickets in 104 odis, said that from the very first match, he had guessed that Sachin is something special
 unhone kaha, karachi main 1989 main vakaar younus jaise tej gendbaaj kii khatarnaak outswing par 16 saal ke sachin ne pair aage nikaalkar drive lagaaya
 Any intended batsman on such a ball will also think about playing a hundred times going forward
 maine tabhi jaan liya tha ki yah ladkaa kuch khaas he
 The comments usee daure par peshawar main ek numaayishi tii-20 match main tendulkar ne 18 gend main 53 ran banaae the, jisamen kaadir ke ek over main 27 ran shaamil the
 "I remember that just before that over, i had bowled a maiden over to the then captain and aggressive batsman of India, Krishnamachari Srikkanth
" uske baad sachin ne meri pehali, duusari or chauthi gend par chakka laga diya
 Mushtaq Ahmed got four sixes in the next over
 unhone kaha, yah cricket ke itihaas ke ek nae daur kii ibtida thi
 Its magnate was Sachin, whose glow has not diminished even today
 unhone cricket premiyon ko itani khubasurat yaaden di hai, to unhen apni marji se khel ko chhodane kaa adhikaar bhi hona chahie
 After his recent Test series failure against New Zealand, Tendulkar has been once again advised by many former cricketers to retire, including former Pakistan captain Imran Khan
 kaadir ne kaha, imran khan ne kaha he ki khilaadi ko shikhar par pahunchakar sanyas le lenaa chahie, jo galat nahin he
 But Sachin is a special player and his status is very high
 vah bharat hi nahin, balki vishwa cricket ke kohinoor he or unhen khud faisla lene kii sahuuliyat honi chahie ki unhen kab tak khelnaa he
 Kadir, who made his debut in Karachi in 1989, bowled in the first match, said, "sachin has given a lot to cricket
 kudarat ne unhen khaas hunar se nawaja he or aisa khilaadi ek yug main ek hi hota he
 He is also native and the day he feels that he is unable to give anything to Indian cricket, he will say goodbye to the game himself

 pakistani sena ke pramukh general raahil sharif is maheene kii 29 taarikh ko ritair hone vaale hai
 This is the first time in the last two decades that the army chief is leaving his post on time without any extension of service in the neighboring country
 raahil sharif ke uttaradhikari ke taur par chaar afasaron ke naam media main chal rahe hai
 But the final decision has to be taken by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who is to hand over the command of the army
 uri hamale or sargical strike ke baad paidaa hue halaat ke bich pichley dinon aisi khabaren aa rahi thim kipakistan kii sarkararmi chif badalane ke mood main nahin he
 The changes at the top post of the Army may be overwhelming amid the heated atmosphere on the outskirts of India and Pakistan, in which speculation was extended to Rahil Sharif
 vaise pakistan ke itihaas par gaur kiya jaae to vahaan kai sena pramukh satta hasil karne ke liye takhtapalat tak kar chuke hai
 The current PM Nawaz Sharif also suffered
 vahiin, 1990 ke dashak main jab navaj sharif duusari baar pradhanmantri bane to tatkaaleen sena pramukh general jahangir karaamaat ko kaarykaal puraa karne se pehle hi ghar bhej diya gaya tha
 Pakistan has a long history of confrontation between the army and the government
 aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf karrwai ko lekar pichley dinon pakistan main sena or sarkaar ke bich tanatani kii khabaren bhi ain
 In such a situation, Nawaz Sharif is blowing this time
 pakistan main sena pramukh kaa pad behad shaktishaalee padon main se he
 The army chief is believed to be stronger than the Prime Minister of Pakistan
 lekin niyukti pradhanmantri kii ore se hi kii jaati he
 The Prime Minister, after consulting the General and Cabinet Ministers, selects the name of the next Army Chief from the list of candidates
 is naam kii sifarish raashtrapati ke paas bheji jaati he, jisapar aupchaarik muhar lagati he
 The new army chief assumes office on the same day the outgoing chief retires
 aakhri vakt tak pattey nahin kholte navajasadhe teen dashak ke siyaasi safar vaale navaj sharif kii sena pramukh chunane kii apni style he
 Nawaz, who became Pakistan's PM for the third time, has had experience with army chiefs
 bataaya jaataa he ki wo aakhri vakt tak pattey nahin kholte ki aglaa army chif koun hoga
 Sharif has worked with eight of the 15 different army chiefs from General Zia to General Sharif
 inamen se general parvej musharraf, general jiyauddin khwaja or general raahil sharif navaj kii taraf se sidhe niyukt kiye gaye the
 However, General Khwaja was later dismissed from the army
 general aphis navaj or general abdul wahid kaakar kii niyukti main navaj sharif kii bhoomika simit thi kyonki us vakt raashtrapati ishak khan powerful the
 Nawaz Sharif appointed Rahil Sharif as the 15th Army Chief on 29 November 2013
 us vakt do senior afasaron ko nazarandaaj kar raahil sharif sena ke pramukh banaae gaye the
 Army chiefs are usually appointed for three years in Pakistan
 agar raashtrapati chahen to pradhanmantri kii salaah se army chif ko seva vistaar de sakate hai
 Service extension also requires formal approval of the President
 raahil se pehle army chif rahe general ashfak parvej kayaani lagaataar chah saal is pad par rahe the
 The process of retiring the army chief is also not small
 ritairement kii taarikh tay ho jane ke baad army chif 'ferewel tour' yani vidaai daure par nikalate hai
 During this time, he travels around the country and meets army officers and soldiers
 raahil sharif kaa bhi ferewel tour bhi shuru ho gaya he
 General Sharif's farewell tour began in Lahore where on Monday he addressed officers and jawans of the Army and Rangers
 sharif iske baad gujranvala gaye jahaan unhone maangala or gujranvala kor ke afasaron or javaanon ko sambodhit kiya
 General Sharif will also visit Karachi and Peshawar soon
 vaise bataur army chif general sharif kaa kaarykaal shandaar rahaa he
 Operation zarb-e-azb in North Waziristan against the tehreek-e-taliban in June 2014 marked the golden period of General Sharif's tenure
 general sharif ko karachi main aatankwaad kaa safaya karne or shahar main shanti behaal karne kaa bhi credit diya jaataa he
 Sharif was honored by 'ABC News Point' as the best military commander in the world for the year 2015
 lekin pichley kuch dinon se sarhad par jis tarah ke halaat paidaa hue hai, use dekhakar lagata he ki agar puraane army chif vidaai or nae army chif kii niyukti shantipurna tareeke se ho gai to pakistan ke loktantr main yah mile kaa pathar sabit hoga

 ) pehle doklam phir uske baad ladakh main bharat-china kii senaayen aamane-saamne huin
 On 15 August, the armies of the two countries clashed near Pengong Lake in Ladakh
 china ke saath lagaataar badhate in takaraavon ke bich ab bharat ke saamne simaaon kii suraksha ko lekar kai sawaal khadey ho gaye hai
 The question is whether the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China will also become like the western border (loc) with Pakistan? Is there a need for constant monitoring and vigilance warning? In Lakh, the temperature in LAC falls to -30 ° c in winter
 haalanki koi post kabhi bhi rikt nahin hui
 In some places there is a decrease in the number of jawans in extreme cold conditions
 lekin ab isamen badlaav ho saktaa he
 Now the level of deployment will be as high as the summer months
 sutron kii maane to LAC gashti kii frequency bhi bad sakati he
 There are approximately 60 patrol points along the border
 saal bhar main aise gasht point kii sankhya or bad sakati he
 The number of troops on the borders has increased manifold in the last decade and a half
 lekin yah dekhte hue ki kuch kamjor kshetron tak pahunchnaa mushkil he, bharat ke paas tainaati ko majboot karne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin he
 However, the eastern areas of Tawang remain a concern
 sutron ne bataaya ki nai dilli sinag, debang ghati or subansari jaise kshetron main bhi najar banaae hue he
 Increased infiltration: An estimated 50,000–75000 soldiers of the Indian Army, guards of the indo-tibetan Border Police guard the border with China
 donon senaaon ke aamane-saamne aane kii sankhya main pichley saal jo giravat ai thi, usamen ab badhotaree ho rahi he
 Till this July, there were nearly 300 infiltration attempts, compared to only 200 last year
 saal ke ant tak iske 500 paar karne kii sambhaavna he
 On August 15, Chinese troops started stonewalling after seeing the failure of the attempt to infiltrate Pengong Lake on both sides
 patharbaji se donon taraf sainikon ko halki chotein aane kii khabar he
 People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers were trying to sneak into the Indian border between 6 and 9 am in two areas, Finger Four and Finger Five, but on both occasions Indian troops failed
 jab chini sainikon ne dekha ki unki koshish asafal ho gai he, tab unhonebhartiya sainikon par pattharfenkna shuru kar diya
 After this, Indian soldiers also threw stones
 ghatana ke kuch der baad sthiti niyantran main aa gai
 Earlier, there has been a conflict between India and China over Doklam for the last two months
 doklam kshetra sikkim ke paas bharat-china-bhutan trijunction par sthit he
 This area falls within the border of Bhutan, but China claims it as Donglong province
 china ne is saal june main jab doklam ke paas sadak banane kii koshishen shuru kin, to bhartiya sainikon ne dakhal dete hue unka kaam rukvaa diya
 Actually, India is committed to protecting the sovereignty of this neighboring country under the agreement with Bhutan
 aise main uskaa dakhal dena laazmi ho jaataa he
 At the same time, China says that it is building a road in its area and has called the intervention of the Indian Army an 'encroachment'
 china tab se hi yudhunmadi bayaan dete hue bharat se apane sainik hataane ko kah rahaa he
 Actually, the place near which China is building the road is very close to the part of what is called 'chicken Neck' of India
 uttar purvi rajyon ko desh ke baaki hisse se jodne vaala yah ilaaka mahaj 20 kilometre chaudaa he or samrik rup se bharat ke liye behad mahatvapurn he
 In such a situation, Chinese activity around this place is also dangerous for India's security

 ) a seven-year-old child disappears while playing in the national capital, Delhi
 ghar vaale, pados vaale, mohalle vaale or yahaan tak ki police vaale uski talash main pehle hi din se jute jate hai
 One week passes
 do haftaa bitta
 The third and fourth weeks also pass
 magar na to kidnaping kii kol aati he or na hi kisi shav ke milane kii khabar
 Then after one and a quarter months, a clue comes out from the neighborhood house in the smell of the child and this clue not only opens the secret of the child, but also reveals the shocking truth of the bloody uncle who treats him like a punk
 
 achaanak gaayab hua bacchabeeti 7 janvari kii shaam kareeb sava paanch baje tak maasoom ashish mohalle kii galiyon main hi khel rahaa tha
 But after fifteen minutes, he suddenly disappeared somewhere
 pehle to logon ko uske gaayab hone kaa pataa hi nahin chalaa, lekin jab tak der tak kisi ne use nahin dekha to bechaini bad gai
 Now the whole neighborhood started searching for the child
 or inamen pados main rahane vaala uskaa munhabola ankal avadhesh bhi shaamil tha
 Complaint with the police and soon the police were also complained in this regard and the police questioned the families and neighbors as well as Uncle Awadhesh, the mole of the child living in the neighborhood
 lekin tab bhi police ko ek baar bhi is baat kii bhanak nahin lagi ki maasoom ashish kii gumshudagi ke peeche avadhesh kaa hi haath ho saktaa he
 Accused himself was a CBI officer, Awadhesh had a very good relationship with the child's family members
 wo naa sirf unke gaanv kaa hi rahane vaala tha balki pehle bachche ke parivaar ke saath hi rahata tha
 Moreover, even in that neighborhood, Awadhesh himself had told the CBI officer and said that he is preparing for UPSC
 usne pados ke kai ladakon ko apni pahunch or power kii badaulat sarkari naukari laga dene kaa jhansa bhi de rakhaa tha
 Needless to say that due to these airmen, Awadhesh had a lot of respect not only in the child's house but also in the locality
 yahaan tak ki bachche ke gaayab hone par wo bachche ke pita ke saath report likhavane thane bhi pahunchaa tha
 Putting the corpse in a suitcase, the police swarmed from the city to the child's village in Bihar
 or phir is tarah ashish ko gaayab hue kareeb maheene bhar kaa vaqt nikal gaya
 On the other hand, the body of the child kept in Awadhesh's room started rotting
 haalanki pakade jane se bachane ke liye qaatil ne tamaam tarah kii koshishen kii thi
 He not only packed the corpse in a polythene packet, but also packed it in a large suitcase and sealed it well
 badboo kam karne ke liye chhidakta tha parafumalekin iske baavjood laash se har guzarate din ke saath badboo badhane lagi
 Neighbors are not suspicious, so he kept spraying different types of perfumes in his room
 lekin jab badboo nahin rukii to usne apane kamare se mare hue chuuhe nikaal kar dikhaae or to or wo har duusare din kamare main chuuhe maar kar chhipaane laga or badboo kii baat chalate hi mare hue chuuhe nikaal kar padosiyon ko dikhaane lagata
 The accused continued to mislead the police, in which the police could not reach him despite being around the killer and Maktool
 is silsile main police ne kai baar avadhesh se poochtacha kii, lekin har baar wo police ko gumraah karne main bhi kaamayaab rahaa
 But after almost a quarter of a month, the needle of suspicion of the police started ticking on Avadhesh
 isaki kai vajahen thim
 The child's sister revealed that now Awadhesh's behavior started changing, he often kept switching off his mobile phone
 ek sisitivi footage main wo bachche ke saath jaataa hua bhi dikhaa
 He had also asked for a bicycle for the child, but refused to tell anyone about it in the house
 ye baat bachche kii bahan ne baad main apane gharavaalon ko bataai
 When the police interrogated Awadhesh for the last time, he broke down in the strict inquiry
 usne kubul kar liya ki usee ne naa sirf saat saal ke ashish ko agava kiya tha, balki agava karne ke ek ghante ke andar higala dabaa karuski jaan le lee thi
 The body was packed in a suitcase
 lekin iske baavjood pakade jane se bachane ke liye wo naa sirf use dhundhane kaa naatak kar rahaa tha, balki usee ne bachche ke pita ke saath jaakar exiaar bhi karwaai thi
 The battle has started in the battle between BCCI vs Lalit Modi
 bisisiai kii ore se pehali chot khaane ke baad ab intjaar modi ke palatwaar kaa he
 There are speculations that if the BCCI can tighten its grip on Modi in the Governing Council meeting, then Modi can also go to court
 ravivaar raat ipel 3 ke final match kii aakhri gend phenki gai or idhar bisisiai ne lalit modi ko ipel se out karne kaa elaan kar diya
 The BCCI Governing Council is scheduled to meet only after a few hours and it is clear that after the suspension from the IPL, the BCCI will now make final preparations to surround Modi
 beshak lalit modi is baithak kaa ab hissaa nahin honge lekin khabaron kii maane to bisisiai ne modi par chaar aarope tay kiye hai
 First, no transparency in the IPL agreement
 doosraa aarope ye ki frenchiji se vasule gaye suvidha shulk board ke khate main nahin gaye
 The third allegation is that Modi made public the official information related to IPL and the fourth charge against Modi is indiscipline
 lalit modi ne bhale hi apane nilamban ke baad khulkar jubaan nahin kholi lekin final ke baad somvaar raat 1 bajkar 22 minute par ajtak se phone par khaas baatcheet main unhone apni aage kii ranneeti kaa ishaara kar diya
 Modi said, 'I am not justified to be removed from the post of IPL Commissioner
 ye ek betuka nirnay he or main is faisle kaa jald hi karaara jawaab duungaa
 Here, the BCCI is preparing to surround Lalit Modi, then Modi is also fully geared up for the next attack
 mana ja rahaa he ki lalit modi bisisiai ke haathon mili apane nilamban ko court main chunauti de sakate hai
 Modi has been saying since the beginning that if there is suspension or dismissal, he will expose many faces
 mumkin he modi kuch dhamaakedaar khulaasa kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, they can also target BCCI convenor n Srinivasan if the news is to be believed
 modi ye bhi daleel rakh sakate hai ki ipel ke har faisle kii jaankaree bisisiai ko bhi rahati he to phir aniyamitata or anushaasanheenata kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta he

 akhilesh yadav mulaayam singh yadav ke bete hai or raajnneeti ke tamaam daanv unhone apane pita se hi siikhe hai lekin satta ke sheersh par hote hue bhi mulaayam akhilesh par baari pad rahe hai
 The stakes that Akhilesh played with Mulayam Singh Yadav, now Mulayam Singh Yadav has put Akhilesh in the fold
 somvaar ko party kabhi na todane kii baat kahakaikhilesh ne apana trump khelaaaur party or netaji ke prati shadyantron kaa hawala dekar apni patibaddhta bhi doharaai
 With this, Akhilesh ended the charges of breaking the party
 ek bhavuk bete ke udgaaron kaa lekin pita par koi asar nahin padaa
 Mulayam Singh Yadav, standing with Shivpal, in his speech described Mukhtar Ansari's family as an honest family, called Amar Singh his brother and said that he had not weakened yet
 mulaayambhole ki unke ek ishaare par saare yuva unke saath khadey ho jaaenge
 It is clear from Mulayam Singh's speech that he does not want to take any kind of attack on himself nor does he want to see any one as overpowering
 akhilesh kii saadhe chaar saal kii satta or pad ko netaji ne khaarij kar diya he
 Ball back in Akhilesh's court, Mulayam Singh Yadav has now bounced the ball back in Akhilesh Yadav's court
 satta kaa abhimaan or party kii maryaada se dur hone jaise bayanon ke zarie mulaayam singh ne saaf kar diya he ki wo kisi bhi tarah kaa samjhauta karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Now the options are in front of Akhilesh to accept the sovereignty of Mulayam Singh Yadav's camp on his knees and relinquish his unilateral right to decide from the party to the government
 agar wo aisa karne ke liye taiyaar nahin hote hai to duusari sthiti yah ho sakati he ki akhilesh party ko choden or apanaaraajanneetik varchasvkhud taiyaar karen
 The biggest challenge for Akhilesh now is how do he recover from Mulayam Singh's blatant tossing and choose the way forward
 raajnneeti main apane vajood ko bachaane ke liye or bane rahane ke liye akhilesh yadav ke paas ab baghawat kaa hi vikalp bachaa he

 iaiti kanpur main guruuvar ko pichley chah saal main chaatr kii aatmahatya ke nauven maamle ke baad iaiti prashasan ek baar phir chatravaas main rahane vaale chaatr chaatraon ke raat baarah baje se subah chah baje tak internet prayog par roak lagane par vichaar kar rahaa he
 However, after the cases of suicide in the institute every year, the officials give the statement that students are under mental stress due to overuse of internet, so their nightly internet usage should be banned
 22 sitambar ko chatravaas main rahane vaale beatech pratham varsh ke chaatr mehataab ke aatmahatya karne ke baad ek baar phir santhaan ke adhikari is kavayad main jute gayi hai
 IIT registrar Sanjeev Kashalkar said that the institute is considering banning the internet from twelve o'clock in the morning to six in the morning to protect the students from mental stress
 haalanki unhone kaha ki is babat prastaav chaatrasangh ke samaksh rakhaa jayega phir ise dean student welfare ke paas bheja jaayegaa
 It will be implemented only after everyone's consent
 register se poocha gaya ki aise prastaav pehle bhi laae gaye lekin abhi tak amal kyon nahin hua
 On this, he said that there is a democratic process (democracy) in the institution, so everyone's consent is necessary
 mehataab maamle kii praarambhik jaanch se pataa chalaa he ki vah internet par kaaphi samay bitaata tha isaliye is baar is prastaav par gambhirtha se vichaar hoga
 Kashalkar said that the entire IIT campus is equipped with wi-fi internet facility and often students in hostels use the internet till late night
 subah jab vah class main aate hai yaa pariksha dene jate hai to vah tarotaaja nahin hote jisase unka man na to padhai main lagata he or na hi pariksha main
 They gradually fall prey to mental stress
 register ne kaha ki iaiti main paanch hajaar chaatr chaatrayen padhate he isaliye prayek chaatr ke kamare main ja kar yah pataa lagaana sambhav nahin he ki koun chaatr soya he yaa or koun nahin
 That is why the administration is considering issuing an order banning the use of internet till late night
 unhone kaha ki july maah main iaiti kaa nayaa satr shuru hua to prashasan ne abhibhavakon ko salaah di thi ki vah pratham varsh ke chaatr chaatraon ko kam se kam abhi laptaap kharid kar na den
 The registrar says that new students do not have any special need for laptops
 jahaan tak internet par kaam kaa sawaal he to santhaan main computer centre he, librari or sabhi vibhaagon main bhi internet or vaai faai system uplabdh he
 Students can go and work there
 lekin santhaan kii is raay par bhi amal nahi hua or anek naye chaatr chaatraon ke paas laptaap he
 Sources in the iits say that many students continue to work on the internet on their laptops till four in the morning and after that they only reach for classes or exams after taking two to three hours of sleep
 neend na puri hone ke kaaran vah tanaav main rahete hai or parchaa bigadane tathaa number kam aane par aksar aatmahatya jaisaa aatmghaatee kadam uthaate hai
 The registrar says that counseling has also been made in the institute for the students so that if they have any problem, they can come and discuss about it
 yoga kendra, khelkud kaa maidan or anya mannorajan ke saadhan bhi hai jahaan jaakar chaatr apana man bahala sakate hai
 Significantly, in the last six years in IIT, nine students have committed suicide due to mental stress

 Be it the US President or someone else, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in clear terms that Kashmir is our internal matter, do not interfere in it
 amit shah ne chikhali, buldhana main ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue ye baaten kahin
 Amit Shah said that over 40 thousand people died in Kashmir for 70 years due to terrorism
 iske baavjood bhi congress or ensipi apni vot bank kii raajnneeti ke liye 370 ko hataane kaa virodh karti rahi
 But for the BJP, the security of the country is more important than our governments, so we removed 370
 NCP congress parivaravaadi partianmit shah ne kaha ki ensipi-congress apane parivaar ke liye chalane vaali party hai jabaki bhaajapa desh ke liye chalane vaali party he
 The people of Maharashtra have to decide what party government they want
 amit shah ne kaha ki maharashtra main aagaamee 21 taarikh ko chunaav hona he
 Both the camps are standing in the electoral arena
 ek ore narendra modi ji ke netritv main bhaajapa or shivasena he, duusari ore ensipi or congress he
 'work for the development of sons' Amit Shah said that Buldhana district is very important not only for Vidarbha and Maharashtra but also for the whole country, as it is the birthplace of Mother Jijabai
 bhaajapa vidarbha ke vikaas ke liye, maharashtra ke vikaas ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 The Congress and NCP are working for the development of their sons
 sharad pavaar, supriya sule, ajit pavaar or unke bete, sabhi maidan main hai
 In the 'corruption is sacrament' rally, Amit Shah attacked the alliance of Congress and Nationalist Congress Party
 amit shah ne kaha ki bhrashtachar congress or ensipi kaa sanskaar he
 i tell all of you with the claim that Narendra Modi ji and Devendra Fadnavis ji cannot accuse even our opponents of corruption
 aisi paardarshee sarkarein dene kaa kaam bhaajapa ne kiya he
 Amit Shah said that all the governments of the Congress had done injustice to Vidarbha
 bhaajapa ne vidarbha ko nyaay dilaane ke saath-saath use vikaas ke raste par aage le jane kaa kaam kiya he
 We have developed the entire Maharashtra, that is our culture
 ayodhya vivaad par ucch nyaayalay ke faisle ke baad janata dwaara shanti or sadbhaav banaaye rakhane par santosh vyakt karte hue kendra sarkaar ne kaha ki is faisle kaa karyanvayan aaj nahin hone ja rahaa he isliye adalati faisle par tippanee karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Union Home Minister p Chidambaram said that this decision, though important, is not going to be implemented today
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bhi kaha he ki is samay sahi nishkarsh yahi he ki jab tak maamle par ucchtam nyaayalay vichaar nahin karata, yathasthiti barkaraar rakhi jaaegi
 He hoped that in the coming days, some party will appeal to the Supreme Court and the apex court will take cognizance and issue an interim order
 chidambaram ne kaha ki ayodhya vivaad par faisle ke baad desh bhar main kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti bani rahi or shanti kaayam rahi
 There is no news of any incident from anywhere
 sarkaar is baat se santusht he ki janata ne faisle ko kaaphi maryaadit dhang se liya
 He clarified in response to a question that yesterday's decision had nothing to do with the incident of the demolition of the Babri Masjid on 6 December 1992
 babari masjid dhahaaye jane ko kisi bhi tarah se uchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 In my view, it is a criminal matter
 chidambaram ne kaha ki media bhi kal ke faisle kii jarurat se zyada vyakhya kar rahaa he
 i would urge the news channels to take less time to explain the decision and appeal to the newspapers to give less space for it
 mayawati sarkaar dwaara kanoon vyavastha kii koi sthiti bigadne kii sthiti main jimmedaari kendra kii hone ke bare main diye gayi kathith bayaan par unhone kaha ki kanoon vyavastha kaayam karnaa uttar pradesh sarkaar kaa kaam he or kendra is kaam main uski madad kar rahaa he
 Even if it is the case that maintaining the law and order is the work of the Center and the Government of Uttar Pradesh is helping it, then it is fine
 sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav dwaara faisle ke aane vaale samay main asar ko lekar kii gayi kathith tippanee par chidambaram ne kaha ki hamen kisi tarah kii koi ashanka nahin he
 We are doing our work and that is to maintain law and order
 ham ise bakhubi kar rahe hai
 Presenting the progress report of his ministry in September, he said that after the decision there was a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security and the Prime Minister appealed to the countrymen to maintain peace and harmony
 is baat kii khushi he ki pradhanmantri kii is apil par janata ne sakaaratmak jawaab diya he
 Chidambaram said that in view of the decision, 52 companies of central paramilitary forces were provided to Uttar Pradesh, of which 40 companies belong to CRPF and the rest to RAF
 unhone bataaya ki ardhsainik balon kii kuch companiyon ko apaat sthiti ke liye taiyaar rakhaa gaya he
 The Indian Air Force is also ready to carry paramilitary forces or troops to any disturbed area

 Rajasthan High Court has taken a tough stand in this case, prohibiting former Congress MP from Jaipur Mahesh Joshi and former Union Minister Bhanwar Jitendra Singh from staying and facilitating in any government guest house outside the state
 congress ke kaddavar netaa or rahul gandhi ke behad najdiki bhavar jithendra singh par dilli ke rajasthan house ke 35 lakh or mahesh joshi par 9 lakh rupee bakaayaa he
 Both of them are accused that during the Gehlot government of the Congress, they booked a room in Rajasthan House in Delhi for five years in their own name, but are not depositing money despite the Rajasthan House notices many times
 haalanki is list main kareeb 10 logon kaa naam he jinke kam paise hai or wo paise jamaa karwaane ke liye raji ho gaye hai, magar purv saansad mahesh joshi apane upar nau lakh rupee ke bakaae ko galat bataate hue kaha ki is maamle ko aage chunauti di jaaegi
 However, Joshi said that in this case, he is neither directly party nor has he received any notice from Parliament
 joshi ne kaha, 'is state guest house main agar baqaaya he to rajya sarkaar ko pehle bataanaa chahie tha, mujhase ek baar poochna chahie tha, court main sarkaar ne sahi dhang se daleel nahin di
 i welcome the High Court order

 On the other hand, former minister Bhanwar Jitendra Singh has said that he never lived in Rajasthan House
 alvar rajgaraane ke purv maharaaja kaa kahana he ki unka makaan dilli main he to bhala wo rajasthan house main kyon rukenge
 Bhanwar Jitendra Singh termed the state government's attitude of withdrawing dues as politically incorrect

 Narendra Modi once again became the Prime Minister of the country by winning a historic victory in the Lok Sabha elections and smashed political opponents
 chunaav jeetne ke baad bhartiya janata party ne apane kor agenda ko lagu kiya or jammu-kashmir, ram mandir jaise masalon par kaam shuru kiya

 Look at similar issues
 
 1
 satta ke mahanayake narendra modi2019 chunavi saal rahaa
 In the Lok Sabha elections that lasted from April to May, Narendra Modi emerged as the biggest leader once again defeating political opponents and then won the election on his own
 2018 main disambar main madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan ke nateezon ne bhaajapa ko jhatka diya tha aise main 2019 kii shuruyaat bhaajapa ke liye shandaar nahin thi
 But Narendra Modi once again proved his opponents wrong on the basis of electoral charisma and the strategy of partner Amit Shah
 23 may ko aae nateezon se pehle jitne bhi survey aae usamen bhaajapa bahumat se dur thi, lekin jab nattejey aae to har koi hairaan ho gaya
 The BJP alone crossed the 300 mark, the NDA reached over 350
 narendra modi ek aisi gaiyr-congressi sarkaar ke pradhanmantri bane jo lagaataar do baar bahumat ke saath satta main ai
 Out of many such issues including Rafale aircraft stains, bad economy debacle, demonetisation, Narendra Modi created such an environment that the entire election issue changed and the atmosphere became more like Modi vs Opposition
 jisamen narendra modi kii mahajit hui

 jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 kaa hatnadesh kii azaadi se lekar 2019 tak jammu-kashmir kaa mudda desh main sabase upar rahaa
 When Jammu and Kashmir was merged, there were certain conditions in which certain rights were granted to the Valley under Article 370
 lekin narendra modi 2
 0 overcame this issue in the Lok Sabha session even before his tenure
 kendriya grih mantri amit shah 5 agast ko loksabhaa main ek prastaav lekar aae, jisamen jammu-kashmir se 370 kaa hatana, rajyon kaa bantwaaraa or centreshasit pradesh banane kaa prastaav tha
 Before the bill was introduced on 5 August, the Amarnath Yatra was halted, phone-internet was shut down in Jammu and Kashmir and politicians were detained
 ghati main suraksha badhotaree ke saath hi raajnneetik halchal badi, vipaksh ne sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa lekin kisi ko khabar nahin lagi ki kya hone vaala he
 The government had a majority in the Lok Sabha but did not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, yet the BJP easily passed this bill in both houses
 31 oktober, 2019 se jammu-kashmir, ladakh alag-alag centreshasit pradesh ban gaye
 The BJP has so far been blaming the Congress for accepting Jawaharlal Nehru's mistake
 puure saal chai rahi modi-shah kii jodi3
 In the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the Bharatiya Janata Party made many such stakes which were shocking
 inamen se sabase bada tha party ke adhyaksh or chanakya maane jane vaale amit shah kaa gandhinagar se chunaav ladanaa
 The seat was still held by LK Advani, the iron man of the BJP, but this time the party did not give him a ticket and was replaced by Amit Shah
 amit shah lakhon voton ke antar se chunaav jitkar aae, isse pehle rajyasabha ke saansad the
 But now he came directly to the Lok Sabha and Modi 2
 0 main grih mantri bane
 After assuming the post of Home Minister, Amit Shah did many things including removing 370, implementing CAB
 bataur saansad shah loksabhaa or rajyasabha main apni upasthiti darj karaate hai or sadan main vipaksh par puri tarah haaavee rahete hai

 amethi main rahul gandhi kii haaracongress ne 2014 or 2019 kaa chunaav rahul gandhi ko aage rakhkar ladaa lekin donon hi baar congress ko buree haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 This time the defeat was worse because Rahul Gandhi lost the election from Amethi, his traditional seat, while being president himself
 bhartiya janata party kii netaa smriti irani ne unhen amethi main chunaav haraaya, isse pehle 2014 ke chunaav main smriti vahaan par haar chuki thim

 Majrooh was born into a Rajput family, so he was also kept away from schooling under dynastic tradition and sent to a madrasa for Dini Talim
 ek intervyuu main unhone kaha tha ki rajput padhane ke liye nahin, ladane ke liye paidaa hote the
 Majrooh became fond of playing football, having achieved the title in Fatwamdarsay when he played football
 lekin ye khel ilm dene waalon ko pasand nahin aayaa or un par fatwa laga diya or unhen baahar kar diya gaya
 Majrooh received Arabic and Persian training from the madrasa
 iske baad lakhanu kooch kar gaye or hikmat (unani medicine) kii padhai shuru kii
 Loved by the Tehsildar's daughter, he came back as Huihakeem and started doing hakimi at Tanda in Faizabad
 yahaan shaayari kaa shauk lag gaya or yah noujvaan shaayar vahaan ke tehseeldaar kii beti ke ishq main pad gaya, jisaki unhen bilkul ijaajat nahin thi
 So, as a result, as the reality was going on, that too, leaving fear of the Tehsildar, Majrooh Sahib had to return to his Sultanpur
 dhire-dhire unki shaayari hikmat par baari padane lagi or wo mashhoor hone lage
 During this time, he made the famous poet Jigar Muradabadi the then master

 The first song of Majrooh, Shah Jahan, was released in 1946 and included Majrooh Sahab's first song 'jab Dil Hai Broke

 'taken

 From pre-independence till the transition from the world, Majrooh Sahib set the example of his fun in all times
 unke dil main sirf mohabbat bhari shaayari ke liye alfaaz nahin the, balki desh ke maujuuda halaat par bhi wo apana kalam chalaate the
 For which he did not have to face family troubles, but had to go to jail

 In one of his poems, he made remarks against Nehru
 ye tippanee nehru or unke vafaadaaron ko badi nagavar gujri
 Therefore, Majrooh was told to apologize to Nehru
 lekin majaruuh jid ke pakke
 The threats of power had no effect on him and he clearly stated that whatever he wrote, he wrote it and after this Majrooh was put in a jail in Mumbai for about 2 years

 One center is Bengaluru, the capital of the state itself, the other is Gurugram and the third is Mumbai
 gurugram ke resort main sabhi 104 bijepi vidhayakon ko lekar bijepi (BJP) kii taraf se mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar bies yediurppa date hue hai
 Meanwhile, three Congress mlas are staying at the Renaissance Hotel in Mumbai
 ye vidhayak congress se asantusht or bijepi ke najadik bataae jate hai
 However, Congress (congress) says that all the mlas are in touch with them
 khud mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami ne bhi kaha he ki unki sarkaar ko kisi tarah se koi khatra nahin he
 While both sides are accusing each other of trying to sell and sell mlas
 bijepi ke yediurppa camp ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki oparation lotus is baar safal hokar rahegaa
 According to sources, except two independents, there are 9 mlas who are in touch with the BJP

 Earlier yesterday, two mlas withdrew their support from the congress-jds government

 Former Chief Minister Yeddyurappa on Monday accused the Congress of manipulation and said that he was giving ministerial posts and other greed to some of his mlas
 haalanki janata dal(es) or congress gathbandhan kii sarkaar giraane ke lieinchaar tarah kehalaat paidaa karnaa bijepi ke liye itnaa aasaan nahin he
 This is the reason that despite BS Yeddyurappa's rapture, the BJP leadership is not in a hurry
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki bijepi ke sheersh netritv ne bies yedurappa ko saaf kah diya he ki jab tak rajya main party ke paas uchit sankhya bal se vah aashwast nahin ho jaaegi, tab tak oparation camel ko anjaam dene kii pahal nahin hogi
 Actually, Lok Sabha elections are coming closer
 aise main agar bijepi dobaaraa sarkaar banane se chookti he to phir kaaphi aalochana sahani padegi
 In fact, after the election results in May, BJP emerged as the single largest party with 104 seats
 rajyapal vajubhai ne bijepi ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 The Yeddyurappa government was formed despite not having the 112 seats required for a majority
 rajyapal ne 15 din main bahumat siddh karne ke liye maukey die the
 But the Supreme Court gave a chance for a single day
 bahumat kaa jugad na karne par yediurppa ko istipha dena padaa tha

 The Congress rejected Narendra Modi's allegation that Rahul Gandhi had lowered the dignity of the Prime Minister by attacking the 'ordinance brought on public representatives'
 saath hi aarope lagaaya ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri desh ko gumraah kar rahe hai or apane rajya ko nazarandaaj kar rahe hai, jo baadh ke khatre kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 Reacting to Modi's speech at a rally in the national capital, Congress leader Rashid Alvi said, "rahul Gandhi did not even mention the Prime Minister's name
" unhone sirf adhyadesh ke bare main apane vichaar jaahir kiye
 He did not even ask the government to withdraw it
 alvi ne aarope lagaaya ki vah modi hi hai, jo yahaan us vakt pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii apni tippaniyon se ninda kar rahe hai jab vah raashtra ke hit main vibhinn rashtradhyakshon se neuyork main mulaakaat kar rahe hai
 The Congress leader alleged that the Chief Minister of Gujarat is 'ignoring' the people of his state, who are facing grave danger of flooding
 tippaniyan Alvi said, the people of Gujarat need Modi in the state
 yah durbhagyapurna he ki vah apane hi logon ko nazarandaaj kar rahe hai, jinhone unhen mukhyamantri banaaya tathaa vah dilli main raashtra ko gumraah kar rahe hai
 Earlier today, while attacking Rahul, Modi accused him of lowering the dignity of the post of Prime Minister and asked the people to decide whether the country will run under the Constitution or will run on the will of 'yuvraj'
 pradhanmantri pad ke liye bhaajapa se ummidavaar banaae jane ke baad dilli main apni pratham raily ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne aarope lagaaya, pradhanmantri pad kii garima ko unki hi party ne kam kar diya
 The Congress Vice President has committed the sin of disrespecting the Prime Minister
 rashtriya rajdhani main ek raily main die modi ke bhaashan par pratikriya jaahir karte hue congress netaa rashid alvi ne kaha, rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri ke naam kaa zikr tak nahin kiya
 He only expressed his views about the ordinance
 unhone sarkaar se ise waapas lene ko bhi nahin kaha
 Alvi alleged that it is Modi who is here to denounce Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with his remarks when he is meeting various heads of state in New York in the interest of the nation
 congress netaa ne aarope lagaaya ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri apane rajya ke logon ko ‘nazarandaaj’ kar rahe hai, jo baadh ke gambhir khatre kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 The comments alvi ne kaha, gujarat ke logon ko modi kii rajya main jarurat he
 It is unfortunate that he is ignoring his own people, who made him the Chief Minister and he is misleading the nation in Delhi
 isse pehle aaj, rahul par hamalaa bolte hue modi ne un par pradhanmantri pad kii garima kam karne kaa aarope lagaaya or janata se yah faisla karne ko kaha ki kya desh samvidhan ke tahat chalegaa yaa ‘yuvaraj’ kii marji se chalegaa
 Addressing his first rally in Delhi after being nominated as BJP candidate for the post of Prime Minister, Modi alleged, his party's dignity has been reduced to the Prime Minister's post
 congress upaadhyaksh ne pradhanmantri kaa anadar karne kaa paap kiya he

 After Mamta Banerjee's mega rally in Kolkata, the question is now whether the opposition is really united? On the invitation of Mamta, 44 leaders of 22 parties had gathered in Kolkata in the attitude that even though our hearts may not be found, hands must definitely be found
 mamata banerjee ne modi roko abhiyaan kaa sabase bada shakti pradarshan to kar diya he, lekin netaaon kaa ek manch par ikattha ho janaa or chunaav ke maidan main janaa do alag-alag baaten hai
 Because 'a candidate of opposition' against Modi seems impossible as per the picture so far
 modi ko hataane kaa vipaksh kaa makasad to saaf he, lekin tarika kya ho? kya upi jaisaa formula bane, jahaan vipaksh ke do taqatvar dal aapas main mil gaye hai, lekin yahaan congress gathbandhan main shaamil nahin he
 The Congress is forced to fight in 80 seats alone
 congress ko kai rajyon main bijepi ke saath unase bhi ladanaa he jo modi ko hataanaa chaahate hai
 These include Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Delhi apart from Uttar Pradesh
 in rajyon main trikoniya ladayeemslan 21 siton vaale odisha main congress ko bijedy se bhi ladanaa he or bijepi se bhi
 In Telangana, which has 17 seats, the TRS has been against both the Congress and the BJP
 25 siton vaale andhra pradesh main bhi sirf chaar dinon kii dosti ke baad tidipi or congress kaa saath alag ho gaya, jo milakar bijepi ko vahaan sendhamari nahin karne dena chaahate
 Till a few days ago in Delhi with 7 seats, there was surety for the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party joining the BJP, but now nothing will happen, it is certain
 44 fisadi siton par akelaa mahagathbandhan nahin42 loksabhaa siton vaale jis bengal ko desh ne vipakshi ekta kaa mahaasaagar banate dekha he, vahaan bhi trinmul or congress saath-saath aa jaaen, ye ab tak tay nahin he
 The Left will remain separate from the Trinamool, but it will go with the Congress or will single-handedly join the Trinamool and the BJP on its own, the picture is not clear
 kul milakar tikoni ladaai vaale 9 rajya hai, jahaan kul 237 siten he
 That is, in 443 of the 543 seats, the Grand Alliance alone does not appear to be formed against the BJP
 kahin congress banaam bijepi to kahin congress banaam left14 siton vaale assam main citigenship bill ke baad agypi or bijepi se alag jarur hui he, 11 siton vaale chhattisgarh main congress or bijepi ke saath bispi or ajit jogi kii party saath-saath hai
 In the 20-seat Kerala, the BJP has no special strength, whereas there is a face-to-face Congress-led front and a left-led front
 bijepi ke khilaaf bikharaa vipaksh48 siton vaale maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena ke raste alag-alag dikh rahe hai
 congress-ncp is definitely here
 karnataka, tamilnadu or jammu-kashmir main bhi ladaai main bijepi ke khilaaf vipaksh bikharaa rah saktaa he
 But as if Kolkata was trying to tell that all such issues will be resolved
 bihar main ekajute he mahagathbandhanendie ke khilaaf ekajute mahagathbandhan banane kii sabase sunahari tasviir bihar se dikh rahi he, jahaan congress or modi virodh main khadey duusare kshetreey dal saath hai
 In states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, the Congress will directly fight the BJP
 to punjab main bijepi-akali dal ke saath ke baavjood congress akele un par baari dikh rahi he
 Chaturdashi Tithi is Shraddh on Friday, 27 September
 chaturdashi par sirf unheen logon ke shraadh kiye jate hai jinaki akaal mrity hui ho
 Shraddha is forbidden on the day of those who died naturally
 mahabharat main bhi kaha gaya he ki chaturdashi tithi par unheen kaa shraadh karnaa chahie, jinaki mrityu asamay hui he
 Do Shraddhin on Chaturdashi date, people who died in an accident or due to the bite of a poisonous animal are killed on Chaturdashi date
 amahatya karne vaale log, jinaki hatya hui ho yaa kisi hathiyaar se mare vyakti kaa shraadh chaturdashi tithi par kiya jaataa he
 In the Mahabharata, Bhishma Pitamah had told Yudhishthira in the festival of Anushasan that people who have died in a famine i
e
 those who did not die naturally, should perform Shraddha on the Chaturdashi date of Pitru Paksha
 jinaki mrityu swaabhaavik rup se hui ho unka shraadh is tithi par nahin kiya jaataa he
 According to the pundits, the person doing the shraddh may have to face problems due to the death of those who died naturally on the Chaturdashi date
 kurm puraana main bhi is baat kaa zikr he ki chaturdashi par swaabhaavik rup se mrit logon kaa shraadh karnaa santan ke liye shubh nahin hota he
 Do special shraadh on Amavasya and perform Shraddha on Amavasya Tithi, whose death date you do not remember
 is din parivaar ke sabhi gyaat or agyaat pitaron ke liye vishesh shraadh karnaa chahie

 The Modi government has offered a new deal in front of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who is demanding women's reservation
 is deal main modi sarkaar ne rahul gandhi se mahila aarakshan bill ke saath tripal talaak jaise muddon par sansad main samarthan kaa aahvaan kiya he
 The Congress has also retaliated on this BJP proposal and has questioned the intention of the government
 rahul gandhi ko likhe gaye kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ke patr par congress netaa sushmita dev ne kaha ki 2014 ke ghoshnaptr main teen talaak or halaala kaa nahin, mahila aarakshan kaa zikr tha
 He said that why did Prime Minister Modi not respond to Sonia Gandhi's letter to demand for women's reservation? Sushmita alleged that she had no intention of giving reservation to women and the Law Minister had become a 'dealer'
 darasal, 'muslimon kii party' or teen talaak jaise muddon par muslim mahilaon ke liye aawaaj na uthaane kaa aarope lagaate hue bijepi lagaataar congress party ko ghere hue he
 Meanwhile, on 16 July, Rahul Gandhi wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding the passage of the Women's Reservation Bill in the Monsoon Session starting July 18, which provides for 33 percent reservation for women in Parliament and state legislatures
 rahul kii is maang ke baad bijepi ne ek baar phir gend congress ke paale main daal di
 On Tuesday, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad responded to Rahul Gandhi's letter
 unhone rahul ko likhe patr main ek 'nai deal' kaa ofer de diya
 Ravi Shankar wrote, 'I want BJP and Congress to come together for women's equality and their adequate participation
 is nai deal ke tahat hamen mahila aarakshan bill ke saath teen talaak or nikaah halaala jaise masalon par bhi kanoon kaa samarthan karnaa chahie
 In his letter, the Law Minister also said that issues such as divorce and marriage are not only related to the rights of Muslim women, but there is also a question of respect for them
 rahul gandhi par tanj kasate hue unhone kaha ki rashtriya party hone ke naate mahilaon or unke adhikaar ke sambandh main doharaa ravaiya nahin hona chahie
 Ravi Shankar Prasad also wrote that we appreciate your initiative regarding the Kimhila reservation bill
 sarkaar ye bhi jaananaa chaahati he ki kya aap or aapke sahyogi dal bhi bill kaa samarthan karenge or sadan kii kaarywahi ko baadhit nahin karenge
 Let me tell you that Rahul Gandhi has written a letter to PM Modi on July 16, asking him to bring the Women's Reservation Bill in Parliament, the Congress will fully support him
 yah bill saal 2010 main rajyasabha main paas karaayaa gaya tha
 But this bill could not be passed in the Lok Sabha

 But perhaps the happiest moment for Nitish Kumar's ears was when Prime Minister Modi praised him for providing electricity to every house and said that i congratulate Nitish ji that today he is fulfilling his resolve to provide electricity to every house in Bihar
 
 bihar main har ghar bijli pahunchane kaa kaam rashtriya lakshya ke teen maheene purv pichley saal 31 oktober ko puraa kiya gaya tha
 It is believed that the central government started Nitish Kumar's Har Ghar Bijli Yojana as a lucky scheme
 lekin nitish ke liye sabase sukhad baat yah he ki bijli sudhaar ke unke tamaam daavon ko nazar andaaj karte hue jin pradhanmantri modi ne bijli ko unke kilaaf pichley vidhansabha chunaav main mukhya mudda banaaya tha, usee ko lekar ab vah unki tarif kar rahe hai
 Everywhere in his speech it was asked that 'electricity came, electricity came
 ' baad main bhaajapa netaaon ne mana tha ki bijli sudhaar ke sambandh main pradhanmantri modi ko asal sthiti kaa andaaza nahin tha
 nda's power show in Bihar: Nitish Kumar said- Prime Minister, we assure that we will win 40 out of 40 seats, however neither Nitish Kumar made his demand for special status in Sunday's meeting nor did Prime Minister Modi say anything on this subject
 lekin modi ne nitish kumaar ke bare main zarur kaha ki har ghar shauchalay banane kaa is saal gandhi jayanti tak nitish kumaar ne jo vaada kiya he uskaa wo abhinandan karte hai
 PM Narendra Modi said at the NDA rally in Patna - Your watchman is completely alert, apart from this, he said about the changed Bihar map, how did a hard-working, decent, poor-like personality like Nitish Babu get Bihar out of that old era Removed and given a new direction
 haalanki unhone bhaajapa ke netaaon kaa bhi zikr kiya or kaha ki nitish ji or susheel ji kii jodi ne bihar ko bhavar se baahar nikaal kar adbhut kaam kiya he

 Under the new facilities, he was to get two private secretaries, two personal assistants, two lower class clerks and four commanders
 unhone sarkaar se yah nirnay waapas lene kaa bhi aagrah kiya he
 Nitish Kumar wrote on his Facebook wall on Wednesday, today it became known through newspapers that the Bihar government has decided to facilitate the former chief minister for staffing during the first five years of his post
 aisa prathit hota he ki aaj ke sandarbh main is nirnay kaa laabh keval mujhe hi praapt hoga
 Therefore, i humbly reject this facility and at the same time i urge the government to withdraw this decision

 https: / / t
 co / a2wwd0ydj1 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Three and a half years after the death of Osama bin Laden, the whole world was desperate to know about the people who killed the world's most dangerous and biggest terrorist and that too by shooting him on the head
 wo koun log hai, kaise dikhte hai or aise khatarnaak oparation ko kaise anjaam dete hai
 So now these things will not remain secret because now the person who has intended to open his mouth opened the first shot in Operation Neptune Spire
 pehali baar duniya kisi america faujee ke munh se sunne ja rahi he jo kah rahaa he ki haa, maine maaraa he osama bin laden ko
 That is, three and a half years ago, when pictures of Osama's death emerged on the TV screens all over the world, all the people were watching each and every action with vigor
 koi bhi in tasveeron kaa ek frem bhi jaaya nahin jane dena chahta tha kyonki na jane tasviir ke kis hisse main unhen wo najar aa jaae jise dekhne ke liye tamaam duniya kii nigahen har vakt tivi screen par lagi rahati thim
 And as soon as this operation was completed, the faces of all the peace loving people around the world blossomed with happiness
 oparation neptune spiear kii kamyaabi ke baad america ne na sirf bade hi gupachup tareeke se duniya ke sabase bade aatanki osama kii laash ko thikaane lagaaya tha balki is baat kaa khaastaur par khyaal rakhaa gaya tha ki jaise bhi ho is oparation main shaamil marine or oparation ko dizin karne vaale sena ke bade adhikariyon main se kisi kii pahchaan kaa koi khulaasa na hone paae
 But as soon as this truth is revealed, the whole world is now desperate to know the truth which is buried in the chest of this American Marine
 sari duniya ke saamne aakar robert o nil ne daawa kiya he ki use ab kisi se dar nahin lagata
 He was the one who killed the world's biggest terror
 pakistan ke abtabad ke ek makaan main laden ko aakhri baar dekhne vaale shaks o nil hi the
 He shot three bullets in Laden's head from close range
 america sarkaar ne ab tak is commando kii pahchaan chhupaakar rakhi thi
 But commando Robert o Neill has revealed himself to be interviewing a channel, citing his tightness and governmental neglect
 or ab tak saamne ai jaankaree ke mutabik 38 saal ke robert agle hafte pehali baar america tivi channel fox tivi news ke do apisod ke intervyuu main duniya se rubaru honge
 This decision of the Navy SEAL commandos who have retired from the army to come to the world has caused a lot of stir and uneasiness in the US defense sector
 jis robert o nil ne duniya ke sabase bade aatank kaa khaatmaa kiya aakhir wo duniya ko wo sari baaten kyon bataa rahaa he
 This rule has also been almost destroyed
 duniya jaan chuki he ki apane halaat se ladate ladate wo sakhtjaan faujee ab kamjor pad rahaa he
 Significantly, on May 2, 2011, the world's most wanted terrorist Osama bin Laden was eliminated and with this, America avenged 9 / 11 after ten years
 ab tak ke sabase bade or khataranaak oparation main america ne pakistan main ghuskar osama ko maaraa tha
 osama-bin-laden came to an end in just 38 minutes of operation
 lekin aap ye jaankaar hairaan rah jaaenge ki is 38 minute kii taiyaari 9 saal se chal rahi thi
 From April 1, the people of Delhi will not get any relief in electricity bills
 31 march ke baad bijli ke bill par di janevaali sabsidi khatm ho jaaegi
 There has been no provision for subsidy on electricity in Delhi after 31 March in the Vote on Demands passed in Parliament
 dilli ke mukhyamantri rahe arvind kejariwal ne kaha he ki unhone bajet main is baat kaa prastaav rakhaa tha ki sitambar tak bijli sabsidi di jaae, lekin bijepi or congress ne isko darkinar karke sansad main bajet paas karvaa diya
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh blamed the Congress and BJP, saying that both these parties have connivance with the power companies, due to which the public is upset
 vahiin dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh harshavardhan kaa kahana he ki kejariwal kii 49 dinon kii sarkaar ne janata ko thaga he
 Taking a dig at Kejriwal, Congress leader JP Aggarwal said that he had talked about reducing the electricity bill of all consumers, but later he has cheated the public by adding several conditions
 dilli ke agle vittvarsh ke chah maheene ke liye 18,033 karod rupee kii lekhanudaan maangon ko shuukravaar ko sansad kii manjuuri mil gai
 In the budget passed in Parliament in view of President's rule in Delhi, the provision of subsidy announced by the Arvind Kejriwal government has not been made
 sansad ke donon sadanon ne dilli viniyog evam lekhanudaan maangon ko dhvanimat se paarit kar diya
 It is noteworthy that the budget for 2014-15 could not be passed in the Delhi Assembly before Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal resigned
 kejariwal ke istife ke baad dilli main raashtrapati shashan laga diya gaya, isliye ukt donon vidheyakon ko paarit karaane ke liye sansad kii manjuuri anivaary thi
 Presenting the bill in the upper house, Minister of State for Finance Namo Narayan Meena said, "the 2014-15 budget for Delhi is being presented, wherein the state government has asked for an account to meet the six months of expenditure
" iske saath hi unhone yah bhi spasht kar diya ki kejariwal sarkaar ne jin sabsidiyon kii ghoshnaa kii thi, unke liye nae bajet main koi aavanton nahin kiya gaya he
 According to sources, there is no elected government in Delhi and President's rule is applicable here, so passing the Vote on Account means withdrawing money just to continue government work
 bijli yaa kisi anya mad main chhot dene kaa adhikaar chuni hui sarkaar kaa hota he, isliye jab dilli main nai sarkaar kaa gathan hoga, tabhi vah yah tay karegi ki sabsidi kii suvidha di jaae yaa nahin

 The Mumbai unit of the Congress has asked actor Amitabh Bachchan to refrain from acting as the brand ambassador of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which comes into force from July 1
 mumbai congress ke adhyaksh sanjay nirupam ne ek bayaan main kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi or vitt mantri arun jetali, donon jaanate hai ki sarkaar taiyaar nahin he or na hi jiesti ko lagu karne ke liye buniyadi sansaadhan hai, tab kyon ve amitabh bachchan jaise diggaj kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Nirupam said that he respects the superstar a lot and for this reason wants to caution him when used by the government for GST
 unhone kaha ki 'ek desh ek kar' kaa vichaar tha, lekin jo lagu kiya ja rahaa he vah 'ek desh or chaar kar' he
 Why are Indians being fooled? And why use an icon and their credibility to fool them
 unhone yahaan tak kaha ki amitabh ko bijepi ke har bevakoofi bhare kaaryakramon kaa hissaa banane kii zarurat nahin he
 The comments kuch report ke anusaar, amitabh ne soshal media par pratikriya di ki unhen yah karne ke liye kaha gaya or is vajah se unhone aisa kiya
 In a 40-second video released by the government, Amitabh is explaining the benefits of the new tax system

 ) In Uttar Pradesh, the Bharatiya Janata Party contested in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and won a landslide victory
 ab bijepi kii najar aane vaale gujarat chunaavon par he
 Gujarat is the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah, so there is a question of credibility of these two top leaders
 khabar he ki bijepi gujarat main uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko star prachaarak bana sakati he, or unki lokapriyata kaa phayda uthaa sakati he
 From Har Har Har Modi to Har Har Har Yogi! Before the elections, the atmosphere in Uttar Pradesh was for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after the elections, Yogi emerged as a very popular leader after making Yogi Adityanath as the CM of UP
 yogi samarthakon ne puure pradesh main har-har yogi ke naare tak laga daale
 At the same time, his supporters are demanding that he be made the PM candidate in 2024
 apane faislon ke kaaran yogi adityanath in dinon desh kii raajnneeti ke centre main hai
 Less talk, more work: 50 major decisions of CM Yogi without cabinet meeting Amit Shah, BJP president Amit Shah will stay on Gujarat for two days from 29 March
 ummid jataai ja rahi he ki tabhi star prachaarkon kii final list par manthan hoga
 In this list, along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the names of Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath and other star leaders can be stamped
 gujarat main mishan 150+gauratlab he ki gujarat vidhansabha kii 182 siton par is baar bijepi ne150 se zyada sitenjitne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 So out of the 53 seats in Saurashtra and Kutch, the party aims to win more than 40 seats, BJP currently has 35 seats here
 aae din ye khabar aati he ki aatankwaadiyon kii nakel kasne ke liye sarkaar or suraksha agenciyaan edi-chotii kaa jor laga rahi hai
 Such security arrangements are being made that even Parinda cannot be killed
 phir bhi jab-tab aatank kaa ek dhamaakaa hota he, jisamen sarkari daavon ke parakhche ud jate hai
 In Aaj Tak's sting operation, it was revealed how a terrorist can get a voter ID card and driving license in a few rupees
 yani sarkari bhrashtachar se aatankwaadiyon ko mil saktaa he license tu kil
 Every blast pierces the chest of India and comes out of the blast, the face of the terrorists who have traitors in their minds and ammo of hate in their minds
 aap in chehron ko acchhee tarah se pahachaanate honge
 Abu Jindal, the mastermind behind the 26 / 11 terror attack in Mumbai
 mohammad faseeh, jo indian mujahidin kaa wo aatankwaadi he, jisaki talash hindustan ke do-do rajyon kii police ko he
 And Iqbal Bhatkal, who sits in Karachi and operates the Indian Mujahideen, which is spreading the fire of terror in India
 khunkhaar aatankwaadi abu jindal is vakt mumbai aties ke kaid main he, lekin iskaa voter card dilli ke paas gajiabad main banakar taiyaar ho gaya
 Muhammad Fahis is in jail in Saudi Arabia, but in India he also got a voter ID card and driving license and Iqbal Bhatkal who is sitting in Karachi also got his voter ID card
 jo aatankwaadi mumbai, karachi or saudi arab main hai, unke voter aaidentity card or driving license kaise banakar taiyaar ho gayi
 How these terrorists are getting license to kill in collaboration with government babus and touts
 kaise asli tasviir ke saath nakli pahchaan patr se ye aatankwaadi bana sakate hai nakli passport
 How can the terrorists get shelter in any part of the country with the collusion of officers and babus sitting in government offices and transport offices and brokers sitting outside
 saudi arab kii jail main band mohammad faseeh kaa bana driving licensoatankiyon ke haath main sabase khatarnaak hathiyaar bandook yaa bam nahin balki ye sarkari pahchaan he jo unhen bemauf desh main ghoomane or blast karne kaa hausala detii he
 Muhammad Fasih, a terrorist who set fire to terror in Delhi and Bangalore, is currently lodged in a prison in Saudi Arabia
 lekin ye jaanakar aapke pairon tale jameen khisak jaaegi ki dilli se sate gajiabad main uske naam or photo se ban gayi uski sarkari pahchaan
 The ammo of terror exploded in one mind and the whole city was shaken
 ek ungali pistaul kii trigar par kasi or aatank kii goli chal gayi
 The name of the terrorist who gave such a trailer of fear and horror is Muhammad Fasih
 ji haa, indian mujahidin kaa ye vahi aatankwaadi mohammad faseeh he, jisapar hindustan main kai bam dhamaakon kii sajeesh rachane ke sangeen iljaam hai
 Who was looking for Interpol on the appeal of Hindustan and with the help of Interpol who was arrested in Saudi Arabia
 lekin kya aap soch sakate hai ki saudi arab main giraftaar aatankwaadi mohammad faseeh kaa driving license hindustan main taiyaar ho gaya
 Voter ID cards of culprits in Delhi, Mumbai and Karnataka were signed with the signature of government babus
 to is asuvidhajanak sawaal kaa kadava or khaufnak jawaab aapke pairon tale jameen khiskaa degaa
 The most wanted terrorist of Hindustan is in jail in Saudi Arabia and here in Ghaziabad, located in the shadow of the country's capital in India, his Voter i card was also made and driving license
 bas adhikariyon or unke ishaare kaa intjaar karte sarkari daftar ke baahar baithe dallalon kii ankhon par rupayon kii pattee baandh dijie or phir dekhie ki kaise saat samandar paar baitha ek aatankwaadi gajiabad kaa nivasee ban jaataa he
 Aaj Tak tried to expose this racket through a very secret under cover operation to bring the bitter sip of terror to the Hindustan every day, to bring this dangerous scandal to the country
 paise dijie or kisi kaa bhi license banaviepaise par bikate imaan or afasar-dalal kii sathganth kaa pardaafash karne ke liye ajtak kii team pahunchi gajiabad ke artio offis main
 There is a provision of webcam and on-line system to create driving license on correct identification
 lekin garm jeb kii aanch par kaise sara system pigal jaataa he or kaise aatankwaadiyon ko mil jaataa he license tu kil, ise parakhane ke liye ham is giraftaar aatankwaadi kii photo lekar driving license banavaane ke liye pahunch gayi
 Outside the transport office, a whole group of brokers were gathered and Aaj Tak team reached there with a broker
 dalal ko is aatankwaadi kii photo di or fouran wo form bharkar bagaiyr kisi jaanch padtaal ke hi adhikariyon ke paas pahunch gaya
 After submitting and photographing the form, he asked us to give him a learning license the very next day
 duusare din jab hamen license mila to ham hairaan the ki kaise bina kisi padtaal ke hi ek aatankwaadi kaa license ban gaya
 Aaj Tak's team reached out to the transport office officials who have the responsibility of making and examining the license
 sabase pehle team pahunchi riginal inspector e ke singh or ve ke verma ke paas
 Actually both these officers, AK Singh and VK Verma are responsible for checking the license form
 yahi donon adhikari tay karte hai ki sarkaar kaa ahm license galat naam or pate se jari na ho jaye
 This is the reason when Aaj Tak team told both that the photo on the license is wrong but they were not ready to accept it
 inspector ke pi singh ko jab bataaya gaya ki is license main aapke record main photo badal di gai he
 That is , the photo on the web camera of the RTO was scratched by someone else and the photo has been put on the license by Fasih Mehmood
 is bare main web cam se photo khinchvaane or use veriphai karne vaale artio adhikari wike verma se ajtak team ne mulaakaat kii
 On this, Varma also kept trying to justify himself instead of exposing the racket running with the connivance of officers and touts
 ab sawaal dalal kaa nahin, balki us transport offis kii saakh kaa ho chukaa tha, jisaki daro-diwaar ko rishwat kaa dimak chaat chukaa he
 That is why when Aaj Tak raised the matter of verification of the driving licenses of Muhammad Fasih, the reply of Inspector Sahab was evasive
 maamla sangeen hota dekh baat narendra sharma par aa gayi
 The job of these men is to check the photo in the driving license
 lekin jis vakt aatankwaadi mohammad faseeh kii photo form par chipkaai gayi tab shaayad sharma ji kii aakhen dhokhaa kha gayi
 Abu Jindal also got the government recognition easily
 26-11 terrorists are guilty of showing the way to Mumbai and attacking their country
 wo jindal badi mushkil se pichley dinon suraksha agenciyon ke haath laga
 But the identity of that Abu Jindal was also easily removed from a government office
 ji haa, jis gajiabad main mohammad faseeh kaa voter card or driving license ban gaya, vahiin par abu jindal ke naam par bhi uske photo vaala hi voter card taiyaar ho gaya
 With gratitude to touts and government officials
 kya aap ye yakeen karenge ki begunaahon ko maut baantne vaale is aatankwaadi ke voter idi card bade aasaani se ban sakate hai
 That too is not far away, but it is possible in Ghaziabad, adjacent to the capital of the country, that too from the government office
 aap kaayade-kanoon se chaliye to aapke voter idi card banane main sau adnge aaenge, lekin sarkari baabuon or sarkari daftaron ke baahar ghoomte dallalon kii jeb garm kar dijie, to abu jindal jaise aatankwaadi kaa bhi voter idi card ban jayega
 Abu Jindal's picture is correct, his name is correct, but it became a fake voter card on his name and picture
 ajtak team ne jahaan se aatankwaadiyon ke voter card or driving license banawaye, vahaan police bhi maujuud thi
 But nothing can be seen with open eyes
 aakhir har dalal se in police waalon kii jeb main 300-300 rupee jo jate hai
 This broker himself said this
 dilli se sate noida main bhi paise dekar aap kisi ke naam driving license banavaa sakate hai
 If the paper is incomplete, then 1500 rupees and if it is complete, you need a fake address, then 3000 is the rate
 noida or dilli ke baahar to andhergardi or bhi zyada he
 You do not have to go to the RTO office
 paisa dijiye or sarkari license le lijiye
 More or less the same situation is in Faridabad, adjacent to Delhi, where the brokers take the contract to get the license for Rs 3500
 aatankwaadiyon ko khojate-khojate kai baar police kii filein close jo jaati hai or ye isliye hota he ki aisi hi nakli pahchaan ke jariye iem se lekar lashkar tak ke tamaam aatankwaadi desh main bhesh badalakar gum kar rahe hai
 License to Kill
 upi ke duusare ilaakon kaa bhi he yahi hayefasaron-baabuon or dallalon kaa ye napak gathjod sirf gajiabad main hi nahin chal rahaa he balki uttar pradesh ke duusare ilaakon main bhi ye dhadlle se jari he
 And the biggest proof of this is the becoming of the voter card and driving license of Iqbal Bhatkal, the leader of the Indian Mujahideen
 ikbaal bhatkal to karachi main baitha he, lekin uski photo or naam se pehle farji voter idi card ban gaya or phir license
 Now the officials are not giving any explanation on this
 ikbaal bhatkal ko desh or duniya kii police dhundh rahi he
 According to an intelligence report, Iqbal Bhatkal has been hiding in Karachi for a long time
 lekin sawaal he ki kya aise aatankwaadi ke naam par voter idi card ban saktaa he? aise aatankwaadi ko driving license mil saktaa he?lekin ye ahm sarkari dastavej hindustan ke is faraar aatankwaadi ke naam or tasviir par taiyaar ho gaya or wo bhi isi maheene main
 After terrorists like Muhammad Fasih and Abu Jindal, Aaj Tak's team wondered if their leader Iqbal Bhatkal could also have a driving license and voter ID card
 or kya gajiabad-noida se baahar bhi ban saktaa he
 To test this, Aaj Tak's team reached Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh, where it was found that a person named Madni works to get a driving license and a voter ID card
 ham sidhe madani se takaraae or hamane usko ikbaal bhatkal kii photo dikhaakar poocha ki kya 24 ghante ke bheetar is shaks ke naam driving license mil saktaa he
 In a few hours Madani gave us the voter ID card of Iqbal Bhatkal sitting in Karachi in Moradabad
 lekin driving license ke liye usne kaha ki ise to wo kisi or jile se banavaa degaa
 The next day, at Madani's behest, we reached a shop near Moradabad, where a boy gave us the driving license to drive a heavy vehicle of Iqbal Bhatkal
 license milte hi hamanen gaur kiya ki muhar or license dono hi shikohabad ke transport offis se jari hua he
 But when asked by the RTO of Shikohabad, they said, 'the series it belongs to does not belong to us
 ' ikbaal bhatkal kii siries bhale hi shikohabad ke artio register se mail naa khaataa ho, lekin license or card to yahi bataate hai ki kahin kuch bahut bada gadabadjhaalaa he
 And on this news, the Uttar Pradesh government is also accepting that there is a mess in the system
 soobe ke parivahan mantri kaa maananaa he ki agle ek saal main wo phulpruf intjaam kar lenge taaki kisi khoonkhaar aatankwaadi kii sarkari pahchaan naa bane

 uttar pradesh main haal ke dinon main aparaadh ke kai maamalon main laaparvaahee ko dekhte hue mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne kadaa rukh apana liya he
 After this, there are signs of major changes in the police department of the state
 jaankaree ke mutabik uttar pradesh kaa grih vibhaag aise afasaron kaa kaccha chittha taiyaar kar rahaa he jisase police or sarkaar kii badanaami ho rahi he

 mukhyamantri ne rus ke daure par jane se ek ahm baithak bulaai thi jisamen unhone aise afasaron kaa naam lekar aalaa adhikariyon kii jamkar fatkaar lagaai thi or unhen nirdesh diya tha ki jald se jald aise adhikariyon ko chinhit kar unke khilaaf sakht kadam uthaae jaaen
 Such officers include the captains of several districts from which Chief Minister Adityanath is very angry
 daure par jane se pehle yogi adityanath main pradesh ke grih vibhaag ke apper mukhya sachiv avanish avasthi ko aane vaale 15 dinon tak sabhi jilon kii kanoon vyavastha kii samiksha karne or police kii nakel kasne ke nirdesh die the
