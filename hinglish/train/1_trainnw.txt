 court ke aadesh se yah saaf he ki rajballabh yadav philhal jail main hi rahenge
 The Supreme Court said, this case is related to rape and Poxo Act with a minor
 hamen ye bhi dekhnaa he ki is maamle main fere trial ho
 Yadav said that till the trial is over, he is ready to stay out of Bihar, the bail should not be canceled
 bihar sarkaar ko is tarah hoicourt ke chif justise par aarope nahin lagaana chahie tha
 All such people will come to the Supreme Court accusing the judges
 yadav ke vakil ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar kii tamaam daleelein bebuniyaad hai
 If the accused is MLA then the state government cannot make such allegations
 rape ke saare aarope jhuthe hai or is aarope main kai jhol hai
 At the same time, it was said by the Bihar government that Yadav's bail should be canceled
 teen hafte pehle hoicourt ke jaj ne jamaanat dene se inkaar kiya tha, lekin iske baad chif justise ne jamaanat de di

 yadav kii ore se kaha gaya ki jab tak trial puraa nahin hota wo bihar se baahar rahane ko taiyaar hai, jamaanat radd na kii jaae
 The Bihar government should not have accused the Chief Justice of the High Court as such
 aise to sab log jajon par aarope lagaate hue supreme court aa jaaenge
 Yadav's lawyer said that all the arguments of the state government are baseless
 aaropee MLA he to isliye rajya sarkaar is tarah ke aarope nahin laga sakati
 All the allegations of rape are false and there are many lies in this charge
 vahiin, bihar sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki yadav kii jamaanat radd kii jaani chahie
 Three weeks ago the High Court judge refused to grant bail, but after that the Chief Justice granted bail

 varsh 2007 kii sardiyon main bhartiya congress cameti ke navaniyukt mahasachiv rahul gandhi ne prastaav rakhaa ki yuva congress ke padaadhikari kaa nirvachan ho, na ki unka chayan ho
 Rahul's intention was to open the doors of the Youth Congress to everyone, which till now was limited to only political background or people associated with it
 party ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai, ''ve aise netaa taiyaar karnaa chaahate the jo parivaarwaad se mukt hon or unhen bhartiya rajnatik vyavastha ke rog ne na jakadaaa ho
 Their plan was that when they take over the leadership of the party, this plant of young leaders should be ready to replace the senior team

 However, Satava is one of the 44 members of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, but Arshad could not win the 2014 general election

 The fact that the Congress' confidence in 78-year-old Sheila Dixit, who was ousted from the throne of Delhi, is a sign that Rahul's use of a second line of leaders to replace him after the exit of veteran leaders failed is
 yah bhi ek badi vajah he ki rahul party netritv sambhalakar sheersh str par bahupratikshit pherbadal shuru karne ke maamle main anmane-se hai
 The 2014 debacle gave the party both time and opportunity, but since then it has been running only in reverse gear
 2014 ke chunaav se pehle patrakaron se anaupchaarik baatcheet main rahul ne kaha tha ki ve bhrashtachar ke aaropon se ghire logon ko tikat die jane ke khilaaf hai
 The reference was former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan who later got a ticket and was among the two Congress candidates who won from the state
 ek saal baad unhen rajya ikai kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 Says a member of the All India Congress Committee, "chavan's victory was a lesson for Rahul

 This circular of the registrar provoked the student union

 With the intention of strengthening the protest, JNU students wrote slogans against the VC by creating paintings in various places

 virodh jataane ke liye jeenyu chaatrasangh ne anivaary upasthiti vaale circular kii copy jalaakar visi ko RSS samarthak bataate hue khaaki pant (shakha kii dress) lekar pradarshan kiya
 Students also attended attendees during the protest

 If the reasons for this are investigated, the ongoing hearing in UCO Bank's case provides some good starting points for its analysis

 He is alleged to have given Rs 600 crore to UCO Bank to Hem Singh Bhadana, chief managing director of Ira Infra Engineering

 Incidentally, UCO Bank's track record in recovery of loans associated with npas is quite poor
 yah baat arabiai kii ek report main rekhaankit hoti he
 In a government document about weak public sector banks, it was mentioned that UCO Bank (along with United Bank of India and Indian Bank) specializes in losing money
 report main likhaa gaya, ''pichley saat saal main in teen bainkon main 6,740 karod ru
 Even after investing, their basic weaknesses remain the same

 "this report was written in 1999

 The announcement was made
 saath main yah dhamkee bhi di gai thi ki agar ab bainkon ne kaamkaaj durust nahin kiya to unhen gambhir nattejey bhugatne padenge or yah nishchit rup se aakhri baar he ki bhartiya banking kshetra ko musiibat se nikaalane ke liye janata kaa dhan lagaaya ja rahaa he
 Historically speaking, this thing does not look authentic
 arabiai ne disambar 2016 kii vittiya sthirataa report (ennesaaar) main yah kaha tha, ''isse vaazib taur par yah bahes shuru hui he ki yah duubate dhan ko hasil karne ke liye haath kaa dhan bhi phoonk dene kii koi nai kadi to nahin hogi
 "this debate is really old
 1990 ke dashak ke shuruaati saalon se hi sarkari bainkon ko lagaataar belout, nakadi pravaah, equity ko kam karne yaa sarkaar se or kisi na kisi rup main madad kii jarurat padati rahi he
 a report estimated that between 2000 and 2015, the same amount would be Rs 81,000 crore

 Out of this, between 2010-14, only about Rs 70,000 crore
 kharch hue
 So 2 done last October
 1 lakh karod ru
 The announcement of pouring is actually the same old strategy
 saaf he ki agar is tarah ke belout baar-baar hote rahen to un par punarvichaar karne kii jarurat he
 Cases like UCO Bank are common for public sector banks (psbs), but their problem is not limited to fraud only
 unki ek or badi samasya yah he ki is tarah ke bank satta main baithi sarkaar ke nirdesh par chalane lagate hai
 Hence psb's priorities are often dependent on the policy needs of the government, rather than providing efficient banking services
 masalan, vittiya samavesh kii sarkaar kii yojanaayen—jaise pradhanmantri mudra yojana—ke myne yah hai ki piesbi ko apane staff or sansaadhan ko rin meley yojit karne main lagaana padataa he
 Demonetisation also played a big role in putting psb's human resources into other activities
 jab enpie kaa sankat apane charam par tha, saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon ko notebandi ke kaaran maheenon tak apane staff ko bheed se nibatane main, logon ke gusse ko shant karne main or note ginaney main lagane pade
 This was the reality of demonetisation
 piesbi par thopi jane vaali is tarah kii praathamiktaayen unki akushalta ko or bhi badahaal karti hai
 Then there are issues related to default and expertise on serious issues
 jis str kii pariyojnaayen aaj centre or rajya sarkarein chalaa rahi hai, or jinaki desh ko bahut jarurat bhi he, ve mahaj kisi check ke aage jiro badha dene bhar kaa masalaa nahin hai
 Public sector banks need modern credit risk assessment departments to protect our economy in a meaningful way against npas
 unhen vibhinn kshetron ke udyog visheshgy, (mahangi kism kii) legal timen or chartered acountint chahie or sabase upar to kisi ambani yaa dhoot ke saath hue saude kii bhi gahan chaanbin kar sakane kii ichhashakti chahie
 On this front, there are a lot of reports of defaults in PSB management at every level
 yaa to bina kisi jamaanat athwa equity ke karj de die jate hai yaa phir aadhikarik pariyojna laagat se kahin zyada ke lone manjuur ho jate hai
 An analysis of the Ministry of Finance revealed that many such road projects were given loans before getting environmental clearance or loans were given to those power projects who had not yet decided from where they would buy coal or Then who will buy electricity from them
 lekin ye sari baaten surkhiyon main nahin hai
 In 2014, an RBI committee set up to review the functioning of banks wrote, "banks, the board has no power and are constantly in agreement with the process of selection of directors
" natijatan board kaa prashasan kamjor pad rahaa he
 It is the central responsibility of the central government to bring about a change in this situation with radical reforms
 is tarah ke sudhaaron kaa abhaav he yaa phir sudhaar hote bhi hai to tukdon-tukdon main jinka khaas asar nahin ho paata
 In such a situation, there is no possible improvement in the administration of these banks

 "although the recommendations were partially accepted, including the recommendation of the formation of the Bank Board Bureau (BBB), the current conditions still indicate that we are still suffering that financial cost
" enpie sankat ke liye anya kaaran bhi hai
 For example, a volatile legal environment in which new laws are implemented from the old date are expensive
 yaa jisamen nitiyaan jitani sahajata se banati hai, usee sahajata se palat bhi di jaati hai
 One often suggested solution for unskilled psbs is personalization
 haalanki halaat jitne bhi mushkil hon, is vichaar par baaten aage bad hi nahin paatin
 For example, the government's Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subrahmanyam had said in April that the question of privatization needed a cost benefit assessment
 ''saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon ne dhanchaagat suvidhaon main kaaphi nivesh kiya he
 We should reward them for that
 hamen is baat kaa laagat-laabh moolyankan to karnaa hi chahie ki kya us dhan kaa istemaal karke hamane jo kuch khadaa kiya he usase enpie kii bharpai ho sakati he
 "they also say," but to say that we will be able to give 'instructions' to privatized banks also, this will not be effective
 nijee bank to nijee laabh ke liye hi kaam karenge
 (this is despite the fact that Subrahmanyam himself talked about privatization of banks
 )bibibi ke pramukh vinod raay kii bhi yahi dharna haih ''piesbi ke bina dhanchaagat kshetra ko vah madad nahin milti jo use mili
 Whether they are roads, ports, airports, electricity or telecommunications, all sectors have received major help from psbs
 ''state bank of india ke chairman rajnish kumaar kehete hai, ''bharat kii is samay kii jo saamaajik-aarthik sthitiyaan hai, ve bainkon ke vyapak str par nijeekaran ke liye anukool nahin hai
 May be we can reach that level of development in the next 50 years, provided we continue to grow at the same pace as now
 ''is masale ko dekhne kaa ek najariya niyantran ke sawaal se bhi he
 Subrahmanyam's statement is the closest to what the people in power would naturally put forward: Private banks cannot be controlled in the same way that public sector banks can
 arabiai ke purv dipti governor ke
 C
 chakravarti kehete hai, ''agar aap jokhim prabandhan dhaanche ko nahin badal sakate, swaittata nahin de sakate, to sarkaar ko piesbi kaa nijeekaran kar dena chahie
 There is no need for privatization if the government is able to improve governance and can give autonomy
 ''apane str par bibibi bhi sarkaar ke piesbi par se niyantran chhod dene ke puri tarah se khilaaf nahin he
 Theoretically speaking, the BBB will adopt a more professional approach on bank appointments than the finance ministry — instead of political skill and perception, competence and direct technical skills will be valued
 haalanki piesbi ke board ke sadasyon kii niyukti kaa adhikaar hone kaa matlab he bhartiya banking kshetra ke 80 fisadi se zyada par dakhal hona
 Therefore, whatever may be necessary to persuade the Finance Ministry on the rationale of the above argument, it will not be easy
 hakeekat yah he ki yah sankat bharat kii maranasann saarvajanik kshetra banking pranali ke kai dabe pade muddon ko ujagar kar rahaa he
 a government official says, "everything leading to npas has a contributing factor and the fact that" psbs are also bureaucratic and not business
 " ''sudhaaron kaa khaakaabanking vyavastha ko patari par laane or isaki vishwasaneeyata lautaane ke upaay talashne ke liye 2017 ke november main sarkari bainkon ke purnakalik nideshkon or sheersh padaadhikariyon kii baithak 'piesbi manthan' hui
 It agreed on the following points: 1 - Ensuring that the loan is sanctioned after rigorous examination
 vaise to bainkon ne rin manjuuri ke niyam-kaayade tay kar rakhe hai, lekin badhata enpie sabit karata he ki in par thik se amal nahin hota
 An investigation by the Ministry of Finance revealed that there are many projects related to the highway, which were given loans before the environmental clearance was given
 2-pakkaa karnaa ki karj lene vaale kii balance shit kii gahan jaanch-padtaal ho or nakad pravaah sambandhi suraksha maanak puure hon
 According to Finance Ministry officials, in many cases banks do not have the expertise to check the documents of loan applicants properly
 nateeja yah hota he ki ve hawa-hawaii munaafe or badha-chadhaakar dikhaae ja rahe aankadon ko pakad nahin pate, jaisaa ki kathith taur par essar kii pariyojnaon ke maamle main hua
 Currently, the Essar cases are with the National Companies Law Tribunal (NCLT)
 nakad pravaah ko surakshit karne kaa parinaam yah hoga ki tab yah nigaraanee kii ja sakegi ki di gai raashi kaa istemaal kisi duusare mad main na ho kyonki is baat kaa ullekh hoga ki us raashi ko kahaan kharch kiya janaa he
 3 - To pay attention to non-fiscal and subsequent risks associated with project financing
 gaiyr-koshiya jokhim bank guarantee or letters of credit se jude hote hai
 On the basis of a similar paper flaw, Nirav Modi cheated and thus used the guarantee of one bank to take a loan from another bank
 baad ke jokhim un pariyojnaon se jude hote hai jo lambey samay main puraa hone vaali hoti hai
 In such cases, usually the cost and time are eventually exceeded and the exemption of the permit directly leads to liability conditions
 4-saghan vishleshan ke liye anek niamak database kaa istemaal karnaa or isamen takanic kaa istemaal badhanaa
 In the same way, CIBIL maintains the credit report of any person and the industry board keeps the reports of companies associated with its sector
 rin aavedakon kii di gai jaankaree kii agar in database se pushti ho paae to lone par nirnay karne kii prakriya main suraksha kaa ek or str shaamil ho jayega
 Also, it is possible that banks will also get to know such corporate borrowers who have kept the necessary information hidden
 vitt mantralay ke mutabik, yah baat reliance communications par bhi lagu hoti he kyonki usne bainkon ko is baat kii jaankaree nahin di ki usne china ke rindaataaon se moti raashi le rakhi he
 5-the major banks of any consortium should develop capacity for conducting techno-economic evaluation
 secondary bainkon se akalan or pushti main madad mil hi jaaegi
 The ability of banks to assess risk and monitor it is extremely disappointing
 jis tarah ke project aa rahe hai, unke liye takneekee jaankaree or kshetra kii visheshgyata bahut jaruri he
 As such, they are necessary in terms of risk assessment and their possible economic aspect
 agar koi bank kisi pariyojna ke sambhavit takneekee daayre ko nahin samaj saktaa to vah jokhimon or laagat kaa sahi akalan bhi nahin kar saktaa
 6-250 crores Rs
 se zyada ke rin ke maamalon main paise dene ke baad bainkon ko visheshgyon kii madad se pariyojna kii nigaraanee kerani chahie
 Share the bank information associated with the consortium so that everyone knows the situation
 yah aanshik rup se takneekee-aarthik akalan vaale bindu se judaa he
 Till now, there was no system of special monitoring in the case of large loans, not at all from outside experts
 banker iskaa virodh kar rahe hai
 7 - There will be only nine banks in a consortium and associate banks will have 10–10 per cent participation in a loan
 dekha jaataa he ki koi difolter aam taur par consorcium ke bainkon ke chote bakaaye kaa bhugtan karke badi raashi kii adaayagi roak dete hai or is aadhaar par raahat maangate hai ki unhone kuch bhugtan kar diya he
 Along with this, the management of small consortium will also be easy and since every bank will have a transparent and equal stake in the loan, it will be easier to investigate
 8-consorcium se rin moolyankan kii ek maanak online prakriya ho
 Officials in the finance ministry say that Indian banks (even banks lending to consortiums) often do not have the methodology to share information related to payment delays
 9-rin, uske akalan, nigaraanee or vasuuli kii jimmedaari kaa kaam alag-alag logon ke haath memhona chahie
 In many banks, the entire loan process is done by one or two people
 isse mileebhagat / bhrashtachar kii ashanka bad jaati he or rin dene ke baad jaruri nigaraanee nahin ho paati
 10 - The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code will have to be changed so that NPA account holders cannot repurchase the company during the insolvency process
 isse yah nishchit ho sakegaa ki enpie ke liye jimmedaar pramotor isaki bharpai karen or yah bhi ki ve diwalia companiyon ko coditon ke bhav kharidkar phayda na uthaa saken
 RBI has been authorized to send cases of 11-NPA directly to NCLT
 pehle arabiai ke paas iskaa adhikaar na tha
 The result was that such companies, which he had already declared defaulter, would hang the case with political interference

 However, the government also believes that there are more than four crore families in the country who do not have electricity connection in their homes and are forced to live in the dark
 modi sarkaar ne somvaar ko yah elaan kiya ki ab vah is sthiti ko badalane ja rahi he
 On Monday, in Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the scheme named Saubhagya, on the occasion of the birth centenary of Deendayal Upadhyay, which aims to provide an electric connection to every household
 is yojana kaa shubharambh karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki vah khud mitti tel ke die main pard chuke hai or isliye is baat ko acchhee tarah samajhate hai ki jin gharon main bijli nahin pahunchi he vahaan jindagi kitni mushkil hoti he
 He said that with the Saubhagya Scheme, a target has been set to provide electricity to every household by December 2018 so that no house in the country remains in darkness
 yani 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle modi sarkaar ise ek apni badi uplabdhi ke taur par pesh karnaa chaahegi
 The government has kept a budget of Rs 16,320 crore for the Saubhagya scheme and the central government will bear 60 percent of the cost of providing electricity to every household, 10% will be borne by the state governments and 30% will be taken from banks
 is yojana kii khaas baat yah he ki logon ko apane ghar main bijli conection paane ke liye koi kharch nahin karnaa hoga
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that after the implementation of this scheme, the process of frequent rounds of government offices to get an electricity connection will also stop
 kyonki sarkaar khud logon ke ghar-ghar jaakar bijli conection lagaaegi or un logon kii pahchaan karegi jinke ghar bijli kaa conection abhi tak nahin he
 To make the process easier, mobile app will be resorted to and people will be able to complete all the actions from mobile application to application
 garib logon ke liye bijli conection paane kii prakriya puri tarah muft hogi
 But the rest of the people will also have to spend only ₹ 500 for this and that too will be taken along with the electricity bill in 10 installments
 desh ke doordaraj ilaakon main jahaan har ghar main bijli kaa conection pahunchaana mushkil he vahaan sarkaar gharon ko roshan karne ke liye saura urja kaa sahaara legi or logon ko bydaree, 5 LED lite or ek pankhaa bhi diya jayega
 Before the Saubhagya scheme, the Modi government had run the Ujjwala scheme to provide LPG gas connections to every household, under which connections of three crore cylinders have been distributed so far
 uttar pradesh samet kai rajyon ke chunaav main BJP ko ujwala yojana kaa jabardast phayda mila
 It is believed that by putting full force behind the Saubhagya scheme, the BJP would like to present it as a big success in the next Lok Sabha elections

 (read - Amma who didn't like listening) aisa hi ek charchit vaakya tab kaa he jab jayalalita ne bibisi world ke kaarykram ' 'hardtalk India' ke liye patrkaar karan thapar ko intervyuu diya
 The interview became a topic of discussion as Jayalalithaa did not like some of Thapar's questions
 maamla yahaan tak pahunch gaya ki intervyuu ke ant main jab thapar ne tamilnadu kii siem se haath milaate hue kaha ki aapse baat karke acha laga to jayalalita ne yah kehete hue mike 'patake' diya ki 'lekin mujhe aapse baat karke bilkul acha nahin laga
 ' is intervyuu ko utyub par kai baar dekha ja chukaa he lekin jo nahin dikhaa wo he is intervyuu ke baad kaa hissaa
 In those days, senior journalist Pervez Alam used to be the producer of this BBC program and lived in London
 unhone is intervyuu ko yaad karte hue ek fasebuk post main likhaa he ki chennai main hue ammaa ke is saakshaatkaar ke thik baad karan thapar ko kamare se jane nahin diya gaya
 Let's read what Parvez has written - 'jis din karan thapar ko ammaa ke intervyuu ke baad baahar jane se roak liya gaya
 
 
 i was the London based producer of this BBC World program 'hardtalk India' when in 2004 Karan Thapar interviewed Jayalalithaa for us
 haa, vahi itanravyuu jisaki kaaphi charchaa hoti rahati he
 
 landan main din chadh rahaa tha tab karan kaa mere paas phone aayaa
 He said in a slow voice that it has become difficult in Chennai because Jayalalithaa is very angry with this interview
 yah tanaav tab shuru hua jab karan ne intervyuu ke bich jayalalita se kaha ki vah apane jawaab padhakar na den
 This was their conversation - ke : (tokate hue) aap statement pard rahi hai J: (interrupting) i am not reading
 main aapako dekhakar baat kar rahi hum
 You can see it in the camera
 ke : lekin main kah rahaa hum
 
 je : main aapako dekh rahi hum or baat kar rahi hum
 
 main pard nahin rahi hum K: i want to ask you one thing
 
 People say je : (tokate hue) aapke saaman bhi nots rakhe hai
 Does this mean you are also studying? ke : mere saamne sawaal rakhe hai J: Okay so i have notes in front of me as well
 or mujhe inhen padhane se koi nahin roak saktaa K: Chief Minister
 
 J: i am not reading
 
 
 main aapaki ankhon main aankh daalkar baat kar rahi hum
 i do the same with everyone intervyuu khatm hone ke baad karan thapar ko laga ki unhen jayalalita ke daftar se baahar nikalne se roak liya gaya he kyonki vahaan kuch police adhikari maujuud the jo unhen jane nahin de rahe the
 Eventually, he said the meaning
 je kaa karyaalay chahta tha ki karan yah intervyuu phir se record karen kyonki madam siem is baatcheet or isamen puche gaye sawaalon se khush nahin he
 Karan said i will have to talk to London
 isliye unhone mujhe phone kiya
 The comments is sawaal kaa jawaab naa hi tha lekin maine phir bhi apane bos narendra moraar, kamishning editor, bibisi world se baat kii
 Narendra had the same answer after a discussion with the BBC editorial team
 
 
 naa
 
 ' Parvez further wrote that Karan and his team were let go after some stressful hours
 vahiin is post par chennai main is kaarykram ke produsar rahe ashok upaadhyaay ne likhaa he ki intervyuu ke dauraan thapar or jayalalita ke bich kaaphi tanaav dikhaai de rahaa tha or un par dobaaraa baatcheet record karne kaa dabaav bhi banaaya gaya
 But the good thing was that Jayalalithaa did not get up from the middle of the interview and she faced every question like a lioness

 Karan got a call from me when the day was climbing in London

 Investigations have revealed that the passport issued to Ram Rahim had many rules laid down
 passport main juthi soochna dene ke liye ram rahim par passport act ke tahat maamla darj ho saktaa he
 Both Ram Rahim's passports have been found to have huge deficiencies, which flout the rules
 in tathyon se sabit hota he ki haryana sarkaar or passport karyaalay main tainaat adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ne niyamon kii dhajjiyaan udaakar passport jari kiye the
 In the first passport issued in 2015, Ram Rahim is wearing a cap on his head
 niyamon ke mutabik passport ke liye istemaal kii jane vaali tasviir main topi nahin pahani ja sakati
 According to sources, this passport issued by the Regional Passport Office of Ambala was handed over to Ram Rahim within half an hour
 amuman passport karyaalay 9 baje khulata he, lekin 2015 main ram rahim kaa passport jari karne ke liye videsh mantralay kaa staff subah 8:00 baje hi karyaalay pahunch gaya tha

 pradhanmantri kii safai ke baad ab upie koyala aavanton maamle main vipaksh par javaabi hamalaa karne kii taiyaari main jute gaya he
 In fact, now the UPA is working on a dual strategy - to cut the bjp's publicity among the people and isolate the BJP on this issue in the political fraternity
 ab sawaal yah he ki sansad main chal rahe is hangaame ke baad aakhir rasta kya he
 
 
 The government is considering two things, either the session of Parliament should be postponed indefinitely


 or the government should bring confidence vote in Lok Sabha
 sarkaar ko lagata he ye donon raste bijepi ko alag−thalag or benaqaab kar sakate hai
 That is, the UPA is now ready to completely surround the BJP
 tippaniyan Speaking to NDTV India here, Law Minister Salman Khurshid hinted that the state governments of opposition parties may also come under the purview of the CBI
 kurshid ne kaha ki sibiai jaanch kar rahi he, agar rajya sarkaron par koi aarope lagata he yaa ungali uthati he to sibiai uski nishpaksh jaanch karke saare tathy court ke saamne pesh karegi
 The message is clear
 bijepi yaa to sansad chalane de yaa kisi bhi tarah ke shakti pareekshan ke liye taiyaar rahe

 sarkaar do baton par vichaar kar rahi he yaa to sansad kaa satr anishchit kaal ke liye taal diya jaae


 yaa phir sarkaar loksabhaa main vishwaas mat laae
 The government feels that these two ways can isolate and disparage the BJP

 The comments idhar, enditivi india se baat karte hue kanoon mantri salmaan kurshid ne ishaara kiya ki sibiai kii jaanch ke daayre main vipakshi dalon kii rajya sarkarein bhi aa sakati hai
 Khurshid said that the CBI is investigating, if any allegation is raised against the state governments or a finger is raised, the CBI will examine it objectively and present all the facts before the court
 paigaam saafe he
 BJP should either let Parliament run or be prepared for any kind of power test

 The problem before the government is how to pass a large number of pending bills
 is samay kul 39 mahatvapurn bill soochibaddh hai
 Finance Minister p Chidambaram has indicated that the government will present the vote on account budget paper in Parliament on 17 February
 chunavi varsh hone ke kaaran is samay sansad main bajet nahin pesh kiya ja sakegaa
 Only the new government will be able to present the budget
 samajha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar taxon main kai tarah ke chhot dene kii yojana bana rahi he taaki middle class voter ko vah rijhaa sake
 It is clear from the Vidhan Sabha elections that the middle class of the country is not with the Congress at this time
 isliye use khush karne ke liye kai tarah kii chhot kaa elaan hoga
 Experts believe that apart from giving relief in income tax, the service tax on some services will be removed, hence the finance minister is taking time
 anyathaa vot on acount ke paper to aasaani se taiyaar ho jate hai
 The question is being raised how the fate of so many bills will be decided in just 12 days
 zyaadaatar partiyaan apane-apane kaarnon se in bilon ko paas karaane main koi dilchaspee nahin le rahi hai
 The Samajwadi Party has made it clear that it is interested in passing the financial bills itself
 vaise bhi vah kai mahatvapurn bilon ke khilaaf he
 The Congress intends that the six bills for which Rahul Gandhi is pushing are to be passed somehow
 ye sabhi bill bhrashtachar virdohi hai
 With his efforts, the Lokpal bill was passed in Parliament
 in bilon main bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon (sanshodhan) bill bhi he
 Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj asked in two words why they should support the Congress agenda
 unhone kaha ki ye bill rahul gandhi congress upaadhyaksh kii ichha ke mutabik taiyaar kiye gaye hai or unki party unki ichchhaaon ko maanane ko baadhya nahin he
 Meaning that BJP will not help in passing any of these bills
 telangna par vipakshi dalon ke rukh ke kaaran sarkaar ko sansad chalaane main kaaphi kathinaayee aa rahi he
 Seeing the noise that occurred in the house on the first day, it is not possible that some work will be done in the future
 itane saare bilon ke bare main to ab sochaa hi nahin ja saktaa
 The Telangana bill will be presented in Parliament on Thursday and the Cabinet will consider it before that
 congress kii samasya he ki vah apane kai saansadon ko hi vishwaas main nahin le paa rahi he
 They are opposing the bifurcation of the state
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne kaha ki desh main raajnneetik maahaul party ke ricardtod parinaam hasil karne ke liye bilkul anukool he kyonki congress kii aguwai vaali sarkaar ke bhrashtachar evam mahangaai par kaabo paane main vifal rahane par mukhya vipakshi dal ke liye anukool sthiti bani hui he
 In the meeting of the National Executive of the Scheduled Caste Morcha of the BJP here, he said that before this the political situation in the country has never been more favorable for the BJP
 adwani ne kaha, ‘yahaan anusuchit jati morcha ke kaaryakartaaon ke vishwaas ko dekhakar main is baat ko lekar nishcint hum ki ham loksabhaa chunaav main ricardtod parinaam hasil karenge

 maudrik niti samiti (empisi) kii guuruuvaar tak chalane vaali pehali maudrik samiksha baithak ke pehle hi din supreme court ne bhartiya rigerv bank (RBI) ko bada jhatka diya he
 The Supreme Court has quashed a circular of the Reserve Bank regarding troublesome ledgers
 supreme court kaha ki yah arabiai ke adhikaar kshetra main nahin he
 After all, what is the whole matter and what will be its impact on npas and banks, let's know
 kya tha maamlapichley saal 12 farvari ko rigerv bank ne ek circular jari kar bainkon ko nirdesh diya tha ki ve kisi lone account ke pement dedline ke baad yadi ek din kii bhi diphalt hoti he to use pareshaani vaale yani stressd acount kii shrenee main rakhaa jaae
 The corporate world became very restless due to this circular
 asal main distraped account main shaamil hone kaa matlab yah he ki agar 180 din tak diphalt kaa masalaa nahin sulajhata to iske baad bank difalter company ko baikarpshi court main le jane ko majaboor ho jate
 Earlier, many loan restructuring schemes were introduced to facilitate companies to give more time to pay back loans
 kyon laayaa gaya tha circulansal main inasolvency or bankerpshi code (IBC) aane ke baad rigerv bank ko aisa circular laana padaa
 Prior to IBC, loan defaulters used to dominate, banks gave them more time to repay by restructuring the loans so that they would not have to provision for such loans
 lekin isse samasya or badhati gai
 What happened: After the circular, banks had to keep a large part of their loans under NPA
 isaki vajah se vitt varsh 2019 kii pehali timahi main 21 saarvajanik bainkon ko 16,600 karod rupee kaa ghaataa hua he
 By December 2018, banks' npas rose to around 11 per cent
 kisne kiya virodh27 agast, 2018 ko bijli companiyon ne elahabaad hoicourt main jaakar rigerv bank ke is circular par roak lagane kii maang kii, lekin court se unhen koi raahat nahin mili
 1 above the power companies
 73 lakh karod rupee kaa karj ho gaya tha
 The bill was not being paid by many government departments and the power companies were unable to recover dues of about Rs 34,000 crore from them
 baad main kai or sector kii companiyaan bhi supreme court kii sharan main gayi
 On September 11, 2018, the Supreme Court, while maintaining the status quo in the case, ordered the transfer of all cases challenging the RBI circular
 11 disambar, 2018 ko rigerv bank ke tatkaaleen governor urjit patel ne istipha de diya
 a major reason for his resignation is believed to be differences with the government in the circular case
 7 farvari, 2019 ko rigerv bank ke nae governor shaktikant das ne circular main kisi tarah ke badlaav se inkaar kiya
 But on April 2, 2019, the Supreme Court declared the circular of the Reserve Bank canceled
 supreme court ne kaha ki rigerv bank yah nirdesh to de saktaa he ki diphalt kii sthiti main bank kisi company par karrwai kare, lekin aam karjadharakon ke bare main saamaanya taur par vah aise nirdesh nahin de saktaa
 What banks will do now Even before banks were conscious of the 'difficult' sector or company
 90 din ke diphalt period ke khatm hone ke baad bank sambhavit difalter ke khilaaf karrwai shuru karte the
 However, he was reluctant to make the names of companies or individuals public and go to the Recovery Tribunal
 ab bhi bainkon ko apane stress acount ke liye zyada praavdhaan karne se roka nahin jayega
 Many times banks hide the information of such stressed account to show their profit more
 rigerv bank or bainkon ke enpie aankadon main antar se yah baat saaf ho jaati he
 Banks have to show more honesty in provisioning for their stressed account, because if a stress account does not become NPA, then it comes back as provisioning profit
 project shashaktbainkon ke paas 500 karod rupee se zyada ke stressd acount se nipatane ke liye pehle se ek 'project shashakt' kaa vikalp he
 Under this, they will get help from asset management companies and Alternate Investment Fund (AIF)
 indian bank association ko ek sakriy tareeke se ek jeevant eemasi or eief model taiyaar karan hoga
 Bankers will now have to act as investment bankers to help them find buyers for troubled firms by moving into a role like investment banker
 ve desh-videsh ke pramukh inwestbank se milakar sambhavit kharidaaron se baat kara sakate hai
 This will give a good price to the selling company
 kathor credit akalanbainkon ko kathor credit assesament niyam banane honge taaki kathin paristhitiyon se batch saken
 Many private banks have taken a conscious approach in lending to companies in the troubled sector
 saarvajanik bainkon ko bhi lone ke maamle main apane jokhim model par punarvichaar karnaa hoga
 These are option 1 in front of the Reserve Bank
 rigerv bank supreme court main ek punirvichaar yachika daayar kar saktaa he2
 This may put pressure on banks to fix their balance sheet by adopting higher provisioning requirements
 3
 The debt asset in the power sector can accept the demand for relief
 4
 Can consult the government about new instructions on insolvency matters

 The fluctuations in the market price of onion have little role in onion acreage or seasonal conditions

 shivasena ke man main bijepi ko lekar khatas bhale hi bani ho, lekin satta ko lekar unki ranneeti bilkul alag dikhaai de rahi he

 congress netaa or karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ne bhartiya janata party (BJP) ko lekar vivaadit bayaan diya he
 He has compared BJP to prostitutes
 siddharmaiya ne kaha, 'veshyaayein dance floor ko lekar shikaayat nahin kar saktin
 Those dancers who are unable to dance complain about the dance floor
 isse meraa matlab bijepi se tha, kisi or se nahin
 When former Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was asked that every JDS worker is giving him the reason for this after the coalition government fell
 is par siddharmaiya ne kaha ki jo vaishya dance nahin kar sakati, vahi floor ke bare main shikaayat karti he
 When Siddaramaiah was making this statement, the leader of Karnataka Mahila Congress was also sitting with him
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab siddharmaiya ne aisa koi vivaadit bayaan diya ho, isse pehle bhi kai baar unpar mahilaon kii beijjati or vivaadit bayaan dene ke aarope lagate rahe hai
 a video of Siddaramaiah has also gone viral in the past, in which he is seen abusing a woman and bullying her publicly
 haalanki vivaad badhane par siddharmaiya ne kaha tha ki vah mahila unki bahan jaisi he
 He had no ulterior motives
 iske alaava june 2016 kii ek group photo main girija shrinivas naam kii ek mahila utsaah main aakar siddharmaiya ke gaal chuum leti he, is ghatana kii bhi kaaphi aalochana hui thi
 Girija was a member of Tarikere Taluk Panchayat from Amritapura in Chikkamagaluru district
 ghatana se asahaj najar aae siddharmaiya ne chehre par badi muskaan ke saath gaal poncha tha
 The issue of beef in the country does not seem to stop the controversy
 karnataka ke siem siddaramaiya ne kaha he ki ve ab se bif khaanaa shuru karenge
 Siddaramaiah alleged that an unnecessary issue like Beef is being raised under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi
 unhone media se baat karte hue bif ko lekar bijepi netaaon ke aitraaj par kaha, 'maine ab tak to bif nahin khaaya he, par main ab se bif khaanaa shuru kar duungaa
 what's wrong with that? Who are you to question me on this? ”siddaramaiah said that due to such issues, insecurity has arisen across the country
 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar ko vikaas jaise muddon par dhyaan dena chahie
 The Central Government has filed a counter affidavit in the Supreme Court on the reconsideration petitions filed regarding Rafale Deal

 Three articles printed in the media are the views of the people and not the final decision of the government

 The CAG has examined Rafael's price information and stated that it 2
 86% kam he
 The central government said that whatever the court asks for, the government is ready to submit documents related to Rafale
 rafel (rafale Deal) par punarvichaar yachikaaon main koi aadhaar nahin hai, isliye sari yachikaayen khaarij kii jaani chahie
 Let me tell you that in its December decision, the court said that it is not the job of this court to compare the pricing details in cases like the present
 ab court is maamle main6 may kosunwaayee karegaa
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had ruled that it would rely on confidential documents of the Ministry of Defense printed in The Hindu and hear them on their basis
 bataa den ki ye yachikaayen yashavanth sinha, arun shouri or prashanth bhushan ke alaava manohar laal sharma, vineet dhanda or aap saasand sanjay singh ne daakhil kii he
 a bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice KM Joseph in the Supreme Court rejected the Centre's initial objection that these documents are privileged and the court cannot see them

 According to party president Bhupesh Baghel, Sanjay Singh started his job as a Class Three employee in the tourism department in 1986, but the way he was promoted year after year has raised many questions
 saal 1993 tak wo senior tourist afasar tak hi pahunch paye the jo class tu kii post he
 However, as soon as the partition of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh came and he came to Chhattisgarh, the speed of his progress suddenly increased

 "come get the nine, make your Delhi clean
 
 
 yahi he sach-sach, banaaen svachh-svachh
 
 
 "singer Shivani Kashyap chanted this mission song at a Delhi BJP event
 oktober ke duusare hafte main dilli bijepi ne apane swatchta abhiyaan ke liye navratnon kii ghoshnaa kii thi, nau brands ambaseder
 This mission song was composed with the same nine
 mishan geet kaa mukhdaa shuru hi hota he, aao nau ko laaen, yani navratna kaa har aadmi nau-nau ko jodta chale or is tarah safai abhiyaan janandolan main badal jaae, kyonki 'yah he sach-sach, banaaen svachh-svachh
 
 
 'union Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu was also present at the event
 pradesh bijepi adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ne nau brands ambasedaron ke naam zaahir karte hue apana uddeshy bhi bataaya tha ki ye sabhi nau log alag se nau logon ko brands ambaseder banaaenge
 In this way, the cleanliness campaign in Delhi will spread to the people
 safai abhiyaan ke navratnon ke naam is tarah hai - shazia ilmi, olympic vijeta susheel kumaar, dilli vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati dinesh singh, doctor keke agarwal, katthak ustad uma sharma, dilli vishvavidhyalay chaatr sangh ke adhyaksh mohit nagar, praveen khandelwal, disiem group ke vinay bharat ram or india islamic centre ke adhyaksh sirajuddin kuraishi
 Union Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu was also at the time of the announcement of these Navratnas
 is kaarykram main shazia ilmi ne uchit hi narendra modi kii tarif kii thi or kaha tha ki yah ek mahaan abhiyaan he
 Cleanliness should not be considered just the job of the cleaning staff
 desh ko saaf karne kii zimmedaari hamaari bhi he
 With this picture, the BJP had also cut political twitch to the common man, but after a month, the picture of Shazia and Siraj-ud-din is cutting the BJP
 india islamic centre kaa kaarykram tha to iske adhyaksh ko to bijepi ne hi safai ke navratnon main shaamil kiya tha
 Siraj-ud-din Qureshi is a well-known figure, also an industrialist and has goodwill around the world, but if his program is replacing this campaign close to the Prime Minister's heart, then Satish Upadhyay must take some action
 vah yah kahkar nahin batch sakate ki abhiyaan unka nahin tha
 His brand ambassadors belonged to him as well
 kya vah sirajuddin kuraishi ko navratna samooh se baahar karenge
 Many times the chief guest gets caught on such an occasion
 ham log bhi photo khinchaakar funs jate hai
 But Upadhyaya has made some mistakes
 kya unhen nahin pataa tha ki vah kis kaarykram main mukhya atithi hai
 Did he not know that the Lodhi Road on the India Islamic Center is usually clean
 pedo se pattey-pute girte rahete hai, jo vahiin galkar khaad main badal jate hai
 Removing them and burning them is another crime, which spreads pollution in the air
 pataa karnaa chahie ki un patton ko antim sanskaar ke liye kahaan le jaaya gaya
 If the picture of this program of the India Islamic Center does not get caught in controversies, then this election season would also create a political image for the BJP, which is less than a clean, more than a vote bank
 is chunavi mausam main safai ke liye kuraishi, ilmi or upaadhyaay vahaan okhla bhi ja sakate the, jahaan yamuna kaa kinaaraa ganda he
 As Rajnath Singh went to the banks of the Gomti River and Shashi Tharoor also chose the bank of the river
 aise saaf-suthri jagahon par safai abhiyaan kaa kya matlab he
 From social media to media, pictures of Upadhyay, Ilmi and Qureshi Sahab have gone viral
 har taraf pradhanmantri ke kaarykram kaa mazaaq ud rahaa he
 The BJP should take more concrete action than dismissing the 'chalta hai' type, so that the message goes that it will not be tolerated if the supporters of Narendra Modi will follow the gimmick in following the stated path
 aam aadmi party or congress ne in tasveeron se soshal media ko paat diya he
 If the opponents put this picture on the hoarding and put it in the streets of Delhi, then the party may suffer
 vaise aam log bhi is harakat se kaaphi naaraaz hai

 Chautala, who recently visited a private function in Jalandhar, said that the main objective of his party is to oust the Congress from power in the country and his party (INLD) is working on this agenda

 Speculators estimate that the BJP will get at least 200 seats and the party's PM candidate Narendra Modi will take an unbeatable lead over his main opposition Congress
 agar in satorion kii gananaa par yakeen karen to bijepi congress se kaaphi aage nikal jaaegi or sahyogiyon ke boote centre main sarkaar banane main kaamyaab hogi
 Overall, there is a voice coming from Satta Bazaar that 'modi will be PM this time
 'jahaan tak piem pad ke daavedaaron kii baat he to dilli ke satta bazaar main narendra modi sabase aage chal rahe hai
 Modi's price here is 20 paise, while Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has Rs 10 and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal Rs 50
 yani satorion ke mutabik kejariwal ke piem banane kii sambhaavna sabase kam he
 In Madhya Pradesh's Satta Bazar, Modi's price is 25 paise, Rahul's 75 paise and Kejriwal's Rs 25
 gujarat main modi kaa bhav 30 paise, rahul kaa ek rupee or kejariwal kaa 40 rupee he

 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's chances of becoming Prime Minister are the highest (20 paise)
 iskaa matlab he ki agar modi piem banate hai to ek lakh rupee kaa satta lagane vaale shaks ko ek lakh 20 hajaar milenge

 sabake saath nyaay kii raajnneeti ke bajaae, nafrat kii raajnneeti maujuuda sarkaar kii polisy rahi he
 Therefore, changing this government in the coming election will be in favor of religious minorities

 Pakistani newspaper 'tribune' on its front page has described the action against Indian officer as 'tit for tat' in the scandal

 In his characteristic style like a singer of medium tone, the Prime Minister starts the speech with his trademark 'brothers, sisters' and the closing hand again and again 'vande'

 As an effective campaigner and prolific orator, Modi is known for using sharp sarcasm and theatricality to attack his opponents
 unhone loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ke dauraan congress ke 'chaukeedaar chor he' ke taane ke jawaab main 'main bhi chaukeedaar' abhiyaan shuru kiya or puure chunavi paridrishy ko ek jatke main badal diya
 Compare this with Modi's August 8 address in which he told the country why his government withdrew the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370
 yah ek saamaanya or pratyaksh sandesh tha jo un aam kashmiriyon tak pahunchane ke liye tha, jo pradhanmantri ke shabdon main, ''peedit or sangharshrat hai''
 Modi promised early elections, prosperity of Kashmir and re-statehood in future
 janata ke saath judye kii modi kii kshamta unhen ek aisa taqatvar netaa banaati he jo paristhitiyon ko apane niyantran main rakhata he
 This is echoed by the opinion of every respondent in India Today's mood survey of the country
 35 pratishat ne kaha ki yah loksabhaa chunaav main endie kii jeet kaa sabase bada kaaran tha
 16 per cent felt that the NDA won due to India's air strikes in Balakot, 11 per cent saw it as a fruit of the achievements of the Modi government
 jahaan 7 pratishat ne bhaajapa ke rashtravaadi abhiyaan ko jeet kaa praathmik kaaran mana to anya 7 pratishat ne jeet kaa shrey bhaajapa kii hindutvvaadi raajnneeti ko diya
 Although expressing full support for PM Modi's leadership, his government has failed to meet some public expectations: 35 percent said unemployment has worried them the most; For 16 percent, the farmers' crisis was the most disturbing
 bhrashtachar or mahangaai ko kramash: 11 fisad or 10 fisad vot mili
 Nine percent said that the economic downturn was their major concern and 8 percent said that the huge gap between the income of rich and poor bothers them
 uttardaataaon ne kisaanon ke sankat, berogari or aarthik mandi ke bare main shikaayat to kii lekin unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki akele piem modi in saare muddon ko hal kar sakate hai
 Half of the respondents said that the condition of farmers has improved since the Modi government took power in 2014 — an increase of 30 percentage points since the last country mood survey in January 2019
 64 fisad logon kaa maananaa he ki piem-kisaan yojana kaa laabh sabhi kisaanon tak pahunchane ke faisle se gramin kshetra kaa sankat dur ho jayega
 Why did people facing economic recession and other crises vote in favor of the government even though it is considered a strong anti-incumbency factor? In 2017, Duke University professor Hemant Kakkar's study, published in the prestigious 'proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences' magazine, concluded that "economic hardship creates a sense of powerlessness that leads people to dominate opponents and Attracts autocratic leaders

 When asked about the top three reasons for the opposition's failure in the Lok Sabha elections, 31 percent of the country's mood survey respondents said that the opposition had no face for the post of PM; 21 percent believed that the opposition was divided

 Another 10 percent said that the opposition failed to provide an alternative view to the country for the next five years

 The Prime Minister's approach on issues of national importance has received significant support in the mood survey of the country
 kya 'ek raashtra-ek chunaav' (sansad or vidhansabha chunaavon ko ek saath karana) acha vichaar he? 57 pratishat ne kaha ki haa, isse vakt or dhan kii bachat hogi
 64 percent said it was good for the bjp-led NDA to get an overwhelming majority in the new Lok Sabha as a strong government can take the country in the right direction
 teen talaak ko khatm karke sarkaar mahila shashaktikaran kar rahi he? 66 pratishat uttardaataaon ne kaha ki haa; alpsankhyak samudaay ke 49 pratishat logon ne bhi sahmati jataai
 On the Ram Janmabhoomi issue, 61 per cent opined that the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya should be done at the same disputed site
 65 pratishat ne kaha ki supreme court ke netritv vaali madhyasthata prakriya vivaad ko sulajhane kaa sabase acha tarika tha
 On Kashmir's question, 57 percent said that its special status should end
 65 pratishat se bhi zyada logon kaa maananaa tha ki modi sarkaar ke paas agle paanch varsh main kashmir mudde ko hal karne ke liye jaruri sankhya or ichhashakti, donon hai
 People have faith in Modi
 naukariyon, aay or anya aarthik chunautiyon jaise gambhir sankat main bhi unki asaadhaaran lokapriyata bani hui he
 Perhaps a strong leader and nationalist narrative has become the new poppy for the masses
