 ' soshal netwarking site fasebuk ne search ko or behatar banane ke liye graph search opshan shuru kiya he
 Graph search is at the top of a user's Facebook page as a large search bar
 graph search kii madad se yujar ke liye nae conection, dost or jagah dhundhna aasaan hoga
 However, graph search is currently only for UK users
 fasebuk kaa daawa he ki graph search se aap fasebuk pej or doston ko unke naam se dhund sakate hai
 Or you can use simple sentences to find a particular person, photo, location or something else
 masalan, agar aap apane puraane doston yaa aise logon ko dhund rahe hai jinaki ruchiyan aapse milti hai to aap ise kuch is tarah search kar sakate hai: "my friends who live in my town" yaa "friends of friends who like tennis"
 Not only this, in addition to your favorite photographs, you can also search for such pictures which you have forgotten to see
 iske liye aapako graph search main likhnaa hoga: "photos i have liked," "photos of my family," "photos of my friends taken in Brighton"
 Apart from this, you can also search the places mentioned by other people and restaurants etc
 masalan, "hotels in London visited by my friends", "restaurants in Paris, France, visited by people who live in Paris, France"
 Facebook says that graph search not only helps millions of users to get information, but the experience of this search is completely different for everyone and it changes all the time
 agar aap “photos of my friends in Spain” likhakar chhuttiyaan manaane kaa idia dhund rahe hai to jaise-jaise aapke dost apni trip kii photo share karenge, ye apadet hota jayega
 According to Facebook, through graph search, users can search only those things which are shared with them
 inamen un logon ke post bhi shaamil hai jinhone kisi post ko publikali share kiya he, lekin ve aapaki friend list main nahin hai
 Facebook says that through privacy shortcuts and activity logs, you can decide who you want to show your shared post

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) October 28, 2018 Saif Ali Khan's film bazaar is based on multiplication of the stock market
 critics ne is par mili-juli pratikriya di he
 According to trade pundits, the budget of the film is about 40 crores and it has been released in more than 1500 screens
 duusare din film kii kamai ko dekhakar ye kaha ja saktaa he ki aage ye behatar coleksh karegi
 The story of the film Yeh Hai begins with Mumbai industrialist Shakun Kothari (saif Ali Khan) who considers himself the king of the stock market
 shakun kii bivi mandira kothaari (chitrangada singh) he
 Traders with Shakun are jealous of him because his way of working is different
 isi bich elahabaad shahar se trading karne vaale rigwan ahamed (rohan mehara ) kii entry mumbai main hoti he
 He has only one dream, to meet Shakun Kothari once
 is dauraan rigwan kii mulaakaat priya (radhika apte) se hoti he, jo ki ek trading company main kaam karti he
 Rizwan's meeting with Shakun and the incident of various events before and after meeting is also an interesting incident
 use jab bhi bhukh lagati wo nal kaa pani pi le or raat ke samay jab thand lagati to vahiin pade mats par raat kaat letaa
 When he was found, he had neither tears nor fear
 wo kisi normal bachche kii tarah hi najar aa rahaa tha, haa lekin wo bhookha tha
 We are talking about Yamato Tanuka
 jisaki shaitaniyon se tang aakar uske maa-baap ne use jangal main chhod diya tha
 The parents initially said that their son was missing somewhere, but later admitted their mistake
 yamato ko uske mata-pita ne sajaa dene ke liye jangal main chhod diya tha
 Yamato used to stone the vehicles and people coming and going, causing his parents to leave him in the forest
 yamato, sena ke training base ke paas mila
 This place was a few kilometers from where his parents left him
 puri tarah he surakshitjis vakt yamato sainya adhikariyon kii najar main aayaa, us vakt wo bilkul normal tha
 He asked the officials for something to eat
 adhikariyon ne use khaane kaa saamaan diya or use turant najdiki aspataal le gaye
 Where the doctors said after investigation that the child is completely fine
 use di-hydration kii shikaayat ho gai thi or haath-pair main kuch jagahon par kharonche aa gai thim
 But the most shocking thing is that the child was not nervous at all
 wo bahut shant tha
 Whereas living in a forest alone for six days is not a minor thing
 bachche ke laut aane se puraa japan khush he
 Yamato has become a hero
 log uske manobal, dhiraj or samajhadaari kii misaalen de rahe hai
 Parents may have to suffer
 Such a case of teaching a lesson to the child has come up for the first time
 police kii maane to yamato ke mata-pita ko laaparvaahee ke aaropon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he or iske liye unhen sajaa bhi ho sakati he
 Despite all restrictions in the states adjoining Delhi, the incidents of stubble burning are not taking the name of stopping

 Now the accused who are holding the hostage to the authorities are being identified
 police kaa kahana he ki aropiyon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii jaaegi
 Let me tell you that due to burning of stubble in Punjab and Haryana adjoining Delhi, the pollution situation has become huge
 punjab ke tarantaaran main pradooshan kaa str kaafii zyaada he
 Pollution has increased manifold due to burning of straw

 Here the whole sky is seen black due to the smoke of straw
 gauratlab he ki haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne paraali jalaane kii ghatnaon kii jaankaree dene waalon ko inaam ke rup main nakadi dene kii shuukravaar ko ghoshnaa kii he
 The CM has directed the officials to encourage the farmers to adopt other options

" yah hamaare abhiyojkon kii swatantraaa kii suraksha ke liye or chal rahe sangheey maamalon main khalal paidaa karne se bachane ke liye kiya gaya tha
 '' florce ne is kadam kaa bachaav karte hue ek bayaan main kaha ki jorge dablyoo bush or bill clinton donon hi prashasano ne apane kaarykaal kii shuruuaat main isi tarah ke aagrah kiye the
 Famous as a 'crusader' prosecutor, Bharara met Trump in November after winning the election
 mulaakaat ke baad media reporton main kaha ja rahaa tha ki trump ne bharaara se pad par bane rahane ke liye kaha tha
 New York lawmaker Charles Sachmer said he was upset to learn about the demands of American advocates to resign, especially on the demand for Bharara's resignation
 tippaniyan He said, "the President had called me in November and assured that he wanted Bharara to hold the post of US Attorney from Southern District

 muuli khaane ke bahut se phaaydon ke bare main aapako pataa hoga lekin kya aap jaanate hai piles kii rokthaam ke liye muuli se behatar koi doosraa vikalp nahin he
 Piles problem can be overcome in a few months by regular and proper use of radish
 iskaa sabase bada phayda ye he ki muuli ke niyamit seven se piles kii samasya badhati bhi nahin he
 Piles is a disease in which pain and irritation persists in a particular part of the body at all times
 piles ke marijon ke saath sabase badi samasya ye he ki wo iskaa zikr apano se to kya doctor se bhi karne main kataraate hai
 But this is wrong
 doctor se salaah lekar uskaa sahi ilaaj karana bahut jaruri he
 With home remedies, you can get relief from this problem in a few days
 piles ke marijon ko aksar muuli khaane kii salaah di jaati he
 The biggest reason for this is that dietary fibers are found in radish
 jo stool ko mulaayam karne main madad karte hai
 It also improves digestion
 muuli main kai aise tatv paae jate hai jo is dauraan hone vaale dard ko kam karne main madad karte hai
 Apart from this, radish acts as a coolant
 jisase jalan main bhi raahat milti he
 Piles patients should consume raw radish only
 aap chahen to ise ghiskar kha sakate hai
 Or you can drink it after extracting its juice
 muuli ke ras kaa seven karne se pehle ekbar doctor kii salaah jarur le len
 If you want, you can also use its juice to soothe the irritation of the infected place
 ab to bazaar main muuli kaa powder bhi aasaani ye mil jaataa he
 You can also use its powder if you want
 agar aap bazaar se kuch bhi kharidkar prayog nahin karnaa chaahate hai to muuli kii pattiyon ko chaaya main sukhaakar ghar par hi uskaa churna bana sakate hai
 With regular intake of one month, you will see the difference

 Pollution has increased by 5 to 6 times at night

 Due to which the passengers are facing a lot of trouble
 vahiin 'aaj tak' kii team ne dilli main raat bhar alag-alag ilaakon main jaakar ye janaa ki kaise 3 se 4 ghante main pradooshan 6 guna tak bad jaataa he
 Know what is the situation in Delhi in the morning after the whole night has passed
 dhundh ke chalate kitna pradooshan bad jaataa he ye bhi dekh lijie
 The Meteorological Department says that pollution is less during the day as the air moves during the day, thereby eliminating fog
 magar raat main hawa nahin chalane kii vajah se dhundh zyada hoti he
 Hence pollution is many times more
 pehle aapako samajhaate hai ki piem 2
 What does 5 and PM 10 mean? kitna hona chahie piem 10 or piem 2
 The normal level of 5 PM10 should be 100 micro gram cubic meters (MGCM)
 agar ye level 500 micro gram cubic meter tak pahunch jaataa he to sthiti behad khatarnaak hoti he
 PM 2 right there
 5 kaa saamaanya level 60 mjisiem hota he lekin yah yahaan 300 se 500 tak pahunch jaataa he
 That is, the situation is very dangerous
 subah 4 baje kii baat karen to lodhi road par pradooshan kaa level behad khatarnaak paaya gaya
 PM 2
 5 or piem 10 donon kaa level 500 paaya gaya
 This level was between 200 and 300 a day
 magar raat main 3 se 4 ghante ke bich hi ye achaanak se bad gaya
 At 3 o'clock in the night, fog itself, visibility was extremely low, so was the condition of the railway station
 magar ab aapako bataate hai ki dilli main raat ko kis tarah dhuaan badhata he
 As the night is passing in Delhi, the mist is also increasing
 visibility behad hi kam ho gai he
 Due to which the fear of accidents has also increased
 oonchi-oonchi imaaraten bhi dhundh ke chalate dhank gai hai
 Talking about the radius of 50 meters, nothing is visible after 50 meters
 dhundh ke chalate train 10 ghante letdelli main pradooshan kii dhundh
 
 
 There is smoke everywhere
 mangalvaar ko jaise hi dilli kii subah hui har koi pareshaan rah gaya
 People's eyes started burning
 
 
 logon ko saans lene main dikkat hone lagi
 At the same time, the effect of haze appeared most on the railway
 kareeb 20 trainen deree se chal rahi hai
 When our correspondents reached New Delhi station at around two o'clock in the night, everyone and only the traveler appeared, who was very upset due to his train being late
 logon kaa kahana he ki hamaari din main 1 baje train thi or ab dekhie raat ke do baj gaye hai magar train abhi tak nahin ai he
 Overall, the poison dissolves in the Delhi air itself
 jiske baad pradooshan kaa level khatarnaak sthiti main aa jaataa he
 So that people are having trouble breathing
 vahiin ankhon main jalan kii bhi pareshaani saamne aa rahi he
 Now really the Delhi government needs to take some concrete steps
 jisase ki is pradooshan par niyantran paaya ja sake

 Let us tell you that till this morning, there was talk of forming a government in Maharashtra with Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP
 teenon dal uddhav thakare ko siem banane par sahamat bhi ho gaye the or charchaa thi ki aaj aupchaarik taur par ve rajyapal se milakar daawa pesh karte, lekin isi bich ajit pavaar 'kingmekar' banakar ubhare or rajya kaa siyaasi sameekaran badal gaya
 Ajit Pawar (ajit Pawar) is the son of Sharad Pawar's elder brother Anantrao Pawar
 unka janm 22 july 1959 ko hua tha
 Ajit's father Anantrao is the famous film director V
 shantaram ke saath kaam kar chuke hai or ve chaahate the ki ajit bhi film industry main apana kariyar banaaen, lekin unhone (ajit pavaar ne) apane chachaa sharad pavaar kii raah chuni or unke nakshe-kadam par chalate hue saal 1982 main raajnneeti main pravesh kiya or kooparative sugar factory ke board main chune hue
 He was also the Chairman of Pune District Cooperative Bank
 isi dauraan baraamati se loksabhaa saansad bhi nirvaachit hue, baad main unhone sharad pavaar ke liye yah seat khaali kar di thi
 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Shivanand Tivary has reacted strongly to the announcement of state mourning by CM Nitish Kumar on the death of former Bihar Chief Minister Jagannath Mishra
 unhone apane fasebuk pej par ise lekar ek post likhaa he
 In which he said that on the death of Pandit Jagannath Mishra, Nitish government is celebrating three days of state mourning
 jagannatha ji lalu ji ke saath chaara ghotaale main abhiyukt rahe hai
 Rather, he has been punished in three cases of this scam
 do maamle main paanch-paanch varsh or ek maamle main saadhe teen varsh kii sazaa he
 He further wrote that Nitish ji often says that corruption, crime and communalism are unbearable for me
 lalu ji ke bhrashtachar kii duhai dekar mahagathbandhan se alag hone vaale nitish ji sajayaftaa vyakti ke liye rajkeey shok kii ghoshnaa ke dwaara kya bhrashtachar ko mahima mandit nahin kar rahe hai !gauratlab he ki yah koi pehla mauka nahin he jab shivanand tiwari ne nitish kumaar par nishaanaa saadhaa ho
 Earlier, Shivanand Tivary attacked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 unhone (shivanand Tivary)mangalvaar ko kaha tha ki nitish kumaar ke liye bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaanaa nishtha kaa sawaal nahin he, yah unke liye raajnneetik narebaaji kaa hissaa maatr he
 Shivanand Tivary said that i want to tell you now that Nitish Kumar is going to raise the status of special state status for Bihar
 unke pradesh adhyaksh ke anusaar vidhansabha ke agle chunaav main jad you isko mudda banane ja rahaa he
 After a long time Nitish Kumar has taken special status from his bag
 lekin nitish ji kii raajnneeti kaa yah aazamaaya hua nuskhaa he
 But this is an effective recipe, Nitish ji is not sure on this
 unhone (shivanand Tivary) kaha tha ki nitish ji ke mitra or desh ke vitt mantri arun jetali saaf-saafe kah chuke hai ki ab kisi bhi rajya ko vishesh rajya kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa jayega
 Even the Chairman of the 15th Finance Commission and former JD-U MP Shri N
K
 singh bhi spasht kar chuke hai ki vikaas ke liye kisi rajya ko ab vishesh rajya ke darja kii zarurat nahin he
 He (shivanand Tivary) had said that if Nitish Kumar had been honest about the special status of Bihar, he would have had a golden opportunity for it
 vah mauqaa unako us samay mila tha jab palati markar ve mahagathbandhan se nikle the
 At that time if he had kept the status of special state, the condition of joining hands with Narendra Modi ji, then surely he would have achieved
 lekin palati maarane ke evaz main mukhyamantri kii apni kursi to unako yaad rahi lekin vishesh rajya kaa darja bhul gaye
 We will expose this campaign of Nitish ji among the public
 gauratlab he ki yah koi pehla mauka nahin he jab shivanand tiwari ne nitish kumaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 Earlier, he (shivanand Tivary) had said that Narendra Modi had never stopped Nitish Kumar from coming to Bihar
 aaj piem modi ke sahare janata se vot maang rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar has nothing left to show for his work and to ask for votes
 shivanand tiwari (shivanand Tivary) ne kaha tha ki aaj nitish kumaar ji apni raajnneeti ko bachaane ke liye unheen ke naam kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 It will be a matter of research how Nitish Kumar, once considered the alternative face of Narendra Modi in the country, has become refugee in front of him today! He said that Nitish Kumar has eaten his ego
 vah samay rahete apana akalan tak nahin kar paae
 His spoons have put an end to his thinking
 unhone (shivanand Tivary) kaha ki nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ke patan kii shuruyaat ho gai he
 Where and how it ends will be interesting to see
 shivanand tiwari (shivanand Tivary) ne aage likhaa tha ki un ladakiyon ke saath jo amanviya or croor vyavhaar hota tha vah iske pehle ke sibiai report aa chuki he
 The latest report has now revealed the murder of eleven girls
 in besahaara or bhagyaheen bacchiyon ke saath sarkari anudaan or dekharekh main chalane vaali sanstha main lambey samay se chal rahe is ammanushik krity kii jaankaree sarkaar tak kaise nahin pahunchi
 It has been made public in the past that the director of the Muzaffarpur Girls' Home, Brajesh Thakur is a friend of Nitish Kumar
 mukhyamantri banane ke baad uske bete ke janmdin kaa kek kaatane nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) mujffarpur gaye the
 Who would dare to complain against an organization run by a person who has such a close relationship with the Chief Minister "? Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) National Vice President Shivanand Tivary wrote that if the Supreme Court Had the case not been vigorously monitored, Nitish Kumar would have defended the matter by now
 pehle to jaanch report ke baad police main maamla darj nahin ho rahaa tha
 Even if it is recorded after a lot of hullabaloo, then according to the allegations, there is no time
 balki aisi dfaaon main jinamein aasaani se jamaanat mil sakati thi
 The Supreme Court had rightly said that the Nitish government was giving money to the Muzaffarpur Girl Child so that what was happening there would continue
 lekin nitish kumaar ke paap kaa gadaa ab bhar chukaa he
 The sighs of the dead and living girls of Muzaffarpur Girls' Home will not be empty

 com / nhwp8tbxts Input: ANI har taraf charchaaon kaa maahaul garm tha ki aagaamee bangladesh daure ke liye kai senior khilaadi team india main vaapasi kar sakate hai
 But only Harbhajan Singh could get a ticket to Bangladesh
 philhal yuvaraj singh,jahir khan,virendra sahvaag,gautam gambhir or ashish nehra jaise senior khilaadiyon ko rashtriya team main vaapasi ke liye abhi intjaar hi karnaa padegaa
 But Bhajji's selection is nothing short of good news for seniors
 haalanki mukhya chayankarta sandip patil ne daleel di ki harbhajan ko bangladesh kii batting ko dhyaan main rakhte hue unhen team main waapas bulaayaa gaya he
 But is this reason enough for Harbhajan's return? Harbhajan Singh caught everyone's attention by performing brilliantly in the Indian Premier League (IPL)
 bhajji ne ipel ke is sijan main 14 maichon main 25
 Has taken 16 wickets at an excellent average of 75
 lekin dhyaan rahe ki beete ranjai sijan main harbhajan kaa pradarshan bilkul ausat darje kaa tha
 But this move of the selectors has made it clear that if the senior players perform well in domestic cricket in the coming time, then the doors of the team can also be opened for them
 bisisiai main badlaav seniors ke liye raahat lekar ayabisisiai main kuch bade badlaav ke baad team main bhi badlaav ke sanket mil rahe hai
 The dominance of Srinivasan & Company is now almost seen to be on the board
 jab shrinivasana lobby kaa board main dabadabaa tha us samay seniors ko maano said-line hi kar diya gaya tha
 But with the change in the board, Harbhajan Singh returned to the team
 or is vaapasi ne yah sanket saaf taur par de diya he ki agar senior khilaadi acha pradarshan karte hai to unki bhi team main vaapasi ho sakati he
 The current secretary Anurag Thakur has clearly stated that in the coming time, major changes can be seen in the board as well
 kohli kaa seniors ke saath he behtareen rishtayah baat kisi se chuphi nahin he ki har captain apni pasand ke khilaadi ko team main rakhana chahta he
 When MS Dhoni was the captain of the test team, the doors of Team India were almost closed for seniors
 lekinviraat kohlike captain banate hi bhajji kii team main vaapasi ho gai
 The selectors also recognize that there is a big role of captain in team selection
 viraat ke saath jahir khan, virendra sahvaag, yuvaraj singh or ashish nehra ke kaaphi achche rishte hai
 In such a situation, if these players perform well in domestic and maintain fitness, then they too may return to the team
 aligarh muslim uniwarsity (AMU) ke chaatrasangh ke haul main lagi pakistan ke sansthaapak mohammad ali jinna kii tasviir ko lekar vivaad thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 The new development is that the Jinnah picture has been removed from the hall for the time being
 tark ye diya gaya he ki parisar kii safai chal rahi he, isliye tasveeron ko hataaya gaya he
 Sajjad Subhan Rathar of AMU Students Union says that due to the cleanliness, not only other pictures of Jinnah have also been removed

 Meanwhile, BJP MP from Aligarh Satish Gautam told 'aaj Tak' that the university administration has come into action after my letter to the VC of AMU in this regard
 gautam ke mutabik unhone visi se kaha he ki jinna kii tasviir ko pakistan bhej dena chahie
 Please tell that in a letter sent to VC, Gautam asked what is the compulsion to keep Jinnah in Keatsvir University while Jinnah was the architect of the partition of the country
 gautam ne ummid jataai ki jinna kii tasviir ko uniwarsity se hataa liya jayega
 On Yogi government minister and BJP leader Swami Prasad Maurya's demand for the removal of Jinnah's picture, Gautam said, "this is his personal statement and he has nothing to do with the party
" wo kuch bhi bole unke bayaan par kya karnaa he wo sanghathan dekhegaa
 i am an MP from Aligarh, i have responsibility for Aligarh, i have no responsibility for who is speaking
 gautam se jab bijepi ke rajyasabha saansad harnath singh yadav kii ore seswami prasad mauryake khilaaf karrwai kii maang ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'harnath singh yadav bade netaa hai, main unki tarif karata hum, unka jo bayaan or maang he us par sanghathan vichaar karegaa
 'please tell that Harnath Singh Yadav said that he should apologize for what Swami Prasad Maurya has said in the case of Jinnah's picture
 agar wo aisa nahin karte hai to unhen party se nikaala jaae
 When former Vice President Hamid Ansari, who arrived at Aligarh Muslim University on Wednesday, was questioned on the controversy related to Jinnah's photograph, he said, 'I don't talk about stupid things, let people who are doing politics, do politics, i am ten The year was between the politicians but i never did politics'
 hamid ansaari ko eemyu chaatrasangh kii ore se maanad aaajeevan sadsyta se sammanit kiya ja rahaa he
 Meanwhile, the general secretary of Jamiat Ulema Hind, Mahmood Madni, said on the controversy over Jinnah's picture that it has two aspects
 pehali baat ham tasveeron, potrate, pratimaaon ke khilaaf hai
 Whoever the person is, but his photographs and portraits should not be captured
 madani ke mutabik jahaan takajinna kii tasvirka sawaal he to bhartiya muslim unhen, unke vichaaron or bharat ke bantwaare ko pehle hi khaarij kar chuke hai, isiilie unhone pakistan jane kii jagah bharat main hi rahanaa chunaa
 Madani said that he believes that such things should not be kept in institutions associated with Muslims
 madani ne saath hi sawaal kiya ki is tasviir ko itane samay tak vahaan rakhaa kyon gaya
 Madani also said that no outsider should be allowed to interfere, the university administration should remove the portrait of Jinnah itself

 pakistan kii sattadhari pakistan pipuls party (pipipi) ke ek netaa ne cricketer se rajaneta bane imran khan par 2002 main hue janamat sangrah ke dauraan purv sainya shaasha general parvej musharraf se chaar karod rupee lene kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Significantly, this referendum had legitimized Musharraf's rule
 pipipi ke varisht netaa or pakistan ke punjab praant kii gathbandhan sarkaar main mantri raja riyaj ne kaha ‘‘taanaashaahee shashan kaayam rakhane ke prayaason main ahm bhoomika ke liye khan ne general musharraf se chaar karod rupee liye
 Riyaz also alleged that Khan, the chief of Pakistan's tehreek-e-insaf party, had hired his relatives on the Pakistan Cricket Board during the Musharraf regime
 unhone kaha ‘‘khan kii ore se samarthan die jane ke kaaran musharraf ne unka ehsaan chukaaya
 Riyaz alleged that Khan, who talks about jhumriyat all the time, is actually plotting against it
 baharhaal, khan kii party ne riyaj ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kaha he ki is tarah kaa aarope lagane vaale mantri ko vah adaalat tak ghasitegi
 Here for some time, Imran Khan has been critical of the PPP chief and President Asif Ali Zardari and the ppp-led government at the center
 khan ne haal main kaha tha ki ‘rashtriya melmilaap adhyadesh’ (enarao) ko radd kiye jane sambandhi supreme court ke faisle ko lagu karaane ke liye pakistani sena kii madad leni chahie
 Under this ordinance, Zardari and 8,000 others, who were caught in criminal cases, were granted clemency
 khan madhyavadhi chunaavon kii bhi vakaalat karte rahe hai kyonki unka maananaa he ki desh ko sankat se nikaalane ke liye unki party hi ekmaatr vikalp he
 The general elections held in February 2008 were boycotted by Khan's party

 Nitish Kumar's coronation in Bihar is one of the few political events that brought the hearts of the majority of people to heart in the coming year
 sadiyon se jati-paant ke daldal main dhanse bihar ne is baar us dal ko apana samarthan diya, jisase vikaas kii aas lagaai ja sake
 In fact, Bihar, which has lagged behind other states in the race for development, has seen only a 'trailer' of development in the last five years
 'trailor' pasand aayaa, to janata ab 'puri film' dekhnaa chaahati he
 Now it is the moral and legal responsibility of the Nitish government to embody public sentiments
 aise main sawaal yah uthta he ki bihar ko aakhir kya chahie or kya sabase pehle chahie
 In an online voting on this issue, the public has expressed their opinion
 sawaal poocha gaya tha ki bihar kii nitish sarkaar ko kis mudde par sabase zyada dhyaan dena chahie? vikalp rakhe gaye the- 'udyog', 'shiksha', 'bijli' or 'rojgaar'
 Out of nearly a thousand people, the highest 38 per cent chose employment as a priority, while 27 per cent approved the industry
 shiksha ko praathamikta bataane vaale logon kaa pratishat 22
 6, while the percentage of those who chose 'electricity' as the first requirement was 12
 4 rahaa
 Actually development is a consolidated process
 kai ayaamon ko milakar yah purnataa kaa rup leti he
 The living of a common man is carried out by employment, so it is very natural to come in first place
 jinhone udyog ke vikaas kii sabase zyada jarurat bataai, ve bhi kahin na kahin ise rojgaar paidaa karne vaali mashin ke taur par dekh rahe honge
 Once upon a time, Jawaharlal Nehru described the factories as 'temples of modern India'
 vikaas ke raste par sarapat daudane ke liye bihar ko sachmuch aise 'mandiron' kii jarurat he
 Slipping to the third position of education not only creates some anxiety, but also leaves some indication for the backwardness of the state in this matter
 yah kuch-kuch vaisaa hi he, jaise koi apni santan ko skool bhejne kii bajaae use khet par yaa kisi kaam par laga detaa he, taaki vah kuch paise kama sake
 In the absence of education, neither the golden picture of employment will be made, nor the total benefit of the industry can reach the common man
 rahi baat bijli kii, jo baaki vikalpon main pratishat ke lihaaj se chauthe paaydaan par rahaa
 In the absence of electricity, it cannot be imagined to set up industries and spin the wheel of progress
 iske abhaav main paidaa hue andhere ne hi shaayad ab tak pradesh main itani andhergardi machaai he
 Well, now Bihar needs electricity, so that the light of development can spread
 bihar va uttar pradesh ko centre kii raajnneeti kii dhuree maanane waalon ke liye bhi yah vakt khush hone kaa he
 Perhaps 'development' and 'vote' should become synonymous with each other in the coming days
 uttarakhand main prakritik aapadaa ke baad se sarkaron ne kedarnath dham main vyavastha ko durust banaae rakhane ko lekar apana dhyaan shuru se hi kendrit rakhaa he

 tirthayatriyon ke liye kedarnath ke kapaat 29 april se khulenge
 With the change of time, the government of Narendra Modi in Delhi and Trivendra Singh Rawat in Uttarakhand also started working here, giving priority to Kedarnath
 khud modi ne sarvapratham kedarnath ke vikaas ke liye kadam aage badhaayaa
 This is the reason that while the PMO is busy in completing this work, on the other hand, Uttarakhand government has also started redesigning Kedarpuri one day and night
 kedarnath ke honge ab sidhe darshanapradhanmantri modi ke dream projectake tahat kedarnath kaa swaroop purnatah badal gaya he
 These days work is going on loudly in Kedarnath
 kedarnath mandir se aadha kimi dur tak paidal maarg ko purna rup se 50 feet chaudaa kiya gaya he
 All buildings and shops that fall within the pedestrian radius have been demolished
 ab aadha kimi dur se hi baba kaa mandir dikhaai de rahaa he
 Locally ready stones are being planted on this walkway
 iske alaava kedarnath mandir ke aage evam peeche ke pasir ko bhi kaaphi chaudaa kiya gaya he
 The temple is seen in changed form due to increasing width
 chaude parisar main ruk sakate hai ab hazaron yatrimandir ke parisar kii chaudaai badhane se hajaaron yatri mandir parisar main hi thahar sakate hai
 The widening of the Kedarnath walking route is included in the Prime Minister's Dream Project
 pradhanmantri ke nirdeshon ke baad hi paidal maarg kaa chaudeekaran hua he
 The main objective of widening of the walkway is to make the pilgrims visit the temple from a distance, so that the pilgrims see the temple from a distance and they do not feel tired
 vaise to pradhanmantri modi ke dream projects ko puraa karne ke liye khud mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat lagaataar nazar banaae hue hai
 But the PMO is also being monitored directly so that any deficiency in the work can be given instructions immediately

 The main symptoms of this viral are mild fever, sore throat, colds and sores start coming
 haathon kii hatheliyon, paanvon ke talave par laal raishesh dikhne lagate hai
 Red rash and blisters are present inside and outside the mouth
 lekin acchhee baat ye he ki is viral se philhal koi khatra nahin he
 According to doctors, the virus that spreads it is quite mild
 lekin jo bachche iskaa shikaar ho chuke hai unke saath puri saavdhaanee baratani chahie kyonki ye virus kaaphi sankramit he or ek bachche se duusare main teji se fail rahaa he
 According to Dr
 Vandana, its victims should not be sent to school at all as well as kept separate at home

 kejariwal par lagaataar aarope lag rahe hai
 From money rigging to hawala and money laundering
 lekin 'ajtak' ke camere par kuch aise khulaase hue jo saaf-saaf saboot hai ki AAP kii sarkaar kii naak ke neeche kejariwal ke rishtedaaron kii samaanaantar satta chal rahi he
 How are Kejriwal's relatives threatening the officers and getting them to do what they want to do, and how they are made to work if they do not work
 sawaal bada ye he ki kya kejariwal ke raaj main niyam-kaayade kii nahin dhamkee kii bhashaa chalati he
 The open game of nepotism is going on in the rule of Kejriwal who claims to have changed the power and the system? Kejriwal's relatives-on the strength of the power system, make the government machinery fingertips
 'ajtak' ke camere par ye khulaasa saboot he ki kaise dilli main sarkari afasaron kii bahen marodakar manamaane tareeke se kaam karaayaa ja rahaa he
 Actually Assistant Engineer Dinesh Sharma is a victim of nepotism in Kejriwal government
 kejariwal ke saadhu surendra bansal kii company renu construction kii raah main roda atakane kii badi keemat inhen chukaani padi
 Because he was transferred in one stroke due to water logging on the planning of Kejriwal's relative
 udhar, assistant ejeeniyar dinesh sharma beti se milane america gaye or idhar unke naam transfar kaa khat aa gaya
 Dinesh Sharma said, 'around the end of April or 1-2 of May, my file went to the secretariat for transfer, i asked what is my fault? Because i had taken NOC, my daughter lives in the US and i went to meet her on 6 May
 inhone is bich 10 may ko transfar kar diya, jabaki 22 tak meri chuttee thi'
 Now it is also necessary to know what was the fault of this engineer, what was the crime? According to Dinesh Sharma, the mistake was that he did not allow Kejriwal's sister-in-law's company to break the drain, because Kejriwal's sister-in-law's company Wanting to break the sewer and carry the goods which was illegal
 dinesh sharma kaa kahana he ki unhone spasht kah diya tha ki jo kaam hoga wo thik se hoga or niyam se hoga
 For this reason, he was transferred
 dinesh sharma kii maane tokejariwal ke sadhu surendra bansal ke bete vinay kumaar ne inhen phone par dhamkiyaan di
 Kejriwal was in awe of being CM, and was even warned to lose his life
 dinesh sharma ne 'ajtak' ke camere par kai hairaan karne vaale khulaase kiye
 Renu Construction is surprised at the price at which the contract for the work is done and they look black in pulses
 ye ek ejeeniyar ke tabadale kaa maamla nahin, kejariwal sarkaar kii soch or sanskaar kaa sawaal he
 The big question is, are not the common people under Kejriwal's rule - relatives are flourishing and their own hank in the corridors of power? @azmishabana@senaparna Here's to women power coming in a big way,cheers!https: / / t

 talaak ke zyaadaatar maamalon main aapane suna hoga ki pati ko bacchon ke paalan-poshan ke liye patni ko kharchaa dena padataa he
 But here the matter is exactly the opposite
 pati-patni ke bich ek vivaad main rohtak court ne ahm faisla sunaaya he
 Under this decision, the wife will spend two and a half thousand rupees every month for the upbringing of her own daughter
 is maamle main pati ditisi kaa barkhaast driver he jabaki patni dilli police main consteble ke pad par tainaat he
 The divorce and harassment case has been going on in the court for a long time between the two
 bacchee apane pita ke saath rahati he
 Kartar Singh of Naunand village in Rohtak was married on 18 February 2007 to Mukesh Kumari of Lakhu Buana in Panipat
 20 disambar 2007 ko unki beti khushi kaa janm hua
 In 2008, Kartar Singh joined DTC as a driver, while in 2009, Mukesh Kumari was recruited to the Delhi Police as a constable and went to Delhi for training
 iske baad kartaar singh or mukesh kumari ke bich vivaad rahane lag gaya or 18 sitambar 2010 ko mukesh kumari ne panipat ke israna thane main kartaar singh ke khilaaf dahej utpeedan or marpet kaa cese darj karvaa diya
 Mukesh Kumari did not return to her in-laws and the girl started living with her father
 is dauraan mukesh kumari ne kabhi bhi bacchee ko apane saath le jane kii koshish nahin kii
 Due to the case, Kartar Singh was suspended from his job and then terminated
 mukesh ne panipat court main hi talaak kaa cese bhi kar diya
 On the other hand, Kartar Singh filed a petition in Rohtak Court to settle his house and also demanded the expenses for the upbringing of the daughter
 kartaar singh kii ore se rohtak court main tark diya gaya ki mukesh kumari kaa masik vetan 35 hajaar rupe prati maah he, jabaki uski naukari chhot chuki he
 In such a situation, he is not capable of raising his daughter and the responsibility of his upbringing is with the father as well as the mother
 isliye bacchee ko paalane ke liye har maah kharchaa dilvaaya jaae
 On the other hand, Mukesh Kumari's lawyer argued in the court that Kartar not only owns the property, but is also running a dairy
 saath hi ditisi main naukari bhi karata rahaa he
 But the court did not accept the argument of Mukesh Kumari's lawyer and after hearing both the parties ordered Mukesh Kumari to pay the husband's upbringing expenses to the husband at the rate of two and a half thousand rupees per month
 kartaar singh kaa kahana he ki vah apni beti kii dekhbhaal khud hi karata he
 Her sister used to help, now her mother is helping to raise a daughter
 kartaar singh kii vakil ravita kaa kahana he ki court ne abhi antarim raahat di he
 The final decision will be made during the next date in July

 My brother and i would schlep the water from the well to the house, and then we would all clean ourselves - first my mother, then my father, then my brother, then me
 The water was a little dirty by the time it was our turn but my brother and i weren't going to schlep back to the well

 The court sent Chidambaram to CBI remand till August 26, during the hearing, Sibal had demanded the remand
 Presented in a court
 sunwaayee ke dauraan chidambaram kii ore se pesh hue varisht adhivaktaa kapil sibbal ne unke bachaav main kai tark or daleelein pesh kin lekin wo naakaam rahe
 The court in its judgment has sent Chidambaram on CBI remand till August 26
 vakil rojaanaa kareeb 30 minute unase mil sakenge
 The family will also be able to meet only 30 minutes daily while in custody
 bataa den ki sibiai ne chidambaram se poochtacha kar 'badi sajeesh' kaa khulaasa karne ke liye unki 5 dinon kii hiraasat kii maangi kii thi
 Sibal gave these arguments during the hearing of the case earlier
 Kapil Sibal said that the first arrest in the case was of Bhaskar Raman, a chartered accountant of Karti, son of former Union Minister, who is currently out of jail on bail
 sibbal ne kaha ki uske alaava maamle ke anya aaropee peter mukherjee or indrani mukherjee ko bhi jamaanat mil chuki he lekin anya maamle main ve jail main hai
 Sibal said that grant of bail is a rule and the issue before the court is of personal liberty
 poochtacha ke liye chidambaram ko 5 dinon kii hiraasat main saunpe jane kii sibiai ke maang kaa virodh karte hue unhone yah daleel di
 In fact, the investigating agency had requested the court that Chidambaram get 5 days custody of the CBI, citing the need to reveal the larger conspiracy
 solicytor general tushaar mehta ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki is ghotaale main chidambaram duusare logon ke saath aapraadhik sajeesh rachane main shaamil the
 He was arrested after a non-bailable warrant was issued against Chidambaram
 mehta ne adaalat se kaha, 'chidambaram jaanch main sahyog nahin kar rahe
 He is evasive in his reply
 ' mehta ne kaha ki yah dhan shodhan (mani laundring) kaa ek gambhir or bada maamla he
 He said that Chidambaram needs to be detained and interrogated in order to highlight the benefit of anything
 unka dastavejon se amana-saamana karaaye jane kii jarurat he
 Strongly opposing the cbi's arguments in the court, Sibal argued that what the agency has said cannot be taken as 'irrefutable truth'
 sibbal ne kaha ki chidambaram se 12 sawaal puche gaye or vah unamem se 6 kaa jawaab pehle hi de chuke hai
 Sibal said, "investigators don't know what to ask and they don't even have questions ready
" buudhvaar raat giraftaar ke baad chidambaram se poochtacha guuruuvaar kii subah 11 baje kii gai
 They were not even allowed to sleep at night
 ' court main bahes ke dauraan chidambaram ne kaha ki vah pichley 24 ghanton se nahin soe hai
 Sibal said that not confessing crime does not mean that Chidambaram is not cooperating
 aise main jaruri nahin ki chidambaram har baat main haa bolen
 If Chidambaram was non-cooperation then why did these things not go before the High Court
 jab bhi sibiai or idi ne chidambaram ko bulaayaa wo hajir hue
 Mehta also referred to the decision of the Delhi High Court, which rejected Chidambaram's anticipatory bail plea
 unhone kaha ki is maamle main ab tak aaropapatr daakhil nahin kiya gaya he or yah aaropapatr daakhil karne se pehle kaa charan he
 He said, 'therefore, we need the material that Chidambaram has
 ' unhone daleel di, 'hiraasat main poochtacha kiye jane par prabhavi jaanch ho paanaa sambhav hoga
 ' ek mahila karmchaaree ne beete dinon air india ke GM par yon shoshan ke gambhir aarope lagaae the
 The victim had also written letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Minister of Civil Aviation Suresh Prabhu and Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha in this regard
 haalanki suresh prabhu ke alaava anya kisi ne peedita kii chitthee par koi jawaab nahin bheja
 At the same time, Suresh Prabhu's instruction was so moving that Air India did not take any concrete action against the accused GM
 ab peedita kii taraf se air india ke purv karmchaariyon ke ek group ne suresh prabhu or mahila evam bal kalyaan mantri menka gandhi ko phir se shikayati chitthee likhi he
 In this letter of former employees, it has been said that a separate committee has not been formed to investigate the matter, due to which the airline management is again pressing on the whole matter
 itnaa hi nahin chitthee main airlines kii internal complaint kamity kii adhyaksh aruna gopalkrishnan par bhi aaropee GM kaa hi paksh lene kaa aarope bhi lagaaya gaya he
 Not only this, according to the victim, the airlines management made statements contrary to Suresh Prabhu

 It has been reported that ICC chairperson Aruna Gopalakrishnan has been entrusted with the charge of these flight service departments till now, hiding the misdeeds of GM Captain Daryl Pace, accused of sexual exploitation
 shikayatakarta kaa kahana he ki vastav main yah ek chhadam prashasan he jo media main isse sambandhit khabaren dhimi padane ke baad aaropee adhikari kaa hi paksh legi, balki unheen ke nirdesh par kaam karne lagegi
 Despite the investigation, the accused GM remains on the post, it is clear from the letter of the complainant that despite accusing and sexually harassing several female employees, the accused officer has not been removed from his post, which is a violation of Visakha guidelines
 
 shikayatakarta mahila ne isisi ko apni pehali shikaayat pichley saal 27 agast ko di thi
 At that time ICC CMD was Lohani
 haalanki shikaayat risive karne ke mahaj kuch ghanton ke andar lohani kaa transfar kar diya gaya or lohadi ke jane ke baad kisi ne us complaint par dhyaan hi nahin diya
 Meanwhile, Chairman of the Internal Complaint Committee, Aruna Gopalakrishnan tried to circumvent the complaint by saying, "so what does this, Captain Daryl flirt with me too
" 'aaropee adhikari ke paas hai itane adhikarshikayatakarta ne is patr main vistaar se bataaya he ki aaropee adhikari air india kettghn captain darryl pesakhir airlines kii dheron mahila karmchaariyon ke yon shoshan kaa itnaa gambhir aparaadh karne ke baavjood kaise bachate chale aa rahe hai
 It has been told in the letter that in fact Captain Daryl Pace has so many administrative rights that no one can dare to stand against him
 captain darryl pes ke adheen kareeb 300 karmchaaree hai, jinamein se 75 fisadi mahilaayein hai
 The accused officers are also the Discipline Authority and the Appeal Authority in all types of internal investigation cases

 He approves tenders for these flight services, which also cover entertainment, uniforms and hotel expenses

 or har baar aaropee adhikari apni pasandida yuva mahila karmchaariyon kaa hi chayan karte hai
 The use of obscene language openly in the office along with the letter also gives some examples of obscene language used by the accused officer for female employees in the office, which is extremely objectionable
 aaropee adhikari dwaara kahi gai ashleel baaten saaf-saaf is ore ishaara karti hai ki offis main sirf unhi karmchaariyon ko labhanvit kiya jaataa he, jo unhencexual fevardetii hai
 According to the complainant, the accused officers openly make comments in front of all other employees about a female employee's private parts, their sex activities and sex interests

 BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha has once again praised Congress President Rahul Gandhi for adopting the rebel attitude
 unhone sansad main avishvaas prastaav ke dauraan rahul gandhi ke bhaashan ko umdaa bataaya
 Along with this, he named Rahul Gandhi as a qualified candidate of the Congress for the post of PM in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 shatrughna sinha ne kaha, rahul gandhi kaa avishvaas prastaav par bhaashan umdaa tha
 Even before that when he became Congress President, he gave a very good speech, but the speech of no confidence motion was very good
 shatrughna sinha yaheen nahin ruke, unhone piem modi ko gale lagane ke bartaav kii bhi tarif kii
 He touched PM Modi, he touched the heart, he said, the way Rahul Gandhi hugged PM Modi touched his heart
 kuch log piem modi ko gale lagane par aapatti kar rahe hai lekin jab hamaare piem videshon main duusare rashtradhyaksh ko gale lagaate hai to wo sahi hota he
 i think Rahul Gandhi has started a new tradition by embracing PM Modi
 shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki hamaare piem ne america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ko baraak tak kah diya tha
 Therefore, Rahul Gandhi has not done anything wrong by embracing PM Modi
 aankh maarane kii ghatana pehle kishatrughna sinha ne sadan main rahul gandhi ke aankh maarane par kaha, rahul ne apane bhaashan ke turant aankh nahin maari thi, mujhe lagata he ki ye takanic kaa jamaana he
 i think maybe the eyewitness incident is earlier
 unhone aage kaha ki rahul gandhi ke bhaashan se bukamp bhale naa aayaa ho lekin puure sadan main bhuuchaal jarur aa gaya tha
 Rahul Gandhi's speech on the motion of no confidence was ripe
 ban sakate hai party kaa cheharashathru ne kaha ki agar congress ne tay kiya he ki wo party ke pradhanmantri pad ke chehre honge to isamen kuch galat nahin he
 No qualification is required to become a PM
 sab kaam karte-karte sikh jate hai
 Shatrughan Sinha said that i voted in favor of the party but Rahul Gandhi has won the heart

 bijepi se baghawat kar congress kaa daaman thaamne vaale shatrughna sinha bihar ke patna sahib seat se maidan main hai or unki patni punam sinha samaajawaadee party se lakhanu ke ranbhumi main utari hai
 Shatrughan has party religion on one side and wife religion on the other
 aise main wo party se zyada patni dharm ko ahmiyat dete najar aa rahe hai
 This is the reason that first did a road show in Lucknow in Poonam Sinha's nomination and now they have come to ask for votes for wife against Congress and in favor of SP
 lakhanu loksabhaa seat par rajnath ke khilaaf sapa ne haal hi main bijepi chhodkar congress main shaamil hue shatrughna sinha kii patni punam sinha maidan main hai or congress se acharya pramod krishnam chunaav lard rahe hai

 i see him not only as the future of Uttar Pradesh but sometimes as the future of the country and as a contender for the post of Prime Minister
 jabaki congress kii or se party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa daavedaar bataaya ja rahaa he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah are constantly questioning and mixing with the leaders of the opposition

 Whether it is rainy drops or fire, the rising sun, the umbrella protects you by making you feel your need in both the seasons
 fishan kaa paryaay ban chuki rangabirangi chhatariyaan aaj se hi nahin balki sadiyon se alag-alag rup main apane astitv kaa ahsaas karaati rahi hai
 If you want to get out of the house in the rainy season, hands first look for the umbrella
 agar chhatari ghar par bhul gaye or raste main pani baras padaa to munh se yahi nikalataa he ‘kaash, chhatari na bhuule hote
 Arpita Singh, a student of Ramjas College, says that in summer, an umbrella is useful to protect from the sun
 lekin barish main chhatari laga kar chalane kaa majaa hi kuch or hota he
 Last year, my umbrella was lost during the rainy season
 maine duusari chhatari kharidi kyonki iske bina barsaat or garmi main kaam chalane vaala nahin he
 'in a government office, clerk Kanta Dubey says,' i have kept an umbrella in my drawer in the office
 barish main ghar se nikalate samay to chhatari le sakate hai lekin agar bhul gaye to offis se lautate samay mushkil ho jaati he
 My house is far from the bus stand anyway
 ’ chhatari kab se astitv main ai yah kahana mushkil he
 But in ancient history, there is a mention of Raja Maharajas walking behind their servants with an umbrella
 aitihaasik tasveeron main bhi maharaajaaon ke sar par chhatari lekar chalate anuchar najar aate hai
 It can be said that at some time the umbrella was also a symbol of royal honor
 alag-alag deshon main jarurat ke anusaar, chhatariyaan alag-alag rup dhar kar logon ke kaam aati raheen
 The image of the umbrella is clearly visible in ancient artifacts from India as well as Egypt, Greece and China
 chhatari ke mahatv ko dekhte hue kuch deshon ne ek din iske naam kar diya he
 In these countries, "umbrella Day" is celebrated on 10 February
 sarojini nagar ilaake main chaate kii ek dukaan ke sanchaalak girdharilal gupta kehete hai ‘pehle kaale chaate aate the jo bade hote the or unhen fold nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 For the elderly, these umbrellas also provided support like a stick
 ab folding chaate aate hai
 They can be easily folded and placed in the bag
 ’vah bataate hai ‘chaaton kii keemat unki quality ke anuroop hoti he
 Now people who drive two-wheelers in the rain prefer rainwear ie rain coat
 rain kot pahan kar dupahiyaa vaahan chalaanaa aasaan hota he jabaki chaate ko sambhalate hue dupahiyaa vaahan nahin chalaaya ja saktaa
 Arpita says that the umbrella in strong wind also reverses
 vah kahati hai ‘‘folding chhatariyaan najuk hoti hai
 They reverse in strong wind
 ’chhatari aam aadmi kii jindagi kaa ek hissaa to he hi, filmon main bhi isane apni jagah banaai he
 In the film "chalbaaz", Sridevi and Sunny Deol can be seen carrying a transparent umbrella and peering over the song "na jane kahan se se ai hai"
 vahiin ‘koi mil gaya’ main priti jinta or rithik roshan chhatari lekar ‘idhar gaya
 
 ’ geet par barish main jhuumate dikhaai dete hai
 If it is a matter of the Scindia family of Gwalior, the meaning of the umbrella changes
 sindhiya rajmahal main ek hisse main samadhi sthal he jahaan chhatriyon ke neeche sindhiya rajvansh ke divangat sadasyon kii samadhiyaan hai
 It is not sensible to investigate policy matters related to energy after one year
 yah koi aisa vishay nahin he jiskaa alpavadhi nazariye se moolyankan kiya ja sake
 It takes a long time to change the stance and that too is filled with many uncertainties
 is salaah ke baavjood main thik yahi karne kii koshish kar rahaa hum or pichley ek saal main urja kshetra main narendra modi prashasan ke pradarshan par ek nigaah daalane ja rahaa hum
 a year ago, at the request of this publication, i drafted the expectations of the energy sector for the new government
 sujhaavon kii us potli main jeevashm eendhan, akshay urja, niyaman, sabsidi, keemat nirdhaaran kar-nirdhaaran or kanoon, saare masale shaamil the
 The most important of my suggestions were: The Prime Minister should pass an 'energy security and accountability law' so that the policy can be the basis for looking at energy from a divided perspective of seven different ministries in a holistic and unified view
 
 unke prashasan ko jeevashm eendhanon ke utpaadan main teji laane ke liye pranali main jami baithi baadhaon ko hataanaa chahie or ek pratispardhi tathaa bazaar-sanyojit keemat or kar-nirdhaaran dhaancha taiyaar karnaa chahie
 And finally, they should take the economy on a path of low-carbon emissions growth
 ek saal baad, main modi sarkaar ke kadamon se utsahit hum
 There has been no talk about that multi-purpose energy law but steps have been taken towards formulating an integrated energy policy
 inase arthvyavastha ko svachh or kam carbon-saghan aarthik vikaas ke raste par le jaaya ja sakegaa
 The government has also revived the coal industry
 phisaddhi to keval petroleum kshetra rahaa he
 This slowness in his growth is astonishing because the blueprint for increasing oil and gas production is well defined
 ek 'urja suraksha or javabdehi bill' laane kii pradhanmantri modi ko meri sifarish is tathy par aadhaarit thi ki urja suraksha tathaa urja nirantarata kaaphi mahatvapurn masale hai lekin ekikrut urja niti taiyaar karne kii disha main koi sansthagat tantra maujuud nahin he
 Seven ministries deal with supply-related issues
 maang se jude masalon (sangrakshan or urja kushalta) ko inhen mantralayon ke kai vibhaag dekhte hai to sanchaalan tathaa vitaran dhaanche (jaise railway, bandargah, pipeline, vitaran va aapurti) ko kai nikaay dekhte hai jo yaa to swytt hai yaa phir rajya or centre sarkaron kii kai sansthaaon ke adheen faile hue hai
 To fill this institutional void, i suggested a bill on energy
 ise hameshaa ek atirikt sifarish ke rup main hi dekha janaa tha, lihaaja koi hairat kii baat nahin ki pradhanmantri ne is par koi karrwai nahin kii
 But they have taken steps in the decision-making process to break many layers that have been frozen
 unhone urja, nai or akshay urja tathaa koyala mantralayon ko ek hi mantri ko saunp diya he, or haal hi main samanvay badhaane tathaa manjuuri main teji laane ke liye sachivon ke str par ek antar-mantralay forum taiyaar kiya he
 Petroleum is still a separate ministry and the files in it still travel in a vertical structure but now it has become easier to consider energy policy in a holistic scope
 svachh urja par patibaddhtadusari sakaaratmak baat yah he ki svachh urja, khaas taur par saura or pawan urja par dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 Cess on coal production to finance Clean Energy Fund is Rs 50
 prati ton se badhaakar 100 ru
 Has been per tonne
 yah fund kuch samay pehle svachh urja praudyogiki main shodh or vikaas ko madad dene ke liye sthapit kiya gaya tha
 For now, it remains to be seen whether the funds being raised in this way are used effectively
 lekin isse kam carbon utsarjan karne vaali takneekon ko viksit karne or use vyavasayik banane kii disha main sarkaar ke iraadon kaa sanket to miltaa hi he
 Further, the government has set ambitious targets for solar and wind energy
 uskaa iraadaa he ki agle ek dashak main desh main saura urja kii kshamta ko maujuuda 2
 Increase power generation capacity from 5 MW to 100 GW and increase the capacity of wind power from 25 GW to 50 GW
 pehali najar main yah lakshya naammumkin-sa he
 The first thing is that it requires a lot of miraculous improvement in the previous performance
 abhi tak akshay urja kii kshamta main salanaa vruddhi kii ausat dar 1-1
 It has been 5 GW
 ab sarkaar ko apana lakshya hasil karne ke liye har saal saura urja kii kshamta main 19 gigawatt or pawan urja kii kshamta main 6 gigawatt kaa ijapha karnaa hoga
 In the context of land acquisition and project approval, this in itself is a major challenge in terms of project management
 duusari baat ki grid sambandhi samasyaayein bhi khadi hongi
 The current structure of the grid is not able to withstand the wide flow of individual and random electrons
 use unnat karne kii jarurat hogi or isaki laagat 100 arab dollar se zyada hi baithegi
 Despite this, i am happy that the government has played such an ambitious scheme at the grassroots level
 isse svachh urja kii disha main majboot patibaddhta kaa sanket miltaa he or gaiyr-jeevashm eendhan aadhaarit urja vyavastha kii ore badaae kii ichha dikhaai detii he
 It will take many years to move towards such a system
 lihaaja alp-madhyavadhi main hamaari praathamikta tel, gas or koyale ke aayaat par nirbharta kam karne kii honi chahie
 The government's record in this direction is mixed
 usne koyale main to bhale hi nai jaan phoonk di he lekin tel or gas ke maamle main rattibar ruchi nahin dikhaai he
 There is a positive improvement in the pace of coal sector
 kul 31 koyala block ke liye boli kii prakriya safaltaapurvak puri ho gai he
 Even though many people argue that the rates of sales are not based on fair value and that many companies that get mining licenses will live up to their commitments, it is certain that this sector is on the path of high growth
 Has gone is vittiya varsh kii pehali timahi main utpaadan vruddhi pichley saal kii isi avadhi kii tulana main dohare ankon main rahi
 However, much more remains to be done to use the domestic reserve fund fully and sustainably
 khaas taur par sarkaar ko ek taraf koyala utpaadan teen guna karne kii apni patibaddhta or duusari taraf vaayu pradooshan ko niyantrit karne kii dodhari talwaar par chalanaa hoga
 Pollution has reached an extremely deadly level and our 13 cities are ranked among the most polluted cities in the world
 koyala utpaadan ke bhautik lakshyon kii purti karne ke saath-saath svachh koyale or uske utsarjan ko niyantrit karne kii patibaddhta bhi jaahir kerani hogi
 And the dust is blowing, Kelkar reports
 The picture of the petroleum area is somewhat blurred
 pradarshan ke maanakon ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to isamen sudhaar behad kam hi hua he
 Oil and gas production has not increased
 yahaan prati hajaar varg kilometre par 20 kuon kii khoj kii gahanta, duniya main sabase kam he
 The New Discovery Licensing Policy (NELP 10) has not yet seen a ray of light
 companiyaan ab bhi naukarshahi ke haathon ho rahi deree or adangebaaji kii shikaayat karti hai
 There has also been very little investment in improving the distribution and supply structure
 sirf ek ullekhneey safalataa najar ai he or vah bhi nichle kshetra main
 The government has made good use of the fall in international oil prices to cut subsidies and deregulate prices of transport fuels (diesel and petrol)
 yah puri tarah se saaf nahin he ki petroleum kshetra main itani susti kyon he
 There was no systemic bottleneck and the government had a blue print as to the Vijay Kelkar Committee report on what needs to be done to accelerate exploration and production
 sambhavatya yah hai profile companiyon se jude muddon se paar paane main naukarshahi kii hichak rahi
 Perhaps Gal's price politics was behind this
 yaa phir shaayad yah mahaj aadhikarik hath tha
 Whatever be the reason, the fact is that after extensive consultation with international and domestic experts, the report of the Kelkar Committee, which gave several practical recommendations, was put on hold and neither to increase the rate of recovery in the existing oil fields and Nor was any initiative taken to speed up the search for new oil fields
 nateeja yah rahaa ki pichley salbhar main tel or gas ke utpaadan main kisi bhi tarah ke sudhaar kaa sanket nahin dikhaai diya
 To conclude, let me look at the next year
 yah dekhte hue ki petroleum aarthik vikaas kaa ek mahatvapurn kaarak he, meraa suzav he ki sarkaar kelkar samiti kii report par se dhul jhaade or uski sabase mahatvapurn siforeeshon main se kuch ko amal main laae (mujhe yahaan is baat kaa ullekh karnaa chahie ki main us samiti kaa sadsy tha)-nai khoj licencing chakra (enielpi 10) kii ghoshnaa laagat vasuuli utpaadan bhagidaari model ke aadhaar par kii jaae, na ki boli yogya rajasav-bhagidaari model ke aadhaar par kyonki isse to niveshkon kii ruchi hi khatm ho jaaegi

 ayodhya golicond par mulaayam singh yadav ne ek baar phir vivaadit bayaan de diya he
 Mulayam Singh has said that if more people had to be killed for the unity of the country, then they would not back down
 ayodhya par diya vivaadit bayanmulaayam singh ne apane janmdin ke maukey par kaha ki saal 1990 main apane mukhyamantritv kaal main desh kii ekta ke liye karsevakon par goliyaan chalavaain, usamen 28 log maare gaye
 If we did not save the mosque, many Muslim youth of that era had taken up arms
 mulaayam ne kaha ki iske baavjood agle chunaav main party ko 105 siten milin or sarkaar banaai, jabaki pichley vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ko mahaj 47 siten milin, jo shame kii baat he
 Hathiyarmulayam Singh Yadav said in the hand of a Muslim young man that 20 people died and 80 were injured when bullets fired in Ayodhya
 adwani ne kaha 56 mare
 We said that if Atal ji gives the list, we will apologize by holding our feet

 Blessings to the son, but Khinchai Bhimulayam Singh openly blessed his son and former UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on his birthday and said that Akhilesh is my son first, then the leader

 In the presence of former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, while strongly exhorting the party leaders, Mulayam said that SP still enjoys the support of Muslims as much as it was before
 musalamaanon ne sapa kaa saath nahin choda he, balki party ke netaa unka vot nahin dalava sake
 Of all the Muslims who have voted in the elections, 90 percent have given to the SP
 party ko di naseehatpichley vidhansabha main samaajawaadee party kii karaari haar par mulaayam singh ne kaha ki aapako thodaa kaam or mehnat karne kii jarurat he
 The Muslim society has voted the most Samajwadi Party
 mulaayam singh ne party ko ye naseehat diya

 musalamaanon ke saath hone ke baavjood samaajawaadee party unase vot nahin dalava pai
 Therefore, the party needs to work even harder

 Usually, Muslims sympathize with SP, but how will you fix the current situation, how will booths be run, this is possible only by giving them help in their trouble

 In fact, Lal Krishna Advani and Nitish Kumar met for the first time after JDU parted ways with the NDA, and the shocking fact was that Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi did not attend this meeting

 It was also a photo monmet for journalists

 At the same time, due to the absence of Narendra Modi in the meeting, the political meaning of this meeting is also being extracted
 aapako bataa den ki nitish kumaar ko modi ke prakhar virdohi ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 JDU had decided to separate from NDA because of Modi, as the party said that they did not accept Modi as PM candidate
 vahiin, modi se adwani kii naaraazgi to jagajaahir he

 Salempur Lok Sabha seat is one of the 80 parliamentary seats in Uttar Pradesh and has a parliamentary seat number of 71
 yah sansadeey seat pradesh ke 2 jilon baliya or devaria se milakar bana he
 Salempur is known as the oldest tehsil headquarters of the state

 The Chhotki Gandak river passes near Salempur and is also a major station of the Northeast Railway (NER)
 aazaadee se pehle tak salempur sabase badi tehsil hua karti thi, lekin samay-samay par barhaj, rudrapur or bhatpaar rani ko alag-alag karte hue nae tehsil bana die gaye
 The history of Salempur is also very old
 yah kshetra muslim akramanakariyon ke aane se pehle gupt vansh or paal shaskaon ke adheen rahaa tha
 Due to dense forests, Muslim invaders could not come to invade this area
 raajnneetik prishthbhumisalempur sansadeey kshetra ke antargat 5 vidhansabha kshetra bhatpaar rani, salempur (anusuchit jati), belthra road (anusuchit jati), sikandarpur or banshadih aate hai, jisamen 2 vidhansabha kshetra anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit he

 uske ummidavaar ashutosh upaadhyaay ne 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke jayant kushvaha ko 11,097 maton ke antar se haraaya tha
 Salempur constituency is a reserve seat and from here Kali Prasad of Bharatiya Janata Party defeated Vijay Laxmi Gautam of 2 Samajwadi Party by a margin of 26,654 votes in an easy contest
 belthra road se bhartiya janata party ke dhananjay kannaujia ne samaajawaadee party ke gorakh paswan par 18,319 maton ke antar se jeet hasil kii thi
 This seat is also reserved for Scheduled Castes
 2012 ke chunaav main gorakh vijayi rahe the
 In the 2017 election, Banshadih assembly constituency was won by Samajwadi Party candidate Ramgovind Chaudhary, defeating Independent candidate Ketki Singh by a margin of 1,687 votes in the nearest contest
 saamaajik taana-banaarthik rup se salempur sansadeey seat rajya ke pichde kshetron main aata he
 According to the 2011 census, Salempur tehsil has a population of about 6 lakhs (6,04,483) of which 3 lakhs are males (49%) and 3
 1 lakh (51%) mahilaayein hai

 unhone basapa ke ravi shankar pappu ko 2,32,342 maton (27

 But it is waiting for its first victory after winning here after the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984, then BJP won from here for the first time in the 2014 general election
 1989 or 1991 main janata dal ke harikeval prasad vijayi rahe the
 So SP and BSP have also won here 2-2 times
 harikeval yahaan se 4 baar saansad rahe hai
 Ravindra Kushwaha, a 56-year-old MP from Salempur, has completed his education up to 12th standard

 He is a member of the Standing Committee of the Food, Consumer and Public Distribution Committee
 jahaan tak loksabhaa main satr ke dauraan unki upasthiti kaa sawaal he to unki upasthiti gujarey saadhe 4 saal ke bulaae gaye satron (8 janvari, 2019) main unki upasthiti kaa record 89 fisadi he
 During this 6 times, his attendance was 100 per cent, while his attendance in 6 other seasons was above 90 per cent
 upasthiti ke maamle main unka sabase kharaab pradarshan 2018 ke bajet satr main rahaa jahaan unki upasthiti 66 fisadi rahi
 However, his activism in the Lok Sabha has not been special
 unhone kul 19 bahes main hissaa liya, jabaki bahes main shaamil hone ke maamle main unke rajya kaa ausat 107
 2 percent and the national average of 65
 3 he
 Even in terms of asking questions, it is far behind the national (285) and state (193) average
 unhone 86 sawaal puche hai
 In a way, the Samajwadi Party has dominated the Salempur Lok Sabha seat in the last 30 years
 bijepi to pichhali baar modi lahar main yah seat nikaalane main kaamyaab rahi he
 This time the SP-BSP are contesting the elections together in the state
 aise main badale sameekaran main bijepi ke liye yah seat nikaal paanaa aasaan nahin dikh rahaa
 However, on the basis of the last election, the winning candidate of BJP got around 46 percent votes while the BSP got 18
 7 or sapa ko 19
 68 percent votes were received
 donon ke yoga (38
 38 per cent) is also much less than the vote of the BJP candidate
 agar pichhali surat bani rahi to bijepi kii raah aasaan ho sakati he
 It remains to be seen which party dominates the 2019 elections in Salempur

 " Due to dampness and moisture during the rainy season, the chances of the jewelry turning black or shining are very high
 gahanon ke rakrakhaav main laaparvaahee kii vajah se aisa hota he
 If you want to protect jewelery properly during monsoon, then follow 5 tips below
 1
 First of all it is necessary to know what kind of jewelery is spoiled in the rain
 sone yaa platinum ke aabhushanon ko zyada dekhbhaal kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 But silver jewelery is easily affected
 isliye is mausam main chaandi ke gahanon kii zyada care kerani padati he
 2
 gahanon ko sambhalakar rakhte vakt aamtaur par log inhen kapade main lapetakar rakhte hai, jisase inkaa rang kaala padane lagata he
 For this, use a jewelery box and keep a silica packet in it
 silica packet nami ko sokh letaa he or aapke aabhushanon ko kharaab nahin hone detaa
 3
 yadi aap jewelery box yaa silica packet jaisi chizon kaa bandobast nahin kar paa rahe hai to isaki jagah aap kisi sooti kapade kaa bhi istemaal kar sakate hai
 Cotton cloth is also very effective in absorbing moisture
 4
 When the jewelry turns black, clean them with warm water and wipe them with clean cotton
 iske baad inhen khuli hawa main thodi der ke liye sookhne den
 Later keep all the different types of jewelry in a separate box
 5
 During monsoon, try not to get your jewelery soaked in rain
 yadi aisa ho jaataa he to ghar jaakar unhen garm pani se dhoen or saaf kapade se ponchkar hi jewelery box main rakhen

 During this time, the Gujarat government spokesperson also presented documents related to the facts
 unhone kaha, ‘kejariwal ne kaha tha ki gujarat main saath hajaar laghu or manzole udyog band ho chuke hai

 The truth is that in the last ten years, only one farmer committed suicide due to crop failure
 ’pravaktaa ne aage kaha, ‘kejariwal kehete hai ki modi ke satta main aane ke baad kisaanon se unki jameen chin lee jaaegi
 Their land will be given to big industrialists

 bijepi satta ko bachaane kii jaddojahad main lagi he to congress usee ke tiron se use gherkar rajya main apana banavaas khatm karne main
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has placed bets on three young faces to win the political battle of Gujarat
 inamen sabase pehle alpesh thakor congress ke kheme main aae hai
 Alpesh comes from the OBC community and is young and has been very active on community issues but electoral mathematics is different
 jis alpesh par rahul gandhi ne sabase pehle daanv lagaaya he ve ek samay jila panchayat kaa chunaav bhi nahin jeet sake the
 In such a situation, the question arises, will the Congress be able to break its 22-year exile of power? Alpesh's return to the Congress Alpesh Thakor, who is recognized as an OBC face in Gujarat, joined the Congress on Monday
 rahul gandhi kii maujuudagi main alpesh congress main shaamil hue
 He is back in the Congress again
 isse pehle alpesh 2009 se 2012 tak congress main rah chuke hai
 Alpesh was defeated in the district panchayat election
 Alpesh Thakor returned to become a Taranhar for the Congress in the Gujarat assembly elections 2017, but he could not win from Mandal seat in the 2012 district panchayat election
 alpesh ne us samay bhicongress ke ummidavaar ke taur par kismatajamai thi
 Not only this, 3 years ago, he was campaigning by throwing the Congress
 alpesh thakor ke pita khodaaji thakor congress ke ahmedabad ke gramin jila adhyaksh rahe hai
 The growth of Alpesh in five years, let us know that in the last five years, the atmosphere of Gujarat has changed a lot
 alpesh thakor kaa pichley paanch saalon main groph kaaphi badha he
 Alpesh set the path for a social movement to increase his political graph
 unhone rajya ke obisi samudaay ke 146 jatiyon ko ekajute karne kaa bidaa uthaaya or avaidh sharaab ke khilaaf muhim chhedi
 Alpesh got the support of these castes only through a campaign launched against his intoxication
 kaha jaataa he ki alpesh congress ke saath aane ke pehle bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha khol chuke the
 At a rally last year, he announced that the next Chief Minister would be ours and not bjp's
 alpesh ke pita bijepi main bhi rah chukbalpesh kii raajnneetik prishthbhumi ke bare main baat kii jaae to unkepita khodaaji thakor congresse hai
 Earlier, he was associated with BJP with Shankar Singh Vaghela, but later after Vaghela joined the Congress, he too joined the Congress
 ab ve congress main hai
 Originally a resident of Andala village in Ahmedabad, Alpesh does business of farming and real estate in addition to social service, his village is just a few kilometers from Hardik Patel's Chandan Nagari
 paanch saal pehle alpesh tab surkiyon main aae the jab unhone gujarat kshatriya-thakor sena kaa gathan kiya tha
 This organization works in Gujarat for drug addiction
 aaj bhi is sanghathan main 6
 5 lakh people are registered
 haal hi main alpesh ne ekta manch kii sthapana kii
 Under which he associated people from OBC, SC, ST community
 maaloom ho ki gujarat main 22 se 24 pratishat thakor samudaay ke log hai
 It will be seen how Alpesh proves to be with the Congress and in the electoral battle

 sarkaar main mantriyon kaa kaam he nitigat faisle lenaa or afasaron kaa kaam he un faislon ko lagu karnaa
 But can officers be so heartless that they do not even listen to the cabinet minister of the central government
 baat sunne main ajeeb si lagati he lekin upabhokta maamalon ke mantri ramvilas paswan ne saarvajanik taur par naukarshahi ke saamne khud ko majaboor mana

 Be it the case of writing expiry dates on food items, charging more than MRP, misleading advertisements or charging service charges in restaurants, there was a lot of discussion about consumer decisions Ram Vilas Paswan's many decisions but more in reality The change did not happen
 is bare main poochne par paswan ne sirf itnaa hi kaha ki wo itane sakht kadam bhi nahin uthaanaa chaahate ki log kehane lagen ki police raaj ho gaya he

 The controversy over the suicide of former army soldier Ramkishan Grewal over the demand for One Rank One Pension was not yet stopped that retired personnel of paramilitary forces sat on a dharna at Jantar Mantar in Delhi over their demands
 jantar mantar par hi purv sainik kareeb 500 dinon se dharna prardashan kar rahe hai
 There are 12 lakh personnel in the paramilitary forces and 8 lakh in the service, who complain that they do not play duty and responsibility less than army personnel, but when it comes to facilities and salaries, they are pushed back

 inaki ye bhi shikaayat he sarhad se lekar aatankwaadiyon se ladate hue jab ye marate hai to shahid kaa darja tak naseeb nahin hota he
 Together, the family receives almost half the financial assistance compared to the army

 For this, Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay as well as women leaders of the party Shikha Rai, Rekha Gupta, Kamaljit Sehrawat have written a letter to LG
 is patr main alji se apil kii gai he ki wo turantadilli mahila ayogki adhyaksh se istipha maange, kyonki maliwal ne mahila ayog ke niyam kanoon ko todaa he or wo lagaataar aisa karti rahi hai

 AAP ke vidhayakon ke saath narmidilli police ne is maamle menswati maliwalke khilaaf exiaar bhi darj kii he

 bijepi ne alji se maang kii he ki wo swati maliwal se istipha len or agar wo istipha nahin detii hai, to unhen barkhaast karen
 The Supreme Court on Thursday while hearing a petition seeking to declare the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara (management) Act 2014 invalid, ordered that the status quo would remain intact
 yah aadesh agali sunwaayee tak ke liye he
 The next hearing is scheduled on August 25
 court ne saath hi kaha ki haryana main philhal shiromani gurudwara prabandhak samiti (esajipisi), amritsar or haryana shiromani gurudwara prabandhak samiti (echesgipisi) donon hi apane-apane chadhaave kaa puraa hisaab-kitaab alag rakhengi
 This petition claimed that it was an infringement of the constitution and interference in the religious affairs of the Sikhs
 varisht vakil harish salve ne court ko bataaya tha ki esajipisi, echesgipisi donon hi paksh haryana main gurudware par niyantran karne kii koshish kar rahe hai, jisase sthiti gambhir ho gai he
 Urging the court to hear it soon after he said this, Salve said that the problem is serious, otherwise he would not plead for an early hearing
 salve ne kaha tha ki haryana ne vidhaan banaaya he ki rajya ke sabhi gurudware par haryana sikh gurudwara prabandhak samiti kaa niyantran ho jayega
 He said that SGPC Amritsar is an interstate body, which controls the historic gurdwara
 court ko kaha gaya tha ki haryana bina centre sarkaar kii anumati ke kanoon paarit nahin kar saktaa
 Because Salve repeatedly referred to the seriousness of the ground situation, Chief Justice Lodha said, "whatever they are, they (the state government) should not let law and order deteriorate
" vidhi vyavastha banaae rakhana rajya sarkaar kii sanvaidhanik javabdehi hoti he
 'SGPC member from Kurukshetra who filed the petition, Harbhajan Singh said that the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara (management) Act 2014 is not only hastily brought, but it is also against the constitutional provisions and the Punjab Reorganization Act 1966
 gauratlab he ki haryana main navgathit echesgmasi or amritsar sthit esajipisi ke bich chal rahe gatirodh ne buudhvaar ko kurukshetra main us vakt hinsak rup le liya jab echesgmasi ke sadasyon ne ek gurudware par jabaran niyantran sthapit karne kii koshish kii thi
 During this period, several policemen were injured in violent clashes
 police adhikari ne bataaya tha ki is jhadap main kam se kam paanch pulicekarmi ghayal ho gaye or aadhe ghante ke baad sthiti ko niyantran main laayaa ja sakaa tha, echesgmasi ne kaha he ki hinsa main uske 65 sadasyon ko chot ai he jinamein paanch kii haalat gambhir he
 HSGPC President Jagdish Singh Jhinda said the police used force, injuring 65 people associated with the newly formed management committee
 unhone kaha ki kareeb 30 logon ko kurukshetra ke ek aspataal le jaaya gaya

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) September 24, 2018 Earned on tremendous buzz, the earnings of dullmanmargages may seem weak, but there was a lot of buzz about the film
 samikshakon ne kahani main nae tarah ke prem trikon or sanvaadon ko tavajjo bhi di
 The work of artists Abhishek Bachchan, Taapsee Pannu and Vicky Kaushal was praised
 vicky kaa luk bhi charchaa main rahaa
 The film is also Abhishek's Bollywood comeback
 kareeb do saal baad manmarjiyaan se unhone bade parde par vaapasi kii
 His last film in 2016 was "housefull 3"
 manmarjiyaan ke kuch seens par kaaphi vivaad hue
 Sikh organizations objected to the cigarette smoking scene and accused it of hurting religious sentiments
 baad main nirmaataaon ne film se teen alag-alag seen hataa bhi die
 What is the story of the film? The story of the film is from Amritsar (punjab), where there is a deep love affair between Vicky (vicky Kaushal) and Rumi (taapsee Pannu)
 vicky hameshaa ghar ke chajje se kudakar rumi se milane aata he or is baat kaa pataa puure mohalle ko he
 When Rumi's family comes to know about this, they bet that Vicky has to marry Rumi, then she will have to come home and ask for his hand
 kahani main twist tab aata he jab rumi kii shaadi enarai robi (abhishek bachchan) se tay ho jaati he, is baat kaa pataa chalane par vicky baukhala jaataa he
 The story takes many turns and eventually goes through a lot of situations, leading to it
 neerav modi kii bebaaki par mat chaunkiye ki unhone do took lahaze main pienbi ko paisa lautaane se manaa kar diya
 Or his lawyer gave an example of 2G and CWG, saying that the investigating agencies will not be able to do anything about Nirav
 kahaan se ai he itani himmatjaahir he bharat kii jaanch agenciyon kaa ricard buree tarah kharaab he
 There is another reason for this courage
 neerav modi ne se jis taiyaari or dakshata ke saath pienbi main 11000 karod rupee kii lut ko anjaam diya, vah is baat kaa pramaan he ki use yah sab (chaape-vivaad-interpol) hone kaa anumaan tha
 Nirav, who has taken non-resident Indian status, escaped from the country very easily with his maternal uncle Mehul Choksi
 hairat nahin ki jaldi hi hamen yah pataa chale ki uske paas kisi duusare desh kii naagarikta thi
 Why is it the most amazing bank scam till date? Both Nirav and Mehul, the prime accused in the PNB scam, used a lot of short term inter bank credit (buyers credit-lou) available with the bank for jewelery and jewelery business during 2017
 yah suvidha ayaatkon or khaastaur par james or jewelri companiyon ko antarrashtriya stadar par sugam sanchalanon ke liye milti he
 Read this: Why is India involved in the bank of China that does OBOR funding? According to CBI charge sheet, PNB credit of Rs 5,000 crore from the same branch of PNB in mumbai within 69 days (9 February to 2 May 2017) Companies of Nirav and Mehul were released
 bank niyamon ke mutabik kisi company ko is avadhi main videshi mudra main itnaa bada credit dena puri tarah aswabhaavik he
 In one day, several lous were issued for the same bank branch of the same country
 yah kam samay se adhik se adhik nikasi kii sochi samajhi ranneeti thi neerav or mehul ne is kaam main bharat ke sarkari bainkon kii videshi shakhaon ko hi chunaa kyon ki nijee yaa videshi bank shaayad aisa nahin hone dete
 Why can't this scam happen before 2017? According to the rule of the Reserve Bank of India, if a bank does not get the loan back on the loan for 60 to 90 days from the last date, then the bank's NPA i
