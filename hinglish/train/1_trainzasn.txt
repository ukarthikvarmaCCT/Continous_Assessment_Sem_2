 report ke mutabik is maamle main sarkari paksh adaalat main sabooton ko sabit karne main naakaam rahaa, vahiin kuch gavaah bhi palat gaye

" siaraar main katautee kaa asar graahakon ko bhi byaaj dar main raahat milegi or repo dar main katautee ke mukaable iskaa maudrik len-dein par zyada asar hoga
 Yes Bank Managing Director Rana Kapoor said, "I see little scope for a cut in repo rates as inflation is at the top in the eyes of the RBI
" central bank or union bank ke adhyaksh emvi tanksaale or di sarkaar ne haalanki, kaha ki arabiai siaraar main katautee kar sakati he taaki pranali main zyada dhan laayaa ja sake or nakadi kii sthiti behatar kii ja sake
 The comments arabiai ne maudrik niti kii pichhali samiksha main kaha tha ki maudrik niti main or kisi tarah kii gatividhi sarkaar kii rajkoshiya punargathan kii pahal par nirbhar karegi
 Although four months of the current financial year have been completed, the government has not yet announced the roadmap to curb the subsidy bill
 idhar, bainkon ne kaha ki unhen siaraar main aadha fisadi kami kii ummid he jo philhal 4
 75 percent

 bhartiya state bank ke adhyaksh prateep choudhary ne kaha, hamen siaraar main aadha fisad kami kii ummid he taaki dhanapurti badhaai ja sake
 The impact of reduction in CRR will also give relief to the interest rate and it will have more impact on monetary transactions than the reduction in repo rate
 yas bank ke prabandh nideshak rana kapur ne kaha, mujhe repo daron main katautee kii gunjaaish kam najar aati he kyonki mudrasphiti arabiai kii najar main sheersh par he
 MV Tanksale and d Sarkar, president of Central Bank and Union Bank, however, said that the RBI may cut the CRR to bring more money into the system and improve liquidity
 tippaniyan In the previous review of monetary policy, RBI had said that any further activity in monetary policy will depend on the government's fiscal restructuring initiative
 haalanki, chaalu vitt varsh ke chaar maheene puure ho chuke hai lekin sarkaar ne ab tak sabsidi bill par lagaam lagane kii yojana ke khaake kii ghoshnaa nahin kii he

 More than 100 children have died due to acute encephalitis in Muzaffarpur district of Bihar
 2014 main bhi 139 bacchon kii maut ho gai thi
 In 2012, 178 children died
 koi aisa saal nahin guzarataa he jab yahaan april se lekar june ke bich bacchon kii maut kii khabaren nahin aati hai
 To be emotional, the media must have been emotional in 2012, it must have been in 2014 and it is happening in 2019 as well
 mujffarpur zile main maut se jude jo kaaran saamne aa rahe hai wo ek aisa vishay he agar 100 bacchon kii maut na ho to aapkaa yahi media us par tees second kii bhi khabar na dikhaae
 Not only the media, you also would not like to see
 zaahir he aap bhi raat ke 9 baje kuposhan par charchaa nahin dekhnaa chahenge kyonki aap to maanate hai ki wo dikhaaya jaae jisase lage ki kuch ho rahaa he
 Malnutrition and so on goes on and on
 aap bhi yaad kiijie ki kuposhan or garibi ko lekar kab aapane news channel main abhiyaan time charchaa dekhi thi
 If someone does, would you like to see, if someone debates with the question of whether vaccination is going well to prevent such and such a disease, will you see it
 shaayad bahut se darshak channel badal lenge
 Most of the people from Facebook to the channels are upset about why no one is saying anything
 ham bhavuk logon kii bheed talash rahe hai
 When that crowd does not get formed, the excitement starts to calm down, then we start trying last
 albalane lagate hai
 They start calling each other with names
 mukhyamantri kahaan hai, pradhanmantri kahaan hai
 Where is the government cricket match dekhne vaale ko kosne lagate hai
 The truth is that no one matters
 ham sabane is tarah kii alablaahat kai baar dekh lee he
 The problem is there only
 system vaisaa kaa vaisaa he
 Half-unfinished
 ab darshakon kaa samaaj is str par aa gaya he vah kisi bhi mudde par dibet chahta he
 This has become his last wish
 dibet karaiye
 Debate just like buffalo or sheep fight in the fair
 yah sari baaten apni aalochana main bhi kah rahaa hum
 Overall, in emotional reporting you become painfully aware of the pain, but you forget it immediately
 tabhi to aap bhul gaye ki 2014 main 139 bacchon kii maut hui thi
 Then you do not remember that Dr
 harshavardhan to is aspataal main 2014 main bhi gaye the, 2019 main bhi gaye
 In 2014 from 20 to 22 June, Drs
 harshavardhan mujffarpur main hi rahe the
 In 2014 about this tour, Dr
 harshavardhan ne fasebuk par vistaar se likhaa he jo abhi bhi maujuud he
 a few days later, he was removed from the post of Health Minister and replaced JP Nadda
 sawaal yah poocha janaa chahie ki in paanch saalon main centre sarkaar ke swasthya mantralay ne muzaffarpur ko lekar kya kiya
 Why not implement the announcements that were made after meetings of several levels
 2014 main harshavardhan ne kaha tha ki 100 fisadi tikaakaran hona chahie
 No child should be immunized
 jaldi hi yahaan 100 bistaron vaala bacchon kaa aspataal banaaya jayega
 Five years later, when the same Harshvardhan has again become the health minister, he is repeating the same
 100 karod kaa 100 bistaron vaala bacchon kaa aspataal banegaa
 At that time, Dr
 harshavardhan ne elaan kiya tha ki gaya, bhagalpur, betia, pavapuri or nalanda main virologic dianogsitak lab banaaya jayega
 Two high level research centers will be built at Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga
 yahi nahin medical kalege kii seat 150 se badhaakar 250 kar di jaaegi
 Remember, in June 2014, 139 children died
 paanch saal baad dow
 Harshvardhan is saying all this, Lab will be built, hospital will be built
 paanch saal pehle in tamaam baithkon ke faisle par amal hua hota to 100 bacchon kii maut nahin hoti
 2014 has to be said in 2019 also
 centre kaa swasthya mantralay se poocha janaa chahie ki 2014 main swasthya mantri ne jo elaan kiya tha us par kya kadam uthaae gaye
 Why no steps were taken
 agar isamen centre ke mantri kaa role nahin he to phir ve daura karne ke baad ghoshnaa kyon karte hai
 Does he not appear in the media? phir iskaa jawaab koun degaa ki paanch saal main bihar main wirolagical lab kyon nahin bane
 Why a 100-bed hospital was not built in Muzaffarpur
 centre bhul gaya to rajya sarkaar kya kar rahi thi
 Between 2015 and 17, deaths continued in this district even though the number was less than 50
 bihar ke swasthya mantri kya kar rahe the
 What was the Chief Minister of Bihar doing
 ek maheene se vahaan nahin gaye lekin patna main hi rahete hue muzaffarpur ke garib bacchon ke liye kya kiya
 What did the people of Muzaffarpur do for themselves? kabhi kisi se poocha
 The Bihar government can tell what it did when it got three years after the death of 139 children in 2014
 bihar sarkaar ne 100 bacchon kii maut ko rokane ke liye kya kiya
 Dr
 Harshvardhan is talking about building five virus detection centers in Bihar
 sabase pehle da harshavardhan yahi bataa den ki kend sarkaar kii jo aisi sansthaaen hai unamem kitne staff hai
 An organization like the National Center for Disease Control has adequate staff
 hamane isaki website check kii
 There are a total of 9 branches from Delhi to other cities in India
 in sabhi branchon main branchon main milakar vaigyanikon or har str ke adhikariyon karmchaariyon kii kul sankhya 434 hi he
 India has a population of over one billion
 kitni mahamariyaan failati hai
 According to how low this number is
 iskaa bajet bhi maatr 233 karod he
 All this information is taken from NCDC website
 ab aaiye mahamariyon se ladane vaali duniya kii sabase pratishthit badi sanstha sidisi kii baat karte hai
 CDC means Center for Digital Control
 america ke atlanta main hai
 Hearing its budget, you will faint
 is akeli sanstha kaa bajet 2018 ke liye 11
 1 billion US dollars
 bhartiya rupayon main 77,000 karod
 The budget of a center is more than the health budget of India
 bharat kaa swasthya bajet 52 hazaar karod he
 Now you will understand that in the name of fighting pandemics, we can only spray lime and alum, this is enough
 bharat kii sanstha neshnal centre for dijiz control main 500 karmchaaree bhi kaam nahin karte honge lekin atlanta ke sidisi main 10 hazaar se adhik log kaam karte hai
 2 percent of whom work in different countries of the world
 baaki america main kaam karte hai
 More than five thousand people working at CDC have masters and doctor degrees
 isliye kaha ki hindi patrakarita ko ab bhavukta kii nautanki se bachanaa chahie
 Must come to reality
 ham mahamari se ladane ke naam par media main hedline ke liye ladate hai
 The minister visited
 ghoshnaa ho gai
 Lace cut
 akhbaar ke panne bhar gaye or janata murkh ban gai
 i have not shied away from the death of 100 children in Muzaffarpur
 aapako lag saktaa he ki yah sab kya boring baaten bataa rahaa hum
 Bani and Vrinda have worked hard to gather this information
 susheel bahuguna ne research get naam kii website par jaakar dekha to is maamle main kaarnon or upayon par kai research paper likhe gaye hai jinhen antarashtriya manchon par pesh kiya gaya he
 You can also go to the research gate and read the research paper related to this epidemic
 bharat ke hi doctoron ne simit sansadhano ke baad bhi acha kaam kiya he
 Everything is told, but if the system had implemented it, 100 children would not have lost their lives
 kya badi mehnat se kii gai aisi research ke nattejey sirf filon main dabaakar rakhane ke liye hai
 Researchers can only do research
 us par amal karne kii zimmedaari swasthya mahakme kii he chaahe wo centre sarkaar kaa ho yaa phir rajya sarkaar kaa
 In fact, most of our bureaucracy has no idea of the cost of the work of our scientists and researchers
 wo unki sifaarishon ko saamaanya baat maanakar unhen padhanaa yaa samajhnaa bhi zaruri nahin maanate
 Then how Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi tweeted that there is no cure for this disease
 unhone twit kar diya ki america ke paas bhi ilaaj nahin he
 Prevention means prevention is also considered, who will explain this
 ye kaam karne se behatar he ki aap din ke kai ghante watsape main bitaayen
 Will not even know that you are not knowing anything
 aapako ek or baat bataanaa chahta hum
 When the epidemics spread, there is a position at the CDC in Atlanta to find out the cause, gather evidence, research, and suggest measures to prevent it
 epidemic intelligence afisar kaa
 When our friend doctor told this, it was noticed that we should see what we are doing for such epidemics in India
 baharhaal dow harshavardhan apane mantralay kii in sansthaon kaa haal pataa kar len or apni taraf se hi media ko twit kar bataa den, kitna bajet he, kitna staff he or kya haal he
 The minister should tell himself because such boring topics are not reported in the media, especially in the news channels
 tabhi hoti he jab 100 bachche mar jate hai
 Muzaffpur has 50 bedded icus in Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital where more than 100 children have died
 paanch saal main is aspataal kii kshamta itani hi badi he
 Do not get emotional looking at these pictures
 yahi haal zyaadaatar sarkari aspataalon kaa he
 If Delhi's Twitter class sees their children sitting on the ground, then India will start shaming them
 hindi kaa class chup-chaap mar jaataa he or bharat par marane ke baad bhi garv karata he
 This is the difference
 alam yah he ki bihar ke up mukhyamantri susheel modi ne bayaan jari kiya he ki bajet se pehle jo baithak hogi usamen kendriya vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman se iske liye bajet maangenge
 Obviously, the state government will not have done anything special on its behalf or will not have any money
 ab kendriya swasthya mantri primary health centre main ek saal main 10-10 bistaron vaala isiu banane kii baat kar rahe hai
 Ie 160-bed ICU
 isi maheene 2020 main unke is daawey kii jaanch kar lijiega
 According to our colleague Manish Kumar, there are 16 primary health centers in Muzaffarpur
 manish se baat karte hue civil sarjan shailesh prasad singh ne kaha ki primary health centre main do-do bistaron ke isiu banaae gaye hai, to phir saare mariz muzaffapur kyon aa rahe hai
 Are the patients coming here received treatment according to the guidelines at these primary health centers
 yahi nahin tikaakaran bhi 76 percent ho sakaa
 Not 100% happened
 ek data or detaa hum
 According to the National Sample Survey, there should be 3000 primary health centers in Bihar, but only 1883
 itani kami he
 Will it be ok is sawaal kaa jawaab aapako tab milegaa jab aap saal bhar sau logon ko watsape par gurmarning massej bhejenge
 Many doctors working on public health in India are doing research on this subject
 un sabase of ricard baatcheet hui
 Read many research papers
 jo internet par aapke liye bhi uplabdh hai
 After reading them, it seemed that 100 children of Bihar have not died, they have been killed
 agar system mustaid rahata to garib pariwaron main bacchon kii maut nahin hoti
 Is poverty a reason? Absolutely
 garib hai tabhi to system dhilaa pad gaya
 Only then, their children are malnourished
 tabhi to inaki maut hui he
 Now you heard that death has occurred due to eating litchi
 kai logon ne hansaa
 They did it right
 ve hansate hi to aa rahe hai
 There is no benefit from crying
 medical jarnal he lanset
 It has its own reputation in the world
 iske liye arun shah or tii jacob jon ne ek research paper likhaa tha jo 31 march 2017 ko chapa tha
 Both went to Bihar in 2012 when 178 children died
 jacob jon or arun shah kaa paper bataata he ki muzaffarpur main hone vaali maut kaa sambandh lichi se he
 Is from poverty and malnutrition
 inhone 2012 main record dekha to pataa chalaa ki zyaadaatar bacchon ko subah ke 6 se 7 baje ke bich daure padate hai
 In the simple language of the seizures, the brain of the children started becoming numb
 hota yah he ki lichi subah 4 baje todi jaati he
 Breakers are poor laborers
 raat ko kam khaaya hota he
 On an empty stomach, the parents and children reach and eat it while breaking litchi
 jab kamazor sharir vaala or khaali pet vaala baccha lichi khaataa he to vah acute enciflitis kii chapet main aa jaataa he
 Well, it is called encephalopathy
 dimagi beemaari ke liye is shabd kaa istemaal hota he
 Keep in mind that there is a difference between phyllitis and pathi
 lichi main ek aisa tatv hota he jo kuposhan vaale khaali sharir main glucose kaa bananaa band kar detaa he
 The brain stops working as soon as glucose stops and the liver is affected rapidly after the brain
 baccha mar jaataa he
 It has been suggested in research that if glucose is given to the child immediately then it can be saved
 glucose dene se sharir main insulin banane lagata he or vah brain yani dimag main glucose banane vaale tatwon ko sakriy kar detaa he
 This thing is in public
 yahi lichi jab swasthy sharir kaa koi bhi khayega to use kuch nahi hoga
 If we eat you nothing will happen
 lekin kuposhan kaa shikaar baccha khayega to uske liye ghaatak ho saktaa he
 Correspondents from Bihar's Kashish news channel asked patients and doctors currently admitted in Muzaffarpur hospital about litchi
 to pataa chalaa ki 100 main se 88 logon ne mana ki bachche ne lichi khai he
 The time of April, May, June is related to litchi and they are related to poverty, malnutrition
 neshnal family health survey jo 2015-16 main hua tha uske anusaar bihar main 5 saal ke 44 fisadi bachche kuposhan ke shikaar hai
 You may wonder how poverty is
 bharat kaa rashtriya ausat 36 fisadi he
 The most malnourished people in the world live in India
 117 mulkon main hamaara sthaan 103 he
 So there is no fault in Litchi, there is a problem in Bihar's poverty, in its system
 arun shah or tii jacob ne apane research main bataaya tha ki 2012 main marane vaale bachche food best toxins ke kaaran ineflitis kii chapet main aa gaye
 Dr
 Mukul Das of Lucknow said that litchi may be the reason as Jamaica also has a fruit like litchi in which such symptoms have been observed
 shaayad isliye jamaica ke akhbaar jamekan abzarwar main bhi mujffarpur main lichi se hui maut par report chhapi he
 We received a 2014 report from the Independent newspaper which found a similarity between the deaths in Jamaica and Muzaffarpur
 vahaan lichi jaisi fasal ko eki (ackee) kehete hai, jisase acute encellopathic dizij failaa tha
 The same type of toxic is found in Aiki and Lychee
 donon hi jagah khaae-pie bacchon main is fal kaa koi asar nahin hua
 In Orissa and Saharanpur, such deaths have occurred due to poisonous elements in food
 2016 main odisha ke malkangiri main 100 se adhik bacchon kii maut ho gai thi
 It was also seen that eating the seeds of a particular plant stopped the formation of glucose in the brain and the children started dying
 vahaan par ise lekar jaagrukta failaai gai or ab vahaan se aisi koi soochna nahin he
 t Jacob John named Saharanpur encephalitis
 yani uske kaaran or kairactor alag the
 Muzaffarpur is named as encephalitis because the reason here is litchi
 in vaigyanikon ne bihar ke swasthya mantralay ko salaah bhi di tha ki aise vakt main kya kya karnaa chahie
 Had they been taken, had they been taken, why would more than 100 children have died
 tii jacob jon ne apane ek research paper main likhaa he
 In healthcare, the wrong outcome of an investigation or wrong way of treatment is considered negligent in medicine
 public health yani lok swasthya main galat management ko laaparvaahee mana jaataa he
 The death due to this should be considered murder
 rajya sarkaar ke adhikari maanate hai ki mahamari hone par jaanch kii zimmedaari centre sarkaar kii hoti he
 Health is considered a state subject in Delhi
 rajya kaa kaam he jaanch kare or beemaari kii rokthaam kare
 Unfortunately, its victims are people
 unki awaz kahin nahin hoti he
 i am not telling all this that the government or system or society should be ashamed
 mujhe pataa he do chaar dinon baad sab saamaanya ho jayega
 One way could be that the Bihar government should put up a board in all litchi plantations or make it mandatory to prohibit children who come in the morning to eat litchi on empty stomach
 unke parivaar ko samajhaayen
 Second, the government should work to eliminate malnutrition
 bharat vishwa guru banane vaala he, khaali pet vishwa guru ke class room main baithe in bacchon kii nigaah lichi par hi rahegi jo unki maut kaa intazaar kar rahi hogi
 Think if you raise hundred children of Bihar, then 44 children will get malnutrition
 kya acha lagegaa? thik he ki in masalon par chunaav nahin hote hai lekin janata ne kahaan kaha he ki chunaav ke baad use is kaaran maar diya jaae
 There is pressure on doctors
 aise vakt main ve sarkaar kii hi baat karenge
 They also know that there is not enough system
 jaagarukta ke liye karmchaaree kahaan hai or koun he? jis tarah ke aarthik rup se kamazor tabake main bacchon kii maut hui he vahaan to ghar ghar jaakar jaagarukta failaani hogi
 Have to tell not to eat litchi on an empty stomach
 mid de mil or anganbari kaa dayera badhanaa hoga
 The prevalence of malnutrition suggests that both schemes have failed
 fail he tabhi to shri krishna aspataal main marane vaale bachche purvi champaran se aae hai
 Has come from Samastipur
 begusarai se aae hai
 They have come from Muzaffarpur
 chaar chaar jilon se mariz ek aspataal main pahunche to sochie health system kii kya haalat ho rahi he
 Nidhi, Shahnaz, Asmin Khatoon, Shalwani Kumari, Suganti Kumari, Samreen Parveen, Khushi Kumari, Shitanshu Kumari, Neetu Kumari, Anisha Kumari, Shankar Kumar, Indal Kumar, Prahlad Kumar, Veetu Kumari, Suhani Khatoon, Preity Kumari, Gunjan, Nisha Kumari , Anushka Kumari, Taranum, Sanjit Kumar, Vikas Kumar, Vikrant Kumar, Sabista Parveen, Sunny Kumar, Alok Kumar, Gonnaur Kumar, Nidhi Kumari, Sita Kumari, Muskan Kumari, Sonali Khatoon, Sahida Khatoon, Anjili Kumari, Swati, Jyoti Kumari, Chandni Kumari, Sonu Kumar, Ayush Kumar, Gunja Kumari, Raja Babu, Kahani Kumar, Gudiya, Raveena Kumari, Farzana Khatoon, we cannot name everyone
 kaash sabake naam de paata
 They have been killed due to the negligence of the system, we have included all these names in numbers
 ab kabhi ye naam pukaare nahin ja sakenge
 Something should be called right, maybe someone should make a difference
 muzaffarpur main jo hua he uskaa kaaran virus nahin he
 Lychee is more likely
 japani bukhaar kaa virus maanav sharir main machharon ke zarie aata he
 On rainy days
 jahaan dhan kii kheti hoti he
 Where birds come from abroad
 ve apane saath virus le aate hai
 This is a different disease
 ise bhi enciflitis hi kaha jaataa he
 There is a solution
 beemaari hone ke baad to nahin he magar hone se pehle kaa he
 Japanese fever does not spread if vaccinated
 to aap check karen ki japani bukhaar kaa sarkaar ne tikaakaran aapke ilaake main karavaaya he yaa nahin?is tarah kii beemaari kaa hamalaa saal do saal ke antaraal ke baad hota he
 Until we strengthen the system, fix the hospitals and do not make the campaigns effective 100-100 children will die
 mujffarpur main chaahe to sarkaar is beemaari se hone vaali maut ko roak sakati he
 a question is arising that why is Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar not going to Muzaffarpur? The Chief Minister is doing absolutely fine by not going because this story is alive in the media on the basis of this question
 varanaa unke jane ke baad iske kawarej main sabaki dilchaspee samaapt ho jaaegi
 The emphasis is on why the ministers are not going? The question is another
 mukhyamantri ke jane se hi kya ho jayega? kya bihar kii swasthya vyavastha main gunatmak sudhaar aa jayega? piares yani policy research studies ne bihabaar ke 2018-19 ke swasthya bajet kaa vishleshan kiya he
 Many more information has been found by scrutinizing media reports
 bihar apane bajet kaa 4
 Only 4 percent spends on health
 18 rajyon ke ausat karch se yah kaaphi kam he
 Bihar has one doctor on 17,685 people
 rashtriya ausat 11,097 logon par ek doctor kaa he
 This information was given by Bihar's Health Minister in the Legislative Assembly in 2018
 bihar kii swasthya vyavastha ko samajhnaa he to swasthya mantri kaa naam mat puuchhie
 Just stand on the Ganges Bridge
 bihar bhar se ambulance ke naam par khatara gaadiyaan marizon ko dho kar patna ke privet aspataalon main le aati hai
 She returns with her commission
 is ambulance ke bare main bhi bataanaa chahta hum magar aaj nahin
 Nowadays you must have seen that if the governments are unable to do anything, then ambulances launch vehicles
 mantri ji jhanda dikhaa kar ravaanaa kar dete hai
 After a few years, definitely ask that these vehicles which have left, which hospital they are in, do they even have doctors there
 privet ambulance dhandha kyon ban gaya he? zaahir he aspataal nahin he
 100 children have died
 koi zimmedaar nahin he
 India has called for reform of the international structure to maintain peace and security, proposing its experience of nation building for global efforts towards development and security
 videsh mantri esaem krishna ne sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main shuukravaar ko kaha, "shanti bahaali ke jitne abhiyaanon main jitne shanti kaaryakartaaon kaa yogadan bharat ne kiya he, utana kisi desh ne nahin kiya he
 "krishna was speaking here for the first time after becoming a provisional member of India on the UN Security Council
 shanti evam suraksha banaae rakhane tathaa shanti sthapana ke liye antarrashtriya dhaanche ke sudhaar kaa aahvaan karte hue krishna ne kaha, "samasyaon se nipatane vaali vaishvik takat or kshamtaayen aaj ke chah varsh pehle jo thim, aaj unamem kaaphi bikharaav aa gaya he
 The existing structure should accept these realities and correct the shortcomings
 " krishna ne kaha ki bharat, 19 varsh baad sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main waapas lautaa he
 It has proved transformative for India
 unhone kaha, "ham maanate hai ki prabhavi or sakasham suraksha parishad ham sabhi ke hit main he or ham isaki majbootee ke liye kaam karenge
 "krishna said that India understands the expectations associated with its membership of the Security Council and is really conscious of the effective cohesion between the five permanent members and elected members, especially those whose credentials have been accepted for permanent membership
" is
 krishna ne is baat par khushi jaahir kii ki ghanishtha sahyog kii prakriya aage bad rahi he
 He said, "we are all united on issues related to international peace and security

 Input: IANS gujarat or himachal pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke baad congress or bijepi ke saamne karnataka kii ladaai he
 There is a big difference between the electoral politics of Gujarat and Karnataka, and in the past, the Congress has had a huge upper hand, despite this, the oldest party of the country is working on a strategy contrary to its image here on the lines of Gujarat itself
 haalanki, karnataka main hindutv kaa naaraa buland kar congress muslimon ko ignor karne kii sthiti main najar nahin aa rahi he or aisa dikhaai bhi de rahaa he
 Even if on one side the Congress leader and Karnataka CM
 siddharmaiya congress ke saath khud hindutv kaa asli pratik bataa rahe hon, lekin wo musalamaanon ko bhi saadhane kaa koi mauka nahin ganvaa rahe hai
 Recently, Siddaramaiah shared some pictures on his Twitter account
 25 disambar ko aplod kii gai ye tasviren ek majaar kii hai
 Where CM Siddaramaiah is seen asking for a vow
 itnaa hi nahin unhone topi bhi pahani hui he
 Indeed, Siddaramaiah went to Laxmeshwar in Gadar district
 yahaan unhonehazrat sayed suleman badshaahaki dargah par haath jodakar mannath maangi
 Also served Chinese
 jabaki duusari taraf siddharmaiya ke bayanon par gaur karen to wo lagaataar aresas or bijepi kii tikhi aalochana kar rahe hai
 Even this month, he has also said that there are extremists in BJP and RSS too
 saath hi wo mahabharat kaa zikr karte hue bijepi kii tulana kauravon se kar chuke hai
 The most important Muslim state in South India is the second most Muslim state in India after Kerala
 rajya main kareeb 14 fisadi muslim aabaadi he
 North Karnataka is dominated by Muslims
 khaskar gulberga, bidar, bijapur, raichur or dharwar jaise ilaakon main muslim vot nirnaayak bhoomika main rahete hai
 Out of the total 224 seats in the state assembly, about 60 are considered to be Muslim voters
 dakshin kannada, dharwar, gulberga wo ilaake hai jahaan 20 fisadi se zyada muslim voter hai
 It is also important that there are more number of Muslims in urban areas here
 shahari kshetron main kareeb 21 fisadi or gramin kshetron main kareeb 8 fisadi muslim jansankhya he
 2013 Assembly vote percentage: Congress got 122 seats in 2013 assembly elections
 jabaki janata dal (secular) ko 40, bijepi ko 40, kegepi ko 6, nirdaleeyon ko 9 or anya ke khate main 7 siten gai thim
 Votes Percent Congress - 36
 6%jadyu (es)- 20
 2% BJP- 19
 9%kegepi- 9
 8% Independents - 7
 4%anya- 6
 According to the 1% Muslimlambandmedia reports, the leaders of the Muslim community held a huge meeting even before the rhetoric about Hindutva
 isamen musalamaanon se ovaisi kii party eimm, janata dal (secular) or esadipiai jaise dalon ko vot na karne kii apil kii gai thi
 At the same time there was a call to unite with the Congress against the BJP
 yahi vajah he ki congress or siddharmaiya gujarat kii tarah karnataka main musalamaanon kii upeksha karti abhi nahin dikh rahi he
 Actually, one of the reasons behind this is that the main contest in Gujarat was between BJP and Congress
 musalamaanon ke paas congress ke saath jane ke alaava koi vikalp nahin tha
 While Karnataka has JD (S) and KJP apart from both major national parties
 aise main tipu sultan ke mudde se lekar ab khud ko asli hindu or bijepi ko hindutv kii dushman bataane ke saath congress donon samudaayon ko saadhane kii koshish kar rahi he
 If you are going to enjoy those beautiful moments of love for the first time, then understand that it is not going to be as easy as you are thinking
 haalanki pehali baar sex ke saath kai tarah ke dar bhi jude hote hai
 You have to understand what to do during sex for the first time and more important than that what should not be done
 har kisi kii chahat yahi hoti he kipehali baar sexke dauraan sab kuch sahi ho or vah lambii res kaa ghoda sabit ho
 There are many types of jumps in the mind and interesting stories keep boiling
 haalanki isamen koi buraai nahin he, lekin yah samajhnaa bhi jaruri he ki pehali baar main shaayad wo sab naa ho jo aapke man main he
 The man wants that for the first time, he can go on for much longer than full of love
 lekin orgasm jaldi ho jaae to ghabaraane kii bilkul bhi jarurat nahin he
 At first, the problem arises with many people getting excited, but do not get upset about this
 iske baad agar aap kuntha main hai to aap galat hai
 If nothing happened in the first time, as you were thinking, then know that you will always have a second chance
 mahilaonke liye pehali baar pyaar ke wo lamhe dardanaak ho sakate hai, lekin ghabaraaen nahin
 Actually, they are not afraid of pain
 zyaadaatar maamalon main dard sirf chinkoti kaatane jaisaa hota he
 Only fear of pain can ruin those beautiful moments
 isi dar ke kaaran chhuan maatr se bhi mahilaayein ghabaraane lagati hai
 At such a time, the responsibility of their partner increases considerably
 aise vakt main mahila ko is baat kaa aashwaasan den ki aap unke saath hai
 Take sufficient foreplay to enjoy those beautiful moments of love and comfort
 shuruyaat main ungali or phir aage intercorse kii ore badhen
 Slow speed and moderation is the key to success
 pehali baar sex ko lekar sabase zyada bhraamak baat yahi he ki pehali baar mahila ko bleeding yani khun aana jaruri he
 However, it is not like that
 sheel bhang ke kaaran khun aata he or hamen yah samajhane kii bhi jarurat he ki sheelbhang cycle chalaane, vyaayaam, aadi kai anya kaarnon se bhi bhang ho saktaa he
 In many cases it does not occur at birth
 mahilaon ke hastmaithun ke kaaran bhi sheelbhang ho saktaa he
 Whether you are bleeding or not, when you are near your partner, you have to show confidence in it and do it
 agar koi bhi shaq ho to ise bedroom tak le jane kii bajaay pehle hi sulajhaa lenaa chahie

 dalhauzi road ban jaayegaa itihaas, nayaa naam hoga 'daara shikoh road'
 Yes, like Aurangzeb Road and Race Course Road, now the name of Dalhousie Road in Delhi has been changed
 nai dilli ilaake ke south block main endiemasi ke antargat aane vaale dalhauzi road kaa nayaa naam 'daara shikoh' road hoga
 The NDMC has approved this new name in the council meeting held on Monday
 jaldi hi endiemasi nae naam ke liye notification jari karegi
 Actually Meenakshi Lekhi, BJP MP and NDMC member from New Delhi, proposed to change the name of Dalhousie Road to Dara Shikoh Road
 jise endiemasi ne council baithak main paas kar diya
 The AAP leaders accused the BJP of doing naming politics
 The Aam Aadmi Party has raised questions on the politics of changing the streets after one
 endiemasi sadsy or dilli kaint se aap vidhayak commando surendra ke mutabik centre main baithi bijepi endiemasi kaa raajnneetikaran kar rahi he
 Commando Surendra, while objecting to the name 'dara Shikoh', said that when the name of Aurangzeb Road was changed then why is the BJP quick to name another member of the Mughal family
 commando surendra ke mutabik punjab or goa main haar sweekaar kar chuki bijepi mughalon ke sahare upi kii naiya paar lagaana chaahati he
 Actually the commando Surendra Dalhousie Road was proposed to be named after Maharaja Suraj Mal
 lekhi ne di safibijepi saansad minakshi lekhi ne namakaran kii raajnneeti ke aaropon ko sire se khaarij karte hue kaha ki "jab aurangzeb road kaa naam badla ja rahaa tha tab bhi daara shikoh naam rakhane kii baat chali thi
 But then due to the death of former President APJ Abdul Kalam, he was named as APJ Abdul Kalam Road, honoring him
 daara shikoh mogul shaasha shahjahan ke bade bete the, jinhone hindu-muslim ekta ko badhaava diya
 Dara Shikoh was a noble of brotherhood, brotherhood and art, we are all indebted to him
 unhen sammaan dene ke liye bahut samay se koshish jari thim
 That is why his name was chosen
 " raja surajmal isliye nahin kiya gaya kyonki kanoon ke mutabik jiske naam par ek baar koi sadak yaa colony kaa naam rakh diya gaya ho uske naam par phir se naam nahin rakh sakate
 We all respect Raja Surajmal but there is already Surajmal Vihar in his name in East Delhi
 isiilie unka naam nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 Satyendra Jain also targeted the Minister: AAP minister Satyendra Jain also called the renaming of roads in the name of politics in view of UP elections
 to vahiin lekhi ne aam aadmi party par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki is par jo raajnneeti karnaa chaah rahi he, usase bache
 Where is the concern of Aam Aadmi Party Delhi
 wo to punjab or goa main vyast he
 That is why do not try to divide people in the name of religion and caste
 aapako bataa den ki dalhauzi road se pehle res course road kaa naam lok kalyaan maarg or aurangzeb road kaa naam badalakar dow apije abdul kalam road kiya ja chukaa he
 Changing name means tampering with history
 What do historians think about changing names of the people? Aaj Tak spoke to Delhi's chief historian Feroze Bakht Ahmed on this issue
 unke mutabik, "naam badalanaa matlab itihaas se chhedchhad, is tarah kii koshish nahi honi chahie, har kisi ke naam kaa kuch mahatv rahaa hoga
 Dalhousie was an officer of the British, there are many things to his name in Himachal

 ham america prashasan dwaara is mudde par ek vivekpurna ravaiye kii saraahna karte hai
 At a time when there are protests in the country over the Land Acquisition Act and the debate on the coal bill is hot, the government is trying to pass the Mines and Minerals (regulation) Amendment Bill related to the country's natural wealth and resources
 ise mins and mineral (deveopment and regulation – amendament) bill bhi kaha jaataa he
 If you look closely, this bill has more loopholes than the other two proposed bills
 
 
 abhi is par sansad kii select cameti bahes kar rahi he
 According to sources, many members of the committee have objected to many points of the bill and the passage of this bill in the Rajya Sabha is not easy unless it is done with heavy amendments
 enditivi india ne is kanoon kaa dhyaan se adhyayan kiya or is par jaankaron se baat kii, jisase pataa chalata he ki is kanoon ke banane ke baad bhi sarkaar ke tamaam khanij bhandaron ke nilaamee ke daawey dhare rah jaaenge
 Let us first understand what this bill is
 bharat main 1957 se chale aa rahe kanoon ko badalane ke liye saal 2010 main ek nae kanoon kaa prastaav aayaa, lekin vah prastaav 2014 tak kanoon nahin ban sakaa
 The new government has introduced amendments to the old law of 1957 in place of that new bill
 ye sanshodhan aise badlaav hai jo kisi had tak mining bill ko kamazor karte hai
 With the introduction of this bill according to the government, the allocation of mines of iron ore, bauxite, lime stone and manganese will be on auction basis
 sarkaar yah bhi bataa rahi he ki is kanoon ke ban jane ke baad baaki khanijon kii nilaamee se vaisaa hi phayda hoga, jaisaa koyala khadaanon kii tazaa nilaamee se hua he
 If you read the bill, para 10 of the amendment bill for it
 e
 1 says that after the enactment of this law, all the old applications related to mining will be canceled
 lekin isi bill ke agle para main kaha gaya he ki jin companiyon ko khojbin or survey ke liye ijazat (riconicense permit) or procepective license (yani kaam shuru karne kaa license) de di gai he, ve bane rahenge
 Today the reality is that more than 80 percent of the known mineral deposits in the country have been given investigative surveys or prospecting licenses
 aise main sawaal yah he ki nayaa kanoon kis kaam kaa hoga
 Sudeep Srivastava, a lawyer and mining expert who was a petitioner in the coal case, says, "now much money is being received in the coal block auction because the Supreme Court canceled all 214 coal blocks, but this mining bill does not cancel the old mineral deposits
" But rather legalizes them
 ' Srivastava says that almost all known mineral deposits in the country have been given through a survey or prospective license, which this new law will not repeal
 vah chhattisgarh kaa udhaaharan dete hue kehete hai, 'chhattisgarh main kaverdha louh ayask ke bhandar ko chhod den to baaki khadaanon kii yaa to mining leez ho chuki he yaa companiyon ke paas unka prospective license he
 In such a situation, what will this law do? saaf he ki is kanoon ke aane ke baad ek ore jahaan badi sankhya main khanij bhandaron kii nilaamee nahin ho paaegi, vahiin ye vidheyak chaalu khadaanon kii leez kii miyaad ko bhi ek jatke main 30 saal se badhaakar 50 saal kar rahaa he
 Right now, the increase in the period rests with the state governments, where they decide according to the benefit of the state
 yahaan mahatvapurn he ki is vakt goa, bellari or shah kamishan kii jaanch main fansi bahut sari khadaanon main kai tarah ke vivaad he
 For 50 years in one stroke, all these mines will remain in the hands of those private companies which are in the dock
 is bill ko sarkaar loksabhaa main apane bahumat ke dam par paas kara chuki he, lekin rajyasabha main vipaksh ke dabaav ke chalate use yah bill select cameti ko bhejnaa padaa
 But the Select Committee has been given only seven days for consideration which seems inadequate
 select cameti ke sadsy or sipiai saansad di raja kehete hai, 'maujuuda swaroop main yah ek trutipurna bill he jo na to adivaasiyon ke hiton kii raksha karata he or na hi rajyon ke adhikaron kaa khyal rakhata he
 ' sach yah bhi he ki 2010 ke prastaavit bill main munaafe ke 26 fisadi hisse ko adivaasiyon ke kalyaan main kharch karne kaa praavdhaan tha
 The much talked-about parity decision also calls for spending at least 20 per cent of the profits on tribal welfare, but the current bill stipulates spending only a third of the royalty, which will be less than 10 per cent of the profits
 samvidhan ke hisaab se saare khanij rajya kii sampatti hai
 In such a way, the way this amendment bill is cutting the authority of states is also in controversies
 misaal ke taur par koun sa khanij bhandar kis aakaar kaa khanij bhandar kis tarah diya jayega yah sab nirdhaaran kaa adhikaar bhi centre sarkaar ne apane paas rakhaa he
 The state governments will do the auction in future, but its terms will be finalized by the central government

 But the VHP passed the resolution, the proposal should be passed from the cabinet on the lines of Somnath and legislation should be made

 We should try to build consensus at the national level

 Many questions can arise on the making of laws in Parliament
 aise main sankhya hone ke baad bhi sahmati ke saath chalanaa acha he yaa phir jhagada karke aage baduya
 It does not appear possible to have an agreement between the two parties
 shuruyaat main sangh parivaar aakraamak tha, lekin jab sarkaar ke khilaaf kuch virdohi maahaul bana to parivaar sarkaar ke peeche lamaband dikh rahaa he
 What is the reason? Some personal views should not be taken as the party's stand
 jahaan tak parivaar ke sanghathanon kaa sawaal he to main ek baat saaf kahuunga ki ve sabhi swatantra or sakvamanit sanghathan hai
 Those who are prominent among them are dedicated people working for a long time
 unke apane vichaar honge or ve apane vichaar saarvajanik dhang se vyakt bhi karenge
 We will not give gag orders to everyone
 aapako nahin lagata ki sarkaar ke khilaaf jo ek chhavi bani he, usase sangh parivaar chintit he isliye lamaband hue hai?hamaari sarkaar acha kaam kare yahi kaamana hamaare parivaar sanghathanon kii he
 From time to time they also have concerns, if they explain to the party and the government in private, and we have no objection to it if we have to take a public stance whenever the need arises

 isliye hamane bmes, kisaan sangh, swadeshi jaagran manch khadaa kiya he
 As far as the Sangh is concerned, i myself have been a campaigner for over three decades and can say that the Sangh has never been a relative organization of the government
 lekin pachhali endie sarkaar ke saath aresas ke kadave anubhav rahe hai
 i was the spokesman of the Sangh during the previous government
 kai masalon par sarkaar se baatcheet chalati thi
 Some organizations had different views on certain issues
 isliye pichhali sarkaar ke samay bahut jhagada tha, ye sach nahin he
 But this time, with experience from the previous government, how to get more synergy, started efforts from day one

 According to the corporation, the roads selected for this include the roads in Model Town and Kamla Nagar areas

 kya dilli ke safadarajang airforce stesan kii suraksha ko lekar koi nayaa khatra paidaa ho gaya he? kam se kam airforce to isi baat kaa hawala dekar airforce stesan or jaipur polo ground ke bich oonchi diwaar khadi kar rahi he
 The development of polo games in the country and the organization of the Polo Games in the country, and the Indian Polo Association (IPO) and the Indian Air Force, so much so that the matter reached the Delhi High Court
 polo association ne airforce par aapraadhik ravaiye kii dhamkiyaan dene or association kii jameen kaa gheraav karne kaa aarope lagaaya he to vahiin airforce ne jameen par diwaar banane ko lekar suraksha kaarnon kii safai di he
 Walls of the Wall: The scuffle between the Polo and the Airforce in the Delhi High Court began in March 2016 when the Airforce started building the wall between the Safdarjung Air Force Station and the Jaipur Polo Ground
 ipie ne pehali chitthee 19 march ko airforce ke commanding afasar pawan mohai ko likhi jisamen airforce kii gaiyrkanoonee diwaar ke nirmaan par sawaal puche
 March elapsed, April elapsed, May elapsed and June elapsed
 airforce diwaar to banaati rahi lekin 14 july tak chitthiyon kaa koi jawaab nahin diya
 Thus, Delhi High Court against the IPA Air Force reached the shelter
 hoicourt main maindamas rit yani paramadesh lekh daakhil kar ipie ne airforce se saare nirmaan rokane or yathasthiti behaal karne kii maang kii he
 In the letter dated 14 July, the Air Force cited the Pathankot airbase attack
 Finally, on 14 July, the Chief Administrative Officer of the Air Force Station, Aditya Jain, gave some reason for the construction of the wall
 In view of khaastaur par pathankot airbase par hue hamale ke baad
 Not only this, the construction of the wall has been approved by the Ministry of Urban Development
 vaise bhi jaipur polo ground kaa upyog airforce or ipie donon karte rahe hai
 "airforce intentions are bad" Adiraj Singh, Steward of the Delhi Zone of IPA, says that the mistake in Air Force's intentions is evident from the fact that she talks about the common use of this land till now
 agar baat sirf suraksha kii hoti to airforce is diwaar kaa nirmaan airforce stesan or jaipur polo ground kii seemaa par karata naa ki polo ground ke bichon- bich
 Advocate Amit Tyagi, who filed the petition on behalf of the IPA, said that the Air Force wants illegal occupation of the Polo Ground land, citing the fear and security of Pathankot airbase
 is diwaar kaa nirmaan kar airforce jo kar rahi he wo fouj ke sammaan or mulyon ke khilaaf he
 However, the case is scheduled for hearing in October
 rafel (rafale) par congress or bijepi ke bich ladayeejari he
 If the Congress (congress) is alleging a huge scam in this deal, the Modi government (modi Govt) denies it
 rafel saude kii jaanch kii maang se judinyachikaaon ko supreme court (supreme court) khaarij kar chukaa he
 However, Prashant Bhushan and Arun Shourie have now also filed a review petition in the court
 sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main bhi yah maamla khub gunj rahaa
 While Rahul Gandhi has once called Rafael a deal worth one lakh 30 thousand crores, Arun Jaitley made it clear in the Lok Sabha that the total deal is only 58 thousand crores
 baad main rahul gandhi ne jetali ke aankade par hi press conference kar palatwaar kiya
 He said that the government says that the price is confidential, then how Jaitley accepted the deal of 58 thousand crores
 is prakaar 36 vimaanon kii sankhya se bhaag dene par ek vimaan kii keemat 16 sau karod baithti he
 Jaitley asks where the figure of 1600 is coming from, he himself has disclosed the price
 rahul ne phir doharaaya ki paanch sau karod ke vimaan modi sarkaar ne kyon 1600 karod main kharide?yah deal kyon hui, kab hui, kaise hui, kiske bich hui, aarope kya hai, supreme court kaa kya kahana he or sarkaar ke kya jawaab hai, isse jude dheron sawaal aam aadmi ke man main kaundh rahe hai
 Here we will try to explain you the whole story of Rafale Deal through 10 such key questions
 jetali ne kaha, "rafel mudda niti, prashasnic yaa shashan kaa vishay nahin he
 It is a matter of investigation whether the deal is clean or not? The Supreme Court has said that 'we are' satisfied 'about the price, HAL and offset
 ' jaanch main JPC kya karegi ?" is dauraan jetali ne boforce saude ke dauraan gathit jepisi kaa mudda bhi uthaate hue kaha ki "divangat shankaranand kii adhyakshata main samiti ne jo report di usamen kaha gaya ki rishwat nahin di gai balki vinding ap bhugtan kiya gaya
 In this way, the JPC smashed the issue of corruption
 " congress par tanj kasate hue unhone kaha, "sarvocch nyaayalay kaa vivek santusht hua, lekin congress ke chunaavon kii aavashyaktaa kii santushti nahin hui
 "the government's answer - the government has no role in it
 dasolt se echeel ko nirdhaarit samay-seemaa ke bhitarvimaanon ke nirmaan kaa bharosa nahin mil sakaa
 Due to the deadlock in the negotiations, Dassault did not put HAL at the center of the deal
 dasolt reliance dephence sahit kareeb sau ofaset partner ke saath kaam karegaa

 notebandi par jari siyaasi ghamaasan ke bich sarkaar ab plastic ke note laane kii taiyaari main he
 Minister of State for Finance Arjun Ram Meghwal gave this information in Parliament on Friday
 unhone bataaya ki ab plastic kii karency chhaapi jaaegi, iske liye kaccha maal kharida ja he
 The Reserve Bank of India has been planning to launch plastic currency for quite some time
 farvari 2014 main sarkaar ne sansad ko jaankaree di thi ki 10 rupee vaale ek arbaplastic notchape jaaenge or inke field trial ke liye 5 shahar chune gaye hai
 These cities were Kochi, Mysore, Jaipur, Shimla and Bhubaneswar
 kaise hote hai plastic ke note, kya he inaki khaasiyatplastic se bane karency note paper vaale noton kii tulana main saaf-suthere hote hai
 These are also called polymer notes
 plastic ke noton kii ausat umr kareeb paanch saal hoti he
 That is, more than double the notes of paper
 plastic noton kii nakal utaarna aasaan nahin hota he
 According to one study, plastic notes reduce global warming by 32% and energy demand by 30% as compared to paper notes
 plastic vaale noton kaa vajan paper vaale noton kii tulana main kam hota he
 In such a situation, their transportation and distribution is also easy
 kaagaj vaale puraane noton ko nasht karne ke liye jalaana padataa he jabaki plastic vaale noton ko ricycle kar chharre banaae jate hai yaa phir inhen plastic kii duusari chijen banaai ja sakati hai
 The practice of such notes first began in Australia
 1988 main uthaae gaye is kadam kaa makasad jaali noton or blike mani kaa chalan rokna tha
 The current trend of polymer notes is in more than 20 countries to date
 inamen australia ke alaava canada, fiji, morishas, newjiland, papua new gini, romania or vietnam shaamil hai

 Also, Jasprit Bumrah has also emerged as the most reliable fast bowler in India in the last two years, who is also economical and is also in the lead in getting wickets

 shami, rabindra jadeja The Chinese military has offered to hold a flag meeting amid the deadlock in the Ladakh region
 vahiin bhartiya sena vaastavik niyantran rekha ke us ilaake par chaukasee banaae hue he, jahaan chini sainikon ne pichley 10 din se ghuspaith kar rakhi he
 Army sources said here that China has requested for a flag meeting and this is being considered
 unhone bataaya ki kshetra main chini sainikon kii gatividhiyon par sena najar rakhe hue he or aas-paas ke ilaakon main tainaat sena kii tukadiyon ko bhi satark rahane ko kaha gaya he
 There have been two flag meetings in the last 10 days, but no progress has been made in resolving the crisis
 is gatirodh kii prishthbhumi main sena pramukh dalbir singh suhaag ne bhutan kii apni chaar divasiy yatra ko kal radd kar diya
 Chinese soldiers have buried their tents in the area and Chinese helicopters have been seen dropping food packets for the troops
 in helicopteron ne haalanki bhartiya vaayu seemaa kaa ulanghan nahin kiya
 The dropped food packets were later collected by Jan Mukti Sena (PLA) personnel
 kshetra main ravivaar ko tanaav us samay utpann hua jab apane kshetra main ek sadak nirmaan kar rahe kuch chini shramik bhartiya ilaake main ghus aae or daawa kiya ki unhen aadesh mili hai ki ve bhartiya kshetra ke 5 kilometre bheetar tible tak nirmaan kaary karen
 Last year, the Chumar area in Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO) had been the point of deadlock for a fortnight, when China objected to building overhead bunkers in Indian territory
 april-may 2013 main dibio main yojit flag meeting main hue samjhaute se vah gatirodh samaapt hua tha or bharat ne chumaar kshetra main kuch overhead banksron ko hataa liya tha
 In winter this year, Chinese soldiers tried to enter the area by riding horses
 yah kshetra chini sainikon kii ore se aksar ghuspaith ke prayaason kaa gavaah rahaa he
 Female voting in the country brings a strange contradiction
 rashtriya or rajya chunaavon main vot daalane main mahilaon kii hissedari main to lagaataar ijapha ho rahaa he lekin sansad or vidhansabhaon main unke pratinidhitiv main khaas gati nahin dikh rahi he
 In 1971, the share of women voters was just 48 percent, while in 1984 the figure increased to 60 percent
 mote taur par us saal mahila vot pratishat main badhotaree kii vajah indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad upji sahanubhuti lahar thi
 Although a decline of more than 10 percent was observed in 1991, there has been a dramatic increase in the female turnout percentage since then
 pichley dashak main, khaskar 2009 ke baad, mahila matadaataaon par vishesh focus badha to sansadeey or vidhansabha chunaavon main unki hissedari kaa purushon ke mukaable antar kaaphi kam ho gaya he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, 67
 1 pratishat purushon kii tulana main mahilaon kaa matdaan 65
 Was 3 percent
 isliye jahaan 1967 main mahilaon kaa matdaan pratishat purushon se 11
 By 2014, the percentage of voting percentage between the two was reduced to just 1 percent
 8 pratishat rah gaya
 Nevertheless, the nationwide political system still remains largely dominated by men and remains a stronghold of patriarchy
 lihaaja, sansad or vidhansabhaon main mahila pratinidhitiv kaaphi kam he
 Number of women Lok Sabha members 4 in 1952
 7 pratishat se badhkar 2014 main 11
 4 percent
 haalanki rajyasabha main 2014 main mahila saansadon kii sankhya thodi adhik 15 pratishat thi
 Percentage of women mps in Lok Sabha 6 in 1962
 3 pratishat or 1977 main 3
 Was 5 percent (by far the lowest)
 1984 main, jab chunaav se thik pehle indira gandhi kii hatya ho gai thi, congress se badi sankhya main mahila ummidavaar nirvaachit (42 main se 38) huin or mahila saansadon kaa pratishat 7
 Up to 9 percent
 agle chunaav main is sankhya main giravat ai
 But there has been a gradual increase since the early 1990s
 2009 main, sansad main mahilaon kii hissedari 10
 5 percent which was 11 in 2014 with slight increase
 4 pratishat ho gai
 In all elections, the election percentage of women mps has been higher than the percentage of women candidates
 rajnatik dal daawa karte hai ki ve purushon kii tulana main kam mahila ummidavaaron ko isliye utaarte hai kyonki mahilaon ke jeetne kii sambhaavna kam hoti he
 Nevertheless, the data on the proportion of women mps winning compared to women candidates suggests that women candidates 'election-winning potential' is much higher than men
 yah virodhabhas rajyon main or bhi adhik tikhaa he
 In recent times, the voting percentage of women has been higher than men in major assembly elections
 phir bhi, vidhansabhaon main mahila vidhayakon kaa pratishat sansad kii tulana main lagaataar kam hota rahaa he
 This stark contrast is in stark contrast to the voting trends of other sections of the electorate
 masalan, mandal ayog kii report lagu hone ke baad pichhadi jati ke matadaataaon ke badhate matdaan pratishat ke saath sansad or vidhansabhaon main anya pichhadaa varg (obisi) kaa pratinidhitiv bahut badha he
 Despite high turnout, under-representation of women can only be compared to minorities, especially Muslims, who have not been able to increase their representation in Parliament or legislatures (except in Jammu and Kashmir) despite heavy turnout
 zyada mahila ummidavaaron ko chunaav main utaarne ke dabaav main rajnatik dal anusuchit jatiyon or anusuchit janajatiyon ke liye arakshit nirvachan kshetron main mahila pratyaashiyon ko utaar kar itishree kar le rahe hai
 Political scientist Francesca R
 of Norway Institute of International Affairs
 jensenius kaa kahana he, ''rajnatik dal arakshit nirvachan kshetron main purush netaaon ko anya kshetron ke mukaable tuchh maanate hai
 The parties often follow the hierarchy of caste system within their organization
 " carnegi endoment ke james si gaithar phelo jemi hinston kaa akalan he ki 1980 or 2014 ke bich, loksabhaa kii saat pratishat arakshit siton par mahilaayein ummidavaar thim to saamaanya siton par yah aankada keval 4
 Was 8 percent
 rajnatik dal arakshit nirvachan kshetron main adhik mahila ummidavaaron ko maidan main utaarte hai, isliye loksabhaa chunaav jeetne vaali mahilaon kaa ek bada hissaa inhen siton se he
 According to Hinston, "since 1980, an average of 16 in reserved constituencies
 2 pratishat mahila ummidavaar vijayi rahi hai jabaki saamaanya siton par 11
 5 percent of women candidates won
 "1952 or 1991 ke bich, arakshit or anarakshit siton ke bich mahilaon kii ummidavaari daron main bada antar nahin he
 Issues such as caste-based reservation for Ayodhya and jobs after 1991 led to polarization and triggered heavy competition among political parties which also reflected the difference in the number of women and men in the election season
 1996 se mahila aarakshan vidheyak ke liye sangharsh shuru hua
 As a result, the distinction between reserved and unreserved constituencies for women candidates has become more pronounced
 mahilaon ke matdaan pratishat main badhotaree ke baavjood kaaphi kam pratinidhitiv kaa yah virodhabhas panchayat chunaavon main nahin dikhataa kyonki panchayaton main mahilaon ke liye ek-tihaai se lekar aadhi siten tak arakshit hai
 The advocates of the Women's Reservation Bill have been demanding one-third reservation for women in the Lok Sabha since 1996
 bhaajapa or congress donon hi, is vidheyak ke paksh main hone kaa daawa karti hai phir bhi yah vidheyak adhar main lataka hua he

 Meanwhile, AAP MP Sanjay Singh told NDTV that the Congress has not started any official discussion on the alliance yet
 jo bhi formula aa rahaa he vah tivi main or media main de rahe hai
 We have not found any formula
 jo bhi formula aa rahaa he vah TV main or media main de rahe hai
 We have not got any formula or any formal proposal from Congress
 congress ko jo prastaav sharad pavaar ke zarie bhijwaya tha usapar bhi koi jawaab nahin aayaa he
 He said that what Arvind Kejriwal said in Visakhapatnam is about the first meeting with Rahul Gandhi
 jisamen kuch nayaa nahin kyonki, rahul gandhi se uske baad koi meeting nahin hui he
 At the same time, State Congress President Sheila Dikshit said that all the seven seats of Delhi will have Congress candidates
 aam aadmi party (aam Aadmi Party) ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar unka purana rukh barkaraar dikhaa
 When NDTV asked him if there will be Congress candidates in all the seven seats in Delhi? He said yes
 dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal (arvind Kejriwal) ne kaha ki aam aadmi party ke congress se gathbandhan ko lekar unhone rahul gandhi se mulaakaat kii thi
 Sheila Dixit is not such an important leader
 unhone kaha ki rahul ne gathbandhan se inkaar kar diya he
 When he was asked that you said that the alliance will be decided today, Sheila Dikshit said, 'I did not say, it will be done today
 wo to jisko faisla karnaa he wo kare
 He confirmed that Congress candidates will contest in all the seven seats
 udhar vishaakhpatnam main aaj dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal (arvind Kejriwal) ne kaha ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi (rahul Gandhi) ne loksabhaa chunaav ke liye nai dilli main aam aadmi party (AAP) ke saath gathbandhan karne se inkaar kar diya he
 During an interaction with reporters, the AAP chief said that he had recently met Gandhi
 congress adhyaksh ne 'aap' ke saath chunaav ladane se inkaar kar diya
 On Delhi Congress President Sheila Dikshit's statement that she did not contact him, Arvind Kejriwal said, "we met Rahul Gandhi
" dikshit (sheila Dikshit) itani mahatvapurn netaa nahin hai
 Kejriwal is constantly appealing to the Congress to form an alliance to keep the BJP away from power in the Lok Sabha elections
 party sutron ne kaha tha ki gathbandhan ke mudde par dilli congress banty hui he
 Dixit and his three working presidents are opposing the alliance
 congress ke ek ucch padasth sutara ne haal hi main kaha tha ki dilli ke dirghakaalik parinaamon par dhyaan dete hue gathbandhan kii sambhaavna kam he
 The source said, 'the big question is how the AAP will compete with the Congress in the 2020 elections

 The split in the party in Punjab, then the CD scandal of Minister Sandeep Kumar, then the letter of MLA Devendra Shehrawat and then Anna Hazare's statement followed by party MLA Pankaj Pushkar also raised many serious questions on the top leadership
 anna kii chintaa party ke liye khatre kii ghantiam aadmi party ke timarpur sevidhayak pankaj pushkarane kaha he ki anna hajaare ne jo chintaa jaahir kii he vah bilkul sahi he
 Pankaj has said that we cannot ignore Anna Hazare's concern, his comment means that now is the time for the party to ring the danger bell
 party main asahmati ke swar uthaanaa galatapankaj pushkar ne 'aaj tak' se baatcheet main kaha he ki aisa lagata he ki is party main asahmati darj nahin kara sakate hai kyonki asahmati ko party netritv,anushaasanheenatakarar detaa he jab kabhi party main koi asahmati darj kar aata he to use party netritv gaddaar bataa detaa he
 Aam Aadmi Party MLA Pankaj Pushkar from Nindak Nire Rakhietimarpur says that when the Aam Aadmi Party was being formed many committees were formed to strengthen the democratic system in the party, but gradually all the committees are being abolished i
e
 The democracy of itself is getting destroyed
 duusari partiyon kii tarah AAP bhi andeh ke ghere menvidhayak pankaj pushkar kaa pankaj ne kaha ki jis tarah se aam aadmi party kii karypranali hoti ja rahi he aisa katai nahin lagata ki yah party ek alag tareeke se kaam karne ke liye bani thi, nai tarah kii raajnneeti to chhodie duusari tamaam partiyon kii tarah hi isaki kaaryastylee hoti ja rahi he
 The party should not close any shop, whenever it wants, recently when Arvind Kejriwal said that he will not tolerate wrongdoing in the party, even if he does not have to close the party
 is bayaan par pankaj pushkar kaa kahana he ki party loktantric vyavastha se chalati he or ise bhang karne ke liye loktantric prakriya hi apnaani padegi
 Kejriwal's statement shows that he is not running the party with democracy
 party main chapaluson se ghire hai kejarivalpankaj pushkar ne kaha ki meraa man nahin karata he ye baat maanane kaa, par yah sach he ki ab party main unhen hi pasand kiya ja rahaa he jo haa main haa milaate hai, kuch log to aise hai jo ankhon main ankhen daal kar juthi tarifen bhi karte hai
 Such people are being respected in the party, Pankaj Pushkar said while addressing Netaji to the Chief Minister that now some people speak flattering, not fair to the party

 The Arcade Business College, which has been running since 1998, has been provided with the college even if it does not have its own land and buildings, whereas such temporary provision cannot be granted for more than 4 years

 It is being said that the d Company has created its new headquarters
 yah nayaa headquarter america ke belize main banaaya gaya he
 Aaj Tak has made a big disclosure of how d Company is changing both its identity and personality
 kaise wo duniya ke alag-alag hisson main failaa rahaa he apana jaal
 This new base of d Company was revealed when Indian agencies discovered that Dawood Ibrahim's brother Anees Ibrahim had acquired the Belize country passport
 is passport kaa number he -A001407 or is passport ko istemaal kiya anis ibrahim ne
 That is, on the basis of this passport, Anees Ibrahim took Belize citizenship
 sajeesh ke tahar badali naagariktasutron ke mutabik anis ibrahim ne 2 sintabar 1996 ko hi bhartiya passport dubai ke counsllet main jamaa kara diye the
 Since then, Indian agencies had suspected that Anees is traveling to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia on passports of another country
 ek lambii jaanch padtaal ke baad bhartiya jaanch agenciyon ko dubai se hi khabar mili ki anis ibrahim ne madhya america ke mulk belize kii naagarikta le lee he or dubai se hi usne beliz kaa ye passport hasil kar liya he
 Investigating officer of Mumbai bomb blasts OP Chatwal, who had issued an Interpol Red Corner notice against Dawood and Anees, told that under the conspiracy Dawood's brother Anees acquired Belize citizenship
 jab bharat sarkaar ko iskaa pataa chalaa to sarkaar ne dabaav banaakar is passport ko radd karavaaya
 But Anees' intrigue behind it was far more dangerous
 daud bhi ab daud nahin rahabharat sarkaar ne anis kii passport to radd karvaa diya lekin sawaal barkaraar he ki passport ke saath hi kya madhya america ke is jananath se khatarnaak di company ke footprint khatm ho gaye yaa beliz ab bhi bana hua he di company kaa mahfuj thikaana
 Don is changing identity from one country to another and the international police is still carrying his old identity in his hand
 sirf anis hi nahin he jisane apni shinaakht badal daali he
 Dawood Ibrahim has also changed Chola
 yahaan tak ki mumbai hamalon kaa mukhya aaropee tiger memon bhi ab tiger memon nahin rahaa
 The mastermind of the 1993 Mumbai blasts and the most dangerous pawn of Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI
 wo shaks jiskaa naam sunakar mumbai ke bade se bade bilderon kii ruh kaanp jaati he, is shaks kaa naam he tiger memon
 Jamal became Tiger Memon, but no one knows this mastermind of Mumbai bomb blasts in Pakistan by the name of Tiger Memon
 vahaan tiger memon kaa naam he jamaal
 In Pakistan, people know Tiger Memon as Jamal
 yah khulaasa bhi kiya he opi chatwaal ne
 Chatwal said that India has such evidence that Pakistan has made Tiger Memon and his family a real passport on fake names
 passport par tiger kii asli photo he lekin naam nakli he
 The name of Tiger Memon is Jamal
 daud ke paas hai kai passporttiger ke baad baat daud ibrahim kii
 Dawood's new name is Sheikh Dawood Hasan
 pakistan main use isi naam se janaa jaataa he
 But Dawood has not only one but several passports in Pakistan
 or ye passport pakistan ke aalaa afasaron ne khud don ke haath main saunpe hai
 With these passports, Dawood Ibrahim is traveling from Saudi Arabia to Singapore unhindered
 is baat kii tasadeeq bhi mumbai bam dhamaakon ke jaanch adhikari or maujuuda vakt main sibiai ke kansaltent opi chatwaal ne kii
 It is clear from these revelations that the Interpol notice issued in the name of Dawood has no meaning
 kyonki daaud ne apni shinaakht hi puri tarah badal lee he
 Probably, on this basis, Pakistan repeatedly maintains that it does not have a person named Dawood Ibrahim
 deraa pramukh ram rahim kii raajadaar haniprit ke gaayab laptop or diary kii jaankaree dene main vifal rahi vipashyana aaj phir poochtacha ke liye panchakula police ke saamne pesh hogi
 Earlier, he and Honeypreet were interrogated together on 13 October
 vipashyana ko panchakula ke sector 23 police thana main hajir hone ke liye kaha gaya he
 According to police sources, the police want to know the answers to many such questions from Vipassana which still remain a puzzle
 in sawaalon main gaayab laptop or diary ke alaava deraa kii benami sampattiyon se jude sawaal bhi honge
 However, the focus of police interrogation is still the case of the violence that erupted on August 25 and the treason of a dozen others including Honeypreet
 police vipashyana se yah bhi jaananaa chaahati he ki kya vah 17 agast kii sirsa baithak main maujuud thi yaa nahin
 Significantly, during Friday's interrogation, Honeypreet accused Vipassana that she was also present in this meeting
 vipashyana ne is sawaal kaa golmol jawaab diya tha
 On Friday, the police have seized Vipassana and Honeypreet face to face
 poochtacha se pehle jahaan donon ek duusare se gale milakar khub roi thi uske baad donon ke bich main kuch sawaalon ko lekar takaraar bhi hui
 The warp had increased so much that the police had to intervene
 ab police haniprit or vipashyana ke jawaab aapas main milakar dekhegi or unhen asamanta paae jane par phir se poochtacha karegi
 Vipassana is now on the ed's radar as well after the ed's inquiry against Vipassana
 poochtacha ke dauraan police ko mili benami sampattiyon, nivesh or karodon rupye ke lenden kii jaankaree pravartan nideshaalay se sanjha kii gai he
 The police has also handed over a hard disk to the ED earlier in which assets worth about Rs 700 crore were disclosed
 ab police ko gurusar modia se bhi bank ke debit or atm card kaa jakhira baraamad hua he jisaki chaanbin kii ja rahi he
 Now the difficulties of people doing business together with Gurmeet Ram Rahim and Honeypreet Insan will also increase
 gauratlab he ki police ko jaanch ke dauraan kai aisi sampattiyon kaa byora mila he jisamen gurmeet ram rahim or haniprit ke alaava darjanon hissedaar hai
 According to documents recovered from Gurusar Modia, Gurmeet Ram Rahim had recently resigned as director of a company
 police ko shaq he ki zyaadaatar companiyon main die gaye logon ke naam or pate farji hai
 If sources are to be believed, Gurmeet Ram Rahim has also invested abroad
 At present, the police is investigating it

 bhaawanaaon or gusse se upar apane ferj ko nibhaane ke liye siarpief jawan duty kar rahe hai
 Talking to 'aaj Tak', the jawan said that duty to us is above all feelings, no matter what we see and feel

 co / sgsk7dbwao - Aaj Tak (@aajtak) February 15, 2019 Another CRPF jawan said that we are angry but duty is the first thing for us
 hamen krodh or bhaawanaaon par niyantran karnaa hoga kyonki hamaare upar jimmedaari he
 He said that we are soldiers and our duty is to protect
 bhale hi ham krodhit hon lekin hamaara kartavya paharaa dena or jimmedaari ek sainik ke liye sabase upar he
 The attack on paramilitary forces in Jammu and Kashmir has hit the moral level of our army somewhere, but nothing could deter them from their duty and responsibility
 ve jaanate hai ki unka kartavya paharaa dena or unki raksha karnaa he or ve dukh ke kshan main bhi krodh or bhaawanaaon ko ek taraf rakhte hue aisa karnaa jari rakhte hai
 The country has determined

 com / 3kpsloan81 - Aaj Tak (@aajtak) February 15, 2019 More than 40 CRPF personnel were martyred in the suicide attack of jaish-e-mohammed in Pulwama on Thursday
 pradhanmantri modi ne ise kaayartapurna krity qaraar diya
 The global community also expressed grief over this attack
 is hamale ke virodh main pakistan ucchayog ke baahar hindu sena or youth congress ke kaaryakarta pradarshan karne pahunche the
 CRPF personnel have been deployed outside the High Commission for protection from protesters
 police vyavastha main jawan sabase nichle paaydaan par hai
 It is a matter of perception
 darasal ise ulat kar dekhie to police kii vyavastha jawan se shuru hoti he
 If we understand this, then Union Minister Kiran Rijiju does not have to delete his tweet
 kam se kam ek mantri ek sipaahi karan ke paksh main khadey ho sakate the
 Because a soldier is weak in front of a lawyer
 vakil ke paas awaz he, pratishtha he, paisa he, pratibha ke pradarshan kaa khulaa avasar he
 The soldier has 100 kinds of restrictions
 naukari kii sharten use bolne nahin deteen
 So it was important that Kiran Rijiju did not delete his tweet and would stand with Constable Karan
 kiran rijiju ne ipies asalam khan ke twit ko ri twit karte hue twit kiya tha jisamen asalam ne us video ko bhi twit kiya tha jisamen ek vakil consteble karan ko maar rahaa he
 Try thinking in simple Hindi
 iske liye aapako naan resident indian hone kii zarurat bhi nahin he
 nris will also see this scene as if the gardens of India have come out
 grih rajya mantri ne jo baat kahi he wo to thik baat thi
 That thing is also commonly said, then why delete it? He is a deputy in the Home Ministry where Sardar Patel first sat
 unke is twit se koun naaraaz hone vaala tha jo dilit kar diya gaya? acchhee baat he ki kiran rijiju ne dobaaraa twit kiya usamen us video ko phir se joda
 The second tweet is that do not take the law in your own hands but let the law do its work
 yah twit kiske bare main he
 Is Rijiju saying that the law is not being allowed to do its work? And who is not allowing the law to do its work? This is not clear from his tweet
 phir kiran rijiju teesraa twit karte hai ki yah kisi samooh ko saport karne kaa sawaal nahin he, bas kanoon apane haath main na len
 Kiran Rijiju is saying something formless or any realization is not clear from the above lines
 kya ve kisi vakil ko kah rahe hai to phir saaf saaf likh sakate the
 When it was felt that he tweeted in support of lawyers, he tweets again
 jab tak mantri ji apane twit ko dilit karne or dobaaraa se twit karne main vyast the, dilli police ke javaanon ke parivaar police mukhyalay ke baahar pahunchane lage the
 After finishing their duties, the soldiers also started coming
 jis video ne in javaanon ko pradarshan ke liye ekajute kiya he us video ko dekhakar vakil ko bhi lagegaa ki jis vakil ne consteble karan par haath uthaaya usne vakeelon kaa cese kamazor kar diya
 In this picture, Constable Karan behaves like a disciplined soldier
 vah maar khaane ke baad bhi gussa nahin karata he
 Karan reached Saket court in connection with his case
 lekin use ye vakil ji maarane lage
 Also hit with an elbow and hit Karan's helmet on his bike
 is puure prakaran main karan ne shanti or saahas kaa pradarshan kiya
 Did not get angry
 jentalman police kaa bartaav rahaa or vakil ekatarfa hamlawar dikhte chale gaye
 To see it was to go through a kind of frustration that hardly any non-resident Indian would understand
 hataasha yah he ki kya is police kaa ikbaal itnaa gir gaya he jo bhi chahega uski vardi oochaal legaa
 There was also frustration with the fact that there is no status of a young person, how much the spirits of those who understand this will increase
 sabhi ko pataa he ki javaanon kaa sanghathan nahin hota he
 Nobody tweets for them
 yah sawaal ek jawan ke atmasamman kaa he
 Today's incident shows how important it is for the soldiers across the country to have a union
 yah zarur he ki ipies sangh ne twit kiya or kaha ki police or vakil ke bich jo ghatana hui he vah durbhagyapurna he
 There is a balanced view of what is in the public
 jin police waalon ke saath apmaan hua he puraa desh unke saath he
 We also criticize anyone who has tried to break the law
 zaahir he yah kaaphi nahin tha
 Within the police personnel, it became clear that the Commissioner of Delhi Police, Amulya Patnaik neither tweets for his police nor goes to see the injured policeman
 phir dilli main jo hua wo news channelon ke daur main to kabhi nahin hua tha
 When it felt that the society was not coming forward for a jawan, then the families and jawans of the jawans came forward
 din bitne ke saath javaanon kaa pradarshan bada hota chalaa gaya
 Banner posters started talking in different ways
 insaaf maangane lage
 These banners in the hands of wives are going to give better respect to the soldiers not only in Delhi but also across the country
 kiran bedi kaa bhi poster lag gaya
 That you are missing
 kiran bedi kaa vakeelon ke saath takaraav hua tha
 With which she became a hero
 aaj wo leftinent governor hai
 How could she tweet
 unka twit nahin aayaa jo ki samajha ja saktaa he
 But it is not good if the jawans of Commissioner Amulya Patnaik remember the retired police officer
 police kii chhavi jaisi bhi ho, yah aadhaar nahin hona chahie
 Then even the image of journalists is not good
 netaaon kii chhavi acchhee nahin he
 This incident cannot be seen on that basis
 police ko laachaar dekhnaa bhi dukhad tha magar is tarah sangathit hokar apane sammaan ke liye ladate dekhnaa sukhad rahaa
 If someone is crying in uniform, then his suffering should be understood
 vah police he lekin ek insaan bhi he
 Therefore crying
 is pradarshan kaa asar hi tha ki consteble karan ke saath hui marpet ke 24 ghante ke baad dilli police ne cese darj kiya
 Against lawyers who beat up
 javaanon ne saamne aakar apni taraf se das maangen rakhin
 They even said that the police engaged in the security of the judges should be removed
 yah koi saamaanya baat nahin thi
 Why did this situation arise that someone had to say this
 yah baat ek tarah se elaan kar rahi he ki state kaa ikbaal samaapt ho chukaa he
 The bond of trust between the state and the citizen has deepened
 ise bharne kii zarurat he
 The demand of Delhi Police personnel is right that they should get the right to form an association
 dilli hi nahin puure desh bhar kii police ko association banane kaa adhikaar milanaa chahie
 When there is an association of IPS, so should the jawan
 dilli police mukhyalay ke bheetar baithkon kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 a meeting was also held with Lieutenant Governor
 pehle kamishnar amuly patnayak ne sambodhit kiya
 The police and their families engaged in the demonstration followed discipline and performed in a peaceful manner
 pehle amuly patnayak ko sunen or phir shaam ko joint seepi ne aakar bataaya ki meeting kaa kya nateeja niklaa
 They will be the best treatment for the injured police
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki pulicekarmi kii shikaayat par vakeelon ke khilaaf karrwai hogi
 FIR has been registered
 kanoon ke mutabik
 On hearing this, the police and the family of the police started shouting slogans of the union
 wo jaananaa chaahate the ki union ke maamle par kya faisla hua
 There was no concrete assurance on this route
 union nahin mila
 Joint CP Devesh Srivastava told him what his rights were
 unke kya forum he
 Another demand of the soldiers was to withdraw the suspension of the 16 policemen who were suspended after the incident of Tis Hazari
 is par joint seepi devesh shrivastav jab bataane lage to naaron kii awaz itani oonchi hone lagi ki unki baat gum hone lagi
 The soldiers remained adamant on withdrawal
 devesh shrivastav kii baaki baaten shor main sunai nahin de sakin
 Meanwhile, the Center sought an explanation from the Delhi High Court as to what was needed to say that there would be no strict action against the lawyers
 ravivaar ko chif justise di en patel or justise si harishankar kii bench ne do varisht police afasaron kaa tabadalaa kar diya tha
 Special Commissioner Sanjay Singh transferred
 adishnal disipi harinder singh kaa tabadalaa kar diya
 Two Assistant Sub Inspectors were suspended
 kisi vakil ke khilaaf karrwai nahin hui
 The lawyers were instructed to provide the best treatment
 kya isse javaanon kaa man chota hua ki unke ilaaj ke liye kuch nahin kaha gaya
 No action was taken against the lawyers
 shaam hote hi dilli police ke jawan india get par jamaa ho gaye
 Elders of the police family were also marching in it
 yahaan par siarpief ko tainaat kiya gaya tha
 It was evening but no solution was found yet
 is ghatana se jawan hi baichaiyn nahin the
 He was not on the road
 dilli ke police ke ipies afasaron kii bhi bechainiyaan badhati ja rahi thim
 His tweets were telling that he was upset with his leadership
 jo seva main hai wo bhi apane javaanon ke liye bolne lage
 It was obvious that he was watching the politics of balance that was becoming one-sided
 ipies madhur verma ne likhaa he ki mujhe maaf karen, ham police hai
 We do not exist
 hamaara parivaar nahin he
 We do not have any human rights
 isi ko ritvit kar asamal khan ne twit kiya ki ham panching bag hai
 i am curious to know which are the senior officers who have met the injured policeman in the hospital
 police kaa manobal dhire dhire girtaa ja rahaa he
 IPS Samyukta tweeted that it is very disturbing
 hamane nishpakshta rakhni chahie lekin jo gunda he use gunda kahana chahie is baar
 IPS d Rupa tweeted that the entire system has been made fun of
 meri kaamana he ki jo log netritv main hai wo sakht karrwai karen varanaa police force kaa manobal tut jayega or gundon ko bal degaa ki wo kanoon ko haath main lete rahen
 The Chief of Police of Andaman and Nicobar has come in black coats, which are demolishing the fabric of Delhi
 inke bich kanoon kaa bhay kaayam karne kii zarurat nahin he
 The Delhi Police needs to take a stand in the case of quarrels between the old lawyers and the police
 arunachal pradesh ke aiji dow sagar prati hooda ne twit kiya ki koi kanoon se upar nahin he
 He who committed hooliganism should be punished
 ipies hooda ne likhaa ki tees hazari kii ghatana ne puure samaaj kii samuhik chetana ko jhakzor diya he
 The time has come that lawyers should also study law
 purv kamishnar niraj kumaar ne twit kiya ki main sahamat hum
 No leader
 koi bhaichara nahin he
 If a member of the team is captured by the goons and no leadership is revealed
 police netritv chipa hua he
 Is embarrassing
 purv dijipi prakaash singh ne twit kiya ki ek desh main jahaan har hafte police ke sipaahi ko maaraa jaataa he, kaha ja saktaa he ki araajaktaa aa gai he
 Is IPS Monica Bhardwaj molested? Monika Bhardwaj has not lodged any complaint on her behalf but an audio has gone viral with her bodyguard saying she tried to save Madam but Madam was surrounded by a mob of lawyers
 gaaliyaan de rahe the
 When he arrived to save Madam, an attempt was made to snatch his service revolver
 agar aisa hua to kya disipi ko exiaar darj nahin karaani chahie, agar ipies afasar nahin bolengi to koun bolegaa
 It should be investigated whether Monika Bhardwaj has been prevented from filing a complaint? Neither the day was passing nor the evening was passing
 javaanon kaa hujum badhata hi ja rahaa tha
 Everything was frozen
 dilli police ke jawan ek taraf duty bhi kar rahe the
 Demonstrations were coming after duty
 javaanon ke andolan ko duusare rajyon ke sanghathanon kaa samarthan milane laga
 IPS Union of Haryana Bihar and Tamil Nadu was supported
 aakhri baar 1967 main dilli police ne itnaa lanbaa pradarshan kiya tha
 About demanding eight hours of home and work for themselves
 halaat saamaanya nahin he
 Lieutenant Governor has said to maintain confidence and senior police officers should meet the injured
 yah aadesh bataata he ki police netritv se baari chook hui he
 It is normal to meet injured policemen
 aakhir police ke afasar kyon nahin gaye
 Do not know how much this matters
 leftinent governor ne shanti or sadbhaav banaae rakhane kii apil kii he
 Today the police was not only demonstrating, but the lawyers were also doing it
 udhar is puure maamle main doosraa paksh vakeelon kaa he jo dilli kii nichali adaalaton main aaj bhi hadtaal par rahe
 They demand that they will not break their strike till strict action is taken against the policemen convicted for the violence
 udhar baar council of india ne shanivaar ko hui ghatana kaa gauge lene ke baad ek bayaan jari kiya jisamen vakeelon se apni hadtaal waapas lene kaa aagrah kiya gaya
 On this issue, some pseudo people are disguising the image of advocacy in the form of angry lawyers
 baar council of india ke chairman manan kumaar mishra ne kaha ki vakeelon kii baar associationon kii dhilaai kii vajah se aise vakeelon ko badhaava mil rahaa he
 He directed the bar associations to identify the perpetrators of the violence and give their names to the Bar Council
 haalanki manan kumaar mishra ne is puure prakaran main dilli police kii bhoomika par gambhir sawaal khadey kiye or kaha ki police mukhyalay par jo dharna pradarshan kiya gaya wo mahaz drama he jisaki aad main doshiyon ko chupaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The Delhi High Court overturned the lower court's verdict in the 5-year-old rape case and released the accused
 2011 ke is maamle main 2013 main nichali adaalat ne aaropee ko 10 saal kii sajaa sunai thi
 The High Court said that the woman was in a 'live in' relationship with the man and several statements in her statement about the alleged incident are 'seriously weak'
 nichali adaalat ne vyakti ko bhartiya dand samhita kii dhaaraon 376 (balaatkaar) or 506 (aapraadhik dhamkee) ke tahat doshi tehraaya tha or 10 saal kii sajaa sunai thi
 The court also imposed a fine of Rs 15,000 on the person
 nyaayamurti pratibha rani ne kaha ki faisle main jinka zikr kiya gaya he, un dastavejon se yah spasht he ki mahila dilli main apane pati se dur akele rah rahi thi or uskaa apilkarta ke saath liv in sambandh tha
 The lower court did not see these documents in the correct scenario
 ucch nyaayalay ne kaha ki maamle ke sambandh main kuch binduon par mahila ne 'jaanboojhkar badlaav' kiye or uski gavaahi se uski baat par vishwaas nahin hota
 According to the police, an FIR was lodged on the basis of the woman's statement
 mahila ne aarope lagaaya tha ki yah ghatana 13 evam 14 janvari, 2011 kii darmiyaani raat ko us samay hui jab vah ghar par akeli thi or apni beti kii maut ke kaaran dukhi thi

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) National General Secretary of Confederation of All India Traders (CAT), Praveen Khandelwal, on Monday strongly criticized Congress President Rahul Gandhi and said that he is talking about abolishing GST when he comes to power
 jabaki unke paas kisi anya vaikalpik kar vyavastha kaa koi blue print nahin he
 Khandelwal strongly opposed this attempt to take his political target by placing a gun on the shoulder of the traders and warned that Gandhi should not do any politics using the shoulder of the traders, otherwise the traders will give a befitting reply to the Congress in the upcoming elections
 khandelwal ne kaha ki rahul gandhi desh ke vyapaariyon ko murkh samajhane kii galati na karen
 Traders know what is good for them and what is bad
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi vyapaariyon ko bataaen ki desh ke vyapaariyon ke liye unke paas kya yojanaayen or kaarykram hai
 Congress had been addressing a business conference held in Delhi, in fact Praveen Khandelwal, who had neglected the traders since independence
 jahaan unhone kaha ki aazaadee ke baad se ab tak desh main sabase zyada shashan congress party ne kiya he, lekin congress ke lambey shasankaal main desh ke vyapaariyon ko kabhi sarkaar ne apni praathamikta par nahin rakhaa or na hi vyapaariyon ke saath nyaay hua
 He asked that Rahul Gandhi tell how many times he met the businessmen's delegation when the Congress was at the center or how many times did the Chief Ministers of the states where the Congress was in the government meet the businessmen
 desh ke 7 karod vyapaaree hue lamaband- ekatarfa karenge matadaanagaamee chunaavon ke sandarbh main khandelwal ne kaha ki desh bhar ke 7 karod se adhik vyapaaree ab ek vot bank main purna rup se tabdeel ho gaye hai
 It is worth noting that two months ago, CAT had launched a national campaign of "one country-one merchant-ten votes" across the country, under which merchant organizations spread across the country have organized more than 500 merchant conferences in the last two months, giving their votes to traders He stressed the importance of and urged them to vote unitedly in the upcoming elections
 yah abhiyaan puure desh main behad safal rahaa or ab desh ke vyapaaree cat ke saath khadey hai or ekajute hokar aanevaale chunaavon main ekatarfa matdaan karenge
 Khandelwal further said that when the country became independent in the year 1947, the number of merchants in the country was about 30 lakhs which has now increased to more than 7 crores
 lagbhag 30 karod log apni aajeevika ke liye vyapaariyon par nirbhar hai
 The country has an annual turnover of about 42 lakh crores, with a growth rate of about 10 percent per annum, it is a matter of great regret that since independence, the Congress Government has never made any effort to develop domestic business in a planned manner and It was always tried that Indian traders should depend on the goods imported from abroad
 yahi kaaran he kii aaj china bharat ke bazaar ke ek bade hisse par apane utpaadon se kabza karne main kaamyaab hua he
 Khandelwal said that traders are very aware of the upcoming elections and soon CAT will declare a national charter and whichever party will give concrete and reasoned talk to implement the national charter of CAT, the businessmen of the country unilaterally in favor of that party Will vote is baar vyapaaree keval vaayadon par bharosa nahin karenge
 The inquiry revealed that the 12th class pass person had no intention of harming anyone
 unhone kaha ki jaanch ke baad kanade ko ghar jane kii anumati di jaaegi
 He said, "we have called her parents and relatives to take her home
" ’’ (from input language) dilli main vidhansabha chunaav paas aate hi aam aadmi aadmi party nechanda jutaney kii muhimatej kar di he
 However, the party chasing a target of 30 crore has received less than expected funds
 lekin kya hogi fund jutaney ke liye party kii ranneeti, aaie aapako bataate hai
 If not received, how will we contest elections! Aam Aadmi Party started a new initiative to contest elections with funds from the public
 saal 2013 main aravind kejariwal ke mukhyamantri banane tak party ko desh se lekar videsh tak acha rujhaan mila
 But from Kejriwal's resignation as the Chief Minister to the year 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party is now around 4
 5 karod rupye chanda hi jamaa kar pai he
 However, the party ran several campaigns for this from the road to social media
 philhal party ke netaa ashutosh kaa maananaa he ki party ko ummid se kam chanda mila he lekin wo is baat ko bhi raajnneetik andaaz dete nazar aae
 He said that the AAP will always have a shortage of funds as we do not take black money, whereas the BJP sheds black money like water in elections
 zaahir he dilli kii phija jald hi chunavi mausam main badalane vaali he, aise main party ne prachaar main tezi laana shuru kar diya he to saath main lunch or dinar party ke zariye jald se jald fund jutaney kii muhim bhi tej kar di he
 The donations collected from the Legislative Assembly will be helped in the promotion of the same candidate
 kejariwal ne kiya tha 10 logon ko nominetaparty 30 karod kaa lakshya paane ke liye kaaphi jaddojahad kar rahi he
 In this connection, Arvind Kejriwal himself included 10 people in the campaign on the lines of # ifundhonestparty, but also nominated 10 people to donate them
 filhal aam aadmi party mumbai main 9 janvari ko ek baar phir dinar party karne ja rahi he, jahaan aravind kejariwal to nahin honge lekin 11 janvari ko bengalooru main hone vaali lunch party wo khud shaamil honge
 1
 mumbai kii dinar party main thali kii keemat 20 hajaar rakhi gai he
 2
 arvind kejariwal kii bajaay is baar somnath bharti, satyendra jain or saurabh bharadwaj mumbai kii dinar party main shaamil honge
 3
 mumbai main tivi kalakaar raghu yah kaarykram host karenge
 4
 jabaki bengalooru main arvind kejariwal party sachiv pankaj gupta ke saath jaaenge
 5
 yahaan lunch party ke baad selfi khinchvaakar bhi fund jutaya jayega
 The Aam Aadmi Party has always been saying that every one of its funds is available on the website, as well as it has been raising questions about it on the opposing parties as well, due to which the AAP had also sent a legal notice to the BJP but now see It would be interesting to see how far the party is able to advance in this battle of donations

 Voting was held in 59 seats in 7 states for the 6th phase of Lok Sabha election (loksabha Election 2019)
 ab aakhri charan ke liye chunaav 19 may ko honge
 But there are reports of rift between the opposition before the election is over
 pashchim bengal kii siem mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee), bispi supremeo mayawati (mayawati) or espi pramukh akhilesh yadav (akhilesh Yadav) voting khatm hone se pehle dilli main hone vaali meeting ko taal sakate hai
 This meeting is to be headed by Congress (congress)
 sutron kaa kahana he, ‘andhra pradesh ke siem chandrababu naidu beete hafte bengal gaye the or unhone mamata banerjee se mulaakaat kii thi
 But when he talked about the meeting, Mamta told him, "there is no need for a meeting until the results are reached on May 23
 mayawati kii taraf se bhi nakaaratmak jawaab hi mila
 "sources say," If the decision comes in favor of the opposition, then a big question will arise for the post of PM
 abhi tak vipaksh ke har netaa ne satarkta ke saath is sawaal ko taala he
 But the desire to become PM is in the mind of both Mayawati and Mamta
 vahiin congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa naam kai netaa pehle hi piem pad ke liye suza chuke hai
 Including DMK chief Stalin
 mayawati or mamata banerjee, congress ke saath bahut najdiki sambandhon ko nazarandaaj kar rahe hai
 While at the national level both are in alliance with the Congress
 mayawati ne to congress ke prati apane paksh ko chupaaya bhi nahin or upi main unase gathbandhan se alag ho gayi or unhone kai baar madhya pradesh main kamalnath sarkaar se haath khinchne kii bhi dhamkee di
 On Saturday, he surrounded the Ashok Gehlot government of Rajasthan over the Alwar gangrape case
 unhone kaha tha, ‘ ham chaahate hai ki supreme court is maamle main congress, police or sthaneey prashasan ke khilaaf karrwai kare or unhen dand de
 'last week, Mayawati also showed her national ambition
 unhone kaha tha, ‘agar sab kuch thik rahaa to unhen shaayad upi ke ambedkarnagar se loksabhaa chunaav ladanaa hoga
 'mamta Banerjee is also an expert player in politics
 vah beete 30 saalon se zyada samay se raajnneeti main sakriy hai
 Although he never openly expressed his desire for the post of PM, but his party leaders have been attacking PM Modi like this
 piem modi ne mamata banerjee par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha, ‘jo bhi 40 seat, 20 seat, 25 seat par lard rahe hai or kehete hai ki ve piem pad ke liye daawa pesh karnaa chaahate hai
 All the gungaroos should be tied and ready
 'vahiin congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne halhi main enditivi ko die intervyuu main mayawati ko rashtriya simbel bataaya tha or kaha tha, ‘main unki izzat karata hum or unase pyaar karata hum or desh ke liye unke yogadan kii izzat karata hum
 Our fight is against political ideology and we will fight for the ideology of Congress
 ' lekin rahul ne abhi tak mamata banerjee ke liye kabhi is tarah kaa bayaan nahin diya
 Taking a dig at Mamta's government, Rahul said that there was no development during Mamata's tenure after which Mamata called him a child
 mamata banerjee telugana ke mukhyamantri ke chandrashekhar raav ke saath bhi sampark main hai jo centre main shashan karne ke liye ek gaiyr-congress, gaiyr-bhaajapa morche ke liye koshish kar rahe hai
 It was clear from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech on Independence Day that the central government is preparing to engage more directly with Jammu and Kashmir politically
 isamen unhone vaada kiya tha ki rajya main lambey vakt se talate aa rahe panchayat chunaav is saal ke aakhir main karwaae jaaenge
 Now making Satyapal Malik the new Governor of the state is a step taken in the same direction
 ve 1967 ke baad pehle siyasatdan hai jo is ohade ko sanbhaalenge
 Malik, 72, is a Jat leader from western Uttar Pradesh who replaced President Ram Nath Kovind as the Governor of Bihar in 2017
 ve 2004 main bhaajapa main shaamil hone se pehle congress or janata dal sahit kai siyaasi partiyon ke saath jude the
 He started his political journey as a socialist student leader and in 1974 he was elected MLA from Baghpat for the first time
 1988 main unhone congress chhod di or purv pradhanmantri ve
 P
 singh kii team main shaamil ho gaye
 a year later, he came to the Lok Sabha after electing from Aligarh
 unhone ve
 P
 singh kii sarkaar main sansadeey maamalon or paryaton mantri ke taur par bhi kaam kiya
 He has no direct association with Kashmir except for a brief stay with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed
 bhaajapa netaaon kaa kahana he ki ve un mutthi bhar bade netaaon main shaamil hai jo aresas kii prishthbhumi se nahin aae hai
 But what made him even more useful was his old association with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval
 bihar main bhi unhone kai maukon par dilli kaa najariya takat ke saath rakhane main khud ko sakasham sabit kiya tha
 BJP insiders say that Malik's appointment in Srinagar has been made to further the party's strategy in the Valley more easily

 com / tv9kytjbgl— Lyca Productions (@lycaproductions) September 11, 2019 Let us know that Rajinikanth is playing the role of police officer after almost 25 years
 unhone aakhri baar 1982 main relies hui film Pandian main police officer kii bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Apart from Rajinikanth and Nayantara, Sunil Shetty, Prateik Babbar, Yogi Babu and other stars are playing the lead characters in the film in the court
 ye film agle saal pongal ke maukey par relies kii jaaegi
 It is worth mentioning that earlier Rajinikanth was seen in the film Petta
 iskaa nirdesan karthik subbaraaj ne kiya tha
 Rajinikanth played the role of a hostel in the film
 navazuddin siddiki ek netaa kii bhoomika main dikhe the
 Actor Vijay Sethupathi played Nawazuddin's son
 film ko box offis par acha rispons mila tha
 Though the thinking may not have changed, the figures are changing
 2011 main rajasthan kaa ling anupaat 1000 ladakon ke mukaable sirf 888 ladakiyon kaa tha
 It has changed in the last 3 years
 aspataal main janme bacchon ke aankade bataate hai ki ab bacchiyon kii sankhya 900 se zyaada ho rahi he
 After surgical strikes on Aman's enemies and black money, the saffron party seems to be in the same mode regarding the UP assembly elections
 haalanki wo yah bhi kehane se nahin sankoch karti ki agar koi unhen damege kar saktaa he to wo he samaajawaadee party
 But the clash that is going on in the family is exactly like Big Boss
 kuch aisi hi baaten upi bijepi ke mahasachiv swatantra dev singh ne kahin
 He does not hesitate to tell the fight between uncle Shivpal and nephew Akhilesh like a film story
 unka saaf kahana he ki samaajawaadee party main is samay jo bhi kuch ho rahaa he uski kahani pehle hi likhi ja chuki he
 Whatever is being done is being done only to strengthen Akhilesh
 jo bhi kuch dramebaaji chali, usase akhilesh kaa kad or badha hi he
 Singh, who is fighting hard to win the BJP in Dhan Tantra, Lathi Tantra and dacoitbundelkhand, says SP has a strong leader
 unke paas dhan tantra he
 
 
 
 or iske alaava lathi tantra bhi he
 However, the money system was destroyed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at 8
15 pm on 8 November
 500 or 1000 ke note band karke unhone dhan ke balboote tantra ko apane vash main karne waalon kii qamar tod di he
 The dacoits are robbing less, their party people recover more
 dhimi ho gai bispi kii speedbijepi agar kisi ko kamatar aank rahi he yaa bole ki ginati main le hi nahin rahi he to wo he bahujan samaaj party
 Swatantra Dev has clearly said that the bsp's speed has slowed down since the bjp's booth conference started
 basapa ke paas kuch he hi nahin
 Those who were there have come with us, swearing that only the lotus will feed in UP
 or jo bachaa khuchaa dam tha wo aath november kii raat chalaa gaya
