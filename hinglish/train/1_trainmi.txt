 It had been nearly a quarter of a year
 darindagi kii koi khabar nahin ai
 So people assumed that Baghdadi died
 or khatm ho gai iesas kii kahani
 But what the world thought was dead
 wo phir laut aayaa or audio tepe jari karke usne kaha
 i am still alive to kya sach membegadadike maare jane kii tamaam khabaren juthi thim
 And he was hiding and preparing for his return
 kyonki kudarat kaa nizaam he
 Dead people do not come back again
 lekin agar sach main aisa ho gaya he to yakeen maniye duniya ke liye acchhee khabar nahin he
 On June 11, 2017, about a quarter of a year ago, Baghdadi was killed in a white phosphorus attack by coalition forces fighting against ISIS with Iraq
 sirian state television ne isaki pushti kii
 But such confirmations of Baghdadi's death had taken place several times
 lihaaza kisi ne yakeen nahin kiya
 Then there was also confirmation from the governments of Iraq and Syria
 magar jab rus ne kaha ki uske hamale main bagdadi maaraa gaya tab duniya ko yakeen karnaa padaa
 22 August 2018 No news came for a quarter of a year, the world assumed that Baghdadi had literally died
 or shaayad uske gurgon ne use rakka main hi dafn kar ke mitti daal di
 And the story of ISIS came to an end
 bagdadi itihaas ban gaya
 But suddenly again a recognized voice came
 ''abhi main zindaa hum''ye awaz ek audio tepe ke zarie ai
 People associated with ISIS are calling it the voice of Baghdadi
 ye bhi daawa kar rahe hai ki duniya jise mara hua samaj rahi he wo phir laut aayaa he
 Those who are not sure, listen to this voice
 toote hue, bikhare hue iesas ko dobaaraa sametane ke liye duniya ke sabase khoonkhaar aatankiabu bakar al bagdadine ek audio sandesh jari kiya he
 In this audio, Baghdadi appealed to his colleagues across the world - "all of you stay united and don't give up because Allah is taking our test
" hamaare samarthakon kii bhay or bhukh se pariksha lee ja rahi he lekin khushkhabari unhen hi milegi jo sabar ke saath iskaa saamana karenge

 ye is baat par nirbhar karata he ki use allaah par kitna bharosa he
 Khalifa will remain with Allah's mercy
 "duniya ko chunautiji, duniya ke saamne ise bagdadi kaa khulaa chalange samajhie
 Because he has appealed to his supporters to fight the enemies
 bagdadi ne america, syria or rus ko bhi chalange kiya he ki ab taiyaar rahen
 Baghdadi terrorists are coming
 aapako bataa den ki bagdadi kaa ye kathith audio sandesh 55 minute kaa he
 This message has been issued by isis's media wing Al Furqan
 ye sandesh syria ke idlib shahar se jari kiya gaya he
 Is the sound in ISIS audio really Baghdadi or someone else's
 ye abhi saaf nahin ho paaya he lekin bataaya ja rahaa he ki aawaaj, bolne ke tareeke or sandesh bagdadi ke pichley sandeshon kii hi tarah hai
 However, suspicion is also being raised that ISIS is trying to revive the organization in the name of Baghdadi
 lekin agar sach main ye bagdadi kii awaz he
 And she is alive

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi is in Bhopal today
 unke swaagat main hordings se puraa shahar pat gaya he
 But amidst all this, the cause of concern for the Congress is the factionalism of their leaders coming to the surface
 abhi tak dabi-chhipi kalah rahul ke swaagat main lage hordings or postaron ke jariye sadak par aa gai he
 Rahul is going to conduct the election campaign in Bhopal
 sutron kii maane to wo modi par jamkar hamalaa bolne vaale hai
 But in the meantime, when Rahul will watch the hoardings carefully, he will be deeply concerned about the state's election results
 darasal, bhopal shahar hordings or postaron se pat gaya he
 It will be a matter of concern for the Congress president that in all these, more scattering than the unity of Congress is visible
 rahul gandhi ke swaagat main airport se lekar biechiel dashahra maidan tak jo hording lage hai usamen koi poster aisa nahin he jisamen pradesh ke sabhi siyaasi netaaon kii tasviren ek saath saajha kii gai hon

 At the same time, Kamal Nath did not put a photo of Jyotiraditya Scindia
 jabaki purv siem digvijay singh adhikansh hording or bannron se gaayab hai
 Factionalism does not stop here purv pradesh adhyaksh arun yadav, netaa pratipaksh ke samarthak bhi apni siyaasi lakeer alag khinche hue hai
 When Rahul Gandhi looks at the road between his convoy and looks closely, he will see this scattering of the party clearly

 However, DMRC contends against this that the NITI Aayog's guidelines will not apply in this case as the Arbitral Award is due on 11 May and it has 90 days to challenge it

 Hindi is our national language, but if students are fined for speaking it in a school, then what a shame it will be
 rajasthan main sriganganagar ke privet skulon main kuch isi tarah se raashtra bhashaa kaa apmaan ho rahaa he
 The matter came to light when the Department of Education investigated it after receiving complaints of increasing fees in private schools
 nirikshan ke dauraan bacchon ne kaha ki agar bhul se bhi wo hindi shabd kaa istemaal kar lete hai to har din paanch se 50 rupee tak jurmaana lagata he
 In Sriganganagar, high-profile schools are looting parents in the name of facility
 kisi skool main hindi bolne par bacchon se jurmaana vasula ja rahaa he to kahin pravesh pariksha or ri-admician ke naam par abhibhavakon se lut machaai ja rahi he
 On the one hand our governments spend crores of rupees every year on the propagation of Hindi, on the other hand, students in the convent schools are facing financial and mental punishment as a punishment for speaking our Hindi
 sriganganagar ke adhiktar convent skulon ne hindi bolne par kuch isi tarah ke niyam-kaayade bana rakhe hai
 If the students studying in these schools are to be believed, if they use the Hindi word by mistake, then a penalty of five to 50 rupees is charged daily
 rajya main nijee skulon kii manamaani par roak lagane ke liye banaai gai rajya stareey fees nirdhaaran cameti ke anusaar nijee skool bhale hi manmarjee se fees nahin badha sakenge
 Despite this, convent schools in Sriganganagar have set their own rules and regulations by defying the rules of the State Level Fee Determination Committee
 fees badhotaree main roak ke baavjood ye skool abhibhavakon se moti rakam vasuul rahe hai
 Most of the convent schools running in the district take entrance exams in the ninth-tenth standard and the cost of the application form is five hundred rupees
 fees dene ke baavjood aath sau rupee bataur pariksha shulk vasula jaataa he
 The income of some big private schools in the city is crores of rupees
 baavjood iske saal dar saal fees badhaai ja rahi he
 Investigating officials, making the district administration aware of the report of the schools, have sent the Director of School Education and the State Level Fee Determination Committee
 jaanch main kai skulon kii report main kai gadabadjhaale ujagar huen he
 These schools unofficially collect children from various items throughout the year
 or usee raashi ko kahin kharch hona bhi nahin dikhaate hai
 The inspection team found that books of private publishers are being taught in classes from 1st to 8th
 har class main ausatan 20 se 22 kitaaben padhai ja rahi hai
 The number of books published by the NCERT is only 2 among the books placed by the school operators
 nijee skool ke sanchaalkon kaa kahana he ki skool dwaara lee jane vaali adhiktam fees 32,650 rupee he
 An investigation conducted by the Department of Education found that children are forced to take books and copies in schools by school operators
 yahi nahin, uniform aadi bhi skulon main or dukaan vishesh se lene ke liye baadhya kiya jaataa he
 However, after the matter was revealed, the investigation report has reached the State Government and the Fee Determination Committee, which is authorized to take action against such schools

 Why no action was taken against those who had accounts in Swiss bank

 inmahawvapurna taarikh-24 oktober Navratri 2019: Today is the third day of Navratri
 navaratri (navratri 2019) ke is khaas tyohaar par maa durga (durga Maa) ke nau roopon kii puja kii jaati he
 In this way, Chandraghanta form of Goddess Durga is worshiped on the third day of Navratri
 maa durga kaa yah rup rakshason kaa vadh karne ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Along with this, the Chandraghanta avatar of Maa Durga was originated to protect religion and eradicate darkness from the world
 navaratri ke is khaas avasar par bhojpuri cinema main bhi is tyohaar kii dhooma machi hui he
 Recently, Bhojpuri cinema veteran Amrapali Dubey (amrapali Dubey) has sung a law song 'law Mai Tod Tod' dedicated to Maa Durga
 bhojpuri actress (bhojpuri Actress) amrapali dube (amrapali Dubey) ne maa durga kaa yah bhakthi geet bhojpuri bhashaa main gaaya he, is gane kamujic ashish verma ne diyaahai
 People are praising this devotional song of Amrapali Dubey and indeed Amrapali Dubey is completely lost in the song
 amrapali dube kaa 'kanoon maai tod da' nirahua intertenment privet limited ke binar tale taiyaar kiya gaya he
 This Goddess song of Durga Maa is so magnificent that anyone listening to it will be absorbed in their devotion
 bataa den ki yah pehali baar nahin he, jab kisi tyohaar par amrapali dube (amrapali Dubey) ne geet gaaya ho
 Earlier Amrapali Dubey also sang many devotional songs on the festival of Shivaratri
 in sabase itar amrapali dube bhojpuri cinema kii queen maani jaati hai
 Apart from his films, his photos and videos also make a big dent on social media
 dilli main bekhauf badmaashon kaa aatank jari he
 This led to fierce firing in Jahangirpuri area in a fight between two groups
 is dauraan vahaan khadey do naaballigon samet teen logon ko goli lag gai
 All the injured have been admitted to the hospital for treatment
 aaropee abhi tak police kii pahunch se baahar hai
 The incident is in the Jahangirpuri area of north-west Delhi
 darasal, vahaan do gut aapas main lard rahe the
 At that time, there was segolibari on both sides
 isi dauraan vahaan khadey hokar jhagada dekh rahe do naaballigon or ek yuvak ko goli ja lagi
 14-year-old Armaan, 15-year-old Rahul and 24-year-old Subodh were injured in the shooting
 in teenon kaa jhagade se koi sambandh nahin tha
 The three injured were immediately admitted to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital in Jahangirpuri
 jahaan se teenon ko alengepi aspataal ke liye rafer kar diya gaya
 At present, the Mahindra Park Police Station is registering a case and is investigating the entire case
 chashmadidon ke mutabikado guton ke bich jhagadaho rahaa tha
 Then started firing from both sides
 or teen log goli lagane se ghayal ho gaye
 But it is not yet known who were the people who were fighting and openly firing
 police jaanch main juty he
 In the political battleground of the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, there is a close fight between the Congress and the BJP
 congress ne bijepi ke sabase bade chehre or satta ke singhaasana par kabiz mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko unke hi 'ghar' main gherne kii ranneeti ke tahat arun yadav ko budhani seat se ummidavaar banaaya he
 In such a situation, it is to be seen whether Shivraj hoists the flag for the fifth time or whether Arun becomes an obstacle in his path? Arun Yadav is the elder son of Subhash Yadav, former Deputy Chief Minister of the state and a strong Congress leader
 subhash yadav 1993 se 2008 tak congress ke tikat par kasaravad ke vidhayak rahe
 Arun Yadav has never been a member of the Legislative Assembly, but has won the Lok Sabha elections twice and has also been a minister in the Manmohan Singh government
 arun 2014 main pradesh congress ke adhyaksh bane the
 In April this year, when he was removed and Kamal Nath was given the command of the state Congress, Gusay Arun Yadav announced that he would not contest the assembly or Lok Sabha elections
 congress unhen unke hi jile khargun se pehle chunaav ladaana chaahati thi, lekin wo raji nahin hue he
 After this, in the last list of Congress, he has been fielded as a candidate from Budhni
 aise main sawaal to yahi he ki yadav chunaav ladane ke liye raji kaise hue
 Then how did he agree to leave his home district Khargone to become the party's candidate from Budhni area of sehore
 aise main wo shivaraj ke garh main kitni badi chunauti sabit honge ye ahm sawaal he
 However, Arjun Arya, who was a Congress ticket from Budhni, is giving Arun Yadav confidence to help in every way possible
 lekin shivaraj ke kile ko bhednaa congress ke liye itnaa bhi aasaan nahin najar aa rahaa he
 In fact, Shivraj, who was beating the Budhni seat for the fifth time in the election field, defeated Congress candidate Mahendra Singh Chauhan in 2013 by nearly 84 thousand votes
 is baar parchaa daakhil karne ke baad unhone kaha tha ki ab wo yahaan nahin aaenge, is seat par aap logon ko vijayshri dilaani he
 Shivraj Singh is confident that more than 2013 bumper votes will win him
 wo is seat par isliye dobaaraa nahin aaenge kyonki unke upar 229 siton kii jimmedaari he
 Shivraj Singh contested the first election from Budhni in 1990
 iske baad 2005 unke liye badlaav lekar aayaa jab unhen madhyapradesh main babulal gaur ko hataakar mukhyamantri banaaya gaya
 After this, in the by-election from his old seat Budhni in 2006, he became a member of the assembly by defeating Rajkumar Patel of Congress by about 36 thousand votes
 iske baad chouhan ne lagaataar 2008 or 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main budhani seat par apana kabja barkaraar rakhaa
 In 2008 he defeated Mahesh Singh Rajput of Congress by 41 thousand votes while in 2013 he defeated Mahendra Singh Chauhan by 84 thousand votes
 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kaa semifinal kaha ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, Congress has fielded veteran leader Arun Yadav against Shivraj
 haalanki arun yadav ke liye ye seat nai he
 Here they have to prepare their own land
 aise main wo shivaraj kii raah main kitne bade roda sabit honge, ye kahana aasaan nahin he
 In fact, Shivraj Singh Chauhan's proximity to many state Congress leaders is well known
 in netaaon par aksar pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se chouhan ko madad pahunchane ke aarope bhi lagate rahe hai
 In such a situation, the question arises that instead of encircling Varun Yadav, there is a suspicion of giving a walk-over instead

 Moody's also reminded the government that it did not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha to pass the bill with important reforms
 vipaksh bhi baadhaaen daalata rahaa he, isliye bade sudhaar vaale bill bhi atak sakate hai
 Anticipating escalating violence, Moody's said, "although Modi has distanced himself from all the statements, the incidents of atrocities on minorities have increased the tension
" hinsa badhane kii ashanka he or rajyasabha main vipaksh kii ore se sarkaar ko kade virodh kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 Ultimately the debate will move away from economic reforms, so Modi must keep his leaders under control

 (from input agency) jawaharlal nehru or edwina mountbeton ek-duusare se prem karte the or sammaan karte the, lekin unka sambandh kabhi jismani nahin rahaa
 Because they never met alone
 bharat ke antim vysarai lord luis mountbeton kii putree ne yah baat kahi
 When Mountbatten was appointed the last Viceroy of India, Pamela Hicks née Mountbatten was around 17 years old
 unhone apni maa edwina eshle or nehru ke bich gahare sambandh viksit hote hue dekha
 Pamela says, she found in Panditji the companionship, spiritual equality and intelligence she had always wanted
 
 
 
 She was the first woman who studied with boys, became MLA, Papela was keen to know more about this relationship
 lekin apni maa ko likhe nehru ke patr padhane ke baad pamela ko ehsaas hua ki vah or meri maa kis kadar ek-duusare se prem karte the or sammaan karte the
 In the book 'daughter of Empire: Life as a Mountbatten', Pamela writes, far from the fact that my mother or Pandit had no time for sex, both rarely being single
 jaane, raashtrapati bhawan se apane saath kya-kya le gaye pranab mukherjeeunke aasapaas hameshaa karmchaaree, police or anya log maujuud hote the
 First published in the UK in 2012, Hashet brought this book to India in the form of paperback
 lord mountbeton ke edisi fredy bernbai etkins ne baad main pamela ko bataaya tha ki nehru or unki maa kaa jivan itnaa saarvajanik tha ki donon ke liye yon sambandh rakhana sambhav hi nahin tha
 Find out how the country's Vice President Pamela also writes that Edwina wanted to present her page ring to Nehru while leaving India
 kitaab ke anusaar, lekin unhen pataa tha ki vah sweekaar nahin karenge
 So he gave the ring to his daughter Indira and said, if he ever gets in financial trouble, sell it for him
 kyonki vah apana sara dhan baantne ke liye prasiddh hai
 At the Mountbatten family's farewell ceremony, Nehru directly addressed Edwina and said, "wherever you have gone, you have raised hope
" china ke kaaran aatanki sanghathan jaish ke mukhiya masood azhar phir se global aatanki ghoshan nahin ho sakaa
 For the fourth time in the hearing of the 1267 Sanctions Committee of the United Nations Security Committee, China did not allow Masood Azhar to be a global terrorist based on technical reasons
 bharat ne chaar baar prayaas kiya magar chaaron baar china ne rasta roak diya
 This time 13 countries had come with India, Sushma Swaraj also went to Beijing, but China did not come under the pressure of public opinion against terrorism and for the fourth time did not allow Masood Azhar to be a global terrorist
 takniki kaarnon se roak laga dene ke kaaran ab agle chah maheene tak is maamle main kuch nahin ho sakegaa
 After that, there may be a further stay for three months
 yani agle 9 maheene main sadsy deshon ko nai jaankariyaan deni hogi taaki takniki roak hataai ja sake or azhar ko phir se global aatanki kii suchi main daalaa ja sake
 13 countries came up with India's proposal
 suraksha parishad ke sadsy america, britain, france or germany ke alaava sanyukt raashtra ke sadsy desh poland, belgium, italy, bangladesh, maldive, bhutan, guyana, japan or austrailia ne saath diya
 China said it needed more time to think properly
 bharat ne apni pratikriya main niraashaa zaahir kii magar china kaa naam nahin liya
 jaish-e-mohammad also claimed responsibility for the Pulwama attack of 14 February
 bharat ne kaha he ki vah aage bhi apane prayaas jari rakhega
 The US has said that it is a failure and will have an impact on regional stability
 10 saal se china ke rukh main koi badlaav nahin aayaa he
 Why he has stood with Pakistan in this matter since 2009 should be understood
 sabase pehle mumbai hamale ke baad bharat sarkaar ne 2009 main jaish ke mukhiya ko global aatanki kii suchi main dalwane kii muhim shuru kii, uske baad 2016, 2017 or ab 2019 main hue prayaas ke ek hi nattejey rahe
 The US even said that the failure to declare Masood Azhar as a global terrorist is against the goal of both the US and China
 magar china par koi asar nahin padaa
 India tried, it did not succeed
 magar pulavama ke baad kii raajnneeti ne ise rang de diya he
 The patron of terrorist Masood Azhar is Pakistan, China has supported Pakistan and Masood Azhar
 to kya bharat china se is aadhaar main apane sambandhon ko paribhaashit karegaa
 Will see their relationship with this matter
 rahul gandhi ne is par ek twit kiya or bijepi ne pratikriya di
 Weak Modi is scared of Xi
 china ne bharat ke khilaaf kaam kiya magar unke munh se ek shabd nahin niklaa
 This is his diplomacy with China
 gujarat main shi ke saath jhulana, dilli main shi ko gale lagaana, china main shi ke saamne sar jhukaana
 The context is that the way the Prime Minister said in rallies that he would enter the house and kill him and bring him out of the seventh Hades
 agar yah gussa or niti aatank ke khilaaf he to yah pakistan ke khilaaf hi kyon he, uskaa samarthan karne vaale china ke saath kyon nahin he
 China has not shown friendship with Pakistan but has supported Masood Azhar
 rahul gandhi ke is twit ke baad bijepi netaa ravishankar prasad ne jawaab diya
 Rahul has been criticized in this statement, but you must have heard that Ravi Shankar Prasad did not use any harsh words about China
 yahi kaha ki china ne puraani niti doharaai he
 Neither said the failure of his government's efforts
 agar suchi main masood azhar kaa naam shaamil ho jaataa tab ravishankar prasad ke kya tark hote
 How then would Prime Minister Modi's speech in his election meetings
 bharat kaa daawa he ki aatank ke sawaal par sari duniya uske saath he, magar kya use yah nahin bataanaa chahie tha ki vah china ke is kadam ko kaise dekhtaa he
 Does India believe that China is not with India on the question of terror
 kam se kam is tarah ke bayaan kii ummid kii ja sakati
 Had Masood Azhar been named in the list today, the TV studio debates would have been adorned for weeks
 to ab in sawaalon par charchaa kyon gum ho gai
 Why is China not being challenged like Pakistan
 ab sari charchaaen waisi kyon ho gai hai jaisi videsh niti se jude masalon par honi chahie
 When Pakistan's name came, it was a challenge, China stood silent with Pakistan
 sarkaar ko chhodie, media kyon sarkaar kii tarah kootnithik ho gaya he
 This is the difference to be understood
 kya news channlo ko china se 
 
 
 
 
 Guess what news channels
 
 
 
 
 ne chup rahane ke liye kaha he
 Fill in the blanks yourself
 hamaare sahyogi susheel mahapatra ne praveen saahani se baat kii
 He has also written a book on China with Ghazala Wahab
 Dragon on our doorstep, managing china through military powermumbai hamale ke baad se bharat masood azhar ko global tebrist kii suchi main dalwane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 Even in 2009, when the UPA government gave all the information, China stopped it on technical grounds
 uske baad modi sarkaar ke samay 3 baar prayaas kiya, china ne roak diya
 Pakistan has 139 terrorist groups on the UN terror list
 agar masood azhar ko sanyukt raashtra kii aatanki suchi main daalaa jaataa to kya fark pad jaataa
 Nirupama Subramaniam has written a long article in response to this question in the Indian Express
 unka kahana he ki suchi main aa jaataa yaa nahin aayaa to donon hi sthiti main bharat ko khaas fark nahin padataa
 India has overheard this matter
 zarur ise kootneeti kamyaabi ke rup main mana jaataa kyonki pradhanmantri modi or bijepi ise chunaavon main bhunaate
 Since 1998, the 1267 proposal was unanimously accepted
 uske baad kai darjan prastaav paas hue hai
 So that terrorist organizations do not get support
 har saal is suchi main nae naam judate hai
 There are 262 terrorists in February 2019
 82 aatanki samooh hai
 More than 100 are from Pakistan
 is suchi main daaud ibrahim bhi he
 There is also Hafiz Saeed who was included in this list after the Mumbai attack
 jise lashkare toyba ke mukhiya kaa bataaya gaya he
 Jaish and Lashkar have been in this list for 20 years
 2008 se jamaat ud daawa bhi he
 This has not affected the activities of these organizations in Pakistan
 unke paas har tarah ke sansaadhan hai jo nahin hone chahie the
 From weapons to everything
 suchi main naam aate hi hafiz said agle din nazarband ho gaya
 After several months when Hafiz Saeed challenged in the Lahore High Court, it was said that the United Nations is prejudiced against Muslim countries
 bharat or america ne saazish kii he
 The UN list does not mean that the person is arrested
 is aadhaar par lahore hoi court main chunauti di
 Lahore High Court released Hafiz Saeed
 said kii raajnneetik party he jisane 2018 main chunaav bhi ladaa tha
 On this basis, Nirupama says in her article that even if Masood Azhar's name comes in the list, it does not matter
 behatar he bharat apni simaaon ko majboot kare taaki aise tatv pravesh na paa saken
 It is true that today the government and BJP would have been taking out the Vijay Yatra and celebrating the festival of festivals, but now when the name has not come, nothing would have been achieved even if it had come, it is being ignored
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke mahatv par sawaal uthaae ja rahe he
 Weren't the questions being raised earlier
 kya vaaki duniya kii raajnneeti sanyukt raashtra se hi tay hoti he
 The intention of political use of foreign policy and the United Nations Council has similar consequences
 kabhi aapke paksh main chizein lagenge magar kabhi kabhi aisa ho jayega ki samaj nahin aayega ki ab kya karen
 Now many people began to boycott Chinese goods on Twitter
 shukr he in logon ne sarkaar ke us hisse kaa bahishkaar nahin kiya he jo china par chup hai
 China is not a challenge unka bahishkaar na karke phuljhadi or pichakaari ke bahishkaar kii morrkhtaa shuru ho gai he
 The hash tag ran on the twitter
 # boycottchineseproducts, teen ghante tak yah number do par trend kar rahaa tha
 i thought that today the Chinese goods of the warehouse will return to Beijing
 aisa kuch nahin hua
 By 6 pm, this trend came to number 4
 congress se bijepi aae tom vadakkam pehle number par trend karne lage
 This will happen if leaders come from Congress
 chini saamaan ke bahishkaar jaisi rashtravaadi apil peeche chali gai
 This insult was not retaliated by anyone
 ramdev ne bhi josh main aakar bahishkaar kar diya
 He wrote that we should boycott political, social and economic of China
 china sirf vyapaar kii bhashaa samajhataa he
 Financial boycott is stronger than war
 yah bahut bada elaan tha
 If Ramdev had become more serious than this, we would have left the election and started boycotting China
 ab kai logon ko laga ki photo khinchane kaa mauka he
 They also started tweeting that as a citizen of India, i will not buy any Chinese product
 kamaal aar khan ne twit kar diya ki yah bhi china ke mobile phone se twit kiya ja rahaa he
 One got excited and said that Prime Minister you should teach China a lesson
 koi raghuveer singh maidan main aa gaye or kaha ki maine apane phone se chini ap dilit kar diya he
 a Ticketock app was deleted
 rashtrawaad kaa isse bada pramaan kya ho saktaa he
 a young man is taking a bullet on the border and there is a young man who is deleting an app from mobile
 ek janaab kud pade ki hamen sirf saamaan kaa bahishkaar karnaa he
 This is a people's issue
 antarrashtriya sandhiyon ke kaaran sarkaar stand nahin le sakati
 It seems that these treaties will not be with Pakistan
 whatsap uniwarsity se videsh niti main export kii degree lekar aae in logon se aap saavdhaan rahen
 He was tweeting with a degree in antiphromatic science
 hamane aapako antair polytical science kii theory samajha di
 China also prevented Masood Azhar from going on the list of global terrorists in 2016 and 2017
 agar usee samay twitor ke ye khalihar rashtravaadi log sakriy rahete to aaj mek in india safal ho gaya hota
 China would have been apologizing to India
 aaj to had tab ho gai jab is khabar ke aane ke kai ghante baad whatsap par china kii pichakaari ke bahishkaar vaala messej nahin aayaa
 That means today i was going to do what's app delete
 phuljhudi or pichakaari na kharid kar china ko to ham sabak siikhaa hi sakate the
 So far there has been no news from any city that a threshing nationalist has thrown out the iphone made in China from the balcony
 log sadakon par apni kaaren chhod gaye hai kyonki unamem china se aaayaatit parts lage the
 Anchor people were also hurt
 chini saamaan ke bahishkaar kaa hashtag likhane lage
 He should have at least checked the Chinese stuff in his studio
 aaj in sabko do kaam karnaa tha
 The first was that all the household goods at OLX should have been auctioned
 taaki ham kah saken ki hamane china ko saste main or wo bhi saream nilaam kar diya
 The second task was to do the government
 in logon ko chini pichakaari dekar, ek baaltee rang dekar doklam bhej dena tha
 By going there, these people would wet the Chinese ammunition with colors with long range atomizer
 chini gola barood mehara jaataa
 That means there was moisture in it
 missile udne se pehle hi murjhaa jaati
 Within two to three weeks, the frenzy created in the channels' studios has turned into a latifa
 twitor ke kisi bhi khalihar rashtravaadi ne chini saamaan ke bahishkaar kaa trend pit jane par naitik zimmedaari nahin lee he
 No one said that the appeal of boycott of Chinese goods had affected the morale of the army
 aise khalihar rashtravaadiyon se saavdhaan rahiye
 You will remember that during the tension with Pakistan, i cautioned that you should trust your patriotism
 channelon kaa koi bharosa nahin
 Now tell me, they are not daring anyone to teach China a lesson
 aapse kah rahe hai ki aap apana saamaan phenk den
 At least give you your own goods
 pulavama ke baad maahaul banane ke liye kai channelon par kavi bulaae gaye
 He started saying a poem against Pakistan with heroic words
 ve sab apana apana pement lekar ja chuke hai
 i appeal to those poets
 ve vir ras vaali kavita china ko lekar bhi likhen
 The channel also should conduct poets conference about China
 kam se kam ham kavita main to china ko lalakaarein
 Anyway, where will she understand Hindi
 beshak ye kavi chahen to china ke saath saath urban naksal tak ko lalakaarein
 Urban Naxals will also leave both Urban and Naxalism due to this new responsibility
 tendulkar se kahen ki team india chini phone kii jersi phenk de
 Give them your channel
 rashtrawaad agar kahin he to channelon main he
 Team India should play wearing a channel cap, not an army cap
 ek bhi match nahin haaregi
 What has deteriorated will never improve

 If you look at the recent track record of Facebook, it has consistently brought many features through Snapchat
 instagram yuj karte hai to aapako Explore feechar ke bare main pataa hi hoga, jise anjaan logon ko explor karne ke makasad se banaaya gaya he
 Since Instagram is Facebook's only company, it would not be surprising if the Rocket tab was introduced with the Explor feature

 In the Goa session of BJP, the announcement of giving any big responsibility to Narendra Modi is just about to happen
 11 saal pehle 2002 main goa main bijepi kaa rashtriya adhiveshan hua tha or usamen gunj thi gujarat ke dangon kii, tab adwani ne bachaai thi narendra modi kii kursi
 Look at the change of time, today BJP is preparing to crown Modi by bypassing Advani
 adwani ke ghar ke saamne jab shor shuru hua to ye saaf ho chukaa tha ki bijepi kii siyasat badal chuki he
 It was clear that the warrior field of Ram's politics has been lost
 har guru kii khwaahish hoti he ki ek din uskaa shishy use maat dekar dikhaae
 But bjp's Dronacharya was immersed in regret at his Lakshgriha
 jo adwani savere goa ke liye ravaanaa hone vaale the unhen sandesh mil chukaa tha ki wo aaen yaa ghar baithen hona vahi he jo tay ho chukaa he
 There was a fierce battle between the two factions of the BJP in Goa, but Advani's messengers understood that the outcome of the fight was already set
 isliye unhone apni bhoomika sirf pratirodh tak samet lee
 By the afternoon, the last message of the BJP national executive sitting in Goa was clear and that message was that the announcement of Narendra Modi's name is now just a formality
 adwani, jaswant yaa uma bharti kii beemaari apane liye kam thi or goa ke liye zyada, lekin goa main baithe bijepi ke doctoron ke liye party kii beemaari zyada ahm thi
 That is why he wrote Modi's name on the leaflet
 adwani or modi ke guton main banty team bijepi ke liye aage kaa rasta chunanaa aasaan nahin he, lekin raajnneeti kii ballebaaji kii is pich par adwani kii ek na chali
 One by one, Advani was out of whack and the modi-rajnath bowlers kept blowing his balls
 adwani ke samarthakon or saathiyon ne rajnath singh ke saath bahut sir khapaaya
 It tried to explain that in this environment, Modi's name will not be announced properly and this will send a wrong message to the workers
 lekin rajnath singh dam sadhakar baithe rahe
 Rajnath spoke a lot through this silence
 adwani kishton main haar rahe the
 Uma Bharti was alarmed by the defeat she was getting
 unhone fouran goa ke liye ek chitthee likhi
 And wrote in this letter that he will accept the decision of the President
 modi ne ye morcha bhi fatah kar liya tha
 By evening, Advani's army had accepted in front of Modi's colleagues that they were now leaving the field
 kuch anushaasan ke naam par or kuch aavashyaktaa ke naam par
 Modi hit the ground on the very first day of the executive
 is nai chaal ke saath hi bijepi kaa cheharaa bhi badal jayega or charitra bhi, lekin satta kaa chamatkaar tabhi hoga jab ye cheharaa sabko saath lekar chalane kaa saahas dikhayega
 But Modi has started the reign of rulership with the old
 kitaab:rajesh khanna: da antold story of indiaj first superstarlekhak:yasir osmanprakaashak:penguin prakashankimat:255 rupirajesh khanna bollywood ke sadabahaar abhinaytaon main gine jate he
 The girls of this hero with breathtaking smiles, playful mischiefs and bright faces were tremendous addicts
 bataane vaale bataate hai ki lokapriyata kaa alam aisa tha ki shahrukh khan kii maujuuda lokapriyata ko paanch guna kar dijie
 Recently, journalist Yasir Usman has written a book on the life of Rajesh Khanna - 'rajesh Khanna: The Untold Story of India's First Superstar
 ' iskaa hindi anuwaad 'kuch to log kahenge' naam se uplabdh he
 It narrates Rajesh Khanna's personal life, his relationship with Dimple Kapadia, and the blurring stardom of his later days through anecdotal and emotional analysis
 'kaaka' ke prashansakon ke liye yah kitaab 'must read' he
 Here are some excerpts from it
 ansh-1: dimple or kaaka main khamoshi kaa rishtastaradam ek mrug-trishna kii tarah tha
 He looked golden, shining, very close, but the more Rajesh Khanna ran after him, the farther he went
 ye daud rajesh khanna ko hataash karti ja rahi thi
 In such circumstances, he used to erect a wall around him
 kisi ko apane qareeb nahin aane dete the
 a famous film journalist close to Dimple, while describing Dimple's condition in those days, wrote, 'dimple's eyes now had a sad desire to wait
 wo chaahati thim ki rajesh khanna unke saath vaqt bitaayen
 If Rajesh was not with them, then the desire to get him kept increasing ’dimple ne ek lanbaa intervyuu dekar apane dil kaa haal sunaaya tha
 Based on this interview, the story of Dimple's day and night passing by in Ashirwad (rajesh Khanna's bungalow) came out, "when Rajesh Khanna returned in the late evening, Dimple's face would smile
 aksar apane master bedroom ke baahar terres par donon saath-saath baithte
 Rajesh Khanna did not know which deep thoughts, used to finish cigarettes one after the other
 aisa lagata tha jaise koi gam unhen khaae ja rahaa he
 After Rajesh Khanna's last journey, photos and fairy tales, Dimple had become Rajesh's wife, but she might not have become an equal partner in this marriage
 pal-pal ginati dimple is ummid main unke saath baithi rahati ki naa jane kab kaaka kuch bol paden
 Maybe they ask her how she is? 
 
 
 unka din kaisaa beetaa? yaa unhen bataaen ki wo khud kis tanaav se guzar rahe hai? koun sa gam unhen andar hi andar khaae ja rahaa he? lekin rajesh kuch nahin bolte
 Just getting lost in deep thought, he would keep on smoking cigarettes
 donon main baaten ab bahut kam hoti thim
 Now a new relationship was formed between them
 
 
 gahari khamoshi kaa rishta
 Finally, putting his cigarette in the ash-tray, he would look towards Dimple
 in palon main dimple kii ummiden bad jaatin ki ab shaayad wo lamhaa aa gaya jab un donon main dil kii koi baat hogi
 Maybe they should say something
 magar rajesh khanna bas itnaa hi poochhate, ‘bacchon ne aaj kya kiya?’aage padhein: jab khud ko deevaaron main kaid kar liya kaaka niansh-2: aatmahatya ke bare main sochane lage the kakarajesh khanna ke dhalate kariyar ke boj tale, unki shaadi pisane lagi thi
 Fights started between the two on these issues
 film magazines main rajesh-dimple kii nijee zindagi ko lekar tarah-tarah kii baaten chap rahi thim
 In a way, his personal relationship was undergoing a media trial
 ek lekh main to ye tak chapa ki rajesh ne dimple kii pitayee tak kar di he
 Such news was putting more pressure on the already entangled rajesh-dipal relationship
 akhirkaar khabar ai ki rajesh khanna ke bartaav se tang aakar, dimple ne aashirwad chhod diya he or apane pita ke ghar chali gai hai
 Dimple told, 'then i made the mistake of going back to my father's house
 maine jate vaqt ye sochaa tak nahin ki wo aakiri jagah he jahaan mujhe janaa chahie tha, khaas taur par us vaqt jab mere or kaaka ke bich bahut zyaada galatchhemiyaan thim
 i took Twinkle with me and refused to even talk with Kaka
 yahi nahin maine to talaaq ke kaagazat bhi taiyaar karvaa liye
 'this issue was well discussed in the media
 kayaas ye bhi lagaae ja rahe the ki dimple filmon main vaapasi karnaa chaahati hai or donon ke bich lagaataar hote jhagadon kii vajah bhi yahi he
 Dimple was at her father's house and Rajesh moved to Kashmir for a month of outdoor shooting
 ek maheene tak dimple is najuk rishte kii ulajhanon main ulajhati raheen, ghutati raheen
 After this Dimple returned in blessing
 unke or rajesh ke rishte main to zyaada kuch nahin badla, lekin is ghatana ke baad dimple ne khud ko badalane or halaat se samjhauta karne kaa faisla kar liya
 The most important thing to solve the confusion of any relationship is to talk, tell your heart
 magar ye rajesh khanna kaa majboot paksh kabhi nahin tha
 Dimple had even removed the news of her relationship with Rajesh Khanna in her interviews
 magar rajesh ne kabhi is tarah khulkar kuch nahin kaha
 Talking about their relationship, after years Rajesh Khanna admitted his mistake that he had pulled a wall around him at that time
 wo dimple ke saath apane man kii koi baat nahin baantate the
 This behavior greatly damaged their relationship
 apane ek intervyuu main unhone bataaya, ‘agar main apane aapako uske (dimple) hawaale kar detaa to wo shaayad sab sambhaal paati
 But i was limited in myself
 14 maheenon ke liye maine apane aas-paas ek diwaar bana lee, logon par vishwaas karnaa chhod diya, nai filmein sin karnaa chhod deen
 Every day my confidence was becoming less and less
 un dinon main lagaataar fikr main duba rahata tha
 
 
 And kept thinking about suicide
 
 
 ’rajesh khanna apane aasapaas ke logon se katate gaye
 If Anju Mahendru could not manage her success, Dimple could not handle her failure
 baad main die intervyuu main dimple nen qabool kiya ki unki shaadi ek swang thi, lekin is baat ko sweekaar karne main unhen kai saal lag gaye
 Perhaps in her heart, she had agreed that she could not be the right wife for Rajesh
 apane isi intervyuu main dimple ne kaha tha, ‘kaaka ko mumtaz se shaadi kerani chahie thi
 She would be the right partner for him
 
 
 ’aage padhein: amitabh ko parde par dekh kya bole rajesh khanniansh-3: or yun kaaka se bade hua amitabh kaa kadanmak haraam wo pehali film thi jisase sahi myne main film industry main shakti santulan rajesh khanna se amitabh bachchan kii taraf sarakane kii shuruyaat hui
 Rajesh Khanna himself thought the same
 saalon baad movie patrika ko die intervyuu main rajesh khanna ne kaha, 'jab maine liberty cinema main namak haraam kaa trol sho dekha, main samaj gaya ki meraa daur ab biit chukaa he
 i told Rishi Da, "here is tomorrow's superstar" but there is a very interesting story related to this era
 jab namak haraam kii shuruyaat hui thi to rajesh khanna super star the or amitabh ek flop actor
 Rajesh Khanna did not have dates for shooting, while Amitabh had time only
 isiilie amitabh ke hisse kii zyaadaatar shooting pehle nipta lee gai
 When the film's rashes were shown to a group of distributors, Amitabh was very much seen in the film at that time and Rajesh Khanna was very less
 distributors ko laga ki film ke hero amitabh bachchan hai or rajesh khanna guest apiyarence kar rahe hai
 He was hesitant to buy flop actor Amitabh's film
 magar rishikesh mukherjee senior filmkaar the or unka trek record acha tha
 So the distributors did not want to directly reject the film
 lihaaza kuch seen dekhakar ek ke baad ek distributors film main kamiyaan nikaalane lage
 Finally, some distributors targeted Amitabh and his' ear-covering hairstyles', saying, 'your hero looks like a monkey
 usase kahie ki kam se kam dhang se bal to katwa le taaki hamen pataa chal sake ki uske kaan hai bhi yaa nahin!' is baat par saare distributors hans pade
 a few months after this incident, Prakash Mehra's Zanjeer was released and Amitabh became the choice of millions of youth as Angry Young Man
 jabaki taqariban isi samay paanch flop filmon kii chot se rajesh khanna kaa staradam achaanak dagamagaa gaya tha
 Shooting was going on at that time of Namak Haram
 safalataa sabakuch badal detii he
 After the success of Zanjeer, the same distributors who mocked Amitabh called and said that the role of Amitabh in the film Namak Haram should be increased
 unhone ye maang bhi kii, ki film ke posters or publicity main amitabh bachchan ko bhi rajesh khanna ke baraabar jagah di jaae
 Amitabh Bachchan was a co-actor at the time of the planning of the film, but the phase had changed by the time of shooting
 namak haraam main amitabh rajesh khanna ke baraabar khadey ho chuke the
 Amitabh's 'ear-covering hairstyle' had now become a fashion statement
 film industry main satta ke is badlaav ke bare main bahut kuch kaha ja chukaa he
 But perhaps the most accurate commentary on Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan's new position was by the barbers of Bombay
 film kii release ke baad bombai ke kai hair-kating saloons ke baahar nayaa board lag chukaa tha
 In this, a new entry was completely telling the new trend of wind in the film industry - Rajesh Khanna hair cut - Rs 2 Amitabh Bachchan hair cut - 3
 50 rupadhansh-3: khun se likhi chitthiyaan aati thimus daur ke gavaah rahe mashhoor script riter saleem khan ne bade darshanik andaaz main mujhe bataaya, ‘ye jo shoharat kii sharaab he, iskaa nasha alag he or bahut gaharaa he
 As fame increases, money also increases, so there is double intoxication
 fans aapako dekhne ke liye pagal ho rahe hai or producers paisa lekar aapke peeche gum rahe hai
 So you are drinking two drinks
 ye cocktail jaisaa he
 If this intoxication becomes more, then any man will stumble
 ’ saleem khan ke mutabik rajesh khanna kii zindagi main bhi achaanak is cocktail kii zyaadati hone lagi thi
 Every film magazine and newspaper published pictures of the superstar's new bungalow
 aashirwad bhi rajesh khanna kii tarah hi mashhoor ho gaya tha
 In a way, it had become a tourist spot in the tourist department of Bombay
 desh bhar se bombai aane vaale logon kii khaas maang rahati ki unhen superstar kaa bangala dikhaaya jaae
 Everyday he would get thousands of such letters of fans, with his name as address, only blessings, written in Bombay
 inamen rajesh khanna kii divaani ladakiyon ke khushbu se mahakate khat bhi hote the, shaadiyon ke prapozal bhi or koon se likhe aise khat bhi the, jinke bare main pehle bhi bahut kuch kaha or likhaa ja chukaa he
 The number of accounts was so high that Rajesh Khanna sorted those accounts and hired a person to answer them
 ye shaks the prashanth kumaar roy
 Prashant became the office secretary of Rajesh Khanna and worked in Ashirwad for almost 20 years
 prashanth ne mujhe bataaya, ‘fain mail kaa dher lag jaataa tha har din
 Kaka ji used to come often and ask that Prashant chose the best menace today
 He read the letter out loud and smiled at us
 wo phans ke jazbaat dekhakar hairaan ho jate the or hansate hue punjabi main kehete- ‘hunn kii karaan? idhar se log
 
 
 People from there, blood give letter
 
 
 main kya karun? i kii ho gaya?’ maine khud dekha he ki har rose 2-3 khat khun se likhe hue bhi hote the
 It was also my responsibility to send Kakaji's autograph pictures in response to the letters
 ’ladakiyon main unki fain folowing kii gavaah raheen ek mashhoor patrkaar ne rajesh khanna ke liye uthe histyria kii tulana jangal kii aag se kii
 Fans' craze for Rajesh surpassed every precedent of previous generations
 raaton main rajesh khanna kaa zikr kiya jaataa, mahilaon kii kiti party main, bujurg auraton ke kirthan main or navayuvatiyon ke sapanom main kisi naa kisi tarah unke hone kaa ahsaas baraabar hota tha
 He went like every thought, every bias, every class
 aage padhein: sharaab or chamachon kii mehfiiansh-4: sharaab or chamachon kii mehfilrajesh khanna itani tezi se upar gaye ki zindagi kii lagaam unhen apane haathon se chhootati mahasoos hone lagi
 The life of a superstar is not only his own, but also to some extent of his fans
 wo super staradam ke gahare nashe kii giraft main bhi aa chuke the
 With time, he befriended the liquor in order to keep pace with it
 kamyaabi kaa ye surur ke saath mahangi sharaab ke nasha ab rajesh kii shaamon kaa saathi banataa ja rahaa tha
 Every evening, the bungalow of Rajesh Khanna was decorated with 'khanna Durbar'
 is darbar main super staradam ke saath unki zindagi main aae ‘nae dost’ or ‘chamache’ baithak jamaate the
 The praise of Rajesh Khanna would start with the sips of alcohol which would go on till late in the night
 yahaan unka har shabd huqm tha or use maananaa unke in ‘chamachon’ kaa farz
 Rajesh could not guess at the time how these people who had taken pride slowly took him away from reality
 lekin unke qareebi log khaas taur se anju sab dekhati thim
 There was also a change in his life
 film industry or media kii nazar main wo sirf super star kii garlfriend thim
 But there was no benefit to Anju's film career
 rajesh apane kariyar or ‘chamachon’ main vyast hue to anju ne bhi doston or partiyon main samay kaatna shuru kar diya
 About that time, Anju later told in an interview, 'he used to accuse me that i do not have time to go to my parties and friends
 lekin jab bhi main unase milane jaati thi, wo apane chamachon se ghire rahete the
 i told them that i want privacy
 kam se kam jab main unase milane aauun us samay to wo apane chamachon ko dur rakhen
 But those spoons always surrounded him
 darasal rajesh ko un logon kii zarurat thi
 
 
 Excerpt 5: Rajesh Khanna wanted to narrate the last story Rajesh Khanna and his astrologer friend Bharat Upamanyu had several talks about the making of a television serial in Delhi before his illness
 is serial kaa vishay bhagwaan krishna ke jivan par aadhaarit tha
 Then Rajesh Khanna became ill and moved to Mumbai where he was undergoing treatment
 is dauraan bhi jab bharat unase milane mumbai jate the to rajesh khanna ke saath is kahani par baatcheet hoti rahati thi
 During one such conversation, Rajesh Khanna was immersed in thinking and then said to Bharat, 'bharat changes the era of this story
 ye aaj ke yug ke krishna kii kahani hogi
 a character who was born by one mother, then brought up by another mother with great love
 usamen tallent or shakti kuta-kootakar bhari he, magar ab kalyug he or jivan main use bade-bade sangharshon se takaraana he
 How does he overcome all these and win
 uskaa jo jeevanayuddh hai, wo kaise jeetta he
 Let's make such a serial
 ’shaayad jane se pehle ye wo aakiri kahani jise rajesh khanna duniya ko sunaanaa chaahate the
 This story was probably very close to his heart
 
 
 jaise unke andar chuphi hui
 
 
 But who during the different incidents of Rajesh Khanna's life was seen peeping out somewhere

 ab betiyon ke liye bhi pehle kariyar par dhyaan diya jaataa he, or uske baad shaadi ke bare main sochaa jaataa he
 Actually, that time has come, when the father himself says, do not marry to get married, only when there is a real desire in mind should one marry
 ji haa, yah salaah bollywood abhinayta anil kapur ne apni betiyon sonam or riya kapur ko di
 He has told his daughters not to get married just because they want to get married or show society
 shaadi jab bhi karo, soch-samajhakar karo or jab tumhen lagane lage ki shaadi tumhen khushi degi, tabhi karo
 The comments anil kapur kaa kahana he ki vah apni betiyon kii shaadi ke bare main zyaada nahin sochate or unhen isaki koi jaldi bhi nahin he
 Yes, they do have some concerns about his career

 (from input language) elister cook ke england ke test captain ke pad se istipha dene ke baad nae captain kii talash shuru ho gai he
 Cook resigned as captain of the Test team on Monday
 is kii puri sambhaavna he ki madhya kram ke ballebaaj jo root ko test captaini saunpi ja sakati he
 Root's claim has also been backed by England's most successful bowler James Anderson
 anderson ne kaha he ki up captain root test captain banane ke sabase yogya khilaadi hai
 The BBC quoted Anderson in the 'tuffers and the Vaughan cricket show' as saying, "root is very quiet but there is a lot of fire in him
" vah pratibhashali or yuva hai
 Significantly, Root has been handling the responsibility of the team's vice-captain since 2015
 unhone 13 disambar 2012 ko test main padaarpan kiya tha
 Since then, no batsman has scored more runs than him in Tests
 root ne is dauraan 4,594 ran banaae hai
 In support of Root, Anderson said, 'those who talk personally know people
 vah jab bhi kuch bolte hai to kaayade kii hi baat bolte hai
 "the right-arm fast bowler said," Root is a strong contender for captaincy
 haalanki yah faisla bada hoga kyonki vah hamaare mukhya khilaadi hai or isliye aap un par dabaav nahin bananaa chahenge
 'anderson said, "when Cook walked off the field for a while, Root assumed responsibility and made changes
 ve is kaam ko behad acchhee tarah se anjaam dete the
 It is difficult for the vice-captain when the captain walks out of the field and has to assume responsibility
 mere or stuart broad ke liye kai baar unke paas janaa or ranneeti ke bare main baat karnaa mushkil hota tha lekin vah ise bade achche se nibhaate the
 '30-year-old Joe Root has so far represented the England team in 54 Tests
 unhone 52
 He has scored 4594 runs at an effective average of 80, with 254 being his highest score
 root ab tak 11 shatak laga chuke hai
 With his off break bowling, he has also taken 15 wickets in the test
 root ke samarthan main anderson ne kaha, ' jo vyaktigat taur par baat kar logon ko jaanate hai
 Whenever he says something, he talks about the law
 ' daaen haath ke is tej gendbaaj ne kaha, ' root captaini ke prabal daavedaar hai
 However, this decision will be big because he is our main player and hence you will not want to put pressure on him
 ' anderson ne kaha, "jab cook kuch der ke liye maidan se chale jate the, root jimmedaari sambhalate the or badlaav karte the
 They used to do this work very well
 up-captain ke liye yah mushkil hota he jab captain maidan se baahar chalaa jaae or use jimmedaari sanbhaalani pade
 It was often difficult for me and Stuart Broad to visit him and talk about strategy, but he played it very well
 ' 30 saal ke jo root ne ab tak 54 test main england team kaa pratinidhitiv kiya he
 He 52
 80 ke prabhavi ausat se 4594 ran banaae hai, jisamen 254 ran unka sarvocch score rahaa he

 purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad desh bhar main sikh virdohi dange hue the, jinamein hajaaron logon kii jaane gai thi
 After 1984 in Delhi, Kanpur had the most horrific riots against Sikhs

 It is believed that in the wake of the Lok Sabha elections, the Yogi government has made stakes to help the Sikhs
 bataa den ki purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad desh bhar main sikh samudaay ke khilaaf dange hue the
 Among them, Uttar Pradesh had the worst riots in Kanpur after Delhi, in which 127 Sikhs were killed
 kanpur main bajariya, nazibabad, pipien market sahit shahar ke kai ilaakon main sikhon ke saath markat hui thi
 In this, shops of Sikhs were looted and their houses set on fire
 kanpur main 300 se zyada sikhon ke maare jane or saikadon ghar tabah hone ke aarope lage the
 However, the Ranganath Mishra Commission investigating the Sikh riots had registered a case of 127 Sikh deaths in the riots
 sikhon kaa kahana he ki ek november ko kanpur main sikhon kaa katleam kiya gaya tha, lekin is maamle main bahut dinon tak koi exiaar darj nahin kii gai
 However, when the FIR was later filed, the case was terminated, saying there was no strong evidence in the status report
 sikhon ne aarope lagaaya tha ki dange main saikadon logon kii maut hui thi, lekin mahaj 127 logon kii hatya kii exiaar darj kiye gaye
 Uttar Pradesh Principal Secretary Home Arvind Kumar said that on the plea of manjit Singh, the Supreme Court had directed the government to set up an SIT to investigate the cases registered during the Sikh riots in Bajaria and Najibabad areas of Kanpur
 isi par upi sarkaar ne esaiti gathan kaa faisla kiya he
 In this case, the SIT 84 constituted by the Yogi government will reconsider the cases of riots in which the final report was put up due to lack of evidence

 com / t4gdxt7kfa You must have heard that the police often use third degree to confess the crime to vicious criminals, but hardly heard of the third degree being given to the ghost, ghost or evil spirit
 hanuman ji ke naam se bhuton ko milti he third digreeyah yah jaanakar aapako or aashcharya hoga ki menhadipur ke balaji mandir main bhoot, pret yaa buree aatma ko kisi vyakti kaa sharir chhodane ke liye di jane vaali yah third degree kisi tarah kaa shaareerik utpeedan na hokar hanuman ji ke naam kaa jayakaara hoti he
 Even after every kind of remedy, when people are defeated, they come to the shelter of Balaji, located in Mehendipur, Rajasthan and it is said that whoever came here and applied for it, he never returned empty handed
 mandir main bajrang bali kii balaroop murti swayambhu he
 There is a very subtle hole in the left side of the chest of this idol, through which the stream of holy water flows continuously
 is jal ko bhaktajan charnamrita ke rup main apane saath le jate hai
 Balaji's temple also has statues of Phantaraj Sarkar and Kotwal Captain Bhairav
 mandir main upree hawa se pareshaan logon kaa ilajmandir main badi sankhya main upree baadha se grasit log ajeebogareeb harakat karte najar aate hai, jise yahaan peshi aana kehete hai
 Balaji can be seen treating these people day and night in the temple premises
 yah puraa drishy itnaa hatprabh karne vaala hota he ki maano kisi mujrim ko third degree di ja rahi ho or vah raham kii bheekh maang rahaa ho
 Many people faint even when they come in muscle
 baba ke chamatkaar ke kai gavahabundelkhand se aae deepak soni ne bataaya ki vah yahaan 25-30 varsho se aa rahe hai
 Deepak said, 'no year has passed, when Baba's miracle was not experienced
 'isi tarah anup modi kehete hai, 'parivaar or mitron se jude kai maamle hai jab dilli kii dawaai haar gai, lekin yahaan aate hi chamatkaarik rup se log thik ho gaye
 'hathipur Balaji Dham is not unique to Prasad in this temple, because like other temples here neither prasad is offered nor devotees can take any kind of prasad at their home
 hajiri yaa darkhwaast lagane ke naam par paanch rupee main milane vaale chote-chote laddu jarur chadaaye jate hai, haalanki koi bhi shraddhalu unhen khud apane haath se kisi murti par nahin chadha saktaa
 There is also a special rule related to the temple that one cannot take any food and drink home with him or her while returning from here
 darbar se jal yaa bhabhuti va koi padhaa hua saamaan le jane kaa hi niyam he
 Actually, neither logic nor science can be used before faith

 Terrorists have now come down to greed to establish fear in the hearts of people
 yahaan par aatankiyon ne duniya ke kukhyat aatanki sanghathan ISIS ke tareekon kaa sahaara lenaa shuru kar diya he
 Until a few years ago, ISIS videos from Syria while publicly strangling and shooting bullets in the head had created quite a sensation
 ab kashmir ke aatanki sanghathan bhi aise hi jaghanya hatyaon kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 The terrorists, while showing medieval barbarity, tortured one young man and slit his throat, while another man tortured and shot him in the head
 kashmiri kaa galaa retajammu-kashmir ke shopiyaan main aatankiyon ne ISIS ke tarj par ek kashmiri naagarik kii galaa ret kar hatya kar di he
 The deceased has been identified as Huzaif Ashraf (19 years), a resident of Manjhagam in Kulgam district
 is maamle main ek police adhikari ne kaha, "aatankwaadiyon ne shanivaar ko shopiyaan jile main aatank kii jaghanya ghatana main ek naagarik kii hatya kar di, aatankiyon ne din main sedpura ilaake main unka apharan kar liya gaya tha
 "the police officer said that Huzaif's body was found from a garden in Harmai village of South Kashmir, whose throat was cut
 police adhikari ke mutabik hujaif ke shav ko uske parivaar ko saunp diya gaya he
 "after this incident, the family of the victim is in a weeping state
 sir main sataakar maari goliyambta den ki aatankiyon ne isse pehle bhi ek shaks kii goli markar hatya kar di thi, or iskaa video soshal media par viral kar diya tha
 To kill this man, the terrorists also adopted the method of ISIS
 is hatya ko glamraise karte hue aatanki sanghathan hijbul mujahidin ne ek video jari kiya he jisamen aatankiyon ko ek yuvak kii hatya karte hue dikhaaya gaya he jise kathith taur par sena kaa mubir bataaya gaya
 In the video that has gone viral on social media, it can be seen that the terrorists are shooting Nadeem Manzoor, and the sanction is suffering
 manjuur kaa shav 16 november ko subah mila tha
 Manjoor, a resident of Safanagari village in South Kashmir's Shopian district, was kidnapped by terrorists on Thursday night
 aatanki sanghathan hijbul ne hatya kii jimmedaari lee he
 Another video made before killing Manzoor shows him in the grip of terrorists, in which he can be heard saying that he had told the army about the presence of terrorists in his village
 hijbul ke commander riyaj niku ne video ke saath ek audio massej bhi jari kiya he
 mehbooba-abdullah said that shameful two former Chief Ministers of Jammu and Kashmir have condemned this shameful incident
 No words enough to condemn the brutal killing of a class XI student at Saidapora Payeen, Shopian
 We as a society need to rise above party affilations to save youngsters from becoming victims of the unending cycle of violence
 — Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti)november 17, 2018purv siem mahabuuba mufti ne kaha he ki is jaghanya hatyaon kii ninda karne ke liye koi shabd puure nahin hai
 Mehbooba said that as a society we have to rise above party ideology to prevent the youth from going into the cycle of violence going on in Kashmir
 Another dastardly killing of a young man, this time the terrorists slit his throat
 This barbarism has no place in our society & no struggle, no matter how lofty the claims to justify it, can condone this inhuman behavior
 # Kashmir— Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah)november 17, 2018vahiin, umr abdulla ne kaha he ki aatankiyon ne phir se ek yuvak kii hatya kar di is baar unhone yuvak kaa galaa kaat daalaa
 This barbarism has no place in our society
 umr ne kaha ki chaahe is hatya ko sahi tehraane ke liye kyon naa koi bhi tark diya ja, lekin is amanviya vyavhaar ko kabhi sahi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 He is your best friend aap usase apane man kii har baat share karti hai
 He stands with you in all your needs
 din kaa zyaadaatar vakt aap usee ke saath ghoomte, baaten karte bitaati hai
 
 
 But you want to keep this relationship only for friendship
 aap use sabase acha dost to maanati hai lekin partner ke taur par nahin dekhti or shaayad yahi vajah he ki aapako hameshaa ye dar laga rahata he ki kahin usne aapako prapoj kar diya to
 
 
 He is your best friend aise main use naa kahkar aap usase apane sambandh nahin kharaab karnaa chahengi lekin aap use partner bhi to nahin bana saktin
 Many girls have this problem
 aise main aap chahen to in tareekon ko apana sakati hai
 This will neither affect your friendship nor will you have to say yes to a forced relationship
 1
 You both spend most of the time together
 aise main aapako ye andaja to ho hi chukaa hoga ki wo aapke liye kya sochataa he
 If you have got indications that he has started treating you more than a friend, then alert him beforehand
 use ye saaf kar den ki aap use lekar aisa kuch bhi nahin sochati hai
 Explain to him that his friendship is very important to you
 2
 There will be every kind of talk between you, but always keep the scope of things limited
 kabhi bhi aisi baaten na karen jisase use koi galat sanket milen
 3
 agar wo aapako prapoj kar de to gussa hone ke bajaay samajhadaari se kaam len
 Deny him with love and try to convince him that his friendship is very important
 naaraazgi main naa kehane ke bajaay pyaar se naa kahen or apni baat samajhaayen
 4
 un palon ko yaad dilaaein jab bataur dost wo aapke saath khadaa tha
 Recalling those moments of friendship will increase your trust in him and he will be able to accept this as your personal choice instead of taking it as an insult
 5
 If they still do not believe, then start ignoring this thing of his
 shaayad ignor hone se use ye samaj aa jaae ki aap use sirf dost maanati hai or kuch nahin

 PM Modi talks about Making India
 skill development par jor dete hai
 His own parliamentary constituency is full of skill, but the skill of the previous governments is ending this skill here
 jab modi ji sarkaar main aae to unki mek in india or skill development par jor detii baaten banaras ke udyogon se jude logon ko badi ummiden dikhaai thim, par bajet main inke liye koi thos upaay na hone kii vajah se ye log behad niraash hai
 You will be surprised to know that Banaras is the only city in the world, where about 60 types of other business of hand work with handicrafts were established in the world, not only in the country, but for centuries, most of these businesses today Either closed or on the verge of closure
 banaras ke lakdi ke khilone kii hi agar ham baat karen to inaki banaavat itani sundar hoti he ki ye aapse baat karte nazar aate hai
 This is the reason that if these toys were used to draw them, they would definitely tell their builder's helplessness
 banaras kii kashmiri gali main lakdi ke khilone ke kai kaarkaane hai jisame har rose lakadiyaan kushal kaarigaron ke haathon se nae-nae akar leti he
 The business was at its peak until some time ago
 inke banaae khilone videshon main niryaat hote the
 Crores were traded, but the government suddenly banned the use of the wood of Koraiya from which these beautiful toys were made
 maje kii baat yah ki is lakdi kaa jiskaa kisi duusari cheez main istemaal bhi nahin hota
 Despite this, it was banned
 lihaaja ab eucalyptus kii lakdi kaa istemaal hone laga jisase khilone se chamak gaayab ho gai
 As a result, the toys that had been giving young children for centuries suddenly started appearing enemies
 is kaarobaar ko modi sarkaar se bahut ummid thi, lekin duusari sarkaron kii tarah yahaan bhi inhen niraashaa hi haath lagi
 Raju, a wooden toy artisan, says with great heart that we had high expectations from the government
 ham logon ko aaj tak koi madad nahin mili
 An NGO was also formed, but to no avail
 aaj tak kuch nahin mila
 We are not teaching our children how many people are leaving work and driving rickshaws
 yah kaam ab khatm hone vaala he
 This disappointment is not only among the wooden artisans, but also in the street of the chhatri bazaar of Banaras while passing through the hammer-clanging voice, the noise of the cow, the Mughal fallacy, the Bengali nakhas, the embroidery work, the pot work, the stool work The story of more than two dozen arts used to narrate, but today there is silence
 yahi haal bunakaron kaa he
 The business of Banarasi sarees is about 1 thousand crores, of which 300 to 400 crores is exported every year
 kabhi ye aankada isse kai guna zyaada tha, kyonki tab isse jude ro material banaras or desh ke kai hisson main hi banataa tha, lekin aaj haalat yah he ki china se yarn aane laga he
 The big irony on this is that the government is levying 25% tax on raw material Chinese yarn, while the finished goods made from the same yarn which are coming from China are only taxing 10%, which will end the industries here
 Used to be
 yahi haul polister , nylon, coton, marsraiced, viscorse jaise desh main banane vaale dhaagon kaa he, jiske karj se bunakar kabhi ubar nahin paata
 He had raised hopes in this budget, but only felt disappointed
 is maayusi ko bunakar asaraf or saafe karte hai, ham logon ko bahut niraashaa hui he
 This budget is for corporate people
 ham bunakaron ke liye kuch nahin kiya he
 Whether it is excise duty, export, no facility
 kul milakar chaahe kaan idhar se pakadiye yaa udhar se bunakar ke liye kuch nahin he
 According to a 2007 survey in Banaras, there were about 5255 small large units
 isamen sari broked zaradozi zari metal gulabi minaakaari, kundankaree, jewelri pathar kii kataai, glass painting, beeds dari, karpet wal hanging, mukut work jaise chote manzole udyog the
 About 20 lakh people used to work in these and this business was worth 7500 crores, but in these 2257 units have been completely closed and the remaining are also on the verge of closure
 yahi vajah he ki mustaa ahamed ansaari jaise logon ko modi ji se bahut ummiden thim, par unhen utani hi badi niraashaa haath lagi

 a post shared by Voompla (@voompla) on Apr 6, 2018 at 11:07pm PDT It seems that Rahul Gandhi is still adamant on his resignation from the position of Congress President, saddened by his party's defeat in the elections
 in panktiyon ke likhe jane tak congress party istife se jude har sawaal ke jawaab main aadhikarik taur par congress kaarysmiti ke ek prastaav kaa hawala bhar de rahi he
 In fact, efforts have been on to convince Rahul Gandhi since his resignation
 rahul gandhi ke istife ke peshkash ko naamanzoor karne ke liye congress kaarysmiti ne ek prastaav paarit kiya he or is par muhar lagane ke liye akhil bhartiya congress samiti (eisisi) kaa ek adhiveshan bulaane kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 The party says that through this conference, Rahul will get a chance to communicate with the workers across the country
 party ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai ki kaarysmiti main paarit prastaavon ko eisisi adhiveshan main paas karnaa jaruri hota he
 He says that in 2004, when the then party president Sonia Gandhi refused to become the Prime Minister, through the AICC conference, she appealed to the workers not to pressure her
 iske baad party main maahaul bhi saamaanya ho gaya tha
 The party hopes that Rahul may also agree to withdraw his resignation after dialogue with workers from across the country
 istife vaale prakaran kii gahamagahami ke bich routine samvaadadaata sammelan main congress pravaktaa pawan kheda rahul ke bare main kuch bhi poochne par kaarysmiti ke us prastaav kii taraf ishaara karte rahe or kehete rahe ki is maamle main yah prastaav hi antim he
 Kheda kept ignoring every question that if the proposal of the working committee is final, then why has the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee and Rajasthan Congress also passed the resolution in this context? In fact, on 29 May, the Delhi Congress led by Sheila Dixit Not only passed the resolution and requested Rahul to withdraw his resignation, but the Congress workers also demonstrated in front of his residence Or
 baad main, dikshit ne congress adhyaksh se milane kii koshish bhi kii par unki mulaakaat mumkin nahin ho pai
 Party sources say that now the Congress committees of other states are also going to pass resolutions on the lines of Rajasthan and Delhi
 bataaya jaataa he rahul kii maa or record 19 saal congress kii adhyaksh rahi sonia gandhi ne kaha he ki rahul kaa istipha gairajaruri he or party main pehle aisa kabhi nahin hua
 When she says 'party', she is of course referring to the party which stood up head-on after her decision to not become Prime Minister in 2004
 tivi par ghante bhar chale siyaasi drame, jisamen renuka choudhary samet kai congressi jaar-jaar rote najar aae the, ke baad pad sanbhaalane kii anichhaa ko jid kii had tak le jane vaali sonia kii chhavi 'tyaag kii devi' ke taur par bana di gai thi
 This time too, when taking the responsibility after narrowing down to just 52 seats, Rahul seems adamant on resigning, perhaps the same circumstances seem to be forming
 sonia ke liye 'party' kaa arth vahi he jo unki saas indira gandhi ne 1969 main takhtapalat ke baad banaai thi
 Through this, he had successfully put forth his claim against the Congress leaders who blamed him for the party's poor performance in several states of the Hindi belt in the 1967 assembly elections and wanted to take over
 unki party congress (aar) thi or unhen apni zyaadaatar party kaa samarthan hasil tha
 Original Congress of earlier
 kamraj or phir morarji desai kii aguai main vipaksh ke saath mil gai thi
 Between 1970 and 1977, Indira appointed three of her loyal warlords as party presidents
 unke ek or vafaadaar ke
 B
 reddy 1977 main party ke adhyaksh chune gaye
 It was a year before Indira herself assumed the party's responsibility
 tab se party kii kaman gandhi parivaar ke haath main hi rahi he, sivaa un saalon ke jab rajeev gandhi kii hatya ke baad sonia ne un par daali gai yah jimmedaari uthaane se inkaar kar diya tha
 Sitaram Kesari, who was the President of the Congress in those years, was removed in 1988 by dishonesty
 saaf he ki do kism ke niyam hai—ek gaiyr-gandhi adhyakshon ke liye or ek parivaar ke liye
 Kesri had to bear the brunt of the party's performance in the 1998 general election
 beshak rajeev gandhi ko aisi kisi ninda-bhartsana kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa, jab loksabhaa main congress ke saansadon kii taadaad 1984 main 414 se ludhakkar 1989 main 197 par aa gai thi
 Under Sonia, the Congress could not win as many seats in 1999 as it had won the previous year (after 1996 there were three general elections in the country) under Kesri, but no one sought Sonia Gandhi's resignation
 is prishthbhumi main rahul ke istife kii peshkash kisi gandhi ke jimmedaari apane sir lene kii pehali koshish he
 But by sinking in Modi's wave, the Congress has become irrelevant
 jin chaar rajyon main congress ne vidhansabha ke chunaav jite the, unamem bhi use apmanjanak haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 His performance was so pathetic that the Congress openly questioned the state leadership
 bhaajapa kii sangathit or rupye-paise se bahut zyada majboot party mashinari or pradhanmantri narendra modi or adhyaksh amit shah kii aguai main daraane vaali takat kaa muqabla karne ke liye congress ko aise netaaon kii jarurat he jo sanghathan kaa dhaancha nae sire se khadaa karne ke liye kadi mehnat karne ko taiyaar hon
 Of course, those who will be tasked to revive the Congress and revive the dull propaganda efforts in many states will need the necessary resources for this task
 kya congress ke paas rokdaa he? kya vah punjab, kerala or tamilnadu main apni kamyaabi ke ishaare samaj sakati he? tamilnadu main shaayad use nae sire se uth khadi hui diemke dam par jeet hasil hui he
 Captain Amarinder Singh has proved to be a steady support in Punjab, but can it be possible that Rahul will hand over his chair to Singh, who has been a critic of his leadership? There are also some young Turks like Sachin Pilot led by Congress Had an impressive victory in the Rajasthan assembly elections
 haalanki payalat ke alaava aisa koi bhi nahin he jiske paas itani rajnatik puunji yaa anubhav ho ki vah adhyakshata sambhaal sake
 The introduction of a person like Pilot or Jyotiraditya Scindia in place of Rahul will create a ruckus in the party and form factions that will start plotting to bring back the Gandhi family
 party ke bheetar in noujvaan netaaon ke majboot pratidwandvi bhi hai: payalat ke khilaaf rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot hai; haryana main randeep singh surajevaala ke khilaaf hooda parivaar he; or sindhiya ke khilaaf kamalnath or digvijay singh donon hai
 The possible outcome of Rahul's exit would be factionalism within the party and then he would not even have someone like Amit Shah who could keep the Congress united and gain the respect of the partymen
 rahul ne congress kaarysmiti se kaha he ki vah nayaa netaa dhund le, par kya vah dhund sakati he? kya vah dhundhna chaahati bhi he? kya party ek aise bhavishya kii kalpana kar sakati he, jab uski patavaar gandhi parivaar ke haathon main na ho?*** The 93-year-old chawl will be redeveloped in Mumbai's Worli area
