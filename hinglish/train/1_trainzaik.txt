king karespondent act kii vajah se yah prakriya ab zyada aasaan ho gai he, lekin bank ab bhi sust gati se kaam kar rahe hai
 Banks should be pressured further
 saath hi mobile phone ke jariye vittiya hastantaran kii zyada sakasham takanic apnaane kaa prayaas kiya jaae (kenya main behad lokapriy em-piiese system kii tarah)
 One year is enough time to rewrite the Right to Education Act
 suraksha ke kuch buniyadi muddon ko chhodkar skulon kaa akalan mukhya rup se isi aadhaar par hona chahie ki bachche sikh rahe hai yaa nahin
 To do this reliably, the process of continuous assessment of studies needs to be resumed, which was abolished under the Right to Education Act
 hamaare yahaan kuposhan kii dar africa ke behad garib deshon ke mukaable doguni he, jabaki ham usase bahut zyada sampann hai
 The biggest reason for this is that the nutrition of children is not in the parents' preferences
 hamen saaf taur par pataa nahin he ki ise dur karne ke liye kya kiya jaae, lekin yadi film or cricket ke bade sitaron ko poshan ke bade sarkari campan kaa hissaa banaaya jaae to isse koi nuksaan nahin hoga
 There are many problems in the healthcare sector too
 nitiyon par hamaari sari bahes sarkari nurson, doctoron or nijee aspataalon ke ird-gird gumti rahati he
 We completely bypass the fact that a large section of healthcare is also outside this world, where the doctors on the roadside shops distribute antibiotics and steroids
 is samasya se nibatane ke liye jaruri he ki ham is vishay par baat karnaa shuru karen
 For this, the government should set up a National Health Commission with extensive public assistance so that the whole system of health services can be revolutionized in order to change it completely
 kehane kaa aashay yah he ki ayog main sirf doctoron kii bhartee na ho kyonki doctoron ko apana ullu bhi to sidhaa karnaa he
 Complete in three years, a lot can be done to improve nutrition by paying attention to nutritional elements
 jaise ki anemia se ladgaye ke liye aayran par vishesh jor diya jaae
 Finding ways to incorporate these nutrients into your traditional diet and making them available on a large scale should be a priority (by doing something like making it part of the school meal or public distribution system)
 is baat ko lekar logon main chetana bad rahi he ki hamaare shahar kis kadar pradooshan ke shikaar hai
 Beijing looks like heaven in front of Delhi
 pradooshan failaane waalon kii nigaraanee honi chahie or unhen dandit kiya janaa chahie
 Drinking clean water and proper sanitation is still a rare thing in poor areas of our cities
 jameen se jude puraane niyam, shahari vikaas kii neeras yojanaayen or sust or kamjor shahari prabandhan iske liye jimmedaar he
 We need to change all this
 samanvit bal vikaas yojana kaa makasad garib bacchon ko aage badaae kaa buniyadi aadhaar muhaiyaa karana tha
 But this scheme is working so poorly that most parents leave it in the middle
 is yojana par ek baar phir se vichaar karne or phir se iskaa swaroop tay karne kii jarurat he
 Complete in five years It is prudent to set some goals with a time limit of five years
 is disha main kai moolbhoot binduon par vichaar kiya ja chukaa he, lekin abhi or mahatvapurn sawaalon ko khoje jane kii jarurat he
 Our goal in the field of education should be that more than 50 per cent of the children of primary education attain education and solve mathematics questions of their level
 aarthik madad ke liye universal transfar kaarykram hona chahie, jisamen shahari or gramin sabhi naagarik shaamil hon
 In the process of providing this cooperation, we will have global access to bank accounts, where people will be able to secure their funds
 bal kuposhan ke maamle main hamaara lakshya gambhir kuposhan ke maamalon kii dar ko aadha karnaa he
 Approximately one-third of cases of severe anemia in relation to adults are to be reduced
 shaharon main hamaara lakshya yah hona chahie ki jin logon tak pine kaa saaf pani or safai vyavastha nahin pahunch paa rahi he, unki sankhya main ek-tihaai kii kami aae
 Our goal should be to reduce the rate of pollutants present in the air to below 60 micrograms per cubic meter
 swasthya seva ke kshetra main anumaanit lakshya bahut aasaan he‚Äîaagaamee paanch saal main shishu or matra mrityu dar main ek-chauthai kii kami
 The larger goal is a bit complex and it is difficult to determine its form and extent: for example, to rationalize and justify our healthcare system
 sarkari tantra main badi sankhya main maujuud doctoron or nurson kaa behatar istemaal karnaa, jo tankhwaah lene ke alaava bahut kam kaam karte hai
 The quacks and spiritual healers should be united so that they can be better trained and regulated
 inamen se koi kaam aasaan nahin he
 Some are difficult to the extent of impossible, but we want to be proud of our country
 (lekhak emity, america main iconomics ke ford foundation international professor hai) Some people think of themselves as too smart, but sometimes they are overshadowed by this cleverness
 ham 21veen sadi main ji rahe hai or ab purushpradhan soch kaa bolbalaa nahin rahaa he
 But even today some people are left of this species who have a conservative view of girls
 is shaks ke bare main jaanakar to yahi lagata he ki duniya main ladakiyon ke bare main parpanrik soch abhi bhi peeche nahin chhuti he
 The man took a test of his girlfriend and tried to find out whether she was a marriage material or not
 vah yah jaananaa chahta tha ki uski garlfriend shaadi ke rishte ke liye feet baithti he yaa nahin
 He called his girlfriend to his dirty and cluttered room to take this test
 usne sochaa tha ki agar uski garlfriend ghar main ghuste hi safai shuru kar degi to vah uski bivi banane ke laayak he
 Unfortunately, this girl made no effort to clean the house
 vah uske ghar ai, khaanaa khaaya or agle din chali gai
 But the process of this man's stupidity did not end here
 usne apana anubhav twitor par bhi share kar diya
 She wrote, 'I called my girlfriend at my house for the first time and to be honest i was very disappointed
 vah subah ai thi or bina bartan saaf kiye chali gai
 i thought that she is marriage material but she completely failed in this girlfriend test
 'I invited my girlfriend for the first time ever at my place & i was extremely disappointed to be honest, she came this morning & left without even washing dishes let alone some cleaning
 i thought this was actually wife material but she completely failed this girlfriending testpic

 Salman Khan gave a break to Himesh Reshammiya
 himesh ne bhi kai baar salmaan khan ko is baat kaa credit diya he
 Now Himesh spoke about one of Salman's questions in Mindrox 2019, which changed his life
 salmaan ke kis sawaal ne himesh ko banaaya superstar?salmaan ke bare main baat karte hue himeshne kaha- 'main 13 saal kaa tha
 i sang Salman's songs
 mujhe salmaan bhai ne jo brake diya
 i got success after that
 lekin unhone kaha tha ki 5-6 saxes gaanen to koi bhi de saktaa he
 But how will you make a place in the industry
 ye baat mujhe chalengig lagi
 "I sang 350 new songs at that time, got everyone tested
 maine mekars ko 350 gaanon kaa opshan diya
 i forced the makers to give me brakes except for the big composer
 maine 1 gane kii jagah 350 gane sunaae
 To get to the floor, parents' trust, hard work, trust in luck, good intentions and attitude are necessary
 maine stock main gane banaae
 'big Godfather or Big Chance, what do you think Himesh? Big Godfather or Big Chance? On this question, Himesh said- First of all, luck happens
 lekin aapako jindagi main ek mauka jarur milegaa jab aap apni manzil ke bahut kareeb honge
 'take a time of four years, if a man starts his career, he will definitely get a chance somewhere
 to koi bolegaa ki do minute main kuch suna den, agar mujhe acha lag gaya to main use le luungaa
 But in those two minutes you should have content that no one in the industry has
 aapaki taiyaari agar majboot nahin he to un chaar saal main jo do minute aapako mili hai wo miss ho jaaenge
 Then you have to wait four years
 apane free time kaa istamaal kariye
 i got Salman brother, you will definitely get someone else
 bas aap apni taiyaari puri rakhie

 His previous film Love in Paris did not do well at the box office

 Regarding these claims, CBEC has decided to investigate all claims of more than one crore rupees
 1 july se lagu hui jiesti vyavastha ke tahat companiyon ko puraani vyavastha ke antargat kiye gaye stock kii kharid par chukaaye gaye kar ke credit kaa daawa karne kii suvidha di gai he

 Along with filing their first GST return in July, companies had also filed a Tran-1 form to claim the arrears

 In view of the huge claims, board member Mahendra Singh had said in the letter that the dues of the transition period of the GST regime will be paid only if it is valid under the law
 sibiisi ne kaha ki galati se yaa galatfahami main ayogy bakaayaa daawey kiye jane kii sambhaavna ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Credit claims above Rs 1 crore should be investigated within the stipulated time frame
 board ne mukhya ayuktaon ko kaha he ki in 162 companiyon ke daavon par 20 sitambar tak ek report den
 CBEC has asked field officers to ensure that only eligible claims under the GST system are carried forward, to match the newly filed returns with the returns filed under the old system

 i do not consider it a matter of concern
 ‚Äô unhone sweekaar kiya ki team main kai star khilaadiyon ke hone ke kaaran antim ekadash kaa chayan thodaa saradard bharaa hoga

 ‚Äô In Dimapur, a man was beaten to death by a mob
 ab grih mantralay ko lag rahaa he ki iskaa asar desh ke baaki shaharon main hoga

 Holi is considered a major festival in Hinduism
 deshbhar main log ise dhooma-dham se manaate hai or jamkar rangon se khelte hai
 During this time, they do not even care about their body and skin
 rangon main artificial chemicals hote hai
 The skin of a person is very delicate and can also be spoiled by exposure to colors
 isliye rangon se khelte vakt kaaphi saavdhaanee baratane kii jarurat he
 If these five tips are adopted then Holi will play fiercely and there will be no problem
 1- agar aapaki twachaa rukhi ke saath rangon se nahin khelnaa chahie
 Before playing Holi, if you massage coconut oil thoroughly throughout your body, then it will be of great benefit
 iske alaava baalo main sarson kaa tel lagaana bhi jaruri he taaki baad main nahaate samay rangon ko aaraam se chhudaaya ja sake
 2- If you play Holi in the sun for a long time, never forget to apply sunscreen
 iske alaava aap apane nakhun main gadhe rang kii nelpaint bhi laga sakate hai
 It has often been seen that once the color is applied in the nail, it becomes very difficult to get rid of it
 barsaanaa main latoomaar holi aaj, upi CM yogi pahunche mathura3- iske alaava ankhon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhane kii khaas aavashyaktaa he
 Our eyes are very sensitive and they can suffer damage due to chemicals in color
 is dauraan ham ankhon main agar sanglases laga ke rakhen to ham ankhon ko nuksaan pahunchane se bachaa sakate hai
 4- If you get injured while playing Holi and get hurt anywhere in the body, then it would be a foolish decision to ignore it
 turant us jagah par aapako antibecterial loshan lagane kii or use band-aid se dhakne kii jarurat he
 India is not celebrated here, the world's biggest holi! 5- Chemicals are mixed in huge quantities in colors
 isamen ye pataa laga paanaa bahut mushkil hota he ki koun sa rang sahi he
 In this connection, it will be necessary that you use herbal colors, or if possible, make your own colors at home
 iske atirikt ye dhyaan dene kii bhi jarurat he ki zyada der tak geele kapadon main naa rahen or samay-samay par apana haath dhote rahen

 JDU MP Harivansh and actor Shekhar Suman in Rajya Sabha advocated the change of Bihar in 'panchayat Aaj Tak'
 shekhar suman ne kaha ki raajnneetik ichha shakti kii kami kaa hamaare samaaj main bura asar pad rahaa he
 At the same time, Harivansh raised questions on Bihar being ignored
 harivansh:bihar main pichley kuch varshon main lau and order dikhaai diya he
 It is not just limited to crime
 gaanv or block str tak prashasan main sudhaar hua he
 Development of institutions and institutions
 samaaj ke har tabake ko saath lekar aage badhanaa
 The cycle planning effort was successful and its impact will be seen in the times ahead
 ye buniyadi chijen hai
 Bihar is growing on the path of development
 ek vakt tha rajkpur jab ko bihar aana padaa
 Today, migration is a big problem
 gadabadi kahaan haishekhar suman:political vil kii kami rahati he to iskaa asar samaaj par bhi padataa he
 We spend a lot of time in debate and discussion
 shuruyaat dhimi gati se hoti he
 We keep arguing about development and change and after a time no one wants to listen to it
 political vil or political vijandonon kii kami iske liye kaaran he
 Infrastructure matters a lot
 yahaan tak ki airport par jab plane techoff kar rahaa hota he to chaar kute uske saath res laga rahe hote hai
 So many instructions come
 itane bade shahar main ek five star hotel nahin he
 These are superficial things
 lekin baahar se koi aata he to asar karti hai
 What was the situation that the minimum requirements in the state could not be met? The public is angry with the leaders that nothing is happening
 shekhar:gussa hameshaa rahegaa
 Because the promises that are made are not fulfilled
 netaa ham karenge ki jagah ham ne kiya kyon nahin kehete
 Why does the tap come at one time and water at other times
 ek hi baar main nal ke saath pani kii vyavastha kyon nahin hoti
 It is a crab situation that it is her habit to bite
 kehane se kuch nahin hota
 When i come down to Bihar, i am told that the election here is a principled fight
 lekin mujhe to lagata he ki yahaan poster kii ladaai he
 My biggest poster
 jumale kii ninda hoti he or jawaab main jumala hi pesh kiya jaataa he
 Lack of political will is directly responsible for this
 pani kii vyavastha nahin, sadak nahin, khet ke raste sab chal rahe hai
 It is not that it cannot happen, if you think it can happen
 raajnneetik vikalp nikal kar nahin aayaa
 Harivansh: Today it has come that Gujarat is the best to do business
 lekin vahaan kya kuch hua he yah kisi se chipa nahin
 Actually, Bihar was negated
 jaanboojhkar bihar ke saath discrimination hua
 Woke up in Bihar 1974, he dreamed
 beete varshon main bihar main koshish ye hui ki maanav shram par kharch ho
 His economic progress in Bihar has shown that he is in the forefront and he should get his right
 desh main jo iconomic model he, usase ham kahaan ja rahaa he
 Bihar is still agro-based
 rajya abhi bhi nunatam kii ladaai lard rahaa he
 Harivansh: Nitish Kumar's agricultural roadmap is an attempt in this direction
 aap dekhenge ki im kii padhai ke baad ladke aakar rajya main krishi ke kshetra main kaam kar rahe hai
 i cannot tell what will be the alternative model of the crisis of capitalism
 bollywood ho yaa jarnalism har jagah bihar ke log hai
 So that is why people are not coming
 shekhar:jab raajnneetik mahaul sahi nahin hoga, kuch hoga nahin
 We proudly say that IAS, officers, teachers are all Bihari, but the condition of Bihar is poor
 kaaran yah he ki bihar main maahaul sahi nahin he
 The facilities are not there
 kaaran he ki sankeern raajnneeti yahaan chalati rahi he
 The state cannot think of rising above caste
 raajnneetik log mahaul bana nahin paa rahe
 Until the people of politics show the right path, how will people follow it? skool kaa principal acha ho tabhi vidhyaarthee achche niklenge
 Political will is needed
 aap dekhenge ki jaise desh arthvyavastha main majboot ho rahaa he
 People's faith is awakened, Indians who have settled abroad are returning to India
 aisa hi bihar ke saath hi hoga, agar vikaas ho
 But obviously some people do not want this to happen and their politics continues
 gujarat main dange hue, maharashtra main dange hue
 This did not happen in Bihar, but there is some reason that is stopping the new Bihar
 harivansh:aap dekhie ki munashya main apaar sambhaavnaae hai
 Jayaprakash Narayan used to study in Chicago
 unhen badi naukari mil sakati thi
 But he started a new tradition outside politics and tried to awaken the society
 unhone logon main mahaul banaaya or aasthaa jagaai
 i hope someone like that will be born in Bihar
 mujhe ummid he ki jo bihar ke log baahar hai wo aaenge or ummid jagaayenge
 Suman: Much is said about the back
 un logon ke naam liye jate hai jinhone bihar ke vikaas main yogadan diya
 But no one speaks what to do next
 aage kii baaten kyon nahin karte? bachapan kii yaade hai
 Holi used to celebrate Diwali
 yahaan kii jitani bhi sansthaaen jaani maani thim
 Last Holi i came, saw only two or four people are left here
 main yahaan aata rahoonga
 i can support the social revolution here
 yah meri soch he
 She will come in the morning
 ham negative ho jaaen, aisa nahin hoga
 Harivansh: i deliberately talk about the past
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main british log churchill kii ore dekhe

 Today, one who talks to children on values also talks about technology
 shekhar suman ne ant main kaha, ‚Äòsahi party ko sarkaar main laana bahut jaruri he
 Who was with whom, married whom
 gathbandhan main kabhi kabhi ganth bhi lag jaati he
 If you are not able to do it, then sometimes let others do it
 ghar main bawarchi bahut sahi he lekin khaanaa ek hi tarah kaa banaata he to aap usase kuch alag banane kahenge
 Give a chance for change

 Excerpts from a special conversation with Anand l Roy, the director of this film, which managed to win the hearts of audiences and critics
 Here are some excerpts: Is your film being appreciated everywhere? Thank you, thank you very much i am very happy is film kii niv kaise rakhi aapane?kahani, kahani se badhkar kuch nahin he, jab'tanu vaids manu'khatm hui thi tab iskaa beej aa chukaa tha

 main asal main film kaa sikval nahin bananaa chaah rahaa tha isliye maine ek tarah se actors or khud ko 4 saal kaa gap dena sahi samajha
 Did you think of 'tanu Weds Manu Returns' when you were making 'ranjhana'? Yes of course i did not know how and when it would come but before Ranjhana there was so much drama that 'tanu Weds Manu Returns' will be made
 
 ranjhna ke thik baad ham logon ne nirnay liya kii ab sahi vakt he kahani sunaane kaa
 How was it difficult or easy to present Kangana in a double role? It was not easy to say difficult, but it is fun
 maine kabhi bhi aasaan filmein nahin bananaa chaha isliye mujhe mushkil kaamon main hi majaa aata he
 Kangana has a long dialogue in Haryanvi language during the character of Datto, how many tax did he take for it? i did not count any tax, i do not count anyway, it is very interesting to remove another character from an actor
 isliye us samay dhyaan tex ginaney par nahin rahata bas itnaa pataa tha ki kuch behtareen mila he
 Tell us the experience of different shooting locations? The story of the film took us to many locations
 mere liye lokation bahut ahm hai

 Hindustan is seen breathing in the film

 What is the squeeze of this film? Basic human nature is, the only reason for telling the story is that it is good to have a shortcoming in yourself, mistakes must be made that take you forward
 lav story ke aasapaas kii chijen bhi kaaphi ahmiyat rakhti hai
 How do you take success and failure? What i am happy with comes from both, for me there is a difference between success and achievement and i only see achievement
 jisase mujhe khushi milti he
 Ever wanted to make a biopic? The only problem is that what he has seen does not feel like making, especially when he has liked it, then when i have fun in a story, i do not want to recreate it
 khabar he kii aap apane riter himanshu sharma ko chupa ke rakhte hai ?(hansate hue) are nahin chupa ke kya rakhuunga
 He is a very good writer and human being and has a distinct identity of his own
 kam umr main vah bahut kuch likh daalate hai
 i have a very good future, i hope he will direct films too
 kabhi darshakon ko kuch anokhaa dene kaa dabaav hota he?nahin, main bas kahani sunaanaa chahta hum
 i will always tell the story from the heart, i like to represent myself as a storyteller and not as a director
 aane vaale kya projects hai?mere liye abhi kuch bhi nahin he jahan main haalanki 2-3 kahania hai
 Are you going to do a film with Dhanush? Dhanush is a favorite actor and younger brother of mine and has his own future

 Team India is the defending champion and this time the responsibility of saving the title rests on his 'weak' shoulders
 yahaan kamjor shabd kaa istemaal isliye kiya gaya he kyonki team kii maujuuda haalat dekhakar kahin se nahin lag rahaa he ki ham world cap khitaab kii raksha kar paaenge
 These are five such things, which it seems that Team India will not be able to save the World Cup title
 world cap to team india hi jeetegi, ye raheen 5 vajah1
 All is not well in the team! The biggest difficulty of Team India is that the dressing room environment is disturbed
the unrest in Team India's dressing room was revealed australia ke khilaaf haal main khatm hui test siries main team india ke dressing room kii ashaanti sabake saamne ai thi
 In the Brisbane Test, Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan both had a debate on the batting position and the team had to pay the loss after losing the match
 match ke baad captain kool dhoni ne bhi kaha ki dressing room main maahaul kuch bigadaa hua tha
 After this, after the third Test of the series, MS Dhoni suddenly said goodbye to Test cricket
 khabaren ai ki viraat kohli or team diarector ravi shastri ke bich badhati nazdikiyon kii vajah se dhoni ne sanyas liya
 In the last Test match, Shikhar Dhawan was dropped from the playing XI as soon as he became captain
 haalanki dhawan ke baahar karne ke peeche unki kharaab form bhi ek vajah thi lekin khabaren ai ki donon khilaadiyon ke bich abhi bhi sabakuch thik nahin ho paaya he
 After this, during the TRAI series, Virat Kohli did something on Twitter that the distance between him and Dhoni was exposed
 viraat ne ek aisi news report ko retweet kiya jisamen dhoni ko spot phixing main lipt bataaya gaya
 Now within two months, so much news cannot be rumored, so it would not be wrong to say that everything in the team is not well
 2
 Bad condition of batsmen
 
 
 team india kii sabase badi takat hi is samay out of form he
 No batsman of Team India is in such a form that it can be assured that his brother will get the match out
 test siries main viraat kohli kaa balla aag kii tarah ran ugal rahaa tha lekin maujuuda vanade tri siries main wo bhi shant ho gaya he
 Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Captain Dhoni himself, Virat, Shikhar Dhawan are all bad
 dhawan kii baat karen to aisa lag rahaa he ki apni sasuraal pahunchakar wo ran bananaa hi bhul gaye hai
 Of all these batsmen, no one is playing in such a way that they can be trusted by closing their eyes
 in sabake bich suresh raina bhi form se milon dur hai or rabindra jadeja kandhe kii injuri ke baad kaaphi lambey samay tak team se baahar rahane ke baad vaapasi karenge
 3
 gendbaajon se uth chukaa he bharosagendbaaji kabhi bhi team india kaa majboot paksh nahin rahaa he, philhal haalat or bhi buree ho gai he
 The way everyone has been beaten in the TRAI series and the Test series, it is impossible to get any total defense from Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, r Ashwin, Umesh Yadav
 gendbaaji ke maujuuda halaat to aise hai ki agar team ne 400 ran bhi bana liye to use dephend kar paanaa inke bas main nahin hoga
 Ishant Sharma has recovered from injury but his form is not such that it can be trusted
 akshar patel ne prabhavit jarur kiya he lekin world cap main kitna kaamyaab ho sakenge ye to aane vaala vakt hi batayega
 4
 phuss he fielding bhitim main viraat kohli, suresh raina, rabindra jadeja, ajinkya rahane jaise chust fielder maujuud hai lekin philhal team kii fielding bhi phuss najar aa rahi he
 In the tri-series, Virat did a lot of diving on the boundary line but failed on several important occasions to save the fours
 shikhar dhawan kii ballebaaji form ke saath fielding bhi kaaphi kharaab hui he
 Team India do not have very good fielders to save runs and catch catches on the field
 5
 In the finals of the 2011 World Cup, Dhoni's six in the final match of 'team India' and 'chaupat' Raja does not forget the bold decision of handing the last over to Joginder Sharma in the final of 2007 T20 World Cup
 yaad kariye aapane aakhri baar dhoni ko kisi match main finishr kii bhoomika nibhaate hue kab dekha tha? lambey samay se dhoni kaa helicopter shot bhi nahin dekhne ko mila he
 Team India is stacked on one side and Dhoni's decisions on the other side are proving to be flat
 dhoni kaa midas tach khatm hota najar aa rahaa he

 reliance dephence kaa kahana he ki videshi vendorus ke bhartiya parteners ke chayan main raksha mantralay kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 Since 2005, 50 offset contracts have been signed so far the same procedure has been adopted
 reliance dephence ne iske jawaab main kaha he ki is sawaal kaa jawaab raksha mantralay hi sabase sahi de saktaa he
 But it is better to understand that according to DPP-2016, foreign vendors have the option of electing to provide details of their offset partners at the time of claiming offset credits
 is maamle main ofaset obligations sitambar 2019 ke baad hi du hongi
 It is therefore possible that the Ministry of Defense has not received any formal information from Dassault about its offset partners
 tippaniyan What kind of a deal is this that from April 2015 to August 2018 has not yet been known to the Ministry of Defense, Dasso Aviation has not given any information, after this reply of Reliance, at least the Ministry of Defense should reply
 ab ek sawaal ke jawaab main reliance dephence kahati he ki use 30,000 karod kaa theka nahin mila he
 How much work will be given to DSO Aviation to which offset partner, it has not been decided yet
 dasso aviation ne iske liye 100 se adhik bhartiya companiyon ko ishaara kiya he
 Of these, two state-owned companies are HAL and Bharat Electronics Limited
 ek to ishaara karne kaa kya matlab hota he ham nahin samajhe, abhi reliance kah rahi he ki raksha mantralay ko ho saktaa he ki ofaset partner ke bare main jaankaree na ho magar reliance ko pataa he ki 100 se adhik ofaset parteners ho sakate hai
 It also has two government companies
 kya yah mumkin ho saktaa he ki raksha mantralay ko itnaa bhi pataa na ho
 Are you satisfied with this answer? khayr aage badhate hai
 Reliance Defense has answered that question about how a company that has no experience got the contract
 hamen apane tathy sahi kar lene chahie
 No fighter aircraft are to be built under this contract as all aircraft are to come in fly away condition from France
 bharat main HAL ko chhod kisi bhi company ko ladaaku vimaan banane kaa anubhav nahin he
 If we follow this logic, it will mean that we will never be able to create any new capacity other than what we have now
 or raksha se jude 70% hardware ko aayaat karte rahenge

 25 other ceos of the Indian company were also present there

 sawaal to yahi he ki hindustan aironotics limited ko kyon baahar kiya gaya
 We should correct our facts
 is contract ke tahat koi ladaaku vimaan nahin banaae jane hai kyonki sabhi vimaan france se fli awe condishan main aane hai
 Except for HAL in India, no company has experience in making fighter aircraft
 agar is tark ke hisaab se chalem to iskaa matlab hoga ki ham jo abhi he uske alaava kabhi koi nai kshamta nahin bana paaenge
 And 70% of defense-related hardware will continue to be imported
 ek or sawaal kiya gaya kiya ki jab pradhanmantri paris main deal kaa elaan kar rahe the to anil ambani vahaan kyon maujuud the? ambani france or anya deshon ke liye CEO forum kaa hissaa the
 He was in Paris because the CEO Forum was also meeting there during the Prime Minister's visit
 bhartiya company ke 25 anya CEO bhi vahaan maujuud the
 He was also the chairman of HAL
 is jawaab main aapane suna ki pradhanmantri ke saath anya siio bhi the jinamein hindustan aironotics limited ke chairman bhi thi
 The question is why Hindustan Aeronautics Limited was excluded

 Shukla made it clear that Tharoor's meeting with Sonia Gandhi has nothing to do with the controversy
 unhone kaha ki donon ore se jo aarope lagaaye gayi hai, ye sabhi muddon par ipel kii sanchaalan parishad main uthaaye jaayenge
 Regarding the questions asked about this, Shukla said that i do not want to make any comment about this nor to make any assessment on the allegations being made on each other

 Modi also indicated that he was under pressure not to make the names of the owners of the franchise public
 unhone kaha kimujhse kaha gaya tha ki main phenchiji ke maalikon kaa khulaasa nahin karun, visheshkar sunanda pushkar ke bare main
 Because Tharoor said that he is not a shareholder of this franchise and he was only in the role of a 'facilitator' (helping Kochi franchisees bid in the IPL)
 tharur ne yah bhi kaha ki unhone kabhi bhi modi se yah nahin kaha ki vah aresadableue ke shairdharakon ke naamon ko ujagar nahin karen

 Nepal Prime Minister Jhalnath Khanal, who is going through a difficult period, did not resign from his post on Saturday
 khanal ne yah nirnay sahyogi partiyon ke us suzav par liya ki yadi vah istipha dete hai to desh main ek gambheer raajnneetik sankat utpann ho jayega
 Late in the evening, an emergency meeting at the Communist Prime Minister's official residence was attended by Maoists, political parties supporting the government from outside and allies of the government
 baithak main dalon ne 31 agast tak khanal ko pad par bane rahane kaa suzav diya
 Let it be known that the deadline for framing of the new constitution has been set as 31 August
 gathbandhan sarkaar ke sahyogiyon ne kaha ki antarim samvidhan kii samaysima 31 agast ko samaapt ho rahi he or isaki jagah lene vaala nayaa samvidhan abhi taiyaar nahin he
 Keeping this in mind, the deadline for the creation of the new constitution has to be extended again
 unhone kaha ki aise main desh main yadi kaaryvahak sarkaar aati he to uske paas yah sanvaidhanik shakti nahin hogi ki vah samaysima badaye or yadi aisa hota he to desh main raajnneetik sankat utpann ho jayega
 Khanal's government has failed to carry forward the peace process and formulate a new constitution
 khanal ko ummid thi ki yadi vah apane istife kii ghoshnaa karte hai to isse maovadiyon par dabaav banegaa or unki sarkaar ek baar phir batch jaaegi
 Prior to this, the Prime Minister proposed to the Maoist leadership to include about 7000 out of around 20,000 fighters of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in the Nepal Army
 iske alaava unhone shesh prayek ladaakon ko kareeb saat lakh nepali rupee dene or un par se aarope waapas lene kaa bhi prastaav rakhaa he
 If the Maoists agree with Khanal's proposal, the Prime Minister will get rid of the announcement of leaving his post
 khanal ko ummid he ki maovadi pramukh pushp camel dahaal prachand unke prastaav se sahamat honge kyonki mantrimandal kii niyuktiyon main unhone purv maovadiyon ko kaaphi sahuliyatein deen
 The Prime Minister's hope, however, received a major setback on Friday when the Maoist leadership discussed Khanal's proposal on the PLA in a meeting and rejected it outright

 When Ganpati lives in the house, every difficulty becomes easy and if the day is the celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi, worship of Ganapati, what better chance can there be to get Bappa's grace
 bhadrapada shukla paksh kii chaturthi tithi yani ganpati ke janm kii tithi
 This special date has come this time on Monday, when the law will be done in the house by legislation, the establishment of Bappa and the worship of God will be done with great fanfare for 10 days
 kehete hai agar ganesh chaturthi par bhakt ghar or kaarobaar ke sthaan par ganpati kii pratishtha kar den to dhan dhaany se bhar jaataa he ghar or jivan main khushiyon ke har rang bhar jate hai
 But for this it is important to take care of Vastu as well
 ganesh devon ke dev hai, riddhi-siddhi ke daata hai or sabase pehle puuje jane vaale bhagwaan hai
 Obviously, if the devotees get their grace then there is no shortage of anything
 santan ke liye tarasate logon ke jivan main santan kii khushiyaan bhar jaati hai, to vahiin vivaah main aane vaali adchanon ko bhi bappa chutkiyon main dur kar dete hai
 Not only this, we also solve the health concerns

 So this is Ganpati's miracle
 yahi vajah he ki bappa ke bhakt saal main baaki din to unki puja karte hi hai, lekin ganesh chaturthi kaa unhen vishesh intjaar rahata he
 Because in these days no desire is ever incomplete by worshiping

 a post shared by Katrina Kaif (@katrinakaif) on Dec 19, 2017 at 11:41am PST Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been targeting his rivals through stories and jokes during his speech on several occasions
 in dinon modi 3 africa deshon ke daure par hai or unhone uganda main mazaakia andaaj main antarrashtriya str par apane kade pratidwandvi china par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Modi took part in the india-uganda Business Forum meeting in the African country of Uganda on Wednesday and during this time in his speech jokingly said the disadvantages of not using Indian products in a cheap affair and also the importance of his country made goods
 Kept in style pradhanmantri modine bhaashan ke dauraan bharat kii mahangi mashiinon ke peeche kaa kaaran bataate hue ek kahani sunai
 He said, 'when i was younger i used to hear a joke that a poor boy at a bus stop was selling a fan, who was giving a fan for one rupee
 duusare vaale ne 8 aane bataaya, teesraa 4 aane main pankhaa bech rahaa tha
 a man took 4 incoming fans, but he broke only after the fan was shaken 3-4 times, he immediately caught the fan and said that it was broken
 is par pankhaa bechney vaale ne jawaab diya ki maine pankhaa hilaane ko thodi kaha tha, pankhaa nahin mundi hilaani thi
 Prime Minister Modi was referring to expensive Indian products and cheap products from other countries
 china kii tulana main bhartiya utpaada thode mahange hai
 Narendra Modi went on to explain the essence of this jokes and said, 'some things may be expensive initially, but they last a long time
 jabaki sasti chijen kharidenge wo maheenon kharaab rahengi kyonki unhen thik karne vaala bhi usee desh se laana padegaa
 He assured the Ugandans, "I assure you that with Zero Defect, we are ready to give you machines, technology
" wo shuruyaat main mahangaa hoga
 But you have to decide whether to move the fan or shave the mundi? britain (unidet kingdom) kii pradhanmantri theresa me bharat daure par aa rahi hai
 Theresa will be visiting India from 6-8 November
 is dauraan vah piem modi se mulaakaat karengi
 During this bilateral dialogue, the leaders of the two countries will discuss the india-uk Strategic Partnership

 There will also be a meeting of the Joint Economic and Trade Committee to increase trade between the two countries

 It is jointly organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India
 summit se ye hoga phaaydaye indo-euke tech summit donon deshon ke bich vyapaar ko badhaane ke saath hi technology, entrprenyorship, innovations, dizin or hair ajukeshan ke kshetra main kaaphi phydemand sabit hogi
 In November last year, during PM Modi's visit to UK, both countries agreed to this summit
 koun hai theresa me?britain main sattadhari conservative party kii netatheresa mabritain kii vartmaan piem hai
 59-year-old Theresa is the second woman to become PM of Britain after Margaret Thatcher
 isse pehle vah britain kii grih mantri raheen
 59-year-old Theresa worked at the Bank of England before venturing into the world of politics
 unke pati philip jon me bhi ek banker hai
 Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has said that the Congress-led UPA government at the center will continue to support the party based on issues
 yadav ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki samaajawaadee party kendra kii samprag sarkaar ko mudde par aadhaarit samarthan jari rakhegi, lekin iske saath hi janhit ke mudde par sapa virdohi bhi darj karaayegi
 Describing the action taken by Mayawati on the leaders of criminal image in the party as mere drama, she said that all the ministers of the state government are of criminal character and challenged that the BSP should release the list of such leaders
 unhone daawa kiya ki mayawati sarkaar kaa shaayad hi aisa koi mantri ho jiske viruddh gambhir dhaaraon main mukademe na hon
 Talking about the increasing atrocities and corruption in Uttar Pradesh, he clarified that there is no option left in the state except President's rule
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki pradesh main sanvaidhanik sankat kii sthiti utpann ho gayi he
 The government is not taking any action even on the letter of the Governor
 sarkaar ke faisle se public hairaan bhi he or pareshaan bhi
 The issue of even and odd numbers of vehicles is not embracing anyone
 koi apni majaburi ginava rahaa he to koi sarkaar ko salaah de rahaa he
 Advocate by profession Baljit Singh says that the move should have been done first to repair the public transport system
 vahiin, software ejeeniyar rakesh raheja ne to ye kaha ki sidhaa farmaan sunaanaa thik nahin
 Government should also see practical aspects
 siesai kii akjicutive diarector anumita raay choudhary ne kaha ki dilli main badhate pradooshan ko lekar sarkaar ne jab iaiti kanpur se research karavaaya to pradooshan kii duusari sabase badi vajah gadiyon ko bataaya gaya
 The comments rajdhani main gadiyon kii kul taadaad takreeban 88 lakh he
 There are about 85 lakh private vehicles in which cars are about 27 lakhs, motorcycles are 29 lakhs and scooters are about 27 lakhs
 commercial gadiyon kii sankhya kareeb saadhe teen lakh he jisamen auto 81 hajaar, skool cab 1 lakh, taxi 32 hajaar or bas kareeb 20 hajaar hai
 This idea of the even-odd number, called road space reshaping, was first adopted in 1982 in Athens, and then during the Olympics in Santiago, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Beijing and London
 dekhnaa hoga ki sarkaar ise kitni sakhti se lagu karvaa paati he or isse logon kaa kitna saath miltaa he

 CSE Executive Director Anumita Rai Chaudhary said that when the government conducted research from IIT Kanpur about increasing pollution in Delhi, the second biggest reason for pollution was told to be the vehicles
 tippaniyan The total number of vehicles in the capital is around 88 lakhs
 inamen kareeb 85 lakh privet gaadiyaan hai jinamein car kareeb 27 lakh, motorcycle 29 lakh or scooter kareeb 27 lakh hai
 The number of commercial trains is around three and a half lakh, including auto 81 thousand, school cab 1 lakh, taxi 32 thousand and bus about 20 thousand
 ivan od number ke is vichaar ko road spes reshanning kehete hai jise pehali baar 1982 main athens main apanaaya gaya phir santiyago, mexico city, saao poulo, beijing or landan main olympic ke dauraan bhi aisa hua
 It has to be seen how strictly the government is able to implement it and how much people get along with it

 Saurashtra middle-order batsman Cheteshwar Pujara may have to wait a bit longer to make his ODI debut
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne iske sanket diye
 Pujara scored his second triple century of his career in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinal match
 dhoni ne essie stadium main england ke khilaaf pehle ek divasiy match kii purv sandhya par kaha, ‚Äòuske (pujaara) vanade aagaaj kii sambhaavna bahut kam he kyonki hamen ballebaaji line ap ke saare sthanon ko dekhnaa hoga ki vah kis sthaan ke liye adarsh he or isi tarah kii anya chijen dekhni hongi
 So far it seems quite unlikely
 ‚Äôunhone kaha, ‚Äòdekhte hai ki kal kya hota he
 We will see if there is any unfit
 ‚Äô pujaara ne subah karnataka ke khilaaf ranjai trophy quarterfinal match main karnataka ke khilaaf 352 ran kii pari kheli
 He has played nine Tests for India and has scored three centuries and a half-century in his international career
 is 24 varshiya cricketer ko virendra sahvaag kii jagah pehali baar vanade team main shaamil kiya gaya he
 Instead of practicing with the Indian team, Pujara continued to play in a Ranji Trophy match with permission from the team management
 dhoni ne kaha, ‚Äòabhi tak sabhi feet hai
 i do not know if there should be some changes by night, but all are fit so far
 ‚Äôdhoni ne sweekaar kiya ki pichley kuch samay main bhartiya team ko badi salaami bhagidaari kii kami se nuksaan hua he
 Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir are struggling to give big salute partnerships
 dhoni ne kaha, ‚Äòaankade bayaan karte hai ki pichley kuch samay se hamen salaami saajhedaari ke rup main acchhee shuruyaat nahin mili he
 Yes, the openers are scoring occasionally but we are not able to see a good partnership between them
 donon main se ek out ho jaataa hai
 We hope to start well in this series
 ‚Äô unhone kaha, ‚Äòjinks (anjikya rahane) nayaa salaami ballebaaj he
 He has done well
 ‚Äô dhoni haalanki shrinkhalaaon main mili haar se khud kii or team kii aalochana se pareshaan nahin hai
 He said, 'criticisms are not new to us
 bataur bhartiya cricketer, aap jaanate hai ki aapako acha pradarshan karnaa hota he
 The moment we do not do well as a player or team, you know that you will have to face a lot of criticism
 ‚Äôdhoni ne kaha, ‚Äòlekin jab aap acha karte ho to bhi aisa hi hota he, tab aapako kaaphi prashansa milti he
 i have always said that being in a good field as a team is very important because if you are in this good field then you will have more chances to succeed and perform
 ‚Äôkuch purv cricketron ne khel ke ek yaa adhik praayapon main captaini chhodane kaa suzav diya tha, dhoni ne kaha, ‚Äòhamen itanjar kar dekhnaa hoga
 It is not on my mind right now before the important series
 ham iske bare main abhi nahin soch sakate
 Let's wait and see
 ‚Äôdhoni ne sweekaar kiya ki kam samay main ek praaroop se duusare praaroop main khelnaa kaaphi mushkil cheez he, lekin is baat se khush the ki team pakistan ke khilaaf teen maichon kii shrinkhalaa ke baad paanch maichon kii vanade shrinkhalaa khel rahi he
 He said, 'it is a bit difficult to play from one format to another (from big format to small)
 tii20 main khelnaa bilkul alag chunauti hoti he
 But at the top level, as a player you are expected to face these challenges firmly
 ‚Äô India's veteran batsman Suresh Raina has undergone his knee surgery in Amsterdam
 is vajah se vah gharelu cricket ke aagaamee sijan se kuch samay ke liye baahar rahenge
 The BCCI has said that he will be off the field for about 4 to 6 weeks

 Let us tell you that on February 16, the ED arrested Aamir Gajadhar, close to Zakir
 maamle kii jaanch kar rahe adhikariyon ne daawa kiya ki aamir gajdhar jakir nike or uske enjio kii ore se 200 karod rupee ke nagad len-dein ke maamle main shaamil tha
 The ED has issued a summons to Naik for Giridhar's company allegedly providing material for IRP KPS TV
 is silsile main idi ne jakir nike ko bhi samman jari kiya he
 Zakir Naik is yet to appear before the investigating agencies
 philhal jakir nike desh se baahar hai
 The National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the ED are investigating the matter
 NIA ne darj kiya tha jakir ke khilaaf kesagauratlab he ki enie ne 51 varshiya nike ke khilaaf vibhinn dharmik samoohon ke bich vaimnasy ko kathith rup se badhaava dene ko lekar aatankwaad nirodhak kanoonon ke tahat maamla darj kiya tha

 darasal pichley saal dhaka hamale main shaamil aatankiyon ne daawa kiya tha ki unhen nike ke bhaashanon se prerana mili thi
 They were also involved in inciting incitement against the country, they used to put threatening posters in the Jammu and Kashmir Police on Monday
 police ne sopor main alag-alag sanghathanon ke liye kaam karne vaale 8 ground workars ko giraftaar kiya he
 The arrested terrorists worked at the grassroots level for terrorist organizations and used to gather information for them
 sutron ke mutabik giraftaar kiye gaye sadsy kashmir ke logon ko dhamkaane or desh ke khilaaf bhadakaane ke maamalon main bhi sanlipt the
 Sources in the police say that the arrested militants were the ones who also put up threatening posters in different areas of Kashmir
 gauratlab he ki abhi chand dinon pehle hi sena ne kashmir main do pakistan aatankwaadiyon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Within a week, the police arrested 8 terrorists
 bataa den ki aatankwaadi sanghathan ghati main poster lagaakar logon ko dhamkaate rahe hai
 Just a few days after the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, the terrorists had put up posters asking people not to open shops
 ek acchhee naukari aapaki qualification ke vajah se milti he
 But we cannot stop that the right way of giving interview can also give you a good job
 media reports ke mutbik, ek recruiting software company main chif pipal officer rechal bite ne bataaya he ki aksar candidet intervyuu dete vakt aisi do galtiyaan kar dete hai, jis vajah se vah naukari kho dete hai
 She said that she had been a recruiter and HR executive at Apple and Inchuit
 jahaan unhone 6,000 se zyada logon kaa intervyuu liya
 When the daily routine becomes the shout of the boss, so keep yourself cool, what are the mistakes, do not present yourself in a simple manner, where the behavior of the candidate does not become soft during the interview
 unhone kaha ki phone intervyuu ke baad ek candidet ko duusare round ke liye brakefast par bulaayaa
 But the way he behaved with the hotel staff, it became clear that he was a human being
 unhone kahana he ki jab bhi koi candidet intervyuu dene aaen to vah narmi se pesh aaen
 Your bad behavior will not get the job, as well as your image may also raise questions
 jab team de acchhee parfomens, to aise badhayen team kaa hausala
 
 
 Do not ask questions, they said that you are going to interview for a job in a new company, and if you do not ask any questions related to the company, then it also has an incorrect impression
 recruiter ko lagata he ki aap naukari ko lekar syrius nahin he or nai company ke bare main kuch nahin jaanate
 He says that the candidate in the company who is going to give interview, do research about it
 taaki aap recruiter se company se sambandhit sawaal- jawaab kar saken
 One thing to always keep in mind that whenever you ask an awkward and logical question, no one will consider you stupid

 sarkaar kingfisher airlines ko sidhe taur par vimaan eendhan (atief) kaa aayaat karne kii yojana ko manjuuri dene par vichaar kar rahi he lekin tel companiyon ne is pahal kii yah kehete hue aalochana kii he ki zyada kar or parichaalan laagat ke maddenjar is sankatagrast company ke liye aarthik rup se galat faisla he
 Official sources said that in response to Kingfisher's application for direct jet fuel import, oil companies said that jet fuel production in India is overstated and about half of the product is exported annually
 tel companiyon ne kaha ki sidhe taur par jet eendhan ke aayaat se is eendhan kaa ek saath aayaat-niryaat hoga or desh ke bandargahon par bevajaah kaa boj padegaa
 It is believed that Kingfisher will be able to directly import jet fuel and save sales tax
 ullekhneey he rajyon main bikri kar chaar se 30 fisad lagata he
 Oil companies, however, said that Kingfisher 12 on imported jet fuel
 83 fisad shulk kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Whereas Kingfisher currently purchases Jet fuel from oil companies only
 24 fisad kaa utpaada shulk detii he
 The comments sutron ne kaha ki sarkari tel upakramon ne yah saaf kar diya ki unke paas bharat main kisi bhi bandargah par atirikt buniyadi dhaancha nahin he jiskaa upyog kingfisher apane jet eendhan ke aayaat ke liye kar sakati he
 Apart from this, the company will either have to build its own tank for storage of jet fuel or rent it from oil companies
 iske baad hawaonddon tak jet eendhan laane ke liye trakon kii vyavastha kerani hogi
 Even after such an exercise, Kingfisher will be able to provide fuel at only three airports - Delhi Hyderabad and Bangalore
 baaki hawaonddon par tel companio kaa ekadhikaar he or iske liye vimaanan companiyon ko baatcheet karne or tel companiyon se vishesh samjhaute karne kii jarurat hogi

 Oil companies said that direct import of jet fuel would lead to simultaneous import-export of this fuel and the country's ports would be unnecessarily burdened
 samajha jaataa he ki kingfisher sidhe taur par jet eendhan kaa aayaat kar bikri kar kii bachat kar sakegaa
 It is noteworthy that sales tax in states is four to 30 percent
 tel companiyon ne haalanki kaha ki kingfisher ko aaayaatit jet eendhan par 12
 83% fee will have to be paid
 jabaki kingfisher philhal tel companiyon se jet eendhan kii kharid par sif 8

 tippaniyan Sources said the state-owned oil companies made it clear that they did not have additional infrastructure at any port in India that Kingfisher could use to import its jet fuel
 iske alaava company ko jet eendhan ke liye yaa to bhandaaran ke liye apana tanks bananaa hoga yaa phir tel companiyon se kiraye par lenaa hoga
 After this, trucks will have to be arranged to bring jet fuel to the airports
 itani kavayad ke baad bhi kingfisher sirf teen hawaonddon - dilli hyderabad or bangalore - par eendhan muhaiyaa kara sakegi
 The rest of the airports are monopolized by the oil companies and for this the airlines will need to negotiate and enter into special agreements with the oil companies

 The investigation team formed to search for missing files related to Ishrat Jahan encounter case has submitted its report to Home Secretary Rajiv Maharishi
 grih mantralay sutron kii maane to jo filein gaayab hai, usamen se keval ek dastavej mila he baaki kaa abhi tak koi pataa nahin he
 The Home Secretary has to take a decision on what action to take on the report now
 52 pannon kii jaanch reportdrasal adishnal secretary bi ke prasadgum filonko lekar jaanch kar rahe the
 In this 52-page report, only one file is mentioned in the report, the file found is related to the then Attorney General GE Vahanvati
 jaanch team ne report taiyaar karne ke dauraan isse jude 11 daftaron ke logon se poochtacha kii
 According to Logaripart, who is attached to the Ministry of Home Affairs under suspicion, the files between Ishrat Jahan encounter between 18 and 28 September 2009 are missing and p Chidambaram was the Union Home Minister at that time
 jaanch team ke mutabik kul 6 draft papers gum hai
 According to the report, the files were deliberately mislaid and people within the home ministry are under suspicion
 rajnath ne sansad main filein gum hone kaa kiya tha zikrgauratlab he ki grih mantralay ne filon kaa pataa lagane ke liye ekasadasyeey cametibanaai thi
 On 10 March, Home Minister Rajnath Singh revealed in Parliament that important files of the Ishrat Jahan case were missing

 Fifty-year-old Amit Anilchandra Shah will become the new BJP President tomorrow
 party mukhyalay par dopaher baarah baje sansadeey board kii baithak main unke naam par muhar lag jaaegi
 Shortly thereafter, his name will be formally announced
 is maheene ke ant yaa agle maheene kii shuruyaat main shah apni nai team bhi ghoshit kar denge, jo zaahir he behad yuva hone ja rahi he
 This will be a picture of a changed BJP
 amit shah ke naam ko hari jhandi dete vakt rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii soch ye rahi he ki party ke satta main aane ke baad sanghathan kahin dhilaa na pad jaae isliye ise gatisheel banaae rakhane ke liye ek sakriy adhyaksh chahie
 Amit Shah fits this role perfectly, because in just nine months, he has shown the best performance of BJP by using Narendra Modi's name in Uttar Pradesh
 bijepi ne rajya kii 80 main se 71 siten apane boote or sahyogi apana dal ke saath 73 siten jiti hai
 They are going to get their remuneration
 party ke kuch netaaon ke man main ye sawaal the ki kya gujarat se hi pradhanmantri or party adhyaksh kaa hona thik rahegaa? lekin baad main ye tay kiya gaya ki sirf isliye shah kii daavedaari nazarandaaz karnaa thik nahin hoga, kyonki vah or pradhanmantri donon gujarat se aate hai
 These questions were also asked that the fake encounter case of Sohrabuddin is going on against Shah and in such a case, would it be right to make him BJP President
 lekin iske jawaab main daleel di gai ki party hameshaa se is maamle ko raajnneeti se prerit maanati rahi he, lihaaza iskaa raajnneetik asar nahin hona chahie
 Some leaders also cited the example of Lal Krishna Advani, who resigned from the Lok Sabha after being named in the hawala case but remained the party president
 amit shah ko ye jimmedaari dene ke peeche khaas vajah unki turat faisle karne kii kshamta, sanghathan par unki pakad or unke peeche pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa khul kar samarthan hona mana ja rahaa he
 In fact, in the BJP, it has been believed that during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government, there were some presidents who could not meet the expectations
 iske liye khaastaur se bangaroo lakshmana or ke janakrishnamurthi kaa naam liya jaataa he
 But there is a general opinion that during the presidency of a strong leader like Kushabhau Thackeray, not only the organization gained momentum but the government's functioning was also kept sharp
 ‚Äònishkaam karmyogi‚Äô ke naam se mashhoor thakare ko sakht, anushasanpriya or sanghathan par pakad bana kar rakhane vaale adhyaksh ke rup main yaad rakhaa jaataa he
 While party president on some issues, he also questioned the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 ab jabaki bijepi apane boote par bahumat paakar centre main sattarudh hui he, sawaal yah rahaa tha ki party ko kaisaa adhyaksh chahie
 That is why everyone's eyes will be on Amit Shah's work
 is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki bijepi aglaa loksabhaa chunaav bhi unheen kii aguwai main ladegi
 The results of the assembly elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand, to be held in the next few months, will be the next test of the image of his successful strategist
 saath hi ye bhi dekha jaataa rahegaa ki sarkaar or sanghathan main talmail bitha paane main vah kis had tak kaamyaab ho paaenge
 The question is also whether the bjp's search for the next Kushabhau Thackeray as Amit Shah will be completed? hindustan puri tarah chunavi rang main ranga hua he
 Everyone is making political statements and manipulative work is going on
 koi raajnneetik party jwoin kar rahaa he, to koi party badal rahaa he
 Be it a cricket player or a Bollywood star
 raajnneetik bayaanbaji ko hawa dene main soshal media ahm bhoomika nibhaa rahaa he
 All are resorting to social media to speak publicly
 har kisi kii apni vichaardhaara or raajnneetik najariya he

 Also asked Gautam Gambhir to tweet only about IPL
 jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne gautam gambhir ke twit ko retweet karte hue likhaa, 'gautam, maine zyada cricket kabhi nahin khelaa, kyonki main jaanata tha ki main cricket khilne main zyada acha nahin hum
 You neither know much about Jammu and Kashmir nor do you know about its history

 If you also like to take pictures and save them, then we have brought some special information related to the camera for you
 inhen jaanane ke baad aapaki tasviren apekshaakrit khubasurat ho jaaengi
 1
 camera kaise kaam karata he?jab aap camere ke batan ko tasviir lene ke liye dabaate hai to yah parde kii tarah khulata he, jisase roshni lens se hote hue sensor par padati he
 The shutter opens for 1 / 200 seconds during the daytime, while the shutter remains open for longer hours at night
 2
 Why do pictures get blurred? It often happens to all of us that while taking pictures our hand trembles and becomes a good photo
 aise main aap trypod kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Many times, due to movement in the object whose picture you are taking, it also gets blurred
 isamen shater speed kii bhi badi bhoomika hoti he
 For that, you have to align with the movement of the object
 3
 How to focus? When taking a photo, we usually focus on the object
 yah koi jivit insaan, pashu yaa phir koi vastu bhi ho sakati he
 For the best picture, you have to move the lens forward or backward
 kai baar isse aap object ko follow bhi kar sakate hai
 4
 digital yaa film?digital photography main sahuuliyat hone ke baavjood aaj bhi aise kai photographer hai jo film kaa istemaal karne main khud ko sahaj pate hai
 In this, photographs are recorded first and later developed
 5
 What is the use of large lenses
 
 
 vaise to aam photography karne waalon kshatirikt lenski jarurat nahin hoti, lekin profeshnal photographers ke paas focal length se choti physical length vaale lens tak hote hai
 They use them to focus the object and increase near-distance subtraction

 But last week here from Assam, a young woman with a mother was depressed and upset to meet her favorite writer Ruskin Bond
 din bhar bhatakane ke baad shaam ko jab vah landhor ke ivi cottage sthit bond ke, ek dharohar main tabdeel ho chuke chote-se shant ashiyane par pahunchi to uske aansu rukne ko nahin aa rahe the
 Mother held her legs

 And say sleep now, sleep now
 '' 19 may ko bharat ke mashhoor kathakaar ruskin bond 85 varsh ke ho rahe hai
 But he had learned this while struggling as a writer not to take himself too seriously
 ise aap unke paas rahete hue nirantar mahasoos kar sakate hai
 Talking back to the chair, he points to the book on the table in front
 haal hi main aayaa yah unke kisi kahani sangrah kaa kannada anuwaad he
 "kannada people call me Ruskin Bonda, aloo-bondawala
" '' yah kahkar ve khud bhi khilakhilaate hai, bal sulabh andaaj main

 You also read: In recent years many of your story collections and novels have come in Hindi
 aapaki aatmakatha lone fox daancing kaa bhi anuwaad ho rahaa he
 Did Hindi publishers not show interest or interest in the past? My books were not being sold in English in the sixties, then why would a Hindi publisher be interested? 3‚Äì4 printed from Bombay India Book House (popular publisher of those days)
 vaali kitabon ko hi log nahin kharid rahe the to meri kitaab ke anuwaad main koi kyon dilchaspee letaa? isiilie un dinon akhabaaron or patrikaon main likh rahaa tha ki kam-se-kam pachaasek ru
 So get it
 to kya ab hindi ke pathakon se bhi kisi tarah kaa samvaad hota he?thora-bahut, zyada nahin
 Anyway, bookshops in Mussoorie and Dehradun often do not keep Hindi books
 iske liye dehradun main palaton bazaar ke bheetar janaa padegaa
 During my stay in Bhopal, Indore and Raipur last year, i definitely got young readers of my Hindi books
 par yahaan kitaab waalon kii dilchaspee angreji kii kitaaben bechney main hi hoti he
 a businessman would like to sell only expensive books, and Hindi books are cheaper than English
 shimla main skool ke dinon main aapako to mohan rakesh ne hindi padhaayaa he
 Yes, i was the most fighting in class in Hindi
 wo mujhase hindi main kuch bolvaate the, jis par puri class hansatii thi
 Once his (probably first) wife complained to me that i live in India and my Hindi is so bad! i said, what to do, your husband has taught (laughs)
 isi 19 may ko aap 85 varsh ke ho jaaenge
 If you look back on the eve of next birthday, what do you see? Life today is as satisfying and relaxed as it was before
 aaj mere paas ek readership he, kitaaben bik rahi hai, roylty ke saath kuch aamadani bhi ho rahi he
 In that sense, i have reached the zenith
 jis parivaar ko god liya, uske bhi bachche bade hokar kuch na kuch kar rahe hai
 Touchwood is also healthy
 shaareerik bhi or maansik bhi
 In this moment of life, people usually sit and calculate their work
 par aapako dekhakar lagata he, aapane jitne kirdaar rache, usase zyada ko abhi bachaakar rakhaa he
 this is true
 aapaki umr jitani badhati he, aapke paas peeche dekhne ko utana hi zyada hota he
 i did not live a lot of adventure life, but yes, i did get a writer's life
 or pahari par rahane kaa ek phayda yah bhi he ki upar se duniya ko dekhne par use dekhne kaa aapako ek najariya or ek samaj bhi mil jaati he
 Secondly, gradually i have become closer to nature, this process started after i settled here (landor, Mussoorie)
 4-5 saal dilli main rahaa par vahaan se bhaag khadaa hua
 i always ran from one place to another
 rasty (unki aatmakathaatmak siries kaa kirdaar) pehle to ghar se bhaaga, phir skool se, phir england bhaag gaya, vahaan se bhi bhaag aayaa, phir bhagkar pahari par aakar chadh gaya
 Next destination? Mountains (laughs)
 khayr, ab bhaagambhag ruk gai he
 Your realism is amazing along with your characters and the details around them
 aapane naatak kiye bhi hai or clasik draamein bhi padhate rahe
 Do you think that the craft of theater helps a writer with a deep observation to create an anecdote? See, craft has its place
 par mujhe lagata he ki kisi vaakya ko likhnaa kaaphi nahin hota, use gadhia hota he
 Putting words differently makes them more interesting
 mere bheetar yah yuvavastha main hi ghatane laga tha, jab main padhata bahut tha
 i loved my authors who had a different style
 kisi lekhak kaa likhaa hua, uski style alag se hi pahchaan main aani chahie
 So craft is important, but learning to write is not enough
 mujhase log aksar poochhate hai, ''lekhak janmajaat hota he yaa gadha jaataa he?'' mere maamle main to yahi kahuunga ki main paidaaishi lekhak tha
 Even at the age of 5-6, i used to write something
 lekin aage badaae ke saath aapako apni lekhnee par kaam karte rahanaa hota he
 In this, you constantly learn
 meri pasandida kitaab moti-tagdi oxford english dictionari ye dekhie, yahi padi he (saamne kitabon kii teble kii ore ishaara karte hai)
 i am equally thrilled today to know the meaning of words, their origin and their journey
 basikali main ek fiction riter hum
 But i have associated fiction with autobiography and personal writing
 nibandhon se shuru kiya tha, phir kahaniyaan shuru kin, kavitaayen bhi likhin
 That is, written in every genre
 haa, naatak nahin likh paaya
 Reason: Except Marathi and Bangla, where is the stage of English plays in Hindustan? To become an English-language playwright you have to live in New York or London
 aapane assi kii umr paar karne ke baad aatmakatha likhi

 So this autobiography covers details from the age of 50-60

 i can easily count the names of all the books of particular authors

 My good memory has been very helpful in my creations
 koi bhi cheez yaa apni pandulipiyaan idhar-udhar rakhkar bhuulataa bhi nahin
 It has been many decades since you lived in Mussoorie
 is dauraan yahaan kis tarah ke badlaav dekhe hai aapane?yahaan ke logon ke liye jindagi ab bhi mushkil he
 Those who have read a little, go into the army and the young men take the way to Delhi, Dehradun or some other city
 puure pahari kshetra kaa yahi haal he
 If you go to the villages, you will find only old and old people
 yah traasad sthiti he
 As far as Mussoorie is concerned, the middle class has become increasingly prosperous in the last five years in the country

 But surprisingly, the borders of countries are getting harder
 log simaaon ko lekar zyada sajag ho gaye hai
 We became more able to travel but now we need more visas
 pratham vishwayuddh se pehle kahin koi vija hi nahin lagata tha
 The concept of passport came at the same time, otherwise you can go anywhere
 aapaki kahaniyon par vishaal bharadwaj (da blue ambrella or saat khun maaf) or usase pehle shyaam benegal (junun) jaise bade filmmekars ne filmein banaain, phir bhi aap cinema ke liye or script likhane ko kyon inspire nahin hue?mere liye script likhnaa bahut boring kaam he
 i made the screenplay for Saat Khoon Maaf as a story, but in the end, it completely changed
 lekin agar kisi achche diarector ko meri koi kahani pasand aati he or vah us par film bananaa chaahe to mujhe khushi hogi
 i would gladly give him the authority, the way Vishal gave him and Shashi Kapoor for passion, which was set in the backdrop of the 1857 story a Flight of Peoples
 vishaal ke paas meri ek or kahani he
 Now it is not known when they will film on it
 iske alaava bhuton vaali meri kuch kahaniyon ko in dinon netflix digital films main laayaa ja rahaa he, jinhen aap apane mobile par bhi dekh sakate hai
 But i am not going to see
 is (digital) medium main meri ratti bhar bhi dilchaspee nahin
 However, people are happy to carry my stories by paying my fees
 technology kaa mujhe agar istemaal na karnaa pade, to mujhe usase koi dikkat nahin
 Your love stories have been mostly sad
 aisa kyon?bees ke aasapaas kii umr main maine romantic flavor vaali kai kahaniyaan likhin kyonki vah meraa romantic period tha
 For example, night train at Deoli, Time stops at Shamli
 meraa un dinon baar-baar romance chal rahaa tha, praayah ekatarfa
 Then the stories were also sad
 par pichley hi hafte maine da garden of drims naam se ek nai kahani likhi he, jisamen sukhaant he
 Whom i fall in love with, it comes back again
 chaaron ore hansi-khushi
 Because it is just a dream
 par maine sochaa, chalo ek prem kahani to sukhaant vaali likh daalun
 However, i have also written it away (laughs) against the backdrop of Kathmandu
 aapako nahin lagata, aapane apni or apane lekhak kii personality ko anderple kiya he?dekhie, pachaas, saath or sattar ke dashak main main likh to bahut rahaa tha par koi khaas pahchaan nahin mili
 In such a situation, i was not even tempted to consider myself a special writer
 yah to pichley 15-20 saal main meri readership badi he
 Some stories have become known to younger readers by joining school-college courses
 ek din ek pathak kii chitthee ai ki uske paas meri 90 kitaaben hai, yani kareeb-kareeb sari
 It is good that success is not achieved very quickly
 jaldi mil gai hoti to shaayad main itani parvaah hi na karata or ganvaa detaa
 And sometimes, if you become more successful, then the gods are jealous

 If success comes slowly then good
 aap dharmik nahin rahe hai par aajkal dharm kaaphi sir chadhakar bol rahaa he
 What will you say about this environment? It is a worldwide phenomenon
 khaasi bebasii, udaasi or bikharaav vaala daur he
 In such a situation, the attitude of many people has become narrow
 main khaas dharmik yaa aadhyatmik vyakti nahin
 You can call me a man with common sense
 par main kisi ke bhi dharm, puujaapaddati or aasthaa ke adhikaron kaa pakshdhar hum, basharte mujhe vaisaa karne ko majaboor na kiya jaae
 But these kinds of times go on in the history of human life
