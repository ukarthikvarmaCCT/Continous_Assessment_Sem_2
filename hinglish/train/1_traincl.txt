 When the Tamil Nadu Assembly passed a unanimous resolution against the hanging of Rajiv Gandhi's killers and released them, our collective consciousness could not reach Chennai due to being in North India
 lekin jaise hi khabar ai ki jammu-kashmir vidhansabha main afazal guru kii faansee ke kilaaf prastaav paas ho saktaa he to turant samuhik chetana puure uttar bharat main naachne lagi
 The proposal did not pass there, but when there was protest against the hanging of Rajoana in Punjab, the collective consciousness went to Shimla from Kalka Mail to celebrate the holiday
 tippaniyan In March 2012, Akali Dal called for a Punjab bandh to protest against the hanging of Balwant Singh Rajoana
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh captain amarinder singh ne bhi faansee kaa virodh kiya or akali dal ne to kiya hi
 BJP never changed its line but never changed its friend
 bijepi aaj bhi faansee kaa samarthan karti he magar virodh karne vaale ko apni sarkaar main jagah bhi detii he
 In the terrorist attack in which Balwant Singh Rajoana was convicted, 17 people including the Chief Minister were killed
 us vakt rajoana ne ek patr bhi likhaa tha ki mujhe akali dal ke netao se koi madad nahin chahie
 They have done nothing to bring justice to the Sikhs
 itihaas akali dal ko kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 Nevertheless, the Akali Dal supported and the death sentence was hanged
 aaj ham akali dal, congress, bijepi or sipiem netaaon ke saath hai jinase baat karenge ki kya unamem saahas he ki ve un chand vakeelon kii tarah unmaad kaa shikaar hote hue bhi faansee kaa virodh kar sakate hai
 If there is a protest against the execution, then why are the responsibilities of two or four lawyers
 raajnneetik dal apni line kyon nahin saaf karte
 Does our politics panic with the so-called collective consciousness
 hamen samajhnaa chahie ki netaaon or dalon par vakti janamat kaa dabaav or bhay hota he, shaayad shashi tharur par bhi rahaa hoga lekin faansee ke baad hi sahi unka twit kam saahasik nahin he
 Shashi Tharoor said that 'I am sad that our government has hanged a human being
 rajya pryojit hatya ham sabko bhi hatyare main badal detii he
 i am not commenting on the merit of a case, it has to be decided by the Supreme Court
 samasya he faansee ko lekar
 We must fight terrorism but this kind of killing has not stopped terrorism anywhere
 ' The Congress could move forward with the line of Shashi Tharoor, but the party knows that the leaders of the Tharoor type do not fit into the politics of collective consciousness
 landan main wo koi baat kah de to pradhanmantri ko bhi janch jaati he magar bharat main hawa ke khilaaf bol den to sab daaen baayen dekhne lagate hai
 Congress Party spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala said that hanging has been part of the penal law in the country for 67 years
 ye reerest of rer cese main hi di jaati he
 The party cannot talk of any change in it
 agar puri sansad chaahe to is par vichaar kar sakati he
 As long as it is part of the penal legislation, it should be fully compliant
 to congress apni raay tabhi bataaegi jab sansad apni raay bataaegi
 You can tell that without the opinion of the parties, can the Parliament give its opinion first
 shashi tharur ke bayaan se duuri banane kii uski majaburi kya us tathakthith samuhik chetana ke kaaran thi
 This collective consciousness should also be understood properly
 yah sahi he ki faansee kaa samarthan karne waalon kii taadaad kam nahin he lekin yah bhi sahi he ki unka laabh uthaakar unmaad failaane vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 In my opinion, three types of sections are active in support of capital punishment
 ek tabaka faansee kii sazaa kaa samarthak rahaa he to ek aisa tabaka bhi rahaa jiskaa faansee se to virodh he magar aatankwaad jaise maamalon main faansee kaa samarthan he
 a third section took advantage of these two sections
 is tabake main shaamil log faansee ke samarthakon ke bahaane apni raajnneeti ke liye jagah banane lage hai, aisa karne vaale kai dalon main or donon samudaay ke log hai
 When Afzal Guru was hanged, the CPM mouthpiece People's Democracy wrote that Afzal's hanging would increase separatism in Kashmir
 jabaki seetaram yechuri ne kaha tha ki kanoon ne apana kaam kiya
 The case which had been stuck for 11 years came to an end
 ek tarah se yah sammaan or swaagat hi tha lekin is baar sipiem shuru se hi faansee ke khilaaf bol rahi thi
 Sitaram Yechury said that our party believes that there should be no punishment for hanging
 ham chaahate hai ki isamen badlaav ho, umraqaid kii paribhaasha badale
 
 
 
 umraqaid kaa matlab hona chahie zindagi ke aakiri din tak jail
 
 
 At present, only 14 years in prison is a jail term

 But as soon as the news came that the proposal against the hanging of Afzal Guru could be passed in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, the collective consciousness immediately started dancing all over North India
 vahaan prastaav to paas nahin hua lekin punjab main jab rajoana kii faansee kaa virodh hua to samuhik chetana chuttee manaane kalka mail se shimla chali gai
 The comments march 2012 main balavant singh rajoana kii faansee ke virodh main akali dal ne punjab band kaa aahvaan kiya
 Congress state president Captain Amarinder Singh also opposed the hanging and the Akali Dal did it
 bijepi ne kabhi apni line nahin badali magar kabhi apana dost nahin badla
 The BJP still supports hanging but also gives the opposition a place in its government
 balavant singh rajoana jis aatankwaadi hamale main doshi paye gaye the usamen mukhyamantri sahit 17 log maare gaye the
 At that time Rajoana also wrote a letter that i do not need any help from the Akali Dal leaders
 inhone sikhon ko nyaay dilaane ke liye kuch nahin kiya he
 History will never forgive the Akali Dal
 phir bhi akali dal ne samarthan kiya or faansee kii sazaa umr kaid main badali
 Today we are with the Akali Dal, Congress, BJP and CPM leaders with whom we will talk if they have the courage to protest against the execution of the frenzy like a few lawyers
 congress shashi tharur kii line ke sahare aage bad sakati thi magar party jaanati he samuhik chetana kii raajnneeti main tharur tip ke netaa feet nahin baithte
 If he says something in London, the Prime Minister is also shocked, but in India, if he speaks against the wind, then everyone starts looking left and right
 congress party ke pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne kaha ki 67 saal se desh main faansee dand vidhaan kaa hissaa he
 It is given only in the rarest of rare cases
 isamen badlaav kii koi baat party nahin kar sakati
 If the whole parliament wants it can consider it
 jab tak ye dand vidhaan kaa hissaa he iskaa puri tarah se anupaalan hona chahie
 So the Congress will express its opinion only when the Parliament gives its opinion
 aap bataaiye ki bina partiyon kii raay ke kya sansad apni raay pehle bataa sakati he
 Was his compulsion to distance himself from Shashi Tharoor's statement because of that so-called collective consciousness
 is samuhik chetana ko bhi thik se samajhnaa chahie
 It is true that the number of those who supported the hanging is not small, but it is also true that by taking advantage of them, those who spread the hysteria are not less
 meri raay main teen tarah kaa tabaka faansee kii sazaa ke samarthan main sakriy he
 One section has been a supporter of the execution of the sentence, while there has been a section which is opposed to the hanging but there is support for hanging in cases like terrorism
 in donon tabake kaa laabh ek tisare tabake ne uthaaya
 People in this section have started making space for their politics under the pretext of hanging supporters, many parties and people of both communities doing so

 sapa ke rashtriya adhiveshan main deshbhar se party ke kareeb 15,000 pratinidhi hissaa le rahe hai
 In this session various national and local issues will be discussed and economic and political resolutions will be passed

 Those close to Shivpal say that after the national session of SP, he can take a decision

 (with agency input) mek in india or mek in america duniya kii do badi arthvyavasthaaon kii koshish he jiske jariye vah khud ko global manuphaccharing hub banaate hue apane-apane desh main rojgaar ke bade sansaadhan paidaa karne kii he
 During the past 9 months, this effort in the US is now being called a failure because President Donald Trump had to dissolve the Business Council for Make in America
 vahiin bharat ko mek in india kii raah par aage badhane ke liye kadi chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Therefore, the need is that India should learn from the failure of America and try to save its Make in India program from failure
 kyon chahie mek in india?kendra sarkaar kii flagship yojana he jiske tahat desh ko global manuphaccharing hub banaate hue rojgaar ke bade sansaadhan paidaa karnaa he
 The project was initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi after assuming power at the Center and efforts have been made to kickstart it for the last three years
 is yojana ke tahat desh main aise products kaa utpaadan karnaa he jisaki khapat puri duniya main ho sake
 Its advantage is to intensify business activities in the country as well as create huge employment opportunities
 ise bhi padhein: kaledhan par lagaam ke liye gold export par laga pratibandhkyon vifal ho gaya mek in america?mek in india kii tarj par disambar 2016 main america ke navnirvaachit raashtrapati donald trump ne bhi mek in america kii shuruyaat kii
 Trump's plan also aimed to create new jobs in the US
 iske liye america main satta kii kaman sambhalate hue raashtrapati trump ne desh kii top companio ke pramukhon ko shaamil karte hue white house main bijness adwijuri council gathit kii
 But in just 9 months, Trump was forced to dissolve this council and believe that Make in America was not a deal for the benefit of the business
 darasal manuphaccharing kshetra main keemat kam karne ke liye beete kai dashakon se america ne duniya ke duusare deshon main apni factriyaan lagaai he
 This reduced manufacturing costs and increased profits for American companies
 lekin iske chalate rajgaar ke kshetra main bade avasar america se baahar chale gaye
 Now, in the face of the Trump administration's efforts to bring back jobs, the challenge before American companies is to increase the product's product and reduce profits
 ise bhi padhein: america companiyon ko raas nahin aayaa mek in US, 9 maheene main fail, trump ne bhang kii bijness counsilbharat ko america se mili ye sikhpradhanmantri narendra modi udhyamita ko protsaahan dene kii muhimon par raay jaanane ke liye aaj 212 yuva udhyamiyon se mulaakaat kar rahe hai

 This exercise of the Prime Minister is being done to make Make in India a success in the country
 lekin america main manuphaccharing par jor dene kii vifaltaa se sarkaar ko yah samajhane kii jarurat he ki use desh kii vaastavik aarthik sthiti kaa jayja lete hue hi is disha main niti banane kii he
 Just trying to become a manufacturing hub on the lines of China, the failure of the entire plan is almost certain
 darasal, america dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan duniya ke liye manuphaccharing hub kaa tamgaa le chukaa tha
 During this time, America made its companies paramount in products that were in demand in every corner of the world
 is daur ke baad america companiyon ko apana munafa badhaane ke liye manuphaccharing ko duniya ke alag-alag konon main sthapit karne kii jarurat padi
 This move, where American companies reduced manufacturing costs and increased their profits further, while reducing the cost of global distribution of products
 lekin is dauraan bhi america companiyon ne technological research and deveopment par lagaataar jor diya or manuphaccharing ke kshetra main agrani bane rahe
 It seems that Shiv Sena has now decided that it will not take a step back from the 50-50 formula

 * * Do not feed, so much to the ego, * *vaqt ke sagar main kain,* * Alexander drowned
 
 ! * Let us tell you that in Maharashtra BJP got 105 seats and Shiv Sena got 56 seats and together they easily crossed 145
 lekin shivasena kaa kahana he ki gathbandhan ke samay hi dhai-dhai saal sarkaar banane kii baat par sahmati bani thi or bijepi ko use ab maananaa chahie
 The Shiv Sena says that due to this formula, the people have given majority to both the parties together
 lekin bijepi kaa kahana he ki aise kisi bhi formule par baatcheet nahin hui thi or maharashtra main puure paanch saal bijepi kaa hi mukhyamantri rahegaa
 At the same time, amidst the tussle between BJP and Shiv Sena, senior leaders of Maharashtra Congress are going to meet Sonia Gandhi in Delhi today
 sanjay raut ke ensipi pramukh se milane ke baad is baithak ko lekar kayaasabaaji bhi tej ho gai he

 Apart from Lalu Yadav and his family, Sharad Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav, Mamta Banerjee, Ghulam Nabi Azad, CPI leader d Raja, Hanumantha Rao of Congress, Elangovan of DMK, Tariq Anwar of NCP were present on the dais
 is raily main lalu ne nitish kumaar or bijepi kii centre sarkaar par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 In this, his family also supported him a lot
 patni rabari devi, bete tejpratap or tejasvi yadav ne apane bhaashan se modi sarkaar ko sabhi morche par vifal bataaya
 However, Rabri Devi was seen playing a role and role during this
 unhone na sirf bhaashan se modi or nitish ko aade haathon liya balki lalu ke bhaashan ke dauraan bich-bich main peeche se bolkar bhaashan sudhaarney main koi kasar nahin chodi
 Corrected Lalu During the speech, Lalu was seen speaking or forgetting his line several times
 haalanki jab rabari jaisi patni kaa saath ho jo aisi galati turant thik ho jaati he
 Something similar was seen in Gandhi Maidan's 'save the country, BJP bhagao' rally
 is raily main bhaashan dete hue jab lalu yadav ne mira kumaar ke raashtrapati pad kii daavedaari or piem narendra modi se haath milaane par nitish par nishaanaa saadh rahe the to unhone kaha ki yahi nitish kumaar ne piem narendra modi kaa pattal khinchaa tha or usee kaa badla narendra modi ne liya he
 He then said that Nitish was sitting on a silver platter with 52 bhog during the flood survey in Purnia, but Modi kicked and turned down
 is par peeche se rabari ne sudhara ki 52 nahin 156 bhoga
 Lalu then corrected the speech and said that yes there was also a banquet for Gujarat, Nitish was sitting with 156 Bhog in a silver plate, but Modi kicked and turned down
 rabari ko lalu laae the raajnneeti menapako bataa den rabari devi jahaan aaj bhaashan kala ke liye jane jane vaale lalu yadav ke shabdon ko sudhaar rahi hai
 There was a time when she did not want to enter politics
 haalanki yah lalu hi the, jinhone rabari devi ko confidence dekar unke rajnatik kariyar kii shuruyaat kii
 Lalu resigned as Chief Minister in 1997 after his arrest in the 'fodder scam' and made his wife Rabri Devi the Chief Minister of Bihar
 bataaya jaataa he ki lalu prasad yadav apni patni rabari devi kii salaah ke bina koi kaam nahin karte hai
 Many times he has also had to bow to the insistence of Rabri Devi
 bihar kii raajnneeti main unke bade bete tejpratap kii entry bhi unhi ke kaaran hui he
 Nitish was envious of Tejaswi, while addressing the rally before this, Lalu Yadav said that all the big leaders from Bihar at this time are all their products
 nitish par nishaanaa sadhate hue lalu ne kaha ki unhen to kabhi bhi nitish kumaar par bharosa nahin tha, lekin sampraadayik takaton ko rokane ke liye baari man se vidhansabha chunaav se pehle mahagathbandhan kiya tha
 We already knew about Nitish's move that this man is not trustworthy
 lalu ne kaha ki bihar kii raajnneeti main tejasvi yadav ke badhate kad se nitish kumaar pareshaan ho rahe the
 Nitish was burning inside, it was not seen from him that the boy next to him was becoming popular in public
 nitish sajishan tejasvi ko kalankit karne ke liye mahagathbandhan se alag hokar bijepi ke saath gaye

 haryana police kuch bhi daawa kare lekin reyaan skool main maasoom pradhyumna kii galaa retkar hatya kisne or kyon kii, yah sawaal abhi bhi logon ke man main jas kaa tas bana hua he
 On Friday evening, when Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar went to Pradyuman Thakur's house and announced that now the investigation of the case is being handed over to the CBI, the family members hoped that now they will get the answer
 haryana police daawa kar rahi he ki vah maamle kii tah tak pahunch chuki he or chargeshit lagbhag banakar taiyaar he
 But the disclosure of any case does not just mean that the police should put a man in front of someone who is committing a crime
 tahakikat kaa matlab hota he ki us maamle se jude saare sawaalon ke santoshjanak jawaab police ke saamne hon
 Pradyuman's assassination is not one, but many questions that the police have not yet considered necessary to answer
 pradhyumna ke gharavaale baar-baar yah kah rahe hai ki kahin uski hatya isliye to nahin ho gai ki usne kuch aisa dekh liya tha jisase bhed khulne kaa dar tha
 There are many unresolved questions about which the CBI will have to deal with
 1
 Pradyuman was killed on 8 September
 uske 2 din pehlereyan schulmen kuch aisa hua tha jo pehle kabhi nahin hota tha
 Almost all the children had boarded the school bus on their way home after school leave
 lekin skool bas nikal paati isse pehle hi sabhi bacchon se kaha gaya ki vah bas khaali karke vaapis apane class main jaaen
 After that all the drivers of the bus were called inside the school and had some conversations with them
 skool bas dobaaraa 1 ghante baad chali thi
 After all, why was the school bus stopped just before the move and what were the questions called by the drivers? Who stopped the buses suddenly and what was the reason? 2
 police daawa kar rahi he kipradyumnajab toilet main gaya tha tab usne bas ke conductor ashok ko aapattijanak haalat main dekh liya
 According to the police, Ashok tried to rape Pradyuman and after failing to do so, strangled him to death for fear of the case being opened
 lekin police cese kahani main kai khamiyaan hai
 The post-mortem report rejected the matter of raping
 agar police kii baat ko sach maane ki conductor ashok sachmuch toilet main hastmaithun kar rahaa tha, to yah baat bhi pakki hogi ki usne toilet kaa darwaja bheetar se band kiya hoga
 Even if he forgot to latch from within, he must have closed the door
 ek bas kaa conductor skool ke toilet main jab bacchon ke aane jane kaa samay ho darwaja kholkar aisa nahin karegaa
 According to the police, when he opened the door, he saw Ashok doing so
 lekin sawaal yah he ki pradhyumna ne toilet kaa darwaja aakhir kholaa hi kyon hoga? skool ke jis toilet ke bheetar uski hatya hui uske do hisse hai
 Urinals are open outside to urinate and in front of them are closed-door cabins, which have Indian seats
 jis samay pradhyumna kii hatya hui uske kandhe par skool kaa bag tha
 This meant that he had gone to the toilet just to pee and there was no need to open the door of the potty cabin
 yah baat maani hi nahin ja sakati ki agar pradhyumna ko peshaab nahin poti kerani thi to vah aakhir peeth par bag ladakar toilet kyon jaataa? yah sawaal or bhi mahatvapurn isiilie he kyonki pradhyumna kaa class toilet se chand kadam hi dur tha or agar vah chahta to apana bag class main rahakar toilet ja saktaa tha
 The police have no answer yet

 Police say the knife found by Ashok was part of the bus's toolkit
 bason ke tul kit main aamtaur par chaaku nahin hota
 Especially the knife that killed him
 sutron ke mutabik us chaaku ke upar steekar bhi laga hua tha iskaa matlab yah hua ki use haal main hi kharida gaya tha
 The police have not even tried to find out when and where Ashok bought the knife
 4
 The police contention is also beyond comprehension that Ashok took the knife to the toilet to wash it
 tulkit ke tamaam aujaaron main se aakhir chaaku ko hi dhone kii jarurat kyon thi? kya vah tulkit ke duusare aujaar bhi dhone ke liye laayaa tha? agar nahin to sirf chaaku hi kyon? skool main toilet se pehle bhi do jagah aise hai jahaan pani ke nal lage hai
 There is also a pipe installed at one place, so that the driver conductors simply wash
 chaaku dhone ke liye ashok ne toilet ke nal kaa hi istemaal kyon kiya? police ne is baat kii koi tahakikat nahin kii he ki kya isse pehle bhi duusare conductor apane tul kit kaa saamaan dhone ke liye bacchon ke toilet kaa istemaal karte the?5
 According to the police story, Ashok had Pradyuman lifted in the lap after cutting his throat to hide the blood stains on his clothes so that no one had any doubt about the blood stains on his clothes
 poochtacha main skool kii teacher ne bhi kaha ki unhone pradhyumna ko ashok kii god main dekha tha
 In such a situation, it would have been an attempt of the school that he should be rushed to the hospital as soon as possible
 lekin kuch aisa hua jo shaq paidaa karata he
 After picking up Pradyuman, Ashok came to the school reception but did not come to the hospital
 resepshan se skool ke ek chaparasi ne use apni god main uthaakar gaadi main bithaaya
 Ashok then stopped the school there and informed the police
 agar chaparasi pradhyumna ko lekar aspataal ja saktaa tha to conductor ashok kyon nahin? aakhir skool ne ashok ko kis vajah se apane paas hi roak liya?6
 The toilet in which the head of the murder has been cut has been cut in such a way that there is a place for someone to leave
 khaas baat yah he ki khidki kaa saria jang lagakar kharaab nahin hua he balki blade se kaata gaya lagata he
 Who and why the police of the toilet window were cut, the police officials did not understand the need to inquire deeply about this
 yah sawaal aise hai jinka police ne koi santoshjanak jawaab nahin diya he
 Was Pradyuman's assassination planned beforehand and forcibly dragged into a school toilet? Pradyuman's family hopes that the CBI investigation will find answers to all these questions

 Deora is considered close to Congress President Rahul Gandhi and his statement has led to differences with the Mumbai Congress, especially President Sanjay Nirupam
 milind devda ne apane bayaan main loksabhaa chunaav ladane ke rukh kii ore bhi ishaara bhi kiya he
 Congress leader Milind Deora wrote in his tweet, 'though i have no intention of making the inside of the party public, but a comment made in a recent interview made me want to remain a symbol of Mumbai's diversity and my social fabric- Forced to repeat his strong commitment to the need of the Mumbai Congress to strengthen Bane
 'while i do not intend to discuss internal party affairs in public, remarks made in a recent interview have forced me to repeat my strong commitment towards the need for the Mumbai Congress to remain a symbol of Mumbai’s diversity and to strengthen its social fabric
 - Milind Deora (@milinddeora) February 5, 2019 Deora further wrote in the tweet that in the country's economic and cultural city Mumbai, we need to bring people together
 mumbai congress sampradayik raajnneeti ke liye ek cricket pich nahin ban sakati he, jisamen netaa ek duusare ke khilaaf khadey kiye jaaen
 In a city like Mumbai, which is our economic and cultural capital, we need to bring people together
 The Mumbai Congress cannot become a cricket pitch for sectarian politics, with leaders pitted against one other
 - Milind Deora (@milinddeora) February 5, 2019 He wrote in a further tweet, 'I am disappointed in what is happening- and the party is aware of my stand to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki mujhe kendriya netritv or hamaari party kii vichaardhaara or siddhanton ke prati uski patibaddhta par purna vishwaas he

 Let me tell you that former Congress MP Priya Dutt had said that she will not contest this time
 haalanki unhone iske peeche kii vajah apane raajnneetik or nijee jivan main talmail nahin baith paane ko bataaya tha
 Let us tell you that Sanjay Nirupam has been the leader of Shiv Sena before and in 2005 he joined the Congress
 ve 2009 main congress ke saansad chune gaye lekin 2014 main chunaav haarane ke baavjood unhen mumbai congress kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 Nirupam is still considered an outsider by the Khanty Congress, who has learned politics in the militant culture of the Shiv Sena
 nirupam ke kaam karne ke taur tareeke ko lekar mumbai congress ke netaa congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se shikaayat bhi kar chuke hai
 But Nirupam became a political necessity of the Congress

 At the same time, a section of Mumbai Congress is with Milind Deora, whose father Murali Deora has led the Mumbai Congress for decades
 congress netaa milind devda majbootee se apni bebaak raay rakhane ke liye jane jate hai
 He criticized the Congress leadership even after the Congress was reduced to 44 seats in the Lok Sabha elections, saying that the responsibility of defeat is not just of the advisors but also those who take advice

 Amid the ongoing agitation for Maratha reservation in Maharashtra, the demand for Muslim reservation in the state has started to arise
 haalanki muslim samudaay sadak par utarkar pradarshan karne ke bajaay shantipurvak sarkaar or rajyapal se milakar kanoonee tareeke se aarakshan kii maang karegaa
 On Monday, Muslim society leaders and organizations held a meeting at Islam Gymkhana in Mumbai to push forward the demand for reservation

 ab unhone tay kiya he ki ve sadak par utarane ke bajaay kanoonee or shantipurvak tareeke se aarakshan kii maang karenge
 Those involved in the meeting said that Muslims are socio-economically backward
 muslim ko ucch shiksha main 5 fisadi aarakshan diya gaya tha jise adaalat ne barkaraar rakhaa tha, lekin sarkaar is par karrwai nahin kii or adhyadesh samaapt ho gaya
 Maulana Mahmood Daryabadi, general secretary of the Ulema Council, said that now 10 percent reservation for Muslims in jobs and education is demanding
 unhone kaha ki adalat ne maratha aarakshan ko khaarij kar diya tha, lekinmuslim aarakshanko is aadhaar par kaayam rakhaa tha ki samudaay aarthik rup se pichhadaa he
 In such a situation, Muslims should be given reservation
 congress netaa naseem khan ne muslim samudaay main gussa bharaa hua he ki sarkaar hamaari maangon ko manjuuri nahin de rahi he
 We do not want the atmosphere to be polarized
 isiilie ham aarakshan ko paane ke liye kanoonee sadhano kaa paalan karenge
 He said that now through the delegation, he will meet the Chief Minister and talk to him to implement reservation for Muslims as soon as possible

 haalanki duusari taraf kaha ja rahaa he ki mayawati khud ke bajaatpane bhai anand kumaar ko rajyasabha bhejnaa chaahati hai

 Apart from this, 1 vote RLD, 1 Nishad Party and three independent votes are also included

 It is 2010
areeb Majeed, a resident of mumbai ke nikat kalyaan kaa rahane vaala arib majid navi mumbai main washi ke fadar agnells polytechnic college main diploma in civil ejineering ke paanchaven semester kaa chaatr tha
 That summer he did an internship as a trainee civil engineer in a building project in Navi Mumbai
 phir 2012 main aathven semester ke dauraan usne dakshin mumbai ke grant road par houseing project main internship kii
 Later that year, after passing his course with 77 per cent marks, he scored an a in Panvel
 aar
 Kalsekar enrolled in degree college
 is tarah dekhen to yah mumbai ke kisi upnagar ke yuva kii aam-si kahani athwa biodata ho saktaa he- ek jaisaa, madhyavargeey paidaaish se baahar nikalne kii tadap liye
 But it is not so
 ab 23 saal ke ho chuke arib ne mumbai main neshnal investigeshan agency (enie) se poochtacha ke dauraan bataaya, ‘‘maine may 2014 main degree college chhod diya or iraq ke liye ravaanaa ho gaya
 "then, leaving Mumbai from India on 24 May, and returning to India on 28 November, Arib continued to fight in Iraq, Syria and Turkey as a jihadist of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), firing bullets, dying
 Was also declared, survived the aerial bombardment, survived two fidayeen attacks and then felt that he had lived a lot as a jihadi
 yah bhartiya jehadi kii kahani he
 He told this story to the interrogators in the NIA - which is now India Today
 majahabi dikshwarib kii paidaaish kalyaan ke muslim bahul madhyavargeey ilaake ansaari chowk ke unke pushtaini makaan main hui thi
 Then in 2007 he reached the slightly better Sarvodaya Residency in Kalyan (west)
 uske unani doctor pita ejaj majid apane bacchon ko behatar jindagi dena chaahate the
 Areeb passed tenth from Luards High School in 2008 with 83 per cent marks
 uskaa dharm kii taraf jhukaav kishoravastha main hi ho gaya tha-2005 main jab vah aathvin main padhata tha to vah ek sthaneey masjid main mishaal bhai naam ke shaks ke sampark main aayaa, jo students islamic orgenigeshan (esaio) kii kalyaan ikai kaa pramukh hone kaa daawa karata tha
 Areeb first visited sio's office in May 2005 and quickly became a member
 agle hi maheene esaio ne mumbai ke nikat chote-se hill stesan matheran ke liye do din kaa trip yojit kiya
 Areeb became quite religious after the trip
 jaanchakartaaon kaa kahana he ki islam main uski shuruaati dilchaspee main isane ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Areeb says that the President of the Islamic Research Foundation of Mumbai and an international opinion lecturer, Dr
 jakir nike ke vyaakhyaan sunne ke baad uske man main islam ke bare main or padhgaye kii dilchaspee jaagi
 It was around this time that the ardent Muslim within him was replaced by the ardent Muslim
 janvari 2013 main uske college janaa shuru karne ke baad iageies ke iraq or syria main khilaafat sthapit karne kii khabaren aani shuru ho gayi
 Soon his Facebook account became attached to this content
 arib ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe un fasebuk pej se jude profile ke sampark bhi mili
 But none of them were helping me
 maine australia, turki, saudi arab, iraq, america
 
 
 i tried to talk to many people, but all those people used to say that first get to Turkey
 ’’vah iageies or jehad ke bare main online video dekhne ke saath-saath kaaphi gaharaai se padhgaye bhi laga
 The lesson of Hadith, which decisively led Arib to Syria, was, in which, when a Sahabi (companion) asked the Prophet where he should go for Hijrat (migration), he got the answer, "go to Syria
" ’’ ek mushkil thi-na to vah akelaa ja saktaa tha or na hi bina kisi thos sampark ke
 Jamaat and Yojana When Areeb's idea of joining ISIS floated, he remembered his friend Fahd Sheikh, whom he had met a few months earlier in the area's mosque
 donon main jald hi gadhi dosti ho gai thi-online bhi or asaliyat main bhi
 Fahd studied mechanical engineering from Nagpada College in South Mumbai
 arib kaa kahana tha ki fahd ko islam kii gahari jaankaree thi
 In February 2014, Areeb revealed his plans to Fahd
 fahd ne bataaya ki uske do anya dost-sahim tankhi or amaan tandil bhi iageies main shaamil hona chaahate hai
 a fifth man had also initially shown interest but reportedly later backed out
 syria jane ke raste kii 2013 se hi talash kar rahe arib ko pataa tha ki sabase aasaan tarika turki ke raste hi jane kaa tha
 In March 2014, he reached the welfare office of travel operator Thomas Cook in search of visas for countries bordering Syria
 use pataa chalaa ki turki kaa 11 din kaa puraa package prati vyakti 80,000 ru
 Was very expensive
 phir aglaa adnga un dastavejon ko lekar bhi laga, jo vija ke liye jaruri the-chah maheene ke bank statement, selleri slip or passport
 All papers were required to be submitted a month before the journey
 lihaaja turki to yojana se baahar hua
 They started working on Plan b arib kaa kahana tha, ‘‘internet par mujhe sabase aasaan tarika iraq or vahaan se syria jane kaa najar aayaa
 "in the meantime, he also came to know that anyone can go to Iraq on a Ziarat visa, which does not require any documents
 arib ko raahat tours naam ke ek travel oparator kaa pataa chalaa jo uske liye sabhi kharch milakar prati vyakti 60,000 ru
 Was providing a return package of Rs
 unhone paisa kishton main adaa kiya
 When the path was found, Areeb approached a Palestinian woman named Tahira Bhatt, who was introduced to her through social networking sites
 arib ne usase madad ke liye baghdad main kisi sampark ke bare main poocha
 But most people did not want to express themselves, so they got in touch with an Abu Fatima in Mosul just 10 days before leaving
 enie ne jo poochtacha arib se kii, uski report main arib ke tahiraa se nikaah ke kayaason ko bhi khaarij kar diya gaya he
 Areeb said, "(with ISIS) i finished talking to Tahira over the phone when my training was over and we decided to marry
" kuch din baad maine iraq main ek fidain mishan par jane kaa faisla kar liya
 He too chose a way to do the same in Palestine
 ham jaanate the ki ham marane vaale hai, lekin usne philstin jane se pehle apni fasebuk profile ko apadet karke yah likh diya ki uskaa arib majid se nikaah ho chukaa he
 Its purpose was to entice more and more Indians to send a "friend request" so that they could help them come to Syria in response
 ‘‘lekin hamaara nikaah kabhi nahin hua tha
 "on the 24th of Baghdad and Mosulmai, he left home around eleven thirty in the morning

 Areeb reported to his father over the phone from Abu Dhabi Airport the next morning that he was going to Syria for hijrat
 uske abba ne use lautne ke liye raji karne kii har mumkin koshish kii lekin vah nahin mana
 They reached Baghdad in the afternoon on 25 May

 The four then decided to go to Iraq's second largest city, Mosul
 mosul main unka pehla din 1 june barbaad gaya
 After that he got a message from Fatima: After the afternoon prayers, wait in the Sabunji Mosque
 intjaar ke dauraan sena ke logon ne unhen pakad liya kyonki un sabhi ke paas bag the or jahiraa taur par ve baahar se aae lag rahe the
 They took him to the headquarters for questioning
 do ghante baad unhen chhod diya gaya
 "as soon as we came out, Abu Fatima approached me and asked us to return to the gate of the mosque again and wait
" jald hi ek safed hundai car main do log vahaan pahunche
 The driver who asked us to sit in the car told his name as Ali
 ’’bees minute kii drive ke baad ve mosul ke bahari ilaake main ali ke ghar pahunche
 Areeb reports that Ali, the father of three children, lives in a luxurious duplex house
 ‘‘usne hamaare baigon kii talaashi lee, hamaare phone se sim card nikaal die or mere samsung note-1 ko chhodkar baaki saare phone le liye
 "areeb was allowed to keep a phone without a SIM card to use Google Translator because very few people knew English there

 "they stayed in Yusuf's house for four more days, that is, until June 6, and all requests for a recommendation were rejected
" ek maukey par to ali ne unhen bharat lautne tak kii salaah de di
 Areeb said that as a last way, Ali spoke to the Chechen fighter and military commander of Iraq and Syria, Omar Shishani

 "I decided to go on a suicide attack
" 3 agast ko main ek minibas main iraq gaya
 However, there was no suicide attack
 usee der raat, arib ko iraq ke baj shahar par america hawaii hamalon main taang main chot lagi

 Rishi Kapoor has returned to India after battling a serious illness
 ve apni shandaar acting ke saath hi saath apane bebaak bayanon ke liye bhi jane jate hai
 He has recently expressed his views on the treatment of artists
 rishi kapur ne ieenes se baatcheet main kaha, 'hamaare desh kii sarkaar jis hisaab se desh ke artists ke saath bartaav karti he, usase main behad khafa hum
 India is a country which is recognized around the world for its music, culture and cinema, but the artists of our country are treated with second-rate status
 desh main banane vaali zyaadaatar nai sadaken, fliovers, airports par bharat ke rajanetaaon ke naam par hote hai
 After all, why are these public places not named after artists? ”he said,“ In our country, there are great artists like Pandit Ravi Shankar, Ustad Alla Rakha Khan, Lata Mangeshkar ji
 raaj kapur, prithviraj kapur jaise artists rahe hai, ye main isliye nahin kah rahaa hum kyonki main raaj kapur ke khandaan se taalluk rakhata hum par kya cinema main in sitaron ke yogadan ko bhulaayaa ja saktaa he? in logon ke yogadan ko puri duniya main celebratt kiya jaataa he lekin hamaare hi desh main aisa nahin hota he
 Why the hell? 'view this post on instagrama post shared by Rishi Kapoor (@rishikapoorofficial) onjun 7, 2014 at 12:47 am PDT' Worldwide artists are respected, why not in India? 'he said' Elvis in America There are many artists like Presley, Michael Jackson who have many public places named after them and the Young Generation of America knows about these stars but in our country everything is named after the politician
 hamaare desh main estronaut kalpana chawla jaisi mahilaayein bhi hai jinhone duniya bhar main bharat kaa naam roshan kiya he or ve kai logon ke liye prerana he lekin desh ke rajaneta apane agenda ke tahat public place ko sirf netaaon ke naam par rakhte hai
 Until we make these people popular and places like public places like airport, road, school, college will not be named after these inspiring stars, then how will the future generations know about the contribution of these celebrities? ' mandsaur andolan ke dauraan maare gaye kisaanon or pradesh main kisaanon kii durdasha ko lekar congressi saansad jyotiraditya sindhiya ne bhopal main 72 ghante kaa anshan shuru kar diya he
 Jyotiraditya Scindia, former Union Minister of Congress and MP, blamed the state government for the Mandsaur firing, saying that Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan did not fast, but ridiculed the farmers

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator Today, the number of children suffering from asthma is not less
 jiskaa sabase bada kaaran bacchon kii kharaab dincharya or vaataavaran main badhata pradooshan bhi he
 Small children are vulnerable to this disease at an early age
 jo ki kaaphi chintajanak he
 It is said that in the changing season, asthma patients need to pay more attention to themselves
 ek nai study ke anusaar, agar asthma ke marij apni diet main vitamin di kii maatra thik rakhte hai to wo aasaani se badalte mausam main bhi bina kisi takalif ke apana dhyaan rakh sakate hai
 According to a new study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, low vitamin d in the diet can greatly aggravate the problem of children with asthma
 study ke anusaar jin bacchon main vitamin di kii kami hoti he, unki sehat par cigarette or candal tak kaa dhuaan baaki bacchon kii tulana main zyada nakaaratmak asar daalata he
 Let us tell you, 120 students with asthma were included in the study
 is adhyayan main 3 chizon par vishesh dhyaan diya gaya- ghar main vaayu pradooshan kaa str, khun main vitamin di kii maatra, or asthma ke lakshan
 By the way, it is also important to know that many of the 120 children were also obese
 is study main jo parinaam nikalakar aae, unase pataa chalaa ki agar aapke ghar main vaayu pradooshan zyada he lekin asthma se peedit bachche ke sharir main vitamin di kii acchhee maatra he, to usko is vaataavaran main saamanjasy baitaane main zyada takalif nahin hogi
 On the other hand, if proper amount of vitamin d is given to the children who are obese, then there will be more extensive changes in them
 study main is baat par bhi jor diya gaya he ki dhoop main zyada der baithne se asthma se peedit bacchon ko vitamin di to mil jayega, lekin unki skin par iskaa kharaab asar pad saktaa he
 The study said that instead of taking vitamin d from the sun, if the child gets fish, mushrooms, orange juice, then deficiency of vitamin d in his body can be accomplished without any side effects
 vaise study kii mukhya shodhakarta sonaali bose kahati hai, 'asthma ek aisi beemaari he jiskaa koi sthaayee ilaaj sambhav nahin he
 But it has been learned from many studies that vitamin d can not control the diseases related to respiratory but it can be controlled
 'to agar aapke bachche ko bhi asthma kii samasya he to uski diet main vitamin di kii maatra badha den, thode samay main sakaaratmak parivartan dikhnaa shuru ho jayega
 The examination of the politicians was completed and the results were also revealed
 paas yaa fail jo bhi hua saamne aa chukaa he lekin bacchon ke liye abhi bhi raahat nahin he
 His board exam is still pending
 to hamane sochaa ki itane tension ke bich kyon nahin thodaa hansi mazaaq kar liya jaae

Every member of the Bigg Boss household knows how important it is to follow the rules of the house
 lekin is sab ke baavjood aise kai maukey aate hai, jab ghar ke sadsy in niyamon ko taak par rakh dete hai
 Bigg Bosses also give warnings from time to time
 lekin chetavanee kaa phayda na hota dekh, big bos ne sakht kadam uthaane kaa faisla kiya he
 In the wake of breaking the rules, Bigg Boss decides to keep the kitchen closed for 24 hours
 big bos ne ghar ke sadasyon ko english main baat karne se manaa kiya tha
 Normally the rule breakers include Tanisha and Armaan, Gauhar and Kushal
 ye log lite jalane ke baad bhi english bolte rahete hai or kai baar unke mikes bhi utre hue mili hai
 Members of the house were also talking about the nomination process among themselves, which is wrong
 isi kii vajah big bosa ne 24 ghante ke liye ghar kii rasoi band kar di
 The urge to go abroad
 vahaan rahakar paisa kamaaneki chaah
 Normally, this dream is seen by every youth of India
 magar ise saakaar karnaa sabake bas kii baat nahin
 The process of working abroad is so difficult that in order to complete its formalities, people lay down their arms
 baavjoodisake bharat ke hazaron log ek sunahare bhavishya kaasapana lekar videshon main kaam karne jate hai
 Getting a visa for work in Europe and the United States is crooked
 lekin khadi deshon main dakshin asian deshon ke logon ko kaam milane main aasaani rahati he
 This is the reason why thousands of people from India turn to Gulf countries for work
 magar pareshaani tab hoti he jab ye kisi islamic kanoon ke ulanghan main pakade jate hai
 Now the question is why Indian citizens are caught more there? There are many reasons for this
 ek to vahaan kaa sakht islamic kanoon or doosraa gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se vahaan kaam karnaa yaa rahanaa
 Generally, the Indians who go there are not aware of Sharia
 or ve jane-anjaane main uske aadhaar par banaae gaye kanoon kaa ulanghan kar baithte hai
 In the Gulf, these Indians, who have faced the law, also include people who go to their relatives or acquaintances who already work there
 anpadh yaa kam padhaa-likhaa hona unke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban jaataa he
 Since there the sign boards are written in English and Arabic, which they do not understand and are caught on small mistakes
 duusari taraf aise maamle bhi kam nahin hai jinamein bhartiya, paryatak vija par vahaan jate hai or gaiyr kanoonee tareeke se kisi bhi jagah kaam karne lagate hai
 They are caught and put in jail
 aise donon tarah ke maamalon main bhartiya duutavaason ke saamne do tarah kii chunauti hoti he
 Those who have been committing crimes unknowingly, are requested by the governments there, but the cases of those who are working there illegally get complicated
 videsh mantralay kii ek report ke mutabik bharat se baahar rahane vaale 2 karod 19 lakh pravasi bharatiyon main se 27 fisadi khadi deshon main kaam kar rahe hai
 a large number of whom are of the working class
 duniya ke 68 deshon kii jelon main band bharatiyon kii sabase badi taadaad bhi khadi deshon main he
 Of the total Indians lodged in foreign jails, 45 percent are in Gulf countries
 islamic kanoon ke ullaghann, chori, dhokhadhadi or gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se kaam karne yaa gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se vahaan rahane ke aarope main khadi ke 8 deshon main bhartiya naagarik band hai
 There are 1,469 in jails in Saudi Arabia and 822 in the United Arab Emirates
 jabaki bahrain, iraq, kuwait, oman, katar or yaman kii jelon main 2,906 bhartiya naagarik sazaa kaat rahe hai
 Families of Indians serving their sentences in prisons keep circling the embassies and the Indian Ministry of External Affairs to get them released, with the hope that they will one day return

 atali (atlee) ko unke skin color kii vajah se trol karne par bura lag rahaa he
 Priya (attlee's wife) must be feeling proud that today her husband has reached the pinnacle of progress that he is getting a chance to sit next to Shahrukh Khan

 In Jammu and Kashmir, once again there has been debate about Article 35A
 isi ke bich jammu-kashmir kii mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti guuruuvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi se dilli main mulaakaat karengi
 BJP sources say that Article 35A was not a part of both parties' Common Minimum Program

 Article 35A of the Constitution was discussed in the meeting of the two leaders

 Article 35A empowers the Jammu and Kashmir government and the legislative assembly to decide the definition of permanent resident
 iskaa matlab he ki rajya sarkaar ko ye adhikaar he ki wo aazaadee ke vakt duusari jagahon se aae sharnaarthiyon or anya bhartiya nagarikon ko jammu-kashmir main kis tarah kii sahuliyatein de athwa nahin de

 When Uddhav Bal Thackeray is sworn in as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra at Shivaji Park in Mumbai, Balasaheb Thackeray's years-old dream will be transformed into reality
 isi ke saath hi thakare khandaan kaa pehla shaks maharashtra kii satta par kabiz hoga
 However, before the fulfillment of this dream, many principles of friendship were broken
 do bhaaiyon ke bich diwaar khadi hui
 a time came before Bala Saheb when he had to choose between his son and his nephew
 uddhav thakare saamne aane vaali baadhaon ko raundte gaye or ab mahaj kuch vakt ke faasale ke baad ve maharashtra ke siem honge
 raj-uddhav's pair used to speak of Balasaheb in Maharashtra
 us dauraan uddhav or raaj unke do sipahasaalar the
 Uddhav and Raj were cousins
 uddhav siyasat se khinche-khinche rahete the, unka photography main man lagata, lekin raaj thakare dabang or mukhar the
 People used to see the image of uncle Bal Thackeray in them
 raaj thakare teji se shivasainikon ke bich lokapriy hote ja rahe the
 In 2002, when the Shiv Sena won the BMC elections, Balasaheb Thackeray made Uddhav the executive president of the Shiv Sena in 2003
 vahiin is chunaav main raaj thakare kii sifarish vaale logon ke tikat kaat diye gaye
 In 2004, Uddhav was declared the president of the Shiv Sena
 haalanki unhone shivesna kaa adhyaksh pad aupchaarik rup se saal 2013 main sambhala tha
 Read: Wife's tweet on Fadnavis's resignation - i will come back
 
 
 mausam jaraa badalane deidhar raaj thakare ke man main khatas badhati ja rahi thi
 Finally in 2006, the time came when Raj Thackeray split from Matoshree
 unhone maharashtra navnirmaan sena naam se alag party bana lee
 However, Uddhav says that he never asked Raj Thackeray to leave Matoshree
 farvari 2012 main mumbai BMC kaa chunaav jeetne ke baad uddhav ne kaha tha, "maine kabhi usko jaao
 
 
 Did not say so 
 
 wo khud apane aap chalaa gaya he
 
 
 Therefore, the question of returning should not be asked to me
 "dur hue do dostiye ek baar phir se 2019 main aate hai
 When the Maharashtra election results came out on October 24, Uddhav Thackeray saw a hope in it
 uddhav ko laga ki maharashtra main thakare raaj ke aagaaj kaa isse behatar mauka ho hi nahin saktaa he
 Uddhav Thackeray cited the promise given to Bala Saheb to the BJP and put a condition of 50-50 formula in front of him
 bijepi ke liye ye sab apratyaashit tha
 The Shiv Sena had rebelled several times in the last five years, but each time it returned after a few minutes, some compromises
 lekin is baar uddhav the ki tus se mas nahin ho rahe the
 His only condition was CM post
 2014 main bijepi ne chhina bade bhai kaa roledarasal uddhav thakare ko pichley paanch saal se ye malaal tha ki 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne usase bala sahib thakare kii viraasat chin lee thi
 The remote control of politics in Maharashtra, which used to be in Matoshri, now went under BJP control
 2014 ke chunaav main uddhav ke netritv main shivasena ne apane dam par chunaav ladaa tha lekin unki party 63 siten hi jeet pai
 Whereas BJP got 122 seats and Shiv Sena lost the key to power
 tut gai 30 saal puraani dostilekin is baar ke nattejey kuch aise the kibijapi ke liye shivasena kaa sackprihaary tha
 Just Uddhav openly expressed his ambition
 uddhav kii ye mahatvakanksha bijepi-shivasena ke bich siyaasi dushmani main badal gai
 The question was of 30 years of friendship
 vichaardhaara se itar jane kaa tha
 But Uddhav was adamant
 unhone dhara ke vipareet chalanaa sweekaar kiya, lekin is baar unhen singhaasana har haal main chahie tha
 After all, with some chatter and some twitching, the bjp-shiv Sena's years-old friendship broke down
 28 november ko uddhav thakare siem banane ja rahe hai

 Hospitals said that the tariff rate fixed for a disease is not reasonable and hence they are unable to treat a patient under this scheme
 sarkaar jald hiayushmaan yojana ke tahat kareeb 200 bimariyon ke kharch main badhotaree karne ja rahi he, yah badhotaree 10 fisadi tak hogi
 According to Indus Bhushan, Chief Executive Officer of Ayushman Yojana, "there will be a change in the cost of about 259 diseases

 The new tariff can be announced this week
 gauratlab he ki 23 sitambar ko ayushmaan bharat yojana ko ek saal puraa hua he
 The government has adopted a new strategy this time to increase or decrease the spending limit
 ilaaj kharch main badlaav kisi beemaari ke hisaab se na karke marij ko di jane vaali dawa ke aadhaar kiya gaya he
 That is, there can be many types of diseases in one part of the body, but it is not necessary to spend the same in every disease
 kya beemaari he iskaa sabase sateek pataa is tarah hi chal saktaa he ki doctor ne marij ko kya dawa di he
 It will be clear that how much money is actually spent in treatment
 bhushan kaa kahana he, ''beete ek saal main kai tarah ke cese saamne aae
 In some diseases, if the cost of treatment was less, then they were increased
 lekin jahaan kharch tarksangat nahin the unhen kam bhi kiya gaya he
 In some situations there was duplication in the package
 nae badlaavon main in sabhi chizon kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 "the government has justified the cost of treatment for every disease, it can change if every hospital has its own way
" aapako bataa den ki ab tak ayushmaan ke antargat kareeb 18,000 aspataal hi shaamil hai
 These include both government and private hospitals
 sarkaar kii ore se ilaaj kharch ke tarriff main badlaav ke baad kya aspataal is skim ke daayre main khud ko laaenge yaa duuri banaae rakhenge yah nae tarriff ke aane ke baad hi pataa chalegaa

 What is the state of sports in Jharkhand, it is not hidden from anyone
 bhale hi pradesh main rashtriya khelon ke dauraan vishwastareey suvidha vaale stadium banaaye jane kii baat kahi gayi ho, lekin khelon ke prati sarkari udaseenta kii vajah se stadium behaal hai

 Surprisingly, when the lightning struck, the chief guest was present on the stage at the time, including Sports Minister Geetashree Oraon, Sports Secretary Vandana Dadel, Director Ashok Kumar, Indian Athletics Team Head Coach Bahadur Singh among others

 There was an atmosphere of chaos in the entire stadium due to the loss of electricity
 jab kaaphi intjaar ke baad bhi bijli nahin aayi, to kareeb 45 minute baad aayojakon ne torch or mobile kii roshni main samaaroh sampann karaane kaa faisla kiya

 19 sitambar 2008 kii subah bottla house main hua tha encountercontrovarsi se lekar raajnneeti tak sab kuch hua is encounter parais encounter ko lekar ajtak ne ED ke purv diarector se baatcheet19 sitambar 2008 kii subah desh kii rajdhani dilli main jamiya nagar ilaake ke bottla house main encounter hua
 It has been 11 years since the encounter, but the politics still heats up on it
 controvarsi se lekar raajnneeti tak sab kuch hua he is encounter par
 Aaj Tak talked to former ED director and Joint Commissioner Karnail Singh during the Batla House encounter regarding this encounter
 pehali baar unhone is encounter se jude kai khulaase kiye hai
 What was the pressure during the Batla House encounter? How was the attempt to divide the team of Special Cell? How did every evidence of an encounter have to be given amidst political rhetoric? All aspects were discussed
 padhein unhone kya kaha-gujarat police ko mila tha suraaggujarat main 26 july2008main blast hua tha
 The Gujarat Police investigated the leads they got from the intelligence agencies and shared them with the police of all the states
 jaankaree dilli police se bhi share kii gai
 When those leads were developed, in which the main work was by Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma, it went to a phone number that it could be invoiced
 lead ke aadhaar par bottla house main mohan chand sharma kii team ne search oparation kiya lekin is dauraan encounterhua
 The Leeds that got after the encounter had a complete Indian Mujahideen module that slowly collapsed
 encounter ko farji bataaya gaya!encounter par controvarsi hui
 Those who have implications, they always try to create contrast and it was done at that time also
 ek work pressure tha ki aapako samajhaana he
 People were suspicious
 unakoklear karnaa tha ki nahin aisa nahin tha, jo special cell kii team ne karke bhi dikhaaya
 This was also cleared in the legal scrutiny
 kaam special cell kii team ne kiya uske baad jo lead mili wo intelligence agency se share kii gai or uske baad kai safaltaaen milin
 For example, on 26 September, the Mumbai Police busted another module of the Indian Mujahideen
 alag-alag rajyon kii police ko bhi safaltaaen milin
 All this proved that the people who were caught in Batla House were the people of Indian Mujahideen and they had blasted many places
 bottla house par hui siyasat!netaaon ke alaava kuch activist the jinka kaam hi he police ke ection kaa virodh karnaa
 But the truth does not change
 hamaare inspector mohan chand sharma or unki team ek close net team thi
 This was not the first time that the team had caught a terrorist or had an encounter
 team ne kashmir main bhi oparation kiya tha
 It is wrong to accuse such a team and it was wrong to try to divide the team among themselves
 mohan ko aatankwaadi kii goli lagi, aatankwaadiko bhi goli lagi, vahaan 2 aatanki maare gaye or 2 bhaag gaye
 One was also caught from there, if the leads received further, the truth does not change and the truth was that Mohan Chand Sharma was shot by a terrorist
 team main koun daalana chaahate the foot!bahut se log the, kuch activist the jinka naam abhi main yahaan nahin lenaa chaahunga
 Do you know the leaders who spoke on TV
 ab us vivaad main jane kaa koi phayda nahin
 11 years of court cases
 enechaarasine jaanch kii, hai court, supreme court main yachikaayen daali gayi lekin sab jagah jeet sach kii hai
 The Indian Mujahideen became weak because of the work the team did
 har blast ke baad i-mail aate the
 In the mail that came after UP Court Blast, Jaipur Blast, Gujarat Blast, he said that our men are safe and in every email they threatened the policemen that we will not leave you
 bottla house ke baad kya hua? koun sa i-mail aayaa? koun si dhamkee ai? ye ishaara karata he ki aatankwaadiyon kii raftaar kam hui or bahut saare log pakade bhi gaye
 a National Policy on Terrorism should be a National Policy on Terrorism
 chaahe wo kisi party kii sarkaar ho, use neshnal policy banani chahie
 It should apply to every political person
 tabhi ham ek hokar aatankwaad ke khilaaf yuddh kar sakate hai
 Otherwise, whatever the team is investigating, there is unnecessary pressure on them and their work gets hampered
 haryana ke baad ab rajasthan main jameen kaa khel saamne aayaa he
 Robert Vadra is accused of breaking the law to buy land in Bikaner district of Rajasthan
 robert wadra kii jameen kharid kaa masalaa isliye gambhir sawaal uthaata he ki rajasthan sarkaar ne bhoomi kanoon tak badal diya
 Is it good luck for Vadra to earn a hefty profit from the land purchased at a quarter of the price or is the information given by the government astonished
 rajasthan ke bikaner jile main banjar jameen se robert wadra ko phayda pahunchaa
 Even though Robert Vadra bought hundreds of acres of land just before the amendment to the Land Ceiling Actor, Aaj Tak has highlighted the case of four transactions in which 321
 78 acre jameen lee gayi, jabaki ijaajat to sirf 175 acre jameen rakhane kii hi he
 321 before September 2010
 8 acre jameen kharidi gayi
 Under the Rajasthan Land Ceiling Act, a maximum of 175 acres of land was allowed before September 2010
 bikaner jile ke koyalat ilaake ke basti chounan gaanv main wadra ke frontman mahesh nagar ne 2009 main 218 acre jameen kharidi
 Nagar made all the deals for Robert Vadra in the Kolayat area of bikaner
 9 april, 2009 ko real arth ystats privet limited kii taraf se mahesh nagar ne 218 acre jameen kharidi
 Nagar's relationship with Vadra was that he was the director of Real Earth Private Limited
 vikreta avijit agro privet limited ke vineet asopa rahe
 The measles number of the ground is 58, 63
 4 june 2009 ko wadra ne gajner gaanv main 36 acre se zyada jameen kharidi
 Land deal documents show here that Mahesh Nagar bought this land on behalf of Blue Breeze Private Trading Limited
 is company main wadra kaa naam bataur diarector he
 Mahesh Nagar 36 on behalf of Blue Breeze Private Trading Limited
 87 acre jameen kharidi
 Here Nagar had a relationship with Vadra that he was the director of Blue Breeze Private Trading Limited
 jameen kaa khasra number 657 / 445 tha
 On June 12, 2009, Vadra took another 39 acres in Gajner village itself
 mahesh nagar ne blue briz trading kii taraf se ye jameen kharidi
 The measles number is 660 / 445
 lekin nagar to sirf dastakhat karne ke liye adhikrut tha, naa ki wo jameen kaa maalik
 Robert Vadra is the major stakeholder in the two land deals he was representing in the land deal, namely Real Earth and Blue Breeze
 masalan, real arth main wadra ke paas 99 fisadi equity he, jabaki baaki ek fisadi equity unki maa maurin ke paas he
 According to the website of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Blue Breeze Trading Private Limited has only two shareholders - Robert and his mother Maureen
 company ke asli maalik wadra hai
 a large part in the real sense is in the name of Robert Vadra (99%)
 unki maa maurin wadra ke paas 1% he
 Aaj Tak has a copy of a check issued in the name of MS Real Earth Estates Private Limited, signed by Robert Vadra
 jameen kharidne ke liye die gayi ye check sabit karte hai ki apane frontman mahesh nagar ke jariye sara kaam wadra kara rahe the
 On 9 April 2009, an amount of Rs 91,50,000 was paid to Avijit Agro (owner Vineet Asopa)
 check number tha 759382 or is par robert wadra ke sin the
 On 9 April 2009 Sarita Bothra (the mistress of the plot near Vineet Asopa) was paid 8,50,000 through check number 759384
 is par bhi wadra ke hi sin the
 Aaj Tak sought Robert Vadra frontman Mahesh Nagar till Faridabad
 pehle to unhone ajtak se baatcheet karne kaa vaada kiya, lekin baad main mukar gaye
 The transaction is a clear violation of the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973
 kyonki wadra ne april 2009 main 175 acre jameen rakhane kii adhiktam seemaa ko paar kiya
 Vadra purchased more than 321 acres of land between April 2009 and August 2010
 ye rajasthan impojishan of ceiling on agricultural holdings act, 1973 kaa ulanghan tha
 In the desert and semi-desert areas, land ceiling for Vadra was drawn to the maximum extent
 kanoon ke mutabik, registani or ardh registani ilaakon main 125 se 175 acre jameen rakhane kii ijaajat he
 The Ashok Gehlot government appears guilty in two ways
 pehle jab 2009 main wadra rajasthan main jameen kharid rahe the, tab use nazarandaaj kar diya
 And now bought the land, then amended the Land Act and gave it legal validity
 wadra ke liye badla kanoon?sitambar 2010 main rajya sarkaar ne teen dashak se bhi zyada puraane kanoon main sanshodhan kiya
 Also finished the sealing on the ground
 sanshodhan main sabhi puraane adhigrahan ko sahi tehraane ke liye jaruri niyam jod diye gayi, taaki us ilaake main wadra zyada se zyada jameen kharid saken
 While the Congress-ruled state government changed the Land Ceiling Act to legalize Vadra's violations, she also sat on a solar policy for nearly three years
 ye wo daur tha, jab wadra ne is ilaake main bada land bank taiyaar kar liya
 Jackpot on the barren land, April 2009 - Vadra started buying land in Kolayat area
 november 2009- centre kaa jawaharlal nehru neshnal solar mishan shuru
 2009 - Center directs states to make land banks for solar energy projects
 2009 se 2011 ke bich wadra ne saikadon acre jameen kharid lee
 April 2011 - Solar policy of Rajasthan government started
 jahaan solar projects kaa prastaav aayaa, vahaan kii banjar jameen bhi mahangi ho gayi
 And this is where the story begins about how Vadra made a big profit in Bikaner
 unhone bikaner ke kolayat ilaake main 81
 After purchasing 35 acres of land, he sold it to Fonroche Saaras, an indo-french company that started solar power projects at six times the price
 sirf isi ek tranjaction se wadra ne 612 fisadi laabh kamaaya
 Within two years, the price of land increased by six times

 Kahili of the state government helped Vadra to build a land bank around the solar centers
 -bikaner kshetra main solar kendron kii jaankaree sirf rajya sarkaar or centre ko thi
 There was a provision in the state's solar policy to provide land at a concessional rate
 -rajya sarkaar ne riyayati dar par jameen bechney kaa prastaav rakhaa, magar rajya sarkaar kii adhigrahit jameen ko kharidne koi nahin aayaa
 - The reason for this was the distance of the government acquired land from the transmission hubs
 isliye kuch bade sawaal khadey hote hai--kya mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne bikaner main jameen kharidne ke liye wadra se saath-ganth kii
 - Did the state government change the Land Ceiling Act so that the deal of Vadra who bought land beyond the prescribed limit could be legally justified
 -kya jameen kharidne se pehle hi wadra ko us ilaake main solar power projects aane kii jaankaree mil gayi thi
 Why did the government fail to create a land bank in three years

 It is being alleged that the Congress governments deliberately committed disturbances
 vahiin congress kisi bhi aniyamitata se inkaar kar rahi he
 On Thursday, Delhi Law Minister Jitendra Singh Tomarne wrote a letter to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on his ongoing controversy over the law saying that the allegations of degree forgery are 'baseless' and aimed to 'tarnish' the image of him and the party
 tomars ne bhaajapa netaa nand kishor garg ko dhamkee di ki naam badnaam karne ke liye vah unke khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa darj karaayenge
 Garg has challenged the authenticity of Tomar's degrees in the court
 kejariwal ne gat mangalvaar ko tab tomars se is maamle par apana ruukh spasht karne ke liye kaha tha jab bihar kii tilka maanjhi bhagalpur vishvavidhyalay ne dilli hai ko bataaya ki dilli ke kanoon mantri jitendra singh tomars kaa lau kii degree jaali he or iskaa santhaan main koi record nahin he
 Tomar said in his letter to Kejriwal, 'as it was becoming clear that he (nand Kishore Garg) would lose his seat (in the assembly elections), he started resorting to dirty tricks to discredit my name
 jab laga ki kuch bhi kaam nahin kar rahaa he, unhone hai court main ek chunavi yachika daayar karke meri snaatak or vidhi kii digriyon kii pramanikta par sawaal uthaae
 Tomar claimed that the documents provided by Garg were 'wrong'
 unhone kaha, ‘garg dilli or himachal pradesh main kuch vishvavidhyalay chalaate hai or anya vishvavidhyalayon se apane sampark ke chalate unhone galat vivaran kaa hawala dete hue kuch dastavej praapt kar liye
 These erroneous documents are mentioned as evidence in the election petition

 a team from Special Cell has busted an international drug cartel involved in the import, reorganization and distribution of Afghan heroin, seizing about 150 kg of Afghan heroin
 antarrashtriya str par isaki keemat lagbhag 600 karod rupee he
 The revelations have revealed a horrifying picture of the spice trade between India and Afghanistan, and the use of it as a cover by international drug syndicates
 oparation kaa paimaana isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki bharat main heroin ke punargathan or prakiya kii dekharekh ke liye afghanistan ke jalalabad ke rasinic visheshgyon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 These included jute bags, which were used to transport cumin and other domestic spices from Afghanistan to India with heavy amounts of heroin
 har khaali jute bag vastav main heroin powder ke sookhe ghol ko apane reshe main chipa letaa
 Once the spices have been removed, every empty jute bag when processed in a fixed process will yield about 1 kilogram of high quality Afghan heroin
 vishesh cell ne rashtriya rajdhani main aatank or uske buniyadi dhaanche (jisamen bandook chalaanaa, nakli mudra or maadak padaarth shaamil hai) par najar rakhane ke liye vishesh abhiyaan chalaaya taaki sandigdh gatividhiyon par najar rakhi ja sake
 According to information received by reliable sources from the Special Cell, for the past few months, convoys of several luxury cars were regularly reported in some areas of the South Eastern District, which was not compatible with the economic condition of the area
 team ko yah bhi pataa chalaa ki in lagjri car ke kafile main aksar bharatiyon ke alaava videshi mul ke log, khaas kar afgaan or africa log aate the
 This was enough to make the team suspect
 iske baad special cell alert hui or ek oparation shuru kiya, jisamen nigaraanee or trekking shaamil thi
 It was then revealed that some people, including some foreign nationals, were in the final stages of executing some kind of industrial set-up in the extremely densely populated and urban suburbs of the Southeast District
 nigaraanee se pataa chalaa ki drug mafia lagjri sedan car ke ek bede kaa kafile main upyog kar rahaa tha
 The convoy would leave Delhi late in the night or early in the morning and would not stop until it reached Punjab and other neighboring states
 iskaa bhandaphod karne ke liye anbhavi sutron ko saavdhaneepurvak chun kar tainaat kiya gaya or gahan takneekee nigaraanee rakhi gai
 The team's hard work paid off when it was learned late evening of July 17 that the convoy would gather at a location in Lajpat Nagar and a large amount of smuggling was expected
 special cell ne turant ek badi team ko ikattha kiya or karrwai main lagaaya
 Another input was received that the convoy is expected to arrive near the ashram flyover

 View this post on instagramthe famous cockroach scene from Mr India
 My personal favorite
 For the brilliant sridevi was really scared of cockroaches
 And the kids had a great time running after her with a live cockroach
 With Sri screaming in real terror
 And i had a 'cockroach close up' too
 
 where the cockroach was sizing sridevi
 
 wondering whether to attack her or not
 How did we take a ‘cockroach close up’ ? By getting the cockroach drunk! Do you know that cockroaches love Old Monk Rum ? Seriously 
 
 
 By the way, that kid holding the live cockroach in sridevi's face? That Ahmed Khan
 
 who became one of Indian Film Industry's most famous Choreographer
 And now the Hit Director of the the Baghi franchise with Tiger Shroff

 isse pehle sitambar or aktubar 2016 main arunachal pradesh or manipur ke congress vidhayak dal ke saare ke saare netaa paala badalakar bhaajapa main aa gaye the
 As a result, the current governments in both states are basically made up of people from Congress and other parties
 inamen arunachal ke mukhyamantri pema khandu or unke manipuri samakaksh biren singh bhi shaamil hai
 In the Northeast, the favor of the saffron camp was reversed when Congress leader Hemant Biswa Sarma joined the BJP on August 29, 2015 due to disillusionment with the party
 tab se ve bhaajapa ke mahasachiv ram madhav ke saath milakar apane samparkon or dostiyon kaa istemaal congress or duusari kshetreey partiyon ke vidhayakon ko lubhaakar bhaajapa main laane ke liye kar rahe hai or purvottar main bhaajapa kii jaden jamaane kaa jariya ban gaye hai
 It all started in the third year of the first Modi government in 2016, when there was an influx of defection in favor of BJP
 us saal uttarakhand ke aath congress vidhayak purv mukhyamantri vijay kumaar bahuguna ke saath puraa laav-lashkar lekar bhaajapa ke paale main aa gaye
 Not only this, he became a minister in the BJP government formed in the state after the 2017 assembly elections
 may 2019 main aam chunaav se pehle, saal kii shuruyaat main, dalbadal kii is kavayad ne kai guna jor pakadaa
 Now that the BJP has achieved a grand mandate, the number of politicians who have left their Lashkar and bet on the winning horse is increasing
 khaskar aise vakt main jab congress duubate hue jahaaj kii tarah dikhaai de rahi he, kshetreey partiyon ke dabadabe main kami ai he or bhaajapa desh main jabardast rajnatik takat ban gai he
 The importance of the data is not even a complaint or problem to the BJP
 party netaa ise chanakya niti yaa jarurat kii raajnneeti kehete hai
 Assam Health and Finance Minister Sarma says that the defections have helped the BJP increase its presence in untouched areas like its politics in the Northeast
 pashchim bengal main november 2017 main mamata ke sahyogi mukul roy ke dalbadal ke saath vah silsilaa shuru hua, jisaki parinti is saal may ke aam chunaavon main bhaajapa ke behtareen pradarshan main hui
 Due to the massive defection in Karnataka and Goa this July, the BJP formed governments in both states
 dalbadal kii raajnneeti kii is kamyaabi ko dekhte hue tajjub nahin hoga, agar party jaldi hi tamilnadu or kerala main bhi isi kaa sahaara le
 Even in the upper house, where the BJP did not have a majority on its own, the party resorted to rebel mps to pass triple talaq and important bills like Article 370

 "we need to gain strength in the Rajya Sabha as quickly as possible," says another source
 ham jo kuch kar rahe hai, vah ek zyada badi yojana kaa hissaa he or deshhit main he
 "but is the arrival of outsiders in the interest of the party?" According to Sarma, this is in line with party president Amit Shah's goal of making the BJP an all-india party
 bahari logon ke party main aane se paidaa ashankaon ke chalate aresas ke sthaneey netaaon ko bharose main liya jaataa he
 Sarma says, "the goal of the party and the proper process of getting outsiders into the party is taken care of
" duusari party ke netaa ko party main lene se pehle uski puri chaanbin kii jaati he
 It is not that every leader desirous of joining BJP is taken into the party
 ''pichley saal ke aakhir main jab india today se khaas baatcheet main amit shah se party main bahari logon ke swaagat ke bare main poocha gaya tha, unhone kaha tha ki koi bhi party nae khun ko shaamil kiye bagaiyr jinda nahin rah sakati
 Whatever the claims of restless party leadership in the family, a large part of the party workers from the RSS and the larger Sangh Parivar are clearly unconcerned and uneasy about the bjp's defection politics
 unhen lagata he ki zyada bade naitik uddeshyon ko thode vakt ke phaaydon par qurbaan kiya ja rahaa he, jo 'mulya aadhaarit raajnneeti' par kutharaghaat he
 Says a former ABVP leader, "the arrival of many outside leaders who have become useful to the party suggests that the line between the two is politically correct and which is immoral, blurring at times

 a source close to Arun Kumar, the head of the rss's National Publicity Branch, says, "some of our activists are disturbed about the kind of defection politics they are witnessing, but we cannot ignore the fact that All this is being done with the dual purpose — to weaken the opposition and muster the legislative power necessary to pass legislation in the national interest
 '' sutara yah bhi kehete hai ki 2019 ke chunaav main bhaajapa ne vaicharik taur par majboot ummidavaaron ko tikat die the, jabaki aam dharna yah thi ki vah duusari partiyon se netaaon kaa aayaat kar rahi he

 Manoj expressed his inability to move the car, saying that there was no place
 bas yahi baat bike savaar yuvakon ko nagavar gujri
 Manoj, who was sitting on the back of the bike, came to Manoj and gave a loud lick on his cheek yuvakon or doctor manoj ke bich jhagada hone laga

 The victim's woman alleges that the person embarrassed her once by taking out her pornographic video, but the policemen repeatedly embarrassed her by watching her pornographic video in front of her
 mahila kaa aarope he ki us dauraan police thane main koi mahila police bhi nahin thi
 The aggrieved woman then went on to register her complaint, but later she met Thane Mayor Minakshi Shinde and narrated the incident
 mahayor ke mutabik- unhone thane police ayukta ko patr likhakar kaha he ki mahilaon kii shikaayat sunne or likhane ke liye mahila pulicekarmi hi honi chahie
 The comments enditivi se phone par baat karte hue mahayor ne bataaya ki unhone police ko patr likhakar vyavastha sudhaarney ke liye kaha he ki aage se phir kisi peedit mahila ke saath aisa naa ho
 She also made it clear that she did not deliberately mention the victim in her letter as she did not want her to go to the police station again in the name of investigation
 mahayor ke mutabik- vakya 15 may kaa he

 goa main bhaajapa ne congress kaa supada saaf kar diya
 In Uttarakhand, there is a close fight between the BJP and the Congress
 manipur main congress kii ekatarfa jeet hui
 One thing is clear from these results that the Congress party has suffered a setback in the assembly elections
 khaskar upi main jahaan par party ne apane 'yuvaraj' rahul gandhi ke sahare chamaatkaarik parinaam ke daawey kiye the
 In fact, the party, inadvertently, made the UP election a battle for Rahul's reputation
 jiskaa khamiyaja party or rahul gandhi donon ko bhugatna padaa
 Political analysts from opposition parties are trying to hold him responsible for this shameful performance of the party in the elections
 to congress party ke andar ek nayaa khemaa ban ho gaya
 Whose mantra is
 
 
 'rahul bachaao morcha'darasal congressi netaaon ko pehle se chaunkaane vaale nateezon kii ummid nahin thi
 The first hint of this was given by party general secretary Digvijay Singh
 saatven charan kaa chunaav khatm hone ke baad digvijay singh ne kaha tha ki agar pradesh main party jitati he to yah rahul kii jeet hogi or haar kii paristhiti main yah meri haar he
 Digvijay Singh actually gave a hint to the party leaders through this statement that after the bad results, Rahul Bachao Morcha will have to be put on
 jiskaa amal party ke har bada-chota netaa kar rahe hai
 Several party ministers along with Rahul Gandhi rallied in up's battlefield to give the best result in UP elections
 mantriyon ke is gut main kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid
 There were many big names like Union Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma, Coal Minister Sriprakash Singh Jaiswal, Jagdambika Pal, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh
 party ke liye dukhad baat yah he ki haar kii jimmedaari ke liye itane netaa saamne aa gaye, kaash chunavi prachaar ke dauraan itani jimmedaari se bhoomika nibhaai hoti to shaayad nattejey or behatar hote
 But the statements of Congressmen are part of a well thought out strategy
 kyonki agar vipakshi rahul gandhi par hamalaa karenge, to bhrashtachar virdohi maahaul main 2014 ke aam chunaav se pehle party kaa aakhri daav bhi fail ho jayega
 In such a situation, many may have to give sacrifices for this shameful defeat
 jiskaa faisla to hikeman hi karegaa
 For now, the leaders will follow their 'save Rahul' religion
 par ek kahawat he, 'naam bade or darshan chote'
 The performance of the Congress party proved this adage meaningful
 ab jab paristhitiyaan vipareet hai to in netaaon ne apana wo dharm nibhaana shuru kar diya jisaki congress party kii samskruti kaa hissaa mana jaataa he
 That is, will do anything for the high command
 haar ke baad digvijay singh media rubaru hone aae
 She did not have a smile on her face
 haar ke liye khud ko jimmedaar bataaya
 At the same time, defending Rahul Gandhi, the entire leadership of the loss burst on the local leadership
 or sanket de diya ki ve party ke mahasachiv ke pad se istipha de denge
 Sriprakash Jaiswal did something similar
 parinaamon ko chaunkaane vaala bataate hue kaha ki main is haar ke liye jimmedaar hum
 And i am ready to resign if needed
 unke hikeman bhakthi kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhone party ke liye apni jaan tak dene kii baat kar daali
 At the same time, Congress Party state president Rita Bahuguna Joshi also took responsibility for the defeat

 sutron ne kaha ki bhartiya sainikon ne na to chini sainikon ko unki naukaaen aage badhaane deen or na hi unhen sadak maarg par ek inch bhi aage badhane diya
 Because of this the Chinese troops had to return
 chini sainik is ilaake ke 'finger 4' kshetra tak pravesh kar gaye the or yahaan se unhen waapas bheja gaya
 The region remains the subject of dispute between India and China, as both countries assert their authority over the region
 sutron ne kaha ki jab bharat vaartaon ke dauraan is kshetra par apane daawey ke sambandh main apana paksh rakh rahaa tha, tab chini sena ne yahaan ek vishesh taur par pakki sadak kaa nirmaan kar diya or daawa kiya ki yah kshetra ke aksai chin kshetra kaa hissaa he
 Sources said that China had constructed a road up to the 'finger 4' area
 yah ilaaka siri jap kshetra ke tahat aata he or vaastavik niyantran rekha ke paanch kilometre bheetar he
 Entering the Indian waters at the same time has been seen as a move by the Chinese military to put psychological pressure on the Indian soldiers monitoring the area

 There is that power in electricity, which not only illuminates the house of AAP, but also changes the governments in elections
 haalia dilli chunaav iskaa bada udhaaharan he
 Now Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has come to power by promising cheap electricity, but the question is from where the electricity will come
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke arvind kejariwal par hamale chunaav baad bhi nahin ruke or desh ke pehle akshay urja conference ke dauraan unhone hamalaa bolte hue phir kaha ki jinke paas bijli nahin he, wo sasti bijli dene kaa daawa karte hai
 In view of this, the Aam Aadmi Party government has prepared a five-point agenda for Delhi
 1
 Offering subsidy on in-house solar units
 2
 Reduce tax on battery and solar equipment
 3
 Putting slums and low-income homes on the solar energy priority list
 4
 Generate solar energy at least 20 percent of the total power requirement
 5
 Planning so that people can produce and sell solar electricity
 aisa nahin he ki solar aane se grid bijli par nirbharta kam hogi or sarkaar kaa sirdard ghatega
 Rather, solar can prove to be a gift for Delhiites
 aapaki bijli ke kul kharch main ek tihaai kii kami ho sakati he
 Usually, the first argument against solar energy is that there is no land to be set up in Delhi
 lekin visheshgy maanate hai ki kejariwal sarkaar chaahe to jameen kii kami nahin hogi
 Delhi has a large number of buildings where large plants can be set up
 dilli main hi solar bijli utpaadan hoga to transmishan ghate kaa bhi sawaal nahin paidaa hoga
 DERC has worked on the net metering scheme
 yani ab agar sarkaar aapke ghar solar panel lagaati he to khapat se zyada bijli paidaa hone par wo bijli waapas grid main chali jaaegi or uskaa paisa bhi aapke bill main mines ho jayega yani aam ke aam, or guthliyon ke daam
 The biggest challenge in strategically implementing solar power in Delhi is to be expensive
 jaahir he, sabsidi is pahal main badi jarurat he or sabsidi bijli or pani ke baad philhal kejariwal sarkaar kaa sabase bada sirdard he

 ' amit shah ne twit kiya, 'aaj hindi diwas (hindi Diwas) ke avasar par main desh ke sabhi nagarikon se apil karata hum ki ham apni- apni maatrubhaasha ke prayog ko badhayen or saath main hindi bhashaa kaa bhi prayog kar desh kii ek bhashaa ke poojya baapu or louh purush sardaar patel ke swapn ko saakaar karne main yogadan den
 Congratulations to all of you on Hindi Day
 bhashaa kii saralata, sahajata or shaleenta abhivyakti ko sarthakata pradaan karti he
 Hindi has incorporated these aspects beautifully
 hindi diwas par shubhakamanaayen dete hue unhone kaha ki bharat vibhinn bhashaaon kaa desh he or har bhashaa kaa apana mahatv he parantu puure desh kii ek bhashaa hona atyant aavashyak he jo vishwa main bharat kii pahchaan bane
 Shah said that if only one language can do the work of tying the country to the door of unity, then it is the most spoken Hindi language
 aaj hindi diwas ke avasar par main desh ke sabhi nagarikon se apil karata hoon ki ham apni-apni maatrubhaasha ke prayog ko badhaaen or saath main hindi bhashaa kaa bhi prayog kar desh kii ek bhashaa ke poojya baapu or louh purush sardaar patel ke swappn ko saakaar karne main yogadan den
 Hearty greetings of Hindi Day BJP Working President JP Nadda said that Hindi is the most spoken and understood language in India, which unites all of us Indians in unity and is also our identity in the world
 unhone kaha, 'aap sabhi ko hindi diwas kii hardik shubhakamanaayen
 Let us all increase the use of Hindi in our daily lives and inspire others as well
 sardaar patel ke aalochak to ab zyada mukhar rahe nahin, lekin unke prashansak jab bhi unki tarif karnaa sharu karte hai, to desi riyasaton ko bharat sangh main milaane ke alaava patel kii tarif main zyada kuch kah nahin pate
 After this, instead of praising Patel, fans start doing evil by applying chilli-masala to Pandit Nehru and in the end add that if there was Patel in place of Nehru
 nehru kii avaanchit ninda ko hi ve patel kii tarif maan lete hai
 Such praise only shows that these fans are neither serious about Nehru nor do they have any love for Patel
 ve to bas apni baat siddh karne ke liye patel kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Just like Subhash Chandra Bose or Sardar Bhagat Singh have been used to find an excuse to condemn Mahatma Gandhi
 vaise, is saare tulanaatmak ninda kaarykram ko hawa milti he nehru or patel ke bich gambhir vaicharik matbhed se
 Both leaders themselves believed that there is a fundamental difference in their views on economic policies and the issue of communalism
 lekin donon yah bhi maanate the ki aapasi asahmati ke saath kaam karne par ve sahamat hai
 Correspondence between Nehru and Patel between 1948 and 1950 suggests that there was a period when both Nehru and Patel felt responsibly that either of them should break away from the Indian government
 or donon ne hi yah kaha ki behatar hoga ki vah khud pad tyaag de taaki doosraa behatar dhang se desh ko sambhaal sake
 Even more important, Bapu was also thinking that one of the two leaders should be discharged so that the other could run the country better
 gajab yah he ki donon netaaon ko yah anubhuti us gadhe vakt main ho rahi thi, jab janvari 1948 main mahatma gandhi apane jivan ke aakhri upwas par the or dilli sharnaarthiyon ke boj se dabi ja rahi thi
 But both leaders also knew that if they separated from each other at a time when the country is burning in the fire of religious riots, Mahatma Gandhi is sitting on a fast and a new government is just about to start
 Not only will the wrong message be sent about India all over the world, but anti-national elements will take advantage of it
 aise main tay kiya gaya ki is vivaad kaa samaadhaan mahatma gandhi se hi kara liya jaae
 In the first place, Nehru sent a draft to Gandhiji keeping his side and gave a copy to Patel
 agle din patel ne bhi thik yahi kaam kiya
 Now the decision had to be taken by the saint of Sabarmati
 yahaan yah jaanane main bhi harj nahin he ki patel ne gandhi ji ko likhe patr main kaha tha ki mere vyavhaar se agar jawaharlal or aapako dukh hota he to behatar he, ab aap mujhe mukt kar den
 At the same time, Nehru said that if the Prime Minister cannot do his work independently then he wants to leave this post
 iske alaava nehru jahaan sari dushwariyon ke baavjood baapu ke anshan ko uchit maan rahe the, vahiin patel ko yah apane hi logon par gandhiji kii kuch zyada hi sakht karrwai lag rahi thi
 Nehru's talk is attributed to Nehru's letter to the Chief Ministers, while Patel's talk was better explained in Gandhi's biography 'anmol Virasat' by his granddaughters Sumitra Kulkarni and Maulana Azad in their book 'india Wins Freedom' is
 moulana ne to yahaan tak kehete hai ki patel kaa vyavhaar gandhiji ke prati hikaarat bharaa ho gaya tha
 However, within six months of independence, the Father of the Nation had to choose one of his two warlords
 iske liye jaruri tha ki teenon log ek saath baithen or phir faisla ho
 But this meeting never happened
 yah mulaakaat 31 janvari 1948 ko tay kii gai thi, lekin uske ek din pehle hi mahatma kii hatya kar di gai
 Yes, one thing did happen that Patel met Gandhiji on the day of the murder and the two spent almost an hour together
 isi mulaakaat main gandhi ji ne patel se kaha ki maujuuda halaat main donon main se kisi ko bhi hataanaa sambhav nahin he
 You both have to work together
 yah baat khud patel ne nehru ko bataai
 Bapu's murder changed the situation forever
 3 farvari 1948 ko nehruji ne sardaar ko patr likhaa, ‘ab baapu ke swargvaas ke baad har baat badal gai he or ab hamen bilkul bhinn or adhik vikat sansar kaa saamana karnaa he
 Old disputes and quarrels are no longer important
 yah aavashyak takaza he ki ham sab or adhik nikat aakar sahyogpurvak kaam karen
 Of course there is no other route
 ’ isi patr main nehru ne kaha ki jab bhi koi vivaad hoga to donon aapas main lambii baatcheet kar kisi nattejey par pahunchaa karenge
 Two days later, what Patel wrote in the reply letter is complimentary, 'the affection and warmth expressed in the letter has had a profound effect on me - in fact they have overwhelmed me
 ’donon netaaon ne apane sarvocch netaa kii baat maan lee
 And how much of its importance is found in the dialogue between the two till Patel's death
 march 1950 main purvi bengal (ab bangladesh) main jari hinsa se nehru itane vyathit the ki unhone apane pad se istipha dene kaa man bana liya
 Apart from Patel, he also informed Rajendra Prasad
 lekin yahaan ek baar phir patel ne farvari 1948 ke patron kaa zikr kiya or nehruji ko donon ke rishton ke bare main baapu kii aakhri vasiyat kaa hawala diya
 Both were bound by the last decree of the Father of the Nation and both remained together
 lekin kya vaicharik virodh ke baavjood paraspar sammaan se bhari do bade netaaon kii kahani un aalochakon kii samaj main aegi, jinka khokhla rashtrawaad nakaar par khadaa he
 It would be better if they try to understand the meaning of nationalism not only with Nehru or with Patel
 aisa karne main shaayad ve bina kisi kaa kad ghataae louh purush kii sachhee tarif karne prasang bhi khoj paaen

 bharat or newjiland ke bich duusare test match ke pehle 'in form' keel rahul kaa chongrast hona team india ke liye jatke kii tarah rahaa
 Delhi's left-handed batsman Gautam Gambhir was named in the squad in place of Rahul, while another opener Shikhar Dhawan was already in the squad
 aise main pehle din, cricketpremiyon kii jigyaasa is baat ko lekar thi ki shikhar dhawan or gautam gambhir main se kise murali vijay ke sahyogi openar chunaa jayega
 Both these batsmen believe in increasing the score rapidly by playing in an aggressive manner
 aakhirkaar faisla 'gabbar' ke naam se lokapriy shikhar dhawan ke paksh main gaya
 Both Dhawan and Gambhir had their 'plus' and 'minus' points
 jahaan gautam gambhir ke paksh main yah baat thi ki unhone dalip trophy main haal hi main balle se acha pradarshan kiya tha
 Also his average in Test cricket is excellent (42
 58) rahaa he
 At the same time, not playing any test after August 2014 and being 35 years old was going against him
 gautam gambhir or captain viraat kohli ke rishte sahaj na hone ke baat bhi media main uthaai ja rahi thi
 Talking about Dhawan, being younger than Gautam and confident of captain Kohli was considered in his favor
 ballebaaji ausat main ve gambhir se thode hi peeche (40
 16), but his recent performance has not been special
 tippaniyan In the first test of the series on the Caribbean grounds, he started well by scoring 84 runs against West Indies but after that he was able to score 54 runs in the next three innings
more than the ran banane main naakaami se kahin adhik dhawan ke out hone kaa tarika prabandhan ke liye chintaa kaa kaaran ban rahaa tha
 He lost his wicket most of the time, playing non-responsible shots
 vaise bhi apane kariyar ke pehle test main australia ke khilaaf 187 ranon ke dhamaakedaar pari khilne ke baad dhawan ke pradarshan main sthirataa kaa abhaav rahaa he
 His batting performance has been swinging between 'sometimes good and sometimes weak'
 2015 main dakshin africa ke khilaaf siries main bhi dhawan bada score nahin bana paae the or set hone ke baad wicket ganvaane kii chook unhen baari padi thi
 In the first test of the series in Mohali, he was dismissed at 0 in both innings
 aisi sthiti main shikhar or gambhir main kisi ek ko chunanaa captain viraat kohli or coach anil kumble ke liye aasaan nahin tha
 Eventually Shikhar Dhawan got a place in the team
 yah alag baat rahi ki dhawan pehali pari main to is maukey kaa laabh nahin uthaa sake or mahaj ek ran banaakar watling kii gend par bold ho gaye
 Without looking at the wicket, he tried to take a cut shot with the cross and lost his wicket and the chance he got
 swaabhaavik rup se, is naakaami ke baad gambhir par tarjeeh dete hue unhen plaing ilevan main sthaan dene ke faisle par sawaal to uthenge hi 
 
 dhawan or gambhir, donon ke apane 'plus' or 'mines' point the
 Where there was talk in favor of Gautam Gambhir that he did well with the bat recently in the Duleep Trophy
 iske alaava test cricket main unka ausat behtareen (42
 58) has been
 vahiin agast 2014 ke baad koi test nahin khelnaa tathaa 35 varsh kii umr hona unke khilaaf ja rahaa tha
 Gautam Gambhir and captain Virat Kohli were also being raised in the media for not being comfortable
 dhawan ke lihaaj se baat karen to gautam ke mukaable kam umr kaa hona or captain kohli kaa vishwast hona unke paksh main mana gaya
 He is only slightly behind Gambhir in batting average (40
 16) hai, lekin unka haal kaa pradarshan koi khaas nahin rahaa he
 The comments westeindies ke khilaaf, carabian maidaanon par hui siries ke pehle test main unhone 84 ran banaakar acchhee shuruyaat kii thi lekin iske baad agali teen pariyon main ve 54 ran hi bana paae the
 More than the failure to score runs, the way Dhawan was dismissed was causing concern for the management
 unhone zyaadaatar baar gairjimmedaarana shotkhelte hue apana wicket ganvaaya
 Anyway, after playing a blistering innings of 187 runs against Australia in the first test of his career, Dhawan has lacked consistency
 unka ballebaaji pradarshan 'kabhi achche or kabhi kamjor' ke bich jhulata rahaa he
 In 2015, Dhawan could not score a big score in the series against South Africa and he missed the loss of wickets after being set
 mohali main hue siries ke pehle test main to ve donon pariyon main 0 par out hue the
 In such a situation, it was not easy for captain Virat Kohli and coach Anil Kumble to choose between Shikhar and Gambhir
 aakhirkaar shikhar dhawan ko team main sthaan mila
 It was a different matter that Dhawan could not take advantage of this opportunity in the first innings and bowled at Watling's ball after scoring just one run
 wicket par nigaah jamaaye bina unhone aade balle se cat shot lagane kii koshish kii or apana wicket or hasil hua mauka ganvaa baithe
 Naturally, after this failure, the decision to place him in the playing XI would be questioned, preferring Gambhir

 The special thing is that running the train between Mathura and Palwal at a speed of 180 kmph will be a new record of speed for the Indian Railways
 desh main abtak sabase tej chalane vaali gatiman express kii adhiktam raftaar 160 kilometre prati ghanta hi he
 Trial between Bareilly and Moradabad Successful train between Asaralbareli and Moradabad train from foreign coaches has been seen running at a speed of 115 kmph from Indian engine from 29 May to 11 June and all the information was analyzed by RDSO
 ardso ke ejiniers ne talgo kii train ko bhartiya trek par 115 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar par feet paaya he
 9 coaches for the trial were brought from Spain by Spain's company Talgo, which shipped 9 train coaches from India to Barcelona in Mumbai last April for a trial run in India
 talgo ke rail dibbe pani ke jahaaj se aae the
 After the custom clearance, the coaches of the Tailgocompany were sent to the workshop at Izatnagar near Bareilly Junction, UP
 yahaan par talgo company ke ejiniyaron ne apane dibbon par upkaran lagaayenge
 After this, the trial of the Talgo Company's semi-high speed train started between Bareilly and Moradabad
 talgo train kii raftaar 350 kimi prati ghante takatalgo company 70 saal puraani company he or is company ko semi hai speed yani 160-250 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar vaali trainon or hai speed yani 350 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar vaali trainon kii manuphaccharing main maharath hasil he

 bhartiya railway kii raftaar badhaane ke liye talgo company ne apni takanic ofer kii he or is takanic ke pradarshan ke liye khud apane kharch par company ne dibbe bheje hai
 The specialty of the 8 Chakketalgo Company's coaches in a compartment of a Talgo train is that they can run at high speeds even on fast curved turns
 talgo dibbon main bhartiya rail ke mukaable aadhe se bhi kam chakke lage hai
 For example, 8 wheels are put in a train compartment
 lekin talgo ke prati dibbe main do chakke lage hote hai
 Apart from this, due to the Talgo coaches being made of aluminum, Indian Railways coaches are only 16 tonnes as against the weight of 68 tonnes
 lekin inaki keemat kii baat karen to bhartiya rail dibbon ke mukaable inaki keemat teen gune se zyada padegi
 According to the trailrailway Board, which will be on the 93 km long track, after the completion of the Bareilly trial, the Talgo trial will start from June 22 on the 93 km track between Mathura and Palwal
 yahaan par safal trial ke baad talgo kii train ko mumbai or nai dilli ke bich july main chalaakar dekha jayega
 Experts say that the average speed of Shatabdi trains is 80 kilometers per hour at this time
 talgo kii train main ausat speed 130 kilometre prati ghanta rahane kii sambhaavna he
 This simply means that the Talgo train will cover 1380 kilometers between Mumbai and New Delhi within 10 to 11 hours

 On the commencement of the proceedings in the Lok Sabha, members of the Left parties, including Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj, sought to postpone the Question Hour to discuss the IPL dispute and set up a JPC to investigate it

 The Leader of the Opposition said that this is a case in which new skeletons are coming out every day
