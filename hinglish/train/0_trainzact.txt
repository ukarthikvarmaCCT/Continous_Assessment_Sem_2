 There is a spectacular view in Sri Krishna temples on Thursday
 gupta ne kaha, 370 khatm hone se rajya main shanti or samruddhi badhegipurv siem ne yah bhi kaha ki najarband netaaon kii rihaai jald hogijammu main ravan dahan kaarykram main hissaa lene pahunche bhartiya janata party (bijepi) netaa or purv upmukhyamantri kavindra gupta ne kaha ki is saal kaa dashahra khaas he kyonki jammu kashmir ko rakshasi takaton se mukt kar diya gaya he
 Gupta said that with the repeal of Article 370, a new era of peace and prosperity will begin in Jammu and Kashmir
 ghati main netaaon kii najarbandi par unhone kaha ki kashmir main rajanetaaon ko jald reeha kiya jayega
 Union Home Minister Amit Shah had recently made a similar statement and said that Article 370, removed from the state on August 5, was not only a hindrance to the unity and integrity of the country, but it was also the biggest impediment in the development of Jammu and Kashmir
 use ab do centre shasit pradeshon- vidhansabha vaale jammu kashmir or bina vidhansabha waleladakhme badal diya gaya he
 Shah said, "I strongly believe that after removing Article 370, we will succeed in completely eradicating terrorism and terrorist ideology from Kashmir
" agle 10 saal main hamaara kashmir bharat ke sabase viksit rajyon kii suchi main hoga
 " jab 49 din satta main rahane ke baad farvari, 2014 main arvind kejariwal ne dilli ke mukhyamantri ke pad se tyaagptr diya tha to unhone kaha tha ki dilli main tatkaal chunaav hone chahie
 However, it took eight months for vice-governor (LG) Najeeb Jung to make such a recommendation
 ab kendriya soochna ayog (siaisi) ne is faisle main itani deree ke kaarnon ko ujagar karne ko kaha he
 In fact, RTI activist Aditya Jain, while using the right to information, asked the Lieutenant Governor to give a detailed account of the developments between Kejriwal's resignation and the announcement of a new election
 in donon ghatnakramon ke bich ke aath maheenon ke antaraal par kejariwal ne tab sawaal khadey karte hue kaha tha ki isse dalbadal ko badhaava milane or horse-trading hone se rajaneta labhanvit ho sakate hai
 But the Lieutenant Governor refused to give details of the information sent to the Union Cabinet in this regard as a category of confidentiality
 vaise bhi kejariwal or uparajyapal ke bich ke sard rishte jagajaahir hai or saarvajanik rup se donon pakshon ke bich aarope-pratyarope kaa daur chalata rahaa he
 The comments apni artiai kaa jawaab nahin milane par jab aditya jain ne kendriya soochna ayog kaa darwaja khatkhataya to ayog ne uparajyapal se asahmati prakat karte hue us daur ke sabhi sambandhit dastavej janata ke bich saarvajanik karne kaa aadesh diya he
 The Commission has emphasized that in the event of political crisis, the advice given to the Governor or the President does not come under the purview of secrecy
 haal main centre sarkaar ne uttarakhand or arunachal pradesh main upje siyaasi gatirodh ke bich in rajyon main raashtrapati shashan lagane sambandhi raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ko saunpi gai reporton ko gopneeyata kii shrenee main maanane kii daleel di thi
 Significantly, the Congress governments in these two states were evicted from power
 iske khilaaf uttarakhand ke maamle main congress ne supreme court main cese jitkar satta main vaapasi kii
 After the fall of the Congress government in Arunachal Pradesh, the former Congress members who have played the bugle of rebellion within the party have come to power with the support of BJP
 darasal artiai kaaryakarta aditya jain ne soochna ke adhikaar kaa istemaal karte hue uparajyapal se kejariwal ke tyaagptr dene or nae chunaav kii ghoshnaa ke bich ke ghatnakram kaa silsilewar byoraa dene ko kaha tha
 At an interval of eight months between these two developments, Kejriwal then questioned that politicians could benefit from this by promoting defection and horse-trading
 lekin uparajyapal ne is sambandh main kendriya cabinet ko bheji gai soochna ko gopneeyata kii shrenee main bataate hue soochna kaa byoraa dene se inkaar kar diya
 As it is, the cold relations between Kejriwal and the Lieutenant Governor are well known and there has been a spate of accusations between the two parties in public
 tippaniyan When Aditya Jain approached the Central Information Commission on not getting a response to his RTI, the Commission, while disagreeing with the Lieutenant Governor, ordered all the relevant documents of that period to be made public
 ayog ne jor dete hue kaha he ki raajnneetik sankat se upje halaat kii sthiti main rajyapal yaa raashtrapati ko di gai salaah gopneeyata ke daayre main nahin aati
 Recently, the central government had argued that the reports submitted to President Pranab Mukherjee for imposing President's rule in these states amid the political deadlock in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh were treated as confidentiality
 gauratlab he ki in donon rajyon main congressi sarkaron ko satta se bedakhal kar diya gaya tha
 In the Uttarakhand case against this, the Congress returned to power by winning a case in the Supreme Court
 arunachal pradesh main congressi sarkaar ke patan ke baad party ke bheetar vidroh kaa bigul bajaane vaale purv congressi sadsy bhaajapa ke sahyog se satta main aae hai

 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has said that the case of removal of AFSPA from areas of the state where the army is not conducting its activities is completely justified
 unhone kaha ki vah is maamle ko taarkik nishkarsh tak le jaaenge
 Abdullah said, 'I believe our demand is based on logic and it is not emotional
 maine is maamle ko taarkik nishkarsh tak le jane kaa iraadaa kiya he
 Omar was asked questions by reporters during a function to mark the completion of three years of the coalition government in the state
 umr abdulla ke netritv main gathbandhan sarkaar ne paanch janvari, 2009 ko shapath liya tha
 Governance, development and policies are mentioned in the report card issued by the government

 This week Kejriwal's picket and Somnath Bharti's vigilantism were in the news
 yahaan sawaal he ki kya in sabake bich aap kii lokapriyata main koi kami ai he, is morche par ek survey aam aadmi party ko tasalli or hausala de saktaa he
 This survey has been done by Hansa Research for NDTV
 isamen 22−23 janvari ko dilli, mumbai or bengalooru ke ek hajaar se zyada logon kii raay lee gai
 The result showed that more than half of the people are also supporting Kejriwal's dharna and consider Kejriwal as the best Chief Minister
 xxrep 54 - dekhen : survey main puche gaye saare sawaal or unke jawaab xxrep 50 - xxrep 5 - dilli main rail bhawan ke saamne ek mukhyamantri kaa dharne par baithna logon ko kaisaa laga? kya apni sarkaar ke rahete ye dharna uchit tha? hansaa research ke survey main dilli ke 51 fisadi logon ne ise sahi bataaya, vahiin 39 fisadi logon ne galat
 While 51 per cent of the people of Bengaluru also appeared with it, 35 per cent against it and 58 per cent of the people of Mumbai came with Kejriwal, but 30 per cent people did not consider it right
 lekin, yahaan ek or ahm sawaal yah he ki mukhyamantri ke taur par kejariwal kaa kaam kaisaa he? to iske jawaab main 19 fisadi dilliwaalon ne ise bahut acha, 39 fisadi ne ise acha, jabaki 19 fisadi dilliwaalon ne ise bura qaraar diya
 On the other hand, if we talk about Bengaluru, 11 per cent of Bengaluru people consider it very good and 48 per cent consider it good
 sirf 8 fisadi bengalooru vaale unke kaam ko kharaab maanate hai
 At the same time, Kejriwal's work is very good in the eyes of 28 per cent Mumbai people and good for 45 per cent
 sirf 7 fisadi mumbaikar aise rahe, jinaki nigaah main kejariwal bura kaam kar rahe hai
 At the same time, the next question of the survey was who is the better Chief Minister in Kejriwal, Dr
 Harshvardhan and Sheela Dixit
 yahaan kejariwal apane pratidwandviyon se koson aage dikhe
 63 per cent of Delhiites consider Kejriwal better, while 23 per cent are giving their votes to Harsh Vardhan and only 9 per cent to Sheila Dixit
 isi tarah 50 fisadi bengalooru waalon kii nigaah main kejariwal behatar hai, 18 fisadi kii nigaah main harshavardhan or 21 fisadi shila dikshit ke saath hai
 Even in Mumbai, 62 percent consider Kejriwal better, while 22 percent consider Dr
 Harsh Vardhan and only 3 percent Sheila Dixit
 iske alaava dilli police kiske paas ho, centre ke paas yaa rajya sarkaar ke paas, is ek sawaal par janamat kejariwal kii raay ke khilaaf he
 Here 56 per cent of Delhiites believe that the police should be under the center, while only 36 per cent believe that the police should be under the state government
 vahiin 50 fisadi bengalooru waalon kii raay he ki police centre ke adheen hi thik he or 35 fisadi dilli police ko dilli sarkaar ke hawaale karne ke haq main hai
 However, the opinion of Mumbai people here is somewhat close to Kejriwal
 42 fisadi mumbai vaale maanate hai ki centre sarkaar ke paas hi police thik he, jabaki 43 fisadi mumbai waalon kii raay ulti he
 Even after this disagreement, the stars of the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi are elevated
 agar abhi vahaan se phir se chunaav ho jaaen, to is survey ke mutabik aam aadmi party ko apane dam par bahumat mil jayega, kyonki dilli ke 57 fisadi vot aap ko ja rahe hai, 29 fisadi bijepi ko or 10 fisadi vot congress ko

 Prabhakar used to run the expenses of the house
 lekin 1 saal pehle kidney kharaab hone kii vajah se unhen aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 '' Link in bio Hi my name is Karenjit Weber and i am raising funds for my friend, Prabhakar
 He is the one who takes care of our whole team while i am shooting
 He is also the Mamaji (uncle) of Nisha, Asher and Noah
 He is the sole bread winner which makes it very difficult for his family to bear the expenses of his treatment
 He has a wife, a mother and his child who depend on him
 He has been fighting Kidney failure
 One year ago he was hospitalized in a horrible hospital that was not treating his condition properly and told him that he needed to remove his kidneys
 They would have killed him for his organs
 Daniel (my husband) and i had no idea until the last minute and removed him from that place immediately and cleared his bills for release
 We then admitted him in a proper hospital and he saw a kidney specialist who informed us that only 20% of his kidneys are functioning
 With proper eating and medication he has been able to make it through the year
 His entire family depends on him for their survival, making it nearly impossible for him to take the rest that he so badly requires for his medical condition
 He has recently been hospitalized because he has complete kidney failure and has to be on dialysis
 He was even recently pronounced dead on the table and somehow with the hand of God he was resuscitated and brought back to us
 He now needs a kidney transplant so he can recover properly to live and work in the field that makes him so happy
 The funds raised will be used towards his: Surgery, Doctor's Consultation Charges, Post-operative care, Medicines, transplanta post shared bysunny Leone(@sunnyleone) onaug 8, 2018 at 9:50am pdtve aage likhti hai, ''jis aspataal main prabhakar apana ilaaj kara rahe the vahaan unka galat treetment hua
 As soon as me and Daniel realized this, we shifted Prabhakar to another hospital and filled his medical bills
 tab tak prabhakar kii kidney sirf 20% hi kaam kar rahi thi
 "sunny Leone did 6 porn movies together on this condition
" Prabhakar's health improved due to good treatment
 lekin kuch samay pehle puri kidney kharaab hone ke kaaran unhen dialysis par rakhaa gaya he
 Recently he was declared dead until once
 lekin bhagwaan kii krupa se ve batch gaye
 Prabhakar needs a kidney transplant so that he can recover
 jo bhi paisa jamaa hoga use prabhakar kii surgery, doctor kii fees, dawaaiyon, transplant, oparation ke baad kii dekhbhaal main kharch kiya jayega

 Sometimes the revenge of the mother and father's death, sometimes the revenge of the rape of the wife and sister
 kabhi dushmano ke bich ladaai ke saath badla to kabhi pushtaini badale kii kahani! har dashak main badla lene kii kahani ko diarectors ne apane-apane andaaj main suspence or drama ke taur par pesh kiya he
 Now in 2015, director Shriram Raghavan has brought some similar story
 kahani main kitna damafilm shuru hone se pehle ek kathan aata he Axe forgets But Tree Remembers yani kulhadi to bhul jaati he, lekin ped ko yaad rahata he ki usko kisne kaata tha
 Director Sriram Raghavan has tried to create an atmosphere of revenge from this opening statement
 'badlapur', kahani he raghu (varun dhawan) kii, jo ek aid agency main kaam karata he
 He has a laughing family
 lekin ek bank main chori ke dauraan kuch aisa vakya hota he, jisaki vajah se uski bivi misha (yami gautam) or bete kii maut ho jaati he
 In the crime of robbery, the police is worth (nawazuddin Siddiqui)

 badla lene ke liye raghu ko lagbhag 15 saal intjaar bhi karnaa hota he
 It is then avenged in different ways

 Varun Dhawan's different flavor as Raghu is in front of the audience
 vah ab tak hansi-majaak karte najar aate the, lekin unka yah rup sabase zyada pasand kiya jane vaala hoga
 Varun plays two different ages in the film
 film kii actress main jhimali ke rup main huma kuraishi ho yaa kanchan urf cocao ke rup main radhika apte
 Divya Dutta in the character of Samaj Sevi or Yami Gautam as Raghu's wife

 'laayak' ko jis harfanmaulaa andaaj main navazuddin ne nibhaayaa he vah aapako film dekhne ke ghanton baad bhi yaad rakhane par majaboor kar detaa he
 Shriram Raghavan has made his mark in the role of the casting, writing and directing trio of Badlapur
 kahana galat nahin hoga ki is film se unhone 'agent vinod' kii naakamayaabi kaa badla liya he
 Another feature of the film is its songs
 khaas baat yah he ki film kaa koi bhi gaanaa isaki gati ko dhimaa nahin karata
 Why not see 'badlapur' is an adult film
 hinsak he
 That is, if you are not an adult, then you should not watch this movie at all

 i hope both of them find peace in this hour of grief
 'this is going to be my first and only reaction to the whirlwind news that broke 24 hours ago and that i was swept up into
 i am not used to commenting on things like this nor taking them seriously but as this situation is spiraling and affecting people i love, i have to speak up
 Firstly, many years ago, i met the man of my life, father of our son and of the baby we are expecting
 He is my love, my best friend, the only one that i need
 Secondly to those who have indicated that i am devastated, i am very well thank you
 This crafted conversation isn't distressing
 And to all the media and the haters who are quick to pass judgment, i sincerely wish you a swift recovery
 Finally, i do very much wish that Angelina and Brad, both whom i deeply respect, will find peace in this very tumultuous moment
 With all my love Marion Ceci sera la première et seule réaction que j'aurai concernant la déferlante inouïe qui à commencé il y a de ça 24 heures et à laquelle je suis mêlée malgré moi
 Je n'ai pas pour habitude de commenter ni de prendre au sérieux le tas d'absurdités déversées à mon sujet mais la situation prenant une telle tournure et affectant des gens que j'aime, je me dois de m'exprimer
 Pour commencer, j'ai rencontré il y a quelques années l'homme de ma vie , le père de notre fils et du bébé que nous attendons aujourd'hui
 Il est mon amour, mon meilleur ami et le seul homme dont j'ai besoin
 Ensuite, à ceux qui me prétendent dévastée, je vais très bien merci
 Ce genre d'inventions aberrantes ne m'affecte en aucun cas
 Et pour finir, à la "presse", à tous les haters, trolls et consorts qui ont le jugement si rapide je vous souhaite sincèrement
 
 
 un prompt rétablissement
 Ceci dit et un peu plus sérieusement, je souhaite à Angelina et Brad, deux personnes pour qui j'ai un profond respect, de trouver la paix dans ce moment tumultueux
 Avec tout mon amour

 ye wo slogan hai jo ladakiyon kii padhai ko badhaava dene ke liye die jate rahe hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been laying special emphasis on the education of girls
 vahiin haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter kaa focus bhi kanya bhrun hatya ke abhishaap se rajya ko puri tarah mukt karne or ladakiyon ko shiksha ke liye protsaahit karne par rahaa he
 Now it is different that in Rewari, Haryana, girls have to fight their own battle for studies
 rewadi main chhedhkhani se pareshaan ladakiyon kaa anshanarewadi ke khol block ke gaanv gothda tappa dahina kii 80 se adhik ladkiyaan beete ek hafte se anshan par hai
 Their demand is that the status of the school up to 10th of the village should be increased to senior secondary so that it can be studied up to 12th standard
 yahaan kii chaatraon ko 10veen se aage kii padhai ke liye canavali sthit skool janaa padataa he
 This school is about 3 kilometers from their village
 chaatraon ke mutabik unhen roj skool aane-jane main chhedhkhani kaa shikaar hona padataa he
 The sarpanch of the village, Suresh Chauhan, says that molesters of molested boys are so vicious that they wear helmets so that they cannot be identified
 anshan ne 4 ladakiyon kii haalat bigadinladakiyon ne apni pareshaani gharavaalon ke saath hi sarpanch ko bhi bataai
 The family even told the girls to leave school
 vahiin sarpanch ne maamle ko sthaneey adhikariyon ke saamne uthaaya lekin baat nahin bani
 Eventually, these girls started a hunger strike, taking charge on their own
 ek to bheeshan garmi or upar se bhukh hadtaal kii vajah se chaar ladakiyon kii tabiyat bighad gai to unhen aspataal main bhartee karana padaa
 One girl had to refer to PGI Rohtak and two had to be admitted to Rewari Trauma Center
 haryana ke shiksha mantri kaa hairaan karne vaala bayanek ore chatraayen beete ek hafte se bheeshan garmi main anshan karte hue behaal hai
 At the same time, Haryana Education Minister Ram Vilas Sharma sees the opposition of the students in some way connected with politics
 sharma ke mutabik wo chaatraon se apil karte hai ki ve raajnneeti ke chakkar main naa paden
 According to Sharma, the work of upgrading the school will be under process and they assure the girl students that action will start soon
 sharma ne ye bhi kaha ki haryana main bhi uttar pradesh ke anti romeo squad kii tarj par chhedhkhani rokane ke liye police ne abhiyaan ched rakhaa he
 Haryana's DGP is himself supervising 'operation Durga'
 sharma ne ladakiyon se apana dharna khatm karne kii apil bhi kii
 After a week passed on the girls' demands, no one has corrected the demands of the girls, so they have themselves locked the gate of the village school
 in chaatraon kaa kahana he ki jin halaat se hamen is vakt guzarana pad rahaa he, ham nahin chaahatin ki hamaare chote bhai-bahanon ko bhi vahi sab saamana karnaa pade
 According to the girls, the younger siblings will not be sent to the school until their demand to upgrade the school is met
 ladakiyon kaa kahana he ki jab takaskulko apgrade karne kii baat likhit main unhen nahin saunpi jaaegi tab tak unka anshan jari rahegaa or skool kaa taala bhi nahin khulne diya jayega
 The sarpanch of the village, Suresh Chauhan, is accompanying the girls in their fast to boost their morale

 The MLA justified the demand of the students and said that they have spoken to the Education Minister in this matter
 agar gaanv ke skool main bacchon kii sankhya bad jaae to wo skool ko apgrade kara denge
 At the same time, District Basic Education Officer Raj Kumar says that there are certain standards set by the government to upgrade schools
 agar inhen puraa kiya jaae to skool ko apgrade karne ke liye patr ucch adhikariyon ke paas bheja ja saktaa he
 The education department says that there is a minimum number of students to upgrade the school as a secondary school
 lekingaanv ke schulmen us sankhya se kam chaatr-chatraayen hai
 Despite this, the demand of female students will be reached to the government

 Shivpal told reporters here that he would form the Samajwadi Secular Front on July 6
 lakhanu main sammelan bulaakar isaki aupchaarik ghoshnaa kii jaaegi
 He told that SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav will be the chairman of this front, while he himself will be its convenor
 samaajawaadee secular morcha koi raajnneetik dal nahin hoga
 Its purpose will be to overcome the shortcomings of the SP
 shivpal ne kaha ki sapa ke upekshit logon ko is morche se joda jayega
 Other parties will also be talked
 is saal ek janvari ko akhilesh yadav ke sapa kaa adhyaksh banane ke baad party main haashiye par pahunche shivpal ne kaha ki netaa ji (mulaayam) ke bina koi samaajwaad nahin chal saktaa
 It may be known that Shivpal had announced the formation of the Socialist Secular Front only last month
 unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki sapa main baar-baar unka or mulaayam kaa apmaan kiya gaya
 Shivpal, who was the Public Works Minister in the previous SP government, while referring to the project 'gomti River Front' which came under scrutiny, said that as long as he was a minister, there was no disturbance in the project
 uske baad kya hua, vah nahin jaanate
 The comments (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Shivpal said that the neglected people of SP will be linked with this front

 ) Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has recommended a CBI probe in the biggest creation scandal in Bhagalpur of recent times in Bihar
 bataa den ki 'srijan' ek gaiyr sarkari sanstha he, jo jile main mahilaon ke vikaas ke liye kaary karti thi, asal main is sanstha kaa mukhya dhandha karodon kaa gorakhdhandha tha
 With the connivance of banks, this institution made illegal withdrawals of more than Rs 300 crore from the government deposit account
 shuukravaar ko 'aaj tak' bhagalpur ke sabor block main pahunchaa, jahaan par 'srijan' kaa mukhya daftar tha
 Although this office has been sealed by the Economic Offenses Wing, which is investigating this entire racket, but the 'aaj Tak' team went inside this office and found that it is here to empower women and provide jobs
 Papad, spices, saris and handloom clothes were made by this institution
 is daftar main paae gaye masaale or papad sabhi 'srijan' brands se bazaar main beche jate the
 The crores of scam will come out
 Now it has become clear that the business of making papad and spices was only to mislead the world and in fact the illegal work of illegal withdrawal of crores of rupees from the government treasury was the main task
 jaanch main yah baat saamne ai he ki ab tak 300 karod rupee se zyada jo is sanstha ne sarkari khajaane se avaidh rup se nikaale the
 Invested this money in the market, as well as in real estate
 in paison se logon ko 16% byaaj dar par lone bhi muhaiyaa karaayaa gaya
 Giving information to 'ajatak' that there was illegal withdrawal in two ways, Manoj Kumar, SSP of Bhagalpur said that this institution used to do illegal extraction from this entire government treasury in two ways
 ek tarika tha swip mod or doosraa tha check mod
 Through the swipe mode, huge amounts were deposited by the state government or central government in the government accounts of Bhagalpur district
 swip mod main rajya sarkaar yaa centre sarkaar ek patr ke madhyam se bank ko suchit karti thi ki kitni raashi bank main jamaa kara di gai he
 Bank officials were also involved in this whole racket
 vah sarkari khate main is paise ko jamaa nahin dikhaakar 'srijan' ke khate main is puure paise ko jamaa kar diya karte the
 The second way was the check mode, where whatever money the state government or central government had to deposit in the government accounts of Bhagalpur district, it was done through check
 ek baar sarkari khate main check jamaa ho jaataa tha to phir jiladhikari ke daftar main shaamil kuch log jo ki is gorakhdhandhe main hissaa the, jiladhikari ke farji hastakshar se agle din vahi raashi 'srijan' ke acount main jamaa kara diya karte the
 The mastermind of Gorakhndhe was Manorama Devi Gaur, saying that so far 7 people have been arrested and 5 firs have also been filed in this whole case
 'srijan' ke sansthaapak manorama devi ke putr or bahu, amit kumaar or beti priya kumaar philhal faraar chal rahe hai or police unako giraftaar karne ke liye dabish de rahi he
 Manorama Devi, who was the mastermind of this entire gorakhandha, died in February this year

 And the same time was going on for Dhoni
 ’dhoni ne match ke baad kaha tha ki is team ko kuch or samay diya janaa chahie or kai khilaadiyon ko is siries se sikh milegi

 bollywood galiyaaron main khabaren chai hui hai ki salmaan khan ne film 'welcome tu neuyork' se arijit singh kaa gaanaa hatwakar raahat fateh ali khan se record karavaaya
 Everyone wants to know how much truth there is after this news comes
 kya abhi tak dabang khan ne singer arijit singh ko maaf nahin kiya he?bollywood life ne apni report main sutron ke hawaale se khulaasa kiya he ki is khabar main bilkul bhi sachai nahin he
 The report says that Salman Khan has only cameo in the film 'welcome to New York', it is not Salman's film
 isliye yah jaananaa jaruri he ki iske mujeec se salmaan kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Salman himself is also surprised after reading this news
 report kaa daawa he ki arijit ko yah song naa milane kii vajah mekars ho sakate hai
 Something must have happened between the two that this song could not be discussed
 aakhir main producers ko hi faisla lenaa hota he
 Salman is angry with Arijit even after 4 years, no statement of Salman and Arijit has been officially revealed in the Ganais case removed from the film
 salmaan-arijit ke bich cold war to jagajaahir he, lekin kisi or kii film main arijit ko riples karne vaali khabaron main kitni sachai he yah to vakt hi batayega
 Babul Supriyo protests against Pakistani artists, Bollywood's famous singer and Union Minister Babul Supriyo has raised the issue of banning Pakistani artists on this song of 'welcome to New York'
 babul supriyo ne kaha ki pakistani kalakaaron kaa pakistani hona hi unka aparaadh he, isliye unase bollywood ko kisi bhi tarah kaa sambandh nahin rakhana chahie
 He has asked the producers to remove the film song 'ishthar' or sing it in the voice of an Indian singer
 unhone kaha, is gane ko bhartiya kalakar arijit singh behatar tareeke se pesh kar sakate the
 Why Pakistani artists are needed in this situation? Salman had got the ad, now Kothari Arijit had asked for forgiveness for not paying the loan
 In the last days, Arijit had denied the news related to Salman and said that i will sing for Salman soon

 chhattisgarh main baba ramdev kaa daura BJP ko mahangaa pad gaya he
 Baba Ramdev set up his Yoga Camps in more than half a dozen districts of the state, and in his speeches there were fierce speeches of the Congress
 baba ramdev ne kahin BJP kii taareef kii to kahin narendra modi kii
 Following the Congress' complaint, the Election Commission has decided to add the expenditure on Baba Ramdev's camp and his visits to the BJP account
 yoga guru baba ramdev ne 4 oktober se 8 oktober tak rajya ke kai jilon main yoga shivi lagaaye or apane samarthakon se milane ke liye gramin ilaako kaa bhi daura kiya
 Baba Ramdev visited the region from Bastar to Surguja and Surguja to Rajnandgaon
 yahaan unhone kai baithken bhi kii
 Yoga camps were organized in many areas
 in tamaam ilaakon main baba ramdev ne congress kii bakhiyaan udhedi
 He gave his visit a completely political color
 natijatan congress bhi harakat main ai or usne maamle kii chunaav ayog main shikaayat kar di
 The Election Commission primarily found the complaint correct and decided to add the expenses of Baba Ramdev's visit to the BJP account
 chhattisgarh main mukhya nirvachan padaadhikari sunil kujur ne bataaya, 'abhi tak jitani jaankaree ai he usamen ye kaha he ki narendra modi achche PM rahenge or raaman singh ji achche CM rahenge
 So he can say that he can be brought under the category of paid news
 agar aisa he to khate main jodne kaa
 i have not yet seen the Dhamtari, but the expenses will not be included in any party
 lekin vaisaa kehane main bandish nahin he, ye aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan bhi nahin he
 'how much will be added to the bjp's account has not been estimated yet
 baba ramdev ke kharchon ko BJP ke chunavi kharch main jode jane se congress kii baanchhein khil gayi hai
 On the other hand, BJP is in the know about this matter
 udhar congress ne elaan kiya he ki wo jald hi baba ramdev ke kharchon kaa byoraa bhi chunaav ayog ko pesh karegi
 Baba Ramdev has praised BJP and Narendra Modi in all its meetings
 congress kaa kahana he ki yoga shivi kii aad main baba ne chunavi prachaar kiya he
 Therefore, she will also file a criminal case and violation of election code of conduct
 rafel deal par satta or vipaksh ke bich sawaal-jawaab kaa silsilaa shuukravaar ko loksabhaa main jari rahaa
 While Congress President Rahul Gandhi asked the government to answer some questions on the Rafael Deal, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman while answering most of the questions raised many such questions which the Congress was seen to be uncomfortable
 haalanki raksha mantri ke jawaab ke baad bhi congress adhyaksh daawa karte paae gaye ki unhen unke sawaalon kaa spasht jawaab nahin mila
 But during the debate, the Congress will exercise to clarify its stand on these issues raised by the Defense Minister
 nirmala kaa pehla sawalraksha mantri ne kaha ki 2001 ke baad bharat ke padosi desh china or pakistan main vayusena ko majboot karne kii kavayad joro main chal rahi thi
 Due to this, it was decided in 2002 that India should also meet the needs of the Air Force at the earliest to counter China and Pakistan
 lekin iske baad 2014 tak kendra main asin rahi upie kii congress sarkaar ne ladaaku vimaan kharid kii aisi prakriya shuru kii jo unke kaarykaal main puri nahin hui
 As a result, even after 10 years of tenure, the Congress government could not decide to buy fighter aircraft even in such sensitive case
 raksha mantri ne sawaal kiya ki aakhir kya vajah thi ki is 10 saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan congress kii manmohan singh sarkaar vayusena kii jarurat ke mutabik ladaaku vimaan nahin kharid pai?rafel deal vivaad: jaane rahul ke sawaal kaa sansad main nirmala ne kya diya javabnirmala kaa doosraa sawalrafel deal main shaamil ofaset cloj par rahul gandhi ke sawaal ki aakhir kyon sarkari company echeel ko darkinar kar narendra modi sarkaar ne anil ambani ko shaamil karne kaa faisla kiya, par raksha mantri ne kaha ki congress echeel ko lekar ghadiyaali aansu bahaane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 Nirmala Sitharaman said in the House that during the tenure of the Congress government, Dassault, the Rafale producer company, refused to take a guarantee of Rafale aircraft to be manufactured by HAL
 yah maamla endie sarkaar dwaara shuru kii gai rafel deal main chaaya rahaa or daso apni baat par adig thi kyonki uske mutabik echeel ke haathon rafel vimaan nirmaan kaary main company ko dhai guna adhik samay lagata
 Hence bringing the private company into the offset clause was extremely important
 vahiin congress sarkaar ke kaarykaal main sansad kii sthaayee samiti ne is baat ko spasht kaha ki echeel baisakhi par chalane vaali company he or usase is str ke nirmaan kii apeksha rakhana galat hoga
 So, Nirmala asked why Congress is now working to shed crocodile tears on HAL? Gone that she would not negotiate any bilateral issues with the French government
 dwipaksheeya sambandhon main protol ke mutabik do deshon ke bich kisi ahm mudde par charchaa mahaj sarkaar or sarkaar ke bich kii jaati he
 In such a situation, why did Congress President Rahul Gandhi negotiate the Rafale deal with the President of France? Is such interference in the country's bilateral relations by the opposition party justified? Nirmala's fourth defense minister said that the previous UPA government was working on the draft to buy only 18 fighter jets from Dassa in the Rafale deal and the remaining 108 aircraft
 She wanted to get the construction done through HAL
 lekin upie saude kii sachai ye he ki tatkaaleen sarkaar ne na to france sarkaar or na hi rafel nirmaataa daso ke saath echeel main nirmaan kaa koi agreement kiya
 If the Congress government was bringing HAL to this deal, why did it not make any agreement with France or Dassau? Rafael's dynasty: not the experience, Dassault did see the family, the fifth question of Ambani's agreement with Nirmala Sitharaman in Lok Sabha asked if Congress Did the UPA government really want to deal with France during its tenure? Nirmala said that during the upa's tenure, after the approval of the Central Government for the Rafale deal, UPA itself conducted an inquiry with the Expert Committee through the Ministry of Finance questioning the deal
 is samiti ne bhi jab deal ke paksh main apni manjuuri de di, upie sarkaar ne france ke saath qaraar se peeche hat gai
 After all, what was the Manmohan Singh government of Congress missing in this deal? The Defense Minister said that after the deal was stuck, the then Defense Minister (P Chidambaram) said in the House on 6 February 2014 that 'where is the money' (where is the money)
 lihaaja, kya congress sarkaar bina khajaane se paise kaa praavdhaan kiye france ke saath qaraar kar rahi thi yaa phir vitt mantri kisi or kism ke paise par sadan main pratikriya de rahe the
 Nirmala asked if the Congress government was not interested in doing the deal due to not seeing kick-back (commission) in the deal? samaajawaadee party se naata tod sattadhari bhartiya janata party kaa daaman thamte hi naresh agarwal par aalochanaon kii barish ho gai he
 Naresh Aggarwal, who is known for making controversial statements, made another statement on Monday, which has forced him to apologize as soon as he started a new innings with the saffron party
 mahanayake amitabh bachchan kii patni or sapa se samaajawaadee party netaa jaya bachchan ko lekar naresh agarwal ne jo tippanee kii, use bijepi kii mahila netaaon samet party pravaktaaon ne galat tehraate hue bayaan se kinaaraa kar liya
 But the dispute did not stop here
 jab vipaksh ne ise mudda bananaa shuru kiya to na sirfnaresh agarwal baikafootpar aae balki bijepi ko bhi vichaar karnaa padaa
 Naresh Aggarwal himself regretted his statement on Tuesday morning
 jiske baad ab khabar aa rahi he ki bijepi kii taraf se naresh agarwal ko naseehat di gai he
 According to BJP sources, keeping the Naresh Agarwal coparty line in mind, it has been decided to avoid unnecessary rhetoric
 ye tha bayansomvaar ko bijepi main shaamil hone ke baad apni pehali hi press conference main agarwal ne unki jagah jaya ko tarjeeh dene par samaajawaadee party par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 He had said that the party compared him to the film actress' who danced in films
 ' haalanki unke bayaan se vahaan baithe bijepi netaa asahaj ho gaye or unhone turant hi is bayaan se khud ko alag kar liya
 Later Naresh Aggarwal's statement was denied by Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Union Minister Smriti Irani
 agarwal ne jataayaa khedhaalanki, bayaan par vivaad ke baad naresh agarwal ne mangalvaar ko safai di
 He said, 'if anyone has suffered from my statement, i regret it
 main kisi vivaad main nahin padana chahta hum or khed jataata hum
 The media has shown my statement differently
 meraa kisi ko dukh pahunchane kaa iraadaa nahin tha
 i withdraw my words
 ' Everyone definitely has a best friend
 wo hamaari parivaar ke sadsy kii tarah hi hota he
 He does not hide anything from us
 chaahe wo hamaara krash ho yaa brallep
 Best friends become an important part of life, with whom you want to spend as much time as possible because they understand your words and give you the right advice because of your age

 go to in bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke NRC par bayaan par congress netaa manishankar ayyar ne kaha ki badi khushi he ki amit shah khud ko congressi samaj rahe hai
 He said that there is no connection between the 1985 agreement and the steps being taken
 unhone kaha, 'main khud rajeev gandhi kii sarkaar main joint secretary tha
 The time when Rajiv Gandhi decided on this agreement was with him at that time
 us aadhaar par main kahata hum ki jo samjhaute main likhaa tha or enarasi par yah jo kadam uthaaya ja rahaa he inamen main kisi prakaar kaa sambandh nahin he
 'let us know that the National President of Bharatiya Janata Party Amit Shah said on Assam's National Citizen Register (NRC) that opposition parties are misleading the country on this issue
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki congress votbank ke chakkar main bengali ghuspaithiyon ko baahar karne kaa saahas nahin dikhaa saki or ab sawaal uthaa rahi he
 He said that the Assam Accord, which took place during the time of the Rajiv Gandhi-led government, was the soul of the NRC, which explained that every illegal infiltrator would be selected and removed from the electoral rolls of the country
 vahiin, ayyar ne kaha ki tatkaaleen samjhaute main ye kaha gaya tha ki ek tribunel banegaa jo mukammal taur par jaanch karne ke baad nishkarsh par pahonchega ki march 1971 koun-koun gaiyr kanoonee tareeke se aae

 unhone kaha ki usee tareeke kaa koi tark nikaala janaa chahie tha lekin ye jo inhone kiya he ki achaanak 40 lakh jo hindustan ke bascindia hai
 Now a very big question has been raised on him
 unhone kaha, 'ek list banaai gai he, jisamen 40 lakh logon par sawaal khadey kar die gaye hai
 In our day and under the 1985 agreement, those who were determined to have come in a non-legal manner were sent back to Bangladesh
 'unke alaava, congress pravaktaa arpyen singh ne kaha ki amit shah thodaa pard liya karen
 Rahul Gandhi has already cleared his stand on this issue on the Facebook page

 In support of the victim of the Unnao rape case, many Bollywood celebs have tweeted and demanded justice
 is kadi main tvinkal khanna ne bhi twit kar peedita ke liye justise maanga
 But the alleged silence of actor Akshay Kumar on Unnao case has put the actress in question
 is ghatana par abhi tak actor ne kisi tarah se riect nahin kiya he
 This is what is knocking the users off
 tvinkal khanna ke twit ke baad logon ko akshay kumaar kii chuppi chubh rahi he
 It is known that Akshay Kumar often gives his opinion on sensitive issues
 aise main puure deshbhar main jab unnav kii peedita kaa maamla chaaya hua he, us samay khilaadi kumaar kii chuppi ne trobers ko unpar hamalaa karne kaa mauka de diya he

 '- input IANS Everyone is amazed at the air strike by the Indian Air Force entering Pakistan's Balakot
 is air strike main kitne aatankwaadi maare gaye, ye sawaal har kisi ke man main bana hua he
 Many media reports showed a wide range of numbers, but now the bjp's chief Amit Shah has given a big statement
 amit shah ne daawa kiya ki vayusena kii air strike main 250 se adhik aatankwaadi maare gaye
 Politics is now intensifying on Amit Shah's statement
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal, congress netaa kapil sibbal samet kai netaaon ne amit shah par sawaal khadey kar die hai
 The CM of Delhi asked whether Amit Shah did not trust the statement of the army
 kya amit shah ke mutabiq sena jhooth bol rahi he?sena ne saafe saafe kaha he ki koi mara yaa nahin mara yaa kitne mare, ye nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Are Amit Shah and BJP calling the army a liar for their electoral gains? The country has confidence in the army
 kya amit shah or bhaajapa ko sena par bharosa nahin?https: / / t
 co / ikbh92ht5e — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) March 4, 2019 During his speech at a rally in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, Amit Shah claimed that after the Pulwama terror attack everyone thought that there might not be a surgical strike this time, But what happened? More than 250 terrorists have been killed in the Modi government's air strike on the 13th day of the Pulwama terror attack
 amit shah ne kaha ki jab wing commander abhinandan ko pakadaa gaya to log aalochana karne lage, lekin yuddh he to ek jawan pakadaa bhi ja saktaa he
 Shah said that the effect of the Narendra Modi government was that if any war prisoner is back in the world at the earliest, then it is a greeting
 manish tiwari ne shah ko gheriumit shah ke bayaan par congress netaa manish tiwari ne sawaal khadey kiye hai
 He said that when the Air Force officials refused to give any kind of data, then why is Amit Shah making such a statement
 kya ye airstrike ko raajnneeti se jodna nahin hua
 Apart from Manish Tiwari, Kapil Sibal also questioned the Modi government
 unhone twit kiya ki duniya ke kai akhbaar kah rahe hai balakot main kuch nahin hua, to kya vah pakistan samarthak hai?modiji :is international media :1) New York Times2) London based Jane's Information Group3) Washinton Post4) Daily Telegraph5) The Guardian6) Reutersreporting no proof of militant losses at Balakot pro-pakistan ?you are guilty of politicising terror ?— Kapil Sibal (@kapilsibal)march 4, 2019AVM RGK Kapoor said "it would be premature to say that what is the number of casualties that we have been able to inflict on those camps and what is the number of deaths," but@amitshahsays over 250 Terrorists killed in airstrike
 Is this not milking Air Strikes for Politics? vayusena ne apane bayaan main kaha tha ki unke nishane target par lage hai, jo wo karnaa chaahate the wo kiya he
 However, no data was released
 airstrike ke baad se hi congress samet kai vipakshi partiyon ke netaaon ne air strike ke sabooton kii maang kii he
 Congress leader Digvijay Singh said in his statement on Sunday that just as the US had released the evidence to kill Osama bin Laden, the Indian government should keep the information about the air strike in front
 sirf digvijay singh hi nahin balki pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne bhi centre sarkaar se air strike ke saboot saamne rakhane kii baat kahi thi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given his response many times to these questions of the opposition
 ravivaar ko hi patna raily main piem modi ne kaha tha ki vipaksh ke kuch log is prakaar ke sawaal uthaa rahe hai, jisase pakistan kii sansad, media ko phayda mil rahaa he
 The Prime Minister said that such a statement is being made to break the morale of the army
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhiko party supremeo banane ke liye abhi thodaa intjaar karnaa hoga, kyonki congress agle maheene party adhiveshan ko lekar bahut icchhuk nahin he
 Senior party leaders have dismissed speculations of Rahul Gandhi becoming president in April
 congress netaaon ne kaha ki party april maheene main ol india congress kamity kaa adhiveshan bulaane ko lekar icchhuk nahin he
 Therefore, Rahul may be delayed in taking over the reins of the party
 angreji akhbaar 'iconomic times' ne is aashay kii khabar prakashit kii he
 a top Congress official said, "he may be made Congress chief later this year
 ' congress netaa ne kaha ki party eisisi adhiveshan ko abhi sthagit rakhane kii yojana bana rahi he
 Another leader said that the Vice President of the Congress will return to the political scene later this month
 raajnneetik paridrishy se rahul kii anupasthiti ko congress netaaon ne party main yuva banaam bujurg sipaahiyon kii ladaai maanane se inkaar kar diya
 a leader close to Rahul Gandhi said that Congress President Sonia Gandhi is aware that her son has been missing from the scene for some time and that it is not a matter of confrontation
 in netaaon ne kaha ki maa or bete kii jodi party main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai or sonia gandhi chaahati he ki rahul party ko aage lekar jaaen
 However, senior leaders like Digvijay Singh have been saying that Sonia Gandhi is influenced by some leaders, due to which there are differences between Rahul and Sonia on political matters
 isse pehle congress netaa kamalnath ne kaha tha ki party main nirnay kii prakriya rahul or sonia ke bich jhulati rahati he
 Nath had also said that Rahul does not have full power, so it would not be right to 'judge' him
 isse pehle rahul gandhi ke kareebi netaaon ne kaha tha ki party upaadhyaksh april main aal india congress kamity kii baithak main party adhyaksh ban sakate hai
 However, now senior party leaders have rejected it

 Electoral bonds have become the most preferred method of corporate funding for political donations
 association for democratic riforms (ediaar) ke taaja adhyayan ke mutabik kaarobaari gharaanon ne beete 6 saal main elactoral treston or sidhe chande ke madhyam se kareeb 2000 karod rupye chanda diya
 These electoral trusts were formed during the tenure of the UPA government
 dilachasp he ki is saal janvari se may tak paanch maheene main hi endie sarkaar kii ore se laae elactoral bonds ke jariye pichley 6 saal kii tulana main dugana chanda aayaa
 ADR studies show that corporate donations to political parties have increased significantly in recent years
 elactoral bonds ke jariye chanda sikret rahane kaa sarkaar daawa karti he or kahati he ki sirf inhen jari karne vaale bank ko hi chanda dene vaale kaa pataa hota he
 Opposition parties have been alleging that this bond scheme is in favor of the party whose government is in power
 kaarobaari gharaanon kii ore se raajnneetik chanda dene ke tareeke main badlaav aayaa he
 The latest study suggests that corporates have shifted to electoral bonds to fund political parties
 ye ateet ke tareekon se hat kar he
 Business houses 1941 between 2012 and 2018
 95 karod rupee raajnneetik dalon ko chanda diya
 91 of this total donation
 17 fisadi he
 Total donations to political parties 2129 in these six years
 92 karod rupee mila
 Out of this, 50 per cent of the donations came through 26 electoral trusts which were formed in the Congress-led UPA government
 baaki chanda kaarobaari gharaanon kii ore se sidhe diya gaya
 The entire picture changed with the Modi government's introduction of electoral bonds in March 2018
 raajnneetik dalon ko is saal janvari se may ke bich 4794 karod rupee chanda mila
 In 2018, Electoral bonds worth Rs 1056 crore were sold in the months of March, April, July, October, November
 abhi tak kul 5851 karod rupee ke elactoral bond bik chuke hai
 India Today TV had earlier reported that BJP received 95 percent of the total electoral bonds sold in 2017-18
 ek artiai se khulaasa hua tha ki kul 222 karod rupee ke elactoral bonds main se bijepi ko 210 karod rupee chanda mila
 The head of ADR, Major General (retd) Anil Verma told India Today TV, 'electoral bonds are preferred because they are opaque, only the donors, banks and the government are aware of this
 yahi vajah he ki ham elactoral trust kii tulana main elactoral bonds aane par chande main teji se badhottaree hui he
 The ADR study shows that in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in political donations by corporates
 saal 2004-05 se saal 2011-12 main raajnneetik dalon ko gyaat sroton se milane vaale chande main se 87 fisadi kaarobaari gharaanon se aayaa
 These shares increased to 87 per cent between 2012-13 and 2015-16
 saal 2016-17 se saal 2017-18 ke bich kaarobaari gharaanon se chande kii ye hissedari badhkar 93 fisadi tak ja pahunchi
 The analysis of donations from corporates to political parties shows that all national parties are receiving donations from them, but BJP is the most preferred party
 bijepi ko gyaat sroton se jitna kul chanda mila usamen se 94 fisadi corporates se aayaa
 At the same time, out of the total donations received by the NCP, the corporate share was 93% and Congress had 81%
 yahaan tak ki sipiem ko bhi kul mili chande main se 55 fisadi corporates se mila
 BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao defended BJP getting the thickest share of political donations
 raav ne india today tivi se kaha, ‘bijepi chanda paardarshee tareeke se leti he jabaki congress number 2 tareeke se ye karti he
 Cash donations have been his tradition
 ’raav ne aarope lagaaya, ‘congress kii nakad main kaale dhan kaa chanda lene kii samskruti rahi he, congress ne samanaantar arthvyavastha khadi kii jisase ki mukhya taur par wo apane raajnneetik funding ke hiton ko sadhti rahe
 BJP is the largest party, hence it is getting the most political donations
 ’congress ne bijepi par palatwaar karte hue aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar vipaksh ko dabaane ke liye nae nae tareeke dhund rahi he
 Congress MP PL Punia alleged- 'through electoral bonds, BJP has found a new way to get all the donations

 For this, he only had to enter the 12-digit Aadhaar card number
 adhikari ne bataaya ki iske baad UIDAI ne vyavastha main badlaav kiya or acces fingerprint dene ke baad hi milti he
