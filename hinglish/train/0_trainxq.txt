 film kaa naam:em es dhoni: da antold storydiarector:niraj pandestar cast:sushant singh rajput, anupam kher, kiyaara adwani, disha pataani, rajesh sharma, bhoomika chawlivadhi:3 ghanta 10 minutesrtificate:uretimga:3
 Director Neeraj Pandey, who has given commendable films like 5 stars 'baby', 'special Chhabbis', 'A Wednesday', has brought a film based on the life of the great cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 saath main hai sushant singh rajput
 Now the question is whether Neeraj can make a great film without Akshay Kumar? The story of the beginning of Mahi The film's story begins in Ranchi city where Mahi aka Mahi (mahendra Singh Dhoni) was born to Paan Singh Dhoni (anupam Kher) it happens
 baccha cricket kaa shaukeen or ghar waalon kii ichha he ki maahi kii railway main government job lag jaae
 The same situation in you and our home, which makes the film look realistic
 lekin ek ofer maahi or is film kii disha badal detaa he
 Mahi's journey from Ranchi to Delhi, followed by the entry of girlfriend (disha Patani) into Mahi's life and a lot of twists are threaded in interesting ways
 film main maahi ke kariyar ko dikhaaya he or ise and kiya he sakshi (kiyaara adwani) sang unki shaadi se lekar 2011 ke world cap jeetne ke sikvence par 
 5 points you would think with a film: 1
 dhoni kii cricket life se to aap waakif honge lekin ground ke baahar kis tarah ek cricketer kii jindagi main utaar-chadhaav aate hai, iskaa pataa aapako film dekhakar lag jayega
 This is a story of which people of any class will be able to connect themselves
 haalanki diarector ne dhoni kaa naam bada hone ke peeche kii in ghatnaon ko kaaphi halke se prastut kiya he
 The film has shown many things like Dhoni Yuvraj's first meeting, team selection, from a different aspect
 2
 Anupam Kher is definitely seen in Neeraj Pandey's films, who have also played well this time
 uske saath-saath sushant singh rajput kii mehnat parde par saaf jhalkati he
 After 'kai Po Che' once again he is comfortable with crickets
 disha pataani, kiyaara adwani, rajesh sharma, kumud mishra, bhoomika chawla kii maujuudagi se pataa chalata he kii film kii casting karact he or niraj ne hameshaa kii tarah in par kaaphi kaam kiya he
 3
 film main cricket kii bajaay romance haaavee he
 Priyanka had a place in Dhoni's life before Sakshi, the director has left no stone unturned to show it, it is often seen in many biopics that a lot of personal things are not shown completely, but in this film such No, many aspects of Dhoni's personal life are closely shown
 cricket board kii chayan samiti or kuch controvartial khabaron jaise dhoni-viru vivaad ke bare main bhi kuch khulaase kiye gaye hai
 4
 cinemetography, loketions aapako kahani ke saath-saath baandhe rakhte hai or camera work bhi laajawab he, jo vijual se aapkaa dhyaan hatane nahin detaa
 Also, the way Sushant's face has been fitted on Dhoni's face every time through the graphics, it seems quite natural
 5
 Even before release, the music of the film has managed to attract the attention of the audience and after watching the film it can be said that the music fully supports the story of the film
 khaas taur se gaanaa 'besabriyaan' jisaki feel puri film ke dauraan aap mahasoos kar sakate hai
 Length can bore
 
 
 film kii kamjor kadi isaki length he, kabhi-kabhigaanon kii lambaaibhi tang karne lagati he, jinhen edit kiya jaataa to film crisp lagati
 Sitting in the hall for a three-hour and ten-minute film is also a bit annoying
 box offisvaise to fox star studios kii taraf se lagbhag 4500 screens main yah film relies kii jane vaali he, vahi hindi ke alaava mekars ise tamil, marathi or telegu bhashaaon main bhi relies kar rahe hai jisaki vajah se trade panditon ke mutabik is film ko bampar opening lene se koi nahin roak saktaa or tagada weekend collection ho saktaa he
 Now let us see if these fast-paced Star Box office's 100 million 'masterstroke' can be installed

 " bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah ne somvaar ko pashchim bengal ke jayanagar main ek chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit kiya
 He began his speech by targeting Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee
 shah ne kaha ki 'mamata didi kahati hai ki bengal main jai shriram nahin bol sakate
 i am speaking Jai Shri Ram from this platform and am going to Kolkata from here
 mamata didi himmat ho to giraftaar kar lenaa
 The BJP president said, "today i had to go to 3 places, i came to Jayanagar but in the second place was the seat of Mamata Didi's nephew
 vahaan hamaare jane se mamata ji darati hai ki bijepi vaale ikatthe honge to bhattije kaa takhta ulataa ho jayega isliye unhone hamaari sabha kii parmishan radd kar di
 'he said that Mamta didi in Bengal does not allow any benefit of any scheme of Modi ji's government, because Mamta didi believes that if these schemes started here, Modi ji will become more popular here
 jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue amit shah ne kaha, 'bengal kii janata ne tay kiya he ki wo is baar 23 se zyada siten hamaare netaa modi ji kii jholii main daalane ja rahe hai
 Mamta didi believes that she needs the votes of the infiltrators
 mamata didi ke raaj main durga puja kii anumati nahin milti, saraswati puja karne par unke gunde marpet karte hai
 Shah said that for the counting of votes to be held on May 23, on May 19, reverse Mamata's coup
 main guarantee detaa hum puure bengal main shaan ke saath phir se durga puja ho sake aisa maahaul yahaan bijepi kii sarkaar banaaegi
 Amit Shah said, 'mamta didi sent Urdu teachers in Islampur, Bengal
 logon ne jab urdu main padhane kaa virodh kiya to police bhej di, police ke atyaachaar se hamaare do kaaryakartaaon kii maut ho gai
 Whereas they were just demanding that there should be a study in Bengali
 agar bengal ke andar bengali bhashaa ko phir se prasthaapit karnaa he, to aapako camel ke nishaan kaa batan dabaakar bijepi ko jitaana padegaa
 Not a single new factory, new factory has come in Mamta Didi's rule in Bengal
 yahaan sirf bam banane ke kaarkaane bane hai
 Earlier Amit Shah's rally in Baruipur on Monday was canceled
 party ke ek pravaktaa ne bataaya ki yahaan raily ke liye kiraye par di gai jameen ke maalik ne aayojan ke liye apni sahmati waapas le lee jiske chalate raily ko radd karnaa padaa
 a BJP spokesperson said, the rally in Baruipur was canceled due to some reasons
 raily or saath hi helipad banane ke liye is jameen ko kiraye par liya gaya tha
 Apart from Baruipur, Amit Shah will also hold public meetings in Canning of South 24 Parganas and Rajarhat of North 24 Parganas
 anya do baithkon ke kaarykram main koi badlaav nahin kiya gaya
 On the other hand, BJP on Monday accused the Bengal government of not allowing party president Shah to rally in Jadavpur, saying that the Election Commission has become a mere 'silent spectator' of Trinamool Congress' alleged undemocratic methods of targeting the party
 bijepi media pramukh or rajyasabha saansad anil baluni ne bataaya ki party virodh pradarshan karegi or nirvachan ayog kaa darwaja bhi khatkhataayegi
 He said that Shah's rally was to be held in Jadhavpur on Monday, where the last phase of Lok Sabha elections is to be held on May 19
 rajya prashasan ne isaki anumati dene se antim minute par inkaar kar diya
 Baluni said that permission given to land Shah's helicopter has also been withdrawn
 unhone kaha, ‘yah durbhagyapurna he ki nirvachan ayog rajya main is tarah kii ghatnaon or trinmul kii ore se kiye ja rahe hinsa ke istemaal kaa keval mooldarshak ban gaya he
 Baluni alleged that the ruling party in the state was using undemocratic methods to target the BJP

 Every news of the election will be received directly in your inbox
 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator Ever since the news came out that Scindia is a strong contender for becoming the party's leader in the Lok Sabha, two camps have become active within the party
 ek khemaa wo he jo rahul gandhi ke kaaphi kareeb he or doosraa khemaa wo he jo sonia ke kareeb he, lekin bhavishya kii team rahul main jagah milane ko lekar aashwast nahin he
 After news of the name of Scindia, Rahul's close people believe that it would not be appropriate to make Rahul's leader and his fiery Scindia a leader when he was a Lok Sabha MP
 isse rahul ke kad par asar pad saktaa he
 This camp believes that Rahul should be seen leading from the front on every front
 isliye unheen ko pehle loksabhaa main party kaa netaa bananaa chahie
 This will also give them experience and they should become the president of the party
 is kheme ke tark he ki, sonia bhi party adhyaksh rahete hue vaajapeyi sarkaar ke dauraan loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa thim
 The second camp of the Congress has started cooking a separate khichdi
 sonia ke wo kareebi jo rahul kii team se baahar ho sakate hai unki alag hi ganit he
 Their effort is to keep Sonia as party president for maximum time
 isliye is kheme kii koshish he ki rahul hi loksabhaa main party ke netaa ban jaaen jisase ek vyakti ek pad kaa siddhant maanane kii baat karne vaale rahul khud hi kuch or din party adhyaksh pad se dur ho jaaenge or sonia kuch din or adhyaksh baniin rah jaaengi
 This camp also argues that being the president of Sonia, her seniority and stature will be more helpful in forming a grand alliance
 darasal, 2014 kii loksabhaa chunaav kii haar ke baad ek bhi chunaav aisa nahin he jo party ne jeeta ho or jiskaa sehara rahul gandhi ke sir par baandha jaae
 According to sources, both of them have agreed on one thing, Kisindhia should be made the party general secretary and from Madhya Pradesh, the general secretary should be sent as the state president, on which Kamal Nath also has consent
 congress main ghoshnaa se pehle naam li ho jane, baahar aane or usko rokane ke liye tamaam kheme sakriy ho jate hai
 Something similar is happening in the case of Scindia as well
 lekin, sonia takreeban man bana chuki hai
 Now just Rahul has to be stamped
 aise main koshish rahul se vito lagavane kii he
 Which seems difficult at the moment
 lekin jab tak ghoshnaa nahin hoti tab tak behaalcongress main halchalto machi rahane vaali he

 At Southampton, the Indian team lost the match by 60 runs, giving England a 3–1 winning lead in the five-match series
 england ke 245 ran ke lakshya kaa peechha karte hue bhartiya team 184 ran hi bana saki
 After this defeat, former India world captain Captain Kapil Devane said- 'cricket is a team game, it does not depend on one or two players
 viraat kohli istest sirismen 500 se zyada ran banaae hai, lekin iske baavjood akelaa viraat hi match jitaane ke liye paryaapt nahin
 Kapil said, 'you see that England captain Joe Root did not score as many runs in the series, yet the English team captured the series
 ' unhone kaha kitim indiyane ahm maukon par bahut si galtiyaan kii or ek ke baad ek lagaataar wicket ganvaae jo use mahangaa padaa
 "we ourselves gave England a chance to return
 According to the Telegraph report, Kapil said," If you look back in the series, you will know that we had enough chances to make the result of the match in our favor, but we made a lot of mistakes
 Key and invited England to return
 'kapil ne kaha, 'yah kahana bahut aasaan he ki hamane siries ganvaa di, kyonki england hamase zyada behatar cricket khelaa
 But, i still believe that we are a better team than them
 phir bhi, jaisaa ki maine kaha, unhone behatar pradarshan kiya
 Gavaskar had also raised questions, after the defeat in Southampton, former captain Sunil Gavaskar also questioned the performance of the Indian team
 gavaskar ne kaha ki 'viraat kii captaini main ab wo baat nahin he
 He said that in the year 2014, when Virat was given the captaincy of the Test team, he worked to give a new impetus and direction to the team
 'gavaskar ne kaha, lekin usee vakt se yah saaf tha ki viraat kii asal pariksha australia, england or dakshin africa main hogi, kyonki westeindies yaa srilanka jaisi tiimon ko haraana koi badi baat nahin, wo siries to team india ke liye practice maichon kii tarah thim
 Gavaskar said that as a batsman, Virat has done better than expected but the captain can succeed only when his team performs
 viraat kohli se hameshaa ummiden bahut oonchi rahati hai or is baar bhi kuch aisa hi hua
 This is the reason that cricket lovers from all over the country are disappointed with this defeat
 'purv captain sunil gavaskar ne kaha, ki 'yah haar niraashajanak he or isaki samiksha kii jaani chahie
 We have to see which players are needed by the team and who can be eliminated
 'yah record banane se chuki team indiaapako bataa den ki is baar viraat kii captaini vaali team india ke paas 11 saal baad england kii dharti par test siries jeetne kaa acha mauka tha or saal 2007 main rahul dravid kii captaini main siries jeet ke baad team ko yahaan siries jeet kii ummid thi, lekin ballebaaji main lachar pradarshan se usne yah mauka ganvaa diya

 Akhilesh Yadav, the chief of the Samajwadi Party, will arrive in Jhansi district of Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday to meet his family members after an incident of allegedly shooting a 28-year-old encounter by the police
 jahaan police kaharahi thi ki shaks ne pehleek adhikari par goli chalaai, vahiin uske parivaaravaalon ne daawa kiya he ki rishwat dene ke liye manaa karne par use maar diya gaya
 Protests are being held in the area after the incident

 The man escaped after firing on the police but his car was stopped after a few hours
 police kaa daawa he ki usne sarender karne se inkaar kar diya or phir se firing kii koshish kii, isi vajah se use goli maar di gai
 However, his family members have alleged that the police in-charge of the area, Dharmendra Chauhan, demanded a bribe of Rs 2
5 lakh in lieu of the seized truck
 parivaar ke logon kaa kahana he ki khulaasa karne kii dhamkee dene par usne pushpendra yadav kii hatya kar di
 Pushpendra Yadav's wife told NDTV that he (pushpendra Yadav) had given some money earlier, but the inspector was demanding more money
 police ne isliye goli maar di, kyonki unhone paise dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 i want justice police ne somvaar ko unke parivaar ke sadasyon ke virodh pradarshan ke bich pushpendra yadav ke shav kaa antim sanskaar kar diya, jinhone antim sanskaar karne se inkaar kar diya tha or maang kii thi kiencounter main shaamil logon ke khilaaf hatya kaa maamla darj kiya jaae

 ''mangalvaar kii dopaher upi police ne pushpendra yadav ke khilaaf pehle darj hue maamalon kii suchi twit kii, jo uske criminal record ko darshata he
 But if seen, most of these were cases related to rural-level disputes

 The Islamabad High Court has rejected the decision to keep Lakhvi in custody in another case despite getting bail in the Mumbai attack case

 aksar jab 'bhojpuri' kaa zikr aata he to kuch log ise ashleelata se jod dete hai
 Expressing concern over this image of Bhojpuri, Munna Pandey, assistant professor at Delhi University, explained the reason to cassette culture
 unhone kaha ki ashleel gaanon ke jariye guddu rangila, nirahua or manoj tiwari sareekhe lokgayakon kii vajah se bhojpuri kii aisi chhavi bani he
 Munna Pandey said that these people are rapists of language

 Today, despite being close to words, Maithili is not a dialect
 isliye avadhi, matholi, bhojpuri ek swatantra bhashaa hai, hindi kii boli nahin hai
 Amarendra Tripathi said that there is no significant difference between language and dialect
 ek boli jiskaa vyakaran ho, sahitya ho or use bolne vaale kii acchhee khaasi aabaadi ho wo bhashaa ban jaati he
 If the language becomes strong then it becomes the language
 munna pandeya ne kaha ki bharat ke sandarbh hindi ko lekar jis tarah se varchasv kii ladaai he, yah dar ki yadi bhojpuri aathvin anusuchee main aa gai to hindi kaa nuksaan ho jayega yah galat avadharana he
 In response to a question, he said that Hindi did not suffer due to the separation of Maithili

 Similarly, local languages in Pakistan lost their identity due to Urdu nationalism
 amrendra ne kaha ki hindu kii dukaan chalaani he to kaho hindu khatre main he, islam kii dukaan chalaani he to kaho islam khatre main he, isi tarah hindi ko khatra bataaya jaataa he
 Now these shopkeepers cannot fight English because they have to teach their children in English, so there is a danger from those who raise voices for small languages

 These include copper and gold to manganese and rare earth elements (REE)

 Unlike China, India has not developed any basis of production of rare earth minerals on the same scale
 atmanand bataate hai ki bharat ke paas cobalt or nikal ke jamini bhandar bhi nahin hai
 He says, "much remains to be done to get on par with developed countries like America, Japan and France

 Scientists hope that this new submarine will be able to go to a depth of 11,000 meters, the deepest parts of the ocean floor
 he jongue kehete hai ki bharat or china ke saamne ek jaisi chunautiyaan hai
 Giving less importance to the possibility of competition, he says, "COMRA is ready to cooperate with India in every respect

 pichley paanch saal main ghate vaali companiyon kii list lagaataar badhati gai he
 The central government has decided to close 19 loss making public sector companies
 do badi sarkari companiyon BSNL or air india kii haalat behad khasta he or inhen kabhi bhi band kiya yaa bechaa ja saktaa he
 Due to all this, there is a crisis of millions of employees becoming unemployed

 The decision to close these government companies has been approved by the Modi government to close more than 15 public sector companies
 ye sabhi companiyaan ghate main chal rahi hai
 According to a report of Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on psus a few years ago, these companies incurred a loss of more than Rs 30,000 crore in the year 2016-17 itself
 sansad main baari udyog or lok udhyam mantralay ke mantri arvind ganpat saamvat ne haal main bataaya ki baari udyog vibhaag tungabhadra steel products limited, echemati waches limited, echemati chinar waches limited, echemati bearings limited, hindustan cabals limited, echemati limited kii tractor unit or instrumentation limited kii kota unit jaisi 19 companiyon ko band karne kii manjuuri sarkaar kii ore se de di gai he
 'click here for detailed coverage of Budget 2019' Apart from this, companies like Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited, Indian Drugs Department of Pharmaceuticals, and Rajasthan Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, which are incurring losses under the Ministry of Shipping, also close the government
 Is preparing iske alaava do badi saarvajanik companiyon beasenel or air india ko bhi band karne yaa bechney kii majaburi ho sakati he
 a large number of these employees will have to lose their jobs or be forced to retire
 aise main sawaal yah he ki in berozegaar logon ke liye sarkaar ke paas kya plan he? bajet se is par kuch roshni pad sakati he
 What is the option with the finance minister? Now the government companies do not have to be shut down and the government can delist some of its loss-making companies from the stock market so that employees do not face problems
 in companiyon kii stratagic cell se zyada keemat mil sakati he
 Market regulator SEBI has made minimum 25% public shareholding mandatory for all listed companies
 isliye sarkaar ke liye aisa karnaa majaburi bhi he
 The government holds more than 90 per cent stake in many companies
 inamen fertiligers and chemical travankor limited (FACT), andrul and company limited or echemati limited shaamil hai
 Of these, FACT and HMT are loss making
 iske alaava scooter india main bhi sarkaar kii 93 percent hissedari he, jise teen saal profit main rahane ke baad vitt varsh 2017 main 10
 There was a loss of Rs 28 crore
 vah non stratagic public sector units ko bechnaa chaahati he
 Among the companies that have been approved for disinvestment by the government include more than 25 companies
 in companiyon main cell, echpiel or hindustan corporation limited jaisi companiyaan shaamil hai
 Apart from this, the Finance Minister can announce any package for the employees who are closed
 beasenel jaisi ghate main chal rahi kai companiyon main viares lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 In most such loss making companies, they can be relieved by implementing attractive VRS packages for the employees
 aisi companiyon main zyaadaatar karmchaaree 45 saal se zyada umr ke hote hai, isliye unako aise viares package se raahat mil sakati he
 Apart from this, many employees can also be accommodated in other government departments
 aise karmchaariyon ko nijee kshetra main naukari mili, iske liye sarkaar nijee companiyon ke liye kisi protsaahan yojana kii ghoshnaa kar sakati he
 In addition, special priority can be given under the Mudra scheme to employees who build their businesses or enterprises
 desh kii seva karne vaale aise karmchaariyon ke lakhon parijanon ko is baat kaa besabri se intjaar he ki vitt mantri unhen kya saugat detii hai
 The budget presented on Friday will make it clear what the government does for them

 uttarakhand main sab kuch he jo isko desh ke sabase adhik viksit rajyon main ek bana saktaa he lekin yahaan ek aisi sarkaar kii jarurat he jo isaki kshamtaaon kaa sahi upyog kar sake
 BJP could not do this
 unhone kaha ki congress hi ekmaatr aisi party he jo uttarakhand kii kshamtaaon kaa bharpoor istemaal kar isko vikaas ke raste par le ja sakati he
 Singh said, "you must definitely consider which party's government can bring economic social development in this state
" ise khushhaal bana sakati he

 People were afraid of the difficulties in the world, but we do not have to be troubled by these difficulties because we are able to face these difficulties well

 Uttarakhand has everything that can make it one of the most developed states in the country, but there is a need for a government that can utilize its capabilities properly

 He said that the Congress is the only party that can make full use of the capabilities of Uttarakhand and take it on the path of development

 The present term of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will be considered to be important in the political history of the country because the party with which he defeated the opposition party formed the government again in one and a half years
 duusari taraf chunaav main sahyogi rahe dal ko vipaksh main baithne par majaboor kiya
 On Saturday, Nitish Kumar's two-year tenure with the BJP will complete
 in do varshon main raajnneetik rup se nitish ko hue haani-laabh kaa yadi hisaab karen to ve nuksaan main jate dikhaai dete hai
 Two years ago, Nitish Kumar was considered a very strong leader in non-nda parties
 yahaan tak ki unhen pradhanmantri pad ke liye bhi prabal daavedaar mana jaataa tha
 Nitish Kumar, who continues to be a challenge for PM Narendra Modi, is seen playing the naiya of Bihar's power on his mercy
 1
 The biggest achievement, if one is to be believed, is that the image of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as the head of governance has been restored in Bihar
 rajd ke saath beete shasankaal main unka prabhaav kamjor hua tha
 Due to the habit of running the government parallel to RJD President Lalu Yadav and his intervention, there was confusion among officers and employees from the Secretariat to the block
 2
 The ministers now seem serious about the work of the department
 har mantri apane vibhaag ke prati javabdeh he
 Whose absence was seen during the rule with the RJD
 us samay lalu yadav ne apane donon beton tejpratap or tejasvi ke khate main adhikansh vibhaag le liye the or vibhaagon kii filon kaa nishpaadan lalu yadav kii ankhon ke saamne ghar se hota tha
 Alam was that the health department had the responsibility of Tej Pratap Yadav who was busy with Krishna and sometimes Shiva Leela
 unki harkaton ke kaaran sarkaar hameshaa surkhiyon main rahati thi
 3
 sabase badi baat he ki gathbandhan ke naam par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko ab kisi adhikari ke transfar yaa posting main apane nirnay ke liye sahyogi kii sahmati nahin lenaa hoti
 His decision is valid for everyone
 iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki bijepi ke jo mantri hai ve apane man mutabik adhikariyon ke transfar yaa posting nahin kara sakate, lekin ve iske liye ab mukhyamantri se aagrah karte hai
 Whereas Lalu Yadav considered it his right to have his own personal posting of officers, most of whom were tainted
 4
 When the assembly session starts, now the ministers of each department give some answers to the questions of their respective departments
 jabaki mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar main kai vibhaagon ke mantri tejpratap yadav ke liye kisi na kisi ko adhikrut kiya jaataa tha ki ve sadan main unke vibhaag ke sawaalon kaa jawaab den
 Tej Pratap himself used to sit in the house and play flute with friends
 iske kaaran sarkaar kii kaafii kirakiri hoti thi
 5
 kendra or bihar main ek hi gathbandhan kii sarkaar hone ke kaaran kai maamalon main ab jaldi rigelt dekhne ko miltaa he
 Work has started on several development projects and many new projects have also been started at the request of the state
 jaise patna main metro rail pariyojna, darbhanga airport kaa nirmaan kaary, bhagalpur main vikramshila sethu ke samanaantar nae sethu ke nirmaan kaary ko manzuri aadi
 1
 jab bhi mauka mila pradhanmantri narendra modi ne mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko raajnneetik rup se unka kad chota karne kaa koi avasar nahin ganvaaya
 The earliest example of this was seen at the convocation ceremony of Patna University when Prime Minister Narendra Modi publicly rejected the appeal of the Central University status to Patna University despite repeated requests from Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 Was
 iske alaava unhone vahaan jo bhi ghoshnaa, kii aaj tak us par amal nahin ho paaya he
 2
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad jab kendriya mantrimandal main jagah dene kii baat ai to nitish kumaar ke anupatik pratinidhitiv dene kii maang ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne khaarij kar diya or do took shabdon main unhen anya sahyogiyon kii tarah cabinet main ek pad lene kaa ofer diya
 Whereas during this Lok Sabha election, Nitish Kumar did not release his manifesto while maintaining the coalition religion
 vivaadaaspad muddon par patrkaar unase sawaal puuchhenge or jawaab se koi galat sandesh na chalaa jaae, iske liye nitish kumaar ne media se duuri bhi banaae rakhi
 Despite this, when Bihar got 40 seats, but even then Prime Minister Narendra Modi ignored Nitish Kumar's words
 3
 As far as the government of double engine is claimed, it has so far proved to be hollow
 jab bhi bihar ko kuch vishesh madad kii aavashyaktaa hoti he to centre sarkaar apana haath peeche kar leti he
 There are two vivid examples of this
 2017 main jab baadh ai to bihar sarkaar ne jamkar baadh peediton ke bich raahat kaam chalaaya
 When it came to financial help from the Center, the amount given was so low that no one wants to talk about it
 doosraa jab is varsh bihar main chamaki bukhaar se bacchon kii maut hui tab yah baat khulkar saamne ai ki centre sarkaar ne paanch varsh purv jo bihar se vaada kiya tha ki mujaffarpur main bacchon ke liye isiu kaa nirmaan karaayegi, use puraa karne kii kabhi zarurat nahin samajhi
 Similarly, five years ago, the Finance Minister announced the construction of another AIIMS in Bihar, which has not been laid to this day, because where it will be built, it is going on
 4
 In Bihar, Nitish Kumar broke his connection with Lalu Yadav by making corruption an issue, but the truth is that whether he is Tejashwi Yadav and Lalu Yadav or others in his family, till date in the case of scams against him, no further talk Has been made duusari baat bhrashtachar par nitish or bijepi bhi gambhir he
 This can also be gauged from the fact that soon after the formation of the government, a creation scam was revealed in 2017, which Nitish Kumar immediately gave to the CBI
 lekin is ghotaale main kai BJP netaaon or janata dal united ke bhi kuch netaaon ke naam saamne aae or shaayad aaj desh main yah pehla ghotaalaa he jisamen CBI ne kareeb ek darjan chargeshit daayar kar di hai
 But Priya and Amit, the main accused in this scam, have not been arrested till date
 jabaki ve desh main hi hai
 After all, what is the compulsion of the CBI to not arrest these accused is incomprehensible
 jaise rajd shashan kaal main adhikansh mantri bina paise liye kaam nahin karte the vaise hi bhaajapa ke saath is baar ke sushasan main bhrashtachar upar se neeche tak vyaapt hai
 The number of honest ministers is not more than five
 5
 When Nitish Kumar went back with the BJP, there was a hope that Bihar might get special state status but nothing like this happened
 khud pradhanmantri narendra modi, jo hameshaa apni har sabha main bolte rahe hai ki jab tak bihar jaise rajya viksit rajyon kii shrenee main nahin aaenge tab tak desh kaa vikaas sahi myanon main nahin mana jayega, lekin abhi tak centre kii taraf se aisi koi ichhashakti nahin dikhi jisase lage ki bihar main dabl engine kii sarkaar safal he
 On the other hand, there have been many cases of mob lynching or communal tension in Bihar in which people belonging to organizations related to BJP or RSS had active role
 aisa pehali baar dekhne ko mila jab sarkaar main sahyogi sarkaar ke liye mushkil badha rahaa he
 Ten years after the creation of Jharkhand, votes will be cast for the first time in the state on Sunday for panchayat elections
 kadi suraksha or chaukasee ke bichravivaar kopanchayat chunaav ke pehle charan kaa shubharambh hoga
 State Chief Secretary AK Singh told reporters, "panchayat elections will be held in the state after 32 years
 panchayat vyavastha ke nahin hone se rajya ne pichley kai saalon main centre kii taraf se vikaas ke liye di jane vaali kai sau karod kii raashi kho di he
 Now we have the opportunity to promote development works in the state through the election of Panchayati Raj
 ’gauratlab he ki rajya main paanch charnon main panchayat ke chunaav hone hai
 426 companies of security forces have been deployed to maintain security in elections

 But the way Team India piled on 112 runs ahead of Sri Lanka, there was no hope
 team nahin de pai shaadi par kohli ko jeet giftdrasal agar aaj dharmashala main team india bagaiyr regular captain ke pehle vanade main jeet hasil kar leti to kohli ko team india kii taraf se ye sabase shandaar shaadi gift hota
 But Kohli must have been shocked for a moment to hear the crushing defeat that the team got
 agar team india pehle vanade main jeet se aagaaj karti to shaayad kohli bhikhushi se jhumuthate, or shaadi se pehle unke liye team india or apane sahyogiyon kii taraf se 'jeet' tohfe main mil jaati, lekin aisa ho na sakaa
 There have been many occasions when Kohli had taken away the match from the opposition team on his own and put it in India's bag, but today no player other than Dhoni appeared fighting in the field
 shaayad ladane se pehle hi khilaadiyon ke man main haar kaa dar ghar kar gaya tha
 Kohli had his hand on the birthday too! Earlier, on the 4th of last month i
e
 (4th November), the second T20 match between India and New Zealand was played at the cricket ground in Rajkot and in this match Team India lost by 40 runs
 Hui
 aap soch rahe honge ki is match kaa yahaan zikr kyon? zikr jaruri he kyonki agle din yani 5 november ko viraat kohli kaa janmdin tha, agar team india is tii-20 mukaable ko jeet jaati to team kii ore se captain ko yahi sabase bada berthde gift hota
 
 
 
 to berthde jashn ho jaataa dugunalekin us vakt bhi haar naseeb hui thi
 Had the team won, the birthday celebration would have doubled
 lekin aaj kii tarah hi us din bhi baaki khilaadi maidan par kohli kaa saath nahin de paae
 And till the last moment, Kohli kept fighting on the field alone
 kohli ke out hote hi jeet haar main badal gai
 Where did that team's brilliant batting take place? Ever since the match started today at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium, there has never been a rhythm in Team India
 maidan main hameshaa viraat kohli kii kami khal rahi thi
 And it can be said with the claim that if Kohli were on the field today, the result would have been different
 kyonki jis tarah se team india nesrilanka ke aage ghutnetech die ye shaayad kohli ke hote hue sambhav nahin hota
 Sri Lanka took a 1-0 lead in the 3 ODI series over the hosts with a 7-wicket win in Dharamsala ODI
 dilli ke PWD ghotaalaa maamle main anti karpshan beuro (ACB) ne guuruuvaar kii subah arvind kejariwal ke rishtedaar vinay bansal ko giraftaar kiya he
 Vinay Bansal is the son of Surendra Bansal, daughter-in-law of Kejriwal
 surendra bansal kii pichley saal maut ho gai thi
 An FIR was registered in the ACB on 8 May 2017 in this corruption case
 jaankaree ke mutabik, asibi ko shikaayat mili thi ki surendra bansal ne renu construction company ke naam par PWD main farjivada kiya tha
 He had obtained the PWD tender at an estimated cost of 4 lakh 90 thousand and 46 percent below
 unke dwaara karaae gaye road or siver ke kaam kii quality bhi thik nahin hone kii baat kahi gai thi
 In this investigation, Mahadev came to know of buying cement and iron from the company, but there was no business from this company
 vinay bansal apane pita surendra bansal ke saath 50 fisadi kaa partner tha
 It was asked which company Mahadev was
 iskaa usne koi santoshjanak jawaab nahin diya
 After this the ACB arrested him
 is maamle main pichley saal 8 may ko surendra, vinay bansal or PWD ke kai adhikariyon ke khilaaf teen maamle darj kiye gaye the
 On May 13, six PWD engineers were questioned by the ACB

 Many fake bills were imposed
 dilli sarkaar ne bataaya raajnneetik sajeeshavinay bansal kii giraftaar par dilli sarkaar ne ek note jari kar ise raajnneetik sajeesh bataaya he
 It is written in the note that on Thursday the ACB arrested Vinay Bansal, a relative of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 is maamle ke tathyon se yah spasht ho jayega ki giraftaar puri tarah se raajnneeti se prerit he
 Vinay Bansal told passive partner Vinay's father Surendra Bansal's company had been working with PWD for many years
 vinay company main ek niskriy bhagidaar hai
 His company was given the task of building a drain by PWD
 naalee company dwaara banaai gai thi
 The third party certification of the construction was done by IIT Roorkee
 peedblyoody ne puraa pramaan patr bhi saunp diya
 'FIR filed under conspiracy' Following this, in 2017, an FIR was registered against the company under a political conspiracy, in which the construction work of the drain was not executed
 exiaar ke baad asibi ne shriram labs ke madhyam se kaam kii jaanch kii, jisane kaam ko clin chit di
 The stand of the PWD was also consistent that the work was completed
 'kejariwal ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh'usee saal surendra bansal kaa nidhan ho gaya
 After that no action was taken in this matter
 lekin achaanak is maamle main asibi ne vinay bansal ko giraftaar kar liya
 While the project got a clean chit from a reputed agency and PWD department
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke naam ko badnaam karne ke liye asibi kaa raajnneetik upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 Know, what is the whole matter? An NGO called Road Anti Corruption Organization had alleged that Arvind Kejriwal had given government contract for several construction works to his brother-in-law Surendra Kumar Bansal between 2014 and 2016
 isamen kai farji company banaakar karodon kaa kaam dikhaaya gaya or phir kaagajon par hi kaam dikhaakar paise hadap liye gaye
 Viphav Awasthi, a journalist associated with the same NGO, told that "more than 150 rtis were put on our behalf, but no information was given from the concerned departments"
 aarope he ki arvind kejariwal ke sadhu surendra bansal ne renu construction ke naam se company banaai or phir mahadev impex se saamaan kharida hua dikhaaya
 'business on paper only' Mahadev Impex showed in the information given to SAIL tax department that the company neither did any business nor took any merchandise from anyone nor sold the goods to anyone else
 yani naale banane se lekar construction tak kaa kaam sirf kaagajon par hua or paisa sarkaar ke fund se diya gaya
 The NGO had also accused the Kejriwal government of disturbing the rules
 vartmaan main bharat ke paas sabase tej-tarraar dimag vaale log hai
 But we are using them to solve the problem of the whole world
 kya aap apane desh ke liye bhi kuch karnaa chaahate hai? agar apane desh kii samasyaon se pareshaan hai or uske samaadhaan ke liye aapke paas he idia to bharat sarkaar degi aapako 20 lakh rupee

 The matter started with a debate and immediately reached Dhakkamukki
 khaas baat ye ki maukey par donon hi partiyon ke duusare bade netaa bhi maujuud the
 People on both sides kept watching this rash at Dehradun Airport
 lekin jab donon taraf se is mudde par sawaal puche gaye, to jawaab ek-duusare par iljaam ke taur par hi saamne aae
 Now, if you explain these leaders, what should you explain? desh ke hajaaron log tabaahi se sahame hue hai or ye netaa hai ki us tabaahi ko bhi apni siyaasi roti senkane kii aag banane se nahin kataraa rahe hai
 'jodi Breakers' released today is the story of two youngsters who divorce those who are unhappy with marriage
 
 
 ek he dyvorce export cid, yani madhavan, jo khud shaadi ke bure tajurbe ke baad talaak le chukaa he, or duusari he sonaali, yani bipasha basu, jo apane dukhi maa-baap tak kaa talaak kara chuki he
 
 
 But the real story begins when these two together separate a happy married couple
 
 
 tippaniyan In director Ashwini Chaudhary's 'jodi Breakers', Sid and Sonali break up the pair with fun, which is a good comedy in the first half
 
 
 sabase mazedaar kissa ek pahalwaan kaa he, jisaki bivi ko zarurat se zyada pyaar chahie
 
 
 Like 'three Idiots', in 'jodi Breakers' too, Omi Vaidya has laughed in a wrong Hindi speech
 
 
 bich-bich main glamras dance numbers manoranjan bhi karte hai
 
 
 Good romantic scenes have been shot on Bipasha and Madhavan, and especially Bipasha has returned with freshness and beauty
 
 
 interval ke baad kahani main mode aa jaataa he, jo uljhaae rakhata he
 
 
 Light takes the place of a comedy romantic drama in the second half, and from here the film looks a bit tired, but here Helen lives in a small role
 
 
 jis dhang se 'jodi brakers' jodiyaan todate hai, vah bhi asaliyat se dur he, lekin kamedi main chal jaataa he
 
 
 Overall 'pair breakers' is the entertainment package, and our rating for this is 3 stars

 'thri idiyats' kii tarah 'jodi brakers' main bhi omi vaidya ne galat hindi main bhaashan dekar hansaaya he
 
 
 The intermittent glamorous dance numbers also entertain
 
 
 bipasha or madhavan par achche romantic seens filmaae gaye hai, or khaskar bipasha nai taazgi or khubsuurati ke saath lauti hai
 
 
 There is a twist in the story after Interval, which keeps it complicated
 
 
 second half main kamedi kii jagah letaa he lite romantic drama, or yaheen se film thodi thakee hui lagati he, lekin yahaan helen chote se role main jaan daalati hai
 
 
 The manner in which 'pair breakers' break pairs is also far from reality, but goes into comedy

 uttar pradesh ke muradabad jile kii minather thana kshetra main buudhvaar ko chacrores kii paimaaish karne gai prashasnic or police team par jaanaleva hamalaa kiya gaya
 In this case, the police has arrested three people including the woman

 After receiving the complaint letter, the administrative and police team arrived on Wednesday to settle the case
 tippaniyan During this time, as soon as Lekhpal Shahbaz Alam started the measurement, Rajpal, Rajaram and Kumari Reena, who were present on the spot, attacked Lekhpal Shahnawaz and the police team with a sickle and a shovel

 ) Playing the lead role in the film Jal, Poorab Kohli, Kirti Kulkarni, Tannishtha Chatterjee, Mukul Dev, Ravi Gosain and Yashpal Sharma
 'jal' kahani he, bakka kii, jise marusthal ke log jal kaa devtaa maanate hai or jo sirf man kii shakti se marusthal main jal dhund nikaalata he
 Bakka means Purab Kohli lives in his friend's and his sister's house and his friend's sister Kajri ie Tannishtha Chatterjee wants him in his heart, but Bakka's choice is Kesar Kirti Kulkarni of Kesar village
 bakka kii prem kahani to film main ek chota par mahatvapurn ansh he, par 'jal' kahani he, marusthal main pyaas se jujhate insaan kii, jahaan rupaya, paisa, jevar se zyada keemat he pani kii
 In the film, Saida Jules, who comes to Russia as a tourist, gets upset to see that the Flamingos in Ranch of Kutch are dying of salt water and she decides to save them
 sarkaar kii madad se pani nikaalane kii mashine mangvayi jaati hai or jal kaa devtaa bakka pani khoj nikaalata he jabaki aadhunik takanic bakka ke hunar ke aage maat kha jaati he
 'jal' also gives a message with entertainment that the world and country are worried about flamingos, but not humans dying of thirst
 sabase pehle main tarif karnaa chaahunga cinemetographer sunita radia kii, jinhone bahut-hi khubsuurati se ran of kuccha ko filmaaya he
 After that played Tanishta and Keerthi
 mukul dev ne bhi apni khalanaayak kii bhoomika bakhubi nibhaai he
 Purab is also good in his character, but the desert is not able to mix with his face and pieces with the rest of the villagers
 shaayad unhen kuch din vaaki marusthal main rahane kii jarurat thi, nahin to mechap par thodaa or kaam karnaa chahie tha
 Moments of the film slow down the story and perhaps it is also because the moments that have been tried to create comedy by dissolving the comedy, we have seen many before, like the attraction of the village towards Gori Mem
 angreji na samajhane kii vajah se kamedi laane kii koshish
 i wish some new tricks were tried for comedy
 saath hi kuch actors thode laud the, yani unki acting rangamanch kii acting lagati he, lekin phir bhi yah film aapako baandhe rakhti he
 Directing Girish Malik's good effort requires a little grip and direction
 sonu nigam or bikram ghosh kaa acha sangeet or screen play
 Overall, this 'jal' will quench the thirst of the audience, who are accustomed to drinking sweet water rather than Bollywood saline

 The story of the film is made on the plot of how a person at that time helped evacuate 1 lakh 70 thousand Indians settled in Kuwait

 President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were also present at the inauguration
 centre sarkaar ne is varsh june main indian mujahidin ko aatankwaadi sanghathan ghoshit kar pratibandhit kar diya tha or iske baad pehali baar varanasi main visphot kaa daawa kar vah phir sukhiryon main aa gaya he
 The Indian Mujahideen is suspected to have been involved in ten serial blasts in Delhi and explosions in other parts of the country, killing around 500 people
 aadhikarik sutron ne kaha ki indian mujahidin pratibandhit simi or pakistan sthit lashkar e taiyaba kaa chaaya sanghathan he or sidhe taur par vah pakistan ke iesai se niyantrit hota he
 Banning the group, the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement, "an order has been issued to include the Indian Mujahideen and all related organizations in the list of Illegal Activities (prevention) Act 1967"
 ’’ isko shaamil karne ke saath hi aise sanghathanon kii sankhya 35 ho gai he, jisamen alqaida, littey, jaish e mohammad, hijbul mujahidin, bhakpa maovadi or ulpha shaamil hai

 In a report presented in Parliament on Thursday, the CAG has questioned the role of the government from Air India, the Ministry of Civil Aviation and said that the deal was motivated by the seller
 badi sankhya main vimaan kharidne kii pahal ko jokhimaura kadam bataate hue rapat main kaha gaya he ki isse sarkaar ke kaan khadey ho jane chahie the
 The purchase of these aircraft brought the burden of heavy debt liability of Rs 38,423 crore on the airline till March last year
 rapat main sarkari ankekshak ne air india or indian airlines ke vilay ko galat samay main kiya gaya vilay qaraar diya he
 It was a feast on the crisis and should have raised the ears of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and Planning Commission, the report said
 kaig ne vimaanan company ke prabandhan ke sambandh main sarkaar ko puri tarah se vyaavhaarik rukh apnaane kaa suzav diya
 The CAG found in the investigation that the acquisition process took an unreasonably long time
 kaig ne kaha ki shuruaati prastaav disambar, 1996 main kiya gaya tha or isaki samiksha janvari, 2004 tak jari rahi jab 28 vimaanon kii kharid kii yojana taiyaar kii gai or baad main isamen badlaav kar 68 vimaan kharidne kaa nirnay kiya gaya
 The CAG said that the revised plan had dramatically increased the number of aircraft to be purchased and the developments that took place by November 2004 showed that Air India acted in haste on its earlier plan before the merger
 rapat main kaha gaya, bazaar kii jaruraton jisamen tatkaaleen jarurat or bhavi jarurat shaamil hai or saath hi in adhigrahan ke liye jo tark die gaye hai unki vyavsaayik vyaavhaaryata vimaanon kii sankhya main vruddhi ko lekar kiye gaye ankekshan kii jaanch main sahi nahin baithte
 The CAG commented on the fast pace of the 68 aircraft procurement process, saying that while it took 8 years to decide on the first plan for the purchase of 28 aircraft, a second plan was prepared by Air India between August 2004 and December 2005
 It was approved by the Board, reviewed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Planning Commission, Department of Expenditure, Public Investment Board, Empowered Group of Ministers and Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs
 The levy tax was approved
 sanshodhit yojana ke liye kai anumaanon ko doshapurn pate hue kaig ne kaha ki baatcheet kii prakriya aniyamit thi or isse prakriya kii paardarshita buree tarah prabhavit hui
 The CAG stated that no benchmark was set in relation to price comparison and business acumen
 is tarah ke benchmark kii anupasthiti main yah tay karnaa mushkil he ki kis tarah se keemat par pahunchaa gaya
 The government auditor put the Ministry of Civil Aviation in the dock for showing generosity in bilateral air traffic eligibility with countries not providing equal opportunities for development to Air India
 kaig ne kaha, is sthiti main air india sahit bhartiya vimaanan companiyon ko sthapit antarrashtriya diggaj vimaanan companiyon ke saath prabhavi tareeke se pratispardhaa karne main nayi evam gambhir chunautiyon se nipatna hoga
 The CAG also noted operational deficiencies, weak financials, inadequate equity capital and undue reliance on financing through loans, among other factors responsible for Air India's poor condition
 iske alaava, vimaan eendhan kii unchi keemten or vaishvik mandi se bhi vimaanan company buree tarah prabhavit hui
 The airline is in a crisis situation, CAG said
 vetan bhugtan or atief kii dendariyon kaa bhugtan karnaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 If the airline has to survive, management and employees must set aside personal interests and make some drastic decisions
