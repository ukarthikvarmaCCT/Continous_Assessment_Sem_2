 isaki screen nahin mudati he, lekin isamen do disple hai
 They are related to each other by Hinja
 duusari companiyaan jaise samsung or huaave disple ko hi mode rahe hai
 Although they also have a hinge, but they do not appear
 duusari taraf alji ne do disple vaala hi launch kiya he
 Yo phone supports 5G
 khaas baat ye he ki isamen die gaye donon disple ko aap said bai said yuj kar sakate hai
 For example, while watching video on one of its displays, you can use social media on another display
 is phone ko hamane yuj kiya he or live demo ke dauraan isamen 5G tech dikhaaya jo vaaki main kaaphi fast he
 Its specialty is that you can also zoom videos that are buffering live from the Internet
 juum karne se isaki quality kharaab nahin hoti he
 Not only this, you can set this zoom to appear in another screen
 isamen teen rier camere hai or camera modul ke thik neeche kii taraf fingerprint scinar diya gaaya he
 The phone is heavy to use and it looks heavy like the old Nokia model
 phone fold karne or open karne main smood nahin lagata he
 It looks like you are opening a device which is old, it can be made smooth
 acchhee baat ye he ki sirf ek screen yuj kar sakate hai or chahen to quick settings se select karke isaki donon screen ko shuru kar sakate hai
 Let us tell you that such dual display smartphones have been launched, but they are still not able to show anything amazing
 haal hi main vivo ne bhi aisa hi phone launch kiya tha
 However, this smartphone is definitely slightly different from the Vivo NEX Dual, as it can be folded and this phone comes under the category of smartphone with a foldable display

 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon se pehle hi congress ke mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar siddharmaiya ne dalit siem kaa daanv chalaa he
 After this, there are many Dalit faces of Congress, which is in the race of CM
 lekin sabase majbootee daavedaari mallikarjun khadge kii he
 With a clean image, Kharge becomes the first choice of allies ranging from the veteran and the party high command
 lekin ye tabhi hoga jab karnataka main congress bahumat ke jaadui aankade se dur rahati he
 Why is Siddaramaiah leaving the CM post for the Dalit? Let us tell you that all the exit polls are pointing to the hung assembly in Karnataka
 echdi devgauda kii party jedies kii bhoomika kingmekar vaali ho jaati he
 The JDS has a figure of thirty-six with Siddaramaiah
 aise main jedies unke naam par kisi bhi haalat main raji nahin hogi
 In order to prevent the JDS from going with the BJP, Siddaramaiah himself has made bets
 congress trishanku vidhansabha kii sthiti main jedies kaa samarthan hasil karne ke liye dalit siem card khel sakati he
 JDS will also not mind this bet of Congress
 isi baat ko samajhate hue siddharmaiya ne kaha, 'main dalit ke liye pad chhodane ko taiyaar hum
 If the high command wants, it can make a Dalit a CM
 iske liye mujhe koi aapatti nahin he
 Mallikarjun Kharge's claim is named after Mallikarjun Kharge as the main contender for the Congress after the statement of the strongman Siddaramaiah Maa Dalit CM
 khadge congress ke diggaj netaaon main shumaar kiye jate hai
 Apart from this, his name comes as a grassroots leader along with the Dalit face of the party in Karnataka
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav mallikarjun khadge ke naam ko aage badhaakar ladaa gaya tha
 This was the reason that Kharge's name was also included in cm's race after majority came
 lekin us samay raajnneetik haalat aise bane ki siddharmaiya ko siem bananaa party kii majaburi ban gai
 After this, Kharge was given the responsibility of national politics
 9 baar vidhayak do baar saansadabata den ki khadge svachh chhavi vaale netaa maane jate hai or 9 baar jitkar vidhayak ban chuke hai or duusari baar saansad hai
 He is a leader with long experience in the politics of Karnataka
 aise main dalit siem ke rup main khadge sabase prabal daavedaar maane ja rahe hai
 He was seen together during Rahul Gandhi's visit during the Karnataka assembly elections
 rahul apane bhaashan ko shuru karte to mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ke naam lene se pehle mallikarjun khadge kaa lete
 In such a situation, he can become the first choice of the party high command as the Dalit CM
 itnaa hi nahin rahul gandhi lagaataar desh bhar main dalit mudde ke jariye narendra modi or bijepi sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 What Kharge said, when he became CM, Khargemallikarjun Kharge said, "I will accept whatever decision the Congress high command takes after considering Siddaramaiah
 isse zyada main is masale par kuch nahin kahana chahta hum
 Congress leader Kharge said, "siddaramaiah's statement of making Dalit as Chief Minister has been distorted
 is bare main congress alaakaman vidhayak dal kii baithak main tay karenge
 Things will be cleared in just 12 hours
 iske baad haikaman jo tay karenga, wo hamako manjuur he
 Khadge lost his parents at the age of 6, Khadge has risen from the ground in politics
 unhone chaatr jivan se raajnneetik shuru karke yahaan tak kaa safar tay kiya he
 He lost his parents at the age of 6
 khadge ne apane jivan kaa ye haadasa bayaan karte hue kaha tha ki ab main 76 saal kaa hum or isliye in 70 saalon ko apni jindagi main atirikt hi maanata hum
 Let me tell you that Kharge was receiving some threatening calls, about this, he said that 'people think they will calm me down or stop me from doing my work
 unako yah pataa hona chahie ki shaayad usee vakt meri maut ho jaati jab main chah saal kaa tha or mere ghar main aag lag gai thi
 My parents and other relatives were killed
 'khadge congress ke liye trump cordkhadge kii saadagi or bebaaki unki sabase badi takat he
 Even after being in Karnataka politics for such a long time, there is no stain on his head
 itnaa hi nahin congress or rahul kii raajnneeti ke liye bhi khadge phayda kaa sauda sabit ho sakate hai
 Dalit voters are around 14 percent in the country
 modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad dalit utpeedan ke kai maamle saamne aae hai
 The Congress is continuously making efforts to integrate Dalit votes with itself
 rahul ne pichley dinon 'samvidhan bachaao' kaarykram kaa aagaaj kiya he
 Apart from this, no candidate was fielded before a Dalit leader like Jignesh Mevani, due to which he has been successful in becoming an MLA
 mallikarjun khadge ko siem banaakar desh main ek bada sandesh dene kii koshish karne kii manshaa bhi he

 '' Some people are raising questions on the Election Commission website on social media about the votes received by Congress President Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad seat
 fasebuk par viral ek post ke jariye daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki vynad seat par rahul gandhi ko 13 lakh se zyada vot mil rahe the, lekin asal rigelt main website se unke chah lakh vot gaayab kar die gaye
 Rahul got more than seven lakh votes in Wayanad seat and won here by 4 lakh 31 thousand votes, though Smriti Irani defeated him by about 55,000 votes in Amethi seat
 vynad seat kaa rigeltayahandekha ja saktaa he
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral claim was misleading
 chunaav ayog kii website ke anusaar vynad sansadeey kshetra main kul voter sankhya hi kareeb 11 lakh do hajaar he
 The archived version of the post can be viewed
 haalanki abtak is post ko delit kar diya gaya he
 Facebook page FEKU EXPRESS shared two screenshots of the Election Commission's website and claimed that 13,37,438 votes were shown on the first website in front of Rahul Gandhi's name in Wayanad, but later the figure was 734,888
 yani ki rahul gandhi ke kul 602,550 vot gaayab ho gaye
 In fact, on Thursday afternoon for some time, the statistics of the votes of Wayanad parliamentary constituency were shown wrong on the Election Commission website
 iske chalate rahul gandhi ko 13 lakh se zyada vot or peepi sunir ke naam ke aage kareeb chaar lakh vot najar aa rahe the
 However this error was quickly rectified on the website
 chunaav ayog kii varsh 2009 kireportke anusaar vynad sansadeey kshetra main kul 11,02,097 voters hai jinamein 543,764 purush or 558,333 mahilaayein shaamil hai
 The Wayanad parliamentary constituency was formed in 2009 and is composed of seven assembly constituencies in three districts — Wayanad, Calicut and Malappuram
 vynad kerala kaa sabase kam aabaadi vaala kshetra he
 According to the 2011 census, the total population here is 816,558
 aise main rahul gandhi ko 13 lakh vot milanaa sambhav hi nahin he
 a total of 10,92,197 people voted on this seat
 chunaav ayog ke ek adhikari ne "ajtak" ko bataaya ki website par disple erar tha jiske chalate vynad seat par aankade galat dikh rahe the, lekin is galati ko kareeb ek se dedh ghante main hi thik kar liya gaya tha
 The Election Commission gave a clean chit to Union Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal in the alleged violation of the code of conduct
 ayog ne apane faisle main kaha ki vah is baat ko lekar santusht he ki is tarah kaa bayaan dekar shriprakash jaisawal kaa matadaataaon ko daraane yaa dhamkaane kaa koi iraadaa nahin tha
 Therefore, the Commission has decided not to pursue the matter further
 ayog ne jaisawal ke jawaab or unke bhaashan ke video ricarding kii sidi dekhne ke baad apni baithak main unhen clin chit dene kaa nirnay kiya
 Significantly, on 24 February, the Commission had issued a notice to Jaiswal for alleged violation of the code of conduct regarding his remarks on President's rule in Uttar Pradesh and asked him to reply by 29 February
 jaisawal ne buudhvaar ko daakhil kiye gayi apane jawaab main aaropon se inkaar kiya tha or kaha tha ki unke bayaan ko tod marod kar pesh kiya gaya he or unhone daawa kiya ki unhone matadaataaon ko kabhi nahin dhamkaaya he
 The Commission had said in its notice that it seems prima facie that an attempt has been made to intimidate the voters by making the above statement that either their party votes for Congress or face the President's rule in Uttar Pradesh and by speaking so, they have given the ideal election Violated the code of conduct
 ayog kii yah karrwai bhaajapa or samaajawaadee party kii shikayaton ke maddenjar saamne aayi he
 The BJP had complained that Jaiswal had violated the election code of conduct by making such a statement
 kanpur se congress saansad jaisawal ne 23 farvari ko uttar pradesh ke paanchaven charan ke matdaan ke dauraan apana vot daalane ke baad patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha, ‘agar congress ko bahumat miltaa he to vah sarkaar banaaegi
 If we do not get a clear majority, we will sit in the opposition and i see no other option but President's rule

 dharm sansad ke is satr main manch se ram mandir nirmaan or jansankhya santulan se lekar goraksha jaise mudde uthaae gaye
 No proposal related to this relationship was passed in the Dharma Sansad, which was started by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat with the announcement of the construction of the temple in Ayodhya
 shuukravaar ko dharm sansad ke pehle din jab aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ko manch mila to unhone baaki tamaam muddon ke saath ram mandir ke masale par bhi apana paksh rakhaa

 babari masjid ection cameti ne bhi saaf taur par kaha ki ram mandir cese supreme court main vichaaradhin he, aise main aresas pramukh kaa ye bayaan nyaayalay ko chunauti dene vaala he
 However, on the last day of the Dharma Sansad, President of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Pravin Togadiyane also supported Bhagwat's statement
 togadiya ne kaha ki vivaadit sthal par sirf mandir kaa hi nirmaan hogi, vahaan masjid nahin banegi
 He also did not give any date
 lekin karnataka main viechpi ke ek duusare netaa ne mandir nirmaan kab shuru hoga, ye bhi bataa diya
 Gopal, an VHP official in Karnataka, claimed that the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya would begin in December next year

 VHP Joint General Secretary Surendra Jain, who came to join the Parliament of Religion, said that do we need any of this proposal? Jain said that from 1528 this is the resolve of every Hindu
 jain ne kaha ki ye prastaav nahin ection kaa vakt he
 He announced that the construction of the temple will begin in October 2018
 jain ne ye bhi kaha ki agali dharm sansad kaa aayojan ayodhya main hoga
 Proposal against cow slaughter Even if no proposal has been brought in the Parliament about the Ram temple, the demand for strict legislation for cow protection has been passed
 gujarat se akhileshwar das maharaj ne dharm sansad main gaay kii suraksha ke liye ek sakht kendriya kanoon kaa prastaav rakhaa tha, jise paas kar diya gaya
 After the Supreme Court's comment on Ram temple, many organizations have tried to settle the dispute outside the court
 ye prayaas nirantar chal rahe hai
 The Shia Waqf Board and spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar have also initiated this
 lekin dharm sansad main ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar koi prastaav nahin laayaa gaya
 However, the VHP leader made it clear from his statement that now is the time for action, not the proposal

 Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray said on Friday, "let the fourth war between India and Pakistan take place and Pakistan should be taught a lesson in it
" 'party ke mukhpatr saamana ke sampadakeey main thakare ne kaha ki pakistan purv main teen baar sabak sikh chukaa he, lekin usapar uskaa koi khaas asar padataa nahin dikhaai de rahaa he, isliye use phir se sabak sikhaane kii jarurat he
 The editorial of the Shiv Sena chief has come up recently on the recent remarks of Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
 sharif ne kaha tha ki yadi kashmir mudde kaa samaadhaan nahin hota he to parmaanu shakti se las donon padosiyon ke bich yuddh bhadak saktaa he
 Sharif later denied this
 thakare ne sharif ke kashmir raag kaa fori jawaab dene ke liye pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii saraahna kii he or kaha he, 'har bhartiya garv mahasoos karata he
 Quoting the Prime Minister's statement, Thackeray wrote, "it would be impossible for me to win any war for Pakistan
 ' manmohan singh ne sharif kii tippanee ko 'kashmir mudde kaa apane jite ji samaadhaan karne kaa yah unka (sharif kaa) sapana' qaraar diya
 Sharif also allegedly warned that the Kashmir issue should be resolved before a war between the two countries erupted
 thakare ne kaha he ki baad main pakistan ke pradhanmantri karyaalay ne bayaan se pallaa jhaad liya
 But this statement was waved in the country's media by then

 com / mqq5cuidxd — Manu Kaushik (@manukaushik) November 10, 2014 Brown recounts his childhood tales to the readers
 unhone bataaya ki kaise carch main organ (vaadya yantra) bajaane vaali unki maa or or ganit ke shikshak pita, din-ba-din unke liye dilachasp hote jate the
 While interpreting the pendulum between religion and science, Brown said that he had learned long before he asked questions
 or phir unhone yah kissa sunaaya, 'ek baar main pujari ke paas gaya or poocha ki vigyaan or bible hamen alag-alag chijen bataate hai, to phir sahi kya he? pujari ne kaha, 'achche bachche is tarah ke sawaal nahin poochhate
 'readers familiar with his collection of books were delighted by his life experience
 brown ne kaha ki sabase utsaah vaala samay vah hota he, jahaan dharm or vigyaan ke bich kii rekhaaen dhundhlee hone lagati hai
 He motivates people to investigate life's events a lot
 vah kehete hai, 'jab main apane aas-paas kii duniya ko dekhtaa hum, mere liye yah maananaa mushkil hota he ki yah yun hi sanyog se hua hoga
 In order to investigate the existence of objects and events, he said to explore science and religion together
 apane 30 minute ke vaktavy main unhone auditorium main maujuud logon ko sammohan main baandhe rakhaa
 After this he answered the questions of the people and the audience enjoyed the most
 langdon bharat kab aaenge?'dhairya rakhen
 Convincing his Indian fans, Dan Brown said, 'I have a lot to read about your religion and mythology
 abhi main yahaan (bharat main) starters ke liye hum
 'have you read Indian epics like Ramayana or Mahabharata? No, not yet
 darasal ye donon hi bahut zyada bade hai
 There is a murder in the first 5 pages of your novel? i want my readers to curse me that i have gone to their work and sleep
 main unhen panna-dar-panna aisa kuch dena chahta hum jo unhen kitaab band karne se roktaa rahe
 And nothing could be more shocking than the loss of life in my dictionary
 bataur lekhak apni yatra par?'likhnaa ekant kaa udhyam he
 Work done alone
 ' vah majaak main kehete hai, ' lekhak hone ke baad sabase bura pesha he, lekhakon kaa (jivan) saathi hona
 'on Religion vs
 Liberalism?' Read the scriptures as a reference point on how to live your life, not like facts
 yah sambhav he ki aap dharmik hone ke saath udaar bhi bane rahen
 'I have become one of these three things of Brown
 achche banelekhak salmaan rushdi ne brown kii kitaab 'da vinci code' ke bare main ek baar kaha tha, 'yah itani buree kitaab he ki yah buree kitabon ko bhi acha bataati he
 'when the program's moderator asked Brown about this, the bestselling author said with a unique smile,' He is a good man
 ' baat aage badhaate unhone kaha, 'ek kitaab kaa jaadu har shaks par alag-alag ho saktaa he
 Those whose mood is like you, they become your fans
 jinka nahin he, ve aalochak
 But you keep doing your work
 '2
 Wear blindfolds, always as a creative person, your own guide
 apni ankhon par pattee pahanen
 Do not listen to family and loved ones
 unke shabd aapako aalsee bana sakate hai
 Don't just listen to the critics too, they will make you insecure
 saamne kii ore dekhen or khud ke path-pradarshak bane

 Help is sought from the people so that they can take their procession to Thakur-dominated village of their bride
 15 march ko sanjay kumaar ne is bare main elahabaad hoicourt kaa darwaja khatkhataya he
 Sanjay Kumar says, 'the constitution says that we are all equal, and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath says that we are all Hindus
 ve ek hinduvadi party ke mukhiya hai
 Then why are we facing such a situation
 ' block deveopment council ke sadsy kumaar poochhate hai, 'kya main hindu nahin hum? ek samvidhan se chalane vaale desh main logon ke liye alag-alag niyam nahin ho sakate
 'there are only 20 days left in Kumar's wedding, but there is no solution to the problem
 pichley saptaah jila magistrate arapy singh ne espi piyush shrivastav ke saath dulhan ke gaanv nizamabad kaa daura kiya
 Nizamabad is in the neighborhood of Kansajj district
 donon adhikariyon ne us root kaa bhi daura kiya, jiske raste sanjay kumaar apni baraat le janaa chaahate hai
 But under pressure from the Thakurs, Singh did not allow them to carry the procession on the way
 district magistrate ne raste main maujuud naale, kooday or uski chaudaai kaa hawala dete hue baraat kii anumati nahin di he
 The officials also ascertained whether the Jatavs (sheetal and Sanjay are of the same caste) ever took out a royal procession before this
 lekin aisa koi udhaaharan nahin mila
 In such a situation, he advised the family members of Sheetal that the procession of Sheetal would come from the same traditional route, so far the procession of Dalits has been coming
 unhone thakuron se is baat ko sunishchit karne ko kaha he ki raste saaf rahen
 According to the Indian Express, the police have signed bonds of 11 Jatavs and Thakurs in this regard that no law will take over in the case
 thakuron ne har sambhav madad kaa aashwaasan diya he
 But Sheetal's family living on the outskirts of Nizamabad, like the other four Jatav families in the village, have decided to take the fight to the fore
 sheethal kii maa madhubala kahati hai, 'ye hamaare sammaan se judaa he, ham puure shaano shaukat se duulhe kaa swaagat karnaa chaahate hai or ye bhi ki duulhaa ghode par aae
 The roads of the village are as much ours as those of the Thakurs
 ''jatvon ke ubhaar ke saath shuru hua tanaav'baraat ko lekar ye jhagada tab badha, jab 45 pariwaron main 90 pratishat aabaadi vaale thakuron ke gaanv main jatvon ne apana dabadabaa bananaa shuru kiya
 All the members of Sheetal's family are in the BSP among the Jatavs considered bsp's vote bank
 march ke duusare saptaah main thakuron ne jatvon ke kheton kaa pani roak diya
 And in return, started giving water at Rs 100 per hour
 iske saath hi thakuron ne sheethal kaa certificate bhi nikalava liya or kaha ki abhi uski umr keval 17 saal or 10 maheene kii he
 Sanjay Kumar says that if this is the case, then we can postpone the wedding for two months till the completion of 18 years of Sheetal
 gaanv kii pradhan or jati se thakur kanti devi is baat ko sweekaar karti hai ki jiladhikari ke aane ke baad hi unhone jatvon ke kheton kaa pani kholaa
 She further says, 'we have no problem, the girl is married, Thakur people have no allergy
 dikkat ye he ki koi jabardastee hamaare raste par aayega or diwaar todega
 When ever the procession has not come out of our way, why are they doing the work of controversy
 ''apni chauhaddi paar na karen dalit'thakur sanjay singh kehete hai, 'thakuron or jila prashasan ne unhen samajhaayaa he ki ve maamle kii jad ko samajhen
 We have told them not to start a new thing now
 unki seemaa tay he or ve usee chauhaddi ke bheetar rahen
 'upper caste district magistrate Sanjay Singh is not ready to be upset with his statement
 ve kehete hai ki donon samudaayon ko aapas main nahin ladanaa chahie
 They are not Hindus and Muslims
 donon samudaay hindu hai
 The marriage of Hindus is not a compromise like Muslims, it is a sentiment in which the procession has no meaning
 saaf he ki jatav ladanaa chaahate hai
 We cannot change the tradition
 bijepi vidhayak devender singh, joki peshey se thakur hai, kehete hai, 'kumaar ko mere paas salaah ke liye aana chahie
 But that boy is leading main sarkari paise se samuhik vivaah main uski shaadi karvaa duungaa
 He insists that if you come in anyone's way, there will be a fight
 'daliton kii ichchhaaon ko dabaaya jaataa he: bispi netabspi leader ajay kumaar kehete hai ki prashasan ne kuch nahin kiya he
 Dalits like Sanjay Kumar have very few options left
 unke khilaaf gaanv ke bade bujurg paramparaon kaa hawala dekar bich-bachaav kar rahe hai
 Ajay says, 'dalits have long wanted to do their weddings in royal style
 lekin unki ichchhaaon ko hameshaa dabaaya gaya he
 But this time the groom is adamant
 'unhone daawa kiya ki prashasan kumaar kii madad isliye nahin kar rahaa he, kyonki rajya main thakuron kii sarkaar he
 The Chief Minister is also a Thakur, so there is pressure on the administration
 yogi ke satta main aane ke baad se hi thakur or zyada aakraamak ho gaye hai
 Sheetal and Sanjay's wedding was fixed in October
 iske turant baad hi sheethal ke parivaar waalon ne (joki paramparaagat rup se kisaan hai) gaanv ke bujurgon se shahi baraat ko lekar baat kii, ye baraat thakuron ke gharon se lage raaston se guzarane vaali thi
 The family knew that there could be opposition
 'daliton ke ghar ke saamne se baraat nikaalte hai thakur'aam taur par jatvon kii shaadi main aane vaali baraat nizamabad gaanv ke baahar janamasa main thaharti hai, or yahaan se baraat dulhan ke ghar jaati he
 And during this time, it does not cast a shadow on the Thakurs' area
 lekin kumaar or sheethal ke bade bhai bitu chaahate hai ki baraat gaanv kaa chakkar lagaae
 Sheetal's father Satyapal Singh says, "our elders never got a chance to ride a horse
" thakur chaahate hai ki ham isi se chipke rahen
 They say that if we take out the procession, they will be ashamed
 ve ise parampara bataate hai
 We say show proof of tradition
 'sheethal ke chachaa hari singh kehete hai, 'thakur apni baraat hamaare ilaake se nikaalte hai, ve hamaare ghar ke thik saamne se baraat nikaalte hai, shor machaate hai or hamane kabhi koi aapatti nahin kii
 'sheetal Satyapal has read till 6th, says that his family gave him and his brother' Singh 'surname, so that they could break the bonds of caste
 satyapal ke pita ne thakuron ke gharon main kaam karne se inkaar kar diya
 This was a revolutionary step to break the tradition, due to which the Jatavs were alive at the mercy of Thakurs
 satyapal or hari ne sarkari skool main padhai kii or aarakshan ke jariye unke parivaar main ab kai log sarkari naukariyon main hai
 Sheetal also went to school, but left school after 6th grade
 25 saal kaa science graduate sheethal kaa bhai bitu kahata he ki baraat ek barier ab bhi he or ise khatm hona chahie
 We have money and we are not harming anyone
 samvidhan hamen adhikaar detaa he, utana hi jitna ki anya ko detaa he
 'actually they are zamindars and now even the jobbers', in response to the Thakurs regarding the rise of Dalits, is clearly seen
 pradhan kanti devi kaa betaa aashu pundhir jatvon ko choti jati kaa maanane se inkaar karata he
 Pondir says, 'actually they are zamindars and now also jobbers
 police, railway or privet companiyon main kaam kar rahe hai
 Reading Poonir, mocking Kumar's statement in a newspaper, he says, "he wants to have a historic wedding, a wedding that has never been seen and heard before
" uskaa daawa he ki 5 hajaar log aaenge
 Then he should call the Chief Minister
 'sheethal kaa kahana he ki unhone kuch dalit activiston or adhikaar samoohon se madad maangi he
 Sheetal, present in the shadows of the family kitchen, says very clearly, 'if we were afraid, we would not have set a fight

 ali jafar 2010 se bollywood main active hai or unka har saal ek hit film dene kaa funda rahaa he
 Such as Tere Bin Laden (2010), Mere Brother Ki Dulhan (2012), Chashmebaddur (2013)
 unki agali film total sayapa bhi kamedi he or yah 7 march ko relies ho rahi he
 Excerpts from the conversation he had with the film and his singing: Your next film is Total Sayapa, your role in it? i am playing the character of a Pakistani boy who lives in London and goes to meet his girlfriend's parents
 jaise hi meri hakeekat unhen pataa chalati he, to sayapa shuru ho jaataa he
 You also played a Pakistani journalist in Tere Bin Laden? Yes, of course
 vah film hit rahi thi
 It is easy for me to play this character and it is also lucky
 yamini kii yah duusari hindi film he, unke saath aapaki tuning kisi rahi?ve behtareen adaakara hai
 Enjoyed working with her, she keeps working with her business anyway, and is very light hearted
 total sayapa kamedi film he
 Did it have fun during the shoot? It was really fun
 kiran kher to jabardast hai
 We used to have a lot of jokes
 kai baar to shooting ke dauraan hi ham hans padate the or hamen seen dobaaraa karnaa padataa tha
 Any special thing related to Total Sayapa? There are many stories on the set
 lekin film main meraa mujic he, yah khaas baat aapako milegi
 i have also sung songs
 aap saal main ek-aadh film hi karte hai, aisa kyon?main khud ko thakaane main yakeen nahin rakhata
 i only do selective work
 saath hi, parivaar ke saath bhi samay gujaarna meri priarity rahati he
 Do you have a hit every year? main bas kaam karata hum
 But i have two films coming out this year
 total sayapa or kil dil
 Is there a reason for it to be your musician too? Maybe, because i find it fun to make music by staying in my studio
 hameshaa kuch nayaa or acha banane kii koshish main laga rahata hum
 You are a lot more popular among girls, have you ever had any strange demand by a fan? i always try to keep my fans happy
 lekin kai maukey aise aa jate hai
 But the fans also understand the matter
 ab jaise meri ek femail fain ne mujhe kis karne ke liye kaha, maine manaa kar diya
 Of course, she also understood
 desh ke kai bade sarkari institute main haal main hui badi bhartiyon vivaad kaa hissaa bani hai
 IIMC director is also to be elected in the coming time
 media ke badalte maahaul or nai takneekon ke kaaran students kii maang he ki koi aisa diarector aae jo students or patrakarita kii maujuuda maangon ko puraa kar sake
 In this connection, we spoke to Ram Bahadur Rai, a journalist and writer with long experience in the field of journalism
 IIMC main aap kaisaa diarector chaahate hai?ek swytt sanstha kii taur par yah yah santhaan kaam kar rahaa he
 There is a view in the government that the government should run the way it wants to run and Narendra Modi's government is no exception
 yah shuru se hi chalaa aa rahaa he
 Prasar Bharati was formed in 1990-91 but till date it is unable to function like an autonomous institution
 main to kahuunga ki ek tarah prasar bharti kaa janm hi nahin hua
 Prasar Bharati is run by a government officer
 iimcmem koi bhi diarector general (DG) aae, usase students kii bhalaai honi chahie
 His presence should not be mere consumption
 yah bhi padhein :IIMC ke nae diarector ke bare main kya kehete hai pro
 The way CP Singhsarkar is being accused that he is making recruitments of his people in the Institute
 FTII ke students abhi bhi chairman ko hataane ke liye hadtaal par hai
 Will the government do politics in DG recruitment too? See, the government will learn something from the example of FTII
 chayan cameti ke do logon, swapan das gupta or rajat sharma se mujhe badi ummid he
 Rajat is running a media institute and Swapan Das Gupta has been a good journalist
 apni mehnat kii badaulat institute khadaa karne vaale logon main rajat bhi shaamil hai
 Because of this i think these people will definitely make better decisions
 kul 36 naam gaye hai, unamem se 12 shortlist hue hai
 Journalism experience will be made the mainstay in selection
 IIMC main padhai karne vaale zyaadaatar students chaahate hai ki unka campus placement ho jaae? kya aane vaale diji students kii is maang ko puraa kar paaenge?bharat sarkaar ke adheen jitne bhi media house hai, unamem yahaan ke students ko variyata milani chahie kyonki sarkari media houseej main achche kaam karne vaale logon kii sakht jarurat he
 Hence it was made a rule that IIMC students get jobs in government media houses
 aisa karne se market main utane hi patrkaar paidaa honge, jitne hone chahie or aise institute bhi band honge jo patrakarita sikhaane ke naam par bas aise hi baithe hai
 Somebody is not going to the Institute of Journalism because he has to do citizen journalism ie Citizen Journalism
 aaj kal patrakarita ke students ke role model tivi ankar hai
 Placement is needed only by the students, and it should also be completed
 prasar bharti kaa apana ek recruitment board hona chahie kyonki yahaan zyaadaatar log diputesan par hai
 If recruitment board is formed then all the people will go back to their department and people working in the field of journalism will get a chance
 IIMC nikat bhavishya main uniwarsity banane ja rahaa he
 Do you think it will emerge as a good university? First of all, it has been announced to be a university
 isko lekar aage kya hota he, use tab dekha jayega
 Overall, the level of journalism studies has drastically declined
 yah institute ek udhaaharan ban saktaa tha ki is tarah padhai honi chahie
 If Arun Jaitley is talking about the university, then it is possible that educational reform is going on in his mind
 vah dhire-dhire ise lagu karenge
 But right now i do not think that IIMC would be able to become an autonomous institution of journalism instead of a government institution
 sansthaaen ek avadharana se banati he
 The formation of an institution is a process, we have withdrawn from that process for many reasons
 isliye centre se jude hue vishvavidhyalay hon, rajyon se jude ayog hon
 He has become a den of people who do not know anything about it
 yahaan ke students se phir bhi ummid rahati he kyonki yahaan daakhila lene ke liye likhit pariksha hoti he
 Ranbir Kapoor may be the heartbeat of millions in Bollywood, but perhaps he is nothing to Academy Award winner Hollywood actress Natalie Portman
 haal hi main CNN News18 ke saath hue intervyuu main ranbir ne kaha ki meraa dil tut gaya tha jab natali ne mujhe get loust kah diya tha
 Ranbir told Rajiv Masand, 'I ran behind Natalie during the Triveka Film Festival
 wo phone par baat kar raheen thim or ro raheen thim
 i went after them and said, i love you
 
 
 mere work bolne se pehle hi unhone mujhe 'get loust' kah diya
 This broke my heart
 'ranbir ne 'kil bill' or 'bastard' ke diarector quentin tarantino se milane kaa apana anubhav bhi intervyuu main share kiya
 Ranbir said, 'recently we were shooting for' Ae Dil Hai Mushkil 'in London
 main basament main shooting kar rahaa tha or quentin building main 'the Hateful Eight' ke pramotion main biji thea
 i heard that they are doing interviews
 mainekaranse kaha ki main upar ja rahaa hum
 i will not tell him that i am a Bollywood actor
 main unase bas milanaa chahta tha, unke saath photo lenaa chahta tha
 'but did his wish come true? is par ranbir kehete hai, 'main unhen dur se dekh kar hiquantin-quentincillane laga
 They saw me and walked in the car
 ' ise dekhakar film kii puri team hansane lagi
 Significantly, Ranbir's film 'A Dil Hai Mushkil' will be released on October 28 this year
 film main unke saath aishwarya raay bachchan, anoushka sharma or fawaad khan bhi lead role main hai

 noida-greater noida main shanivaar or ravivaar ke din dilli-ensiaar main ek drishy ko dekha janaa aam ho gaya he
 At the same time, the buyers flock to the builders' offices and make noise and return in the evening
 saptahanth kii unki chuttee pradarshan, dharne or narebaaji main bitati he
 Paying EMI for eight-ten years, it has become a part of the life of these people while looking for the house
 unke sangharsh kii badaulat real estate act bana or lagu bhi ho gaya
 But due to the poor attitude of the states, the buyers of this house could not get the benefit
 abhi isamen or vakt lag saktaa he
 In fact, the Central Law Real Estate (regulation and Development) Act 2016 i
e
 RERA came into force from May 1 to protect the people from the promise of powerful builder lobby
 par aadhe se zyada rajyon main act ke niyam notiphoi tak nahin hue hai
 Except Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, no state has a real estate regulatory authority
 iske bane bagaiyr iskaa khaas phayda nahin milane vaala
 This law is meaningless as long as there is no platform for complaining buyers
 kendriya awaas or shahari garibi unmoolan mantri venkaiya naidu kehete hai ki sabhi adhure project ko teen maheene ke bheetar registration karaane ke liye kaha gaya he kyonki kharidaaron kii dikkatein zyaadaatar aadhe bane project se judi hui hai
 The Ministry is monitoring regularly 
 act ko prabhavi dhang se lagu karne ke liye rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon or prashaskon ko kai patr likhe ja chuke hai
 State governments are also feeling the pressure of the public
 halaat jald badal jaaenge
 There is a lot of confusion in NCR but there is a lot of confusion over RERA in the National Capital Region (NCR), the country's largest real estate market in terms of numbers
 upi ne rule notiphoi kiye hai lekin athurity nahin banaai he or haryana ke draft rules jari hue hai
 Due to this, the condition of buyers suffering in Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and Faridabad remains the same
 32,000 sadasyon vaale noida ekstansion flats oner welfare association ke adhyaksh abhishek kumaar kehete hai ki noida-greater noida main hi kareeb 4
 5 lakh buyers are stranded
 association ne uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath se maang kii he ki puraani akhilesh sarkaar ke samay main adhishuchet kamjor real estate niyamon ko badla jaae or centre kaa kanoon jas kaa tas lagu kiya jaae
 The previous government of Uttar Pradesh had excluded the under construction project from its purview
 is masale par unhone mukhyamantri se puraani sarkaar ke lachar niyamon ko badalane kii maang kii he
 The Chief Minister has assured that the law will not be allowed to be relaxed
 vahiin noida-greater noida ke siio amit mohan kehete hai ki audyogic vikaas vibhaag ke nirdeshon ke mutabik, nae praavdhaanon par amal hoga
 However, authority has not been formed in UP
 sawaal yah bhi he ki athurity lakhanu main banegi yaa noida main? dhyaan rahe ki sabase zyada flats or kharidaar noida main hai
 Only clean people will stay in the market - Amit Modi but builders' institution is not at all suspicious about the CREDAI Real Estate Act
 cridai ke upaadhyaksh amit modi kehete hai ki ek niyam kaa paalan karnaa he
 The government has brought this law
 taaki aam aadmi ko vakt par makaan mili or builder niyamon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karen
 Clean builders will be in demand
 market kii jitani gandagi he, teen saal main saaf ho jaaegi or raturaat project launch kar paisa batorne vaale builder baahar ho jaaenge
 RERA rules in Uttar Pradesh have completed 65 per cent registration and the projects assigned to RWA do not need to be registered under the Act and under construction projects will have to be registered
 builder daregaa kyonki isamen sajaa kaa praavdhaan he
 Puneet Parashar of Amrapali Heartbeat, who spearheaded a buyers' movement in Noida, says RERA is good for new buyers but those who have booked a house ten years ago do not see any benefit from the movement and demand that RERA built
 2010 ke aasapaas launch hue gadabadi karne vaale project iske daayre main aaenge, to bhi sakht sajaa na hone ke kaaran 10 fisadi penalty dekar batch jaaegein
 This is the flexibility of the law
 dilli-ensiaar or noida main 2007-08 or uske baad launch hue project main abhi tak delivery nahin mili he
 Similar to UP, Maharashtra is also the largest real estate market in terms of prices in the country, where rules are relaxed
 plan main sanshodhan ke liye do-tihaai khariddaaron kii sahmati ko hataakar aakhri plan ko hi maanane kaa praavdhaan kiya he jo ki bilderon ke liye mufeed kaha ja rahaa he
 The responsibility of government departments is not fixed
builder says that the Act has only one negative point which does not include governmental organizations, nor has any responsibility been fixed for them
 vahiin sarkaar kisaanon se jameen leti he or tender ke madhyam se builder use kharidta he
 Despite this, it takes two years for the builder to take more than two dozen clearances after taking the land for a project
 isse laagat bad jaati he
 Ghaziabad lawyer Ramanand Goel says that the builders are robbed in the name of super area
 karpet aria bataane kii anivaaryta hogi to builder rate badha degaa
 The government says 20 percent, but the builders cut the carpet area by 40 percent
 yah kanoon bade bilderon ko phayda pahunchane ke liye laayaa gaya he
 Great Consumer Forum from RERA - D
 ke
 Gargavi Supreme Court lawyer D
 ke
 Garg says that this is the law of the future
 maujuuda builder peediton ko isse koi phayda nahin he
 RERA is a more powerful consumer forum than authority which has the right from penalty to jail
 niyam notification jari hone ke saath infrastracchar banaae bagaiyr RERA kaa deshbhar main lagu hona mushkil he
 Given the current situation, it may take about a year to execute
 chunaav vaale rajyon main zyada samay lag saktaa he
 Binafer Jehani, director of Crisil Research, says that the impact of RERA on the new launch will be seen immediately
 kanjumar ko confidence milegaa or kanoon ke puri tarah se lagu hone par paardarshita aegi
 People will get confidence to meet the house on time
 bazaar se anischitata khatm hogi jiskaa sakaaratmak asar dikhegaa
 However, RERA will be called a success only when buyers get justice, get houses and they get the benefit

 vishwa viraasat tajmahal main bandaron ke aatank se paryatak pareshaan hai
 The entire Agra administration has become helpless in dealing with their terror
 bandaron ke hamale se log lagaataar ghayal ho rahe hai
 Even the district administration of Agra has spent 1 crore 86 lakh rupees on their sterilization but the situation remains the same
 bandaron ko pakadaney ke liye pinjre bhi lagaae gaye lekin uskaa bhi koi phayda hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 Former Divisional Commissioner of Agra
 ram mohan raav ke aadesh par vanyajeev esoes enjio ne bandaron kii nasbandi kaa kaarykram chalaaya tha
 Only 500 monkeys were sterilized in this
 ek bandar kii surgery kii keemat thi 37 hajaar rupye jo insaan kii surgery se bhi mahangi sabit hui
 The place where the monkeys were caught, they were not released at that location, but rather they were released at another place
 isse bhi bandar aakraamak ho gaye
 Wildlife SOS has now sent a revised plan to the administration which has said that 10 thousand monkeys are being sterilized
 isamen 3 karod rupye kharch hone kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he
 However, the Forest Department has not given NOC for this
 van vibhaag ne daawa kiya he ki unhone is enjio se kuch sawaal puche the jinke jawaab unhen abhi tak nahin mili hai
 Chief Forest Guard Javed Akhtar said that even after spending Rs 1 crore 86 lakh, the number of monkey attacks in Agra district has not reduced
 ye aankada darshata he ki bandaron kii sankhya nirantar bad rahi he or enjio ke prayaas bandaron ko control karne main naakaafi sabit ho rahe hai
 Now the forest department is waiting for this, ngos will be thought to capture the monkeys and report their operation, then give NOC
 enjio ne kaha, pinjre die hi nahin bandaron ko dur kaise chhodtehimachal pradesh main bhi vanyajeev esoes ne daawa kiya tha ki 2007 ke baad 1 lakh bandaron kii nasbandi kii gai he or har saal 20 hajaar bandaron kii vah surgery kar rahe hai lekin vahaan bhi bandaron kii sankhya control nahin ho pai he
 The NGO defended itself, claiming that after the sterilization of the monkeys, the Agra Municipal Corporation was to leave them in remote areas outside the city, but the cages that captured the monkeys were not given to the NGO, but they were kept in the municipal warehouse Has happened
 is vajah se samasya jas kii tas bani hui he

 sone kii keemton main pichley 15 dinon se jari giravat par jewelery demand ke chalate lagaam lagati dikh rahi he
 The purchase of gold by jewelers in the country is also increasing due to the rise in prices in the global market for the second consecutive day
 haalanki kanjumar ke liye jewelery bazaar abhi bhi jas kaa tas bana he
 Experts even believe that according to the global fall in gold prices, consumers will not get as much profit in buying jewelery as they are thinking
 somvaar ko sona 90 rupee or chaandi 150 rupee tejasone kii keemtonmen lagaataar duusare din teji dekhne ko mili
 In line with the strong global trend amid increased buying by jewelers, gold prices rose by Rs 90 to Rs 25,490 per 10 grams in Delhi's bullion market on Monday
 iske alawcamerica mudra ke muqablerupee kii vinimay dar girane se bhi sone kii keemton ko majbootee mili he

 1,104, up 5 percent
 66 dollar prati ounce tathaa chaandi kaa bhav 0
 14 with a 2 percent gain
 70 dollar prati ounce ho gaya he
 Preparing for an increase in making charges: Despite falling gold prices, buying jewelery will not be as beneficial
 dilli ke jewelery market main aam raay he ki pichley kuch dinon se keemton main jari giravat ne unke profit margin kam kar diya he
 Hence, he is reluctant to give a discount on the making charges associated with the price of jewelery
 dilli ke peepi jewalers ke rahul gupta ke mutabik sone main giravat yun hi jari rahi to jald unhen mekking chargees main bada ijapha karnaa padegaa
 How the jeweler's earnings decreased from gold to jewelery, if the jeweler's profit margin is 10%, then he earns Rs
 2900 per 10 grams of gold at a rate of Rs
 29,000 thousand
 yadi sone kaa rate girakar 27,000 ke str par rahe tojwailar kaa marginprati 10 gram kam hokar 2700 rupee ho jayega
 At the same time, this margin will be reduced to just Rs 2,500 at the current rate of 25,000
 is giravat ko dekhte hue rahul gupta samet zyaadaatar jewalers kaa maananaa he ki nae daron par sona kharidkar agar vah apana stock badha bhi le to jewelery banane main lebar or anya input cost main koi kami nahin hui he
 Hence, they have no other option but to increase the making charge to recover their margin
 aapaki jewelery main kitna hota he mekking chargem taur par jewelery kii keemat par 10 se 20 fisadi takmeking yaa lebar chargelia jaataa he
 However some big and branded jewelery showrooms also charge a making up to 40% in the name of designing and value addition and often offer a discount on this making charge to increase their sales
 iske alaava zyaadaatar jewalers holmarking ke naam par bhi kanjumar se atirikt paise vasuul lete hai

 According to a study, people who steal from physical work are comparatively more intelligent and intelligent
 aise main agar log ab tak kaamchori ke taane diya karte the to ab aap unhen bataa sakate hai ki budhimaan log fijical work kam karte hai
 Now you do not need to watch TV lying on the couch for long or make excuses for just lying there
 ab jab bhi koi apse kahe ki aap aalsee yaa kaamchor hai to fouran unhen bataaen ke aap aalsee isliye he kyonki aap budhimaan hai
 According to a research, people who are lazy or do less physically, actually have a sharp mind
 adhyayan ke anusaar, jo log zyada samay tak sochate hai ve physical work kam kar pate he
 According to a survey, people with sharp minds are not very active physically
 baavjood iske wo bor nahin hote hai kyonki ve har samay kuch na kuch sochate rahete hai
 Their thoughts and their thinking means a lot to them and they remain busy in them
 research main paaya gaya he ki shaareerik rup se zyada kaam karne vaale log "non-thinkar" hote hai or wo apane vichaaron par bhi dhyaan nahin dete
 According to this study published in the "journal of Health Psychology", both thinking and physical work are necessary for complete development
 haalanki shaareerik rup se zyada kaam karne vaale log jaldi bor ho jate hai jisase unke dimag par bhi bura asar padataa he
 One more thing to be noted in the study is that people who are more intelligent but steal work, they also get bored after a time and they also have negativity
 aise main agar sochane ke saath hi kaam karne kii aadat bhi develop kar lee jaae to lifestil ko or behatar banaaya ja saktaa he
 Famous singer and pop star Shakirajinke's dance and voice are convincing, do you know that Shakira was once called by someone to make a goat-like sound

 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne 14 june ko apane mantriyon se kaha tha ki ve janata ko jiesti ke phaayde samajhaayen, kyonki nai kar vyavastha ko lekar janata main bhram kii sthiti he
 The state GST bill was introduced in a special session called on May 15 of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 iske paarit hone ke baad sabhi vidhayakon ke liye kaaryshaala kii gai, jisamen unhen prastaavit kar vyavastha or isse jude kanoon ke bare main bataaya gaya
 Uttar Pradesh Minister Suresh Khanna says that the revenue of the state is likely to increase due to the implementation of the new tax system

 The Supreme Court in its judgment on March 17 had quashed the notification to include Jats in the OBC list of the central government
 court ne saaf taur se kaha tha ki jat saamaajik or shaikshanik rup se pichde nahin hai kyonki sashastr bal, sarkari naukariyon or shikshan sansthaanon main inaki sankhya kam hone kii baat galat he
 The Jats staged a sit-in protesting the court's decision
 iske baad 26 march ko jaaton kaa 70 sadasyeey pratinidhimandal pradhanmantri narendra modi se mila tha, jahaan punarvichaar yachika daakhil karne kaa bharosa diya gaya
 But the OBC has described this initiative of the government as a threat to its interests and has prepared a speech against the Modi government against Jat reservation
 kyon sulag rahi he aagmandal kamishan kii siforeeshon ke tahat desh kii 52 fisadi aabaadi vaale pichhadon ko 27 fisadi aarakshan mila hua he, lekin isamen jaaton ko shaamil kiye jane ko pichhadaa varg atikaraman maan rahaa he
 Whereas the Jat community does not want to leave it under any circumstances in view of the benefits gained due to reservation in the last one year
 obisi ne pichhadaa varg ko-ordination cameti banaakar sabhi sanghathanon ko lamaband kar sansad kaa bajet satr khatm hone se thik pehle 7 may ko dilli ke jantar mantar par ardhangn avasthaa main dharna-pradarshan kii ranneeti bana lee he
 Rajkumar Saini, BJP MP from Kurukshetra, Haryana, who is leading this OBC movement, says "jats are not educationally, socially, economically, politically, administratively backward
 kisi ayog ne unhen is shrenee main daalane kii sifarish nahin kii
 Yet, Jats are eager to enter the OBC 27 per cent reservation unconstitutionally
 hamane pradhanmantri se milane kaa samay maanga he
 "according to him, the representatives of the 75 Khapas who became the Messiah even said that who is the Supreme Court to stop the reservation? These people threatened that on May 11, the water of Delhi would be withheld and milk would be fought
 haalanki jat netaa or purv kendriya mantri ajit singh india today se kehete hai, "jat samudaay ko ek saal main aarakshan kaa kaaphi phayda mila or kai chaatro ko iity jaise sansthaanon main daakhila mila or naukari main bhi laabh mila he, isliye unamem aarakshan chhinane par gussahai
 "the entire Bharat Khap and Jat Reservation Conflict Committee has announced a warning rally at Jantar Mantar on 11 May
 ajit singh kaa maananaa he ki jat ab jaagruk ho gaye hai isliye apane adhikaar kii maang kar rahe hai
 But they justify the opposition of OBC saying that there is opposition from those coming from outside
 jabaki kendriya krishi rajyamantri sanjeev baalion kehete hai, "jaaton ko aarakshan to milegaa, lekin rasta kya hoga abhi yah tay karnaa he
 At present, the government has filed a review petition in the court
 aarakshan to pehle hi mil janaa chahie tha, lekin deree se mila or bahut jaldi chhin gaya
 "some Jat leaders say that if the decision of the court is not in the interest of the Jats, then the Jats settled around delhi-ncr may take steps like stopping the supply of milk and water
 kya he sarkaar-bijepi kii ranneeti?loksabhaa chunaav main jaaton se mili apaar samarthan se utsahit modi sarkaar ne supreme court main daakhil halafname main pichhali sarkaar ke faisle ko nyyochit tehraaya tha
 But the court has increased its problems by canceling the notification of the government
 jat pratinidhiyon se mulaakaat main pradhanmantri modi ne samvidhan ke daayre main aarakshan kaa bharosa diya tha to bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne is khetihaar jati ko aarakshan se baahar rakhane ko galat tehraaya tha
 Now the government has filed a review petition in this case stating that the recommendation of the National Backward Classes Commission is not mandatory in the decision of the government and based on long deliberations and documents, it is decided to include Jats in the list of obcs
 i went
 lekin sarkaar court ke faisle tak jat samudaay ko dhairya rakhane ko kahegi
 The bjp's major challenge is against opposition from the obcs
 kshetreey dalon se niraash obisi ke bade tabake ne loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko vot diya tha, jisaki naaraazgi party ke liye nuksandeh ho sakati he
 The difficulty of the party is that the OBC faction of the party is appearing in the protest, which does not care about disciplinary action
 agar court jaaton ke khilaaf faisla detaa he to sarkaar dohari mushkil main ghir sakati he
 The Jat leaders of other opposition parties have started to put the Modi government in the dock
 ajit singh kaa kahana he ki punarvichaar yachika main sarkaar ne thik se koi pairvi nahin kii he
 The question should have been raised that the reservation under the Mandal Commission in 1993 can be obtained on the 1934 survey, so why not the Jats on the facts and figures of 10 years old
 jat aarakshan ke faisle ke vakt upie sarkaar kii cabinet kaa hissaa rahe ajit singh kaa kahana he ki pichhadaa varg ayog ne jameen par jaakar survey nahin kiya
 They also question the Supreme Court
 ve kehete hai, "rajya kii naukariyon main jat aarakshan he, lekin centre main nahin
 Not so with any other caste
 " lekin is bare main saamudayik takaraav kii sthiti ko dekhte hue haryana bijepi ke adhyaksh subhash baraala behad sadhi hui tippanee karte hai
 He says, "BJP does not do caste politics
 kisi bhi birdari kaa koi garib ho, use aarakshan milanaa chahie or usee drushtikon se centre sarkaar ne yachika daakhil kii he
 "however, on the barricade of BJP MP Saini, he says that if someone talks about his class, then there is nothing wrong in that
 siforeeshon par baari siyasatsupreme court ne rashtriya pichhadaa varg ayog kii jat aarakshan ke khilaaf di gai sifarish ko sahi tehraate hue kaha he ki isamen koi shaq nahin ki ayog ne rajya pichhadaa varg aayogon kii report, uplabdh sahitya or bhartiya saamaajik vigyaan anusandhan parishad kii visheshgy cameti kii report ke aadhaar par sifarish kii thi
 But the Center used its power to dismiss it
 aisa karte vakt ayog kii sifarish ko khaarij karne kaa tarkpurna aadhaar hona chahie tha, jo nahin dikh rahaa
 According to the study conducted by the council, there was no survey in Bihar, whereas in Delhi, Jats are slightly behind socially, educationally, compared to ahir-gurjar
 gujarat main koi dastavej nahin he to himachal, madhya pradesh main tulanaatmak aankade nahin
 Statistics of backwardness exist in some areas in Rajasthan
 jabaki upi-uttarakhand kii naukariyon main jat aabaadi ke lihaaj se thik hai
 But Haryana has 87 per cent Jat farmers and the jobs share is 21 per cent, which is close to 25 per cent of its population
 jaahir he ki uplabdh tathyon or vot kii raajnneeti ne aarakshan kii aag ko sulagaa diya he, jisaki lapten salanaa jashn manaane ja rahi modi sarkaar ko jhulasa sakati hai
