 After that going to the stadium and watching cricket matches will be expensive
 match ke tikat 28 fisadi tak ke kar daayre main aaenge
 Especially on the ticket of IPL (indian Premier League) matches, it will be the biggest hit
 khel sanghathanon ke aayojan par pehle 28 fisadi tex kaa praavdhaan tha
 But in the meeting held on Thursday i
e
 June 29, it was decided to increase it to 18 percent
 lekin yahaan sarkaar ne ek shart rakh di
 The tax of 18 per cent will be levied only on tickets for those matches where the ticket price will be less than Rs 250
 chunki cricket ke takreeban sabhi muqablon main tikat 250 se zyada hoti he, khaskar ipel ke maichon main to tikaton kii keemat kaaphi zyada hoti he isliye unpar 28 fisadi kaa hi tex vasula jayega
 Similarly, 28% tax will be levied on expensive tickets for events like Hockey League, Kabaddi League, Wrestling League
 haalanki hockey, footbal va anya khel jinke tikat apekshaakrit saste hote hai or tikaton kii keemat 250 rupee se kam hoti he unpar mahaj 18 fisadi tex lagegaa
 That is, the audience will not have to suffer much loss here
 cricket match khaskar ipel ke dauraan maidan puri tarah se bhare hote hai
 Tickets for these matches are also expensive
 pichley kuch saalon main maidan par jaakar match dekhne waalon kii sankhya badi he
 In such a situation, the government felt that revenue can be earned from here
 duusari ore sarkaar aam khel prashansakon ko niraash bhi nahin karnaa chaahati isliye bich kaa rasta nikaala gaya or 250 rupee se kam keemat ke tikat par 18 fisadi to adhik par 28 fisadi kaa tex nirdhaarit kiya gaya

 Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Mittal, two of India's most aggressive and exciting entrepreneurs who faced the telecom sector for the first time ten years ago, are once again ready to battle in the field of 4G
 airtel ne may, 2012 main kolkata or bangaloru main bharat kii pehali 4ji seva kaa aarambh kiya
 Currently 4G service is only for broadband and wireless data
 isamen wais telephoni yani is par baatcheet kii anumati nahin he
 Data can be sent in 4G at almost four times as compared to 3G or at 2 times the speed from 2G to 16 times
 mukesh ambani kii reliance industries 2012 kii duusari chamahi main bharat bhar main apni 4ji sevaayen shuru kar sakati he
 Ambani Akwale is the operator who is licensed for 4G services in all 22 circles in India
 bharti airtel kii upasthiti aath pramukh cirkilon main he, jinamein dilli, mumbai, bangaloru or kolkata shaamil hai
 Many experts believe that 4G data is the future of the telecom industry itself
 swatantra doorsanchaar salaahkaar mahesh uppal kehete hai, ''bharat jaise desh main, jahaan kaaphi kam phixd line telephone hai, internet sevaaon ko keval wireles broadband ke madhyam se hi failaayaa ja saktaa he
 There is a demand in India for high-speed data services, especially video
 doorsanchaar kshetra ke purv udhyami or sansad sadsy rajeev chandrashekhar kehete hai, ''kavbal or satellite tivi kii pahunch bharat main mobile sampark kii tulana main bahut kam he
 4G is a suitable technology for this potential market
 ''bharat main 80 karod se adhik mobile graahak hai, lekin televijan kii pahunch keval 45 karod logon tak he
 4G services will not have problems like buffering and slow uploading of video files
 par anya visheshgy 4ji sevaaon se hone vaali aay kii sambhaavnaaon ke bare main zyada ashaavadi nahin hai
 Says independent telecom consultant Ravi Visvesvaraya Prasad, "85 percent of telecom companies' income in India comes from voice services
 inaki keval 15 fisadi aay data sevaaon se he, jisamen esemes bhi shaamil he
 "prasad believes that Ambani and Mittal have ventured into a 4G business where the risk is high because the sources of income are not very large
" lekin ve ambani kii mahatvakanksha ke bare main kehete hai ki ''nai pahal karne vaale ko hameshaa hi baaki logon ke mukaable badhat mil hi jaati he
 When the government auctioned 4G spectrum in June 2010, neither Ambani nor Mittal took it more seriously
 ambani ne is nilaamee ke turant baad himachal futuristicks ke pramotor mahendra nahata kii company infotel main 95 pratishat hissedari kharidkar 4ji ke kshetra main pravesh kiya
 Infotel was the only company to have a 4G license to provide services across India for Rs 13,000 crore
 se kuch kam main mila tha
 4,800 crore to buy Infotel's stake in Ambani
 kaa bhugtan kiya
 It is said that he also paid the license amount
 mittal kii airtel ne chaar cirkilon main spectrum paane ke liye lagbhag 3,500 karod ru
 Repay
 may, 2012 main airtel ne kwalkom kii 4ji sevaaon ke liye bani bhartiya ikai main 49 pratishat hissedari 1,000 karod ru
 Out of which it has spectrum in four attractive circles of Delhi, Mumbai, Haryana and Kavral
 isse yah sanket mila ki mittal 4ji main gambhirtha se utarane vaale hai
 The fight between Mittal and Mukesh Ambani took place over a brief period between December 2002 and June 2005
 disambar, 2002 main mukesh ambani ne reliance infocom kii shuruyaat kii, jo pita kii mrityu ke baad unka pehla udhyam tha
 a press release at the time said that Reliance Infocomm, led by Mukesh Ambani, "will usher in a digital revolution in India
" ''ambani sidime takanic kaa prayog kar is kshetra main utre, jisase mittal sahit saare jiesem oparator pareshaan ho gaye
 But Mukesh Ambani parted ways with the telecom sector in 2005 when he handed over his brother Anil Ambani to Reliance Infocomm as a part of business
 2ji or phir 3ji kii ladaai anil ke jimme chhod di gai
 The layers of digital revolution are still opening even after seven years
 or mukesh ambani ek baar phir qatari main sabase aage khadey hai
 It is possible that it will take time to become a large base of 4G services
 philhal, 4ji sevaayen dene ke liye uplabdh upkaran kaaphi kam hai
 Uppal says, "the ecosystem of 4G is divided based on different frequencies
 in upkarnon kii uplabdhta or keemat ab bhi ek chunauti he
 4G service is provided in 2,500 mhz band worldwide
 lekin bharat main is seva ke liye 2,300 megahertz kii frequency di gai he
 Therefore it will not be easy to mold imported equipment under Indian conditions
 chandrashekhar echosystem ke bare main zyada chintit nahin hai
 He says, "once 4G starts, the ecosystem will be built automatically
 '' bharti airtel ne jin sthanon par 4ji sevaayen shuru kar di hai, vahaan vah abhi hi uchit keemat vaale 4ji tablet de rahi he
 Uppal expects a strong relationship between hardware manufacturers and 4G services companies
 4ji sevaayen tablet, dongal, (laptop main lagaaya jane vaala upkaran) or computer ke madhyam se di ja sakati hai
 In 2002, Reliance Infocomm sold CDMA handsets cheaply to attract consumers towards its services
 lagbhag nishchit he ki mukesh ambani apni 4ji sevaaon ko badhaava dene ke liye kuch usee tarah kii ranneeti par chalenge
 There are also reports that Reliance can manufacture the equipment itself
 isane 4ji upkarnon ke liye arikson ke saath bhi talmail kiya he
 The same operator will win the battle of 4G, which will be able to provide the cheapest ecosystem for it
 yah ladaai 4ji seva dene vaali company kii ore se uplabdh samagriyon (content) par bhi nirbhar hogi
 Mukesh Ambani added 1,700 crore to Raghav Bahl's TV18 and Network18
 kaa jo nivesh kiya, vah content uplabdh karaane ke kshetra main apni paith banane kaa ek sachet kadam tha
 The recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) have also brought a new twist in the field of 4G
 ye siforishein iske purv adhyaksh je
 s
 sarama ke 13 may ko pad chhodane se thik pehle april main rakhi gayi
 TRAI has suggested that the use of spectrum be liberalized, so that 4G can also be used for voice telephony
 sarkaar ne abhi yah sifarish sweekaar nahin kii he
 This is controversial because 4G spectrum was sold much cheaper than 3G due to the fact that 4G was not allowed to be used for voice telephony
 aalochakon kaa tark he ki is tarah spectrum kaa udaarikaran doorsanchaar kshetra main pichley daravaaje se nae khilaadiyon ko pravesh detaa he
 If these recommendations are accepted, then Mukesh Ambani will be able to compete with Mittal in providing voice telephony
 mittal or mukesh ambani donon ke liye jaruri he ki unki 4ji seva safal ho
 Mittal's profits are under pressure due to fierce competition in voice telephony
 tathy yah he ki agar spectrum kii rifarming par tri kii siforishein maan lee gayi to unhen 40,000 karod ru
 Will have to be paid
 ambani ke tel gas kaarobaar par petroleum mantralay se abhootpurv dabaav he
 However, Ambani can still prove to be financially strong
 reliance industries 1 lakh karod ru
 Is sitting on a huge stock of cash
 lekin kathin paristhitiyon ke baavjood laabh kama rahe mittal jabardast pratispardhaa karenge
 This will give consumers the benefit of cheaper, faster and better quality services

 Fans raged on Cheteshwar Pujara, saying - Our role model was no longer on the backfoot till the first day, but after turning the lower-order batsmen and Pujara's precious wickets cheaply, he turned the dice towards him

 Did MCD use the fees charged by the traders to salvage the market? We have asked these questions to the MCD
 brajesh ne kaha, kyonki agar ham shulk de rahe hai to ye hamaara jaanane kaa haq he ki hamaara diya hua paisa kitna jamaa hua or kya hamaare liye us paise kaa istemaal hua
 At the same time, first of all, MCD will say that before sealing, they should give notice to the traders that there will be sealing here
 ye tarika galat he ki sidhe gaye or dukaan sil kar di
 If the traders do not listen, they will perform on the road
 ab ye dekhnaa hoga ki emsidi is maamle ko kis tarah sulajhaati he
 Because if traders come on the road, then the condition of Delhi can worsen

 Brijpal survived this attack but 5 people died in this bloody game

 sunita upi police main consteble thi
 Sunita was later dismissed for her involvement in criminal activities
 baad main vah hycourt gai or use dubaara police kii naukari mil gai

 Also asked related questions
 sawaal:puraane bade noton kii bandi kaa koi virodh nahin kar saktaa, iskaa sirf swaagat ho saktaa he
 i believe that 95 percent of the people in our country are honest, only 5 percent and even less people make black money
 aapako pataa he ki bharat gramin or nakad par aadhaarit samaaj he
 To change their own money, people standing in long lines are suffering a lot, what will be the benefit of this decision of the government? Answer: i believe that the number of unscrupulous people in the country is very low, so it would be wrong to call India a country of unscrupulous people
 ye kuch gine chune log hi anya 95 fisadi eemaandaar logon par baari pad rahe hai
 They are eating their hard earned money
 hamen isse nipatane kii jarurat he or yah notebandi ise hi dhyaan main rakhte hue kiya gaya he
 If you want to let them continue in the process of raising money and want to see 95 per cent of the people in trouble, then you are being dishonest with the country and we do not want to do this while in government, at least Modi government No
 modi sarkaar kaledhan par jiro tolerance rakhti he
 In the long run, it will be an advantage that the legal money that goes out of this country will remain in the country
 byaaj daron main kami aegi, bainkon main zyada paise honge or pehle se ghoshit nitiyon ko badhaava milegaa
 Overall, this will strengthen the economy and today only those in line will be empowered
 bainkon main jamaa hue paison se janata ke hiton main kaam laayaa ja sakegaa
 Question: Black money earners were looting government money
 ab sarkaar ko zyada paise milenge
 Is this linked to the Modi government's model of 'minimum Government Maximum Governance'? Answer: No, i do not agree with this
 adhiktam shashan sarkarein hi tay karti hai
 The government has to ensure that when it is separating itself from the government, it is allowing you to operate on its own
 yah ek prajatantric desh he or vartmaan sarkaar eemaandaar he
 This money belongs to the state exchequer and its utility is for the people of the country
 isse desh ke logon ko hi phayda pahonchega

 samaajawaadee party main jari ghamaasan ke bich maan-manouvval kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 After meeting CM Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow, party general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav said on Thursday that the chief minister does not tolerate external interference
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki kuch log netaji yani mulaayam singh yadav ke saral swabhaav kaa phayda uthaate hai
 Earlier on Wednesday, Akhilesh Yadav said that a person outside the family is responsible for the current crisis
 akhilesh ne haalanki kisi kaa naam to nahin liya lekin samajha ja rahaa he ki yah nishaanaa saansad amar singh par tha
 The infighting in Amar's party began in Rayatmulayam's clan after the removal of two ministers of the Akhilesh government and then the chief secretary
 is ghatana kii prishthbhumi main haal main kuch aisi baaten huin jo is puure prakaran ke liye amar singh ko jimmedaar tehraati hai
 Actually, the script of this reshuffle was written at a party of Amar Singh on Sunday night
 nai dilli ke ek five star hotel main yojit is party main mulaayam singh ke alaava shivpal singh or mukhya sachiv deepak singhl bhi shariq hue the
 Akhilesh was also invited for this party but he did not come
 amar singh kii khub sunate hai netajibataya ja rahaa he ki is party ke dauraan amar singh ne deepak singhl kii maujuudagi main mulaayam singh ko bataaya ki upi ke khanan mantri gayatri prajapati sibiai ke radar par hai
 If they are arrested, then the Samajwadi Party, the state government and the Mulayam family can cause trouble
 agle din mulaayam ne amar singh or deepak singhl ko dilli sthit apane awaas par bulaayaa
 On Mulayam's asking, both of them repeated the night
 is par mulaayam singh ne akhilesh ko gayatri prajapati ke saath saath raaj kishor singh kaa bhi vibhaag badalane ko kah diya
 Akhilesh made a reshuffle at Netaji's behest
 On Tuesday, Gayatri Prajapati met Netaji and tried to convince him that Amar Singh and Deepak Singhal's claim was baseless
 prajapati mulaayam singh ko apni begunaahi ke bare main aashwast karne main kaamyaab rahe
 After this Mulayam Singh asked to remove Deepak Singhal from the post of Chief Secretary
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki akhilesh singhl se pehle se hi naaraaz chal rahe the, isliye unhone singhl ko tatkaal mukhya sachiv ke pad se hataa diya or apane pasandida afasar rahul bhatnagar ko rajya kaa nayaa mukhya sachiv bana diya
 Akhilesh did not listen Netaji was surprised to be removed from the post of Chief Secretary Singhal reached Mulayam Singh
 unhone kaha ki mantriyon ke bare main unki koi raay nahin thi or wo keval amar singh ko sun rahe the
 Amar Singh also appealed to Netaji to reinstate Singhal
 is par mulaayam ne akhilesh se kaha ki wo donon mantriyon or deepak singhl ko phir se behaal karen
 But Akhilesh did not listen to his father this time
 unhone mulaayam ko samajhaayaa ki chunavi mausam main unke is kadam se galat sandesh jayega
 As soon as he got the chance, Shradha Nishamulayam entrusted the responsibility of persuading Akhilesh to Ram Gopal but did not bother with CM Tuss
 isse naaraaz mulaayam ne akhilesh se pradesh adhyaksh kaa pad chhinakar shivpal ko saunp diya
 The CM retaliated and snatched all important portfolios from Shivpal
 is tarah upi ke siyasat main beete 72 ghante se mache ghamaasan ke peeche amar singh kaa haath bataaya ja rahaa he
 However, Amar Singh is denying that Akhilesh had pointed to him as an 'outsider'
 amar kii vaapasi ke khilaaf the akhileshvaise bhi akhilesh samaajawaadee party meqamar singhki vaapasi ko lekar khush nahin the
 Amar Singh, who is called the magician of politics, has returned to the SP, his work was not being done
 apni image ko lekar sanjeeda akhilesh ne amar singh ko kabhi haaavee nahin hone diya
 Its pain was sometimes seen as a threat to resign from the Rajya Sabha post and sometimes as a warning to leave the party
 vaise to amar singh mulaayam singh yadav ke kaaphi kareebi rahe hai lekin shivpal se kareebi kii vajah se chah saal baad party main unki vaapasi kaa rasta saaf hua tha or rajyasabha bhi bheje gaye
 Ramgopal, like Akhilesh, was also against Amar Singh's return
 isliye is maamle main guruuvar ko pehali baar media ke saamne aae ramgopal ke nishane par amar singh hi rahe
 Amar broke many houses! The negative about Amar Singh is that he specializes in infighting in a clan
 amitabh bachchan se lekar ambani parivaar iskaa udhaaharan he
 Amar Singh took advantage of his close association with Shivpal to increase his supremacy and was behind the scenes to vent his dissatisfaction
 shivpalka asantosh kareeb saadhe chaar saal purana he jab vidhansabha chunaav main sapa kii jeet ke baad netaji ne akhilesh ko siem bana diya tha
 At that time Shivpal wanted to become CM

 unhone modi sarkaar par sansad main vaada karne ke baavjood andhrapradesh ko vishesh darja dene se ‘‘inkaar'' karne ke aarope lagaae
 Naidu said that Modi, despite being the Chief Minister for 12 years, did nothing for his home state of Gujarat but assured everyone that he had done "big things"
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘‘ham sabane is par vishwaas kiya
 The whole country believed, but they were cheated

 Chief of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Rajya Sabha member Ram Vilas Paswan termed Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's attitude in the 'narendra Modi case' as a plight and said that if Chief Minister Kumar is truly friendly to the minorities then he will be with the BJP in a new situation Explain your relationship immediately
 paswan ne kaha, ‘bhaajapa ke pravaktaa balbir punj ne ek baar phir narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad ke kaabil bataa kar nitish kii party ko chunauti di he
 Nitish Kumar, who has raised the issue of secular prime minister, is of a submissive attitude
 agar aisa nahin he to unhen bhaajapa ke saath apni party ke sambandh ko turant spasht karnaa chahie
 The former Union Minister said, "there is silence between BJP and Janata dal-u in tu-tu, main-me, about BJP making Modi the prime ministerial candidate
" isse lagata he ki ve bhi modi ke paksh main he
 In such a situation, the Bihar Chief Minister should tell what will be the relationship of his party with the NDA
 ’paswan ne bihar main apane teen din ke kaaryakramon ko radd kar diya he
 He said, 'I am among the main proponents proposing Pranab Mukherjee's candidacy for the post of President
 mujhe kal unki ummidavaari kaa prastaav pesh karnaa he isliye hamane bihar kaa apana kaarykram sthagit kar diya he
 He said that the melody that Nitish created about Modi seems to be 'helping to create air in Modi's favor in the Gujarat assembly elections as Modi's strategy is polarized on the religious grounds of the electorate
 ’ullekhneey he ki nitish kumaar ke us bayaan par bhaajapa or jad you ke bich tikhi bayaanbaji kaa silsilaa abhi thama nahin he ki ‘koi dharmanirpeksh netaa hi bharat kaa pradhanmantri ho saktaa he
 While making this comment, Nitish Kumar did not name the Chief Minister of Gujarat, but all the debate arising out of it focuses on Narendra Madi

 In the letter, Rajbhar has cited that if you and Ekta Manch come together in the electoral struggle of UP, then big political parties in UP can be dusted
 rajbhar kehete hai ki arvind kejariwal ne bijepi-congress-sapa-bispi jaisi partiyon ke khilaaf sangharsh main sahyog kii apil kii thi, jiske baad main unhen yah patr bheja tha
 But till now no response has come from their side

 Where the common man is compelled to eat expensive pulses, the mps should be called Mali helpers or government subsidies, which cost 13 rupees 11 paise, fried lentils get only 4 rupees

 There are only 12 government subsidized cylinders for a family in a year
 us par bhi loklubhaavan vigyaapan, pradhanmantri ke prerak udbodhan or sarkari imadad yanisebsidi chhodane kii guzarish
 Of course, this is the specialty of India that the people were so emotional and kind that in one stroke more than five and a half lakh people gave up gas subsidy and 102 on the government
 3 karod rupee kaa boj kam ho gaya
 Should the MP ever adopt a campaign to give up subsidy, there should also be a campaign to leave subsidy
 samay ke saath yah aprihaary he or desh ke vikaas ke liye jaruri bhi
 The only question is that when our biggest representative is not ashamed to eat 100 rupees for 25 rupees, which earns more than one and a half lakh rupees every month through wages and other allowances, then average income gas consumers, including There are also daily wage laborers and poor living in the slum, the appeal to leave subsidy does not seem to be irrational
 artiai se khulaase ke baad jab is par bahes chali to baat mananeeyon ke 'pet par laat maarane' jaisi baat tak ja pahunchi
 Jitendra Reddy, the chairman of the Parliament's food affairs committee, dismissed the possibility of removing the subsidy and said, 'my grandmother used to say that nobody should be kicked on the stomach
 'bahes kaa vishay banakar khatm ho jayega masalasasandiy kaary mantri venkaiya naidu ko ye acchhee bahes kaa vishay lagata he, lekin vah kehete hai ki faisla do-chaar logon ke bas kaa nahin he, maamla aayaa to vichaar bhi hoga
 Some mps also said in good faith that we are ready to give up the subsidy
 yahaan yah bhi gaur karnaa hoga ki isi saal 2 march ko pehali baar ek pradhanmantri ke taur par narendra modi ne sansad kii canteen main keval 29 rupee main bhojan kiya or visitor book main 'anndaata sukhi bhav' likhaa tha
 They may not have thought, otherwise the Parliament's better initiative to end the canteen subsidy could have started at the same time
 sansad kii canteenon ko varsh 2013-14 main 14 karod 9 lakh rupee, saal 2009-10 main 10
 46 and 12 in 2011-12
 52 karod rupee kii sabsidi di gai
 Apart from mps, about 4000 employees also account in these canteens, of which 85 to 90 per cent are income tax payers

 In the Monsoon Session of Parliament starting on 21 July, the plate of Honorable will definitely become a point of debate

 The question is whether it will be considered that a new and clear Lakshman Rekha should be created without any discrimination for the government subsidies and the public disclosure of all the dignities, institutions and its real entitlement and the burden on the exchequer is only needed

 Jyotiba Phule, a supporter of widow marriage, had passed in 21 years 7th grade - Jyotiba Phule started the marriage ceremony of a Brahmin-priest without defying Brahmanism and later got it recognized by the Mumbai High Court
 - unki patni savitri bai phule bhi ek samajasevika thim
 She is called India's first female teacher and the first leader of the women's liberation movement
 - apni patni ke saath mil kar unhone ladakiyon kii shiksha ke liye saal 1848 main ek skool bhi kholaa tha

 petrol or dijal kii keemton se philhal raahat milti nahin dikh rahi he
 This increase continues due to the continuous rise in the prices of crude oil internationally
 somvaar ko mumbai main ek litrpetrol80
 10 has reached Rs
 vahiin, dijal ke liye bhi yahaan logon ko 67
 Have to pay 10 rupees
 is bich sarkaar ne kaha he ki vah lagaataar petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laane kii koshish main juty hui he
 Petrol prices on Monday once again reached the level before the excise duty was reduced
 dijal kaa bhi yahi haal he
 72 on a liter petrol in Delhi on Monday
 23 paise ho gai he
 Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said that the government is constantly trying to bring petrol-diesel and kerosene under the purview of GST
 iske liye prayaas kiye ja rahe hai;
 He hoped that the GST Council can take a decision on this soon
 petrol or dijal kii lagaataar badhati keemton ko lekar unhene kaha ki antarrashtriya str par lagaataar kachche tel kii keemten bad rahi hai
 On the other hand, due to the VAT levied by the states, prices are also increasing continuously
 agar petrol or dijal kojisti ke daayremen laayaa jaataa he, to isse in donon kii keemten 50 rupee ke tahat aa sakati hai
 This will relieve the common man from the excise duty levied at the central level and VAT levied by the states
 jiesti ke tahat is par parishad zyada se zyada 28 fisadi jiesti laga sakati he
 Along with this, it is also possible that the government should put some extra cess with it
 haalanki philhal isko lekar koi sahmati nahin bani he
 Even if the common man is in the way, but the states may have to suffer a big loss in revenue
 yahi vajah he ki sabhi rajya iske liye apni sahmati dene main samay laga rahe hai
 In such a situation, if petrol and diesel will be brought in GST, then there will be a big cut in their earnings, which the central government will have to arrange elsewhere
 haalanki, narendra taneja kehete hai ki agar petrol or dijal jiesti ke antargat aaenge to aam janata ko prati litre 10 se 15 rupee kii raahat mil sakati he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said after the meeting of the GST Council that even though not all states are currently ready for this, the Congress is ready to bring petrol and diesel under GST
 isse raah thodi aasaan ho jaaegi
 He hoped that a decision could be taken in the next meeting of the council

 In such a situation, suffocation increases even more
 agar aap bhi apni jindagi main sex se judi samasyaayein phase kar rahe hai or ye samaj nahin paa rahe ki is sthiti main kya kiya jaae to ghar main hing laaen
 Yes, a pinch of asafoetida can not only cure stomach ache, but it has been observed that it can also relieve sex related problems

 But a recent study has revealed that sex is one of the reasons for relationship breakdown

 The days of the Grand Alliance government are over and Nitish has once again formed a government in the state with the BJP
 buudhvaar shaam nitish kumaar ne rajyapal ko apana istipha saunpa or iske baad unhone patrakaron se baat karte hue jo baaten kahin wo isaki taraf ishaara kar rahi thim ki rajya ke up mukhyamantri or lalu yadav ke chote bete tejasvi yadav par lage bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii vajah se unke liye kaam karnaa mushkil ho gaya tha
 In a conversation with reporters, Nitish Kumar said that he is taking this step on the voice of his soul
 aaj se chaar saal pehle jab nitish bijepi se alag hue the tab bhi unhone kuch-kuch aisa hi kaha tha
 Then he said that we did not cheat
 ham to desh ko jodne kii raajnneeti karte hai
 They have cheated
 aise main saath kaam karnaa mushkil ho gaya tha
 Now let's go back a little further
 baat 1990 kii he
 Nitish Kumar had an important role in forming the government
 sarkaar banane ke baad lalu-nitish ke naam se jindabad ke naare saath-saath lagate the, lekin 1992 aate-aate sthitiyaan badalane lageen
 In December 1992, Nitish Kumar wrote a letter to the then Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav
 is chitthee ne bihar main ek nai raajnneetik party, samta party ke banane kaa rasta saaf kar diya tha
 The book written by senior journalist Shrikant of Bihar, Bihar: has appeared in the politics of letters and is once again readable today because the things that Nitish Kumar announced on Wednesday evening announced his separation from Lalu Nitish Kumar had written twenty five years ago in the letter
 tab nitish kumaar ne apni chitthee main jin baton kaa zikr kiya tha aaj bhi wo unheen baton ko doharaate hue dikhe
 In such a situation, the question arises that when twenty five years ago, Nitish was so hurt by Lalu, was hurt
 unhen bhrashtachar main duba bataa rahe the to 2013 main bijepi se alag hone ke baad lalu ke saath gaye hi kyon the?ham is patr ke kuch hisse aapako padhwaate hai
 Nitish writes

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has said that the resolve behind China's progress and development is worth learning
 saat din kii china yatra se patna laute nitish ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki unki yah yatra sarthak or upyogi rahi
 He said that during the visit, there was an opportunity to see and understand the progress of China and the work being done in China in various fields
 nitish ne kaha ki jis dhang se china ne pragati kii he, vah prashansa ke laayak he
 Whether it is a question of infrastructure or construction of roads, bridges or railways, industry, power sector or production in every field, their progress in all areas is worth seeing
 unhone bataaya ki china kii is yatra ke dauraan unhen gaanvon main bhi jane or unki krishi pranali bhi dekhne kaa mauka mila
 Nitish said that in the way they are arranging their agriculture, there are many such things which may not be possible for us to do in our country, but as far as their work is concerned, it is worth looking at
 unhone kaha ki har ek ilaake main milon tak aap chale jaaen, jis tarah se unhone nai takanic kaa sahaara lekar sabji kii kheti kii he ki puure ilaakon main milon tak ve green house dikhenge
 Nitish said that while visiting the area of shandong province, he found that the people there are producing 22 vegetables not only for themselves, not for the said province and country but also for other countries like Japan and South Korea
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki vahaan log company banaakar kheti karte hai par hamaare yahaan to kisaan apni jameen ke maalik swayan hote hai aise main ham unke model ko shaayad apana nahin paaen, lekin vahaan pragati dikhti he

 unhone kaha ki is yatra ke dauraan unhone dekha ki china main jo nirnay liye jate hai unpar amal jarur kiya jaataa he
 Nitish described China's roads as beautiful, wide and quality in terms of construction and said that they have been impressed by their progress and the way they work with a resolution is worth seeing
 unhone kaha ki china main bijli ke behtareen intjaam he or jarurat padane par ve apni kshamta kaa shat-pratishat ve utpaadan kar sakate hai
 Nitish said that there are a large number of people who believe in Buddhism and people believe that Buddhism is a philosophy of life
 unhone kaha ki yatra ke dauraan bihar ke bodhgaya or nalanda vishvavidhyalay kii charchaa hui or usamen logon ne dilchaspee dikhaai isliye isamen unhen aseem sambhaavna dikhti he
 Nitish said that in his view more and more people should go to China and see the development there and they would like a group of farmers and mlas from Bihar to go there and see for themselves what is happening there
 unhone kaha ki china kii tarah yahaan company banaakar krishi kaa vikaas nahin ho saktaa lekin ve kisaanon se dugdh utpaadan ke kshetra kii tarj par coparative banaakar apane utpaadon ko bazaar tak pahunchaakar behatar mulya paane ke prayaas karne ko kaha ja saktaa he
 Nitish said that this year has been declared by India and China together as 'year of Exchanges' and there will be a lot of exchanges under it, but going beyond that we would like people from our place to visit various places there and there learn from
 saat din ke china daure main nitish vahaan ke sandang praant, shanghai or beijing gayi or unhone mahasoos kiya ki unka sankalp seekhney or pragati dekhne laayak he

 unhone kaha ‘mujhako aisa lagata he ki hamaara jo rasta he vah tikaoo rasta he or aage ham badhenge, isamen koi shaq nahin’
 Describing his visit as worthwhile, Nitish said that the way people have shown interest in the field of electricity, tourism and solar energy, they feel that we will be able to move ahead in the coming days
 unhone bataaya ki asia ko buddha dharm kaise jodta he isko lekar kal vahaan ek antarrashtriya seminar yojit tha jisamen kai deshon ke vidwaan or rajanyik aae hue the

 Khurshid's response came when he was asked if the real power in India was with Sonia Gandhi rather than Manmohan Singh? When asked who in Sonia or Singh decides on whether a minister will remain in the cabinet or not, Khurshid said that the Congress President and Prime Minister decide on it together
 yah puche jane par ki kya pradhanmantri dwaara sonia ke saath milakar kisi cabinet mantri ke bare main faisla karnaa pradhanmantri ke visheshadhikaron kaa ulanghan nahin he, ‘khurshid ne bataaya, ‘nahin yah ulanghan nahin he

 lekin aap antim faisla tak pahunchane se pehle kisi vyakti ko sajaa nahin de sakate hai
 Asked whether the Prime Minister did not feel himself capable of seeking resignation from one of his five ministers allegedly facing corruption charges, Khurshid said that you cannot say the same about him
 If they realize that we have reached the level of taking any action, then they will not want to take action
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki yah kahana uchit nahin he ki pradhanmantri ek aise halaat kaa saamana kar rahe hai, jahaan unke paanch mantriyon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aarope hai
 Khurshid refused to accept that Sonia Gandhi was preventing Singh from taking action against any cabinet minister

 rajasthan sarkaar ek baar phir se gurjaron ko aarakshan dene ja rahi he
 This time Gujjars will be given reservation by categorizing in OBC
 iske liye obisi kaa kota badhaayaa jayega
 It is being told that an agreement has been reached between the group of ministers on behalf of the Rajasthan government and the Gurjar delegation under the guidance of Colonel Kirori Singh Bainsla, after which it was stamped at the Chief Minister's residence
 rajasthan sarkaar or gurjar netaaon ke bich hue samjhaute ke mutabik gurjar samet paanch jatiyon ko paanch fisadi aarakshan dene ke liye obisi cote ko 21 fisadi se badhaakar 26 fisadi kar di gai he
 a separate SBC (special Backward Class) reservation for giving five percent reservation to Gurjars in Rajasthan will be abolished through notifications
 is gurjar aarakshan ke liye pichley 10 saalon main teesri baar rajasthan sarkaar vidhansabha main vidheyak laane ja rahi he
 The government has indicated that the government will introduce a bill for this in the September monsoon session
 darasalgurjar andolanke baad bani chopra cameti ne 15 disambar 2007 ko gurjaron ko paanch fisadi aarakshan dene kii baat kahi thi uske baad rajasthan sarkaar ne vidhansabha main 2008 main vidheyak pesh kar gurjaron ko paanch fisadi or 15 fisadi aarakshan aarthik rup se agadon ko diya tha
 But at that time, the court had stayed it because there was no provision for financial reservation
 phir 30 july 2009 main sarkaar ne alag se gurjaron ko paanch fisadi aarakshan diya
 Then the total reservation in the state was 54 percent
 rajasthan hoicourt ne 50 fisadi se zyada aarakshan par roak di
 After that, on 6 May 2010, assuming the provision of 50 percent reservation, the government gave one percent reservation to the Gurjars and since then the matter is going on in the court itself
 supreme court ne philhal hoicourt ke aadesh ko yathasthiti main rakhaa he
 At present, 28 per cent reservation is for SC-ST and 22 per cent for obcs while one per cent is for SBC, which includes five castes including Gurjars
 lekin gurjar andolan par utaaru the or obisi ke andar hi aarakshan maang rahe the taaki court main bachaa jaae
 Experts believe that this cleverness of the government to include the SBC quota in the cobc through the bill will not affect the court and the court has already imposed a ban on more than 50 per cent reservation

 Syed Akbaruddin, India's permanent representative to the United Nations, said that if Pakistan "lowers" its level by raising the Kashmir issue during the United Nations General Assembly session to be held here next week, India will rise further
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne 27 sitambar ko neuyork main sanyukt raashtra mahasabha (yuangie) ke satr main kashmir mudde ko uthaane kii baat kahi he
 The program to address Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also on the same day
 pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne kaha he ki pradhanmantri khan yuangie main apane sambodhan ke dauraan antarrashtriya samudaay ke samaksh is mudde ko jabardast dhang se uthaaenge
 At a press conference here, Akbaruddin was asked whether he hoped to bring up the Kashmir issue during the United Nations General Assembly session, and if so, how India would deal with it
 is par akbaruddin ne kaha, ‘‘aap jo mujhase kah rahe hai, vah isse kahin adhik hoga, khaskar ek desh kii taraf se to bahut adhik hoga
 If so, what will be our response? It depends on each country how it wants to reach the global stage
 kuch aise honge jo apana str giraayenge
 Our response to them will be that we will rise higher
 vah neeche girenge lekin hamaara str to upar uthegaa
 Akbaruddin also spoke about the special features and priorities of Prime Minister Modi's address at the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri kii bahupaksheeya or dwipaksheeya vyasttaaon or baithkon ke dher saare udhaaharan is baat ko rekhaankit karte hai ki bharat kaa kad kitna ooncha hoga
 He said, "what they want to do is their wish
" hamane unhen ateet main aatankwaad ko mukhyadhara main laane kii koshish karte hue dekha he or ab jo aap mujhe bataa rahe hai, vah yah he ki ve nafrat failaane vaale bhaashan ko mukhyadhara main laana chaahate hai
 If they want to do it then it is their choice
 vah jo jehar ugal rahe hai, yah bahut lambey samay tak kaam nahin karne vaala he
 "significantly, on August 5, India abolished the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, after which tensions between India and Pakistan have increased significantly
 kashmir par bharat ke kadam par twarit pratikriya karte hue, pakistan ne bharat ke saath rajanyik sambandhon ko kamatar kar diya or bhartiya ucchayukta ko nishkasit kar diya
 Pakistan is trying to internationalize the Kashmir issue, but India has repeatedly said that the removal of Article 370 is its "internal matter"
 bharat ne pakistan se vaastaviktaa ko sweekaar karne or bharat virdohi bayaanbaji ko band karne ke liye kaha he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also seems to have followed the path of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 modi har bade aayojanon or samaaroh main hindi main hi bhaashan dene ko praathamikta dete hai, ab jetali bhi aisa karne vaale hai
 According to information received from sources, Jaitley can present the budget this time in Hindi instead of English
 aaazaad bharat ke itihaas main ab tak sabhi vitt mantriyon ne angreji main bajet pesh kiye hai
 If Jaitley presents the budget in Hindi, he will be the first Finance Minister of the country to present his budget speech in Hindi
 sutara bataate hai ki jetali ke hindi main bhaashan dene ke peeche kii ranneeti yah he ki aam log bhi bajet ke prati ruchi len, khaskar gramin anchal main rahane vaale log
 This is the last full budget of the present Modi government and through this the government will try to woo people before the general elections
 bajet main krishi ek behad ahm hissaa hota he or is baar is sector ko vishesh tarjeeh mil sakati he
 Also, if Jaitley presents the budget in Hindi, then the common man will also be interested in it, especially the farmer community can increase their interest in the budget
 haalanki vitt mantri jetali vigat ke bajet bhaashanon main bich-bich main kai baar hindi main bolte rahe hai
 He has also read many poetry in his last 3 consecutive budgets
 shaayarishahdabaashyreh munwwar ranavani prakashanmoolya 225 ru
 As Urdu poet Munawar Rana was announced the Sahitya Akademi Award on his collection Shahdaba, whispers intensified on social sites
 kaha gaya-maa par gajalen likh unhone jajbaati shaayari ko badhaava diya he yaa ve popular shaayar beshak hon lekin urdu kii mahaan shaayari parampara main ahm sthaan nahin rakhte
 On the charge of emotional poetry, Munawar himself said that his poetry is a declaration against the old age home
 vaise ve waakif hai ki maa par likhi shaayari ne unhen makabuuliyat di he-koun samajhaae ye tanakid ke shahjadon ko / maa pe ham sher na kehete to ye shoharat hoti? raibareli main janme munwwar kii kalam main avadh kii mitti kii khushboo he to antahkaran main maa, betiyon or bujurgon ke liye hamadardi
 The courtyard of his compassion is huge
 unke bheetar kaumi shaayar bhi saans letaa he, muhajiranama jisaki ek umdaa misaal he
 Shahdaba, published in 2012, is a collection of his ghazals, najmas and muktasar lions
 isamen zyaadaatar unki nai gajalen hai
 Najme has come for the first time
 haalanki jo kamaal unki gajalon main he, vah najmon main nahin
 But the face of his overall poetry is made up of his ghazals, nazams and abundant written and ideological prose
 nngalib or mir se hoti hui urdu shaayari aaj jis mukaam par aa pahunchi he, munwwar uski nai kalam hai
 He has closely observed the reality, which is exemplified at every step in his poetry - for the needs of the house, his age / child put it on the chimney of the factory
 ve siyaasi shaayar nahin hai, lekin is sangrah kii ek kamjor nas sonia gandhi par ek ghazal he to saharashri ko samarpit ek geet bhi he
 So has Shayari, considered an opposition to power, now laid its head on the frame of Sikri? This thing strikes something
 aam aadmi unki samvednaa kii jad se kabhi baahar nahin rahaa or yahi baat unki shaayari ko khaas banane kaa kaam karti he
 They decorate their poetry with colloquial language, and therefore cannot underestimate it in any way
 munwwar kii shaayari inasaaniyat ke us jazbe ko hasil karne kii disha main badhati he jahaan jati, nasl or kaum kaa fark mit jaataa he
 His signature in Ghazal is the most discrete
 bakaul munwwar-meri ghazal main meri mahak barkaraar he / har sher par he mohar-e munwwar lagi hui

 Many Union Ministers were assuming their office in 0 and Amit Shah had a name in it
 1 june ko amit shah ne grih mantralay kaa padbhaar grahan kiya
 On the same day, the question arose as to who would now see the 'house' of the BJP
 sawaal vaazib bhi tha kyonki bijepi ke 'chanakya' amit shah ab sarkaar main aa chuke the or unhen ek ahm mantralay kii jimmedaari mili thi
 Seeing his role in the government, Jagat Prakash Nadda was made the acting president of the BJP
 saath hi bijepi sansadeey board kii baithak main ye faisla hua ki agle kuch maheene tak amit shah bijepi ke adhyaksh bane rahenge
 The party won a historic victory in the Lok Sabha elections and after 5 months after this victory, after the election results of the Maharashtra, Haryana Assembly, the question has arisen whether the party did not have the same result due to Amit Shah's government
 Were able to meet grih mantralay jaise ahm vibhaag sanbhaalane ke kaaran amit shah party ko utana samay nahin de paae jiskaa asar chunaav parinaamon par padaa he
 In these five months, as the weather has changed and the mild cold has knocked, has the same effect happened in BJP
 maharashtra or haryana main number-1, lekin wo baat nahinmaharashtra or haryana vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aa chuke hai
 In Maharashtra's 288 seats, BJP is 105 and in Haryana, BJP is reduced to 40 seats
 in donon hi rajyon main bhale hi bijepi number ek par ho lekin vah apane balboote sarkaar banane main kaamyaab nahin ho pai
 Not only this, BJP has got less seats this time than last time
 pichhali baar vidhansabha chunaav main maharashtra main bijepi ko 122 siten mili thim
 At the same time, BJP has got only 105 seats this time
 vahiin haryana main pichley chunaav main bijepi ko 47 siten mili thim or apane dam par bijepi ne sarkaar banaai thi, vahiin is baar yah aankada 40 par hi simat kar rah gaya
 After the results of these two states, there is bound to be a question whether the reduced activism of bjp's 'chanakya' has affected the results
 sarkaar main badhati gai sakriyatabator grih mantri amit shah pehle din se hi active ho gaye jaise wo party main the
 They were taking many decisions one after the other
 kam samay main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne aitihaasik faisla lete hue jammu-kashmir ko visheshadhikaar dene vaale anuchhed 370 ko khatm kar diya
 This was a decision about which the BJP had been promising in its election manifesto for a long time but could not fulfill it
 amit shah ne sadan ke andar or baahar isko lekar jo sakriyata dikhaai use lambey samay tak yaad kiya jayega
 Not only abolishing Article 370 but also handling the situation after that was a big challenge, but the way Amit Shah kept a close watch on the whole issue is the result that the situation is completely under control there
 370 hi nahin kam samay main hi tripal talaak or enarasi par bhi sarkaar kii ore se ahm faisla liya gaya or yah amit shah kii sakriyata kaa hi nateeja tha
 Read: Both cms were new in haryana-maharashtra, yet we are proud to win again: PM Modiyun did not become Amit Shah in charge of Uttar Pradesh with 80 mps before bjp's 'chanakya' 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne uttar pradesh kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se 71 siton par aitihaasik jeet darj kii thi jiske baad logon ne yah kahana shuru kar diya kuch to baat he
 After this victory, Amit Shah was made the national president of BJP in July 2014
 bataur adhyaksh pehle kaarykaal main party ne kai rajyon main aitihaasik safalataa arjeet kii
 In January 2016, Amit Shah was re-elected as the bjp's national president
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main party ko aitihaasik jeet mili or is vakt bhi party ke adhyaksh amit shah hi the
 After this, there was an entry in his government and he could not give the party the same time as before
 ye mana ja rahaa tha ki grih mantralay jaise ahm vibhaag sanbhaalane ke kaaran amit shah kii party par zyada dhyaan dene kii sambhaavna kam hi rahegi
 Now after the results which have come, this question is arising that BJP will also need to think about this
 nae adhyaksh ke saamne badi chunautikaryakari adhyaksh ke rup main jepi nadda kii chunauti bijepi kii jeet kii lay ko barkaraar rakhana tha
 Assembly elections were being held in Maharashtra, Haryana for the first time after the Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi bhale hi kisi rajya main number do par nahin gai he lekin jeet he jabardast vaali baat bhi nahin
 Both these states have failed to form the BJP government on their own
 amit shah ne apane kaarykaal main bijepi ko jis mukaam par pahunchaaya he use banaae rakhana nae adhyaksh ke liye chunauti bharaa rahegaa
 JP Nadda is the executive chairman right now, but he has to present himself as a strong and powerful president along with keeping the party at the top

 He asked the people whether the bad days were gone after the formation of BJP government
 He further said, 'now those whose bad days have come, they are screaming and shouting

 ' ‘achche din aane’ ke modi sarkaar ke daawey kii congress dwaara kii ja rahi aalochanaon ke palatwaar main modi ne kaha, 'jinke bure din aae hai, unhen cheekhney chillane dijie

 In his characteristic style, he questioned the people, 'has there been any news of a scam in the last one year, has there been news of nepotism, has there been news of running the government with remote control, any story of son-in-law or son of a leader? Did the story happen? Bad days gone or not? Was there a time for loot or not? modi ne kaha, 'chunaav ke baad maine vaada kiya tha ki main pradhanmantri nahin, pradhan santari banuunga

 pradhanmantri mantri ne kaha ki hamane tay kiya he ki 100 se 100 paise logon tak jaaen or dalal ek paisa bhi luutane nahin paaen
 The Prime Minister claimed that this change would not have taken place if the new government had not been elected in place of the UPA government and if that government had remained there for a year
 unhone kaha, 'itane bure din, kitne bure karm or kitni adhik buraaiyon kaa maahaul tha or tab desh kii janata ne is maahaul ko badalane or parivartan laane kaa faisla kiya
