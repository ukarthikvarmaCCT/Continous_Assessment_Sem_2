 Udayan Raje was contesting from this seat on behalf of BJP, Raje, a descendant of Shivaji Maharaj, left the NCP and joined BJP a few days ago
 bihar main samastipur loksabhaa seat par algepi ke prince raaj ne chunavi muqabla apane naam kiya

 aisi sarkaar jo shaktishaalee congress ko nicha dikhaane vaale apane krity-baba ramdev ke aage natmastak hone ke daur se ubar chuki he
 But whatever unintended consequences Congress could have imagined, all those results became a reality and the response to this action went out of control step by step
 is karrwai ne baba ramdev or anna hajaare ko ek saath laa diya
 This aroused the sleepless BJP
 dilli ke ramlila maidan main ramdev ke samarthakon, jinamein kai apana bachaav karne main asamarth mahilaayein thim, par police ke aansu gas ke gole, laathiyaan or pathar barasaane ke drishyon ne logon kii naaraazgi ko hawa de di
 The situation was not like Jallianwala Bagh, but even Anna Hazare expressed his displeasure by fasting for a day at Rajghat on 8 June

 60 pratishat se zyada log maanate hai ki ramlila maidan par kii gai karrwai bilkul galat thi
 Apparently, in an attempt to field an ambitious Yogi against a leader who was a Gandhian for a lifetime, the government finally united two people whose demands are different - Ramdev wants the government to deposit all the black money abroad Declare the national property and prosecute treason against those who have deposited this money
 ramdev yah bhi chaahate hai ki bhrashtachar ke maamalon se nipatane ke liye vishesh adaalatein banaai jaaen or bhrasht logon ko maut kii sajaa di jaae
 The main goal of Hazare's movement is the Lokpal Bill
 anjaane main hi, sarkaar ne bade shaharon ke asardaar madhyam varg or aam jan kii vishaal shakti main bhi ekta karvaa di
 The government also targeted itself for a long season of protests
 dilli ke baad ramdev ne anshan ke liye haridwar ko chunaa
 Ramdev, who was on hunger strike on 4 June, was admitted to the hospital in Dehradun on 10 June
 jahaan unase milane art of living ke sansthaapak shri shri ravi shankar pahunche

 The BJP has announced a nationwide agitation from June 9 to June 11
 baat itani hi nahin he, ramdev ne agali baar 'astr-shastr' kaa prashikshan paae apane 11,000 samarthakon ke saath ramlila maidan par 'ravanalila' kii chetavanee di he
 Baba has said, "then let's see who thrashes

 iske alaava kuch kitaaben aapako baar baar padhni hoti hai or lagaataar khud main sudhaar karnaa hota he
 Shubham's message is clear - if you want to shine like the sun, then you will have to burn like the sun, you have to work so hard that you can change the lines of your hand

 Mehbooba Mufti said that when Mufti Saeed Sahab died, some people of the party were creating problems and pressure was made to form a government with BJP
 unhone kaha ki mujhe iske liye power projects jaise kai bade muddon ko peeche chhodana padaa
 He said that there were some people who wanted to break the party and join the BJP and form a government, all of which continuously weakened my position
 unhone phir jor dete hue kaha ki janata kii ore se jo janadesh mila tha use narendra modi ne barbaad kar diya

 sirf mir hi nahin balki kai anya netaa bhi beete ek saal main pidipi kaa saath chhod chuke hai
 Significantly, after the assembly elections, the PDP-BJP came together and formed the government, but the alliance broke down in no time

 As soon as the dates of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi are nearing, all the political parties have geared up

 rehana kahati hai ki log vot maangane aate hai, lekin hamaari jaruraton ke vakt gaayab ho jate hai, hamaari koi nahin sunata
 People allege that neither Kejriwal did anything
 ab jab chunaav sir par hai, is ilaake ke logon ko ummid he ki netaa ji phir aaenge or vot maangenge, lekin is baar itani aasaani se vot nahin milegaa
 This time the question will be asked and responsibility will be fixed

 When will Rahul Gandhi become Prime Minister? When will he take charge of the party? The Congress seems to have found the answer to these questions

 The latest reshuffle in Manmohan's cabinet at least indicates this
 or jab asar hone laga to rang bhi dikhne laga

 rahul gandhi desh ke mukhiya yani piem ban paaenge ki nahin ye to 2014 hi batayega
 But, if he is not the head of the Congress today, then at least he can be called Sarpanch

 com / sb5vpweyhi — ICC (@ICC) January 22, 2019 mausam vibhaag ne kerala ke kai zilon main red or orange alert jari kiya he
 Monsoon was weak in Kerala but there is a possibility that heavy rains may occur in many districts
 udhar mumbai main barish ke dinon main diwaar or building kaa girnaa band nahin ho rahaa he
 On July 2, 22 people were killed and 94 were injured when a wall fell in heavy rain in Malad
 mangalvaar ko dongari ilaake main ek imaarat gir gai
 This building was declared dangerous
 haadase main das log maare gaye or nau log ghayal ho gaye
 BMC has declared 499 buildings as dangerous this year
 ye wo imaaraten hai jo kaaphi puraani ho gai hai
 Rules are made in violation
 mangalvaar ko jo imaarat giri uske liye 2017 main biemasi ne patr jari kiya tha ki is imaarat ko jaldi hi khaali karakar gira diya jaae kyonki agar durghatana hui to biemasi jimmedaar nahin hogi
 The question is also why it was not dropped again for two years
 biemasi ne pichley saal bhi aisi suchi banaai thi
 619 buildings were declared dangerous
 2017 main sitambar maheene main imaarat girane kii do ghatnaayen hui thim
 61 people died after the building collapsed in Mazgaon
 yah building biemasi kii hi thi
 In the same year a five-storey building in Bhendi Bazar area collapsed
 ise khataranaak ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 33 people died in it
 2017 ke july main ghatkoper main paanch manzila imaarat gir gai thi
 12 people died
 mumbai main building girane kii ghatana main pichley paanch saal main 200 se adhik log maare ja chuke hai
 Even after this, we are arguing that BMC is not doing its job
 imaaraton ko khatarnaak ghoshit kiya ja rahaa he or unhen giraaya nahin ja rahaa he
 The Indian Express published a report in August last year
 us report ke anusaar 5 saal main mumbai main building or diwaar girane kii 2704 ghatnaayen huin thim
 840 people were injured and 234 were killed
 ek artiai ke jawaab main biemasi kii yah jaankaree he
 Until the accountability is fixed and strict steps are not taken, we will keep adding to the accidents
 gardian akhbaar ne 2017 ke sitambar main ek vishleshan chapa tha ki girane kii ashanka ke baad bhi log in khatarnaak gharon main kyon rahete hai
 The owners of old buildings do not have the capacity to build these buildings
 ve khud in gharon ko chhod kar chale jate hai or kiraaye par laga dete hai
 These renters are low income, they get cheaper house in Mumbai
 biemasi notice bhejti he ki makaan khaali karo, ise giraanaa he, iske baad bhi log alag alag kaarnon se makaan khaali nahin karte hai
 There is also a reason that when the building collapses they are asked to go to the transit camp
 pataa nahin hota ki kab imaarat giregi, kab banegi isliye ve nahin jate hai
 The Guardian has printed the statement of Chandashekhar Prabhu

 There is news for those who have been agitating for the restoration of the old pension system
 sarkaar ne kaha he ki vah puraani pension skim dobaaraa shuru nahin karegi
 The National Pension System came in 2004
 uske pehle tak nishchit maatra main pension mila karti thi
 The National Pension Scheme is linked to the market
 chunaav se pehle puraani pension vyavastha ko behaal karne ke kai andolan hue the, sarkaar ke is jawaab se spashtataa aegi or kisi kism kaa kanfuzan nahin rahegaa ki puraani vyavastha lagu ho sakati he
 Governments generally do not speak clearly on such issues
 magar is baar sarkaar ne yah spasht kar diya he ki pension kii puraani vyavastha lagu nahin hogi
 BJP mps Rakesh Singh and Srirodmal Nagar had asked the Finance Ministry the question whether the old system is considering implementation, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur said in a written reply that due to the increasing and unviable pension bill, the government Has taken the deliberate step of adopting NPS in place of Fix Pension Scheme
 is badlaav se is sarkaar ke simit sansadhano ko adhik utpaadak or saamaajik aarthik vikaas main sahaayta mili he
 Employees admitted after 1 January 2004 will not get the benefit of the old pension system
 bahut se karmchaaree hamen messej karte rahete hai ki puraani pension skim kaa mudda uthaa dijie, mere khyaal se ab zarurat nahin hogi kyonki sarkaar se unhen kushkabari mil gai he
 Well the good news for us is that people will not be troubled anymore
 ek baar phir bataa den ki puraani pension vyavastha ab lagu nahin hogi
 Nor does the government have such intention
 selfi se kya kisi yojana ko badhaava miltaa he, uski safalataa sunishchit hoti he, kya selfi se prerana milti he, agar iskaa jawaab haa main hota to aaj hamaare desh main prerana kii baadh aa chuki hoti
 Every moment, selfies are uploaded in countless numbers on social media
 guru poornima ke din bharat ke maanav sansaadhan mantri ramesh pokharial nishank ne ek video messej jari kiya he or selfi vid guru karne kii baat kii he
 Take a selfie with your guru and upload it on social media
 shiksha mantri ne kaha ki selfi vid guru karen
 So do
 kya aapane kiya
 Selfie with her mentor and wrote something on social media
 kya aapke college yaa uniwarsity ne aapako aisa karne ke liye prerit kiya, kyonki ujisi ke sachiv rajnish jain ne apane aadesh patr main yahi nivedan kiya he ki apane chaatro ko selfi vid guru abhiyaan main bhaag lene ke liye prerit karen
 If you missed being inspired today, no problem, Teacher's Day is coming, on that day you will prepare to be inspired
 15 july ko maanav sansaadhan mantri ne selfi vid guru kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 It was also his birthday that day
 shiksha mantri ke twitor handle main kai chaatro ne apane shikshakon ke saath selfi lekar tasviren bhi daali hai
 It is not necessary to be a teacher, a mother, and a friend
 mantri ji ke handle par tasveeron kii bharmaar he
 The minister himself has taken a photo with Vivekananda taking his selfie
 guru ke saath selfi twit aate hi uttar pradesh ke shikshamitra ne tag kar diya ki ve bhi to guru hai
 More than 1000 education friends have embraced death
 aap bataaiye hamen kab nyaay milegaa
 One lakh 72 thousand Shikshamitras are waiting for justice
 yah bhi ajeeb he
 The Minister is saying to do Selfie with Guru, Guru is saying to give justice to Guru
 kai saare sansthaanon ne prem se is vinamr nivedan kaa paalan kiya he
 IIT Delhi, IIT Madras, NIT Silchar tweeted pictures of Selfie with Guru
 jamiya kii website par likhaa he ki chaatro se anurodh he ki apane guru ke saath pikchar saajha karen, or 100 shabdon main apane guru ke bare main likhen jise jamiya milia islamia ke fasebuk pej par saajha kiya jayega
 We are also saying this because today you will not even know that the campaign of Selfie with Guru was going on in all the school colleges in India
 shivangi prabhudesai ne twit kiya he ki sarkaar ke vijan ko saport karte hue main apane guru ke saath selfi pesh kar rahi hum, mere guru yani shivangi yani ki main
 That means you are the teacher of Shivangi
 banaras hindu uniwarsity main bhi selfi vid guru hua he
 This handle shows that there have been many events of Selfie with Guru
 iaiti madras ne apane oficial twitor handle se twit kiya he
 Selfie with Guru is also celebrated here
 is tarah kai sansthaanon ne selfi vid guru manaaya he
 On the one hand, while the youth of India were celebrating selfie with gurus from Harsholas, the teachers of Kendriya Vidyalayas are talking about pension in this joyous time
 shaayad unhen is vakt pension kii zyaada zarurat he, selfi kii kam he
 Poonam Srivastava has tagged the Minister of Human Resources, writing that even after serving selfless service for 30-35 years, this is our condition
 pension nahin mil rahi he
 Due to this, there has been no time to die of hunger
 kya aisa ho saktaa he ki in shikshakon ko pension de di jaae or selfi vid pension kaa abhiyaan chale
 We emphasized this so that we remember what is important for students
 sarkaar prerit karnaa chaahati he, lekin log apni samasyaon ko lekar kise prerit karen ki unka kaam ho jaae
 The problem of teachers is not solved even after writing letters from the minister to the ministries
 ekatarfa prerana kaa yah abhiyaan dotarafa kyon nahin ho saktaa he
 Why not run a selfie with problem campaign and the government responds with a selfie with solution
 college main shikshak na ho, padhaane kii vyavastha na ho, leboratory na ho, koi baat nahin, selfi vid guru hona chahie
 The Government of India has presented a draft of the new education policy
 484 pej ke is draft ko padhane, samajhane or pratikriya dene ke liye ek maheene kaa samay diya gaya
 Go to the rating chapter of this draft
 neshnal assesament and acreditation council yani nack college or uniwarsity kii ranking karata he
 Abc gives grades in every college by looking at the facilities and achievements there
 isaki sachai jaan len phir ek din selfi vid everej college kaa bhi abhiyaan chale
 According to the NAC report, 68 percent of universities are below average or below average
 91 pratishat college ausat yaa ausat se bhi neeche hai
 91 percent of colleges are average and below average, it is expected that the gurus with whom Selfie with Guru's campaign was going on today
 bharat main 91 pratishat college ausat se neeche hai
 The UGC recognizes 164 universities, out of which only 140 universities were rated under NAC
 is 140 uniwarsity main se keval 32 uniwarsity ko hi e yaa e se adhik kaa grad mila he
 All other universities are average or below average
 yah he hamaari shiksha kii tasviir
 The good thing is that the students did not care about their college or university being average or below average
 selfi vid guru jaise abhiyaanon se kya hasil hota he
 On 3 July 2019, Ramesh Chandra Pokhriyal said in the Rajya Sabha that the posts of 7000 teachers in Central University are vacant
 maanavsansaadhan mantri kah rahe hai ki privet se lekar sarkari collejon main 3,44,714 pad khaali hai rajya se lekar centre tak main
 On 25 May, Ritika Chopra wrote a report on the condition of education
 indian express kii ritika shiksha ko niyamit rup se cover karti hai
 According to their report, 5 lakh posts are vacant in all higher education across India
 inamen rajyon ke vishvavidhyalay hai, central uniwarsity bhi he or anya santhaan hai
 There are not five lakh teachers across the country
 jab tak 5 lakh pad bhare na jaaen selfi vid guru kii jagah selfi vid mines guru na ho jaae
 Last month, the environment minister started a selfie with sapling campaign
 kaha tha ki saowling lagaaein or uske saath selfi khichaaen
 How and how can you rate this selfie campaign? kapil dev, jaiki shroff ne selfi vid saowling to kar liya lekin vah abhiyaan abhi kahaan he
 In 2016, Maharashtra Chief Minister Fadnavis launched the Selfie with Tree campaign
 kaha tha ki adhikari karmchaaree paudhe lagaaein or selfi khinchaa kar van vibhaag ko kuch shabd likhakar bhejein
 Some of the people will be chosen as lucky winners
 ham nahin jaanate ki 2016 main do karod ped lagaae gaye the, unamem se kitne lahalha rahe hai, jin karmchaariyon ne selfi vid tree kiya tha, unhone us tree ko kitna bachaaya he
 The goal of the Maharashtra government was to plant 50 crore trees in three years
 lakshya 50 karod ped lagane kaa tha
 In June, Devendra Fadnavis was asked in the assembly, in response to which he said that in three years, Maharashtra planted 24 crore trees
 media report ke anusaar 2018 tak 17 karod lagane kaa lakshya tha
 The target was to put 33 crores in 2019
 mukhyamantri ne 2016 se 18 tak kaa hisaab diya he ki 24 karod ped lagaae gaye
 72 percent of the trees planted in 2016 survived
 2017 main jitne ped lagaae gaye unamem se 80 pratishat batch gaye
 Of the total trees planted in 2018, 85 percent survived
 maharashtra kaa daawa he ki iske kaaran van kshetra 20 pratishat se badhkar 33 pratishat ho gaya he
 Famous environmentalist Madhav Gadgil considers these campaigns as a show
 8 agast 2018 ko unka ek bayaan hindustan times main chapa he ki sirf sankhya par jor he
 No one knows where these trees are left
 richard theller hai jinaki kitaab he naj
 On the basis of this theory, the government conducts such campaigns, which are detailed in Chapter Two of the Economic Survey
 iske tahat jor diya jaataa he ki sarkaar logon ko prerit kare
 Nudge means pushing in a gentle manner and motivating for expected behavior
 kai baar ham aise abhiyaanon ko haasyaaspad sthiti main pahunchaa dete hai
 The Parliament complex is generally clean but still the mps and Ministers came here to sweep
 safai kii yah rasaadaaygi kaa sabase bada bachaav yahi he ki logon ko prerit kiya jaataa he
 After searching for dust mites, call it selfie with a broom but it does not produce any concrete result
 har baat ke liye prerana par jor itnaa na ho jaae ki log apana kaam chhod kar ek duusare ghar use prerit karne jane lagen
 In the circle of the motivator and the apostle, the neighborhoods are waiting for cleanliness
 na safai karmchaaree he or agar he to kooda kachra phenkane kii koi vyavastha nahin he

 ’’ The nearly 200-year-old Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai is one of the richest temples in India
 bhakton ke chadhaave se mili 158 kilo sone ke bhandar se bhare is mandir kii suraksha main din-raat 65 surakshakarmi lage rahete hai
 The value of this gold kept in the temple is estimated to be around $ 67 million, or Rs 417 crore
 bharat duniya main sone kaa sabase bada khariddaar he or puraane mandiron main karodon rupee ke sone ke aabhushan or sikke jamaa he
 a few years ago, the treasure was discovered in the secret basement of the Padmanabha Swamy temple in Kerala, which is believed to be worth more than $ 20 billion, or more than Rs 1,24,750 crore
 khabar he ki centre kii modi sarkaar agle maheene ek nai yojana laane ja rahi he, jisamen mandiron ko apana sona bank main jamaa karne ke protsaahit kiya jayega
 The central government wants this gold reserves of temples to be used to overcome the long-standing trade imbalance on the Indian economy
 sone ke liye bhartiya awam kaa junun jagajaahir he or aise main sarkaar is sone ko pighla kar aabhushan nirmaataaon ko degi, jisase ki sone ke aayaat par ankush lagaaya ja sake
 The point to note here is that in the fiscal year ended in March 2013, the percentage of gold imports was 28% of India's total trade deficit
 sarkaar or swarna udyog se jude sutara bataate hai ki bharat har saal 800 se 1000 ton sona aayaat karata he
 The government hopes that if the temples show interest in the scheme, the country's total gold imports will come down to one-fourth
 is sambandh main siddhivinayak mandir trust ke adhyaksh narendra murari rane kehete hai, 'agar yah yojana laabhadaayak or surakshit he, to hamen sarkaar kii aisi kisi yojana kaa hissaa banakar apana sona rashtriya bainkon main jamaa karne main khushi hogi
 However, a gold merchant from Mumbai says that he and his father have offered nearly 200 kg of gold at the Siddhivinayak temple so far
 unka kahana he ki shraddha ke chadhaave par mandiron kaa byaaj lenaa paap hoga
 The 52-year-old businessman says, 'I made an offering to God and not to a temple trust
 'isi yojana se milti-julati ek yojana 1999 main bhi lagu kii gai thi, lekin vah yojana isliye safal nahin ho pai, kyonki sarkaar kii taraf se bainkon ko jis byaaj dar kii peshkash kii gai thi vah mandiron kii ummid se kaaphi kam thi
 State Bank of India 0 under that scheme
 75 se 1 pratishat kaa byaaj detaa he
 It is worth noting that under that scheme only 15 tonnes of gold has been deposited in the bank so far
 vahiin mandiron kaa kahana he ki ve ummid karte hai ki nai yojana main aakarshak byaaj daron kaa praavdhaan kiya jayega
 The government will disclose the interest rates only when the scheme is officially announced

 Azad took up the matter during the Zero Hour in the House, saying that such incidents have been coming up in the IPL matches every day for a few days which are embarrassing the country
 unhone kaha ki guuruuvaar der raat ek party main ek videshi mahila ke saath ipel team ke ek khilaadi ne kathith rup se balaatkaar kii koshish kii lekin khilaadi ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii bajaay maamle ko dhaanpane kii koshish kii ja rahi he

 aisa nahin he ham iskaa jawaab daakhil karenge
 The bench directed the Land and Development Office to file a reply to the report of the monitoring committee within seven days and listed the matter for hearing thereafter

 (from input language) pakistan main aatankiyon ke surakshit thikaanon kaa akalan karte hue pentagon ne america congress ko bataaya he ki vah shreshth bhartiya sena se muqabla karne ke liye aatanki samoohon kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 The Pentagon, in its most recent half-yearly report, told the Congress about the current situation in Afghanistan, that terrorists targeting Afghanistan and India are continuously working with Pakistan to damage Afghan and regional stability
 pakistan in aatanki balon kaa istemaal afghanistan main apane prabhaav main ai kami ke khilaaf or bharat kii shreshth sena se muqabla karne ke liye kar rahaa he
 The Pentagon said in its report of more than 100 pages, "this relationship is contrary to Pakistan's public commitment to support the Afghan-led friendship
" in samoohon kaa afgaan-pakistan ke dwipaksheeya sambandhon main ek praathmik uttejk bal ke rup main kaam karnaa abhi bhi jari he
 In the context of the attack on the Indian consulate in Herat, the Pentagon said that the attack was carried out just before the swearing-in ceremony of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister of India
 pentagon ne kaha, report kii is avadhi ke dauraan may main baari hathiyaaron se las chaar aatankiyon ke samooh ne heraat praant sthit bhartiya vaanijya duutavas par hamalaa bolaa
 The attack took place just three days before the swearing-in ceremony of the new Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi
 pradhanmantri modi ko hindu rashtravaadi samoohon ke kareeb mana jaataa he
 This fact may have been behind the time of this attack
 report main kaha gaya, june main, america videsh mantralay ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki hamale ke liye aatanki samooh lashkar-e-taiyaba jimmedaar tha
 Former Afghan President Karzai strongly condemned the attack, supporting relations with India
 pentagon ne congress ko suchit kiya ki bharat abhi bhi afghanistan kaa sahyog kar rahaa he, kyonki uskaa maananaa he ki ek surakshit or sthir afghanistan is kshetra ke liye phydemand hoga or madhya asia main aarthik galiyaaron ke liye madadgaar hoga
 The report said, India and Afghanistan signed a declaration of a strategic partnership in 2011, formalizing cooperation on governance, economics, commerce, education, public administration and security and law enforcement

 They are missing few of their key players in this match

 India had their biggest win in this match by an innings margin
 match main pehle ballebaaji karte hue bhartiya team ne apni pari 9 wicket par 649 ran banane ke baad ghoshit kii thi
 Prithvi Shaw, captain Virat Kohli and all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja had scored centuries
 jawaab main westeindies ke ballebaajon ne match main kisi bhi tarah kaa sangharsh kaa madda nahin dikhaaya tha
 West Indies' first innings was 181 and the second innings ended on 196 runs

 Devine would like to make one thing clear
 mumbai ke hip-hop seen ko lekar banaai gai joya akhtar kii aane vaali film gali boy byopic nahin he—haalanki yah unke or mumbai ke hi unke saathi raper naiji ke tajurbon se kaaphi kuch leti he
 The 27-year-old Divine, whose real name is Vivian Fernandes, says, "some of the events in our lives (are in it)," such as how Ranveer's portrayed character explores hip-hop and how he makes it
 ''divine kii jindagi kii asal kahani ek documentary film main dikhaai jaaegi jise philhal red bul media house bana rahaa he
 He has also made his new solo video One Side from his upcoming debut EP album
 jaisaa ki meri gali main or farak sareekhe gaanon main dikhaaya gaya he, divine kurlaa or andheri east kii galiyon or chaalon main bade hue

 He tried his hand at gospel or Christian rap — he also got the name Divine from that time

 Director Akhtar and Sushil Chugani of Sony Music India got their eye on his work in a concert held at the now-closed venue Blue Frog in Mumbai
 udhar akhtar ko gali boy banane kaa vichaar soojha or idhar chhugaani ne chutki bajaate divine ke saath contract sin kar liya
 Chugani says, "we saw a variety of reality and honesty (in them)
 '' chhugaani ab divine ke manager to nahin hai par unke kareebi dost hai or anadhikarik taur par unhen guide karte rahete hai
 Bass music producer Udayan Sagar aka Nucleia, who took Divine as a guest artist on his last two albums, agrees with Chugani
 ve kehete hai, "unki aawaaj main gaharaa bharosa he jo banaavati nahin ho saktaa
 "we will know how much Gully Boy catches the Mumbai scenes with reality when it releases on Valentine's Day next year, but Divine believes the film will give Bollywood the first" valid hip-hop sound track
 gali rap gane vaale kai sthaneey emasi is album main dikhaai denge
 Gully rap means that sub-genre of rap that is attributed to Divine and Nazi
 aaj dharavi sareekhe kam aamadani vaale ilaakon ke yuva raper badi taadaad main is style ko apana rahe hai
 Through this, they are also speaking their mind and using it to make themselves strong
 divine haal hi ke ek "sifer'' kaa zikr karte hai, jisamen ranvir singh bhi aae the or jisaki ek clip online bhi daali gai thi, or kehete hai, "ve sab apni pareshaaniyon ke bare main rap ga rahe hai
 (in their rhymes) are words that are used only in the street
 ''gali rap ke hisse main tarif ke saath aalochana bhi—or yahaan tak ki makhul bhi uda he
 But Devine was never bitten by the parody that comedians like Mumbai's comedy group Tadpatri Talkies do
 unako sahaara dene vaale band main pentagram se guitar vadak randolf korea, inds kride ke drumer jai rove kavi or skyharbar ke basist krishna jhaveri shaamil hai
 Along with Gully Boy, who were set to perform, Divine has also recorded tracks for other filmmakers who were looking for a certain type of gritty
 bollywood ko unke yogadan main boxing par bani anuraag kashyap kii mukkaabaz main newclia kaa gaaya gaanaa or abhinay deol kii abhi-abhi relies hui film blackmel ke liye amit trivedi kii banaai ek dhun shaamil hai
 The marketers have also turned to their street style
 pichley saal puma ke liye sued gali record karavaaya tha, to abhi haal hi main hero ne unhen nai bike launch ke liye ek gaanaa record karne ke liye liya tha
 Divine says that "street rap" cannot be so "real" that it does not make any money
 '' baat ko or saaf karte hue ve kehete hai, "main yah nahin kah rahaa hum ki ham karodon rupye bananaa chaahate hai par kam se kam kuch rakam, jisase ham apane sangeet kii khatir kuch kar saken

 They say, "I love this place

 "although he is not a professional producer, Divine has a rare ability to make rhythm and tune creators, in the words of Chugani," get their vision done for any track "
 *** With the help of Jasprit Bumrah's fine bowling, Mumbai Indians defeated Royal Challengers Bangalore by six runs in IPL 12, while defiling AB de Villiers (70 not out)

 It was fifteen years ago when India Today carried out its first survey of the best colleges
 yah silsilaa 1997 se yun hi barkaraar he
 Since then the picture of higher education has changed to a great extent
 collejon kii sankhya tab ke 9,500 ke aankade se bad kar ab 30,000 ko paar kar gai he
 The number of students enrolled in them increased from 55 lakh to 1
 69 karod pahunch chuki he
 What has not changed in the last 15 years is the discussion on higher education
 india today ne 1997 main ucch shiksha ke sankat par likhaa tha
 Now the kind of ruckus the new system of entrance exams of other engineering colleges, including IIT in 2012, shows that the sky of higher education is once again clouded
 bhale hi vakt ke saath collejon or vishvavidhyalayon kii sankhya main ijapha hua ho, lekin desh main ab bhi iity yaa dilli ke saint stephens, ladi shriram, shriram college of commers; kolkata ke presidency college; chennai ke loyola college; mumbai ke saint jevirs college ke str ke sansthaanon kii kami he jo yuvaaon kii aakankshaon ko puraa kar paane main sakasham hon
 For the past 15 years, these colleges and some other colleges have topped the rankings
 top collejon ko unki jagah se hataa paanaa aasaan to nahin, lekin ranking aisi honi chahie jo pratispardhaa ko badha sake taaki 30,000 collejon main se prayek apane str ko uthaa sake or top10 main nahin to 100 main hi aane ke liye koshish kare
 From the government point of view, it is easier for him to reduce the top quality and create equal opportunities for everyone
 darasal, sarkaar dwaara poshit ejineering collejon ke liye sanyukt pravesh pariksha kaa uddeshy yahi he jise lekar vibhinn iity kii aapattiyon ko sire se darkinar kar diya gaya he
 In our opinion, colleges in India should not be pushed into a race that leads them downwards
 isaki bajaae unhen sheersh par pahunchane vaali daud kaa hissaa banane dena chahie
 This year, for the first time in the last decade, we have taken a step towards expanding our survey and added five new branches in addition to Arts, Science, Commerce, Engineering, Medicine and Law - Bachelor of Business
 Adding new branches like Administration (BBA), Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA), Mass Communication and Journalism, Fine Arts and Fashion Technology in Higher Education Recognizing the diversification and expansion happening
 udaarikaran ke lagu hone ke do dashak baad aisi nai profeshnal digriyon kii maang badi he jo yuvaaon ko aakarshak rojgaar paane main sakasham banaati hai
 The growth in demand for these five new branches is directly linked to the boom in some sectors of the Indian economy
 bisie sirf bharat main di jane vaali graduate str kii degree he jo yuvaaon ko programmer banaati he
 After achieving this, it becomes easy to get employment in the IT sector
 bibie karne vaale chaatr industry main manageron kii us kami ko puraa karte hai jise akele emb chaatr puraa nahin kar pate
 Journalism and mass media are fast growing sectors
 bharat duniya ke un kuchhek deshon main se he jahaan hdhint media ab bhi majbootee se bad kar rahaa he, saath hi electronic or digital media kaa bhi prasar ho rahaa he
 In the last five years, Indian fashion and art have also been recognized on the world stage
 mahangaa fishan or art kaa gharelu bazaar to prati vyakti aay kii maujuuda sthiti main hameshaa simit hi bana rahegaa, lekin antarrashtriya bazaar tak uski pahunch ne yuvaaon ke liye jabardast sambhaavnaaen paidaa kar di hai
 Diversification of options in higher education is also an opportunity for institutions to make their way
 nabbe ke dashak main bangaloru sthit neshnal lau skool of india uniwarsity ne khaali jagah bharne ke liye barahavin paas chaatro ko apane yahaan daakhila diya tha
 This time, the top 25 law institutions include many names that did not exist in 1997 when India Today conducted the survey for the first time
 inamen se ek naam hyderabad ke eneelr kaa bhi liya ja saktaa he
 This time, relatively new institutions have made their way into the BBA and BCA
 donon hi shakhaon main sheersh paanch main shaamil do santhaan-bangaloru kii christ uniwarsity or chennai kii esarem uniwarsity nijee kshetra ke dimd vishvavidhyalay hai jinhone ucchstareey buniyadi dhaancha uplabdh karaane main behtareen kaam kiya he
 New institutions are adapting themselves to new courses at a much faster rate than the older ones
 masalan, apni sthapana ke 125 saal baad bhi dilli ke saint steffens college main bikom kaa degree course nahin he
 Looking at the current scenario, it seems that in the coming times, our higher education system will be run by private institutions which will not get any government help
 aise main sarkaar ko niyaman kaa kaam to karnaa hi hoga jisase yah sunishchit kiya ja sake ki gaiyr-bharosemand or sirfpaisa ugaahne ke uddeshy se is kshetra main aane vaale santhaan kam se kam gunvattta ko kharaab na kar saken
 The unfortunate situation is that the bill to create a new higher education regulator, the National Commission for Higher Education and Research, has not yet been introduced in Parliament, instead of institutions that have lost credibility such as University Grants Commission and All India Council on Technical Education (AICTE)
 
 niamak praadhikaran ko sthirataa dene ke liye is bill ko sansad main pesh kiya janaa nirnaayak hoga
 The government should also form a consensus on the Foreign Universities Bill so that India can become the host of some of the best educational institutions in the world
 sarkaar ko kisi bhi keemat par aisi vyavastha kaayam kerani hogi jisamen nijee santhaan achche se fal-phool saken or aapas main swasth pratispardhaa bhi kaayam kar saken
 It is to be hoped that 15 years from today, India Today's ranking in 2027 will be seen reflecting this spirit and effort
 buudhvaar raat jeenyu ek baar phir chaatr sangh chunaav ke rang main sarabor najar aayaa

 The Congress has fiercely attacked the UP government over the Sonbhadra massacre
 congress ne upi sarkaar par aropiyon ke saath khadey rahane kii baat kahi he
 Party's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told reporters that the massacre of Sonbhadra is against the poor and farmers of the country
 ye hatyaein sansthagat maani jaaen
 He said that instead of giving justice to the victims, the government of Ajay Singh alias Adityanath is engaged in suppressing the leaders of opposition parties
 randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki priyanka gandhi kaa kasoor itnaa hi he ki vah peediton se milanaa or unke aansu ponchna chaahati thim
 Surjewala said that Umbha, the village of the aggrieved tribals, has been made a police camp
 kisi ke bhi aane jane par roak laga di gai he
 Are there terrorists and extremists? adityanath sarkaar ne 19 oktober 2017 ko adivaasiyon kii jameen ko mukhya aaropee ke naam kar di
 The Yogi government wants to occupy the land of the tribals
 unhone kaha ki adivasee kisaan ke khilaaf kai praathmiki darj kii gayi
 The tribals applied to the District Magistrate but no hearing was held
 unhone kaha ki yah adityanath sarkaar kaa shadyantra nahin to kya he?sachai yah he ki adityanath sarkaar aparaadhiyo ko sangrakshan de rahi he
 She stands with the criminals at Sonbhadra
 ham narsanhaar ke peediton ko nyaay dilaane ke liye har sambhav kadam uthaaenge
 Surjewala also asked whether the Adityanath government would be able to suppress the truth by turning the entire Umbha village (sonbhadra) into a police camp
 Why does the BJP government fear Priyanka Gandhi? gauratlab he ki priyanka ko shuukravaar ko sonbhadra jane se prashasan ne roak diya gaya tha

 (input bhashaa se) Shah Rukh Khan, once called the uncrowned king of Bollywood, is now in danger
 duusare kalakaaron kii tulana main unki filmon kaa girtaa collection is baat kaa hi pramaan he ki shahrukh main ab pehle vaale super star jaisi baat nahin rahi
 Or simply say that all the figures, audience reactions and critical reviews only confirm that Shah Rukh's stardom is now downhill
 1
 Can't do anything new Shah Rukh has to understand that the audience who have been bored after listening to 'rahul' (must have heard the name) of some time wants something new
 kahani or abhinay ke maamle menshahrukhkuch nayaa nahin kar paa rahe hai
 The audience was disappointed with his subsequent films
 'raa-van', 'jab tak he jaan', 'chennai express', 'happy new year', 'dilavaale' or ab 'fain'
 This is the list of Shahrukh's films which have created a tremendous hype
 lekin in filmon kaa anjaam aapke saamne hi tha
 Out of this list, except 'chennai Express' (that too only in terms of earnings), the other films could not do anything special
 'chennai express' bhale hi kamai ke maamle main shahrukh ke liye raahat lekar ai thi, lekin film kii kahani or unke abhinay ko critics or audiyans donon ne hi nakaar diya tha
 Shah Rukh Khan also had high expectations from the recently released film 'fan', but the film could not do business as expected at the box office
 105 karod kii laagat se bani film 'fain' bhi apni laagat ke hisaab se hit vaali category main feet nahin ho saki he
 2
 lagaataar gir rahaa filmon kii kamai kaa graphshahrukh kii filmon kii kamai lagaataar gir rahi he
 Shahrukh's film 'chennai Express' earned 227 crores, 'happy New Year' 203 crores, 'dilwale' earned only 135 crores
 'fain' 100 karod ke club main shaamil hone ke liye kuhaniyon ke bal ghist-ghist kar chal rahi he
 At the same time, films of other stars of similar stature in Bollywood are making a big bang
 3
 Nowhere is Badshahdahan among the top 5 highest grossing Bollywood films in the world, no film of Shahrukh is named
 vahiin bollywood main unke sabase bade pratidwandi ke taur par dekhe jane vaale aamir khan or salmaan khan kii do-do filmein is list main shaamil hai
 These are the 5 highest-grossing Bollywood films worldwide: PK-740 crores, Bajrangi Bhaijaan-626 crores, Bahubali-600 crores, Dhoom 3-542 crores, Prem Ratan Dhan Payo-431 crores Rupees 4
 nae-puraane pratidaadiyon kii bheed main ho rahe gumbollywood ke badshaah kii gaddiki daud main shahrukh ko naa sirf aamir or salmaan se baar-baar pachhad mil rahi he, balki akshay kumaar or ranvir singh bhi bollywood ke takht ke liye taal thonk rahe hai
 Akshay Kumar's successive films are proving to be hits
 vahiin darshak or aalochak bhi unke abhinay kii tarif karne ko majaboor hai
 The film 'airlift' earned a lot of appreciation for Akshay's acting as well
 film dar film abhinay kaa loha manwaane vaale abhinayta ranvir singh ko bhi shahrukh kii gaddi ke prabal daavedaar ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Ranveer's performance in the film 'bajirao Mastani' has led many critics and critics to accept him
 5
 Shah Rukh is not even in the opinion of the expert, Badshahtraad analyst Komal Nahata said in a statement that the only reason for the fan not to perform well is that the audience did not like the film
 vahiin trade enlist girish johar ne twit kiya ki film 'fain' menshahrukhake achche abhinay ke baavjood audiyans ne film ko isliye pasand nahin kiya kyonki isamen kuch bhi exciting nahin tha
 6
 dikhne laga he ki khisakati jameen kaa dabaavashaahrukh khan ke haav-bhav se bhi najar aane laga he ki wo apane staradam kii khisakati jameen ke chalate dabaav main hai, joki ek badshaah ke liye katai thik nahin
 During the promotion of the film 'fan', Shah Rukh had said that he does not follow the tricks for the success of the film
 lekin yah ek star kii ojhal ho rahi chhavi kaa hi nateeja tha ki shahrukh ne pehali baar film main unki parformens ke liye badhai dene vaali tamaam hastiyon or phens ke twit ko ritvit kiya
 Not only this, Shah Rukh thanked his fans for watching the film by posting videos on Facebook and Twitter for the first time
 twitor trend set karne ke liye apil aadi, is tarah ke hatkande apnaanaa isi baat kaa sanket hai ki girte graph ke saath-saath king khan kii bechaini bhi dinon din badhati hi ja rahi he
 7
 nae stars bhi saath kaam karne ko nahin taiyarek samay tha jab bollywood kaa har sitara shahrukh ke saath kaam karnaa chahta tha
 In some interview, some star used to say that he is waiting to work with Shahrukh
 lekin ab vakt badal chukaa he
 Perhaps the new artists are not even giving him a sense due to Shah Rukh's falling graph
 darasal shahrukh khan superhit film 'ittefaq' kaa rimek banane ja rahe hai
 His first choice for this film was Varun Dhawan, but Varun sidelined himself by pretending not to have time
 lekin ise vakt kii maar kahen yaa phir nae kalakaaron kaa confidence ki nae chore bhi shahrukh ke saath kaam karne se bachate najar aa rahe hai
 8
 takht bachaane ko baichaiyn, kar rahe samjhautekhud ko bollywood kaa badshaah kahalaane vaale shahrukh kaa singhaasana is samay dol rahaa he
 As a result, they are restless
 wo koi bhi risk nahin lenaa chaahate
 There were earlier reports that 'sultan' and 'raees' will clash on the occasion of Eid
 kaha ja rahaa tha ki salmaan apni film 'sultan' ko id par relies karne ko lekar ade hai or shahrukh bhi isi din 'rais' ko relies karenge
 But before release, Raees gave up and postponed the release of the film
 film kii relies ko taalane kaa faisla bhi is baat kaa hi sanket he ki shahrukh apni gaddi bachaane ke liye kuch bhi karne ko taiyaar hai
 His Star Attitude has disappeared somewhere and he can compromise
 9
 There is a saying about Bollywood, which is doing its special criticism, that the sun rising here is saluted
 is kahawat kaa matlab ab shahrukh ko bakhubi samaj aa rahaa hoga
 Jaya Bachchan, who once described Shahrukh as a member of the house, called her film 'happy New Year' as rubbish and 'the stupidest film'
 yahi nahin kabhi on screen shahrukh kii best jodidar raheen kaajol ne film 'dilavaale' main kaam karne ke apane faisle par pachhtaawaa hone kii baat karke shahrukh ko jhatka diya tha
 Varun Dhawan has convinced Shahrukh not once but twice, by gestures that your stardom is over now
 isiilie to pehle unhone film 'dilavaale' kaa hissaa hone par afsos jataayaa tha or ab unki film main kaam karne se inkaar kar diya
 Ram Gopal Varma, who is often in the limelight for his controversial statements, has also hinted at Shahrukh's day
 unhone shahrukh ko chetate hue kaha ki shahrukh bahut jald hi apana staradam salmaan khan ke haathon ganvaa denge
 These are all things that question Shahrukh's claims of being the king of Bollywood
 iskar vibhaag ko abhinetri katrine caff ke khilaaf iskar kii chori kaa koi saboot nahin mila he
 The Income Tax Department raided Katrina Kaif's house on Monday for suspected tax evasion on advertisements, foreign assignments and income from working as guest artist
 iskar vibhaag ne brands ke prachaar-prasar, videshon main milane vaale asinament or nijee pradarshnon main kar chori kii gahari chaanbin kii
 Raids were conducted in the flat on the seventh floor of the Guldev Sagar building in suburban Bandra area of katrina
 katrina ke alaava priyanka chopra ke ghar, priyanka chopra ke sachiv chand mishra ke ghar, photographer atul kasbekar ke awaas va offis par chapa maaraa gaya tha
 While Reshma Shetty's talent management company 'matrix' was also raided as Sandhya, who works as a manager, also handles the management for Katrina
 chaape ke baad jab khabaron main yah aayaa ki katrina ke paas aay ke gyaat sroton se adhik sampati pai gai he to katrina ke chatard accounted kii taraf se ek bayaan jari kiya gaya
 This statement said, 'katrina Kaif's residence was investigated by the Income Tax Department
 iske baad media main ai us tarah kii khabaron se katrina ko kaaphi pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padaa jinamein kaha gaya ki katrina ne aay se adhik sampati ke strot kaa khulaasa kiya he jisaki keemat karodon main he
 There is no such thing nor has he disclosed any such property
 katrina iskar vibhaag ke saath puri tarah sahyog kar rahi hai
 ' sahitya ajtak ke 'hindi hai ham' satr main bolte hue kavi ashok vaajapeyi ne kaha ki yah dharna galat he ki bhashaa pichad rahi he
 Language continues to grow and grow
 gatisheel rahati he
 Mobility takes language forward
 desh kaa number ek news channel aaj tak dwaara yojit sahitya mahakumbh ke tisare seshan main hindi hai ham- 21veen sadi main kya hindi pichad rahi he? vishay par hindi ke sahityakar or lekhak ashok vaajapeyi ke saath mridula garg maujuud raheen
 Speaking on the occasion, famous female writer Mridula Garg said that it is wrong to compare books with films as the world of books is wide and she gives the reader the knowledge and imagination
 kitaaben filmon se badi hoti hai or behatar bhi
 Taking this further, Ashok Vajpayee said that the truth of literature is incomplete
 pathak ise puraa karata he
 There, through virtuous Prasoon Vajpayee, she interacted with the audience
 sawaal- jab bhashaa kii baat ho to saamaajik sarokaar kii baat ho? jaise gaanv main baat dharm par hoti he, shahar main dharmandhta hoti he
 If we look at the irony of our society or language, then you find that there are many more than the author
 pathak yaa rasik jab padhata he to vah apane sach main lekhak ke sach ko mila kar lekhata he
 Movies do not leave you alone
 kitaaben aapako kalpanaaon ke athaah sagar main chhod detii hai
 There is irony in the region of Hindi
 duusari bhashaaon kaa madhyavarg jaise asamiya or bengali vah apane sahityakaron ko puraa sammaan detaa he
 There are 46 dialects in Hindi
 hindi to bas unhen baandhne kaa kaam karti he, or yah ganit meraa nahin he
 Hindi is the contact language of the region
 hindi kaa madhyavarg apni bhashaa se dur bhaagane vaala madhyavarg he
 Apart from this, Hindi is also caught in communalism, ethnicity and regionalism in the region
 mridula garg kahati hai ki china main bhi hajaaron boliyaan hai, lekin unhone mandarin ko sabase upar maan liya he
 25 Chinese sitting around must be speaking different dialects, Mridula says that the word secular is the most frightening and terrible
 hamane dharm ko daraavna or ulajhaau bana diya he
 Religion is a personal matter for me
 main us par koi safai nahin dena chaahati
 Ashok Vajpayee - i get spiritual happiness when i am caught in the case of rape and murder of Dhongi Baba who grows up in a Hindi zone
 ek shankaracharya pakadaa gaya magar vah sabooton ke abhaav main chhot gaya
 My mother was just 5th, but she used to worship two pages of Ramacharitmanas
 logon ko yah sabak sikhaaya janaa chahie ki dharm nijee maamla he
 Public needs to be aware of this in a democracy
 sawaal- sahitya kaa dharm se na takaraana?sahitya hameshaa se hi dharm ke khilaaf rahaa he
 Literature has always collided
 pichley 50 varshon ke sahitya ko aap dharmik, naitik orraajnneetik satta ke virodhake taur par dekh sakate hai
 That thing is different that our eyesight to see these things has become very big
 hamaara kaam likhnaa he
 Sometimes there is dramaticness in it
 sawaal- kya likhte samay kisi kism kaa dabaav hota he ki film ban jaae, kitaab commercial ho jaae
 Mridula - It does not happen to me
 meri samaj he ki lekhak hameshaa unheen shabdon kaa istemaal karata he jo samaaj main vyaapt he
 For example, if you go to a slaughterhouse or a kitchen, the words will be used there
 lekhak kai baar shabd gadhata bhi he
 Expects the reader to read a hundred types of truth and choose his truth
 ashok vaajapeyi- lekhak ke paas bhashaa or sachai hi he
 Writers also always doubt themselves
 sachche lekhak to vahiin hai jo khud par shaq karen
 Mridula - Language is not lagging behind
 bhashaa main to hameshaa shabd jud rahe hai
 Hindi is lagging behind
 kai baar ham ashleelata ko lekar funs jate hai
 Like people decide which words are vulgar
 unhen mahilaayein to na hi bolen
 The risk of miscarriage is highest in early pregnancy, so women need to be most cautious during this period
 kai baar to aisa hota he ki laaparvaahee ke chalate hi garbhpaat ho jaataa he
 At the same time, abortion is natural in which abortions occur due to the release of nutrients
 par kai baar kuch kaarak bhi jimmedaar hote hai
 Other causes of miscarriage: 1
 garbhavastha ke dauraan maa kaa swasth hona aavashyak he
 If the health of the mother worsens, then it directly affects the fetus growing in the womb
 hai blad pressure, madhumeh kuch aisi sthitiyaan hai jinamein bhrun ko nuksaan pahunchane kaa khatrabadh jaataa he
 2
 garbhavastha ke dauraan maa kaa dhumrapaan karnaa bhrun ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 The child does not get sufficient amount of oxygen due to smoking
 aisi sthiti main garbhpaat kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 3
 bahut adhik tanaav lenaa bhi garbh main pal rahe bachche ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 If the mother is happy then it has a positive effect on the child
 4
 Many times pregnant women eat something that is prohibited during pregnancy
 adhpaka maance yaa basi khaanaa khaanaa mahila or garbh main pal rahe bachche ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 5
 iske alaava alcohol kaa seven karnaa bhi bhrun ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Lack of folic acid in the mother's body can also harm the fetus
 android yugers or yphone (ios) yugers main ek tarah kii pratidwandita rahati he
 This news can prove to be good for Google and Android users
 kanjumar intelligence research partner (CRIP) ke mutabik loylty ke maamle main ios se aage android he
 Android users are more loyal than ios
 is research agency ne kaha he 2015 se 2016 ke bich android or ioes smartfones ke liye yugers kii loylati badi he
 In 2017, the loyalty rate of Android was 91 percent, while ios remained at 86 percent
 is report main kaha gaya he ki android yugers kii nishtha iske liye 2016 se lagaataar badhati ja rahi he, lekin abhi yah sabase zyada he
 In 2013, ios users were more loyal than Android, but from January 2016 to December 2017, Android overtook ios
 haalanki is agency ne apni report main yah bhi kaha he ki yah bhi dhyaan main rakhana hoga ki android customers ios ke mukaable zyada hai
 So Android users are more in terms of switching from Android to ios
 loylati testing ke liye is agency ne un america customers kaa pratishat nikaala jo 2017 main apane phone ko apgrade karne ke baavjood puraane oparating system par hi rahe
 91 percent remained with the Android operating system, while 86 percent remained with ios
 china kaa nayaa saal aane vaala he or adhiktar companiyaan apane karmchaariyon ko bonus de rahi hai
 However, the style of distributing the bonus of a steel plant company in Nanchang city in Jiashi province of China is most unique
 shanghaist ke mutabik, steel plant ne kareeb 44 million dollar ke bank ke noton se cash kaa ek pahaad bana diya
 This cash was to be given to all employees in bonuses, but the company adopted this unique method
 company ne apane 5000 karmchaariyon main cash baanta
 Each lucky employee received Rs 62 lakh as bonus at the end of the year
 ek karmchaaree ne shanghaisti ko bataaya, 'itnaa bada bonus he, mujhe samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki main ise kahaan kharch karun
 'this is not the first time that a Chinese company has adopted a strange way of distributing bonuses
 pichley saal ek company ne apane karmchaariyon ko ek gemsho par aadhaarit cash grab main shaamil kiya tha
 It used to provide an opportunity to collect cash within a limited time

 a few days ago, the body of Manish Tiwari, a SP leader from Kanpur, was found from a deserted place
 lekin tab kisi ne bhi nahin sochaa tha ki uske katl ke peeche itani chaunkaanewaali vajah hogi
 Now that the mask has been removed from the murderer's face, such a story of relationship screwing and blackmailing has come to light that even the police themselves are shocked
 police kii maane to manish ek aisi ladki ko uske personal video ke jariye blackmel kar rahaa tha, jise kabhi wo khud apni bahan kaha karata tha
 According to the information, Manish Tiwari was the city secretary of the sp's student body in Kanpur
 uske kai rasukhdaar logon se bhi rishte the
 But in the glare of this relationship, his mind wandered so much that he started destroying a family
 manish kii property dealer sandip singh kii bivi vineeta se mulaakaat ek samar fere ke dauraan hui thi
 He started visiting Vinita's house
 vah vineeta ko didi kaha karata tha
 But the sibling relationship of brother and sister got stained daily
 vineeta ne bataaya ki manish ne chori se uske or uske pati ke kuch nijee video or kol recording hasil kar liye
 Through them, the husband and wife started cobling
 pehle to manish ne sandip or vineeta se paanch lakh rupye vasule or phir ek ke baad ek or bhi nazaij maangen rakhane laga
 But the night of June 2 was limited
 manish is roj phir se is property dealer ke ghar pahunchaa
 He started blackmailing them
 baat bighad gai or kahasuni shuru ho gai
 Talk grew
 isi kahasuni ke bich manish ne vineeta or sandip kii chaar saal kii maasoom beti ke liye wo baat kah gaya, jo ek maa se bardaasht nahin hui or usne apane pati ke saath mil kar manish ko kapadaa dhonevaale thapki or sil-batte se maar karmout ke ghatutaar diya
 After this, the husband and wife together threw Manish's corpse at a secluded place in Chakeri area
 lekin mritak ke phone kol kii detail or lokation ke jariye police ko maamla sulajhane main zyada der nahin lagi
 However, experts say that Manish had formed his relationship with many powerful people on the pretext of Netagiri

 'jai telugana' kii narebaaji karte hue tiares sadasyon ne rajyapal ke abhibhaashan kii prati fadkar un par phenk di
 The Governor's security personnel, however, did not allow the torn pieces of paper to reach him
 rajyapal ne jaise hi apana abhibhaashan shuru kiya, tiares ke sadasyon ne 'jai telugana!' or 'rajyapal jaao!' kii narebaaji kii
 Members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also supported him
 tiares kaa aarope he ki rajyapal alag telugana rajya ke gathan ko rokane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The slogans of TRS and BJP members, however, did not affect the Governor and he completed his address
 iske baad unhone sabhi sadasyon ko badhai di
 The main opposition parties, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the Communist Party of India (CPI), the Communist Party of india-marxist (CPI-M), boycotted it, terming the Governor's address as a 'bundle of lies'
 algepi saansad or party ke sansadeey board ke adhyakshachiraag paswaanne kaha he kiandiemen unki party ko sammanjanak siten chahie
 He said that he would welcome it if BJP-JDU split the remaining seats equally after giving seats to allies

 Chirag said, "the state president of our party also demanded seven seats, but when you are involved in the alliance, it has its own limits and dignity
 aapako uskaa bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga
 Chirag said that our priority is to strengthen the alliance and make Narendra Modi prime minister again in 2019
 idhar algepi ke kashmakash par argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ne bhi chutki lee he
 Former Bihar Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav said that Ram Vilas Paswan's silence in the matter says a lot
 tejasvi ne kaha, "chiraag paswan kam seat milane kii baat jarur kar rahe hai, lekin jab tak kisi dal kaa rashtriya adhyaksh virodh darj nahin karaata to tab tak uski baat nahin suni jaati
 "he said that Ram Vilas Paswan has not yet given any statement on this formula, he is silent and says a lot of his silence

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) pramukh mohan bhagwat ke ‘bharat mata kii jai’ ke naare se jude bayaan ke baad 'vande maataram' or bhagava jhande ko lekar bada bayaan saamne aayaa he
 Sangh's top official Bhaiyyaji Joshi has said that in fact 'vande Mataram' is the national anthem and it is not wrong to call the saffron flag a national flag
 haalanki ise baad sangh ne is ore spashtikaran bhi jari kiya
 Union spokesman Dr
 manmohan vaidya ne bhaiyaji joshi ke bayaan par spashtikaran jari karte hue kaha, 'sangh ke sarkaryavahak ne na to raashtra dhvaj main or na hi raashtragan main badlaav kii koi baat kii
 He simply explained the difference between state and nation
 bhaiyaji joshi ne yah kaha ki tirangaa ko bhartiya ganatantri main rashtradhvaj kaa darja praapt he, jabaki fagava jhanda desh kii prachin sabhyataa kaa parichaayak he
 He further said that Jana Gana Mana is indicative of the idea of the state, while Vande Mataram is the identity of our civilization
 vaastavik arthon main 'vande maataram' he raashtragan: bhaiyaji joshisang ke sarkaryavahabhaiyaji joshine kaha, 'maujuuda daur main jan gana man hamaara raashtragan he
 It should be respected
 isse duusari bhaavana paidaa hone kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 He said at Deendayal Upadhyay Research Institute on Friday that according to the constitution this is our national anthem
 agar koi vaastavik arthon par vichaar karata he to vande maataram hamaara raashtragan he
 Both songs should be respected equally when said 'jana Gana Mana'? It was written some time ago but 'jana Gana Mana' expresses feelings keeping the nation in mind
 unhone kaha ki haalanki 'vande maataram' main jaahir kii gai bhavanaayenrashtra kii visheshtaor banaavat ko rekhaankit karti hai
 The difference between the two songs is
 donon kaa sammaan kiya janaa chahie
 'treating the saffron flag as national flag is not an insult to the tricolor' Bhaiyaji Joshi further said that the tricolor is the national flag of the country, but it is not wrong to call the saffron flag also a national flag
 unhone kaha, '1930 me tirangaa paidaa hua, lekin kya uske pehle bharat kii pahchaan denevaala koi dhvaj nahin tha? samvidhan dwaara use pratik ke rup main laayaa gaya, jo samvidhan ke prati daayitv maanata he usne jan gana man or tirange kaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 But in the concept of nation, to consider the Bhagwad flag as national flag is not an insult to today's tricolor
