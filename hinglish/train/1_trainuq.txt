punjab main ek ke baad chunavi ghoshnaaon ke elaan karne kaa silsilaa shuru ho chukaa he
 But what about the promises that the Aam Aadmi Party made to the Delhiites? Arvind Kejriwal is talking about sitting the pegs in Punjab, but the ground of many big election promises seems to be slipping in Delhi
 aaie aapako bataate hai dilli menkejarivalsarkaar ke 10 bade vaade
 
 
 How many, how many incomplete
 
 
 1
 Free wi-fi: The promise of providing full free wi-fi internetstates: In June 2016, 13 months after coming to power, the Kejriwal government put forward a plan for free wi-fi network in the city
 is plan ke tahat purvi dilli main 3 hajaar hot spot point se free internet dene kaa blue print taiyaar hua
 In the rest of Delhi, the fiber network was described as lacking
 lekin dilliwaalon ke liye ab tak free vaai-faai internet ek sapana hi bana hua he
 2
 mohalla clinics: puri dilli main disambar 2016 tak 1 hajaar sthaayee mohalla clinics kholane kaa vadastatos:praathmik upachaar, chuninda test or free dawaaiyon vaala ek centre hamohalla clinics
 So far, the government has been able to open only 3 permanent mohalla clinics while more than 100 clinics are being run from rented rooms
 swasthya mantri or mukhyamantri kejariwal manch se iskaa jamkar prachaar karte hai lekin disambar 2016 tak sthaayee mohalla clinics kaise taiyaar honge, ye bada sawaal he
 3
 aam aadmi canteen: 10 rupee main sasta bhojan dilaane kaa vadastatos:kejariwal sarkaar ke tatkaaleen dilli dialog kamishan ne ammaa canteen kii tarj par aam aadmi canteen kholane kaa elaan kiya tha
 But this promise is also confined in the files
 puraa ek saal guzarane ke baad bhi is tarah kii kisi canteen kii aadhikarik ghoshnaa sarkaar ne nahin kii he
 4
 drug free dilli: aam aadmi party ne dilli ko nasha mukt banane kaa vaada kiya thastatos:nasha mukt kii bajaay pichley dedh saal main sarkaar ne sharaab ke theke kaa license dene kaa record tod diya he
 About 399 licenses were awarded for liquor contracts, including new ones
 is dauraan virodhiyon ne sawaal uthaae ki sharaab kii dukaan kaa license dene se pehle na mohalla sabha bulaai gai, na ilaake kii mahilaon se raay lee
 Right now the talk of drug free Delhi seems to be flying in the air
 5
 Delhi equipped with CCTV: Promised to install CCTV in congested areas and DTC buses: Promises to install CCTV to make public feel safe in public place, but apart from installing CCTV in a few DTC buses, the government is complete No plan has been put before the public to spread CCTV network in the city
 6
 Respect to sanitation workers: promise to stop contractual practice, give mask to sanitary workers cleaning inside sewer, compensation of 50 lakhs on death and medical insurance: Kejriwal government quarrel with Municipal Corporation after Delhi comes to power Is not hidden
 fund na dene kii vajah se pichley dedh saal main kai baar dilli kooday kaa dher bani
 But as per the election promise, so far the government has not announced any medical insurance to the sanitation workers, masks for cleaning the sewer and compensation of Rs 50 lakh on the death of the employee
 7
 Women's Protection Force: The promise of creating a Women's Protection Force for the protection of women: The appointment of 10 thousand women home guards has not been done yet
 na hi sarkaar ditisi bason main puri tarah mahila marshall tainaat kar pai he
 The Kejriwal government continues to taunt the Modi government over the issue of women safety
 chunavi vaada ab raajnneetik ladaai ban chukaa he
 8
 mobile suraksha batan: mahilaon ke liye mobile par suraksha batan, jise mobile aplicoshan kii shakl main dene kaa vadastatos:ek aisi takanic jisamen batan ko dabaate hi ek alert najdiki pisiar vine yaa police stesan tak pahunche
 But in the last year and a half, the government has not officially disclosed any such security button
 wo do bade vaade, jo kejariwal sarkaar ne puure kiye, lekin lagu karne main kuch samasyaayein
 
 
 1
 free pani: dilli waalon ko har maheene 20 hajaar litre pani kaa vadastatos:20 hajaar litre pani se agar 1 litre pani zyada ho jaae to logon ko puraa bill bharna padataa he
 Also, in the unregulated colonies of Delhi, not only water meters, free water has just become a dream
 garmi main pani kaa production kam hone se kai ilaakon main pani kii supplai bhi kam ho jaati he
 In such a situation, 700 liters of water a day is not available to the people
 2
 Half the electricity bill waived: Electricity bill half till the use of 400 units and the promise of cheaper electricity
 Statements: If Delhiites spend more than 400 units of electricity, then the entire bill has to be filled and this scheme is no longer useful
 garmi ke dinon main iskaa phayda uthaanaa ek sapane kii tarah he
 Currently, subsidies are being used from the state exchequer in the name of half-waiving the electricity bills and private companies are charging full money

 On the other hand, amid the "namo Mantra" going on in national politics, he is also eyeing Muslims

 18 april ko lakhanu main bispi kii brahman bhaichara samiti kii baithak main yahi baangi dekhne ko mili
 The Dalit leader directly laid his hand on the traumatized blood of the Brahmins and recently introduced the incident of a Brahmin family in Etawah putting garlands of shoes around their neck as a hallmark of upper caste oppression across the state
 sammelan main ‘‘brahman shankh bajaaega, hathi dilli jayega’’, ‘‘hathi nahin ganesh he, brahman vishnu mahesh he’’ jaise chah saal puraane naaron kii gunj sunai di
 a national general secretary of the BSP says that Mayawati plans to win at least 20 of the 36 Lok Sabha seats with reserved seats and Brahmin majority, only then can the party win more than 40 of the 80 seats in UP
 in 36 loksabhaa siton par sabase pehle ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kii he
 It consists of 19 Brahmins and the rest 17 Dalits
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bispi ne 20 brahmanon ko loksabhaa chunaav kaa tikat diya tha, jisamen paanch vijayi rahe the
 In the 2007 assembly elections, for the first time a Brahmin voter was seen standing in the bsp's court
 is chunaav main party ke 86 brahmanon main se 43 vijayi rahe the
 Not only this, 59 out of 89 reserved assembly seats went to BSP

 Mayawati said in the conference, "brahmin society had moved away from the BSP after being seduced by the opposing party, but now it is also suffering from the tyranny of the SP government of the state
" ’’sammelan main mili kamyaabi se utsahit mayawati agle din 19 april ko rajyapal bi

 K
 choudhary kii party main vaapasi karai
 In 2001, Mayawati expelled Chaudhary from the BSP on charges of indiscipline and 12 years later, on 23 April this year, Chaudhary merged his "national self-esteem Party" into BSP
 daliton main paasi birdari main khaasi paith rakhane vaale choudhary kii ahmiyat kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki varsh 1993 main vidhansabha chunaav ke thik pehle kanshiram ne unhen party kaa ‘state koardinatery banaakar pradesh adhyaksh ke baraabar darja diya tha
 Apart from Chaudhary, Rakeshdhar Tripathi has also returned to the party
 treepathi mayawati kii pichhali sarkaar main ucch shiksha mantri the or lokayukta jaanch main bhrashtachar ke doshi paae jane ke baad unase kursi or party kii sadsyta donon hi chhin gaye the
 But on January 24 this year, he secretly returned not only to the BSP but also got a ticket from Mirzapur Lok Sabha constituency
 isi tarah mayawati sarkaar main alpsankhyak kalyaan mantri rahe anis ahamed urf phool babu ko lokayukta jaanch main vidhayak nidhi ke durupyog karne kaa doshi paae jane ke baad bispi se nikaala gaya tha lekin ve bhi ab party main waapas aa chuke hai
 He can be made a BSP candidate from Pilibhit Lok Sabha constituency
 purv congress pradesh adhyaksh reeta bahuguna joshi ke lakhanu sthit awaas ko jalaane ke aaropee bikapur (faijabad) se purv vidhayak jitendra kumaar singh urf bablu kaa tikat kaat diya gaya tha
 Angered Bablu then contested the assembly elections on a Peace Party ticket but lost
 mayawati ko jab faijabad loksabhaa kshetra se koi majboot pratyaashee nahin mila to unhone bablu ko hi is seat se bispi kaa tikat thama diya
 On the return of these leaders, the party's leader, the Legislature Party and state spokesperson Swami Prasad Maurya, says, "there are many situations when the workers come under the purview of disciplinary action
" bhul sudhaar ke baad unki vaapasi kaa rasta khulaa rahata he
 It is a continuous process
 ’’mayawati dalit jatiyon ke aapasi ganit ko bhi saadhane main lagi hai

 The BSP has fielded Jatav fraternity candidates in all 10 reserved seats in western UP, Pasi in six seats in central and eastern UP and Kashyap fraternity in one seat
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bispi keval lalganj or mishrikh surakshit seat hi jeet saki thi
 "unnao, Sitapur, Mohanlalganj, Rae Bareli, Faizabad, Kaushambi, Phulpur, Hardoi, Misrikh, Barabanki, Amethi are the Lok Sabha seats where Pasi voters constitute 8 to 12 per cent of the total electorate
 is lihaaj se in siton par paasi birdari nirnaayak sabit ho sakati he
 "this exercise of the BSP going on before the elections reminds us of the old days of Congress Raj in the state
" tab kii congress dalit-brahman-muslim ke gathjod par chalakar satta par kabiz rahi
 Now Mayawati is bringing back the same old formula of Congress by sweeping it
 fark bas itnaa he ki congressraj main congressi dalit ko bagal kii kursi par bithaate the, vahiin mayaraj main dalit brahman ko neeche kii kursi par bithaate hai

 Dhoni, who faced criticism for slow batting in the first ODI in Sydney, led the team to victories in Adelaide and Melbourne
 australia main mili aitihaasik jeet main dhoni ke yogadan kaa ullekh karte hue kohli ne kaha ki purv captain ko kuch raahat di jaani chahie
 He said, 'as a team we are very happy for Dhoni
 unhone ran banaae jo lay or aatmavishvaas phir paane ke liye jaruri he
 Especially when you are not playing too much international cricket
 ’kohli ne kaha, ‘baahar bahut kuch hota he
 People say a lot, but we know that there is no one more dedicated to Indian cricket than Dhoni

 com / pkd5q7nqql— BCCI (@BCCI) January 18, 2019 Indian captain Virat Kohli said that there is a need to strengthen the number four in the batting order, while till a few months ago, he will give Ambati Rayudu for this year's World Cup
 Were telling you kohli ne kaha ki chauthe number par kaaphi prayog ho chuke hai
 The batting order in Adelaide was the norm with Rayudu landing at number four, but he would keep experimenting in team combinations until someone takes responsibility at number four
 kohli ne australia par vanade siries main mili jeet ke baad kaha, ‘pichhlaa match dekhen to ambati raidu chauthe number par utraa, dhoni paanchaven or dinesh karthik chathe number par kyonki hamane vijay shankar or kedaar jadhav ko utaara
 We do not want to replace Karthik as he is playing well
 ’kohli ne westeindies ke khilaaf pichley saal gharelu siries main raidu ko chauthe number par utaarne kii pairvi kii thi
 He said, 'there was no problem in the middle overs in Adelaide and the order looked quite balanced, but we need to strengthen the number four
 jo bhi is number par utrega, use vishwa cap tak jimmedaari leni hogi
 Regarding captaincy, he said that if the team is good, then the captain is also good
 unhone kaha, ‘captaini vyaktigat niyantran kii baat nahin he
 If the team is good then the captain is also good
 maine test siries ke baad bhi yah kaha tha, shrey har kisi ko jaataa he kyonki sabhi ne isamen yogadan diya he
 We are leaving Australia without losing and it was a memorable tour for us

 ' 2019 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle ek or rajya congress ke haath se jaataa dikhaai de rahaa he
 The BJP is heading for a majority in the Karnataka elections with a lead of 113 seats
 vahiin congress kii badhat 68 siton tak rah gai he
 Let us tell you that the mandate of Karnataka is very important for the country's oldest party Congress
 punjab ke baad karnataka desh main congress kaa doosraa sabase bada garh bachaa hua tha
 If the Congress wins here, then the Congress Party and Rahul Gandhi will be able to stake their claim strongly for the 2019 elections
 karnataka main jeet yaa haar se congress ke liye kya sthitiyaan utpann hongi
 In such a situation, the Congress's fall in the initial trends has become a problem for Rahul Gandhi
 padhein
 Congress trends are running behind the election trends, know how the defeat of the Congress will make it difficult for the party to 2019: 1
 ek bada siyaasi durg haath se nikalegacongress agar karnataka kaa chunaav haar jaati he to isse uskaa ek bada siyaasi durg chhin jayega
 After this, only the big fort of Punjab will be left with the Congress
 2019 se pehle party ke liye ye bada jhatka sabit ho saktaa he
 Therefore, it is very important for the Congress to win the Karnataka elections
 2
 Before 2019, the brand Rahul will suffer a big setback, the results of Karnataka are very important for the Congress strategy of brand Rahul to stand out against Brand Modi
 chunaav main haar se vipaksh main foot kii sambhaavna bad jaaegi
 The Third Front will intensify and this will directly benefit the BJP
 3
 Karnataka model will prove to be a failure
 If Karnataka comes out of the hands of Congress, then the Karnataka model of Congress will prove to be weaker than Modi's Gujarat model
 congress karnataka main pichley 5 saal se satta main thi
 The party publicized the claims and policies of the work there
 yahaan tak ki party ke ranneetikaar gujarat model ke saamne apane karnataka model kii charchaa lagaataar kar rahe the
 While the bjp's stake was more on Modi magic than Yeddyurappa, the Congress was more dependent on Siddaramaiah card than central leaders
 saath hi rahul gandhi ke soft hindutv kii ek or prayogshaala bhi karnataka bana
 If this experiment is not successful, then the difficulties will increase in front of the party
 4
 The situation will be weakened in the talks about the alliance, the Congress will lose the position in talks with its allies for 2019, if they lose the Karnataka elections
 vaise bhi sapa, basapa, trinmul congress, ensipi, diemke, argedy ye sab aise dal hai, jinaki apane-apane rajyon main jabardast pakad he
 The loss of Karnataka will reduce the bargaining capacity of the Congress
 5
 Brand Modi's challenge will be increased in South India too, BJP is holding power in most of the Hindi speaking states on the basis of modi magic, but in non-hindi speaking states, Congress's position is still strong
 2014 ke chunaav main jab congress 44 siton par simat gai thi, tab bhi congress ko 33 siten dakshin bharat or baaki gaiyr hindi bhashi rajyon se hi mili thim
 The loss of Congress in Karnataka will open new doors of possibilities for the BJP in the southern states

 It is being suggested by the government to either abolish the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) completely or declare a big cut by 31 March 2017 to implement the debit card rebate
 
 kya he emdiar or kyon jaruri hamerchent discount rate vah dar he jo bank kisi bhi dukandaar se card pement seva ke liye vasuulati he
 The Reserve Bank believes that it is not possible for banks to take this step
 is faisle ko liya jaataa he to zyaadaatar bainkon ko kaarobaar karnaa sirf ghate kaa sauda rah jayega

 maujuuda samay main sabhi bainkon kaa milakar kul 15 lakh pioes termilan kaam kar rahaa he
 If they are forced to give discounts on card payments, then it will have a direct impact on setting up new terminals in the country
 lihaaja yah faisla cashles iconomi kii disha main badhane main sirf baadha hi sabit hoga

 jiesti lagu hone ke baad se bhartiya sena ko dikkat kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 This is the reason why the army has asked the Indian government to keep them out of the Goods and Services Tax (GST)
 sena ke ek ucch adhikari ne pahchaan jaahir nahin karne kii shart par bataaya ki sena ne sarkaar se isko lekar apil de di he or is mudde ko badi gambhirtha se uthaaya he
 According to the new rules of tax2
 5 lakh se upar kii har khariddaari par GST lagane kaa praavdhaan he
 According to army sources, the units of the Indian Army are constantly making changes in their bases
 bhartiya senake sutron ke anusaar aise main use GST ke liye har baar alag se register karwaanaa padataa he kyonki vah rajya aadhaarit he
 Army source said that in such a situation, there can be no local purchase every time a new registration is done
 sena badalte rahati he lokeshnasutra ke anusaar bhartiya sena ke unit har do saal or kabhi-kabhi har saal apane thikaanon main badlaav karti he
 Also, due to operational reasons, many units are deployed in the border of the states and not in the capital

 yah saal 2012 main relies hui donon kii pichhali film ‘ek tha tiger’ kaa sikval he
 a few days ago there were reports that Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif may give their relationship a second chance
 cricket kaa dharm, nasl, jati yaa rashtrawaad se kya rishta he? kya varg bhed ke najariye se bhi is khel ko dekha janaa chahie? is desh main jahaan cricketron kii puja kii jaati he, is khel ke samajashaastra kaa adhyayan bhi kiya janaa chahie
 One such attempt has been made by the famous historian and writer Ramachandra Guha
 unhone apni nai kitaab 'videshi khel apane maidan par' main bhartiya cricket main nasl, dharm, jati or rashtrawaad ke asar ko aankane kii koshish kii he
 Also talked about the anonymous cricketers of Indian cricket history in detail
 is kitaab ke kuch ansh ham khaas aapke liye yahaan rakh rahe hai:cricket or sampradayikta: ramchandra guhaabombai kaa vaarshik cricket utsav, yuddh kii prishthbhumi liye khel, dharm or raajnneeti kaa sammishran tha
 Its existence was a bizarre paradox — a staunch communal competition that prevailed in the most progressive and metropolitan city of modern India
 koi bhi ab unki gahari bhaavana ko samaj saktaa tha jinhone kadavaahat se iskaa virodh kiya tha
 For Indian nationalists, the mere acceptance of a communal identity on the cricket ground for Barelvi or Taleyarkhan dissolved the idea of shared citizenship, which meant that 'we are all Indians before anything else happens'
 ’ panchakoniya cricket pratiyogita ke astitv ne samaveshi rashtrawaad ko angootha dikhaa diya jiskaa mahatma gandhi, jawaharlal nehru jaise logon ne samarthan kiya tha, or jati-dharm ke vibhaajanon ko badhaava diya
 First it was debated that the beginning of the competition was for the British divide and rule policy and the second argument was that the continuation of it promoted Pakistan's illegitimate but dangerously fashionable demand
 prashaskon ne jaanboojhkar sampradayik aadhaar par khel ke sanghathan ko protsaahit kiya tha aisa vistrut rup se mana jaataa tha
 An American journalist visiting India on the eve of independence wrote that the British divide and rule policy had reached the schools as well - the Hindu team in the game was fighting the Muslim team and with graduation it was a competition for jobs
 Used to become a competition for swatantraaa ke fouran baad likhe apane ek lekh main puna ke jane maane cricketer dibi devdhar ne daawa kiya kibharat ke ucchtam cricket main sampradayikta kii bhaavana sirf british afasaron kii hi vajah se ai kyonki shuruaati dinon main ye log bharatiyon se nipatate samay khud ko shreshthata kii bhaavana se bhare rahete the
 All the British officers who came to protect the British Empire in India were told by the higher authorities that they should have very little contact with the indigenous people
 isliye angrezon ne bombai, kalakatta or madras ke teen prantiy shaharon main khaas club bana liye
 Later clubs were established in other cities like Poona Dekhi Poona and Bangalore
 parsi logon ne bhi is khel ko chunaa or unhone khel ke saath saath angrezon kii pruthakatavaadi pravriti ko bhi le liya
 On one side, the British did not allow the Zoroastrians to enter their holy forts
 isliye parsiyon ne vivashtaapurvak alag club bana liya
 But in those clubs they could allow other Indians
 durbhagyavash yah kiya nahin gaya
 As a result, Hindus too had to follow the same path
 or aakhir main musalmaan bhi yahi rasta apaanne ko baadhya the
 The racism of colonial clubs was palpable
 parantu yah uddhran yah bhi sujhata he ki hindu sampradayik cricket main khud shaamil hone ke icchhuk hone kii bajaae peedit vyakti the
 Whereas it seemed to be a retrospective thought that had the influence of inclusive nationalism encouraged by Gandhi and his ilk since 1920
 yadi britani alag the to isi prakaar hindu samaaj bhi apane dharmik daayaron ke chalate jatiyon or up jatiyon ke bich banta hua tha
 In fact, cricket clubs in India had organized themselves on the basis of caste in the late 19th century
 shaskaon ne shaayad sochaa hoga ki chatushkoniya cricket pratiyogita kaa swaroop bharat ke liye swaabhaavik hoga lekin ve ise bina sahaayta ke astitv main nahin lekar aa rahe the
 As much as Hindu caste prejudices in communal cricket were as much as social pride of Zoroastrians, cultural mental narrowness of Muslims and ethnic primacy of British
 yadi chatushkoniya pratiyogita ke janm ke mul main purnataya british sarkaar kii foot daalo raaj karo kii niti na bhi rahi ho to isaki nirantarata ke bare main kya? kya 1930 or 1940 main pratiyogita kii bad rahi lokapriyata ne pakistan ke andolan ke liye chaare kaa kaam nahin kiya? or adhik sateek rup se kya sampradayik cricket ne sampradayik vairabhav ko poshit or gaharaa nahin kiya? khilaadiyon ke anusaar nahi
 Two Sindh players, one of whom was a Hindu and an Englishman, said that one who thinks communal cricket gives rise to bad feelings should come to Karachi to see the sports rivalry and good friendship between the two players and spectators
 usne isamen joda ki ve bahut badali hui raay ke saath waapas jaaenge
 This was written on a cricket page in a newspaper in 1928, but about ten years later, a cricketer from Bombay, where the sports and political stakes were clearly high, said the same thing
 november 1940 main muslim captain saiyad vajeer ali ko yah kehete hue uddhat kiya gaya ki yah pratiyogita thodi bhi rashtravirohi nahin he or ise bhartiya cricket ke hiton main jaruri or aavashyak rup se jari rahanaa chahie
 The next year, when the fate of this cricket tournament hung in the balance, Hindu captain CK Naidu claimed that the competition did not promote communal discrimination in any way
 isane swasth pratispardhaa or sampradayik ekta ko badhaava diya he
 It has merged communities rather than dividing them
 sike ke ek or saathi mushtak ali ke mutabik mahotsav ne hameshaa khilaadiyon or janata ke bich pratispardhaa kii ek swasth bhaavana or khel bhaavana ko protsaahan diya he
 According to his experience - the wave and noise of applause from all sides of the stand has welcomed good performances without discrimination
 beshak yah naidu (ek hindu) ke chhakkon ke liye ho, nisaar (ek muslim) kii wicket ukhaadti gendon ke liye ho yaa phir bhaayaa (ek parsi) ke chatur kshetrarakshan ke liye
 There was a glimpse of truth in the statements of the cricketers but was it really the issue? Did the sporting encounters between Hindus and Muslims increase their appreciation of each other's skills and achievements, or did they trigger a more dangerous war elsewhere? Here the debate on this subject has been going on for a long time and so far it has not reached any conclusion
 udhaaharan ke taur par jorge orvel jaise log is antarrashtriya khel ko golabari rahit yuddh ke rup main pesh karte hai
 In November 1938, when the controversy of the five-cornered contest was at its peak, another English writer presented it as such
 alds huxley ne tippanee kii ki ashaavadi siddhantkaar khel ko rashtron ke bich rishton ke rup main maanate hai
 In the current state of nationalist sentiment, this is just one more reason for creating international misunderstanding
 footbal maidan par or res-trek par hone vaali jhadpen mahaj shuruaati hoti hai or pratiyogita kii adhik taiyaari main sahyog karti hai
 This sense of consensus among British novelists carries forward Alan Silito, who thinks that sports are a means of keeping the national spirit alive even in times of peace
 yah yuddh kii sambhavit ghatana ke liye rashtriya bhaavana ko taiyaar karata he

 But the participation of the participating teams was ignored by the elections in March
 pratidin bad rahe chunaavon ke bukhaar ke falswaroop teji se badtar ho rahe sampradayik halaat ke chalate pratiyogita antim kshanon main radd kar di gai
 The Muslim League did well in Punjab when elections were held
 punjab ek aisa praant tha jis par lig kii najar thi, lekin yah vahaan kuch khaas nahin kar pai thi
 Similarly, in other states, the league won most of the seats reserved for Muslims
 march or june 1946ke bich teen sadasyon ke ek cabinet mishan ne bharat kaa daura kiya taaki swatantraaa kii sharton par samjhauta ho sake

 Meanwhile, the Viceroy offered a mixed interim government of the congress-league under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru

 The electoral success gave Jinnah the courage to raise her voice
 apni puri jindagi vah ek samvidhanvid rahe the jo ki apane mudde par vidhansabha, kachhari or press main bahes karne ko taiyaar the
 Now he appealed for Direct Action Day
 unhone apane anuyaayiyon se saarvajanik sabhaayen, march or hadataalen karne ko kaha
 It was an open invitation to violence
 jinna ke tayshuda din yani 16agast ko puure bharat main dange bhadak gaye
 The worst affected city was Calcutta in which 4000 people died in the riots
 1946kii garmiyon main jabaki desh main sampradayik maahaul garmaya hua tha, tab ek bhartiya cricket team england kaa daura kar rahi thi
 Its captain was the Nawab of Pataudi and its members included Hindus, Muslims and Christians
 yah team test maichon main haraa di gai parantu isane kanutiyon ke khilaaf khud ko bade prashansaneey rup se khud kiya
 Some of its cricketers proved themselves to be world class
 vijay marchent ne sundar dhang se ballebaaji karte hue daure par 2000se adhik ran banaae or vinu mankad ne 1000ranon or 100viketon ke saath ol rounder kii dohari bhoomika adaa kii
 From there on the eve of farewell to India, the cricketers received two mutually contradictory messages of farewell
 shriman stefford krips ek samaajawaadee or vyapaar ke board ke pradhan the
 Stafford Cripps was hopeful for independent India
 unhone vishwaas vyakt kiya ki daure par banaai gai dosti un do deshon ke bich achche sambandh banaaegi jisaki ham ummid karte hai or jiske liye ham aage kii soch rakhte hai
 Former President of MCC, Mr
 Pahalam Warner in his message drew attention to the sources that tied India to the empire
 unhone cricketron kii unke mohak bartaav ke liye prashansa kii or phir kaha ki abhi hue yuddh ke dauraan aapke sainikon kii shandaar bahaduree ko england nahin bhuulaa he or sambhawatah vah bhul bhi nahin paae
 Now the question was, will it be five-cornered in 1946? In the first week of September, bcci's newly elected head AS Dimelo gave a speech in Bombay
 is bhaashan main ve hamaare rashtriya jivan par cricket ke ekikaran ke prabhaavon par bole ki kaise khel alag-alag samudaayon ko swasth vivadrahit or manoranjak str par ek saath laa rahaa he
 This was the support of the Panchkonya, which was not even hidden and indeed this loyal supporter of The Rest was seeking opinion from the kings to send their players to the festival
 jesi maitra ne board adhyaksh ko fatkaaraa ki desh main bad rahe sampradayik tanaav se unhen koi matlab nahin he
 He intuitively suggests that communal rivalry on the playground is the best way to encourage communal harmony
 parantu sitambar ke aakhri hafte me board baroda main mila to dimelo ab vah insaan nahin rahaa tha
 His idea of a five-cornered went through a sudden change
 kalakatta kaa vibhats jansanhaar abhi bhi uske dimag main taaja tha
 He had now agreed that in the current mood of the country, it is the duty of the board to carefully consider the rationale for conducting the five-cornered contest this year and in the future
 do maheene baad isaki agali meeting main board ne ek prastaav paas kiya jiske tahat usne kaha ki ‘vah sampradayik cricket ko manyata nahin detaur yadi sisiai is baat par raji hota he ki vah kisi bhi sampradayik pratiyogita ko nahin karavaayega to board sisiai ko jonal pratiyogita kaa sanchaalan karne kaa adhikaar adhyaksh or sisiai ke bich sharton or niyamon par paraspar sahmati ke aadhaar par saunp kar prasann hoga
 'eventually the pub (competition) was to be closed
 phir bhi yah kaaphi samay se khulaa tha
 Pakistan was set to be built by the end of 1946 and (this cricket) festival was a cause of trouble for all except its staunch supporters
 un sardiyon main panchakoniya kii jagah breabourne stadium ne jonal pratiyogita kii mejabani kii, yah jesi maitra dwaara sampradayik cricket ke badale main gaiyr-sampradayik vikalp ke liye chalaae gaye do varshon ke abhiyaan kii paraakaashtha thi
 In the Western Zone, Muslim Ibrahim and Christian Hazare, Parsi Modi and Hindu Mankad, officials and tearing were playing together, similarly the Northern Zone was also universal
 final main pashchimi or uttari jone aamane-saamne thi
 Eleven players from the North Zone included Hindu Amarnath and Kishanchand, Parsi Irani and half a dozen Muslim cricketers
 cricket or cricketron kii gunvattta ucch str kii thi parantu bheed kii pratikriya udasin thi, kyonki kuch hajaar prashansak hi match dekhne ke liye aae the
 Hartley wrote a review of this in the Times of India - the suspension of the nearly 50-year-long Bombay Cricket Festival would have a bad effect
 ’unhone joda ki panchakoniya pratiyogita kii anupasthiti khiladiyon or darshakon ke bich samaan rup se khel main ruchi ko khatm kar rahi he
 Jesse Maitra in the Chronicle expressed anger over its implication that Bombay has no love or interest for cricket and only wants to demonstrate communalism in the name of cricket
 unhone jor diya ki bombai kaa apane pasandida khel ke liye pyaar kahin zyada or usase zyada gaharaa he
 Then why is the crowd so low? Maitra said that due to the current political situation filled with excitement, there was uncertainty of future in every sphere of life with a high tension between Hindus and Muslims
 prashansakon kaa khel main dhyaan nahin he jo kai dinon tak ek saath ghanton kii upasthiti kii maang karata he
 By the end, these two newspapers in Bombay were going to fight over what the game of cricket meant to the people of the city

 Questions have been raised about Kapil Mishra, the minister in the Delhi government, organizing the Mohalla Sabha in his constituency
 mishra ne elaan kiya he ki wo 28 agast ko karaval nagar vidhansabha ke khajuri main mohalla sabha ke jariye ye jaanane kii koshish karenge ki sharaab kii dukaan se logon ko koi pareshaani he yaa nahin, use band kara dena chahie yaa nahin
 But the question arises whether the Kejriwal government has taken permission from the Lieutenant Governor on the decision-making policy of the meeting? When the question was asked on the Mohalla Sabha, Minister Surendra Jain said that about 3 thousand 500 Mohalla Sabha are being formed inside Delhi
 
 mohalla sabha ke saare niyam banaae ja chuke hai or boundry tay kii ja chuki hai
 But this can cause a lot of trouble to the leaders because they will not understand going to the power people
 kai netaa iske khilaaf hai
 First people go to join hands
 jab janata vot detii he to netaa raja ban jate hai
 The question of permission from the Lieutenant Governor on the decision-making policy of the House may raise the concern of Delhi Government but Sathendra Jain is justifying the Mohalla Sabha and the decisions taken in it
 unhone kaha ki 'mohalla sabha pichhali baar bhi kii gai thi or loktantr ke andar jo kanoonee amalijama pehanaanaa he, wo hota rahegaa
 There is no problem in meeting the Mohalla
 'AAP ne kiya tha chunaav main vaadaam aadmi party sarkaar ne chunaav se pehle vaada kiya tha ki wo aisi niti laaegi, jahaan janata hi sarkari fund or apane mohalle main hone vaale kaamkaaj kaa faisla kar sakegi
 Satendra Jain says that 'gandhiji said that democracy cannot run in Delhi or at the center
 loktantr wo hota he jo gaanv yaa chote se kasbe yaa chote shahar ke log milakar karen
 Our country was liberated in 1947 but it will take time to establish democracy
 loktantr ke andar janata kii asli takat vot kii he, vahi vot dekar netaa banaate hai or netaa maalik banakar baith jate hai
 It needs to end
 'janata kii marji se sharaab kii nai dukaan khulegi: jainphilhal virdohi kejariwal sarkaar kii mohalla sabha aursharab niteeper sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 In response, Satendra Jain is talking about giving the Mohalla Sabha the power to decide
 jain ne kaha, 'sharaab ke maamle main puri takat mohalla sabha ko di gai he
 Now the liquor shop will be closed or the new shop will open as per the wishes of the public
 sarkaar ne ye faisla kiya sharaab kii dukaan ke najadik dekharekh kii jimmedaari dukandaar kii hogi

 It was natural to stir up the girl's actions
 gujarati filmon main acting or modelling karne vaali ladki ne apane maujuuda halaat se tang aakar aisa kadam uthaaya
 This girl wrote on Facebook that she wants to sell and if there is a buyer, she will have to help her family
 jab model se poocha gaya ki usne aisa kadam kyon uthaaya to usne kaha, main jab bhi kisi se madad maangane jaati thi to log mere jism ke bare main hi poochhate the
 So i put my respect for money at stake

 Finding a producer for 'yamla Pagla Deewana' was a challenging experience for actor Sunny Deol, as their pairing with Bobby Deol and father Dharmendra was not considered profitable by the market
 abhinayta sanni deol ne bataaya, ‘meraa maananaa tha ki film industry main 50 varsh puraa karne vaale mere pita ek behtareen film ke hakdaar hai, isliye mujhe isaki parvaah nahin ki bazaar main kya chalata he
 'sunny said that later on this, i and film director Sameer Karnik decided to do something
 jiske baad nitin manmohan bhi bataur nirmaataa isse jud gaye
 Sunny says that it took him a year and a half to prepare the script for the film
 sanni ne bataaya, ‘shuruaati yojana ke mutabik ham ek aisi film bananaa chaahate the, jisamen main or bobi saath-saath rahun
 After working on the script of this film, it seemed that the story of father and son could also be in it
 jiske baad patakatha par phir se kaam kiya gaya
 Sunny says that the promo of the film 'yamla Pagla Deewana' has got a very positive message

 During the hearing of a Manipur case, Justice Lokur asked the AG how many recommendations of the Collegium are currently pending for appointment of judges in the High Courts? The Attorney General said, "I will have to gather information
" justise lokur ne kaha ki sarkaar ke saath yahi dikkat he
 On the spot, the government says that information has to be taken
 is par atorni general ne kaha ki colegium ko badi tasviir dekhni chahie
 Recommendation of more names should be sent
 kai ucch nyaayalayon main 40 jajon ke pad khaali hai lekin colegium sirf 3-4 naam bhejtaa he or phir kaha jaataa he ki sarkaar kuch nahin kar rahi he
 Venugopal said, "if there is no recommendation of the collegium, nothing can be done
" tab court ne sarkaar ko yaad dilaayaa ki unhen niyuktiyaan kerani hi hongi
 In fact, the Collegium had on April 19 recommended the names of Justice M
 Yakub Mir for Chief Justice of Meghalaya High Court and Justice Ramalingam Sudhakar for Chief Justice of Manipur High Court

 The public has high expectations from the government, we will have to work at the same pace
 lekin kai baar sanghathanon (vichaar parivaar) kii ore se hi aisi bayaanbaji ho jaati he jisase aapasi samaj prabhavit ho jaati he
 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the closing session of the three-day coordination meeting of the Sangh Parivar, expressed his sentiments in this manner for about a quarter of an hour, he clearly indicated the land acquisition ordinance, labor reforms, FDI in retail, GM
 There was an initial opposition to the Sangh's affiliates on issues such as crop
 ise vipakshi dalon ne rajnatik hathiyaar banaaya or bhoomi adhyadesh par sarkaar ke khilaaf bani nakaaratmak chhavi kii vajah se use kadam waapas khinchne ko majaboor hona padaa
 But 15 months later, in the presence of Prime Minister Modi, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat agreed with his sentiment
 teen din tak sabhi ke vichaar sunne ke baad bhagwat ne sabase aakhir main mahaj 30 minute main samanvay kaa nichod kuch is tarah se thamaya, “sangh ke jitne bhi sanghathan hai, ham sab milakar ek vichaar parivaar hai or sabhi ke vichaaron kaa isi prakaar se aadan-pradaan hote rahanaa chahie
 This benefits both the government and the people on both sides of the organization
 hamen mil-julkar is prakriya ko aage badhanaa chahie
 "the Sangh Parivar no longer wants to repeat the mistake that took place during the reign of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 samanvay ke abhaav kaa nateeja sadakon par dikhne laga tha
 But this time, before the Sangh formed the BJP government at the Center, the family met and prepared a draft policy on six subjects, which was called the family's own thinking
 lekin pehle saal main samanvay nahin hone se kai aise maukey aae jab sangh ke aanushanbik sanghathanon ne saarvajanik taur se vichaardhaara se jude muddon par sarkaar par hamalaa karne main gurej nahin kiya
 This raised questions on the government's credibility in the first year itself
 lihaaja sangh ne anaupchaarik taur se aanushanbik sanghathanon ko sanyam baratane kii salaah di thi
 BJP also started the process of consultation with family organizations like Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, Swadeshi Jagran Manch at the organization level and also connected ministers from the government to interact with these organizations according to the topic i went
 lekin in prayaason ke baavjood sangh apni bhoomika mahaj mookadarshak kii nahin rakhana chahta tha, isliye routine main hone vaali samanvay baithak ko vistaarit rup diya gaya
 When all the organizations gathered in the presence of the Sangh chief, along with expressing concern over the functioning of the government, suggestions were also given
 baithak ke baad sangh ke sahasarkaarywah dattatreya hosbale ne ise sarkaar kii samiksha baithak maanane se bhale inkaar kiya, par har satr main sarkaar kii ore se sambandhit mantri jawaab dene ke liye bulaae gaye the
 In fact, the Sangh wants the Modi government to move forward with a strong will because it will not be appropriate to wait now
 sutron ke mutabik, bhagwat ne is baat kaa khaas taur se zikr kiya ki vichaardhaara ko lekar sangh apni teen peedi khapa chukaa he
 The Sangh wants coordination for its ideology, but it is not fully satisfied with the government at the moment
 hosbale ne khud kaha, “sarkaar ke abhi 14 maheene hi hue hai
 Now is the time in which he has to do a lot of work
 disha thik he, uplabdhi acchhee he
 But the Modi government should work with the agenda of the mind of the people of the country, this is our wish
 ” haalanki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bhaiyyaji joshi ke udghaatan sambodhan ke fouran baad ek ghante tak sarkaar-sanghathan kii uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan kiya
 He made special mention of the contribution of the Sangh Parivar in the victory of the Lok Sabha elections
 shah ne kaha, “aaj ham jahaan (shashan main) hai usamen modi ji kii chhavi, congress kii galat nitiyaan to hai hi, lekin sabase badi baat yah he ki puraa parivaar hamaare peeche khadaa tha, isliye bijepi ko itani adbhut vijay mili
 However, in order to move forward on the Sangh's thinking, Modi also very cleverly tried to connect the volunteers with his ambitious plans
 sutron ke mutabik, modi ne kaha, “sangh charitra nirmaan or raashtra nirmaan kii sikh detaa he
 If the volunteers go ahead and play a role in schemes like Cleanliness Mission, Namami Gange, then they will definitely get success
 ” modi sarkaar kii ore se samanvay baithak main sangh ko yah bhi ishaara kar diya gaya ki ram mandir jaise mudde abhi sarkaar kii praathamikta main nahin honge
 But it has been agreed to carry out a special campaign to bring glory to other Hindu pilgrimage centers
 alpaahar ke dauraan “mukt chintan” main bhi sangh ke varisht netaaon or modi ke bich gahan charchaa hui
 Taking lessons from the past, the Sangh has played the role of a guardian
 bahumat se bani vichaardhaara vaali sarkaar or aanushanbik sanghathanon ke bich samanvay kaa sutarapaat ho gaya he
 But the cord of coordination is extremely thin

 When the results of the assembly elections in Chhattisgarh came, the Congress led by its state level leaders, bjp's star Chief Minister Dr
 raman singh ko pachhad diya
 In the most decisive mandate of the 18-year-old state so far, the Congress ousted the BJP from power and it did so without its leader of the party, Ajit Jogi
 to congress kii jeet kii yah patakatha aakhir kaise likhi gai?aaie, pehle janvari, 2016 main chalate hai
 Ajit Jogi's son and Congress MLA Amit is expelled from the party, as a 2014 tape surfaced in which he was heard allegedly stalking and bargaining in a by-election
 pradesh congress ke pramukh bhupesh baghel, jo jogi ke dhur virdohi or congress kii maujuuda jeet ke do sutaradhaaron main se ek hai, ne amit ke khilaaf teji se kadam uthaaya or natijatan unke pita ko bhi party chhodie ko majaboor kar diya
 Baghel told the central leadership, working under the influence and influence of the big Jogi, that he had strangled several party candidates in 2008 and 2013 as well, losing these candidates by a small margin of votes
 unhone kaha ki party jogi ke bagaiyr zyada acchhee rahegi
 Rahul Gandhi, who was then the vice president of the party, cried at him
 un par vah faisla aaj kargar sabit hua
 Interestingly, Jogi was being accused of being the "B team" of Raman Singh and now it seems that he has finally damaged the BJP

 Ironically, when Jogi was ill, BJP leader Brijmohan Aggarwal said in India Today's state-direction conclave, "the BJP prays for Ajit Jogi's early recovery
 aakhirkaar vahi bhaajapa ke liye chauthaa kaarykaal pakkaa karenge

 vahiin jila prashasan kaa kahana he ki gyaapan lene ke liye esadm ko yahi bulaayaa gaya tha par kaaryakrtta jabardastee karne lage, jin par aansu gas kaa istemaal kar kuch kaaryakartaaon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he

 oneplus 5 has been launched, but in India it will be launched on 22 June
 spacifications or dizin to pehle hi saamne aa gaye the ab isamen die gaye oparating system or fitures ke bare main bhi hamane aapako bataae hai
 But apart from all this, One Plus is facing allegations of confusion
 reports ke mutabik van plus ne ek baar phir se benchmark eps ko bhram main rakhane yani jhuthe riglats dikhaane ke liye aniatik tareekon kaa prayog kiya he
 The Mobile Developers Community XDA Developers report states that oneplus 5 has shown better results by tampering with benchmark scores while the actual results are not
 benchmark main behatar rigelt dikhaane ke liye oneplus 5 ke limited divaais ko aisa banaaya gaya he ki jaise hi yah smartphone kisi benchmark ap ko detect karata he vaise hi isaki speed badhkar maximum ho jaati he
 oneplus 5 has scored higher in geekbench 4 with similar technology
 iske alaava oneplus 5 ke is aniatik takanic se geekbench 4 hi nahin balki antutu, Android Bench or Nemark 2 jaise benchamark ap ko prabhavit kiya he
 When XDA spoke to oneplus in the matter of tampering with the benchmark result, the company spokesperson said, 'people use benchmark apps to check the performance of their device and we want users to get real performance of oneplus 5 Come to know isliye hamane benchmark eps ko apane divaais main daily yuses ke hisaab se parmishan diya he
 We have not overclocked the device, that is, it has not deliberately increased the speed for a higher score in the benchmark, but rather the benchmark scores tell about the possible performance of oneplus
 ’agar aapako benchmark ke bare main nahin pataa to aapako bataa den ki yah ek tarah kaa tul he jise smartphone ke parformens kii jaanch karne ke liye yuj kiya jaataa he
 Normally we use it during the review of the smartphone so that the company can find out how the smartphone performs in real life against the claims of the company
 XDA developers ne apni website par likhaa he ki oneplus 5 ke rivyuu main benchmark par yakeen na karen, kyonki hamaare unit main dhokhaa kiya gaya he
 oneplus 5 awarded to XDA has scored 6,700 in Geekbench's Multicorebenchmark, which is higher than the Mi 6's benchmark score
 in donon smartfones main ek qolkom kaa snapadragon 835 procesar die gaye hai
 In such a situation, XDA believes that the units given to them have been shown to have unethically increased the Melticor benchmark result by 5 per cent
 haalanki smartphone industry main pehle bhi kai aise maukey aae hai jab companiyon ne benchmark par score badhaane ke liye aise aniatik tareekon kaa prayog kiya he
 oneplus says it has done nothing unethical
 baharhaal ham is smartphone kaa rivyuu karenge to shaayad aap ise behatar tareeke se samaj paaen
 For this you will have to wait a bit

 After uniting the land for ten years, there was such a news, for which America, the world's largest superpower, had put all its wealth, all its strength and its reputation in centuries at stake
 dekhen kahaan or kaise maaraa gaya osama |america main jashn2 may 2011 kii raat kareeb ek baje america nausena ke commando sil kaa dasta apane sabase mushkil, sabase khufia or sabase khaufnak mishan par tha
 
 
 Operation Neptune Spear had begun at midnight in a foreign country
 sil kii ek-ek harakat par siie headquarter kii nazar thi
 US President Barack Obama was present in the White House situation room along with his select advisers
 saamne screen par siie chif leone peneta siie headquarter se ankhon dekha haal suna rahe the, jabaki afghanistan ke bagraam air base main oparation neptune spear ke commander wiliam ech makerevan maujuud the
 These are the victims of Osama's attack
 
 
 america khufia agenciyon ne kareeb 9 saal kii mehnat ke baad pukhta saboot juta liye the ki america kaa sabase bada dushman osama bin laden pakistan ke abtabad kii haveli main chipa he, lekin ye koi nahin jaanata tha ki navy sil ke oparation ke vakt osama vahaan milegaa bhi yaa nahin
 No one even knew how many people would be with Osama bin Laden in the mansion, in which position
 abtabad kii haveli pahunche navy sil ko osama ke is adde kaa wo nakshaa maaloom tha, jise siie ne neshnal jeeyospacial intelligence agency kii madad se taiyaar kiya tha
 The CIA had informed the Chief of Naval Joint Special Operations Command, Admiral William H
 mcraven, the details of the mansion in Abbottabad only in January
 khud navy sil commando rah chuke makerevan ection ke liye taiyaar the
 He selected 76 commandos from Naval Seal Special Squad Davagru and started his training
 siie ke langle compound ke printing plant ko training centre main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 Vice Admiral mcraven was ready for Operation Osama, but he was also worried that the Pakistani Air Force should not cause any interruption as soon as the seal is entered in Abbottabad
 raashtrapati obama kii bhi sabase badi chintaa yahi thi, jisaki vajah se wo pakistan ko bataae bina abtabad main commando kii chhapemari se hichak rahe the
 Training of the special squad of Navy seals was going on, but no commandos knew when, where and against the action to be taken
 osama ke adde ke bare main sirf siie ke chif leone peneta, vaais admiral makerevan, raashtrapati baraak obama or unke behad bharosemand salaahkaaron ko pataa tha
 President Obama was in a dilemma as to what to do to eliminate Osama
 pehla vikalp tha pakistan ko bharose main lekar abtabad main america khufia agency saajha karrwai kare, lekin siie ko pakistan sarkaar par ratti bhar bharosa nahin tha
 President Obama himself believed that even if the Government of Pakistan had a clue, this information would reach Osama in less than a second
 navy sil kii kaabiliyat par america main kisi ko shaq nahin tha, lekin dephence secretary robert gates or duusare military afasar soch main duube the ki agar cills ke oparation ke dauraan osama haveli main maujuud naa rahaa to kya hoga? wo sirf ummid ke sahare apane commandos kii beshkeemtee zindagiyaan daanv par lagane se hichak rahe the, isliye chaahate the ki kyon naa raat ke andhere main abtabad kii puri haveli ko hi matiamet kar diya jaae
 The US Defense Minister was confident that two of his stealth B-2 bombers could easily enter Abbottabad by fomenting Pakistan's radar and blowing up Osama's mansion with a blink of a bomb, but there was a big danger
 siie ko pataa nahin tha ki haveli main bunker he yaa nahin
 Experts from the Ministry of Defense were saying that if we assume that there is a bunker, then a bomb weighing 910 kg will have to be dropped to demolish the mansion with the bunker
 itnaa shaktishaalee dhamaakaa hota, to abtabad kii haveli ke saath aas-paas ke makaan bhi dhwast hone kaa khatra tha
 It would have killed at least a dozen innocents
 abtabad main bam giraane kii baat 29 march kii meeting main ho rahi thi
 This method was effective, but the question was whether Osama died in the bomb blast or not, how will it be confirmed
 raashtrapati obama pareshaan the ki agar bambaari main osama batch gaya or begunaah maare gaye, to puri duniya main america kii kirakiri hogi
 At the same time, relations with Pakistan will deteriorate further, which will have to be borne by the US and NATO forces in Afghanistan
 aakhirkaar obama ne bam giraane kaa plan khaarij kar diya or vaais admiral makerevan ko abtabad main helicopter red kii taiyaari karne ko kaha
 On April 10, Seals commandos in North Carolina and Nevada on April 18 finalized their preparations by rehearsing, on the other hand, President Obama's security advisors strategized to deal with the problems faced during the action
 america ko bharosa tha ki uske khaas helicopter pakistani radar ko gachha dekar abtabad pahunch jaaenge
 Still, if Pakistan got a clue, then the US would have got news as soon as Pakistani Air Force fighter planes flew, because the US had given F-16 fighting Falcon to Pakistan and the US intelligence agents were monitoring the Fighting Falcon
 ye tay ho chukaa tha ki agar cills ne osama ko jinda pakadaa, to use fouran bagraam air base le jaaya jayega
 If Seals was surrounded by Pakistani security agencies, then Admiral Mike Mullen was assigned the responsibility of contacting Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Parvez Kiyani
 19 april kii meeting main raashtrapati obama ne abtabad main navy sil ko helicopter red kii taiyaari karne ko kaha, lekin wo ab bhi hichak rahe the ki kahin sara khel ulataa naa pad jaae
 The US knew that if it failed this time, then it would be almost impossible for Osama to be caught alive or dead
 is mishan kaa sara daaromadar ab navy sil kii kaabiliyat par tha
 The CIA, meanwhile, built a mansion on an acre of land in Bagaram, Afghanistan, which was similar to the mansion of Huw Abbottabad
 bagraam kii isi haveli main sil commando kii final training shuru hui
 The Navy seals have until now been told that the name of their victim is Osama bin Laden, but Osama's base where the commandos were to wreak havoc was not given to Seal Team Six
 29 april ko subah 8 bajkar 20 minute par raashtrapati obama ne is mishan se jude apane salaahkaaron ko white house ke diplomatic resepshan room main bulaayaa or abtbad main commando karrwai kii hari jhandi de di
 Seal now had to move on, but a bad news came in the evening
 raashtrapati obama ko bataaya gaya ki abtabad main badal ghire hue hai, isliye aaj raat main oparation mumkin nahin he
 On April 30, President Obama spoke to Vice Admiral mcraven
 unhone sil commandos ke liye shubhakamana di
 It was a hint that the work should be finished quickly
 ek may ko obama subah-subah golf khilne nikal gaye, lekin khel khatm kiye bina waapas laut aae
 Obama was with his colleagues in the situation room
 abtabad kii haveli ke upar mandara rahe america drone kaa nite vijan camera dikhaa rahaa tha ki stealth technology se las do blike hoque helicopter sil commando ko lekar abtabad kii haveli tak pahunch chuke hai
 Admiral mcraven, present in Bagram, was stating that two Shinook helicopters and 24 SEAL commandos for Emergency were present between Jalalabad and Abbottabad
 abtabad kii haveli main maujuud osama bekhbar tha ki uske sir par maut mandara rahi he
 The commandos sealing from the Black Hawk helicopter came down on the rope and started without losing a moment, the most sensational encounter in history
 sil commando ne abtabad kii haveli se baahar nikalne ke sabhi raaston par morcha sambhaal liya
 The seal team moved forward, cleaning each corner of the mansion
 is dauraan osama kaa daakiya al kuwaiti, uskaa rishtedaar abraar, abraar kii bivi bushara or osama ke do jawan bete sil team kii goliyon kaa shikaar ho chuki thi
 Osama and his wives and children lived on the second and third floors of the mansion in Abbottabad
 sil commando jab osama ke bedroom main daakhil hue, to vahaan kurta-pyjama pahane osama maujuud tha
 Also her two wives - Osama's youngest wife Amal hid Osama behind her
 sil commando ne amal ke pair main goli maari or phir ek sil commando ke rifl se nikali goli osama ke seene main pabast ho gai
 Osama fell to the ground on his back
 tabhi ek duusare commando ne uske maathe par goli maar di
 The mission was successful
 wireles radio par sil kii awaz gunji
 
 
 For God and Country
 
 
 jironimo, jironimo
 
 
 Jironimo
 
 
 ikeie
 For the first time, expressions of relief shone on the face of President Obama, who remained calm in the situation room till now
 oparation osama kaamyaab ho chukaa tha, lekin abhi khatm nahin hua tha
 The seal commandos took Osama's body
 vahaan maujuud computer kii hard discs, sidi, dividi or duusare dastauez samete or bina vakt ganvaae waapas laut aae bagraam air base
 The DNA sample of Osama's dead body was matched to the sample of his half-sister
 puri tarah nishchit hone ke baad america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ne duniya ke saamne elaan kiya ki duniya kaa sabase bada aatanki osama bin laden khatm ho chukaa he
 The US commandos entered the cantonment of Pakistan and hunted it, and Pakistan was also shocked when Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called and told General Kiani
 ye duniya kaa sabase sansanikhez commando oparation tha
 Apart from this master plan, there was no way to eliminate Osama, the master mind of spreading terror
 ye us dushmani kaa ant tha
 Equally sensational, as frightening was the beginning of this enmity

 is baat se bekhbar ki duniya kaa sabase khatarnaak aatankwaadi sanghathan america ko dahalane ke liye duniya kaa sabase khaufnak plan bana chukaa he
 On 11 September 2001 in New York, 8 am
 46 baje world trade centre se pehle vimaan kii takkar hui
 American Airlines flight number 11 collided with the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York
 logon ko jab tak kuch samaj main aata, tab tak dakshini tower main missile kii tarah pabast hua ek or vimaan
 This aircraft was flight number 175 of United Airlines
 neuyork kii pahchaan world trade centre ke judwa tower dekhte hi dekhte zameendos ho gaye
 
 
 People had realized that this is not a minor accident
 
 
 , ye america par hamalaa he
 
 
 But even then no one knew that this was just the beginning of the attack
 
 
 11 sitambar 2001 ko pentagon main subah 9
 The next shocking news came at 37
 american airlines kii flite number 77 pentagon kii building se takaraai
 Shortly after this, news came at 10:30 in the morning that Flight 93 of United Airlines had collided in Pennsylvania
 dedh ghante se bhi kam samay main ek ke baad ek chaar yatri vimaanon kii is takkar se america main koharaam much gaya
 Nobody in America was aware of who is attacking this? The first fear was that the White House is also not on target? The CIA transported President George Bush to his Air Fort airforce-one without delay
 america ke sabhi hawaii adde band kar die gaye
 US Air Force combat ships were engaged in reconnaissance of suspected aircraft in the sky
 dopaher hote-hote saaf ho gaya ki ab koi nayaa khatra america ke sir par nahin he, lekin zamin par jo manzar tha, wo duniya kii iklauti mahashakti america ko khun ke aansu rulaane ke liye kaaphi tha
 The date of 9 / 11 not only changed the picture here, but this date became an example of awe on the hearts and minds of the whole world
 osama bin laden ke aatanki sanghathan alqaida se america ko khatra pehle se tha
 US intelligence agencies knew that terrorists could hijack planes and detonate planes full of passengers, but no one could have imagined that Osama bin Laden was going to attack American passenger planes for the biggest attack on America He is about to be used as a bomb
 america par aatank kaa ye bhayanak hamalaa paanch saal kii taiyaariyon kaa natiza tha
 The dreaded plan to hijack the plane and hit it with America's important targets first came to the mind of Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, the deputy of Osama bin Laden
 khalid shaikh mohammad ko world trade centre se jane kya dushmani thi
 On 26 February 1993, Khalid's nephew Ramzi Yusuf planted an explosive-laden car in the basement of the North Tower of the World Trade Center and blew it up
 is dhamaake main 6 log maare gaye the
 The idea of khalid Sheikh Muhammad was postponed by Osama in 1996
 wo tab sudan se al qaayada kaa boria-bistar samet kar afghanistan main apana base taiyaar kar rahaa tha
 Although in 1996, Osama warned the US to withdraw its army from Saudi Arabia, but the US did not take Osama's warning seriously
 phir 1998 main osama ne america ke khilaaf aar-paar kii ladaai kaa elaan kar diya
 The date of 7 August 1998 is also important
 africa deshon tanzania or kenya main america duutavaason par ek saath aatanki hamalaa hua
 In this attack trucks loaded with explosives were used
 kenya main 212 log or tanzania main 11 log in aatanki hamalon main maare gaye
 For the first time after the attacks on the US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, the US began to seriously consider Osama bin Laden a threat to itself
 20 agast 1998 ko america ne afghanistan main osama ko khatm karne kii koshish kii
 The US fired 66 missiles at al Qaeda's training camps in Khost, Afghanistan, but Osama survived and looked for an opportunity to stun the US like a wounded serpent
 america se badla lene ke liye 1999 main osama ne khalid shaikh mohammad ko hamale kaa plan banane kii jimmedaari saunpi
 Khalid Sheikh had already drawn up a blueprint for hijacking the plane and using it as a bomb
 iske liye paison kaa intazaam osama ne kiya or usee ne khalid shaikh ke saath milakar un 19 aatankwaadiyon kii list taiyaar kii, jinhen plane hijac karnaa tha
 Among the terrorists who had to hijack the plane, Hani Hanjour had a commercial pilot license
 osama ne nawaf al haazmi, khalid al mahazir, mohammad atta, maaravaan al shehi or jiyaad jarrah ko plane udaane kii training lene kaa farmaan sunaaya
 When Osama was convinced that his henchmen had now learned to fly improvised aircraft, he sent the rest of the terrorists to America for final preparations
 july 2001 main osama ke gurgon ne america par jald se jald hamale kii hari jhandi dene ko kaha
 As soon as Osama's signal was received, 19 suicide terrorists prepared for the terror attack took off in four separate planes from Boston, Nevada and Washington DC
 paanch-paanch-paanch or chaar kii team main bante aatankiyon ne pehle vimaan hijac kiya or phir baari-baari se vimaanon ko missile banaakar kar diya america par sabase bada aatanki hamalaa
 These attacks changed America's thinking
 apni takat par gumaan karne vaala america pehali baar khaufazada hua
 In the 9 / 11 terror attacks, 2977 people including 19 terrorists were killed
 ab baari thi america ke palatwaar kii
 America now wanted Osama
 kisi bhi keemat par, zindaa yaa murda
 The US declared a war against terror, which no one had any idea of what to pay
 haalanki pichley 10 saal main america main koi aatanki hamalaa nahin hua
 The American people have also been emboldened after the death of Osama bin Laden, but, according to a New York Times and CBS News shared survey, 38 percent of New Yorkers still believe that a terrorist attack will happen in the next few days
 puure america main aatanki hamale ke dar ke saae main jeene waalon kii taadaad 42 fisadi he
 Every year on 9 / 11, ground zero comes to celebrate mourning
 apano kii yaad main aansu bahaate hai or khud se ye sawaal poochhate hue chale jate hai ki kya vaaki aatank ke khilaaf is jang kaa koi ant he? The Mumbai Airport Intelligence Unit has recovered 8 kg of gold from an airplane toilet

 unhone gayan kii kabhi vidhivat shiksha nahin lee
 Nevertheless he was highly successful as a singer

 Whenever their songs are heard, they go into the depths of the heart
 unke geeton main jo ullas miltaa he
 He sets them apart from other singers
 unke dard bhare geet aaj bhi logon kii jubaan par hai
 Sad song my song is considered his most painful song
 ek comic actor ke taur par unhone apni ek alag pahchaan banaai kai abhinetriyon ke saath unki jodi jami, madhubala, nutan, mira kumari or kumkum shaamil hai
 He did not have many friends in the film world, he did not have many friends in the film world
 wo khaali samay main apane ghar hi rahanaa pasand karte the
 But he also lived in many controversies
 aisa kaha jaataa he
 Once some people of the Income Tax Department came to his house, he left his dogs on them
 unhonen apane ghar ke baahar likhva rakhaa tha ki kishor kumaar se bachakar

 Fake news and rumors are going on on whatsapp, but fake whatsapp are also being installed
 kai ap developers yani ap creat karne vaale watsap kaa modiphoid varjan bana rahe hai
 whatsapp has updated its FAQ page so that users can install the original whatsapp
 watsap ne logon ko agaah kiya he ki agar wo whatsapp kaa koi oltard varjan yuj karte hai to company unka acount bain kar sakati he
 Talking about this type of version, there are apps like whatsapp Plus and gbwhatsapp that people install
 jin yugers ne gbwhatsapp install kiya he unhen ek in ap massej dikhegaa jisamen bataaya jayega ki unka acount kuch samay ke liye bain kiya ja rahaa he
 The company says that users should remove those apps and immediately install the original version of whatsapp
 whatsapp ke FAQ pej par likhaa he, ‘whatsapp Plus or GB whatsapp jaise ansported eps oltard hai
 They are not official and have been prepared by third party developers in violation of our terms and conditions
 watsap is tarah ke third party eps ko isliye nahin saport karata he, kyonki ham inaki security practice ko validet nahin kar sakate hai’in oltard eps se asli watsap ap main switch karan se pehle kya karen company ne bataaya he
 According to the company, make a backup of your chat history, although whatsapp also does not guarantee that this process will work, because these are not official apps
 --- kuch samay ke liye bain hone kaa intjaar karen
 The timer will show how long your ban is
 --- GB whatsapp open karen, More par tap karen yaha chats ke andar byaap chats kaa opshan dikhegaa
 --- Go to phone settings and tap on storage, click on the files here
 --- GB whatsapp foulder search karen or ise select karen
 --- Tap on More near the upper right corner and rename this folder to 'whatsapp'
 --- byaap found screen par Restore tap karen
 Here existing whatsapp chats will be loaded
 agar aap whatsapp Plus yuj kar rahe hai or aapaki chat history sevd he to yah khud se oficial watsap main jaani chahie
 To save this chat history, install the official app and verify with the same phone number
 kya hai whatsapp Plus or gbwhatsappye eps oficial nahin hai, yani watsap ne inhen nahin banaaya he
 These have extra features, for example here you can create two accounts simultaneously
 yahaan aap colls block kar sakate hai or auto riplai jaise fitures kaa bhi yuj kar sakate hai
 Such features are not available in real whatsapp
 ise ap developers apane phaayde ke liye banaate hai or play store yaa apike websites par aplod karte hai
 People often make the mistake of downloading it as a version of whatsapp
 isliye ye yaad rakhen ki watsap original or ek watsap bijness he
 Apart from this, no version of whatsapp has come from the company
 agar aap is tarah ke eps yuj karte hai to ye bhi shyor nahin he ki aapkaa chats yaa personal data kitna sicyor he
 a 'confidential audit report' has exposed the wasteful expenditure of Bihar Governor Devanand Kunwar
 prisipleeccountint general (pieji) dwaara karai gai 67 pannon kii audit jaanch se, jisaki copy india today ke paas he, pataa chalata he ki aam taur par anivaasee rajyapal bane rahane ke alaava kunwar ne apane vivekadhin kosh kaa durupyog kiya, aniyamit kharid or niyuktiyon ko bhi anjaam diya
 After his appointment, the Governor has visited his home state 25 times in the last three years
 niyamon ke mutabik ve nijee kaam se ek saal main keval do baar yatra karne ke hakdaar hai
 This in-depth investigation has revealed shocking figures
 report ke mutabik, july, 2009 se march, 2012 ke bich, rajyapal kunwar ne apane pad par 1,004 din bitaye hai-jisamen se unhone 192 din apane grih rajya main gujaarey
 In total, the Governor was on an out-of-state tour for 306 days during this period
 iskaa arth yah hua ki apni niyukti ke baad se kunwar apane kaarykaal ke har chauthe din bihar ke baahar daure par rahe or har chathe din apane grih rajya main rahe
 The Governor's Secretariat paid Rs
 15,68,534
 to pichley teen vitt varsh main keval hawaii kiraaya chukaane main kharch kiye, jab bharat sarkaar kharchon main katautee kii baat kar rahi thi
 There is no known reason why the Governor of Bihar had to make so many trips or what government purpose was served by his visits
 rajyapal ne kai yatraaen to raashtrapati se purv anumati ke bina kii hai, jo anivaary hoti he
 Not only this, PAG spent Rs 4,31,973 on his air trips
 kii vasuuli kii sifarish bhi kii he
 Perhaps for the first time a governor has been asked to repay government money spent on his tours
 rajyapal ke pramukh sachiv afjal amanulla ne india today ko bataaya ki accountint general ke karyaalay ko iskaa jawaab bhej diya jayega
 Amanullah said, "this is a preliminary report and we cannot comment on it yet
" ''is report main 32 aniyamittaaon ko soochibaddh kiya gaya he, jise agle varsh rajya vidhansabha main aadhikarik taur par pesh kar diya jayega
 Government sources say that although this is only a preliminary inquiry report, most of the disclosures made in it will be included in the final report as no one can be responded to the irregularities in expenditure incurred in travel, purchase, appointment and other items
 apane grih rajya assam se rajyapal kii nikatataa sirf unki yatraaon tak hi simit nahin he
 Kunwar has also released funds from his discretionary fund to organizations in his home state, to which few people have heard his name
 2010-12 ke dauraan rajyapal ne saat sanghathanon ko ek-ek lakh ru
 5, of whom are from Assam
 kai baar anudaan jari karne ke aspasht kaaran bataae gaye hai; jaise 'vikaas uddeshy ke liye' or 'vittiya sahaayta' ke naam par mujffarpur ke nupur kala ashram ko 'ballat nirmaan ke liye' anudaan diya gaya
 According to the rules, discretionary grants from public funds can also be investigated in the same way as any other expenditure of government money
 isamen do or niyam lagu hote hai, jinke anusaar koi bhi aisa vyay nahin kiya ja saktaa he, jo rajya sarkaar (is maamle main bihar) kii shaktiyon se pare ho, or yah ki koi kharch baar-baar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Repeated grants to organizations in Assam violate the first rule, while repeated grants to the Mahila Imdad Committee, headed by the Governor's wife as chairman, and one to Lily Gupta Gaya payment violates the second condition, which prohibits repeated payments
 lily gupta patna main rahane vaali ek purv vidhayak kii beti hai, jo khud ko saamaajik kaaryakarta bataati hai
 He was paid Rs 50,000 twice in 2010-11 and 2011-12
 kaa anudaan neshnal skool of blind ke liye rajyapal kunwar se mila
 Gupta as Secretary of Sahyog Seva Samiti in 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07, had a total of Rs
 13,000
 praapt kiye the
 In 2008-09, Gupta was awarded honorary secretary of the National Blind Association from Kunwar's erstwhile governor for Rs 30,000
 mili the
 Reportedly, he now received the grant under a new designation
 sanyog se gupta ne is baat kii pushti kii he ki unki association netraheen logon ke liye vokational centre kabhi kabhaar hi chalaati he
 The audit report states that 'it cannot be denied' that 'repeated misuse of public funds' has occurred because there is no receipt of grants from the beneficiaries, nor any personal accounts in front of their names
 The number of is mentioned
 rajyapal ko har saal apane vivekadhin kosh ke liye 10 lakh ru
 Are allocated
 is sabase badhkar, audit main yah bhi paaya gaya he ki kai maamalon main rajyapal ne apane vivekadhin kosh kii raashi vitt varsh ke antim din jari kii he, jo sambhawatah labhaarthiyon ko sanyog se samay par madad karne kii bajaae, kosh kii raashi ko laps hone se bachaane ke liye thi
 Governor Kunwar's visit to the public on behalf of his private secretary Ramprakash Pereva, Advisor Giri Reddy, University Inspector B

 Singh and his wife and former member of the National Commission for Women, Neeva Kunwar have also been partners
 patna main rajyapal ke sachivalay ne do baar niva kii udaanon kii tikat kaa bhugtan kiya he, jab unhone akavle udaan bhari thi jabaki pareva or reddy ne akasar rajyapal dampati ke saath yatraaen kii hai, jo rajyapal ke bhatte or visheshadhikaar (gap) niyamavali kaa spasht ulanghan he
 According to the rules, only the Governor's spouse or an attendant can travel with them during a government air flight
 rajyapal ke nijee sachiv prakaash pareva kii yatra ke vivaran mahatvapurn hai
 In a five-day period between October 8 and 13, 2009, Perewa traveled five times by air - Patna to Kolkata on October 8, Kolkata to Agartala on October 9, Agartala to Delhi on October 11, Delhi to Agartala on October 12 and Agartala to Delhi on October 13

 N
 singh ne bhi-jinase bihar ke vishvavidhyalayon kaa nirikshan karne kii apeksha kii jaati he-kai baar janata ke paise par kolkata, guwahati or dilli ke liye hawaii yatra kii he, haalanki bihar kaa koi vishvavidhyalay rajya ke baahar nahin he
 There is no answer as to why Parewa needed to do so many trips or why Singh traveled to other states, yet all these bills were paid from the government treasury
 rajyapal kisi rajya main sarkaar ke sanvaidhanik or kaaryakari pramukh hote hai, unki vahi bhoomika hoti he, jo centre main raashtrapati kii hoti he
 Kunwar had been in political exile for five years after Tarun Gogoi came out of the government in 2004 and before he was appointed as the Governor of Bihar
 endie shasit bihar main rajya sarkaar ke saath kunwar ke takaraav ko centre sarkaar mote taur par andekha karti rahi kyonki jaahir taur par kunwar dwaara rajya sarkaar kii hethi karne se congress shasit centre ko raahat mahasoos hoti he
 But, it may force the audit center to break its silence on Kunwar

 In this case, Kejriwal enjoys the same thing
 kyonki unka ek aashwaasan adhuraa rah gaya jise wo vaaki puraa karnaa chaahate the
 Perhaps destiny was not acceptable
 kejariwal ke 'bhagwaan'kejariwal un patrkaar ke isliye fain ban gaye kyonki unhone apane kute kaa naam 'editor' rakhaa hua tha
 Taking inspiration from them, Kejriwal gave the license of Jabrivolver and named it 'bhagwan'
 aapane suna hoga ki kejariwal ne suraksha lene se manaa kar diya tha
 Whenever there was only one answer to the issue of security, they only trust 'god'
 abhi kam logon ko ye baat maaloom hogi ki kejariwal kis bhagwaan kii baat karte hai
 Kejriwal always keeps this 'god' with him

 Simultaneously, Singh also said that if we put a hat-trick of victory, then it is possible that people will also pay attention to me

 But for this it is necessary to win the third election

 air force ne pakistan ke balakot main 26 farvari ko kiye gaye hawaii hamale kaa rivyuu kiya he
 It states that five out of six targets were targeted in jaish-e-mohammed's terrorist training complex
 angreji akhbaar indian express ko ek sutara ne bataaya ki airforce kii is rivyuu main hamalon kii takat, kamajori or isse sena ne kya siikhaa, iske bare main puri jaankaree di gai he
 It states that there could have been even better weapons to attack targets accurately
 saath hi pakistan ke propaganda yuddh ko jeetne ke liye feedback loop ko or bhi prabhavi banaaya ja saktaa tha
 The army has been praised for its complete preparedness of attack, secrecy, efficiency of pilots and impromptu attacks on targets
 sutron ke mutabik, balakot par hamale ke liye chah israeli spice 2000 pentrator tip pijiem (priscygen gided munishan) kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 These six pgms targeted five targets in the Balakot terrorist complex
 ain vakt par ek pijiem miraj 2000 se alag na ho sakaa jis kaaran uskaa nishaanaa chook gaya
 The reason behind this is the Mirage's 35-year-old aircraft, whose navigation system also has some immediate lapses
 iskaa kaaran yah bataaya gaya he ki pijiem or miraj kii timming main shaayad koi antar aa gaya jis kaaran pijiem kii firing main gadabadi saamne ai
 Apart from the Spice 2000, the Indian Airforce used the Crystal Mage AGM 142
 haalanki yah thik se kaam na kar sakaa kyonki payalat ko nishane ke upar badal kii moti paraten dikhin jisase unhen target aria pahchaanane main chook ho gai
 If a clear video image of the attack on the target was obtained from the crystal image, then the Airforce would not face any hindrance but due to bad weather it could not happen
 antarrashtriya media ne isi kamajori ko duniya main oochhaalane kaa kaam kiya kyonki unhone saboot ke naam par dhundhlee tasviren milane kaa hawala diya
 "we achieved our target and hit five targets in six," the source told The Indian Express
 ek pijiem kaa upyog na ho sakaa lekin jis prakaar kaa propaganda yuddh chalaaya gaya usase paar paanaa jaruri tha
 For this, we needed a weapon that would completely destroy the target and we should have got a clear picture and video of this destruction
 'gauratlab he ki pulavama main jaish-e-mohammad ke aatmghaatee hamalavar ke hamale main siarpief ke 40 javaanon kii maut hone ke baad bharat ne kaha tha ki usne balakot sthit jaish ke sabase bade training camp par hamalaa kar vahaan bahut badi sankhya main aatankwaadiyon or unke trainer ko maar giraaya
 At the same time Pakistan had admitted that Indian Air Force planes attacked in Balakot
 usne daawa kiya ki pakistani vimaan ke khadedane par bharat ke ladaaku vimaan waapas laut gaye the or jamini str par koi nuksaan nahin hua
 Although the Indian Air Force Chief B
 es
 Dhanoa said air force planes had attacked their targets
 isse pehle news agency royatres ne ek report di thi ki balakot main nishaanaa banaai gai imaaraten bina kisi kshati ke vahiin khadi dikh rahi hai
 He said that at least six buildings were visible at the scene on March 4, four days after the attack, and the picture looked like a photo taken from the site in April 2018

 Why did the Prime Minister bypass HAL (hindustan Aeronautics Limited) and hand over the deal to an AA rated (high-powered) businessman with no defense experience? Dear RM, what's shameful is your boss silencing you
 Please tell us :1
 Final price of each Rafale jet? 2
 Did PM take CCS permission before announcing purchase in Paris?3

 Afghanistan will play their first test, versus India and in India: Amitabh Chaudhary, BCCI Joint Secretary pic
 twitter
 com / qxrsfcw7g6india to play inaugural test against Afghanistan
 welcome them to five-day cricket
 @ acbofficials @ BCCI bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ab tak isi hunar main maahir thi ki jin rashtriya netaaon ke divangat hone ke baad unhen unki party yaa vichaardhaara na puch rahi ho, unhen chupake se apane paale main dikhaa do
 In the case of BJP, Sardar Patel and in the case of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Sardar Bhagat Singh is the biggest example of this
 lekin arase baad bijepi main waapas aakar party ke anusuchit jati morche ke adhyaksh bane 52 varshiya sanjay paswan ne to sidhe bahujan samaaj party (bispi) ke sansthaapak manyavar kanshiram kii viraasat par hi haath saaf kar diya he
 Kanshi Ram's picture hangs with full respect just above Paswan's chair at BJP headquarters at 11, Ashok Road in New Delhi and the party's Dalits have no hesitation in taking inspiration from Kanshi Ram
 yah tasviir aapane party adhyaksh rajnath singh ko bataakar taangi thi yaa taangane ke baad bataaya tha, is sidhe sawaal par paswan kaa jawaab tha, ‘meri party jaanati he ki meraa kaam karne kaa tarika alag he
 After hanging the picture, i informed the party president and he welcomed it
 ’ haalanki ve yah nahin bataa sake ki is tasviir ke rashtriya adhyaksh ke kaksh or party ke mukhya manchon par pahunchane main kitna vakt lagegaa
 Listen to the clever reply of Paswan, who was the Minister of State in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, a Dalit leader of Bihar: 'right now a picture has come in one corner of the party, the whole horizon is open
 ’bijepi ko lag rahaa he ki 2014 ke chunaav main uske paas vaaki asli mauka ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, whoever is a potential voter, leave no stone unturned to join him
 dalit voter ab tak bijepi kii kamjor kadi sabit hota rahaa he
 At one time, BJP had elevated its Dalit agenda by making Bangaru Laxman the national president, but the decline of Bangaru came to an end
 bijepi kii nigaah ek aisi soshal ejineering par he, jahaan dalit voter ko hindutv ke naam par hi apane saath laayaa jaae
 The BJP keeps raising the issue that those who are Dalit Hindus should get the benefit of reservation
 isai yaa musalmaan ho gaye daliton ko yah laabh na mili
 This is also the basis of the BJP to oppose the Sachar Committee report
 paswan behichak sweekaar karte hai ki kanshiram ke samarthak daliton kaa ek bada tabaka aisa bhi he jo mayawati se asantusht he
 The BJP is preparing a new space for the same segment
 darasal paswan nitin gadakari ke adhyakshiya kaarykaal main tay hue us agenda ko aage badha rahe hai, jisamen 16 fisadi dalit voter ko party ke saath jodgaye kaa lakshya tay kiya gaya tha
 Apparently, to associate a class with its heroes is to declare its heroes as its heroes

 You can also see the picture of Narayanan
 yahaan kisi aise dalit mahapurush kaa chitra nahin milegaa aapako, jisaki jaden bijepi, uski saathi sansthaaon yaa sangh parivaar main hon
 These four leaders Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram, Jagjivan Ram and Narayanan represent West, North, East and South India respectively which has a political implication in itself
 party agle charan main dalit mahilaon, dalit karmchaariyon, dalit udhyamiyon or dalit sansthaanon ke saath samvaad kaayam karegi
 Activists are being activated for this work
 chote-chote sammelnon kii shrunkhlaa puri karne ke baad party kaa alpsankhyak morcha dilli main in chaaron virgon kaa bada sammelan yojit karegaa
 The strategy is good and it also has the impression of Kanshi Ram, who focused his movement on bringing the Dalit employees along
 lekin shahari aadhaar vaali party gaanv main rahane vaale 80 fisadi daliton tak kaise pahonchegi

 Digvijay Singh told the Congress workers from the stage that thanks to those who worked for the King and the Congressmen who did not work were 'murdabad'
 apane netaa kaa intazaar kar rahe kaaryakartaaon ne jab unke munh se apane hi liye murdaabaad suna to wo asahaj ho gaye
 After this, Digvijay Singh clarified that no one should feel bad in this because i have not said anything wrong for the workers who did not work in the assembly elections
 pehle kaha tha 'jahaan jaataa hum congress ke vot katate hai'ye koi pehali baar nahin he jab digvijay singh ne apane bayanon se vivaad ko janm diya ho
 Even before the assembly elections, Digvijay Singh had increased the difficulties of the Congress by making a controversial statement
 jab unhone congress kaaryakartaaon se kaha tha ki unke congress ke kaaryakramon main jane or bhaashan dene se congress ke hi vot cat jate hai
 a few days ago, Digvijay also pulled up the work of two ministers of the Kamal Nath government

 ' Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party may have prepared preparations to penetrate the fort of BJP with the weapon of coalition all over Uttar Pradesh, but the road to Bundelkhand is not easy for them
 yahaan samaajawaadee party ke sabase kaddavar or mulaayam singh yadav ke behad kareebi maane jane vaale netaa chandrapal singh yadav naaraaz hai
 Chandrapal Singh Yadav is currently a Rajya Sabha MP, but Akhilesh Yadav has cut his ticket this time
 tikat chandrapal singh ke dhur virdohi maane jane vaale shyaam sundar singh yadav ko mila he
 Shyam Sundar Yadav has contested the BJP before this and that is why Chandrapal Singh Yadav has distanced himself from the election
 kyonki chandrapal singh kii sanghathan par gahari pakad he, isliye unki naaraazgi gathbandhan pratyaashee ke liye grahan sabit ho sakati he
 Shocked by the growing influence of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, Dhruv Akhilesh and Mayawati, the two opposite sides of power, joined hands to join hands
 buaa-babua kii is jodi ko ummid he ki unka gathbandhan uttar pradesh main bhaajapa ko loksabhaa chunaav main shikast dene ke liye prabhavi hoga
 It is also logical in terms of caste equations, but the local politics of satraps will not contribute less to its success
 jhaansi lalitpur loksabhaa seat par samaajawaadee party ke bade netaa chandrapal singh yadav ko tikat nahin milane se unka puraa khemaa khafa he
 Chandrapal Singh has made the path of SP BSP alliance candidate Shyam Sundar Singh Yadav difficult in Jhansi
 ise peeche puraani raajnneetik dushmani he, jis kaaran chandpal singh ne puure chunaav se duuri banaakar apni naaraazgi kaa ahsaas kara diya he
 Which was started by Shyam Sundar Singh himself
 yah dushmani itani gahari he ki akhilesh yadav ke kehane ke baad bhi chandrapal singh yadav ne shyaam sundar ke samarthan kii baat nahin maani he
 This is Dushmani Chandrapal Singh Yadav and Shyam Sundar Singh Yadav are both old leaders of Jhansi
 chandrapal singh yadav hi sapa ke vah netaa hai jinhone 2004 main pehali baar jhaansi loksabhaa chunaav main jeet dilaakar sapa kaa khaataa kholaa tha
 After this, Pradeep Jain of Congress won here in 2009
 jabaki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main uma bharti se chandrapal singh yadav chunaav haar gaye, lekin unhone 3 lakh 80 hajaar vot hasil kar party kaa janaadhar banaae rakhaa
 But in all these elections of Chandrapal Singh Yadav, Shyam Sundar Singh has been against him
 2012 main hue babina vidhasabha chunaav main chandrapal singh yadav babina vidhansabha se sapa pratyaashee the to shyaam sundar singh bhaajapa se chunaav ladqar chandrapal yadav kii haar kaa kaaran ban gaye the
 Then from here Chandrapal Singh lost the election by four thousand votes and the BSP won the election here
 iske baad 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main shyaam sundar chandrapal singh ko haraane ke liye uma bharti ke saath khadey ho gaye or apane mishan main kaamyaab bhi rahe
 Now the claim belongs to Chandrapal Singh
 shyaam sundar singh ne paala badalakar ek baar chandrapal singh kaa tikat katwane main to kamyaabi hasil kar lee, lekin chunaav jeetna unke liye aasaan nahin he
 These questions belong to the Chandrapal camp, after the fact that the Chandrapal Singh Yadav camp has raised questions on their own party
 bataate hai ki khud chandrapal singh yadav ne akhilesh yadav ko apni naaraazgi ke kaaran gina die hai
 Chandrapal said that he strengthened the party from the ground up
 mulaayam singh yadav ke saath ek ek booth taiyaar karaayaa he
 It fought many elections
 vah jite or haare bhi, lekin jab gathbandhan main party ko majboot base mila he to yah seat bhaajapa se dalbadal kar aae pratyaashee ko de di gai
 At present, Chandrapal Singh Yadav has stopped going to all the sp's programs
 unki naaraazgi kii khabaren aam hai
 Chandpal Singh Yadav himself has refused to speak to India Today on this
 ab yadi chandrapal singh yun hi naaraaz rahe to yahaan gathbandhan ke liye jeet kii raah aasaan nahin hogi
