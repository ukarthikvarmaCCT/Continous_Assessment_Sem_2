 prashanth kumaar : Vikrant: centre sarkaar maujuuda vivaadon ke bich jald cabinet pherbadal kar sakati he
 Sources are quoting that he will be discharged in an early cabinet reshuffle following Suresh Prabhu's resignation offer
 cabinet main yah pherbadal 25 agast se do sitambar ke bich ho saktaa he
 The reason for this is that on September 3, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will leave for China
 isse pehle 18 agast se pehle cabinet main pherbadal kii yojana thi, lekin jediu ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar isamen deree ho rahi he
 According to sources, there may be about a dozen changes in the Council of Ministers
 sutron kii maane to sarkaar unke istife ko rail haadason se jodakar nahin dikhaanaa chaahati hai balki aisa sho karnaa chaahati hai ki cabinet pherbadal main unako hataaya hai
 At the same time, important positions like the Ministry of Defense will also be eyeing during the cabinet reshuffle

 In such a situation, after getting this responsibility, Narendra Singh Tomar has five ministries
 vahiin smriti irani ke paas bhi do mantralay kaa bhaar he
 Similarly, since the demise of Anil Madhav Dave in May, Union Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan has been holding additional charge of his environment ministry
 in mantralay par najarrel haadason ke baad agar suresh prabhu kii rail mantralay se chuttee hoti he, to piem modi nitin gadakari ko nayaa railmantri niyukt karenge
 Also, the concept of Super Transport Ministry can be brought to the Ministry of Railways
 saal 2014 main bijepi ke satta main aane ke baad yah vichaar aayaa tha
 However, due to the China dispute, the Ministry of Defense will also be watching
 ab yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki modi arun jetali se koun sa mantralay waapas lete hai
 However, more than one important ministry has already been in the hands of one person
 haalanki ve mantralay aamtaur par ek duusare se jude hote hai
 Finance and Corporate Affairs or the Ministry of Shipping and Road Transport is not a big deal, but if the mismatched departments like finance, defense and textiles, information and broadcasting are given to a single minister, then there is definitely a chance to raise questions

 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne buudhvaar ko kartarpur coridor ke shilanyas ke vakt daawa kiya ki bharat or pakistan donon newclear hathiyaaron se las desh hai
 Imran said- Therefore it is foolish to think of any kind of war between the two countries
 apane is bayaan ke jariye imran khan ne daleel di ki chunki donon desh newclear hathiyaaron se las hai lihaaja samrik shakti main donon desh baraabar hai or yuddh kii sthiti main donon deshon kaa nasht ho janaa tay he
 However, if the actual situation of the two countries and the prevailing principles of war in the current era, if nuclear weapons are used in the war between India and Pakistan, then there is a possibility of a big loss to India, one thing is sure that the world Pakistan will disappear completely from the map
 is baat ko jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke skool of international studies main asistent professor or neshnal security ke kshetra main kaam karne vaale dow saumyajit re vistaar se samajhaate hai
 According to Saumyajit Ray, for several decades, the top brass of the Indian Army has claimed that Pakistan has the ability to give a befitting reply to an adventurer with nuclear weapons
 is daawey ke mutabik yadi pakistan kisi tarah kaa nabhikeey hamalaa bharat par karne kii koshish karata he jahaan bharat us hamale ko vifal karne se lekar javaabi hamale main puure samooche pakistan ko dharti ke nakshe se saaf kar saktaa he
 Nehru Indira failed, will PM Modi make India P-6? Therefore, Imran Khan's claim is far from the truth
 bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh kii sthiti main newclear hathiyaaron kaa istemaal ho athwa na ho or yuddh puri tarah se paaramparik hathiyaaron ke sahare ladaa jaae to bhi ek baat saaf he ki yuddh kaa nateeja bharat ke paksh main rahegaa
 In fact, Imran Khan made his argument based on the principle of MAD (mutually Assured Destruction) of the war between the US and USSR (existing Russia) during the Cold War decades ago
 yah siddhant kahata he ki yadi newclear hathiyaaron se las do desh yuddh ke dauraan newclear hathiyaaron kaa istemaal karte hai to donon deshon main janajivan samaapt ho jayega
 However, Imran Khan ignored this principle and all the aspects that arose during the Cold War
 is siddhant main ek paksh kaa maananaa he ki jab do deshon ke bich bhugolic or sankhyik taur par bada antar maujuud ho to newclear war kii sthiti main jahaan bhugol or jansankhya main bada desh pehle na hamalaa karne kii sandhi par rahe or usapar hamalaa hone kii sthiti main use ek baari nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Another Associate Professor of jnu's School of International Studies, Drs
 rajan kumaar ne bataaya ki dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad or sheet yuddh ke dauraan uasasar ke paas america se adhik newclear hathiyaaron kaa jakhira maujuud tha
 Despite this, America dominated during the decades of the Cold War due to its economy, democratic social environment and geography
 6 guna ho jayega bharat-paak trade, bas aatankwaad se munh mode len imran!professor rajan kumaar doosraa udhaaharan dete hue kehete hai ki maujuuda samay main america or rus donon syria main hastkshep kar rahe hai
 Despite both countries being equipped with nuclear weapons, both countries are showing their power in Syria with the help of conventional weapons
 donon, america or rus newclear hathiyaaron se las desh hone ke baavjood yuddh kii sambhaavna ko murkhataa yaa paagalpan nahin maanate
 Taking these facts as the basis, the question arises that why did Imran Khan call those thinking of war fools or mad? On this question, Dr
 saumyajit re kaa kahana he ki darasal loktantr kii sabase badi khami he ki iske jariye kisi desh ke sheersh pad par koi bhi asin ho saktaa he
 Where ever since the formation of Pakistan, there is only a battle of supremacy between the Pakistan Army and the democratic parties of Pakistan
 inke alaava pakistan main kattarpanthi sansthaaen sena or raajnneetik dalon par dabaav kii raajnneeti karte rahe hai
 However, Pakistan's army has always held the upper hand in this fight and the fundamentalist powers were in support of the army
 lekin loktantric dal hameshaa uske liye sirdard sabit hue hai
 This is the first time in the history of Pakistan when the Pakistani army not only succeeded in raising a radical political party but also put that political party in power
 lihaaja, imran khan kaa yah bayaan pakistani kattarpanth kaa vah cheharaa he jo sena or kattarpanthi sansthaaon kii nitiyon ko aage badhaane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 The Pakistani High Commission reported that it had diplomatic access to Hasnain on 21 November
 bayaan main kaha gaya, ‘‘rajanyik pahunch ke dauraan ladke ne sanket bhashaa main bataaya ki vah pakistan se he

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi wrote a letter to Prime Minister Modi to pass the Women's Reservation Bill in this session of Parliament
 16 july ko unhone letters likh kaha ki bill ko paas karaane ke liye vah sarkaar ke saath hai
 On the other hand, in the Modi government, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has written a reply letter to his letter to Rahul Gandhi
 ravishankar prasadne kaha ki rahul gandhi pehle teen talaak bill kaa samarthan karen
 Prasad said that not only on the women's reservation bill, both the national parties should also come together on the triple talaq, halala and OBC commission bill and set a new precedent
 darasal piem modi or kaanoon mantri ye baat acchhee tarah se jaanate hai ki teen talaak, halaala, nikaah jaise muddon par congress andar se puri tarah se banty hui he
 Taking advantage of this, the Modi government has once again put the ball in the court of Congress
 ravishankar prasad ke patr kaa jawaab dete hue congress saansad sushmita dev ne kaha ki 2014 main bijepi ne apane ghoshnaptr main mahila aarakshan bill rakhaa tha
 Now the government should clear its stand on the Women's Reservation Bill and pass it in this session of Parliament
 kaanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne rahul gandhi par chutki lete hue likhaa ki ham mahila aarakshan bill par aapaki pahal kii tarif karte hai
 But the government wants to know that you will support the bill but your colleagues will not disrupt the proceedings of the House
 ravishankar prasad kaa prashn jaays he
 Because the mps who were tearing down the copy of the Women's Reservation Bill in the Rajya Sabha in 2010, and the parties opposing the bill, are allies of the Congress in the UPA today
 2010 main mahila aarakshan bill ko rajyasabha main paas karaane ke liye bill kaa virodh karne vaale saansdo ko sadan se nikaalane ke liye pehali baar marshall kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 The BJP then passed the bill in the Rajya Sabha by supporting the UPA government on the Women's Reservation Bill
 loksabhaa main bijepi-congress kaa virohtatkaaleen congress saansad sandip dikshit or anya varisht congressi saansdo ne loksabhaa main bill kaa virodh kiya tha
 Gopinath Muday, the deputy leader of the party in the Lok Sabha and Ramesh Bais, the chief whip of the party from the BJP, openly opposed the Women's Reservation Bill and put the party leadership in trouble
 mahilaon ke mudde par siyasat kaa ruukh bhaanpate hue rahul gandhi ne ek phir se mahila aarakshan kaa mudda garma kar rajnatik faaydaa uthaane kii koshish he
 But the Modi government has curbed the efforts of Rahul Gandhi by linking women's reservation with issues like triple talaq, halala, nikah

 kuch din pehle bandiyon ne unki jamkar pitayee kii thi
 In the last year and a half, 23 prisoners have died in this prison alone
 rajya kii jele arajak kyon hoti ja rahi hai? iske do fori jawaab hai
 First, there are more prisoners than the total capacity of the jails and second, the acute shortage of prison officials and staff to supervise the prisoners
 pradesh ke jail vibhaag main ek adarsh karagaar, 5 kendriya karagaar, 51 jila karagaar, 3 upakaragaar, 1 kishor sadan (bareli), 1 nari bandi niketan (lakhanu) samet kul 62 karagaar hai
 Except for Naini, only the convicted prisoners are kept in the Central Prison, Adarsh prison in Lucknow, Nari Bandi Niketan, and Kishore Sadan of Bareilly
 naini or duusare sabhi jila or upakaragaron main vichaaradhin bandi bhi rakhe jate hai
 These jails have a capacity to hold a total of 47,048 prisoners but 77,584 prisoners are kept here
 vishesh or kendriya jelon ke alaava kuch nai bani jelon ko nikaal den to zyaadaatar jelon main kshamta se dogune kaidi hai
 Now another aspect: There are a total of 10,400 posts of officers / employees in the prisons of the state, out of which more than 1,800 posts of detainees are vacant
 yahi nahin, lambey samay se bhartee prakriya ke band hone ke kaaran jail adhikshakon ke bhi 25 pad khaali pade hai
 Former Director General of Police Yashpal Singh explains that "the reason for this chaos is the poor monitoring system of prisons

 Last year, Dr
 Mehrut posted in the hospital of the jail
 harpal kii jail ke baahar goli maar kar isliye hatya kar di gai kyonki unhone do khoonkhaar kaidiyon ke man mutabik medical report banane se manaa kar diya tha
 That is why no doctor wants to go to a jail hospital

 This is the reason that every year about 500 prisoners die in state jails due to illness

 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kaalicharan saraaf guuruuvaar ko apane ilaake malviya nagar ke ward number 57-58 ke vikaas kaaryon ko lekar dharna de rahe the
 During the protest, Saraf said that if the government officials do not listen to them, then they know to do the work on the strength of the shoes
 malviya nagar ke bijepi vidhayak kaalicharan saraaf ke is bayaan ko lekar congress ne aapatti jataate hue kaha he ki sarkari karmchaariyon or adhikariyon ko is tarah se khuleam dhamkaana thik nahin he
 Kalicharan Saraf alleges that the filling of water around the Kartarpura drain makes people's lives difficult
 magar sarkaar sun nahin rahi he
 Officials repeatedly say that we have made a plan and sent it up
 agar isi tarah se kaamon ko taalte rahe to ham juute kii jor par kaam karaayenge
 The disputed statement of former BJP minister Kalicharan Saraf has been condemned by Congress leaders
 kaalicharan saraaf ne apane bayaan main kaha tha ki jab bhaajapa kaa shashan tha tab vah kalam se kaam karte the or jab vipaksh main hai to juute ke bal par kaam karavaate hai
 State Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma has condemned this statement, saying that this statement shows that while in government, it was not only corruption through pen but also promoted institutional corruption
 pradesh congress mahasachiv roopesh kaant vyas ne is bayaan kii ninda karte hue kaha ki loktantric prakriya main is tarah ke vivaadon se bachanaa chahie
 This statement shows the dictatorial mindset of BJP leaders

 There are many decisions that are very good to hear, it seems that yes it is right but rather good
 lekin kya un faislon se phayda bhi utana hi hota he jitna sunne main lagate hai
 In India, the budget has been starting from April 1 for 150 years
 ise british parampara ke taur par pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 Now the government wants to create a new financial year from January 1 and Madhya Pradesh has also joined this decision of the Center
 andhra pradesh ne bhi hami bhar di he
 So there is going to be a competition, so it is important that we also think about this decision

 kya angrezi calendar ke hisaab se vitt varsh kaa paalan karnaa sahi he
 In 1582, Pope Gregory started the calendar running from January 1
 bharat main bhi anek calendar hai or naye saal ko lekar ham alag alag maheenon main jashn manaate hai, apane bahikhaaton kii safai dhulaai karte hai
 Whenever Diwali happens in Gujarat in october-november, we celebrate the new year, during which people keep new books and assimilate the old
 bestu baras kehete hai
 In Bengal, the new year begins on Poila Baisakh, which falls on 13, 14 or 15 April
 vahaan ke vyapaaree is din nayaa bahikhaata karidate hai
 Gudi Padwa is celebrated in march-april in Maharashtra
 punjab main 13 april ko baisakhi padati he, is din vahaan ke vyapaaree nayaa bahikhaata apanaate hai
 The amazing thing is that by following the government fiscal year, our traders never left the Indian tradition
 balki in dinon ek april ko nav sanvatsar manaane kii parampara tej hui he
 This day is being popularized as compared to Happy New Year on January 1
 raja vikram ne isaki buniyaad daali thi
 We call it Vikram Samvat
 aadhakirik rup main bharat main shaq calendar ko manyata di gai he
 According to this, suspicion is going on in 1939 but many organizations are busy propagating the Vikram Samvat
 is vakt vikrami samvath 2074 chal rahaa he
 Vikram Samvat March begins with Chait Shukla Paksha Pratipada falling in April
 is saal yah tithi 28 march ko padi thi
 The date may not be fixed but the budget starting from April 1 is very close to the Indian tradition
 is taarikh ko hameshaa british parampara ke chashme se hi kyon dekha jaataa rahaa he
 Why didn't we consider it Indian which is very close to the social traditions of an agricultural country like India
 pashchimi calendar se shuru hone vaala nayaa saal aadhi raat se aata he, jabaki pratipada kaa nayaa saal suryoday se shuru hota he
 Surprisingly, why the government emphasizing the Indian traditions is adopting the fiscal year according to the Gregorian calendar
 april se shuru hone vaala bajet parampara or kheti ke sizan ke anukool bhi he
 Why it was seen through the spectacles of British tradition itself
 magar sarkaar ne itnaa bada faisla paramparaon ke hisaab to nahin kiya hoga balki aarthik napha nuksaan kaa hi khyaal rakhaa gaya hoga
 It is being argued that the financial year from April 1 to March 31 of the next year was not benefiting as much as it should have
 kya ham thik thik jaanate hai ki ye utana yaa itnaa kitna he
 Today Shaji Vikraman in Indian Express in this context or hindustan akhbaar main harjinder ne lekh likhaa he
 The article of these two different authors felt that this decision has no special benefit

 America's central fiscal year of dreams and frustrations begins from October 1
 america rajyon ke vitt varsh alag alag tarikhon se shuru hote hai
 The fiscal year of Russia and China starts from January 1
 brazil, france, greece kaa vitt varsh ek janvari se hota he
 There are many countries whose fiscal year is not from January 1
 kai desh aise hai jinke vitt varsh july se shuru hote hai or kuch ke april se
 That is, there is no universally accepted pattern of starting the financial year from January 1 all over the world
 ejipt, bangladesh, australia or pakistan kaa vitt varsh ek july se shuru hota he
 The fiscal year of South Africa, Hong Kong, Britain and Canada starts from April 1
 aap kah sakate hai ki zyaada deshon kaa vitt varsh ek janvari se shuru hota he
 april-march, july-june and september-august are also seen as fiscal years
 ek janvari se shuru hone vaale vitt varsh kaa ek laabh to dikhataa he ki march lut samaapt ho jaaegi magar kya pataa disambar lut kaa chalan shuru ho jaae
 There has been a demand in India for the financial year january-december since the 1950s, but no concrete decision could be taken on this
 kai cametiyon ne report di he magar kuch hua nahin
 The Modi government also formed the Shankar Acharya Committee
 ab yah saaf nahin he ki us cameti ke hisaab se faisla ho rahaa he yaa faisla ho chukaa he
 There is a constitutional body which we know as the CAG, to keep an eye on the government account independently
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 150 ke anusaar sangh ke or rajyon ke lekhaon ko aise praaroop main rakhaa jayega jo raashtrapati bharat ke niyantrak mahalekhapareekshak kii salaah ke anuroop ho
 The comments ham nahin jaanate hai ki lekha jekha kaa jo praaroop he, formet he usamen niyantrak mahalekhapareekshak yani sieji kii kitni raay yaa sahmati he
 The date is not mentioned in the article
 sarkaar sirf taarikh badalane kii baat kar rahi he
 Do not change the format
 7 april 2017 ke bijness standard main chhapi khabar ke anusaar vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki ham vitt varsh badalane kii report kaa adhyayan kar rahe hai
 The financial year of the world is according to the needs of our country, we are following the old British tradition
 vitt mantri jetali shankar ayyar cameti ke sandarbh main yah baat kar rahe the, jise iske bare main adhyayan karne kaa kaam diya gaya he
 That is, until April 7, the Center had not decided about the new fiscal year
 23 april ravivaar ke din dilli main niti ayog kii garvaning council kii baithak hui
 In this meeting, Prime Minister Modi emphasized on adopting a new financial year keeping in mind the interests of farmers
 media kii report se to nahin lagata ki sarkaar ne abhi tak janvari-disambar vitt varsh ke bare main faisla kar liya
 So you are naturally curious that how Madhya Pradesh decided before the Center
 kya madhya pradesh ne bhi kisi cameti kii report ke aadhaar par faisla kiya he
 The central government definitely wants to start the financial year from january-december instead of april-march, but before its decision, this decision of Madhya Pradesh seems quite interesting and encouraging
 gujarat main oktober november main jab bhi diwaali hoti he, nayaa varsh manaate hai, isi dauraan log nae bahikhaate rakhte hai or puraane ko samet dete hai

 Baisakhi falls on 13 April in Punjab, on this day, the merchants adopt new bookkeeping
 kamaal yah he ki sarkari vitt varsh kaa paalan karte hue hamaare vyapaariyon ne kabhi bhartiya parampara ko nahin choda
 Rather these days, the tradition of celebrating the New Year on April 1 has intensified
 is din ko ek janvari vaale happy new year ke mukaable lokapriy banya ja rahaa he
 King Vikram laid the foundation for this
 ham ise vikram samvath kehete hai
 The Saka calendar has been recognized in India as a half-way
 iske anusaar shaq 1939 chal rahaa he lekin kai sanghathan vikrami samvath ko prachaarit karne main lage rahete hai
 Currently Vikrami Samvat 2074 is going on
 vikrami samvath march april main padane vaali chait shukla paksh pratipada se shuru hota he
 This year, the date fell on 28 March
 taarikh bhale na tay ho lekin ek april se shuru hone vaala bajet bhartiya panrapara ke kaaphi kareeb he
 Why this date has always been seen through spectacles of British tradition
 hamane ise hi bhartiya kyon nahin mana jo bharat jaise krishi pradhan desh kii saamaajik paramparaon ke bilkul qareeb he
 The new year starts from midnight, while the new year of Pratipada starts from sunrise, starting from the western calendar
 hairaani kii baat he ki bhartiya panraparaaon par jor dene vaali sarkaar gragarian calendar ke hisaab se vitt varsh kyon apana rahi he
 The budget starting in April is also in line with the tradition and farming season
 ise british parampara ke chashme se hi kyon dekha gaya
 But the government may not have made such a big decision according to the traditions, but the economic loss would have been taken into consideration
 tark diya ja rahaa he ki ek april se lekar agle saal 31 march tak ke vitt varsh se utana phayda nahin ho rahaa tha jitna hona chahie
 Do we know exactly how much or how much
 aaj is sandarbh main indian express main shaji vikraman And Harjinder has written an article in Hindustan newspaper
 in donon alag alag lekhakon ke lekh se laga ki is faisle kaa koi khaas phayda nahin he
 It is being said that it is a good and practical decision, but it sounds good to see, it is not going to benefit as much as it is being told

 The fiscal year of Egypt, Bangladesh, Australia and Pakistan starts from July 1
 dakshin africa, hong kong, britain or canada kaa vitt varsh ek april se shuru hota he
 You can say that the financial year of most countries starts from January 1
 april-march, july-june or sintabar-agast bhi vitt varsh ke rup main dekhe jate hai
 One benefit of the financial year that starts from January 1 is that the March loot will end, but do you know if the December loot will start trending? bharat main 1950 ke dashak se hi vitt varsh janvari-disbanr karne kii maang uthati rahi he magar is par koi thos faisla nahin ho sakaa

 bhartiya vayusena (indian air force) kii is badi karrwai par videsh sachiv vijay gokhale ne kaha ki 14 farvari ko jaish e mohammad ne siarpief par fidaayin hamalaa kiya tha
 This organization has been active in Pakistan for two decades

 Attacked 12 Mirage fighter jets at 30 minutes and targeted three terrorist camps
 bhartiya vayusena ne balakot, chakot or mujaffarabad milakar kul teen hamale kiye
 It is also being told that the terrorist camps of Jaish, Lashkar and Hizbul were also involved in it, which was destroyed by the Indian Air Force
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, bhartiya vayusena ke is hamale main aatanki camp puri tarah se tabah ho gaye hai

 Opposition not united: The result of the election is clear that the opposition in Karnataka was not united against the BJP
 jedisane 15 main se 12 siton par apane ummidavaar utaare
 In the triangular fight in these 12 seats, secular votes were divided between the Congress and the JDS and the BJP benefited from it
 jaisaa ki may 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav main or ateet ke anya chunaavon main hua ho chukaa he, vipaksh ne apni pichhali bhuulon par gaur nahin kiya or ekajute hokar nahin ladaa
 Therefore BJP won
 sakriy nahin dikhe kumaraswamiupachunaav main purv mukhyamantri kumaraswami utane sakriy nahin dikhe jitna unhen vidhansabha chunaav main dekha gaya
 This is the reason that the JDS campaigning also fell behind and the JDS, which contested 12 seats on 5 December, could not win a single seat
 gathbandhan ke apane purv saathi congress se alag hokar jedies ne khud ke dam par ek darjan seat par sattarudh bijepi or congress ke khilaaf chunaav ladaa tha
 The JDS, which won 36 seats in the assembly elections held in May 2018, came to power after 12 years in alliance with the Congress and Kumaraswamy became the chief minister of the state for the second time, but this time he has to remain empty handed

 Govind Malviya, a diploma in electronics engineering, has claimed to have designed a formula whereby the motorcycle runs on hydrogen instead of petrol
 vah is formule se hydrogen se motor cycle chalaa bhi rahe hai
 According to Govind, the engine of the motorcycle is powered by petrol, but after the car starts, the pipe of the petrol tank is closed and it is connected to the adjacent cylinder
 unhone bataaya ki is silendar main aluminium tathaa sodium hydroaksaide kaa mishran rahata he tathaa is mishran main boond
 
 boond pani giraaya jaataa he, jisase hydrogen gas banati he or yahi gadee ko aage badhaane kaa kaam karti he
 Govind said that adding two liters of water to a mixture of two kilograms of aluminum and sodium hydroxide produces 200 grams of hydrogen, which can drive a motorcycle for about one hundred kilometers
 hydrogen se motor cycle chalaane ko ‘eco friendli’ bataate hue govind ne bataaya ki is samoochee prakriya main paryaavaran ko pradooshit karne vaali koi gas nahin nikalati
 Only steam comes out, which turns cold when it is cold and there is no harm to the environment
 govind ne bataaya ki hydrogen ke silendar se baahar aane ke baad use thanda karne vaale ek upkaran se guzaara jaataa he, jisase uskaa taapmaana shunya se neeche 106 degree ho jaataa he or hydrogen gas taral avasthaa main aa jaati he
 At that stage, he is introduced into the cabaret through a jet
 unhone bataaya ki kabrerator main 99 pratishat hawa or ek pratishat hydrogen kaa mishran blaak main aata he, jahaan spark ignishan ke kaaran mishran main teevr visphot hota he, jisase piston ko dhakka lagata he tathaa yahi kram aage chalata rahata he
 Govind told that he had been working on this scheme for two years and without any government facility, he completed this feat
 unhone bataaya ki is par lagbhag das hajaar rupee kaa kharch aayaa he
 He said that he is also working on a plan to drive a three wheeler with the help of cow dung gas and sulfuric acid and it is expected to be completed soon
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab govind ne kuch ajooba kiya ho
 Even before this, he has created a device called Solar Construction to generate electricity from air and water
 is upkaran se vah hawa, pani or aluminium ke buraade tathaa castic soda ke mishran se urja paidaa kar chuke hai
 They said that they are still working ahead on this project and after its completion in about two months, electricity can also be provided to any one village with a population of five hundred

 film aakiri baar guuruuvaar ko maratha mandir main subah sava nau baje dikhaai gai
 It is the longest running film in any theater in Indian history

e
 Shahrukh and Kajol attended
 500 hafton tak film ne box ofis par 200 karod kii kamai kii thi
 For the coming 1000 weeks, only a few crores were added to the figures, but the film was not being removed from the Maratha temple for the public demand and the Yash Raj banner to complete 1000 weeks
 par ab theatre or yashraj ke aapasi sahmati se film ko theatre se hataaya gaya he
 One of the most successful films of all time, hidden behind the making of Ek Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, is the hard work of the stars and the strenuous dedication of Aditya Chopra, son of Yash Chopra, who made his directorial debut with DDLJ
 400 se zyaada logon kii team ne DDLJ kii neenv daali thi
 Now the Maratha temple in Mumbai is waiting for another film to compete with DDLJ

 At the same time, if the seats are compromised then the Congress may get a shock
 duusari ore agar congress in dalon ke saath milakar agar chunaav ladati he to pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke liye rahul gandhi ke naam par aasaani se sahmati ban jaaegi, isse bhi andeh ke badal mandara rahe hai kyonki mamata banerjee ke manch se saaf kaha gaya he ki pradhanmantri koun hoga yah baad main tay kar lenge

 The state's BJP government has been carrying out several welfare schemes for the Scheduled Castes for years, but this class felt that the word Dalit in government documents used to defy their honor
 isliye is shabd ko nikaal baahar phenkaa jaae
 CM Raman Singh, in the last phase of his third term, immediately issued an order to keep this class within the BJP by showing the word Dalit out
 congress ne kaha, yah votbank kii raajnneetiudhar, bijepi sarkaar kaa yah faisla congress ko raas nahin aa rahaa

 Now that the assembly elections have come, the party is worried about the respect of this class
 unhone kaha ki yah raman singh kii sochi samajhi soshal ejineering he, lekin bijepi ko iskaa phayda nahin hone vaala

 Annoyed with the statement made by Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi about Bihar, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, in retaliation, advised Modi to take over his house and said that he (modi) should first see his side
 iske saath hi nitish ne modi ko bihar par tippanee na karne kii salaah dete hue kaha ki bihar apni kamajoriyon se ladate hue vikaas kii raah par aage bad rahaa he
 Nitish also said that we do not comment on others, so if no one else comments on Bihar, it will be good
 ullekhneey he ki rajkot main hui bhaajapa kaaryakarini kii do-divasiy baithak ke samaapan satr ke dauraan ravivaar ko apane sambodhan main modi ne kaha tha ki bihar ke netaaon dwaara jatigat raajnneeti kiye jane ke kaaran yah pradesh pichad gaya
 Modi was pulled by the ruling Janata Dal (united) and opposition party Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar for this statement
 bihar vidhanparishad ke sadsy or jad (you) ke pradesh pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne kaha ki modi abhi apni party or gujarat ke bahut saare andruni sankaton se jujh rahe hai, so, aise main vah apane man ke bhav pragat nahin kar rahe hai, balki kahin par nigahen, kahin par nishaanaa laga rahe hai
 Neeraj said that before saying such a thing, Modi should take care that his party is also included in the government here
 niraj ne kaha ki gujarat ko aadharbhoot sanrachana viraasat main mili or bihar kaa adhikansh hissaa baadh or sukhaad se prabhavit rahaa, parantu uske baavjood pradesh ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii kaarykushalta ke boote yahaan badi uplabdhiyaan hasil kii gayi

 unhone kaha ki bihar main jatigat bandhan toote hai
 There were 115 massacres here, which are now closed and there has been an atmosphere of social harmony and communal harmony, some people do not like it
 niraj ne kaha ki nitish aksar kaha karte hai ki saamaajik samarasata evam sampradayik sauhaard hamaari puunji hai or bihar kii 10 karod janata kaa maanav shram he, jisaki badaulat bihar vikaas kar rahaa he or aisa hi bihar main satta main shaamil modi ji kii party bhaajapa ke log bhi kehete hai
 He said that people keep making rhetoric, but the Chief Minister believes in Karma, and is trying to take a sick state like Bihar towards the developed state, this is being accepted by the country and the world
 tippaniyan Asked about Modi's statement about the murder of the banned caste organization Brahmeshwar Mukhiya in Bihar and then his supporters linked to the incidents of sabotage and arson, Neeraj said that if the situation is evaluated, the police would have taken action that day So the social harmony established in the villages with great difficulty could have deteriorated
 unhone kaha ki bihar sarkaar ne sanyam se kaam liya or yah nirnay bhi liya ki jin logon ne bhi us dauraan updrav kiya tha, unhen chihnit kar spidi trial karaayaa jayega, jisase bhavishya main koi aisi himmat nahin kar sake
 At the same time, Nitish advised Modi not to comment on Bihar and said that Bihar is moving forward on the path of development while fighting its weaknesses
 nitish ne yah bhi kaha ki ham dusron par tippanee nahin karte, so, koi or bhi bihar par tippanee na kare to acha hoga
 It is noteworthy that in his address on Sunday during the concluding session of the two-day meeting of the BJP executive held in Rajkot, Modi said that the state fell behind due to caste politics by the leaders of Bihar

 Member of Bihar Legislative Council and JD (U) State Spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said that Modi is still struggling with his party and a lot of internal crises in Gujarat, so in this case he is not expressing his heart, but somewhere But eyes are targeting somewhere
 niraj kaa kahana tha ki ki aisi baat kehane se purv modi ko dhyaan rakhana chahie ki yahaan unki party bhi sarkaar main shaamil he
 Neeraj said that Gujarat inherited the infrastructure and most of Bihar was affected by floods and drought, but despite that due to the efficiency of the Chief Minister of the state, Nitish Kumar, great achievements were made here
 niraj ne kaha ki desh ke aarthik aankadon ne sabit kar diya he ki bihar jaisaa bimaaru rajya vikaas dar or prati vyakti aay ke maamle main gujarat se bahut aage he or bihar kaa jo gauravpurn itihaas purv main rahaa he, yah usee disha main badhata hua kadam he

 rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav kii bisaat bich chuki he or partiyon ne apane sipaahi bhi ran main utaar die hai
 Many current ministers are also trying their luck once again in this political battle
 lekin rajasthan main ek aisa sanyog he, jisaki vajah se chunaav nateezon ke din sabaki nigahen maujuuda khel mantri kii seat par bhi rahati he
 Gajendra Singh Khivansar is the Sports and Forest Minister of the state in Rajasthan, who is an MLA from Lohawat
 darasal,rajasthandi siyasat main aisa mana jaataa he ki jo maujuuda khel mantri hota he, wo bhale hi kitna diggaj ho use haar kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 This has been happening for the last several years and every time the Sports Minister loses in the electoral field
 saal 2003 main ai vasundhara sarkaar ke kaarykaal main do khel mantri banaae to un donon ko hi haar naseeb hui
 Know when this has been happening and which leaders have become witnesses of it
 
 
 maangilaal garsiamangilaal garsia ke udaipur kii gogunda seat se teen baar chunaav jeet chuke hai or 2008 main ve pradesh ke khel mantri the
 In 2013 too, he came to the field with the experience of being an MLA three times, but had to lose the election to Pratap Bhil
 is haar ke saath hi yah myth sach sabit hua
 Yunus Khan Before this, Yunus Khan was number
 unuus khan 2003 main pehali barvidhansabhapahunche or unhen vasundhara sarkaar main khel mantri banaaya gaya
 However, he was not Sports Minister for the entire five years and after that Pratap Singh Singhvi was made Sports Minister
 wo bhale hi kuch maheene khel mantri rahe, lekin 2008 main unhen haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Pratap Singh Singhvi, Sundara Raje was appointed Sports Minister after Yunus Khan in the 2003 government
 pradesh ke diggaj netaaon main se ek singhvi par bhi khel mantri kaa 'kaala jaadu' chal gaya or unhen bhi 2008 main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Presently, Pratap Singh Singhvi is an MLA from Chhabra of Baran
 master bhanvaralalamaster bhanvaralaal congress ke varisht netaaon main se ek he
 In 1998, the Congress won and the Congress formed the government under the leadership of Ashok Gehlot
 gahalot sarkaar main hi master bhanvaralaal ko khel vibhaag kaa jimmaa diya gaya
 But due to this, Bhanwarlal had to face defeat in the next election
 bataa den ki congress netaashk ali taankke saath bhi aisa hua tha, jab 1985 main ve fatehpur se vidhayak bane to unhen khel mantri banaaya gaya tha, lekin agle chunaav main hi janata ne unpar bharosa nahin kiya
 This time, this myth has to be faced by Gajendra Singh Khivansar, see whether this sequence continues now or the sports minister's game also goes on in politics

 Predicting the mid-term assembly elections, Siddaramaiah asked the Congress workers to start preparations for the election and strengthen the party

 If they formed a government with the help of rebels (17 mlas disqualified from congress-jd (S)), could it last long? i don't think they will be able to stay for even a year
 ''siddharamaiya ne kaha ki yadi ve (bhaajapa) ek saal tak bhi sarkaar chalaa lete hai to yah badi cheez hogi
 He asked how long the BJP with 105 mlas would be able to remain in government

 People will teach them a lesson

 And when only the Chief Minister of a state starts giving hoodoo license to people, then who has the power to stop these goons roaming in disguise of Kanwari
 ye to kuch aisa hi he ki jab sainyaa bhale kotwaal to dar kaahe kaa
 Put fire in the world and say proudly that we are Kanwaris

 Bholenath is well aware of his good faith
 varanaa ek desh
 How can there be such a difference between those who believe in one religion and one tradition, that even God himself may be confused about whom he is worshiping
 kaanvadiyon or gundon main kya fark?ek kanwad bihar se hai jo shrawani meley main sultanganj se devgarh tak sava sau kimi tak kandhe par kanvad lekar nikalate hai or kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalata
 And this is that one
 
 When they leave, it seems as if the doom is about to come
 puri dilli, upi or uttarakhand dar dar kar chalane lagati he or ve seenaa taan kar
 It is as if Bholenath himself has got the road registry registered in his name
 inke raste main aana to dur kii baat bas koi inhen chhu bhar de to phir dekhie ye kya karte hai
 Who are these lawless people in front of the goons
 kahaan se aate hai or kyon har saal maheene bhar tak ke liye sabko daraa jate hai? maan bhi len ki ye coundie hai
 So are the Kanvandis like this? jo sadak par chalem or koi chhu bhar de to utpaat machaa den
 These are not goons, they are goons
 jo kanoon ko apni jootiyon kaa talla samajhakar masal dete hai
 And the law itself is helpless

 This incident is not about any street crossing or village countryside
 balki ye rajdhani dilli he
 Where there is no place to put sesame on the roads during office hours
 or us par kaanvadiyon ke naam par huddang karne vaale ye kuch gunde sadak ke bichobich chal rahe the
 The crowd was more
 kisi coundiye se car bas chhu bhar gai
 Then these goons ravaged that car
 chakanachur kar di karitani jaraa si baat par coundiyon ke naam par gundon kaa jattha tut padaa
 First one came and then the other
 phir teesraa
 Fourth
 ek ek karke coundiyon kii shakl main puraa kaa puraa gundon kaa dal pagal ho gaya
 It rained the poles on the car and blew away the car
 kisi ne car kaa bonut todaa
 Someone's mirror
 kisi ne daravaaza or jab car ko chakanachur kar chuke or todane ke liye kuch nahin bachaa to car ko hi uthaa ke palat diya
 Delhi policewoman kept watching the spectacle of the goons when she was representing her hooliganism
 us vakt maukey par dilli police ke sipaahi maujuud the
 But in front of these insurgents, they also laid down their arms
 unki himmat nahin ho rahi thi ki wo apane saamne ho rahi gundgardee ko roak saken
 How are you? kaanvadibia hone ke naam par inhen hinsa kaa license jo mila hua tha
 What has been there now is politics
 jo coundiyon ke bhes main gundon ko gundgardee kaa license de rahi he
 Because in Baba's faith, leaders found an opportunity for politics
 har saal bad rahi he kaavdiyon kii gundgardeelgataar har saal kaanvadiyon kii gundgardee ke maamle badhate ja rahe hai or siyasat he ki niyam banaakar in par nakel kasne ke bajaae inamen bhi vot paane ke maukey khojati he
 And now when politics has entered the faith
 to aap bhi aadat daal lijie
 Now vehicles will also be broken
 raste bhi jam honge
 And will also wreak havoc

 The prime minister's intention behind this slogan is to curb the hostility in the name of caste, religion and language in the country
 unako ummid he ki deshavaasiyon par iskaa asar hoga or halaat sudharenge
 But the latest situation in Karnataka is questioning Prime Minister Modi's plans

 The real reason is that this language fight in Karnataka state, created on the basis of linguistic basis, is just an attempt to prepare the ground for next year's assembly elections
 kyonki agar desh kaa samvidhan anuchhed 350 (k) ke tahat rajya ko apni maatrubhaasha ko samrudh karne kaa adhikaar detaa he to usee samvidhan ke bheetar anuchhed 351 main prantiy bhashaaon kii madad se hindi bhashaa ke sanvardhan kii baat bhi kahi gai he
