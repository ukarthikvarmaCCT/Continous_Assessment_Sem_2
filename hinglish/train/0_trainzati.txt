 The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court will now hear the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act which ends the twenty-year-old collegium system for appointment of judges in the Supreme Court and High Court

 yachika main kaha gaya ki isse nyaayadhishon kii niyukti main karypalika kaa dakhal badhegaa jisase nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa or nishpakshta prabhavit hogi
 During the hearing, the central government had justified this in the court, saying that the Supreme Court can hear the matter right now because the notification has not been issued for it
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki nyaayik niyukti ayog kanoon or 121waan samvidhan sanshodhan kanoon nirast kiya jaae, kyonki isse supreme court or hoicourt main nyaayadhishon kii niyukti main karypalika kaa hastkshep badhata he, jo na sirf nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa ko baadhit karata he balki samvidhan ke mul dhaanche ko bhi prabhavit karata he jisamen swatantra nyaaypalika kii baat kahi gai he

 Section 5 (6) of the law says that if two members of the commission do not agree to appoint someone, then the commission will not recommend the appointment of that person
 yachikakarta kaa kahana he ki iskaa sidhaa matlab he ki mukhya nyaayadhish ke najariye ko nazarandaaj kiya ja saktaa he, jabaki supremecourt kii nau nyaayadhishon kii samvidhan peeth edwocket on ricard maamle main kah chuki he ki nyaayadhishon kii niyukti main mukhya nyaayadhish kii raay nazarandaaj nahin kii ja sakati, jabaki nae kanoon ke mutabik ayog kaa alp samooh (do sadsy) aisa kar sakate hai

 In this way, the doors of mutual electoral understanding have been kept open

 On the demand of some delegates to hold secret ballot in protest against the official draft political proposal, Karat said that this is an unexpected demand
 party congress main is tarah kii paripati kabhi nahin rahi he
 The former party general secretary and politburo member, however, said that it would depend on our Congress
 congress makapa main nirnay karne vaala sarvocch nikaay he
 Karat said, 'so far in our party Congress there is no example of secret vote on any proposal
 aisa kabhi nahin hua he

 He referred to the recent peasant movement in Maharashtra
 unhone kaha ki makapa kii kisaan shakha akhil bhartiya kisaan sabha party line se itar sabhi kisaanon ko ekajute karne main kaamyaab rahi
 Yechury said that if the party differentiates between secular parties, BJP will take advantage of this opportunity
 unki raay ko kal or aaj charchaa ke dauraan kai rajyon ke pratinidhiyon se samarthan mila
 The important issue in this is whether the CPI-M should join hands with 'all secular and democratic forces', including the Congress, to compete with the BJP

 The Pal couple living in the metropolis have been working day and night in the treatment of daughter Sumona Pal for the past 9 years
 sumona wilson disease se peedit hai jisamen nervas system ke prabhavit hone kii vajah se mastishk se sharir ke anya angon ko nirdesh nahin ja pate
 The treatment of Sumona costs one and a half lakh rupees every month
 sumona ke pita ek choti printing press chalaate hai jisase har maheene mushkil 20,000 rupee kii hi aamadani ho paati he
 The Pal couple have invested all their savings in the treatment of their daughter
 iske alaava karibiyon or anya se milane vaali madad bhi paal danpati ke liye bada sahaara he
 For the treatment of Sumona, a bottle of 100 capsules comes to 600 pounds
 har maheene do bottle kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The company that manufactures these capsules provides it free of cost to the Pal family
 lekin iske alaava bhi sumona ke ilaaj par badi rakam kharch hoti he
 The troubles of the crisis couple in treatment of demonetisation have increased after the decision of demonetisation on 8 November
 ab unhen beti ke ilaaj ke liye nakadi ke sankat kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he

 jin anjaan logon ne kabhi sumona kii sud nahin lee thi wo paal parivaar ke paas madad kii peshkash lekar aae
 But even in this help, his own selfishness was hidden
 unhone kaha ki paal parivaar unka kaala dhan le kar rakh le or use safed main badal kar baad main waapas kar de
 In return, keep a certain portion of this amount as commission for the treatment of Sumona
 paal parivaar ne aise logon ko ghar kaa darwaja dikhaane main ek minute kii bhi der nahin lagaai
 The Pal family is unsure how some people can fall for their benefit and they do not care about the feelings of others

 Vat Savitri Vrat 2019: vat savitri vrath (vat Savitri Vrat) hindu dharm ko maanane vaali striyon ke liye behad khaas he
 It is believed that keeping this fast increases the distress faced by the husband and prolongs his life
 yahi nahin agar daanpaty jivan main koi pareshaani chal rahi ho to vah bhi is vrath ke pratap se dur ho jate hai
 Suhagin women pray for the long life of their husbands and happy marital life and worship on this day under Vat i
e
 Banyan tree
 is din savitri (savitri) or satyawan (satyavan) kii katha sunne kaa vidhaan he
 It is believed that by listening to this story one gets the desired fruit
 puranic katha ke anusaar savitri mrityu ke devtaa yamraj se apane pati satyawan ke praan waapas le ai thi
 Savitri was a girl with all the qualities, for which Savitri's father started grieving because of not getting a suitable groom
 ek baar unhone putree ko swayan var talashne bheja
 In this search, Savitri arrives in a forest where she meets the King of the Salve country, Dumatsen
 dyumtsen usee tapovana main rahete the kyonki unka rajya kisi ne chin liya tha
 Savitri, seeing her son Satyavan, selected her as her husband
 idhar, yah baat jab rishiraj naarad ko gyaat hui to ve ashwapati se jaakar kehane lage- aapaki kanya ne var khojane main baari bhul kii he
 Satyavan is virtuous and righteous but he is young and will die after one year
 naarad ji ke vachan sun raja ashwapati kaa cheharaa vivarna ho gaya
 Considering "vratha na hohin dev sage bani", he explained to his daughter that it is not appropriate to marry such a young person
 isliye anya koi var chun lo
 On this, Savitri tells her father that the father-arya girls remember their husband only once, and Kanyadaan is also done only once
 ab chaahe jo ho, main satyawan ko hi var rup main sweekaar kar chuki hum
 Hearing this, both of them were married with ritualistic rituals and Savitri got engaged in the service of mother-in-law as soon as she reached her in-law's house
 samay badla, naarad kaa vachan savitri ko din -pratidin adheer karne laga
 When she realized that the day of her husband's death had drawn near, then she started fasting from three days ago
 naarad dwaara kathith nishchit tithi par pitaron kaa pujan kiya
 As usual, Satyavan went to cut wood on his own time that day, Savitri also agreed to walk in the forest with her husband on the orders of her mother-in-law
 satyawan van main pahunchakar lakdi kaatane ke liye vriksh par chadh gaya
 Ascending the tree, Satyavan's head started suffering unbearable pain
 vah vyakul ho gaya or vriksh se neeche utar gaya
 Savitri understood her future and made her husband sit on her lap and lie down on her husband
 usee samay dakshin disha se atyant prabhaavshaalee mahisharudh yamraj ko aate dekha
 When Dharmaraj walked with Satyavan's life, Savitri also followed him
 pehle to yamraj ne use devi-vidhaan samajhaayaa parantu uski nishtha or patiparayanata dekh kar use var maangane ke liye kaha
 Savitri said- "my mother-in-law is a forest dweller and blind
 unhen aap divya jyoti pradaan karen
 "yamraj said," This will happen and now you go back
 " yamraj kii baat sunakar usne kaha, "bhagwaan mujhe apane patidev ke peeche-peeche chalane main koi pareshaani nahin he
 It is my duty to follow the husband
 " yah sunakar unhone phir se use ek or var maangane ke liye kaha
 Savitri said, "the kingdom of our father-in-law has been snatched away so that they can regain it, and also remain virtuous
 " yamraj ne yah var dekar kaha, "acha ab tum laut jaao parantu vah na maani
 "yamraj said that in addition to the life of the husband, ask for whatever you want and return
 is baar savitri ne apane ko satyawan ke sau putron kii maa banane kaa vardaan maanga
 Yamraj said Aastastu and went ahead
 savitri phir bhi unke peeche-peeche chalati rahi
 Yamraj gets angry with this act of his
 yamraj ko krodhit hote dekh savitri unhen naman karte hue unhen kahati he, "aapane mujhe sau putron kii maa banane kaa aashirwad to de diya lekin bina pati ke main maa kis prakaar se ban sakati hum, isaliye aap apane tisare vardaan ko puraa karne ke liye apana kaha puraa karen
 "yamraj, knowing Savitri's husband's religion, freed Satyavan's life from his loop
 savitri satyawan ke praan lekar vat vriksh ke neeche pahunchi or satyawan jivit hokar uth baithe
 Both of them cheered and walked towards their capital
 vahaan pahunch kar unhone dekha ki unke mata-pita ko divya jyoti praapt ho gai he
 In this way savitri-satyavan continued to enjoy state happiness for a long time
 manyata he ki vat savitri vrath karne or isaki katha sunne se upaask ke vaivaahik jivan yaa jivan saathi kii aayu par kisi prakaar kaa koi sankat aayaa bhi ho to tal jaataa he

 puraa bollywood unako santvanaa de rahaa he lekin is maukey par salmaan khan peeche rahe hai
 Of course these days he is busy shooting for 'tiger Zinda Hai'
 lekin isaki vajah or bhi he
 It is said that his father was the reason for the end of Salman and Ash's love story
 kamai se lekar tex bharne tak main bollywood ke 'sultan' bane salmansalmaan ne khud bataai thi vajahamedia reports ke mutabik, salmaan khan ke dabang swabhaav ke chalate donon kaa rishta khatm hua tha
 In 2002, both of them openly accused each other and after this Salman Khan gave an explosive interview
 unhone brallep kaa kaaran aishwarya ke papa ko bataate hua kaha tha ki aishwarya ke pita mere bare main bilkul thik sochate the!mahabuuba mufti kii chahat- salmaan khan hon J-K ke brands ambesderkrishnaraj ko pasand nahin tha ye rishtaais baat kii bhi aksar charchaa hoti he ki aishwarya raay ke mata pita ko unka or salmaan khan kaa relationships nahin pasand tha
 The night Salman went to Aishwarya's house and made a lot of spectacle, which Ash gave in full detail in an interview
 'tiger jinda he' ke set se katrina-salmaan kii tasviren li!iske baad ek intervy main salmaan apni har galati ko maanate hue doosraa mauka maanga
 During this time, it was revealed that the main reason for their breakup was Salman's ill-will with Ash's father
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki meri life ke bare main jaanakar ve hamaara rishta nahin chaahate
 The Bachchan family arrived to pay tribute to the fourth of Aishwarya's father
 
 
 parivaar le aayaa tha donon main dooriyambataya jaataa he ki salmaan khan ne is intervyuu main mana tha ki aish ke saath rishta unhone apni bevakoofi kii vajah se kharaab kiya he
 For Ash, he said - Just as i will not dishonor my parents, in the same way Aishwarya will never want to do the same
 phir aisa koun-sa pita hoga jo apni beti ko aise ladke ke saath jane kii ijaajat degaa
 The hindu-muslim wall never stood in our midst, but i lost them due to my hasty nature in everything

 com / jlibxymbtd— ANI (@ani_news)september 15, 2016 Those who are advising Mahendra Singh Dhoni to retire, need to be reminded of some things due to the failure of others to perform in some World Cup matches
 2005 ke baad se lagaataar sachin tendulkar ko salaah di jaati rahi ki ve ritair ho jaaen
 After the 2007 World Cup, Sachin had almost decided that he would no longer play
 un teen maichon main ve bas 60-70 ran bana paae the
 But then Vivian Richards told him to keep playing, no need to listen
 sachin ne yah baat maani- vanade or test cricket ko milakar sau shatak puure kiye, 2011 kaa world cap team ke saath uthaaya or antat ek avishwasaneey cricket kareer puraa kar balla rakhaa
 If you want, you can go back some more
 1983 main mahaan ballebaaj sunil gavaskar ke bare main kaha gaya ki ve chuk gaye hai
 He could not play at all against Malcolm Marshall in the Kanpur Test against the West Indies
 unako bhi sanyas le lene kii salaah lagaataar di jaati rahi
 Sunil Gavaskar changed his stand in the Delhi Test
 ballebaaji kaa apana surakshatmak andaaz choda or gendbaazon kii jam kar pitayee kii
 He made a century in just 94 balls, which was very fast in terms of Test matches played in those days
 sambhawatah vah tab tak kisi salaami ballebaaz kii ore se lagaai gai sabase tej centuri bhi thi
 Not only this, he also equaled Don Bradman's 29 centuries with this century and a few days later he became the batsman to score the highest Test century by scoring 236 runs in the Madras Test
 unke 236 ran tab tak test maichon main bharat kii ore se ek pari ke sarvaadhik ran kaa record bhi the
 After 4 years, when Gavaskar hung the bat, by then he had completed more than ten thousand runs
 aise atireki udhaaharan or bhi hai jab khilaadiyon ko unke kareer ke bich hi sanyas lene kii salaah di jaati rahi
 Sourav Ganguly also felt that he was dropped from the team at a time when his game was good and better than others
 jahaan tak mahendra singh dhoni kaa sawaal he, is vishwa cap main bhi unka pradarshan bura nahin rahaa he
 He did not try to win in the last over against England - he is complaining a lot about this
 lekin hardik pandya ke out hone ke baad england kii dhardaar gendbaazi ke saamne jeet kii koshish karnaa harakiri karne ke baraabar hota
 Since in recent years we have started to think of such harakiri as a thrill of cricket, it is becoming difficult to digest that a batsman will continue to play on the condition of not losing a wicket and lose the match
 west indies ke kilaaf ek mushkil pich par mahendra singh dhoni ne jis tarah 56 ran banaae, vah bhi kaabile taareef tha
 Apart from Kohli, no other batsman played well on this wicket
 lekin dhoni se kuch or karne kii ummid unki aalochana kii vajah ban gai
 People forgot that the young batsmen Hardik Pandya and Rishabh Pant, who are considered to be the heroes of the batting batting, could not do any big magic in these matches apart from batting
 west indies ke kilaaf pandya kaa strike rate dhoni se bhi kam rahaa
 There is no doubt that Mahendra Singh Dhoni has slowed down compared to earlier
 unako aankh jamaane main samay lagata he
 But if Mahendra Singh Dhoni were only a batsman who made a big splash, his batting age would not have been so much
 ve apni peedi ke sabase sayaane cricketron main hai
 After the initial two-three years of tinkering, he has managed to develop his own grammar of batting
 yah anayas nahin he ki vanade maichon main 5000 se zyaada ran banane vaale ballebaajon main sabase zyada naabad paariyaan unke hi khate main hai
 He has been unbeaten 84 times, while Mark Beaven, who stood second in this case, has been unbeaten in 67 innings and Steve Waugh third in 58 innings
 dhoni match ko bilkul apane boote khatm karte rahe hai or isamen amuman unke 'calculation' kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 When he understood that the match went out of his hands, he has not shown the courage to forcibly spin a wicket
 lekin aise dher saare mauqe aae hai jab aakiri overon main khud apane kandhon par zimmedaari liye rahane ke liye unhone ek-ek ran chode hai or ant main lambey shot lagaakar lakshya hasil kiya he
 It is not that this is a very old story
 ulte beete ek baras se mahendra singh dhoni kaa balla jamkar bolta rahaa he
 In the year 2019, he has played 16 matches so far and his average in them has crossed 61
 viraat kohli ko chhod den to koi unke aasapaas nahin he
 It is being recalled that in 2007, it was Dhoni who advocated the gradual departure of the senior trinity of Indian cricket
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki 2007 ke dhoni hote to 2019 ke dhoni ko team se baahar kar dete
 But in 2007, Dhoni's argument was fitness and fielding
 kehane kii jarurat nahin ki is kasuti par dhoni aaj bhi khare utarate hai
 He is not only one of India's most fit and agile players, but also the best wicketkeeper
 dhoni 38 saal ke ho gaye hai
 He does not have many years left to play anyway
 bahut sambhav he, is vishwa cap ke baad ve khud sanyas le len
 He also left the Test matches very unexpectedly
 lekin jab tak dhoni aisa faisalaa nahin karte, unako hataane yaa unase sanyas le lene kii maang karne kaa koi auchity nahin he
 As a senior player who closely reads the game, he is helpful to Virat Kohli, his ability to turn the match at any time is still unquestionably higher than others
 lekin shaayad ham atiyon main jeene vaale cricket premi desh hai
 In this country, at least 25 Tests were played to allow Kapil Dev to make a world record of 432 wickets
 ab dhoni kii kuch naakaam paariyaan logon ko baari pad rahi hai

 ) The tradition of organizing 'dawat-e-iftar' by political parties on the holy month of Ramadan in Bihar is old
 lok janashakti party ke mukhiya or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne somvaar ko patna main daavat-e-iftaar kaa aayojan kiya jisamen bhartiya janata party or janata dal united ke netaa shaamil hue
 But before this, both BJP-JDU did not attend each other's Iftar party

 During this, everyone's face smiled while Ram Vilas Paswan's son Chirag Paswan also appeared together
 JDU kii iftaar party main BJP shaamil nahiin tasveeron or bihar main is saal yojit iftaar daawaton main donon gathbandhanon kii taraf se nae siyaasi paigaam aane lage hai
 Which is pointing towards the direction that something is not going well between the JDU-BJP in Bihar, because before this, iftar party, which was run by the jdu-run government in collaboration with the BJP, on Sunday, the former Chief Minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha Chief Jitan Ram Manjhi did join, but no BJP leader or MLA reached
 isse kai sawaalon ko hawa milane lagi he
 No one from JDU went to bjp's Iftar party, but all the BJP leaders arrived at the Iftar party organized by Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Sunday but angry with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's offer to give JDU a symbolic place in Union Cabinet No leader of the party JDU joined
 haalanki bijepi netaa susheel modi haalanki kehete hai ki yah ek dharmik aayojan he, iskaa raajnneetik arth nahin nikaala janaa chahie
 He once again reiterated that there is no dispute from anywhere in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
 gauratlab he ki jediu-bijepi ke bich talkhi kii shuruyaat tab shuru hui, jab narendra modi ke mantrimandal ke shapath grahan samaaroh ke kuch ghante pehle mukhyamantri ne jediu ko isamen sankethik rup se shaamil kiye jane ke 'ofer' ko thukaraate hue mantrimandal main shaamil nahin hone kii ghoshnaa kii
 CM Nitish Kumar had said that in future also she will not be a part of Modi government
 iske do din baad hi bihar main nitish kumaar ne apane mantrimandal kaa vistaar kiya, jisamen bijepi ke ek bhi vidhayak ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh wants to test the reality of changing times
 bharat ek hindu raashtra he
 Except this idea, the Sangh is ready for every change, whose first victim is Baldev Sharma
 unhen sanghathan ke mukhpatr paanchajnya ke sampadak pad se rukhsat kar mukhyadhara se jude yuva patrkaar 36 varshiya hitesh shankar ko jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 Manmohan Vaidya, the All India publicity head of the Sangh, and Vijay Kumar, the province's Proceedings of Delhi, are believed to be the facilitators of this change, who is also the general manager of Panchjanya's publisher Bharat Prakashan
 par kya sangh kii nai niti hi sharma kii vidaai kaa sabab bani?ab rajyasabha main virajman tarun vijay ke sampadakatv main pehle bhi paanchajnya main arase tak kaam kar chuke sharma 14 agast, 2008 ko iske sampadak bane the
 While celebrating Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in the issue of May 28 last year, Sharma wrote, "narendra Modi's clean, public service and development administration has made Gujarat as a development model in front of the country and also has a reputation on the international board
 Is administered
 
 
 gujarat to ek prayog bhoomi he, desh kii nayi tasviir gadhia abhi shesh he
 "it is believed that this praise of Modi did not embrace the opponents of Modi in the Sangh and the psyche was not made to pursue Sharma's contract
" sangh ke sabhi prakashnon kii nigaraanee karne vaale manmohan vaidya ke modi se asahaj rishte jagajaahir hai
 And Sharma's attitude towards Modi was evident from his editorials
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi kii jeet ko paanchajnya ne 22 disambar, 2012 ke ank main rashtravaadi raajnneeti kii jeet bataaya or sara shrey modi ko diya
 In the editorial, Modi's speech given after the victory was also highly praised and the Lokayukta case in the January 5 issue was termed as propaganda against Modi
 sutron ke mutabik, may 2012 main is mukhpatr main likhe sharma ke ek aalekh ke baad jab unhen seva vistaar na dene kii halchal hui to unhone bhi sangh main apane prabhaav kaa istemaal kiya
 He received a six-month extension
 yah avadhi isi 13 farvari ko khatm ho rahi thi
 But he already resigned after not seeing the extension
 is maamle main sharma kuch bhi kehane se inkaar karte hai
 But Vijay Kumar says, "time changes
" baldev bhai kaa kaarykaal purna ho gaya
 "they say about the Sangh's new thinking of handing over the command to young professionals," the challenges that all media houses face are the same
 isi sandarbh main board ne badlaav kaa faisla kiya
 However, the decrease in the circulation numbers has also been the reason for the change
 sangh ne nae sampadak hitesh shankar ke saath paanch saal kaa anubandh kiya he
 Till recently he was the deputy news editor in a Hindi daily
 sangh netaaon kii daleel he ki ab sangh aadhunik daur ke saath kadamtal karnaa chahta he or isi ranneeti ke tahat usne apane sabhi prakashnon main peshewar logon kii bhartee karne kaa faisla kiya he
 The English weekly Organizer is also likely to change soon
 sangh ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai, ‘sangh ne apane sabhi prakashnon ko saaf kar diya he ki ve vichaardhaara ke saath chhedchhad kiye bina aadhunik jamaane ke hisaab se use aage badhayen
 How it will happen, it is for the young professionals to decide
 isamen naakaam rahane waalon ko hataane main sangh hichkegaa nahin
 The Sangh has also formed a strong editorial board of Panchajanya by adding some experts
 embibies main daakhile kii taiyaari kar rahe yuvaaon ke liye acchhee khabar he
 In UP, 500 MBBS seats of government quota will be increased from next academic session

 unhone kaha ki iske liye abhi se taiyaariyaan puri kar lee jaaen
 a statement by Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma remains a matter of discussion at this time
 dinesh sharma ne kaha he ki sita ji kaa janm mitti ke bartan se hua tha, jo ki siddh karata he ki us samay bhi test tub se bachche paidaa karne kaa concept tha
 After Dinesh Sharma's ruckus on this statement, the party leadership has now taken action
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke nirdesh par party mahasachiv bhupendra yadav ne dinesh sharma se baat kii
 On behalf of the party, Dinesh Sharma has been advised to make a statement on such issue carefully
 gauratlab he ki is bayaan ke aane ke baad se hi soshal media par dinesh sharma ko trol kiya ja rahaa tha
 Did you say Dinesh Sharma? Actually, while addressing an event of Hindi Journalism Day in Mathura, he said that Sita ji was born from a clay pot, that is, at that time there was also a concept of having children from a test tube
 dinesh sharma ne kaha ki sita ji bhi test tub baby ho sakati hai
 He said, 'during the Ramayana period, Mother Sita was born from an earthen pot, that is, in the time of Ramayana, the test tube baby must have been the technique
 'itnaa hi nahin balki dinesh sharma ne apane bhaashan main mahabharat or ramayana kaal kii takanic kaa bhi jamkar bakhaan kiya
 Dinesh Sharma was speaking on Journalism Day, then he said that Lord Narada was the first journalist
 patrakarita ab se nahin balki kaaphi pehle se jari he
 Let me tell you that this is not the first time that a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party is in discussion with his statement
 isse pehle tripura ke mukhyamantri biplab kumaar dev bhi mahabharat main internet, satellite jaise kai bayaan dekar charchaa kaa vishay ban chuke hai

 On Tuesday, there was a ruckus in Amit Shah's roadshow, till late evening many BJP leaders were detained in Kolkata itself
 kolkata road sho main hue bavaal ke baad bhartiya janata party ke pramukh amit shah ke khilaaf bhi kolkata main shikaayat darj ho gai he
 At the same time, BJP leader Amit Malviya has alleged that many leaders, including Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, are currently in custody
 BJP IT cell ke pramukh amit malviya ne buudhvaar subah twit kar aarope lagaaya he
 He wrote that Mamata Banerjee ordered a night-long detention of BJP leaders, in Kolkata many leaders were picked up at night
 inamen tejinder paal singh bagga ke alaava kai aise netaa hai jo abhi tiemasi kii gaiyrkanoonee hiraasat main hai
 Mamata Banerjee ordered a midnight crack down on several BJP leaders in Kolkata, who were picked up in the middle of the night, without due process of law being followed
 Tajinder Bagga and several others are now in tmc’s illegal detention
 # savebengalsavedemocracy # freetajinderbagga — Chowkidar Amit Malviya (@amitmalviya) May 15, 2019 Let you know that BJP President Amit Shah had a road show in Kolkata on Tuesday
 is road sho main baari bheed to juty lekin ant hote-hote bavaal ho gaya
 Road shows were set on fire, violence erupted and a scuffle among TMC-BJP supporters
 bijepi is mudde par hamalavar he or dilli main bada pradarshan kar sakati he, to vahiin party adhyaksh amit shah bhi press conference tiemasi par hamalaa bol sakate hai
 On the other hand, Mamta Banerjee is also not in a mood to give up in this battle, Mamta has announced to take a padyatra in Kolkata today

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the Election News Special Newsletter vanchit tabake ke liye chalane vaale zyaadaatar saamaajik andolan kuch sweekaaryata hasil karne ke baad chunavi raste par chal padate hai
 Though this change takes place to gain power and justice, but partisan politics eradicates social inclination from their movement
 chandrashekhar aaazaad kii bhim army isi tarah ke chairaahe par khadi he, jahaan use yah tay karnaa he ki ab chunavi chalaang lagaaein yaa saamaajik andolan ke rup main aage chalate rahen
 Azad has strong 'rivals' like Mayawati and BSP
 aaj aaazaad jo kar rahe hai, usee tarah se mayawati ne 1980 ke dashak main manuwaad ke khilaaf apane aag ugalane vaale bhaashanon se savarna hinduon kii jyaadati kaa masalaa uthaaya tha
 But Azad has been critical of Mayawati's politics and he wants to focus on Bahujan again
 haalanki, ve is baat ko jaanate hai ki bharat ke haashiye ke logon main mayawati kaa kya sthaan he or yah bhi jaanate hai ki abhi rajnatik chalaang lagane kaa samay nahin aayaa he
 Therefore, he will have to avoid confrontation with 'bua' Mayawati in public
 rajnatik vishleshak or virdohi mayawati ko to khaarij kar sakate hai, lekin unki basapa ab bhi ek rashtriya pahchaan banaae hue he
 The challenge from within the Ambedkarite Jamaat is not new to her, but she has always overcome the challenge from within and has maintained her party a favorable and effective force in national Ambedkarite politics
 haalanki, is vichaar ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa ki mayawati or nai peedi ke ambedkarwaadi netaaon ke bich ek tarah kii duuri he
 The truth is that Azad's release on September 14, just a day before Mayawati was about to start the 2019 Lok Sabha election campaign in Lucknow with enthusiasm, could be a tactic to confuse her strong supporters and activists
 aaazaad kii rihaai se congress ko pashchimi uttar pradesh main apane dalit-muslim gathjod ke jariye phir se apni jagah banane main madad mil sakati he
 State Congress Vice President Imran Masood has been in constant touch with Azad and Azad also thanked him for his cooperation after his release from jail
 basapa kii rajnatik virdohi—bhaajapa or congress, donon jignesh mewaani or aaazaad jaise nae netaaon main apane liye avasar dekh rahi hai
 Many commentators call Mevani the next Kanshi Ram
 aaazaad ne jahaan ambedkarwaadi raajnneeti main neeche se jagah banaai he, vahiin mewaani is duniya main ek tarah se parachute se utre hue netaa hai
 Mewani started her political innings with criticism of leaders like Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram and Mayawati in the 'politics of identity'
 disambar, 2017 ke gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon main congress ko yah ummid rahi hogi ki jignesh mewaani kaa samarthan kar vah basapa ke thode-bahut prabhaav ko beasar kar degi
 But later he would have felt that there was more benefit than an alliance with the BSP
 hamaari rashtriya raajnneeti ke is mode par jab vipakshi dal bhaajapa ke prabhutv se mukaable ke liye ek thos ranneeti kii talash ke liye jujh rahe hai, mayawati bhi apana aadhaar badhaane ke liye avasar kii talash main hai
 Following the real strategy of her political guru, she wants a forced government (weak government) so that the disadvantaged sections get more bargain
 duusari taraf, bhajaap bhi vanchit jatiyon ko lubhaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 She is trying to introduce a new Hindutva which is an inclusive true religion and in which there is development of sabka saath, sabka (excluding Muslims)
 congress bhi hindutv or rashtrawaad par apana daawa jataa rahi he
 Putting aside the rhetoric, so far bjp's alleged inclusive Hindutva has seen an increase in violence against Dalits in many bjp-ruled states
 daliton ko sahaara dene ke liye laae gaye atyaachaar nivaaran act jaise kanoonon kii jaruraton par bhi sawaal kiye ja rahe hai
 On the other hand, Mayawati is not going to waste her time visiting temple-temple darshan
 ve prabhavi tareeke se basapa kii rashtriya maujuudagi kaa phayda uthaate hue madhya pradesh or rajasthan main congress se jabardast moltol main lagi hai, jahaan vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai
 By calling on Dalits and other disadvantaged sections to vote for themselves, the BSP has been continuously trying to end the practice in which the deprived sections have been voting for the upper castes
 mayawati ne aisi paristhitiyon kaa bhi nirmaan kiya he, jisamen oonchi jatiyon ke log neeche aakar basapa ke liye vot karte hai
 The bsp's national presence — and relevance — is largely dependent on the fact that there is no disintegration of Ambedkarite party politics in North India
 vaise to kai saamaajik andolan hai, lekin basapa ambedkarwaadiyon kii sabase mahatvapurn rajnatik aawaaj bani hui he
 Success in democratic politics requires walking on the path of balance and pragmatism
 aaazaad is baat ko jaanate hai or ab ve khud ko 'ravan' kahlaana pasand nahin karte
 But it is too early for him to negotiate a political confrontation with Mayawati
 unhen kuch samay ke liye saamaajik kshetra main apane ugr bahujanavaad ko hi banaae rakhana hoga

 mahatma gandhi kii antarang sahyatri kii haal hi main mili diary bataati he ki brahmacharya ko lekar kiye gaye unke prayog ne manuben ke jivan ko kaise badal daalaa
 She is a well-known face of Indian history who became a 'sahara' in the last two years, with Mahatma Gandhi like a shadow
 phir bhi yah cheharaa logon ke liye ek paheli he
 In 1946, at the age of just 17, this woman became the personal assistant of the Mahatma and remained with him till his death
 phir bhi manuben ke naam se mashhoor mridula gandhi ne 40 varsh kii umr main avivaahit rahete hue dilli main gumnami main dam todaa
 In the 1982 Richard Attenborough film Gandhi, the character Manuben was played by Supriya Pathak
 manuben ke nidhan ke chaar dashak ke baad unki das diariyaan india today ko dekhne ko milin
 Written in Gujarati and spread over 2,000 pages, these diaries begin on April 11, 1943
 gujarati vidwaan rigwan kadri ne in diariyon kaa vistaar se adhyayan kiya
 These shows how Gandhi's experiments with his sexuality had an impact on Manuben's mind
 inase gandhi ke sampark main rahane vaale logon ke man main panapati irshyaa or krodh kii bhaavana bhi ujagar hoti he
 Most of them were young women
 diariyon kaa lekhan us samay shuru hua jab gandhi ke bhai kii potee manuben pune main aagaa khan pales main najarband gandhi kii patni kasturba kii seva karne ai thim
 Gandhi and Kasturba were placed under house arrest in 1942 during the Quit India Movement
 beemaari ke antim dinon main manuben ne kasturba kii seva kii
 On 30 January 1948, Nathuram Godse pushed Manuben aside and fired three bullets at Gandhi with his 9 mm Barreta pistol
 uske 22 din baad manuben ne diary likhnaa band kar diya
 Gandhi has his signature on the margins in the diaries
 inase unke prati samarpit ek ladki kii chhavi ubhartee he
 In the entry recorded in Shrirampur, Bihar on 28 December 1946, Manuben wrote, "bapu is my mother
 ve brahmacharya ke prayogon ke madhyam se mujhe oonche maanviya falak par le ja rahe hai
 These experiments are part of his Mahayagya for character building
 inke bare main koi bhi ulti-sidhi baat sabase nindaneey he
 Nine days before this, Manuben had come with Gandhi
 us samay 77 varshiya gandhi tatkaaleen purvi bengal main noakhli main hui hatyaon ke baad ashaant gaanvon main gum rahe the
 Confirming this, Gandhi's secretary Pyarelal wrote in his book Mahatma Gandhi: The Last Phase, "he did everything that a mother would do for her daughter
" uski padhai, uske bhojan, poshaak, aaraam or neend har baat kaa ve khyaal rakhte the
 Gandhi used to put him to bed on his own bed for close care and guidance
 man se maasoom kisi ladki ko apni maa ke saath sone main kabhi shame nahin aati
 Manuben was Gandhi's chief personal servant
 ve maalish or nahalaane se lekar unka khaanaa pakaane tak saare kaam karti thim
 Among these diaries, Dr
 sushila nayyar jaisi mahatma gandhi kii mahila sahyogiyon ke jivan kaa bhi vistaar se varnan he
 Pyarelal's sister was Sushila Gandhi's personal physician, who later became Union Health Minister
 unke alaava punjabi muslim mahila bibi amtussalaam bhi in mahilaon main shaamil thim
 There is also a glimpse of tremendous jealousy among the women who were involved in the experiments of the Mahatma of Brahmacharya
 manuben ne 24 farvari, 1947 ko bihar ke hemachar main apni diary main darj kiya, ‘‘aaj baapu ne amtussalaam ben ko ek kadaa patr likhakar kaha ki unka jo patr mila he usase jaahir hota he ki brahmacharya ke prayog unke saath shuru na hone se ve kuch naaraaz hai
 "in 2010, these diaries found in the National Archives in Delhi have also written that at the age of 47, Pyarelal was eager to marry Manuben and Sushila was pushing for it
" 2 farvari, 1947 ko bihar ke dashadhriya main aakhirkaar manuben ko likhnaa hi padaa, ‘‘main pyarelalji ko apane bade bhai kii tarah maanati hum, iske alaava kuch bhi nahin
 The day i decide to marry my guru, my elder brother or my grandfather, i will marry him on that day
 is bare main mujh par or dabaav mat daalana
 "manuben's observations also reflect the growing dissatisfaction among Gandhi's followers regarding celibacy experiments
" 31 janvari, 1947 ko bihar ke navgram main darj pravishti main manuben ne ghanishtha anuyaayi kishorlal mashruwala ke gandhi ko likhe patr kaa ullekh kiya he, jisamen unhone manu ko ‘‘maaya’’ bataate hue mahatma se uske changul se mukt hone kaa aagrah kiya tha
 Gandhi's answer to this was: "whatever you do, but my faith in this experiment is unwavering
" ’’ manuben or gandhi jab bengal main noakhli kii yatra kar rahe the tab unke do sachiv aar
 P
 parashuram or nirmal kumaar bose gandhi ke aacharan se naaraaz hokar unka saath chhod gaye the
 This same Nirmal Kumar Bose later became the director of the Anthropological Society of India
 sardaar vallabhbhai patel ne 25 janvari, 1947 ko likhe ek patr main gandhi se kaha tha ki ve yah prayog roak den
 Patel described it as a 'terrible mistake' of Gandhi causing his followers 'deep pain'
 yah patr rashtriya abhilekhaagaar main sardaar patel ke dastavejon main shaamil he
 The tremendous impression that Mahatma had left on Manuben's mind comes from the letter of Morarji Desai written in the name of Jawaharlal Nehru on August 19, 1955
 manuben ek ‘‘agyaat rog’’ ke ilaaj ke liye bombai hospital main bhartee thim
 After meeting him there in August, Morarji Desai wrote: "manu has more problems than body
 lagata he, ve jivan se haar gai hai or sabhi prakaar kii dawaaon se unhen allergy ho gai he
 On January 30, 1948, at 5:17 pm in Delhi's Birla House when Nathuram Godse shot the Mahatma, apart from Manuben, Abhaben Gandhi was also next to Mahatma
 abha unke bhattije kanu gandhi kii patni thim
 The next day Manuben wrote, "when the flames of the pyre were swallowing Bapu's body, i wanted to sit there for a long time after the funeral
 sardaar patel ne mujhe dhants bandhaaya or apane ghar le gaye
 It was all unimaginable for me
 do din pehle tak baapu hamaare saath the
 Till yesterday, at least he had a body and today i am completely alone
 mujhe kuch sujh nahin rahaa he
 "then the next and final entry in the diary is dated February 21, 1948, when Manuben boarded a train from Delhi and left for Mahuva near Bhavnagar
 isamen unhone likhaa, ‘‘aaj maine dilli chhod di
 Manuben wrote five books after Gandhi's death
 inamen se ek last glimpsij of baapu main unhone likhaa, ‘‘kaaka (gandhi ke sabase chote bete devdas) ne mujhe chetaya ki apni diary main likhi gai baaten kisi ko na bataaun or mahatvapurn patron main likhi gai baton kii jaankaree bhi na duun
 He said, you are very young but you have very valuable literature and you are not yet mature
 ’’baapu: maay madar naam se apane 68 pannon ke sansmaran main bhi manuben ne gandhi ke saath unki sexuality ke prayogon main shaamil rahane ke baavjood unke bare main apni bhaawanaaon kaa kahin ullekh nahin kiya
 In one of the 15 chapters of the book, Manuben writes that Kasturba died within 10 months of his going to Pune
 uske baad baapu ne maun vrath dhaaran kar liya or ve sirf likhakar hi apni baat kehete the
 a few days later he received a very touching note from Bapu, in which he advised him to go to Rajkot and resume his studies
 is adhyay main manuben ne likhaa, ‘‘us din se baapu meri mata ban gaye
 Kishori Manuben had studied up to the fifth standard in Karachi where his father, Gandhi's nephew Jayasukhlal Scindia, worked at the Steam Navigation Company
 pune aane se kuch din pehle hi manu ne apni maa ko khoyaa tha isliye unhen bhi maa rupi sahare kii jarurat thi
 Manuben spent the last years of his life completely alone
 gandhi kii hatya ke baad kareeb 21 varsh tak ve gujarat main bhavnagar ke nikat mahuwa main raheen
 She ran a children's school and she also founded Bhagini Samaj to protect the interests of women
 jivan ke antim charan main manuben kii ek sahyogi bhanuben lahidi bhi swatantraaa senaniyon ke parivaar kii thim
 Lahiri, one of the 22 female members of the society, remembers how deeply Gandhi had impacted Manu's life
 unka kahana he ki ek baar jab manuben ne apane ek garib anuyaayi ke vivaah ke liye unase chunari lee to bol padin, ‘‘main to khud ko mira bai maanati hum jo sirf apane ‘yamlo (krishna) ke liye jiti rahi
 "during these experiments, Mahatma Gandhi became so focused on his feelings that i think he ignored his influence on the women involved in these experiments," says psychologist and scholar Sudhir Kakkar about these diaries
 Must have decided
 vibhinn mahilaon ke bich jalan kii lapten uthne ke alaava hamen nahin maaloom ki in prayogon ne unamem se har mahila ke man par koi prabhaav daalaa tha yaa nahin
 "now, after getting Manuben's diaries, we can at least guess what kind of impression the Mahatma had left on the minds of these allies or what effect these experiments had on him
" madhuben kii diariyaan kaise jagajaahir huin1
 Until 1969 Manuben died in his diaries in Mahuva
 unhone apane pita jaisukhlal se kaha tha ki diariyaan unki bahan sanyuktaben kii beti minaa jain ko saunp di jaaen

 The dramatic figure recorded in the diary of big-time player Manuben (1899–1982) was Gandhi's personal secretary in later years

 There is one such member of 'bigg Boss' house who initially got so much praise that she raises her voice against the wrong happening in the house
 apane doston ke liye stand leti hai
 She is considered to be the strongest contestant on the show but for the last few weeks we are seeing that she loses her temper during the task, doing childish acts
 haar bardaasht nahin kar paatin or apni galati swikaarne kii bajaae nakhre dikhaane lagati hai
 His negative attitude towards Bani j is also not hidden from anyone
 aise main jab sho phinale ke itane kareeb pahunch chukaa he to ham aapkaa dhyaan is maheene hui kuch aisi ghatnaon kii taraf le janaa chahenge jinamein lopa kii harkaton kii vajah se unki bani banaai chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaa or gharavaale bhi unase dur hote najar aae
 Let us first talk about the events when Lopa won the hearts of the people
 jab swami om ne bani kii maa ke bare main galat baat kahi tab bani se apni takaraar bhuulakar lopa ne bani kaa saath diya or swami om ke khilaaf khadi ho gayi
 After this, Lopa and Priyanka had a fierce fight in the house, Priyanka Jagga abused Lopa and said very badly but the next day when Priyanka's children came to meet her, forgetting their quarrel and met the children in love
 lopamudra big bos 10 kii strong pratibhaagi hai
 Initially, whenever Swami Om made a comment against the female members of the house, Lopa opposed him every time
 captency task ke dauraan jab manavir or gaurav aamane saamne the tab vah manavir ko saport kar rahi thim or jab manavir phisalkar gire lekin unhen dekhne kii bajaae gaurav ne task jari rakhaa to iske liye lopa ne gaurav ko ghar kaa khalanaayak chunaa jabaki baaki gharavaalon ne om swami ko chunaa tha
 Many such occasions came when Lopa won the hearts of family and country with her words and deeds
 lekin pichley kuch hafton se vah lagaataar kuch na kuch aisa kar rahi hai jisase gharavaale unki tulana priyanka jagga or swami om se karne lage hai
 Lopa and Rohan during the BB Dhaba task
 haal hi main hue bibi dhaba task se jisamen lopa ne bani je par aarope lagaaya ki unhone sari jaruri saamagree rakh lee or unhen kuch nahin mila
 She kept blaming 'bigg Boss' that she kept only one packet / bottle of sugar and sauce
 rohan ne unhen samajhane kii koshish kii ki yahi task he par vah nakhre dikhaane lageen ki unhen task nahin karnaa he
 Later, when Manveer jokingly calls Lopa's sweet dish, she is also angry with him for how he can say that
 baad main manu, manavir or bani is baat ko lekar charchaa bhi karte dikhe ki lopa kaa bartaav swami om or priyanka jagga se alag nahin he
 Rohan Mehra is a very good friend of Lopa inside the house
 dhaba task se pehle 'big bos' ne gharavaalon ko sho kii prise mani badhaakar 50 lakh karne kaa ek mauka diya tha jisamen aakhri bajer par rohan or lopa ek saath nikal gaye
 After this, when 'bigg Boss' reduced the prize money to 40 lakhs and said that getting out together was Rohan and Lopa's planning and before the buzzer, Lopa also said that what will happen at most is to cancel the task
 Will go
 is par bhi apni galati chhipaane ke liye lopa 'big bos' kii aad lene lageen ki unhone puri baat nahin suni
 She also started accusing the 'bigg Boss' that she did not have to increase the money and all she needed was an excuse to reduce the prize money
 is par manu ne kaha tha ki lopa ko kam se kam 'big bos' ke khilaaf kuch bhi nahin bolnaa chahie
 Lopa has won most of the tasks but whenever she lost she began to tease tantrums
 isse thik pehle banji task hua jisamen task shuru hote hi lopa ne apana aapa kho diya or vah bani se ulajhane lageen
 Manu lost his balance due to the shock caused by Lopa and he got out of the task
 vahiin lopa task se out hone ke baad bhi hatane ko taiyaar nahin huin
 The next day, after the task was completed, manu-manveer said that Lopa's performance was the weakest and that she had lost her temper at the start of the task, she was not ready to accept and started accusing manu-manveer that they both Are targeting is task ke bare main salmaan khan ne lopa se kaha bhi ki kol centre task main jaisaa bani kaa ravaiya unki taraf tha, is task main unka ravaiya bani kii taraf vaisaa hi tha

 banji task se pehle nomination ke liye hue postman task main lopamudra ke ghar se aayaa parcel bani ke paas tha
 For which Bani told manu-manveer that if Lopa tells her well, she can give him his parcel
 lekin lopa ne shuru se hi maan liya ki bani unhen unka parcel nahin dengi or vah sabase yahi kahati raheen
 After this, Bani decided that she would protect herself by burning a parcel of Lopa
 is task ke dauraan bhi lopa shuru se kahati raheen ki unhen pataa he ki unhen kya karnaa he lekin vah ant main jaaengi
 However, Salman Khan said that Lopa had only decided that Bani and Manu would do the same
 salmaan ne lopa se kaha ki yadi mona ke baad vah jaatin or mona kaa parcel unhen de deteen to shaayad manu or bani bhi parcel jalaane kii bajaae deliver kar dete
 Lopamudra during call center task
 isse pehle hue kol centre task ke dauraan haalanki lopa ne behad shanti se bani ko handle kiya lekin task ke baad jab bani agressive huin to lopa bhi agressive ho gayi or 'big bos' se kehane lageen ki bani ko ghar se baahar nikaala janaa chahie
 On this too, Salman Khan told her that if she kept calm and did not show aggression then action would have been taken against Bani but she too became physical with Bani due to which 'bigg Boss' did not take any action

 The comments aakhir main ham baat karenge is maheene kii shuruyaat main hue ranking task or orbit task ke bare main
 Manu, Manveer, Bani and Lopa were considering themselves as number one contenders in the ranking task
 lekin lopa is baat par ad gayi ki vah number ek par rahanaa diserv karti hai jabaki bani aakhri pojishan
 After this, Lopa benefited from the Orbit task that she joined this task from the second round
 lekin task main shaamil hote hi vah bani par aarope lagane lageen ki vah sabko ishaara kar rahi thim ki unhen dhakka dekar gira den
 During the task, Lopa's shoe laces opened in which she fell, and she began to blame the family that she did not let them tie the laces, so she fell
 lopa 'big bos 10' kii ek strong pratibhaagi hai lekin apni haar swikar na kar paane kii unki khami or apni galatiyon par pardaa daalane ke liye dusron par dosha madhne kii unki aadat kii vajah se unki chhavi ko nuksaan he
 Just a few steps away from the Taj, Lopa needs to improve his behavior so that his fans will not be disappointed and vote for him more and more
 vah final teen main apni jagah bana chuki hai lekin ab yah dekhnaa rochak hoga ki 'big bos 10' kaa tital vah apane naam kar paati hai yaa nahin
 Let us first talk about the events when Lopa won the hearts of the people
 jab swami om ne bani kii maa ke bare main galat baat kahi tab bani se apni takaraar bhuulakar lopa ne bani kaa saath diya or swami om ke khilaaf khadi ho gayi
 After this, Lopa and Priyanka had a fierce fight in the house, Priyanka Jagga abused Lopa and said very badly but the next day when Priyanka's children came to meet her, forgetting their quarrel and met the children in love
 lopamudra big bos 10 kii strong pratibhaagi hai
 Initially, whenever Swami Om made a comment against the female members of the house, Lopa opposed him every time
 captency task ke dauraan jab manavir or gaurav aamane saamne the tab vah manavir ko saport kar rahi thim or jab manavir phisalkar gire lekin unhen dekhne kii bajaae gaurav ne task jari rakhaa to iske liye lopa ne gaurav ko ghar kaa khalanaayak chunaa jabaki baaki gharavaalon ne om swami ko chunaa tha
 Many such occasions came when Lopa won the hearts of family and country with her words and deeds
 lekin pichley kuch hafton se vah lagaataar kuch na kuch aisa kar rahi hai jisase gharavaale unki tulana priyanka jagga or swami om se karne lage hai
 Lopa and Rohan during the BB Dhaba task
 haal hi main hue bibi dhaba task se jisamen lopa ne bani je par aarope lagaaya ki unhone sari jaruri saamagree rakh lee or unhen kuch nahin mila
 She kept blaming 'bigg Boss' that she kept only one packet / bottle of sugar and sauce
 rohan ne unhen samajhane kii koshish kii ki yahi task he par vah nakhre dikhaane lageen ki unhen task nahin karnaa he
 Later, when Manveer jokingly calls Lopa's sweet dish, she is also angry with him for how he can say that
 baad main manu, manavir or bani is baat ko lekar charchaa bhi karte dikhe ki lopa kaa bartaav swami om or priyanka jagga se alag nahin he
 Rohan Mehra is a very good friend of Lopa inside the house
 dhaba task se pehle 'big bos' ne gharavaalon ko sho kii prise mani badhaakar 50 lakh karne kaa ek mauka diya tha jisamen aakhri bajer par rohan or lopa ek saath nikal gaye
 After this, when 'bigg Boss' reduced the prize money to 40 lakhs and said that getting out together was Rohan and Lopa's planning and before the buzzer, Lopa also said that what will happen at most is to cancel the task
 Will go
 is par bhi apni galati chhipaane ke liye lopa 'big bos' kii aad lene lageen ki unhone puri baat nahin suni
 She also started accusing the 'bigg Boss' that she did not have to increase the money and all she needed was an excuse to reduce the prize money
 is par manu ne kaha tha ki lopa ko kam se kam 'big bos' ke khilaaf kuch bhi nahin bolnaa chahie
 Lopa has won most of the tasks but whenever she lost she began to tease tantrums
 isse thik pehle banji task hua jisamen task shuru hote hi lopa ne apana aapa kho diya or vah bani se ulajhane lageen
 Manu lost his balance due to the shock caused by Lopa and he got out of the task

 Before the Dhaba task, 'bigg Boss' gave the family a chance to raise the prize money of the show to 50 lakhs, in which Rohan and Lopa left together at the last buzzer
 iske baad jab 'big bos' ne sajaa ke taur par prise mani ghataakar 40 lakh kii or kaha ki ek saath baahar nikalnaa rohan or lopa kii planning thi or bajer se pehle lopa ne yah bhi kaha tha ki zyada se zyada kya hoga task radd ho jayega
 Still, to hide his mistake, Lopa took the cover of 'bigg Boss' that he did not listen to the whole thing
 vah 'big bos' par aarope bhi lagane lageen ki unhen paise badhaane hi nahin the or unhen sirf bahaanaa chahie tha prise mani ghataane kaa
 On this, Manu said that Lopa should not speak anything against 'bigg Boss' at least
 lopa ne zyaadaatar task jite hai lekin jab bhi unki haar hui vah chidhkar nakhre dikhaane lageen
 Just before this, Bungee task took place in which Lopa lost her temper as soon as the task started and she started getting confused with Bani
 lopa kii vajah se mili jatke kii vajah se manu ne apana balance kho diya or vah task se baahar ho gaye
 At the same time, Lopa was not ready to withdraw even after being dismissed from the task
 agle din jab task puraa hone ke baad manu-manavir ne kaha ki lopa kii parformens sabase kamjor rahi or unhone task shuru hote hi apana aapa kho diya tha to vah maanane ko taiyaar nahin huin or manu-manavir par aarope lagane lageen ki ve donon unhen torget kar rahe hai
 Regarding this task, Salman Khan also told Lopa that Bani's attitude towards him in the call center task was the same as his attitude towards Bani
 big bos ke ghar main lopa, rohan, manu or monalisa
 The parcel that came from Lopamudra's house in the postman task before the bungee task was with Bani
 jiske liye bani ne manu-manavir se kaha ki lopa unase achche se kahengi to vah unhen unka parcel de sakati hai
 But Lopa assumed from the beginning that Bani would not give them their parcel and she kept saying the same
 iske baad bani ne tay kiya ki vah lopa kaa parcel jalaakar khud ko surakshit karengi
 During this task, Lopa kept saying from the beginning that she knew what to do but she would go in the end
 haalanki salmaan khan ne kaha ki lopa ne keval yah tay kiya tha ki jaisaa bani or manu karenge vah bhi vaisaa hi karengi
 Salman told Lopa that if she had gone after Mona and given Mona's parcel, Manu and Bani might have delivered the parcel instead of burning it
 kol centre task ke dauraan lopamudra
 Although Lopa handled Bani very calmly during the earlier call center task, but when Bani became aggressive after the task, Lopa also became aggressive and told 'bigg Boss' that Bani should be taken out of the house
 is par bhi salmaan khan ne unase kaha ki yadi vah shant rahati or agreshan nahin dikhaatin to bani ke khilaaf jarur ection liya jaataa lekin vah bhi bani ke saath physical ho gayi is vajah se 'big bos' ne koi ection nahin liya

 She has made her place in the final three but now it will be interesting to see if she can make the title of 'bigg Boss 10'
 isse pehle hue kol centre task ke dauraan haalanki lopa ne behad shanti se bani ko handle kiya lekin task ke baad jab bani agressive huin to lopa bhi agressive ho gayi or 'big bos' se kehane lageen ki bani ko ghar se baahar nikaala janaa chahie
 On this too, Salman Khan told her that if she kept calm and did not show aggression then action would have been taken against Bani but she too became physical with Bani due to which 'bigg Boss' did not take any action
 mining task ke dauraan apane dost rohan kii khatir lopa apana sikret task haar gai thim
 The comments aakhir main ham baat karenge is maheene kii shuruyaat main hue ranking task or orbit task ke bare main
 Manu, Manveer, Bani and Lopa were considering themselves as number one contenders in the ranking task
 lekin lopa is baat par ad gayi ki vah number ek par rahanaa diserv karti hai jabaki bani aakhri pojishan
 After this, Lopa benefited from the Orbit task that she joined this task from the second round
 lekin task main shaamil hote hi vah bani par aarope lagane lageen ki vah sabko ishaara kar rahi thim ki unhen dhakka dekar gira den
 During the task, Lopa's shoe laces opened in which she fell, and she began to blame the family that she did not let them tie the laces, so she fell
 lopa 'big bos 10' kii ek strong pratibhaagi hai lekin apni haar swikar na kar paane kii unki khami or apni galatiyon par pardaa daalane ke liye dusron par dosha madhne kii unki aadat kii vajah se unki chhavi ko nuksaan he
 Just a few steps away from the Taj, Lopa needs to improve his behavior so that his fans will not be disappointed and vote for him more and more
 vah final teen main apni jagah bana chuki hai lekin ab yah dekhnaa rochak hoga ki 'big bos 10' kaa tital vah apane naam kar paati hai yaa nahin
 Finally, we will talk about the ranking task and orbit task earlier this month
 ranking task main manu, manavir,bani or lopa khud ko number ek kaa daavedaar maan rahe the
 But Lopa insisted that she deserves to be at number one while Bani's last position
 iske baad hue orbit task main lopa ko phayda mila ki vah duusare round se is task main shaamil huin
 But as soon as she joined the task, she started accusing Bani that she was pointing to everyone to push and drop them
 task ke dauraan lopa ke juute kaa les khul gaya jisamen funskar vah gir gayi or iskaa dosha gharavaalon ko dene lageen ki unhone unhen les baandhne nahin diya is vajah se vah gir gayi
 Lopa is a strong contender of 'bigg Boss 10' but her flaws for not being able to accept her defeat and her habit of blaming others for exposing her mistakes have damaged her image
 taj se bas kuch hi kadam dur lopa ke liye jaruri he ki vah apane vyavhaar main sudhaar karen taaki unke phans niraash na hon or unhen zyada se zyada vot karen
 She has made her place in the final three but now it will be interesting to see if she can make the title of 'bigg Boss 10'
 lopa 'big bos 10' kii ek strong pratibhaagi hai lekin apni haar swikar na kar paane kii unki khami or apni galatiyon par pardaa daalane ke liye dusron par dosha madhne kii unki aadat kii vajah se unki chhavi ko nuksaan he
 Just a few steps away from the Taj, Lopa needs to improve his behavior so that his fans will not be disappointed and vote for him more and more
 vah final teen main apni jagah bana chuki hai lekin ab yah dekhnaa rochak hoga ki 'big bos 10' kaa tital vah apane naam kar paati hai yaa nahin
 Munaf Patel, who was a member of the 2011 World Champion Team India, feels that in the World Cup starting next month in Australia and New Zealand, India will miss a bowler like Zaheer Khan and the inexplicable attack could shatter the team's title hopes
 '2011 jaisi santulit team nahin he'do baar world cap team ke sadsy rahe patel ne kaha ki bharat ke maujuuda tej gendbaaj acchhee saajhedaari nahin nibhaa paa rahe hai or isse team ko sabase adhik nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Munaf said, 'it is clear that the team is not as balanced as last time
 srisanth or maine jahir khan ko puraa saath diya tha
 He (zaheer) is a bowler who has played close to 100 Test matches and it makes a lot of difference when he talks to you in between overs or under pressure situations
 'unhone iske saath hi kaha, 'harbhajan bhi team main tha
 So all the bowlers were experienced and it made a big difference
 is baar aisa kuch nahin he lekin mujhe phir bhi ummid he ki team acha pradarshan karke khitaab barkaraar rakhegi
 Overall, there are not many experienced players in the team
 'bhuvi-eshanth par rahegaa daaromadarpatel ne kaha ki bhubaneshwar kumaar or eshanth sharma par bhartiya gendbaaji kaa daaromadar rahegaa lekin unhen lay main gendbaaji kerani hogi kyonki australia ke khilaaf haal main khatm hui test siries main isaki kami ke kaaran bharat ko nuksaan hua
 He said, 'no partnership was seen in our bowlers in the Test series and it caused us the most losses
 jis tarah se ballebaaji main bhagidaari ahm he usee tarah se gendbaaji main bhi vah ahm hoti he
 Pressure is created from one side and is removed from the other side
 'vanade main test jitani buree haalat nahipatel ne kaha, 'yahaan aapako jahir jaise gendbaaj kii jarurat padati he jo over ke bich main aapse baat karegaa
 The situation in odis is not as bad as the Test, so it is expected that the players will perform well
 ' unhone yuva gendbaajon ko teji ke saath gendbaaji main control rakhane kii salaah di
 Patel said, "there is nothing better than keeping pace and control
 main maujuuda gendbaajon ko bhi yahi salaah duungaa
 If you tell me, fast agreement should not be made at any cost
 agar aap teji par length ko chunate ho to yah galat he
 Input language canadai pradhanmantri justin trudo kii bharat kii yatra ko puraa hue 4 maheene se zyada kaa vakt guzar chukaa he, lekin is yatra se judi kuch na kuch khabaren abhi bhi saamne aa rahi hai
 It is now reported that Trudeau had gifted more than 11 lakh rupees to a chef during this tour
 is saal farvari menjustin trudoke 7 divasiy bharat daure ko lekar bharat sarkaar kii ore se koi utsukata nahin dikhaai gai thi, baavjood iske yah yatra aaj bhi charchaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 Apart from India, the tour was also critically criticized in Canada
 mahangi bakhshish kaa maamla tab saamne aayaa jab canada kii conservative party ne twit kar yah bataaya ki trudo ne bharat daure ke dauraan nai dilli main hui ek baithak ke liye khaanaa banane vaale shef vikram vij ko 11 lakh 65 hajaar rupye (17 hajaar 44 dollar) bakhshish ke taur par de daale
 Opposition parties are surrounding Trudeau over the matter
 vainkavur ke shef vikram vij nai dilli main ek baithak ke liye khaanaa banane aae the or unhen canadai pradhanmantri kii ore se shandaar bakhshish de di gai
 The opposition party attacked the Conservative Party, tweeting from its official Twitter handle, calling Prime Minister Trudeau's visit as his 'personal' visit
 haalanki baad main is twit ko delit kar diya gaya
 Trudeau came to India in February this year and his one week long tour was severely criticized in his country Canada
 sthaneey media ke mutabik conservative party ne aarope lagaaya tha ki trudo ne is daure par 15 lakh dollar yani 10 karod rupye se bhi zyada kharch kiye
 He also alleged that Trudeau's visit deteriorated bilateral relations with India
 haalanki pichley maheene ke ant main trudo ne ek kaarykram membharat daure kaa zikrakiya or uskaa majaak udaate hue kaha ki ab us daure kii yaad nahin
 He had said, 'I did not go on a trip to India, no memory of that
 ' justin trudo ne tab press gailaree dinar ke dauraan 'bharat daura 2018' par slide sho dikhaate hue kareeb 15 minute bhaashan diya
 During his arrival on stage, 'jai Ho' song was playing, and he also greeted everyone by saying 'namaste'

 The company has shifted 4G customers to 3G networks
 company kaa iraadaa dhire-dhire deshbhar main 3ji network ko band karne kaa he
 This step has been taken under this
 airtel ne bayaan main kaha, ‘haryana main graahakon ko ab airtel mobile broadband sevaayen drut gati ke 4ji networkapar echdi gunvattta vaali volt colling ke saath uplabdh hogi

 'company ne kaha ki airtel 3ji ke graahakon ko isaki soochna di gai he or unase apane handset or sim ko 4ji ke liye adhyatan karaane ko kaha gaya he
 However, in view of the connectivity needs of the consumers of feature phones, Airtel has decided to continue 2G services in Haryana

 Thanks to you all
 itani dur se bulaayaa wo bhi sunne ke liye jab koi kisi kii nahin sun rahaa he
 The credibility of the interview has fallen so much that now only speech and standup comedy are supported
 sawaalon ke jawaab nahin hai balki netaa ji ke aashirvachan rah gaye hai
 There are two types of governments in India
 ek government of india
 Second Government of Media
 main yahaan government of media tak hi simit rahoonga taaki kisi ko bura na lage ki maine videsh main garvanment of india ke bare main kuch kah diya
 It depends on you how much difference you can make between listening to me and the media
 ek ko janata ne chunaa he or duusare ne khud ko sarkaar ke liye chun liya he
 One is elected by vote and one is rated
 yahaan america main media he, bharat main godi media he
 i do not want to prolong my speech by giving one example, nor do i intend to embarrass you
 garvanment of media main bahut kuch acha he
 Like weather news
 accident kii khabaren
 Saina and Sindhu win, Dangal being a super hit
 aisa nahin he ki kuch bhi acha nahin he
 Millions of young men are standing in line for 14 posts of peons, who says there is hope
 collejon main chah chah saal main bie karne vaale lakhon noujvaan intazaar kar rahe hai, koun kahata he ki ummid nahin bachi he
 There is only hope that these young men are left behind
 ek daraa hua patrkaar loktantr main mara hua naagarik paidaa karata he
 a scared journalist becomes your hero, that means you have given fear to your home
 is vakt bharat ke loktantr ko bharat ke media se khatara he
 India's TV media has turned against democracy
 bharat kaa print media chupchaap us qatl main shaamil he jisamen bahata hua koon to nahin dikhataa he, magar idhar-udhar kone main chhaapi ja rahi kuch kaam kii khabaron main qatl kii aah sunai de jaati he
 The death of CBI court judge BH Loya is proof of who the Indian media is with
 kairavaan patrika kii report aane ke baad dilli ke ankar aasmaan kii taraf dekhne lage or hawaaon main nami kii maatra vaali khabaren padhane lage the
 Even opposition parties have become victims of this fear
 unke netaaon ko badi der baad himmat ai ki jaj loya kii maut ke sawaalon kii jaanch kii maang kii jaae
 When the courage came, the bench of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was hearing the case of Judge Loya
 iske baad bhi congress party ne jab jaj loya se sambandhit purv jajon kii maut par sawaal uthaaya to use dilli ke akhbaaron ne nahin chapa, channelon ne nahin dikhaaya
 It is not that the Government of Media forgot to ask questions
 usne rahul gandhi ke star vars dekhne par kitna bada sawaal kiya tha
 You can say that the Government of India wants Sirius to be the Leader of the Opposition
 lekin jab vah netaa sirius hokar jaj loya ko lekar press conference kar detaa he to media apana siriyasnes bhul jaataa he
 Remember friends, i am talking about the Government of Media, not the Government of India abroad
 media main kya koi khud se dar gaya he yaa kisi ke daraane se dar gaya he, yah ek khulaa prashn he
 Fear has nothing to do with DNA, anyone can be afraid, especially in a fake case and hanging lawsuits for many years where it is easy, fear is part of the system
 dar natural he
 Gandhi went to jail and freed us from the fear of jail
 ghulaam bharat ke garib se garib or anpadh se anpadh log jail ke dar se azaad ho gaye
 There was a scam of 2 lakh crores in 2G, but when the accused are acquitted, they have not been able to speak till date
 jinaki kitaab kaa naam he NOT JUST AN ACCOUNTANT, THE DIARY OF NATIONS CONSCIENCE KEEPER
 When the 2G accused were acquitted, the CBI was unable to produce evidence when i first saw it, while hiding the cover of a book
 aapane dekha he aisa hote hue
 It seems that the book is saying that it turned out to be true that they are not just accountants, but it is a lie that they are the conscience keeper of the nations
 ek daraa hua media jab super power india kaa hedline lagaataa he tab mujhe us power se dar lagata he
 i want Guru to reach at least those colleges where 8500 girls study but 9 teachers to teach before becoming a world teacher
 phir aap kahenge ki kya kuch bhi acha nahin ho rahaa he
 Is it not good that our girls are passing BA even without teachers? kya aap aisa harvard main karke dikhaa sakate hai? cambridge main dikhaa sakate hai, oxford main dikhaa sakate hai, kya aap yel or colombia main aisa karke dikhaa sakate hai? Media has left the basic question of India
 isliye maine kaha ki itani dur se aakar main garvanment of media kii baat karuunga taaki aapako na lage ki main garvanment of india kii baat kar rahaa hum
 i am criticizing the media, not India
 aap i or m main kanfus mat kar janaa
 There are two channels of the same owner
 ek hi channel main do ankar hai
 One is spreading communalism, one is talking of farmers
 ek jhooth failaa rahaa he, ek tuuti sadakon kii baat kar rahaa he
 The question is from the questioner like us, like we do not have the answer
 aap unase puuchhie jo aap tak media ko lekar aate hai, jo aap tak india lekar aate hai
 Fake News is official news today
 news room main reporter samaapt ho chuke hai
 The reporter is used as a murderer
 ek channel main ek saansad ke pich chaar paanch reporter ek saath bhej diya
 It was seen that all the media was behind him
 yah nayaa daur he
 Scared media has come to scare you with its cameras
 channelon par sampradayikta bhadakaane vaale ankaron ko jagah mil rahi he
 These anchors have no question for the government, only one question is with everyone
 is sawaal kaa naam he hindu muslim queshchan, HMQ
 India's news anchors have become communal under the guise of nationalism
 is had tak ki jab udaipur main noujvaan bhagava jhanda lekar adaalat kii chat par chadh jate hai to ankar chup ho gaye hai
 Did we want such an India, want it? The constitution under which the court is under the same constitution, the media assumes the phase of its independence
 charnamrita to samajhate honge
 The Government of Media has the same agenda
 hindu muslim queshchan
 There is so much of fake news related to it that you can read on Alt News
com
 ab to phek news duusari taraf se banane lage hai
 My dear friends, believe me, media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 It is creating such an imbalance in the society, through its debates, is poisoning such a poison that creates an atmosphere of fear within our democracy
 jisase ek bheed kabhi bhi kahin bhi trigar ho jaati he or aapako overpavar kar detii he
 You would say what is so bad, nothing is good
 mujhe pataa he ki aapako bich bich main positive acha lagata he
 i will tell you a positive bharat kaa loktantr media ke jhuk jane se nahin jhuk jaataa he
 It will not disappear as media is lost
 vah na to apatkaal main jhukaa na vah godi media ke kaal main jhukegaa
 The democracy of India is our soul
 hamaara zamir he
 The soul is immortal
 aap gita pard sakate hai
 i am talking about the Government of Media
 aapaki tarah main bhi bharat ko lekar sapane dekhtaa hum
 But while awake saamne kii hakeekat hi mere liye sapana he
 i dream of an India that can face reality
 sochie zaraa ham aaj kal ateet ke sawaalon me kyon uljhe hai
 If we have to face these questions, then are we doing properly, is there a TV studio instead of facing these questions? Or is it a classroom, a conference room, and how will we face it, will we calculate today, will we commit murder today? So are you ready to deliver a killer from your home? This storm of hate will create a killer in every house, it can be your brother, can be a son, can be a friend, can be a neighbor, have you made up your mind? Have we learned how to face history? We are out in the class room, not in the street and TV studios to calculate history
 nehru ko musalmaan bana dene se yaa akbar ko parajeet bana dene se aap itihaas nahin badal dete, itihaas jab shiksha mantri ke aadesh se badalane lage to samajhie ki vah mantri chemistry kaa bhi acha vidhyaarthee nahin rahaa hoga
 Can you accept sitting here at Harvard and change the history by having a minister come to the class room of history
 professor ke haath se kitaab lekar, apni kitaab padhane ke liye de de
 Will you tolerate How can you do it for India when you can't afford it for yourself? zarur itihaas main nai bahes chalani chahie, nae shodh hone chahie
 But we are doing so
 ek film par hamane teen maheene bahes kii he
 We did not debate so much on India's poverty, did not debate India's prospects, we debated a film for three months
 talavaarein lekar log studio main aa gaye, ab kisi din bandooken lekar aaenge
 Even after the defeat of Maharana, people were accepted as great conquerors
 unki veerta kii gaatha par us haar kaa koi asar hi nahin tha, jise ek shiksha mantri ne apni takat se badalane kii koshish kii
 There is a big defeat in books for the unbeatable Maharana in folk legends
 mujhe nahin lagata ki maharana pratap jaise bahadur kaagaz par haar kii jagah jeet likh dene se khush hote
 The one who is brave also embraces defeat
 par yah sahi he ki public main itihaas ko lekar waisi samaj nahin he jaisi class room main he
 There is heavy disharmony in the class room as well
 itihaas ke lakhon chaatro ko acchhee kitaaben nahin milin, shikshak nahin mili isliye sabane kitaab kii jagah kooda uthaa liya
 Litter understood history
 ham aaj bhi itihaas ko gaurav gaan or gaurav bhav ke bina nahin samaj pate hai
 The gold bird was our country
 vishwa guru tha desh
 These are all adjectives, not history
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 However, the number of historians born in India in this three months, Oxford and Cambridge could not have been born in their history of several hundred years
 bharat main aap bas jalaakar, poster fadkar itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 You can become a historian by stopping the performance of a film
 teen saal main hamane jinte itihaaskaar paidaa kiye hai, unke liye ab hamaare paas utani universti bhi nahin hai
 It was the imagination of the British to convert the history of India to Hindu history into Muslim history
 aaj bahut se log angrezi hukumat kii soch ko puraa kar rahe hai
 They are taking history back into the mold of Hindu versus Muslim
 vartmaan par pardaa daalane ke liye itihaas se vaise mudde laae ja rahe hai jinke zarie naagarik kaa, matadaata kaa dharmik pahchaan banaai ja sake
 Why do we ever seek our Indianness in unity in diversity, in religious uniformity? Why don't we get our identity from the Constitution, for which we fought for a hundred years
 din raat bahes kiye, lakhon log jail gaye
 If many feel that this question should be debated, are we rightly placing our questions, arguing, will these forums be the anchors not reading the newspaper
 akhir kyon bahusankhyak dharm itihaas ke kirdaaron par dharmik vyakhya thopanaa chahta he? kabhi media ke spes main hamaari bhartiyata mili sur meraa tumhaara se banati thi, aaj hamaara sur hamaara, tumhaara sur tumhaara yaa tumhaara sur kuch nahin, hamaara hi sur tumhaara
 We Indians are going through both a crisis and a sense of being an Indian
 hamen ek khandit naagarikta ke bodh ke saath taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 Within which such political programming is being done through fake news and fake history that people can be triggered in small groups in any city
 kya aap itihaas kaa badla le sakate hai to phir aap nyaay kii mul avadharana ke khilaaf ja rahe hai jo kahata he ki khun kaa badla khun nahin hota he
 If we go to the concept of blood revenge, then violence will be violence all around us
 is samay bharat main do tarah ke polytical aaidentity hai
 One who is armed with religious aggression and the other has lost religious confidence
 ek daraane vaala he or daraa hua he
 This imbalance is going to bring many challenges in front of us which we recognize very well
 hamane iske nattejey dekhe hai, bhugte bhi hai
 Different communities pay at different times
 hamaari smritiyon se puraane zakhm mitate bhi nahin ki ham nae zakhm le aate hai
 Like India is a two in one country
 jise hamaari sarkari jubaan main india or bharat ke rup main pahchaan mil chuki he
 In the same way, our identity is based on two in one religion and caste
 aap in jati sanghathanon kii taraf se bharat ko dekhie, aap uskaa cheharaa sabake saamne dekh nahin paaenge
 You see the face of the caste secretly at home
 hamane jati ko khatm nahin kiya
 We have created new new CAST COLONIES in free India
 ye CAST COLONIES CONCRETE kii hai
 Its head is a people born in that modern India
 puuchhie khud se ki aaj kyon samaaj main ye jati coloni ban rahi hai
 Today does not mean 2018 nor 2014
 ham bharat kaa gaurav karte hai, dharm kaa gaurav karte hai, jati kaa gaurav karte hai
 We want to save all the cruelty within us
 kya jati vaaki gaurav karne kii chiz he? is sawaal kaa jawaab agar haa he to ham samvidhan ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai, apane rashtriya andolan kii bhaavana ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai
 The political slogan of Team India has changed to Cast India, Religion India
 andhra pradesh main brahn jati kii ek koparative sosayadi bani he
 Its mission is to revive and carry forward the legacy of Brahmins
 brahmanon kii viraasat kya he, rajputon kii viraasat kya he? to phir daliton kii viraasat bhima koregaanv se kya dikkat he? phir mughalon kii viraasat se kya dikkat he jahaan israel ke raashtra pramukh bhi apni patni ke saath do pal guzaarana chaahate hai

 mukhyamantri chandra babu naidu isaki patrika laanch kar rahe hai kyonki is sosayadi kaa mukhiya unki party kaa sadsy he
 The goals of this society are what the government should have
 jo hamaari aarthik nitiyon ke hone chahie
 Are our policies failing so much that now we have started making our own castes cooperative
 iskaa lakshya he garib brahman jatiyon kaa self helf group bananaa, unhen bijness karne, gaadi kharidne kaa lone dena
 Its members can only be from the Brahmin community
 iees hai, peshewar log hai
 Its chairman Anand Surya is also a Brahmin
 apana parichay main khud ko trade union netaa or bijnesaman likhte hai
 Business men rarely become trade union leaders in the world
 ve bijepi, bhartiya mazdoor sangh, janata dal, samaajawaadee janata party, janata dal secular main rah chuke hai
 Where he has learned how to give moral and political support to the Brahmin community
 hamen pataa hi nahin tha samaajawaadee party main log ye sab bhi sikhte hai
 He has been in TDP since 2003
 yah akelaa aisa santhaan nahin he
 Many such caste organizations are established in foreign countries as well as in India
 inke adhyakshon kii raajnneetik haisiyat kisi netaa se adhik he
 Without this space it is impossible to become a leader without such identification
 bangaloru main to 2013 main sirf brahmanon ke liye vaidic sosayadi banani shuru ho gai thi
 Think a township is only of Brahmins
 ye excluzan hamen kahaan le jayega, kya yah ek tarah kaa gheto nahin he
 2700 houses will be separate from Brahmins
 ye to phir se gaanvon vaala system ho jayega
 Of Brahmins separately
 kya yah gheto nahin he? Why did this happen in free India? When the housing society expanded in the eighties, it was settled on the basis of caste and particular profession
 dilli main patpadganj he, vahaan par jati, pesha, ilaaka or rajya ke hisaab se kai houseing sosayadi aapako milegi
 Then how were we becoming Indians based on the Constitution
 kya bina jati ke samarthan ke ham bhartiya nahin ho sakate
 There are different hostels of castes in Vidyanagar, Jaipur
 shri rajput sabha ne apni jati ke ladakon ke liye hostel banaae hai
 They also have girls
 yadavon ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Meena caste also has separate hostels
 brahman jati ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Now you tell me, whoever goes beyond these hostels will put forward their identity within themselves
 kya uski pahchaan kaa samvidhan aadhaarit bhartiyata se takaraav nahin hoga? khatic chatrawas bhi he jo sarkaar ne banaae hai
 Why did state governments need to create separate hostels for Dalits? Has the upper strata of our castes not yet accepted India on the basis of the constitution, does it not like constitution-based citizenship? Is there any group of castes that want to regain their supremacy with the help of religion? Is there any group that is now challenging this domination with many times more power than before? bharat kii raajnneeti kii tarah media bhi inhen cast colony se aata he
 Its editors also come from the same cast colony
 unhen public main jati kii pahchaan thik nahin lagati magar unhen dharm kii pahchaan thik lagati he
 That is why they are promoting the identity of caste through the identity of religion
 yah kaam vahi kar saktaa he jo loktantr main yakeen nahin rakhata ho kyonki jati loktantr ke kilaaf he
 All is not well in the Government of Media
 positive yahi he ki loktantr ke kilaaf yah puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Is speaking freely against brotherhood
 hamaari garvanment of media azaad he
 Free than ever
 isi positive note par main apana bhaashan samaapt kar rahaa hum
 Overall, we are promoting the status quo
 dharm ke gaurav ko ham raashtra bataa rahe hai
 If you wish, you can reject Darwin
 aap chahen to ganesh puja ko hi medical college kii padhai ghoshit kar sakate hai
 Thanks to you all
 itani dur se bulaayaa wo bhi sunne ke liye jab koi kisi kii nahin sun rahaa he
 The credibility of the interview has fallen so much that now only speech and standup comedy are supported

 main yahaan government of media tak hi simit rahoonga taaki kisi ko bura na lage ki maine videsh main garvanment of india ke bare main kuch kah diya
 It depends on you how much difference you can make between listening to me and the media
 ek ko janata ne chunaa he or duusare ne khud ko sarkaar ke liye chun liya he
 One is elected by vote and one is rated
 yahaan america main media he, bharat main godi media he
 i do not want to prolong my speech by giving one example, nor do i intend to embarrass you
 garvanment of media main bahut kuch acha he
 Like weather news
 accident kii khabaren
 Saina and Sindhu win, Dangal being a super hit
 aisa nahin he ki kuch bhi acha nahin he
 Millions of young men are standing in line for 14 posts of peons, who says there is hope
 collejon main chah chah saal main bie karne vaale lakhon noujvaan intazaar kar rahe hai, koun kahata he ki ummid nahin bachi he
 There is only hope that these young men are left behind
 ek daraa hua patrkaar loktantr main mara hua naagarik paidaa karata he
 a scared journalist becomes your hero, that means you have given fear to your home
 is vakt bharat ke loktantr ko bharat ke media se khatara he
 India's TV media has turned against democracy
 bharat kaa print media chupchaap us qatl main shaamil he jisamen bahata hua koon to nahin dikhataa he, magar idhar-udhar kone main chhaapi ja rahi kuch kaam kii khabaron main qatl kii aah sunai de jaati he
 The death of CBI court judge BH Loya is proof of who the Indian media is with
 kairavaan patrika kii report aane ke baad dilli ke ankar aasmaan kii taraf dekhne lage or hawaaon main nami kii maatra vaali khabaren padhane lage the
 Even opposition parties have become victims of this fear
 unke netaaon ko badi der baad himmat ai ki jaj loya kii maut ke sawaalon kii jaanch kii maang kii jaae
 When the courage came, the bench of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was hearing the case of Judge Loya
 iske baad bhi congress party ne jab jaj loya se sambandhit purv jajon kii maut par sawaal uthaaya to use dilli ke akhbaaron ne nahin chapa, channelon ne nahin dikhaaya
 It is not that the Government of Media forgot to ask questions
 usne rahul gandhi ke star vars dekhne par kitna bada sawaal kiya tha
 You can say that the Government of India wants Sirius to be the Leader of the Opposition
 lekin jab vah netaa sirius hokar jaj loya ko lekar press conference kar detaa he to media apana siriyasnes bhul jaataa he
 Remember friends, i am talking about the Government of Media, not the Government of India abroad
 media main kya koi khud se dar gaya he yaa kisi ke daraane se dar gaya he, yah ek khulaa prashn he
 Fear has nothing to do with DNA, anyone can be afraid, especially in a fake case and hanging lawsuits for many years where it is easy, fear is part of the system
 dar natural he
 Gandhi went to jail and freed us from the fear of jail
 ghulaam bharat ke garib se garib or anpadh se anpadh log jail ke dar se azaad ho gaye
 There was a scam of 2 lakh crores in 2G, but when the accused are acquitted, they have not been able to speak till date
 jinaki kitaab kaa naam he NOT JUST AN ACCOUNTANT, THE DIARY OF NATIONS CONSCIENCE KEEPER
 When the 2G accused were acquitted, the CBI was unable to produce evidence when i first saw it, while hiding the cover of a book
 aapane dekha he aisa hote hue
 It seems that the book is saying that it turned out to be true that they are not just accountants, but it is a lie that they are the conscience keeper of the nations
 ek daraa hua media jab super power india kaa hedline lagaataa he tab mujhe us power se dar lagata he
 i want Guru to reach at least those colleges where 8500 girls study but 9 teachers to teach before becoming a world teacher
 phir aap kahenge ki kya kuch bhi acha nahin ho rahaa he
 Is it not good that our girls are passing BA even without teachers? kya aap aisa harvard main karke dikhaa sakate hai? cambridge main dikhaa sakate hai, oxford main dikhaa sakate hai, kya aap yel or colombia main aisa karke dikhaa sakate hai? Media has left the basic question of India
 isliye maine kaha ki itani dur se aakar main garvanment of media kii baat karuunga taaki aapako na lage ki main garvanment of india kii baat kar rahaa hum
 i am criticizing the media, not India
 aap i or m main kanfus mat kar janaa
 There are two channels of the same owner
 ek hi channel main do ankar hai
 One is spreading communalism, one is talking of farmers
 ek jhooth failaa rahaa he, ek tuuti sadakon kii baat kar rahaa he
 The question is from the questioner like us, like we do not have the answer
 aap unase puuchhie jo aap tak media ko lekar aate hai, jo aap tak india lekar aate hai
 Fake News is official news today
 news room main reporter samaapt ho chuke hai
 The reporter is used as a murderer
 ek channel main ek saansad ke pich chaar paanch reporter ek saath bhej diya
 It was seen that all the media was behind him
 yah nayaa daur he
 Scared media has come to scare you with its cameras
 channelon par sampradayikta bhadakaane vaale ankaron ko jagah mil rahi he
 These anchors have no question for the government, only one question is with everyone
 is sawaal kaa naam he hindu muslim queshchan, HMQ
 India's news anchors have become communal under the guise of nationalism
 is had tak ki jab udaipur main noujvaan bhagava jhanda lekar adaalat kii chat par chadh jate hai to ankar chup ho gaye hai
 Did we want such an India, want it? The constitution under which the court is under the same constitution, the media assumes the phase of its independence
 charnamrita to samajhate honge
 The Government of Media has the same agenda
 hindu muslim queshchan
 There is so much of fake news related to it that you can read on Alt News
com
 ab to phek news duusari taraf se banane lage hai
 My dear friends, believe me, media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 It is creating such an imbalance in the society, through its debates, is poisoning such a poison that creates an atmosphere of fear within our democracy
 jisase ek bheed kabhi bhi kahin bhi trigar ho jaati he or aapako overpavar kar detii he
 You would say what is so bad, nothing is good
 mujhe pataa he ki aapako bich bich main positive acha lagata he
 i will tell you a positive bharat kaa loktantr media ke jhuk jane se nahin jhuk jaataa he
 It will not disappear as media is lost
 vah na to apatkaal main jhukaa na vah godi media ke kaal main jhukegaa
 The democracy of India is our soul
 hamaara zamir he
 The soul is immortal
 aap gita pard sakate hai
 i am talking about the Government of Media
 aapaki tarah main bhi bharat ko lekar sapane dekhtaa hum
 But while awake saamne kii hakeekat hi mere liye sapana he
 i dream of an India that can face reality
 sochie zaraa ham aaj kal ateet ke sawaalon me kyon uljhe hai
 If we have to face these questions, then are we doing properly, is there a TV studio instead of facing these questions? Or is it a classroom, a conference room, and how will we face it, will we calculate today, will we commit murder today? So are you ready to deliver a killer from your home? This storm of hate will create a killer in every house, it can be your brother, can be a son, can be a friend, can be a neighbor, have you made up your mind? Have we learned how to face history? We are out in the class room, not in the street and TV studios to calculate history
 nehru ko musalmaan bana dene se yaa akbar ko parajeet bana dene se aap itihaas nahin badal dete, itihaas jab shiksha mantri ke aadesh se badalane lage to samajhie ki vah mantri chemistry kaa bhi acha vidhyaarthee nahin rahaa hoga
 Can you accept sitting here at Harvard and change the history by having a minister come to the class room of history
 professor ke haath se kitaab lekar, apni kitaab padhane ke liye de de
 Will you tolerate How can you do it for India when you can't afford it for yourself? zarur itihaas main nai bahes chalani chahie, nae shodh hone chahie
 But we are doing so
 ek film par hamane teen maheene bahes kii he
 We did not debate so much on India's poverty, did not debate India's prospects, we debated a film for three months
 talavaarein lekar log studio main aa gaye, ab kisi din bandooken lekar aaenge
 Even after the defeat of Maharana, people were accepted as great conquerors
 unki veerta kii gaatha par us haar kaa koi asar hi nahin tha, jise ek shiksha mantri ne apni takat se badalane kii koshish kii
 There is a big defeat in books for the unbeatable Maharana in folk legends
 mujhe nahin lagata ki maharana pratap jaise bahadur kaagaz par haar kii jagah jeet likh dene se khush hote
 The one who is brave also embraces defeat
 par yah sahi he ki public main itihaas ko lekar waisi samaj nahin he jaisi class room main he
 There is heavy disharmony in the class room as well
 itihaas ke lakhon chaatro ko acchhee kitaaben nahin milin, shikshak nahin mili isliye sabane kitaab kii jagah kooda uthaa liya
 Litter understood history
 ham aaj bhi itihaas ko gaurav gaan or gaurav bhav ke bina nahin samaj pate hai
 The gold bird was our country
 vishwa guru tha desh
 These are all adjectives, not history
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 However, the number of historians born in India in this three months, Oxford and Cambridge could not have been born in their history of several hundred years
 bharat main aap bas jalaakar, poster fadkar itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 You can become a historian by stopping the performance of a film
 teen saal main hamane jinte itihaaskaar paidaa kiye hai, unke liye ab hamaare paas utani universti bhi nahin hai
 It was the imagination of the British to convert the history of India to Hindu history into Muslim history
 aaj bahut se log angrezi hukumat kii soch ko puraa kar rahe hai
 They are taking history back into the mold of Hindu versus Muslim
 vartmaan par pardaa daalane ke liye itihaas se vaise mudde laae ja rahe hai jinke zarie naagarik kaa, matadaata kaa dharmik pahchaan banaai ja sake
 Why do we ever seek our Indianness in unity in diversity, in religious uniformity? Why don't we get our identity from the Constitution, for which we fought for a hundred years
 din raat bahes kiye, lakhon log jail gaye
 If many feel that this question should be debated, are we rightly placing our questions, arguing, will these forums be the anchors not reading the newspaper
 akhir kyon bahusankhyak dharm itihaas ke kirdaaron par dharmik vyakhya thopanaa chahta he? kabhi media ke spes main hamaari bhartiyata mili sur meraa tumhaara se banati thi, aaj hamaara sur hamaara, tumhaara sur tumhaara yaa tumhaara sur kuch nahin, hamaara hi sur tumhaara
 We Indians are going through both a crisis and a sense of being an Indian
 hamen ek khandit naagarikta ke bodh ke saath taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 Within which such political programming is being done through fake news and fake history that people can be triggered in small groups in any city
 kya aap itihaas kaa badla le sakate hai to phir aap nyaay kii mul avadharana ke khilaaf ja rahe hai jo kahata he ki khun kaa badla khun nahin hota he
 If we go to the concept of blood revenge, then violence will be violence all around us
 is samay bharat main do tarah ke polytical aaidentity hai
 One who is armed with religious aggression and the other has lost religious confidence
 ek daraane vaala he or daraa hua he
 This imbalance is going to bring many challenges in front of us which we recognize very well
 hamane iske nattejey dekhe hai, bhugte bhi hai
 Different communities pay at different times
 hamaari smritiyon se puraane zakhm mitate bhi nahin ki ham nae zakhm le aate hai
 Like India is a two in one country
 jise hamaari sarkari jubaan main india or bharat ke rup main pahchaan mil chuki he
 In the same way, our identity is based on two in one religion and caste
 aap in jati sanghathanon kii taraf se bharat ko dekhie, aap uskaa cheharaa sabake saamne dekh nahin paaenge
 You see the face of the caste secretly at home
 hamane jati ko khatm nahin kiya
 We have created new new CAST COLONIES in free India
 ye CAST COLONIES CONCRETE kii hai
 Its head is a people born in that modern India
 puuchhie khud se ki aaj kyon samaaj main ye jati coloni ban rahi hai
 Today does not mean 2018 nor 2014
 ham bharat kaa gaurav karte hai, dharm kaa gaurav karte hai, jati kaa gaurav karte hai
 We want to save all the cruelty within us
 kya jati vaaki gaurav karne kii chiz he? is sawaal kaa jawaab agar haa he to ham samvidhan ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai, apane rashtriya andolan kii bhaavana ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai
 The political slogan of Team India has changed to Cast India, Religion India
 andhra pradesh main brahn jati kii ek koparative sosayadi bani he
 Its mission is to revive and carry forward the legacy of Brahmins
 brahmanon kii viraasat kya he, rajputon kii viraasat kya he? to phir daliton kii viraasat bhima koregaanv se kya dikkat he? phir mughalon kii viraasat se kya dikkat he jahaan israel ke raashtra pramukh bhi apni patni ke saath do pal guzaarana chaahate hai
 You can visit the Society's website http: / / www

 Go to com
 mukhyamantri chandra babu naidu isaki patrika laanch kar rahe hai kyonki is sosayadi kaa mukhiya unki party kaa sadsy he
 The goals of this society are what the government should have
 jo hamaari aarthik nitiyon ke hone chahie
 Are our policies failing so much that now we have started making our own castes cooperative
 iskaa lakshya he garib brahman jatiyon kaa self helf group bananaa, unhen bijness karne, gaadi kharidne kaa lone dena
 Its members can only be from the Brahmin community
 iees hai, peshewar log hai
 Its chairman Anand Surya is also a Brahmin
 apana parichay main khud ko trade union netaa or bijnesaman likhte hai
 Business men rarely become trade union leaders in the world
 ve bijepi, bhartiya mazdoor sangh, janata dal, samaajawaadee janata party, janata dal secular main rah chuke hai
 Where he has learned how to give moral and political support to the Brahmin community
 hamen pataa hi nahin tha samaajawaadee party main log ye sab bhi sikhte hai
 He has been in TDP since 2003
 yah akelaa aisa santhaan nahin he
 Many such caste organizations are established in foreign countries as well as in India
 inke adhyakshon kii raajnneetik haisiyat kisi netaa se adhik he
 Without this space it is impossible to become a leader without such identification
 bangaloru main to 2013 main sirf brahmanon ke liye vaidic sosayadi banani shuru ho gai thi
 Think a township is only of Brahmins
 ye excluzan hamen kahaan le jayega, kya yah ek tarah kaa gheto nahin he
 2700 houses will be separate from Brahmins
 ye to phir se gaanvon vaala system ho jayega
 Of Brahmins separately
 kya yah gheto nahin he? Why did this happen in free India? When the housing society expanded in the eighties, it was settled on the basis of caste and particular profession
 dilli main patpadganj he, vahaan par jati, pesha, ilaaka or rajya ke hisaab se kai houseing sosayadi aapako milegi
 Then how were we becoming Indians based on the Constitution
 kya bina jati ke samarthan ke ham bhartiya nahin ho sakate
 There are different hostels of castes in Vidyanagar, Jaipur
 shri rajput sabha ne apni jati ke ladakon ke liye hostel banaae hai
 They also have girls
 yadavon ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Meena caste also has separate hostels
 brahman jati ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Now you tell me, whoever goes beyond these hostels will put forward their identity within themselves
 kya uski pahchaan kaa samvidhan aadhaarit bhartiyata se takaraav nahin hoga? khatic chatrawas bhi he jo sarkaar ne banaae hai
 Why did state governments need to create separate hostels for Dalits? Has the upper strata of our castes not yet accepted India on the basis of the constitution, does it not like constitution-based citizenship? Is there any group of castes that want to regain their supremacy with the help of religion? Is there any group that is now challenging this domination with many times more power than before? bharat kii raajnneeti kii tarah media bhi inhen cast colony se aata he
 Its editors also come from the same cast colony
 unhen public main jati kii pahchaan thik nahin lagati magar unhen dharm kii pahchaan thik lagati he
 That is why they are promoting the identity of caste through the identity of religion
 yah kaam vahi kar saktaa he jo loktantr main yakeen nahin rakhata ho kyonki jati loktantr ke kilaaf he
 All is not well in the Government of Media
 positive yahi he ki loktantr ke kilaaf yah puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Is speaking freely against brotherhood
 hamaari garvanment of media azaad he
 Free than ever
 isi positive note par main apana bhaashan samaapt kar rahaa hum
 Overall, we are promoting the status quo
 dharm ke gaurav ko ham raashtra bataa rahe hai
 If you wish, you can reject Darwin
 aap chahen to ganesh puja ko hi medical college kii padhai ghoshit kar sakate hai
 One has been chosen by the public and the other has chosen itself for the government
 ek kaa chunaav vot se hua he or ek kaa reating se hota rahata he
 There is media here in America, dock media in India
 main ek-ek udhaaharan dekar apana bhaashan lanbaa nahin karnaa chahta or na hi aapako sharminda karne kaa meraa koi iraadaa he
 There is a lot of good in the Government of Media
 jaise mausam kaa samachar
 News of the accident cyna or sindhu kaa jeetna, dangal kaa superhit hona
 It is not that nothing is good
 chaparasi ke 14 padon ke liye lakhon noujvaan line main khadey hai, koun kahata he ummid nahin he
 Millions of young people who are doing BA in colleges in six years are waiting, who says that there is no hope left
 ummid hi to bachi hui he ki uske peeche ye noujvaan bache hue hai
 a scared journalist produces a dead citizen in a democracy
 ek daraa hua patrkaar aapkaa hero ban jaae, iskaa matlab aapane dar ko apana ghar de diya he
 At this time, India's democracy is threatened by the media of India
 bharat kaa tivi media loktantr ke kilaaf ho gaya he
 The print media of India is quietly involved in a murder that does not see a flowing blood, but some of the work being printed in the corner is heard in the news of murder
 sibiai court ke jaj bi ech loya kii maut is baat kaa pramaan he ki bharat kaa media kiske saath he
 After the report of Caravan magazine, the anchors of Delhi started looking at the sky and reading the news of moisture content in the winds
 yahaan tak ki is dar kaa shikaar vipakshi partiyaan bhi ho gayi hai
 Their leaders dared after a long time to demand an inquiry into the questions of Judge Loya's death
 jab himmat ai tab supreme court ke chif justise kii bench jaj loya ke maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi thi
 Even after this, when the Congress party questioned the death of former judges related to Judge Loya, it was not published by the newspapers in Delhi, the channels did not show
 aisa nahin he ki garvanment of media sawaal karnaa bhul gaya
 How big a question did he ask on watching Rahul Gandhi's Star Wars
 aap kah sakate hai ki garvanment of india chaahati he ki vipaksh kaa netaa sirius rahe
 But when the leader confronts Sirius and holds a press conference about Judge Loya, the media forgets its Sirius
 doston yaad rakhana main garvanment of media kii baat kar rahaa hum, videsh main garvanment of india kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 In the media, is anyone scared of himself or scared of scaring someone, it is an open question
 dar kaa diene se koi lenaa dena nahin he, koi bhi dar saktaa he, khaaskar farzi cese main fansaana or kai saal tak mukademon ko latakaana jahaan aasaan ho, vahaan dar system kaa part he
 Fear is natural
 gandhi ne jail jaakar hamen jail ke dar se azaad kara diya
 Slave The poor of the poor and the illiterate from the poor and the illiterate of India were freed from the fear of jail
 2ji main do lakh karod kaa ghotaalaa hua tha, magar jab iske aaropee bari ho gaye to wo janaab aaj tak nahin bol paae hai
 Whose book is named NOT JUST AN ACCOUNTANT, THE DIARY OF NATIONS CONSCIENCE KEEPER
 jab 2ji ke aaropee bari hue, sibiai saboot pesh nahin kar pai tab maine pehali baar dekha, kisi kitaab ko cover ko chhipate hue
 You have seen this happen
 lagata he ki kitaab kah rahi he ki ye baat sahi nikali ki ye sirf accountint nahin hai, magar ye baat jhooth he ki ve neshans ke kanshiens keeper hai
 i am scared of that power when a scared media puts the headline of Super Power India
 main chahta hum ki vishwa guru banane se pehle kam se kam un collejon main guru pahunch jaaen, jahaan 8500 ladkiyaan padhati hai magar padhaane ke liye 9 teacher hai
 Then you will say if nothing good is happening
 kya yah acha nahin he ki bina teacher ke bhi hamaari ladkiyaan bie paas kar ja rahi hai
 Can you do this in Howard? Can show in Cambridge, show in Oxford, can you do it in Yale and Columbia? media ne india ke basic queshchan ko chhod diya he
 So i said that coming from so far, i will talk about the Government of Media so that you do not feel that i am talking about the Government of India
 main india kii nahin media kii aalochana kar rahaa hum
 Do not get confused between i and M
 ek hi maalik ke do channel hai
 There are two anchors in the same channel
 ek sampradayikta failaa rahaa he, ek kisaanon kii baat kar rahaa he
 One is spreading lies, one is talking of broken roads
 sawaal, ham jaise sawaal karne vaale se he, jawaab ham jaison ke paas nahin he
 You ask those who bring the media to you, who bring you to India
 phek news aaj oficial news he
 Reporters in the newsroom have finished
 reporter kaa istemaal hatyare ke rup main hota he
 In a channel, four mps sent five reporters together behind one MP
 dekhne se laga ki sara media uske peeche padaa he
 This is the new era
 daraa hua media apane camaron se aapako daraane niklaa he
 The anchors that are inciting communalism on the channels are getting space
 in ankaron ke paas sarkaar ke liye koi sawaal nahin he, sirf ek hi queshchan sabake paas he
 The name of this question is Hindu Muslim Question, HMQ
 bharat ke news ankar rashtrawaad kii aad main sampradayik ho chuke hai
 To the extent that when the youth in Udaipur climb the roof of the court carrying the saffron flag, the anchors are silent
 kya ham aisa bharat chaahate the, chaahate hai? adaalat jis samvidhan ke tahat he, usee samvidhan kii ek dhara se media apni azaadi kaa charnamrita grahan karata he
 Charanamrit must have understood
 garvanment of media ke paas ek hi agenda he
 Hindu Muslim Question
 isse jude phek news kii itani bharmaar he ki aap alt news dot in par pard sakate hai
 Now fake news has started being made from the other side
 My dear friends, believe me, Media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 yah samaaj main aisa asantulan paidaa kar rahaa he, apni bahason ke zarie aisa zehar bo rahaa he jisase hamaare loktantr ke bheetar bhay kaa maahaul bana rahe
 Which triggers a rush anytime anywhere and overpowers you
 aap kahenge ki kya itnaa bura he, kuch bhi acha nahin he
 i know you like positive poses from time to time
 ek positive bataata hum
 India's democracy is not bent by the media's bowing down
 vah media ke mit jane se nahin mit jayega
 He neither bowed in emergency nor he would bow during the era of dock media
 bharat kaa loktantr hamaari aatma he
 We have a conscience
 aatma amar he
 You can read the Gita
 main garvanment of media kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Like you, i also dream about India
 magar jaagate hue
 The reality in front of me is a dream
 main ek aise bharat kaa sapana dekhtaa hum jo hakeekat kaa saamana kar sake
 Think about why we are entangled in questions of the past these days
 agar in sawaalon kaa saamana hi karnaa he to kya ham thik se kar rahe hai, kya in sawaalon kaa saamana karne kii jagah tivi kaa studio he? yaa classroom he, conference room hai, or saamana ham kis tarah se karenge, kya ham aaj hisaab karenge, kya ham aaj qatleam karenge? to kya aap apane ghar se ek hatyara dene ke liye taiyaar hai? nafrat kii yah aandhi har ghar main ek hatyara paidaa kar jaaegi, wo aapkaa bhai ho saktaa he, betaa ho saktaa he, dost ho saktaa he, padosi ho saktaa he, kya aapane man bana liya he? kya hamane siikhaa he ki itihaas kaa saamana kaise kiya jaae? ham class room main nahin, sadak or tivi studio main itihaas kaa hisaab karne nikle hai
 You do not change history by making Nehru a Muslim or by defeating Akbar, when history starts to change by the order of the Minister of Education, then understand that he would not have been a good student of the Chemistry
 kya aap yahaan harvard main baithkar is baat ko sweekaar kar sakate hai ki itihaas ke class room main koi mantri aakar itihaas badal de
 Take the book from the professor's hand and give it to read
 kya aap bardaasht karenge? jab aap khud ke liye yah bardaasht nahin kar sakate to bharat ke liye kaise kar sakate hai? There must be a new debate in history, there should be new research
 lekin ham vaisaa kar rahe hai
 We have debated for three months on a film
 itani bahes hamane bharat kii garibi par nahin kii, bharat kii sambhaavnaaon par nahin kii, hamane teen maheene ek film par bahes kii
 People came to the studio with swords, now someday will bring guns
 maharana kii haar ke baad bhi logon ne mahaan vijeta ke rup main sweekaar kiya tha
 His heroic saga had no effect on the defeat which an Education Minister tried to replace with his strength
 lok shrutiyon main aparaajey maharana ke liye kitabon main badi haar he
 i do not think that brave soldiers like Maharana Pratap would have been happy to write victory instead of defeat
 jo vir hota he wo haar ko bhi gale lagaataa he
 But it is true that the public does not understand the history as it is in the class room
 class room main bhi baari asamnata he
 Millions of students of history did not get good books, teachers could not find them, so they took the garbage in place of books
 kooday ko itihaas samaj liya
 Even today, we do not understand history without pride and pride
 sone kii chidiya tha hamaara desh
 The country was the world master
 ye sab visheshan hai, itihaas nahin he
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 vaise is teen maheene main bharat me jitne itihaaskaar paidaa hue hai, utane oxford or cambridge apane kai sau saal ke itihaas main paidaa nahin kar paae honge
 In India, you can become a historian just by burning, tearing posters
 kisi film kaa pradarshan rukvaa kar aap itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 For the historians we have produced in three years, now we do not even have that much diversity
 angrezon kii kalpana thi ki bharat ke itihaas ko hindu itihaas muslim itihaas main badal do
 Today many people are fulfilling the idea of english rule
 wo waapas itihaas ko hindu banaam musalmaan ke khaanche main le ja rahe hai
 To cover the present, issues are being brought from history through which the religious identity of the citizen and voter can be created
 ham kyon apni bhartiyata kabhi anekta main ekta main khojate khojate, dharmik ekarupata main khojane lagate hai? ham samvidhan se apni pahchaan kyon nahin hasil karte, jiske liye hamane sau saal kii ladaai ladi
 Argued day and night, millions of people went to jail
 agar bahuton ko lagata he ki is sawaal par bahes honi chahie to kya ham sahi tareeke se apane sawaal rakh rahe hai, bahes kar rahe hai, kya uskaa manch akhbaar tak na padhane vaale ye ankar honge
 After all, why does the majority religion want to impose religious interpretation on the characters of history? Once our Indianness was found in the media space, my voice was made with yours, today our tone is ours, your note is yours or your tone is nothing, our voice is yours
 ham bharatiyon kaa bhartiya hone kaa bodh or itihaas bodh donon sankat se guzar rahaa he
 We are being prepared with a sense of a fragmented citizenship
 jiske bheetar phek news or phek history ke zarie aisi politicil programing kii ja rahi he ki kisi bhi shahar main chote chote samooh main logon ko trigar kiya ja saktaa he
 Can you avenge history, then you are going against the basic concept of justice which says that blood is not revenge blood
 agar ham khun kaa badla khun kii avadharana par jaaenge to hamaare chaaron taraf hinsa hi hinsa hogi
 There are two types of political identity in India at this time
 ek jo dharmik aakraamakata se las he or doosraa to dharmik aatmavishvaas kho chukaa he
 One is intimidating and frightened
 yah asantulan aane vaale samay main hamaare saamne kai chunautiyaan laane vaala hai jinhen ham koob pahachaanate hai
 We have seen its consequences, we also pay
 alag-alag samay par alag-alag samudaayon ne bhugte hai
 Old wounds are not erased from our memories that we bring new wounds
 jaise hindustan ek tu in van desh he
 Which has been recognized as India and India in our official tongue
 usee tarah hamaari pahchaan dharm or jati ke tu in van par aadhaarit he
 You look at India from these caste organizations, you will not be able to see its face in front of everyone
 aap jati kaa cheharaa chupake se ghar jaakar dekhte hai
 We did not end caste
 hamane azaad bharat main nai nai CAST COLONIES banaai hai
 These belong to CAST COLONIES CONCRETE
 iske mukhiya us aadhunik bharat main paidaa hue log hai
 Ask yourself why these castes are becoming colonies in society today
 aaj kaa matlab 2018 nahin or na hi 2014 he
 We pride India, pride of religion, pride of caste
 ham apane bheetar har tarah kii krurta ko bachaate rahanaa chaahate hai
 Is caste really a matter of pride? If the answer to this question is yes, then we are cheating with the Constitution, betraying the spirit of our national movement
 team india kaa raajnneetik slogan cast india, religen india main badal chukaa he
 a cooperative society of Brahmins has been formed in Andhra Pradesh
 iskaa mishan he brahmanon kii viraasat ko dobaaraa se jivit karnaa or use aage badhanaa
 What is the heritage of Brahmins, what is the heritage of Rajputs? Then what is the problem with Bhima Koregaon, the legacy of Dalits? Then what is the problem with the legacy of the Mughals, where the Israeli head of state also wants to spend two moments with his wife
 aap is sosayadi kii website http: / / www
 apbrahmincoop
 com par jaaiye
 Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu is launching its magazine because the head of this society is a member of his party
 is sosayadi ke lakshya vahiin hai jo ek sarkaar ke hone chahie
 Which should be our economic policies
 kya hamaari nitiyaan is kadar fail rahi hai ki ab ham apni apni jatiyon kaa koparative banane lage hai
 Its goal is to form a self-help group of poor Brahmin castes, give them loans to do business, buy cars
 iske sadsy sirf brahman samudaay se ho sakate hai
 There are IAS, professional people
 iske cheiman anand surya bhi brahman hai
 In his introduction, he calls himself a trade union leader and businessman
 duniya main bijanes main shaayad hi trade union netaa banate hai
 He has lived in BJP, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Janata Dal, Samajwadi Janata Party, Janata Dal Secular
 jahaan unhone siikhaa he ki brahn samudaay ko naitik or raajnneetik samarthan kaise dena he
 We did not know that people in Samajwadi Party also learn all this
 2003 se ve tidipi main hai
 It is not the only such institution
 videshon main bhi or bharat main bhi aise anek jatigat sanghathan kaayam hai
 The political status of their presidents is more than any leader
 is spes ke baahar bina is tarah kii pahchaan ke liye netaa bananaa asambhav he
 In 2013, Vedic Society for Brahmins was started in Bangalore
 sochie ek township he sirf brahmanon kaa
 Where will this exclusion take us, is it not a kind of ghetto? 2700 ghar brahamanon ke alag se honge
 This will become a system of villages again
 brahmanon kaa alag se
 Isn't it ghetto? azaad bharat main yah kyon hua? assi ke dashak main jab houseing sosayadi kaa vistaar hua to use jati or khaas peshey ke aadhaar par basaaya gaya
 There is Patparganj in Delhi, there you will find many housing societies according to caste, occupation, region and state
 to phir ham samvidhan ke aadhaar par bhartiya kaise ban rahe the
 Can we not be an Indian without caste support? jaipur ke vidyanagar main jatiyon ke alag alag hostel bane hai
 Shri Rajput Sabha has built hostels for boys of its caste
 ladakiyon ke bhi hai
 The Yadavas also have separate hostels
 meena jati ke bhi alag chatravaas hai
 Brahmin caste also has separate hostels
 ab aap bataayen, in hostel se nikal jo bhi aage jayega wo apane bheetar kiski pahchaan ko aage rakhega
 Will his identity not clash with Constitution-based Indianness? There is also the Khatik studentship which the government has made
 kyon rajya sarkaron ko daliton ke liye alag se hostel banane kii zarurat padi? kya hamaari jatiyon ke oonche tabake ne samvidhan ke aadhaar par bharat ko abhi tak sweekaar nahin kiya he, kya vah samvidhan aadhaarit naagarikta ko pasand nahin karata he? kya jatiyon ko koi aisa samooh he jo dharm ke sahare apana varchasv phir se hasil karnaa chahta he? kya koi aisa bhi samooh he jo ab pehle se kai guna zyaada takat se is varchasv ko chunauti de rahaa he?tippaniyan Like India's politics, the media also comes from these cast colonies
 uske sampadak bhi isi cast colony se aate hai
 They do not like the identity of caste in public but they like the identity of religion
 isliye ve dharm kii pahchaan ke zarie jati kii pahchaan thel rahe hai
 This work can only be done by those who do not believe in democracy because caste is against democracy
 garvanment of media main sab kuch thik nahin he
 The positive is that it is speaking freely against democracy
 bhaichaare ke kilaaf puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Our Government of Media is free
 pehle se kahin azaad he
 i am ending my speech on this positive note
 kul milakar ham yathasthiti ko pramot kar rahe hai
 We are calling the pride of religion a nation
 aap chahen to darwin ko riject kar sakate hai
 If you want, you can declare Ganesh Pooja as a medical college
 ek daraa hua patrkaar loktantr main mara hua naagarik paidaa karata he
 a scared journalist becomes your hero, that means you have given fear to your home
 is vakt bharat ke loktantr ko bharat ke media se khatara he
 India's TV media has turned against democracy
 bharat kaa print media chupchaap us qatl main shaamil he jisamen bahata hua koon to nahin dikhataa he, magar idhar-udhar kone main chhaapi ja rahi kuch kaam kii khabaron main qatl kii aah sunai de jaati he
 The death of CBI court judge BH Loya is proof of who the Indian media is with
 kairavaan patrika kii report aane ke baad dilli ke ankar aasmaan kii taraf dekhne lage or hawaaon main nami kii maatra vaali khabaren padhane lage the
 Even opposition parties have become victims of this fear
 unke netaaon ko badi der baad himmat ai ki jaj loya kii maut ke sawaalon kii jaanch kii maang kii jaae
 When the courage came, the bench of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was hearing the case of Judge Loya
 iske baad bhi congress party ne jab jaj loya se sambandhit purv jajon kii maut par sawaal uthaaya to use dilli ke akhbaaron ne nahin chapa, channelon ne nahin dikhaaya
 It is not that the Government of Media forgot to ask questions
 usne rahul gandhi ke star vars dekhne par kitna bada sawaal kiya tha
 You can say that the Government of India wants Sirius to be the Leader of the Opposition
 lekin jab vah netaa sirius hokar jaj loya ko lekar press conference kar detaa he to media apana siriyasnes bhul jaataa he
 Remember friends, i am talking about the Government of Media, not the Government of India abroad
 media main kya koi khud se dar gaya he yaa kisi ke daraane se dar gaya he, yah ek khulaa prashn he
 Fear has nothing to do with DNA, anyone can be afraid, especially in a fake case and hanging lawsuits for many years where it is easy, fear is part of the system
 dar natural he
 Gandhi went to jail and freed us from the fear of jail
 ghulaam bharat ke garib se garib or anpadh se anpadh log jail ke dar se azaad ho gaye
 There was a scam of 2 lakh crores in 2G, but when the accused are acquitted, they have not been able to speak till date
 jinaki kitaab kaa naam he NOT JUST AN ACCOUNTANT, THE DIARY OF NATIONS CONSCIENCE KEEPER
 When the 2G accused were acquitted, the CBI was unable to produce evidence when i first saw it, while hiding the cover of a book
 aapane dekha he aisa hote hue
 It seems that the book is saying that it turned out to be true that they are not just accountants, but it is a lie that they are the conscience keeper of the nations
 ek daraa hua media jab super power india kaa hedline lagaataa he tab mujhe us power se dar lagata he
 i want Guru to reach at least those colleges where 8500 girls study but 9 teachers to teach before becoming a world teacher
 phir aap kahenge ki kya kuch bhi acha nahin ho rahaa he
 Is it not good that our girls are passing BA even without teachers? kya aap aisa harvard main karke dikhaa sakate hai? cambridge main dikhaa sakate hai, oxford main dikhaa sakate hai, kya aap yel or colombia main aisa karke dikhaa sakate hai? Media has left the basic question of India
 isliye maine kaha ki itani dur se aakar main garvanment of media kii baat karuunga taaki aapako na lage ki main garvanment of india kii baat kar rahaa hum
 i am criticizing the media, not India
 aap i or m main kanfus mat kar janaa
 There are two channels of the same owner
 ek hi channel main do ankar hai
 One is spreading communalism, one is talking of farmers
 ek jhooth failaa rahaa he, ek tuuti sadakon kii baat kar rahaa he
 The question is from the questioner like us, like we do not have the answer
 aap unase puuchhie jo aap tak media ko lekar aate hai, jo aap tak india lekar aate hai
 Fake News is official news today
 news room main reporter samaapt ho chuke hai
 The reporter is used as a murderer
 ek channel main ek saansad ke pich chaar paanch reporter ek saath bhej diya
 It was seen that all the media was behind him
 yah nayaa daur he
 Scared media has come to scare you with its cameras
 channelon par sampradayikta bhadakaane vaale ankaron ko jagah mil rahi he
 These anchors have no question for the government, only one question is with everyone
 is sawaal kaa naam he hindu muslim queshchan, HMQ
 India's news anchors have become communal under the guise of nationalism
 is had tak ki jab udaipur main noujvaan bhagava jhanda lekar adaalat kii chat par chadh jate hai to ankar chup ho gaye hai
 Did we want such an India, want it? The constitution under which the court is under the same constitution, the media assumes the phase of its independence
 charnamrita to samajhate honge
 The Government of Media has the same agenda
 hindu muslim queshchan
 There is so much of fake news related to it that you can read on Alt News
com
 ab to phek news duusari taraf se banane lage hai
 My dear friends, believe me, media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 It is creating such an imbalance in the society, through its debates, is poisoning such a poison that creates an atmosphere of fear within our democracy
 jisase ek bheed kabhi bhi kahin bhi trigar ho jaati he or aapako overpavar kar detii he
 You would say what is so bad, nothing is good
 mujhe pataa he ki aapako bich bich main positive acha lagata he
 i will tell you a positive bharat kaa loktantr media ke jhuk jane se nahin jhuk jaataa he
 It will not disappear as media is lost
 vah na to apatkaal main jhukaa na vah godi media ke kaal main jhukegaa
 The democracy of India is our soul
 hamaara zamir he
 The soul is immortal
 aap gita pard sakate hai
 i am talking about the Government of Media
 aapaki tarah main bhi bharat ko lekar sapane dekhtaa hum
 But while awake saamne kii hakeekat hi mere liye sapana he
 i dream of an India that can face reality
 sochie zaraa ham aaj kal ateet ke sawaalon me kyon uljhe hai
 If we have to face these questions, then are we doing properly, is there a TV studio instead of facing these questions? Or is it a classroom, a conference room, and how will we face it, will we calculate today, will we commit murder today? So are you ready to deliver a killer from your home? This storm of hate will create a killer in every house, it can be your brother, can be a son, can be a friend, can be a neighbor, have you made up your mind? Have we learned how to face history? We are out in the class room, not in the street and TV studios to calculate history
 nehru ko musalmaan bana dene se yaa akbar ko parajeet bana dene se aap itihaas nahin badal dete, itihaas jab shiksha mantri ke aadesh se badalane lage to samajhie ki vah mantri chemistry kaa bhi acha vidhyaarthee nahin rahaa hoga
 Can you accept sitting here at Harvard and change the history by having a minister come to the class room of history
 professor ke haath se kitaab lekar, apni kitaab padhane ke liye de de
 Will you tolerate How can you do it for India when you can't afford it for yourself? zarur itihaas main nai bahes chalani chahie, nae shodh hone chahie
 But we are doing so
 ek film par hamane teen maheene bahes kii he
 We did not debate so much on India's poverty, did not debate India's prospects, we debated a film for three months
 talavaarein lekar log studio main aa gaye, ab kisi din bandooken lekar aaenge
 Even after the defeat of Maharana, people were accepted as great conquerors
 unki veerta kii gaatha par us haar kaa koi asar hi nahin tha, jise ek shiksha mantri ne apni takat se badalane kii koshish kii
 There is a big defeat in books for the unbeatable Maharana in folk legends
 mujhe nahin lagata ki maharana pratap jaise bahadur kaagaz par haar kii jagah jeet likh dene se khush hote
 The one who is brave also embraces defeat
 par yah sahi he ki public main itihaas ko lekar waisi samaj nahin he jaisi class room main he
 There is heavy disharmony in the class room as well
 itihaas ke lakhon chaatro ko acchhee kitaaben nahin milin, shikshak nahin mili isliye sabane kitaab kii jagah kooda uthaa liya
 Litter understood history
 ham aaj bhi itihaas ko gaurav gaan or gaurav bhav ke bina nahin samaj pate hai
 The gold bird was our country
 vishwa guru tha desh
 These are all adjectives, not history
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 However, the number of historians born in India in this three months, Oxford and Cambridge could not have been born in their history of several hundred years
 bharat main aap bas jalaakar, poster fadkar itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 You can become a historian by stopping the performance of a film
 teen saal main hamane jinte itihaaskaar paidaa kiye hai, unke liye ab hamaare paas utani universti bhi nahin hai
 It was the imagination of the British to convert the history of India to Hindu history into Muslim history
 aaj bahut se log angrezi hukumat kii soch ko puraa kar rahe hai
 They are taking history back into the mold of Hindu versus Muslim
 vartmaan par pardaa daalane ke liye itihaas se vaise mudde laae ja rahe hai jinke zarie naagarik kaa, matadaata kaa dharmik pahchaan banaai ja sake
 Why do we ever seek our Indianness in unity in diversity, in religious uniformity? Why don't we get our identity from the Constitution, for which we fought for a hundred years
 din raat bahes kiye, lakhon log jail gaye
 If many feel that this question should be debated, are we rightly placing our questions, arguing, will these forums be the anchors not reading the newspaper
 akhir kyon bahusankhyak dharm itihaas ke kirdaaron par dharmik vyakhya thopanaa chahta he? kabhi media ke spes main hamaari bhartiyata mili sur meraa tumhaara se banati thi, aaj hamaara sur hamaara, tumhaara sur tumhaara yaa tumhaara sur kuch nahin, hamaara hi sur tumhaara
 We Indians are going through both a crisis and a sense of being an Indian
 hamen ek khandit naagarikta ke bodh ke saath taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 Within which such political programming is being done through fake news and fake history that people can be triggered in small groups in any city
 kya aap itihaas kaa badla le sakate hai to phir aap nyaay kii mul avadharana ke khilaaf ja rahe hai jo kahata he ki khun kaa badla khun nahin hota he
 If we go to the concept of blood revenge, then violence will be violence all around us
 is samay bharat main do tarah ke polytical aaidentity hai
 One who is armed with religious aggression and the other has lost religious confidence
 ek daraane vaala he or daraa hua he
 This imbalance is going to bring many challenges in front of us which we recognize very well
 hamane iske nattejey dekhe hai, bhugte bhi hai
 Different communities pay at different times
 hamaari smritiyon se puraane zakhm mitate bhi nahin ki ham nae zakhm le aate hai
 Like India is a two in one country
 jise hamaari sarkari jubaan main india or bharat ke rup main pahchaan mil chuki he
 In the same way, our identity is based on two in one religion and caste
 aap in jati sanghathanon kii taraf se bharat ko dekhie, aap uskaa cheharaa sabake saamne dekh nahin paaenge
 You see the face of the caste secretly at home
 hamane jati ko khatm nahin kiya
 We have created new new CAST COLONIES in free India
 ye CAST COLONIES CONCRETE kii hai
 Its head is a people born in that modern India
 puuchhie khud se ki aaj kyon samaaj main ye jati coloni ban rahi hai
 Today does not mean 2018 nor 2014
 ham bharat kaa gaurav karte hai, dharm kaa gaurav karte hai, jati kaa gaurav karte hai
 We want to save all the cruelty within us
 kya jati vaaki gaurav karne kii chiz he? is sawaal kaa jawaab agar haa he to ham samvidhan ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai, apane rashtriya andolan kii bhaavana ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai
 The political slogan of Team India has changed to Cast India, Religion India
 andhra pradesh main brahn jati kii ek koparative sosayadi bani he
 Its mission is to revive and carry forward the legacy of Brahmins
 brahmanon kii viraasat kya he, rajputon kii viraasat kya he? to phir daliton kii viraasat bhima koregaanv se kya dikkat he? phir mughalon kii viraasat se kya dikkat he jahaan israel ke raashtra pramukh bhi apni patni ke saath do pal guzaarana chaahate hai

 Go to com
 mukhyamantri chandra babu naidu isaki patrika laanch kar rahe hai kyonki is sosayadi kaa mukhiya unki party kaa sadsy he
 The goals of this society are what the government should have
 jo hamaari aarthik nitiyon ke hone chahie
 Are our policies failing so much that now we have started making our own castes cooperative
 iskaa lakshya he garib brahman jatiyon kaa self helf group bananaa, unhen bijness karne, gaadi kharidne kaa lone dena
 Its members can only be from the Brahmin community
 iees hai, peshewar log hai
 Its chairman Anand Surya is also a Brahmin
 apana parichay main khud ko trade union netaa or bijnesaman likhte hai
 Business men rarely become trade union leaders in the world
 ve bijepi, bhartiya mazdoor sangh, janata dal, samaajawaadee janata party, janata dal secular main rah chuke hai
 Where he has learned how to give moral and political support to the Brahmin community
 hamen pataa hi nahin tha samaajawaadee party main log ye sab bhi sikhte hai
 He has been in TDP since 2003
 yah akelaa aisa santhaan nahin he
 Many such caste organizations are established in foreign countries as well as in India
 inke adhyakshon kii raajnneetik haisiyat kisi netaa se adhik he
 Without this space it is impossible to become a leader without such identification
 bangaloru main to 2013 main sirf brahmanon ke liye vaidic sosayadi banani shuru ho gai thi
 Think a township is only of Brahmins
 ye excluzan hamen kahaan le jayega, kya yah ek tarah kaa gheto nahin he
 2700 houses will be separate from Brahmins
 ye to phir se gaanvon vaala system ho jayega
 Of Brahmins separately
 kya yah gheto nahin he? Why did this happen in free India? When the housing society expanded in the eighties, it was settled on the basis of caste and particular profession
 dilli main patpadganj he, vahaan par jati, pesha, ilaaka or rajya ke hisaab se kai houseing sosayadi aapako milegi
 Then how were we becoming Indians based on the Constitution
 kya bina jati ke samarthan ke ham bhartiya nahin ho sakate
 There are different hostels of castes in Vidyanagar, Jaipur
 shri rajput sabha ne apni jati ke ladakon ke liye hostel banaae hai
 They also have girls
 yadavon ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Meena caste also has separate hostels
 brahman jati ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Now you tell me, whoever goes beyond these hostels will put forward their identity within themselves
 kya uski pahchaan kaa samvidhan aadhaarit bhartiyata se takaraav nahin hoga? khatic chatrawas bhi he jo sarkaar ne banaae hai
 Why did state governments need to create separate hostels for Dalits? Has the upper strata of our castes not yet accepted India on the basis of the constitution, does it not like constitution-based citizenship? Is there any group of castes that want to regain their supremacy with the help of religion? Is there any group that is now challenging this domination with many times more power than before? bharat kii raajnneeti kii tarah media bhi inhen cast colony se aata he
 Its editors also come from the same cast colony
 unhen public main jati kii pahchaan thik nahin lagati magar unhen dharm kii pahchaan thik lagati he
 That is why they are promoting the identity of caste through the identity of religion
 yah kaam vahi kar saktaa he jo loktantr main yakeen nahin rakhata ho kyonki jati loktantr ke kilaaf he
 All is not well in the Government of Media
 positive yahi he ki loktantr ke kilaaf yah puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Is speaking freely against brotherhood
 hamaari garvanment of media azaad he
 Free than ever
 isi positive note par main apana bhaashan samaapt kar rahaa hum
 Overall, we are promoting the status quo
 dharm ke gaurav ko ham raashtra bataa rahe hai
 If you wish, you can reject Darwin
 aap chahen to ganesh puja ko hi medical college kii padhai ghoshit kar sakate hai
 The death of CBI court judge BH Loya is proof of who the Indian media is with

 akhir kyon bahusankhyak dharm itihaas ke kirdaaron par dharmik vyakhya thopanaa chahta he? kabhi media ke spes main hamaari bhartiyata mili sur meraa tumhaara se banati thi, aaj hamaara sur hamaara, tumhaara sur tumhaara yaa tumhaara sur kuch nahin, hamaara hi sur tumhaara
 We Indians are going through both a crisis and a sense of being an Indian

 is samay bharat main do tarah ke polytical aaidentity hai

 In the same way, our identity is based on two in one religion and caste
 aap in jati sanghathanon kii taraf se bharat ko dekhie, aap uskaa cheharaa sabake saamne dekh nahin paaenge
 You see the face of the caste secretly at home
 hamane jati ko khatm nahin kiya
 We have created new new CAST COLONIES in free India
 ye CAST COLONIES CONCRETE kii hai
 Its head is a people born in that modern India
 puuchhie khud se ki aaj kyon samaaj main ye jati coloni ban rahi hai
 Today does not mean 2018 nor 2014
 ham bharat kaa gaurav karte hai, dharm kaa gaurav karte hai, jati kaa gaurav karte hai
 We want to save all the cruelty within us
 kya jati vaaki gaurav karne kii chiz he? is sawaal kaa jawaab agar haa he to ham samvidhan ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai, apane rashtriya andolan kii bhaavana ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai
 The political slogan of Team India has changed to Cast India, Religion India
 andhra pradesh main brahn jati kii ek koparative sosayadi bani he
 Its mission is to revive and carry forward the legacy of Brahmins
 brahmanon kii viraasat kya he, rajputon kii viraasat kya he? to phir daliton kii viraasat bhima koregaanv se kya dikkat he? phir mughalon kii viraasat se kya dikkat he jahaan israel ke raashtra pramukh bhi apni patni ke saath do pal guzaarana chaahate hai

 yah akelaa aisa santhaan nahin he
 Many such caste organizations are established in foreign countries as well as in India
 inke adhyakshon kii raajnneetik haisiyat kisi netaa se adhik he
 Without this space it is impossible to become a leader without such identification
 bangaloru main to 2013 main sirf brahmanon ke liye vaidic sosayadi banani shuru ho gai thi
 Think a township is only of Brahmins
 ye excluzan hamen kahaan le jayega, kya yah ek tarah kaa gheto nahin he
 2700 houses will be separate from Brahmins
 ye to phir se gaanvon vaala system ho jayega
 Of Brahmins separately
 kya yah gheto nahin he? Why did this happen in free India? When the housing society expanded in the eighties, it was settled on the basis of caste and particular profession
 dilli main patpadganj he, vahaan par jati, pesha, ilaaka or rajya ke hisaab se kai houseing sosayadi aapako milegi
 Then how were we becoming Indians based on the Constitution
 kya bina jati ke samarthan ke ham bhartiya nahin ho sakate
 There are different hostels of castes in Vidyanagar, Jaipur
 shri rajput sabha ne apni jati ke ladakon ke liye hostel banaae hai
 They also have girls
 yadavon ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Meena caste also has separate hostels
 brahman jati ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Now you tell me, whoever goes beyond these hostels will put forward their identity within themselves
 kya uski pahchaan kaa samvidhan aadhaarit bhartiyata se takaraav nahin hoga? khatic chatrawas bhi he jo sarkaar ne banaae hai
 Why did state governments need to create separate hostels for Dalits? Has the upper strata of our castes not yet accepted India on the basis of the constitution, does it not like constitution-based citizenship? Is there any group of castes that want to regain their supremacy with the help of religion? Is there any group that is now challenging this domination with many times more power than before? bharat kii raajnneeti kii tarah media bhi inhen cast colony se aata he
 Its editors also come from the same cast colony
 unhen public main jati kii pahchaan thik nahin lagati magar unhen dharm kii pahchaan thik lagati he
 That is why they are promoting the identity of caste through the identity of religion
 yah kaam vahi kar saktaa he jo loktantr main yakeen nahin rakhata ho kyonki jati loktantr ke kilaaf he
 All is not well in the Government of Media
 positive yahi he ki loktantr ke kilaaf yah puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Is speaking freely against brotherhood
 hamaari garvanment of media azaad he
 Free than ever
 isi positive note par main apana bhaashan samaapt kar rahaa hum
 Overall, we are promoting the status quo
 dharm ke gaurav ko ham raashtra bataa rahe hai
 If you wish, you can reject Darwin
 aap chahen to ganesh puja ko hi medical college kii padhai ghoshit kar sakate hai
 It is not that the Government of Media forgot to ask questions
 usne rahul gandhi ke star vars dekhne par kitna bada sawaal kiya tha
 You can say that the Government of India wants Sirius to be the Leader of the Opposition
 lekin jab vah netaa sirius hokar jaj loya ko lekar press conference kar detaa he to media apana siriyasnes bhul jaataa he
 Remember friends, i am talking about the Government of Media, not the Government of India abroad
 media main kya koi khud se dar gaya he yaa kisi ke daraane se dar gaya he, yah ek khulaa prashn he
 Fear has nothing to do with DNA, anyone can be afraid, especially in a fake case and hanging lawsuits for many years where it is easy, fear is part of the system
 dar natural he
 Gandhi went to jail and freed us from the fear of jail
 ghulaam bharat ke garib se garib or anpadh se anpadh log jail ke dar se azaad ho gaye
 There was a scam of 2 lakh crores in 2G, but when the accused are acquitted, they have not been able to speak till date
 jinaki kitaab kaa naam he NOT JUST AN ACCOUNTANT, THE DIARY OF NATIONS CONSCIENCE KEEPER
 When the 2G accused were acquitted, the CBI was unable to produce evidence when i first saw it, while hiding the cover of a book
 aapane dekha he aisa hote hue
 It seems that the book is saying that it turned out to be true that they are not just accountants, but it is a lie that they are the conscience keeper of the nations
 ek daraa hua media jab super power india kaa hedline lagaataa he tab mujhe us power se dar lagata he
 i want Guru to reach at least those colleges where 8500 girls study but 9 teachers to teach before becoming a world teacher
 phir aap kahenge ki kya kuch bhi acha nahin ho rahaa he
 Is it not good that our girls are passing BA even without teachers? kya aap aisa harvard main karke dikhaa sakate hai? cambridge main dikhaa sakate hai, oxford main dikhaa sakate hai, kya aap yel or colombia main aisa karke dikhaa sakate hai? Media has left the basic question of India
 isliye maine kaha ki itani dur se aakar main garvanment of media kii baat karuunga taaki aapako na lage ki main garvanment of india kii baat kar rahaa hum
 i am criticizing the media, not India
 aap i or m main kanfus mat kar janaa
 There are two channels of the same owner
 ek hi channel main do ankar hai
 One is spreading communalism, one is talking of farmers
 ek jhooth failaa rahaa he, ek tuuti sadakon kii baat kar rahaa he
 The question is from the questioner like us, like we do not have the answer
 aap unase puuchhie jo aap tak media ko lekar aate hai, jo aap tak india lekar aate hai
 Fake News is official news today
 news room main reporter samaapt ho chuke hai
 The reporter is used as a murderer
 ek channel main ek saansad ke pich chaar paanch reporter ek saath bhej diya
 It was seen that all the media was behind him
 yah nayaa daur he
 Scared media has come to scare you with its cameras
 channelon par sampradayikta bhadakaane vaale ankaron ko jagah mil rahi he
 These anchors have no question for the government, only one question is with everyone
 is sawaal kaa naam he hindu muslim queshchan, HMQ
 India's news anchors have become communal under the guise of nationalism
 is had tak ki jab udaipur main noujvaan bhagava jhanda lekar adaalat kii chat par chadh jate hai to ankar chup ho gaye hai
 Did we want such an India, want it? The constitution under which the court is under the same constitution, the media assumes the phase of its independence
 charnamrita to samajhate honge
 The Government of Media has the same agenda
 hindu muslim queshchan
 There is so much of fake news related to it that you can read on Alt News
com
 ab to phek news duusari taraf se banane lage hai
 My dear friends, believe me, media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 It is creating such an imbalance in the society, through its debates, is poisoning such a poison that creates an atmosphere of fear within our democracy
 jisase ek bheed kabhi bhi kahin bhi trigar ho jaati he or aapako overpavar kar detii he
 You would say what is so bad, nothing is good
 mujhe pataa he ki aapako bich bich main positive acha lagata he
 i will tell you a positive bharat kaa loktantr media ke jhuk jane se nahin jhuk jaataa he
 It will not disappear as media is lost
 vah na to apatkaal main jhukaa na vah godi media ke kaal main jhukegaa
 The democracy of India is our soul
 hamaara zamir he
 The soul is immortal
 aap gita pard sakate hai
 i am talking about the Government of Media
 aapaki tarah main bhi bharat ko lekar sapane dekhtaa hum
 But while awake saamne kii hakeekat hi mere liye sapana he
 i dream of an India that can face reality
 sochie zaraa ham aaj kal ateet ke sawaalon me kyon uljhe hai
 If we have to face these questions, then are we doing properly, is there a TV studio instead of facing these questions? Or is it a classroom, a conference room, and how will we face it, will we calculate today, will we commit murder today? So are you ready to deliver a killer from your home? This storm of hate will create a killer in every house, it can be your brother, can be a son, can be a friend, can be a neighbor, have you made up your mind? Have we learned how to face history? We are out in the class room, not in the street and TV studios to calculate history
 nehru ko musalmaan bana dene se yaa akbar ko parajeet bana dene se aap itihaas nahin badal dete, itihaas jab shiksha mantri ke aadesh se badalane lage to samajhie ki vah mantri chemistry kaa bhi acha vidhyaarthee nahin rahaa hoga
 Can you accept sitting here at Harvard and change the history by having a minister come to the class room of history
 professor ke haath se kitaab lekar, apni kitaab padhane ke liye de de
 Will you tolerate How can you do it for India when you can't afford it for yourself? zarur itihaas main nai bahes chalani chahie, nae shodh hone chahie
 But we are doing so
 ek film par hamane teen maheene bahes kii he
 We did not debate so much on India's poverty, did not debate India's prospects, we debated a film for three months
 talavaarein lekar log studio main aa gaye, ab kisi din bandooken lekar aaenge
 Even after the defeat of Maharana, people were accepted as great conquerors
 unki veerta kii gaatha par us haar kaa koi asar hi nahin tha, jise ek shiksha mantri ne apni takat se badalane kii koshish kii
 There is a big defeat in books for the unbeatable Maharana in folk legends
 mujhe nahin lagata ki maharana pratap jaise bahadur kaagaz par haar kii jagah jeet likh dene se khush hote
 The one who is brave also embraces defeat
 par yah sahi he ki public main itihaas ko lekar waisi samaj nahin he jaisi class room main he
 There is heavy disharmony in the class room as well
 itihaas ke lakhon chaatro ko acchhee kitaaben nahin milin, shikshak nahin mili isliye sabane kitaab kii jagah kooda uthaa liya
 Litter understood history
 ham aaj bhi itihaas ko gaurav gaan or gaurav bhav ke bina nahin samaj pate hai
 The gold bird was our country
 vishwa guru tha desh
 These are all adjectives, not history
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 However, the number of historians born in India in this three months, Oxford and Cambridge could not have been born in their history of several hundred years
 bharat main aap bas jalaakar, poster fadkar itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 You can become a historian by stopping the performance of a film
 teen saal main hamane jinte itihaaskaar paidaa kiye hai, unke liye ab hamaare paas utani universti bhi nahin hai
 It was the imagination of the British to convert the history of India to Hindu history into Muslim history
 aaj bahut se log angrezi hukumat kii soch ko puraa kar rahe hai
 They are taking history back into the mold of Hindu versus Muslim
 vartmaan par pardaa daalane ke liye itihaas se vaise mudde laae ja rahe hai jinke zarie naagarik kaa, matadaata kaa dharmik pahchaan banaai ja sake
 Why do we ever seek our Indianness in unity in diversity, in religious uniformity? Why don't we get our identity from the Constitution, for which we fought for a hundred years
 din raat bahes kiye, lakhon log jail gaye
 If many feel that this question should be debated, are we rightly placing our questions, arguing, will these forums be the anchors not reading the newspaper

 Fear is natural
 gandhi ne jail jaakar hamen jail ke dar se azaad kara diya
 Slave The poor of the poor and the illiterate from the poor and the illiterate of India were freed from the fear of jail
 2ji main do lakh karod kaa ghotaalaa hua tha, magar jab iske aaropee bari ho gaye to wo janaab aaj tak nahin bol paae hai

 jab 2ji ke aaropee bari hue, sibiai saboot pesh nahin kar pai tab maine pehali baar dekha, kisi kitaab ko cover ko chhipate hue
 You have seen this happen
 lagata he ki kitaab kah rahi he ki ye baat sahi nikali ki ye sirf accountint nahin hai, magar ye baat jhooth he ki ve neshans ke kanshiens keeper hai
 i am scared of that power when a scared media puts the headline of Super Power India
 main chahta hum ki vishwa guru banane se pehle kam se kam un collejon main guru pahunch jaaen, jahaan 8500 ladkiyaan padhati hai magar padhaane ke liye 9 teacher hai
 Then you will say if nothing good is happening
 kya yah acha nahin he ki bina teacher ke bhi hamaari ladkiyaan bie paas kar ja rahi hai
 Can you do this in Howard? Can show in Cambridge, show in Oxford, can you do it in Yale and Columbia? media ne india ke basic queshchan ko chhod diya he
 So i said that coming from so far, i will talk about the Government of Media so that you do not feel that i am talking about the Government of India

 Do not get confused between i and M
 ek hi maalik ke do channel hai
 There are two anchors in the same channel
 ek sampradayikta failaa rahaa he, ek kisaanon kii baat kar rahaa he
 One is spreading lies, one is talking of broken roads
 sawaal, ham jaise sawaal karne vaale se he, jawaab ham jaison ke paas nahin he
 You ask those who bring the media to you, who bring you to India
 phek news aaj oficial news he
 Reporters in the newsroom have finished
 reporter kaa istemaal hatyare ke rup main hota he
 In a channel, four mps sent five reporters together behind one MP
 dekhne se laga ki sara media uske peeche padaa he
 This is the new era
 daraa hua media apane camaron se aapako daraane niklaa he
 The anchors that are inciting communalism on the channels are getting space
 in ankaron ke paas sarkaar ke liye koi sawaal nahin he, sirf ek hi queshchan sabake paas he
 The name of this question is Hindu Muslim Question, HMQ
 bharat ke news ankar rashtrawaad kii aad main sampradayik ho chuke hai
 To the extent that when the youth in Udaipur climb the roof of the court carrying the saffron flag, the anchors are silent
 kya ham aisa bharat chaahate the, chaahate hai? adaalat jis samvidhan ke tahat he, usee samvidhan kii ek dhara se media apni azaadi kaa charnamrita grahan karata he
 Charanamrit must have understood
 garvanment of media ke paas ek hi agenda he
 Hindu Muslim Question
 isse jude phek news kii itani bharmaar he ki aap alt news dot in par pard sakate hai
 Now fake news has started being made from the other side
 My dear friends, believe me, Media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 yah samaaj main aisa asantulan paidaa kar rahaa he, apni bahason ke zarie aisa zehar bo rahaa he jisase hamaare loktantr ke bheetar bhay kaa maahaul bana rahe
 Which triggers a rush anytime anywhere and overpowers you
 aap kahenge ki kya itnaa bura he, kuch bhi acha nahin he
 i know you like positive poses from time to time
 ek positive bataata hum
 India's democracy is not bent by the media's bowing down
 vah media ke mit jane se nahin mit jayega
 He neither bowed in emergency nor he would bow during the era of dock media
 bharat kaa loktantr hamaari aatma he
 We have a conscience
 aatma amar he
 You can read the Gita
 main garvanment of media kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Like you, i also dream about India
 magar jaagate hue
 The reality in front of me is a dream
 main ek aise bharat kaa sapana dekhtaa hum jo hakeekat kaa saamana kar sake
 Think about why we are entangled in questions of the past these days
 agar in sawaalon kaa saamana hi karnaa he to kya ham thik se kar rahe hai, kya in sawaalon kaa saamana karne kii jagah tivi kaa studio he? yaa classroom he, conference room hai, or saamana ham kis tarah se karenge, kya ham aaj hisaab karenge, kya ham aaj qatleam karenge? to kya aap apane ghar se ek hatyara dene ke liye taiyaar hai? nafrat kii yah aandhi har ghar main ek hatyara paidaa kar jaaegi, wo aapkaa bhai ho saktaa he, betaa ho saktaa he, dost ho saktaa he, padosi ho saktaa he, kya aapane man bana liya he? kya hamane siikhaa he ki itihaas kaa saamana kaise kiya jaae? ham class room main nahin, sadak or tivi studio main itihaas kaa hisaab karne nikle hai
 You do not change history by making Nehru a Muslim or by defeating Akbar, when history starts to change by the order of the Minister of Education, then understand that he would not have been a good student of the Chemistry
 kya aap yahaan harvard main baithkar is baat ko sweekaar kar sakate hai ki itihaas ke class room main koi mantri aakar itihaas badal de
 Take the book from the professor's hand and give it to read
 kya aap bardaasht karenge? jab aap khud ke liye yah bardaasht nahin kar sakate to bharat ke liye kaise kar sakate hai? There must be a new debate in history, there should be new research
 lekin ham vaisaa kar rahe hai
 We have debated for three months on a film
 itani bahes hamane bharat kii garibi par nahin kii, bharat kii sambhaavnaaon par nahin kii, hamane teen maheene ek film par bahes kii
 People came to the studio with swords, now someday will bring guns
 maharana kii haar ke baad bhi logon ne mahaan vijeta ke rup main sweekaar kiya tha
 His heroic saga had no effect on the defeat which an Education Minister tried to replace with his strength
 lok shrutiyon main aparaajey maharana ke liye kitabon main badi haar he
 i do not think that brave soldiers like Maharana Pratap would have been happy to write victory instead of defeat
 jo vir hota he wo haar ko bhi gale lagaataa he
 But it is true that the public does not understand the history as it is in the class room
 class room main bhi baari asamnata he
 Millions of students of history did not get good books, teachers could not find them, so they took the garbage in place of books
 kooday ko itihaas samaj liya
 Even today, we do not understand history without pride and pride
 sone kii chidiya tha hamaara desh
 The country was the world master
 ye sab visheshan hai, itihaas nahin he
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 vaise is teen maheene main bharat me jitne itihaaskaar paidaa hue hai, utane oxford or cambridge apane kai sau saal ke itihaas main paidaa nahin kar paae honge
 In India, you can become a historian just by burning, tearing posters
 kisi film kaa pradarshan rukvaa kar aap itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 For the historians we have produced in three years, now we do not even have that much diversity
 angrezon kii kalpana thi ki bharat ke itihaas ko hindu itihaas muslim itihaas main badal do
 Today many people are fulfilling the idea of english rule
 wo waapas itihaas ko hindu banaam musalmaan ke khaanche main le ja rahe hai
 To cover the present, issues are being brought from history through which the religious identity of the citizen and voter can be created
 ham kyon apni bhartiyata kabhi anekta main ekta main khojate khojate, dharmik ekarupata main khojane lagate hai? ham samvidhan se apni pahchaan kyon nahin hasil karte, jiske liye hamane sau saal kii ladaai ladi
 Argued day and night, millions of people went to jail
 agar bahuton ko lagata he ki is sawaal par bahes honi chahie to kya ham sahi tareeke se apane sawaal rakh rahe hai, bahes kar rahe hai, kya uskaa manch akhbaar tak na padhane vaale ye ankar honge
 After all, why does the majority religion want to impose religious interpretation on the characters of history? Once our Indianness was found in the media space, my voice was made with yours, today our tone is ours, your note is yours or your tone is nothing, our voice is yours
 ham bharatiyon kaa bhartiya hone kaa bodh or itihaas bodh donon sankat se guzar rahaa he
 We are being prepared with a sense of a fragmented citizenship
 jiske bheetar phek news or phek history ke zarie aisi politicil programing kii ja rahi he ki kisi bhi shahar main chote chote samooh main logon ko trigar kiya ja saktaa he
 Can you avenge history, then you are going against the basic concept of justice which says that blood is not revenge blood
 agar ham khun kaa badla khun kii avadharana par jaaenge to hamaare chaaron taraf hinsa hi hinsa hogi
 There are two types of political identity in India at this time
 ek jo dharmik aakraamakata se las he or doosraa to dharmik aatmavishvaas kho chukaa he
 One is intimidating and frightened
 yah asantulan aane vaale samay main hamaare saamne kai chunautiyaan laane vaala hai jinhen ham koob pahachaanate hai
 We have seen its consequences, we also pay
 alag-alag samay par alag-alag samudaayon ne bhugte hai
 Old wounds are not erased from our memories that we bring new wounds
 jaise hindustan ek tu in van desh he
 Which has been recognized as India and India in our official tongue
 usee tarah hamaari pahchaan dharm or jati ke tu in van par aadhaarit he
 You look at India from these caste organizations, you will not be able to see its face in front of everyone
 aap jati kaa cheharaa chupake se ghar jaakar dekhte hai
 We did not end caste
 hamane azaad bharat main nai nai CAST COLONIES banaai hai
 These belong to CAST COLONIES CONCRETE
 iske mukhiya us aadhunik bharat main paidaa hue log hai
 Ask yourself why these castes are becoming colonies in society today
 aaj kaa matlab 2018 nahin or na hi 2014 he
 We pride India, pride of religion, pride of caste
 ham apane bheetar har tarah kii krurta ko bachaate rahanaa chaahate hai
 Is caste really a matter of pride? If the answer to this question is yes, then we are cheating with the Constitution, betraying the spirit of our national movement
 team india kaa raajnneetik slogan cast india, religen india main badal chukaa he
 a cooperative society of Brahmins has been formed in Andhra Pradesh
 iskaa mishan he brahmanon kii viraasat ko dobaaraa se jivit karnaa or use aage badhanaa
 What is the heritage of Brahmins, what is the heritage of Rajputs? Then what is the problem with Bhima Koregaon, the legacy of Dalits? Then what is the problem with the legacy of the Mughals, where the Israeli head of state also wants to spend two moments with his wife
 aap is sosayadi kii website http: / / www
 apbrahmincoop
 com par jaaiye
 Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu is launching its magazine because the head of this society is a member of his party
 is sosayadi ke lakshya vahiin hai jo ek sarkaar ke hone chahie
 Which should be our economic policies
 kya hamaari nitiyaan is kadar fail rahi hai ki ab ham apni apni jatiyon kaa koparative banane lage hai
 Its goal is to form a self-help group of poor Brahmin castes, give them loans to do business, buy cars
 iske sadsy sirf brahman samudaay se ho sakate hai
 There are IAS, professional people
 iske cheiman anand surya bhi brahman hai
 In his introduction, he calls himself a trade union leader and businessman
 duniya main bijanes main shaayad hi trade union netaa banate hai
 He has lived in BJP, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Janata Dal, Samajwadi Janata Party, Janata Dal Secular
 jahaan unhone siikhaa he ki brahn samudaay ko naitik or raajnneetik samarthan kaise dena he
 We did not know that people in Samajwadi Party also learn all this
 2003 se ve tidipi main hai
 It is not the only such institution
 videshon main bhi or bharat main bhi aise anek jatigat sanghathan kaayam hai
 The political status of their presidents is more than any leader
 is spes ke baahar bina is tarah kii pahchaan ke liye netaa bananaa asambhav he
 In 2013, Vedic Society for Brahmins was started in Bangalore
 sochie ek township he sirf brahmanon kaa
 Where will this exclusion take us, is it not a kind of ghetto? 2700 ghar brahamanon ke alag se honge
 This will become a system of villages again
 brahmanon kaa alag se
 Isn't it ghetto? azaad bharat main yah kyon hua? assi ke dashak main jab houseing sosayadi kaa vistaar hua to use jati or khaas peshey ke aadhaar par basaaya gaya
 There is Patparganj in Delhi, there you will find many housing societies according to caste, occupation, region and state
 to phir ham samvidhan ke aadhaar par bhartiya kaise ban rahe the
 Can we not be an Indian without caste support? jaipur ke vidyanagar main jatiyon ke alag alag hostel bane hai
 Shri Rajput Sabha has built hostels for boys of its caste
 ladakiyon ke bhi hai
 The Yadavas also have separate hostels
 meena jati ke bhi alag chatravaas hai
 Brahmin caste also has separate hostels
 ab aap bataayen, in hostel se nikal jo bhi aage jayega wo apane bheetar kiski pahchaan ko aage rakhega
 Will his identity not clash with Constitution-based Indianness? There is also the Khatik studentship which the government has made
 kyon rajya sarkaron ko daliton ke liye alag se hostel banane kii zarurat padi? kya hamaari jatiyon ke oonche tabake ne samvidhan ke aadhaar par bharat ko abhi tak sweekaar nahin kiya he, kya vah samvidhan aadhaarit naagarikta ko pasand nahin karata he? kya jatiyon ko koi aisa samooh he jo dharm ke sahare apana varchasv phir se hasil karnaa chahta he? kya koi aisa bhi samooh he jo ab pehle se kai guna zyaada takat se is varchasv ko chunauti de rahaa he?tippaniyan Like India's politics, the media also comes from these cast colonies
 uske sampadak bhi isi cast colony se aate hai
 They do not like the identity of caste in public but they like the identity of religion
 isliye ve dharm kii pahchaan ke zarie jati kii pahchaan thel rahe hai
 This work can only be done by those who do not believe in democracy because caste is against democracy
 garvanment of media main sab kuch thik nahin he
 The positive is that it is speaking freely against democracy
 bhaichaare ke kilaaf puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Our Government of Media is free
 pehle se kahin azaad he
 i am ending my speech on this positive note
 kul milakar ham yathasthiti ko pramot kar rahe hai
 We are calling the pride of religion a nation
 aap chahen to darwin ko riject kar sakate hai
 If you want, you can declare Ganesh Pooja as a medical college
 ek daraa hua media jab super power india kaa hedline lagaataa he tab mujhe us power se dar lagata he
 i want Guru to reach at least those colleges where 8500 girls study but 9 teachers to teach before becoming a world teacher
 phir aap kahenge ki kya kuch bhi acha nahin ho rahaa he
 Is it not good that our girls are passing BA even without teachers? kya aap aisa harvard main karke dikhaa sakate hai? cambridge main dikhaa sakate hai, oxford main dikhaa sakate hai, kya aap yel or colombia main aisa karke dikhaa sakate hai? Media has left the basic question of India
 isliye maine kaha ki itani dur se aakar main garvanment of media kii baat karuunga taaki aapako na lage ki main garvanment of india kii baat kar rahaa hum
 i am criticizing the media, not India
 aap i or m main kanfus mat kar janaa
 There are two channels of the same owner
 ek hi channel main do ankar hai
 One is spreading communalism, one is talking of farmers
 ek jhooth failaa rahaa he, ek tuuti sadakon kii baat kar rahaa he
 The question is from the questioner like us, like we do not have the answer
 aap unase puuchhie jo aap tak media ko lekar aate hai, jo aap tak india lekar aate hai
 Fake News is official news today
 news room main reporter samaapt ho chuke hai
 The reporter is used as a murderer
 ek channel main ek saansad ke pich chaar paanch reporter ek saath bhej diya
 It was seen that all the media was behind him
 yah nayaa daur he
 Scared media has come to scare you with its cameras
 channelon par sampradayikta bhadakaane vaale ankaron ko jagah mil rahi he
 These anchors have no question for the government, only one question is with everyone
 is sawaal kaa naam he hindu muslim queshchan, HMQ
 India's news anchors have become communal under the guise of nationalism
 is had tak ki jab udaipur main noujvaan bhagava jhanda lekar adaalat kii chat par chadh jate hai to ankar chup ho gaye hai
 Did we want such an India, want it? The constitution under which the court is under the same constitution, the media assumes the phase of its independence
 charnamrita to samajhate honge
 The Government of Media has the same agenda
 hindu muslim queshchan
 There is so much of fake news related to it that you can read on Alt News
com
 ab to phek news duusari taraf se banane lage hai
 My dear friends, believe me, media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 It is creating such an imbalance in the society, through its debates, is poisoning such a poison that creates an atmosphere of fear within our democracy
 jisase ek bheed kabhi bhi kahin bhi trigar ho jaati he or aapako overpavar kar detii he
 You would say what is so bad, nothing is good
 mujhe pataa he ki aapako bich bich main positive acha lagata he
 i will tell you a positive bharat kaa loktantr media ke jhuk jane se nahin jhuk jaataa he
 It will not disappear as media is lost
 vah na to apatkaal main jhukaa na vah godi media ke kaal main jhukegaa
 The democracy of India is our soul
 hamaara zamir he
 The soul is immortal
 aap gita pard sakate hai
 i am talking about the Government of Media
 aapaki tarah main bhi bharat ko lekar sapane dekhtaa hum
 But while awake saamne kii hakeekat hi mere liye sapana he
 i dream of an India that can face reality
 sochie zaraa ham aaj kal ateet ke sawaalon me kyon uljhe hai
 If we have to face these questions, then are we doing properly, is there a TV studio instead of facing these questions? Or is it a classroom, a conference room, and how will we face it, will we calculate today, will we commit murder today? So are you ready to deliver a killer from your home? This storm of hate will create a killer in every house, it can be your brother, can be a son, can be a friend, can be a neighbor, have you made up your mind? Have we learned how to face history? We are out in the class room, not in the street and TV studios to calculate history
 nehru ko musalmaan bana dene se yaa akbar ko parajeet bana dene se aap itihaas nahin badal dete, itihaas jab shiksha mantri ke aadesh se badalane lage to samajhie ki vah mantri chemistry kaa bhi acha vidhyaarthee nahin rahaa hoga
 Can you accept sitting here at Harvard and change the history by having a minister come to the class room of history
 professor ke haath se kitaab lekar, apni kitaab padhane ke liye de de
 Will you tolerate How can you do it for India when you can't afford it for yourself? zarur itihaas main nai bahes chalani chahie, nae shodh hone chahie
 But we are doing so
 ek film par hamane teen maheene bahes kii he
 We did not debate so much on India's poverty, did not debate India's prospects, we debated a film for three months
 talavaarein lekar log studio main aa gaye, ab kisi din bandooken lekar aaenge
 Even after the defeat of Maharana, people were accepted as great conquerors
 unki veerta kii gaatha par us haar kaa koi asar hi nahin tha, jise ek shiksha mantri ne apni takat se badalane kii koshish kii
 There is a big defeat in books for the unbeatable Maharana in folk legends
 mujhe nahin lagata ki maharana pratap jaise bahadur kaagaz par haar kii jagah jeet likh dene se khush hote
 The one who is brave also embraces defeat
 par yah sahi he ki public main itihaas ko lekar waisi samaj nahin he jaisi class room main he
 There is heavy disharmony in the class room as well
 itihaas ke lakhon chaatro ko acchhee kitaaben nahin milin, shikshak nahin mili isliye sabane kitaab kii jagah kooda uthaa liya
 Litter understood history
 ham aaj bhi itihaas ko gaurav gaan or gaurav bhav ke bina nahin samaj pate hai
 The gold bird was our country
 vishwa guru tha desh
 These are all adjectives, not history
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 However, the number of historians born in India in this three months, Oxford and Cambridge could not have been born in their history of several hundred years
 bharat main aap bas jalaakar, poster fadkar itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 You can become a historian by stopping the performance of a film
 teen saal main hamane jinte itihaaskaar paidaa kiye hai, unke liye ab hamaare paas utani universti bhi nahin hai
 It was the imagination of the British to convert the history of India to Hindu history into Muslim history
 aaj bahut se log angrezi hukumat kii soch ko puraa kar rahe hai
 They are taking history back into the mold of Hindu versus Muslim
 vartmaan par pardaa daalane ke liye itihaas se vaise mudde laae ja rahe hai jinke zarie naagarik kaa, matadaata kaa dharmik pahchaan banaai ja sake
 Why do we ever seek our Indianness in unity in diversity, in religious uniformity? Why don't we get our identity from the Constitution, for which we fought for a hundred years
 din raat bahes kiye, lakhon log jail gaye
 If many feel that this question should be debated, are we rightly placing our questions, arguing, will these forums be the anchors not reading the newspaper
 akhir kyon bahusankhyak dharm itihaas ke kirdaaron par dharmik vyakhya thopanaa chahta he? kabhi media ke spes main hamaari bhartiyata mili sur meraa tumhaara se banati thi, aaj hamaara sur hamaara, tumhaara sur tumhaara yaa tumhaara sur kuch nahin, hamaara hi sur tumhaara
 We Indians are going through both a crisis and a sense of being an Indian
 hamen ek khandit naagarikta ke bodh ke saath taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 Within which such political programming is being done through fake news and fake history that people can be triggered in small groups in any city
 kya aap itihaas kaa badla le sakate hai to phir aap nyaay kii mul avadharana ke khilaaf ja rahe hai jo kahata he ki khun kaa badla khun nahin hota he
 If we go to the concept of blood revenge, then violence will be violence all around us
 is samay bharat main do tarah ke polytical aaidentity hai
 One who is armed with religious aggression and the other has lost religious confidence
 ek daraane vaala he or daraa hua he
 This imbalance is going to bring many challenges in front of us which we recognize very well
 hamane iske nattejey dekhe hai, bhugte bhi hai
 Different communities pay at different times
 hamaari smritiyon se puraane zakhm mitate bhi nahin ki ham nae zakhm le aate hai
 Like India is a two in one country
 jise hamaari sarkari jubaan main india or bharat ke rup main pahchaan mil chuki he
 In the same way, our identity is based on two in one religion and caste
 aap in jati sanghathanon kii taraf se bharat ko dekhie, aap uskaa cheharaa sabake saamne dekh nahin paaenge
 You see the face of the caste secretly at home
 hamane jati ko khatm nahin kiya
 We have created new new CAST COLONIES in free India
 ye CAST COLONIES CONCRETE kii hai
 Its head is a people born in that modern India
 puuchhie khud se ki aaj kyon samaaj main ye jati coloni ban rahi hai
 Today does not mean 2018 nor 2014
 ham bharat kaa gaurav karte hai, dharm kaa gaurav karte hai, jati kaa gaurav karte hai
 We want to save all the cruelty within us
 kya jati vaaki gaurav karne kii chiz he? is sawaal kaa jawaab agar haa he to ham samvidhan ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai, apane rashtriya andolan kii bhaavana ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai
 The political slogan of Team India has changed to Cast India, Religion India
 andhra pradesh main brahn jati kii ek koparative sosayadi bani he
 Its mission is to revive and carry forward the legacy of Brahmins
 brahmanon kii viraasat kya he, rajputon kii viraasat kya he? to phir daliton kii viraasat bhima koregaanv se kya dikkat he? phir mughalon kii viraasat se kya dikkat he jahaan israel ke raashtra pramukh bhi apni patni ke saath do pal guzaarana chaahate hai
 You can visit the Society's website http: / / www
 apbrahmincoop
 Go to com
 mukhyamantri chandra babu naidu isaki patrika laanch kar rahe hai kyonki is sosayadi kaa mukhiya unki party kaa sadsy he
 The goals of this society are what the government should have
 jo hamaari aarthik nitiyon ke hone chahie
 Are our policies failing so much that now we have started making our own castes cooperative
 iskaa lakshya he garib brahman jatiyon kaa self helf group bananaa, unhen bijness karne, gaadi kharidne kaa lone dena
 Its members can only be from the Brahmin community
 iees hai, peshewar log hai
 Its chairman Anand Surya is also a Brahmin
 apana parichay main khud ko trade union netaa or bijnesaman likhte hai
 Business men rarely become trade union leaders in the world
 ve bijepi, bhartiya mazdoor sangh, janata dal, samaajawaadee janata party, janata dal secular main rah chuke hai
 Where he has learned how to give moral and political support to the Brahmin community
 hamen pataa hi nahin tha samaajawaadee party main log ye sab bhi sikhte hai
 He has been in TDP since 2003
 yah akelaa aisa santhaan nahin he
 Many such caste organizations are established in foreign countries as well as in India
 inke adhyakshon kii raajnneetik haisiyat kisi netaa se adhik he
 Without this space it is impossible to become a leader without such identification
 bangaloru main to 2013 main sirf brahmanon ke liye vaidic sosayadi banani shuru ho gai thi
 Think a township is only of Brahmins
 ye excluzan hamen kahaan le jayega, kya yah ek tarah kaa gheto nahin he
 2700 houses will be separate from Brahmins
 ye to phir se gaanvon vaala system ho jayega
 Of Brahmins separately
 kya yah gheto nahin he? Why did this happen in free India? When the housing society expanded in the eighties, it was settled on the basis of caste and particular profession
 dilli main patpadganj he, vahaan par jati, pesha, ilaaka or rajya ke hisaab se kai houseing sosayadi aapako milegi
 Then how were we becoming Indians based on the Constitution
 kya bina jati ke samarthan ke ham bhartiya nahin ho sakate
 There are different hostels of castes in Vidyanagar, Jaipur
 shri rajput sabha ne apni jati ke ladakon ke liye hostel banaae hai
 They also have girls
 yadavon ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Meena caste also has separate hostels
 brahman jati ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Now you tell me, whoever goes beyond these hostels will put forward their identity within themselves
 kya uski pahchaan kaa samvidhan aadhaarit bhartiyata se takaraav nahin hoga? khatic chatrawas bhi he jo sarkaar ne banaae hai
 Why did state governments need to create separate hostels for Dalits? Has the upper strata of our castes not yet accepted India on the basis of the constitution, does it not like constitution-based citizenship? Is there any group of castes that want to regain their supremacy with the help of religion? Is there any group that is now challenging this domination with many times more power than before? bharat kii raajnneeti kii tarah media bhi inhen cast colony se aata he
 Its editors also come from the same cast colony
 unhen public main jati kii pahchaan thik nahin lagati magar unhen dharm kii pahchaan thik lagati he
 That is why they are promoting the identity of caste through the identity of religion
 yah kaam vahi kar saktaa he jo loktantr main yakeen nahin rakhata ho kyonki jati loktantr ke kilaaf he
 All is not well in the Government of Media
 positive yahi he ki loktantr ke kilaaf yah puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Is speaking freely against brotherhood
 hamaari garvanment of media azaad he
 Free than ever
 isi positive note par main apana bhaashan samaapt kar rahaa hum
 Overall, we are promoting the status quo
 dharm ke gaurav ko ham raashtra bataa rahe hai
 If you wish, you can reject Darwin
 aap chahen to ganesh puja ko hi medical college kii padhai ghoshit kar sakate hai
 Media has left the basic question of India
 isliye maine kaha ki itani dur se aakar main garvanment of media kii baat karuunga taaki aapako na lage ki main garvanment of india kii baat kar rahaa hum
 i am criticizing the media, not India
 aap i or m main kanfus mat kar janaa

 kya jati vaaki gaurav karne kii chiz he? is sawaal kaa jawaab agar haa he to ham samvidhan ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai, apane rashtriya andolan kii bhaavana ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai
 The political slogan of Team India has changed to Cast India, Religion India
 andhra pradesh main brahn jati kii ek koparative sosayadi bani he
 Its mission is to revive and carry forward the legacy of Brahmins
 brahmanon kii viraasat kya he, rajputon kii viraasat kya he? to phir daliton kii viraasat bhima koregaanv se kya dikkat he? phir mughalon kii viraasat se kya dikkat he jahaan israel ke raashtra pramukh bhi apni patni ke saath do pal guzaarana chaahate hai

 mukhyamantri chandra babu naidu isaki patrika laanch kar rahe hai kyonki is sosayadi kaa mukhiya unki party kaa sadsy he
 The goals of this society are what the government should have
 jo hamaari aarthik nitiyon ke hone chahie
 Are our policies failing so much that now we have started making our own castes cooperative
 iskaa lakshya he garib brahman jatiyon kaa self helf group bananaa, unhen bijness karne, gaadi kharidne kaa lone dena
 Its members can only be from the Brahmin community
 iees hai, peshewar log hai
 Its chairman Anand Surya is also a Brahmin
 apana parichay main khud ko trade union netaa or bijnesaman likhte hai
 Business men rarely become trade union leaders in the world
 ve bijepi, bhartiya mazdoor sangh, janata dal, samaajawaadee janata party, janata dal secular main rah chuke hai
 Where he has learned how to give moral and political support to the Brahmin community
 hamen pataa hi nahin tha samaajawaadee party main log ye sab bhi sikhte hai
 He has been in TDP since 2003
 yah akelaa aisa santhaan nahin he
 Many such caste organizations are established in foreign countries as well as in India
 inke adhyakshon kii raajnneetik haisiyat kisi netaa se adhik he
 Without this space it is impossible to become a leader without such identification
 bangaloru main to 2013 main sirf brahmanon ke liye vaidic sosayadi banani shuru ho gai thi
 Think a township is only of Brahmins
 ye excluzan hamen kahaan le jayega, kya yah ek tarah kaa gheto nahin he
 2700 houses will be separate from Brahmins
 ye to phir se gaanvon vaala system ho jayega
 Of Brahmins separately
 kya yah gheto nahin he? Why did this happen in free India? When the housing society expanded in the eighties, it was settled on the basis of caste and particular profession
 dilli main patpadganj he, vahaan par jati, pesha, ilaaka or rajya ke hisaab se kai houseing sosayadi aapako milegi
 Then how were we becoming Indians based on the Constitution
 kya bina jati ke samarthan ke ham bhartiya nahin ho sakate
 There are different hostels of castes in Vidyanagar, Jaipur
 shri rajput sabha ne apni jati ke ladakon ke liye hostel banaae hai
 They also have girls
 yadavon ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Meena caste also has separate hostels
 brahman jati ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Now you tell me, whoever goes beyond these hostels will put forward their identity within themselves
 kya uski pahchaan kaa samvidhan aadhaarit bhartiyata se takaraav nahin hoga? khatic chatrawas bhi he jo sarkaar ne banaae hai
 Why did state governments need to create separate hostels for Dalits? Has the upper strata of our castes not yet accepted India on the basis of the constitution, does it not like constitution-based citizenship? Is there any group of castes that want to regain their supremacy with the help of religion? Is there any group that is now challenging this domination with many times more power than before? bharat kii raajnneeti kii tarah media bhi inhen cast colony se aata he
 Its editors also come from the same cast colony
 unhen public main jati kii pahchaan thik nahin lagati magar unhen dharm kii pahchaan thik lagati he
 That is why they are promoting the identity of caste through the identity of religion
 yah kaam vahi kar saktaa he jo loktantr main yakeen nahin rakhata ho kyonki jati loktantr ke kilaaf he
 All is not well in the Government of Media
 positive yahi he ki loktantr ke kilaaf yah puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Is speaking freely against brotherhood
 hamaari garvanment of media azaad he
 Free than ever
 isi positive note par main apana bhaashan samaapt kar rahaa hum
 Overall, we are promoting the status quo
 dharm ke gaurav ko ham raashtra bataa rahe hai
 If you wish, you can reject Darwin
 aap chahen to ganesh puja ko hi medical college kii padhai ghoshit kar sakate hai
 There are two channels of the same owner
 ek hi channel main do ankar hai
 One is spreading communalism, one is talking of farmers
 ek jhooth failaa rahaa he, ek tuuti sadakon kii baat kar rahaa he
 The question is from the questioner like us, like we do not have the answer
 aap unase puuchhie jo aap tak media ko lekar aate hai, jo aap tak india lekar aate hai
 Fake News is official news today
 news room main reporter samaapt ho chuke hai
 The reporter is used as a murderer
 ek channel main ek saansad ke pich chaar paanch reporter ek saath bhej diya
 It was seen that all the media was behind him
 yah nayaa daur he
 Scared media has come to scare you with its cameras
 channelon par sampradayikta bhadakaane vaale ankaron ko jagah mil rahi he
 These anchors have no question for the government, only one question is with everyone
 is sawaal kaa naam he hindu muslim queshchan, HMQ
 India's news anchors have become communal under the guise of nationalism
 is had tak ki jab udaipur main noujvaan bhagava jhanda lekar adaalat kii chat par chadh jate hai to ankar chup ho gaye hai
 Did we want such an India, want it? The constitution under which the court is under the same constitution, the media assumes the phase of its independence
 charnamrita to samajhate honge
 The Government of Media has the same agenda
 hindu muslim queshchan
 There is so much of fake news related to it that you can read on Alt News
com
 ab to phek news duusari taraf se banane lage hai
 My dear friends, believe me, media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 It is creating such an imbalance in the society, through its debates, is poisoning such a poison that creates an atmosphere of fear within our democracy
 jisase ek bheed kabhi bhi kahin bhi trigar ho jaati he or aapako overpavar kar detii he
 You would say what is so bad, nothing is good
 mujhe pataa he ki aapako bich bich main positive acha lagata he
 i will tell you a positive bharat kaa loktantr media ke jhuk jane se nahin jhuk jaataa he
 It will not disappear as media is lost
 vah na to apatkaal main jhukaa na vah godi media ke kaal main jhukegaa
 The democracy of India is our soul
 hamaara zamir he
 The soul is immortal
 aap gita pard sakate hai
 i am talking about the Government of Media
 aapaki tarah main bhi bharat ko lekar sapane dekhtaa hum
 But while awake saamne kii hakeekat hi mere liye sapana he
 i dream of an India that can face reality
 sochie zaraa ham aaj kal ateet ke sawaalon me kyon uljhe hai
 If we have to face these questions, then are we doing properly, is there a TV studio instead of facing these questions? Or is it a classroom, a conference room, and how will we face it, will we calculate today, will we commit murder today? So are you ready to deliver a killer from your home? This storm of hate will create a killer in every house, it can be your brother, can be a son, can be a friend, can be a neighbor, have you made up your mind? Have we learned how to face history? We are out in the class room, not in the street and TV studios to calculate history
 nehru ko musalmaan bana dene se yaa akbar ko parajeet bana dene se aap itihaas nahin badal dete, itihaas jab shiksha mantri ke aadesh se badalane lage to samajhie ki vah mantri chemistry kaa bhi acha vidhyaarthee nahin rahaa hoga
 Can you accept sitting here at Harvard and change the history by having a minister come to the class room of history
 professor ke haath se kitaab lekar, apni kitaab padhane ke liye de de
 Will you tolerate How can you do it for India when you can't afford it for yourself? zarur itihaas main nai bahes chalani chahie, nae shodh hone chahie
 But we are doing so
 ek film par hamane teen maheene bahes kii he
 We did not debate so much on India's poverty, did not debate India's prospects, we debated a film for three months
 talavaarein lekar log studio main aa gaye, ab kisi din bandooken lekar aaenge
 Even after the defeat of Maharana, people were accepted as great conquerors 
 unki veerta kii gaatha par us haar kaa koi asar hi nahin tha, jise ek shiksha mantri ne apni takat se badalane kii koshish kii
 There is a big defeat in books for the unbeatable Maharana in folk legends
 mujhe nahin lagata ki maharana pratap jaise bahadur kaagaz par haar kii jagah jeet likh dene se khush hote
 The one who is brave also embraces defeat
 par yah sahi he ki public main itihaas ko lekar waisi samaj nahin he jaisi class room main he
 There is heavy disharmony in the class room as well
 itihaas ke lakhon chaatro ko acchhee kitaaben nahin milin, shikshak nahin mili isliye sabane kitaab kii jagah kooda uthaa liya
 Litter understood history
 ham aaj bhi itihaas ko gaurav gaan or gaurav bhav ke bina nahin samaj pate hai
 The gold bird was our country
 vishwa guru tha desh
 These are all adjectives, not history
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 However, the number of historians born in India in this three months, Oxford and Cambridge could not have been born in their history of several hundred years
 bharat main aap bas jalaakar, poster fadkar itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 You can become a historian by stopping the performance of a film
 teen saal main hamane jinte itihaaskaar paidaa kiye hai, unke liye ab hamaare paas utani universti bhi nahin hai
 It was the imagination of the British to convert the history of India to Hindu history into Muslim history
 aaj bahut se log angrezi hukumat kii soch ko puraa kar rahe hai
 They are taking history back into the mold of Hindu versus Muslim
 vartmaan par pardaa daalane ke liye itihaas se vaise mudde laae ja rahe hai jinke zarie naagarik kaa, matadaata kaa dharmik pahchaan banaai ja sake
 Why do we ever seek our Indianness in unity in diversity, in religious uniformity? Why don't we get our identity from the Constitution, for which we fought for a hundred years
 din raat bahes kiye, lakhon log jail gaye
 If many feel that this question should be debated, are we rightly placing our questions, arguing, will these forums be the anchors not reading the newspaper
 akhir kyon bahusankhyak dharm itihaas ke kirdaaron par dharmik vyakhya thopanaa chahta he? kabhi media ke spes main hamaari bhartiyata mili sur meraa tumhaara se banati thi, aaj hamaara sur hamaara, tumhaara sur tumhaara yaa tumhaara sur kuch nahin, hamaara hi sur tumhaara
 We Indians are going through both a crisis and a sense of being an Indian
 hamen ek khandit naagarikta ke bodh ke saath taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 Within which such political programming is being done through fake news and fake history that people can be triggered in small groups in any city
 kya aap itihaas kaa badla le sakate hai to phir aap nyaay kii mul avadharana ke khilaaf ja rahe hai jo kahata he ki khun kaa badla khun nahin hota he
 If we go to the concept of blood revenge, then violence will be violence all around us
 is samay bharat main do tarah ke polytical aaidentity hai
 One who is armed with religious aggression and the other has lost religious confidence
 ek daraane vaala he or daraa hua he
 This imbalance is going to bring many challenges in front of us which we recognize very well
 hamane iske nattejey dekhe hai, bhugte bhi hai
 Different communities pay at different times
 hamaari smritiyon se puraane zakhm mitate bhi nahin ki ham nae zakhm le aate hai
 Like India is a two in one country
 jise hamaari sarkari jubaan main india or bharat ke rup main pahchaan mil chuki he
 In the same way, our identity is based on two in one religion and caste
 aap in jati sanghathanon kii taraf se bharat ko dekhie, aap uskaa cheharaa sabake saamne dekh nahin paaenge
 You see the face of the caste secretly at home
 hamane jati ko khatm nahin kiya
 We have created new new CAST COLONIES in free India
 ye CAST COLONIES CONCRETE kii hai
 Its head is a people born in that modern India
 puuchhie khud se ki aaj kyon samaaj main ye jati coloni ban rahi hai
 Today does not mean 2018 nor 2014
 ham bharat kaa gaurav karte hai, dharm kaa gaurav karte hai, jati kaa gaurav karte hai
 We want to save all the cruelty within us
 kya jati vaaki gaurav karne kii chiz he? is sawaal kaa jawaab agar haa he to ham samvidhan ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai, apane rashtriya andolan kii bhaavana ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai

 in ankaron ke paas sarkaar ke liye koi sawaal nahin he, sirf ek hi queshchan sabake paas he
 The name of this question is Hindu Muslim Question, HMQ
 bharat ke news ankar rashtrawaad kii aad main sampradayik ho chuke hai
 To the extent that when the youth in Udaipur climb the roof of the court carrying the saffron flag, the anchors are silent
 kya ham aisa bharat chaahate the, chaahate hai? adaalat jis samvidhan ke tahat he, usee samvidhan kii ek dhara se media apni azaadi kaa charnamrita grahan karata he
 Charanamrit must have understood
 garvanment of media ke paas ek hi agenda he
 Hindu Muslim Question
 isse jude phek news kii itani bharmaar he ki aap alt news dot in par pard sakate hai
 Now fake news has started being made from the other side
 My dear friends, believe me, Media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 yah samaaj main aisa asantulan paidaa kar rahaa he, apni bahason ke zarie aisa zehar bo rahaa he jisase hamaare loktantr ke bheetar bhay kaa maahaul bana rahe
 Which triggers a rush anytime anywhere and overpowers you
 aap kahenge ki kya itnaa bura he, kuch bhi acha nahin he
 i know you like positive poses from time to time
 ek positive bataata hum
 India's democracy is not bent by the media's bowing down
 vah media ke mit jane se nahin mit jayega
 He neither bowed in emergency nor he would bow during the era of dock media
 bharat kaa loktantr hamaari aatma he
 We have a conscience
 aatma amar he
 You can read the Gita
 main garvanment of media kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Like you, i also dream about India
 magar jaagate hue
 The reality in front of me is a dream
 main ek aise bharat kaa sapana dekhtaa hum jo hakeekat kaa saamana kar sake
 Think about why we are entangled in questions of the past these days
 agar in sawaalon kaa saamana hi karnaa he to kya ham thik se kar rahe hai, kya in sawaalon kaa saamana karne kii jagah tivi kaa studio he? yaa classroom he, conference room hai, or saamana ham kis tarah se karenge, kya ham aaj hisaab karenge, kya ham aaj qatleam karenge? to kya aap apane ghar se ek hatyara dene ke liye taiyaar hai? nafrat kii yah aandhi har ghar main ek hatyara paidaa kar jaaegi, wo aapkaa bhai ho saktaa he, betaa ho saktaa he, dost ho saktaa he, padosi ho saktaa he, kya aapane man bana liya he? kya hamane siikhaa he ki itihaas kaa saamana kaise kiya jaae? ham class room main nahin, sadak or tivi studio main itihaas kaa hisaab karne nikle hai
 You do not change history by making Nehru a Muslim or by defeating Akbar, when history starts to change by the order of the Minister of Education, then understand that he would not have been a good student of the Chemistry
 kya aap yahaan harvard main baithkar is baat ko sweekaar kar sakate hai ki itihaas ke class room main koi mantri aakar itihaas badal de
 Take the book from the professor's hand and give it to read
 kya aap bardaasht karenge? jab aap khud ke liye yah bardaasht nahin kar sakate to bharat ke liye kaise kar sakate hai? There must be a new debate in history, there should be new research
 lekin ham vaisaa kar rahe hai
 We have debated for three months on a film
 itani bahes hamane bharat kii garibi par nahin kii, bharat kii sambhaavnaaon par nahin kii, hamane teen maheene ek film par bahes kii
 People came to the studio with swords, now someday will bring guns
 maharana kii haar ke baad bhi logon ne mahaan vijeta ke rup main sweekaar kiya tha
 His heroic saga had no effect on the defeat which an Education Minister tried to replace with his strength
 lok shrutiyon main aparaajey maharana ke liye kitabon main badi haar he
 i do not think that brave soldiers like Maharana Pratap would have been happy to write victory instead of defeat
 jo vir hota he wo haar ko bhi gale lagaataa he
 But it is true that the public does not understand the history as it is in the class room
 class room main bhi baari asamnata he
 Millions of students of history did not get good books, teachers could not find them, so they took the garbage in place of books
 kooday ko itihaas samaj liya
 Even today, we do not understand history without pride and pride
 sone kii chidiya tha hamaara desh
 The country was the world master
 ye sab visheshan hai, itihaas nahin he
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 vaise is teen maheene main bharat me jitne itihaaskaar paidaa hue hai, utane oxford or cambridge apane kai sau saal ke itihaas main paidaa nahin kar paae honge
 In India, you can become a historian just by burning, tearing posters
 kisi film kaa pradarshan rukvaa kar aap itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 For the historians we have produced in three years, now we do not even have that much diversity
 angrezon kii kalpana thi ki bharat ke itihaas ko hindu itihaas muslim itihaas main badal do
 Today many people are fulfilling the idea of english rule
 wo waapas itihaas ko hindu banaam musalmaan ke khaanche main le ja rahe hai
 To cover the present, issues are being brought from history through which the religious identity of the citizen and voter can be created
 ham kyon apni bhartiyata kabhi anekta main ekta main khojate khojate, dharmik ekarupata main khojane lagate hai? ham samvidhan se apni pahchaan kyon nahin hasil karte, jiske liye hamane sau saal kii ladaai ladi
 Argued day and night, millions of people went to jail
 agar bahuton ko lagata he ki is sawaal par bahes honi chahie to kya ham sahi tareeke se apane sawaal rakh rahe hai, bahes kar rahe hai, kya uskaa manch akhbaar tak na padhane vaale ye ankar honge
 After all, why does the majority religion want to impose religious interpretation on the characters of history? Once our Indianness was found in the media space, my voice was made with yours, today our tone is ours, your note is yours or your tone is nothing, our voice is yours
 ham bharatiyon kaa bhartiya hone kaa bodh or itihaas bodh donon sankat se guzar rahaa he
 We are being prepared with a sense of a fragmented citizenship
 jiske bheetar phek news or phek history ke zarie aisi politicil programing kii ja rahi he ki kisi bhi shahar main chote chote samooh main logon ko trigar kiya ja saktaa he
 Can you avenge history, then you are going against the basic concept of justice which says that blood is not revenge blood
 agar ham khun kaa badla khun kii avadharana par jaaenge to hamaare chaaron taraf hinsa hi hinsa hogi
 There are two types of political identity in India at this time
 ek jo dharmik aakraamakata se las he or doosraa to dharmik aatmavishvaas kho chukaa he
 One is intimidating and frightened
 yah asantulan aane vaale samay main hamaare saamne kai chunautiyaan laane vaala hai jinhen ham koob pahachaanate hai
 We have seen its consequences, we also pay
 alag-alag samay par alag-alag samudaayon ne bhugte hai
 Old wounds are not erased from our memories that we bring new wounds
 jaise hindustan ek tu in van desh he
 Which has been recognized as India and India in our official tongue
 usee tarah hamaari pahchaan dharm or jati ke tu in van par aadhaarit he
 You look at India from these caste organizations, you will not be able to see its face in front of everyone
 aap jati kaa cheharaa chupake se ghar jaakar dekhte hai
 We did not end caste
 hamane azaad bharat main nai nai CAST COLONIES banaai hai
 These belong to CAST COLONIES CONCRETE
 iske mukhiya us aadhunik bharat main paidaa hue log hai
 Ask yourself why these castes are becoming colonies in society today
 aaj kaa matlab 2018 nahin or na hi 2014 he
 We pride India, pride of religion, pride of caste
 ham apane bheetar har tarah kii krurta ko bachaate rahanaa chaahate hai
 Is caste really a matter of pride? If the answer to this question is yes, then we are cheating with the Constitution, betraying the spirit of our national movement
 team india kaa raajnneetik slogan cast india, religen india main badal chukaa he
 a cooperative society of Brahmins has been formed in Andhra Pradesh
 iskaa mishan he brahmanon kii viraasat ko dobaaraa se jivit karnaa or use aage badhanaa
 What is the heritage of Brahmins, what is the heritage of Rajputs? Then what is the problem with Bhima Koregaon, the legacy of Dalits? Then what is the problem with the legacy of the Mughals, where the Israeli head of state also wants to spend two moments with his wife
 aap is sosayadi kii website http: / / www
 apbrahmincoop
 com par jaaiye
 Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu is launching its magazine because the head of this society is a member of his party
 is sosayadi ke lakshya vahiin hai jo ek sarkaar ke hone chahie
 Which should be our economic policies
 kya hamaari nitiyaan is kadar fail rahi hai ki ab ham apni apni jatiyon kaa koparative banane lage hai
 Its goal is to form a self-help group of poor Brahmin castes, give them loans to do business, buy cars
 iske sadsy sirf brahman samudaay se ho sakate hai
 There are IAS, professional people
 iske cheiman anand surya bhi brahman hai
 In his introduction, he calls himself a trade union leader and businessman
 duniya main bijanes main shaayad hi trade union netaa banate hai
 He has lived in BJP, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Janata Dal, Samajwadi Janata Party, Janata Dal Secular
 jahaan unhone siikhaa he ki brahn samudaay ko naitik or raajnneetik samarthan kaise dena he
 We did not know that people in Samajwadi Party also learn all this
 2003 se ve tidipi main hai
 It is not the only such institution
 videshon main bhi or bharat main bhi aise anek jatigat sanghathan kaayam hai
 The political status of their presidents is more than any leader
 is spes ke baahar bina is tarah kii pahchaan ke liye netaa bananaa asambhav he
 In 2013, Vedic Society for Brahmins was started in Bangalore
 sochie ek township he sirf brahmanon kaa
 Where will this exclusion take us, is it not a kind of ghetto? 2700 ghar brahamanon ke alag se honge
 This will become a system of villages again
 brahmanon kaa alag se
 Isn't it ghetto? azaad bharat main yah kyon hua? assi ke dashak main jab houseing sosayadi kaa vistaar hua to use jati or khaas peshey ke aadhaar par basaaya gaya
 There is Patparganj in Delhi, there you will find many housing societies according to caste, occupation, region and state
 to phir ham samvidhan ke aadhaar par bhartiya kaise ban rahe the
 Can we not be an Indian without caste support? jaipur ke vidyanagar main jatiyon ke alag alag hostel bane hai
 Shri Rajput Sabha has built hostels for boys of its caste
 ladakiyon ke bhi hai
 The Yadavas also have separate hostels
 meena jati ke bhi alag chatravaas hai
 Brahmin caste also has separate hostels
 ab aap bataayen, in hostel se nikal jo bhi aage jayega wo apane bheetar kiski pahchaan ko aage rakhega
 Will his identity not clash with Constitution-based Indianness? There is also the Khatik studentship which the government has made
 kyon rajya sarkaron ko daliton ke liye alag se hostel banane kii zarurat padi? kya hamaari jatiyon ke oonche tabake ne samvidhan ke aadhaar par bharat ko abhi tak sweekaar nahin kiya he, kya vah samvidhan aadhaarit naagarikta ko pasand nahin karata he? kya jatiyon ko koi aisa samooh he jo dharm ke sahare apana varchasv phir se hasil karnaa chahta he? kya koi aisa bhi samooh he jo ab pehle se kai guna zyaada takat se is varchasv ko chunauti de rahaa he?tippaniyan Like India's politics, the media also comes from these cast colonies
 uske sampadak bhi isi cast colony se aate hai
 They do not like the identity of caste in public but they like the identity of religion
 isliye ve dharm kii pahchaan ke zarie jati kii pahchaan thel rahe hai
 This work can only be done by those who do not believe in democracy because caste is against democracy
 garvanment of media main sab kuch thik nahin he
 The positive is that it is speaking freely against democracy
 bhaichaare ke kilaaf puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Our Government of Media is free
 pehle se kahin azaad he
 i am ending my speech on this positive note
 kul milakar ham yathasthiti ko pramot kar rahe hai
 We are calling the pride of religion a nation
 aap chahen to darwin ko riject kar sakate hai
 If you want, you can declare Ganesh Pooja as a medical college
 My dear friends, believe me, Media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 yah samaaj main aisa asantulan paidaa kar rahaa he, apni bahason ke zarie aisa zehar bo rahaa he jisase hamaare loktantr ke bheetar bhay kaa maahaul bana rahe
 Which triggers a rush anytime anywhere and overpowers you
 aap kahenge ki kya itnaa bura he, kuch bhi acha nahin he
 i know you like positive poses from time to time
 ek positive bataata hum
 India's democracy is not bent by the media's bowing down
 vah media ke mit jane se nahin mit jayega
 He neither bowed in emergency nor he would bow during the era of dock media
 bharat kaa loktantr hamaari aatma he
 We have a conscience
 aatma amar he
 You can read the Gita
 main garvanment of media kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Like you, i also dream about India
 magar jaagate hue
 The reality in front of me is a dream
 main ek aise bharat kaa sapana dekhtaa hum jo hakeekat kaa saamana kar sake
 Think about why we are entangled in questions of the past these days
 agar in sawaalon kaa saamana hi karnaa he to kya ham thik se kar rahe hai, kya in sawaalon kaa saamana karne kii jagah tivi kaa studio he? yaa classroom he, conference room hai, or saamana ham kis tarah se karenge, kya ham aaj hisaab karenge, kya ham aaj qatleam karenge? to kya aap apane ghar se ek hatyara dene ke liye taiyaar hai? nafrat kii yah aandhi har ghar main ek hatyara paidaa kar jaaegi, wo aapkaa bhai ho saktaa he, betaa ho saktaa he, dost ho saktaa he, padosi ho saktaa he, kya aapane man bana liya he? kya hamane siikhaa he ki itihaas kaa saamana kaise kiya jaae? ham class room main nahin, sadak or tivi studio main itihaas kaa hisaab karne nikle hai
 You do not change history by making Nehru a Muslim or by defeating Akbar, when history starts to change by the order of the Minister of Education, then understand that he would not have been a good student of the Chemistry
 kya aap yahaan harvard main baithkar is baat ko sweekaar kar sakate hai ki itihaas ke class room main koi mantri aakar itihaas badal de
 Take the book from the professor's hand and give it to read
 kya aap bardaasht karenge? jab aap khud ke liye yah bardaasht nahin kar sakate to bharat ke liye kaise kar sakate hai? There must be a new debate in history, there should be new research
 lekin ham vaisaa kar rahe hai
 We have debated for three months on a film
 itani bahes hamane bharat kii garibi par nahin kii, bharat kii sambhaavnaaon par nahin kii, hamane teen maheene ek film par bahes kii
 People came to the studio with swords, now someday will bring guns
 maharana kii haar ke baad bhi logon ne mahaan vijeta ke rup main sweekaar kiya tha
 His heroic saga had no effect on the defeat which an Education Minister tried to replace with his strength
 lok shrutiyon main aparaajey maharana ke liye kitabon main badi haar he
 i do not think that brave soldiers like Maharana Pratap would have been happy to write victory instead of defeat
 jo vir hota he wo haar ko bhi gale lagaataa he
 But it is true that the public does not understand the history as it is in the class room
 class room main bhi baari asamnata he
 Millions of students of history did not get good books, teachers could not find them, so they took the garbage in place of books
 kooday ko itihaas samaj liya
 Even today, we do not understand history without pride and pride
