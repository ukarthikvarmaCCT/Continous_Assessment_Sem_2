 madhya pradesh ke ek mantri kailash vijayawargeey kii hansi dekhen to unki sari safaaiyon ke baavjood yah samaj main aata he ki patrkaar akshay singh kii maut bhi unhen vichlit nahin kar pai
 But it is not a man but that system, the ideology that makes such a man
 jo vichlit hote hai ve halke se dukh se bhi vichlit ho jate hai
 Those who are not, do not even have two thousand deaths
 isliye ek tarah se yah kailash vijayawargeey yaa unke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan se hamaari apeksha kii hi gadabadi he
 Why should we expect that those who are not distracted by a huge scandal in their state, who have a very strong suspicion of promoting people associated with such scams, who are being killed by the accused, are distracted by the death of a journalist Will be sach to yah he ki shaayad uski maut se patrakarita kaa sansar bhi vichlit nahin he
 It is a wonder of everyone's thick skin in our time that no pain pricks such that we forget everything
 sab kuch jaise ek kaarobaar se sanchalit he
 Everything has come out of the understanding that this is a profession in which news, like everything else, is part of a business
 tippaniyan But the world of news is a world of dangers, this is understood when an innocent or obsessive journalist breaks out of mutual agreement of mutual interest to find something in which the cradle of the system can be seen moving
 aise kisi mode par zyaadaatar vah akelaa hota he, nirih hota he or kabhi-kabhi kisi sandigdh maut kaa shikaar bhi ho jaataa he
 Then some people praise him, some people keep distance from him and some people become silently careful not to go through the street from where he has passed
 lekin koi jaadu hota he, koi karishma hota he, kuch or nadaan log nikal aate hai jo is puri samajhadaari ke bheetar kii vah daraar khoj lete hai jahaan se khabaron ko dabaanaa naammumkin hota he
 These inexplicable voices of democracy are our real strength - despite all the downfall, that pride of journalism, which the laughing people are afraid of, wants to kill it, but in the end, they tighten the noose on their own neck

 ye hamaare samay main sabaki moti hoti chamadi kaa kamaal he ki koi bhi dard aisa nahin chubhta ki ham sab kuch bhul jaaen
 Like everything is driven by a business
 sabakuch is samaj se niklaa he ki yah ek pesha he jisamen baaki chizon kii tarah khabar bhi ek dhandhe kaa hissaa he
 The comments lekin khabaron kii duniya khataron kii duniya he, yah baat tab samaj main aati he, jab koi nadaan yaa jununee patrkaar aapasi hiton ke ankahe samjhaute ko todakar kuch aisa khojane nikalataa he jisamen vyavastha kii chulein hilti dikhen
 At such a turn, he is usually alone, innocent and sometimes even a victim of a suspicious death
 phir kuch log uskaa gungan karte hai, kuch log usase duuri baratate hai or kuch log chupchaap saavdhaan ho jate hai- ki us gali se nahin guzaranaa he, jahaan se wo guzara he
 But there is some magic, there is some charisma, some more foolish people come out who find the rift within this complete understanding where it is impossible to suppress the news
 loktantr kii ye na dikhne vaali awaazen hamaari asli takat hai- saare patan ke baavjood patrakarita kaa vah gaurav, jisase hansane vaale darate hai, use maarna chaahate hai lekin antat: apni hi gardan par kas rahe fande ko kuch or majboot kar daalate hai
 But the world of news is a world of dangers, this is understood when an innocent or obsessive journalist breaks out of mutual agreement of mutual interest to find something in which the cradle of the system can be seen moving

 pramod kumaar ne sanjay kumaar kii pitayee ke aarope main kuch yuvaaon ke khilaaf pulisia karrwai ko galat bataate hue jila prashasan ko hi kathghare main khadaa kar diya
 The Tourism Minister said that the administration does not take any action against Sanjay Kumar, who has made objectionable remarks in the name of expression against a person like Atal Bihari Vajpayee, but if some young assistant angry with that post argues with the professor then the police will treat him like criminals He treats pramod kumaar ne pulisia karrwai kaa khulkar virodh kiya

 dubai main yojit 'ajtak' ke sho 'salaam cricket' ke paanchaven seshan 'india-india' main bharat ke diggaj of spinner ravichandran aswin ne hissaa liya
 Let me tell you that today (monday) is also Ashwin's birthday
 seshan ko varisht khel patrkaar boria majumdaar ne sanchalit kiya
 Ashwin's birthday was celebrated on the stage of Salaam Cricket
 boria majumdaar ne aswin se poocha- kya southampton main aap par zyada pressure tha, kyonki vahaan of stump ke paas kaaphi raf tha, jisase of spinner ke liye kaaphi madad thi or aapako uskaa phayda nahin mila
 Ashwin said- Of course i tried to do my best in that Test match, but could not get the expected results
 boria majumdaar ne aswin se poocha- kya southampton main aap 100% feet the, is par aswin ne kaha- cricket main 100% feet hone yaa nahin hone kii baat nahin hoti
 When you take off on the field, you try to perform your best
 younus khan- bharat-pakistan bada muqabla, iske chalate ganguli kii captaini gaiaswin ne kaha ki mujhe niraashaa he ki ham southampton main siries ko 2-2 par nahin laa sake
 In the Test match, there was a lot to do outside the off stump for the right-handed batsmen, but we could not do it
 main hameshaa yah mahasoos karata tha ki maine pad yaa bat-pad ke jariye khilne kii koshish karata, to shaayad sahi rahata, lekin nijee taur par main maanata hum ki ham aisa nahin kar sake or yah behad niraashajanakar rahaa
 Ashwin when asked if you think India will do well in Australia
 aswin ne kaha- sabhi tiimon kii tulana karnaa jyaadati hogi
 Every team goes on a tour with the aim of doing their best
 mahaan bhartiya timen kii baat karte hue aswin ne kaha- bharat ne 2007 main england main siries jiti or 2008 main perth main ham pehali baar jite to har team kii apni pahchaan thi
 On the statement made by Ravi Shastri, Ashwin said- If this comes from the dressing room, then their aim is to maintain the confidence of the team
 aswin ne kaha- dressing room main har khilaadi jab khilne jaataa he to vah apana acha pradarshan karne jaataa he
 Every day a different player is a match winner and tries to win the match to his team
 aswin ne kaha ki jab ham england main siries kii shuruyaat karne ja rahe the tab hamen vishwaas tha ki hamaare paas jeetne ke achche chance hai
 Most people believe that the scoreboard does not show that we showed the game
 bataur cricketer main yah kahana chaahunga ki hamane kuch acchhee cricket kheli he, lekin hamaare paas jeet kaa shandaar mauka tha jiskaa phayda ham donon haath se nahin uthaa sake
 There is a difference between the guest team and the host team, the home team has to show good game in every department of the game

 hardik pandya par baatcheet karte hue yah aswin ne kaha- hardik rud nahin hai or kaaphi vinamr hai
 Hardik is a good child
 aswin ne kaha- pakistan ke khilaaf match se pehle dabaav hota he, kyonki isse logon kii bhavanaaen kaaphi judi hoti hai
 Ashwin said - now the time has changed and to reduce the pressure against Pakistan, it is given a game name only
 2017 main champions trophy final ke baad pakistan ke saath mukaable ko lekar aar aswin ne kaha ki main maanata hum ki duniya kii anya tiimon kii tulana main ham kaaphi majboot team hai
 i do not believe that a loss in the Champions Trophy final will put pressure on any player
 agar kisi khilaadi ko isaki takalif he to asia cap uske liye behtareen mauka hoga

 Hoshangabad SP Ashutosh Pratap Singh has issued orders in this regard
 iske liye parijan kaa sample lene kii karrvaai shuru kar di gai he
 At the same time, the tractor-trolley, sticks and stones used in this massacre have also been seized
 sari chijen is cese ke aaropee pradeep sharma ke gaanv dudadeh sthit makaan se baraamad kii gai hai
 Police investigation is going on
 jaankaree ke mutabik, dilli se laapata leena kaa shav madhya pradesh ke hoshangabad ke satapura ke jangal se baraamad hua tha
 She went from Delhi to Bhopal on April 28 to demarcate her ancestral land
 ek din apni saheli ke paas rahane ke baad vah apane ghar ke liye ravaanaa hui, lekin unka mobile swich of ho gaya tha
 After this the massacre was revealed
 leena dilli ke bansatkunj ilaake main rahati thi
 She was a resident of Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh
 hoshangabad kii leena murder mistry ne haal main ai krime thriller drishyam kii yaad taaja kar di he
 Just like the visual film, the slayer here threw her mobile phone into a passenger train after killing Lina to confuse the police
 taaki phone kaa lokation police ko chakra de
 But by coincidence, this mobile policeman got a boy from a boy, about 30 km from mouka-e-vardat
 katl kii kadiyaan judati chali gayi
 Perhaps this is also the difference between reel and real life
 38 saal kii leena ke naam uske gaanv hoshangabad ke dudadeh main karodon kii pushtaini jameen thi
 But Leena's maternal uncle Pradeen Sharma kept an eye on it
 isi baat par mamaa-bhanji ke bich ladaai bhi chali aa rahi thi
 Before the murder, Leena herself went from Delhi first to Bhopal and then from Bhopal on 29 April to demarcate her land in the ancestral village Dudadeh, but this day proved to be the last day of her life
 vah abhi simakan karwaane pahunchi hi thi ki mamaa phir se aade aa gaye
 At first, a heated argument ensued between the two and then Pradeep Sharma, along with his two servants Gorelal and Rajendra Kumare, stabbed Lina to death by strangling and strangling her
 lekin katl kii ye vaardaat jitne thande dimag se anjaam di gai, iske baad police ko uljhane kii sajeesh utane hi shaatiranaa tareeke se kii gai thi
 The police themselves were surprised by reaching out to the conspiracy they hatched to keep Lina's disappearance a secret forever
 kaatilon ne ek parfect murder plan tha
 Friends posted on Facebook, Lina of Muhammedalli was missing in Hoshangabad, 861 km from here
 uskaa mobile phone bhi rahasyamayi tareeke se switchd of ho chukaa tha
 But neither his sister Hema Mishra, who lives in Hoshangabad, was worried about him nor his uncle Pradeep Sharma
 donon main se koi bhi apni taraf se chal kar uski gumshudagi kii shikaayat karne police ke paas nahin pahunchaa
 But when Leena's friends sitting in Bhopal started a campaign on Facebook in an attempt to find her, the family came into action
 mamaa par tiki police ke shaq kii suilina ke gaayab hone ke 6 din baad uske mamaa pradeep sharma ne hoshangabad ke sohagpur thane main leena ke gaayab hone kii report likhavai
 But when the police started questioning Pradeep Sharma about Lina, the maternal uncle said many things that caused the needle of suspicion of the police
 leena ke itane dinon tak gaayab rahane ke baavjood ab tak khamosh rahane kaa koi saaf-saaf jawaab uske paas nahin tha
 Pradeep Sharma told that Leena had reached her village in a car for the last time
 autowala ne kholaa mamaa kaa raajpulice chaanbin ke dauraan ek aisa autowala mila, jisane bataaya ki wo khud leena ko apane auto main gaanv tak chhod aayaa tha
 In such a situation, the question was why Lina's maternal uncle lied about her coming to the village? From above, Leena's friends from Delhi and Bhopal were constantly calling the police and suspected her uncle and sister of missing Leena
 pradeep sharma kii tarah hi uske do naukar gorelaal or rajendra kumre ke javaabon main bhi contradiction yani virodhabhas tha
 The suspicion of the police increased with confidence
 aise saamne ai katl kii sajishpulice ne donon naukaron ko hiraasat main lekar kaayade se poochtacha kii, to katl kii sajeesh saamne aane main zyaada der nahin lagi
 Soon Mama Pradeep Sharma had also reached behind bars
 lekin iske baad unhone jo kahani sunai, use sun kar pulisavaalon kaa bhi dimag gum gaya
 After killing Lina with her servants, Mama had set the corpse in a thick forest
 police ko uljhane ke liye uskaa mobile phone bhi jangal ke paas se guzarate ek paisanger tren main phenk diya tha

 The producer must stop this nonsense
 - Phutarmal Jain (@pppjain) February 9, 2019I want to ask the makers of # kulfikumarbajewalathat how is it ok to show that mature adults are constantly traumatising a child? The content of the serial is extremely disturbing

 Maharashtra's impact on Bihar's politics may impact on the friendship between the BJP-JDU and Bihar's assembly elections next year
 maharashtra kii raajnneeti kaa asar bihar par bhi dikh saktaa he kyonki maharashtra main jis prakaar 30 saal purana bijepi or shivasena kaa gathbandhan mukhyamantri pad ko lekar tut gaya, aise main bihar main bijepi or jediu ke gathbandhan par bhi iskaa asar pad saktaa he
 Because the political developments in Maharashtra have broken many illusions
 pehla ye ki post yaa pre ellins kaa ab koi matlab nahi rah gaya he
 The other parties are no longer delaying their ideology and ideology in fulfilling their political interests
 bihar main endie kaa cheharaa nitishahalaki bihar kii sthiti thodi alag he
 Here BJP has already declared Nitish Kumar as the face of NDA so there should not be any dispute regarding the post of Chief Minister
 lekin siton ke bantwaare ko lekar maamla funs saktaa he
 The two parties contested the last assembly elections in 2010 together
 us samay jediu 142 siton par or bijepi ne 101 siton par chunaav ladaa
 Subsequently in 2013, JDU split from BJP and contested 2014 Lok Sabha and 2015 Assembly elections
 2017 se donon partiyaan phir se ek saath hai or sabakuch pehle jaisaa chal rahaa he
 Prior to 2013, jdu's role was that of elder brother in Bihar but after the JDU got a big push in the 2014 Lok Sabha, the 2019 Lok Sabha elections were fought by both parties on par
 isliye mana ja rahaa he ki vidhansabha chunaav main bhi barabari kaa fermula hi lagu ho saktaa he
 JDU contested 101 seats, RJD 101 and Congress 41 seats in the 2015 assembly elections in 243 seats of the Penchbihar Assembly
 mana ja rahaa he ki bihar main is baar bhi jediu bijepi or algepi ke bich seat bantwaare kaa formula yahi hoga
 Since the BJP had given five seats of its share to the JDU in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP has an argument to contest on equal footing
 ab sabakuch is baat par nirbhar karata he ki jediu is par kitna amal karti he
 But if JDU decides to contest on equal seats then it will be a danger bell for him and Nitish Kumar
 jediu har haal main bijepi se zyada siton par chunaav ladane kii koshish karegi taaki uske zyada vidhayak hon
 Despite all the arguments and changed circumstances, JDU would like to contest at least 142, if not 120 seats
 ahm hoga strike redgar donon dal baraabar siton par bhi chunaav ladate hai or donon dalon ke paas bahumat laayak aankada aata he to asli khel chunaav ke baad bhi ho saktaa he
 Here everything can depend on the strike rate, the party which has a higher strike rate, who has more seats, can claim to form the government
 agar jediu ke zyada vidhayak jitate hai to nitish kumaar nirvivaad rup se bihar agle mukhyamantri honge agar bijepi kaa stike rate zyada hua jaisaa ki 2010 ke vidhansabha or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main dekhne ko mila tab maamla kuch badal saktaa he
 The role of LJP will be crucial in this situation
 kendra kii raajnneeti ke tahat jaahir he ki algepi kaa jhukaav bijepi kii taraf zyada hoga
 In such a situation, BJP can also play its cards
 gathbandhan dharm kii vishwasaneeyata par prashnchinhis tarah se dekha jaye to mahaeashtra kii raajnneeti ne gathbandhan dharm kii vishwasaneeyata par prashnchinh jarur laga diya he
 Despite being in a coalition, political parties are not trusting each other
 satta paane ke lobh main siddhant or vichaardhaaraon ko tilanjali dene main der nahin kar rahi he
 Do you know that after the election, there will be a situation that BJP and RJD form a government like Congress and NCP are forming government in Maharashtra along with Shiv Sena
 yaa phir jediu phir argedy or congress ke saath milakar sarkaar bana le

 An American journalist of Pakistani descent has been selected to conduct a debate in the United States for the presidential candidacy
 is kaam ke liye chuni jane vaali dakshin asia mul kii vah pehali america patrkaar hai
 This information came from a media report on Saturday
 don news kii ek report ke anusaar, pibies news ower kii amana navaj 19 disambar ko los angelis sthit loyola merimount main yojit hone vaale chathe democratic primary dibet kaa sah-sanchaalan karengi
 While everyone is shocked by the truth coming in front of Arshan Khan's Rashmi Desai, there is a big news about Himanshi Khurana in the meantime
 darasal, big bos khabari ke mutabik is hafte mashhoor contestant himanshi khurana ghar se beghar ho jaaengi
 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has announced a new date for filing the reply in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case
 netherland ke hegg sthit antarrashtriya nyaayalay kii ore se jari bayaan main kaha gaya ki jadhav maamle main bharat ko 17 april 2018 ko apana likhit jawaab daakhil karnaa hoga, jabaki pakistan ko 17 july 2018 tak apana jawaab daakhil karnaa hoga
 The International Court of Justice has taken this decision after knowing the sides of India and Pakistan in the Jadhav case and looking at the status of the case
 isse pehle 18 may 2017 ko antarrashtriya nyaayalay kii 10 sadasyeey peeth ne is maamle main nirnay lene tak pakistan ko jadhav kii sajaa ko taamil karne se roak diya tha
 It was considered a shock for Pakistan
 sanyukt raashtra ke pradhan nyaayik nikaay ne pichley hafte bayaan jari kar jadhav maamle main bharat ko jawaab or phir uskaa jawaab dene ke liye pakistan ko adhikrut kiya
 The statement said that the court has given India a date of 17 April 2018 and Pakistan 17 July 2018 for these written arguments
 bayaan ke mutabik antarrashtriya nyaayalay ne donon pakshon ke drushtikonon or maamle kii paristhitayon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yah faisla kiya he
 Earlier in September 2017, India had told the ICJ through a memorial (written petition) that the Vienna Convention on Embassy of Pakistan was violating the 1963 rules in the Jadhav case
 is patr main bharat ne pakistan ke rukh kaa pardaafash kiya tha,
 In this, Pakistan's lie related to Kulbhushan's arrest was placed before the International Court of Justice
 maaloom ho ki pakistan nebhartiya nausena ke purv adhikari kulbhushan jadhavako kathith jasusi karne ke aarope main faansee kii sajaa sunai thi
 However, India says that Pakistan had abducted Kulbhushan Jadhav from Iran
 un par jasusi karne kaa aarope bhi managasaint he
 He has retired from the Indian Navy and did his business in Iran
 kiskaa he tajmahal? aaj loksabhaa main yah sawaal uthaaya gaya or satta paksh ke sadasyon ne kaha, hamaara he taj’ jabaki vipaksh kii ore baithe kuch sadasyon ne kaha, sabakaa he taj? samskruti mantri mahesh sharma jab sangrahalayon ke sambandh main puche gaye sawaalon ke jawaab de rahe the to eimm ke asaduddin ovaisi ne sawaal kiya, kiskaa he taj? samaajawaadee party ke dharmendra yadav sangrahalayon ke sambandh main anupoorak sawaal kar rahe the tabhi unki bagal vaali seat par baithe ovaisi ne phir kaha, kiskaa he taj? mantri ne haalanki is sawaal ko koi tawvajo nahin di or unhone sadasyon ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dena jari rakhaa
 Significantly, Uttar Pradesh's Urban Development and Minority Affairs Minister Azam Khan recently said that the Taj Mahal should be declared the property of the State Waqf Board
 ajam ne 13 november ko lakhanu main vakf board ke sadasyon kii maujuudagi main muslim netaaon kii ek baithak ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki taj mahal ko vakf kii sampatti ghoshit kiya jaae or ise vakf ko saunp diya jaae
 While fears are being raised about the safety of nuclear installations in earthquake-hit Japan, former chairman of India's Atomic Energy Commission Anil Kakodkar said on Monday that Indian nuclear plants are safe
 baharhaal, kakodakar ne kaha ki japan main chaaye maujuuda sankat ke baad duniya bhar main sanyantron ke praaroop main sudhaar aayega
 In a lecture on the importance of nuclear power at the VS Paige Parliamentary Training Center in Vidhan Bhavan, Mumbai, he said that Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant was safe, but the explosion occurred because the cooling system did not work after the tsunami flooded
 Was getting it done
 kakodakar ne kaha ki haalanki, sthiti ab bhi samvedansheel he or purna akalan kuch samay baad hi uplabdh ho sakegaa
 He said that India's nuclear plants are safe
 parmaanu urja ayog ke purv adhyaksh ne kaha, japan or bharat main hone vaali bhugarbheey hulchalon main fark he
 After the earthquake in Bhuj: Gujarat-based: Kakrapar plant was functioning and due to flooding after tsunami in South India: Kalapakkam plant located in Tamil Nadu was closed
 use kuch hi din baad dobaaraa shuru kar diya gaya
 Kakodkar said that after the experience of Japan, the designs of plants around the world will be made in a new way and they will improve
 bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish (sijei) ko soochna ke adhikaar (artiai) ke daayre main laane kaa faisla khud supreme court ne liya he
 This was a rare case in which the Supreme Court itself approached the Supreme Court against the High Court and the Supreme Court disposed of the Supreme Court, and decided to bring the Chief Justice of India under RTI but also imposed certain conditions
 
 sharten ye ki artiai kaa istemaal kisi nigaraanee ke taur par nahin hoga, colegium ne naam kis vajah se tay kiye hai, isaki jaankaree nahin milegi
 Along with this, information related to the judges and communication with the government will have to be shared but these will be decided case by case
 jajon kii sampatti kii jaankaree saarvajanik karne kaa jimmaa jajon par hi hoga
 But in this too the purpose of seeking public interest and information will be seen
 kul milakar dekha jaae to sijei ke daftar se suchanaaen lenaa tedi kheer hi hoga kyonki janhit ko siddh karne kaa jimmaa soochna maangane vaale par to hoga hi, saath hi supreme court bhi apane str par janhit tay karegaa
 In this judgment, the court has made interesting comments on public interest and personal information
 ye jaananaa isliye bhi jaruri he ki aam log apni nijee jaankariyon kaa hisaab bahut simit daayre main lagaate hai
 But this is an age of data and your data can be sold in it, so it is important to understand the scope of personal information
 supreme court ne kaha ki nyaayik uddharanon se sabit hota he ki naam, pataa, shaareerik, maansik or manovaigyanik avasthaa, ankatalika, grad, uttar pustika vyaktigat jaankaree hai
 Similarly, professional records including qualifications, performance, evaluation reports, acrs, disciplinary action are also personal information
 itnaa nahi nahin medical records, ilaaj, pasand kii dawa, aspataalon kii suchi or doctor se paraamarsh, jaanch report jinamein parijanon kii jaankaree bhi shaamil he, parisampattiyon kii jaankaree, daayitv, inakam tex ritern, nivesh kaa byoraa, karj lenaa-dena aadi bhi nijee jaankaree he
 Obtaining such private information in an unauthorized manner is a violation of privacy
 vyapak janhit main kush sharton ke saath in soochnaaon tak pahunchane kaa rasta khulaa hua he
 The court held that the list was a sample, not provisional
 isi tarah court ne public intrest yani janhit kii bhi vyakhya kii he ki isse aashay janakalyaan se he
 There is a big difference between public welfare and public interest
 adaalat ne kaha ki ye donon bilkul alag maandand hai
 For example, people may be interested in someone's personal issues, but it is possible that they have nothing to do with public welfare but are forced to express it
 aise janata kii dilchaspee se jude muddon khaarij karnaa chahie kyonki ye niztaa ke sangrakshan main aade aate hai
 The court said that the purpose of giving these examples is to protect the person's reputation and respect associated with the right to privacy
 adaalat ne kaha ki soochnaaon ko saajha karne main nyaayik swatantraaa kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie
 It also said that refusal to give information does not achieve judicial independence
 soochna ke adhikaar ke daayre main sijei ko laane kaa ye faisla upree taur par to bahut mahaan kadam dikhataa he lekin isaki thodi si hi sharton main isaki pechidgiyaan chhipi hui hai
 You can decide what information you will ask for, but what information will be made available by the CJI, it will be decided according to every case
 abhi bharat main nyaaypalika ko swatantra or loktantric hone main lanbaa safar tay karnaa he
 The demand for live streaming of the Ayodhya episode was received from the Supreme Court which was not met
 agar supreme court ko vaaki paardarshita lani he to sansad kii tarah pehle live strimming kii pahal kare or ye pahal hoicourt main bhi hona chahie
 The public wants to know more than information what happens inside the court
 adaalat kaa najaara apni ankhon se janata dekhegi to janata kii dilchaspee or janhit donon kaa lakshya sadh jayega
 *** kya aap jaanate hai kigopneey sarkari suchanaaen lighkarne kaa ek puraa racket he or har tarah ke dastavej kii alag-alag keemten hai

 Expressing a similar view, FICCI Secretary General Rajiv Kumar said, "the increase will have limited impact (impact on inflation) as petrol does not have much effect like diesel
 ’haalanki jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay main arthshaastra ke professor si pi chandrashekhar ne kaha ki petrol kii keemat kaa aam aadam ke bajet par asar hoga
 He said, 'petrol is also an important secondary product

 The Aam Aadmi Party is at the center of a huge controversy these days and its minister Somnath Bharti is in the grip of even more controversies
 vivaad or aam aadmi party main gaharaa rishta he
 Whether it is the statements of Kumar Vishwas or the case of Kumari Birla breaking the glass of the car, the party has been stuck in many controversies but these were all minor disputes that would not be appropriate to give up
 lekin dilli ke khidki gaanv main jis tarah se somnath bharti ne red karne kii koshish kii or police waalon ko dhamkaane kii koshish kii vah to apane aap main ek dukhad ghatana he
 He has probably forgotten how unfair it is to accuse prostitution and drug trade people from far-off Africa who have come to India to study or earn two days' bread
 ek vakil hone ke naate unhen kanoon kaa bhi gyaan hoga jo kahata he ki kisi mahila ko mard pulicekarmi giraftaar nahin kar sakate
 Knowing this, he ordered the police to arrest him in a very angry manner
 jab unhone inkaar kiya to vah dadaageeri par utar aae
 It would have been fine if the matter had ended here
 unki party ke pramukh arvind kejariwal ne unhen sahi sabit karne ke liye bahut bada andolan khadaa kar diya
 Besides this incident, Kejriwal also raised a case of rape of a woman from Denmark
 is maamle main bhi somnath bharti kii bhoomika sharmnaak rahi he
 He revealed the name of the victim, which is wrong law
 in donon maamalon ko dekhne ke baad to lagata he ki kanoon mantri kaa kanoon gyaan kamazor he
 How can a lawyer make such big mistakes? But by covering them all, he joined the movement
 unhen to arvind kejariwal ko rokna chahie tha
 But to maintain his grandeur, he used this matter very much
 vah chaahate to maamle ko or bhi tareeke se sulajhaa sakate the lekin unhone aisa karnaa uchit nahin samajha
 Perhaps he was thinking that this would increase his dominance in the city
 apane samarthakon ke saamne apana kad bada rakhane ke liye unhone andolan ko hawa di
 Surprisingly, the Aam Aadmi Party is seen defending its minister and complaining against the police
 agar duusari party ke netaa aisa karte to kya kejariwal chup baithte? dusron par aarope madh dene main to vah sabase aage rahe hai
 He does not miss such an opportunity
 lekin ab jab unke khud ke mantri aaropon ke ghere main hai, unke khilaaf exiaar ho gai he or un par racism kaa aarope lag rahaa he to aise main raajnneeti main shuchita or jiro tolerance kii baaten karne vaale kejariwal chup kyon baithe hai?is ghatana se to duniya bhar main racism se ladane vaale bharat kii antarrashtriya chhavi kharaab hui he
 Kejriwal should immediately seek the resignation of Somnath Bharti and ask him to sit till the investigation is complete
 ek nishpaksh jaanch ke liye bhi yah jaruri he ki vah istipha den
 It is also a critique of morality

 If the inhaler is not used properly, the drug particles do not reach the windpipe, due to which the medicine remains in the throat, it does not provide comfort to the patient
 "unhone kaha ki ek research ke anusaar inhiler ke galat istemaal ke kaaran gale main dawa ke kan ikatthe hone se gale ke cancer hone kaa khatra bhi hota he
 Therefore it is necessary to use the inhaler properly
 asthma ke peediton ko inhiler kaa prayog karte samay turant munh nahi kholana chahie, jisase dawa ke kan sidhe fefdon main pahunch saken
 Also, always check with the doctor for the right way to use inhaler, which can help in controlling asthma

 atyadhik pichhadaa varg (ibisi) ke liye panchayat main 20 fisadi aarakshan or bihar main mahadaliton tathaa muslimon ke kalyaan ke liye nitish ke uthaae vishesh kadamon ne lalu or paswan ke liye daliton, yadavon, muslimon or anya pichhadaa varg sambandhi apane jatigat gathbandhan par ateet jaisi pakad banaae rakhane ko thodaa mushkil jarur kiya he
 Lalu, who once ruled the state for fifteen years due to the overwhelming support of the Yadavs, Dalits and minorities in Bihar, was ousted from power in the 2005 assembly elections when Paswan deserted him and his rival Nitish
 Gained power in the rainbow coalition
 haalanki rashtriya janata dal (rajd) or lok janashakti party (lojpa) main siton ko lekar aupchaarik samajhaita hona abhi baaki he
 Not only this, there is also a possibility that RJD and LJP have not reached any solution for some seats which have become the root of the dispute
 in virodhabhaason ke baavjood is baat main koi shubahaa nahin he ki lalu or paswan gathbandhan ko amalijama pehanaane ke liye puri tarah se patibaddh najar aa rahe hai
 Till now, both these leaders have been successful in taking advantage of caste polarization for electoral gains
 agar loksabhaa chunaav 2009 ke sandarbh main dekhen to paristhitiyaan thodi alag najar aati hai kyonki muslim, mahadalit or atyadhik pichhadaa varg nitish kumaar ke rup main ek majboot vikalp khoj saktaa he
 For example, so far Muslims have probably supported Lalu and Paswan, but if they do a deep study, this time they can go with Nitish Kumar for a "better deal"
 sandesh ekadam saaf he, raajnneetik pravaah main koi bhi ek party yaa gathbandhan hameshaa ek jati yaa samudaay ke pratinidhitiv kaa daawa nahin kar saktaa kyonki ve aapako yah mauka nahin denge ki aap unhen hameshaa halke main hi len
 And that's why Lalu and Paswan have become pragmatic about their stand in the run-up to the 2009 general elections
 isi tarah, padosi rajya jharkhand main jharkhand mukti morcha (jhamumo) ne aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon main upie ke saath bane rahane kaa faisla liya he
 His decision has taken everyone by surprise as the Congress and the RJD had rejected all candidates of the JMM chief minister after Shibu Soren stepped down as chief minister, leading to a rift in the UPA in the state
 jhamumo ne pakhwaade bhar pehle apana rukh or kadaa kar liya tha or kaha tha ki vah bihar ke adivasee bahul pocket main rajd ke khilaaf ummidavaar utaaregaa
 Meanwhile, there were also indications of JMM joining BJP
 is par upie netritv ne harakat main aate hue tushtikaran kii niti par kaam shuru kar diya
 Under this, the Jharkhand Assembly was not dissolved, leaving Soren's hope of occupying the top post of Jharkhand alive
 shaayad yahi vah kaaran he jisane jhamumo pramukh ko hisaab baraabar karne ke liye majaboor kiya
 Further, Lalu worked on 9 March to heal wounds when he visited AIIMS in New Delhi to meet Soren
 aakhirkaar saare gile-shikave dur ho gaye or jhamumo ne upie ke saath bane rahane kii ghoshnaa kar daali
 But it is also worth noting that shortly before, Soren promised that he will continue to teach Lalu political lessons
 lekin gathbandhan ke in teenon sahyogiyon ko pataa he ki is baar rajya main unhen pichhali baar kii apeksha adhik mushkil chotii par vijay hasil kerani he
 In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the alliance won 12 out of 14 seats in the state
 bhaajapa ko sirf ek hi seat se santosh karnaa padaa tha joki baad main saansad babu laal marandi ke jharkhand vikaas party kaa gathan karne se haath se nikal gai thi
 This time also, the allocation of seats will be on the lines of 2004, four seats for JMM, six seats for Congress and two seats for RJD
 jharkhand main upie sahyogiyon ko sipii or marandi dwaara jiti gai siton par samajhaita karnaa baaki he
 Incidentally, jmm's coming to Congress after BJD withdrew from the BJP helped send a message to the Congress that the UPA is a better option
 haalanki vaastaviktaa main yah daawa abhi siddh hona baaki he
 But one of the reasons for the bjp's enthusiasm in Jharkhand is the poor administration of the UPA in the state
 2005 ke jharkhand vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad se nirdaleey vidhayakon ne satta ko manamafik haanka he
 However, it can be said that with the unification of the UPA alliance, everything will not be easy for the BJP
 rajnatik paryvekshakon ke mutabik, aam aadmi ke vaadon par bhaajapa ke khara na utar paane kaa 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav parinaamon par gaharaa asar padaa tha
 But now the circumstances have changed a lot
 haalanki sorain ke bete durga sorain ek baadha ke rup main ubhare hai
 Durga has asked Congress and RJD leaders to support the JMM candidate for the post of Chief Minister of Jharkhand before entering into an electoral alliance with Guruji
 vahiin, durga se mulaakaat karne vaale congress saansad phurkan ansaari ne bharosa jataayaa he ki jhamumo ke saath gathbandhan barkaraar rahegaa
 The validity of Article 35A giving special rights to Jammu and Kashmir is likely to be heard in the Supreme Court this week
 pulavama hamale main 40 javaanon kii shahadat ke baad mana ja rahaa he ki centre kii modi sarkaar kaa rukh mudde par badal saktaa he
 In such a situation, Mehbooba Mufti, former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, warned not to play with fire, that if Article 35A was attacked, they do not know which flag the people of Kashmir would raise instead of the tricolor
 jammu-kashmir kii purv mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne kaha, 'aag se mat khelen, 35e kaa baaja na bajaaen
 If this happens then you will see what has not happened since 1947
 agar is par hamalaa kiya jaataa he to main nahin jaanati ki jammu kashmir ke log tirange kii jagah koun sa jhanda pakadaney ko majaboor ho jaaenge
 Earlier, National Conference leader Omar Abdullah had said that it is only the responsibility of the Center and the Governor to conduct elections and let the people decide
 nai sarkaar anuchhed 35e ko bachaane ke liye khud faisla karegi
 It is worth noting that a hearing is already going on in the Supreme Court on a number of petitions challenging the statutory recognition of Article 35A in Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin pulavama hamale ke baad baad ek baar phir anuchhed 370 or anuchhed 35e ko hataane kii maang ne jor pakadaa he
 However, the Jammu and Kashmir administration has made its stand in the Supreme Court a day earlier that only the elected government can take a decision on Article 35A
 kya he anuchhed 35e?anuchhed 35e jammu-kashmir kii vidhansabha ko rajya main sthaayee naagarik kii paribhaasha tay karne kaa adhikaar detaa he
 According to this, no person outside Jammu and Kashmir can buy immovable property here
 iske saath hi kisi bahari vyakti ke yahaan kii mahila se shaadi karne par bhi sampatti par uskaa adhikaar nahin ho saktaa
 On 14 May 1954, the country's first President, Dr
 rajendra prasad ke aadesh par samvidhan main anuchhed 35e joda gaya tha
 The order was given under an agreement between Maharaja Hari Singh and the Government of India
 raashtrapati ne samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 (1) (d) ke jariye anuchhed 35e kaa praavdhaan kiya tha
 Accordingly, the President is free to take decisions regarding certain 'exceptions and changes' in the interest of Jammu and Kashmir
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki samvidhan main anuchhed 35e jodne ke liye uchit prakriya kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya
 Because the Constitution Amendment Act was not passed for Article 35A in the Constitution
 bijepi kaa litmus test bihar he jahaan isi saal vidhansabha chunaav hona he
 On the preparations of the party in the state, BJP general secretary in-charge Bhupendra Yadav spoke to chief correspondent Santosh Kumar: What will be the special issues of BJP for Mission Bihar? Good governance politics is needed in Bihar
 bijepi ke saath jedy(you) ne jab chunaav ladaa tha tab bhi mukhya rup se mudda yahi tha ki vahaan kanoon kaa raaj sthapit karne vaali sarkaar ho or bijepi ne us vikasvaadi soch ko shashan main rahete hue hameshaa aage badhaayaa
 Today Punarun Bihar needs a government with good governance and BJP is the best option
 bihar main argedy-jedy(you) kaa mahagathjod hua or ab uske vilay kii bhi charchaa he
 How will we compete? After the formation of Mahagathjod, Lok Sabha elections were held and Jharkhand assembly was elected
 chunki mahagathjod kisi vaicharik aadhaar, kisi thos sushasan kii niti or vishwasaneeyata ke netritv ke abhaav kaa gathjod he
 Like Delhi, will the party contest elections with a face in Bihar? Every state has its own way of election, right now the decision is on the BJP Parliamentary Board on all subjects
 rajya ikai team bihar ke rup main 185 siton ke lakshya ke saath kaam kar rahi he, vahi abhi ekmaatr ranneeti he
 Recently there was a lot of rhetoric about leadership
 gutbaji kaise rokenge?aisa koi vishay nahin he or party ke bheetar koi gutbaji nahin he
 Sometimes the press presented distorted by someone's statement is a different matter, but everyone has clarified the situation on the party forum
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav nateezon kaa asar bihar ke chunaav par dikhegaa?chunaav ke parinaamon kaa sakaaratmak asar hameshaa padataa he
 In Bihar, the caste factor works in elections
 kya ranneeti hogi?bijepi main sabhi samaaj or virgon ke logon kaa samaan pratinidhitiv rahata he
 We present an all-inclusive development model as our government, keeping the social balance of all classes
 modi lahar ke baavjood teen maheene baad vidhansabha ke upachunaav main bijepi ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 What was left behind? The party continues to serve as a vibrant party on all subjects
 parinaam jis prakaar ke bhi aaen sabhi parinaamon kii samiksha kii jaati he or janata ke saath samvaad, samanvay or unki sahabhaagita party main bani rahe is par ham vichaar karte hai
 Therefore, they analyze strategies and conduct strategies
 aap jis samudaay se aate hai vah bihar kii raajnneeti main ahm bhoomika nibhaataa he or lalu yadav us vot par apana daawa karte hai to kya party yadav chehron par zyada daanv lagaaegi?main ek party ke patibaddh kaaryakarta ke rup main kaam karata hum
 Any responsibility given to me is the decision of the top leadership of the party
 lekin jahaan tak lalu yadav kii baat he to unhone kitna kaam kiya he yah log jaanate hai
 All myths are about to break, society is about to go in a new direction and change
 jharkhand main bijepi ne pehali baar adivasee kii jagah ek pichde varg ke netaa ko siem banaaya
 Will myths be broken in Bihar as well? There is no thought for CM nor is it a topic right now

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has played a big role in this victory of the Congress

 Whereas despite the AAP having 8 councilors in the zone, the AAP chairman, deputy chairmen and standing committee lost the election as BJP and Congress together achieved a magical figure of 9 in the zone

 rajasthani bhashaa kii manyata ke liye rajasthan main or rajasthan se baahar andolan kaaphi vakt se chal rahe hai
 However, due to political reasons, Rajasthani language has not been recognized

 The CBI, which is investigating the murder case at Rayan School in Gurugram, did not give a clin chit to the bus conductor Ashok Kumar, arrested by the police today
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki abhi is cese se jude kai report aane hai
 Only after the investigation is complete will this CBI take a decision on it
 isliye sibiai ne ashok kii jamaanat kaa virodh kiya
 According to the information, if the CBI has not filed a charge sheet in this case for 90 days, the accused can go to the court for bail
 aise main adaalat use jamaanat par reeha kar sakati he
 Actually, Ashok Kumar's lawyer filed a bail application in the court
 is maamle par aaj court main sunwaayee hui he
 The bail was sought on the basis of these points - accused Ashok Kumar is innocent
 use galat tareeke se cese main fansaaya gaya he
 - Ashok is in judicial custody since the investigation
 usne jo aparaadh nahin kiya, uski bhi dhaaraon lagaai gai hai
 - There is no need for any recovery or inquiry from the accused bus conductor
 - is cese main doosraa aaropee pakadaa ja chukaa he
 In such a situation, there is no need for the custody of the bus conductor
 - aaropee gurugram ke ghamroj gaanv kaa sthai nivasee he
 He has no chance of escaping
 sibiai ne aaropee ashok kumaar ko shuruyaat main remand par lekar poochtacha kii thi
 The CBI then produced the accused in the court
 court ne use jail bhej diya tha
 Then the CBI caught the minor student in the case and said that he had murdered Pradyuman Thakur inside the school
 aaropee ke naaballig hone kii vajah se yah maamla philhal gudgaanv seshan court ke juvenil court main chal rahaa he
 Ashok's lawyer has filed his bail application in the Juvenile court itself
 aise main court ko aaropee ashok ko jamaanat par reeha karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 This right is with the CBI court, which is in Panchkula
 bataate chalem ki buudhvaar ko pradhyumna ke pita varun thakur aaropee ke khilaaf court pahunche the
 He wants the accused minor student to be treated as adult
 is sambandh main unhone jeje court main ek yachika daayar kii he

 faridabad ke ballabhagarh ke adarsh nagar main hitansion vir kii chapet main aane se teen bachche buree tarah jhulas gaye

 At the same time, Nageswara Rao has again been made the interim head of the CBI
 guuruuvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi kii adhyakshata vaali chayan samiti (selection committee) kii baithak main yah faisla liya gaya
 In this committee, apart from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, senior Supreme Court Justice AK Sikri and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge were included
 yah baithak pradhanmantri narendra modi ke awaas par hui, jo kareeb do ghante se zyada samay tak chali
 In this meeting Mallikarjun Kharge disagreed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Justice Sikri and lodged some objections
 in sabake baavjood panel ne 2-1 se faisla liya or alok verma ko nideshak pad se hataakar fire services and home guard kaa diarector general (DG) bana diya
 Earlier on Tuesday, the Supreme Court reinstated Alok Verma as the CBI Director
 unhen sarkaar ne kareeb do maheene pehle jabaran chuttee par bhej diya tha
 After being reinstated by the Supreme Court, in a meeting chaired by PM Modi on Thursday, he was removed from the post of CBI Director and decided to fire services
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki is mudde par samiti kii yah duusari baithak he
 Earlier, the meeting on Wednesday was inconclusive
 alok verma or vishesh nideshak rakesh asthana ne ek-duusare par bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaae the, jiske baad unhen jabaran chuttee par bhej diya gaya tha
 On Wednesday, Alok Verma canceled most of the transfers made by m Nageswara Rao as soon as he took over as CBI director
 nageshwar raav ko alok verma kii anupasthiti main antarim sibiai pramukh niyukt kiya gaya tha
 It is being told that the officers whose transfer orders were canceled by Alok Verma are considered to be Verma's confidant
 niyamanusaar pradhanmantri kii adhyakshata vaali is samiti main chif justise yaa supreme court ke ek justise or loksabhaa main netaa pratipaksh shaamil hote hai
 Officials said that AK Sikri, senior Supreme Court judge nominated by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha, attended the meeting on Wednesday
 khadge ne is maamle main kendriya satarkta ayog kii jaanch report samet dastavej maange hai
 Kharge said, 'I have sought some documents from the government in relation to the case, including the investigation reports of the CVC
 ’ chif justise gogoi us peeth kaa hissaa the, jisane mangalvaar ko verma ko sibiai nideshak pad par behaal karne kaa aadesh diya tha, isliye unhone panel kii baithak se khud ko alag rakhane kaa faisla kiya
 At present there is no Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, because no opposition party got 10 percent seats of the total members
 mallikarjun khadge loksabhaa main vipaksh ke sabase bade dal congress ke netaa hai
 The apex court had asked the government to call a meeting within a week of its decision
 Fear is now rampaging through Mr Modi’s mind

 Sacking the CBI Chief # alokvermatwice in a row, clearly shows that he is now a prisoner of his own lies
 Satyamev Jayate
 - Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi) January 10, 2019 Rahul Gandhi spoke directly against PM Modi, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has also tweeted about the removal of Alok Verma from the post of CBI Chief
 is masale ko lekar piem modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha, 'ab mistar modi ke dimag main dar baith gaya he
 They cannot sleep
 unhone vayusena ke 30 hajaar karod rupee churaae or anil ambani ko de diya
 The dismissal of CBI Chief Alok Verma for the second time clearly shows that he has now fallen victim to his own lies
 ' Lalu Prasad Yadav, after keeping distance from active politics under a well thought-out strategy for more than a year, is now ready for the contest
 is saal kii may se lekar ab tak argedy pramukh ne 2,000 kimi se zyada kii lambii sadak yatra kar bihar ke darjanabhar se zyada jilon kaa daura kiya or utani hi jansabhaon ko sambodhit kiya jinamein logon kii taadaad kaaphi acchhee rahi he
 This is the new rise of Lalu on the political scene
 gauratlab he ki purv rail mantri lalu prasad yadav november, 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main buree tarah haarane ke baad apane khol main simat gaye the
 His wife Rabri Devi had lost both the seats in that election and the rjd's strength had come down from 54 to 22 in the 243-member Bihar assembly
 is chunavi haar ke baad lalu ne maan liya tha ki bihar kii janata ne unhen khaarij kar diya he or unke paas logon ke bich jane kii koi thos vajah nahin bachi thi
 His frustration grew so much that he did not attend the anniversary of his party's anniversary in July 2011
 is dauraan sirf ek baar sitambar, 2011 main police golibari or hinsa ke peediton se milane ke liye ve arriya jile ke farbishganj or nitish kumaar ke grih jile nalanda gaye
 Both these visits also became formal and Lalu once again disappeared from the political arena of Bihar
 jedy-you ke mantri hari prasad saah ke nidhan ke baad khaali hui laukaahaa vidhansabha seat par november, 2011 main hue upachunaav ke dauraan ek baar phir ve logon ke bich najar aae
 Although the RJD lost in this by-election, the party's votes increased by 10,000, which led to Lalu's grip as the main opposition party in Bihar once again
 voton main hua yah ijapha siyaasi surang ke duusare chor par lalu ke liye roshni kii kiran sabit hua
 Exactly six months later, Lalu addressed a massive public meeting against police brutality in Aurangabad, where people protesting against the killing of a chief Devendra Singh Kushwaha were beaten
 lalu ne jis tareeke se apane daure or usamen dene waalon bhaashanon ko shakl di he, usase jaan padataa he ki apane khoe hue janaadhar ko waapas paane ke liye unhone kaaphi satark tareeke se ranneeti banaai he
 In July, he targeted Chief Minister Nitish Kumar against the arrest of Muslim youths on his Darbhanga tour, while on his five-day tour from West Champaran to Gaya in the second week of July, he campaigned for central universities in both places
 is baat ko ek maah bhi nahin beetaa tha ki shrey lene kii hode main centre sarkaar ne donon sthanon par kendriya vishvavidhyalay banaae jane ko manjuuri de daali
 They have visited Nalanda and Gopalganj last fortnight
 unhone motorcycle or naav se in yatraaon ko puraa kiya
 Lalu has given up his old habit of hollow idioms, taking lessons from the past
 isaki bajaae ve khud ko sarkaar virdohi chehre ke rup main sthapit karne main lag gaye hai or nitish kumaar ke daavon or vaadon ke khokhalepan se mohabhang kii sthiti main aa chuki janata main vyaapt asantosh ko apane paksh main bhunaane main lage hue hai
 Lalu has chosen the right time for his campaign
 agle loksabhaa chunaav ko do saal se bhi kam samay rah gaya he or bihar main gathbandhan sarkaar ke ghatakon-jedy-you or bijepi ke bich rishte bhi bighad chuke hai
 People of Lalu's party have also started feeling that a lot of resources and energy has been gathered which should be used to measure political water in Bihar
 iske baavjood lalu ke saath kai pareshaaniyaan bhi judi hai
 After being out of power for many years, all this was not easy for Lalu because Nitish has hurt Lalu's social base a lot during this period
 iske alaava satta virdohi bhaavana ko bhunaane ke liye lalu ke paas jo vishwasaneeyata honi chahie, vah nahin he
 Worse, Lalu's health is now responding and his adversaries are busy campaigning that they will no longer be able to bear the burden of active public life
 dhyaan rahe ki march, 2012 main lalu ko dilli ke akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan main aswasthta ke kaaran bhartee karavaaya gaya tha
 Another major problem with him is that there is no reliable leadership in the party after him
 jis tarah mulaayam singh yadav ne apane baad kaman sanbhaalane ke liye bete akhilesh yadav ko taiyaar kiya, mana ja rahaa he ki unheen kii tarj par lalu apane bete 22 varshiya tejasvi yadav ko chamakaane kaa man bana chuke hai
 For the moment, he has deliberately postponed the scheme so that senior party leaders are not hurt
 kuch netaa unki is taiyaari se khafa hai
 Tejashwi participated extensively in his mother's campaign in the 2010 assembly elections, but so far he has not expressed his eagerness to enter the mainstream
 lalu apni party ke keel-kaante durust karne main ek had tak safal rahe hai
 Two disgruntled mps of the party - Jagadanand Singh and Raghuvansh Prasad Singh - have started taking part in the campaign against the NDA government of Bihar
 party main lalu samet kul chaar loksabhaa saansad hai jinamein se teen saansad andruni matbhed ke kaaran party gatividhiyon se duuri banaakar chal rahe the
 The complaint of fourth MP Umashankar Singh seems to have not been resolved yet
 udhar uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main safaaye ke baad se thandi padi congress ab lalu ke haath majboot karne main lag gai he
 Says a senior Congress leader, "lalu is the biggest force against the NDA in Bihar despite weak performances in the 2009 and 2010 elections
" hamaara taatkaalik lakshya 2014 ke chunaavon main zyada-se-zyada saansadon ko jitaana he or aisa ham kshetreey partiyon ko saath liye bagaiyr nahin kar sakate
 The Congress has only two mps from Bihar in the current Lok Sabha
 lalu kii ummid ek or cheez par tiki he
 RJD received 54,66,693 votes despite poor performance in the last assembly elections, which is about 19 per cent of the total votes cast
 argedy ke netaaon kaa maananaa he ki party ke aadhaar kaa istemaal kar ke ramvilas paswan kii lok janashaktiparty ne jo 6
 75 percent of the vote shocks, they can be regained
 mana ja rahaa he ki argedy kaa paaramparik vot bank yani yadav jisaki sankhya rajya kii kul aabaadi kaa 15 fisadi he, lalu ke peeche majbootee se khadaa he
 After all, wherever the support for a leader who lost his fort came from, he would join his account
 buraai par achchhai kii jeet kaa tyohaar vijayadashami deshbhar main dhoomdhaam se manaaya ja rahaa he
 On the day of Dussehra, burning of effigies of Ravana is organized from place to place

 The new BJP president Nitin Gadkari has denied himself being appointed to the post by the Sangh and insisted that he is making his own decisions after consulting senior party leaders and Sangh leaders
 unhone is baat par bhi jor diya ki vah kendriya netritv ke haath main kathputli kii tarah nahin hai
 "the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has been a part of my life as the President of Maharashtra BJP in the last four years," Gadkari said in an interview on a private news channel
 lekin sangh netaaon ne kabhi mujhe nirdesh nahin diya
 And even as BJP President, i am taking my own decisions
 ’’gadakari ne is baat par jor diya ki sabase pehle bhaajapa netaa laalkrishna adwani or purv adhyaksh rajnath singh ne hi suzav diya tha ki unhen bhaajapa adhyaksh banaaya janaa chahie
 He denied that Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat had imposed him on the BJP
 unhone kaha, ‘‘kuch logon ke dimag main dharna bani hui he ki sangh bhaajapa par niyantran kar rahaa he
 This is not the right thing
 ve hamaari din-ba-din kii gatividhiyon main, ummidavaaron ke chayan main or raajnneeti main koi hastkshep nahin karte
 However, Gadkari admitted that the Sangh and BJP have a principled relationship and the party often discusses the Sangh on a number of issues
 jab gadakari se poocha gaya ki kya bhaajapa sangh kii kisi salaah ko khaarij kar sakati he to unhone kaha, ‘‘haa kai baar
 There is democracy in the Union
 main bhi jab sangh main sarvocch netaa ke paas jaataa hum to unase charchaa kar saktaa hum or unke saath apane vichaaron ko saajha kar saktaa hum
 If there is any decision of the Sangh in this matter, every volunteer is ready to accept it
 ’’bhaajapa adhyaksh ne bhagwat or purv sangh pramukh ke
 s
 sudarshan ko loktantric netaa qaraar diya, jinke saath vah akasar kai muddon par baatcheet karte hai or kai maukon par matbhed bhi rahe hai
 Asked about the bjp's identity from the Kandhamal riots in Orissa, Ramsena in Karnataka and Varun Gandhi's alleged inflammatory speeches, Gadkari said, "we are a democratic party
" party main anek netaa hai, jinke vichaar alag alag hai
 He argued that they do not represent the views of the party
 unhone kaha, ‘‘jahaan tak ram sena kii baat he, yah pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh taur par bhaajapa se nahin judi
 There is a section of people, who have decided that they will connect everything with the BJP
 ’’ gadakari ne is baat par jor diya ki dilli kii raajnneeti main bhale hi vah naye hai, lekin unhen varisht netaaon kaa purna sahyog praapt he or vah party ko acchhee sthiti main pahunchane main shat pratishat safal honge
 Four senior party leaders Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, M
 venkaiya naidu or anant kumaar se sahyog ke sawaal par gadakari ne kaha, ‘‘ve dil se meraa sahyog kar rahe hai or unhone mujhe uchit tarah se rasta bataaya he
 Admitting that he was new to central politics, he rejected that senior leaders were making him a puppet
 unhone kaha, ‘‘unka aisa koi iraadaa bilkul nahin he
 Those who know me know that i will never be a puppet
 ’’ gadakari ne kaha ki vah bhaajapa kaa mat pratishat congress se 10 pratishat badhanaa chaahate hai
 According to Gadkari, "they have to focus on the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Minorities and unorganized class workers
" yadi ham is par dhyaan dete hai, to hamaara kuch vot pratishat badhegaa
 Gadkari said that BJP will work on Antyodaya ideology of Deen Dayal Upadhyay to serve the last person standing in the queue
 unhone hindutv ko jeevanstyli kii sangya di or ise saanskrithik rashtrawaad se judaa bataaya
 Gadkari defended the differences between the party in Rajasthan, Bihar, Karnataka and Uttarakhand, saying that BJP is a democratic party and therefore different from other parties
 unhone kaha ki unke party adhyaksh banane ke baad rajasthan ikai kii dikkat ko sulajhaa liya gaya he
 With China not withdrawing from its stand against India's membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), Foreign Secretary s Jaishankar advocated a 'rational and practical' dialogue on both sides to ensure that each other's aspirations were not in place
 How is giving detrimental to the entire relationship
 videsh sachiv ne yah bhi kaha ki bharat ko china main apni chhavi sudhaarney ke liye apni soft power kaa istemaal karnaa chahie tathaa or bhi bahut kuch karnaa chahie, kyonki vahaan ke logon ko is desh ke bare main uchit tareeke se nahin pataa
 The Foreign Secretary's comments came in a report of the Standing Committee of the Ministry of External Affairs on India's soft power, which was tabled in the Lok Sabha yesterday
 report main jaishankar ke hawaale se kaha gaya he, 'meraa maananaa he ki hamen philhal china ke saath jo dikkatein hai unhen maanane se inkaar nahin karnaa chahie'
 According to the Foreign Secretary, "therefore, at this time it is necessary to have a reasonably practical dialogue with China about how not giving place to each other's aspirations is not beneficial for the relationship
" hamen baatcheet kerani chahie or ham karenge'
 He was answering a question regarding whether soft power could be used in India's negotiations with China
 enesji ke mudde par jaishankar ne kaha ki soft power kaa ek mahatv he, lekin yah kuch gambhir kathor prabhaavshaalee daleelon kii jagah nahin le sakati
 The committee headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor also said that apart from Bollywood and Indian folk culture, Indians have an important role in promoting the soft power of the country
 tippaniyan The committee feels that the government has been able to take advantage of India's soft power only in a fragmented manner, with no supporting policy or concomitant financial resources
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The Foreign Secretary also said that India should use its soft power to improve its image in China and do more, because the people there do not know about this country properly
 bharat kii soft power par videsh mantralay kii sthai samiti kii ek report main videsh sachiv kii ye tippaniyan ai hai, jise kal loksabhaa main pesh kiya gaya
 The report quoted Jaishankar as saying, "I believe that we should not refuse to accept the problems with China at the moment"
 videsh sachiv ke mutabik, 'isliye is samay china ke saath is bare main tarksangat vyaavhaarik baatcheet jaruri he ki kis tarah se ek duusare kii aakankshaon ko jagah nahin dena sambandhon ke liye laabhakaari nahin he
 We should talk and we will
 vah is sambandh main ek prashn kaa uttar de rahe the ki kya china ke saath bharat kii baatcheet main soft power kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The rapist of Mumbai, who has been arrested by the police, shows no end to his sin
 jaise-jaise police aage bad rahi he nae nae khulaase ho rahe hai
 According to the police, the tantric was a teacher of Arabic
 vah saal 1999 main mumbai aayaa tha
 It also taught Arabic to 6 girls who have raped it
 unhen maheene main 6 din arabi bhashaa padhaata tha or do din unase balaatkaar karata tha
 When this tantrik raped those girls, all the girls were minors at that time
 police ne bataaya he ki ye chaar saalon se ladakiyon se balaatkaar karata aar rahaa tha
 Two of these girls were also aborbed
 ab police us doctor ko bhi giraftaar karegi, jisane in bacchiyon ko aborshan kiya tha
 The crime of Javed Khadim's crimes is getting longer
 is mahapapi kaa mayajaal kahaan tak failaa tha, iskaa andaaza lagaana philhal mushkil he
 Gradually, the layers of its crimes are opening one by one
 police ke saamne ek ek apane saare raaj or thikaanon kaa pataa ugal rahaa he javed
 Police has raided one of its flats in Kalyan
 is chhapemari main abtak ek karod rupye ke nagad or gahane baraamad ho chuke hai
 The count of tantrik's stolen assets is still on
 police kaa kahana he ki ye baramadagi to uske sirf ek thikaane se hui he
 More tantric treasures are yet to be explored
 police kii maane to dakshin mumbai, thane or central mumbai main bhi uske ghar hai
 According to the things this pretender tantric told the police in interrogation, he earned all this money and jewelry by pretending to be black magic
 tantric kii giraftaar ravivaar ko hui thi
 It was brought to the lockup by those who were its most innocent victims
 is tantric ne ek hi parivaar kii 6 betiyon ko ek-ek kar apni havas kaa shikaar banaaya tha
 Three of them were minors
 isaki karatuut kitni ghinauni he, iskaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki jin bacchiyon ko isane apni havas kaa shikaar banaaya unamem se ek kii umr mahaj 12 saal thi
 First, the tantric caught the mother of a girl in a bluff
 tantra-mantra se uski mushkilen dur karne kaa daawa kiya or phir dhire-dhire us mahila kii do or bahanon ko jhaanse main lekar unki betiyon se balaatkaar kiya
 All these women wanted a son, and the tantrik played such a disgusting game with their daughters, cashing in on this desire
 police kaa maananaa he ki jis kadar iske ghar se saamaan or sampatti baraamad ho rahi he usase shaq he ki isane auki bhi kai pariwaron ko apane jaal main fansa he
 He hopes that gradually this tantrik was victimized and more women can come forward
 yani is tantric kii kaali duniya ke kuch or bhi rongte khadey karne vaale khulaase abhi baaki hai

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reiterated in the Lok Sabha that during the securing of the trust vote in 2008, no Congress or government person had taken any illegal route nor his government had authorized anyone to do so
 loksabhaa main vot ke badale note vishay ke bare main pradhanmantri dwaara 18 march ko sadan main kii gayi kathith galatabayani par vipaksh kii maang par niyam-193 ke tahat hui charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue singh ne kaha, ‘gaiyr kanoonee jariya apnaane main congress yaa meri sarkaar kaa koi bhi vyakti shaamil nahin tha or na hi maine kisi ko aisa karne ke liye adhikrut kiya tha
 Rejecting allegations of alleged misrepresentation about the 'findings of the committee', he said that keeping the report of the parliamentary committee investigating the matter, the then Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee had said that the report does not prove it at all That the alleged persons, who had been asked to give money to mps carrying bags of money in the Lok Sabha, actually provided that money Was Raya
 ‘maine vahi kaha he, jo somnath ne us samay kaha tha
 Generally speaking, the soft-spoken Singh has taken a strong stance and said that he has been the target of opposition attack since the time of the finance minister in his political life
 unhone sadan main maujuud bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ko nishaanaa banaate hue kaha, ‘adwani ji ko vishwaas tha ki pradhanmantri bananaa unka janmasiddh adhikaar tha
 He has never forgiven me for being the Prime Minister
 ’ baad main singh ne yahi bayaan rajyasabha main bhi diya
 Amidst the thumping of the tables of the ruling party, he quipped, 'advani ji has given us a mandate in the free and fair elections
 ab aap saadhe teen saal or intjaar kiijie
 During the discussion, the leader of the opposition, Sushma Swaraj, attacked the attack on him through a lion and he retaliated through a lion
 sushamaa ne subah kaha tha, ‘tu idhar udhar kii na baat kar, ye bataa ke kaaravaan kyon lutaa, mujhe rahajanon (lutere) se gilaa nahin, teri rahabari (netritv) kaa sawaal he
 'singh read a counter-lion,' i agree that i am not capable of your heart, you see my hobby and see my wait
 ’ is par satta paksh ne der tak megen thapthapaakar pradhanmantri kii vaahvahee kii, vahiin vipaksh khamokh baitha rahaa
 The Prime Minister quoted Somnath as saying that the report of the committee said that there is a need to investigate the role of three mps who came to the House carrying bags of money
 samiti ne yah bhi kaha tha ki sudhindra kulkarni sahit jin teen vyaktiyon ke is maamle main shaamil hone kaa zikr he, uske bare main kisi sakasham agency se aage jaanch karaayi jaae
 Singh said that the matter was handed over to Delhi Police and further investigation is on
 ‘ab sadan tay kare ki kya report main kahin bhi aisi koi baat kahi gayi he, jis tarah ke bebuniyaad aarope vipakshi sadsy laga rahe hai
 He reiterated that it is not possible for the Government of India to verify the authenticity of the contents of the conversation between the Embassy of India of a country and the administration of that country
 kisi samprabhu desh or uske duutavas ke bich hui baatcheet kii ham jaanch bhi nahin kar sakate
 During the debate in the Lok Sabha on the issue of black money, senior BJP leader LK Advani appealed to the government to bring back the black money
 isi mudde par loksabhaa main bijepi ke sthagan prastaav ko manjuuri mil gai
 Advani said, "opening of accounts in foreign banks without written permission is also a legal offense
 unhone kaha ki kaale dhan ko waapas laane ke liye kya kiya gaya or uske nattejey kya hue sarkaar ko yah bataanaa chahie
 Advani also asked the government that several notices were sent on black money, what action did the Center take on the culprits
 loksabhaa main kaarysthgan prastaav ke tahat kaale dhan par charchaa kii shuruuaat karte hue adwani ne sarkaar se kaha ki videshon main kaala dhan rakhane vaale bhartiya logon ke jo bhi naam use mili hai, unhen sangrakshan dene ke bajaay vah unki puri suchi turant desh ke saamne rakhe
 He said, 'the government should release the complete list of the black money holders
 koi bhi naam chipaaya nahin janaa chahie
 Do not defend anyone possessing black money abroad and tell us if we have any name
 ’unhone kaha ki yah baat unki samaj se pare he ki sarkaar ko jab videshon main kaala dhan rakhane vaale 600 se adhik logon ke naamon kaa pataa lag gaya he to vah unhen desh ko bataane main kyon jhijak rahi he
 In the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, the senior BJP leader cautioned against leaving only tax to Indian people who have black money abroad and said, "only tax from Indian people who have black money abroad The matter should not be ended, but such people should be punished
 ’kaale dhan ke bare main shwetapatr jari karne kii maang karte hue adwani ne kaha ki isamen is baat kaa bhi ullekh hona chahie ki sarkaar ne ab tak videshon main jamaa bharatiyon ke kaale dhan ko waapas laane ke liye kya praytn kiye hai
 Advani said that all BJP mps have given an affidavit in their respective houses in Parliament on the occasion of anti-corruption Day on December 9 that they do not have any illegal account or property abroad
 unhone sarkaar se kaha ki vah aisa niyam banaaye jiske tahat sabhi saansadon ke liye yah aavashyak ho ki vah apane apane sadan main yah halafanama den ki videshon main uskaa koi avaidh khaataa yaa sampatti nahin he
 Advani, while speaking in the 15th Lok Sabha as part of the first adjournment motion, argued in the context of allegations of not trying to bring back black money from abroad during the NDA rule
 did not do
 yah sthiti pehle nahin thi
 Amid the laughter of members of the ruling party, he said that the situation has changed after the UN Security Council's pact against corruption
 unhone kaha ki america par aatankwaadi hamalaa hone ke baad us sahit france, britain or germany aadi ne kaala dhan rakhane vaale bainkon par dabaav bananaa shuru kiya or iske chalate naam ujagar hone prarambh hue
 At the time when Advani was speaking on black money, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and General Secretary Rahul Gandhi were not present in the House
 adwani ne sarkaar se sawaal kiya ki videshon se bharatiyon ke kaala dhan laane main or aisa karne waalon ke naam bataane main sarkaar ko aakhir dikkat kya he
 He also wanted to know why the government delayed the ratification of the United Nations until 2011 when the United Nations anti-corruption Treaty came into existence in 2003
 ‘videshi bainkon main avaidh rup se jamaa dhan se utpann sthiti’ par kaarysthgan prastaav par charchaa main hissaa lete hue adwani ne hawala maamle main jail main band hasan ali kaa ullekh karte hue sarkaar se jaananaa chaha ki aakhir yah koun vyakti he or uske kis kis se sambandh hai
 The BJP leader urged the government to reveal the names of Indians with black money abroad as soon as possible, lest we face the embarrassing situation in 2012 when Julian Assange on wikileaks would do so
 gauratlab he ki asanje ne pichley dinon kaha tha ki vah 2012 main videshon main kaala dhan rakhane vaale bharatiyon kii suchi jari kar sakate hai
 The BJP leader called the Prime Minister's estimate of Rs 25 lakh crore black money as almost correct, and said that by bringing this money back, he should invest in more than six lakh villages of the country
 unhone kaha ki aisa kar dene se bharat duniya ke sabase aadhunik gaanvon vaala desh ban jayega or isse desh bhi duniya kii pehali pankti main khadaa najar aayega

 In the same way, it fits well on today's Pakistan where your religious affiliation - whether it is born or received - can take you to the grave
 yahaan kaatil lagaataar bina kisi dar ke katl karte jate hai or police yaa fouj isamen khaas dakhal nahin detii
 There are many Pakistanis who hate people of other religions but they do not like the people of their religion
 kai logon ne majahab ke naam par kii jane vaali jyadatiyon kii ore se munh mode liya he
 What has happened to Hindus and Christians here is not surprising
 ye donon samudaay bharat ke bantwaare ko lekar kabhi utsahit nahin rahe
 Immediately after the partition, they were converted into "minorities" by imposing objective resolutions of 1949 and thus marginalizing the murderers and the alien
 kuch ne ise kismat maan liya or chupchaap pade rahe
 There were others who kept the names of Muslims known to them
 jo behatar sthiti main the, ve palaayan kar baahar chale gaye or apane saath nakadi or keemtee saamaan bhi lete gaye
 Once again, migration of people from other religions has gained momentum in the last few years
 pakistan kii 20 karod aabaadi main 1
 7 per cent are Hindus
 yah sankhya ghat rahi he kyonki hindu parivaar bharat main panaah maang rahe hai
 According to Pakistan Hindu Council President Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, the reasons are "kidnapping, rape, forced conversion of girls, kidnapping of traders for ransom and blackmailing and recovery
" ’’ iske alaava daftaron main kiya jane vaala bhedbhaav kai yogya hindu yuvakon ko berozegaar or hataash kar chukaa he
 Christians living in Pakistan are facing more difficulties
 march main isaayiyon ke 100 se zyada makaan or do chote girjagharon ko lahore main gussaye musalamaanon ne aag ke hawaale kar diya
 Sawan Christ, a Christian scavenger, was accused of blaspheming during an argument with a Muslim friend
 isse pehle 2009 main ek afvaah udi thi ki kuch isaayiyon ne quran kaa ek panna faad diya, jisaki pratikriya main gojara shahar main 20,000 musalamaanon kii bheed ne 50 isai makaanon main aag laga di thi
 Similarly in 1997, a village named Shantinagar was destroyed
 is ghatnakram ke dauraan haalanki jo sabase zyada sadame main hai, ve hai yahaan ke shiya or ahmadi samudaay ke log
 There was no lack of enthusiasm for the formation of Pakistan
 khud gujarati shiya parivaar main paidaa hue mohammad ali jinna maanate the ki hindu or muslim to kabhi chaun se ek saath nahin rah sakate lekin musalmaan ek saath rah sakate hai
 He was highly appreciative of the arguments made by Ahmadiyya leader Chaudhary Zafarullah Khan in favor of the two-nation theory and in 1947 made him the first foreign minister of Pakistan
 jinna to jaldi guzar gaye, lekin jafrulla khan kii kismat main bebasii ke din dekhnaa likhaa tha
 That is what happened after fear of partition, there was a debate in Pakistan which version of Islam is right
 is bahes ne kaaphi jehar gholne kaa kaam kiya
 This is the question at the root of the killing of his own brothers and brothers, which is weakening Pakistan day by day
 haal tak pakistani shiya khud ko dharmik alpsankhyak nahin samajhate the
 When the Ahmadis were declared non-muslim by Bhutto in 1974, the Sunnis along with the Sunnis also supported the decision
 lekin aaj shiya ghabaraae hue hai kyonki sunni kattarpathiyon kii maang he ki unhen bhi kafir ghoshit kiya jaae
 The tribal areas have been embroiled in such separatist battles: Kurram, Parachinar and Hangu have been transformed into shia-sunni cemeteries, with more graves of Shia
 shahari jivan main bhi teji se asuraksha or algaav panapata ja rahaa he
 This can be understood from the Shia mohallas of Karachi which are almost fortified
 iske baavjood ek aatmghaatee hamalavar barood bhari car lekar abbaas toun main ghus hi gaya or uske baad ke najaare main sirf toote hue apartment or balakani se latake insaani gosht ke tukade bache rah gaye
 The process of identifying Shias separately for about 20 percent of the population continues in the Gestapo style
 pichley saal fouj kii vardi pahane kuch logon ne rawalpindi se gilgit ja rahi chaar basen rukvaa lee thim
 People with Shia names like Abbas or Jafri were sorted and minutes later 46 corpses were seen lying on the ground
 mastung or queta main hajaaraa shiyaon kaa kiya gaya narsanhaar yahaan baar-baar doharaaya gaya he
 The Shia are still in such numbers that they try to save themselves, but this is not the case with the Ahmadis
 rawalpindi main unke iklaute dharmasthal par 5,000 kii acroshit bheed ne yah maang karte hue hamalaa bolaa tha ki vahaan lage suraksha camere or bairicade hataae jaaen
 Later this shrine had to be closed
 skulon main pard rahe ahmadiya bacchon kaa dharm pataa lagate hi unhen nikaal diya jaataa he or unhen khud ko muslim kehane se roka jaataa he
 Kadiyani was added to the name of Rahil Ahmed, an Ahmadi student at a high school in Mansera, and thus the boy was denied the opportunity to study in the university
 yahaan tak ki ahmadiyon ko marane ke baad bhi chaun nahin heru khatm-e-nabuvvat sanghathan main khabar ai ki 17 saal kii ek shikshika nadia hanif ko jisaki 10 din pehle beemaari se maut ho chuki thi, ahmadi hone ke baavjood kasoor ke chandasingh gaanv ke ek muslim kabristaan main dafnaaya gaya he
 After this, his grave was immediately dug up and the corpse was taken out to be buried again
 agle maheene chunaav ke baad nai sarkaar aa jaaegi lekin isse koi fark nahin padataa kyonki kaatil apni marji se yahaan katl karte hai, sarkaar yaa fouj ke kehane par nahin
 The government of Pakistan sits silently with all its guns and guns and watches the spectacle
 kuch log ise uski kamajori maanate hai to kuch duusare mileebhagat
 Whatever be the truth, but the fact is that even a large number of intelligence agents have not been able to trace the clout of religious terrorists
 agar sarkaar kabhi aatankiyon ko nishane par lene kaa dam bhi bharti he, to adaalat main unhen sajaa nahin hoti
 Last year, Malik Ishak, a self-styled Shia assassin, was released simply because the judges were scared of him and welcomed him as a guest in the court
 bantwaare ko to ulataa nahin ja saktaa, bhale hi aresas ke charampanthi uske khwab dekhte rahen
 To rectify the post-partition situation, Pakistan must forge itself as a state that treats every citizen with equal proportions and crushes the zeal that prevails here in jihad
 yah naammumkin nahin he
 India can help Pakistan in this work
 bas uski bhashaa ko naram banane or aapasi rishton ko garmjoshi se bharne kii darkaar he
 This step can reduce the impact of Pakistan's militant Islamists

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has launched a major attack on the Congress contesting with the Muslim League in Kerala
 yogi adityanath ne muslim lig ko virus bataate hue kaha ki ek aisa virus jisase koi sankramit ho gaya to wo batch nahin saktaa or aaj to mukhya vipakshi dal congress hi isse sankramit ho chukaa he
 Think what will happen if they win? This virus will spread throughout the country
 bataa den ki kerala main congress kaa muslim lig ke saath gathbandhan he
 Yogi Adityanath is attacking Congress and Rahul Gandhi for this
 yogi adityanath ne kaha ki 1857 ke swatantraaa sangram main mangal pandey ke saath puraa desh angrejon ke khilaaf mil kar ladaa tha, phir ye muslim lig kaa virus aayaa or aisa failaa ki puure desh kaa hi bantwaaraa ho gaya
 Today the same danger was in store again
 hare jhande phir se lahar rahe
 Congress is infected with Muslim League virus, be careful
 muslim lig ek virus he
 a virus with which someone has been infected cannot survive and today the main opposition party Congress has been infected by it
 sochiye agar ye jeet gaye to kya hoga ? ye virus puure desh me fail jayega
 - Chowkidar Yogi Adityanath (@myogiadityanath) April 5, 2019 Let us know that earlier on Thursday, Yogi Adityanath also attacked Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 unhone rahul gandhi or congress party par sampradayikta failaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Yogi Adityanath said that in Wayanad, Rahul Gandhi refused the workers of his special ally Muslim League in Kerala not to come to the rally with his party's green flag or else the UP voter would be angry
 ye muslim lig se samjhauta kar chunaav lade to secular? ham 'sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas' karen to bhi sampradayik?unhone aage kaha ki congress ke kaaran hi desh kaa durbhagyapurna vibhaajan hua
 For this, the alliance of Muslim League and Congress was responsible, today Rahul Gandhi has nominated from Wayanad and there too Congress has alliance with Muslim League
 yah desh ke liye gambhir chintaa kaa vishay he
 Congress is becoming a threat to the country
 lagaataar hamalavar he bijepibataa den ki jab se rahul gandhi ne vynad se chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he, tabhi se hi congress bijepi ke nishane par aa gai he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi also took a dig at Rahul without naming, saying that some people are so nervous with Hindus that they are contesting the minority-dominated seat so that they do not have to lose from the Hindu-majority seat
