 Buy a big bed: According to research, a person changes sides at least 60 to 70 times at bedtime
 aise main agar bed chota ho to saath sone vaale ko pareshaani hona laazmi he
 Buy big beds to avoid this
 2
 Use pillows: If your partner feels sleepy while sleeping and starts to jerk his hands, then it is also natural to disturb your sleep
 isse bachane ke liye aap bistar ke bich main ek takiya rakhkar soen jisase duuri barkaraar rahegi
 3
 rakhen do razaiyaan:sote samay agar aapkaa saathi razaai yaa kambal khinch letaa he or aapaki neend disturb hoti he to iskaa sabase behatar samaadhaan he ki aap do razaaiyaan yaa kambal kharid kar rakh len
 4
 hybrid bed:yah bed aisa he ki aap isaki narmi ko apane hisaab se edjust kar sakate hai
 This will not disturb your sleep at all
 isamen aapmovement bhi set kar saktehain, jisase kisi ek ke karavat lene kii halchal duusare ko pataa bhi nahin chalegi
 5
 kharraaton par lagaaein brake:lagbhag 1100 logon par kiye gaye survey main paaya gaya ki kharraaton ke chalate partner kii neend disturb hoti he or kai raaten jagakar hi bitaani padati hai
 According to doctors, avoid drinking alcohol or other such things before sleeping
 isse aapkosans lene main takalifanhin hogi or kharrate nahin aaenge
 6: Set two alarms: If a sudden phone call or your partner's alarm rings while sleeping, annoyance is sure to happen
 agar aapaki timming diferent he to alag-alag alarm set karen
 Especially use silent alarm
 yah na sirf aapako jagayegaa balki partner kii neend bhi disturb nahin hogi
 7
 sambandh na banaaen:taaja research ke mutabik, sambandh banane ke baad kapal jaldi so jate hai, khaskar purush
 Doctors believe that being so persistent will cause problems to one and cause bitterness in your relationships
 isliye neend na aane par ek duusare se baaten karnaa yaa phir koi acchhee kitaab badhanaa bhi bura idia nahin he

 salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan ke chotil hone ke baad england ke purv ballebaaj kevin petersan ne kaha he ki bharat ko vishwa cap team main yuva rishabh pant ko laana chahie
 Dhawan has a thumb injury and is therefore skeptical of playing in the World Cup
 petersan ne twit kar likhaa, 'shikhar vishwa cap se baahar ho gaye hai
 Quickly place Pant on the plane
 lokesh rahul se opening karaie or pant ko number-4 par lekar aaie
 'indian cricket team opener Shikhar Dhawan has been ruled out for 3 weeks from the ongoing World Cup in England due to a fracture in the thumb
 aisi ashanka he ki vah newjiland or pakistan ke saath hone vaale do maichon main nahin khel sakenge
 While there are discussions that Dhawan has been eliminated from the World Cup, the team management is not confident about his position and that is why he is not able to take a final decision on the name of Dhawan's option
 niyamon ke mutabik, agar kisi or khilaadi ke naam kaa elaan dhawan kii jagah kiya jaataa he to baayen haath kaa ballebaaj phir is toornament main nahin khel sakegaa
 According to the IANS agency, Dhawan's fracture has been detected through a CT scan but the X-ray does not mention any fracture
 isi kaaran dhawan aage kii jaanch ke liye leeds ravaanaa ho chuke hai
 There are reports that the team management wants to be assured about Dhawan's injury and the timing of his return before Dhawan's option is announced
 bhartiya chayankartaaon ne ambati raidu, rishabh pant, navdeep saini, eshanth sharma or akshar patel ko rigerv khilaadiyon ke taur par rakhaa he
 The team can choose any of these in place of Dhawan but Pant's name is at the forefront of Dhawan's option

 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has spoken against PM Modi
 unhone somvaar ko kaha ki janata ke paas piem modi (PM Modi) ke jhooth se bachane kaa ek hi upaay he
 And that is that the public should seal PM Modi's lips by applying leukoplast in this election
 aisa karne se piem modi jhooth nahin bol paaenge
 This statement of CM (mamata Banerjee) came after PM Modi's second visit to West Bengal
 kuchbihar kii raily main piem modi (PM Modi) ne kaha ki tha ki aaj pashchim bengal main halaat aise hai ki log didi se zyada modi-modi bol rahe hai
 And because of this the Chief Minister has lost his sleep
 nagarakata main apni raily ke dauraan mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee) ne kaha ki modi ke paas kisaanon or madhya varg kii samasyaon par dhyaan dene kaa vakt nahin tha kyonki ve apane paanch saal ke kaarykaal main saadhe chaar saal duniya hi ghoomane main vyast rahe
 Banerjee alleged that Modi is threatening everyone and telling lies when elections are approaching
 unhone daawa kiya ki agar jhooth bolne kii koi pratiyogita hui to modi ko usamen pehla puraskaar milegaa
 He said that in this election people will stick leukoplast on their lips so that they cannot lie
 desh ke khatir unhen naa keval kursi (pradhanmantri pad) balki raajnneeti se bhi baahar karnaa chahie
 Mamta Banerjee said that during the five years he roamed the world for four and a half years
 jab deshbhar main kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe the to ve kya kar rahe the? jab notebandi ke kaaran log mar rahe the or karodon logon ne apni naukariyaan ganvaai to vah kya kar rahe the? gauratlab he ki yah koi pehla mauka nahin he jab mamata banerjee ne piem modi par hamalaa bolaa he
 Earlier, he had said that he (mamata Banerjee) had called PM Modi an 'expiry babu'
 mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee)ne kaha tha ki vah expyri babu hai or unki sarkaar bhi kuch din baad expire hone vaali he
 West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on PM Modi: He is an expiry babu
 his govt has expired
 You (PM) said in Siliguri that we (TMC Govt) did not do anything for poor, what have you done in the last 5 years? Don't speak lies everyday

 com / gdsodzv8r1unhone kaha thaki piem (PM Modi) ne silligudi main kaha ki tiemasi ne koi kaam nahin kiya he, main aapse puuchhati hum ki aapane paanch saal main kya kiya he
 i tell you have just lied
 kooch bihar jile main yojit ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue mamata ne daawa kiya tha ki pashchim bengal main unki sarkaar ne logon ke liye anek kalyankari kaary kiye hai
 He had said that under his rule the income of farmers in Bengal has increased threefold
 pradhanmantri modi kaa 'expyri babu' or 'expyri piem' ke rup main majaak udaate hue mamata banerjee ne unhen tivi par yaa jansabha main khuli bahes karne kii chunauti di thi
 He had said that i am not Modi, i do not lie
 unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki pradhanmantri ne pashchim bengal main tiemasi ke kaaryon ko lekar jhooth bolaa he
 He claimed that 12,000 farmers committed suicide in the country under Modi's rule
 trinmul supremeo kaa yah palatwaar pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara silligudi or kolkata main bhaajapa kii raily ke dauraan kiye gaye hamalon ke baad aayaa tha
 Significantly, earlier, PM Modi had targeted Mamata Banerjee and called her a speed breaker
 piem modi ne kaha tha kipaschim bengal main ek speed braker he, jinako aap didi ke naam se jaanate hai
 Didi is not worried about the poor
 aakhir didi ko garibi kii raajnneeti kerani he, wo garibi khatm karne ke liye kaise kaam kar sakati hai? agar garibi hi khatm ho jaaegi, to didi kii politics khatm ho jaaegi
 PM Modi said that the chit fund scam took place in West Bengal
 mere garib bhaaiyon or bahanon kaa paisa lekar didi ke mantri, didi ke vidhayak, didi ke saathi bhaag gaye, unhone garibon ko lut liya
 Realizing the concern of the poor, the NDA government of the Center started the Ayushman Bharat scheme
 garib ko kaha tha ki beemaari kii sthiti main 5 lakh rupye tak kaa ilaaj muft hoga, aapako ek bhi rupaya aspataal main kharch nahin karnaa padegaa
 What speed breaker didi do? This scheme which benefited the poor, put a break in West Bengal
 didi ne pashchim bengal ke 70 lakh se zyada kisaan pariwaron ke vikaas par bhi brake laga diya he
 In all the states of the country, money is being transferred directly to the bank accounts of farmers under the PM Kisan Samman Yojana
 lekin didi to didi hai
 He also put a break on PM Kisan Samman Yojana in West Bengal
 idhar, pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee bhi buudhvaar kouttar bengal ke kooch bihar se apane chunavi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karengi
 Mamta's rally will be held at Dinhata in Cooch Behar
 trinmul congress netaaon ke mutabik mamata pehle 4 april ko apane abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karne vaali thi lekin baad main unhone BJP se sidhe takkar lete hue ek din pehle hi abhiyaan shuru karne kaa faisalaa kiya

 Swami Chinmayananda has clearly stated that Pravin Togadia has nothing to do with VHP anymore
 iske baad togadiya ne 14 janvari ko mumbai main hue ek kaarykram kaa nimantran patr media main bhejkar yah jataane kii koshish kii he ki ve hi vishwa hindu parishad ke adhyaksh hai
 Actually, Togadia has sent an invitation letter to the media on 14 January organized by Amrit Mahotsav Committee in Mumbai
 isamen vishisht atithi ke rup main togadiya ko vihip kaa anterrashtriya karyaadhyaksh bataaya gaya he
 Uttar Pradesh Governor Ram Naik, Sadhvi Ritambhara, Sarkaryavah Bhaiyaji Joshi of the RSS also attended the program
 is patr ke saath hi ek photo bhi bheji gai he, jisamen togadiya sadhvi rutambhraa ke bagal main baithe dikh rahe hai
 Togadia has sent this letter and photo claiming that he is the President of Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 alag-thalag pade togadiyagauratlab he ki praveen togadiya dwaara sarkaar par unke khilaaf sajeesh karne or encounter karwaane kii sajeesh rachane jaise aaropon ke baad naa keval aresas balki viechpi ne bhi puure vivaad se khud ko alag kar liya tha or ab swami chinmayanand ne kaha he ki praveen togadiya kaa philhal viechpi se koi lenadena nahin he

 bataa den ki swami chinmayanand VHP ke maardarshak mandal ke sadsy hai
 Rebel Tawark, who was shown at the VHP session, has been a long-time leader of Hindutva firebrand leader Togadia
 gujarat chunaav ke dauraan bhi bhaajapa ne hindutv chehre kii bharpai yogi adityanath se kii
 Earlier, Togadia had shown rebel attitude in the 6-day VHP session in Bhubaneswar on December 25 to 30
 tab aresas ke sarkarywah bhaiyaji joshi ne bich-bachaav kiya tha
 It was alleged that the conspiracy of the encounter was alleged that Praveen Togadia disappeared in a mysterious manner after a warrant of arrest came out from a Rajasthan court
 vah kareeb 11 ghante baad behoshee kii haalat main ahmedabad main mili the
 He was admitted to a hospital
 agle din aspataal se unhone press conference kii thi or kaha tha ki unke encounter kii sajeesh ho rahi he
 He accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Ahmedabad police of conspiring against him
 dilli kii ek adaalat ne apni patni kaa ashleel video banane or ise internet se judi sevaaon ke jariye failaane ke maamle ke 44-varshiya ek aaropee ko jamaanat de di

 adaalat ne kaha ki use jail main band rakhane se koi laabh nahin hoga
 Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Sumit Das granted relief to the Ahmedabad resident arrested on September last year

 ) Seats decided between bjp-shiv Sena in Maharashtra? Sanket Thakre said by Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's statement - Declaration to be made within two days: There is almost agreement on alliance between BJP and Shiv Sena for Maharashtra assembly elections
 kuch aise hi sanket shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne shuukravaar ko press conference main die
 He claimed that within two days an announcement would be made about the seat sharing between the two parties
 uddhav thakare ke bayaan se pataa chalata he siton ke masale par shivasena kaa rukh adiyal nahin balki naram he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray also said that seats in the alliance would be split on the same formula that was finalized during the Lok Sabha elections in a meeting with BJP President Amit Shah and CM Devendra Fadnavis
 bataa den ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main shivasena ne 23 siton par, jabaki bijepi ne 25 siten par chunaav ladaa tha
 Thus, in the Lok Sabha elections, BJP was in the role of elder brother
 jis tarah se shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne loksabhaa chunaav ke formule ke aadhaar par vidhansabha main bhi siton ke bantwaare kii baat kahi he
 This indicates that even in the assembly elections, the BJP will contest more seats while playing the role of elder brother
 haalanki shivasena purv main baraabar siton kii maang karti rahi he
 Even during the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had given two lesser seats than its own, ignoring its demand
 shivasena samajhati he gathbandhan kii takatloksabhaa chunaav main prachand bahumat or sau dinon ke bheetar modi sarkaar kii ore se liye gaye kai bade faislon ke chalate bijepi kii siyaasi sthiti majboot hui he
 Shiv Sena also understands this very well
 yahi vajah he ki vah gathbandhan main siton ke bantwaare ko lekar adiyal rukh nahin rakhana chaahati
 Because the Shiv Sena also knows that it cannot form a government on its own and it is necessary to have the support of the BJP to come to power
 sutron ke mutabik is vajah se shivasena bijepi se kam siton par bhi maanane ko taiyaar he
 Shiv Sena contested alone in 2014 elections
 283 siton par ummidavaar utaarne par sirf 63 par jeet mili thi
 At the same time, BJP had got 122 seats
 chunaav baad gathbandhan kar donon dalon ne maharashtra main sarkaar banaai thi

 nai dilli: sahitya academy ne nemichandra jain janmashtavarshiki par ek parisamvaad kaa aayojan kiya
 In this symposium, the opening statement was presented by eminent poet, playwright and critic Nandkishore Acharya
 to vahiin vishisht atithi ke taur par prakhyat nirdeshak, nrutyaangna evam vidhushi rashmi vaajapeyi thi
 The seed statement was given by noted critic Jyotish Joshi and the Presidential statement was given by Madhav Kaushik, Vice President of Sahitya Akademi
 swaagat vaktavy dete hue sahitya academy ke sachiv ke shrinivasrav ne kaha ki rachanaakaar sirf apni rachanaaon se hi bada nahin banataa he, balki usne sahitya main kitne nae rachanakaaron ko sthaan diya, unhen prabhavit kiya or aage badhaayaa, isse bhi vah pahachaanaa or yaad kiya jaataa he
 Respected Nemichandra Jain was one such creator
 jain ne bahut saare nae rachanakaaron ko ek nai drushti di or unhen sanskaarit kiya
 In his inaugural statement Nandkishore Acharya said that Nemichandra Jain has viewed the tradition from a critical point of view and inaugurated the new truth
 ve hameshaa aisi naveenta kii talash main rahe jo manushya main naitikta kaa bodh laati he
 He was a critical critic in a way
 hindi aalochana ne unke sahitya-chintan or vyaavhaarik aalochana par thik tarah se dhyaan nahin diya he
 And this is unheard of of his talent
 unki kavitaaon ko lekar or kaam kiye jane kii jarurat he
 As a special guest, Padhari Rashmi Vajpayee recalled her entire life, giving many examples of her generosity, saying that she was a strong advocate for women's freedom as a husband and a father
 unhone vivaah ke baad na keval apni patni ko shikshit kiya balki vibhinn kala madhyamon main kaary karne kii chhot bhi di
 He did the same for us sisters
 unhone yuvaaon main vishesh ruchi kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki ve saanskrithik samaj ko aane vaali pidiyon tak pahunchaana chaahate the
 While giving the seed statement, noted critic Jyotish Joshi said that Nemichandra Jain was a rare person in all respects
 hindi sahitya ke sabhi kshetron main unka kaam smaraneey rahegaa
 Describing Kavita as the key to her personality, Joshi said that with this we can understand them better
 unke karyaan kii samyak vivechna karnaa aavashyak he
 As a critic, he is a 'civilizational critic' who leaves no aspect of culture untouched
 ve bhartiya rangakarm ko abhinay kendrit bananaa chaahate the jo ki mukhyata nirdeshak kendrit he
 He commented strongly on Hindi critics, saying that he had shown a lot of flair with Nemichandra Jain
 aage unhone kaha ki nemichandra jain kii kavita ko satarkta ke saath dekhne kii jarurat he
 He did a great job of modeling the story, reviewing the novel
 unke kaaryon kii vivechna karnaa bahut zaruri he
 In his presidential statement, Madhav Kaushik said that due to literary parochialism, we have not evaluated Nemichandra properly, which is very much needed today
 pratham satr jo natyalochan or samskruti vimarsh par tha kii adhyakshata devendraraj ankur ne kii or hrushikesh sulabh, kirti jain evam suman kumaar ne apane aalekh prastut kiye
 In the context of theatrical criticism of Nemichandra Jain, first Kirti Jain said that in the development of Hindi theater, he held the feudalistic thinking of the Hindi state responsible
 unka maananaa tha ki rangamanch koi shastreey vidha nahin he jisamen ki badlaav na kiye ja sake
 The theater should be constantly communicating with its audience
 nemichandra jain natya aalochakon se yah ummid kar rahe the ki ve naatak ke zaruri or gaiyr zaruri tattvon kii taraf gambhirtha se dhyaan den
 Hrishikesh Sulabh said that he was worried about the cultural discourse being politically motivated
 ve is baat par vishwaas karte the ki naatak keval dizin nahin balki sabhi kalaon kaa mishran hai
 He emphasized that Nemichandra Jain designed the natural language of theatrical criticism
 ve hindi rangamanch kii bauddhik kshamta ko badhanaa chaahate the
 Suman Kumar said that Nemichandra Jain gave the young color workers the discretion to see and examine the different styles of plays
 satr ke adhyaksh devendraraj ankur ne kaha ki natya aalochana kii sthiti abhi bhi bahut gambhir he or use jaanchane parakhane ke liye ham abhi bhi koi samgr drushti viksit nahin kar paae hai
 He said that Nemichandra Jain always insisted that the review of the play should not only assess the superiority of one side, but should look at all the areas in a proper way
 aglaa satr unke kavyavdaan or kawychintan par kendrit tha jisaki adhyakshata nandakishor acharya ne kii or dhurav shukla evam om nishchal ne apane aalekh prastut kiye
 Om Nischal, while marking the poetic world of Nemichandra Jain, said that his solitude was not 'escapist solitude' but a vision of looking at society with his own
 nemichandra jain kii aantarikta hi unka vaishshtyi he
 Nemichandra Jain's poet is a wonderful mixture of sankochi and poetry-restraint
 dhurav shukla ne unki kavita ke bare main kaha ki kavita main unki saadagi alag se pahachaani ja sakati he
 They stand with them, drawing inspiration from their contemporary poets and set a new example of companionship and companionship
 satr ke adhyaksh nandakishor acharya ne kavita ko unki sabase priy vidha maanate hue kaha ki unhone kavita main ahm kaa vilyan or uskaa samajikaran bahut santulit rup main kiya
 We need to understand his poetry in historical perspective
 antim satr kathalochan or saakshaatkaar kaa tha jisaki adhyakshata rohinee agarwal ne kii or satyadev treepathi, prabhaat ranjan evam pallav ne apane aalekh prastut kiye
 Pallava said in his article that Nemichandra Jain, in his book 'adhure Interview', is never overwhelmed by any novelist or novel, playing the true religion of the critic but criticizing him as a whole
 vah upanyaas ko parakhane ke liye pramanikta, sookshmata or gaharaai kaa jo sutara dete hai vah aaj bhi kaaljayi he
 Prabhat Ranjan said that in his book, he gives such sources of criticism which gives a new vision to the next generation to read the novel
 satyadev treepathi ne kaha ki inaki aalochana kii yah vishistataa he ki vah katha samiksha main apane naatak ke sameekshak ko nahin aane dete hai
 He always reviews through Kriti and in reviewing 'sloppy Aanchal', it is revealed that earlier our society was governed by spirituality and righteousness
 wo ab raajnneeti se sanchalit hone laga he
 Rohini Aggarwal said in her presidential statement that he bypasses the author in his criticism and communicates the composition and brings out the simplest things hidden under the floor

 inhone hi aaj chif justise deepak mishra ke khilaaf media ke saamne aae 4 vakeelon ke group kii aguwai kii thi
 With this, he brought out the biggest differences in his advocacy career in an unprecedented way
 justise ranjan gogoi, justise madan lokur or justise courian joseph ke saath milakar unhone media ke saamne kaha ki supreme court main sab thik nahin he
 Chelameswar said that he does not want to hear after 20 years that these four judges had sold their souls
 bahut kuch jo vaanchit nahin tha, vah pichley kuch maheenon main ghatit hua he
 Along with this, he made many allegations against Chief Justice Mishra
 iske saath hi unhone vah letters bhi saarvajanik kiya jisamen unhone kaha tha ki keson ko unki yogyata ke anusaar nahin deal kiya gaya
 Four judges, including Justice Chelameswar, have written in the letter that it is important that the cases in the roster be given the right bench according to their merit, which will meet the level of required members and their number
 justise chelmeshwar sahit 4 jajon ne aarope lagaaya ki haal ke dinon main in niyamon kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya
 Many important cases, which could have far-reaching effects on the country and the Supreme Court itself, were given by the Chief Justice to their favorite beaches
 isamen tarksangat tarika nahin apanaaya gaya
 However, this is not the first time that Justice Jasti Chelameswar has expressed his differences
 isse pehle bhi vah kai maamalon main apni alag raay bebaaki se rakh chuke hai
 The Supreme Court lawyer Atul Kumar, who is from Bekaki, said that Justice Jasti Chelameswar is very vocal about his views and decisions in the Supreme Court
 jab pranab mukherjee ke raashtrapati banane ke khilaaf pie sangama ne pitishan daakhil kiya tha or use tatkaaleen chif justise altamas kabir kii adhyakshata vaali bench ne khaarij kar diya tha, tab bhi justise jasti chelmeshwar us faisle ke khilaaf khadey hone vaale jaj the
 In that judgment, the opinion of 2 contesting 3 judges played a part in rejecting the petition and the then Chief Justice Altamas Kabir was successful in giving the verdict at the last moment
 is maamle main justise jasti chelmeshwar ke saath justise ranjan gogoi bhi faisle ke khilaaf the
 Opposing the decision, he had assumed that Pranab Mukherjee retained the post of profit while filing nomination for the post of President
 NJAC kesashuukravaar se pehle jis bade cese main justise chelmeshwar ne apana matbhed dikhaaya tha, vah cese judaa tha neshnal judicial appointment kamishan act se
 The National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, which came into force with the 99th change of the Constitution, gave power to politicians and civil society in the matter of appointment of judges in the Supreme Court and High Court
 is NJAC act ko supreme court kii paanch sadasyeey bench ne 2015 main radd kar diya
 Let me tell you that even in that decision of the Constitutional Bench, only Justice Chelameswar opposed the cancellation of the Act
 ulat faisla likhte hue unhone act ko barkaraar rakhaa tha or kaha tha ki unka maananaa he ki colegium kii pratha puri tarah se apaardarshee he or ek do maamalon ko chhodkar yah aam janata or itihaas donon ke liye pahunch se baahar he
 Supreme Court lawyer Atul Kumar said that Justice Chelameswar did not attend the Collegium meetings when TS Thakur was the Chief Justice
 justise chelmeshwar ne un filon par tabhi dastakhat kiye jab vah colegium dwaara unke paas bheje jate the
 MCI Case In the MCI case, the judges were accused of taking bribe
 is cese main bhi justise chelmeshwar baaki anya jajon se alag raay di thi
 In this case, he was found to be face to face with the Chief Justice on the administrative matters of the Supreme Court
 pichley saal november main is pitishan par sunwaayee karte hue justise chelmeshwar ne aadesh diya ki is maamle main SIT gathit ho yaa nahin, is baat par vichaar karne ke liye paanch sadasyeey sanvaidhanik bench kaa nirmaan ho
 However, by the time Justice Chelameswar could write his order in this case, the order to transfer the case to another bench reached his table 
 yah aadesh sidhechif justise deepak mishrake paas se aayaa tha
 Justice Chelameswar, while attaching that draft order, wrote that the order to make a constitutional bench can also be given in the absence of the Chief Justice
 supreme court ke vakil atul kumaar ne bataaya ki yah supreme court ke sthapit niyamon ke khilaaf tha
 Chief Justice Mishra set up a separate 7-member constitutional bench to review Justice Chelameswar's order in the case
 is bench main 2 jajon ko ayogy tehra diya gaya, vahiin chif justise mishra samet paanch jajon ne justise chelmeshwar ke aadesh ko radd kar diya
 Justice Jasti Chelameswar himself has been harassed by the Collegium? On 20 October 2011, he was made a judge of the Supreme Court
 unka sarvocch adaalat main pahunchane kaa yah faisla deree se aana vaala mana jaataa he, kyonki vah may 2007 se march 2010 tak gohati hoicourt main chif justise rah chuke the
 At the same time, before being appointed a judge in the Supreme Court, he was sent as the Chief Justice of the Kerala High Court
 iske saath hi jis supreme court colegium ne justise jasti chelmeshwar ko supreme court kaa jaj banaaya, usne hi justise deepak mishra ko supreme court kaa jaj banaaya
 However, Mishra was given seniority in the listing, from which Justice Jasti Chelameswar lost the chance of becoming Chief Justice
 justise jasti chelmeshwar jahaan june main ritair kar jaaenge, vahiin chif justise mishra oktober main ritair honge
 There has been a discussion in the legal circle that Justice Galle Chelameswar has been a victim of the Collegium system
 is kaaran hi justise jasti chelmeshwar is pratha main paardarshita kii vakaalat karne vaale sabase bade yoddha hai
 Many believe that the reason for the Supreme Court's decision to go online about the collegium is also due to Justice Jasti Chelameswar, who has openly criticized the 23-year-old practice
 vahiin chif justise ko likhe apane letters main bhi chaaron jajon ne kuch naamon kaa virodh kiya he, jinhen supreme court kaa jaj banane ke liye clear kiya gaya he
 After the cancellation of NJAC, the Supreme Court is in the process of creating a Memorandum of Procedure for appointment of judges

 input: bhashaa It was talked about when Nitin Gadkari was the President of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and he was almost certain to become the President again
 
 
 party mahasachiv ravishankar prasad ko eses ahaluwalia ke baad rajyasabha main upanetaa bana diya gaya tha
 
 
 On the basis of the one-man-one-post theory, he left the post of general secretary and there was speculation about new general secretary coming in his place in Gadkari's team
 
 
 bahut kuredne par pataa chalaa ki gadakari kii team main aane vaale nae mahasachiv honge amit shah
 
 
 However, this did not happen then
 
 
 janvari, 2013 main gadakari phir adhyaksh nahin ban sake
 
 
 Rajnath Singh took charge of the party
 
 
 amit shah ko mahasachiv banaaya gaya or uttar pradesh kii jimmedaari di gai
 
 
 With this, it was decided that in the Lok Sabha elections 2014, Narendra Modi will not only be the bjp's prime ministerial candidate, but will also contest from Uttar Pradesh
 
 
 bhaajapa ke liye 15 saal se banjar padi uttar pradesh kii dharti par camel khilaanaa aasaan kaam nahin he
 
 
 Especially not for a person who has never worked outside Gujarat
 
 
 gujarat ke pichley teen vidhansabha chunaavon main amit shah ne bataur ranneetikaar apni chhap chodi he, or rajya main ummidavaaron ke chayan se lekar mudde tay karne tak sab main shah kii badi bhoomika rahi he
 
 
 According to the Supreme Court order in Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, when he was asked to stay away from Gujarat, he used it to prepare land for Modi by staying in Delhi
 
 
 amit shah ab pichley 10 maheenon se uttar pradesh main lage hue hai
 
 
 Today, opinion polls are predicting that in the Lok Sabha elections 2014, BJP can win at least 40 seats in Uttar Pradesh
 
 
 aisa hota he yaa nahin, yah kah paanaa abhi mushkil he, lekin yah tay he ki amit shah ke uttar pradesh jane ke baad vahaan narendra modi ke paksh main alag tarah kaa maahaul bananaa zarur shuru hua he
 
 
 After becoming in charge of UP, Amit Shah started a tour of the state
 
 
 vah sabhi 62 jilon main ja chuke hai
 
 
 During these visits, Shah started meeting the workers and leaders in person
 
 
 shah raat ko kisi hotel yaa guestaouse main rukne ke bajaae kaaryakartaaon ke gharon main hi rukate the
 
 
 In this way they established dialogue at the ground level
 
 
 booth str par kaaryakartaaon kii team khadi kii
 
 
 He exhorted the leaders and activists to take the name of Narendra Modi from door to door
 
 
 vah yah kehete rahe ki loksabhaa chunaav 2014 narendra modi ke naam par hi ladaa jayega
 
 
 Took everyone together to make Modi's rallies a success
 
 
 nateeja yah rahaa ki uttar pradesh main modi kii har raily pichhali raily se badi hui
 
 
 But due to delay in selection of candidates and incorrect selection of some candidates, Shah's decisions have started to be questioned
 
 
 jagdambika paal ko congress se laakar dumriyaganj se, espi singh baghel ko bispi se laakar firozabad se or dharmendra kushvaha ko samaajawaadee party se laakar aanwala se tikat dena sthaneey kaaryakartaaon ko raas nahin aa rahaa he
 
 
 In Bijnor, the candidate has to change at the last moment
 
 
 kai siton par ummidavaaron ke khilaaf pradarshan hue hai or kai bade netaaon ne munh phula liya he
 
 
 It has also been said that Amit Shah could not run in front of party president Rajnath Singh in ticket distribution
 
 
 lekin shah ke karibiyon kaa kahana he ki tikat baantne main jaanboojhkar deree kii gai, taaki zyaada asantosh na bhadke
 
 
 After a long time in the state, there is an atmosphere in favor of BJP and many leaders want that they get a chance to contest elections
 
 
 amit shah kehete hai ki sapa-basapa kai saal pehle apane ummidavaar ghoshit kar dete hai, lekin ain vakt par badal bhi dete hai
 
 
 BJP and Congress cannot do this, so delay in tickets is natural
 
 
 baahar se ummidavaar laane ke sawaal par amit shah kehete hai ki yah sankhya zyada nahin he, or aise hi logon ko praathamikta di gai he, jo vivaadit nahin hai or apni siton par jeet sakate hai
 
 
 The biggest bet for Amit Shah is to field Narendra Modi from Banaras (varanasi)
 
 
 purvanchal main post padi bhaajapa ko isse nai jaan milane kii sambhaavna he
 
 
 BJP is eyeing 27 seats in the area
 
 
 party kii koshish modi kii ummidavaari se bihar tak phayda uthaane kii he
 
 
 Fighting Modi with Benares is also a message to the Hindutva supporters
 
 
 modi ne apni reliyon main ek baar bhi ramamandir kaa zikr nahin kiya he
 
 
 Amit Shah definitely went to Ayodhya and talked about building Ram temple there, but since then he has not talked about Ram temple even once
 
 
 narendra modi ke liye vyaktigat taur par uttar pradesh behad mahatvapurn he
 
 
 He knows that his dream of becoming Prime Minister can be fulfilled only when the party gets success from UP in the '90s in Lok Sabha elections 2014
 
 
 isiilie unhone apane behad kareebi amit shah ko rajya kii jimmedaari di he
 
 
 If success is found here, Shah will ensure his place in the party for the future

 At a rally in Delhi on Wednesday, the Prime Minister alleged that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, along with the family, used warship INS Virat to celebrate the holiday 30 years ago

 While the Prime Minister's charge was dismissed by the former Naval Chief Ramdas, also the then Admiral and Vice Admiral
 dilli main pradhanmantri modi ke is aarope ke baad bijepi or congress main talavaarein khinch gai hai
 Congress spokesperson Pawan Kheda on Thursday called PM Modi a serial liar
 jabaki bijepi pravaktaa shahanwaaz hossain ne piem ke bayaan par congress se spashtikaran maanga
 In the midst of the controversy, JDU, a constituent of the NDA, described Rajiv Gandhi as a martyr
 party ke pradhan mahasachiv kasee tyaagi ne enditivi se kaha, "piem ke paas kai tarah kii khufia jaankaree hoti he or saarvajanik taur par jo jaankaree unhone share kii he us par aapatti uthaane kaa yaa asahmati vyakt karne kaa prashn hi khadaa nahin hota he
 But as far as his murder is concerned, he is murdered by LTTE
 or wo is kaary ke liye shahid hue the, ye kehane main hamen sankoch nahin he
 "by the sixth phase of the Lok Sabha elections, the congress-bjp is getting entangled in the allegations and counter-allegations about the leader who had passed away 28 years ago
 
 
 mushkil ye he ki isaki vajah se aam logon se jude mudde peeche chhutate ja rahe hai
 In the midst of this political debate, former Navy Chief Retired Admiral L
 Ramadoss flatly rejected Prime Minister Modi's claim
 ek patr jari karte hue enditivi se unhone kaha INS viraat se rajeev gandhi lakshadweep ke sarkari daure par aae the
 He was accompanied by his wife, no foreign guests
 unke kisi paariwarik kaaran se INS viraat ko kahin bheja nahin gaya tha

 He said that the crude oil is stored in the pump and it is sent for treatment through pipes
 pipe main aag lagane se tanks main visphot ho gaya
 On the other hand, the anti-talk faction of United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) has claimed responsibility for the blast and said that the attack is a part of the campaign being run by the organization against the exploitation policy of the central government
 sanghathan bade pratishthanon par hamale kaa abhiyaan chalaa rahaa he
 Police officials, however, said the blast was caused by a technical glitch and that the ulfa's anti-negotiating group was not involved

 The date of 23 April in the IPL is very strange for Virat Kohli-led team Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB)
 yah taarikh aaarasibi ke liye aisi he ki vah ise yaad bhi karnaa chaahati he or har haar main bhoolanaa bhi chaahati he
 On 23 April, RCB has seen the best days in IPL and also the worst

 a batsman will have to show a bang to reach here
 iske alaava divilliars ne 12 gendon main 31 ran or dilashaan ne gail ke saath khelte hue 33 ran 36 gendon main banaaye the
 In this match, the record of most sixes and the fastest century of T20 was also made

 Also, by asking five questions, an attempt has been made to make Rahul intellectually weak

 Now Rahul is on state visit once again on Thursday and the BJP has again asked questions to Shehzade

 In this advertisement, the BJP has also questioned Rahul's intellectual ability and said that the last 10 questions were difficult, you could not answer them, so this time five supplementary questions are being asked

 Apart from this, four 'life lines' have also been given
 bhaajapa ne is vigyaapan ke jariye poocha he- "aapaki daadi ke naare 'garibi hataao' ke 42 saal baad bhi desh se garibi kyon nahin hati? kya aap ise congress kii asaf lata maanate hai? paanch saal pehle jis kalavati ke yahaan aapane roti khai thi, kya aapako us garib mahila ke parivaar kii sthiti kaa pataa he?" iske alaava rabart wadra bhoomi vivaad, koyala ghotaale main pradhanmantri kii bhoomika or khadyann suraksha par sawaal puche gaye hai

 As the Chief Minister of BS Yeddyurappa, how the Reddy Brothers dominated the politics of Karnataka at any time is not hidden from anyone
 phir halaat badale
 The Supreme Court prohibited former Minister g Janardhana Reddy from entering Bellary after the Rs 16,500 crore mining scam was exposed
 janardan reddy ko 43 maheene jail main bhi bitaane pade
 Neither Yeddyurappa was with the BJP nor the Reddy Brothers or those close to him during the 2013 Karnataka assembly elections
 ab ek baar phir halaat badal chuke hai
 While Yeddyurappa is the face of the Chief Minister from the BJP, the party is playing a big bet on the Reddy Brothers in Bellary and the surrounding area
 reddy bhaaiyon main somashekhar reddy or karunaakar reddy ko bijepi ne tikat diya he
 At the same time, many other people of Janardhana Reddy including Sriramulu have also been awarded the ticket by the party
 bijepi ke liye jahaan reddy bros kaa saath lenaa majaburi he vahiin janardan reddy bhi gadgad hai
 This is the reason why Janardan is not tired of reading ballads in the pride of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP
 ‘ajtak’ ke saath khaas baatcheet main janardan reddy ne is baar karnataka main bijepi ke purna bahumat ke saath satta main aane kaa bharosa jataayaa
 While Janardhana Reddy told BJP in his blood, he also said that people are with BJP and Prime Minister Modi, people believe that God has sent Modi and they are good for him
 janardan reddy ne bellari se 50 kilometre dur molaclamru gaanv main deraa daal kar aasapaas kii sabhi siton ke liye bijepi ke prachaar kii kaman sanbhale hue hai
 Talking to 'aaj Tak' in this village, he said, 'there was a lot of development in the previous BJP government
 log us sarkaar ko yaad karte hai
 People have received a lot of frustration from the Siddaramaiah government
 ’janardan reddy ye yaad karana bhi nahin bhoolatey ki ‘bellari bijepi kaa majboot garh he, 2004 se lagaataar teen baar party bellari main jitati aa rahi he
 We have been winning panchayat elections for 15 years
 bijepi bellari jile main bahut majboot he
 It is not necessary for me to go to the area and campaign
 yahaan log bijepi ke saath hai or ham bade antar se jeet hasil karne ja rahe hai
 Janardhana Reddy denied that he was controlling 6 districts for the party
 unhone saath hi joda, ‘party ke hit main jahaan bhi jaruri samajha jayega, vahaan kaam karne jaaoongaa
 Denying all the allegations against him, Janardhana Reddy said that whatever disputes are there, he has raised the standing of the Congress
 janardan ke mutabik kareeb 90 fisadi mudde sulajh jhuke hai bas kuch hi baaki hai, kanoon apana kaam karegaa, aakhirkaar insaaf hoga
 Janardhana Reddy said, 'there are only allegations and no evidence
 hamaare parivaar ke khilaaf ek chota chota saboot bhi nahin
 You can see the love of people for our family itself
 congress hamaare parivaar kaa saamana nahin kar sakati kyonki wo jaanati he kitne log hamaare saath hai
 Janardhana Reddy said, "the Congress fabricated all these things in the media under propaganda against us
" jab unhone mujhe jail main 43 maheene rakhaa kya ek rupaya bhi mujhase jabt kar sake
 They just want to make false accusations so that i stay in jail
 aisa unhone kiya
 But we have done nothing wrong, people know everything
 sab kuch court main hai or court sabooton se chalegaa, kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 On the charge of spending wild money during marriage at home, Janardhana Reddy also described it as a media product
 janardan reddy ne kaha ki unhone inakam tex vibhaag ko sari suchanaaen di, wo kharch kii pai-pai kii detail jaanate hai
 Perhaps the country's earliest scam secrets have been locked in the shelves of South Block for the past half-century and have been locked by government secrecy laws

 The confidential "netaji Files" in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and the Ministry of External Affairs contain information about the "treasury of Azad Hind Fauj"
 ye barason kii gopneey reportein, chitthiyaan or telegram hai
 These include the story of greed and opportunism of some Indian freedom fighters who looted the treasury of the temporary government of Azad Hind
 yah sandigdh lut 1945 main vimaan durghatana main netaji kii mrity ke fouran baad hui thi
 But today the shocking twist in the story is not the disappearance of Azad Hind Army's treasure of hundreds of crores of rupees
 ascharyajanak yah he ki us vakt kii sarkaar is bare main jaanati thi, lekin usne kiya kuch nahin
 Confidential documents found to India Today reveal that the Nehru government ignored repeated warnings of the three heads of the Tokyo embassy between 1947 and 1953

 Sathe wrote that the treasure had been vanished by suspected conspirators
 in sabhi chetavaniyon ko andekha kar diya gaya
 No investigation was conducted
 isse bhi badtar yah ki aaazaad hind fouj ke jis shaks par in rajanyikon ko gaban main shaamil hone kaa shaq tha, use shandaar sarkari pad se nawaja gaya
 These explosive revelations are locked in 37 files that the PMO has been refusing to remove from the privacy list for more than a decade
 sarkaar kii daleel rahi he ki inhen gopneeyata suchi se hataanaa janhit main nahin he
 But this argument is no longer credible: the secrecy papers kept in the National Archives show that the Nehru government had spied the Bose family and that spying lasted for two decades from 1947 to 1968
 india today ke is jasusi ke khulaase ke teen din baad 13 april ko netaji ke bhai ke padpote suryakumar bose berlin main pradhanmantri narendra modi se mili the
 The family's anger has now been replaced by this firm demand that the curtain of secrecy be removed from over 150 "netaji Files" locked in the basement of the government
 9 may ko pradhanmantri ne bose parivaar ke sadasyon ko in filon ko gopneeyata suchi se hataane kaa bharosa dilaayaa tha
 Modi told family members in Kolkata, "don't call it a demand of the people, it is the responsibility of the nation
" ” lekin ye gaiyr-maamuli khulaase, jinamein kuch kaa zikr lekhak anuj dhar kii kitaab indiaj biguest cover-ap main bhi hua he, bataate hai ki sarkaar ke paas chhipaane ke liye bahut kuch tha
 On January 29, 1945, the treasury of the Azad Hind Fauj, the Indians living in Rangoon, the capital of Burma, Japan, were celebrating for a week
 yah aaazaad hind kii asthaayee sarkaar ke mukhiya netaji kaa 48waan janmdin tha

 But by 1945, it was of no use as the Japanese troops and the Azad Hind Fauj dispersed in front of the rising Allied forces in Burma

 Netaji withdrew from the fighting on April 24, 1945 and came to Bangkok and brought with him the treasury of the Provisional Government
 ve apane saath kitna sona laae, is bare main alag-alag byore hai
 Immediately after the fight, the British intelligence agency questioned Dinanath, the chairman of Azad Hind Bank, and he told that Netaji 63

 Debnath Das, the head of the Indian Independence League (IIL) in Bangkok, told the Shahnawaz Commission in 1956 that Netaji had paid Rs 1 crore
 mulya kaa khajaana, jo zyaadaatar sone ke gahanon or silliyon ke rup main tha, 17 chote silband baxon main nikaala tha

 Japanese military personnel stationed at the airport collected the remaining 11 kg of gold from the treasure, sealed it in petrol boxes and sent it to the headquarters of the Imperial Japanese Army in Tokyo
 ek duusare bakse main netaji ke sharir ke avshesh rakhe gaye or taiwan ke sthaneey shavadahgrih main antim sanskaar kiya gaya
 Where did the rest of Netaji's war fund go? It seems incredible that 63

 In the uproar of defeat, it was difficult to find the right figures

 The Indian government became interested in the INA treasury four years later in May 1951, when an exceptionally stubborn diplomat

 Chettur went to Tokyo to become the head of the Indian Liao Mission
 bharat ne us vakt tak japan ke saath purna rajanyik sambandh sthapit nahin kiye the
 Chettur described Iyer's return with disappointment

 Seven years later, Iyer was now on his way back to Tokyo
 unhone daawa kiya ki ve chhuttiyaan manaane ja rahe the, jabaki asal main ek gupt kaam se ja rahe the
 In the exchange of telegrams with the Foreign Office of New Delhi, Chettur first used the term "INA Treasure", which has since been used regularly in government papers
 ayyar ne tokyo main chettur se kaha ki bharat sarkaar ne unhen doharaa kaam saunpa he&yah tasdik karnaa ki rankoji mandir main rakhi gai asthiyaan netaji kii hai or durghatnagrast vimaan se praapt kiye gaye sone ke jewaron ko waapas hasil karnaa
 In a confidential letter to the Ministry of External Affairs, Chettur wrote that "the local Hindustani have been boiling with anger over Iyer's return and his relationship with these two brothers (murthy)", because "ramamurthy and Iyer were assembled of Netaji The mysterious disappearance of gold and jewelry is definitely related to something
 ”lekin ayyar pehle hi ek haroonges karnama kar chuke the

 aktubar, 1951 main bhartiya duutavas ne iene khajaane kaa bachaa hua hissaa ramamurti ke ghar se baraamad kar liya
 Ambassador Chettur still did not trust the story of iyer-ramamurthy

 Chettur believed that Iyer had come to Tokyo in the hope of early completion of the peace treaty in 1945 to "distribute the spoils and distribute a small part of it to the government, burdening himself and Mr
 Ramamurthy's conscience
" Free of charge
 is ummid main ki aisa karke vah jaanch ko bhul-bhulaiya main daalane main kaamyaab ho jaaenge
 In his last message to New Delhi on June 22, 1951, Chettur offered to investigate the disappearance of "netaji's stored things"

 ramamurti se bhartiya adhikariyon ne kai baar poochtacha kii, lekin unhone khajaane kii baat se saaf inkaar kiya
 According to Sathe, Iyer's activities in Japan were questionable
 unhone likhaa, “jo baat or bhi zyada ahm he, vah yah ki khajaane kaa bada hissaa sagon main chhod diya gaya
 On the basis of available information, it is very important that on 26 January 1945, Netaji's stored items were weighing more than his own weight
 ” saathe ne sagon se tokyo tak ayyar kii gatividhiyon par ungali uthaai or ek chashmadid gavaah kaa zikr kiya, jisane unke kamare main bakse dekhne kaa daawa kiya tha

 Ramamurthy's close association with British intelligence officer Lieutenant Colonel Figes
 figes ab tokyo main general duglas macarthar ke adhigrahan mukhyalay main british liaajon afasar ke taur par tainaat the
 After all, what was the reason that led to such a deep nexus between Colonel Figes and his then INA enemy? There was also a speculation in Sathe's letter
 unhone likhaa, “khajaane ko galat dhang se hadap liye jane kaa shaq 1946 main ramamurti kii amiri se or bhi gaharaa ho jaataa he, jab japan ke duusare tamaam bhartiya naagarik baari museebaton se guzar rahe the
 Another truth, which indicates the misappropriation of the treasury, is the sudden emergence of military attache Colonel Figes in the British mission of Tokyo as an expert on oriental artefacts of the east and according to the information, Colonel's Ramamurthy to Britain Invitation to settle in

 The court also expressed displeasure over how you can give it to the media till such time a hearing is held in such sensitive cases

 sp's Shahid Siddiqui said that coming with him would not yield any result, while the Congress said that repeated attacks on democratic institutions in this way is not good for the nation
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh par hamalaa karte hue baba ramdev ne kaha, "pradhanmantri kehete hai ki 'main eemaandaar hum', lekin desh aapako ek vyakti ke rup main nahin dekhtaa
 "he said," The country respects you to be honest personally, but you must also be politically honest
 desh aapako sabase oonche sanvaidhanik pad par asin vyakti ke rup main dekhtaa he
 Your personal honesty is not enough
 
 Keep your cabinet honest too
 " After this, Kejriwal intensified the attack on the politicians and said in his address that the Lokpal Bill cannot be passed unless Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav, a in the Parliament
 raja or suresh kalmadi jaise saansad maujuud hai
 Attacking the Prime Minister directly, he said that between 2006 and 2009 when he had charge of the Ministry of Coal, coal blocks were allocated to underwear makers, cassette makers and gutka makers
 kejariwal ke bhaashan samaapt karne ke turant baad baba ramdev ne is par aapatti jataai or kaha, "aaj hamane sochaa tha ki ham kisi kaa naam nahin lenge lekin arvind bhai ne pravaah main naam le hi liya
 This will cause unnecessary controversy
 " Soon after he publicly objected to his speech, Kejriwal left the fast
 baad main haalanki unhone microbloging site par likhaa ki vah isliye chale aae, kyonki vah acha nahin mahasoos kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, SP leader Shahid Siddiqui said that Anna Hazare and Ramdev came together because they needed each other's support, but no result would come with them

 Union Minister of State for Agriculture Harish Rawat said that activists are hurting democratic institutions in the name of fighting corruption
 unhone kaha, "bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ke naam par ve sabhi sansthaaon ko barbaad kar dena chaahate hai
 This will not be acceptable

 Arvind Kejriwal, an important member of Team Anna, hurt by Baba Ramdev's advice, left the hunger strike
 kejariwal ne apane bhaashan main kai saansadon ke naam liye, jisapar baba ramdev ne aapatti jataai
 He said that his intention was to attack the government without naming anyone because taking names creates controversy
 jantar-mantar par hajaaron kii bheed ko sambodhit karte hue baba ramdev ne doharaaya ki sarkaar videshi bainkon main jamaa paisa waapas desh laae
 Attacking the Prime Minister directly, he said that he may be honest personally, but he should also ensure the honesty of his cabinet
 unhone kaha ki vah nau agast ko phir dilli aaenge or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf vyapak andolan kaa sutarapaatr karenge
 At the same time, Samajwadi Party (SP) and Congress criticized the joint fast
 sapa ke shahid siddiki ne kaha ki unke saath aane se koi parinaam saamne nahin aayega, jabaki congress ne kaha ki is tarah baar-baar loktantric sansthaaon par hamalaa raashtra ke liye acha nahin he
 Attacking Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Baba Ramdev said, "the Prime Minister says 'I am honest', but the country does not see you as a person
" " unhone kaha, "desh vyaktigat rup se aapke eemaandaar hone kaa sammaan karata he, lekin aapako raajnneetik rup se bhi eemaandaar hona chahie
 The country sees you as the highest constitutional post
 aapaki vyaktigat eemaandaaree kaaphi nahin he
 
 apane mantrimandal ko bhi eemaandaar rakhen
 " iske baad kejariwal ne rajanetaaon par hamalaa tej karte hue apane sambodhan main kaha ki lokapal vidheyak tab tak paarit nahin ho saktaa, jab tak ki sansad main lalu prasad, mulaayam singh yadav, e
 mps like Raja and Suresh Kalmadi are present
 unhone pradhanmantri par sidhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha ki varsh 2006 se 2009 ke bich jab unke paas koyala mantralay kaa prabhaar tha, koyala blokon kaa aavanton undervier banane waalon, casette banane waalon or gutka banane waalon ko kiya gaya
 Soon after concluding Kejriwal's speech, Baba Ramdev objected to this and said, "today we thought that we would not name anyone but Arvind Bhai took the name in the flow 
 isse anaavashyak vivaad paidaa hoga

 udhar, kai din se unke apane ghar ko bhi todakar market banane kii khabaren bhi garm hai
 Actually, the whole dispute is between the sons of Ustad Bismillah Khan
 kuch bhaaiyon kaa kahana he ki makaan jarjar ho gaya he, or sarkaar katai dhyaan nahin de rahi he, so, lihaaja ham log ise todakar neeche katra banaaenge or upar ek nae haul main ustad kii dharoharon ko sanjoenge

 hamane police ko khabar nahin kii he, kyonki yah parivaar kaa maamla he, lekin ab pataa kar rahe hai
 
 
 " darasal, yah puraa maamla ustad ke makaan ko lekar shuru hua tha
 Previously the whole family lived together, but now some brothers live separately
 unke bade bete mehataab abhi bhi is makaan main hai, or yah makaan unheen ke naam bhi he

 If it is not made, it can fall anytime and cause an accident
 
 
 jitani khan sahib kii dharohar hai, unhen upar haul main sajaa denge
 
 
 Because neither is the government making this house nor anyone else
 
 
 " On the other hand, when Ustad's second son Nayyar Hussain, who has been put out, was taken out with the intention of breaking down the legacy of the old house and building the market, it was found that Ustad's shehnai was missing
 isi ke baad duusare bhaaiyon kaa virodh jor pakad gaya

 yaheen se unhone shehanai kii shuruyaat kii thi

 " On this issue, Ustad's youngest son Nazim Hussain said, "we are sorry that the name Khan Saheb did in the world will break
" 
 
 sari nishaniyaan khatm ho jaaengi
 
 
 After 50-60 years from today, when children will come and ask where Khan Saheb used to live, what will we answer? 
 
 " It is noteworthy that Ustad Bismillah Khan left behind five sons and three daughters, the eldest of them, Mahtab Hussain, then Nayyar Hussain, who has died
 iske baad zaamin hossain, phir kaazim hossain or sabase chote nazim hossain hai

 Twenty by Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 20 vishwa cap main team ke niraashajanak pradarshan ke liye ipel ko jimmedaar tehraane se inkaar kiya lekin mana ki match ke baad kii partiyon or is tii-20 lig ke dauraan adhikadhik yatraaon se khilaadiyon kii fitness ko nuksaan pahunchaa
 Dhoni, the captain of the Indian team, who was out of the T20 World Cup due to defeat in the Super Eight match against Sri Lanka, said, "most of the players were fit and fresh
 khilaadiyon ko keval cricket hi nahin balki ipel ke irdagird jari ghatnaon ke bare main bhi smart rahane kii jarurat he
 We have to understand our body and give it some time to recover
 kyonki iske liye match khilne ke alaava bhi khilaadi ko bahut kuch karne ke liye hota he
 Attending parties and traveling caused damage
 ’’ dhoni ne kaha ki ipel kaa chah saptaah kaa lanbaa is haar ke liye jimmedaar nahin he
 Dhoni said, "our performance is not related to IPL
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘main yah nahin kahuunga ki ipel ke kaaran hamaari taiyaariyon par asar padaa
 In fact, it helped us in our preparations for the World Cup
 isane hamen suresh raina, rohit sharma, ravinder jadeja, pragyan ogna or amit mishra jaise khilaadi die
 It discovered many talents
 ’’ dhoni ne team kii aalochanaon se inkaar karte hue kaha, ‘‘jaisi baaten kii ja rahi hai, main isse chintit nahin hum
 We try to give our best
 ham apane desh ke liye khelte hai
 Wicket-keeper captain Dhoni said that the Indian players did their best but the results did not come out very well
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ham jab bhi maidan main hote hai to behatar karne kii koshish karte hai
 But you don't always do well
 jo ham kar sakate the, hamane karne kii koshish kii lekin ham phir bhi haar gaye
 "dhoni praised the Sri Lankan team for performing all-rounder and said," He batted better in the final overs
 unhone 13wein over ke baad gendbaaji bhi acchhee kii or hamaare liye ran bananaa mushkil kar diya
 The Indian captain also supported his decision to bat first
 unhone kaha, ‘‘mujhe pehle ballebaaji karne kaa bhi pachhtaawaa nahin he
 Even if we had to chase a target of 150 runs while batting later, it would not have been less than 10 runs per over which would have been very difficult
 163 ran kaa bachaav karnaa mushkil tha
 Our score was reduced to a few runs
 agar hamane 180 yaa isse adhik ran banaae hote to hamen bachaav karne ke liye 160-170 ran milte or yah bachaav karne ke liye acha score hota
 Asked about the captaincy pressure, Dhoni said, "when you play for India, there is always pressure
" yah khel kaa hissaa he
 i have never played a match that does not have pressure

 shivasena ne chicago main aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ke hinduon ko lekar die bayaan par tikhi pratikriya vyakt kii he
 In the Sena mouthpiece Saamna, the party chief Uddhav Thackeray has questioned the Sangh chief's statement that Hindus have no ambition to dominate, not aggression
 bhagwat nechicagomein kaha tha ki ek samaaj ke rup main hinduon ko ekatra hokar maanav jati ke kalyaan ke liye koshish kerani chahie
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray wrote on Bhagwat's statement in 'saamana' editorial - 'this is an accusation against Hindus
 hindu aakraamak hon, matlab kya karen? or aakraamak hue hinduon ko unke hi raaj main kanoonee tanks tale kuchlaa ja rahaa hoga to uske liye sangh kii jholii main koun-sa chuuran he? hinduon kii varchasv banane kii mahatvakanksha thi isliye chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ne hindvi swarajya kii sthapana kii
 "bajirao Peshwa waved the flag of Hinduism even further than Afghanistan, Pakistan
" tathya tope or mangal pandey se lekar vir saavarkar tak kai logon ne hindu varchasv ke liye hi britishon se sangharsh kiya
 Had the Hindu not been aggressive, Ayodhya's Babri stigma would not have been wiped out and Shiv Sena's aggressive Hindutva was behind all this
 ''1992-93 ke mumbai dange ke samay shivasena kaa aakraamak hindutv nahin hota to waisi bhayankar sthiti yahaan ke samast hinduon kii ho gai hoti? us samay ye sab vaishvik hindu congress vaale kahaan chhipe the?'satta main aae hinduon ne kya kiyasampadakeey me uddhav thakare ne bijepi ke hindutv ke agenda par bhi tippanee kii
 At the same time, resentment was also expressed in the bjp's attitude towards Shiv Sena
 sampadakeey main likhaa gaya he- 'shivasena pramukh ke mumbai main 'dahaadte' hi vaishno devi or amarnath yatra nirvighn sampann hui or aatankiyon kii hari lungiyaan pili ho garin, lekin hindu ke rup main jo satta main aae, unhone kya kiya?''hindu aakraamak or ekajute tha isiilie modi pradhanmantri bane
 What was the result of that solidarity and aggression? After breaking ties with the Shiv Sena, he saw a dagger in the back of Hindutva, and those who were shouting aggressive Hindutva, national interest, started to make BJP an enemy
 ''hindutv kii seedhi ke sahare satta main aana or kaam hote hi seedhi phenk dena, aisa hindutv in dinon jari he
 Now the ambition of the ostensible Hindutvaists sitting in power is to stop the voice of Hindutva aggression, to eliminate Hindus as terrorists in their own Hindustan
 chicago main hindu congress main bhagwat ne in vishyon par kuch kaha hota to or acha hota
 BJP Uddhav Thackeray, who is using Hindus, questioned why the Shiv Sena or any other party was not invited to carry forward the flag of Hindutva at the Global Hindu Conference held in Chicago
 sampadakeey main likhaa gaya he ki congress ne jis tarah musalamaanon kaa istemaal kiya, usee tarah bijepi hinduon kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 Such sentiment has started growing and Uddhav Thackeray feels so
 sampadakeey ke aakhir main uddhav likhte hai- 'maujuuda 'hindutvvaadi' shashan main hinduon kii khushaamad to chhodie unhen 'secular' banaaya ja rahaa he
 From Congress to Congress, such a journey of the country has started
 ' Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi said in Bhopal that there is no difference between the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the banned organization Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) and there is no place in the Indian Youth Congress for the people associated with these organizations

 They should understand India before Italy and Colombia
 rahul gandhi ne yuva congress ke chunaavon ke maddenjar apane teen divasiy daure ke antim din bhopal main patrakaron se charchaa main kaha ki kattarpanthi vichaardhaara ke kaaran ve sangh or simi donon ko ek jaisaa maanate hai

And why, three-fourths of parents refuse to talk about sex with their children? The understanding of Indian marital life is once again moving towards compromise

 But the CAG observed that pillows were not washed in any other Zonal Railways except two Zonal Railways during the period of review due to lack of instructions
 is tarah kaig ne apni jaanch main paaya ki railway main kambal or takiye kii yatriyon ko aapurti kar aane se pehle kaaphi lambii avadhi tak naa to inako dryclin kiya gaya or naa hi inaki safai kii gai
