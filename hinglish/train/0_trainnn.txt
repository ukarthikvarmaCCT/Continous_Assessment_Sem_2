 The Home Office had also signed Mallya's extradition file
 britain court ke pratyrpan vaale aadesh ke baad maalya ne bharat ke bainkon se liye lone kaa mooldhan waapas karne kii peshkash bhi kii thi
 He had said many times by tweeting that he is ready to return 100 percent of the original amount and it should be accepted

 ' Taking an unexpected step on Friday evening, the Government of Nepal has decided to grant free visas to Chinese citizens
 nepal ke videsh mantri camel thapa ke china bhraman main rahane ke dauraan hi sarkaar ne naa sirf is par nirnay liya balki ise tatkaal prabhaav se lagu karne kaa nirdesh bhi jari kar diya
 The announcement of this decision was taken in the announcement of the announcement of the cabinet meeting in afra-tafri by Nepal government spokesperson Sherdhan Rai
 china bhraman par rahe nepal ke videsh mantri camel thapa or chini videsh mantri ke saath mulaakaat ke chand ghante baad hi cabinet ne is tarah kaa faisla kar sabko achraj main daal diya
 This step has been taken by Nepal at a time when its diplomatic and political relations with India are deteriorating day by day

 It is believed that Nepal's Prime Minister KP Oli has deliberately taken this decision to tease India
 nepal main pichley chaar maheene se chal rahe madhesh aandolan main bharat ke apratyaksh samarthan ko lekar donon deshon ke kootnithik rishton main khatas aa gai he
 India is angry with Nepal, in the new constitution, India not only opposed the cuts in the facilities and rights already provided to more than half of the country's population, but also pressuring the government of Nepal to amend the constitution to ensure the rights of the Madheshis
 is
 maovadiyon ke samarthan se tiki oli sarkaar bharat ke is kadam kaa khul kar naa sirf virodh karti ai he balki ise swatantra or saarvbhaum raashtra ke aantarik maamle main sidhaa sidhaa hastkshep qaraar de rahi he
 Diplomatically, Nepal's increasing distance from Delhi and increasing proximity to Beijing can cause trouble for India

 book: cancer se do-do hathlekhak: pushpapal singhpublisher: harpercolins publishars indiakimat: 150 rupeek din meri patni phone par baat kar rahi thi
 After finishing the phone call, in a very inconsiderate voice, told me that our close relative has died of that disease
 hamaare gharon main aisa khauf he cancer kaa ki uskaa naam nahin lete
 Talk about him with gestures
 yah traasadee hi aisi he
 Every day a man comes to know from the report that someone in his family has cancer, just weeds
 uski maut ko nishchit jaan kar bhi khud ko or usko tamaam bahaanon se sambal diya jaataa he
 It is no longer an incurable disease, a good cure
 bade bade aspataal hai
 All these things make unsuccessful attempts to tie up the depleting morale everyday
 lekin sach ye he ki ulti ginati shuru hoti he ek namaaloom taarikh kii jis din sab khatm ho jayega
 There are very few people who survive cancer
 is baar ek lekhak ne cancer ko jhela, usase jang ladi or jite
 The best thing is that from the diagnosis of this disease, to undergo very painful treatment and then succeed, kept an eye on every moment
 phir puure ghatnakram ko karine se aasaan shabdon main dhaal kar har aamo khaas ke liye pesh kiya
 Eminent litterateur and critic Dr
 Pushpal Pal Singh, in the fourth year of life, suffered a terrible disease like cancer and put that pain, fear-filled experience into a book called "cancer with two hands
" darasal beemaari or aspataalon kii bhashaa itani kathin hoti he ki un par baat karnaa hi nahin chahta
 But in this book, the smallest thing about major disease is shared in a very simple way
 beemaari ke vakt rishton main prem or samvednaa, saathiyon rishtedaaron kii jarurat, kharchili or dardanaak chemotherapy or baaki ilaaj kii prakriya, aspataal main laaparvaahiyaan or dushwariyaan, maut ko saamne dekhte hue khud ke andar ghatate badhate atmvishwaas kii bhari puri sachhee daastaan he ye kitaab
 In between, trust in superstition is a non-essential recommendation, but do you know that the patient gets anything relaxed in that too
 kyon padhein
 
 
 What better can anyone tell about cancer and its treatment than those who have gone through it themselves? mrityu kii anishchit nischitata ko mahasoos karne ke liye padhie
 Yes, during that time also due to the increasing need of relationships, the inevitability of money and the illness, to feel the difficulty of the elderly sarcophagus, which has been uprooted, including roots

 Sahu was trying his luck in the Lok Sabha elections for the first time
 unhen parajeet karne ke liye BJP ne jabardast gheraabandi kii thi
 Organization Minister Saudan Singh, Chief Minister Raman Singh and Cabinet Ministers Prem Prakash Pandey, Amar Aggarwal, Hemchand Yadav and Ramsheela Sahu gave their full strength
 phir bhi ve is seat se BJP ko jeet nahin dilaa paae
 After all, why Modi wave could not show its effect in this parliamentary seat, there is a heated debate in BJP headquarters
 haalanki saroj pandey maanati he ki is haar ke liye vah khud jimmedaar hai
 Saroj said, we will contemplate, reacting to this defeat, Saroj Pandey said, "after discussing with the workers, we will take a decision and also talk to the big leaders of the party
 mujhe lagata he ki ye ek vichaar kaa vishay he
 All the workers-leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and our Chief Minister worked very strongly
 iske baad bhi agar aisa parinaam he to ye ek chintaneey vishay he

 " murali ne kaha, "agar gendbaaj lagaataar wicket lete rahete hai to ballebaajon ko hameshaa maidan main utarane ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hota he
 All the teams want a good bowling attack and hopefully we will continue to do so
 " Murali played crucial innings of 75 and 47 runs respectively in both innings of the first Test match at Mohali and India managed to win the match by 108 runs
 murali duusare test main bhi shandaar andaaj main najar aa rahe the or pehle din kaa khel khatm hone tak unhone naabad 28 ran bana liye the
 But then all four days of the match were washed away in the rain and the second Test ended on a draw
 bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) kii aadhikarik website par somvaar ko murali ne kaha, "ek team ke taur par gendbaajon ke umdaa pradarshan se aapako kaaphi aatmbal miltaa he, kyonki aap hameshaa badhat liye rahete hai
 "murali said," If the bowlers keep taking wickets continuously, then the batsmen always have to be ready to take the field

 The BJP has patted the Modi government for its success on foreign policy and has passed a separate resolution in the executive meeting to count the steps taken on this front in the last 10 months
 is prastaav kii khaas baat ye he ki angreji main taiyaar is prastaav main adhikansh jagah india kii jagah bharat likhaa gaya he
 The term India has been used there, which is more prevalent like Make in India, asean-india Conference, Indian Ocean, Indian Institute of Technology, etc
 3889 shabdon main taiyaar kiye gaye videsh niti ke is prastaav main india yaa indian shabdon kaa prayog sirf 14 baar he or wo bhi tab kiya gaya, jab prachlan kii vajah se uske bina kaam nahin chal saktaa
 These are mentioned above
 jabaki bharat or bhartiyata shabd kaa prayog 60 baar kiya gaya he
 Even Make in India has been called instead of Make in India once or twice
 ye baat isliye mahatvapurn he, kyonki sangh parivaar ke bade hisse se ye maang lagaataar uthati rahi he ki bharat akelaa aisa desh he, jiske do naam hai
 One India and the other India
 lihaaza iskaa naam sirf bharat hi kar diya jaae
 But it is not easy to do so, because the word India is used in the Preamble to the Constitution
 supreme court kah chukaa he ki samvidhan ke mul dhaanche main chhedchhad nahin kii ja sakati he
 There was a long debate in the Constituent Assembly on this issue
 kai pratinidhi chaahate the ki india dait iz bharat ke bajaae bharat dait iz india kaa prayog kiya jaae
 Whereas Hargovind Pant believed that only the word Bharatvarsha should be used
 aakhir main sarvasammati se bharat ko bhi joda gaya
 This is important because during the debate many members believed that it would be okay to say India, because it has achieved independence after many centuries of foreign rule and India will be a symbol of Hindu suzerainty
 dilachasp baat ye he ki videsh niti par ye prastaav rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se bijepi main aae ram madhav ne taiyaar kiya he, jo ab party ke mahasachiv hai
 Some basic changes in the foreign policy of India according to the concept of cultural nationalism of the Sangh Parivar have also been specifically mentioned in this proposal
 dashakon se bharat kii videsh niti nehru ke jis shantipurna sah-astitv ke panchasheel siddhant kii baat karti he, use ab panchamrita kaa rup diya gaya he
 The proposal states that Panchamrit will now be the new pillar of Indian foreign policy
 panchamrita yani sammaan, samvaad, samruddhi, suraksha or samskruti evam sabhyataa
 Panchamrit means five nectar
 doodh, dahi, ghi, shakkar or shahad se milakar taiyaar hota he panchamrita jo mandiron par vishesh avasaron par chadhaaya jaataa he or iskaa prasad vitarit kiya jaataa he
 In this proposal on foreign policy, India has been described as a pole star
 prastaav kahata he ki narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad se bharat prajatantric duniya kaa dhruv tara ban gaya he
 Dhruva stars also have a different story in the Indian mythological tradition
 mana jaataa he ki uttanpad ke putr dhruv kii tapasya se prasann hokar bhagwaan vishnu ne vardaan diya tha
 The pole star in the north direction guides everyone
 prastaav main apravasi bharatiyon kaa bhi khaastaur se zikr kiya gaya he
 He has been addressed as an Indian
 vahiin morishas aadi jaise deshon main rahane vaale bhartiya mul ke logon ke bare main kaha gaya he ki wo bhartiyata mul ke log hai
 Prime Minister Modi has been congratulated for declaring June 21 as International Yoga Day

 He has also been praised for the fact that he addressed the United Nations General Assembly in Hindi and is the second Indian Prime Minister to do so after Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 bhartiya sabhyataa ke mantra vasudaiv kutunbakam kaa bhi prastaav main zikr kiya gaya he
 It has been said that with the thought of this mantra, which considers the whole world as one family, India has advanced relationships with many countries around the world in the last ten months
 is dauraan bharat ne 94 deshon ke saath sampark sthapit kiya he
 The Supreme Court has sent a PIL filed against praying in Hindi and Sanskrit at the morning prayer meeting at the Kendriya Vidyalaya to the Constitution Bench for hearing
 yachika par sunwaayee karte hue rahi do jajon kii bench ne kaha he ki samvidhan peeth ab maamle kii sunwaayee karegi
 Also, the matter will be placed before the Chief Justice
 kendriya vidyalayon main sanskrit or hindi main prarthana kya hindu dharm kaa prachaar he, is par supreme court main do jajon kii bench ne kaha ki is maamle ko samvidhan peeth ko sunanaa chahie
 The bench said that it is an issue of religious importance and a bench of two judges has referred the matter to the Chief Justice for the formation of a proper bench
 isse pehle kendriya vidyalayon main subah hone vaali prarthana kya hindutv ko badhaava he? supreme court ne isi sawaal ko lekar daayar piiel par centre se jawaab talab kiya tha
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had issued a notice to the Central Government and the Kendriya Vidyalayas seeking a reply
 supreme court ne kaha ye bada gambhir sanvaidhanik mudda, jis par vichaar jaruri he
 Actually, a lawyer has filed a petition saying that since 1964 morning prayers have been happening in Kendriya Vidyalayas in Sanskrit and Hindi which is completely unconstitutional
 ye samvidhan ke anuchhed 25 or 28 ke khilaaf he or ise ijaajat nahin di ja sakati he
 According to article 92, 'schooling will begin with morning prayer
 sabhi bachche, teachers or principal is prarthana main hissaa lenge
 'this article describes the process of morning prayer to be held in Kendriya Vidyalayas

 sharma ne kaha ki sarkaar ne ramayana paripath (circuit) kii yojana banaayi he jisamen sitamarhi ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 He defended his answer when opposition party mps fired other questions on Sharma, saying no question mark had been placed on Sita's birthplace and that members should have read her written answer in full
 apane likhit uttar main unhone kaha tha, ‘‘bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan ne ab tak sitamarhi jila main koi utkhanan nahin kiya he
 Hence, there is no historical evidence regarding Sitamarhi being the birthplace of Sita

 basapa mukhiya ne mangalvaar ko samvaadadataaon se baatcheet main kaha ‘unki party sansad me vitt vidheyak par pesh hone vaale katautee ke prastaav par samprag sarkaar ko samarthan degi kyonki vah is mudde par sampradayik or fasivadi takato ko kendra main satta me aane kaa avasar nahin dena chaahatin

 unhone kaha ‘main is baat ko yaad dilaanaa chaahati hum ki unke viruddh taj kaaridor or aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle rajg sarkaar main darj kiye gayi the, samprag sarkaar main nahi

 isamen nayaa kuch nahi he
 We have been giving outside support to the UPA government conditionally to keep communal forces away from power
 ’ unhone yah bhi spasht kiya ki katautee prastaav par samarthan ke baavjood unki party badhati manhagaai or samprag sarkaar kii galat aarthik nitiyon ke virodh main apana andolan jari rakhegi

 The BSP chief said that his party's demand is that before the situation goes out of control, the central government should make a big change in its economic policies and prioritize the interests of the poor and Dalits
 haal hi main badhai gayi petrol or dijal kii keemton ko bhi badhati mahangaai ke liye bada kaaran bataate hue mayawati ne kaha ki samprag sarkaar vipakshi dalon ke virodh ke baavjood apane nirnay ko badalane ko raji nahi hui, jabaki yah nirnay aam aadmi ke hiton kii keemat par tel companiyon ke hiton kii purti ke liye liya gaya he
 Mayawati said that the central government will have to answer this question that when inflation in many other countries is only three to four percent, then why this rate is up to 18 percent in our country
 katautee ke prastaav par congressnith samprag sarkaar kaa samarthan karne ke nirnay ke baavjood basapa mukhiya ne congress ke viruddh apana hamalavar rukh barkaraar rakhaa or aarope lagaaya ki desh main vyaapt garibi, asamanta or berogari aazaadee ke baad se 50 se adhik varshon tak satta main rahi congress kii hi dein he or naksalwad inhen samasyaon se paidaa hua he, jisase sainik karrwai athwa hawaii hamale se nahi nipta ja saktaa

 The property of the citizens of China and Pakistan in India is called enemy property
 supreme court ne raja mahamudabad kii sampatti lautaane kaa aadesh diya tha, jiske baad adhyadesh jari hua tha

 In the parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley explained to the party mps about the three ordinances that the Modi government is now bringing into the shape of the bill

 Addressing a JDU political conference held in Patna, Nitish predicted that the RJD-LJP and the Congress would have to face the brunt of the next assembly elections in Bihar and the flow of investment would flow here during the next NDA term
 unhone kaha ki in teenon partiyon kii bihar main satta main vaapasi kii koshish vifal sabit hogi, kyonki in dalon ne yahaan varshon se satta main rahete huye vikaas karne ke bajaae rajya kii janata kii aankh main dhul jhonkne kaa kaam kiya
 Nitish cautioned the people of Bihar that at present the RJD-LJP alliance and the Congress are talking about contesting separate elections to show off, but after the elections, they will be together again to hold the power
 vipakshi dalon ke aarope ki jadyu or bhaajapa kaa gathbandhan pradesh main sampradayik unmaad ko badhaava degaa, par nitish ne kaha ki vartmaan shashan kaal ke dauraan hi varsh 1989 ke bhagalpur danga peediton ko sikh danga peediton kii tarj kar uchit muaavja diya gaya
 He said that during the current NDA rule of the state, the rioters who were honored during the previous RJD regime, served the case by re-hearing the case and getting them punished
 nitish ne bataaya ki navambar 2005 main jab unhone satta sanbhali thi, to us samay tak apradhi khuleam gum rahe the par unke kaarykaal ke dauraan aise aparaadhiyon ko salaakhon ke peeche bhej kar pradesh main kanoon kaa rajya sthapit kiya gaya
 He said that during the last 57 months of the NDA rule there was no communal or ethnic riot in any part of the state and today people are living peacefully amidst communal harmony
 nitish ne kaha ki ve chunaav se ghabaraae hue nahin he kyonki unhone jabase satta sanbhali he, tab se rajya ke vikaas main lage hue hai
 He said that no matter how misleading the RJD-LJP and Congress should campaign against the current NDA government of the state, but the people of the state will not be misled by them and the people will teach them a lesson in the next assembly elections

 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne elaan kiya ki unki sarkaar nadiyon ko jodgaye ke liye vachanabaddh he or is kaam ke liye sarkaar paise kii kami nahin hone degi
 He said in front of around 10,000 people present there, "soon the work of connecting Kali Sindh, Gambhir and Parvati rivers will start, which will prove to be a boon for farmers
" ”is project main chaar pumping stesan dakshin madhya pradesh main narmada ke sicilya jalashay se har second 5,000 litre pani uthaa rahe hai or indore jile main kshipraa nadi ke udgam sthal ujjaini gaanv main pipe se pahunchaa rahe hai
 It is here that the Sangam Ghat is built for the devotees to bathe

 The objective of this project is to provide drinking water to more than 250 villages in Ujjain and Dewas districts and to industries there and Pithampur
 mukhyamantri kehete hai ki isse 2016 main ujjain main sinhasth kumbh meley ke liye bhi puraa pani milegaa
 He also told that this will also remove the apprehensions of growing desert in Malwa region
 par iske taatkaalik asar bahut alag hai
 Around 4,000 people are reaching Ujjaini daily and it is becoming a pilgrimage center

 Due to uneven ground and grass, natural storage of water takes place
 kshetra main kai nadi naale bhi hai
 He said that the narmada-kshipra project would prove to be a costly deal
 indore main shri govindram secosaria institute of technology of science main professor vinod parashar kii bhi yahi raay he
 According to his estimate, the cost of keeping the narmada-kshipra project running at today's rate is Rs 70 crore
 salanaa hogi
 His question is, "how economically viable will it be and who will pay the electricity for running the pump?" Then this is just the first phase
 sarkaar duusari nadiyon ko bhi jodgaye or sinchai ke liye pani dene kii baat kar rahi he, lekin itani badi laagat ko dekhte hue sirf sinchai se sanchaalan laagat kaa maamuli hissaa mil paanaa bhi mushkil he
 There is no question of spending the project

 The benefactors say that the impact on the Narmada and the local ecology has been ignored
 kai baandh ban jane or narmada se bahut sara pani nikalne se uske astitv ko khatra paidaa ho gaya he
 But the thinking of Madhya Pradesh government is different
 narmada ghati vikaas praadhikaran (envidie) ke upaadhyaksh rajnish vaish kaa kahana he ki ujjain main pani kii jabardast kami rahi he
 The problem has been reduced due to the formation of some reservoirs, but still it has to depend on minor rainfall
 ve kehete hai, ''kshipraa nadi par severkhedi main 400 karod ru
 Dam was to be built at a cost of Rs
 dub kii jameen vaale kisaanon ne virodh kiya or jameen kii badhati laagat se yah naammumkin ho gaya
 "he told that if this dam is built today, the cost of the land alone is Rs 300 crore
 se zyada hogi or baandh par 700 karod ru
 Will cost more than madhya pradesh main baandh virdohi andolanon ko dekhte hue yah kah paanaa mushkil he ki baandh kab tak ban paaegaa
 He said, "the narmada-kshipra link is also replacing this project
" hamen yah bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga ki aabaadi bad rahi he or ujjain main dilli, mumbai audyogic galiyara ban rahaa he
 Which will increase the pressure on existing resources

 They are confident that no matter how much water Narmada Maiya gives to other rivers, their water will never end
 ve kehete hai, ''ab kshipraa maiyaa main saal bhar pani rahegaa
 The river used to dry up after January or February, depending on the rain
 ”shyaam shikaayat karte hai ki nadi jodo project par amal karne vaale narmada praadhikaran ne manamaane dhang se kaam kiya he
 And people did not participate in the decision
 ve kehete hai, ''nadi ke liye khoda gaya rasta kisaanon ke kheton se gujarata he
 Water has started accumulating in the fields due to leaking water
 jaraa-si bhi barsaat hone par pani jameen ke upar aa jaataa he, jisase fasalein kharaab ho rahi hai
 We want the government to put cement in the bottom of the river soon, so that leakage can be reduced and crops can be saved
 ”envidie ke rajnish vaish kehete hai ki sirf saat kimi khudaai hui he
 It was a small canal, which has now widened
 unke anusaar, ''kisaanon ne us par kabja kar liya tha, jise hamane phir se chaalu kiya he
 We are going to put cement in it very soon, so that water does not leak in the fields
 ” par pivade ke kisaan anil choudhary jaise log isse sahamat nahin hai
 He said, "well, when are the roads paved with cement? Rivers are unpredictable, make their own way, and leakage increases soil moisture
 ”bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee narendra modi ne kai manchon par or apane aarthik nazariye main vikaas main nadi linking projects kii bhoomika ko ahm bataakar is soch ko nai hawa di he
 However, he has not clarified how the water will actually flow from here
 pani kii raajnneetibahut-se logon kaa kahana he ki modi to viraasat ko aage badha rahe hai
 They are not the only leaders to say so
 narmada- kshipraa project ke udghaatan ke maukey par bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne bhi sookhe se tabah kisaanon kii durdasha se dravit atal bihari vaajapeyi ke sapane kaa zikr kiya tha

 Advani said that in the previous BJP government, the task force led by the then Energy Minister Suresh Prabhu had worked in this direction, but the current government did not take any initiative in this regard
 upie sarkaar ne 2004 se is kaam main dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 Ramaswamy R
, who was the Secretary of Water Resources in the Central Government
 ayyar ne bataaya ki upie ke nunatam saajha kaarykram main vaada kiya gaya tha ki is project par sab kii salaah se kaam hoga
 He said, "UPA-1 and 2 were both not formally released but deliberately let it remain in the freezer and its political reasons are obvious
" ”modi ne bhi upie kii is upeksha ko ujagar kiya he
 For example, at a Guwahati rally on February 8, he said, "atalji's river link project was a dream to rid the country of the problem of floods and droughts
" supreme court main piiel daakhil hone ke baad court ne manmohan singh sarkaar se states report maangi, lekin sarkaar ne samiti ke gathan main 15 maheene laga die

 ”nadiyon ko jodgaye ke 150 saal puraane is vichaar ke maujuuda avatar main 37 nadiyon ke 30 link banane kii kalpana kii gai he
 Of these, 14 will be in the Himalayan region and 16 in the peninsula
 iske liye baandh banenge or naharen khodi jaaengi, taaki baadh or sookhe se hameshaa ke liye chhutkaaraa mil sake
 But some people believe that this dream of nation building could not be realized because it would connect rivers between states and the ground reality of politics is that no state can dare to give water to another state
 pani kaa masalaa rajyon ke adhikaar kshetra main aata he
 According to Himanshu Thakkar, convener of the South Asia Network on Dams, Reverse and People, "states are becoming stronger and water is depleting
" yah bhaawanaaon se jud gaya he
 In future elections will be fought and lost only on water issue
 ” unka maananaa he ki yah vishay itnaa najuk ho gaya he ki ek hi party kii sarkaron ke baavjood sahmati nahin ban paati
 He cited, for example, that there is a tussle between the BJP governments in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan on this issue
 parvati-kaali sindh-chambal link ke liye madhya pradesh or rajasthan main sahmati kii koshish abhi ho rahi he, lekin is bich madhya pradesh sarkaar ne mohanpura or kundalia par alag se kaam shuru kar diya he, jabaki inhen parbati-kaali sindh-chambal antarraji product kaa hissaa hona tha
 He said, "when we pointed this out, the Madhya Pradesh government clearly said that it has not accepted the plan of the National Water Development Agency (NWDA)

 There is no possibility of this

 “it is no surprise that out of thirty interstate couples, only one project for ken-betwa (madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh) has been prepared
 iske alaava paar-tapi-narmada or damanganga-pinjal project kii vistrut project report taiyaar karne ke bare main sahmati patron par gujarat or maharashtra ke bich hastakshar ho sake hai
 In the case of netravati-hemavati link, Karnataka has also not given permission for a feasibility report
 godavari-krishna link ke liye andhra pradesh sarkaar apni alag yojana par amal kar rahi he
 According to Thakkar, the central government is trying to bring water concurrently in the central list, but it is not going to happen
 anek visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki rajya sarkarein apane rajya ke bheetar hi narmada-hnipraa jaise link par dhyaan dengi

 NWDA Director General S
 masood hossain kaa kahana he ki bharat ko khaadya suraksha ke liye pani chahie
 He said, "the plan to connect the rivers has been made on the basis of techno-economic parameters
 sirf sinchai ke maamle main laagat se dedh guna zyada laabh hoga
 Most of the rain water gets wasted in the sea
 purvi uttar pradesh, bihar, pashchim bengal or assam main bhandaaran kii suvidha na hone se har saal baadh aati he or pani barbaad chalaa jaataa he
 "this argument has merit, but Mihir Shah, Member of the Planning Commission, says that dam construction on rivers reduces silt supply and destroys the ecology of coastal areas
" unhone bataaya ki 12veen panchavarshiya yojana main aadhikarik taur par maan liya gaya he ki itane bade project se baari tabaahi aa sakati he
 India's dependence on monsoon is very high
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki aam taur par puure upmahadweep main ek hi samay par nadiyon main baadh aati he
 Therefore, it is difficult to understand why at that time the already flooded basin would take more water from the other
 Environmentalist Vandana Shiva says that hydroelectric projects have a big hand in the devastation in Uttarakhand
 unke anusaar nadi jodo project ke peeche jal vigyaan or paristhitiki vigyaan kaa thos aadhaar nahin he
 Its purpose is to make India's water a commodity
 vandana shiva bataati hai, ''maine ken-betwa link or sharada yamuna link kaa vistrut adhyayan kiya he
 The logic of transporting water from a flooded area to a dry area is hollow
 bundelkhand main sookhaa padane par ken or betwa donon main pani kam ho jaataa he
 Similarly, at the time of flood in Sharda, Yamuna also gets flooded
 ”kai visheshgyon ko yah bhi andeh he ki itane bade project par kya amal sambhav he

 He said, "there are 30 canals in this river link project

 He also said how sustainable it would be for the unnatural demand to stream the rivers, it is difficult to say and the ruins of many large and small dams which have been left vacant around the world, including India
 haq ke anusaar, ''in sab baton ke aadhaar par behad upyogi dikhne vaale nadi jodo project kahin shuru to ho sakate hai, par mushkilon main funs jaaenge
 The flow of rivers will be draining due to diversion and maintenance costs will be very high

 Its solutions are also suggested in the DPR

 The CBI opposed the plea in the Supreme Court seeking an inquiry into the alleged role of Home Minister p Chidambaram in the 2G spectrum scam
 iske saath hi sibiai ne nyaayalay ke adhikaar kshetra par bhi sawaal kiye
 The CBI opposed the petition of Janata Party President Subramanian Swamy, saying that the investigation into the scam of crores of rupees during the tenure of former Telecom Minister a Raja has been completed
 swami ne jaanch kii maang karte hue aarope lagaaya tha ki tatkaaleen vitt mantri chidambaram spectrum kaa mulya tay karne main raja ke saath shadyantra main sahabhaagi the
 The CBI and the Center objected to Swamy's plea from the beginning and said that he has filed one such application in the lower court and the CBI special court has to decide in this matter
 sibiai ne kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay aisa koi aadesh nahin de saktaa or is maamle main faisla nichali adaalat ko karnaa he
 Senior advocate KK Venugopal, appearing for the CBI, said before a bench of Justice GS Singhvi and Justice AK Ganguly that the lower court and not the Supreme Court had to decide on further investigation or the accused in the case
 venugopal ne swami kii yachika sweekaar karne ke maamle main ucchtam nyaayalay ke adhikaar kshetra par sawaal karte hue kaha ki 2ji ghotaale (raja ke kaarykaal ke dauraan) kii jaanch puri ho gayi he or nichali adaalat dwaara aarope tay karne ke bare main faisla kiya janaa he
 He said that if the court thinks that there is someone to disturb, then his name can be included in the list of accused
 venugopal ne kaha ki yah maamla magistrate ke vishisht adhikaar kshetra main he
 He said that once the investigation in a case is completed, it falls under the jurisdiction of the trial court
 unhone ise bada maamla bataate hue kaha ki swami ek saath do ghodon kii sawari kar rahe hai
 The Center also opposed Swamy's plea and said that the issue comes under the jurisdiction of the lower court
 centre kii ore se pesh varisht vakil pi pi raav ne daleel di ki sangyaan lenaa or maamle kii sunwaayee karnaa nichali adaalat ke adhikaar kshetra main he tathaa ek baar sangyaan le liya gaya to yah vishesh adaalat ke vishisht adhikaar kshetra main he
 Rao said, 'whatever document has been presented in the Supreme Court, it has also been placed before the trial court
 vah ek saath do ghodon par savaar nahin ho sakate
 Swamy, however, denied the allegations, saying that his application before the Supreme Court was different from the petition filed in the special court
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki sibiai chidambaram ko clinit dene ke liye patibaddh dikh rahi he
 He claimed that Chidambaram had met Raja four times between January and July 2008 on the issue of fixing the price of spectrum

 desh ke paanch rajyon main chunaav ho puraa chukaa he
 Election results will come on 11 March
 haalanki har taraf charchaa he ki bijepi desh ke sabase bade or raajnneetik rup se mahatvapurn rajya upi main jeet darj kar rahi he
 There is also a discussion in the Satta Bazaar of Mumbai that the BJP is registering a landslide victory in UP
 praapt soochnaaon ke mutabik sabase zyada satta bhi upi main camel ke khilne par hi laga hua he
 Sattoris are less interested in other states
 aaie ham aapako bataate hai ki sattebaajon ke mutabaki chunaav main koun jeet rahaa he or kis party par kitna paisa laga hua he
 Uttar Pradesh, with 403 assembly seats, needs 202 seats to form the government
 satorion ne iske liye bijepi kaa bhav 160 seat se kholaa he jo 22 paise he
 Similarly, the price of 42 paise for 170 seats, 80 paise for 180 seats, one rupee for 190 seats and one rupee for 200 seats is 80 paise
 iske aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki satta bazaar bhi uttar pradesh main bijepi ko purna bahumat nahin de rahaa he
 The prices of Samajwadi Party and Congress were open from 130 seats, while SP and Congress were open from 220 seats when Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi joined hands
 sapa or congress gathjod kii 130 siton par bhav 42 paise he, 140 seat par 80 paise, 150 seat par 90 paise or 160 seat par 2
 50 rupees
 satorion ke mutabik sapa or congress gathbandhan ko rajya main 150 seat se adhik nahin milane vaala
 If speculators believe, Mayawati's position in UP is very bad
 inhen nahin lagata ki basapa 60 seat se aage bad paaegi
 Its price is also 2 in 60 seats
 50 rupee khulaa he jo bahut zyada he
 In the speculative market, one who has a higher price is more likely to lose
 satta uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke alaava punjab, uttarakhand orgova vidhansabha chunaavpar bhi laga he
 BJP is ahead in Uttar Pradesh along with Goa and Uttarakhand while Aam Aadmi Party is ahead in Punjab
 satorion kaa daawa he ki matganana 11 march ko he isliye 10 march kii raat tak bhav main thodaa pherbadal hota rahegaa
 Satta Bazaar says that they do not believe in exit polls aired on TV channels
 unka apana ek system he or jameen par apane log hai jinke aadhaar par bazaar kaam karata he
 Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni scored a brilliant century in the second ODI against England today, after that the fans on social media were floored on this innings

 New Zealand are once again in 1992 colors in the Cricket World Cup tournament
 are haa, bataate chalem ki vishwacap main rangeen jersey pehali baar cricketron ne tabhi pahani thi
 And the bowlers also came to know for the first time what the punishment of bowling with a white ball at the World Cup could be
 usee worldcup ne duniya ko pinch heater die
 New Zealand opener Mark Grattbach was given the responsibility that he would pick up and play the shot and would only have to cross 30 yards
 is baar greatbatch kii bhoomika main hai brandam mekulam
 Greatbatch success set a new trend in the batting of the power play
 haalanki, tab bharat ke shrikant bhi aise hi shot khelte the, lekin uske peeche unki koi yojana nahin thi
 Taking inspiration from greatbatch, the pair of Jayasuriya and Kaluvitarna were born in the 1996 World Cup
 15 over main hi ranon kaa pahaad khadaa kar do
 It can be said that this thrill of power play probably led to 20-20 cricket
 newjiland ke liye newjiland main khelnaa utana hi phydemand he, jitna bharat ke liye bharat main khelnaa
 He has to play every match of his league, as it did in 1992
 maidan chote hai
 Which boundary is so close, players know very well
 or sabase badi baat, vahaan ke darshak apni team ke samarthan main jabardast maahaul khadaa karte hai
 In 1992, Pinch Hitting and Deepak Patel were introduced to the bowling debut
 is baar vaisaa to kuch nahin he, lekin newjiland kii team main opining maikulam kar rahe hai
 He has also received the New Zealand Sportsman of the Year award this year
 vahaan pehali baar yah kisi cricketer ko diya gaya he
 New Zealand's middle order is handled by Corey Anderson
 anderson yaad hai na, van de main sabase tej shatak lagane vaale
 So far this team has badly beaten Sri Lanka
 331 ranon kaa vishaal lakshya dene ke baad use 233 par olout karke
 In this match mccullum scored 65 off 49 balls and Anderson scored 75 off 46 balls
 scotland kaa match 25 over main nipta diya, to england kaa das over main hi
 Despite all this, the team of New Zealand is also treated like South Africa
 jo form main hui to toornament par dabadabaa kaayam rakhti he
 But it loses in the final crucial matches
 cricket ke diwane jaanate hi hai ki 1992 main newjiland ke semifinal tak ke safar main kya-kya hua
 She reached the semi-finals, winning one-sided in seven matches
 yahaan pakistan ko 262 kaa lakshya diya
 Then he took four wickets within 140 runs
 vah final kii ore bad rahi thi ki aakhri das overon main 22 saal ke injamaam ul haq ne match palat diya
 Under tremendous pressure, hitting 60 runs off 37 balls

 Women of Delhi sit carelessly on a car without a helmet and do not think it necessary to wear a helmet
 jahaan pehle helmet na lagane kaa chaalaan 100 rupee tha, jo ab badhkar hajaar rupee ho gaya he

 ames kii ek study main bhi is baat kaa khulaasa hua he ki bina helmet lagaae hone vaale mauton main dilli main mahilaon kaa aankada sabase zyada he
 Former AIIMS director MC Mishra believes that if there is an accident of two people riding a bike, the person or woman gets hurt without putting a helmet on it
 aise main mahilaon kii jaan jane kaa khatra bhi sabase zyada hota he
 a study by the AIIMS Trauma Center found that only 10% of the people who sit behind the driver on a motor bike wear a helmet, of which 6 to 7% are women alone
 study kahati he ki haadase main 10
 46% of women die and 4
 5% purush jaan ganvaate hai
 The study included 258 women, of which 244 women were sitting on bikes
 sirf 11 ne helmet pahana hua tha, 14 mahilaayein bike chalaa raheen thim to isamen 9 ne helmet pahan rakhaa tha
 It is clear that women are the highest in the number of deaths without a helmet in the accident
 aise main agar aap bike chalaate hai or peeche baitha hua shaks helmet nahin lagaataa he to uske jaan jane kaa khatra sabase zyada hota he
 The study included 2718 men, riding 2460 bikes, of which 1152 had helmets

 saamaanya varg yaa savarnon ke voton par bijepi kii tuuti bolti he, to congress har varg ke vot bank kaa kuch hissaa apane khate main karne main safal rahati he
 a survey of Aaj Tak's Karvy Insights tried to know about the favorite party of different caste classes in UP
 survey ke nattejey in jatiyon ke voting pattern kaa kaaphi had tak khulaasa kar dete hai
 According to the results of the survey, the highest number of votes of general category or upper castes goes to the bjp's account
 bijepi ko milane vaale kul voton main savarnon ke voton kaa hissaa 40 fisadi hone kaa anumaan he
 The main opposition party of the country will not be much successful in wooing this class, at least in UP
 survey ke mutabik use upi se milane vaale voton main se saamaanya varg ke vot mahaj 26 fisadi hai
 The situation of other parties is worse
 yahaan ye baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki in anya dalon main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party jaise dal bhi shaamil hai jo upi main 2017 se pehle ecchhatra rajya karti rahi hai
 Among the votes that other parties are getting in UP, only 12 per cent belong to upper castes

 According to the survey, 24 per cent of the total votes polled by BJP will be from SC-ST community
 congress kii in voton par isse behatar pakad najar aa rahi he
 Of the total votes polled by the Congress, SC-ST votes may be up to 36 per cent
 lekin dalit voton kaa sabase zyada hissaa anya dal khaskar bispi batorti najar aa rahi he
 44 per cent of the total votes received by other parties can be from these same Dalit votes
 agar pichde varg ke voton kii baat karen to congress or bijepi ke khate main inke takreeban baraabar vot aane kaa anumaan he
 Out of the total votes polled by BJP, the share of backward classes can be 36 per cent whereas in case of Congress this figure is slightly higher at 38 per cent
 haalanki dalit voton kii tarah hi is varg ke voton kaa asli adhikaar anya dalon jinamein samaajawaadee party jaise dal shaamil hai, kaa he
 Of the votes that other parties are going to get, 44 percent of the votes are from the obcs
 survey ke nattejey bahut had tak ye baat saaf kar dete hai ki aakhir modi sarkaar ko chunaav se pehle kyon savarnon ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan kaa faisla lenaa padaa or kyon use essi-asti act ko lekar supreme court kaa faisla sansad main palatnaa padaa

 When it comes to the best among the legendary batsmen, some big names come into the mind
 lekin austrailia ke purv cricket captain ian chapel kaa maananaa he ki apane wicket ko khatre main daale bagaiyr teji se bada score khadaa karne kii westeindies ke mahaan ballebaaj bryan lara kii kshamta unhen apni peedi ke diggaj ballebaajon sachin tendulkar or riki ponting se ‘shreshth’ ballebaaj banaati he
 Chappell wrote in his column that the only 400 runs in Test cricket, a triple century and seven double centuries would probably make Lara better than India's senior batsman Tendulkar and former Australian captain Ponting
 unhone kaha, ‘isamen bahes kii koi baat nahin he ki riki ponting bhi sachin tendulkar or bryan ke lara ke saath is peedi ke teen sabase dabadabe vaale ballebaajon main jagah banane kaa hakdaar he
 But who is the best among these three
 ’chapel ne ‘daily telegraph’ main apane kalam main likhaa, ‘lara 400 ran kii pari ke saath test cricket main vishwa ricard dharak he
 He comes after Bradman in scoring big centuries in Test cricket
 usne test cricket main 400 ran kaa ekmaatr score, ek tihara shatak or saat dohare shatak banaae hai
 This is a great achievement especially when you see that both Tendulkar and Ponting have not scored a triple century
 ’chapel ne kaha, ‘sambhavat: yahi vah kshetra he jahaan lara anya do ballebaajon se shreshth he
 His ability to score big
 ’ is purv cricketer ne kaha ki lara ko is baat kii samaj thi ki teji se ran banane ke liye kisi gendbaaj ko nishaanaa banaaya jaae or koun uske liye khatra paidaa kar saktaa he
 Chappell admitted that Ponting would never reach the mountain of Tendulkar figures but said that the Australian batsman had impressed with his mental strength
 unhone kaha, ‘duniya ko jahaan tendulkar ke 100wein antarrashtriya shatak kaa intjaar he vahiin ponting ne nirantar abhyaas se apni puraani lay hasil kii he or kadi mehnat ke saath ran batore hai
 'chappell said,' Ponting will never be able to match Tendulkar in figures but Ponting was impressed by his mental strength when 'little Master' failed to reach his 100th century due to distracting attention
