 hamaari barason se yahi maang he ki karamsad ko rashtriya darja diya jaenilesh patel kaa kahana he ki yah sardaar patel kaa gaanv he
 This is Patel's land, for many years there has been a demand for giving national status to this village

 People of all classes participated in the fast starting from today to demand for national status to Karamsad

 Have you ever heard that a mother should sell her own children to run her family and provide good education to the children
 shaayad nahin, lekin china main ek maa ne kuch aisa hi kiya
 Yes, a blind mother has confessed to selling her 4 children to run a family
 china ke shihuan praant main rahane vaali dwayu jirong naam kii mahila ne saal 2005 se 2012 ke bich apni 3 navjaat ladakiyon or ek ladke ko bech diya
 The DU has given birth to a total of 6 children so far, but has only kept her elder son and daughter with her
 uskaa kahana he, 'mere paas doosraa koi vikalp nahin tha
 If i was not blind, i would not do this
 main unhen bech nahin rahi hum, balki apane se dur rakh rahi hum
 In return, i am only taking the fees for getting pregnant
 'usne kaha, 'mujhe bacchon se pyaar he
 If i were able, i would certainly raise them myself
 lekin main unhen sahyog nahin de sakati isliye mujhe unke liye achche parivaar dhundne padate hai jo unhen god le saken
 'claiming that he has not done anything wrong, the duo said,' i give children to the families who cannot produce them
 unhen bachche chahie or main unki madad karti hum
 'she says,' The rich spend money in the daughter's wedding, the middle class earns money for the daughter's wedding and the poor man sells the son and daughter
 'is saal janvari main dwayu ko bachche bechney ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya tha, lekin netraheen hone kii vajah se use chhod diya gaya
 According to her, when she was 5 years old, she became blind in an accident and got married at the age of 14
 usne kaha, 'mere mata-pita mujhe boj samajhate the
 He wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible
 jab unhen pataa chalaa ki koi mujhase shaadi karnaa chahta he to unhone jaraa bhi der nahin kii
 However, the duo soon realized that her husband could not hold the job
 uske mutabik, 'puri tarah thik hone ke baavjood vah paise nahin kama saktaa
 In contrast, despite being blind, i have to take care of the whole family
 'jaise-jaise dwayu ke donon bachche bade ho rahe the use unki padhai ke liye paison kii jarurat hone lagi thi
 In such a situation, he decided to sell more children and sell them
 saal 2005 main usne apni duusari beti ko 2,500 yuan main bech diya
 He then sold 3 more children
 kul milakar usne ab tak 10,000 yuan main apane 4 bacchon kaa bechaa he
 In China, a family can produce only one child
 aise main dwayu ne baar-baar apni garbhvatee hone kii baat chhipaai
 DU has now become a grandmother and is now planning to raise money for her grandchildren's studies
 uskaa kahana he, 'main ladako ko acchhee shiksha duungi bhale hi mujhe sabakuch kyon na bechnaa pad jaae
 ' actor akshay kumaar ke bete aarav jald hi marshall art main blike belt hasil kar lenge

If i was the hero i would say'no Amul piya hai so can i like

 In Bihar, RJD President Lalu Yadav is not taking the name of ending problems
 lalu yadav bhale srijan ghotaale main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or up mukhyamantri susheel modi ke istife kii maang kar rahe hon lekin susheel modi ulte unke khilaaf rajya ke baaluu mafia se najdiki sambandh par saboot ke saath aarope lagane kaa apana silsilaa jari rakhe hue hai
 On Friday, Sushil Modi alleged at the Samvadata Sammelan held at the BJP office that Arun Yadav, a sand mafia in the state, registered five flats in a single day at Marchhiya Devi apartment of Rabari Devi
 modi dwaara jari kiye gaye kagajaat ke anusaar arun yadav ne 13 june 2017 ko do karod 53 lakh main paanch flats kaa registration apane bete rajesh kumaar ranjan, deepu kumaar or kiran devi jo unki patni hai, unke naam karaayaa
 Earlier Modi had given allegations and evidence that Subhash Yadav, who is close to Lalu Yadav and running away due to police raids these days, had bought 3 flats
 subhash or arun donon ne flaton kaa registration ek hi din yani 13 june ko karaayaa
 According to Sushil Modi, the income tax should not confiscate his apartment flat, so he got it registered in a hurry
 or iske liye apane najdiki logon se hi kharid bikri jaldi main nibataya
 But RJD leaders say that there is nothing wrong in this and if Arun and Subhash were engaged in sand mining, then the government had selected them for this
 lekin jaankaar maanate hai ki arun or subhash, lalu yadav se apni najdiki kaa phayda uthaate hue saare niyam kanoon ko dhaataa bataate hue apni marji se avaidh khanan jisamen aavashyak anumati ke bina sab kaam karnaa shaamil he, karte rahe
 But ever since the change of power, the Bihar Police, under whose nose he led illegal mining to a position during the Grand Alliance government, has now fallen behind him
 tippaniyan But experts believe that while Sushil Modi is demanding to investigate the sale of the flat with income tax, why is he reluctant to conduct a thorough investigation by the CBI about the illegal business of both these things - sand or ballast? It is not hidden from anyone whether RJD leader or BJP or Janata Dal United, except the Left parties, half a dozen leaders of all parties have been involved in this business
 or kareeb 100 se adhik police adhikari, wo chaahe mukhyalay main baithne vaale hon yaa thana main padasthapit adhikari yaa sipaahi, sabaki mili bhagat se hi rajya main har saal sarkari khajaane ko 1000 karod se adhik kii chapat lagaayi jaati rahi he
 And when the Bihar Police itself is involved in the theft, it would be meaningless to expect honesty and fairness in that investigation
 lekin dekhnaa yah hoga ki is maamle main visheshta rakhane vaali kendriya agency sibiai ko rajya sarkaar jaanch detii bhi he yaa apane police se jaanch or chhapemari kii aupchaarikta kar puure maamle ko rafa dfa kar degi

 But experts believe that Arun and Subhash, taking advantage of their proximity to Lalu Yadav, continued to do illegal mining of their own accord, defying the law and doing all the work without the necessary permission
 lekin jab se satta parivartan hua tab se jis bihar police kii naak ke neeche unhone avaidh khanan ko mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar ke samay ek mukaam tak pahunchaaya, vahi ab unke peeche pad gai he
 The comments lekin jaankaar maanate hai ki jahaan susheel modi flats kii kharid bikri kii jaanch inakam tex se karne kii maang kar rahe hai vahiin wo baaluu ho yaa gitti, in donon chizon ke avaidh dhandhe kii puri jaanch sibiai se karne se kyon hichak rahe hai? ye baat kisi se chhipi nahin ki rajd ke netaa hon yaa bijepi yaa janata dal united, vampanthi dalon ko chhodkar is dhandhe main sabhi dalon ke aadhe darjan se netaa shaamil rahe hai
 And more than 100 police officers, whether they are sitting in the main office or officers or constables posted in the police station, everyone has got more than 1000 crores to the state exchequer every year
 or jab bihar police khud chori main shaamil ho tab usase usee jaanch main eemaandaaree or nishpakshta kii ummid karnaa bemaani hoga
 But it remains to be seen whether the Central Government, which is the special agency in this case, gives the CBI a probe by the state government or will formalize the investigation and raid with its police and will make the entire case go bust

 The old saying is that a thief kills a cough, a wrestler kills a rancid, and a baba kills a maid
 yahi hua baba ram rahim ke saath
 In the early days after coming to the dera, Honeypreet Baba was like a common maid
 magar phir dekhte hi dekhte daasi se khaas or phir puri khasmkhas ho gai
 So much so that Baba changed the entire meaning of the daughter's mouth
 haniprit ke purv pati vishwaas gupta ne to baba kii kaali karatuuton ke raaj khole hi hai lekin ab is puure maamle kaa ek or chashmadid saamne aayaa he jo us raat kaa gavaah he jab shaadi ke baad pehali baar hani baba baba kii gupha main gai thi
 Gurdas Singh is the son of Khatta Singh, the driver of Ram Rahim, and an important witness in the relationship between Honeypreet and Ram Rahim
 gurdas kii maane to ye ram rahim hi tha, jisane pehali baar haniprit par buree nazar daali thi
 He got Honeypreet married and immediately after the wedding one night called her to her cave
 gurdas us raat apane ek kajan ke saath gupha ke baahar duty par tainaat tha
 For the first time that day, he suspected that Ram Rahim was going to do wrong with Honeypreet
 uski apane kazan ke saath isko lekar shart bhi lagi or agali roj subah jo kuch hua, usase uski baat sahi sabit hui
 The next morning Honeypreet came out crying from Baba's cave
 un dinon khud haniprit ke dada dere ke khajaanji hua karte the
 Honeypreet went directly to Dada
 haniprit kii ye haalat dekh kar tab uske dada ne dere main kaaphi hangaamaa kiya or ram rahim ke khilaaf khul kar bolne lage
 But he was then silenced on weapons
 is vaakye ke fouran baad haniprit deraa chhod kar apane ghar fatehabad ke liye nikal gai
 But then some of Baba's henchmen chased Honeypreet and with weapons, picked him up from a dhaba on the way and brought him back to the camp
 kehete hai yahi wo din tha, jab haniprit ne kasam khai thi ki wo baba ko barbaad karke dam legi
 Gurdas now feels that Honeypreet is probably under oath behind this destruction of Ram Rahim
 kyonki ye haniprit hi he, jisane ram rahim ko filmon kaa chaska lagaaya, sant kaa chola utaar kar ram rahim haniprit ke kehane par hi diziner baba ban gaya or har wo kaam karne laga, jo sant kii garima ke ulat tha
 By the way, of course, Rahim may have been the cause of the destruction of Ram Rahim, but the truth is that he is responsible for his own destruction
 sant kii gaddi par baithne ke baavjood ram rahim ke qadam pehle din se hi bahake hue the
 Ram Rahim was fond of blue films
 uske liye dere main alag se casette mangvayi jaati thim or to or dere main ek sadhvi jab usase khul gai to usne usee sadhvi ke jariye dere kii ladakiyon kaa shoshan karne kii shuruyaat kii or maafee dilaane ke naam par skool khol kar ladakiyon ke saath rape karne laga

 'taarikh teen-saadhe teen saal main itani hi badali he, tab daur pattharon kaa tha, ab daur puttaron kaa he
 'tomorrow is going to be elections in UP
 abhi upi ke jo halaat hai, unke anusaar bijepi kii dagar kathin he
 Amit Shah is stuck in Bihar's lift
 upi kii to bijli kaa bhi thikaana nahi rahata
 The BSP is in shock of the Lok Sabha laddu, the Dalit discourse has remained confined till the Kanshi Ram idol is destroyed in the intersection
 congress kii haalat to ye ki twitor waalon ne bhi rahul par chutkule banane band kar die hai
 Who is left in this situation? ab sapa ke ye haal hai ki thrill ke pher main mulaayam singh khud apni party kii naav par barma leki chadhe hai
 Sometimes, looking at Mulayam Singh Yadav, he seems to have taken a task to make ten strange statements on rape
 haal hi main unhone kaha chaar log milakar ek aurat kaa rape nahi kar sakate
 This is not practically possible
 unka kahana sahi tha do din bhi na beete paanch logon ne ek bacchee kaa rape kar diya
 Four did not, five did, Mulayam ji remained
 theory sahi nikali
 The rest should not be questioned on the word 'practical', socialist is also realistic

 dakshin america desh chile main khadaan main fanse 33 logon ko bachaane ke liye yudhstar par koshishen chal rahi hai
 To save them, the work of tunneling is being done
 chile ke jhande ke saath jaise hi surang khodne vaali mashine pahunchi
 a new light of hope was ignited in the homes of the employees trapped in the mine, which were swinging between hope and despair
 logon ke nikaalane ke liye 26 eench chaudee surang banane kii ranneeti taiyaar kii gai he
 Of course, with the arrival of this machine the rescue work is expected to be speeded up but the rescuers say that there are too many obstacles in the path of rescue operation
 surang kareeb aadha mile tak banegi, aise main bachaav dal kaa maananaa he ki is kaam main kai din lag jaaenge
 It may even take a month
 bachaav dal kii aguwai kar rahe edres sogarette kaa kahana he ki rescue oparation puraa karne main teen se chaar maheene kaa vakt lag saktaa he
 This battle with death is very long
 bachaav karmi pehle hi kah chuke hai ki rescue oparation chaar maheene tak khinch saktaa he
 That is, in a small place inside the mine, 33 people will have to protect themselves for the entire four months
 5 agast ko chile ke 33 kaamgaar kareeb aadha mile garhai main khadaan se sona or tamba nikaalane utre the
 This was his daily job
 lekin, us roj honi ko kuch or hi manjuur tha
 As they descended to a depth of 700 meters, a terrible accident occurred
 majdoor khadaan main funs gaye
 21 days have passed since this accident
 bas ek suraakh ke sahare 33 log kisi tarah jinda hai
 But, their fight to the death is long
 darasal, chile ke khadaanon kii khaasiyat he ki inamen bane apatkaaleen sharansthal 20 se 40 foot chaude or itane hi oonche hote hai
 There is also an arrangement for food and drink for emergencies
 yahi vajah he kaamgaar ab tak surakshit hai
 But, for how long these people can stay alive on emergency food arrangements, glucose and other fluids are being sent through a hole in a plastic tube
 taaki fanse hue logon ko jinda rahane ke liye paryaapt khuraaq mil sake
 Along with food, oxygen capsules have also been sent to these people
 lekin, logon ko jinda rakhane ke liye sirf khaanaa hi kaaphi nahin
 Adequate air is also required for this
 manobal banaae rakhane ke liye bahari duniya se baatcheet bhi chahie
 Two more holes are being made for this
 ek suraakh se samvaad kii vyavastha hogi or duusare se hawa kii
 The work of both holes has reached its final stage
 khadaan main asprin or doibetes kii dawa bhi bheji gai he kyonki kamgaaron main diabaties or asthma ke marij bhi hai
 Amidst these rescue efforts, the sea of emotions outside the mine is also moving
 khaane ke capshul ke saath khadankarmi ke gharavaale unhen chitthee bhi bhej rahe hai
 Workers are also sending replies to this from inside
 inhen chitthiyon main se ek chitthee chile ke raashtrapati sebastian pinera ne jab padhaa to puraa desh ummid kii roshni se jhilamila uthaa
 It was written in the first letter from inside the mine, the day is coming out
 kisi kaa pita khadaan main band hai to kisi kaa pati
 If someone's brother's life is trapped, then someone's lover is trapped
 chamatkaar kaa intjaar kar rahaa har shaks besabri se rescue oparation khatm hone kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 Last year, three workers were evacuated from a mine in southern China 25 days later
 isse zyada din baad khadaan ke andar se kisi ko jinda nikaalane jane kaa koi maamla nahin he
 Significantly, in 2006, 16 workers trapped in a gold mine in Tasmania were brought alive after 14 days
 behad choti jagah main in kamgaaron ne kaafii mushkil bhare halaat kaa saamana kiya tha
 But, despite the biggest mine accident in history in terms of day, the expectations are alive here
 darasal, isaki vajah yah he ki tamba or sona utpaadan ke maamle main chile duniya kaa agrani desh he
 In this sense, there are very modern equipment for mines here
 aise main ummid jataai ja rahi he ki ye log bachaae ja sakate hai
 Another important point is that the case of gold and copper mines is different from coal mines
 koyala khadaan main mithen gas ke risaav kii ashanka rahati he
 Methane gas diffuses into the atmosphere and displaces oxygen from there
 koyala khadaanon main blike damp or carbon dioxide failane kaa bhi khatra hota he
 However, copper and gold mines do not have such problem
 jaahir he ye baaten ummiden jagaati hai
 33 Chilean families need oxygen at the moment

 He said that a large number of adult customers come to his shop, so why not provide him detention and request him to have safe sex and limit his family to two children
 45 varshiya laal ne kaha ki shuru main unke kuch graahakon ne unke aisa karne par naaraazgi jataai, lekin baad uddeshy samajhane par ve use pasand karne lage or aaj unase unhen koi kathinaayee nahin he
 Nandlal said that he also felt that many people do not buy detention due to shame and such people proved to be very helpful in their efforts
 nandlaal ne kaha ki shuru main apane is prayaas ko jari rakhane main unhen kuch aarthik kathinaayee kaa saamana karnaa pada, lekin use vah pratidin kii bikri ke jariye jari rakhe hue hai
 The wife was totally against it, calling it wasteful, but they refused

 After the meeting, Piyush Goyal blamed Sheila Dixit's government for the current power crisis
 unhone kaha ki pichley ek dashak main bijli utpaadan ko lekar koi planning nahin kii gai
 This problem is from last 12 years
 2002 se hi utpaadan par kaam nahin kiya gaya
 Today when the problem has come, the opposition is working to give it a political color
 aapako bataa den ki dilli main bijli sankat ko lekar hui baithak main dilli ke up-rajyapal najeeb jang, kendriya urja sachiv or dilli sarkaar ke varisht adhikariyon ne hissaa liya
 Electricity companies of Delhi also participated in this meeting
 piyush goyal ne kaha, 'baithak main is sankat kii vajahon par charchaa hui
 The most worrying thing is that nothing has been done to increase power generation in the last 12 years
 faisle nahin liye gaye
 Infrastructure did not work
 planning kii kami rahi
 The policy was in progress in 2002
 2010 ke baad to haalat or bighad gai, ek bhi nayaa project nahin lagaaya gaya
 The result is in front of everyone
 'piyush goyal ne kaha, 'dilli kii jansankhya lagaataar bad rahi he
 Due to the heat, electricity demand has increased
 kitni jarurat he, isaki samiksha nahin kii gai
 Grid capacity was not worked out
 bas transafrmar badha die gaye, kuch mentanence kaa kaam kar diya gaya bas isi par dilli main kaam chalata rahaa
 Attacking the Congress politically, he said, 'some parties gave it political color
 par sach to yah he ki hamaari sarkaar sirf 15 din pehle bani, par jo badahaali 10 saal se he uske liye purvi dilli ke purv saansad sandip dikshit kii maa shila dikshit kii sarkaar jimmedaar he
 The worst situation is in East Delhi itself
 'piyush goyal ne ummid jataai ki agle 10-14 dinon main is samasya kaa samaadhaan ho jayega
 He said that the power grid has done a commendable job till now
 aandhi-tufaan ke kaaran jin linon main samasya ai thi usamen asthaayee samaadhaan kar die gaye hai
 Although a permanent solution will take some time
 iske alaava antipisi ko bijli dene ko kaha gaya he
 It is expected that from 8 o'clock tonight or till late night the situation will improve in some areas
 unhone kaha, 'transmishan or distribution kii line main kami hone ke kaaran aaj bijli kaa aisa sankat dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 We have electricity but are not giving it to the public due to this shortage
 ' bavana plant kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha ki is plant kii kshamta 1500 megawatt he, lekin utpaadan sirf 290 megawatt he
 We have ordered this plant to provide gas
 ummid he aaj shaam tak utpaadan main badhotaree dekhne ko milegi
 The new hair style, walking in heels and tan face are among the few things that make a woman feel sexy
 iske alaava lipstic kaa taaja stroke, vaix kiye hue haath-pair or choti si blike dress bhi mahilaon kii manovaigyanik sthiti par sakaaratmak prabhaav daalate hai
 All these things have been revealed in a survey conducted in the UK, which tried to find out what makes a man and a woman confident
 vahiin, ek purush kaa aatmavishvaas daftar main mili saraahna, shev kiye hue chehre or nae suut se badhata he
 Although both men and women believe that it is a sunny day, booking a holiday and learning something new increases their confidence
 iske alaava kapadon par compliment milane, gym jane or aasapaas doston ke ghire rahane se bhi mahilaon or purushon ko andar se kaaphi acha lagata he
 Car survey company 'kiya' got this survey done
 survey ke mutabik purushon ko nai date milane se khushi milti he, jabaki mahilaon ko agar koi date par chalane ke liye kahe to unhen acha lagata he
 While a quarter of the men like to call themselves Sir, the mood of the women gets better when someone tells them that they have lost weight

 Bishnoi denied the possibility of getting challenged in his traditional seat Adampur
 saath hi yah bhi joda kii vah chunaav ko halke main nahin le rahe
 It will take time for Sonali to understand politics, Bishnoi said about Ticketock star Sonali Phogat, who is contesting against her, that she will take time to understand politics
 unhone adampur ke liye apni yojanaon kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki siver, pani, bijli kii samasya ko dur karne ke saath hi bade hospital kaa nirmaan or bhajanlaal ke naam par vishvavidhyalay banvaanaa unki praathamikta he

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) One morning my wife and i were leaving for breakfast in a restaurant in Houston, USA, and felt like drinking my tea, because i had a spicy breakfast
 lekin main yah bhi jaanata tha ki yahaan chaay nahin milegi
 With this rush of tea, a question arose in my mind whether i would get good tea anywhere in our country? "chaitos founder Nitin Saluja says," i started thinking that there is a place in Delhi, Mumbai or Lucknow where "can i get my typographic tea?" The same question was repeated in his mind that why do people depend on a house or a tea shop for a common thing like tea? The funny thing is that along with the question, the answer also started emerging from within them
 masalan, kahin aisa to nahin ki chaay kaa kaaman test na hone ke kaaran kisi ne is ore ab tak gaur nahin kiya? silsilaa yaheen nahin thama, unke bheetar in javaabon ke saath phir sawaal uthe, har kisi ko kya yah ''meri vaali chaay" dena aasaan he? kahin aisa to nahin ki chaay kii image hamaare dimag main itani sasti he ki kisi ne is par kaam karne kii jarurat nahin samajhi? huston kii us subah ne kai sawaal or jawaab chyos ke founder ke bheetar paidaa kar die
 Overall, a stock of questions and answers gathered in Nitin's mind
 ve ek jawaab khojate to phir usee se laga koi nayaa sawaal khadaa ho jaataa
 But this sequence inspired him to imagine Chaios
 isi uhapoh ke bich unke dimag main ''meri vaali chaay" kaa concept paknaa shuru ho gaya
 They started working just as the simple analytical mind set of an engineer
 din-raat research kerani shuru kii to bahut jaldi unhen pataa lag gaya ki is concept par kuch logon ne kaam karne kii koshish kii thi
 But those people did not start well
 unhone kuch maheene nahin balki farvari 2010 se farvari 2012 yani puure do saal research kii
 Make presentations, prepare Excel sheets, not for anyone else but myself
 nitin ke shabdon main, ''apane hi prajentation ko dekhakar maine kai baar kaha ki nahin, abhi kuch to kami he
 This is not a plan that reaches my heart
 " ve bilkul ek parkhi customer kii tarah ''meri vaali chaay" kii khoj main lag gaye
 Finally, after two years of struggle, he felt that the time had come to realize this dream
 may 2012 tak unke man main yah pakkaa ho gaya ki ab unhen chaay bechni hi he
 He made up his mind to quit his job as an American multinational
 lekin ek senior ke kehane par unhone job ko puri tarah se na chhodkar disambar tak part time kar diya
 In November 2012, he opened his first store in Gurgaon Cyber city
 jaldi hi unhen samaj main aa gaya ki chyos or naukari, donon ek saath sambhav nahin he
 But everything was not so easy
 darasal jab unhone naukari chhodie kaa faisla kiya, us vakt unki patni pregnent thim
 He was going to have his first child
 gharavaalon ko laga ki yah ek bevakoofi bharaa kadam hoga
 This is what happened in a middle class family
 us vakt ke vaakyaat ko yaad karte hue ve bataate hai, ''main lakhanu kaa rahane vaala hum
 Everyone started telling me that it would be stupid to do IIT and then leave the job after getting a good job
 or jab patni pregnancy ke daur main ho, aise vakt main to yah faisla bilkul bhi thik nahin
 My father was quite upset with this decision
 "nitin ke papa ne bhi ejineering kii padhai kii he
 He did engineering from Polytechnic
 haalanki unhone bhi kuch maheene peedblyoody main job karne ke baad bijness hi kiya
 They do iron and steel business
 ve bataate hai, ''papa ne politechnic se ejineering kii thi or maine iity
 So it was a matter of pride for the whole family
 parivaar main iity tak pahunchane vaala main pehla insaan hum
 Therefore, leaving my job and doing business was more disturbing
 haalanki thodi bahut maan-manaal ke baad dhire-dhire sab maan bhi gaye
 "though Nitin mentions his wife Yosha, she says that she was together from day one
 phir unki donon bahanon ne bhi papa ko samajhaayaa
 Mother also came in support
 nitin chyos ke safar ke saath apane dost or bijness partner raghav verma kaa zikr karnaa nahin bhoolatey
 They say Raghav did the work to thicken the dream of Chaos
 nitin chyos kii kalpana ke peeche maa kaa bada haath bataate hue kehete hai, ''sach to yah he ki is concept main meri maa kii ahm bhoomika he
 "actually his mother taught him to make tea at the age of eight
 jab bhi unki saheliyaan aatin to chaay ve hi banaate
 Everyone liked the tea in their hands so much that they would demand tea from Nitin's hand
 bas vahiin se dhire-dhire yah baat unke bheetar kahin gahare baith gai ki ''main behtareen chaay banaata hum
 "even before Chaos' concept, he had thought of two more innovations
 pehla west management or doosraa home depo
 Home Depot means a store where you get everything to build a house
 cement se lekar sainitory ware tak, kichan se lekar garden ke saamaan tak
 But when he mentioned both these ideas to his father, he rejected them
 isiilie chyos kaa idia unhone papa se discus hi nahin kiya
 Taking the menu of Nitin Chayos in hand, he says that people like the desi tea the most
 darasal ise har customer kii maang ke hisaab se banaaya jaataa he
 The ratio of sugar, tea leaves, milk in every cup of tea is exactly what the customer needs
 ''aapako yakeen na hoga, meraa maananaa he ki is tarah se 12,000 prakaar kii chaay ban sakati he
 We also experimented with tea in food
 jaise empi kaa poha, mumbai ke ban muske kii kalpana keval chyos main hi kii ja sakati he
 "nitin, who is full of positive energy, tells a big funny story
 jab chyos shuru hua to log aakar unase poochhate ki yah kis videshi brand kii chen he? aashcharya vaali baat yah he ki jis desh main ghar-ghar chaay pi jaati ho, vahaan ke logon ko yah lagata hi nahin tha ki bharat kaa hi koi insaan aisa idia yahaan laa saktaa he
 Nitin says, "this question of the people convinced him that he had given up the idea that people were waiting for, but was not sure that any Indian could make it come true
" " phir kya tha, ek chaayoj se shuru hua safar 53 store tak ja pahunchaa
 Sitting in Chaiyos' store at the Galleria Market in Gurugram, he laughs with a sip of tea, "some great man has said no," now is the time for tea
 " On the Mubarak occasion of Eid, Pakistan did not desist from spewing poison against India
 yun to koi bhi tyohaar shanti or bhaichaare kaa sandesh detaa he or apeksha kii jaati he ki aise avasaron par log apane aapasi manmutav or ladaai jhagade bhul kar ishwar kaa shukriya adaa karen
 But this may not apply to Pakistan, which has made terror its culture
 id-ul-azaha ke maukey par lashkar-e-taiyyaba ke mukhiya hafiz mohammad said ne to bharat ke khilaaf zehar ugala hi, pakistan ke pradhanmantri nawaz shareef or raashtrapati mamoon hossain bhi isamen peeche nahin rahe
 Everyone, like Mungerilal, dreamed of independence of Kashmir
 apane sandesh main navaj sharif ne kaha ki ham is id ko kashmiriyon ke 'sarvocch balidaan' ke prati samarpit karte hai or pakistan aisa tab tak jari rakhega jab tak kashmir mudda kashmiriyon ke mutabik sulajh nahin jaataa
 He said that Kashmiris will get the fruits of their sacrifices
 sharif ne apane parivaar ke saath rawalpindi main masjid main namaaz padhi or kaha ki bharat se aazaadee paane ke sangharsh main kashmiriyon ne apni teesri peedi kaa balidaan de diya he
 His voice cannot be suppressed with strength
 vahiin pakistan ke raashtrapati mamoon hossain ne id ke mubarak maukey par apane sandesh main kaha ki pakistan aatankwaad se prabhavit apane kashmiri bhaaiyon or bahanon ko hameshaa yaad rakhega
 At this time, the people of Kashmir need our support
 unhone kaha ki jald hi kashmir ke log tyoharon ko aaazaad sarajameen par manaayenge
 The comments udhar lashkar ke chif or mumbai hamale ke mastermind hafiz said ne bhartiya phujon ke khilaaf kashmiriyon kii jang ke safal hone kii dua kii
 It has urged the government of Pakistan to take a tough stand on Kashmir and help Kashmiris in independence
 khaas baat yah he ki hafiz said ne hurriyat ke netritv ko badhai dete hue kaha ki wo kashmir kii janata ko ek manch par laane ke liye sammaan ke haqadaar hai
 Saeed further said that the people of Kashmir have already attained independence
 gulam to wo hai jo allaah main yaqiin nahin karte or mahaz rivaaj ke taur par id manaate hai
 The day is not far when Kashmiris will become free and will set an example for those who are slaves
 un sab logon ko id kii mubaarakabaad jinka khun kashmir ke liye khulata he
 Now it seems that the difference between the talks of both the officially elected representative and the terrorist in Pakistan is becoming very small, which is a matter of concern not only for India but for the whole world
 lekin yah baat shaayad aatank ko apni samskruti bana lene vaale pakistan par lagu nahin hoti
 On the occasion of eid-ul-azha, lashkar-e-taiba chief Hafiz Mohammed Saeed not only spewed venom against India, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Mamnoon Hussain also did not lag behind
 sabhi ne mungerilaal kii tarah kashmir kii azaadi ke sapane dekhe
 In his message, Nawaz Sharif said that we dedicate this Eid to the 'supreme sacrifice' of the Kashmiris and Pakistan will continue to do so until the Kashmir issue is resolved according to the Kashmiris
 unhone kaha ki kashmiriyon ko apane balidanon kaa fal milegaa
 Sharif, along with his family, offered prayers at the mosque in Rawalpindi and said that the Kashmiris had sacrificed their third generation in the struggle to gain independence from India
 unki aawaaj ko takat se nahin dabaaya ja saktaa
 On the other hand, Pakistan President Mamnoon Hussain said in his message on the occasion of Eid Mubarak that Pakistan will always remember its Kashmiri brothers and sisters affected by terrorism
 is samay kashmir ke logon ko hamaare saport kii zarurat he
 He said that soon the people of Kashmir will celebrate the festivals on free ground
 tippaniyan On the other hand, Hafiz Saeed, the chief of Lashkar and mastermind of the Mumbai attack, prayed for the success of the Kashmiri war against the Indian forces
 usne pakistan sarkaar se kashmir par kadaa rukh apnaane or aazaadee main kashmiriyon kii madad karne kaa aagrah kiya he
 The special thing is that Hafiz Saeed congratulated the leadership of Hurriyat and said that he deserves respect for bringing the people of Kashmir on one platform
 said ne aage kaha ki kashmir ke logon ne pehle hi azaadi hasil kar lee he
 Slaves are those who do not believe in Allah and celebrate Eid merely as a custom

 sibiefasi chif pehlaaj nihlani hameshaa surkhiyon main bane rahete hai
 Now, after filing a case of harassment against a journalist, he has again come into controversy
 darasal kuch samay pehle ek video saamne aayaa tha, jisamen ek reporter sawaal poochne ke liye lift main pehlaaj nihlani ke peeche-peeche chali jaati he
 According to Quint's report, Nihalani has also made allegations against reporter Himanshi Chaudhary of threats and breach of privacy
 sensor kaa kaam kya he? aamir khan ne samajhaayaa, kya sun rahe hai pehlaaj nihlani?nihlani ne shuukravaar ko shikaayat darj karwaai he
 However, it is not yet clear whether he has filed a complaint for the controversy of 'jab Harry Met Sejal' or for questions on 48 cuts in 'babumoshay gunman'

 She was also harassing security guards and office staff

 Actually, Mirror Now editor and reporter Himanshi Chaudhary has accused Nihalani that Nihalani had threatened Himanshi and tried to intimidate him by holding his hand
 Quint se baat karte hue editor ne kaha- agar koi reporter sawaal puch rahi he to wo utpeedan nahin hota
 If Mr

 ' One-fifth of the total women working in offices in Taiwan do not want to have a child because of financial difficulties, because raising a single child is their biggest concern
 ek surveykshan me yah baat saamne ai he
 According to the report of the news agency Xinhua, xxrep 4 1 Job Bank released the results of a survey late Monday, in which 874 working women were asked questions
 unamem se 22 fisadi ne kaha ki unhen baccha nahin chahie
 Of the women who expressed desire to have a child, 61 per cent said that Vedo wants children, while 29 per cent said they want a child
 lagbhag 15 fisadi mahilaon ne kaha ki swasthya, vittiya samasya tathaa child saport kii kami ke kaaran garbhadhaaran ko taal diya he
 Daniel Lee, vice president of xxrep 4 1 Job Bank, said that in 2017, the average monthly personal income was 46,422 New Taiwan dollars, the lowest in 16 years
 lee ne kaha, 'ucch aarthik dabaav, jivan kigunvattta par zyada jor, bhavishya ke prati vishwaas main kami tathaa mahilaon ke adhikaron main badhotaree ke kaaran mahilaayein bachche nahin chaah raheen

 Abu Azmi even went a step ahead of Mulayam and said that women who have sex without consent or consent should be hanged
 ek akhbaar ko die intervyuu main abu azmi se jab poocha gaya ki wo mulaayam singh ke bayaan par kya kahana chaahate hai to unka jawaab tha, ‘rape par islam main faansee kii sajaa he
 But here nothing happens to the women while the man gets punished
 aurat bhi kasuurvaar hoti he
 If someone willingly has sex then there is no problem
 vahiin jab shikaayat hoti he to dikkat hoti he
 If you put your hand, then you complain, even if you do not, they complain
 yahaan ye maamla aajkal bahut bad gaya he
 And this ends the honor of a man
 ’azmi ne kaha, ‘islam ke mutabik marji se bhi koi sambandh banaata he to faansee honi chahie
 Hindustan is being hanged for rape
 agar marji se kar rahe hai to kuch nahin hota
 But between free will and free will there is a question of life and death
 sahmati se saath rah rahaa he to kuch nahin hota lekin naaraaz hokar shikaayat kar de to faansee ho jaaegi
 This case is very serious
 ’azmi se jab poocha gaya rape jaisi ghatnaon kaa samaadhaan kya he to unhone jawaab diya- ‘samaadhaan ye he ki koi bhi ladki agar shaadishuda ho yaa avivaahit ho apni marji se yaa bagaiyr marji ke sambandh banaati he to use bhi faansee kii sajaa di jaani chahie
 Both boys and girls should be hanged
 ’haalanki unhone saaf kiya ki kisi ke saath jabaran rape kiya jaataa he to ladke ko hi faansee honi chahie
 Reacting to Mulayam's statement after speaking so much, Azmi said, "I don't know in what context he was speaking, but in the case of rape one should be hanged
" ’gauratlab he ki samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya or uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri mulaayam singh yadav ne ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki sabhi maamalon main rape par faansee dena puri tarah se galat he
 If boys often make mistakes, then it is wrong to hang straight on
 unhone kaha ki mumbai main teen ladakon ko faansee de di gai, jo ki nahin honi chahie

 kejariwal ne dilli kii janata kii sahanubhuti batori or nateeja saamne aa gaya
 The second example is about the word sicku used in speech
 piem modi ne apane bhaashan main bihar ko bimaaru pradesh kaha tha or janata se apil kii thi ki agar vah bijepi ko vot den to agle paanch saal main vah bihar ko bimaaru pradesh se nikaal kar viksit pradesh main le aaenge
 So, what the Central Government figures are false? The same question was raised by Nitish Kumar just after PM Modi's speech
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan narendra modi ne apane bhaashanon main kai aisi baaten kahin thi jo tathyon se pare the
 The best actress Rekha has refused to do Abhishek Kapoor's film 'fitoor' after a few days of shooting and now Tabu has been signed for the role
 khabaron ke mutabikrekhane kuch dinon kii shooting ke baad kuch shots ko dubaara shoot karne kii chahat jataai thi
 Later, Shrekhane refused to act in the film
 darasal rekha ko film ke final shots pasand nahin aae isliye unhone yah kadam uthaaya
 But recently, the film Critic Rajiv Masand tweeted that it was revealed that Tabu has now replaced Rekha in this film, in which she will be seen playing the role of the great Miss Havisham
 JUST IN: Tabu replaces Rekha as the Miss Havisham character in Great Expectations adap Fitoor starring Aditya Roy Kapoor & Katrina Kaif
 - Rajeev Masand (@rajeevmasand) May 26, 2015 The film 'fitoor' is a film based on 'great Expectations' by Charles Dickens in which Mufti (akshay Oberoi), Begum betrays Miss Havisham (tabu) at a young age
 tabboo ke yang kirdaar ko nibhaa rahi hai actress aditi raav hydari
 The film also stars Aditya Roy Kapoor (noor) and Katrina Kaif (firdaus)
 film ke agle saal 12 farvari ko relies hone kii ummid he
 There are no qualities of a spontaneous speaker
 shaayad isiilie mujhe bhaashan dene kii jagah bhaashan padhane vaali netaa bataaya gaya
 The whole world is going through a strange upheaval
 takanic or usase judaav ke liye gaiyr-barabari or asuraksha lagaataar chunauti bani hui he
 Everywhere society is undergoing rapid and concrete changes
 apane desh main bhi yahi halaat hai
 Our people aspire, desire, impatience and awareness are increasing rapidly
 hamaare santhaan abhi bhi vikaas kii prakriya main hai or unamem nai jaan daalane kii darkaar he
 In the last decades after independence, governments have made consistent efforts to carry forward the legacy of our nation builders
 phir bhi, aaj hamaare saamne ek vaikalpik najariya pesh kiya ja rahaa he ki ham kya the, ham kya hai or hamen kya hona chahie
 This is really pushing us back
 yah najariya hamaare itihaas kii vikrut avadharana par aadhaarit he or hamaare bhavishya ke liye bahut ghaatak he
 We have been an open-minded liberal democracy
 yah pratinidhitiv or sahabhaagita par aadhaarit rahaa he
 It has been strengthened by political competition in which rules, traditions and dignity have been taken care of
 hamaare khule or udaar loktantr ne kabhi ekarupata thope bagaiyr desh kii ekta ke sutara majboot kiye hai
 Our republic has not only given respect and patronage to diverse views, but it has always encouraged discussion
 yahaan asahmati, asantosh or virodh ko bhi sthaan miltaa rahaa he
 It has also demonstrated its capabilities towards dialogue and agreement
 varshon se, hamaara loksamvaad shaleenta, tark-vitark par aadhaarit rahaa he na ki huddangai, hangaamaa or gaali-galouj par
 Our democracy is valued by deliberation, not by unilateral feud, but with accountability, and not by curbing public questions and scrutiny
 hamaara desh, hamaara samaaj or hamaari aazaadee—sab par lagaataar hamale kiye ja rahe hai
 All this is being done under a well thought out strategy which has been fully prepared and efforts are being made to paint India in a new color
 itihaas ko todaa-maroda ja rahaa he, tathyon main her-pher kiye ja rahe hai, raashtra nirmaataaon kaa apmaan kiya ja rahaa he, purvaagrah ko hawa dekar dharmik unmaad failaane kii koshish ho rahi he
 Was India really a big black hole before May 26, 2014? Is all India's growth, prosperity and greatness just the result of these four years? Is it not an insult to the wisdom and wisdom of the people of our country? To deliberately dismiss the achievements that our country has achieved in so many years is nothing but arrogance of power
 hamaari pehle kii sari uplabdhiyon ko, jo desh ke logon ke saajha prayaason kaa parinaam he, ek sanak main khaarij karte janaa kuch or nahin, balki ek akad, ek mithyabhimaan he
 It is not a matter of credit
 yah bharat kii shakti or pichley kai dashakon main bharatiyon ke athak prayaason ko pahchaanane-swikaarne kii baat he
 We all have to seriously consider how our fundamental principles and values of the Constitution are being deliberately attacked
 samvidhan ko badal dene kii tippaniyan darshaati hai ki bharat ke gaurav ko matiamet karne ke liye kis prakaar se kuch log amada dikhte hai
 The provocative statements from the ruling party are not made suddenly or accidentally, they are part of a dangerous preparation
 is nai or khatarnaak paripati ke saboot aapako chaaron taraf dikh jaaenge
 Fear and threats have become everyday things
 isse itar baton ko kehane kii aazaadee hi nahin he, unka galaa ghont diya jaataa he
 Violence is trying to suppress these voices and even murders are being done to suppress the tone of resistance
 apane liye apane tareeke se sochane, asahmati or pratirodh, apni pasand se bhojan, logon se milane-julne yaa apni marji se shaadi-byaah tak kii aazaadee jaisi chizon ke liye jagah hi nahin bachi
 All these are under attack
 jahaan sauhardra or sadbhaav ko badhaane kii koshish hoti thi, vahaan dharmik unmaad badhaane main log jute hai
 Self-styled watchmen attacks and private armies have received government protection
 ve bekhauf gum rahe hai
 Insensitivity towards Dalits and women has increased to dangerous levels
 hamaare samaaj main dhruvikaran ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he or in sabhi chizon kaa sirf ek hi makasad he—chunaav jeetna
 For centuries, the Indian tradition and lifestyle has been such that many streams eventually come together into one
 yah bhaavana mitaai ja rahi he
 Efforts are being made to create it in a new way by manipulating our age old social structure
 uthal-puthal kii is anaavashyak koshish se logon main hataasha, asantosh or krodh upja he jiske parinaam achche nahin honge
 People may be spellbound for a while, but our Republic needs neutral and strong institutions
 sansadeey bahumat ko bahes or kanoonon ko dhwast karne ke license kii tarah nahin liya janaa chahie
 Political opponents are being targeted using investigative agencies
 nyaaypalika main uthal-puthal machi hui he
 Civil society is being silenced
 vishvavidhyalayon or chaatro par beditan kasi ja rahi hai
 a large part of the media is being threatened so that it can give up its role of investigation and not expose administrative flaws, scams and manipulation
 paardarshita ko badhaane or bhrashtachar se ladgaye ke liye artiai kanoon banaaya gaya tha
 Today, this law is in some cold storage
 artiai kaaryakarta maare ja rahe hai
 Aadhaar was to become a medium of empowerment
 iskaa prayog shikanja kasne ke saadhan ke rup main kiya ja rahaa he
 We want to become a knowledge-driven society, but see how the mockery of scientific nature is being made and how intellectuals are being disposed of
 raajnneeti kii aawaaj hi loktantr kaa sangeet he lekin ab is aawaaj ko dabaaya ja rahaa he
 All this is happening in the name of making India a $ 1 trillion economy
 beshak, hamen tej vikaas kii aavashyaktaa he lekin iskaa matlab pehle kar do or phir socho nahin hota
 We are seeing again and again that whether it is a matter of economy or a matter of relations with neighbors or a serious matter related to security and cross-border terrorism, decisions are being withdrawn
 kya adhiktam shashan-pranali kaa arth nunatam satya he? kya iskaa yah arth he ki asahaj sachaai kii jagah vaikalpik tathy le len? naukariyon kaa hi udhaaharan le lijie
 Everyone knows that the employment situation is pathetic
 lekin achaanak hamen yah bataaya ja rahaa he ki 2017 main 75 lakh naukariyon kaa srijan kiya gaya
 Everyday new things were said and the condition of the economy worsened
 jiesti ko lekar jitani kaat-chhaant, jitna raddobadal dekha gaya, aisa lagata he ki bina kisi taiyaari ke sudhaar ke naam par koi hath puraa kiya ja rahaa he
 The farmers were upset but how long it took to get their attention and the efforts to remove their problems were also half-finished
 bharat vichaar kii punarvyakhya ke liye hamaare samvidhan ke maardarshak siddhanton or mulyon ke prati mansa vaachaa karmana samarpan kii jarurat he
 Dedication towards it should be reflected in mind, word and deed

 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye pehla vot dalane main abhi 11 din baaki hai or nattejey 16 may ko aaenge
 But voices have started to rise in BJP and allies that if Narendra Modi becomes Prime Minister, then who will become Deputy Prime Minister
 vipakshi partiyaan chutki le rahi hai ki party ke bheetar ek bada dhada is baat ke liye sakriy he ki party kii kisi surat main 160-170 se zyada siten na aa paaen, taaki narendra modi kii jagah laalkrishna adwani, sushamaa swaraj yaa rajnath singh jaise kisi netaa ko pradhanmantri banane kaa mauka mil sake
 It is being said about the BJP that it has two factions
 ek '170 group' jo chahta he, party kii siten 170 ke upar na jaaen, taaki modi kii jagah koi or piem ban sake
 The second '270 group', which wants to make Modi the Prime Minister
 jaahir he ye sab kaalpanik prashn hai, lekin raajnneeti main kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 That is why even anti-modi within BJP are waiting for their turn
 bijepi main yah aarope bhi lag rahe hai ki kuch netaa chaahate hai ki party kii siten atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main ain 180 siton se upar na jaae, taaki modi pradhanmantri na ban saken
 To confirm these allegations, arguments are being made that under pressure from some leaders, the party has distributed a large number of wrong tickets in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to hurt the party's prospects there
 isi tarah, up pradhanmantri pad ko lekar bhi daawey shuru ho gaye hai
 Arun Jaitley, considered close to Narendra Modi among Delhi's leaders, is in the fray from Amritsar and in his very first meeting, bjp's ally Akali Dal chief Prakash Singh Badal said that with Jaitley becoming finance minister as well as deputy prime minister Will be made
 haalanki jetali ne badal ke is bayaan ko chunaav prachaar ke dauraan die gaye bhaashanon jaisaa hi bataakar zyada tool na dene kii baat kahi
 Meanwhile, about Sushma Swaraj, who is contesting from Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh, the nephew of former Chief Minister Sunderlal Patwa and Minister in the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government, Surendra Patwa said the same thing
 in tamaam bayanon se bijepi ke virodhiyon ko khilli udaane kaa mauka mila he, to vahiin rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii bhaunhen tan gai hai
 The Sangh has already expressed its displeasure over the ongoing tussle over tickets in the BJP
 laalkrishna adwani, murali manohar joshi, sushamaa swaraj or jaswant singh ko lekar sangh ne apana rukh bhi saaf kar diya tha
 Now according to the news, the RSS has made it clear that either Narendra Modi will be the Prime Minister or there will be no one in the BJP
 vaise to sangh ko bharosa he ki bijepi or uski sahyogi partiyaan bahumat ke najadik pahunchenge, lekin agar aisa nahin hota he, to bijepi sarkaar banane ke liye modi kii jagah kisi or ko pradhanmantri banane ke liye nae sahyogiyon kii talash nahin karegi
 It has also been said from the Sangh that if the BJP seats do not come as expected, then Modi will decide himself to form a government or sit in the opposition
 jaahir he sangh kii ore se ye sanket un tamaam netaaon ke liye hai, jinaki apni mahatvakankshaayen jor maar rahi hai
 The Sangh is also facing the fear of large-scale fratricide and this is also becoming clear from the ticket distribution
 sangh is baat se bhi chintit he ki modi ke paksh main bana maahaul kahin in ashankaon ke chalate na bighad jaae ki jarurat padane par bijepi unki jagah kisi or netaa ko bhi pradhanmantri bana sakati he, isiilie yah baat spasht kar di gai he
 But despite this, there is no guarantee that the efforts within the BJP to stop Modi will stop
 aarthik rup se khastahal chal rahe anil ambani ke samooh ke liye ek baar phir unke bade bhai mukesh ambani sankatmochan ban sakate hai
 Anil Ambani group company Reliance Communications (rcom) is going through the process of bankruptcy and now reports are coming from highly placed sources that Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries group company may buy assets of Jio rcom
 arcom insolvency yani diwalia hone kii prakriya se guzar rahi he or iske tahat iske asset yani parisampattiyon kii bikri kii jaani he
 According to sources, Reliance is preparing to bid for Jio in assets
 is ghatana se jude ek varisht adhikari ne hamaare sahyogi prakaashan bijness today ko bataaya, 'yah kharid ambani bandhuon ke liye do tareeke se mahatvapurn he
 The acquisition of rcom's spectrum and towers will strengthen the services of Reliance Jio, which is now preparing to start 5G
 duusari taraf, diwalia company kii navi mumbai main kaaphi jaminen hai (dhirubhai ambani nolej city yaa deekisi jise dhirubhai ne 90 ke dashak main hasil kiya tha)
 The debt of Rs 46000 crores on rcom is significant that at the time of default, Reliance Communications had a total debt of Rs 46,000 crores
 sutron ke anusaar, jeeyo ne apane fibre or tower kaarobaar ko do infrastracchar investment treston ko saunp diya he or apane karj main bhi katautee kii taaki arcom kii kharid or 5ji nivesh ke liye jagah banaai ja sake
 Jio's legal department is closely monitoring rcom's insolvency process
 arcom se mukesh kaa bhi bhaavnaatmak rishtiske pehle march main achaanak sabko chaunkaate hue mukesh ambani ne apane chote bhai anil ko jail jane se bachaaya tha or 580 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kiya tha, jo ki anil kii company ko sweden kii company arikson ko chukaana tha
 rcom also has an emotional relationship with the Mukesh Ambani family, as it was started in the 2000s by an undivided family to fulfill the dream of father Dhirubhai Ambani
 jeeyo ab bhi mumbai sahit desh ke 21 cirkil main 850 megahertz band main arcom ke spectrum kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 rcom had 122 of its 850 mhz band before defaulting
 4 megahertz spectrum jeeyo ko bechney ke liye 7,300 karod rupee kii ek deal bhi kii thi, lekin sanchaar mantralay se isaki ijaajat na milane kii vajah se sauda radd karnaa padaa
 Earlier, rcom had signed a deal to sell its switching node and fiber for Rs 5,000 crore
 arcom ne apana real estate kaarobaar pehle canada kii company brookefield ko bechen kaa plan banaaya tha
 Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City of Mumbai worth 25000 crore is an IT park spread over 133 crore acres
 echdiefasi realty kii study ke mutabik iskaa vailuation kareeb 25,000 karod rupee kaa he
 Failing to repay its debt by selling its assets, rcom decided to apply for bankruptcy on 1 February this year

 Has Bihar Chief Minister and National President of Janata Dal United Nitish Kumar tasked the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders to target his party's National Vice President Prashant Kishore? This question arose when Bihar BJP President Sanjay Jaiswal targeted him while talking to journalists in Delhi
 naagarikta sanshodhan bill par jadyu ke samarthan ke faisle par sawaal uthaae jane par naa to prashanth kishor ke virodh main koi jadyu netaa aayaa or naa hi kisi ne nitish kumaar ke faisle ke samarthan main bayaan diya
 Prashant Kishore targeted Nitish Kumar for his decision to support the citizenship bill
 jaiswal ne media se kaha, 'prashanth ek kaarobaari hai, jinka chunaav sanchaalan karnaa ek vyavsaay hai or wo usee uddeshy se kaam karte hai
 Sanjay Jaiswal said that some people come to serve in politics and some do business
 jo log raajnneeti main dhandha karne aaenge wo jisase paisa lete hai, usee ke paksh membyaan denge

 chennai ke apollo hospital main sarjan baladi venu gopal ke mutabik, chennai ke chote nursing home or clinics is samasya ke sabase bade shikaar hai
 Because the big hospital has money

 Chudasama's victory in the 2017 Gujarat assembly election was questioned through an election petition
 dholka vidhansabha seat se congress ummidavaar aswin rathod dwaara daayar chunaav yachika main ek gavaah ke taur par bayaan dete hue chudasma ne dak matapatron ke pun:satyaapan par aapatti darj karai thi
 Congress candidate Rathod lost to BJP candidate by a margin of 327 votes
 iske baad yachikakarta ke vakil percy kavina dwaara unase (chudasma se) kii gai jirah ke dauraan mantri ne kaha ki vah chunaav yachikaaon ke silsile main sheersh nyaayalay main teen vishesh anumati yachikaayen daayar karne ko lekar afsos jataate hai or maafee maangate hai
 He told the court, 'I am feeling ashamed about the content of the special permission petition (filed in the Supreme Court) and i am sorry for that
 'gauratlab he ki mantri ne sheersh nyaayalay main teen yachikaayen daayar kar ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish paresh upaadhyaay kii nishpakshta par sawaal uthaate hue kaha tha ki adaalat nishpaksh sunwaayee nahin kar rahi he
 However, Justice Paresh Upadhyay, who is hearing the case, said that his (minister's) apology is not needed
 phir bhi chudasma ne is baat par jor diya ki unhone yahaan tak ki apane vakil ko ye yachikaayen waapas lene kaa nirdesh de diya he
 Chudasama's lawyer Nirupam Nanavati said he is embarrassed about the petition and is voluntarily apologizing
 mantri ne yah bhi kaha ki 327 voton se haar kaa antar maamuli nahin he
 He claimed that losing by one vote in the assembly elections and losing by seven votes in the Lok Sabha elections would be considered a minor difference

 Then the bench of Chief Justice Jagdish Singh Kehar referred the matter to the Constitution Bench
 ye alag baat he ki us samvidhan peeth ne apana focus sirf teen talaak par hi rakhaa
 He did not leave any comment on the remaining issues and left them 'open' in a way

 In such a situation, NCP President Sharad Pawar suggested the formula
 congressko pavaar kaa formula jahaan apane paksh main najar aa rahaa he
 At the same time, it is also not disappointing the Chhatrapas joining the Grand Alliance
 somvaar ko ensipi ke ek kaarykram main party adhyaksh sharad pavaar ne kaha ki pehle chunaav hone dijie or bijepi ko satta se baahar kiijie
 After this, we will all sit together and the party whose seat will be the highest, can stake claim for the post of PM
 sharad pavaar ke is bayaan ke raajnneetik myne nikaale jane lage hai
 It can be understood in two ways
 ek to sidhe-sidhe 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jis party kii sabase zyada siten aaengi
 The prime ministerial candidate can be chosen from that party
 is formule ke lihaaj se dekha jaae ko vipaksh kii ore se sabase zyada siten congress ke khate main ja sakati hai
 The party currently holds the maximum seats in the party that forms part of the grand alliance
 itnaa hi nahin, baaki dalon kii tulana main bhi congress kaa aadhaar zyada he
 While the basis of regional parties is limited to their respective states, the Congress is in a strong position in many states
 is lihaaj se 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress baaki dalon kii tulana main zyada siton par chunavi maidan main utregi
 The Congress has fixed a target of winning 200 plus seats
 aise main nishchit rup se congress kii sahyogi dalon se zyada siten aaengi
 Congress will be the strongest in terms of this formula
 yahi vajah he kisivaar kaa formulacongress ko apane paksh main najar aa rahaa he
 If other political meanings of Pawar's formula are derived, then it is raising hopes for satraps
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad jab kshetreey dal baithenge
 Most of these parties will stand with the leader and party
 uskaa palada baari najar aayega
 The satraps of the Grand Alliance are currently in the mood to field in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections without putting forward any faces and defeating the BJP
