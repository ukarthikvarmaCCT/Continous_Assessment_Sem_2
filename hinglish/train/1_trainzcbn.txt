 It is certain that Kim Jong, Marshal of North Korea, cannot be threatened and threatened
 varanaa aisa na hota ki jab jab america use dhamkee detaa tab tab wo kuch aisa karata ki puri duniya hill jaati
 When America was first scared, it did missile tests
 phir daraaya to parmaanu bam ke test kiye
 And frightened, he tested the hydrogen bomb and brought it to a halt
 duniya ne sochaa ab iske aage halaat or kya kharaab ho sakate hai

 An application has been filed on behalf of the Delhi Jal Board in the bench of Justice Javed Rahim of NGT that the water supply of the entire Delhi will be stopped as the amount of ammonia has increased three times in the water
 iske baad engiti ne turant argent basis par maamle kii sunwaayee kii, jisamen dilli jal board ke vakil ne kaha ki turant hamen pani kii supplai band kerani hogi
 Ammonia content has increased due to the water coming from Haryana
 haryana se aa rahi pani main pradooshan kii maatra bahut zyada he
 This pollution is due to the mixing of polluted waste from the industrial unit in Yamuna
 hamen nahin pataa ki kab tak pani kii supplai de paaenge
 The Water Board said that we are compelled to stop the water of the entire Delhi including Lutyens Zone, South Delhi
 pani main ammonia kii maatra 115 se 218 ppm (parts per million)abhi he jabaki pine ke pani main ammonia 15 se kam hona chahie
 If more than this, serious illness like cancer can also occur

 On behalf of Delhi Jal Board, it was also stated in the NGT that since 31 December 2017, the amount of ammonia has been increasing continuously, this is the first time that the amount of ammonia has not decreased since 45 days, hence coming from Haryana The water has to be stopped and the water stored in the Wazirabad plant has to be treated
 iske alaava hamaare paas pani kii kami kii samasya bhi he
 At the same time, Haryana government lawyer Anand Grover told the NGT that we are giving GFX IN 683 quick water without ammonia
 clc (karier line channel or dilli sab branch ) ke jariye de rahe he
 This water is without ammonia level
 iske alaava yamuna main pani kaa flo bhi philhal kam he, shaayad is vajah se pani main ammonia kaa level bad gaya he
 Delhi has the responsibility to fix it
 samasya ke nidaan ke liye pichley kai dinon se dilli or haryana ke bich baatcheet ho rahi thi, lekin ab ye maamla court pahuch gaya he
 The matter will be heard again in the NGT on Tuesday

 bharat ke uttar kshetra main himalay ke madhya chamoli jile main sthit badrinaath desh ke chaar pramukh dhaamon main se ek he or karodon hinduon kii aasthaa kaa centre he
 But the same Badrinath is ashamed at this time because of his chief priest
 badrinaath ke mukhya pujari ve
 Keshavan Prasad Namboodri is in jail on charges of molesting a woman in Delhi
 badrinaath dham ke pichley 238 saalon ke itihaas main yah pehla maamla he, jab mandir ke mukhya pujari ko police ne giraftaar kiya he
 Earlier in 1957, Rawal Vasudev Namboodri was also removed by the badri-kedar Committee in one case
 un par mandir samiti main hi karyrat ek karmchaaree kii beti ke saath chhedchhad kaa aarope tha lekin giraftaar nahin hui thi
 Vishnu then resigned from his post in 2000 due to a dispute between Rawal Vishnu Namboodari and Temple Committee President Vinod Nautiyal
 iske alaava yah dham or yahaan ke rawal kabhi zyada bade vivaadon main nahin fanse
 Rawal's role is considered the most important in the Badrinath temple
 dilli kii ghatana se badrinaath ke prati shradgha rakhane vaale lakhon logon kii bhavanaaen aahat hui hai
 In view of this sensitivity, the badri-kedar committee received V
 keshavan ko pad se hataane main der nahin kii
 Madhu Bhatt, vice-chairman of the badri-kedar temple committee, which oversees the temple, says, "this information was nothing short of a big shock for us
" logon kii bhavanaaen aahat na hon, isliye hamane giraftaar kii adhikrut jaankaree milte hi keshavan ko mukhya rawal ke pad se hataa diya he
 It has now been decided to hand over the work of Chief Rawal to Naib Rawal Ishwari Prasad in place of Keshavan
 paanch sadasyeey jaanch dal bhi samiti ne gathit kiya he, jise jald jaanch kar report dene ko kaha gaya he
 "the incident is very unfortunate," says Ganesh Godiyal, president of the badri-kedar temple committee
 agar rawal bedaag sabit hote hai to unhen dobaaraa niyukït kiya jayega
 "rawal has the right to touch the statue of Lord Badri Vishal in Badrinath only
 is adhikaar ko banaae rakhane ke liye rawal se tapasvi jaisaa jivan jeene kii apeksha kii gai he
 Keshavan is not only a Sanskrit scholar, but also a Bal Brahmachari and a Namboodari Brahmin
 27 saal ke ve
 Keshavan became the Chief Rawal four years ago
 mukhya rawal banane se pehle ve badrinaath main hi naayab rawal ke rup main kaary kar chuke the
 But even before that, he has been accused of many
 kaha jaataa he ki 2009 main mukhya rawal banane ke baad keshavan anek paramparaayen todate rahe hai
 Along with breaking the rule of bathing five times, they broke both the rules of separation of Mahabhishek Puja and Balabhog Puja and started doing both poojas together
 mandir samiti se bhi keshavan kaa anek baar takaraav ho chukaa he
 Says Anusuya Prasad Bhatt, former chairman of the badri-kedar committee, "keshavan Prasad is of a temperamental nature
 ”badrinaath kii puja vyavasthaaon main mahatvapurn yogadan dene vaali paramparaagat sanstha ''dimri kendriya dharmik panchayat” ke adhyaksh suresh dimri kehete hai, ''hamane sarkaar se is prakaran kii ucchstareey jaanch kii maang kii he
 It is very sad and surprising to see Rawal accused of such an infatuation
 ”angrejon ne 1939 main badrinaath kii vyavasthaaon ke liye alag se kanoon banaaya tha, jisamen na keval rawalon kii swechhacharita apitu unke aacharan ko sanyamit karne ke liye likhit praavdhaan bhi kiye gaye the
 Madhu Bhatt says, "rawal has to follow strict traditions during worship in Badrinath
 din main kai baar snaan karnaa, sanyamit bhojan tathaa badrinathpuri se baahar na jane kii varjanaayen hai, jinka sakhti se paalan hota he
 In winter, preparations are being made to make a separate rule to restrain Rawal's conduct so that such a situation does not arise again in future
 ”namboodri ko lekar chal rahe vivaad se philhal uttarakhand sarkaar bachakar nikal rahi he
 When asked about this, the state cabinet minister and Yamunotri MLA Trivendra Pawar said that it is not right to say anything about it
 agar sarkaar mandir ke kriya-kalapon ko niyantrit karne par vichaar karegi to usee forum par raay rakhi jaaegi
 What is the history of Rawal tradition, the credit for restoring Badrinath goes to Adi Guru Shankaracharya
 shuru main puja kii jimmedaari aadiguru kii ore se sthapit acharya parampara ke aacharyon par thi
 Archana of Badrinath came much later due to the Rawals
 1776 main yahaan rawal parampara kii shuruyaat hui or ab tak kul 19 rawalon ko yah daayitv saunpa ja chukaa he
 This tradition has also been established by Adiguru Shankaracharya
 badrinaath main mukhya rawal banane se pehle naayab rawal bananaa padataa he
 Later Naib Rawal is made the Chief Rawal after being removed from the post of Chief Rawal
 badrinaath dham ke mukhya rawal (mukhya pujari) kerala ke namboodri brahmanon main se hi chune jate hai, jinke gale main paidaaishi janeu kaa nishaan hota he, vahi rawal or mukhya rawal ban saktaa he
 Chief Rawal of Badrinath Dham is elected for five years
 kaha jaataa he ki aadi shankaracharya ne aathvin sadi main is mandir kaa punarudghaar kiya tha
 While promoting Sanatan Dharma, when Shankaracharya reached Badrinath in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, he saw the idol of Lord Narayana lying in Narada Kund
 apane pratap se unhone murti ko mandir ke garbhagrih main sthapit kar diya
 Then he appointed his own disciple as a priest there so that the work of worship in the temple would go on smoothly
 tehri ke raja pradeep shah ne 1833 main shankaracharya ke rasoie gopal namboodri ko mandir main puja ke liye adhikrut kar diya
 The difficult and ancient tradition of choosing Rawls has now been modernized
 prayek paanch saalon main rawal kaa chunaav kiya jaataa he, jiske liye mandir samiti baqayada vigyaapan prakashit kar aavedan mangati he
 Hundreds of Sanskrit and ritualistic young pundits participate in this process
 mandir samiti ke padaadhikariyon ke saath hi dharmacharya milakar sanskrit, veda, mantrocchar, dharm or karmkand kaa moolyankan karte hai
 Seven years ago V
 keshavan namboodripad bhi isi kathin pariksha ko paas kar naayab rawal bane the
 After this incident, the demand is also increasing that Rawal should be selected from the pandas of Uttarakhand
 ab is ghatana ke baad badrinaath dham main mandir samiti ne kuch nae kadam uthaakar baat ko apane haath main rakhane kii koshish kii he
 The temple's Rawal, Dharmadhikari, Vedpathi and other pandas and priests have been banned from worshiping, visiting and offering prayers to the devotees
 mandir ke bheetar mobile le jane par pratibandh lagane ke saath hi mandir samiti ke carmikon ke liye mandir main anivaary rup se dhoti pahanane kaa niyam bana diya gaya he

 The Enforcement Directorate has also started an investigation in this matter
 sibiai pehle se hi is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 This scam of more than 11 thousand crores was detected during the audit of the bank

 This is how Shakpanjab National Bank came to know about this matter during the audit
 2011 main bank ke audit ke dauraan 280 karod rupee kaa puraa hisaab nahin lag paa rahaa tha
 After this thing appeared in the audit, the bank thought of taking action on it
 pienbi ke siemdi sunil mehta ne bataaya ki unhen is ghotaale kaa pataa janvari ke tisare hafte main chalaa
 In 2011, the PNB started an internal investigation into the matter after an internal investigation audit revealed a Rs 280 crore transaction

 vah kisi duusare grah se aayaa tha
 Could not understand who drew the lines of religion on earth
 vah insaan kii peeth par uski mohar khoj rahaa tha
 He was calling upon the gods to appear
 vah devataaon ke kho jane kii khabar de rahaa tha
 He was using the gods to protect him
 uski in gustakhiyon se devtaa ruthe hote to vidhu vinod chopra kii banaai or raju hiraani kii nirdeshit aamir khan kii film pike itani kaamyaab nahin hoti
 Had this world filled with devotees also been angry, he would not have given this film two hundred and fifty crores
 lekin devataaon or unhen maanane waalon ke bich khadey mandiron-masjidon, girijagharon or mathon main baithe kuch guru, mahant, baba naaraaz hai ki pike ne unka mazaaq banaaya he
 They are seeing the insult of their creed in their own way behind it
 nahin, pike koi mahaan film nahin he
 It is a business film that entertains
 beshak, yah manoranjan karte-karte vah kuch andhvishwaason par prahaar karti he, kuch paakhandon kii taraf dhyaan khinchati he
 But this film opens up the devotees, but is scared of God
 vah kisi ishwar, kisi devtaa, kisi math ko kathghare main khadaa karne kii koshish tak nahin karti
 He knows that India may need it, but those running religion and political shops will not approve it
 magar pike agar bhagwaan se dar rahi he to dharm ke thekedaar pike se dare hue hai
 Because they too have to save their hypocrisy, not God
 is hindustan main ab devataaon kii pariksha kuch zyaada hi kadi ho gai he
 In temples and mosques, monasteries now have more devotees who play politics than religion
 inhen aadhuniktaa daraati he, khulaapan daraata he, manoranjan daraata he, sadbhaav bhi aatankit karata he
 They want to teach the Gita to everyone, but do not trust the vast form of God
 ve ek film ke jawaab main film nahin bana sakate, ve ek kavita ke jawaab main acchhee kavita nahin likh sakate, ve ek painting ke jawaab main acchhee painting nahin bana sakate
 They only have to burn, break and destroy
 aise bhakton se devtaa bhi darate hai
 r in IPL
 aswin dwaara jose butler ke khilaaf kii gai maankading ke baad duniya bhar ke diggaj ballebaajon main khauf baith gaya he
 This is the reason that during Ashwin's bowling, no non-striker batsman standing at the end leaves the crease and runs out before the ball is thrown for a run
 iskaa jeeta-jaagta udhaaharan shanivaar ko dilli or punjab ke bich khele gaye match ke dauraan dekhne ko mila
 Actually, the Delhi team was batting
 12wein over kii teesri gend ke liye aar aswin taiyaar the
 In front was Shreyas Iyer who was all set to play the shot
 aswin gend karne aae or rabip lekar krij tak pahunche or achaanak ruk gaye tabhi non striker and par khadey shikhar dhawan aswin kii taraf dekhakar teji se krij main or andar aa gaye
 After this, he sat down and showed foot movement
 haalanki, isi over main ek or rochak vakya dekhne ko mila
 For the third ball, Ashwin once again came in the runup and bowled to Iyer
 lekin jaise hi unhone gend deliver kii, non striker and par khadey dhawan ne unhen chidhaane ke liye ek rochak harakat kii
 When people saw this incident on screen in replays, they could not stop laughing

 co / sbb5vbvwspvia @ ipl— bishwa mohan mishra (@mohanbishwa) April 21, 2019 In fact, a surprise IPL match between Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab was played on March 25
 punjab ke captain or gendbaaj aswin ne bina gend phenke hi non striking chor par khadey jose butler ko ran out kar maankading vivaad ko hawa de di
 He did not even warn Butler before he was dismissed
 iske baad diggaj khilaadiyon samet cricket kanoonon kaa sangrakshak maane jane vaale merilabone cricket club (emsisi) ne aswin kii is harakat ko khel bhaavana ke khilaaf bataaya tha
 MCC said, 'after reviewing the case, we do not think it was under sportsmanship
 hamaara maananaa he ki aswin ne krij par pahunchane or tehraav ke bich zyada samay liya tha
 So the batsman hopes that the ball is thrown
 butler ne aisa hi sochaa hoga ki gend phenk di gai he or vah apane kshetra main tha
 At the same time, former Indian cricketer Madan Lal said that Ashwin should have avoided it
 unhone kaha, 'aswin ke str or antarrashtriya kariyar ko dekhte hue mujhe nahin lagata ki unhone sahi kiya
 He is a very big player and such an act is a very small thing
 butler kii jagah agar viraat kohli yaa koi anya bhartiya khilaadi hota to uski kaaphi aalochana hoti
 Such action is not a part of the game
 aswin apni jagah sahi hai
 But, they should not have done so
 ’england ke captain eon morgan ne kaha, 'jo maine dekha, us par bharosa nahin ho rahaa
 The wrong example was set for young players
 aswin ko is par jarur khed hoga
 "england player Jason Rai said," Ashwin had this shocking behavior
 bahut niraashajanak
 'what is Mankading? If the batsman standing at the other end of the match comes out of the crease before the bowler leaves the ball from his hand, then he is called Mankading to run out
 bharatiyon main kapil dev ne dakshin africa ke peter karston ko 1992-93 kii siries ke dauraan Mankading se out kiya tha
 At the same time, in domestic cricket, spinner Murali Karthik dismissed Bengal's Sandipan Das in a similar Ranji Trophy match
 72 saal pehle vinu mankad kii thi 'maankading'13 disambar 1947 ko vinu mankad ne australia ke ballebaaj bill brown ko ran out kiya tha
 Mankad was bowling, as soon as Brown came out of the crease, Mankad dismissed him
 us daure main mankad ne brown ko do baar isi tarah out kiya tha
 However, Mankad gave Warning before Brown was dismissed in the match
 ran out ke is tareeke ko anaupchaarik taur par macanding kaha jaataa he
 At the same time, Shivraj Singh has tweeted that some leaders are seen only during the elections in the state, they spend the rest of their time in palaces

 co / yrmpov2j1d rashtriya swayan sevak sangh (aresas) ke teen divasiy 'bhavishya kaa bharat-rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa drushtikon' kaarykram ke antim din sangh pramukhmohan bhagwatne 25 vishyon se sambandhit puche gaye 215 sawaalon main se kai sawaalon kaa jawaab diya
 While many of these subjects were favorites of the Sangh, Bhagwat openly responded to many unwanted topics
 najar daalate hai bhagwat kii in 10 bade muddon par raay1
 Hinduism wrong word union chief Mohan Bhagwatne said that Hindutva, Hinduness, Hinduism are wrong words, ism is considered a closed thing, it is not an ism
 satya kii anwarat khoj kaa namahindutwahai
 Is a continuous process
 isliye hinduism nahin kahana chahie
 It is Hindutva that can be the basis of communion with all
 bharat main rahane vaale log hindu hi hai
 Some people know about Hindutva, but hesitate to speak
 kuch log nahin jaanate hai
 There is no alienation in India, we have created alienation
 yah ek prakriya he jo chalati rahati he
 Gandhiji had said that the name of the continuous search for truth is Hindutva, s Radhakrishnan has said that Hindutva is a continuous process
 2
 Goraksha Violence and Mob lynching Sangh chief Bhagwat said that it is not right to link people connected with mob lynching in cow protection
 kisi prashn par hinsa karnaa aparaadh he or us par kadi karrwai honi chahie parantu gaay paramparaagat shraddha kaa vishay he
 Cow can become the basis of economy in our country
 gauraksha honi chahie
 It is also a guiding element of the constitution
 gaay ko rakhana jaruri he
 If left open, then events will happen
 gauraksha ke kaary ko protsaahan milanaa chahie
 The attack on cow smugglers is not raised
 yah dogali pravriti hamen chhodani chahie
 3
 dhara 370 or anuchhed 35 esang pramukh bhagwat ne kaha ki dhara 370 or anuchhed 35 e par hamaare vichaar sarvopari hai
 We do not believe them, ie both of them should not remain, this is our opinion
 4
 The grand temple of Ram Janmabhoomi Sangh chief Bhagwat said that the matter of ordinance on Ram temple is with the government and the matter of organizing is with the Ram Janmabhoomi Mukti Sangharsh Samiti and i am not both
 andolan main kya karnaa he, ise ucchadhikaar samiti ko tay karnaa he
 If she asks for advice, i will tell
 main sangh ke naate chahta hum ki ram janmabhumi par bhavy mandir jald bananaa chahie
 Lord Rama is God to the majority people of his country but he is not the only God
 unako log imam-e-hind maanate hai
 Therefore a temple should be built where Rama's birthplace is
 5
 Importance of Sanskrit: Bhagwat said that we do not give importance to Sanskrit, so the government does not give it, if we insist that all the literature of our tradition is in Sanskrit, so we should learn Sanskrit, if it becomes our psyche, then study its heritage also
 Will be able to bhagwat ne kaha ki apni parampara ke mutabik nai shiksha niti banani chahie
 a new education policy is going to come, hopefully it will contain our tradition
 granthon kaa adhyayan shiksha main anivaary he, aisa sangh kaa mat he
 6
 bhashaa se shatruta nahibhagwat bole ki angreji hamaare man main he, niti niamak main nahin
 Start honoring the mother tongues
 apni bhashaa kaa puraa gyaan ho
 Do not enmity with any language
 angreji hataao nahin, yathasthaan rakho
 As the progress of the country, our national language should get a place, it is necessary
 hindi main kaam karnaa padataa he isliye anya praanton ke log hindi sikhte hai, hindi bolne waalon ko bhi duusare praant kii ek bhashaa ko siikhnaa chahie, isse man milaap jaldi hoga, or yah kaary jaldi ho jayega
 7
 atanrajaateey vivaah kaa samarthanabhagwat ne kaha ki ham antarjaateey vivaah kaa samarthan karte hai
 One should not distinguish between humans
 bharat main sangh ke swayamsevakon ne sabase zyada antarjaateey vivaah kiye hai
 It is necessary to look at society with impunity
 isse hindu samaaj nahin bantega
 Therefore, we are trying to organize all Hindus
 8
 Support of reservation Bhagwat said that to remove social inequality, the Sangh will have its support wherever reservation is given in the constitution
 aarakshan kab tak chalegaa iskaa nirnay vahi karenge jinke liye aarakshan tay kiya gaya he
 Provision has been made in the constitution by removing social inequality and equality for all
 isliye samvidhan pradutt sabhi aarakshanon ko sangh kaa puraa samarthan he or rahegaa
 Reservation is not the problem, but the issue of politics on reservation 9
 Election of Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat said, 'sarsanghchalak is not elected in the Union
 main kab tak rahoonga yah main tay karuunga
 i will also decide who will be the Sarsanghchalak after me, but all the rights of the Sangh are with the co-stewardship of the Sangh and it is compulsory for me to do the co-stewardship
 3 saal ke antaraal par sah kaarywah kaa chunaav hota he
 10
 samalangiktasamaj main kuch logon main (samalangikta) he
 Such people are inside the society, so the society should arrange them
 mudda banaakar ho hallaa karne se phayda nahin
 The society has changed a lot so that the society remains healthy so that they (gays) do not fall apart and fall into the trough
 nitin gadakari kaa saal 2013 main duusari baar bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh chunaa janaa tay tha
 But on the last occasion, there were raids of the Income Tax Department against him and then he had to step down from the post of Chairman, Union Highways and Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari is still miffed
 aarope se aahat gadakari'ajtak' ke khaas kaarykram 'sidhi baat' main gadakari ne kaha ki bijepi adhyaksh pad se us vakt jis halaat main hatana padaa tha usko lekar aaj bhi unhen malaal he
 Because whatever allegations were made were Wobebuniad
 shweta singh se baatcheet main gadakari ne kaha, 'main kah rahaa tha ki main nirdosh hum
 But i was convicted of punishment
 mere or mere parivaar ke khilaaf do saal tak kangras sarkaar ne jaanch karwaai or khud clin chit bhi di
 'never BJP President Banungagadkari says that he was very upset for a few days
 is maamle kii do saal tak jaanch chali
 Then he proved innocent in the same Congress government

 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa dream project bullate train ab vivaadon main fasata dikh rahaa he
 The protest of farmers in Gujarat over land acquisition is causing problems
 is project ke liye kisaan apni jameen nahin dena chaahate hai
 Therefore, they are strongly opposed to land acquisition
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki unhen kam samay par somvaar ko hui baithak ke liye bulaayaa gaya tha
 Information about this meeting was given in the newspapers on Sunday through the National High Speed rail Corporation
 kisaanon ke mutabik akhbaar main prakashit soochna main kaha gaya he ki jameen adhigrahan ko lekar yah duusari baithak bulaai ja rahi he, lekin hakeekat yah he ki pehali baithak bulaai hi nahin gai
 The question of farmers is how can a second meeting be called without calling the first meeting? Apart from this, personal information was not given to the farmers about this meeting
 kisaanon ko isaki jaankaree media se mili
 Farmers say that talks about land acquisition are being hidden from them
 isko lekar kisaanon ne vadodara or bharuch colector ko apni maang ke aadhaar par gyaapan bhi saunpa he
 Hasmukh Bhatt, working for the rights of farmers, says that the compensation of the farmers' land should be paid according to today's price
 saath hi iske liye kisaanon ko puraa vakt diya jaae, tabhi wo apni jameen adhigrahan karne denge
 At the same time, PK Dutta, who came to hear on behalf of the National High Speed rail Corporation, said that whatever action is being taken, it is being done according to the rules of the Railways
 haalanki jis tarah se kisaan isbulate trainproject ke liye jameen adhigrahan ke virodh main saamne aae hai, usase to yahi lagata he ki railway ko jameen adhigrahan main kaaphi mashkkat kerani padegi

 shivasena ne gandhi parivaar kii SPG suraksha hataane par jataai chintashivsena ne kaha- suraksha vyavastha par raajnneeti khatre kii ghantigandhi parivaar kii espiji suraksha hataae jane ke maamle par raajnneeti jari he
 On one hand, the Congress party created a ruckus in the Lok Sabha about security, while the Shiv Sena also expressed concern about the safety of the Gandhi family
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr saamana main shanivaar ko kaha ki suraksha ke maamalon main raajnneetik matbhedon ko alag rakhana chahie
 Shiv Sena said that politics of security is a danger bell
 congress kii antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi, unke bete rahul gandhi or beti priyanka gandhi se espiji suraksha waapas lene par chintaa jataate hue shivasena ne kaha ki suraksha ke maamalon main raajnneetik matbhedon ko alag rakhana chahie
 Taking a dig at the central government on the matter of security, the Shiv Sena said that one should not play one's life
 dilli ho yaa maharashtra lekin bhay mukt ho maahaulabataa den ki centre sarkaar ne is maheene kii shuruyaat main gandhi parivaar se espiji suraksha gheraa hataa diya or ab gandhi parivaar ko siarpief kii jed plus suraksha mili hui he
 Shiv Sena said in its mouthpiece Saamana, whether it be Delhi or Maharashtra but there should be a fear-free environment
 gandhi parivaar ke suraksha kafile main puraane vaahan shaamil hona chintajanak he, agar khatre kii ghanti baj rahi he to pradhanmantri ko is maamle par vichaar karnaa chahie
 Shiv Sena asked who in the Union Home Ministry feels that the threat to the Gandhi family has reduced
 kisi kii jindagi se nahin karnaa chahie khilvaadshivsena ne indira gandhi or unke bete rajeev gandhi kii hatyaon kaa bhi zikr kiya
 After which the Gandhi family was given SPG protection
 saamana main shivasena ne kaha, congress yaa gandhi parivaar ke saath raajnneetik matbhed ho sakate hai
 Conflict with the Nehru family has increased in the last five years, but one should not play with one's life
 shivasena ne kaha ki agar gandhi parivaar ke alaava koi or bhi hota to bhi yahi vichaar hote

 loksabhaa chunaavon main maat khaane or phir rahul gandhi ke party adhyaksh pad se istife ke baad se congress anirnay kii shikaar dikh rahi thi
 In such a situation, the Congress has tried to strengthen the party by appointing its new State Congress Committee (PCC) President in Chhattisgarh
 28 june ko adivasee vidhayak mohan markaam ne mukhyamantri bhupesh baghel ke sthaan par adhyaksh pad kaa kaarybhaar sambhala
 Baghel was in this position since October 2014
 (sanyog se, purv congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne is niyukti par muhar lagaai, haalanki unhone kaha tha ki ve istipha de chuke hai isliye ab party kaa koi bhi nirnay unke uttaradhikari karenge
 ) Politics watchers believe that the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the party's highest decision making body, has not taken any decision after the Lok Sabha elections, but Chhattisgarh is an exception
 madhya pradesh or rajasthan main bhi pisisi adhyaksh kii niyuktiyaan honi hai
 In Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Kamal Nath is currently the chairman of the state unit and in Rajasthan, Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot is also holding the post of state president
 to, phir akele baghel aisa kaise kara sake? ve ekmaatr congressi mukhyamantri hai, jinhen rahul gandhi ne milane ke liye vakt diya tha
 Baghel has not only got the new PCC chief, but he has filled a vacant position in his cabinet with the appointment of another tribal MLA Amarjeet Bhagat
 bhaajapa ne bastar kshetra ke vikram usendi ko pradesh adhyaksh banaakar ek adivasee netaa par daanv khelaa tha, jise dekhte hue congress kisi anya samudaay ke vyakti ko yah pad dene kaa jokhim nahin uthaa sakati thi
 The support of tribals (34 per cent of the votes) played a major role in the success of Congress in the assembly elections
 congress ko bhagat (jo rajya ke uttari kshetra se hai) yaa markaam, jo rajya ke dakshini bhaag se hai, main se kisi ko chunanaa tha
 Eventually, Markam was chosen because he had a keen interest in organizational work
 unhen tarjeeh isliye bhi mili kyonki congress ne dakshin kii adivasee bahul bastar loksabhaa seat jiti thi
 Another strong leader of the party T
 es
 Markdev was also supported by Singhdev, who is considered an opponent of Bhagat, making his appointment easier
 bhagat sarguja jile ke sitapur nirvachan kshetra (jise singhdev kaa garh mana jaataa he) kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 In order to assert his supremacy, Baghel gave Bhagat his cabinet, which Singhdev did not want
 iske saath hi, bhagat chaar baar ke vidhayak hai or unhen aage badhaayaa ja rahaa he jisko lekar rajnatik paryvekshakon kaa mat he ki aisa ambikapur mandal main singhdev ke saamne ek vaikalpik power centre taiyaar karne ke makasad se kiya gaya he
 Sources say that it was easier for Rahul Gandhi to take a decision on Chhattisgarh as there are fewer complications than the neighboring state of Madhya Pradesh
 madhya pradesh main nae pisisi adhyaksh kii niyukti kii pratiksha lambey samay se kii ja rahi he, lekin pradesh ke do diggaj netaaon, digvijay singh or jyotiraditya sindhiya ko kisi ek naam ke liye raji karnaa thodaa tedha kaam he
 In Chhattisgarh, the general secretary in charge of the state P
R
 el
 Punia has also played the role
 markaam bastar kii kondagaanv seat se do baar ke vidhayak hai
 His first challenge will be to ensure the party's victory in the assembly by-elections in Dantewada and Chitrakoot

 lekin america ne iesas ke safaae ke liye jo taiyaari kii he, uske amal main aate hi bagdadi or uske gurgey ghutanon ke bal rengne ko majaboor ho jaaenge
 Because America is now going to land seventeen hundred commandos of 'airborne', one of the most capable troops of its army in Iraq, on every bullet fired by guns, the name of the terrorists is written
 iraq ke mosul main ab luka chhipi kaa khel khatm samajhie
 1700 Yamdoots, not one or two, are going to land on this land
 jo bagdadi ke gurgon ko unke bilon main ghuskar maarenge
 Blue print of this most dangerous plan has been prepared so far to end the terror
 kab, kahaan or kaise
 How these human cancers will be operated and sent from Iraq to Jahannam, now all will see the world very soon
 kyonki aa rahe hai airbarn
 He is the most dangerous commando in the world, who shoots first and hears them later
 bagdadi agar mar gaya to kair duniyavi jhanjhaton se azaad ho gaya, lekin yadi wo jinda he to ek baat ganth baandh le ki ye commandon apni pe aa gaye, to use use pataal se bhi ghaseet laaenge
 This is the army of America, which has not failed any operation so far
 iskaa ek-ek faujee apane aap main ek tukdi kii takat rakhata he
 Now this force is going to enter Iraq
 yahaan ye bagdadi ke aatankiyon par kaal banakar tootenge
 It was just a trailer

 Those who are alive, pray to the one above
 aasmaan ke raste mosul main in conmados ko utaarne kaa sirf or sirf ek hi hukumat he ki ab america hukumat iraq menaisake saath chal rahe is jang or lanbaa nahin kheenchna chaahati
 The special thing is that till the end of Baghdadi, America was carrying out sky attack on its own side, along with helping other forces fighting on the ground
 lekin ab america sena kii combet team airbarn phul and final mishan ke liye iraqi zamin par utar rahi he
 Which will shoot ISIS terrorists directly

 sai baba ke khilaaf ek or ajeeb bayaan dekar shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati phir vivaadon main hai
 In his hometown Seoni, Shankaracharya described Sai Baba as 'vaishya Son', saying that he was born as a child of his father and Vaishya
 shankaracharya ne kaha, 'internet main yah bataaya gaya he ki pindari bahruddin, jo afghanistan kaa rahane vaala tha, vah ahmednagar aayaa or ek veshya ke yahaan rahaa
 At the same time, these moon mian was born, who is Sai Baba of Shirdi
 internet main to yah dikh rahaa he, aap khud dekh lijie
 
 
 'shankaracharya did not stop here
 unhone to sai baba ke badhate bhakton ko sankramak beemaari kii tarah bataaya, 'hindu to hindu rahegaa, chaahe wo kisi kaa bhi bhakt ho, aakhir wo dikhayega ki wo hindu he
 What we are saying, we are saying from second point of view
 udhaaharan ke liye samajhie, jaise bangala rog hota he, aankh laal ho jaati he, log kehete hai naa ki ye sankramak rog he, dur raho
 In the same way, it is spreading like infectious disease
 kisi bhi vyakti ko jaraa-si bhi takalif ho, to wo chalaa jaataa he sai baba ke yahaan
 When Shankaracharya was asked if he felt jealous that he was suddenly speaking against Sai Baba, Shankaracharya said that Sai's devotees are cheating followers of Hinduism, which is objectionable
 shankaracharya ne kaha, hamako unase irshyaa to nahin ho rahi he, lekin aapatti he
 Today, his followers are showing Sai as a giant
 bansi bajaate dikhaa rahe hai, sheshnag ke rup main dikhaa rahe hai, kahin avatar ke rup main dikhaa rahe hai
 In this way, followers of Hinduism are cheating
 'shankaracharya ne apane grihnagar siwani main bhi sai mandir or uske trustiyon ko lekar talkh baaten kahin
 Seeing the attitude of Shankaracharya, it can be said that this dispute is not going to stop so soon

 Whenever it seems that terror is going to be relieved
 tab-tab ek or aisi khabar aa jaati he, jo raahat ke bajaae, dehshat paidaa kar jaati he
 The world had just realized that the end of ISIS was near and then ISIS played its last bet
 daanv bhi aisa kii ek jatke main uski takat doguni ho gai
 The news is that Baghdadi has formed an alliance
 apane hi jaise khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan al-kaayda se
 Now what will be the result of this alliance
 abhi iskaa andaaza laga paanaa bhi mushkil he
 ISIS also had handshakes with Al Qaeda
 ranjishein bhi thi
 There was also enmity
 magar aatank kii duniya kaa dastur kahata he ki gar saamne musiibat ho, to ek duusare se haath mila lenaa chahie
 There is good in that ye iraq or syria ke maujuuda halaat se paidaa hui aatankwaadiyon kii isi noummidi main bhi ummid dhughane kii aakhri koshish kii gai he
 Which ISIS has done with shaking hands with its biggest enemy in the world of terror
 apni ujaad sultanate ko bachaane ke liye bagdadi ne jawahiri
 
 or jawahiri ne bagdadi kii taraf haath badhaayaa he
 
 aatanki kii dosti kaa haath
 
 taaki naam baaki rahe
 
 iesas kaa bhi or alqaida kaa bhi
 
 varanaa jo halaat iraq or syria main ban chuke hai
 
 usamen akele rahakar na to bagdadi kii khayr he
 
 or na hi alqaida ke nusra front kii
 
 ji nusra front
 
 isi naam se alqaida syria main vidrohi banakar asad sarkaar se lard rahaa he
 
 iraq ke uparashtrapati ne kiya khulhastank ke is mahagathbandhan kaa khulaasa kisi agency ne nahin balki iraqi ke up-raashtrapati ayaad alvi ne kiya he
 It is obvious that there will be some seriousness in these claims
 or agar aisa he to kam se kam ye un logon ke liye khayr kii khabar to nahin jo iraq or syria main inke changul vaale ilaakon main rah rahe hai
 We cannot say that since when but it is so certain that talks are going on in both the terrorist organizations
 bagdadi or jawahiri ke madhyasth log aapas main gathbandhan kii baat kar rahe hai
 ISIS terror will not end without such a road map
 samarthan or raajnneetik hastkshep ke jang ke baad ke halaat par kaabo kar paanaa mushkil hoga
 As we know, even if ISIS is eradicated from Iraq, it is not going to die
 ye jang lambii chhidane vaali hai kyonki iesas ab puri duniya main fail chukaa he
 We have full information that both the terrorist organizations are planning to fight together
 lihaaza yahaan se unke khatme ke baad bhi puri duniya main unke slipper cell maujuud rahenge
 The only way to escape the terrorists is that the latest ISIS situation in Iraq is that iraqi-american forces, Kurdish fighters and Shia militias have almost done their job
 or le-dekar ab mosul ke kuch gaanvon tak hi inke nishaan baaki hai
 At the same time, Syrian forces, along with Russia, have almost done the same thing to al-qaeda in their country
 aise main ab in donon ke paas iklauta yahi rasta bachaa he
 To save your life and also to save your name
 khatre ko bhaanp kar saath aae donon aatanki sanghathanhaalanki kaayade se dekhen to 2003 tak iesas alqaida kii hi branch thi
 But after the overthrow of Saddam, Baghdadi created ISIS in the craze of declaring himself a Khalifa and forming his own organization
 or dekhte hi dekhte apni darindagi kii vajah se bagdadi kaa ye sanghathan iraq or syria ke saath saath puri duniya main dehshat kaayam karne main kaamyaab rahaa
 On the other hand, Al Qaeda began to face danger on its own existence
 lihaaza donon guton main pichley 5-6 saalon se varchasv kii jang chal rahi thi
 But now both of them have understood that the war of supremacy will happen when the name survives and that is why the friendship of terror has moved ahead from both the sides and now it is a threat to the world that these two dreaded terrorist organizations Maybe together now
 fouj par chemical atekairaq or syria se jate-jate iesas ke aatankwaadi apane dushmano par aakiri chot karnaa chaahate hai
 Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, the leader of the terrorists, has already run back from maidan-e-jung, while the remaining terrorists in Mosul are carrying out chemical attacks on the army
 pichley do dinon main in aatankwaadiyon ne do rasaynic hamale kiye hai
 In such a situation, the biggest danger of these attacks is on the heads of innocent cities trapped in the middle of the war
 badi puraani kahawat he, chor chori se jaae, magar sinaazori se naa jaae
 The condition of ISIS militants in Iraq is exactly the same
 mustard gas se hamalaaies ke ahm thikaanon main se ek mosul main fuj or iesas ke bich jari jang main aatankwaadiyon kii haalat lagaataar patali ho rahi he
 But on the go, these terrorists are not missing out on chemical attack on the army
 mosul ke al-abaar ilaake main iraqi fuj par khufanaak mustard gas se hamalaa kiya he, jisase pal bhar main logon kii jaan ja sakati he
 With the help of countries like America and Australia, the Iraqi army is continuously engaged in expelling ISIS terrorists from the country

 The anger of the people against the BJP is so much that the schools, colleges, offices in Jammu remained closed for the second day and operations were stopped
 iskaa asar duusare jilon par bhi dekhne ko mila
 The AIIMS Coordination Committee has also rejected the statement of Health Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Chaudhary Lal Singh that the government will create two AIIMS separately for Kashmir and Jammu

 com / c3m8hvymtv Russia and Saudi Arabia, the world's two largest oil producing countries, can pursue the oil production cut agreement
 aisa is maheene tel utpaadak deshon ke sanghathan opek kii hone vaali baithak ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kiya ja rahaa he
 In a joint statement published by the Russian Ministry of Energy, the two countries have stated that the oil-producing countries' commitment will have to be underlined to ensure sustainable development, forecasting and market stability
 iske liye sahyogi utpaadakon ko apane utpaadan katautee samjhaute ko or nau maheene kaa vistaar dekar ise 31 march 2018 tak badha dena chahie
 According to the statement, Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak and his Saudi counterpart Khalid al-falih met in Beijing and agreed that they would do whatever it takes to achieve the goal of stabilizing the market and cutting oil production Will bring it to an average level of five years
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki mantri anya tel utpaadak deshon se is sambandh main charchaa karenge
 Asian countries benefit from falling crude oil prices The sharp decline in crude prices was witnessed in 2014 by the supply of crude in global market, geo-political tension and strengthening dollar index with shale gas revolution in US
 us vakt america 8
 6 million barrels and Saudi Arabia 9
 7 million bairal crude production kar rahaa tha
 Russia 10 there
 5 million bairal kaa akele production kar rahaa tha
 Hence, supply remained high despite weak demand in the global market
 iske baavjood, crude kii keemton par eurozon, china or anya viksit arthvyavasthaaon main kamjor growth kaa bhi asar padaa tha
 In this global scenario, worldwide crude oil prices were between 30 and 40 dollars for a year-long interval, which directly benefited the economy like India and China
 rus or soudi arab kii chaal se mahangaa hone lagegaa crudebeete 3 saal ke dauraan bhartiya arthvyavastha ko saste crude se badi raahat mili to ab antarrashtriya bazaar main keemton main ijaphe se sarkaar kii chunautiyon main bhi ijapha hona tay he
 With the decision of Russia and Saudi Arabia, if OPEC countries decide to reduce the supply of crude oil, it will have a direct impact on India once again, although this time it will be more of a challenge rather than a relief

 Anand Roop, CPRO of Northern Railway, says that this website is the work of which IRCTC sees and they will convey our point to them

 Railway officials claim that when so many people book tickets at the counter together, the website crashes
 lekin railway counter kii hakeekat ye he ki vahaan bhi zyaadaatar log khaali haath hi lautate hai
 This means that people standing at the ticket counter have the misconception that all the tickets are booked online and those booking online feel that all the booking has been done at the counter

 ’(input-bhashaa) Four Darveshridhesh Bharatiya Gyanpeeth, Lodhi Road, New Delhi-3, Price: Rs 170
 vishay umdaa par treetment nahin: hridayeshbhartiya samaaj main jaise-jaise puunji kii bhoomika nirnaayak hoti gai, ek-ek karke hamaare saare mulya apraasangik hote gaye
 Our way of thinking and paradigm changed
 pratimaan badalte hi vyakti ke gun dosha ban gaye
 Instead of a social person, an autism person emerged, for which relationship-country, society, etc
, only meant to fulfill their selfishness
 aise maahaul main apane maanviya mulyon ke saath jeene or chalane vaale logon kii niyati traasad honi tay he
 Senior narrator Hridayesh's novel is the story of four such elders with four dervish tragedies 
 ramprasad, shivashankar, dilipchand or chintasharan sharma naam ke chaar buudhon kii katha ke jariye hridayesh ne ek tarah se bhartiya samaaj main mulyon ke vighatan kii katha kahi he
 These four old people are not the same but their nature and Mr
 jaaj main ek-duusare se bilkul bhinn hai
 But their destiny is one, even in different living conditions
 ramprasad apane ghar main beti-damaad ke saath rahete hai
 Gradually the situation becomes such that in their own house they are forced to live an exiled and neglected life
 apane hi ghar main marji ke mutabik na ji paanaa or apni choti-choti ichchhaaon-jaruraton kii bhi purti na hona unki traasadee ke mul main he
 He eventually dies one day from a dog bite
 shivashankar bete ke kehane par ghar-baar bechakar apana acha-khaasaa saamaajik jivan chhod uske yahaan rahanaa sweekaar kar lete hai
 Their real tragedy starts from here
 ve apane jivan ke ekaakipan or shahar ke ajanabi maahaul main lagaataar ghut rahe the
 The situation is that earlier their phone was telling the switchoff, now there comes the message that this number does not exist
 jist
 It is clear that they have become obsessed with living neglected and lonely lives
 dilip chand kii katha or kaarunik he
 They get married but their marital life does not start
 patni kahati he ki vah kisi or se prem karti he or uske paas jane kii ijaajat maangati he
 They allow and remain unmarried throughout their lives
 budhaape main apni mausi ke saath hai, jo swayan apane ba-bete se pratadit hokar unke paas aa gai hai
 They lead to suicide by finding themselves misfits in priceless times
 in teenon kii apeksha chintasharan kaa vyaktitv adhik jeevant he
 They also understand the tricks of the times and try to live to a great extent on their own
 lekin unka ek din apharan ho jaataa he or unke bete unhen chhudaane main koi sakriyata nahin dikhaate
 Through the narrative of these seventy-four elders, Hridayesh has tried to underline the changes happening in Indian society
 upanyaas bataata he ki bazaarwaad or upabhoktavaad ke is lolup-lanpat samay main maanviya garima ke mulyon ke saath jeena lagbhag asambhav he
 The novel alternately exposes the real truth behind the current development, where the killing of human values is an essential element
 puunji se sanchalit is samay kii krurta, bhayavahata or moolyaheenata ko ek rachanaatmak kriti ke madhyam se saamne laane main hridayesh bahut had tak safal rahe hai
 In combining the narrative structure, he has shown a mature authorial vision
 puraani or nai peedi kii jeevanasthiti or soch ko unhone saath-saath rakh diya he, jisase mulyon ke vighatan kii puri tasviir khud-ba-khud ubharkar saamne aa jaati he
 From this point of view, this novel is a creative achievement of Hridayesh
 yah uplabdhi or badi ho sakati thi agar puraani-nayi peedi kaa dwandv bhi ve ujagar kar pate
 This novel is a flat work in polyglot, only then it does not touch our senses despite the important content
 rachana ko prabhavakaari banane ke liye jis rachanaatmak kasaav kii darkaar hoti, uskaa abhaav he yahaan
 Many feel that the matter is being forcibly pulled forward
 kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki aadhunik samay kii kurupata or vidambnaa ko ujagar karne ke liye hridayesh ne vishay to bahut badhiya uthaaya he par use behatar treetment nahin de paae hai

 mangalvaar ko bhartiya vayusena kii ore se pakistan ke balakot main kiye gaye hamale ke baad bharat ke videsh mantralay ne bayaan jari kar kaha he ki bharat kaa nishaanaa na to civillian the or na hi pakistani sena
 The action taken by India has been done only to target the terrorists
 bhartiya videsh sachiv vijay gokhale ne apane bayaan main yah bhi bataaya ki hamalaa safal rahaa or isamen aatankwaadi sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke commander ustad gauri, kuch trainer or aatankwaadi hamalon kaa prashikshan le rahe kai aatankwaadi maare gaye hai
 However, no data has been released by the Indian government on the number of casualties
 bharat kii ore se jari bayaan bahut sadha hua or kootnithik he
 Some of the implications of India's statement are as follows
 bharat ne apane bayaan main sidhe taur par kaha ki yah hamalaa pakistan par, uski avam par yaa sena par haragiz nahin tha
 Only terrorists were targeted
 yani bharat yuddh kaa na to apni ore se sanket de rahaa he or na hi pakistan ko yuddh main jane ke liye kisi tarah kii vajah de rahaa he
 By exposing the Foreign Secretary, India prevented it from being an army versus an army
 saath hi vishwa samudaay ko sandesh dene ke liye videsh mantralay ko saamne laayaa gaya
 India called it an attack on terrorists
 isse bharat vishwa samudaay ko yah sandesh de paaya he ki bharat kii yah karrwai yuddh nahin, aatankwaad ke khilaaf bharat ke ehtiyaati prayaas hai
 Explaining why it was necessary to take such action, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said that after the attack in Pulwama, jaish-e-mohammed was also preparing for an attack in many other parts of India and for this, the terrorists on a large scale Training was being given
 bhavishya main pulavama kii punrariti ko rokane ke liye aisa karnaa zaruri tha
 India also indicated that in the fight against terrorism, it is not only an affront to the advocacy of the world community
 wo akele bhi nirnay le saktaa he or aatankwaad se nipatane ke liye khud zaruri kadam uthaane main sakasham he
 If the army's platform was used for the official declaration after India's entry into Pakistan, it would have delivered a tactical message more than diplomatic
 bahut soch-samajhakar bharat ne videsh mantralay ke zarie is karrwai par apni aadhikarik sthiti rakhi he

 First came the news that some of his supporters had gifted him such an expensive car
 shaq isliye hua ki gaadi parking lot main nahin, bilkul saamne, alag se khadi thi

 party ne gaadi kaa jo kaagaj dikhaaya he, usamen aap ke ek kaaryakarta akhil prakaash kaa naam he
 But a close relative of Rakhi Birlan, oblivious to the party's stance, gave NDTV India separate details of the car purchase
 iske mutabik - This vehicle is bought by Rakhi Birlan family - isamen maa kii bachat ke teen lakh rupee lagaae gaye hai - The rest of the loan is taken in the name of Akhil Prakash - kyonki birlan parivaar main kisi ko lone nahin mil rahaa tha
 The comments jaahir he, aap netaa raakhi birlan se pehali poochtacha par hi media ko naseehat dene lage

 Siddharth also wishes to perform negative roles and double roles

 yah aisa kirdaar tha, jisane shahrukh ke staradam ko upar uthaaya tha or vilan hote hue bhi shahrukh film ke hero ban gaye the

 lekin romantic film 'hansi to fansi' or ection film 'brother' flop ho gai

 yash chopra nirdeshit film 'dar' main shahrukh ne psico aashiq kii bhoomika nibhaai thi
 It was a character that elevated Shah Rukh's stardom and despite being a villain, Shah Rukh became the hero of the film
 siddharth bhi abhi yuva hai or unki pichhali kai filmein naakaam rahi hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why Siddharth wants a film like Shahrukh to be played so that the character can make him stand out and stand out from other stars
 siddharth malhotra ne film 'ek vilan' main gunde kii bhoomika nibhaai thi magar wo film kaa khalanaayak nahin tha
 But the romantic film 'hansi To Fansi' and the action film 'brother' flopped
 aise main siddharth jaanate hai ki varun dhawan jaise apane pratidwandiyon ke saamne khadaa hone ke liye kuch alag karnaa hoga or shaayad yahi vajah he ki siddharth shahrukh jaisi bhoomika, kuch mazedaar dabl role vaali film yaa koi negative role kii talash main hai siddharth

 Therefore, in this sequence, he has taken many wrong decisions and paid a heavy price for them

 sansad bhawan main congress ke 3 varisht netaaon- mallikarjun khadge, gulam nabi aaazaad or randeep singh surajevaala kii ore se sarkaar par phir se hamalaa kiya gaya
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said on the affidavit given by the central government that the government is misleading the Supreme Court by giving an incorrect affidavit, such a government should be sacked
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki congress samaj gai he ki rafel kaise bada ghotaalaa bana
 The Modi government is making every effort to hide this scam

 The benchmark price of $ 2 million was changed by the Prime Minister himself, so we demand that the JPC be investigated
 mallikarjun khadge ne bhi kaha ki pradhanmantri or unki vakaalat karne vaale jhooth bol rahe hai
 Why did the prices rise? Congress said on Friday that former Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar had said about the Rafale files that the secret of Rafale prices is locked in the files
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ko sadan main bataanaa chahie ki aakhir vah koun se raaj hai
 The Congress said that the Defense Ministry officials and the Negotiation Team had raised questions about corruption in the prices of Rafael, but Modi rejected all those objections and dumped them in the trash and was allowed to loot the money of the country
 yah tamaam chijen rafel kii filon main ujagar hui hai
 Prime Minister Modi increased the price of Rafale from 526 crores to 1600 crores rupees
 sarkaar yah bataae ki keemten kyon badhaai gayi
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala also claimed that the Defense Ministry head of the finance Sudhanshu Mohanty and the Negotiation Team have objections to the files
 us par piem modi chup kyon hai? desh ke rajasav ko chuunaa kyon lagaaya gaya? paisa pehle de diya gaya or delivery ai nahin
 Not only this, the Law Ministry also questioned that there is neither a bank guarantee nor any autonomous guarantee
 unhone kaha ki tatkaaleen raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne bhi is puure maamle par raay dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Surjewala alleges that the Rafale aircraft that the UPA government was buying at cheap prices were bought at expensive prices because of a huge scam
 chaukeedaar chor he or desh ke rajasav ko ghaataa pahunchaaya gaya
 JPC should be investigated: Other senior Congress leaders - Ghulam Nabi Azad and Mallikarjun Kharge - have also questioned the Rafael Deal, saying that the Congress Party and Congress President Rahul Gandhi have been questioning that there is a big scam in it
 puri daal hi kaali he or isaki jaanch ke liye jepisi honi chahie
 So that milk milk can be water water
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki yah duniya or desh kaa sabase bada raksha ghotaalaa he, jisamen pradhanmantri or sarkaar uskaa hissaa he
 There is a scam of several thousand crores in it
 yah aam logon kaa paisa he jo ki unke tex ke dwaara diya jaataa he
 The Prime Minister and the government tried to cover up the scandal and tried to suppress it, but it is a volcano that will become an important issue in the midst of elections
