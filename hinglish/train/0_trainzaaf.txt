 However, this campaign of Virbhadra Singh, who has indicated that he should wear a dress of sannyas, considers political observers to be part of the Chief Minister's strategy to pressure Delhi to do things in his favor
 jaisaa ki ek vishleshak kehete hai, ''congress party ko bhi maaloom he ki virbhadra ke bina bhartiya janata party ke liye red karpet bichaane ke samaan hoga

 Monty Chadha, son of up's prominent liquor businessman Ponty Chadha, has been arrested on charges of cheating Rs 100 crore
 uske khilaaf lukout circular pehle hi jari kar diya gaya tha
 After the death of father Ponty Chadha in 2012, Monty Chadha took over the business
 ponti ne jinda rahete hue hi use kaarobaar kaa sabak dena shuru kar diya tha
 Monty Chadha's name came in the news at that time
 jab usne pita kii hatya ke baad kaarobaar sambhala
 It was November 17, 2012
 jab chaddha parivaar ko bada jhatka laga tha
 On that day there was a bloody clash between Ponty and his brother Hardeep at the farm house in Delhi
 jisamen unki maut ho gai thi
 There was no outsider responsible for his death
 wo apane hi chote bhai hardip ke saath golibari main maare gaye the
 59-year-old liquor businessman Gurdeep Singh Chadha aka Ponty Chadha had probably already realized that something was going to happen to him
 bataaya jaataa he ki agast 2011 main unki kundali dekhakar dilli ke ek jyotishi ne ek 'kaale saaye' ke bare main chetaya tha
 He also advised Ponty to quit the liquor business
 darasal, ye sharaab hi thi jisane muradabad ke ek maamuli-se rehadi vaale ko itani oonchai par pahunchaa diya ki uttar pradesh ke 80 fisadi sharaab kaarobaar par uskaa kabja ho gaya tha
 But on the afternoon of 17 November, the same liquor became the death of Ponty and his brother Hardeep at Delhi's No
 42 Central Drive Farm House
 darasal, ponti or unke bhaiyon ke bich bantwaaraa hona tha
 Ponty's mother Prakash Kaur and the elders of the family wanted the whole family to sit together one day and settle the property dispute between the two brothers
 unke bich chini milon se lekar distilleri, saarvajanik parivahan or real estate ko milakar kareeb 20,000 karod rupee ke samooche kaarobaari samrajya kaa bantwaaraa hona tha
 But in the coffin of this dispute, the 42-acre farmhouse of Chhatarpur spread over just three acres, became the last nail
 teenon bhaaiyon ke bich daraaren to pehle hi pad chuki thi
 His father Kulwant Singh Chadha wanted the three brothers to be divided without any dispute
 lekin is maamle main sabase chote hardip urf satnam ko pareshaani thi
 However, the pair of both elder brothers Ponty and Raju (rajinder) were confirmed
 un donon kii ek baat thi
 Before Diwali in November, Ponty got Raju's daughter married in Istanbul
 magar hardip usamen nahin gaye the
 Manpreet Singh Chadha alias Monty Chadha's business journey Manpreet Singh Chadha alias Monty Chadha, who lives a life of a proud life like his father, would hardly have thought that he would lose his father at the age of just 30
 use ahsaas bhi nahin tha ki wo itani jaldi pita ke samrajya kaa vaaris ban jayega
 Monty may not have thought this, but perhaps Ponty had already made preparations to hand over the throne to his son
 march 2012 main jab uttar pradesh main satta parivartan hua to akhilesh yadav ke shapath grahan samaaroh main ponti apane saath bete monti ko lekar aae the
 Monty, like his father, is a school dropout and like him, he specializes in juggling with leaders and officers
 april 2012 main ajtak / india today ko die ek saakshaatkaar main ponti chaddha ne kaha tha ki unke bete kii sharaab kaarobaar main dilchaspee nahin he
 But, according to experts, Monty was involved in making inroads in the liquor business for the last one year as well as making inroads among political masters of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand
 monti pehle se hi parivaar kii pramukh company wave ink ke joint managing diarector the or kaarobaar ke bade hisse ko sambhaal rahe the
 Monty had demonstrated his business ambitions during his father's time, when he announced two large real estate projects in Noida and Ghaziabad at a cost of Rs 4,000 crore
 mahaj 19 lakh ru
 Monty surprised the real estate giants by announcing a flat in Noida-like area
 unke pita ne jahaan sharaab ke baar kholkar paisa banaaya vahiin monti sharaab ke saath chikan baar laane kaa bhi iraadaa rakhte the
 They wanted to bring such machines from Israel for their poultry business that had twice the capacity of the machines in the country
 lekin neshnal hive 24 par aane vaale ek bade project ne unki jindagi main tufaan laa diya
 a 100 crore fraud case was registered against him with the investors of that project
 yahi nahin unke khilaaf lukout circular bhi jari kiya gaya tha
 Since then he was in trouble

 India did not deal with the rcep's deal with Cansil
 The trust on many issues could grow in the market
 China's trade India has decided not to be a part of the RCEP trade agreement of 16 countries
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke is faisle kii satta paksh to tarif kar hi rahaa he, vahiin vipaksh bhi ise apni jeet bataa rahaa he
 However, PM Modi has stated India's interests behind not joining this agreement
 piem modi ne kaha he, 'RCEP samjhaute kaa maujuuda swaroop buniyadi bhaavana or maanya maardarshak siddhanton ko puri tarah jaahir nahin karata he
 It also does not satisfactorily address India's long-standing issues and concerns in the current situation
 ' aise main ye sawaal bhi uth rahe hai ki bharat ko RCEP samjhaute main shaamil hone se kya nuksaan hone vaale the
 For these reasons, India is being drawn out that India could not get confidence on many issues in the discussion on RCEP
 inamen aayaat main badhotaree se hone vaale aparyaapt sangrakshan, RCEP sadsy deshon ke saath 105 billian dollar kaa vyapaar ghaataa, bazaar pahunch par bharose kii kami, non-tarriff pratibandhon par asahmati or niyamon ke sambhavit ulanghan shaamil hai
 China is the biggest reason for this
 -darasal, is samjhaute se baahar hone kaa sabase bada kaaran china se aayaat bataaya ja rahaa he
 If India had reached the RCEP agreement, there would have been a flood of cheap Chinese goods in the Indian market
 -RCEP yani kshetreey vyapak aarthik bhagidaari main 10 asian deshon ke alaava 6 anya desh australia, china, bharat, japan, newjiland or dakshin korea bhi shaamil hai
 Free trade between the compromising countries is promoted
 lihaaja, bharat ke samjhaute main shaamil hone se china ko bhartiya bazaar main pair pasaarne kaa acha mauka mil jaataa
 - India has more imports than exports with countries involved in RCEP
 samjhaute ke tahat aisi koi vyavastha nahin he jisase agar aayaat badhata he to use niyantrit kiya ja sake
 That is, the situation was not clear when China or any other country's goods were allowed in a substantial proportion in the Indian market
 -is samjhaute main shaamil deshon ko ek-duusare ko vyapaar main tex katautee samet tamaam aarthik chhot deni hogi
 But the agreement does not include any good faith promise of non-tariff restrictions
 -RCEP main jo desh shaamil hai, unke saath bharat kaa vyapaar bhi phydemand nahin rahaa he
 The fiscal deficit for the past year has been $ 105 billion
 yani is lihaaj se bhi bharat ke liye yah samjhauta mufeed nahin tha
 RCEP was being opposed in India for all these reasons
 vipakshi congress se lekar majdoor sanghathan bhi isaki mukhaalafat kar rahe the, jiske baad modi sarkaar ne aantarik hiton kaa hawala dete hue khud RCEP se baahar kar liya
 Maulana Noorur Rahman Barkati, the royal imam of Tipu Sultan Mosque in Kolkata, continues to be a bully
 unke khilaaf apmanjanak tippaniyon or kanoon kii andekhi ke liye teen alag-alag shikaayatein police main darj ho chuki hai
 But despite this, they do not have any effect
 shuukravaar ko barkati ne doharaaya ki wo centre sarkaar ke bain ke baavjood apane vaahan par laal batti lagaana jari rakhenge
 When India Today questioned Barkati on the illicit use of lights, he turned back angrily and said, "why are you so worried about my red light? "barkati ne kaha, "kisi main meri laal batti hataane kii himmat nahin he
 It has been with us for thousands of years
 ye RSS he jo avaidh he
 Modi is illegal, not my car's red light
 "barkati kaa ye jawaab unke khilaaf police main kai shikaayat darj hone ke ek din baad aayaa he
 These complaints are against the illegal use of red lights and making inflammatory speeches
 ye shikaayatein alag alag vyaktiyon kii ore se kolkata ke topasia or gariyahat, haavda ke golabari police stesan main darj kii gai hai
 Rajarshi Lahiri, a complainant, said, "first they made a fatwa against the Prime Minister
 aaj bhi kaha ki koi bhi unke vaahan kii laal batti ko nahin hataa saktaa
 Therefore, we have asked the police to arrest them and take action according to the law of the country
 "ek shikayatakarta ne kaha, "unke iradatan bhadakaau bhaashan sampradayik tanaav ko badhaava dene vaale or sauhaard ko bigaadane vaale hai
 "on the other hand, despite all the criticisms, Barkati continues with his old stand
 barkati ne kaha, "meraa aparaadh kya he? mujhe kyon giraftaar kiya jaae
 Just because i speak the truth
 kisi main itnaa dam he (mujhe giraftaar karne kaa)
 
 
 I'm not afraid "shuukravaar kobijepi yuva morchake samarthakon ne barkati kii tatkaal giraftaar ke liye central kolkata main pradarshan kiya
 The protesters accused Barkati of making anti-india statements
 aisa hi virodh pradarshan bijepi samarthakon ne haavda main kiya
 The effigy of Barkati was also burnt there
 barkati ne kaha, "agar mere saath is tarah kaa bartaav ho saktaa he to sochie desh bhar menmuslimon ke sathkya hota hoga
 They want to make India a Hindu nation
 yaa to main is desh main rahoonga yaa RSS
 " dilli main guuruuvaar raat phir ek ladki se balaatkaar kii koshish hui

 Music shouted at the girl's screaming and tried to rape
 isi dauraan ladki bahaduree dikhaate hue car se neeche kud gai
 However, the girl's leg falls under the car and she is badly injured
 gauratlab he ki cabinet ne mahilaon ke khilaaf hone vaale aparaadhon ko rokane se judaa aapraadhik kanoon sanshodhan vidheyak ko manjuuri de di he
 Earlier, there was an opinion in the Group of Ministers on reducing the age of sex from 18 years to 16 years with consent
 yon utpeedan kii jagah vidheyak main balaatkaar shabd kaa hi istemaal hoga, yani peedit har surat main mahila hi hogi
 This demand was especially from women's organizations
 iske alaava peechha karne or chhip kar dekhne jaise muddon ko gaiyr jamaanti aparaadhon ke daayre main daalaa gaya he
 In this case there is no provision for punishment in case of false complaint

 The festival of faith Kumbh (kumbh2019) is not only important for the people living in the country but it is so important that people come to India every time from across the seven seas to participate in it
 is baar prayagraj main chal rahe kumbh (kumbh2019)main australia se aae sarvangagiri baba sabakaa dhyaan khinch rahe hai
 The special thing is that before coming to India in 1998, Sarvangagiri Baba was an atheist
 melbern main paley-bade ye baba pehle bas yoga karte the phir bharat aakar sanathan dharm se vaafiq hue or ab dharm-karm main ram gaye hai
 After coming to India, he got education from Guru Guru Mangalagiri
 baba ke anusaar shuru main unhen hindi samajhane main dikkat ai lekin aadhyatm raas aa gaya
 This is the reason that now he has come for bathing Kumbh (kumbh2019) for the tenth time
 gauratlab he ki prayagraj main pehle shahi snaan (kumbh First Shahi Snan) ke saath hi ardh kumbh meley (kumbh2019) kii shuruyaat 15 janvari ko hui thi
 The royal procession of saints and saints was first taken out in the fair, after which the tradition of royal bathing started

 This religious-spiritual-cultural fair (kumbh 2019) will attract more than 15 crore devotees from India and abroad for the next 45 days

 " The Rajasthan government amended the plan to allot residential land at a discounted rate to Hindu displaced families from Pakistan, a day before the election code of conduct was enacted
 nai yojana ke tahat pakistan se aae hindu visthapit parivaar ab pradesh main kahin bhi riyayati dar par awasaiya jameen kharid sakegaa
 Urban Housing and Development Minister of Rajasthan Shri Chand Kripalani said that the state government will allot residential land to Hindu displaced families through lottery
 isse 200-250 visthapit pakistani hindu pariwaron ko phayda hoga
 These families will be allotted land at a 25 percent concessional rate from the reserve rate
 shahari awaas evam vikaas vibhaag ne is varsh may main visthapit pakistani hindu pariwaron ko bhoomi aavanton ke liye ek niti banaai thi, jisamen haal hi main 5 oktober ko ek circular ke jariye sanshodhan kiya gaya he
 The policy has been amended following memorandum given to the department by various organizations to change the policy
 shahari awaas evam vikaas vibhaag ke sanyukt sachiv rajendra singh shekhavat ne bataaya ki isse purv niti ke anusaar visthapit pakistani hindu pariwaron ko jis jile main naagarikta di gai thi vahiin awasaiya bhoomi aavanton kaa praavdhaan tha

 dilli main ‘purna rajya ke darje’ kii maang ko lekar rajya kaa siyaasi paara badha hua he
 Regarding this demand, a series of allegations against the three political parties in Delhi is going on
 aam aadmi party (aap) ne apane ghoshnaa-patr main dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dilaane kaa vaada kiya he
 The Aam Aadmi Party is contesting the 2019 Lok Sabha elections on the basis of its demand for full statehood status to Delhi

 Prabhash Giri, a lawyer by profession, says that being the national capital, some of the arrangements and security aspects here are the responsibility of the central government and Article 239AA of the constitution gives it the legal right to control these issues
 yahaan ek taraf to ek chuni hui vidhansabha or sarkaar he, vahiin duusari taraf samvidhan kaa anuchhed 239ee is sarkaar ke adhikaron main katautee karata he
 In view of this situation, the demand of giving Purna state status to Delhi does not seem legitimate
 vahiin buraadi ke gaanv natthoopura ke indra mohan singh kehete he kejariwal kaa dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene kii maang ekadam jaij he
 The reason is clear that until Delhi government gets the rights like police and land acquisition, then the issues like development and security of Delhi will continue to be hindered
 vahiin najafagarh ke dhasa gaanv ke ram avatar sharma kehete hai ki dilli sarkaar ke aadhin police karnaa vyavhaarik rup se sahi nahin he
 The reason for this is that the President, Prime Minister, Foreign Embassy and foreign leaders visit in Delhi
 unki suraksha kisi rajya sarkaar ko kaise saunpi ja sakati he
 On the other hand, Chaudhary Khajan Singh of Kair village in Najafgarh says that till the AAP and the BJP government came to power in Delhi, the state and central governments here have been resolving all the issues through dialogue and agreement among themselves
 lekin beete teen-chaar saalon main yah sthiti puri tarah badal chuki he
 Now there is always a situation of confrontation between the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief Minister

 It is evident that Delhi Police, being the capital of the country and being the stronghold of VVIP, is under high alert
 didie par kabja panaap kii sabase badi manshaa didie par adhikaar paane kii bhi he
 The issue of land is the biggest in this, because many major decisions of the Delhi government are not complete due to lack of land

 In the recent period, after the demonetisation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there is a strong effort to increase the trend of cashless transactions across the country
 iske liye kendra sarkaar ne ap aadhaarit transfars ke liye kai raste taiyaar karne kii koshish bhi kii he
 The government has asked rupay, mastercard and Visa to prepare a payment solution based on the Common Quick Response Code (QR)
 is suvidha kii shuruyaat ke baad desh bhar ke dukandaaron or vyapaariyon ko bina card swip mashin ke electronic pement hasil ho sakegi
 In such a situation it becomes even more important to know how this quick response code will work
 ap scanning se honge tranjactions
 
 
 The merchant or shopkeeper will show the QR code to any customer
 ise roope, mastercard or vija jaise pement networks ke ap se scan kiya ja sakegaa
 After this, the customer can easily transfer any amount to the shopkeeper's account
 is tarah ke QR code aadhaarit pement ke liye debit yaa phir credit card kii koi jarurat nahin hogi
 Currently such facilities are available through Paytm but under this, both the shopkeeper and the customer must have this app
 yahi vajah he ki petm kisi duusare pement network ko sweekaar nahin karata he
 Money will be transferred through other apps as well
 
 
 haalanki sarkaar kii ore se prastaavit is pement system main duusare eps ke madhyam se bhidhanrashi transfarki ja sakegi
 The idea of working on such a common QR code came up during a meeting between banks, payment companies and government officials led by Government of India Minister Piyush Goyal on this issue
 is prachlit QR aadhaarit pement solution ko philhal india QR kaha ja rahaa he
 It is planned to be launched by January
 QR code pements ke maamle main vija he awwal
 
 
 In the case of transactions based on QR codes, Visa is considered to be the top
 isane saal bhar pehle bangaleru main 'em vija' kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Significantly, m Visa is used for payment in all markets across the world
 haal hi main mastercard ne bhi QR sarvice suvidha kii shuruyaat kii he
 Apart from this, Rupe is also going to launch such a feature soon
 sarkaar kaa he teesraa morcha
 
 
 This is the third front

 BJP leaders are also acknowledging with a suppressed impression that the BJP has managed to win for the sixth time, but has not been able to do much better in the villages
 gramin kshetron ke logon or kisaanon main faile asantosh ko party samay rahete behatar tareeke se nipataara kar leti to rajya kii siyaasi tasviir main bijepi or bhi achche nattejey laa sakati thi
 Apart from this, the BJP has also suffered some loss due to caste movements
 saurashtra ke vikaas par focusasaurashtra bijepi kaa paramparaagat kshetra rahaa he
 In 1995, the BJP was seated on state power for the first time with the help of this region
 54 siton main se 44 siten jeetne main wo safal rahi thi, lekin is baar bijepi kaa ye durg darka he
 The Congress won 29 seats while dodging and BJP got 25 seats
 aise main bijepi ke aalaa netaa saurashtra ke logon kii naaraazgi dur karne ke liye ranneeti bana rahe hai
 Through this, problems of farmers will be diagnosed
 industry ke saath-saath krishi nitiyon par bhi bijepi sarkaar mukhya focus karegi
 During the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP promised to double the income of farmers
 modi sarkaar ko ab is disha main or jorshor se prayaas karne honge
 Keeping the caste balance in mind, the BJP has managed to win the Gujarat elections, but its caste equation is breached
 bijepi jaateey sameekaran saadhane ke liye apane paramparaagat votbank patidaar ko waapas laane or obisi ko ekajute banaae rakhane ke disha main ranneeti bana rahi he
 The new BJP government and the party will work towards resolving dissent spread in the villages as well as reaching out to different communities
 sutron ke mutabik pradhanmantri modi ne gujarat main khud halaat kaa jayja lene kaa faisla kiya he, taaki gavarnence ko unke siem ke kaarykaal jaisaa sakht or asardaar banaaya ja sake
 Avoiding steps like demonetisation and GST, urban votes have played an important role in putting BJP on the throne of power for the sixth time in Gujarat
 vyapaaree bijepi kaa kor votbank maane jate hai
 He has laid the foundation of victory for the BJP even after consuming the bitter gulp of demonetisation and GST
 aise main bijepi ab bache hue kaarykaal main is tarah ke kathor kadam uthaane se bachate hue najar aegi

 His stardom, which began in the 70s, continues unabated today
 apane daur main unke saamne bahut zyada actor aseemit safalataa hasil nahin kar paae or kahin naa kahin is list menrajnikantka bhi naam liya ja saktaa he
 Actually, many of the films of the 70-80 era of South Cinema, which are given the status of classic today, were remakes of Amitabh's films
 khud rajnikant das se adhishmitabh bachchanaki rimek kii gai south kii filmon main lead bhoomika nibhaakar apana kariyar sanvaarane main kaamyaab rahe
 Rajinikanth also did many films in Bollywood but he could not leave his special impact in this industry
 vahiin ve amitabh ke saath kii gai filmon main bhi khaas prabhaavshaalee nahin rahe
 However, his stardom still rings in the South Industry
 dashakon baad bhi aaj bhi phens unki film ke aane par jashn manaate hai lekin bollywood main unhen lekar aisa paagalpan nahin he

 donon artists karte hai ek duusare kaa sammansulajhe hue artists kii tarah hi donon ek duusare kii kaaphi izzat karte hai or ek duusare kaa bahut sammaan karte hai
 Both of them do not have any kind of arrogance about their stardom and both artists enjoy stardom even today, but it is clear that Rajinikanth has failed to give his stardom very much in Bollywood

 Reserve Bank of India Governor d Subbarao said today that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a better indicator of accessing inflation data than the Wholesale Price Index (WPI)

 The fact that consumer price is better than wholesale price reflects demand side pressure
 ise vistaar se bataate hue subbarao ne kaha ki thok mulyon main nirantar vruddhi se yaa to retailor daam badha dete hai yaa phir unke margin par asar padataa he
 But if demand is strong, retailers can pass on the burden of increasing wholesale prices to customers
 vahiin yadi maang kamjor he, to retailleron ko thok mulyon kaa boj apane margin par hi daalana hoga

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the time has come to take tough decisions and the countrymen should not be misled by those who once again want to spread fear like 1991
 khudara kaarobaar main pratyaksh videshi nivesh, dijal ke daam badhaane or saste gas silendar kii aapurti simit karne jaise faislon ko uchit tehraate hue pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha ki niveshkon kaa vishwaas behaal karne ke liye kathin faisle lenaa jaruri hai
 In the message given to the nation, Singh said that the concerns related to allowing FDI in retail are unfounded as there is enough scope for small and large retailers to move forward
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki 1991 main jab vitt mantri ke rup main unhone aarthik sudhaar shuru kiye tab bhi isi tarah kaa bhay failaayaa gaya tha
 He said that those who spread such fear were not successful even then and still could not succeed
 dijal ke daam badhaane or saste alpiji silendar kii sankhya salanaa chah tak simit karne ke faisle ko sahi tehraate hue unhone kaha ki kathin aarthik halaat or rajkoshiya ghate ko badhane se rokane ke liye aisa karnaa jaruri tha kyonki aisa nahin hone par aavashyak vastuon kii keemat main betahasha vruddhi hoti
 Singh said that no government wants to burden the common man, but it is also the responsibility of the government to protect the interests of the nation and safeguard the long-term future of its people
 unhone kaha ki varsh 1991 main hamane isi tarah kii samasya kaa saamana kiya tha
 No one was willing to give us even a small loan, but due to strong and strong steps, we came out of that crisis
 aap un kadamon ke sakaaratmak nattejey dekh sakate hai
 He said that today the situation is not like that, but before the public's trust is lifted from our economy, we must take action
 singh ne kaha ki sarkaar aise mode par he, jahaan vah vikaas kii mand gati ko palat sakati he
 We have to revive investor confidence both domestically and globally
 is uddeshy se ve faisle karne jaruri the, jo hamane pichley dinon kiye
 The Prime Minister strongly favors the government in a 15-minute address to the nation in the context of a tornado across the country to allow FDI in multibrand retail, increase diesel prices by five rupees and limit the number of subsidized LPG cylinders Kept
 lage raho munnabhai, 3 idiyat or pike jaisi filmon main yadi samanta khoji jaae to shaayad hi koi is baat se asahmat ho ki in filmon kii jaan swanand kirakire ke likhe gane hai
 Their songs are just loud on first listen and then we start looping in everyone's phones and computers
 jo ab tak teen baar rashtriya film puraskaar jeet chuke hai
 They write songs while talking through the winds
 
 
 geetkaar or sangeetkaar apana best nikaalane ke liye na jane kya-kya karte hai
 Here let us tell you that Swanand Kirkire has traveled for hours in the best buses of Mumbai in order to write songs for the film Parineeta
 ve taaji hawa main gane likhane par apana best de pate hai
 He still writes songs sitting in his car and uses copy and pen instead of computer keypad
 unke geet aatma ko choote hai
 
 
 Whoever has listened to the songs written by them, it is just theirs
 chaahe o ri chiraiya ho yaa phir baavaraa man ho
 The songs written by him seem to be unguided and apne
 ek aisa geetkaar jo hamaari ankahi ko khubsuurati se bayaan kar detaa he
 It adds strength to sorrow and just dissolves in life on the occasion of happiness

 amit shah ne panchayat se lekar sansad tak bhaajapa ko satta main laane ke sapane ko saakaar karne kii disha main patibaddh pahal kii
 After taking over as BJP President in July 2014, he toured the entire country for the expansion of the BJP and worked to awaken the party workers
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki shah ne vichaardhaara kii dridhtaa, aseemit raajnneetik kalpanashiltaa or vaastavik raajnneetik lacheelepan kaa shandaar mishran karke chunavi samar main bhaajapa kii shandaar jeet kaa maarg prashast kiya
 In Bihar and Maharashtra, he not only took a flexible approach to alliance with the NDA constituents but also carried out a strategy of bringing the vote bank of the rival parties to his party
 iske alaava tamilanadu or kerala jaise rajyon main bhi gathbandhan kiya
 The results of the alliance in the Northeast have clearly come to the fore
 chunaav prabandhan ke khilaadi shah ne pehali baar 1991 ke loksabhaa chunaav main gandhinagar main bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani kaa chunaav prabandhan sambhala tha
 However, the charisma of his booth management was reflected in the 1995 by-election when the election management of Yatin Ojha, the lawyer contesting against the then Deputy Chief Minister Narhari Amin on the Sabarmati assembly seat, was handed over to him
 khud yatin kehete hai ki shah ko raajnneeti ke sivaa or kuch nahin dikhataa
 His close friends say that he spends very little time in family and social harmony
 shah ko kaaryakartaaon kii acchhee parakh he or vah sanghathan va prabandhan ke maahir khilaadi hai
 Shah tried his luck in the 1997 assembly by-election from Sarkhej for the first time and since 2012, he was elected MLA for five consecutive terms
 sarkhez kii jeet ne unhen gujarat main yuva or tejatarraar netaa ke rup main sthapit kiya
 After that victory, he continued to climb stairs in the BJP
 modi ke gujarat ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad shah or adhik majbootee se ubhare
 From 2003 to 2010, he held the Ministry of Home Affairs in the Gujarat Government Cabinet
 haalanki unhen is bich kai siyaasi utaar-chadhaavon kaa saamana karnaa padaa, lekin jab narendra modi ko rashtriya raajnneetik patal par laayaa gaya to unke sabase kareebi maane jane vaale amit shah ko bhi puure desh main bhaajapa ke prachaar prasar main shaamil kiya gaya
 In Uttar Pradesh, he also proved his political ability by winning 71 out of 80 seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 tripura vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bhaajapa kii kamyaabi ke peeche shah kii ranneeti ko mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections too, he formed around 500 election committees across the country and deployed around 7000 leaders
 unhone party ke chunaav abhiyaan main aisi 120 siton par khaas dhyaan diya jahaan bhaajapa pehle chunaav nahin jeet paayi thi
 He deployed 3000 full-time workers to run the party's campaign

 Babur had built the temple in the Supreme Court, Rajiv Dhawan said, 'not sure of the Gazetteer before 1855' Ayodhya land dispute case is going on in the Supreme Court
 supreme court kii samvidhan peeth ke saamne 28wein din kii sunwaayee ke dauraan muslim paksh ke vakil rajeev dhawan ne babarnama kaa hawala diya
 Rajiv Dhawan said that Babur built the temple there
 hindu pakshakaar to gajetir kaa hawala apni suvidha ke mutabik de rahe hai, lekin gajetir kai alag alag samay par alag najariye se jari hue the
 Hence, it cannot be said directly that Babur broke the temple and built a mosque
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki justise agarwal ke is vichaar se bhi ittefaq nahin rakhaa ja saktaa, jo kahin report ko maan rahe hai or kahin nahin
 On this, Justice Bobde asked that in some old mosques, there is something found in Sanskrit, how is that? Answering this question, Rajiv Dhawan said that because the workers who made the artisans were Hindus, they used to build buildings in their own way
 banane kaa kaam shuru karne se pehle wo vishwakarma or anya tarah kii puja bhi karte the or kaam puraa hone ke baad yaadgaar ke taur par kuch lekh bhi ankit karte the

 unhone kaha ki doosraa paksh gajetir or babarnam kaa chuninda hisson ko hi adaalat main pesh kar rahe hai

 Many times we are not able to present ourselves properly to others, due to which we have to face many problems
 aatmavishvaas kii kami hone ke kaaran apni baat ko dusron ke saamne majbootee se nahin rakh pate hai, natijatan apane liye hi pareshaani bad jaati he
 Something similar happened with a friend of mine
 offis main uske ek saathi apana sara kaam juniurs ke upar chhodkar achaanak chuttee le lete hai
 In such a situation, the pressure of work increases on her, she gets stressed under the pressure of completing a lot of work in a short time
 offis main aapasi manmutav se bachane ke liye vah is bare main kuch baat nahin karti
 Circumstances of this kind would come before everyone
 in paristhiyon se bachane ke liye jarurat he aatmavishvaas kii, kuch choti-choti baton kaa dhyaan rakhkar ham is tarah ke tanaav se batch sakate hai
 In order to deal with such situations, it is important that we keep our point firmly in front of others
 lekin iske saath hi is baat kaa bhi khyaal rakhen ki apni baat samajhaate hue ham dusron kii garima ko thes naa pahunchaae
 By learning the art of putting your face in front of others with patience and perseverance, the person in front of us will be able to understand and be compelled to obey
 kuch in baton ko dhyaan main rakhkar ham sikh sakate hai aisi kisi bhi paristhiti se nipatane kaa gur
 
 
 Practice talking - If you lack confidence, then practice talking in front of the mirror
 phir apana body language dekhe or aankh main aankh daalkar baat karne kaa abhyaas karen
 Keep this process of talking in your mind and keep repeating it
 - ham aksar baat karne se pehle saamne vaale kii pratikriya ke bare main sochate hai, kahin use bura to nahin lagegaa, use gussa to nahin aayega, wo hamaare liye kya sochega
 
 lekin hakeekat yah he ki agar ham aatmavishvaas or dridhtaa se baat karenge to saamne vaala hamaari baat ko samajhegaa bhi or aapaki izzat bhi karegaa
 Consider others to be equal: Before putting your point of view in front of others or in any conversation, keep in mind that no one is better than you or someone is less than you
 saamne vaali kii baat puri sunen, unki baton kii saraahna karen or usee dauraan apni baat bhi itmeenaan se kahen or unase kahen ki unka kahana bhi thik he lekin aapkaa najariya thodaa alag he
 Say it politely but clearly Many times during a conversation your voice or your tone of speech reflects your excitement
 baat karte vakt dhyaan rakhen ki aap saamne vaale kaa majaak nahin bana rahe hai, khaastaur par tab jab aap samooh main hai
 Keep in mind that no one would want to be disrespected, especially in front of others

 maharashtra main bijepi ab bhi uddhav thakare or raaj thakare ke bich hichkole kha rahi he
 The political atmosphere of the state got so hot after the meeting of former BJP president Nitin Gadkari and Raj Thackeray at a hotel in Mumbai yesterday that Uddhav Thackeray called state BJP president Devendra Fadnavis to his house and clarified the party's stance about Maharashtra Navnirman Sena Asked to do
 maharashtra kii 48 siton main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan is baar kam se kam 30 siten jeetna chahta he
 BJP has taken initiative for this
 party ne rajya main ek mahayuti yani bada gathbandhan banane kii koshish kii he
 It consists of five parties
 ye hai bijepi, shivasena, ramdaas athavle kii arpiai (e), raju shetty kaa swabhimaan shetakari sanghathan or mahadev jhankaar kii arsapi
 The BJP made several compromises to form an alliance
 usne ramdaas athavle ko rajya sabha bhi bhej diya he, apane jujharu netaa prakaash jaavdekar kii daavedaari ko nazarandaaz kar
 But without Raj Thackeray, can it really be called Mahayuti? bijepi ko lagata he ki jab tak raaj thakare uske saath nahin aate, tab tak congress-ensipi gathbandhan ko dhul chataane kaa uskaa sapana puraa nahin ho saktaa
 But the biggest problem in taking Raj along is the opposition of Uddhav Thackeray
 bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke raaj thakare ke saath behad mitraapurna sambandh hai or ye shivasena ko raas nahin aata
 Uddhav Thackeray has been uneasy about Modi's candidature
 shivasena supremeo bal thakare ne iske liye ek baar sushamaa swaraj kaa naam liya tha
 The reason given was that he did not want Modi to interfere in his politics in the name of Hindutva in Maharashtra
 vaise ab modi kii ummidavaari ko uddhav kaa samarthan he
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Raj Thackeray showed his strength by damaging the bjp-shiv Sena alliance
 kam se kam das lok sabha siten aisi hai jahaan emenes ne bijepi-shivasena ke vot kaat kar congress yaa ensipi ko jeetne main madad kii
 Take for example the Mumbai South Lok Sabha seat
 yahaan se congress-ensipi ke ummidavaar milind devda ko 272411 vot mili jabaki bijepi-shivasena ke ummidavaar mohan rawale ko 146118 vot
 MNS candidate Bala Nandgaonkar got 159729 votes
 yani agar bijepi-shivasena-emenes ke vot mila die jaaen to ye kareeb teen lakh hote hai
 In this sense, Milind Deora could also lose this seat
 lok sabha chunaav main raaj thakare kii party kaa asar mumbai dakshin, mumbai dakshin madhya, mumbai uttar madhya, mumbai uttar pashchim mumbai uttar pashchim, mumbai uttar, nasik, bhiwandi, thane or pune jaisi siton par khaastaur se dekhne ko mila tha
 The MNS received more than one lakh votes in these ten seats and the bjp-shiv Sena alliance lost all these seats
 is lok sabha chunaav main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ko 29 fisadi vot mili
 But if Raj Thackeray were together, this alliance could have reached 33 percent
 chah maheene baad hue vidhansabha chunaav main raaj thakare kii party ne saadhe chaar fisadi vot lekar 13 siten jeetin
 Now 2009 seems ready to repeat itself once again
 is baar bijepi-shivasena kii dikkat ye he ki unke voton main send lagane ke liye raaj thakare ke saath aam aadmi party bhi chunaav maidan main he
 There is a possibility that Arvind Kejriwal's party may get a fair amount of votes in areas such as Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur
 ye vahi siten hai jinhen congress-ensipi se chhine bina bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan apni takat nahin badha paaegaa
 That is why if Raj Thackeray is seen not only contesting the Lok Sabha elections but also supporting Modi, then bjp-shiv Sena alliance can benefit
 lekin isaki keemat bijepi ko hi chukaani padegi
 Raj Thackeray can be given 35 to 40 seats for the assembly elections
 lekin, zaahir he shivasena apane hisse se dene ke liye iske liye shaayad hi taiyaar ho
 That is, the BJP may have to compromise on this too
 sawaal ye bhi he ki shivasena aise kisi bhi samjhaute ko hari jhandi degi yaa nahin? uddhav ne kal jaise tikhe tevar dikhaae hai use dekh kar to yahi lagata he ki bijepi ko is samjhaute tak pahunchne main kaaphi mushkilen aa sakati hai
 After the Delhi gang rape, everyone remembers enacting strict laws against female harassment
 jabaki isi satr main 4 disambar ko jab loksabhaa main criminal lau amendament bill pesh kiya gaya to kisi kii us par nazar bhi nahin padi
 Now both the ruling and the opposition are making statements that a new law should be passed by passing this bill prepared against rape and other crimes against women
 buudhvaar ko bhi sansad main dilli ke samuhik balaatkaar kaa gussa dikhaa
 nda-affiliated women mps demanded a debate in the Lok Sabha
 idhar, bijepi ne kaha ki vah faujadaari kanoon sanshodhan bill 2012 main sanshodhan pesh karegi or balaatkaar ke liye faansee kii sazaa kii maang karegi
 Speaking to NDTV, BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu said that the current law has failed to stop rape cases and it has become necessary to punish the culprits more severely
 vaise isi satr main loksabhaa main pesh kiye gaye is bill main yon aparaadhon kii sazaa or kadi karne kii baat he
 If this bill is passed, there will be a minimum sentence of 7 years for sexual assaults
 tippaniyan If a police or government officer or a manager or officer using his / her position is found responsible for sexual assault, then he / she can have a minimum life span of ten years to life
 grih rajyamantri arpyen singh ne kaha ki sarkaar is bill ko paas karaane ke liye har sambhav pahal karegi
 However, Congress believes that hanging for rape is not good
 party kii pravaktaa renuka choudhary maanati hai ki faansee se behatar vikalp hai or unpar gambhirtha se vichaar hona chahie
 On Wednesday too, the gang rape of Delhi showed anger
 endie se judi mahila saansadon ne loksabhaa main is par bahes kii maang kii
 Here, the BJP said it would introduce amendments to the Criminal Law Amendment Bill 2012 and would demand capital punishment for rape
 enditivi se baatcheet main bijepi netaa vankeya naidu ne kaha ki maujuuda kanoon rape ke maamalon ko rokane main naakaam rahaa he or doshiyon ko or sakht sazaa dena zaruri ho gaya he
 By the way, this bill introduced in the Lok Sabha in this session, there is a matter of punishment and hardening of sexual offenses
 agar ye bill paas hua to yon hamalon ke liye kam se kam 7 saal kii sazaa hogi
 The comments agar yon hamale ke liye koi police yaa sarkari afasar yaa apni haisiyat kaa istemaal kar rahaa koi manager yaa adhikari zimmedaar paaya jaataa he to use kam se kam das saal kii bamashkkat qaid se lekar umraqaid tak ho sakati he
 Minister of State for Home RPN Singh said that the government will take every possible initiative to pass this bill
 haalanki congress kaa maananaa he ki balaatkaar ke liye faansee kii sazaa thik nahin
 Party spokesperson Renuka Chowdhury believes there are better options than hanging and should be seriously considered

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has now been taunted by Jharkhand leader and former Union Minister Subodh Kant Sahai
 sahay ne aaj tak se baatcheet main kaha kiraahul gandhi kii ranneeti spasht nahin he
 Their roles are being mixed
 sahay ne yah bhi kaha ki sonia gandhi ko aage aana chahie, vah congress kii sabase badi netaa hai
 Subodh Kant Sahai, while clarifying his stand on Rahul Gandhi brand politics, said that he is doing the social bridging work of our leader Rahul
 sahay ke mutabik congress kaa garibon se rishta tut gaya tha, rahul use jod rahe hai
 Sahay said, "sonamad should come forward," while chanting Sonia
 unke mutabik sonia ne hi rajeev gandhi ke sapane ko puraa karte hue jharkhand banaaya he
 Here is his mother Swaroop image
 rahul gandhi kii siyasat ke ghalmail par sahay bole, ‘vah abhi tak political ground par aae hi nahin hai
 He is an honest young leader
 garibon ke saath rishta jodna, unamem yakeen paidaa karnaa, yah kaam kar rahe hai
 But their roles are being mixed
 yaa to road par aaen yaa phir siddhant pratipaadit karen
 According to Sahai, Rahul Gandhi is not a strong leader
 garibon kii aawaaj hai
 But his clear projection is not happening in the party and the country
 haalanki aakhir main sahay yah bhi bole ki rahul gandhi ne jo siyaasi prayog kiye hai, unki koi sani nahin
 Criticism of Rahul in the Congress, which lost heavily in the Lok Sabha elections and lost power in several state elections, has started right away
 haal hi main maharashtra or haryana vidhansabha chunaavon main haar ke baad dilli main congress mukhyalay par rahul virdohi naare lage the
 Supporters had raised the slogans of Priyanka Gandhi, save Priyanka Gandhi, in support of Priyanka Gandhi
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav kaa antim charan shanivaar ko samaapt hone ke saath sabhi dal apni-apni sarkaar banane ke daawey kar rahe hai, lekin sarkaar kiski banegi, ye to chah march ko hi tay ho paaegaa
 However, according to political analysts, Uttar Pradesh is once again moving towards becoming the laboratory of political alliance
 kehete hai ki siyasat main koi kisi kaa sthaayee dushman yaa dost nahin hota
 Everyone sees the matter of their benefit
 chunaav se pehle samjhauta kisi or se hota he or baad main ve kisi or ke paale main khadey hote dikhaai dete hai
 This time only the Congress has entered into an agreement with the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) before the elections
 uskaa itihaas bhi haalanki avasarwaadi hi rahaa he
 In response to a question about the opportunism of RLD, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president Surya Pratap Shahi gave a strange answer
 unhone kaha, 'inkaa kya he, kal hamaare saath the or jab satta gai to sapa ke saath ho liye, ab congress ke saath hai
 Their condition is the same that whatever will fill their demand, they will become theirs'
 shahi ke is jawaab par ralod kii sahyogi dal congress kii pradesh adhyaksh reeta bahuguna joshi kahati hai, 'bhaajapa logon ko gumraah karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 The truth is that it will be confined within 50 seats
 iske alaava do anya pramukh dalon bahujan samaaj party (basapa) or samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke netaa bhi purna bahumat kii sarkaar banane ke daawey kar rahe hai
 They are also saying that if they do not get an absolute majority, they will sit in the opposition
 basapa ke mahasachiv satish chandra mishra majbootee ke saath apni sarkaar banane kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 He says, "BSP will also do well from its 2007 figure and under Mayawati's leadership we will again form a majority government"
 sapa ke pradesh mahasachiv ashok vaajapeyi bhi apni party kii sarkaar banane kaa kham thonk rahe hai or unhen bhi vishwaas he ki bina kisi kaa samarthan liye hi sapa kii sarkaar ban jaaegi
 He says, 'there is no doubt that SP is going to be the largest party and we will not need any other support
 ham apane dam par sarkaar banane main kaamyaab rahenge

 On the completion of four years of the Modi government, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has started reviewing the functioning of the central government and the BJP
 sangh se jude vibhinn sanghathanon or bijepi ke bich teen din chalane vaali samanvay baithak ke duusare din aaj sarkari vimaanan company air india ke vinievesh or petrol, dijal kii mahangaai kaa mudda uth saktaa he
 The meeting, to be chaired by RSS Joint General Secretary Krishna Gopal, is expected to be attended by BJP President Amit Shah, Finance and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal and Commerce and Industry and Civil Aviation Minister Suresh Prabhu
 baithak main bhartiya majdoor sangh,bhartiya kisaan sangh, laghu udyog bharatior swadeshi jaagran manch jaise sangh ke aarthik samooh apni report pesh karenge
 Apart from this, Modi will also give his feedback on various economic policies of the government
 sutron ke anusaar air india ke vinievesh or petrol, dijal ke daamon main kii gai badhottaree kaa mudda bhi baithak main uth saktaa he
 Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat had earlier categorically stated that Air India should not be sold to any foreign buyer
 bhartiya majdoor sangh or swadeshi jaagran manch bhi maujuuda tareeke se air india ke vinievesh kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 The platform says that Air India is making operating profits but due to heavy debt, it is running into losses
 manch ne suzav diya ki sarkaar ko is rashtriya vimaanan company ke karj kaa bhugtan karne ke liye uski sampattiyon kaa maudrikaran karnaa chahie
 Explain that the Modi government at the Center has invited 'letters of intent' from interested companies to sell 76 per cent stake and management control of Air India
 modi sarkaar kii air india main 100 fisadi bhagidaari he
 The government has put more than 23 thousand crore rupees capital into it since 2012 to help Air India recover from losses
 sarkaar kii ban rahi chhavi se chintit sanghasutron kaa kahana he ki sangh netritv sarkaar kii nitiyon ko lekar to santusht he, lekin uske kaamkaaj ko lekar janata main ban rahi dharna ko lekar chintit jarur he
 In order to change the perception of the government among the people, the Sangh will declare the social work of the government through its volunteers from the third week of June
 is sarkaar kaa remote control pradhanmantri modi ke paas he, isamen koi shaq nahin hai lekin sarkaar kii nitiyon or yojanaon kii samiksha sangh karata he ye kahana koi atishyokti hi hoga
 Whatever changes are made to the Modi government's plans and policies are based on the ground report of the organizations associated with the Sangh
 isse pataa chal saktaa he ki modi sarkaar or bijepi ke liye sangh kaa mahatv rakhata he
