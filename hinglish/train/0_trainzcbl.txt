 While investigating the case, the NIA has been saying that it has found only the bodies of four terrorists

 Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari is now facing this same fear
 pakistan ke raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ko dar sata he ki bharat or pakistan kii videsh nitishaaan aatankwaadi hamale kii vajah se badal naa jaae
 The foreign policy of peace between the two countries should not become a foreign policy of bitterness
 unhen dar sata he ki bharat auki pakistan ke rishton main kadavaahat gholne main aatankwaadi kaamyaab ho rahe hai
 Zardari saheb is also sad to see bitterness in the relationship, but why do you not see that the land on which terrorists plan to shed innocent blood in India is yours
 pakistan ke aakaa ko to ye baat samajni hi nahin hoti he
 These are the crocodile tears of Pakistan
 agar pakistan ko vaaki rishton me khatas kaa, mumbai main bekusron ke khun bahane kaa dard hota to mumbai hamale kii jaanch main pakistan sach kaa saath detaa, fareb kaa nahin
 However, the Foreign Minister of Pakistan is also not behind in shedding crocodile tears
 pakistan ke videshmantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne bhi ek taaja bayaan diya he ki bharat auki pakistan ko achche padosi kii tarah rahanaa hi hoga
 The time has come when bilateral negotiations should be resumed
 kuraishi sahab dhithpan kii bhi had hoti he
 Before worrying about improving the relationship, they would have decided that the culprits of the innocent bloodshed in Mumbai could be punished

 hawa main udata hua ek bowing vimaan aakhir kahaan hawa ho gaya
 Even after 12 days no one is able to get the air of that aircraft properly
 satellite ne kuch tasviren dekhi hai or ashanka jaahir kii he ki ho saktaa he ye vahi vimaan ho jisaki talash main samandar se aasmaan tak puri duniya ke log nazren gadaaye baithe hai
 How that plane with 239 passengers disappeared suddenly has become a puzzle
 to aisi 13 paheliyaan hai jisamen se kisi ek paheli main, wo sach chupa hua he
 Which the whole world wants to know
 flite sankhya MH 370 ke laapata hone kaa kya raaj he
 For people around the world, this is a puzzle that does not appear to be solved at the moment
 12 din se malaysian bowing vimaan kii talash main lage 26 mulkon ko kuch aisi paheliyaan jarur mili hai jinamein se kisi ek kaa sach vimaan ke rahasyamay tareeke se laapata hone ke sach ke ekadam kareeb ho saktaa he
 That is, in one puzzle, the truth about the plane is hidden, which the whole world is desperate to know
 ek udata hua vimaan duusare udate hue vimaan kii aad main chup jaae
 Is that possible ji haa bilkul mumkin he
 This can happen in aviation
 lekin yahi wo paheli bhi he jisane un logon ko ulajhaa diya jo flite sankhya MH 370 ke laapata hone kii paheli sulajhane kii talash main din raat ek kar rahe hai
 In technical parlance it is called single blip
 ashanka yahi he ki malaysia kaa bowing vimaan us roj kuch isi tarah se puri duniya kii nazar se bachaakar gupt sthaan par le jaaya gaya
 It happens that the plane flying in the air falls under the guise of another plane flying in the same shape and direction and in that case, the grounded radar or satellite cannot differentiate between the two planes
 nateeja ye hota he ki us tamaam raste main ek vimaan radar kii nazar main nahin aata jab tak donon vimaan alag alag nahin ho jate
 In order to hide the flying aircraft under the cover of other aircraft, it requires great skill and experience
 kya america nau sena ke kabje main he flite number MH 370?khulaasa chaunkaane vaala he
 When the Russian expert put it in front of the era, the whole world was shocked
 kyonki laapata vimaan ko talash karne vaale deshon main america bhi shaamil he
 The Russian expert was apprehensive that as soon as the Boeing plane on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing changed its course, it was captured by the US Navy's radar stationed in the Pacific Ocean
 chetavanee ke baavjood jab vimaan apane tay raste par nahin lautaa to america nau sena ke vimaanon ne use apane kabje main kar liya
 Apart from these, there is also a puzzle on which people seem to believe the most
 kya vimaan kisi alian kii giraft main he?jitne munh utani baaten
 The debate on the social sites about the missing Malaysian aircraft on 8 March is in full swing
 is tark ke saath ki aasmaan main udne vaali udantashtariyon hi malaysian vimaan ke laapata hone kii vajah hai
 This argument is also being received because in the search of 11 days, no debris was found from the Boeing aircraft nor any other evidence of the accident of the aircraft
 kya payalat ne khudakushi kar lee?is shaks par tabhi se duniya bhar kii nazar he jab se vimaan laapata hua
 The apprehension is because 53-year-old Captain Zahari Ahmed Shah was the main pilot of the flight MH 370 on March 8 and Zahari Ahmed was a political party supporter
 anwar ibrahim ko sudomi ke maamle main 7 march ko 5 saal kii jail kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 According to the investigating agencies, Zahari Ahmed was also present in the court that day
 adaalat ke is faisle se zahaari behad dukhi tha
 It is believed that Zahari, being unhappy with the punishment of his leader, ended the contact of the aircraft with radar and then committed suicide
 ajeeb se lagane vaale is aasamaani rahasy ko agar koi sulajhaa saktaa he to vahi 13 paheliyaan jo ab tak saamne ai hai or mana yahi ja rahaa ki unamem se hi kisi ek paheli kii aad main udata hua vimaan achaanak bich hawa se laapata ho gaya
 The matter does not end here right now
 kyonki flite sankhya MH 370 jin halaat main laapata hui usko lekar behisaab kisse kahe ja rahe hai
 Whenever suspicion goes to a terrorist organization, sometimes questions arise about the pilot
 us vimaan kii talash main malaysia se lekar dakshin australia tak kaa kareeb 70 lakh 68 hajaar varg kilometre kaa dayera khangala ja rahaa he
 But instead of solving the puzzle of the missing plane, it continues to get entangled
 flite sankhya MH 370 kii talash ke liye 70 lakh 68 hajaar varg kilometre kaa dayera khangala ja rahaa he
 At the same time, attempts are being made to understand those puzzles
 
 
 jisane duniya bhar ke saamne aae ab tak ke sabase bade hawaii suspence ko dur karne main kamyaabi mil sake
 Boeing aircraft are at an altitude of about 40 thousand feet above the ground while flying technical failure in the ship from higher altitude
 isse zyada oonchai par agar yatri ne oxigen mask na pahana ho, kuch hi second main wo behosh ho saktaa he
 The apprehension is that after staying at the same altitude for some time as soon as the pilot brought the aircraft to normal altitude, a technical fault caused atc's radar to lose contact with the aircraft and the aircraft went missing
 kya vimaan piresi kaa shikaar hua?flite sankhya MH 370 ne raat 12 baj kar 41 minute par kwalalmpur se udaan bhari thi
 And exactly 49 minutes later the aircraft was transponded off
 atisi usee transponder ke jariye vimaan or uske root ko jameen se control karti he
 Anyone who switched off the transponder of the aircraft knew that the aircraft would disappear from the eyes of the radar as soon as the transponder stopped
 aviation radio technology main ise piresi bhi kaha jaataa he
 The aircraft was airlifted? The aircraft lost contact with ATC shortly after taking flight from the International Airport in Kuala Lumpur
 uske baad bhi vimaan main kareeb saat ghante udne laayak eendhan maujuud tha
 There is a possibility that the place where the aircraft was last in contact with the satellite was on the south west side of Kalaalampur
 vahaan samandar main kai aise tapu hai
 Where there is no population and there are secret airstrips dating back to World War II, and the Boeing 777 wheels are easily unloadable even on weak runways
 mumkin he ki vimaan ko radar kii najar se bachaakar aise hi kisi gupt sthaan par le jaaya gaya ho
 Victim of criminal conspiracy? The plane lost contact with ATC within an hour of flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport
 jaanchakarta kai baar kah chuke hai ki vimaan kaa sampark khud nahin tutaa balki use todaa gaya
 So, did the plane become a victim of any criminal conspiracy
 kya vimaan ke musafiron main koi aisa bhi tha jisane vimaan par kabja kar liya or use gupt sthaan par le gaya
 Hijacking of the plane? It is also feared
 lekin itane dinon baad ye baat gale nahin utar rahi ki vimaan kaa apharan hua
 The reason is simple
 jin logon ne vimaan kaa apharan kiya aakhir wo chaahate kya hai
 What are their demands? 
 Why the hijackers have not come before the world yet? The bomb blast in the aircraft is also a fear that the plane has been the victim of a bomb blast
 lekin ye baat isliye gale nahin utar rahi kyonki itane bade ilaake main vimaan ke malbe kaa ek bhi tukdaa nazar nahin aayaa
 It is clean
 agar aisa koi haadasa hota to kisi na kisi kii nazar main to jarur aata
 There was also a suspected passenger in the plane? Investigators looking for the missing aircraft also suspect a Malaysian citizen
 naam he mohammad kherul aamiri salaamat
 The 29-year-old passenger is an aviation engineer and was stationed in an aircraft company in China
 
 The suspicion is that Salamat knows the skill of protecting the aircraft from the eyes of radar
 vimaan ke laapata hone main taliban kaa haath?vimaan kii talash main jute desh is ashanka ko nazarandaaj nahin kar rahe ki vimaan ke laapata hone main kisi talibani sanghathan kaa haath na ho
 Elsewhere, this aircraft may not have been secretly saved by the terrorists from the sight of radar and reached the hideout of Afghanistan
 aatank kii sajeesh?malaysian vimaan ke laapata hone ke baad sabase pehle isi ashanka ne duniya ko daraa diya tha ki kahin 9 / 11 kii tarah koi badi aatanki sajeesh anjaam na di ja rahi ho
 But with the passing of time this theory began to weaken
 satellite kii tasveeron ko padhane waalon ne jo taaja sach duniya ko bataaya he
 He is really creepy
 ishaara ye he ki hind mahaasaagar main
 
 australia se bhi hajaaron kilometre dur gahare samandar kii laharon par
 Some pieces of broken aircraft have been seen at one place
 is khulaase ke saath hi kai sawaal bhi saamne aa gaye
 And the biggest question was whether the aircraft could reach this far
 or agar nahin, to wo malba kiskaa he?kya laapata vimaan kaa pataa mil gaya? kya vaaki flite sankhya MH 370 kisi haadase kaa shikaar hui he? kya samandar main mila wo anjaanaa tukdaa usee bowing kaa he jo 12 roj pehle laapata hua tha?agar ye khabar sach he
 
 
 If those pictures are not lying to the satellite
 
 If all the apprehensions of the teams around the world looking for the aircraft are true
 
 
 or agar hindmahasaagar ke gahare samandar kii laharon par bahata wo tukdaa vaaki usee vimaan kaa he jo 12 roj pehle gaayab hua tha, to isse zyada dardanaak sach haal ke vakt main duniya ke saamne shaayad hi aayaa ho
 Those who read the pictures from the satellite have pointed to this terrible truth
 yani malaysia kaa wo laapata vimaan kisi haadase kaa shikaar hokar samandar main gir gaya or vimaan par savaar tamaam musafir maut ke ghat utar gaye
 For the last 12 days, 18 ships, 19 aircraft and 6 helicopters from 26 countries around the world were engaged in searching for that missing aircraft
 lekin guuruuvaar ko jaise hi ek satellite kii tasviir kaa khulaasa hua to puure malaysia main cheekh pukaar tej ho gai
 Because with this single news, all his hopes were also absorbed into the deep sea
 bataaya yahi ja rahaa he ki satellite ke camere ne hind mahaasaagar main ek aisa tukdaa bahata hua dekha he, jo kisi vimaan kaa tutaa hua hissaa mahasoos ho rahaa he
 The place where the piece appeared is said to be about 1460 miles to the south of Perth city of South Australia, ie 2260 kilometers away
 or satellite kii tasveeron kaa sach agar sahi he to us jagah 24 mile ke daayre main vimaan ke tukade bikhare hue hai
 If the Defense Minister of Malaysia is to be believed then every news that is necessary for him is related to flight number MH 370
 ho saktaa he ki satellite se mili tasviir sach bol rahi ho
 It is possible that the guesses of those who read the photographs are correct
 lekin kuch sawaal to phir bhi hai
 Everyone is feeling the need for an answer
 kam se kam vimaan kaa malba paye jane kii ittela milane ke baad
 For example - the place where the aircraft was rubbed, how did the aircraft reach it
 jabaki atisi ke saath uskaa sampark to tut gaya tha? kya vimaan ko payalat ne hi samandar main duboya he? kya idhan khatm hone ke baad vimaan samandar main gir gaya?kya atisi se sampark tuutane ke baad vimaan main itnaa idhan bachaa tha ki wo itani duuri tay kar sake? yaa phir wo malba kisi or kaa he? in sawaalon ke jawaab ke bina vimaan ke laapata hone kii paheli sulajh nahin sakati?

 The opposition said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should listen to the opposition's talk inside the house and also put his point in the house, but instead of coming to the house, PM keeps his talk outside

 Would you believe that even in today's age, daughters are cheaper than bull and second hand scooters? Would you believe that even today, daughters are being bought and sold in big cities and metros? What are the market for humans in shops? Can't believe it? But after what you will see in the incident, you have to believe it
 ek jodi bail kii keemat 30 hajaar rupeek puraane scooter kii keemat 15 hajaar rupaper ek ‘gudiya’ kii qeemat sirf do hajaar rupaji haa, desh kii betiyaan bik rahi hai
 The country's 'doll' is on sale
 desh kii ladli bik rahi he
 Not only is it selling but it is selling out of nothing
 galiyon main bik rahi he, dukaanon main, gaanvon or shaharon main bik rahi he
 This is the awful truth that will shock you today
 aapaki ankhen fatty kii fatty rah jaaengi jab aap 21veen sadi kii us mandi ko dekhenge jahaan aaj bhi insaanon ko gulaamon or jaanwaron kii tarah kharida or bechaa jaataa he
 You will not believe even if you saw your eyes how daughters are being sold in big cities, metros
 or kharidne vaale kharid rahe hai
 Sometimes, in the name of jobs, sometimes in the name of marriage, sometimes in the name of sending abroad, sometimes in the name of working in the house, the selling and selling of girls continues
 chote-chote kasbon, gaanvon se bhed-bakriyon kii tarah ladakiyon ko shaharon main laayaa ja rahaa he
 Their poverty is being bid and then they are being thrown into the market
 baaki chhodie akele sarkari aankadon kii baat karen, to sirf pichley saal desh main takreeban 4 hazaar ladkiyaan kharidi or bechi gayi
 While non-government figures are about a hundred times more than this
 sabase khatarnaak tasviir to desh kii rajdhani dilli kii he
 Where businessmen are constantly throwing dust in the eyes of human trafficking business under the guise of placement agencies
 human trephiking kii andhi galiyon kaa sach rongte khadey karanevaala he
 Actually, the team till date came to know that the biggest market for buying and selling of daughters is in Delhi today
 alag-alag naamon se alag-alag dukaane khuli hui hai
 And in those shops, the purchase of human beings is marketed
 lihaaja isi ke baad jab aaj tak ne aisi dukaanon main jhaankne kii koshish kii, to khuleam chal rahi is mandi kii hakeekat dekh kar ham sann rah gaye
 The world of human trafficking, ie the human trafficking world, has a big religion in itself
 maanav taskari ke sabase bade thikaane yani dilli main human trephiking kii hakeekat kya he, ye jaanane ke liye aaj tak ne ek-ek kar dilli main human trephiking ke kai addon kaa rukh kiya or is koshish main jo kuch dikhaa, wo vaaki haroonges tha
 Girls were selling in these shops of human beings, from household chores to jismaphorishi
 shakurabastidilli ke uttar-pashchimi kone par basaa ek rihaayshi ilaaka
 In this area alone, there are more than 180 shops of human trafficking under the name of Placement Agency, who have been indulging in human trafficking for years by defying all the laws
 inhen agency kii hakeekat jaanane ke liye shakurabasti kii tang galiyon se hote hue aaj tak ja pahunchaa aisi hi ek placement agency es
 K
 interprijej ke daftar tak
 Where there is such a broker named Manoj, who was doing this business for years
 aaj tak ne usase maid sarvent hair karne se baatcheet kii shuruyaat kii or lagaataar aage badhate gaye
 We asked him
 
 
 sawaal - kamishan kitna lagegaa?jawaab - kul 35 hajaar
 Of 20 thousand agents and 15 thousand are also made of us
 sawaal - logon kii kisi-kisi demand aati he?jawaab - are sar, kuch log to bilkul alag hi demand karte hai
 Question - What do you say, right
 
 
 jawaab - ek baar dilli ke hi ek esechao aae the or kehane lage aisi naukaraani do jo puraa khyaal rakhe, puraa khyaal matlab sabakuch kare
 
 
 Question - So are there such maids? Answer - Absolutely, you spend money, it will take about 30 to 40 thousand a month, but there will be good maintenance, you can take it out with you, you will also speak English
 sawaal - kahaan se aaengi ye ladkiyaan?jawaab - darjeeling se laaenge, shillong main bhi aisi ladkiyaan mil jaaengi
 You do not worry, you will not lose money
 
 Question - When will we get such a girl? Answer - You will arrange 5 to 7 days of time
 munhmaangi keemat ke badale ye dalal hamen aisi ladki laakar dene kii baat bhi karne laga jo maid sarvent hone ke saath-saath jismfaroshi ke liye bhi taiyaar ho
 The man named Manoj has even told that the police officers themselves are involved in such horse-trading
 ham ek placement agency kii hakeekat dekh chuke the
 So, we left and went to another agency
 ek benaam agency
 There was a woman sitting in this agency, who agreed to have a conversation on seeing us
 yahaan bhi pehle hamane maid sarvent ke liye baat kii
 And from what he told, it became clear that how innocent girls are trapped in rural areas of the country and sold to cities
 sawaal - aap hi jaati ho ladki logon ko laane ke liye
 
 
 Answer - Yes, i only go
 jharkhand se laati hum ladkiyaan
 Question- how many girls do you bring at one time
 jawaab - jate hai to 4 se 5 ladkiyaan le aate hai
 Question - You are not scared? Answer - No, i am not afraid, i get everyone to eat and drink on the way
 ye agent naaballik yani mahaj 11 saal kii ladki ko bhi hamen bechney ke liye taiyaar ho gai
 Question - Our friend's house needs a little girl for work
 jawaab -haa thik he, main de duungi
 You tell me where it will be
 ladki main bhej duungi koi dikkat nahin he
 Clearly, these shops operating in the name of placement agency without any screen are enough to prove how the police traffic in Delhi is being aggressively pursued by the police
 garibi ne use majaboor kiya to wo apane ghar se baahar nikali, naukari karne
 But in the name of the job, she did not sell once - eight times
 pehali baar uski keemat lagi sirf do hajaar rupee
 But then it started selling such that the price increased from two thousand rupees to 30 thousand rupees
 dasiyon haathon se bikne or balaatkaar kaa shikaar hone ke baad ab is ‘gudiya’ ko ye samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki akhir wo jaae to kahaan jaae?naam -- sarita tantiumr -- 18 saalapata -- udaalgudi, asamaqimat -- sirf 30 hajaar rupesunne main ye baat beshak ajeeb lage lekin human trephiking yani maanav taskari kii duniya main is vaqt is ladki kii keemat kuch itani hi he
 In a time when humans are measuring distances of the moon and Mars, large hydron colliders are being used, in that era, if a girl in the capital of the country is sold in a few rupees like a lifeless thing or sheep and goat
 If you go then what will you call it? The story of this girl coming from a very backward area of assam is similar
 aaj se aath saal pehle jab is ladki kii pehali baar boli lagi thi, tab isaki keemat sirf 2 hajaar rupee thi
 But since then, its price has increased by 15 times
 yani 2 hazaar rupee se badhkar isaki keemat ab 30 hajaar rupee tak pahunch chuki he
 But look at this age, this girl has not been able to earn as much rupees in all her age till now, in which this time it is being bid
 maanav taskari kii duniya kaa yahi sach he
 Sarita Tanti- 'I was sold many times, cheated
 
 
 ’sarita ko dilli main acha kaam dilaane ke naam par usee ke gaanv kaa ek ladkaa tab dilli lekar aayaa tha, jab uski umr sirf 10 saal thi
 Sarita's family of 2 brothers and 7 sisters was very poor and Sarita came out of the house with the intention of changing the destiny of her family at that young age
 iske baad uske parivaar kii takadir to nahin badali, lekin sarita kii takadir jarur badal gai
 Through Anurag Enterprises, a Punjabi Bagh placement agency, Sarita was sold eight times during these eight years and worked as a maid in different houses
 lekin ek baar bhi use apni tankhwaah nahin mili
 During this time, someone kept Sarita locked up in an avalanche for years, then someone kept her hungry for several days
 ek baar to punjab ke khanna main kaam karne ke dauraan us par chori kaa iljaam lagaakar uske haath tak jala die gaye
 But the real pain of Sarita's life was yet to come
 is jyaadati ke baad sarita jab bhaag kar ek baar phir usee placement agency main pahunchi, to yahaan baleshwar naam ke ek ladke ne uske saath balaatkaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 After this, all the limits of oppression were ended with Sarita and Baleshwar even got her aborted
 aakhir main jab sarita ne is silsile main dilli ke saraswati vihaar thane main shikaayat kii, to police ne baleshwar ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke bajaay donon kaa samjhauta kara diya
 Now Baleshwar got encouraged and he forcefully filled the vermilion demanding Sarita
 sarita taanti- ‘mere saath kai baar rape kiya, aborshan karavaaya gaya
 
 
 'but when Sarita saw Baleshwar doing the same with the other girls, then she escaped from Baleshwar's clutches
 ab haalat ye he ki wo baleshwar or uske doston ko sajaa dilaanaa chaahati he
 But how is this possible, no one knows at the moment
 ye he rajdhani dilli kii hakikatdesh kii rajdhani hone ke naate agar dilli ko puri duniya main ek bada makaam hasil he, to human trephiking kaa sabase bada thikaana hone ke naate is shahar kii badanaami bhi kam nahin he
 But what is it that makes Delhi the largest bastion of human trafficking? ghar main kaam dilaane se lekar shaadi ke jhaanse or phir jismfaroshi tak, jab dilli kii hakeekat janenge to aap chaunk jaaenge
 To say that Delhi is the city from which the country runs
 yahi wo jagah he jahaan saare kanoon banate hai or yahi wo thikaana he, jahaan se ye puure desh main lagu hote hai
 But alas, in the case of human trafficking, all laws probably die here
 kyonki agar aisa nahin hota to aaj dilli desh main human trephiking ke sabase bade adde ke taur par badnaam nahin hoti
 One such hub, which is also sourced, transit route as well as destination
 yani ye wo jagah he, jahaan insaanon kii kharid-farokht kii shuruyaat bhi hoti he, duusare shaharon se unhen aage bechney ke liye yahaan laayaa bhi jaataa he or yaheen jismfaroshi ke addon par yaa phir alag-alag jagahon par unhen bechaa bhi jaataa he
 Due to poverty and hunger, thousands of people from the backward states of the country run towards all the major cities of the country including Delhi
 or maanav taskari ke dhandhe se jude log garibon kii isi majaburi kaa saalon se phayda uthaa rahe hai
 First, such people, especially poor girls, are lured in the pretext of getting them to work in homes or factories and then transported directly to Delhi by trains
 pashchim bengal, bihar, jharkhand, assam or odisha jaise rajyon se pehle maanav taskari kar ladakiyon ko trainon main dilli laayaa jaataa he or phir yahaan se yaa to unhen dilli main hi bech diya jaataa he yaa phir placement agency kii madad se haryana, punjab, gujarat or rajasthan ke alag-alag shaharon main pahunchaa diya jaataa he
 The special thing is that during this time the promises made to girls are not fulfilled on the one hand, on the other hand they are also made victims of sexual exploitation
 lekin ye hakeekat sirf dilli kii nahin he, balki dilli ke alaava desh ke tamaam duusare shaharon main bhi maanav taskari kaa kaarobaar badastoor he
 According to the data of the National Crime Record Bureau, this business is increasing continuously year after year
 in aankadon main mutabik saal 2009 main maanav taskari ke jahaan takreeban 3000 maamle saamne aae the, vahiin ek saal baad yani 2010 main ye 3422 maamle record kiye gaye
 Then the following year, in 2011, the figure reached 3517, and among these victims of human trafficking, there were more girls, who were either transported to gismfrosh bases or sold to Gulf countries
 ab maanav taskari kaa kaarobaar jab itane bade paimaanon par or berok-tok andaaj main ho, to kanoon ke muhafizon par shaq hona lajimi he
 But according to experts, under the guise of Placement Agency, the Delhi Police itself keeps turning its eyes on the business of human money in exchange for a few rupees
 or to or punjabi baag, rajori garden samet pashchimi dilli ke kai thanon kii police ko iske liye bandhi-bandhai rakam milti he

 Many happy birthday wishes to him
 suna he sarkaar kek kaatane or berthde manaane videsh gaye hai
 Well, there is no atmosphere of happiness in the country at this time
 uttarakhand main baari barish ke chalate tabaahi machi hui he
 Thousands of passengers are stranded
 or aapke nivas sthaan dilli main bhi bhayank baadh kaa khatra he
 In such a situation, while cutting the cake here, everyone would talk about Nero and Rome
 vaise bhi ye sab sanbhaalane ke liye manmohan singh hai, sonia gandhi hai
 You are not kyonki abhi taiyaari chal rahi he
 The prince who knows the poison of power is still reikiing the situation
 to kya hua jo isamen 9 saal lag gaye
 With the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, you had made it clear that Indian politics is very complicated and maybe after 30 years i will be able to comment on it
 abhi 21 saal baaki hai
 The country will wait
 isaki gandhi namdhari maseehaa par aasthaa nahin digne vaali
 So citing the same faith, the public has prepared a wishlist
 aaj aapkaa berthde he, aap khush to bahut honge
 On the occasion of this happiness, read it, understand and tell, what is your return gift, in return for these wishes
 1
 When will you take responsibility, the wait is also bored of waiting, the organization is saying that you should come forward
 pradhanmantri samet kai congressi netaa kah chuke hai ki rahul gandhi kaa hi netritv chahie ab
 But you are not able to tell whether the next Lok Sabha election will be fought under your guidance or not
 ranneetikaar aapke daftar se tainaat hote hai
 The old satraps in the organization have also reached the post of retirement
 jimmaa jinako mila he, ve aapke vishwast hai
 But still you remain behind the curtain
 yaad rakhie ki is desh ne 2004 main sonia gandhi ke piem pad na lene ko tyaag mana tha
 But it is also believed that Sonia has become a power center without responsibility
 karpshan hota he, mahangaai badhati he to jimmaa manmohan sarkaar kaa
 If anything is popular, credit goes to Soniaji
 agar aapako lagata he ki yun hi satta bina jimmedaari milti rahegi, to phir se sochie
 Because the pawns of politics have understood this trick of the king
 2
 Why do you stop exploring India after elections? bike par baithe
 Followed on footpaths
 virodhiyon ne hallaa kiya par desh ne dhyaan diya
 You have also said repeatedly that people do not go, then you say that you sit in the capital and do politics
 main ja rahaa hum to aap puch rahe hai, kyon ja rahe ho
 But after you leave, a question is coming to mind again and again
 wo yah he ki aapane 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke pehle upi ke gaanv kasbe chaan maare
 The search for India continued day and night
 kahin kisi khaat par raat guzari, kabhi kisi kune par snaan kiya
 But after the election, this search stopped
 kya des ko 2014 yaa agle vidhansabha chunaav kaa intjaar karnaa chahie is khoj ke sikval ko dekhne ke liye
 Search for you, greed of the public darasal, aap jab jahaan jate, zyaadaatar congress or kuch ek baar duusare rajnatik dalon ke shashan vaali jagahon par, to vahaan kii badahaali surkhiyon kaa hissaa ban jaati
 She would have been blessed by coming into the mainstream
 to yatra jari rakhie taaki aapako samasyaayein pataa chalati rahen or samasyaon ko aapkaa pataa miltaa rahe

 jab jarurat hoti he, tab aap najar hi nahin ateapke pita rajeev gandhi se desh ko bahut ummiden thim
 Even his grandfather, Nehru, did not get such a big mandate
 rajeev ko iskaa ilm tha
 He had also said at the party's Mumbai session, 'I too am young
 mere bhi kuch sapane hai
 'some of those dreams came true, most of them remaining incomplete
 panchayat raaj kaa sapana to manaregaa kii lut ke chalate pakki neend so gaya
 Well, you are also young
 jab tab apane sapane saajha karte hai
 But the reality is that when the country needs this young leader's voice, his thinking and leadership the most, then you are missing
 disambar main dilli samet desh sadakon par utraa
 Everyone was angry after the gang rape incident
 is dauraan scindia najar aae
 RPN Singh appeared
 or bhi party or satta ke sipahasaalar dikhe
 But you, little supremo, could not be seen anywhere
 abhi desh kaa uttari hissaa baadh se jujh rahaa he
 Delhi is also in danger
 magar aap phir nahin hai
 There are often no necessary debates in Parliament
 to kya aap sirf apane deshaatan ke dauraan hi bayanon kaa darshan baghaarenge

 youth sanghathan main kitna aayaa loktantr2004 main saansad bane
 In 2007 the party's national general secretary
 isse pehle itani tej growth ek hi netaa kii hui thi
 Your father Rajiv Gandhi
 chachaa sanjay kii safadarajang hawaii adde par accident main maut ke baad anmane man se papa ko raajnneeti main aana padaa
 He also became an MP from Amethi and then soon general secretary
 unhone nahin kaha, par aapane baar-baar kaha, 'main ek khaas naam or system kii vajah se yahaan tak aa gaya hum
 i still want to change this system
 party main loktantr laana chahta hum
 So whose son you are, things are not decided by this
 ' desh ko is bayaan se ummid bandhi
 You went to many universities
 saath main minakshi natarajan thim
 Well-equipped intellectuals who climbed the ladder of the organization one by one and are mps of Mandsaur
 aapane samvaad kiya
 Repeat the same facts and arguments
 phir tughlaq road ke daftar par intervyuu kiye
 Of those who run the organization
 yuvaaon ko tarjeeh kii baat hui
 Elections to the Youth Congress and NSUI were held under the voter list and under the supervision of former Election Commissioner Lyngdoh
 magar ye kya
 Here your philosophy was cheated
 zyaadaatar rajyon main rasukhdaar netaaon ke putr yaa rishtedaar yaa unke camp se cmand lene vaale netaa kabiz ho gaye
 And further speaking, in UPA two governments, how many people from these organizations were given full share of power
 jab yuva mantriyon kii list dekhte hai, to yahaan bhi sarnem kaa vajan najar aata he
 But you were fighting against this
 5
 If we win, we lose Rahul's hard work and local reasons is a saying
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke munh se suni thi kanpur kii ek sabha main
 Chit also mine, pat too my, my father's
 party sanghathan aapke liye jane anjaane yahi karata he
 Lok Sabha elections were held in 2009
 upi main party ne anumaanon ko dhwast karte hue 21 siten jeetin
 Everyone said, yes, your commander Digvijay Singh also said that Rahul is magic
 hamane mana, saraahaa
 But then came the assembly elections in 2012 after three years
 sab kuch vaise hi tha
 Interviews, ticket distribution and your tour
 magar siten 2007 ke kharaab pradarshan main sui baraabar sudhaar kar pain
 The party got just 28 seats in the assembly
 tab phir yahi commander saamne aae or kaha ki sthaneey muddon par chunaav lade gaye or isko rahul ji kaa report card nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The same happened in Bihar
 abhi karnataka ke chunaav hue
 If your party wins, then the same argument that Rahul ji's leadership is a victory
 to janata jaananaa chaahati he ki sirf jeet kaa sehara hi kyon, haar kii kuch mitti bhi to maathe par lage
 6
 modi hai mukaable main, kya hai khyaal aapke2007 main gujarat vidhansabha ke chunaav ho rahe the
 Sonia Gandhi went there and called Modi a death dealer
 chatur raajnneetijna modi ne ise bhi apane paksh main bhunaaya or nattejey aae, to vah maton ke saudagar najar aae
 This happened again after five years, this time you too had fought against him in many places
 magar ab masalaa badal gaya he
 The stage has shifted to Delhi
 bijepi ne modi ko paroksh rup se piem candidet ghoshit kar diya
 How aggressive she is, gave proof of breaking the alliance with JDU
 modi dilli aa rahe hai, desh bhar main ja rahe hai or apana agenda saamne rakh rahe hai
 But you are not able to tell how you will face Modi's challenge
 modi par hamalaa karne ko le dekar vahi ek astr hai aapaki party ke paas, ki sampradayik hai
 But compared to the idea that goes with them, which has elements of Hindutva, development and propaganda, why have you not brought any chemical claiming alchemy? or aapke khaas jairam ramesh jab modi ko chunauti maan lete hai, to party main sab unki laanat malaanat main jute jate hai
 Such a refusal only weakens the front
 7
 In the era of activism, the active bus happened once, once, only once
 isliye chamatkaar hi kahie
 The crown prince landed on the streets with the farmers and was arrested
 jagah thi upi kaa bhatta parsul gaanv, jahaan kisaan hai ve ke liye adhigrahit jameen ke kam daam ke virodh main pradarshan kar rahe the
 But apart from this, you could not stand anywhere in front of your or your opponents government
 desh jab agast ke maheene main lokapal ke mudde par andolit hua, to aapane sansad main hui bahes ke dauraan kaha ki kyon na lokapal ko sanvaidhanik darja de diya jaae
 Observers termed it as a statement of the issue
 uske baad aap vidarbha or desh ke duusare pichde ilaakon ke daure par gaye
 Where the rights of farmers, dalits and tribals are being killed
 aapane unke haq main naare buland kiye
 But when he returned to Delhi under the charge of power, everyone forgot
 aapaki party kii nitiyon or iske netaaon ne, unki cargujariyon ne is naare ko ek siyaasi drame main badal diya, jise hakeekat nahin mana ja saktaa

 satta kaa jehar piya he, vachanon kaa amrit hi pilaa do2013 main ek baar phir congress kaa manch sajaa
 The place was Jaipur
 rahul ji ko pradhanmantri banaaya jaae kaa kores gaan ab tak mukhya singer manmohan ke sur dabaa chukaa tha
 That too until he made a sound in the chorus
 magar phir aap bole, nahin abhi main taiyaar nahin
 There was a promotion from the secretary-general to consolidate the preparations and you became the National Vice President
 or phir hamane suna vah bhavuk bhaashan
 Last night, mother came to my room and cried
 kaha satta jehar hoti he
 The country also wept
 jor jor se
 He felt that Rahul Baba finally came to know that the poison is being thrown by the ruling party continuously
 magar uske baad or uske pehle bhi, bhavukta bhare daavon ke alaava aapane hamen kuch nahin diya
 No far-reaching views on a problem
 hamen yaad he to bas aapke piaar form se nirdeshit hote lagate tevar
 When to find the camera and how many arms of the kurta to be offered during that time
 kab chote bachche ko khilaanaa he
 When to give Dimple a smile
 kab use dadhi main chhipaana he
 The country saw the princes descended into the soil
 magar use sunanaa bhi tha ki jo matiamet ho rakhaa he, uskaa samaadhaan kya he

 karpshan kii kaalikh ne kar diya din ko raat, yahaan bhi chup hai aapupie sarkaar kii sabase badi aalochana hoti he karpshan ko lekar
 Many ministers had to resign and the coal scam has reached the PMO
 in sabake pher main satta or sanghathan ke bich rassakashi kii khabaren bhi aati rahati hai
 Sometimes the figures of 2G scam, sometimes someone else, the country has become so used to millions of crores marks, as it has been doing this for years
 darasal barason se kar hi rahaa ginati, satta badalati he or ghotaalon ke ank bhi badal bad jate hai
 But in the midst of all this, the country was angry
 andolan kii bhashaa bolne laga
 Wherever who used the power for corruption, he was evicted
 karnataka main aapane ise dekha or iske mithe nattejey se mili
 But the corruption issue does not remain as soon as it comes out
 is par sattadhish aapse daant nahin khate, sajaa nahin pate
 And there is a truth that your brother-in-law Robert Vadra himself may also be accused
 sach kya he, adaalatein tay karengi, magar aap in sab muddon par chup rahe
 Neither the mind of the country, nor the mind 10 spoke
 aap yuva hai or amuman yuvavastha main hi shaadi kar lete hai logahamen is bahes main nahin padana ki yuva hone kaa baar aap har baras ooncha kyon karte ja rahe hai
 Like investigative journalists, we will not question your Spanish girlfriend living in Venezuela, citing the 2004 interview session in Munshiganj
 masalaa aapaki privesi se judaa he or har hindustani isaki izzat karata he
 But the same people also keep asking that when will the country's handsome, most powerful and that is why the eligible Bachelor get married
 aapako to pataa hi he ki hamaare yahaan parivaar naam kii sanstha kaa kitna mahatv he
 And even today, all consider marriage to be necessary to build a family
 magar aap har baar is baat ko taal dete hai
 Sonia ji also expressed her concern in the signs
 magar aap hai ki des ko desh banane main khape hue hai
 Hey, service is important, but if you have a partner, you get support
 acha rahul ji, aapke berthde par bevajaah itnaa lanbaa khat padhwa diya
 It should be understood that you are busy with the concerns of the country and not much time for this lettering
 magar kya karen, janata he, jaanati he, phir bhi maanati nahin

 Nor is it in the list of other helpful books of CBSE
 lekin jis lekhak ne pathyapustak main aisi tippanee kii he uski bhartsana karata hum
 The Ministry has taken it seriously and will be questioned by the author and publisher
 duusari ore prakaashak new saraswati house ne saaf kiya ki ye vivaadit hissaa kisi jamaane main wike sharma kii kitaab kaa hissaa tha
 But after that attention was removed, that part was removed in the published version two years ago
 prakaashak ne bhi saaf kiya ki 12 veen ke str ke chaatro ke liye ye kitaab jarur likhi gai he
 But not a compulsory part of the curriculum
 prakaashak ne is baat par hairaani jataai ki media main aakhir ab itani puraani kitaab par charchaa kyon ho rahi he
 Actually, the teacher of Haryana and the author of this book, VK Sharma, explained about her perfect figure 36-24-36 in the book of biology about women

 Now what else can i say if i ignore this honor

 Was it not possible for him to find time for the honor being given by the country

 jo khilaadi pahunchane main asamarth honge, unhen pehle se anumati leni hogi or jo bina ijaajat liye nadaarad rahegaa uskaa sammaan bhi radd mana jayega
 The gesture is clear, the Sports Ministry has directly instructed the players
 agar desh khilaadiyon kii kamyaabi ko sar ankhon par letaa he, unhe sammaan detaa he to unka ferj bhi yahi he ki wo ise vinamrata se sweekaar karen
 After all, every player in the world is identified with the name of the country

 a mysterious boat was seen along the maritime borders of India and Pakistan
 is par chaar log savaar the
 They are said to have set the boat on fire for fear of being caught
 ishaaron main bataaya gaya ki 31 disambar ko gujarat kii ore bad rahi is naav ko bich raste main rokkar 26 / 11 ke mumbai hamale jaisi badi ghatana se desh ko bachaa liya gaya he
 This was further strengthened when on 5 January, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar insisted that the boat was carrying terrorists
 unka kahana tha ki suraksha balon ne ‘sahi vakt’ par sahi kaam kiya
 Coast Guard officials say that this incident justifies their new vigil on coastal security after 26 / 11
 nausena or tatarakshak bal kii nigaraanee tiimon ne pichley saal bhartiya samudr taton par suraksha ke prati sambhavit khataron ko soonghtey hue 45,000 se zyada naavon or jalpoton ko rokkar unki talaashi lee
 a Coast Guard officer told India Today, "we have shown our ability to have a successful operation while pursuing intelligence
" hamaare exclusive iconomic jone ke simanton par ham bahut furti se sandigdh nishaanon kaa peechha kar sakate hai or unhen pakad sakate hai
 "actually the root of this operation lies in the failed attempt to stop lashkar-e-taiba (from various agencies) from carrying out the Mumbai attack on the evening of 26 November 2008
 us vakt kam-se-kam 26 chetavaniyaan jari kii gai thim ki aatankwaadi bharat kii vittiya rajdhani main hotalon sahit kai sthanon ko nishaanaa bana sakate hai
 Of these, a warning was very important, which was issued only after 10 attackers were far away from Mumbai
 is par dhyaan diya jaataa to jaghanya hamale ko roka ja saktaa tha
 On November 19, 2008, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) sent a full-page warning to the Indian Navy and Coast Guard
 is par ‘top sikret, most emidiat’ (behad gopneey, turant dhyanarth) kii muhar lagi thi or ibi ke ek sanyukt nideshak ke dastakhat the
 a message from the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) indicated a suspected Lashkar boat where it would be: 24 ° 16 "36" to the north and 67 ° 0 "04" to the east
 
 ro kii is chetavanee main kaha gaya tha ki shnaav ghuspaith kii koshish kar rahi thi”
 It recommended 'necessary action to prevent infiltration'
 yah lashkar kii machhlee pakadaaey vaali naav al-husaini thi, jo chaar din baad 23 november ko hathiyaaron se las 10 aatanki savaaron ke saath apane mishan par nikal padi
 a December 21, 2014, investigation by the New York Times, propublica, and Frontline PBS quoted leaked classified documents from NSA employee Edward Snowden as telling the British and American espionage agencies about Lashkar's preparedness for the Mumbai attack There were a lot of information nearby, but they failed to understand their exact meaning
 unhone bharat kii aatank-nirodhi jaanch agenciyon ko bheji gai 18 november, 2008 kii siie kii ek report kaa zikr kiya he, jisamen mumbai par lashkar hamale ke khatre se judi ek pakistani naav ke ek nishchit sthaan par hone ke bare main bataaya gaya tha
 The ib's November 19 warning was probably based on the same CIA report
 tatarakshak balon ne lashkar kii is sandigdh naav ko khojane ke liye 19 or 23 november ke bich gujarat ke samudr tat par dornear vimaanon se khoji udaanen bhari thim or chaar gashti naukaaen tathaa ek howercraft bhi samudr main utaara tha
 They intercepted 276 boats on the western coastline and searched them, but apparently failed to catch MV Kuber, an Indian boat on which the terrorists rode in Mumbai to wreak havoc
 kai guzaarishon ke baad bhi ibi ne tatarakshak bal ko lashkar kii is naav ke bare main aage kii suchanaaen nahin deen
 While the Coast Guard acted swiftly, the Navy acted indifferently
 2 disambar, 2008 ko admiral surish mehta ne ek press conference main kaha tha ki nausena ko mili khufia chetavaniyaan ‘karrwai karne laayak nahin’ thim
 Naval intelligence officers say that the place mentioned in the IB warning was just 30 nautical miles from Karachi port and within Pakistan's maritime border
 ahm baat yah he ki nausena ne is chetavanee par ‘enene’ (no ection rikhwyred) yaa ‘karrwai kii jarurat nahin’ kii muhar lagaai or use aage kii karrwai ke liye mumbai sthit pashchimi nausainik kaman ko nahin bheja
 This was a terrible mistake because at that time more than 30 warships of the Western Fleet were at sea for practice under 'defense of Gujarat'
 chah saal baad ek duusari hi kahani saamne ai
 7 on 31 December
 30 baje neshnal technical research orgenigeshan (antiaro) kaa ek alert milane ke do ghante ke bheetar hi tatarakshak bal kaa ek dornear gashti vimaan porbandar hawaii adde se ravaanaa ho gaya
 The alert referred to an 'object' inside the sea, which was in contact with the Pakistani Army and the Maritime Security Agency
 chaar or dornear vimaanon ne bhi porbandar hawaii adde se dopaher 12 baje, shaam 4 baje, shaam 7 baje or raat 10 baje ek ke baad ek udaanen bharin, taaki ek vimaan hameshaa naav kaa peechha karata rahe
 Night 10
 30 baje tatarakshak bal kii gashti nauka sijies rajratan ne sandigdh naav ko gher liya
 The boat began to run aground when a 20-foot-tall Rajaratan was chased from a safe distance of 600 meters and asked to stop
 yah peechha madhyaraatri ke baad 3 baje khatm hua, jab vah naav aag kii tej lapaton se ghiri dikhaai di
 Coast Guard officials say that the people on the boat set themselves on fire
 mana jaataa he ki naav par savaar kam-se-kam do log pani main kud gaye or duubakar mar gaye
 The remaining two died from the fire
 4 disambar ko alssubah 4 baje porbandar se pashchim main takreeban 365 kimi dur naav ke doobane ke saath hi aag kii lapaton kaa dikhaai dena band ho gaya
 The identity of the boat is yet to be proved
 2 janvari ko raksha mantralay ke ek bayaan main shuruaati taur par ise machhlee pakadaaey vaali naav kaha gaya, jo karachi ke najadik keti bunder se ‘arab mahaasaagar main kisi gaiyrkanoonee kaam ke iraade se’ nikali thi
 This indicated the possibility of smuggler operation
 antiaro ne jo sandesh bich main pakade, unamem bataaya gaya tha ki naav-savaar taton par baithe apane samparkon ke saath ‘saamaan pahunchane’ or ‘kam bank khaaton main jamaa karne’ ke bare main baat kar rahe the
 But the details of the goods were not mentioned in them
 mana jaataa he ki is rahasyamayi naav ke saath chal rahi ek or naav tatarakshak bal ke dornear vimaanon ke morche par pahunchane se pehle hi waapas mudakar pakistan kii ore chali gai
 The most intriguing puzzle in this bureau is fire
 naav savaaron ne aatmasamarpan karne kii bajaae mar janaa kyon pasand kiya? parrikar ise unhen aatankwaadi maanane kaa saboot maanate hai
 He said, "even a normal boat carrying narcotics will surrender by throwing the narcotics into the sea
 koi bhi khud ko tab tak nahin maaregaa, jab tak vah aisa karne ke liye amada na ho
 Coast Guard officials refer to an October 1999 incident
 yah ghatana ek japani malwahak jahaaj emvi alondra renbo ke saath ghati thi, jise indonesian samudri lutere hathiyaakar arab sagar main le aae the
 When Coast Guard ships surrounded the ship, the robbers set it on fire to destroy it
 tatarakshak bal ke purv mahanideshak prabhakaran palari kehete hai, “bilkul mumkin he ki is naav main savaar log naav par laden un sabooton ko nasht karnaa chaahate hon jinke kaaran ve funs sakate hai
 During this time, the fire became uncontrollable
 ” naav kaa malba samudri sataha se kareeb 2,000 meter neeche padaa hua he, jisaki vajah se kisi nirnaayak saboot kaa milanaa bhi mushkil ho gaya he
 However, this issue has given ammunition to political parties for mutual warfare
 congress ke pravaktaa ajay kumaar ne sarkaar kii aatanki hamale kii theory par sawaal uthaae to jawaab main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne unke upar ‘pakistan kii ore se ladgaye’ kaa iljaam laga diya
 According to a Coast Guard official, the Congress here failed to take care of one thing that whatever the task of protecting the shores after 26 / 11, whether it is coordination between agencies or doubling the number of Coast Guard forces Yes, all of that is a legacy of the upa's reign

 Illegal Excavation of Sand in Madhya Pradesh The matter has been surrounded by the statement of its own minister
 In Madhya Pradesh, illegal sand mining has always been a big issue
 pehle congress ne shivaraj singh chouhan ke parivaar or unke karibiyon par avaidh utkhanan kaa aarope lagaate hue jamkar gheraa
 At the same time, the Congress has come under the scanner in the case of illegal mining
 aakhir kaise shivaraj par avaidh utkhanan ke aaropon kii jhadi lagane vaali congress khud avaidh utkhanan ke maamle main fas gai, padhie is report main
 In fact, during the last 15 years in Madhya Pradesh during the BJP rule, the main opposition party Congress made illegal mining a big issue
 yahaan tak ki congress ne tatkaaleen mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke rishtedaaron or karibiyon tak ko avaidh utkhanan main shaamil bataate hue jamkar aarope lagaae the
 Senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Digvijay Singh even accused Shivraj Singh Chauhan of sabotaging the Narmada River during the Narmada Parikrama
 vahiin congress jab madhya pradesh kii satta par 15 saalon ke baad kabiz hui to avaidh utkhanan ko lekar khud kathghare main khadi ho gai he
 Surprisingly, there is no one else who surrounds the Congress government in the case of illegal mining but the Cabinet Minister of Govt
 kamalnath sarkaar main saamaanya prashasan mantri govind singh ne apni hi sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa karte hue kaha ki bhaajapa ke shashan main avaidh utkhanan kaa mudda sadak se lekar vidhansabha tak uthaaya lekin ab hamaari sarkaar he or main janata se kiya vaada puraa nahin kar paa rahaa hum
 At the same time, Govind Singh said, 'I am asked questions if the promises made to the public by staying in opposition in 15 years are not fulfilled now
 is maamle main main jald hi siem kamalnath se mulaakaat karuunga
 'let us tell you that Dr
 Govind Singh is an MLA from the Lahar Legislative Assembly of Bhind district and is the Minister of General Administration Department in the Kamal Nath Government
 unke jile se chambal nadi nikalati he, jisamen bade paimaane par avaidh utkhanan hota he
 Against this, Dr
 Govind Singh fought a lot in the opposition and now when the government came, his pain was relieved to see no action on illegal mining
 haalanki apane mantri ke aaropon par congress dharm sankat main funs gai he
 Can not even refute the minister's point and if supported, will directly hit the target
 vahiin apane saathi mantri kii baat par soobe ke hi ek or mantri pisi sharma ne bayaan diya he ki media ko govind singh kaa bhav samajhnaa chahie
 Their anger is not with the government but on illegal mining, and if they really have any displeasure, it will be resolved
 shivaraj sarkaar par sabase zyada avaidh utkhanan kaa aarope lagane vaali congress jab apane hi mantri ke bayaan se ghir gai to jaahir si baat he bijepi ko mauka milanaa hi tha
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan himself came to the front foot on behalf of BJP, who had always been the target of Congress in the case of illegal mining
 'aaj tak' se baat karte hue shivaraj ne kaha, 'puri nadiya khod daali gai he, pahaad khod daale gaye hai
 Tied from top to bottom
 yah mantri kah rahe hai
 This is wonderful government
 is lut ko roke mukhyamantri
 This is called the Andher Nagari Chaupat Raja
 avaidh utkhanan ke khilaaf andolan hoga
 In fact, illegal mining has been going on in many small and big rivers including Narmada Tawa Chambal in Madhya Pradesh
 isse jahaan nadiyon ke paristhitik tantra par vipareet prabhaav padaa he to vahiin pradesh ke sarkari khajaane ko bhi kai hajaar karod rupee kii chapat lag chuki he or aise main congress ne chunaav ke vakt avaidh utkhanan ko mudda banaate hue is par lagaam lagane kaa vaada to kiya tha lekin 9 maheene biit jane ke baad bhi congress apane vaade par amal nahin kar pai he
 The released ‘cocktail’, featuring Saif Ali Khan Awara and Dilfenk in the role of the young man Gautam, wins the pinch girls, but stays away from commitments

 Meera, ie Diana Penty, is a straightforward girl who has come to London after being a victim of deception
 
 
 ab kahani shuru hoti he
 
 
 The three characters meet each other one by one in London
 
 
 ek saath main khushiyon ke pal baantate hai
 
 
 But when the feelings of true love for each other come in the hearts of these three, everyone's life is filled with sorrow
 
 
 dhimi shuruyaat vaali diarector homi adzania kii 'cocktail' kaa first half behad mazedaar he
 
 
 Deepika, Saif, Saif's maternal uncle Boman Irani, and the role of mother Dimple Kapadia have many strong scenes, and the one-liners of these characters will make you laugh and laugh
 
 
 pyaar kii psychology samajhane main imtiyaaz ali kaa koi sani nahin, jinhone sajid ali ke saath yah film likhi he
 
 
 Imtiaz has also introduced the smallest feeling of love very closely
 
 
 deepika padukon ne ascharyajanak dhang se fashneble zindagi se labalab or safdil ladki kaa behtareen kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 
 
 The new actress Diana Penty was also impressive
 
 
 saf ali khan to apane kariyar kii shuruyaat se hi flert ke role main jamate aae hai
 
 
 Above all, Pritam's music is also amazing
 
 
 tippaniyan But it hurts when the film, which was so impressive till the interval, starts sinking shortly after in the second half
 
 
 lav trengal (prem trikon) apane saath udaasi lekar aata he, lekin kaash, udaasi ke saath boriyat muft na milti
 
 
 It seems as if in the second half the writer-director had no story left to tell, that's why he smothered the characters of Saif, Deepika and Diana with long dialogues
 
 
 is 'cocktail' ke surur kaa ehsaas aapako bahut dhire-dhire hota he, so, agar aapmen itnaa sabar he to 'cocktail' aapke liye he
 
 
 Our rating for the film is - 2

 Now the story begins
 
 
 landan main ek-ek kar teenon kirdaar ek-duusare se milte hai
 
 
 They share moments of happiness together
 
 
 lekin jab in teenon ke dilon main ek-duusare ke liye sachche pyaar kii bhavanaaen aa jaati hai, sabaki zindagi dukh se bhar jaati he
 
 
 The first half of Slow Start director Homi Adajania's 'cocktail' is very funny
 
 
 deepika, saf, saf ke mamaa bane boman irani, or maa ke role main dimpal kapaadiya par kai zordaar seens hai, or in kirdaaron ke van-liners to aapako hansaa-hansaakar lotpot kar denge
 
 
 Imtiaz Ali has no qualms in understanding the psychology of love, who wrote the film with Sajid Ali
 
 
 imtiyaaz ne pyaar kii choti se choti feeling ko bhi behad baariki se pesh kiya he
 
 
 Deepika Padukone has portrayed a wonderfully fashionable and fair-skinned girl
 
 
 nai actress dyna painti bhi impressive rahi
 
 
 Saif Ali Khan has been accumulating in the role of flirt since the beginning of his career
 
 
 upar se preetam kaa music bhi kamaal kaa he
 
 
 The comments lekin dukh hota he, jab interval tak itani impressive rahi film second half main kuch hi samay baad doobane lagati he
 
 
 Love Triangle (love triangle) brings sadness with itself, but wish, boredom with sadness is not free
 
 
 lagane lagata he, jaise second half main riter-diarector ke paas kehane ko kahani hi nahin bachi thi, isiilie saf, deepika or dyna ke kirdaaron ko unhone lambe-lambe dialogs se lad diya
 
 
 You realize the taste of this 'cocktail' very slowly, so if you have so much patience then 'cocktail' is for you

 BJP state unit chief and Deputy Prime Minister Raghuvar Das said in a press conference, 'everyone knows about constitutional obligation
 guruuji (sorain) swayan yah baat kai baar kah chuke hai ki vah upachunaav ladenge
 Asked why no MLA vacated the seat for Soren, while only 75 days are left for him to enter the house as a member, Das said, "wait till the curtain rises
" ’ gathbandhan dwaara kisi uttaradhikari ke bare main vichaar kiye jane kii sambhaavna sambandhi sawaal par unhone kaha ki media ko is tarah ke bhram main nahin rahanaa chahie

 daliton kii naaraazgi dur karne ke liye narendra modi sarkaar SC / ST act ko mul swaroop main behaal karne ke liye sanshodhan vidheyak laai or use paas karaayaa
 Not only this, the government stands in favor of giving reservation to SC / ST employees in the Supreme Court
 modi sarkaar kii daliton par khaasi meharbaani se bijepi kaa mul votbank (savarna) baichaiyn najar aa rahaa he
 Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections next year, the Modi government has taken two important decisions related to the Dalit community
 sarkaar ke is kadam kaa makasad chunavi raajnneeti main daliton ko saadhane ke maddenjar mana ja rahaa he
 There is a lot of resentment among the upper caste community by the steps taken by the government on both issues related to Dalits
 baliya ke bairiya se bijepi vidhayak surendra singhessi-estact ke khilaaf utar aae hai
 Not only this, party workers are also angry somewhere
 party ke savarna netaa khulkar nahin bol rahe hai, lekin dabi jubaan se apana dard bayaan kar rahe hai
 Discussion about this is also in full swing in the branches of RSS
 bijepi vidhayak surendra singh ne kaha ki essiasti act ko lekar supreme court kaa nirnay sahi tha jiske tahat shikayatakarta ke aaropon kii jaanch ke baad giraftaar kaa praavdhaan tha
 Surendra Singh, opposing the decision of Parliament, said that the upper castes should come to the streets for their rights and respect
 surendra singh ne essi-asti act main hue badlaav ke liye sabhi partiyon ko jimmedaar bataate hue kaha ki kya partiyon ko 78 pratishat logon ke vot kii jarurat nahin he jo 22 pratishat dalit vot ke liye bahusankhyak logon ke saath anyaay kar rahe hai
 He said that there has been a race for the plunder of Dalit votes in India, but no matter what the whole society burns
 ek bijepi saansad ne naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki savarna samudaay hi nahin obisi main bhi ise lekar gussa he

 BJP worker Rajendra Singh, who hails from Pratapgarh, says that he has been working as an activist for the party for 30 years
 essi / asti act maamle main sarkaar ne jo kadam uthaaya he, usase dhakka laga he
 The Supreme Court had given a better verdict in this regard
 lekin modi sarkaar ne court ke aadesh ko tilanjali dekar dobaaraa se lagu kiya he
 This has caused a lot of resentment against the BJP in the upper caste community
 rajendra kehete hai kidalit samudaay bijepico vot kare ye jaruri nahin he
 Even after this, the government has resented its guarantee vote by making changes in the SC / ST Act
 2019 main ham to vot daalane kii nahin jaaenge
 Because there is no longer any difference between SP, BSP and BJP
 bijepi saansad ne naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki savarna samudaay hi nahin obisi main bhi ise lekar gussa he
 We are in dire straits
 savarna samudaay ke bich jawaab dete nahin ban rahaa he
 The same questions are being asked everywhere in the area
 bijepi hi nahin aresas kii lagane vaali shakhaon main bhi sarkaar ke is kadam par charchaa ho rahi he
 a district campaigner from Purvanchal, on the condition of anonymity, said that the SC / ST Act is being questioned about the action taken by the government

 The way cases of Dalit oppression are continuously coming to the fore
 aise main dalit utpeedan maamle main essi / asti act ko kargar tareeke se lagaaya gaya to sidhaa asar savarna or obisi samudaay par padegaa
 Its direct impact will be seen in politics

 But words are in the heart
 
 
 to khan sahab gaate hai
 
 
 There has been a wave in my heart right now, some fresh air has gone
 tum to yaaron, abhi se uth baithe,shahar main raat jaagti he abhiiske baad baari ai ab tak khamosh baithe pankaj udhaas sahab kii
 He started with Ghazal
 
 
 sabko maaloom he, main sharaabi nahinphir bhi koi pilaae to main kya karunsirf ek baar najaron se, nazren milenour kasam tut jaae to main kya karunis ghazal ke baad guftgu kaa rukh muda aajkal kii audiyans ke mizaaj par
 Talat Aziz said that romance cannot get old, its style changes with time
 unhone kaha ki aaj kii peedi ke expressant badale hai
 But love is either there or not
 ye kii nahin jaati
 Taking the conversation further, Pankaj Udhas said that i had a Nazm, whose video was also made
 uski nai peedi bahut badi fain hui
 Then i felt that the tongue of love has not changed
 jaise talat ne kaha ki ho saktaa he ki andaaj badla ho
 But i believe that for the expression of love, there can be no better word than Urdu and Ghazal
 talat ajij ne sunaaya ek kissa
 Mohatrama came and said, Ghazal and his Urdu are very difficult
 is par maine unhen sunaay
 
 
 If i search i will find someone
 magar tumhaari tarah koun mujhako chahega
 Hearing this she said, wow, is this ghazal
 maine kaha, jaisaa aap samajhnaa chahen
 When there was talk on love, Ghulam Ali used to interfere
 unhone sunaaya bachapan ke dinon kaa kissa, jab lahore radio ke saath ishk kii shuruyaat ho chuki thi
 Nasir Kazmi's Ghazal
 chupake-chupake raat din aansu bahaanaa yaad he
 The tune was composed by Ghulam Ali
 zikr hua to sur kaa aana lajimi tha
 So Ghulam Ali sang Ghazal
 
 
 chupake-chupake raat dinansu bahaanaa yaad hehamako ab tak aashiqui kaavo jamaana yaad he
 
 
 Then there was mention of Bollywood in the Mahafil and Ghazals were sung in Talat Aziz's film Bazaar and Umrao Jaan
 mukhade kii shuruyaat hui raag bageshwari main
 Then there was talk of flowers in the night
 
 
 talat ne bataaya ki us vakt single tech recording kii koshish hoti thi
 Lata ji was in the song in the year of eighties
 talat bahut nervas the, unhone lata ji ko bataaya
 Lata ji asked why, he told that i am singing with you, lest there be any mistake
 to lata boleen ki aap to acha gaate hai
 So it came out of Talat's mouth, when did you hear
 to lata di ne bataa diya ki doordarshan ke kis program ke liye suna
 Then later Talat understood that Lata Di was tying her up to make her comfortable
 baharhaal, baat gajalon kii
 
 
 This ghazal of Umrao Jaan, which Talat himself did not think that it would be so powerful
 jindagi jab bhi tere bajm main laati he hamenye jameen chand se behatar najar aati he hamenhar mulaakaat kaa anjaam judaai kyon hob to har vakt yahi baat sataati he hamenakhri main talat ajij bole ki ghazal vaale kisi ko thappad nahin maarthe, gaali nahin dete, isliye khabaron main amuman nahin aate
 Otherwise there is a lot of ghazal in the world

 After that, the chain of slave started
 gulam ali bole ki pakistan main log mujhase pyaar karte hai or khush hote hai ki ye hindustan main jaakar apana or mulk kaa naam ooncha karata he
 Talat Aziz said that it would be better if Pakistan makes Ghulam Ali as its brand ambassador
 sara masalaa sudhar jayega
 Ghulam Ali said that yes, the tone should be met
 talat ajij ne sunaaya atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa ek kissa
 He went to Kerala for a holiday while he was PM

 He asked Atal, any request from you

 In 2011, India won the Cricket World Cup for the second time
 kuch din pehle hi puure desh ne mahendra singh dhoni ke padmabhushan aword ke saath is jeet kii 7veen varshganth banaai
 However, once again this World Cup is in discussion

 a member of the 2011 World Cup winning team is being investigated for match fixing

 The match-fixing syndicate also organized a domestic T20 tournament in Jaipur in July last year
 indian express ke anusaar sabase pehle yah raajapootaana premier lig (arpel) BCCI ke anti karpshan security unit ke radar par aayaa tha
 The CID team of Abraajasthan police is investigating it
 raajapootaana premier lig (arpel) main club cricketron ne bhaag liya tha or iskaa sidhaa prasaaran Neo Sports par hua tha
 Let me tell you that Neo Sports previously had the broadcast rights for the domestic matches of the Indian cricket team
 sutron ke anusaar rajasthan police ko jaankaree mili he ki match phixing racket kaa mastermind hi arpel ko dharaatal par utaarne ke peeche tha
 Also, his business link is with an Indian player who has played all three formats for the country
 arpel main bhi phixing kii jaanchaaropee player is toornament ke irdagird bhi dekha gaya
 Also in this T20 tournament, many kinds of questions also emerged
 ek udhaaharan ke taur par final main kaante ke mukaable main aakhri overon main ek bowler ne kaaphi dur wide ball karte hue 8 bai die the
 For this reason, the BCCI demanded the Rajasthan Police to investigate the league

 According to the investigating team, they are getting the tournament on the lines of league reality show

 Spotters and handlers are also present in these leagues to carry out match fixing

 After Ahmed Patel's Rajya Sabha election victory in Gujarat, the Congress is now focusing on the Gujarat Assembly elections
 ranneeti ke tahat party ne rajeev gandhi ke janmdin par in vidhayakon ko dilli bulaayaa
 During this time special care was taken that all mlas and leaders should be shown united
 iske liye vidhayakon ko do bason main airport se gujarat bhawan laayaa gaya
 It was also decided that all the mlas will accompany these buses in all the official places
 bas main baithe netaaon ne 'aaj tak' se kaha ki ve dilli main jahaan bhi jaaenge or isi tarah ekasaath jaaenge
 mlas met sonia-rahul on Patel's birthday, followed by Ahmed Patel on August 21, on Ahmed Patel's birthday, with Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi led by Ahmed Patel, in-charge Ashok Gehlot, state president Bharat Singh Solanki and Shakti Singh Gohil
 sonia or rahul ne sabhi vidhayakon ko rajyasabha chunaav kii ekajutata ko banaaye rakhte hue vidhansabha chunaavon main party ko jeet dilaane ko kaha
 On the slogan of Navrajan Gujarat and the true day, the mlas and leaders gave their slogan to Sonia and Rahul that they will go among the people with the slogan of 'navajrajan Gujarat' and 'not good, true day'
 darasal,gujarat congreska maananaa he ki 18 se 35 saal ke naujavaanon ne congress kaa raaj rajya main dekha nahin he
 That is why the slogan of Navajrasan Gujarat means the rise of the new Gujarat
 saath hi ahamed patel ke rajyasabha chunaav kii jeet ko sachai kii jeet bataakar gujarat main 'achche nahin, sachche din' kaa naaraa istemaal kiya jayega
 After Rahul's rally in Balsad on 1 September, after this, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi told all the mlas, 'I myself will come to rally in Nalaponda, Balsad from 1 September in Gujarat for the cooperation of you and to strengthen the Congress's election campaign
 
 rahul ke bayaan ne ek baar phir ye saaf kar diya ki gujarat main wo bhi siyaasi ladaai gujarat congress banaam mukhyamantri vijay roopani kii rahe or rahul banaam modi naa hone paae
 BJP had given Rs 25 crore offer to mlas
 After meeting with Parsonia and Rahul, Congress leader Shakti Singh Gohil said, 'our poor mlas were offered Rs 25 crore and BJP ticket till the last night of Rajya Sabha election
 hamaare vidhayakon ne ye sab rahul or sonia ji ko bataaya
 While referring to the battle of Gujarat, Gohil said that only the Gujarat Congress will defeat the Gujarat BJP in Gujarat
 josh main he gujarat congresshamad patelke janmdin par ratribhoj ke baad 22 agast ko sabhi vidhayak tirupati mandir darshan ke liye ravaanaa honge
 Overall, out of power in Gujarat for a long time, the Congress has been enthused by the victory of a Rajya Sabha, but it has to be remembered that the victory of the Rajya Sabha is largely a victory of the management, in which the votes were to be given to the mlas of his own party
 jabaki, vidhansabha chunaav main to vot janata ko karnaa he

 The general election is knocking 2019 and the constituents of the NDA, sitting silent for the last four years, are becoming vocal
 abhi mangalvaar ko hi endie ke pramukh ghatak dal lok janashakti party ke ramvilas paswan ne desh kii saamaajik sthiti par bayaan dete hue kaha ki vah na to maujuuda samay main bijepi ke bandhua majdoor hai or na hi vah pehle kabhi lalu prasad yadav kii argedy ke saath gathbandhan ke vakt bandhua majdoor the
 The LJP is not the only thinker among the NDA constituents
 algepi pramukh paswan ne nitish kumaar kii bihar ko vishesh darja die jane kii maang kaa thos samarthan kiya he
 Paswan said that Nitish Kumar's demand is completely justified and that the alliance should not be hurt by his demand in any way
 lihaaja, paswan or nitish ke is aapasi talmail kaa saaf sanket he ki endie main bijepi ko chunauti milane kaa agaaj ho chukaa he or use ab samaj lenaa chahie ki gathbandhan ke ghatak is chunavi saal main beete chaar saal kii tarah mook darshak nahin ban kar rahenge
 Significantly, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has repeated the demand for special status for the state at a time when the Modi government at the Center has put the entire process of special status on hold
 modi sarkaar ke is rukh ke chalate isse pehle use andhrapradesh main endie ke ek pramukh ghatak telugu desham party or dakshin main uske chamatkaari netritv chandrababu naidu se haath dhonaa padaa he
 This demand of Nitish Kumar is passing on to the top BJP leaders also
 bijepi netaaon kii daleel he ki 15 vitt ayog kii siforeeshon ke baad kisi rajya dwaara vishesh rajya ke darje kii maang karnaa puri tarah bebuniyaad he
 It is worth noting that the 15th Finance Commission has recently questioned the status of special state and recommended that in view of the existing center-state economic relations, special status is no longer important
 ise padhein: modi nahin, yogi ke sir phutegaa kairana-nurpur main haar kaa thikra, badhengi mushkilenlihaaja, bijepi netritv ko nitish kii is maang ke peeche ramvilas paswan or rashtriya lok samta party ke netaa upendra kushvaha ke bich badhati dosti nagavar guzar rahi he
 Significantly, recently, Kushwaha and Nitish Kumar met, after which this new voice of Ramvisal Paswan has been heard on Nitish's demand for special status
 endie ke ghatak dalon main jari is khinchataan ke paripekshya main 2014 loksabhaa chunaavon ke nateezon ko dekhen to- bihar kii 40 siton main 31 seat endie ke khate main gai or isamen bijepi ke haath 22 siten lagi
 At the same time, except for the BJP in the constituents of NDA, the other parties had to be satisfied with 9 seats
 yahi vajah he ki ab 2019 chunaavon ke thik pehle ek baar phir jediu, algepi or araspi ko sangathit hone kii jarurat mahasoos ho rahi he, jisase endie main bane rahane kii sthiti main vah ekajute hone se 2019 main bijepi se behatar pradarshan kar saken
 However, where this exercise hints at another option apart from strengthening its bargaining in the NDA of the constituents
 gauratlab he ki endie main bijepi ke experiment boy rahe jithan ram maanjhi ne farvari main gathbandhan to chhod diya or behatar raajnneetik kad ke liye ab argedy ke saath jane ke vikalp par chale gaye hai
 At the same time, BJP is facing some such challenge from Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 shivasena ne saaf kar diya he ki 2019 ke chunaavon main vah bijepi ke saath nahin khadi hogi
 And its trailer has shown in this mid-term election including the last assembly election
 lihaaja, endie ke in sabhi ghatak dalon ke saath-saath punjab main akali dal or jammu-kashmir main pidipi bhi is chunavi saal main bijepi se ek kadi saudebaaji karne ke liye taiyaar he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen whether the recent advice from the Akali Dal that the BJP treat its alliance partners well, but the party executes it? jamaat e islamic hind kii is pressvarta main upaadhyaksh nusrat ali or mahasachiv ejeeniyar mohammad saleem va anya padaadhikari maujuud the

 un logon ne unhen maaraa or mrit samajhakar railway patari par phenk diya
 Vijay's brother Ajay Singh said that he had gone to the queen post to register the complaint, the police took the application but did not give any receipt
 yahi nahin, police ne abhi tak maamle main koi karrwai bhi nahin kii he

 They took him to some unknown place and started hitting him with sharp weapons
 sabase zyada waar kulhadi se vijay ke pairon par kiya gaya, jisase pair kai jagahon se cat gaya or doctoron ke liye ise jodna naammumkin sa ho gaya
 So the leg had to be amputated
 'puraani ranjish kaa natijavijay singh yadav ke bhai ne bataaya ki gaanv ke pradhan kishan paal singh yadav se unki kareeb das saal puraani dushmani chali aa rahi he
 Kishan Pal is a domineering village

 Ajay said that due to this enmity, Vijay and Kishan Pal have heard and said many times

 uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav main behad kharaab pradarshan karne vaali basapa kii rashtriya adhyaksh mayawati kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karne vaali thim
 The agenda of the meeting became clear as soon as BSP national general secretary Nasimuddin Siddiqui started shouting slogans around 11 am
 ''bahanji tum sangharsh karo ham tumhaare saath hai", manyavar kanshiram ji amar rahen", jaise chirparichit udghosh ke baad ''voting mashin se chunaav radd karo, radd karo", ''voting mashin se dhaandhlee karne waalo shame karo, shame karo", ''matdaan kii puraani vyavastha behaal karo, behaal karo" jaise naaron ne chunaav main buree haar ke baad mayawati kii ranneeti kii ore ishaara kar diya
 Shortly afterwards, Mayawati arrived at the venue by a red lighted ambassador car surrounded by a dozen commands from all four sides and in her style of reading a written speech, accusing the BJP of rigging electronic voting machines (evms) in the elections and grabbing power Announced the movement of the party
 basapa iviem main dhaandhlee kii kanoonee ladaai kaa nateeja aane tak har maheene kii 11 taarikh ko pradesh ke sabhi jila mukhyalayon par dharna-pradarshan karegi
 The election results for Mayawati are nothing short of a shock
 basapa ko bhale hi 22 fisadi se zyada vot mili lekin 80 vidhayakon vaali party ke 19 siton par simat jane ne ranneetik str par uski kamajori ko jaahir kar diya
 Despite the Election Commission's rejection, Mayawati has announced a statewide agitation as part of a strategy alleging rigging in evms

 Ambedkar Mahasabha President Lalji Nirmal termed this strategy of BSP as diverting attention from real issues
 nirmal kehete hai, ''loksabhaa chunaav ke baad vidhansabha chunaav main dalit matadaataaon kaa ek hissaa lagaataar basapa se chhitak rahaa he, use rokane ke liye mayawati ko jamini muddon ko aadhaar banaakar ranneeti tay kerani chahie
 "apart from 86 reserved assembly seats, Mayawati had fielded Dalit candidates in two other seats but only two could win
 pichley 25 varshon ke dauraan basapa kaa yah sabase kharaab pradarshan he (dekhen box)
 More than that, Suheldev Dalit mlas of Bharatiya Samaj Party and Apna Dal have won
 dalit aadhaar vaali basapa ke liye isse bhi zyada niraashajanak baat yah he ki daliton ke liye arakshit kul 84 vidhansabha siton (do siten anusuchit janajati ke liye arakshit hai) main aadhi se zyada par party duusare sthaan par jagah nahin bana saki
 Yogendra Kumar, a district co-ordinator in Purvanchal, says, "the" floating "vote of the upper castes is not the bsp's main reason for its poor performance in the reserved seats
 muslim matadaataaon par atyadhik focus ne bhi party ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 "mayawati has made Kurmi leader Lalji Verma the leader of the BSP Legislature Party after losing the election to Gaya Charan Dinkar, the leader of the bsp's Legislature Party in the last assembly and the Jatav fraternity leader from Bundelkhand
 99 muslim ummidavaaron ko tikat dena basapa ko baari pad gaya
 This was the first time since independence when a main party fielded Muslim candidates in this number
 rajya main 140 vidhansabha siten aisi hai jinpar muslim matadaataaon kii aabaadi 20 fisadi yaa isse adhik he
 In these seats, BJP on 109, Apna Dal on 2, SP and BSP on 23 had to settle for victory on just two

 mohammad ismail khan kehete hai, ''musalamaanon kaa samarthan paane ke liye basapa kii ranneeti sirf rashtriya mahasachiv nasimuddin siddiki ke iigird hi gumti rahi
 The party failed to create an atmosphere in its favor by not taking forward Muslim leaders at the local level
 "vahiin kabhi basapa ke garh rahe ambedkar nagar jile ke nateezon main mayawati kii puraani soshal ejineering kii safalataa kii jhalak dikhi
 Dalits and extremely backward dominant have won the bsp's mark in three out of five seats in this district, while in the last assembly election it lost all seats
 basapa main ati pichhadi jati ke do sabase bade netaa lalji verma ambedkar nagar kii katehari vidhansabha seat or pradesh adhyaksh ram achal rajbhar akbarpur vidhansabha seat se chunaav jite hai
 Clearly, the Dalit and backward people base is still winning for the BSP

 unhone kaha ki kya desh ke sabhi netaa bhrasht hai or sirf suchi jari karne vaala hi eemaandaar he? 'ham to mukadmaa nahin karnaa chaahate, varanaa unhen jail main daal den
 The SP chief, stung by being named in Kejriwal's list, said, "to accuse someone of corruption, it is necessary to conduct an impartial investigation by any agency and we are proved innocent by the CBI after 17 years long investigation
" have make
 ab jaanch is baat kii honi chahie ki khud ko eemaandaar kehane vaale kejariwal ne naukari kyon chodi, kahin vah bhrashtachar main to lipt nahin the?'mulaayam ne kaha, 'kejariwal ne mujhe bhrasht kaha he, ham to mukadmaa nahin karnaa chaahate hai varanaa unhen jail main daal den
 'give me 70 seats, then look! In this awesome public meeting, Mulayam Singh declared himself' a strong contender for the post of Prime Minister 'from the public forum
 apana mansuba jaahir karte hue unhone kaha ki aaj na bijepi ko or na hi congress ko purna bahumat milegaa
 a Third Front government will be formed at the center and the Samajwadi Party will emerge as the largest party
 sapa mukhiya ne kaha, 'jayalalita ne kaha he ki unki party 40 siten jitkar aa rahi he
 She has only 39 seats in her state while one seat she is talking of coming from elsewhere whereas Uttar Pradesh has 80 seats
 aise main aap sirf 70 siten jita do, phir dekh lo kamaal
 ' world cap 2015 ke liye un 15 khilaadiyon kii lista gai he jo team india ke sir ke taj ko bachaane australia or newjiland jaaenge
 a wave of dissatisfaction is also clearly visible on the team selected for the World Cup, where many veterans appear satisfied
 khaas taur par yuvaraj singh kaa chayan na hone par kai purv cricketer or phans niraash hai
 Not only this, after the team selection, many people doubt whether this team will be able to save the World Cup title or not! These 7 reasons why Yuvraj was left out of the team 'anfit' Jadeja and 'son' Binny in the team Why India? When the World Cup was won in 2011, Captain Cool MS Dhoni had the experienced and unmatched names like Sachin Tendulkar, Yuvraj Singh, Virender Sehwag, Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and Gautam Gambhir in that team
 lekin is baar kii team india us team kii tulana main kaaphi anubhavheen dikhaai detii he
 But there is also no denying that there are some diamonds in this team who can surprise the opponents with their glare
 aaie jaane kyon he team india world cap jeetne kaa daavedaar
 1
 team india ke paas sabase majboot ballebaaji, panchratra par rahegaa daaromadartim india hameshaa apni ballebaaji ke dam par virdohi tiimon kii neenden udaati rahi he
 This time too, the team will have more hope from the batsmen
 beshak is baar sachin, viru, yuvaraj yaa gambhir nahin hai, lekin team india ke paas is samay duniya kaa sabase behtareen ballebaaj viraat kohli he, inke alaava rohit sharma, shikhar dhawan, ajinkya rahane or suresh raina jaise vanade specialist bharat kii sambhaavnaaon ko majboot banaate hai
 If these five batsmen are batting with Dhoni, India can achieve any goal
 2
 If Dhoni runs, he will make Anohni the captain of the Honihar captain to lead his team from the front
 dhoni apni captaini or ballebaaji kaa loha puri duniya main manavaa chuke hai
 This time Dhoni's batting and leadership will decide a lot for the Indian team
 agar dhoni kaa balla chalaa to vah anhoni ko bhi honi kar sakate hai or team india world cap jeet sakati he
 Famous as the world's best finisher, Dhoni will have to play a big role in this World Cup
 vaise bhi dhoni agar yah world cap jeet paane main kaamyaab rahe to unke naam lagaataar do world cap jeetne kaa record bhi darj ho jayega
 Earlier, former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd (1975 and 1979) and Australia's Ricky Ponting (2003 and 2007) have won this honor by winning two consecutive World Cups
 apane naam ke aage dheron uplabdhiyaan jod chuke dhoni is uplabdhi ko paane ke liye bhi har sambhav koshish karenge
 3
 1983 main oleroundaron ne bharat ko jitayaa tha world cap, is baar bhi ummid1983 main kisi ne sochaa nahin tha kii bharat world cap jitegaa, lekin team ke oleroundaron ne karishma karte hue pehali baar bharat ke sir par world cap kaa taj sajaayaa tha
 The contributions of Kapil Dev, Mohinder Amarnath, Roger Binny, Ravi Shastri and Madan Lal are still proudly remembered
 is world cap main bhi bharat ek baar phir apane oleroundaron se kamaal kii ummid karegaa
 Ravindra Jadeja, Akshar Patel, r Ashwin and Stuart Binny will also be expected to perform well with the bat with good bowling
 raina or rohit se bhi ummid hogi ki vah gend se bhi yogadan den
 Except Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma and Mohammed Shami, every player in the team is seen as an all-rounder, which strengthens Team India's claim
 4
 Australia's condition will be helpful for Team India
 With the kind of batting that India has done on Australian pitches in recent days, there is a hope that India can play well there too
 bharat australia main apane zyaadaatar match batting friendli pich par khelegaa
 Also, the World Cup is to be played after the end of Australia's domestic tournament season, so there will be no boom and bounce in the pitches of Australia
 agar aisa hua to team india australia main bhi apni ballebaaji kaa paracham buland kar saktaa he
 5
 gendbaaji kamjor jarur par beasar nahintim india kii sabase kamjor kadi gendbaaji maani jaati he
 But ironically, India does not have better bowlers than this
 test maichon main bharat kii kharaab gendbaaji jarur rahi he lekin vanade cricket alag kism kaa khel he or 50 over main yahi gendbaaj badale-badale hue dikhaai denge
 If Mohammad Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, r Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Akshar Patel were able to perform a little better than their average, then Team India could once again become the World Champion by surprise

 The Hindu newspaper The Hindu wrote quoting sources from the monastery that Rahul Gandhi's program was scheduled long back, which is why the chief masters were not available when Amit Shah arrived

 The Qurba community has more than 80 monasteries

 The current Chief Minister Siddaramaiah comes from this community
 rajya main kurba aabaadi 8 fisadi he
 This is the reason that meeting and not meeting the main owner here also has great political significance
 mathon kaa karnataka kii raajnneeti par asar kitna zyada he, is baat kaa andaja rahul gandhi or amit shah ke dauron se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In every tour, both leaders are not forgetting to visit the rallies as well as the monasteries
 lingayat samudaay kii maang maanakar congress ne ek bada daanv khelaa he, kyonki karnataka main sabase zyada asardaar math lingayat samudaay ke hi hai
 In such a situation, Amit Shah is also trying hard to gain support by visiting the monasteries belonging to the OBC community

 In the days of desperation, he always remembered his mother's advice: 'twelve years, even the days of garbage are changed, son, you are a human being
 ' maa kii naseehat or mehnat ke boote navaj bollywood ke dilnavaaj adaakaar ban gaye hai
 On the birthday of this actor, let us know some special things about him: 1
 navazuddinka janm 19 may 1974 ko uttar pradesh ke mujffarnagar jile ke ek chote se gaanv 'budhaanaa' main hua or unke pita ek kisaan hai
 2

 4
 navaj ne haridwar ke college se grajuation karke ek chemist kii naukari bhi kii thi lekin us kaam main unka man nahin laga or iske kaaran unhone yah naukari chhod di
 He then took Nawaz's admission in Delhi's famous 'national School of Drama (NSD)' and completed his graduation in 1996
 5
 In 2004, Nawazuddin Mayanagari reached Mumbai with strong intentions and his skills, but his year was full of strut
 jeb main ghar kaa kiraaya dene tak ke paise nahin the or navaj ne apane enesdy ke ek senior se panaah maangi us senior ne ghar or kiraaya share kiya lekin shart rakhi keenavajko hi khaanaa pakaana padegaa

 7
 navaj ne mumbai main kai tivi serials ke liye bhi tri kiya lekin koi safalataa hasil nahin hui
 8
 navazuddin ne film 'munnabhai MBBS' main ek chota sa role bhi nibhaayaa tha
 In the beginning of this film, he played the role of a pickpocket
 9
 Nawaz had no work between the years 2003 and 2005 and during those days of Gurbat, Nawaz had to share his room with four people
 un dinon navaj kabhi-kabhi acting workshop chalaakar jaise taise guzaara kiya karte the
 10
 navazuddin ne anuraag kashyap kii 'blike friday' or 'dev di' main chote-chote role adaa kiye lekin baad main film 'neuyork' main unke abhinay ke liye kaaphi saraahna mili
 11
 navaj ne saal 2010 main aamir khan ke production main bani film 'pipli live' main ek patrkaar kii bhoomika nibhaai jiske liye unke kirdaar ko kaaphi saraahaa gaya
 12
 sujoy ghosh kii film 'kahani' ke baad navaj darshakon kii najaron main aane lage
 The biggest change in Nawaz's career came with Anurag Kashyap's film Gangs of Wasseypur
 is film main navaj ne faijal naam ke kirdaar ko jeevant kiya jiske dialog logon ke jumba par aaj bhi aa jate hai
 13
 navazuddin ne salmaan khan ke saath film 'bajrangi bhaijan' or 'kik' main bhi ahm kirdaar adaa kiya

 is saal relies hui film 'badlapur' main bhi navaj ke kirdaar ko darshakon kaa pyaar mila
 Nawazuddin, who is doing many films with many big stars, keeps the audience waiting on the big screen
 14
 Nawaz wanted to become a badminton player since childhood, but due to injuries in the knee, he remained unfulfilled and became an actor
 kal british company vodaphone kii bhartiya unit vodaphone india or aditya birla group kii company idia celular ne marjar kaa elaan kar telecom sector kii sabase badi khabar di thi
 The two companies can come together and emerge as India's No
 1 telecom company
 isse inke graahakon ke phaayde main rahane ke puure asaar najar aar rahe hai
 Reliance Jio has come into the telecom market and has given rise to such competition that the telecom giants who are already piling up had to save the roof over their heads
 shaayad jeeyo na hota to is vilay kii kahani bhi na hoti
 Now that Idea and Vodafone have become one, only a few companies including Reliance Jio, Airtel, idea-vodafone are left
 or pichhali khabaron ke mutabik BSNL-MTNL bhi ek hone ja raheen hai
 In such a situation, we hope that customers will benefit from the increase in cut throat competition
 HP-PVR milakar noida main launch karenge asia kaa pehla VR lounjaaye ho sakate hai phaayde:nae ofer ke saath jeeyo kar saktaa he palatwaramrjar ke baad donon ke customers ko jod kar sabase zyada graahak inke hisse main ho gaye hai
 Those who are more than Jio, because of this, Jio will get a competition of equality
 lekin jeeyo kii puraani harkaton se aisa abhas hota he ki kahin jeeyo phir palatwaar karte huekoi nayaa or damdaar offran pesh kar de
 After Price Warrieliance Jio introduced a welcome offer, Happy New Year offer and promised to always keep calling free
 in ophers ne price war ko ek alag hi level de diya
 Now that Vodafone and Idea have come together, as well as Reliance Communication will also make every effort to stay in the market, it is decided that in this price war, telecom services can become cheap
 behatar networkadonon companiyon ke vilay ke baad idia or vodaphone kaa network ek ho jayega, isse puri ummid he ki graahakon ko behatar network connactivity milegi
 This service of Jio will be free even after April 1, pick up beneficial offers Idea and after the Vodafone merger, both companies will work together, there is a chance as well
 mauka bilkul bhunaaya jayega or loklubhaavan plance kii barsaat ho sakati he
 Does anyone know their welcome offer! There is a possibility of improving the service quality
 You may not have to face problems like call drop and slow network in the coming time
 kyonki vodaphone or idia ek hone ke baad ek duusare kii sansadhano kaa upyog karengi isseunaki laagat kamahogi or donon kii technology ek ho jane se graahakon ko dabl phayda ho jaae
 Competition does not stop here as Reliance Communication, Aircel, Tata Tele Services and MTS can together form a big company and Bharti Airtel has already bought Telenor's Indian business
 aise main kaha ja saktaa he ki pikchar to abhi baaki he, dekho telecom companiyon ke khajaane se abhi graahakon ke liye or kya-kya nikalataa he

 Biker gang was seen in Delhi on Wednesday night
 puri raat sadakon par saikadon kii taadaat main bike savaar gum rahe the
 On one hand, their speed was very fast, on the other hand they were driving the vehicle very dangerously
 koi ek pahie ke bal stant dikhaa rahaa tha to koi bike par khadey hokar chalaa rahaa tha
 The most surprising thing was that it was coming in front of the subpolis and the police just kept looking like helpless
 darasal bikers kii sankhya itani zyada thi ki koi bhi pulicekarmi bich sadak par ja kar unhen rokane kii koshish nahin kar paa rahaa tha
 Hundreds of bike riders were speeding out in front of the policemen, showing stunts and making noise
 hai security viipi ilaake main huddangbikers kahundangaur kahin nahin, dilli ke sabase hai security jone nai dilli main ho rahaa tha or yah sab india get ke cirkil se lekar conot place or aas-paas ke sabhi viviipi ilaake ke paas ho rahaa tha
 In fact, the bike riders were driving in such a dangerous way that the people running around them were nervous and lost their balance
 ek parivaar to chotil hote-hote bachaa
 When the police awakened bikers ran away, after several hours of fighting, when the Delhi Police came in its form, then the bikers got involved
 dilli police ne ek saath kai jagahon par bairicading laga di or force lekar bich sadak par utar ai
 Suddenly, the bikers are coming from the front, caught in the clutches of Delhi Police
 jab pakade gaye tab gidgidaejaise hi police waalon ne bikers ko pakadaa to unke tevar naram ho gaye koi maafee maangane laga to koi dobaaraa aisa na karne kii baat kah kar chhod dene kii maang karne laga lekin police ne ek naa suni
 Police recovered the bikers and seized their vehicles
 der raat tak police ne 20 se zyada bikers ko pakad liya tha
 However, many have already changed their ways after seeing the police barricades
 badlaav kii bayaar se bhartiya samaaj ab achoota nahin rah gaya he
 Especially the views of young men and women of the country are completely changed
 haal hi main ek survey ke dauraan yah baat saamne ai ki ab ladakiyon main virgin hasband kii chahat kam hoti ja rahi he
 Girls were asked a question in different cities
 yuvatiyon se poocha gaya ki kya ve virgin hasband chahengi? is sawaal ke jo jawaab aae, ve bahut-kuch sochane ko majaboor kar dete hai
 Some girls said very clearly that they want a husband who does not already have any 'experience'
 par kai ladakiyon ke jawaab ekadam chaunkaane vaale rahe
 Someone said that she does not think of the virgin husband, because she knows very well where the world is going today
 shaadi hone tak 'intjaar karne' kaa sabar har kisi main nahin hota, natijatan vivaah se pehle sex bade shaharon main aam hota ja rahaa he
 The trend of live-in is also increasing day by day
 kisi ne kaha ki unhen is baat se koi fark nahin padataa ki unka hone vaala pati virgin ho yaa nahin
 Somebody also said with great impunity that both girls or boys are taking every kind of decision about themselves
 aise main agar koi vayask shaadi se pehle apni marji kisi se sexual relation banaata he, to isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
