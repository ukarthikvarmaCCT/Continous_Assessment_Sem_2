 RJD including Bihar's main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over Nitish does not want to leave any stone unturned to surround Nitish in the name of fodder scam

 Though the affidavit will be heard on November 22, but JD (U) 's 17-year-old fellow BJP as well as opposition parties have already started to surround Nitish with the fodder scam

 Soon everything will be revealed
 kanoon main der ho saktaa he par andher nahin

 bihar kii purv mukhyamantri rabari devi ne bhi somvaar ko aarope lagaaya tha ki nitish or shivanand bhrashtachar main lipt hone ke baad bhi satta main bane hue hai
 RJD leaders allege that when Lalu Prasad can be found guilty in the fodder scam without any concrete evidence, why not Nitish? While both have been accused of taking money in the fodder scam
 ullekhneey he ki mithilesh kumaar singh kii piiel par ucch nyaayalay ne sibiai ko ek halafanama daakhil kar yah bataane ke liye kaha he ki nitish or shivanand par mukadmaa kyon nahin chalaaya jaae

Having a Sadhvi in the BJP cabinet, even if she is a junior minister of pickles and chutneys, and i believe her senior Akali Dal's Harsimrat Kaur oversees the departments of jams and juices, is very comforting to liberals

 Here i would like to mention the article (liberals Are Raining America, i Know Because i am One) by the American liberal scholar Steve Almond, published in the New York Times on June 8, 2012, this week of liberal sadism, tone, solitude, mourning or India
 In the idiom, we were forced to cry or wash in Punjabi
 almond ne likhaa he ki 2006 main tatkaaleen videsh mantri condolija rice ko camencement spikar chune jane ke virodh main boston college main shikshak kii naukari chhodkar unhone udaaravaadi shahadat hasil kii thi
 He says its biggest reward was an invitation to Fox News to take account in a boisterous right-wing fourshow and at the time he thought he had repaid his liberal debt by combating the vile, screaming anchor Sien Hanity
 unhone aage likhaa he ki 2012 tak apane is karname par garv kam hone laga, ‘‘maine satta se sach nahin bolaa tha or na hi kisi ko rice kaa record nae sire se jaanchane par majaboor kiya tha
 i only provided excitement to Fox News for a few minutes
 apni naitik shreshthata siddh karne ke chakkar main maine hanity kii takat badhaai
 "if we remember America of 2012, the south-left was polarizing throughout American society
 par 2014 main modi shashan ke chah maheene baad bharat kii sthiti main bahut samanta he
 Almond's assessment of himself fits on us as well
 unhone likhaa he, ‘‘sidhi jabaan main kahen to yah america udaarvaad kii traasad khami he
 We considered ourselves innocent victims of growing right-wing fundamentalism
 vastav main aksar ham usamen or usase hamaare samaaj main ai vikruti main hissedaar hai
 "then he wrote," We unwittingly share the right, Conservative idiots as a means of mass entertainment
 ’’pashchimi loktantric deshon main udaarvaadiyon ko haashie par dhakele jane ke kaarnon main gahare utarana mere liye kathin kaam he, kyonki main un samaajon ko utani acchhee tarah nahin jaanata
 But deeply ingrained in liberalism in India, the issue is further complicated by Khanty elitism
 main varshon se chilla rahaa hum ki rajnatik drushti se ham udaarvaadiyon kaa dayera sikud rahaa he kyonki aazaadee ke baad vah vampanth ke saath jud gaya he
 Our national ideology emerged from the independence movement was very liberal
 uske baad congress ne itane vishaal rajnatik chhatnar vriksh kaa rup liya jisamen vam or dakshin, donon ke udaarvaadiyon ke liye paryaapt jagah thi or unhen tark karne ke liye bauddhik swatantraaa bhi thi
 We have to remember that Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was a member of the Nehru cabinet and Sardar Patel was his deputy prime minister
 lekin agle do dashakon main nehru ne kalakaari se or uske baad unki beti ne krurta se dakshinpanthiyon kaa safaya kar diya
 In this way the only real liberal party of India became the left-liberal party
 is bare main zyada jaanane ke liye ramchandra guha ko padhie
 But people of my generation c
 rajagopalaachari kaa sitara nishaan aaj bhi yaad he, jisamen puraani congress ke dakshinpanthi ekajute hokar jabardast vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe the
 In 1967, he got 44 Lok Sabha seats
 indira gandhi ne 1969 ke baad unhen or bharat ke udaar-dakshinpanth ko mitti main mila diya
 As a result, liberalism became the legacy of the left
 kyonki dakshinpanth ne bhagava chola pahan liya tha
 This trend lasted as long as the old, anti-imperialist, non-aligned and terror-stricken West of the Cold War dominated Indian politics and public thinking
 lekin? shityudh samaapt hone, vaishvik satta or aarthik sameekaran nae sire se tay hone or aakankshaon se bhare, mahatvakankshi, adheer or vaicharik jakadaaa se mukt bharatiyon kii ek ke baad ek ubhartee peedi kii nai sachaaiyon ke anusaar dhalane kaa lacheelaapan usamen nahin tha
 i cannot say for sure that Manmohan Singh would have thought that way
 lekin 1991 ke baad ve shaayad puraane jamaane ke sabase mashhoor udaaravaadi the jinhone sochaa ki ab vampanth se judaav khatm karne kaa samay aa gaya he
 By the middle of 2009, for the second time with a larger mandate, he was winning this campaign of ideological reform
 lekin party kii ridh main dhase rodhak system ne unhen haraa diya
 Popular sociology has its own dangers, but i have been escaping often before, so i am adventurous this time too
 manmohan main yah sweekaar karne kii bauddhik eemaandaaree thi yaa unke rajnatik guru narsingh raav ke shabdon main kahen, ‘‘jab pairon tale jameen khisak rahi ho to kya karen,’’ phir bhi ve yah nahin dekh paae ki unke vampanthi-udaarvaad kii jaden bahut pakke kulinavaad main jami hui hai
 To be liberal, it was necessary to be a leftist and if you were to be called a left-liberal then your parents should be very rich, who taught you at doon-stephens-oxford and inherited Delhi Golf Club membership with the capital's elite , Must have left a house in rich neighborhoods such as diplomatic enclaves
 manmohan singh or raav is sachaai ko nahin dekh paae isliye asafal rahe
 That is why liberals have returned to their leftist but aristocratic bills or perhaps Ivory Bunker
 bunker hi kyon, tower kyon nahin, us par abhi baat karenge
 It is now a high-ranking Brahminical club (I refer only to its intellectual traits, not to Manuwadi thinking), which is forbidden from outside

 ES&S said in a statement to The Verge, "between 2000 and 2006 the company provided pcanywhere remote connection software to some customers for technical support, but the software was not intended for a voting machine
 EAC kii guideline ke baad 2007 main company ne pcanywhere dena band kar diya or koi bhi ES&S customer ise yuj nahin karata

 The Railway Board convened a review meeting 36 hours after the horrific rail accident near Kanpur
 chairman railway board e ke mittal kii aguwai main bulaai gai is meeting main railway board ke sabhi 7 member maujuud rahe
 In this meeting, which lasted for 3 hours, questions were raised about safety and security in the railways
 board meeting main kanpur ke paas hue bheeshan rail haadase ke bare main bhi charchaa hui is rail haadase main hue ghatnakram ko dekhte hue railway board ne kai ahm faisle liye
 The biggest decision in these decisions is that the production of LHB coaches of German technology will be increased rapidly as well as the existing ICF coaches will be fitted with either the Saku coupler or the CBC coupler
 railway ke ek aalaa afasar ke mutabik railway kisefti wingko or zyada majboot karne kaa faisla liya gaya baithak main kaha gaya ki alag-alag divijan or railway coridor kaa samay-samay par sefti audit bhi kiya jayega iske liye nijee kshetra se sefti visheshgyon ko bhi joda jayega
 Factual information about all aspects of the respective railway corridors will be collected in the safety audit and appropriate suggestions will also be made for this
 railway board ne rail haadason ke khatre ko kam karne ke liye yah faisla liya he ki un rail margon par jinako 100 phisadi istemaal kiya ja rahaa he vahaan par koi bhi nai railgadee nahin chalaai jaaegi
 There was also a discussion about the ICF coach used in the Indore Patna Express at the Railway Board meeting
 jaankaron ke mutabik kanpur ke paas hue rail haadase main marane vaale logon kii sankhya itani zyada hone ke peeche sabase badi vajah he ki isamen puraani takanic par bane isief coach lage hue hai
 The technology of these coaches is outdated
 durghatana hone kii sthiti main aise dibbe ek duusare ke upar chadh jate hai or ek duusare ko tod dete hai kuch aisa hi kanpur ke paas hue rail haadase main hua he
 There are 53 thousand ICF coaches in all trains running across the country
 lihaaja railway board neisief dibbonmen kapaling badalane kaa faisla kiya he in dibbon main saaku kapler yaa sibisi kapler lagaae jaaenge
 Apart from this, in the Railway Board meeting, it has also been decided to install ultrasonic flow detector along the tracks for correct examination of all rail tracks across the country
 jaankaron ke mutabik deshbhar main rail patariyon ke kinare-kinare is takanic ke sensor lagaae jane se patari main hui kisi bhi tut foot ke bare mensambandhitarailway ko samay se jaankaree mil paaegi jisase is tarah ke bheeshan haadason se bachaa ja sakegaa aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki har kilometre kii rail patari ke kinare ultrasonic detector lagane kii keemat 8 se 10 lakh rupye padegi
 Along with this, information about maintenance block for repair of railway corridor will be given in railway time table
 mentanence block kii samay avadhi main sambandhit railway karidor main railgadiyon kii awajahi band kar di jaaegi or vahaan kii puri marammat ho jane ke baad hi railway trek ko open kiya jayega
 The impact of the Modi government's decision to discontinue 500 and 1000 notes is still visible
 logon ko raahat nahin mili he or ve bainkon-atm ke saamne lambii-lambii kataron main lage dikh rahe hai
 Whether it is ATM or bank, the lines are not taking the name of shortage
 is bich khabar ye bhi aa rahi he ki kuch log apane bujurg maa-pita yaa chote bacchon ko jariya banaakar line main khadey hone se batch rahe hai

 Earlier, on a statement by PM Narendra Modi, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar made DNA a big issue before the 2015 assembly elections
 ab ek baar phir nitish kumaar se endie ke sahyogi dal araspi adhyaksh upendra kushvaha ne unka diene poocha he
 After all, what is the political reason for the whole battle of DNA? Let me tell you that in the India Today State of State Conclave on Saturday, when Chief Minister Nitish Kumar sought feedback from Upendra Kushwaha on his statement about him, he (nitish) said that the question- Taking the level of answers down so much
 nitish kii isi baat par upendra kushvaha ke tevar sakht ho gaye hai
 Taking a dig at Nitish Kumar on Sunday, he asked him that the people of the state want to know from you what the report of your 'DNA' is and whether it came or not
 aayi to kya report he, jaraa bataane kaa kaam kiijie?upendra kushvaha ne is bayaan ko sirf diene tak hi simit nahin rakhaa balki dalit-obisi se joda he
 He said that Nitish Kumar calls me 'neech'
 main is manch se bade bhai nitish kumaar se poochna chahta hum ki upendra kushvaha isliye 'neech' he, kyonki vah dalit-pichhadaa or garib naujavaanon ko ucchtam nyaayalay main jaj bananaa chahta he
 He said, 'we raise the talk of backward and very backward and their interests are therefore low
 saamaajik nyaay kii baat karte hai isliye upendra kushvaha neech he
 How do Upendra Kushwaha, who campaigns for the children of poor families, campaign for this? vaise hi 2015 ke chunaav pehle mujffarpur main parivartan raily main kaha tha ki kumaar kaa diene kuch gadabad he
 On this statement of PM, Nitish Kumar raised the issue of Bihar identity to surround this BJP and Modi
 bihar ke vidhansabha chunaav 2015 se se thik pehle nitish kumaar ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye bihar ke lakhon logon ke bal bataur sample bheje the
 Taking a dig at Modi, Nitish had said that with this sample, he should do DNA test of the people of Bihar
 nitish ke is daanv se bijepi baikfoot par thi
 The BJP also suffered losses during the assembly elections
 haalanki ab nitish ke daanv se hi kushvaha unhen raajnneetik maat dena chaahate hai
 Kushwaha is not happy about the seat sharing among the NDA in Bihar
 wo 2019 ke loksabhaa main pichley chunaav kii tulana main kam siton par katai nahin maanane ko raji nahin he
 Actually, Kushwaha has both options open
 ek ore to vah endie main hai hin
 On the other hand, Tejashwi Yadav has also openly invited him
 yahi vajah he ki kushvaha maukey par chaukaa maarane kii firaaq main he
 Therefore, he is raising the issue of DNA, understanding the fragility of time
 upendra kushvaha kabhi nitish kumaar kii tarif karte hai to kabhi unke khilaaf main hallaa bolte hai
 This is the reason why political pundits say that Upendra Kushwaha is waiting for the climax
 tabhi jaakar vah apane siyaasi pattey kholenge
 If sources are to be believed, at present, it has been agreed between Amit Shah and Nitish Kumar that JDU and BJP will contest 17-17 seats
 vahiin ramvilas paswan kii party algepi ko 4 siten di jaaengi or upendra kushvaha kii araspi ko 2 seat milegi
 However, LJP won 7 seats in the last Lok Sabha election
 vahiin, upendra kushvaha kii party ko 3 siten mili thi or in teenon siton par kushvaha kii party ne jeet darj kii thi
 This is the reason why Upendra Kushwaha is constantly making statements while living in NDA

 i can call a Legislature Party meeting at any time and go to the Raj Bhavan (to present a claim)
 main iske liye intjaar kar rahaa hum
 He said that it was possible only with the blessings and cooperation of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh that he rose from taluk to state level to become the Chief Minister
 unhone kaha ki main aglaa kadam uthaane se pehle sangh parivaar ke bado se aashirwad lene yahaan aayaa hum
 The BJP Parliamentary Board is likely to meet in Delhi on Wednesday to approve Yeddyurappa in relation to forming the government

 Sayings of rats jumping and playing kabaddi in the stomach are common, but do you know that kabaddi is actually bacteria rather than rats in the stomach
 aapke man main motopa kam karne kii ichha he, lekin aap khud ko charbi or vasayukta bhojan khaane se roak nahin pate? vastav main yah aapaki jubaan kii nahin balki aapke pet main paae jane vaale bacteria ke kaaran hota he
 a recent study has revealed that the bacteria found in our stomach control our brains and arouse our interest towards certain foods
 vigyaan patrika ‘bioeses’ ke taaja ank main prakashit ek adhyayan main anusandhankartaaon ne kaha he ki insaan ke pet main paae jane vaale ‘microbs’ manushyon kii khaane se sambandhit ruchiyon ko prabhavit karte hai
 In fact, these microbes motivate humans to eat things that help them to flourish more
 america ke san francisco sthit california vishvavidhyalay ke carlo maile ne apane shodhpatr main kaha he, ‘hamaari aanton main paae jane vaale bacteria hamaari khaane kii aadaton ko prabhavit karte hai
 According to researchers, microbiomes found in the human intestine contain bacteria associated with human food interests that secrete certain substances that transmit signals that affect our decisions about food
 chunki hamaari aant hamaare pratirohak tantra, antasravi tantra or nerve system se bhi judi hoti he, isliye aant main in jeevanuon dwaara chode gaye sanket hamaari shaareerik or vyaavhaarik pratikriyaaon ko bhi prabhavit karte hai
 Researchers, however, have also stated that not eating substances that can be easily digested by these bacteria can affect the compatibility of these bacteria
 aisa karke ham 24 ghante main microbiom main badlaav kar sakate hai
 The Shiv Sena, which is a boast of discipline and rules, is taking on the politics of nepotism and sycophancy
 is baat kaa dard ek saarvajanik manch par maharashtra ke pashusanvardhan mantri ke bhaashanon kaa chhalak bhi aayaa
 In the presence of the party chief, he also made a sarcasm by keeping the inside of the party in front of everyone, 'shiv Sena has many more kettles than tea
 ' Gulabrao Patil said in his speech that now the days are for elections
 tikat bantwaaraa bahut sanbhalkar hona chahie
 But, it has been seen that who is seen more than who is giving tickets, who is alien
 kyonki yahaan chaay se zyada kettliyaan garam ho chuki hai
 The comments patil kaa saafe rukh un netaaon kii taraf tha jo chunaav main ummidavaari dete hue party ke saath nishtha ke bajaae kaaryakarta kii khud kii taraf nishtha ko ehmiyat dete hai
 Patil bluntly told such leaders that he had to pay the price for the dishonesty of the Shiv Sena
 gauratlab he ki is bayaanbazi ke dauraan shivasena ke party pramukh uddhav thakare manch par maujuud the

 Ticket distribution should be very careful
 lekin, ho ye rahaa he ki tikat dete vakt koun apana, koun paraayaa zyada dekha ja rahaa he
 Because there are more kettles than tea
 tippaniyan Patil's clear stance was on the part of the leaders who, while giving candidature in the election, preferred the worker's loyalty to himself rather than loyalty to the party
 aise netaaon ko patil ne do took kaha ki shivasena se jis-jisane beyimaani kii unhen uski keemat chukaani padi he
 Significantly, during this statement, Shiv Sena party chief Uddhav Thackeray was present on the stage

 in pariwaron kii pahchaan ke liye sarkaar ne unke gharon par mote-mote aksharon main 'main garib hum’ likhva diya tha
 These families had been bearing the burden of this prayer for the last two and a half years and were suffering the poverty as well as its stigma
 29 agast, 2012 ke ank main india today ne bipiel pariwaron kii is vyathaa ko uthaaya to shashan-prashasan ko apni galati kaa ehsaas hua

 ’’ gauratlab he ki purv niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak :kaig: ve ke shungalu ko rashtramandal khelon main hui kathith aniyamittaaon kii jaanch ke liye banaai samiti kaa adhyaksh niyukt kiya gaya he 
 Kalmadi stressed that the organizing committee is not responsible for the construction and other works done for these games from anywhere
 unhone kaha, ‘‘aayojan samiti 1800 karod rupe ke liye jimmedaar thi 
 We have no role in the construction and other work done in the stadium
 ham keval in 1800 karod rupe ke liye jawaab de sakate hai 
 Kalmadi said that international teams who had arrived in Guangzhou for the Asian Games praised the Commonwealth Games and its opening and closing ceremony
 unhone kaha, ‘‘lekin main media dwaara lagaataar nakaaratmak prachaar se dukhi hum 
 It is unfortunate for the media to decide on its own
 ham har sawaal kaa jawaab dene ke liye taiyaar hai 
 i have always said that there should be investigation
 ’’ landan main hue queens beton riley main kathith vittiya aniyamittaaon ke sambandh main aayojan samiti ke do purv adhikari ties darbari or sanjay mahendru ko giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he 
 In this regard, Kalmadi said that these two officers had already been expelled from the organizing committee
 unhone kaha, ‘‘bhrashtachar kii khabaron ke baad aayojan samiti unke khilaaf pehle hi karrwai kar chuki he
 The CEO of the organizing committee (jarnail Singh) has already ended his services
 ’’ kalmari ne saath hi asian khelon main kaansya padak jeetne vaale jimnast ashish kumaar, tairaak virdhaval khaade or vushu khilaadi bikramjit singh kii prashansa kii 
 He said, "this is a great achievement and we are proud of them
 isse sabit hota he ki hamaara desh khelon main teji se aage bad rahaa he or sahi disha main ja rahaa he 
 We must maintain this rhythm
 ’ Thursday night will be remembered in the history of Samajwadi Party
 kyonki ye sankat mulaayam singh ke saamne ab tak kaa sabase bada sakant he
 Rar stems from the 96-hour-old nephew not taking the name of the pause
 72 ghante baad mulaayam singh ke hastkshep ke baad lag rahaa tha ki maamla ab kuch sudharne vaala he lekin ye or bighad gaya
 In fact, around 7:30 pm on Thursday evening, his nephew and his uncle Shivpal reach the UP KCM Akhilesh Yadav's house to meet him
 sutron kii maane to is mulaakaat main kuch sulatata na dekh shivpal waapas aate hai or sapariwaar party or cabinet se istipha de dete hai
 It then begins a highvoltage drama outside the SP and Shivpal's house in Lucknow
 
 
 
 1
 jaise hi istife dene kii khabar li hui vaise hi shivpal ke ghar ke baahar samarthakon kaa jamaavada lag gaya or jabardast tareeke se narebaaji hone lagi
 2
 shivpal ke samarthakonki taadaad main vidhayak, mantri, gali or gaanv ke netaa hai
 The gathering grew large enough to support this land-related leader
 3
 Uncle you struggle we are with you
 upi kii majaburi he shivpal yadav jaruri he
 
 
 As the slogans echoed the atmosphere around Shivpal's house
 4
 After a while Shivpal came out of the house and he told him that you guys should go now and go to sleep
 5
 Sloganeering intensified
 phir iske baad shivpal ne do kaaryakartaaon kaa haath pakadakar kaha ki aap jaaie
 Believe us we are with you and we will do whatever you say
 abhi aap bhi jaaie or aaraam kariye
 6
 chachaa ham nahin jaaenge
 
 
 
 bhaiya ham nahin jaaenge jaise bol phir sunai dene lage
 About ten minutes later Shivpal went inside
 or unke samarthakon kii bheed thodi chantane lagi
 7
 subah hote hi phir samarthakon kii bheed ghar ke baahar jutane lagi
 And the atmosphere became like night again
 8
 According to reports, nearly two dozen mlas have reached outside the house of the Governor
 par abhi sidhe tareeke se koi saamne nahin aa rahaa
 9
 subah paune das baje shivpal apane ghar se baahar nikle or apane samarthakon se kaha ki netaji jo kahenge wo hi main karuunga
 10
 hameshaa kii tarah unhone kaha ki main netaji kaa har aadesh maanoonga or unke kisi bhi aadesh ko main chunauti nahin duungaa
 Today we have a conversation with him
 maamla sab sulajh jayega
 Do not worry
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne switzraland kii dawa company novartis agi kii cancer rodhi dawa glivek ke patent se sambandhit yachika khaarij kar di he
 a bench of Justices Aftab Alam and Ranjana Prakash Desai dismissed Novartis' plea
 padhein:cancer ke liye jimmedaar jin mila!company ne bauddhik sampada apiliy board ke nirnay ko chunauti di thi, jisane dawa kaa patent karaane se sambandhit yachika khaarij kar di thi
 This medicine is used in the treatment of blood cancer and other types of cancer
 chennai sthiti bauddhik sampada apiliy board ne varsh 2006 main novartis kii yachika khaarij kii thi
 Many international pharmaceutical companies were eyeing the Supreme Court's decision on Novartis' petition challenging it
 company glivek ke patent ke liye lambey samay se prayaas kar rahi he
 Read: Cancer is an open invitation to Paan
 If the company succeeded in this, Indian companies would be barred from manufacturing generic medicines
 hamamen se zyaadaatar log shaam ke vakt samosa khaanaa pasand karte hai
 In the rainy season, people order samosa, saying that it has rained today and samosa is the eating season
 par aapako ye jaanakar dukh hoga ki jis samose ko aap itane chaav or bahaane bana-banaakar khate hai wo aapke liye kitna khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 Actually, the top layer of samosa is made of fine flour
 aapane apane ghar main bado ko ye kehete suna hoga ki maida zyada kanjum karne se pet bighad jaataa he
 But don't you want to know what is the reason for him saying this? It is very important to know how the flour is made before knowing the damage caused by all purpose flour
 How all purpose flour is made: All purpose flour is also made from wheat
 jis prakaar aate ke liye gehun ko acchhee tarah se saaf karnaa padataa he usee tarah maide ke liye bhi sabase pehle gehun ko acchhee tarah se dho liya jaataa he
 After this, the top layer of wheat is removed
 iske baad gehun ke safed bhaag ko acchhee tarah, khub maheen pis liya jaataa he
 Only smooth and fine powder obtained after grinding is fine flour
 maide se bani chijen khaane kaa nuksaan:maida gehun se banataa he
 While wheat is considered good for health, flour is dangerous
 isaki sabase badi vajah ye he ki maida banaate samay gehun ke upree chhilake ko hataa diya jaataa he
 Which removes its fiber
 aise main usamen kisi prakaar kaditry fibre nahin rah jatisaliye jab koi maide se bani saamagree kaa seven karata he to ye puri tarah se pach nahin paata he
 Due to lack of proper digestion, some part of it gets stuck in the intestines and can cause many diseases
 iske seven se aksar kabj kii samasya ho jaati he
 Also, refined flour also absorbs a lot of oil
 adhik maatra main tel ke seven se baaripan bana rahata he
 In such a situation, it should be tried to consume things made of fine flour at least
 dilli main badhate pradooshan ko rokane ke liye kejariwal sarkaar kii ore se ek janvari ko lagu kiya ja rahaa od-ivan car formule par dilli hoicourt ne roak lagane se inkaar kar diya he

 maamle kii sunwaayee ab 6 janvari ko kii jaaegi
 The court gave this decision while hearing a petition
 kejariwal ne piem modi se maangi madadisase pehle mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal,pradhanmantri narendra modiko patr likhakar od-ivan formula lagu karne main sahyog karne kii apil kar chuke hai
 Through the letter, he had asked the PM to motivate ministers and mps for this
 kejariwal ne likhaa tha- 'jaisaa ki aapako pataa he dilli main vaayu pradooshan ne ek vikaraal samasya kaa rup liya he
 We are all responsible for this and together we can solve it
 ' mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke saamne pregentation die jane ke baad is par amal laane ke liegidelinetay kii gai he
 Delhi's Transport Minister Gopal Rai made a formal announcement to implement it
 dilli main 1 janvari se lagu hoga od-ivan formuladilli waalon ko 1 janvari seod-evan niyamatodane par do hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana bharna pad saktaa he
 The Transport Department of the Kejriwal government has proposed a fine of Rs 2,000 for breaking this rule during the 15-day trial of odd-even

 The odd-even formula will be applicable in Delhi from January 1, which will be applicable from 8 am to 8 pm, except Sundays, the rest of the day
 ye he formula-- ek janvari se lagu kiya jayega od-ivan car formula- 1 se 15 janvari tak formule kaa trial chalegaa- subah 8 baje se shaam 8 baje tak lagu rahegaa formula- taarikh ke hisaab se hi gaadiyaan chalengi- 1, 3, 5 taarikh ko od number kii gaadiyaan- 2, 4, 6, 8 ko ivan number kii gaadiyaan chalengi-25 disambar se pehle blueprint taiyaar kar liya jayega-satendra jain is yojana ke liye nodel adhikari honge

 desh ke ritred ardhsainik bal or unase jude sanghathan pension kii maang ko lekar aagaamee 3 march ko dilli kii ore kooch kar rahe hai
 They demand that the old pension scheme be scrapped and the old scheme implemented
 vaise to ardhsainik bal lambey samay se iske liye sangharsh kar rahe hai lekin beete kuch maheenon main unki maang main teji ai he
 Apart from this, other government employees including paramilitary forces are getting support from the opposition for this demand
 is sambandh main beete dinon congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra ne uttar pradesh main karmchaaree sanghathanon ke pratinidhimandal se mulaakaat bhi kii
 During this, he assured to include the issue of restoration of old pension system in the party's manifesto for the next Lok Sabha election
 yahi nahin, priyanka ne turant is bare main ek patr congress kii ghoshnaptr samiti ke paas bhi bhijwa diya
 But the question is whether the Congress can fulfill this demand
 sawaal he ki agar ye maang puri bhi hoti he to sarkari khajaane ko kitna boj padegaa
 It is not easy to believe the old pension plan
 According to the public, the restoration of old pension is not easy now because the government is bound to bear a heavy burden on it
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar ne beete kuch saalon main enpies main sudhaar kar rahi he or kai aisi baaten jodi hai jo puraani skim main nahin thim
 Last year, Union Minister of State for Finance Shiv Pratap Shukla told the Lok Sabha in a written reply that pension liabilities are increasing and they have become unsustainable
 saal 2017-18 ke dauraan pension dene par kul 1,56,641
 29 crores has been spent
 is dauraan unhone ye bhi bataaya ki centre sarkaar ne nai pension yojana main apni hissedari 10 fisadi se badhaakar 14 fisadi kar di he
 Due to this, the central fund will incur an additional burden of Rs 2,840 crore in 2019-20
 iskaa matlab ye hua ki aane vaali sarkaron ke liye bhi puraani pension yojana lagu karnaa aasaan nahin hoga

 a committee of parliament has urged the government to form a committee to look into the issues related to accountability of the central bank as a regulator
 iske saath hi samiti ne rigerv bank se bainkon ke liye puunji paryaaptta niyamon (capital adequacy norms) main dheel dene or twarit sudharatmak karrwai (prompt corrective action) kii samiksha karne ko kaha he
 The Parliament's Standing Committee on Finance has also asked the RBI to assess how effective its guidelines have been to deal with fraud

 In addition, proper management of manpower and human resources in state-owned banks has also been advised
 samiti kii report guuruuvaar ko sansad ke patal par rakhi gai
 Questioning the rbi's decision to keep capital adequacy norms above the limit specified under Basil iii's global framework, the committee said the central bank has limited its lending capacity and the government is in the public sector banks
 Has increased the burden of capital infusion
 samiti ne kaha ki use suchit kiya gaya he ki besil (basel) ke niyam antarrashtriya str par sakriy bainkon par lagu hote hai or saarvajanik kshetra ke 9 bank antarrashtriya str par sakriy nahin hai
 Apart from this, most of the old state-owned banks have also not been active internationally
 march 2018 tak ke aankade ke mutabik 9 bainkon ke paas kareeb 9
 93 lakh crore is risk capital
 isse in bainkon ko kareeb 35,000 karod rupee ke atirikt kosh kii jarurat hogi
 These 9 banks include Central Bank of India, Andhra Bank, OBC, Corporation Bank, Vijaya Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, United Bank of India, Dena Bank and Punjab & Sind Bank
 samiti ne apni report main kaha, 'hamaare bainkon ke liye arabiai dwaara nirdhaarit aise kade niyam avastavik or anuchit hai
 The parliamentary committee said that additional capital requirement has been kept for these 9 banks
 yadi isse unhen nijaat milti he, to in bainkon se 5
 a huge amount of Rs 34 lakh crore can be released in the market
 aisa karne se in bainkon kii karj raashi main 51 pratishat tak vruddhi ho sakati he
 These banks can get additional interest of up to Rs 50,000 crore by going into this debt market
 in bainkon ko rigerv bank ne twarit sudharatmak karrwai ke tahat rakhaa hua he
 Due to this many types of loan restrictions have been imposed on these banks
 rigerv bankke pisie (prompt corrective action) ke nae niyam 2017 main lagu kiye gaye the
 Under this, banks are monitored on three parameters, under which the capital adequacy of banks, net non-performing amount (NPA) and return on security etc
 are looked into
 samiti ko ashanka he ki rigerv bank ke in pisie niyamon ke tahat zyada se zyada saarvajanik kshetra ke bank aa jaaenge

 Yes, there is a blog when you have to do 'mann Ki Baat'
 ham aapse adwani kaa wo post share kar rahe hai jo kabhi publish na ho sakaa
 "it's the 1980s
 taarikh 6 april hi thi - yani aaj hi kaa din
 i and Atal ji had a dream
 vakt ke saath ham aage bade
 Even after four years of traveling on the road, we could walk only two steps in Parliament
 phir hamaare sapane main or bhi log shaamil hote gaye
 The scope of our dreams grew
 kareeb 22 saal beete honge
 To make the dream a reality, we kept going step by step
 atal ji rajdharm ko lekar hameshaa hi sakht rahe
 i used to have full agreement with Atal ji's view of Raj Dharma
 bas, main uske vyaavhaarik paksh kaa pakshdhar rahaa
 We kept seeing dreams coming true through the path of Raj Dharma
 magar kuch log rajdharm ke raste apane sapane puure karne main jute jaaenge - aisa maine sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha
 Everyone has the right to dream
 aapane ek sapana dekha
 Fulfilled his dream thik baat he
 It is the right of a person to dream for himself, one will rarely object to it
 agar aap samaaj ke liye sapane dekhte hai to yah aapkaa kartavya he
 If you dream for the country, then it is your responsibility
 kisi or ko sapane dekhne ke liye prerit karnaa bhi aapkaa kartavya he
 It is a big responsibility to inspire ordinary people to dream
 ab agar aap dusron ko sapane dikhaate hai to ye acchhee baat he
 It is even better if you help in fulfilling the dream as well as fulfill it
 agar aap apane sapane puure karne ke liye dusron ko sapane dikhaate hai
 And after fulfilling his dream, show him another dream
 uske baad har baar aap apane sapane kii manzil aage karte jate hai - or dusron ko nae sapane dikhaate rahete hai
 You never ask what happened to those whom you showed dreams
 aapako is baat kaa bhi ilm na ho ki aapane kisko kitne sapane dikhaae?aage chalakar aap yah kah den ki sapanom jaisi to koi baat hi nahin thi - ve to chunavi jumale the
 It is good to show dreams sapane dikhaa kar apana ullu sidhaa karnaa buree baat he
 Then what is the difference between the chit-fund companies and you? They too sell only dreams
 agar log ise nahin to amaanat main khyanat phir kise kahenge?kisi ko maut kaa saudagar kahana buree baat he
 But it can be someone's personal opinion about someone
 koi bhi sauda bura nahin hota, bura to saude ke peeche kaa makasad hota he
 Now, if someone starts doing the business of dreams, what should he say? If there is no clear intention behind the deal then there is no difference between the dream merchant and the merchant of death
 phir koi nijee raay kab aam raay ban jaae is baat kii bhanak tak nahin lagati
 Dreaming is never dangerous sapane dikhaanaa bhi utana khatarnaak nahin hota
 When it comes to dreams, the loop automatically participates in it
 'sabase khatarnaak hota he, sapanom kaa mar janaa'
 And when all limits are exceeded - it is even more dangerous to strangle the dreams of others for their own dreams
 dhyaan rahe, ye koi chunavi jumala nahin he

 Hours after France's claim that the United Nations had cleared the forbidden territory in Libya and military action against the US and its allies within 'a few hours', the Libyan president bowed to global pressures With the declaration of a ceasefire, all kinds of military operations were stopped against the rebels

 is ghatnakram ke baad rajya main mukhya vipakshi dal neshnal conference ke netaa or rajya ke purv siem umr abdulla ne rajyapal enen vohara se mulaakaat kii
 After this meeting, Omar said that he was not going to form the government by supporting the PDP
 unhone kaha ki unki party ko sarkaar chalaane kaa janadesh nahin mila he
 However, Omar's statement is different from his previous stand
 2014 main rajya vidhansabha chunaavon ke nattejey saamne aane ke baad umr abdulla ne bijepi or pidipi donon ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kii koshish kii thi
 However, nobody spoke to him
 aaie jaanate hai ki umr abdulla ke ab pidipi ke saath milakar sarkaar na banane kii kya vajahen ho sakati hai
 1- Why should the PDP-BJP wear the crown of contests? The BJP broke the alliance with the PDP because the state remained turbulent for most of the time under the government
 burhan vaani ke encounter ke baad se rajya main halaat or kharaab ho gaye hai
 In such a situation, it would be foolish to wear the crown of thorns made by Omar Abdullah of BJP and PDP
 sarkaar main aane par unhen pichhali sarkaar ke kaamon kii aalochana bhi jhelni padati
 2- The danger of losing one's land is active in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir
 yahaan pidipi uski pramukh pratidwandvi party he
 Omar Abdullah was the previous CM of the state
 aise main unka pidipi se haath milaanaa apane pratidwandvi ke saamne sarender karne se kam nahin hota
 One such alliance was seen in Uttar Pradesh, where SP and BSP have joined hands against BJP
 aise gathbandhan main ek party ko apni jameen ganvaane ke liye taiyaar hona padegaa
 Omar does not want to do this in Jammu
 3-jise kosousake saath kaise jaaenumar abdulla sarkaar banane ke baad se hi aae din bijepi or pidipi sarkaar ke khai faislon par sawaal uthaate rahe hai
 In this, he has also criticized the growing terrorist incidents on the Pakistani border, the decisions of the central government, several army encounters and decisions like Major Gogoi's human shield to Kashmiri youth
 aise main ve jis sarkaar kii aalochana karte rahe hai, unka pidipi ke saath janaa unki raajnneeti ke liye sahi nahin hota
 Workers of both the parties at the ground level in the state are also unable to prepare for this
 4- UPA / mahagathbandhan mempani jagah kyon ganvaaennational conference upie kii partner rahi he
 The Congress also supported the National Conference in the state assembly elections in 2008
 iske baad hi umr abdulla rajya ke sabase yuva siem bane the
 Presently, the National Conference is also part of the grand alliance for the Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 umr abdulla kuch samay pehle dilli main sonia gandhi kii dinar party main shaamil hue the
 The PDP broke its ties with the UPA in 2008
 aise main loksabhaa chunaavon se thik pehle umr abdulla pidipi ke saath jaakar mahagathbandhan se baahar nahin hona chaahate
 5- Why come to the power for half time? The term of the assembly in Jammu and Kashmir is for 6 years

 The High Court has categorically refused to direct the installation of color photographs
 hoicourt ne maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue kaha ki vartmaan haalat main aisa nirdesh dena mumkin nahin he, kyonki ab chunaav hone me ek maheene se bhi kam kaa vaqt bachaa he
 At present, the court has accepted to hear the petition filed in this matter
 maamle kii agali sunwaayee 8 may ko hogi
 During the hearing, the Chief Justice refused to accept the oral plea of the petitioner to be instructed to put color photographs in the municipal corporation elections as well
 hoicourt ne kaha ki chunaav prakriya shuru ho chuki he or yadi aisa aadesh diya gaya to chunaavon main deree hogi
 The Election Commission and the Delhi State Election Commission expressed their objection to the plea, saying that it is not mandatory to give any guidelines regarding the installation of color photographs in evms
 dilli ke sabhi 272 nigam vaardon main 23 april chunaav hona tay he
 Two students Anil Kumar and Pratap Chandra have filed this petition in the Delhi High Court

 He said that instruction should be given to place color photographs in evms, because black and white photos do not identify them
 color photo se bhram bhi dur hoga or logon aasaani se apane pasandida pratyaashee ko chun sakenge

 LJP supremo Ram Vilas Paswan today accused the Nitish government of Bihar of failing on all fronts and said that this government has worked to spoil the rural social environment by opening liquor shops from village to village instead of factory
 gaya ke belaganj vidhansabha kshetra main rajd-lojpa pratyaashee ke paksh main aaj ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue paswan ne bihar kii nitish sarkaar par har morche par vifal rahane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki is sarkaar ne pradesh main kal-kaarkaane ke bajaae gaanv-gaanv sharaab kii dukaane khulwakar gramin saamaajik parivesh ko bigaadane kaa kaam kiya
 Accusing Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of cheating the people of the state during his five-year rule, Paswan said that after this assembly election, Nitish will not even know about it
 paswan ne kaha ki bihar main satta main aane par nitish ne vikaas kaa naaraa diya tha par unhone pradesh main ek sui kaa kaarkaana bhi nahin kholaa
 He challenged that if he is wrong, he will retire from politics
 paswan ne kaha ki pehle shaharon main sharaab kii dukaane hotin thi par vartmaan pradesh sarkaar ne ab har panchayat main sharaab kii chaar dukaane khulavaa di hai
 Paswan accused Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of making the people of the state an alcoholic during his last five years and said that if he gets an opportunity to govern more in the next five years, Nitish will make everyone a gambler
 paswan ne kaha ki kisi pradesh ke vikaas kaa paimaana us rajya main bijli kaa utpaadan or uski uplabdhta he par jharkhand sahit kai anya pradeshon main jahaan logon ko ab 24 ghanton bijli uplabdh hoti he, vahiin bihar main logon ko paanch ghante bhi bijli nahin mil paati he
 He said that due to lack of electricity, factories are not able to open tomorrow, due to which jobs are not available and the youth have to migrate to other states in search of livelihood
 paswan ne kaha ki centre main mantri pad par rahete unhone apane prayaason se bihar ke bodhgaya, betia or hajipur main teen steel kaarkaane sthapit kiye par bodhgaya kaa kaarkaana bijli ke abhaav main thap he

 In Haryana, the public has given a mandate against the ruling BJP and has rejected the bjp's slogan of 'abki Baar 75 Par', while in Maharashtra also the decrease of seats of BJP and their allies and increase confidence in Congress is a positive sign for us

 Ashok Gehlot said that our leader Rahul Gandhi ji constantly says that the Prime Minister takes people's attention away from the ground issues
 jo aamajan ke mudde hai uske bare main ek shabd nahin bolte
 He said that the Goods and Services Tax and Demonetisation have broken the back of small and medium entrepreneurs, farmers, laborers and poor people, unemployment problem continues to prevail in the country

 The judges said that they believe that no single system in the public distribution system can be a 'good' system and in accordance with the recommendations of the Wadhwa Committee, it should be set up at the state level by corporations, panchayati raj institutions, cooperatives and self-help groups of registered women
 It should be left to the state governments to find an alternative to their operations

 Busy in promoting his Sachin: a Billion Dreams, Sachin Tendulkar is revealing many things about his career
 master-blaster sachin tendulkar kaa maananaa he ki chote formet ke cricket ne lagbhag sabakuch badal diya he
 According to him, the arrival of T20 cricket has changed the attitude of batsmen in terms of chasing big scores in odis and it would have helped India if it had happened during the 2003 World Cup
 vastav main dakshin africa dharti par khele gaye 2003 ke world cap main bhartiya team ne jabardast khel dikhaaya tha

 johanisburg main khele gaye is khitaabi match main australian ballebaajon ne bhartiya gendbaajon kii aisi dhunaai kii thi, jaisi ki aaj ke daur main aap tii-20 main dekhte hai
 Australia had scored 359 for two while batting first, in response to which the Indian team was dismissed for 234 runs
 team india ne lakshya kaa peechha karte samay lagbhag pehle hi haar maan lee thi or ant main 125 ran se haar gai thi
 The team felt that this goal was impossible, while in 20 overs in T20, the teams reached the target of more than 200
 
 
 sachin tendulkar ne puraane din yaad karte hue kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki yadi ham vah match aaj khelte to khilaadi alag tareeke se khelte
 Comments master-blaster ke kehane aashay yahi thi ki tii-20 ke aane se ballebaajon ne teji se score karne ke tareeke dhund liye hai or khud ko uske anuroop dhaal liya he
 He is sorry that his team's batsmen did not play at that time
 unhone kaha, ‘ham us match main utsaah se bhare the or pehle hi over se kaaphi utsahit the
 If those same players had a chance today, the attitude towards the game would have been different
 ’ When the first score was over 300, the teams considered the goal impossible and the experts also seemed to give the defeat almost certain
 unhone kaha, ‘tii-20 cricket us samay hota to khilaadiyon kaa ravaiya alag hota kyonki un dinon 359 ran bananaa mushkil lagata tha
 It seems easier today

 ’ In fact, in the 2003 World Cup played on South African soil, the Indian team showed a great game
 vah final main pahunchi thi
 In this title match played in Johannesburg, Australian batsmen beat Indian bowlers like you see in T20 today
 australia ne pehle batting karte hue do wicket par 359 ran banaae the, jiske jawaab main bhartiya team 234 ran par out ho gai thi
 Team India almost conceded defeat while chasing the target and eventually lost by 125 runs
 team ko laga tha ki yah lakshya asambhav he, jabaki tii-20 main 20 over main main hi timen 200 se adhik ke lakshya ko hasil kar leti hai
 
 
 Recalling the old days, Sachin Tendulkar said, 'I think if we played that match today, the players would have played differently
 ’tippaniyan The intention of the master-blaster was that with the arrival of T20, batsmen have found ways to score fast and have adapted themselves accordingly

 chardhaam yatra ke itihaas main yah pehla mauka he jab kedarnath dham main badrinaath kii apeksha adhik shraddhalu pahunch rahe hai
 This time the doors of Kedarnath Dham were opened on 29 April and the doors of Badrinath Dham were opened on 30 April
 badrinaath pahunchane vaale yatriyon kii sankhya hameshaa kedarnath se pahunchane waalon se zyada rahati thi
 But this time there are different trends
 jahaan kedarnath main kareeb 12 hajaar yatri rojaanaa pahunch rahe hai, vahiin badrinaath pahunchane vaale yatriyon kii sankhya 11 hajaar se 12 hajaar ke bich he
 Alam is that it has not been even a month since Kedar's doors opened and during this time the number of pilgrims coming to Kedarnath has crossed three and a half lakhs
 badhate tirthayatriyon kii sankhya se jahaan kedarghati ke logon ke chehre khile hue hai, vahiin badrinaath-kedarnath mandir samiti kii aay main bhi ijapha ho rahaa he
 According to local people, the reason for more passengers coming to Kedarnath is the desire to see the reconstruction work done in Kedarnath after the 2013 disaster
 yahaan ke liye chal rahi helicopter seva ne bhi yatriyon kii sankhya main ijapha kiya he
 Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat also seems happy with the increasing number of pilgrims
 unhone kaha, ''deshbhar main uttarakhand ke surakshit hone kaa sandesh jane se yatriyon ke aagaman main ijapha hua he
 He has also instructed the officers on duty in Kedarnath to regularly get information about the stay and food arrangements of the devotees
 unhone samay-samay par dukaanon main rate list bhi jaanchane ko kaha he
 The disaster in June 2013 caused great destruction in Kedarpuri as well as Kedarghati
 isse do saal tak yatra lagbhag thap rahi
 But, in 2016 and 2017, the number of passengers had increased slightly and this year the journey has returned to full track
 june 2013 kii aapadaa ke baad kedarnath yatra kaa trend bhi badal gaya he
 Whereas most of the passengers used to give importance to hiking, now a large number of passengers are either reaching Kedarnath by horse or mule, or by helicopter
 kapaat khulne ke baad kedarnath pahunchane vaale 40 fisadi yatriyon ne ghoda-khachchar yaa helicopter kaa sahaara liya he
 Veteran Tirtha Purohit Srinivas Posti says, "in olden times, travelers used to come on foot from Rishikesh for the Chardham Yatra, but over time the methods of travel changed
 '' varsh 2003 main kedarnath ke liye hawaii seva shuru hui thi, tab ginati ke yatri hi iskaa upyog karte the
 Since 2013, its use has increased drastically
 ab to har teesraa yatri helicopter se kedarnath pahunchnaa chahta he
 Total 3 in the year 2016
 09 lakh tirth yatri kedarnath aae
 Of these, 90 thousand passengers arrived by air service
 par is baar yatra ke shuruaati 23 din main 30 hajaar yatri helicopter se kedarnath pahunch chuke hai
 The number of travelers who reach Darshan by horse-mule is also around 80 thousand
 haalanki badali paristhitiyon ne bhi isamen yogadan diya he
 The distance of Kedarnath has increased from two km to 16 km from the new footpath that came into existence after the disaster
 vahiin, khadi chadhaai ke saath hi oonchai par oxigen kii kami ke kaaran paidal chalane main mushkilen bhi badi hai
 This has led to the life of old pilgrims
 is baar yatra shuru hone ke baad ab tak prati din ausatan ek tirthayatri kii jaan jane se sarkaar bhi chintit dikh rahi he
 Chief Secretary Utpal Kumar Singh has reviewed the health arrangements in Kedarnath Yatra through video conferencing and has given necessary instructions
 rudraprayag ke jiladhikari mangesh ghildial bataate hai, ''yatra maarg main rudraprayag se gholtir ke bich main 23 medical relif post sthapit kiye gaye hai
 40 oxygen cylinders and 15 oxygen generators have been arranged

 9 dollars per barrel
 uske mukaable main 10 agast 2009 ko upie kii sarkaar main petrol 44 rupee 63 paise litre tha
 In the Modi government, on 10 September 2018, 80 rupees has been 73 paise per liter
 daam badha ki gata
 Janta Congress is watching bjp's Is Only Two Game
 bijepi ke graphics main daam ghate hai jabaki aapaki jeb ke hisaab se bade hai
 Did earnings grow? aanindyon chakravarti ne apane simpal samachar main bataaya he ki jidipi ke 8
 Even after being 2 percent, the real income of the people has fallen significantly
 aanidyon kaa simple samachar aap enditivi kii website par dekh sakate hai
 He says that the real income of farmers is not worth seeing or showing after adjusting the inflation from income
 april-june 2017 se april-june 2018 ke bich prati kisaan aamadani 100 rupee se badhkar 101
 60 paise has been increased
 yani 1 rupee 60 paise
 If this pace is there then it will take 44 years to become 100 to 200
 kisaanon kii aamadani tab jaakar doguni hogi
 The comments acchhee baat he ki tab tak bhaajapa kii hi sarkaar rahegi kyonki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha he ki bhaajapa kii 50 saal tak yani 2069 tak sarkaar rahegi
 It may be that the BJP continues to get immense support from the public even after petrol diesel becomes expensive and jobs are not available, but because of this the public does not have any problem
 aaj hi hindustan times ke rahul singh kii khabar he ki bhartiya sena agle 4-5 saalon main dedh lakh naukariyaan kam karne ja rahi he

 gaanv dehaat main sena main bhartee ke liye din raat daudane vaale yuvakon tak yah soochna samay se pahunch jaani chahie
 Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan have reduced taxes but there is no significant impact on prices
 rajasthan main 2 rupee 21 paisa tex gata he phir bhi petrol 81 rupee 21 paise he
 The diesel is 75 rupees 12 paise a liter
 2012 main bharat band ke dauraan vipaksh main rahete hue arun jetali ne ek sateek bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 That is, if governments do not correct the tax, then such demonstrations will continue
 petrol or deazal kii raajnneeti main janata sukhi he
 Now he has no one left to blame
 ab to vah 50 saal tak kisi ko dosha hi nahin de sakegi kyonki amit shah ne kaha he ki bhaajapa apane kaam ke dam par 50 saal tak satta main rahegi
 Is that work also included reducing the price of petrol and diesel? yah prashn he yaa yah prashn hi nahin he
 The reason is that the economy of many countries is staggering
 isliye niveshak apana paisa nikaalkar dollar kharid rahe hai
 Because of this the dollar is becoming expensive because everybody is buying
 bharat kii tel companiyaan bhi kachche tel ke daam badhane kii ashanka main dollar kharid rahi hai
 PTI quoted the news that the current dollar will be used to buy oil
 antarrashtriya paristhitiyon kii baat kii ja rahi he

 bajet ghate ko sanbhaalane ke liye byaaz dar 60 pratishat ho gaya he
 India's rupee will also be in the grip of all these reasons, but the politics before 2014 rejected those reasons
 Now when the question is being asked, it is being said that international conditions are responsible
 agar rupaya 80 tak chalaa gaya to aayaat karne waalon kii kya haalat hogi, petrol deazal ke daam kahaan tak jaaenge, videshon main padhane vaale chaatro par kitna aarthik boj badhegaa, yah sab sawaal saamne hai
 The Bharat Bandh was against the increase in the price of petrol diesel, but both of them have also opposed the Bharat Bandh and raised their prices by remembering the babas who were once selling petrol for Rs

 The Mumbai people are buying 88 rupees 12 paise a liter of petrol

 On 10 September, the opposition India was closed
 subah ke akhbaaron main pradhanmantri kaa bayaan chapa tha ki congress sarkaar main bhi fail thi, vipaksh main bhi fail he
 The Congress was closed that the Modi government had failed, but when their leaders raised the newspaper in their hands, they must have read that they failed
 fail banaam fail kii is raajnneeti main aap apni gaadi kii tank par nazar rakhie
 The Bharat Bandh of Congress has been supported by more than 20 opposition parties
 rahul gandhi alag-alag dal ke netaaon ke saath rajghat gaye
 Bapu brought the water he had brought from Mansarovar to the tomb and then marched with the opposition parties to the Ramlila Maidan from Rajghat

 This March, NCP, ZS, RJD, RLD, SP, BSP, TMC and Aam Aadmi Party leaders took part and appeared on the stage of Ramlila Maidan
 shivasena or maharashtra navnirmaan sena ne bhi is band main hissaa liya he
 Amit Shah has said in bjp's national executive that after coming in 2019, no one will be able to beat BJP for next 50 years
 unhone yah bhi saaf kiya ki ve yah baat ahankaar main nahin kar rahe balki apane kaam kii vajah se bhaajapa ko koi nahin haraa paaegaa
 In this sense, till 2069, BJP will remain the government
 amit shah kii is vinamr bhavishyavaanee ke aage bharat band kii kahani feeki ho gai he
 However, you should note that the Congress workers in Allahabad are forcing two donkeys to pull the car
 petrol ke daam badhane main in gadhon kaa kya kasoor tha
 The donkeys have told me in an exclusive conversation that they do not know that petrol has become expensive because even when cheaper, humans do not reduce the burden on their back

 muretha baandh kar rickshaw chalaa rahe the
 He was greeting with folded hands
 rickshaw ke peeche thele par skuti chali aa rahi thi or skuti ke peeche gas kaa silendar chalaa aa rahaa tha
 We showed in the Friday flashback how the BJP had come out with a variety of ideas during the Bharat Bandh so that those pictures could be found in the news channels and newspapers and the news of the opposition's shutdown could come prominently on the front page
 aap 11 sitambar kaa akhbaar dekh lijiega
 In many parts of the country, activists of the opposition marched with the flag banners
 kahin bazaar band rahe to kahin haive par jam ho gaya
 We have shown all this to be kept in the archive of our library
 jis tarah se aaj log 2014 ke pehle ke arun jetali, sushamaa swaraj, ravishankar prasad, shahanwaaz hossain ke bayanon kaa link viral kar rahe hai, usee tarah 2069 ke baad mere prime time kaa link share karenge kyonki amit shah ne kaha he ki 2019 main jeetne ke baad bhaajapa ko 50 saal tak koi nahin haraa sakegaa
 BJP leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad termed the bandh as a democratic right and said who is responsible for the violence that has taken place
 unhone kaha ki congress or vipaksh ke log gusse main khoff paidaa kar rahe hai
 Criticizing all these things, Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the increase in the price of petrol diesel is out of our hands
 to aapane suna
 The increase of diesel and petrol is out of our hands
 kya yahi antarrashtriya kaaran bijepi ke bharat band ke samay nahin rahe honge
 Then why did the opposition stop India
 tab kyon ravishankar prasad ne band main hissaa lete hue cycle chalaai thi
 In one video, Ravi Shankar Prasad is seen cycling against the price of petrol diesel
 us samay bhi to antarrashtriya kaaran the
 The price of crude oil went up to USD 109 per barrel
 tab arun jetali ne kaha tha ki 90 dollar prati bairal hone par petrol 50 rupee litre hona chahie
 At the moment it is $ 78 per barrel, why don't Jaitley g 50 rupees a liter of petrol
 23 may 2012 ko hamaare sahyogi channel se baat karte hue ravishankar prasad kis jaankaree ke aadhaar par antarrashtriya kaarnon ke tark ko riject kar rahe the
 Then our colleague Anchor had asked Prasad what he would have done if he was in power and he had said that when we come to power, we will manage the economy in such a way that it can tolerate such a setback
 ab sawaal unheen se he ki aapane kya manage kiya he ki jhatka bardaasht nahin ho paa rahaa he or petrol 89 rupaya litre ho gaya
 This did not happen even during the UPA
 is jawaab main ravishankar prasad yah bhi kah rahe hai ki ve kachche tel ke daam badhane kii baat samajhate hai lekin jab kachche tel kii keemat kam hoti he tab bhi sarkaar petrol deazal ke daam kam nahin karti he
 After the arrival of the Modi government in 2014, the price of crude oil in the international market had fallen to around $ 41 per barrel by 2016
 kya us anupaat main daam kam hue the jis anupaat main kachche tel kii keemat ghati thi
 In 2012, the average price of crude oil reached $ 109 per barrel
 tab dilli main may 2012 main petrol 73
 18 liters was reached
 2017 main jab kachche tel kii ausat keemat 52
 $ 51 per barrel
 tab dilli main 3 sibantar 2017 ko 69 rupee 55 paise prati litre tha
 You can see that petrol got 69 rupees liter even when the price of crude oil was around $ 51 per barrel at the time of NDAK and you gave about 69 rupees per liter when UPA was $ 107 per barrel in 2012
 yah khel he
 Today, there was a war between the Congress and the BJP through graphics on Twitter
 bijepi ne apane graphics main kachche tel kii keemton kaa anupaat nahin bataaya he
 Petrol 33 on 16 May 2004 as per the bjp's graphics chart
 71 paise litre tha jo 16 may 2009 ko 40 rupee 62 paise hua
 That is, it increased by 20 percent in five years
 phir 16 may 2014 ko 71 rupee 41 paise prati litre hua yani 75
 Rose 8 percent
 ab 10 sitambar 2018 ko 80 rupee 73 paise prati litre hua he jo 13 pratishat gata he

 There are many countries whose economy is collapsing, one of them is Turkey where the strong leader's passion was overshadowed

 If the rupee goes up to 80, what will be the condition of importers, where will the price of petrol diesel go, how much economic burden will increase on students studying abroad, all the questions are in front

 congress kaa band tha ki modi sarkaar fail he lekin unke netaaon ne jab akhbaar haath main uthaaya hoga to yahi padhaa hoga ki vahi fail hai
 In this politics of failure versus failure, keep an eye on your vehicle tank
 congress ke bharat band ko 20 se zyada vipakshi dalon kaa saath mila he
 Rahul Gandhi went to Rajghat with different party leaders

 Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena have also participated in this bandh
 amit shah ne bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main kaha he ki 2019 main aane ke baad agle 50 saal tak bhaajapa ko koi nahin haraa sakegaa
 He also made it clear that he is not doing this in ego, but because of his work no one will be able to defeat BJP
 is lihaaz se 2069 tak bhaajapa kii hi sarkaar rahegi
 The story of Bharat Bandh has faded ahead of this humble prediction of Amit Shah
 phir bhi aap note karen ki elahabaad main congressi kaaryakarta do gadhon ko majaboor kar rahe hai ki wo car khinchen
 What was the fault of these donkeys in increasing the price of petrol? gadhon ne mujhe exclusive baatcheet main kaha he ki unhen nahin pataa ki petrol mahangaa ho gaya he kyonki jab sasta hota he tab bhi insaan unki peeth par boj kam nahin karata he

 You will see the newspaper of September 11
 desh ke kai hisson main vipaksh ke kaaryakartao ne jhande binakar ke saath march kiya
 Somewhere the market is closed and somewhere the highway gets jammed
 hamane yah sab apni librari ke archive main rakhane ke liye dikhaaya he
 Just as today people are viraling the link of statements of Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Shahnawaz Hussain before 2014, in the same way after 2069, i will share the link of prime time as Amit Shah has said that in 2019 After winning, nobody will be able to defeat BJP for 50 years
 bijepi netaa or kendiy mantri ravishankar prasad ne band ko loktantric adhikaar bataate hue kaha ki jo hinsa hui he uske liye koun zimmedaar he
 He said that the people of Congress and Opposition are creating fear in anger
 in sab baton kii aalochana karte hue ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki petrol deazal kaa daam badhanaa hamaare haath ke baahar he
 So you heard
 dijal or petrol kaa badhanaa hamaare haath ke baahar he
 Would this not have been the international cause during the Bharat Bandh of BJP? phir tab vipaksh ne bharat band kyon kiya
 Then why did Ravi Shankar Prasad ride a bicycle taking part in the bandh
 ek video main ravishankar prasad cycle chalaate hue petrol deazal ke daam kaa virodh karte dikhte hai
 Even at that time there were international reasons
 kachche tel kaa daam 109 dollars prati bairal tak ho gaya tha
 Then Arun Jaitley had said that petrol should be 50 rupees a liter at $ 90 per barrel
 is vakt 78 dollar prati bairal he, jetali ji 50 rupee litre petrol kyon nahin kar dete hai
 Talking to our affiliate channel on 23 May 2012, Ravi Shankar Prasad was rejecting the logic of international causes based on what information
 tab hamaari sahyogi ankar ne prasad se poocha tha ki aap satta main hote to kya karte to unhone kaha tha ham jab satta main aaengo to arthvyavastha ko is tarah se manage karenge ki aise jatke ko bardaasht kar le
 Now the question is from them that what you have managed is that the shock is unable to be tolerated and petrol has been reduced to 89 rupees a liter
 ye to upie ke samay bhi nahin hua tha
 In this reply, Ravi Shankar Prasad is also saying that he understands the rise in the price of crude oil, but even when the price of crude oil is low, the government does not reduce the price of petrol diesel
 2014 main modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad to international market main kachche tel kii keemat girte girte 2016 tak kareeb 41 dollars prati bairal ho gai thi
 Did the prices come down in the ratio in which the price of crude oil decreased
 2012 main kachche tel kii ausat keemat 109 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch gai
 Then petrol 73 in May 2012 in Delhi
 18 rupee litre pahunch gaya tha
 In 2017, when the average price of crude oil was 52
 51 dollar prati bairal ho gai
 Then in Delhi on 3rd Sibantar 2017 69 was 55 paise per liter
 aap dekh sakenge ki endieke samay kachche tel kii keemat kareeb 51 dollar prati bairal hone par bhi petrol 69 rupee litre mila or upie ke samay 2012 main 107 dollar prati bairal hone par kareeb 69 rupee prati litre aapane diya
 This is a game
 aaj congress or bijepi ke bich twitor par graphics ke zarie bhi jang hui
 The BJP has not stated the ratio of crude oil prices in its graphics
 bijepi ke graphics chart ke anusaar 16 may 2004 ko petrol 33
 71 paisa was liter, which was 40 rupees 62 paise on 16 May 2009
 yani paanch saal main 20 pratishat zyada badha
 Then on May 16, 2014, 71 rupees 41 paise per liter i
e
 75
 8 pratishat bad gaya
 Now on September 10, 2018, 80 rupees 73 paise per liter, which has been reduced by 13 percent
 kya vaaki daam ghate hai
 In response to this, Congress has tweeted
 congress ne kachche tel ke daam ke anusaar bataaya he
 According to this chart, in August 2009 and September 2018, both the time the price of crude oil 71
 9 dollars prati bairal thi
 In comparison, on 10 August 2009, petrol in the UPA government was 44 rupees 63 paise
 modi sarkaar main 10 sitambar 2018 ko 80 rupee 73 paise prati litre ho gaya he
 Price increase that decreased
 janata congress bijepi kaa iz iklaval tu game dekh rahi he
 bjp's graphics have reduced prices while your pocket has increased
 kya kamai badi
 Anandya Chakraborty has told in his simple news that 8 of GDP
 2 pratishat hone ke baad bhi logon kii asli aamadani main kaaphi giravat ai he
 You can see the simple news of the actors on the website of NDTV
 unka kahana he ki aamadani se mudrasphiti ko edjust kar dene par kisaanon kii asli aamadani na dekhne laayak he na dikhaane laayak he
 Between april-june 2017 to april-june 2018, income per farmer increased from Rs 100 to 101
 60 paise badi he
 That is, 1 rupee 60 paise
 yahi raftaar rahi to 100 se 200 hone main 44 saal lagenge
 Farmers' income will double by then
 tippaniyan It is good that till then BJP will remain the government because BJP President Amit Shah has said that BJP will remain in government for 50 years i
e
 till 2069
 ho saktaa he ki petrol deazal mahangaa hone or naukariyaan nahin milane ke baad bhi bhaajapa ko janata kaa apaar samarthan miltaa rahe lekin isaki vajah se janata ko takalif nahin he yah baat bhi sahi nahin
 Today, Rahul Singh of Hindustan Times reports that the Indian Army is going to reduce one and a half lakh jobs in the next 4-5 years
 iske liye june ke maheene main kader kii kshamta kii samiksha karne ke aadesh die gaye hai
 a panel of 11 members has been formed which will also consider reducing the number force
 baaki report aap hindustan times main padhein
 This information should be reached in time to the youths who run day and night to join the army in the village countryside
 andhra pradesh or rajasthan ne tex main kami kii he magar daam par koi khaas asar nahin he
 Rajasthan has reduced tax by 2 rupees 21 paise, yet petrol is 81 rupees 21 paise
 dijal 75 rupee 12 paise litre he
 During the Bharat Bandh in 2012, Arun Jaitley made an accurate prediction while in opposition
 yahi ki agar sarkaron ne tex ko sahi nahin kiya to is tarah ke pradarshan hote rahenge
 The public is happy in the politics of petrol and diesel
 ab uske paas dosha dene ke liye koi nahin bachaa he
 Now she will not be able to blame anyone for 50 years because Amit Shah has said that the BJP will remain in power for 50 years on the strength of its work
 kya us kaam main petrol or deazal ke daam kam karne kaa bhi kaam shaamil he
 It is a question or it is not a question at all
 turki kaa lira ek saal main dollar ke saamne 50 fisadi tut chukaa he

 bajet ghate ko sanbhaalane ke liye byaaz dar 60 pratishat ho gaya he
 India's rupee will also be in the grip of all these reasons, but the politics before 2014 rejected those reasons
 Now when the question is being asked, it is being said that international conditions are responsible
 agar rupaya 80 tak chalaa gaya to aayaat karne waalon kii kya haalat hogi, petrol deazal ke daam kahaan tak jaaenge, videshon main padhane vaale chaatro par kitna aarthik boj badhegaa, yah sab sawaal saamne hai

 BJP leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad termed the bandh as a democratic right and said who is responsible for the violence that has taken place
 unhone kaha ki congress or vipaksh ke log gusse main khoff paidaa kar rahe hai
 Criticizing all these things, Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the increase in the price of petrol diesel is out of our hands

 The increase of diesel and petrol is out of our hands

 The price of crude oil went up to USD 109 per barrel
 tab arun jetali ne kaha tha ki 90 dollar prati bairal hone par petrol 50 rupee litre hona chahie
 At the moment it is $ 78 per barrel, why don't Jaitley g 50 rupees a liter of petrol
 23 may 2012 ko hamaare sahyogi channel se baat karte hue ravishankar prasad kis jaankaree ke aadhaar par antarrashtriya kaarnon ke tark ko riject kar rahe the
 Then our colleague Anchor had asked Prasad what he would have done if he was in power and he had said that when we come to power, we will manage the economy in such a way that it can tolerate such a setback
 ab sawaal unheen se he ki aapane kya manage kiya he ki jhatka bardaasht nahin ho paa rahaa he or petrol 89 rupaya litre ho gaya
 This did not happen even during the UPA
 is jawaab main ravishankar prasad yah bhi kah rahe hai ki ve kachche tel ke daam badhane kii baat samajhate hai lekin jab kachche tel kii keemat kam hoti he tab bhi sarkaar petrol deazal ke daam kam nahin karti he
 After the arrival of the Modi government in 2014, the price of crude oil in the international market had fallen to around $ 41 per barrel by 2016
 kya us anupaat main daam kam hue the jis anupaat main kachche tel kii keemat ghati thi
 In 2012, the average price of crude oil reached $ 109 per barrel
 tab dilli main may 2012 main petrol 73

 2017 main jab kachche tel kii ausat keemat 52

 tab dilli main 3 sibantar 2017 ko 69 rupee 55 paise prati litre tha
 You can see that petrol got 69 rupees liter even when the price of crude oil was around $ 51 per barrel at the time of NDAK and you gave about 69 rupees per liter when UPA was $ 107 per barrel in 2012

 India's rupee will also be in the grip of all these reasons, but the politics before 2014 rejected those reasons
 Now when the question is being asked, it is being said that international conditions are responsible

 is lihaaz se 2069 tak bhaajapa kii hi sarkaar rahegi
 The story of Bharat Bandh has faded ahead of this humble prediction of Amit Shah
 phir bhi aap note karen ki elahabaad main congressi kaaryakarta do gadhon ko majaboor kar rahe hai ki wo car khinchen
 What was the fault of these donkeys in increasing the price of petrol? gadhon ne mujhe exclusive baatcheet main kaha he ki unhen nahin pataa ki petrol mahangaa ho gaya he kyonki jab sasta hota he tab bhi insaan unki peeth par boj kam nahin karata he

 hamane friday flashbek main dikhaaya tha ki kaise bharat band ke vakt bijepi ne tarah tarah kaa idia nikaala tha taaki news channelon or akhabaaron main un tasveeron ko jagah mili or vipaksh ke band kii khabar pehle panne par pramukhataa se aa sake
 You will see the newspaper of September 11
 desh ke kai hisson main vipaksh ke kaaryakartao ne jhande binakar ke saath march kiya
 Somewhere the market is closed and somewhere the highway gets jammed
 hamane yah sab apni librari ke archive main rakhane ke liye dikhaaya he
 Just as today people are viraling the link of statements of Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Shahnawaz Hussain before 2014, in the same way after 2069, i will share the link of prime time as Amit Shah has said that in 2019 After winning, nobody will be able to defeat BJP for 50 years
 bijepi netaa or kendiy mantri ravishankar prasad ne band ko loktantric adhikaar bataate hue kaha ki jo hinsa hui he uske liye koun zimmedaar he
 He said that the people of Congress and Opposition are creating fear in anger
 in sab baton kii aalochana karte hue ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki petrol deazal kaa daam badhanaa hamaare haath ke baahar he
 So you heard
 dijal or petrol kaa badhanaa hamaare haath ke baahar he
 Would this not have been the international cause during the Bharat Bandh of BJP? phir tab vipaksh ne bharat band kyon kiya
 Then why did Ravi Shankar Prasad ride a bicycle taking part in the bandh
 ek video main ravishankar prasad cycle chalaate hue petrol deazal ke daam kaa virodh karte dikhte hai
 Even at that time there were international reasons
 kachche tel kaa daam 109 dollars prati bairal tak ho gaya tha
 Then Arun Jaitley had said that petrol should be 50 rupees a liter at $ 90 per barrel
 is vakt 78 dollar prati bairal he, jetali ji 50 rupee litre petrol kyon nahin kar dete hai
 Talking to our affiliate channel on 23 May 2012, Ravi Shankar Prasad was rejecting the logic of international causes based on what information
 tab hamaari sahyogi ankar ne prasad se poocha tha ki aap satta main hote to kya karte to unhone kaha tha ham jab satta main aaengo to arthvyavastha ko is tarah se manage karenge ki aise jatke ko bardaasht kar le
 Now the question is from them that what you have managed is that the shock is unable to be tolerated and petrol has been reduced to 89 rupees a liter
 ye to upie ke samay bhi nahin hua tha
 In this reply, Ravi Shankar Prasad is also saying that he understands the rise in the price of crude oil, but even when the price of crude oil is low, the government does not reduce the price of petrol diesel
 2014 main modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad to international market main kachche tel kii keemat girte girte 2016 tak kareeb 41 dollars prati bairal ho gai thi
 Did the prices come down in the ratio in which the price of crude oil decreased
 2012 main kachche tel kii ausat keemat 109 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch gai
 Then petrol 73 in May 2012 in Delhi
 18 rupee litre pahunch gaya tha
 In 2017, when the average price of crude oil was 52
 51 dollar prati bairal ho gai
 Then in Delhi on 3rd Sibantar 2017 69 was 55 paise per liter
 aap dekh sakenge ki endieke samay kachche tel kii keemat kareeb 51 dollar prati bairal hone par bhi petrol 69 rupee litre mila or upie ke samay 2012 main 107 dollar prati bairal hone par kareeb 69 rupee prati litre aapane diya
 This is a game
 aaj congress or bijepi ke bich twitor par graphics ke zarie bhi jang hui
 The BJP has not stated the ratio of crude oil prices in its graphics
 bijepi ke graphics chart ke anusaar 16 may 2004 ko petrol 33
 71 paisa was liter, which was 40 rupees 62 paise on 16 May 2009
 yani paanch saal main 20 pratishat zyada badha
 Then on May 16, 2014, 71 rupees 41 paise per liter i
e
 75
 8 pratishat bad gaya
 Now on September 10, 2018, 80 rupees 73 paise per liter, which has been reduced by 13 percent
 kya vaaki daam ghate hai
 In response to this, Congress has tweeted
 congress ne kachche tel ke daam ke anusaar bataaya he
 According to this chart, in August 2009 and September 2018, both the time the price of crude oil 71
 9 dollars prati bairal thi
 In comparison, on 10 August 2009, petrol in the UPA government was 44 rupees 63 paise
 modi sarkaar main 10 sitambar 2018 ko 80 rupee 73 paise prati litre ho gaya he
 Price increase that decreased
 janata congress bijepi kaa iz iklaval tu game dekh rahi he
 bjp's graphics have reduced prices while your pocket has increased
 kya kamai badi
 Anandya Chakraborty has told in his simple news that 8 of GDP
 2 pratishat hone ke baad bhi logon kii asli aamadani main kaaphi giravat ai he
 You can see the simple news of the actors on the website of NDTV
 unka kahana he ki aamadani se mudrasphiti ko edjust kar dene par kisaanon kii asli aamadani na dekhne laayak he na dikhaane laayak he
 Between april-june 2017 to april-june 2018, income per farmer increased from Rs 100 to 101
 60 paise badi he
 That is, 1 rupee 60 paise
 yahi raftaar rahi to 100 se 200 hone main 44 saal lagenge
 Farmers' income will double by then
 tippaniyan It is good that till then BJP will remain the government because BJP President Amit Shah has said that BJP will remain in government for 50 years i
e
 till 2069
 ho saktaa he ki petrol deazal mahangaa hone or naukariyaan nahin milane ke baad bhi bhaajapa ko janata kaa apaar samarthan miltaa rahe lekin isaki vajah se janata ko takalif nahin he yah baat bhi sahi nahin
 Today, Rahul Singh of Hindustan Times reports that the Indian Army is going to reduce one and a half lakh jobs in the next 4-5 years
 iske liye june ke maheene main kader kii kshamta kii samiksha karne ke aadesh die gaye hai
 a panel of 11 members has been formed which will also consider reducing the number force
 baaki report aap hindustan times main padhein
 This information should be reached in time to the youths who run day and night to join the army in the village countryside
 andhra pradesh or rajasthan ne tex main kami kii he magar daam par koi khaas asar nahin he
 Rajasthan has reduced tax by 2 rupees 21 paise, yet petrol is 81 rupees 21 paise
 dijal 75 rupee 12 paise litre he
 During the Bharat Bandh in 2012, Arun Jaitley made an accurate prediction while in opposition
 yahi ki agar sarkaron ne tex ko sahi nahin kiya to is tarah ke pradarshan hote rahenge
 The public is happy in the politics of petrol and diesel
 ab uske paas dosha dene ke liye koi nahin bachaa he
 Now she will not be able to blame anyone for 50 years because Amit Shah has said that the BJP will remain in power for 50 years on the strength of its work
 kya us kaam main petrol or deazal ke daam kam karne kaa bhi kaam shaamil he
 It is a question or it is not a question at all
 10 sitambar ko vipaksh kaa bharat band tha
 The Prime Minister's statement was printed in the morning newspapers that the Congress had failed in the government as well as in the opposition
 congress kaa band tha ki modi sarkaar fail he lekin unke netaaon ne jab akhbaar haath main uthaaya hoga to yahi padhaa hoga ki vahi fail hai
 In this politics of failure versus failure, keep an eye on your vehicle tank
 congress ke bharat band ko 20 se zyada vipakshi dalon kaa saath mila he
 Rahul Gandhi went to Rajghat with different party leaders
 maansarovar se jo jal laae the use baapu kii samadhi par chadhaaya or phir vipakshi dalon ke saath march karte hue rajghat se ramlila maidan pahunche
 They traveled for up to three kilometer
 is march main ensipi, jedes, argedy, areldi, sapa, basapa, tiemasi or aam aadmi party ke netaaon ne hissaa liya or ramlila maidan ke manch par saath nazar aae
 Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena have also participated in this bandh
 amit shah ne bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main kaha he ki 2019 main aane ke baad agle 50 saal tak bhaajapa ko koi nahin haraa sakegaa
 He also made it clear that he is not doing this in ego, but because of his work no one will be able to defeat BJP
 is lihaaz se 2069 tak bhaajapa kii hi sarkaar rahegi
 The story of Bharat Bandh has faded ahead of this humble prediction of Amit Shah
 phir bhi aap note karen ki elahabaad main congressi kaaryakarta do gadhon ko majaboor kar rahe hai ki wo car khinchen
 What was the fault of these donkeys in increasing the price of petrol? gadhon ne mujhe exclusive baatcheet main kaha he ki unhen nahin pataa ki petrol mahangaa ho gaya he kyonki jab sasta hota he tab bhi insaan unki peeth par boj kam nahin karata he
 These Congress workers are playing a bean by climbing a buffalo

 haath jod kar abhivadan kar rahe the
 Scooty was running on the handcart behind the rickshaw and a gas cylinder was running behind Scooty
 hamane friday flashbek main dikhaaya tha ki kaise bharat band ke vakt bijepi ne tarah tarah kaa idia nikaala tha taaki news channelon or akhabaaron main un tasveeron ko jagah mili or vipaksh ke band kii khabar pehle panne par pramukhataa se aa sake
 You will see the newspaper of September 11
 desh ke kai hisson main vipaksh ke kaaryakartao ne jhande binakar ke saath march kiya
 Somewhere the market is closed and somewhere the highway gets jammed
 hamane yah sab apni librari ke archive main rakhane ke liye dikhaaya he
 Just as today people are viraling the link of statements of Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Shahnawaz Hussain before 2014, in the same way after 2069, i will share the link of prime time as Amit Shah has said that in 2019 After winning, nobody will be able to defeat BJP for 50 years
 bijepi netaa or kendiy mantri ravishankar prasad ne band ko loktantric adhikaar bataate hue kaha ki jo hinsa hui he uske liye koun zimmedaar he
 He said that the people of Congress and Opposition are creating fear in anger
 in sab baton kii aalochana karte hue ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki petrol deazal kaa daam badhanaa hamaare haath ke baahar he
 So you heard
 dijal or petrol kaa badhanaa hamaare haath ke baahar he
 Would this not have been the international cause during the Bharat Bandh of BJP? phir tab vipaksh ne bharat band kyon kiya
 Then why did Ravi Shankar Prasad ride a bicycle taking part in the bandh
 ek video main ravishankar prasad cycle chalaate hue petrol deazal ke daam kaa virodh karte dikhte hai
 Even at that time there were international reasons
 kachche tel kaa daam 109 dollars prati bairal tak ho gaya tha
 Then Arun Jaitley had said that petrol should be 50 rupees a liter at $ 90 per barrel
 is vakt 78 dollar prati bairal he, jetali ji 50 rupee litre petrol kyon nahin kar dete hai
 Talking to our affiliate channel on 23 May 2012, Ravi Shankar Prasad was rejecting the logic of international causes based on what information
 tab hamaari sahyogi ankar ne prasad se poocha tha ki aap satta main hote to kya karte to unhone kaha tha ham jab satta main aaengo to arthvyavastha ko is tarah se manage karenge ki aise jatke ko bardaasht kar le
 Now the question is from them that what you have managed is that the shock is unable to be tolerated and petrol has been reduced to 89 rupees a liter
 ye to upie ke samay bhi nahin hua tha
 In this reply, Ravi Shankar Prasad is also saying that he understands the rise in the price of crude oil, but even when the price of crude oil is low, the government does not reduce the price of petrol diesel
 2014 main modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad to international market main kachche tel kii keemat girte girte 2016 tak kareeb 41 dollars prati bairal ho gai thi
 Did the prices come down in the ratio in which the price of crude oil decreased
 2012 main kachche tel kii ausat keemat 109 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch gai
 Then petrol 73 in May 2012 in Delhi
 18 rupee litre pahunch gaya tha
 In 2017, when the average price of crude oil was 52
 51 dollar prati bairal ho gai
 Then in Delhi on 3rd Sibantar 2017 69 was 55 paise per liter
 aap dekh sakenge ki endieke samay kachche tel kii keemat kareeb 51 dollar prati bairal hone par bhi petrol 69 rupee litre mila or upie ke samay 2012 main 107 dollar prati bairal hone par kareeb 69 rupee prati litre aapane diya
 This is a game
 aaj congress or bijepi ke bich twitor par graphics ke zarie bhi jang hui
 The BJP has not stated the ratio of crude oil prices in its graphics
 bijepi ke graphics chart ke anusaar 16 may 2004 ko petrol 33
 71 paisa was liter, which was 40 rupees 62 paise on 16 May 2009
 yani paanch saal main 20 pratishat zyada badha
 Then on May 16, 2014, 71 rupees 41 paise per liter i
e
 75
 8 pratishat bad gaya
 Now on September 10, 2018, 80 rupees 73 paise per liter, which has been reduced by 13 percent
 kya vaaki daam ghate hai
 In response to this, Congress has tweeted
 congress ne kachche tel ke daam ke anusaar bataaya he
 According to this chart, in August 2009 and September 2018, both the time the price of crude oil 71
 9 dollars prati bairal thi
 In comparison, on 10 August 2009, petrol in the UPA government was 44 rupees 63 paise
 modi sarkaar main 10 sitambar 2018 ko 80 rupee 73 paise prati litre ho gaya he
 Price increase that decreased
 janata congress bijepi kaa iz iklaval tu game dekh rahi he
 bjp's graphics have reduced prices while your pocket has increased
 kya kamai badi
 Anandya Chakraborty has told in his simple news that 8 of GDP
 2 pratishat hone ke baad bhi logon kii asli aamadani main kaaphi giravat ai he
 You can see the simple news of the actors on the website of NDTV
 unka kahana he ki aamadani se mudrasphiti ko edjust kar dene par kisaanon kii asli aamadani na dekhne laayak he na dikhaane laayak he
 Between april-june 2017 to april-june 2018, income per farmer increased from Rs 100 to 101
 60 paise badi he
 That is, 1 rupee 60 paise
 yahi raftaar rahi to 100 se 200 hone main 44 saal lagenge
 Farmers' income will double by then
 tippaniyan It is good that till then BJP will remain the government because BJP President Amit Shah has said that BJP will remain in government for 50 years i
e
 till 2069
 ho saktaa he ki petrol deazal mahangaa hone or naukariyaan nahin milane ke baad bhi bhaajapa ko janata kaa apaar samarthan miltaa rahe lekin isaki vajah se janata ko takalif nahin he yah baat bhi sahi nahin
 Today, Rahul Singh of Hindustan Times reports that the Indian Army is going to reduce one and a half lakh jobs in the next 4-5 years
 iske liye june ke maheene main kader kii kshamta kii samiksha karne ke aadesh die gaye hai
 a panel of 11 members has been formed which will also consider reducing the number force
 baaki report aap hindustan times main padhein
 This information should be reached in time to the youths who run day and night to join the army in the village countryside
 andhra pradesh or rajasthan ne tex main kami kii he magar daam par koi khaas asar nahin he
 Rajasthan has reduced tax by 2 rupees 21 paise, yet petrol is 81 rupees 21 paise
 dijal 75 rupee 12 paise litre he
 During the Bharat Bandh in 2012, Arun Jaitley made an accurate prediction while in opposition
 yahi ki agar sarkaron ne tex ko sahi nahin kiya to is tarah ke pradarshan hote rahenge
 The public is happy in the politics of petrol and diesel
 ab uske paas dosha dene ke liye koi nahin bachaa he
 Now she will not be able to blame anyone for 50 years because Amit Shah has said that the BJP will remain in power for 50 years on the strength of its work
 kya us kaam main petrol or deazal ke daam kam karne kaa bhi kaam shaamil he
 It is a question or it is not a question at all
 congress ke bharat band ko 20 se zyada vipakshi dalon kaa saath mila he
