 In the modern era, the human mind has become busier than before
 ham email, fasebuk, miseging jaise kai kaam ek saath karne kii koshish karte hai
 Multi tasking is affecting our brain power
 multitasking kii lat insaan ke kaam kii dakshata ko kam kar rahi he
 Neuroscientist Daniel Levitin is a well-known expert who has found after the study that in most people, the loss of forgetfulness and efficiency is due to multitasking
 puraane jamaane kii tulana main aaj log lagaataar multitasking par dhyaan de rahe hai
 People think that they are doing many things at once
 ghar ke saamaan kii list se lekar email karnaa, doston se baaten karnaa, raste main aate-jate lagaataar mobile yuj karnaa
 But have we ever thought that this is affecting the brain, which is causing loss of efficiency
 dainiel Levitin ke anusaar, agar kisi ke inbox main ek massej vyastata kii vajah se bina padhaa rah gaya ho, to yahi sochakar vah apni 9 point IQ kho detaa he
 On the other hand, in the old days there were no wireless phones, so during a meeting or work, it was not known when the phone rang
 lekin aaj aisa nahin he
 Multitasking is exactly like a wizard's ball
 ek haath main or ek hawa main hoti he
 Don't know when to fall down
 usee tarah multitasking karne se dimag thak jaataa he
 The amount of energy needed to perform a task, multitasking reduces the amount of glucose quickly, and it is not known that power and efficiency are reduced

 At least this is the claim of the industry
 aaj tak se khaas baatcheet main uddhav ne bataaya ki kya he 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye kya he unki taiyaari or kaise raaj thakare ne hijank kar liya shivasena kaa agenda
 Maharashtra Navnirman Sena President Raj Thackeray has for the last few days opened a front against Asha Bhosle of Maharashtra and has warned that if Asha Bhosle shares the stage of Sur with Pakistani artists, she does not tolerate it
 lekin sur ke jariye chhide is sangram main ab ek naam or jud gaya he

 In the case of Asha Bhosle's protest, Uddhav Thackeray targeted Raj Thackeray as to why the protest was only for Asha Tai
 batoo baton main jab uddhav se ye poocha gaya ki kya 2014 ke chunaav main maharashtra main emenes ke saath nayaa chunavi gathbandhan saamne aayega to unhone na hi iskaa khandan kiya or na hi iske liye hami bhari
 Shiv Sena has been opposing cricket matches between Pakistan and India from the beginning, but listen this time

 It was revealed in the conversation that the Shiv Sena is not able to digest in any way how any other party can hijack their old issues and make it their own

 Finance Minister P
 Chidambaram has presented the General Budget for the year 2013-14 in the Parliament, but the politics of Bihar has started heating up
 mukhyamantri ne is bajet kii na keval prashansa kii he, balki vitt mantri ko badhai tak di he
 On the other hand, Deputy Chief Minister of the state Sushil Kumar Modi has described the budget as disappointing
 raajnneeti ke jaankaar ise bhavi raajnneeti se jodakar dekh rahe hai
 The Union Budget has not announced any special benefits for the common people of Bihar, but the Union Finance Minister has definitely won the heart of Chief Minister Nitish by proposing to change the criteria of special state status
 nitish kehete hai ki bajet bhaashan or aarthik surveykshan main vishesh rajya kaa darja ke liye vartmaan maapdand main badlaav kii baat kahi gai he jo yah sabit karata he ki bihar kii baton ko saidhantik rup se sweekaar kar liya gaya he
 This is a theoretical victory of the people of entire Bihar
 chidambaram iske liye badhai ke paatr hai
 Nitish Kumar has expressed hope that this announcement will soon be put into practice
 nitish ne haalanki chidambaram kii tarif kaa raajnneetik sameekaran se rishta nakaarte hue kaha ki iskaa koi raajnneetik arth nahin nikaalnaa chahie
 This announcement will open the way for the development of backward states like Bihar
 idhar, bihar kii satarudh rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) kii mukhya ghatak bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke netaa or rajya ke up mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne bajet ko niraashajanak kaha he
 They say that we have got only and only disappointment from this budget
 is bajet se bihar ko kaaphi mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padegaa kyonki bihar ke bajet main ab raashi ke vitaran ko lekar bahut si samasyaayein khadi ho gai hai
 He said that more budget was needed for the development of Bihar
 rajya kii raajnneeti ho yaa desh kii raajnneeti aisa bahut kam hi mauka aayaa he jab mukhyamantri ke bayaan se up mukhyamantri kaa bayaan ulat najar aayaa ho
 Politics also say that whenever a BJP leader has made a comment against the Chief Minister's statement, Modi has also tried to bridge that gap
 aise main modi kaa bayaan kai myne rakhata he
 Both Congress and Chief Minister know that it is not easy to get special state status to Bihar
 aaj nitish ko chhodkar kisi bhi vipakshi netaa ne bajet kii prashansa nahin kii he
 Both Nitish and Congress are doing politics on this issue
 congress nitish ko bich-bich main mithi goli dekar mudde ko garma detii he
 This issue can have a profound impact in Bihar politics in the future
 janata party adhyaksh subrahmanyam swami ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh se purv doorsanchaar mantri e raja ko aalaa darje kii suraksha ke tahat rakhane ko kaha

 unhone kaha ki raja ke paas satta main baithe kuch logon ke bare main pareshaan karne vaali ahm suchanaaen hai
 No less than a nightmare for pollsters in Bengal, while Gujarat is the easiest state for them to work
 ye kahana he exis maai india ke agrani surveykshak pradeep gupta kaa
 Gupta made this comment when he was asked about the biggest exercise to take the hearts of the people of India for the 2019 general election
 19 may ko aakhri charan kaa matdaan sampann hone ke saath hi india today tivi par exis maai india post pole survey ke aankade dikhaane shuru kiye jaaenge
 The hard work that must have been done behind surveying more than 7 lakh participants in 542 constituencies can only be gauged
 gupta ne india today ko bataaya ki bharat ke vibhinnataaon vaale rajyon main pratibhaagiyon kaa survey badi chunauti tha
 The difficulty level was estimated based on several parameters, state by state
 dar ke saae mengupta ne bataaya ki bengal main is baar survey karnaa bahut mushkil tha or yahaan survey kii chunauti 2014 se zyaada mushkil thi
 He attributed this to issues related to law and order
 gupta ne kaha, “jab ham koshish karte hai or logon se baat karte hai, wo atirek vaali pratikriya dete or hamen shaq kii nigaah se dekhte
 Their thinking looks as if they believe that BJP or Congress has sent us because there is Trinamool Congress ruling party
 ”gupta ke mutabik bengal main wo ‘maun voter’ se mili
 Gupta told that this voter is not the one the media talks about
 gupta kehete hai ki media kii shabdaawalee main jis voter tak media pahunch nahin paata wo ‘maun voter’ hota he
 Gupta said, “it was the fear-factor in Bengal that we included in our final analysis
 log apni raajnneetik pasand nahin bataa rahe hai
 Faithful people of a particular party prefer to remain silent because they fear that 'others' will beat them
 ”gupta ne kaha, “ye dilachasp he ki bijepi ke voter sivaae bengal ke har jagah apni raajnneetik pasand ko bataane ke liye bade utsahit dikhe
 Whereas in Bengal, the opposite was seen
 trinmul ko vot karne vaale yahaan mukhar dikhe
 But voters of non-tmc parties preferred to remain silent
 ”haalanki exis maai india un votaron tak pahunchane tak main kaamyaab rahaa jo surveykshakon kii talash main the jinke saamne wo apni raajnneetik pasand ko vyakt kar saken
 Geographical Constraints Hardly speaking, the names of Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh come at the top in terms of geographical constraints
 gupta kehete hai, “madhya pradesh or karnataka bade rajya hai, yahaan ek jagah se duusare jagah pahunchane main adhik vakt lagata he
 “hill states like Northeast, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir are difficult to travel
 gupta kehete hai, “saamaanya sthiti main 20 kilometre kaa kshetra cover karne ke liye aam taur par 25-30 minute lagate hai
 But in hilly states, this time is two hours
 ”agar sthaneey maanav sansadhano kii baat kii jaae to kerala or odisha bhi chunaav surveykshakon ke liye badi mushkil vaale hai
 Gupta says, "it is important that you have people who not only understand the local language but can easily communicate with the local participants in the regional dialect
 aisi sthiti main hi pratibhaagi hamase jud pate hai or tathy bataane ko taiyaar hote hai
 If this is not taken care of then it is impossible to work in Kerala and Odisha
 ”mausam kii mushkilanjab bhari garmi main chunaav itane charnon main failaa ho to kaise mausam kii mushkilon ko nazarandaaz kiya ja saktaa he
 According to Gupta, the most critical state in this case is Uttar Pradesh
 gupta se jab poocha gaya ki survey ke liye sabase aasaan rajya koun sa he to unhone jhat se ‘gujarat’ kaa naam liya
 Gupta said, "it is easy to get there, there are no geographical or administrative barriers
 log zyaada madad karne vaale hai
 They are simple so do not refuse to talk
 ” haalanki gupta ne saath hi joda ki gujarat main mahilaon se baat karnaa mushkil he
 Conversion Rate What does conversion rate mean? This means how many positive responses a surveyor receives every ten doors as part of his study
 metro shaharon main canavarzan dar jahaan 10 main se 6 rahati he, vahiin gramin kshetron main ye 10 main se 8 he
 But Gujarat looked different in this case
 yahaan kshetra shahari ho yaa gramin canavarzan dar 10 main se 8-9 rahi
 Axis My India described Madhya Pradesh as a good state for survey
 gupta ne kaha, madhya pradesh main pratibhaagiyon main bhay jaisi koi baat nahin dikhi
 For example, in Madhya Pradesh, the factor of fear showed why there are four important parties, two national and two regional parties
 pratibhaagi hameshaa yahi sochate hai ki kisi or party ne bheja he
 Therefore, they are hesitant to state their political choices
 jati or dharm ke samikarnjab jamini str par jati or dharmik samikarnon ko bhi maddenzar liya jaae to survey kii prakriya chunauteepurn ho jaati he
 Gupta says, "if you are a Hindu and surveying a Muslim, then he will look at you from another point of view
 isi tarah ek muslim agar brahman pratibhaagi se baat karata he to wo pratibhaagi alag tareeke se baat karegaa
 Finally, leading surveyor Gupta made a critical comment about NOTA
 gupta ne kaha, “NOTA is chunaav main factor hoga
 In 2014, 6 million people pressed the button on NOTA, this time this number may be higher

 aakhirkaar meraa sapana puraa ho gaya
 Now in my courtyard, there will be a bully of children dressed in a whitewashed dress
 jis ground par ghutanon tak pani bharaa rahata tha vahaan kaaleen bichhegi
 Thinking of all this, my heart is becoming garden-garden
 har roj alsaae,sustaae or murajhaae se bacchemaile-kuchaile kapade pahanakar jab get se ghuste the to meraa ji michalaane lagata tha
 When the mid-day meal was served on their plate, the flies buzzing on them and the noses of those children drowned in me, but i am glad that every day long cars will stop at the door
 unamem se nahaye-dhoe bachche utrenge
 Whose clothes would also have been immersed in a bucket of perfume
 makhmali dress vaali jo mahilaayein mujhe dekhte hi naak sikodkar nikal jaati thim, wo bhi ab mere daravaaje par rukengi
 Between the red and blue light hooters, when the mummies will speak to their children lovingly at the school gate, seeing this, Master ji will also have a 56-inch chest and in this joy, perhaps by mistake, take the right book
 ab har roj lunch box main roti or paraathon ke alaava burgers or pasta bhi dikhegaa
 The fragrance of dry fruits will make me feel satisfied
 jis skool main bachche kabhi langadi khel se aage nahin jaan paae vahaan ab doramon or chota bhim kii bhi charchaa hogi
 The thorny grass that grows on my chest will now be cut every other day
 yahaan bhi palm ke khubasurat ped laharaayenge
 Children of great people will now sit with sardons and chutkis, and my heart will hesitate like waves of the sun
 is khushi se main phool ke kuppa ho rahaa hum
 i thank the court or the upstairs who have returned my 'good days'
 ab meri selfi bhi fasebuk kii tamaam prophilon par laharaayegi
 Feel free to update the status of 'feeling Ausam' on Facebook quickly

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi says that PM Modi is on a visit to India
 pradhanmantri kii tabadatod videsh yatraaon par kataaksh karte hue unhone yah bayaan diya
 Significantly, in view of the considerable activism in foreign policy in the Kimodi government, it is even being said that he is also handling the responsibility of the Ministry of External Affairs himself
 lekin aisa he nahin
 Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj has proved that she is the real foreign minister
 1
 Sushma Swaraj traveled more than PM Narendra Modi During the course of a year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has traveled to eight countries
 vahiin videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne isse doguna 16 deshon kaa daura kiya he

 piem modi ne aath mulkon kaa daura kiya, jinamein se 8 asian hai
 Swaraj traveled to 16 countries, 14 of which are Asian

 Sushma Swaraj also handled complex issues PM Modi met high profile leaders from USA, Russia, China, UK and France

 Sushma Swaraj also touched humanity and familiarity in foreign policy matters even in complex issues
 iskaa parichay rajyasabha main die unke ek bhaashan main mila
 Speaking on the issue of Indian laborers abducted in Iraq, Swaraj said, "I am waiting like a mother waiting for her son to return
" 
 
 maine har wo darwaja khatkhataya, jahaan se madad mil sakati thi
 'modi's global reach and low-profile, making Sushma Swaraj's entry into the country so clever, makes it clear that good days have come in the country or not, good days have come for our foreign policy

 Terming the National Medical Commission Bill 2017 as anti-people and anti-patient, the Indian Medical Association on Tuesday called for private hospitals across the country to be closed for 12 hours
 loksabhaa main is bill ke pesh hone ke saath hi iskaa virodh shuru ho gaya he
 The bill, introduced by Union Health Minister JP Nadda, provides for the creation of four autonomous boards under the National Medical Commission
 inkaa kaam under graduate or post graduate shiksha ko dekhne ke alaava chikitsa sansthaanon kii manyata or doctoron ke panjikaran kii vyavastha ko dekhnaa hoga

 But Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan rejected his demand

 The IMA says that this will reduce the level of medical treatment on a large scale and it will play with patient care and safety
 ieme kaa kahana he ki aadhunik chikitsa paddati ke tahat practice ke liye embibies kaa maanak bana rahanaa chahie
 The ima's objection is mainly about the bill that states have no involvement in this commission
 brij course ko embibies ke baraabar kaa darja diya ja rahaa he
 Also, the NEET exam level has been kept very high, so that only 40 percent of the students will be able to pass the exam
 isko ames ke baraabar darja diya gaya he, jisase aam student pareshaani main pad sakate hai
 The National Medical Commission has also objected to the provision of the bill in which the management has been empowered to fix the fees of the seats
 privet medical collejon main 15% siton kaa fees management tay karti thi lekin ab nae bill ke mutabik management ko 60% siton kii fees tay karne kaa adhikaar hoga
 The IMA termed this bill as anti-people and anti-patient, saying that on one hand this bill is being brought to end corruption, while it will lead to flood of corruption
 ieme ne kaha he ki unhen ye bill unhen manjuur nahin he or ye bill chikitsa kshetra se jude hue logon ke saath-saath marijon ke liye kaala din he

 If you are a normal employee and you are worried about increasing salary at the rate of 10 percent or 15 percent then you can dream of becoming an MLA or MP
 desh ke alag-alag rajyon main nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ne apni selary badhaane ke jo kirtiman kaayam kiye hai usase janata mahaan ko prerana milani chahie ki wo bhi kuch aisa kare ki apni selary jise kabhi darmaha or tankhwaah kehete the, 100 pratishat se adhik badha le
 Surely, our mlas will suffer the misery of not increasing the salary of the public, only then they take revenge by increasing their salary by 400 percent
 'selary bhi kabhi badhati thi' ye serial aap aam log dekhiye ham aapako 'aaj bhi selary bad sakati he' tip kii nai film dikhaate hai
 The salary and convenience of the poor mlas of the newly formed province of Deccan has increased by 160 percent
 maan lijie aapaki selary maheene kii 10,000 he wo april se badhkar 26000 ho jaae to aap khushi ke maare koodeinge ki nahin
 But you watch silently because your turn of jump has not come yet
 ab vidhayakon kii selary 95,000 se badhkar dhai lakh ho gai he
 The salary of ministers has increased from 2 lakh 40 thousand to 4 lakh
 is babat somvaar ko vidhansabha main ek bill pesh hua or bina virodh ke paas bhi ho gaya
 The proposal was to make three and a half lakhs per month, but look at the sensitivity of the mlas, only increased by 2
5 lakhs
 wo bhi sarvasammati se
 Telangana is a budding state
 karza sirf 61000 karod he lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki iske karodpati vidhayak dhai lakh kii selary na le saken
 You know that the first election was held in April 2014 in Telangana and 119 mlas were elected
 association for democratic rifarm ne pataa kiya 119 main sirf 83 vidhayak hi mili jo karodpati hai
 There are 6 mlas whose movable fixed assets are more than 30 crores, 36 mlas are non-millionaires
 3 vidhayak aise hai jinaki sampatti 18 lakh se kam hai
 The property of one of these three is just 1 lakh 82 thousand movable property
 telugana ke mukhyamantri ke chandrashekhar raav ne media se kaha he ki ve sthiti ko samajhe
 i do not know the rest of the media but i have understood since his appeal
 tabhi aapako samajha rahaa hum ki kya acha lagegaa ki 83 karodpati vidhayakon kii selary lakh rupee bhi na ho
 One of these mla's movable immovable property is more than 111 crores
 bataaiye wo kisi ko laaj ke maare kah nahin pate honge ki 95,000 selary he
 We only understand the suffering of the poor, but we should also understand the hesitation of the rich
 is angel se sochenge to aap bhi vidhayakon kii selary badhane kii khushi main shaamil ho paayenge
 The honorable Chief Minister has explained in detail the reasons for increasing salary, which has been published by Deccan Chronicle newspaper
 main aap darshakon se apil karata hum ki pleez vidhayakon ke dard ko bhi samajhiye
 Listen to what the Chief Minister is saying
 unhone kaha, tees saal pehle jab main vidhayak bana to 500 rupee prati maah hi selary thi, lekin ab aarthik paridrishy badal gaya he
 The salary allowance bill of the mlas is very modest, ahead of the state's one lakh crore budget
 ek vidhayak 30 cametiyon kaa sadsy hota he, use inaki baithkon main janaa hota he District council meetings have to go, everyday hundred and fifty people come to work, who have to drink tea, otherwise people get angry
 driver or nijee staff rakhana padataa he
 Food expenses of security personnel also have to be spent
 to ab se vidhayakon ke suraksha karmiyon se apil hai ki ve jam kar khaayen kyonki manyavar ji kii tankhwaah bad gai he
 But what the Chief Minister said is wrong
 shaayad nahin
 He also said that mlas have to pay donations during temples and festivals
 ye bahut badi samasya he
 Nowadays, many mlas say that cricket competition is going on in every village and the youth has harassed them by asking for donations
 kya ham ek baar bhi sochate hai ki chanda dena vidhayak kaa kaam nahin he
 The Chief Minister said that those who have the responsibility of nation building should get good salary
 sawaal to tab uthta he jab raashtra nirmaan main hi lage dusron logon kaa itani tatparta se khyaal nahin rakhaa jaataa
 The state of Telangana was born as the 29th state of India in May 2014, since then 2100 farmers have committed suicide
 sirf 400 pariwaron ko hi muawza mila he
 You know about a company where everyone's salary rises at a rate
 jaise vidhayakon kii badhati he
 Do all mlas have the same performance
 pichley saal dilli sarkaar ne apane vidhayakon kii selary 400 pratishat badha di to kaaphi hangaamaa hua tha
 Increased from 88,000 to 2 lakh rupees per month
 yah bill centre sarkaar ke paas lambit he or abhi tak manzuri nahin mili he arthath dilli ke vidhayakon ko badi hui selary nahin mil rahi he
 Then the BJP mlas said in the mood that they had come for public service and would work on a salary of one rupee
 ab jab centre se manzuri mil jaaegi tabhi pataa chalegaa ki ye vidhayak ek rupee main kaam karenge yaa puri selary lenge
 The salary of Telangana mlas is more than Delhi

 The salary of ministers has increased from 2 lakh 40 thousand to 4 lakh
 is babat somvaar ko vidhansabha main ek bill pesh hua or bina virodh ke paas bhi ho gaya
 The proposal was to make three and a half lakhs per month, but look at the sensitivity of the mlas, only increased by 2
5 lakhs
 wo bhi sarvasammati se
 Telangana is a budding state
 karza sirf 61000 karod he lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki iske karodpati vidhayak dhai lakh kii selary na le saken
 You know that the first election was held in April 2014 in Telangana and 119 mlas were elected
 association for democratic rifarm ne pataa kiya 119 main sirf 83 vidhayak hi mili jo karodpati hai
 There are 6 mlas whose movable fixed assets are more than 30 crores, 36 mlas are non-millionaires
 3 vidhayak aise hai jinaki sampatti 18 lakh se kam hai
 The property of one of these three is just 1 lakh 82 thousand movable property
 telugana ke mukhyamantri ke chandrashekhar raav ne media se kaha he ki ve sthiti ko samajhe
 i do not know the rest of the media but i have understood since his appeal
 tabhi aapako samajha rahaa hum ki kya acha lagegaa ki 83 karodpati vidhayakon kii selary lakh rupee bhi na ho
 One of these mla's movable immovable property is more than 111 crores

 kya ham ek baar bhi sochate hai ki chanda dena vidhayak kaa kaam nahin he
 The Chief Minister said that those who have the responsibility of nation building should get good salary

 Telangana Chief Minister k Chandrasekhar Rao has told the media to understand the situation
 baaki media kaa to main nahin jaanata lekin main unki apil ke baad se samaj gaya hum
 Just then i am explaining to you that it would be nice if the salary of 83 crorepati mlas is not even Rs lakh
 inamen se ek vidhayak kii chal achal sampatti to 111 karod se adhik he
 Tell them that they would not be able to tell anyone that there is 95,000 salary
 ham log sirf garibon kii takaleef samajhate hai lekin hamen amiron kii jhijak bhi samajni chahie
 If you think from this angle, you will also be able to join the happiness of increasing the salary of mlas
 mananeey mukhyamantri ne selary badhane ke kaarnon ko vistaar se bataaya he jise deccan chronical akhbaar ne chapa he
 i appeal to you audience that please understand the pain of legislators
 jo mukhyamantri kah rahe hai wo suniye
 He said, thirty years ago, when i became an MLA, the salary was only 500 rupees per month, but now the economic scenario has changed
 vidhayakon kaa selary bhatta bill rajya ke ek lakh karod ke bajet ke aage to bahut maamuli he
 a legislator is a member of 30 committees, he has to attend their meetings
 zila parishad kii baithkon main janaa hota he, rose sau-pachaas log kaam lekar aa jate hai, jinhen chaay pilaani padati he varna log naaraaz ho jate hai
 Have to hire a driver and personal staff
 suraksha karmchaaree ke khaane kaa kharchaa bhi nikaalnaa hota he
 So from now on, there is an appeal to the security personnel of the mlas to eat it hard because the salary of Manyavar ji has increased
 lekin jo mukhyamantri ne kaha kya wo galat he
 Probably not
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vidhayakon ko mandir or tyoharon ke vakt chande dene padate hai
 This is a big problem
 aaj kal kai vidhayak bataate hai ki gaanv-gaanv main cricket pratiyogita hone lagi he or iske liye chanda maang maang kar yuvakon ne pareshaan kar diya he
 Do we think even once that donating money is not the job of MLA
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki jinke upar raashtra nirmaan kii zimmedaari he unhen acchhee selary milani chahie
 The question arises when the people engaged in nation building are not taken care of so promptly
 may 2014 main bharat ke 29 wein rajya ke rup main telugana rajya kaa janm hua, tab se ab tak 2100 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 Only 400 families have received compensation
 aap kisi company ke bare main jaanate hai jahaan sabaki selary ek rate par badhati he
 As legislators grow
 kya sabhi vidhayakon kaa pradarshan ek samaan hota he
 Last year, there was a lot of uproar when the Delhi government increased the salary of its mlas by 400 percent
 88,000 se badhaakar 2 lakh rupee prati maah kar di gai
 The bill is pending with the central government and is yet to be approved, meaning Delhi legislators are not getting the increased salary
 tab bijepi ke vidhayakon ne bhavavesh main kah diya ki ve janaseva ke liye aae hai or ek rupee kii selary par kaam karenge
 Now when we get the approval from the Center, only then will we know whether these mlas will work for one rupee or take full salary
 telugana ke vidhayakon kii selary dilli se bhi zyada he
 Similarly, on Tuesday, the Madhya Pradesh cabinet has decided to increase the salary of mlas
 71,000 prati maah se badhaakar 1 lakh 10 hazaar karne kaa prastaav kiya gaya he
 It is proposed to increase the salary of the ministers to 1 lakh seventy thousand
 mukhyamantri kaa vetan 1 lakh 43 hazaar se badhaakar 2 lakh prati maah kiya gaya he
 This includes salary and allowances
 9 saal main chauthi baar vidhayakon kaa vetan badha he
 In Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly too, the salary allowance bill of mlas has been passed on Tuesday i
e
 March 30
 ab vidhayakon kii selary 95,000 se badhkar 1 lakh 25 hazaar ho jaaegi
 Residential allowance has been increased from 25,000 to 50,000
 98,000 se 1 lakh tak ke railway coupon diye jaayenge
 20,000 rupees for magazine and books vidhansabha kshetra ke liye bhatta 1 lakh 38 hazaar milegaa jo pehle 83,000 rupee tha
 The comments telugana, andhra pradesh, madhya pradesh ke vidhayakon ne to holi ke baad hi diwaali bhi manaani shuru kar di he
 According to the decision of the Chhattisgarh government's cabinet on Tuesday, the salary of mlas has been increased from 75,000 to 1 lakh ten thousand per month
 ek report ke anusaar puure desh main telugana ke vidhayakon kii selary sabase adhik he
 We should consider the matter of salary of mlas with reasonableness
 unhen vidhayaki ke kaam ke liye sansaadhan kii zarurat to he lekin kya sabhi vidhayakon kaa pradarshan ek sa hota he
 Legislators' houses are crowded by ordinary people or activists
 unki drawing room main kiski pahunch hoti he ye wo bhi jaanate hai or aap bhi jaanate hai
 Salaries also increase in companies, but they do not grow according to 160 percent and do not grow equally
 26 november 2015 ke din enditivi proffit kii site par khabar lagi he ki 2016 ke saal main bhartiya companiyon main vetan 10
 Will increase only 8 percent
 agar aap 6
 If we calculate the inflation rate of 1 percent, then this increase is 4
 7 pratishat kii hogi
 The legislator is fine
 apni selary sau dedh sau pratishat badha lete hai isamen mudrasphiti kii 5-6 pratishat kahaan gum ho jaati hogi kisi ko pataa hi nahin chalata hoga
 It is obvious that our farmers are longing for better prices, they come in debt but it never grows
 sarkari karmchaariyon kaa mahangaai bhatta samay se badhata rahata he
 The Seventh Pay Commission is coming
 hamaare vidhayakon kii selary kitni badhani chahie, badhane kaa aadhaar kya hona chahie, kyon nahin badhani chahie or badhani kyon chahie
 If you want many answers, then watch prime time
 to ab se vidhayakon ke suraksha karmiyon se apil hai ki ve jam kar khaayen kyonki manyavar ji kii tankhwaah bad gai he
 But what the Chief Minister said is wrong
 shaayad nahin
 He also said that mlas have to pay donations during temples and festivals
 ye bahut badi samasya he
 Nowadays, many mlas say that cricket competition is going on in every village and the youth has harassed them by asking for donations
 kya ham ek baar bhi sochate hai ki chanda dena vidhayak kaa kaam nahin he
 The Chief Minister said that those who have the responsibility of nation building should get good salary
 sawaal to tab uthta he jab raashtra nirmaan main hi lage dusron logon kaa itani tatparta se khyaal nahin rakhaa jaataa
 The state of Telangana was born as the 29th state of India in May 2014, since then 2100 farmers have committed suicide

 5 starchaar dost hai
 Gaurav, Devi, Dev and Aadi
 gaurav boxr he or uskaa baap ahlavat bahubali mantri
 Dev wants to start an adventure camp business
 aatankwaadiyon se ladakar shahid hue faujee afasar kii beti devi apni maa ke gharelu udyog main madad karti he
 All are called Haggu by Aadi and his tradesman is the business of the father's commode
 yani stage set he
 Fultu for fun
 or jahaan garaari funs jaae
 The name of Gaurav's father comes to work there
 magar devi ke ek loche ko solve karne ke pher main ye takar jate hai ek sharaabi, ayyash or shiv ke upaask jat police afasar chautaala se
 Then Chautala makes them dance dance and they do kathak or disco bhangra sometimes
 aakhir main sabaki aatma jaagti he
 The system is corrupt and to change it, these people make some very revolutionary plans
 taaki desh kii fagali surat kuch saaf ho sake
 The story of the film is very weak and confused
 jo yuva raat main sharaab pikar duusare deshon kaa jhanda ukhaadte or thullon ko gariyaate phirte hai, ve khud par padati he to system saaf karne nikal padate hai
 And the path he chooses is also very childish
 media ko behad haasyaaspad dhang se pesh kiya gaya he
 a journalist arrives at the burning unit, and doctors help him as well
 phir vahiin se live halafanama shuru ho jaataa he
 On the other hand there are mlas, who start firing in front to celebrate and they do not even know that the policeman is coming
 matlab, kahani banane ke liye chun chunakar thake hue item nae work main pesh kiye gaye hai
 English word cliche
 mere bagal main baithi mohatarama baar baar doharaa rahi thim or sahi doharaa rahi thim is film ko dekhakar
 The girl with the veil in front of Haggu
 magar gharavaalon ke jate hi ladki ghunghat phenk mordan ban jaati he or cigarette maangane lagati he
 Haggu also starts staring at her chest
 adventure camp main vahi masti ke naam par chand sitaron kii baaten
 Some sadness and a philosophy in between
 desi naach ke naam par kuch kuch hota he ki junior anjali or ab senior ho chuki actress sanaa said kaa ek phufakaarta karahata item song
 Seeing the trailer of the film, mostly songs, rap and a few Haryanvi style dialogues, it seemed that the film youth would like it very much
 magar kachra kahani or aakhir main har badmaashi ko ek makasad or shahahat kaa rang dene ke pher main sab chhichhaledar ho jaati he
 Three people have debuted from the film
 mohit marwaah, kiyaara or vijender
 Mohit Marwah is cute and his build is also good
 dance bhi thik thaak kar lete hai
 And then he also has a backup of the elder kapoor-marwah family
 to unke liye raah aage khuli he
 Kiara also does not disappoint for the first film
 vijender zyaadaatar shots main flats phase liye khadey rahete hai
 Can say that it is necessary to do this for dry humer
 par jahaan acting yaa dance kii jarurat thi, vahaan bhi vijender bas hawa main mukka laharaate hi dikhte hai
 It would be better if Vijender, with good looks and punch, does modeling and boxing
 acting kii ring unke bas kii baat nahin
 Jimmy Shergill has done such roles in Biwi Gangster and many similar films
 unke liye karne ko bahut kuch tha nahin
 In the role of sugar, Anshuman Jha once again introduces his acting range and preparation
 magar unke hisse zyada kaam nahin aayaa
 Actor Kabir Sadanand has made his debut as a director through the film Fagli
 unhone hit debyue ke kai jaruri element jutaaye
 But he missed the story
 pehle half main to film phir bhi kuch thik lagati he or yuvaaon kii masti or gane ke sahare cat jaati he, magar duusare half main ye jo khinchati he to phir ub kii had tak khinch jaati he
 The songs of the film Fagli are a hit and one does not need to go to the cinema hall to listen to them
 agar hariyaanvi humar, youth apil or yang phase ke daai hard fain hai, tabhi is film ko dekhne jaaen
 Otherwise ask at home
 ye fagali fagali kya he

 ' The world of built heritage has traditionally been interfered with by experts who catalog and preserve it, interpreting those monuments and sites
 yah dayera saarvajanik halake main bhi apni bhoomika lagaataar badha rahaa he
 However, there are obstacles and opportunities as well, because even the remaining people who claim the monopoly of the experts will challenge
 yah baat dilli main haal hi main hue ek aayojan main saaf hui
 From December 11 to 15, several experts gathered to host the triennial general meeting of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS)
 isioemoes is kaam main laga duniya kaa sabase bada nijee sanghathan he or yahi vishwa viraasat kii suchi taiyaar karne ke kaam main unesco ko bhi salaah detaa he
 The India branch of this organization was recently re-energized and in a short span of time hosted the largest gathering of the organization, which was attended by more than a thousand people representing over a hundred countries
 sabha main chaar samanaantar satron main takreeban 200 prajentation die gaye
 The original theme chosen by the Indian hosts for this discussion was heritage and democracy
 shaayad is vishay ko chunane ke peeche yah bhav rahaa hoga ki in donon hi chizon kii bharat ke paas bahulata he
 Of course, these are the cases in which India can present itself with full authority in front of the remaining hundred countries
 sawaal yah he ki donon baaten kaise ek saath feet hoti hai? kaise nirmit viraasat ko sangrakshit rakhane se sabhi logon kaa bhala ho saktaa he or kya yah bhala sabakaa barabari ke aadhaar par ho saktaa he? is tarah ke sawaal phijul nahin hai
 Because even A-class monuments like the Taj Mahal do not remain beyond dispute
 is sandarbh main dekha jaae to adhiveshan ke pratinidhiyon kii ore se jari dilli ghoshnaptr kaaphi ahmiyat rakhata he
 It has received the approval of the government along with UNESCO
 ghoshnaptr tikaoo vikaas kii jan-aadhaarit pariklpana ke liye in donon hi baton ko mahatvapurn ghatak ke taur par dekhtaa he
 If we look deeply ahead of idealistic ideas, then many basic issues arise
 pehla he viraasat kii dharna kaa vistaar karnaa taaki usamen na keval smarak yaa phir imaaraton kaa koi samooh balki unka vinyas or aasapaas kaa bhudrishy bhi shaamil ho
 This stems from the concept that people's understanding of heritage sites is rooted in a broader context and therefore the larger perception is more inclusive and democratic
 isamen logon kii manyataon or mulyon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 Therefore, after approving the manifesto, the government may rethink its efforts to dilute the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites (amendment and Approval) Act of 2010, which were unanimously passed in Parliament
 us adhinium main smarakon ke irdagird pratibandhit or niyamit ilaake tay kiye gaye the
 His intention actually stemmed from this expanding concept of heritage which was based on people's (not just archaeologists') understanding of these sites
 lekin ab prastaav kiya gaya he ki 'jankaryon' ke liye in praavdhaanon ko kinare kar diya jaae
 But the question remains, what are these 'people' who seem to be the object of opposition from the people? The old mutual opposition between conservation and development cannot be measured on the basis of the needs of the poor versus the passion of some elite people
 ab yah tamaam logon kii jaruraton ke bare main he taaki ve viraasat ko tikaoo bhavishya main shaamil kar saken
 But what is his legacy? In light of the declaration's comment that 'legislative protection of heritage is the responsibility of governments of all levels', the Government of India can also take a quick glance at the last lines that emphasize an inclusive understanding of heritage
 'yah hamaari jimmedaari he ki ham us bahusaanskrithik, bahuaiami viraasat ke mahatv ko sangrakshit karen jo hamen pichhali peedi se mili he or use aane vaali peedhishon ke haathon main surakshit saunpen
 "yogi, who was invited to address the inaugural session of the General Assembly of ICOMOS and recently honored with Padma Bhushan, was seen by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev
 unhone vinamrata se sweekaar kiya ki ve itane saare visheshgyon kii maujuudagi main khud ko thodaa ashikshit samaj rahe hai
 But he offered a description of his vision of Indian culture, which needed not only to be preserved but also to be restored because 'we were under the rule of others for almost a thousand years'
 virodh kaa koi swar bamushkil hi sunai diya, shaayad jaggi ke kai jankaryon ke lihaaj kii vajah se
 But its intent was clear: those who believe that a religion of foreign origin cannot be Indian, not even after a thousand years; And whatever was prepared under the rule of the people of that religion is not a sign of Indian culture
 yani is hisaab se to bhartiya viraasat vividh nahin he or usamen keval ek hi sachhee parampara he jise tamaam mumkin tareekon se bataaya janaa chahie
 Recently, a decision of the Central Government came to mind after hearing Sadhguru's view of Indian history
 usamen usne kala or saanskrithik viraasat ke liye bhartiya rashtriya nyaas (intake) kii ore se dilli ko vishwa viraasat shahar ke rup main soochibaddh karne ke liye isioemoes ko bheje gaye prastaav kaa samarthan karne se hi inkaar kar diya tha
 He reportedly did this because the areas at the center of the application — the Shahjahanabad and Lutyens' Bungalow Zone — were not considered representative of Indian culture
 jaahir he ki is tarah ke kathan ko ab durlabh or betuka nahin mana jaataa
 On the same lines last year we also heard the statement of a minister of Uttar Pradesh that Taj Mahal is not really an example of Indian culture
 bhartiya kala ke bare main pehle jis kitaabi survey (1950 ke dashak main prakashit) ko maine ek chaatr ke rup main padhaa tha, usamen sindhu ghati sabhyataa se lekar san 1200 tak kii avadhi ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 The conclusion was that Indian civilization ended there and was replaced by someone else
 us kitaab ke baad ek or kitaab ai jisamen mughal sthapaty ko liya gaya tha lekin vah bhi 1750 ke baad aakar ruk gai
 Towards the end of the century, several surveys of Indian academics emerged which included modern art, and this was not done merely to identify the imperatives for linking the art of our times with the art of the past
 iske peeche to sirf bhartiya kala ke nirantar-vividh, nirantar parivartit hote charitra kaa jashn manaanaa hi makasad tha
 My guess for the year 2018 is that in public we will get to hear the ever-increasing regressive tone and the inevitable definition of Indian heritage, from the mouths of those who consider it necessary to improve the plurality of the past
 is tarah kii awaajon ko kam se kam virodh jhelana padegaa
 However my expectation for 2018 is that heritage experts will communicate with the ever-expanding scope of monuments and sites, regardless of their origin or date
 or loktantr kii mul bhaavana ke anuroop ve yah bhi seekhenge ki kaise aam logon ko saath lekar chalem

 Opposing the petition, Shahabuddin told the bench of Justice Deepak Mishra and Amitav Rai that such transfer from Siwan jail to Tihar is unfair and unjust
 aisa isliye ki yah kaidiyon ke sthanantaran kanoon 1950 ke khilaaf he
 He said that no law can be passed against the Transfer of Prisoners Act, 1950, because the prisoners are completely under the jurisdiction of the state government
 peeth ne kaha ki yachika main shahabuddin ko sivaan jail se tihaad jail sthanantarit karne ke liye sheersh adaalat ko anuchhed 142 ke tahat mili adhikaar kaa upyog karte hue sthanantarit karne kii maang kii gai he

 Three sons of Chandrakeshwar Prasad were murdered by alleged followers of Shahabuddin

 iske baad tushaar ne dheron filmon main apni kismat aajamaai lekin na to lead hero ke taur par wo kaamyaab hue or na said role ne unhen koi badi pahchaan dilaai
 But in the year 2006, he got a film through which he became increasingly famous
 ye film thi rohit shetty ke nirdesan main bani 'golmaal'
 In the film, Tusshar Kapoor played a character named Lucky who cannot speak but can listen
 tushaar ne is kirdaar ko kuch is andaaj main kiya ki isaki khub copy kii gai or shoj main jab bhi tushaar kii mimicri kerani hoti thi to unke isi kirdaar ko aamtaur par chunaa jaataa tha
 Born in Mumbai city in Maharashtra on 20 November 1976, while Tushar was seeking his place as an actor in Bollywood for a long time, his sister Ekta Kapoor became a well-known producer of small and big screen

 film menmhangaai ko lekar tata or birla ke naam kaa istemaalakia gaya he, jisase naaraaz hokar birla group ne film ke diarector prakaash jha ko notice bhej diya he
 There was a lot of uproar over the lyrics of the song, whether it was Birla or Tata, Ambani or Bata, everyone has cut the country in their affair
 
 
 ' gane par bavaal badhata ja rahaa he
 This song has embroiled 'chakravyuh' into a legal affair

 The Birla Group has sent a notice on the use of the name Birla in the song
 film se jude logon ko noticegane se jude jin paanch logon ke khilaaf birla group ne notice bheja he, wo hai film ke nirmaataa-nirdeshak prakaash jha, nirmaataa sunil lula, geetkaar eem turaj, sangeetkaar vijay verma or gayak kailash kher
 The Birla Group alleges that the song sounds as if the Birla Group has exploited the social and economic poor
 unka kahana he ki ye gaanaa kaarobaari gharaane ko badnaam karne kii koshish he
 Those who composed this song knew that it was a lie and would bring disrepute to the business family, but still deliberately released it with the wrong intentions
 nirmaataa-nirdeshak kii daleelein khaarijahaalanki film ke nirmaataa-nirdeshak prakaash jha daawa kar rahe hai ki ve to bas samaaj ke ek tabake kii soch saamne laa rahe hai
 The song of 'chakravyuh' was also stuck in the censor board, but Prakash Jha's pleas were saved by the censor scissors

 Accused of tarnishing the image, the business house claims that this song is tarnishing their image and will continue to do so

 Also, people associated with the song have been asked to apologize
 film ke nirmaataaon ne abtak maafeename kii sharten nahin maani he
 Currently, legal trails are being searched to get out of this Chakravyuh

 After this, a 6-inch wall is made on the door

 This process is kept completely secret

 For this, 14 tables are placed in the center according to each assembly constituency
 kitne samay lagata he ek round kii gananaa menharek teble par ek-ek iviem bheji jaati he
 Thus 14 evms are counted simultaneously for each Vidhan Sabha constituency

 Around the counting table are agents of parties or candidates who keep a close watch on the counting
 unke liye bhi matganana adhikari tay farm 17 si kaa antim hissaa bharwate hai

 In a recent poll, Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan was chosen as the best performer, but Amitabh Bachchan himself does not agree with this result

 Bachchan told reporters at a program of Parikrama Humanity Foundation on Saturday that i want to know who has done this survey? There is no truth in them
 is udyog main har abhinayta kii ek jagah he
 It is not fair to choose one better than the other
 69 varshiya abhinayta ne kaha ki vah nahin chaahate ki log unka anukaran karen lekin yadi ve phir bhi karnaa chaahate hai to ve samaybaddhata main unka anukaran karen
 He said that i do not think that there is too much in me to copy them
 mujhe har kisi se pyaar or sneh mil rahaa he or yah kaaphi he
 But if you want to hear anything from me, i would say that it should be my timeliness

 daagiyon ke chunaav ladane sambandhi adhyadesh par aaj baithkon kaa din he
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi met at 9:30 am
 25 minute tak chali baatcheet main rahul ne adhyadesh par apni naaraazgi se piem ko avgat karaayaa
 The Prime Minister has assured Rahul that he will put his concerns before the cabinet
 sutron ke mutabik, rahul ne pradhanmantri se kaha ki unhone sirf janabhaavana kaa khyaal rakhte hue adhyadesh kaa virodh kiya
 He also told the Prime Minister that his motive is not to hurt his heart
 iske baad adhyadesh par congress kor cameti kii baithak hui, jisamen pradhanmantri or sonia ke alaava grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia or ahamed patel shaamil the
 Finance Minister p Chidambaram and Defense Minister AK Antony could not attend the meeting due to personal reasons
 chidambaram srinagar main hai or antni aspataal main hai
 According to sources, the Congress is in favor of withdrawing the core group ordinance
 gauratlab he ki rahul ne adhyadesh par khuleam naaraazgi jataai thi
 The Prime Minister was in America at that time
 vah kal hi america se laute hai
 The Prime Minister will meet President Pranab Mukherjee at 12:30 pm
 abhi adhyadesh raashtrapati ke paas hi he
 According to sources, the President is unhappy with the ordinance
 iske baad shaam 6 baje cabinet kii baithak hogi, jiske baad adhyadesh waapas lene jaisaa koi bada faisla sambhav he
 Rahul Nirahul Gandhi had said the ordinance was rubbish and said that in his opinion this ordinance is completely rubbish and should be torn and thrown away
 iske turant baad congress ne bhi palati maarthe hue kaha tha ki rahul kii raay hi party kii raay he
 After this, BJP sought his resignation by linking it with the Prime Minister's self-respect
 haalanki pradhanmantri ne mangalvaar ko hi saaf kar diya ki vah istipha nahin denge
 What is different, Congress and Government: Since the statement of Rahul, there is an exercise to separate the Congress and the government on this issue
 beshak, rahul ke bayaan se siyaasi bhuuchaal machaa hua he lekin pradhanmantri kii baton se lagata he ki wo jaraa bhi vichlit nahin hai
 He says that in this meeting he will go to the bottom of Rahul's displeasure
 unhone yah bhi kaha, ‘kisi ke jahan ko badalanaa hameshaa mumkin hota he
 ' digital pulising kii mahatvakankshi yojana par teji se kaam kar rahi dilli police ne i-saathi skim kii shuruyaat kii he
 The benefit from this scheme will be that the public will avoid going around the police stations

 The only way for the Congress to get its candidate elected to the post of Vice President is to knock the door of the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal, which are supporting it from outside

 Unlike the presidential election, whose electorate consists of members of the state legislatures in addition to members of the Lok sabha-rajya Sabha, the Vice President is elected by members of both houses of parliament under the principle of proportional representation — through a single transferable vote, in which the electorate elects candidates Can choose based on priority list
 uparashtrapati rajyasabha kaa sabhapati bhi hota he
 Thus the total strength of a group of voters for the post of Vice President is 786 (lok Sabha 543, Rajya Sabha 243)
 chunaav jeetne ke liye uparashtrapati ke ummidavaar ko kam-se-kam 393 voton kii jarurat hoti he
 The upa's strength in the Lok Sabha is narrowly ahead of the halfway mark in the Lok Sabha, while it has little hope for the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, where the Congress and its coalition partners have a combined total of 106 members
 sansad ke donon sadanon ke sadasyon main upie kii kul sadsy sankhya 378 hoti he
 If the Trinamool Congress decides to spoil the arithmetic of the upa's election managers by deciding to support the opposition's candidate, then this number becomes even more fragile
 mamata banerjee kii party ke paas loksabhaa main 19 or rajyasabha main 9 sadsy hai
 In such a situation, UPA strategists have no choice but to gain the support of parties like SP, BSP, RJD and Lok Janashakti Party

 Vajpayee was not alone when the seeds of Hindu nationalist thinking were being sown as an alternative in the country
 hindu mahasabha ke purv netaa shyama prasad mukherjee ne jawaharlal nehru ke mantrimandal se istipha dekar jansangh kaa gathan kiya

 andolan ko aage badhaane ke liye vaajapeyi or laalkrishna adwani chunavi cheharaa bane
 The Jana Sangh was once merged with the Janata Party but then took the incarnation of the Bharatiya Janata Party, but it was difficult to recover from the untimely demise of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and Deendayal Upadhyay
 iske alaava deshmukh, joshi, thakare or bhandari jaise netaaon kii apni party ke daayre se baahar nihaayat hi simit apil thi
 At the same time, an ardent speaker, liberal nationalist and gentleman Vajpayee emerged

 The Hindu nationalist movement has got a new face in the form of Narendra Modi, but he will have to sweat a bit more to remove Vajpayee from Dewas or gain a bigger stature from him

 Earlier, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley introduced the Aadhaar bill in the Rajya Sabha
 bill pesh karte vakt vittamantri ne bataaya ki yah mani bill ke taur par pesh kiya gaya he, kyonki UIDAI ke tahat yah sirf vyakti kii pahchaan tak simit nahin he, balki sarkaar iske aadhaar par desh ke khazaane se nikalne vaale sabsidi ke paise ko sahi tareeke se kharch kar paaegi or sabsidi kaa faaydaa sahi logon tak pahunch paaegaa
 Arun Jaitley also said that the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is satisfied about this bill being a money bill and it cannot be challenged
 jetali ne kaha ki aadhaar number kaa vichaar upie ke daur main aayaa, jo ek acha vichaar he haalanki tab hamaare dal ke kai logon ne bhi is par aitaraaz jataae the, lekin jab nae vichaar aate hai to unka virodh bhi hota hi he
 Jaitley said that there is no reason for fear of breach of personal privacy under this bill
 iske tahat jo data he use rashtriya suraksha ke alaava kisi or chiz ke liye kisi bhi haal main saarvajanik nahin kiya jayega
 Jaitley said that if a person wants to share his identity on his own, he will be able to do it, but his core biometric data will not be shared even after his own approval

 Jaitley said that any decision in the court is not under consideration, that Parliament should lose its right to legislate on it
 arun jetali ne yah bhi kaha ki loksabhaa adhyaksh is bill ke mani bill hone ko lekar santusht hai or ise chunauti nahin di ja sakati
 Jaitley said that the idea of aadhaar number came in the era of UPA, which is a good idea, although many people of our party also objected to it, but when new ideas come, they are also opposed
 jetali ne kaha ki is bill ke tahat vyaktigat gopneeyata bhang hone kii jo ashanka jataai gai he uski koi vajah nahin he
 The data under it will not be made public for anything other than national security
 jetali ne kaha ki koi vyakti khud apni marzi se agar apni pahchaan saajha karnaa chahta he to kar paaegaa lekin uskaa kor biomitric data uski khud kii manzuri ke baad bhi saajha nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 The comments rashtriya suraksha ke maamalon main jaankaree saajha karne kaa faisla ek athurity karegi jiskaa mukhiya sarkaar main varisht str kaa ek afasar hoga or uske faislon kii samiksha cabinet secretary kii adhyakshata main bani cameti karegi
 Arun Jaitley also dismissed the objection of CPM MP Sitaram Yechury, stating that the issue is under consideration in the Supreme Court and hence it cannot be debated in Parliament
 jetali ne kaha ki court main kisi faisle ke vichaaradhin hone kaa matlab yah nahin he ki sansad us par kaanoon banane kaa apana haq kho den
