 input - ieenes After failing to perform as expected in the Lok Sabha elections, differences have now emerged in the top leadership of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 varisht netaa yogendra yadav ne aap ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal par nishaanaa saadhaa he to party ne shajia ilmi ko waapas laane kaa prayaas shuru kar diya he
 The leadership of the party faced criticism at the National Executive meeting of AAP
 party main matbhed yogendra yadav or manish sisodiya ke bich hue patr vyavhaar ke baad khulkar saamne aa gaya
 Kejriwal's close aide Manish Sisodia accused Yadav of targeting Kejriwal and making public internal affairs
 shuukravaar ko yogendra yadav or kejariwal ne is mudde par kuch bhi bolne se inkaar kar diya
 The party, while trying not to pay attention to the issue, said that different opinions are not a crime and this reflects democracy in the party
 'aap' ke netaa sanjay singh ne kaha, 'is mudde par charchaa nahin kii gai
 Party people can match each other
 yah ek loktantric prakriya he or yah party ke aantarik loktantr ko pradarshit karata he
 Yogendra Yadav, in a letter to the party's Political Affairs Committee (PAC), said, "there is a widespread perception among activists and well-wishers that the party is beset by a disease of person worship, which has also engulfed other parties in the country
" ' party ke netaa naveen jaihind se matbhed ke baad yadav ne pichley dinon piesi se istipha de diya tha
 He has also given the reason for his resignation in the letter
 yadav ne kaha, 'party ke bade faislon main ek vyakti kii ichha jhalkati he
 The party changes its footsteps when it changes its mind
 netaa se kareeb hona sanghathanaatmak bhoomikaayen or jimmedaariyaan kaa aadhaar he
 'he said,' When all the decisions and successes are credited to one person, then all the charges will also go to the same person
 'yadav ne kaha, 'isamen koi andeh nahin ki arvind bhai party main nirvivaadit netaa hai
 But there is a difference between a leader and a supremo
 netaa ke prati sneh or aaksharn aksar vyakti puja main tabdeel ho jaataa he jisase sanghathan or netaa donon ko nuksaan hota he
 This seems to be happening in our party
 ' Differences in the BJP still remain on the issue of inclusion of 'caste in the census'
 party kaa ek tabaka janaganana main jati ko shaamil karne kaa pakshdhar he jabaki anya netaa mahasoos karte hai ki ise obisi, essi yaa asti varg ke tahat shaamil karnaa chahie
 a senior BJP leader said that if caste is to be included in the census, there should be a separate column for it so that caste can be clearly written in it
 sutron kaa kahana he ki yah sangh parivaar ke manmutabik hona chahie jo ab tak janaganana main jati ko shaamil kiye jane kaa virodh karata rahaa he kyonki yah ek akhand raashtra kii rashtravaadi vichaardhaara ke khilaaf he

 Agra, situated about 200 km from the national capital, on the banks of the Yamuna River, may be a centuries-old city, but with urbanization in the country, the city is reaching its limits
 yamuna express-ve se shahar kii ore jane par ekbargi aisa lagata he ki shahar ke paas failane ke liye paryaapt jameen he lekin jameen kii keemton ke aasmaan chune kii vajah se is puraane shahar ke nae ilaakon ke kshitij par bahumanjili imaaraten ubhar rahi hai
 Regarding this vertical growth of the city, Pushpanjali Hospital and Research Center and Pushpanjali Construction Pvt

 agarwal kaa kehete hai, ''isaki kai vajahen hai
 One, land acquisition is not easy
 duusari, jameen kii kami he
 Due to this, land has become very expensive in the last three-four years
 in sabase badhkar har vyakti shahar main rahanaa chahta he, vahaan kii sukh-suvidhaon kaa laabh uthaanaa chahta he
 ‚Äúdue to lack of land, multi-storey residential and commercial buildings have become popular
 lekin shahar main nirmaan sambandhi niyamon main ab bhi khaas badlaav nahin aayaa he
 a number of conditions have to be followed for the construction of multi-storey buildings, with approval from a dozen departments including the fire brigade
 agra main agnishman vibhaag ke paas paanch manzil se oonchi imaaraton main aag ko bujhane ke liye koi intjaam nahin he
 "the fire hydrants in the city are almost non-existent, due to which firefighters of the fire department have faced water shortage during several incidents," says Agra Superintendent of Police Subhash Dubey
 ‚Äù haalanki duusare shaharon kii tarah yahaan bhi floor aria resho (ekher) kii vyavastha he
 Because of this most residential buildings do not reach above five floors
 agra ke pramukh vyavsaayik centre sanjay place main aath manjila imaaraten hai
 But the Agra Development Authority (ADA) on Fatehabad Road, ADA Heights and Pushpanjali Constructions have created a new standard of height for buildings in the city by creating wreath heights
 in donon jagahon par imaaraton kii oonchai 14 manzil he
 While ADA Heights is located on the Fatehabad Road, one of the most expensive areas of Agra, Pushpanjali Heights is located on the banks of the Yamuna in Dayalbagh, on the city limits
 edie ke sachiv ravindra gupta kaa kahana he, ''edie hits kii khaasiyat he ki yahaan kii khidakiyon se vishwa prasiddh imaarat taj mahal kaa didaar hota he, jis vajah se yahaan bane saare apartment hathohath bik gaye
 Even the two top penthouses were booked on the first day
 ‚Äù haalanki isamen flats book karaane vaale kuch logon kaa kahana he ki sabhi khidakiyon se taj mahal nahin dikhataa
 Significantly, these tall buildings are being built on the outskirts of the city
 shahar ke kolahal se dur ashiana banane kii isi chahat ko bhunaane ke liye agra main kai builder apni pariyojna par kaam kar rahe hai
 Apart from ADA, big names like Ansal and Jaypee Group are included
 inamen se kuch builder township basaa rahe hai
 Santosh Katara, director of the Nalanda Group, says, "there were plans to build multi-storeyed buildings in Agra, but there are many restrictions due to being an Air Force base, so work on the eight-story buildings ‚Äî Nalanda Crown and Nalanda Heights - is underway right now is
 ‚Äù gaur talab he ki hawaii adde se do mile kii paridhi main kisi oonchi imaarat kaa nirmaan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 By the way, the group has established a 14-storeyed township called Sanskar City in Vrindavan, just 60 km from Agra

 He is now planning to construct Shastriapuram Heights on Mathura Road
 isamen 17 manjila imaaraten hongi
 Most of the multi-storeyed buildings in Agra are located either in the triangular areas of Fatehabad and Shamsabad route, or on the Dayalbagh and agra-mathura highway
 in sabhi ilaakon main nayaa nirmaan ho rahaa he or jameen kii keemat ke khaasi oonchi hone ke kaaran builder bahumanjila imaaraton par adhik jor de rahe hai
 The sad aspect associated with these highs is that the city lacks infrastructure and resources
 saamaajik kaaryakarta vishaal sharma kaa kahana he, ''ground water kaa level har saal ek meter se neeche ja rahaa he, or abhi tak shahar main pani kii supplaai kaa pukhta intjaam nahin kiya gaya he
 "kishore Jain of Jain Electricals, who is contracting electrical wires and fittings in new buildings, says," Most of the investors in these buildings are booking
 ‚Äùisaki pramukh vajah ek hi jagah par sabhi suvidhaayen uplabdh hona he
 Where vehicle parking is also a problem in the old city, all these buildings have under-ground parking
 suraksha ke lihaaj se bhi log bahumanjili imaaraton main rahanaa pasand kar rahe hai or ek sammilit imaarat main rahane se rakrakhaav kaa kharch bhi kam aa rahaa he
 Also, they are getting cheaper due to taking all facilities including electricity, water, cable TV etc
 shahar ke khaskar ucch varg ke log bhi dhire-dhire badi aaleeshaan kothiyon se hatakar suraksha ke lihaaj se mahfuj in imaaraton main ja rahe hai
 Murarilal Agarwal, the owner of Manish Prakashan, lived in the posh Kothi of Vijayanagar, a posh area of the city
 lekin ab ve aashirwad residency ke echiji apartment main rah rahe hai
 According to him, "there is safety and good environment here
" ‚Äùimaaraton kii bulandi agra ke liye koi nai baat nahin he
 But now, due to the scarcity of land and all the amenities of the city at one place, the vertical growth of Agra is fixed like other cities

 He is the biggest culprit of the Mumbai attack and he is also the partner of jaish-e-mohammed in the attack on Parliament
 saikadon logon ko maut ke ghat utaarne vaala hafiz said kah rahaa he ki use aatankwaadi naa kaha jaae
 Would you believe that Hafiz Saeed filed a petition in the United Nations asking that his name be removed from the list of terrorists
 hafiz said kaa jhooth- wo aatanki nahibataaiye, aisa bhi kahin hota he ki kya, jisane aatank kii paathshaala shuru kii ho
 Who has made the people of the city cry tears of blood
 jisane saikadon logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya ho
 Who created an organization like lashkar-e-tayyaba
 vahi kahe ki meraa naam aatankiyon kii list se baahar nikaal do
 Because i am not a terrorist
 abaatanki hafiz saidka isse bada jhooth or kya hoga
 Hafizji is an internationally designated terrorist
 ye arji usee hafiz said kii taraf se he, jo 'internationali designated tebrist' he
 Which has a $ 10 million bounty on its head
 jo lashkar-e-taiyaba jaise aatanki sanghathan kaa sansthaapak he
 Joe Hafiz Saeed is the mastermind of the Mumbai attack
 jiske haath saikadon begunaahon ke koon se range hai
 Which is the largest supplier of 'terror' in Kashmir
 jo khud apane hi desh main nazarband rahaa he
 To remove the name from the terrorist list, Arjivo is trying to declare himself as Sharif
 bharat main jamaat-ud-daawa ke is most wonted aatanki hafiz ne sanyukt raashtra main arji lagaai he ki use aatankwaadi na kaha jaae or uskaa naam aatankiyon kii list se hataa diya jaae
 For this, he has filed a petition in the United Nations
 reports ke mutabik hafiz kii taraf se ye arji lahore kii ek lau form mirza and mirza ne yuan main daayar kii he
 This application was filed only when Hafiz Saeed was under house arrest in his own house in Lahore
 lahore kii lau form ne lagaai yachikapakistan ke neshnal acountibility beuro main purv prosicuter general navid rasul mirza ne hafiz said ke yuan main yachika lagane kii baat kii pushti kii he
 Naveed's son Hyder Rasul Mirza is Hafiz's lawyer at the UN
 vahaan daayar uyachika main lahore kii mirza and mirza lau form ne kaha "ham hafiz mohammad said kii taraf se pitishan daayar kar rahe hai
 We want Hafiz's name removed from the list of factions associated with ISIS and Al Qaeda
 ye list yuan sicurity council or al kaayda sanctions cameti ne taiyaar kii he
 "the United Nations had declared terrorists
 Let me tell you that the United Nations in front of which Hafiz Saeed has expressed reservations about calling himself a terrorist
" use khud usee sanghathan ne 9 saal pehle disambar 2008 main aatanki ghoshit kiya tha
 While the US had already called him a Global Terrorist before the Mumbai attacks and placed a $ 10 million reward on his head
 yahaan tak kii use uske hi desh main anti terarrism act ke tahat 11 maheene tak nazarband rakhaa gaya
 Yes, it is different that due to the negligence of the government, the court released him only last week
 bematlab he hafiz kii arjyab sawaal ye he ki hafiz said ne jo yachika yuan main di he uskaa matlab kuya he? 2008 main jab suraksha parishad kii prastaav sankhya 1267 ke tahat hafiz ko aatanki ghoshit kiya gaya tha, to us vakt china ne sahmati di thi
 In such a situation, it is not possible that China can help Pakistan or Hafiz Saeed
 iske alaava hafiz ne vyaktigat taur par ye arji daayar kii he
 No such application has been filed by the Government of Pakistan at present
 lihaaja hafiz kii koshish ke koi myne nahin hai
 America expressed resentment on the international stage, India is strongly speaking against terrorism
 iskaa asar ye he ki duniya ke wo desh jo aatankwaad kii samasya ko bharat or pakistan ke bich kaa aapasi maamla maanate the, wo bhi ab ye maan rahe hai ki aatankiyon ke kai chehre hai, jo duniya ko asthir kar rahe hai
 The US has already objected to the Pakistani government over Hafiz's release
 aise main lagata nahin he ki jo khyaali pilav miyaan hafiz said pakistan main baithe-baithe pakaane kii koshish main laga he, wo kabhi pakegi

 The latest effort of Delhi government to reduce pollution is also similar

 Some people have welcomed this decision and some have described it as impractical
 philhal bahes chhidi he kiyah faisla kitna sahihai or yah lagu bhi ho paaegaa yaa nahin
 But there is also a question under this debate - does Delhi need a car or health? Although it is for Delhi to decide, it is important to consider some figures before reaching any conclusion

 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat has said that every Indian living in the country is a Hindu
 ise dharm se jodakar nahin balki jivan style ke nazariye se dekhnaa chahie
 Bhagwat said this while interacting with 70-plus foreign journalists from 30 countries on various issues at the Ambedkar International Center in Delhi
 videshi patrakaron se baatcheet ko lekar sangh kaa kahana he ki aresas ke khilaaf desh or duniyaan main kai tarah kii bhrantiyaan he
 Therefore, the Sangh is trying to make people around the world understand the Sangh in the true sense
 iske liye samvaad hi ekmaatr rasta he
 We can understand each other better only by talking among ourselves

 Describing mall lynching as disgusting, Bhagwat said that the Sangh is against any kind of violence
 yadi sangh kaa bhi koi swayan sevak is ghrunit kaary main sanlipt he to use kanoon ke mutabik sajaa milani chahie
 In response to a question about Kashmir, Bhagwat said that the Sangh has always been in favor of a country and a legislation
 isliye anuchhed 370 ko nishprabhavi karne kaa sangh samarthan karata he
 Now the next question is that should the situation in Kashmir return to normal as soon as possible
 jo asli sawaal he ki vahaan ke logon main yah bharosa ho ki unke jo sawaal hai uskaa udaar hriday se samdhaan ho
 Especially the apprehension about their citizenship or the land there, should be removed
 enarasi ko lekar bhagwat ne spasht vichaar rakhe
 He said that he is a supporter of NRC
 yah mahaj apane nagarikon ko chinhit karne kaa tarika he
 If a Hindu is displaced in any country of the world, then India is the only country where he will get shelter
 bhagwat ne yah bhi saaf kiya ki raajnneeti main yaa sarkaar main sangh koi dakhal nahin rakhata he
 It is different that many people of Sangh ideology are in politics and government
 lekin sangh, sarkaar or raajnneetik dal alag-alag hai

 ab gaiyr-metro shaharon kii prishthbhumi ko lekar filmein ban rahi hai
 In sports like cricket and shooting ‚Äî which were earlier considered elite due to the presence of children in most public schools ‚Äî now the boys and girls of small towns dominate
 seva udyog ke kaarybal kaa bada hissaa inhen bhitari ilaakon ke bashindon ke bich se aa rahaa he
 Not surprisingly, all the 'gahmagahmi' of sexserve are also seen in places which till recently were considered small cities or towns and are now on the verge of becoming big cities and metros
 sambandhonko lekar najariya badal rahaa he
 So what is it that is giving such unbridled sex to boys and girls in cities like Chandigarh, Pune, Guwahati and Indore? Anonymity seems to be the biggest reason that heralds this type of revolution
 pune yaa indore kii chuppi kaa mukhya sabab yah tha ki yahaan har koi har kisi ko jaanata tha
 In the last decade, new age businesses, banks, call centers, hotels and malls have come out in these small cities and due to this large population of even more small towns that have grown on their diet have settled in these small cities
 misaal ke liye, indore ke crystal ity park main kaam karne waalon kaa bada hissaa ratlam, khandwa, khargun, devas or dhar sareekhe kasbon kaa he
 These boys and girls become mere faces as soon as they come to Indore, not even the neighbors who know them are aware of them and the families around them either do not exist or there are very few
 natijatan sankeernata or roodhiyon ke lokachar peeche chhot jate hai or yon aazaadee milti he
 Two decades ago, women in Indore could hardly see the back seat of a bike
 aaj shahar ke bahari awasaiya ilaakon main liv-in rishte koi asamanya baat nahin rah gai he
 Along with this, due to the emergence of new age businesses, there has been a flood of private institutions of higher education in such cities
 misaal ke liye, indore main hi takreeban 100 ejineering college hai or saath hi medical collejon, nursig collejon or gaiyr-peshewar course kii peshkash karne vaale collejon kii bahaar aa gai he
 Most of the students of these colleges are also from outside
 gumnami unhen ek aisi jeevanstyli apnaane kii aazaadee detii he, jisamen kisi poochtacha kii ijaajat nahin he
 Many people coming to these cities, especially girls, come from or come from conservative families
 jis shahar main ve pehle padhai or phir kaam ke liye aa basate hai, vah unhen yon lihaaj se bhi phalne-phoolne kaa aadhaar detaa he
 The incidence of retrenchment has increased in recent times in sectors like banking and insurance
 kaam karne kii jagah par yah asuraksha bhaavana kaiyon ko daftar main zyada majbootee se jame bos yaa saathiyon ke saath yon rishton kii taraf dhakelti he
 Says a builder from Indore, "the younger generation wants to live a faster life and is not afraid to die at a young age
 jindagi main tajurbe jutanaa behad jaruri he or inamen yon tajurbe shaamil hai
 What is surprising then is that behind the national law of averages, there are cities scattered all over the country with the most sexually active white-collar workforce
 survey main shaamil desh bhar ke 44 fisadi log apane saathiyon ke saath yon rishte ko thik bataate hai, magar survey kahata he ki yah taadaad pune (70%'), indore (67%), hyderabad (57%), kochi (56%) or chandigarh (55%) main isse bahut zyada he, jo banisbatan chote shaharon main kaarysthalon par yon rishton kii sweekruti kii taraf ishaara karata he
 These cities are also honest about what they are doing
 pune or lakhanu main kramshah 56 or 59 fisadi uttardaataaon ne kaha ki unhone apane saathiyon ko yon rishte kii peshkash kii thi
 This is much higher than the all India average of 28 per cent
 jahaan tak un logon kii baat he jinase ye peshkash kii gai thim, pune ne 59 fisadi ghatnaayen darj kin, jo 34 fisadi ke rashtriya ausat se bahut zyada he
 a total of 49 per cent of men responded that they were tempted to have an affair at the workplace, while the number of women who accepted it was estimated at 34 per cent
 lekin desh bhar ke shaharon main aisa nahin tha‚Äîhyderabad ke 69 fisadi, pune ke 60 fisadi or lakhanu ke 59 fisadi uttardaataaon ne is sawaal ke jawaab main 'haa' kaha
 Nationally, 28 per cent claimed to have had sex with their partner, while the number of such confessors was significantly higher in Pune with 47 per cent followed by Chennai and Lucknow with 46 per cent
 jab apane maatahaton ke saath sex kii baat aati he, to lakhanu main aisa karne waalon kii taadaad rashtriya ausat se kahin zyada he
 Lucknow and Pune accounted for 48 per cent and 44 per cent of those who accept this type of relationship, while 29 per cent of people accepted it at the all-india level
 guwahati main 93 fisadi uttardaataaon ne daawa kiya ki unhone apane maatahaton ke saath sex kiya tha, vahiin rashtriya str par aisa rishta kaayam karne vaali mahilaon kii taadaad 45 fisadi or purushon kii 56 fisadi he
 Hyderabadi (72%) are among the top cooks who have sex with their peers, which is higher than Chennai (65%) and Gurugram (59%) and much higher than the national average of 43%
 pune ke bascindia 'sexting' yani yon sandesh bhejne waalon main sabase zyada (55%) the, jabaki iskaa rashtriya ausat mahaj 28 fisadi hi tha
 Kiss and Tell means sexual intercourse seems normal
 rashtriya str par jitne logon kii raay lee gai, unamem se aadhon ne kaha ki ve ek aise shaks ko jaanate the jiske apane saathi karmi ke saath yon rishte the
 But in Lucknow, the number of such people was again high, where 65% of the respondents claimed that they knew
 chandigarh ke aankade bhi isi se milte-julate the
 Delhi topped the workplace with the highest incidence of sexual harassment (59%)
 haalanki pune (55%), lakhanu (52%) or guwahati (42%) sareekhe chote shahar bhi zyada peeche nahin hai
 In small towns, however, there may also be a lack of awareness about what sexual harassment is
 indore ke hotel main kaam karne vaali ek mahila karmchaaree kahati hai, ''kaarysthal par gaali kaa istemaal, mahila saathiyon ke kapadon par tikaa-tippanee or sharir ko lekar unhen sharmasaar karnaa purush saathiyon ke liye aam baat he
 They may not realize that it is sexual harassment
 
 
 yaa shaayad ve ise lekar besharm hon
 "sex at the workplace, apart from fun, seems to do wonders for career as well
" rashtriya str par aadhe se zyada (51%) uttardaataaon ne kaha ki kaarysthal par sex kaa unke kariyar par acha asar padaa he
 In Ahmedabad, 100 per cent of the respondents said that it boosted their career, 98 per cent in Guwahati and 74 per cent in Lucknow claimed the same
 utpaadakta ke lihaaj se raishumaari main shaamil 55 fisadi logon ne kaha ki sex kaa acha asar padaa he, jabaki 26 fisadi ko koi asar dikhaai nahin diya
 In this case also, Ahmedabad is the top with 100 percent approval

 itani hi taadaad main pune ke uttardaataaon ko bhi aise maamalon kaa pataa tha
 At the all-india level, only 43 percent of people are aware of such cases
 daftar ke vakt ke dauraan sex gatividhiyon vaala guwahati ek or maamle main bhi sabase khulaa shahar maaloom detaa he
 91 per cent of the respondents here do not mind telling HR about sexual partners, whereas in Ahmedabad and Ranchi, not a single respondent wants to share such information
 rashtriya str par 29 fisadi uttardaata kaarysthal par yon harkaton ke bare main echaar ko bataane ke liye taiyaar the
 At the all-india level, 51 percent of respondents said they had sex with the same partner

 In contrast, 43 per cent of respondents in Ahmedabad claimed sex with three partners

 *** deepawali par pataakhe chhodane ke shaukeen rajdhani vaasiyon ke liye acchhee khabar he ki supreme court ne pataakhon par purna pratibandh hataa diya he
 The Supreme Court has overturned its own earlier order of complete ban and has allowed the sale of firecrackers, but has also imposed several conditions
 supreme court ne rakhin ye sharten, die ye nirdesh -:- dilli main pataakhon kii bikri ke liye die jane vaale license aadhe kiye jaaen or adhiktam 500 license jari kiye jaaen
 This time the number will be half the number of licenses issued in 2016
 iskaa matlab saaf he kikewal 500 dukaanon par hi pataakhen bikenge
 - The same rules will also be applicable for NCR
 yani 2016 kii apeksha ensiaar ke liye bhi license kii sankhya aadhi hogi
 - No firecrackers should be left within 100 meters of the silent zone
 yani hospital, court, dharmik sthal or skool ke aasapaas 100 meter kaa dayera silens jone hoga
 Lithium, lead, mercury, antimony and arsenic will not be used in making crackers
 - dilli-ensiaar main duusare rajyon se agle aadesh tak pataakhe nahin laae jaaenge, kyonki dilli-ensiaar main pehle se hi pataakhe kaa stock maujuud he
 Stocks of 50 lakh kg of firecrackers in delhi-ncr are more than adequate for the upcoming Dussehra and Deepawali
 license praapt dukandaar puraane stock main bache pataakhe bech sakate hai yaa duusare rajyon main supplai bhi kar sakate hai
 The Supreme Court, while lifting the ban on firecrackers' license, also made it clear that after Diwali, the court will hear the air quality

 He called for fierce competition in the difficult situation
 tiwari ne 2010 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaavon kaa udhaaharan diya jab congress ko chaar siten hi mili thim or unhen 20 se bhi zyada news channelon par sawaalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Asked how the bjp's attacks on the 1984 anti-sikh riots would be countered, the minister said that the Congress leadership, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and party president Sonia Gandhi, has apologized several times to this 'condemnable' incident
 
 samajha jaataa he ki tiwari ne kaha, 'lekin 2002 ke gujarat dangon ko lekar aapane unki ore se koi maafee nahin suni hogi

 rajbhar mukhyamantri yogi adityanath par nishaanaa sadhate hai or dipti siem keshav prasad maury kii shaan main kaside padhate hai
 In such a situation, the question arises whether everything is not going well in the UP BJP? On the defeat of BJP in Kairana and Noorpur elections, Rajbhar said on Sunday, 'raja always has responsibility for any defeat
 2017 kaa vidhansabha chunaavakeshav prasad mauryake netritv main ladaa gaya tha
 During that time, all backward castes including Saini, Kushwaha, Maurya voted for BJP to make Keshav Prasad Maurya the CM, but became CM Yogi, due to which the government is facing the backward resentment

 He has been continuously commenting against CM Yogi for the last 6 months

 Neither the BJP nor any Keshav Maurya has commented on such statements by the leader of the ally
 jabaki rajbhar lagaataar keshav ke paksh main bayaan de rahe hai or yogi par sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 Last month, State President Mahendra Nath Pandey warned against the rhetoric being leveled against the party continuously across Rajbhar, that he should not make unrestrained rhetoric every day or else strict action would be taken against him

 Talking to reporters here, Mayawati said that the manner in which the BJP created a one-sided wind across the country yesterday through the media regarding Narendra Modi's nomination and road show
 nirvachan ayog ko chahie ki vah iskaa swat: sangyaan len
 He said that Narendra Modi's road show in Varanasi was not in public interest
 uske khilaaf sakht kadam uthaae jane chahie
 Mayawati said that in Varanasi yesterday there was a lot of wrong publicity about Narendra Modi's roadshow, while the reality is that there were more local outsiders in the roadshow
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki media ke jariye bhaajapa ne modi ke road sho ko kaaphi badha chadhaakar prachaarit karaayaa, jisase agle charnon ke matdaan main vishesh rup se purvanchal main bhaajapa ko zyada se zyada laabh mil sake, jabaki aisa nahin hoga
 Mayawati also said that it is also discussed that through the media, a lot of money is being spent by the capitalists and industrial houses to create electoral wind by BJP, Congress and SP
 mayawati ne aarope lagaaya ki bhaajapa ke samarthan main puunjipatiyon kii madad se media ke jariye jabardasti hawa banane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Taking a dig at the opposition parties, he alleged that if they come to power, they will make policies for the benefit of their supportive capitalists, so people should vote very thoughtfully, otherwise the country will fall behind
 basapa adhyaksh ne kaha ki pradesh main teen charnon kaa matdaan baaki he or samaajawaadee party (sapa) tathaa bhaajapa ise hindu-muslim rang dene kii koshish kar sakati hai
 He said, 'I urge the Election Commission to pay special attention to the security of not only Varanasi but all temples and mosques in Purvanchal
 in dharmasthalon kii hifaazat kii jimmedaari rajya police ke haathon main nahin, balki kendriya balon ke hawaale honi chahie
 If there is any action in Varanasi, it will affect the entire country
 ' Mayawati said that the Congress is contesting the election of its Prime Ministerial candidate, undeclared Rahul Gandhi, while the BJP is putting forward its declared candidate Modi
 modi ko agar uttar pradesh se chunaav ladanaa hi tha to unhen rahul ke khilaaf ladanaa chahie tha
 Nothing has been clear yet about whether Prashant Kishore (prashant Kishor) will work with Mamata Banerjee to win the TMC in the West Bengal Assembly elections

 lekin agar bhavishya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue centre or bihar sarkaar saath milakar kaam kar rahi he
 Regarding the assembly elections in Bihar, Nitish Kumar said that JDU-BJP will fight together in next year's assembly elections
 is par koi sawaal khadaa karnaa galat hoga
 Nitish Kumar was addressing a press conference in Patna
 is dauraan jab patrakaron ne unase poocha ki kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil na karne par aapaki raay he to unhone kaha ki jo sankethik pratinidhitiv ke aadhaar par ek mantri shaamil kiye jane kaa ofar diya gaya tha uskaa koi matlab nahin tha
 There is no need for that
 nitish ne kaha ki jo hona hota he wo prarambh main hota he
 He said that the people have given themselves the mandate to run the government, so what is the need of the allies in it

 For financial prosperity, put a picture of Lakshmi ji sitting at the place of worship
 - santan kii prapti ke liye camel ke phool kaa chitra yaa gaay kaa chitra shayan kaksh main lagaaein
 - For good health, place a picture of the rising sun at the place of work

 Whatever the game is, the only thing that matters is the Sportsman spirit
 yahi to ek baat he jo ek baar aapane sikh lee to phir jindagi ke maidan main baaji maarane se aapako koi nahin roak saktaa
 Learn 5 lessons that sports teach us in sports
 1
 Learning from defeat: The greatest thing that sports teaches you is to learn from your defeat, fall down and rise again with a new energy
 khel koi bhi hokhiladi apane best shotke liye har haal main bas kar gujarata he, is baat se bephikr hokar kii nateeja kya hoga
 2
 team work magic:khel koi bhi ho wo aapako team ke saath kaise kaam karnaa he or ek acchhee team kaise banati he
 Teaches this thing well
 ek-duusare ke saath kaise maahaul ko healdi banaae rakhana he aap sikh jate hai, jo jindagi main lambii pari khilne main kaam aata he
 3
 khud ko doosraa mauka dena:jindagi main galtiyaan hone ke baad ham sochate hai ab sab khatm
 We do not think that by giving yourself another chance, see if new paths are waiting for you
 vahiin sports pehle din se yahi sikhta he ki hameshaa khud ko doosraa mauka do
 If the first shot goes bad, will the second hit
 4
 Set your own limit: How much you are capable of, usually we decide with the thinking of others
 itnaa hi nahin use pathar kii lakeer maanakar apni kshamtaaon ko bhul jate hai
 At the same time, the game gives you a new challenge everyday and teaches you how much your ability is, you set it and can increase it every day
 5
 Handling yourself in defeat: Every day you win it cannot happen

 There is resentment in Sitamarhi saint society with the statement given by Union Minister Mahesh Sharma regarding Sitamarhi
 sant samaaj ne mantri se apane bayaan par maafee maangane ko kaha nahin to dushprinaam kii chetavanee di he
 Mata Sita has a visible site in Sitamarhi, Bihar
 sadiyon se ye manyata chali aa rahi he ki mithila ke raja janak ne bhayankar sookhe chapet main aae rajya main varsha ke liye jab hal chalaaya to sitamarhi ke nikat punaura dharti se mata sita kaa janm hua
 It is also discussed in Valmiki Ramayana that Mata Sita was born in Mithila
 lekin kendriya mantri mahesh sharma ne rajyasabha main jo jawaab diya usase puraa sant samaaj andolit ho uthaa he
 Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma said in Rajya Sabha that Sitamarhi is just a center of faith and trust
 bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan ne vahaan aisa koi pramaan nahin paaya he jisaki vajah se sitamarhi ko sita kii janmasthali mana jaae
 Mahesh Sharma was answering the question of Prabhat Jha, BJP MP from Madhya Pradesh
 prabhaat jha sitamarhi ke mul nivasee he
 This statement of the Union Minister has evoked strong reaction not only in Sitamarhi but in Janakpur in Nepal
 sitamarhi ke sant samaaj ne to andolan kii chetavanee di he
 He demands that the minister apologize for his statement
 iske liye sant samaaj kii shuukravaar ko sitamarhi ke janaki mandir main ek apaat baithak yojit kii gai
 The saints involved in the meeting questioned the minister's spiritual knowledge and also questioned his mental state
 mandir ke pujari triloki das ne kaha ki sitamarhi main treyata yug main mata sita ke janm kaa pramaan he, jab rakshason ke atyaachaar se 12 varshon tak bhayanak sookhe ke baad raja janak ke dwaara hal jotane ke dauraan santon ke rakt se bhare ghade se mata sita prakat hui
 In such a situation, the minister who questions Sita's birth believes Ram, and not Sita? It is strongly opposed by the Sant Samadhi of Sitamarhi and the Minister should apologize without any delay, not only that, the site of Sita's place of worship was named Sitamarhi on the call of Narada Muni
 iske pramaan puranic granthon main bhi he
 Mahesh Sharma is a BJP MP
 unki party ayodhya ko ram kii janm bhoomi maanati he par sita kii janmasthali par sawaal khadaa kiya ja rahaa he
 However, it is true that the birth of Shri Rama in Ayodhya has been proved by the Department of Archeology
 lekin sita mata kii janmasthali ke liye us str par shodh nahin kiya gaya to phir pramanikta kaa kya sawaal he
 It is definitely discussed in mythological texts
 or sabase badi baat agar sitamarhi main mata sita kaa janm nahin hua he to phir nepal main sthit janakapur kii kya pramanikta he
 Whereas the land lying off the Ganges in the Mithila state at that time has been considered as the boundary of Mithila
 saath hi sarayu nadi se lage kshetron me ramayana kaal kii hui ghatnaon kaa zikr he
 Be it Ahilya place, Punaura Dham, Haleshwar place cult, Dhanusha and Janakpur are all connected to each other
 puranic granthon main isaki charchaa he ki sookhe se jal rahi dharti par varsha karaane ke aahwan ke saath raja janak ne janakapur se kuch duri par hal chalaaya tha
 The distance from Sitamarhi to Punauradham to Janakpur is not very much
 har saal vivaah panchami ke avasar par ayodhya se shriram kii baraat janakapur jaataa he
 So is this event going on for centuries without any proof
 jin dharmagranthon main ram ayodhya janakapur or lanka kaa zikr he unheen main sita or unki janmabhumi mithila kaa bhi zikr he
 Sitamarhi is considered to be the birthplace of Mother Sita from the same scriptures
 aarthik muddon par aresas se jude bhartiya majdoor sangh or modi sarkaar ke mantriyon ke bich mangalvaar shaam ko hui baatcheet benatija rahi
 The government is looking positive on many demands but there are still many issues on which there is a deadlock
 kai muddon par gatirodh jarivitt mantri arun jetali ke saath sarkaar ke chaar varisht mantriyon ne bmes ke saath shaam 6 baje se lekar raat 9 baje tak kareeb teen ghante tak chali maathapai main sarkaar ne bmes kii sabhi maangon par sakaaratmak rukh dikhaaya
 However, many issues related to minimum wages, bonuses, contract wages, social security to unorganized sector workers, protection of the interests of Anganwadi workers could not come out with a common formula between the government and BMS
 sarkaar ne maanga or vaktasarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye or zyada vakt maange jane kii baat bmes netaaon ne maan lee
 However, BMS refused to withdraw the proposal for a nationwide strike on 2 September without consent and notification being issued
 sarkaar or bmes ke bich ab duusare daur kii baatcheet 22 agast ko dilli main hogi
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was accompanied by Labor Minister Bandaru Dattatreya, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Energy Minister Piyush Goyal in the meeting held in the Ministry of Finance
 bmes kii ore se rashtriya adhyaksh baijnath raay, mahaamantri virajesh upaadhyaay, sanyukt mantri bi surendran, purv adhyaksh sajinarayan, kendriya mantri pawan kumaar ne baithak main hissaa liya
 In relation to the minimum wage, Pechrun Jaitley accepted the demand of BMS in principle that the minimum wage of the workers should be fixed afresh on the same formula across the country, on the other hand, BMS also theoretically accepted that many The government's proposal for a change in decade-old labor laws is justified
 zyaadaatar maangen maanane ko taiyaar sarkaarhalanki, bmes ne ye bhi saaf kiya ki shram kanoonon main koi bhi badlaav bagaiyr majdoor sanghathanon se charchaa ke nahin kiye jane chahie
 BMS General Secretary Virjesh Upadhyay told Aaj Tak after the meeting that the government's stance looked encouraging
 sarkaar bmes kii 12 sutreey maangon main se zyaadaatar par thos karrwai ke mood main dikhi he
 In the meeting on August 22, the government will definitely take concrete initiatives on many issues including minimum wages, its confidence has been found in Tuesday's meeting
 sarkaar ke rukh kii saraahnaabaithak main shaamil bmes ke kendriya sachiv pawan kumaar ne kaha ki bidi mazdooron ke hiton ko lekar sarkaar kaa rukh behad saraahneey rahaa
 The government has also given assurance to implement schemes for welfare of Anganwadi workers from social security
 maangen maani gayi to hadtaal wapasaunhone kaha ki sarkaar kaa ravaiya agar 22 agast kii baithak main kaaryrup main badla to majdoor sangh 2 sitambar ko hadtaal vaapasi par vichaar kar saktaa he, lekin agar sarkaar ne maangon par thos karrwai main anakani kii to hadtaal main jane ke sivaay bmes ke paas koi rasta nahin he
 The call for the strike on the 12-point demands is due to the fact that on 12-13 August, the National Working Committee of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh in Bhopal has decided to join the nation-wide strike called by the trade union on 2 September on the 12-point demands
 majdoor sangh ke netaaon ne aresas ke sahasarkaarywah dattatreya hosbale kii maujuudagi main hadtaal kaa prastaav paarit kiya or saaf kiya ki agar sarkaar ko mazdooron kii parvaah nahin he to mazdooron ko bhi sarkaar kii koi parvaah nahin
 The decision was taken at the BMS meeting, however, as soon as the BMS meeting ended in Bhopal, the government in Delhi sent a delegation of BMS leaders to consider all their demands

 The Jaipur court has also increased the difficulty of Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who is jailed in the rape case
 jaipur main ek shaks kii patni ke ramarhim ke ashram se gaayab hone ke maamle main adaalat ne police ko phir se jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 The court said that the wife of the victim should be searched in the ashram of Kiram Rahim and those who are suspected to be missing in the disappearance, should investigate the police and submit a report to the police court within a month
 kamalesh ke vakil babu laal bairava ne isaki jaankaree di
 The victim's husband Nekya said that Kamlesh Ragar, who lives in the Kachchi township of Jagatpura, Sejipur, is pleading with the police to get my wife back
 meri bivi ko gurmeet ram rahim ne apane sirsa ke ashram main kaid kar rakhaa he
 Kamlesh, who was raising his two young children alone, told that many people from the Kachchi Basti used to go to the camp, so they also took their wives and children with them
 vahaan hamaare parichit datta bhi the, jinhone ek jagah hamen rakhaa
 The next day my wife left my child and went to bathe with a serviceman, then did not come back again
 hamane jab ashram main poocha to kaha ki tum ab waapas chale jaao, tumhaari patni baba ke dhyaan main leen ho gai he
 When her focus is over, she will go away on her own
 police bol rahi- jahaan se laapata hui he, vahiin darj karaao kesaiske baad kai logon ko lekar vah deraa gaye, lekin unki kisi ne nahin suni
 When he went to the police station, the Jaipur police said that from where the wife went missing, go and register a case
 phir ek vakil sahab se mila, to unhone court ke istagasa ke jariye jaipur ke jawahar cirkil thane main mukadmaa darj karavaaya
 But the police put an FR in the court saying that it is not possible to investigate in Baba's ashram
 baba ko jed shrenee kii suraksha mili he
 But there are many criminal cases filed
 ram rahim ke bhakt dete the chup rahane kii dhamkeeis dauraan kamalesh ke pasram rahimake log dhamkee dene pahunch gaye
 These people threatened Kamlesh that either take money or shut his mouth, otherwise he will kill him
 iske baad police ne bhi inako thane se bhagaanaa shuru kar diya
 Fearing this, Kamlesh sat at home and took care of his two children, but after the arrest of Ram Rahim, he was again hopeful that his wife would be returned
 may 2015 main darj karaayaa tha pariwadakamalesh raigar ne 5 may 2015 ko court main pariwaad darj karaayaa tha ki 21 april 2015 ko wo or uski patni donon bacchon ke saath ram rahim ke sirsa ashram main gaye the, lekin do din baad vahaan par unki patni ko kaid kar liya gaya he
 The court had asked the Jawahar Nagar police station in Jaipur to file a case and present his wife
 aath may 2015 ko jawahar nagar thane main ram rahim ke khilaaf exiaar darj karavaaya gaya tha, jisamen police abtak jaanch nahin kar pai he

 Atif and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan are believed to be Salman's favorite singers
 donon singrs ne salmaan kii pichhali filmon main unke liye gaanaa gaae hai
 Salman has also faced criticism for missing a song from a Pakistani singer
 abhijit or sonu nigam jaise singrs ne bina naam liye kai baar iske liye dabang khan kii aalochana bhi kii he
 But now after the incident of Pulwama, it is not possible in India that any Pakistani singer can sing for Salman

 However, on social media, a group is demanding the expulsion of Pakistani artists

 salmaan jaanate hai ki aatif or raahat kii aawaaj unke upar suut karti he
 This time Salman's selfishness can cause serious damage to his reputation

 Tendulkar will retire after the second Test match being played between India and the West Indies in Mumbai
 yah unka 200waan test match bhi he
 Praising Tendulkar, who has been playing in international cricket for the last 24 years, Clarke said that he does not really believe that this Indian star has aged
 clark ne 'daily telegraph' main apane kollam main likhaa he, sachin tendulkar ke bina bhartiya test team bahut ajeeb najar aegi, jinka madhyakram main sthaan tay tha
 He will continue to be an inspiration for many generations to perform consistently well
 australian captain ne kaha, jab unhone apana test kariyar shuru kiya or 18 saal kii umr main australia ke apane pehle daure main do shatak jamaaye, to main primary skool main tha
 i played my first Test against him almost a decade ago and i never thought during my entire career that he had become old
 main vishwaas nahin kar saktaa ki vah 40 saal ke ho gaye hai
 "I was very fortunate to have played with and against some great batsmen, but in my time there was no one better than Sachin
" unhone jo kuch kiya, use dekhte hue sachin ko athulaneey breadman ke baad sarvakalik mahaan ballebaajon main duusare sthaan par hona chahie
 Clarke said that according to him Tendulkar's greatest achievement is to remain an active cricketer for more than 20 years
 unhone kaha, jab bhi maine sachin ko khelte hue dekha to puure manoyog or yuvaaon jaise utsaah ke saath khelte hue dekha
 This shows how much he still wants this game
 clark ne kaha, sachin kii uplabdhiyon ke bare main pichley kai saalon se kaaphi kuch kaha ja chukaa he
 His record runs in Tests and odis, centuries of centuries in international cricket, are records that will probably never be broken
 unhone kaha, haalanki meraa maananaa he ki unki sabase badi uplabdhi yah he ki vah pichley lagbhag 25 saal se antarrashtriya cricket main khel rahe hai
 It is worth mentioning that

 He said that now is the time to take tough decisions in Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki america raashtrapati donald trump ke baavjood bhi america se baatcheet chal rahi he

 India has maintained a mission to do so
 hafiz said ke anusaar bharat ye maanakar chalata he ki pakistan main uski baton ko mana jaataa he
 This is the second interview of Hafiz Saeed who came out after detention
 is dauraan aatanki hafiz kashmir raag alaapta dikhaa
 There is a ban on Twitter account that it has now come into action due to the prohibition on the financial assistance given by the US to Pakistan, which has become a refuge for terrorists
 pakistan ne mambai hamale ke mastermind aatanki hafiz said ke sanghathan jamaat ud daawa (jeyudi) ko blike list kar diya he, saath hi jeyudi ke twitor acount ko bhi suspend kar diya he
 The new list of suspended accounts of Twitter released by the Pakistan Ministry of Home Affairs also includes the name of Jamaat ud Dawa
 saath hi jeyudi ke sahyogi sanghathan falaah-e-insaaniyat foundation (exef) kaa bhi twitor acount suspend ho gaya he

 BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi has alleged that seeing the defeat of his party JD (U) in the Lok Sabha elections, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has become a philosopher
 unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar niraashaa main jivan, mrityu or kursi kaa thikaana na hone kii baat karne lage hai
 Sushil Modi has expressed his reaction to Nitish's statement on Saturday through a press statement today
 modi ne daawa kiya ki loksabhaa chunaav ke antim charan aate aate mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko jameen khisakane kaa abhas ho gaya he
 Like a philosopher in despair, he has started talking about life, death and whereabouts of the chair

 He claimed that despite having 210 meetings, when Nitish Kumar did not see the support of the public amid the BJP wave, he did not see anything good due to frustration
 'janata ne nitish ko nakaar diya'susheel ne aarope lagaaya ki sabhi jod tod ke baavjood janata ne bihar main sushasan or vikaas ke liye mili saal 2010 ke janadesh kaa apmaan karne vaale mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko nakaar diya he
 He alleged that the Chief Minister had to face opposition at meetings in his home district Nalanda and despite his camp in Madhepura, the party's national president was unable to claim the seat of Sharad Yadav
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhaajapa or congress par nakaaratmak baaten karne ke nitish ke aarope par susheel ne kaha ki ve bataaen ki mahangaai bhrashtachar berozegaar, seemaa par tanaav, aatankwaad, ugravad kii aantarik chunauti or sust vikaas ke mudde se bhatakaane ke liye sampradayikta ke mudde ko tool dekar ve kiski madad kar rahe the
 On the BJP being accused of spending huge amount in elections, Sushil said that before questioning the opposition party, the Chief Minister should tell how two choppers were arranged for the JD (U) election campaign
 gauratlab he ki nitish ne shanivaar ko ek sabha main kaha tha, ‚Äòjab jivan kaa thikaana nahin he to kursi kii kya baat kerani
 For the sake of principle, on the day i decided to break away from the BJP, i did not worry about the chair '

 yun to himachal pradesh ke vibhinn hisson se log shapath grahan samaaroh main shaamil hone ke liye pahunchenge lekin abaki baar mandi jila se zyada log samaaroh main shaamil honge
 Because this is the first time any MLA from Mandi district is likely to become the Chief Minister
 isse pehle ke mukhyamantri kangra, hamirpur or shimla jile se sambandh rakhte the
 Since Himachal Pradesh has only 68 assembly constituencies, the cabinet size of Himachal Pradesh is small
 niyamon ke mutabik himachal pradesh main kul 11 mantri banaae ja sakate hai lekin agar party sutron kii maane to pehle cabinet main kam se kam teen mantriyon ko shapath dilaai ja sakati he

 This statement of Madhya Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel may surprise you
 unhone harda jile ke timrani sthit anganbari main ek kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki narendra modi avivaahit hai
 In fact, while filing nomination in Varanasi at the time of Lok Sabha elections, Modi had confessed in the affidavit that he is married and his wife's name is Jashodaben
 lekin ab anandiben kaa ye bayaan soshal media par viral ho rahaa he
 Because she is saying that Narendra Modi is unmarried and did not marry for service to the country
 kaarykram main anandiben mahilaon or bacchon ke swasthya se judi yojanaon ke bare main zikr kar rahi thim
 Anandiben said in the program, 'the whole world knows, for your child
 
 
 aapke liye
 They did not marry
 pataa he na aapako, narendra bhai ne shaadi nahin kii
 But they know what problems women and children face during and after delivery
 isliye unhone itani yojanaayen banaai hai mahilaon ke liye
 Anandiben gave this statement on 17 June
 gauratlab he ki anandiben narendra modi ke behad karibiyon main se hai
 When Modi came to central politics from Gujarat, he handed over the throne to Anandiben
 haalanki gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle anandiben ko mukhyamantri pad se hataa diya gaya tha, lekin baad main unhen madhya pradesh kaa rajyapal niyukt kiya gaya
 Jashodaben lives in Gujarat
 jaankaree ke mutabik modi se alag hone ke baad jashodaben ne dholka se apni padhai puri kii or sarkari skool main teacher kii naukari se 2009-10 main sevanivruth hui
 Now she spends all her time in devotion to God

 isiilie fakhruddin ali ahamed jaisaa adarsh raashtrapati (agast,1974 se farvari,1977) bhi apni shishtataa ke liye nahin, balki apni kamajori ke liye yaad kiye jate hai
 In June 1975, he signed Mrs Gandhi's claim of unlimited rights without any question, due to which the country remained under emergency for 19 months
 us vakt ke behtareen vyangyakaar abu abraham ne raashtrapati kaa ek cartoon banaaya tha, jisamen unhen bathtub se samvidhan kii dhajjiyaan udaate dikhaaya gaya tha
 This memory has been permanently inscribed in our national consciousness, which is recorded as an adverse comment on the possibilities of a puppet or a dwarf sitting in Rashtrapati Bhavan
 hindustan kii janata raashtrapati chaahati he, kathputli nahin
 Abraham was nominated by Mrs
 Gandhi to the Rajya Sabha
 aazaadee ke baad ke pehle 19 saal main hamaare paas raashtrapati ke do model saamne aae
 a dr rajendra prasad or duusare sarvapalli dow
 As Radhakrishnan, who became President in 1960
 ye donon kaddavar rajnatik shakhyisat ke maalik the, buddhijivi the or kaabiliyat or eemaandaaree ke maamle main bhi donon samaan the
 Of the names that have come up for this year's presidential election so far, the three names that are discussed all meet these criteria: Pranab Mukherjee deserves all the appreciation above party politics, as we saw in the last parliamentary session
 Too; Abdul Kalam and Hamid Ansari are intellectuals who are respected everywhere
 " "raashtrapati kaa teesraa vikalp 1969 main saamne aayaa jab shrimati gandhi ne baari rajnatik jeet ke baad giri ko raashtrapati bana diya or avamulyan kii ek aisi prakriya shuru kii jiskaa nateeja jawaal ke rup main nikalnaa tay tha
 When Giri stepped down from the post in 1974, it was a matter of discussion that he had also taken the curtains of Rashtrapati Bhavan with him
 pichley paanch saal gavaah hai ki satta kaa pratik kaise majaak kaa paatr ban kar rah gaya he
 Sonia Gandhi bypassed Pranab Mukherjee's name in 2007 and put the name of Pratibha Patil forward, leaving her allies with cheats and watching the entire country become helpless
 shrimati patil kii uddeshyheenata ke ye paanch saal bitne par 13wein raashtrapati ke rup main mukherjee jaise kisi majboot shaks ko is pad par laae jane kii maang tej ho gai he
 This time Sharad Pawar and Karunanidhi are not ready to sit silent
 ve samuhik saraahna kii tarkeeb se sonia gandhi kii nijee ichha ko pehle hi baandh lene kii koshish main hai, isiilie congress ke kuch bolne se pehle hi unhone mukherjee ke naam kaa samarthan kar diya he
 Mamata Banerjee is more cautious, but she cannot afford to vote against a Bengali
 yadi hawa isi disha main bahati he, to mulaayam singh yadav ko bhi is disha main bahane main koi dikkat nahin he
 Some sections within the BJP also have a positive opinion about Mukherjee's name
 jaahir he mukherjee lambey samay se is pad ke hakdaar maane ja rahe hai, lekin vidambnaa he ki yadi koi ek shaks unke naam se inkaar kar saktaa he to ve khud sonia gandhi hai
 There is only one practical reason for Sonia Gandhi's hesitation
 ve is baat ko lekar aashwast nahin hai ki ek 'overlap‚Äô yani prabhavi raashtrapati ke taur par mukherjee kii bhoomika kya hogi
 If the first example of such 'overlap' President is counted, then first comes the name of famous Bharatanatyam dancer Rukmini Devi who could not become the President
 yah baat shaayad ham kabhi nahin jaan paaenge ki 1977 main pradhanmantri morarji desai ne 71 varshiya is nrutyaangna kaa naam kyon aage badhaayaa tha
 Morarji was not even a big art connoisseur
 haa, neelam sanjeev reddy ko lekar unke man main kuch nijee khunnas thi
 One of the facts behind his claim was that Mrs Indira Gandhi had stopped him from becoming President in 1969, but the wheel of time turned around to where he had left within a decade
 desai kii kisi ne nahin suni
 Reddy became the President
 lekin is baar maamla kuch zyada ghumaavdaar tha
 It was in 1980 that Reddy administered the oath of office to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and thus came into the role of an 'overlap' President whose tenure was divided between two politically hostile governments
 aakhri overlap raashtrapati hue abdul kalam
 In 2004, Sonia Gandhi went to him to claim the post of Prime Minister
 is bare main ab bhi vivaad he ki uske baad aakhir kya hua, lekin vahaan se lautne ke ek din baad sonia ne manmohan singh ke naam kii ghoshnaa kar daali
 All the Congressmen sang praise songs about his sacrifice which was also broadcast by Doordarshan with full dedication
 anuchhed 75 bhram kii koi gunjaaish nahin chodta he, ''pradhanmantri kii niyukti raashtrapati dwaara hogi or baaki saare mantriyon ko raashtrapati pradhanmantri kii salaah se niyukt karegaa
 "the President has the right to take the name of the Prime Minister of his choice as he does not have any cabinet for advice, whose decision he will await
" loksabhaa main pradhanmantri ko apana bahumat sabit karnaa hota he, lekin us avadhi ke dauraan koi bhi pradhanmantri ho saktaa he
 The Congress lost the elections in 1996, but no one could win them
 tab raashtrapati shankar dayaal sharma ne misaal pesh karte hue sabase badi party bhaajapa ke netaa ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya tha, haalanki ve khud or bhaajapa bhi jaanati thi ki sadan main use vot nahin milenge
 Hence Atal Bihari Vajpayee became the Prime Minister for 13 days
 yah baat alag he ki koi bhi misaal kanoon nahin hoti
 In the case of majority in the Lok Sabha, the more obscure the position of the parties, the more the President's jurisdiction increases
 aisi sthiti main jab kisi bhi badi party ko gathbandhan par apana rob kaayam karne laayak siten na mili ho, or chote dal samarthan ke evaj main rajnatik yaa aarthik phayda lene ke liye puri tarah aaazaad hon, to khatra ekadam saaf najar aata he
 This often happens in the states
 agle aam chunaavon ke baad raashtrapati kii bhoomika or adhik ahm hone vaali he
 Rahul Gandhi's future will depend to a large extent on the President's decision
 shrimati sonia gandhi donon pasandida pratyaashiyon-kalam or mukherjee-ko lekar pasopesh main hai
 They may wonder if Hamid Ansari will be able to manipulate the law in the hour of crisis
 isi vajah se may ke antim saptaah main ain maukey par kisi or 'sarprise' ummidavaar kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, yaa phir june main adhisuchana jari hone ke samay bhi aisa ho saktaa he
 Speculation over a tribal candidate has intensified as Rashtrapati Bhavan has so far been decorated by three Muslims and a Dalit
 ho saktaa he ki mukherjee ko nipataane ke liye congress kisi or ko chun le jiske ird-gird sahmati kaayam karne kii gunjaaish ho
 However, this time there has been a difference
 2007 main kaman sonia gandhi ke haathon main thi, lekin is baar congress kii jeet sunishchit karne ke liye uske sahyogiyon ne rajnatik rup se kamjor ho chuki congress ke haathon khilne se inkaar kar diya he
 They are not ready to obey the orders of the Congress
 bhavishya kaa daanv khilne ke liye jaruri he ki pehle aap apane vartmaan ko surakshit kar len
 And till the time of writing this article, the umbrella of security is in the hands of Pranab Mukherjee
