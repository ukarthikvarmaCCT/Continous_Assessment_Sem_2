 Gupta said, "with the end of 370, peace and prosperity will increase in the state"
 The former CM also said that the release of the detained leaders will be soon
 Attending the Ravana Dahan program in Jammu, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Kavindra Gupta said that Dussehra of the year is special because Jammu Kashmir has been freed from demonic forces
 gupta ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 nirast hone sejammu kashmiramen shanti or samruddhi kaa ek nayaa yug shuru hoga
 On the house arrest of the leaders in the Valley, he said that the politicians in Kashmir will be released soon
 kendriya grih mantriamit shahne abhi haal main aisa hi bayaan diya tha or kaha tha ki 5 agast ko rajya se hataaya gaya anuchhed 370 na sirf desh kii ekta or akhandta main baadhak tha, balki vah jammu kashmir ke vikaas main bhi sabase bada avarohak tha
 It has now been converted into two Union Territories - Jammu and Kashmir with Assembly and Ladakh without Assembly
 shah ne kaha, "mujhe drudh vishwaas he kianuchhed 370ko hataane ke baad ham kashmir se aatankwaad or aatankwaadi vichaardhaara ko puri tarah se khatm karne main safalataa hasil karenge
 In the next 10 years, our Kashmir will be in the list of most developed states of India
 " When Arvind Kejriwal resigned as the Chief Minister of Delhi in February 2014 after being in power for 49 days, he said that Delhi should hold elections immediately
 haalanki is tarah kii anushansa karne main uparajyapal (alji) najeeb jang ko aath maheene lag gaye
 Now the Central Information Commission (CIC) has asked to reveal the reasons for such delay in this decision
 darasal artiai kaaryakarta aditya jain ne soochna ke adhikaar kaa istemaal karte hue uparajyapal se kejariwal ke tyaagptr dene or nae chunaav kii ghoshnaa ke bich ke ghatnakram kaa silsilewar byoraa dene ko kaha tha
 At an interval of eight months between these two developments, Kejriwal then questioned that politicians could benefit from this by promoting defection and horse-trading
 lekin uparajyapal ne is sambandh main kendriya cabinet ko bheji gai soochna ko gopneeyata kii shrenee main bataate hue soochna kaa byoraa dene se inkaar kar diya
 As it is, the cold relations between Kejriwal and the Lieutenant Governor are well known and there has been a spate of accusations between the two parties in public
 tippaniyan When Aditya Jain approached the Central Information Commission on not getting a response to his RTI, the Commission, while disagreeing with the Lieutenant Governor, ordered all the relevant documents of that period to be made public
 ayog ne jor dete hue kaha he ki raajnneetik sankat se upje halaat kii sthiti main rajyapal yaa raashtrapati ko di gai salaah gopneeyata ke daayre main nahin aati
 Recently, the central government had argued that the reports submitted to President Pranab Mukherjee for imposing President's rule in these states amid the political deadlock in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh were treated as confidentiality
 gauratlab he ki in donon rajyon main congressi sarkaron ko satta se bedakhal kar diya gaya tha
 In the Uttarakhand case against this, the Congress returned to power by winning a case in the Supreme Court
 arunachal pradesh main congressi sarkaar ke patan ke baad party ke bheetar vidroh kaa bigul bajaane vaale purv congressi sadsy bhaajapa ke sahyog se satta main aae hai
 In fact, RTI activist Aditya Jain, while using the right to information, asked the Lieutenant Governor to give a detailed account of the developments between Kejriwal's resignation and the announcement of a new election
 in donon ghatnakramon ke bich ke aath maheenon ke antaraal par kejariwal ne tab sawaal khadey karte hue kaha tha ki isse dalbadal ko badhaava milane or horse-trading hone se rajaneta labhanvit ho sakate hai
 But the Lieutenant Governor refused to give details of the information sent to the Union Cabinet in this regard as a category of confidentiality
 vaise bhi kejariwal or uparajyapal ke bich ke sard rishte jagajaahir hai or saarvajanik rup se donon pakshon ke bich aarope-pratyarope kaa daur chalata rahaa he
 The comments apni artiai kaa jawaab nahin milane par jab aditya jain ne kendriya soochna ayog kaa darwaja khatkhataya to ayog ne uparajyapal se asahmati prakat karte hue us daur ke sabhi sambandhit dastavej janata ke bich saarvajanik karne kaa aadesh diya he
 The Commission has emphasized that in the event of political crisis, the advice given to the Governor or the President does not come under the purview of secrecy
 haal main centre sarkaar ne uttarakhand or arunachal pradesh main upje siyaasi gatirodh ke bich in rajyon main raashtrapati shashan lagane sambandhi raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ko saunpi gai reporton ko gopneeyata kii shrenee main maanane kii daleel di thi
 Significantly, the Congress governments in these two states were evicted from power
 iske khilaaf uttarakhand ke maamle main congress ne supreme court main cese jitkar satta main vaapasi kii
 After the fall of the Congress government in Arunachal Pradesh, the former Congress members who have played the bugle of rebellion within the party have come to power with the support of BJP

 "he said," i stand on my stand that AFSPA should be removed

 The sooner the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government is seen in Delhi, it is creating the same expectations and the same controversy
 is hafte kejariwal kaa dharna or somnath bharti kaa visilantism surkhiyon main rahaa
 The question here is whether there is any decrease in the popularity of AAP among all these, a survey on this front can give a boost to the Aam Aadmi Party
 yah survey enditivi ke liye hansaa research ne kiya he
 In this, more than one thousand people of Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru were consulted on 22–23 January
 nateeja yah dikhaa ki aadhe se zyada log kejariwal ke dharne kaa bhi samathrn kar rahe hai or kejariwal ko sabase behatar mukhyamantri maanate hai
 xxrep 50 - xxrep 4 - See: all the questions asked and their answers in the survey xxrep 55 - How did people like sitting on a dharna of a chief minister in front of Rail Bhawan in Delhi? Was this strike appropriate during his government? In the survey of Hansa Research, 51 percent of the people of Delhi got it right, while 39 percent people got it wrong
 jabaki bengalooru ke bhi 51 fisadi log iske saath dikhe, jabaki 35 fisadi iske khilaaf or mumbai ke to 58 fisadi log kejariwal ke saath aa gaye, lekin 30 fisadi logon ne ise sahi nahin mana
 But, another important question here is how is Kejriwal's job as Chief Minister? So in response, 19 percent of Delhiites called it very good, 39 percent said it was good, while 19 percent of Delhiites called it bad
 vahiin bengalooru kii agar baat karen, to 11 fisadi bengaloorevaasiyon ne ise bahut acha or 48 fisadi ne acha mana he
 Only 8 percent of Bengaluru people consider his work to be bad
 vahiin 28 fisadi mumbai waalon kii nigaah main kejariwal kaa kaam bahut acha or 45 fisadi ke liye acha he
 Only 7 per cent Mumbaikars were such that Kejriwal is doing a bad job in their eyes
 vahiin survey kaa aglaa sawaal tha ki kejariwal, dow harshavardhan or shila dikshit main koun behatar mukhyamantri he
 Kejriwal was seen ahead of his rivals here
 63 fisadi dilliwaale kejariwal ko behatar maanate hai, jabaki 23 fisadi harshavardhan ko or sirf 9 fisadi shila dikshit ko apana vot de rahe hai
 Similarly, Kejriwal is better in the eyes of 50 per cent of Bengaluru, 18 per cent with Harshvardhan and 21 per cent with Sheila Dixit
 mumbai main bhi 62 fisadi log kejariwal ko behatar maanate hai, vahiin 22 fisadi dow harshavardhan ko or sirf 3 fisadi shila dikshit ko
 Apart from this, public opinion on this one question is against Kejriwal's opinion on who is with the Delhi Police, near the center or with the state government
 yahaan 56 fisadi dilliwasi maanate hai ki police ko centre ke adheen hona chahie, jabaki sirf 36 fisadi maanate hai ki police rajya sarkaar ke adheen ho
 At the same time, 50 percent of Bengaluru people are of the opinion that the police is right under the center and 35 percent are entitled to hand over the Delhi Police to the Delhi government
 haalanki, yahaan mumbai waalon kii raay kejariwal ke kuch kareeb he
 42 per cent of Mumbai people believe that the police is fine with the central government, while 43 per cent of Mumbai people have the opposite opinion
 vaise is asahmati ke baad bhi dilli main aam aadmi party ke sitare buland hai
 If the elections are held again from now, according to this survey, the Aam Aadmi Party will get a majority on its own, because 57 percent of the votes of Delhi are going to AAP, 29 percent to BJP and 10 percent to Congress
 yani is survey ke anusaar abhi tak aap kii hawa he
 Looking at today's era, it seems that cricket has become a special choice of Bollywood directors because many films on the same subject are going to come up sequentially next year

 s
 dhoni: da antold story', 'ajahar' or 'joya factor' jaisi or bhi kai filmein hai jo cricket kii prishthbhumi par bani hai
 Even in the nineties, a film was made on it, titled 'aval Number', the film's director was the late famous actor Dev Anand
 film main aamir khan ko ek cricketer ke kirdaar main dikhaaya gaya tha, haalanki yah film box offis par kuch khaas kamaal nahin kar pai thi

 Apart from this, Kumar Gaurav also played the role of a cricketer in the 1984 film 'all Rounder'
 ise dekhakar lagata he ki bollywood kaa cricket se rishta kaaphi purana he
 However, there is a difference between the films based on cricket made in earlier times and the films being made on this subject in today's era and that in the earlier films made, cricket was shown only as a backdrop through which love , Romance, Drama like emotions are performed
 agar aaj ke jamaane kii filmein jaise ki 'em

 Film Name: Badlapur- Don't Miss The beginningdirector: Shriram raghavanstar Cast: Varun Dhawan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Vinay Pathak, Huma Qureshi, Divya Dutta, Radhika Apte, Murali Sharma Duration: 134 minutescertification: a Rating: 4 Star 'badla' and in Indian films The history of revenge is very old
 kabhi maa or baap kii maut kaa badla, kabhi bivi or bahan ke saath balaatkaar kaa badla
 Sometimes the revenge with the fight between the enemies and sometimes the story of the ancestral revenge! Every decade, the story of revenge has been presented by the directors in the form of suspense and drama
 ab 2015 main kuch aisi hi badale kii kahani lekar aae hai diarector shriram raghavan
 How much of the story begins before the story begins, Ax forgets but the tree remembers the ax, but the tree remembers who had cut it
 is ek shuruaati kathan se hi badale kaa maahaul banane kii koshish kii he diarector shriram raghavan ne
 'badlapur' is the story of Raghu (varun Dhawan), who works in an ad agency
 uskaa ek hansata-kheltaa parivaar he
 But during a robbery in a bank there is some such incident, due to which his wife Misha (yami Gautam) and son are killed
 chori ke jurm main police ke haath aata he laayak (navazuddin siddiki)
 Now from here the story moves to the next stop
 raghu ke man main baar-baar bivi or bachche kii tasviren chalati rahati he or vah badla lene kii tadap badhati jaati he
 Raghu also has to wait for about 15 years to get revenge
 phir alag-alag tareeke se badla liya jaataa he
 Finally a very big conclusion comes out
 agar aap yah film dekhne ja rahe hai to dhyaan rakhen ki isaki shuruyaat naa chhootane paae
 Why see the revenge story? Every character in the film makes you think
 raghu ke rup main varun dhawan kaa alag hi flavor darshakon ke saamne he
 He was still seen laughing and joking, but this form of his would be the most liked
 varun ne film main do alag-alag umr ko nibhaayaa he
 The actress of the film stars Huma Qureshi as Jhimli or Radhika Apte as Kanchan aka Koko
 samaaj sevi ke kirdaar main divya datta ho yaa raghu kii patni ke rup main yami gautam
 Everyone is beautiful
 film main ek aisa kirdaar bhi he, jiske parde par aane kaa aapako intjaar rahata he
 The all-round style Nawazuddin played 'laiq' makes you remember even after watching the movie
 'badlapur' kii casting, likhaawat or nirdesan teenon kii bhoomika main shriram raghavan ne apni chhap chodi he
 It would not be wrong to say that he has avenged the failure of 'agent Vinod' with this film
 film kii ek or khaasiyat he iske gane
 The special thing is that no song in the film slows its pace
 kyon naa dekhen'badlapur' ek edlt film he
 Is violent
 yani agar aap vayask nahin hai to ye film aapako bilkul nahin dekhni chahie

 meghalaya main sabase badi party banane ke baavjood congress bahumat hasil nahin kar pai
 The Congress has won the maximum 21 seats here
 goa or manipur jaisaa haal meghalaya main na ho, iske liye congress kaa haikaman active ho gaya he
 This is the reason why late night Meghalaya Congress President Vincent Pala and Congress General Secretary CP Joshi met Governor Ganga Prasad
 saath hicongress kii taraf se sarkaar banane kii daavedariwala letters bhi saunpa
 The letter states that the Congress party has emerged as the largest party in the state assembly elections
 sanvaidhanik niyamon ke anusaar congress ko jald se jald sarkaar banane ke liye nimantran diya janaa chahie
 The party will prove its majority according to the day and time fixed in the assembly
 vahiin ek taraf jahaan joshi or paala ne rajyapal se mulaakaat kii to congress kii taraf se sarkaar banane ke liye meghalaya bheje gaye diggaj netaa ahamed patel, camel nath or mukul vaasanic duusari partiyon se samarthan lene ke liye pratinidhiyon se baatcheet kii
 On this, veteran leader Kamal Nath said that we have submitted a letter to the Governor, in which the Congress Party has been invited to invite the government to form the government
 saath hi bataaya gaya he ki chunaav main congress sabase badi party banakar ai he
 Simultaneously we are also in talks with other parties
 camel nath ke anusaar congress rajya main sarkaar banane ko lekar puri tarah se aashwast he
 The Congress, the biggest party in Meghalaya, has fallen short of the Congress majority figure in the Assembly elections with 60 seats
 use 21 siton par jeet mili he, jabaki bahumat ke liye use 31 siton par jeet chahie thi
 The National People's Party (NPP) has won 19 seats
 enpipi ne bijepi se alag chunaav ladaa tha lekin bahumat se pichhadane par wo bijepi se gathbandhan kar congress ko satta se baahar kar sakati he
 As it is, the NPP is an ally of the BJP in the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) and BJP leaders are also looking at an alliance with it
 bijepi ko bhi rajya main do siten mili hai
 The meeting started even before the BJP leadership sent senior leaders Kamal Nath and Ahmed Patel to Shillong
 shilong pahunchate hi ahamed patel ne kaha ki ham yahaan sarkaar banane aae hai
 In this sequence, the central leadership is meeting in Shillong with the leaders of the Meghalaya Congress
 nateezon se saaf he ki congress agar kuch nirdaleey yaa chote dalon ke vidhayakon ko apane saath laane main safal hoti he to vah rajya main apni satta bachaa sakati he
 In such a situation, whoever takes independent or small parties in their ranks, will be able to form government in Meghalaya

 yah drishy kahin or nahin, islamic state kaa aatanki hamalaa jhelane vaale france kii rajdhani paris main dekhne ko mila
 On Friday, as the whole world was paying tribute to the people killed in the terrorist attack in France and people in Paris were feeling shocked, a Muslim youth appeared blindfolded on the roadside
 ye shakhya logon se gale lagane kii apil kar rahaa tha
 The Parisians should be commended that they respected the feelings of this Muslim young man and many people also fulfilled his wish
 kuch log to bhavuk bhi ho gaye or unki ankhon se aansu chhalak gaye
 Standing close to the Place de la Republics, the person had a couple of daftis (placards), some simple messages were also written
 ek sandesh kuch is prakaar kaa he
 i did all this so that i could convey this message to everyone
 main musalmaan hum, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki main ek aatankwaadi hum
 i never killed anyone
 vah shaks sandesh main kah rahaa he ki muslim hone kaa matlab yah jaruri nahin ki vah aatanki ho
 In another message, he writes that a terrorist is a terrorist who kills another without any reason
 koi musalmaan aisa kaam kabhi nahin karegaa
 Our religion does not allow this to happen
 is puri ghatana par isse bada sandesh ho hi nahin saktaa tha
 The comments puure din is shaks ko tamaam agyaat logon ne gale lagaaya
 There was a time when a crowd gathered around him

 maine kabhi kisi ko nahin maaraa
 The man is saying in the message that being a Muslim does not necessarily mean that he is a terrorist
 ek anya sandesh main vah likhata he ki ek aatanki, aatanki hota he, jo bina kisi vajah ke duusare kii hatya karata he
 No Muslim will ever do such a thing
 hamaara dharm aisa karne kii ijaajat nahin detaa
 There could not have been a bigger message on this whole incident

 'this is going to be my first and only reaction to the whirlwind news that broke 24 hours ago and that i was swept up into
 i am not used to commenting on things like this nor taking them seriously but as this situation is spiraling and affecting people i love, i have to speak up
 Firstly, many years ago, i met the man of my life, father of our son and of the baby we are expecting
 He is my love, my best friend, the only one that i need
 Secondly to those who have indicated that i am devastated, i am very well thank you
 This crafted conversation isn't distressing
 And to all the media and the haters who are quick to pass judgment, i sincerely wish you a swift recovery
 Finally, i do very much wish that Angelina and Brad, both whom i deeply respect, will find peace in this very tumultuous moment
 With all my love Marion Ceci sera la première et seule réaction que j'aurai concernant la déferlante inouïe qui à commencé il ya de ça 24 heures et à laquelle je suis mêlée malgré moi
 Je n'ai pas pour habitude de commenter ni de prendre au sérieux le tas d'absurdités déversées à mon sujet mais la situation prenant une telle tournure et affectant des gens que j'aime, je me dois de m'exprimer
 Pour commencer, j'ai rencontré il ya quelques années l'homme de ma vie, le père de notre fils et du bébé que nous attendons aujourd'hui
 Il est mon amour, mon meilleur ami et le seul homme dont j'ai besoin
 Ensuite, à ceux qui me prétendent dévastée, je vais très bien merci
 Ce genre d'inventions aberrantes ne m'affecte en aucun cas
 Et pour finir, à la "presse", à tous les haters, trolls et consorts qui ont le jugement si rapide je vous souhaite sincèrement
 
 
 un prompt rétablissement
 Ceci dit et un peu plus sérieusement, je souhaite à angelina et brad, deux personnes pour qui j'ai un profond respect, de trouver la paix dans ce moment tumultueux
 Avec tout mon amour

 These are the slogans that have been given to promote the education of girls
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ladakiyon kii padhai par vishesh jor dete rahe hai
 At the same time, the focus of Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has also been on completely freeing the state from the curse of female feticide and encouraging girls for education
 ab ye baat alag he ki haryana ke rewadi main ladakiyon ko padhai ke liye apni jang khud ladani pad rahi he
 More than 80 girls from Gotha Tappa Dahina village in Khol block of Rewari have been on hunger strike for the past one week
 inaki maang he ki gaanv ke 10veen tak ke skool kaa darja badha kar senior secondary kiya jaae jisase ki vahaan 12veen tak padhai ho sake
 The girl students here have to go to school in Kanvali for further studies from 10th standard
 ye skool inke gaanv se kareeb 3 kilometre dur he
 According to the girl students, they have to be a victim of flirting on their way to and from school every day
 gaanv ke sarpanch suresh chouhan kaa kahana he ki chhedchhad karne vaale shohade kism ke ladke itane shaatir hai ki helmet pahane rakhte hai, jisase ki unki pahchaan naa ho sake
 The fast deteriorated the condition of 4 girls, the girls told their sarpanch as well as their families
 gharavaalon ne to ladakiyon ko yahaan tak kah diya ki skool chhod do
 At the same time, the sarpanch took up the matter with the local authorities but the matter did not materialize
 aakhirkaar in ladakiyon ne khud hi morcha sambhalate hue bhukh hadtaal shuru kar di
 One is that due to the scorching heat and hunger strike from above, the health of four girls was worsened and they had to be admitted to hospital
 ek ladki ko pijiai rohtak refer karnaa padaa to do ko rewadi troma centre main bhartee karana padaa
 The shocking statement of the Education Minister of Haryana, on the one hand, the students are fasting in the scorching heat for the past one week
 vahiin haryana ke shiksha mantri ram vilaas sharma chaatraon ke virodh ko kahin naa kahin raajnneeti se jod kar dekhte hai
 According to Sharma, he appeals to the students not to get caught in the politics
 sharma ke mutabik skool ko apgrade karne kaa kaam prakriya ke tahat hoga or wo chaatraon ko aashwaasan dete hai ki sheeghra hi karrwai shuru hogi
 Sharma also said that in Haryana too, the police has started a campaign to stop tampering on the lines of the anti-romeo squad of Uttar Pradesh
 haryana ke dijipi khud 'oparation durga' kii nigaraanee kar rahe hai
 Sharma also appealed to the girls to end their sit-in
 ladkiyaan apni maang par adinek haftaa bitne ke baad ladakiyon kii maang par kisi ne sud nahin lee to unhone khud hi gaanv ke skool ke get par taala jad diya he
 These students say that the situation that we are going to face at this time, we do not want our younger siblings to face the same thing
 ladakiyon ke mutabik jab tak skool ko apgrade karne kii unki maang puri nahin hoti tab tak chote bhai-bahanon ko bhi skool nahin bheja jayega
 The girls say that until the matter of upgrading the school is not given to them in writing, their fast will continue and the lock of the school will not be opened
 gaanv ke sarpanch suresh chouhan ladakiyon kaa manobal badhaane ke liye khud unka anshan main saath de rahe hai
 Explain that to end the students' fast, Kosli MLA Vikram Contractor had reached the spot, but the students made it clear that they would not back down until their demands were met
 vidhayak ne chaatraon kii maang ko jaij bataate hue kaha ki unhone is maamle main shiksha mantri se baat kii he
 If the number of children in the village school increases, then they will upgrade the school
 vahiin, jila moulik shiksha adhikari raaj kumaar kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kii taraf se skulon ko apgrade karne ke liye sarkaar kii ore se kuch maanak tay hai
 If these are completed, letters can be sent to higher authorities to upgrade the school
 shiksha vibhaag kaa kahana he ki secondary skool ke taur par skool ko apgrade karne ke liye chaatr-chaatraon kii nunatam sankhya nirdhaarit hai
 But the school in the village has fewer students than that number
 iske baavjood shashan tak chaatraon kii maang ko pahunchaaya jayega
 It is now to see when the Manohar Lal Khattar government, which has garnered accolades from the budget and advertisements of crores on the girls' education campaign, wakes up from sleep over the legitimate demand of the girls of Rewari

 There are reports in Bollywood corridors that Salman Khan removed Arijit Singh's song from the film Welcome to New York and got it recorded by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan
 yah khabar aane ke baad se har koi jaananaa chahta he ki isamen kitni sachai he
 Has Dabangg Khan not forgiven singer Arijit Singh yet? Bollywood Life has revealed in its report that sources said that there is absolutely no truth in this news
 report main kaha gaya he ki film 'welcome tu neuyork' main salmaan khan kaa sirf chemiyo he, yah salmaan kii film nahin he
 So it is important to know that Salman has nothing to do with its music
 khud salmaan bhi yah khabar padhane ke baad se hairaan hai
 The report claims that Arijit may be the reason for not getting the song
 donon ke bich aisa kuch hua hoga ki is gane par baat nahin ban pai
 Ultimately, the producers have to decide
 4 saal baad bhi arijit se naaraaz hai salmaan, film se hataaya gaanaaise maamle main aadhikarik taur par abhi salmaan or arijit kaa koi bayaan saamne nahin aayaa he
 The cold war between Salman and Arijit is well known, but only time will tell how much truth is there in the news that replaces Arijit in someone else's film
 babul supriyo ne kiya paak kalakaaron kaa virodh'welcome tu neuyork' ke isi gane par bollywood ke mashhoor singer or kendriya mantri babul supriyo ne naaraazgi jataate pakistani kalakaaron par bain lagaae jane ke mudde ko uthaaya he
 Babul Supriyo said that it is a crime for Pakistani artists to be Pakistani, so Bollywood should not be related to them in any way
 unhone nirmaataaon se film ke gane ‘ishtehaar’ ko hataane yaa phir kisi bhartiya singer kii aawaaj main gaae jane kii baat kii he
 He said, this song could have been better presented by Indian artist Arijit Singh

 Baba Ramdev's visit to Chhattisgarh has cost the BJP dearly
 baba ramdev ne rajya ke aadha darjan se zyada jilon main apane yoga shivi lagaaye or vahaan apane bhaashanon main congress kii jamkar bakhiyaan udhedi
 Baba Ramdev praised the BJP and Narendra Modi elsewhere
 congress kii shikaayat ke baad chunaav ayog ne baba ramdev ke shivi or unke dauron par hone vaale kharch ko BJP ke khate main jodne kaa faisla kiya he
 Yoga guru Baba Ramdev organized yoga camps in many districts of the state from October 4 to October 8 and also visited rural areas to meet his supporters
 baba ramdev ne bastar ke sarguja or sarguja se rajanandgaanv tak ke ilaake kaa bhraman kiya
 He also held several meetings here
 kai ilaakon main yoga shivi lagaaye
 In all these areas, Baba Ramdev hoisted the Congress
 unhone apni is yatra ko puri tarah se rajnatik rang de diya
 As a result, the Congress also came into action and reported the matter to the Election Commission
 chunaav ayog ne praathmik rup se shikaayat ko sahi paaya or baba ramdev kii yatra kaa kharch BJP ke khate main jodne kaa faisla le liya
 Chief Electoral Officer in Chhattisgarh, Sunil Kujur, said, 'as of now, in the information that has come, it is said that Narendra Modi will be a good PM and Raman Singh ji will be a good CM
 to use kah sakate hai ki wo ped news ke ketegory main laayaa ja saktaa he
 If so, to add to the account
 abhi dhamtari vaali main nahin dekha hum usamen bhi kharchaa to kisi party main nahin judega
 But there is no restriction in saying so, it is also not a violation of the code of conduct
 'BJP ke khate main kitni rakam judegi iskaa akalan abhi nahin kiya gaya he
 Congress' mustache has blossomed with Baba Ramdev's expenses being added to bjp's election expenses

 The question-and-answer sequence between the power and the opposition on the Rafale deal continued in the Lok Sabha on Friday
 jahaan congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne sarkaar se rafel deal par kuch sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye kaha, vahiin raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne zyaadaatar sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue kai aise sawaal uthaae jisase congress ko asahaj hote dekha gaya
 However, even after the defense minister's reply, the Congress president was found to have claimed that he did not get a clear answer to his questions
 lekin bahes ke dauraan raksha mantri dwaara uthaae gaye in muddon par congress apana rukh spasht karne kii kavayad karegi
 The first defense minister of Nirmala said that after 2001, the exercise to strengthen the air force in India's neighboring countries China and Pakistan was going on in full swing
 iske chalate 2002 main yah faisla hua ki bharat ko bhi china or pakistan kaa muqabla karne ke liye jald se jald vayusena kii jaruraton ko puraa karnaa chahie
 But after this, the UPA Congress government, which remained in the center till 2014, started such a process of purchasing fighter aircraft which was not completed during his tenure
 nateeja yah rahaa ki 10 saal ke kaarykaal ke baad bhi aise samvedansheel maamle main bhi congress sarkaar ladaaku vimaan kharidne kaa faisla nahin kar saki
 The defense minister questioned that what was the reason that during this 10-year tenure, the Manmohan Singh government of the Congress could not buy the fighter aircraft as per the requirement of the Air Force? Rafael Deal controversy: Know what Nirmala gave the answer to Rahul's question in Parliament Second question of Rahul Gandhi's question on the offset clause included in the Rafale deal, why the Narendra Modi government should not bypass the government company HAL He decided to induct Anil Ambani, but the Defense Minister said that the Congress is working to shed crocodile tears over HAL
 nirmala sitaraman ne sadan main kaha ki congress sarkaar ke kaarykaal main rafel utpaadak company daso ne echeel dwaara nirmit kiye jane vaale rafel vimaan kii guarantee lene se manaa kar diya
 The case was overshadowed by the NDA government-initiated Rafael Deal and Dassow was adamant that it would take the company two and a half times more time to manufacture Rafale aircraft in the hands of HAL
 lihaaja nijee company ko ofaset cloj main laana behad jaruri tha
 At the same time, during the tenure of the Congress government, the Parliamentary Standing Committee made it clear that HAL is a company running on crutches and it would be wrong to expect to build this level from it
 lihaaja, nirmala ne sawaal kiya ki ab kyon congress echeel par ghadiyaaloo aansu bahaane kaa kaam kar rahi he?nirmala kaa teesraa sawalraksha mantri ne sadan ko bataaya ki congress adhyaksh ke france daure se pehle kendra sarkaar kii taraf se france jane vaale dal ko saaf kaha gaya ki vah france sarkaar se kisi dwipaksheeya muddon par vaarta nahin karegi
 According to Protol in bilateral relations, an important issue between two countries is discussed only between the government and the government
 aisi sthiti main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kyon france ke raashtrapati se rafel saude par vaarta kii? kya vipaksh kii party dwaara desh ke dwipaksheeya rishton main aisa dakhal uchit he?nirmala kaa chauthaa sawalraksha mantri ne kaha ki purv kii upie sarkaar rafel saude main daso se sirf 18 ladaaku vimaan kharidne ke masaude par kaam kar rahi thi or bache hue 108 vimaanon kaa nirmaan vah echeel ke jariye karana chaah rahi thi
 But the truth of the UPA deal is that the erstwhile government neither signed an agreement with the French government nor Rafael producer Dassau for construction in HAL
 yadi congress sarkaar echeel ko is deal main laa rahi thi to kyon usne france athwa daso ke saath koi samjhauta nahin kiya?rafel kaa vanshavaad: tajurba nahin, parivaar dekhakar dasolt ne kiya ambani se kararnirmala kaa paanchvaan sawalloksabhaa main nirmala sitaraman ne poocha ki kya congress kii upie sarkaar apane kaarykaal ke dauraan vaaki france ke saath raksha sauda karnaa chaahati thi? nirmala ne bataaya ki upie kaarykaal ke dauraan rafel saude ko kendra sarkaar kii manjuuri milane ke baad upie ne hi vitt mantralay ke jariye is deal par sawaal khadaa karte hue export samiti se jaanch karai
 When this committee also gave its approval in favor of the deal, the UPA government withdrew from the agreement with France
 aakhir congress kii manmohan singh sarkaar ko is deal main kis cheez kii kami khal rahi thi? rakshaamantri ne kaha ki is deal ko atakane ke baad tatkaaleen raksha mantri (pi chidambaram) ne 6 farvari 2014 ko sadan main kaha ki ‘ware ij da mani’ (paisa kahaan he)
 So, whether the Congress government was in agreement with France without provision of money from the treasury or the Finance Minister was reacting to any other kind of money in the House
 nirmala ne poocha ki kya congress sarkaar ko is deal main kik-back (kamishan) nahin dikhaai dene ke chalate deal karne main ruchi nahin thi? Naresh Aggarwal has been criticized after breaking the ties with the Samajwadi Party and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
 vivaadit bayanon ke liye charchit rahane vaale naresh agarwal ne somvaar ko bhagava party ke saath nai pari kii shuruyaat karte hi ek or aisa bayaan de daalaa, jisane unhen maafee maangane par majaboor kar diya he
 Naresh Aggarwal's remarks on the wife of megastar Amitabh Bachchan and Samajwadi Party leader Jaya Bachchan from SP, were dismissed by the party spokespersons, including women leaders of BJP, while denying the statement
 lekin vivaad yaheen nahin thama
 When the opposition started making it an issue, not only Naresh Aggarwal came on the back foot but the BJP also had to consider
 pehle mangalvaar subah naresh agarwal ne khud apane bayaan par khed jataayaa
 After which now news is coming that Naresh Aggarwal has been given advice from BJP
 bijepi sutron ke mutabik, naresh agarwal koparty line kaa dhyanarakhte hue bevajaah kii bayaanbaji se bachane kii taakid kii gai he
 In his very first press conference after joining the BJP on Monday, Agarwal had targeted the Samajwadi Party for preferring Jaya to his place
 unhone kaha tha ki party ne unki tulana film abhinetri se kii he 'jo filmon main naachati thim
 However, his statement made the BJP leaders sitting there uncomfortable and he immediately distanced himself from this statement
 baad main videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj or kendriya mantri smriti irani ne naresh agarwal ke bayaan ko galat tehraaya tha
 Aggarwal expressed regret, however, Naresh Aggarwal gave clarification on Tuesday after the controversy over the statement
 unhone kaha, 'mere bayaan se kisi ko koi ksht hua he to mujhe uskaa khed he
 i do not want to get into any controversy and regret it
 mere bayaan ko media ne alag tareeke se dikhaaya he
 i did not intend to hurt anyone
 main apane shabd waapas letaa hum

 "let us tell you that before the terror attack in Pulwama, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan held a press conference on Tuesday
 unhone pulavama kii ghatana main pakistan kaa haath hone se inkaar karte hue kaha ki bina kisi subut ke kyon jimmedaar tehraaya ja rahaa he
 He said that what is the benefit of Pakistan from this incident
 jab pakistan sthirataa kii ore ja rahaa he
 When thousands of Pakistanis have been killed due to the war
 phir aisi ghatana se pakistan ko kya phayda he
 Imran Khan said that no one went there and attacked us from our land
 phir bhi kisi kism kii aap tahakikat karnaa chahen to ham taiyaar hai
 If you give proof of Pakistan's involvement, then i guarantee that i will take action
 imran khan ne yah bhi kaha ki agar bharat yuddh karegaa to pakistan sochega nahin balk jawaab degaa
 Because Pakistan will have no other option than this
 unhone kaha ki ham sab jaanate hai ki yuddh shuru karnaa aasaan he, yah insaan ke haath main he, magar yuddh khatm karnaa insaan ke haath main nahin hota
 This issue will eventually be resolved by Dialogue

 vyangy sangrahamaja loktantric thes kanarad kii chintasushil siddharthasamyik books, dariyaganj,dilli-02keemtah 395 ru
 Satire is the natural literary response of an educated mind on the events around you - accidents, deceit of human behavior, travesty, scams, scams, etc
 aazaadee kii saathottaree peedi se vyangy, lekhan kaa ek anivaary ang rahaa he
 Authors like Harishankar Parsai, Sharad Joshi, Rabindranath Tyagi have contributed in making it a habit of readers
 par vyangy ke aaj ke paridrishy main vishay, style or bhashaa main nijee pahchaan liye susheel siddharth jaise lekhak bhavishya ke prati nai aashaa jagaate hai
 He has rightly said in self-immolation, "manish, forgive me for making every thing a matter of jokes
 tahaakaa or thes kaa antar thodaa-thodaa jaan chukaa hum
 Narada's concern is Sushil's collection of seventy-five satirical articles
 susheel kii bhashaa jeevant or pravahamayi he
 One review: "nowadays there is a lot of potential in the world
 chaar praadhyaapakon ne tay kiya ki isamen unhen hastkshep karnaa chahie
 a week later, the day Sunday
 chaar vidwaan jeep par janadesh kii bhaanti laden hue the
 Jeep was running towards a village like democracy
 '' susheel ke vishyon kii vividhta kuch sheershakon se jaahir he jaise 'nae ko napo', 'bhale ghar kii ladki', 'saath paar kii kuch yojanaayen', 'bhootpurv premika se muthbhed', 'samskruti main saas' vagairah-vagairah
 Satire writing has been done to the extent of boredom on politics
 ganimat he ki susheel ne netaaon ko baksh diya he
 The raw material of satire is scattered in other areas of life
 unki lager drushti ne use chunaa he or safalataa se uski cheer-faad kii he
 One of them is the Kamalgaopanishad
 iske kul jamaa unniis rochak or dilfareb sutara hai
 Another introspective exception is a political satire
 haara netaa aatmachintan karne se vivash he kyonki ''chunaav se pehle meri aatma mere netaa ne dilli mangava lee thi
 It was said that i will return from the courier after the election
 abhi tak aatma kaa korier nahin aayaa
 What i do
 khaali gaddha mathun?''naarad kii chintaa ek shreshth vyangy rachana he
 In one of its dialogues, Narada says, "owls do not need publicity, Lord
 loktantr main ulluon kii mahima se sab parichit hai, lekin prabhu lakshmi vaahan kis party se khadey ho rahe hai?''vishnu gambhir ho gaye, ''usne apane tamaam clon banaakar sari partiyon main ghusaa die hai
 Dear Uluq's effort is that no matter the party wins, power remains in our hands
 '' susheel ne is sangrah ke madhyam se apni nai jameen or muhaavara taiyaar kiya he
 Narada's concern is documentary evidence of his definitive arrival in the first line of budding satirists
 vichaarkon ne hindi ke bhavishya par jataai chintaacchhi or buree sahitya par hui gambhir charchasahitya ajtak ke aakhri din ravivaar ko hallaa bol manch par lekhak, aalochak, patrkaar or bhashavid ashok vaajapeyi or rahul dev ne sahitya, bhashaa or inaki praasangikta par baat kii
 On the marketization of literature, Rahul Dev said that being in the market of literature is not abusive
 ye koi buree baat nahin he
 Literature has been in the market since the beginning
 sahitya kaa akaash, pataal, aasmaan rahaa he
 There is no period of literature when everything was right
 pathak ke bagaiyr lekhak kaa koi matlab nahin he
 There is also a market of market literature
 kai logon ne tathakthith baazaaroo chijen padhi hai
 For the market, writing only to get more readers to sell is wrong
 vichaardhaara main rahakar use prashnaankit kar saktaa he sahityah ashok vaajapeyshok vaajapeyi kehete hai ki sahitya ke naam par vichaardhaaraon kaa takaraav ho rahaa he
 Conflict of views takes place in every society
 vichaar hota nahin, vichaar hote hai
 Take the metaphor from the market
 to ek jamaane main chandrakanta santati likhaa gaya tha
 There was also modesty literature
 ashleel sahitya bhi tha
 There were 4500 poets in Shadowism
 apane aap chijen samay ke koodaydaan main jaati rahati hai
 Russia was surrounded by the distortions of its own ideology
 vam vichaardhaara ne kai bade lekhakon ko banaaya, to kai bade lekhakon ko haashie par daalaa
 It is not that there is no ideology
 ek jamaane main sirf dhara hoti thi vichaar nahin hota tha
 Even if true literature is written in ideology, they question ideology
 vichaardhaara kaa gulam lekhak zyada din nahin chal saktaa
 At the time of independence literature had two vision
 ek premchand doosraa prasad
 But independence was the core of both ideologies
 bas lekhnee kaa tarika alag tha
 Asking questions in literature has been going on since the Vedas
 is samay sahitya main nayaa ativadah ham-ham hai or ve-ve hamrahul dev ne kaha ki vaicharik ativaadita, ashishnutaa or ashprishyata bhi rahi he
 There was a monopoly in the disciplines of knowledge
 hamaare jaison ko haashiye par rakh diya gaya tha
 Ashok Vajpayee said that i too have been a victim of this extremism
 ye ab utaar par he
 Despite the ups and downs, its response is also extreme
 is samay ye atvaad he ki ham ham hai
 They are they
 ise sahitya ko khatm karnaa hoga
 It is the work of literature to destroy this duality
 gorki kii maa kii tulana main hindi main koi kitaab likhi hi nahin gaiah ashomshok vaajapeyi ne kaha ki gorki kii maa kii tulana main hindi main koi aisi kitaab nahin likhi gai
 It was the strategy of Russia to bring their ideology to you in your language at a low price
 maine bhi us purvaagrah main apni patrika main vam vichaardhaara or vamavirohi vichaardhaara donon ko jagah di
 We gave place to all literature
 aisi patrikaayen hui, aayojan hue or lekhak hue jo har tarah ke sahitya ko pesh karte rahe
 Or she continued to pursue only one ideology
 ham jaik and jill or dafodil kyon padhein: rahul devisamen raajnneetik hamalaa bhi hua
 Why did we read the seasons of England
 ham dafodil kyon padhe
 Why did we read Jack and Jill? rus or china ke saath-saath angreji kaa bhi hamalaa hua
 Best literature has also been created in the world
 hamen use padhanaa chahie
 i am not in favor of building a fence for any literature
 sahitya sab jagah achh hota he
 Literature is a citizenship in its own right, it does not need a register: Ashokkshaya has changed now

 On Bharatiya Janata Party national president Amit Shah's statement on NRC, Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar said that he is very happy that Amit Shah is considering himself a Congressman
 unhone kaha ki 1985 kaa samjhauta or ye jo kadam uthaaya ja rahaa he inke bich kisi prakaar kaa sambandh nahin he
 He said, 'I myself was a joint secretary in Rajiv Gandhi's government
 jis samay is samjhaute par rajeev gandhi ne tay kiya us samay main unke saath hi tha
 On that basis, i say that there is no connection between what was written in the agreement and the action being taken on NRC
 'bataa den ki bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne assam ke rashtriya naagarik register (NRC) par kaha ki vipakshi dal is masale par desh ko gumraah kar rahe hai
 He alleged that the Congress could not show the courage to drive out the Bengali intruders during the vote bank and is now raising questions
 unhone kaha tha ki assam ecord jo rajeev gandhi ji kii adhyakshata vaali sarkaar ke samay main hua tha, NRC uski aatma he jisamen vyakhya kii gai he ki ek-ek avaidh ghuspaithiye ko chunakar desh kii matadaata suchi se baahar kiya jayega
 At the same time, Iyer said that in the then agreement it was said that a tribunal would be formed which after conducting a thorough investigation would come to the conclusion that which came illegally in March 1971
 jab tak supreme court ne is tribunel ko gaiyr sanvaidhanik qaraar nahin diya tha tab tak kaam bahut tareeke se achche se ho rahaa tha
 He said that an argument of the same manner should have been drawn, but what he has done is that suddenly 40 lakh who are residents of India
 unpar ab ekabahut bada sawalkhadaa kar diya gaya he
 He said, 'A list has been made, in which 40 lakh people have been questioned
 hamaare jamaane main or 1985 ke samjhaute ke tahat jin logon ko yah tay kiya gaya tha ki vahagaiyr kanoonee tarikese aae the unako waapas bangladesh bheja gaya
 Apart from him, Congress spokesperson RPN Singh said that Amit Shah should read a little
 rahul gandhi ne pehle hi fasebuk pej par is masale par apana stand saaf kar diya he
 The agreement was signed by Rajiv Gandhi, but the government did it flawlessly and used it for electoral gains in the election year

 vidhi mantri salmaan khurshid ne sansad bhawan parisar main kaha, ‘ham chahenge ki aam raay banane ke baad hi vidheyak rajyasabha main aae
 If the bill is brought and then tried to form a general opinion in the House, then it will cause some problems
 ’unase sawaal kiya gaya tha ki kya lokapal vidheyak sansad ke chaalu satr main liya jayega
 According to sources, the government may remove the provision for the formation of Lokayuktas in the states from the Lokpal Bill to convince opposition parties as well as opposition parties like the Trinamool Congress
 aisi charchaaen chal rahi hai ki ghatak dalon or vipaksh kii maang par jhukate hue sarkaar rajyon main lokayuktaon kii niyukti sambandhi praavdhaan ko rajyasabha main vidheyak ko laane se purv hataa sakati he
 However, a minister said on Wednesday that talks are still on with political parties to resolve the differences
 sutron ne bataaya ki bahupratikshit vidheyak main teen-chaar adchane hai
 The purpose of this bill is to establish an anti-corruption watchdog mechanism and the government is trying to form a consensus on these hurdles

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called an all-party meeting on 23 March to resolve issues regarding the bill
 baithak main koi aam raay nahin ban paayi lekin yah faisla kiya gaya ki dal vidheyak par baatcheet jari rakhenge
 The bill could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha in the Winter Session of Parliament last year
 vipaksh ne sarkaar par alpamat main hone ke kaaran mat vibhaajan se bhaagane kaa aarope lagaaya tha or hai voltage drame ke bich sadan ko anischitkaal ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya tha
 In the same session, the bill was passed in the Lok Sabha but it was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on the last day of the session and the Trinamool Congress, the constituent of the UPA, refused to help the government at the time

 elactoral bonds raajnneetik chande ke liye corporate jagat kaa sabase pasandida tarika ban gaya he
 According to a recent study by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), business houses have donated nearly Rs 2,000 crore in the last 6 years through electoral trusts and direct donations
 ye elactoral trust upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal main banaae gaye the
 Interestingly, only five months from January to May this year, the NDA government brought in double the amount of electoral bonds from the last 6 years
 ediaar ke adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki raajnneetik dalon ko corporate chande main haal ke varshon main khaasi badhottaree hui he
 The government claims to remain a secret through electoral bonds and says that only the bank issuing them knows the donor
 vahiin vipakshi partiyaan aarope lagaati rahi hai ki ye bond skim jis party kii sarkaar he, uske paksh main he
 There has been a change in the way political donations are made by business houses
 taaja study bataati he ki corporates raajnneetik dalon ko chanda dene ke liye elactoral bonds kii taraf shift kar gaye hai
 This is different from the ways of the past
 saal 2012 se 2018 ke bich kaarobaari gharaanon ne 1941
 Rs 95 crore donated to political parties
 ye kul chande kaa 91
 17 percent
 in chah saalon main raajnneeti dalon ko kul chanda 2129
 92 crores received
 isamen se 50 fisadi chanda 26 elactoral treston ke madhyam se aayaa jo congress kii aguai vaali upie sarkaar main banaae gaye the
 The rest was paid directly by the business houses
 march 2018 main modi sarkaar kii ore se elactoral bonds laae jane se sari tasviir badal gai
 Political parties received donations worth Rs 4794 crore between January and May this year
 2018 main march, april,july, oktober, november ke maheenon main 1056 karod rupee ke elactoral bond bike
 So far, a total of Rs 5851 crore worth of electoral bonds have been sold
 india today tivi ne pehle report kiya tha ki saal 2017-18 main bike kul elactoral bonds main se 95 fisadi chanda bijepi ko mila
 An RTI had revealed that out of a total of Rs 222 crore of electoral bonds, BJP received Rs 210 crore in donations
 ediaar ke head major general (ritred) anil verma ne india today tivi se kaha, ‘elactoral bonds ko isliye tarjeeh di jaati he kyonki ye apaardarshee hai, sirf chanda dene vaale, bank or sarkaar ko hi isaki jaankaree hoti he
 This is the reason why donations have increased faster when we come to electoral bonds than electoral trusts
 ’ediaar study bataati he ki haal ke saalon main corporates kii ore se raajnneetik chanda die jane main teji se ijapha dekha gaya he
 From 2004-05 to 2011-12, 87 per cent of the donations received by political parties from known sources came from business houses
 ye hissedari saal 2012-13 se saal 2015-16 ke bich badhkar 87 fisadi ho gai
 Between 2016-17 and 2017-18, the share of donations from business houses rose to 93%
 corporates se raajnneetik dalon ko chande kaa vishleshan bataata he ki sabhi rashtriya dalon ko unase chanda mil rahaa he lekin bijepi sabase pasandida party he
 Of the total donations received by BJP from known sources, 94 per cent came from corporates
 vahiin ensipi ko kul mili chande main se corporate kii hissedari 93 fisadi or congress ko ye hissedari 81 fisadi thi
 Even CPM got 55% of the total donations from corporates
 bijepi pravaktaa jiviel narsimha raav ne bijepi ko raajnneetik chande main se sabase moti hissedari milane kaa bachaav kiya
 Rao told India Today TV, 'BJP takes donations in a transparent manner while Congress does it in number 2 way
 nakad chanda unki parampara rahi he
 Rao alleged, "the Congress has a culture of collecting black money in cash, the Congress has created a parallel economy so that it primarily serves its political funding interests
" bijepi sabase badi party he isliye use raajnneetik chanda sabase zyada mil rahaa he
 The Congress hit back at the BJP and accused the government of finding new ways to suppress the opposition
 congress saansad piel puniya ne aarope lagaaya- ‘elactoral bonds ke jariye bijepi ne sara chanda hasil karne ke liye nayaa tarika nikaal liya he
 This is their way of working to suppress all funds of the opposition

 abir reiskaa dosha logon kii ati-vyastata ko den yaa phir unki nishcintata ko—vajah jo bhi ho, bahut se log samay se apni motor insurance policy kaa navinikaran karwaanaa bhul jate hai or phir aprabhavi ho chuki policy ke saath gaadi chalaate rahete hai
 It is possible that in the past people have not been making much difference when this happens, Rs
 1,000 kaa jurmaana bhar kar kaam chal jaataa tha
 But, for the first time since the new Motor Vehicles Act 2019 comes into force, you will be charged Rs
 2,000 dene padenge or yadi aap isi aparaadh main duusari baar pakade jate hai, to jurmaana doguna ho saktaa he
 This harsh punishment has increasingly led many vehicle owners to turn to insurance companies
 policybazar dotcom ke motor insurance vibhaag ke pramukh, sajja praveen choudhary kehete hai, ''sitambar main dupahiyaa vaahanon ke beemaa kii bikri main 7
 5 times and car insurance sales have increased threefold
 ''lekin, kisi expire beemaa policy kaa navinikaran karana kisi chaalu beemaa policy ko online navinikrut karaane kii tulana main adhik kathin kaary he
 The delay in renewal limits the options every day
 phir bhi, kisi nishprabhavi ho chuki policy ko pun: sakriy karavaaya janaa sambhav hota he
 Insurance renewal options Subramaniam Brahmajosula, head of underwriting and reinsurance at SBI General Insurance, explains, "you have many options online, such as going to an agent or reaching an insurance company's office through which you can get your vehicle Insurance cover can be renewed
 ''yadi aap apni policy kaa navinikaran isaki avadhi samaapt hone ke 90 dinon ke bheetar kara rahe hai to aap apane pichley 'no clem bonus' (enasibi) kaa laabh aage bhi paa sakate hai

 Sudhir says that in both the cases, you should keep the necessary documents ready
 ''online navinikaran ke liye bimakarta kii website par log on karen, apni chaynit beemaa yojana kaa vivaran darj karen or bhugtan karen
 For policy of offline renewal, go to the insurer's branch with the policy document '' - Election in third party and comprehensive insurance cover, as far as avoiding heavy fines, only third party insurance is enough
 tritiy paksh beemaa durghatana main aapke vaahan kii vajah se tisare paksh ko chot yaa kshati ke parinamswaroop hone vaale nuksaan kaa bhugtan karne main madad milti he
 Premiums for third party insurance are lower than comprehensive motor insurance policies
 haalanki, vyapak beemaa cover kaa vikalp chunane par aapako beemaa hasil karne main zyada samay lag saktaa he kyonki beemaa company cover ke liye aapkaa anurodh sweekaar karne se pehle vaahan kii sthiti ke bare main vivaran maangegi
 If this request is made within 90 days of the expiry of the previous policy, both the web aggregator and the online insurer can issue insurance without inspection of the vehicle but they can also deny it for longer
 sudhir bataate hai ki aisi sthiti main ''bimakarta cover ko navinikrut karne se pehle vaahan kaa puri tarah se nirikshan karegaa
 "" Minor damage is ignored, but if the vehicle has more than four minor dents or a single crack in the windshield, the proposal for a comprehensive protection policy can be rejected
 ''kuch bimakartaon or web agrigaters ke paas vaahan ke satyaapan ke liye ek digital self-inspection system bhi hota he jisamen aapako vaahan kii tasviren yaa video lene ke liye unke mobile ap yaa link kaa upyog karnaa hoga
 However, other insurers may insist on physical inspection of the vehicle through an individual
 suraksha ke liye beemaa jarurinaya motor vaahan adhinium 2019 lagu hone ke baad bina insurance vaahan chalaane par 4000 rupye tak jurmaana baari jurmaane se bachane ke liye tritiy paksh beemaa hi kaaphi he
 In this, compensation for loss from your vehicle to a third party is required to take a comprehensive policy to compensate for your vehicle
 yah tritiy paksh beemaa se mahangi hoti he
 The probability of renewal of the expiry insurance policy depends on the delay in the renewal after the expiry of the insurance
 90 din ke bheerat expire beemaa policy ko rineau karaane par no clem bonus kaa phayda miltaa he
 Physical verification of the vehicle becomes mandatory if there is a delay in renewing the insurance policy more than 90 days

 Yes! The name of that person is Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar
 vanade kariyar ke 70wein match main sachin ko opening mauka mila, jiskaa unhone bharpoor phayda uthaaya or ek ke baad ek kirtiman apane naam karte gaye
 Opening from Sachin in place of Unfit Sidhu, it was the decision of Indian captain Azharuddin to field Sachin as the opening batsman in the one-day international
 1994 ke newjiland daure main team india ke niyamit openar navjot singh siddhu kii gardan main pareshaani kii vajah se sachin se pari kaa aagaaj karaayaa gaya
 Sachin also wanted the same, for this he had appealed to captain Azharuddin and manager Ajit Wadekar
 newjiland ke khilaaf 82 ranon kii joardaar pari khelinujiland ke khilaaf chaar vanade maichon kii siries ke duusare match main sachin ne pehali baar opening kii
 He smashed 82 off 49 balls, including his 15 fours and two sixes
 newjiland ke olerounder govin larsan is match ko kabhi yaad nahin karnaa chahenge
 Sachin hit three fours and a six in his very first over
 aakhirkaar do over baad hi unhen gendbaaji se hataa liya gaya
 Chasing a target of 143 runs, India won the match by seven wickets
 sachin player of da match rahe

 4
 vanade kaa unka pehla shatak 79wein match main aayaa, vah bhi opening karte hue
 What did Sachin say on Azhar Nekaptan Azhar had said in an interview - i already had in my mind to get Sachin open
 paanchaven yaa chathe number par ballebaaji karte hue use 5 yaa 6 over hi khilne ko mauka miltaa tha
 i thought it is not being used properly by bringing down an aggressive batsman like Sachin in the lower order
 isi ke baad maine usase open karne ko kaha
 What Sachin Neschin told Wadekar in Autobiography- Playing It My Way revealed why he wanted to be the opening batsman - i had the ability to attack the bowlers
 vanade ke pehle 15 overon main field pratibandhon kaa phayda uthaanaa ek badi baat thi
 i wanted a chance to prove myself
 maine wadekar sar (tatkaaleen team manager) se kaha tha ki agar main asafal rahaa, to dobaaraa opening kii baat nahin karuunga

 aadhaar cardse judi jaankaree chori hone kii khabar saamne aane ke baad aadhaar athurity UIDAI ne turant ection le liya tha
 The Aadhaar Authority stopped the officials who had access to the data as soon as the news of Aadhaar data was stolen in the newspaper
 report ke mutabik kul aise 5 hajaar adhikariyon kii aadhaar data tak pahunch roak di gai
 In fact, on January 4, such a report came that there was a detail of crores of rupees for just Rs 500
 is khabar ke saamne aate hi UIDAI ne surakshatmak upaay kiye
 Under this, it stopped all private and government officials who were given limited access to access Aadhaar data
 iconomic times ne ek sarkari adhikari ke hawaale se yah baat kahi he
 In fact, earlier UIDAI had given limited access to the base data to some officers
 iske tahat sambandhit adhikari sirf aadhaar se judi demographic detail hi dekh saktaa tha
 He used to have access to the name, address, date of birth and other information of the Aadhaar holder
 iske liye use sirf 12 ankon kaa aadhaar card number enter karnaa padataa tha
 The officer said that after this UIDAI changed the system and access is given only after giving fingerprint
 isaki vajah se logon ko aadhaar detail apadet main hone main jarur samay lag rahaa hoga, lekin yah data li jaisi ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye ahm he

 isse pehle aadhaar athurity UIDAI ne aadhaar data li hone kii ashanka se inkaar kiya tha
 The authority had rejected the media report and said that the report misrepresented the elements
 athurity ne ek baar phir bharosa dilaayaa ki aadhaar detail surakshit he or kisi bhi tarah kaa data li nahin hua he
 The 100 crore Aadhaar detail was published by the English newspaper The Tribune
 isamen daawa kiya ja rahaa tha ki unhone ekavatsap grupase maatr 500 rupee dekar sarvice kharidi or 100 karod aadhaar card kii detail par unhen acces mil gaya

 isamen unhone bataaya ki aadhaar kii ye suvidha shikayaton ke nivaaran ke liye sirf kuch sambandhit adhikariyon aurarajya sarkaarake adhikariyon ko di gai he
 These people work by removing the doubts associated with Aadhaar by just entering the Aadhaar number

 Anjali Das says that she and her family members were named in the first two lists, but the names of her family members have been removed from the final list
 anjali kaa kahana he ki hamaare paas sabhi dastavej hai or pehle kii do list main hamaara naam bhi tha, lekin ab aakhri list se hamaare parivaar ke sadasyon kaa naam achaanak hataa diya gaya he
 We are being called foreigners
 yah kaise sambhav ho saktaa he? hamaare paas apane bhartiya hone kii baat sabit karne ke liye sabhi dastavej hai
 My father's name and address are all here
 ham behad tanaav se guzar rahe hai
 Instrument Das Anjali and her family, who were victims of the clerical error, have been living in Assam for decades, but now their husband has fallen victim to the instrument Das Clarical error
 pehali do list main unka naam badalakar sadhana das kar diya gaya or ab achaanak unka naam list se hataa diya
 When the name of the instrument Das was wrongly entered, he also applied twice to rectify it, but was not corrected
 saadhan das ek kisaan hai or assam ke morigaanv ke borakhal ke nivasee hai
 Along with the parents, the son and daughter are also concerned, Sunil Das, son of Daksharan Das and his daughter Kamla Das are also very worried about not being named in the list of NRC
 sunil das kaa kahana he ki enarasi list main naam nahin hone kii chintaa kii vajah se na khaanaa acha lagata he or na hi kaam main man lagata he
 The brain has also stopped working
 unka kahana he ki agar enarasi list main naam nahin aayaa, to na jane kya hoga?enarasi ko lekar kamala das ne kaha, 'hamane cese ladane or decri hasil karne main khub paisa kharch kiya
 We exhausted all our savings
 ab ham behad dukhi hai
 What if our name does not remain in the final list of NRC
 'maa-baap kaa naam shaamil, par bacchon kaa naam gayabaise halaat sirf assam ke ek jile main nahin hai, balki puure rajya main hai
 There is a story of some family in Neli area of assam that parents are named in NRC list, but their children's name is missing
 naseem ul nesa ne kaha, 'meraa or mere pati kaa naam enarasi list main he, lekin mere sabhi chaar bacchon kaa naam enarasi list se gaayab he
 Nothing is known about what will happen now
 kya bacchon ko bhi desh or skool chhodane ke liye kaha jayega? ham isko lekar behad niraash bhi hai
 However, the government has assured all possible help to the families who are originally residents of Assam in the next 120 days
 iske alaava riyajuddin ne bataaya, 'main kisaan hum or saath main mazdooree karata hum
 Over the past few months the NRC has done everything to name
 ab agar mere bacchon kaa naam enarasi main nahin he, to ham kaise yahaan rah paaenge or bacchon ko bina kaise naagarik kehlaayenge
 This situation is very worrying
