 According to Shakeel Kalander, an entrepreneur and member of the Economic Advisory Council of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the cursory assessment is that the economy of Jammu and Kashmir is estimated at Rs 1,00,000 crore

 About three lakh houses have completely or partially collapsed in nearly 2 million houses in the state, with floods in many districts like Anantnag and Pulwama in south Kashmir

 The people of Kashmir are hoping that the national infrastructure companies will build and hand over prefabricated houses as soon as possible — maybe some wealthy entrepreneurs adopt villages or parts of Srinagar city

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday held extensive talks with the heads of 19 countries of the African continent with the aim of establishing India's strong presence in resource-rich Africa
 isamen aatankwaad kii samasya se ladane or sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main sudhaar kii disha main kaam karne par mukhya rup se dhyaan diya gaya
 Solidarity against terrorism is necessary
 PM Modi in bilateral talks with African leaders emphasized that success in the fight against international terrorism can be achieved only when there is coordinated action at the global level
 vahiin sanyukt raashtra sudhaaron par kaha gaya ki milakar kaam karne or kadaa rakh apnaane kaa samay he
 Modi, while advocating further expansion of India's Africa relations, told ND Juma, chairman of the Africa Union Commission that India and Africa are made for each other
 kai kshetron main sahyog kii apekshagruuvaar ko yojit hone vaale bharat-africa forum shikhar-sammelan main shaamil hone aae africa netaaon ne swasthya, shiksha, krishi, khanan, urja, paryaton or matsaypalan samet kai kshetron main bharat kii sahaayta kii maang kii
 Terming terrorism as a major threat worldwide, Modi said that the legal gaps in the fight against it need to be eliminated
 modi ne buudhvaar ko zimbabwe ke raashtrapati robert mugabe, ghana ke raashtrapati jon di mahama, swaziland ke raja emsvati tritiy, benin ke raashtrapati boni yaai, nigerian raashtrapati mohammad buhaari, kenya ke raashtrapati uhuru canyatta, uganda ke raashtrapati yovari kaguta museveni, lisothe ke pradhanmantri bethual pi mosicili samet africa netaaon se dwipaksheeya baatcheet kii

 'he said that all the meetings were well done
 nigeria ke raashtrapati se mulaakaat main modi ne vahaan kii jail main band bhartiya chaalak dal ke 11 sadasyon se judi nyaayik prakriya ko tej karne kaa anurodh kiya
 The President of Niger proposed to sell uranium to India and demanded large investment from India in its oil field

 According to Swaroop, almost all African leaders were with India on the reform of the UN Security Council and said that one-third of the world's population cannot be kept away from the decision making process

 input language yadi bharat main koi abhi bhi nateezon main ruchi rakhata he, to congress antat aane vaale shanivaar ko yah tay kar sakati he ki uskaa aglaa adhyaksh koun hoga jo ki rahul gandhi kii jagah legaa
 Rahul Gandhi stepped down almost three months ago
 congress kaarysmiti yaa seedblusi, jo ki party kii ore se sabhi nirnay leti he, kii shanivaar ko baithak hogi
 This may include consideration of who may be eligible for the party chief
 isamen bade paimaane par aise netaa shaamil hai, jinhone 30 saal pehle chunaav ladaa tha
 According to CWC sources, a group of leaders will be formed to elect the next leader
 isamen kisi ummidavaar ke naam par sahmati ban sakati he
 This will generally be the ideal way for a strong political party to avoid internal elections that are fierce
 lekin jab ham congress ke bare main baat kar rahe hai, to varisht netaaon ke ek chote group ne purv party adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko bataa diya he ki is chunaav se party vibhajit ho sakati he
 Party treasurer Ahmed Patel is working for senior leader 59-year-old Mukul Wasnik, who last won the election from Ramtek in Maharashtra in 2009
 vaasanic kaa mukhya plus point yah he ki ve anusuchit jati ke netaa hai, jo na keval yogya hai balki gandhi parivaar ke baad party par apni pakad barkaraar rakhane kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye utsuk bhi hai
 Wasnik is the candidate of status quoists in the party who fear change
 unhen lagata he ki parivartan unke apane raajnneetik kariyar ko chaupat na kar de
 He is ideally like a member of the Gandhi family who wants to thrive in the palace court
 rahul gandhi kaa samarthan karne vaale bahut se netaaon kaa kahana he ki ve party main vaastavik main aisa parivartan chaahate hai jo party ko punerjeevit kar sake
 An aspiring young leader who would like to be elected as the chairman said to me, "if they again appoint Wasnik, walking on the pattern, the party will split
 ve chune hue netaaon se kyon darate hai? ve kyon asthai vyavastha chaahate hai?"yah bhi ek tathy he ki gandhi parivaar ke bich gahari paith rakhane vaale party ke yuva mahasachiv jyotiraditya sindhiya anpekshit rup se rank ko todaa or kashmir ke vishesh darje ko samaapt karne ke sarkaar ke faisle kaa saarvajanik rup se swaagat kiya
 This was off the party line
 party ke kuch netaa maan rahe hai ki jin logon ne modi sarkaar ke is kadam kaa swaagat kiya, jisamen milind devda, deependra hooda, janardan dvivedi or abhishek manu singhvi shaamil hai, ve bhaajapa main naukari ke liye aavedan kar rahe hai
 i talked to some young leaders about this
 unamem se ek ne poocha "main chunaav lard rahaa hum, main 40 saal kaa ho gaya hum, kya mujhe apana bhavishya likhnaa chahie, kyonki party to apana man nahin bana sakati?" unhone is tathy kii ore dhyaan dilaayaa ki party ne kashmir kaa vishesh rajya kaa darja chhinane ke maamle main ekajute pratikriya ke liye koi taiyaari nahin kii, jabaki vastav main whatsap dwaara sanchalit puure desh ko pataa tha ki modi sarkaar ne kya yojana banaai he
 Apparently, when the government canceled the Amarnath Yatra, asked tourists to leave the Kashmir Valley and stationed additional troops there, some young leaders held an immediate meeting of the Congress to decide on the response
 demanded
 lekin varisht netaaon ne jor dekar kaha ki sarkaar ke kaarywahi karne ke baad hi party ko apana paksh tay karnaa chahie
 Such a ruckus has become the identity of the Congress in response to the Modi government's agenda and content being established
 yah party ko kamjor dikhaata he or isamen siddhant, vichaardhaara yaa netritv kii kami ko ujagar karata he
 This time the leaders of the states of Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand who would vote for their new governments in the next two months revolted Article 370 in confusion
 ve varisht netaaon ko bataa rahe hai ki party janata ke mood ke vipareet ja rahi he
 Rahul and Sonia Gandhi then intervened and said that the resolution would reflect the party's unhappiness over the process under which the BJP removed the special status given to Kashmir by Article 370
 ek netaa jinhone artical 370 ko nirast karne kaa swaagat kiya, kehete hai, "mere liye to yah jokhim he
 Ghulam Nabi Azad who took the over-the-top post and has no career in the party left in Srinagar or Delhi
 " congress main kuch isi tarah ke akalan adhikansh netaaon ke hai
 If on Saturday, the party hands over the charge to Wasnik or to a group, a lot of leaders can walk out as usual, saying that the Congress has no ability to improve itself
 yadi party punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh kii ek yuva jamini netaa ko party adhyaksh banane kii vakaalat kaa anusaran karti he, to yah kai logon ko baahar jane se roak saktaa he
 But the interesting thing is that there is no talk about the option of youth power
 adhikansh desh ne antaheen sope apera ban chuki congress main ruchi lenaa band kar diya he
 Come Saturday, we will know if Congress can also work in its own interest

 First he beat both of them and then locked them in a room
 soochna milte hi police maukey par pahunchi or un donon ko baahar nikaala
 The matter is currently in the village panchayat
 yah ghatana bihar ke katihaar jile kii he
 Mansoor, a resident of Balia village in Manihari area, lives with his wife Farida (30)

 aaie jaanate hai swine flu se judi 5 afvaahon ke bare main
 1
 nahin ho saktaa ilaajayah ek afvaah he
 Swine flu is easily treated
 temiflu naam se swine flu kii dawa aati he jo is par teji se kaabo karti he
 Treatment should begin within 48 hours of symptoms appearing
 yah dawaai teji infections ko kam karti he
 Treatment should begin within the first 48 hours of swine flu
 paanch din kaa ilaaj hota he, jisamen marij ko temiflu di jaati he
 2
 bharat main he dawaai kii kamiaisa bilkul bhi nahin he
 According to a report, India now has more than 60 thousand doses
 iske alaava bacchon ke liye alag se ek hajaar syrup dose hai
 Pharma companies like Hetero, Natco and Strides Acrolab can manufacture more doses in a much shorter time
 3
 Swine flu occurs only once in life, it is an illusion
 yah jarur he ki ek baar aap H1N1 virus kii chapet main aakar ubarne ke baad aapkaa sharir bheetar hi us virus vishesh ke khilaaf pratirodhi takat paidaa karne kii koshish karata he
 But this does not mean that you will not get the virus infection again
 agar aap akasar sankramit logon ke sampark main aa rahe hai to aap dobaaraa-tibaara iske shikaar ho sakate hai
 However, there is also the option of vaccination that protects you from this virus for one year
 4
 Swine Flu Swine Flu is caused by eating pork, even if it is born from pigs, but its outbreak has nothing to do with eating or not eating pork
 H1N1 virus sabase zyada hawa ke jariye failata he
 When you cough or sneeze, fluid particles coming out of the mouth and nose fall into the air or on the ground or on any surface, it becomes vulnerable to the virus
 yah kan hawa ke jariye yaa kisi ke chune se duusare vyakti ke sharir main munh yaa naak ke jariye pravesh kar jate hai
 That is, the virus of swine flu can spread through any door, phone, keyboard, remote control, besides handshake and hug
 5
 Swine flu virus has become a mutation
 According to a week-old research by two major labs of India - National Institute of Virology Pune and National Center of Disease Control Delhi, the virus has not been mutated
 kisi jin ke diene main koi sthaayee parivartan hone kii prakriya ko biology main muteshan kehete hai
 It is not necessary that you inevitably take the virus in contact with every infected person
 kam immunity ke logon par H1N1 kaa shikaar hone kaa khatra zyada hota he
 Important symptoms of swine flu are fever of more than 101 degrees for more than three days
 saans lene main takalif, kaph, chaati main dard, susti, thakaan, ulti or bhukh kaa na laganaa bhi ise ahm lakshan hai

 In Chhattisgarh's Rajnandgaon district, the girl died in a borewell on Saturday at Shanwar
 paanch ghante ke abhiyaan ke baad bacchee ko jab borwell se baahar nikaala gaya, to uski maut ho chuki thi
 Rajnandgaon district collector Ashok Aggarwal said that a five-year-old girl, Khushboo Sahu, fell into the borewell at around 3 pm on Saturday afternoon in Mokhla village, about 17 km from the district headquarters
 bacchee ko surakshit baahar nikaalane ke liye paanch ghante tak prayaas kiya gaya, lekin bacchee ko nahin bachaaya ja sakaa
 Aggarwal said that Mushla village resident Harishchandra Sahu's five-year-old daughter Khushboo was playing near the house
 khilne ke dauraan vah pados ke khule borwell main gir gai
 When the family got information about it after the incident, the police were informed about it
 jaankaree milane ke baad jila prashasan ne bacchee ko bachaane kaa abhiyaan shuru kiya
 He said that a team of borewell experts and doctors reached Mokhla village to rescue the girl from Berwel and a rescue operation was started
 agarwal ne bataaya ki borwell lagbhag 30 foot gaharaa tha tathaa bacchee 13 foot kii gaharaai par fansi hui thi
 To remove the girl, it was decided to make a second pit close to the borewell and the work was started to build the pit with the help of JCB machine
 is dauraan doctoron ke dal ne bacchee ko pipe ke sahare oxygen pahunchane kaa kaam bhi shuru kar diya tha
 The girl was later taken out through a tunnel
 colector ne bataaya ki baahar nikaalane ke baad bacchee ko tatkaal jila aspataal rajanandgaanv ravaanaa kiya gaya, jahaan doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 Doctors feared that the girl died of shock and lack of oxygen immediately after falling into the borewell
 haalanki postmortem ke baad hi maut ke sahi kaarnon ke bare main jaankaree mil sakegi
 At present, Delhiites are not going to get rid of the heat

 According to the Meteorological Department, the temperature has increased on Monday

 In the afternoon in Delhi, the star has crossed 40 degrees
 haalanki bich-bich main badal bhi aa rahe hai, lekin garmi ke saath hi umas bhi bahut pareshaan kar rahi he
 It is estimated that the mercury may reach around 45 degrees by the end of this month

 But, on the occasion of sp's manifesto issue on Sunday afternoon, something happened that had never happened till date
 aisa pehali baar hua he jab sapa kaa ghoshnaa patr mulaayam singh yadav kii gairmaujuudagi main jari kiya gaya ho
 Mulayam Singh's chair was in the middle of the stage but, it remained empty
 mulaayam ko manaane ke liye akhilesh ne phone kiya, ajam khud unke ghar bhi gaye lekin netaa ji nahin aae
 Later, Akhilesh released the manifesto in his absence
 ghoshnaa patr jari karne ke dauraan mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke alaava unki patni or party kii saansad dimple yadav, varisht netaa kiranmay nanda or anya varisht netaa maujuud rahe
 Later when akhilesh-dimple reached Mulayam to issue a declaration letter to Mulayam, after the program, his son Akhilesh Yadav and his daughter-in-law Dimple Yadav persuaded him after the program and showed him the party's manifesto
 sapa netaa ajam khan vahaan pehle se hi maujuud the
 Akhilesh also shared a picture of his father on his social media
 Today’s manifesto takes forward the path of development we have done so far
 It further empowers the farmers, youth and the women of UP

 It is hoped that on Monday, Mulayam Singh Yadav can put his mind in front of everyone by press conference
 sutron ke mutabik mulaayam ke kuch kareebi un par areldi ke liye chunaav prachaar karne kaa dabaav bana rahe hai
 Let us tell you that the RLD has announced to contest all the seats in the state in these elections and has given the command of Sitapur district to Rampal Yadav, especially of Shivamoolayam and Shivpal
 mulaayam kii naaraazgi kahin is vajah se to nahinsutron ke mutabik mulaayam singh kaa maananaa rahaa he ki raajnneeti main matbhed hona chahie manabhed nahin
 But, the distance between Akhilesh and Shivpal is troubling him
 party ne jab ghoshnaa patr jari kiye tab manch par lage party ke poster se shivpal yadav kaa cheharaa gaayab tha
 The party has preferred only Akhilesh Yadav and Mulayam Singh's face on the poster
 aise main mana ja rahaa he samaajawaadee party shivpal yadav ke bina hi aage badhegi
 Uncle Shivpal also remained absent from the program of manifesto
 iske alaava unke manamafik ummidavaaro ke chunaav na hone or haal hi main sapa chhod basapa main shaamil hue apane khaas netaa ambika choudhary ke party chhodane se mulaayam singh naaraaz hai
 While Dr
 Gulrez Nizami, a faculty at Johar University, alleged that "today the police entered the University without telling the University Administration and locked the library inside
" is dauraan kisi ko bhi uniwarsity main jane kii ijaajat nahin di gai
 Later, the police took away a lot of books with them
 "ajam khan ke dream project mohammad ali johar uniwarsity par aaj achaanak baari police bal ke saath chapa maaraa gaya
 Police personnel in PAC trucks and about half a dozen vehicles rushed directly to Mumtaz Central Library inside the university and started searching the library

 Police had received information that hundreds of years old rare books stolen were suspected to be in the Central Library of Mohammad Ali Johar University
 police adheekshak ajay paal sharma ne bataaya ki madrasa aalia se chori gai kaaphi pustaken yahaan baraamad hui hai
 He said that these books are not mentioned anywhere in the register and records kept in the library of Johar University
 raksha rajya mantri mem pallam raju ne kaha ki pakistan dwaara simavarti kshetron main surang khodne kii khabaron par chintit hone kii jarurat nahin he
 Raju told reporters, "every country has the right to protect itself

 We do not need to worry about it
 ’’ media kii khabaron main kaha gaya tha ki pakistan bhartiya seemaa ke paas apane punjab praant ke sargodha main surangen khod rahaa he
 The report said that these tunnels were not going towards any road, due to which it is suspected that these nuclear weapons or missiles are being prepared for safe keeping
 pakistan ke parmaanu hathiyaaron ke galat hathiyaaron main padane ke khatre ke bare main unhone kaha ‘‘hamen aashaa he ki pakistan sarkaar inke galat haathon main padane se rokane ke liye paryaapt kadam uthaa rahi he

 '' purv vaidic kaal ke ve rishi nishchay hi tejasvi rahe honge jinhone sanskrit jaisi samrudh bhashaa rachi
 In spite of its many disparities, a part of Vedic literature is a precious part of the world's tradition of knowledge and philosophy
 panini jaise udbhat vaiyaakaran ne 2500 saal pehle 4000 sutron jaisi 'ashtaadhi' rach daali thi or vyakaran ke niyam nirdhaarit kiye the, yah soch kar bhi vismay hota he
 After him Sanskrit produced great poets like Kalidasa and wonderful playwrights like Shudraka
 ramayana or mahabharat jaise granth is bhashaa main likhe gaye jo duniya main apni tarah ke adwitiya granth hai
 But what happened that such a unique unique language almost reached the brink of extinction in chronology? Who were those people who tied Sanskrit in such shackles of religion and purity that all its liveliness suffocated? Who were the people who sought to punish Shambuk for reading the Vedas, and whose dominion Rama, who was called Maryada Purushottama, also bowed down? Actually, the Shambuk slaughter also begins the narrative of Sanskrit slaughter
 jin logon ne tay kiya ki sanskrit dharm or varna ke aadhaar par bas kuch logon kaa visheshadhikaar rahegi, unhone sanskrit kaa smritilekh tabhi likh diya
 People deprived of Sanskrit created different languages for themselves - after all, the work of any society does not work without language
 katha ke mutabik shanbuk ko isliye maaraa gaya ki ek brahman kaa mrit betaa ji sake
 Shambuk did not die, the Brahmin's son continued to live by killing Sanskrit
 dhire-dhire vah ashuddh bhashaa main abujh mantra padhate panditon ke paakhand kii bhashaa hoti chali gai
 When Buddha and Mahavira happened, they considered this language inadequate for themselves
 unhone lok tak pahunchane ke liye paali kaa sahaara liya
 Languages continued to advance - Pali, Prakrit, Apabhransh, Awadhi, Braj continued to form a big tradition
 ramakatha ab valmiki ramayana kii mohataaj nahin rahi, vah tulsi kii ramcharita maanas ke sahare jan-jan tak pahunch pai
 If you want, you can remember that in Benares itself, the ideological ancestors of today's miscreants tried to stop Tulsidas from writing Ramcharitmanas in the public language
 amritlal nagar kaa upanyaas 'maanas ke hans' vistaar main bataata he ki kaise tulsi kii pandulipi ko jalaane kii koshish hui or tulsidas banaras se ayodhya aane-jane ko majaboor hue
 Similarly, Surdas and Rasakhan saved the story of Krishna

 He was mentioned in the travelogue accounts of Hieun Tsang and Magasthenes

 If there were no European scholars like Max Müller in modern times, then this rich tradition of language would not have been known
 is lihaaj sanskrit kii parampara ko angrejon kaa abhaari hona chahie ki unhone gyaan kii yah sampada bachaa lee
 Today's truth is that Sanskrit is the language lying in the Sanskrit departments and archives of universities
 kuch tolon main kisi zid kii tarah yah bhale boli jaati ho, lekin vah kisi bhi pradesh kii bhashaa nahin he
 Even most scholars citing Sanskrit literature are seen taking help of their English translations in place of the original Sanskrit text
 sanskrit pathan-pathan ke naam par ek lunjpunj samskruti viksit ho gai he
 Those who see the difference between Aryan and Aryan in Sanskrit and Feroz Khan do not even know that Sanskrit and Persian are languages of the same family in terms of philology
 bhaaropee kahalaane vaale is bhashik parivaar ke strot or sutara aapas main is tarah milte hai ki achraj hota he
 There are words like 'brother', 'biradar' and 'bhatru' found in English, Persian and Sanskrit or the consistency like 'doter', 'dukhtar' and 'duhita', or 'century', 'sadi' or 'shatabdi' Like 'census' - This relationship is very large and extends very far
 darasal samajhane kii baat bas yahi he ki bhashaaen hon yaa samskritiyaan- ve aapas main mil jul hi vistrut hoti hai, lambii umr paati hai
 The urge for blood purity proves fatal for them
 vaise bhi sabhyataa main raktashuddhta ek tarah kaa myth he
 Of course, languages also get the power of their power, but they remain and continue to spread because they mix with each other and earn new life and meaning
 aksar sanskrit ko bhartiya bhashaaon kii mata kehane vaale bhul jate hai ki sanskrit nani yaa parnani bhale ho, mata nahin he
 There are many beams in the middle which have got water from many rivers
 jo hindi aaj ham bolte hai, use khadi boli ke rup main khadaa karne kaa kaam sabase pehle amir khusro ne kiya
 The shadow of Arabic and Persian on this Hindi is so large that the inclusion of Sanskrit in it often looks artificial
 angreji kaa vikaas duniya bhar kii bhashaaon ke shabd lekar hua he- yah jaanane ke liye bahut vidwaan hone kii zarurat nahin he
 In the current Sanskrit atmosphere, a teacher like Firoz Khan comes and opens a window of a suffocated room
 lekin yah tazaa hawaaen shaayad ab bhi un logon ko manzur nahin jinhone ek andhere main rahane kaa abhyaas viksit kar liya he or chaahate hai ki sara samaaj isi andhere kii ore bade
 Of course, they do not have much number, but they feel that they have the strength of the ideology of today's power which seeks to establish the fake tradition of glorification of the past as synonymous with the entire Indian tradition
 lekin banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay main firoz khan sanskrit kii parampara padhaayenge to vah parampara samrudh hi hogi
 Kamil Bulke, who studied Ramakatha, gave Ramakatha new horizons
 unki isiyat isamen aade nahin ai
 The history of the Sanskrit and religion, to those who are arrogant of the superiority, finally dusts the history - it tells the condition of Sanskrit itself
 lekin shanbuk vadh kii raajnneeti aaj bhi jari he- bina yah samajhe ki shanbuk phir paidaa ho jaaenge, sanskrit peeche chhootati jaaegi
 The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a petition challenging the validity of Article 370 of the Constitution granting special state status to Jammu and Kashmir
 supreme court centre or rajya sarkaar ke anurodh par is yachika kii sunwaayee april main karegaa
 Attorney General KK Venugopal on behalf of the Central Government objected that the situation in the state is not right at this time, so the hearing in this case should be postponed for some time
 unhone kaha ki maujuuda halaat bahut hi samvedansheel hai
 To this, a bench of Justice Dhananjay y Chandrachud and Justice MR Shah said that it would hear the case in the first week of April 2019
 atorni general ne kaha, 'rajya main raajnneetik sthiti aisi he ki jisamen is maamle kii sunwaayee nahin kii jaani chahie
 During the hearing of this case, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi and advocate Shoaib Alam appeared on behalf of Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki rajya main nau charnon main chal rahe panchayat chunaavon kii vajah se sunwaayee sthagit karne ke liye patr diya gaya he
 On this, the Supreme Court bench said that the matter can be attached with petitions challenging the legality of Article 35A
 anuchhed 35e rajya main sthai nagarikon ko vishesh adhikaar or suvidhaayen pradaan karne se sambandhit he
 State government lawyers opposed the suggestion that the two issues are mutually exclusive and should not engage this petition with the already pending petitions
 iske baad bench ne yah yachika april ke pehle saptaah ke liye soochibaddh kar di
 The Supreme Court of India said on April 3 during the hearing on the appeal of Vijayalakshmi Jha that Article 370 of the Constitution is not a temporary provision
 vijayalakshmi jha ne dilli hai court ke 11 april 2017 ke faisle ke khilaaf apil daayar kar rakhi he
 The petitioner claimed in the High Court that Article 370 was a temporary provision which ended with the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly in 1957
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne shanivaar ko khulaasa kiya ki bharat ne ji-8 or ji-5 ke prabhaavshaalee deshon se kaha he ki ve aatankwaad ke khilaaf karrwai karne or bharat ke saath mitrataa kaa vikalp chunane ke liye pakistan par dabaav daalen
 He also said that he hoped Pakistan would agree to bring the Mumbai "massacre" conspirators to justice in a meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani in Egypt next week and allow terrorism against India from their soil
 Will not give bharat 25 saal se aatankwaad kaa peedit rahaa heitaly main ji-8 or ji-5 shikhar baithak main shaamil hone ke baad swadesh vaapasi ke raste main manmohan ne samvaadadaataaon se baat karte hue kaha ki unhone pakistan kii dharti se bharat ke khilaaf sanchalit hone vaale aatankwaad kaa mudda audyogic deshon or ubhar rahi arthvyavasthaaon ke saamne uthaaya
 Manmohan said, "wherever i spoke to the leaders of the G-8 and G-5 forums, it was accepted by us that India has been a victim of terrorism for the last 25 years and there is a lot of evidence that it operates from Pakistan
 hamaari sabhi netaaon se apil he or hamane unase pakistan par dabaav banane ke liye kaha he taaki vah aatankwaad kaa rasta chhodkar bharat ke saath mitrataa kaa rasta apanaae tathaa bharat ke saath sambandhon ko aage badaye
 "the Prime Minister said this in response to a question
 unase poocha gaya ki kya pichley maheene rus ke yekaterinburg main unki paak raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari se hui mulaakaat ke baad bharat kii maangon par pakistan kii ore se kuch ‘‘sakaaratmak’’ hua he or kya bharat islamabad par vahaan se sanchalit ho rahe aatankwaad ke khilaaf antarrashtriya dabaav banaae jane kii maang kar rahaa he
 "we will do everything necessary to resolve the pending issues", on behalf of Pakistan, India was asked to inform New Delhi about the action against the conspirators of the Mumbai attacks
 manmohan ne kaha ‘‘un lambit muddon ke samaadhaan ke liye ham har jaruri cheez karenge jinaki vajah se donon deshon ke sambandh bigade hai lekin iske liye yah pramaan die jane kii jarurat he ki islamabad aatankwaadiyon se nipatega jo apni sari urja bharat ko pareshaan or asthir karne ke liye kharch karte hai
 He said that he expected to exchange views on meeting Gilani on the sidelines of the non-aligned Conference in Egypt
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ‘‘yadi pakistan mumbai narsanhaar ke shadyantrkariyon ko nyaay ke kathghare main laata he or aatankwaadiyon ko bharat ke khilaaf apni jameen kaa istemaal nahin karne detaa he to hamen sambandhon ko saamaanya karne kii disha main aadhi se adhik duuri tay ho jane kii ummid he
 In Yekaterinburg, Manmohan gave a strong message to Zardari in front of the media, saying that he has got the mandate to tell that Pakistan needs to take action against terrorism operating against India from its soil

 After this Satyavrat Chaturvedi and Anand Sharma also stood up in their seats and sought answers from the Central Government on this issue
 congressi netaaon ne prashnkaal nahin chalane diya
 Anand Sharma also demanded the arrest of Vedic

 Any reaction on Social Media? Did he go as an Envoy of NDA Govt or as a personal Envoy of PM? centre sarkaar kaa hafiz-vaidic mulaakaat se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 However, members of Congress were not satisfied with Jaitley's reply and started the commotion again
 congress sadasyon ke hangaame ke kaaran rajyasabha kii baithak dopaher 12 baje tak ke liye sthagit kerani padi
 Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said that the Congress has obstructed the Rajya Sabha without giving notice to the government
 isse congress kii gambhirtha kaa andaja lagata he
 Javadekar said, 'since Arun Jaitley has made a statement in the House on behalf of the government, the Congress should calm down on this issue
 congress aatankwaad ke masale kaa raajnneetikaran kar rahi he
 When Gilani met Hafiz Saeed, he should answer what the UPA government had done at the time
 'mumbai hamale ke aaropee hafiz said se pakistan jaakar mulaakaat karke varisht bhartiya patrkaar veda pratap vaidic us vakt ghir gaye jab hafiz said ke saath unki mulaakaat kii tasviren saamne ain
 When the matter was raised, Vedic said that he had met Saeed as a journalist

 Now everyone's eyes are on Pakistan's army and Kiyani's attitude about what they are going to do next
 haalanki gilaani bharosa jataa rahe hai ki jamhuriyat ko koi khatra nahin he, lekin sarkaar or sena ke bich takaraav kaaphi tikhaa he
 On Wednesday evening, Gilani sacked Pakistan Defense Secretary Naeem Lodi, believed to be close to Kiani
 unhone supreme court main halafanama diya tha ki sena sarkaar ke maatahat nahin he
 However, this dismissal has also been challenged in the Lahore High Court
 rawalpindi kii ek unit ke ek commander ko bhi hataaya ja chukaa he
 According to experts, this is an attempt to cut down on Kiyani
 lekin kiyani akele nahin hai, unke saath iesai bhi he
 Gilani's objection has been not just on Kiyani but also on the statement of ISI chief Lt Gen Shuja Pasha
 iesai ne baqayada kaha he, "mananeey pradhanmantri ne jo kuch bhi sena pramukh or iesai ke mahanideshak ko lekar kaha he, usase sangeen aarope kuch or nahin ho saktaa
 This will have very serious consequences, which can have a significant impact on the country
 " It is clearly an attempt to threaten the elected government and also to remind that the Army and ISI have been deciding the fate of Pakistan
 is hausale ko kuch takat is baat se bhi mil rahi he ki gilaani or jaradaari kii jodi har taraf se sawaalon se ghiri he
 It is being told that the army may refuse to work with the new Defense Secretary Nargis Sethi

 The question is, what will happen next, will the old army regain or will Pakistan win, because the attack on the inefficiency and corruption of the current government of Pakistan is all-round

 No other government has caused so much destruction
 imran kii sabhaaon main in dinon umadti bheed bhi bataati he ki unki lokapriyata badi he
 Surveys are also pointing this way, but the important thing is that this time Imran is not alone
 unke peeche musharraf bhi khadey hai, isliye vah kisi or talmail se inkaar kar rahe hai
 Not only Gilani and Zardari, but former prime minister Nawaz Sharif is also on his target
 tippaniyan The positive side of the ongoing agitations in Pakistan is that everyone is talking about elections there

 The latest attack has been done by Imran Khan, who has the support of the old dictator Pervez Musharraf
 taharik-e-insaaf ke sadar or jane−maane cricket khilaadi imran khan ne aaj phir sarkaar ke khilaaf aag ugali or kaha ki gilaani or jaradaari kii jodi ne desh ko tabah kar diya he
 Imran said that thieves are the source of the thieves in the country and under the guise of Jhamuriyat, they are being robbed and these people are creating property and wealth
 itani tabaahi kisi or sarkaar ne nahin machaai
 The crowds in Imran's meetings these days also show that his popularity has increased
 survey bhi isi taraf ishaara kar rahe hai, lekin ahm baat yah he ki is baar imran akele nahin hai
 Musharraf is also standing behind him, so he is refusing any further coordination
 unke nishane par gilaani or jaradaari hi nahin purv pradhanmantri navaj sharif bhi hai
 The comments pakistan main chal rahi hulchalon kaa sakaaratmak paksh bas yahi he ki har koi vahaan chunaav kii baat kar rahaa he
 Zardari said this in the meeting of Pakistan People's Party, Nawaz Sharif has also demanded early elections and now Imran also said that the country is standing with no military force
 udhar, general kiyani kii mushkil yah bhi he ki log sarkaar se chaahe kitna bhi tang hon, fouj ke saath nahin hai
 In such a situation, a lot depends on the stand of the Supreme Court, which has watered Gilani and Zardari
 imran kii party bhi supreme court ke chif justise iftikhar choudhary kaa samarthan hasil karne kii koshish main he
 This creates confidence that whatever will come out of Surat will come out of Jamhooriyat

 yah kaha he tambaakoo adhinium ke praavdhaanon par vichaar kar rahi ek sansadeey samiti ke pramukh ne
 The statement comes at a time when India is about to postpone its April 1 deadline to increase the size of warnings on tobacco products due to pressure from several lobbies
 ‘tambaakoo or anya tambaakoo utpaada adhinium, 2003’ ke praavdhaanon ke pareekshan ke liye gathit ek sansadeey samiti ke pramukh dilip gandhi ne somvaar ko kaha ki tambaakoo se cancer hone sambandhi sabhi adhyayan videshon main hue hai or kisi ko bhartiya pariprekshya ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 a parliamentary committee led by Gandhi, a BJP MP from Maharashtra, has made a 'serious' demand from the government to stop its proposal to increase the size of warnings printed on tobacco packets from 40 percent to 85 percent
 gandhi ne kah, ‘tambaakoo ke hanikaarak prabhaavon par sabhi ekamat hai
 There is no Indian research to prove that consumption of tobacco causes cancer
 cancer sirf tambaakoo ke kaaran nahin hota he
 We have to study the Indian perspective, because in states like Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, the livelihood of four crore people goes from making beedis to Tendupatta
 ’unhone kaha, samiti ne in chetavaniyon ko us vakt tak roke rakhane ko kaha he jab tak bhartiya pariprekshya main ise dekh na liya jaae
 It should not be based on foreign studies

 in dilli metro ke musafiron ko ek or jhatka lagane vaala he, kyonki oktober main ek baar phir metro kaa kiraaya badhane ja rahaa he
 The new fare of the metro will be effective from October 3 and if we talk about the increase, then the maximum fare of the metro will be doubled in October compared to May this year
 haalanki dmarsi kaa kahana he ki kiraaya badhaane kaa faisla nayaa nahin he or yah may main hi tay kar liya gaya tha ki ek oktober se nayaa kiraaya lagu hoga
 The increased fare of the metro was to be implemented from the beginning of October but due to the concessional fare in the metro on October 1 and 2, the new fare will be applicable from October 3
 bade hue kiraaye kaa pehla fez lagu hone se pehle metro kaa nunatam kiraaya 8 rupye hota tha, jo ab das rupye hoga
 Whereas the maximum fare was 30 rupees, which was increased to 50 rupees in May and now after October 3 it will be 60 rupees
 pichley chaar maheene ke bheetar hi metro kaa kiraaya sau fisadi bad jayega
 Not only this, for a distance of 5 to 12 kilometers, the fare now is 15 rupees, which will be 20 rupees from October 3
 jabaki itani hi duuri ke liye may ke pehle metro kaa kiraaya mahaz 12 rupye tha
 For a distance of 12 to 21 km, till now the metro charges 30 rupees, which will now be 40 rupees
 jabaki isi duuri ke liye may ke pehle adhiktam 21 rupye kiraaya hota tha
 Traveling in metro from 21 to 32 km from metro now has to pay 40 rupees fare, but from October it will be 50 rupees
 jabaki may ke pehle itani hi duuri ke liye kiraaya 25 rupye hua karata tha
 Now, if you travel more than 32 kilometers, you have to pay 50 rupees as fare, but from October the same fare will be 60 rupees, whereas before May it used to be 30 rupees
 dilli metro ne kiraaye ke slab kam kar die he, isse bhi kam duuri tak safar karne waalon par bhi kiraaya badhotaree kii zyada maar padegi, jabaki adhiktam kiraaya doguna ho hi gaya he
 However, according to DMRC, people can travel on concessional rates in the metro on vacation days
 chuttee vaale din metro kaa nunatam kiraaya to 10 rupye hi hoga, jabaki adhiktam kiraaya 50 rupye vasula jayega

 i want to say that this is due to the language of English
 jaise hindi main ham shri krishna kehete hai jabaki angreji main krishna likhte hai
 Such small things should not be caught
 sonu ne media se kaha choti baton ko mat pakadie, muddon ko samajhie
 When Sonu Nigam was asked why he was getting his hair cut, he told the media that i am not doing this to embarrass anyone or prove my point
 main jo kar rahaa hum vah kisi ke liye misaal banane ke liye nahin he
 i am going to shave my hair and a Muslim will cut my hair (aalim Hakeem)
 main muslim ke khilaaf nahin hum
 i am very secular

 Parents were upset since yesterday, saying that the form of Mathematics is rotating in whatsapp University, is it right? hamaara jawaab yahi tha ki pariksha se pehle ham kaise kah sakate hai ki ye vahi prashn patr he
 Perhaps they came out right, the CBSE had to decide that the exam of 10th is canceled
 ganit kaa paper vaise hi tanaav paidaa kar detaa he, kai chaatr iske tanaav ko handle nahin kar pate hai isliye isaki pariksha ant main rakhi jaati he taaki iske asar se baaki parikshaayen kharaab na ho jaaen
 The parents are thinking of going to court, demanding a fair investigation

 The recruitment of Rajasthan Police constable in Rajasthan could not stop the rigging of the examination, the examination had to be canceled
 koi naaraaz nahin hua
 In Uttar Pradesh, the Police Recruitment and Promotion Board conducted the examination of computer operators and clerks, in a district, due to a few questions, the hope of millions of youth was dashed
 koi naaraaz hua tha, isaki soochna hamen nahin he, magar isaki he ki saadhaaran pariwaron ke ve noujvaan bheetar se tut chuke hai

 isiilie kahata hum ki isse pehle aglaa chunaav inhen dangon se nikle mudde par hone lage, pehle tay kar lijie, bacchon ko dangai bananaa he ki doctor bananaa he
 If you want to make a doctor, then ask why there is theft in the examination everywhere
 na bhopal main na patna main or na dilli main kahin bhi eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha nahin he
 You must have seen in Delhi
 jab esayssi ke chaatr pariksha vyavastha main dhaandhlee ko lekar kai dinon tak dilli main dharne par baithe rahe
 There was an attempt to break their dharna through political, sometimes they were told the hand of the coaching mafia and sometimes something but these students were saying that honest examination system is needed
 esayssi kii parikshaon main jo dhaandhlee ho rahi he uski jaanch sibiai se ho or supreme court nigaraanee kare
 The SSC did not pay any attention to this, but later, when the movement intensified, some examinations had to be canceled
 ab ye chaatr phir se 31 march ko dilli aa rahe hai
 Then you will open the TV and see which channel pays attention to their demand
 staff salection kamishan kii pariksha main dhaandhlee hone or uske baad andolan se hi sibiesai ko satark ho janaa chahie tha
 SSC also did not pay attention at first but later believed that it could be leaked and the examination of 21 February had to be canceled
 chaatr maang kar rahe hai ki dobaaraa se hogi

 hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger kii report kaa yah hissaa he
 Mukesh Singh Sengar says that these people had built about 15 computer labs in Gandhi Vihar
 yaheen se online sawaalon kaa jawaab taiyaar kiya jaataa tha
 They are passing these jobs for 15 lakh rupees from each student
 police ke mutabik ye log 180 chaatro ke paper salve kar chuke hai
 Now if you multiply it by 15 lakhs, then this amount is up to 27 crores
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki isamen bade bade log bhi shaamil honge
 According to the police, SSC has given the tender for the examinations to a company called SIFY
 uske bhi karmchaaree is khel main shaamil ho sakate hai
 So, was there no merit in the demand of the students that SSC examination is being rigged
 aaj hi akhabaaron main carmik rajya mantri jitendra singh kaa bayaan aayaa he ki esayssi kambind graduate level 2017 kii pariksha dobaaraa nahin hogi
 Its question does not arise
 ek taraf dilli police esayssi kii pariksha main online sawaal hal karne ke giroh ko pakad rahi he, duusari taraf mantri kah rahe hai ki dobaaraa pariksha kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota he kyonki esayssi sijiel 2017 kii pariksha main prashn patron ke li hone kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota he
 Jitendra Singh has given this answer in writing in the Lok Sabha
 mantri ji kaa likhit jawaab kuch he, duusari taraf dilli police pariksha li karaane ke maamle main 4 logon ko giraftaar bhi kar rahi he
 We also did full prime time on August 1, 2017, when news channels were playing games in the project of rioting your children by showing Hindu Muslim debates
 abhi aapane dekha hoga ki cobra post ne ek sting oparation kiya he
 People of the channel are raising Hindu Muslim debates with money
 sahi puuchhie to prashn patron ke li hone ke maamle main dilli police acha kaam kar rahi he
 Since last year, we have been tracking the success of Delhi Police in this case
 aapako pataa hoga ki kai privet companiyaan jinaki sankhya darjan se zyaada he ab paise lekar pariksha kaa aayojan kara rahi hai
 One such company was awarded the contract to conduct the post graduate examination of National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET)
 yah amareeki company he
 It had assumed before the Delhi Police that one could hack the examination system
 tab bhi hamane sawaal uthaaya tha ki kya ham ek eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha nahin bana sakate hai
 Delhi Police has prepared the charge sheet very diligently
 noida, chandigarh main chaape maare, chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya magar afsos baaki police aisa kaam nahin kar saki
 In this case, Anand Rai, who fought the case in the case of rigging the medical entrance examination in Madhya Pradesh, had filed a petition in the court
 ye ek or he
 The government itself does not fight cases on behalf of students in such cases, some Anand Rai has to come forward, risk has to be taken
 aaj tak chori ho rahi he jabaki madhya pradesh ke vyapam ghotaale kaa ham vibhats rup dekh chuke hai
 a charge sheet has been filed against 592 people in Vyapam
 200 ke khilaaf arest warrant he
 You can read the report of the slowing down of this investigation on The Wire Hindi website
 ye sab hone ke baad bhi aaj tak har jagah vyapam jari he
 Have you ever thought that when these students pass the 12th and go towards the college, where will they go there
 kabhi aapane rajyon main collejon kii haalat dekhi he, vahaan shikshak hai yaa nahin, ye pataa kiya he, pataa kar lijie phir skool kii padhai ko lekar tension kiijie
 Colleges are not good for your children
 netaaon ne collejon ko barbaad kar diya he
 If you are not sure, then tell me the state, i can show it by coming there
 uniwarsity series main aapane dekha hoga college ke kamlej kabad main badal chuke hai
 There are some colleges left, there are new problems knocking
 jab aap yah khabar sunate hai ki sarkaar ab collejon se kahegi ki 100 main 70 rupaya denge magar 30 rupee kaa intazaam aapako khud karnaa hoga, lone lenaa hoga, uskaa byaaz dena hoga to kya aap samaj pate hai ki is faisle kaa aapaki zindagi par kya asar padegaa
 There has been a strike for a week in Delhi University regarding these questions but there is no discussion anywhere
 tippaniyan On 28 March, thousands of teachers and students again descended on the streets of Delhi
 inamen dilli vishvavidhyalay ke adhiktar collejon ke shikshak sangh or chaatro kaa sanghathan isa, esefai sivaiesus, kevaies vagairah shaamil the
 Teachers and students of Jamia Millia Islamia, Teachers Association and Students of JNU, Teachers and Students of Aligarh Muslim University joined this march
 mandi house lekar sansad maarg tak yah march niklaa he
 Staff organizations of these colleges have also participated
 chaatro or shikshakon ke liye aaj kaa din bada din tha
 The march was called by Fedakuta and Duta, representing 40 universities
 inkaa kahana he ki 27 march ko ujisi ne saaf kiya he ki jinaki selary ujisi or maanav sansaadhan mantralay se aati he, jinhen saatven vetan ayog ke tahat badhaayaa gaya he use centre sarkaar puraa karegi
 This is a victory, but the same has not been said for the employees and teachers of the universities of the states
 jiske virodh ko lekar yah march niklaa he
 There are several issues involved
 shikshakon ke pension ke maamle ko lekar koi faisla nahin hua
 Thousands of Adhak teachers also joined this march on their appointment
 swaittata kaa mudda to tha hi
 Recently, JNU teachers and students took out a march from JNU to Parliament to protest against the decision of the Ministry of Human Resources
 desh bhar ke collejon kii haalat bahut hi karaab he
 So much so that if you look at the 27 points of my university series, the food will not be digested
 jitna bhaashan ramanavami ke juluus ko lekar he, utana bhaashan collejon kii khasta haalat ko lekar nahin he
 Gradually higher education will be expensive, so how can parents who earn 40-50 thousand from the poor send their children to college
 awwal to rajya ke rajya main ek bhi college ab dhang kaa nahin bachaa he
 There is a shortage of teachers
 susheel mahapatra or amitesh ne is raily main aae chaatro se jaananaa chaha ki unke bich in sawaalon ko lekar kisi samaj he
 a lift man from Amitesh said that JNU people keep on performing, when Amitesh told that they are doing this so that when your children can get good and cheap education when they go to college, then they look around
 dharna bana di gai he magar jab tathy saamne rakhe jate hai to jawaab dete nahin banataa he
 Today, a young man has written a letter from BR Ambedkar Bihar University that the results of several thousand students have been stuck for a year, that too due to the university
 us bihar main jahaan netaa naujavaanon ko dangon kii taraf haank rahe hai
 The basic question of our job and exam series is to decide whether to make a child riot or a doctor
 sibiesai ko 10veen kii ganit kii pariksha or 12veen kii arthshaastra kii pariksha radd kerani padi he
 Parents were upset since yesterday, saying that the form of Mathematics is rotating in whatsapp University, is it right? hamaara jawaab yahi tha ki pariksha se pehle ham kaise kah sakate hai ki ye vahi prashn patr he
 Perhaps they came out right, the CBSE had to decide that the exam of 10th is canceled
 ganit kaa paper vaise hi tanaav paidaa kar detaa he, kai chaatr iske tanaav ko handle nahin kar pate hai isliye isaki pariksha ant main rakhi jaati he taaki iske asar se baaki parikshaayen kharaab na ho jaaen
 The parents are thinking of going to court, demanding a fair investigation
 lakhon gharon main is vakt koharaam machaa hua he
 Recently, a report by Ritika Chopra of Indian Express was published
 ensiiarti ne ek neshnal achievement survey karaayaa he
 There are 22 lakh students surveyed in 700 districts across the country
 teesri se aathvin kaksha ke chaatro main ganit ke sawaalon ke jawaab dene kii kshamta main baari giravat ai he
 If you look at the math results in the board of UP Bihar Madhya Pradesh, you will know how stressful this one subject has made the examination and studies
 aise main agar prashn patr li hone lage, whatsap haath se likhaa prashn ghoomane lage tab aap sochie pichley do dinon main maa baap or bacchon par kya beeti hogi
 Many parents have emailed who will take responsibility for our child who will go through stress
 mere mobile par maharashtra ke jalgaanv se ek number baar baar flash kar rahaa tha
 We picked up there was a tenth class girl, there was anger in the voice, also despair
 uske apane sawaal the to hamane kaha ki video ricard karke bhej do
 The Prime Minister has spoken to HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar
 aisa sutron kaa kahana he
 The question papers of examinations are leaking across the country, no one addresses their concerns
 magar yahaan maamla us middle class kaa he, un sibiesai skulon kaa he, isliye pradhanmantri kii sakriyata bhi ullekhneey he
 Sources reveal that Prime Minister Modi is angry with the question paper leaking
 bihar main daaroga kii pariksha main prashn patr li hone ko lekar kai jagahon par chaatro ne pradarshan kiya, use lekar koi naaraaz nahin hua
 The recruitment of Rajasthan Police constable in Rajasthan could not stop the rigging of the examination, the examination had to be canceled
 koi naaraaz nahin hua
 In Uttar Pradesh, the Police Recruitment and Promotion Board conducted the examination of computer operators and clerks, in a district, due to a few questions, the hope of millions of youth was dashed
 koi naaraaz hua tha, isaki soochna hamen nahin he, magar isaki he ki saadhaaran pariwaron ke ve noujvaan bheetar se tut chuke hai
 Many exam results do not come even in two to three years, till date there was no resentment about it
 chhapra main je pi uniwarsity or bihar uniwarsity main lakhon chaatr teen saal kaa bie paanch se saat saal main kar rahe hai, na pradhanmantri naaraaz hue na mukhyamantri naaraaz ho rahe hai
 At BR Ambedkar Bihar University in 2017, there was no examination, no resentment
 isliye naaraazgi kii khabaron se behatar he ki ham in pariksha vyavastha ko thik se dekhen jise lekar pichley teen maheene se sara kaam chhodkar naukari series kar rahaa hum, magar usase bhi koi naaraaz nahin hua
 Lakhs of students are waiting for results in Bihar, but you know what is happening there
 isiilie kahata hum ki isse pehle aglaa chunaav inhen dangon se nikle mudde par hone lage, pehle tay kar lijie, bacchon ko dangai bananaa he ki doctor bananaa he
 If you want to make a doctor, then ask why there is theft in the examination everywhere
 na bhopal main na patna main or na dilli main kahin bhi eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha nahin he
 You must have seen in Delhi
 jab esayssi ke chaatr pariksha vyavastha main dhaandhlee ko lekar kai dinon tak dilli main dharne par baithe rahe
 There was an attempt to break their dharna through political, sometimes they were told the hand of the coaching mafia and sometimes something but these students were saying that honest examination system is needed
 esayssi kii parikshaon main jo dhaandhlee ho rahi he uski jaanch sibiai se ho or supreme court nigaraanee kare
 The SSC did not pay any attention to this, but later, when the movement intensified, some examinations had to be canceled
 ab ye chaatr phir se 31 march ko dilli aa rahe hai
 Then you will open the TV and see which channel pays attention to their demand
 staff salection kamishan kii pariksha main dhaandhlee hone or uske baad andolan se hi sibiesai ko satark ho janaa chahie tha
 SSC also did not pay attention at first but later believed that it could be leaked and the examination of 21 February had to be canceled
 chaatr maang kar rahe hai ki dobaaraa se hogi
 Today it is news from Delhi that Delhi Police has arrested four people in the SSC Lower Division Clerk examination paper leak case

 Mathematics paper causes stress in the same way, many students are not able to handle its stress, so its exam is kept in the end so that its effect does not spoil the other exams
 mata pita court main jane kii soch rahe hai, nishpaksh jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 There is chaos in millions of homes at this time
 haal hi main indian express kii ruthika chopra kii ek report chhapi thi
 NCERT has conducted a National Achievement Survey
 desh bhar ke 700 zilon main 22 lakh chaatro kaa survey hua he
 There is a steep decline in the ability to answer mathematics questions among third to eighth grade students
 aap upi bihar madhya pradesh ke board main ganit kaa riselt dekhie pataa chalegaa ki is ek vishay ne pariksha or padhai ko kitna tanaavpurn bana diya he
 In such a situation, if the question paper started leaking, whatsapp hand written question started to rotate, then think about what would have happened to parents and children in the last two days
 kai maa baap ne email kiya he ki hamaara baccha jo tanaav se guzaregaa uski zimmedaari koun legaa
 a number was repeatedly flashing from Jalgaon in Maharashtra on my mobile
 hamane uthaaya to udhar se ek dasvin class kii ladki thi, awaz main gussa bhi tha, maayusi bhi thi
 If he had his own questions, we said that record the video and send it
 pradhanmantri ne maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar se baat kii he
 Sources say so
 desh bhar main parikshaon ke prashn patr li ho rahe hai, unki chintaa ko koi sambodhit nahin karata he
 But here the matter is of that middle class, of those CBSE schools, so the activism of the Prime Minister is also notable
 sutara bataate hai ki pradhanmantri modi prashn patr li hone se naaraaz hai
 In Bihar, students protested at the place in question for leaking of question paper, there was no resentment about it
 rajasthan main rajasthan police sipaahi kii bhartee pariksha main dhaandhlee nahin roak pai, pariksha radd kerani pad gai
 There was no resentment
 uttar pradesh main police bhartee va pronnati board ne computer oparator or lipic kii pariksha kaa aayojan kiya, ek zile main kuch prashnon kii gadabadi ke kaaran lakhon naujavaanon kii ummid par pani phir gaya
 We are not angry that we are not aware of it, but it is that those young people of ordinary families have broken up inside
 kai parikshaon ke riselt do se teen saal main bhi nahin aate hai, use lekar aaj tak koi naaraaz nahin hua
 In Chhapra, lakhs of students at JP University and Bihar University are doing a three-year BA in five to seven years, neither the Prime Minister is angry nor the Chief Minister is angry
 bi aar ambedkar bihar uniwarsity main 2017 main koi pariksha hi nahin hui, koi naaraaz nahin hua
 Therefore, it is better to get angry with the news of resentment that we should look at these examination system properly, leaving all the work for the last three months and doing a job series, but it did not make anyone angry either
 bihar main lakhon chaatr riselt kaa intazaar kar rahe hai magar vahaan kya ho rahaa he aap pataa kiijie
 That is why i say that before the next elections start on the issue arising out of these riots, first decide, children have to be rioted that they have to be doctors
 doctor bananaa he to puuchhie ki har jagah pariksha main chori kyon ho rahi he
 There is no honest examination system in Bhopal nor in Patna nor anywhere in Delhi
 aapane dilli main dekha hoga
 When the students of SSC sat on a dharna in Delhi for several days about rigging in the examination system
 inke dharne ko raajnneetik ke zarie todane kaa prayaas hua, kabhi koching mafia kaa haath bataaya gaya to kabhi kuch magar ye chaatr yahi to kah rahe the ki eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha chahie
 The rigging in the SSC examinations should be investigated by the CBI and the Supreme Court should monitor it
 inaki baat par esayssi ne bhi dhyaan nahin diya magar baad main jab andolan tej hua to kuch parikshaayen radd kerani padin
 Now these students are coming to Delhi again on 31 March
 tab aap tivi khol kar dekhiegaa ki inaki maang par koun sa channel dhyaan detaa he
 CBSE should have been alerted to the rigging of the Staff Selection Commission examination and the movement thereafter
 esayssi ne bhi pehle dhyaan nahin diya magar baad main mana kii li ho sakati he or 21 farvari kii pariksha ko radd karnaa padaa
 Students are demanding that it will happen again
 aaj hi dilli se khabar he ki dilli police ne esayssi kii loar division clerk pariksha paper li maamle main chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 51 lakh cash, 3 laptops, 10 mobile phones, many pen drives and hard disks have been recovered from them
 dilli police or upi estf ne milakar yah oparation kiya he
 On Tuesday, February 28, when thousands of students were taking online exams, the Delhi Police raided them at Gandhi Vihar on the information of UP STF
 ye log online paper kaa samaadhaan kara rahe the
 Online examination is also not free from theft
 iske liye kai flats bhi kiraye par liye gaye the
 This is part of the report of our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar
 mukesh singh senger kaa kahana he ki in logon ne gandhi vihaar main kareeb 15 computer lab bana rakhe the
 It was here that answers to online questions were prepared
 ek ek chaatr se 15 lakh rupee lekar ye naukariyon main paas kara rahe hai
 According to the police, these people have solved papers of 180 students
 ab agar aap 15 lakh se guna kiijie to yah rakam hoti he 27 karod tak
 Don't you think there will be great people involved in this as well
 police ke mutabik esayssi ne parikshaon kaa tender SIFY naam kii ek company ko diya hua he
 His employees can also join the game
 to kya chaatro kii maang main dam nahin tha ki esayssi kii pariksha main dhaandhlee ho rahi he
 Today, there has been a statement in the newspapers by Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh that SSC Combined Graduate Level 2017 examination will not be repeated
 iskaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota he
 On one hand the Delhi Police is catching the gang of solving online questions in SSC exam, on the other hand the Minister is saying that the question of re-examination does not arise because the question papers leak in the SSC CGL 2017 exam Is not born ye jawaab jitendra singh ne loksabhaa main likhit rup se diya he
 The minister's written answer is something, on the other hand Delhi Police is also arresting 4 people for leaking the exam
 1 agast 2017 ko bhi hamane puraa prime time kiya tha jab news channel hindu muslim dibet dikhaakar aapke bacchon ko dangai banane ke project main khel khel rahe the
 You might have just noticed that Cobra Post has performed a sting operation
 channel ke log paise lekar hindu muslim dibet khadaa kar rahe hai
 If asked correctly, Delhi Police is doing a good job in the case of question papers leaking
 pichley saal se ham is maamle main dilli police kii kamyaabi ko trek kar rahe hai
 You will know that many private companies, whose number is more than a dozen, are now conducting exams with money
 aisi hi ek company ko theka mila tha National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) kii post graduate pariksha yojit karaane kaa
 It is an American company
 isane dilli police ke saamne mana tha ki pariksha ke system ko koi hack kar saktaa he
 Even then we had raised the question whether we cannot create an honest examination system
 dilli police ne bahut mehnat se chargeshit taiyaar kii he
 Raids in Noida, Chandigarh, arrested four people, but alas the police could not do such a thing
 is maamle main madhyapradesh main hue medical pravesh pariksha kii dhaandhlee ke maamle main cese ladane vaale anand raay ne adaalat main yachika daayar kii thi
 This is another one
 sarkaar khud aise maamalon main chaatro kii taraf se cese nahin ladati he, kisi anand raay ko saamne aana padataa he, jokhim uthaanaa padataa he
 To this day, it is being stolen while we have seen various forms of Vyapam Scam of Madhya Pradesh
 vyapam main 592 logon ke khilaaf chargeshit daayar he
 There is an arrest warrant against 200
 is jaanch ko bhi dhimaa kiye jane kii report aap di vir hindi kii website par pard sakate hai
 Even after all this, the business continues till today
 kabhi aapane sochaa he ki jab ye chaatr 12veen paas karke college kii taraf jaaenge to vahaan kahaan jaaenge
 Have you ever seen the condition of colleges in the states, you have found out whether there are teachers or not, then find out and then stress about school education
 aapke bacchon ke liye achche college nahin hai
 The leaders have ruined the colleges
 aapako yakeen na ho to aap rajya bataaiye, vahaan aakar main dikhaa saktaa hum
 You must have seen in college series college colleges have turned into junk
 kuch college bache hai vahaan bhi nai samasyaayein dastak de rahi hai
 When you hear the news that the government will now tell colleges that you will pay 70 rupees for 100, but you will have to arrange for 30 rupees, take a loan, pay interest, then do you understand what this decision has on your life Will affect
 inhen sawaalon ko lekar dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek hafte tak hadtaal rahi he magar kahin koi charchaa nahin
 The comments 28 march ko phir se shikshak or chaatr hazaron kii sankhya main dilli kii sadakon par utre hai
 These included Teachers 'association of most colleges of Delhi University and students' organization AISA, SFI CYSS, KYS, etc
teachers 'association and Students of jamiya millaya islamia ke shikshak sangh or chaatr, jeenyu ke shikshak sangh or chaatr, aligarh muslim uniwarsity ke shikshak or chaatr is march main shaamil hue
 The march has started from Mandi House to Parliament Street
 in collejon ke karmchaaree sanghathanon ne bhi hissaa liya he
 Today was a big day for students and teachers
 is march kaa aahvaan 40 vishvavidhyalayon kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale fedkuta or duuta ne kiya tha
 They say that on March 27, the UGC has made it clear that the central government will meet those whose salary comes from the UGC and the Ministry of Human Resources, which have been extended under the Seventh Pay Commission
 yah jeet to he magar yahi baat karmchaariyon ke liye nahin kahi gai he or rajyon ke vishvavidhyalayon ke shikshakon ke liye nahin kahi gai he
 Against this protest, this march has come out
 isamen kai mudde shaamil hai
 There was no decision on the matter of pension of teachers

 The condition of colleges across the country is very bad

 As much as the speech is about the Ram Navami procession, the speech is not about the bad condition of the colleges
 dhire-dhire ucch shiksha mahangi hogi to garib se lekar 40-50 hazaar kamaane vaale maa baap apane bacchon ko college main kaise bhej sakenge
 First, no college is left of the state in the state
 baari sankhya main shikshakon kii kami he
 Sushil Mahapatra and Amitesh wanted to know from the students who attended this rally how they understand about these questions

 An assumption has been made, but when facts are presented, it is not made to answer

 a number was repeatedly flashing from Jalgaon in Maharashtra on my mobile
 hamane uthaaya to udhar se ek dasvin class kii ladki thi, awaz main gussa bhi tha, maayusi bhi thi
 If he had his own questions, we said that record the video and send it

 Sources say so
 desh bhar main parikshaon ke prashn patr li ho rahe hai, unki chintaa ko koi sambodhit nahin karata he
 But here the matter is of that middle class, of those CBSE schools, so the activism of the Prime Minister is also notable

 In Bihar, students protested at the place in question for leaking of question paper, there was no resentment about it

 We are not angry that we are not aware of it, but it is that those young people of ordinary families have broken up inside

 In Chhapra, lakhs of students at JP University and Bihar University are doing a three-year BA in five to seven years, neither the Prime Minister is angry nor the Chief Minister is angry
 bi aar ambedkar bihar uniwarsity main 2017 main koi pariksha hi nahin hui, koi naaraaz nahin hua
 Therefore, it is better to get angry with the news of resentment that we should look at these examination system properly, leaving all the work for the last three months and doing a job series, but it did not make anyone angry either
 bihar main lakhon chaatr riselt kaa intazaar kar rahe hai magar vahaan kya ho rahaa he aap pataa kiijie

 There is no honest examination system in Bhopal nor in Patna nor anywhere in Delhi

 When the students of SSC sat on a dharna in Delhi for several days about rigging in the examination system

 The rigging in the SSC examinations should be investigated by the CBI and the Supreme Court should monitor it
 inaki baat par esayssi ne bhi dhyaan nahin diya magar baad main jab andolan tej hua to kuch parikshaayen radd kerani padin
 Now these students are coming to Delhi again on 31 March

 The condition of colleges across the country is very bad

 As much as the speech is about the Ram Navami procession, the speech is not about the bad condition of the colleges

 An assumption has been made, but when facts are presented, it is not made to answer
 aapane dilli main dekha hoga
 When the students of SSC sat on a dharna in Delhi for several days about rigging in the examination system
 inke dharne ko raajnneetik ke zarie todane kaa prayaas hua, kabhi koching mafia kaa haath bataaya gaya to kabhi kuch magar ye chaatr yahi to kah rahe the ki eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha chahie
 The rigging in the SSC examinations should be investigated by the CBI and the Supreme Court should monitor it
 inaki baat par esayssi ne bhi dhyaan nahin diya magar baad main jab andolan tej hua to kuch parikshaayen radd kerani padin
 Now these students are coming to Delhi again on 31 March
 tab aap tivi khol kar dekhiegaa ki inaki maang par koun sa channel dhyaan detaa he
 CBSE should have been alerted to the rigging of the Staff Selection Commission examination and the movement thereafter
 esayssi ne bhi pehle dhyaan nahin diya magar baad main mana kii li ho sakati he or 21 farvari kii pariksha ko radd karnaa padaa
 Students are demanding that it will happen again
 aaj hi dilli se khabar he ki dilli police ne esayssi kii loar division clerk pariksha paper li maamle main chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 51 lakh cash, 3 laptops, 10 mobile phones, many pen drives and hard disks have been recovered from them
 dilli police or upi estf ne milakar yah oparation kiya he
 On Tuesday, February 28, when thousands of students were taking online exams, the Delhi Police raided them at Gandhi Vihar on the information of UP STF
 ye log online paper kaa samaadhaan kara rahe the
 Online examination is also not free from theft
 iske liye kai flats bhi kiraye par liye gaye the
 This is part of the report of our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar
 mukesh singh senger kaa kahana he ki in logon ne gandhi vihaar main kareeb 15 computer lab bana rakhe the
 It was here that answers to online questions were prepared
 ek ek chaatr se 15 lakh rupee lekar ye naukariyon main paas kara rahe hai
 According to the police, these people have solved papers of 180 students
 ab agar aap 15 lakh se guna kiijie to yah rakam hoti he 27 karod tak
 Don't you think there will be great people involved in this as well
 police ke mutabik esayssi ne parikshaon kaa tender SIFY naam kii ek company ko diya hua he
 His employees can also join the game
 to kya chaatro kii maang main dam nahin tha ki esayssi kii pariksha main dhaandhlee ho rahi he
 Today, there has been a statement in the newspapers by Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh that SSC Combined Graduate Level 2017 examination will not be repeated
 iskaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota he
 On one hand the Delhi Police is catching the gang of solving online questions in SSC exam, on the other hand the Minister is saying that the question of re-examination does not arise because the question papers leak in the SSC CGL 2017 exam Is not born ye jawaab jitendra singh ne loksabhaa main likhit rup se diya he
 The minister's written answer is something, on the other hand Delhi Police is also arresting 4 people for leaking the exam
 1 agast 2017 ko bhi hamane puraa prime time kiya tha jab news channel hindu muslim dibet dikhaakar aapke bacchon ko dangai banane ke project main khel khel rahe the
 You might have just noticed that Cobra Post has performed a sting operation

 If asked correctly, Delhi Police is doing a good job in the case of question papers leaking
 pichley saal se ham is maamle main dilli police kii kamyaabi ko trek kar rahe hai
 You will know that many private companies, whose number is more than a dozen, are now conducting exams with money
 aisi hi ek company ko theka mila tha National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) kii post graduate pariksha yojit karaane kaa
 It is an American company
 isane dilli police ke saamne mana tha ki pariksha ke system ko koi hack kar saktaa he
 Even then we had raised the question whether we cannot create an honest examination system
 dilli police ne bahut mehnat se chargeshit taiyaar kii he
 Raids in Noida, Chandigarh, arrested four people, but alas the police could not do such a thing

 Have you ever seen the condition of colleges in the states, you have found out whether there are teachers or not, then find out and then stress about school education
 aapke bacchon ke liye achche college nahin hai
 The leaders have ruined the colleges

 You must have seen in college series college colleges have turned into junk

 staff salection kamishan kii pariksha main dhaandhlee hone or uske baad andolan se hi sibiesai ko satark ho janaa chahie tha
 SSC also did not pay attention at first but later believed that it could be leaked and the examination of 21 February had to be canceled
 chaatr maang kar rahe hai ki dobaaraa se hogi
 Today it is news from Delhi that Delhi Police has arrested four people in the SSC Lower Division Clerk examination paper leak case
 unke paas se 51 lakh nagad, 3 laptaap, 10 mobile phone, bahut saare pen drive or hard discs baraamad hue hai
 Delhi Police and UP STF have jointly conducted this operation
 mangalvaar yani 28 farvari ko jab hazaron chaatr online pariksha de rahe the tabhi upi estf kii soochna par dilli police ne unke saath gandhi vihaar main chhapemari kii
 These people were providing online paper solutions
 aanaline pariksha bhi chori se mukt nahin he
 Many flats were also rented for this
 hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger kii report kaa yah hissaa he
 Mukesh Singh Sengar says that these people had built about 15 computer labs in Gandhi Vihar
 yaheen se online sawaalon kaa jawaab taiyaar kiya jaataa tha
 They are passing these jobs for 15 lakh rupees from each student
 police ke mutabik ye log 180 chaatro ke paper salve kar chuke hai
 Now if you multiply it by 15 lakhs, then this amount is up to 27 crores
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki isamen bade bade log bhi shaamil honge
 According to the police, SSC has given the tender for the examinations to a company called SIFY
 uske bhi karmchaaree is khel main shaamil ho sakate hai
 So, was there no merit in the demand of the students that SSC examination is being rigged
 aaj hi akhabaaron main carmik rajya mantri jitendra singh kaa bayaan aayaa he ki esayssi kambind graduate level 2017 kii pariksha dobaaraa nahin hogi
 Its question does not arise
 ek taraf dilli police esayssi kii pariksha main online sawaal hal karne ke giroh ko pakad rahi he, duusari taraf mantri kah rahe hai ki dobaaraa pariksha kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota he kyonki esayssi sijiel 2017 kii pariksha main prashn patron ke li hone kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota he
 Jitendra Singh has given this answer in writing in the Lok Sabha
 mantri ji kaa likhit jawaab kuch he, duusari taraf dilli police pariksha li karaane ke maamle main 4 logon ko giraftaar bhi kar rahi he
 We also did full prime time on August 1, 2017, when news channels were playing games in the project of rioting your children by showing Hindu Muslim debates
 abhi aapane dekha hoga ki cobra post ne ek sting oparation kiya he
 People of the channel are raising Hindu Muslim debates with money
 sahi puuchhie to prashn patron ke li hone ke maamle main dilli police acha kaam kar rahi he
 Since last year, we have been tracking the success of Delhi Police in this case
 aapako pataa hoga ki kai privet companiyaan jinaki sankhya darjan se zyaada he ab paise lekar pariksha kaa aayojan kara rahi hai
 One such company was awarded the contract to conduct the post graduate examination of National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET)
 yah amareeki company he
 It had assumed before the Delhi Police that one could hack the examination system
 tab bhi hamane sawaal uthaaya tha ki kya ham ek eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha nahin bana sakate hai
 Delhi Police has prepared the charge sheet very diligently
 noida, chandigarh main chaape maare, chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya magar afsos baaki police aisa kaam nahin kar saki
 In this case, Anand Rai, who fought the case in the case of rigging the medical entrance examination in Madhya Pradesh, had filed a petition in the court
 ye ek or he
 The government itself does not fight cases on behalf of students in such cases, some Anand Rai has to come forward, risk has to be taken
 aaj tak chori ho rahi he jabaki madhya pradesh ke vyapam ghotaale kaa ham vibhats rup dekh chuke hai
 a charge sheet has been filed against 592 people in Vyapam
 200 ke khilaaf arest warrant he
 You can read the report of the slowing down of this investigation on The Wire Hindi website
 ye sab hone ke baad bhi aaj tak har jagah vyapam jari he
 Have you ever thought that when these students pass the 12th and go towards the college, where will they go there
 kabhi aapane rajyon main collejon kii haalat dekhi he, vahaan shikshak hai yaa nahin, ye pataa kiya he, pataa kar lijie phir skool kii padhai ko lekar tension kiijie
 Colleges are not good for your children
 netaaon ne collejon ko barbaad kar diya he
 If you are not sure, then tell me the state, i can show it by coming there
 uniwarsity series main aapane dekha hoga college ke kamlej kabad main badal chuke hai
 There are some colleges left, there are new problems knocking
 jab aap yah khabar sunate hai ki sarkaar ab collejon se kahegi ki 100 main 70 rupaya denge magar 30 rupee kaa intazaam aapako khud karnaa hoga, lone lenaa hoga, uskaa byaaz dena hoga to kya aap samaj pate hai ki is faisle kaa aapaki zindagi par kya asar padegaa
 There has been a strike for a week in Delhi University regarding these questions but there is no discussion anywhere
 tippaniyan On 28 March, thousands of teachers and students again descended on the streets of Delhi
 inamen dilli vishvavidhyalay ke adhiktar collejon ke shikshak sangh or chaatro kaa sanghathan isa, esefai sivaiesus, kevaies vagairah shaamil the
 Teachers and students of Jamia Millia Islamia, Teachers Association and Students of JNU, Teachers and Students of Aligarh Muslim University joined this march
 mandi house lekar sansad maarg tak yah march niklaa he
 Staff organizations of these colleges have also participated
 chaatro or shikshakon ke liye aaj kaa din bada din tha
 The march was called by Fedakuta and Duta, representing 40 universities
 inkaa kahana he ki 27 march ko ujisi ne saaf kiya he ki jinaki selary ujisi or maanav sansaadhan mantralay se aati he, jinhen saatven vetan ayog ke tahat badhaayaa gaya he use centre sarkaar puraa karegi
 This is a victory, but the same has not been said for the employees and teachers of the universities of the states
 jiske virodh ko lekar yah march niklaa he
 There are several issues involved
 shikshakon ke pension ke maamle ko lekar koi faisla nahin hua
 Thousands of Adhak teachers also joined this march on their appointment
 swaittata kaa mudda to tha hi
 Recently, JNU teachers and students took out a march from JNU to Parliament to protest against the decision of the Ministry of Human Resources
 desh bhar ke collejon kii haalat bahut hi karaab he
 So much so that if you look at the 27 points of my university series, the food will not be digested
 jitna bhaashan ramanavami ke juluus ko lekar he, utana bhaashan collejon kii khasta haalat ko lekar nahin he
 Gradually higher education will be expensive, so how can parents who earn 40-50 thousand from the poor send their children to college
 awwal to rajya ke rajya main ek bhi college ab dhang kaa nahin bachaa he
 There is a shortage of teachers
 susheel mahapatra or amitesh ne is raily main aae chaatro se jaananaa chaha ki unke bich in sawaalon ko lekar kisi samaj he
 a lift man from Amitesh said that JNU people keep on performing, when Amitesh told that they are doing this so that when your children can get good and cheap education when they go to college, then they look around
 dharna bana di gai he magar jab tathy saamne rakhe jate hai to jawaab dete nahin banataa he

 Because it proves that your partner is not in love with you

 The film has already been shown in many film festivals and due to not being censored, its release date was changed several times

 Story based on the backdrop of Delhi, this film is a story from the morning of 31 October 1984 to the late night
 yah vahi din tha jab bharat kii purv pradhanmantri swargiya indira gandhi kii goli markar hatya kar di gayi thi or har taraf dange bhadakne lage
 Meanwhile, the Sikh family of Devinder Singh (veer Das), his wife Tejinder Kaur (soha Ali Khan), are trying to save their lives amid these riots
 lekin kya inke dost or kareebi log inhen dango se bachaa paane main safal honge
 You will find out about this by going to the nearest theater
 kamjor kadiyaan1
 An attempt has been made to show such a big issue in the film, but you cannot connect yourself to the dialogues of the characters at that moment
 2
 The screenplay seems very weak as well as the way of showing it is also very weak
 3
 Veer Das is playing a Sikh character, but he is unable to connect himself to the audience from anywhere
 4
 The riots caused by the death of Indira Gandhi are depicted in a very limited way, which would have been made even better if the film looked even more interesting as the subject itself is very attractive
 5
 Soha Ali Khan, who appeared in films after several days, has also not made a special impression, though she has acted in a few scenes
 6
 The film seems to be suitable for a particular kind of audience and mostly for film festivals, the mass audience will be disappointed
 kyon dekhenyadi aap actor vir das or soha ali khan ke bade fain hai, to ek baar cinemaghar tak jaakar dekh sakate hai
 However, the facts before the end credits at the end of the film make you think

 With this victory, the Indian team has not only secured the top position in the Test rankings but has retained its dominance at home
 vaise to siries ke antargat kanpur or kolkata main hue maichon main team india ne apana dabadabaa kaayam rakhaa, lekin siries ke tahat ab tak hue maichon ko ek or baat ke liye yaad rakhaa jayega
 So far, 16 half-centuries have been scored in both the matches of the series, but the wait for the cricket fans who are waiting for the century is still not complete
 kanpur test main bharat ke liye pehali pari main murali vijay or cheteshwar pujaara or duusari pari main vijay, pujaara, rohit sharma or jadeja ne ardhashatak jamaaye, vahiin newjiland kii ore se pehali pari main openar tom latham or captain ken williamsan jabaki duusari pari main luk ronchi or michel centner shatak banane main safal rahe
 Out of this, Ranchi reached the 80s but could not complete the century
 tippaniyan The same story was repeated in the second test of Kolkata
 bharat ke liye pehali pari main cheteshwar pujaara, ajinkya rahane or riddhimaan saaha ne ardhashatak jamaaye jabaki duusari pari main yah kaam rohit sharma or saaha (pehali pari main bhi ardhashatak) ne kiya
 The only half-century of the match for New Zealand was scored by Latham
 is test main bharat kii pehali pari main cheteshwar pujaara ne 87 or duusari pari main rohit sharma ne 82 ran banaae lekin shatak is match main bhi nahin ban paaya
 Anyway, the series has been dominated by bowlers compared to batsmen
 donon maichon main koi bhi team 400 ran kaa aankada paar nahin kar pai or kanpur test kii duusari pari kaa 5 wicket par 377 ran (pari ghoshit) ab tak kaa sarvocch score rahaa he
 The third and final match of the series is to be played in Indore from 8 October
 dekhnaa he ki khelpremiyon kaa shatak kaa yah intjaar vahaan bhi puraa ho saktaa he yaa nahin

 kolkata ke duusare test main bhi yahi kahani doharaai gai
 Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane and Wriddhiman Saha scored half-centuries in the first innings for India, while Rohit Sharma and Saha (half-centuries in the first innings) did the same in the second innings
 newjiland ke liye match kaa ekmaatr ardhashatak uske openar latham ne jamaaya
 In this test, Cheteshwar Pujara scored 87 in India's first innings and Rohit Sharma scored 82 runs in the second innings but the century could not be scored in this match
 vaise bhi siries main ballebaaj kii tulana main gendbaajon kaa varchasv rahaa he
 Neither team crossed the 400-run mark in both the matches and the second test of the Kanpur Test was 377 for 5 wickets (innings declared) till date
 siries kaa teesraa or antim match 8 oktober se indore main khelaa janaa he
 It remains to be seen whether this wait for the century of sports enthusiasts can be completed there too

 Shaurya Doval, son of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, has finally broken the silence on the allegations made about his foundation
 shaury dobhaal ne ek samachar channel ke kaarykram ke dauraan kaha he ki aarope lagane waalon ko aarope sabit karnaa chahie
 It is noteworthy that in the report of the news website The Wire has raised the issue of the use of influence of the members of the foundation in the government for the conflict of interest and lobbying on Shaurya Doval's 'india Foundation'
 shaury dobhaal india foundation ke diarector hai
 The Wire reported that the India Foundation is one of the top think tanks in the country, with four senior ministers as its members
 report main 'india foundation' main modi sarkaar ke mantriyon ke shaamil hone or foundation ko deshi-videshi companiyon se laabh pahunchane kaa daawa kiya gaya he
 Shaurya Doval said, "one can say anything in political debates
 yah ek loktantr he
 But they should prove their charges in court
 jo bhi aarope laga rahe hai, unhen apane aaropon ko taarkik tareeke se court main sabit karnaa chahie agar ve court kaa rasta akhriyaar karte hai
 And if they do not want to go to court and are only raising it at the level of debate, then take it to the public and prove their perception to the public
 "da vir kii hi ek anya report main BJP adhyaksh amit shah ke bete jai shah kii company ko lekar uthaae gaye mudde par shaury dobhaal ne kaha, "BJP ko bhrashtachar ke kisi mudde ko court tak le jane main koi dikkat nahin he, or congress ko bhi nahin hona chahie
 If they believe that BJP is corrupt then they should take the path of justice and take the matter to court
 is tarah ke maamalon ke liye adaalat he hi
 "shaurya Doval, however, did not clarify whether he would take the court's course in the case raised against him
 court cese karne ke sawaal par shaury dobhaal ne kaha, "main yah kahana chaah rahaa hum ki court kisi aarope ko sabit karne kaa ek rasta he or court dwaara doshi qaraar die gaye vyakti ko sajaa bhugatne ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 "the India Foundation's involvement with several ministers has also been claimed by 'india Foundation' run by Shaurya Doval and BJP National General Secretary Ram Madhav
 saath hi iske nideshak mandal main raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman, vaanijya mantri suresh prabhu or naagarik uddyan rajyamantri jayant sinha ke alaava videsh rajyamantri em je akbar bhi shaamil hai
 It has also been claimed in the news report that the opaque financial transactions of the Foundation and the senior ministers of the Union Cabinet being directors in it raise many questions
 aisa isliye bhi kyonki sanghathan ke akjicutive diarector shaury dowaal kaa khud ek aisi vittiya sanstha gemini finantial services naam kii form chalaate hai, jo asian or duusare deshon kii arthvyavasthaaon ke bich lenden kaa kaam karti he
 The news report claims a conflict of interest, arguing these facts
 nahin mili sawaalon ke javabwebsite ne ye bhi daawa kiya he ki yah santhaan ek trust chalaata he, aise main kanoonee taur par uske liye balanceshit saarvajanik karnaa jaruri nahin he
 At the same time, it has also been claimed that despite the association of union ministers, it has refused to disclose its income source
 website ne foundation se jude 6 logon se is sambandh main sawaal poochne par bhi koi jawaab na milane kaa daawa kiya he
 However, it has also been written that Shaurya Doval has spoken about the earnings of the foundation through conference, advertisement and journal

 bijepi mandiron main aarakshan ke khilaaf nahinisai daliton ko mandiron main na mili koi padandhra pradesh sarkaar ne mandiron main anusuchit jati, janajati, pichde varg or mahilaon ko 50 fisadi aarakshan diya he
 At the same time, BJP has termed this decision of Jaganmohan Reddy government against the Hindu sentiment
 andhra pradesh ke ek bijepi netaa kaa kahana he ki rajya sarkaar ko yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki jo dalit isai ban chuke hai unhen hindu mandiron main kisi pad par namit na kiya jaae
 Lanka Dinakar, who joined BJP after quitting BJPTDP against the appointment of Christians, said that his party is not against this 50 per cent reservation
 lekin hindu mandiron ke managing trust main isaayiyon ke shaamil kiye jane ko lekar party chintit jarur he
 Lanka Dinakar said, 'everyone who comes to power in Andhra Pradesh keeps an eye on Hindu temples and their lands
 ' unhone kaha ki kya yah sach nahin he ki jo hindu dalit isai ban chuke hai ve aaajeevan dalit hi rahete hai
 Is it not true that religion-changing politicians of all parties are publicly represented in the name of Dalits
 kya yah daliton ke saath anyaay nahin he?bijepi netaa ne kaha ki andhra pradesh main hindu mandiron main namit padon par daliton ko aarakshan mil chukaa he
 We demand that only Hindu Dalits be nominated to these posts
 lekin aisa lagata he ki dharm parivartan kar chuke daliton ko in padon par niyukti kii anumati di ja rahi he jo in saarvajanik padon par rahete hue dalit varg kaa pratinidhitiv karte rahenge
 If the government appoints converts Dalits in these temples, these appointments will be against the Hindu spirit
 kya he jagan sarkaar kaa faislagauratlab he ki pichhadaa varg (BC), anusuchit jati (SC), anusuchit janajati (ST) ko 50 fisadi or mahilaon ko 50 fisadi aarakshan diya he
 Under this, every board of trustees will have 50 per cent reservation for SC, ST and OBC candidates out of the total number of nominated members (except ex-officio members)
 iske alaava kul manonith sadasyon main se 50 fisadi mahilaayein hongi, jinamein SC / ST or BC varg se 50 fisadi cote ke tahat namit mahila sadsy shaamil hai
 Earlier, the Jaganmohan Reddy government had announced 50 percent reservation for backward classes, scs, sts and minorities in corporations, boards, societies and market placements

 pradhanmantri pad ke bhaajapa pratyaashee ne satta ke liye apane antim sangharsh main utarate hue takanic premi aadhuniktaavaadi ke rup main nayaa avatar liya he
 The point they have reached today does not contribute to the fact that they travel at speeds of over 400 miles per hour at an altitude of more than 30,000 feet above the ground, even if their hawker executive passes through the windows of the jet
 The clouds whisper in their ears and give divine messages
 vaise bhi is yatri ko ishwar se samvaad ke liye hameshaa janaa jaataa rahaa he
 This long-distance chariot ascension in Indian politics traveled to controversial mythological sites and ancient ruins of civilization and mobilized against the polity that deprived Hindus of their deities
 ve rath par savaar rashtravaadi the jinhone dharmik asantosh ko ek aitihaasik vot main tabdeel kar diya
 This vote did not give India Ramrajya, but its first right-wing government
 lekin vah unki sarkaar nahin thi
 The entire credit of that government went to a person who gave priority to collectivity rather than dispersal, disintegration
 yah alpakaalik romance tha or ek behad betuka naaraa satta ke khatme or haar kii shuruyaat kaa sabab bana
 This tireless traveler, in search of despair, was also looking for rays of hope

 He rediscovered the secular soul of the founder of the Islamic Republic, but as audacious as it was, he was also suicidal
 lekin vah yatri bephikr aage badhata hi gaya, us samay bhi jab uski apni hi banaai party ne use tyaag diya
 But the road ahead was not over for him and the party declared him as the Prime Ministerial candidate by consensus to regain power in India

 After all, it is a 'now or never' situation for them

 As he retreats to rest on the seat of his jet, drinking his favorite flavoring milk, he is confident of emerging as the lone leader of the party who is fighting for power, not against power
 ve baraak obama se prerit hokar sahi myne main america raashtrapati ke chunaav vaali prachaar style main abhiyaan kii aguai kar rahe hai
 It is not clear from the promotional material like 'advani for the post of Prime Minister' or 'strong Leader, Decisive Government'
 darasal, samoochaa abhiyaan adwani ko lekar ek tarah kii raishumaari ho gai he
 It is virtually a battle of 'advani vs others'
 ve khud sandesh hai or sandeshvahak bhi
 So, when you ask him, 'do you think that the results of the parliamentary elections will also be like the election of the American President? Will it be a vote for Advani or for the BJP? So they come first on the defensive, 'we have a parliamentary system here
 
 
 ’ lekin sara abhiyaan to aap par kendrit he?’ sambhav he, yah samay kisi aisi cheez ke bare main kamajori dikhaane yaa khed jataane kaa nahin he jisaki jimmedaari ve puri tarah se le sakate hai, isliye ve sweekaar karte hai, ‘isamen galat kya he
 This is not a new thing

 'nevertheless, they do not want to reach the floor like a traveler who is weighed down by the perverse burden of the past
 lekin ve us boj se puri tarah mukti bhi nahin paa sakate
 The past is a story of change and reconstruction
 is yatri ne har padaav par, chaahe vah ayodhya rahaa ho yaa dilli yaa karachi, ek aisi pahchaan hasil kii he jo bharat ke vamapanthiyon or udaarvaadiyon ke soch se mail nahin khaati
 Today, whether Advani is giving speeches or talks, he is giving a new twist to his development story and the first symbol is not the iphone which he carries along
 vah nayaa mode unki shabdaawalee main jhalkata he
 If you ask him about his biggest message, he will immediately say, 'internet connectivity was the biggest contribution of science in the twentieth century
 ham chaahate hai ki is desh kaa har ladkaa, har ladki computer sakshar bane
 Deepak Chopra, a confidant who has always been with him in his election tour, feels Advani may get lost in the electronic labyrinth, so he gives a booklet about the party's attitude towards IT titled 'metamorphosis of India'
 
 isamen digital hivej, achche shashan ke liye i-shashan or sabhi ke liye i-vikaas jaise adhyay hai
 Vajpayee once gave a call - "let the Bengalis emerge!" The booklet promises to create e-heaven, expanding that call, where digital will go from education and health care to personal identity and national security
 usamen bhrashtachar mukt bharat kaa bhi vaada kiya gaya he
 Advani says, 'after all, youth are our strength
 ’lekin aap utane yuva to nahin hai
 'age doesn't matter

 Leaders like Gandhi and Jayaprakash Narayan exemplify this
 ’aisa nahin he ki ve yuvaaon ko bhul gaye hai, khaas taur par kuch pratibhashali yuvaaon ko
 'so you are saying that you are getting more intelligent with age?' In response to this question, he tells a story of how Vinoba Bhave learned Arabic at the age of ninety-three to read the Quran in native Arabic
 kahani kaa sabakah adwani yuva banate ja rahe hai, lekin puri tarah se benjamin batan style main nahin
 Nevertheless, this is a unique case of a man who has entered the era of technology from the Puranas with the click of a mouse

 In places like Simdega, Lohardaga and Dhanbad in Jharkhand, they do not make inflammatory speeches, but rather play the role of preacher
 is sookhe kshetra ke junglee ber khaane vaale garibon se ve kehete hai ki ve 21veen shatabdi ko bharat kii shatabdi banaaenge
 They promise to teach them computers; Congress tells about the disillusionment of India, due to which farmers are committing suicide, terrorist attacks are taking place, inflation is increasing and vote bank politics is being done at the cost of protecting the country

 'advani accepts that he cannot win only on the strength of his words
 ve soundbite main maahir nahin hai
 Sitting in a Bell 412 chopper to go to the next rally, he says, 'I am not a skilled speaker like Vajpayee
 ve shabdon se khel sakate the
 So i wanted to handle the organization
 ’ phir ve khed jataate hai, ‘congress main chunaav abhiyaan chalaane vaala koi nahin he
 He has a leader who does not like people
 ’so, adwani ke rup main aapke saamne aisa netaa aata he jo aadhuniktaa ke pairokaar or vinamr vyakti ke rup main bharat kii satta ko jeetna chahta he
 Although his vision is rich in digital content, it lacks the economic message targeting the concerns and frustrations of the current era
 yahaan tak ki bhaajapa ke chunaav ghoshnaa patr main bhi kisi aarthik agenda kaa spasht zikr nahin he, vah bhi aise samay main jab duniya mahaan mandi se jujh rahi he
 What is Advani's economic agenda? He says, 'there are many things that the government should do
 unhen chunaav ghoshnaptr main shaamil karne kii jarurat nahin he
 By the way, the election manifesto states that the BJP will not allow FDI in retail after coming to power
 is vaade ke peeche vajah shaayad yah he ki party apane paramparaagat vot bank, chote vyapaariyon ko khush rakhana chaahati he
 'we should always emphasize on the agricultural sector
 jab hajaaron kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hon to arthvyavastha main oochaal nahin aa saktaa
 This has never happened in India as well
 pratyaksh videshi nivesh par apane rukh ke baavjood, ham hameshaa license-permit raaj ke khilaaf rahe hai
 When the Narasimha Rao government liberated the market, we welcomed it
 lekin har pashchimi cheez kii nakal karnaa bharat ke hit main nahin he
 Isn't it strange that advocates of modernism do not have a modern economic agenda
 kya yah hairaani kii baat nahin lagati jabaki dakshinpanthiyon ne aarthik bahes main aitihaasik jeet pai he?’‘main jaanata hum ki kuch vishamataayen hai
 "is it not in your politics to some extent?" Candidate Advani comes across as a moderate political figure who rarely talks about Hindutva in his speech
 lekin kya varun ke bachaav main utarana sahi tha? aap unki upeksha bhi kar sakate the
 "I would get caught up in another kind of controversy within my own mass base
" apni chhavi banane ke liye aap vyaavhaarikta ko taak par nahin rakh sakate
 The party distanced itself completely from what he allegedly said
 lekin chunaav ayog ne apane adhikaar kaa jarurat se adhik istemaal kiya
 Putting rasus on them is a political distortion
 maine unki tulana jepi se nahin kii thi
 i merely said that strict laws were used against an electoral opponent so that he would lose the election from jail
 jorge furnandis or nanaaji deshmukh jail main rahete hue baari bahumat se chunaav jite the
 It has become a fight between the BJP and the BSP
 basapa muslim matadaataaon ko tusht karne ke liye ye kadam uthaa rahi he
 'but the big question is whether Advani has taken advantage of the opportunity? References for him are spot on - India is under attack and there is disappointment in the market
 kya unke paas aise mudde hai jo lagaataar badhate mohabhang ko parivartan ke andolan main badal saken? adwani or unke prabandhakon kaa vishwaas he ki ve kaamchalaoo raajnneeti ko khatm karne ke liye taiyaar baithe hai
 He has already told his thinkers that they 'should outline the work to be done in the first 100 days
 ’ unka vyapak uddeshy ‘andeh or hataasha kii maujuuda sthiti ko khatm karnaa or janhit vaali sarkaar main logon kaa bharosa paidaa karnaa’ he
 When he arrived at Pandharpur, the first stop of his Maharashtra tour, he was welcomed by the drummer as a man who truly wants to be a savior
 yahaan pehle hi kaaphi shaam ho chuki he or unhen shivagaanv main abhi ek or raily ko sambodhit karnaa he
 They are full of inspiration and want to tell the people the story of an unpopular sultan who once ruled that region
 ek baar vahaan akaal padaa to hajaaron log mar gaye
 Sultan's grain stores were full
 uske sant hriday mantri ne bhandaron ko khol diya jisase har aadmi ne raahat kii saans lee
 The sultan asked his minister to pay the price of the copy
 antat ek daivi hastkshep ke kaaran sultan kaa ghamand chur ho gaya or uski nirdayata bhi khatm ho gai
 'A good king is the one who cares for the public and if i become the Prime Minister, i will be the first servant of India
 ’ or adwani khud dhol bajaane lagate hai, jo unka durlabh pradarshan he
 At one time, such a performance was the highlight of the rise of this nationalist, whose arguments were based on Hindutva
 lagata he, aaj usne yah mahasoos kar liya he ki aisi chizon par use bahut jor dene kii jarurat nahin he
 So, will they now be less vocal about Hindutva to become modern? Those who have been shocked by this change say: Look at Modi, who has struck a good balance between the agenda of modernization and the core ideology of the Sangh Parivar
 adwani is avadharana se waakif hai
 'I am trying my best
 main aisi bhashaa main samvaad banane kii koshish kar rahaa hum jo puure desh ko maanya ho
 Narendra Modi is either looking at Gujarat or taking care of a section of the country's population who do not regret being Hindu
 ’ phir ve tark dete hai, ‘bharat keval isliye dharmanirpeksh he kyonki vah hindu desh he
 When Pakistan declared itself an Islamic state, the natural result should have been that India too would have declared itself a Hindu country
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 Congressmen can claim that India was not declared a Hindu country because of the Congress
 lekin yah sahi nahin he kyonki samvidhan sabha main kisi ne suzav nahin diya ki ham apane ko hindu rajya ghoshit karen
 Then, where will this Ramrajya come from? 'this is the concept of an ideal state and i see no harm in it
 ’ iske baavjood party or uske pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar chhavi ke sankat se jujh rahe hai
 Probably because the country has not yet recovered from Ayodhya
 adwani is mudde ko lekar bahut chintit nahin hai kyonki ve apane boote apana abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 His campaign is linked to a concept known as Advani
 unke abhiyaan kaa prabandhan aise logon ke haath main he jo sanghathanaatmak padanukram ko nahin maanate
 Advani believes that the wind is changing
 ‘upie puri tarah chhin-bhinn ho chukaa he
 We have lost only one component, that too because of his overconfidence
 ham orissa main apni pratikulata ko phaayde main badalane main lage hai, haalanki hamane yah kabhi ummid nahin kii thi ki naveen patnayak aisa karenge
 'the party or Advani could have avoided it
 duusari taraf, nitish kumaar jaise kuch sahyogi rajg ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar se bahut prabhavit nahin hai
 In Advani's personality-driven campaign, allies are not very important
 unhone khud ko janata ke darbar main pesh kar diya he
 People had never got a chance to become the punch of their fate, people have definitely made a perception about them
 es
 His staunch supporters and mentors like Gurumurthy consider him the last creature of the endangered species
 ‘besharmi se bhare rajyatantr main eemaandaaree or sachaai ke prati adwani kii vachanabaddhata andeh se pare he
 'for some he is a Hindu nationalist who used the Puranas to divide the thinking of India
 baharhaal, yah janata ke upar he ki unhen apanaae yaa thukraae
 This time no one can ask them to share credit or suffering
 shrey bhi unka hoga or pidaa bhi unki hogi
 All of this will be biographical, because ideology is flexible
 unki yatra 60 saal se bhi pehle karachi se us samay shuru hui thi jab vahaan ke saint patrix hyskool for bvoij kaa ek chaatr tennis court se tahaltey hue paas kii aresas shakha main chalaa gaya tha
 Since then, he never tired while traveling
 abhi bhi nahin
 But their patience is paying off
 is baar unhen tark se zyada, chunavi yuddh main jeet hasil kerani hogi
 They would have to conquer a country which, they thought, could never understand them

 Chidambaram said on Monday that three people had died in the violence in Jammu region
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar rajya se kisi ko bhi majaboor hokar pravaas karne jaisi 1990 kii sthiti nahin banane degi
 Chidambaram's statement was in reference to the migration of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley due to terrorism in Kashmir in 1990
 unhone rajyasabha ko bataaya ki hinsa prabhavit jammu kshetra main sthiti niyantran main aa gai he or teen logon kii maut hui he
 Chidambaram said, "so far two Muslims and one Hindu have died in the violence
 ham sabhi bhartiya hai
 Three Indians have lost their lives and it is a matter of grave grief
 " Chidambaram said, "we will not allow 1990 to be repeated
 ham majaburi main pravaas kii sthiti nahin paidaa hone denge
 The life of every person in the area is safe
 " Earlier in the Rajya Sabha, Leader of Opposition Arun Jaitley pointed to the onset of terrorism, saying, "if the situation is not controlled, a situation like the 1990s would arise
