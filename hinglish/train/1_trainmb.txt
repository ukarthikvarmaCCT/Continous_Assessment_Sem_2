 "how are you?" He came near and asked with his forehead
 “thik hoon antee, mujhe kya ho gaya tha?”“jaanakar kya karogi? lekin ab tumhen swayan ko sanbhaalanaa chahie
 It's enough
 mujhe dekho main kya karti hoon? kai baar aise cese aate hai jinamein jindagi yaa maut
 
 
 Or to choose between mother and children
 
 
 bachaana hota he
 
 
 But let's try until the last moment
 to mahatvapurn kya he jindagi
 
 
 All the struggle is for life
 tumhaari apni jindagi kii keemat tumhaare liye kitni he yah tumhen sochna hoga
 First of all, think of yourself about your body
 
 
 tadapate rahanaa he yaa aatma kii aawaaj par chalanaa he
 
 
 Frequent incidents are happening to you and you are unable to do anything yourself
 yah sharir tumhaara he yaa kisi or kaa
 If you were my daughter, i would tell you wake up
 
 
 jaago
 
 
 life
 
 
 ko apni gati se chalane do
 
 
 Face what happened
 koi tumhen except nahin karata mat karne do, tum khud ko except karo
 
 
 
 ” kahkar unhone raat vaali sari baat va sthiti bataa di
 She did not want to hide anything from him
 “sari sachai tumhaare saamne he
 with you
 ” sunakar vah chaunki nahin
 There was no surprise or even sorrow
 
 
 chupchaap unka cheharaa dekhati rahi
 Oddly enough, his body was the only one in both incidents
 avyav the
 
 
 Not the mind, not the soul
 “antee, main parajeet nahin hona chaahati
 My nature is not like that, i do not even want to live in solitude
 main ubarna chaahati hoon in sari paristhitiyon se, us dar se
 
 
 Which has been woven all around
 
 
 parivaar waalon ko bhi samajhaana hoga
 "she was speaking openly for the first time today
 ghatnaon ke gahare tal se ab vah upar aane ko chatapata rahi thi
 "if the doctor does not cut the poison spread in the body part, thinking that because of that hand or foot, his body will become ugly, crippled then the poison will spread, but i will again say that that ugliness or disability is important
 Life 
 
 jindagi
 
 
 Understood
 isliye tumhen khud faisla karnaa hoga
 "dr
 shobhaa ne dridhtaa ke saath kaha
 Returning home, his mind was surrounded by strange uneasiness
 apane aasapaas ke damaghontu maahaul ko vah phenk dena chaahati thi
 
 
 At first he set up his cupboard, decorated the books, though his mind was fighting with itself
 ek lambi ladaai ladgaye kii purna taiyaari kar rahi thi vah
 
 
 Have to do something
 
 
 kuch
 
 
 Have to show
 
 
 sabakaa saamana karnaa he
 
 
 Such sentences were giving him continuous thought and energy
 kisi bachche kii aakul aakanksha ki daudkar sabase aage pahunchnaa he
 
 
 Mom, Papa, Bhaiya and Didi wondered what had happened to them
 
 
 ? kahin vah maansik rup se tut to nahin gayi he
 
 
 How did such a sudden change happen? ”sister, tell me your marksheet
 kya tum mere saath college chalogi?”marksheet dekhakar
 
 
 She smiled
 usne marksheet ko yun sparsh kiya jaise kisi beshkeemtee vastu ko chhu rahi ho
 After that incident, today he sat and talked among everyone
 duusare din vah trekking suut pahanakar khadi thi
 Weak from body, but healthy from mind
 “kahan ja rahi ho? baahar niklogi? tumhaara dimag to thik he?”“stadium tak
 "he said in a calm and calm voice
 “doctor ne manaa kiya tha or jaaogi to sab log kya kahenge? puuchhenge tab
 You will miss seeing you
 ab tak to baat dab gayi hogi
 The mother in front of him mumbled badly
 
 
 khadi sawaal-jawaab kar rahi thi
 
 
 His behavior had changed completely
 ve shankit thim
 Something too strict
 “maine koi galati yaa aparaadh nahin kiya, jiske liye main jindagibhar aatmaglani main ghulun
 Mummy
 main har sthiti kaa saamana karuungi chaahe meraa koi saath de yaa na de
 Saying this, she without stopping, picked up the scooter without explaining anything
 
 
 use laga aaj aasmaan ekadam saaf or chamkila he
 Driving a scooter on a well-known road, his mind started talking to the wind

 lekin vittiya lenden zyaadaatar digital hote jane, strot par kar katautee (TDS), strot par kar sangrah (TCS) jaise upayon se yah kaam kaaphi aasaan ho gaya he

 If such people are PAN holders, they can reply online by going to the Income Tax Department's Compliance Portal and take a printout of their answer

 mand mand muskura rahe the
 When the minister got caught in the matter and when the response was known to him, he put the blame for the BJP leader Aarti Mehra
 duusari ore usee din purv vishwa sundari, bollywood abhinetri or bachchan parivaar kii bahu aishwarya raay ko usee din ek puraskaar diya janaa tha
 Which he (ash) refused to take after hearing the news of Mumbai Blast
 gauratlab he ki aishwarya kaa khud is glamer or chakachaundh kii duniya se sidhaa sarokaar he phir bhi wo mumbai ke dard se sihar uthi thi
 Aishwarya refused to take the honor while the ministers who come to Parliament to work for the people of the country did not show any sorrow, wrinkle and no sense of the Mumbai blasts on their faces
 aisa laga jaise kuch hua hi nahin he
 Subodh Kant Sahay continued to enjoy the fashion parade of beauties catwalking on the ramp of a luxurious hotel in Delhi

 But as soon as Aishwarya got the news of the Mumbai blast, she refused to take the honor
 or puraskaar samaaroh ko ek shradhanjali ke saath radd kar diya gaya
 On the other side is Subodh Kant Sahai, who calls himself the representative of the public
 chunaav jitkar sansad tak pahunche hai
 But even after hearing the news of the bomb blast, the heart did not budge
 wo cat walk karti modells kii khubsuurati main is tarah kho gaye jaise yahi unki jindagi thi
 Mumbaikash resumed after the blasts, Subodh Kant could have learned something from minister Aishwarya
 kaash hamaare desh ke karnadhaar netaa janata ke dukh dard ko lekar kuch samvedansheel ho pate
 Neither would it have been a blast then
 or na hi dhamaako par aansu bahaane kii jarurat padati

 In the bjp-led NDA, the feud between the allies continues
 upendra kushvaha kii party araspi jahaan bijepi par dabaav banane ke liye vipaksh ke netaaon se mil rahe hai
 At the same time, the BJP does not seem to be in the mood to give much consideration to Kushwaha after joining the JDU
 araspi ke adhyaksh upendra kushvaha ne bijepi alaakaman amit shah se chaar siton kii maang kii thi, jisase bijepi netritv ne saaf inkaar kar diya he
 According to sources, the BJP agrees to give two seats to Upendra Kushwaha, but he does not seem to agree on this
 sutron ke mutabik bihar main endie ke sahyogi dal kitni or kin siton par chunaav ladenge, isaki ghoshnaa agle hafte ho sakati he
 It is believed that Upendra Kushwaha's party will be excluded from this announcement, in this way the exit of Upendra Kushwaha's party RLSP from NDA is almost fixed

 With this, Nitish Kumar had cleared jdu's opinion about Kushwaha
 bataa den ki teen din pehle siton ke bantwaare ko lekar chiraag paswan ne nitish kumaar or guuruuvaar ko bijepi ke mahasachiv or bihar bijepi ke prabharee bhoopendra yadav se mulaaqaat kii thi or seat bantwaare par charchaa bhi kii thi
 Here, JDU is upset with Upendra Kushwaha's rhetoric against Nitish Kumar
 jediu ne isaki shikaayat bijepi netritv se kii he
 However, Kushwaha too continues to make political moves
 pichley dinon argedy netaa tejasvi yadav se mulaakaat kii thi or haal hi main unhone jediu ke baagi netaa sharad yadav se mulaakaat kii thi
 He called it a private meeting
 kushvaha kaa vipaksh netaaon se mulaakaat karnaa bijepi or jediu ko raas nahin aa rahaa he
 Not only this, Kushwaha had said that if you get milk of Yaduvanshi and rice of Kushwanshi, then it can become a good kheer
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kushvaha ne bihar main bijepi ke netritv vaale endie main rahakar chunaav ladaa tha
 He had won three seats and won all three seats

 The violence on 26 July was followed by a few days of peace, but on 5 and 7 August, nine people were killed in Kokrajhar and Chirang

 a seven-year-old Muslim child from Bhauraguri in Chirang district is yet to recover from the shock of the death of his 55-year-old father and 18-year-old brother
 23 april ko is parivaar kaa ghar jala diya gaya tha jiske baad se puraa parivaar bhauragudi ke raahat shivi main rah rahaa tha
 On August 5, the three secretly walked out of the camp to broker cows in the weekly market of Kajalgaon to earn some income
 yahaan unhen kareeb 25 janajaatiy yuvakon ne gher liya or bachche ke pita or bhai ko kaat daalaa
 The child somehow escaped life and returned to the relief camp
 vah or uski 37 saal kii maa ab gaanv lautne main dar rahe hai
 The attackers want to take advantage of such fear
 yahaan tak ki bodo log bhi badale ke dar se gogoi dwaara tay taarikh tak shivi chhodane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 "we want to wait here for at least five days after Eid," says 34-year-old Pranjeet Mushera, an employee of the forest department living in a relief camp at Gosaigaon in Kokrajhar district

 Those who do not own land but have a name in the voter list should be kept in relief camps until the BTC and the government reach an agreement to decide their fate
 borogyari ne daawa kiya 'avaidh pravasi' is paristhiti kaa phayda uthaa sakate hai or beatiedi ilaake main ghuspaith kar sakate hai
 He says, "according to the 2011 census, the population of Kokrajhar district is around 10
 3 lakh he or isamen 2
 There are 3 lakh Muslims
 lekin kokarajhaar or dhubari jile ke raahat shiviron main kareeb 4,50,000 log rah rahe hai
 Less than half of the Muslim population of Kokrajhar has been affected by the clashes
 yah maananaa behad kathin he ki ek saal main musalamaanon kii jansankhya itani teji se bad gai he
 "gogoi also recognizes that people living in relief camps may also be from outside the affected areas

 lekin ab bhi 3,50,960 log shiviron main rah rahe hai
 The bad news is that the herds of people who left the camp and went back to their villages have started coming back to the camps after renewed violence in Kokrajhar and Chirang

 As the days get closer my heart skips a beat
 Becoming a dad is something i never thought of, i always felt that i want kids coz i love then so much 
 Now it's dawning dawning upon me that a child doesn't only give birth to a mother but even a dad is born
 @bombaysunshine and me we both still don't feel like parents or "mom" & "dad" in the making
 
 
 
 We have always felt that parents only mean our respective mum n dad😋😋😋 now there will be a new entity calling us that
 
 
 completely unfathomable so far
 But we are ready and with the grace of God we will humbly receive the gift he gives us🙏

 ' (input bhashaa se bhi) The border-gavaskar Trophy host became Australia's name as soon as the Melbourne Test drew
 purv captain mahendra singh dhoni ke sanyas ke faisale ne is test ko hameshaa ke liye yaadgaar bana diya, lekin jane se pehle captain dhoni ne team kii ek aisi kami kii ore ishaara kiya jise thik kiye bagaiyr team india ko aage bhi jeet hasil karne main mushkil hoti rahegi
 On the fifth day of the Melbourne Test, Team India were able to get two wickets for Australia, that too late and barely
 purv bhartiya captain sunil gavaskar ke mutabik unhen kam hi ummid thi ki bhartiya gendbaaz 20 wicket hasil kar sakenge jisase team india match jeet jaae, jabaki purv captain emes dhoni maanate hai ki team india main ek olerounder kii kami he jisaki vajah se The burden on bowlers has increased
 melbern test ke foran baad maahi ne saafe taur par kaha ki team ke maujuuda gendbaazon se wo kaafii khush hai
 He bowled well, but the lack of an all-rounder in the team increased the burden on these bowlers
 zaahir he, jis team main jis kami kii ore maahi ishaara kar rahe hai use maanane se shaayad hi kisi ko inkaar ho
 Because the team suffers from this deficiency many times
 ye dhyaan dene kii baat he ki maujuuda series main bhartiya team chah main se chaar baar australian team ko out nahin kar pai yani australian team ke 20 wicket lene main naakaam rahi
 Not only this, Australia once scored more than 500 in all three Tests
 in teen test maichon main australian ballebaazon ne chah shatak or 11 ardhshtkeey paariyaan khelin
 This means that if Team India can show the bowlers their strength in the Sydney Test, then they will need to prove the critics wrong by taking 20 wickets
 nae captain viraat kohli maujuuda halaat main ye kaise kar paaenge yah chunauti unke liye bhi behad badi sabit hone vaali he

 The year 2016 was very special for the Indian cricket team
 jahaan ek ore lagaataar 18 test maichon main aparajit rahane kaa record bana vahiin ek ke baad ek paanch test siries apane naam kii or saath hi ek calendar saal main sarvaadhik test maichon main jeet kaa nayaa kirtiman bhi banaaya
 However, due to the lack of implementation of the recommendations of the Lodha Committee at the same time, the BCCI was also embarrassed, it was also a shock to not reach the final of the ODI series in Australia and the ICC World T20 tournament on its soil
 2016 main ajey rahi team indiatim india ke test captain viraat kohli bhi kehete hai ki world tii20 or australian dharti par asafalataa ko chhod den to saal 2016 bhartiya cricket ke liye acha rahaa
 This saying of Kohli, who has taken cricket to a new height of competition, tells the story of performance in India's cricket
 is saal team india ne 12 test match khele or calendar saal main sarvaadhik nau jeet kaa record sthapit kar is saal akeli aisi team bani jisane is formet main ek bhi match nahin ganvaaya
 Virat surpassed the record of eight wins in 2010
 tihare shatak se hua bench strength kaa pradarshnacricket team game he lihaaja prayek khilaadi kaa yogadan hi match main jeet dilaati he lekin captain viraat kohli or olerounder ravichandran aswin is saal ke sabase badi hero rahe
 Along with this, Cheteshwar Pujara, Murali Vijay, Ravindra Jadeja, Ajinkya Rahane and Karun Nair also made headlines by scoring a triple century in the final Test of the year
 kohli kii captaini main ‘viraat’ bana bharatsal 2014 ke ant main mahendra singh dhoni ke test cricket se sanyas lene ke baad viraat kohli team india ke captain bane or iske baad se hi wo team ko nit nai oonchai par le ja rahe hai
 In 2016, the Test series started with a tour of West Indies and Team India won 2–0 there
 iske baad newjiland ko apane gharelu maidaanon par 3-0 se haraaya or iske baad saal kaa ant england ke khilaaf 5 test maichon kii siries ko 4-0 ke aitihaasik antar se jeet kar kiya
 The nine Test matches in which India won were won by Team India by a margin of three innings, three by a margin of over 200 runs, two by a margin of over 150 runs and a Test by a big margin of eight wickets and once Then took the number-1 crown from Pakistan in the World Rankings of Tests
 kohli kii team india aaj kuch vaise hi mukaam par he jaise kuch varshon pehle australian team thi
 In the Test rankings, India are ahead of Australia (105 points) by a big margin with 120 points
 kohli ke naam rahaa saal 2016viraat kohli ab tak 22 test maichon main captaini kar chuke hai
 Of these, he has won India in 14 while losing in only two
 is saal wo khele gaye 12 test maichon main 75
 He also scored 1215 runs at an average of 93 and when needed he stood up like a wall and lifted the team from crisis
 westeindies, newjiland or england sabhi ke khilaaf viraat ne is saal dohare shatak bhi jade
 Kohli's strong batting style was seen in all three formats of cricket
 philhal kohli isisi world ranking main test or vanade main duusare jabaki tii20 main pehle sthaan par khadey ballebaaj hai
 Ravichandran Ashwin is no less important than the role of captain Kohli in India's success story in Ashwintest matches
 aswin ne is saal na keval gend balki balle se bhi behad saraahneey pradarshan kiya
 He played 23 of 12 Test matches played in 2016
 90 kii ausat se jahaan 72 wicket chatkaaye vahiin 43
 He also scored 612 runs with an average of 72 and two centuries
 aswin ke saath hi ravindra jadeja ne bhi avismaraneey pradarshan kiya
 He supported Ashwin from the other end on the pitch and sent 43 batsmen to the pavilion in the 9 matches played
 england ke khilaaf antim test kii duusari pari main saat or match main 10 wicket lekar jadeja isisi kii gendbaaji ranking main aswin (number-1) ke baad thik number-2 par ja pahunche
 Ashwin was adjudged the Test Cricketer of the Year for his outstanding performance
 wo rahul dravid (2004) or sachin tendulkar (2010) ke baad sar garfield sobers trophy jeetne vaale tisare bhartiya cricketer bane hai
 Team India became the first team to play 900th ODI in odis
 dharmashala main newjiland ke khilaaf is match ko bharat ne chah wicket se jeeta lekin iske agle hi match main newjiland ne kotla par bhartiya team ko haraa diya jo team india kii vanade main 400veen haar bhi thi
 In the 13 odis played in 2016, the team won seven and lost six
 australian dharti par lagaataar chaar haar ke baad antim vanade main jeet mili to saal ke madhya main zimbabwe ko 3-0 or newjiland ko 3-2 se haraaya
 The Asia Cup victory, the World T20 loss, despite winning 15 of the 21 T20 matches played this year and losing only five, did not perform as it did under Kohli's captaincy in the Test format as the team won the World T20 on its own pitches
 Failure was needed then saal kii shuruyaat australian dharti par 3-0 se jeet ke saath hui phir srilanka kii yuva team se apni hi dharti par pehla match haarane ke baad siries 2-1 se or bina ek bhi match ganvaae asia cap toornament jeeta
 After this, in the very first match of the World T20, they started the tournament with a defeat against New Zealand for only 79 runs
 iske baad chirpratidwandvi pakistan (asia cap ke baad isi saal duusari baar), bangladesh or australia ko haraakar semifinal main pahunchi team india ko westeindies ne baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 The Caribbean team also became the champion of this tournament
 paanch maichon main 273 ran banane vaale viraat kohli ko main of da toornament chunaa gaya
 India then defeated Zimbabwe in the T20 series 2–1, but failed to avenge the World T20 in the US from the West Indies
 yahaan pehla match westeindies ne jeeta jabaki doosraa match radd ho gaya
 The talk of Hyderabad-made IPL-2016 championcricket remains incomplete without the discussion of IPL and this year, Virat Kohli also hit the records with his batting here
 kohli ne is toornament main 16 maichon main record 973 ran banaae lekin unki team final main sunrisers hyderabad se haar gayi or iske saath hi kohli kaa apni team royal chalangers bangaleru ko ipel champion banane kaa sapana puraa nahin ho sakaa
 Mumbai Champion in domestic cricket Once again Mumbai coin played in domestic cricket and he became the national champion by winning Ranji Trophy for the 41st time
 mumbai ne farvari main khele gaye final main saurashtra ko ek pari or 21 ran ke antar se haraaya
 Uttar Pradesh won the prestigious Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy in 2016
 saal bhar chalaa BCCI vs SC muqablisi saal bisisiai chairman kaa pad chhodkar shashaank manohar isisi pramukh bane to anuraag thakur board ke duusare sabase yuva adhyaksh
 The Supreme Court accepted most of the recommendations of the Lodha Committee on the bcci's drastic changes in the functioning of the BCCI on July 18 and since then the Board (BCCI) has been miffed
 board ko inamen se kai siforeeshon par aapatti thi
 The board also made every effort to reject those recommendations, but each time it was scolded by the court

 You may not believe it, but when combing the hair with a wood comb, the hair falls short and there is no dandruff
 iske alaava lakdi kii kanghee ke istemaal se sir dard bhi dur ho jaataa he
 These benefits of using wood comb will surprise you: 1

 The use of this comb strengthens the hair roots, which reduces hair fall

 Salman Khan has done such a charisma at the box office whenever director Ali Abbas has accompanied Zafar
 phir vah chaahe 'sultan' ho yaa phir 'tiger jinda he'
 In this way, Salman Khan's Ali Abbas along with Zafar has done a tremendous charisma for the third time
 salmaan khan kii film 'bharat (bharat)' ko bollywood se bhi acha rispons mila he or khub tarifen mil rahi hai
 Anyway, Salman Khan is trying to do something different in his last few films, which is also visible in 'bharat'

 vitt mantri arun jetali ne loksabhaa main paaritakar sanshodhan bilke bare main kuch spashtikaran die he
 In this amendment bill, the government had made several proposals about imposing tax, cess and surcharge on income, but there was a lot of confusion about these proposals and some things were being propagated wrongly
 ab arun jetali ne twit kar iske kai praavdhaanon ko spasht kiya he
 The Taxation Laws (second Amendment) Bill 2016 was introduced on Monday in the Lok Sabha to amend the Income Tax Act, which was passed on Tuesday
 ab yah bill rajyasabha main pesh kiya jayega
 The Rajya Sabha has the option to pass it within 14 days
 iske baad hi yah kanoon ban paaegaa
 In this bill, along with the introduction of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMKY), all the provisions of undisclosed income tax and penalty were proposed
 vitt mantri ne die hai ye spashtikaran1
 Under Section 270A of the Income Tax, the penalty of 200 per cent penalty for concealing income or giving false information about it will continue to be undone
 2
 Till now only 30% tax was levied on such cash, whose source is not able to give any information, but now it is 60% tax, surcharge up to 25% of this tax and cess up to 3% of tax
 Will be taken 3
 In this way, if a person shows this income in his return, then he will have to pay a total tax of 77%, but if the person does not show it in his return and is caught, then he will get 85% of the total amount as tax and penalty
 Will be charged 4
 The penalty has also been increased from 10 and 20 per cent to 30 per cent on the amount received from search and seizure by the Income Tax Department, that too when the person has shown it in his return, otherwise he will get a total of 60 per cent of this income
 May have to be given in the form
 5
 Under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, 50% of the undisclosed income will be taken as tax, penalty and cess, besides 25% of the undisclosed income will have to be deposited in the PGK deposit scheme for four years

 Farmers can also put kit-destroying medicines from Plane, do something like this- Hardik Patel (@hardikpatel_) December 12, 2017 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah also questioned PM Modi's sea-plane visit, saying that the single PM Modi has broken the security protocol by taking z Plus security in the engine plane with and without foreign pilots

 lagaataar chot se jujhate rahe newjiland ke harfanmaulaa khilaadi jaikab oram ne mangalvaar ko test cricket ko alavida kah diya, lekin vanade or twanti-20 cricket khelte rahenge
 The decision-making decision was done by Ooram who said that due to reduced workload, they can extend their international career
 unhone kaha,‘‘ maine test cricket se sanyas lene kaa faisla kiya he
 It was difficult, but i have decided it very thoughtfully
 ’’ mansapeshiyon main lagi chot se jujh rahe 31 varshiya oram champiens trophy main bhi nahin khel paye the
 It was difficult to play all three formats, he said, "for the last few years my body is not able to withstand the stress and pressure of being an all-rounder
 ek saal main 10 maheene khel ke teenon praroopon main khelnaa kathin he
 Oram said that New Zealand does not play as many Tests, as many odis and T20 matches, so he has decided to continue playing in the short form of cricket
 fatafat cricket main zyada avasarunhone kaha ,‘‘ vanade or tii-20 cricket khelte rahane kaa kaaran yahi he ki isamen khilne ke maukey adhik he
 New Zealand teams play less Test cricket, but there is plenty of opportunity to play in the shorter version of the game in tournaments like World Cup, T20 World Cup, Champions Trophy and Indian Premier League
 ’’ Time heals the wounds, but regrettably this happens in idioms rather than politics

 unhone blassout ke din hi urja mantri susheel kumaar scindia ko grih mantri isliye nahin banaaya kyonki unke paas jabarrdast sens of humar yani hasyabodh he
 He did this because he had no other choice

 chindbaram or scindia ko vibhaag saunpane se pehle vitt or grih mantri ke liye dilli main jo kuch or naam charchaa main the, unako yahaan doharaana kaaphi sharmnaak he
 There has also been a time that the Congress used to have so many luminaries to form such two cabinet
 lekin congress ne dhire-dhire apane logon kaa itane yojanabaddh tareeke se ksharan kiya ki ab uske mukhyamantri bhi grih mantralay kii jaruraton ke paimaane par feet nahin baithte

 bhartiya janata party ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne kaha he ki main 2001 main agra shikhar vaarta ke dauraan pakistan ke tatkalin raashtrapati parvej musharraf us vakt behad pareshaan ho gaye, jab unase mafia sargana daud ibrahim ko bharat ke hawaale karne ko kaha gaya
 Addressing a seminar, Advani said that before reaching Agra for the summit, i told Musharraf that we had recently signed an extradition treaty with Turkey
 ham chaahate hai ki bharat or pakistan ko bhi iske bare main sochna chahie
 Advani said that after this i again said that even if there is no extradition treaty between the two countries, but Pakistan should surrender Dawood to India, because the 1993 Mumbai blasts charges have been proved on him
 iske baad hi musharraf pareshaan ho gaye
 Disclosing the reasons for the failure of the Agra summit, Advani said that when Musharraf started to sing the tune that there is no terrorism in India, we flatly refused that there could be no agreement between the two countries
 bharat kaa yah rukh ekadam sahi tha or isse sabit bhi hota he ki aatankwaad par bharat sarkaar gambhir thi
 Advani said that Pakistan has always tried to destabilize India
 use pataa he ki vah bharat ke khilaaf yuddh nahin kar saktaa, isliye usne aatankwaad ko badhaava dena prarambh kiya
 He said that it is totally wrong to target a particular religion for the involvement of some people in the continuous terrorist incidents in the country
 adwani ne kaha ki bhale hi aatankwaadi sanghathan apni dhamkiyon bhare email main quran ke uddhran dete hon, lekin iske chalate islam ko or nishaanaa nahin banaaya janaa chahie
 Referring to the party's demand for a stronger law like POTA to counter terrorism, Advani said that we have accepted the instructions given by the Supreme Court to take precautions in relation to the misuse of POTA
 isse spat hota he ki bhaajapa kathor kanoon banane ke liye kitni drudh he
 Since the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the opposition has been questioning the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM)

 The court had also agreed that today evms can be rigged
 unhone kaha ki jo main pehle bol chukaa hum, ye log (vipaksh) ab sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Let it be said that it has been a month since the results of Lok Sabha elections, but the opposition is still questioning evms

 jammu krime branch ne ek bade racket kaa bhandaphod kiya he or is silsile main do thagon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 These thugs used to take crores of rupees from many people across the country by promising to sell meteor bodies
 thag is ulka pind ke ek inch kii keemat pachaas hajaar karod lagaate the, or phir us ulka pind ko nasa or isro main bikwane tak kaa vaada karte the

 Both are accused that a businessman from Jammu had taken Rs 8 crore from Raj Kumar Gupta for a meteorite and even made an agreement in the court
 lekin 8 karod lene ke baavjood usko abhi tak kuch nahin diya
 According to the gang crime branch operating in several states, Sandeep Rana was arrested from Doda and Venkata Krishna Mattugula from Hyderabad

 yahaan ham aakarshith karne ke 11 jaancha parkhaa nuskhaa bataa rahen hai
 You can also try it
 1
 Flirtation and temptation can be done by anyone and it would automatically be for the woman or man who is beautiful
 or yah koi jaruri nahin ki iske liye ulat ling aapke saamne ho
 According to a famous Time magazine article, do not suppress your feelings and try to woo your friends
 2 manoranjanmashhoor logon ke paas kaaphi urja hoti he or hameshaa nai cheez karne ko aatur hote hai, jisase logon kaa manoranjan ho

 4 Stop blaming Stephen R
 Covey in the '7 Behavior of Influential People', writing that such people carry the responsibility forward
 ve samay, paristhiti or sthaan kaa ronaa nahin rote
 They work isliye ronaa band kiijie
 5 Touching It is also not right that you are talking only by touching every mango-o-khas
 baat karte hue logon ko choona ek kala he or ise siikhnaa jaruri he
 One who knows this art can attract people
 6
 People do not like to grind their mouths, people are fond of bragging themselves, especially new ones
 ham unhen apane karnaamon, apni chizon ke bare main bataate hai
 My car, my father, my house etc
 yah acha nahin he ki aap hameshaa apane munh miyaan mitthu bane
 Give other people a chance to praise you too

 Be happy and think well 8 party kijiesham ko doston kaa saath or uske saath khaanaa-pinaa kise pasand nahin he? logon ko party main bulaanaa dost banane kaa aasaan jariya he
 It also signifies your being cheerful with your generosity
 9 acchhee khooshboovigyaanon ne yah sabit kar diya he ki khooshbu insaan ke bare main yah bataane kaa aasaan jariya he ki aap kitne achche yaa bure insaan he
 According to experts, human emotions also sometimes change according to fragrances
 acchhee sugandh logon kaa mood badal saktaa he
 10 Hav Bhava People like you, it is important that you have a good Hav
 aap khule swabhaav vaale hansmukh insaan ho
 Meet people laughing
 chaahe vah aapke ghar kaam karne vaali naukaraani ho yaa phir aapkaa getkiper
 11 adopt good things, forever is not a one-time jackpot that turns out to be and is done
 iske liye hameshaa mehnat kerani hoti he
 It is not like attracting people only when you have free time or during cut throat competition

 in After demonetisation, the life of the cash keepers has come to an end
 zyada cash rakhane waalon ko iskar kaa dar sataane laga he to kam cash rakhane vaale bainkon ke baahar line main khadey dikhaai de rahe hai
 But the lines, outside the banks, are missing the leaders, industrialists
 lekin 31 march, 2016 tak saarvajanik rup se uplabdh data bataate hai ki modi sarkaar ke mantriyon ke paas badi sankhya main nakadi he
 The Code of Conduct for Ministers states that they should file the details of their assets and liabilities with the Prime Minister's Office every year
 'da hindu' kii khabar ke mutabik kaamanwealth human ritis inishiative dwaara jutaaye gaye data bataate hai ki vartmaan main 76 mantriyon main se keval 40 ne apni nakad raashi kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is at the top of all ministers in terms of keeping cash
 unke paas 65 lakh rupee cash tha
 In second place is Shripad Naik, Minister of State (independent), with 22 lakh and Hansraj Ahir, Minister of State (home) with 10 lakh
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki unke paas 89,700 rupee nakad hai
 23 ministers had cash of less than Rs 2 lakh, while 15 had 2
 5 lakh se zyada cash tha

 The board is considering introducing a 'power player' rule in the next edition of the league
 is niyam ke tahat team match main kabhi bhi wicket girane ke baad yaa over khatm ke baad khilaadi ko badal sakati he
 a senior BCCI official told IANS that the idea has been approved, but it will be discussed in detail at the IPL Governing Council meeting to be held at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai on Tuesday
 antim-11 ke bajaae 15 khilaadi chunane kaa plansdhikari ne kaha, 'ham aisi sthiti par vichaar kar rahe hai jahaan tiimon ko antim-11 ke bajaae 15 khilaadiyon ko chunanaa ho or ek khilaadi ko match ke dauraan kabhi bhi wicket girane ke baad yaa over khatm hone ke baad badla ja sake
 We are thinking of bringing it in the IPL, but it would be right to implement this rule in the upcoming Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy
 'adhikari se jab poocha gaya isse match par kis tarah kaa asar hoga, to unhone kaha ki yah niyam match kaa nateeja badal saktaa he or donon tiimon ke liye hatakar sochane tathaa ranneeti banane ko badhaava degaa
 This rule can be changed in such a way that the result of the match said, "think you need 20 runs from six balls and Andre Russell is sitting out, because he was not fully fit and was not part of the final-11"
 lekin ab is niyam se vah aisi sthiti main maidan par aa sakate hai or bade shot lagaakar match badal sakate hai
 He said, "similarly, if you have to save six runs in the last over and you have a player like Jaspreet Bumrah sitting in the dug-out, what will the captain do? He will bring Bumrah after the 19th over is over and then you know
 is niyam main match ko badalane kaa dam he
 In addition to this rule, members will review the 2019 IPL in the IPL Governing Council meeting
 saath hi is baat par bhi charchaa hogi ki aagaamee sijan ko or lokapriy kaise banaaya jaae
 Upset complaints about the ranking of Swachh Survekshan are in the 25 cleanest cities, eight cities of Madhya Pradesh are being fraudulent in the name of ranking of cities in the Swachh Bharat Mission, the biggest project of the Modi government?

 PM Modi arrived in Janakpur, Nepal at 30 am
 iske baad pradhanmantri sidhe janaki mandir ravaanaa hue, jahaan unhone vidhi-vidhaan ke saath puja archana kii
 After the puja, PM Modi gave a speech and launched the Friendship Bus Service between janakpur-ayodhya
 is dauraan piem modi ne kaha ki bharat or janakapur kaa naata atoot he or main saubhagyashaalee hum, jo mata janaki ke charnon main aane kaa mauka mila
 PM said the historic moment PMM Modi said in his address, 'this is a historic moment that the Prime Minister of Nepal himself came here from Kathmandu and welcomed me
 main nepal sarkaar kaa, rajya sarkaar or nagar sarkaar kaa or aadarneey piem kaa aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 The honor that Nepal has given is a tradition of thousands of years and respect of 125 crore Indians
 'isse aage piem modi ne kaha, 'sabase zyada growth aaj ke vakt main tourism kaa he
 The Ramayana circuit is a great example for crores of travelers from both countries
 isse tourism ko badhaava milegaa
 Both countries are starting this together
 ajjanakpur-ayodhya sidhi basseva kaa prarambh ho rahaa he, main iske liye bhi nepal ke piem kaa aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 This step will be very important in enhancing the relations between the citizens of both countries
 'bataur pradhanmantri ye narendra modi kaa teesraa nepal daura he
 He said that it is a pleasure for me that the bus service of Janakpur is being started from Ayodhya, UP, which made me Prime Minister
 isse pehle jab piem modijanaki mandirki ore gaye to raste main log bharat or nepal kaa jhanda lekar khadey najar aae
 Not only this, slogans of modi-modi and Janaki Mata ki Jai were also raised there
 aligarh ke esaspi ajay sahani se jab poocha gaya ki kya aapke star se aisa koi aadesh tha ki media ko phonkar bulaayaa jaae? kya aapke piaaro ne media ko phone kiya? to unhone kaha ki nahin, aisa koi aadesh nahin he ki phone karke sabko bulaayaa jaae

 madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke parinaam abhi raftaar pakad hi rahe the ki bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee narendra modi ne shivaraj singh chouhan ko phir se jeet hasil karne kii badhai de di
 The BJP was ahead in the election results of the four states, but Modi had to make the first call to Shivraj, the soft spoken, accessible to the people of Madhya Pradesh
 darasal pichley aath saal main chouhan ne bhagava party main apni haisiyat itani badha lee he ki unka kad modi ke baraabar na sahi to unase kam bhi nahin dikhataa
 He is a leader whose Congress had made the most strategy to defeat him and left all his satraps to surround him
 lekin obisi jati or maamuli kisaan parivaar se raajnneeti ke shikhar par pahunche shivaraj ne congress ko puri tarah chaka diya
 It is not that he has only cut the net of the Congress, he has also handled his party's treachery and factionalism
 aage rahakar netritv karne kii unki adaa tab saamne ai jab kaddavar netaa raghavji ke sex scandle main funsane ke baad unki paaramparik vidisha vidhansabha seat se mukhyamantri ne khud ko vidhansabha pratyaashee bana diya
 His morale is that when the national leaders of the party could not think of going a step without Modi, then he kept himself ahead in the election campaign of Madhya Pradesh and Modi's picture could not move beyond a formal appearance
 chunaav jeetne ke baad unhone daawa kiya ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main anupatik rup se sabase zyada siten madhya pradesh jitegaa
 Shivraj, who has visited at least five days a week in the rough terrain of the state, is a devotee of Shivji and arrived in Ujjain with his wife to offer Mahakaala before the election results
 ve aasthaa ke rajnatik istemaal ke bhi parkhi hai
 When required, they wear the white cap of Croatia and start the Mukhyamantri Teerth Darshan Scheme
 ve shaayad iklaute netaa hai jo jansabhaon main hone vaale bhaashanon main apni yojanaon or vikaas ke aankadon ko aisi muhaavareydaar bhashaa main pesh karte hai ki sankhyikee kavita jaisi sugam ban jaati he
 His same practices are making him the secular alternative to Narendra Modi within the party in the coming Lok Sabha elections
