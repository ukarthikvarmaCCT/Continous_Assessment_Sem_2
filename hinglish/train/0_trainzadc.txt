 com / xatfupbynk The fight between US President Donald Trump and news channels is not new
 raashtrapati chunaav ke prachaar ke dauraan media par barasane vaale trump ne is baar sienen channel par apana gussa nikaala he
 Trump on CNN International, the global broadcast arm of the news channel, alleged that this news channel does not present a true picture of his administration
 unhone twit karte hue kaha ki 'sienen duniya ke saamne america ko behad galat tareeke se pesh kar rahaa he'
 
 @foxnewsis MUCH more important in the United States than CNN, but outside of the U
 S
 , CNN International is still a major source of (fake) news, and they represent our Nation to the WORLD very poorly
 The outside world does not see the truth from them! - Donald j Trump (@realdonaldtrump)november 25, 2017raashtrapati trump ne kaha ki america main fox news, sienen se zyada ahm ho gaya he, lekin america se baahar sienen international ab bhi aisi (farji) khabaron kaa strot bana hua he
 The US president spent his Thanksgiving weekend in mar-a-lago, Florida
 purana he media se jhagadatrump da neuyark times, sienen, da washington post samet mukhyadhara ke kai americamedia sangathnonke katu aalochak rahe hai
 The US president had also accused the news channels of reducing the number of crowds at his swearing-in ceremony
 is baar unhone kaha ki yah channel galat tasviir pesh karata he yahi vajah he ki baahar kii duniya unke jariye sachai nahin dekh paati
 CNN has also responded immediately to this
 channel ne diya javabachanal ke jansampark acount se twit kiya gaya, ‘duniya ke saamne america ko pesh karne kaa kaam sienen kaa nahin he
 That's your business
 hamaara kaam khabaron kii report dena he
 Soon cnn's top journalists came out in defense of their co-operatives
 channel ke tamaam sadasyon ne bachaav karte hue media kii jimmedaari or kartavyon ke bare main kai baaten likhi hai
 a Pakistan court has ordered the administration to remove the name of former military ruler Pervez Musharraf from the 'exit control' list, paving the way for his exit
 suchi se apana naam baahar karne sambandhi murshraf ke anurodh par sunwaayee karte hue sindh hoicourt main nyaayamurti mohammad ali mazhar or nyaayamurti shahanvaj kii do sadasyeey peeth ne yah aadesh jari kiya
 The 70-year-old Musharraf, who is facing multiple cases along with a case under the sedition law, had filed a petition in the Sindh High Court to remove his name from the Exit Control List (ECL), in the UAE, to see his ailing mother
 To go for sarkaar ne yachika kaa virodh karte hue kaha ki agar unhen baahar jane kii anumati di jaati he to vah faraar ho sakate hai
 Asiya Ishaq of All Pakistan Muslim League said, it is true that there is no problem now when his (musharraf) goes out of the country
 lekin abhi vah turant desh chhodkar nahin jaaenge
 Asiya said that after such a decision of the court, the prosecution has time to go to the Supreme Court for an appeal for 15 days
 unhone kaha ki musharraf is avadhi kaa intjaar karenge
 On April 5 last year, he was named in the ECL, due to which he will have to stay in the country and he will be present in all the cases where he is named
 isiel main kisi kaa naam hone par vah bina anumati ke desh chhodkar nahin ja sakate hai
 Later Musharraf's lawyer Farooq Nasim told reporters that the court order in favor of his client proves that the pending case against the former president is politically motivated
 naseem ne kaha ki adaalat se unhone kaha ki aisa nahin he ki unke muvakkil kaa pakistan lautne kaa iraadaa nahin he
 The bench said that the federal government has 15 days to appeal against the decision to remove Musharraf's name from the list
 khaas baat yah thi ki abhiyojan ke vakil sunwaayee ke vakt adaalat main upasthit nahin the
 This year was the last day of May, when the idea of the United Janata Alliance was in its infancy
 tab argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav or sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ke saath apane gathbandhan ko majboot karne ke liye bulaai gai ek baithak main jedy(you) netaa nitish kumaar nahin gaye the
 After this, he did not go to a joint rally with Lalu in Patna
 baad main unhone apni party ke pradesh adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh se ghoshnaa karvaa di ki gathbandhan nahin ho rahaa he
 If you want, you can call it the effect of heat, or a political game of pressure to the end
 un dinon aisa lag rahaa tha ki nitish or lalu ek-duusare ko aankh milakar nahin dekh sakate
 But on October 16, when voters were standing in queues in 32 assembly constituencies during the second phase of voting, the heat of their displeasure for each other seemed to be the emeralds of a buried book
 us din dopaher main, raghopur nirvachan kshetra ke bidupur hyskool main argedy ummidavaar ke paksh main chunaav prachaar karne aayaa vyakti or koi nahin, bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar the or unhen 25 varshiya argedy ummidavaar ne teen baar apana 'chachaa' kahkar pukaara
 In fact, the candidate from here and Lalu's younger son Tejashwi Yadav took this opportunity so seriously that he went on to give a speech long after the time for the meeting was over
 aakhirkaar party ke ek netaa ko unke kaan main yah kahana padaa ki ab bhaashan khatm karnaa padegaa, kyonki nitish ko patna lautnaa he, or helicopter andhere main udaan nahin bhar saktaa he
 When Nitish finally stood up to give a speech, he stressed the unity of the Grand Alliance before talking about his development goals
 nitish ne ghoshnaa kii ki tejasvi ke raghopur se chunaav ladaane kaa faisla akele lalu ne nahin liya he, ''yah meraa bhi faisla tha
 "and in one stroke, he was seen telling both the bjp-led NDA and the voters that the dragging which took place in the RJD-JD (U) alliance in the early days had been swept away in the Ganges much earlier
 Is, which flows from Raghopur
 yah bihar ke is blockbster chunaav ke pehle do charnon kii kahani he
 And nitish-lalu's coming together or at least being seen together is seen as the biggest reason for the sudden belief in Janata alliance camp
 lalu main najar aa rahe nae josh kaa kaaran bhi yahi he
 An elderly Yadav chief who had diligently coordinated Tejashwi's election meeting at Bidupur school by giving instructions on the microphone, till Nitish reached the stage, got a taste of it that evening
 ve tejasvi ke kafile ke saath, rajya kii rajdhani patna main 10, circular road par lalu ke darbar main bhaagate hue pahunche
 He said to Lalu Yadav with satisfaction and clearly proud voice, "he has come from Raghopur, has organized a tremendous rally
 '' lekin shaam kii apni duusari neembu-chaay pite lalu ne kadakadaati aawaaj main unhen jawaab diya, ''aaie, mere maathaa par baith jaaie
 Pull out the chair and sit in the back row
 ''yah us puraane lalu kii akad thi, jo 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main baari haar ke baad kho-si gai lag rahi thi, jisamen yadav voton kaa ek bada hissaa narendra modi kii lahar main bah gaya tha
 But politics has changed dramatically in the last nearly a month
 jab jamini soochnaaon se yah sanket mila ki jin 81 siton par matdaan puraa ho gaya he, vahaan lalu or nitish ek duusare ke ummidavaaron ko apane vot sthanantarit karaane main safal rahe hai, to lalu waapas apane form main aa gaye
 Until just two months ago, he was seen requesting people of his caste to unite
 rajya main yadav matadaata kareeb 14 pratishat hai
 Now the Yadavs are asked to pull the chair and sit back, they are destined after a long journey
 lekin agar lalu vaapasi karte lag rahe hai, to iskaa kaaphi shrey nitish ko milanaa chahie
 a decade ago, in the October 2005 assembly elections, Nitish had once marginalized and defeated his fellow Lalu
 or ab unheen ke saath aane ke baad lalu ko kisi samay bahut charchit muslim-yadav gathjod waapas apane paksh main aata dikhaa he
 If this alliance decides to vote together, as it did when first Lalu and then Rabri Devi ruled in Bihar, then this alliance of about 31 percent of the state's voters could prove decisive
 ise thos rup lene main kuch samay laga he
 After their defeat in the general election, they were in such a serious state of disguise that Lalu and Nitish were forced to forget their decade-long rivalry
 or aakhirkaar ek saal se kuch adhik samay baad sari chijen is jodi ke paksh main jane lagi hai
 Lalu no longer lashes out at Nitish, his trademark satirical taunt, and neither feels embarrassed to be seen with Nitish Lalu
 balki ve apekshaakrit samaan str par baat bhi kar rahe hai
 That afternoon when Nitish went to attack the BJP at the Bidupur School, he was almost reading a speech written for Lalu
 mohan bhagwat kii haal kii doharaai gai is tippanee par hamalaa karte hue ki aarakshan niti kii samiksha kii jaani chahie or yah sunishchit karne ke liye is par bahes kii jaani chahie ki vastav main iskaa laabh use mili, jise isaki jarurat ho, nitish ne kaha ki aresas pramukh aarakshan chhinana chaahate hai
 He insisted that but we will not let this happen
 ek ahm akalan yah he ki agar lalu-nitish kii chemistry kaam karti najar aa rahi he, to iske dosha kaa bada hissaa bhagwat ke bayaan ko diya janaa chahie
 Nitish and Lalu have cleverly used this statement in election campaign speeches to create confusion among a section of Dalits, backward and other backward classes, to remove Mahadalit Jitan Ram Manjhi from the post of Chief Minister
 Was angered by JD (U) after K's decision
 yahaan tak ki bijepi ke netaa bhi nijee taur par maanate hai ki bhagwat ke bayaan ne spasht rup se endie ke liye aasaan lag rahi jeet kii sambhaavna main adnga laga diya he
 "it has made most of the backward classes restless," says a leader
 haalanki yah kahani kaa ek hi hissaa he
 "he says," but this perception, in the media as well as among the people, seems to be made up of the fact that Lalu's supporters are always vocal about which way their votes will go
 ati pichhadaa varg hamaare saath he
 Ajay Yadav, owner of a nursery in Vaishali, says that the biggest thing in favor of Nitish Kumar is that no one is angry with him
 ve kehete hai, ''yahaan tak ki chunaav abhiyaan kii garmi main bhi unke khilaaf kai logon ke paas bolne ke liye kuch bhi nahin he
 "NDA leaders may have a lot to speak against Lalu Yadav, but to get something out of that, they have to get out of the caste-corruption-jungle raj line and present things anew
" argedy adhyaksh lalu ke thos samarthakon main, jo badi sankhya main ekajute ho rahe hai, aarope, aarope-patr or yahaan tak ki sajaa bhi, myne nahin rakhti he
 a post shared by Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) on Nov 14, 2017 at 12:24 pm PST ye sawaal ek aisa sawaal he jiskaa jawaab kai baar logon ne google se jaanane kii koshish kii he
 Most people wash their hair twice a week
 kuch logon kii aadat baalo ko roj dhone kii hoti he
 So some people also conditioner hair daily
 vaise to aisa koi niyam nahin he ki baalo ko kab or kaise dhoen
 But washing hair properly can keep your hair beautiful and healthy for long time
 garmi main kaise rakhe baalo kaa khyalmote or ghunghraale bal to kaaphi samay tak na dhone par bhi bejaan nahin lagate
 But light and thin hair looks lifeless if not washed for a long time
 to ye aapke baalo par depend karata he ki aap baalo ko kab or kaise dhoen
 If you have curly hair, you do not need to wash it daily
 vahiin agar aapke bal oili hai to aap hafte main do baar apane baalo ko dho sakati hai
 Washing hair daily can make your hair dry and lifeless
 baalo ko roj dhone se aapke scalp main maujuud tel suukh jaataa he or baalo ko bejaan bana detaa he
 You can also use dry shampoo in oily hair
 baalo kii safai jaruri he
 Washing the hair at the right time and the right way, along with cleaning the hair, you can maintain its beauty
 mohan bhagwat ne kaha he ki ram janmabhumi par hi mandir banegaa, mandir ke alaava vahaan kuch nahin banegaa

 kya bhartiya sena itani kangaali main he ki wo apane javaanon ke liye vardi bhi nahin kharid sakati? aisi hi baat kuch media reports main kahi gai he jo soshal media par viral ho rahi hai

 The August 2, 2017 memorandum of the Ministry of Finance shows that changes were made last year regarding the supply of uniforms so that the recommendations of the Seventh Central Pay Commission could be implemented
 in siforeeshon ke mutabik, vardi or dress se sambandhit vibhinn tarah ke bhatte muhaiyaa karaane ke system ko salanaa die jane vaale ek samahit ‘dress alouns’ se badla jayega
 The order (point number 3) clearly states that those categories of staff who were earlier provided uniforms will no longer be given uniforms
 ye aadesh 1 july, 2017 se prabhaav main aayaa
 According to the memorandum, the Army / IAF / Navy / capfs / cpos RPF / RPSS / IPS / Coast Guard will get a dress allowance of Rs 20,000 per year and military personnel below the rank of officers will get Rs 10,000 annually
 ye dress alouns har saal july ke vetan main jud kar milegaa
 Whenever dearness allowance increases by 50 percent, dress allowance will be increased by 25 percent
 ye alouns sirf buniyadi vardi se sambandhit he

 The reports tried to give the impression that “due to lack of funds, the army has decided to cut supplies from government ordinance factories
 ye kadam isliye uthaaya gaya he ki is par kharch kiye jane vaale paise ko chote gahan yuddh ke liye jaruri ahm golabarood or anya sazosaman kii aapurti ke liye istemaal kiya ja sake
 “this example of supply cuts from ordinance factories is also misleading
 ordinance factriyon se aapurti main katautee kaa faisla beete saal april main liya gaya tha
 The Defense Production Department in its letter dated 27 April 2017 stated the real reasons behind it
 chitthee main saaf taur par kaha gaya he ki do cametiyon kii siforeeshon par ye faisla kiya gaya ki ordinance factriyon se non-core vastuon kii utpaadan suvidhaon ko yaa to band kar diya jaae yaa pipipi model par de diya jaae
 These committees were formed to suggest to increase the efficiency of ordinance factories
 chittheemen kaha gaya he ki ab se sena ke liye ye anivaary nahin rah jayega ki wo 143 non-core vastuon kii kharid ordinance factriyon se hi kare
 Open tenders can also be issued for these in which Ordinance Factory Board (OFB) can also participate

 or unase jaraa hatakar, dayee ore, ek aadmi khaaki-se kapade pahane, apane juuton kaa sirhaana banaae, ghaas par leta hua mutvaatar khans rahaa he
 The first time i coughed, i felt bad
 chalis-pantalis varsh kaa kurup-sa aadmi, safed chote-chote bal, kaala, jhaaiyon-bharaa cheharaa, lambe-lambe daant or kandhe aage ko jhuke hue, khansata jaataa or paas hi ghaas par thukta jaataa
 i could not stop maine kaha, ''suna he, vilaayat main sarkaar ne jagah-jagah pikdaan laga rakhe hai, taaki logon ko ghaas-paudhon par na thukna pade
 "he looked at me, stared for a moment, then said," Sir, there would not be such a cough
 ’’ phir khaansaa, or muskaraata hua bolaa, 'badi naamuraad beemaari he, isamen aadmi ghulata rahata he, marataa nahin
 'I listened unheard, took the newspaper out of my pocket and started looking
 par kuch der baad kanakhiyon se dekha, to vah mujh par takataki baandhe muskaraa rahaa tha
 i left the newspaper, "do you do business?" "when we used to do business, cough did not bother me like this
" ’’''kya karte the?’’us aadmi ne apane donon haathon kii hatheliyaan mere saamne khol deen
 i saw, there were three fingers cut between his right hand
 vah bolaa, ''mashin se cat gayi
 Where do i get new fingers now? Wherever you go, the owner asks for the full ten fingers, laughing as he says
 ''pehle kahan kaam karte the?’’''kalka workshaap main
 "we both fell silent again
 uski ramakahani sunne ko meraa ji nahin chahta tha, bahut-si ramakahaniyaan sun chukaa tha
 He kept looking at me for a while, then lay down with his hands on his chest
 main bhi letkar akhbaar dekhne laga, magar thakaa hua tha, isliye main jaldi hi so gaya
 When my sleep was broken, a slow conversation was going on near me, "tikon is formed here, where age line and heart line meet
 dekha? tumhen kahin se dhan milanevaala he
 "I opened my eyes
" vahi dame kaa rogi ghaas par baitha, ungliyaan kate haath kii hatheli ek jyotishi ke saamne failaae apni kismat puch rahaa tha
 "don't talk logically, read what is written in the hand
" ’’''idhar anguthe ke neeche bhi ticon banati he
 Your forehead is very clean, you will definitely get money
 ’’''kab?’’''jaldi hi
 “on the spot, he slapped the cheek of the astrologer
 jyotishi tilamila gaya
 When will you get the money? Money will be received! i have been lying on my brother's pieces for three years, he says, "we will get money!" The astrologer started to pick up his paper and went, but Yajaman pulled his wrist and sat down, "I have told you sweet things, now what is written, Tell that, i will not say anything
 ’’jyotishi koi bees-baees varsh kaa yuvak tha
 Black face, white kurta and pajama which was stitched from place to place
 baatcheet ke dhang se bengali jaan padataa tha
 First, he panicked and then took Yajman's hand on his palm and kept reading the silent language of the lines
 phir dhire se bolaa, ''tere bhagya-rekha nahin he
 "yajaman laughed on hearing," Don't say so, why does he hide? Where is the fate line? "" Here, it goes from here to that finger
 ’’''bhagya-rekha nahin he to dhan kahan se milegaa?’’''dhan jarur milegaa
 If you are not there, the line of your family will be good
 uskaa bhagya tuje milegaa
 This happens also
 ’’''thik he, usee ke bhagya par to ab tak ji rahaa hoon
 He has left his four children and gone his way
 ’’jyotishi chup ho gaya
 Both of them started looking at each other's mouth
 phir yajmaan ne apana haath khinch liya, or jyotishi ko bolaa, ''tu apana haath dikhaa
 "the astrologer shrugged, but seeing no means to get rid of him, opened his palm in front of him," Is this your fate line? "" Yes
 ’’''tera bhagya to bahut acha he
 How many Bengalis do you have? "the astrologer closed his palm and then started saving the book," Sit here
 kab se yah dhandha karne laga he?’’jyotishi chup
 The asthma patient asked, "where has it come from?" ’’''sharnaarthi he?’’''haan
 "" Was this business before? "the astrologer then kept quiet
 tanaav kuch dhilaa padane laga
 Yajaman said softly, "what will we get from you!" Go, see the hand of a motorist
 ’’jyotishi ne sir hilaayaa, ''vah kahan dikhaate hai! jo do paise milte hai, tumhiin jaison se
 "the sun had fallen behind the tree in front
 itane main paanch-saat chaparasi saamne se aae or ped ke neeche baith gaye, ''ja, unka haath dekh
 Their pockets will not be empty
 ’’magar jyotishi sahamaa-sa baitha rahaa
 Suddenly the population of the garden started increasing
 nile kurte-pajame pahane, logon kii kai toliyaan, ek-ek karke ain, or paas ke footpath par baithne lageen
 Then a blue lorry came in, and stopped in front of the garden
 usamen se pandraa-bees latthdhari pulisavaale utre or sadak ke paar ek qatari main khadey ho gaye
 Tension started coming in the garden air
 rahgeer police ko dekhakar rukne lage
 Some laborers also gathered under the trees
 ''log kisalie jamaa ho rahe hai?’’ jyotishi ne yajmaan se poocha
 "you don't know?" Today is May Day, Labor Day
 ’’phir yajmaan gambheer ho gaya, ''aaj ke din mazdooron par goli chali thi
 "the number of laborers kept increasing
 or mazdooron ke saath khomchevale, malai, baraf, moongfalee, chaat, chabenewale bhi aan pahunche, or gum-ghumkar sauda bechney lage
 Noise was heard from the city
 baag se log daud-daudkar footpath par ja khadey hue
 The soldiers stood across the road, dressed in sticks
 juluus aa rahaa tha
 Slogans were echoing
 hawa main tanaav bad rahaa tha
 People standing on the pavement also started shouting slogans
 police kii ek or lari aa lagi, or latthdhari sipaahi kud-kudakar utre
 "today sticks will go
" ’’ yajmaan ne kaha
 But nobody gave any answer
 sadak ke donon ore bheed jam gai
 The movement of passengers stopped
 shaharwaali sadak par se ek juluus baag kii taraf badhata hua najar aayaa
 The footpaths also started visiting him
 itane main do or juluus alag-alag disha se baag kii taraf aane lage
 The crowd started getting excited
 majdoor baag ke saamne aath-aath kii line banaakar khadey hone lage
 Slogans started echoing in the sky, and thousands of people started reaching thousands
 saare shahar kii dhadkan maano isi bheed main punjeebhoot ho gai ho! kai juluus milakar ek ho gaye
 The workers raised the flag and started moving forward
 pulisavaalon ne laathiyaan uthaa leen or saath-saath jane lage
 Then that huge procession started moving slowly
 kanat sarakas kii maldaar, dhuli-puti deevaaron ke saamne vah anokhaa lag rahaa tha, jaise nile akaash main sahamaa andhiyaare badal karavatein lene lagen! dhire-dhire chalata hua juluus us ore gum gaya jis taraf se police kii laariyaan ai thim
 The astrologer stood on top of the bench in his enthusiasm
 dame kaa rogi, ab bhi apni jagah par baitha, ekatak juluus ko dekh rahaa tha
 The echoes of the slogans started getting dim
 darshakon kii bheed bikhar gai
 Those who did not go with the procession went towards their homes
 baag par dhire-dhire dupahar jaisi hi nistabdhta chaane lagi
 At this point, a man, who was running fast across the garden towards the procession, passed by the front
 dublaa-sa aadmi, maili ganji or jaanghia pahane hue
 Yajman stopped him, "why friend, just come here
" ’’''kya he?’’''yah juluus kahan jayega?’’''pataa nahin
 Hear, Ajmeri Gate, Delhi will go to the Red Fort via the door, there will be Jalsa
 ’’''vahaan tak pahunchega bhi? yah latthdhari jo saath ja rahe hai, jo raste main gadabad ho gai to?’’''are, gadabad to hoti hi rahati he, to juluus rukegaa thode hi,’’ kahata hua vah aage bad gaya
 The patient kept staring at him till the procession disappeared
 phir jyotishi ke kandhe ko thapthapaata hua, uski aankhon main ankhen daalkar muskaraane laga
 The astrologer then hesitated, panicked
 yajmaan bolaa, ''dekha saale?’’''haan, dekha he
 "even now Yajaman's eyes were stuck in the direction of the procession
 phir muskaraate hue, apni ungliyaan-kati hatheli jyotishi ke saamne khol di, ''phir dekh hatheli, saale, tu kaise kahata he ki bhagya-rekha kamjor he?’’or phir baayein haath se chaati ko thame jor-jor se khansane laga

 He consoled me and told me nothing would happen to me and protected me For me that day a true hero was born

 vahiin, prastaav par purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh, pi chidambaram, virappa moili jaise varisht netaaon ke sin nahin hone par bhi bijepi ne congress par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 What is impeachment? Impeachment is used to remove judges of Supreme Court and High Court
 isi prakiya ke madhyam se raashtrapati ko bhi hataaya ja saktaa he
 The impeachment motion is brought when it appears that the people sitting in these posts are violating or abusing the Constitution
 agar aisa ho rahaa he to mahabhiyog kaa prastaav kisi bhi sadan main laayaa ja saktaa he
 It is mentioned in Articles 62, 124 (4), (5), 217 and 218 of the Constitution
 mahabhiyog kii prakriyamahaabhiyog prastaav kii prakiya ko behad jatil mana jaataa he
 Signature of 100 mps is required to bring this proposal in Lok Sabha
 vahiin, rajyasabha main ise laane ke liye 50 saansadon ke hastakshar chahie hote hai
 If it appears in the House, then the Speaker of the House will decide on it
 wo chahen to ise sweekaar kar len yaa ise khaarij bhi kar sakate hai
 If the chairman accepts the impeachment motion, a committee of three members will investigate the allegations
 is cameti main supreme court ke ek jaj, hoicourt ke ek chif justise or koi ek anya vyakti ko shaamil kiya jaataa he
 The impeachment motion will be debated in Parliament only if the allegations of the inquiry committee are true
 iske baad sansad ke donon sadanon main is prastaav kaa do tihaai bahumat se paarit hona jaruri he
 If this motion is passed in both the houses, then it will be sent to the President for approval
 bataa den ki kisi bhi jaj ko hataane kaa adhikaar sirf raashtrapati ke paas he

 They are offered two seats by the NDA

 Bhaiyyuji Maharaj, the spiritual leader of Indore, is also taking a sigh of relief after Gandhian activist Anna Hazare's 12-day fast broke out, who suddenly 'emerged' as an arbitrator in the complex issue of the strong Lokpal Bill
 anna ne majboot lokapal vidheyak kii teen pramukh maangon par sansad kii saidhantik sahmati ke baad kal 28 agast ko apana anshan todaa
 Uday Singh Deshmukh, 43, popularly known as' Bhaiyyuji Maharaj 'among his followers, said,' i am happy and contented that i was able to play a role in addressing this issue of national importance
 ’ gaiyr raajnneetik prishthbhumi vaale bhaiyuji ke desh ke alag-alag siyaasi netaaon se madhur sambandh hai or vah anna ke bhi najadik maane jate hai
 His debut as an intermediary in the historical mass tide issue in the country, however, was seen with different views in the media
 lekin unka daawa he ki vah madhyasthata ke liye ‘swechha se’ aage aaye the
 During the week of Anna's fast, the spiritual leader who had camped in Delhi for a week said, "I have taken care of the feelings of the government and Team Anna, and one with Dharya on both sides
 duusare kii baat pahunchaayi
 Bhaiyugi calls the arrest of a 73-year-old Gandhian activist on August 16, inherently scandalous, before Anna sat on hunger strike
 lekin is baat ko khaarij karte hai ki is masale main sarkaar ne shuruuaat main paryaapt lacheelaapan nahin dikhaaya
 Bhaiyugi, who once modeled for a brand of clothing, said, "I did not see the government's stubborn attitude and it seemed to be taking the initiative on the path of solution somewhere
" ’ unhone anna kii giraftaar ke baad kii sthitiyon kaa zikr karte hue kaha, ‘mere khyaal main yah aisa padaav tha, jahaan donon pakshon main kahin na kahin samvaad kii kami najar aayi
 But later, to address the issue of snow melt and Lokpal Bill, there was a thought that how to overcome the different deadlock
 ’aadhyatmik netaa ne is baat se bhi inkaar kiya ki sarkaar ne majboot lokapal vidheyak ko lekar desh bhar main jan bhaawanaaon ke jabardast ufaan ke baavjood is masale ke kuch thanda hone kaa intjaar kiya
 Bhaiyyuji said, 'on some things there can be differences between two brothers
 lekin main maanata hum ki is puure masale main sarkaar or team anna kaa rukh kul milakar sakaaratmak rahaa
 Both sides were committed (for solution)
 ’anna ke anshan ko ‘jepi andolan kaa aadhunik sanskaran’ qaraar dete hue unhone kaha, ‘bhrashtachar ke khilaaf janata ke man main lambe samay se aakrosh tha, jo anna kii aguwai main ahimsak andolan ke rup main phuta
 But i think the faith of the people has not been lifted from the Parliament, nor should it be so
 ’bhaiyuji kaa maananaa he ki desh main bhrashtachar par prabhavi ankush lagane ke liye sarkaar ko kadaa kanoon banane ke saath seva kshetra se atyadhik dabaav hataane or krishi aadhaarit udyogon ko badhaava dene kii disha main bhi thos kadam uthaane chahiyein

 Attacking the Congress on the issue of national security, he said that the former Congress government led by Manmohan Singh did nothing when Pakistan beheaded five Indian soldiers but during the Modi regime, airstrikes were carried out in Balakot

 ' unhone daawa kiya ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa cheharaa tab pilaa pad gaya tha jab modi sarkaar ne jeenyu main ‘‘bharat tere tukade honge, insha allaah insha allaah'' kaa naaraa lagane waalon ko jail main daal diya or ab unhone party ke ghoshnaptr main deshadroh ke praavdhaanon main sanshodhan kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 Amit Shah also said that this is the first time that the opposition did not make corruption an issue as it ended during the Modi government

 This warning at the gate of 5 Kalidas Marg has shocked many people
 kyonki yah vah jagah he jahaan na sirf log tasviren khinchvaate rahe hai, balki selfi bhi lete rahe hai
 Because of this, this order is not embracing the people

 That too when the road leading to the Chief Minister's residence is full

 Talented engineers in the country are coming from Delhi, Bihar and Jharkhand, while in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, engineers are relatively less employable

 He said, 'it is clear that states need to be conscious about better education quality rather than just increasing capacity
 ’desh main enginiirang collejon kii sankhya jis tareeke se bad rahi he, vah khatarnaak he or ejiniyaron main rojgaar kii kaabiliyat kam hone kaa ek pramukh kaaran he
 The report is based on 2013 graduates and includes data from more than 1,20,000 engineering students from 520 engineering colleges in 18 cities
 gujarat main chunavi jang maidan par logon ke bich to jari hi he, soshal media main bhi ise lekar jabardast bavaal machaa hua he
 In fact, parties are putting too much emphasis on the use of social media

 campan main police dwaara lathicharge karne kii tasveeron or pradarshnakariyon ko lagi choton ko pradarshit kiya gaya he
 The punchline of this campaign launched on social media by the Patidars against the BJP has been kept as 'how to forget'
 hardik patel gujarat main jahaan kahin bhi aarakshan kii maang ke saath jansabha ko sambodhit karne ja rahe hai, vahaan vah ek baat jarur bolte hai ki maa, bahan or bhaaiyon par sarkaar ke nirdesh par police dwaara bhanji gai laathiyon ko kabhi mat bhoolanaa
 Hardik repeatedly tells in his public meetings that how the Patidars were attacked at the behest of the government, how the police used lathis on the Patidar youth, never forget it
 gauratlab he ki gujarat main patidaar samudaay kii aabaadi acchhee khaasi he or hardik kaa samarthan hasil kar congress patidaaron ko apane paale main kar satta main lautnaa chaahati he
 It is worth noting that after Hardik Patel's Kranti Rally, the police had lashed out at the protesters of the Patidar community, in which 14 persons were also killed
 patidaaron par atyaachaar kaa maamla tab itnaa garmaya tha ki tatkaaleen mukhyamantri anandiben patel ko istifa dena padaa tha
 There is a dress code for women in Saudi Arabia

 darasal, angela mercel duniya kii un kuch netaaon main shaamil hai, jinhone apane desh main burka pratibandhit kar diya he
 According to Angela Merkel, the custom of wearing a burqa or being covered from head to toe is not in her German culture, so she cannot go against her culture
 germany main burka bain karne ke baad pehali baar saudi pahunchi mercel, nahin dhakaa sitapane desh main burke par pabandi lagane ke dauraan mercel ne kaha tha ki yah unke desh main bilkul bhi sweekaarya nahin he, or jahaan bhi sambhav ho sake, vahaan par is par bain laganaa chahie
 In such a situation, putting a scarf on Angela's head could question her own decision
 angela mercel kaa yah kadam duniyabar ke un deshon ke liye sabak he, ja mahilaon kii suraksha ke naam par unke astitv par hi sawalia nishaan uthaate hai
 Standing apart from the crowd, Merkel believes in women's empowerment and believes that women have the right to live on their own terms
 angela mercel un sharnaarthiyon ke liye madad maangane saudi arab pahunchi thim, jo haal hi main syria, iraq, libya, afghanistan aadi se europe pahunche hai

 Seeing the picture of the yajna, you also invoke the gods and goddesses, but listen to me carefully
 uttarakhand ke udyaan vibhaag ne agast 2016 main 95 padon ke liye bharti nikaali
 For this, eleven thousand students filled the forms by giving Rs 300-300
 tay hua ki pariksha hogi 14 may 2017 ko lekin nahin hui
 Then it was decided that the exam would be held on 15 October 2017 but did not take place
 ye paise sarkaar ke paas zabt ho gaye
 Till date the government has not returned
 ab ayog ne ek or khel kiya
 The number of posts was increased from 95 to 198 and recruitment advertisement came out on 17 November 2017
 is baar phir se 12 hazaar chaatro ne 300-300 rupee dekar farm bhare
 That is, they gave 600 rupees to fill the form
 yah pariksha 10 janvari 2018 ko honi thi, magar radd ho gai
 Now again it has been said that recruitment of 308 posts will be released
 yah game har rajya main dekhne ko mila he
 The number of posts is increased for the next time when the exam is canceled
 farm ke paise le liye jate hai magar pariksha nahin hoti he or hoti bhi he to riselt nahin aayaa bas padon kii sankhya badha badha kar naujavaanon ko ummid bechi ja rahi he

 They gather daily in the parade ground, shout slogans and when they watch TV in the evening, they do not see their news
 12000 logon kii zindagi se judi khabar ko media main jagah nahin he, iskaa matlab he ki media zarur kuch bada kaam kar rahaa he

 beatisi kaa matlab hua basic trend teacher
 He teaches in first to fifth class
 rajya main alag-alag jagahon par beatisi centre bane hai jahaan merit ke aadhaar par ye chune jate hai or padhaane ke liye training di jaati he
 There are five thousand fees for training of BTC
 do saal kaa course hota he ye
 After this, students pass the TET test, Tate means Teacher Eligibility Test in English, Teacher Eligibility Test in Hindi
 iske baad jab sarkaar bhartee nikaalati he to beatisi or tet ke aadhaar par merit list banati he
 The government has not recruited BTC teachers since 2012
 upi ke beatisi paatrata vaale noujvaan jagah jagah pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Tweeting day and night on Twitter, when will we show our issue
 mantriyon ko bhi twit karte hai
 They say that in 2016 there were advertisements for 12,460 posts

 On 18 March, the cutoff of all the districts went and merit list was made
 lekin 23 march ko yogi sarkaar ne in bhartiyon par roak laga di
 Since then these youngsters have been performing on every occasion
 yahaan tak ki 16 july 2017 se teen sitambar 2017 tak dhai maheene lakhanu ke lakshmana mela maidan main dharna bhi diya
 Now these candidates have gone to court

 On November 3, the court ordered the government to reinstate them in two months
 adaalat ke aadesh ke baad bhi do maheene biit gaye hai or in chaatro ko pataa nahin ki kya hoga
 The government has now moved against the order of single bench to double bench
 tippaniyan 12,460 youth of Uttar Pradesh feel that after mentioning in prime time the appointment letter will be received, the government will change its mind
 kitna acha ho agar aisa ho jaae
 We would like to express our gratitude to the Minister of the Department concerned with this

 The young men who came there got angry and there was a lot of uproar

 BSP MLA n Mahesh was absent in the trust vote today, violating the party high command's directive to vote in support of the Kumaraswamy government in Karnataka which is an indiscipline which the party has taken very seriously and therefore expelled Mr Mahesh from the party with immediate effect Given
 isse pehle karnataka main congress-jedies gathbandhan kii sarkaar mangalvaar ko vidhansabha main vishwasamat hasil karne main vifal rahane ke baad gir gai
 With this, the term of Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, which has been facing a period of instability in the state for 14 months, came to an end
 kumaraswami ne vidhansabha main vishwaas prastaav haarane ke turant baad rajyapal vajubhai vaala ko apana istipha saunp diya
 Officials said that soon after the results, Kumaraswamy, Deputy Chief Minister
 parameshwar or anya varisht sahyogiyon ke saath rajbhavan gaye or istipha saunp diya
 It said in the resignation, 'with my cabinet i am resigning from the post of Chief Minister of Karnataka and i request you to accept it
 ' tyaagptr main kaha gaya, 'main is maukey par kaarykaal ke dauraan mujhe or mere sahyogiyon ko mili sahyog ke liye main abhaari hum
 'in his letter to Kumaraswamy, the Governor said,' i have accepted your resignation with immediate effect
 vaikalpik vyavastha hone tak kaaryvahak mukhyamantri ke pad par bane rahiye
 Needless to say that no executive decisions should be taken during this time
 ' isse pehle, vidhansabha main adhyaksh keaar ramesh kumaar ne elaan kiya ki 99 vidhayakon ne prastaav ke paksh main vot diya he, jabaki 105 sadasyon ne iske khilaaf mat diya he
 Thus this proposal fell
 bahes par jawaab dene ke baad mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami vichaarmagn avasthaa main kaarywahi dekhte rahe
 Kumaraswamy did not get the support of the numerical force and faced defeat after four days of discussion on the motion of confidence vote
 vidhansabha main pichley guuruuvaar ko unhone vishwaas mat kaa prastaav pesh kiya tha
 After discussing the motion of confidence in the assembly for four days, Kumaraswamy said, 'I am willing to sacrifice this post with joy
 ' kaarywahi main 21 vidhayakon ne hissaa nahin liya jisase sadan kii prabhavi kshamta ghatakar 204 rah gai
 mlas of congress-jds (17), BSP (one), Independents (two) did not attend the proceedings
 is tarah 103 kaa jaadui aankada nahin jute paaya
 Kumaraswamy said he had no intention of prolonging the trust vote proceedings
 unhone kaha, 'main vidhansabhadhyaksh or rajya kii janata se maafee maangata hum
 Kumaraswamy said, 'there is also a discussion that why i did not resign and why i am in the chair
 ' unhone kaha ki jab vidhansabha chunaav kaa parinaam (2018 main) aayaa tha, vah raajnneeti chhodane kii soch rahe the
 Kumaraswamy said, 'I came into politics suddenly and unexpectedly
 ' unhone kaha ki janata ke anukool sarkaar pradaan karne ke liye unhone eemaandaaree se kaam kiya
 Accusing the BJP of being in a hurry, he said, 'after the speech, i am not going to run anywhere
 logon ko pataa to chale ki kyon main hataa
 Fearing the figures, i am not running
 voton kii ginati hone dijie
 'the post of Chief Minister is not permanent for anyone
 udhar, matdaan ke baad vijay chinh banaate hue bhaajapa netaa bies yediurppa ne parinaam ko loktantr kii jeet bataaya
