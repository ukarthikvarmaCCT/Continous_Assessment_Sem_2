 - input IANS The problem of traffic jams in Delhi is not a problem today but it was created soon after Delhi became the new capital of the country
 tatkaaleen khufia beuro ke nideshak di petri to isse itane naaraaz ho gaye the ki unhone dilli ke mukhya ayukta ko gusse main chitthee tak likh daali thi
 The roads in the new capital of the country were made wide and magnificent, and during the 1930s, only a few cars, tangas, bullock carts, horse carts, sedan and pavement were seen on the roads, but in Delhi too
 Traffic management was a major problem
 us jamaane main intelegence beuro yani khufia beuro ke nideshak hote the di petri
 It is a matter of 1925
 ek din vah jam main itani buree tarah fanse ki gusse main unhone dilli ke mukhya ayukta i aar eboat ko gusse main ek patr tak likh daalaa
 Petri wrote in the letter, "traffic management in the capital is in very poor condition and a whole department is needed to handle it
 ’’ petri ne is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya tha ki bombai main bhi isi prakaar kaa trephic rahata he lekin vahaan halaat behatar he
 Hundreds of such documents can be seen in the National Archives from the 1920s in which various British authorities have mentioned the problem of traffic in Delhi
 aaj kii tarah hi us jamaane main bhi chambar aaf princej kii vashirk baithak nai dilli main yojit hone ke avasar par yatayaat kii samasya or vikaraal ho jaati thi
 Hundreds of princes and emir Umra from various princely states visited the capital to attend this meeting
 ye puure laav lashkar ke saath chalate the or apni aaleeshaan tathaa aaayaatit kaaron ke pradarshan kaa isse sunaharaa mauka unke liye or kya ho saktaa tha
 These wealthy Umrah All India War Memorial, that is, they lived in their huge houses or palaces around today's India Gate and say that the area of india Gate became very dangerous in terms of traffic due to the passing of their moving trains
 
 sena ke generalon kii gaadiyaan bhi yatayaat kii samasya main ijapha kar detii thim
 Petri's suggestion was acted upon as the situation got out of control and in 1927 the traffic department was finally set up under a Superintendent of Police, but the problem remains as it is today

 akhilesh yadav kii raajnneetik samaj kahen yaa phir sahajata unki har maukey par apane parivaar ko saath rakhana logon ko pasand aayaa he
 People have great respect for their family
 yahi vajah he ki party kii kharaab chhavi par akhilesh yadav kii saadagi or parivaar ke prati lagaav baari padaa he
 People believe that whenever Akhilesh Yadav was alone in politics, his wife Dimple Yadav stood behind him courageously
 pichley ek saal main dimple kaa akhilesh yadav ke saath har kathin maukey par dikhnaa logon ko pasand aayaa
 Dimple Yadav appeared with her every moment during such a big event in the party
 chunaav kii taiyaari main jab akhilesh yadav ne samaajawaadee party rathyatra nikaali thi tab is rath main unke parivaar ke kisi bade netaa ko nahin dekha gaya
 Dimple Yadav if seen
 shaayad is baat akhilesh yadav tabhi acchhee tarah samaj gaye the ki aisi yatra main aadhi aabaadi ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 This is the reason that Akhilesh Yadav made room for Dimple in that bus during the Rath Yatra
 party ke prachaar ke liye jari video main bhi akhilesh yadav ne dimple ke saath ke kuch pal saajha kiye(tasviir upar lagi he)
 When Akhilesh Yadav went out with his wife Dimple Yadav on a tour of the state, the message must have gone all over the state that this leader of the party is working to change and improve the image of the party
 yah kaam kiya hi nahin balki use jameen par utaara bhi
 The presence of Dimple Yadav along with Akhilesh Yadav in important party functions has also made the Samajwadi Party the task of taking many people to their homes and hearts
 party main akhilesh yadav ke saath dimple yadav kii sakriyata ne party kaaryakartaaon main dimple kii pakad ko majboot kiya he
 Party workers Akhilesh 'bhaiya' and Dimple 'bhabhi' slogans are now heard
 isse pehle shaayad hi kisi party main bhartiya samaaj ke hisaab se naare sunai die hon
 Dimple's simplicity and mildness have also increased her acceptance among the people
 haal hi main party kaa ghoshnaa-patr jari karne ke kaarykram main bhi bhale hi mulaayam singh yadav nahin pahunche hon, lekin manch par akhilesh ke saath dimple khadi dikhaai deen
 After winning the internal battle in the party, Akhilesh Yadav cut the tickets of those except the tickets of some special family members, due to which the party has been accused of patronizing the Bahubalis
 yah aalochana bhi he or tarif bhi ki kanoon vyavastha ko sudhaarney ke liye pichley chah maheene main jo kaam akhilesh yadav sarkaar ne kiya vah kaam vah pichley chaar saal main nahin kar pai thi
 It is the same history in state politics that no party accepts the anti-incumbency wave after being in power from anywhere and the opposition is also not trying to capitalize on this fact
 kaaran, akhilesh 'bhaiya' or dimple 'bhabhi'
 The comments is baar party vikaas ke agenda par chunaav lard rahi he or yahi kaam bijepi pichley do dashakon se kar rahi he
 It is said that she sees the Twitter and Facebook account of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on her own to get her husband's hand
 dimple yadav samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh, vidhaan mandal dal ke netaa va uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii dharmapatni to hai hi, lekin unki apni alag pahchaan bhi he
 He is an unopposed MP from Kannauj
 raajnneetik kshetra main pehla chunaav ve haar gayi lekin unhone himmat nahin haari
 Finally, her husband Akhilesh Yadav vacated the Kannauj Lok Sabha seat she won
 dimple ne is seat ke liye apana namakan patr daakhil kar diya
 In the contest, Congress, BJP and Bahujan Samaj Party did not field their candidates against them while two others, Dashrath Singh Shankwar (united Samajwadi Party) and Sanju Katiyar (independent candidates), withdrew their nominations
 jiskaa parinaam yah hua ki 2012 kaa lok sabha up-chunaav unhone nirvirodh jitkar uttar pradesh main ek kirtiman sthpit kiya
 Before Dimple, Purushottam Das Tandon won the Allahabad Western Lok Sabha seat of Uttar Pradesh in 1952 as a male candidate unopposed
 party ke mahatvapurn kaaryakramon main akhilesh yadav ke saath dimple yadav kii maujuudagi ne samaajawaadee party ko kai logon ko gharon main or dilon main pahunchane ke kaam bhi kiya he
 Dimple Yadav's activism with Akhilesh Yadav in the party has strengthened Dimple's hold among party workers
 party kaaryakarta akhilesh 'bhaiya' or dimple 'bhabhi' ke naare lagaate ab sunai dete hai
 Before this, hardly any party has heard slogans according to Indian society
 dimple kii saadagi or saumyata ne bhi logon main unki sweekaaryata ko badhaane kaa kaam kiya he
 Recently, even though Mulayam Singh Yadav has not reached the program of the party's manifesto, but Dimple was seen standing with Akhilesh on the stage
 party main andruni ladaai jeetne ke baad akhilesh yadav ne parivaar ke kuch khaas logon ke tikat ko chhodkar baaki un logon ke tikaton ko kaat diya jinaki vajah se party par bahubaliyon ko sangrakshan dene ke aarope lagate rahe
 It is also a criticism and praise that the work done by Akhilesh Yadav government in the last six months to improve law and order was not done in the last four years
 rajya kii raajnneeti main yah itihaas sa hi he ki koi party satta main hone ke baad sattavirohi lahar ke hone kii baat ko kahin se bhi nahin sweekaarti or vipaksh bhi is baat ko bhunaane kii purajor koshish nahin kar rahaa he
 Reason, Akhilesh 'bhaiya' and Dimple 'bhabhi'
 tippaniyan This time the party is contesting on the agenda of development and this is what BJP has been doing for the last two decades
 kaha jaataa he ki apane pati kaa haath bataane ke liye ve mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kaa twitor va fasebuk acount swayan dekhati hai
 Dimple Yadav is the wife of Samajwadi Party President, Leader of the Legislature Party and Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Akhilesh Yadav, but he also has his own identity
 vah kannauj se nirvirodh saansad hai
 She lost the first election in the political arena but did not lose heart
 antat: unke pati akhilesh yadav ne apane dwaara jiti gai kannauj loksabhaa seat unke liye khaali kar di
 Dimple filed his nomination papers for this seat
 mukaable main congress, bhaajapa or bahujan samaaj party ne unke khilaaf apana pratyaashee hi nahin utaara jabaki do anya, dasharath singh shankwaar (sanyukt samaajawaadee dal) or sanju katiyaar (swatantra ummidavaar) ne apana namakan waapas le liya
 As a result, he won the 2012 Lok Sabha by-election unopposed and established a record in Uttar Pradesh
 dimple se purv purushottam das tandon ne uttar pradesh kii elahabaad pashchimi loksabhaa seat san 1952 main ek purush pratyaashee main rup main nirvirodh jiti thi
 After winning the internal battle in the party, Akhilesh Yadav cut the tickets of those except the tickets of some special family members, due to which the party has been accused of patronizing the Bahubalis
 yah aalochana bhi he or tarif bhi ki kanoon vyavastha ko sudhaarney ke liye pichley chah maheene main jo kaam akhilesh yadav sarkaar ne kiya vah kaam vah pichley chaar saal main nahin kar pai thi
 It is the same history in state politics that no party accepts the anti-incumbency wave after being in power from anywhere and the opposition is also not trying to capitalize on this fact
 kaaran, akhilesh 'bhaiya' or dimple 'bhabhi'
 The comments is baar party vikaas ke agenda par chunaav lard rahi he or yahi kaam bijepi pichley do dashakon se kar rahi he

 Finally, her husband Akhilesh Yadav vacated the Kannauj Lok Sabha seat she won

 In the contest, Congress, BJP and Bahujan Samaj Party did not field their candidates against them while two others, Dashrath Singh Shankwar (united Samajwadi Party) and Sanju Katiyar (independent candidates), withdrew their nominations
 jiskaa parinaam yah hua ki 2012 kaa lok sabha up-chunaav unhone nirvirodh jitkar uttar pradesh main ek kirtiman sthpit kiya
 Before Dimple, Purushottam Das Tandon won the Allahabad Western Lok Sabha seat of Uttar Pradesh in 1952 as a male candidate unopposed

 It is also a criticism and praise that the work done by Akhilesh Yadav government in the last six months to improve law and order was not done in the last four years
 rajya kii raajnneeti main yah itihaas sa hi he ki koi party satta main hone ke baad sattavirohi lahar ke hone kii baat ko kahin se bhi nahin sweekaarti or vipaksh bhi is baat ko bhunaane kii purajor koshish nahin kar rahaa he

 mendosino county sheriff ke karyaalay kii ore se kaha gaya ki el nadi kii talachat kii gaad main unka vaahan funs gaya tha jisamen 41 vasheeya sandip thottapili or sanchi (9) fanse mili the
 By then he had died

 (from input language) supreme court main ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad main aaj sunwaayee hui
 During this time the Hindu Mahasabha presented his case before the top court
 maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi samvidhan peeth ne kaha ki yah vivaad do dharmon kii puja archana se judaa hua he
 Therefore, it should be initiated through a court-appointed arbitrator
 peeth ne kaha tha ki mukhya maamle kii sunwaayee 8 hafte ke baad hogi tab tak aapasi samjhaute se vivaad ko sulajhane kaa ek prayaas kiya ja saktaa he
 However, the apex court today reserved its decision regarding arbitration in this case
 madhyasthata ke sawaal par ramalala virajman or hindu mahasabha ne virodh jataayaa tha, jabaki muslim paksh or sunni vakf board ne kaha tha ki wo aapas main baatcheet karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Apart from Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, the matter is being heard by a bench of Justice SA Bobde, Justice Dhananjay y Chandrachud, Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice s Abdul Nazir
 aaie jaanate hai is masale par kis jaj ne kya kaha-1
 Advocate Harishankar Jain, on behalf of the Hindu Mahasabha, has opposed the arbitration
 unhone kaha ki agar court main partiyaan maan jaati hai, to aam janata is samjhaute ko nahin maanegi
 2
 is par justise ese bobade ne kaha he ki aap soch rahe hai ki kisi tarah kaa samjhauta karnaa padegaa koi haaregaa, koi jitegaa
 This does not happen every time in arbitration
 unhone kaha ki ye sirf jameen kaa masalaa nahin he balki bhaawanaaon kaa masalaa he, isliye ham chaahate hai ki baatcheet se hal nikle
 No one can make the place built or spoiled or the history as before
 isliye sthiti baatcheet se hi sudhar sakati he
 3
 justise bobade ne kaha ki babar ne jo kiya ham use thik nahin kar sakate hai, abhi jo halaat hai ham us par baat hi karenge
 If a case goes to arbitration, then the court has nothing to do with its decision
 yah sirf jameen kaa maamla nahin he, balki bhaawanaaon se judaa hua bhi he
 It is a matter of heart, mind and emotions
 isliye court chahta he ki aapasi baatcheet se iskaa hal nikle
 4
 justise bobade ne kaha ki koi us jagah bane or bigade nirmaan yaa mandir, masjid or itihaas ko UNDO nahin kar saktaa
 Whether Babar was or not, he was king or not is all a matter of history
 sirf aapasi baatcheet kii prakriya se sthiti UNDO ho sakati he
 5
 justise bobade ne kaha ki jo pehle hua hamaara koi niyantran nahin
 We are talking about what is in this dispute now
 ham desh kii body politics ke asar ko jaanate hai
 This heart is a matter of mind and healing
 justise bobade ne hindu mahasabha se kaha- aap kah rahe hai ki samjhauta fail ho jayega
 How can you pre judge? 6
 hindu mahasabha ne court main kaha ki is cese ko madhyasthata ke liye bheja jaae
 Prior notice is required
 yahi kaaran he ki hindu mahasabha iskaa virodh kar rahaa he
 He said that because this is our land
 isliye ham madhyasthata ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 On this, Justice Ashok Bhushan has said that if public notice is given in this case, the case will run for years, this arbitration will be under the supervision of the court
 7
 Justice Bobde stated that there should be no breach of confidentiality by the parties
 media main is par tippaniyan nahin honi chahie
 No reporting process
 agar isaki reporting ho to ise avmaananaa ghoshit kiya jaae
 8
 justise divai chandrachud singh ne kaha ki yah keval partiyon ke bich kaa vivaad nahin he, balki do samudaayon ko lekar vivaad he
 How will we bind millions through mediation? It will not be so easy
 ham pakshon ko pratinidhi ke taur par maanenge
 Mediation will be on consent basis
 9
 At the same time, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Ranjan Gogoi said that we want to give a decision in the case soon
 unhone maamle main pakshakaron se madhyasthon ko naam sujhane ko kaha he
 The apex court will consider later that the petitions filed on this issue be heard
 10
 The Hindu side said that if the agreement is reached on all the sides, how will the society accept it? Justice Bobde said that if the settlement is given to the court and the court agrees and passes the order
 tab vah sabhi ko maananaa hi hoga
 Justice Chandrachud said that the verdict of the court is a binding character
 madhyasthata main ham kaise logon ko badhyakaari bana sakate hai

 The state government sends Rs 42,000 every semester
 magar is baar chaatro ke khate main 1800 rupee hi aae hai
 Students say that they have no money for admission in the next semester
 agra ke emdi college ke chaatr ne apni pareshaani bheji he
 He says the same has happened with private and government college students

 They were removed on Teachers' Day itself
 kai baar log yah sochakar outsorcing vaali naukari tham lete hai ki sarkaar ke yahaan ek din permanent ho jayega
 They have to improve their political understanding of outsourcing and contract jobs
 nahin kar sakate to unhen ramanavami ke juluus main janaa chahie jisaki aajkal in 1832 computer shikshakon kii bhukhmaree se zyaada charchaa he
 By doing so, they will at least remain relevant to the politics of mania

 Time will be cut in that
 selary kii zarurat hi nahin padegi
 However, these teachers have also created a Twitter handle where they keep tagging the Chief Minister

 Your MP and MLA takes pension and asks you not to take pension
 yah chamatkaar isliye hota he kyonki aap raajnneetik rup se sajag nahin he
 After all, why is it that governments do not listen to anyone, then why do you put your life behind these two clams leaders

 a reader from Hansi has sent a clipping of Dainik Bhaskar
 khabar main likhaa gaya he ki government piji college prashasan ne progressive student union ke sadsy anwar ko barkhaast kar diya or ek anya sadsy anil ko chetavanee di he
 It is good that all the students have opposed this and together with Principal Savita Mann have warned of the movement
 bhaskar ne likhaa he ki college ke itihaas vibhaag ne 22 march ko bhagat singh, sukhdev or raajaguru kii shahadat ke maukey par bhaashan pratiyogita karai thi
 At the event, members of the Progressive Students' Front organized a book exhibition
 bhagat singh kii jail diary, dastauez va anya pragatisheel patrikaayen rakhi gayi
 Students said that the principal removed everything from the middle of the program

 After this, notice was put in which it is written to cut Anwar's name and warn Anil

 Earlier this arrangement was done in the news room of the media house

 When all this happened, the news room was buzzing with news
 ab in sabko hataa kar star ankar laayaa gaya he
 i request you aap kisi ankar ko star hone kaa ahsaas na karaaen

 Punya Prasun Vajpayee recently said that calls are received from the PMO to run and drop the news

 Compared to this system, you viewers have inadvertently developed a news room which i call a public news room
 bas ise trol or trend kii maansikta se bachaae rakhiegaa taaki khabaron ko jagah mili na ki ek hi khabar bheed ban jaae
 i have thought that from now on i will make a list of your information and put it on Facebook so that the guilt of not being able to do the news can be reduced
 yahaan se bhi lakhon logon ke bich pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 Come and see my routine sometime

 Soon you will not hear a final about such speeches

 Basic Teacher Training Course is a course in Uttar Pradesh
 praathmik vidhyalay main shikshak kii naukari paane ke liye yah course karnaa hota he
 The fee for a semester in private college is Rs 39,000
 rajya sarkaar har semester main 42,000 rupee bhejti he
 But this time only 1800 rupees have come to the students' account
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki agle semester main admician ke liye unke paas paise nahin hai
 The MD college student of Agra has sent his troubles
 unka kahana he ki privet or sarkari college ke chaatro ke saath bhi yahi hua he
 The student said that the name of Basic Teacher Training has been changed to Diploma in Elementary Education from the session 2018
 isamen rajyabar main 2 lakh chaatr honge
 Now when 2 lakh students cannot fight the injustice done to them, then what can i do alone
 inhone kaha he ki main kuch karun to main likhane ke alaava kya kar saktaa hum
 So i am writing here bihar se 1832 computer shikshak chaahate hai ki main unki baat uthaaun
 Take it away ye sabhi paanch saal se outsorcing ke aadhaar par skulon main padhaa rahe the
 At just Rs 8000
 ab inhen hataa diya gaya he
 Have been sitting on a dharna for eight months but no one is listening
 inhen shikshak diwas ke din hi hataa diya gaya
 Many times people take an outsourcing job thinking that one day the government will be permanent
 unhen outsorcing or kantrect kii naukari ko lekar apni raajnneetik samaj behatar kerani hogi
 If not, then they should go in the procession of Ram Navami, which is more discussed today than the hunger of these 1832 computer teachers
 aisa kar ve kam se kam unmaad aadhaarit raajnneeti ke liye praasangik bhi bane rahenge
 The need for jobs and salary will not be felt because the politics of mania is now permanent
 usamen time cat jayega
 There will be no need for salary
 vaise in shikshakon ne ek twitor handle bhi banaaya he jahaan ve mukhyamantri ko tag karte rahete hai
 But no one listens
 pachaas vidhayakon ne inke liye likhaa he magar kuch nahin hua
 This MP MLA is also of no use

 Look at the leaders' car and clothes
 ayyashi chal rahi he bhai logon kii
 Look at the tongue, speaking like goons
 aapkaa saansad or vidhayak pension letaa he or aap se kahata he ki pension mat lo
 This miracle happens because you are not politically conscious
 aakhir aisa kyon he ki sarkarein kisi kii nahin sunati to phir kyon in do kaudi ke netaaon ke peeche aap apana jivan laga dete hai

 bihar se 1832 computer shikshak chaahate hai ki main unki baat uthaaun
 Take it away ye sabhi paanch saal se outsorcing ke aadhaar par skulon main padhaa rahe the
 At just Rs 8000
 ab inhen hataa diya gaya he
 Have been sitting on a dharna for eight months but no one is listening
 inhen shikshak diwas ke din hi hataa diya gaya
 Many times people take an outsourcing job thinking that one day the government will be permanent
 unhen outsorcing or kantrect kii naukari ko lekar apni raajnneetik samaj behatar kerani hogi
 If not, then they should go in the procession of Ram Navami, which is more discussed today than the hunger of these 1832 computer teachers
 aisa kar ve kam se kam unmaad aadhaarit raajnneeti ke liye praasangik bhi bane rahenge
 The need for jobs and salary will not be felt because the politics of mania is now permanent
 usamen time cat jayega

 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa mek in india jald hi falak se isliye utar gaya kyonki nivesh rajyon main hona he or single windo clearence suubon kii sarkaron se milegaa, centre se nahin
 The biggest hope of industries, ie Goods and Services Tax (GST), hangs in the balance due to disagreement with the states
 aalu-pyaaj kii keemten kam hone ko raji nahin hai to vajah yah he ki rajyon ne mandi kanoon badalane main ruchi hi nahin lee
 If the cleanliness mission remains the ritual of central government departments then it is the responsibility of the states to give powers to local bodies
 modi ke sudhaar agenda main rajya sabase keemtee kadi hai or ab tak yah kadi majbootee se judi nahin he
 However, after the assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana, there is definitely a chance to add it
 in chunaavon ko lekar akalan agar sahi baithte hai to pashchim or uttar ke do pramukh audyogic rajyon main bijepi satta main yaa satta kii dhuree ke kareeb hogi
 For the first time after a long time, the ruling party or its allies at the Center will be taking power of all the major states of North and West and Central India, which are going to be engines of growth in the next decade
 iske baad ab modi ke liye tej sudhaaron ko taalane koi kaaran nahin bachaa he
 The changed scenario of center-state relations after the BJP government at the Center is the best combination for drastic economic reforms
 centre ke saath gujarat, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan, punjab or simandhra kii satta bijepi yaa uske sahyogi dalon ke paas he or maharashtra va haryana main party kii sambhaavnaaen ufaan par hai
 This is an occasion for which the UPA government yearned for ten years
 sudhaaron ke kai ahm prayog isi se paravaan nahin chadhe kyonki bade or sansaadhan sampann rajyon se centre ke rajnatik rishton main garmjoshi nahin thi
 Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat are among the four largest economies in the country
 punargathan ke baad andhra pradesh paanch sabase badi arthvyavastha se baahar ho gaya he
 West Bengal or Karnataka to be in the top five
 bhartiya rajyon ke is club five main gujarat bijepi ke paas he or maharashtra nishane par he
 Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are emerging states, where huge opportunities for investment and growth are being created
 dan and breadstreat kaa akalan he ki bharat ke 11 rajya (maharashtra, gujarat, tamilnadu, uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh, karnataka, rajasthan, kerala, bihar, orissa or sanyukït andhra) 2020 tak desh kii jidipi main 76 fisadi ke hissedaar honge
 At present, their share is 68 percent
 rojgaar, growth or mek in india ke sapanom ko jameen inhen 11 rajyon main milani he lekin pichley teen maah ke kaarykaal main modi ne rajyon se rishton ko nae sire se gande par koi kaam nahin kiya he isliye unke prayaason kaa prachaar hakeekat kii jameen main jad pakadta nahin dikhataa or anmane niveshak sudhaaron ke vaadon se mutmain nahin ho paa rahe hai
 When Modi announced his departure from the Planning Commission, the states agreed because with the abolition of the Planning Commission there was an end to the scheme raj which strangled the independence of states in taking development decisions
 modi mukhyamantri rahete hue skim raaj ko lekar centre kii dabangai ke khud bade virdohi the, isliye rajyon ko ummid thi ki unke aane ke baad centre ke saath vittiya rishte behatar honge or adhikaron kaa hastantaran badhegaa
 But Modi's government seems to be initiating the new scheme Raj, which is being loaded on the back of the old and arbitrary structure
 yah vyavastha pehle se zyada apaardarshee he
 There was a formula for the states in the planning commission era, the role of the states in the schemes of the NDA government is not fixed
 tex (jiesti), jameen (bhoomi adhigrahan) or bijli (koyala khadaanen or bijli kharid samjhaute) teen sabase buniyadi sudhaar hai, jinke liye sabhi rajyon ko sahamat karnaa jaruri he lekin pradhanmantri to ab tak apni party kii rajya sarkaron ko hi sudhaar ke samvaad se jod nahin paae hai
 This is the reason that despite Make in India, there is no major change in the atmosphere
 centre or rajya sarkarein chennai main nokia kii mobile phone factory band hone se baichaiyn nahin hai
 Delhi and Lucknow did not seem worried after the financial backbone of the sugar mills of western Uttar Pradesh
 khadaanon kaa aavanton talane se rajyon main nivesh thap he, bijligharon ke paas uplabdh koyale kaa str 25 saal main sabase kam he lekin centre or rajya ek saath prayaas karte nahin dikhte kyonki modi pichley teen maah main aarthik faislon main rajyon ke saath saajhedaari kaa koi channel nahin bana paae hai
 The same situation was in the previous government, so states had created separate models of investment and branding, Modi as the chief minister of Gujarat
 tej growth rajyon kii bhi rajnatik majaburi he or pichley kuch varshon main isaki koshish bhi hui he
 During 2012-13, the growth rate of 22 states in 26 was faster than the national GDP
 centre or rajyon kaa rajnatik nakshaa sudhaaron ke puri tarah mafik he, nai sarkaar ko sanghavaad kaa nayaa rasayan bananaa he
 Prime Minister Modi has come to Delhi demanding rights for the states
 alabatta dilli main baithkar unhen apane yani centre ke adhikaron main kami or rajyon ke rasookh main badhottaree kerani hogi
 Modi, who has broken the coalition and touched the pinnacle of politics, will have to form alliances for governance and growth, and while preparing a new design of decentralization of power, remember (andrew Carnegie's point) that if one does all the work himself and also takes credit for it If you want, then big changes become difficult

 maharashtra kii bijepi sarkaar ke mantriyon par ungali uthi he
 Due to the lack of disclosure of his property, it is being asked that why the Minister is not making the information public? This question has emerged from the application filed under the RTI Act
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ne apni arji main poocha tha ki kya maharashtra sarkaar ke mantriyo ne apni sampatti ko saarvajanik kiya he? is arji ke jawaab main mila jawaab bataata he kii rajya ke kisi bhi mantri ne abhi tak apni sampatti kii soochna nahin di he
 After this reply, Galgali has written to the Chief Minister's Office in a letter requesting that the minister should make public information about his assets soon
 anil galgali ne enditivi india se baat karte hue kaha ki, unke khat ko bheje hue 100 se adhik din ho chuke hai
 However, no response has been received yet
 ve yaad dilaanaa chaahate hai ki maujuuda centre sarkaar ne sabhi rajyon ko likhit main kaha he ki mantri apni sampatti se judi soochna saarvajanik karen
 The Maharashtra government has 20 BJP and 10 Shiv Sena ministers
 sarkaar kah rahi he ki sabhi ne bataur ummidavaar chunaav ayog ke paas apni sampatti kaa byora haal hi main diya he
 In such a situation, it is not mandatory to become public after becoming a minister
 rajya ke mukhiya devendra fadanvis ne enditivi india se baat karte hue kaha ki, supreme court ne 2008 main hi ek aadesh main kah diya he ki kisi mantri ko apni sampati kii soochna ko saarvajanik karne ke liye baadhya nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This information has been given to him by the Chief Secretary of the state
 mukhyamantri ne aage kaha ki, sampatti ko saarvajanik karne ke liye 31 agast tak kaa samay he
 In such a situation, we are deliberately not giving information, it is not appropriate to allege
 or bhale hi yah soochna dena anivaary nahin hoga
 We will still make the information public soon
 mantriyon kii sampati saarvajanik karne kaa maamla puraani sarkaar ke samay se chalaa aa rahaa he
 The important thing is that even before the congress-ncp government ministers did not provide their property online
 vaise, khud kii sampatti saarvajanik karne kii baat par desh ke kai rajyon kii mantri parishad main bhi ek raay nahin ban saki he

 You are in my thoughts and prayers tonight🙏— Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi) May 2, 2019 12: 01 AM Cyclone Phani may create havoc today Were found hanging from the tree adan kii khadi main ek pakistani yudhpot ke ''ek bhartiya yudhpot'' ko ragadate hue aage badhane kii 16 june kii vaardaat aisi koi pehali ghatana nahin thi jisamen pakistan ne gahare samudr main hamalavar harakat kii ho
 In the last few months, at least three invasive acts have been recorded, in which Pakistan acted to incite Indian war ships
 ek varisht raksha adhikari maanate hai, ''hamane paaya ki samudr main tanaav lagaataar bad rahaa he
 Officials say the June 16 incident came in the news only because it became the cause of a major diplomatic tension between the two countries
 darasal donon deshon ke yupoton main sampark bhi pehali baar hua tha
 In the latest incident, MV Suez, the Egyptian-owned merchant vessel rescued from the Somalian robbers, was being taken back to Pakistan by PNS Babar when INS Godavari reached there
 pakistani yudhpot bhartiya jahaaj kii taraf peeche kii taraf se badha, jisase faile hue helicopter ke net main maamuli-sa nuksaan hua
 Officials say that Pakistan, on the contrary, accused India of obstructing its rescue operations and proceeding by rubbing its warship Babur
 is aarope kaa videsh mantralay or bhartiya nausena, donon ne kadaa virodh kiya
 The Indian Navy even presented videos and photographs of this incident with Pakistan as evidence
 donon nausenaon ke liye yah lagbhag ek alikhit niyam he ki ve ek tayshuda duuri rakhkar ek duusare ke yupoton kaa peechha karti hai
 But in the last few months, Pakistani warships have been "very close" to Indian warships, so often that they have passed so close that the distance between the two used to be 80 feet
 iske baad pakistani chaalak dal ke sadsy ashleel fabtiyaan kasate hai or bhartiya nausainikon kii taraf apane hathiyaar laharaate hai
 In the flight world, the naval version of what is called "narrow escape" is the juggle that the Soviet Union used against NATO warships during the Cold War
 aise hatkande bharosa bahaali ke upayon (sibiem) kaa saraasar ulanghan karte hai, jin par donon deshon kii sarkaron ne 1992 main dastakhat kiye the or jisaki taid kii gai thi
 These confidence-building measures, designed by an Indian warship captain after firing on a Pakistani naval reconnaissance plane, stated that warships from both countries would have been at least three nautical miles away from each other
 in upayon main ''bajing'' yaa kisi vimaan ke bahut paas se nikalne kii manaahi he or chah se zyada yupoton vaale kisi nausainik abhyaas kii soochna ek duusare ko bhi dene kaa praavdhaan he
 These measures of confidence restoration seem to have been buried in history
 kuch saal pehle ghati ek ghatana main, ek pakistani yudhpot kaa helicopter bhartiya yudhpot ke helicopter deck par mandaraata rahaa jisaki vajah se ek bhartiya nausainik helicopter deck par utar nahin sakaa
 Another Pakistani naval ship came close to INS Virat in a manner provoking the aircraft carrier
 aisi ghatnaayen bhi hai jinamein pakistani chaalak dal bhartiya chaalak dal ke saamne nange ho gaye yaa fabtiyaan kasne lage
 Former Western Naval Commander Vice Admiral J
 es
 "such actions indicate being unprofessional," says Bedi
 '' ve kehete hai, ''apane kartavya ke prati patibaddh koi bhi nausena aisi harkaton ko bardaasht nahin kar sakati
 Naval officers say that senior Pakistani officials not only keep their eyes closed on such antics, but also promote them
 ek nausainik adhikari kehete hai, ''agar ienes godavari ke captain ne vahi kiya hota, jo babar ke captain ne kiya tha, to use court marshall kaa saamana karnaa padataa
 "we have a confusing situation," says a defense officer
 agar ham (unki harkaton kaa) jawaab dete hai, to khatra he tanaav badhane kaa
 And if we do not give up, then we face the danger of breaking the spirits of our crew
 '' sarkaar or bhartiya nausena donon ne aisi behad tanaavpurn halaaton main bahut saavdhaanee baratane kii salaah de rakhi he, kyonki ek to yudhpot apane taton se kaaphi dur kaam karte hai or duusare ve mixilon or topon se bade paimaane par las hote hai
 Defense officials say that one reason for Pakistani infamy is the increased confidence of its navy
 2001 ke baad se uske paas nae jahaaj aa gaye hai
 The warship built in China, PNS Zulfiqar, was the first "truly new" warship the Pakistani Navy had acquired, while the Pakistani Navy had previously operated with abandoned ships of the US and UK navies
 duniya kii duusari nausenaon ke saath kaam karke use visheshgyata or sammaan bhi hasil hua he
 The Pakistani Navy has commanded the Multinational Joint Task Force-151 (CTF-151) four times since 2009
 paanch nausenaon kaa yah kaarydal do saal pehle adan kii khadi or somali ghati ilaakon main samudri daakuon ke khilaaf karrwai ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 This resulted in a tendency to challenge the dominance of the Indian Navy
 bhartiya nausena sitief-151 main shaamil nahin he
 There is no such measure of confidence in the two navies, in which each other's warships normally talk at the port
 jahaan donon deshon kii thal senaaon main tanaav kam karne ke liye flag baithken hoti hai, bhartiya or pakistani nausena ke bich koi sampark nahin he
 Vice Admiral Suresh Bangar, former Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, says, "to avoid such incidents at sea, we need to do more than just confidence building measures
 dilli police ne ek mahila se dushkarm ke aarope main uttarakhand ke bhaajapa netaa or purv mantri harak singh ravat ke khilaaf praathmiki darj kar lee he

 haal hi main congress chhod bijepi main shaamil hue rawatis dauraan haalanki yah baat saaf ho gai ki baagi congress vidhayakon kaa netritv parde ke peeche se harak singh ravat kar rahe the
 After this awareness, Harak Singh joined the BJP

 He first became a minister in Kalyan Singh government in Uttar Pradesh in 1993
 vah 1996 main bahujan samaaj party (basapa) main shaamil ho gaye
 When Uttarakhand was partitioned from Uttar Pradesh in 2000, he joined the Congress
 vah narayan dutt tiwari, vijay bahuguna or harish ravat kii sarkaar main mantri rahe
 In the past, cases had also come up against Harak Singh Rawat
 In 2003, when he was a minister in the Narayan Dutt Tiwari government, a woman named Zaini gave birth to a child and said that its father is Harak Singh Rawat
 mahila ne aarope lagaaya tha ki kaam dilaane ke naam par uskaa yon shoshan kiya gaya
 Because of this, he had to leave the post of minister
 haalanki baad main yah maamla dab gaya
 Similarly, in 2014, a woman from Meerut had accused Harak Singh Rawat of physical abuse
 us vakt vah vijay bahuguna sarkaar main mantri the
 Later it was said that an alleged agreement was reached between the two and the matter was also suppressed

 Made a social decision like prohibition in Bihar
 pichhali sarkaar main vikaas ke jo kaary chal rahe the, unhen aage badhaane kaa kaam kiya
 It was difficult for me to work in the atmosphere that was created in the current situation
 hamane kabhi kisi se istipha nahin maanga
 He also spoke to Lalu ji on the allegations that were made, we also met Tejashwi
 hamane unase kaha ki jo bhi chal rahaa he us par spashtikaran den, janata ke saamne aakar safai den, lekin aisa bhi nahin kiya gaya
 Also talked to Rahul Gandhi - Nitish Kumar Kumar further said, "we have never compromised on our politics
 mere man main bahut dinon se ye baat chal rahi thi ki koi rasta nikal jaae
 We also spoke to Rahul ji, he had torn the ordinance
 bihar congress ke netaaon se bhi baat hui

 unki taraf se kaha gaya ki ye sankat he

 aarope par agar kuch spasht kar dete to hamen bhi koi aadhaar miltaa
 But even after so many days nothing was spoken on their behalf
 ''gathbandhan par aage nitish bole ''jitna ho saktaa tha, jab tak chalaa sakate the, hamane mahagathbandhan chalaaya

" raashtrapati chunaav main hamane ramnath kovind kaa samarthan kiya, wo bihar ke rajyapal rahe hai, uske baad hamaare upar jane kya-kya aarope lagaae gaye
 The scope of our thinking is also different
 isliye maine apni antaratma kii aawaaj suni or apana tyaagptr de diya
 We do not want to dispute, but when there was no way out, we had to do so

 After the bjp's attack on the solidarity of the opposition seen in Kolkata last week, the ally Shiv Sena and the opposition Congress said on Monday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was nervous before seeing the Lok Sabha elections and that "fear" was contained
 vahiin, vitt mantri arun jetali or grih mantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki yah sirf modi kii lokapriyata kaa dar or bhaajapa kii safaltaaen hai jisane kai alag - alag takaton ko pradhanmantri ke khilaaf ek saath kar diya
 Jaitley said that any sort of opposition mobilization would be impractical and short lasting alliance
 unhone yah bhi poocha, ‘‘kya yah modi banaam avyavashtha hogi ? '' jetali ne ek fasebuk post main kaha ki isse (vipaksh ke ekajute hone se) aam chunaavon main bhaajapa ko phayda hone ja rahaa he kyonki ek aakankshapurna samaaj alp avadhi ke raajnneetik gathbandhan ko vot dekar ‘‘samuhik aatmahatya'' nahin karegaa
 Agreeing with the views of the Finance Minister, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that it is the fear of bjp's successes that has brought the opposition parties together
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa singh ne greater noida main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘ve (mahagathbandhan) is baat ko lekar bhaybheet hai ki bhaajapa phir se sarkaar banaaegi
 Its ally Shiv Sena, which is angry with the BJP, said that recently Prime Minister Narendra Modi (while visiting l & T's weapon manufacturing center in Gujarat) made a speech by climbing a tank
 party ne hairaangi jataate hue poocha, ‘‘ to phir 22 vipakshi dalon ke ekajute hone se unhen kanpakanpi kyon chhot rahi he
 On Sunday, Prime Minister Modi rejected the grand alliance of opposition parties, alleging that it was a "coalition of corruption, negativity and instability and was created by those who are afraid of the fight against corruption
" jetali kii tippanee par pratikriya jaahir karte hue trinmul congress ne kaha he ki mukhyamantri (pashchim bengal) mamata banerjee dwaara pichley shanivaar ko bulaai gai kolkata raily ne centre kii bhaajapa nit sarkaar kii buniyaad hilaa kar rakh di he
 Trinamool Congress General Secretary Partha Chatterjee said in Kolkata, "for the last two days (saturday), whether it is the Prime Minister or other Union Ministers, everybody is talking about this rally
" haalanki, mamata banerjee centre kii sarkaar main nahin hai phir bhi unhen lagata he ki vah isamen hai
 This is the reason why Jaitley ji is making such remarks even after being ill
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘bhaajapa ko abhas ho gaya he ki uske ginati ke din hi shesh rah gaye hai
 
 
 The rally seems to have shaken the foundation of the Modi government
 '' trinmul congress pramukh mamata banerjee dwaara kolkata main shanivaar ko yojit raily main vipaksh kii ekajutata kaa zikr karte hue shivesna ne apane mukhpatr ‘saamana'' ke ek sampadakeey main kaha he ki ‘modi is bhram main nahin rahen ki unki sarkaar amar he
 The Shiv Sena has said that the Trinamool Congress chief is directly challenging the modi-shah duo
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘‘mamata sahit raily main shirkat karne vaale adhiktar netaa ek samay main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali sarkaar main bhaajapa ke sahyogi rah chuke hai or un logon kaa majaak udaane kii jarurat nahin he
 Modi's government is not the enemy of the country, but he should not be under the illusion that his government is immortal
 '' baharhaal, centre or maharashtra main bhaajapa kii sahyogi dal shivasena ne satta main maujuud party (bhaajapa) kii aalochana karne ke apane adhikaar kaa bachaav kiya
 Mamta had invited Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to come to the rally but the party said that our Ranbheri we keep blowing from our own ground and that is the first thing we have blown
 shivasena ne kaha, ‘‘ ‘mamata banerjee ke manch par upasthit saare netaa dharmanirpekshatavaadi the
 Shiv Sena is not pseudo-secular
 hamaari vichaardhaara ‘hindutv' he or ram mandir tathaa samaan naagarik samhita ke mudde par hamaara ruukh drudh he
 Shiv Sena's attitude in Kolkata rally is not digestible
 '' vahiin, congress ke varisht netaa ahamed patel ne kaha he ki vipaksh ke mahagathbandhan ke bare main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii haalia tippanee or unke haav - bhav se yah sabit ho gaya he ki vah uski (vipaksh kii) ekajutata se dare hue hai
 Patel told reporters in Ahmedabad, "as you have noticed, the Prime Minister is now talking about the Grand Alliance in his speeches
" isse jaahir hota he ki unke man main kisi tarah kii dar kii bhaavana samaa gai he
 Even his gesture proves that he is now afraid of opposition solidarity
 '' In the midst of a debate on whether to make Narendra Modi the prime ministerial candidate, Mahmood Madani, the general secretary of the major Muslim organization Jamiat ulema-e-hind, said that there was a change in the attitude of Muslims regarding the Chief Minister of Gujarat, but later Madani clarified Giving that he said only in the context of Gujarat
 ‘aaj tak’ ke saptahik kaarykram ‘sidhi baat’ main jab madani se poocha gaya ki modi ko lekar musalamaanon ke rukh main badlaav aayaa he?, to unhone kaha, ‘gujarat chunaav main modi ko musalamaanon ke ek varg ke vot mili hai
 Things have changed, the times have changed, however, there is something that they have got votes
 ’unhone congress kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha, ‘gujarat main logon ke saamne do ‘meharbaan the’
 Those 'kind' are also like this, so people have chosen this kind
 koi doodh kaa dhulaa nahin he
 Meanwhile, Mahmud Madni clarified, 'my statement is being moved out of context
 maine sirf gujarat ko lekar yah baat kahi he
 There is no change in the attitude of Muslims at the national level
 yah kabhi nahin ho saktaa

 The famous Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the only book whose birth anniversary is celebrated in the whole world
 bhagwaan shrikrishna ne kurukshetra main pavitra gita kaa divya sandesh yun to arjuna ko diya tha
 But in reality he was just a medium
 shrikrishna uske madhyam se sampurna maanav jati ko sachet karnaa chaahate the
 The Gita is the best means to rescue every human from all kinds of crises

 This mantra is absolutely capable of establishing peace in the world
 haryana ke kurukshetra main jyotisar hi vah bhoomi he jiske liye gita ke pehle hi shloke main ‘dharm kshetre kurukshetre’ shabd prayog kiye gaye
 What could be more important than this
 yah sahi he ki kurukshetra assi kos vishaal maidan kaa naam rahaa he, jahaan mahabharat yuddh ke liye attharah akshuhinee sena utari thi
 The war of Mahabharata took place more than five thousand years ago, which lasted for eighteen days

 Arjuna asks him to put his chariot in the middle of both the armies
 jab rath par baithe arjuna ne saamne shastryukt senaniyon par nigaah daali to apane pitamah, guru or duusare swajanon ko dekhte hi uske praan sookhne lage
 At that time, Arjun told Sri Krishna that he did not have the desire of the state by killing his kinsmen
 main yuddh nahin karnaa chahta
 Shri Krishna understood that Arjuna is being seduced
 arjuna ne shrikrishna se anekanek prashn kiye, jinke uttar dekar shrikrishna ne use niraashaa se ubaara or vah phir se ladane ko taiyaar ho gaya
 'geeta' is the name of turning despair into hope
 hajaaron varshon kii lambii avadhi ke dauraan kurukshetra ko samay-samay par bahari akramanakariyon ne nasht-bhrasht kiya
 Where the message of Gita was given, it is not mentioned anywhere, but it is an established truth that this message was given in Kurukshetra itself
 hamaare kai tirth pratikatmak sthiti main hai
 Gita-sthal also comes in such a category

 Team India, captained by Virat Kohli, will descend on the Green Field International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram today with a win against New Zealand in the third and decisive T20 match
 viraat kohli kii aguai vaali team india kaaphi acchhee form main chal rahi he lekin newjiland ne pehle vanade or phir tii-20 siries main use kadi takkar di 
 The series is on par with 1-1 and it is feared that like the india-australia T20 series that preceded it, the decisive match of this series may also get rain because the Meteorological Department has predicted rain
 
 29 saal baad tiruvanantpuram main machatiruvanantpuram main lagbhag 29 saal baad international match kaa aayojan ho rahaa he
 Earlier in 1988, Vivian Richards, West Indies played against India at the University Stadium here on 25 January
 aise main mangalvaar ko khele jane vaale is tii-20 match ke liye baari sankhya main darshak stadium pahunch sakate hai
 At what number will Dhoni play? All eyes will be on Mahendra Singh Dhoni's batting order in the third T20 match
 dhoni ko cricket ke sabase chote praaroop main badalane kii maang ek baar phir tej ho gai he
 Former veteran cricketer VVS Laxman has said that Dhoni may be a part of the ODI team, but the time has come for someone else to flourish in the shortest format
 dhoni ne duusare tii-20 match main 37 gend main 132 ke strike rate se 49 ran kii pari kheli thi jo bura pradarshan nahin he lekin pichley ek saal main unka strike rotate karne main naakaam rahanaa chintaa kii baat he
 Dhoni scored 26 runs from the five-ball boundary which included three sixes and two fours but he could only score 23 runs in the remaining 32 balls
 ab yah dekhnaa rochak hoga ki captain kohli or mukhya coach ravi shastri agle match main dhoni ko koun se kram par khilaate hai
 Some people suggest that Dhoni is better at number four if India loses early wickets as it gives him time to freeze
 team indiatim india ne pehle tii-20 main newjiland ko 53 ran se haraaya tha lekin duusare match main team ko 40 ran se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa jahaan colin munro ne mejabaan team ke gendbaaji akraman ko dhwast karte hue shatak jadaa
 In batting, Kohli scored 65 off 42 balls but was disappointed by the rest of the batsmen
 fielders bhi ummid ke mutabik pradarshan nahin kar paae
 To win the series, India will have to do well in batting and bowling
 dilli ke firozshah kotla maidan par khele gaye pehle tii-20 match main bharat ne jeet hasil kii thi, lekin rajkot main khele gaye duusare match main newjiland ne acchhee vaapasi karte hue siries 1-1 se baraabar kar di
 In the middle order, Shreyas Iyer, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Hardik Pandya will have to do well
 nae ballebaaj shreyas ayyar ne 23 ran kii pari ke dauraan kuch achche shot khele lekin phir kharaab shot khelkar pavilion laute
 Hardik Pandya has failed in the last few matches, but the captain has defended him and he would like to do well in tomorrow's match
 pichley match main bhartiya team ke gendbaajon ko bhi pich par sangharsh karte dekha gaya tha
 Apart from Jasprit Bumrah, none of the bowlers of the Indian team bowled well on the pitch
 bhartiya team ke spin gendbaaj bhi team ko jeet dilaane main naakaam rahe
 However, this time the pitch and conditions of Thiruvananthapuram Stadium can bring positive results for Indian players
 is match ke dauraan agar kisi kaaran dakworth louis niyam kaa istemaal karnaa pad jaataa he, to captain viraat kohli ko iske liye bhi yojana banaakar taiyaar rakhni hogi
 Talking about the New Zealand team, it has performed well but not regularly
 siries ke pehle match main mehmaan team kaa pradarshan har kshetra main kharaab tha, lekin duusare match main newjiland ne behtareen vaapasi karte hue apni kshamta kaa pradarshan kiya
 The New Zealand batsmen have faced the Indian bowlers well, while their spinners and fast bowler Trent Boult have performed effectively against the Indian batsmen
 bolt ne rajkot main ek hi over main opening ballebaajon shikhar dhawan or rohit sharma ko pavilion bhejkar bhartiya top order kii qamar tod di
 In such a situation, if New Zealand has to take the series, then it will have to maintain the performance of the previous match in this match as well
 donon timen:team india:viraat kohli (captain), shikhar dhawan, rohit sharma, lokesh rahul, manish pandey, shreyas ayyar, dinesh karthik, mahendra singh dhoni (wicketiper), hardik pandya, akshar patel, yujavendra chahal, kuldeep yadav, bhubaneshwar kumaar, jasprit bumraah or mohammad siraaj
 New Zealand: Kane Williamson (captain), Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor, Trent Boult, Tom Bruce, Colin de Grandholm, Martin Guptill, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls, Adam Milne, Colin Munro and Glenn Phillips (wicket keeper)

 ek sansanikhej video footage saamne ai he, jisamen vidrohi camere par syria ke raashtrapati bashar al-asad ke sainikon kaa katle-aam karte hue dikh rahe hai
 The video shows the rebels nabbing 7 of Assad's soldiers and hitting them on the ground, and then stands with a gun pointed towards them
 kuch sainikon kii peeth or kandhon par chot ke gambhir nishaan bhi the
 Just before killing the soldiers, ring-leader Abdul Samad Issa aka 'chacha' reads a poem and then shoots the first shot at them
 vah kahata he, '40 saalon se ye bhrashtachar ke saathi bane hue hai
 We swear by the above, it is our promise that we will take revenge
 'april 2012 main is bhayaavah vaake kaa video banaaya gaya tha, jise kuch din pehle ek purv vidrohi apane saath lekar syria se bhaag gaya tha
 The rebel says that he was frightened by the cruel tricks of his comrades, so ran away
 usne yah footage angreji akhbaar neuyork times ko saunpa he
 Issa is called 'uncle' because her two assistants are her nephews
 vah chahta tha ki katl-e-aam kaa video banaaya jaae taaki ve donneton dene vaale logon ko ise dikhaakar zyada se zyada fund ikattha kar sake
 At the end of the footage the corpses of the soldiers are thrown into a well, while a gunman rebel smiles while looking at the camera
 is footage se america kii musiibat bad sakati he, jo tathakthith rup se nagarikon ke khilaaf rasinic hathiyaron kaa istemaal karne vaali syrian sena ke khilaaf yuddh ke bare main soch rahaa he
 Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry said the inaction in Syria would strengthen the extremist group, with steps being taken to speed up the voting process in the US parliament on a proposal to approve military action against the Assad government
 kerri ne kaha, 'main aapse daawey ke saath kah saktaa hum ki agar aaj hamane apana munh mode liya to media main ham jo maare gaye logon kii tasviir dekh rahe hai, ve or bhi zyada dikhengi, kyonki charampanthi iske prati akshirt honge or asad se mukaable ke liye ekmaatr vikalp hone kii vajah se ve vitt poshit bhi kiye jaaenge
 Carey said that if the US does not take any action today, the American people will get to see many more videos similar to the ones aired in 'the New York Times'
 kerri ne saath hi kaha, 'hakeekat main meraa maananaa he ki rasinic hathiyaaron ke upyog ke viraddh america karrwai se in video main maujuud un logon ko nuksaan hoga, kyonki vastav main yah udaar vipaksh ko shashakt banayega
 The Foreign Minister said that there are more than a dozen 'very bad' jihadis who have been attracted to the chaos that has spread in Syria

 Congress's star campaigner Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said today that she will not campaign in favor of the party candidate in Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency of bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 priyanka ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se sankshipt baatcheet main is sawaal par ki kya vah varanasi prachaar karne ja rahi hai, unhone kaha, main varanasi nahin jaaoongi

 At the same time, Priyanka compared her brother party vice-president Rahul Gandhi to his father former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and said that the way his father was criticized for introducing computers in the country, in the same way he started new thinking schemes
 Rahul's evil is being done
 priyanka ne rahul kii ummidavaari vaale kshetra amethi main yojit jansabha main kaha ki rajeev gandhi ne desh ke liye jo kiya vah unke guzar jane ke baad bhi logon ko phayda pahunchaa rahaa he

 bharat main jab computer laae gaye to khub aalochana kii gai ,lekin aaj jo kranti he vah unki hi nitiyon kii vajah se hui
 Similarly, Rahul has far-sighted thinking and he is also criticized
 priyanka ne kaha, jaise rajeev ji ne hindustan aironaticks limited, indo gulf fertiligers, indira gandhi rashtriya uddyan academy banaayi, usee tarah rahul ne amethi main indira gandhi rashtriya udaan academy ko karporate terminal ke rup main viksit kiya

 abhi or badhenge maamlevisheshgyon ne rajdhani dilli main machharon se hone vaali bimariyon jaise malaria, dengue or chikungunia ke maamle badhane kii ashanka jataai he
 According to experts, these days humidity has increased in Delhi and chances of rain are also increasing, so if it rains in Delhi, suitable environment will be found for mosquitoes and after the rain, larvae will grow rapidly due to the water stored in the pits

 On September 10, three days before Narendra Modi was declared bjp's prime ministerial candidate for the General Election 2014, members of the party's minority cell sailed in 14 boats to Nal Sarovar, a scenic bird sanctuary 60 km from Ahmedabad
 unhone narendra modi kii raah kii sabase badi kamajori— gujarat 2002—ke bachaav kii ranneeti banane ke liye is maahaul ko chunaa
 He was not at all worried about how this most popular leader of the country would win this weakness
 desh ke sabase khooni sampradayik dangon main se ek kii raakh se uthakar bhartiya raajnneeti ke centre tak pahunchane kii unki gaatha sabase buree sthiti se sabase zyada laabh uthaane kii romaanchak kahani he
 Modi, who changed the discourse of Indian politics, now refrains from using the word 'hindu' or 'muslim'
 ve samooche bharat kii baat karte hai
 He has been doing this since he started his campaign a decade ago
 phir bhi sarovar ke kinare baithe unke shubhachintak apane yoddha kii himaayat karne ke tark tay karne ko betaab the
 Modi is constantly talking about India from the fixed forums, but so far he has not been able to create any slogan of change
 ve netaaon kaa asli cheharaa dikhaate hai or vaade karte hai
 They still break the head of the trinity of mother-son (sonia gandhi-rahul Gandhi) and puppet (prime Minister Manmohan Singh) for the country's problems
 ve congress-mukt gujarat kaa prayog samooche bharat main apnaane kaa vaada karte hai
 The Congress has not been able to break this man who has come a long way in power alone
 haalanki congress modi ke nae-nae naaron kaa jawaab dene kii taiyaari main jarur lagi he
 Modi has time because the general election is still seven months away
 lekin isi saal november main hone vaale paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav desh ke mizaaj kii jhalak dikhalaa denge
 Modi too understands this well and cannot afford to sit relaxed
 unhen jarurat he aise chunavi mudde kii jo janata main lahar paidaa kar sake
 He won the first battle on the same day when the party was forced to declare him the prime ministerial candidate
 apane kaam, soch or mahatvakanksha kii takat ke bal par unhone party ke liye ise aprihaary kar diya
 For ten years he had been pushing alone from Gandhinagar
 haalanki unki party main pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaaron kii puri jamaat he lekin ayodhya andolan ke daur ke laalkrishna adwani ke baad bijepi main kisi netaa ko itnaa jabardast samarthan nahin mila
 Due to the failures of the Manmohan Singh government, the group of disheartened people seems to be joining hands with Modi, who is a good talker
 inamen companiyon ke bordroom se lekar madhyamvargeey gharon ke log shaamil hai
 But now the challenge for Prime Ministerial candidate Modi is to turn the personal victory of 13 September into a historic moment in 2014
 yah chunauti na sirf jamini str par he, balki bhaavnaatmak str par bhi he
 Like the Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he will have to conquer the mental plane of the country, following the bumpy paths of politics
 iske liye pehali ranneeti media ke josh ko hawa dene or sound bits banaate rahane kaa he
 The second strategy is to present himself in a new form, for which Modi is trying hard
 pradhanmantri pad ke is ummidavaar ne ab naram bhashaa main bolnaa shuru kar diya he
 Modi's Mission India is a political project whose examples are rarely seen in the country
 bharat ek vidhitapurna nirvachan kshetra aaj modi kii koi bhi aam raily ek focus group kii tarah hoti he, jahaan brands modi kasuti par rahata he
 They will also hold small informal meetings with first-time voting students and select groups of youth, women, IT experts, businessmen and Muslims
 ve muslim virdohi or dharmanirpeksh virdohi thappa hataane ke liye uttar pradesh, bihar or andhra pradesh ke madrason main bhi jane vaale hai
 "modi ji is very keen to go to at least two-three madrasas and talk to the youth there," says a BJP leader associated with the campaign
 unhen musalamaanon ke dar ko hawa dene vaale shaitan insaan rup main prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he
 But they want to tell Muslims the Gujarat model of development without appeasement
 ”prachaar ke naare abhi tay nahin hue hai, lekin sara daaromadar 'ummid’ or 'congress-mukt bharat’ par rahegaa
 By the way, Modi's first priority is five states with assembly elections - Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram
 matdaan paanch charnon main hone kii sambhaavna he isliye party ke sadhano ko ranneeti ke hisaab maidan main utaara jayega
 Modi also wants to focus on the states that send the most members to the Lok Sabha
 inamen uttar pradesh, maharashtra, bihar or andhra pradesh shaamil hai
 By handing over the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh to his loyalist Amit Shah, Modi has made it clear that this state with 80 Lok Sabha seats will play an important role in helping BJP reach the target of more than 272 seats
 prachaar yojana se kareeb se jude ek varisht party netaa kaa kahana he, ''modi ne saaf sandesh diya he ki apane dam par bahumat paane ke liye ji-jaan ladaani he
 The message of more than 272 seats from top to bottom is being filled in every member's mind
 ” deshbhar main har gaanv kii deevaaron par ummid or badlaav kaa sandesh— 'nai soch, nai ummid’ modi ke photo ke saath hoga
 Modi wants to focus on elected groups rather than rallies
 modi kaa maananaa he ki chote-chote samoohon se aamane-saamne sampark behatar he or kaaryakarta ghar-ghar jaakar prachaar karen
 Modi might not be able to hold big rallies in more than 100 constituencies
 in reliyon ke liye bhi khaas shrota chune jaaenge or naare bhi lakshith honge
 For example, the slogan of ex-servicemen rally in Rewari, Haryana on 15 September was - 'one Rank - One Pension', then the Hunkar rally to be held on October 27 in Patna will try to capitalize on the aspirations of the youth
 tushtikaran ke bina vikaas kaa agendamodi acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki dharmanirpekshata ke naam par virdohi unhen baantne vaala netaa bataaenge
 But they are determined to break their anti-muslim image
 ab unhen sabko jodgaye vaala netaa dikhaane kii puri koshish ho rahi he
 There is a clear message for the minority cell in every state: First make the Muslims a member of the BJP, then send them to mobilize community support for Modi for the post of Prime Minister
 modi kii team musalamaanon ko lubhaane ke liye prachaar saamagree or vijan dastavej taiyaar kar rahi he
 He has asked the team to see that Muslims should be seen in large numbers at every rally
 17 sitambar ko jaipur kii raily main musalamaanon se topi or burke main aane ko kaha gaya tha
 The same instructions have been given for the Bhopal rally on 25 September
 team modi ko lagata he ki kattar modi virdohi or roodhiwaadee devbandi musalamaanon ke ek hisse main shuru hui bahes modi ke paksh main jaaegi
 a small section of these Muslims believe that Modi is expected to become the Prime Minister, so do not be hostile to him, because Modi has come a long way since 2002 and he takes a development agenda without discrimination against minorities
 Are going on mujffarnagar dangon par modi kii chuppi isi ore ishaara he
 Their motive is to appeal to the common Muslims through intermediaries and make them believe that appeasement of minorities is the root of communal riots
 is tarah ve ugr musalamaanon ko alag-thalag karnaa chaahate hai
 The September 16 statement of Jamiat ulema-e-hind leader Mahmood Madni indicated that if Modi honestly extended his hand to Muslims, he might even think of changing his perspective

 The National Hindu Army has threatened to kill the Assistant Professor of Nejwahar Lal Nehru University
 sena ne professor ko guwahati main hone vaali ol india oriental conference main shaamil naa hone kii dhamkee di he
 Professor Rizwanur Rahman, a faculty member of the Center for Arabic and African Studies, said, 'I received a letter on December 22 from the Hindu Rashtra Sena threatening to attend the All India Oriental Conference
 'yah conference sanskrit ayog, kendriya sanskrit board or rashtriya sanskrit santhaan banaae jane ke silsile menyojitahone vaali he
 According to sources, the threat has been sent to all the scholars of Arabic, Persian and Islamic Studies departments, who are planning to attend the conference
 aakhirkaar adwani maan gaye
 Had to agree
 koi ruuthata bhi isiilie he, taaki use manaaya jaae or tabhi vah maane
 This process of persuasion will continue even further, but this time the pieces used by Advani have started showing a glimpse of the possible internal threats of the BJP for the coming days
 modi ke netritv ko party ke bheetar se mil sakane vaali sambhavit chunautiyaan
 Advani's desire to go to the Bhopal seat near Vidisha says a lot
 vidisha se sushamaa swaraj party kii pratyaashee hai
 His thirty-six figure is well known to Narendra Modi
 gathbandhanon ko lekar sushamaa apni naaraazgi twitor ke madhyam se saarvajanik kar chuki hai
 She repeatedly discussed Advani's leadership before Modi's candidature was announced
 gujarat or madhya pradesh kii milti simaaen, vidisha-bhopal kii nazdikiyaan or adwani-sushamaa kii karibiyaan
 
 
 Anant Kumar of Karnataka, who is said to be standing close to sushma-advani, who is said to be the permanent in-charge of Madhya Pradesh, and among them all is Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 adwani unhen modi ke baraabar khadaa karne kii lagaataar koshish karte rahe hai
 First an attempt to show that Modi is a BJP Chief Minister like Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Raman Singh
 modi sansadeey board main aane lage, to adwani ne jid pakad lee ki chouhan ko bhi laayaa jaae, taaki modi kii tulana chouhan se hi hoti rahe or pradhanmantri kii daavedaari ke liye modi kaa naam na aae
 But the RSS turned away all these plans
 madhya pradesh main shandaar jeet dilaane ke baad chouhan kaa kad party main ooncha hua he
 He naturally becomes a contender for a big responsibility in the party, but Ho has been different
 chouhan ke kandhe par rakh kar bandook chalaai ja rahi he
 Efforts are being made to make Madhya Pradesh a stronghold of anti-modi
 aisa sandesh diya ja rahaa he ki bijepi main modi kaa virodh karne waalon ko sirf madhya pradesh main hi sharan mil sakati he
 That is, efforts are being made to make Madhya Pradesh an island of opposition to Modi in the sea of BJP
 jo shivaraj singh chouhan loksabhaa chunaav main sabhi 29 siten jeetne kii baat kehete hai, unke bare main yah prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he ki ummidavaaron kaa chayan jaanboojhkar is tarah se kiya gaya ki party 15-16 se zyada siten na jeet sake
 Apparently, Shivraj Singh Chauhan is being harmed by this
 party ke bheetar unhen modi ke saamne khadaa karne kii koshishen aage chal kar unhen nuksaan pahunchaa sakati hai
 Although Chauhan himself understands these things
 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan vah baar-baar kehete rahe ki vah pradhanmantri pad kii daud main nahin hai or modi ko pradhanmantri banane ke liye kaam karenge
 Tired of these questions, he has not given any interview since December
 unke kareebi yah kehete hai ki jab adwani kii ore se hi yah sandesh aae ki vah bhopal se ladanaa chaahate hai, to phir aise main vah kaise manaa kar sakate the
 His close ones ask if there is a BJP Chief Minister who does not listen to Advani's request? iske baavjood sandesh yahi ja rahaa he ki chouhan modi virodhiyon ke ishaaron par khel rahe hai
 Personally, Chauhan's ambitions are not going down
 vah jaanate hai ki umr unke saath he
 The challenge before him is to show better work in Madhya Pradesh for the next five years, so that in the coming time, he can present a better claim to take charge of the party after Modi
 sangh ke str par yah baat maani gai he ki shivaraj main netritv kii behatar sambhaavnaaen hai
 In the organization, he can naturally emerge as number two after Modi
 shivaraj ko kuch sabak bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se bhi seekhney honge
 Nitish Kumar also came under the influence of leaders opposing Modi in BJP
 unhen laga ki unhen saath lekar vah modi ko roak sakenge, lekin hua iskaa ulta
 anti-modi has been marginalized in the BJP, Nitish Kumar is seen getting into trouble after he split from BJP in Bihar
 tamaam janamat surveykshanon main sambhaavna vyakt kii ja rahi he ki nitish kumaar kii party loksabhaa chunaav main bihar main tisare number par rahegi, jabaki bijepi pehle
 If this happens, then after the Lok Sabha elections, there can be a crisis on his government
 kshetreey kshatrapon ke ubhaar ke is yug main in kshatrapon ko apni mahatvakankshaon ko apane rajyon kii janata kii aakankshaon ke saamne nahin laana chahie
 The conflict in these is not in the interest of the state
 yah aisa daur he, jab rajya main apni pakad majboot karne ke liye kuch kshatrap vipareet vichaardhaara ke centre se haath milaane main bhi sankoch nahin karte
 An example is the National Conference in Jammu and Kashmir, which was included in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet
 phir yahaan to 'parivaar' kii hi baat he
 Queen Elizabeth II was the chief guest on the Republic Day Parade in 1961
 lord mountbeton ne is baat ke liye nehru ko manaa liya tha ki maharani or raashtrapati rajendra prasad sanyukt rup se salaami lenge

 It was Pandit Nehru's mistake that he invited Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India, to become the first Governor General of the country
 jinna apekshaakrit zyada yathartwaadee the
 When Mountbatten suggested that Pakistan should also become the Governor General, Jinnah flatly refused
 mountbeton ne dephence cameti ke ek chairman ko namankit kiya, jisane niti-nirmaan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai, ek aisi bhoomika jo unhen nahin di jaani chahie thi
 Pandit Nehru did not personally object to it and these matters, which should have been discussed in the Indian Cabinet, were not raised
 is prakaar dephence cameti ne pradhanmantri kii puri jaankaree main bhartiya cabinet kii bhoomika nibhaai
 Despite Mountbatten being the nominal constitutional head of government, he advised Pandit Nehru to raise the issue of Kashmir in the United Nations
 ve to vilay patr par kashmir ke maharaja ke dastakhat karne se pehle srinagar main sena bhejne ke bhi khilaaf the
 Pandit Nehru and (sardar Vallabhbhai) Patel, disregarding his advice, decided to send the Indian Army to Srinagar immediately by plane
 bhartiya sena vakt rahete vahaan pahunch gai or srinagar ko pakistani hamalaavaron ke haathon main jane se bachaa liya gaya
 When the draft of the application to be sent by India to the UN Security Council was prepared, Mountbatten advised that the draft should be shown to Pakistan Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan
 yah itnaa hairaan kar dene vaala prastaav tha ki pandit nehru ne bhi unki baat maanane se inkaar kar diya
 Sardar Patel was not in favor of Kashmir being referred to the United Nations, which he called 'dis-united Nations'
 pandit nehru ne samajhadaari dikhaate hue vah masauda gandhi ji ko dikhaaya, jinhone, ‘swatantra darja’ tathaa shabdon ko pencil se katkar mahatvapurn sanshodhan kiya
 In October 1954, the Prime Minister visited China and was received by millions of people standing on both sides of the road when Pandit Nehru and Chinese Prime Minister Chow En-lai got out in Beijing
 pandit nehru ko sachmuch laga ki yah swatarusfoort or aam janata kaa prem bharaa swaagat tha
 Whereas the reality was that it was completely organized

 Because what is happening in Kashmir, whether soldiers are being killed or terrorists, they are the children of our country and Kashmir

In most of China's recent diplomatic history, "informal summits" have been contradictions

 There is no conversation here, written and tied-up
 magar hindustan kaa sabaka ab puraane china se nahin he
 In October last year, Shijinping was crowned a lifetime president with success and before that his name was written in the party's constitution
 march main ise raashtrapati ke kaarykaal kii seemaa ko khatm karke aupchaarik swaroop de diya gaya
 In this way, Xi began his second term with an undeniable position
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or shi ke bich vuhaan shikhar sammelan bhi is baat kaa sabase saaf sanket he ki kis tarah chini raashtrapati china kii videsh niti kaa mukammal or gairmamuli taur par nijee dhang se jimmaa sambhaal rahe hai or ateet ke protocol yaa shishtacharon ko tahas-nahas kar rahe hai
 In doing so, Xi is undoubtedly taking full responsibility and responsibility for China's foreign relations — that is, reward and risk — on his shoulders
 yah vah jimmedaari he jo pehle raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or paulitte beuro kii sthaayee samiti milakar sambhalati thi
 (xi's predecessor Hu Jintao was a strict observer of the protocol and rarely ever directly interacted with Indian Prime Ministers
 yah kaam unhone apane pradhanmantri ke liye chhod diya tha
 ) Says Yanmei Xi, senior analyst of China policy at Beijing's Gwekel Research, "we are seeing a situation in which the rise and fall of the nation, nation, state and party have joined with Xi
 '' yah badlaav kaa keval ek hissaa he
 More importantly, Beijing appears to be more and more ready to play a much larger role in forging global institutions, moving forward in international disputes and acting as a mediator and bringing China's authoritarian capitalist model of solution to the world
 Is pushing beijing ke jaankaar or kootneetijna kehete hai ki yah siddhant is baat ko saaf-saaf badal degaa ki china duniya main apni bhoomika kis tarah nibhaataa he
 For the past three decades, Chinese leaders have emphasized the "peaceful uplift" of the country as a permanent principle for their relationship with the world
 lambey vakt se ve apane purv netaa deng shyaoping ke usul—"vakt kaa intjaar karo, chamak ko chhipaaoy—par chalate aa rahe the
 Accordingly, he had decided the role and role of China as a follower rather than a vigilant country and a country that had created a us-led world order
 shi kaa vijan alabatta yah nahin he
 It is closely linked to his populist domestic agenda
 apane desh main communist party of china (sipisi) kii vaidhata ko majboot karne kii garaj se shi ke mansoobon ke centre main jo cheez he, vah he antarrashtriya falak par china kaa badhata kad or haisiyat—jise shi shchini raashtra kaa mahaan kayakalpya kehete hai—or uske saath desh main logon ke liye behatar jindagi yaa shi ke abhiyaan main jise "chini sapana'' kaha gaya he
 Says analyst Shea, "what She understands is that until now the legitimacy of the party has been tied to the transaction and is essentially the legitimacy of the work" and giving high growth rates has also been dependent on it
 shi jaanate hai ki acha vakt hameshaa nahin tik saktaa
 That's why Shea says, "they want more emotional confidence both in themselves and the party
 or china kii antarrashtriya pratishtha unke vijan kaa hissaa he
 '' And perhaps Xi's reputation as well
 beijing ke afasarshah jise shi kaa nayaa "agrasakriy'' najariya kehete hai, uskaa vaasta shakhsiyat or protocol se kahin zyada he—isane chini kootneeti ke lambey samay se sthapit buniyadi siddhanton ko ulatna-pulatna pehle hi shuru kar diya he
 These include principles ranging from "non-intrusive" in international disputes to non-operation of foreign military bases
 china hind mahaasaagar ke ain saamne jibooti main apana pehla sainya adda khol chukaa he
 More like this are being prepared - Gwadar in Pakistan, Seychelles maybe Vanuatu in the Pacific as well
 vuhaan kaa nateeja chaahe jo ho, hindustan china ke gahraate kshetreey asar ko lekar khaasaa chaukanna or saavdhaan he
 He is spreading this regional impact most through his Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which Xi considers not only to be a tool to increase China's strength and pressure, but also to present his country's rise
 Let's also see the importance
 purv british rajanyik or landan ke kings college main lau china institute ke professor tathaa diarector kerri brown kehete hai, "biarai darasal china ke liye vaidhata kaa jashn he
 In his country, he is passionately giving intoxicating messages that China is conquering modernity on its own
 ''yah shi ko america se hode karne kaa plateform bhi de rahaa he—isse vah ek alahada kism kii mahashakti kaa vikalp pesh kar rahaa he or "america first'' ke algaavvaadi vichaar ke vipareet vaishvikaran ke apane nazariye ko aage badha rahaa he
 Xi has given the nod for a more organized campaign to spread the Chinese model abroad, primarily through the BRI

 Brown says, "china abroad does not want to be a superpower like America — it knows its risks

 This has already been evident from Afghanistan to South Sudan and Myanmar, where Beijing has come forward to play the role of political middleman and in all three cases it has deep economic interests behind it
 pakistan shi ke liye us kasuti ke taur par ubhar rahaa he jahaan pataa chalegaa ki jab bade hit daanv par lage hon to beijing kis had tak dakhlandaji ke liye taiyaar he
 It is clear that Beijing has the ability and appetite to do so politically and favor one, even though it is currently taking steps keeping in mind its limitations and risks

 CPEC is a drastic change in the relationship between China and Pakistan, both in terms of quantity and quality, and it will see China engaging itself in almost every aspect of the Pakistani economy — what some critics have termed economic colonization
 china ke oonche daanv or jokhim kaa matlab yah he ki beijing ab gharelu maamalon main bhi sakriy khilaadi hoga or bharat ke saath apni sulah main bhi shaayad bas isi had tak jayega
 The author of the book "the China Pakistan Axis" and Andrew Small of the German Marshall Fund says, "CPEC is creating more bargaining needs with even more participants all over Pakistan and these deals are becoming more and more local Huh
 ''ve yah bhi kehete hai, "beijing ko pataa he ki akele centre sarkaar ke saath saudebaaji naakaafi he
 "in Afghanistan, too, China's role has changed from being a mere infrastructure builder to a more important political player and even hosting a dialogue between the Taliban and the Afghan government in China

 But the reality is that the BRI has been largely welcomed in Asia, especially given the widespread need to raise funds for infrastructure projects and the lack of alternatives
 magar shi kii pariyojna bhi jhatkon or hichkolon se mahfuj nahin he
 Japan's Nikkei study on BRI projects in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Kazakhstan, Bangladesh, Poland, Laos and Pakistan in April revealed significant delays in these projects
 inamen indonesia main 6 arab dollar kii railway pariyojna or kazakhstan tathaa bangladesh kii pariyojnaon main ho rahi deree bhi shaamil hai

 Finally, doing business with the shadow-bound government is also part of the "chinese perspective" and there is little emphasis on involving local communities
 yahi vajah he ki myanmar main mayitson baandh or srilanka main hambantota ke khilaaf sthaneey samudaay virodh pradarshan kar rahe hai
 It is still unclear whether China's diplomacy is smart enough to deal with these risks

 He also announced a new Chinese aid agency to give more importance and weight to overseas projects

 He is telling his members that he has released all the money, but a political party and STF have closed his company
 anubhav mittal kii taraf se sadasyon ko bheje ja rahe sandeshon main bataaya ja rahaa ki sabakaa pament olerady release kiya gaya he
 a payment of Rs 512 crore has been given to the bank
 tay taarikh ko sabake pament un logon ko mil sakate the, lekinraajnneetik party or STF ke dabaav ke kaaran uski company ko band kar diya gaya he
 Many similar messages are being sent to those putting money in the company of experience
 ye hai wo sandesh--sandesh main kaha ja rahaa he ki raajnneetik party chaahati he kianubhavunako ghoose den, jo anubhav dena nahin chaahate he
 Anubhav says that if he earns money from number one, then why will he give bribe? -political party and opponents have asked the media to show false news by giving money
 unhone yah bahut badi sajeesh rachi he
 Know how -dinesh naam ke ek vyakti kii juthi shikaayat par mukadmaa darj kiya gaya
 Because of which experiences are only in custody
 vah bel par kabhi bhi chhot sakate hai magar vah chaahate hai ki yah sachai sabake saamne aae ki soshal trade vaaki main kaise kaam karata he
 The case is a mixed conspiracy of Dinesh, an employee of STF, political party, opponents and media
 STF chaahati he ki chunaav ke is maahaul main bahut paise banaae jaaen
 It is being said in the messages that STF has already received money from opponents and political party for this work
 ab STF chaahati he ki anubhav se bhi paisa kamaaya jaae
 At the same time, the political party also wants to make money from experience
 -castady main anubhav se kaaphi poochtacha kii gai he
 In this inquiry, the police came to know that Anubhav's business is very clean, and he is paying equal taxes to the government
 -sandeshon ke mutabik dinesh naamak estkarmi FIR waapas lenaa chahta he, magar ab anubhav supreme court ke vakeelon kii madad se FIR waapas karaayenge or company ko phir chaalu karenge
 This work will take about a week

 His plot and plan failed
 unhone soshal trade ko bada scam bataaya he jo ki bahut bada jhooth he
 You all know that the company took money from NEFT and gave it to Associates from NEFT
 or tex bhi baraabar diya ja rahaa he
 - There has been a slight delay in payments due to site migration only in the month of January
 -ab STF, raajnneetik party, virdohi or media chaahate hai ki associats or sadsy soshal trade se apana paisa waapas maange, magar dekhne ko mil rahaa he ki associats company chaalu karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 And all our members are saying that the media is lying
 -sandesh main sadasyon se apil kii ja rahi he ki sabhi members is ghadi main sanyam banaaen rakhen or juthi media, STF kaa saath na den
 The media and the STF want us to complain to Anubhav Mittal's company, so that they get evidence that the allegations against them are true
 -sabhi sadsy sanyam banaaye rakhen or nakaaratmak naa sochen

 The BJP has become the largest party in the upper house after elections in 59 Rajya Sabha seats in 17 states of the country
 10 rajyon kii siton par 33 sadsy pehle hi nirvirodh nirvaachit ho chuke the
 The BJP won 12 seats in the elections held on 26 seats in 7 states on Friday
 1980 main bijepi kii sthapana hui thi
 It took him 38 years to become the largest party in the Rajya Sabha in terms of numbers
 shuukravaar der raat tak aae nateezon ke baadaitihaas main bijepine pehali baar bijepi ne 73 siton kaa aankada paar kar liya he
 The 12 seats won by the BJP also include Anil Aggarwal, who was fielded by the BJP as the 9th candidate in Uttar Pradesh
 9veen seat bijepi kii atirikt seat bhi thi, jis par puure din hai voltage drama dekhne ko mila
 SP and Congress together supported BSP candidate Bhimrao Ambedkar
 sattadhari bijepi or vipaksh ek-duusare par cross voting ke aarope lagaati rahi
 Ultimately, the BJP won
 uttar pradesh se 9 or jharkhand se ek, chhattisgarh se ek or karnataka se ek seat ke saath 12 rajyasabha siten bijepi ne shuukravaar ko jeet hasil kii he
 In this way, BJP has won 10 more seats this time
 in rajyon main pehle party ke paas mahaj paas sirf 2 siten thi, jo ab badhkar 12 ho gai hai
 bjp's winning member BJP has won from Uttar Pradesh, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, GVL Narasimha Rao, Kanta Kardam, Dr
 Anil Jain, Ashok Vajpayee, Vijay Pal Tomar, Harnath Singh Yadav, Sakaldeep Rajbhar and Anil Agarwal
 iske alaava karnataka se bijepi ke rajeev chandrashekhar, chhattisgarh se saroj pandeya or jharkhand se samir oran ne jeet darj kii he
 With the victory of BJP in the Rajya Sabha election, the strength of the party has now increased to 73
 jabaki mukhya vipakshi dal congress kaa rajyasabha me sankhya kam ho gai he
 The first time is that the number of Congress in Rajya Sabha has decreased so much
 bijepi upi kii rajyasabha chunaav main mili jeet cogorakhpur or phulpurmein loksabhaa upachunaav main mili haar ke paraajay kii bharpaai ke taur par dekh rahi he
 The BJP leaders said that Baqeed said that the by-election was done equally
 bataa den ki yogi adityanath or keshav prasad maury kii loksabhaa seat par pichley dinon hue upachunaav main basapa ke samarthan se sapa ne jeet darj kii thi
 In terms of the number of mlas in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP was set to win eight seats
 iske baad bijepi gathbandhan ke 28 vot atarikt bad rahe the
 In such a situation, BJP had fielded Anil Aggarwal as the 9th candidate in the Rajya Sabha elections
 jabaki sapa ke vidhayakon kii sankhya par ek seat tay thi
 After this, no party had the number to win a seat in the Rajya Sabha on its own
 basapa ne sapa or congress ke samarthan se apni ummidavaar utaara tha
 But the election of the 9th candidate of BJP was interesting
 satta paksh or vipaksh donon se dasvin seat jeetne ke liye harsambhav koshish kii gai
 a case of cross voting came to light
 iske alaava bispi ke ek or ek sapa vidhayakon jail main band hone ke chalate vot daalane kii anumati nahin mili
 As a result of this, Bhimrao Ambedkar, the common opposition candidate for the tenth seat, had to face defeat
