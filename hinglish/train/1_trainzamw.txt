 Senior Maharashtra BJP leader Eknath Khadse once again questioned his own government
 unhone mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis par apratyaksh rup se nishaanaa sadhate hue chuuhe maarane ke tender main ghotaale kaa aarope lagaaya
 He cited an RTI in the assembly saying that the government is claiming three lakh 19 thousand four hundred rats to be killed within a week
 rojaanaa nau ton se zyada yadi chuuhe maare gaye hai to unhen aakhir kaise thikaane lagaaya gaya
 Khadse has demanded an inquiry into the matter

 In a month, the ministry killed 3 lakh 19 thousand rats? Khadse quoted the Mumbai Municipal Corporation as saying that the Mumbai Manpa kills six lakh rats in two years
 vahiin, chote se mantralay main ek saptaah ke bheetar yani 3 may 2016 se 10 may 2016 tak teen lakh 19 hajaar chaar sau chuuhe maarane kaa karnama kar dikhaaya
 Khadse also made these allegations
 
 
 khadse yahi nahin ruke
 He alleged that how the company that was awarded the tender to kill mice killed more than 3 lakh rats in 7 days
 is kaam main to 6 maah kaa samay bhi kam pad jaataa he
 Khadse further questioned that the company which got the contract to kill rats did not have permission to bring poison in the ministry

 Even in this situation, if your computer gets hacked or someone else knows the password of your email ID, then you will be surprised
 lekin aisa sambhav he
 Possible because you are connected to the router and you do not obviously know that not only your computer or device will be connected to that router, but many computers or laptops will also be connected to it
 aap sicyor hai, lekin agar us router se internet chalaa rahe hai to aap hack ho sakate hai
 Because otherwise you will accidentally click a pop-up containing an ad that will contain DNS changer and get hacked
 samaj aayaa to thik he, lekin aap abtak nahin samajhen to yahsamajh len ki kisi vigyaapan vaale powep ko clic karne se bachein

 Apart from this, the management used to take out a procession about the circus party and animals

 After applying for this, there is a long wait
 vinod ke anusaar, sarkaar jab tak sarkas udyog ko bachaane ke liye madad nahin karegi, tab tak kuch nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It should be completely exempted from entertainment tax and for this, space should be provided at the lowest rate in the city

 Samar's son Ashok and Pradeep's wife Renu, who filed the petition, have requested the court to send their order dated 16 June 2016 to Yamraj
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki adaalat yamraj ko nirdesh de ki vah doshiyon ko dharti par waapas laae taaki ve nichali adaalat ke samaksh aatmasamarpan kar saken or kanoon ke tahat sunaayi gayi sajaa puri kar saken
 At first there was speculation, then signs were given, and then Priyanka Gandhi Vadra herself also said that if the party (congress) wants, she will contest from Varanasi against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but ultimately it is not happening now 
 unki party main faisle karne ke liye sarvocch pad par unke bade bhai or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi virajman hai, or unki maa sonia gadhi ke paas 'vito' kii takat he, to mumkin he, ghar main ratribhoj ke samay hui baatcheet, yaa kai baar hui baatcheet, ke baad yah faisla kiya gaya ho
 The choice was clear
 desh ke sabase shaktishaalee netaa ke saamne ladanaa unke rajnatik kariyar kii shandaar shuruyaat hota
 Even if defeated, it was certain that he would not, like a 'trainee' politician, be included in the line of serious, strong and capable fighting leaders who do not shy away from tough encounters
 agar vah modi kii jeet kaa antar kam kar paatin, to vah nishchit rup se congress kaa vahi 'brahmastra' sabit hotin, jiskaa darja unhen party main unke prashansakon ne diya he
 However, now that weapon has not been used
 
 
 so, ab sochate hai, kis vajah se priyanka gandhi wadra peeche hatin
 
 
 ? The Congress leaders i spoke with for this article told me two versions of this anecdote
 faisla karne kii prakriya se jude ek varisht netaa kaa kahana he, priyanka kabhi bhi gambhirtha se daud main shaamil nahin thim, or narendra modi ke khilaaf unki ummidavaari ke bare main party main sheersh str par charchaa tak nahin hui
 It started as a demand or request from enthusiastic activists, and the statements of the siblings were made only to increase the enthusiasm of the activists and to confuse the BJP
 lekin chunki 'modi banaam priyanka' jang kii kahani shuru hi priyanka ne kii thi, or 'congress ke bhitari logon' ne use jilaaye rakhaa, or phir rahul or priyanka, donon ne hi is bare main khulkar baat kii, isliye is theory par vishwaas karnaa mushkil he
 Another leader says, Priyanka wanted to fight, but Rahul and Sonia were not keen to start their political career with a defeat
 kai andruni survey main saaf dikhaa ki varanasi main modi ajey hai, or iske baavjood priyanka apane parivaar se alag soch rakhti thim
 According to a senior Congress leader, if Rahul Gandhi wins both Amethi (uttar Pradesh) and Wayanad (kerala) seats, Priyanka will be contested in the by-election in Amethi
 lekin kya vaastavik netaa itani dhaalon or surakshaskron ke peeche chhipaakar rakhe jate hai
 
 
 The Losing and winning happens to the public leaders
 yah sawaal kiijie, or congress ke paas koi jawaab nahin he
 In Uttar Pradesh, the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat came under the Samajwadi Party (SP) account under the Grand Alliance, and SP President Akhilesh Yadav was willing to remove his light-hearted candidate in support of him, happily considering Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as a joint alliance candidate
 parivaar kii taraf se varanasi kii sambhaavna par viraam laga die jane ke baad party netaa ab kah rahe hai ki priyanka un 18 siton par jamkar prachaar karengi, jahaan congress ko apni jeet kii sambhaavna nazar aa rahi he
 If it is believed that Modi is the main campaigner of the BJP, then keeping him tied up in Varanasi will also be considered as Priyanka's victory
 isi kahani ko diya gaya yah doosraa mode kori kalpana lagata he ki priyanka gandhi ko chunaav nahin ladvakar congress darasal uttar pradesh main mahagathbandhan kii madad karnaa chaahati he
 The best way to help the coalition would have been that the Congress would not contest elections from any seat except Amethi and Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh, and would have made the battle everywhere a BJP versus a joint opposition
 lekin iske bajaay congress mahagathbandhan ke hi vot kaategi
 Statistics show that BJP has always benefited in triangular bouts
 ab yah congress kii aadat ban gai he ki vah sabase bure halaat main pahunchakar ruk jaati he

 This is Ayushman, no respect
 ayushmaan khuranabachapan se hero bananaa chaahate the
 But to reach here, he sold many papad
 kai padaav paar kiye, logon ke kai taane bhi jhele
 But by rising he became a part of the film industry
 ek middle class parivaar se taalluk rakhane vaale ayushmaan kaa sapana, unka sangharsh or unki kahani hamamen se kai logon se mail khaati he
 Perhaps this is the reason why he wrote this book with his lecturer wife Tahira Kashyap
 'cracking da code' khaastaur se un logon ke liye likhi gai he, jo mynagari main jagah talash rahe hai
 All the things in the book have been spoken by Ayushman
 unhone apni lav life se lekar college life or phir reality sho kii duniya se lekar apni filmi safar tak ke kai kisse kitaab main share kiye hai
 As well as those codes, they have emphasized the gestures from which they proceeded with lessons
 haalanki kitaab ke pehle teen panne padhakar aisa lagegaa ki yah kitaab keval unke liye he, jo film industry main pahchaan bananaa chaahate hai
 But the way the author has put his personal life in front of people, many people can learn from this
 tamaam kisse kuch yun bayaan kiye gaye hai, jaise aap koi van act play dekh rahe hai
 When a Strugler tells the story of his Struggle himself, he is also trusted

 agar aap ye maanate hai ki ham dusron kii galati se kuch nahin sikh sakate

 Book: Mary Me Stranger (novel) Language: English Writer: Navneel Chakraborty Publisher: Random House India Price: Rs 105 'mary Me, Stranger' is no ordinary story of romance
 ho saktaa he ki ekbargi iske naam se aisa lage, lekin cover pej par kantedaar taron se bani ring kai sawaal jehan main chhod jaati he
 It is about a stranger chasing a girl who had no voice, no face, name or identity
 lekin ek makasad jarur tha
 There is a girl from Kolkata, Rivana Banerjee
 vah kaam ke silsile main mumbai chali aati he
 Life was going well in the strange city, but then the entry takes a stalker
 haalanki ek aashcharya yah bhi ki shuru main is baat se vah jaraa bhi hairaan-pareshaan nahin hoti
 Or perhaps not so surprising in the current era, where there is a plethora of pursuers and people trust the people of the virtual world too
 khayr, kahani kaa mukhya kirdaar lagane vaala yah 'ajanabi' khatarnaak to bilkul nahin tha, kyonki usne rivaana kii kai baar madad kii
 'everything has to be paid', warns Rivana and threatening her many times, he also warns readers
 rivaana uske bare main kuch nahin jaanati or uski hone or peechha karne ke tareekon ko raaj banaakar rakhti he
 But then one day after the threat, she decides to do something about it
 kitaab behad aasaan angreji main likhi gai he
 However, there are some unnecessary details in the beginning, such as the name of the cab service used by Rivana or the name of a local restaurant
 in naamon kaa kahani ke plot se koi rishta nahin he or sampreshan ke str par yah rukaawat hi paidaa karte hai
 However, as the story progresses, covering all the interesting aspects, you go on reading it
 alag-alag vyaktitv vaale kirdaaron ke byore bhi vistaar se die gaye hai
 Rivana, for example, appears to be a strong, self-reliant, thoughtful and extremely balanced girl in her life
 lekin mumbai main kuch samay se rah rahi apni dost ishita ke saamne vah purvagrahon vaali ek chote shahar kii dabbu ladki kii tarah lagati he
 While recovering from heartache and disarray, she encounters a new aspect of her personality
 sab kuch, us ajanabi shaks kii madad se
 In the book, lots of emotions like love, trust, separation, happiness, contentment, sorrow and fear come and go
 bade shahar main rahane vaali ek kunvaari ladki nishchit taur par in bhaawanaaon se khud ko jod paati he
 The stranger gives him many important lessons of life and along with Rivana you start thinking about this too
 ek jagah vah rivaana se kahata he, 'agar tumhaara dil bahut buree tarah nahin dukhaa he, to tum sikh nahin saktin
 You can't grow agar gro nahin kar saktin to ji nahin saktin
 If you cannot live then you will not know your price
 'lekin yah ajanabi he koun? vah rivaana kii madad kyon kar rahaa he? kya vah koi ladkaa he? kya rivaana ko raat main aane vaale sapanom kaa ajanabi se koi rishta he? in sawaalon se navneel kushalta or chaalaaki se deal karte hai
 To know the secret of the stranger, we have to wait for the next two books of this series
 kitaab kisi bauddhik pathan kaa hissaa nahin he, na hi bhashaa ke lihaaj se koi 'masterpis' he
 But it is a clever statement of a light, entertaining and exciting story of the new era

 Apart from this, the ministry has also sent a proposal to give a rebate of five per cent in import duty on liquid natural gas to reduce diesel consumption
 mantralay ko ummid he ki 2012−2013 ke bajet main agar vitt mantralay in prastaavon ko shaamil kar letaa he, to sarkaar kii revenyu main to badhotaree hogi hi saath hi desh main dijal kii khapat bhi kaaphi kam hogi
 The proposals have been prepared on the basis of the report of the Kirit Parikh Committee
 iske alaava mantralay ne dijal kii khapat kam karne ke liye liquyphid natural gas par emport duty main paanch fisadi ke chhot dene kaa bhi prastaav bheja he
 The Ministry hopes that if the Finance Ministry incorporates these proposals in the budget of 2012–2013, the government's revenue will increase as well as the consumption of diesel in the country will also be reduced considerably

 People who live alone or are less active on social media seem a little boring, but these people have an interesting feature
 ek shodh main khulaasa hua he ki khud ko rigerv rakhane vaale log yani kam ghulne-milane vaale log zyada intellegent hote hai
 This research has been done by the World Economic Forum
 yah shodh 18 se 28 saal ke kareeb 15 hajaar se zyada logon par kiya gaya he
 In this research, some special questions and answers related to his life were also done
 logon se milanaa julna unhen kitna acha lagata he yaa unke aas-paas kitni aabaadi rahati he, kuch is tarah ke sawaal shodh main puche gaye
 Research found that such people do not like more crowds
 zyada logon ko bich inhen ghutan mahasoos hoti he or yah khud ko us maahaul main dhaal nahin pate
 According to research, most intelligent people get less satisfaction by being constantly connected with friends
 in logon ke rigerv rahane ke kai kaaran ho sakate hai
 Perhaps intellectuals are more confident in focusing on their work
 duusari vajah yah bhi ho saktaa he ki unhen antarmukhi logon kii tarah khud ko hi richarge karne kii jarurat he

 unhone ultrasound karaayaa to pataa chalaa ki unka liver (yakrut) charbi ke kaaran safed or chamakdaar ho gaya he
 The fatty cells had spread their net, making the soft organs hard
 jab ilaaj shuru hua or unhen kshtprad liver biopsy, injection or dawaaon ke istemaal se guzarana padaa to unhone apane doctoron se sawaal kiya, ''mujhe is beemaari kaa koi sanket kyon nahin mila

 Doctors are warning of the danger of missing fat on an organ that no one can think of: a liver
 bharat ke shaharon main fatty liver kii beemaari kii shikaayat teji se bad rahi he
 Such fatty liver may be at risk of heart attack
 iske alaava isse cancer bhi ho saktaa he
 How serious this liver disease has become can be gauged from these facts: * 32% of Indians are estimated to have some degree of fatty liver disease
 *70 se 90 fisadi motaape or madhumeh ke shikaar log fatty liver kii beemaari se grast hai
 * 54 percent of people, who are neither obese nor abdominal, are fatty liver patients
 *24 fisadi bhartiya purush fatty liver se prabhavit hai, jabaki aisi mahilaon kii taadaad 13 fisadi he
 * 20 per cent of fatty liver disease takes serious form
 *liver ke vasa ke kaaran shahari bharatiyon ko dil kaa daura padane se maut ho jane yaa phir dil kaa daura padane kaa doharaa khatra hota he
 * Fatty liver is the third largest cause of severe liver disease in India
 *pashchimi deshon ke samaan vajan vaale logon ke mukaable bharatiyon main fat kii maatra doguni hoti he

 The liver is a missing link in the problem of obesity and now the pace of new research in this field is increasing
 akhil bhartiya str par koi adhyayan na hone se tukdon-tukdon main jo research ho rahaa he, usase yah samasya or bhi jatil hoti ja rahi he
 The head of the department of obesity, diabetes and metabolic diseases at Fortis Hospital in Delhi, Dr
 anup mishra kehete hai, ''internet par vaaya pubmed (pubmed ek internet search he, jisamen 2
 2 crore biomedical citations exist) Searching for medical data of non-alcoholic fatty liver found only 14 in 1995 and 36 research papers in 2000
 is vishay par pichley paanch varshon main prati varsh 200 se zyada lekh prakashit ho rahe hai
 "he says," Earlier fat accumulation in the liver was considered to be harmless, but today it is considered dangerous
 ”chandigarh main post graduate institute of medical ajukeshan and research (pijiiemiar) ke dow
 According to Ajay Duseja, fatty liver has recently been identified as a disease in India
 is vishay par abhi bahut kam research prakashit hua he
 Perhaps the reason for this is that earlier it was considered to be harmless and it was understood that it does not spread further
 iske alaava sara dhyaan viral hepatitis par diya ja rahaa tha
 Over the years, due to gross negligence of catering, Dharkar faced this problem of liver
 ve kehete hai, ''main samay se bhojan karne kii bajaae berokatoke junk food khaataa rahaa

 The lever neither beats nor maintains its pulse, nor does it sound nor shrink
 hriday ke vipareet yah dabaav main bhi kaam kar saktaa he
 The complex tasks the liver performs are all very important for good health
 yah apane upar pad rahe dabaav kaa sanket bhi nahin detaa he, jab tak uske saath bahut gambhir gadabad na ho rahi ho
 Dr
 nandi kehete hai, ''liver main khud ko dobaaraa majboot karne or thik karne kii gajab kii takat hoti he
 "despite the damage, it can work for years, but after a period of time, the damage has ruptured the liver so much that it becomes impossible to recover
" isiilie doctor liver kii bimariyon ko silent killer yani khamoshi se jaan lene vaali beemaari kehete hai
 Fatty liver disease begins when fat molecules accumulate in liver cells
 aisa motaape or madhumeh ke kaaran hota he
 Research shows that 70 to 90 percent of people suffering from obesity and diabetes suffer from this disease
 fatty liver kii beemaari varshon tak khamosh rahati he
 Once it occurs to a person who does not drink alcohol or drink less than 20 grams of alcohol per day, the doctor calls it non-alcoholic stiohepatitis (stio means fat and hepatitis means inflammation) or NASH
 agar eneese liver ko itnaa nuksaan pahunchaa detaa he ki use thik nahin kiya ja saktaa to aage chalakar serosis kii beemaari ho sakati he, liver kaam karnaa band kar saktaa he yaa phir cancer bhi ho saktaa he
 It is impossible to tell in advance which can cause cirrhosis and which can cause cancer
 lekin fatty liver kii beemaari jitne lambey samay tak chupa rahegaa, beemaari kaa khatra utani hi zyada hogi
 Fatty liver disease is the result of obesity, but it does not always appear in a particular form
 liver kii charbi un logon main bhi ho sakati he, jinka na vajan zyada he or na hi pet badha hua he
 In 2010, a study conducted by researchers from the Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research in Kolkata on a sample of about two thousand people showed alarming results: body mass index of 75% of people with fatty liver disease (according to height Weight) was lower than normal, while 54 percent of the people were not overweight

 It is one of the 10 biggest causes of death

 Unfortunately there is no cure for fatty liver disease or NASH yet
 aahaar main badlaav, shaareerik gatividhi or vajan kam rakhana hi ekmaatr ummid he
 Dr
 mishra kehete hai, ''sharir kaa vajan kam rakhane se laabh hota he
 "but rapid weight loss also causes damage to the liver
 baharhaal, aisa bhi nahin he ki fatty liver ke maamle main har taraf noummidi ke hi badal chhaae hon

 The recent survey conducted by the 'public Health Resource Network' has revealed the entire plan

 It has been found in the survey that people who had a smart card had to spend an average of Rs 7530 for common illness

 In areas like Surguja and Bastar, only 16 per cent claims were received under this scheme
 raipur, bilaspur or durg jaise bade shaharon main bane nijee hospitals kaa clem kaa aankada 63 fisadi se upar rahaa
 The Public Health Resource Network, citing its survey, said that only 13% of the card holders in the Baiga tribe, who were on the verge of ending, took advantage of the scheme

 Most of the claims that are being made by teeth, eye patients and many claims are being made of fake cases

 Dental doctors and hospitals have taken the most unfair advantage of the health insurance scheme

 According to these organizations, hundreds of private hospitals in Chhattisgarh are going round the health department to avail smart cards
 gyaat ho ki yahaan unheen aspataalon ko is yojana se joda ja rahaa he jo motaa kamishan dene ko raji ho rahe hai
 Therefore, this scheme is being used in a way like discount scheme and ATM card

 Initially, health card holders were being given free treatment up to 30 thousand rupees
 baad main sarkaar ne beemaa kii rakam 30 hajaar se badhaakar 50 hajaar rupee kar di
 As this amount increased, the scheme became a source of income for many private sector hospitals

 uski jaden gahari hoti hai
 Branches provide shade to the people
 
 
 sheetaltaa detii hai
 This should be the nature of the organization
 ' The Prime Minister also warned his leaders not to make rhetoric on every issue and said that there is a separate department to explain the party's vote on the issues
 piem ne saath hi kaha ki 'hamaari sarkaar ke abhi tak ke kaarykaal main aaj tak sarkaar par bhrashtachar kaa aarope nahin laga
 Not only economic corruption, but also no political charges
 ' The PM called upon the workers to say that they should not get entangled in the issues of waste, go on their agenda
 virdohi takaton kii koshish hamen uljhaae rakhane kii hogi or sarkaar ke kaaryon kii charchaa jansamanya main na hone paae, isaki koshish unki hogi

 'PM further said,' BJP workers should work with creative thinking
 samaaj ke sabhi virgon tak kaaryakartaaon kii pahunch ho
 Activists need to join campaigns like Swachhta Abhiyan and Beti bachao-beti Padhao
 ' He also alerted the activists that 'the opposing forces can try to confuse the unprecedented work of our government by raising issues of waste so that it does not reach the masses
 kaaryakartaaon ko isse puri tarah aprabhavit rahanaa he
 Work proactively in bringing the creative works and development of your government to the people
 ' Also, the PM said that this time the budget was excellent
 bajet main shaamil badi-badi chizon ke alaava choti choti baton ko jan-jan tak pahunchaaen
 For example, small shops in the country will also be open seven days a week and late at night

 The comments piem ne kaha ki 'hamaari sarkaar kaa ahm nirnay desh ke saadhe 18 hajaar se adhik gaanv, jinhen aazaadee ke baad bhi bijli nahin mili, vahaan bijli pahunchaana he
 Out of these, our government has achieved success in providing electricity in more than one year in more than six and a half thousand villages
 31 march 2017 tak sabhi 18 hajaar gaanvon main bijli kii roshni pahunchane kaa lakshya puraa ho jayega
 The PM also said that 'people who have lived in the darkness for so many years after getting independence, people cannot understand their pain, desperation, so go to such villages and bring energy program with them 
 ' He also discussed in the speech the success of the recently held international conference of the Sufi sect
 baithak samaapan ke baad kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ne media ko press conference kar piem dwaara die gaye bhaashan se avgat karaayaa
 Rajnath told that the PM told the workers, 'we have to develop our organization as a vat tree

 Gives coldness
 aisa sanghathan kaa swaroop hona chahie
 ' pradhanmantri ne apane netaaon ko har mudde par bayaanbaji na karne ko lekar bhi chetaya or kaha ki muddon par party ke mat ko spasht karne ke liye ek alag vibhaag he
 The PM also said that 'till date our government has not been accused of corruption till date
 keval aarthik bhrashtachar hi nahin, balki koi raajnneetik aarope bhi nahin laga
 ' piem ne kaaryakartaaon se aahvaan karte hue kaha ki 'vah vyarth ke mudon main na ulajhein, apane agenda par chalem
 The effort of the opposing forces will be to confuse us and it will be their effort to not discuss the government's actions in the public
 ' Rajnath said that the PM gave the example of Mahatma Gandhi in his speech, saying that 'gandhiji used to connect the issues related to the earth with the freedom struggle of India, keeping it on his agenda
 ' piem ne aage kaha, 'bhaajapa kaaryakarta rachanaatmak soch ke saath kaam karen
 Workers should have access to all sections of the society
 kaaryakartaaon ko swatchta abhiyaan or beti bachaao-beti padhaao jaise abhiyaanon se judane kii aavashkayata he
 ' saath hi unhone kaaryakartaaon ko satark karte hue kaha ki 'virdohi takatein vyarth ke mudde uchhaalkar hamaari sarkaar ke abhootpurv kaaryon ko uljhane kii koshish kar sakati hai, taaki vah jansamanya tak na pahunch saken
 The workers have to remain completely unaffected by this
 apni sarkaar ke rachanaatmak kaaryon or vikaas ko jan-jan tak pahunchane main sakriyata se kaam karen
 ' saath hi piem ne kaha ki is baar kaa bajet shandaar rahaa
 In addition to the big things included in the budget, make small things accessible to the people

 But cleaning the bathroom is not so easy
 kitni bhi mehnat kar lo, koi na koi daag dhabba to rah hi jaataa he
 In such a situation, if you use some household items, you can easily remove the stubborn stains of the bathroom
 jaane kaise
 
 
 Cleanse with Naqam and Lemon, especially if the Voss Basin is cleaned with salt and lemon, then the Voss Basin will start glowing in a few moments
 namak or neembu kaa ghol banaakar use was basin par laga den or 15 minute baad use garm pani se dho den
 You will be surprised to see the cleanliness and shine of the Voss Basin, it will also give a good fragrance
 ek chutki namak se dur hogi ghar kii negativitybathroom flush ko sirka se chamakaaembathroom kaa flush saaf karne ke liye sirka or neembu kaam aaenge
 Add lemon and salt to the vinegar and apply it on the flush
 20 minute ise chhodane ke baad flush kar den
 By doing this, any kind of stubborn stains will end and the bathroom will start glowing

 You can use an old tooth brush instead
 sabun yaa surf kaa ghol banaaen or usamen brush dubo kar khidakiyon or daravaajon ko saaf karen
 With the help of vinegar, if the scum settles on the nalnal, it does not leave easily
 aise main aap sirka kii madad se nal par jami ziddee gandagi kaa bhi saaf kar sakate hai
 Soak cotton in vinegar and rub it on the tap
 isse nal chamak jayega
 Always keep these five things in the kitchen clean

 Cut the potato and rub it on the bathroom tiles
 15 minute tak use chhod den
 Then wash the tiles with warm water

 ) Times have changed a lot
 ek samay hua karata tha jab ladakiyon kii shaadi 25 paar karne se pehle hi kar di jaati thi lekin aaj praathamiktaayen badal gai hai
 Now most girls start thinking about marriage after crossing 30
 ab unki praathamikta shaadi karnaa nahin balki khud kaa kariyar bananaa ho gaya he
 By the age of 30, they get married and start planning their family somewhere after two to three years
 isi ke saath yah jaananaa jaruri he ki badhati umr ke saath hi garbhvatee hone or bachche ko janm dene se judi kai samasyaayein ho jaati hai, jisamen maa or bachche, donon ke liye hi khatra hota he
 Although alternatives such as IVF and surrogacy are also becoming quite prevalent, it cannot be denied that there is no 100% chance of succeeding them
 to jaane ki 35 ke baad maa banane par mahilaon ko in samasyaon se guzarana padataa he:1
 Most deliveries after 35 are by surgery
 aisi sthiti main normal delivery hone ke chasenj bahut kam rahete hai
 If you are over the age of 35 and you want to become a mother then first contact the doctor
 2
 Fetal development is not normal in women who conceive after 35 years
 yaa to vah bahut chota hota he yaa bahut bada
 Due to this, the child born can also have a disorder
 yah sthiti maa ke liye bhi sahi nahin he
 3
 35 ke baad garbh dhaaran karne vaali mahilaon main ucch raktchaap kii samasya hone kii ashanka kaaphi bad jaati he
 The condition of high blood pressure is neither good for the mother nor for the child
 4
 The risk of diabetes also increases due to the effect of age
 madhumeh kii sthiti bahut khatarnaak sabit ho sakati he or khaastaur par agar bachche kaa janm surgery se hota he to yah jaanaleva bhi ho saktaa he
 5
 35 ke baad garbh dhaaran karnaa kaaphi mushkil ho jaataa he lekin usase bhi bura yah he ki umr ke is padaav ke baad garbh dhaaran karne par garbhpaat hone kii ashanka bahut adhik bad jaati he

 According to Arvind Kejriwal, just as there is a 'swachh Bharat' campaign, so is a clean politics campaign
 
 
 jab tak raajnneeti saafe nahin hogi, tab tak desh saafe nahin hoga
 According to Kejriwal, if a big corporate house gives a large amount of money, then it also takes advantage of the latter, because political parties do not keep the way of receiving donations transparent
 
 
 isi vajah se aaj kii raajnneeti main janata ke liye hitkaari faisle lene kaa abhaav he
 Kejriwal gave an example that if a power company would donate to a party, after the election, it would like the electricity rate to rise
 
 
 
 And if the public will give money and vote, then the rate of want will decrease
 isliye ham janata se paise maang rahe hai
 Kejriwal also said that he is not against any company, but he will not accept a huge donation from any corporate, so that after the election, the corporate should not ask him to do such a thing wrongly
 kejariwal ne kaha ki unka tarika paardarshee he, jabaki bijepi vaale kabhi apane chanda dene waalon kaa naam nahin bataate
 He also believed that this campaign is political and is also a way to pressure other parties

 Earlier, the three parts of the Indian Army had been doing different combat exercises with the US Army
 lekin ye pehali baar hoga jab dono deshon kii thal sena, vaayu sena or nausena ek saath yuddh abhyaas karegi
 On this issue, India's Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's discussion between US Secretary of State Mike Ponpio and Defense Minister James Mattis in a two plus two meeting in September is possible
 isse pehle is maamle main america raksha mantri james mattis kii pichley varsh hui bharat yatra ke dauraan nirmala sitaraman ke saath vistaar se charchaa hui thi

 Do you remember the movie 'A Wednesday', which came nine years ago! Naseeruddin Shah, playing the role of common man in the film, calls and threatens Mumbai Police Commissioner Prakash Rathore (anupam Kher)
 ye phone kahaan se or kis number se kiya gaya, iskaa pataa police mahakme kii sibar wing lakh koshish karne ke baad bhi nahin laga paati
 a 16-year-old boy does the same in a pinch
 digital india kii ore badhata desh ab aisi hi sthiti se bachane ke liye taiyaar ho rahaa he
 Today, from metro to airport, nuclear power plant, banking and transport, all these are being digitally operated
 inkaa sarwar hack kar badi vaardaat ko anjaam diya ja saktaa he
 To overcome such hackers, the government is preparing to form its own team of hackers
 athical havers kii ye team sarkaar ko bataaegi ki unke sarwar ko havers tabaahi machaane ke iraade se kin-kin tareekon se hack kar sakate hai
 For this, the central government is going to organize 'hackathon', in which hackers will be set up by setting up servers used for metro, airport, nuclear plants
 yehekarsis sarwar ko hack karne kii koshish karenge, jisase kamajoriyon or khaamiyon kaa pataa lagaaya ja sake
 Based on this, the real server will be made more secure
 ek adhikari ne bataaya ki ‘haikathan’ ke liye rajdhani main ek sarwar range banaaya jayega, jo hoobahoo metro, airport, power plant, railway ke network jaisaa hoga
 If these ethical hackers break into this server, then we will get to know our weaknesses, which will be useful for us
 aise main tabaahi machaane ke iraade se sarwar hack karne waalon se ham saavdhaan ho sakate hai
 These ethical hackers will detect vulnerabilities of the government's digital defense system
 20 november se shuru hone vaale global conference on sibar spes 2017 main hi haikathan kaa aayojan hoga, jiskaa udghaatan piem narendra modi karenge
 120 countries will participate in it
 is kaarykram kaa aayojan neshnal critical information infrastrcchar protection centre (NCIIPC) ke antargat hoga
 Governments moving towards e-governance will try to make their servers and data more secure through hackathon
 dilli jaise shahar havers ke nishane par hai
 Therefore, the entire focus of the government is to make necessary arrangements in advance to avoid such hackers
 sarkari agenciyaan havers se bachane ke liye quick hill jaisi nijee companiyon se madad le rahi hai
 According to sources, Japan, Egypt, Israel and Russia have also been talked about

 On December 23, Shilpa Shetty apologized on Twitter for using the word casteist
 shilpa or salmaan khan ke khilaaf shanivaar ko exiaar darj kii gai thi
 Shilpa tweeted - My old interview words were misrepresented
 wo shabd kisi kii bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchane ke makasad se nahin bole gaye the
 Some of my words from an interview in the past have been misinterpreted
 It was never said with the intent of hurting anyone’s feelings
 
 
 - SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA (@theshilpashetty) December 23, 2017 In another tweet, he wrote - i apologize if someone's feelings are hurt
 i apologize if they have
 I'm proud to belong to a country that boasts of diverse castes and creeds and i respect each one of them
 🙏🙏— SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA (@theshilpashetty)december 23, 2017vivaadit tippanee kii vajah se republican kaaryakarta salmaan kii film tiger jinda he kaa virodh bhi kar rahe hai
 Reports of the film's protests have also been reported in Rajasthan, UP and Gujarat
 jaipur ke raaj cinemahol main film ke sho ke dauraan todphod kii bhi ghatana hui
 Salman's protest is reportedly due to a viral video 5 years old
 salmaan khan ek jatisuchak shabd kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Valmiki society has strongly objected to this word
 salmaan ke coment se bhadki RPI ne di pradarshan kii dhamkee, badhaai gai surakshaisase pehle shuukravaar ko puure maamle main neshnal kamishan for shedul trib ne notice jari kar soochna evam prasaaran mantralay or dilli-mumbai ke police kamishnurs se 7 din main jawaab maang chukaa he
 In this regard, the Valmiki society says that the use of the wrong word in public has hurt the feelings of our society
 bataa den ki salmaan ne paanch saal pehle apni film 'ek tha tiger' ke pramotion ke dauraan neshnal tivi par apane dance style ko bataane ke liye jatisuchak shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha
 While Shilpa said during a conversation with the media that she is dressed in a 'special way' at home
 sanjay lila bhansaali kii film 'padmavati' par vivaad thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 In Rajasthan, Rajput women have also come out in protest against the film Padmavati
 aaj jaipur main kareeb 200 rajput mahilaon ne sadak par utarkar pradarshan kiya
 Rajput women objecting to Ghoomar warned Sanjay Leela Bhansali that if the film was released without showing it to the Rajputs, it is not good
 in kshatraani mahilaon kaa aarope tha ki jis tarah se film main rani padmavati ko ghumar nrity karte dikhaaya gaya he, wo thik nahin he
 In this film, Deepika Padukonan in the role of Rani Padmavati is neither in Rajput dress nor does Rajput look like a heroine
 isliye is film ko pehle rajput samaaj ko dikhaaya jaae or uske baad hi film relies ho
 They allege that what is shown in the trailer itself does not look right
 inkaa aarope he ki rajputi dress main mahilaon ke haath-pair nahin dikhte hai or raniyaan sabake saamne nrity nahin karti thim
 Manisha Singh of Rajput Mahasabha, who is leading the women, said that we will not allow the film to be released in the present form under any circumstances
 purv rajkumaari bhi naarajais bich jaipur samet kai purv raaj gharaanon ne bhi is film ke virodh main morcha khol diya he
 Former Jaipur princess Dia Kumari says that it is a question of feelings for us
 padmavatihamaare liye devi kii tarah hai or unhen ghumar karte hue ham nahin dekhnaa chaahate hai
 It is alleged that at the beginning of shooting of the film in Sanjay Leela Bhansali, it was said that the film will be shown to the people of the society on completion
 lekin wo apane vaade se peeche hat rahe hai or film ke prachaar ke liye is tarah ke hatkande apana rahe hai
 In support of Bhansali, many big politicians have come out in the film industry, against Pachipadmavati
 haalanki film industry se sanjay lila bhansaali ko majboot saport mila he
 On Monday, five organizations of the film industry met and said that the government should provide a safe environment for the release of Padmavati
 bhansaali ko mil rahi dhamkiyon or padmavati par virodh ke khilaaf manoranjan jagat ke paanch sanghathan 16 november ko 15 minute ke liye shooting par roak lagaakar apana virodh jaahir karenge
 Before that, Deepika has raised many questions
 safai de chuke hai bhansalibta den kipadmavatimen allaudin khilji or rani padmini ke bich dream sikvence ko lekar vivaad tha jis par mekars kii ore se safai aa chuki he
 Bhansali recently said once again on social media that there is no such sequence in the film
 ye film 1 disambar ko relies honi he
 Apart from this, all development work comes to a standstill due to election conduct, but Nitish said that his support should not be construed that elections will be held with the coming Lok Sabha in Bihar
 is sambandh main sari atakalon ko khaarij karte hue unhone kaha ki philhal aisa koi prastaav nahin he
 Earlier, the party's Bihar unit president Vashistha Narayan Singh supported the central government on this issue
 unhone laga tha ki jo bhi sanshodhan centre sarkaar laaegi party uskaa khulkar samarthan karegi, lekin aaj nitish ne yah bhi kaha ki is mudde par puure desh main bahes bhi karai jaani chahie

 In the desire to become a peon, such a crowd gathered that the administration lost its hands
 ji-iesai health care haryana main disi rate par nikali chaturth shrenee ke 70 padon par bhartee ke liye rajya bhar se yuvaaon kii bheed umad padin
 The qualification for the post of peon was eighth pass but more than ten thousand youth holding ma-b
ed-b
tech degree reached here
 lekin bheed dekhakar ghabaraae prashasan ne bhartee sthagit kar daali
 This is the state of Haryana, where the Chief Minister of the state is more worried about the ban on Padmavat, however, how the youth of the state are anxious to become a peon
 kyonki sawaal sirf karnal main umadi bheed kaa nahin he
 In Jind's court, 15 thousand applicants for 9 posts of peon had reached for interview
 chand dinon pehle maharishi dayanand uniwarsity main chaparasi ke 92 padon ke liye kareeb 22 hajaar aavedan aae the
 That is, you need a job to fill your stomach and if you get a job of a peon, no one will be averse because there is no job
 or haal sirf haryana kaa kharaab he-aisa bhi nahin he
 a fortnight ago, among the 12,453 people interviewed for peon jobs in the Rajasthan Legislative Secretariat, there were 129 engineers, 23 lawyers, a chartered accountant and 393 post graduates
 had yah ki job mili to unamem vidhayak kaa betaa shaamil tha, yani vidhayak kaa betaa bhi ab chaparasi banane ko taiyaar he
 Or to say that if there is a job, then the son of the right legislator is not averse to a peon's job in the vicinity of Jugaad
 aise main sawaal desh main saadhe chaar karod se zyada registerd berozegaar hai, or padhe likhe yuva chaparasi tak banane ko bekaraar hai to phir sarkaar kii rojgaar niti kaa matlab he kya? kyonki sach to yahi he ki sarkaar yah maanane ko taiyaar hi nahin ki desh main rojgaar kaa sankat he
 If the top BJP leaders reject the unemployment crisis in the country around the currency scheme, then the Prime Minister does not hesitate to say that the unemployment talks are meaningless, and now the brokers have a job crisis
