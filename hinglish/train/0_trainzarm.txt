 Two senior IAS officers are surrounded by questions after this investigation, on which the inquiry committee has raised serious questions
 yogi sarkaar ne is maamle ko sibiai ko dene kaa man bana liya he aise main gomti riverfrant se jude rahe do senior iees adhikariyon par bhi ghotaale main shaamil hone ke gambhir aarope lage hai
 The investigation report of the Gomti River Front project is currently highly confidential but a copy of it has been handed over to Aaj Tak
 is jaanch report main is pariyojna se jude senior iees adhikari jo ki mukhya sachiv rank ke the, saath-saath lagbhag darjanabhar ejeeniyar or chif ejeeniyar par gambhir aniyamiton ke aarope lagaae gaye hai
 In this report, the then Chief Secretary and Principal Secretary of the state have serious allegations of enactment on irrigation
 jaanch samiti ne pariyojna kii laagat or bhugtan main gambhir vittiya aniyamitataayen pai hai
 The report said that there have been serious irregularities in the tenders of the Gomti River Front project
 saath hi manamaane dhang se tender baante gaye, blike listed companiyon ko bade kaam die gaye hai
 The inquiry committee has also raised serious questions over the assignment of Gameon India
 jaanch samiti ne likhaa he ki pashchim bengal, rajasthan or dilli main yah company blike listed he jisaki soochna internet par bhi he baavjood iske is form ko itane bade anubandh die gaye
 The biggest work of the project was the work of Diaphragm Wall which was contracted with Gammon India Limited
 isi form ko rabar dam kaa bhi bada kaam diya gaya or anuchit tareeke se laabh pahunchane ke liye 100 karod se zyada kii parformens guarantee bhi nahin lee gai
 In the investigation report, the project's chief engineer has been prima facie convicted
 jaanch samiti ne report main likhaa he kii diaphram wal nirmaan main aavanton se 29 pratishat zyada kaa vyay hua he
 Expenditure has been more than the allocation of 22
5% in the rubber dam
 tairta fawwara main 585 pratishat zyada vyay hua he jabaki diaphram wal kii dizin or drawing main 264 pratishat zyada vyay hua he
 In its report, the inquiry committee has raised questions about diversion of funds as well as no cher and balances in the project
 task force ko lekar rajya ke mukhya sachiv or pramukh sachiv sinchai par bhi gambhir sawaal khadey kiye gaye hai report main likhaa he kii mukhyamantri ke dream project or kaam sheeghra khatm karne ke aad main is pariyojna se sambandhit ejiniyaron nemanamane dhang kuch kaam kiye
 The most serious questions have been raised in the report on the then Principal Secretary of Irrigation and it is written that Chief Engineer Irrigation, who came to see the work on the spot from 20 to 25 times, used to come on the spot every other third day, yet the shocking thing is that the objectionable Why the matter of financial irregularities did not come to his notice, who was also a member of the task force formed to prevent financial irregularities
 yahi vajah he ki is jaanch report main puri pariyojna main vittiya aniyamitata ko 'daal main namak nahin balki namak main daal' kii sangya di gai he
 In its conclusion, the Judicial Inquiry Committee has written that the High Level Task Force which was formed under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary and in which the then Chief Secretary Irrigation was the then Chief Engineer and other Engineers are all prima facie guilty

 yani ab desh ek baar usee sthiti main pahunch jayega, jahaan do maheene pehle tha
 The government also did not change and the Prime Minister is also Narendra Modi
 aaj shuukravaar he or do din baad may maheene kaa aakhri ravivaar bhi he
 But there is a question
 
 Will Prime Minister Narendra Modi do his 'mann ki Baat' to the people of the country on this Sunday? This question is because till March, April and now May the code of conduct was in force in the country, in such a situation, he was not talking about the mind
 apni aakhri man kii baat yani 24 farvari ko unhone elaan kiya tha ki ab may ke aakhri ravivaar ko hi man kii baat karenge
 Then political analysts questioned him whether Narendra Modi had enough faith that he would become Prime Minister again
 Discussing several subjects during # mannkibaat
 Tune in
 https: / / t
 co / rgaogmogjp — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 24, 2019 What did PM say in the last Mann Ki Baat? In the Mann Ki Baat addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 24 February, he paid tribute to the soldiers who were martyred in the Pulwama attack
 
 is man kii baat ke do din baad hi bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan main ghuskar airstrike kii thi
 He said in this matter of mind, '
 
 
 march maheene main loksabhaa chunaav kii prakriya shuru ho jaaegi, vah bhi is baar bataur pratyaashee chunaav main ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, when the code of conduct comes into force, he will not be able to talk about the mind
 loktantr kaa sammaan karte hue agali man kii baat may maheene ke aakhri ravivaar ko karenge
 'now Narendra Modi has once again returned by winning with a thumping majority, he can also take oath on 30th May
 or ravivaar 26 may ko he
 Another connection is also connected with 26 May
 26 may 2014 ko hi narendra modi ne pehali baar pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lee thi
 In such a situation, Narendra Modi can again speak his mind to the public on this day

 Dhoni's dismissal proved to be the worst for the bookies, as all his money was lost
 jinhone newjiland par paisa lagaaya tha, unki jeb bhar gai
 Rajiv Singh (fictitious name), a bookie based in Sadar Bazar, Gurugram, told IANS: "the betting market was changing when India's top-3 batsmen returned to the pavilion for a total of five
 hamaari ummiden kal zyada thim, lekin aaj bharat kii haar ke saath yah world cap kii sabase buree khabar sabit hui
 "he told," Apart from Grugram, several bookies in Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Delhi had arranged parties in five-star hotels, but all had to cancel it at the last minute
 'kohli par laga chokar kaa thappa, bharat ko nahin dilaa paae bada khitabanujiland ke upar satta lagane vaale dilli ke ek sattebaaj ne kaha, 'jab bharat ke chaar wicket gir gaye the tab main kaaphi khush tha
 i was still quite happy when the Indian bowlers were not in good form - it was because i had invested all the money on New Zealand
 maine bada jokhim liya tha or yah lottery sabit hua
 "A bookie from Satta Mandi in Ghaziabad said," We lost badly today
 yahaan tak ki satr dar satr ke satte main bhi hamen kaaphi nuksaan uthaanaa padaa, kyonki hamane dhoni or jadeja par bhi paisa lagaaya tha
 'delhi's Sattabazar was very high on Tuesday

 pakistan main buudhvaar ko aitihaasik kartarpur sahib gurudwara kii aadharshila rakh di gai
 The Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan laid the foundation stone for this
 is samaaroh main bharat sarkaar ke pratinidhi ke taur par pahunchin kendriya mantri harsimrat cor badal or punjab sarkaar ke mantri navjot singh siddhu va pakistani vaktaaon ke bich coridor ke credit ko lekar jubaani jang dekhne ko mili
 Navjot Singh Sidhu, who arrived at the program on the call of Imran Khan, was the first to give a speech, in which he insisted on peace and peace between the two countries
 siddhu ne donon deshon ke bich baatcheet kaa rasta kholane ke liye kartarpur coridor ko ek badi pahal bataaya
 Along with this, Sidhu read aloud for the corridor in praise of his friend and Pak PM Imran Khan and thanked the two governments for the corridor
 siddhu ne kya kahasiddhu ne kaha, 'bahut nuksaan ho gaya he
 Now the bloodline should stop and no mother's lap should be destroyed
 koi is aag par pani daalane vaala hona chahie
 This is how i see this corridor

 Whenever the history of Kartarpur will be written, on the first page the first name of your (imran) name will be written
 ''teen maheene main hua chamatkaar'beete agast main imran khan ne pakistan kii kaman sanbhali thi or navjot singh siddhu unke shapath grahan samaaroh main shirkat karne bhi gaye the
 There he was hugged by Pak Army Chief Vajwa
 siddhu kii vaapasi par is masale par desh main kaaphi bavaal bhi hua tha
 But while giving a speech at the foundation stone program of the Corridor on Wednesday, Sidhu did not forget to say that this is a miracle, which has not been done in 70 years, it happened in three months
 ' aise kehete hue siddhu ne ye bhi kaha ki imran khan ne apana vachan nibhaayaa he or hindustan kii sarkaar ne iskaa istakabal kiya he
 What Harsimrat Kaur said: Harsimrat Kaur, a minister in the Modi government, said in his speech after Sidhu that today is a historic day and years of worship of Sikhs have been completed
 unhone kaha ki yah hamaare liye bahut khushi kaa mauka he, kyonki saat maheene pehle hamaari party ne jo maang rakhi thi, wo aaj puri ho gai he or pradhanmantri narendra modi ne yah faisla lekar sikhon ko bada tohfa diya he
 Harsimrat said that this corridor is being built to eradicate the bitterness of both the countries
 iske liye apni or aapaki sarkaar kii is pahal kaa main swaagat karti hum or yaheen se donon deshon ke bich kii nafrat khatm ho sakati he
 As soon as Harsimrat's statement was completed, the man who was conducting the program immediately said that it was possible at the initiative of Imran Khan
 unhone kaha, 'vajeer-e ajam imran khan ne hindustan ko ofer diya tha, jise unhone sweekaar kiya
 He was seen saying through a poetry that Imran Khan has forced Hindustan to accept this offer
 is tarah pakistan jahaan coridor ke liye imran khan ko credit detaa rahaa, vahiin navjot singh siddhu bhi unheen kii tarif karte dikhaai die
 However, he thanked both the countries for this
 lekin jab mauka harsimrat cor ko mila to vah apni party or pradhanmantri modi kii ichhashakti or nirnay ko is pahal kii sabase badi vajah bataa gayi

 JBL LIVE200BT Wireless in-ear Neckband Headphones Review: Last month, JBL launched five live series headphones in India
 inamen se ek neckband pattern vaala in-year headphone- JBL Live 200BT tha
 The company had priced it at Rs 5,299
 haalanki abhi ise 3,999 rupee main cell kiya ja rahaa he
 We have used it and now we are going to bring its review to you
 dizin or confortaajkal netband pattern vaale wireles headfones kii bazaar main kaaphi demand he
 There are quite a few headband patterned headphones in the market
 baharhaal, isaki bild quality kii baat karen to iske nek porshan main soft rabar kaa istemaal kiya gaya he, joki kaaphi flexible he
 Also there are hard plastics in the left and right portions
 yahaan rhite said main saare control buttens die gaye hai
 The wire provided to connect the earphones to the neckband is quite small and has a fabric coating
 aise main isane rakhane main or istemaal karne main behad aasaani hoti he
 Its placement is done in such a way that it stays just under the ear at the time of use
 acchhee baat ye he ki isamen yearbads ko kaanon main behatar grip or behatar sound output ke liye ek khaas angel diya gaya he
 The plastic panel on its right side has two LED indicators (charging and connectivity), micro USB charging port, microphone and power on / off switch inside
 ise conect karnaa behad aasaan he
 a separate switch is provided for the power button, for which only single access is sufficient
 duusari taraf yani baahar kii taraf halkaa sa ubhara hua multi batan he or wolum rockers hai
 Multi button can be used to activate Google Assistant or Siri on song play / pause, call cut / receive and double tap
 vahiin wolum rockers ko kuch second tak hold kar rakhane se song ko previous yaa next kiya ja saktaa he
 However i would like to tell you here that its volume rockers have some difficulty in using it
 kyonki wolum rockers ko multi batan kii tulana main thodaa kam ubhaar diya gaya he
 In this case, a little straggling is required while using it
 mumkin he ki company ne multi batan ke iji acces ke liye aisa kiya hoga, lekin isi vajah se dikkat bad jaati he
 Talking about its overall build quality, it is very easy to use and the body material is also very strong and luxurious
 lekin dikkat ye he ki ye dikhne main itnaa acha nahin he
 That is, the first thing is that the wires given to attach the earphone to the noseband are small
 inhen agar magnet se atech karen to iskaa luk acha nahin aata
 Apart from this, none of these magnets play / pause
 iske alaava ye shart ke upar pahanane par kaaphi broad dikhataa he
 That is, it can hardly be called casual, semi-casual or sporty for any look
 isi tarah thodi dikkat shart pahanane ke dauraan ye bhi ho sakati he ki yadi collar se microphone dhank jaaen to kol ke dauraan baat karne main mushkil hoti he or vir bhi funsane lagate hai
 It also starts sliding when there is a slight miss balance
 yahi is neckband main thodi bahut pareshaaniyaan hai
 Performance Here 8mm dynamic drivers are given
 hamanen is yearphone ko clasical, cicedelik rock, jaij, rock, dabstep, EDM, BDM, metal, trans or fok jaise kai jonurs ke saath istemaal kiya he
 These in-ear Bluetooth headphones deliver amazing audio output in almost every genre
 yahaan Highs, Mids or Lows saare hi parfect hai
 Especially the output of the sub-base is so punchy and crispy that you will enjoy it a lot
 jitna Lows kaa output shandaar he utana hi Mids or Highs bhi sharp or clin hai
 The special thing is that in this wireless headphones, you will not be irritated even at full sound
 aise main keemat ke lihaaj se ise main sound quality 5 / 5 dena pasand karuunga
 Bullets Wireless headphones of this price range oneplus also comes, which cost Rs 3,990
 hamanen ise bhi istemaal kiya tha, lekin JBL ke Live 200BT kii audio quality zyada behatar he
 Talking about calling performance, since it does not have the feature of active noise cancellation, it can be a problem to talk while walking fast in places like the market or bike
 baaki regular kol main koi dikkat nahin aegi
 Apart from this, it takes 2 hours to fully charge the battery, and once fully charged, we put it around 9
 5 ghante tak chalaaya he
 In this context, battery performance is also very strong
 faislaluk ke maamle main bas ye headphone thodaa niraash kar saktaa he
 For the rest of the audio lovers, it can be called the best wireless Bluetooth earphone in the budget range
 aise main mujeec ke shaukin isamen aaraam se paisa laga sakate hai

 sikkim ke nathu-laa paas pahunche maansarovar yatra ke do jatthon ko china ke border se waapas lautaa die jane kii khabar se rajdhani dilli main tehre hue tisare jatthe ke yatriyon kii chintaa bad gai he
 Arrangements for accommodation for people going to Mansarovar Yatra in Delhi remain in Gujarati Samaj Bhavan and the third batch pilgrims have come here for medical checkup
 in yatriyon ko medical chekup main fitness milane ke baad 27 june ko nathu-laa ke liye ravaanaa kiya jayega
 Kamal Bansal, chairman of the Pilgrimage Development Committee in Delhi, is more concerned about the return of the two batches that China had left earlier
 pehle jatthe main 47 log hai or duusare jatthe main 44 log
 Both the batches of the Mansarovar Yatra have been returned by China from Nathu La Pass
 vaise iske peeche kaaran yah bataaya ja rahaa he ki tibet main maansarovar kii yatra ke raste main landslide hui he, lihaaja abhi yatra nahin karai ja sakati he
 According to Kamal Bansal, the pilgrims are currently kept in Gangtok
 sikkim tourism in logon kaa puraa khyaal rakh rahi he
 He also informed that in view of China's refusal, the Delhi government has requested the Ministry of External Affairs to intervene in the matter, but so far no specific information has come from the Ministry of External Affairs to the Pilgrimage Development Committee

 China's attitude has changed after this inauguration
 iske baad china ne nathu-laa ke jariye maansarovar yatra ke liye pehle se tay 8 jatthon kii anumati ko ghataakar mahaj 7 jatthon tak simiti kar di thi
 In such a situation, the return of the first two batches left for the Mansarovar Yatra through nathu-la is also being viewed with suspicion
 dilli main tirth yatra vikaas samiti ke chairman camel bansal kaa kahana he ki donon jatthon main gaye yatriyon ke rishtedaaron ke phone unako lagaataar aa rahe hai or wo unako sahi-sahi jawaab nahin de paa rahe hai
 On the other hand, the passengers of the third batch staying in Delhi for the Mansarovar Yatra say that there is a situation of disillusionment with regard to Kyatra
 bharat sarkaar ko is masale par jald hi pahal kerani chahie
 Passengers are hopeful that China will open its border to Mansarovar travelers and their wishes will be fulfilled

 These two companies will also increase the price of their vehicles next year

 Mercedes Benz vehicles in India cost between Rs 22 lakh and Rs 3 crore

 The third list of BJP has arrived
 teen liston main bijepi ab tak kul 371 ummidavaar ghoshit kar chuki he
 In the elections to be held in 403 assembly seats, now only 32 seats are yet to be announced
 teesri list saamne aane ke baad yah kaha ja rahaa he ki purvanchal main vahi hua jo bijepi saansad yogi adityanath chaahate the
 Yogi Adityanath has got whomever he wants
 teesri list main yogi haviapako bataa den ki list main gorakhpur gramin vidhansabha seat se vipin singh, chilloopar se rajesh treepathi or bansgaanv se bijepi saansad kamalesh paswan ke bhai vimalesh paswan ko tikat diya gaya he
 Apart from this, BJP has given ticket to Fateh Bahadur Singh from Campierganj, they all fall in the good list of Yogi
 iske alaava sahajanavaa seat se yogi ke khaas maane jane vaale sheethal pandeya ko tikat mila he
 While Mahendra Pal Singh Saithwar from Pipraich has managed to get tickets
 siem chehre ke taur par charchaa main rahe hai yogipichley kai maheenon se yogi adityanath ko bijepi kaa upi siem cheharaa banane kaa abhiyaan unke samarthak chalaa rahe hai
 Social media was also being used fiercely to garner public support for the sake of Hindu leader Yogi Adityanath
 abhi haal hi main gorakhpur main bijepi alpsankhyak morche ke kaaryakartaaon ne saansad yogi adityanath ko mukhyamantri banaae jane ko lekar gorakhnath mandir main khichdi bhi chadhaai thi
 However, the effort was not successful
 haalanki raajnneetik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki agar bijepi yogi ko bataur siem project karti to voton ke dhruvikaran kii sthiti main party ko kuch phayda ho saktaa he
 The BJP has not made Yogi the CM candidate but it is sure that his preference is being given to give priority to his choice in ticket distribution
 aapako bataa den ki yogi adityanath is baar kam se kam itnaa chaahate ki gorakhpur-basti mandal kii sabhi siton par unki raay agar na bhi lee jaae to kam se kam ek darjan siton par unke logon ko tikat diya jaae
 But, the bjp's top leadership wants them to campaign for all 65 seats in 11 districts of Gorakhpur region, not just the two mandals, but also ensure the victory of the party's candidates
 iske liye hindu yuva vahini ko bhi lagaaein or pehle kii bhaanti 2-4 siton par apane logon ko ladayen
 Significantly, Yogi Adityanath has also been appointed by the BJP as a star campaigner
 survey main chauthe number the yogiindia today or exis ne milakar upi main ek chunavi survey kiya tha
 The opinion of 8,480 people in the survey between 12 and 24 December was known in this survey
 survey ke mutabik mukhyamantri ke taur par matadaataaon kii pehali pasand akhilesh yadav the
 But as the CM, two BJP names were revealed in the top 5 faces
 bijepi netaaon main logon ko pehali pasand desh ke grahamantri or purv upi siem rajnath singh the jabaki tejatarraar hinduvadi netaa yogi adityanath duusare number par
 This was the percentage of choice Akhilesh Yadav- 33% Mayawati- 25% Rajnath Singh- 20% Yogi Adityanath- 18% Yogi is in Purvanchal Dabadbaguru Gorakshnath Peeth's Pithadishwar and MP Yogi Adityanath is the most prominent face of Hindutva in Purvanchal
 apni prakhar hinduvaadi chhavi ke liye vikhyath yogi bijepi se ajey saansad hai
 Apart from this, they also run their own parallel organization 'hindu Yuva Vahini'
 is sanghathan ke log bijepi ke prati nahin balki yogi adityanath ke prati samarpit hote hai
 This organization is quite active in Purvanchal due to which Yogi's political dominance in this area also remains
 2007 main yogi kii hindu yuva vahini ke the teen vidhayak2007 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi se tikat paane vaale hindu yuva vahini ke teen log chunaav jeetne main bhi safal hue the
 It included Shambhu Chaudhary from Naurangia seat of Kushinagar, Atul Singh from Ramkola and Vijay Bahadur Yadav from Gorakhpur Rural
 2012 ke chunaav main bhi yogi adityanath ko bijepi ne chaar seat di thi lekin chunaavon main gorakhpur gramin ke vijay bahadur yadav ke alaava sabko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 In the previous assembly it was a total of 403 seats in the figure assembly
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main samaajawaadee party ne 224 seat jitkar purna bahumat kii sarkaar banaai thi
 In the last elections, the BSP had got 80 seats, BJP 47, Congress 28, RLD 9 and others 24 seats
 sadaken vikaas kii dhamniyaan maani jaati hai
 That is why the central government had set a target of laying a network of roads there in 2009 to bring the Bastar, who is facing Maoist violence, out of its current situation
 vampanthi ugravad se prabhavit kshetron ke liye bani vishesh kaaryayojna mad ke tahat yahaan 23 sadaken teen saal main taiyaar ho jaani thim
 a total of more than 40,000 personnel of police and paramilitary forces are stationed here, but they too have not reduced the fear of Maoists
 yahi vajah he ki prastaavit sadakon main se ek bhi sadak aaj tak nahin ban pai he
 For the areas affected by Left Wing Extremism in the country, the Central Government had prepared an integrated action plan, in which roads were to be constructed in the affected areas as a priority
 samvedansheel ilaakon main kaam main ho rahi asuvidha ko dekhte hue pradhanmantri gramin sadak yojana ke tahat in sadakon ke liye alag se rakam manjuur kii gai thi
 In view of the particular risk in the affected areas, the contractors had filled tenders there more than the prevailing rates and the government had approved them
 yahaan 1,506 karod ru
 a total of 23 roads were to be built at a cost of 1,039 km
 isse laga tha ki mukhya dhara se kate bastar ke andruni ilaakon ko duusare kshetron se jodgaye kaa sarkaar kaa sapana puraa ho jayega
 But out of the 23 approved roads, no work has been completed so far
 inamen se 8 sadakon ke liye to thekedaar hi nahin mili hai
 At the same time, the work of three roads between modakpal-taralaguda, mariyagundam-chintalnar and Nelsanar, Kodoli and Gangalur in Bijapur district had to be canceled because Rs 215 crore
 main iskaa theka lene vaali mumbai kii messors niraj cement strectural limited kaam shuru hi nahin kar pai
 The rest of the roads are being run at a tortoise speed
 sadak nirmaan kaa pehla charan to puraa hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 On the other hand, the Public Works Department has selected those areas for the second phase, where the work can be completed easily and within the stipulated time frame
 vibhaag ke mukhya abhiyantaa e
 K
 mandhan kehete hai, ‘‘duusare charan ke liye nae sire se sadakon kaa chayan kar centre sarkaar ko manjuuri ke liye bheja he
 The length of the roads is 448 km and the cost of construction is Rs 800 crore
 hogi
 "maximum five roads are proposed in Bastar district, three in narayanpur-kondagaon, two in Sukma and one each in Dantewada, Bijapur and Kanker
" is yojana main sukama-dantewada ke bich kareeb 69 kimi rajya rajmarg kaa nirmaan bhi nae sire se kiya janaa he
 The reason for not getting a contractor for road construction is the apathy of the administration besides the Maoists
 darasal maowad prabhavit ilaakon main sadak nirmaan main lage vaahanon or mashiinon main todfod or aagjanee kaa jokhim hameshaa bana rahata he
 Reason: The Maoists do not want to let the development work reach its end
 lekin aise maamalon main nuksaan kii evaj main prashasan kii ore se behad maamuli muaavja diya jaataa he
 The latest case is the construction of the katekalyan-dantewada road
 isi saal 5 farvari ko pondum ke kareeb maovadiyon ne hamalaa kar sadak nirmaan main lagi do tippar, wibro roller ko aag ke hawaale kar diya
 The Poklen machine was also damaged
 isse thekedaar ko kareeb 40 lakh ru
 There was a loss of Rs
 kii muaavja raashi manjuur kii
 Says a contractor, "the risk of having adequate insurance cover of vehicles and machines or working only on the guarantee of administration can be taken, but in such cases there seems to be a lack of willpower in the administration
 ’’thekedaaron kii ek dikkat yah bhi he ki unhen kaam sthaneey shramikon se hi lenaa hota he, jo police kii suraksha main kaam nahin karnaa chaahate
 So despite being a risk, fraudsters do not take protection
 isse bhi maovadi vaaradaaten bad rahi hai
 Bijapur Superintendent of Police Prashant Agarwal says, "for every construction work, security is given at the behest of the contractor
 ’’ lekin mandhan ke mutabik police suraksha muhaiyaa karwaae jane ke baavjood thekedaar kaam shuru nahin karte hai

While we know how healthy Indian food is, where we often go wrong with is our over-indulgence in fried Indian snacks
 These are usually consumed after 6 pm and result in bulging tummies and high fat percentages
 This is the first step towards all kinds of lifestyle issues like diabetes, thyroid, obesity, pcod etc
 This is part of your diet where you have to work

 Through these cooperative banks, paddy is procured for PDS system of the country

 To participate, the Ministry of Home Affairs, withholding the information, cited Sections 8 (1) (a), (g) and (I) of the RTI Act, which provides exemption for not issuing three types of information

 On December 4, we celebrated the 100th birth anniversary of former Prime Minister and two-time foreign minister Indra Kumar Gujarat
 vahi gujral jinhone in jatiltaaon ko bhalee-bhaanti samajhate hue, sitambar, 1996 main pehali baar ek sthaneey niti banaai thi jiskaa uddeshy tha bharat kii chhavi ko ek kshetreey adhinaayak se badalakar ek udaar desh kii chhavi bananaa jo padosiyon se bina koi khaas apeksha rakhe, unhen saath lekar chalane kii ichha rakhata ho
 This is called the Gujral theory in which the five core principles were outlined
 pehla, nepal, bangladesh, maldive or srilanka ke saath bharat pratifal kii aashaa nahin rakhega par sadbhaav or vishwaas banane ko apni taraf se jo bhi sambhav ho, karne ko tatpar rahegaa

 The first principle was a very different idea from traditional diplomatic thinking
 is tarah ke siddhant pasandida ranneeti ko darshaate hai vah bhi safalataa ke aashwaasan ke bina kyonki vah to chote padosiyon par nirbhar karegaa ki ve in siddhanton kaa kitna paalan karte hai
 Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir was at its peak in the 1990s
 aise main yah ummid karnaa bemaani tha ki vah gujral siddhant ke mul tatwon kaa sammaan karegaa
 Nevertheless, in June 1996, the then Prime Minister Gujral approved a Foreign Secretary level meeting in which the seeds of the composite dialogue were sown
 haalanki, vaarta benatija rahi kyonki gujral ne kashmir par ek alag kaary samooh ke nirmaan kii maang ko thukraa diya
 The Composite Dialogue started later but broke down which stated that any doctrine of peaceful relations with Pakistan behaving in a friendly manner with India has its limits
 aaj, samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ko khatm kar die jane or purvavarti jammu-kashmir rajya ke nakshe ko phir se paribhaashit karne ke saath kashmir par pakistan ke saath kisi bhi dwipaksheeya vaarta ke mul siddhant puri tarah badal gaye hai
 The Ganga water treaty of December 1996 with Bangladesh was a major achievement of the Gujral doctrine
 antarrashtriya dabaav ke baavjood gujral ne aktubar, 1996 main vyapak pareekshan pratibandh sandhi (sitibiti) par hastakshar karne se dridhtaa se inkaar kar diya
 With courage, he told India Today that India would neither surrender its nuclear option, nor was it afraid of being isolated
 gujral ne kaha tha ki ''inasaanon kii tarah jo raashtra ghutane tech dete hai yaa jhukate rahete hai, unka kabhi sammaan nahin hota
 He cited the threat of China and the help given to Pakistan, and described the CTBT as friendly to nuclear-weapon states
 kahiraa main meri ore se yojit ek baithak main gujral kii tippanee aaj bhi yaad aati he
 Rejecting Britain's proposals for arbitration over Kashmir, Gujral remarked, "the illusion of the grandeur of the colonial past remains in Britain's mind so far
" isane bharat ko vibhajit karte samay kashmir kii samasya khadi kii
 Now it wants to give us a solution
 '' yah baat maharani elizabeth kii bharat kii rajkeey yatra se thik pehle kii he
 Britain's constantly declining status in the midst of the current Brexit crisis reminds Gujral of that assessment

 However, till date only two girls have been able to steal his heart
 ji haa, skool ke dinon main siddharth kii ek garlfriend hua karti thi jiske liye wo kaaphi syrius bhi the
 But as is the case with most long-distance relationships, Siddharth had a break-up after coming to Mumbai

 itnaa hi nahin rajya ke 107 tehsil gahare sookhe sankat se jujh rahe hai jabaki 49 tahseelon main sookhe kaa asar thodaa kam he

 What Happens Artificial Rain (cloud Seeding) Artificial clouds are made before silver iodide and dry ice to make artificial rain (cloud seeding)
 iske baad jab suraj kii garmi se hawa garm hokar halki ho jaati he or upar kii taraf uthne lagati he to hawa kaa dabaav kam ho jaataa he
 This air cools after reaching a height in the sky, after which the density in the air increases
 boonden itani badi ho jaati hai ki wo zyada der tak hawa main lataki nahin rah sakati jiske baad barish kii buundon ke rup main neeche girane lagati he
 Cloud seeding was first used in Australia in February 1947
 bijli, pani or mahangaai se saal bhar jujhate dilliwaalon ko ab dilli main jurm ke aankade daraa rahe hai
 As the years go by, Delhi people have been given that dreadful figure which they cannot believe after seeing and hearing that it is the capital of the country
 saal bhar main dilli main 100 fisadi jurm bad gaya
 More than 2000 rapes, more than 550 murders, more than 6000 loot
 ye aankade hamaare nahin hai
 Rather, with the calculation of last year's crime, the Delhi Police has informed the media on Friday itself
 1 janvari se 15 disambar 2014 tak dilli main hue aparaadhon main 561 murder, 2069 rape, 1282 chhedhkaani ke maamle, 6180 lut ke maamle or 6944 raah chalate jhapatmari ke maamle shaamil hai
 This is the Delhi of Takwar people
 desh kaa darbar yaheen lagata he
 The people who run the country live here and the credit of the country's smartest police force is also near this city
 2069 rape16 disambar 2012 hua to apni isi smart police force ne dilliwaalon ko dilasa diya ki mahilaon kii izzat ke hifaazat ke liye puri takat jhonk denge
 But then will not let anyone else become fearless
 jis saal nirbhaya ne rulaayaa tha us saal dilli main 706 nirbhaya kii asmat gai thi
 i do not know what the Delhi Police had comforted that in 2013, the number of rapes reached 1636 directly from 706
 sochaa chalo vakt lagata hai chizon ko sanbhaalane main
 Will be careful
 par galat sochaa
 Because in 201414 all the records were broken
 rape kaa aankada 2069 ja pahunchaa
 That is, there are an average of 5 to 6 rape cases in Delhi every day
 561 murderdilli main katl kii har vaardaat ke baad kuch aisa hi manzar hota he
 Impaired death breaks families
 dilli police ne vaada kiya tha ki wo in maatami chikhon ko bhi control karegi
 But what happened? In 2013, Delhi saw the blood of 486 people
 14 main ye aankada 561 ja pahunchaa
 This is a hallmark
 varna ek sadak haadasa chhod den to dakaiti, lut, chhedhkhani
 Pounce, theft, vehicle theft, just remember the names of the crime; ipissi ke jurmon kii jo list he us list har chiz badi he
 Overall, the crime graph in Delhi has increased by 183 per cent in 14 years compared to 14
 kyon bad rahaa aparaadh?ab sawaal ye he ki aakhir dilli main jurm kaa graph bad kyon rahaa he? kya dilli police apni duty karne main naakaam rahi he? kya mujarimon ke dilon se dilli police kaa khauf jaataa rahaa he? kya dilli kii badhati aabaadi krime ke badhate graph ke liye jimmedaar he? yaa phir free registration yani har maamle main eemaandaaree se exiaar darj karne ke chalate aisa hua he?dilli ke kamishnar bassi kehete hai ki isaki vajah ye he ki police ab eemaandaaree se exias darj karti he isiilie aankade bad gaye
 But the question is that when the crime is committed, then the FIR is registered
 phir kya ye daleel bachakaani nahin he?fir darj karne main eemaandaaree se bade aankade?khamkha ham sab pichley do saal se dilli police ko lekar cheekh rahe the
 Were crying their shortcomings
 unki kahili par gussa jataa rahe the
 Whereas the commissioner said the truth today
 ek aisa sach jo kisi kii bhi ankhen khol de
 The truth is that the graph of crimes against women in Delhi has increased because the police now register such cases honestly
 yani dilli main rape, murder yaa chhedhkhani ke maamle police ke nikammepan kii vajah se nahin bade
 Nor is there any fault of the police in this
 khami to un darindon kii he jo rape or murder karte hai
 Where is the fault in the police? wo to rape ke baad eemaandaaree se exias darj karti he
 But commissioner sir
 bas itnaa bataa dijie ki aapaki police kaa kaam kya sirf exias darj karnaa bhar he? agar sirf exiaar ke aankadon kii vajah se dilli main rape yaa baaki jurm bad rahe hai to to phir aapaki itani baari-bharkam police force kaa kya kaam? kyon he ye police? kis kaam ke liye he? darinde darindagi dikhaaen or police unki darindagi kii bas report likhti rahe? kya police kaa kaam krime rokna nahin he? kya police kaa kaam rape rokna nahin he?aap hi kah rahe hai jurm ke aankade free registration kii vajah se bad rahe hai
 So are fiis written like this? Obviously, FIA is registered only when there is a crime
 agar aapaki police jurm hone se pehle hi use roak de to exias likhane kii naubat hi kahaan aegi? or vaise bhi police kaa kaam jurm rokna he naa ki ye kah kar apana pallaa jhaadna ki ham eemaandaaree se exiaar darj karte hai isliye krime ke aankade bad rahe hai
 The increase in hundred percent crime in a year is a matter of concern for any city and people living in that city, Commissioner

 adwani ne apane blog par is bare main likhaa he
 According to the BJP leader, 'when 2011 started, i said that the year was a year of scams and scandals
 vaastaviktaa main, loksabhaa ke sheetakaaleen satr ke pehle din, bhaajapa ke netritv main puure vipaksh ne mukhya taur par teen ghotaalon, rashtramandal, 2 ji or mumbai ke raksha bhoomi ghotaale ko uthaane kaa faisla kiya tha
 'he wrote,' If the opposition had a chance to speak on the opening day itself, then the deadlock that lasted for the rest of the day and the entire session would not have come
 ’ adwani ne likhaa, ‘vipaksh kii naaraazgi isliye zyada rahi kyonki jab vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne bolnaa shuru kiya to puure satta paksh ne unhen bolne hi nahin diya
 According to Advani, after this all the opposition parties came to the conclusion that till the government is ready to form JPC to investigate these scams, there will be no work in Parliament
 adwani ne likhaa he ki is gatirodh ko dur karne ke liye sarkaar or loksabhaa adhyaksh ne bahut si baithken kin, lekin is mudde ko suljhaayaa nahin ja sakaa
 He wrote about the upcoming budget session, "now, when the budget session is about to begin, the government is holding constant meetings with the opposition and the government feels that the right step for it is to create a JPC under these circumstances

 ’ Whether this year's 'my Needs Is Khan' and 'housefull' or last year's 'three Idiots' and 'wanted', the similarity in all these films is that their titles are based on English words
 is shuukravaar ko relies hui rithik roshan abhinit bahupratikshit ‘kits’ bhi aisa hi udhaaharan he jiskaa film samikshakon ke saath darshakon ko besabri se intjaar tha
 Since January 2010, 59 Hindi films of Bollywood have been released, of which 34 films are on the English title
 vaise varsh 2009 main bhi 84 filmon main se 50 filmon ke naam angreji ke the
 In the last few years too, there is a long list of Hindi films with English titles
 jahaan 2008 main ‘singh ij king’, ‘res’ or ‘fishan’ jaisi filmon ne baks aphis par khub dhooma machaai thi to usee tarah 2007 main bhi ‘welcome’, ‘chak de india’ ‘he baby’ or ‘partner’ ne bhi jamkar kamai kii
 Film critic Jyoti Venkatesh says that 'global Approach' is the reason for the growing English titles in Bollywood films and these films benefit when released in the country as well as abroad because the focus of producer and director is 'targale Viewer' Happens on
 venkatesh ne kaha, ‘ye (angreji tital) global aprope kaa ek badhiya udhaaharan he
 People understand if such films are released in Odisha or Tamil Nadu also
 iske saath baliwood filmein ab videshon main bhi relies hone lagi hai
 In addition to 'kites' in the coming days, many films with English titles like 'once Upon a Time in Mumbai' and 'no One Killed Jessica' are in the queue which Bollywood has high hopes for
 is film sameekshak ne kaha, ‘nirmaataaon kaa ‘target vyler’ par bhi dhyaan hota he kyonki ek samay film paanch hajaar main ban jaati thi or ab 50-60 karod main banati he
 In this context, it is better that instead of difficult Hindi, the title of the film should be a colloquial one, even if it is based on English
 ’ ‘striker’, ‘rhite yaa rong’ or ‘lav, sex or dhokhaa’ jaisi kai anya filmein bhi isi saal aayin or buree tarah flop raheen
 This means that one thing is clear that English titles are not a guarantee of success
 venkatesh ne kaha, ‘keval angreji tital hit hone kii guarantee nahin hai, film kaa content (saamagree) sabase badi cheez he
 However, people still consider it as a hit formula
 ’ lekin sawaal he ki bollywood filmon main angreji ke badhate dabadabe ke liye kya hindi khud bhi jimmedaar he
 Dr
 Roop Krishna Bhatt, Principal and Linguist of Northern Regional Language Center, says that Hindi is also responsible for the increasing level of English in the medium of communication because Hindi vocabulary is very difficult in many cases, so people often use difficult Hindi words And avoid using English words
 bhatta ne kaha, ‘hindi kii shabdaawalee kai vishyon par angreji ke mukaable kathin he
 Because of this, people start using English words in common parlance
 saath hi media bhi is maamle main ahm bhoomika nibhaataa he
 'these linguists welcome the use of words in other languages in Hindi, but they say that this should not affect the culture
 unhone kaha, ‘koi bhashaa buree nahin hoti he
 Similarly, there is no harm in using some words of English but their culture cannot be adopted

 He claimed in his petition that Abdul Rahman, an accused and former police inspector who allegedly fired at Sheikh, threatened him that he would be implicated in a false case if he opened his mouth

 The court will decide both the petitions on Friday
 (input bhashaa se) The Narendra Modi government is currently undergoing a rigorous examination of its political prowess
 satta sanbhaalane ke baad jab ahm faislon kii baari ai to bijepi ne paaya ki in faislon or vipakshi dal ke rup main kii gai ghoshnaaon main talmail bitha paanaa mushkil he
 Especially when he has to suffer the wrath of the Supreme Court
 sarkaar dhadadhad kai aarthik faislon ke jariye apane nirnaayak iraadon kaa sanket dena chaahati thi lekin use yakaayak thahar janaa padaa
 That was the only decisive decision to build defense
 bhitari sutron ke mutabik, mote taur par nirdesh yah tha ki adnga daalane vaale kisi jhamele main pade bagaiyr kaam shuru karo
 The result was that instead of taking decisions with fearlessness, caution was taken and nuances hung the decisions
 koyalah ab bhi adhar main atkane koyala adhyadesh ke adhyay 3 kii dhara 12 main isi se sambandhit do or praavdhaan jude hai
 According to them, after this new law, the Central Government is committed to provide compensation or compensation to those who give loans to the mine owners who have lost the allocation of coal blocks
 isamen yah bhi saaf-saaf likhaa he ki muaavje ke niyam baad main tay kiye jaaenge
 Forget the other things
 khud sarkari afasar maanate hai ki yahi apane aap main bahut baari-bharkam kaam hoga
 a huge bureaucratic structure has to be erected under the umbrella of a retired civil officer to negotiate the compensation amount
 phir aise samjhauton ke atirikt kanoonee pachadon main funs jane kii ashanka bhi he
 This may cause the new bidders to retreat fearfully
 lihaaja tay samay simaaon kaa paalan karnaa mushkil hoga
 The government claims that it is trying to do better in the most difficult situation arising out of the cancellation of 214 allocation of coal mines from the Supreme Court
 lekin supreme court ne apane faisle ko sahi tehraaya he
 For this, he used the argument of Attorney General (AG) Mukul Rohatgi in his September 24 order
 agi ne sarkaar kii taraf se kaha tha ki vah sabhi kol blokon kaa aavanton radd karne ke faisle ko maanane ke liye taiyaar he
 The court has mentioned this in its order
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or vitt mantri arun jetali ne aksar apane is vaade ko doharaaya he ki sarkaar koyala kshetra main sudhaaron kii shuruyaat karne ke liye is maukey kaa istemaal karegi
 In this context, the ordinance has opened the way to the technical possibility of allowing private companies to commercially exploit mines
 iske tahat unhen koyale ke kisi nishchit antim upyog kii bandish se mukt kiya ja sakegaa
 But the Finance Minister has postponed the decision for later
 yah is baat kaa sanket he ki unhen majdoor unionon kii taraf se daale ja sakane vaale dabaav kaa ehsaas he
 Especially when the rss-linked Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh is the largest labor organization in the region
 gas kii keemtah ulate raste pararajanatik makasad tha ki gas kii keemat 8
 Finding a way to get less than $ 4 per MBTU
 yah keemat upie sarkaar ne rangarajan formule ke jariye tay kii thi
 This formula was based on the average of gas prices in different regions around the world
 isamen vah keemat bhi shaamil thi jo bharat kii pramukh gas aayaat company petronet alenji videshon se prakritik gas kharidne ke liye chukaati he
 Petronet is a unique government undertaking created with the stated objective of importing gas
 saarvajanik kshetra kii sabhi badi tel companiyon kii hissedari ke saath iskaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 But their total share could not exceed 50 per cent
 is tarah yah puri tarah sarkaar ke swaamitv vaali company nahin thi or sarkaar ke vittiya niyam-kaayadon kii bandishon se ise baahar rakhaa ja saktaa tha
 Despite this, the Petroleum Secretary could have been its chairman because of the highest share
 petronet ne katar se kareeb 13 dollar prati embitiu kii dar se gas aayaat karne kaa sauda kiya hua he
 This price was also included in the Rangarajan formula designed to calculate the new price of gas generated within the country
 ab yah keemat is formule se nikaal di gai he
 With this, Japan's fixed price for Asian countries was also removed
 aisa isliye kiya gaya he taaki kul keemat ko ghataakar 5
 Can be brought up to $ 6 per MBTU
 iske liye daleel yah di gai ki gharelu utpaadak gharelu keemat ko kritrim rup se badhaane ke liye gas kaa aayaat kar sakate hai
 But what was not mentioned is that at present no domestic company imports gas for sale
 duusari ore, petronet gharelu utpaadan ke kaam main shaamil nahin he
 The important thing was to give maximum impetus to accelerate domestic gas production
 desh kii urja jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye yah bahut jaruri he
 Further exploration of gas can also reduce prices in future
 america main aisa hi hua tha
 The discovery of the shell there caused prices to dramatically drop from $ 13 per MBTU to $ 4 per MBTU
 duusari ore china main keemten 10-12 dollar prati embitiu ke daayre main bani hui hai
 These are market based prices
 sarkaar bazaar daron par aadhaarit formule ke or kareeb ja sakati thi
 But to avoid political misdeeds, she pulled back, UPA lagged behind where she stood
 parinaam yah hua ki gharelu utpaadan main nivesh ko khaas protsaahan nahin diya gaya
 There was also a fear that producers should not consider imports as a better option because the price has to be paid by the consumer eventually
 pratirakshah sahi disha main kadam2007 main faisla liya janaa tha ki kya nijee companiyon ko pandubbiyaan banane di jaaen

 With this, the government ended the debate which could never be completed under the UPA rule because then the Prime Minister's Office used to pull in one direction, the Ministry of Defense in the other direction

 This is an area which was untouched by any form of reforms under the UPA rule
 ab pariksha aise faisle lene main he jo party ke rukh ke khilaaf jate hai
 For example, the government has to decide whether it wants to abide by important two-way agreements with other countries or to renegotiate these agreements to fulfill the party's mission of bringing back India's wealth stashed abroad

 As BJP leader Narendra Modi was on his way to become the next Prime Minister of India, there was an uproar in neighboring Pakistan
 pakistani raksha mantralay ne sarkaar ne maang kii ki uskaa bajet badhaayaa jaae
 At the same time, Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif has chaired a high level meeting of security officials
 pakistani sainya balon ke liye bajet main ijaphe kii maang kii gai he jisase nae hathiyaar kharide ja saken
 The increase in budget has been demanded for the new budget in June
 pakistani raksha mantralay main atirikt sachiv air vaayas marshall arshad kudus ne kaha ki nae hathiyaaron kii kharid ke liye adhik paise kii jarurat he
 He said that about 43 per cent of the defense budget is for staff related expenses, while 26 per cent is for operations and 10 per cent for civil works
 baaki 21 fisadi upkarnon kii servicing or rakrakhaav par kharch hota he
 The 'timing' of the Pakistan Defense Ministry's demand for an increase in the budget is interesting as the relationship between rival India and Pakistan has looked sour and sweet at times
 gauratlab he ki pichley dinon pakistan ke grih mantri choudhary nisaar khan ne kaha tha kiagar narendra modi bharat ke pradhanmantribanate hai to isse kshetreey shanti ke liye khatra paidaa ho jayega

 lekin sawaal he ki mamata ise apni jeet kaise bataa rahi hai, kyonki supreme court ne kaha he ki police kamishnar ko har samay sibiai ko jaanch main sahyog karnaa he
 The Chief Secretary, Director General of Police and the Commissioner of Police have been given notice in the matter of contempt

 mantralay kaa kahana he ki neshnal hive ke kisi bhi project ke liye enechaeai bhoomi adhigrahan nahin karti he

 Why should we face so much pressure? i want to be a scientist in the future and want to see my parents happy

 In Rajasthan, the Congress reached the pinnacle of power, when the BJP was in power in Rajasthan, it took the command of the state president, then brought the Congress to the pinnacle of power, but lost out on the race for the post of Chief Minister by one vote

 He is an MP from Bhilwara, who keeps his holiday on saturday-sunday exclusively for the people of the parliamentary constituency

 That loss of one vote still haunts Joshi's heart, so now he is showing his stamina in the politics of the Center to fulfill his dream of the Chief Minister's post

 Modi himself has put the sword of the land acquisition bill related to the farmers in the hands of the opposition and now the messiahship of the farmers has started to feed Rahul's politics

 First he traveled in the general coach of the train and reached Asia's largest grain market located in Tehsil Khanna in Ludhiana district
 patrakaron se baat karte hue unhone sarkaar par tikhe hamale kiye
 He directly blamed the central government for not raising the wheat of the farmer, but also said that compensation was not given to the farmers for the crops which were damaged due to the incessant rains and hail
 unhone kaha ke sarkaar kahaan hai yah kisi ko nahin pataa
 He described the present government as the government of some capitalists
 unke mutabik sarkaar puunjipatiyon ke haath main khel rahi he or garib kisaanon kii zamin chin kar unheen puunjipatiyon ko de dena chaahati he lekin congress party ye kisi bhi keemat par nahin hone degi or kisaanon kii jameen kisaanon ke paas hi rahegi

 philhal teen round kii boli ho chuki he

 The bar has been scolded
 haal hi main court ne sarkaar se talkh lahaze main poocha tha ki vah simit spectrum kii nilaamee kyon kar rahi he
 Why the entire spectrum is not being auctioned

 Actor Kamal Haasan has entered politics and wants to see his own government in Tamil Nadu, but why did he think of forming his new party? Why did they not join DMK or AIADMK? Kamal Haasan gave a very interesting answer when Padmaja Joshi asked him this question at the ongoing India Today Conclave in Mumbai
 camel hasan ne kaha- main bhookha hum
 
 
 And what is available is rotten fruit
 unka ishaara DMK or AIADMK kii taraf tha
 He was asked whether he was against DMK or AIADMK? On this, he did not give a straight answer, saying - i am against foolish and mediocre politics
 camel hasan makkal nidhi mayyam party ke sansthaapak hai
 This party is neither a supporter of the ideology of the right wing nor of the left
 tamil main mayyam kaa matlab hota he- centre
 The third option he told his own party: Haasan said, 'I have completed my time in films
 main ek nai jindagi kii shuruyaat ke liye taiyaar hum
 This is a life that i have been denying for many years
 ' unhone bataaya, pehle wo sansadeey raajnneeti ko apane liye sahi nahin maanate the, lekin ab iske bina aap logon kii seva nahin kar sakate hai
 The purpose of joining politics is to serve the people
 unhone kaha, wo raajnneeti main kisi star kii tarah nahin balki ek kaaman main kii tarah aae hai
 Kamal Haasan described his own party as the third option in Tamil Nadu
 diemke or eidiemke jaisi partiyon main nahin jane ke sawaal par camel ne kaha, main bahut bhookha hum or mere saamne sada hua fal he to nahin khaauungaa
 What they were (parties) does not matter, but what they are now, it is very important to me
 vijayan-kejariwal achche netaatmam netaaon se mulaaqaat or bhavishya main kisi party se gathbandhan ke sawaal par camel hasan ne kaha, 'ye vichaardhaara kaa maamla he
 i am definitely looking into it, but i have not made any definite decision yet
 left netaa vijayan or kejariwal se mulaakaat or gathbandhan ke sawaal par kaha- vijayan ne kerala ko nai oonchaaiyon tak pahunchaaya
 i like Vijayan and Kejriwal
 unhone kaha, wo andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu se bhi milenge
 No party and no name is bad
 vichaardhaara or plan do alag-alag chijen hai
 On the expansion of politics outside Tamil Nadu, let's first see what we (in Tamil Nadu) achieve
 raajnneeti main chuaachhut nahin maanata, par vichaar se samjhauta nahingathbandhan ke sawaal par camel hasan ne yah bhi kaha, main chuaachhut kii raajnneeti main bharosa nahin karata
 But i will not compromise with corrupt politics and criminal tendencies
 raajnneeti ke liye koi samjhauta nahin kar saktaa
 For me losing elections is not a big thing, but compromising ideology is a big loss
 samaan vichaardhaara ke logon ke saath aane main dikkat nahin he
 When Padmaja Joshi asked Kamal Haasan that the people of DMK and AIADMK would be listening to you, what would you like them to say? Haasan replied - Go improve

 iske alaava sabhi dalit alpsankhyakon ko anusuchit jati kaa darja dene se dalit muslim or isai bhi isamen shaamil ho jaaenge

 subramanyan or felman ne ek paper likhaa he
 Both teach at Harvard University
 arvind ne maujuuda aarthik halaat ko mahasusti (great Slowdown) kaha he
 He says that this is not a normal recession
 ise samajhane ke liye unhone bataaya he ki kis tarah se bharat par pehle se bainkon ke lone kaa sankat bad rahaa tha lekin notebandi ke baad ek or sankat paidaa hota he jo use neeche kii ore dhakel chukaa he
 During 2004 to 2011, the steel sector, power sector and infra sector were given a number of loans which later became non-performing assets
 jinhen bed lone kaha jaataa he
 After demonetisation, private sector loans continue to grow
 jiske kaaran bainkon par doharaa boj pad gaya he
 Non-banking finance companies like NBFC such as IL&FS were ruined after demonetisation
 notebandi ke baad bahut sara cash bainkon main pahunchaa
 Banks started lending to IL&FS
 IL&FS jaisi companiyon ne real state ko lone dena shuru kar diya
 And what happened in real estate? Because people did not have the money to buy flats, the flats did not sell
 june 2019 tak 8 shaharon main das lakh flats bina bike hue hai
 Their value is said to be 8 lakh crores
 chaar saal main itane flats bikate hai
 But there is no sale
 lihaaza real state ko diya hua lone doobane laga
 NBFC has given loans of 5 lakh crores to real estate
 aadha paisa bed lone ho chukaa he
 That is, drowned
 zaahir he iskaa bhaar bainkon par padegaa
 The banks that were about to recover are now sinking further
 to unhone NBFC ko lone dena band kar diya
 From which small and medium industries used to take loans
 unhen paisa milanaa band ho gaya
 In the first six months of this year, banks gave almost no loan
 lihaaza arthvyavastha kii gaadi ruuk gai
 Arvind and Feldman say that India faced a severe crisis in 1991
 sarkaar ke paas paise nahin the
 This time the crisis is deeper than that
 arthvyavastha ai si you main pahunch gai he
 One of the punishments of this crisis is the account holders of Punjab Maharashtra Corporation Bank
 ve abhi bhi sadakon par hai lekin ab sab bhul chuke hai
 Their money is sunk
 jab aapkaa bhi dubegaa to aise hi log chup rahenge jaise aaj aap chup hai
 India's exports have dropped from August to November
 chamada, jawaharaat, radimaid garment
 All exports are in the negative
 zaahir he iskaa asar kam kamai vaale karmchaariyon par padaa hoga
 Their jobs must be leaving
 isi tabko ko uljhaae rakhane ke liye hindu muslim kaa agenda thela ja rahaa he
 Because this topic really confuses people
 log ghanton bahes karte hai
 The whole day goes away
 yahi nahin aayaat bhi ghatane laga he
 In this way a cycle of collapse has been created
 iskaa parinaam jiesti sangrah par padaa he
 The central government is unable to give the dues to the states
 kanoon he ki agar rajyon kaa kar sangrah 14 pratishat kii dar se nahin badhegaa to jitna nahin badhegaa utane kaa bhugtan centre sarkaar karegi
 In this way, the state government has owed Rs 50,000 crore
 yah paisa rajyon main nahin pahonchega to unki gaadi kii raftaar dhimi hogi
 States are asking for their share
 kah rahe hai ki supreme court jaaenge
 Or come out at the GST Council meeting
 sarkaar duusari taraf jiesti badhaane ke liye dekh rahi he ki vah kin chizon kii jiesti daren badha sakati he
 What are the changes in the slab of GST rates? isi bich sarkaar ne halke se 21 dawaaon ke daam 50 pratishat tak badha die hai
 You know that even 15 percent of India's urban and rural population does not come under the purview of health insurance
 aage bataane kii zarurat nahin ki har parivaar apni kamai kaa 10 se 25 pratishat swasthya par kharch kar rahaa he
 Due to which, if he is poor, he goes below the poverty line and if he is middle class, then he falls on the poverty line
 sarkaar ke paas paise nahin he
 Obviously the government will sell its resources
 power sector main bhi yahi ho rahaa he
 The same is happening in the petroleum sector
 power sector ke 15 lakh karmchaaree ab jaage hai
 Till now he was busy with the spread agenda of TV
 aaj bhi zyaadaatar hindu muslim dibet main jitna hissaa lete honge uskaa aadha bhi aarthik nitiyon par nahin khapate honge
 Well, now when they go on strike on 8 January, they will see that even after 15 lakh, their price has come down to zero
 main kai baar kah chukaa hum
 India's democracy has changed
 yah ab sankhya kaa koi mahatv nahin rahaa
 Every number is rejected by another large group
 desh ke pradhanmantri pradarshnakariyon ke kapade kii taraf ishaar karte hai
 This is obviously their intention
 afko galat bhi nahin lagegaa kyonki pradhanmantri kaa to vikalp nahin he
 But if the conscience had survived, he would have easily understood the meaning of his statement given in the Jharkhand elections
 sidhe naam na lo magar ishaare ishaare main logon ke us khyaal ko bada karo jo unhen hindu muslim dibet kaa darshak banaati he
 Manufactures consumer
 samarthak banaati he
 Makes the citizen a rooster
 naagarik khatm ho jaataa he
 The leader fries the rooster and eats it

 It would be a miracle for the team to reach the semi-finals
 rashtriya coach harendra singh ne team ke liye antim chaar main pahunchane kaa praarambhik lakshya rakhaa he lekin purv diggajon kaa kahana he ki ise hasil kar paanaa tedhi kheer hoga
 The focus of Hockey India is on the ongoing tussle for the election on January 29, while the players boycotted the camp in Pune due to non-payment
 chak de india fame purv khilaadi miraranjan negi ne kaha ki hockey india main itani gandi raajnneeti ho rahi he ki team aise maahaul main bhi agar vishwa cap ke semifinal tak pahunchati he to yah kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin hoga
 He said, 'we are not getting any benefit from being hosts
 maidan taiyaar nahin he or bhugtan ke abhaav main khilaadi taiyaariyon par dhyaan nahin de paa rahe
 He said that the morale of the team has dropped and the winning attitude is not visible in it
 saath hi unhone vishwa cap jaise bade toornament ko sanjidagi se nahin liye jane kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 At the same time, Olympian Aslam Sher Khan, former chairman of the ad hoc selection committee of IOA, said that how will that team reach the final four, which is not going to ask
 asalam ne kaha, ‘aisa lagata he ki hockey india ko team ke pradarshan se nahin balki chunaav main satta hasil karne se adhik matlab he
 His goal is to occupy positions, not medals
 aise maahaul main vishwa cap main team se achche pradarshan kii ummid karnaa bemaani he
 He said, "if the command was handed in the right hands at the time of the formation of Hockey India, it could have been a turning point for Indian hockey, but the ruling people are lacking in intent
 unhen naa khel se matlab he or naa hi khilaadiyon se
 'former Olympian Pargat Singh said that players are facing the consequences of Hockey India
 unhone kaha, ‘hockey india 29 janvari ko hone vaale chunaav ke sameekaran apane anukool banane main masaroof he
 In the matter of giving recognition to the regional units, it is arbitrary and in all the fuss, World Cup and team preparations have been marginalized
 ’ pargat ne kaha ki nishchit taur par iskaa asar taiyaariyon par padegaa
 He said that Hockey India should focus on preparing for the World Cup by completing the election formalities quickly under the rules
 negi ne yah bhi kaha ki haaki india ke galat faislon kii vajah se hi team ko behtareen coach bhi nahin mil sakaa
 He said, 'jose Brasa is not one of the best coaches in the world but his arrival has made a difference
 aise main yadi hamaare paas rik charlsworth jaisaa koi umdaa coach hota to bharat sheersh tiimon main shumaar ho saktaa tha lekin haaki ke hukmaranon ne isaki sud nahin lee
 Former Olympian and coach Baljit Singh Saini said that the cancellation of the tournament of four countries before the World Cup starting on February 28 was a big blow as India has not yet made its assessment against the big teams
 unhone kaha, ‘kamjor tiimon ko raundne se taiyaariyon kaa pataa nahin chalata
 We should have played with teams like Holland or Australia but the tournament of four countries got canceled which is a big setback for the preparations
 ’ hockey india kaa kahana he ki ex se anumati nahin milane ke kaaran yah toornament radd karnaa padaa jabaki ex pich taiyaar nahin hone kii duhai de rahaa he
 Indian coaches have asked for the National Stadium for practice since late January, but they are not expected to be ready before February, so the Indian team does not seem to get much benefit from being the hosts in this hockey season

 Modi government's second budget is coming
 pehle bajet main us sarkaar kii zyada nahin chali thi lekin ab use kaaphi vakt mila he or usne ambajattaiyaar kar liya he jo ab chapai ke daur main he
 People from every section of society have high hopes from this budget, but the most employed class has it
 naukareepesha varg ko pichley saalon kii mahangaai ne bahut chot pahunchaai or oonchi byaaj daron ne rahi-sahi kasar puri kar di
 Children's school fees, increased transport expenses and medical bills disrupted her peace
 ab vah intazaar kar rahaa he ki use raahak mili
 Let us see which 10 kinds of relief they are expecting from this budget: 1
 inakam tex main chhot-inakam tex main chhot har koi chaah rahaa he or naukareepesha varg chahta he ki ise badhaakar teen lakh rupye prati varsh kar diya jaae
 He also wants the tax slab to change as well
 vah yah bhi chahta he ki bachat yojanaon par nivesh kii seemaa badha di jaae jo abhi dedh lakh rupye tak hi he
 2
 transport chhot main badhotaree-naukareepesha varg kaam karne ke liye dur-dur tak kii jagahon par jaataa he
 He has to use such means as bus, auto rickshaw, train, his car, etc
 But the discount on these is only 800 rupees a month which is very low according to today's rates
 isamen turant badhotaree honi chahie
 3
 shiksha bhatte main badhotaree-shiksha main yani bacchon kii padhai ke liye chhot mahaj 100 rupye prati balak he jabaki skulon main tution fee badhkar 500 rupye se lekar 1,000 rupye tak ho chuki he
 Therefore, the government should take the limit of this exemption to a realistic level
 isi tarah hostal main rahane waalon ke liye yah chhot mahaj 300 rupye prati maah he
 It should also be increased
 4
 Modal exemption limit - Currently the exemption limit for treatment and medicines in the country is just Rs 15,000 annually
 ilaaj or dawaaon ke badhate kharch ke kaaran isamen turant badhotaree kii jaani chahie
 This amount was fixed long ago
 is badhaakar kam se kam 25,000 kar diya janaa chahie
 5
 altie kii seemaa main badhotaree-abhi sarkaar chaar saal main do baar altie par chhot detii he isamen badhotaree honi chahie
 This will give a boost to tourism in the country
 6
 In Infrastructure Bonds-2010, the government had made a provision of exemption of Rs 20,000 for investment in infrastructure bonds
 lekin ise hataa diya gaya tha
 By implementing this now, the working class will be ready for investment
 7
 House rental exemption - For those who are not able to get house rental receipt, the tax exemption is only up to Rs 2,000 per month
 is raashi ko badhanaa chahie kyonki shaharon main makaanon ke kiraaye kaaphi bad gaye hai
 8
 pement of live incashment-jo log apni chhuttiyon ke badale paise le lete hai unke liye inakam tex chhot kii seemaa mahaj 3 lakh rupye he
 For 16 years this amount is intact
 tankhwaahen badhane ke kaaran inamen badhotaree jaruri ho gai he
 It should be increased to at least Rs 10 lakh
 9
 Fixed Deposit Deadline - Currently the tax free FD deadline is five years
 isliye log isamen paisa fansaana nahin chaahate
 The government should reduce this to 36 months
 isse naukareepesha varg is ore aakarshith hoga
 10
 sarvice tex daayre main katautee-is samay kai tarah kii sevaaon par sarvice tex he
 The working class has to bear the brunt of this and many, unknowingly, service tax is taken from them which should not have been taken
 sarkaar ko inaki sankhya ghataani chahie taaki tex kaa boj kam ho

 ) This time the discussion of universal basic income scheme related to transferring a certain amount every month to the account of poor families of the country is hot
 na keval bharat balki duniya ke kai deshon main is par bahes chal rahi he or samay-samay par isse jude payalat project bhi chalaae ja rahe hai
 Before the election, when politicians use it to woo voters, economists predict the impact it will have on the economy
 ek varg kaa maananaa he ki universal basic inakam skim shram ko hathouttasahit karegaa or log aalsee ho jaaenge or sharaab kii khapat bhi bad jaaegi
 But the results of the pilot project involving Universal Basic Income Scheme were positive and a fixed income indicated improvement in health, productivity and financial stability of citizens
 payalat project or nattejeybharat main janvari 2011 or 2012 main do payalat kaaryakramon ko madhya pradesh main sharu kiya gaya tha
 The program was a controlled trial of the Service (SEWA) Self Employed Women's Associations and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) with the Government of India and the Government of Madhya Pradesh
 pehle project main 20 samaan gaanvon ko chunaa gaya tha
 In these, cash was transferred to all the families in eight villages, no amount was given to any family in the remaining 12 villages
 duusare payalat main, jo 12 maheene tak chalaa, do samaan adivasee gaanvon ko chunaa gaya tha
 In one village everyone gets the amount and in the other village no one gets anything
 donon payalat project ke dauraan 6,000 se adhik vyaktiyon tak nakad paisa pahunchaa
 In May 2013, SEWA gave its preliminary findings from the study at the conference "unconditional Cash Transfer: Finding from Pilot Studies" held in Delhi
 jiske mutabik jin gaanvon main yah raashi pahunchi vahaan bacchon ke poshan main sudhaar dikhaa or unhen santulit aahaar mila
 The rate of disease in these villages was low, due to continuous treatment and regular medication intake
 labhaarthi pariwaron main adhik pashudhan tha, jisase swasthya or vittiya sthirataa main sudhaar hua
 Additionally, productivity rates increased, as school attendance rates of children were higher in recipient villages
 nakad hastantaran praapt karne vaale gaanvon main schuli shiksha or krishi par adhik vyay hota tha
 Better income and higher agricultural yields were also boosted by this income
 nishkarsh main kaha gaya ki universal basic inakam kii kuch chintaaen thi ki yah kaam shram ko hatotsahit karegaa or sharaab kii khapat ko badhayega
 However, cash recipients had higher rates of labor and work
 duusare gaanvon kii tulana main labhaarthi gaanvon main adhik sharaab kii khapat kaa bhi koi pramaan nahin tha balki adivasee gaanv main, sharaab kii khapat kam hui
 The impact on labor productivity was particularly strong for women and tribal communities
 iske saath hi is gaanvon kii vittiya sthirataa main kaaphi sudhaar hua
 In other countries, Project America has started trials in California, in which 130 people will be given $ 500 for 18 months and a check will be made about whether its effect will be, whether people will become lazy or their work capacity will be increased

 Informant's view: On an online site, Shankar Iyer, Fellow and Senior Analyst, IDFC, says, "suppose that all those who come under the Food Security Act get the benefit of the minimum income scheme
" aise main desh ke 97 karod log is skim ke labhaanviton main shaamil honge
 On average there are five people in a family, so this number changes to 200 million families
 is tarah agar ek parivaar ko har maheene 1000 rupee diya jaataa he to is yojana kaa karch 24 xxrep 4 0 karod ru
 Which will be ten percent of the government's expenditure this year
 saath hi 167 lakh karod kii jidipi main ye aankada 1

 ek ore sarkaar kii ore se paryaavaran diwas ke maukey par naseehat dete hue akhabaaron or tivi channelon par mahange vigyaapan die jate hai, to duusari ore vah khud hi in par amal nahin karti
 The Delhi government did something similar
 har saal rajya sarkarein 5 june koparyaavaran divasake maukey par plastic ke istemaal na karne par jor detii hai or vigyapanon ke jariye logon main jaagarukta kaa sandesh bhi detii he, lekin hairaan karne vaali sachai yah he ki paryaavaran ko sabase zyadapradooshitkarne vaali plastic kaa sarkari samaaroh main dhadlle se istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The use of plastic in the Iftar party showed a similar picture at the Iftar party organized by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on the eve of the day, where plastic goods were used heavily
 paryaavaran diwas ke din akhabaaron main vigyaapan ke jariye mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne janata se saamaajik or saarvajanik samaaroh main mitti ke kulhad istemaal karne kii salaah di or unhone khud is par amal nahin kiya
 Through his appeal, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is raising the slogan of 'beat Plastic Pollution', while the Iftar party on the eve of World Environment Day, the Aam Aadmi Party government appeared with plastic bottles
 is kaarykram main dipti siem manish sisodiya, paryaavaran mantri imran hossain ke alaava kai mantri or party netaa maujuud rahe, lekin koi bhi mantri yaa netaa plastic bottle ko lekar aapatti darj karata nahin dikhaa
 Let us tell you that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has also issued an order on 10 August 2017, banning the use of plastic bags of less than 50 microns
 saath hi plastic thili istemaal karne par 5 hajaar rupee taka dand bhi is aadesh main shaamil he
 Kejriwal appeals to the public, however, through advertisements, Kejriwal made 3 major appeals related to plastic pollution
 1, stray animals in urban areas are often found eating garbage with which animals also eat plastic bags which prove fatal to them
 Might be possible
 2, ek baar prayog main aane vaale dispojable plastic or plastic kii theliyon ko dobaaraa upyog main na laaen
 3, Alternatively, bags made of cloth, jute or paper should be used
 ghar se baahar nikalate samay pani kii bottle saath rakhane se plastic kii botalon kaa kachra kam hoga
 Surprisingly, plastic bottles of water are used in large numbers not only iftar party but also in other government events
 in plastic ko dyspose karnaa behad mushkil hota he, iske baavjood sarkarein plastic se nipatane or apni hi apil ko amal main laane ke liye koi thos kadam uthaati najar nahin aa rahi hai

 However, a large number of Pakistani migrants have applied for Indian citizenship
 jaipur main ab tak 122 pakistani visthapiton ko bharat kii naagarikta di ja chuki he
 Citizenship is given on the report of IB, citizenship is given to those who come from Pakistan as refugees only after the report of IB
 pakistani visthapiton ke liye sangharsh karne vaale niketan sanstha ke adhyaksh jai ahuja ne kaha ki abhi bhi pakistani visthapiton ke 5100 aavedan lambit pade hai
 Citizenship is not available due to the timely report of the IB

 The feeling of pleasure is based on the woman's attraction to her partner, how often they have sex each week, and their ratings of sexual satisfaction

 Although the Indian Premier League (IPL) has been linked with controversies, but on Tuesday, Gujarat Lions Brandon mccullum did such work in the field, which can be said that cricket is still legitimate to be called a Gentleman game
 newjiland ke purv captain or gujarat liance ke khilaadi maikulam ne 2017 ipel ke 20wein match main mangalvaar ko royal chalangers bangalore (aaarasibi) ke khilaaf khel bhaavana kaa adbhut parichay diya
 mccullum's sportsmanship also impressed Virat Kohli, the captain of the opposing team RCB
 aaarasibi ke captain ne maikulam se haath milaayaa or kandhe thapthapaakar unhen khel bhaavana kaa pradarshan dene kii badhai di
 Actually, rcb's Chris Gayle was batting during the match on Tuesday
 captain suresh raina unhen out karne ke liye lagaataar planning karte dikhe
 Meanwhile, mccullum took a hard catch of rcb's explosive opener Chris Gayle at the boundary line
 maikulam tab long of par mustaid the or is kaich ko lapakane ke baad vah apni team ke saathiyon ke saath jashn manaane lage
 But mccullum realized that his catch was not right, as he was suspected of touching his hat on the boundary line
 maikulam ampire ke paas daudte hue gaye or unase riple dekhne ke baad faisla lene kii guzarish kii

 That is some T20 domination https: / / t
 co / kfysxsfdko - @ rcbtweets # IPL — indianpremierleague (@IPL) April 18, 2017 The replay clearly showed that mccullum certainly took a great catch, but his hat really touched the boundary line
 ampire ne apana faisla badla or kris gail ko dobaaraa ballebaaji karne ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 Chris Gayle was then dismissed for 77 runs
 yani maikulam kii khel bhaavana ke chalate unki team ko nuksaan hua
 Then this sentiment is less to be praised
 darasal, mangalvaar ko match ke dauraan aaarasibi ke kris gail dhuandhar batting kar rahe the
 Captain Suresh Raina was constantly planning to dismiss him
 isi bich maikulam ne aaarasibi ke visphotak openar kris gail kaa boundry line par mushkil kaich lapka
 mccullum was then on long off and after catching the catch, he started celebrating with his teammates
 magar maikulam ko ahsaas hua ki unka yah kaich sahi nahin he, kyonki unhen apni topi boundry line par chune kaa andeh tha
 mccullum ran to the umpire and requested him to take a decision after watching the replay

 The umpire changed his decision and Chris Gayle was called to bat again
 iske baad kris gail 77 ranon kii pari khelkar out hue
 That is, mccullum's sportsmanship caused a loss to his team
 phir unke is bhaavana kii jitani tarif kii jaae kam he

 co / kfysxsfdko - @ rcbtweets # IPL chhattisgarh ke sahakaari bainkon main notebandi ke dauraan ke sirf paanch dinon main 247 karod rupaye vibhinn khaaton main jamaa hue, ye rakam kiski thi ? kahaan se ai or kiske khate main transfar hui iskaa khulaasa abhi tak nahin ho paaya he
 The bank gave details of the amount deposited under RTI after about one and a half years, but refused to give the names and addresses of the account holders citing confidentiality
 bank dwaara RTI se jo jamaa rakam kii jaankaree mili wo kaaphi sandehaaspad he
 The Congress has demanded a high-level inquiry into the transactions of the cooperative bank
 uskaa aarope he ki yah blike mani he, jo safed hokar rasukhadaaron kii tijori main chali gai
 It has been revealed from the RTI that during demonetisation, between 24 November 2016 to 14 November 2016 i
e
 just five days, Rs 247 crore was deposited in the branches of cooperative banks located in Raipur, Dhamtari, Rajnandgaon, Durg, Bilaspur, Ambikapur and Jagdalpur
 gauratlab he ki aath november 2016 kii ratnotbandilagu kii gai thi
 During this time, there was an influx of old depositors in banks
 sahakaari bainkon ke graahak aamtaur par kisaan hote hai
 The farmers did not have such a huge amount due to the drought conditions that they would have been able to collect Rs 247 crore within just five days
 RTI se is baat kaa bhi khulaasa hua he ki das november 2016 se 31 disambar 2016 ke bich rajya ke sahakaari bank kii shakhaon main 32 karod 52 lakh rupaye ke puraane note jamaa hue
 Suddenly, where did such a huge amount come from in cooperative banks, it remains a matter of thinking even today
 jabaki sahakaari bank apni kharaab mali halaat ke chalate kisaanon se rin kii vasuuli ke liye dabaav bana rahe hai
 Through which medium the amount of 247 crores reached the bank, whose amount is it and when were their accounts opened? The Congress is demanding an inquiry on all these questions
 maatr paanch dinon main sahakaari bainkon kii shakhaon main jo rakam jamaa kii gai he uskaa byora is prakaar he
 50 crore 29 lakh was deposited in Bilaspur, 56 crore 96 lakh in Durg, 10 crore 88 lakh in Ambikapur, 29 crore 35 lakh in Jagdalpur, 60 crore 64 lakh in Raipur and 48 crore 77 lakh in Rajnandgaon
 vipaksh bank kii bhoomika par sawalia nishaan laga rahaa he
 It is alleged that due to government protection, cooperative banks have become factories to convert black money into white money
 niyam-kaayadon ke tahat inke graahakon kii jaanch bhi nahin ho rahi he
 Congress leader and in charge of Chhattisgarh P
P
 el
 Punia has announced that if the Congress comes to power, people who send black money will be sent to jail
 chhattisgarh main sahakaari bank kheti kisaani se jude logon ke liye ridh kii haddi kii tarah he
 Generally, farmers get huge support for agricultural loans, edible seeds, and agricultural implements
 centre or rajya sarkaar kii kai krishi yojanaayen inhi bainkon ke jariye sanchalit hoti he
 More than 80 lakh farmers have accounts in cooperative banks across the state
 sahakaari bank bhi RBI kii policy ke tahat sanchalit hoti he
 The serious thing is that the co-operative banks refused to give details of the deposits during the demonetisation
 is maamle main gopneeyata kaa hawala dekar RTI ke tamaam aavedan sahakaari bainkon ne khaarij bhi kar die the, lekin shikayatakartaaon ne jab soochna ayog main apil kii tab ja kar sahakaari bainkon ne notebandi ke dauraan jamaa rakam ke bare jaankaree to di lekin behad simit
 He hid details of the whereabouts and deposits of the account holders
 philhal is maamle ne tool pakad liya he
 The Congress is busy in besieging the government regarding the identity of the account holders and the functioning of the bank
 iske liye usne kai jilon main dharna pradarshan shuru kar diya he
 Its charge is clear that the money is from the ruling leaders of the state
 isiilie bank RTI act tak ko bandhak bana rakhi he

 When Shakti Singh, a resident of village Baniyani in Rohtak's home district of Hooda, tried to run away by throwing a shoe, the people sitting next to her grabbed her
 baad main police ne use poochtacha ke liye hiraasat main le liya
 Shakti said at the police station that she was shot during a demonstration a few days ago and today she took the step because the state government had promised her a compensation of Rs 10 lakh and a government job to complete
