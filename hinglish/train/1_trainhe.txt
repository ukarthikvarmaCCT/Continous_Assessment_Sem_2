 kab launch hogapichley saal company ne 23 agast ko Note 8 launch kiya tha or mumkin he is baar bhi agast main hi launch kiya jayega
 However, according to a report by The Investor, Samsung can launch the flagship phablet with a big screen only in July
 slashgier kii report ke mutabik tipsar Ice Universe main aane vaale Galaxy Note 9 ke liye 7 mukhya fitures bataae hai jo isamen die ja sakate hai
 It has a 3,850 mah powerful battery, new s Pen stylus, and an under display fingerprint scanner
 iske lava biksabi ke nae varjan ko bhi Note 9 ke saath pesh kiya jayega
 The special thing is that Samsung can bring its new custom user interface with Galaxy Note 9 which is being called Crown UX
 pichley kareeb do maheene se iraq lahuluhaan he
 In these two months, suddenly a new militant organization called ISIS has not only risen but has become a threat to the whole world
 par ab baat sirf iraq tak nahin rah gai he
 Iraq's heat is beginning to be felt as far as India
 ji haa, iraq main iess kii taraf se ladane ke liye kai hindustani bhi vahaan ja pahunche hai or kai vahaan jane kii raah dekh rahe hai
 In the name of religion, this blind race to control the rule of Iraq has so far killed more than 5 thousand dead bodies, even more shocking is that a large number of innocent people, women and children have died in the evening 
 lekin aaie, ab aapako iraq se dur apane hindustan kii ek aisi tasviir dikhaate hai jiskaa iraq main chal rahi is maujuuda ladaai se bada nazadiiki rishta he
 No one was killed in the Low Intensity Blast in Farakkhana area on July 10, but when police and intelligence agencies began investigating it, its wires were directly linked to Iraq and the ongoing fighting there
 pehali nazar main is baat par yakeen karnaa bhi mushkil lagata he lekin is blast se jude pahaluon ko khangaal rahi khufia agenciyon ko tafteesh ke dauraan jo kuch pataa chalaa wo chaunkaane vaala he
 If sources are to be believed, there are many young people of India who have gone to Iraq to help the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ie ISIS, orchestrating the death in Iraq
 bagdadi kii aguwai main qaatilon kii jo fuj lagaataar iraq main kahar barapa rahi he, usamen apane hindustan ke ladke bhi shaamil ho chuke hai or ab tak kii jaankaree ke mutabik inaki taadaad takreeban 20 ke aas-paas he
 Almost the same thing came up in connection with the investigation of Pune blast, four families of Thane near Mumbai also cleared up late
 darasal, in sabhi pariwaron kaa ek-ek ladkaa iraq kii ladaai se pehle yaa phir is ladaai ke dauraan naa sirf apane ghar se balki hindustan se bhi rahasyamayi tareeke se gaayab ho gaya
 At first, their families did not even realize this, but when they looked at the time and place of their children disappearing, their suspicion became stronger
 phir isi dauraan in ladakon main se ek ne khud hi iraq se apane ghar telephone kar khud ke iesas main shaamil ho jane kii jaankaree de di
 But the question is, how did all these boys reach Iraq without telling the housemates? Who made them reach ISIS in Iraq? And after all, why are the youth of India thousands of miles away from Iraq sympathetic to ISIS? How did some young people of India become obsessed with going to Iraq? After all, how did some people understand the way to go to paradise to join the war in Iraq? a young man who has reached Iraq may have made a statement through his letter, but this statement actually describes the condition of the youth like him
 apane parivaar ke naam aarif kaa khat'main ab ghar chhod kar ja rahaa hum
 i have to participate in maidan-e-jung for Allah, so this is the right time to be with you
 meri pyaari validaan, kyonki agar main ab bhi iraq main chal rahi is ladaai main shaamil hone ke liye nahin gaya, to maut ke vaqt farishte mujhase ye sawaal karenge ki akhir main allaah kii zamin tak kyon nahin pahunchaa? mujhe ab kisi baat kaa malaal nahin, inshollah ab aap sabhi se jananath main hi mulaaqaat hogi
 Believe me, when i used to see you all in my house breaking the laws and regulations made by Allah, that is, i used to cry from inside
 aapako sirget pite, tivi dekhte, najayas taalluqaat rakhte, aaraam kii zindagi jite, ibaadat or duaon se dur rahete or dadhi nahin badhaate hue dekh kar tadapata tha
 Believe me, all these things will force you to scorch in the fire of fire
 main apni bahanon ke aksar tivi dekhne se behad pareshaan tha
 She used to watch such things on TV, which rested on the foundation of nudity, obscenity and abusive thinking
 ye bahut bada gunaah he
 Similarly, music is also un-islamic and all these things are weapons of Satan
 'aarif maajid(disclemur: ye aarif ke likhe khat kaa aksharsh: anuwaad nahin he, balki khat ko samajhane ke liye mote taur par iskaa bhavarth he
 ) This is the account of Arif Majid, a young man living near Kalyan in Mumbai, who is now being told that he has gone to Iraq to join the war between Shias and Sunnis in Iraq
 darasal, maajid kaa likhaa ye khat khud uske gharavaalon ne kalyaan police ko saunpa he or police philhal maajid samet kul chaar aise naujavaanon kii talash main juty he, jinke iraq pahunch jane kaa shaq he inamen se teen jahaan ejineering kii padhai kar chuke hai, vahiin ek 12veen paas he

 This week's Bigg Boss was named jasleen-anoop Jalota in a way
 screen par unhen hi zyaadaatar dekha gaya he
 In the sixth minute of the most experienced player of Diego Maradona's team, Gabriel Ivan Heinz, Argentina started their campaign in World Cup football by defeating Nigeria 1–0 here
 do baar ke champion argentina kii team main sabaki nigahen star striker leonnelle messi par lagi hui thi lekin kai achche prayaason ke baavjood vah apana khaataa kholane main naakaam rahe
 Maradona's team, however, managed to score the entire three points in the Group b match with a goal coming off Heinz's header
 argentina ne shuru se hi hamalavar tevar apanaaye or nyeegeria par dabaav banane kii ranneeti apanaayi jisamen vah safal bhi rahaa
 Heinz led his team to a 1-0 lead in the sixth minute on a corner kick from Juan Sebastian Veron from a header from 12 yards
 hinj ke saamne tab nyeegeria kaa koi khilaadi nahin tha or unhone iskaa puraa phayda uthaaya
 Maradona then bounced and the fans of the team lifted the Ellis Park Stadium on the head
 isse do minute pehle bhi argentini team ko gol karne kaa mauka mila tha
 Messi then proceeded by dodging several defenders
 unhone gonjalej hinguine ko gend saunpi lekin vah gol karne kaa aasaan mauka chook gayi
 Higuain also got another chance in the 21st minute but then he shot straight into the goalkeeper's hand on a pass from Kalres Tavage
 wo jo aatank kaa aakaa he, wo jo dehshat kaa doosraa naam he, wo jo insaaniyat kaa dushman he, uske jhande kaa rang bhi kaala he
 His exploits are also black
 uskaa jehan bhi kaala he or ab apane gurgon kii jaan bachaane ke liye usne tarika bhi kaala apanaaya he
 His terrorists are saving their lives in Mosul, Iraq, by hiding their faces in the black burqas of women
 kaale burke kii puri kahani aapako dikhaaen
 Before that, see that Operation Black Crow, which will expose the curtains on the black misdeeds of Baghdadi
 jo hakeekat bagdadi ne duniya se chhupaai
 Which did not even catch the camera
 wo jo aatank kaa asli cheharaa he
 He is hidden behind a dark black curtain
 aaj use apni ankhon se dekhie
 See how Baghdadi wreaks havoc in the Sultanate of Terror
 kaise achche bhale insaan or puri kii puri insaaniyat ko palabar main goliyon se bhun dete hai uske aatanki
 Who is behind this panic of his
 haivaaniyat kii vajah kya he
 Who is the evil mind behind terror? tamaam ke tamaam sawaalon kaa jawaab he ye video
 In which there is also terror, helplessness, helplessness, war with life and death
 kareeb dhai minute ke is video ko bahut gaur se dekhie
 If you see this, you will know that the more we know ISIS, the more dangerous and dangerous it is
 maasoom bacchon ke haathon main bandookis video main maanon se bichhadte unke bachche hai, jinke haathon main khilaunon kii jagah bandook he
 There is a pile of corpses in the pits and bulldozers filling those pits
 maut to maut zindagi bhi jaanwaron se badtar he or puraa kaa puraa shahar jaise ek biabaan he
 This is the reality of the Sultanate of Baghdadi that has actually been given the appearance of a TV series
 blike kro yani kaala kauwwa naam ke is sho kii kahani us yajidi mahila ke ird-gird gumti he, jise aatank kii sultanate main jabaran rahane ke liye majaboor kiya jaataa he
 Actually, the whole of this story narrates the truth of ISIS through the request of a Yazidi woman
 magar ab isi film main yajidi mahila kaa kirdaar nibhaane vaali kuwaiti kalakaar mona shaddad kii jindagi ke peeche haath dhokar pad gaye hai bagdadi ke aatanki
 Kuwaiti Artists are getting threats: In the morning and evening, an attempt is being made to kill and threaten Mona Shaddad
 kirdaar ko nibhaane se pehle or ab kirdaar ko nibhaate vaqt shaddad ko rojaanaa dhamkee bhare phone aa rahe hai
 Because the way Black Crow is masking the face of Baghdadi through this show, he is fearing to open his pole
 itnaa hi nahin, is puure sho main dikhaaya gaya he ki kaise islam ke naam par musalamaanon ko dhokhaa dekar bagdadi apni sultanate kaayam kar rahaa he
 While the reality is that he himself is a bad name for the name of Islam, which is tricking the youth and straightening its owl
 ek tarafa propeganda video jari kar bagdadi ab tak duniya ke hajaaron-lakhon yuvaaon ko gumraah kar chukaa he
 To show the right path to the youth through the show, it is now the turn to show people like him a straight path by removing them from the clutches
 jo kaam is sho ke jariye kiya ja rahaa he
 So Baghdadi's best effort is now that the show should be closed at the earliest
 or agar aisa na ho sake to sho main kaam karne vaale kalakaaron ko hi maar daalaa jaae
 The videos by which Baghdadi increased its power, increased its sultanate, perpetuated its horror, misled the youth around the world and defeated the armies
 
 Baghdadi is now defeated by the same video
 blike kro naam kii is tivi siries se wo itnaa ghabaraaya hua he ki ab isamen kaam karne vaale kalakaaron ko jaan se maar dena chahta he
 Know why, because he does not want the black truth to be revealed to the world in the way he is tricking people in the name of religion
 bagdadi kii pole kholane vaali he ye tivi serisbagadadi kii pole kholane vaali ye tivi siries blike kro middle east broadcasting centre yani embisi ke jariye arab ke tamaam mulkon or uttari africa deshon main dikhaai ja rahi he
 The purpose of which is to save people from the deceit of Baghdadi in the name of religion
 is tivi siries ke doirector ali jabar ke mutabik, logon ke jehan se iesas ko nikaalnaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Because now it is not just an organization but now it is an ideology
 or ab kisi ke vichaaron ko bam se nahin maar sakate
 You need even stronger ideas to fight terrorist thoughts
 
 ISIS has come out of our society for a very long time due to nullity and wrong religious teachings
 doirector ke liye sirdard bani ye serisdoirector ali jabar ke ye vichaar or unki ye tivi siries unke or unke unit ke liye sirdard bane hue hai
 Especially for Kuwaiti artist Mona Shaddad, who plays a woman trapped in the clutches of ISIS, who is receiving threatening calls in the morning and evening to play the role
 mona kahati he ki, 'haa ye sach he ki mujhe dhamkiyaan mil rahi hai lekin main dari hui bilkul bhi nahin hum
 If you had asked this question a few years ago, i would have said that yes i am scared
 magar ab main kisi se nahin darati
 Because my God is protecting me
 jo role main play kar rahi hum wo bahut ahm he
 Because with this character, i can tell the world how easily terrorists brainwash people
 or kaise unhen lagata he ki wo achche makasad ke liye aatankiyon ke saath jud rahe hai, jo ki bas ek chhalaava he
 'discussion of this TV series everywhere, this TV series made on ISIS is discussed all over the world today
 magar is tivi siries ko shoot karne ke dauraan lagaataar hamale kii ashanka se puure ke puure kru member khauf main rahe
 However, at a cost of $ 10 million, the film was heavily guarded while shooting in Lebanon
 apni haar ko kareeb dekh kar aies ke aatankwaadi ab sirf burka pahanakar hi apni jaan nahin bachaa rahe hai balki aam logon ko bhi apni dhaal bana rahe hai
 Compared to the Iraqi army, they are trying to get these common people ahead and flee from behind them
 magar kuch hi aatanki isamen kaamyaab hue hai
 Most were either killed by the army or arrested
 iesas ke khatme ke liye mosul main uski haar behad jaruri he
 Occupation of Mosul in June 2014, independence of the city of Mosul is very important for the elimination of IS
 darasal june, 2014 main mosul par kabja karne ke baad bagdadi ne ise na sirf apane aatank ke samrajya kii rajdhani banaaya balki yaheen se usne khud kii khilaafat kaa elaan bhi kiya
 So if Baghdadi is defeated in Mosul, it obviously means the end of the Islamic State from Iraq
 itnaa hi nahin, mosul main tel kaa akut bhandar he
 If this city goes by hand, then a major source of IS earnings will be closed
 iske baad iraq ke mahaj 10 fisadi hisse par hiaies kaa prabhaavarah jayega
 According to the Pentagon, the Iraqi army is moving ahead of its intended target
 haalanki ye bhi andeshaa jataayaa ja rahaa he ki aatankiyon se mosul ko khaali karaane kii ye jang lambii khinch sakati he
 Terrorists can go to any extent
 aatanki iraqi sena ko mosul main daakhil hone se rokane ke liye javaabi karrwai main kisi bhi had tak ja rahe hai
 Apart from targeting the army tanks, the terrorists are spreading oil inside the city and setting fire to it, causing a tremendous smoke of smoke throughout the city and in the guise of this bomb, they are preparing a way to escape for themselves
 ek taraf jahaan mosul kaa ye mahayuddh pratishtha kaa sawaal ban chukaa he, vahiin shahar main rahane vaale 15 lakh logon kii suraksha ko lekar bhi phikr badhane lagi he
 It is suspected that terrorists can use common people as a shield to save their lives
 lihaaja aise halaat se nipatane ke liye iraqi sena ne mosul shahar par kaaphi taadaad main parche giraae hai
 In which the common people are being advised what they have to do for their safety during the fight
 teen lakh log chhod chuke hai gharsanyukt raashtra ko andeshaa he ki mosul main ladaai ke chalate yahaan se kareeb ek lakh irakiyon ko jaan bachaane ke liye syria yaa turki bhaagna pad saktaa he
 More than three lakh people have already left their homes due to terror terror in Iraq
 lihaaja dobaaraa aise halaat paidaa hone kii sthiti main sharnaarthiyon kii madad ke intjaam abhi se shuru kar die gaye hai
 Preparations for this operation, which began to free Mosul from the clutches of the terrorists, had been going on for about a month
 abhi iraqi fouj mosul tak pahunchi bhi nahin he magar abhi se hi aatanki baukhalaaye najar aa rahe hai
 Experts believe that the countdown to the complete elimination of the Islamic State in Iraq has begun
 kyonki iraq kaa yahi shahar abhi bhi aies kaa garh he
 His feet have been uprooted from other areas
 syria main bhi sirf rakka shahar main hi islamic state kaa kabja rah gaya he
 In such a situation, the defeat of Mosul would be the biggest defeat of Baghdadi ever

 haryana ke purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ko punjab or haryana hoicourt ne raahat pahunchaai he
 In its judgment on Thursday, it rejected the report of the Dhingra Commission constituted to investigate the alleged illegality in granting land use license during Hooda's tenure
 hooda ke kaarykaal main gurugram main license pradaan karne ke kathith labhaarthiyon main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke jija robert wadra bhi shaamil the
 On Hooda's petition against the formation of the Dhingra Commission, a two-member bench on Thursday ruled that there was no malicious intent in setting up the commission in 2015, but there was procedural irregularity in issuing notice to Hooda
 ek jaj ne report khaarij kar karte hue aadesh diya ki hooda ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii ja sakati
 At the same time, other judges said that due to these flaws, it does not exist from the beginning
 saath hi adaalat ne kaha ki report kaa prakaashan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 However, the judge differed in opinion on a further step after a procedural irregularity in issuing notice to Hooda under Section 8B of the Commission of Inquiry Act by a member commission headed by Justice (retd) SN Dhingra
 haryana hoicourt ke edwocket general baldev raaj mahajan ke mutabik, ek jaj chaahate the ki hooda ko keval nae sir se notice jari kiya jaae, jabaki duusare jaj kii raay thi ki ek nayaa ayog gathit kiya jaae
 The verdict was then sent to the Chief Justice of the High Court to set up a three-member bench to resolve differences
 bench ne apane faisle main paaya ki haryana sarkaar ne jo ayog kaa gathan kiya vah sahi he, lekin ayog ne hooda ko saman karne ke liye jo notice jari kiya to niyamon ke mutabik nahin he
 One judge said that the commission may issue a fresh notice to HUDA, but another judge is of the opinion that the term of the commission has been completed
 vah ab notice jari nahin kar saktaa
 After the separation of the two judges, now the Chief Justice will refer the matter to the third judge
 court ne yah bhi mana ki ayog kaa gathan kanuunan sahi he or janhit main he
 Till the decision of the third judge, the report of the commission was sealed, that seal will remain closed and the government will not be able to take any action on it
 purv mukhyamantribhupendra singh hoodane ayog ke gathan ko hai court main chunauti de rakhi he
 His lawyer had argued that his client had asked the Commission several times under the Right to Information to the Commission about the process of formation and the concrete facts for formation, but the government failed to give information
 sarkaar ne hoicourt or supreme court main is cese kii sunwaayee ke dauraan bhi ve tathy court main nahin pesh kiye
 Hooda has alleged in his petition that the Khingra Commission was formed not for the public interest but because of political enmity
 iske liye cabinet kii manjuuri bhi nahin lee gai
 The decision of the Chief Minister cannot be considered as a decision of the Cabinet

 Companies have to be prepared in every way for this increase

 antarrashtriya mudra kosh ke purv pramukh strans kaan ko france kii police ne ek veshyavriti giroh ke maamle main hiraasat main liya he
 Strauss Kahn is expected to be interrogated in the city of Leil in northern France
 police ne apni jaanch ke dauraan kai veshyaaon se poochtacha kii he jisamen unhone strans kaam ke saath sambandh banane kii baat maani he
 Strauss Kahn has not denied having a relationship, but in his explanation has said that while making the relationship, he did not know that they were prostitutes
 france kii police ne veshyavriti giroh chalaane ke aarope main aath logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Three of these are said to be close to Strauss Kahn
 Although prostitution is perfectly legal in France, it is illegal for others to supply prostitutes and misuse company money for it
 strans kaan ne sambandh banane se inkaar to nahin kiya he lekin apni safai main ye kaha he ki sambandh banaate samay unhen pataa nahin tha ki ve veshyaayein hai
 French police have arrested eight people on charges of running a prostitution gang

 The cold has knocked and the mist and fog brought with it
 haalanki kuch logon ko is mausam se zyada fark nahin padataa, par zyaadaatar logon ke liye kohre vaala mausam musiibat ban jaataa he
 If seen, fog is not a harmful thing, because it is formed by the freezing of the atmosphere's water vapor
 par pradooshan kii vajah se shaharon ke liye isaki paribhaasha badal gai he
 Smog and suspended particles, that is, a fog formed around small contaminated particles, say that smog can destroy our entire respiratory system
 pradooshan kii vajah se hoti he ankhon kii jalan, jaane kaise bacheiske asar kaa andaja aap apni ankhon main jalan, naak main khujali, gale main kharash or khaansee jaise lakshanon se laga sakate hai
 These problems are common with fog
 visheshgyon ke anusaar sardiyon main saans kii nalee zyada samvedansheel ho jaati he
 This causes the windpipe to shrink
 yahi vajah he ki aise mausam main saans ke rogiyon kii ashanka bad jaati he
 Just eat this fruit once a day, and it will be amazing
 
 
 kohre kii vajah se hone vaali pareshaani ke liye kahin na kahin dharti kaa gurutvkarshan bhi jimmedaar he
 Actually, the viruses found in the fog, due to the gravity of the earth, come close to the ground and enter us through the nose and mouth
 ankhon kii jalan or thakaan dur karne ke liye aajamaayen ye gharelu upassthma ke marijon par khataryasthma marijon ke liye dhundh behad khatarnaak sabit ho sakati he
 This is because there is a layer of pollution in the mist
 isamen nitrogen, ozon, carbon mono oxide particals jaise khatarnaak gas maujuud hot hai
 Burn the leaf, wood etc
 away from the smoke
 saans se sambandhit visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki asthma rogiyon ko rojaanaa ghar ke andar hi vyaayaam jarur karnaa chahie
 This increases their immunity and reduces the effect of mist
 kya karenbahut jaruri na ho to ghar se baahar na nikalen
 If it is very important to leave home, then cover your ears, nose and mouth well
 ghar kii khidkiyaan band rakhen, jisase koharaa aapke ghar ke andar na aa sake
 Follow these 5 methods to avoid viral
 
 
 dama yaa saans ke rogi hai to sardi se batch kar rahen
 Keep the entire body covered, especially the throat, head and ears
 doctor ke sampark main rahen
 Also fix the dose of your inhaler
 sardiyon main pani thanda hone kii vajah se sabun or pani se haath dhonaa kam kar dete hai
 Do not give up this habit
 haath se sabase zyada bimaariyaan sanchalit hoti hai
 If you feel lethargic in bathing, use lukewarm water
 subah-shaam steam len
 You can avoid these diseases just by washing your hands before eating
 Don't you go on a walk in the morning if there is foggy weather
 isse phayda kam nuksaan zyada hoga
 If you have respiratory disease, do not take bath in cold morning

 Anubhuti, who is studying at Agrasen College in the capital, has to come from Uttamnagar to Laxminagar for coaching and she travels by bus

 If the metro becomes free then money will be saved
 isse bhi ahm baat: metro zyada surakshit he
 The realization only adds to this that her college lady guard will benefit more because she does not travel by metro due to higher fare
 unhone ye baaten june ke pehle hakrate main mahilaon ke liye metro or bas yatra mukrat karne kii ghoshnaa ke baad logon kii raay jaanane ke liye bas main india today tivi kii team ke saath safar kar rahe dilli ke up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya se kahin
 Obviously, if the journey for women in the metro and buses is allowed, then the pockets of more than 8 lakh women, their movement and above all their daily lives, will have a direct impact on their lifestyle
 ek andeshaa jataayaa ja rahaa he ki mukrat safar se metro main bheed badhegi
 The opinion of Delhi Government is clear about this
 uskaa maananaa he ki metro ke tisare charan kii yojana ke vakt dilli metro rail korporation (dmarsi) ne rojaanaa 40 lakh logon ke metro kii sawari karne kaa anumaan lagaaya tha lekin abhi tak yah aankada 25 lakh ke aasapaas pahunchaa he
 So there is no possibility of increasing the crowd more than expected
 ab baat aati he suraksha kii
 DMRC survey says that one-third of the passengers in the metro are women
 pichhali baar metro kaa kiraaya badaae kii vajah se kaaphi sankchaya main kaamgaar mahilaayein fatfat seva, tempo, shering auto jaise yatayaat ke apekshaakrit saste lekin asurakshit sadhano kaa istemaal karne ko majaboor ho gayi
 Jasmine Shah, vice-president of the Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC), the think tank of the Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi, says: "after increasing the central government's fare in March 2017, the number of Metro passengers decreased from 28 lakh daily to 25 lakh
 iskaa sabase zyada asar mahilaon par hua
 We hope that after such subsidy, women will be able to use Delhi's safest mode of transport, metro and DTC buses, which also have marshals deployed
 ''asal sawaal he ki yah kab or kaise lagu hoga? sarkaar or aam aadmi party kaa kahana he ki ise lagu karne ke taur-tareekon ke liye prastaav taiyaar karne ke vaaste dmarsi se baat chal rahi he
 The issue will be brought before the cabinet soon and is expected to be implemented from August
 dilli sarkaar se muft yatra kii bharpai ke taur par dmarsi ne 1,506 karod ru
 Have asked for
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke mutabik, dmarsi ne software apadet karne or yojana ko lagu karne ke liye aath maheene kaa vakt maanga he taaki mahilaayein card se bhi muft safar kar saken
 Also, there is an immediate way to start the closed token window of 170 metro stations and issue free tokens
 dmarsi ke prastaav ke mutabik, muft safar kii yojana ko kiraaya tay karne vaali fere phikseshan cameti kii manjuuri leni hogi
 Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot tells India Today, "the decision to make public transport free is under consideration with various transport agencies
 iske liye bajet aam aadmi party kii sarkaar uplabdh kara rahi he
 We are waiting for the cabinet to pass the resolution
 ''muft safar ke liye mahilaon ko gulabi rang ke token lene honge
 After the completion of the journey, these tokens should be returned and they are not misused, women tokens should not be used by men, for this, the option of deploying about one thousand doors of Delhi Government Metro at Civil Defense Volunteer Metro stations
 Can also try metro puure ensiaar main yani noida, gajiabad, gudgaanv, faridabad tak fail chuki he, lihaaja in shaharon kii mahilaon ko yojana se baahar karne par abhi tak vichaar nahin hua he or sarkaar maanati he ki yah kaam mushkil bhi he
 The thing to keep men out of the plan is the perception within the government that men have other transportation options, such as bikes, etc
 unke liye suraksha koi masalaa nahin he
 More than 5,500 DTC and cluster buses run in the capital
 ye metro root se itar disha main jaati hai or gaanvon tak pahunchati hai
 The Delhi government will have no problem in freeing the buses for women
 dilli main bason ke tikat mashin se katate hai
 Arrangements will be made by putting the option of women in its software
 mahilaon ko chhot kaa phayda lenaa he yaa nahin, conductor unase puch legaa
 But it is certain that the women who did not go to the metro due to high expenses will definitely turn to it
 is yojana par raajnneeti bhi khub chal padi he
 The BJP is saying that it is a jumla
 iskaa boj karadaataaon par daalaa jayega
 According to the BJP, people do not want such free travel
 udhar, janata kii raay jaanane nikle sisodiya ke alaava mukhyamantri kejariwal kah rahe hai ki unhen ek bhi mahila aisi nahin mili jisane muft safar kii yojana par khushi na jataai ho
 But BJP state president Manoj Tiwari has described it as Shigufa, while Union Urban Development Minister Hardeep Puri, in a press conference last week, termed the announcement of the Delhi government as a token window fraud, saying that DMRC or his ministry has not received any such proposal
 
 javaabi press conference main sisodiya bole, ''puri ji, aap bas aashirwad de dijie
 We have a plan as well as money
 '' dilli sarkaar kaa kahana he ki use centre sarkaar se anumati kii jarurat nahin he kyonki yah kanoon-vyavastha yaa jameen kaa maamla nahin he
 Just like the relief in electricity bill, Delhi government can do it
 fere phikseshan cameti se prastaav paas karaane ko lekar dilli sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki yah kaam ho jayega
 For this, the center will just have to issue a notification
 ab tak ke anubhav yahi kehete hai ki centre sarkaar aasaani se dilli sarkaar ko koi manjuuri detii nahin he
 The plan is being linked to the assembly elections due in 2020
 yah ghoshnaa ab itani zyada charchaa main aa chuki he ki ise lagu karne yaa isamen adnge lagane kaa phayda-nuksaan rajnatik dalon ko uthaanaa padegaa
 This will also affect business
 federation of sadar bazaar treders association ke adhyaksh rakesh yadav kehete hai, ''agar metro muft hui to ladies customer holcel market kaa rukh karengi
 Secondly, women will get more employment than men because they did not travel long for jobs because of distance and expenses
 aise kaamon ke liye jisamen chote safar kii jarurat hoti he, vyapaaree bhi mahilaon ko naukari par rakhana pasand karenge kyonki unka aana-janaa free hoga
 Apart from this, women will also have money
 mahilaon kaa rojgaar 30 fisadi tak badhegaa
 Just the government should plan to maintain the metro arrangements properly
 '' vyapaaree anumaan jataate hai ki holcel bazaar main chijen sasti milengi or mahilaayein ek duusare ko ye baaten bataaengi to bikri badhegi
 However, in the cities of other countries of the world, there is a system of free public transport to deal with jams and pollution

 The free metro and bus will benefit more than 8 lakh women who travel by metro now for Rs 1,506 crore

 There will be saving upto Rs

 Estonia's bus is not new in the world
 Free transport in some cities of the European country Estonia and from July 1, 2019, the whole country is free road Transport will be done

 noida athurity dwaara sector 123 main banaaye ja rahe damping ground ko lekar logon kaa virodh lagataar badhata ja rahaa he
 In this episode, on Sunday, more than 1000 people living in Noida took to the streets to protest against the Noida Authority
 logon kaa gussa is baat ko lekar tha ki noida athurity engiti ko gumraah karke unke gharon ke paas damping ground bana rahi he, jabaki ye log chaahate hai ki damping ground yahaan naa banaaya jaae
 In fact, people say that if the dumping ground is built here, then the lives of millions of people living in the society of Greater Noida along with Noida and Noida Extension will become difficult
 saath hi is puure ilaake kii aabhohawaa bhi jahrili ho jaaegi jiskaa logon kii sehat par bura asar padegaa
 People say that the building of dumping ground will not only affect the people living here but also many villages here which will not be affected
 noida sector 123 kii ek socity main rahane vaali mahila kaa kahana tha ki agar damping ground yahaan banataa he to hawa to kharaab hogi hi saath hi ground water bhi jaharila ho jayega, jisase ilaake main rahane vaale logon kii sehat par kharaab asar padegaa
 At the same time, villagers believe that their crops will also be affected due to the dumping ground
 vahiin noida kii in socity mensaalon se kamkar rahi aradbalue kii maane to unhone noida athurity se pichley dinon artiai ke jariye sawaal poocha tha ki kya is jagah par koi damping ground banane kaa prapojal he to athurity ne is baat se inkaar kar diya tha or ab wo apane bayaan se mukar rahi he
 Those opposing said that on this matter, they have repeatedly voiced their voice to the MP and Chief Minister of the area but no one is listening to them
 virodh karne vaale logon ne saaf kar diya ki jab tak ye faisla vaapis nahin ho jaataa tab tak unka virodh isi tarah jari rahegaa
 As technology progressed over time, our cell phones changed not only their appearance but also their usage
 ek samay tha jab phone kaa bill kol minutes or SMS kendrit tha, lekin ab aisa nahin he
 Smartphones have brought the Internet world in our palm, so a large part of the phone bill has started to depend on data charges
 video colling or whatp se lekar vibar jaise App ne to bill main colling or SMS se zyadadata chargeej par kharchabadha diya he
 It is true that many of us use an unlimited data plan for this, but one truth is that after a few GB our 3G data plan converts to dial-up speed
 yani speed banaae rakhana he to data bachaane kii jugat yahaan bhi jaruri he
 Although another way to cut the cost is to connect to the wi-fi network as soon as it is available, but it also becomes a little impossible and insecure in the order of moving from here to there throughout the day
 jabaki kuch aise upaay hai, jinhen apanaakar aap apane data kharch main katautee kar sakate hai
 Obviously, once this happens, your positive effect on your mobile will also start showing
 1)sabase pehle apane smartphone main un saare App ko Uninstall karen, jinka aap istemaal nahin karte
 Because often the app updates and they spend inexplicable data
 2)agar aap App Uninstall nahin karnaa chaahate hai to Settings main jaakar iske auto apadet ko of yaa disable kar den
 For this you can also use programs like App Manager
 3)gairajaruri apadet notification ko Ignore karnaa seekhen
 Not every update has to be installed
 haa, OS se sambandhit apadats ko jarur install karen
 This increases the performance of the phone
 4)agar aap youtube par video aplod karte hai to phone kii bajaae pisi se aplod karen
 These days, generally, every good smartphone has an HD camera
 aise main ek chota HD video bhi 200MB ke baraabar sies kaa hota he
 Whereas instead of uploading it immediately from the phone, it can also be avoided
 5)whatrup or vibar jaise App kaa istemaal karte hai to doston dwaara bheje jane vaale har video ko downlod karne se bachein
 Be a little vigilant in this regard and also check whether a friend has sent the related video before
 6)data kharch bachaana chaahate hai to video chat se bachein
 Admittedly, this is a new pastime and if you have taken a smartphone with 3G network, then the status is made, but what is it that everyone should make a video call
 7)video colling ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale do-teen App ko data kharch ke aadhaar par parakh len
 Many apps spend less data
 jabaki kai 3MB prati minute ke dar se data kharch kar aisi suvidha dete hai
 8) The trend of playing online games has increased these days
 isse bachein
 If you want to play the game then install it offline
 aam taur par online game khilne ke dauraan 1MB prati minute kii dar se data kharch hota he
 9) These days the trend towards online music streaming app has also increased by watching Ed on TV
 log dhadlle se Saavn, Hungama, Gaana
 Download the app like com and listen to the music you want
 lekin isse behatar hoga agar aap apane pasandida gaanon ko phone main downlod hi kar len
 10) Think of it in such a way that if a song is streaming at 320kbps bit rate, then this is your 2 every minute
 4MB data kharch kar rahaa he
 That is, if you listen to a song online for an hour, it costs 115MB of data
 11)mujeec strimming kii tarah hi youtube aadi website par live video strimming se bachein
 Normally a good quality video spends 50MB per minute of data during streaming
 jabaki ek ghanta HD vedia strimming main 3GB tak internet data kharch hota he

 Kolkata may be the center of attraction for Durga Puja celebrations, but the national capital is no less
 dilli main bhi puja samaaroh ke liye 350 se zyada pandal lagaae jate hai
 Not only this, the oldest worship of Delhi, Kashmiri Gate Durga Puja has been continuing this annual ritual for the last 108 years
 iskaa vishay hameshaa se paaramparik rahaa he
 From maintaining the tradition of the sublime 'sabeki ek-chala-thakur' (traditional one stage) goddess Durga to carrying the idol of the goddess in a bullock cart for 'immersion', this puja stands out from all others
 dilli durga puja samiti ke ek sadsy samrendra bose ne bataaya ki baiylgaadee main visarjan kaa aayojan sirf hamaare dwaara hi kiya jaataa he
 No other pandal in the national capital organizes such a procession
 unhone kaha, 'or bhoga! hamaare mahotsav kaa yah bhi ek aakarshan he
 Every year in the afternoon we feed around five to six thousand people and on Ashtami this number increases to more than 10 thousand
 hamaare kandhon par yah ek badi jimmedaari he or ham yah sunishchit karte hai ki puja ke dauraan sab kuch thik se ho
 'there is a history associated with this worship
 ek agyaat railway karmchaaree ke prayaason ke kaaran, 1909 main nai sadak ke paas roshanpura kaali mandir main pehali puja kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha
 After that, from 1913 to 1946, worship was conducted in a Dharamshala (community hall) near Fatehpuri mosque
 baad main ise civil lines ke nikat alipur road par bengali senior secondary skool main sthanantarit kar diya gaya, lekin iskaa naam kabhi nahin badla gaya
 Bose said that in the early years, the idol was brought from Banaras, but since 1926 the idol began to be built in the city itself and now it is made in the school premises itself
 puja ke paanch dinon tak pandal ke bheetar ek chote bengal jaisaa maahaul hota he
 From people dressed in traditional costumes to cultural events and Bengal's favorite dish - Biryani, it is a center of attraction
 bose ne kaha ki ham saanskrithik kaaryakramon kaa aayojan karte hai, jinamein keval sthaneey nivasee hi bhaag lete hai
 We do not invite artists (as in most pandals)
 iske alaava, ham yah sunishchit karte hai ki kam se kam in paanch dinon ke dauraan sabhi samaaroh bengali main yojit kiye jaaen
 The attraction of this Durga Puja could not leave untouchable even then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who visited the pandal in 1969
 aisa mana jaataa he ki 1935 main netaji subhash chandra bose bhi is utsav main shaamil hue the
 Bose said that priests and drummers are called from Kolkata
 iske saath hi ham sunishchit karte hai ki bhoga kii kami na rahen
 After all, this Kashmiri Gate is a main attraction of Durga Puja
 isliye, is baar kashmiri get puja dekhne jarur jaaen

 chagan:hamaare aaropee jhuthe aarope lagaate hai court main farji piiel daalate hai
 There is media
 dam nahin he, par phirabhi dam lagaate rahete hai
 Tawde: Corruption is an important issue of this election
 rajya sarkaar policy paralysis kaa shikaar rahi he
 No matter how much they say that the allegations are false
 magar court or auditor general ne ungali uthaai he
 Chagan: 10 years ago he made allegations in Telgi scam
 maine istipha diya
 Vajpayee was the government
 sibiai ne jaanch kii
 My name did not even appear in the entire charge sheet
 magar meraa naam badnaam hota rahaa
 If you do, what to do? inkaa kaam ho jaataa he
 Tawde: Can you say with full force that there was no scam in irrigation
 bhujabal:mere naam main hi bal he
 Whatever i say, i say it with full force
 rahi vikaas kii baat, to kuch na kuch iljaam lag hi jate hai, kitna bhi kaam kar lo ab
 What will be the publicity issues, will Modi be the issue? Bhujbal: These days, due to his Modi sir, he is very strong
 inhen lagata he ki jo chamatkaar loksabhaa main hua
 Will show you by doing the same
 saaf he ki virdohi modi ji ke bare main bolenge
 When the budget of the railway arrived

 Why is everything connected to Gujarat? hamaare hira vyapaaree ko bolte hai ki surat main aao
 Love Jihad, now take this

 Tawde: Our government is going to be formed

 You are losing isliye sab naam gul hai
 Bhujbal: i want to say that Panth Pradhan, PM belongs to the whole country
 ekh rajya par focus na karen
 The farmers here are crying
 pyaaj kaa daam itnaa gir gaya he
 That the cost for the produce is not coming

 Tawde: Blessings of Chhatrapati

 Bhujbal: Modi ji is inaugurating nowadays

 So did all the work happen in such an interval? modi ji kehete the ki upie sarkaar ne paanch saal main kuch nahin kiya
 Then what are the ribbons cutting? taavade:aapane koyala ghotaalaa kiya
 Scammed 2G

 Tawde - what is this logic? kya bachapanaa he
 Your Home Minister is not working properly
 or tohamat piem modi ji par madh rahe hai
 Bhujbal - This party did the work of spreading riot in this country
 babari masjid ko shahid kiya
 You had gone to the forefront of demolishing the tawde-babri structure, along with Manohar Joshi
 aap tab shivasena main the
 Bhujbal - you are speaking incorrectly
 taavade-aap tab shivasena ke netaa the
 You said in the interview
 kaam maine kiya, shrey manohar joshi ko ja rahaa he
 Say this inako dikkat yahi thi
 That is why Bhujbal left Shiv Sena, my suggestion to BJP is that they should also include people from backward castes in the government
 ye log to munde sahab tak ko nahin le rahe the
 This was revealed in his tribute meeting himself
 taavade:ye jab bhi haar ke najadik jate hai to cast or communal card khelte hai
 That is why Marathi and Muslim are talking about reservation
 jab puure desh main vikaas kii baat chal rahi he, tab aap jati or dharm na ginaayen
 The younger generation of the country wants to see work
 maharashtra main bijli kaa sankat he
 It is a matter of unemployment
 magar ye abhi bhi cast kii baat kar rahe hai
 Bhujbal: See, these are Modi's people
 abhi wo chunaav main aayenge or kahenge ki hamaare gujarat main gaay to gaay bhainsen bhi doodh detii hai
 The BJP is excited and feels that Narendra Modi's wave will bring it to the throne of Delhi
 modi kii sena main aise navratna hai, jo unhen parde ke aage or peeche donon ore se jeet dilaane main jute hue hai
 The most important of these is Amit Shah
 kehete hai ki amit shah pehle vyakti the, jinhen modi ne raajnneeti main aane kii charchaa kii thi
 Today, through the same Amit Shah, he wants to win the largest state in the country
 pehla ratna: amit shahnarendra modi bijepi ke sabase bade chehre hai, pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar hai or is chunaav main sabase badi ummid bhi or hausala bhi
 But there is a mind behind Modi's face, named Amit Shah
 saal 2001 main jab narendra modi ne gujarat kii kaman sanbhali to unke sabase karibiyon main shaamil hue amit shah
 Belonging to a very rich and rich business family, Amit Shah took Modi's politics to a high level
 jab ye saaf ho gaya ki modi hi bijepi ke nae kshatradhari honge to modi ne sabase bada garh jeetne kaa jimmaa amit shah ko diya
 Modi, who was once a junior minister in his home ministry, not only made BJP the national general secretary of the BJP, but also made him in charge of Uttar Pradesh
 jab upi kaa prabhaar mila to amit shah ne ayodhya main ram mandir ke masale ko ek baar phir se uchhaala
 Of course, the issue of the temple was raised, but when there was no enthusiasm among the public nor from within the organization, Amit Shah slowly left behind the name of Ram and his leader came on Modi's line
 gujarat main vikaas ke daawey par, desh main vikaas ke vaade par
 Modi is aggressive, attacks straight away, but Amit Shah is soft-spoken despite Modi being aware of everything
 unki jubaan se unki raajnneeti ke raste kaa paimaana pataa nahin chalata
 Modi has politics in Amit's mind but he has a mother at heart, whom he loves the most
 doosraa ratna: rajnath singhbijapi ke nath yani rajnath singh
 He is also a Navratna of Modi
 party ke ek dhade ke tikhe virodh ke baavjood rajnath ne naa sirf modi ko pehle prachaar abhiyaan kaa pramukh banaaya balki baad main pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar bhi
 The importance of Rajnath can be gauged from the fact that Modi with whom he is directly on the hot line is Rajnath
 atal-adwani kaa daur nepathy main chalaa gaya or manch par prakat hue narendra modi or rajnath singh
 This is the new pair of BJP with changing times
 aresas to dobaaraa nitin gadakari ko hi bijepi kaa adhyaksh banvaanaa chahta tha
 But on one occasion Rajivalka was exiled
 ittefaq se 2009 ke baad 2014 main bhi bijepi unki hi adhyakshata main loksabhaa chunaav main utari
 This time Narendra Modi was claiming the candidature for the post of Prime Minister
 rajnath ne mauka dekha or modi ke naam kaa chaukaa laga diya
 Wherever obstacles arose in the name of Modi, Rajnath came to the forefront to remove that stone on the way
 kehete hai ki varanasi se modi ko ladaane kii ranneeti rajnath singh kii thi, taaki uttar pradesh or bihar donon ko ek saath saadhaa ja sake
 Not only this, Modi took over Varanasi and Rajnath took Lucknow
 vaajapeyi kii seat se chunavi maidan main utarkar rajnath ye ishaara kar rahe the ki aaj kii bijepi main vaajapeyi kii raajnneeti ke sabase kareeb vahi hai
 Rajnath Singh started his politics in 1977 by becoming an MLA
 baad main wo uttar pradesh sarkaar main mantri bane, phir mukhyamantri or centre main mantri bhi
 Twice became the party's national president and is now joining Modi's Navratnas and hears the call for a new role
 teesraa ratna: arun jetaliarun jetali vaajapeyi sarkaar main kanoon mantri rahe hai
 He knows the law very well and continues to give legal advice to Modi on many complex issues
 lekin in sabase zyada donon kaa rishta bahut purana he
 When the wind blew, there was a voice from every corner of the BJP that Modi
 lekin bahut pehle hi modi kii takat ko jinhone bhaanp liya tha, unka naam he arun jetali
 It is known to very few people that Jaitley was instrumental in taking forward Narendra Modi's name when Keshubhai Patel was removed and a new Chief Minister was being sought in Gujarat
 itnaa hi nahin, gujarat dangon ke baad bhi adwani ke saath jisane modi ko bachaane main apni takat jhonki, unamem jetali bhi the
 Jaitley, who has inherited the legal profession, is contesting for the first time - the Lok Sabha election from Amritsar
 abivipi se judkar dilli uniwarsity main chaatrasangh kii raajnneeti kii, adhyaksh bhi bane
 Joined BJP in 1991
 modi ke liye har morche par vakaalat karne vaale jetali unke bahut puraane dost hai
 The same friendship is now shining like Kohinoor
 chauthaa ratna: ram madhakub ek cheharaa sangh ke andar se, naam he ram madhav
 Ram Madhav did engineering but within the Sangh Parivar he has always been doing political engineering for Narendra Modi
 saarvajanik manch par shaayad hi kabhi dekha ho aapane bijepi ke piem candidate or aresas ke rashtriya pravaktaa ko
 But 49-year-old Ram Madhav is counted among 64-year-old Narendra Modi's Navratnas
 modi ram madhav se puraane sanghasevak rahe hai
 Modi's dedication to the Sangh is also well known
 modi or madhav ke vaicharik mail kii kahani 2003 se shuru hoti he jab electrical ejineering ke chaatr ram madhav ko sangh kaa rashtriya pravaktaa niyukt gaya
 Modi then became the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 dange ke baad modi ke saath tamaam vivaad jude, lekin modi ko lekar ram madhav kaa vishwaas atoot rahaa
 Faith is not just the test of Hinduism, but also the ability to stand firm against all the storms of controversy
 aaj sangh modi ke sang he, to iske peeche ram madhav kii badi bhoomika maani jaati he
 Ram Madhav has been associated with the Association of Journalists for 20 years
 10 kitabe likh chuke hai, sangh kii kai patr patrikaon ke editor rah chuke hai
 In such a situation, Madhav's words in favor of Modi had to be frozen
 paanchavaa ratna: nitin gadakarijinase khatra rahata he, wo bhi kaise kareeb ho sakate hai, isaki ek misaal hai nitin gadakari
 It is believed that Gadkari's brilliant work as a minister in Maharashtra and his atmosphere created in Modi's favor could give him a bigger role
 2009 main nagpur kaa ishaara mila to tamaam bade bado kii ummiido ko dhul main mitaate hue nitin gadakari ne maharashtra se sidhe dilli kii raajnneeti main entry laga di
 Unlike others, it was not easy for Nitin Gadkari to join Modi's Navratna
 gadakari ke party adhyaksh rahete modi se unke takaraav ke kai maamle saamne aae
 It even goes so far as to say that Modi was not in favor of getting Gadkari back as president because he felt that Gadkari could become a stone in the way of his candidature for the Prime Minister's post
 jab modi ko bijepi ne pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya, tab ye khabar bahut teji se faili ki gadakari ne modi ko ek haar uphaar main diya he
 It is now believed that if there is a garland of victory in Modi's neck, Gadkari will be seen in a big role
 chatha ratna: susheel kumaar modigin navratnon se modi kaa darbar sajaa hua he, usamen ek ratna bihar ke purv up mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi bhi hai
 He was earlier considered close to Nitish Kumar
 lekin gathbandhan tutaa to narendra modi ke paksh main sabase badhachadhakar susheel kumaar modi aa gaye
 There is an image of a skilled administrator and Narendra Modi likes such people very much
 modi jahaan bhi jate hai, bihar kii har raily main unke manch par susheel modi shobhaa badhaate dikhte hai
 Sushil has a tremendous influence in the politics of Bihar
 jepi andolan ne inhen raajnneeti main laayaa to sangh kii sangat main ye samajasevi bane
 He created an atmosphere for BJP in Bihar and also played a big role in alliance with JDU
 8 saal tak bihar ke vitt or up mukhyamantri rahe
 In July 2011, Sushil Modi became the Chairman of the State Finance Minister's Committee, whose job is to work on Goods and Sales Tax
 saatvaan ratna: smriti iraninarendra modi kii aguwai main bijepi kii jeet ke liye party ke tamaam bade chote netaa ji-jaan se lage hai
 But Smriti Irani is the leader who gave the idea of 'namo Tea' when she came out of the glow of small screen in the rough field of politics
 modi kii chhavi chamakaane main ji jaan se lagi hai
 Smriti Irani, daughter-in-law of the small screen, came to play a big role in politics
 das saal baad wo mauka aa bhi gaya he, jab congress ke duusare sabase bade netaa rahul gandhi ke khilaaf unhen chunaav ladane kaa mauka mila
 But even more important than this occasion is that Smriti is one of the people closest to the bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi to this day
 india shining ke feel good ke saath smriti irani das saal pehle raajnneeti main ai thim
 The BJP then contested them against Congress's Kapil Sibal in Chandni Chowk but the glare of the camera could not win the hearts of the voters
 us haar se bhi badi baat ye thi ki smriti ne modi kii mukhaalafat kii thi
 Irani even sought Modi's resignation over the Gujarat riots
 ab unke naam par vot maang rahi hai
 Smriti Irani, who worked in a food and drink company, also took part in the Miss India competition
 kismat ne chote parade par pahunchaaya or raajnneetik sooyeeboojh ne sansad main
 The Modi who had even sought his resignation, he sent him to the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat
 aathvaan ratna: piyush goyalnarendra modi ke ek navratna hai piyush goyal
 BJP is treasurer
 inke pita bhi bijepi ke khajaanji hi hote the
 Smriti Irani gave the idea while Goyal successfully organized the Namo Tea
 goyal hi soshal media kaa bhi kaam kaaj dekhte hai
 Modi's air in the country rose, the election height increased, the name Modi became the political brand of the party
 iske peeche mani management saaf dikhataa he
 From air travel to grand rallies and the entire campaign, Piyush Goyal has the mind behind Modi in this money game
 49 saal ke piyush goyal rajya sabha saansad hai
 But the active role in the BJP is that of Treasurer, Khajanchi
 piyush goyal desh ke jane maane or rank holder chartered accountint bhi rahe hai
 Khajanchi's role in the BJP has earned him a political legacy
 nauvaan ratna: saurav patebgar bijepi jeet gai or narendra modi dilli aa gaye to gujarat kaa mukhyamantri koun ban saktaa he
 One can also name Sourav Patel, who is one of Modi's Navratnas
 behad padhe likhe or vikaas kii raajnneeti karne vaale saurav patel kaarobaar kii baarikiyon ko bhi bahut achche se jaanate hai or isiilie wo modi ke chahete hai
 He is the same Saurav Patel who is counted among the most powerful ministers in the Modi cabinet and yes, he is the same Saurav Patel, whose name Arvind Kejriwal repeatedly targeted Modi
 lagaataar chauthi baar vidhansabha main pahunchane vaale patel modi sarkaar ke sabase zyada padhe likhe mantri hai
 Patel, who holds an MBA from the US, holds important ministries like energy, petrochemical, mining, cottage industries, salt industry, planning, tourism, civil aviation, labor and employment
 narmada canal par asia kaa sabase bada solar energy power plant banane kaa shrey bhi patel ko hi jaataa he
 Patel does not remain in the headlines
 wo parade ke peeche gujarat kii apni simit duniya main kaam karte hai
 But due to his developing policy, it is believed that if Modi gets the crown of Delhi, then he can hand over to Gandhinagar Patel

 jiesti conklev ke tisare satr india trist vid tex main vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki jiesti desh hit main ek bahut bada sudhaar he lihaaja, jo log isamen shaamil nahin ho rahe hai vah peeche chhot rahe hai kyonki yah kaaravaan ab aage hi badhegaa
 The session was moderated by India Today TV Managing Editor Rahul Kanwal
 arun jetali ne kaha ki sab kuch centre ne tay nahin kiya he, ise 31 rajya sarkaron or centre sarkaar ne saath main har faisla kiya he
 We have recordings of all council meetings
 hamane har vishay par sarvasammati se faisla liya
 So i have told all the opposition parties that you have supported this everywhere, should have joined the celebration
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne congress or vampanthi partiyon se maal evam sevakar jiesti pranali ke udghaatan kaarykram kaa bahishkaar karne ke faisle par phir se vichaar karne kii apil kii he
 Jaitley has said that the GST is the result of joint efforts of all of them and they can no longer stand apart from it
 haalanki yadi koi party iske virodh main amaadaa he to unhen yah samajhnaa chahie ki ab yah kaaravaan rukegaa nahin or kendra sarkaar safalataa purvak desh kaa nayaa dhaancha lagu karegi
 Rahul Kanwal questioned the Finance Minister on the preparation of GST and asked why the matter is arising that the Central Government is going to implement GST with half-baked preparations
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki aam dharna yah he ki kisi desh main aarthik badlaav yaa sudhaar main hameshaa nijee kshetra aage rahata he
 But this is happening for the first time that more than the preparation of the private sector, the central government and the state governments have prepared
 lihaaja jetali ne vipakshi dalon se kaha ki vah is maamle main jimmedaarana ravaiya apanaate huye aage aayen
 He cannot separate himself from such decisions in which he has been a partner
 jetali ne kaha kii jiesti desh kii aazaadee ke baad hone vaala sabase bada kar sudhaar he
 In the GST preparation, the government Avvarrahul Kanwal asked Jaitley if the government had prepared to take lessons from the countries of the world which implemented GST before India
 sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue jetali ne kaha ki duniya ke baaki deshon main jiesti kii shuruyaat or bharat main ek bada mul antar he
 In all the countries which implemented GST before India, common citizens and businessmen pay their tax
 vahiin bharat main tex ke liye ravaiya lachar he or tex chori bahut bada mudda he
 Essentially, the habit of paying tax said that GST will contain more than a dozen central and state level taxes
 iske lagu hone se puraa desh ek saajha bazaar ban jaayegaa
 Jaitley said that only 80 lakh people in the country pay indirect tax
 vahiin canada or australia main tex adaa karne waalon kii sankhya bahut acchhee he
 Therefore, the biggest benefit of GST would be that with the help of information technology, it will help to completely curb tax evasion in the country and there will be a good increase in tax base
 kashmir main upabhokta ko hoga bada nuksanvitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki jammu kashmir ek maatr rajya he jisane abhi tak apana kanoon taiyaar nahin kiya he
 However, he is moving towards passing the law
 jetali ke mutabik kashmir main sarkaar ke saath-saath vipaksh or aam aadmi ko yah samajhnaa chahie ki jiesti main peeche chhot jane par unke liye gambhir chunauti khadi ho jaaegi
 In Kashmir, tax has to be paid twice to carry a product
 pehla, jiesti hoga or doosraa rajya kaa apana tex
 Because of this, you can guess the price for the consumer
 vahiin jammu-kashmir main banane vaale product desh ke baaki hisson main pahunchane ke liye bhi do baar tex adaa karnaa hoga
 Therefore, Jammu and Kashmir should also complete preparations to implement GST at the earliest
 is satr ke dauraan ajtak samvaadadaata ashok singhl ne vitt mantri se jaananaa chaha ki is tex riform kaa sabase bada phayda kise hone ja rahaa he or kya kendra sarkaar launch ke maukey par vipaksh ko saath lene main vifal ho gai he? sawaal ke jawaab main vitt mantri arun jetali kaa maananaa he ki jiesti se chaahe vah vyapaaree ho, aam aadmi ho, sab ko phayda hoga
 Therefore, the misconceptions that people have about this should be removed
 jetali ke mutabik sarkaar puri koshish kar rahi he ki kaarobaari kii sabhi ashankaon ko dur kiya jayega
 Jaitley argued that along with the central government, all state governments in the country have been preparing to implement GST for several days
 vahiin vipaksh dwaara virodh ke mudde par vitt mantri ne ek baar phir apil kii ki is maukey par sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko vishesh satr main maujuud rahanaa chahie

 In palmistry, the state of happiness is seen with the color of the palms
 iske alaava aapkaa mastak bhi sukh ke bare main bataata he
 Health Happiness- For this, the Moon and the lord of the Ascendant are responsible - a person's health is good when the Moon is strong - If the Moon is weak but Jupiter is good, then it gives happiness to health as well - Rahu is bad But there is a problem in most health - despite good health, the person is prey to anxiety - due to Saturn, there is a difficulty in getting health happiness for a long time
 There are ways to get health happiness - Stop Monday fast, Worship Shiva ji - Donate food or food every Saturday - Wear the gemstone of the Lord of your horoscope ascendant - Dunk your head in water and keep some grass in it - Touch the feet of parents every morning and the happiness of employment and employment- The pleasure of employment is either met by Saturn or by Jupiter - if either one is strong then employment cannot be a problem - if both are weak then you have to stumble for employment
 Minister not only is hire on Sat breakdowns, Stability does not come
 - When Jupiter is spoiled, a person loses his job for employment
 The remedy to get employment and employment pleasure- Chant the eternal evening Shani Mantra - Apply white sandalwood tilak on the forehead - One iron ring in the middle finger Wear - Keep the cleanliness in the kitchen completely - Eat black gram on Saturday: Marriage and happiness of marital life - Jupiter responsible for women's marriage happiness Dota - Chandra and Venus are responsible for the marital happiness of men - Overall marital happiness is controlled by Venus - The biggest hindrance in marital happiness comes from the deterioration of Venus and Mars - Also if Jupiter is disturbed
 Marriage does not take place - Always mix turmeric in the morning and offer water - recite Vishnu Sahasranama every Thursday - Banana root in yellow thread Wear it - make a swastika with turmeric on Thursday at the main entrance of the house - where anil ambani ke swaamitv vaali raksha kshetra kii company reliance dephence ne kaha he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke hamale par kaha he ki vah jis i-mail kaa zikr kar rahe hai, vah rafel deal se sambandhit nahin he

 -input bhashaa Bala Saheb Thackeray's will has come to light, in which he has given most of his assets to Uddhav Thackeray and did not give anything to his second son Jaydev Thackeray
 jayadev thakare ne is vasiyat kii pramanikta par hi sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Jaidev says that his father was not in a condition to sign at the time the will is being written
 is maheene ke aakhri saptaah main bombai hoicourt is maamle par sunwaayee karegaa
 The tussle in the Thackeray family over Balasaheb's property has come to the fore
 unke bete sampatti ke liye lard rahe hai or bombai hoicourt pahunch gaye hai
 According to Uddhav Thackeray, Bala Saheb made a will in December 2011, almost a year before his death
 kya he bala sahib kii vasiyat menmatoshri kaa ground floor party ke kaam ke liye rakhaa he
 The first storey of the bungalow has been given to Aishwarya, son of Smita Thackeray and Jaydev Thackeray, although Smita Thackeray and Jaydev Thackeray have not been allowed to live there
 par is floor ke mentans kaa kharchaa smita ko uthaanaa padegabungale kaa sabase upree hissaa bal thakare ne apane bete uddhav thakare ke naam kiya he
 Apart from this, two properties of Karjat and Bhandaradhara have also been named after Uddhav
 bala sahib ke naam karodon kii propertiuddhav kii maane to bala sahib kii sari property or bank belans milakar takreeban 15 karod rupee kii jaaydaad he
 In the will, nothing has been given to the family of Banda Sahbe's late son Bindumadhav and another son Jaydev Thackeray
 is vasiyat ko pramanit karne ke liye uddhav or unase jude chaar or logon ne bombai hoicourt kaa rukh bala sahib ke guzarane ke ek maheene baad kiya tha
 But Uddhav's elder brother Jaydev Thackeray is opposed to this will
 jayadev kaa kahana he ki wo bhale hi apane pita se alag rah rahe the, lekin wo unke sampark main the or donon ke bich aksar baatcheet hoti thi
 Therefore, Balasaheb cannot evict them from their property
 jayadev ke anusaar, 'uddhav jis vasiyat kii baat kar rahe hai, wo us vakt banaai gai thi jab bala sahib gambhir bimariyon se jujh rahe the, aise main wo vasiyat par dastakht nahin kar sakate the
 Uddhav is declaring his assets less
 
 
 jayadev kaa daawa he ki uddhav sampatti ko kam karke bataa rahe hai
 The family had property, jewelry and bank deposits worth crores, which is not mentioned in the will
 matoshri kii keemat hi chalis karod se kam kii nahin hogi
 Also, the party's mouthpiece Saamna's office, the party's office, the Shiv Sena building should also be counted in the property
 bala sahib ke bade bete bindhumadhav kii maut ek road accident main barason pehle ho gai thi
 According to the will, 'balasaheb wanted to give Bindumadhav's son Nihar a floor of Matoshri, but he did not feel good to behave Bindumadhav's wife Madhavi and believed that living with both of them could disturb the peace of the family
 is
 'vasiyat ke mutabik uddhav ne jis tarah se bala sahib kii dekharekh or seva kii usase wo kaaphi khush the
 He was sure that Uddhav would keep the whole family together, that is why he gave all the property to Uddhav
 koun hai jayadev thakare
 
 
 Jaydev Thackeray stood shoulder to shoulder with his brother Uddhav during the last rites of Balasaheb Thackeray in November last year
 lekin pita-putr ke rishte hameshaa utaar chadhaav vaale rahe
 Jaidev was rebellious from the beginning
 kai muddon par unki pita se patari nahin khaati thi
 Initially, Jaidev was emerging as an artist, just like his father
 jayadev ne teen shaadiyaan kii thi
 The first marriage to Jayshree Kalekar and the second marriage to Smita Thackeray, but both of them did not last
 smita se apni shaadi tuutane par jayadev kaa kahana tha smita bahut zyada mahatvakankshi mahila thi or isaki vajah se un donon ke bich kaaphi jhagade hote the
 Meanwhile, Jaydev left Matoshree but the thing that struck him the most was that Smita did not leave Matoshree and stay with him
 iske baad jayadev ne teesri shaadi anuraadhaa ke saath kii or matoshri ke paas hi ek ghar le kar rahane lage
 In his will, Bal Thackeray wrote that 'jaidev is a great boy
 lekin jis tarah se usne matoshri choda, apni patni ko chhod kar doosraa ghar basaaya, is sabase mujhe bahut dukh hua
 That is why i have decided not to give him any part of my property
 'jayadev kaa bagipan
 
 
 Jaidev's rebellion also took him to the doors of different parties
 kuch hi maheene pehle jab shivasena shivaji park main bala sahib kii murti lagane kii maang kar rahi thi, tab jayadev ne iskaa virodh bhi kiya tha or kaha tha kii shivaji park main sirf shivaji kaa putala hona chahie
 In Bala Saheb's will, only Aishwarya, one of the two sons Rahul and Aishwarya of Jaidev and Smita Thackeray, has been given a floor in Matoshree
 is vasiyat kii sachai par etraj jataate hue jayadev thakare ne kaha he ki 'bala sahib thakare ne sari jindagi marathi logon or marathi bhashaa ke utthan ke liye kaam kiya
 So how can his will be written in English language
 ' jayadev kaa kahana he ki teenon beton ke bich sampatti kaa bantwaaraa baraabar hona chahie
 Political parties have started raising questions about the property after the family's discord was exposed
