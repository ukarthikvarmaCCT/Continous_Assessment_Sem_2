 Will live in a small place
 mantri se lekar saansad bhi saamaanya gharon main rahete hue janata kii seva karenge
 The emphasis of Imran's speech is that he will reduce the government's expenses which are made in the name of protocol
 jo shahi shaan shaukat ke liye kiye jate hai

 yah sab baaten acchhee lagati hai sunne main
 Nowadays, it is customary, the public also believes, but overall there is not a very concrete result
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki netaa ko saadagi se nahin rahanaa chahie magar uski kuch zaruuratein hoti hai wo to hona hi chahie
 Wherever you are, the public should see whether his life is changing because of your policies
 kya imran khan naujavaanon ko rojgaar de paaenge, unki baton se koi khaas or nayaa formula to nahin dikhaa, zarur sunne main acha laga, kyonki aisi baaten hameshaa sunne main acchhee lagati he
 Imran Khan is being called the puppet of the army
 ve thos pramaan dene par jaanch kii baat bhi kar rahe hai
 In his address, Imran has emphasized poverty and governance
 ve maanav suchakank main sudhaar kii baat karte hai
 It is good that a leader underlines all these things and it is even better when he really does something
 sanyukt raashtra kii report ke anusaar pakistan kii aabaadi kaa 39 fisadi hissaa garibi main jeeta he
 Pata and Balochistan have the highest poverty
 imran ne apni baat kii shuruyaat main baluchistan ke logon kaa shukriya adaa kiya ki aatankwaadi hamale ke baad bhi vahaan ke log vot dene ke liye nikle
 We also want to establish Pakistan as an investment friendly country
 nivesh priy mulk banane kaa formula bhi vahi he jo sabake paas he
 If we look closely, no one has a new idea
 sabake paas vahi bate hai ki nivesh aayega to rojgaar aayega, videshon main rahane vaale pakistani apane desh main or bhartiya apane desh main nivesh karenge
 It is better to see in India also how much percentage of foreign investment happens to Indians living outside it and Pakistan should also do the same
 yah bataane kaa makasad yah he ki kya nivesh is aadhaar par aata he yaa phir nivesh karne vaale khilaadi kuch or hote hai, jinke liye maidan enarai ke naam par kholaa jaataa he
 24 in 2015-16 as per Economic Survey of Pakistan 2017-18
 3 pratishat log garibi rekha ke neeche hai
 50 in 2005–06
 4 pratishat log garibi rekha ke neeche hai
 In ten years, Pakistan has reduced poverty by 50 percent
 pehle chah karod log garib the, ab paanch karod bataae jate hai
 Even after this, Imran was giving the example of China in the matter of removing poverty
 imran khan ne aatankwaad ko lekar ek shabd nahin kaha
 Did not even mention how Pakistan will deal with terrorism
 kattarpanthi takatein bhale chunaav main haari hai magar un par kaise lagaam lagayegaa kuch nahin kaha
 Neither the role of the army in Imran's Pakistan or the role of Imran in the army of Pakistan, neither stated clearly or said in gestures
 imran khan ne apni sarkaar kii videsh niti kaa khaakaa bhi khinchaa
 In his talks, India came in last
 pehle china aayaa, phir afghanistan, phir america aayaa, phir iran, phir madhya purv tab jaakar bharat
 What can be a better thing than simplicity in power and come anywhere, but can Imran really change the Pakistan that has witnessed many bomb blasts during election campaign and many people have lost their lives
 bharat ke bare main baat karte hue kaha ki is upmahadweep ke liye behatar he ki bharat or pakistan dost bane rahen
 Sit on a table and talk on Kashmir
 agar hindustan kii leadership taiyaar he, ek kadam aage badhegi to ham do kadam badhenge
 Here a line has been said about the army that there are no issues with the army
 to kya ve apni sena ko bhi yahi baat kah rahe hai
 It is not clear from Imran's words
 imran khan 1 karod logon ko rojgaar dene kaa or 50 lakh sasta ghar dene kaa vaada kar satta main aae hai
 The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Pakistan report in May this year also gives some more idea about Pakistan
 aabaadi kaa 64 pratishat 30 saal se kam kaa he
 29 percent of the population is between 15 and 29 years old
 duniya kaa sabase jawan mulk he
 This report says that Pakistan will take 60 years to educate all children according to the speed at which admission is being done in schools
 pakistan ke aarthik survey ke hisaab se waha sakshartaa dar 60 pratishat se ghatakar 58 pratishat ho gai he
 Because he does not have enough money for education
 pakistan duniya ke un 15 deshon main se ek he jo shiksha par sabase kam karch karata he
 Pakistan's energy and transport sector is referred to China
 china kaa is sector main bahut nivesh he
 GDP of Pakistan 5
 7 pratishat ke paas he, vahaan ke media main ise saat pratishat tak le jane kii baat hoti rahati he magar vishwa bank ne kaha he ki 2019 main 5
 Will be reduced from 9 percent to 5 percent
 tippaniyan The Dawn newspaper was reading an article by Munir Akram, former Pakistan Ambassador
 isamen kheti ke bare main zikr mila
 Imran Khan has also talked about poor farmers, but in a row, agriculture's share of Pakistan's GDP is 25 percent
 pakistan kii shram shakti kaa 40 pratishat kheti main he
 It claims to have the world's largest irrigation system
 iske baad bhi laagat kii tulana main utpaadan duniya main sabase kam he
 Therefore, there is a need for considerable improvement in the farming of Pakistan
 ham pakistan ko lagaataar ek hi frem main dekhte or jaanate aae hai, magar ek mulk ko dekhne samajhane ke liye kaaphi nahin he
 In 2014, The Dawn was watching a newspaper report that 50 percent of girls who passed MBBS from a medical college in Pakistan never practice
 pakistan main har saal 14,000 doctor banate hai, jinamein se 70 fisadi mahilaayein hoti hai
 Now think if half of these women do not practice then what will happen there? duniya main sabase adhik navjaat shishu kii maut pakistan main hoti he
 Afghanistan is at number two
 pakistan ke neshnal neutrishan survey ke mutabik 45 pratishat bachche paushtik aahaar na milane ke kaaran kamazor hai
 Their length does not increase
 is nazar se bhi pakistan ko dekhie kai samasyaon ke bare main bharat jaisaa lagegaa
 In terms of ranking of media freedom, India and Pakistan are side by side as true neighbors
 bharat 138wein number par he or pakistan 139 wein number par
 We also want to establish Pakistan as an investment friendly country
 nivesh priy mulk banane kaa formula bhi vahi he jo sabake paas he
 If we look closely, no one has a new idea

 Calling Bharatiya Janata Party's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi a 'messenger of development' rather than 'symbol of fear', BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi claimed not to do justice to the Muslim community in the ticket distribution for the upcoming Lok Sabha election

 The ICC today decided to convert the Champions Trophy to be held in India in the World T20 in 2021, and thus finally the tournament between the eight teams was ended in a way, the relevance of which was constantly questioned

 Richardson's announcement meant that BCCI representative Amitabh Chaudhary also supported the move
 shuru main bisisiai ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 This means that the ICC World T20 tournament will be held in two consecutive years
 australia 2020 main world tii-20 kii mejabani karegaa
 This is the second time this will happen
 isse pehle 2009 (england) or 2010 (westeindies) main lagaataar varshon main isisi tii-20 kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha
 ICC released World Cup 2019 schedule, know when and when the matches will be played, Richardson said, 'the Champions Trophy to be held in India in 2021 has been changed to World T20
 yah khel ko aage badhaane kii hamaari yojana main feet baithta he
 'meanwhile 2019 and 2023 will be the World Cup and thus the Champions Trophy was lifted
 is toornament ko kai aalochak apraasangik maan rahe the, jabaki har chaal saal main world cap kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 Richardson said, 'the BCCI representative attended the board meeting and it was unanimously decided

 ' yuva netritv laane kii pairokari kar rahe rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne ab bhartiya janata party ke sheersh netaa laalkrishna adwani par hallaa bolte hue bhaajapa kii haar ke liye unhen jimmedaar bataaya he
 The Sangh, which is pressurizing the BJP to end the infighting and bring forward the youth leadership, believes that presenting Advani as the future Prime Minister and making the entire election campaign focused on Advani was a huge political mistake
 bhaajapa kii bhul kaa congress ne uthaaya phaaydasangh ke mukh patr ‘panchajnya’ ke taaja ank ke ek lekh main yah baat badi safagoi se likhi gayi he ki adwani or bhaajapa kii is ranneetik bhul kaa congress ne ‘‘badi chaturata se sonia or rahul ko satta kii daud se baahar karke apane liye tyagamurti kii chhavi arjeet kar lee jabaki adwani ke lambey raajnneetik anubhav ke bajaae unki umr ko uchhaalkar ‘budhaape banaam yuva peedi’ ko chunaav kaa mukhya mudda bana diya
 "senior member and thinker of the Sangh, Devendra Swaroop, has said in this," Seeing the manner in which the Sonia party used Manmohan Singh against Advani, the context of erecting Shikhandi in front of Bhishma Pitamah is recalled
 ’’'adwani khud ko niyati purush samajhane lage the'adwani ko aade haath lete hue lekh main kaha gaya ki unhone apni aatmakatha kaa vibhinn bhashaaon or desh ke anek nagaron main jitani dhoomdhaam ke saath lokaparn karaayaa, usase abhas hota he ki vah swayan ko ‘‘bhartiya raajnneeti ke niyati purush ’’ ke rup main dekhne lage the
 According to Panchajanya, "but he had forgotten that all this would backfire and the Sangh Parivar worker would not forget his image of Jinnah Bhakta and would fall into the trap of nationalist versus consciousness 'youth versus old age' and Rahul Kandhar's We will use the shameful episode to puncture bjp's patriotism
 ’’‘loktantr banaam vanshavaad’ hona chahie tha chunavi muddisamen kaha gaya adwani ke man main yah bhav utpann hona aswabhaavik nahin he ki vaajapeyi ke baad unhen hi is riktata ko puraa karnaa he
 "in this situation, some of Advani's advisers would have advised him to follow Atalji and adopt a liberal image, and perhaps it was from this thinking that the statement made by Jinnah during his visit to Pakistan would have come out
 lekh main kaha gaya ki bhaajapa ne yadi ‘loktantr banaam vanshavaad’ ko apane chunaav abhiyaan kaa mukhya mudda banaaya hota to ‘yuva banaam budhaape’ kaa mudda naa ubhar paata
 Sonia and Rahul did not dominate the media
 isamen bhaajapa kii soch par bhi prahaar karte hue kaha gaya ki jansangh naam chhod kar 1980 main nae naam, dhvaj or saiddhanthik aavaran ke parivartan se hi spasht ho gaya tha ki jansangh se aayaa netritv ab satta paane kii jaldi main he

 Most of these people are ignorant who have suspended the use of common sense
 But its disconcerting that educated privileged people are cheering on at the prospect of a war

 How can yesterday's mourners become cheerleaders of today's violence? This war-mongering, glorification of violence, arguments for necessity of violence for political ends, false distinctions between state and non-state violence, are all against the basic values of humanity
 ek anya twit main unhone kaha ki 45 jindagiyon ke khatm hone ke saath hi kai parivaar barbaad ho gaye
 After this, targeted attacks against thousands of Kashmiris, communal polarization, war between India and Pakistan, right wing forces likely to win elections, who will lose, who will win? Pulwama attack: 45 lives lost and as many families destroyed
 Targetted violence against thousands of Kashmiris
 Communal polarisation
 a near-war situation between India and Pak
 Possible electoral gains for RW forces in India
 Who lost and who gained? jem hit Indian forces & claimed the attack
 In turn Indian forces hit jem & owned that air strike
 It's now time for cooler heads to prevail
 War is never an ideal option to resolve disputes

 dilli vidhansabha chunaav main party kii karaari haarake baad bijepi ke kaddavar mukhyamantriyon main se ek raman singh ne party netritv ke faislon par sawaal uthaae hai
 The Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh told the English newspaper 'the Economic Times' that the party was in a state of disregard for the regional leadership of Delhi
 unhone kaha ki chunaav main kshetreey muddon kaa ahm role rahaa hoga, lekin ahm vajah yah thi ki dilli pradesh ke netritv ko aage nahin badhaayaa gaya
 He said, 'this is the biggest reason for poor performance in Delhi, but there are many reasons besides this
 chunaav main sthaneey masalon ko uthaaya ja saktaa tha
 Remember that about 25 days before polling, party president Amit Shah got Kiran Bedi, the first woman IPS officer of the country, to become BJP candidate and made her the chief ministerial candidate within 48 hours
 10 farvari ko jab dilli chunaav ke nattejey aae to bijepi sirf teen siton par simat gai or kiran bedi khud krishnanagar se chunaav haar gayi
 Asked about the impact of Delhi election results on national politics, he said, 'I don't think this will have any impact on national politics as the AAP is limited to Delhi and has to do a lot to make them a base in other parts of the country
 Will happen
 ' Assembly elections are due in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Mizoram
 jab se bhartiya janata party (bijepi) adhyaksh amit shah,biharke mukhyamantri or jediu adhyaksh nitish kumaar ne ghoshnaa kii he ki donon dal loksabhaa chunaav main samaan siton paar chunaav ladenge tab se bihar kii raajnneeti main khalabali much hui he
 Amit Shah also said that the remaining two NDK allies in Bihar will also be given respectable seats
 nitish kumaar auchhamit shaahaki seat bantwaare kii ghoshnaa ke baad rashtriya lok samta party (araspi)upendra kushvaahane naaraazgi ke chalate argedy netaa tejasvi yadav se mulaakaat kii thi
 During this time the two leaders discussed the Lok Sabha elections and the politics of Bihar
 siton par upendra kushvaha kaa daawakendriya mantri aurarelaspdhyaksh upendra kushvaha ne bihar bijepi ke prabharee or party mahasachiv se bihar main seat shering par baat kii
 According to sources, Upendra Kushwaha told Bhupendra Yadav that his party had won three seats in the alliance in 2014 on which the party won
 upendra kushvaha ne ye bhi kaha ki 2014 ke baad pichley saadhe chaar saalon main unki party kaa janaadhar na sirf bihar main badha he balki desh ke anya kai rajyon main bhi uskaa asar badha he
 He therefore wants three seats for his party in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi kaa javaabavahin bhupendra yadav ne kaha ki bihar main endie main jediu bhi nae ghatak dal ke taur par judaa he
 In such a situation, all the allies will have to lose some seats for JDU
 matlab saafe he ki sabko 2014 kii tulana main 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kam siton par chunaav ladanaa padegaa
 In response to this, Upendra Kushwaha said that it is fine that if no one comes a new constituent party, then everyone gets a little damage, but when there is a benefit, everyone should get it
 magar jab bihar main endie ko phayda mila to unki party ko iskaa laabh nahin mila
 It is clear that Upendra Kushwaha said in gestures that BJP and LJP were included in the cabinet of NDA under Bihar under Nitish Kumar, but his party was excluded
 sutron kii maane to ab upendra kushvaha chaahate hai ki bihar main endie kii sarkaar banane ke baad unki party ko mantrimandal main shaamil nahin kiya gaya, uski bharpai loksabhaa chunaav main unhen teen siten dekar ho sakati he
 If sources are to be believed, the BJP may not be in the mood to give Upendra Kushwaha's party three seats
 lekin deepawali ke baad bihar main mantrimandal vistaar main unki party ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Tou dal-dal to i pat-pat strategy Till now the talks on seat sharing in Bihar have not been completed and Upendra Kushwaha has announced the names of his candidates in 66 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh
 saath hi yah bhi kaha he ki aane vaale dinon main madhya pradesh main kuch or ummidavaaron ke naam kii ghoshnaa karenge
 Upendra Kushwaha with the BJP, you are negotiating the strategy of the party

 Saudi attacked and we brought Indians and foreigners from Yemen
 aaj ke vakt main arab jagat ke saath sabase achche sambandh bharat ke hai
 Today Russia and America are with us

 Israel is a friend of India, but will not forget the Palestinians

 The Palestinians viewed our friendship with Israel as positive
 sushamaa kaa rahul gandhi par hamalasushamaa swaraj ne china par kaha ki vipaksh ke netaa unke rajdoot se kyon mili
 He said that the opposition should have understood India's approach first
 uske baad china ke rajdoot ko bulaakar kahana chahie tha ki hamaara ye paksh he
 However, the Leader of the Opposition heard his side from the Chinese Ambassador
 saath hi sushamaa ne china par bharat ke stand kii jaankaree di
 He said that bilateral talks are going on with China
 sushamaa ne kaha ki ab desh samrik kshamta nahin, aarthik kshamta se chalata he, isliye ise badhanaa chahie
 China has a major contribution to our economic capacity
 yuddh kisi samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin he
 What on Pakistan, Bolasushma said that the Prime Minister broke protocol and went to attend Nawaz Sharif's birthday
 ye hamaare sambandh kaa nazeer tha
 Sushma said that after Burhan Wani's encounter, the situation worsened when Nawaz Sharif described it as martyrdom in Pakistan
 sushamaa ne phir spasht kar diya hamaari sarkaar kaa rodmap ye he ki jis din aatank khatm ho jayega, pakistan se hamaari dosti sudhar jaaegi

 Explain that during the discussion on foreign policy, the Opposition had alleged that Sushma Swaraj is not allowed to work as Foreign Minister properly
 haalanki, sushamaa ne iskaa bhi jawaab diya or kaha ki videsh niti par piem modi mujhase hameshaa baat karte hai
 Nearly five months have passed since Duncan Fletcher's term ended but so far the BCCI has not been able to appoint a new coach for Team India
 haalanki sutara bataate hai ki khud team philhal nayaa coach nahin chaahati
 Team wants Shastri to question the matter, every time the BCCI removes the matter to the Cricket Advisory Committee and saves them
 lekin iske peeche kii asal vajah yah he ki khilaadiyon ne board se aagrah kiya he ki agle saal hone vaale tii-20 world cap tak ke liye ravi shastri ko sheersh pad par banaae rakhaa jaae
 Trimurti will elect the coach
 Let us tell you that BCCI has formed a three-member company with Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman to decide on the coach of Team India
 bisisiai ne beete ek june ko kaha tha ki ye teen lijend milakar team india ke agle mukhya coach kaa chunaav karenge
 But even after two months, this committee has not given away the names of the candidates of its choice even if it is to conduct elections
 tii-20 world cap ke baad ho saktaa he chunaavbisisiai ke ek senior adhikari ke mutabik jab tak bisisiai khilaadiyon ke saath qaraar tak nahin pahunch jaati tab tak nae coach kii ghoshnaa lagbhag asambhav he
 "our players want to see Ravi Shastri at the top post in all respects," the official told our daily newspaper Mail Today
 abhi kaa jo koching seoup he jisamen sanjay bangad, aar shridhar, or bharat arun ye teenon shastri kii dekh-rekh main kaam kar rahe hai
 In these circumstances, the possibility of a new name being announced as a coach is slim
 mujhe nahin lagata ki haal main aisa koi faisla aa saktaa he
 It may be that things change after the T20 World Cup and the coach is appointed
 'jald hogi cameti kii baithkgauratlab he ki bisisiai secretary anuraag thakur kai baar kah chuke he ki nae coach kii niyukti lagbhag kagaar par he or teen sadasyeey cameti jald hi milakar is maamle par koi faisla legi
 Thakur recently said, 'the three-member cricket committee consisting of big names Sachin, Ganguly and Laxman has been tasked to suggest the names of the appropriate people for the post of Chief Coach
 bisisiai unke suzav kaa intjaar karegi
 The current situation is that Ravi Shastri has charge of the team for the Sri Lanka series
 ham koching staff ke sambandh main aagaamee oktober main hone vaali dakshin africa siries se pehle ek baar jarur charchaa karenge
 Thakur further said, "if the cricket committee suggests the name of the coach, the board will take necessary steps moving forward on it
 tab tak ke liye team kaa jo seoup he vahi chalata rahegaa

 Vijender Gupta has expressed displeasure over lg's decisions and said that LG is ignoring the opposition while approving the Delhi government's unconstitutional decisions
 vipaksh ke netaa ne alji ke prati apana virodh jataayaa he or kaha he kidilli sarkaar nenium ke viruddh kaam karte hue tamaam mahatvapurn cametiyon main vipaksh ke vidhayakon kii niyukti nahin kii or alji ne bina is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhe tamaam filon ko manjuuri di he
 Leader of the Opposition Vijendra Gupta alleged that the shop is running in Delhi, not the government, in which Kejriwal is benefiting his workers
 jab is bare main hamane vijendra gupta se baat kii to unhone alji ko bhi nishane par liya or kaha ki alji dilli sarkaar kii filon ko bina dekhe-samajhe manjuur kar rahe hai

 aise main sawaal uthta he ki aakhir ye 40 lakh log koun hai, jinpar 'beghar' hone kaa khatra mandara rahaa he
 These 40 lakh people are those who could not complete the action of valid paper documents in NRC, due to which they have been declared illegal

 Ultimately, there was no talk between the government and the agitators and the agreement failed
 2005 main NRC ke liye samjhautasam main saamaajik or raajnneetik tanaav badhata chalaa gaya
 In 2005, the state and central government entered into an agreement to update the NRC list

 Wahindanik Jagran and India Today called it Amreli of Gujarat
 haalanki india today ne ise baad main sahi kar diya
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room found a link to the leopard attack in Nashik on the Internet and found that a man named Dhawal Khatiwala uploaded the same video to youtube on October 12 and wrote, "my dog lizzy was taken away by a leopard who 6 feet high compound wall came by hanging
 wo use 5 minute kii ladaai ke baad le gaya
 (video could not be captured on CCTV, only voice recorded
 ) wo ab nahin rahi
 
 
 'india Today anti-fake News War Room spoke to Dhawal's brother Malav, who said,' My house is on Shivkripa Bungalow, Barnes School Road in Devlali, near Malhari Baba Nagar

 The foundation of our relationship is very strong and tested over the years
 france pehla desh he jisase hamane (1998 main) ranneetik saajhedaari sthapit kii thi
 Our defense ties go back to the 1950s
 france hamen ucch kism kii raksha saamagree muhaiyaa karaata rahaa he
 These ties have been strengthened by the purchase of 6 Scorpene submarines and 36 Rafale aircraft, while proposals for joint development and production of light cargo helicopters, refueling aircraft, short-range missiles have not materialized
 mote taur par kahen to raksha kharid ke maamle main hamaari duvidha, nirantar badalati prakriya, raksha saudon main bhrashtachar kaa daag or sabase kam boli lagane vaale ko sauda dene kii masini prakriya se hamaari raksha saajhedaariyon ko majboot karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he

 Any progress will be made in the Jaitapur case during Macron's visit, it is difficult to say because the French nuclear industry is digested, delay in construction of EPR reactors in Finland and France as well as pending questions about the price, and most importantly the power per unit from the project There are issues of price of
 bharat or france ke bich antariksh saajhedaari main arianspes ke jariye hamaare sanchaar satellite kii lonching or france ke spot satelliton kii isro ke jariye lonching shaamil he
 In this way, our partnership with France in the strategic field is wider than other European countries, because no European country has the capability of France in terms of nuclear and space
 isliye france se kareebi rishta bharat kii rajnatik, suraksha or urja vikalpon ko vistaar detaa he
 The reverse is equally true
 bharat kaa vajan antarrashtriya maamalon main bad rahaa he or hamaari arthvyavastha ke sambhavit bade aakaar ke maddenjar france bharat ke saath saajhedaari majboot karke apane bhavishya ke hiton main nivesh kar rahaa he
 Of course, France has to compete with its European allies like America, Japan and Germany and Britain as they also want to increase their economic penetration in India
 bharat kaa raksha vyapaar bhi israel or america jaise bade khiladinnon ke pravesh se france ke liye kadi spardhaa vaala banataa ja rahaa he
 France will have to devise an accurate and effective strategy for cooperation under the Make in India program in defense production
 iske alaava, bharat ke saath kareebi rishte france kii antarrashtriya bhoomika ko vistaar denge kyonki isse asia ke bhu-rajnatik, suraksha or arthvyavastha ke kshetra main uski raftaar bad jaaegi
 If the assumption is true that economic and political power is leaning towards Asia, then it will be in the interest of France to establish partnerships with the countries of democratic, liberal and pluralistic values, so that the current international system can be decided by consensus

 It can be seen that the elephant is putting garbage in the dustbin with its trunk and feet
 yugers kah rahe hai ki 'agar hathi aisa kar saktaa he to insaan kyon nahin? agar dustbin paas main hi rakhaa he or kachra uske paas main padaa hua he to kisi ne dustbin main kyon nahin daalaa
 But it seems that elephants are more sensitive to environment and pollution than humans

 lekin sarkaar chalaa rahe shaks ko acha prashaasak bhi hona chahie or rajya ke har hisse kaa khyaal rakhana chahie

 Is this a difficult period for NCP? Many of your leaders have gone to BJP and Shiv Sena
 
 Those who have reached the power of the Center and the state have a revengeful attitude towards the opposition
 unhone (purvagrahpurn) jaanch shuru kar di he or (kanoonee) karrwai kar rahe hai
 Those who were not able to counter it joined BJP or Shiv Sena
 unke vikalpon ke bare main kya sochate hai?aisa mere saath duusari baar hua he
 In 1980 i had 62 mlas
 unamem se 52 party chhodka chale gaye
 But i fought and raised new youth leadership
 agle chunaav main mere 73 vidhayak jite
 This time too, i am getting huge public support, especially from the youth
 yah mere liye naujavaanon ko saath lekar party ko phir se khadaa karne kaa acha mauka he
 At the age of eighty, the entire burden of your party is on your shoulders
 yuva netaa kahaan hai?mere yuva saathi apane-apane jilon main dhyaan de rahe hai
 i have taken responsibility for the entire state
 mere saath jayant patil, dhananjay munde or ajit pavaar hai
 i am more visible in the media than the rest of the leaders
 congress ke bare main aapaki raay kya he? kya party maranasann haalat main he?congress aaj vakt kii jarurat he, uski jaden desh ke har rajya main hai
 Shocks occur in political life
 1977 main congress post ho chuki thi or media kah rahaa tha ki vah 25 saal tak satta main nahin aegi
 But the Congress got a clear majority in 1980
 vaisaa phir hoga
 Will you at any point think about the merger of NCP and Congress? i started my career with gandhi-nehru ideology
 main aaj bhi uskaa aadar karata hum
 (congress and NCP) are working together, helping each other
 hamane vilay ke bare main nahin sochaa he par saath kaam karne se donon ko laabh ho rahaa he
 What do you think about the rise of BJP and Shiv Sena in recent years? asli bhaajapa atal bihari vaajapeyi or laalkrishna adwani kii thi
 They prepared good ground, eating other fruits
 atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sweekaaryata bhi alag thi
 You have been in opposition for 27 years in 50 years of your political life
 kya yah daur pehle se kuch alag he?sirf ek fark he—pehle kii sarkaron main samaj thi ki loktantr ke liye vipaksh bhi jaruri he

 The film did well at the box office

 But we are telling you some reasons that can be assumed that the film will not show anything special at the box office
 public kaa rispons-karan johar ne film ke pehle part se aalia bhatta, siddharth malhotra or varun dhawan ko launch kiya tha
 He is going to do something similar with this other part also
 film ke second part se vah chanki pandey kii beti ananyaa pandey or tara sutaria ko launch karne ja rahe hai
 The worrying thing is that nothing special has been made about the film and there is no special enthusiasm in the audience
 trailor se nahin prabhavit hue log-film ke trailor ko lekar phans main kaaphi excitement tha, lekin jab film kaa trailor relies kiya gaya to darshak isse kuch khaas prabhavit nahin hue
 Not only did the trailer of the film get less likes but in the comment box, users gave mostly negative response
 is par mims bane or kul milakar yah tay ho gaya ki film kaa trailor darshakon ko prabhavit nahin kar paaya he
 One thing that is understandable after watching the old goods-trailer in the new Klever is that Karan Johar is in a mood to serve the old story in the new Klever
 pichhali baar film main ek ladki or do ladke the or is baar ladkiyaan do or ladkaa ek he
 Tiger Shroff is an action hero and he has been tried to get everything that can pull the audience to theaters
 haalanki ananyaa or tara ke kaam main kahin-kahin anubhavheenata dikhti he
 Story and Content - Nowadays movies are running on only one concept and that is the content of the film
 damdaar pramotion ke jariye filmein maahaul banaakar relies to kar lee jaati hai lekin unka bijness sirf pehle hi din chalata he
 The audience then stops through negative reactions to mouth publicity and social media
 dharma production kii pichhali film isi tarah buree tarah pit chuki he
 Music and lyrics - Three songs from the film have been released so far and all the songs have been rejected from the public
 gane janata ko prabhavit nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Music is a big factor for any film to make a place in the public's heart
 student of da year 2 ke maamle main kahani jaraa ulti najar aa rahi he

 a bold leader like Modi has been very concerned about India ever since Mododi came to power in the interest of China
 upi chunaav main bijepi kii banpar jeet ke baad chini media ne chetaya tha ki modi jaisaa bold netaa china ke hit main nahin he

 After the anger erupted on every road in every city of the country, the Home Minister of the country had to trust that he would tighten the security of the country's capital Delhi and that too especially at night
 dilli kii ladakiyon or mahilaon ke naam kendriya grahamantri kaa bharosa bada tha
 Aaj Tak's reporters conducted a reality test and it started from the exact same place where the destruction of the girl who was fighting the battle against death began on the night of 17 December
 kya raat ke vakt ab dilli kii sadakon par mahilaayein mahfuj hanraat ke kareeb saadhe 11 baje dakshin dilli ke muniraka ilaake se waisi kii safed rang or kaale shishe vaali bas main hamaara rielity test kaa safai shuru hua
 Our motive was clear whether promptness and vigil on the streets of Delhi increased after that shocking incident and the claim of the Home Minister and the Delhi Police Commissioner

 a barricading is seen in front of some distance
 bairicading to lagi thi lekin checking puri or sahi tareeke se nahin hui
 Our journey had reached close to Vasant Vihar but on the way there was no strong check in any way
 dilli ke sabase posh ilaakon main se ek vasant vihaar lekin tamaam daavon ke baad abhi bhi uname dam utana nahin dikhaai de rahaa tha
 We thought that maybe a barricading somewhere along the way will block our path
 hamaari bas sarapat un raaston se hokar berok tok guzarati ja rahi thi jin raaston se 17 disambar kii raat un darindon kii bas bhi gujri thi
 We were heading towards Mahipalpur

 There is no checking on this barricading before Mahipalpur and the bus is allowed to go forward with great ease
 safar kuch or aage badhata he or aakhirkaar ham muniraka se kareeb 10 kilmotir kaa safar shuru karke mahipalpur pahunche
 At the same place, after playing a game of cruelty and cruelty, 6 pennies threw the girl and boy
 aakhirkaar mahipalpur main raat ke kareeb sava 12 baje hamaari bas pahunchi or yahaan checkpost par police ne hamaari bas main ghuskar check karnaa shaayad munasib samajha
 There was a good presence of police here and every vehicle was being closely monitored but there was still a lot to do
 muniraka se mahipalpur tak kaa rielity test to puraa ho chukaa tha
 Security and checking were found to be flawed at many places in the journey, but Aaj Tak's test was continued through the white bus and black glass bus on the streets of Delhi at night
 hamane vasant kunj se phir apana safar shuru kiya or kai kilometre kii duuri tay karne ke baad ajtak kii bas mahrauli tak pahunchi
 It has to be said with regret that the story got the same here
 tasviir vahi saamne ai, bairicading to kai jagahon par mili lekin bas rokkar poochtacha kaaphi kam jagahon par hui
 The reality test was completed by bus but in many places we found flaws on many paths which are still revealing the claims of government ministers and government officials
 yani abhi bhi bahut kuch karnaa baaki he

 '' In Hamirpur district of Uttar Pradesh, a tantric made a sick woman a victim of her lust under the pretext of treatment
 peedita mahila kii shikaayat ke baad police ne tantric khilaaf mukadmaa darj kar liya he
 This incident of rape is from Bidokhar village in Hamirpur district
 kanpur kii rahane vaali ekamhilakaphi samay se biimaar thi
 Even after spending lakhs of rupees on treatment, he was not getting rest
 pareshaan hokar mahila ke pati ne tantra mantra or baabaaon kaa sahaara lenaa shuru kar diya
 Because of this, the ailing woman came to the village of Hamirpur with her husband at the behest of her mother, to a tantrik named Ram Sharan
 jahaan ram sharan ne donon ko apane ghar main hi roak liya
 In the night, the tantric called the sick woman alone to her room on the pretext of worshiping and then accompanied her
 tantric ne munh kholane par mahila ke pati ko maarane kii dhamkee bhi di
 But after the incident, the wife told the whole incident to her husband
 iske baad pati-patni dhongi tantric ko sajaa dilaane ke liye police thane pahunch gaye
 The victim went to the women's station in Hamirpur and filed a case against the accused Tantrik Ram Sharan
 police ne maamle ko gambhirtha se lete hue aaropee tantric kii talash shuru kar di he
 It is being told that Ram Sharan has escaped since the incident

 But both the major small parties of the state All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU) and Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) see themselves in the role of King Maker
 jeviem rajya kii sabhi 81 siton par to ajasu 53 siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 JVM chief Babulal Marandi in an informal conversation with journalists said that no party is going to get absolute majority in the state

 In such a situation, his party will either sit in the opposition or if it joins a government then it will focus on implementing the minimum common program
 sutron kaa kahana he ki jeviem ke liye yah chunaav is lihaaj se mahatvurna he ki yah khud party pramukh babulal marandi ke siyaasi jivan ke liye mahatvapurn padaav he
 He has contested many times but his party could not succeed in doing well
 yadi unki party ke kuch pratyaashee jitate hai or vah sarkaar main shaamil nahin hote hai to phir jite hue vidhayak paala badalakar jeemem yaa phir bhaajapa kaa daaman tham sakate hai
 Therefore, to save his party, he no longer has the option to sit in the opposition

 This time the talks between the two could not be held on seat sharing

 Sudesh Mahato says that after the election results, he will decide whether to go with the BJP or towards an anti-coalition
 vah kehete hai ki unke liye bhaajapa-congress donon ek jaise hai
 a party leader says that if we look at the political journey of 19 years after the formation of Jharkhand (2000) then it is clear that voters do not give full majority to any party here
 loksabhaa chunaav main to bahumat dete hai lekin vidhansabha chunaav main aisa nahin he
 Secondly, the way the condition of the BJP is getting worse in the last five-six months, it is clear that the Raghuvar government is not coming to power again
 ajasu ke logon kaa kahana he ki chaahe bhaajapa ho yaa virdohi khame koi bhi dal bina ajasu kii madad ke sarkaar nahin bana sakati he
 In such a situation, keeping in mind the promise that Azu has made to the public, the party will see that which coalition pays attention to the words of Azu
 bhaajapa or jeviem ke netaa bhi paroksh rup se yah maanate hai ki ajasu yaa phir jeviem jaisi party chunaav baad mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayenge
 a BJP leader says that small parties can be negotiated if needed after the election results, however, the Raghubar Das government will return

 The chief researcher working on this, Alija Quintana, said that this planet is not Earth's twin brother, but his distant brother is definitely there

 Significantly, the controversial helicopter deal was discussed in Rajyasabha on Wednesday
 charchaa ke dauraan bijepi netaa prakaash jaavdekar ne sarkaar par maamle ko dabaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Prakash Javadekar said that the helicopter deal that benefited Italy is investigating the matter, while the country's government is trying to suppress the case despite incurring economic losses

 However, JDU, an important ally of NDA, is not in favor of the JPC probe

 Senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha said the move was going to foil the inquiry as the term of the current Lok Sabha would expire next year

 Both Jaswant Singh and Harin Pathak have a commonality
 donon hanuman kahe jate hai
 Jaswant Singh, Hanuman of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Hanuman of Harin Pathak Lal Krishna Advani
 endie kii chah saal kii sarkaar main har sankat main vaajapeyi ko jaswant singh yaad aate the
 Similarly, all the work of Advani's Gandhinagar seat was done by MP Harin Pathak from the nearby Ahmedabad East seat
 lekin is lok sabha chunaav main jaswant singh kaa tikat cat chukaa he or harin pathak ke sir par talwaar latak rahi he
 Advani is believed to be putting pressure on the party for Pathak's ticket
 sutron ke mutabik rajnath singh ne adwani se kaha ki wo gandhinagar seat se chunaav ladane ke liye maan jaaen
 As far as Pathak's ticket is concerned, the party will consider it
 lekin narendra modi, harin pathak ke tikat ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 In the 2009 elections too, Modi was adamant on cutting Pathak's ticket
 tab bhi adwani kii behad sakhti ke baad hi unhen tikat mil paaya tha
 But for the second Hanuman Jaswant Singh, there is no such leader in the party, which is why BJP, despite threatening rebellion, gave ticket to Colonel Sonaram Chaudhary, recently from Congress from Barmer
 vasundhara ne is bahaane ek tir se do nishane saadh liye
 One prevented Jaswant from becoming the second center of power in state politics, and the other gave a big message in the form of Sonaram Chaudhary to take the Jat votes together

 He was put forward by Vajpayee to put India's favor on the economic sanctions imposed after the nuclear tests in Pokhran
 sankat gharelu morche par ho yaa videshi morche par, jaswant singh hi aage aayaa karte the
 Jaswant Singh was severely criticized for taking the terrorists with him in return for rescuing hostage passengers after the hijacking in Kandahar, but he tolerated it
 sarkaar se hatane ke baad bhi vivaad unka peechha karte rahe
 Through his two books, he sparked intense controversy
 unhone kaha ki jab pivi narsinghraav pradhanmantri the tab pradhanmantri karyaalay main ek jasoos tha jo america ko khufia jaankariyaan detaa tha
 He later retracted from it
 jinna par likhi duusari kitaab main unhone vibhaajan ke liye sardaar patel kii nitiyon ko jimmedaar bataa diya
 Narendra Modi banned this book in Gujarat and BJP expelled him from the party
 haalanki baad main laal krishna adwani ke bich-bachaav karne par wo party main waapas aae
 The NDA also made him its candidate in the Vice Presidential election
 unke bete maanavendra singh ko vidhansabha kaa tikat bhi diya or wo jite
 But once again the paths of BJP and Jaswant Singh are seen to be different
 darasal, bijepi main ab kaman duusari peedi ke haathon main aa gai he
 The tickets distributed in this Lok Sabha election are confirming this
 party main ho rahe adhikansh faisle narendra modi, rajnath singh, arun jetali, venkaiya naidu, sushamaa swaraj or nitin gadakari jaise netaa mil kar rahe hai

 a post shared by Ayushmann Khurrana (@ayushmannk) on Jan 17, 2017 at 11:31 am PST sanjay lila bhansaali kii film padmavat ke virodh kii aanch ab jaipur litarechar festival par padane lagi he
 Actually, at the Karni Sena Festival, Javed Akhtar and Prasoon Joshi had announced their opposition
 iske baad in donon ne festival se kinaaraa kar liya he
 Now Javed Akhtar and Prasoon Joshi will not come to the Literature Festival
 bataa den, karani sena ne dhamkee di thi kijaipur litarechar festivalmen agar javed akhtar or prasoon joshi aate hai to unka vahi haal karenge jo sanjay lila bhansaali kaa kiya tha
 After this threat, it was decided that the two will no longer attend the Jaipur Literature Festival
 javed akhtar kaa virodh kyon?darasal, javed akhtar ne is vivaad par kaha tha, ''rajput-rajavaade angrejon se to kabhi lade nahin or ab sadakon par utar rahe hai
 These Rana people, who are Maharajas, remained standing in the court of British for 200 years
 tab unki rajputi kahaan thi? ye to raja hi isiilie hai, kyonki inhone angrejon kii gulaami sweekaar kii thi
 Along with this, Javed had described Padmavati's story as fake
 javed sahab ne sahitya ajtak ke seshan main kaha tha, ''main itihaaskaar to hum nahin
 i can tell you this by reading those who are recognized historians
 'unhone kaha, 'tivi par itihaas ke ek profesar ko sun rahaa tha
 He was telling that there was a great difference between the composition of 'padmavat' and the time of Alauddin Khilji
 jaaysi ne jis vakt ise likhaa or khilji ke shasankaal main kareeb 200 se 250 saal kaa fark tha
 There is no mention of Rani Padmavati until Jaisi has written Padmavati in all these years
 "prasoon joshi kaa virodh kyon?prasoon joshi kaa virodh is liye he ki wo sensor board ke adhyaksh hai
 And he had allowed the film to be released after some cropping in the film
 is vajah se karani sena unase naaraaz he
 The miscreants attacked the school bus, Padmavat has been released amid protests
 karani sena is film ko lekar gusse main he or desh ke kai rajyon main hinsak ravaiya akhriyaar kiye hue hai
 The alleged Karni Sena activists attacked a school bus on Wednesday in Gurugram, adjacent to Delhi
 itnaa hi nahin kai shaharon main cinemagharo main todphod bhi kii gai
 a fire in Ahmedabad in Gujarat, a major fire incident was also carried out in Ahmedabad, Gujarat
 yahaan karani sena ke sadasyon ne ek mal main hi aag laga di thi
 Police had to do two rounds of firing to control the uncontrollable crowd
 aag kii chapet main mal or aasapaas kii dukaane bhi aa gayi
 The central government of the BJP and the Modi government are completely silent about the film's silence on the BJP government
 vahiin, bijepi shasit madhya pradesh, rajasthan, haryana, gujarat or goa kii sarkaron ne is film ko bain bhi kar diya tha
 But the Supreme Court ordered the film to be released in the entire country, calling the ban wrong
 iske baad bhi in rajyon ne film na dikhaae jane ke liye supremecourt main apil daayar kii thi
 But the Supreme Court refused to ban the film
 aisa bhi maananaa he ki rajasthan main do loksabhaa or vidhansabha ke upachunaav 29 janvari ko hone hai
 In such a situation, BJP does not want to further annoy the already angry Rajputs
 is liye rajya main gundgardee ko puri chhot di ja rahi he
 Why is there a dispute? There is a dispute about many things
 aaropon ke mutabik film main allaudin khilji ko mahimamandit kiya gaya he
 The dream sequence is filmed between Khilji and Rani Padmini
 rani padmavati ko us tarah dikhaaya gaya jaisaa rajput yaa rajpariwaron main nahin hota
 The Ghoomar dance also resulted in misrepresentation of the Rajput society
 kaha ja rahaa ki purushon ke saamne raniyaan dance nahin karti
 Films based on this old story are being made on a story dating back seven hundred years
 hindi kavi maalik mohammad jaaysi ne padmavat likhi thi
 It mentions Rani Padmini and Khilji
 kuch log galp maanate hai to vahiin kai log ise aitihaasik kahani bataate hai
 It is said that Khilji was interested in Rani Padmini
 usne mewar par hamalaa kar diya tha
 Rani Padmini had done Jauhar with 16 thousand Rajput women

 What kind of politics will the future leaders of India do? Will they rise above identity, move away from the shadow of caste, emphasize aspirations, speak the language of taking everyone along? Or will they, like their predecessor leaders, do the same decadent politics of identity that deepens social divisions and relies on building vote banks based on inane populist manipulations? Here are five fast-paced young political leaders from India Today TV Managing Editor Rahul Kanwal: "we do not oppose anyone," the leader of the Patidar movement in Hardik Patel, Gujarat
 ham kisi ke khilaaf nahin hai
 i agree that some people may not like it when we talk about the same community
 magar ham keval yuvaaon ke liye naukariyaan or talim or kisaanon ke haq maang rahe hai
 Like the rest of India, Gujarat also has corruption in education, no jobs, farmers work all day, but they do not get the right price for their crops
 koi chaahe kisi bhi samudaay se aata ho, use apane adhikaar maangane kaa haq he
 No one ever asked, "hearty, why are you asking for reservation?" No one ever wanted to know the reasons behind our demand for reservation
 har kisi ne bas itnaa kaha, ''tum patel ho, tum oonchi jati se aate ho, tumhaare samudaay main hiron ke kaarobaari hai, tumhaare paas badi-badi jaminen hai, phir bhi tum aarakshan maang rahe ho?"ham yah nahin kah rahe hai ki aarakshan se hamaari sari mushkilen hal ho jaaengi, magar naukariyon ke liye machi cheekh-pukaar ko suniye, dekhie ki log kaise khudakushi kar rahe hai, dekhie ki skool kaise band ho rahe hai
 We do our work and do it with great pride
 ham kuch bhi chhipate nahin hai
 If anyone thinks that we talk about the politics of caste, then yes, we like caste politics
 "kanhaiya kumarajeenyu chaatr sangh ke purv adhyaksh''pahchaan kya he? agar aap mujhase puuchhen to sabase pehle main insaan hum, uske baad main asian hum, phir main hindustani hum, phir main bihari hum, phir main begusarai se hum
 Where is the problem? "" The first sentence of our constitution is "we are the people of India", but in this it "we" is very intangible, to make it more clear, it means that people of different castes, religions, cultures live in it
 
 " ''bharat ko badalata bharat bananaa he
 We are fighting for a just society

 1995 main hua tha charchit naina saahani murder cese, jab susheel ne patni kii hatya kar tandoor main shav jala diya tha
 Sushil Sharma is the former president of the Delhi Youth Congress and murdered his wife on suspicion of an illegal affair
 kya he tandoor cond?susheel sharma or naina saahani donon hi yuva congress se jude hue the
 Both of them had married love
 shaadi ke baad bhi susheel sharma ko yah shaq tha ki uski patni naina saahani kaa kisi or se prem prasang chal rahaa he
 Sushil also had Naina spying
 ek din jab wo ghar lautaa to usne dekha ki naina telephone par kisi se baat kar rahi he
 Seeing this, his suspicion increased and he blinded in doubt and shot Naina
 goli naina ke sir par lagi or uski tatkaal maut ho gai
 After this, Sushil along with a friend made a plan to hide the body of Naina
 in donon ne naina ko shav ko nai dilli sthit ashok yatri nivas (baad main iskaa naam ramada plaza hua, ab yah royal hotel ke naam se sthit he) le gaye
 They tried to burn Naina's dead body in the tandoor there at half past one in the night
 jab maance kaa tukdaa jaldi jal nahin rahaa tha to usne iske liye makkhan kaa istemaal kiya
 But at the same time, when the woman selling tea near the wall of the hotel was suspicious, she informed the police patrolling
 police ashok yatri nivas ke andar gai to yah puraa khel saamne aayaa or susheel sharma ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 a case was registered and the lower court heard all the arguments
 court main naina saahani ke mata-pita ne bayaan diya ki susheel naina ko bahut pareshaan karata tha, use martha-peethta tha
 The court sentenced Sushil Sharma to be hanged, considering this inhuman act as a heinous crime
 hai court ne bhi nichali adaalat ke faisle par muhar laga diya tha

 India's decision to ban e-cigarette is historic: US group jammu-kashmir se dhara-370 hathaaye jane ke baad ab is masale par madhya pradesh ke do purv mukhyamantri aamane-saamne hai
 In fact, on the Kashmir issue, former Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan, while targeting the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, said that he had called it a 'criminal'
 is par rajya ke purv siem or congress ke varisht netaa digvijay singh ne shivaraj singh par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki, 'chouhan jawaharlal nehru ke pair kii dhul bhi nahin hai

 jinhone azaadi ke liye sangharsh kiya, jinke kiye gaye kaary va deshhit main unka yogadan avismaraneey he
 Today, addressing them as criminals after 55 years of death is extremely objectionable and condemnable
 'aapako bataa den ki kashmir kaa hawala dete hue shivaraj singh chouhan ne jawaharlal nehru ko ‘apradhi'bataaya tha
 Addressing a program in Odisha on Saturday, Shivraj gave two reasons for this
 chouhan ne bataaya, 'jab bhartiya fouj kashmir se pakistani kabayaliyon ko khadedate hue aage bad rahi thi, thik usee vakt nehru ne sangharsh viraam kaa elaan kar diya
 Due to this, one-third of Kashmir remained under Pakistan's occupation
 yadi kuch din or sangharshaviram kii ghoshnaa nahin hoti, to puraa kashmir bharat kaa hota
 He further said, "jawaharlal Nehru's second offense was Article 370
 bhala ek desh main kaise do nishaan, do vidhaan (samvidhan) or do pradhan astitv main ho sakate hai? yah keval desh ke saath anyaay nahin balki aparaadh bhi he
 "let me tell you that earlier today, while accusing the Congress of being responsible for many problems in the country, Chauhan said that Jawaharlal Nehru had committed a crime by bringing Article 370 giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha, ‘nehru kii aitihaasik galati ko ab anuchhed 370 ko khatm karke pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sudhara he
 He said that the Modi government has also enacted a law to end the practice of triple talaq
 kai deshon ne kaaphi pehle hi teen talaak khatm kar diya lekin congress ne satta main rahete hue ise rokane ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 Kuldeep Rai Sharma also talked about the revenue gap in the policy level, Congress MP from the only Lok Sabha seat of andaman-nicobar reached the platform of Agenda Aaj Tak 2019 also spoke openly on the island's revenue
 unhone revenue ke str par pradesh kii puri tarah centre par nirbharta kaa zikr kiya or pradesh ko aatmanirbhar kaise banaaya ja saktaa he, is par bhi charchaa kii
 He said that the state does not have its own revenue
 centreshasit pradesh ko ek saal main paanch hajaar karod rupee kaa vaarshik anudaan centre sarkaar se miltaa he
 Kuldeep said that 20 to 30 percent of this grant is spent on developmental works
 30 hajaar sarkari karmchaariyon ke vetan or sarkari sampattiyon kii dekh- rekh par shesh raashi kharch ho jaati he
 He said that we have demanded from the central government that the budget of the state should be increased from five thousand crores to 10 thousand crores
 kuldeep ne kaha ki andaman-nicobar main bahut zyada potential he
 Comparing Singapore, he said that this country is not even equal to a tenth of the total area of andaman, but it is so developed
 congress saansad ne kaha ki ek saal main paanch lakh tourist andaman nicobar jate hai, jabaki singapore main 1
 85 crores
