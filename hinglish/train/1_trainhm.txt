 Has North Korea's dictator and US President Donald Trump decided that the war will continue
 kya is jang kii taarikh bhi tay ho chuki he
 And will the Third World War also begin with this war? In fact, all these questions are suddenly raising its head because the next prediction of Horacio Villegas, who predicted Donald Trump to become president, is that the third world war will start on the 13th of this month, which will last for five months

 Villegas' prediction of the end of the World War will be on October 13 is frightening because according to him, this World War will last a full 5 months and it will end on October 13
 villegus kii maane to is vishwayuddh main america, uttar korea, dakshin korea, japan ke saath-saath syria, rus or china bhi shaamil ho jaaenge
 This is the first time someone has made such a big prediction with an exact date

 kyoki uttar korea or syria ko lekar america kii ranneeti ab kisi se chhipi hui nahin he
 And it is being feared that a great war could erupt at any time
 puri duniya ko daraate hue villegus ne ye bhi bhavishyavaanee kii he ki ye mahayuddh puri tarah se parmaanu yuddh hoga
 And death and destruction will be unaccounted for
 jisamen duniya kaa ek bada hissaa khatm ho jayega
 However, after continuous testing by North Korea, this speculation was being done long back
 syria banegaa tisare vishwayuddh kii vajahauttar korea ke taanashaah kim-jong-un bhi baraabar parmaanu hamale kii dhamkee dete aa rahe hai
 According to another prophecy related to this Villegas will attack many of the world's big country, which will be a chemical attack
 is jang main syria ke raashtrapati bashar al asad kii bam visphot main maut ho jaaegi
 After Bashar's death, it was told that this war would take a terrible form
 syria ke mudde par america, china, rus or uttar korea ke bich tanaav bad jayega
 On social media, Horacio Villegas's prophecy is claiming that Syria will be the cause of the Third World War
 ek taraf jahaan america ne syria par shaktishaalee hamalaa kiya vahiin duusari taraf usne afghanistan par madar of ol bam kaa visphot kiya or ab uske jangi jahaaj korian peninsula main uttar korea ke liye tainaat hai
 Which countries like Russia and China are keeping an eye on
 kim-jong-un kii hatya kii sajeeshais bich north korea or america ke bich jubaani jang bhi tej he
 And if World War 3 starts from May 13 as predicted by Villegas, then number 13 will surely be recorded as a black date in the pages of history
 ek taraf jahaan america bhavishyavaktaa horsiyo villegus ne 13 may se tisare vishyayuddh kii bhavishyavaanee kii he, vahiin duusari taraf vishwayuddh se pehle hi america or dakshin korian khufia agenciyon ne milakar north korea ke sanakee taanashaah kim-jong-un kii maut kaa khufia farmaan jari kar diya he
 North Korea has claimed that enemies have drawn up a plot to assassinate Kim-jong-un
 or use kisi saarvajanik kaarykram main maarane kaa plan he
 a contract to kill the North Korean dictator has been issued
 khufia sutron se aisi khabaren aa rahi hai ki kisi saarvajanik kaarykram main hoga kim-jong-un par atake
 And if these reports are to be believed, Kim will be attacked with a biochemical weapon
 maut kii khabaron se pareshaan taanashahhameshaa phul confidence main rahane vaale north korian taanashaah ko khufia sutron kii is khabar ne pareshaan kar diya he
 It is being told that since this news, Kim-jong-un has been advised by his security advisors to distance himself from public events
 uttar korea ke khufia sutron ke mutabik america kii khufia agency siie or dakshin korea kii khufia agency ne milakar ek kiraye ke kaatil ko is kaam ke liye lagaaya he
 However, this fear has been revealed only and only from North Korea
 vahaan kii samachar agency kisiene main ek bayaan mutabik is saazish main jaev rasinic padaarthon main radiodharmee padaarth or naino sabstance kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 According to sources in North Korea, the CIA and South Korea's intelligence agency have hired the murderer whom Kim Jong could target during a military parade or public event
 dhire-dhire maut kii taraf badhegaa kim-jongbataya ja rahaa he ki ek baar ye hamalaa hone ke baad iskaa asar chah se 12 maheenon tak nahin dikhegaa
 But after that Kim will slowly move towards death
 jaankaar uttar korea ke is daavon ko isliye bhi sach maan rahe hai ki abhi kuch din pehle hi yuddh ke tanaav ko khatm karne ke liye siie ne america raashtrapati donald trump ko kim-jong kii hatya karaane kii salaah di thi
 According to reports, a Korean man has been given the contract to kill Kim-jong-un, so that it is easier for him to carry out this task in North Korea
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kiraye ke is kaatil se kim ko maarane kii deal rus main kareeb 3 lakh dollar main hui he
 Not only this, Kim's murderer has entered the border of North Korea
 jis shaks ko kim-jong-un kii hatya kaa zimmaa diya gaya he, wo rahane vaala to north korea kaa tha magar pichley kaaphi vakt se rus main rah rahaa tha
 However, there is no concrete evidence of the veracity of these reports
 har shaks par rakhi ja rahi he najarphir bhi north korea kii media main ye khabaren jor-shor se dikhaai ja rahi hai
 So the officers of Jongkim-jong are watching every person present in the country with the eyes of the person
 america-dakshin korian jasuson ko dhund nikaalane kaa opershan chalaaya ja rahaa he
 North Korea claims that not only the hired murderer is planning intelligence to kill his leader, but South Korean commandos are also plotting to assassinate Kim
 khabar he ki south korea khufia tareeke se apane special commandos ko training de rahaa he, taaki jang ke halaat main wo north korea main daakhil hokar kim-jong-un par hamalaa kar use maar saken
 Without whose permission, the leaf does not move in North Korea
 jiske saamne puraa mulk jhukta he
 Now South Korea's commandos are getting ready to bow down to it
 dakshin korian special commandon ko jo training di jaati he use puri duniya main sabase mushkil mana jaataa he
 The commando got the mission to kill Kim
 Therefore, not only does his body get bogged down but agility is faster than a leopard
 dard kya hota he inhen maaloom nahin
 Encouragement to remove the enemy
 ab inhen commando ko mila he kim-jong-un ko maarane kaa mishan
 It is needless to say that they finish the work given to them only by completing it
 yani kim-jong-un kaa bura vaqt shuru ho chukaa he
 It is being told that due to this preparation of South Korea, security officials of Kim-jong-un are very much in it
 unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki dakshin korea ke ye commando unke netaa par hamalaa karenge to uskaa jawaab inke paas kya hoga
 The plan is that if war situation arises, then the South Korean commandos will enter North Korea
 behad khufia taur par kim-jong tak pahonchege or mauka milte hi use maut ke ghat utaar diya jayega

 a Public Interest Litigation was filed in Patna High Court against Anand Kumar, the director of the well-known coaching institute Super 30 in Bihar
 is maamle par janhit yachika daayar karne vaale patna hoicourt ke varisht vakil manibhushan pratap senger ne kaha ki anand kumaar ke super-30 koching santhaan ko lekar jitne sawaal uth rahe hai uski nishpaksh jaanch honi chahie
 Sengar has also made the Bihar government a party in his petition
 patna hoicourt is maamle kii sunwaayee agle hafte hogi
 After the IIT result was published this year, all the institutions in Patna published the names of their successful students, but the list of students was not released by Ramanuj Mathematics and Super-30 Director Anand Kumar, who gained fame abroad
 unhone maukhik taur par bataaya ki unke super-30 sanstha se 26 parikshaarthiyon ne iaiti pariksha main safalataa pai he
 Many times questions arose on who are those 26 successful candidates, the organization should release their names but till now the name of the candidate has not been correctly stated by their organization
 is maamle ne itnaa tool pakad liya ki aaj ek vakil ne patna ke hoicourt main unke sanstha ke upar janhit yachika hi daayar kar di
 Mani Bhushan Pratap Sengar, the lawyer who filed the petition, said that for the last several days, there have been continuous reports in many newspapers in Patna that Anand Kumar runs Super-30 and Ramanuj classes, which is a big fraud by the institution and the future of children
 Is played with isi maamle ko lekar maine sibiai jaanch kii maang kii he, is sanstha main super -30 ke naam par bacchon kaa admician liya jaataa he or bacchon se 33 se 34 hajaar rupaya vasula jaataa he
 However, to show the world, Anand Kumar says that he has not taken a single penny
 anand kumaar puure desh main vibhinn shaharon main pehle pariksha yojit karavaate hai or usamen se chaatro kaa chunaav karte hai
 But for the last few years, the list of successful candidates in iits is not released by Anand Kumar's organization
 pichley kuch varshon se bacchon ke naam baar-baar doharaaye ja rahe hai
 Former Bihar DGP Abhayanand, who once taught children with Anand Kumar in Super-30, runs his own separate coaching
 unhone is vivaad par kaha ki kuch media main chal rahaa tha ki iaiti sanstha main pratiyogita kii taiyaari karaane vaale sanstha aagaamee iaiti pariksha main shaamil hone vaale parikshathiyon ke list jari kare aaj maine apni sanstha ke 23 bacchon kii list jari kar di he
 He said that if Anand Kumar's public interest petition has been filed on his organization, then i will not say anything in this matter
 2008 tak main bhi us sanstha se judaa tha, wo baccho ko kaise rakhte the kya khilaate the or kitna paisa lete the yah mujhe nahin maaloom kyonki main us sanstha ke manjament se nahin judaa tha
 He said that he used to go there only to teach and nothing made sense to me
 aapako agar charhari kaaya se lagaav he yaa aap apane madhumeh ke str ko kaabo main rakhana chaahate hon to aapako apane khan paan main shatavari, vajrangi or lahasun ko shaamil karnaa hoga
 One study has shown that obesity and diabetes can be controlled by the use of asparagus, vajrangi (artichoke) and garlic
 ‘da daily telegraph’ ke anusaar shodhakartaaon ne paaya he ki lahasun, shatavari or vajrangi main prachur maatra main kabrehydrate paaya jaataa he jiskaa seven karne se bhukh lagane kii pravriti kam ho jaati he or saath hi iske prayog se maanav sharir main madhumeh ke str ko niyantrit karne main sahaayta milti he
 According to the researchers, garlic, asparagus and vajrangi are active in the secretion of intestinal hormones, which reduces the tendency to feel hungry
 ye hormone, insulin ke prati samvedansheeltaa ko badhaate hai
 Insulin-related hormones are produced by the digestive glands, which allow glucose to enter the body's cells
 is prakriya se glucose ko niyantrit karne main madad milti he
 There is no age for love

 a wonderful story of a strange love has come out from Katihar jail
 yah kahani he jail main band ek mahila kaidi or usee jail main tainaat ek bihar police ke jawan kii
 The story begins about a year and a half ago, when the posting of Inamul Hauda of Bihar Police takes place in Katihar Jail and there he meets prisoner Sariful Khatoon in jail in connection with the kidnapping case
 jail se baahar nikal rachaai shaadijel main tainaat bihar police ke inamul houdah ko jail main band sariphul khatun se mohabbat ho gai
 Though Inamul Houda is already married and older than Sarful Khatoon, he is married to his girlfriend who came out of jail after getting a bail on the basis of Islam religion
 haalanki inamul houdah kaa kahana he kii usne aisa apane parivaar or pehali patni kii ijaajat ke baad kiya he
 He has justified his love for this marriage and has called for his love
 pyaar umr kaa mohataaj nahiisvalentainswah apni premika sah patni sariphul khatun ko prem pratik gulab kaa phool dete hue kahata he ki pyaar kisi jati, majahab or umr kaa mohataaj nahin hota he
 It can happen at any age
 isi ke jawaab main uski duusari patni kahati he ki mere liye inamul se acha shuhar koi ho hi nahin saktaa tha

 News doing rounds about change is not true -dr Vaidya loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan jansabha raily main vivaadit bayaan die jane kii vajah se begusarai se BJP ummidavaar or kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ke khilaaf chunaav ayog ne notice jari kiya he
 Giriraj Singh, in front of the party's national president Amit Shah, warned the people of the Muslim community from the stage that if there is a need for three hands for the tomb, then Vande Mataram will be sung in this country and say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 chunaav ayog dwaara notice kii vajah giriraaj singh ke bhadakaau or sampradayik bhaashan rahaa he
 He has always been at the center of discussion in this matter
 giriraaj singh ne buudhvaar ko party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke kaarykram main apane bhaashan ke dauraan anya baton kii charchaa karne ke alaava kaha ki kuch log bihar kii dharti ko raktranjit karnaa chaahate hai, sampradayik aag failaana chaah rahe hai, lekin BJP jab tak he na bihar main aisa hoga or na begusarai kii dharti par ve aisa hone denge
 After that Giriraj while referring to a so-called statement of Abdul Bari Siddiqui candidate from Darbhanga of Rashtriya Janata Dal said that 'RJD candidate says in Darbhanga that Vande Mataram i will not speak
 begusarai main bhi kuch log aakar bade bhai kaa kurtaa or chote bhai kaa pyjama pahanakar bhraman kar rahe hai
 But i want to tell them that those who cannot sing Vande Mataram, who cannot bow down to the motherland of India, remember that o Giriraj's maternal grandfather died on the banks of the Ganges in Simaria Ghat, a grave on the same land
 Not made but you need three hands
 tum aisa nahin kar paaoge to desh tumhen kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 After this, Giriraj finished his speech but certainly this part of the speech was shocking
 haalanki jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki giriraaj is baar jab nitish kumaar ke saath manch par hote hai tab ve sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas or sampradayik sadbhaav kaayam rakhane kii baaten karte hai lekin jab ve apane manch par or apni party ke varisht netaaon ke saamne bol rahe hote hai to muslim samudaay ke logon ko nishane par rakhane se nahin chookte

 On this, the High Court has issued notice to the Central Government, Assembly Speaker's Office and Kailash Gehlot and sought answers
 hycourt ne sabhi pakshon ko 10 din ke bheetar apana jawaab daakhil karne kaa nirdesh dete hue maamle kii agali sunwaayee ke liye 6 april kii taarikh tay kii he
 However, the Delhi High Court has at present refused to ban the minister from attending the assembly session
 court ne kaha ki vah bina mantri kaa paksh jane kisi tarah kii roak nahin laga sakati
 The petition has been filed by 3 BJP mlas Vijender Gupta, OP Sharma, Jagdish Pradhan and Manjinder Singh Sirsa
 ise bhi padhein : BJP vidhayakon ne LG se milakar kailash gahalot ko hataane kii maang keeis yachika main kaha gaya he kimantri kailash gahalotako chunaav ayog dwaara ayogy tehraae jane ke baavjood spikar dwaara vidhansabha kii kaarywahi main hissaa lene kii anumati dena galat or kanoon ke khilaaf he

 bijepi vidhayakon ne court me tark die hai ki ek baar jab kisi vidhayak ko chunaav ayog ayogy ghoshit kar detaa he to wo vidhayak ke rup main bana nahin rah saktaa he
 That is why the mlas presented the petition in the court
 saath hi court ko turant hastkshep kar mantri ko vidhansabha kii kaarywahi main bhaag naa lene kii maang kii he
 In such a situation, it is wrong for the speaker to say that within 6 months of being disqualified, Gehlot has time to get re-elected, so Gehlot can take part in the proceedings of the House
 bataa den, gahalot ke vakil rajeev naiyar ne yachika kaa virodh karte hue court se ise radd karne kii maang kii he
 The Election Commission had recommended the declaration of 20 mlas as Commissioners on 19 January, which was approved by the President on 20 January
 in 20 vidhayakon main kailash gahalot bhi shaamil hai

 LIVE: nahin rahe arun jetali, 66 saal kii umr main nidhan, yahaan padhein har apadetmana jaataa he ki abivipi main kaam karne ke dauraan hi arun jetali kii narendra modi se mulaakaat hui thi
 But in the following days, a series of strengthening of relations between these two leaders became stronger
 modi se jab mili
 
 
 a report by Pravin Donti, published in the English magazine Caravan, quoted a Delhi BJP leader as saying that Jaitley had taken notice of Narendra Modi, the organizer of the bjp's 1991 National Integration Yatra
 (arun jetali ke sarkari bangale se hui thi najafagarh ke nawab kii shaadi)report aage bataati he ki ‘jetali ne ab tak apane jitne rishton ko posa, unamem narendra modi ke saath unke rishton ke taar un dinon tak jate hai jab modi ek mahatvakankshi prachaarak hua karte the
 From him, this relationship, which, more than trust, rests on the foundation of mutual benefit, has paid him the highest dividend
 ve kai myanon main ek-duusare ke poorak hai
 One is a prevalent leader, the other is infiltrated by the elite
 ek ke liye desh kii rajdhani dilli pardes he, to duusare ke liye janaa-pahachaanaa ghar
 According to the report, when the BJP government came to power in Gujarat in 1995, Modi was sent to work in Delhi
 jetali bhi un logon main shaamil the jinase unhone apane rishte majboot kiye
 He took care of Modi like he cares for other special people
 us vakt kisi or ne modi ko utani tavajjo nahin di, na hi kisi ne unhen utani gambhirtha se liya tha
 Many journalists and BJP leaders still remember that Modi was often seen in Jaitley's South Delhi house
 modi-amit shah-jetali kii jodimodi ke karibiyon main amit shah ke baad jo doosraa naam aata he wo he arun jetali kaa naam
 In 2014, India Today wrote in a cover story on PM Modi, Amit Shah and Arun Jaitley, The Indispensable Mr
 Jaitley that "assuming cross-mythology can be used in today's era of Hindutva" , It wrote, if Modi is Ram then Shah and Jaitley are his Laxman and Arjun

 On one side the Food Security Bill and on the other side the plunder of billions
 ek taraf muft main anaaj baant kar 82 karod logo kaa pet bharne kaa sawaal or duusari taraf sava sau karod logon ke haq or zarurat ke paison main send lagaakar arabon-kharbon kii lut
 That is, there is also the loot of power, and the dream of making the June 2 bread of the country starved of loot money
 desh ke saamne pehali baar yah sawaal bada hota ja rahaa he ki aakhir garibi kii rekha se neeche 80 karod log hai kyon? or desh ke sirf 8 karod logon ko 80 karod logon se zyada sansaadhan kyon muhaiyaa karaaye ja rahe hai?sawaal yah bhi he ki ek taraf anaaj se lekar pani or shiksha se lekar ilaaj tak ke jariye chand log arabon munafa bana rahe hai or desh ke 70 phisadi logo ko pani, shiksha or ilaaj muhaiyaa nahin he
 If you notice, the government is talking about cheap food grains through the food security bill, there is a budget of one lakh crore for it
 yani anaaj baantne ke naam par lut kii puri sambhaavna he kyoki sarkaar kii har waisi yojana jo vyapak taur par logon ke liye hoti he uskaa charitra hi kaise lut main ja simata he yah sarkaar kii yojanao se hi samajha ja saktaa he
 See a hallmark of this
 
 
 
 - Loot in MNREGA
 - gramin swasthya yojana main lut
 - Looting coal allocation
 - sanchaar infrestracchar main lut
 - Plunder of food grains
 - kisaanon ke raahat package main lut
 That is, wherever the schemes related to the majority section of the country are in question, the scam and loot has become a rare truth of the present time
 or sarkaar kii nitiyaan garibon ke liye sarkari yojanaon or nitiyon ke tahat nijee companio ke haath kyon majboot karti hai yah isse bhi samajha ja saktaa he ki ab jab sarkaar food sicyorti bill ke jariye congress ke haath ko aam aadmi ke saath jodne kii baat kah rahi he to pehali baar anaaj baantne kaa bajet ek lakh karod kaa he or desh ke krirshi mantralay kaa bajet iskaa aadha bhi nahin he

 Book: Walls Walls Writer: Irshad Kamil Prakasak: Vani Prakashan: 200 Rupees: Horde boundpreem is necessary
 
 Girl's love of Fitturlade's love of Ayyashil's girl Poison's boy's love of blood's love's blood, Father's heart's disease , Bhai 's embarrassment, Mousi's spice of a spice, Aunt's chuckling, Horse's tongue's lusty tongue, Marriage's love today, let's find another
 vaani prakationase prakashitabolati deevaaren
 
 jab do kirdaaron ke jariye fusfusaati he to ye pathak ke kaanon ko ‘baari’ lagati hai
 But when they read the poems at small intervals in between, small bubbles burst in the inner air and a small light voice emerges from it
 
 Irshad bolti deevaaren
 
 irshaad kamilalikhit naatak he
 While reading, many times you feel that you are reading the script of a Mumbai movie
 irshaad khud bhi yah kehete hai ki ‘yah naatak filmi prem par saikadon geet likhane kii thakaavat kaa nateeja he’
 So now the reader has to decide whether the result of exhaustion is good or bad
 naatak kii samiksha likhte vakt jab vartmaan paridrishy par najar jaati he, to iskaa vajan badhane lagata he
 When love starts to be a jihad, then the ears of the speaking walls will also make the noise of love jihad
 aise main ‘wasim’ agar aaj ke kisi jite jaagate samaaj main ‘puja’ se prem karata he, to sambhav he ki lav jehadi qaraar diya jaataa or uske saath kya suluk hota koi nahin jaanata
 However, Irshad Kamil's 'wasim' is lucky in this sense and he finds a good Hindu man in the form of a priest, who gives shelter and protects the bearded Muslim in his temple
 irshaad kii ‘bolti deevaaren’ apana sandesh dene main kaamyaab he
 Innocent bird
 
 
 or sadda haq
 
 jaise manikhej gane likhane vaale irshaad kaa naatak apane doylog kii vajah se kamjor najar aata he
 The craft and structure of the play is influenced by the film and also has a dramatic twist
 deviaise mat dekho
 
 wasim ne mujhe sab bataaya he
 Pooja: What did she tell you? 
 
 meri tis, meraa dard, meraa pal-pal maranaa bataaya?
 
 
 Told me the reason for living
 
 
 meri uljhan or paagalpan kii vajah bataayi
 
 
 But i know his jealousy
 
 
 jaanati hum ki kyon kaha usne mere sasur ko ki main ranjit ke liye shubh nahin
 
 
 This drama becomes relevant when the love of Hindus and Muslims begins to become 'love jihad'
 bhale hi ‘lav jehad’ kaa maamla madhya varg or garibi rekha se neeche rahane waalon par lagu ho
 Because there is no justification for the upper class
 apane paatro pujari, uski patni devi ke saath puja or wasim kii prem kahani ke jariye irshaad kamil aaj ke halaat main chauraahein par aainaa liye khadey hai
 So that by doing politics on love, those who draw the line between Hindu and Muslim can see their face
 uttar pradesh main yogi sarkaar ne jis anti romeo squad kaa gathan mahilaon kii suraksha or manchalon par lagaam kasne ke liye kiya tha, wo kai baar manamaani karne or bekasooron ko pareshaan karne ke liye charchaa main he

 It said that the caught Romeo should not be bald, no soot should be put on their mouths nor should they be punished for making cock

 According to the news of the English newspaper Indian Express, after seeing the picture of the cat on the Aadhaar form, the authorities found out the case
 police ne 'unic identification athurity of india' (UIDAI) kii shikaayat ke baad ye kadam uthaaya

 The people of Delhi are disillusioned with Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party
 dilli ke vibhaagon ke liye kejariwal ke nirdeshon kaa hawala dete hue anil vij ne twit kiya, ' kejariwal pehle apane astitv ko sabit karen
 This comment of his made ghee in the fire and Kejriwal's team started commenting on it
 'vij ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya kickejarivalane hameshaa 'yuj and thro' kii niti apanaai he

 harbhajan ne jo photo post kiya he usamen ek police karmchaaree ek mahila jisane haath main bachche ko thama hua he, usko danda se peethta hua dikhaai de rahaa he

 The ban on meat in Mumbai has been reduced by two days
 ab 13 or 18 sitambar ko meet kii bikri par roak nahin rahegi
 The Bombay High Court gave this order while hearing an application filed against Meat Bain
 ullekhneey he ki jain samudaay ke paryushan parv ko lekar matan par chaar din ke bain ke khilaaf matan kaarobaariyon ne court kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha
 The court asked the Maharashtra government, when you talk about non-violence, then why was there no ban on fish, seafood and eggs
 adaalat ke is sawaal ke jawaab main sarkaar ne kaha ki matan or machhlee main fark he
 The government's top lawyer Anil Singh said, "the fish dies as soon as it is taken out of the water, so there is no slaughter involved
" unhone court ke samaksh jo spashtikaran diya, uskaa aashay tha ki koi vadh nahin hona chahie
 The ban is opposed not only by the opposition, but also by the ruling bjp's ally Shiv Sena
 court main sarkaar ko is bain ke peeche ke tark par sawaalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The judges said, in view of globalization, we have to change our outlook
 apane kadam ko sahi tehraate hue sarkaar ne kaha, supreme court ke ek faisle main kaha gaya he ki ham samudaay vishesh kii bhaawanaaon kaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 It does not matter that the Jain community in Mumbai has less number of people
 tippaniyan Apart from the opposition Congress and NCP, bjp's ally Shiv Sena has alleged that the BJP is trying to appease the Jain community keeping in mind the 2017 local body elections
 paryushan ke dauraan meet par bain 1994 main shuru hui thi or us samay congress kii sarkaar thi
 Officials said that after 10 years, the two-day ban was increased to four days, but in reality it was never implemented

 It is noteworthy that the mutton traders had approached the court against the four-day ban on mutton for the festival of Jain community
 adaalat ne maharashtra sarkaar se poocha, jab aap ahimsa kii baat karte hai, to phir machhlee, sifood or andey par bain kyon nahin lagaaya gaya
 In response to the court's question, the government said that there is a difference between mutton and fish
 sarkaar ke sheersh vakil anil singh ne kaha, machhlee ko jaise hi pani se baahar nikaala jaataa he, vah mar jaati he, isliye isamen koi vadh shaamil nahin he
 The explanation he gave before the court meant that there should be no slaughter
 is bain kaa vipaksh hi nahin, sattadhari bijepi kii sahyogi shivasena ne bhi virodh kiya he
 In the court, the government faced questions on the reasoning behind this ban
 jajon ne kaha, vaishvikaran ke maddenjar hamen apane najariye main badlaav laana hoga
 Justifying its move, the government said, a Supreme Court decision has said that we should respect the sentiments of the particular community
 isse koi fark nahin padataa ki mumbai main jain samudaay ke logon kii sankhya kam he
 The comments vipakshi congress or ensipi ke alaava bijepi kii sahyogi shivasena ne aarope lagaaya he ki 2017 ke sthaneey nikaay chunaavon ko dhyaan main rakhkar bijepi jain samudaay kii tushtikaran kii koshish kar rahi he
 The ban on meat was introduced in 1994 and the Congress was in government at that time
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki 10 saal baad do din ke bain ko badhaakar chaar din kar diya gaya tha, lekin asal main ise kabhi lagu nahin kiya gaya
 On Thursday, many meat shops were open on the first day of the ban, but government slaughterhouses remained closed

 co / mvevua322w— Ravi Shankar Prasad (@rsprasad)april 15, 2018 The cases of deaths due to the fall of flyover in Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have now sparked war in the government departments and agencies of Uttar Pradesh
 sethu nigam ke chairman rajan mittal ne aarope lagaaya he kivaranasi prashasanne unhen sahyog nahin kiya
 Many times a letter was written to close this road, but on the contrary, the Varanasi administration filed a case against their officials
 yahi vajah he ki unhen khule raste main yah pul bananaa padaa
 Stung by these allegations of Setu Nigam, the Varanasi administration has said that they have a complete letter of documents
 isamen unhone sethu nigam ko is pul ko banane puri prashasnic madad di he, yah koi pehla pul nahin he
 Earlier, 3 bridges of Setu Nigam have been completed and all the correspondence that has been done, all indicate that there is no lapse in administration
 varanasi ke dm yogeshwar ram mishra ne 'ajtak' se kaha ki jab jab is pul ko banane ko lekar sethu nigam ne unase jo-jo sahyog maanga use prashasan ne diya he chaahe vah sadakon ke chaudeekaran kaa ho, raste se dharmik sthalon ko hataae jane kaa ho, trephic vyavastha sudrudh karne kaa ho
 The administration has done everything, but they do not understand the reason for such rhetoric after the accident
 yogeshwar ram mishra ne kaha kisetu nigamako metro kii tarah apane project ko chaaron taraf se tin ke shit se gherkar kaam karnaa chahie tha, lekin un logon ne zyaadaatar jagahon par aisa nahin kiya
 On the demand of Setu Nigam to stop traffic on both sides of the bridge under construction, the DM said that it is the most important road in the city of which the railway station is the only road connecting the bus stand to the airport
 aise main ise band nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It is clear that two departments and two agencies of the Yogi government are face to face after this accident and this is enough to make the government worse

 When you hear a Muslim vote bank from Shrimukh of a leader or a journalist, what images emerge in your mind
 main ges karata hum
 Do you understand that the members of the Muslim vote bank vote inspired by an Islamic religious consciousness, vote at the behest of a cleric, there is no distinction between political parties, they never vote for issues The Muslim vote bank only votes for the Muslim
 ab ye chhaviyaan akele prime time se to nahin tuutane vaali hai
 Anyway, i am an anti-yodagan journalist
 acha ho yaa bura yogadan nahin karnaa chahta
 a Muslim in simple Hindi is one who follows Islam
 magar islam ke anuyaayi kai panthon main bante hai
 Shia, Sunni, Wahabi, Deobandi, Barelvi, Dawoodi, Vohra
 bharat main to musalmaan anek jatiyon main bante hai
 There is a distinction of forward-backward, rich-poverty
 in dinon pichhadaa or dalit musalmaan apni alag raajnneetik pahchaan ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa he
 Yet we ask outright where the Muslim will go, because the political parties feel that calling a thousand-five hundred Muslims in a vacant stadium and giving a speech, communicates with the Muslims
 ek aam muslim matadaata ke is vivek ko muslim vot bank kah kar kahin uskaa sampradayikaran to nahin kiya jaataa he
 Then how is the Paswan, Kushwaha or Yadav vote bank different from the Muslim vote bank
 musalamaanon ke muddon par koi baat kyon nahin karata
 Will they continue to be seen only in the context of riots
 ab aate hai maafee par
 Rahul Pandita has written in The Hindu that forgiveness is a national passtime these days
 mujhe to saafee kii tarah sunai detii he
 If not accused of publicity, our leaders are apologizing like Saafi
 maaloom nahin khun saaf karne ke liye yaa khun maaf karne ke liye
 No law provides for amnesty for those accused of murder
 naitikta kaa sawaal to gart main hi chalaa gaya he
 This pardon is being used for two leaders
 ek narendra modi or doosraa rahul gandhi
 The Sikhs did not ask for the massacre if they did not ask for Gujarat
 patrkaar jaankaar to kisi aise din kaa intjaar kar rahe hai, jab ye donon netaa balakani main aakar maafee bol denge or phir sab id kaa chand dekhne ke baad kii tarah maafee mubarak- maafee mubarak karne lagenge
 Rajnath Singh's statement comes that if anything wrong has happened to us, she will bow down and apologize
 to sabko lagata he ki maafee hone vaali he
 Another incident is going on with the clin chit
 supreme court ne kaha ki narendra modi ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane ke paryaapt saboot nahin hai
 Many parties saw this as an opportunity for an end to the political controversy
 ab yah nahin maaloom ki paryaapt sabooton ke abhaav main kahin titalar or sajjan kumaar ko clin chit mil gaya to ve kya karenge? In the February 3 Indian Express, Vinay Sitapati has written that the Congress and ngos overemphasized Modi's role in the riots, leaving behind questions of the crime and political background of the rest of the rioters
 insaaf kii ladaai sandigdh hui
 Sitapati, through his research, points out that in the riots the Gujarat government is investigating and prosecuting the riots cases, only five percent of the cases have been convicted after 12 years, while the punishment in the cases under the supervision of the Supreme Court was 39 percent
 is
 sitapati or rahul pandita donon kehete hai ki gujarat main modi kaa dangon kii aaropee maaya kodenani ko mantri bananaa or dilli main congress kaa dibangat echkeel bhagat ko mantri bananaa kya tha? maaya kodenani is vakt jail main hai
 In Sitapati's article, there is a statement from a Nazir Khan Pathan, 'both scare us
 ek hindu vot lene ke liye hamen daraata he to doosraa hamaara vot lene ke liye’ We want to understand this apology in the context of the prevailing politics of Muslim vote
 yah ek tathy he musalmaan bijepi ko vot detaa he
 He does not even give 100 per cent to any non-bjp party
 sawaal he ki bijepi kya musalamaanon ko tikat detii he
 The BJP fielded 611 candidates in the four state assembly elections held last November, of which only 6 were Muslims
 rajasthan main chaar ko tikat diya or do jite
 Before that there was not a single candidate in Gujarat and Karnataka
 jabaki in chunaavon kii reliyon main bijepi ne khub pradarshit kiya ki kitni taadaad main burke main ai or kitne taadaad main topi main
 The Congress gave tickets to 54 Muslims in Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi altogether
 koi khaas record nahin he
 So the question here is about participation or forgiveness or clean chit
 aaj ke times aaf india main khabar he ki 722 bharatiyon kii jaan bachaane vaale ek bharvahak pot ke captain jainul aabidin ko branda ilaake main ghar nahin mila
 When he went to buy, the broker told that the society in which you want there is an unwritten rule
 musalmaan ko na ghar bechnaa he na kiraaye par dena he
 You will never hear the big leaders of two parties calling against it
 kya yah aparaadh nahin he? (puraa video dekhen) Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has returned from his tour of Europe

 The BJP had targeted Rahul Gandhi for both the tours

 If you are a public figure, you are open to criticism
 surely
 But god forbid if you question / criticize or retaliate anything, absolutely anything at all, hell breaks loose
 And then “they” say that celebs don’t have a voice

 lekin sanket yahi hai ki selector team ke saath zyada chhedchhad nahin karenge
 There has been an uproar after the Indian team lost by 10 wickets
 ab sabase bada sawaal ye he ki baaki bache do maichon ke liye hone vaale sellection main kya koi bavaal hoga, kya galatiyon se team india koi sabak legi or england se badale ke liye kya kiya jayega team india main badlaav?mumbai main hone vaale sellection kamity kii meeting main team india main pherbadal par shaayad hi koi maathapai ho

 Team India still has two chances to win the series

 During this time, a journalist asked Sonu Nigam about the statement of former MP Nilesh Rane, in which he alleged that Bal Thackeray had conspired to kill him (sonu Nigam)
 ye sawaal sunakar sonu ne koi jawaab nahin diya, balki ve ajeeb tarah se riect karne lage
 Nobody could understand whether their answer is yes or no
 bataa den ki purv mukhyamantri narayan rane ke bete or purv saansad nilesh rane ke is bayaan se maharashtra kii siyasat garmai hui he
 Nilesh Rane had accused the late Shiv Sena chief Balasaheb Thackeray, "he had conspired to kill Bollywood's famous singer Sonu Nigam
 unke kehane par shiv sainikon ne sonu nigam ko jaan se maarane kii koshish bhi kii thi
 'see Sonu Nigam's reaction in the video
 In his allegations, Rane also said,' While doing politics, we have never done any wrong things about Bal Thackeray
 iske baavjood mere pita narayan rane par gande aarope lagaae jate rahe hai
 Many truths of Bal Thackeray are buried
 'rane yah bhi kehete najar aae logon ko bal thakare kii sachai ke bare main bhi bataanaa hoga
 Balasaheb was also responsible for the death of Shiv Sena leader Anand Dighe
 anand dighe kii hatya kii sajeesh kaise hui thi

 This time the students did not show much interest in taking admission in IIT, the country's premier engineering institute
 is baar 650 siten khaali rah gayi or unamem admician ke liye koi nahin aayaa
 According to a Hindi daily, this happened because the students were not particularly interested in the new iits and apart from that there are some subjects in which the students were not interested because they are not very encouraging in terms of career
 IITJEE advance counselling ke pramukh emke panigrahi ne bataaya ki pehle charan main 9,711 siton kii counselling main 9,061 siton main hi chaatro ne daakhila liya
 Another professor said that this number is for students who have not taken admission
 abhi to ve chaatr baaki hai jo daakhila waapas lenge
 Since last time, students in IIT have started withdrawing their names after taking admission
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki ve nae IIT kii bajaay enaiti yaa phir achche privet ejineering collejon main admician le lete hai
 Another reason is that in the iits of South India, students from the north are reluctant to take admission due to food and drink
 kuch chaatro ke abhivavak nahin chaahate hai ki unke bachche utani dur jaaen
 This time IIT has stopped studying in some subjects because students do not take admission in them and many times they leave midway
 chaatro ko lagata he ki bharat main un vishyon main kai khaas bhavishya nahin he
 Bombay IIT is currently the most preferred engineering college
 isamen admician ke liye sabase zyada aavedan aate hai

 hafte bhar baad congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii pehali chunavi raily jo honi he
 Therefore mobilization of the crowd is the responsibility of the government and Daromdar is on the shoulder of these mlas
 congress vidhayak naseeb singh ne kaha, 'hamaare netaa aaenge isliye taiyaari to kerani hi padegi
 The purpose of the rally is to distribute certificates to give ownership to 45 resettlement colonies
 magar certificate ke bahaane ek to rahul dilli ke chunavi maidan main koodeinge, doosraa shila dikshit ke bete or purvi dilli se saansad sandip dikshit kaa siyaasi cheharaa bhi chamakegaa
 It is so certain that the Congress will contest for the fourth time with Sheela's face

 # ROSEARMY # whywomendontreporta post shared by Rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) on Oct 11, 2017 at 9:19pm PDT Under the banner of Madhya Pradesh Loktantrik Adhikar Manch, intellectuals and social activists demonstrated at the Budhwara crossroads in Bhopal to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 isi manch se bhopal madhya ke vidhayak aarif masood ne kaha ki agar rajya sarkaar enarasi lagu karegi to ve vidhansabha ke sadsy nahin rahenge
 He said that modi-shah destroyed the dreams of those who had martyrdom in the freedom of life
 main sarkaar se kahuunga ki jis tarah mamata banerjee ne saahas dikhaaya he, vaisaa hamaari sarkaar dikhaae or use riject kare
 If the government considers the NRC, i will not be a member of the Legislative Assembly
 masood ne naagarikta sanshodhan bill kaa bhi virodh kiya
 He said that people should launch a big movement against it
 madhyapradesh vidhansabha main 115 vidhayakon ke saath apane dam par congress bahumat ke aankade se abhi bhi ek kadam peeche he
 It has the support of 121 mlas with the support of 4 independents, 2 BSP and one SP MLA in the 230-member assembly

 After the shameful gang rape, Chandigarh is now ashamed of the atrocities committed by a step mother with her three-and-a-half-year-old innocent daughter
 julm aisa kii aapaki ruh kaanp jaae
 The video of this atrocity, which has become a rage, is going viral on social media
 is video main jasprit naam kii ek mahila saadhe teen saal kii maasoom ko ek bori main bhar kar use berahami se peet rahi he
 Nobody would have ever seen such a genius of a woman
 maasoom ke saath julm dhane vaali 31 saal kii aurat manmohan singh kii patni he
 It can be seen clearly in the viral video that Jasprit stuffs the innocent in a sack and closes tightly
 use upar se neeche tak jhatakati he
 Screams of innocent fear locked in the sack
 haivaan maa usase kahati he ki aisi hi aawaaj uski hameshaa nikalni chahie
 Jasprit's husband died in an accident about 6 years ago
 uski ek saat saal kii beti he
 The victim's real mother died of cancer in 2016
 manmohan ke ek betaa or ek beti hai
 After this, he met Jaspreet
 donon ne baad main shaadi kar lee thi
 Manmohan never thought that one day his second wife, Hwan, would fall on his little daughter
 manmohan ke bete ne hakeekat bataai ki sauteli maa jaraa si galati ke liye maasoom ko buree tarah se maarthi-peethti he
 After this, Manmohan imprisoned Jasprit's handiwork in mobile
 thane main aaropee patni ke khilaaf maamla darj karvaa diya
 The accused woman has been living in her maternal home for two months
 usne video saamne aane ke baad khudakushi kii koshish kii, lekin batch gai
 Police have registered a case against the accused woman
 vah apane maayke se faraar bataai gai he
 The matter has also been brought to the notice of the Commission for Protection of Child Rights
 adhyaksh ne manmohan or jasprit ko saman jari kiya he
 After US President Barack Obama imposed a ban on Syrian President Bashar Assad and his six aides, a senior Obama administration official said Assad would either try for democracy or leave the power
 naam nahin chhapane kii shart par ek varisht prashasnic adhikari ne kaha, raashtrapati asad ke paas spasht vikalp maujuud he
 Either try to restore democracy or give up power
 unhone kaha ki yah sandesh asad hukumat ko de diya gaya he
 The Obama administration has not made this harsh message public
 syria sarkaar dwaara desh ke nagarikon ke khilaaf hinsa kaa istemaal kiye jane or utpeedan kii ghatnaon kii kadi ninda karte hue adhikari ne kaha ki syria main haal kii ghatnaon visheshkar pichley saptaah kii ghatnaon ko dekhte hue yah saaf taur par kaha ja saktaa he ki desh purv kii sthiti main nahin laut paa rahaa he
 The central government has the right to decide who is to be crowned as the next Deputy Governor of Delhi
 lekin najeeb jang ke istife ke baad se hi siyaasi halkon main tamaam naam tairne lage hai
 On social media too, people are giving their opinion about the possible candidates regarding the name of the new LG
 twitor par bies bassi or kiran bedi jaise naamon ko uchhaalkar kejariwal sarkaar kaa majaak udaaya ja rahaa he
 # bedi4delhilg is trending on Twitter in support of making Kiran Bedi the next Deputy Governor
 logon ko lag rahaa he ki agar kiran bedi kodilli kaa aglaa up rajyapalabanaaya jaae to wo siem arvind kejariwal ko sahi jawaab de sakati hai jo aae din centre kii modi sarkaar ko koste rahete hai
 By the way, the Kejriwal government also had a confrontation with Najeeb Jung and the Deputy Governor was accused of acting at the behest of the Modi government
 dilli sarkaar baar-baar kahati rahi ki modi sarkaar unhen rashtriya rajdhani main koi bhi janata ke hit kaa kaam karne main adnga daalati rahi
 In such a situation, if Bedi is made the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, the central government will be able to counter the Kejriwal government properly
 twitaravaalon ko lagata he ki bedi kii eemaandaaree ko lekar sawaal uthanakejariwal ke liye aasaan nahinhoga
 Delhi CM Kejriwal calls himself the most honest leader
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki dilli kii janata ne unhen sir ankhon par liya tha
 Kiran Bedi's track record is also clean
 sanyog yah bhi he ki donon hi anna hajaare ke 'india against karpshan' andolan main saath rahe hai
 Kiran Bedi's image has been as a high-profile IPS officer
 twitor par inhen 'ladi singhm' kaha ja rahaa he
 People are assuming that if Bedi is made the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, then it will be difficult for Kejriwal to question the security and law and order in Delhi, which Kejriwal often does after becoming CM
 wo dilli police ko dilli sarkaar ke control main die jane kii bhi maang karte rahe hai
 Kiran Bedi is currently the Deputy Governor of Puducherry
 unhen is pad par rahete hue 6-7 maheene ho gaye hai
 Discussions of his works are held there every day
 is tarah unhen up rajyapal ke pad par kaam karne kaa bhi anubhav ho gaya he
 People are also supporting him because of this
 iske alaava kiran bedi agar dilli kii alji banati hai to wo dilli kii pehali mahila alji hongi
 In such a situation, people on Twitter believe that it will help to change the perception about the safety of women in Delhi and especially in the national capital
 'bedi banaam kejariwal' par kuch phani twitashir Ravindra Jadeja @sirjadeja kaa kahana he, 'agar kiran bedi ko dilli kaa up rajyapal banaaya jaataa he to siem kejariwal istipha de denge

 For the Lok Sabha elections, Congress has formally announced on Saturday that former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh will contest from Bhopal seat
 is elaan se pehle dopaher main hi patrakaron se anaupchaarik baatcheet main mukhyamantri kamalnath ne digvijay kii ummidavaari kaa elaan kar diya tha
 Reacting to Kamal Nath's statement, Digvijay had said that he would like to fight Rajgarh, but also added that he would follow the directions given by the party
 digvijay 2 dafe rajgad se saansad rah chuke hai
 But is Digvijay happy with this decision, when asked this question to CM Kamal Nath, he said that 'you should ask these questions to him, i am happy with this decision
 digvijay party ke pradeshdhyaksh, do dafe mukhyamantri rahe chuke hai aap rajgad se laden to ye baat aappar janchati nahin he
 i had requested him to fight against Bhopal, Jabalpur or Indore
 He said, i think about it
 
 
 phir unhone mujhase kaha aap hi faisla kar len to maine faisla kar liya ki wo bhopal se ladenge
 Digvijay responded in this matter and said that although i am a member of Rajya Sabha till 2020, but if the party wants me to go to the Lok Sabha, my first priority is Rajgarh from where i am also a voter
 lekin uske baavjood bhi maine mere party adhyaksh or pradesh congress yani kamalnathji se kaha he ki jahaan party ladaana chaahegi main vahaan se lard luungaa
 Let me tell you that last week Kamal Nath had said that Digvijay should contest from the most difficult seat of the state
 bhopal pichley 3 dashakon se bijepi kaa garh rahaa he, 1989 ke baad se hue sabhi aath chunaav main bijepi ke ummidavaaron ko yahaan se jeet mila he philhal is seat par bijepi ke alok sanger kaabiz hai
 Sushil Chandra Verma won this seat 3 times since 1989, after which Uma Bharti, and former Chief Minister Kailash Joshi were mps from Bhopal
 charchaa he ki is seat se alok sanger kaa tikat katkar mahaamantri vidi sharma yaa meyar alok sharma ko tikat diya ja saktaa he, lekin digvijay kii ummidavaari ke baad is seat se purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke ladane kii bhi charchaa he
 On the other hand, Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur acquitted in the Malegaon blast case is also beating
 pragna thakur ko saamne utaarne ke sawaal par digvijay ne kaha bijepi jisko ladaana chaahe ladaa le main apana prayaas karuunga
 On the question of bjp's claim and Digvijay's challenge, party spokesperson Rahul Kothari said that any of our nationalist workers can challenge them
 ye congress kii andruni ladaai he jisamen digvijay ko fansaakar haarane ke liye utaara ja rahaa he taaki pradesh kii raajnneeti main unka dakhal khatm ho jaae
 All the voters know his anti-national and divisive image
