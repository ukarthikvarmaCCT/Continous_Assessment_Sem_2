 The number of stray dogs in the country is more than 30 million
 har saal lakhon kii taadaad main ye kute logon ko katate bhi hai
 But this is happening for the first time that things are being said about sudden man-eating of dogs in an area
 itnaa hi nahin ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki ye aadamkhor kute ab tak 13 bacchon kii jaan le chuke hai
 The case is of Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh
 dehshat kaa alam ye he ki ab prashasan ne bacchon ke ghar tak se baahar nikalne par roak lagava di he
 The fear was so much that the Chief Minister himself had to visit that area
 kya aadamkhor kutton ne lee bacchon kii jaan?bharat me teen karod aawaara kute hai
 Every year 20,000 people die in the country due to dog bites
 maut kii vajah banataa he rabies
 The highest number of cases are found in India
 aankadon par najar daalen to ye puri duniya kaa 35 fisadi he
 But now the question is, are the dogs becoming man-eaters now? Are there man-eating dogs killing children in Sitapur? Did the 13 kids kill the dog dogs? Hunting dogs, administration stay indoors
 baahar mat nikalnaa
 Outside are hunting dogs and administrators are ineffective
 usase itnaa bhi nahin ho saktaa ki wo 6 maheene bitne ke baad bhi ye pataa laga saken ki sitapur main 13 bacchon ko maar daalane vaale aadamkhor kute hi hai yaa koi or
 Yes, dogs have made their 7th victim in the Khairabad area in the month of May and thus 13 innocent lives have been lost since November
 bacchon ke liye karfupaise se zakhm bhar jaataa to duniya main dukhi logon kii taadaad bahut kam hoti
 Chief Minister 
 
 aap to ye intjaam kiijie ki ab kisi maa kii god suuni naa ho
 Now no one can take care of innocent animals, because all the capable officers from Lucknow to Mathura and Sitapur administration together are not able to stop the figures of these deaths and on the contrary, the administration has imposed curfew for children in Khairabad
 kutton ke aatank se kaanpata sitapuradamkhor kutton ne kiya 13waan shikaar
 In May alone, dogs killed 7 innocent children
 iske baad 10 saal kii maasoom kutton kaa niwala bani
 In this way, these dogs have become the era of total 13 lives so far
 inaki vajah se sitapur main masuumon ke liye 'karfu' kaa maahaul he
 In addition to the children and children imprisoned in the houses, committees have been formed to block block development officers, village head, accountant, doctors, teachers, kotedars and other people to stop the havoc of man-eating dogs
 magar police encounter, drone camere se nazar or doorabeen kaa asar sab bekaar sabit ho rahaa he
 Dogs are not deterred by their antics
 ab police prashasan kaa kutton par kaabo karnaa mushkil ho rahaa he, to wo bacchon kii padhai likhaai or khel kud band karke ghar main hi kaid rahane kii salaah de rahe hai
 Angry over the death of the innocent, because even after such promptness, the dogs in Khairabad area made 10-year-old innocent Reena a victim
 maasoom rina gaanv ke baahar kheton main apane parivaar ke saath gehun kii baalia binane gai thim
 During this time, a flock of dogs attacked the innocent and scorched him to death
 maasoom rina kii maut se gussaye log kaa gussa foot padaa or puraa kaa puraa gaanv shav ke saath lathi-danda lekar sadak par utar aae
 a crowd of people blocked National Highway 24
 police prashasan vifalpulice-prashasan ne in logon ko samajhane kii koshish to bahut kii
 But how long will these people also understand
 kyonki 13 masuumon kii mauton ke baad bhi ab tak prashasan ek bhi shikari kute kaa pataa nahin laga pai he
 It is not far to find out whether it is a dog or some other wild animal that attacks the children
 ulataa police logon par laathiyaan barasaa kar unhen kaabo karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 This is when Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath himself has visited this area
 mukhyamantri yogike is daure ke mahaz 48 ghante ke andar kutton ne maasoom rina ko apana shikaar banaaya
 It is alleged that in the six months since November, dogs have preyed 12 innocent children here
 jinamein se 6 bacchon ko to sirf may ke shuruuaati hafte main hi jaan ganvaani padi
 Himanshi and Sonam became victims of dogs in November
 janvari main kutton ne mubin ko apana shikaar banaaya
 In February, innocent omen were killed in dog attacks
 march main arbaz or sania par jaanaleva hamalaa hua
 And so far in May, dogs were hunted down by Shawni, Khalid, Komal, Geeta, Virendra and Kasim
 behad ajeeb si hai ye ghatnaayen
 Sudden man-eating of street dogs is shocking
 bas isiilie jitani munh utani baaten ho rahi hai
 Contradicting the statements of the officials, the SP of Sitapur says that dogs are not getting meat, so they are biting humans
 par sawaal ye he ki boojadkhaane to puure upi main band hai
 So why only the dogs of Sitapur are angry? And admittedly, these dogs are angry about not getting food
 to phir ye bacchon ke gardan par sirf hamalaa kar bhaag kyon jate hai? pashu kalyaan adhikari saurabh gupta kaa kahana he ki agar wo kute aadamkhor ho gaye hai to, un kutton ne keval kaata kyon, khaaya kyon nahin?junglee aadamkhor shikari kute!aisa nahin he ki gali ke kute aadamkhor nahin ho sakate
 But this happens only if they lose their mind balance
 par ek saath jhund kaa jhund pagal ho jaae ye bhi to mumkin nahin he
 So the question is, is there anything that the village dogs are considering as someone else? Because no one is saying this about the attack dogs being dogs
 ek chashmadid mahila kaa kahana he ki kute kii tarah the magar ajeeb the
 Some villagers say that dogs who are attacking children
 wo unki gali ke kute nahin balki kheton or baagon main chhupakar rahane vaale bahari shikari kute hai
 Those who have high speed of escape and are very dangerous
 bakriyaan or gaay bhi baniin shikarsitapur ke khayrabad ke 10 kimi ke daayre main jitne bhi gaanv hai, vahaan aatank machaa haa he
 According to the villagers, not only children but also cows and goats are being hunted
 saikadon kii taadaad main bakriyon or darjanon kii taadaad main gaay par in kutton ne jaanaleva hamalaa kiya he
 One officer says the attackers may not be wolves
 hamalavar kute hai yaa koi or?dehshat kaa alam ye he ki bacchon ne skool janaa chhod diya he
 Farmers have stopped going to the fields
 or jo ja bhi rahe hai, wo machaan ke upar chadhe baithe hai
 But the question is, are the attackers really dogs? Or someone else? It is important to get to the bottom of this terror

 The Indian economy completed its worst year in the last decade on December 31, 2012, with a sluggish economic growth rate of 5 per cent and stubborn inflation above 7 per cent
 adarsh sthiti main to sarkaar in aankadon ko ulatakar dekhnaa pasand kartiâ7 fisadi se zyada vruddhi dar or 6 fisadi se kam mahangaai
 But this did not happen in 2012 and there is no reason to believe (as many in the government believes) that this will happen in 2013
 arthvyavastha main nirnaayak sudhaar laane ke liye sirf yah kaaphi nahin he ki kuch sector main epadi kii ijaajat dene vaale vidheyak paarit kar die jaaen, jaise retail, vimaanan (donon main yah ho chukaa he) yaa beemaa or pension (jald hone kii ummid)
 The key to regaining the height of economic growth is to bring the level of private investment (percentage of GDP) to a record level of 2007-08
 jab arthvyavastha kareeb 9 fisadi kii dar se bad rahi thi, to nijee nivesh kaa jidipi main hissaa 36 fisadi tak tha
 Now when the economy is growing 5
 5 fisadi ke aasapaas he to nijee nivesh kaa jidipi main hissaa ghatakar 30 fisadi ke aasapaas rah gaya he
 The priority for 2013 should be to make domestic investment particularly high
 iske liye sarkaar ko teen tarah kii katautee kii ranneeti apnaani hogiâbyaaj daron main katautee, vittiya ghate main katautee or bade projects kii manjuuri main lagane vaali deree main katautee
 Reduction in interest rates: The cost of capital is a major factor influencing the decision of Indian business
 arabiai ne march 2010 se july 2011 ke bich byaaj daron main 11 baar badhotaree kii he or is dauraan usne byaaj dar ko 4
 Increased from 75 per cent to 8 per cent
 is tarah se pichley do saal main karj lene kii laagat 3
 Has gone up by 25 per cent, at a time when the market for business was shrinking both abroad (global slowdown) and India (sluggishness from policy paralysis)
 kendriya bank ne mahangaai ke khilaaf nirarthak ladaai main byaaj daron main badhotaree kii he, jabaki sachaai yah he ki mahangaai kaa byaaj daron ke str se bahut kam lenaa-dena hota he
 This is largely due to reduced supply in the agricultural economy (this increases food-related inflation) and the government's huge financial deficit (which leads to higher non-food inflation)
 mahangaai to kuch had tak control bhi hui he (9 se ghatakar 7 fisadi se thodi zyada), lekin 2012 ke zyaadaatar hisse main audyogic utpaadan main badhat kii jagah giravat ai he
 RBI Governor D
 subbarao ne lagaataar do vitt mantriyon pranab mukherjee or pi
 Ignoring Chidambaram, both wanted that interest rates should be cut in 2012 itself
 ab yah ummid kii ja rahi he ki ve aakhirkaar janvari 2013 main kuch naram pad sakate hai, jab arabiai apni maudrik niti kii agali samiksha pesh karegaa
 If interest rates are cut in January, it will be modest
 nijee nivesh main yadi phir se teji lani he to is saal arabiai ko lagaataar aisi kai katautiyaan kerani hongi
 Reduce the fiscal deficit chidambaram ko farvari main pesh hone ja rahe bajet main sarkaar ke vittiya ghate main kami laane kii ek vishwasaneey yojana kii ghoshnaa kerani hogi
 This will be the last budget of the UPA government before the proposed general elections in May 2014
 chunaav purv bajet main to kam kharch vaale nirnaayak upayon kii bajaae is baat kaa dabaav hota he ki kharch karne vaale loklubhaavan kaaryakramon kii ghoshnaa kii jaae
 Congress president Sonia Gandhi will pressurize the government into announcing her favorite food security bill, which will cost the exchequer Rs 30,000 crore every year
 kaa atirikt boj padegaa or pehle hi kaabo se baahar ho chukaa vittiya ghaataa 3 fisadi ke suvidhajanak str kii jagah jidipi ke kareeb 6 fisadi tak pahunch jayega
 Chidambaram will have to find some fundamental avenues to cut costs
 dijal keemton ko puri tarah se niyantranmukt karnaa nishchit rup se unki praathamikta suchi main hona chahie
 Taking advantage of the boom in the stock market, they should definitely disinvest major public sector companies
 tex main thodi badhotaree sambhav he
 Excise duty may increase
 yadi vitt mantri nirast 2ji license kii phir se nilaamee ke liye vaazib keemat tay kar pate hai to isse ghate ko kam karne main madad milegi
 The government's plan for fast approval of infrastructure projects (mostly linked to the environment ministry) was to set up a National Investment Board under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, but at the end of 2012, the cabinet committee on investment (CCI) was reduced
 come across as
 adangha daalane vaali jayanti natarajan kii adhyakshata vaale paryaavaran or van mantralay ne manjuuri ke apane adhikaar pradhanmantri ko saunpane se inkaar kiya he
 Nevertheless, senior ministers of the CCI will have to use their seniority to force the environment ministry to get the projects cleared faster
 infrastracchar projects yadi green license raaj main fanse rahe to agle paanch saal main upie 8
 Will not be able to achieve the target of 2 percent economic growth, which is being played again and again
 2009 main upie ko duusari baar satta mili thi kyonki usne paanch saal ke kaarykaal main salanaa 8 fisadi kii aarthik badhat hasil karke dikhaai thi
 This time UPA 2 does not have much time to reach an average rate of 8 per cent
 lekin yadi vruddhi dar 6 fisadi se neeche or mahangaai 7 fisadi se upar rahi to bhi vah chunaav jeetne kii ummid nahin kar saktaa
 This is the only reason why there is hope that the government will do something to revive the economy in 2013
 sena ne seemaa paar se poonch jile main ghuspaith karne vaale ek pakistani naagarik ko giraftaar kiya he

 The BJP had promised to give above 50 percent MSP to the farmers
 unhone chetavanee di ki jaise bhartiya sainikon ne seemaa par sargical hamale ko anjaam diya tha, usee tarah krishi samudaay bhi jab tak nyaay nahin mil jaataa sarkaar ke khilaaf 'sargical strike' karegaa
 Questioning the huge increase in the prices of petrol and diesel, the Aam Aadmi Party has now targeted the Modi government at the Center
 'aap' netaaon ne bayaan jari karte hue poocha he ki jab antarrashtriya bazaar main kaccha tel sasta he to baavjood iske petrol-deazal ke daam shikhar par kyon hai?'aap' pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne apane bayaan main tazaa aankadon kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki aaj dilli main petrol ke daam â¹76
 There are 24, â¹ 78 in Kolkata
 91 he, chennai main â¹79
 13, while in Mumbai â¹ 84
 07 hai
 However, the price of crude oil in the international market has come down significantly compared to the year 2013
 samaj nahin aata ki jab crude oil ke daam main giravat ai he to bhartiya bazaar main petrol-deazal ke daam kam karne kii bajaae badaye kyon ja rahe hai?aam aadmi party kaa kahana he ki'bahut hui mahangaai kii maar abaki baar modi sarkaar'kaa naaraa dekar, janata se vot mangakar satta main ai modi sarkaar ne desh kii janata ke saath vishwasghaat kiya he
 Ever since the Modi government came to power, be it petrol-diesel, domestic gas, or food and drink, inflation has broken all records
 'aap' pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki "saal 2013 main jab dollar ke mukaable rupaya â¹63
 When it was 88, the price of crude oil in the international market was around $ 109 per barrel, then in Delhi, the price of petrol was 69 rupees and diesel was around 64 rupees
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki jab centre main modi sarkaar satta main ai to kachche tel kii keemat ghatakar ek samay 30 dollar prati bairal ho bhi gai, lekin piem modi ne aam aadmi ko koi raahat nahin di"aam aadmi party kaa aarope he ki jab se modi sarakar satta main ai he lagbhag 200% exise duty petrol par or lagbhag 450% excise duty deazal par badhai ja chuki he
 AAP leaders say that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should apologize to the people of the country because unlike the election promises, the BJP government at the Center has failed to reduce the price of petrol diesel
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke dream project khaadya suraksha bill par gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne ek baar phir joardaar hamalaa bolaa he
 Modi has alleged that this is a bill to snatch food from the poor
 isse pichde logon ko phayda nahin hone vaale he
 The truth is that through this the government is snatching the food of the poor
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle narendra modi ne somvaar ko khaadya suraksha bill ke maujuuda praaroop par etraj jataate hue pradhanmantri ko chitthee bhi likhi thi
 Modi appealed to the PM to call a meeting of all the Chief Ministers on the issue
 mangalvaar ko manmohan singh par hamlawar rukh apanaate hue narendra modi ne kaha, 'agar yah bill lagu hota he to garibi rekha se neeche rah rahe pariwaron ko 10 kilo kam anaaj milegaa
 That is, they will be forced to buy the ration of the month from the market, which will affect their annual budget, so how did this bill go in favor of the poor? ânarendra Modi said,â i wrote a letter to the PM regarding the shortcomings of this bill
 par aisa lagata he ki is mudde par sarkaar kaa ravaiya hi dhilaa he
 Government ministers are making big claims, but the reality is different
 pehle bipiel pariwaron ko 35 kilo anaaj miltaa tha
 But according to this bill, a family of 5 will get only 25 kg of food grains monthly
 'narendra modi ne kaha, 'centre sarkaar ko is mudde par sabhi mukhyamantriyon kii baithak bulani chahie
 Because according to this bill it will be the responsibility of the state governments to distribute food grains among the poor
 aise main anaaj kahaan se aayegaa, uske liye paisa koun degaa
 The bill will be based on which model
 pehle se kai rajyon main aisi yojanaayen lagu hai
 There should be clarity on all these points
 'unhone upie ko chetavanee dete hue kaha, 'sarkaar ke liye behatar hoga ki wo jitani jaldi ho sake garibon kii jarurat ko samajhe
 ' input bhashaa se

 The cbi's plea to remove the name of former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan from the list of accused in the Adarsh scam case has been rejected by a special court
 sibiai adaalat ke nyaayadhish es ji dighe ne yachika khaarij karte hue kaha, âsibiai kii yachika khaarij kii jaati he
 'the judge said that Governor K
 shankaranarayanan dwaara chavaan ke khilaaf abhiyog ke anumodan kii sibiai kii yachika ko khaarij kiye jane ke baavjood, unpar (chavaan par) bhrashtachar nirodhi kanoon ke tahat maamla chalaaya ja saktaa he kyonki unpar aapraadhik kadachaar ke aarope hai
 The judge will issue a detailed order in this regard
 apane tark rakhte hue vishesh sarkari vakil bharat badami ne kaha ki sibiai ko purv mukhyamantri ke khilaaf abhiyog lagane main âbahut khushiâ hogi lekin âhamaari haath bandhe hue hai
 He said that there is no provision in the law to appeal against the Governor's refusal to grant permission, but if the agency finds any additional evidence against Chavan, it will definitely request the Governor to review his decision
 rajyapal ke faisle ko âgaiyr-apiliâ bataate hue sibiai ne 15 janvari ko ek aavedan daayar karke adarsh maamle main aarope patr main shaamil 13 aropiyon kii suchi se chavaan kaa naam hataane kii anumati maangi thi
 The verdict on this application was reserved till January 18
 sibiai kii yachika yadi adaalat dwaara sweekaar kar lee jaati to isse congress or chavaan donon ko hi badi raahat milti
 Chavan is the only chief minister who has been accused in the case

 Deshmukh has died
 rajya sarkaar ke nyaayik jaanch ayog ne in teenon ko hi adarsh houseing socity ko vibhinn manzooriyaan dene se jude praavdhaanon kaa âghor ulanghanâ karne kaa abhiyog lagaaya tha

" sadsyta kii prakriya spasht taur par darshaati he ki chavaan ne jaruri anumati ko jo sahmati di thi, vah kisi cheez ke badale main di gai thi
 Chavan, who was forced to step down as chief minister after the scandal surfaced, challenged the inclusion of his name in the charge sheet on the ground that no sanction was taken from the governor for the indictment
 sibiai ne kaha ki chunki aarope patr main shaamil kiye jate samay ve ek purv mukhyamantri the, isliye rajyapal se anumati jaruri nahin thi
 Governor K
 shankaranarayanan dwaara inkaar kar die jane par adaalat ne agency ko aadesh die the ki vah chavaan ke abhiyojan ke liye anumati le
 After this, the CBI had no option but to close the case against Chavan
 sibiai ne apane aaropapatr main aarope lagaaya tha ki chavaan ne vivadagrast adarsh socity main apane sambandhiyon ke liye flats hasil karne ke badale floor spes index badhaayaa tha
 As Revenue Minister, Chavan also asked the housing society to include 40 percent of the citizens
 jabaki yah socity mulat: yuddh ke sipaahiyon ke liye thi
 The CBI had claimed that Chavan played a key role in the scam
 is socity main chavaan kii saas bhagwati sharma, saali seemaa sharma or sasur ke bhai madanlaal sharma ke flats hai
 The judicial panel disqualified them all from acquiring flats in the society
 july 2012 main daayar kiye gaye apane aaropapatr main sibiai ne chavaan or 12 anya ko bhartiya dand samhita or bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon ke tahat aapraadhik shadyantra, dhokhadhadi or aapraadhik kadachaar kaa aaropee bataaya tha

 odisha kii rajdhani bhubaneshwar main bijepi kaa manch sajaa tha
 The occasion was a meeting of the National Executive
 15 or 16 april 2017 ko yojit is do divasiy baithak main jab bolne kii baari ai to adhyaksh amit shah ne sabko chaunkaa diya
 He bluntly told the party leaders that you people should not be forgotten in any way, the golden period of BJP has not yet come
 amit shah kaa bayaan isliye bhi chaunkaane vaala tha ki kaaryakarini se pehle bijepi ke 'rajmukut' main badi jeet ke kai nagine jud chuke the
 Whether to reach power at the Center by majority in 2014 or to form government in states like Haryana, Maharashtra
 vahiin bhubaneshwar main hui is kaaryakarini kii baithak se ek maheene pehle hi party ne desh ke sabase bade soobe uttar pradesh main vijay pataakaa fahraaya tha
 In that meeting, Amit Shah had given a message to the party leaders to work hard and said - 'when we won in 2014, people said that BJP has reached the climax
 2017 main bhi yahi kaha gaya, magar party kaa charmotkarsh abhi baaki he
 We imagine that there should be a government in every state
 panchayat se parlyament tak 'bhaajapaaraj' hona chahie
 At that time Amit Shah also linked bjp's golden period to the golden period of the country
 2019 main bhi khud ko shikhar par nahin pate shah2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main prachand bahumat se jeet ke baad bhi amit shah party ko shikhar par nahin pate hai
 At a meeting of party officials on Thursday (june 13) at the Delhi headquarters of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Amit Shah reiterated the Bhubaneswar executive meeting in 2017
 unhone kaha ki abhi bijepi safalataa ke shikhar par nahin pahunchi he
 The statement came at a time when the BJP under modi-shah has equaled the Indira Gandhi-led Congress' record in forming two stable governments in a row
 vahiin teen dashak baad desh main bahumat kii sarkaar banane kaa silsilaa shuru hua he
 Also, with 303 seats, BJP is at its best ever
 1984 kaa record todna chaahate hai shah?2014 or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main banpar bahumat se bijepi kii sarkaar banane par bhi kyon santusht nahin hai amit shah? bijepi ke sutara kehete hai ki is sawaal kaa jawaab bijepi ke naare 'abaki baar chaar sau paar' main chipa he
 BJP sources say that the BJP had set a target of winning 400 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 kai netaa reliyon main yah naaraa dete the
 Even though the BJP won a landslide victory, the target of winning more than four hundred seats was not met
 is adhuri khwaahish ko ab 2024 main puraa karne kii taiyaari he
 a senior party official says in a conversation with Aajtak
in - As far as i am aware that Amit Shah wants to break the Congress's record of winning 414 seats in 1984
 desh ke sansadeey chunaavon ke itihaas main yah sabase badi jeet rahi he
 After the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984, Congress contested under the leadership of Rajiv Gandhi
 tab indira gandhi kii hatya par upji sahanubhuti kii lahar par savaar hokar congress ne sabase badi jeet kaa record banaaya tha
 BJP had won two seats in that election
 or kya chaahate hai shahakhir or kitni safalataa chaahate hai shah? is sawaal ke jawaab main bijepi ke ek rashtriya str ke padaadhikari odisha kii kaaryakarini main amit shah ke bhaashan kii taraf ishaara karte hai
 In which Amit Shah says that the climax of the party will be only when there is a government in every state
 kaabilegaur he ki bijepi or endie kii is vakt desh ke 17 rajyon main sarkaar he
 The BJP has also reached power in the states of the Northeast
 yahaan tak ki vampanth ke garh tripura par bhi bijepi kaa kabja ho chukaa he
 But the fort of the south is still far from the BJP
 party sutara bataate hai ki amit shah, pashchim bengal, odisha, tamilnadu, telugana, andhra pradesh or kerala jaise pramukh rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar banane kii thaan chuke hai
 In such a situation, after the bjp's capture of the power of these states, it is possible that Amit Shah's statement that the BJP is now at the peak of success
 bijepi tod sakati he recordbijepi sutron kaa maananaa he ki amit shah kii mehnat or ranneeti ke dam par bijepi 1984 main congress ke 414 siten jeetne ke record ko tod sakati he
 Party leaders also believe that in 2019 the BJP has reached 303 seats on its own, while the NDA has won 353 seats
 congress sahit sabhi vipakshi dal post pade hai
 The opposition lacks both strong faces and unity
 aise main chaar sau se zyada siten jeetna naammumkin nahin he
 Perhaps this is the reason why the party wants Amit Shah to be the BJP President along with being the Home Minister
 jisase party aage or badi jeet kaa record bana sake

 "he has to stand with France
 house aaf kaamans main kuch hafton main is par matdaan hoga ki britain ko syria main hawaii hamalon main hissaa lenaa chahie yaa nahin
 The lawmakers in 2013 rejected a proposal for airstrikes against the Syrian government's military
 lekin, baad main iraq main aies par hamale kii ijaajat de di thi
 The Cameron government says it is unreasonable to limit the action to Iraq, as IS does not recognize the boundaries between countries

 Apart from this, the reason being stated is that less women do not want to survive in the already shrinking employment market which is dominated by men

 Both leaders strongly expressed their views on the issue of Citizenship Amendment Act and NRC
 ek ore nakvi ne is kanoon ko lagu karne ke peeche sarkaar kii manshaa ke bare main bataaya
 On the other hand, Owaisi, opposing this, caught the attention of the government of their flaws
 ovaisi ne kaha ki hamen teen mulkon ke alpsankhyak hinduon ko naagarikta dene se koi dikkat nahin he, sarkaar chaahe to pakistan ke saare hinduon ko bulaakar naagarikta de sakati he
 But the law that has come into force on religious grounds is against the Constitution
 kya narendra modi or amit shah kii jaankaree nehru, ambedkar, sardaar patel or rajendra prasad se bhi zyada he, jinhone desh kaa samvidhan lagu kiya tha
 They are going to do the work that these people did not do
 alpsankhyakon ke saath hoga bhedbhaavovaisi ne kaha ki is kanoon se hindustan ke alpsankhyakon ke saath bhedbhaav hoga kyonki siee or enarasi ko saath dekhnaa jaruri he
 If any Hindu and Muslim name does not appear in the NRC, then the Hindu will survive but the Muslim will not survive
 pehle sarkaar ko enarasi lagu karnaa chahie tha
 The government is going to set 120 crore people in the country and then everyone will be asked to make documents abroad
 nakvi ne enarasi par jawaab dete hue kaha ki aisa nahin ho saktaa ki kisi ke paas jaruri dastavejon main se ek bhi dastavej na ho
 Yet those who are out of the NRC will be given the opportunity to appeal, the right to go to the tribunal
 unhone kaha ki siee desh ke nagarikon ke liye nahin he balki teen deshon ke alpsankhyakon ke liye yah kanoon laayaa gaya he, aap enarasi or naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ko jodakar nahin dekh sakate
 Because of the constitution, Secular Bharathankavi said that after partition, Hindus were majority in India and Muslims in Pakistan, but Hindus of the country made India not a Hindu country but a secular country whereas Pakistan became an Islamic country because of majority Muslims
 unhone kaha ki hindustan ke hinduon ke dilon main dharmanirpekshata or sahishnutaa he tabhi yah mulk duniya main sabase zyada taqatvar he
 Owaisi said that because Hindus want this country is not secular but because it is secular because we have made our Constitution like this
 unhone nakvi se kaha ki aap pakistan se milakar hindustan kii tauheen kar rahe hai, yah samvidhan secular he or isliye bharat secular desh bana
 Owaisi said that if a decision comes under the constitution, the same constitution also allows us to challenge it and we have done the same in the Ayodhya case

 samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav apane raajnneetik daavon ke liye jane jate hai
 When he released the list of 325 candidates on Wednesday, there is a clear glimpse of many political messages and strategies
 darasal, mulaayam is suchi ke zarie kai tarah ke santulan banane kii koshish karte nazar aa rahe hai
 At the same time, he is also giving a direct indication to other potential allies that if there is an alliance, it will be on their terms only
 samaajawaadee party main pichley kuch maheenon se jari ghamaasan main rajya ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav or party ke pradesh adhyaksh shivpal yadav aamane-saamne hai
 In this battle of uncle and nephew, the party has been in constant discussion for some time
 haalanki is ladaai ke baad akhilesh or majboot hokar ubhare hai or party ke saath-saath sarkaar main bhi unki haisiyat or majboot hui he
 Shivpal is not only weak in the party, but his credibility is also weak among the people
 lekin netaji yah bakhubi jaanate hai ki kisi ek pahie ke kamazor padane se baat banane vaali nahin he
 Nor does Netaji want to allow the rebellion to be raised just before the election
 isliye mulaayam kii list party or satta ke saath-saath chachaa or bhattije ke bich santulan kii bhi koshish he
 Before the list was released by Balanamulayam Singh Yadav in the house, Akhilesh and Shivpal had released their own list of choice
 lekin netaji kii suchi main donon kii list kii chhap he
 However, Shivpal has fallen heavily on Akhilesh and Mulayam has not disappointed him
 niraash hone kaa samay akhilesh kaa he
 But Netaji's political bet is also behind this
 akhilesh ko agar jeet kii ore badhanaa he to unhen party or parivaar ke saath kii zarurat he
 Shivpal has always been the commander of Mulayam and he has a strong hold on the organization
 netaji ko maaloom he ki akhilesh ke jeetne ke liye shivpal kaa puri tarah se jutana or saath hona bahut zaruri he
 At the same time, they also understand that if there is complete neglect of Shivpal even in the tickets, then he will not remain anywhere and can be a rebel in this situation
 party or parivaar main baghawat mulaayam ke liye is samay ek kathin chunauti sabit ho sakati he
 By incorporating Shivpal's names, Mulayam has done him gratitude and now Shivpal will have no other option but to join hands with Netaji and Akhilesh
 party ke ek varisht netaa is sthiti ko samajhaate hai, âparty main akhilesh mukhyamantri pad ke sabase prabal daavedaar hai
 Shivpal cannot be their answer
 isliye jo aaj shivpal kii list ke log lag rahe hai, kal akhilesh ko gaddi tak pahunchane kaa kaam karenge
 Shivpal's happiness is not at all harmful for Akhilesh
 âdekhnaa yah he ki akhilesh is faisle ke saath kaise dhairya or jeet, donon tarah ke sanket apane samarthakon or baaki soobe ko de pate hai kyonki akhilesh kaa majboot se kamazor hona yaa netaji kaa un par haaavee hona antat sapa ke chunavi ganit ke liye acha nahin hoga
 The second bet of alliance is played by Netaji with the aggressive parties for cooperation
 aise samay main jabaki congress or anya raajnneetik dal gathbandhan ke liye samaajawaadee party kii ore aas lagaae dekh rahe hai, netaji baar-baar yah doharaa rahe hai ki wo akele dam par chunaav main utrenge bhi or jeetenge bhi
 Now with the announcement of 325 candidates, Netaji has brought the allies to the coalition
 78 siton ke liye koi ghoshnaa netaji ne nahin kii he jo ishaara he ki abhi bhi gathbandhan kii gunjaaish baaki he
 But at the same time he has also indicated that if any political party has to form an alliance with the Samajwadi Party, it will be only and only on their terms
 amethi or raibareli kii paanch siton par apane pratyaashiyon kii ghoshnaa karke netaji ne sambhavit gathbandhan ke sabase bade ghatak congress ko bhi bataa diya he ki wo kisi bhi keemat par unki sharton yaa dabaav main kaam karne vaale nahin he
 It has also been pointed out that whoever wants to combine, should do so with a limited number of 78s
 netaji ne 325 kaa aankada isliye apane kabze main rakhaa taaki chunaav main party ke samarthan main yadi koi lahar ban paati he to bahumat yaa uske kareeb kii sankhya unki apni party se hi nikaala ja sake
 They want to keep their dependence on other parties to a minimum
 netajicongresske saath ajeeb khel khel rahe hai
 They want to spoil Mayawati's dalit-muslim arithmetic with the Congress, but are not ready to give Congress its share in return
 haalanki mulaayam ke angan main daanv kabhi bhi badal jate hai
 Today's truth will be right up to the election door, it cannot be said at all
 3- do hazaar ke noton kii dizin thik rakhane se atm main nahin karnaa padataa sudhaar Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that the benefit of promotion will reach all the people only when corruption is eliminated or it can be controlled
 patna sthit mukhyamantri awaas ek ane maarg main yojit daavat-e-iftaar samaaroh ke avasar par patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue nitish ne kaha ki tarakkee kaa laabh sabhi logon tak tabhi pahonchega jab bhrashtachar samaapt hoga athwa usapar kaabo paaya ja sake

 Nitish said that these days the holy month of Ramadan is going on and our Muslim siblings spend this month with a lot of rules and sanctity which is respected by all those who believe in religion
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki ham sab bharatvasi hai or ek samaaj ke ang hai or is tarah kii daavat ke aayojan se aapasi meljol or ekadusre ke prati samaj evam sammaan badhata he
 He said that iftar was organized by the state government in the years 2006 and 2007 but it was not being done for the last three years because in view of the Koshi tragedy in the year 2008 and the drought situation in the state in 2009 and 2010, this The type program was not organized
 mukhyamantri kii is daavat main rajyapal devanand kunwar tathaa vipakshi dal rajd ke netaa abdul baari siddiki or gulam gaus ke shaamil hone ke bare main puche jane par nitish ne kaha ki rajyapal to sarkaar evam rajya ke abhinn ang hai
 He said that whether there is a ruling party or opposition there is no politics on this day, yesterday they were in power and today we are in power
 aaj ke din dalgat raajnneeti ho yaa kisi prakaar kaa bhedbhaav ho sabko mitaakar aise pavitra evam tap ke maheene main ek-duusare ko daavat dete hai
 Replying to a question asked about the absence of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad during the Chief Minister's Iftar feast, Nitish said that the feast was given to all but they could not come due to the Parliament session being held

" dhoni ne ab tak 36 test maichon main captaini bhi kii he, jinamein se 17 main unhen jeet mili
 Today's revelations of Dhoni suggest that he wants to tell what he thinks about his future in this game
 isse pehle unhone kaha tha ki vah 2013 tak yah faisla kar lenge ki unhen australia or newjiland main 2015 main hone vaale vishwa cap main khelnaa he yaa nahin

 i have to decide by the end of 2013 whether i am fit enough to play in a format
 yah faisla nijee nahin, balki desh kii khatir hoga, kyonki meri jagah jo bhi wicketiper legaa use vishwa cap main jane se pehle kam se kam 70 se 80 vanade kaa anubhav hona chahie
 This is my belief
 ââ The 30-year-old Dhoni is considered a good one-day captain and an impressive batsman

 congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra uttar pradesh main party ko chust durust karne ke liye kadi mehnat kar rahi hai
 It can be estimated from this that around 1 pm on Tuesday afternoon
 20 baje se shuru hui unki baithak buudhvaar al subah 5
 It ended at 15
 in kareeb 16 ghanton ke dauraan vah bina lunch or dinar ke lagaataar party kaaryakartaaon se vichaar vimarsh karti raheen
 Priyanka Gandhi bluntly told the party workers that the old Congress will not work with the Congress
 party ko nae sire se shuruyaat kerani he
 Priyanka Gandhi's meeting in Lucknow started at 1:20 pm on Tuesday afternoon and lasted till 5:15 pm on Wednesday
 priyanka jaipur se lagbhag 12:45 par amausi airport pahunchin or sidhe congress daftar ain
 He neither launched nor dinner
 lagaataar back tu back meeting karti raheen
 Party workers say that she is fiercely taking a class of party members
 baithak ke dauraan jab phulpur ke logon ne aagrah kiya ki vah phulpur se chunaav laden to priyanka ne kaha ki bahut jagahon se yah dabaav aa rahaa he ki main chunaav laduun lekin main chunaav nahin laduungi, sanghathan ko majboot karuungi
 After listening to the work of East Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka patiently listened to the workers in the meeting
 alam yah tha ki ek kaaryakarta ko 5 se 15 minute tak bolne kaa vakt diya gaya tha
 If a worker could have taken more time, Priyanka was listening to him
 priyanka ne kaha ki main aapke dil kii baat sunne ai hum
 You say your whole thing
 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, after attending Congress committee meeting in Lucknow: I'm learning a lot about the organisation, its structure and the changes that need to be made
 I'm getting their (congress workers) views on how to fight election, according to them

 She said that when she reached Rae Bareli and Amethi, there was a problem of the committee there too
 har cameti main jarurat se zyada logon kii maine chatni kii
 The same formula will be implemented in the state
 lekin abhi loksabhaa chunaav sar par he or time kam he
 The organization will be reshuffled only after 2019
 tab tak kaaryakartaaon ko ji jaan se koshish kerani hogi
 No Selfieh was the first time that Congress workers were meeting Priyanka in this way
 sabhi selfi lene ke liye betaab the, magar espiji ne unako samajhaayaa ki selfi lene kii anumati nahin he
 It is forbidden to take selfies in view of security
 har baithak ke ant main priyanka ne kaaryakartaaon ke saath group photo khinchaai jo aupchaarik rup se party kii taraf se bheji jaaegi
 The demand for contesting elections from Lucknow said, 'I will work to strengthen the organization
 ' yah baat unhone lakhanu sansadeey kshetra ke liye banaai gai donon tiimon se kahi
 Actually, the workers had appealed to him to contest from Lucknow
 is par priyanka ne poocha ki aap main se koun chunaav ladanaa chahta he
 Interestingly, the activists also appealed to Lucknow not to give tickets to any celebrity or outsider
 aayaa ram gaya ram ko miltaa he zyada mahatvabaithak main kaaryakartaaon ne dal badalu netaaon ko party main bade padon par asin kiye jane par bhi dukh jataayaa
 On which Priyanka said that it will be my endeavor to pay attention to the grassroots activists like those who are raising slogans outside
 gauratlab he ki rahul gandhi ne bhi road sho ke baad apane bhaashan main kaha tha ki helicopter vaale netaaon se congress kaa kaam nahin chalegaa
 Ground leaders will get a chance
 unhone kaaryakartaaon ko hidaayat di kii party main gutbaji band ho or sab ekajute hokar 2019 kii ladaai laden
 Priyanka also said that she will form her government in UP in 2022
 kisi bhi kriti yani rachana kii safalataa pathakon, darshakon or shrotaaon kii pratikriya ke aadhaar par tay hoti he
 The success of books and novels now not only determines the reviews, but has also become the standard for the best selling category
 haalanki, kuch kitaaben aisi hoti hai ki jo samiksha ke itar pathak usase apane aap ko is kadar conect karata he, ki na vah sirf use padhata he, balki kaiyon ko sajest bhi karata he
 Today in this episode, there is a book- 'madaripur Junction'
 balendu dvivedi kii rachana 'madaripur jankshan' kitaab na sirf samiksha kii kasuti par khadi utarati he, balki pathakon ko bhi gaanv or india se itar bharat ke paridrishy ko samajhane main madadgaar sabit hoti he
 In fact, it is neither easy to put an incident or the landscape of the country-age in front of everyone in an easy and simple way, nor are most people in this genre like Srilal Shukla, Harishankar Parsai and Premchand, who are satirical and zealous Take the entire expression with a single word
 agar aap shrilaal shukla kii kitaab raag darbari padhi hogi, to aap ise uskaa nayaa varjan hi paaenge
 However, satire has never been so easy
 kyonki vyang kab phuharta or ashleelata ke rang main rang jaataa he, ye koi nahin jaanata
 But the way Balendu Dwivedi weaves the sarcasm of the book at Madaripur Junction while keeping his satirical style within the limits of literature, he stops believing that this is Balendu's first work
 sach kahuun to bhashaa, pravaah, style or aanchalikta kaa utkrisht udhaaharan he yah madaripur jankshan
 Not only this, Madaripur Junction is a tremendous confluence of satire, adventure and romance
 ab agar madaripur jankshan kii baat karen to yah puri tarah se gramin parivesh kaa chithran he, jise lekhak ne vishesh taur par uttar bharat ke hindi bhashi kshetra kii ore ishaara kiya he
 That is, Madaripur Junction is a great example of imaginativeness which the reader can relativise from his village while reading
 agar pathak gaanv or uske parivesh se parichit he to sach kahuun to yah upanyaas sidhe taur par sahaj tareeke se uske man main samaa jayega or use apane gaanv kii tasviir saaf-saaf dikhaai degi
 Actually, this novel is an excellent attempt to explain the surroundings of Madaripur village and its characters
 isamen gaanv or asli bhartiya parivesh ko usee rup main chitrit karne ke liye lekhak ne un shabdon or gaaliyon kaa bhi prayog kiya he, jise hamaare samaaj main aam-bol chaal main prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 But it is worth noting that the writer has not forced those words here, but on the demand of place, characters and surroundings, the writer has used those abuses and zonal words
 upanyaas madaripur ke pradhan pad ke do daavedaar bairangi babu or chhedi babu ke bich aapasi varchasv vaale sangharsh kii ek shandaar katha he
 That is, Madaripur Junction is mainly revolving around these two characters, but the characters are such that they do not let the rhythm of the novel break anywhere
 chhedi babu or bairangi babu bachapan ke dost hote hai, dur ke rishte main chachaa-bhatija hote hai or phir baad main dushman to hote hai
 Romance in the novel is depicted in a very good way from the beginning
 darasal, madaripur main ek bhaaluu baba hote hai, jo kehane ko to baba hai, magar hai to bade vaale rasiyaa
 In the Rasiya context, bears are worshipers of Baba Pagoda
 ye baba kam ganjeri or gangerion ke sardaar zyada hote hai
 They are of such a mood that it is an important part of their daily routine to see women bathing in a nearby pond
 magar ek din isi kii vajah se unki aisi pitayee hoti he ki koi jaan bhi nahin paata ki aakhir gaanv se bhaaluu baba gayi kahaan?tippaniyan In another context, the author has tried to portray the era when rumors about vasectomy used to spark rumors in society
 aaj kal jis tarah se soshal media ke jamaane main afvaah kii samskruti viksit ho rahi he, isaki baangi madaripur jankshan main saaf dekhi ja sakati he
 Actually, one day the media people come to the village, then there is such a wind in the village that sterilization has come and the government is forcibly sterilizing everyone
 isamen ek ke baad ek kai saare aise rochak or praasangik prasang he ki pathak kitaab ko ek pal ke liye bhi apane se dur kar paane kii sthiti main nahin hota he or use ant-ant tak jakade rakhti he
 In the novel, you may have to face it again and again with Chavanni and Athanni Patti, so do not get confused
 chhedi babu jahaan chavanni pattee main varchasv rakhte hai, vahiin bairangi babu atthanni pattee main
 Actually, both these strips are the axes of the village in the novel
 gaanv main pradhani pad kaa chunavi ghamaasan is upanyaas kaa kendriya ghatnakram he or iske do mukhya paatr hai chhedi babu or bairangi babu
 To be fair, Madaripur Junction keeps Pathak tied to the end
 isamen ek bhi aisa prasang nahin he jo pathak ko lage ki lekhak ne jabaran ghusaaya he
 Madaripur Junction reflects the basic concept of Indian rural society, which probably still resides in villages a little
 isliye pathak ko yah padhate vakt iskaa ehsaas jarur hoga

 Actually, one day the media people come to the village, then there is such a wind in the village that sterilization has come and the government is forcibly sterilizing everyone
 isamen ek ke baad ek kai saare aise rochak or praasangik prasang he ki pathak kitaab ko ek pal ke liye bhi apane se dur kar paane kii sthiti main nahin hota he or use ant-ant tak jakade rakhti he
 In the novel, you may have to face it again and again with Chavanni and Athanni Patti, so do not get confused
 chhedi babu jahaan chavanni pattee main varchasv rakhte hai, vahiin bairangi babu atthanni pattee main
 Actually, both these strips are the axes of the village in the novel
 gaanv main pradhani pad kaa chunavi ghamaasan is upanyaas kaa kendriya ghatnakram he or iske do mukhya paatr hai chhedi babu or bairangi babu
 To be fair, Madaripur Junction keeps Pathak tied to the end
 isamen ek bhi aisa prasang nahin he jo pathak ko lage ki lekhak ne jabaran ghusaaya he
 Madaripur Junction reflects the basic concept of Indian rural society, which probably still resides in villages a little
 isliye pathak ko yah padhate vakt iskaa ehsaas jarur hoga
 Now, if we talk about Madaripur Junction, it is a depiction of a completely rural environment, which the author has specifically pointed to the Hindi speaking region of North India
 yani ki madaripur jankshan ek kalpanashiltaa kaa ek behtareen udhaaharan he jise padhate vakt pathak apane gaanv se rilate kar saktaa he
 If the reader is familiar with the village and its surroundings, then to tell the truth, this novel will go straight into his mind in a simple manner and he will clearly see the picture of his village
 darasal, shuru main yah upanyaas madaripur gaanv ke parivesh or uske paatro ko samajhane kii behtareen koshish he
 In this, the author has also used words and abuses which are used in our society in common language to depict the village and the real Indian environment
 lekin gaur karne vaali baat he ki lekhak ne un shabdon ko yahaan jabardastee feet nahin kiya he, balki sthaan, paatr or parivesh kii maang par lekhak ne un gaaliyon or aanchalik shabdon kaa istemaal kiya he
 The novel is a glorious tale of a mutual dominated struggle between Bairagi Babu and Chedi Babu, the two contenders for the post of Madaripur
 yani ki madaripur jankshan mukhya rup se inhen do paatro ke ird-gird ghumti jarur he, magar kirdaar aise-aise hai jo kahin bhi upanyaas ke lay ko todane nahin dete
 Chedi Babu and Bairagi Babu are childhood friends, uncles and nephews in distant relationships and then later enemies
 upanyaas main romance ko shuruyaat main hi kaaphi behtareen tarise se chitrit kiya gaya he
 Actually, there is a bear Baba in Madaripur, who is a Baba to say, but the elder is a Rasiya
 rasiyaa prasang main bhaaluu baba shivalay ke puujaari hote hai
 These babas are less balderies and the chiefs of balderies are more
 wo aise rasik mizaaj ke hote hai ki paas ke talab main snaan karti mahilaon ko nity dekhnaa unki dincharya kaa zaruri hissaa hota he
 But one day, due to this, they get beaten up that no one even knows where the bear Baba went from the village
 ek or anya prasang main lekhak ne us daur ke parivesh ko chitrit karne kii koshish kii he, jab nasbandi ko lekar kai tarah kii samaaj main afvaahen uda karti thim
 Nowadays the way the culture of rumor is developing in the era of social media, its hallmark can be clearly seen in Madaripur Junction
 darasal, ek din media vaale gaanv main aate hai, phir gaanv main aisi hawa uthati he ki nasbandi karne aae hai or sarkaar jabaran sabakaa nasambadi kar rahi he
 It has so many interesting and relevant episodes one after the other that the reader is not in a position to take the book away from him for a moment and holds it to the end
 upanyaas main baar-baar aapako chavanni or athnni pattee se saamana karnaa pad saktaa he, isliye kanfooj mat hoiyegaa
 While Chedi Babu dominates in Chavanni belt, Bairagi Babu dominates in Athanni belt
 darasal, upanyaas main ye donon pattee hi gaanv kii dhuri hai
 The election rhetoric of Pradhani post in the village is the central development of the novel and its two main characters are Chedi Babu and Bairagi Babu
 sach kahuun to madaripur jankshan pathak ko ant-ant tak baandhe rakhti he
 There is not a single incident in which the reader feels that the writer has forcibly inserted
 madaripur jankshan bhartiya gramin samaaj kii mul avadharana ko darshaati he, jo shaayad ab bhi gaanvon main thodi-bahut basati he
 Therefore, the reader will surely realize this while reading this

 in paanch saalon main kaaphi kuch badal gaya
 What changed the most is the system of asking questions
 is vyavastha kii buniyaad jane anjaane main 1975 main 'diwaar' film main saleem javed ne daali thi
 When Amitabh tells his lieutenant brother Shashi Kapoor that first go get the sign of the man
 meri raay main yahi line ab line main badal gai he ki jaao pehle yah puch kar aao ki 70 saalon main kyon nahin hua
 This dialogue ends on that after that my brother will sign the paper you will say
 lekin daaroga bhai ne saaf saaf kah diya ki dusron ke jurm sabit karne se yah sachai nahin badal sakati he ki tum bhi ek mujrim he
 This truth is a wall between you and me brother
 acchhee baat he ki abhi tak kisi ne nahin kaha ki smartphone 70 saal pehle kyon nahin aayaa
 Any way
 har daur kii kuch pahchaan hoti he
 Our Prime Minister Modi has added another piece to this
 gujarati main unke bhaashan ke is ansh kaa pehle anuwaad padhie
 
 
 In our country, it has become a culture that the government should do all the work
 agar aapse koi kaam nahin ho rahaa he to aap sarkaar se sawaal karen
 There was no such culture in our country
 kabhi nahin thi
 People built dharamshalas, made cow houses, and made water parbas
 kuan banaate the
 The government never did all this work
 saamaajik logon ne inkaa nirmaan kiya
 Dharamshala, water parab, library were built by everyone
 dhire-dhire jane-anjaane main logon kii takat dabaa di gai or rajya sarkaron kii takat badhati gai
 i am saying that the state government should fulfill the responsibilities of democracy and the community should work for the welfare of the society
 isse samaaj viksit hota he
 In the context of community efforts, the Prime Minister is right, but to say in a general way that you are not doing any work, then you should question the government
 sarkaar kaa kaam dharmashala bananaa nahi he or kisi samudaay ko dharmashala ke liye nahin karnaa chahie
 But Haj houses were also built and Dharamshalas
 sarkaron ne tirthayatraaen karaane kii yojana bhi bana di or sab chup rahe
 But to say that no work is being done to you, then you question the government, it creates some problem
 or sawaal karne kii samskruti hamaare desh main kab nahin thi
 The Prime Minister mentioned the library in many instances, so of course the library society has also built it, but why did the governments leave
 librari bananaa sarkaar kaa bhi kaam he
 Millions of students came from every state in Delhi, but no one can tell how many libraries the central and state governments have built
 aap dilli ke un ilaakon main jaaiye jahaan chaatr kiraaye ke makaanon main rahete hai
 The private library has opened
 chaatro ke paas padhane kii jagah nahin he
 You get a place to read in the library by paying 1000 rupees rent
 mukherjee nagar jane par chaatr chaatraon kii aam shikaayat hoti he ki padhane kii jagah nahin he
 It costs a lot of money
 puri dilli main is tarah kii librari khul gai he
 Not only in Delhi, even in Jaipur and Patna, the library has grown as a business, but the name of the public library is missing from the schemes of the state and central governments
 bahut se chaatr jo college ke nahin hai unhen librari kii zarurat hoti he
 Recently you will remember that a boy from Nazafgarh in Delhi has written that there is no library in Nazafgarh
 vahaan ke chaatro ko 35 se 45 kilometre kii duuri tay kerani hoti he
 He contacted BJP MP and AAP MLA but no one got a library
 jagah nahin mil pai
 It is the government's job to build a library in a city like Delhi
 yah sawaal bhi sarkaar se poocha janaa chahie magar chaatro ko itani buniyadi baat kaa pataa nahin he ki ve ise mudda bana saken
 Hundreds of libraries have been built in this city, but the new culture was not there to ask the question of how many governments built in the capital of the two governments, so now it has to be created
 nazangarh ke abhishek ne bataaya ki vah ek taraf se 16 kimi kii yatra kar librari jaataa he
 Together, the two sides travel 32 km to the library
 rojgaar kaa sawaal uth rahaa he
 In an interview, Prime Minister Modi called frying pakoda as a job
 tripura ke mukhyamantri biplab kumaar deb ne kaha tha ki berojgaar yuvaaon ko chahie ki ve sarkari naukari kii aas chhod kar paan dukaan khol len, gaay paalna shuru kar den
 There was a lot of criticism
 ab madhya pradesh main kamalnath kii sarkaar bani he
 What is the new idea about employment with the Congress government? sthaneey akhabaaro main ek khabar chhapi he ki mukhya mantri kamalnath kii sarkaar ne yuva swabhimaan yojana ke tahat yuvaaon ko band baaja bajaane kaa kaushal dene ja rahi he
 a school will be opened in Chhindwara for band playing training
 bagaiyr kisi skool ke itane achche band master hai apane desh main
 The government's advisors of these governments tell those who are coming out of school from the college that they are not worthy
 kahin achche band mastaron ko in schoolo main daalkar kharaab karne kii to yojana nahin he ye
 We do not know how to become a band master, but in every wedding today, i know that the tune of the wedding of my memory plays
 unhen skool kyon chahie
 Is there really no concrete answer to our politics about employment? rojgaar kis tarah kaa ho, yah ek sawaal to he magar rojgaar kii sarkari pariksha kisi ho, is par koi bhi sarkaar thos pahal nahin kar rahi he
 Students from UP to Assam are now troubled
 assam ke chaatro ne email kiya he ki rajya sarkaar ke panchayat vibhaag ne 20 may 2018 ko 945 vekency nikaali he
 The result was out on 5 March 2019
 is bich siaidi jaanch hui, jaanch main dhaandhlee kii baat saamne ai
 Students and Leader of the Opposition Tarun Gogoi alleged that people associated with the BJP and the Sangh have been selected
 ab mukhyamantri ne ek vyakti kii jaanch cameti bana di he
 But one thing happened in Ahmedabad
 3 march ko pariksha hui, shivaratri kii chuttee thi 4 march ko or riselt 5 march ko aa gaya
 i did not see these miracles during the one and a half year job series
 sandesh akhbaar kii yah khabar he
 17,900 students were sitting in this examination of Technical Supervisor and Inspector
 do din main pariksha hokar riselt ho jaae isaki charchaa har jagah honi chahie
 The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation did not care about the rules in taking the examination and obtaining the result
 AMC ne ravivaar ko pariksha lekar prashn patr bhi rakh liye, parikshaarthiyon ko ansar kii bhi nahin diya
 No one even got the news, the result came in two days
 is khabar main yah bhi he ki chaatro ne aarope lagaae hai ki pariksha ke pehle hi niyukti ke liye bulaava patr de diya gaya tha
 Results did not come out according to reserved categories
 rigelt nikaalane se pehle dastavezon kii jaanch ke liye bulaava aa gaya
 If we look at these problems, there will be no wave in the country
 dilli main atithi shikshakon kaa andolan chal rahaa he
 There is a conflict of two streams in it
 ek dhara kahati he ki bagaiyr imtahaan ke kisi ko naukari nahin milani chahie, ek dhara kahati he ki jo kai saalon se padhaa rahe hai use milani chahie
 There are different streams of BJP and Aam Aadmi Party in front of two streams of teachers, they are different
 dilli se abhishek yadav kii tarah upi ke sonbhadra se mohammad nazim ne ek video shoot kiya he
 The story is of Triveni Express
 hamane is train kaa data khud bhi check kiya he
 If we have not missed that in 365 days, this train has reached 32 times on time
 11 baar radd hui he or 322 baar let rahi he
 It lasts an average of five and a half hours
 shukriya nazim kaa jinhone is train ke vijual hamen uplabdh karaae
 14369 This train from Tanakpur to Singrauli via Sonbhadra rarely runs on its time
 bareli se aage he tanakpur
 From there it comes right up to Lucknow, but whatever happens next to it, it only happens slowly
 yatriyon kaa daawa he ki 2016 se march 2019 tak yah kabhi bhi apane samay par nahin pahunchi he
 Theft is the most common
 shikaayat darj karaane ke liye stesan master shikaayat pustika nahin dete hai
 The condition of express is worse than passenger
 triveni express ko lekar yatriyon ne rail mantri ko khub twit kiye hai
 In which the Railway Minister has been challenged to show the Triveni Express by running on time
 varanaa triveni express ko hi band kar den, isse samay kii bahut barabaadi hoti he
 This train always arrives late by 5 hours in coming from Singrauli to Lucknow
 public life kii koi keemat nahin he
 The biggest thing is that on tweeting in English, the Railway Minister has done nothing for Triveni Express
 agar ham in sawaalon ko sarkaron ke pradarshan ke saamne rakh den, kisi kii bhi sarkaar ho to sarkaron ko lagegaa ki bekaar hi hazaron karod vigyaapan par phoonk die
 Public spoiled the fun by raising the question of Triveni Express
 ham aksar sochate hai ki ye sab khabaren nahin hai badi khabar to kuch or he
 Election Commission press conference
 bilkul he magar usee din usee vakt ye log maare maare news channelon ko khoj rahe hote hai unki zindagi daanv par lagi he

 The teachers should have got a government job with this certificate but many people did not
 7 saal guzar gaye or ab 31 march ko inke certificate kii miyaad samaapt ho jaaegi
 Till now, many of these people were involved in Hindu Muslim debate, they did not understand the importance of the question of others
 jab khud kii zindagi daanv par lagi he to ab ye patrkaar khoj rahe hai
 Many of these questions may also be abusing journalists, but they understand the importance of free and public speaking media
 in sabaki pareshaani jaanaleva he
 On March 31, their eligibility for STET Eligibility Test STET will end

 Been sitting with the certificate of becoming a teacher for 7 years but did not get a job
 vekency nahin ai
 They say that 5700 schools are running without teachers in Bihar and their eligibility to become a teacher is ending
 hamen sainkadon kii sankhya main bheje gaye in messej ko dilit karte hue dukh ho rahaa he
 Where are the big anchors analyzing the election and i am doing a program about the job of Tate and the municipality
 magar in messejon main jo dard he, jo vyathaa he wo kisi ek kii nahin he
 There is a story of the entire system becoming apathetic and ruthless
 kiske paas nahin gaye ye log
 From MLA to Minister
 ye chaahate hai ki inke certificate ke khatm hone kii miyaad badha di jaae taaki ye kuch saal or naukari milane ke intazaar main khud ko ganvaa saken
 Unless the people who send the message will not be Serious about their question, the answer will not be found
 aara, patna, gopalganj or bhagalpur se mujhe messej bhej kar india pakistan kaa match dekhne se samaadhaan nahin hota he
 Going through all these messages, it seems that the citizens have ended their civic sense
 kitna bhayanak akelaapan he
 He himself will never see news related to STET eligibility for secondary teacher in prime time but wants me to show it
 chunaavon kaa elaan ho chukaa he
 Now do not send me such messages koi phayda nahin
 Officers and ministers are now engaged in election work
 aapaki samasya inke liye pehle bhi mahatvapurn nahin thi or ab to jaays bahaanaa mil gaya he
 There will be no election on the question of unemployment
 hota to abhi tak saare netaa isi ko lekar baat kar rahe hote
 There would have been debates in the channels
 main jaanata hum ki aap tanaav main hai
 Someone's certificate laps and i can understand the stress of not getting a job
 magar aap berojgaaron ko ek tabeez dena chahta hum
 Whenever there is disappointment that job is not found, set up a news channel in your home
 uske saamne saavdhaan muda main chah second khadey rahe

 aap apana dard bhul jaaenge
 And by doing so, the morale of the army will not fall
 vaise aapke netaa rojgaar par baat kyon nahin kar rahe hai
 Don't you want aaj hi indian express main khabar ai he ki kheti se jude kaamon kii mazaduri kaaphi gir gai he
 The income of those who are cultivated is the lowest in 14 years
 phir bhi media main kisaan nahin he
 Do not make politics a spectacle
 chunaav kaa samay he, is dauraan gambhir rahen
 This report of Dheeraj Mishra on The Wire will be very useful in the welfare of Ganga
 di vir ne artiai se poocha he ki aktubar 2016 main neshnal ganga council bani thi, uski ab tak kitni baithke hui hai
 The Prime Minister is the chairman of the National Ganga Council
 niyam ke anusaar isaki saal main ek baar baithak honi chahie
 But it has been reported from RTI that not a single meeting of the National Ganga Council has been held
 jabaki iske bane hue do saal ho gaye
 Its task was to manage, conserve the water of the river Ganges
 ganga ko lekar chal rahi pariyojnaon kii samiksha ke liye yah sheersh sanstha hai magar do saal main ek bhi baithak nahin ho saki
 Apart from our culture, Ganga is an important part of politics after 2014 and not a single meeting of its top institution takes place

 a Pakistani anti-terrorism court sent two top police officers to judicial custody for a fortnight for their alleged acts of providing security to former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
 isbich, rawalpindi police ke purv pramukh saud ajij ke vakil ne daawa kiya he ki unhone benazir kii us chunavi sabha ke liye paryaapt bandobast kiya tha, jis din ek aatmghaatee hamale main unki maut ho gai thi

 But by the time Anori reached the close of the sentry ward, the matter had already got out of hand
 ward ke andar band ekkaidideepak singh farsh par lahooluhaan padaa hua tha
 The movement in his body had almost stopped
 jabaki usee ward main uske saath band chaar or kaidi maukey par hi range haath khadey the
 Deepak, who fell alone in the ward, had a fatal attack 0 and how dreadful this attack was, it can be gauged from the fact that his four companions had not only burst his eyes, but some sharp things from his face
 But almost the entire body was riddled
 ab jail prashasan ne aanan-fanan main deepak ko uthaa kar deen dayaal upaadhyaay aspataal bhijwaya, lekin tab tak der ho chuki thi
 The doctors declared Deepak dead
 deepak lut, dakaiti or apharan jaise gunahon ke 14 maamalon main pichley saat saalon se isi jail main band tha
 His Gitni was among the dreaded inmates of the jail, he was kept in ward number 5
 deepak ke katl ke iljaam main jinkidiyonke haath khun se range hai, unka becoground bhi koi kam khatarnaak nahin he
 These prisoners are Satpal Bedi, Manpreet, Suraj and Riyaz
 sutron kii maane to ek dablemurdersmet aise hi sangeen gunahon ke iljaam main jail main band satpal naa sirf is ward main band baaki ke gangstaron kaa sargana he, balki vah jail se vasuuli kaa dhandha bhi chalaata he
 It is because of his domineering personality that Satpal also determines the accountability of the work of the other prisoners in the jail
 yani koun saqaidikya kaam karegaa or koun aaraam karegaa, apane ward main yah sab satpal hi tay kiya karata tha
 Now Deepak started challenging his personality even while staying with Satpal and his gang
 sutron kii maane to mote taur par deepak ke katl ke peeche bhi yahi vajah rahi
 If the Tihar administration had been vigilant and looked at the prisoners, this would not have happened
 yahaan to jo kaidi ek-duusare ke dushman the unhen naa sirf saath rakhaa gaya balki vahi kaidi maheenon se plate, chammach or pipe jaisi chizon ko ghis-ghis kar aslha banaate rahe or santari kaan main tel daal kar sote rahe
 In such a situation, the question is why till now the administration has ignored all these things? ames test for management (ATMA) pariksha ravivaar yani 14 disambar ko hone ja rahi he
 This exam will be online
 is exam kaa rigelt 20 disambar ko aane kii sambhaavna he

 al kaayda ke aatankwaadi network dwaara aise mahila fidaayin taiyaar karne kii khabaron ke bich, jinke breast main surgery ke dwaara bam feet hoga, puri duniya ke bade airport hai alert par hai
 Recently, security was tightened at London's Heathrow Airport after fears of an attack from such a breast bomb
 ab khabar ai he ki bhartiya airport bhi breast bam ke hamale ke shikaar ho sakate hai
 The danger is that there are no such machines at the airport of India, which can scan the entire body to find whether there is any explosive or metal inside the body
 philhal suraksha agenciyaan aihtiyathan minial jaanch ke bharose hai
 Indian security agencies have alerted airport agencies after the possibility of a breast bomb
 airport par tainaat suraksha karmiyon ko nirdesh die gaye hai ki mahila yatriyon kii dohari jaanch kii jaae
 The reason for this instruction is the absence of a full body scanner at any airport in India
 ye scinar breast implant surgery yaa kisi or medical tareeke se sharir ke andar feet kiye bam ko detect kar sakate hai
 Instruct the employees, take care of the dignity
 After this instruction, the officers are also feeling that the passengers should not be disturbed by such intensive investigation
 mahila karmchaariyon ko nirdesh diya gaya he ki achche se jaanch kii jaae, magar yatri kii garima kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa jaae
 According to a report published in an English newspaper, officials associated with airport security said that the new threat has been explained to the women employees involved in the security investigation
 breast implant main agar koi metal material istemaal nahin kiya gaya he, to use detect karnaa mushkil hota he
 In such a situation, there is only the support of manual investigation
 iske alaava suraksha agenciyaan videshi agenciyon se is khatre ke har mumkin byore kii jaankaree bhi juta rahi hai
 How can such bombs work, how can they be stopped, and other alternative ways to detect other than scanners
 is silsile main pichley hafte airport ke function se jude sabhi vibhaagon kii ek hai level meeting bhi hui thi
 How the Brest Bomb came to be known Last week a newspaper, The Mirror, reported that Al Qaeda's chief bomb maker Ibrahim al-assiri had succeeded in making a bomb in which explosive material was surgically injected into the women's breast
 Can be hidden inside iske liye breast implant main istemaal hone vaale material kii aad lee jaati he
 Airport scanners cannot catch such bombs

 ) kabhi-kabhi kahaniyon main bhi aise kisse nahin milte, thik vaise hi jaise pichley kareeb 12 dinon se akele puri dilli police kii kirakiri karne vaale gopal kanda kii daastaan
 a person who earns a few hundred rupees a month by doing bad radio repair, when he starts selling shoes and then after selling shoes, takes the feet of the leaders and puts his feet in the plane, it is not known
 nazaren aasmaan main thim or nigahen hawaii jahaaz par
 It was the early nineties
 haryana ke chote se shahar sirsa main tab gopal goyal kanda kii radio repere kii ek choti si dukaan thi
 Jupiter Music Home
 is dukaan se maheene main bamushkil kuch sau yaa hajaar rupye kii hi aamadani hoti thi
 But by now Kanda's eyes had fallen on the plane in the sky
 lekin radio repere karne kii ek maamuli si dukaan se wo aasmaan tak kaa safai tay nahin kar saktaa tha
 So, without delay, Kanda locked up his Jupiter music home and started a new business in association with his brother Govind Kanda
 is baar kanda ne juute or chappal kii dukaan kholi, kanda shu camp
 The shop went on and then the two brothers started a shoe-making factory, increasing their business
 ab donon khud juuta banaate or apni dukaan main bechate
 While selling shoes, Gopal Kanda had measured the feet of many and many of them were businessmen, builders, brokers and politicians
 raajnneetik talvon ko naapane kii shuruuaat kanda ne bansilaal ke bete se kii
 When Bansi Lal came close to his son, suddenly a rage started growing
 magar phir jaise hi bansilaal kii sarkaar gai to kanda ne bina der kiye omprakash chautaala ke beton ke paanv naapane shuru kar die
 When political hands reached the head, the weight of the shoes also increased
 magar ab bhi bijness lender or sarkaar ke bich jhulate hue hi karnaa pad rahaa tha
 So Kanda changed the maneuver again
 wo ab raajnneeti ko kaarobaar bananaa chahta tha jabaki uskaa bhai govind kaarobaar se raajnneeti kii jugat main tha
 It is said that during this time, an IAS officer came to Sirsa and by filling the same officer's bag, Kanda started expanding his scope of business
 phir tabhi un afasar sahab kaa transfar gudgaanv ho gaya
 The decision to change the face of Gurgaon had already been made
 is faisle ke saath hi gudgaanv kii zamin sona ho gai thi or zamin waalon kii chaandi
 Haryana Urban Development Authority ie HUDA had become the biggest landowner of Gurgaon and IAS officer close to Kanda had become a very big officer of HUDA
 kanda kii kismat kaa daravaaza ab puri tarah se khulne ja rahaa tha
 So he picked up his scooter from Sirsa and went straight to Gurgaon
 ab dallali uskaa pesha ban chukaa tha
 The ground was spewing gold and he was swallowing gold
 dhire-dhire vakt beetaa or phir saal 2007 main achaanak ai ek khabar ne puure sirsa ko chaunkaa diya
 Gopal Kanda started an airline company named MDLR in the name of his lawyer father Muralidhar Lakhram
 par emdlaar airlans ke bahi-khate main sahi-galat ke hisaab itane kharaab the ki kanda ke hawaii sapane hawa ho gaye
 After barely two years, the plane was on the ground and Kanda himself was in search of new land
 zamin par aane ke baad kanda ne hotel, casino, praparty dling, skool, kalege or yahaan tak ki local news channel main bhi haath aazamaaya or khub kamaaya
 But in the midst of all this, he always kept his eyes on the politics of Sirsa
 vot me note invest karte-karte aakhirkaar 2009 ke vidhasabha chunaav main nirdaleey ummidavaar ke taur par hi maudaan main kud padaa or chunaav jeet bhi gaya
 See luck, Congress got 40 seats in the 90-member assembly
 nirdaleey vidhayakon ne apni-apni boli lagaai or usee boli main gopal kanda ne apni keemat vasuuli or haryana kaa griharajya mantri ban baitha
 Now Kanda was used to press the police salute khud kabhi netaaon or unke beton ke gurgey rahe kanda ke gurgey bhi ab sher the
 In September 2010, Kanda was gang-raped in his car
 haalanki gurgey andar hue par mantri ji par koi aanch nahin ai
 In July 2011, the car of cricketer Atul Vasan tried to overtake his convoy, and Vasan was killed
 mantri ji par tab bhi koi aanch nahin ai
 Kanda had become the biggest lion of Sirsa since becoming a minister
 sirsa ke shu camp kaa naam badal kar ab usne camp offis kar diya
 MDLR service had stopped but the company was running and around 40 other companies were running with it
 paisa or power aayaa to saath main bahut si gandagi bhi laayaa
 Kanda started hiring girls in most of his companies
 choti umr main hi ladakiyon ko bade-bade pad baant die or inhen main se ek ladki thi dilli kii geetika
 In 2006, Howai was interviewed in Gurgaon to recruit airhostess and cabin crew at the company
 usee intervyuu main kanda pehali baar geetika se mila or intervyuu khatm hote hi use train cabin kru kaa letters thama diya
 Then six months later, as soon as Geetika turned 18, she was made an airhostess
 iske baad to geetika kii tarakkee or vakt ke bich jaise res lag gai
 The faster Geetika climbed up the ladder to progress, and within three years Faqat rose from the trainee in the company to the director's chair
 ye sab meharbaani thi kanda kii
 The showers continued to rain and Geetika continued to progress
 par phir achaanak kuch aisa hua ki geetika, kanda or uski company donon se dur chali gai
 He got a job in Dubai
 par kanda ne use dilli waapas aane par majaboor kar diya
 Even after coming to Delhi, Kanda did not stop chasing Geetika and due to this she suffocated herself so much that she strangled her
 par marane se pehle do pannon main geetika wo sach likh gai jisane pehali baar kanda ko zamin naapane par majaboor kar diya
 He had already landed by plane
 par use apane juute ko aazamaane kaa mauka geetika ke suicide note ne hi diya
 After 12 days of running away from the police, Kanda's legs and shoes finally got tired
 or shaayad isi ke saath ab uski raftaar bhi tham jaae
 The person to whom the Delhi Police had opened its horses for 12 days, whose big claims were being made about the arrest, was not caught by the police even when that Alania herself was on her feet Had reached the threshold of the police station
 sach yahi he ki kanda ne bhaagane se lekar sarender karne tak sab kuch thik vaise hi kiya jaisaa usne sochaa tha
 We will arrest Kanda very soon, our best boys are working on it
 ye massej kamishnar sahab ne 17 agast kii raat kareeb saadhe das baje us vakt twit kiya jab ye khabar ai ki kanda aaj raat kabhi bhi sarender kar saktaa he
 Everyone knew that if Kanda surrenders in the dark of night, where will he do it? Apparently the court did not open at night and the case was with the north-west District Police, whose DCP office is in Ashok Vihar police station
 lihaaza khabar brake karte hi tamaam krim reporter jitani jaldi pahunch sakate the ashok vihaar thane pahunch gaye
 In view of the increasing number of reports and news channel's OB every minute, now the number of policemen also started growing outside the police station
 aalaa police afasaron ke reporters ke paas phone aane lage ki kya sach main kanda sarender karne aa rahaa he
 For the first time after eleven o'clock, the police felt that there was no merit in the news, after the report remained firm on its news
 lihaaza so chuke yaa sone ja rahe police afasaron ko hadabada kar uthaaya gaya or unhen police ke baari jamaavade ke saath ashok vihaar thane ke baahar tainaat kar diya gaya taaki kam se kam kanda aae to use pakadaney ke liye police vaale to maujuud hon
 With the passage of time, things were also changing rapidly
 thane ke baahar kaa manzar maida-e-jang kii tasviir pesh kar rahaa tha
 It was just strange that instead of moving towards the enemy, the police was waiting for his arrival in his place, contrary to the commissioner's tweet
 iske baad raat 12 baj kar das minute par nayaa tamaasha shuru hota he
 Before Kanda arrives, his supporters threaten outside the Ashok Vihar police station
 kanda ke naam ke naare lagaate hai or uske swaagat ke liye vahiin dat jate hai
 The brother of the same Kanda leads this entire scene
 tamaam pulisavaalon ke saamne thane ke baahar khadey hokar kanda kaa bhai kanda ke yahaan pahunchane or sarender karne kaa aise elaan karata he jaise chunavi raily main amuman kisi bade netaa yaa badi hasti ke pahunchane kaa elaan hota he
 However, by now the police had probably understood everything
 isiilie north-west district ke tamaam border sil kar die gaye
 Every road coming towards Ashok Vihar was guarded
 jagah-jah bairicads laga die gaye, laga ki chalo vaise nahin to aise hi sahi
 The commissioner's tweet will prove to be true and his best boys will catch him before surrendering to Kanda
 par vaaki kamaal he kanda kaa
 As long as the mind remained hidden and when it was bored to hide, then proclaiming it of its own will, challenging the police and reached the threshold of Ashok Vihar police station
 par phir bhi police use pakad nahin pai
 Kanda came to the police station in his news channel's car to dodge the police at around four in the morning and surrendered the way he wanted
 kamishnar sahab ke best bwys aakhir tak use pakad nahin paae
 Well there is one more question here
 kya kanda ne sarender kii khabar jaan-boojh kar media main li kii? taaki khabar sunate hi media uski bataai hui jagah par pahunchen auki wo usee bheed kaa phayda uthaa kar apane news channel kii gaadi main vahaan tak pahunch jaae? agar aisa he to ye bhi sabak he dilli police ke liye
 Because the Delhi Police could not find a way to catch him, yes, Kanda did find a way to reach the police
 kehete hai ki kanda ko kareeb se jaanane waalon ne hameshaa use bas ek hi khatre se aagaah kiya, or wo khatra tha ladakiyon ke saath uski nazdikiyon kaa
 Kanda always kept girls at the forefront of their companies
 media ko mili kuch tasveeron main ek kisi satsang kii hai jahaan stage par gopal kanda naach rahaa he, vahiin geetika uske saath satsang main shariq hui he
 These pictures clearly show the proximity of Geetika and Gopal
 darasal ise gopal kanda kii kamajori kahen yaa shauk lekin sach to ye he ki gopal kii dilchaspee ladakiyon main kuch zyada hi thi
 Aruna Chadha, Nupur Mehta, Ankita and Geetika Sharma, these are the few names that Gopal Kanda has held high in his company
 kam umr main badi selary or package die
 Kanda, who runs a school university and a business empire of crores, was very kind to the girls
 gopal kanda ne ek do nahin balki kul 48 company bana rakhi thim
 a large number of girls were employed in these companies, including posts like company director, deputy director and company secretary
 gopal kanda kii in adtis companiyon main kai main to khud gopal kanda nideshak he
 Geetika Sharma was given the post of deputy director in Kanda's company a k g Infrabuild while Aruna Chadha was the company's director
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki i ke ji infrobild ko geetika ne 3 march 2012 main yani apni maut ke kuch maheene pehle hi jwine kiya tha
 Apart from these companies, Kanda has also formed several trusts like MDLR International School Sirsa
 is skool main bhi geetika sharma trustee ke taur par registerd thi
 How much Aruna Chadha and Geetika hated each other in Kanda's company is mentioned in Geetika's suicide note
 aruna or kanda ab donon hi police kii giraft main hai or police geetika kii khudakushi kii vajah jaanane ke saath hi kanda ke karodon ke samrajya kaa har sach ugalvaane kii koshish karegi
 The BJP is not ready to come back on the backfoot even if it screws up to form a government with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 sabhi nirdaleey vidhayakon ko apane saath khadaa kar bhaajapa shivasena par dabaav banane main juty he
 After Aditya Thackeray won the election for the first time as a member of the Thackeray house, the BJP has made it clear that the post will not be given to the Shiv Sena
 bhaajapa kaa kahana he ki use 15 nirdaleeyon kaa bhi samarthan mila he
 Some other mlas of smaller parties are also in touch
 is prakaar vah 2014 kii tarah hi sankhyabal ke aadhaar par majboot sthiti main he
 Overall, the BJP is trying to give a message to the Shiv Sena that it has not weakened in any way in this election
 bhaajapa kii maharashtra ikai kii pravaktaa shweta shalini ne somvaar ko 'ieenes' se kaha, "bhaajapa ke saath 15 nirdaleey vidhayak khadey hai
 These independents have been the leaders of the BJP, who won by fighting unarmed due to lack of tickets due to coalition etc
 2014 kii tarah hi party ke paas ab bhi 122 vidhayakon kaa samarthan he
 "let me tell you that Geeta Jain, who won after fighting unarmed by BJP ticket from Meera Bhayander seat, Rajendra Raut from Barsi seat, Ravi Rana who won from Badnera seat in Amravati district, have announced their support to the BJP
 bhaajapa kaa kahana he ki in teenon kii tarah anya nirdal vidhayakon ne khud bhaajapa se sampark kar samarthan dene kii baat kahi he, kyonki unka naata bhaajapa se hi rahaa he
 On October 24, the day of the results, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis also spoke about getting in touch with 15 independents
 shivasena ke mukhyamantri pad ko lekar ad jane ke sawaal par bhaajapa pravaktaa shweta shalini ne kaha, "mukhyamantri bhaajapa kaa tha, he or aage bhi rahegaa
 bjp's stance on the post of Chief Minister is clear
 shivasena bhi ise jaanati he
 "actually, the screw of forming the government got stuck even after the NDA got a majority when Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray raised the 50-50 formula decided during the Lok Sabha elections on 24 October, the day of the election results
 
 unhone sanket die ki shivasena dhai saal ke liye mukhyamantri pad chaahati he
 Who will be the CM? On this question in the press conference, he said, "this is a very important question
 "chunaav se purv shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana main chape uddhav thakare ne apane intervyuu main bhi kaha tha ki vah shivasainik ko mukhyamantri banate dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Since then, the screw has been stuck in the bjp-shiv Sena to form the government
 somvaar ko donon dalon ke netaaon ne rajyapal se alag-alag bhent bhi kii
 It is believed that the talks regarding the posts in the Chief Minister and the government have not been resolved
 bhaajapa pravaktaa shweta shalini ne kaha, "loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan jis 50-50 formule kii baat shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare kah rahe hai, usamen bahut-si baaten ho saktin hai
 There may also be talk of contesting 50-50 percent seats during elections
 iskaa matlab dhai-dhai saal mukhyamantri kii kursi par baithne se nahin lagaaya ja saktaa

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 73wein swatantraaa diwas par guuruuvaar ko laal kile kii pracheer se bhaashan diya
 India gained independence on 15 August 1947 from the British rule
 pakistan apana swatantraaa diwas ek din pehle yani 14 agast ko manaata he
 While Prime Minister Modi gave a speech on Independence Day from Red Fort, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan gave his speech on Wednesday in the Assembly of Pak Occupied Kashmir (pok) in Muzaffarabad
 imran khan ke bhaashan kaa adhiktar hissaa bharat or piem modi par nishaanaa saadhane main rahaa
 In his speech, Imran also mentioned Kashmir many times
 vahiin piem modi ne apane 92 minute ke bhaashan main ek baar bhi pakistan yaa imran khan ke naam kaa zikr nahin kiya
 PM Modi congratulated Afghanistan which is going to celebrate its 100th Independence Day on 19 August
 india today ke data intelegence unit (DIU) ne donon pradhanmantriyon ke bhaashan main bole gaye shabdon kaa tulanaatmak vishleshan kiya
 What did Imran Khan say in the speech? Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan's Independence Day speech had 'kashmir' in it
 saath hi bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ko lekar imran kii ghabrahat-bechaini bhi unke bhaashan main khub dikhi
 The word that came up repeatedly in Imran's speech was 'ideology' (ideology)
 imran ne is shabd kaa 23 baar apane bhaashan main istemaal kiya
 On the second number, Imran mentioned 'kashmir' 20 times
 imran ne 'log' shabd kaa 14 baar ullekh kiya
 However a strange thing also appeared here
 pakistan ke logon kii jagah imran ne apane bhaashan main 'kashmir' ke logon kaa 17-18 baar zikr kiya
 Imran used the word 'pakistan' 12 times, which was much less than the word 'kashmir' spoken in the speech
 aisa piem modi ke bhaashan main nahin dikhaa, unhone kisi bhi bhugaulik kshetra kii tulana main bharat kaa adhik baar naam liya
 Imran has targeted PM Modi, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) along with taking the name of 'kashmir' many times
 imran ne modi or aresas kii vichaardhaara kii tulana hitler kii naaji sarkaar ke saath kii
 Imran took the name of 'bharat' 11 times in his speech
 isse ek baar hi zyada yani 12 baar unhone 'pakistan' kaa naam liya
 In Imran's speech, 'RSS' appeared 7 times, 'modi' 7 times and 'nazi' 6 times
 imran ne buudhvaar ko is partvitbhi kiya
 Imran also referred to the article 'hitler's Hindus: The Rise and Rise of India's Nazi-loving Nationalists' by Shrenik Rao, editor-in-chief of the Madras Courier, comparing RSS ideology and Nazi ideology
 This is the RSS ideology that threatens not just Kashmiris or Pakistan or even just Indian Muslims, Christians & Dalits but India itself as envisaged by its Founding Fathers

 co / xn1ctcbrwjâ Imran Khan (@imrankhanpti)august 14, 2019modi ke bhaashan main kya-kya tha?piem modi ke guuruuvaar ko die swatantraaa diwas bhaashan main naagarik shabd sabase zyada 47 baar aayaa
 This is followed by 'freedom' (30), 'water' (24), 'poor' (17), 'terrorism' (16), peasants (15) 'article 370' (14) and 'tourism' (13) and the army
 (10) came to be mentioned
 jin shabdon kaa modi ke bhaashan main sabase adhik baar zikr hua wo unase jude modi ke drushtikon kii bhi jhalak dikhalaataa he
 As Modi mentioned the mission of providing water to all, 'jal Jeevan', he used the word 'water' many times in his speech
 is mishan par 3
 5 lakh crore rupees will be spent
 isi tarah garibi rekha se neeche rahane vaale logon ke liye kalyaan yojanaon kii baat kehete hue unhone 'garib' shabd kaa bhaashan main 17 baar istemaal kiya
 The removal of Articles 370 and 35A was also mentioned in Modi's speech
 piem modi ne bhartiya nagarikon se kam se kam 15 paryaton sthalon par 2022 tak jane kaa aagrah kiya
 That is why the word 'tourism' also came up several times in his speech
 piem modi ne bhaashan main ullekh kiya ki aatankwaad se naa sirf bharat balki iske padosiyon ko bhi bhugatna bhi padaa he
 However, he avoided naming Pakistan in his speech
 unhone imran khan ko lekar bhi kuch nahin bolaa
 'kahaani 2' has nothing to do with the first 'kahaani', except that the film is directed by Sujoy Ghosh
 mukhya kirdaar main vidya baalan or arjuna rampal hai
 This movie is a suspense thriller and these three reasons are enough to generate curiosity about the film
 'kahani' kii kahanikahani haividya sinhaki jo kolkata ke paas ek chote se shahar chandanpur main apni beti ke saath khushnuma jivan bitaa rahi he

 screenplefilm kii shuruyaat behad dilachasp tareeke se shuru hoti he or interval tak story aapako baandh kar rakhane main kaamyaab hoti he
 But after the interval, the story slows down a bit
 kamjor kadilekhak sujoy ghosh or suresh nair kaa clymex thodaa sa bojhil he
 This is a suspense thriller so it would be wrong to tell more about the film but the climax of 'kahani 2' seems weak and filmy compared to the first 'kahaani'
 abhinavbhinay ke maamle main vidya baalan 'kahani 2' kii jaan hai
 She has performed every scene well and in some places she makes sure that she is not an actress but Durga Rani Singh
 arjuna rampal ne bhi behad natural kaam kiya he or vidya ko acha saport diya he
 Jugal Hansraj and all the other actors fit into his characters
 film kii majboot kadipatan basu kii cinemetography, subrata baarik kaa production dizin or becoground mujeec laajawab he
 Director Sujoy Ghosh once again succeeds in making Kolkata and Keelingpong the characters in the story

 After some time, Yamraj himself was standing with many messengers before him
 jab yamraj satyawan kii jeevatma ko lekar dakshin disha kii ore chalane lage, savitri bhi unke peeche chalane lagi
 Going forward, Yamraj said to Savitri, 'oh dear lady! As far as man can support, you have supported your husband
 ab tum laut jaao
 To this Savitri said, 'I should go as far as my husband goes
 yahi sanathan satya he
 Yamraj was pleased to hear Savitri's voice and asked her to ask for the bride- Savitri said, 'my father-in-law is blind, give him eye-light
 yamraj ne 'tathastu kahkar use laut jane ko kaha or aage badhane lage
 But Savitri kept following Yama
 yamraj ne prasann hokar pun: var maangane ko kaha
 Savitri asked the groom, 'he should get back the lost state of my father-in-law and 100 sons should be born to my father
 yamraj ne 'tathastu kahkar pun: use laut jane ko kaha, parantu savitri apni baat par atal rahi or waapas nahin gai
 Seeing Savitri's husband's devotion, Yamraj melted and asked Savitri to ask for another groom
 tippaniyan Savitri then asked, 'I want to be the mother of Satyavan's well-deserved son
 krupa kar aap mujhe yah vardaan den
 Pleased with the devotion of Savitri, while giving this final boon, Yamraj freed Satyavan's soul from the loop and disappeared
 savitri jab usee vat vriksh ke paas ai to usne paaya ki vat vriksh ke neeche pade satyawan ke mrit sharir main jeev kaa sanchaar ho rahaa he
 After some time, Satyavan got up and sat down
 udhar, satyawan ke mata-pita kii ankhen bhi thik ho gayi or unka khoyaa hua rajya bhi waapas mil gaya

 Yamraj was pleased and asked to ask for the groom again
 savitri ne var maanga, 'mere sasur kaa khoyaa hua rajya unhen waapas mil jaae tathaa mere pita ke yahaan 100 putron kaa janm ho
 Yamraj said 'aastu' and asked her to return again, but Savitri remained firm on her word and did not go back
 savitri kii pati bhakthi dekhakar yamraj pigal gaye or unhone savitri se ek or var maangane ke liye kaha
 The comments tab savitri ne var maanga, 'main satyawan ke suyogy putr kii maa bananaa chaahati hum

 Its basic principles are similar to Indian thought
 frid ke anusaar saare swapn hamaari ichha kaa hi parinaam hai
 In the Atharvaveda, the Kama Devata is called the dreamer yahaan kavita ko kaam kii putree kaha gaya he
 The first Upanishadic philosophy of Egypt also attempts to understand dreams
 frid kii aadhi baat sach he
 Most dreams are the creation of our desire
 man ek or sansar gadhata he
 We are the characters of the dream world
 swapn sansar mjedaar he
 Sometimes beautiful, forest, groves, sometimes dry trees
 anek swapn duusare din jas ke tas sahi siddh ho jate hai
 Such dreams are not mentioned in the discussion of Freud and modern psychology
 âdictionari of drimsâ main swapn main saanp dekhne kii badi vyakhya he

 Man is a part of the entire existence

 There are also at least two types of deep sleep conditions
 sanrpun nidra main keval praan gati karata he
 Our sense of perception becomes zero, mind becomes pacific
 bhartiya chintan main ek vichaar he ki man bhi praan main lay kar jaataa he
 Then there are no dreams
 ham jaagate hue bhi swapn dekhte hai
 The reason for this is mind
 nidra ke dauraan prashanth man swapnheen rahata he
 Patanjali Yoga Sutras emphasize the end of the mind
 ek vichaar he ki man batch jaataa he lekin gati nahin karata
 Whatever be the truth but dreamless sleep gives great energy
 nidra kii shuruyaat main aankh, kaan, naak aadi indriyaan shithil hoti hai, yahi man ke upkaran hai
 After relaxation of the senses, thoughts are left with the mind
 is dasha main aae swapn ichha kaa parinaam hote hai
 But with the relaxation of the mind, consciousness sometimes gets connected to cosmic consciousness

 The Pippalad of the Atharvaveda â a part of the Shakhaya Brahmin â is the Quakopanishad
 prashnopanishad anuthi he
 Here there is restlessness of questions, not faith
 katha main pippalad rishi se 6 rishiyon ne ek-ek prashn poocha
 The fourth question is fun
 gragy ne poocha, âpragadh nidra main manushya ke bheetar rahane vaali koun-koun divya shaktiyaan soti hai? koun jaagti rahati hai? swapn main koun in ghatnaon ko dekhtaa he? nidra main sukh kaa majaa kisko hota he?âpippalad ne uttar diya, ânidra ke samay sari indriyaan- divyashaktiyaan man main villin ho jaati hai, isliye jeevatma na sunata he, na soonghta he, na swaad letaa he, na sparsh karata he, na bolta he

 Eminent cosmologist Stephen Hawkings has given an in-depth discussion of time
 kaha he ki kya ham aisa tej raftaar vaahan bana sakate hai? jo apni teevr gati ke chalate vartmaan se bhi tivratam daudta hua bhavishya main pahunch saktaa he? shaayad aisa sambhav ho
 If the present and future are part of time, then the hope of leaping from the present to leap into the future is not futile
 hawkings bhautik vigyaani hai
 They think of high speed vehicles
 kya man aisa hi vaahan nahin he? jaagrit avasthaa kaa man bhi pal se bhi kam samay main america, england, france yaa akaash chandra tak pahunchaa detaa he
 This time can also be reduced
 nidra ke samay man ke saamne indriyon ke jhanjhat main funsane kii kathinaayee nahin hoti
 It is possible that this mind transcends the present in its extreme speed and reaches the future and this mind also shows the future events
 atharvaveda main bhrigu ne thik kaha he ki âman kaal ke bheetar he
 'the mind travels in all the three dimensions of time - memory goes into the past
 bhavishya main jaataa he to aakanksha
 The dream of desire is within Freud's interpretation, but in his deep sleep alone in his fun, this mind goes beyond the limits of desire, desire and shows the future, then what is the surprise? But wonder too

 input: bhashaa Just called the younger brother Attu from my hometown Makhanpur - "paresh Bhaiya, your Joshi sir is no more
 " joshi sar, yani hamaare angreji ke adhyaaapak prannath joshi, jo sirf adhyaaapak hi nahin, hamaari jindagi ke model or hero bhi the
 Me too, also of Attu and many of the young people of our small town of Makhanpur, who were carrying a dream in life
 attu kaa galaa rundha hua tha
 He didn't say much
 bas, itnaa hi ki kuch arase se biimaar the, par aisa to nahin lagata tha ki yon chale jaayenge
 "even

 So age had already passed, but age did not dominate them
 is umr main bhi jindadilii se labalab the
 Lots of gossip, lots of talk
 
 
 bahasein! sahitya ke saath-saath raajnneeti ko lekar bhi
 And here, his heated arguments about politics had increased a lot
 kehete the, desh kahan ja rahaa he, bhai, mujhe bilkul samaj main nahin aa rahaa
 But i can definitely say that there is something wrong, a huge mess, which can be dangerous for tomorrow
 netaaon se kuch nahin hona
 They cannot see anything further with their petty advantages
 haan, kuch saaf dil vaale noujvaan log aage aaen to kuch ho saktaa he
 "and yes brother!" Said Attu, "used to miss you a lot
 main jab bhi unase milane gaya, aisa ek dfa bhi nahin hua ki unhone yaad na kiya ho
 They used to say, my students are so good that they miss me wherever they are
 milane bhi chale aate hai or jarurat padane par madad ke liye bhi taiyaar rahete hai
 One of them is an intelligent student
 kuch to bahut bade padon par pahunche, par ab bhi aakar pair choote hai
 Yes, there is a Paresh who gets rainy for years, but i have never forgotten him even for a day

 The words of Attu are changing in dark darkness and endless blur and i am beating my hands and feet in that dark sea

 yah jaanate hue bhi ki ve puri umr jikar gaye hai or insaan ko aakhir kabhi to janaa hi hota he, man ab bhi sweekaar karne ko raji nahin ki joshi sar nahin rahe
 Because of who we were and what we are today

 However, it was never felt with Joshi sir
 unhone aatmavishvaas diya tha, kisi bhi badi se badi mushkil se bhid jane or jaraa bhi na ghabaraane kaa
 Whatever we used to do, he was the force behind it
 isi kaaran unke hote parvaah nahin thi kisi kii, koi bhale hi kitna hi, kaisaa hi aflatoon kyon na ho
 He taught that if your heart says something clearly, then do the same
 phir uske aage kisi kii parvaah mat karo
 Even more such amazing things that give courage even today, step by step

 That is mecca-medina! "the fact is that his disciples were his life and he was respected by Joshi sir as much as anyone else
 yon ve jaise padhaane ke saath-saath apane sareekhe logon kaa ek parivaar bana rahe the or unke ritair hote-hote vah bahut bada ho gaya
 i remember, while teaching in class, he once said, "look, you guys don't mind
 
 
 
 But i know that more than half of you children will not even wish to meet on the way
 nazren bachaakar nikal jaayenge, ki joshi sar saamne hai to kahin namaste na karnaa pad jaae! or kuch to yah bhi sochenge ki tha koi angreji kaa teacher to ab kya karen? padhaata tha hamen to kaahe kaa ahsaan! kya skool se tankhwaah nahin letaa tha?""nahin sar, nahin
 "as soon as Joshi Sir's talk was complete, the whole class screamed together," It will never happen Sir! "- Everyone's throat was broken
 "acha, nahin?" joshi sar thathakar hanse the apane majaak par
 But for the first time i read a story written in such a cryptic script on his face, in which a touching chapter of his life-story was hidden
 haalaanki vah jivan bhar hamaare liye agyaat, balki rahasy hi rahaa
 For us, the truth of his story was that Joshi sir was a life-giving teacher for his students, who had no personal dream other than this
 hamaare skool âadarsh vidyabhavanâ ke baaki adhyaaapak jahaan raat-din tution ke nashe main duube rahete the, vahaan ve apana ek-ek pal apane shishyon ko dene ke liye jaise baichaiyn the

 There were words of count on it, but they are still recorded on my heart slate
 unhone likhaa tha- âpriy paresh, chalo acha rahaa tum patrakarita main aa gaye
 If you were interested in writing and reading from the beginning, then you will like it here and you will get to do a lot of new things

 Where success is difficult, very difficult - show the way out there too
 meri shubh kamanaayen hameshaa tumhaare saath hai or rahengi
 Joshi's troubles came and now sometimes it is surprising, how Joshi sir had guessed years ago that these threats or difficulties are going to come in front of me
 asal main ve shishyon se itnaa kareebi taur se jud jate the ki unhen vah sab bhi dikhaai padataa tha, jo akasar auron ko najar nahin aata
 Many times i and Subodh, who were his disciples, got into trouble
 par unki ankhen hamen dekh rahi hai har ghadi, isse na jane kisi aashwasti-si mahasoos hoti ki ham khud ko bharaa-puraa mahasoos karte the
 i got into journalism according to my mood and Subodh, who was a practical guy with far more nuanced thinking, became an engineer
 ham do alag-alag dhruvon par the, par ek-duusare ko beintahaa pyaar karte the
 Behind it too was perhaps Joshi sir, who could build a bridge on two opposite streams as well - a solid and durable bridge
 subodh kii tulana main main kuch angadh or bedab kism kaa praani tha
