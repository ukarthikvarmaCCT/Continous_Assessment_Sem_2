 ’ The much awaited CAG report on Rafale Deal was presented in Parliament on Thursday
 is report main yun to rafel vimaanon kii kharid se judi lagbhag puri prakriya kii padtaal kii gai he
 But in the 16-page report, the biggest question remained unanswered
 isi sawaal ko lekar vipaksh hameshaa sansad se lekar sadak tak sarkaar ko gherta aayaa he
 This question is about the cost of Rafale planes
 rafel par sieji kii puri report main rafel kii asal keemat kaa zikr hi nahin he
 U1 as a code where price is concerned
 
 
 jaise verde istemaal kiye gaye hai
 Means unknown million euros
 yani rafel vimaan kitne main kharida gaya, isko lekar sirf code verde istemaal he
 Now there is no mention in Rafael's report about what this Unknown Millin Euro is
 report padhane ke baad pataa chalata he ki kaig ne sarkaar kii ore se apanaai gai prakriya or uske javaabon kaa hi zyada zikr kiya he
 On the basis of Euro, Anon Millin has described the new deal as cheaper than the old deal
 lekin sawaal he ki ananon million euro
 
 
 
 kitni dhanrashi he
 
 
 In fact, in response to a question in Parliament in 2016 itself, the Modi government has stated that the cost of a Rafale aircraft without arms is Rs 570 crore
 magar ghamaasan vepanijd yani hathiyaaron se las rafel vimaan kii keemton par machataa rahaa he
 The government has been refusing to disclose the price of 36 armed Rafale aircraft, saying that certain conditions of the inter-governmental Agreement (IGA) between India and the government on the purchase of aircraft do not allow it
 sarkaar yah kahati ai he ki rashtriya suraksha or agreement kii gopneeyata se judi sharton ke maddenjar vah asli keemton kaa khulaasa nahin kar sakati
 The opposition has also been raising the demand to make the real prices of Rafale planes public every time

 By calling a meeting in Nagpur just before the Lok Sabha elections, the high command has made it clear that it will be well if the Sangh and the BJP go together
 bijepi ke bannron, postaron se pata nagpur
 There is no election here, but there is definitely preparation before the election bugle
 bhaajapa teen dinon tak rashtriya parishad auki karbokarini kii baithak kar chunavi agenda tay karegi lekin agenda tay karne se pehle bijepikichintaa ye bhi he ki kunbe ko kaise majboot karenor kaise puraa parivaar ek hokar jang main utre
 The electoral agenda of the BJP will be decided in a debate of three days, but after meeting in Nagpur, the party has already given this message that if the agenda will run, it will belong to the Sangh Parivar

 After recent statements by the Congress Vice President on the empowerment of women and the increasing incidence of crime against women, the question arises whether the issues related to women are resonating even in the ears of lawmakers sitting in Parliament
 ab jabaki 15veen loksabhaa kaa kaarykaal puraa hone ja rahaa he to aise main yah sawaal puche jane kii sakht jarurat aa padi he ki itnaa bad-chadhakar bolne vaale hamaare saansad kya mahilaon ke adhikaron ko surakshit rakhane ke liye bhi kanoon banaaenge
 Examining the work done so far in this direction shows that the laws made in Parliament on women's issues are superficial and immediate
 kanoonon ko paarit karne main jahaan kul milakar sansadeey susti rahi he, vahiin mahilaon ke muddon par vidhaayi kadam sakriy hone kii bajaae dabaav main uthaae jane vaale rahe hai
 Even if a law is made, it is made only after the huge demand of the public or by the intervention of the judiciary
 agar is par gaur kiya jaae ki 15veen loksabhaa ne mahilaon ke muddon par kitna kaam kiya to do khaas prayaas dikhaai dete hai
 In 2001, the Law Commission and earlier the National Commission for Women recommended reforms in the Indian Penal Code to ensure tougher punishment in crimes against women - including sexual offenses ranging from acid attacks
 iske baavjood sansad main yah vidheyak 2012 main jaakar pesh kiya gaya or in siforeeshon par kadam uthaane kii shuruyaat tab hui, jab dilli ke bahucharchit gang rape ke baad sarkaar par baari dabaav padaa
 Ultimately, Parliament paid attention to this and in March 2013 the Penal Code (amendment) Bill was passed to take stringent measures for crimes against women
 jahaan yah jaruri he ki vidhayika ko jan bhaawanaaon ke prati samvedansheel hona chahie, vahiin yah baat chintajanak he ki bade kanoonee badlaav tabhi kiye gaye jab janata sadakon par utar kar aawaaj uthaane lagi
 Take the Vishaka judgment in 1997 in the case of sexual harassment at the workplace, the Supreme Court had set certain guidelines to prevent sexual harassment of women at the workplace
 vishakha disha-nirdeshon ne yon utpeeda ko paribhaashit kiya or niyokta dwaara ise rokane ke upayon kii ek aachaar samhita banaai
 But Parliament passed the Act in 2013 to protect women from sexual harassment at the workplace
 iske praavdhaanon ko prabhavi banane vaale kanoon or niyam pichley saal disambar main banaae gaye, vah bhi tab jab yon utpeeda kii lagaataar badhati ghatnaon ko media ne sabake saamne rakhaa
 Parliament did not show as much urgency to give more representation to women in political positions
 kai samitiyaan or sansthaaen varshon se sansad or rajnatik partiyon main mahilaon ko aarakshan die jane kii jarurat kii vakaalat kar chuki hai
 Three proposals for reservation of women in elected bodies are currently pending for approval by Parliament
 mahila aarakshan bill main loksabhaa or vidhansabhaon main mahilaon ke liye ek-tihaai siten arakshit karne kaa praavdhaan rakhaa gaya he
 In the 110th and 112th Constitutional Amendment Bill, this reservation in panchayat and municipality has been increased from one-third of the total seats to 50 percent
 ye sabhi vidheyak agar 15veen loksabhaa ke aakhri satr main bhi paarit nahin kiye jate hai to ye bekaar ho jaaenge
 The lack of political will to pass these Bills shows that all previous attempts to legislate for reservation for women in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies have failed
 isi makasad ko lekar 1996, 1998 or 1999 main kai vidheyak pesh kiye gaye, lekin un loksabhaaon ke bhang hone se sab bekaar ho gaye
 In other matters related to women's issues, Parliament has not used its authority more judiciously to make laws
 udhaaharan ke liye, vivaah kanoon (sanshodhan) vidheyak main talaak or vivaah ke kanoonon main sanshodhan kii maang kii gai he
 The bill seeks to make fixed marriage a new basis for divorce and allows the court to assess the property inherited or later inherited by the husband while determining compensation for wife and children
 do
 mahilaon kaa ashleel chithran kanoon kaa ek sanshodhan mahilaon se sambandhit kisi bhi aisi saamagree ke prakaashan yaa vitaran ko pratibandhit karata he jo mahila ke liye ashobhaneey ho
 This also applies to new means of communication such as Internet, satellite-based communication and cable television
 iske alaava aisa pehla kendriya vishvavidhyalay banane kaa bhi prastaav he jo sirf mahilaon ke liye ho taaki unhen ucch shiksha or naukariyon ke behatar avasar mil saken
 But Parliament has not passed any of these bills
 yah chintaa kaa vishay he ki sansad ne mahilaon se jude muddon ko chaltau tareeke se hal kiya he, na ki soch-vichaar kar
 The time has come for our law makers to make a fundamental effort to make laws with a sincere mind, and not before due to immediate reasons for pressure

 shamsher or manju donon ko ramlila vaali yaa yun kahe ghatana vaali raat graminon ne ek saath dekha tha
 According to the villagers, Shamsher and Manju fell in love with each other and perhaps the love of the two did not go well with anyone, as a result of which Shamsher's body was found hanging from a mango tree outside the village

 CRPF jawan Mujahid Khan was martyred in the terrorist attack in Karan Nagar in Jammu and Kashmir recently
 bihar ke bhojpur ke rahane vaale mujahid khan ko buudhvaar ko unke paitruk gaanv pero main supurd-e-khaak kiya gaya
 The problem for the martyr's family was that none of the representatives of the Bihar government, be it mlas or ministers, reached the son-in-law
 haalanki, shahid ke antim sanskaar ke 24 ghante ke baad aakhirkaar bihar sarkaar ke khanan mantri or bhojpur jile ke prabharee mantri vinod singh shahid ke parivaar waalon se milane unke paitruk gaanv pahunche
 After reaching the village, the minister paid tribute to the martyr Mujahid Khan
 shahid kii antim yatraamein shaamil nahin hone ko lekar mantri ne mujahid khan ke parivaar waalon ke saamne daleel pesh kii ki vah buudhvaar ko apane grih jila katihaar main the, jahaan par vah shivaratri kii puja kar rahe the
 When Aaj Tak asked the minister what was the reason for the martyr's failure to attend the funeral, the minister said that the distance from Katihar to Bhojpur is 650 km and it takes 2 days to cover this distance
 magar phir bhi unhone shahid ke bare main khabar milte hi 15 ghante main katihaar se bhojpur kaa rasta naap diya or guuruuvaar ko shahid ke paitruk gaanv pahunch sake
 On the other hand, in the last visit of his son, there is still anger among the family members for not having any representation from the Bihar government
 mujahid khan ke pita abdul khayr ne kaha ki vah ab buudhe ho chale hai nahin to apane shahid bete kii hui is beijjati ko vah bardaasht nahin karte
 The family accused the Bihar government that the martyr's family is Muslim, so no representative of the Bihar government came to share his sorrow
 parivaar waalon ne prashasan ke dwaara bihar sarkaar kii taraf se die gaye 5 lakh rupye muaavje ke check ko bhi sweekaar karne se manaa kar diya he
 While meeting the family members, the minister assured that he will meet Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi to give vent to their displeasure over the compensation of the family, but in spite of this, the family did not get any relief
 shahid mujahid khan ke bhai meraaj khan ne kaha ki mujahid kii maut aatankwaadiyon se ladate hue hui he or aise main 5 lakhon rupye kaa muaavja kaaphi kam he
 The martyr's brother demanded that the Bihar government give him a compensation of Rs 25 lakh and provide a job to a family member

 Manish Sisodia lashed out at the Modi government
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi dilli kii shiksha vyavastha ko barbaad karnaa chaahate hai
 Manish Sisodia expressed displeasure at the removal of 9 advisors
 unhone kaha ki bijepi sarkaar ne unki salaahkaar aatishi marlena ko isliye nishaanaa banaaya, kyonki unhone shiksha vyavastha ke sudhaar main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he

 There were incidents of violence in several parts of the state during a one-day bandh organized by the Valmiki community in Punjab on Saturday, accusing them of allegedly distorting historical facts against a TV serial
 janajivan ast-vyast rahaa
 In these incidents, a young man has also been shot in Jalandhar
 band or hinsa kii ghatnaon ke baad mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne tatkaal dharawahik kaa prasaaran band karne kaa aadesh diya he
 He has also warned against attempts to break communal harmony in the state
 rajya main ek din ke band kaa aahvaan karne vaali sanstha valmiki ection samiti kaa daawa he ki colors tivi par prasaarit dharawahik 'ram siya ke lav kush' main bhagwaan ke khilaaf aapattijanak tippaniyan kii gai hai
 His false image has been projected and historical facts have been tampered with
 isse unki dharmik bhaavana aahat hui he
 The organization has demanded that the nationwide broadcast should be banned and its directors and actors deliberately arrested under sections of the Indian Penal Code for intentionally offending religious sentiments
 adhikariyon ne yahaan kaha ki jalandhar, amritsar, hoshiyarpur, kapoorthala, fagawada or ferozepur main vyavsaayik pratishthan band rahe
 They were closed at some of these places
 band se ludhiana aanshik rup se prabhavit hua tha
 However, drug stores, clinics and ambulance services were exempted from the shutdown
 jalandhar main ek yuvak ko goli lagi he, jiskaa baad main oparation kiya gaya
 Officials said violent incidents were reported from several places, including the conflict in Fazilka

 In order to declare the party's candidate for Rajya Sabha, Samajwadi Party (SP) National President Mulayam Singh Yadav was holding a parliamentary board meeting at his residence
 amar singh kaa zikr aate hi cabinet mantri ajam khan kii tyoriyaan chadh gayi
 When not a single Muslim got a place in the list of seven candidates, Azam left the meeting in protest
 do din baad dilli kii jama masjid ke shahi imam moulana saiyad ahamed bukhari bhi rajyasabha ummidavaaron ke chayan main musalamaanon kii upeksha par virodh darj karaane mulaayam ke ghar pahunche
 Mulayam made his stand by asking two Muslims to send him to the Rajya Sabha in the last election, but refused to do so this time due to some 'compulsions'
 kuch aisi hi 'majaburi' musalamaanon ke voton par daavedaari kar rahi bahujan samaaj party (bispi) kii bhi thi
 Bypassing the suggestions of some big leaders of western UP, BSP supremo Mayawati fielded Satish Mishra and Ashok Siddharth on the two Rajya Sabha seats of his party's quota
 upi main musalmaan maton kii daavedaar do sabase badi partiyaan 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle apane buniyadi jaateey sameekaran sahejane main aisi uljhi hai ki ve rajyasabha chunaav main ek adad musalmaan ummidavaar ke liye jagah nahin bana sakin
 For the first time in the 2012 assembly elections, UP had the highest number of 64 Muslim mlas (see box), but after two years no Muslim candidate could win the Lok Sabha election
 agar jari chunaav prakriya ko bhi shaamil kar len to pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke baad upi kii 21 rajyasabha siton par hue chunaav main jeetne vaale musalmaan ummidavaaron kii sankhya 2 hi rahegi (november, 2014 main sapa se jite the)
 Apparently, political parties claiming parity 19 in the total population of UP
 3 fisadi (strotah 2011 janaganana) hissedari vaale musalamaanon ko uchit pratinidhitiv dene main naakaam sabit hui hai
 The politics of Muslim voters has come to the forefront in the midst of the crisis over the issue and identity of the voters
 isse assam ke vidhansabha chunaav kii tarah upi main bhi musalmaan voton main bantwaare kii patakatha taiyaar hoti dikhti he
 Special eye on the West The BSP, which did not win a single seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, started leading the riot-stricken Muslims by handing over the command of Western UP to its Muslim face Nasimuddin Siddiqui
 siddiki ne peedit musalamaanon se lagaataar sampark kar na sirf unhen mayawati ke sushasan kii yaad dilaai balki us naaraazgi ko bhi kam karne kii koshish kii jo mujffarnagar ke dange ke baad bispi kii upeksha se upji thi
 They have announced Muslim candidates by holding meetings in more than 60 assembly seats in western UP, including Muslim-majority districts (see graphics)
 musalamaanon main bispi kii badhati paith se nibatane ke liye sapa ne pichley saal musalmaan dharmaguruon se kareebi rakhane vaale muradanagar ke aashu malik ko vidhanparishad sadsy banaaya or baad main amroha ke kamaal akhtar ko cabinet mantri bana sapa sarkaar main musalmaan mantriyon kii sankhya 11 tak pahunchaa di
 Despite this, after losing the assembly by-elections in the Muslim-dominated Deoband and Muzaffarnagar seats, the alarm bells have been sounded for him
 mulaayam ulema ke saath baithken kar sachhar cameti kii siforishein lagu karne, aatankwaad ke naam par band begunaah musalamaanon kii rihaai jaise chunavi vaadon ke puraa na hone par safai de rahe hai
 Further, the SP government is going to send a proposal to amend the constitution to provide reservation to Muslims
 vahiin congressi kaaryakartaaon ne bhi ranneetikaar prashanth kishor se purv vidhayak imran masood ko pashchimi upi main party kaa cheharaa banane kii maang kii he
 Masood, who was a Congress candidate from Saharanpur in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, was jailed for making a controversial speech against Narendra Modi
 ajam banaam nasimuddin siddikiane vaala vidhansabha chunaav upi kii muslim raajnneeti main do suramaaon ke kaushal kii bhi pariksha legaa
 The Muslim face of BSP and National General Secretary Nasimuddin Siddiqui are gaining support by reminding them of Mayawati's reign by contacting the dargahs of the state and Muslim religious leaders
 ve agar sanghathan ke maahir khilaadi ke taur par ubhare hai to sapa ne ek baar phir ajam khan ko aage kar vidhansabha chunaav main samarthan batorne kii taiyaari kii he
 In the way the top SP leaders stood with Azam in a dispute with Governor Ram Naik in March, in this Rampur strongman, with the intention of Muslims to vote
 apni talkh or bebaak bayaanbaji ke liye mashhoor ajam ke jariye sapa kii kattar bayaanbaji karne vaale aal india majalis-e-itihadul muslimin (emiem) ke rashtriya adhyaksh tathaa hyderabad ke saansad asaduddin ovaisi ko upi main prabhaavaheen karne kii ranneeti he
 The BJP is also working on a strategy to stop the anti-party polarization in Muslims amid the staunch rhetoric of Azam and Owaisi
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke padaadhikari indresh kumaar kii saraparasti main bane muslim rashtriya manch ne pichley ek saal main upi main dedh darjan se zyada ulema conference kaa aayojan kiya he
 In the coming month of Ramadan, the Sangh has made preparations to increase brotherhood with Muslims on the pretext of Rosa Iftar Party
 vahiin kendriya alpsankhyak kalyaan mantri najma hepatulla ne pehle charan main desh main sabase adhik upi main dedh darjan se adhik madrason main skill deveopment centre khol musalamaanon ko bijepi ke vikaas agenda se jodgaye kii koshish kii he
 Barelvi — Deobandi has a dispute between Deobandi and Barelvi Maslak for the past one year over the ownership of the iconic Qutubkhana mosque in Bareilly, the city of the tug of war
 maamla vakf board main lambit he or masjid par taala latak rahaa he
 The SP government is afraid of getting angry with the other when a decision is made in favor of one community and that is why the case has been kept hanging
 ruhelkhand ilaake main shahjahanpur, pilibhit or bareli shahar barelvi masalak ke garh hai jabaki rampur, muradabad main devbandiyon kaa prabhaav he
 Barelvi is angry with the SP government for the wavering attitude of the state government in the Qutubkhana mosque case which has come up for discussion since the posting of Barelvi Imam
 sapa ke khilaaf barelvi samudaay main badhati naaraazgi ko 'cash' karaane ke liye bispi ke rashtriya mahasachiv nasimuddin siddiki 2 farvari ko dargah aalaa hazrat par hajiri lagane pahunche
 So the SP also nominated the famous Urdu poet Wasim Barelvi as a member of the Legislative Council and made his known bets to remove the resentment among the Muslims
 udhar shiya musalamaanon kii acchhee-khaasi taadaad vaale lakhanu main shiya dharmaguru kalbe javwaad ne vakf sampattiyon par ho rahe kabje ke virodh main sapa sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha khol rakhaa he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Shia Muslims supported the then candidate Rajnath Singh from Lucknow Lok Sabha seat
 saansad banane ke baad bhi rajnath ne lagaataar shiya kaaryakramon main jaakar unka samarthan batorne kii koshishen jari rakhi hai
 In the small eastern region, Muslim politics is not being heard in the politics of parties like SP, BSP as in western UP
 purvanchal main sapa kaa musalmaan cheharaa ambedkar nagar se aane vaale cabinet mantri ahamed hasan hai to bispi ne kabhi pashchimi upi main party kii musalmaan raajnneeti ko paravaan chadhaane vaale munkad ali ko purvi jilon kii kaman saunpi he
 The reality is that Ahmed Hasan and Munkad Ali have not been able to make inroads among the Muslims of Purvanchal and this has given small parties a chance to spread their footing here
 purvanchal main bunakaron kii behatari ke liye kaam kar rahe swayamsevi arshad mansuri bataate hai, ''purvi jilon main musalamaanon kaa pichhadaapan mukhya mudda he
 Large political parties active in UP have failed to communicate with Muslims at present
 isi khalipan ne chote muslim dalon ke liye jagah banaai he
 "MIM has given full force in Purvanchal to fill this space
 farvari main hue bikapur, faijabad ke vidhansabha upachunaav main 12,000 se zyada vot batorne vaali emiem ko rajnatik vishleshak 'vot katwa' ke rup main dekh rahe hai, jo bade dalon kaa khel bigaad sakate hai
 In the last assembly election, the bsp's presence in the BSP was lost in a close contest with the SP in several seats in Purvanchal
 isi tarah agle vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ko ovaisi kii party nuksaan pahunchaa sakati he
 Wasim Barelvi immediately heard a few lines on a question related to politics and Muslims after being sworn in as a Legislative Council member at the Vidhan Bhavan on 30 April: We feel that like fragrance, we are no noise that will be heard
 vidambnaa yah ki rajnatik partiyaan musalamaanon ko ab bhi mahaj vot bank kii tarah hi mahasoos kar rahi hai

 Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal, while appealing to the diaspora to help the diaspora Indians with 'body, mind and wealth' in the assembly elections to be held in Punjab, said that if a party government is formed in the state, then a Dalit should be placed on the chief minister's chair

 Is close to america kaa bhi isi tarah kaa aankalan tha
 The then-susceptible CIA report claimed that if India's concerns escalate in the next two or three months, we believe that the conditions may be such as Prime Minister Gandhi's decision to primarily demolish Pakistan's nuclear facilities
 To provide a framework, a military confrontation should be initiated with Pakistan
 report likhane ke samay siie ne kaha ki gandhi ne is sambandh main is tarah kaa koi faisla nahin kiya
 According to the report, as Pakistan was in the final stages of making plutonium and rich uranium for use in nuclear weapons, Gandhi gave a clear answer to this threat by authorizing Indian nuclear test preparations
 siie ne kaha ki farvari 1981 main kam samay main bhartiya pareekshan upkaran ke bhumigat visphot ko anumati dene ke liye thar marusthal main khudaai shuru kii gai

 At the time of writing the report, the CIA said that Gandhi did not take any such decision in this regard
 report ke anusaar, chunki pakistan parmaanu hathiyaaron main prayog ke liye plutonium or atisamrudh uranium banane ke antim charan main tha, gandhi ne is khatre kaa spasht jawaab bhartiya parmaanu pareekshan taiyaariyon ko adhikrut karke diya
 The CIA said excavations were started in February 1981 in the Thar Desert to allow underground detonation of Indian test equipment in a short period of time
 siie ne kaha ki may main bharat ne 40 kiloton parmaanu pareekshan ke liye taiyaariyaan puri kar lee thim
 He said that India was to explode the device about a week after a possible Pakistan test

 Two prominent activists, Prashant Bhushan and Swami Agnivesh, criticized the Supreme Court's refusal to demand a judicial inquiry or a special investigation team to investigate the death of Naxalite leader Cherukuri Rajkumar alias Azad in the encounter in 2010
 swami agnivesh or charchit vakil prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki yah maamla swatantra nyaayik ayog yaa vishesh jaanch dal se jaanch karaaye jane ke liye ‘puri tarah se feet maamla’ he
 The two said at a press conference in Delhi, 'the Supreme Court could have easily ordered a judicial inquiry into the case
 durbhaagya se usne aisa nahin kiya
 ' aapako pehle hi bataa den ki in dinon desh main charchaa kaa vishay bana hua biechayu kii chaatraon kaa andolan vahaan ke kulapati girish chandra treepathi kii najar main 'rajinithik phaayde' kii manshaa ke chalate hua tha or puraa maamla mahaj ek chhedchhad kii 'saamaanya ghatana' thi
 Here we are going to tell you 10 such statements given by him in an interview given recently about the BHU case, which you may also say by reading that it is better to remain silent
 banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati dwaara ladakiyon ke saath hue kathith yon utpeedan ke maamle ko chhedchhad kii 'saamaanya ghatana' bataane ke baad vah khabaron main to aae hi saath hi saath soshal media par bhi unki jamkar fajihat hui
 Vice Chancellor Girish Chandra Tripathi also believes that the incident in the BHU campus was 'deliberately' brought to the fore a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to his parliamentary constituency
 aapako bataa den ki biechayu parisar main ek chaatra ke saath hui chhedhkhani or uske shikaayat karne ke baad bhi surakshakarmi dwaara uski madad na kiye jane ke baad vahaan kii tamaam chaatraon ne apni suraksha kii maang ke saath kuch anya maangon ko lekar pradarshan shuru kar diya tha
 According to VC Tripathi, the protest was politically motivated and "some people were motivated by the incident due to vested interests and erratic intentions"
 He also said that it was manipulated to provoke this before PM Modi's visit
 
 biechayu kii chaatraon ne daawa kiya he ki vishvavidhyalay main koi ladki nahin he jise parisar main pareshaan naa kiya gaya ho yaa phir uske saath chhedchhad naa hui ho
 However, BHU VC Girish Chandra Tripathi has a different story
 ab padhie visi treepathi ke wo 10 bayaan
 
 
 1- “sometimes there are issues and some issues arise
 yah mudda banaaya gaya tha
 i think this problem was created by outsiders and the shape that this case eventually took is even more unfortunate than the initial incident
 "2- "sabase pehle, yah yon utpeedan kii ghatana nahin he, yah ekachedchhad kaa maamlahai
 The "3-" students stood for something that looked like truth but was a lie
 "4- "yadi ladakiyon par force kaa istemaal kiya gaya, to mujhe koi jaankaree nahin he
 "5-" This is quite a large campus, anything can happen anywhere
 ham har chaatra ko guard nahin de sakate
 The "6-" force was used against criminals, not against female students
 aisi sthiti thi ki force kaa istemaal karnaa padaa
 "7-" If we start listening to every demand of every girl then we will not be able to run university
 "8- "yah acha he ki memavi or triveni ladakiyon kehostel ke liye karfu samayraat 8 baje he, ek anya ladakiyon ke chatravaas main to yah shaam 6 baje he
 "9- Professor Tripathi says," The protest of the girl students is on a small incident
 "10- "ladakon or ladakiyon ke liye suraksha kabhi bhi samaan nahin ho sakati
 " pioke main aatanki thikaanon par 29 sitambar ko bhartiya sena ke sargical strike kii jaankaree khud dijiemo leftinent general ranbir singh ne di
 It was a new thing for the people of the country to cross the loc and carry out the operation of the army and then give information about it in the press conference
 phir sawaal bhi uthe ki kya bhartiya sena ne pehali baar elosi paar kar sargical strike ko anjaam diya? kya pehle kabhi bhartiya sena ne aisa nahin kiya? aise main kuch daawey saamne aae ki pehle bhi bhartiya sena kii ore se is tarah ke oparation kiye jate rahe hai lekin kabhi unki jaankaree saarvajanik nahin kii gai
 'india Today / Aaj Tak' tried to delve into the past of surgical strikes
 iskaa jo nateeja saamne aayaa wo chaunkaane vaala he
 At least 9 times in the last 18 years, the Indian Army has crossed the loc to carry out operations and taught the Pakistani Army a lesson
 is daur main bhartiya sena kii ore se elosi paar karne kii pehali ghatana may 1998 main hui
 At the same time, before the recent surgical strike of 29 September, the Indian fighter crossed the loc in August 2013
 in donon ghatnaon ke bich main bhi 1999 kii garmi, janvari 2000, march 2000, sitambar 2003, june 2008, agast 2011 or janvari 2013 main bhi bhartiya sena ne oparations ke liye 7 baar elosi paar kii
 Between May 1998 and August 2013, the Indian government neither publicly accepted nor gave information about the 9 operations carried out by the LOC Crosser, that while executing these operations, both sides of the loc were carried out
 What a loss
 desh ke ucch padasth intelegence sutron or sena ke ritred adhikariyon se baat karne ke alaava 'india today / aaj tak' ne beete do dashak kii media reports ko cross check kiya
 On the basis of this, you are getting the details of 9 operations crossed the loc in the east of the Indian Army
 1
 May 1998 Pakistan itself complained to the United Nations of the operation of the Indian Army in 1998
 sanyukt raashtra kii vaarshik kitaab 1998 ke pej 321 par ye shikaayat darj he
 Accordingly, on 4 May, Pakistan said in the complaint that 22 people were killed in Bandala Seri, 600 meters across the loc in pok
 pakistan gaanv main maujuud kuch chashmadidon ke hawaale se ye bhi bataaya gaya, 'kareeb ek darjan shaks, kaale kapadon main aadhi raat ko aae
 He also left a few pamphlets on which one wrote - 'badla Brigade'
 vahiin duusare parche par likhaa tha- 'bure kaam kaa bura nateeja
 It was written on another pamphlet - 10 eyes for one eye, full jaw for one tooth
 'pakistan kii ore se jab is hamale ke liye bharat sarkaar par ungali uthaai gai to nai dilli kii ore se jimmedaari lene se inkaar kar diya gaya
 However, it was believed by some American officials at the time that this action was taken in return for killing 26 Indian citizens in the villages of Pathankot and Dhakikot
 2
 Summer: During the Kargil War in the summer of 19991999, the Indian Army contingent crossed the loc from the Munawar Tawi river near Jammu
 is oparation main pakistan kii ek puri chaowkee ko uda diya gaya
 Pakistan formed the Border Action Team (BAT) after the same incident
 isamen pakistan ke special sarvice group (SAG) ke commando ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 The BAT is considered responsible for beheading an Indian soldier in January
 3
 January 2000: 6 months after the Kargil War, on 21-22 January 2000, 7 Pakistani soldiers were allegedly claimed to have been captured during the raid at a post in the Nadala Enclave across the Neelum River
 pakistan ke mutabik ye saaton sainik bhartiya sainikon kii golibari main ghayal hue the
 The bodies of these soldiers were later returned to Pakistan
 akhbaar 'da hindu' kii report ke mutabik pakistani dijiemo ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya tha ki pakistan ne is ghatana ko jaanboojhkar zyada tool nahin diya
 According to this official, it was only a few days after General Musharraf was overthrown and he did not want to create a lot of noise on it and a crisis with India again
 bhartiya sena ke sutron kaa kahana tha ki bhartiya sena kii ore se ye karrwai captain saurabh kaaliya or 4 jat regiment ke paanch javaanon- sipaahi bhavar laal bagariyaa, arjuna ram, bhikha ram, mula ram or naresh singh kii shahadat ke baad kii gai thi
 4
 march 2000sutron kaa kahana he ki kargil yuddh ke baad elosi par tainaa 12 bihar batalian ke captain gurjinder singh inphantry batalian commando (ghaatak) kii team ke saath elosi paar jaakar pakistani chaowkee par dhaava bolaa
 This was a retaliation for the previous attack by the Pakistani Army
 bharat ke is oparation main captain suri shahid ho gaye
 He was posthumously awarded the Mahavir Chakra
 isi dauraan 2 march 2000 ko lashkar e taiyaba ke aatankiyon ne ek hamale main 35 sikhon kii hatya kii
 Then, on behalf of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, 9 paras (special forces) were allowed to cross the border and take action
 iske baad special force ke major kii aguai main bhartiya sainikon ne elosi paar jaakar 28 pakistani sainikon or aatankwaadiyon kaa kaam tamaam kiya
 5
 sitambar 20032003 main elosi par donon deshon main sijafire lagu hone ke baad se duusare kii jameen par jaakar hone vaale oparation kii kam hi jaankaree uplabdh he
 But complaints lodged by Pakistan to the United Nations Remittance Group (UNMOGIP), which monitored the loc, show that cross border operations continue unabated
 pakistan ne ek shikaayat main daawa kiya ki bhartiya sainikon ne 18 sitambar 2003 ko poonch ke bhimbar gali ke paas baroh sector main ek post par hamalaa kiya
 In this incident, 4 soldiers including Pakistani jcos were killed
 6
 Even at least twice in June 20082008 such incidents occurred
 ye wo saal tha jab elosi par takaraav kii ghatnaayen badhane lagi thim
 According to Pakistan's record of complaints, four Pakistani soldiers were killed in action by Indian soldiers on 19 June 2008 in the Bhattal sector of Poona
 isse pehle 5 june 2008 ko poonch ke salhotri gaanv main kranti border nigaraanee post par hamalaa hua tha jisame 2-8 gurkha regiment kaa jawan jawashwar chaame shahid hua tha
 7
 agast 201130 agast 2011 ko pakistan ne shikaayat darj karai ki uske ek jesio samet chaar jawan kel main neelam nadi ghati ke paas bhartiya sena kii karrwai main maare gaye
 The newspaper 'the Hindu' quoted sources on the incident as saying that the operation was carried out in exchange for the killing of two Indian soldiers and their dead bodies in an attack on Indian soldiers at Karnah
 8
 a report in the January 2013 'the Hindu' mentions an incident of January 6, 2013
 6 janvari 2013 kii raat ko cross border firing ke baad 19 inphantry divijan commander gulab singh ravat ne pakistani post par hamalaa karne kii ijaajat maangi
 Indian soldiers were being targeted from this Pakistani post
 pakistan kii ore se phir kaha gaya ki sawan paatra main sthit uski post par bhartiya sainikon ne hamalaa kiya
 However, India denied Pakistan's claim at that time
 bhartiya sena ke tatkaaleen pravaktaa jagadish dahia ne kaha- 'hamaare kisi bhi sainik ne elosi ko paar nahin kiya
 a senior official in Delhi said on the incident, 'it should be seen as such
 sawan paatra ko nishaanaa banane ke liye elosi paar jane kii aupchaarik anumati nahin thi
 But such things keep happening in the heat of stress
 pakistan aisa karata he, hamaari sena aisa karti he
 This has been going on since the fighting started in Jammu and Kashmir in 1990
 '9
 August 2013 In early August 2013 Jafran Ghulam Sarwar, Wajid Akbar, Mohammad Wajid Akbar and Mohammad Faisal left their homes in the occupied territory of Pakistan in the Neelum Valley, but never returned thereafter
 bharat kaa kahana tha ki use nahin pataa ki in logon kaa kya hua
 According to Pakistan, a few days after the disappearance of these four came the news that five unknown people were killed in the firing of Indian soldiers
 inke shav elosi ke paar 500 meter dur bharat ke kabje vaale kshetra main paae gaye
 At that time, the spokesman of the Indian Army, Naresh Vij said, 'no body was found and he (pakistan) has been lying like this
 ' haalanki sector main tainaat bhartiya khufia adhikariyon ne of da record mana tha ki ye log vastav main special forcej kii karrwai main maare gaye the
 However, these intelligence officials also believed that all these people were from the Jihadi organization and wanted to infiltrate the loc
 in adhikariyon ke mutabik sena kisi bhi nirdosh naagarik ke khilaaf kabhi koi karrwai nahin karti
 These were the 9 incidents of the last 18 years when the Indian Army crossed the loc and carried out the operation
 in 9 oparations main sirf may 1998 ke pehle oparation ko hi pakistan ne aadhikarik taur par kabool kiya
 On the condition of anonymity of all other operations, Indian officials admitted that they were in reality
 aise main is sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki beete 18 saal main or bhi kai oparations hue honge lekin bharat or pakistan donon kii taraf se hi unhen tool nahin diya gaya
 This happened because there was not much tension on the outskirts
 90 ke dashak ke aakhri varshon ke baad elosi par, kam se kam bharat kii taraf, kai ahm badlaav aae hai
 Now there is a three-tier security
 remote control se sanchalit mashin gan, jamini or moshan sensors, drones ke jari montering or atyaadhunik nae nirmaan aadi sabhi kuch yahaan dekhe ja sakate hai
 But despite all this, operations continued to go beyond the loc throughout this period
 yani pakistan kii ore se aise badlaav nahin hue jisase elosi ko abhedya mana ja sake
 As far as the truth about the surgical strike of the Indian Army of 29 September has been revealed, it has been told by the DGMO
 lekin is sargical strike ke hone par hi sawaal uthaane vaale itihaas par jarur nazar daal len
 Such operations have been done on both sides before crossing the loc

 In such a situation, it is believed that if Rahul and the opposition are able to help the Dalits, then this bet can prove to be a big blow for the BJP in 2019

 Aram Nagar is near Versova in Andheri suburb of Mumbai

 After independence, it was made a transit camp for Hindus who came from Karachi and Sindh
 is samay yahaan ankhon main sapane liye yuva aate hai
 The dreams of some of these are fulfilled to some extent, then some are seen standing in front of these offices every year with new hope
 darasal, isi aaraam nagar-2 main kai kala paarkhiyon ke daftar hai jo pratibhashali kalakaaron ke sapane puure karne kaa kaam karte hai
 In cinematic language, he is called casting director
 actor banane kaa sapana dekhnaa jitna aasaan he usase kai guna kathin kaam he kisi ko actor bananaa
 This experience was made by Bollywood's famous casting directors Jogi Malang, Mukesh Chhabra, Shruti Mahajan and Kunal M
 shah ne bhi mahasoos kiya he
 Today a large number of films are made and crores of rupees are spent on the production of films
 film nirmaan ek bijness he or koi bhi nirmaataa kisi bhi vajah se film kaa bajet badhanaa nahin chahta
 With this, no such weak actor is taken in the film whose acting will make the film roll at the box office
 ek film ke vyavsaay se darjanon logon ke ghar kaa chulhaa jalataa he, film kii team kii ore se iskaa puraa kchayaal rakhaa jaataa he
 But such new artists have no idea of this, who come to Mumbai to work in films without testing their ability
 casting diarector kunchaal em
 Shah says, "most of the young people who have come to Mumbai to aspire to become Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Ranbir Singh and Varun Dhawan have no idea how much these artists have sweated to make a place in this industry
" " namchin casting diarector shruti mahajan kaa apana alag anubhav he, ''punjab se aane vaale gore-chittey ladakon kaa luk or cheharaa acha hota he
 But his parents often make the assumption that his son is no less than Akshay Kumar and Ranbir Kapoor
 is maansikta ko badalane kii jarurat he
 In films, not only the face but the ability matters a lot
 "pehle ke jamaane main film ke hero-heroin ke alaava anya kalakaaron kaa chayan bhi nirmaataa-nirdeshak hi karte the yaa yah kaam film kii unit kaa koi sadsy kar letaa tha
 But now as the technology of filmmaking becomes modern, the crowd of newcomers is increasing
 aise main casting diarector puraa ek mahakama hi ban gaya he or in par jimmedaariyaan bhi zyada hai
 "first casting was done by Tigmanshu Dhulia in the film Bandit Queen," says casting director Mukesh Chhabra
 unke baad jogi malang or hani trehan ne ise aage badhaayaa
 In this sequence, i opened the company under my own name
 jis tarah se aaj abhinay, nirdesan or patakatha lekhan ke liye training skool he, usee tarah se aane vaale samay main casting diarector ke liye bhi skool khul jaaenge
 "jogi, Mukesh, Shruti and Kunal, etc
 believe that no one can cast anyone for any film because now according to the character, the perfect actor is needed
 inaki yah bhi raay he ki ab mumbai aa rahe yuva pehle se behatar hai
 They know that if they do not come fully prepared, they will not get work in any film
 casting diarector ko bhi cinema, theatre, litarechar or acting kii samaj honi chahie
 Whatever casting director will be weak in this, he will have trouble in choosing the right actor
 jogi khud bhi theatre ke manje hue kalakaar hai
 He was associated with Jannatya Manch influenced by Safdar Hashmi
 unhone habib tanwir or johra sahagal jaise kalakaaron ke saath kaam kiya he
 Mukesh also has a background in theater
 shruti korporate jagat se ai hai
 But he has also associated himself with theater
 yashraj films main ve nami casting diarector shanu sharma kii sahaayak rah chuki hai
 Casting is generally a bit easier for big budget films than for low budget films
 kalakaaron ko paise thode thik-thaak mil jate hai
 But if Mukesh believes that movies are big or small, casting is difficult for both
 mehnat donon main kerani padati he
 Jogi has his own assessment that the trend of short films has started in recent years
 isamen tay samay-seemaa main film shoot kerani padati he, isliye saare actor achche chahie hote hai
 There is no difficulty in this
 theatre kii prishthbhumi se aane vaale kalakaaron main acting kii bhukh hoti he
 Money does not matter much to them
 shruti kii suniye, ''jaise ek doctor ko beemaari thik karne main pareshaani aati he, usee tarah se ham actor kaa chunaav karte hai
 We understand what the script and directors want and do our work by talking to the production
 " idhar kunal kehete hai ki nae nirmaataa or nirdeshak bhi kam bajet main achche actor kii maang karte hai
 One has to work hard for this and then actors are also found
 "ab casting kaa kaam ek akelaa vyakti nahin kar saktaa
 This work is like a management
 isliye harek casting diarector kii apni ek team hoti he
 Many people work in it
 aakhir main casting diarector film ke nirdeshak se milakar kalakaaron kii suchi ko final karata he
 The scope of a casting director extends from city to village
 uske paas gaanv, theatre group, local sanstha ke kalakaaron kaa bank hota he
 Jogi, Mukesh, Shruti and Kunal say that when a local artist is needed in a film, then one has to go to that village or city and choose an actor
 jogi bataate hai ki ishkia main nandu naam kaa ek kirdaar tha jo nahin mil rahaa tha
 After much effort, it was discovered that there is a boy named Abhishek in Patna, Bihar, who is like Nandu
 yah ladkaa actor to nahin tha magar tha kamaal kaa
 Mukesh says that it took a year to select 400 characters for Gangs of Wasseypur
 shruti bhi maanati hai ki mairi com ke liye north-east main kalakaaron kaa chayan kaaphi chalanging tha
 Kunal explains that the character of Piya Vajpayee, the debutant artist in red, was not originally what was shown in the film
 unke kairactor ko upi kii ladki kaa banaaya gaya
 Since she is originally from Etawah in Uttar Pradesh and her bid is from there, her character was given the role in UP and she was cast in the film
 casting ke liye formula yah he ki kalakaaron kaa pehle intro (profile or luk photo) liya jaataa he
 They are then auditioned
 kairactor main feet baithne ke baad kalakaar ko film ke diarector ke paas le jaaya jaataa he
 In this way, the selection of artists has become easier
 jogi bataate hai ki sabase pehle ve script padhate hai or jo kairactor he, use apane andar mahasoos karte hai
 After this, we start the selection of artists
 mukesh bhi is prakriya se sahamat hai
 Shruti says that after a lot of auditions, the director likes the artist
 in casting diarectaron kaa maananaa he ki bhartiya film or televijan santhaan, rashtriya natya vidhyalay, bhaaratendu natya academy, shriram centre, bairi jon ke skool or madhya pradesh natya vidhyalay jaisi natya sansthaaon se jude yuvaaon ke aane se casting karne main bahut zyada pareshaani nahin aati
 Artists from such places know and understand the nuances of acting beforehand
 jogi kehete hai ki ab noujvaan sidhe munh uthaakar actor banane nahin chale aate
 There is an appetite for acting in them
 filmon main kaam maangane vaale khaskar bihar ke yuvaaon kii boli or bhashaa ko lekar hameshaa sawaal uthte rahe hai
 It is said that they do not speak good Hindi
 lekin casting diarectaron kaa maananaa he ki ab bhashaa koi samasya nahin
 Jogi says that apart from Bihar, UP, MP, Chandigarh and Punjab, youth are also coming from Haryana
 haryana sarkaar ne rohtak main ek skool kholaa he jahaan abhinay ke bare main sikhaaya jaataa he
 It is good that young people are coming from small areas with complete preparation
 ve bataate hai, ''bhashaa ko lekar mujhe madras cafe ke liye kalakaaron ke chayan main kathinaayee ai thi kyonki tamilnadu main hamen aise kalakaar chahie the jinhen tamil or hindi donon bhashaa aati ho
 It took me a month to select the artists
 shruti bataati hai ki mumbai or dilli ke alaava lakhanu, indore or bhopal main bhi acha tallent miltaa he
 Art, Literature and Theater background is available among the youth of Lucknow
 ve urdu-hindi donon bhashaaon par pakad rakhte hai
 Mukesh believes that the typical local dialect also helps us a lot
 lekin yuvaaon ko angreji-hindi siikhnaa jaruri he
 Jogi and Mukesh are from Delhi
 shruti jaipur se to kunal mumbai se hi hai
 They are well versed in the culture of their city and this helps them in casting
 jogi ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ve yuva kalakaaron ke madadgaar hai
 Mukesh and Shruti also do nothing to promote talent
 jo kalakaar jis kirdaar main feet hota he, uske liye casting diarector film ke nirdeshak ko kanvins karte hai
 Hence Mukesh's eyes recognized Rajkumar Rao, Sushant Singh Rajput and Amit Sadh
 unhone imtiyaaj ali kii lav aajkal, anuraag kashyap kii gangs aaf vasepur, chintuji, chennai express, kaay po che, haidar, dangal, shahid, rockstar or badlapur sahit darjanon filmon main casting kii apni kaabiliyat dikhaai he
 It can be said that casting direction is dull and tedious
 baavjood iske jogi ne bhavar, agnichakr, viki donor, madras cafe, piku, udaan, mathrubhumi, samay, dilli-6, ishkia, enech-10 jaisi filmein kii hai
 Jogi had said on seeing Ayushman Khurana that this is Vicky Donor
 shruti ne to apni kaabiliyat se bahut jaldi hi filmkaaron ko aakarshith kar liya tha or sanjay lila bhansaali ne to un par itnaa bharosa kiya ki unhone ramlila kii casting kii jimmedaari unako saunp di
 Along with this, he shortlisted actors for films like Bajirao Mastani, Padmavati, Mary Kom, Jai Gangajal
 kunal kam bajet kii filmon ke nirmaataaon kii pehali pasand hai
 He did casting for films like Lal Rang, Youngistan, Hate Story-2, Dangerous Ishq, Khiladi 786, Ankur Arora Murder Case
 unhone piya vaajapei, kiara adwani, mira chopra, tara aleesha beri ko apni pratibha dikhaane kaa mauka dilaayaa

 Pune will face Delhi in the 9th match of IPL 10
 pune ne T20 lig main jeet ke saath shuruyaat karte hue mumbai ko saat wicket se maat di, lekin duusare match main punjab ke kilaaf duusare match main glen maxwell kii tufaani pari ne use jeet se vanchit kar diya
 It is obvious that Pune, adorned with strong batsmen like Steve Smith, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Ajinkya Rahane, will try to get a rhythm against Delhi
 team main captain steve smith, ajinkya rahane, manoj tiwari or ben stokes ke balle kaa dhamaakaa fans dekh chuke hai
 Smith scored an unbeaten 84 off 54 balls in his first match this season but he failed in the second match
 rahane ne do maichon main 66 or 19 ran banaae hai
 Similarly, Manoj Tiwari scored an unbeaten 40 off 23 balls against Punjab but it was not enough for the team to win
 duusari ore ipel sizan ke sabase mahange videshi khilaadi stokes ne gend or balle, donon se acha pradarshan kiya he
 He scored 21 runs against Mumbai and took a wicket while Kings XI hit 50 runs for Punjab

 dhoni ne mumbai ke kilaaf naabad 12 or punjab ke kilaaf 5 ran banaae hai
 It will be interesting to see that cricket enthusiasts will get to see 'mahi' batting in this match
 ballebaazi main to pune majboot dikhaai de rahi he lekin ab tak khele donon maichon main gendbaazi kamazor kadi sabit ho rahi he
 Both Ashok Dinda and Stokes looked ineffective with the new ball, while Stokes was good with the old ball but how can anyone forget Dinda's last over against Mumbai
 dinda ke is over main 30 ran bane the
 South African leg-spinner Imran Tahir has tried to give some relief to Captain Smith
 taahir ne ab tak 5 wicket liye hai or ballebaazon ko pareshaan karne main koi kor kasar nahin chodi he
 On the other hand, for Delhi, the start of the team has not been good
 zahir khan and company ne aaarasibi ko 157 ran par bhale roak diya lekin jeet se 15 ran dur hi rahi
 Zaheer took 2 wickets against Bengaluru and Chris Morris took 3 wickets while Pat Cummins took one wicket
 ballebaazi kii baat karen to rishabh pant ko chhodkar dilli ke dileron ko qamar kasni hogi, khaaskar top order ke ballebaazon ko
 Sam Billings caught the rhythm but could not progress beyond 25 runs and the form of Karun Nair, who scored a second triple century for India in Tests, is now under question
 pehle match main chote lakshya ko hasil nahin kar paane kaa malaal zahir ko zarur hoga
 In such a situation, they may need to work on fresh strategies
 team ke purv captain mahendra singh dhoni ke fans ko unke helicopter shot kaa ab bhi intazaar he
 Dhoni has scored an unbeaten 12 against Mumbai and 5 against Punjab
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki cricketpremiyon ko is match main 'maahi' kii batting kaa jalawaa dekhne ko milegaa
 Pune looks strong in batting but in both matches played so far, bowling is proving to be a weak link
 nai gend se ashok dinda or stokes donon beasar dikhe, vahiin puraani gend se stokes achche rahe lekin mumbai ke kilaaf dinda kaa aakiri over koi kaise bhul saktaa he
 Dinda had 30 runs in this over
 captain smith ko kuch raahat kii saans dene kii koshish dakshin africa leg spinner imran taahir ne kii he
 Tahir has taken 5 wickets so far and has left no stone unturned to upset the batsmen
 duusari ore dilli kii baat kare to team ke liye shuruyaat acchhee nahin rahi he
 Zaheer Khan & Co
 stopped RCB for 157 runs but remained 15 runs away from victory
 bengaluru ke kilaaf zahir ne 2 or kris morris ne 3 wicket liye jabaki pat kamins ne ek wicket kiya
 Talking about batting, the Delhi daredevils, except Rishabh Pant, will have to tighten up, especially the top order batsmen
 sam billings ne lay zarur pakadi lekin 25 ran se aage nahin bad sake or test main bharat ke liye doosraa tihara shatak banane vaale karun nair kaa form ab sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Zaheer will definitely have the inability to achieve the small goal in the first match
 aise main unhen nae sire se ranneetiyon par kaam karne kii zarurat pad sakati he
 On the other hand, for Delhi, the start of the team has not been good

 The Pakistani army had beheaded another soldier Sudhakar Singh with him
 pakistani sainikon ke is barbar krity par desh main ubaal aa gaya tha
 At that time there was a lot of politics on the martyrdom of Hemraj
 lekin hemraj kii shahadat ko chah saal beete gaye parivaar madad ke liye dar dar bhatak rahaa he
 The government's promise is still on paper
 shahid hemraj kii patni dharmavati or unke teen bachche beete chah saal se ek daftar se duusare daftar ke chakkar laga rahe hai
 But till now neither he got a government job nor a petrol pump
 yahaan tak kii mathura ke kaint ilaake ke jis quarter main hemraj kii vidhwaa apane bacchon samet rah rahi he
 He is also getting evacuation notices
 hemraj kii vidhwaa dharmavati ne enditivi se kaha- chah saal biit gaye, na sarkari naukari mili or na petrolapump
 i have pleaded with Minister Rajnath Singh, and have visited many offices
 aane jane kaa haada lag jaataa he magar kaam hota nahin
 So now they have sat at home
 yah vahi shahid hemraj hai, jinaki shahad par narendra modi se lekar sushamaa swaraj ne chunavi bhaashanon main ek ke badale pakistan se das sir laane ke daawey kiye the
 After the martyrdom of Hemraj, the BJP left no stone unturned to make the Congress stand in the dock
 jamkar is mudde par raajnneeti bhi hui
 But today the government has forgotten the family of martyr Hemraj
 yahi nahin sarkaar se mili 25 lakh rupye main 10 lakh rupye kaa farjivada bhi unki patni ke saath ho chukaa he
 When a man who became a soldier of the army escaped with a million rupees by deceit

 Therefore, we have decided to bear the expenses

 Due to which questions are also being raised on Directorate of ex-servicemen Welfare
 shahid hemraj ke parivaar ko bhatakate dekh purv sainikon main bhi khaasi naaraazgi he
 Terming it unfortunate, retired Major General SP Sinha said that the Directorate of ex-servicemen Welfare was established to help ex-servicemen, but IAS officers are sitting there, what do they have to do with the families of martyrs and soldiers
 baharhaal, hemraj kii shahadat par raajnneeti karke siyaasi phayda lene waalon ko bhale shahid ke parivaar se ab hamadardi na ho, lekin border par tainaat javaanon ke parivaar ko agar apane haq ke liye dar dar thokar khaani pade to ye hamaare liye shame kii baat he

 kejariwal apane mantriyon ke saath aksar film dekhte theatre main kai baar dekhe ja chuke hai
 But this hobby of Kejriwal is not only a hobby, he sees the film not only for entertainment but also as a learning
 shaayad isliye kejariwal kaa kirdaar rupahale parde ke 'nayak' se miltaa julata dikhataa he
 Kejriwal has been the 'nayak' of the public, Arvind Kejriwal took oath as the Chief Minister of Delhi at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan, then there were posters of the film 'nayak' in the hands of the people gathered there
 in postaron main anil kapur kii jagah arvind kejariwal kii tasviir chaspa thi
 Kejriwal, who gave a new look to the role of the leader, was sometimes a center of attraction for the people due to the muffler and the simple veneer and sometimes his bid
 gaur karne vaali baat to ye he ki 'nayak' jahaan reel life main kamaal karata najar aayaa, vahiin kejariwal ne asal jindagi main 'nayak' jaise karname karke filmi 'nayak' ko pachhad rakhaa he
 Kejriwal's opinion on phone On the occasion of the completion of one year of Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi, Kejriwal and his ministers will give their opinion via phone
 14 farvari ko 'aap' ke mantri or khud kejariwal dilli kii janata se phone par baat karenge or unase feedback lenge
 According to party sources, the idea of celebrating his government's anniversary in this way has come to him from the film 'nayak'
 jisamen jarnlist se mukhyamantri bana ek shaks phone par janata kii shikaayatein sunata he or uskaa secretary unhen turant sulajhane kii koshish karata he
 Shivaji Rao said that after Kejriwal won the elections in Delhi, after Arvind Kejriwal has taken such swift decisions, then speaking of all the leaders is closed
 arvind kejariwal aam aadmi ke bich se uthakar mukhyamantri kii kursi tak pahunche
 He formed his own political party, but before that he was an income tax officer and a social worker
 'nayak' kaa hero shivaji raav gaekwad bhi ek aam aadmi tha jo ek tivi channel main maamuli reporter tha
 The film was well liked by the audience
 soshal site par bhi dhamal machaa chukaa he movie lavamukhyamantricageriwal ko pike, masaan, drushyam, airlift or vajeer jaisi filmein na sirf dekhte hue paaya gaya, balki in filmon kii charchaa bhi unhone soshal media par khub kii
 His inclination towards the film has also made headlines on social media
 kejariwal or vaishali main theatre hangaamaahal hi main kejariwal jab akshay kumaar kii film 'airlift' dekhne ke liye cinema haul pahunche, vahaan maujuud kuch logon ne unka swaagat 'modi-modi' ke naare lagaakar kiye
 In fact, Kejriwal along with Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia came to see the film at Asal Plaza in Vaishali, Ghaziabad
 ve aksar film dekhne jate rahete hai
 After hearing such slogans from the people, both of them also took a selfie without giving any reaction to it
