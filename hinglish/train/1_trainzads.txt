 He also denied Sandeep Kumar's claim of touching his wife's feet
 unhone kaha ki paanv chune kii baat to dur, sandip ne to kai baar mere saamne apni patni se gaali-galouj kiya tha
 He said that Sandeep's truth has been revealed by the arrival of the CD, but he is already like this

 The third Test match played between India and South Africa was over in 3 days with India scoring 215 and 173 runs, while The

 ipel ke dasven sijan ke khatm hone ke baad se hi phens agle sijan kaa intjaar karne lage hai
 The biggest reason for this is the return of Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals
 bisisiai dwaara in donon tiimon par do saal kaa pratibandh lagaaya gaya tha jo is saal khatm ho gaya
 However, before the start of the second season, Rajasthan Royals have sought permission from the BCCI to change the name of the team
 rajasthan team kii maalik jaipur ipel cricket privet limited company apana naam badalanaa chaahati he or isi ke chalate frenchiji ne board ke saamne ye maang rakhi he
 The BCCI is quite surprised by this demand of the Rajasthan Royals team, they feel that the franchise will make a big proposal in front of the board as soon as this small demand is met
 bisisiai ke ek adhikari ne ek angreji akhbaar ko die bayaan main kaha, unhone nivedan jarur kiya he lekin koi kaaran nahin bataaya ki aakhir vah team kaa naam kis liye badalanaa chaahate hai
 It is possible that after the ban by BCCI, Rajasthan Royals now want to start a new season with a new name
 ek taraf rajasthan team apana naam badalanaa chaahati he, to vahiin kings ilevan punjab team ne to apana gharelu maidan hi badalane kaa faisla kar liya he
 Punjab is the first team in the IPL to request the BCCI to change its home ground
 frenchiji maalikon kaa kahana he ki unhen punjab cricket association se khaas madad nahin milti he, saath hi mohali main unki team ke prashansakon kii sankhya kam hone kii vajah se unke munaafe par bhi asar padataa he
 Kings XI Punjab franchise has also said that they get more profit by playing home matches in Pune or Indore instead of Mohali
 nae gharelu maidan ke liye punjab team ke maalikon kii pehali pasand indore he
 This issue was also raised in a meeting with the COA
 jiske baad samiti ne agali ipel gavarning coucil main is par charchaa karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Mohali is the home ground of Punjab team from the first season of IPL, so the team may have to pay more if they choose a new home ground
 vahiin khabaren ye bhi he ki punjab team bhi rajasthan kii tarah apana naam badalane par vichaar kar rahi he

 a court in Islamabad has sent the Mumbai attack mastermind zaki-ur-rehman Lakhvi to 14 days judicial custody
 is baar lakhvi ko jail apharan ke ek puraane maamle main darj nae mukademe main hui he
 This is the second time after getting bail in the Mumbai attack case on December 18, when the Pakistani government has managed to keep Lakhvi in jail
 pakistan kii sarkaar ko lakhvi ko jail main band rakhane ke liye itane papad belane kyon pad rahe hai
 It is obvious that behind this Mumbai attack case was spent
 18 disambar ko lakhvi ko rawalpindi kii adiyaala jail main lagane vaali aatankwaad virdohi adaalat yaa atisi ne jab jamaanat di to uskaa baahar aana lagbhag tay ho gaya tha, lekin peshawar main schuli bacchon par hamale ke baad pakistan se saath kandhe se kandhaa mila kar rone vaale bharat ne jab lakhvi kii rihaai ko bada jhatka bataaya to pakistan neend se jaagta dikhaa
 The day before, Pakistan vowed to be strict with the terrorists
 aatankwaadiyon ke maamle main faansee kii sajaa ko dobaaraa behaal karne kaa faisla liya tha
 In such a situation, the mastermind of 166 murders in Mumbai could have troubled Pakistan on the international stage
 yahi vajah he ki uski rihaai se ain pehle use mentanence of public order ke tahat phir hiraasat main le liya gaya
 Lakhvi reached the Islamabad High Court, and the High Court cleared the way for the release of Lakhvi on a bond of Rs 10 lakh by declaring the MPO unjustified
 ye ek aatankwaadi ke saamne pakistan kii sarkaar kii ek or haar thi
 Seeing no way out, the victim of a six-year-old kidnapping case against Lakhvi was brought to light
 iske maamle main darj mukademe ke tahat adaalat se lakhvi kii do din kii police remand hasil kii gai
 On Thursday, the police wanted a further five days remand, but the court sent Lakhvi to 14 days judicial custody
 lakhvi ke vakil rigwan abbasi ne aarope lagaaya ki is mukademe ko bharat ke dabaav main darj kiya gaya he
 This is a violation of the rights of his client
 court ne philhal is daleel ko nahin mana he, lekin sawaal he ki apharan ke maamle main aakhir lakhvi ko kitne dinon tak jail main rakhaa ja sakegaa
 Lakhvi will go to the upper court
 is bich pakistan kii sarkaar supreme court gai he
 He has filed an appeal against the High Court's decision which ordered the removal of MPO on Lakhvi
 daleel he ki hoicourt main sarkaar kii daleel suni nahin gai
 Sources in Pakistan reveal that the prosecution did not actually appear
 pakistan kii sarkaar kii taraf se lakhvi maamle main kotahi kaa lanbaa silsilaa he
 This includes not properly placing the evidence against Lakhvi in court
 yahaan tak ki lakhvi ke khilaaf pesh gavaahon ke saath bhi vah talmail nahin bitha paayi
 The largest example of this is the testimony of Mudassar Lakhvi, the headmaster of Okara's school
 mumbai hamale ke dauraan ekmaatr zindaa pakadaa gaya aatankwaadi ajmal aamir kasaab isi skool main padhata tha
 Mudassar told the court that Kasab is alive
 jaanch essenji ne court ko ye bharosa dilaane kii puri koshish nahin kii ki asli kasaab vahi he jo mumbai hamale main shaamil tha or jise 2012 main bharat main faansee di gai
 While Kasab's confession was taken as evidence on record in the court and Lakhvi was arrested in 2009 on the same basis
 pakistan kii taraf se kotahi kaa silsilaa yaheen nahin rukaa he
 On December 18, she could not obtain a copy of the decision to bail Lakhvi from the court till December 22, which would have become the basis of appeal against this decision in the upper court
 exe ke vakil choudhary azhar is baat kaa ronaa rote hai ki ye sab saazishan kiya gaya he
 The copy of the order was not given, but do the terrorists there operate the judicial system to stop the government agency from taking a copy of the judgment? The answer is no
 to phir jaj ne order kii copy abhiyojan paksh ko kyon nahin muhaiyyaa karai, jabaki vah rihaai ke liye jailer ke paas pahunch gaya
 Are the judges acting under any pressure? Lakhvi's bail plea had earlier been dismissed on several occasions, but this time the ground was made by Mudassar Lakhvi's statement, prolonged trial of trial and imposition of wrong sections
 vaise, ek dilachasp tathy yah bhi he ki aatankwaad virdohi adaalat ke jaj syed coras abbaas zadi shiya hai or unako kisi tarah kii koi suraksha nahin di gai he
 Before this, many judges and prosecution lawyers have abstained from the Lakhvi case, because they received threats
 islamabad hoicourt ke jaj nasir ul mulq jinhone lakhvi par lage empio ko nirast kiya, unako bhi koi suraksha nahin mili hui he
 This is the aspect of the picture that underlines the fear, pressure, fear of intimidation in a decision related to a case, but the real thing revolves around it
 pakistan ne lakhvi ke kilaaf gambhirtha nahin dikhaai
 Had he been seen, he would not have got bail
 pakistan kii sarkaar ab jo kanoonee ladaai lard rahi he, vah bas apane chehre ko bachaane kii qavaayad lag rahi he
 As lashkar-e-taiba chief and the biggest mastermind of the Mumbai attack Hafiz Saeed was released from the Lahore High Court based on lack of evidence and is now living an independent life, Lakhvi's case also seems to go in the same direction
 
 pakistan abhi bas nazaron kii thodi-si haya dikhaa rahaa he
 In fact, Lakhvi is not considered a terrorist there
 sarkaar ko is baat kaa dar bhi sataata he ki agar wo jamaat ud daawa jaise sanghathanon yaa usase jude aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf sakhti karegi to puraa punjab jal uthegaa, kyonki ye suba hi in tanjeemon kaa garh he
 And this suba plays an important role in bringing Nawaz Sharif to power
 ant main, agar ye bhi maan le ki nawaz shareef kii sarkaar lakhvi ke maamle par sanjeeda he or wo nateeja dena chaahati he to kya ye mana jaae ki lakhvi ke paksh main faisle isliye aa rahe hai taaki pakistan kii chuni hui sarkaar kii fazihat ho? lekin aisa maanane kaa matlab pakistan kii nyaay vyavastha par sawaal uthaanaa hoga, uskaa sena ke asar main kaam karne jaisaa aarope lagaana hoga, jo ki ham karnaa nahin chaahate
 Chief Minister Mayawati said that the Congress and its crown prince, who claimed to change the fate and picture of the state, should not forget that the Congress ruled the state for 40 years and during this period, the poorest and unemployed went to other states

 Rani belongs to Rajori Garden in Delhi
 papa mithai vaale hai or unke dost ke shabdon main kahen to rani bitiyaa bahut sweet he
 Absolutely soaked in sugar syrup
 magar sach ye he ki rani khud rani ke shabdon main tamaam jindagi sabaki baat maanati rahi
 Remained good or is kram main jaisaa ki zyaadaatar hota he, apana aatmavishvaas nahin samet pai kabhi is mutthi bhar akaash, jise duniya kehete hai, use langhane ke liye
 Rani falls in love with Vijay
 iske liye vijay vah saare jatan karata he, jo hamaari peedi ne siikhe hai
 Sometimes taking a heart balloon, sometimes chasing and forcibly realizing the depth of your love
 phir baari aati he rani vaids vijay moment kii
 But Vijay Babu has come to the UK now
 mordan ho gaye hai kathith rup se
 So they no longer think of their type of queen
 or wo faisla karte hai biyah se do roj pehle, na bolne kaa
 Like a mountain falls on the queen
 magar chuppi bhare aansu jab subah sookhte hai, to sabase pehle vah apni shaadi ke liye pack kiye laddu khaati he or uske baad tay karti he ki pai pai jodakar usne jo paris or amsterdam main honeymoon manaane kii planning kii he, use continu karegi
 Absolutely gross and devoid of perceived prudence, the queen also lets her mother and father go
 shaayad isse bitiyaa ke darak chuke dil ko kuch marammat mili, aisa sochakar
 When the queen arrives in Paris, after the initial tremors, she surrenders herself to a world where no support is needed to smile and laugh
 yahaan uski mulaakaat hoti he half indian kanya vijayalakshmi se
 Vijayalakshmi works in a hotel, has fun and earnestly raises her boyfriend's son
 uske saath rani khulti he, khilti he or khilakhilaati bhi he
 Here, when the queen leaves for the second stop of the journey towards Amsterdam, Vijay is seen with the deception of this new form
 phir unhen lagata he ki ilaa, ye kya kar diya maine
 He enters Devdas mode and sets out to find his queen, i will follow you, following the tune of that city
 magar rani to yahaan apane nae bane doston ke saath jindagi ke nae or jaruri myne sikh rahi he
 So does Rani come back to Rajouri and hug Vijay
 
 
 yaheen film bahut gambhirtha or saralata ke saath sandesh detii he
 Kangana Ranot has supported this film with its impeccable acting
 unhone hamen bataaya ki kyon unhen bahut bahut zyada gambhirtha se liye jane kii jarurat he
 Without any makeup, Lajpat Nagar Market Type Kurti and Jeans, the first hesitation and running queen is the journey of a woman and she has given her a happy life
 mummy papa kii kasam, fain ho gaya main is ladki kii acting kaa
 Rani's story begins in typical Delhi style
 ladki kii mehandi chal rahi he or vah phikar kar rahi he ki hai mummy ne suut bhi nahin badla
 Chintu is not even taking photos, how will i update on Facebook and Vijay has started looking smart by returning from UK
 ye tamaam chijen hamen is charitra ke sammohan main baandhti hai
 Then when she shares all the fear and thinking between her smile and tears after drinking alcohol in Paris, you fall in love with her
 aakhir main vah jab apane dam par froconuma dress sanbhale shahar kii pagadendi par bhaagti he, to saaf najar aata he ki aakhir uske asal sapanom ko par lag gaye hai
 Apart from Rani in the film, Rajkumar Rao in Vijay's role has also done a great acting and has further enhanced the romance with Shahid
 ek bhartiya balak kis tarah apane pyaar ko prabhutaa main badal detaa he, care ke naam par haaavee hota he or jab sab kuch ganvaane kii had par aata he, to kaise chirori mod main aa jaataa he, ise queen main bakhubi dikhaaya gaya he
 Apart from this, Lisa Haydon and other actors have also played their roles well
 maine upar zikr kiya ki film main virudhon kaa saamanjasy he
 On one side is the queen's grandmother, who convinces her that we are wrong when we think that it is all over
 phir jab jindagi kuch behatar ho jaati he, tab samaj aata he ki jo hua, acha hi hua
 Overall a lot of chilled out grandma despite being in Delhi
 or ek paris main rahane vaali dhingra ankal kii family he, jisaki mahilaayein rani ko dekhakar aise marsia padhati hai, goyaa rani kii shaadi na tut gai, jindagi kii ladi hi hameshaa ke liye bikhar gai
 On one side are Vijay's mummies, for whom the queen returned from Paris is an open letter, which is just enough that when the son and father leave the office, they will drink tea together
 gapp ladaayengi or kiti karengi
 On the other side is Vijayalakshmi, who is busy in living her life, pushing aside any gilt
 rani jab apni virginity ke boj ko bisar lip tu lip kis karti he, to vah bhi tamaam aparaadh bodh ko unmukt dhang se visarjeet kar detii najar aati he
 In the same way, when she finally embraces Vijay, there is no sense of revenge in her
 yah ek kism kaa rishiyon vaala bhav he, jisamen sab kuch jaanakar bhi nishchal bane rahane kii pavitra jid haaavee rahati he
 Director Vikas Bahl did not leave any shortcoming in the storyline
 film kii length dekhakar ekbargi lagata he ki kahin kahin plot ko jabaran kai siron main failaayaa gaya hoga
 But this does not happen
 raftaar or ghumaav lagaataar bane rahete hai
 Yes, by telling the story of some foreign characters, the attempt to provide for the suffering and salvation of the queen could have been avoided
 amit trivedi kaa mujeec lagaataar dev di kii yaad dilaataa he
 Whether it is Baja Ranjha during the disconnection of the queen or finally 'baja Mille Gaye' during her rise, all prove to be helpful in increasing the intensity of the story
 film 'queen' jarur dekhie
 It says that if i applied with my lips, there was an uproar, the woman singing the song did not necessarily move towards the path of suicide in the name of freedom
 ye film aapako behatar insaan banane main madad karegi
 Without any lecture
 is kahani kii kai paraten or har parat ek baarik nigaah kii maang karti he
 One of the best films of this year will be Miss Marak

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has disagreed over the decision of the Central Government to present the railway budget with the general budget
 purv rail mantri rah chuke nitish kumaar ne kaha ki main apane anubhav ke aadhaar par kah saktaa hum ki isse laabh nahin hone vaala he or railway kii jo swaittata rahi he wo samaapt ho jaaegi
 Everything will run like other departments
 'rail bajet ko lekar hota tha utsaah'nitish kumaar ne kaha ki logon ko jaankaree nahin he ki hamaare jitne bhi saansad he, unki ruchi rail bajet main aam bajet se zyada hoti he
 It is politically pleasing for mps to participate in the Rail Budget debate or take credit for expanding or benefiting the railways directly to the people of their region
 yahi vajah he ki aam bajet se zyada saansad rail bajet kii bahes main hissaa lete hai
 Sometimes the debate on the railway budget goes on overnight
 rail bajet ko hoga nuksaanam janata kaa bhi rail ke prati bahut aakarshan rahata he
 In view of the expectations of the common people from the railways, the railway budget was kept for the good functioning of the railway
 lekin ab aisa lagata he ki railway centre sarkaar kii praathamikta main shaamil nahin hogi, tabhi to aisa nirnay liya gaya
 Nitish Kumar then asked to consider this decision
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki railway kaa bajet jaise pehle hota tha vaisaa hi hona chahie
 There is not going to be any benefit from presenting it with a general budget
 railway main centre sarkaar jitna paisa lagaati he, uskaa divident railway adaa karti he
 The railway committee used to decide how much dividend to pay
 isamen koi nuksaan nahin tha
 Along with the support of the Center on the issue of terror, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has supported the Center in the fight against terrorism

 Nitish Kumar says that all of them know that terrorism in India is the product of Pakistan and that Pakistan has its hand behind any recent terrorist attacks
 'lead centre ko hi karnaa he'nitish kumaar ne kaha aatankwaad ek aisa maamla he, jisamen puure desh main ekajutata honi chahie
 These allegations are not the subject of counter-allegations
 kaise ghuspaith hui, kahaan gadabadi hui ye sab vishay nahin hai
 This is a question that should be mutually agreed upon
 isliye aise masalon par centre sarkaar jo bhi karrwai kare, usamen ham log unke saath hai
 He said that whatever attitude the central government has to take, they should do it to take this situation
 ham sab kaa sahyog or samarthan he
 But the central government has to take the lead

 Something similar is with Team India's off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin
 bhale hi vah lagaataar safaltaaen arjeet kar rahe hai or isisi ne unhen saal ko best test cricketer ghoshit kiya he, lekin is bich bharat ke mahaan spinner rahe irapalli prasanna ne unki kuch kamajoriyon kii ore dhyaan khinchate hue ahm salaah di hai
 However Prasanna named Ravichandran Ashwin as the best spinner in the world at present
 aaie jaanate hai ki prasanna ne aswin ko kya salaah di
 
 
 According to Prasanna, off-spinner Ashwin needs to give the ball more flight
 england ke khilaaf chaar test maichon kii siries main 28 wicket lene or 304 ran jodne vaale aswin ko lekar prasanna ne pitiai se kaha, ‘‘isamen koi shaq nahin ki hamaare paas aswin ke rup main sarvshereshth mukhya gendbaaj he
 He is the best spinner in the world right now, but he often needs to give the ball a flight
 ’’ The 76-year-old great spinner said, "unless he inspires the batsmen to come out and play, it will be a bit difficult for him
" uske dimag main uske paas ek leg brake gend he jise vah sochataa he ki kaaphi prabhavi he
 "but Prasanna said," But seeing him, the batsman will easily know how he wants to bowl in that ball
 uske ection se aap aasaani se bataa sakate ho ki vah agali gend koun si daalega
 '' prasanna ne rabindra jadeja kii bhi prashansa kii
 He said, "we also need to give credit for our success to Ravindra Jadeja, because he kept a tight end against England
 in donon ne england ke khilaaf siries jeet main kaaphi zyada yogadan diya
 '' Comments gend ko flite karne ke maharathi prasanna ne kaha, ‘‘ab jadeja us daur main pahunch chukaa he jahaan vah ballebaaj kaa dimag pard saktaa he or mukhya gendbaaj ke taur par match vijeta ban saktaa he
 '' prasanna ne yuva olerounder jayant yadav kii spin gendbaaji ke bare main kaha, ‘‘agar aap mujhase poochhoge to mujhe nahin lagata ki jayant yadav lambey spel phenk paaegaa
 He is a useful batsman for T20 and ODI matches and can bowl a good four overs in both these formats
 usne khel ke lambey praaroop main sabit kar diya he ki vah strike gendbaaj nahin he
 '' prasanna ke anusaar of spinner aswin ko gend ko or adhik flite dene kii jarurat he
 Regarding Ashwin, who took 28 wickets and added 304 runs in the four-test series against England, Prasanna told PTI, "there is no doubt that we have the best lead bowler as Ashwin
" vah abhi duniya kaa sarvshereshth spinner he, lekin unako aksar gend ko flite dene kii jarurat he
 '' is 76 varshiya mahaan spinner ne kaha, ‘‘jab tak vah ballebaajon ko baahar aakar khilne ke liye prerit nahin karegaa, uske liye thodi mushkil hogi
 In his mind he has a leg break ball which he thinks is quite effective
 ’’ prasanna ne kaha, ‘‘lekin use dekhakar, ballebaaj aasaani se jaan jayega ki vah us gend main vah kisi gendbaaji karnaa chahta he
 With his action, you can easily tell which ball he will bowl next
 ’’ Prasanna also praised Ravindra Jadeja
 unhone kaha, ‘‘hamen apni safalataa kaa shrey rabindra jadeja ko bhi dene jarurat he, kyonki usne england ke khilaaf ek chor par lagaam kase rakhi
 Both of them contributed much to the series win against England
 ’’ tippaniyan Maharathi Prasanna of flying the ball said, "now Jadeja has reached that stage where he can read the mind of the batsman and become the match winner as the main bowler
" ’’ Prasanna said of young all-rounder Jayant Yadav's spin bowling, "if you ask me, i don't think Jayant Yadav will be able to throw long spells
" vah tii-20 or vanade maichon ke liye upyogi ballebaaj he or vah in donon praroopon main achche chaar over phenk saktaa he
 He has proved in the longer format of the game that he is not a strike bowler
 ’’ Prasanna also praised Ravindra Jadeja

 ’’ China on Thursday stressed that there is no such thing as the Tibetan question, as the Dalai Lama has been saying
 saath hi usne kaha ki vah koi bahari hastkshep ko sweekaar nahin karegaa kyonki vah himalayan kshetra se jude har mudde ko apana aantarik maamla maanata he
 Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu said this in a media briefing in response to a question about the incidents of self-immolation made by several Buddhist monks, including a nun, in protest against Chinese rule in Tibet
 pravaktaa ne aba county kii kirti math kaa ullekh karte hue kaha yah maamla (nan kaa aatmadah) tibet ke bajaay sichuaan praant main hua

 He said, 'the truth is that Modi himself sent a message through Ajay Shikre to the Pune franchise to contact Amin and ask him to be a part of the group
 ’manohar ne kaha ki jab boli lagane vaale amin se samooh se judane ke liye mili to amin boli jeetne kii sthiti main das pratishat nivesh karne ke liye taiyaar ho gayi or unhe bisisiai kii anumati bhi mil gayi
 Amin gave me the letter and gave a copy of it to the honorary secretary (N
 Srinivasan), who was told that the Pune franchise had met him
 unhone kaha ki patr main saaf kaha gaya he ki city karporation jab boli jitegaa to cricket board se aupchaarik rup se baat karegaa ki is samooh main puunji lagane kii anumati di jaae
 It is clear from the letter that the proposal was with the condition that Amin would take the board's permission only when the bid is successful
 manohar ne modi par aarope lagaaya ki vah amin or board kii chhavi ko kharaab karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Modi said, 'modi has been trying to tarnish the image of the board and Viva Amin by making various statements since yesterday
 ye bayaan sachai se kaaphi dur hai
 'therefore, it is clear that Modi's claim that Amin was part of the bid is completely wrong, it is only to malign and defame the image of the board
 pune frenchiji par lagi boli sahaara group ne hasil kii thi, lekin is boli ne bada vivaad khadaa kar diya tha kyonki isamen bisisiai ke purv pramukh or krishi mantri sharad pavaar or unki saansad beti supriya sule shaamil hone kii baat kahi ja rahi thi
 Pawar's family had 16 per cent equity in 'city Corporation', but claimed that Deshpande had bid alone for the Pune team and the company's board was against the move, although he used the company's name in the bid documents
 Was allowed
 lekin manohar ne kaha ki ipel kii sanchaalan parishad jaanati thi ki deshpandey akele boli laga rahe the, lekin is boli ko ek sire se khaarij kar diya gaya
 Manohar said, "modi had made a statement that Deshpande had informed him that even though the bid would be made on behalf of City Corporation Ltd
, it was really his personal bid
 ’manohar ne kaha, ‘modi khud vivaadon main fanse hai or vah baar baar is tarah ke galat or bebuniyaad bayaan dekar board kii chhavi kharaab karne kii koshish kar rahe hai jabaki board unke galat kaamon kii vajah se aisi sharmnaak sthiti main pahunchaa he

 Encouraged by the order of the Jharkhand High Court, the Election Commission has said that it will write a letter to the government seeking a CBI inquiry into the allegations of use of money power in the Rajya Sabha elections in Jharkhand last week
 rajyasabha chunaav ko radd kiye jane ke faisle ke khilaaf congress pratyaashee pradeep kumaar balmuchu kii yachika ko adaalat ne khaarij kar diya
 With this, the way of holding fresh elections in the state was cleared
 mukhya chunaav ayukta esavai kurashine kaha, ‘yah bhrashtachar ke khilaaf safalataa he
 We feel stronger than the High Court verdict
 ham is maamle main ab sibiai jaanch kii maang karenge
 He said, "we are happy that the High Court supported our stand and this is a step to discourage wrongdoing
" ab hamen ucch nyaayalay se manjuuri bhi mili he
 We will request the Ministry of Home Affairs to conduct a CBI inquiry
 ’adaalat ne congress pratyaashee pradeep kumaar balmuchu kii rajyasabha chunaav radd karne ke chunaav ayog ke faisle ko chunauti dene vaali rit yachika ko guuruuvaar ko khaarij kar diya
 But at the same time, the court directed to investigate the complaints of horse trading in the elections from the expert agency
 jharkhand ucch nyaayalay kii mukhya nyaayadhish prakaash chandra tontia or nyaayamurti aparesh kumaar singh kii khandpeeth ne yah aadesh diye
 The bench rejected Balmuchu's writ petition filed on Tuesday seeking to quash the decision of the Election Commission
 isse purv jharkhand main pichley saptaah rajyasabha chunaavon ko radd kiye jane ke chunaav ayog ke faisle ke khilaaf congress pratyaashee or party ke pradesh adhyaksh pradeep kumaar balmuchu ne mangalvaar ko jharkhand ucch nyaayalay main rit yachika daayar kar ayog ke faisle ko khaarij kiye jane kii maang kii thi
 By filing a writ petition before the Jharkhand High Court, Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu had on 30 March termed the Central Election Commission's decision to cancel the elections for the two Rajya Sabha seats in the state unconstitutional and requested the court to stop it
 
 yachika ko janhit yachika ke rup main sweekaar karne kaa anurodh karte hue balmuchu ne tark diya tha ki rajyasabha chunaavon ko radd kiye jane ke liye chunaav ayog ke paas kam se kam koi shikaayat to aani chahie thi
 Balmuchu said that cash, arms and ammunition are caught in all the elections from the general elections held in the country and this has happened many times, but the elections have never been canceled on this basis
 adhik se adhik sabhi maamalon main punarmatdaan karaaye jate hai
 Balmuchu argued why the Election Commission had shown so much interest in canceling the Rajya Sabha elections this time
 yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki chunaav prakriya ko radd karnaa chunaav ayog ke adhikaar kshetra main nahin aata he
 In this regard, Balmuchu said that he respects the decision of the court, but the way to the Supreme Court is open for him, which he is considering

 The move has also been opposed by the government employees of Jammu and Kashmir
 unki emplayi joint ection kamity (ejac)ne kaha he ki ye totli anjastyphid kadam he or sarkari karmchaariyon par bada boj he, khaskar non gajeted cader ke liye
 They have described it as 'unfamiliar, unjustified and unexceptable'

 He said, "I don't think Mayawati, Akhilesh or TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu will go with BJP

 mayawati or mamata pehle hi chunaav ayog par sawaal uthaa chuki hai

 On this, DUSU president Shakti Singh says that he had demanded many times from DU administration to install the idol, but it was unheard

 The move comes after a research report published in Japan stated that photographs of cute animals such as puppies or kittens could improve concentration levels
 is kaksh ko sthapit karne kaa lakshya charity ke liye dhan ekatra karnaa bhi he
 1 from students to come to the room
 50 pound (lagbhag 144

 Since this FIR has been done by CBI, it cannot be questioned too much because CBI registers FIR only after investigation

 He was accompanied by his elder brother and minister Tej Pratap Yadav

 During the uproar, Durga Murugan tried to tear Jayalalitha's clothes
 karunanidhi kaa chashma tut gaya
 Angry legislators tore even the budget copy
 3- 22 oktober 1997, upi vidhansabha janata ke jehan main wo kaala din aaj bhi darj he, jab upi vidhansabha akhaade main tabdeel ho gai thi
 The opportunity was of Kalyan Singh's vote of confidence

 The Delhi bjp's review meeting was held after a bitter defeat in the assembly elections
 dilli bijepi ke netaaon kaa maananaa he ki kamjor ranneeti ke kaaran party ko shamarnak haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Apart from this, making Kiran Bedi the bjp's CM candidate and ignoring the local activists of Delhi and giving full command of the campaign to the outside leaders, were the main reasons for the defeat
 RSS ne 3 mantriyon kii lagaai 'class'dilli bijepi ke headquarter main shuukravaar ko hui baithak main bijepi netaaon ne kaha ki in kaarnon se sthaneey netritv kii urja main baari kami ai jisane party ko bahut bada nuksaan pahunchaaya
 Most leaders also believed that the delay in announcing the names of the candidates also went against the party
 bijepi ummidavaaron ko AAP kii tulana main chunaav prachaar kaa kam samay mila
 The resentment in the local leadership of the party can also be gauged from the fact that only 21 of the 36 people called from this meeting participated
 party kii siem candidet kiran bedi bhi is meeting main nahin pahunchin
 Various speculations are being made about this
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa ne mail today akhbaar se kaha ki party ne dow
 More than Harshvardhan, he believed in an 'outsider'
 bedi ko siem candidet bananaa mahangaa sabit hua
 More activists were against this decision
 kuch netaaon ko maananaa he ki agar bedi ko laana hi tha to unhen kejariwal ke khilaaf utaarna chahie tha
 Some leaders of Delhi BJP have blamed the central leadership for this defeat

 On this occasion, the Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan gave the message of peace in the program and said that it is madness to think of war between the two countries
 hamaare donon ke paas atomi hathiyaar hai, to inke bich jang ho hi nahin sakati
 Imran Khan said that when i came in politics, i met such people who used to work only for themselves, they forgot the people
 ek duusare kism kaa rajaneta he to nafaraton ke naam par nahin balki kaam ke naam par raajnneeti karata tha
 He said that this is happening for 70 years now where pakistan-india are standing
 donon taraf galtiyaan huin lekin ham jab tak aage nahin badhenge, zanjeer nahin tuutegi
 Imran Khan further said that we go one step ahead and move back two steps
 hamamen ye takat nahin ai he ki kuch bhi ho ham rishte thik karenge
 If France and Germany can come together, then why can't Pakistan and Hindustan do the same

 agar hindustan ek kadam aage badhayega to ham do kadam aage badhayenge
 Speaking on Siddhu, Imran Khan said that when Sidhu went back the last time, he got a lot of criticism, but what is the crime of a person who has brought the message of peace
 hamaare donon ke paas atomi hathiyaar hai, to inke bich jang ho hi nahin sakati he
 To think of war between the two countries is insane
 phir agar jang nahin kar sakate to jo kar sakate hai wo karen
 Talk about peace
 agar siddhu pakistan main chunaav lard len to wo jeet sakate hai
 We do not have to wait for Sidhu to become Prime Minister

 ab sirf piem modi ke paas hogi espiji surakshajankaree ke mutabik ab gandhi parivaar kii suraksha main Z+ shrenee kii hogi or CRPF ke commando suraksha duty main tainaat honge
 This important decision has been taken at a high level meeting of the Ministry of Home Affairs
 iskaa matlab he ki ab espiji kii suraksha sirf piem modi ke paas hi rahegi
 Because before this, the security of SPG was with only four people, including the names of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi along with PM Modi
 is vajah se liya gaya faislabataya ja rahaa he kiyah nirnay sabhi suraksha agenciyon se mili inputs ke aadhaar par liya gaya he
 According to sources, there was no threat or apprehension of any attack on the Gandhi family in the recent past, that is why the decision was taken by the government to reduce security
 iske alaava gandhi parivaar se espiji suraksha hataane kaa ek pramukh aadhaar or bhi tha
 According to sources, more than 30 visits from the Gandhi family were not being properly shared with the SPG
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ye yatraaen pichley paanch saal ke dauraan hui thim
 No untoward incident was also reported to SPG during this visit
 iske alaava anya tathyon ke aadhaar par banaai gai report kaa aalaa adhikariyon ke saamne zikr hua jiske baad yah faisla liya gaya
 Earlier, the security of Manmohan Singh was removed
 The security arrangements of all the former Prime Ministers are reviewed from time to time and more or less based on that, if needed
 isse pehle purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii suraksha se bhi SPG cover hataakar CRPF kii Z+ category kii suraksha di gai thi
 This is how SPG surakshaspg is a highly trained unit and is equipped with all modern equipment, vehicles

 Former India opener Gautam Gambhir has sparked a new debate in the tempering controversy that has caused a stir in Australia cricket
 gambhir ne sawaal kiya he ki kya cricket australia ne steve smith or david warner ko board ke khilaaf khadey hone kii sajaa di he?smith or warner ko sajeesh karke capatoun main dakshin africa ke khilaaf tisare test main ball tempring karne par ek-ek saal ke liye team se baahar nikaal diya gaya he
 Third and young player Cameron Bencroft, who was found involved in the case, has been banned for 9 months
 purv australian cricketer shen worne ne bhi kaha he ki smith or warner ko kaaphi kadi sajaa di gai he
 In this case, the ICC also acted on the Australian players and Smith was suspended for one match and fined the entire fee for that match
 bencroft par match fees kaa 75 fisadi fine lagaaya gaya tha
 Now Gambhir termed the sentence as 'tough' and raised the question whether both of them have had to bear the brunt of rebelling against Cricket Australia in the matter of increasing salary? Gambhir, captain of the Delhi Daredevils in the IPL, believes that these two players have been punished for being pioneers in the controversy over the salary increase of the senior team
 rohit sharma ne bhismith se sahanubhuti jatihe
 Gambhir wrote on his official Twitter account, 'cricket needs to be corruption free but it seems that the restrictions against Australian players are somewhat stringent
 kya steve smith or david warner ko vetan badhaane ke maamle main baghawat kaa khamiyaja bhugatna pad rahaa he? itihaas gavaah he ki khilaadiyon ke hiton ke liye khadey rahane waalon kaa prashaasak majaak banaate hai
 An example of this is Ian Chappell
 'while cricket needs to be corruption-free but feel sanctions on Aussies bit harsh
