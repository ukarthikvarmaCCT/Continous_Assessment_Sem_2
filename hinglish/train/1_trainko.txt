 After a bitter defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress, which is trying to increase its base in UP, has focused on its old Dalit vote bank

 In the 125th birth anniversary year of Bhimrao Ambedkar, the Congress is trying to prove itself friendly to the Dalits through Bhima Jyoti visits, panchayats and dialogues

 By focusing on the incidents of Dalit atrocities, the Congress is exposing the SP and BSP among the Dalits

 There is nothing new in this, except that this picture is from a remote region of Haryana where only men rule

 The young woman to address them is Anita Kundu who comes from a landless middle class family of Uklana in Hisar
 unhone may, 2012 main mount everest par fatah hasil kii thi jisaki evaj main haryana police main unhen sab-inspector kii naukari mil gai
 Kundu was accompanied by Captain Mahavir Lohan, representative of 44 villages and head of the extremely powerful Khap Satrol
 ve khud kanya bhrunahatya or parivaar kii izzat bachaane ke naam par kii jane vaali hatya ke mukhar virdohi hai
 On that day, young and old members of Naugama Khap (of nine villages) were also present in this wonderful lady Chaupal of her type in Bibipur
 jaise-jaise or mahilaayein aati ja rahi thim, ve unke liye apni kursi chhodte ja rahe the
 What is happening in Bibipur in the heart of Haryana, notorious for khap panchayats, is a possible sign of a major social change that could lead to prudent khap panchayats in the coming times
 isaki shuruyaat 14 july, 2012 ko hui thi jab bibipur ke yuva sarpanch or do betiyon ke pita 32 varshiya sunil jagalan ne haryana, rajasthan, pashchimi uttar pradesh or dilli kii 112 khaapon kii ek mahapanchayat bulaai thi or kanya bhrunahatya ke khilaaf mrityudand kii maang karte hue sanyukt sankalp ko apnaane ke liye inhen prerit kiya tha
 Recalling the "uneasyness" caused to the elders, Sirt Ritu, 29, the sarpanch's sister, says, "the task was not easy
 inhen is baat kii aadat hi nahin thi ki auraten inke bich main bolen
 When i got up to speak, it became a matter of discussion
 ''jald hi yah asahajata khatm hone lagi
 Jaglan recalls that day, "for the first time women participated without any bond and questioned top leaders without fear
 '' ek-se-ek akkhad pradhanon ne unke saamne hathiyaar daal die
 The law had long ago banned sex-testing, but after so many years, finally all the Khap elders could agree that female feticide should be treated as murder
 jagalan bataate hai ki uttar bharat main jat samudaay ke bheetar ladkaa paane kii barason puraani chahat ke khilaaf ek sankalp ke liye khap netaaon kaa raji ho janaa darasal is jaagrukta or badhati chintaa kaa nateeja tha ki praudhon main linganupaat khatarnaak str par pahunch gaya he or bahut se gaanvon se janm ke samay linganupaat kii ghatati dar ke saath ashanka he ki yah or buree sthiti main pahunch jayega
 For example, according to the 2011 census in Haryana, the average state-wise sex ratio is 879 females per 1,000 males
 lekin gaanvon se jo khabar aa rahi he, vah isse kahin adhik bhayaavah he
 The data available with the state health department exposes this frightening truth and this is the reason why Prime Minister Narendra Modi started his "beti Bachao, Beti Padhao" campaign from Haryana on 24 January when he made it clear to the people here Said that they should not "kill daughters"
 ''rajya ke kul 7,363 gaanvon main se 3,974 yani aadhe se zyada gaanvon main 2013 main janm ke samay (0 se ek saal) linganupaat 500 se neeche paaya gaya tha
 These include Mejat's Gajarpur, Jind's Kharal, Kaithal's Bopur and Panchkula's Suri village where the ratio was dangerously low, ie 76 to 143 females per 1,000 males
 iske alaava kareeb 2,400 gaanv or kuch choti rihaaishein aisi bhi hai jahaan se 2013 main kisi bhi ladki ke janm kii khabar hi nahin ai
 Ramnivas, Haryana's additional chief secretary and in-charge of the health department, points out that the constantly declining sex ratio represents a stark truth and cannot be ignored
 ve kehete hai, ''yah sach he ki zyada se zyada ladakiyon ko garbh main hi maar diya ja rahaa he
 "they warn that the situation is very fragile and over time it may cause" the downfall of Haryana's rural society "
 ram nivas aise tamaam yuvakon ke bare main bataate hai jinhen shaadi ke liye ladkiyaan nahin mil rahi hai or aisa takreeban har gaanv main he
 Young members of Naugama and Saratol Khap point out that the crisis of girls born due to the practice of female feticide also increases because most Khap panchayats enforce the law of gotra
 unke mutabik ladakon kii tarah ladakiyon ko bhi paitruk sampatti main samaan hissaa dene sambandhi hindu uttaradhikaar kanoon main 2005 main kiye gaye aitihaasik sanshodhan ne ladakon kii chahat ko or badhaane kaa hi kaam kiya he

 inkaa iklauta uddeshy yahi hota he ki zyada se zyada paramparawaadi bujurgon ko shaadiyon ke maamle main lagi bandishen dhili karne ke liye taiyaar kiya ja sake
 After motivating some more youth due to the same problem, on April 20 last year, Satrol Khap unleashed a 650-year-old tradition in one voice
 sadiyon main pehali baar khap netaaon ne ghoshnaa kii ki ve duusare gaanvon or duusari jatiyon main shaadiyon kaa samarthan karenge
 Jaglan, who was included as a special invitee in the Satrol Panchayat held in Hisar, considers the decision as "historic and revolutionary"

 According to Lohan, now for every inter-caste wedding that took place in his area, the khap was Rs 21,000

 Putting an end to the long-standing criticisms, now Khap panchayats have started encouraging women to actively participate and speak in their meetings

 Just a few weeks after Satarol Khap's transformational announcement last April, Bhiwani's most dominated Sangwan Khap also announced that it would recognize inter-caste and inter-religious marriages

 - input bhashaa se Date 19 December 2010, Vasant Kunj Police Station, Delhi, Time 8:39 AM
 nite shift puri kar zyaadaatar pulisavaale apane ghar ja chuke the
 The duty officer of the morning had just stared at the daily journal that immediately the telephone bell rang
 phone vasant kunj ilaake ke hi pocket number si-9 se tha or telephone karne vaale shaks ne bataaya ki kaafii koshishon ke baavjood uske chachaa daravaaza nahin khol rahe
 However, after peeping through the window, he is seen sleeping on his bed, and since it is long enough to knock him and call his uncle, he is afraid of something untoward
 chunki telephone karanevaale kii awaz main ghabrahat thi or maamla ek posh ilaake kaa tha, police ne bhi der nahin kii
 Immediately an IO from the police station left for the spot with the police force
 telephone karne vaala shaks vahiin maujuud tha
 The caller told that his name is Pankaj Joshi and this house is his uncle D
 ke
 Belongs to Joshi
 lekin pataa nahin kyon wo na to darwaja khol rahe hai or naa hi koi awaz hi de rahe hai
 Since the Sadar Darwaza of the house is locked from inside, no one can go inside
 alabatta drawing room main bane jharokhe se andar kaa manzar saaf dikh rahaa he
 But the police arrived on the spot are surprised when they see that Sadar Darwaza is closed from inside, but the back door is open on the outside
 ab police bina vakt ganvaae isi daravaaje se andar daakhil hoti he
 But the scene here is very creepy

 joshi kaa galaa dhardaar hathiyaar se reta hua he or isi gale main kisi ne kanchi ghused di he
 Obviously someone has murdered Joshi
 police ghar kii talaashi leti he or use pataa chalata he ki joshi kaa mobile phone, credit card, laptaap or ghar main rakhin keemtee sharaab kii bottlen gaayab he
 The police reached the crime scene and picked up finger prints and other important things to collect clues, but still it was necessary to find out one thing to reach the murderer and what was the motive of killing the murderer
 gaayab saamaanon se ek taraf to maamla lut kaa lagata he, lekin qatl ke tareeqe se ranjish kaa
 The police remain entangled for some time regarding the motive of the incident
 lekin tabhi police kaa maathaa chakra jaataa he, jab wo mauka-e-vaardaat par ek ladies wig dekhati he
 Since Joshi lives alone here, the presence of this ladies' wig is enough to prove that this wig may have some connection with Joshi's murder
 lekin chunki ek bejaan baalo ke guchchhe se koi poochtacha nahin ho sakati, police phir se tafteesh main apana sir khapaana shuru kar detii he
 First of all, the police interrogates his nephew Pankaj Joshi present on the spot
 pankaj bataata he ki unke chachaa apane is makaan main kaafii samay se akele hi rahete hai
 The only son is settled in New Jersey, USA
 haa, itnaa zarur he ki kuch samay pehle joshi ke makaan main kuch ladke peing guest ke taur par zarur rahete the, lekin ab unhen bhi chachaa kaa ghar chode hue kai din guzar chuke hai
 The case was about blind murder
 garaj ye ki police ko maranevaale kii pahchaan ke alaava kuch bhi pataa nahin tha
 Things were confusing
 police ke paas naa to qaatilon kaa koi suraag tha or naa hi chashmadid
 Since Joshi's only heir was also abroad, it was not right to look at the matter with the property
 aise main police tafteesh ke ravaayati raste par chalane kaa faisalaa karti he
 That is, she tries to get the maximum information about Joshi by inquiring most of the people, servants and relatives of Maktool
 isi silsile main police ko pataa chalata he ki chunki sarkari skool main teacher rahe joshi kaa betaa videsh main seteld he or unki bivi kaa intkaal ho chukaa he, wo kaafii dino se yahaan akele hi rahete hai
 People who know him tell that Joshi was once a very happy and sociable person, but after the death of his wife, he imprisoned himself in a way
 haa, apni zindagi kaa khalipan dur karne ve aksar dilli se sate murathal ke osho ashram main zarur jaaya karte the
 Although Joshi had no shortage of money, it was probably his loneliness, to avoid this, he had kept two school-going boys as paying guests in his house
 ye joshi kii dariyaadilii hi thi ki unhone ladakon ko padhaanaa bhi shuru kar diya tha or padhai se dhyaan naa bhatke isliye apane ghar kaa cabel conection tak katwa diya tha
 But along with these things of Joshi's personality, a question also arose that if Joshi really cared about the boys who were paying guests here, then why did he suddenly leave Joshi's house? Did his studies complete and or was there more reason
 tafteesh aage badi or ab police ko ek aisi baat kaa pataa chalaa ki use is blind murder ke ghupp andhere main ek roshni si nazar aane lagi
 In the initial phase of the investigation, the circumstances were denying the theory of old rivalry, but it was only during questioning that the suspicion of the police was going to deepen on the paying guest boys
 ab police kaa dhyaan joshi ke makaan main peing guest rah chuke ladakon kii taraf gaya or jaisaa ki amuman hota he police ne foran donon kii talash shuru kar di
 The two did not meet, but the police picked up 17-year-old Satbir from Gurgaon adjoining Delhi
 satvir apane ek dost ke saath joshi ke makaan main peing guest ke taur par rah chukaa tha
 It is clear that the needle of suspicion of the police was on Satbir and his friend
 isaki ek ahm vajah ye bhi thi isi saal march ke maheene main joshi kaa makaan khaali karte vakt donon ne unhen koi vakt nahin diya, balki ek rose achaanak hi bangalore jane kii baat kehete hue unka makaan chhod diya tha
 Moreover, both of them were in hurry to go to Bangalore so much that they left some of their belongings at Joshi's house, which remained so for so many months
 lekin is shaq kaa hal nikaalane ke liye satbir se poochtacha zaruri thi
 So, intersogation began and soon the whole story was cleared
 satbir ne kubul liya ki usee ne apane dost vikrant ke saath mil kar 17 disambar kii raat ko joshi kaa qatl kiya tha
 But the question was that Joshi, who gave him a roof to live in Delhi and who scissored his many desires for his studies, why did Satveer and his friend finally kill the same Joshi? And that too in such a savage way! The question was that if he really had any problem with Joshi, then why did he steal his laptop and other valuables after killing Joshi? If the matter was about the rivalry, then why did Satveer wait for the entire nine months to get the retaliation? Of course, without knowing the answers to these questions, the police investigation could not be completed
 police ko jab satbir kii baton par yakeen ho gaya, to usne foran use pakadaney kii kaagazi karrwai bhi puri kar lee
 But he was still under 18 years of age, so uniforms could not treat him the way he usually does with other murderers
 satbir se poochtacha shuru hui or jaise-jaise wo munh kholta gaya, ek kaufanaak qatl kii rongte khadey karanevaali saazish benakaab hoti gai
 Actually, Satbir and his friend Vikrant once stole himself in Joshi's house while staying as a paying guest
 or to or donon ne joshi kaa credit card chura kar lakhon rupye kii shopping bhi kar lee thi
 But this thing could not be hidden from Joshi
 joshi kaa gussa hona lazimi tha
 Now Joshi complained to both the families and told them the only way to save them from handing over to the police was to compensate for their loss
 satbir or vikrant ke gharavaale ab karte bhi to kya karte? ek taraf bacchon kii zindagi or izzat thi or duusari taraf daulat
 They chose the lives of the children and started making up for Joshi's loss
 satbir ke gharavaalon se jo sauda tay hua uske mutabik unhen joshi ko puure saadhe teen lakh rupye lautaane the
 The family did not delay and put more than half the amount i
e
 three lakh rupees in Joshi's hands
 lekin 50 hazaar rupye abhi bhi baaki the
 Only after this theft incident did Joshi's relationship with both boys deteriorate and both left their house as well
 lekin joshi aksar apane baaki ke 50 hazaar rupayon ke liye satbir ke gharavaalon par dabaav banaate rahe
 Satbir started to go through all this exasperation and one day he made a terrible decision to kill Joshi
 maheenon se badale kii aag main jal rahaa satbir ab har haal main joshi kii maut chahta tha
 But he was afraid that his friend Vikrant might not flop his plan
 lihaaza, 17 disambar kii dopaher jab wo joshi ke qatl ke iraade se gudgaanv se chalaa, tab usne vikrant kii bajaay apane ek or puraane dost ko saath le liya
 The secret did not open, so he did not express his intentions to this friend
 ab satbir sabase pehle kalkaji main apni garlfriend kii beauty parlor main pahunchaa or vahaan se ek ladies wig maang lee
 The intention was to hide the identity
 phir donon ek hi bike se aage ravaanaa hue
 It was night and both were standing in front of the same house in Vasantkunj, where both used to stay as a paying guest till few months back
 dost ko baahar khadaa rakh kar wo joshi se milane kii baat kah kar kothi ke andar chalaa gaya
 Now he was wearing a wig on his head so that no one suspected him of being a boy
 usne kol bel bajaai or baton main ulajhaa kar makaan main daakhil ho gaya
 Now that person was in front of Satbir, from whom the fire of revenge took away the sleep of his nights and the rest of the day
 usne sabase pehle apane dil kii baat kahi or isse pehle ki joshi sanbhal pate, usne chipa kar laai gai ek khukhri puri takat se joshi ke sir par de maari
 Due to this sudden attack Joshi fainted and rolled on the floor
 satbir ko dar tha ki kahin joshi phir se khadaa naa ho jaae, lihaaza usne paas hi rakhi ek kanchi joshi ke gale main ghused di or ise tab tak thaamen rakhaa jab tak chatapata kar joshi thande nahin ho gaye
 Now it was time to get out of here
 police ko us par shaq naa ho, isliye usne maamle ko lut kaa jama pahanaaya or laptop or sharaab kii bottle samet kai keemtee chijen uthaa kar pichley darvaaze se baahar nikal aayaa
 But despite all this, he did not tell his friend anything
 bas lautaa or dost ke saamne apana kuch saamaan waapas lene kaa naatak karte hue vahaan se ravaanaa ho gaya
 Yes, his wig was definitely missed on the occasion

 The very next year, the matter of love proved to be true
 media reporton ke mutabik bharat main janme or ferefaques financial holding ke siio prem ne 2008 kii mandi ke dastak dene se pehle hi stock market se apni company ke 16 arab dollar nikaal liye or unhen nagdi tathaa surakshit samajhe jane vaale tregeri bonds ke rup main sambhalakar rakh liya
 Siddharth says that Prem said in a confident tone, "something is wrong
" ” prem ke 15 saal puraane dost siddharth ne unki tarif karte hue kaha, ''2008 main ferefaques canada main sabase zyada munafa kamaane vaali company thi kyonki prem pukhta dhang se bazaar kii nabj ko pakadte hai
 "prem could have been in the public eye even five years ago, but today the same question is floating in everyone's eyes whether the smartphone maker blackberry Limited, which is facing all-round problems, 4
 7 arab dollar main kharidne kaa unka kadam samajhadaari bharaa he? udyog jagat ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki yah jokhim bharaa ho saktaa he
 Called Warren Buffett of Canada, Prem invests very thoughtfully
 jaankaron ke is andeh kii vajah vaazib he kyonki blueberi ko itnaa aakarshak prastaav kabhi nahin mila tha
 Recently, Fairfax paid $ 17 per share for 10 per cent stake in blackberry, while its stock market price was less than $ 9
 63 varshiya prem isse beparwaah hai
 He told the news agency Reuters, "if i am not confident about this high-profile deal, i would not have gone into it
 ”prem ko khud par bharosa he or isaki vajah he unka majboot trek record
 Prem, who studied at IIT Madras in 1971, could not enter IIM Ahmedabad
 lekin unhen khud par yakeen tha
 At the same time, he got a job in some companies of Hyderabad, as well as passed the entrance examination of this prestigious management college the following year
 ek maheene ke baad ve management kii padhai karne uniwarsity of western ontario chale gaye
 He started his career with the Confederation Life Insurance Company in Toronto and in 1984 became the co-founder of the Hamblin Watts Investment Council
 yah company ab ferefaques kaa hissaa he
 The following year he took control of Merkel Financial Holdings and in 1987 changed its name to Fairfax (short of Fair and Friendly Acquisitions)
 siddharth ankhon main chamak ke saath kehete hai, ''ve gaiyr-maamuli hindustani hai
 When he went to Canada he had only eight dollars in his pocket
 unki investment hi is baat kaa ishaara karti he ki unka dimag guna-bhaag main maahir he or unke paas apni company ke liye khaas najariya bhi he
 "in the coming years, Prem emerged as a sensible investor
 unhone kuch ajeebogareeb lekin thos kaarobaari faislon se ferefaques ko vaishvik beemaa or investment company main tabdeel kar diya
 When Prem started his career as an entrepreneur in 1985, the value of his insurance business was 1
 7 karod dollar thi jo 2012 main 7
 Reached 2 billion dollars
 pichley saal ferefaques kii beemaa or anya investment se aay 8 arab dollar or phayda 54 karod dollar par pahunch gaya

 He first bought 75 per cent of Thomas Cook (india) and part of IKWAA Human Capital Solution, a Bangalore-based HR management firm
 unke group ne isiisiaai lombard general insurance main bhi 26 fisadi hissedari kharid lee
 Prem stated in his first annual report in 1985, "our investment policy is based on the values that Ben Graham has created and is pursued by his capable disciple Warren Buffett
" iskaa aashay yah hua ki ham vittiya rup se majboot companiyon ke share us daam par kharidenge jo apni lambii avadhi main milane vaali keemton se kam par he
 We should expect to earn profits not only in two to four months, but only after a long time
 ” prem bhale hi canada main hon lekin unki nazren bharat par bhi hai
 Industry experts believe they will develop the Thomas Cook Company on the lines of Warren Buffett's investment vehicle firm Berkshire Hathaway
 jab prem ne pichley saal ikevie main 74 fisadi hisse ko 260 karod ru
 He bought Thomas Cook and not Mauritius-based registered investment company Fairbridge Capital for this purpose
 unke ek dost ke mutabik ''prem sidhe-sapaat nahin, balki tirchhi najar se bhi chizon ko dekhte hai
 According to Fairfax officials, Prem's eyes are on companies whose foundations are very strong and have the power to play long innings
 ikevie ke maamle main ise sahaj hi dekha ja saktaa he
 This company is making more profits than its rivals and in three years its profits will cross $ 1 billion
 pichley saal is adhigrahan se pehle prem se mulaakaat karne vaale is company ke sah-sansthaapak or siio ajit isaac ne kaha, ''pehle 30 second main hi aapako pataa chalaa jayega ki aap kisi aise aadmi se baat kar rahe hai jo badlaav laane main sakasham he; unki safagoi sidhe dil ko chooti he
 According to a senior Fairfax official, Prem is a positive-minded person
 ve chizon kaa andaja bahut jald laga lete hai
 They know what is the risk in a transaction and what can go wrong

 They say that if you are able to build a long-term business, then you will overcome the bad times

 kalpana kiijie aap bazaar main hai yaa restraan main
 Suddenly you have to mail an important document, but your laptop has battery dead
 yaa phir yah ki aap class main hai,laptopacopter laana bhul gaye hai or shatdown kii varning screen par flash karne lage
 Actually, this is such a problem, that every laptop user of the world is two-four in the late morning
 aisi paristhiti main yah maan liya jaataa he ki betry badalane yaa nai betry ke alaava koi doosraa upaay nahin he
 While there are many tips, with the help of which the battery backup of your laptop can be increased
 haalanki, iskaa yah arth nahin he ki aapke betry kii strenth bad jaaegi
 Actually, it reduces the power amount being spent by your laptop
 1) laptop ko betry sever mod yaa eco mod par rakhen
 This gives your laptop the ability to perform better in low power
 haalanki, iskaa screen kii britaness par thodaa fark padataa he, lekin thode samjhaute se badhiya byaap kaa fal bhi mil rahaa he
 2) Whenever the laptop is on
 ek saath kai hardware on ho jate hai
 Many of these hardware are not being used every time, yet the power of the battery is reaching them
 aise main un hardware ko tatkaal of yaa disable kar betry ke strenth ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 3) Laptops for example have many USB ports, but we are not using them every moment
 aise main inhen tatkaal disable kiya ja saktaa he
 Then when used, enable it without any hassle
 4) hardware ko disable yaa tatkaal of karne ke liye Device Manager kaa istemaal karen
 For this, right click on My Computer, click Properties and in the left sidebar click on Device Manager
 ab jis hardware ko disable karnaa chaahate hai, us par rhite clic karen or disable karen
 5) DVD / CD-ROM comes first in the highest battery spending hardware
 istemaal nahin hone ke kram main ise disable kiya ja saktaa he
 6) There is no point in keeping Bluetooth, wifi, card reader also enabled or on all the time
 aap istemaal karen na karen aapke betry kaa kuch hissaa yah hameshaa istemaal karte rahete hai
 7) While using Device Manager, take some caution in the matter that do not disable any hardware after which the laptop becomes difficult to use
 jaise hard discs ke kisi drive ko hi disable na kar den
 8) Whenever you turn on the laptop, open the task manager through Ctrl + Shift + Esc and get information about the apps that run in the background
 aap chahen to ctrl+alt+del dabaakar kisi aise ap ko band kar sakate hai jo aapaki najar main phijul he
 9) Many laptops have a backlight with keyboards
 jarurat na ho to ise disable kiya ja saktaa he
 10) Do not always keep display brightness at 100 percent
 50 fisadi par rakhana ek standard ho saktaa he
 11) It is not sensible to always put the display at 1080p
 aap chahen to basic 1366x768 ke rijolution par rakh sakate hai
 12) When the sound is never used, mute it or keep the sound level on zero
 13) sirf hardware hi nahin, becoground main chalane vaale ap or live tile bhi betry kii khapat badhaate hai
 It would be better to disable such apps
 14) agar betry kam charge he to ek saath kai kaam karne se bachein
 This will reduce the load on the processor and reduce battery consumption slightly
 15) laptop ko samay-samay par tun ap karte rahen
 That is, disk cleanup, defragment etc
 16) agar laptop kaa istemaal bistar par kar rahe hai to neeche paper yaa koi stand jarur rakhen
 Allow time for the hot air to drain
 17) laptop ko kabhi bhi charge main laga hua na chode
 For example, stop charging after work
 yaa phul charge hone par charging band kar den
 18) Keep updating software from time to time
 isse bhi betry byaap par asar padataa he
 a domineering in the Etah district of Uttar Pradesh carried out the rape of a woman at gunpoint
 aaropee mahila ko jaan se maarane kii dhamkee bhi di

 Her husband had gone out of the house

 And he interacted with the woman by showing a gun
 vaardaat ke baad aaropee ne mahila ko is ghatana ke bare main kisi ko bhi bataane par jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di
 He then escaped from the scene
 pehle to mahila ne dar kii vajah se kisi se kuch nahin kaha lekin baad main usne police se shikaayat karne kaa man bana liya
 a police officer said that on the basis of the complaint of the woman, the police has registered a case in this regard

 loksabhaa ke chunaav ke nateezon kii ulti ginati shuru ho chuki he
 In 24 hours, it will be clear whose government will be formed
 sabase pehle postal ballat kii ginati shuru hogi
 After this, the votes recorded in evms will be counted
 ab sawaal uthta he ki postal ballat (itipibies) kii ginati hi sabase pehle kyon kii jaati he
 Election Commission has rules regarding this
 aasaan bhashaa main kaha jaae to postal ballat kii sankhya kam hoti he or ye paper vaale mat patr hote hai or inhen gina janaa bhi aasaan hota he
 At the same time, there is no scope for any kind of matching
 kya hote hai Postal Ballot paperdfostel ballot papers ballat paper kii tarah hi hote hai
 Through this, the voter uses his vote
 par yah har kisi ko nahin milte hai
 Voting facility through postal ballot is available only to those performing election duties and army personnel
 iske alaava koi aisi suvidha nahin di jaati he
 People living in preventive detention also use it
 postal ballat se voting karne waalon kii sankhya chunaav ayog pehle hi nirdhaarit kar letaa he
 It is then sent to such voters via mail
 iske liye postal ballat paper ko scan kiya jaataa he or is scan copy ko atech karke bhej diya jaataa he
 Ballot is sent through postal service to such personnel and military officers who do not have any electronic facility
 agar kisi karanvash matadaata iskaa istemaal nahin karte hai yaa praapt nahin karte hai to yah bhejne vaale pate par laut aata he
 To whom are you given postal ballots, if you work for the army or the government or are stationed outside your state for election duty or you have been placed in 'preventive detention'
 chunaav ayog pehle hi chunavi kshetra main dak matdaan karne waalon kii sankhya ko nirdhaarit kar letaa he
 After which the blank postal ballot is delivered electronically to the voters
 ise Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System (ETPBS) kaha jaataa he
 If the voter is in a place where the electronic method cannot be used, then the ballot is sent from the postal service
 agar kisi kaaran voter iskaa prayog nahin kar paata to mataptr laut aata he
 What are ballot papers? Until the 80s, whatever elections were held in the country were on ballot paper
 ballat paper main pratyaashiyon ke chunaav chihn or naam chape hote the
 Each ballot paper was given a ballot paper at the polling station for each election
 phir matadaata apni pasand ke pratyaashee ke naam or chunavi chihn ke aage sil yaa thappa maar detaa tha
 This ballot paper was folded and put in the ballot box kept there
 kyon band kiya gaya tha ballat paper ko?jab saare vot pad jate the to is box ko chunaav adhikari sil band karke strang room tak pahunchaate the
 In this process, along with hard work, it costs a lot to maintain
 vahiin matdaan patr peti yani ballat box rakhwali bhi kaaphi mushkil hoti thi
 Not only this, booth capping events were also heard
 ballat paper matadaataaon ko dhamkaakar bhi voting karne kii ghatnaayen or ballat paper ke istemaal main bahut zyada kharch hota tha
 After which the Election Commission changed the system over time
 bharat main 1982 main kerala chunaav main ek poling booth par pehali EVM kaa istemaal kiya
 Since then, they are part of the election to be held till now
 yahaan milenge sabase tej nattejey2019 loksabhaa chunaav kaa sabase tej or sateek nattejey dekhne ke lietjtak

 In fact, a candle march was organized against the Kathua case and the Unnao incident on Friday, which also included Dinesh Gundurao, the chairman of the Working Committee of Karnataka
 is dauraan unhone unnav gangrape kii ghatana ko lekar upi ke siem yogi par karaara hamalaa bolaa
 He told the UP CM, "he is not a yogi, a pretender
 pradhanmantri modi ko unako barkhaast kar dena chahie
 "not only this, Gundurao even said that if Yogi comes to Karnataka again, he should be beaten with sandal and sent back
 is dauraan gundurav ne daawa kiya ki yogi adityanath ne bhartiya raajnneeti ko apamaanit kiya he or agar unamem tanik bhi naitikta hoti, to unako apane pad se istipha de dena chahie tha
 The BJP has become an attacker on this statement of Gundurao and has demanded an apology from the Congress
 bijepi ke mahasachiv ravi kumaar ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se maafee kii maang kii he
 He said that the BJP has declared a statewide protest against the Congress Party and its State President
 Mr Rao, your love for Muslims must not translate to hatred for Hindu saints
 What were you thinking when you said Yogi Adityanath must be beaten with chappals? hindu-vokkaligas of K'taka hold him in high regard
 You have insulted the entire community with your heinous comments!— BJP Karnataka (@bjp4karnataka)april 14, 2018gundurav ne vokkaliga samudaay kaa kiya apmaanakarnataka bijepi ne gundurav par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, ''gundurav aapkaa musalamaanon ke prati pyaar nishchit rup se hindu santon ke prati ghrinaa main nahin badalanaa chahie
 What were you thinking at the time when Yogi Adityanath should be beaten with chappals? The Hindu Vokkaligas of Karnataka consider CM Yogi a lot
 gundurav ne apane ghrinapurna bayaan se puure samudaay kaa apmaan kiya he
 "karnataka BJP has tweeted that 3,857 cases of rape have been registered in Karnataka during Siddaramaiah government, will Gundurao adopt the same logic against Siddaramaiah? On the disputed statement, Gundurao said that the BJP MLA is accused of rape

 iske baad hoicourt dakhal detaa he or exiaar darj karne ko kahata he
 The legislator is arrested on this
 unhone sawaal kiya ki kya ek sachcha yogi aisa karata he? Sanjay Baru's book, based on the controversial accounts during his tenure in the Prime Minister's Office, has been accused by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's daughter of betraying him in the back, accusing him of betrayal
 iske saath hi unhone kitaab ko aniatik, shararthpurna karrwai bataaya he
 Upinder Singh, the daughter of Manmohan Singh, who teaches at the University of Delhi, said that Baru has pieced together gossip and unconfirmed statements, some of which are about his father and used them as statements of facts
 kya yahi naitikta haiek saakshaatkaar main unhone pradhanmantri ke purv media salaahkaar kii kitaab ko bazaar main laae jane ke samay par bhi sawaal uthaaya he jo aam chunaav ke dauraan bazaar main ai he
 The Prime Minister's Office and the ruling Congress have suffered a lot of embarrassment due to this book
 upinder singh ne kaha ki ise sarthak kitaab nahin kaha ja saktaa
 This is the audacious account of the so-called statements that have been recorded as facts
 kahi gai baton ko pratyaksh baatcheet ke rup main liya gaya he
 Is this morality? Questioning some of the claims made by Baru in the book, she said that she had never been part of the policy-making process in the Prime Minister's Office
 chunaav ke baad kaa tha vadapradhanmantri manmohan singh kii beti ne kaha ki vah khud ko ghatnaon ke centre main pesh kar rahe hai jo ki sahi nahin he or unki filon tak pahunch nahin thi
 It was not that he was the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister
 upinder singh ne kaha ki vah pradhanmantri kii ore se nahin bol rahi hai balki ham is baat se behad acroshit hai ki lekhak ne kis prakaar badhaachadhaakar khud kaa bakhaan kiya he ki kitne ucch str tak unki pahunch thi
 He said that the family had information about the book coming to the market and when he asked Baru when the book would arrive, he said, it is natural that after the election
 shubhachintak nahin hai barukitab ke prakaashak dwaara iske vimochan kaa samay chune jane ke lekhak ke daawey ko galat bataate hue upinder ne kaha ki unhone bhi kai kitaaben likhi hai or jaanati hai ki kitaab ke vimochan ke samay ke bare main lekhak kii chalati he
 Sanjay Baru cannot call himself the Prime Minister's well-wisher

 Indian bowler Varun Aron seems to be in full rhythm before the Test series starts against hosts Australia, and has emerged as Team India's most successful bowler during practice matches
 edilade main khele gaye pehle abhyaas match main aron ne teen wicket chatkaaye the, jabaki duusare abhyaas match main unhone paanch wicket hasil kiye
 In both matches, Aaron troubled the Australian batsmen with his speed and line-length
 aise main test series ke dauraan bhartiya akraman kii kaman unke haathon main hogi, lekin varun aron ko lekar ek ashanka bhi hameshaa rahati he ki vah zyada teji ke chakkar main khud ko anfit kar lete hai, so, australian daure par aron ko apni fitness par dhyaan dena hoga
 Apart from Aaron, Mohammed Shami has also managed to keep pace with the Australian situation, so he too can put pressure on Australian batsmen along with Aaron
 shaami ne pehle abhyaas match main bhi do wicket hasil kiye the, or duusare abhyaas match main bhi unhone do wicket chatkaaye
 On the other hand, apart from these two, there are bowlers in the team like Ishant Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Umesh Yadav, so overall the fast bowling of the Indian team looks strong
 duusari ore, spin department main karn sharma bhi acchhee lay main dikh rahe hai
 He took two wickets in the first practice match, while in the second match he took a total of four wickets
 do abhyaas maichon main kul chah wicket lekar unhone sabit kiya he ki unki leg brake gugali australian ballebaazon ke liye musiibat khadi kar sakati he, so, vah team india kii ore se test debyue karne ke liye puri tarah taiyaar hai

 On the one hand, the cricketers would be showered with money and prizes, on the other, there is no one to ask for our national game

 Most hockey players are from poor backgrounds who desperately need money
 lekin naa to hockey india or naa hi centre sarkaar inaki sud leti he
 The players of Team India, who won the Cricket World Cup, looted money and plots like prizes by the Central Government and the State Governments
 lekin ab jab hockey team asian champion banakar lauti he to un sarkaron ne chuppi saadh rakhi he
 The question arises that does the government really consider hockey a national sport? chhattisgarh main aayush vishvavidhyalay ke embibies final part main fail chaatr punarmoolyankan ke baad 68 fisadi chaatr paas ho gaye
 Earlier investigations with this have come under suspicion
 raipur medical college ke 29 main 22 chaatr fail se paas ghoshit kiye gaye hai
 This means that 76 percent of the students have passed out of failure
 sims college bilaspur ke 17 main aath jagadalpur medical college ke 10 main saat chaatr fail se paas hue hai
 It may be noted that 56 students of Jagdalpur Medical College, Raipur, Bilaspur had applied to the university for revaluation, expressing dissatisfaction over the evaluation
 punarmoolyankan ke nattejey aane ke baad chaatro kaa shaq sahi sabit hua he
 He had also complained to the Dean of the respective colleges in this regard

 Knowledgeable states that Pt
 ravishankar shukla vishvavidhyalay main bie, eme jaisi pariksha ke moolyankan main itani gadabadi nahin hoti, jitani embibies ke moolyankan main hui he
 One thing is worth noting in the result of revaluation
 jo bhi chaatr fail se paas hue hai, unhone piesaim ke parche ke moolyankan main andeh jataayaa tha
 Numbers of 54 changed in 56 students
 matlab 96 fisadi student ke number piesaim main badal gaye
 ENT of four students, one student's eye has increased in the number of subjects

 In reality, the film is a story of the struggle of 15-year-old Insia and her mother Najma, a victim of domestic violence

 The release of Diwali also proved to have an impact on the film's business

 It was not wrong for Secret Superstar to be released this week, with a spice-rich film like Golmaal Again making it a loss
 golmaal kii vajah se sikret superstar ko screens bhi kam mili
 a major reason for the film's weakening at the box office is that Aamir's character is not as tall as it should have been
 jaayra ne apane hisse behatar kaam kiya he jitani unase ummid thi, lekin film main aamir kii maujuudagi hi sabase zyada antertaning he
 The length of Shakti Kumar's character could have benefited the film in terms of earnings without damaging the story

 Former Samajwadi Party (SP) General Secretary Amar Singh, who is standing on the margins of power, has his eyes firmly fixed on the waning evening of UPA and the rising sun of Mulayam Singh and his calculations have been fulfilled that if he wants to return So a better time will not come again

 When India Today asked him about his sudden turn, he replied, "I have come to know from our common contact sources that both Mulayam and Akhilesh have always been talking about me
 ve un puraane dinon ko yaad karte hai jab ham saath samay bitaate the
 If someone is speaking good about me then why should i speak bad about him? "he added," Even today, Akhilesh says that i will always be his uncle, so how can i not consider him my nephew? " Whatever the stance, they are well aware that Mulayam's ace is going to be the safest in the next general elections, with no single party coming to Parliament in majority

 Amar's alphas are still echoing in the ears of the SP leaders who had blown into the ears of the voters how Mulayam had betrayed him and "could not maintain honesty on both the sentiment and politics
" ’’chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan apane bhaashan ke ant main amar akasar ek chetavanee dete, ‘‘agar phir bhi upi kii janata mulaayam singh ko apana badshaah or unke bete ko shahjada saleem banaati he to uttar pradesh isi ke laayak he

 The party is not affected by this
 sapa ke pravaktaa rajendra choudhary yah kahkar saaf bachate najar aae, ‘‘unki tippanee par party koi dhyaan nahin detii
 "A senior cabinet minister of the SP government said," In praise of Mulayam, Amar's embroidery is part of a strategic effort to read the sp's attitude towards himself

 " Australian police said on Friday that at least five women from Melbourne had managed to join the terrorist organization Islamic State
 jabaki aise hi lagbhag darjanon maamle saamne aae hai
 Many women who have affection for the dangerous terrorist group have chosen to be 'jihadi brides'

 'linford expressed concern that' the number of women from Australia may be much higher, but there is more concern that they may be made sex slaves in Syria and Iraq
 ' On Sunday, on the issue of equal rights for women in Jammu and Kashmir, there was a war between Narendra Modi and Omar Abdullah, where the Prime Ministerial BJP candidate has accused of discrimination (with women), while Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said that Modi does not know the truth or is lying
 modi ne yah jatalane ke liye purush mahila bhedbhaav vivaad main umr kii bahan sara kaa naam bhi ghaseet liya ki unhen samaan adhikaar praapt nahin he
 He said, 'in the state (omar's sister) Sara should get the rights which Omar Abdullah enjoys
 ' sara kii shaadi kendriya mantri sachin payalat se hui he jo rajasthan ke rahane vaale hai
 Modi cited the example of the marriage of Omar Abdullah and his sister Sara, who were married outside the state, to show that women, like other parts of the country, do not have the same rights as men in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha, 'yadi (umr) abdulla ne kashmir ke baahar byaah kiya hota to unke (yahaan ke) naagarik hone ke adhikaar bane rahete jabaki unki bahan sara yah adhikari ganvaa baithi kyonki unhone kashmir se baahar shaadi kii or unke saare adhikaar chin liye gaye
 Is it not discrimination against women in the state? ' Modi questioned the people in the public meeting whether there was discrimination against women in Jammu and Kashmir, to which people responded in a loud voice 'yes'
 unhone phir poocha ki kya sara ko adhikaar mili, logon ne kaha, 'nahin'
 After Modi raised the issue of women's rights with reference to Article 370 of the Constitution, Omar gave a series of reactions to Twitter
 anuchhed 370 jammu-kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja detaa he
 Omar wrote on Twitter, 'he easily gave an example of me and my sister to justify a thing that has nothing to do with the truth
 vah jhooth bol rahe hai yaa phir jaankaree nahin he
 "he said," and ultimately women do not lose their local residence rights by marrying residents of other states as the campaign is going on
 ' He wondered (not knowing) whether Modi is actually aware of Article 370 of the Constitution, which gives special status to Jammu and Kashmir
 umr ne kaha, 'main unhen or unke kisi bhi maatahat ko anuchhed 370 ko shabdash: rakhane kii chunauti detaa hum jisamen jammu-kashmir ke rajya sambandhi maamle tay kiye gaye hai
 He also said that Modi has very incomplete information or he skimp in telling the truth

 In this way, five countries including India united against Pakistan in this block of eight countries

 isliye bharat ke virodh ke baad iskaa talanaa tay tha
 But after complaining to the president's country together with the five countries, Pakistan appeared to be completely isolated among the regional countries on the issue of terrorism

 janardan reddy par karnataka main avaidh khanan ke lage aaropon kii bhi jaanch karne kaa nirdesh diya
 CBI is already investigating Reddy's illegal mining in Andhra Pradesh
 gyaat ho ki andhra pradesh main avaidh khanan ke aaropon ke chalate karnataka ke purv mantri janardan reddy hyderabad kii ek jail main hai
 Reddy, a minister in the BS Yeddyurappa-led government of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Karnataka, has always said that his mining business is limited to Andhra Pradesh only and he does not have a mining business in Karnataka
 sibiai ne gat paanch sitambar ko andhra pradesh main avaidh khanan ke aarope main bellari se reddy ke saath obulapuram khanan company ke prabandh nideshak bivi shrinivas reddy ko giraftaar kiya
 Both are currently in Chanchalaguda jail in Hyderabad
 ullekhneey he ki sarvocch nyaayalay ne yah nirdesh kendriya adhikaar praapt samiti (seeisi) kii us report ke baad diya he jisamen samiti ne kaha he ki karnataka main associated mining company par reddy or unki patni kaa malikana haq he jo rajya main avaidh khanan main sanlipt he

 m
instructions have also been given to investigate jain kii swaamitv vaali deccan mining sindicket kii khanan gatividhiyon kii jaanch karne ke bhi nirdesh die hai
 This instruction of the Supreme Court has been welcomed by the Congress and the Janata Dal (secular)
 jaipur rajasthan kaa sabase bada or sabase teji se badhata hua shahar he
 However, it would be ironic that despite being India's first planned city, New Jaipur itself is an example of unplanned development
 iske jo master plan banaae jate hai, unka uddeshy sirf anadhikrut coloniyon ko niyamit karne or aise nirmaan karne ke liye hota he, jisase kuch logon ke hit sadhate hai
 Generally, there have not been any governments that have had any view of planned development here
 mukhya shahar kaa bahari ilaakon se sampark kharaab he, sadakon par jam laga rahata he, parking kii jagah kam he or jameen kii keemat itani zyada ho gai he ki kaayade kii jagah par makaan lenaa mumkin nahin rah gaya he
 This is the reason that now the demand for skyscrapers in the city is increasing
 iske liye bhi shahar ke paas koi yojana nahin he
 The result of this is that even in the outskirts like Bapu Nagar and Tilak Nagar, multi-storey apartments are seen standing way
 shahar main harith kshetra bamushkil hi bachaa he or aabaadi or vaahanon kii sankhya ne jivan str or bijli-pani jaisi buniyadi suvidhaon ko prabhavit kiya he
 There is a demand from the builders to build skyscrapers in densely populated areas like Tonk Road, Bapu Nagar and Lal Kothi
 bilderon ko is baat kii koi phikr nahin he ki is kism kaa nirmaan sthaneey logon par kya asar daalega kyonki ve sirf paisa bananaa chaahate hai
 That is why the government needs to work honestly and formulate a well-planned strategy for development of the city's minaret
 jaipur ke builder jecedi parl group main nideshak sunil kumaar sharma kehete hai ki oonchai vaale vikaas ke liye ek samgr yojana kii jarurat he
 In his words, "we want the government to make rules that create a healthy and fair competition environment
" iske alaava upabhoktaaon ke liye paryaapt vikalp maujuud hon
 The future of Jaipur and other cities of Rajasthan is true, the minaret is rooted in development
 ” mangalam bilders or developers ke diarector ajay gupta kehete hai, ''aage kii ore badaae se suvidhaon ko bhi aage le janaa padataa he, is tarah vertical growth hi zyada kargar he
 Vijay Jain, director of architect-turned-builder JKD Pearl Group, says that upward development is necessary to make maximum use of infrastructure
 unki raay main, ''samekit vikaas hona chahie taaki ham sabhi ke liye bahumanjila imaaraten uplabdh karvaa saken
 Economically weaker sections should also get such flats so that they can stay close to their office
 ” world trade park ke chairman anup bartaria kaa maananaa he, ''shahar ke kareeb rahane se buniyadi suvidhaon tak pahunch aasaan rahati he
 “it is believed that the government can solve the problems of land acquisition and infrastructure through the planned path of minaret development if desired
 jain kehete hai, ''jaipur sabase teji se badhate shaharon main se ek he, jiske vikaas kii dar 4
 9 percent
 yadi ham minari vikaas ko thik se niojit kar sake to dusron ke liye bhi ek misaal pesh kar sakenge
 Jain is a strong supporter of the redevelopment of old residences
 unhen is tarah ke kaam kaa anubhav bhi he
 He said, "we can take any old residential area which is suppose to be developed within a radius of two square kilometers
 phir vahaan ham bahumanjila imaarat khadi kar sakate hai, jahaan flats se lekar vyavsaayik parisar tak sari suvidhaayen maujuud hon
 "this will help in planning for integrated development and take care of thousands of people, rather than building apartments on a small plot as is practiced nowadays
 in yojanakaaron or visheshgyon se baatcheet ke baad jo suzav or samaadhaan nikalakar aae, unamem kuch is prakaar hai:1
 The government should identify places in major areas where it has to approve skyscrapers
 aisi sabhi imaaraton main parking or harith kshetra kii jagah honi chahie
 Tall buildings on narrow streets should not be approved unless their plot sizes are large
 apartment ko bade bhukhndon par hi manjuuri di jaani chahie or oonchai main bhi ek tarah kii samanta tay kii jaae; 2
 Serious studies will have to be conducted on population and vehicular density, electric water supply and green area; 3
 bahari ilaakon main nai coloniyaan basaai jaani chahie lekin unka sadakon se sampark acha hona chahie; 4
 a pilot project for the re-development of an old-fashioned area should be taken up and then implemented elsewhere
 aniojit minari vikaas vaale ilaake, jahaan aaj niyaman kii jarurat he, ve hai: jawaharlal nehru maarg, jawahar cirkil, tonk road, tilak nagar, baapu nagar
 Apart from this, the areas which are spread on the ground and where multi-storey buildings can be built are: Malviya Nagar, Vaishali Nagar, Shyam Nagar, Gandhi Nagar and Lal Kothi
 duusari ore, jin nae ilaakon ko swatantra makaanon or vila coloniyon ke liye sweekrut kiya ja saktaa he, ve hai: agra road kii taraf jagatpura or pratap nagar, amer ke aage dilli road, ramgarh, sanganer or kukas ke aasapaas vaale ilaake

 bjp's performance against the Election Commission in Delhi and Varanasi has ended after the controversy over Narendra Modi's rally in Varanasi
 varanasi main arun jetali, amit shah, anant kumaar or lakshmikant vaajapeyi kii aguwai main bijepi kaaryakartaaon ne banaras hindu uniwarsity (biechayu) ke lanka get par dharna diya
 a large number of people have gathered in this strike
 vahiin dilli main chunaav ayog ke karyaalay ke saamne ravishankar prasad, mukhtaar abbaas nakvi sahit bijepi ke kai netaaon ne dharna diya
 Senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley, who was sitting on a dharna in Varanasi, told NDTV India that not allowing Narendra Modi's rally in the name of security is wrong and by not correcting the election officer's mistake, the Election Commission also showed weakness is
 narendra modi rohaniya main raily karne ke baad shaam saadhe chaar baje biechayu helipad par utrenge or uske baad rabindra puri, lanka bypass, shivala, sonarpura, madanpura, guduliya, girijaghar, laksha, gurubaag, rathyatra chauraahaa hote hue kendriya karyaalay pahunchenge
 Earlier, Narendra Modi tweeted about the case, "today i apologize to Maa Ganga for not doing Aarti
 ummid he ye log samaj paaen ki ek maa kaa pyaar raajnneeti se upar he
 
 
 " modi ne twit main kaha, "yah durbhagyapurna he ki chunaav ayog santhaan kii nishpakshta ko lekar gambhir nahin he
 This is the reason why our workers have to do Satyagraha
 unhone kaha, main apane kaaryakarta bhai−bahanon se apil karata hum ki ve shanti banaaen rakhen or ye sunishchit karen ki aam logon ko koi pareshaani na ho
 " is vivaad ke baad varanasi ke dm pranjal yadav ne samvaadadaataaon se baat karte hue kaha ki narendra modi ke paanch kaaryakramon main se chaar ko jald se jald ijaajat di gai, jabaki beniabag ilaake main raily ko suraksha kaarnon se nahin karne diya gaya
 The administration says that according to the report from the local intelligence, the rally was not allowed in this area
 dm kii safai ke baad bijepi netaa amit shah ne kaha ki party ne apane saare kaarykram waapas le liye hai or ab vah satyagrah ke maarg par hi aage badhegi
 On the other hand, after the bjp's decision to protest against the Election Commission, the Election Commission has responded to his letter to Arun Jaitley
 chunaav ayog ne likhaa he ki vah bijepi ke faisle se hairaan or niraash he
 The Commission says that the rally is allowed by the District Magistrate or the local officer, not the Election Commission

 The JF-17 is a light combat aircraft

 It has been jointly developed by Pakistan and China
 dhanova ne donon ladaaku vimaanon main behatar ke bare main puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki ham use kis tarah se las karte hai
 i am convinced that we have made better aircraft
 unhone kaha ki ek aviation jarnal main ek bahut acha aalekh he
 It states that the JF-17 is not technically modern like Tejas
 isliye , jeef - 17 aaj kaa ladaaku vimaan he kyonki unhone hamaari tulana main kahin adhik squadran laga rakhaa he lekin tejas bhavishya kaa ladaaku vimaan he
 It has much better systems

 (input bhashaa se) Mohalla clinics opened for the purpose of door to door health facilities in Delhi itself look ill
 dilli ajtak kii team ne purvi dilli ke kai mohalla clinics main reality check kiya
 The difference between the promises of the government and the ground reality was found in the sky
 mohalla clinics par khud AAP sarkaar main mantri rah chuke kapil mishra ghotle kaa aarope laga chuke hai
 What is the truth of the government's claims, its reality check has its poll open
 
 
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii mahatvakankshi pariyojna mohalla clinics kii jabase neenv rakhi gai he, tabase ye surkhiyon main bane hue hai
 The AAP government, which came to power with the objective of providing door-to-door health, claimed to have opened 1000 Mohalla clinics
 lekin sachai ye he ki puri dilli main kul 100 clinics hi khul paae hai, jo clinics khuli bhi hai, unamem marizo ko lab facility abhi tak uplabdh nahin karai ja saki he
 We investigated four Mohalla clinics in East Delhi and found that lab facilities in three of the four clinics had not yet been operationalized
 tahitpur clinics main suvidhaon kaa abhavsbase pehle aapako dikhaate hai tahitpur mohalla clinics kaa haal
 It has been more than three months since this mohalla clinic has been opened, but the patients here have not been able to get any facility other than common medicines
 hamane is mohalla clinics kii padtaal kii or lab assistant ne bataae chaunkaane vaale sach
 The lab assistant present here said- 'there is no lab here, only basic test of sugar is done, a mohalla clinic nearby is open in Dilshad Garden, there is open lab facility through outsourcing
 paas main jitibi he, yahaan ke marizon ko vahaan bhej dete hai
 Only medicine is available here '
 bade aspataalon se boj kam karne ke makasad se jagah-jagah mohalla clinics kholi gai thi ki choti-moti bimariyon ke liye marizon ko aspataal main dhakke nahin khaane pade
 The clinic built over the drain, but here the lab assistant himself opened the claims of the Chief Minister's claims
 na lab suvidha he auki na hi puraa staff jiskaa khamiyaaza aam marizon ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 Lab assistant told- 'I am posting from my dispensary, i go there one day and come here one day
 mainpavar kii kami he, alternet days main duty kar rahaa hum
 Everyone knows, the crowd of patients increases
 do din ke peshant ek din main dekhne padate hai
 'patients also have to say something similar
 mohalla clinics main dikhaane aae ek mariz ne bataaya, ' test likh dete hai to jitibi jate hai'
 Moreover, the Tahirpur Mohalla clinic built over the drain is in constant danger of falling ill
 tahitpur ke sthaneey nivasee karan singh ne bataaya, 'ye clinics bana to die hai, lekin koi suvidha nahin he, inke paas itani power nahin he ki kisi bade aspataal main refer kar den
 You see how dirty the surrounding area is'
 test ke liye bade aspataal bhejte hanmansarovar mohalla clinics kaa bhi kuch aisa hi haal he
 The doctor also acknowledged the lack of clinics, but she also appeared compelled to face the system
 clinics main posted doctor ne bataaya, '17 march se chaalu he, kuch nahin he yahaan, lab facelity nahin he yahaan, test ke liye SDN yaa GTB refer kar dete hai
 When asked to authority, they speak under process
 pesheynt pareshaan hota he
 They have to roam around
 'maansarovar park kii is mohalla clinics ke aasapaas kii gandagi alag hi kahani bayaan kar rahi he jisase aasapaas ke sthaneey log bhi khafa hai
 Kamal, a local, said, "the facility is nothing, there is no use, the dust is so much, there is no cleanliness"
 darasal aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne ye vaada kiya tha ki in mohalla clinics main 200 se bhi zyada lab test free kiye jaaenge
 But after checking the reality of these Mohalla clinics in East Delhi, the claims of the government's claims are open
 ab aapako bataate hanseemapuri cheemohalla clinics kaa haal
 Due to being on the Delhi UP border, the local people here are facing different problems
 ek marij saaera ne bataaya, 'parchi bana di thi or bole dobaaraa mat aana, simapuri kaa pataa maang rahe hai'
 At the same time, Mehraj said, 'there is a lot of trouble, still saying that go to Dilshad Colony
 vahaan kehete hai kibade aspataal jaao,ye kaisaa mohalla clinics he'
 Here too, only a few tests are done in the name of lab test
 test ke liye yahaan mariz bade aspataalon ke dhakke khaane ke liye majaboor hai
 The tussle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra over government formation continues
 chunaav se pehle donon partiyon kaa gathbandhan sarkaar gathan par ulajh gaya he
 There is no consensus between the two political parties
 shivasena jahaan sarkaar main badi hissedari chaahati he, vahiin bijepi iske liye taiyaar nahin he
 Meanwhile, veteran Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has given a big statement on government formation
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki bijepi maharashtra main sabase badi party he, bijepi ko sarkaar banane ke liye pehla avasar dena chahie
 If BJP fails to form a government, then we will form a government
 sanjay raut ne is dauraan dastavej bhi dikhaae or kaha ki hamare paas bahumat he
 Sanjay Raut while showing the document said that everything is ready
 bhaajapa ke paas jaadui aankada paane ke liye idi or governor housesanjay raut ne kaha, 'sabase pehle bhaajapa sabase badi party he, unhen pehle sarkaar banane kaa avasar milanaa chahie
 They took so many people from Congress and NCP and with them they reached only 105
 ve ayaaraam-gayaram (congress ensipi) kii raajnneeti karte hai
 They should get the first opportunity
 unke paas 145 kaa jaadui aankada paane ke liye idi or governor house hai
 Despite this, today they are threatening President's rule
 'lekin agar aap sarkaar banane main naakaam rahe to shivasena 145 kaa jaadui aankada degi
 The Shiv Sena is very capable of forming the government
 hamane aise logon ke liye samarthan patr taiyaar kiya he jo sarkaar banane main hamaari madad karenge
 If the BJP fails to form a government, we will take it to the Governor
 hamaare paas bahumat he
 i am not speaking in the air
 sanjay raut un kaagajon ko dikhaate hue kaha ki hamaare paas samarthan he or ham sarkaar banaaenge
 He said, 'look at this document, everything is ready
 main sirf itnaa kahuunga ki hamaare paas aankada he
 But first give BJP a chance
 'unhone kaha, 'haa sarkaar banane main bahut deree hui he
 The BJP is the largest party that they should stake at stake to form the government
 unke paas navnirvaachit vidhayakon kii suchi he, unhen suchi saunpny hogi
 Doubt why they are not doing it
 aisa lagata he ki bijepi sarkaar banane main naakaam rahi he
 Here the governor has every right to find ways to form a government
 rajyapal ko su moto karrwai kerani chahie thi jo nahin ho rahi he
 We are also very worried
 'ab tak maine dekha he ki koi bhi kaarykaal khatm hone tak pratiksha nahin karata he, isse pehle wo keval shapath le rahe hai
 November 9 is the last day of this government, this time i think Devendra Fadnavis will remain CM till his last breath
 uske baad devendra fadanvis or rajyapal kya karenge, ham kya nahin jaanate
 According to the latest data from the Meteorological Department, the monsoon winds have come to a standstill since June 12
 monsoon kii takat kamjor padane kii vajah se monsoon kii barish is samay sirf or sirf purvottar bharat or western ghat tak hi simit rah gai he
 The calculations through supercomputers are predicting that the monsoon winds will increase after June 23, but the kind of weather conditions that are occurring are certainly worrisome for the country
 monsoon kii barish saamanyataja aankadon ke mutabikmonsunaki uttari seemaa is samay thane, ahmednagar, buldhana, amravati, gondia, titalgarh, katak, midanapur se hote hue gwalpada or bagdogra se hokar guzar rahi he
 Since June 12, the line has stayed here and weather experts say that the probability of monsoon winds moving for the next 5 to 6 days is unlikely
 aisa isliye he kyonki monsoon kaaphi kamjor pad chukaa he
 According to Charan Singh, director of the Meteorological Department, if we look at the figures of rain so far, the monsoon rain is normal, but when the depth of the data goes, then this happiness proves wrong
 vajah yah he ki is samay jo barish ho rahi he vah western ghat or purvottar bharat main ho rahi he
 The rainfall on the Western Ghats is high in volume, but these rains return to the Arabian Sea in a very short time
 vahiin purvottar bharat kii baat karen to yahaan par bhi kam samay main hui zyada barish ke chalate baadh jaisi sthiti paidaa ho gai he agar bharat kii mukhya bhoomi kii baat karen to yahaan par abhi bhi monsoon kii barish vaise nahin hui he jaisi honi chahie
 If we look at the meteorological statistics, till June 18, 78 in the whole country
 7 mili meter ausat barish hui he
 78 on average by this time
 7 millimetre kii hi barish hoti he
 If we look at the rains in East and Northeast India, here 149
 00 mili meter kii barish ab tak hui he yah takreeban 22 fisadi saamaanya ke mukaable kam he
 Similarly 28 in North West India so far this season
 4 millimetre kii saamaanya barish ke mukaable 26
 Normal rainfall of 9 mm is 5 percent less than normal
 dakshin main hui acchhee barishdakshin bharat kii baat karen to yahaan par 87
 122 against an average rainfall of 5 millimeters
 8 millimetre kii ausat barish record kii gai he jo saamaanya ke mukaable 40 se zyada he
 Due to excess rainfall in South India, the rains are being reported on the Western Ghats here, while the amount of rain in the interiors is quite low
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik 18 june tak monsoon amuman bihar, jharkhand, chhattisgarh, oreisha, madhya pradesh, gujarat ke saath-saath puri uttar pradesh tak pahunch jaataa he or isi ke saath uttarakhand or himachal pradesh ke tamaam ilaakon main bhi monsunaki barish hone lagati he lekin is baar monsoon kii sthiti kamjor hone kii vajah se monsooni hawaaen pashchim bengal ko bhi puri tareeke se apane agosh main nahin le pai hai
 a large part of Odisha is untouched by the monsoon rains, while in the case of Chhattisgarh, a large part of monsoon rains have not yet occurred
 madhya pradesh main to monsoon kii hawaaen abhi tak pahunchi hi nahin he
 In Gujarat, by June 15, the monsoon takes the entire state under its control, but this time the monsoon is also from here
 purvi uttar pradesh main 15 june ke aasapaas monsoon dastak de detaa he lekin is baar puravaiya kii bajaae yahaan par pachua hawaaon ne apana ghar kar rakhaa he in sthitiyon main aisa lagata he ki monsoon ke liye abhi dilli dur he
 On February 14, 40 CRPF personnel were killed in a terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir
 deshbhar main tairar atake kii ninda ho rahi he
 In this difficult time, the whole country stands with the families of the martyrs
 salmaan khan, amitabh bachchan, aditya dhar, dilajit dosanjh or total dhamal kii team ne shaheedon ke parivaar ko aarthik madad pahunchaai
 Haryana's star dancer Sapna Chaudhary also wants to help the martyrs, but they are not able to do so because of special reasons
 darasal, sapana choudhary ne ludhiana main ek event main parform kiya tha
 But the organizer has not yet paid them in full
 sapana ye puraa paisa shaheedon ke parivaar ko dena chaahati hai
 There was talk of giving 8 lakh to Sapna Chaudhary for performance
 lekin unhen sirf 6 lakh kii hi pement kii gai he
 According to a Times of India report, Sapna Chaudhary's brother Vikas has lodged a police complaint after the event organizers were not given the full amount

 Former IAS officer Surendra Pangati suggests measures to prevent migration, "migration occurs due to lack of employment and can be overcome by tourism, pilgrimage and herb production

 Appointment at such places is considered as posting posting
 yahi vajah he ki rajya ke vaarshik plan tak kaa paisa kharch karnaa tedi kheer ban gaya he

 According to Indu Kumar Pandey, former chief secretary of the troubled state, the dependency ratio of the hill districts of the state is 1: 1 due to increase in youth migration
 34 ho gaya he
 This means that the village has 134 old people against a hundred youth
 jo bachche gaanv main rah gaye hai ve skool jane ke liye taiyaar ho rahe hai or aise main vridhon kii sehat or bacchon kii padhai ke liye rajya ko vahaan zyada kharch karnaa padegaa
 Due to dwindling population and its spread far and wide, it is difficult to serve in the hill areas
 parivahan, peyajal, bijli, shiksha, chikitsa or sadak yahaan pahunchaana mushkil kaam he
 This is the reason why even today the wires of more than 5,000 villages are not connected to the roads
 uttarakhand kranti dal ke netaa kaashi singh airi kehete hai, ''rajya ke gathan ke baad se lagbhag 20 lakh log rajya se palaayan kar chuke hai
 This was the condition when the 2013 disaster did not occur

 Based on the 2001 census, in 2006, under the state delimitation, out of the 40 assembly seats in Pahar, 6 seats were cut due to population reduction, these 6 seats increased in the plains
 is tarah ab pahaad main sirf 34 siten rah gayi or maidan main 36 siten ho chuki hai, jabaki 9 jile pahaad main aate hai or maidan main chaar hi jile hai
 Due to migration in the mountains, the population keeps decreasing in this way, and in the delimitation of 2026, more seats will be cut from the mountains and go into the ground
 aise main swaabhaavik he ki rajya vidhansabha main pahaado kaa pratinidhitiv hi kam rah jayega or iskaa sidhaa asar pahari kshetron, khaskar gramin ilaakon ke vikaas par par padegaa
 The forced, same number of non-populated villages in the rookies has also worried the Chief Minister of the state Harish Rawat

 bangladesh ke ek akhbaar 'pratham aalo' ke ek vigyaapan ne bhartiya cricket kii duniya main alag tarah kii halchal machaa di he
 This ad has written, 'tiger steshnari bangladesh main banaaya gaya The "mustafizur Cutter" is found here, hamane istemaal kiya he, aap bhi karen' The amazing thing is that this cutter found in stationery shops has shaved half of Indian players' heads
 bhartiya fans ise chahen to mazaaq main le sakate hai or chahen to bura bhi maan sakate hai
 Behind this advertisement is a recently concluded Test and three ODI india-bangladesh cricket series, in which India suffered a historic defeat
 bangladesh kii is jeet main unke 19 saal ke baane haath ke gendbaaz mustaafizur rahamaan kii behad ahm bhoomika rahi thi
 Team India and its fans will not forget Mustafizur Rahman, a 19-year-old left-arm fast bowler for a long time
 bangladesh kii jeet main 13 wicket lekar 'main of da series' banane vaale mustaafizur ab bangladesh ke superstar ban gaye hai
 Mustafizur is featured in many advertisements in Bangladesh
 ise kehete hai sir mundaate hi ole padana
 This will also be the case for the head shaved players in the Bangladesh advertisement
 bhartiya chayankartaaon ne khulkar mana he ki unhen bhi bhartiya haar kaa dard he
 After losing to Bangladesh, millions of Indian fans have also criticized the team and now in Bangladesh too, there is a joke about that defeat
 team india ke fans main agar is baat ko lekar naaraazgi he, to mauqaa-mauqaa vigyaapan ko yaad kijie
 Through these advertisements, funny advertisements were also made for countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and south-africa
 phir 'baccha ab baccha nahin rahaa' to bharat-bangladesh series se thik pehle chalaae gaye the
 There is a saying in English - 'what goes around comes around' means 'if you miss the arrow of humor or humor, then you will also return'
 isliye ise chahen to aap achche mazaaq main len yaa fir apane kiye kaa aainaa samajhen- ahm ye he ki daavon kaa khel kam khelen or asli khel acha khelen to hi aap surakshit hai, varanaa jaisi kerani waisi bharani
 His 19-year-old left-arm bowler Mustafizur Rahman played a very important role in this victory of Bangladesh
 team india or uske fans lambey samay tak 19 saal ke baane haath ke tej gendbaaz mustaafizur rahamaan ko nahin bhuulenge
 Mustafizur, who became 'man of the Series' with 13 wickets in Bangladesh's victory, has now become Bangladesh's superstar
 bangladesh ke kai vigyapanon main mustafizur chaaye hue hai
 It is called hail when you shave your head
 bangladesh ke vigyaapan main sir mundaate khilaadiyon ke liye bhi ye tis kii hi baat hogi
 Indian selectors have openly acknowledged that they too are in the pain of Indian defeat
 bangladesh se haarane ke baad lakhon bhartiya fans ne bhi team kii aalochana kii he or ab bangladesh main bhi us haar ko lekar mazaaq ho rahaa he
 If there is resentment about this in the fans of Team India, then miss the opportunity advertisement
 in vigyapanon ke zarie pakistan, bangladesh or dakshin-africa jaise deshon ke liye bhi mazaaq bhare vigyaapan banaae gaye the
 Then the 'baby is no longer a child' was run just before the india-bangladesh series
 angrezi kii ek kahawat he- 'what goes around comes around' yani 'vyangy yaa mazaaq ke tir chhutenge to waapas bhi lautenge'
 So, if you want to do it in a good joke or you should understand the mirror of your work - the important thing is that you play less of the claims and play the real game only then you are safe, otherwise you have to do the same

 About 75 hundred people have shared and more than three thousand people have given their views
 sanghathan ne bataaya ki ukt makaan maalik ne saanp ko dekhakar turant unase sampark kiya
 On the snake's notice, the team went there and caught the snake and brought it with them

 jaanate hai champions trophy ke liye kin khilaadiyon ko standby par rakhaa gaya he? champions trophy ke liye standby main rakhe khilaadiyon main bhi gautam gambhir or harbhajan singh ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 This is bound to raise the question whether the hope of his return is over? champions trophy ke liye ek sef, majboot or anbhavi team kaa chayan hua he
 The important thing is that the selectors have not paid attention to the IPL form
 or yahi vajah bhi rahi ki team main koi nayaa naam yaa phir yun kahen ki koi sarprize nahin dikhaa
 This does not mean that the focus of the selectors is not on the future
 cheef silector emesake prasad ne champions trophy ke liye standby par rakhe gaye khilaadiyon ke naam bhi share kiye
 Rishabh Pant, Kuldeep Yadav, Shardul Thakur, Suresh Raina and Dinesh Karthik have been placed on standby for the Champions Trophy
 in sabhi khilaadiyon ne gharelu toornament main shandaar khel dikhaaya he or ipel main bhi apane pradarshan se prabhavit kiya he
 Not only this, Prasad has especially praised Rishabh Pant for preparing him for the future
 emesake prasad, mukhya chayankarta ne kaha ki jis tarah se rishabh ballebaazi kar rahe hai, unke khel se sabhi prabhavit hai
 We will groom them and focus on making them a successful Indian player in future
 iske alaava england main do spinners ke saath jane or koi rist spinner team main shaamil naa hone par prasad ne kuldeep yadav kaa zikr karte hue bataaya ki aakhir kyon vah 15 khilaadiyon main shaamil nahin he
 Chief selector MSK Prasad said that we discussed the name of Kuldeep, which could prove to be a surprise package, but then we also have options like Yuvraj and Kedar
 jis tarah se wo shape-ap kar rahe hai wo kaabile taareef he, bhavishya main un par nazar rahegi
 But in all these things, one thing has become clear somewhere, and that leave the main Indian team, players like Gautam Gambhir and Harbhajan Singh are not even part of the back-up plan of the selectors
 or ye tab he jab donon hi khilaadi ipel main shandaar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Does this mean that the hope of return of these players has now stopped? haal hi main uri hamale ke baad baraamula aatanki hamale main shahid nitin yadav par ompuri kii tippanee ne kaaphi logon ko naaraaz kar diya tha
 In a TV channel debate, Om Puri had said who had told the martyr jawan to be recruited in the army to take a bullet
 haalanki baad main om puri apane ankhon main pashchaatap ke aansu bharkar shahid nitin yadav ke ghar pahunche the
 In the village, he garlanded the portrait of the martyr jawan and also visited his tomb

 In view of this, 500 additional police forces have been deployed at major 10 locations

 iske baad akhaadon ke sadhu apane apane gantavyon kii ore lautnaa shuru kar dete hai
 However, the Kumbh Mela will last till March 4 and this day will be concluded with Mahashivratri bath
 basant panchami par sangam tat par shahi snaan kaa behad khaas mahatv he
 It is believed that by taking a dip three times today, devotees get the blessings of Ganga, Yamuna and the invisible Saraswati
 ye bhi manyata he ki triveni main jo bhakt makar sankranti, mauni amavasya ke baad basant panchami ke tisare shahi snaan par bhi sangam snaan karata he, use purna kumbh snaan kaa fal miltaa he

 Bindas Bala Bipasha Basu of Bollywood sweats a lot to maintain her slim physique, but she cannot control herself after seeing the sweets

 Oops! ’I am the Defective Peace: Bipasha Basumithe fond of Bipasha goes everywhere to find a special dish
 or shahar main bhi pehla kadam rakhte hi car ke driver se unhone yahi poocha ki yahaan mithe main sabase acha kya he? Padmavati's release date has gone ahead and the new date has not been revealed yet
 pehle khabaren ai thim ki film agle saal 12 janvari ko relies hogi, lekin sibiefasi kii baat sunakar yah lag rahaa he ki film janvari main to relies nahin ho sakati
 Prasoon has said that given the current status of the film, it may take 68 days to give a certificate to the film
 unka yah bayaan un media reports ko conform karata dikh rahaa he, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki sensor board ne film ke mekars dwaara certificate dene kii prakriya ko jaldi karne kii arji thukraa di he
 Sacrifice of lakhs lost in a character of Padmavati, several big issue issues said this while talking to media at IFFI on Monday
 unhone film ko sensor board main sabamit karne se pehle kuch mediapersons ko film dikhaane par apni niraashaa bhi jaahir kii
 He said that if people want the censor board to take a decision on the film, then they will have to give time, freedom and mental space to the board
 unhone kaha- yah 68 din kaa samay le saktaa he kyonki is par faisla lene ke liye samitiyaan banane main samay lagegaa
 Generally, films take less time than this, but the situation of this film is slightly different
 agar log sadak par virodh kar rahe hai to kya iske liye sibiefasi ko doshi thaharnaa chahie? agar mekars film media ko dikhaa dete hai to kya isamen bhi sibiefasi kii galati he? lekin aap chaahate hai ki sibiefasi is par samajhadaari se faisla le
 But how can it take the right decision if you do not give it time and freedom? I'm from the film industry, so i understand the filmmakers, i understand Sanjay Leela Bhansali, but it's not about them, it's about the controversy surrounding the film
 padmavati par 5 prahaar, kahin khuli dhamkee to kahin bavaal, baikfoot par mekarsbhansaali or deepika padukon ko di ja rahi dhamkiyon kii joshi ne kadi ninda kii
 He said that he would keep all the communities in mind before deciding on the film
 yah samay vivaadon kaa kam or sochane kaa zyada he or iske liye hamen dhairya rakhana hoga
 This situation has not been created by CBFC, but is expecting a solution from it
 jab aap aisi ummid kar rahe hai to hamen puraa samay bhi dijie

 At the same time, the Congress is forgetting the bitter memories of the 2014 elections and trying to beat the Modi Factor through the grand alliance, trying to renew the equations
 modi sarkaar mahangaai, berogari samet tamaam muddon par ghiri hui he
 The opposition is constantly attacking
 ye saare mudde vahi hai jinako uchhaalkar 2014 main bijepi upie ko haraane main safal rahi thi
 But despite all efforts, the Congress and the opposition are still not successful in putting the issue against the Modi government
 yahaan ham un 5 muddon kii baat karenge jo 2014 main modi sarkaar kii jeet kaa kaaran bane the, lekin aaj bhi jas ke tas hai
 The Opposition wants to raise these issues prominently and win 2019
 1
 Inflation Belgaum In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi made rising inflation a major election issue
 narendra modi ne 100 din ke bheetar mahangaai par ankush lagane kaa vaada kiya tha
 Today, 4 years after BJP came to power, rising inflation remains the biggest challenge
 petrol-dijal kii keemten itihaas ke sabase oonche str par pahunch gai hai
 Petrol Price 86 in Mumbai on 4 September
 72 ke record str par ordijal75
 74 per liter
 jabaki dilli main petrol 79
 31 and diesel 71
 34 rupee prati litre
 Whereas Petrol 71 in Delhi in May 2014
 41 rupee prati litre miltaa tha
 The price of diesel is 56
 71 rupee prati litre thi
 Apparently, the impact of continuously rising oil prices is coming in the form of inflation on everyday things, but the opposition is still not successful in making it an issue
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ke baagi netaa or purv kendriya mantri yashavanth sinha ne kaha ki samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki petrol-dijal ke bade daamon ko lekar congress sahit vipaksh sadak par kyon nahin utar rahaa he?2
 During the election campaign in August 2013 on the rupee ground, Narendra Modi said in Rajkot - both the Indian rupee and Manmohan Singh have lost their voice
 aaj rupaya apni mrityu shayya par he or antim saansen gin rahaa he
 It needs a doctor
 upie ko nishane par lete hue unhone kaha ki jab upie satta main ai thi to 100 dinon main mudrasphiti kam karne kaa vaada kiya gaya tha par ab to uskaa ulta ho rahaa he
 Significantly, at that time the price of rupee 65 against the dollar
 56 rupee ho gai thi
 After 4 years, on September 4, the value of the rupee hit a historic high against the dollar
 pehali baar rupaya 71
 Reached the level of 41
 modi sarkaar rupee or tel keemton ke halaat ke liye ab antarrashtriya paristhitiyon ko jimmedaar bataa rahi he
 While the fall of the rupee is also affecting other things
 vahiin, yuvaaon kii berogari ke mudde par bhi siyaasi jang chhidi hui he
 3
 dephence deal: agasta-boforce Vs rafel2014 chunaav kii tarah 2019 se pehle bhi desh main dephence deal main ghotaale ke aarope charchaa main hai
 Then there was the discussion of agustawestland and Bofors and now Rafael
 rahul gandhiki aguwai main congress ne rafel ke mudde par modi sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha khol rakhaa he or sidhe piem modi par aarope laga rahe hai
 With the help of this issue, the Congress is all set to enter the 2019 elections
 4
 What happened to Lokpal? The main demand of Anna movement against Manmohan government was to create Lokpal for prevention of corruption
 2014 ke chunaav prachaar main piem modi ne is mudde ko uthaaya or kaha ki sarkaar main aate hi kaale dhan par roak ke liye kanoon banaaenge or videshon se kaala dhan laakar desh ke eemaandaar logon main baanta jayega
 Modi had also criticized the Congress's claim of giving credit to Rahul Gandhi for passing the Lokpal bill and said that the Congress itself is steeped in corruption
 aaj modi sarkaar ke 4 saal baad bhi lokapal kii niyukti nahin ho saki he
 Kharge, who is a member of the Lokpal Selection Board on behalf of the Congress, is constantly boycotting the meetings
 supreme court ne modi sarkaar ko notice jari kar lokapal kii niyukti nahin hone ko lekar sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Similarly, efforts to bring back black money from abroad are also not getting any special success, it is increasing the difficulty of Modi government before 2019
 haalanki congress in muddon ko dhardaar tareeke se uthaa nahin pai he
 At the grassroots level, the Congress is yet to find much success in picking up against Modi and creating an atmosphere

 Stand on Kashmir and Pakistan In the 2014 election campaign, Narendra Modi and BJP had prominently raised cases of terrorism and cross-border ceasefire violations in Kashmir
 yahaan tak har shahid jawan ke badale 10 sir katkar laane jaise chunavi naare die gaye the
 Today the situation in Kashmir remains the same
 oparation olout main 200 se adhik aatankiyon ke maare jane ke baavjood kashmir main abhi 300 se adhik aatanki sakriy hai jo ki pichley 10 saal main sabase adhik aankada hai
 Despite the appointment of the interlocutor on Kashmir, no party appears on the negotiating table
 kashmir ko lekar modi ke sur bhi badal gaye hai or atal bihari vaajapeyi kii niti 'jamhuriyat, kashmiriat or insaaniyat' par chalane kii baat karne lage hai
 Incidents of ceasefire violation from across the border also did not seem to stop
 sirf isi saal pakistan kii ore se sangharshaviram ulanghan kii 1000 se adhik ghatnaayen hui hai
 Even after the coming of Imran Khan's government in Pakistan, there does not seem to be a period of harsh statements
 iske alaava mob linching, essi / asti act, mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh ke maamalon or yuvaaon kii berogari kaa mudda bhi siyaasi jang kaa aadhaar bane hue hai
 a chaotic situation arose in the Karnataka Assembly on Monday when a ruling Congress MLA had a dispute with the Speaker of the Assembly
 ve jedies ke do sadasyon ke saath adhyaksh kii kursi ke paas aakar virodh pradarshan karne lage
 Later, an MLA was thrown out of the house through marshals

 apane kariyar main sau se zyada filmein kar chukin juhi chawla pehali baar kisi film main negative kirdaar main najar aane vaali hai
 He is in the role of a leader in 'gulab Gang' directed by Soumik Sen
 film main unka muqabla maadhuri dikshit se he
 Excerpts from the conversation with Juhi: Tell us about Gulab Gang? This is a common masala film
 hamaari is film main purush paatr bhi hai
 The film is set against the backdrop of the village
 isamen sandesh bhi he
 It speaks of women empowerment
 auraton ke khilaaf hone vaale atyaachaar ke khilaaf baat karti he
 Girls should be given good education and good upbringing
 is film main maine negative shed vaali politician kaa role kiya he
 How did you get ready for the role of the politician and that too negative? When Soumik came to me with the offer of this film, i felt that his mind was spoiled
 maine saaf-saaf kah diya ki yah role aapane mujhe dhyaan main rakhkar nahin likhaa he
 Why would i do a film like this? i asked him to bring me the role and script again by keeping me in mind, then i will think
 do teen hafte baad role ko soft karke unhone mujhe sunaaya, to mujhe laga ki kirdaar main to kuch dam hi nahin rah gaya
 Then i felt that i messed up a good thing
 or maine unase kaha ki main film karuungi, to puraani script vaali
 Then after several days of interaction with the director, i felt that the script, the characters of it, if i and Madhuri played them well together, then the film would be something else
 kya aapako lagata he ki aapke phans negative role main aapako pasand karenge?majhe bhi aisa hi laga tha ki log mujh par hansege or meraa majaak udaayenge
 But when Soumik explained the character to me in detail, my confidence increased
 meraa itnaa daawa he ki log pehali baar ek alag tarah ke villen ko parde par dekhengen
 Negative characters are very much liked, which is why you chose this role? i was not offered the character of Rajjo
 rajjo ke kirdaar kaa ofer to maadhuri dikshit ko mila tha
 i fulfilled the offer that i received
 isamen kisi par bhi baari padane kii baat nahin he
 To tell the truth, i was afraid that people would like me or not
 lekin mujhe khushi he ki trailor aane ke baad log mujhe pasand kar rahe hai
 i was afraid that people should not say what kind of dialogue it is speaking? What was the experience of playing a politician? It has not been easy because i had never played such a character before
 
 iske liye maine kai mahila netaaon se prerana lee
 They have closely observed and tried to adopt their manorism
 saumik kii madad se main apane kirdaar ko nibhaa pai
 Soumik's first film is, How did you trust him completely? Soumik has written the script of this film
 iske dialog likhe hai
 The film is also decorated with music
 iske alaava unhen filmon kii bahut acchhee jaankaree he
 Now such a person is not a good director, it cannot happen
 unhone nari shashaktikaran ko lekar kaaphi research kii he
 How was the experience working with Madhuri? Madhuri is the best co-actor
 vanderphul experions rahaa
 People will compare you with Madhuri? There will be no comparison
 main to yahaan villen hum
 i did not want to dance in this film
 in dinon bhrasht system ke khilaaf andolan ke jariye yani ki bina hathiyaar ke ladaai ho rahi he jabaki gulab gang main danda najar aa rahaa he?ham apni film main dikhaa rahe hai ki system se ladane ke liye aapako system main janaa padegaa
 How do you choose films now? i want to be a part of good films
 main yah nahin dekhati ki film main main heroin hum yaa nahin
 Who are your favorite directors? i always enjoyed working with directors like Yash Chopra, Aziz Mirza, Mahesh Bhatt

 It remains to be seen how close the real numbers are to these so-called exit poles
 umr ne apane party ke achche pradarshan kaa bharosa jataayaa
 On the question of the possibility of cooperating with BJP in the formation of the next government, Omar said that given the bjp's stand on the issues that are important for the people of the state, it is unthinkable to tie up with this party for the National Conference
 
 unhone kaha, bhaajapa (chunaav prachaar ke dauraan) anuchhed 370 par chup rahi, lekin vah ise lekar apane rukh se peeche nahin hati he, usne ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid mudde par apana rukh nahin choda he, samaan naagarik samhita par apane rukh se peeche nahin hati he
 Till now our Prime Minister is silent on the issue of forced conversions in some parts of the country
 umr ne kaha ki neshnal conference or duusari partiyon ke bich chunaav ke baad gathbandhan ke liye koi baatcheet nahin hui he
 Omar said, the National Conference has not had any talks with BJP or PDP or Congress either
 twitor par bharat ratna ke liye purv pradhamanantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke naam kaa samarthan karne ko lekar sawaal puche jane par umr ne kaha ki ise bhaajapa ke kareeb jane ke taur par nahin dekha janaa chahie
 He said, can anyone really believe that a tweet will create an alliance? Please do not mean anything else
 umr ne kaha ki unhone vaajapeyi ko desh kaa sarvocch naagarik sammaan dene kaa samarthan twitor par kiya, kyonki 25 disambar ko unka janmdin he
 He said that he had a lot of respect for Vajpayee in his mind and said, it would be appropriate for the present government to recognize the contribution of Vajpayee Sahab by giving him Bharat Ratna

 ye bhi padhein- lords test se pehle sachin kii kohli ko salaah- 'dil kii suno'1986 main mili thi pehali jeet1986 main bhartiya team jab england daure par gai thi, to pehle hi test match main lords ke maidan par aisi aitihaasik jeet mil jaaegi yah kisi ne nahin sochaa tha
 The win was led by Kapil Dev
 kapil dev kii captaini main team india ne david gower kii english team ko 5 wicket se maat di thi
 In that match, Dilip Vengsarkar's century and bowling of Kapil Dev and Chetan Sharma played a key role in the team's victory
 28 saal baad varsh 2014 main bharat ne phir kiya kamalsaal 1986 main pehali jeet hasil karne ke baad bharat ko duusari jeet ke liye 28 saal tak intjaar karnaa padaa
 In 2014, Team India, captained by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, defeated Alastair Cook's team by 95 runs at Lord's

 They kept flying in the air for 6 hours in a state of drunkenness
 us vakt 23 saal ke rahe jaiswal kehete hai, 'ab to bhaang pine kii baat sochakar hi ghabara jaataa hum
 'pakoras, laddus, kulfi and chillai are heavily colored during Holi with a drink made from the juice extracted by grinding the leaves and buds of the hemp plant
 shahari yuva fancy partiyon, geet-sangeet, nrity, sharaab or swaadisht vyanjanon ke saath rangon kaa yah tyohaar manaate hai
 Ritika Chopra (23) shared her experience somewhat, 'three years ago i drank two glasses of cold on Holi and yet i did not feel anything, so i drank a bottle of beer
 uske baad to jo hua
 
 
 i was lying on the grass and shivering
 mere gharavaale mujhe lekar bahut zyada dar gaye the'
 She says, 'I was trying to say something, but words were not coming out of my mouth
 mujhe aisa lag rahaa tha, jaise main coffin box main hum or kisi ne meraa munh band kar rakhaa he
 Eventually Ritika was put to sleep in the room and after waking up 10 hours later she came to know the effect of cannabis
 holi kaa lutf lene ke liye thodi maatra main bhaang kaa seven majaa lene ke lihaaj se thik he, lekin adhik maatra main bhaang kaa seven karne se bachanaa chahie or dusron ke bahekaave main nahin aana chahie
 Mohit Kapoor had not spoken to his friend for a month, who had given him cannabis fraudulently
 mohit kehete hai, 'main ab bhi us pal ko yaad karke kaanp jaataa hum ki bhaang kaa seven karne ke baad hosh main rahane ke liye mujhe ghadon thanda pani apane upar daalana padaa tha or maine aadha jaar achaar kha liya tha
 In Hindi cinema, cannabis intake is depicted in many ways in the songs of Holi
 'jai-jai shivashankar', 'rang barase bhiige chunar vaali', 'soni-soni akhiyon vaali', 'madhubala' jaise geeton main kalakaaron ko bhaang ke nashe main dhutt manamaujee kii tarah dikhaaya gaya he
 So have fun on this Holi, but definitely avoid using excessive quantity of cannabis

 One of the reasons why medical treatment is very expensive in the country is that many types of health checkups are very expensive
 iske liye koi regulation nahin he
 The Modi government, which controls the prices of medicines, is expected to bring some regulations for this as well
 shuukravaar ko pesh hone vaale bajet main kya vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman, is disha main koi kadam uthaaengi? yah unke bajet kaa pitara khulne ke baad hi pataa chalegaa
 What is the reason One of the most expensive health checkups is expensive because most of such checkups are in the private sector and there is no regulation to fix their prices
 log iske liye sarkari swasthya kendron ke bharose nahin rah sakate, kyonki vahaan lambii line hoti he
 At present, a large population of India is so deprived and resourceless that it is not able to afford the luxurious and very expensive treatment and checkups etc
 of private hospitals
 sabase chintajanak baat he ki yah he ki shaharon ke mukaable gaanvon main ilaaj, jaanch or dawaaon kaa kharch zyada teji se badha he
 The fees for health checkups, therapy and counseling have also increased sharply
 magar swasthya kshetra ko lekar koi niamak na hone ke kaaran is par koi niyantran nahin paaya ja sakaa he
 Except for complicated checkups, the fees for pathology and radiology testing are also falling on patients' pockets

 Demand for health services and facilities is increasing rapidly in rural areas along with cities
 nijee kshetra isi maang kaa bharpoor phayda uthaa rahaa he
 Heavy robbery continues in the name of health check, in spite of all this, there is no regulator in the health sector, who can fix the minimum price of any healthcare
 kya kar sakati hai vitt mantriudyog chambar fikki ne maang kii he ki inakam tex act 1961 ke section 80 di ke tahat milane vaale priventive health chekup ke liye milane vaali tex chhot maujuuda 5,000 prati vyakti se badhaakar 20,000 prati vyakti tak kiya jaae
 Apart from this, the industry chamber has also demanded to provide deduction of deduction of 10 thousand rupees per employee annually in health checkups sponsored by companies
 iske alaava jo sabase jaruri baat he, vah yah ki tamaam tarah ke chekup ke keemat niyantran ko lekar bhi sarkaar koi elaan kar sakati he
 Everyone will be eagerly waiting for the announcements of the Finance Minister in the health sector, as it is a matter related to every family in the country
