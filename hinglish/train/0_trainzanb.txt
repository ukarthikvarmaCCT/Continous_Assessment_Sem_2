 kejariwal ne kaha ki hamalaa mere upar nahin dilli kii janata par hua he, agar mujh par hamalaa hota he to zimmedaari bijepi sarkaar kii he
 Saying this, Kejriwal has also sought resignation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 piem modi kii taanaashaahee ke khilaaf desh uthaa rahaa he aawajakejariwal ne kaha ki hamalavar kii patni ne kaha ki uskaa pati modi ji ke khilaaf kuch sun nahin saktaa
 Therefore, this attack has been conducted so that those who speak against Modi should be scared
 kejariwal ne kaha ki is hamalavar ke jariye sandesh dene kii koshish kii ja rahi he ki modi ke khilaaf bolne vaale ko choda nahin jayega
 These are signs of a dictator, but i am not afraid
 mujhe khushi he ki desh ke log bhi awaz uthaa rahe hai 
 Kejriwal said that many leaders of the country have raised their voice against this attack
 desh piem modi kii taanaashaahee ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaa rahaa he
 People could not repay even after losing their lives, Ahsan Kejriwal said that the attack was made because they have problems with our work
 hamane bijli, pani, shiksha or swasthya main jo kaam kiya he usase ye dar gaye hai
 The way our work is moving forward, the base of these parties is slipping, which they are unable to tolerate
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki main janata kaa ahsaan apni jaan ganvaakar bhi nahin chukaa saktaa
 My life is nothing before the people of Delhi
 kejariwal ne kaha ki jab tak jinda hum tab tak dilli kii shiksha, swasth vyavastha ko aage badhaata rahoonga
 Why does Pakistan want to make Modi again PM? Kejriwal said that the way the Prime Minister is insulting the army, it has not happened till date
 kejariwal ne kaha ki maine modi ji or pakistan ke sambandhon ke bare main sawaal kiye or poocha ki kyon pakistan dobaaraa narendra modi ko pradhanmantri bananaa chahta he
 a dangerous game is going on between Modi and Pakistan

 Explain that Delhi Police told that the slapping youth named Suresh works as a junk and is a supporter of Aam Aadmi Party
 vah aap kii reliyon or baithkon main bataur aayojak kaam karata he
 Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said, do Modi and Amit Shah now want Kejriwal killed? Whose morale could not be broken by putting all the power for five years, could not be defeated in the election, now you want to remove it from the way, Cairo! This is Kejriwal's era
 kya modi or amit shah ab kejariwal kii hatya karwaanaa chaahate hai?5 saal sari taaqat lagaakar jiskaa manobal nahin tod sake, chunaav main nahin haraa sake
 
 ab use raste se is tarah hataanaa chaahate ho cairo!ye kejariwal hi tumhaara kaal he
 - Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) May 4, 2019 It is worth mentioning that Arvind Kejriwal was doing a road show on Saturday in Moti Nagar area during the campaign of AAP candidate Brijesh Goyal from New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency, when red t-shirt a young man dressed Kejriwal climbed on the jeep and slapped him
 ek taraf aam aadmi party ne ise sajeesh qaraar diya he to vahiin police ne bataaya ki hamalavar suresh ke anusaar vah party ke netaaon ke vyavhaar se pareshaan tha
 It's appalling that the Delhi Police knew of the impending attack on the CM and it did not try to stop it
 Clear that it’s a conspiracy and is being controlled from the top
 cms security is the job of Delhi Police and they are under oath to ensure it
 Then why this callousness?https: / / t

 unhone twit kar kaha, dilli ke mukhyamantri kii suraksha modi sarkaar ke adheen he, lekin kejariwal kaa jivan sabase asurakshit he
 He said that repeated attacks and then police cries, what intrigue is behind this? If you have the courage, come forward and strike others not by making weapons

 My best friend Narbhaslal was fully convinced that his merit would come to the country only when he would be a participant in politics
 kaaphi soch vichaar karne ke baad aakhirkaar vah bhaajapa ke sadsy ban gaye
 He came to my house with sweets to share this happiness
 mere moonh main laddu thunsate hue bole kii bahut badi khushkhabari he
 i asked if the son was promoted? He said, 'no man, the company he worked in was getting staffed, so he was banished from there yesterday'
 to beti kii shaadi tay hui hogi? kuch chidhate hue bole, ‘nahin yaar
 i do not decide to get married when i find someone qualified for employment
 ’ khayr maine puch liya ki to khushkhabari kya he? narbhasalal chahakate hue bole, ‘yaar mujhe bhaajapa kaa sadsyta mil gaya he na‘
 While congratulating me, i asked that why did you become a member of BJP, why did you not become another party? All i had to ask was that Narbhaslal started
 unhone bataanaa shuru kiya yaa yon kahen ki unki katha is tarah se hai
 'BJP is not only the country but the world's largest political party
 patna kaa jo golghar he na usase bhi bada
 The widest four-line, six-line road should also be kept facing
 lanbaa itnaa ki baar re baap, badkaa-badkaa railgadee bhi iske saamne chota dikhataa he
 There is one leader each in the party
 lanka main jo sabase chota uu unchaas haath ke jaisaa puraa vyavastha he
 Whosoever has not heard his name, he can become a mantri-sentry in this party
 so hamaara bhi yahaan puraa chance he koi na koi bada pad milbe karegaa
 The second most important thing that has drawn me to the BJP is the humiliation of garlanding the leaders of another party
 ab congress main jane kaa kya phayda tha
 Which leader of the BJP would have gone there? Gariyata? There are only two-four leaders here, that is also not worth thriving
 vaajapeyi, adwani yaa joshi hi le-dekar hai
 But to tell the truth, even the Congressmen do not want to gargle with them
 vaajapeyi to ab rahe nahin lekin baanki donon netaa aise hai jo party main hi gariyaaye bina dhakiya die gaye hai
 What is the use of abusing them? But in the BJP, we can free all the big leaders of the Congress
 nehru hon yaa indira yaa phir rajeev yaa soniyaan, gariyaane laayak sabhi hai
 Rahul is not even fit to garrison him
 haa kabhi-kabhi jab koi na mili to use bhi gariyaa kar apni baat kah sakate hai
 The third thing is the reason why i became a member of the BJP is to use its modern technology
 bas miss kaal do or ho gaye sadsy
 Neither must go to the party office nor is there any compulsion to roam behind
 jatke main miss kaal do or ban jaao sadsy
 Even if you do not have your own phone, you can become a member by giving a missed call from someone else's phone
 isi facility kii vajah se aaj yah bhi sambhav he ki kai rajya main to party utana vot bhi hasil nahin kar paati he jitne kii sadsy hote hai
 The fourth biggest reason is that becoming a member of this party is a virtuous act like bathing the Ganges
 yahaan aae nahin ke puraane saare paap dhul gaye
 Not seen is the leader from Bengal who was earlier in TMC
 us par bhrashtachar kaa aarope tha, kuch din tiemasi main hi rahata to jail chalaa jaataa
 But it became very sacred as soon as it entered the BJP
 yahaan par ek baat jaruri he yah bataanaa kii chidambaram videsh main pard kar jhuththe apan baap kaa paisa dubo diya
 If he had gone to BJP, he would have survived
 rah gaya congress main so sad rahaa he jail main
 This is called not using intelligence
 or wo karnataka bala koi shiv he vah bhi pahunch gaye sahi jagah par
 If i joined the BJP, i would not have been a minister or a fool
 khayr maine tokate hue poocha ki acha narbhasalal ye bataao kii samaajawaadee party, rajd yaa vampanthi dal yahaan jane kii kyon nahin soche? narbhasalal bhadak gaye
 Said, 'do you think i deserve a regional party? hamaara stechar neshnal politics kaa he
 Anyway, who will climb on the cycle of Samajwadi Party in today's time, when the bullet train is going to run in the country
 vaise left main jane kaa bhi sochaa tha
 It was almost reached there but the landing went wrong
 jaise chandrayan, chand par pahunchate-pahunchate rah gaya vaise hi vampanthi banate-banate main rah gaya
 Actually, before going there, went to pray to God and after applying tilak on his forehead and went to his office with Prasad in his hand, the people there pushed me
 vaise bhi vampanthi bekaar hi he
 He is like a mosquito that flies near the ears while sleeping at night but does not bite
 haa yah baat sahi he ki kaatane vaala party mamata banerjee kaa he lekin bechaari khude dari hui he
 So the BJP left only one party, so we have become BJP

 sibiai ke special jaj brijagopal harimohan loya kii maut ke baad kii prakriyaaon ko lekar kairavaan patrika main jo sawaal uthe hai, uske samanaantar indian express kii report aa gai he
 In some places, the express report cuts off the caravan report, in some places new doubts arise about the express report
 acha hota ki is maamle par supreme court sangyaan letaa or aisi jaanch samiti banati jo sabase pehle jaj loya ke parivaaravaalon main system or samaaj ke prati bharosa paidaa kare
 The people of the family will have to come out and take this risk because the matter started from them only
 kairavaan patrika ne express kii report par kuch nahin kaha he
 Recently, be it the case of Rajesh and Nupur Talwar or the case of Ashok, the bus conductor of Ryan School, the lesson is that media trials should be avoided
 chunki maine pehali baar kairavaan par report kii he isliye mujhe ek baar or express kii report kaa saar aapke saamne rakhana chahie
 The purpose of my prime time was that no one should be afraid to speak up
 indian express ko bhi parivaar ke sadasyon se baat karne main safalataa nahin mili he
 It is therefore necessary that such an inquiry committee should be formed before which the family has confidence in going and the media trial should be stopped
 sawaal uth gaye hai jinase sambandhit dastauez or sawaal samiti ke saamne hi rakhen jaaen varna ek ek saboot ko lekar tivi par bahes hogi to vahi saboot kabhi sahi lagegaa or kabhi galat
 The first report of Caravan came on 21 November, Indian Express on 27 November
 chah dinon kii charchaa ke baad agar parivaar khul kar bolne kaa saahas nahin juta paa rahaa he to chintaa kii baat he
 Are they scared or is there any talk within the family
 jo log jaanch agenciyon kii harkaton, lambii kanoonee prakriyaaon se guzaren hai wo jaanate hai ki us taraf jane ke kya anjaam hote hai
 Therefore their fear can be understood
 magar unhen pataa hona chahie ki inhen sab ke bich aam se aam log system se ladate hai or insaaf bhi pate hai
 Niranjan Takle of Caravan has written that 80 days after the death of Judge Loya, he demanded a probe, did not approve on 18 February 2015
 aisa nahin tha ki parivaar ne teen saal baad chuppi todi he, chup to ab bhi he, bolne kaa saahas nahin juta paa rahaa he
 Judge Loya's wife and son did not talk to Niranjan Takle of Caravan, writing that he feared death
 express ke vivek deshpandey or maurya jaanwalkar se bhi maa bete ne baat nahin kii
 If mother and son are not talking with any fear then it is a matter of concern
 kairavaan patrika ke niranjan taakale ne jaj loya ke pita harikishan loya se november 2016 main mulaakaat kii thi
 Then he said that i am 85 years old, not afraid of death, but the girls and their children are worried about their lives
 express ne likhaa he ki harikishan loya, anuraadhaa biyani, sarita madhane kaa phone switch of, wo ghar par bhi nahin mili
 That is, those who talked to the caravan reporter could not contact the express reporters
 ghar par nahin mili
 Anuradha Biyani has given a video statement and is the only on record statement in this case
 kairavaan kii report bahan anuraadhaa biyani, sarita maanadhane or pita harikishan ke bayaan par aadhaarit he
 The Express has spoken to Srinivasa Loya, brother of Harikshan Loya, Justice Loya's uncle, who says his niece Anuradha has raised questions about the judge's death
 chachaa shrinivas loya ne enditivi se bhi baat karte hue kaha ki unhen yahi bataaya gaya tha ki postmortem ho chukaa he or shav ko baks main rakhkar nagpur se bheja ja chukaa he
 We were waiting for the dead body and when it arrived, there was no one else who was the ambulance driver
 yahi baat anuraadhaa biyani ne kahi he
 The name of the person who signed the body for autopsy after the post-mortem in the Caravan and Express reports
 prashanth rathi he
 Prashant Rathi has refused to talk on camera, he was tried by ndtv's Manas and Saurav Gupta
 prashanth rathi ne maanas se jo kaha or express se jo kaha usamen ek bahut bada antar he
 Prashant told ndtv's Manas that my uncle had reported the death of Judge Loya around six o'clock in the morning and that i immediately reached out to assist the family at the time of mourning
 dow prashanth rathi ne maanas se kaha ki ye ankal aurangabad main rahete hai or jaj loya ke kazin hai
 Rathi did not tell Manas that he had warts, used Uncle and cousin in English
 naam bhi nahin bataaya ki koun hai
 When we talk to the Rathi Express, it is clear that Moussa got a call and his name is Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia
 unka phone aata he ki unke kazin jaj loya meditrina aspataal main bhartee hai or mujhe loya kii madad ke liye kehete hai
 When i reach the hospital, the doctor says that he has died
 yah baat main apane ankal ko bataata hum
 Uncle asks me to take care of formalities
 ab aapane dekha ki prashanth rathi ek reporter se kehete hai ki ankal kaa phone aata he ki 6 baje loya kii maut ho gai he
 Loya tells a reporter that Loya is recruiting, help him
 aspataal jaakar pataa chalata he ki loya mar chuke hai
 Here is another question
 nagpur main doctor prashanth rathi hi akele sab manage kar rahe the to kya unase loya ke parivaar ke kisi kareebi ne baar-baar baat kii, jaanane ke liye ki kya ho rahaa he, shav kahaan le jayega
 Can Dr
 Rathi tell who was told by the family that the body will go to Gategaon, not Latur, to Mumbai
 dow prashanth rathi ne camere par baat karne se inkaar kar diya
 It is not clear how close Rathi's warts were to Jakotia judge Loya, was he talking to his father, was Anuradha talking to Biyani? Dr Prashant Rathi told Manas of NDTV that he had not seen the body of Judge Loya
 unhen ek chadar main lapeta gaya tha
 They just signed on
 kairavaan kii report main bahan anuraadhaa biyani nagpur main kisi rishtedaar kii baat karti hai magar naam nahin bataati hai
 There is no mention of Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia in their conversation, nor the name of Judge Loya's father
 prashanth rathi ne postmortem report main sin karte hue khud ko mritak kaa chachera bhai bataaya he
 From the father's side
 magar unke mausa jaj loya ko apana bhai bataate hai
 a wart's brother was like a wart
 to rathi ne khud ko loya kaa chachera bhai kaise bataa diya
 If i am right then Rathi Loya and Jakotia's nephew
 kya rukmesh pannalaal jakotia jaj loya kii patni, pita or bahan anuraadhaa ke sampark main the
 It is not clear from the report of the express that it was decided to send the dead body to Gategaon in place of Mumbai
 patni sharmila loya ko phone gaya tha to kya unhen pataa tha ki shav gaategaanv jayega, mumbai nahin aayega
 If his family lives around Latur, it may be a practical decision
 magar yahi nahin pataa chal rahaa he ki nagpur se gaategaanv le jane kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 This will be clear only when Sharmila Loya herself comes before the media and clarifies her position
 kairavaan ne yah to likhaa he ki maut kii soochna kaa phone patni ko bhi gaya, bahanon ko bhi or pita ko bhi
 Sister Anuradha says that there were some bards on the phone who call themselves judges, their call came
 bahan sarita bhi bataati hai ki barde naam ke jaj ne phone kiya tha
 The Indian Express report clears Barde's name
 ve jaj barde hai
 Judge Barde has been called a local judge in the report of the Express and his full name is Judge Vijay Kumar Barde
 express main he ki hoicourt ke nagpur bench ke dipti register rupesh rathi or barde justise loya ko dande aspataal lekar jate hai car main
 It is written in Caravan that two judges take Judge Loya in auto
 express main likhaa he ki do jaj car main jaj loya ko lekar jate hai
 Justice Sunil Shukre has said that Judge Barde was driving the car himself
 hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se justise gawai ne kaha ki ve us vakt nagpur main senior administrative justise the
 He also says from the Express that he, as a senior administrative judge, called him and then he reached Mediterina Hospital with his fellow judge Sunil Shukre
 apane dryver kaa bhi intazaar nahin kiya
 Both lived about a mile from Ravi Bhavan
 jaj ko lekar aspataal le jane main local jaj, dipti register, jaj kulkarani or jaj modak bhi the
 Justice Gavai has also told Sunil Singh that a total of five rooms were booked in Ravi Bhavan but at night all three preferred to stay in one room
 kyonki sabhi kii vaapasi kaa tikat ek hi saath kaa tha or agali subah mumbai lautnaa tha
 The two judges from Mumbai did not accompany the body because they were shocked by the death of the friend
 kairavaan main anuraadhaa biyani ne kaha he ki donon jaj dedh maheene tak parivaar se nahin mili
 Now you see that when Judge Loya's sisters questioned, Judge Sahiban was silent
 ab parivaar ke log chup hai to jaj sahiban apni baat rakh rahe hai
 The investigation has not been announced yet
 jaj loya ke bete ne tab ke chif justise ko patr likhaa tha ki mujhe dar he ki ye netaa mere parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 i do not have the strength to fight them
 hamaari zindagi khatare main he
 The son of a judge writes a letter to the Chief Justice
 maut ke 80 din baad
 This letter has been shown by Caravan magazine in its video
 is patr ke baad kya parivaar ko suraksha di gai, kyon nahin di gai? Manas of NDTV has stated in its report that there was no car designate for any judge in Ravi Bhavan
 yah baat ravi bhawan ke kuch staff ne maanas ko naam naa lene ke shart par bataai
 It should also be seen that the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly session was about to begin around the event
 kya us vakt ravi bhawan main koi ambulance thi
 All this investigation will reveal, not through media trials
 express main likhaa he ki jaj loya ne 4 baje seene main dard kii shikaayat kii lekin car se nikatom aspataal pahunchane main paune paanch baj jate hai
 What should take 45 minutes to cover the distance of three kilometers in the morning
 iskaa jawaab maaloom nahin he
 Now the question arises when Judge Loya got chest pain
 iske alag alag varjan hai
 In Caravan, Niranjan Takle has written that he had chest pain at 12:30
 anuraadhaa biyani ke anusaar donon jajon ne yah baat parivaar ko bataai thi
 According to Caravan, the post-mortem report said that there was pain at 4 o'clock and death at 6
15 o'clock
 indian express ko justise bhushan gawai ne bataaya ki jaj loya kii kareeb 4 baje tabiyat kharaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai from NDTV has said that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at 3:30 pm
 justise bhushan gawai ne hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se baat kii he
 In this context, Anuradha Biyani's statement becomes important that both the judges said that there was a chest problem at 12:30
 matlab justise modak or justise kulkarani ne
 But according to Justice Gavai, both went to the hospital in the morning with Judge Loya
 postmortem kii report kaa mahatv he magar aap jaanate hai ki is desh main postmortem kii report ke saath kya kya khilwaad ho jate hai
 This does not mean that this is what happened in this case, i am just referring for reference
 koun sahi bol rahaa he yah to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Do not doubt anyone unnecessarily
 sunil singh ne jab justise gawai se baat kii to ek or sawaal kaa jawaab mila
 According to him, only Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni went with Judge Loya
 gawai ke mutabik pehali baar ve shaadi main jaj loya se mili the
 According to him, the three people went out of the ceremony to eat Gokul Peth Paan
 teenon kaa matlab jaj loya, justise kulkarani or justise modak paan khaane gaye the
 Justice Gavai was called by the Deputy Registrar at six in the morning to inform Judge Loya's death, and then he went to the Meditrina Hospital where Justice Modak, Justice Kulakarni, Judge Barde and Deputy Registrar were present
 justise gawai isiu main gaye the or unke sharir par kahin koon ke nishaan nahin the
 Notice of death is everywhere at six o'clock
 jaj loya kii ek or bahan sarita ne kairavaan ke niranjan taakale se kaha he ki paanch baje jaj barde kaa phone aayaa tha ki brijagopal kii maut ho chuki he
 Whether a difference in time can be doubted, at least not in a media trial
 indian express kii report ke baad isiji kii chhapi hui tasviir ko lekar thodi sansani ho gai
 Brijgopal Lohia is written in the ECG report above and the date below is 30 November
 jabaki maut ek november ko hui he
 Does the ECG machine cause such a lapse
 aspataal ne is bare main kaha he ki 30 november kii jo taarikh dikh rahi he, wo takniki kharabi ho sakati he
 We re-calibrate our machine every three months so that such omissions do not happen, but sometimes such disturbances occur in between
 ham apane tathy par kaayam hai
 The ECG took place on December 1
 aspataal ne baad main express ko bataaya he jise express ne apni website par chapa he
 Whether there was a compliment on the report on that day, on 30 November, all this will be known only by investigation
 kuch logon ne isiji ko dekhakar kahana shuru kar diya ki isiji saamaanya he
 We spoke to two doctors but keep in mind a warning
 beemaari kaa pataa ek report se nahin chalata he, or ek report se bhi chalata he
 All these things should be under scrutiny, but now Caravan and Express have printed different versions, then we talked to two doctors
 anuraadhaa ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki dande haspital ke doctoron or karmchaariyon ne kya chikitsa kii gai iskaa koi vivaran dene se haspital ne inkaar kar diya, vahiin dande hospital ke nideshak pinaak dande ne express se baat kii he or byora diya
 You will see that most of the questions are being shared about the activities after death, there is similarity in many places, there is difference in many places
 koi bhi sawaal is baat ko thos rup se uthta nahin dikhaa ki kya jaj loya kii hatya kii gai hogi
 Many big judges were present during the post-mart
 iskaa vivaran kai tarah se sahi sabit hota he
 We had asked the question of whose decision the post-mart was, but you will get the answer to this question only through the process of law
 anuraadhaa biyani ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki doctor hone ke kaaran wo jaanati hai ki postmortem ke dauraan khun nahin nikalataa or biyani ne dobaaraa postmortem kii maang kii thi lekin vahaan ikatthe loya ke doston or sahakarmiyon ne unhen hatotsahit kiya ki yah kehete hue ki maamle ko or jatil banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Many officials say that blood does not come out at the time of postmart but our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar has given forensic expert Dr
 ke si sharma se baat kii
 He said the postmortem also happens without informing the family
 postmart hone ke baad kai baar kapadon main rakt lag jaataa he jiske kai kaaran hote hai
 The comments express or kairavaan main ek or kirdaar he
 Ishwar Bahati kairavaan main ise aresas kaa bataaya gaya he
 In the Express, these were Judge Loya's friends, Dr
 baheti kaa bhai bataaya gaya he or jaj loya ishwar baheti ke sampark main the
 But Baheti has not talked to Express and Caravan
 kam se kam unhen media se sampark karnaa chahie ki unke paas jaj loya kaa phone kaise aayaa, wo maut ke teen chaar dinon baad phone lekar kaise parivaar ke paas pahunch gaye, kya yah sahi he ki phone se data uda diya gaya tha, ek hi esemes bachaa tha
 Supreme Court lawyer Sudeep Srivastava has raised some questions
 bahut tarah ke sawaal hai jo ek duusare se takaraa rahe hai
 Whether the family members have said it will be proved by investigation, or it will be unilaterally dismissed from here or there through the statement
 mobile tower se pataa chal saktaa he ki koun jaj kahaan tak gaye the, koun kisase baat kar rahaa tha, loya ne kise phone kiya, patni ko kis number se phone gaya
 But all this can be revealed only by investigation when the facts and witnesses will be produced
 mere prime time kaa uddeshy yahi tha ki apni baat kehane se kisi ko darana nahin chahie
 Indian Express has also not been successful in talking to family members
 isliye zaruri he ki aisi jaanch samiti bane jiske saamne jane main parivaar ko bharosa ho or media trial band ho
 Questions have arisen related to which the documents and questions should be kept before the committee or else there will be a debate on TV about each evidence, then the same evidence will be considered correct and sometimes false
 kairavaan kii pehali report 21 november ko ai he, indian express kii 27 november ko
 After six days of discussion, if the family is unable to muster the courage to speak openly, then it is a matter of concern
 kya ve dare hue hai yaa parivaar ke bheetar koi baat he
 Those who have gone through the activities of investigative agencies, lengthy legal processes, they know the consequences of going to that side
 isliye unka bhay samajha ja saktaa he
 But they should know that among them all common people fight the system and also get justice
 kairavaan ke niranjan taakale ne likhaa he ki jaj loya kii maut ke 80 dinon baad jaanch kii maang kii thi, 18 farvari 2015 ko lekar manzur nahin hui
 It was not that the family broke the silence after three years, it is still silent, unable to muster the courage to speak
 jaj loya kii patni or bete ne kairavaan ke niranjan taakale se baat nahin kii, likhaa he ki unhen jaan kaa dar he
 The mother-son also did not talk to Vivek Deshpande and Maurya Janwalkar of Express
 agar maa bete kisi dar se baat nahin kar rahe hai to yah chintaa kii baat he
 Niranjan Takle of Caravan magazine met Judge Loya's father Harikishan Loya in November 2016
 tab unhone kaha tha ki 85 saal kaa ho chukaa hum, maut kaa dar nahin, magar bacchiyon or unke bacchon kii jaan kii phikr he
 Express has written that Harikishan Loya, Anuradha Biyani, Sarita Mandhane's phone switch off, they could not be found even at home
 yani jin logon ne kairavaan ke reporter se baat kii un logon se express ke reporter sampark nahin kar sake
 Not found at home anuraadhaa biyani ne video bayaan diya he or is cese main vahi ekmaatr on record bayaan he
 Caravan's report is based on the statements of sister Anuradha Biyani, Sarita Manadhane and father Harikishan
 express ne shrinivas loya, harikishan loya ke bhai, justise loya ke chachaa se baat kii he jo kehete hai ki unki bhatiji anuraadhaa ne jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uthaae hai wo kaaphi ahm hai
 Uncle Srinivas Loya also spoke to NDTV, saying that he was told that the post-mortem had been done and the dead body was kept in the box and sent from Nagpur
 ham shav kaa intazaar kar rahe the or jab pahunchaa to ambulance kaa driver hi tha or koi nahin tha
 This is what Anuradha Biyani has said
 kairavaan or express kii report me postmortem ke baad shav lene ke liye jis vyakti ne hastakshar kiye hai unka naam dow
 Prashant is Rathi
 prashanth rathi ne camere par baat karne se inkaar kar diya he, unase enditivi ke maanas or saurav gupta ne sampark karne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 There is a big difference in what Prashant Rathi said to Manas and what he told the Express
 prashanth ne enditivi ke maanas se kaha ki mere ankal ne subah chah baje ke kareeb jaj loya kii maut kii soochna di or main shok ke samay main parivaar kii sahaayta ke liye turant pahunchaa
 Dr
 Prashant Rathi told Manas that he lives in Uncle Aurangabad and is the cousin of Judge Loya
 rathi ne maanas ko rishta nahin bataaya ki mausa hai, angrezi kaa ankal or kazin istamaal kiya
 The name was not even told who it was
 yahi rathi express se baat karte hai to saaf-saaf kehete hai ki mausa kaa phone aayaa or unka naam rukmesh pannalaal jakotia he
 He gets a call that his cousin Judge Loya is admitted to the Meditrina Hospital and asks me to help Loya
 jab main aspataal pahunchataa hum to doctor bataate hai ki unki maut ho chuki he
 i tell this to my uncle
 ankal mujhe aupchaariktaaon kaa dhyaan rakhane ke liye kehete hai
 Now you see that Prashant Rathi tells a reporter that Uncle's phone call that Loya has died at 6 o'clock
 ek reporter se kehete hai ki loya bhartee hai, unki madad karen
 Going to the hospital, he learns that Loya is dead
 yahaan ek or sawaal he
 In Nagpur, Dr
 Prashant Rathi was the only one managing all, so did someone close to Loya's family repeatedly talk to him, to know what is going on, where the body will be taken
 kya doctor rathi bataa sakate hai ki unase parivaar ke kisne kaha ki shav mumbai nahin, latur se sata gaategaanv jayega
 Dr
 Prashant Rathi refused to speak on camera
 yah saaf nahin he ki rathi ke mausa jakotia jaj loya ke kitne kareebi the, kya ve pita se baat kar rahe the, kya anuraadhaa biyani se baat kar rahe the? dow prashanth rathi ne enditivi ke maanas ko bataaya ki unhone jaj loya ke shav ko nahin dekha tha
 They were wrapped in a sheet
 bas unhone sin kar diya
 In Caravan's report, sister Anuradha Biyani talks about a relative in Nagpur but does not mention the name
 unki baatcheet main rukmesh pannalaal jakotia kaa koi zikr nahin he, na hi jaj loya ke pita ne naam liya he
 Prashant Rathi, signing the post-mortem report, described himself as the cousin of the deceased
 pita ke said se
 But his warts call Judge Loya his brother
 mausa kaa bhai to mausa ke baraabar hua
 So how did Rathi tell herself Loya's cousin
 agar main sahi hum to rathi loya or jakotia ke bhatija lagenge
 Was Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia in touch with Judge Loya's wife, father and sister Anuradha
 express kii report se saaf nahin hota he ki shav mumbai kii jagah latur ke gaategaanv bhejne kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 If wife Sharmila Loya got a call, did she know that the body would go to Gategaon, not to Mumbai
 unka parivaar latur ke aas-paas rahata he to ho saktaa he ki yah vyaavhaarik faisla ho
 But it is not known whose decision it was to move from Nagpur to Gategaon
 yah tabhi saaf hoga jab sharmila loya khud media ke saamne aakar apni sthiti saaf karengi
 Caravan has written that the call for the information of the death went to the wife as well as to the sisters and also to the father
 bahan anuraadhaa ye bataati hai ki phone par koi barde the jo apane ko jaj bataate hai, unka phone aayaa tha
 Sister Sarita also tells that a judge named Barde called
 indian express kii report main barde kaa naam saaf ho jaataa he
 He is Judge Barde
 jaj barde ko express kii report main local jaj kaha gaya he or inkaa puraa naam he jaj vijay kumaar barde
 It is in the express that Rupesh Rathi, Deputy Registrar of Nagpur Bench of High Court and Barde Justice Loya take him to Dande Hospital in a car
 kairavaan main likhaa he ki do jaj aato main jaj loya ko lekar jate hai
 It is written in the express that two judges take Judge Loya in the car
 justise sunil shukre ne kaha he ki jaj barde car khud chalaa rahe the
 Justice Gavai told our colleague Sunil Singh that he was the Senior Administrative Justice in Nagpur at that time
 express se bhi vahi kehete hai ki varisht prashaskeey jaj hone ke naate unhen hi phone kiya or tab ve apane saathi jaj sunil shukre ko lekar meditirina aspatal pahunche
 Did not even wait for my driver
 donon ravi bhawan se ek mile kii duuri par rahete the
 Local judges, deputy registrars, judge Kulkarni and Judge Modak were also there to take the judge to the hospital
 justise gawai ne sunil singh ko yah bhi bataaya he ki ravi bhawan main kul paanch kamare book the magar raat main teenon ne ek hi kamare main rahanaa pansad kiya
 Because everyone's return ticket was the same and was to return to Mumbai the next morning
 mumbai se gaye donon jaj shav ke saath isliye nahin gaye kyonki ve dost kii maut ke sadame main the
 In Caravan, Anuradha Biyani has said that the two judges did not meet the family for a month and a half
 ab aap dekh rahe hai ki jab jaj loya kii bahanon ne sawaal kiya to jaj sahiban chup the
 Now the family members are silent, then Judge Sahiban is speaking
 jaanch kaa elaan abhi tak nahin hua he
 Judge Loya's son wrote a letter to the then Chief Justice saying that i am afraid that these leaders may harm any member of my family
 mere paas inase ladane kii takat nahin he
 Our life is in danger ek jaj kaa betaa chif justise ko patr likhata he
 80 days after death
 yah patr kairavaan patrika ne apane video main dikhaaya he
 After this letter, was the family given protection, why not? enditivi ke maanas ne apni report main kaha he ki ravi bhawan main kisi bhi jaj ke liye koi car desiganet nahin thi
 Some staff members of Ravi Bhavan told Manas on condition of anonymity
 yah bhi dekha janaa chahie ki ghatana ke aasapaas maharashtra vidhansabha kaa satr shuru hone vaala tha
 Was there any ambulance in Ravi Bhavan at that time
 yah sab jaanch se pataa chalegaa, media trial se nahin
 It is written in the express that Judge Loya complained of chest pain at 4 o'clock but it is a quarter past five to reach the nearest hospital by car
 subah ke vakt teen kilometre kaa faasla tay karne main kya 45 minute laganaa chahie
 The answer is not known
 ab sawaal uthta he ki jaj loya ko seene main kab dard hua
 It has different versions
 kairavaan main niranjan taakale ne likhaa he ki saadhe baarah baje seene main dard hua
 According to Anuradha Biyani, both the judges had told this to the family
 kairavaan ke anusaar postmortem report main kaha gaya he ki 4 baje dard hua or sava 6 baje maut hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai told the Indian Express that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at around 4 am
 enditivi se justise bhushan gawai ne kaha he ki saadhe teen baje jaj loya kii tabiyat karaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai has spoken to our colleague Sunil Singh
 is sandarbh main anuraadhaa biyani kaa bayaan mahatvapurn ho jaataa he ki donon jajon ne bataaya ki saadhe baarah baje seene main takalif hui
 Meaning Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni
 magar justise gawai ke anusaar to donon subah ke vakt jaj loya ko lekar aspataal gaye the
 The report of the post-mortem is important but you know what messes with the post-mortem report in this country
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki is cese main yahi hua he, main bas sandarbh ke liye bataa rahaa hum
 Who is saying the right thing will be known only through investigation
 aap bhi kisi par bevajaah shaq na karen
 Another question was answered when Sunil Singh spoke to Justice Gavai
 unke anusaar justise modak or justise kulkarani hi jaj loya ke saath gaye the
 According to Gawai, he met Judge Loya for the first time in marriage
 unke mutabik samaaroh se nikalakar teenon log gokul peth paan khaane gaye the
 The trio meant Judge Loya, Justice Kulakarni and Justice Modak went to eat paan
 justise gawai ko subah chah baje dipti register ne phone kar jaj loya ke maut kii soochna di, or tab ve meditrina aspataal gaye jahaan par justise modak, justise kulkarani, jaj barde or dipti register maujuud the
 Justice Gavai went to the ICU and there were no blood stains on his body
 maut kii soochna har jagah chah baje hai
 Sarita, another sister of Judge Loya, has told Niranjan Takle of Caravan that at five o'clock Judge Barde got a call that Brijgopal had died
 kya samay main antar ko lekar shaq kiya ja saktaa he, kam se kam media trial main nahin hona chahie
 After the report of Indian Express, there was some sensation about the printed picture of ECG
 isiji kii report main upar brijagopal lohia likhaa he or neeche kii taarikh 30 november he
 While the death occurred on November 1
 kya isiji mashin se aisi chook ho jaati he
 The hospital has said about this that the date of November 30 is visible, it may be technical fault
 ham har teen maheene par apni mashin ko ri-calibratt karte hai taaki aisi chook na ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi bich-bich main aisi gadabadi ho jaati he
 We stand by our facts
 isiji disambar ek taarikh ko hui thi
 The hospital later revealed the express, which the Express has published on its website
 kya us rose or bhi report par 30 november kii tarif chhapi thi, ye sab to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Some people started looking at ECG and started saying that ECG is normal
 hamane do doctoron se baat kii lekin ek chetavanee dhyaan main rakhiegaa
 The disease is not detected by a report, and also by a report
 yah sari baaten jaanch ke daayre main honi chahie magar ab kairavaan or express ne alag-alag varjan chaape hai to hamane do doctoron se baat kar lee
 Anuradha has told Caravan that the hospital and doctors at Dande Hospital refused to give any details of what was done, while Pinak Dande, director of Dande Hospital, spoke to the Express and gave details
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar sawaal maut ke baad kii gatividhiyon ko lekar jo soochnaaon kaa aadan pradaan ho rahaa he, usamen kai jagah samanta he, kai jagah antar he
 No question arises concretely as to whether Judge Loya would have been murdered
 postmart ke vakt kai bade jaj maujuud the
 Its description proves to be true in many ways
 hamane yah sawaal kiya tha ki postmart kaa faisla kiskaa tha, lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab aapako kanoon kii prakriya se hi milegaa
 Anuradha Biyani has told Caravan that as a doctor she knows that blood does not come out during the post-mortem and Biyani again demanded a post-mortem but Loya's friends and colleagues gathered there discouraged her saying that the case No need to further complicate
 kai adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki postmart ke samay khun nahin nikalataa lekin hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger ne forensik export dow
 Talked to KC Sharma
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ko suchit kiye bina bhi postmortem ho jaataa he
 After the post-mortem, there are many reasons why blood gets put into clothes due to many reasons
 tippaniyan Express and Caravan have another character
 ishwar baheti
 In the caravan it is described as RSS
 express main inhen jaj loya ke mitra dow
 Baheti's brother is said to be and Judge Loya was in contact with Ishwar Baheti
 magar baheti ne express or kairavaan se baat nahin kii he
 At least they should contact the media about how they got Judge Loya's phone, how he reached the family with the phone three to four days after his death, is it true that the data was blown out of the phone, the same SMS was saved
 supreme court ke vakil sudeep shrivastav ne kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 There are a wide variety of questions that clash with each other
 parivaar ke sadasyon ne jo kaha he kya use jaanch se sabit kiya jayega, yaa phir ekatarfa idhar se yaa udhar se bayaan ke zarie khaarij kar diya jayega
 From the mobile tower, we can know who the judge went to, who he was talking to, whom Loya called, who called the wife from
 magar ye sab to jaanch se hi saamne aa sakegaa jab tathy or gavaahon kii peshi hogi
 Judge Loya's wife and son did not talk to Niranjan Takle of Caravan, writing that he feared death
 express ke vivek deshpandey or maurya jaanwalkar se bhi maa bete ne baat nahin kii
 If mother and son are not talking with any fear then it is a matter of concern
 kairavaan patrika ke niranjan taakale ne jaj loya ke pita harikishan loya se november 2016 main mulaakaat kii thi
 Then he said that i am 85 years old, not afraid of death, but the girls and their children are worried about their lives
 express ne likhaa he ki harikishan loya, anuraadhaa biyani, sarita madhane kaa phone switch of, wo ghar par bhi nahin mili
 That is, those who talked to the caravan reporter could not contact the express reporters
 ghar par nahin mili
 Anuradha Biyani has given a video statement and is the only on record statement in this case
 kairavaan kii report bahan anuraadhaa biyani, sarita maanadhane or pita harikishan ke bayaan par aadhaarit he
 The Express has spoken to Srinivasa Loya, brother of Harikshan Loya, Justice Loya's uncle, who says his niece Anuradha has raised questions about the judge's death
 chachaa shrinivas loya ne enditivi se bhi baat karte hue kaha ki unhen yahi bataaya gaya tha ki postmortem ho chukaa he or shav ko baks main rakhkar nagpur se bheja ja chukaa he
 We were waiting for the dead body and when it arrived, there was no one else who was the ambulance driver
 yahi baat anuraadhaa biyani ne kahi he
 The name of the person who signed the body for autopsy after the post-mortem in the Caravan and Express reports
 prashanth rathi he
 Prashant Rathi has refused to talk on camera, he was tried by ndtv's Manas and Saurav Gupta
 prashanth rathi ne maanas se jo kaha or express se jo kaha usamen ek bahut bada antar he
 Prashant told ndtv's Manas that my uncle had reported the death of Judge Loya around six o'clock in the morning and that i immediately reached out to assist the family at the time of mourning
 dow prashanth rathi ne maanas se kaha ki ye ankal aurangabad main rahete hai or jaj loya ke kazin hai
 Rathi did not tell Manas that he had warts, used Uncle and cousin in English
 naam bhi nahin bataaya ki koun hai
 When we talk to the Rathi Express, it is clear that Moussa got a call and his name is Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia
 unka phone aata he ki unke kazin jaj loya meditrina aspataal main bhartee hai or mujhe loya kii madad ke liye kehete hai
 When i reach the hospital, the doctor says that he has died
 yah baat main apane ankal ko bataata hum
 Uncle asks me to take care of formalities
 ab aapane dekha ki prashanth rathi ek reporter se kehete hai ki ankal kaa phone aata he ki 6 baje loya kii maut ho gai he
 Loya tells a reporter that Loya is recruiting, help him
 aspataal jaakar pataa chalata he ki loya mar chuke hai
 Here is another question
 nagpur main doctor prashanth rathi hi akele sab manage kar rahe the to kya unase loya ke parivaar ke kisi kareebi ne baar-baar baat kii, jaanane ke liye ki kya ho rahaa he, shav kahaan le jayega
 Can Dr
 Rathi tell who was told by the family that the body will go to Gategaon, not Latur, to Mumbai
 dow prashanth rathi ne camere par baat karne se inkaar kar diya
 It is not clear how close Rathi's warts were to Jakotia judge Loya, was he talking to his father, was Anuradha talking to Biyani? Dr Prashant Rathi told Manas of NDTV that he had not seen the body of Judge Loya
 unhen ek chadar main lapeta gaya tha
 They just signed on
 kairavaan kii report main bahan anuraadhaa biyani nagpur main kisi rishtedaar kii baat karti hai magar naam nahin bataati hai
 There is no mention of Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia in their conversation, nor the name of Judge Loya's father
 prashanth rathi ne postmortem report main sin karte hue khud ko mritak kaa chachera bhai bataaya he
 From the father's side
 magar unke mausa jaj loya ko apana bhai bataate hai
 a wart's brother was like a wart
 to rathi ne khud ko loya kaa chachera bhai kaise bataa diya
 If i am right then Rathi Loya and Jakotia's nephew
 kya rukmesh pannalaal jakotia jaj loya kii patni, pita or bahan anuraadhaa ke sampark main the
 It is not clear from the report of the express that it was decided to send the dead body to Gategaon in place of Mumbai
 patni sharmila loya ko phone gaya tha to kya unhen pataa tha ki shav gaategaanv jayega, mumbai nahin aayega
 If his family lives around Latur, it may be a practical decision
 magar yahi nahin pataa chal rahaa he ki nagpur se gaategaanv le jane kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 This will be clear only when Sharmila Loya herself comes before the media and clarifies her position
 kairavaan ne yah to likhaa he ki maut kii soochna kaa phone patni ko bhi gaya, bahanon ko bhi or pita ko bhi
 Sister Anuradha says that there were some bards on the phone who call themselves judges, their call came
 bahan sarita bhi bataati hai ki barde naam ke jaj ne phone kiya tha
 The Indian Express report clears Barde's name
 ve jaj barde hai
 Judge Barde has been called a local judge in the report of the Express and his full name is Judge Vijay Kumar Barde
 express main he ki hoicourt ke nagpur bench ke dipti register rupesh rathi or barde justise loya ko dande aspataal lekar jate hai car main
 It is written in Caravan that two judges take Judge Loya in auto
 express main likhaa he ki do jaj car main jaj loya ko lekar jate hai
 Justice Sunil Shukre has said that Judge Barde was driving the car himself
 hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se justise gawai ne kaha ki ve us vakt nagpur main senior administrative justise the
 He also says from the Express that he, as a senior administrative judge, called him and then he reached Mediterina Hospital with his fellow judge Sunil Shukre
 apane dryver kaa bhi intazaar nahin kiya
 Both lived about a mile from Ravi Bhavan
 jaj ko lekar aspataal le jane main local jaj, dipti register, jaj kulkarani or jaj modak bhi the
 Justice Gavai has also told Sunil Singh that a total of five rooms were booked in Ravi Bhavan but at night all three preferred to stay in one room
 kyonki sabhi kii vaapasi kaa tikat ek hi saath kaa tha or agali subah mumbai lautnaa tha
 The two judges from Mumbai did not accompany the body because they were shocked by the death of the friend
 kairavaan main anuraadhaa biyani ne kaha he ki donon jaj dedh maheene tak parivaar se nahin mili
 Now you see that when Judge Loya's sisters questioned, Judge Sahiban was silent
 ab parivaar ke log chup hai to jaj sahiban apni baat rakh rahe hai
 The investigation has not been announced yet
 jaj loya ke bete ne tab ke chif justise ko patr likhaa tha ki mujhe dar he ki ye netaa mere parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 i do not have the strength to fight them
 hamaari zindagi khatare main he
 The son of a judge writes a letter to the Chief Justice
 maut ke 80 din baad
 This letter has been shown by Caravan magazine in its video
 is patr ke baad kya parivaar ko suraksha di gai, kyon nahin di gai? Manas of NDTV has stated in its report that there was no car designate for any judge in Ravi Bhavan
 yah baat ravi bhawan ke kuch staff ne maanas ko naam naa lene ke shart par bataai
 It should also be seen that the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly session was about to begin around the event
 kya us vakt ravi bhawan main koi ambulance thi
 All this investigation will reveal, not through media trials
 express main likhaa he ki jaj loya ne 4 baje seene main dard kii shikaayat kii lekin car se nikatom aspataal pahunchane main paune paanch baj jate hai
 What should take 45 minutes to cover the distance of three kilometers in the morning
 iskaa jawaab maaloom nahin he
 Now the question arises when Judge Loya got chest pain
 iske alag alag varjan hai
 In Caravan, Niranjan Takle has written that he had chest pain at 12:30
 anuraadhaa biyani ke anusaar donon jajon ne yah baat parivaar ko bataai thi
 According to Caravan, the post-mortem report said that there was pain at 4 o'clock and death at 6
15 o'clock
 indian express ko justise bhushan gawai ne bataaya ki jaj loya kii kareeb 4 baje tabiyat kharaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai from NDTV has said that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at 3:30 pm
 justise bhushan gawai ne hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se baat kii he
 In this context, Anuradha Biyani's statement becomes important that both the judges said that there was a chest problem at 12:30
 matlab justise modak or justise kulkarani ne
 But according to Justice Gavai, both went to the hospital in the morning with Judge Loya
 postmortem kii report kaa mahatv he magar aap jaanate hai ki is desh main postmortem kii report ke saath kya kya khilwaad ho jate hai
 This does not mean that this is what happened in this case, i am just referring for reference
 koun sahi bol rahaa he yah to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Do not doubt anyone unnecessarily
 sunil singh ne jab justise gawai se baat kii to ek or sawaal kaa jawaab mila
 According to him, only Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni went with Judge Loya
 gawai ke mutabik pehali baar ve shaadi main jaj loya se mili the
 According to him, the three people went out of the ceremony to eat Gokul Peth Paan
 teenon kaa matlab jaj loya, justise kulkarani or justise modak paan khaane gaye the
 Justice Gavai was called by the Deputy Registrar at six in the morning to inform Judge Loya's death, and then he went to the Meditrina Hospital where Justice Modak, Justice Kulakarni, Judge Barde and Deputy Registrar were present
 justise gawai isiu main gaye the or unke sharir par kahin koon ke nishaan nahin the
 Notice of death is everywhere at six o'clock
 jaj loya kii ek or bahan sarita ne kairavaan ke niranjan taakale se kaha he ki paanch baje jaj barde kaa phone aayaa tha ki brijagopal kii maut ho chuki he
 Whether a difference in time can be doubted, at least not in a media trial
 indian express kii report ke baad isiji kii chhapi hui tasviir ko lekar thodi sansani ho gai
 Brijgopal Lohia is written in the ECG report above and the date below is 30 November
 jabaki maut ek november ko hui he
 Does the ECG machine cause such a lapse
 aspataal ne is bare main kaha he ki 30 november kii jo taarikh dikh rahi he, wo takniki kharabi ho sakati he
 We re-calibrate our machine every three months so that such omissions do not happen, but sometimes such disturbances occur in between
 ham apane tathy par kaayam hai
 The ECG took place on December 1
 aspataal ne baad main express ko bataaya he jise express ne apni website par chapa he
 Whether there was a compliment on the report on that day, on 30 November, all this will be known only by investigation
 kuch logon ne isiji ko dekhakar kahana shuru kar diya ki isiji saamaanya he
 We spoke to two doctors but keep in mind a warning
 beemaari kaa pataa ek report se nahin chalata he, or ek report se bhi chalata he
 All these things should be under scrutiny, but now Caravan and Express have printed different versions, then we talked to two doctors
 anuraadhaa ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki dande haspital ke doctoron or karmchaariyon ne kya chikitsa kii gai iskaa koi vivaran dene se haspital ne inkaar kar diya, vahiin dande hospital ke nideshak pinaak dande ne express se baat kii he or byora diya
 You will see that most of the questions are being shared about the activities after death, there is similarity in many places, there is difference in many places
 koi bhi sawaal is baat ko thos rup se uthta nahin dikhaa ki kya jaj loya kii hatya kii gai hogi
 Many big judges were present during the post-mart
 iskaa vivaran kai tarah se sahi sabit hota he
 We had asked the question of whose decision the post-mart was, but you will get the answer to this question only through the process of law
 anuraadhaa biyani ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki doctor hone ke kaaran wo jaanati hai ki postmortem ke dauraan khun nahin nikalataa or biyani ne dobaaraa postmortem kii maang kii thi lekin vahaan ikatthe loya ke doston or sahakarmiyon ne unhen hatotsahit kiya ki yah kehete hue ki maamle ko or jatil banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Many officials say that blood does not come out at the time of postmart but our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar has given forensic expert Dr
 ke si sharma se baat kii
 He said the postmortem also happens without informing the family
 postmart hone ke baad kai baar kapadon main rakt lag jaataa he jiske kai kaaran hote hai
 The comments express or kairavaan main ek or kirdaar he
 Ishwar Bahati kairavaan main ise aresas kaa bataaya gaya he
 In the Express, these were Judge Loya's friends, Dr
 baheti kaa bhai bataaya gaya he or jaj loya ishwar baheti ke sampark main the
 But Baheti has not talked to Express and Caravan
 kam se kam unhen media se sampark karnaa chahie ki unke paas jaj loya kaa phone kaise aayaa, wo maut ke teen chaar dinon baad phone lekar kaise parivaar ke paas pahunch gaye, kya yah sahi he ki phone se data uda diya gaya tha, ek hi esemes bachaa tha
 Supreme Court lawyer Sudeep Srivastava has raised some questions
 bahut tarah ke sawaal hai jo ek duusare se takaraa rahe hai
 Whether the family members have said it will be proved by investigation, or it will be unilaterally dismissed from here or there through the statement
 mobile tower se pataa chal saktaa he ki koun jaj kahaan tak gaye the, koun kisase baat kar rahaa tha, loya ne kise phone kiya, patni ko kis number se phone gaya
 But all this can be revealed only by investigation when the facts and witnesses will be produced
 express ne likhaa he ki harikishan loya, anuraadhaa biyani, sarita madhane kaa phone switch of, wo ghar par bhi nahin mili
 That is, those who talked to the caravan reporter could not contact the express reporters
 ghar par nahin mili
 Anuradha Biyani has given a video statement and is the only on record statement in this case
 kairavaan kii report bahan anuraadhaa biyani, sarita maanadhane or pita harikishan ke bayaan par aadhaarit he

 If i am right then Rathi Loya and Jakotia's nephew
 kya rukmesh pannalaal jakotia jaj loya kii patni, pita or bahan anuraadhaa ke sampark main the
 It is not clear from the report of the express that it was decided to send the dead body to Gategaon in place of Mumbai

 The son of a judge writes a letter to the Chief Justice
 maut ke 80 din baad
 This letter has been shown by Caravan magazine in its video
 is patr ke baad kya parivaar ko suraksha di gai, kyon nahin di gai? Manas of NDTV has stated in its report that there was no car designate for any judge in Ravi Bhavan
 yah baat ravi bhawan ke kuch staff ne maanas ko naam naa lene ke shart par bataai
 It should also be seen that the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly session was about to begin around the event
 kya us vakt ravi bhawan main koi ambulance thi
 All this investigation will reveal, not through media trials
 express main likhaa he ki jaj loya ne 4 baje seene main dard kii shikaayat kii lekin car se nikatom aspataal pahunchane main paune paanch baj jate hai
 What should take 45 minutes to cover the distance of three kilometers in the morning
 iskaa jawaab maaloom nahin he
 Now the question arises when Judge Loya got chest pain
 iske alag alag varjan hai
 In Caravan, Niranjan Takle has written that he had chest pain at 12:30
 anuraadhaa biyani ke anusaar donon jajon ne yah baat parivaar ko bataai thi
 According to Caravan, the post-mortem report said that there was pain at 4 o'clock and death at 6
15 o'clock
 indian express ko justise bhushan gawai ne bataaya ki jaj loya kii kareeb 4 baje tabiyat kharaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai from NDTV has said that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at 3:30 pm
 justise bhushan gawai ne hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se baat kii he
 In this context, Anuradha Biyani's statement becomes important that both the judges said that there was a chest problem at 12:30
 matlab justise modak or justise kulkarani ne
 But according to Justice Gavai, both went to the hospital in the morning with Judge Loya
 postmortem kii report kaa mahatv he magar aap jaanate hai ki is desh main postmortem kii report ke saath kya kya khilwaad ho jate hai
 This does not mean that this is what happened in this case, i am just referring for reference
 koun sahi bol rahaa he yah to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Do not doubt anyone unnecessarily
 sunil singh ne jab justise gawai se baat kii to ek or sawaal kaa jawaab mila
 According to him, only Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni went with Judge Loya
 gawai ke mutabik pehali baar ve shaadi main jaj loya se mili the
 According to him, the three people went out of the ceremony to eat Gokul Peth Paan
 teenon kaa matlab jaj loya, justise kulkarani or justise modak paan khaane gaye the
 Justice Gavai was called by the Deputy Registrar at six in the morning to inform Judge Loya's death, and then he went to the Meditrina Hospital where Justice Modak, Justice Kulakarni, Judge Barde and Deputy Registrar were present
 justise gawai isiu main gaye the or unke sharir par kahin koon ke nishaan nahin the
 Notice of death is everywhere at six o'clock
 jaj loya kii ek or bahan sarita ne kairavaan ke niranjan taakale se kaha he ki paanch baje jaj barde kaa phone aayaa tha ki brijagopal kii maut ho chuki he
 Whether a difference in time can be doubted, at least not in a media trial
 indian express kii report ke baad isiji kii chhapi hui tasviir ko lekar thodi sansani ho gai
 Brijgopal Lohia is written in the ECG report above and the date below is 30 November
 jabaki maut ek november ko hui he
 Does the ECG machine cause such a lapse
 aspataal ne is bare main kaha he ki 30 november kii jo taarikh dikh rahi he, wo takniki kharabi ho sakati he
 We re-calibrate our machine every three months so that such omissions do not happen, but sometimes such disturbances occur in between
 ham apane tathy par kaayam hai
 The ECG took place on December 1
 aspataal ne baad main express ko bataaya he jise express ne apni website par chapa he
 Whether there was a compliment on the report on that day, on 30 November, all this will be known only by investigation
 kuch logon ne isiji ko dekhakar kahana shuru kar diya ki isiji saamaanya he
 We spoke to two doctors but keep in mind a warning
 beemaari kaa pataa ek report se nahin chalata he, or ek report se bhi chalata he
 All these things should be under scrutiny, but now Caravan and Express have printed different versions, then we talked to two doctors
 anuraadhaa ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki dande haspital ke doctoron or karmchaariyon ne kya chikitsa kii gai iskaa koi vivaran dene se haspital ne inkaar kar diya, vahiin dande hospital ke nideshak pinaak dande ne express se baat kii he or byora diya
 You will see that most of the questions are being shared about the activities after death, there is similarity in many places, there is difference in many places
 koi bhi sawaal is baat ko thos rup se uthta nahin dikhaa ki kya jaj loya kii hatya kii gai hogi
 Many big judges were present during the post-mart
 iskaa vivaran kai tarah se sahi sabit hota he
 We had asked the question of whose decision the post-mart was, but you will get the answer to this question only through the process of law
 anuraadhaa biyani ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki doctor hone ke kaaran wo jaanati hai ki postmortem ke dauraan khun nahin nikalataa or biyani ne dobaaraa postmortem kii maang kii thi lekin vahaan ikatthe loya ke doston or sahakarmiyon ne unhen hatotsahit kiya ki yah kehete hue ki maamle ko or jatil banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Many officials say that blood does not come out at the time of postmart but our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar has given forensic expert Dr
 ke si sharma se baat kii
 He said the postmortem also happens without informing the family
 postmart hone ke baad kai baar kapadon main rakt lag jaataa he jiske kai kaaran hote hai
 The comments express or kairavaan main ek or kirdaar he
 Ishwar Bahati kairavaan main ise aresas kaa bataaya gaya he
 In the Express, these were Judge Loya's friends, Dr
 baheti kaa bhai bataaya gaya he or jaj loya ishwar baheti ke sampark main the
 But Baheti has not talked to Express and Caravan
 kam se kam unhen media se sampark karnaa chahie ki unke paas jaj loya kaa phone kaise aayaa, wo maut ke teen chaar dinon baad phone lekar kaise parivaar ke paas pahunch gaye, kya yah sahi he ki phone se data uda diya gaya tha, ek hi esemes bachaa tha
 Supreme Court lawyer Sudeep Srivastava has raised some questions
 bahut tarah ke sawaal hai jo ek duusare se takaraa rahe hai
 Whether the family members have said it will be proved by investigation, or it will be unilaterally dismissed from here or there through the statement
 mobile tower se pataa chal saktaa he ki koun jaj kahaan tak gaye the, koun kisase baat kar rahaa tha, loya ne kise phone kiya, patni ko kis number se phone gaya
 But all this can be revealed only by investigation when the facts and witnesses will be produced
 kairavaan kii report bahan anuraadhaa biyani, sarita maanadhane or pita harikishan ke bayaan par aadhaarit he
 The Express has spoken to Srinivasa Loya, brother of Harikshan Loya, Justice Loya's uncle, who says his niece Anuradha has raised questions about the judge's death
 chachaa shrinivas loya ne enditivi se bhi baat karte hue kaha ki unhen yahi bataaya gaya tha ki postmortem ho chukaa he or shav ko baks main rakhkar nagpur se bheja ja chukaa he
 We were waiting for the dead body and when it arrived, there was no one else who was the ambulance driver
 yahi baat anuraadhaa biyani ne kahi he
 The name of the person who signed the body for autopsy after the post-mortem in the Caravan and Express reports
 prashanth rathi he
 Prashant Rathi has refused to talk on camera, he was tried by ndtv's Manas and Saurav Gupta
 prashanth rathi ne maanas se jo kaha or express se jo kaha usamen ek bahut bada antar he
 Prashant told ndtv's Manas that my uncle had reported the death of Judge Loya around six o'clock in the morning and that i immediately reached out to assist the family at the time of mourning
 dow prashanth rathi ne maanas se kaha ki ye ankal aurangabad main rahete hai or jaj loya ke kazin hai
 Rathi did not tell Manas that he had warts, used Uncle and cousin in English
 naam bhi nahin bataaya ki koun hai
 When we talk to the Rathi Express, it is clear that Moussa got a call and his name is Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia
 unka phone aata he ki unke kazin jaj loya meditrina aspataal main bhartee hai or mujhe loya kii madad ke liye kehete hai
 When i reach the hospital, the doctor says that he has died
 yah baat main apane ankal ko bataata hum
 Uncle asks me to take care of formalities
 ab aapane dekha ki prashanth rathi ek reporter se kehete hai ki ankal kaa phone aata he ki 6 baje loya kii maut ho gai he
 Loya tells a reporter that Loya is recruiting, help him
 aspataal jaakar pataa chalata he ki loya mar chuke hai
 Here is another question
 nagpur main doctor prashanth rathi hi akele sab manage kar rahe the to kya unase loya ke parivaar ke kisi kareebi ne baar-baar baat kii, jaanane ke liye ki kya ho rahaa he, shav kahaan le jayega
 Can Dr
 Rathi tell who was told by the family that the body will go to Gategaon, not Latur, to Mumbai
 dow prashanth rathi ne camere par baat karne se inkaar kar diya
 It is not clear how close Rathi's warts were to Jakotia judge Loya, was he talking to his father, was Anuradha talking to Biyani? Dr Prashant Rathi told Manas of NDTV that he had not seen the body of Judge Loya
 unhen ek chadar main lapeta gaya tha
 They just signed on
 kairavaan kii report main bahan anuraadhaa biyani nagpur main kisi rishtedaar kii baat karti hai magar naam nahin bataati hai
 There is no mention of Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia in their conversation, nor the name of Judge Loya's father
 prashanth rathi ne postmortem report main sin karte hue khud ko mritak kaa chachera bhai bataaya he
 From the father's side
 magar unke mausa jaj loya ko apana bhai bataate hai
 a wart's brother was like a wart
 to rathi ne khud ko loya kaa chachera bhai kaise bataa diya
 If i am right then Rathi Loya and Jakotia's nephew
 kya rukmesh pannalaal jakotia jaj loya kii patni, pita or bahan anuraadhaa ke sampark main the
 It is not clear from the report of the express that it was decided to send the dead body to Gategaon in place of Mumbai
 patni sharmila loya ko phone gaya tha to kya unhen pataa tha ki shav gaategaanv jayega, mumbai nahin aayega
 If his family lives around Latur, it may be a practical decision
 magar yahi nahin pataa chal rahaa he ki nagpur se gaategaanv le jane kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 This will be clear only when Sharmila Loya herself comes before the media and clarifies her position
 kairavaan ne yah to likhaa he ki maut kii soochna kaa phone patni ko bhi gaya, bahanon ko bhi or pita ko bhi
 Sister Anuradha says that there were some bards on the phone who call themselves judges, their call came
 bahan sarita bhi bataati hai ki barde naam ke jaj ne phone kiya tha
 The Indian Express report clears Barde's name
 ve jaj barde hai
 Judge Barde has been called a local judge in the report of the Express and his full name is Judge Vijay Kumar Barde
 express main he ki hoicourt ke nagpur bench ke dipti register rupesh rathi or barde justise loya ko dande aspataal lekar jate hai car main
 It is written in Caravan that two judges take Judge Loya in auto
 express main likhaa he ki do jaj car main jaj loya ko lekar jate hai
 Justice Sunil Shukre has said that Judge Barde was driving the car himself
 hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se justise gawai ne kaha ki ve us vakt nagpur main senior administrative justise the
 He also says from the Express that he, as a senior administrative judge, called him and then he reached Mediterina Hospital with his fellow judge Sunil Shukre
 apane dryver kaa bhi intazaar nahin kiya
 Both lived about a mile from Ravi Bhavan
 jaj ko lekar aspataal le jane main local jaj, dipti register, jaj kulkarani or jaj modak bhi the
 Justice Gavai has also told Sunil Singh that a total of five rooms were booked in Ravi Bhavan but at night all three preferred to stay in one room
 kyonki sabhi kii vaapasi kaa tikat ek hi saath kaa tha or agali subah mumbai lautnaa tha
 The two judges from Mumbai did not accompany the body because they were shocked by the death of the friend
 kairavaan main anuraadhaa biyani ne kaha he ki donon jaj dedh maheene tak parivaar se nahin mili
 Now you see that when Judge Loya's sisters questioned, Judge Sahiban was silent
 ab parivaar ke log chup hai to jaj sahiban apni baat rakh rahe hai
 The investigation has not been announced yet
 jaj loya ke bete ne tab ke chif justise ko patr likhaa tha ki mujhe dar he ki ye netaa mere parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 i do not have the strength to fight them
 hamaari zindagi khatare main he

 But all this can be revealed only by investigation when the facts and witnesses will be produced
 prashanth ne enditivi ke maanas se kaha ki mere ankal ne subah chah baje ke kareeb jaj loya kii maut kii soochna di or main shok ke samay main parivaar kii sahaayta ke liye turant pahunchaa
 Dr
 Prashant Rathi told Manas that he lives in Uncle Aurangabad and is the cousin of Judge Loya
 rathi ne maanas ko rishta nahin bataaya ki mausa hai, angrezi kaa ankal or kazin istamaal kiya
 The name was not even told who it was
 yahi rathi express se baat karte hai to saaf-saaf kehete hai ki mausa kaa phone aayaa or unka naam rukmesh pannalaal jakotia he
 He gets a call that his cousin Judge Loya is admitted to the Meditrina Hospital and asks me to help Loya
 jab main aspataal pahunchataa hum to doctor bataate hai ki unki maut ho chuki he
 i tell this to my uncle
 ankal mujhe aupchaariktaaon kaa dhyaan rakhane ke liye kehete hai
 Now you see that Prashant Rathi tells a reporter that Uncle's phone call that Loya has died at 6 o'clock
 ek reporter se kehete hai ki loya bhartee hai, unki madad karen
 Going to the hospital, he learns that Loya is dead
 yahaan ek or sawaal he
 In Nagpur, Dr
 Prashant Rathi was the only one managing all, so did someone close to Loya's family repeatedly talk to him, to know what is going on, where the body will be taken
 kya doctor rathi bataa sakate hai ki unase parivaar ke kisne kaha ki shav mumbai nahin, latur se sata gaategaanv jayega
 Dr
 Prashant Rathi refused to speak on camera
 yah saaf nahin he ki rathi ke mausa jakotia jaj loya ke kitne kareebi the, kya ve pita se baat kar rahe the, kya anuraadhaa biyani se baat kar rahe the? dow prashanth rathi ne enditivi ke maanas ko bataaya ki unhone jaj loya ke shav ko nahin dekha tha
 They were wrapped in a sheet
 bas unhone sin kar diya
 In Caravan's report, sister Anuradha Biyani talks about a relative in Nagpur but does not mention the name
 unki baatcheet main rukmesh pannalaal jakotia kaa koi zikr nahin he, na hi jaj loya ke pita ne naam liya he
 Prashant Rathi, signing the post-mortem report, described himself as the cousin of the deceased
 pita ke said se
 But his warts call Judge Loya his brother
 mausa kaa bhai to mausa ke baraabar hua
 So how did Rathi tell herself Loya's cousin
 agar main sahi hum to rathi loya or jakotia ke bhatija lagenge
 Was Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia in touch with Judge Loya's wife, father and sister Anuradha
 express kii report se saaf nahin hota he ki shav mumbai kii jagah latur ke gaategaanv bhejne kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 If wife Sharmila Loya got a call, did she know that the body would go to Gategaon, not to Mumbai
 unka parivaar latur ke aas-paas rahata he to ho saktaa he ki yah vyaavhaarik faisla ho
 But it is not known whose decision it was to move from Nagpur to Gategaon
 yah tabhi saaf hoga jab sharmila loya khud media ke saamne aakar apni sthiti saaf karengi
 Caravan has written that the call for the information of the death went to the wife as well as to the sisters and also to the father
 bahan anuraadhaa ye bataati hai ki phone par koi barde the jo apane ko jaj bataate hai, unka phone aayaa tha
 Sister Sarita also tells that a judge named Barde called
 indian express kii report main barde kaa naam saaf ho jaataa he
 He is Judge Barde
 jaj barde ko express kii report main local jaj kaha gaya he or inkaa puraa naam he jaj vijay kumaar barde
 It is in the express that Rupesh Rathi, Deputy Registrar of Nagpur Bench of High Court and Barde Justice Loya take him to Dande Hospital in a car
 kairavaan main likhaa he ki do jaj aato main jaj loya ko lekar jate hai
 It is written in the express that two judges take Judge Loya in the car
 justise sunil shukre ne kaha he ki jaj barde car khud chalaa rahe the
 Justice Gavai told our colleague Sunil Singh that he was the Senior Administrative Justice in Nagpur at that time
 express se bhi vahi kehete hai ki varisht prashaskeey jaj hone ke naate unhen hi phone kiya or tab ve apane saathi jaj sunil shukre ko lekar meditirina aspatal pahunche
 Did not even wait for my driver
 donon ravi bhawan se ek mile kii duuri par rahete the
 Local judges, deputy registrars, judge Kulkarni and Judge Modak were also there to take the judge to the hospital
 justise gawai ne sunil singh ko yah bhi bataaya he ki ravi bhawan main kul paanch kamare book the magar raat main teenon ne ek hi kamare main rahanaa pansad kiya
 Because everyone's return ticket was the same and was to return to Mumbai the next morning
 mumbai se gaye donon jaj shav ke saath isliye nahin gaye kyonki ve dost kii maut ke sadame main the
 In Caravan, Anuradha Biyani has said that the two judges did not meet the family for a month and a half
 ab aap dekh rahe hai ki jab jaj loya kii bahanon ne sawaal kiya to jaj sahiban chup the
 Now the family members are silent, then Judge Sahiban is speaking
 jaanch kaa elaan abhi tak nahin hua he
 Judge Loya's son wrote a letter to the then Chief Justice saying that i am afraid that these leaders may harm any member of my family
 mere paas inase ladane kii takat nahin he
 Our life is in danger ek jaj kaa betaa chif justise ko patr likhata he
 80 days after death
 yah patr kairavaan patrika ne apane video main dikhaaya he
 After this letter, was the family given protection, why not? enditivi ke maanas ne apni report main kaha he ki ravi bhawan main kisi bhi jaj ke liye koi car desiganet nahin thi
 Some staff members of Ravi Bhavan told Manas on condition of anonymity
 yah bhi dekha janaa chahie ki ghatana ke aasapaas maharashtra vidhansabha kaa satr shuru hone vaala tha
 Was there any ambulance in Ravi Bhavan at that time
 yah sab jaanch se pataa chalegaa, media trial se nahin
 It is written in the express that Judge Loya complained of chest pain at 4 o'clock but it is a quarter past five to reach the nearest hospital by car
 subah ke vakt teen kilometre kaa faasla tay karne main kya 45 minute laganaa chahie
 The answer is not known
 ab sawaal uthta he ki jaj loya ko seene main kab dard hua
 It has different versions
 kairavaan main niranjan taakale ne likhaa he ki saadhe baarah baje seene main dard hua
 According to Anuradha Biyani, both the judges had told this to the family
 kairavaan ke anusaar postmortem report main kaha gaya he ki 4 baje dard hua or sava 6 baje maut hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai told the Indian Express that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at around 4 am
 enditivi se justise bhushan gawai ne kaha he ki saadhe teen baje jaj loya kii tabiyat karaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai has spoken to our colleague Sunil Singh
 is sandarbh main anuraadhaa biyani kaa bayaan mahatvapurn ho jaataa he ki donon jajon ne bataaya ki saadhe baarah baje seene main takalif hui
 Meaning Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni
 magar justise gawai ke anusaar to donon subah ke vakt jaj loya ko lekar aspataal gaye the
 The report of the post-mortem is important but you know what messes with the post-mortem report in this country
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki is cese main yahi hua he, main bas sandarbh ke liye bataa rahaa hum
 Who is saying the right thing will be known only through investigation
 aap bhi kisi par bevajaah shaq na karen
 Another question was answered when Sunil Singh spoke to Justice Gavai
 unke anusaar justise modak or justise kulkarani hi jaj loya ke saath gaye the
 According to Gawai, he met Judge Loya for the first time in marriage
 unke mutabik samaaroh se nikalakar teenon log gokul peth paan khaane gaye the
 The trio meant Judge Loya, Justice Kulakarni and Justice Modak went to eat paan
 justise gawai ko subah chah baje dipti register ne phone kar jaj loya ke maut kii soochna di, or tab ve meditrina aspataal gaye jahaan par justise modak, justise kulkarani, jaj barde or dipti register maujuud the
 Justice Gavai went to the ICU and there were no blood stains on his body
 maut kii soochna har jagah chah baje hai
 Sarita, another sister of Judge Loya, has told Niranjan Takle of Caravan that at five o'clock Judge Barde got a call that Brijgopal had died
 kya samay main antar ko lekar shaq kiya ja saktaa he, kam se kam media trial main nahin hona chahie
 After the report of Indian Express, there was some sensation about the printed picture of ECG
 isiji kii report main upar brijagopal lohia likhaa he or neeche kii taarikh 30 november he
 While the death occurred on November 1
 kya isiji mashin se aisi chook ho jaati he
 The hospital has said about this that the date of November 30 is visible, it may be technical fault
 ham har teen maheene par apni mashin ko ri-calibratt karte hai taaki aisi chook na ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi bich-bich main aisi gadabadi ho jaati he
 We stand by our facts
 isiji disambar ek taarikh ko hui thi
 The hospital later revealed the express, which the Express has published on its website
 kya us rose or bhi report par 30 november kii tarif chhapi thi, ye sab to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Some people started looking at ECG and started saying that ECG is normal
 hamane do doctoron se baat kii lekin ek chetavanee dhyaan main rakhiegaa
 The disease is not detected by a report, and also by a report
 yah sari baaten jaanch ke daayre main honi chahie magar ab kairavaan or express ne alag-alag varjan chaape hai to hamane do doctoron se baat kar lee
 Anuradha has told Caravan that the hospital and doctors at Dande Hospital refused to give any details of what was done, while Pinak Dande, director of Dande Hospital, spoke to the Express and gave details
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar sawaal maut ke baad kii gatividhiyon ko lekar jo soochnaaon kaa aadan pradaan ho rahaa he, usamen kai jagah samanta he, kai jagah antar he
 No question arises concretely as to whether Judge Loya would have been murdered
 postmart ke vakt kai bade jaj maujuud the
 Its description proves to be true in many ways
 hamane yah sawaal kiya tha ki postmart kaa faisla kiskaa tha, lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab aapako kanoon kii prakriya se hi milegaa
 Anuradha Biyani has told Caravan that as a doctor she knows that blood does not come out during the post-mortem and Biyani again demanded a post-mortem but Loya's friends and colleagues gathered there discouraged her saying that the case No need to further complicate
 kai adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki postmart ke samay khun nahin nikalataa lekin hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger ne forensik export dow
 Talked to KC Sharma
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ko suchit kiye bina bhi postmortem ho jaataa he
 After the post-mortem, there are many reasons why blood gets put into clothes due to many reasons
 tippaniyan Express and Caravan have another character
 ishwar baheti
 In the caravan it is described as RSS
 express main inhen jaj loya ke mitra dow
 Baheti's brother is said to be and Judge Loya was in contact with Ishwar Baheti
 magar baheti ne express or kairavaan se baat nahin kii he
 At least they should contact the media about how they got Judge Loya's phone, how he reached the family with the phone three to four days after his death, is it true that the data was blown out of the phone, the same SMS was saved
 supreme court ke vakil sudeep shrivastav ne kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 There are a wide variety of questions that clash with each other
 parivaar ke sadasyon ne jo kaha he kya use jaanch se sabit kiya jayega, yaa phir ekatarfa idhar se yaa udhar se bayaan ke zarie khaarij kar diya jayega
 From the mobile tower, we can know who the judge went to, who he was talking to, whom Loya called, who called the wife from
 magar ye sab to jaanch se hi saamne aa sakegaa jab tathy or gavaahon kii peshi hogi
 When we talk to the Rathi Express, it is clear that Moussa got a call and his name is Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia
 unka phone aata he ki unke kazin jaj loya meditrina aspataal main bhartee hai or mujhe loya kii madad ke liye kehete hai
 When i reach the hospital, the doctor says that he has died
 yah baat main apane ankal ko bataata hum
 Uncle asks me to take care of formalities
 ab aapane dekha ki prashanth rathi ek reporter se kehete hai ki ankal kaa phone aata he ki 6 baje loya kii maut ho gai he
 Loya tells a reporter that Loya is recruiting, help him
 aspataal jaakar pataa chalata he ki loya mar chuke hai
 Here is another question
 nagpur main doctor prashanth rathi hi akele sab manage kar rahe the to kya unase loya ke parivaar ke kisi kareebi ne baar-baar baat kii, jaanane ke liye ki kya ho rahaa he, shav kahaan le jayega
 Can Dr
 Rathi tell who was told by the family that the body will go to Gategaon, not Latur, to Mumbai
 dow prashanth rathi ne camere par baat karne se inkaar kar diya
 It is not clear how close Rathi's warts were to Jakotia judge Loya, was he talking to his father, was Anuradha talking to Biyani? Dr Prashant Rathi told Manas of NDTV that he had not seen the body of Judge Loya
 unhen ek chadar main lapeta gaya tha
 They just signed on

 There is no mention of Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia in their conversation, nor the name of Judge Loya's father
 prashanth rathi ne postmortem report main sin karte hue khud ko mritak kaa chachera bhai bataaya he
 From the father's side
 magar unke mausa jaj loya ko apana bhai bataate hai
 a wart's brother was like a wart
 to rathi ne khud ko loya kaa chachera bhai kaise bataa diya
 If i am right then Rathi Loya and Jakotia's nephew
 kya rukmesh pannalaal jakotia jaj loya kii patni, pita or bahan anuraadhaa ke sampark main the
 It is not clear from the report of the express that it was decided to send the dead body to Gategaon in place of Mumbai
 patni sharmila loya ko phone gaya tha to kya unhen pataa tha ki shav gaategaanv jayega, mumbai nahin aayega
 If his family lives around Latur, it may be a practical decision
 magar yahi nahin pataa chal rahaa he ki nagpur se gaategaanv le jane kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 This will be clear only when Sharmila Loya herself comes before the media and clarifies her position
 kairavaan ne yah to likhaa he ki maut kii soochna kaa phone patni ko bhi gaya, bahanon ko bhi or pita ko bhi
 Sister Anuradha says that there were some bards on the phone who call themselves judges, their call came
 bahan sarita bhi bataati hai ki barde naam ke jaj ne phone kiya tha
 The Indian Express report clears Barde's name
 ve jaj barde hai
 Judge Barde has been called a local judge in the report of the Express and his full name is Judge Vijay Kumar Barde
 express main he ki hoicourt ke nagpur bench ke dipti register rupesh rathi or barde justise loya ko dande aspataal lekar jate hai car main
 It is written in Caravan that two judges take Judge Loya in auto
 express main likhaa he ki do jaj car main jaj loya ko lekar jate hai
 Justice Sunil Shukre has said that Judge Barde was driving the car himself
 hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se justise gawai ne kaha ki ve us vakt nagpur main senior administrative justise the
 He also says from the Express that he, as a senior administrative judge, called him and then he reached Mediterina Hospital with his fellow judge Sunil Shukre
 apane dryver kaa bhi intazaar nahin kiya
 Both lived about a mile from Ravi Bhavan
 jaj ko lekar aspataal le jane main local jaj, dipti register, jaj kulkarani or jaj modak bhi the
 Justice Gavai has also told Sunil Singh that a total of five rooms were booked in Ravi Bhavan but at night all three preferred to stay in one room
 kyonki sabhi kii vaapasi kaa tikat ek hi saath kaa tha or agali subah mumbai lautnaa tha
 The two judges from Mumbai did not accompany the body because they were shocked by the death of the friend
 kairavaan main anuraadhaa biyani ne kaha he ki donon jaj dedh maheene tak parivaar se nahin mili
 Now you see that when Judge Loya's sisters questioned, Judge Sahiban was silent
 ab parivaar ke log chup hai to jaj sahiban apni baat rakh rahe hai
 The investigation has not been announced yet
 jaj loya ke bete ne tab ke chif justise ko patr likhaa tha ki mujhe dar he ki ye netaa mere parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai

 Now the question arises when Judge Loya got chest pain
 iske alag alag varjan hai
 In Caravan, Niranjan Takle has written that he had chest pain at 12:30
 anuraadhaa biyani ke anusaar donon jajon ne yah baat parivaar ko bataai thi
 According to Caravan, the post-mortem report said that there was pain at 4 o'clock and death at 6
15 o'clock
 indian express ko justise bhushan gawai ne bataaya ki jaj loya kii kareeb 4 baje tabiyat kharaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai from NDTV has said that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at 3:30 pm
 justise bhushan gawai ne hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se baat kii he
 In this context, Anuradha Biyani's statement becomes important that both the judges said that there was a chest problem at 12:30
 matlab justise modak or justise kulkarani ne
 But according to Justice Gavai, both went to the hospital in the morning with Judge Loya
 postmortem kii report kaa mahatv he magar aap jaanate hai ki is desh main postmortem kii report ke saath kya kya khilwaad ho jate hai
 This does not mean that this is what happened in this case, i am just referring for reference

 According to him, only Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni went with Judge Loya

 According to him, the three people went out of the ceremony to eat Gokul Peth Paan

 Justice Gavai was called by the Deputy Registrar at six in the morning to inform Judge Loya's death, and then he went to the Meditrina Hospital where Justice Modak, Justice Kulakarni, Judge Barde and Deputy Registrar were present
 justise gawai isiu main gaye the or unke sharir par kahin koon ke nishaan nahin the
 Notice of death is everywhere at six o'clock
 jaj loya kii ek or bahan sarita ne kairavaan ke niranjan taakale se kaha he ki paanch baje jaj barde kaa phone aayaa tha ki brijagopal kii maut ho chuki he
 Whether a difference in time can be doubted, at least not in a media trial
 indian express kii report ke baad isiji kii chhapi hui tasviir ko lekar thodi sansani ho gai
 Brijgopal Lohia is written in the ECG report above and the date below is 30 November
 jabaki maut ek november ko hui he
 Does the ECG machine cause such a lapse
 aspataal ne is bare main kaha he ki 30 november kii jo taarikh dikh rahi he, wo takniki kharabi ho sakati he
 We re-calibrate our machine every three months so that such omissions do not happen, but sometimes such disturbances occur in between
 ham apane tathy par kaayam hai
 The ECG took place on December 1
 aspataal ne baad main express ko bataaya he jise express ne apni website par chapa he
 Whether there was a compliment on the report on that day, on 30 November, all this will be known only by investigation
 kuch logon ne isiji ko dekhakar kahana shuru kar diya ki isiji saamaanya he
 We spoke to two doctors but keep in mind a warning
 beemaari kaa pataa ek report se nahin chalata he, or ek report se bhi chalata he
 All these things should be under scrutiny, but now Caravan and Express have printed different versions, then we talked to two doctors

 You will see that most of the questions are being shared about the activities after death, there is similarity in many places, there is difference in many places
 koi bhi sawaal is baat ko thos rup se uthta nahin dikhaa ki kya jaj loya kii hatya kii gai hogi

 indian express ko justise bhushan gawai ne bataaya ki jaj loya kii kareeb 4 baje tabiyat kharaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai from NDTV has said that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at 3:30 pm
 justise bhushan gawai ne hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se baat kii he
 In this context, Anuradha Biyani's statement becomes important that both the judges said that there was a chest problem at 12:30
 matlab justise modak or justise kulkarani ne
 But according to Justice Gavai, both went to the hospital in the morning with Judge Loya
 postmortem kii report kaa mahatv he magar aap jaanate hai ki is desh main postmortem kii report ke saath kya kya khilwaad ho jate hai
 This does not mean that this is what happened in this case, i am just referring for reference
 koun sahi bol rahaa he yah to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Do not doubt anyone unnecessarily
 sunil singh ne jab justise gawai se baat kii to ek or sawaal kaa jawaab mila
 According to him, only Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni went with Judge Loya
 gawai ke mutabik pehali baar ve shaadi main jaj loya se mili the
 According to him, the three people went out of the ceremony to eat Gokul Peth Paan
 teenon kaa matlab jaj loya, justise kulkarani or justise modak paan khaane gaye the
 Justice Gavai was called by the Deputy Registrar at six in the morning to inform Judge Loya's death, and then he went to the Meditrina Hospital where Justice Modak, Justice Kulakarni, Judge Barde and Deputy Registrar were present
 justise gawai isiu main gaye the or unke sharir par kahin koon ke nishaan nahin the
 Notice of death is everywhere at six o'clock
 jaj loya kii ek or bahan sarita ne kairavaan ke niranjan taakale se kaha he ki paanch baje jaj barde kaa phone aayaa tha ki brijagopal kii maut ho chuki he
 Whether a difference in time can be doubted, at least not in a media trial
 indian express kii report ke baad isiji kii chhapi hui tasviir ko lekar thodi sansani ho gai
 Brijgopal Lohia is written in the ECG report above and the date below is 30 November
 jabaki maut ek november ko hui he
 Does the ECG machine cause such a lapse
 aspataal ne is bare main kaha he ki 30 november kii jo taarikh dikh rahi he, wo takniki kharabi ho sakati he
 We re-calibrate our machine every three months so that such omissions do not happen, but sometimes such disturbances occur in between
 ham apane tathy par kaayam hai
 The ECG took place on December 1
 aspataal ne baad main express ko bataaya he jise express ne apni website par chapa he
 Whether there was a compliment on the report on that day, on 30 November, all this will be known only by investigation
 kuch logon ne isiji ko dekhakar kahana shuru kar diya ki isiji saamaanya he
 We spoke to two doctors but keep in mind a warning
 beemaari kaa pataa ek report se nahin chalata he, or ek report se bhi chalata he
 All these things should be under scrutiny, but now Caravan and Express have printed different versions, then we talked to two doctors
 anuraadhaa ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki dande haspital ke doctoron or karmchaariyon ne kya chikitsa kii gai iskaa koi vivaran dene se haspital ne inkaar kar diya, vahiin dande hospital ke nideshak pinaak dande ne express se baat kii he or byora diya
 You will see that most of the questions are being shared about the activities after death, there is similarity in many places, there is difference in many places
 koi bhi sawaal is baat ko thos rup se uthta nahin dikhaa ki kya jaj loya kii hatya kii gai hogi
 Many big judges were present during the post-mart
 iskaa vivaran kai tarah se sahi sabit hota he
 We had asked the question of whose decision the post-mart was, but you will get the answer to this question only through the process of law
 anuraadhaa biyani ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki doctor hone ke kaaran wo jaanati hai ki postmortem ke dauraan khun nahin nikalataa or biyani ne dobaaraa postmortem kii maang kii thi lekin vahaan ikatthe loya ke doston or sahakarmiyon ne unhen hatotsahit kiya ki yah kehete hue ki maamle ko or jatil banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Many officials say that blood does not come out at the time of postmart but our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar has given forensic expert Dr
 ke si sharma se baat kii
 He said the postmortem also happens without informing the family
 postmart hone ke baad kai baar kapadon main rakt lag jaataa he jiske kai kaaran hote hai
 The comments express or kairavaan main ek or kirdaar he
 Ishwar Bahati kairavaan main ise aresas kaa bataaya gaya he
 In the Express, these were Judge Loya's friends, Dr
 baheti kaa bhai bataaya gaya he or jaj loya ishwar baheti ke sampark main the
 But Baheti has not talked to Express and Caravan
 kam se kam unhen media se sampark karnaa chahie ki unke paas jaj loya kaa phone kaise aayaa, wo maut ke teen chaar dinon baad phone lekar kaise parivaar ke paas pahunch gaye, kya yah sahi he ki phone se data uda diya gaya tha, ek hi esemes bachaa tha
 Supreme Court lawyer Sudeep Srivastava has raised some questions
 bahut tarah ke sawaal hai jo ek duusare se takaraa rahe hai
 Whether the family members have said it will be proved by investigation, or it will be unilaterally dismissed from here or there through the statement
 mobile tower se pataa chal saktaa he ki koun jaj kahaan tak gaye the, koun kisase baat kar rahaa tha, loya ne kise phone kiya, patni ko kis number se phone gaya
 But all this can be revealed only by investigation when the facts and witnesses will be produced
 express kii report se saaf nahin hota he ki shav mumbai kii jagah latur ke gaategaanv bhejne kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 If wife Sharmila Loya got a call, did she know that the body would go to Gategaon, not to Mumbai
 unka parivaar latur ke aas-paas rahata he to ho saktaa he ki yah vyaavhaarik faisla ho
 But it is not known whose decision it was to move from Nagpur to Gategaon
 yah tabhi saaf hoga jab sharmila loya khud media ke saamne aakar apni sthiti saaf karengi
 Caravan has written that the call for the information of the death went to the wife as well as to the sisters and also to the father
 bahan anuraadhaa ye bataati hai ki phone par koi barde the jo apane ko jaj bataate hai, unka phone aayaa tha
 Sister Sarita also tells that a judge named Barde called
 indian express kii report main barde kaa naam saaf ho jaataa he
 He is Judge Barde
 jaj barde ko express kii report main local jaj kaha gaya he or inkaa puraa naam he jaj vijay kumaar barde
 It is in the express that Rupesh Rathi, Deputy Registrar of Nagpur Bench of High Court and Barde Justice Loya take him to Dande Hospital in a car
 kairavaan main likhaa he ki do jaj aato main jaj loya ko lekar jate hai
 It is written in the express that two judges take Judge Loya in the car
 justise sunil shukre ne kaha he ki jaj barde car khud chalaa rahe the
 Justice Gavai told our colleague Sunil Singh that he was the Senior Administrative Justice in Nagpur at that time
 express se bhi vahi kehete hai ki varisht prashaskeey jaj hone ke naate unhen hi phone kiya or tab ve apane saathi jaj sunil shukre ko lekar meditirina aspatal pahunche
 Did not even wait for my driver
 donon ravi bhawan se ek mile kii duuri par rahete the
 Local judges, deputy registrars, judge Kulkarni and Judge Modak were also there to take the judge to the hospital
 justise gawai ne sunil singh ko yah bhi bataaya he ki ravi bhawan main kul paanch kamare book the magar raat main teenon ne ek hi kamare main rahanaa pansad kiya
 Because everyone's return ticket was the same and was to return to Mumbai the next morning
 mumbai se gaye donon jaj shav ke saath isliye nahin gaye kyonki ve dost kii maut ke sadame main the
 In Caravan, Anuradha Biyani has said that the two judges did not meet the family for a month and a half
 ab aap dekh rahe hai ki jab jaj loya kii bahanon ne sawaal kiya to jaj sahiban chup the
 Now the family members are silent, then Judge Sahiban is speaking
 jaanch kaa elaan abhi tak nahin hua he
 Judge Loya's son wrote a letter to the then Chief Justice saying that i am afraid that these leaders may harm any member of my family
 mere paas inase ladane kii takat nahin he
 Our life is in danger ek jaj kaa betaa chif justise ko patr likhata he
 80 days after death
 yah patr kairavaan patrika ne apane video main dikhaaya he
 After this letter, was the family given protection, why not? enditivi ke maanas ne apni report main kaha he ki ravi bhawan main kisi bhi jaj ke liye koi car desiganet nahin thi
 Some staff members of Ravi Bhavan told Manas on condition of anonymity
 yah bhi dekha janaa chahie ki ghatana ke aasapaas maharashtra vidhansabha kaa satr shuru hone vaala tha
 Was there any ambulance in Ravi Bhavan at that time
 yah sab jaanch se pataa chalegaa, media trial se nahin
 It is written in the express that Judge Loya complained of chest pain at 4 o'clock but it is a quarter past five to reach the nearest hospital by car
 subah ke vakt teen kilometre kaa faasla tay karne main kya 45 minute laganaa chahie
 The answer is not known
 ab sawaal uthta he ki jaj loya ko seene main kab dard hua
 It has different versions
 kairavaan main niranjan taakale ne likhaa he ki saadhe baarah baje seene main dard hua
 According to Anuradha Biyani, both the judges had told this to the family
 kairavaan ke anusaar postmortem report main kaha gaya he ki 4 baje dard hua or sava 6 baje maut hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai told the Indian Express that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at around 4 am
 enditivi se justise bhushan gawai ne kaha he ki saadhe teen baje jaj loya kii tabiyat karaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai has spoken to our colleague Sunil Singh
 is sandarbh main anuraadhaa biyani kaa bayaan mahatvapurn ho jaataa he ki donon jajon ne bataaya ki saadhe baarah baje seene main takalif hui
 Meaning Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni
 magar justise gawai ke anusaar to donon subah ke vakt jaj loya ko lekar aspataal gaye the
 The report of the post-mortem is important but you know what messes with the post-mortem report in this country
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki is cese main yahi hua he, main bas sandarbh ke liye bataa rahaa hum
 Who is saying the right thing will be known only through investigation
 aap bhi kisi par bevajaah shaq na karen
 Another question was answered when Sunil Singh spoke to Justice Gavai
 unke anusaar justise modak or justise kulkarani hi jaj loya ke saath gaye the
 According to Gawai, he met Judge Loya for the first time in marriage
 unke mutabik samaaroh se nikalakar teenon log gokul peth paan khaane gaye the
 The trio meant Judge Loya, Justice Kulakarni and Justice Modak went to eat paan
 justise gawai ko subah chah baje dipti register ne phone kar jaj loya ke maut kii soochna di, or tab ve meditrina aspataal gaye jahaan par justise modak, justise kulkarani, jaj barde or dipti register maujuud the
 Justice Gavai went to the ICU and there were no blood stains on his body
 maut kii soochna har jagah chah baje hai
 Sarita, another sister of Judge Loya, has told Niranjan Takle of Caravan that at five o'clock Judge Barde got a call that Brijgopal had died
 kya samay main antar ko lekar shaq kiya ja saktaa he, kam se kam media trial main nahin hona chahie
 After the report of Indian Express, there was some sensation about the printed picture of ECG
 isiji kii report main upar brijagopal lohia likhaa he or neeche kii taarikh 30 november he
 While the death occurred on November 1
 kya isiji mashin se aisi chook ho jaati he
 The hospital has said about this that the date of November 30 is visible, it may be technical fault
 ham har teen maheene par apni mashin ko ri-calibratt karte hai taaki aisi chook na ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi bich-bich main aisi gadabadi ho jaati he
 We stand by our facts
 isiji disambar ek taarikh ko hui thi
 The hospital later revealed the express, which the Express has published on its website
 kya us rose or bhi report par 30 november kii tarif chhapi thi, ye sab to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Some people started looking at ECG and started saying that ECG is normal
 hamane do doctoron se baat kii lekin ek chetavanee dhyaan main rakhiegaa
 The disease is not detected by a report, and also by a report
 yah sari baaten jaanch ke daayre main honi chahie magar ab kairavaan or express ne alag-alag varjan chaape hai to hamane do doctoron se baat kar lee
 Anuradha has told Caravan that the hospital and doctors at Dande Hospital refused to give any details of what was done, while Pinak Dande, director of Dande Hospital, spoke to the Express and gave details
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar sawaal maut ke baad kii gatividhiyon ko lekar jo soochnaaon kaa aadan pradaan ho rahaa he, usamen kai jagah samanta he, kai jagah antar he
 No question arises concretely as to whether Judge Loya would have been murdered
 postmart ke vakt kai bade jaj maujuud the
 Its description proves to be true in many ways
 hamane yah sawaal kiya tha ki postmart kaa faisla kiskaa tha, lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab aapako kanoon kii prakriya se hi milegaa
 Anuradha Biyani has told Caravan that as a doctor she knows that blood does not come out during the post-mortem and Biyani again demanded a post-mortem but Loya's friends and colleagues gathered there discouraged her saying that the case No need to further complicate
 kai adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki postmart ke samay khun nahin nikalataa lekin hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger ne forensik export dow
 Talked to KC Sharma
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ko suchit kiye bina bhi postmortem ho jaataa he
 After the post-mortem, there are many reasons why blood gets put into clothes due to many reasons
 tippaniyan Express and Caravan have another character
 ishwar baheti
 In the caravan it is described as RSS
 express main inhen jaj loya ke mitra dow
 Baheti's brother is said to be and Judge Loya was in contact with Ishwar Baheti
 magar baheti ne express or kairavaan se baat nahin kii he
 At least they should contact the media about how they got Judge Loya's phone, how he reached the family with the phone three to four days after his death, is it true that the data was blown out of the phone, the same SMS was saved
 supreme court ke vakil sudeep shrivastav ne kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 There are a wide variety of questions that clash with each other
 parivaar ke sadasyon ne jo kaha he kya use jaanch se sabit kiya jayega, yaa phir ekatarfa idhar se yaa udhar se bayaan ke zarie khaarij kar diya jayega
 From the mobile tower, we can know who the judge went to, who he was talking to, whom Loya called, who called the wife from
 magar ye sab to jaanch se hi saamne aa sakegaa jab tathy or gavaahon kii peshi hogi
 Caravan has written that the call for the information of the death went to the wife as well as to the sisters and also to the father

 Talked to KC Sharma
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ko suchit kiye bina bhi postmortem ho jaataa he
 After the post-mortem, there are many reasons why blood gets put into clothes due to many reasons
 tippaniyan Express and Caravan have another character
 ishwar baheti
 In the caravan it is described as RSS
 express main inhen jaj loya ke mitra dow
 Baheti's brother is said to be and Judge Loya was in contact with Ishwar Baheti
 magar baheti ne express or kairavaan se baat nahin kii he
 At least they should contact the media about how they got Judge Loya's phone, how he reached the family with the phone three to four days after his death, is it true that the data was blown out of the phone, the same SMS was saved
 supreme court ke vakil sudeep shrivastav ne kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 There are a wide variety of questions that clash with each other
 parivaar ke sadasyon ne jo kaha he kya use jaanch se sabit kiya jayega, yaa phir ekatarfa idhar se yaa udhar se bayaan ke zarie khaarij kar diya jayega
 From the mobile tower, we can know who the judge went to, who he was talking to, whom Loya called, who called the wife from
 magar ye sab to jaanch se hi saamne aa sakegaa jab tathy or gavaahon kii peshi hogi
 In Caravan, Anuradha Biyani has said that the two judges did not meet the family for a month and a half
 ab aap dekh rahe hai ki jab jaj loya kii bahanon ne sawaal kiya to jaj sahiban chup the
 Now the family members are silent, then Judge Sahiban is speaking
 jaanch kaa elaan abhi tak nahin hua he
 Judge Loya's son wrote a letter to the then Chief Justice saying that i am afraid that these leaders may harm any member of my family
 mere paas inase ladane kii takat nahin he
 Our life is in danger ek jaj kaa betaa chif justise ko patr likhata he
 80 days after death
 yah patr kairavaan patrika ne apane video main dikhaaya he
 After this letter, was the family given protection, why not? enditivi ke maanas ne apni report main kaha he ki ravi bhawan main kisi bhi jaj ke liye koi car desiganet nahin thi
 Some staff members of Ravi Bhavan told Manas on condition of anonymity
 yah bhi dekha janaa chahie ki ghatana ke aasapaas maharashtra vidhansabha kaa satr shuru hone vaala tha
 Was there any ambulance in Ravi Bhavan at that time
 yah sab jaanch se pataa chalegaa, media trial se nahin
 It is written in the express that Judge Loya complained of chest pain at 4 o'clock but it is a quarter past five to reach the nearest hospital by car
 subah ke vakt teen kilometre kaa faasla tay karne main kya 45 minute laganaa chahie
 The answer is not known
 ab sawaal uthta he ki jaj loya ko seene main kab dard hua
 It has different versions
 kairavaan main niranjan taakale ne likhaa he ki saadhe baarah baje seene main dard hua
 According to Anuradha Biyani, both the judges had told this to the family
 kairavaan ke anusaar postmortem report main kaha gaya he ki 4 baje dard hua or sava 6 baje maut hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai told the Indian Express that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at around 4 am
 enditivi se justise bhushan gawai ne kaha he ki saadhe teen baje jaj loya kii tabiyat karaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai has spoken to our colleague Sunil Singh
 is sandarbh main anuraadhaa biyani kaa bayaan mahatvapurn ho jaataa he ki donon jajon ne bataaya ki saadhe baarah baje seene main takalif hui
 Meaning Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni
 magar justise gawai ke anusaar to donon subah ke vakt jaj loya ko lekar aspataal gaye the
 The report of the post-mortem is important but you know what messes with the post-mortem report in this country
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki is cese main yahi hua he, main bas sandarbh ke liye bataa rahaa hum
 Who is saying the right thing will be known only through investigation
 aap bhi kisi par bevajaah shaq na karen
 Another question was answered when Sunil Singh spoke to Justice Gavai
 unke anusaar justise modak or justise kulkarani hi jaj loya ke saath gaye the
 According to Gawai, he met Judge Loya for the first time in marriage
 unke mutabik samaaroh se nikalakar teenon log gokul peth paan khaane gaye the
 The trio meant Judge Loya, Justice Kulakarni and Justice Modak went to eat paan
 justise gawai ko subah chah baje dipti register ne phone kar jaj loya ke maut kii soochna di, or tab ve meditrina aspataal gaye jahaan par justise modak, justise kulkarani, jaj barde or dipti register maujuud the
 Justice Gavai went to the ICU and there were no blood stains on his body
 maut kii soochna har jagah chah baje hai
 Sarita, another sister of Judge Loya, has told Niranjan Takle of Caravan that at five o'clock Judge Barde got a call that Brijgopal had died
 kya samay main antar ko lekar shaq kiya ja saktaa he, kam se kam media trial main nahin hona chahie
 After the report of Indian Express, there was some sensation about the printed picture of ECG
 isiji kii report main upar brijagopal lohia likhaa he or neeche kii taarikh 30 november he
 While the death occurred on November 1
 kya isiji mashin se aisi chook ho jaati he
 The hospital has said about this that the date of November 30 is visible, it may be technical fault
 ham har teen maheene par apni mashin ko ri-calibratt karte hai taaki aisi chook na ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi bich-bich main aisi gadabadi ho jaati he
 We stand by our facts
 isiji disambar ek taarikh ko hui thi
 The hospital later revealed the express, which the Express has published on its website
 kya us rose or bhi report par 30 november kii tarif chhapi thi, ye sab to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Some people started looking at ECG and started saying that ECG is normal
 hamane do doctoron se baat kii lekin ek chetavanee dhyaan main rakhiegaa
 The disease is not detected by a report, and also by a report
 yah sari baaten jaanch ke daayre main honi chahie magar ab kairavaan or express ne alag-alag varjan chaape hai to hamane do doctoron se baat kar lee
 Anuradha has told Caravan that the hospital and doctors at Dande Hospital refused to give any details of what was done, while Pinak Dande, director of Dande Hospital, spoke to the Express and gave details

 magar ye sab to jaanch se hi saamne aa sakegaa jab tathy or gavaahon kii peshi hogi
 Manas of NDTV has stated in its report that there was no car designate for any judge in Ravi Bhavan
 yah baat ravi bhawan ke kuch staff ne maanas ko naam naa lene ke shart par bataai
 It should also be seen that the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly session was about to begin around the event
 kya us vakt ravi bhawan main koi ambulance thi
 All this investigation will reveal, not through media trials
 express main likhaa he ki jaj loya ne 4 baje seene main dard kii shikaayat kii lekin car se nikatom aspataal pahunchane main paune paanch baj jate hai
 What should take 45 minutes to cover the distance of three kilometers in the morning
 iskaa jawaab maaloom nahin he
 Now the question arises when Judge Loya got chest pain
 iske alag alag varjan hai
 In Caravan, Niranjan Takle has written that he had chest pain at 12:30
 anuraadhaa biyani ke anusaar donon jajon ne yah baat parivaar ko bataai thi
 According to Caravan, the post-mortem report said that there was pain at 4 o'clock and death at 6
15 o'clock
 indian express ko justise bhushan gawai ne bataaya ki jaj loya kii kareeb 4 baje tabiyat kharaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai from NDTV has said that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at 3:30 pm
 justise bhushan gawai ne hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se baat kii he
 In this context, Anuradha Biyani's statement becomes important that both the judges said that there was a chest problem at 12:30
 matlab justise modak or justise kulkarani ne
 But according to Justice Gavai, both went to the hospital in the morning with Judge Loya
 postmortem kii report kaa mahatv he magar aap jaanate hai ki is desh main postmortem kii report ke saath kya kya khilwaad ho jate hai
 This does not mean that this is what happened in this case, i am just referring for reference
 koun sahi bol rahaa he yah to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Do not doubt anyone unnecessarily
 sunil singh ne jab justise gawai se baat kii to ek or sawaal kaa jawaab mila
 According to him, only Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni went with Judge Loya
 gawai ke mutabik pehali baar ve shaadi main jaj loya se mili the
 According to him, the three people went out of the ceremony to eat Gokul Peth Paan
 teenon kaa matlab jaj loya, justise kulkarani or justise modak paan khaane gaye the
 Justice Gavai was called by the Deputy Registrar at six in the morning to inform Judge Loya's death, and then he went to the Meditrina Hospital where Justice Modak, Justice Kulakarni, Judge Barde and Deputy Registrar were present
 justise gawai isiu main gaye the or unke sharir par kahin koon ke nishaan nahin the
 Notice of death is everywhere at six o'clock
 jaj loya kii ek or bahan sarita ne kairavaan ke niranjan taakale se kaha he ki paanch baje jaj barde kaa phone aayaa tha ki brijagopal kii maut ho chuki he
 Whether a difference in time can be doubted, at least not in a media trial
 indian express kii report ke baad isiji kii chhapi hui tasviir ko lekar thodi sansani ho gai
 Brijgopal Lohia is written in the ECG report above and the date below is 30 November
 jabaki maut ek november ko hui he
 Does the ECG machine cause such a lapse
 aspataal ne is bare main kaha he ki 30 november kii jo taarikh dikh rahi he, wo takniki kharabi ho sakati he
 We re-calibrate our machine every three months so that such omissions do not happen, but sometimes such disturbances occur in between
 ham apane tathy par kaayam hai
 The ECG took place on December 1
 aspataal ne baad main express ko bataaya he jise express ne apni website par chapa he
 Whether there was a compliment on the report on that day, on 30 November, all this will be known only by investigation
 kuch logon ne isiji ko dekhakar kahana shuru kar diya ki isiji saamaanya he
 We spoke to two doctors but keep in mind a warning
 beemaari kaa pataa ek report se nahin chalata he, or ek report se bhi chalata he
 All these things should be under scrutiny, but now Caravan and Express have printed different versions, then we talked to two doctors
 anuraadhaa ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki dande haspital ke doctoron or karmchaariyon ne kya chikitsa kii gai iskaa koi vivaran dene se haspital ne inkaar kar diya, vahiin dande hospital ke nideshak pinaak dande ne express se baat kii he or byora diya
 You will see that most of the questions are being shared about the activities after death, there is similarity in many places, there is difference in many places
 koi bhi sawaal is baat ko thos rup se uthta nahin dikhaa ki kya jaj loya kii hatya kii gai hogi
 Many big judges were present during the post-mart
 iskaa vivaran kai tarah se sahi sabit hota he
 We had asked the question of whose decision the post-mart was, but you will get the answer to this question only through the process of law
 anuraadhaa biyani ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki doctor hone ke kaaran wo jaanati hai ki postmortem ke dauraan khun nahin nikalataa or biyani ne dobaaraa postmortem kii maang kii thi lekin vahaan ikatthe loya ke doston or sahakarmiyon ne unhen hatotsahit kiya ki yah kehete hue ki maamle ko or jatil banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Many officials say that blood does not come out at the time of postmart but our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar has given forensic expert Dr
 ke si sharma se baat kii
 He said the postmortem also happens without informing the family
 postmart hone ke baad kai baar kapadon main rakt lag jaataa he jiske kai kaaran hote hai
 The comments express or kairavaan main ek or kirdaar he
 Ishwar Bahati kairavaan main ise aresas kaa bataaya gaya he
 In the Express, these were Judge Loya's friends, Dr
 baheti kaa bhai bataaya gaya he or jaj loya ishwar baheti ke sampark main the
 But Baheti has not talked to Express and Caravan
 kam se kam unhen media se sampark karnaa chahie ki unke paas jaj loya kaa phone kaise aayaa, wo maut ke teen chaar dinon baad phone lekar kaise parivaar ke paas pahunch gaye, kya yah sahi he ki phone se data uda diya gaya tha, ek hi esemes bachaa tha
 Supreme Court lawyer Sudeep Srivastava has raised some questions
 bahut tarah ke sawaal hai jo ek duusare se takaraa rahe hai
 Whether the family members have said it will be proved by investigation, or it will be unilaterally dismissed from here or there through the statement
 mobile tower se pataa chal saktaa he ki koun jaj kahaan tak gaye the, koun kisase baat kar rahaa tha, loya ne kise phone kiya, patni ko kis number se phone gaya
 But all this can be revealed only by investigation when the facts and witnesses will be produced
 yah bhi dekha janaa chahie ki ghatana ke aasapaas maharashtra vidhansabha kaa satr shuru hone vaala tha
 Was there any ambulance in Ravi Bhavan at that time

 Sarita, another sister of Judge Loya, has told Niranjan Takle of Caravan that at five o'clock Judge Barde got a call that Brijgopal had died
 kya samay main antar ko lekar shaq kiya ja saktaa he, kam se kam media trial main nahin hona chahie
 After the report of Indian Express, there was some sensation about the printed picture of ECG
 isiji kii report main upar brijagopal lohia likhaa he or neeche kii taarikh 30 november he
 While the death occurred on November 1
 kya isiji mashin se aisi chook ho jaati he
 The hospital has said about this that the date of November 30 is visible, it may be technical fault
 ham har teen maheene par apni mashin ko ri-calibratt karte hai taaki aisi chook na ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi bich-bich main aisi gadabadi ho jaati he
 We stand by our facts
 isiji disambar ek taarikh ko hui thi
 The hospital later revealed the express, which the Express has published on its website
 kya us rose or bhi report par 30 november kii tarif chhapi thi, ye sab to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Some people started looking at ECG and started saying that ECG is normal
 hamane do doctoron se baat kii lekin ek chetavanee dhyaan main rakhiegaa
 The disease is not detected by a report, and also by a report
 yah sari baaten jaanch ke daayre main honi chahie magar ab kairavaan or express ne alag-alag varjan chaape hai to hamane do doctoron se baat kar lee
 Anuradha has told Caravan that the hospital and doctors at Dande Hospital refused to give any details of what was done, while Pinak Dande, director of Dande Hospital, spoke to the Express and gave details
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar sawaal maut ke baad kii gatividhiyon ko lekar jo soochnaaon kaa aadan pradaan ho rahaa he, usamen kai jagah samanta he, kai jagah antar he
 No question arises concretely as to whether Judge Loya would have been murdered
 postmart ke vakt kai bade jaj maujuud the
 Its description proves to be true in many ways
 hamane yah sawaal kiya tha ki postmart kaa faisla kiskaa tha, lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab aapako kanoon kii prakriya se hi milegaa
 Anuradha Biyani has told Caravan that as a doctor she knows that blood does not come out during the post-mortem and Biyani again demanded a post-mortem but Loya's friends and colleagues gathered there discouraged her saying that the case No need to further complicate
 kai adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki postmart ke samay khun nahin nikalataa lekin hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger ne forensik export dow
 Talked to KC Sharma
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ko suchit kiye bina bhi postmortem ho jaataa he
 After the post-mortem, there are many reasons why blood gets put into clothes due to many reasons
 tippaniyan Express and Caravan have another character
 ishwar baheti
 In the caravan it is described as RSS
 express main inhen jaj loya ke mitra dow
 Baheti's brother is said to be and Judge Loya was in contact with Ishwar Baheti
 magar baheti ne express or kairavaan se baat nahin kii he
 At least they should contact the media about how they got Judge Loya's phone, how he reached the family with the phone three to four days after his death, is it true that the data was blown out of the phone, the same SMS was saved
 supreme court ke vakil sudeep shrivastav ne kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 There are a wide variety of questions that clash with each other
 parivaar ke sadasyon ne jo kaha he kya use jaanch se sabit kiya jayega, yaa phir ekatarfa idhar se yaa udhar se bayaan ke zarie khaarij kar diya jayega
 From the mobile tower, we can know who the judge went to, who he was talking to, whom Loya called, who called the wife from
 magar ye sab to jaanch se hi saamne aa sakegaa jab tathy or gavaahon kii peshi hogi
 Justice Gavai was called by the Deputy Registrar at six in the morning to inform Judge Loya's death, and then he went to the Meditrina Hospital where Justice Modak, Justice Kulakarni, Judge Barde and Deputy Registrar were present
 justise gawai isiu main gaye the or unke sharir par kahin koon ke nishaan nahin the
 Notice of death is everywhere at six o'clock
 jaj loya kii ek or bahan sarita ne kairavaan ke niranjan taakale se kaha he ki paanch baje jaj barde kaa phone aayaa tha ki brijagopal kii maut ho chuki he
 Whether a difference in time can be doubted, at least not in a media trial
 indian express kii report ke baad isiji kii chhapi hui tasviir ko lekar thodi sansani ho gai
 Brijgopal Lohia is written in the ECG report above and the date below is 30 November
 jabaki maut ek november ko hui he
 Does the ECG machine cause such a lapse
 aspataal ne is bare main kaha he ki 30 november kii jo taarikh dikh rahi he, wo takniki kharabi ho sakati he
 We re-calibrate our machine every three months so that such omissions do not happen, but sometimes such disturbances occur in between
 ham apane tathy par kaayam hai
 The ECG took place on December 1
 aspataal ne baad main express ko bataaya he jise express ne apni website par chapa he
 Whether there was a compliment on the report on that day, on 30 November, all this will be known only by investigation
 kuch logon ne isiji ko dekhakar kahana shuru kar diya ki isiji saamaanya he
 We spoke to two doctors but keep in mind a warning
 beemaari kaa pataa ek report se nahin chalata he, or ek report se bhi chalata he
 All these things should be under scrutiny, but now Caravan and Express have printed different versions, then we talked to two doctors
 anuraadhaa ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki dande haspital ke doctoron or karmchaariyon ne kya chikitsa kii gai iskaa koi vivaran dene se haspital ne inkaar kar diya, vahiin dande hospital ke nideshak pinaak dande ne express se baat kii he or byora diya
 You will see that most of the questions are being shared about the activities after death, there is similarity in many places, there is difference in many places
 koi bhi sawaal is baat ko thos rup se uthta nahin dikhaa ki kya jaj loya kii hatya kii gai hogi
 Many big judges were present during the post-mart
 iskaa vivaran kai tarah se sahi sabit hota he
 We had asked the question of whose decision the post-mart was, but you will get the answer to this question only through the process of law
 anuraadhaa biyani ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki doctor hone ke kaaran wo jaanati hai ki postmortem ke dauraan khun nahin nikalataa or biyani ne dobaaraa postmortem kii maang kii thi lekin vahaan ikatthe loya ke doston or sahakarmiyon ne unhen hatotsahit kiya ki yah kehete hue ki maamle ko or jatil banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Many officials say that blood does not come out at the time of postmart but our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar has given forensic expert Dr
 ke si sharma se baat kii
 He said the postmortem also happens without informing the family
 postmart hone ke baad kai baar kapadon main rakt lag jaataa he jiske kai kaaran hote hai
 The comments express or kairavaan main ek or kirdaar he
 Ishwar Bahati kairavaan main ise aresas kaa bataaya gaya he
 In the Express, these were Judge Loya's friends, Dr
 baheti kaa bhai bataaya gaya he or jaj loya ishwar baheti ke sampark main the
 But Baheti has not talked to Express and Caravan
 kam se kam unhen media se sampark karnaa chahie ki unke paas jaj loya kaa phone kaise aayaa, wo maut ke teen chaar dinon baad phone lekar kaise parivaar ke paas pahunch gaye, kya yah sahi he ki phone se data uda diya gaya tha, ek hi esemes bachaa tha
 Supreme Court lawyer Sudeep Srivastava has raised some questions
 bahut tarah ke sawaal hai jo ek duusare se takaraa rahe hai
 Whether the family members have said it will be proved by investigation, or it will be unilaterally dismissed from here or there through the statement
 mobile tower se pataa chal saktaa he ki koun jaj kahaan tak gaye the, koun kisase baat kar rahaa tha, loya ne kise phone kiya, patni ko kis number se phone gaya
 But all this can be revealed only by investigation when the facts and witnesses will be produced
 kya samay main antar ko lekar shaq kiya ja saktaa he, kam se kam media trial main nahin hona chahie
 After the report of Indian Express, there was some sensation about the printed picture of ECG

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation on 8 November 2016
 piem modi ne ise kaale dhan ke khilaaf ladaai bataaya
 On the lines of India, some other countries also wanted to make note ban a weapon against black money
 unhone bhi piem modi ke is formule ko apnaane kii koshish kii
 But the way in which demonetisation got the support of people in India, the situation in these countries was different
 in deshon ne kii notebandi kii koshishnovember main bharat kii taraf se notebandi kii ghoshnaa karne ke ek maheene baad hi disambar main teen deshon main notebandi kii koshish hui
 The countries that tried to ban demonetisation on the lines of India included Pakistan, Australia and Venezuela
 yahaan nahin bani batbharat main notebandi ke baad disambar main pakistan kii sansad main 1000 or 5000 pakistani rupye ke note band karne kaa ek prastaav laayaa gaya
 The proposal was introduced in Parliament by MP Osman Saifullah Khan
 unhone bharat kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha tha ki in noton ko band karne se kaledhan par lagaam kasne main madad milegi
 According to the Dawn newspaper report, the government gave clarification on this only a week after the protest started by the general public
 tatkaaleen paak vitt mantri mohammad ishaak daar ne saaf kiya ki sarkaar kisi bhi aise prastaav par vichaar nahin kar rahi or ye note band nahin ho rahe

 Due to this decision, long lines started coming out of banks like India
 vahiin, sarkaar ke is faisle kaa bade str par virodh bhi shuru ho gaya
 The Venezuelan government withdrew the decision of demonetisation in view of the people's opposition
 venezuela iske jariye lagaataar badhati mahangaai dar par niyantran paanaa chahta tha, lekin isamen sarkaar kaamyaab nahin ho pai
 Also read: Has demonetization proved to be a flop? After the RBI figures, the opposition attacker, Jaitley gave the task force, Australia created a task force, a month after the demonetisation in India, Australia also formed a task force to consider banning $ 100 notes
 australia kii revenue ministar keli o'doir ne abisi radio se kaha tha ki cirkulation main 100 dollar ke noton kii sankhya kaaphi zyada he
 He had informed that the task force would consider banning $ 100 notes and reducing cash transactions

 nris coming to India had to face a lot of trouble after the news of the closure of 100 dollar notes in Australia
 yahaan koi 100 dollar ke note lene ko taiyaar nahin hua
 In view of this, Australian High Commissioner in India Harinder Sidhu issued a statement clarifying that the Australian Government has no such plans

 Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party government implemented aud-even from November 4 to 15 to improve air quality in the capital Delhi
 is sarkaar ke kaarykaal main teesri baar he jab vaayu pradooshan kam karne ke liye od-ivan lagu kiya gaya he
 By reducing the number of vehicles on the roads by implementing aud-even, the government hopes that this will reduce pollution
 haalanki, aankade kuch or kahani kehete hai
 India Today's Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) analyzed the air quality index during the implementation of audi-even and found that the aud-even scheme, like earlier efforts, did not help Delhi's air quality improve
 Received DIU ne 4-15 november kaa subah ke 8 baje se lekar shaam ke 8 baje ke bich kaa aankada liya or in aankadon kii november, 2018 kii isi avadhi ke aankadon ke saath tulana kii jab od-ivan lagu nahin tha
 All these figures are from the National Air Quality Index of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
 dilli kaa dam ghutaiai ke aankadon kaa vishleshan se saamne aayaa ki is saal od-ivan lagu hone ke dauraan dilli kii hawa kii gunvattta main koi sudhaar nahin hua
 The average AQI between November 4 and 15 was 362
 2018 main isi avadhi main jab od-ivan lagu nahin tha, tab kaa ausat AQI 335 tha
 Simply put, Delhi's air quality during the implementation of odd-even was 8 percent worse than last year
 CPCB ke maanakon ke muta bik, agar AQI 300 se upar ho to hawa kii gunvattta 'bahut kharaab' kii shrenee main aati he or lambey samay tak aisi hawa main saans lene se logon ko saans se judi bimaariyaan ho sakati hai
 Are Diwali and Parali the causes of pollution? Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said that the deterioration of air quality in North India has a 'deep connection' with burning of stubble
 DIU ne paaya ki pichley saal kii isi avadhi se kii tulana main is baar jis samay od-ivan lagu tha, us dauraan paraali jalaane main kami darj kii gai he
 Data from nasa's FIRMS project say that between 4 and 15 November 2018, 32000 incidents of stubble burning were reported in North India
 2019 main is avadhi main sirf kareeb 25000 ghatnaayen darj hui hai
 The most important thing is that last year, Diwali was on 7 November
 dilli main diwali ke baad ke dinon main pradooshan bad jaataa he, baavjood iske us samay kaa AQI is saal ke od-ivan dinon kii tulana main behatar tha
 DIU had earlier reported that odd-even may have overcome the problem of traffic jam in Delhi, but due to this no improvement in air quality has been reported
 aam aadmi party netaa raghav chaddha ne kaha ki od-ivan ne hawa kii gunvattta ke "or bhi bigadane" ko niyantrit karne main madad kii
 He told India Today, "the odd-even scheme was an emergency measure and was implemented at the suggestion of the Environment Pollution (prevention and Control) Authority
 is yojana se hawa kii gunvattta bhale hi 'bahut kharaab' se 'madhyam' shrenee kii nahin hui, lekin isaki madad se ise or kharaab hone se rokane main madad mili
 "so what is the cause of pollution? CPCB says that air quality depends on a lot of meteorological dynamic factors which often change according to geographical locations
 mukhyat: hawa kii gati, hawa kii disha or taapmaana kisi jagah kii hawa kii gunvattta tay karte hai
 In 2016, CPCB submitted its report on the implementation of the odd-even scheme
 isamen kaha gaya ki “vaahanon samet vibhinn sroton se utsarjan ke alaava kai mausam sambandhi kaarak jaise ki mixing hit (jis oonchai par hawa main pradooshak tatv jamaa hote hai), hawa kii gati, taapmaana, saura vikiran, saapekshik ardrata aadi milakar yah tay karte hai ki pradooshan kaa str kya rahegaa
 The reduction in vehicular emissions is not sufficient to affect the data analyzed

 " maujuuda samay main yuva cricketron ke bich test cricket kaa charm kam hota ja rahaa he, lekin under-19 world cap vijeta team india ke captain rahe unmukt chand kaa maananaa he ki tii-20 bhale yuva khilaadiyon ko lokapriyata dilaane vaala manch ho, lekin test khelnaa sabhi yuva cricketron kaa sapana hota he
 Unmukt, who plays for the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League (IPL), feels that it is very difficult to remove Test cricket from a young player
 unhone kaha ki vaise to cricket ke teenon formet jaruri hai, lekin test cricket kisi bhi khilaadi ke liye hameshaa sabase mahatvapurn hota he
 Unmukt said, 'we play all formats of cricket at the domestic level
 gharelu pratiyogitaaon main ranjai trophy ko zyada mahatv diya jaataa he, jisase aap kisi khilaadi ke andar se test cricket ko na nikaal paaen

 i myself gained a lot by playing for the Royals

 i think everything depends on the confidence of the player
 'unmukt ne kaha, 'team ke sabhi khilaadi anbhavi hai or unhen pataa he ki kya karnaa he

 ' In the auction for the IPL-10 season, young all-rounder Pawan Negi was sold for only Rs 1 crore
 pawan negi ko is baar royal chalangers bengaluru ne kharida he
 Last year, the young Delhi player made headlines when Delhi Daredevils placed a big 8 on him
 5 karod rupee main kharida tha
 Last season, Pawan was the highest paid player among Indian players and Yuvraj Singh of Chandigarh also lagged behind him
 pawan negi baayen haath se spin gendbaaji karne ke alaava acchhee ballebaaji bhi kar lete hai
 In this sense, he is considered a very useful player of T20
 tippaniyan Surprisingly, Negi's base price was kept at only Rs 30 lakh in IPL season-9, but he was 28
 33 guna zyada matlab 8
 Sold for Rs 5 crores
 un par dilli dairedevills ne daanv lagaaya tha
 It is a different matter that this 24-year-old youth could not meet expectations
 negi ne 8 maichon main mahaj 57 ran banaae, unka ausat 28
 50 and strike rate 96
 61 rahaa
 He took one wicket and 9 in bowling
 33 ke iconomi rate se ran kharch kiye
 This is the reason that this time their price was underestimated and they were auctioned for just one crore rupees
 pawan negi ek tii20 match main team india kaa pratinidhitiv kar chuke hai
 He did not get a chance to bat in this match against UAE
 gendbaaji main unhone 16 ran dekar ek wicket hasil kiya tha
 Pawan has also represented Chennai Super Kings in the IPM
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki ipel sijan-9 main negi kii base price keval 30 lakh rupee rakhi gai thi, lekin vah 28
 33 times more mean 8
 5 karod rupee main bike
 He was betted by Delhi Daredevils
 yah baat alag he ki 24 saal kaa yah yuva apekshaaon par khara nahin utar paaya tha
 Negi scored just 57 runs in 8 matches, averaging 28
 50 or strike rate 96
 Remained 61
 gendbaaji main unhone ek wicket liya or 9
 Spent runs at an economy rate of 33
 yahi kaaran he ki is baar unki keemat kaaphi kam aanki gai or sirf ek karod rupee main ve nilaam hue
 Pawan Negi has represented Team India in a T20 match
 yuai ke khilaaf is match main unhen ballebaaji kaa mauka nahin mila tha
 In bowling, he took one wicket for 16 runs

 php According to sources, Mulayam Singh had asked CM Akhilesh to return Shivpal's old department but he did not listen
 isse pehle parivaar kaa jhagada khulkar saamne aane ke baad sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav guuruuvaar shaam dilli se lakhanu pahunche or apane bete or mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav or bhai shivpal yadav se milakar kalah ko nipataane kii koshish shuru kii
 The comments jaise hi mulaayam yahaan pahunche unhone shivpal ko talab kiya or halaat ko saamaanya banane ke liye band kamare main unke saath baithak kii
 Shivpal later met Akhilesh at his official residence
 sutron ne bataaya ki mulaayam ke nirdesh par donon ke bich kareeb 20 minute tak baithak hui
 Earlier, Mulayam's cousin and SP national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav had said, "everything will be alright once he (mulayam) arrives here
" unki baat antim hogi
 "earlier in the day, Ram Gopal had met the Chief Minister and claimed, 'akhilesh is not angry with anyone and Netaji's (mulayam) decision is the last in the party
 " As soon as Mulayam reached here he summoned Shivpal and held a meeting with him in a closed room to make the situation normal
 shivpal ne baad main akhilesh se unke aadhikarik nivas par mulaakaat kii
 Sources said the two met for about 20 minutes on Mulayam's instructions
 isse pehle mulaayam ke chachere bhai or sapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv ramgopal yadav ne kaha tha, "unke (mulaayam) yahaan pahunchane ke baad sabakuch thik ho jayega
 His talk will be final
 " isse pehle din main ramgopal ne mukhyamantri se mulaakaat kii thi or daawa kiya tha, 'akhilesh kisi se bhi naaraaz nahin hai or netaji (mulaayam) kaa faisla party main antim he
 " isse pehle mulaayam ke chachere bhai or sapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv ramgopal yadav ne kaha tha, "unke (mulaayam) yahaan pahunchane ke baad sabakuch thik ho jayega

 " ayodhya prakaran kii divaani yachika par supreme court main 29 aktubar se sunwaayee shuru ho rahi he
 So, the Sangh Parivar is also increasing the pressure to build Ram temple in Ayodhya before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ne khud hi yah raag ched diya he
 Within a fortnight, he has already talked about starting the construction of Ram temple immediately
 haridwar main 2 aktubar ko sadhu swadhyay sangam shivi ke abhibhaashan main unhone elaan kiya, "har haal main ram mandir banaaya jayega
 a few days after that, in the rss's annual Vijayadashami speech in Nagpur on October 18, he said, "babur had hurt our self-respect by demolishing the temple
" isliye ram mandir kaa nirmaan hamaare swabhimaan ko behaal karne ke liye anivaary he
 It should be constructed at Ram Janmabhoomi as soon as possible
 hamaara isamen puraa samarthan rahegaa
 "the next day on October 19, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath visited the controversial site in Ayodhya and declared that Ayodhya is also a matter of" my personal faith "
 is bich, antarrashtriya hindu parishad ke mukhiya praveen togdipha bhi ayodhya yatra kii shuruyaat karke mandir nirmaan ko maahaul garmane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Although it can be said that he has not got much success in this
 arthvyavastha gart main ghota laga chuki he or pradhanmantri narendra modi kii aparaajey chhavi kaaphi jhatka kha chuki he, aise main ram mandir ke pairokaron ke liye apane agenda ko aage badhaane kaa yah aakhri mauka lagata he
 Probably for this reason, now these people want that the issue should be resolved not by a court decision but by making a law
 bhagwat ne nagpur main kaha, "yah sabit ho chukaa he ki us jameen ke neeche mandir tha
 Some political elements are trying to complicate the judicial process by complicating it so that the matter is constantly deferred
 agar isamen raajnneeti nahin hoti to mandir kaaphi pehle ban chukaa hota
 Now the government should make laws for this
 ''yahi nahin, ayodhya main ram mandir ke nirmaan ke liye vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) kii 16 sadasyeey sant ucchadhikaar samiti ne 5 aktubar (vihip) ko apni baithak main adhyadesh laane kii maang tak rakh di
 The VHP proposal concludes, "if the temple is not built under Prime Minister Narendra Modi (in Delhi) and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath (in Lucknow), it will never be built
 ''haalanki babari masjid acshan cameti ke sanyojak varisht vakil jafarayab jilani kehete hai ki adhyadesh laana to sambhav nahin he
 According to him, “the matter is in court
 jab tak supreme court apana faisla nahin sunaata, is maamle main koi sarkaar kisi tarah kaa kanoon nahin laa sakati
 Therefore, any such initiative will be challenged in the court on this occasion
 ''congress saansad tathaa main hindu kyon hum kitaab ke lekhak shashi tharur ne 15 aktubar ko ek sahitya samaaroh main yah kahkar ek nai chinagaari oochaal di ki "koi bhi acha hindu kisi or ke poojasthal ko todakar mandir bananaa nahin chahega
 "but the people of the Sangh Parivar seem adamant on their take
 darasal, vihip ke prastaav main yah sankalp he ki agar sarkaar kuch nahin karti he, to ve yah maamla apane haath main le lenge
 The proposal states, "if the government does not set a deadline, then the option of agitation and rebellion remains
 '' vibhinn hindu mathon or akhaadon ke santon ne kaha he ki ve jaldi hi mandir nirmaan ke liye andolan shuru karenge, agle maheene sabhi rajyon ke rajyapalon se milenge or 18 disambar ke baad har math or hindu puja sthalon par ram mandir ke liye hafte bhar kaa kaarykram chalaayenge
 On the other hand, the reconstituted bench of the Supreme Court will hear the Ayodhya civil case from October 29
 use elahabaad hycourt ke 30 sitambar, 2010 ke faisle ke khilaaf 14 yachikaaon par faisla sunaanaa he
 The three-member Lucknow bench of the High Court won a majority of 2-1
 77 acre vivaadaaspad jameen ko teen pakshon ramalala, sunni vakf board or nirmohi akhaada main baraabar-baraabar baant diya tha
 Ramlala is represented by the All India Hindu Mahasabha
 in sabhi teenon pakshon ne hycourt ke faisle ke khilaaf sarvocch adaalat main yachika daayar kii he (dekhen boxh shuru hogi sunwaayee or vaadi-prativaadee)
 Then, on July 23 this year, there was a new twist in the case
 supreme court ne ayodhya nivasee buddha vineet kumaar maury kii yachika sweekaar kar lee
 This petition has demanded that the court direct the government to "declare the disputed land as Ayodhya Buddhist Vihara" under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958
 is yachika par bhi sunwaayee 29 aktubar ko shuru hogi
 In this way, a new side has been added to the case and this may complicate matters
 haalanki sabase pehle to nae pradhan nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi ko is maamle kii sunwaayee karne vaali teen jajon kii peeth kaa punargathan karnaa hoga
 It will have to bring in another judge in place of former Chief Justice Deepak Mishra
 nyaayamurti gogoi agar chahen to peeth ke baaki do jajon ko bhi badal sakate hai
 According to advocate Dushyant Dave, Justice Gogoi can also decide whether to preserve the judgment in the matter till the 2019 general elections or if it is declared before the elections
 iske pehle nyaayamurti mishra kii aguai main teen jajon kii peeth sunni vakf board ke vakil kapil sibbal, rajeev dhawan vagairah kaa yah aagrah thukraa chuki he ki is maamle kii sunwaayee july 2019 tak taal di jaae
 Sibal argued, "the political consequences of this decision are going to be widespread
 sunwaayee main teji achaanak ek aise vyakti (bhaajapa rajyasabha sadsy subrahmanyam swami samajhen) kii apil se ai he jo iskaa pakshakaar bhi nahin he
 Through this, a party (ie BJP) is trying to carry forward its manifesto promise
 adaalat ko is jaal main nahin funsana chahie
 This is just an attempt to trap him
 '' sibbal ne yah daleel bhi di ki yah desh ke itihaas main sabase ahm mukadmaa he isliye isaki sunaavi saat nahin to kam se kam paanch jajon kii peeth ko hi kerani chahie
 On 27 September last month, former Chief Justice Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan and S
K
 abdul nazeer kii peeth ne 2-1 ke bahumat se dow
 M
 ismail faruki banaam centre maamle main 24 aktubar, 1994 ke supreme court ke faisle par punarvichaar yachika ko badi peeth ke hawaale karne se inkaar kar diya
 That decision relates to whether the Indian state has the right to acquire any shrine i
e
 temple, mosque or church
 1994 main supreme court kii paanch jajon kii peeth ne faisla sunaaya tha ki us jameen ko adhigrahan karne kaa sarkaar kaa kadam jaij tha, jahaan masjid thi kyonki masjid islam ke anuyaayiyon ke liye apane majahab ke anupaalan kaa anivaary hissaa nahin he
 The court said that praying is absolutely essential for the observance of religion but that every place where prayer is offered is not an essential part of religion unless it is of "special importance" for that religion
 is tarah jajon ne faisla sunaaya ki masjid "islam ke anupaalan ke liye anivaary hissaa nahin he or musalmaan log kahin bhi, khule main bhi namaaj adaa kar sakate hai
 With this plea, on September 27, a three-judge bench headed by the then Chief Justice Mishra upheld the 1994 verdict and refused to refer a larger bench to reconsider it
 peeth ne apane bahumat ke faisle main kaha ki 1994 kaa faisla ayodhya main vivaadaaspad jameen ke adhigrahan se sambandhit tha, na ki uskaa sambandh kisi dharmik maamle se he
 Not only this, according to this decision of the Supreme Court, it has nothing to do with the dispute over the ownership of the disputed land in Ayodhya and hence it does not need to be handed over to a large bench
 haalanki supreme court ke 1994 ke faisle ko galat maanakar us par punarvichaar karne kii apil karne vaale ek pakshakaar em
 Senior advocate Rajiv Dhawan, appearing for Siddiqui, argued, "A majority decision will please the majority and a minority decision will please the minority
 isse jis samasya par hamane vichaar shuru kiya tha, uskaa koi hal nahin nikalegaa
 "in this way, he pleaded to reconsider the 1994 verdict and said that this entire matter must be referred to a larger bench
" iske pehle varisht vakil ke
 Parasaran & c
 es
 Vaidyanathan opposed the reconsideration of the 1994 verdict on the grounds that the verdict had nothing to do with the controversial land ownership case
 supreme court ke is nae faisle par vihip ke kaaryakari adhyaksh alok kumaar ne kaha, "main santusht hum ki yah apil khaarij ho gai
 This has now cleared the way for the hearing of petitions related to Ram Janmabhoomi
 ''subrahmanyam swami pehle hi yah kah chuke hai ki ve maamle kii sunwaayee main teji laane ke liye supreme court main nai yachika lekar jaaenge
 His plea for this petition is that his basic right to follow and propagate his religion is much larger than the general property rights of the Sunni Waqf Board
 isliye unhen pehle mandir nirmaan kii ijaajat milani chahie
 However, the Sangh Parivar and its associated Hindu religious organizations are no longer in the mood to wait for a court verdict or any government initiative
 unhen lagata he ki yahi makul mauka he
 Togadia said, "when we started the agitation in 1984, the matter was in court
 kisi bijipivale ne nahin kaha ki maamla adaalat main he
 Advani ji took out a rath yatra
 '' isse bhaajapa ko rashtriya raajnneeti main sthapit hone main madad mili thi
 Therefore, the political message of this campaign is also clear
 aakhir, ab phir chunavi mausam he
 Time to move fast
 phir ayodhya gemeanger sabit ho saktaa he, khaskar jab "janeudhari shiv or ram bhakt'' rahul gandhi bhi udaar hindu kaa raag alaapne lage hai

 It seems that Shivraj Singh Chauhan has started beating Bhishma Pitamah LK Advani of BJP more than Modi
 alam ye he ki kabhi har pal modi kii tarifon ke pul baandhne vaale adwani ab shivaraj ke gungan main lage hai
 The reason is that this PM is not the result of the ongoing tug of war on waiting
 lok sabha ke chunaav ke liye jo team taiyaar hui he usamen modi kii khub chali he, kya ye he modi se dar kii vajah
 Advani, comparing Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, termed the two as arrogant, while comparing Shivraj to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi for development
 adwani ne nagar-gram kendron ke paalkon or sanyojakon ke sammelan ke samaapan ke avasar par kaha ki vaajapeyi ne apane kaarykaal main (jab vaajapeyi pradhanmantri the) main pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana, rashtriya rajmargon kaa nirmaan or unnayan, parmaanu pareekshan, kisaan credit card se lekar anek yojanayen shuru kin lekin hameshaa ve ahankaar se dur rahe
 Comparing the tenure of Prime Ministers till date in the country, he claimed that Vajpayee's tenure was the best and successful among them
 adwani ne kaha ki isi prakaar chouhan ne janata ke kalyaan ke liye ladli lakshmi or mukhyamantri tirth darshan sahit anek kalyakaari yojanayen lagu kii
 He said that Madhya Pradesh is achieving new heights of development with the imagination of Shivraj Singh
 modi ke liye dilli dur he
 Advani did not say that he was retiring
 adwani ne abtak ye bhi nahin kaha he ki wo piem kii res main nahin hai
 It was believed that Modi would jump into the active politics of Delhi from the Karnataka elections, but he missed only two days for campaigning and even two election committee meetings
 aise maukey par jab hafte bhar main bijepi kii kaaryakarini kii baithak hone vaali ho tab adwani kaa ye bayaan yun hin nahin ho saktaa
 The political meaning of this statement will be derived

 '- inputaniansh Can a man conceive without medical help? kya kisi purush ke pet main baccha ho saktaa he
 The answer will surely be no, but there is a Baba from Firozabad who is claiming that he has a 6-month-old baby in his stomach
 ham aaj baba ke pet kii paheli kaa rajfash karne vaale hai lekin usase pehle aapke liye ye jaananaa jaruri he ki aakhir ye baba daawa kya kar rahe hai
 This person, known as Pawan Baba, describes himself as the monk of Juna Arena and is claiming that he has a child in his stomach
 firozabad ke doulatpur kasbe kaa rahane vaala pawan baba jab se ye sansanikhej daawa kar rahaa he
 There is a crowd of people watching him
 sabaki najar baba ke pet par tik gai he or baba bhi bade vistaar se garbhadhaaran karne kii apni ajeebogareeb kahani ko sunaane se peeche nahin hat rahe hai
 His story starts a few months ago and stays on by visiting a saint-mahatma
 firozabad or aas-paas ke ilaake main pawan baba hairat or aashcharya kaa vishay ban chuke hai
 There is only one question on everyone's tongue, how can a father become a man
 koi purush kaise palat saktaa he kudarat ke kanoon ko
 However, there is no dearth of people who consider Baba's story as the biggest hypocrisy
 baba kaa kahana he ki unhen baccha hoga or wo bhi avtari
 Surprise is happening on Baba's words and it is also surprising that this claim of Baba was loudly raised in some circles of the media
 aisa bataane kii koshish kii gai ki baba jo kuch bhi kah rahaa he wo galat nahin sahi he
 But being a responsible channel, Aaj Tak pledged to investigate the reality of this Baba's stomach
 dharm or ishwar kii duhai dekar hindustan kii janata ko murkh banane vaale kai baabaaon kii pehle bhi ajtak ne pole kholi he
 So we tried to know how much truth is there in what Pawan Baba is claiming
 sabase pehle ham pahunche ilaake ke doctor ke paas
 The doctor clearly stated that no man can have a child without the help of science
 hamaari padtaal yaheen khatm nahin hui
 We started keeping a close watch on Baba's statement and every activity, because we were determined that Pawan Baba is making claims about how much power he has
 kya vaaki unke pet main baccha he yaa phir baba ke dimag kaa koi fitur
 Aaj Tak brought Pawan Baba from Firozabad to Delhi to carry out his investigation
 hamaare samaane bhi sirf ek hi sawaal tha ki sristi or kudarat ke banaae niyam kaa ulanghan kaise ho saktaa he
 Pawan Baba had not yet been examined by the doctor, so we took him directly for an ultrasound to a large hospital in Delhi
 doctoron ne hamaare saamne baba kaa ultrasound karnaa shuru kiya
 This process of investigation was over after Baba's ultrasound went on for a few minutes
 baba ke pet kii ultrasound report hamaare saamne aa chuki he
 The truth had come in front of us and the secret of Baba's stomach and the reality of his claim had been destroyed
 ultrasound report ne saaf kar diya he ki june akhaade ke sadhu pawan baba ke pet main koi bhi baccha nahin he
 Pawan Baba has not conceived and all the things of Baba are just concocted
 baba ke pet main baccha nahin fat yani charbi he
 Fat is high, so the stomach is bloated
 foole hue pet kii vajah se baba ke dimag main paidaa hua fitur ki wo pregnant hai
 With this, Aaj Tak has removed all the claims of Pawan Baba
 ajtak ne pawan baba ko benakaab kar diya
 It is clear that Pawan Baba had been saying repeatedly about conceiving for the last 6 months, there is no truth in that
 aakhir kudarat ke is kanoon ko koi kaise badal saktaa he

 Whereas, both the parties are trying their luck in the election battle together

 ek mahila or uske do maasoom bacchon kii jaan letaa he or jate-jate ghar ke daravaaje par baahar se taala lagaakar chalaa jaataa he
 The story of Huitripal Murder in West Delhi's Uttam Nagar area has confused the police
 kaatil ghar main ghusata he
 a 34-year-old woman living there and her two innocent children die, but is locked out of the flat on the go
 taala, wo bhi unheen ke ghar kaa
 When Custom and Excise Inspector Amit Kumar returned from work this day, a shocking news awaited him
 unhen pehali baar tab hairaani hui, jab unhone apane ghar main baahar se taala laga hua dekha
 He felt that perhaps his wife and children had gone out without telling him
 lihaaja, wo kuch der ke liye ek padosi ke ghar chale gaye
 But when he returned after a while, the situation was the same
 jal rahi thim ghar kii battiyansmit pehle apni bivi ke mobile par kol karte hai
 But despite calling several successive times, when they do not get any response, they get restless
 amit kii bechaini kii ek vajah ye bhi he ki ghar ke andar tamaam battiyaan jal rahi hai or pankhons ke chalane kii aawaaj bhi aa rahi he
 But despite repeatedly ringing the bell and calling, no one is speaking from inside
 ab amit padosiyon ko ye baat bataate hai or phir bagalvaale flats se kudakar apane flats ke andar daakhil hote hai
 On the other hand, neighbors try to break the lock of the house
 lekin andar kaa manjar dekhte hi amit ke hosh ud jate hai
 They sit there on the floor and start crying
 ghar main tinlashenpadi hai
 Amit's 34-year-old wife Deepa, 9-year-old son Saksham and 6-year-old daughter Vaishnavi
 tab tak aas-pados ke log bhi amit ke ghar main daakhil ho chuke hote hai, lekin andar kaa manjar dekhakar har kisi ke rongte khadey ho jate hai
 Wife's corpse lying in the bedroom was lying on the bedroom floor and a sardine was wrapped around her neck
 unke do bacchon kii laash bathroom main thi
 But the wounds on the blood and body scattered around the bathroom testify that both the children have been slaughtered
 ab fouran police ko vaardaat kii ittila di jaati he
 Since the case is of triple murder
 local thane kii police ke saath-saath kai bade afasar mauka-e-vaardaat par pahunchate hai
 The effort to gather evidence and search for clues intensifies
 lekin sawaal ye hai ki aakhir in teenon kaa katl kisne kiya? kyon kiya? kya ye amit yaa phir deepa se kisi kii dushmani kaa nateeja tha? lutpaat kii koshish kaa? yaa phir vajah koi or thi? lekin sabase bada sawaal ye tha ki aakhir kaatil ne jate-jate ghar main taala kyon lagaaya?aage padhie mauka-e-vaardaat se mili 5 ahm suraag
 
 
 Clue number one killer, of course, locked the house from outside, but before the murder he had no difficulty in entering the house
 matlab ye ki second floor par maujuud is flats main kaatil jis tarah aaraam se daakhil hua usase is baat kaa ishaara miltaa he ki kaatil amit kumaar kii patni deepa ko jaanane vaala tha kyonki naa to kisi ne vahaan kisi jor-jabardastee kaa koi shor suna or naa hi baad main daravaaje par aise koi nishaan hi mili
 As the clue number goes, the murderer locks the door from outside, it also indicates that the murderer was probably aware of Deepa or Amit, who kept this incident hidden from the eyes of people for a long time
 Wanted
 itnaa hi nahin, use ghar main rakhe taale kaa bhi pataa tha kyonki ghar ke baahar jo taala laga tha, use kaatil apane saath lekar nahin aayaa tha, balki wo unheen ke ghar main rakhaa taala tha
 Clue number three mouka-e-vardat also cleared that there was no looting in the house as there was no scattered items in the house
 aise main kaatil jo bhi tha, wo deepa kii jaan hi lenaa chahta tha
 That is, the motive for the murder was not looting, but enmity
 suraag number charsutron kaa kahana he ki amit or deepa ke donon bachche shaam sava chah baje tak baahar khelte hue dekhe gaye the
 During this time his daughter Vaishnavi was hurt by a fall and then both of her children were advised by a neighbor to go home
 isi ke baad bachche upar apane flats main chale gaye
 But when Amit returned to his house for the first time around seven in the evening, he saw his house locked
 yani kaatil ne shaam saadhe chah se saat baje ke bich hi vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 Assuming clue number five police, the murderer of the murderer can be from either Amit or Deepa
 mumkin he dushmani donon se ho, lekin kaatil kaa nishaanaa shaayad deepa hi thi kyonki kaatil shaam ko saadhe chah baje aas-paas unke ghar pahunchaa tha, jabaki amit har roj takreeban saat baje ke baad hi ghar pahunchate hai
 The Delhi Police, which is engaged in solving this murder mystery, entangled in the lock of the murderer, is currently taking the investigation further by keeping some of these things in mind
 wo ye jaananaa chaahati he ki aakhir is katl kii vajah kya he? or kaatil kii deepa yaa phir amit se aakhir kya dushmani he? kuch inhen soch ke saath police ab custom inspector amit kumaar or uski patni deepa kii har us movement kaa pataa laga rahi he, jo pichley ek hafte ke dauraan donon kii rahi he
 Just this thunder, along with interrogation of both the family members, neighbors and Amit, the police is also investigating the call details of their telephone
 police maanati he ki katl kii vajah rishton kii pech bhi ho sakati he
