 4ever) onjan 4, 2019 at 10:25pm pstxipika or ranvir saal 2018 november main shaadi ke bandhan main bandhe
 After marriage, both Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh are back to work
 deepika padukon meghna gulzaar ke nirdesan main ban rahi apni agali film 'chhapaak' main najar aaengi
 This film is the story of Laxmi Aggarwal, an acid attack survivor
 vahiin ranvir singh kii baat karen to unki filmasimbabox offis par dhamal machaa rahi he aurfilmako darshakon dwaara kaaphi pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 The city is the best for everyone
 jisaki har jagah par sabakaa daawa hota he
 People made Mumbai because Mumbai was claimed by all
 daawa he
 The story of Mumbai's footpath comes as a home in films and in literature, as a hideout from where one rises to become a star in the sky
 shri 420 se lekar diwaar or tejaab
 Don't know how many films are there
 jab usee mumbai main koi apni dukaan ke baahar khaali jagah main lohe keelein lagava de, to vah keel mumbai kii aatma main thonk detaa he
 Then when the picture of Keel came on Twitter, those people who believed in the soul of Mumbai were shocked
 vaise to in keelon ko ab hataa diya gaya he leki ise lagane ke peeche kaa iraadaa kitna asamvedansheel rahaa hoga
 The place left after the shutter is called oat, people sit there
 thak jate hai to tik jate hai
 Nails were installed outside HDFC Bank's Fort Road branch, which has now been removed by the bank
 bank ne afsos bhi zaahir kiya he
 The nails were already there but were enlarged after new construction
 ye keelein bhayanak hai, bahut dinon tak shahar main garibon ke liye spes ko lekar adhyayan karne waalon ke zahan se nahin hatengi
 Will be prickling
 aaj kaa shahari bharat kya itnaa garib virdohi hota chalaa jayega, daramil hota chalaa ja rahaa he
 We grab the pavement land for parking, put an iron gate on the public roads of the colony, but we will reach to such an extent that we will put a nail on the seating area so that no tired man can sit in a small place 
 bharat hi nahin duniya ke tamaam bade shaharon main beghar rahete hai
 In the face of the weather, they make their hideout in a park, under a tree, under a flyover
 bahut se log inhen gandagi ke rup main dekhte hai, atikaraman ke rup main dekhte hai, kanoon vyavastha kii samasya ke rup main dekhte hai
 What will you do, California is a city in the United States, this city has become very expensive due to tax
 itnaa mahangaa ki ghar vaale beghar ho jate hai
 They spend the night in the car and sell their house and are running towards another city
 july 2016 se july 2017 ke bich 1 lakh 38 hazaar logon ne california shahar chhod diya
 So there is no need to shrink the nose eyebrow by looking at the homeless, those who have houses can also become homeless
 par vahaan kaa samaaj kis tarah se apane begharon ko dekhtaa he
 Seattle Pacific University told the homeless that you should stay on our campus for 90 days of winter, set up your camp there
 uske baad washington uniwarsity ne bhi aisa kiya he
 Have you seen any university in India do this so that it opens its campus for the homeless in winter
 sietal pacific uniwarsity ne apane parking main 65 begharon ko camp lagane ke liye jagah de di thi
 We are putting that nail on
 behatar he ki ham aise shahar kii kalpana karen jo begharon ko lekar udaar ho
 Takes care of them tabhi to sardi ke dinon main sarkaar rain baseraa banaati he to sabko acha lagata he
 Now have you seen the spikes outside the HDFC branch in Mumbai but is it not happening in Delhi
 dilli main bhi ho rahaa he magar duusari taraf se
 You must have noticed that the entire part of the flyover in Delhi is being closed by installing a grill
 aapako lagegaa ki yah shahar ko sundar karne ke liye jaays he tab phir aapako mumbai main keel thonk dene par naaraaz hone kaa koi haq nahin
 But you need to think once that who is suffering from these flyovers by closing the grill
 yahaan kii sundarataa aapaki ankhon ke saamne kitni der tehregi, jab tak aap thik se dekhenge nahin, aapaki car yaa bas aage bad chuki hoga
 The intention is to make it beautiful, but what is clear is that do not sit poor under it during winter, do not hide here with scooters to avoid the rain
 saraayakale khan bas stand ke saamne jo fliover he uske neeche gril laga diya gaya he jahaan bas se utarane vaale garib dilli aakar kai baar thikaana rakhte the, baith kar apana doosraa pataa khoj lete the
 These grills have been closed before other arrangements could be made for these poor people to sit
 yahi nahin iske bheetar steel kaa bana vishalkay charkha rakhaa gaya he
 Governments are evicting the last man with the spinning wheel that Gandhi has found to reach the last man
 puri dilli ke fliover ke neeche ke hisse ko is tarah se gheraa ja rahaa he
 The pollution is so much that no one can go for a walk in the middle of the road, but in the name of decoration, this new game of displacement is like spilling into the empty spaces of the city
 zarur isaki planning karne waalon ko yah bada idia laga hoga magar aap begharon or garibon kii nazar se dekhie
 Often saying that they encroach, mess up flyovers, spoil law and order is not right
 garibon ko hataane kaa tark itnaa hi majboot lagata he aapako, itnaa hi majboot tark lagata he ki shahar ko sundar bananaa zaruri he to pehle colony ke bheetar sadak ke kinare khadi kaaron ko zabt kar lenaa chahie
 That too is an encroachment
 dilli shahar main hi sainkadon talabon kaa atikaraman ho gaya
 Could not delete any
 bahut si jagahon par atikaraman kar kya kya nahin ban gaya
 To remove them, a lawsuit goes on for decades, what is it that the poor are silently removed overnight
 ise sajaane main jo paise kharch ho rahe hai usase aam janon kii zindagi kii suvidhaayen bhi behatar ho sakati thim
 Do you know how much money is being spent in the name of beautifying these flyovers
 hamaare paas puraa data to nahin he magar 16 disambar 2017 kii times of india kii report mili
 It said that West Delhi MP Pravesh Verma inaugurated the project of beautification under Raja Garden and Mayapuri flyover
 hamaara video vahaan kaa to nahin he magar aap andaaza kar sakate hai ki is par garibon ko dur karne par saansad yaa sarkaar kitna paisa karch kar rahi he
 According to the Times of India, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has spent Rs 78 lakh in the name of beautifying Raja Garden and the underside of the Mayapuri flyover
 dilli ke rajagarden fliover ke neeche ke hisse ko bhi sundar banaaya gaya he
 In this way, a municipal corporation is constructing 12 to 14 flyovers
 yah kaaphi paisa he
 Our colleague Ravish Ranjan Shukla has found out that the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has spent a quarter to eight crores in the name of beautifying 12 flyovers
 sarkarein logon ko theke par rakh rahi hai, unhen selary nahin de paa rahi hai or fliover ko sundar banane ke liye 8 karod rupee karch kar rahi hai
 Isn't it luxury? is paise main kisi garib kii basti hi behatar kii ja sakati thi
 If we get to know how much all the municipalities are spending together in the name of making flyovers beautiful, then this budget can be quite large
 zaruri he ki ham shahar ke prati apni samaj ko zaraa thik karen
 If the law and order is not good, then recruit the police
 thik isi tarj par jantar mantar ko khatm kar diya gaya
 Demonstration sites were removed from state capitals
 visthaapan kai baar unhen bhi jhelana padataa he jo kabhi apane se garib ke hataae jane ke samarthan main tark khoj rahe hote hai
 Our colleague Saurav Shukla went to New Palam Vihar area of gurgaon
 saurav bataa rahe hai ki vahaan 24 ghante pehle notice diya gaya or 30 gharon ko raaton raat tod bhi diya gaya
 There is a discussion that the Prime Minister has to lay the foundation stone of dwarka-gurgaon Expressway in April, so these houses were shown so early in the collapse
 shahar main jagah kii bahut keemat hoti he
 Not just for the poor, but also for our children
 aaj subah subah chandigarh se ek noujvaan ne messej kiya ki vah paanch kilometre cycle chalaa kar sector 42 ke beant singh memorial librari main pratiyogita pariksha kii taiyaari karne jaataa he
 The library has increased membership fees from 150 to 300 rupees
 bahuton ko lagegaa ki maamuli vruddhi he magar ek chaatr kii nazar se dekhie to yah 300 rupaya use chubhta he
 The one-month membership fee has been reduced to 300 and the three-month membership fee to Rs 900
 isse pehle ki aap ghar baithe tark dene lagen ki kisi ko padhane se matlab nahin, librari masti karne jate hai to main kuch aapako bataanaa chahta hum
 This library, built ten years ago, is quite fine
 librari ke reeding room main 250 logon ke baithkar padhane kii vyavastha he magar jab hamane pataa kiya to bataaya gaya ki roj 450 chaatr yahaan padhane aate hai
 When you look in the pictures here, you will find that the students are studying with concentration
 kursi nahin he to zamin par baithkar pard rahe hai
 They sit in the corner of the walls and study
 beant singh memorial librari main 450 chaatr aate hai, kya yah kam badi baat he
 Earlier, the fee for three months was Rs 150, that is, the fee for one month was Rs 50, which has now been increased to Rs 300 from April 1
 50 rupee se sidhe 300 rupee prati maah
 Now, where governments also spend on the library, they think who comes to the library, so they are making a project of bluffing, such as to beautify the space under the flyover by surrounding the grill
 shahar main itani samasya he, sarkaar ko sapane main sundarataa kaa khyaal aata he
 When have you recently heard that a Chief Minister or Prime Minister has inaugurated the library? aap in tasveeron ko dekhakar ab ye na kahiega ki padhane vaale nahin hai
 If there is talk of Punjab then there is another news from there which is missing
 vahaan par shikshakon par kya guzar rahi he aap puuchhenge to desh ke kai rajyon se shikshak haath uthaakar kahenge ki haa ham par bhi vahi biit rahi he
 Do something for us
 theke kii naukari or kam selary ne logon ke sabar kaa imtahaan le liya he
 Where did you see this picture, but these people have started seeing their condition
 ye sabhi punjab sarkaar ke tahat theke par kaam karne vaale shikshak hai
 They are being told that if you take a salary of Rs 10,300 for three years, then you can be permanent
 hamaari sarkarein yaa to bheetar se khokhli ho chuki hai yaa phir naukariyon ko lekar unki niyat badal gai he
 There are 15,000 teachers under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in Punjab, at the moment their salary is 35 to 40 thousand, but they are being told that if you work for 10 thousand 300 rupees per month, then even three years the job will be confirmed
 inke pradarshan ke baad sarkaar ne 7000 shikshakon ke khilaaf cese kiya he
 Have you ever heard of a case against 7000 teachers? exiaar main 20 shikshakon ke naam hai or baaki bagaiyr naam ke darj hai
 There are 70 to 80 thousand mercury teachers in Jharkhand
 in sabhi ko 8 se 10 hazaar ke bich vetan miltaa he
 Here the teachers are working in a brick kiln
 har rajya main shikshakon kii haalat karaab he
 Bihar, UP everywhere
 hamane kuch din pehle bataaya tha ki jharkhand main survey ho rahaa he ki kis skool kaa kis skool main vilay hoga
 This is a new policy which is being seen in every government
 hazaron kii sankhya main skool kaa vilay ho rahaa he
 The government argues that the number of students is less than it should be
 is lihaaz se sarkaar apni shiksha kii zimmedaari ko janata se dur le ja rahi he
 One should think that the population is increasing and the number of students in government school is decreasing
 saamaajik kaaryakarta kehete hai ki skulon ko band karne kaa yah sab bahaanaa he
 There is a discussion in Jharkhand that 30 to 35 thousand teachers will be thrown out of this merger
 gujarat vidhansabha main bijepi ke ek vidhayak ne sawaal poocha jiskaa jawaab dilachasp he
 This news has appeared in the message of 27 March
 shiksha mantri ne sadan main jawaab diya he ki rajya ke 107 sarkari collejon main se 91 kalege main principal nahin hai, pad khaali hai
 60 percent of the posts of assistant professors are vacant
 rojgaar kii koi kami nahin he phir bhi berojgaar sadak par hai
 The Education Minister of Gujarat also informed that 14 schools, including 8 government schools in Porbandar, do not have electricity connection
 jabaki gujarat ko bijli ke maamle main sarplus rajya mana jaataa he
 No more than 6 thousand schools have boundary walls
 shahar se dharna pradarshan dur kar dene se logon kii bechaini khatm nahin ho jaati he
 They come in front of you
 tippaniyan In Lucknow, BP Eid or physical education degree holders have demonstrated in front of BJP headquarters
 teen-teen pradarshan bhaajapa mukhyalay ke saamne ho chuke hai
 These people are demanding that the state government ban the recruitments be removed and give jobs
 inkaa kahana he ki inke segment main 32 hazaar se adhik naukariyon par roak lagi hui he
 The name of the review has been stayed on 23 March 2017 while the court ordered the recruitment process to start within 28 days but has not started yet
 in naujavaanon ne apane kapade tak utaar die taaki inaki garibi bhi dikh jaae or bechaini bhi
 If you look at this flock, you will know how alert the youth has become at this time
 ye noujvaan aaj pehali baar nahin balki na jane kitni baar pradarshan kar chuke hai
 Still no one matters
 naukari kya karenge, jab paane ke liye andolan main hi inke kai saal guzar jaaenge
 Railways had removed around 90,000 recruits, adding 10,000 more to it, while the Railways has told the Parliamentary Standing Committee that there are 2 lakh 20,000 jobs, then why only one lakh, all the recruitment could have gone out
 abhi tak 90,000 bhartiyon ke liye kareeb 2 karod chaatro ne farm bharaa he
 2 crores while still 5 days are left to fill the form
 berojgaare apane aankadon ke saath saamne dastak de rahi he
 Where was the promise of providing employment to 2 crore unemployed people in a year
 ek imtahaan main 2 karod noujvaan farm bhar rahe hai
 It is better that we listen to the voice of the students ahead of time
 hazaron kii sankhya main gramin bank ke adhikari karmchaaree teen din kii hadtaal par hai, magar kahin koi sugabugahat nahin he
 By the way, these nails have now been removed, but how insensitive the intention behind planting it must have been
 shater giraane ke baad jo jagah bachi hoti he use oot kehete hai, vahaan log baith jate hai
 When tired, you get tired
 echdiefasi bank ke fort road branch ke baahar keelein lagaai gayi, jinhen ab bank ne hataa liya he
 The bank has also expressed regret
 keel pehle se thim magar nae nirmaan ke baad badi kar di gai
 These spikes are terrible, will not be removed from the minds of those who study the space for the poor in the city for a long time
 chubhti rahengi
 Will today's urban India continue to be so anti-poor, it is going on and on
 khud pevament kii zamin ko parking ke liye hathiyaa letaa he, colony ke saarvajanik raaston par lohe kaa get laga detaa he magar ham is had tak pahunchenge ki baithne kii jagah par keel laga denge taaki is tarah koi thakaa mada thodi si jagah paakar baith na jaae
 Not only India, all the major cities of the world remain homeless
 mausam kii maar jhelte hue kisi park main, kisi ped ke neeche, kisi fliover ke neeche apane thikaane bana lete hai
 Many people see them as filth, as encroachment, as a law and order problem
 aap kya karenge, america kaa ek shahar he california, yah shahar tex ke kaaran bahut mahangaa ho gaya he
 So expensive that households become homeless
 car main raat guzaarte hai or apana makaan bechakar duusare shahar kii taraf bhaag rahe hai
 Between July 2016 and July 2017, 1 lakh 38 thousand people left the city of California
 isliye beghar ko dekhakar naak bhun sicodne kii zarurat nahin he, jinke ghar hai ve bhi beghar ho sakate hai
 But how does the society there see its homeless? sietal paciphical uniwarsity ne begharon se kaha ki aap sardi ke 90 dinon ke liye hamaare campus main aakar rahen, vahaan apana camp laga len
 After that Washington University has done the same
 kya aapane bharat main kisi uniwarsity ko aisa karte dekha he ki sardi ke dinon main begharon ke liye apana campus khol de
 Seattle Pacific University gave 65 homeless people a place to camp in their parking lots
 ham hai ki keel laga rahe hai
 It is better that we imagine a city that is liberal about the homeless
 unka khyaal rakhata he
 That is why in the winter, the government makes a night shelter, then everyone likes it
 ab aapane mumbai main echdiefasi shakha ke baahar keelein dekhi lekin kya yah dilli main nahin ho rahaa he
 It is happening in Delhi but from the other side
 aapane gaur kiya hoga ki dilli ke saare fliover ke neeche kaa hissaa gril lagaakar band kiya ja rahaa he
 You will feel that it is justified to beautify the city, then you have no right to be angry at the spike in Mumbai
 par aapako ek baar sochna chahie ki in fliowaron ko gril se band karne se kiskaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 The beauty here will be how long before your eyes, until you see properly, your car or bus will have moved forward
 iraadaa to sundar banane kaa he, magar jo saaf dikhaai detaa he vah yah ki iske neeche sardi ke dinon main garib na baithen, barish se bachane ke liye scooter vaale yahaan na chhipen
 The grill has been installed under the flyover in front of the Seraikale Khan bus stand where the poor people who landed on the bus used to come to Delhi many times, sit and find their second address
 in garibon ke baithne kaa doosraa intazaam ho isse pehle ye gril band kar die gaye hai
 Not only this, a huge spinning wheel made of steel is placed inside it
 gandhi ne jis charakhe ko antim aadmi tak pahunchane ke liye dhundha, sarkarein us charakhe ke sahare antim aadmi ko bedakhal kar rahi hai
 The entire portion of Delhi's flyover is being cordoned off in this way
 pradooshan itnaa he ki sadak ke bich main koi tahalne bhi nahin ja saktaa he magar sajaavat ke naam par visthaapan kaa yah nayaa khel shahar kii khaali jagahon main keel thonkane jaisaa hi he
 Those planning it must have thought of this big idea, but look at it from the point of view of the homeless and the poor
 aksar yah kahana ki ye atikaraman karte hai, fliover ko ganda karte hai, kanoon vyavastha ko kharaab karte hai sahi nahin he
 The logic of removing the poor seems to be so strong
 You think, the logic is that it is necessary to make the city beautiful, then the cars parked on the side of the road within the colony should be seized first
 wo bhi to atikaraman he
 Hundreds of ponds were encroached in the city of Delhi itself
 koi hataa nahin sakaa
 What did not become by encroaching in many places
 unhen hataane ke liye to dashakon mukadmaa chalata he, aisa kya he ki garib ko raaton raat chup chaap ek baar main hi hataa diya jaataa he
 With the money being spent in decorating it, the facilities of life of common people could have been improved
 kya aap jaanate hai ki in fliowaron ko sundar banane ke naam par kitna paisa karch kiya ja rahaa he
 We do not have complete data but the Times of India report dated 16 December 2017 was found
 isamen kaha gaya he ki pashchim dilli ke saansad pravesh verma ne raja garden or mayapuri fliover ke neeche saundaryikaran ke project kaa udghaatan kiya
 Our video is not there but you can guess how much money the MP or government is spending on removing the poor
 times of india ke anusaar dakshin dilli municipal corporation ne raja garden or mayapuri fliover ke neeche ke hisse ko sundar banane ke naam par 78 lakh rupee karch kiye hai
 The underside of Delhi's Rajgarden flyover has also been beautified
 is tarah se ek nagar nigam 12 se 14 fliover bana rahaa he
 This is a lot of money
 hamaare sahyogi raveesh ranjan shukla ne pataa kiya he ki dakshin dilli nagar nigam ne 12 fliover ko sundar banane ke naam par paune aath karod rupee kharch kiye hai
 Governments are hiring people, are not able to pay them salaries, and are spending 8 crores to make flyovers beautiful
 kya ye vilasita nahin he
 In this money only a poor colony could be improved
 agar hamen yah pataa chale ki sari nagarpalikaayen milakar fliover ko sundar banane ke naam par kitna karch kar rahi hai to yah bajet kaaphi bada ho saktaa he
 It is important that we correct our understanding of the city
 kanoon vyavastha thik nahin he to police kii bhartee karen
 Jantar Mantar was destroyed on the same lines
 rajyon kii rajdhaniyon se dharne pradarshan kii jagahon ko dur kar diya gaya
 Displacement is often faced by those who are sometimes seeking arguments in support of the removal of the poor from themselves
 hamaare sahyogi saurav shukla gudgaanv ke new palam vihaar ilaake main gaye
 Saurav is saying that notice was given 24 hours ago and 30 houses were also destroyed overnight
 vahaan charchaa he ki pradhanmantri ko april main dwarka-gudgaanv express ve kaa shilanyas karnaa he isliye in gharon ko dhahaane main itani jaldi dikhaai gai
 The place costs a lot in the city
 sirf garib ke liye nahin, hamaare aapke bacchon ke liye bhi
 This morning, a young man from Chandigarh messaged that he cycled five kilometers to go to the Beant Singh Memorial Library of Sector 42 to prepare for the competition examination
 librari ne sadsyta kii fees 150 se badha kar 300 rupee kar di he
 Many will feel that there is a slight increase but from the point of view of a student, this Rs 300 pricks him
 ek maheene kaa sadsyta shulk 300 or teen maheene kaa sadsyta shulk 900 rupee kar diya gaya he
 Before you start arguing that sitting at home does not make any sense, i want to tell you something about going to the library for fun
 das saal pehle bani yah librari kaaphi thik thaak he
 There is a system of sitting for 250 people in the reading room of the library, but when we found out, we were told that 450 students come here every day
 jab aap yahaan kii tasveeron main dekhenge to paaenge ki chaatr kitni ekaagratha se pard rahe hai
 If there is no chair, then sitting on the ground and studying
 deevaaron ke kone main baithkar padhate hai
 Beant Singh Memorial Library has 450 students, is it a big deal? pehle yahaan teen maheene kii fees 150 rupee thi, yani ek maheene kii fees hui 50 rupee jise ab ek april se badha kar 300 rupee kar diya gaya he
 Rs 50 to Rs 300 per month directly
 ab sarkarein bhi librari par kahaan kharch karti hai, unhen lagata he ki librari main koun aata he, isliye ve jhansa dene kaa project bana rahi hai, jaise fliover ke neeche kii jagah ko gril se gher kar sundar banaao
 There is so much problem in the city, the government dreams of beauty
 haal philhal main aapane kab suna he ki kisi mukhyamantri yaa pradhanmantri ne librari kaa udghaatan kiya ho
 Looking at these pictures, you will not say now that you are not going to read
 punjab kii baat chali he to vahaan se ek or khabar he jiskaa zikr gaayab he
 If you ask what is going on the teachers there, the teachers from many states of the country will raise their hands and say that yes we are also having the same
 hamaara bhi kuch kiijie
 Contract jobs and low salary have taken the test of patience for the people
 ye tasviir aapako kahaan dikhi magar in logon ko apni haalat dikhne lagi he
 All of them are contractual teachers under the Punjab government
 inase kaha ja rahaa he ki agar aap teen saal tak 10,300 rupee vetan lenge to uske baad aapako permanent kiya ja saktaa he
 Our governments have either become hollow from within or their intentions about jobs have changed
 punjab main sarv shiksha abhiyaan ke tahat 15,000 shikshak hai, is vakt inaki selary 35 se 40 hazaar he magar inase kaha ja rahaa he ki aap 10 hazaar 300 rupee prati maah par kaam kar len wo bhi teen saal to naukari pakki ho jaaegi
 After their performance, the government has filed a case against 7000 teachers

 The FIR has the names of 20 teachers and the remaining are unnamed

 The condition of teachers is bad in every state

 We had told a few days ago that a survey is being done in Jharkhand about which school will be merged with which school
 yah ek nai niti he jo har sarkaar main dekhi ja rahi he
 Thousands of schools are merging
 sarkaar tark detii he ki jitne chaatr hone chahie utane se kam hai
 In this context, the government is taking away the responsibility of its education from the public
 sochna chahie ki aabaadi bad rahi he or sarkari skool me chaatro kii sankhya kam ho rahi he
 Social workers say this is all an excuse to close schools
 jharkhand main charchaa he ki is vilay se 30 se 35 hazaar shikshak naukari se baahar ho jaaenge
 a BJP MLA in Gujarat Legislative Assembly asked the question, the answer is interesting

 They say that more than 32 thousand jobs have been banned in their segment
 23 march 2017 ko samiksha ke naam par roak lagaai gai he jabaki court ne 28 dinon ke bheetar bhartee prakriya shuru karne kaa aadesh diya tha magar abhi tak shuru nahin hui he
 These youngsters even took off their clothes so that their poverty is seen and restlessness is seen

 So far, around 2 crore students have filled the form for 90,000 recruitments

 Unemployment is coming to the fore with its figures

 Thousands of officials of Grameen Bank are on strike for three days, but there is no murmur

 So there is no need to shrink the nose eyebrow by looking at the homeless, those who have houses can also become homeless
 par vahaan kaa samaaj kis tarah se apane begharon ko dekhtaa he
 Seattle Pacific University told the homeless that you should stay on our campus for 90 days of winter, set up your camp there
 uske baad washington uniwarsity ne bhi aisa kiya he
 Have you seen any university in India do this so that it opens its campus for the homeless in winter
 sietal pacific uniwarsity ne apane parking main 65 begharon ko camp lagane ke liye jagah de di thi
 We are putting that nail on

 yahaan kii sundarataa aapaki ankhon ke saamne kitni der tehregi, jab tak aap thik se dekhenge nahin, aapaki car yaa bas aage bad chuki hoga
 The intention is to make it beautiful, but what is clear is that do not sit poor under it during winter, do not hide here with scooters to avoid the rain

 These grills have been closed before other arrangements could be made for these poor people to sit

 The pollution is so much that no one can go for a walk in the middle of the road, but in the name of decoration, this new game of displacement is like spilling into the empty spaces of the city

 According to the Times of India, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has spent Rs 78 lakh in the name of beautifying Raja Garden and the underside of the Mayapuri flyover
 dilli ke rajagarden fliover ke neeche ke hisse ko bhi sundar banaaya gaya he
 In this way, a municipal corporation is constructing 12 to 14 flyovers

 Earlier, the fee for three months was Rs 150, that is, the fee for one month was Rs 50, which has now been increased to Rs 300 from April 1
 50 rupee se sidhe 300 rupee prati maah
 Now, where governments also spend on the library, they think who comes to the library, so they are making a project of bluffing, such as to beautify the space under the flyover by surrounding the grill

 The logic of removing the poor seems to be so strong
 You think, the logic is that it is necessary to make the city beautiful, then the cars parked on the side of the road within the colony should be seized first
 wo bhi to atikaraman he
 Hundreds of ponds were encroached in the city of Delhi itself
 koi hataa nahin sakaa
 What did not become by encroaching in many places
 unhen hataane ke liye to dashakon mukadmaa chalata he, aisa kya he ki garib ko raaton raat chup chaap ek baar main hi hataa diya jaataa he
 With the money being spent in decorating it, the facilities of life of common people could have been improved
 kya aap jaanate hai ki in fliowaron ko sundar banane ke naam par kitna paisa karch kiya ja rahaa he
 We do not have complete data but the Times of India report dated 16 December 2017 was found
 isamen kaha gaya he ki pashchim dilli ke saansad pravesh verma ne raja garden or mayapuri fliover ke neeche saundaryikaran ke project kaa udghaatan kiya
 Our video is not there but you can guess how much money the MP or government is spending on removing the poor
 times of india ke anusaar dakshin dilli municipal corporation ne raja garden or mayapuri fliover ke neeche ke hisse ko sundar banane ke naam par 78 lakh rupee karch kiye hai
 The underside of Delhi's Rajgarden flyover has also been beautified
 is tarah se ek nagar nigam 12 se 14 fliover bana rahaa he

 gujarat ke shiksha mantri ne yah bhi bataaya ki porbandar ke 8 sarkari skulon sahit 14 skulon main bijli kaa conection nahin hai
 Whereas Gujarat is considered a surplus state in terms of electricity
 6 hazaar se adhik skulon main chaharadivari nahin he
 The restlessness of the people does not end by taking away the protest demonstration from the city
 wo aapke saamne aa hi jate hai
 The comments lakhanu main beepi id yani physical ajukeshan kii degree dharakon ne bhaajapa mukhyalay ke saamne pradarshan kiya he
 Three demonstrations have been held in front of the BJP headquarters
 ye log maang kar rahe hai ki rajya sarkaar ne bhartiyon par jo roak lagaai he wo hataae or naukari de
 They say that more than 32 thousand jobs have been banned in their segment
 23 march 2017 ko samiksha ke naam par roak lagaai gai he jabaki court ne 28 dinon ke bheetar bhartee prakriya shuru karne kaa aadesh diya tha magar abhi tak shuru nahin hui he
 These youngsters even took off their clothes so that their poverty is seen and restlessness is seen

 These youngsters have not performed for the first time today but do not know how many times they have performed

 The library has increased membership fees from 150 to 300 rupees
 bahuton ko lagegaa ki maamuli vruddhi he magar ek chaatr kii nazar se dekhie to yah 300 rupaya use chubhta he
 The one-month membership fee has been reduced to 300 and the three-month membership fee to Rs 900

 When you look in the pictures here, you will find that the students are studying with concentration
 kursi nahin he to zamin par baithkar pard rahe hai
 They sit in the corner of the walls and study

 Earlier, the fee for three months was Rs 150, that is, the fee for one month was Rs 50, which has now been increased to Rs 300 from April 1
 50 rupee se sidhe 300 rupee prati maah
 Now, where governments also spend on the library, they think who comes to the library, so they are making a project of bluffing, such as to beautify the space under the flyover by surrounding the grill
 shahar main itani samasya he, sarkaar ko sapane main sundarataa kaa khyaal aata he
 When have you recently heard that a Chief Minister or Prime Minister has inaugurated the library? aap in tasveeron ko dekhakar ab ye na kahiega ki padhane vaale nahin hai

 The Bombay High Court has approved the release of Anurag Kashyap's film 'udta Punjab', sparked by controversy after differences with the censor board
 court ne apane faisle main do took shabdon main kaha ki film main desh yaa rajya ke khilaaf kuch bhi nahin he or na hi yah film drugs kaa mahimamandan karti he
 The Bombay High Court also reprimanded the Central Board of Film Certification (censor Board)

 Not only against the film country or state, the court also issued important instructions on Monday
 court ne kaha ki film kii script or naam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he ki desh kii ekta yaa samprabhutaa ko chot pahunche
 Abuse in every dialogue is not necessary, Bombay High Court said during the hearing, 'as far as cut number 5 is concerned, some abuses have been used
 kuch kharaab shabdon ko hataae jane kii jarurat he
 We do not agree that the use of abuses in some films should be allowed, so they should be allowed in Udta Punjab also

 On cut number 6, the court said, 'MP, MLA, Parliament are common words
 ye kisi sanghathan ke bare main nahin hai, lekin yah saamaanya raajnneetik chizon ko dikhalaate hai

 The court has also said that no one can tell what kind of film the filmmaker should make

 The ease with which the drug is available and the people deployed to stop it is not able to do its job properly is a matter of concern
 film ke sabhi kirdaar is samasya ko bakhubi pesh karte hai
 'removing the scene, not banning film making', the court said, "the purpose of the board is not to ban film making, the aim is to take decisions keeping society in mind
 board ko yah aashwast karnaa hoga ki drug ko glamer main tabdeel karne vaale drishy na dikhaae jaaen
 Sensitive issues should not have been instigated and dual meaning things should not be promoted

 The year 2017 has not been very special for Bollywood in terms of films
 saal ke lagbhag saat maheene ho chuke hai, lekin 'bahubali 2' ko chhodkar kisi film ne banpar kamai nahin kii he
 People and distributors had high expectations from Salman Khan's 'tubelight' and Shah Rukh Khan's Raees, but both films were average
 july maheene main shridevi kii ection packed film 'mom' ke trailor ko dekhakar laga ki shaayad yah film hit filmon kaa sookhaa khatm kare
 'mom' may have liked the audience, but in the case of the collection was defeated
 ab kal yani 21 july ko do filmein- 'munna maaikel' or 'lipstick under maay burka' relies hogi
 If we talk about 'munna Michael' then it is being speculated that the film's opening is going to be very good
 munna maaikel kaa doosraa gaanaa ding dong relies, dikhaa tiger kaa behtareen danceector tiger shroff or diarector shabbir khan kii jodi teesri baar saath aa rahi he
 Earlier, both of them have appeared in Tiger's debut films 'heropanti' and 'baghi'
 'munna maaikel' main tiger or navazuddin siddiki kaa ection or dance logon ko pasand aane kii ummid he
 Distributors say that the film will do well on single screens
 distributor akshay rathi ne ek film best website ko bataaya ki tiger or navaj kii camestry bahut kreji he
 Both will give very good performance
 shabbir khan kii filmon ko log bahut enjoy karte hai
 The music of the film is also liked by the audience
 yah weekend bahut romaanchak hoga
 The first song of Tiger's film 'munna Michael' did the fans crazy that the film will be released in 1400 screens
 film pehle din 6-8 karod rupee or pehle weekend 18-25 karod rupee kaa collection kar sakati he
 If Munna Michael does a business of Rs 6-8 crores on the first day, then it can be a matter of thinking for Ranbir Kapoor too
 darasal ranbir kaa filmi kariyar kuch samay se khaas nahin chal rahaa he
 The film Jagga Jasoos, released the same month, earned only Rs 8 crore on the first day
 'munna maaikel' kaa luk dekh aapako yaad aayega 'diljala' jaiki shropub ranbir jaise sthapit kalakaaron ke filmon ke pehle din kii kamai, tiger jaise nae sitaron ke collection se maat kha jaati he, to yah ranbir ke liye buree khabar he

 police giraft main aae teenon aropiyon main ek gaurav lala saini ke saath elbum main kaam bhi kar chukaa he
 The accused are being questioned by the police

 aropiyon ke kabje se teen pistaul, chaar jinda kaartoos or mritak singer lala saini kii car baraamad kar lee he
 Lala Saini's Keshavco has been sent to the hospital for postmortem
 report aane ke baad aage kii karrwai kii jaaegi
 That day Mohit's father then beat him badly
 vaise to pita sharaab pine ke baad nau saal ke bete ko roj hi peethta tha, lekin us din kii maar uske liye nirnaayak sabit hui
 a boy from the neighborhood said, "mohit, my father also kills me a lot and you also beat me every day
" chalo yahaan se nikal lete hai
 After that no one saw Mohit of Vijayanagar area of ghaziabad city
 udhar, gajiabad ke loni main aath saal ke aashu ko uske pita ne choumin kaa kuch saamaan lene bheja
 After purchasing the goods, Ashu has Rs
 70
 bachane chahie the, lekin jab vah pita ke choumin ke thele par pahunchaa to uski anti main sirf 65 ru
 Were
 paanch rupye gaayab
 The father roared - "five rupees
" dhundhakar laa, nahin to teri chamadi udhed duungaa
 The child looked for a coin of five throughout the day, but neither that coin was to be found, nor found
 jaanwaron jaisi pitayee ke khauf se aashu kaa dil baith gaya
 Nobody saw him again in Loni
 loni kii hi panchvati colony main 15 saal kii shivani or uskaa 10 saal kaa bhai sahil apane pita sanjeev ke saath rahete the
 Just five km from Delhi, this settlement of daily wage laborers looks like a businessman
 yahaan na to bijli kaa kanoonee conection he or na pine kaa pani
 The financial condition of the family is so bad that it is better not to teach the children
 aise main shivani ko hameshaa apni us maa kii yaad aati rahati jo aath saal pehle use chhod kar chali gai thi
 After the mother left, the children became orphans, because the father had no time to worry about them
 shivani ko lagata tha ki maa mumbai gai he
 One day these two children came out to find the mother, that they could not be seen again
 ye or aisi saikadon gumshudagiyaan gajiabad ke alag-alag thanon ke rojnaamachon main darj hoti raheen, jaisi ki desh ke baaki hisson main hoti rahati hai
 Actually, this was a small sample of a large story of about one lakh children (see map) disappearing every year in the country
 desh ke zyaadaatar rajyon main kuch din bacchon ko khojane ke baad ghar vaale paanv patakekar rah jate hai or police is gaiyr aapraadhik vaardaat par dhyaan dene kii jahamat nahin uthaati
 In most cases firs are not even registered
 ye alag baat he ki uttar bharat main uttar pradesh or dilli bacchon kii gumshudi kaa sabase bada centre hai
 Operation Smilelekin began but one day things suddenly started changing
 is badlaav se na sirf gajiabad ke khoe bachche milane lage balki uttar pradesh ke kai jilon or desh ke baaki hisson ke bachche bhi baraamad hone lage
 Dharmendra Singh, a Wildlife photographer by heart and Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of Ghaziabad, recounts the birth of Operation Smile
 "on September 14, the police team raided a place in Ghaziabad and rescued 51 bonded child laborers
 ” ek saath itane bacchon kii rihaai ke baad dharmendra ke dimag main yah baat ai ki agar ek karrwai main duusare rajyon ke itane bachche chhudaae ja sakate hai to gajiabad ke gaayab bacchon kii sud kyon na lee jaae? unhone gajiabad ke tejatarraar police kshetradhikari (sio) ranvijay singh ko bulaayaa or gumshuda bacchon kii baramadagi kaa khaakaa taiyaar karne ko kaha
 Within two days, the police captain had a list of 127 such children whose deaths were on the mercy of termites in different police stations of Ghaziabad for years
 list to saamne thi, lekin bachche kahaan honge or iske liye itane bade desh main kahaan chhapemari kii jaae? iskaa hal niklaa un puraane record se, jisase pataa chalaa ki gajiabad se gaayab hue zyaadaatar bachche isse pehle puraani dilli railway stesan, har kii paudi, haridwar, dehradun, gudgaanv, chandigarh or faridabad se baraamad hue hai
 Apart from this, the cities where children of Ghaziabad met were Jaipur, Mumbai and Kolkata
 duusari baat yah pataa chali ki zyaadaatar maamalon main agar bachche sex racket kaa shikaar nahin hai to ve railway stesan, bas addon, bade chauraahon, fliover ke neeche, bade mandir yaa dargah yaa phir bahut se maamalon main enjio or shelter house main milte hai
 That is, they are orphans not being near any organized kidnapping gang, because there is no serious attempt to find them
 isliye gajiabad police ne apane oparation main aadhunik takanic, mobile phone, whatsap, fasebuk or jarurat padane par video chating kaa khub upyog kiya
 Pramod Kumar, Sub Inspector of Indirapuram police station, remembers the exact address of a child's village in Bharuch district of Gujarat from a friend of his Facebook and found out in the police station whether a missing child was reported is? To save time and money, he also sent photos to the family of the child on whatsapp
 (oparation smil main aadhunik takanic ke istemaal ke liye dekhen chitrankan
 ) With the new thinking, 38 teams of Ghaziabad Police, which came out to find 127 children, had 227 recovered children after a month
 ranvijay bataate hai, ''mujhe yaad he, captain sahab ne sab police waalon se kaha ki ek baar socho, tumhaara apana baccha kho gaya he
 How much pain you would have had if this happened
 dhyaan rakhana, tum duty par nahin, haj par ja rahe ho
 80 of the recovered children were from Ghaziabad and the remaining 147 were from other districts and states
 oparation kii kamyaabi dekhte hue 8 aktubar ko uttar pradesh ke police mahanideshak anandlaal banerjee ne uttar pradesh ke sabhi jilon main oparation smil shuru karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 However, the returning children include Mohit, Ashu, Shivani and Sahil, who initially fled the house
 (loni main apane chote bhai ke saath lakhanu main ek enjio se mila aashu)gumshudagi ke dauraan kya gujarius din pita kii pitayee se bhaaga mohit aaj maa ke anchal kii chhaanv main baitha he
 Mother is admiring him
 darasal vah to bete ke jane ke baad pagal-si ho gai thi
 Now his condition is better
 dabdbai ankhon se mohit apni kahani sunaata he, ''main or meraa dost train se jaipur pahunch gaye
 Two days later the friend returned, but i did not return
 phir mujhe ek antee apane saath le gayi
 He started the work of getting empty bottles at me
 ” 5 aktubar, 2014 ko sab inspector manikchandra verma ke milane se pehle tak vah teen saal tak yahi kaam karata rahaa
 The woman also changed her name to Javed
 verma bataate hai, ''jab is bachche ko maine stesan se chhudaane kii koshish kii to mahila ne hangaamaa khadaa kar diya
 i was in civil dress and the situation got worse when the child started calling the woman his aunt
 ” jaise-taise sthaneey police ke hastkshep or phone par parivaar waalon se baat karaane par maamla sanbhala
 Sudhir Jain, a criminologist and director of the Innovative India Foundation (IIF), understands this reaction of the child as, "that woman must have tortured the child, but will also love according to human nature
" aise main teen saal tak saath rahane ke baad bhavuk rishta bananaa swaabhaavik he
 This is what happened in this case
 ”lekin bhavukta donon taraf hoti he
 Khoda's Durgesh went missing four years ago when she was just four years old
 use 12 aktubar ko dilli ke piragadhi ilaake ke ek shelter house asharan overa main paaya gaya
 The interesting thing is that the girl was recovered when her preparations for adopting another family were completed
 head consteble ashraf ali ke mobile main maa-beti ke milan kaa video kuch aisa dikhaa—ek mahila dur se angan main khadey kai bacchon ko dekh rahi he
 Then she set her eyes on a baby girl and she burst into tears
 maa-beti ek-duusare kii taraf daudin
 The two kept crying to each other until the sound of laughing from behind disturbed their rhythm
 yah hansi ashram kii sanchalikaon kii thi, jo maa-beti ke milan se bahut khush thim
 Many such videos of lost children visiting their families are being captured by the Ghaziabad policemen in their mobile phones
 aashu bhi isi tarah lakhanu ke ek shelter home se chaar saal baad mila
 Ashu got an opportunity to study there
 aaj vah apane baaki chaar bhaaiyon se alag lagata he
 Its colloquial is like that of the children of the convent
 or yah bataanaa nahin bhuulataa ki ghar par use kam acha lag rahaa he
 And Shivani and Sahil went to Mumbai to find their mother
 vahaan ke ek shelter house ko jab is oparation kaa pataa chalaa to unhone gajiabad police ko phone kiya or bachche waapas aae
 But after living in Mumbai for three months, Shivani's speech has come to Bombay touch
 behad garib parivaar kii ladki ke vaakyon ke bich main 'you no’, 'aai min’, 'ekchuali’ jaise shabd ek khaas najaakat ke saath utarate hai
 However, his father Sanjeev says, "children do not have the capacity to enroll in school
" ”punarmilan kiin sachhee kahaniyon ke bich sawaal yah he ki jab baraamad bacchon main se 30 fisadi bachche enjio ke paas the to ve pariwaron tak kyon nahin pahunch paae? is sawaal par bachapan bachaao andolan ke rakesh senger kehete hai, ''jarurat is baat kii he ki iske liye ek rashtravyapee special cell banaai jaae
 Police of all states should work together
 ”(mumbai main maa ko khojane ke chakkar main gum hue sahil or shivani ghar laut aae)drugs kaa jaalgaziabad police ko 70 bachche to sirf puraani dilli railway stesan or puraani dilli ke hanuman mandir ke paas se mili
 Most of them are drug addicts
 inamen se 10 bachche aise hai jinke pariwaron ko police ne khoj liya he, lekin maa-baap bacchon ko lene ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 They say they cannot raise these intoxicated children
 gajiabad ke laal bahadur shastri sudarshan bal grih main kabir, asalam or rajnish jaise kai tej dimag bachche isi lat kaa shikaar hai
 When a 12-year-old Rajneesh sings, it seems that a professional singer is singing
 rajnish ankhen ponchhate hue esaspi dharmendra singh se kahata he, ''main ghar nahin jaaoongaa, mujhe gayak bananaa he
 Beats at home
 ” dharmendra singh ne bhi usase kisi sangeet skool main daakhil karaane kaa vaada kiya he
 He says, "I will teach it at my expense
 ” lekin baaki bacchon kaa bhavishya khatre main he
 The eight-year-old Kabir laughingly tells, "I smoke bidis, i also smoke cigarettes
 sab nasha karata hum
 i will drink a bottle of beer comfortably
 ” kabir puraani dilli railway stesan par jebkatra giroh main tha
 Neither the family nor the family is accepting these children
 aise main ve kahin gunaah ke daldal main na chal jaaen
 When will Smile-2 Dinanath Chauhan, field researcher in Delhi Child Rights Protection Commission, leads to another aspect of the problem
 ve kehete hai, ''oparation smil saraahneey he lekin isamen ve bachche nahin chhue gaye hai jo sangathit aparaadh kii chapet main he
 Hundreds of children have been held hostage in villages in Haryana, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh for bonded labor in sugarcane fields and homes
 ” iske alaava sex racket ke liye ladakiyon ko agava karne ke maamle alag hai
 But the difference in the profile of the children engaged by the Ghaziabad police is also because the children of Ghaziabad will not be abducted for wages in the surrounding areas, doing so is a high risk job
 duusari taraf baaki rajyon se gaayab hone vaale bacchon main ladakiyon kaa anupaat zyada hota he, vahiin uttar pradesh se ladakiyon kii tulana main dedh gunna ladke agava hote hai
 That is, the character of Uttar Pradesh is different from the national character
 samasya ke rashtriya swaroop ko dekhte hue supreme court ne bihar or jharkhand kii sarkaron ko is maamle main teji se karrwai karne ke nirdesh die hai
 Bihar has been asked to recover all the missing children in three weeks
 supreme court pehle bhi daant chukaa he, ''agar dijipi ke bachche laapata hote tab bhi aapkaa kya yahi ravaiya hota?”inhen prayaason main ek aayam or jodate hue bacchon kii counselling ke liye manovaigyanikon ko online uplabdh karaane vaali desh kii pehali site adwiceddï dot com ke editor vivek satyamitram kehete hai, ''bacchon kii maansik samasyaayein bahut jatil hoti hai
 We can get children out of the mindset of running home through online counseling
 ” supreme court ke sakht rukh or bal adhikaar kaaryakarta kailash satyaarthee ko mili nobel puraskaar ne is mudde ko surkhiyon main laa diya he, aise main oparation smil puure desh main kaam kaa ho saktaa he
 Operation Smilegaziabad Police achieved great success by adopting complete scientific method instead of shouting slogans

 We will not allow the Coordination Committee to trick lawyers

 BCI chairman Mishra said the lawyers' meeting with the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi failed because the chairman of the Coordination Committee did not allow the matter to be resolved due to his political ambitions

 There have been 182 assembly elections in Gujarat and the results have come
 patidaaron ke garh main bijepi ne siten bachaa lee hai
 Initially lagging behind, the BJP later overtook the Congress
 shuru main rujhaan aise the ki dipti siem or bijepi ke kaddavar netaa nitin patel bhi peeche najar aa rahe the
 He took the lead much later
 mehsana jile kii sabhi siten patidaaron kaa garh hai
 Hardik has a strong hold here
 gujarat main 83 siton par patidaaron kaa asarbatate chalem ki gujarat main 83 aisi siten hai jahaan patidaaron kaa sidhaa asar he
 In the last election, BJP had captured 59 seats here
 jabaki 22 siton par congress ummidavaaron ko jeet mili thi
 2 seats were occupied by others
 bijepi ne cabinet main 44 ummidavaaron ko jagah di thi
 Till now, Mehsana, a BJP stronghold, in 1984, BJP had got only two seats in the entire country
 us dauraan bhi ek seat mehsana kii thi
 This area is considered a BJP stronghold
 lekin patidaar andolan or hardik patel kii maujuudagi kii vajah se is baar bijepi kaa kila hilta najar aa rahaa he
 Rahul's 21 days in the election: BJP has put a lot of effort to win Gujarat for the sixth time in the focus of the first phase, the strength of Jhonka in Saurashtra
 haalanki patidaaron kii naaraazgi kii vajah se is baar rajya main bijepi kii satta main vaapasi kaaphi mushkil bataaya ja rahaa he
 Patidars led a big movement in Gujarat under the leadership of Hardik Patel on the reservation issue
 patidaaron kii kathith naaraazgi or hardik kaa congress ke paksh main prachaar is baar bijepi ke liye mushkilen khadi karata dikh rahaa he
 In the results it will be interesting to see how much BJP has suffered due to Hardik Patel's presence in the election this time
 gujarat chunaav 2017: counting se pehle roopaani kaa daawa, 150 siten jeetengegujarat main patidaar kitna ahm hai iskaa andaja is baat se bhi laga sakate hai ki bijepi sarkaar main 44 patidaar vidhayakon ko cabinet main jagah di gai thi
 In this assembly election, BJP has given tickets to most Patidar leaders in Patidar dominated seats
 vidhansabha ke liye do phej main vot daale gaye the
 But this time there has been a decline in voting in Patidar dominated seats

 It is a step towards showing young stars in a very different way
 lekin dhai ghante lambii film kahani or diarection ke maamle main jarur uljhan main daal detii he
 The kind of charisma that was expected from the film does not live up to 100 percent

 Time is out

 They are forced into illegal business under compulsion

 Many kinds of truth are revealed, and the director feels that he will make you stand on the seat

 He needs to work hard on his presence right now
 unhone lagaataar teesri film engri yang main ke taur par di he
 They raise hope but there is still a long way to go
 priyanka apane taraashe hue badan or maadak adaaon se film main kaaphi koshish karti najar aati hai
 But it cannot be called his film
 irfan khan jitna samay rahete hai, thik hai
 The film's earnings can be called USP of the film
 gane behtareen hai
 a trio of three does not make fun
 film vailemtine de ke maukey par relies hui he, lekin vailemtine de kaa cinema to katai nahin he
 Of course viewers hoping for a friendship like Sholay may be disappointed
 lekin ise ali kii acchhee koshish kah sakate hai
 The rest of the public knows Janardan and if the hearts of the youth are touched, the fate of the film can change

 @7:53 - shuruaati rujhaan thodi der main Angry over the ban on exports of milk, cotton and sugar, Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar has written a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh about this and expressed his opposition
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kii nitiyaan kisaanon ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahi hai or unhen udyog ke liye ‘sabsidi’ deni pad rahi he
 The Agriculture Minister wrote a letter to the Prime Minister the previous day
 isse ek din pehle hi mantriyon ke samooh ne chaalu vipanan varsh main 1
 It had refused to allow cotton exports of more than 3 crore bales
 pavaar ne vishesh rup se ke ve thomas kii aguwai vaale khaadya mantralay or anand sharma kii aguwai vaale kapadaa mantralay ko aade haath lete hue kaha he ki unki nitiyaan kisaanon ke khilaaf hai
 Describing the 'ban' on cotton exports as a regressive step, the Agriculture Minister said that the Indian cotton cultivator cannot be asked to bear the subsidy burden for textile mills
 unhone kaha ki kapadaa udyogpatiyon ke laabh ke liye chote kapaas kisaanon ke hiton ke saath samjhauta uchit nahin he
 Pawar said that similarly the food ministry's negative stance on sugar exports has caused a huge loss of export earnings
 is aamadani kaa istemaal ganna kisaanon ke bakaaye ke bhugtan ke liye kiya ja saktaa tha, jo 8,000 karod rupee se adhik ho gaya he
 Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar said that despite instructions to abolish the quota system for exports among the mills of the empowered group of ministers, the Food Ministry has not come up with a new way to increase sugar exports
 unhone kaha ki hamen 2006-07 or 2007-08 kii galatiyon se sabak siikhnaa chahie, jab hamen chini udyog or ganna kisaanon ko raahat ke liye niryaat or bafer sabsidi par 1,500 karod rupee kharch karne pade the
 In view of higher domestic production, the government has allowed export of 3 million tonnes of sugar in three installments for this year
 khaadya mantralay ne teesri kist ke niryaat faisle ko abhi tak adhishuchet nahin kiya he
 Pawar said that the Center's policy on milk and milk products is similar
 unhone schimd mild powder or kaisen ke niryaat ko jald kholane kii maang kii
 Pawar has said in his letter that there has been a record production of food grains, cotton, sugarcane and oilseeds in the country
 yah uplabdhi badhati utpaadan laagat ke baavjood hasil hui he
 It is not possible to extract all the costs from the minimum support price of the government and in such a situation we need a free market and trade system, so that farmers can get remunerative prices

 soochna kaa adhikaar (right to information) bhartiya loktantr ke itihaas main nagarikon ko shashakt banane ke liye saunpa gaya sabase bada adhikaar mana jaataa he
 It aims to promote transparency and accountability in the functioning of the government
 2005 main manmohan singh sarkaar ne jammu or kashmir ko chhod kar RTI act ko puure desh main lagu kiya to manshaa yahi thi ki hamaara loktantr sahi myne main logon ke liye kaam kare
 But did it really happen? What is the reality of RTI law at present? How much transparency is there in the functioning of government? The law which was to become the most powerful voice of the public, is not that voice being suppressed? In the last three months, as the head of RTI Cell and Research Department of India Today Network, filed about 100 petitions using Right to Information She went and tried to get different types of information from different ministries of the Government of India
 lekin jo saamne aayaa wo acha anubhav nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Either the right answer is not given or the answer is given by the government, then it is one that does not fall before the common man
 jaankariyon se raashtra ke hiton ko khatra!bahut saamaanya tarah kii jaankariyon kaa jawaab dene main bhi laal fitaashahee kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It is said in the bureaucratic way that this information cannot be given due to being under different sections of RTI
 kai baar jawaab main ye bhi kaha jaataa he ki is tarah kii jaankaree dene se raashtra ke hiton ko kshati pahunch sakati he yaa yah ‘third party information’ he
 This attitude simply means that the information sought will not be given
 kareeb kareeb har vibhaag kaa yahi haal he
 The 'classified information' of the Civil Aviation Ministry here illustrates the attitude of government departments with some examples
 jaise ki jab civil aviation ministry se us order kii copy maangi gai jisamen congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke damaad or priyanka gandhi ke pati robert wadra ko hawaii addon par jamatlashi se chhot kaa visheshadhikaar waapas le liya gaya he, to jawaab mila ki ye sikret he, yani order kii copy nahin di ja sakati
 Now the question arises here, what is the secret related to the copy of the order, which will become public if a mountain is broken
 civil aviation ministry se hi jab artiai ke tahat aise vyaktiyon kii fehrist dene ke liye kaha gaya jo vibhinn airports par apane vaahan ko taramak tak le jane ke liye adhikrut hai, to jawaab mila ki ye ‘clacyphid information’ he
 Did not get information related to Gurmeet Ram Rahim, Gurmeet Ram Rahim, convicted of rape by two sadhists, is now serving a 20-year sentence in Rohtak's Sunaria Jail
 deraamukhi gurmeet ram rahim ko lekar civil aviation ministry se hi artiai ke tahat uske airport par rigerv lounj ke istemaal sambandhi aadesh kii copy maangi gai to jawaab mila ki ye soochna artiai se excempted he yani soochna nahin di ja sakati
 Here the question arises whether ordinary citizens of the country do not have the right to get such information also
 aisa nahin ki sirf civil aviation ministry kaa hi artiai ko lekar aisa ravaiya he
 When the Railway Ministry was asked when to start talking to Japan about the bullet train? It was also asked whether the bullet train project was included in the 'india-japan 2013 Agreement'? The reply received by the Railway Ministry was astonishing
 railway ne jaankaree maangane ke haq par hi uthaaya sawaljawab main kaha gaya ki ‘aap soochna ke adhikaar kaa istemaal karte hue chhadam rup se sarkaar ke kaaryon kii pravriti or mahatta ke bare main sawaal puch rahe hai or sarkaar aapako soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat is tarah kii jaankaree dene ke liye baadhya nahin he
 That is, the answer was not received from the Ministry of Railways, the question was put on the right to ask for information
 rail mantralay se hi jab artiai ke tahat bullate train ke maujuuda samjhaute kii copy maangi gai to jawaab mila ki ye soochna artiai ke daayre se baahar he, saath hi ise uplabdh karaayaa gaya to ye or nuksaanon ke alaava donon deshon (bharat-japan) ke sambandhon ko bhi kshati pahunchaa saktaa he
 The simple meaning of such an answer is that it will not be told when the talk started on the bullet train, what is in the agreement? This attitude is completely contrary to the claims of the government that complete transparency is exercised in the functioning of the government
 PMO se nahin mili modi ke dauron se sambandhit jaankarpub baat karte hai piemo yani pradhanmantri karyaalay kii
 The PMO was asked under RTI to inform people who are friends or family members of the Prime Minister on foreign tours with him
 iskaa jawaab mila ki ye soochna artiai se excempted he or aisi list ko saarvajanik karnaa suraksha hito main sahi nahin hoga
 When the information was sought from the PMO under RTI, who decides which country the Prime Minister should visit, who decides it
 pradhanmantri ke 2015 main pakistan ke daure kaa faisla kab or kiski ore se liya gaya to iskaa bhi jawaab vahi mila ki suraksha nihitarth (security Implications) he or ye soochna artiai ke daayre main nahin aati
 When the PMO was asked on which foreign visits of the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister had also accompanied him, the answer was received, the Prime Minister's Office is not aware of it
 grih mantralay kaa ravaiya bhi koi alag nahingrih mantralay kaa ravaiya bhi koi alag nahin dikhaa
 Under the RTI, information was sought from the Ministry of Home Affairs about what kind of security has been provided to Yogguru Ramdev? How much does it cost? The reply received from the Ministry of Home Affairs also looked similar to other ministries
 yani third party informansion he, iske suraksha nihitarth hai, ye artiai ke daayre main nahin aati
 We turned to the Delhi Police through RTI
 artiai ke tahat jaankaree maangi gai ki dilli police main vibhinn str par kitne pad khaali hai? kitne pulicekarmi viipi security main lage hue hai? dilachasp he ki is par dilli police ke har jone or vibhaag kii ore se apane apane jawaab aa rahe hai
 By collecting them, only a solid information expert can be extracted, it does not belong to ordinary citizens
 kisi apil kaa koi khaas asar nahinartiai act ke tahat praavdhaan he ki agar aap jawaab se santusht nahin he to apil daakhil kii ja sakati he
 If we tried this route, it did not appear to have any significant result
 masalan, grih mantralay se poocha gaya ki aakhri jin paanch logon ko suraksha muhaiyaa karai gai, unke naam bataaie, saath hi suraksha ke aadesh kii file noting kii copy uplabdh karai jaae
 The reply from the Ministry of Home Affairs was that this information was obtained from RTI
 grih mantralay ke is jawaab ke khilaaf apil kii gai to vahaan se jawaab mila ki aapako samuchit jawaab de diya gaya he
 The meaning of this whole exercise through RTI was that wherever the government saw the possibility of getting a little bit of questions or posing a threat to the finger, it was forbidden to give information by citing various kinds of rules
 aisi sthiti main apil bhi kii jaae to bhi jo jaankaree aap chaahate hai wo aapako mil jaae, aisi kam hi sambhaavna he
 Intensive care unit is in RTI To achieve life through RTI, the first thing you must have is time, patience and courage
 aapaki kismat acchhee ho to shaayad aapako soochna mil jaae
 Otherwise the Right to Information itself appears admitted in the Intensive Care Unit
 artiai khud khuli hawa main saans le sake iske liye surgery yaa jivan rakshak dawaaon ke jariye jo bhi ilaaj jaruri ho tatkaal uplabdh karaane kii jarurat he

 After defeating South Africa 5–1 in the ODI series, the Indian team will also look down on their rivals to continue their winning streak by hurting their losses in the three T20 series starting tomorrow in Johannesburg

 Raina will be on sight In this series, all eyes will be on Suresh Raina, who is returning to the national team after a year
 test siries main haar ab beeti baat lagati he tathaa bharat tii-20 siries main jeet ke daavedaar ke rup main shuruyaat karegaa
 The spin duo of Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav are all set to take the South African batsmen test again
 africa main hi bharat ne jeeta tha pehla tii-20 world kapabharat kii south africa sarajameen par tii-20 main acchhee yaaden judi hai

 Raina was not picked in the team despite performing well in the IPL by Gujarat Lions
 baad main pataa chalaa ki vah anivaary yo-yo test paas nahin kar paae the or isliye unka chayan nahin kiya gaya
 Raina passed this test in December and scored 314 runs in nine matches for Uttar Pradesh in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy with the help of a century and two half-centuries
 raina ke plaing ilevan main jagah banane kii puri sambhaavna he, lekin unke pradarshan par kareebi nigaah rahegi kyonki bharat ko march main srilanka main bhi tii-20 tri siries khelni he
 Raina can also clear the way for a return to the ODI squad for next year's World Cup by doing well here as the Indian team management is still looking for an all-round option that can fit in the middle order especially as the number four batsman

 On the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute, All India Muslim Personal Law Board General Secretary Maulana Wali Rahmani said today that Kapil Sibal had spoken to him and other Muslim parties to hear the matter after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 Rahmani said that it is absolutely right that this is not the right time to hear the Ayodhya case
 unka maananaa he ki agar is maamle kii agali sunwaayee shuru hui to iskaa raajnneetik phayda uthaaya jayega
 He said the matter was heard yesterday and BJP President Amit Shah responded to Sibal's statement
 agar maamle kii niyamit sunwaayee hui to kya hoga, iskaa andaja aasaani se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 On the question that the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board is hearing the Ayodhya case as soon as possible and asking for settlement

" mujhe yah nahin pataa ki muslim paksh kii taraf se pesh hue vakil kapil sibbal ne kiske nirdesh par 2019 main sunwaayee kii baat kahi
 He said that Sibal had probably appeared on behalf of Iqbal Ansari, son of Hashim Ansari, who was the main litigant in the Ayodhya episode

 After the remarks made to a daily newspaper regarding the Congress party and its general secretary Rahul Gandhi, Union Law Minister Salman Khurshid kept on clarifying throughout the day that his remarks were misinterpreted
 khurshid ke is bayaan ne bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ko congress ko gherne kaa ek mauka bhi diya
 Khurshid had said in an interview to 'the Indian Express' on Monday that the Congress was not getting any kind of ideological direction from Rahul Gandhi as he seldom had his thoughts and thinking
 khurshid ke is bayaan par mangalvaar ko jab bavaal machaa to unhone apni safai main patrakaron se kaha, "mujhase kuch prashn puche gaye the or maine jo kuch bhi kaha uskaa galat arth nikaala gaya
 If you (media) are unable to understand the comments correctly then many other issues will be discussed only within the party
 " unhone apni tippanee ko spasht karte hue is baat se inkaar kiya ki rahul apni jimmedaariyaan nahin sambhalate hai

" maine aisa nahin kaha ki vah yah nahin kar rahe hai
 i said that our new generation of leaders should prepare themselves to face new challenges

 He said, "we want to face them
 ham vishwaas ke saath unka saamana karenge
 We will face these challenges in such a way that at the end of our government's five-year term, we can present a very positive and constructive story of the country

 yadi aap (media) tippaniyon ko sahi dhang se samaj paane main aksham hai to kai anya muddon par keval party ke andar hi charchaa kii jaaegi

 "he said," i did not say that the Congress is directionless and there is no citation anywhere in the entire report and if i have said anything like that it means that i am calling myself directionless
 " Khurshid told the media that he should take the statements given by the government seriously because the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is ready to face global and domestic challenges
 unhone kaha, "ham unka saamana karnaa chaahate hai
 We will face them with confidence

 Reacting to Khurshid's statement, BJP national spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters that it is clear from Khurshid's statement that the Congress is directionless
 khurshid kaa bayaan unke vichaaron kii pushti karata he
 Prasad said, "the surprising thing is that this statement is coming from a senior minister in the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government
" yadi unka aisa kahana he ki congress dishaheen he to desh kii sthiti khatre main he
 "comments prasad ne rahul par khurshid ke bayaan ko haasyaaspad qaraar diya
 "he (khurshid) said that Rahul has made a brief display of his thoughts and thinking, which means that Rahul has no clear idea, which is also being confirmed by senior ministers of the government
" " Prasad said that Khurshid's statement also raised a finger on the functioning of Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 unhone kaha, "anischitata kii sthiti desh ke liye thik nahin he

 The Prime Minister expressed concern over the decreasing attachment of people to books in the country
 unhone kaha ki aaj kii nai peedi kisi cheez ko padhane yaa jaanane ke liye librari yaa kitabon kaa sahaara nahin leti, balki vah 'google guru'kaa sahaara leti he
 Modi compared Bhalchandra to the country's renowned philosopher Sri Aurobindo and said that the way Aurobindo speaks of returning to his original roots after reading the language and literature of the world, in the same way Bhalchandra also talks about his origin
 aapako bataa den ki bhalchandra nemaade chauthe marathi lekhak hai jinhen bhartiya gyanpith puraskaar diya gaya he

Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, contesting from Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal seat on a Bharatiya Janata Party ticket, has said that this election will prove that saffron terrorism does not happen
 sadhvi pragna ne aarope lagaaya ki jo digvijay singh bhagava aatank ke sutaradhar rahe hai, vahi is chunaav main lard rahe hai
 In such a situation, this election will prove saffron terrorism wrong
 tivi today network ke news diarector rahul kanwal se khaas baatcheet main maalegaanv blast cese ke aarope main jail kii sajaa kaat chukin sadhvi pragna ne bataaya ki wo apane aadhyatmik jivan main bahut khush thim, lekin bhagava ko badnaam karne vaale shaks ko haraane ke liye chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya
 Sadhvi said that Congress works against the country and religion
 bhagava jaise tyaag ke pratik ko congress aatank se jodne kaa kaam kiya he
 Sadhvi also targeted the Congress for the action taken against her
 sadhvi ne kaha, 'congress kii upie sarkaar ne 2008 main shadyantr karke mujhe jail main daalaa
 Tortured terrible
 bhagava aatankwaad siddh karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Tortured so much that was unthinkable and unbearable
 nau saal tak maine yatnaaen jhelin'
 While narrating her story, Sadhvi Pragya once again blamed the martyr Hemant Karkare for this torture
 sadhvi pragna ne kaha ki hemanth karkare kii team main poochtacha ke dauraan mujhe jamkar gaaliyaan di gayi
 So much pain that no one can imagine
 ek sadhvi or uske kapadeko gaaliyaan di jaati thim
 i was beaten without question
 in yaatnaaon kaa aarope lagaate hue sadhvi pragna ne digvijay singh par hindutv va bhagava ko badnaam karne vaala sutaradhar bataaya
 Sadhvi Pragya Singh said, 'how can he (digvijay Singh) say that he is a Hindu
 unhone media ke saamne bolaa he ki hindutv mere agenda main nahin he
 If he were a Hindu, how could he call saffron terrorism? jab sadhvi pragna se sawaal kiya gaya ki kya digvijay singh unke liye villen number van hai to iskaa jawaab dete hue sadhvi ne kaha, 'wo ek vyakti hai
 We have a fight against this type of ideology
 lekin aisa kyon hota he ki jo deshhit kii baat karata he use jail main daal diya jaataa he'
 But when he was asked that when the word saffron terrorism came, the then Home Secretary RK Singh is now with the BJP, then he refused to answer
 saath hi bhagava aatankwaad yaa islamic aatankwaad ko lekar jab unase sawaal kiya gaya to sadhvi ne kaha ki ye dekhnaa padataa he ki paramparaayen kya rahi hai
 He said that Indian culture has not been militant, while he responded by linking Islamic terrorism with the traditions of cutting and cutting
 bhopal seat se congress ke digvijay singh ke khilaaf chunaav ladane par sadhvi pragna ne bataaya ki main ye chunaav isliye lard rahi hum ki aise shabdon (bhagava aatankwaad) ko desh main sthapit karne or bhagava ko badnaam karne kaa prayaas fail kiya jaae
 He said that in this election it will be proved that saffron cannot be terrorism

 Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said to give reservation to SC and ST class in appointment of judges in lower courts
 aapako yaad dilaa duun ki isi saal modi sarkaar ne supreme court kaa vah faisla palat diya tha jisamen essi asti atrocity act main kuch badlaav kiye gaye the
 This was also an issue in the recent assembly elections and it is believed that the BJP, especially in Madhya Pradesh, had to face the ire of the upper castes for this reason
 kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne lakhanu main mangalvaar ko ek kaarykram main kaha ki nichali adaalaton main niyukti ke liye akhil bhartiya nyaayik seva banaai ja sakati he jisamen upiessi civil seva kii hi tarj par akhil bhartiya str par jajon kii niyukti ke liye pariksha karen
 In this, reservation can be given to SC / ST category
 pariksha ke baad jajon kii niyuktiyaan rajyon main kii ja sakati hai
 Ravi Shankar Prasad told the Times of India that if reservation is given, the deprived sections will also get an opportunity to come to such posts
 vaise kanoon mantri ne pichde varg kaa zikr nahin kiya lekin mana ja rahaa he ki mandal kamishan ko lagu karne vaale supreme court ke faisle ke maddenjar is prastaavit nyaayik seva main bhi obisi aarakshan hoga
 Let me tell you that a large number of vacancies in lower courts across the country have come up as a big problem
 centre sarkaar 5400 se adhik rictiyon ko bharne ke liye supreme court se mil kar kaam kar rahi he
 Meanwhile, a proposal has been made to appoint district judges and additional session judges in states and union territories through national examination through UPSC or any other central agency
 centre ke isi prastaav ko supreme court ne pichley saal yachika ke rup main badal diya or sabhi rajyon, centre shasit pradeshon or hai court ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga
 Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi has expressed his desire to fill these posts immediately for the early disposal of about one crore three crore cases pending in the lower courts
 abhi nichali adaalaton main jajon kii niyukti rajya lok seva aayogon or hai court kii ore se parikshaon ke jariye hoti he
 In these, the question of reservation has been arising because the representation of SC, ST and OBC category is very less
 centre sarkaar ne pichley saal 24 hoicourt ko patr likh kar nyaaypalika main in virgon kii numaaindgi ke aankade maange the
 Only 11 states have responded
 madhya pradesh or odisha ko chhod kisi anya bade rajya ne jawaab bhi nahin diya
 These figures showed that out of a total of 3973 judges, 563 SC, 478 ST and 457 OBC judges are there
 yah kareeb 38 pratishat he
 While no figures of the judges of these classes could be found in the big courts
 jajon kii niyukti main aarakshan kaa prastaav modi sarkaar pehle bhi de chuki he
 Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan has been very vocal about this
 haalanki adaalatein ise lekar sakaaratmak nahin raheen
 In November 2014, the Patna High Court rejected the notification of the Bihar government asking for reservation of SC, ST and backward in the appointment of judges of lower courts
 supreme court uttarakhand ke ek jila stareey jaj kii us yachika ko khaarij kar chukaa he jisamen jajon kii niyukti main essi / asti ko aarakshan dene ke liye hai court ko nirdesh dene ko kaha gaya tha
 The government has also talked about reservation for a member of SC ST OBC, minority or woman in the National Judicial Appointments Commission set up for appointment in major courts
 haalanki is ayog ke kanoon ko supreme court khaarij kar chukaa he
 So will this Modi government's bet just before the election prove effective? Or does he not have to bear the displeasure of the upper castes somewhere? Disclaimer (disclaimer): The views expressed in this article are the personal views of the author

 kendriya cabinet ne savarna jatiyon ke aarthik rup se kamjor logon ko sarkari naukariyon main 10 fisadi kaa aarakshan dene ke prastaav ko manjuuri de di he
 This proposal will be in addition to the 50 per cent reservation prescribed at present, i
e
 it will be given within the general seats only
 lekin sarkaar ke is kadam par sawaal uthne shuru ho gaye hai
 This proposal is being considered against the basic spirit of the Constitution
 is prastaav par mukhya rup se teen tarah ke sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai
 1
 savarna pratinidhitiv kaa savansal main samvidhan main aarakshan kaa jo praavdhaan kiya gaya he, vah un jatiyon or virgon ke liye kiya gaya jo saamaajik rup se pichhadi hai or jinka sarkari naukariyon, raajnneeti, shiksha jaisi pramukh jagahon par samuchit pratinidhitiv nahin he
 On this basis, upper caste reservation is not logical as compared to Dalit-backward classes
 isaki vajah yah he ki in sabhi jagahon par savarnon kaa uchit pratinidhitiv dikhataa he
 2
 savarna samudaay kaa koi survey nahinswarna aarakshan ke raste main ek duusari sabase badi aadchan yah he ki desh main savarnon ke saamaajik-aarthik str yaa unki sankhya ko lekar abhi tak koi survey nahin karaayaa gaya he
 The caste census work had started, but it was closed in between
 isliye aakhir savarnon ko aarakshan dene kaa rasta or tarika kya hoga? aarthik pichhadepan ko kaise tay kiya jayega? ise lekar anuttarit sawaal khadey hai
 3
 jati yaa varg ke aadhaar par miltaa he aarakshan, aarthik aadhaar par nahinsanvidhan main aarakshan dene ke peeche soch yah he ki un tabakon ko samaaj kii mukhya dhara main laayaa jaae to saamaajik rup se upeksha yaa pichhadepan kaa shikaar hai
 The upper caste community does not come in this criterion
 aarakshan dene kaa adhikaar jati yaa varg ko isliye banaaya gaya kyonki desh main kai jatiyon-virgon ke log saamaajik rup se bhedbhaav, upeksha kaa shikaar rahe hai
 Reservation was given to bring these castes into the mainstream
 aarakshan asal main garibi dur karne kaa aujaar nahin, balkisamaajik bhedbhaavdaur karne kaa saadhan he
 Therefore, it does not seem to be understandable that how the government will give financially reservations after going against the basic spirit of the Constitution

 On 6 April, the Karnataka government ordered Naseera to initiate an inquiry into the death of DK Ravi

 Sushil Modi said that of the 16 people convicted, including Lalu Prasad, in this case involving the Rs 950 crore fodder scam, 8 accused are from upper castes, including Vidyasagar Nishad and Jagdish Sharma
 vahiin duusari taraf jagannatha mishra samet jin aath logon ko bari kiya gaya he, unamem se 4 log dalit or pichhadi jatiyon se aate hai
 Modi said that the people of RJD are blaming the judiciary with casteism, blinded by the facts
 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye duusare charan kaa matdaan khatm hote hi bijepi ne bhi apni chunavi ranneeti kaa doosraa charan shuru kar diya he
 This is the phase in which the BJP is using every arrow in its quiver
 ise hindutv 2
 0 is named
 yani modi-shah kaa vah hindutv jo vaajapeyi-adwani ke hindutv se bilkul alag he
 When it was the era of Mandal Mandal, a new form of Hindutva has been created by combining Mandir and Mandal
 yah aakraamak hindutv he jo khulkar dhruvikaran karata he
 In this, he has been jailed on the charges of bomb blasts and has not even been averse to giving a ticket to Sadhvi on bail
 wo ise dharm yuddh bataati hai
 There is a touch of development in it
 balakot or udi ke baad hue sargical or air strike kaa zikr karte hue rashtrawaad or rashtriya suraksha kaa tadakaa he
 The opposition is still accused of appeasement and is calling for a war against dynasty
 us par tukade-tukade gang kii numaaindgi karne kaa aarope chaspa kar diya jaataa he
 The opposition is also accused of being an enemy of Pakistan and an enemy of the country
 is hindutv main aarthik tarakkee kaa aisa model he jo samaaj ke un tabakon ko saath lene kii koshish karata he jo ab tak bijepi se dur rahe or duusari partiyon ke vot bank ke rup main kaam karte rahe
 This form of militant Hindutva does not look apologetic in any way
 use aalochanaon kii parvaah nahin
 Ignorant of the allegations of deteriorating the fabric of the country and communal harmony
 antarrashtriya str par banaai jaati bharat kii ashishnu chhavi se jaraa bhi phikrmand nahin
 This is the form of Hindutva that is represented by the BJP prepared by modi-shah's electoral machinery, which is seen ready for the election round the clock, 24 hours a day
 maalegaanv bam dhamaakon kii aaropee sadhvi pragna thakur ko bhopal se digvijay singh ke khilaaf khadaa karnaa isi hindutv kii nishaani he
 This is the decision of the RSS
 jis par modi-shah kii muhar he
 This is an attempt to put the Congress in the dock which is already finding itself helpless in front of the aggressive Hindutva of the BJP
 congress kaa hindutv narm hindutv kaha ja rahaa he jisamen tivi camaron ke saamne mandiron ke chakkar lagaana or namakan bharne se pehle havan karnaa jaruri he
 It is also a testament to the helplessness of the Congress that when Sadhvi's rival Digvijay Singh comes in front of the camera, he praises the Narmada by applying tilak on the frontal
 sadhvi kii ummidavaari par congress apane pravaktaaon ko tivi dibet main bhejne se manaa kar detii he
 Congress spokesperson says that this is an attempt to polarize
 uske sahyogi jarur soshal media ke jariye bijepi ke is faisle par aakraamak hote hai
 Omar Abdullah tweets
 bijepi ne apane ummidavaar se kanoon vyavastha kaa makhul banaaya he
 a man who is accused of terrorism and is on trial as well as on bail on health grounds is fit to contest in the summer
 hindutv kaa shashan he
 Notwithstanding these criticisms, the BJP has started the second phase of its campaign
 kaam ruke naa, desh jhuke naa kaa naaraa bhi phir ek baar modi sarkaar ke naare main mila diya gaya he
 The effort is to keep both nationalism and development issues together
 par sawaal he ki kattar hindutv par chalanaa bijepi kii majaburi he yaa ranneeti? bijepi ke is nae daanv kaa congress ke paas kya he jawaab? Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday that the last decade under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was as 'ruined' as the decision-making process had gone out of the Prime Minister's Office, which is not the case now
 jetali ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main koi bahari hastkshep nahin he

 The Calcutta High Court has granted anticipatory bail to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Mukul Roy in the murder case of Trinamool Congress MLA Satyajit Biswas from Krishnaganj Assembly in Nadia district of West Bengal
 court ne 26 farvari tak unki giraftaar par roak laga di he
 The Trinamool Congress blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party on the issue of its MLA being shot dead
 jabaki hansakhaali police dwaara darj kii gai exiaar main mukul roy kaa bhi naam shaamil tha, saath hi do anya logon kii giraftaar hui thi
 In fact, on 9 February, TMC MLA Satyajit Biswas along with his wife and 7-month-old son had gone to the Saraswati Puja event where they were shot and killed by unknown assailants
 vidhayak kii hatya ke baad rajya main raajnneeti shuru ho gai jab jail mantri ujjwal biswas ne tiemasi vidhayak kii hatya ke liye sidhe pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 So at the same time, BJP demanded a CBI inquiry, blaming TMC infighting behind this murder

 The GST rate reduction on real estate may be announced on Wednesday
 sutron ke mutabik anderconstruction gharon par jiesti kaa rate 18 fisadi se ghataakar 5 fisadi karne kaa prastaav he
 The GST Council, the supreme body of the Goods and Services Tax, is scheduled to meet on Wednesday through video conferencing, which includes an agenda to cut GST on real estate
 council real estate ke liye do slab kaa elaan kar sakati he
 The first slab, the new rate for underconstruction housing, can be declared at 5 percent and the GST rate for cheap homes at 3 percent
 philhal anderconstruction gharon ke liye jiesti kaa standard rate 18 fisadi he jabaki saste gharon yani afordable houseing ke upar 8 fisadi kii dar se jiesti lagata he
 The price of land is subtracted from the standard rate because currently the land falls under the jurisdiction of the states, hence the effective rate of GST is about 12 percent instead of 18 percent
 sutron ke mutabik council houseing par jiesti dar kii kami ke saath input credit ko hataa sakati he
 Currently the builder gets input credit
 haalanki kai developers yaa bilders iskaa phayda ghar kharidne waalon ko nahin dete
 Sumit Dutt Majumdar, former chairman, CBEC, says that it is an important decision that the benefit of GST rate reduction will be given but input credit will not be available
 iskaa sidhaa matlab hua ki bakaayaa input tex ek badi laagat ke rup main khadaa ho saktaa he
 Before GST , there were many duties or taxes on real estate, including service tax on construction and rent and excise duty on input material

 The Congress on Monday made it clear that it has not given a call for 'bharat Bandh' on Monday, but protests will be held across the country on the issue of demonetisation
 party ne aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar kaa yah faisla raajnneetik kadam he, jise bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ke rup main bhunaaya ja rahaa he
 Party leader Jairam Ramesh told reporters in New Delhi that Prime Minister Narendra Modi believed in 'big bang' politics and the decision to discontinue big notes was taken because he saw some 'possibilities' in Uttar Pradesh, where elections next year Are to be
 ramesh ne daawa kiya ki videshon main jamaa kaledhan ko waapas laane ke pradhanmantri ke bade chunavi vaade ko puraa karne main sarkaar kii naakaami ko dhakne ke liye 1000 or 500 rupee ke noton ko band kiya gaya tha or modi kuch 'naatakeey' karnaa chaahate the
 Taking a dig at the central government, he said, "this is a political move, which is being sold as a fight against corruption
" ' ramesh ne kaha ki avaidh tareekon se dhan jamaa karne vaale logon ko pareshaani nahin ho rahi he, lekin un logon ko kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, jinke paas kalaadhan nahin he
 Ramesh said, 'unfortunately those who needed an attack escaped
 ' ramesh ke mutabik 'suut-boot' vaale logon kaa ek varg ab bhi vilasita kii jindagi ji rahaa he
 Former Union Minister Ramesh claimed that the BJP was spreading false information that the Congress and other parties had called for 'bharat Bandh'
 unhone kaha ki vipakshi dal somvaar ko 'jan aakrosh diwas' manaayenge or deshbhar main virodh pradarshan karenge
 Taking a dig at the Modi government, Ramesh said that economic activities have stopped since November 9
 sansad main vipaksh kii ranneeti ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki agar pradhanmantri charchaa main hissaa lete hai, to charchaa hogi
 He also questioned the government's readiness to bring in new notes and said that according to estimates it may take 250 days for the printing of new notes and to get the economy back on track
 ramesh ne 'cashles' yaa 'lescash' samaaj ke pradhanmantri ke aahvaan kii bhi aalochana karte hue kaha ki bharat main badi sankhya main log dainik lenden main nakadi kaa istemaal karte hai
 When Ramesh was asked why Congress ally JDU leader Nitish Kumar was not in support of the protest against demonetisation, he said that JDU leader Sharad Yadav is supporting it
 unhone daawa kiya ki notebandi ke vichaar ke peeche pune kaa jo sanghathan he, usne bhi kaha he ki jis tareeke se ise lagu kiya ja rahaa he, us tarah kaa suzav unka nahin tha
 The comments congress netaa ne kaha ki unki party is kadam ke makasad ke khilaaf nahin he or kaledhan tathaa bhrashtachar ke khilaaf kadamon kaa samarthan karegi, lekin halaat kii hakeekat alag he
 He said that only two percent people in the country do cashless transactions, it will take some time to make the country completely cashless
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) party netaa jairam ramesh ne nai dilli main samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi 'dhamaakaa' raajnneeti main bharosa rakhte hai or bade noton ko band karne kaa faisla isliye liya gaya kyonki unhen uttar pradesh main kuch 'sambhaavnaaen' dikhaai deen, jahaan agle saal chunaav hone hai
 Ramesh claimed that 1000 and 500 rupee notes were closed to cover the government's failure to fulfill the Prime Minister's big election promise to bring back black money stashed abroad and that Modi wanted to do something 'dramatic'
 unhone centre sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, 'yah ek raajnneetik kadam he, jise bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ke rup main bechaa ja rahaa he
 Ramesh said that people who deposit money by illegal means are not having trouble, but those people are facing difficulties who do not have black money
 ramesh ne kaha, 'durbhaagya se jin logon par hamale kii jarurat thi, ve bachakar nikal gaye
 According to Ramesh, a section of 'suit-boot' people are still living a life of luxury
 purv kendriya mantri ramesh ne daawa kiya ki bhaajapa yah galat jaankaree failaa rahi he ki congress or anya dalon ne 'bharat band' kaa aahvaan kiya he
 He said that the opposition parties would celebrate 'jan Aakrosh Day' on Monday and would organize protests across the country
 modi sarkaar ko aade haath lete hue ramesh ne kaha ki 9 november se aarthik gatividhiyaan thahar gai hai
 On the question of the opposition's strategy in Parliament, he said that if the Prime Minister participates in the discussion, then there will be discussion
 unhone nae note laane main sarkaar kii taiyaari par bhi sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki anumaan ke mutabik naye noton kii chapai main or arthvyavastha ko patari par laane main 250 din lag sakate hai
 Ramesh also criticized the call of the Prime Minister of the 'cashless' or 'lescash' society, saying that a large number of people in India use cash in daily transactions
 jab ramesh se poocha gaya ki congress kii sahyogi jediu ke netaa nitish kumaar notebandi ke khilaaf pradarshan ke samarthan main kyon nahin hai, to unhone kaha ki jediu netaa sharad yadav iskaa samarthan kar rahe hai
