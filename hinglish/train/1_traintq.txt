 There is again a news about the death of ISEIS kingpin Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi
 syria ke state televijan ne daawa kiya he ki syria ke rakka shahar main 11 june ko hue hawaii hamale main bagdadi maaraa gaya he
 By the way, before the world believes in Baghdadi's death, let us tell you that this is the seventh news of Baghdadi's death in the last two years
 yani ye he bagdadi kii saatvin maut
 The claim of an attack on Baghdadi has once again claimed the biggest attack on Baghdadi ever
 daawa ye ki syria main uske garh rakka main aasmaan se hui he safed maut kii barish or is barish main maaraa gaya duniya kaa sabase khoonkhaar aatanki or iesas kaa sargana abu bakar al bagdadi
 This white death is the same as that which was rained by the Russian Air Force in the city of Idlib, Syria about one and a half years ago
 jab raat ke andhere main aasmaan safed roshni se chamachama uthaa or phir naarangi aag ne puure ilaake ko apni agosh main le liya
 When all this stopped, everything in the area was burnt down due to fire
 ab bilkul vaisaa hi hamale kaa daawa syria ke us shahar rakka main kiye jane kaa daawa hua he jo bagdadi or iesas kaa garh he
 Syrian State Television reported that Syria's state television claimed that Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the head of ISIS, had been killed in the white phosphorus bombing of Syria and the coalition forces in the city of Raqqa
 ek bade videshi akhbaar main chhapi khabaren or internet par jari huin hamale kii footage ke mutabik, gathbandhan sena ne syria ke rakka main aatanki thikaanon par tabadatod hamale kiye
 It is clear in the footage that the army attacked the building in a particular area of raqqa with a white phosphorus bomb
 mana ja rahaa he ki jis ilaake ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya, vahaan na sirf iesas ke hathiyaaron kaa zakhira tha balki khud iesas kaa sargana abu bakar al bagdadi bhi maujuud tha
 Baghdadisiriya State Television, killed in Phosphorus attack, claims that the world's most feared terrorist has been killed in this Phosphorus attack
 haalanki abhi kisi agency ne is daawey kii pushti nahin kii he or na hi iesas kii taraf se aisi koi pushti hui he
 But it is being said that the footage related to the attack on the Internet has been released by the news agency Amaq, which belongs to the organization itself
 vahiin intelligence agenciyon ne bhi ye daawa kiya he ki ye sahi he ki aatanki group kaa leader bagdadi mosul se bhagkar syria main apni swaghoshit rajdhani rakka kii taraf gaya he
 Because of this claim, Syrian army officials are not backing down from confirming Baghdadi's death on social media
 uttaradhikari kii bhi ho chuki mautbagadadi ke maare jane kii khabar aise vaqt main ai he, jab uske uttaradhikari bataae ja rahe ayaad al jumali ko syria-iraq seemaa par hawaii hamale main maar giraaya gaya he
 Jumali was the second largest leader and minister of war of ISIS
 bhale kisi badi agency ne bagdadi kii maut kii pushti na kii ho magar sirian state television ke alaava sirian activist, rakka24 sahit kai or media santhaan is khabar kii pushti kar rahe hai
 However, the uk-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has acknowledged that coalition forces have carried out airstrikes on Raqqa, in which 13 civilians have been reported dead
 ye pehali baar nahin he jab bagdadi kii maut kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 25 million dollar reward on Baghdadi
 Even before this, such claims have been made many times, but each time this 25 million dollar dreaded terrorist becomes alive even after dying
 rakka shahar main gathbandhan senahavai hamale kii batato kai agenciyaan maan rahi hai
 Many people are also confirmed dead in this attack
 magar bagdadi kii maut ko lekar america samet baaki ke desh philhal kisi bhi tarah kaa daawa karne se batch rahe hai
 One reason for this is that it can also be the propaganda of the Syrian army to encourage the army and another reason for not confirming the death of Baghdadi is that the news of his death has been reported six times before
 
 bagdadi kii maut par ndehbagadadi ke maare jane kii sirian state television kii khabar sukun dene vaali zarur he, magar ye khabar sahi ho us par itani aasaani se yakeen nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The reason for this is that even before this, about 7 such occasions have come when the world heard the news of Baghdadi's death
 magar har baar wo khabaren galat sabit huin
 There were reports in the media that Baghdadi was killed in an airstrike by coalition forces in al-baz city of Ninewah province, Iraq, bordering the Syrian border
 bataaya gaya ki ye hamalaa tab hua jab bagdadi apane khaas logon ke saath ye meeting kar rahaa tha ki uskaa naayab koun hoga
 However, a month later, on 22 April, there was news again that Baghdadi was not killed but due to spinal injury his body has been paralyzed
 america ne khabaron se kiya inkaarhalanki america ne in khabaron ko sach maanane se inkaar kar diya
 Taking forward the claims of the March 18 attack, The New York Times wrote that Baghdadi, who was wounded in the airstrike, was killed
 may ke maheene main da gargian kii khabar ke mutabik, iesas ke aatankiyon ne bagdadi par hamale kaa badla lene kii kasam khai or europe par hamale karne kii dhamkee di
 From this at least it was decided that Baghdadi was attacked
 magar pushti uski bhi ajtak nahin ho saki
 The Iraqi army claimed to have carried out airstrikes on a Baghdadi convoy in Anbar province near the Syrian border in which it was killed
 bataaya gaya ki wo baghdad ke nazadik kerbala ke bahari ilaakon main aatank kii ek meeting main shaamil hone ja rahaa tha
 There have been reports of death before, though later reports of Baghdadi's death were denied, saying that he was not present in this convoy
 maut ke aakhri daawey ke kareeb 9 maheene baad june 2016 main ek baar phir iraqi state tivi ne ye daawa kiya ki uttari iraq main america hawaii hamale main bagdadi maaraa gaya
 But later the news came that he was only injured in these attacks
 haalanki gathbandhan senaaon ne isaki pushti nahin kii
 Just three days later, many media institutions in the Middle East claimed that Baghdadi died
 bataaya gaya ki rakka main bagdadi kii maut america hawaii hamale main hui
 However, a newspaper later denied these reports, saying that the news came out due to a false picture circulating on the Internet
 supaari killer bhi maar chukaa he bagdadi kokhud gathbandhan senaaon ne maut kii is khabar ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 This time the news came on which people would have some hope
 khabar ye thi ki ek supaari killer ne bagdadi samet iesas ke 3 bade aatanki leaderon ko zehar dekar maar daalaa he
 Many TV channels also claimed this
 magar ye khabar bhi juthi nikali or ab sirian state television ne gathbandhan senaaon ke safed phosforus hamale main bagdadi ke maare jane kaa daawa kiya he
 Now how true this claim is, it can be decided only when an investigating agency confirms this
 philhal to is daawey ko bhi shaq kii nazar se dekha ja rahaa he
 Syrian State Television claims Baghdadi was killed in the Phosphorus attack
 phosforus hamale main bachanaa mushkilkaha ja rahaa he ki agar vaaki phosforus hamale kii jad main bagdadi aa gaya he to uskaa bachanaa naammumkin he
 In 2015, the world has seen how deadly this white attack is
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle syria main hi saal 2015 ke november maheene main roosi sena ne idalib shahar par aisa hi hawaii hamalaa kiya tha, jisamen puraa kaa puraa ilaaka jalakar khak ho gaya tha
 What can Russia do to end terror? isaki tasviir duniya ne 13 november 2015 ko dekhi, jabaaasmaan se barasati mautne syria ke us idaleeb shahar ko apni agosh main le liya jo aatankiyon or vidrohiyon kaa thikaana tha
 Fireworks suddenly started in the dark of night
 haddiyaan tak galaa detii he phosforus gasaisa laga maano saikadon rocket ek saath aasmaan se zamin kii taraf gir rahe hai, magar phir jaise hi ye rocket gaanv kii zamin se takaraate hai achaanak haroonges taur par safed dhuen kii chadar puure ilaake ko apni agosh main le leti he
 This white smoke sheet is nothing but poisonous white phosphorus gas, which makes the human body as well as its bones
 rus kii is aasamaani maut kaa video jis shaks ne banaaya wo khud behad daraa hua tha
 Actually this video was made by a social worker living in Idlib, Syria
 usne is video ko baad main twitor acount par post kiya tha
 According to eyewitnesses, on November 13, 2015, Russia launched an aerial attack on the Syrian northwest city of Idlib
 saikadon log gambhir rup se zakhmiis hamale main saikadon log gambhir rup se zakhmi ho gaye the
 Actually this city was occupied by the IAIS terrorists and that is why Russia attacked these areas
 lekin baad main khabaren ain ki yahaan par aies ke aatanki nahin balki syrian naagarik the
 These areas were 40 miles from any military base
 vaise aapako bataa den ki safed phosforus ko dablyoopi bhi kaha jaataa he or kisi bhi desh kii sena iskaa istemaal raat ke vakt apane dushmano ke thikaanon par roshni karne ke liye karti he
 During the day, it is used to throw dust in the eyes of the enemy
 isaki chapet main aane vaale kisi bhi shaks kaa dil, liver or kidney puri tarah se kshatigrast ho sakati he
 If you are caught in phosphorus gas for a long time, then it can also die
 ye bhi ek sach he ki roosi sena aies aatankiyon ke saath-saath asad virodhiyon ko bhi nishaanaa banaakar unke thikaanon par bambaari kar rahi thi
 But if these pictures are true, then there may be problems for Russia at the international level, because according to the Geneva Convention, the army of any country cannot use phosphorus or any other chemical bomb on the citizens of another country
 agar is hamale ke peeche rus he to yakeenan uski sena ne geneva canavension kaa ulanghan kiya he
 But it has not yet been confirmed that the Russian army was behind this attack

 unhone tab anuchhed 370 par satta ko kyon chunaa? bijepi muslimon or alpsankhyakon ko baahar karne ke apane vinaashkari agenda se bharat ko baantnaa chaahati he
 Let us know that Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday at a rally in Kathua, Jammu and Kashmir, while targeting the Abdullah and Mufti families, said that these two families' ruined 'three generations of Jammu and Kashmir, but they gave them to India' Will not let 'sharing'
 modi ne kaha ki jammu kashmir ke logon ko 'kuch mutthi bhar' log bandhak yaa bandhua majdoor banaakar nahin rakh sakate
 The Prime Minister's reference was to National Conference leader Omar Abdullah's demand for a separate Prime Minister for Jammu and Kashmir and Mehbooba Mufti's remark that abolishing Article 370 could free Jammu and Kashmir from India
 modi ne yahaan ek jansabha main kaha ki abdulla or mufti pariwaron ne rajya kii teen peediyaan 'barbaad' kar di
 They stuck on the road for three generations
 pradhanmantri karyaalay (piemmo) main rajya mantri jitendra singh ke liye prachaar karte hue unhone kaha ki jammu-kashmir ke logon ne pratham charan main baari sankhya main matdaan karke aatankwaad ke sarganaon, avasarwaadiyon ko 'fatkaaraa' or 'mahamilawat' gathbandhan ko 'hatotsahit' kiya
 Modi said, 'you proved the power of democracy in India in the first phase of elections
 'congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'congress keetanuon se sankramit rahi he
 This promise made by the old party in its manifesto has discouraged the security forces to remove the AFSPA if they come to power
 ' modi ne raily main kaha, 'kya koi deshbhakt aisi baat kar saktaa he? kya hamaare suraksha balon ko surakshit nahin rakhaa janaa chahie
 'modi said,' the days have passed when the Indian government used to be intimidated by threats

 ' pakistani supreme court main guuruuvaar ko pradhan nyaayadhish iftikhar choudhary kii adhyakshata vaali peeth or atorni general tathaa vakeelon ke bich tikhi bahes hui or sthiti itani bighad gai ki suraksha balon ko bulaanaa padaa
 a heated debate began as soon as the bench headed by Chaudhary began hearing the petitions filed against the disqualification by the President of the National Assembly despite Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani being found guilty of contempt of court
 sunwaayi ke dauraan atorni general irfan kaadir ne teen nyayadhishon vaali peeth main avishvaas jataayaa or kaha ki pradhan nyaayadhish ko maamle kii sunwaayi nahin kerani chahie
 When the Chief Justice asked the counsel for one of the petitioners how much time he needed to present his case, Qadir questioned why he was in such a hurry to hear the case
 atorni general ne pradhan nyaayadhish kii baat ko kai baar kaatane kaa prayaas kiya
 After this, the bench asked them not to behave indecently
 tikhi bahes sunakar vakeelon kaa ek samooh nyaayalay main bheetar aa gaya or unhone atorni general kii aalochana kerani shuru kar di
 There was a fierce debate between Qadir and the lawyers
 kaadir ne baar-baar kaha ki pradhanmantri ke khilaaf maamle kii sunwaayi kar rahe nyaayadhish gilaani ko sajaa sunaane ke baad adaalat se ‘‘bhaag gaye’’ the
 The Attorney General continuously made 'obscene gestures' which angered some lawyers
 baad main sthiti par niyantran paane ke liye suraksha balon ko bulaanaa padaa
 The Chief Justice reacted saying that everyone has the right to speak in the court but the dignity of the court should be maintained
 pradhanmantri ke vakil etjaj ahasan ne apana paksh rakhane ke liye samay maanga jiske baad nyaayalay ne maamle kii sunwaayi kal tak ke liye sthagit kar di
 The Supreme Court was hearing petitions challenging the decision of National Assembly President Fahmida Mirza to refuse to initiate the process of disqualifying Prime Minister Gilani after he was convicted of contempt of court
 isi varsh april main nyaayalay ke aadesh par raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ke khilaaf switsraland main bhrashtachar kaa maamla shuru karwaane se inkaar karne ke maamle main supreme court ne gilaani ko nyaayalay kii avmaananaa ko doshi maanate hue ek minute kii sankethik sajaa sunaayi thi
 The comments supreme court ne adhyaksh ke faisle ko chunauti dene vaali yachikaaon par pratikriya maangate hue pradhanmantri gilaani, atorni general, adhyaksh, chunaav ayog or sarkaar ko notice jari kiya tha
 These petitions have been filed by PML-N, Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf and others including lawyer Azhar Chaudhary
 duusari ore neshnal essembly or desh ke nichle sadan ne aaj pradhanmantri ko ayogy nahin ghoshit karne ke adhyaksh ke faisle ke samarthan main ek prastaav paarit kiya
 The motion was tabled by Farooq Naik, senior leader of the ruling Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and Law Minister

 During the hearing, Attorney General Irfan Qadir expressed disbelief in a three-judge bench and said that the Chief Justice should not hear the case
 pradhan nyaayadhish ne jab ek yachikakarta ke vakil se poocha ki use apana paksh rakhane ke liye kitna samay chahie, to kaadir ne sawaal kiya ki vah maamle kii sunwaayi ke liye itani jaldi main kyon hai
 The Attorney General attempted to cut the Chief Justice's point several times
 iske baad peeth ne unase abhadra vyavhaar nahin karne ko kaha
 Hearing bitter arguments, a group of lawyers entered the court and started criticizing the Attorney General
 kaadir or vakeelon main tikhi bahes hui
 Qadir repeatedly said that Judge Gilani, who was hearing the case against the Prime Minister, had "escaped" from the court after he was sentenced
 atorni general ne lagaataar ‘ashleel bhangimaayein’ banaayi jisase kuch vakil krodhit ho gaye
 Later security forces had to be summoned to take control of the situation
 pradhan nyaayadhish ne pratikriya dete hue kaha ki nyaayalay main bolne kaa sabhi ko adhikaar he lekin nyaayalay kii garima ko banaae rakhana chahie
 The Prime Minister's lawyer Etjaz Ahsan sought time to present his case, after which the court adjourned the hearing of the case till tomorrow

 In April this year, the Supreme Court sentenced Gilani to a one-minute symbolic sentence for contempt of court against President Asif Ali Zardari for refusing to initiate a corruption case in Switzerland
 tippaniyan The Supreme Court had issued notices to Prime Minister Gilani, Attorney General, Chairman, Election Commission and the government seeking response to the petitions challenging the Speaker's decision

 Narayan Sai, who had confessed his crime in the Surat rape case, was interrogated on Wednesday in front of the victim
 poochtacha ke liye peedita subah 9:30 baje krime branch ke daftar pahunchi
 He was interrogated at around 10:30
 poochtacha se judi exclusive jaankariyaan is prakaar hai-- narayan sai se jis room main poochtacha honi thi, usamen peedita or police pehle se maujuud thi
 - When Narayan Sai was brought to the room for questioning, he was shocked to see the victim
 - police ne narayan ko baithne ke liye kursi nahin di or narayan sai ko peedita ke pair ke paas bithaaya gaya
 - Sitting near the feet, Narayan Sai was looking at the victim with surprise
 jiske kaaran peedita gussa bhi ho gai
 - Based on the complaint that the victim had written to the police, the police started question-and-answer
 saal 2001 se lekar 2004, jab tak peedita ashram main rahi tab tak ke saare sawaal puche gaye
 Police asked these questions to Narayan Sai
 
 
 pehla sawaal-aap kahaan mili the?peedita- ham jahangirpura ashram main mili the
 Narayan Sai- Yes, this is true
 doosraa sawaal-vahaan par kya hua tha?peedita- narayan ne mere haath ko dabaaya tha or prasad diya tha
 Narayan did not answer this question
 teesraa sawaal-kya peedita ko desh ke alag-alag rajyon ke ashram main le jaaya gaya tha?peedita- patna ore nepal ke ashram main le gaye the
 Narayan Sai- Yes, the point is correct
 chauthaa sawaal-patna main kya-kya hua tha?peedita- dedh maheene mere vahaan par rahane ke baad narayan sai vahaan shivi ke liye aayaa tha
 Holded my hand and said why do you like me without me
 narayan sai- haa, main vahaan par gaya tha, lekin ye sab baaten mujhe yaad nahin hai
 Fifth question - When did Surat come back? The victim- Narayan Sai called me at my house and called me to the Jahangirpura ashram
 narayan sai- maine aisa koi phone nahin kiya tha
 Sixth question - Who brought the victim till the hut? The victim - Hanuman, and he was in touch with me
 narayan sai- hanuman
 Seventh question - What happened in the hut? Victim - There was Narayan Sai in the hut
 wo jis kursi par baitha tha main uske neeche baithi thi
 Narayan Sai- Yes, it was sitting near me
 aathvaan sawaal-aapane bachane ke liye prayaas kiya tha?peedita- haa, main narayan sai se dur ho gai thi phir narayan ne mujhe jabardastee jor se pakad liya tha or dhakka dekar palang par leta diya tha
 i was raped after that
 narayan sai- ye baat jhooth he, peedita kii marji se uske saath rishta banaaya gaya tha
 This girl still loves me and even before that she loved me
 main bhi usase pyaar karata tha
 Ninth question - how did you get out of there? The victim- Narayan raped me and after that i was able to get out of there
 narayan sai- maine koi balaatkaar nahin kiya he
 Whatever happened there was done by the will of the girl and she loved me
 narayan sai ke is baat ko sunakar peedita aag-babula ho gai or kaha ki agar main tumse pyaar karti to aaj bhi tumhaare ashram main hoti or tumhaara bhoga banati rahati
 Narayan Sai is fond of oral sex
 
 
 peedita kaa ye jawaab sunakar narayan sai chup ho gaya
 After which the victim not only reminded Narayan of this incident with her but also one such incident with other girls of the ashram
 peedita ne gusse main narayan sai ko ye bhi kaha ki na sirf ashram kii ladkiyaan balki baahar se profeshnal ladakiyon ko bulaakar bhi unke saath shaareerik sambadh banaae jate the
 The victim reminds one of the girls' names, Narayan Sai, one after the other
 peedita ne narayan sai ko ye bhi kaha, 'narayan sai group sex ore oral sex kaa bhi shaukeen tha
 'narayan Sai was completely silent during this time
 monica ke bare main poochtarpulice ne narayan sai se monica ke bare main poochtacha kii
 To this Narayan Sai said, 'I had no physical relationship with Monica
 ' peedita ne tunrat hi kaha ki monica ke saath bhi narayan sai ke shaareerik sabandh the
 Narayan was surprised at this
 peedita ne bataaya monica ne narayan sai kii ek film bhi banaai he, jisamen wo ek mahila ke saath dikhaai detaa he
 Police asked questions about Jamuna
 
 
 police ne poocha- jamuna ko jaanati ho? peedita- haa, jamuna ke narayan ke saath bhi rishte the or jamuna kaa betaa moksh narayan kii hi nazaij aulad he
 Narayan Sai- Yes, this is true
 narayan ke jawaab se gussa hokar peedita ne narayan ko ek khat bhi dikhaaya, jo narayan ne prem-patr ke taur par peedita ko likhaa tha
 Narayan asked the victim, 'if i am punished you will like it'? The victim replied without delay, 'yes

 NCP President Sharad Pawar said that if the Congress does not perform well in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, then its responsibility can be passed on to Rahul Gandhi
 saath hi, raajnneeti main apane saadhe chaar dashak puure kar rahe pavaar ne apane sanyas kii ghoshnaa karte hue kaha he ki vah aglaa loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladenge
 Leader of NCP and agriculture minister Pawar, a key ally in the UPA, does not seem likely to present Rahul as the prime ministerial candidate even if the Congress does well in the UP elections
 pavaar ne ek nijee channel se baatcheet main kaha, ‘congress party ne unhen (rahul gandhi ko) pesh kiya he
 He is a prominent campaigner and not Digvijay Singh or any other leader
 congress party kuch bhi kahe lekin agar vah acha pradarshan nahin kar pate to janata tathaa chunaav vishleshak nishchit taur par unhen jimmedaar tehraayenge
 The Congress has tried to undermine Pawar's statement
 congress pravaktaa abhishek singhvi ne kaha ki kisi ko shrey dena yaa jimmedaar tehraana bilkul anuchit he
 When Pawar was asked whether Rahul Gandhi would be projected as the next Prime Minister immediately after the assembly elections, he said, "I don't think the Congress will present him immediately even after the good results
" ve agle chunaavon kaa bhi intjaar kar sakate hai
 In response to a question, he said, "in today's situation, i do not see any possibility of change in the national leadership basically in the Prime Minister's post
 ’rakanpa adhyaksh ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main sapa ko chunaav ke baad anya dalon se samarthan milane kii zyada sambhaavna he
 If they are successful in forming the government, then it will be a morale boost for the Congress
 samprag kii sthirataa kii drushti se halaat main sudhaar hoga
 Pawar said, 'I don't know who will support Mayawati
 yadi mayawati kii party sabase badi party banakar ubhari to keval bhaajapa samarthan de sakati he kyonki mulaayam singh kii party unka samarthan nahin karegi
 There is no question of getting support from Ajit Singh and others
 haalanki nitin gadakari ne kahin par kaha tha ki bhaajapa sarkaar banane ke liye mayawati ko samarthan nahin degi
 He said that assembly elections in five states are not very important for the upa's stability
 unhone chunaav vaale paanch rajyon main uttar pradesh or punjab ko sabase adhik ahm bataate hue kaha ki aisa lagata he ki congress punjab main satta main aegi jo ki kandra ke lihaaj se bahut phaayde kii baat hogi
 With reference to Rahul, he said, 'one thing we have to consider is that he is touring like any other person
 kai jansabhaon ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 If the condition of the Congress improves, the credit will certainly go to him
 aisa bhi lagata he ki congress ne unhone star prachaarak ke taur par pesh karne kaa faisla soch samajhakar liya he
 In the context of electoral politics, Pawar said that he has seen a lot since he has been elected continuously since 1967
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe jaise logon kii jimmedaari he ki yuvaaon ko protsaahit kiya jaae or yuva netritv lagaataar kaam karegaa
 When asked about whether Pawar is thinking of presenting someone as NCP leader in future, he said, "I don't believe in presenting anyone
" yah ek tarah kii saamanti soch he
 Suppose someone is the king of a state, then the next generation will come and take power, it is a different matter
 yah loktantr he
 i can't say who will come eventually

 Time to think out of the box
 ' There was a major Naxalite attack in the country, but nobody saw the Home Minister
 ab bijepi sawaal khadey kar rahi he ki itane bade hamale ke baad aakhir kahaan hai grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia
 Officially the Home Minister is abroad, but should Shinde not have canceled the leave
 darasal, grih mantri 19 may ko hi offisial tour par america gaye the
 He was accompanied by a team of 12 officers
 scindia aantarik suraksha par baatcheet ke liye america gaye the jo 22 ko hi khatm ho gai
 All those who went with Shinde returned only on 25 May
 lekin grih mantri vahiin rah gaye
 It is being told that Shinde will return on May 30
 lekin sawaal ye he ki kya naksali hamale ke baad scindia ko waapas nahin aana chahie tha
 When there is a crisis on the country from America to Britain, then the President and Prime Minister of the country, wherever in the world, immediately return
 lekin jab apane bharat main chhattisgarh lahooluhaan he, grahamantri susheel kumaar scindia america main baithe hai
 Actually, this is not the first time Shinde is in controversy due to his own mistakes

 Saharanpur is once again sparking violence
 hinsa ke baad lagaataar raajnneetik bayaanbaji bhi tej ho rahi he
 While the Bharatiya Janata Party blamed Mayawati for the Saharanpur violence, the Bahujan Samaj Party has also hit back at the BJP
 mayawati ne kaha ki saharanpur main ho rahi hinsa or janmaal kii haani ke liye bijepi jimmedaar he
 The casteist elements of BJP and RSS are engaged in spoiling the social brotherhood

 The car could not go there either
 bahanji ne ravidaas mandir ke paas jaakar apni baat rakhi thim
 Satish Mishra said that Mayawati said in Saharanpur that every class is mixing

 It is a matter of regret that people were attacked on their way back
 ek kii hatya kar di gai
 The Chief Minister took note of everything and assured of action
 sipiai (em) ne kii nindaavaheen sipiai (em) ne bhi bayaan jari kar saharanpur hinsa kii ninda kii he
 The CPI (M) has said that the Hindu youth corps is responsible for the violence that followed Mayawati's rally
 mayawati ke jane se bigadaa maahaulauttar pradesh sarkaar main mantri shrikant sharma ne kaha kishgaranpur main shanti sthapitahui thi, lekin mayawati apni raajnneetik rotiyaan sekane ke liye vahaan gayi, jiske baad hi vahaan par maahaul bigadaa or hatya hui
 Shrikant Sharma said that strict action will be taken against the culprits, where there has been negligence, all the top officials are present and after the violence in Saharanpur, the police and administration are looking serious
 siem ke nirdesh ke baad grih sachiv maniprasad mishra, ediji (kanoon-vyavastha) aditya mishra, aiji (estf) amitabh yash, diaiji vijay bhushan sahit aaladhikari saharanpur main deraa jamaaye hue hai

 There are stories linking business in our history
 There are symbols in Vedas that lead to progress
 Writer Ashwin Sanghi says that i am constantly writing books
 pehle mithological kitaaben likhin
 Then crime fiction
 lekin main hameshaa se lekhak nahin rahaa hum
 i never wrote more than two pages in college or school
 lekin ek din mere baniyaa dimag main aayaa ki mere paas kahani he
 Then i called my publisher friend and asked if i wanted to write
 to usne kaha ki dimag khaali he to kuch bhi likh lo
 i wrote but the book was not published for two years
 meri kitaab 47 baar riject hui
 But during this time i learned how to face defeat
 ye behad aasaan ho jaataa he jab aap khud ke haar ke bare main baat karte hai
 The writer Ashwin Sanghi narrated these stories
 aswin bijness today ke diging for gold- lesansh from mithology seshan ke tahat bol rahe the
 i asked my grandfather what should i do
 to nanaaji ne kaha ki betaa ye chuuhe kii daud he
 Even if you win, you will remain rats
 isliye jeet jaruri nahin he
 Method is necessary
 model jaruri he
 In the Marwari Baniya society, as soon as children are born, parents do not learn the words debit-credit
 aisa har samudaay main hota he
 They have their own symbols
 jo unke bachche sikhte hai
 Lakshmi does not mean without Saraswati, Lakshmi, my maternal grandfather used to send books constantly
 patron ke jariye rivyuu mangate the ki kitaab main kya padhaa, kya siikhaa
 i went back to Nana ji and said that Munim ji says don't waste time in books
 bahikhaata sanbhaalo
 Then Nanaji said that Lakshmi is not meant without Saraswati
 jahaan saraswati jaati hai, vahaan lakshmi jaati he
 When the two are together, then Ganesha comes
 isi se bijness aage badhata he
 Lakshmi is the goddess of wealth
 saraswati gyaan kii he
 There is auspicious benefit by combining both
 itihaas wo bataate hai, jo itihaas main the hi nahinitihaas kya he- ye wo kahani he jo kuch log bataate hai, lekin unhen ye pataa nahin hota ki sach main kya hua tha itihaas main
 Nor are they there
 bas kahaniyaan sunaate hai
 We have history and mythology here
 lekin bharat main itihaas or puraana ke bich achche kaam kaa sambandh he
 We have stories here that connect real kings with them
 jinaki aaj maamuli puja hoti he, wo saalon baad bhagwaan ban jate hanjab kolkata main kisi mandir jate hai to log sochate hai ki ham devi ji ke mandir ja rahe hai
 But when i reached the temple, i saw that Amitabh Bachchan is being worshiped there
 vahaan kuli main amitabh ne jo juuta pahana tha vah ek hare rang singhaasana par rakhaa tha
 a priest was worshiping him
 vahaan se maine amitabh chalisa kitaab kharidi
 Suppose i die today
 or ek hajaar saal baad paidaa hum
 Then there should be one lakh temple of Amitabh and not one temple
 tab aap kya karenge
 By then, Amitabh must have become God
 main myth or itihaas ko mila duun to kya banegaa
 Mystery
 myth+history=mistry
 Every company has a story, it is made by knowing every company has a mystery
 ek story hoti he
 The Apple Company story is related to Steve Jobs
 mechadonlds, coca cola in sabaki kii ek kahani he
 Reliance - We know the story of Dhirubhai
 amejon
 This is the story of all of them
 ham har company ke aasapaas ek kahani banaate hai
 The Virgin - The Story of Richard Branson
 keeffsi kii kahani
 Facebook - Mark Zuckerbaum Story
 sirf aswin sanghi hi kahaniyaan nahin banaata
 We all make
 kai baar fiction or fact main antar pataa nahin chalata
 And we all keep making stories between them
 har dharm main alag shaktiyon kii kahani he
 It is the same among Hindus
 yahaan do trikon banate hai
 brahma-vishnu-mahesh on one side and saraswati-lakshmi-durga on one side
 in donon trikon ko jod den to ek chah kone vaala sitara ban jaataa he
 The brahma-vishnu-mahesh triangle runs in business, the same happens in business
 brahma- entrprenyor
 Vishnu- Development and Protection
 jab bijness gadabad hota he tab shiv aate hai
 That is, innovation, renovation, improvement
 starop ke liye saraswati chahie
 Later Lakshmi so as to have resources
 iske baad durga taaki bijness ko sambhala or failaayaa ja sake
 The speed of light was already stated in the Rigveda
 aaj vahiin gati prakaash kii maanak maani jaati he
 Do not understand how one can calculate so accurately sitting in one place so many thousands of years ago
 siio akashganga kii tarah hota he, sabko saath lekar chalata hekisi company kaa siio ke akashganga kii tarah hota he
 Who carries all his employees together
 jaise akashganga ke bich main ek kor hota he jo hajaaron taron ko ekasaath lekar chalata he
 This is what is meant by the swastika symbol
 swaastik ko hameshaa se sabhi ko ekasaath lekar chalane vaala chinh mana gaya he
 Lalu Prasad has told to drink poison in order to make Nitish Kumar the chief ministerial candidate in Bihar
 kya jehar sirf lalu prasad ne hi piya he, nitish kumaar ne nahin
 Hey, Nitish had drunk the same day, forgetting the old rivalry and joined hands with Lalu
 ye baat alag he ki nitish ne aisa koi bayaan nahin diya
 So won't the poison have any effect on Nitish Kumar? How is this possible? Well, after the alliance between RJD and Jedi has found a way for Nitish Kumar to reach the chair again, but there are many challenges
 1
 In Bihar, the hoardings and posters that are still under the election campaign only have a picture of Nitish Kumar
 kisi bhi hording main nitish kumaar or lalu prasad abhi saath najar nahin aa rahe hai
 The Yadav vote bank is already agitated in the name of Nitish and in such a situation how will he vote for Nitish? Lalu was also suffering the same fear, yet under compulsion, he took the cup of poison from lips
 udhar, lalu se chhitak karabijepi main ja milesaansad ram kripal yadav kah rahe hai ki peeth kii maar to log bardaasht kar sakate hai, lekin pet kii laat koi bardaasht nahin kar saktaa he or nitish kumaar ne apane shasankaal main yadavon ke pet par laat maarane kaa kaam kiya he

 kareeb 8 maheene pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi chennai ke daure par the
 Then his meeting with superstar Rajinikanth made headlines and speculation of all the political alliances got air
 ab taliva ne siyaasi raah par chalane kaa elaan kar diya he
 Leader Rajinikanth is in political action and is announcing not only politics but also changing the system in film style
 mana ja rahaa he ki rajnikant raajnneeti main entry se tamilnadu kii siyaasi tevar or calevar badal sakate hai
 Rajinikanth has been praising Modi and is considered pro-modi, his decision to enter politics has raised a ray of hope for BJP in South India
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kiya piem modi ke mishan tamilnadu ke liye rajnikant sanjivani banakar to nahin aae hai
 Rajinikanth announced to enter the last political battle of the year in the name of coming to turmoil in the politics of Tamil Nadu
 tamilnadu kii siyasat main rajnikant ne aise samay main entry kii he, jab jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad se rajya kii raajnneeti main khalipan he
 There is a ruckus in the party over Jayalalithaa's legacy
 unke uttaradhikaar kaa daawa karne vaali shashikala jail main hai
 At such a time, Rajinikanth has entered politics
 unhone daawa kiya ki vah jald hi apni party kaa gathan karenge or sabhi vidhansabha siton par chunaav ladenge
 bjp's eye on the politics of Tamil Nadu BJP does not have a significant support base in the state politics
 iske baavjood bijepi ne rajya main ummiden nahin chodi hai
 In which direction Rajinikanth will take his politics, it is not clear
 lekin bijepi ko ummid he ki rajnikant pradesh kii paramparaagat tarah se hatakar raajnneeti karenge
 In the Dravidian politics of Tamil Nadu, separate Rajinikanth will do spiritual politics, which will be on the lines of saffron politics of BJP
 rajnikant aadhyatmik prakruti ke insaan hai
 Despite the Dravidian culture, Tamil Nadu has a strong land of spirituality which the BJP has never been able to exploit
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki rajnikant apane paksh main ise istemaal karke siyaasi jameen majboot kar sakate hai
 Rajinikanth's political entry is considered to be pro-modi
 unhone kabhi bhi modi ke khilaaf ek bhi shabd nahin bolaa
 Spiritual leaders like Dayanand Saraswati had several years ago asked Rajinikanth to work with the BJP
 iske alaava pradhanmantri narendra modi se lekar rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke pramukh mohan bhagwat tak se kai baar mulaakaat kar chuke hai
 But superstars have always shied away from making their political connections with the BJP openly known
 AIADMK ke liye sankatarajnikant, karunanidhi or jayalalita ke kad ke baraabar kaa cheharaa hai
 His step in politics will have a direct impact, which may harm the ruling AIADMK party
 yahi nahin naa keval vidhansabha chunaav main iskaa asar hoga balki iskaa prabhaav aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main dekhne ko milegaa
 If Rajinikanth even contests elections by forming a separate party, then BJP will get its direct benefit
 tamilnadu kii siyasat main ediemke ke paas jayalalita ke baad or diemke main koi bhi aisa netaa nahin he jo apane dam par chunaav jeeta sake
 The scope of leaders like OPS, EPS and Dinakaran are limited
 dramuk kii bagdor stallin ke haathon main he, pichley do chunaavon unke netritv main lade gaye lekin party ko jeet nahin dilaa sake hai
 In such a situation, his party will benefit from Rajinikanth's superstar image
 haalanki, abhi rajnikant kii siyaasi tasviir bahut saaf nahin he ki wo aage kaise badhayenge or kinake sahare aage badhenge

 jaishankar or thakor ko bhaajapa ke 100 vidhayakon ke alaava rakanpa ke ek vidhayak, bhartiya trybal party ke do or congress ke do asantusht vidhayakon alpesh thakor or jaala ke vot mili hai
 Soon after the voting, Alpesh Thakor and Jala resigned as Congress mlas
 congress ne chunaav ayog se alpesh or jaala ke maton ko radd karne ko kaha kyonki unhone vip kii avhelnaa karte hue party ke ummidavaar ke khilaaf matdaan kiya he
 But before the counting of votes began, the Election Commission rejected his application
 chunki donon siton ke liye matdaan alag alag hue hai isliye prayek ummidavaar ko jeetne ke liye 50 pratishat vot chahie
 Jaishankar has thanked the central and state leadership of the BJP for his victory
 unhone kaha ki videsh mantralay kaa gujarat kii janata ke saath vishesh sambandh hai kyonki is rajya ke log badi sankhya main videshon main based hai
 Now i want to increase contact with the people of the state by becoming a representative from Gujarat

 He has also held Nehru responsible for this
 unhone blog main bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki jammu-kashmir ke sambandh main nehru ke drushtikon thik nahin the
 Now the time has come for us to stop the journey from special status to separation

 Due to this, investment and employment generation has stopped in the state and the people of the state are suffering due to this
 'kendriya mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki anuchhed 35-e ko kisi samvidhan sanshodhan ke jariye nahin laayaa gaya tha

 com / 456ytadpqe — Chowkidar Arun Jaitley (@arunjaitley) March 28, 2019 Union Minister Arun Jaitley said that the situation in Jammu and Kashmir raises many questions in the last seven decades
 kya nehru kii niti itihaas kii sabase badi bhul thi yaa unka sahi kadam tha jiskaa baad main anusaran kiya gaya
 Most Indians believe that Nehru's attitude is responsible for this
 kya desh kii niti ko puraane dharre par chalanaa hoga yaa hamen vaastavik yathasthiti ke hisaab se talmail bithaana hoga
 Union Minister Arun Jaitley has also described how Article 35-A harms the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha, 'rajya ke paas paryaapt aarthik sansaadhan nahin hai
 If we insist on increasing it, then Article 35-A is a hindrance
 koi bhi niveshak rajya main industry, hotel, privet shikshan santhaan, yaa privet aspataal nahin sthapit karnaa chahta
 The reason behind this is that neither many can buy land here nor can do such work with any of their caretakers
 unke bachche ko yahaan na sarkari naukari mil sakati he na hi kisi shikshan sanstha main pravesh mil saktaa he
 In today's era, no major national or international level institution is able to invest in the field of tourism, whereas there is plenty of resources
 aisi vajahen rajya kii samruddhi, sansaadhan or rojgaar srijan rokatii hai
 'union Minister Arun Jaitley said,' Students have to travel all over the country
 yahaan ke vidhyaarthee nepal or bangladesh jate hai jisase unhen collejon main daakhila mil sake
 Engineering colleges, hospitals and rich resources are lying in Jammu which are not being used because professors and doctors do not want to go there
 anuchhed 35-e ne rajya kii arthvyastha ko barbaad kar diya he
 'union Minister Arun Jaitley said terrorism is now ending
 aatankwaad or algaavvaad ko badhaane vaali sansthaaon ko bain kiya ja rahaa he
 The Union Minister praised the present Central Government and said that the terrorists were killed during this period
 do mukhya raajnneetik partiyaan keval tivi channelon ko bite de rahi hai
 His work is limited to social media
 ab jammu or kashmir kii janata centre sarkaar ke pahal kaa swaagat kar rahe hai
 They want peace, freedom from terror and violence
 kendriya mantri ne arun jetali ne aatankwaad kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki aatankwaad kaa ab khaatmaa ho rahaa he
 Institutions that promote terrorism and separatism are being banned
 kendriya mantri ne maujuuda centre sarkaar kii tarif karte hue kaha ki is dauraan aatankiyon ko maaraa gaya
 The two main political parties are only giving bytes to TV channels
 unka kaam soshal media tak hi simit he
 Now the people of Jammu and Kashmir are welcoming the initiative of the Central Government

 shiv ling ko shiv ji kaa niraakaar swarup mana jaataa he
 It is most recognized in Shiva worship
 shivlinga main shiv or shakti donon hi samahit hote hai
 Worshiping both of them becomes complete by worshiping Shivalinga
 vibhinn prakaar ke shiv lingon kii puja karne kaa praavdhaan he jaise- swayambhu shivlinga, narmadeshwar shivlinga, janeudhari shivlinga, sone or chaandi ke shivlinga or paarad shivlinga
 The worship of Swayambhu Shivling is most important and also fruitful
 shivlinga kii mahatvapurn baaten kya hai or kya he isaki sthapana ke niyam?shivlinga kii puja upasna shiv puja main sabase zyada mahatvapurn hoti hai
 Shivalinga is installed differently in the house and differently in the temple
 shivlinga kahin bhi sthapit ho par uski vedi kaa mukh uttar disha kii taraf hi hona chahie
 The lingam installed in the house should not be too big, it should be at least 6 inches
 mandir main kitna bhi bada shivlinga sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 In order to achieve special purposes and wishes, he is worshiped by making earthly Shivling
 shivlinga kii puja main kya kya arpit karnaa chahie?shivaji kii puja main do vastuon kaa vishesh mahatv he- jal or belptr
 Both these things can be duly worshiped to Shiva
 iske alaava kaccha doodh, sugandh, ganne kaa ras , chandan se bhi shiv ji kaa abhishek kiya jaataa he
 Shiva should never offer semal, juhi, kadamb and ketaki
 shivlinga par kuch bhi arpit karte samay kin baton kaa khyaal rakhkhen?shiv ling par jaleey padaarth arpit karte samay uski dhara banaakar arpit karnaa chahie
 While offering solid material, apply it to the Shivling with both hands
 shiv ling par kuch bhi arpit karen, ant main jal jarur arpit karen
 You should not offer vengeful things on Shiva Linga, as well as use Maran
 kya he vishesh mantrashiv ling par koi bhi dravya arpit karte samay nimna mantra kahen -" namah shambhvaay c, mayobhavaay c , namah shankarai c , mayskaraay c, namah shivaay c, shivatraay c" Cricketer Moe Shami's wife's dress on social media and Saif and Kareena's name of their newborn Timur have sparked a huge debate on social media

 bhartiya pradhanmantri narendra modi china kii taraf dosti kaa haath badhanaa chaahate hai
 But what can a 'dragon' with a history of deceit be trusted? Understand this from the fact that while the Prime Minister is visiting China, the government channel there is showing the wrong map of India
 china ke sarkari broadcaster china central televijan (sisitivi) ne bharat kaa jo nakshaa dikhaaya he, usamen jammu-kashmir or arunachal pradesh gaayab he
 Both the states have not been considered part of India
 jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri or neshnal conference ke netaa umr abdulla ne bhi chini tivi ke screenshot ko retweet kiya
 This is the Map of India that China's CCTV showed to its viewers while # modiinchina

 India has a long-standing border dispute with China
 china arunachal pradesh ko bharat kaa hissaa nahin maanata
 At the same time, its stand on Kashmir has also been more in favor of Pakistan
 aise main modi kii yatra ke dauraan china main galat nakshe kaa prasaaran bharat ke rashtravaadiyon ko apni hi sarkaar se naaraaz kar saktaa he

 Actually, the MP of Hajipur parliamentary constituency Pashupati Paras has been out of his parliamentary constituency for the last several days and the people there are very angry about this
 apni naaraazgi ko darshane ke liye hajipur kii janata ne ek nayaa tarika nikaala he

 gauratlab he, pashupati paras lok shakti party ke rashtriya adhyaksh or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ke chote bhai hai
 Ram Vilas Paswan was being elected as an MP from Hajipur for the past several times, but this time he decided not to contest
 jiske baad chote bhai pashupati paras ko party ne ummidavaar banaaya or vah chunaav jeet gaye
 The people of the area are complaining that Pashupati Paras has been continuously missing from his parliamentary constituency since winning the election and the miseries of the public are not joining the pain
 janata kaa kahana he ki chunaav jeetne ke baad shaayad hi ek yaa do baar pashupati paras ne hajipur kaa daura kiya ho
 The people of Hajipur also complain that Pashupati Paras do not attend any of the events held there

 In this case, Purohit has actively participated in the conspiracy meetings
 vah visphot main istemaal karne ke liye visphot kaa intjaam karne ke liye raji ho gaye the
 However, Purohit refused

 The Niyamgiri mountain range of Odisha, which has preserved India's oldest forests, has now become a battleground
 isamen ek ore, odisha ke kalahandi or raigadha jilon main sthit is parvat shrunkhlaa main prakritik sampada kaa dohan karke rajya kaa rajasav or rojgaar badhaane ke pairokaar hai to duusari ore dongariyaa kaundh adivasee hai, jinka astitv niyamagiri par nirbhar he
 This mountain is their everything for them
 adivaasiyon ko lagata he ki khanan se unke ilaake ko nuksaan hoga
 The Supreme Court banned mining of bauxite from the Niyamgiri mountain three years ago due to strong opposition from the tribals of Dongria Kaund caste
 lekin odisha mins korporation limited (oemasiel) ne ab supreme court main punarvichaar yachika daayar kar di he
 In this petition, the court has been demanded to once again order public hearings in the gram sabhas and ensure the participation of the local people in the mining work
 bataaya jaataa he ki niyamagiri khanan main nijee khanan company vedanta ko khaas dilchaspee he kyonki isse lanjigarh prakhand sthit uski sahaayak company sterlite kii aluminium rifinary chal niklegi or use kaccha maal sahajata se uplabdh hone lagegaa
 Although according to the new rules, the ownership will remain with OMCL but a maximum of 30% shares can be given to the private sector
 yahi nahin, oemasiel ne van mantralay ko bataaya he ki vah akele khanan karegi
 Not only this, the Odisha government also canceled a joint venture with Vedanta last year
 vedanta or sterlite anil agarwal kii companiyaan hai
 Sterlite bought the profit-making public sector Bharat Aluminum Company (balco) in Korba, Chhattisgarh in 2001
 yah saarvajanik kshetra kii munafa kamaane vaali aisi pehali company thi, jiskaa vinievesh kiya gaya tha
 This decision was strongly opposed by the local people
 lekin centre kii tatkaaleen endie sarkaar ne chhattisgarh kii congress sarkaar ke virodh ke baavjood baalko kaa vinievesh kar diya tha
 The aluminum refinery in Lanjigarh block of Kalahandi also belongs to this company
 haalanki vedanta ke ek varisht adhikari kehete hai, ''ab oemasiel se hamaari company kaa koi samjhauta nahin he
 The petition has been filed by OMCL and we are not in the complete picture
 vaise bhi nae niyamon ke tahat nijee companiyon kii share holding nammaatr he, aise main malikana haq nijee companiyon kaa nahin rahegaa
 Vedanta and omcl's shared bauxite mining project suffered a setback three years ago due to opposition from local tribals
 supreme court ke aadesh par rajya sarkaar kii ore se chuni gai niyamagiri par basii 12 palli sabhaaon (gram panchayaton) ko kaha gaya tha ki ve jila jaj kii maujuudagi main 2013 main july se agast ke bich jansunwaayee ke madhyam se pariyojna ke paksh yaa vipaksh main nirnay len, jise lagu kiya jayega
 All parli meetings were in opposition to the Niyamgiri excavation project
 natijatan utkhanan kaa kaam aage nahin bad sakaa
 Now three years later, after much deliberation, OMCL has filed a review petition
 is vivaad kii shuruyaat 1997 main hui jab oemasiel or vedanta aluminium limited ke bich ek saajha upkram par sahmati bani
 Under this, the work of extracting bauxite was to be done by digging Niyamgiri and Khambasi hills
 niyamagiri ke adivaasiyon kii ladaai ke agua samaajawaadee janparishad ke sachiv lingraj aaazaad kehete hai, ''swatantra bharat ke itihaas main sambhawatah yah pehla mauka he, jab adivaasiyon ko apane astitv kii ladaai main itani badi kamyaabi mili
 Seven parish meetings from Kalahandi and five from Rayagada were attended in this public hearing
 ''dongariyaa kaundh un virali janajatiyon main se ek he, jinhen sabase aadim mana jaataa he
 Their population is now about 10,000
 vikaas kii mukhya dhara se dur yah janajati odisha ke kalahandi or raigadha ke ilaake main niyamagiri pahari par basii hui he
 Niyamgiri is everything for this tribe, completely dependent on forests for its survival, from the resources of living to their cultural rituals and prayers of salvation
 adivasee samudaay niyamagiri ko apana isht or yahaan kaa raja maanata he
 But these innocent tribals do not know that under the Niyamgiri mountain that has given them shelter, millions of tons of bauxite have been pressed under it, which may not have any value for them, but the government and private sector companies know its value
 is
 is khanij par sarkari kshetra kii company oemasiel kii bhi najar thi
 Therefore, OMCL filed a review petition on 25 February
 vastav main niyamagiri main adivaasiyon ke hiton ko dhyaan main rakhkar jo faisla hua tha vah kisi kranti se kam nahin tha
 This can be called a major success of the Forest Rights Act, 2006, which has protected the rights of tribals and other forest dwellers
 firangi hukumat ke samay van kanoon ke badale laae gaye is kanoon ke aadhaar par sunaaya gaya yah pehla faisla he, jisane jangal or adivaasiyon kii aajeevika ko sangrakshit kiya he
 Siddharth Nayak, president of an organization called Green Kalahandi, says, "omc's reconsideration petition will be opposed
" adivaasiyon ko ujaadkar boxite khanan kisi bhi keemat par nahin hone denge
 Development cannot happen unilaterally and arbitrarily
 ''ek mahatvapurn sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki jab boxite or loha jaise keemtee khanij padaarth dharti main dabe pade hai, to unka dohan kyon nahin hona chahie? darasal, beete 66 varshon ke itihaas par najar daali jaae to anubhav yahi kahata he ki jin bhi kshetron main khanan hua yaa jahaan badi pariyojnaayen banaai gayi unka phayda vahaan ke mul nivaasiyon ko nahin mila
 Even the local people did not get their rights
 varanaa aisa kaise ho saktaa tha ki aazaadee milane ke turant baad desh ke nakshe par ubhare do sabase bade jile odisha kaa koraput (jo ab raigadha or kalahandi sahit paanch jilon main vibhajit he) or chhattisgarh kaa bastar (jo ab saat jilon main vibhajit he) akut prakritik sampada hone ke baavjood aaj bhi sabase garib or pichde jilon main gine jate
 The government of Odisha has consulted the legalists to prepare a review petition
 isamen nae van kanoon ke mutabik, adivaasiyon ke moulik adhikaron masalan, swasthya or shiksha aadi kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhane kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 However, the tribal community has mobilized against it
 niyamagiri suraksha manch ke raghu pujari kehete hai, ''niyamagiri dongariyaa kaundh logon ke devtaa hai
 The mining work here will not be allowed at all
 '' apane virodh ke paksh main niyamagiri suraksha samiti ke log ateet kii ghatana kaa zikr karte hue bataate hai ki aisi hi ek pariyojna ke liye kis tarah kinary gaanv ke 35 gharon par bulldozer chalaa diya gaya tha or purushon tathaa mahilaon ko berahami se banduukon ke bat se peeta gaya tha
 One aspect of the concern of local people about mining is that when the mining company starts working here, the water of local rivers will become polluted
 pani ke adhikadhik dohan se tel jaisi nadiyon ke sookhne kaa khatra to paidaa hoga hi, ek anumaan ke mutabik,kaarkaane se har saal lagbhag bees lakh ton apshisht nikalegaa jisase nagavalli or vanshadhara nadiyon kaa pani vishakt ho jayega
 And if the flow of these rivers stop, then 580 villages along its banks will be hit by water pollution and their life may be in danger
 in khataron se waakif adivasee samudaay ne phir bhi 26 se 28 march tak niyamagiri raja kii puja archana kaa tyohaar badi dhoomdhaam se manaaya
 Currently, omcl's petition is pending for hearing in a three-member bench of the Supreme Court

 somvaar ko bina kisi jaankaree ke centre sarkaar rajyasabha main jammu kashmir riorgenigeshan bill 2019 lekar ai
 Under this, Jammu and Kashmir is divided into two union territories, Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh
 aaj is bill par loksabhaa main charchaa jari he
 There is currently President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir, so passing such a bill in Parliament without "state Government's opinion" under Article 3 of the Constitution raises many questions on this whole development
 bill main kya he?jammu kashmir rajya ko do centre shasit pradeshon main tabdeel kar diya jayega
 Jammu and Kashmir will have an assembly like Delhi and Pondicherry, while Ladakh will not have a legislature
 donon centre shasit pradeshon ko ek leftinent governor head karenge
 Apart from the general rights, LG will have the right to use 'discretion' in the affairs of the All India Services and anti-corruption Bureau
 inhen masalon par dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar or centre ke bich lagaataar anban hoti rahi he
 Like other states, the tenure of the Legislative Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir Union Territory has been reduced to 5 years, earlier it was 6 years
 upree sadan vidhaan parishad kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he ise bhang kar diya gaya he
 Elections will be held for 107 seats through direct election
 kul siton kii sankhya main 7 siton kii badhottaree hogi
 Interestingly, 24 seats have been left for Pakistan Occupied Kashmir when it will be liberated from the occupation of Pakistan
 chunaavon ke sanvaidhanik adhikaron se jude anuchhed 324 se 327 or 329 jisamen vidhansabha kshetron kaa dilimitesan shaamil he, in centre shasit pradeshon par bhi lagu hoga
 106 Union Laws will be implemented on the Union Territories, some of which will be fully implemented and some will also have restrictions
 inamen pramukh kanoon, artiai, aadhaar, nyochit bhatte kaa adhikaar or bhoomi adhigrahan jaise kanoon shaamil hai
 Several criminal laws like IPC, NSA, anti-corruption Law, SC ST Act, POSCO, Benami Property Law and Dowry Prevention Act will also apply
 kai dharmik kanoon jaise hindu vivaag act, hindu vaaris act, muslim vivaah viched kanoon, muslim mahila act ( teen talaak) or neshnal kamishan for minurities bhi lagu kiya jayega
 Major changes have been made in the law related to property
 nae bill main transfar of property act 1977 (1) ke section 139 or 140 ko chhod diya gaya he iske tahat ab kashmir ke gaiyr sthai nivasee ko bhi sampatti bechi ja sakati he
 Waqf and enemy property laws will also be implemented
 rajya dwaara paarit 7 kanoonon ko badlaav ke saath centre shasit pradesh main lagu kiya jayega 
 In addition, the state's 153 laws and the Governor's Act will be repealed
 is bill raashtrapati ko ye adhikaar detaa he ki wo jab tak uchit samajhen vidhansabha ko bhang, suspend yaa barkhaast kar sakate hai
 This can be done by taking cognizance of the report itself or on LG
 jammu kashmir hoicourt donon centre shasit pradeshon ke liye kaaman hogi
 The bill also provides for the formation of committees for property sharing, rights and liabilities between the two
 saath hi yaheen adwijuri cametiyaan jal or bijli kaa bhi bantwaaraa karengi
 Why the change was done The reason for this partition has been attributed to the internal situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 centre ke mutabik seemaa paar aatankwaad, maujuuda suraksha vyavastha or rajya main aatankwaad ke halaat ko dekhte hue ye faisla liya gaya he
 The bill for Ladakh states that the public has been demanding for a long time to make Ladakh a separate union territory, which has been fulfilled
 Why is the bill questioned? This bill has also given rise to many concerns
 bill ko padhane se pataa lagata he ki ye jaldbaaji main taiyaar kiya he jisamen kai badlaav to kiye gaye hai lekin 103 upaniyamon ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin di gai he
 Altogether 106 central laws and 7 laws of the state have been given to the union territory with changes
 vahiin 153 rajya kanoon or governor act ko nirast kar diya gaya he
 Detailed information about these changes is not available at the moment
 doosraa, rajyasabha kii kaarywahi ke mutabik is bill ko saansadon ko padhane ke liye pehle se nahin diya gaya
 The copy of the bill was put on the Rajya Sabha website in the evening
 samvidhan ke jaankaar or loksabhaa ke purv secretary general pediti aachaari ne is bill par kai or chintaaen jaahir kii hai
 According to Pachari, Article 356 and Article 3 of the Constitution clearly explain the rights
 anuchhed 356 sansad ko ye adhikaar detaa he ki wo rajya ke adhikaron kaa istemaal kare yani rajya ke adhikaar jaise kanoon paas karnaa aadi
 But Article 3 clearly states that the decisions of the state legislature should be taken in decisions like creating new states, fixing the state boundaries and changing the name of the state, and the public opinion comes only by the legislature and these rights are not to the Parliament Can be assigned
 isliye is bill main rajya kii raay raashtrapati ko milani chahie thi
 Not only this, Achari also says that Article 3 does not say that a state should be converted into a union territory
 ye ek abhootpurv kadam he or iske nattejey bhi ulate ho sakate hai

 There is still some time in the Bihar Legislative Assembly elections
 usase pehle vidhaan parishad kii 24 siton ke liye chunaav hone vaale hai
 In this election too, there will be competition between two alliances
 kaaryakartaaon kii chunautiyanpahale nitish or lalu ne haath milaayaa
 Then Lalu also drank poison
 ab dilon kii dooriyaan mitin yaa nahin ye na to maaloom he or na siyasat main myne rakhti he
 Is the same with local leaders and activists? Probably not
 kaaryakartaaon ke liye 20 saal morch par ek duusare ke khilaaf date rahanaa or ab sari baaten bhul kar saath dena bahut mushkil hoga
 This is the biggest challenge of the alliance
 aisi chunautiyon se congress ke mukaable argedy or jediu ko kahin adhik jujhna he
 It will not be impossible to unite the workers till the booth level, to make friendships in place of enmity and to motivate them to work whole heartedly

 From the first teaser of Anushka Sharma's film Phillauri, people are very excited about it
 bollywood ne bade-bade sitaron ne anoushka kii is film ke trailor kii kaaphi tarif kii, jisase anoushka kaaphi khush thim, lekin is film se judi ek khabar ne anoushka ko kaaphi pareshaan kar diya he
 Actually, a few days after the first trailer of this film, there was news that his boyfriend and cricketer Virat Kohli has invested money in this film of Anushka Sharma
 haalanki anoushka sharma is khabar kaa khandan kar chuki hai lekin aisi khabaron ke saamne aane se anoushka pareshaan to nahin hai lekin isse kaaphi chakit jarur hai
 This is to say that the director of this film, Anshai Lal, said this in an interview given to news agency PTI
 tippaniyan Anshai told PTI, 'I don't think she is upset by it
 mujhe lagata he ki vah bahut zyada chakit he ki aakhir aisi kahaniyaan kaise baahar aati hai
 She has said what she had to say and we are with her
 yah kaaphi ghatiya or gaiyr jimmedaara he ki is tarah kii khabaren saamne aati hai
 ' haalanki jab unase yah jaanane kii koshish kii gai ki kya viraat film 'filori' ke set par aae to anshai ne is vishay par kuch bhi kehane se manaa kar diya
 Let us tell you that there were some such reports in the beginning of February, the production of this film of Anushka Sharma is actually being done by Virat Kohli and Anushka denied this, writing, 'this kind of false and unproven facts based news source You have not only insulted my dignity by imprinting it, but i have insulted all those who are working in this film

 Prior to this, she had produced the film 'NH10' in the year 2015
 anshai ne pitiai ko bataaya, ' mujhe nahin lagata ki vah isse pareshaan he
 i think he is very surprised how such stories come out
 unhen jo kahana tha vah kah chuki hai or ham unke saath hai
 It is lousy and irresponsible that such news comes out
 ' However, when he tried to know if Virat came on the set of the film 'phillauri', Anshai refused to say anything on the subject
 bataa den ki farvari kii shuruyaat main kuch aisi khabaren ai thim anoushka sharma kii is film kaa production darasal viraat kohli kar rahe hai or anoushka ne is baat kaa khandan karte hue likh, ' is tarah kii juthi or bina tathyon par aadhaarit khabaron ko sorce ke hawaale se chhap kar aap logon na keval meri mahanat kaa apmaan kiya he jisaki badolat main yahaan hum, balki un sab kaa bhi apmaan kiya he jo is film main kaam kar rahe hai

 Raman Singh, who has held the chief minister's chair for nine years in tribal-dominated Chhattisgarh, had a very relaxed day on July 9, 2012
 yah taarikh unki teesri pari kii taiyaari main majboot neenv sabit ho sakati he
 Regardless of his and the opposition, Singh increased the quota of tribes to 12 per cent by reducing the Scheduled Caste quota by four per cent in government jobs and educational institutions
 is par bilaspur hycourt ne roak laga di thi, lekin sarkaar kii daleel ke baad adaalat ne ab roak hataakar 58 fisadi aarakshan par amal ke liye rasta khol diya he

 On 18 January this year, the government issued a notification amending the reservation policy, and on 16 March the Assembly passed the Reservation Act for Scheduled Tribes, Castes and Other Backward Classes - 2012
 is kanoon ke mutabik, anusuchit janajati (asti) kaa aarakshan 20 se badhaakar 32 fisadi kar diya gaya
 But the Scheduled Caste (SC) quota was reduced from 16 to 12 per cent, while there was no tampering of the 14 per cent reservation quota for the Other Backward Classes
 iske khilaaf guru ghasidas sahitya evam samskruti academy ne hycourt main yachika lagaai thi
 On April 13, the High Court's ban on this law caused the Raman government to breathe, as the old law was over and all new recruits would have to be made in a normal manner by a ban on the new law
 isi daleel ke baad court ne antarim aadesh ke tahat roak hataa lee
 Feeling relieved, the Chief Minister told India Today, "reservation has been fixed according to the population of castes, for which the Legislative Assembly has enacted a law
 hamaari yah raay nyaayalay ko uchit lagi
 "but politics has intensified on the issue of reducing SC quota
" purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi kehete hai, ''janajatiyon kaa kota badhanaa acchhee pahal he, lekin ham essi kaa kota ghataane kaa virodh karte hai
 If the government had to cross the 50 per cent limit, it would have been 58 per cent instead of 58 per cent
 essi kaa kota kam karnaa or obisi kaa kota nahin badhanaa galat he
 This will certainly be an election issue of ours
 ''lekin jogi ke etraj par palatwaar karte hue raman singh kehete hai, ''jogi ko etraj he to pehle apni centre sarkaar ko sahamat kara len
 The Center had issued the notification five years ago, which based on 2001 census, there was a reservation of 32 per cent for ST, 12 for SC and 6 per cent for OBC

 Harbhajan Singh and r Ashwin are looking to get two off-spin bowlers a place in the playing 11 of the Fatullah Test
 ye daunon vaise to hameshaa hi ek jagah ke liye ek-duusare ko chunauti dete aae hai, lekin is baar donon ko milakar jeet kii kahani likhni hogi
 There are two strong reasons for the two to be together in Playing 11
 fatullah ke stadium kii pich spinners ko raas aati he
 Here in the 2005 single-handed test, 24 of 37 wickets were taken by the spinners
 doosraa bangladesh kii team main baayen ke ballebaaz zyada hai, jisase of spinner kaa role ahm ho jaataa he
 Bhajji and Ashwin have not played much together, but for Team India, this pair can prove to be fatal on the pitches of the subcontinent
 tippaniyan The two have played three Test matches together, winning India in two of them
 november 2012 main mumbai test main donon ne milakar 4 wicket jatke the, do-do donon ke naam rahe the
 Together, they took 15 wickets in the Chennai Test in February 2013, of which 12 wickets were from Ashwin

 Ashwin, who has flopped abroad, has to prove that he is equally deadly and aggressive in big format
 in donon ke boote team india ko kareeb dedh saal ke baad koi test series jeetne kaa bharosa he
 These two races have always challenged each other for a place, but this time they both have to write the story of victory together
 donon ke ek saath plaing 11 main hone ke do majboot kaaran nazar aate hai
 The pitch of Fatullah Stadium appeals to the spinners
 yahaan par 2005 main hue eklaute test main 37 main se 24 wicket spinners ne hi nikaale the
 Second Bangladesh team has more left batsmen, which makes the role of off-spinner important
 bhajji or aswin kii jodi bahut zyada to ek saath nahin kheli he, lekin team india ke liye ye jodi upmahadweep kii pichon par ghaatak sabit ho sakati he
 The comments donon ne teen test match ek saath khele hai, jisamen se do main bharat ko jeet mili
 In November 2012, in Mumbai Test, both together took 4 wickets, two each were named
 farvari 2013 main chennai test main milakar donon ne 15 wicket nikaale, jisamen se 12 wicket aswin ke the
 The pair took 8 wickets in the Hyderabad Test in March 2013, of which six wickets were in Ashwin's name
 in donon ke saath khilne se team menagement ko bharosa he ki donon kaa khel nikharegaa or team ko phayda hoga
 Where Bhajji will have to bowl unscathed from the shadow of his past
 vahiin videsh main flop rahane vaale aswin ko sabit karnaa he ki vah bade formet main bhi utane hi ghaatak or aakraamak hai
 Due to these two, Team India is confident of winning a Test series after about one and a half years

 There are 41 policemen from Assistant Sub Inspector to DCP rank who investigated the Nirbhaya case one day and night and arrested the accused and brought them to the gallows
 inaki jaanch kii tarif nichali adaalat, hycourt or supreme court teenon ne apane apane faislon main kii
 On Monday, Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik called them Delhi Police Headquarters and encouraged them
 wo 16 disambar 2012 kii raat thi jab nirbhaya ke saath ek chalati bas main gangrape hua tha
 6 people with him made such havoc that he died during treatment on 29 December
 is maamle main police ne ek hafte ke andar na sirf sabhi aropiyon ko pakad liya balki mahaz 19 din ke andar court main 1000 pannon kii chargeshit bhi pesh kar di
 The comments is cese main aisa koi saboot, aisa koi gavaah nahin tha jise police ne apni jaanch main shaamil na kiya ho
 The police recovered the cctv footage of the accused as well as the route through which they were settled
 aropiyon ke paas se peedit kaa mobile phone, unke atm card, sone kii chen or doosraa saamaan baraamad kiya
 DNA test of the accused and the victim, which also matched, was done, forensic examination of tooth bites, statements of more than 50 witnesses were recorded
 yahi nahin, jaanch main us har chote se chote bindu ko shaamil kiya gaya jo aropiyon ko court main khadaa kar saktaa tha
 The police got Nirbhaya's parents' passport to take them to Singapore within a day, from Sarojini Nagar Market to shopping for them
 team main 2 disipi ke alaava kai tejatarraar inspector or sab inspector shaamil rahe
 Apart from this, dozens of soldiers were also involved in the investigation of the case day and night
 police adhikari lagaataar nirbhaya ke maa baap ko dhiraj bandhaate rahe, shaayad yahi vajah he ki cese kii shuruyaat se lekar court ke faisle aane tak nirbhaya ke maa baap police kii tarif karte rahe
 In this case there was no such evidence, no witness that the police did not include in its investigation
 police ne aropiyon ke pakadaney ke saath-saath jis raste se bas gai thi uskaa cctv footage baraamad kiya
 The victim's mobile phone, ATM card, gold chain and other belongings were recovered from the accused
 aropiyon or peedit kii diene jaanch karai jiskaa milan bhi sahi hua, daanton ke kaatane ke nishaan kii forensik jaanch karai gai, 50 se zyada gavaahon ke bayaan darj karaae gaye
 Not only this, the investigation covered every small point that could make the accused stand in the court
 police ne mahaz ek din ke andar singapore le jane ke liye nirbhaya ke maa-baap kaa passport banwaaya, sarojini nagar market se unke liye shopping tak kii
 Besides the 2 dcps in the team, there were several high profile inspectors and sub-inspectors
 iske alaava darjanon sipaahi bhi raat din maamle kii jaanch se jude rahe
 Police officers continued to be patient with Nirbhaya's parents, which is probably why Nirbhaya's parents continued to praise the police from the beginning of the case until the court's verdict

 kehete hai dushman kaa dushman dost hota he or board kii maujuuda raajnneeti ko dekhte hue ye jumala sahi bhi nazar aa rahaa he, But it is certain that Shashank Manohar has benefited in this entire manipulation and N
 Srinivasan has suffered
 jharkhand ke kuch jilon ke gramin ilaakon main in dinon janata karfu laga he
 In these areas, people have stopped the arrival of outsiders and government personnel by putting up boards
 itnaa hi nahin graminon ne board main dhara 244 (1) kaa ullekh karte hue likhaa he ki bina gram sabha ke anumati ke kisi bhi sarkari / gaiyr sarkari karmchaaree / padaadhikari kaa pravesh varjit he
 Actually, the villagers are unhappy with not getting on the ground of government schemes
 duusari taraf udyogon ke jameen ke vaaste dalal bhole-bhaale graminon ko phuslaa kar aane-paune daamon main jameen kaa sauda karne main lage hai
 Police patrolling was increased
 Look at this board located outside the boundary of a village in Gumla district of Jharkhand
 isamen saafe shabdon main chetavanee di gai he ki bina gram sabha kii anumati ke sarkari yaa gaiyr sarkari karmchaariyon kaa pravesh nishedh he
 Actually, the reason for the resentment of the villagers is the land brokers, who are tricking the tribals for land
 yahi haal khunti jile kaa bhi he jahaan graminon ne isi aashay kaa board laga rakhaa he
 Here, the villagers had also held the police officers hostage for some time
 khunti ke bhandra panchayat, siladon panchayat, kanki, hesahatu, gutuva, landup, murahi panchayat, dokaad, chamadi, chikor, tilma samet kareeb 42 aise panchayat hai, jahaan aise board graminon ne lagaae hai
 In such a situation, the situation is so tense that police patrolling has been increased here
 patthalgadi kii aad main sajishempulice ke aalaa adhikari is sambandh main kuch or hi daleelein pesh karte hai
 He says that the areas where such boards have been installed are very remote, Naxalites and other anti-social elements are engaged in cultivation of opium in these places
 aise main inhone patthalgadi kaa sahaara liya he
 At the same time, the villagers also support them because of the profits from opium
 vahiin, ilaake ke vidhayak jharkhand ke gramin vikaas mantri nilkanth singh munda kaa kahana he ki patthalgadi darasal ek pracheen parampara he, lekin in dinon kuch shararti tatv bhole bhaale graminon ko bargala kar sarkaar virdohi dushprachaar main jute hai
 What is Patthalgadi? Patthalgadi is an ancient tradition of tribals
 isamen pathar gaad kar ilaake ko pratibandhit kshetra ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 Without the permission of Gram Sabha, entry of any other person is not prohibited here
 vaise jharkhand ke alaava chhattisgarh, odisha, madhya pradesh, maharashtra aadi rajyon main bhi patthalgadi adivasee karte aa rahe hai, lekin jharkhand main kufia vibhaag bhi maananaa he kipatthalgadiki aad main sajishein rachi ja rahi hai
 However, the village head of the area has been arrested in connection with taking police officers hostage in Khunti
 maharashtra ke siyaasi ghamaasan main MNS kii entrimanse netaa sandip deshpandey ne ksaa tangajit pavaar ke nirnay ko lekar saadhaa nishanamaharashtra kii raajnneeti lagaataar karavat le rahi he
 The ncp-congress and Shiv Sena come together to attack the Bharatiya Janata Party
 ab is raajnneetik bayaanbaji main raaj thakare kii party maharashtra navnirmaan sena (manase) bhi kud gai he
 MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande tweeted on Monday in this matter and took a dig at the opposition parties
 sandip deshpandey ne twit kiya, ‘jinhen abhi bhi lagata he ki ye sirf ajit pavaar kaa nirnay he, unhen baldivas kii shubhakamanaayen’
 Sandeep Deshpande has done this tweet in Marathi language

 com / kcatmfcy6r— Sandeep Deshpande (@sandeepdadarmns)november 25, 2019gauratlab he ki manase abhi tak is maamle main puri tarah se shant thi, lekin ab manase netaa ne jis tarah ye twit kiya he use ek tarah se tanj mana ja rahaa he
 However, it is difficult to say where the target is being shot
 sandip deshpandey ne beete dinon hi ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ke saath apni tasviir saajha kii thi
 With whom is Ajit Pawar? It is worth mentioning that Ajit Pawar formed the government with the Bharatiya Janata Party by claiming the support letter of NCP mlas
 ajit pavaar rajya ke upmukhyamantri ban gaye hai lekin ensipi kaa kahana he ki ye ajit pavaar kaa nijee faisla he party kaa faisla nahin he
 Most of the mlas who were with Ajit Pawar are now seen in Sharad Pawar's court
 ensipi netaa nawab malik kaa daawa he ki 54 main se 53 vidhayak waapas unke paale main aa gaye hai or vah jald hi rajyapal se mulaakaat bhi kar sakate hai
 Hearing to be held in Supreme Court, on the petition of Shiv sena-congress and NCP, this matter has reached the court, Supreme Court can give verdict on this matter today
 aise main adaalat kya floor test kaa aadesh detii he yaa phir koi or aadesh diya jaataa he isapar har kisi kii nazar he
 The times have changed and women are also changing themselves
 lekin mahilaon ko lekar ab bhi kai purushon ke vichaar madhyayugin samaaj jaise hi hai
 They want to see women in a molded mold
 zyaadaatar purushon ko yah pasand nahin ki mahilaayein puraane daayaron ko toden
 Extreme maleists consider it a threat to themselves
 iske peeche badi vajah sadiyon se chali aa rahi vah soch he, jo mahilaon ko kamatar karke dekhati he
 Men also have a special view of marriage
 mahilaon ko lekar unka khaas najariya hota he
 They are told and taught about the weakness of women
 bachapan kii yahi sikh bhavishya kii soch kaa aadhaar banati he
 They carry many biases about women, which are very different from reality
 mahilaon ko lekar aam purushon kii jo dhaaran he, vah kaaphi had tak ruudhivaadee he
 Women are far ahead of this ideology
 isliye jarurat he ki mugalate todane kii
 The Mughals that you have kept up to date with the thinking of women
 aamtaur par purushon kii najar main mahilaayein keval teen prakaar kii hoti hai
 First, with whom they can pass time
 aisi mahilaayein dekhne main sundar, aakarshak deh kii swamini or utane aaazaad vichaaron kii honi chahie, jitna purush chaahate hai
 The second category consists of women whose bodies are not attractive
 aisi mahilaon ko ve mitrataa kii shrenee main rakhana pasand karte hai, kyonki unka rup saundarya purush ko manamohak nahin lagata, isliye ve mitrataa tak hi ruk jate hai
 The third category consists of 'marriageable' girls
 vivaah ke liye 'yogya' kanya main 'comarya' badi aavashyaktaa he
 Generally, the lives of men are entangled in these dilemmas
 zyaadaatar bhartiya purush apni dulhan ke bare main is prakaar kii 9 khaas manyataayen rakhte hai:1
 Usually men think that his future wife is 'virgin'
 uskaa kabhi kisi ke saath shaareerik sambandh naa rahaa ho
 Regardless of the number of girls he has done so himself
 ve bhul jate hai ki jab sex karne ke liye ve mangalsutra pehanaane ko baadhyataa nahin maanate, to aakhir mahilaon se ve aisi apeksha kyon rakhte hai ki vah shaadi tak comarya sambhalakar rakhe
 2
 vah dharmik pravriti kii ho or sari panrparaayein maanati ho
 But there are some girls who do not like worship, who do not believe in religious practices
 purush chaahate hai ki mahilaayein unke liye karwachouth kaa vrath rakhe
 Take interest in all religious functions of the family, whether they like it or not
 ve khud aisa karnaa pasand na karte hon
 In fact, Indian men usually desire a woman as wife who, according to their convenience, shifts between modernity and traditionalism
 3
 Most men feel that women are made just for having children and for their upbringing
 lekin aisa bhi nahin he
 After all, the children belong to both of you, so why should only the women be responsible for raising them? Today, girls pay more attention to their careers
 ve chaahati he ki bacchon se jimmedaari us par der se aae or agar aae bhi, to uskaa patarnar bhi uski is jimmedaari ko saajha kare
 And the partner should also do so
 baccha aap donon kii saajha jimmedaari he
 4
 kehete hai ki purush ke dil kaa rasta uske pet se hokar jaataa he or lagata he ki purushon ne is baat ko vaaki kaaphi gambhirtha se liya he
 They believe that the girl they are getting married to must have cooked food
 lekin, har ladki main yah ‘hunar’ ho jaruri to nahin
 His interest and expertise may be in other areas, but he is not necessarily interested in cooking
 unhen na to kichan main kaam karnaa pasand hota he or na hi unhen is baat ko lekar koi malaal hi hota he
 5
 pati parameshwar vaala daur ab gaya
 Forget that your wife is standing in front of you with one voice
 bas aapaki jarurat hi uski praathamikta ho, ve din ab lad gaye
 Today's women do not compromise their interests and principles
 ye unke aatmavishvaas ke kaaran he
 They are prospering economically and socially
 beshak, ve aapaki baat jarur sunengi, lekin use apane tark kii kasuti par parakhkar hi use maanane yaa manaa karne kaa faisla karengi
 You are his companion in the car of life, not the driver of that car
 6
 In the eyes of orthodox men, women should not think much about career
 ghar ke liye paise kamakar laana purush apni jimmedaari yaa kahen adhikaar samajhate hai
 They believe that if women focus more on their careers, they will deviate from their family responsibilities
 ve mahilaon ko ghar or bacchon kii jimmedaari ke daayre main hi dekhnaa chaahate hai
 If, if the salary of women exceeds that of men, then men pose a question of ego
 7
 He feels that his future wife should take full care of his parents
 par jab baat patni ke maa-baap kii aati he to wo unhen apni jimmedaari se pare samajhate hai
 Then how right is it to expect this from his future wife
 8
 Men do not like that his wife befriends or talks to her male friends
 jabaki ye sharte ve khud par lagu hone nahin dete
 9
 unhen pansad nahin hota ki unki hone vaali patni adhik khule vichaaron kii ho
 They do not want him to talk openly on issues like sex
 par shaayad aapane 'coffee vid karan' main vidya baalan ko ye bolte hue suna ho ki jis tarah purush sex ko injoe karte hai, vaise hi mahilaayein bhi sex ko utana hi injoe karti hai
 So Huzoor, women have changed with changing times, now it's your turn
 apni soch badaliye
 Women are also growing up in the same atmosphere in which you
