 Lohani wants to change the system and change what was going on till now
 lohani ne rail mantralay ke kaamkaaj main sudhaar ke liye karmchaariyon ko anushaasit karne ke liye aparamparaagat maarg apanaaya he
 Railway Board Chairman Lohani has made it clear to the officials of the ministry that the 'VIP culture' has to be stopped to bring about substantial changes in the system
 lohani ne saaf kar diya he ki ab sabhi railway adhikariyon ke uphaar sweekaar karne par sakht pratibandh hoga or saath hi unhen anaavashyak protocol ko chhodane ke liye kaha gaya he
 Lohani's advice to young officers who have recently joined the railways is to keep their tables and offices organized if they wish to make the railways clean and garbage-free

 Lohani worked as Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) 7 years ago

 There will be a policy of zero tolerance on corruption

 a railway ministry official said that Lohani wanted to end the VIP culture immediately
 unhone diarem ko sabhi karmchaariyon ko baraabar maanane ko kaha he or ground staff ke har suzav par dhyaan dene kaa nirdesh diya he
 To end this culture, CRB has ordered the name plates to be removed from the chambers of senior officers in Rail Bhavan

 To overcome deficiencies, direct changes must take place from those working on the ground

 co / rlmlrdgg8t The victory chariot of Narendra Modi stopped in the capital Delhi
 pichley saal ascharyajanak tareeke se satta ke kareeb jaapahunchi aam aadmi party ne is baar use maat de di
 The party won this election in a fight against the thorns of its committed workers
 party ke sansthaapak arvind kejariwal varanasi main parajeet hone ke baad se lagaataar yahaan prachaar kar rahe the or iskaa fal unhen mila
 Let us tell you what are the 10 reasons that the BJP had to face defeat
 1
 Kiran Bedi's candidature: The high command of the BJP made Kiran Bedi, a former aide of Arvind Kejriwal, directly the chief ministerial candidate
 isse party ke varisht netaaon or unke samarthakon main kaaphi rosh paidaa hua
 Senior leaders did not put full force in the election and their supporters were also very passive
 2
 Kiran Bedi's behaviorist Bedi was India's first female police officer and remained in that department for nearly four decades
 vah kadak kism kii adhikari thim or raajnneeti main kudane ke baad bhi unka yah swabhaav badla nahin
 Initially, she did not digest the manner in which she was interacting with the workers and leaders
 isse ve unase dur ho gaye
 His initial statements were also not digested
 3
 Delay in holding elections: BJP high command delayed the election in Delhi
 loksabhaa chunaav main dilli kii 70 siton main se 60 par badhat lene ke kaaran bijepi alaakaman ati aatm vishwasi ho gaya or use lagane laga ki vah kabhi bhi chunaav jeet sakate hai
 If the elections were held immediately thereafter, it would not have been defeated
 4
 Three pieces of MCD were carried out in Delhi Municipality's Nirmampanidilai to bring it efficiency but nothing happened
 inaki kaaryastylee aisi thi ki mahanagar ko gandagi, bhrashtachar or nikammepan kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In all these, the BJP is in power and people are very angry with their way of working
 5
 Negative campaigning: In this election, bjp's campaign was around Kejriwal, that is, the party wasted much time in criticizing him
 apni uplabdhiyon or aage ke kaaryakramon kii baat karne ke bajaay bade-bade vigyapanon ke jariye kejariwal ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 This angered people, just like the Congress campaign that carried out personal attacks against Modi
 wo log jo tatasth the kejariwal kii taraf aa gaye
 6
 sasti bijli, muft panikageriwal ne apni 49 dinon kii sarkaar main sasti bijli or muft pani kaa praavdhaan kiya tha
 a large number of people benefited from this
 log is baar bhi yahi ummid kar rahe the or is aadhaar par unhen vot dene waalon kii taadaad badi thi
 7
 lok lubhaavne vaadekejariwal ne is chunaav main vaadon kaa pitara khol diya
 He made promises on every issue
 pani-bijli se lekar lakhon asthaayee karmchaariyon ko sthaayee karne ke vaade kiye gaye
 About 70 such promises were made in the party's manifesto while BJP did not say anything
 isse party ke samarthakon kii taadaad badi or unhenlagane laga ki kejariwal ke har samasya kaa samaadhaan he
 8
 alpsankhyakais baar 90 fisadi alpsankhyakon ne aam aadmi party ko ek ranneeti ke tahat vot diya or yahi kaaran he ki congress kaa vot pratishat gira
 He was displeased with the return of the RSS and the arrogance of Hinduist organizations
 unhen aam aadmi party main ek vikalp dikhaa
 9
 anya partiyon ke netaaon ko praveshbijapi ne bhi congress kii tarah chalate hue anya partiyon ke kai netaaon ko jagah di
 Some also received stamps
 isse varshon se vahaan kaam kar rahe sthaneey netaa bhadak gaye or unamem se kai ne bhitarghaat kiya
 10
 congress kii niskriyatacongress ne is chunaav ko mahaj khanaapurti kii tarah liya
 He paid no attention to publicity, which the Aam Aadmi Party took advantage of
 usne unke vot bank jinamein jhuggi-jhopadiyaan or alpsankhyak the, kabja kar liya

 Kairana Lok Sabha seat of western Uttar Pradesh, due to which historical enemies Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati came together, is going to vote today
 lekin lagbhag ek saal pehle akhilesh kii samaajawaadee party (SP) or mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party (BSP) kii mili-juli takat dwaara bhartiya janata party (BJP) ko di gai karaari shikast se saamne aae 'kairana model' ke baad se ab tak bahut kuch badal chukaa he, haalanki isi 'kairana model' ke parinaamon se utsahit hokar donon partiyaan loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main bhi rajya kii 80 siton par milakar lard rahi hai, taaki pradhanmantri narendra modi ko doosraa kaarykaal hasil karne se roka ja sake
 Today, in the first phase, voting is going on in eight parliamentary constituencies of Uttar Pradesh, including Kairana, but speculation is rife that Mayawati is not fighting against the BJP in this election, but perhaps joking
 atakalbaazi ko darkinar kar bhi diya jaae, to bhi mayawati ke haalia krityon ne vipaksh ke varisht netaaon ke man main gahari chintaa paidaa kar di he
 He cites a public appeal made by Mayawati to the Muslims of Uttar Pradesh, in which the BSP chief urged her not to waste votes on the Congress
 gauratlab he ki congress ko akhilesh or mayawati ke gathbandhan se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 Now whether this appeal of Mayawati proves to be effective or not, it can give a solid advantage to the BJP, because it will feel that Congress and Mayawati are fighting for Muslim votes, which will polarize the votes of upper caste Hindus
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri or BJP netaa yogi adityanath ne mayawati kii apil ke turant baad hamalaa bolte hue apane pasandida naare 'ali banaam bajrang bali' kaa istemaal kiya, jisane dharm ke naam par pehle bhi voton kaa dhruvikaran kiya he
 In her speeches, Mayawati has launched a blunt attack on the BJP, but equally vigorously she has also attacked the Congress, calling both parties 'two sides of a coin'
 yadi is baat ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaae ki congress khud hi maan chuki he ki uttar pradesh main uskaa khel agle vidhansabha chunaav ke liye chal rahaa he, or is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main unhen khaas ummid nahin he, to mayawati dwaara congress ko bhi BJP kii hi tarah latada janaa ajeeb lagata he
 As far as this writer is concerned, he feels that the kind of 'transaction politics' that 'bahn Ji' has been doing till date, can go with any national party, which on 23 May The upcoming election will depend on the result
 isse unke sahyogi akhilesh yadav ke liye sirdard paidaa ho saktaa he, jo congress kii aalochana bahut halke-halke kar rahe hai, taaki chunaav-baad gathbandhan kaa rasta bana rahe
 Senior leaders told me that Mayawati has also made Akhilesh's attitude towards Congress and asked her to attack the Congress with full force
 samaajawaadee party ke purv mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav pehle hi is baat dukhada ro rahe hai ki unka putr sirf apane parivaar se hi kadai se pesh aa saktaa he (unka ishaara akhilesh ke chachaa shivpal yadav ke party se nikalakar nai party bana lene kii ore tha), jabaki baaki netaaon or partiyon ke liye to vah bich-bich jate hai
 Junior Yadav, i
e
 Akhilesh, had given 100 seats to the Congress even during the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, and BJP had come to power with a record majority
 us vakt bhi, mayawati ne 100 muslim pratyaashee maidan main utaare the, or zyaada se zyaada dhruvikaran sunishchit kar diya tha
 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president Amit Shah has repeatedly asserted in his rallies that he has not given tickets to those who become 'vote banks'
 gauratlab he ki yah muslimon ke liye istemaal kiya jane vaala code he
 It seems, Mayawati is angry with the Congress, because she is trying to put Chandra Shekhar, the Bhim Army president and Jatav Dalit leader popular among the youth
 lekin uttar pradesh main congress dwaara kiye gaye baaki sabhi prayaason kii hi tarah iskaa natiza bhi sifer rahaa, kyonki purvi uttar pradesh ke liye party kii mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne ek baar chandrashekhar se mulaakaat kii, or phir koi follow-ap nahin
 Mayawati is also angry with the fact that her closest ally Nasimuddin Siddiqui, who was expelled from the BSP in 2017, has been ticketed by the Congress from a seat where voting is going on today
 mana jaataa he ki mayawati kai netaaon se congress se ravaiye kii shikaayat kar chuki hai
 He is said to have told Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and Congress leader Kamal Nath, "you guys (congress Party) want to reach Delhi comfortably by riding on an elephant (bsp's election symbol)
" 
 
 main aisa nahin hone duungi
 
 
 "on the other hand, the Congress too has many complaints against Mayawati, ranging from her arrogance to the peculiar demand for seats
 lekin vipakshi dalon ke bich is tanaav se BJP khush ho gai he
 After all, the 'kairana model' was meant to ensure a common candidate against the BJP, as it was the only thing that could defeat the BJP
 baharhaal, amit shah ne sunishchit kar diya he ki BJP ko uttar pradesh kii har seat par kai-kai pratyaashiyon se bhidana pade
 Shivpal Yadal's party, which will surely cut the sp's vote, is getting financial support from BJP itself
 shivpal yadav ne saaf-saaf mujhase kaha, "main apane bhattije (akhilesh yadav) ko pasand nahin karata, jisane meraa apmaan kiya
 
 
 i can work with BJP
 
 
 "chachaa ke iraade bhale hi saarvajanik rup se spasht hai, lekin 'buaa' mayawati ne BJP ke saath chunaav-baad sauda ho jane ko lekar ab tak chuppi sadhi hui he
 The only indication may be that Anuradha Mishra, who is associated with the mother-in-law of Mayawati's closest aide Satish Mishra, joined the BJP on March 9
 vipaksh ke liye sirdard bad gaya he
 According to the official, however, she will not charge any fee for this work and will do the work of dress design for free

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) In this second term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the discussion has intensified on who is number two in his cabinet? The Prime Minister has recently announced several committees, in which two committees are being seen as steps taken to try to bring the country's economy back on track
 ek cameti he iske liye ki desh kii arthvyavastha main nivesh kaise laayaa jaae or duusari cameti he desh main rojgaar paidaa karne ke liye
 The remaining eight more committees have been announced, including the Appointments Committee, the Committee on Commodities, the Economic Affairs Committee, the Political Affairs Committee, the Security Affairs Committee
 
 
 or yah sab cametiyaan ek tarah se sarkaar ko sahi dhang se chalaane ke liye banaai gai hai
 Meanwhile, the discussion went on as to why this was done to Rajnath Singh, who holds the number two position, as Nirmala Sitharaman, who was the defense minister in the previous government, was a member of most of these committees
 is par bhi baat ho rahi thi ki amit shah in sabhi aath cametiyon ke sadsy hai to kya cabinet main ab ve number do kii haisiyat rakhte hai?kai jaankaar maanate hai ki raisina hills, jo ki bharat kii satta kaa centre he, ke north block main ek nayaa shah aayaa he jiske ird gird satta kii seedhi gum rahi he or vah pradhanmantri modi ke baad sabase taqatvar banakar ubhara he
 Amit Shah is not only the Home Minister but also the President of the BJP
 pradhanmantri modi ke nae cabinet main ve unki aankh or kaan maane ja rahe hai
 In all the meetings he has held so far, he invites big bureaucrats and ministers to his office, discussing all the topics simultaneously
 kaha ja rahaa he ki satta ke nae sameekaran main sabase taqatvar banakar ubhare hai amit shah
 And even though Rajnath Singh is sworn in after the Prime Minister at the official swearing-in ceremony, and even though Rajnath officially holds the number two position, Amit Shah is actually number two in terms of functioning
 rajnath singh ke liye yah raahat kii baat he ki unhen sabase mahatvapurn suraksha maamalon kii cabinet cameti main pehle hi rakh liya gaya tha
 This committee is for the security of the country, whether internal or external
 koi bhi nirnay, chaahe vah desh ke dushman mulk ke khilaaf koi karrwai karne kaa ho yaa desh kii aantarik suraksha ke liye ho, isi cameti main liya jaataa he
 Therefore, it is considered very important to be a member of this committee
 haalanki yah to tay he ki raksha mantri hone ke naate rajnath singh ko is cameti main rakhaa hi janaa tha lekin grih mantri ke rup main amit shah ke paas dheron aise kaam hai jise aap desh kii nabz bhi kah sakate hai
 They also have a case in Kashmir, about which there is also speculation that there will be a new delimitation
 haalanki is khabar kii abhi tak aadhikarik pushti kisi ne nahin kii he
 Officially, even though it is said that Rajnath Singh is the number two in the cabinet and in the absence of the Prime Minister, that is, if the Prime Minister goes abroad and there is a case when the cabinet's opinion has to be sought, then the cabinet can call the cabinet, He can also preside over it
 aisa maamla tab dekhne ko mila tha jab tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh biimaar the or unki anupasthiti main cabinet kii baithak pranab mukherjee ne bulaai thi
 Being the most senior minister in the cabinet, he had a meeting
 ve us vaqt videsh mantri the
 So far, it has been seen that no one should have the Ministry of Defense and Home Affairs as the number two in the cabinet, the most senior minister after the Prime Minister, who has the most experience
 is sarkaar main yah tay he ki amit shah hi sabase zyaada power rakhte hai
 Perhaps the reason for this is to be close to the Prime Minister and also to be BJP President
 unki ranneeti kii vajah se bijepi ko is chunaav main itnaa baari bahumat mila he
 Sayers are also saying that the equations have changed in this government and Amit Shah has emerged as a new center of power
 ve north block ke nae shah hai
 On the incidents of increasing mob lynching in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that a single incident like this is very unfortunate, everyone should rise above politics and work towards ensuring peace and unity in society
 samachar agency eenai ko diye ek saakshaatkaar main piem modi ne kaha ki unhone or unki party (bijepi) ne kai maukon par spasht shabdon main aisi ghatnaon or aisi maansikta vaale logon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai karne kii baat kahi he
 One such incident is unfortunate
 har kisi ko samaaj main shanti or ekta sunishchit karne ke liye raajnneeti se upar uthanaa chahie
 Terming the incidents of mob lynching as crime, Prime Minister Modi said that it would be a joke to do politics by keeping such incidents (mob lynching) limited to mere statistics
 ek hokar is tarah kii ghatnaon kaa virodh karne ke bajaay aparaadh or hinsa jaisi ghatnaon kaa raajnneetik phayda uthaanaa ek vikrut maansikta kaa parichaayak he
 On the increasing crime against women, Modi said that he had told the ramparts of the Red Fort as soon as he took charge of the Prime Minister that it was the responsibility of the government, society and family to protect the dignity of women
 sarkaar ke str par hamane mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh ko rokane ke liye sakht kanoon banaae gaye hai jisamen kuch aparaadhon ke liye faansee kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan kiya he

 He said that our view is that the present constitutional crisis can be solved only by accepting a constitution that accepts fundamental rights, private rights and the rule of law and harmonizes with Egypt's international commitments

 " Dead bodies are now being bought and sold in the market of living humans
 ab chunki murde bolte nahin, lihaaja wo kisase or kahaan shikaayat karen? or bas yahi wo cheez he jisane is kaarobaar ko hawa de rakhi he
 But before telling about the new market of this horse-trading, let us remind you of an incident of six years old
 bihar se pehle rajasthan kii baat bataate hai
 May 2010 Sriganganagar, Rajasthan One room
 isamen raat ke vakt koi insaan galati se daakhil ho jaae to dar ke maare uski chikhen nikal jaaen
 Those with weak heart can die by seeing this scene
 is kamare main he hi kuch aisa jise dekh kar kisi ke bhi hosh phakhta ho sakate hai
 The reason is the human bodies present here
 ji haa, is kamare main is vakt ek do yaa teen nahin darjanon laashen maujuud hai
 Here, several dead are kept together in the same room
 inamen se kuch taaja hai to kuch maheenon puraane
 But all these dead bodies have been immersed in a chemical, due to which the effect of these can be safe for many years
 magar insaani laashon ko sambhaal kar rakhane kii ye koshish kyon kii gai he? murdon ke liye ek cameraa kyon banaaya gaya he?in saare sawaalon kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye isi imaarat main bane ek duusare kamare kaa jayja liya
 Right next to the whereabouts of the dead, this is the room which is called the displacement room that works here
 is kamare main insaani laashon kii cheer faad kii jaati he, taaki in laashon ke jariye insaani jism main chhipe raaj fash kiye ja saken
 
 ise anetami kii padhai kaha jaataa he
 In the whole world, the practice of cadaver or tearing of corpses is common for medical studies
 kyonki medical ke students ko insaani jism kii banaavat or andruni hisson kii jaankaree dene kaa isse aasaan tarika or koi nahin he
 But do you know from where the dead people go for this medical education? How is the demand for corpses of medical colleges met? If not, today we will open before you a secret related to the purchase and sale of corpses that will make your hair stand up
 par iske liye ab patna kii ghatana par prakaash daalana hoga
 Because by making the dead skeletons, the new market for those skeletons is currently open here
 jahaan murdon kii kii boli lagati he, jahaan kankal kii kharid-farokht hoti he
 People standing outside the post mortem house in Muzaffarpur government hospital i
e
 Srikrishna Singh Medical College and Hospital are engaged in bargaining of corpses
 ji haa, is aspataal main lambey samay se jari kankalon kii kharid-farokht kii khabaron kaa sach jaanane ke liye jab under cover reportron kii ek team yahaan tak pahunchi, to yahaan ke mulaazimon kii baaten sunakar dang rah gai
 These attendants of the post mortem house were bidding corpses sitting here for a few rupees
 mahaz paanch sau rupye advance milte hi is andercover team ke liye khopadi or haddiyon se bharaa ek dibba uthaakar laae
 The team of reporters of Dainik Bhaskar decided to conduct a sting operation here to remove the curtain from this dark reality of the post mortem house
 unke khufia camere main jo tasviren qaid hui wo vaaki chaunkaanewaali thi
 The post-mortem house workers said that they remove their flesh from the unclaimed corpses brought here and boil the bones and separate them
 isse wo lambey samay tak kharaab nahin hote or phir unhen aage bech dete hai
 This undercover team also expressed a desire to buy the skeleton
 un par thodaa bharosa hote hi wo saat se aath hazaar rupee prati kankal ke hisaab se jhat is team ko do se teen dinon ke andar teen-chaar kankal muhaiyaa karwaane ko taiyaar ho gaye
 These skeletal men not only promised to get the skeletons at all costs, but also showed us the box which had been hidden in the post-mortem house as a sample
 shrikrishna medical college and hospital kii ye haalat tab he, jab laavaaris laashon ke antim sanskaar ke liye naa sirf har zile main ek cameti hoti he
 Funds are also given by the government for this
 beshak wo fund kaafii kam he, lekin cameti mempulicebhi hoti he
 Despite this, it is not difficult to understand when the skeletons openly buy and sell

 Ranveer Singh is currently making headlines with "gully Boy", but due to his attire he mostly stays in the limelight
 unhone akele dam par apane fishan-sens se industry main nayaa kalt sthapit karne main kamyaabi pai he
 Irrespective of the event, Ranveer's unclothed outfit always gathers discussion
 karan johar ne coffee vid karan par khulaasa kiya tha ki ranvir ke zyaadaatar kapade darasal, karan johar ke hote hai
 Since Karan does not have the courage to carry them, he gives these clothes to Ranveer
 instagram par kaaphi active ranvir apni in poshaakon ke saath pos bhi dete nazar aate hai
 In such a situation, the question also arises whether Ranveer ever repeats these clothes? When asked this question to Ranveer Singh, who arrived for the promotion of Gully Boy, he said, "ya dude, what are you talking about
" maine apana chashma ripet kiya he
 Many have also worn clothes again
 mujhe lagata he ki aapako jo bhi acha lagata he, bina zyada soche bina pahan lenaa chahie
 "alia Bhatt, who was with Ranveer, said," i think Ranveer mixes and matches his clothes quite sensibly

 worldcup 2019 kaa final nakhun chaba dene vaala tha
 As if the breath of the cricket audience ceased
 shaayad isse badhiya cricket worldcup kaa final kabhi dekha hi naa gaya ho
 First match was tied and super over to get the result but it was also tie
 lekin england world champion ban gaya or newjiland ke lakhon cricket phens kaa dil tut gaya
 How did England win when the score was tied, the question is in everyone's mind
 is sawaal kaa jawaab yahaan padhein
 
 
 Indeed, New Zealand batted first and scored 241 runs and England needed 242 runs to become World Champion
 lekin england bhi 50 over main maatr 241 ran hi bana sakaa or match taai ho gaya
 This tie match resulted in a super over, in which England scored 15 runs and later New Zealand were also able to score only 15 runs
 isliye match yahaan bhi taai ho gaya
 The result was based on the boundary
 When there was no result, the result of the match was based on 'whose boundary is more'
 or isi aadhaar par england worldcup jeet gaya
 England made a total of 26 boundaries in their innings and New Zealand a total of 17
 england kii pari main kul boundry22 chauke, 2 chakke2 chauke (super over main)newjiland kii pari main kul boundry14 chauke, 2 chakke1 chakka (super over main)so close, yet so far

 The woman who had such a big rip-off, lost everything, she sold her honor to gain power
 or samaajawaadee party se gathbandhan kar mahilaon kii asmat par daag lagaaya he
 Sadhna Singh did not stop, she said that we feel hesitant to call her a woman, she is worse than a eunuch
 bijepi vidhayak kii is abhrad tippanee par bispi ke rajyasabha saansad satish chandra mishra ne kaha ki bispi pramukh ke liye jin shabdon kaa prayog kiya gaya wo bijepi ke str ko dikhaata he
 He said that with the announcement of SP-BSP alliance, BJP leaders have lost their mental balance
 sapa supremeo akhilesh yadav ne bhi bijepi vidhayak ke bayaan kii ninda kii he
 The kind of objectionable abuses that the BJP female MLA from Mughalsarai has used for Ms
 Mayawati ji are utterly condemnable
 ye bhaajapa ke naitik diwaliyapan or hataasha kaa pratik he
 This is also an insult to the women of the country
 — Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh)january 19, 2019dayashankar singh ko bijepi ne kiya tha baharsaal 2017 main uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon se thik pehle bijepi netaa dayashankar singh ne mayawati kii tulana vaishya se kii thi
 After which the political uproar had arisen
 is puure maamle ko bispi or vipaksh ke netaaon ne dalit virdohi bataate hue jabardast virodh kiya tha
 Seeing the matter growing, the administration also took action and arrested Singh and he was shown the way out of the party
 haalanki tab mayawati par kii gai abhadra tippanee kii aalochana karte hue nasimuddin siddiqui ne bhi dayashankar singh kii beti ko lekar aapattijnak bayaan de diya
 Due to which the BJP got a weapon to fight the atmosphere against them
 dayashankar singh kii patni swati singh ne mayawati ke khilaaf morcha khol diya
 Later Swati Singh was made the President of UP Bijpi women's unit
 vidhansabha chunaav main ve lakhanu ke sarojninagar se vidhayak baniin or unhen yogi adityanath sarkaar main mantri banaaya gaya
 Rita Bahuguna has also commented that before this, there have been political attacks on Mayawati
 lekin raajnneetik bayaanbaji main kuch netaaon ne shabdon kii maryaada laanghte hue nijee hamale bhi kiye
 In 2009, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, then president of the then UP Congress and currently a minister in the Yogi government, also made objectionable remarks on Mayawati
 balaatkaar ke ek maamle main tatkaaleen upi kii mayawati sarkaar dwaara muaavja die jane ko lekar muradabad main tippanee karte hue joshi ne kaha tha ki unke (mayawati) balaatkaar ke badale yah rakam kam he, ise mayawati ke munh par phenk dena chahie
 BSP leaders and activists, angered by Joshi's statement, burnt his house on 15 July 2009
 jabaki unhen muradabad main mukhyamantri ke bare main apmanjanak bhaashan dene ke liye giraftaar kar liya gaya
 She also expressed regret for her controversial statement but Mayawati said that her crime was not forgivable
 kya bijepi apni mahila vidhayak par karegi karrwai?aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon ke maddenjar uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ke gathbandhan ke elaan ke baad bijepi netaaon dwaara mayawati or akhilesh par raajnneetik hamalaa tej ho gaya he
 As the election mercury rises, these attacks are likely to intensify
 lekin aise netaaon ko apni bhashaa kii maryaada kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga, kyonki raajnneeti kaa takaza kahata he ki nijee tippanee antat: usee ko phayda pahunchaati he jiske upar kii jaati he
 In a personal attack on Mayawati, the bjp's female MLA has given the BSP a chance to be the attacker
 or chunavi saal main bispi aisa koi bhi mauka apane haath se nahin jane degi
 Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has indicated that he hardly plays with three spinners in the first Test with England starting on Thursday
 dhoni ne match purv sandhya par kaha, "agar hamen kanpur (2008 dakshin africa ke khilaaf) jaisaa wicket miltaa he to ham teen spinneron ke saath khilne par vichaar kar sakate hai
 In the bowling attack, there is always a possibility to make changes according to the situation
 " Following this statement by Dhoni, the possibility of star spinner Harbhajan Singh returning to the team after a year in the playing XI decreases
 aise main team kii spinner kaman ravichandran aswin or pragyan ojha par rahegi
 Dhoni said, "ashwin and Ojha understand each other very well
 yah kaaphi jaruri he
 Ojha bowls very economically at one end and maintains the situation unlike the opposition team, on the other hand Ashwin shows aggressive play
 " Dhoni refused to say that through this series the Indian team would like to equalize the 0–4 defeat to England in 2011
 tippaniyan Dhoni said, "we only know that when we go to the field we will have a red ball in our hand and two teams are playing
 aap ise koi bhi naam de sakate hai
 " yuvaraj ko lekar puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main dhoni ne kaha, "yuvaraj ke liye sabase acchhee baat yah he ki vah ballebaaji ke saath-saath gendbaaji bhi kar sakate hai or chunki hamaari team main ek harfanmaulaa khilaadi kii kami he lihaaja unke jaisaa khilaadi kaaphi upyogi sabit hoga
 His contribution to the team is very important
 " Dhoni said on the eve of the match, "if we get a wicket like Kanpur (2008 against South Africa), then we can consider playing with three spinners
 gendbaaji akraman main halaat ke mutabik badlaav karne kii hameshaa sambhaavna bani rahati he
 " dhoni ke is bayaan ke baad team main ek saal ke baad vaapasi karne vaale star spinner harbhajan singh ke antim ekadash main sthaan paane kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he
 In such a situation, the spinner command of the team will be on Ravichandran Ashwin and Pragyan Ojha
 dhoni ne kaha, "aswin or ojha ek duusare ko acchhee tarah samajhate hai
 This is quite important
 ojha ek chor par kaaphi kifayati gendbaaji karte hai or halaat vipakshi team ke vipareet banaae rakhte hai duusari ore aswin aakraamak khel dikhaate hai
 " dhoni ne yah kehane se inkaar kar diya ki is shrunkhlaa ke madhyam se bhartiya team 2011 main england ke haathon mili 0-4 kii haar kaa hisaab baraabar karnaa chaahegi
 The comments dhoni ne kaha, "ham sirf itnaa jaanate hai ki jab ham maidan main jaaenge to hamaare haath main laal gend hogi or do timen khel rahi hongi
 You can give it any name
 " In response to a question about Yuvraj, Dhoni said, "the best thing for Yuvraj is that he can bat as well as bowling and since our team lacks an all-rounder, a player like him is very much Will prove useful team ke liye unka yogadan kaaphi ahm he
 " dhoni ke is bayaan ke baad team main ek saal ke baad vaapasi karne vaale star spinner harbhajan singh ke antim ekadash main sthaan paane kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he
 In such a situation, the spinner command of the team will be on Ravichandran Ashwin and Pragyan Ojha

 Some people in the line are complaining about not having digital payment on ticket windows in jantar-mantar, Amer Fort and Nahargarh Fort, then some people are worried about not getting open but digital payment in private tourist places like City Palace and Jaigarh Appearing happy to have the facility
 jaisalmer main to haalat ye he ki log vahaan gharon par ruke hue hai kyonki hotalon main jagah hin nahin he
 The number of foreign tourists has come down here
 People say that seeing the way people have come out to roam, it does not seem that demonetisation has taken effect

 Even underworld kingpin Dawood Ibrahim felt his ground shaking
 bahut mumkin he ki isi vajah se usne 1997 main ‘casette king’ gulshan kumaar kii hatya main vaanchit sangeetkaar nadeem saifi ko bhartiya kanoon ke ghere main naa aane dene ke liye haath-pair maarna shuru kar diya he
 India Today / Today has access to such tapes, in which Dawood himself can be heard on the phone worrying about the Indian government's campaign and Nadeem
 nabbe ke dashak main bollywood kii ek hit sangeetkaar jodi kaa sadsy rah chukaa nadeem saifi lambey samay se britain main nirvaasan main rah rahaa he
 Nadeem was named as a co-suspect in the 12 August 1997 murder of Gulshan Kumar in Mumbai

 Gulshan Kumar died on the spot

 Dawood can be heard expressing concern in these tapes of recorded conversations since 2015
 sutron ke mutabik, daaud jis shaks ke bare main chintaa jataa rahaa he wo or koi nahin nadeem saifi hi he
 Conversation tapes reveal how one of Dawood's henchmen is warning him of a possible legal threat to the wanted musician
 bataa rahaa he ki sangeetkaar ke britain se bharat pratyrpan sambandhi modi sarkaar ke taaja shuru kiye gaye prayaason ke kya nihitarth ho sakate hai
 It can be heard in conversation using specific codewords of the underworld
 jaise ki nadeem saifi kaa hawala dene ke liye ‘landan frand’ or ‘ustad’ jaise sambodhan
 However, intelligence officials decoding this codeword language have identified the person for whom the 'london master' is being referred to as Nadeem Saifi during the conversation
 dubai sthiti daaud kaa ek gurga britain main nadeem saifi kii sambhavit giraftaar kii sthiti main use underground karne ke plan ke bare main bataa rahaa he

 For nearly two years, an order from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) stalled projects of big builders
 mangalvaar ko ek hi jatke main engiti ke faisle se logon ko badi raahat mili he
 In fact, NGT has said in its latest decision that the Okhla bird sanctuary will be an eco-sensitive zone of only 100 meters
 engiti ne oktober 2013 ke apane us faisle ko badal diya he jisamen pakshi vihaar ke 10 kilometre ke daayre main nirmaan par roak lagane kaa aadesh diya gaya tha
 It is worth mentioning that the advocate Gaurav Bansal had filed a petition in the National Green Tribunal last year seeking a stay on the construction of more than 50 building projects in Noida
 saal 1990 main supreme court ne sarkaar seokhla pakshi vihaarake 10 kilometre ke daayre ko paryaavaran kii drushti se atisamvedansheel ghoshit karne kaa aadesh dete hue is kshetra main nirmaan par roak laga di thi
 After this, in April 2015, the government directed the government to declare the area around bird sanctuary as susceptible
 dilli or upi sarkaar ne mahaj 100 meter kshetra ko atisamvedansheel ghoshit karne kaa prastaav centre sarkaar ke paas bheja tha
 But the Ministry of Environment Ministry rejected this and asked the Central Government to do 1 around Okhla bird sanctuary
 2 kilometre ke daayre ko paryaavaran ke lihaaj se atisamvedansheel ghoshit karne ko kaha
 It is now the decision of NGT that the dreams of about twenty five thousand people in Kinoedam have been fulfilled

 Did not understand how to console

 Then asked him to walk indoors

 There was weeds in the courtyard of this small two-room house
 
 
 farsh par bichhi chadar par baithi maa shamima bano or bahan rukhsana bano kii ankhen shunya ko nihaar rahi thim
 
 
 The sound of our footsteps broke their expressionless peace

 Mother's chest pain came on her tongue, "I taught him with the same hands by washing utensils and cleaning them in the homes of others, but he left
" 
 
 " When the mother was crying, the daughter was comforting by placing her hand on her shoulder, but in the memory of her brother, she was also bursting inside herself

 That support also snatched away from us

 ?" In fact, 20-year-old Adil along with some of his friends was rescuing the people stranded in the flood
 
 
 paanch din tak ji-jaan se juta rahaa
 
 
 For whom he could not do anything else, then he kept delivering water to them
 
 
 phir chathe din khud hi pani main bah gaya
 
 
 Neighbor Jaladuldin explains, "he was reaching the people by tying a water bottle to the body
 
 
 jab ded body mili, to us par bhi pani kii bottle bandhi hui thi

 The ancestral work of the Chaupan community is for grazing cattle, but after studying up to the ninth, Adil started working as a plumber so that the family could afford it
 
 
 mere daryaft karne par ghar ke logon ne vah sandook utarkar dikhaaya, jisamen uske auzaar pade the
 
 
 It came to mind, these tools will always be waiting for his hands, but Adil will never come to touch or lift them
 
 
 pita ko thik se dikhaai nahin detaa, so, vahi pita kii ankhon kii roshni bhi tha
 
 
 The kitchen stove also used to burn with the same, but now apart from salt and turmeric, all the cans of ration are empty
 
 
 abhi to paas-padosi madad kar rahe hai, lekin parivaar dane-dane ko mohataaj ho gaya he, kyonki ab inkaa adil nahin rahaa

 Apart from the attacks, there were other incidents in which Dinesh Bhagchandani was attacked on 16 March 2014
 dinesh asaram kaa purv sahyogi or gavaah he
 On 28 February 2014 Vimilesh Thakkar was attacked
 vimalesh narayan ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karaane vaali ladki kaa kareebi he
 a woman policeman was also attacked outside the Jodhpur court, along with an attempt to kill Asaram's former videographer Rahul Patel
 ab asaram cese kii peedit ladki ne sibiai jaanch kii maang kii he or uske pita ne aarope lagaaya he ki sabhi hamalon ke peeche asaram hai
 The comments puure desh main kareeb 450 ashram chalaane vaale asaram or uskaa betaa narayan sai balaatkaar ke aarope main ek arase se jail main hai
 Yet the airs are so much that even during their appearance in court, their statements are enough to frighten the witnesses
 halaat ye hai ki asaram cese kii sunwaayee kar rahe jaj or asaram ko jail se laane vaale ek pulicekarmi tak ko dhamkee mil chuki he, lekin usase zyada hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki aaj tak in tamaam gavaahon par hamale karne vaale ek bhi aaropee tak police nahin pahunch saki he
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the power of Asaram and his henchmen, who have acquired wealth in the name of spirituality, is overshadowing the police
 hamalon ke alaava kuch or bhi vaaradaaten huin, jinamein 16 march 2014 ko dinesh bhagachandani par hamalaa hua

 phir bhi akad itani ki peshi ke liye court aane ke dauraan bhi unke bayaan gavaahon ko daraane ke liye kaaphi hote hai
 The situation is that even the judge hearing the Asaram case and a policeman who brought Asaram from jail have been threatened, but what is more surprising is that not even a single accused who attacked these witnesses till date The police could not reach
 aise main ye sawaal uthne lajimi hai ki kya aadhyatm ke naam par daulat hasil kar chuke asaram or uske gurgon kii takat police par baari pad rahi he

 The Mayawati government of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) remained focused on the development of Ambedkar villages throughout its tenure, now the Akhilesh government of the Samajwadi Party (SP) will open the box for the development of Lohia villages
 lekin sawaal yah he ki un gaanvon kaa kya hoga, jo na 'ambedkar' or na 'lohia' yojana ke daayre main honge
 When the BSP government was formed in the year 2007, Mayawati overturned most decisions of the Mulayam Singh Yadav government

 bihar ek baar phir baadh kii chapet main he
 The state's population of over 25 lakhs is affected
 rajya ke kareeb 12 jilon ke 77 prakhandon ke 546 panchayat pani main duube hue hai
 So far 34 people have died
 saalon se chali aa rahi is samasya par sarkaar ke tamaam daavon ke baavjood halaat vaise hi hai, jaise har saal rahete hai
 For the last 40 years, from 1979 till now, Bihar has been continuously facing floods every year
 bihar sarkaar ke jal sansaadhan vibhaag ke mutabik rajya kaa 68,800 varg kimi har saal baadh main dub jaataa he
 Let us know why Bihar drowns in flood every year
 
 
 bihar main baadh aane ke chaar pramukh kaaran hai
 
 
 1
 nepal chodta he pani, to dub jate hai bihar ke kai ilakepichley do hafte se nepal or bihar ke simavarti kshetra main baari barish hone ke kaaran nadiyon ke jalastr main baari vruddhi hui he
 Flood waters have entered the Araria, Kishanganj, Farbisganj, Purnia, Supaul, Madhubani, Darbhanga and Katihar districts of North Bihar
 kosi, kamala, baagmati, gandak, mahananda samet uttar bihar kii tamaam choti-badi nadiyon ke tatbandhon ke kinare based saikadon gaanv jalmagn ho gaye hai
 Whenever the water level rises in Nepal, it opens the doors of its dams

 She deposits it at her mouth in the Ganges
 isaki vajah se pani aasapaas ke ilaakon main failane lagata he
 If there is no silt in the river and water flows remain, such problems would not come

 Decrease of embankments as per requirement was 160 km of embankment in Bihar in 1954
 tab 25 lakh hectare jameen baadh prabhavit thi
 There are about 3700 km of embankments now, but the area affected by floods has increased to 68
 90 lakh hectare ho gaya
 Due to the way in which the flood is increasing, the number of embankments is not increasing
 4
 Indiscriminate harvesting of trees in catchment areas There is continuous indiscriminate harvesting of trees in catchment areas in Bihar
 isaki vajah se cachament aria main pani rukta hi nahin
 The catchment area of the Kosi River is 74,030 km किमी
 isamen se 62,620 varg kimi nepal or tibet main he
 Only 11,410 sq km is in Bihar
 pahaado par sthit nepal or tibet main zyada barish hoti he to pani vahaan ke cachament aria se bahakar bihar main sthit nichle cachament aria main aata he
 Due to the absence of trees, the water does not stop in the catchment area and spreads to the populated areas

 kya hota he chandragrahan / What is Lunar Eclipse?jab surya or chandramaa ke bich prithvi aa jaati he to surya kii puri roshni chandramaa par nahin padati he
 This is called lunar eclipse

 The lunar eclipse always occurs on the full moon night
 ek saal main adhiktam teen baar prithvi ke upachaaya se chandramaa gujarata he, tabhi chandragrahan lagata he
 Like solar eclipse, lunar eclipse can be partial and complete
 puranic manyata / Chandra Grahan beliefshimxu dharm main grahan ko lekar kai tarah kii puranic manyataayen hai
 There is also a story behind the lunar eclipse
 kaha jaataa he ki ek baar rahu (asur) or devataaon (bhagwaan) ke bich ladaai ho rahi thi
 Both the deity and the demon wanted to receive the blessing of immortality and the nectar
 tabhi vishnu ne mohini kaa rup dhaaran karke rahu ko mohit kar liya or usase amrit hasil kar liya
 Rahu also thought of playing the tricks of the gods to get nectar
 usne devtaa kaa bhesh dhaaran kiya or amrit bantane kii pankti main apni baari kaa intjaar karne laga
 But Sun and Moon recognized him
 vishnu bhagwaan ne rahu kaa sir kaat diya or vah do grahon main vibhakt ho gaya- rahu or ketu
 To take revenge from the Sun and the Moon, Rahu left his shadow on both which we know as solar eclipse and lunar eclipse
 isiilie grahan kaal ko ashubh or nakaaratmak shaktiyon ke prabhavi hone kaa samay mana jaataa he
 What to do and what not to do during lunar eclipse / Do and Dont's on Chandra Grahan Devpuja is also prohibited during the eclipse
 isi kaaran anek mandiron ke kapaat grahan ke samay band kar die jate hai
 Temples of temples are also closed due to applying sutak before 12 hours of eclipse

 At the time of Sutak, food etc
 should not be taken and water should not be consumed
 grahan se pehle hi jis paatr main pine kaa pani rakhte hon usamen kusha or tulsi ke kuch pattey daal dene chahie
 Kusha and Tulsi have amazing power to store bacteria spreading in the environment at the time of eclipse
 grahan ke baad pani ko badal lenaa chahie
 It has also been proved by many scientific researches that the digestive power of a person becomes very relaxed at the time of eclipse
 aise main yadi unke pet main dooshit ann yaa pani chalaa jayega to unke biimaar hone kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 On July 26, 1953, the longest lunar eclipse of the 20th century was on July 26, 1953, the longest lunar eclipse of the twentieth century

 istemaal karne kaa tarika:10 se 12 reetha ko 6 cap pani main dubokar rakh dijie
 Heat it for some time
 ab ye acchhee tarah garm ho jaae to ise raatbhar ke liye isi tarah chhod dijie
 After this, wake up the next morning and fill the water of Reetha in an airtight bottle
 aap chahen to isamen neembu kii kuch boonden bhi milakar rakh sakate hai

 You can use it to wash hands if you want
 ho sake to reetha ke pani main kuch boond neembu kaa ras mila den taaki isaki sugandh acchhee ho jaae or saath hi neembu kaa ras ise zyada dinon tak sahi rakhega

 jaanwaron ko nahalaane ke liejanwaron ke liye koun sa utpaada sahi rahegaa or koun sa nahin, ye tay kar paanaa bahut mushkil he

 reetha ke pani ko daag kii jagah par ulkar thodaa ragadne se daag dur ho jayega
 Apart from this, if you want, you can also clean your car with this water

 janata ko agar express-ve nahin pasand aayaa to shaayad usne upi main bullate train ke liye vot diya ho
 He said, the public would think that the government which will form it will give pension over 1000 rupees per month
 hamane kisaanon kaa 1600 karod rupee karj maaf kiya tha
 Now it would seem that in the first cabinet meeting of BJP, the debt of UP farmers will be forgiven, what will be more happiness than this
 unhone kaha, janata ko lagata hoga ki jo sarkaar banegi vah 1000 rupee maheene se zyada pension degi
 We had waived the debt of Rs
 1600 crores of farmers
 ab lagata hoga ki bhaajapa kii pehali cabinet baithak main upi ke kisaanon kaa karj maaf ho jayega, isse zyada khushi kii baat or kya hogi
 Today Gopashtami is being celebrated
 is din desh bhar main gaay kii puja karne ke saath hi gau mata ko haraa chaara or gud khilaayaa jaataa he
 Though there is politics in the country about the cow, there is also reverence and faith in the people
 gaay ko aasthaa ke taur par maanane vaale aaj gopashtami ke din gaay kii puja or aarti karte hai
 Also feed him fodder
 varanasi main ho rahi gaay kii poojagopashtami ke dinavaranasike durgakund sthit dharm sangh main na sirf gaayon kii vidhivat puja kii gai balki unki aarti bhi utaari gai
 With this, the march was taken out and a message of protection was given to those who consider cow to be a medium for baking their political bread
 jaane, chhath ke tisare din kyon diya jaataa he duubate surya ko arghya
 
 
 Lord Krishna had worshiped that it is believed that on the day of Gopashti, Kamdhenu cow who came from heaven to earth, giving compassion and compassion to all beings, was worshiped in the ashram of sage Vasistha
 kyon shuru hote hai devuthni ekadshi se saare shubh kaam
 
 
 It is also said that on this day, Lord Krishna gave the status of mother by worshiping cows in Vrindavan and since then this tradition has been going on continuously
 aaj puure desh main gaay ko or varanasi main khaastaur par is khaas parv ko manaane kii parampara he
 It is not what is thought in the Bigg Boss house
 aaj bhi kuch aisa hi dekhne ko milegaa
 Today will be mid-week aviation and Andy will be driven from home
 is samay ghar main paanch log rah rahe the
 Of which Sangram's name had already been finalized
 gauhar, tanisha, ejaj or endi main se ek ko baahar hona tha
 Gaz fell on Andy
 unhen jeetne kaa bada daavedaar mana ja rahaa tha, lekin unke baahar hone se unke chaahane waalon ko bada jhatka pahonchega
 Because of Andy, there has been a lot of ruckus in the house and making fun of it too
 lekin aakhir main unhen ghar se baahar hona padaa he
 Now four people are left in the last match
 ham ye to nahin kahenge ki garmiyaan aa gai hai lekin baavjood iske aapako thodaa-thodaa garmi kaa ahsaas to hone hi laga hoga
 To overcome this feeling of heat, you must have started eating ice cream, drinking normal water instead of hot and wondering what to do this time in this summer that will keep you fresh and also give you a feeling of freshness

 com / gaxfskhnhy The Jharkhand Vikas Morcha on Monday announced withdrawal of support from the Congress-led UPA government at the Center to protest against the relaxation of foreign direct investment in retail trade
 jhavimo (pra) ke adhyaksh evam purv mukhyamantri babulal marandi ne party ke is nirnay kii jaankaree dete hue kaha ki centre sarkaar kaa yah faisla aam janata ke hiton ke puri tarah se khilaaf he
 The comments unhone haal main dijal ke daam badaye jane or rasoi gas silendar kii rashning kaa bhi purajor virodh kiya
 Marandi said, "we are withdrawing support from the UPA government at the Center due to their anti-people policies and will soon meet the President and hand him a letter of withdrawal of support
" ’’ Jamshedpur MP Ajay Kumar from the party was also present
 vartmaan loksabhaa main jhavimo (pra) ke kul do saansad he, jisamen kumaar ke alaava marandi shaamil he

 tippaniyan He also strongly opposed the recent increase in diesel prices and rationing of LPG cylinders
 marandi ne kaha, ‘‘ham log centre kii samprag sarkaar se unki janvirohi nitiyon ke chalate samarthan waapas le rahe he or jaldi hi raashtrapati se milakar unhen samarthan vaapasi kaa patr bhi saunpenge
 '' party se jamshedpur se saansad ajay kumaar bhi maujuud the

 Election posters in the capital Delhi are not just on the walls
 chunaav abhiyaan kaa dayera bas-stop, auto rickshaw, metro rail, efem radio se lekar televijan tak har jagah fail gaya he
 Despite being stuck in a long jam, do not understand the big deal if the assembly elections held in Delhi at the end of this year, if they change the color of politics completely after one and half decade
 desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan agast 2013 main dilli darbar kii nai surat ubhartee dikh rahi he
 Arvind Kejriwal's general party is making these elections triangular
 janamat surveykshan ke mutabik is samay 33 fisadi log congress ke paksh main or 35 fisadi log bijepi ke paksh main apni raay rakh rahe hai
 At the same time, 17 per cent people are telling their choice to RTI activist-turned-politician Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 dilli main pehali baar kisi rajnatik dal ko apni sthapana ke itane kam samay main is tarah kaa jan samarthan miltaa dikhaa ho
 In the survey, he still seems far away from power, but his plight to fall the throne or become a kingmaker is not hidden from anyone
 ummid thi ki kejariwal kii party sabase zyada chot bijepi ko pahunchaayegi, lekin dilli waalon kaa taaja rujhaan bataata he ki ve congress kii chaati par to mung dal hi rahe hai, saath hi apratyaashit rup se bispi ko bada dhakka pahunchaa rahe hai
 This trend is ruining the notion of getting only the support of the middle class at the time of the Lokpal movement and for the Dalit and deprived sections to stay away from it
 party ke netaa manish sitaudiya kii raay he, ''dilli kii upree chamak-dhamak ke neeche aam aadmi buniyadi jaruraton ke liye taras rahaa he
 We are raising this issue and people are understanding this very well
 ”'aap’ kii is pahal se taaja surveykshan main congress ko 2009 kii tulana main 7 fisadi, bijepi ko 1 fisadi or anya ko 9 fisadi voton kaa ghaataa hota dikh rahaa he
 If someone is in profit then Kejriwal
 agar siton ke lihaaj se dekhen to 2009 main congress ko 43 siten mili thim, vahiin ab vah 28 siton par simatati dikh rahi he
 On the other hand, BJP also seems to get the same number of seats, which is five more than in 2009
 anya partiyaan siton ke maamle main badhat hasil kar rahi hai or unki sankhya chaar se badhkar paanch ho sakati he
 The poll appears to give 9 seats to AAP
 jaahir he ki kisi rajnatik dal kii safalataa ke phul pruf aankade ko chunaav se pehle hi pesh kar dena bahut budhimaani kaa kaam nahin kaha ja saktaa, lihaaja surveykshan main congress or bijepi ko 25 se 31 siten, aap ko 6 se 12 siten or anya dalon ko 2 se 8 tak siten milane kii gunjaaish rakhi gai he
 The biggest relief for the Congress is that despite the rapid decline in the vote share, the BJP has been able to match it in terms of seats at the election threshold
 panje ko majbootee dene vaali khabar yah he ki mukhyamantri pad kii daavedaari kii 100 ankon kii reating main 40 ankon ke saath mukhyamantri shila dikshit sabase upar hai
 This rating shows that the party's image has been tarnished by the vigorous agitations against the Congress in Delhi in the last two-three years, but the image of Dixit, who is engaged in development works, has not come down
 unki lokapriyata kaa dilachasp pahalu yah he ki umradraj hone ke baavjood ve yuva matadaataaon main khaasi lokapriy hai
 Perhaps one reason for this is that the alphas emanating from their tongues, instead of the political dictionary, emanate from the college-boy dictionary of girls
 duusare number par 21 ankon ke saath arvind kejariwal jame hue hai
 His election symbol of his mission of Chikk Broom political cleansing
 pradesh bijepi adhyaksh vijay goyal is reating main mahaj 12 ank hasil kar tisare number par pade hue hai
 Actually, Goyal's biggest problem is that he has a large clan of opponents within the party
 unke bartaav kii anginat shikaayatein aae din party adhyaksh rajnath singh or dilli ke chunaav prabharee nitin gadakari tak pahunchati rahati hai
 The party is completely confused about the leadership, while there is no question in the Congress
 bijepi ke liye sabase badi chunauti yahi hogi ki ab tak 'aap’ ne congress or bispi ke votaron main acchhee-khaasi send lagaai he or agar kejariwal ko or aage baduya he to baaki ke vot unhen bijepi kii potli se nikaalane honge
 By the way, a surprising fact is that the three parties have made electricity a major issue for the people who spend the most electricity in the country
 jaahir he, aise main chunaav nattejey koi bada jhtka to denge hi
 The style of AAP will change the balance of this fork between BJP and Congress
 is tarah dilli main sahi myne main pehali baar vidhansabha chunaav main trikon dekhne ko milegaa

 Speaking on the Agenda Aaj Tak 2014 platform, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar said that there is a need to respond with a stone to the antics of Pakistan
 ranneeti main ye concept rahegaa
 However, this is not the solution, there are other avenues that the government is working on
 pakistan ke khilaaf modi sarkaar kaa ection jaanane ke liye vahaan ke akhbaar dekhieh amit shaharakshamantri ne kaha ki naugaanv main 14 hajaar feet par maar giraaya tha, wo bhi isi saal aapane dekha

 He talks about the atomic bomb, but we do not talk of full scape war
 ham kis tarah se iskaa jawaab takanicor taur par denge
 We can also do low exercises on this
 ham kah sakate hai gan kaa munh udhar ghuma do
 It is important that no security officer can speak about his weakness
 bolnaa bhi nahi chaiye
 The maximum leakage is from the Ministry of Defense
 maine khud dekha akhbaar main
 i never want to kill a soldier when he is gunning
 gopalpur main ho gaya, to maine unase poocha kisne kaha tha, ham laaparvaahee se bhi apana nuksaan karte hai
 i am the only Defense Minister in the country who has spent 100 hours knowing everything
 unhone kaha ki jab log takanic kii baat karte hai, to main sawaal poochta hum
 There is an advantage of being an engineer
 mujhe pataa hota he ki kahaan kamajori he
 Where is the gap? sansad ke baad ardinance factriyon main jaaoongaa
 Will visit sena main karpshan ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki keval eemaandaar rahanaa hal nahin he
 It is not easy to avoid questions
 is desh main karpshan keval paise kaa hi nahin, balki man kaa bhi hota he
 You have to go to the dirt and clean up the mess
 anthoni kii saaf chhavi kaa matlab ye nahin ki wo kaam bhi aisa kiye
 On the question of one rank one pension, Parrikar said, "when you see recruitment in the army, there is no political agenda going on there
 kai baar chunaav main vaade kiye jate hai, lekin main bhi sabhi kar rahaa hoon puraa pressure daalane vaala hoon
 i try to solve all the problems

 There will be an effort to do 80-90 percent

 In the case of planning, i am knowing as a detail, but it will not happen everywhere
 bajet main jo nayaa daalana hoga
 Army is the biggest asset of the Department of Defense
 unki samasyaon kaa hal karen, to ham is prifer karenge

 There is no final decision on the seat-sharing between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena alliance in the Maharashtra Assembly elections
 mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne ek samay seat shering ke 50-50 formule ko sujhaayaa tha, lekin jammu-kashmir se dhara 370 ko hataae jane ke baad unke sur badal gaye hai
 BJP now wants to contest more assembly seats than Shiv Sena
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki bijepi ke nae seat shering ke formule par shivasena raji hoti he yaa nahin
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, in a special conversation with India Today, has blown away the Shiv Sena's dream of becoming the Chief Minister
 siem ne bijepi or shivasena ke bich seat shering kaa formula sujhaayaa he
 Devendra Fadnavis, while hurting Shiv Sena's expectations, said that BJP will contest more seats than Shiv Sena
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki bijepi maharashtra main bade bhai kii bhoomika main rahanaa chaahati he
 CM Fadnavis said that there is no dispute of any kind between the 122 seats won by BJP and 63 seats of Shiv Sena
 is tarah se donon partiyaan apni-apni siton par chunaav ladengi
 After leaving seats for our three friendly parties, we will divide the remaining seats among ourselves
 saath hi unhone kaha ki is par koi faisla nahin hua he ki bachi hui ye siten baraabar banti jaaengi yaa nahin
 However, the CM said that we will strike a balance between the allies
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ko lekar maharashtra main bahut sakaaratmak maahaul he
 We have to give up some seats for Shiv Sena, we are ready to do this loss but the election will be fought with Shiv Sena itself
 fadanvis ne ye saaf kar diya he ki 288 siton kaa barabari kaa bantwaaraa nahin hone ja rahaa jaisaa ki shivasena daawa kar rahi he
 According to Fadnavis' formula, the seats the BJP will keep with them will be reduced by forty seats in the Shiv Sena's share
 sahyogi choti partiyon ko 12 le 18 siten di jaaengi
 If this happens, BJP will get 160 to 170 seats and Shiv Sena's 110 to 120 seats
 vahiin shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne bijepi ko mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kii ore se siton ke bantwaare ke liye ghoshit 50-50 ke formule kii yaad dilaai he
 Uddhav said on Wednesday that there will be an alliance between Shiv Sena and BJP for the assembly elections
 unhone kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav ke liye gathbandhan ke elaan ke samay vidhansabha chunaav ke liye siton ke bantwaare kaa formula tay ho gaya tha
 The formula was announced by Chief Minister Fadnavis itself
 bataa den ki is saal farvari maheene main shivasena bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav saath ladane kii ghoshnaa kii thi, us din donon dalon kii ore se kaha gaya tha ki satta main donon kii baraabar kii bhagidaari hogi
 Although it would be equal participation, the party did not disclose which party the Chief Minister would be
 iske baad se shivasena ne ye kahana bhi shuru kar diya ki mukhyamantri bhi donon dalon ke baari baari se dhai-dhai saal ke liye banenge
 Like Chief Minister Fadnavis, Uddhav Thackeray's son Aditya Thackeray is also currently visiting Maharashtra
 jise shivasena ke unhen mukhyamantri ummidavaar ke taur par laanch karne kii koshish mana ja rahaa he
 However, Devendra Fadnavis has clearly declared that his name is for the Chief Minister from the alliance, not anyone else
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki fadanvis ke is nae formule par shivasena raji hoti he yaa nahin

 yah modi kii haar hailahar kii tulana tsunami kaa prabhavi prabal hua karata he yah dilli main dikhaai diya
 After Maharashtra, the tsunami water reached Delhi today
 uskaa jhatka bijepi ko laga or unka darun paraabhav hua
 People of BJP feel that this defeat is not of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 yadi yah paraabhav narendra modi kaa nahin he to nishchit taur par kiskaa he? kejariwal jite, phir haara koun? vastav main dilli kii samgr prachaar tantra ko modi ke naam par hi utaara gaya tha
 There was no chance for other leaders
 isliye dilli kaa paraabhav yah modi kaa paraabhav he, aisa anna hajaare ne kaha
 We also have the same opinion
 nakaaratmak prachaar le duubajanata ne modi ke netritv main bhaajapa ko kyon dur kiya? berogari kam nahin hui, mahangaai neeche nahin ai, begharon ko ghar nahin mila, aashwaasano kii purti nahin hui
 All the big leaders of BJP including Modi made fun of Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi in their speeches
 nakaaratmak prachaar kaa jhatka antat unhen laga

 According to a statement issued by the credit rating agency, this downgrade will leave the bank's other ratings unaffected
 bayaan main kaha gaya he, "downgrad is baat kaa akalan karata he ki 2018 ke farvari main jis vittiya gadabadi kaa bhandaphod hua tha, uske kaaran bank kii vittiya sthiti, uski kamai or mukhya puunjikaran prabhavit hogi
 This downgrade reflects the risk control of the bank, which we believe has been weakened by the confidence we previously had
 kyonki dhokhadhadi kai varsho se najar nahin aa rahi thi or bade paimaane par 2
 The $ 2 billion scam was committed
 bank ne kaha he ki vah apane jokhim niyantran ko majboot karne kii yojana bana rahaa he
