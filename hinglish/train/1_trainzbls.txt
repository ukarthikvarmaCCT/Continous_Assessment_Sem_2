 mywlord) onjun 25, 2019 at 9:41pm pdtyaxi nepal ke pradhanmantri capi oli kii sarkaar dwaara sansad main prastaavit kiye gaye vigyaapan (viniman) vidheyak ko lagu kiya jaataa he to videshi channel khaastaur par bhartiya channel vigyapanon ko prasaarit nahin kar paaenge
 On the other hand, Indian broadcasters say that they cannot provide a clean feed to Nepal without advertisements
 bataa den, nepal main star plus, colors, jitivi, soni tivi, star utsav jaise channel behad popular hai
 Nepali viewers like to watch Indian shows for entertainment
 nepal ke logon ke bich kulfi kumaar bajewala, ye rishta kya kehalaata he or da kapil sharma jaise shoj behad popular hai
 Photos of Taimur Ali Khan, son of Kareena Kapoor Khan, are popular on social media
 kai celebs maan chuke hai taimur unase bhi zyada hit he or ab taimur kii daadi sharmila tagore ne bhi kah diya he ki taimur unase zyada femes hai
 Sharmila said this while speaking to India Today in Kolkata
 wo pashchim bengal sarkaar or kolkata police dwaara yojit program main hissaa lene pahunchi thim
 Taimur, who was in Karishma's birthday party, when asked about Mastitaimur doing in Mausi's lap, Sharmila took a dig at the media and said that it was because of her that Timur became a star
 taimur jald pre-skool shuru karne vaala he
 Her photos with classmates were revealed recently
 dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal par apni hi sarkaar ke mantri satyendra jain se do karod rupee kii ghoose lene kaa aarope lagane ke baad aaj tak se baatcheet main aap netaa kapil mishra ne daawa kiya ki satyendra jain agle 10-15 din main jail chale jaaenge
 But some questions are also being raised after this much talked about Kapil Mishra and the sensational allegations
 kapil mishra jis tarah se tanker ghotaale ko lekar shila dikshit par hamalavar rahe hai usase mana ja rahaa tha ki ve tanker ghotaale ko lekar koi khulaasa karenge
 Kapil Mishra had written a letter to the ACB on this issue two days ago, claiming that he had new facts in the tanker scam which he wanted to share with the ACB
 is chitthee ke baad hi kapil mishra ko unke mantripad se barkhaast kar diya gaya
 Kapil Mishra was constantly telling the media that he would not leave the corrupt and those who save him
 ravivaar subah rajghat jane se pehle bhi kapil mishra ne daawa kiya tha ki tanker ghataale main arvind kejariwal se jude kuch logon ke naam hai
 Knowing whom the land will slip from Kejriwal's feet
 kejariwal par aarope lagate rahe hai ki wo tanker ghotaale main shila dikshit par naram rukh apana rahe hai
 Therefore, all the media persons who reached the press conference of Kapil Mishra were also expecting some new revelations in the tanker scam, but Kapil did not talk about it and put a whole new charge on Kejriwal and Satyendar Jain
 kapil ne kejariwal or satyendra par do karod kii ghoose kaa sansanikhej aarope to lagaaya lekin sawaal uth rahe hai ki aakhir tanker ghotaale par unhone koi khulaasa kyon nahin kiya? kapil mishra ne jo aarope lagaae bhi hai unhen bhi sabit karnaa unke liye mushkil hoga
 Questions are arising that at the same time when he saw these two crores of rupees, why not call the Income Tax Department or other agencies and get Kejriwal caught red handed? At the time when this alleged transaction was taking place, was there any fourth person present there who could test it? When Kapil Mishra was asked how he found out that the amount was two crores, he said that Satyendra Jain himself told him that Jain told him how much he owed, but he did not tell where it came from and who Given for work
 sawaal ye bhi uth rahe hai ki kya media main kapil mishra ne jo khulaasa kiya usee ke bare main wo pichley do din se baat kar rahe the yaa antim samay main unhone apni ranneeti badal di? The Government of India has now given the contract for the Red Fort to the Dalmia Group for 5 years for 25 crores
 matlab ye ki ab laal kile kaa rakrakhaav kaa sara ek privet company ko saunp diya gaya he
 Let us tell you, the Red Fort is the most famous ancient building and heritage of the country
 jo puraane dilli main sthit he
 Red Fort is the historical and Mughal period fort of India
 379 saal pehle aaj hi ke din 29 april ko 1639 main isaki neenv rakhi gai thi
 Learn the special things related to the Red Fort - The Red Fort was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the 17th century
 laal kile ko daalamia group ne liya god, ITC ne tajmahal ko maanga- kile kii sanrachana ashtakoniya he
 a high wall was built on the wire side of the fort
 kile main do pravesh dwaar hai
 One Lahori Darwaza and the other Delhi Darwaza
 ye naam lahore or dilli kii taraf khulne ke kaaran rakhe gaye
 Nathuram Godse, the murderer of Mahatma Gandhi, was prosecuted inside the Red Fort
 - laal kila bhi tajmahal kii tarah yamuna nadi ke kinare par bana hua he
 - In 2000, there was a terrorist attack on the Red Fort
 laal kile ko nijee haathon main saunpe jane par laal-pilaa hua vipaksh, sarkaar ne di safai- 22 disambar 2000 ko laal kile par aatanki sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba ke aatankiyon ne hamalaa kiya tha
 - Lashkar terrorists fired indiscriminately
 jisamen 3 jawan kii maut ho gai thi
 - The Red Fort was earlier known as 'fort-i-mubarak'
 - laal kile ko aakaar or khubsuurati dene main takreeban 10 saal kaa samay laga tha

 Jamiat chief met Mohan Bhagwat, talks on hindu-muslim unity rabart wadra ke jameen kharid-farokht maamle par hangaamaa much gaya he
 BJP has demanded an inquiry into the entire matter
 is maasle paramangalvaar ko sansad ke dono sadanon main jabardast hangaamahua tha
 After which the House had to adjourn
 mana ja rahaa he ki vipaksh is mudde ko aaj buudhvaar ko bhi sansad main jor shor se uthayega
 Currently, there is no explanation from Robert Vadra in this matter
 jabaki sansadaay kaary rajyamantri rajeev shukla kaa kahana he ki rabart wadra kii company ne deal main koi gadabadi nahin kii he
 Congress leader Renuka Chaudhary has also come out in defense of Robert Vadra
 unka kahana he ki kisi ke vyaktigat maamle ko sansad main nahin uthaanaa chahie
 What is the whole matter The whole matter is related to Robert Vadra and his company
 wadra ne faridabad jameen ke chaar deal kiye
 The first deal was on 12 September on 12 acres of land for Rs 32 lakh
 duusari deal 14 april 2006 ko robert wadra ne paahwa se hi 30 lakh rupee main or das acre jameen kharidi
 Third Deal - On January 13, Vadra bought 19 acres of land in Amipur village from Harbans Lal Pahwa
 is baar 54 lakh rupee main or chauthi deal 28 april 2006 ko wadra kii patni priyanka gandhi ne amipur gaanv main hi paahwa se 5 acre jameen kaa sauda 15 lakh rupee main kiya
 This is not only a violation of the Land Ceiling Act, but Vadra sold the land of Harbansh Lal Pahwa to a person with considerable profits
 ab rajasthan main bhi jameen kaa khelaharyana ke baad ab rajasthan main bhi wadra ke jameen kaa khel saamne aayaa he
 Here Robert Vadra's company Real Earth also has many screws in the land purchase case
 robert wadra par aarope he ki rajasthan ke bikaner jile main jameen kharidne ke liye unhone kanoon todaa he
 The issue of Robert Vadra's land purchase raises a serious question that for him the Rajasthan government even changed the land law
 robert wadra ne land ceiling act main sanshodhan se thik pehle saikadon acre jameen kharidi thi
 But Aaj Tak has highlighted the case of four such transactions in which 321
 78 acre jameen kharidi gai
 However, according to the law, only 175 acres of land could be purchased
 iske alaava jameen kharid ke do saal baad hi isi ilaake main rajasthan sarkaar ne solar project shuru karne kaa prastaav rakhaa
 After which the price of land here increased significantly and Vadra's company made a lot of profit

 Ajay Chaudhary and his friends have seen the rise of Narendra Modi in the BJP with great enthusiasm
 har subah safadarajang hawaii adde ke paas chaar baag main aresas kii shakha main kasarat ke baad ve ghanton tak chaay pite hue adarsh bharat kii apni soch par charchaa karte rahe hai
 This echo of his thinking is heard in the form of India being told in Modi's speeches - a country in which everyone is developed and nobody is appeased
 sitambar, 2013 main bijepi ne jab modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya to doston kaa yah jhund pradhanmantri ke rup main modi ke liye samarthan jutaney laga
 Chaudhary explains, “we went from house to house campaigning for Modi for weeks before voting in Delhi on April 10
 mujhe nahin yaad padataa ki jab 1991 main adwani ji ne chunaav ladaa tha, uske baad se hamane kabhi bijepi ke liye itani mehnat kii he
 This time we have voted for Modi
 ” choudhary kaa maananaa he ki modi pradhanmantri bane to, “samaan aachaar samhita lagu hogi or muslim ladakon se pyaar karne par hindu ladakiyon ko islam nahin apnaanaa padegaa
 "hundreds of miles away from here in Mumbai, a senior official at the India office of a leading investment banking and management company in the world said that Congress and BJP no longer represent the business world, only Modi does
 unki raay main korporate jagat kii najar main bijepi nahin balki modi arthvyavastha main badlaav laaenge
 He also says that foreign institutional investors are excited about the possibility that Modi will become the next Prime Minister of India and bjp's leader of isolation
 donon hi maamalon main ummiden aasmaan chhu rahi hai
 “the market has saluted the surveys which projected the formation of a government under Modi and the market situation has improved
 lekin korporate jagat kii yah bhi apeksha he ki is saal 15 agast ko apni sarkaar ke lagbhag teen maah puure hone tak modi dikhne laayak parivartan karne lagenge
 "modi's speech in one man's party BJPJP: The prime ministerial candidate of BJP has started Modiizing the party
" dilli main matdaan ke din akhabaaron main chape puure pej ke vigyapanon main chhapi modi kii tasviir ne daawa kiya tha, “bijepi ummidavaar ke liye aapkaa vot mere liye vot he
 “there has been no one-man election in the country since 1971
 1971 main prachaar indira gandhi par kendrit tha, jab unhone “garibi hataao” kaa naaraa diya tha
 Modi's slogan in this election is - Congress mukt Bharat
 modi ke vishwast or uttar pradesh main party ke unke sipahasaalar amit shah kaa kahana tha, “desh kii janata ne to party kaa aupchaarik ummidavaar ghoshit hone se pehle hi modi ko pradhanmantri chunane kaa man bana liya tha
 "this campaign is not only presidential-style and personality-focused, but Modi's rise in this election is also changing the form of BJP which has been under the NDA and UPA in the last 16 years
 atal bihari vaajapeyi or laalkrishna adwani ke baad kaa yug shuru ho chukaa he
 For most of the states and most of the key posts, Modi's own loyalists have been fixed, which are creating a new form of BJP
 uttar pradesh main shah ke alaava gujarat main cabinet mantri anandi ben patel, orissa or bihar main party mahasachiv dharmendra pradhan or dakshini rajyon main muralidhar raav kuch pramukh vafaadaar hai
 Most of the leaders in the BJP are standing behind Modi, except for some leaders who crave the Prime Minister's mind
 modi ke sangrakshak adwani, party ke purv adhyaksh murali manohar joshi or varisht netaa jaswant singh jaise anya netaaon ko kathor tewaron or nishkasana (jaswant singh) kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa he
 On April 13, Joshi told Manorama News, "modi is the party's representative as the prime ministerial candidate
 isliye yah behad vyaktigat nahin balki pratinidhi lahar he
 They symbolize the mood of the public and the desire to change
 ” joshi ko na sirf agle din apane vaktavy par spashtikaran dene ke liye majaboor kiya gaya, balki do din baad jab ve kanpur main bijepi ke kaarykram main kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karne lage to modi samarthak unhen bolne se rokane ke liye har-har modi, ghar-ghar modi ke naare lagane lage
 Eventually Joshi had to leave
 isse pehle joshi ko varanasi se ukhadkar kanpur bheja gaya, taaki modi purvi uttar pradesh kii kisi seat se chunaav lard saken
 The way Indira Gandhi shied away at the almighty syndicate in the Congress
 usee tarah modi ne is chunaav main un logon kaa mahatv kam kar diya he, jo unke pichhalggu nahin bane
 Earlier, the party had never knelt quietly before a man
 narendra modi ke sangrakshak or hindutv ke asli nayak laalkrishna adwani ko bhi us samay se mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, jab unhone aapatti kii thi ki bijepi modi ke liye sarvasammati kaa rasta chhod rahi he
 In May 2013, Advani did not join the party's national executive in Goa to halt Modi's appointment as the head of the party's campaign committee
 jawaab main dilli main prithviraj road par adwani ke ghar ke baahar unke virodh main naare lagane vaale or poster uthaae pradarshnkaree jamaa ho gaye or udhar, goa main party adhyaksh rajnath singh ke saath rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne sansadeey board se is niyukti par apni muhar lagava lee
 He had argued that the party leadership could not ignore the organization's demand to make Narendra Modi the prime ministerial candidate
 adwani ke vipareet rajnath nae halaat main apni takat or party main apni haisiyat badhaane main kaamyaab rahe
 He introduced himself as a disciplined soldier of the party
 isiilie ve modi ke baad duusare number par hai
 Recently, the party forced Advani to reverse his decision to change his constituency from Gandhinagar in Gujarat to Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh
 adwani is baat se naaraaz the ki modi or rajnath to apni pasand kii siten hadap rahe hai, lekin joshi or calraj mishra jaise varisht netaaon ko unki siton se dhakel rahe hai
 Advani loyalist Harin Pathak was denied a ticket from Ahmedabad East
 joshi or adwani ne 2009 main pathak ko tikat dene par modi kii apattiyaan khaarij kar di thim
 This time, both the former party presidents are at the mercy of Modi and they are no longer able to decide their constituency
 agar bijepi ne congress ko baari antar se haraa diya or modi ke netritv main endie sarkaar centre kii satta main aa gai, to narendra modi ke udai ke saath aresas ke samarthan se bijepi main jo badlaav aae hai, ve pathar kii lakeer ho jaaenge
 The rise of power outside the new system: Modi's rise within the BJP is the result of many such internal battles that did not allow the party to become a serious challenge to the Congress in 2004 and 2009
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main party kii lagaataar duusari haar ke baad aresas ne kalah main uljhi party kii bagdor sanbhali
 He ended the supremacy of the Delhi faction called D4, in which LK Advani's special people were Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Anant Kumar and M
 venkaiya naidu shaamil the
 The RSS divided the parliamentary and organizational functions of party leaders
 sushamaa swaraj loksabhaa main or arun jetali rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa bane, to march, 2009 main sangh ke nae sarasang chaalak bane mohan bhagwat ne disambar, 2009 main apane vishwast nitin gadakari ko party adhyaksh kii kursi par bitha diya
 Though the businessman of Nagpur and former Maharashtra minister Nitin Gadkari had a small political stature, this was the rss's way to rein in the BJP
 aresas kii chaalon ke samanaantar modi apana jaal bicha rahe the
 With the Gujarat model of good governance and bjp's success in the state, he started dreaming of the throne of Delhi with the help of noise
 gadakari kaa kaarykaal or vyaktitv feekaa rahaa or hindutv ke majboot pratik ke rup main kaaryakartaaon kii talash modi par jaakar khatm hui
 By January 2013, Gadkari became embroiled in the corruption of his companies and was replaced by Rajnath Singh, who was the Sangh's second choice
 narendra modi gujarat main lagaataar teesraa chunaav jeet gaye or unki nazren dilli par jam gayi
 Advani's attempts to become party president again found no support from the RSS, which removed him in 2005
 kaaryakartaaon ke bich modi ke prati apaar samarthan ne sangh ko na sirf unki ummidavaari sweekaar karne, balki majbootee se unhen samarthan dene par baadhya kar diya (dekhen box)
 Narendra Modi took a heavy seat on the parliamentary board of 12 members of the party, including big leaders and till recently he has taken all the major decisions on his own
 pichley kuch maheenon main adwani, sushamaa swaraj or joshi jaise varisht netaaon ne is baat kaa virodh kiya he ki modi kis tarah apane faislon par sarvasammati liye bina rajnath singh ke jariye unhen board par thopate rahe hai
 The results have also come to light when the protest is public
 super vikalpamodi ke chune hue ummidavaarabijepi ne is chunaav main jitne ummidavaar utaare hai, unamem se kareeb 15 pratishat ekadam bahari yaa duusari partiyon se aae hai
 a party general secretary says, "if indeed there is a wave of Narendra Modi, then a lot of these candidates should win
" agar aisa hua to bijepi sansadeey dal main bahut bade hisse kii vafadari sidhe modi ke prati hogi, kisi anya party netaa yaa ikai ke prati nahin
 This entire election has been confined to Modi
 agar yah formula kaamyaab rahaa, to modi ko vaisaa virodh nahin jhelana padegaa, jaisaa unase pehle kai bade netaaon ko jhelana padaa he
 "seven-time MP Harin Pathak had to leave the seat for Modi's favorite and film actor Paresh Rawal
" shuru main rawal kaa kuch jagahon par virodh hua lekin baad main is virodh ko dabaa diya gaya or sab kuch shant ho gaya
 Meenakshi Lekhi, who was pitted against former Union Minister Ajay Maken in New Delhi, is not a relatively well-known face in politics but is a firm loyalist of Modi
 agar modi kii lahar kaam kar gai to unhen har shaam tivi studio kii charchaaon main namo-namo japane kaa inaam mil jayega
 More than one-third of bjp's 26 candidates in Gujarat have come from Congress
 inamen surendra nagar se purv vidhayak devji bhai fatahpura or porbandar se ummidavaar prabhu bhai vaasava shaamil hai, jo vidhayaki se istipha dekar tikat milane se maheenaa bhar pehle hi bijepi main shaamil hue the
 In Uttar Pradesh, BJP has given tickets to more than two dozen outside leaders, including four of Baba Ramdev's candidates
 dumriyaganj (congress ke jagdambika paal) or gonda (samaajawaadee party ke kirti vardhan singh) ke vartmaan saansad bijepi ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe hai

 He realizes that Modi's strategy succeeds to a large extent and if the party comes to power, eventually he too will benefit
 bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke samarthan or peeth par aresas ke haath ke bal par modi ne bijepi ko kam bojhil or chaalaak banane kaa silsilaa shuru kar diya he
 This new BJP is less dependent on 11 Ashoka Road in the 2014 election
 nitin gadakari kii party adhyaksh pad par niyukti ke samay aresas mukhyalay nagpur ahm ho gaya tha or pichley saal gandhinagar kaa palada baari ho gaya
 Even before Modi became the prime ministerial candidate, his loyalist Amit Shah was sent to Uttar Pradesh as the party's state in-charge general secretary
 idhar, modi desh ke liye vikaas kaa gujarat model bechney or use nae-nae tareekon se pesh karne main lage rahe
 On the other hand, Shah brought the Gujarat model of Hitech Management of elections to Uttar Pradesh
 unhone rajya main ummidavaaron ke chayan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 Not only this, the campaign campaign of the party was also prepared very neatly and instead of giving a public speech, he focused on meeting the key people of the area
 isse jahaan unka sthaneey logon se sidhaa sampark hua, vahiin unka yah tarika zyada kargar rahaa kyonki sthaneey netaa neeche tak unka sandesh pahunchaa dete hai
 The RSS deployed Sunil Bansal, former organization secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), and Sangh's joint general secretary Krishna Gopal to help Shah and oversee the operation
 2009 main bijepi ko rajya main 80 main se 10 loksabhaa siton par jeet mili thi
 This time the goal of this team is to win 50 seats
 upi ke nattejey is drushti se kaaphi ahm ho jate hai
 The second model of Gujarat, with the rise of Dagamodi, the shrinking of disagreement, has also marked the beginning of an era which uses technology and management techniques to increase political power
 phir bhi bijepi ke andar modi ke udai kii vajah se bechaini bhi bahut zyada he
 Because of that it is not difficult to understand
 modi kii raajnneeti main asahmati ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 a senior BJP leader says, "there is another model of Gujarat that everyone fears
" narendra modi ne purv mukhyamantriyon keshubhai patel, suresh mehta or kai anya netaaon kaa rajnatik safar khatm kar diya
 "modi also joined hands with the Sangh in the state by not giving tickets to former state home minister Haren Pandya in the 2002 assembly elections
" ek jamaane main apane sahyogi or baad main aankh kii kirakiri bane sanjay joshi se bhi baar-baar takkar lee or aakhirkaar 2012 main unhen bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini se istipha dene par majaboor kar diya gaya
 In 1995, the BJP government was formed in Gujarat for the first time and Keshubhai Patel became the Chief Minister
 modi tab bijepi ke rashtriya sachiv the
 He was sent to the party with Joshi in 1987 and dominated the state of Gujarat
 shankar singh waghela ne patel sarkaar main modi ke dabadabe par aapatti kii or party kaa vibhaajan kar diya
 When Patel became chief minister again in 1998, he asked Advani to send Modi to Delhi as the organization's general secretary, but Joshi himself remained in Gujarat
 modi ne gujarat se nikaale jane ke liye patel or joshi ko kabhi maaf nahin kiya
 Pravin Togadia, acting president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and representative of the Sangh, was also very powerful during Patel's tenure
 2001 main modi mukhyamantri ke rup main gujarat laute to togdipha ne 2002 ke chunaav main bijepi kaa samarthan kiya
 In Modi's second term, the VHP and BJP avenues diverged in the state
 viechpi rajya main hindutv ke agenda par jor dena chaahati thi or modi vikaas ke raste par baduya chaahate the
 In this way, he not only ignored Togadia but made him a secondary figure in the politics of the state
 sanjay joshi kaa chadhataa kariyar graph achaanak us samay ruk gaya, jab 2005 main mumbai main bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak se thik pehle ek sex sidi saamne aa gai, jisamen joshi kathith rup se shaamil the
 Nitin Gadkari became the party president, Joshi returned and started working in Uttar Pradesh
 lekin may, 2012 main modi ne bijepi kii puri gujarat ikai se bahishkaar kii dhamkee dilava di
 Sanjay Joshi had to leave the national executive
 modi aasaani se maaf nahin karte hai or na hi koi baat bhoolatey hai
 They also do not tolerate indiscipline
 july, 2010 main fees badaye jane ke virodh main abivipi ke andolan ke dauraan gujarat vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati ke ghar main ghusane ke baad chaatr netaa pakade gaye
 It is said that at that time Modi took help from the Sangh and ended the agitation on the promise of taking action on the demands in 15 days
 lekin maangen kabhi puri nahin huin
 On the contrary, the way Modi ran Gujarat, his economic vision for India can be seen
 chhattisgarh main party kii sarkaar ke khaadya suraksha kaarykram ke upie ke kaarykram se behatar hone ke party ke daawey ke baavjood modi khayraat baantne ke khilaaf hai
 Experts say that in their model, the government will act as an aid to investment and private enterprise will be promoted more
 party ne upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan retail main epadi par apana rukh badla he or kalabaji khai he
 But it seems that Modi will be more market-driven and will focus on reforms, bringing the bjp's economic vision back to the right, just as Margaret Thatcher did in England with the Conservative Party
 sangh kii mul aasthaaen modi ke netritv main endie ke liye sir dard jarur banengi
 If the BJP needs fewer allies to form and run the government, the RSS will exert tremendous pressure to implement its agenda, ranging from altering the history books to abolishing Article 370 and implementing the Uniform Code of Conduct
 lekin modi is maamle main sangh se alag ravaiya apana sakate hai
 They will advance their agenda of good governance and development
 modi jis badlaav kaa sapana dikhaa rahe hai, vah upie kii niti shoonyata se khud ko thaga hua mahasoos kar rahe lakhon logon ko bhale hi lubhaa le, lekin swayamsevakon kii us fouj ko nahin rijh paaegaa jo swadeshi or sade jivan ke sankalp ke saath unka chunaav prachaar kar rahe hai
 If the latest history of the Sangh Parivar in Gujarat is any proof, then it may be that the Sangh will have to change its demand letter soon

 The ministers, who were dismissed from the cabinet by Akhilesh Yadav as Shivpal Yadav camp, all managed to get tickets
 om prakaash singh, naarad raay, ambika choudhary, shaadaab fatima, shiv kumaar beria, rajakishor singh, aridaman singh, rajakishor singh or yogesh pratap singh in sabhi purv mantriyon ko tikat mil gaya he
 Sitapur MLA Rampal Yadav was removed from the party by Akhilesh Yadav on charges of hooliganism
 do din pehle hi unhen party main vaapis laakar shivpal yadav ne tikat de diya he
 When his people were ignored in the ticket distribution, Akhilesh Yadav said that those who have not got the ticket at his behest, will ask Mulayam Singh Yadav to reconsider
 lekin itnaa saaf he ki tikat bantwaare ko lekar ek baar phir chachaa bhattije kii ladai saamne aa gayi he
 It is to see what Akhilesh signs to his people now
 ram govind choudhary, arvind singh gop or pawan pandey akhilesh se milane pahunche, teenon ko nahin mila tikat
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav himself said that he would like to contest from any seat of Bundelkhand
 lekin jin siton kii ghoshnaa hui usamen akhilesh yadav kaa naam nahin he
 When asked about Akhilesh Yadav contesting elections, Mulayam Singh Yadav only said that he can contest from wherever he wants

 Senior BJP leader LK Advani is not happy with some party mps joining RJD chief Lalu Prasad and SP chief Mulayam Singh in an attempt to conduct a dramatic Lok Sabha session and Gopinath Munde has been reprimanded for this
 shuukravaar ko ‘mock parliament’ chalaane ke prasad or yadav ke prayaas main shaamil hue munde, kirti aaazaad, menka gandhi or unke putr varun tathaa anya bhaajapa saansadon se adwani khush nahin hai kyonki kai muddon par party rajd or sapa kii dhur virdohi he
 BJP sources said that running a dramatic session like this is an insult to the Parliament and that participation in such an effort does not suit the main opposition party
 adwani ne loksabhaa main bhaajapa ke upanetaa munde ko fatkaar lagaayi he kyonki vah naatakeey satr chalaane ke liye prasad se sahamat ho gayi the
 In this show, where Munde became the Lok Sabha Speaker, Azad became the Leader of the Opposition

 ' likhane vaala yah geetkaar aaj 80 baras kaa ho gaya he
 
 
 It is also surprising to think that even at this age, Gulzar's songs have youthfulness to beat the youngsters, leave behind new age and have the talent to achieve new goals for themselves
 
 
 sach to yah he ki zaar-zaar rone or jor-jor se hansane vaali har baat ko, har jazbe ko atinaatakeey oonchaaiyon tak le jane vaali mumbaiya filmon main gulzaar ek aise shaks kii tarah aae, jise maaloom tha ki khamoshi bhi bolti he, ki behate hue aansuon se zyada takaleef palkon par tehre moti paidaa karte hai, rulaaiyon se zyada asardaar bhinche hue hothon ke peeche chhipaae hue dukh hote hai
 
 
 Actually, Gulzar gave way to Hindi films by saying less
 
 
 jis duniya main har film pyaar ke kaarobaar par tiki hoti he, kadam-kadam par mohabbat ke nagame gaae jate hai, ishk ke elaan kiye jate hai, vahaan ek laharaati hui awaz israar karti he - 'pyaar koi bol nahin, pyaar awaz nahin, ek khaamoshi he, sunati he, kaha karti he
 
 
 ' nur kii boond kii tarah sadiyon se sabhyataaon ko roshan karne vaali mohabbat kii yah shamaa jab gulzaar ne thami to paravaanon ko jalaane kaa khel peeche chhot gaya or logon ne dekhi samandar main parachhaaiyaan banaati, paniyon ke chhinte udaati or laharon par aati-jaati wo ladki, jo bahut haseen nahin he, lekin apni maasoom adaaon main behad dilkash he
 
 
 When Gulzar came, he brought new art and new depth of relationship
 
 
 unke gaanon main chand tarah-tarah kii poshaaken pahanakar aata he, naina sapane banjar kar dete hai or bataate hai ki jitna dekhoge, utana dukh paaoge
 
 
 Love is not just physical here, it becomes spiritual
 
 
 unke geeton main vakt ek udhaas nayak kii tarah tahalta dikhaai detaa he
 
 
 Years later, a lost couple suddenly returns to their past, where there are 'night-days of leisure' and 'mild heat of love', but most of all it is the call, not outside, inside Descends

 After the Lok Sabha elections 2014, the Congress has also suffered a humiliating defeat in 2019
 rahul gandhi kii aguwai main congress party ne kul 543 loksabhaa main se 421 siton par chunaav ladaa, lekin 369 siton par haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The way Rahul started visiting temples after the Gujarat assembly elections, he was beginning to speculate that the Congress was returning to the model of soft Hindutva
 aise main ab jab chunaav nateezon ke sabhi aankade saamne hai, to congress ke graph par ek nazar daalate hai
 The Congress contested 421 seats this time, winning only 52 seats
 196 siton par congress duusare or 173 siton par tisare yaa usase bhi nichle paaydaan par rahi
 Of the total 52 mps of the Congress, 60 per cent come from only three states, which are Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Punjab
 yani teenon hi non hindi rajya hai
 On one hand, the BJP managed to get more than 50 per cent vote share in 17 states, while the Congress could only do such a feat in Puducherry
 yahaan congress party ko 56
 Got 3 percent of the vote
 kin rajyon main congress ne paaya sammanjanak vot- congress ko sirf saat rajyon main hi 40 se adhik fisadi vot mila he
 These include Meghalaya (48
 3), nagaland (48
 1), Lakshadweep (46
 9), andaman-nicobar (46), goa (42
 9), Chandigarh (40
 9) or punjab (40
 1)
 - jis kerala main congress ne sarvaadhik 15 siten jiti hai, vahaan use sirf 37
 Got 3% votes
 assam main jahaan party ko teen siten mili hai vahaan par 35
 Got 4 percent votes
 kya kehete hai aankade?- jin aath rajyon main congress ko sammanjanak vot mila he, vahaan non hindu voter sabase zyada hai
 - Congress got the highest votes in Meghalaya, Nagaland, 90% of the voters are Christians
 - lakshadweep main kareeb 95 fisadi voter muslim samudaay se hai
 - In Goa, where the Congress wins, there are more number of Christians and Muslims, whereas the BJP where it wins, there is 76 percent Hindu population
 inhen rajyon kii tarah punjab, chandigarh or andaman nicobar main bhi isi tarah kaa trend dikh rahaa he
 Failure of soft Hindutva failed? Let us tell you that the process of going to temples started during the Gujarat elections this time lasted till the Lok Sabha elections
 phir chaahe vah congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi hon yaa phir mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra, donon ne hi puure prachaar ke dauraan mandir-mandir maathaa teka or soft hindutv kii chhavi ko ujagar kiya

 dalit ladke kii kathith mahila mitra ne police main ulte yah shikaayat darj kara di he ki naukari dilaane ke bahaane ladkaa use dilli le gaya tha jahaan uske saath balaatkaar bhi kiya gaya
 The case is such that a Dalit boy of Baghpat district was caught in Delhi with a Jat girl in the last days of last month
 ladki shaadishuda thi
 His family accused the Dalit boy of tricking the girl
 chunki ladki ne us vakt is tarah kaa koi bayaan nahin diya tha, isliye police ne ladke par apharan kaa mukaadama darj karne ke bajaay use narkotics act main jail bhej diya
 The boy's sister has now reached the Supreme Court

 The Jat girl has complained to the SP of Baghpat district that the Dalit boy had seduced her to Delhi, where he raped her

 On the other hand the people of the boy's house are saying that the girl is lying and why she did not give this statement when the police brought her from Delhi

 kupwada jile ke machhil sector main niyantran rekha par 22 november ko ek jawan ke shav ko kshat-vikshat karne ke maamle main sena ko nite vijan divaais mila he jisamen 'america sarkari sampatti' kii muhar lagi hui he
 This gives a clear indication of the involvement of the Pakistani army in the Machil incident
 ullekhneey he ki 22 november ko machhil sector main gasht laga rahi tukdi par ghuspaithiyon ne ghaat lagaakar hamalaa kiya tha jisamen teen jawan maare gaye or inamen se ek jawan prabhu singh ke shav ko kshat-vikshat kiya gaya tha
 Senior officials of the Indian Army told NDTV that this night vision device is likely to be provided by the US government to the Pak military to counter terrorists along the Afghanistan border
 mana jaataa he ki inamen se kuch divaais pakistan border ection team ke sadasyon ko die gaye jinhone 22 november kii ghatana ko anjaam diya
 This is not the first time that 'US government property' stamped devices have been recovered during an anti-terrorism operation in Kashmir
 machhil sector main pichley saal tainaat rahe ek adhikari ne enditivi ko bataaya ki unki team ko bhi isi tarah ke divaais tab mili the, jab unhone ek encounter main 4 aatankiyon ko maar giraaya tha
 Apart from the night vision device, there are several indications that Pakistan had a 'direct role' in this attack
 hamale ke baad machhil se baraamad hue ek medical gej main "pakistan raksha bal" kaa mark bana hua he jabaki dawaaon main lahore, karachi or multan kii marking mili he
 In addition, tactical radio sets, ammunition, wire cutters, food supplies, binoculars and sleeping bags have been recovered
 bharat or pakistani sena ke sheersh cmanderon ke hui baithak ke baad, 23 november ko bhartiya sena ne apane bayaan main niyantran rekha ke paas aatankiyon dwaara bhartiya jawan ke shav ko 'kshat-vikshat' karne ke maamle ko aniatik karrwai qaraar diya tha
 Army officials told NDTV that there was no doubt that the 'terrorists' were not members of the Pakistan Border Action Team
 border ection team main khoonkhaar zehadi, pakistani sena ke ritred commando or pakistani sena ke special sarvice group commando ke sadsy shaamil rahete hai jo aksar team ke anya sadasyon ko oparation ke sambandh main disha-nirdesh or vishesh lakshith input dete hai
 After the Uri attack and surgical strikes on terror camps in Pakistan by India, despite ceasefire between India and Pakistan, the ceasefire violations between the two countries' DGMO (director General of Military Operations) last week led to no The incident has not been revealed
 nite vijan divaais ke alaava, aise kai sanket milte hai jinase pataa chalata he ki is hamale main pakistan kii 'sidhi bhoomika' thi
 a medical gauge recovered from Machil after the attack remains the mark of the "pakistan Defense Force", while drugs have the markings of Lahore, Karachi and Multan
 iske alaava samrik radio set, gola-barood, vir kattar, bhojan saamagree, doorabeen or sleeping bag baraamad hue hai
 Following a meeting of top commanders of the Indian and Pakistani Army, on 23 November, the Indian Army in its statement termed the case of 'mutilating' the bodies of an Indian jawan by terrorists near the Line of Control
 sena ke adhikariyon ne enditivi se baatcheet main bataaya ki isamen koi andeh nahin ki 'aatankwaadi' pakistan border ection team ke sadsy nahin the
 The Border Action Team consists of the dreaded Zehadi, retired commandos of the Pakistani Army and members of the Pakistan Army's Special Service Group Commandos who often give directions and specific targeted input regarding the operation to other members of the team
 udi hamale or bharat dwaara pakistan ke aatanki campon par sargical strike kiye jane ke baad, bharat or pakistan ke bich jari tanaav ke baavjood, donon deshon ke dijiemo (diarector general of military oparation) ke bich pichley saptaah hui baithak ke baad sangharshaviram ulanghan ko koi ghatana saamne nahin ai he
 The Supreme Court refused to hear the plea seeking consideration of the reservation given to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and the exclusion of castes which had been quashed
 supreme court ne kaha ki ye maamla maanavadhikaar ke ulanghan kaa nahin he isliye ise suna nahin ja saktaa
 On this, the petitioner withdrew his petition
 darasal opi shukla naam ke yachikakarta ne supreme court main janhit yachika daakhil kar kaha tha ki lokur cameti ne apni report main kaha tha ki vaqt vaqt par esaysi-esasti ke tahat aarakshan paane vaali jatiyon kii samiksha kii jaani chahie lekin sarkaron ne aisa nahin kiya
 This is the reason why many castes are continuously taking advantage of reservation
 yachika main kuch jatiyon kaa hawala bhi diya gaya he or kaha gaya he in jatiyon main kai ko aarakshan ab jarurat nahin he
 Hence they should be removed from the quota and new castes should be included in this reservation quota
 iske liye centre sarkaar or sabhi rajya sarkaron ko party banaaya gaya tha
 However, the Supreme Court said that it would not hear this petition
 agar yachikakarta chaahe to is yachika ko waapas le saktaa he
 The petition was withdrawn on this
 gauratlab he ki jat samudaay ko obisi cote main mili aarakshan ko radd karte vakt supreme court ne kaha tha ki sarkaar nai jatiyon ko shaamil to kar rahi he, lekin kisi ko baahar nahin kar rahi he

 The politics of Madhya Pradesh has come to a boil due to the incident of assault and assault of Jain Sadhvi on March 20 in Chambal region
 yah maamla rajnatik dalon ke liye isliye mahatvapurn he kyonki gwalior-chambal sahit bundelkhand main bhi jain samudaay kii sankhya acchhee-khaasi he
 Bhind district alone has a population of about three lakhs of this community
 itane bade vot bank ko koi khona nahin chahta, vah bhi aise samay main jab vidhansabha chunaav itane najadik hon
 This is the reason that leaders of various parties keep getting angry for inquiring about the Sadhvi admitted in Gwalior Medical College
 chambal ke mau kasbe kii rahane vaali or dhai saal pehle sadhvi baniin yuvati komal jain (naam badla hua) 20 march ko parijanon se milane pahunchi thim
 Meanwhile, Sadhvi kidnapped Sadhvi and tried to rape her at night during the night with the help of neighbor Ashok Dhobi
 sadhvi ne baraabar pratikaar kiya
 When the miscreants failed to succeed in their intentions, they beat up Sadhvi badly and threw her out of the house in a moribund condition
 police mukhya aaropee ko ab tak giraftaar nahin kar pai he
 Since the incident, people of Jain community in Bhopal including Bhind, Gwalior have been continuously protesting
 sadhvi ke taaoo kaa aarope he ki yah koi bada shadyantr he or isamen kuch dabang log bhi shaamil hai
 This accident has given the Congress an opportunity to target the BJP government of the state
 kendriya rgramin vikaas rajyamantri pradeep jain ne sadhvi ke saath hue haadase ko lekar rajya sarkaar ko jamkar kosa
 Taking a dig at the police and the administration, he says, "though the police also catch unknown criminals but in this case, the named crooks have not been able to catch them either
 yah keval ek samaaj kaa nahin, balki sabhi santon kaa apmaan he
 '' Congress leader Dr
 govind singh bhi pradesh sarkaar par sawaal uthaate hue poochhate hai, ‘‘ab to pradesh main sadhu-sant bhi surakshit nahin hai
 In such a situation, what should the general public expect from the state government and the police? ”in this case, the BJP government became more cautious as the Congress attack increased
 ab pradesh ke chikitsa shiksha mantri anup mishra vyaktigat rup se sadhvi kii sehat kii jaankaree le rahe hai
 Apart from him, BJP state president Narendra Singh Tomar and other leaders are also coming to know about Sadhvi's health
 jain samudaay bijepi ke liye kitna mahatvapurn he, iskaa andaja isse bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bhind ke ek netaa ravisen jain ne party se vidroh kar diya tha
 The central leadership then sent Rajiv Pratap Rudy to persuade Jain
 police ko bhi andaja nahin tha ki maamla itnaa tool pakad legaa, isiilie usne pehle marpet kaa hi maamla darj kiya tha
 When all-round pressure came, a case of kidnapping and misconduct was also registered
 badmaashon ne sadhvi ko itani berahami se peeta ki unke haath or pair kii haddi tut gai he
 At present, the police have arrested two women, including Sadhvi's neighbor

 The matinee show (3 pm to 6 pm) of the film 'border' was in its final stages, and the hall was packed at the Upaz Cinemahall, Green Park, New Delhi
 
 
 tabhi haul ke ek kone se dhuaan nikalnaa shuru hua, or dekhte hi dekhte aag ne puure haul ko chapet main le liya
 
 
 59 people were killed in it by scorching or suffocating, and more than 100 were also injured in the stampede

 It is said that after the fire, the doors of the cinema hall were closed by the managers, and seats were also placed in the hall where the emergency exit was supposed to take place
 
 
 lekin ab ansal bhaaiyon ko jail nahin janaa hoga
 
 
 Both will only have to pay a fine of Rs 30-30 crore, and this amount of Rs 60 crore is to be deposited in three months, but the families of the victims are asking if these 60 crores are worth the lives of 59 people

 But now the Ansal brothers will not have to go to jail

 In the midst of the ongoing discussion about Sachin Tendulkar's retirement, former Indian captain Anil Kumble strongly criticized the people questioning the place of this star batsman in the team
 unhone kaha ki tendulkar kii bhaawanaaon kii kadra kii jaani chahie
 Tendulkar has been in poor form for a long time and many people have questioned his place in the Indian team, but Kumble said that it is time to support him, not to point fingers at him
 kumble ne 'wyk' patrika main apane kollam main likhaa, kai aise maukey the, jabaki unhone akele bharat ko jeet dilaai, lekin vah bharat kii haar ke ekmaatr kaaran kabhi nahin rahe
 It would be better to let them deal with what is in front of them, because no one can take their place
 kisi ne ab tak 192 test match nahin khele hai, 34 hajaar ran nahin banaae hai yaa 100 shatak nahin lagaae hai
 Give him the respect he deserves
 tippaniyan He has written, in the last 23 years, he helped in realizing people's dreams
 unhen bhaavnaatmak rup se behatar mahasoos karaayaa
 Now we should also appreciate their feelings
 unhone kaha ki keval tendulkar hi nahin, balki puri team bure daur se guzar rahi he tathaa yah kahana puri tarah galat hoga ki yah team tendulkar kii kharaab form ke kaaran bura pradarshan kar rahi he
 Kumble said, for the first time people are questioning his place in the team
 kaha ja rahaa he ki unhen sanyas le lenaa chahie, kyonki pichley saal yaa haal main unka pradarshan vaisaa nahin rahaa jaisaa ki usase pehle ke 22 varshon main tha
 Yes, we did not see Sachin's best performance in this period, but he was not the only one
 yadi aap sampurna tasviir par gaur karo, to team test cricket main sangharsh karti rahi he
 So do we believe that India is still a 'one man army' and completely dependent on Sachin
 main maanata hum ki aisa nahin he

 main maanata hum ki aisa nahin he
 Kumble wrote in his column in 'week' magazine, there were many occasions when he single-handedly won India, but he never remained the sole cause of India's defeat
 behatar yahi hoga ki unke saamne jo he, usase unhen khud nibatane den, kyonki koi unki jagah nahin le saktaa
 No one has played 192 Test matches so far, not scored 34 thousand runs or scored 100 centuries
 unhen vah sammaan den, jiske vah hakdaar hai
 The comments unhone likhaa he, pichley 23 saal main unhone logon ke sapane saakaar karne main madad kii
 Made him feel better emotionally
 ab hamen unki bhaawanaaon kii bhi kadra kerani chahie
 He said that not only Tendulkar, but the entire team is going through a bad phase and it would be completely wrong to say that this team is performing badly due to Tendulkar's poor form
 kumble ne kaha, pehali baar log team main unke sthaan par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 It is being said that he should retire, because his performance in the last year or recently has not been the same as it was in the previous 22 years
 haa hamane is daur main sachin kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan nahin dekha, lekin keval vah akele aise nahin rahe
 If you look at the whole picture, the team has struggled in Test cricket
 to kya ham yah maanate hai ki bharat ab bhi 'van main army' he or puri tarah se sachin par nirbhar he
 i agree that it is not so

 Session: How he wrote his first book Speakers: An interview was going on with Amish Tripathipatrakars
 ek ladki ne kaha ki aap bahut prerak hai
 i was a little nervous to hear it
 maine kaha ki are maine aisa kya kiya he ki main kisi ko prerana de sakuun
 She said that i used to hate my job, my boss
 selary kam lagati thi
 Then she got Siva Triology and she felt that everything was not over
 phir usne tay kiya ki vah bhi naukari chhodeygi or kitaab likhegi
 Mind rocks: Brokers will not let the assembly go: Kejriwal i felt that if writing has such an effect, then if i tell this girl right now, go, resign, do whatever you want, then it will do it
 magar jimmedaari bhi thi
 Then i decided to tell him that i had not taken any impulse to become a writer
 clice he, magar raaton-raat mujhe bhi kamyaabi bhi nahin mili
 Took eight years, the first difficulty for this time was how to write
 aaj se pehle kabhi kuch bhi fiction nahin likhaa tha
 In college, Maha Ghatiya used to write poetry, which was then heard by my girlfriend and now wife
 Mind rocks: aaj tak auraton ko danga karte nahin dekhah kiran bediphir jab tay hua ki main kitaab likhuunga to mere doston ne majaak banaaya
 He used to think that i was creatively challenged, then i was doing a bank job
 magar mere parivaar ne saport kiya
 Keep in mind that i was working till the first two books were written
 to ye behad jaruri tha
 So the first understanding is that it is important for you to have great talent, but with it you need hard work and practice
 mehnat kaa koi vikalp nahin he
 And it is used continuously in practice
 doosraa point he khud par yakeen hone kaa
 Self Belief
 log mujhase puuchhen ki kya aapke andar self billief he
 If asked about books, the answer is yes
 magar kya jindagi ke har morche par mere paas self philosphi he
 So maybe you have to find the answer
 jab meri pehali kitaab kai publisher ke paas ja rahi thi
 So everyone was rejecting
 kah rahe the ki isamen bahut gyaan he
 He was showing little interest
 magar main kisi bhi badlaav ke liye taiyaar nahin tha
 The book, written in it for me, was very personal
 sab kuch personal tha
 So i did not care what people are saying about the book about the Immortals of Meluha
 isse mujhe ye yakeen aa gaya ki fail hone yaa naakaamayaab hone kaa dar nahin thaharnaa chahie
 The need is to get your inner confidence, to understand its signs
 aakhri baat jo main kahana chahta hum vah he ashavad
 There are few people who are born with silver spoon
 unke liye chijen sulabh hai
 But things are not easy for most of us Indians
 ki bas ek roj uthe or sab chhod sapana puraa karnaa shuru kar diya
 So avoid responsibilities, avoid everyday things
 aap apni naukari or baaki chizon ke saath bhi apane sapane kaa peechha karnaa shuru kar sakate hai
 In the first 6 years of my writing, i did three things
 naukari kii
 Wrote the book and spend time with the family
 Be rude with yourself
 ummid rakhie
 The foundation of unusual works can be laid even after being normal
 amish ke saath sawaal javabasawalakaadhyatmikta kaa sawaal, kaise apane aasthaa centre banaaen
 When there are so many rituals? Answer: Amish's answer
 ye sahi sawaal he ki agar karmkand samaj hi nahin aate to unhen kyon kiya jaae
 It is not wrong to ask questions
 gairbhartiya nahin he
 You read Bhagavad-gītā
 krishna arjuna ko kehete hai ki meraa kaam tumhen gyaan dena he
 But you have a brain, use it, discuss knowledge and do what you feel is right
 ham cricket khelte hai
 If practicing in the outfield, the coach screams again and again
 sar mat hilaao
 Keep it fixed sir
 kyon kahata he vah
 Why is it a bit like a ritual? agar vah baithkar samajhane lage ki ball jab hawa main hoti he, to kitna swing karti he, kaise aapaki taraf project hoti he
 Take a lot of time, and at that time this calculation cannot be done
 agar sir phixd rahegaa to najar fiks rahegi auki ball kii trejactory ko thik se follow kar sakegi
 Can prove magar ye niyam har jagah lagu nahin ho saktaa
 If you keep your head fixed in badminton then you will lose
 kyonki vahaan baar baar lagaataar nae nae dhang or raaston se shatal aa rahi he
 So you have to watch your rituals
 agar samaj aaen or aapako takat den to chunanaa hoga
 Second question: The question of religion in the country has become a question of mutual hatred
 or raajnneeti main to iskaa istemaal galat niyat ke saath hi kiya jaataa he
 Amish's answer: i do not answer political questions
 pehali vajah, meri raajnneeti kii samaj bahut acchhee nahin he
 Well, if we talk about religion then it is true that every religion has some fundamentalists
 magar zyaadaatar logon ke liye dharm kaa matlab shanti or aasthaa he
 The need is to pay attention to those who operate their faith
 sawaal- murti puja par aapkaa kya rukh he?amish kaa javabanjab mujhe bulaayaa gaya to kaha gaya ki halkaa phulka fan seshan he
 Good question
 agar aap vedon main jawaab khojein, to milegaa ishwar kaa concept chaar staron par he
 At the top is the nirguna formless God
 uskaa koi gender nahin, pahchaan nahin he
 In the olden days it was called Brahman
 ise cast ke saath kanphyus na karen
 It was also called Ekam
 ise sabase supreme mana jaataa tha
 But not everyone could understand it
 to jo log formles god ko samajhane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Forms came for them
 jaise shiv, vishnu
 
 
 Then came the concept of avatar, where human beings came in human form, like Rama and Krishna
 
 
 phir aae ve insaan, jo ishwar ke samakaksh pahunch gaye
 Buddha, Mahavira
 
 
 srilanka ke khilaaf doosraa test match jeetne ke baad hi team india ko bada jhatka laga he
 This star of India will not play the third and last Test match of the left arm spinner series
 isisi ke code of conduct ke ulanghan kii vajah se jadeja ko agle test se nilambit kiya gaya he
 The Pallekel Test will be played from August 12

 In the case of violation of 11, three demerit points were imposed with 50 fines during the Indore Test against New Zealand in October 2016
 tab jadeja ko do baar anaupchaarik or ek aadhikarik chetavanee bhi di gai thi
 He entered the pitch for the fourth time in a safe zone and suffered a loss
 colombo test ke tisare din, jab srilanka kii team duusari pari main foloon khilne utari, to unki pari ke 58wein over main rabindra jadeja ne apane follow thru main gend ko field karke krij par maujuud srilankai ballebaaj dimuth karunaaratne par anaavashyak thro kar diya, jabaki ballebaaj ne ran lene prayaas bhi nahin kiya tha
 The on-field umpires on the field admitted that Jadeja's throw could prove dangerous for the batsman
 maidani ampire bruce oksenford or rod takar ne apni report match referi richi richardsan ko saunpi, jiske baad jadeja ne apni galati sweekaar kar lee he
 Even after this suspension, Jadeja will have 6 demerit points in his account
 aage agar 24 maheene main yah sankhya 8 yaa usase zyada ho jaati he, to yah chaar suspension point main tabdeel ho jayega
 This means that the player concerned will be banned from playing two Tests or four One Day Internationals or as many T20 Internationals - which come first
 aapako bataa den ki colombo test main jadeja ne shandaar pradarshan kiya
 In such a situation, his exit from the next Test played at Pallekele is a big blow for Team India
 colombo test main jadeja ne shandaar oleround pradarshan kiya
 While he scored 70 runs while batting, he also took 7 wickets in the Test match
 srilanka kii foloon pari main unhone 5 wicket chatkaaye the
 Jadeja was awarded the 'man of the Match' for his performance
 maujuuda draft voter list main kuch jaanane yogya tathy bhi hai jaise ki dilli main kul saat loksabhaa seat hai or nai draft voter list ke anusaar dilli main sabase badi loksabhaa seat uttar pashchim dilli he jisamen 22 lakh 87 hazaar 777 voter hai
 While Chandni Chowk Lok Sabha seat is the smallest Lok Sabha seat with 14 lakh 98 thousand 257 voters
 dilli main kul 70 vidhansabha seat hai jisamen se matiyaala sabase badi vidhansabha seat he jisamen teen lakh 64 hazaar 141 voter hai jabaki keval ek lakh 14 hazaar 972 votaron ke saath dilli kaint sabase choti vidhansabha seat he
 In terms of sex ratio, Tilak Nagar assembly seat in West Delhi is at the top where there are around 942 female voters per 1000 male voters while Okhla Assembly seat is at the bottom where only 644 female voters are per 1000 male voters
 ajukeshan system main kai badlaav ko lekar surkhiyon main rahane vaali dilli sarkaar agle seshan se shiksha course, selebus ko lekar kai or badlaav karne ja rahi he
 After the Happiness Classes, Entrepreneurship Program, the Delhi government is also preparing for legal studies in schools
 bataaya ja he ki is seshan se skulon main 'constitution classes' shuru kii jaaegi or isamen bacchon ko kanoon kii jaankaree di jaaegi
 According to the reports, 'constitution Classes' will be started in July and the program will be for students between class-6 to class-12
 is program ke jariye dilli kii skulon main samvidhan ke bare main bataaya jayega
 It is a 10-month program, in which there will be a class every week and will be taught about constitutional value
 iske saath dilli sarkaar ab exam main acha pradarshan karne vaale chaatro ko 2500 rupee dene par vichaar kar rahi he
 Besides, English spiking program is also being started for government school children, in which students will be given training in speaking English
 vahiin is baar ambekar paathshaala main bhi badhotaree kii jaaegi, jahaan garib bacchon ke liye ramedial teaching kii vyavastha kii jaaegi
 It is worth noting that even before this, the Delhi government has taken several steps to change the education system, which was also appreciated
 isamen british council ke saath emoyu sin karnaa, teachers ko videsh main training dena, 'happines karikulam' shuru karnaa aadi shaamil he
 At the same time, the Delhi government claims that the government has done very commendable work in the field of education
 2017 desh kii raajnneeti ke liye bahut ahm he
 This year, assembly elections are going to be held in 7 states, including Uttar Pradesh, the largest in terms of population
 uttar pradesh ke saath hi punjab, uttarakhand, goa or manipur main chunaav hone hai
 At the end of the year, elections will be held in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav par bijepi bahut daaromadar maan rahi he
 Obviously, the results of this election will be echoed in the Gujarat elections, which is directly related to the credibility of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 uttar pradeshmen bijepi beete 14 saal se satta se baahar he
 At present, the party is contesting elections in the best state after a long time
 upi se sabase zyada loksabhaa saansad bijepi ke paas hai
 At the same time, the sit-in opposition split has also cleared the party's ground to a great extent
 is sabake maddenjar party ne apane prachaar kaa nayaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya he
 Interestingly, after sensing the impact of demonetisation on the people for 50 days, now the bjp's strategy is to move away from demonetisation and emphasize on local issues in the state
 poster-hording main notebandi nahin sthaneey muddon par fokaub puure uttar pradesh main jagah-jagah bijepi ke aise poster dikhaai denge, jinamein sidhe taur par pratidwandvi dalon kii khaamiyon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya he
 In these posters, issues like the plight of farmers, poor law and order situation, unemployment, women safety and migration will be given place
 bijepiin sabhi samasyaon se nijaat dilaakar parivartan kaa vaada kar rahi he
 Only faceless issues will be attacked from the party
 It is clear from the party that no face of the Chief Minister will be brought before the elections
 sirf pradhanmantri modi ke chehre ko aage rakhkar party chunavi ran main utregi
 The new strategy of campaigning the party just before the election will be to attack the opponents on the basis of issues rather than showing the face of the leaders
 'kisaan maha abhiyaan' jodega kisaanon senotbandike baad vipaksh ne kisaanon kaa hawala dekar bijepi par hamale tej kiye hai, jisase nipatane ke liye party ne kisaanon se sidhe samvaad kaa kaarykram banaaya he
 Party leaders will meet farmers in two phases
 pehle charan main bijepi lagbhag 400 gaanvon main 'alaav sabhaayen' karegi
 In the second phase, 'mati Tilak Pledge' campaign will be run at the district level
 in sabhaaon main netaa kisaanon ko notebandi ke sakaaratmak prabhaav bataaenge
 At the same time, we will give details of the schemes made for the farmers of the Central Government
 kisaanon ko bataaya jayega ki kis tarah bispi, samaajawaadee party or congress ne unhen dhokhaa diya or modi sarkaar ne unhen phayda pahunchaaya
 In order to keep pace with the times, it is necessary to have digital slogan of digital payment in almost every rally of the Prime Minister in the state
 iske liye baqayada kendriya mantri shaharon or jilon main jaakar digital system sikhaane ke liye chal rahi training kaa hissaa banenge
 There will be an emphasis on telling people that how important the demonetisation step was to join the world in the future
 piem ke 31 disambar ke sandesh ko ghar-ghar pahunchane par jorpradhanmantri ke 31 disambar ko raashtra ke naam sambodhan main kisaanon, mahilaon, chote vyapaariyon or bujurgon ke liye kii gai ghoshnaaen party ke prachaar kaa ahm hissaa banengi
 Changing strategy in view of Samajwadi riot The furore between Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh has also forced BJP to change its electoral strategy
 aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki samaajawaadee party ke tuutane or mulaayam singh ke kamjor hone kaa phayda mayawati ko mil saktaa he
 In such a situation, polarization of minority votes towards the BSP
 is tarah kii sthiti ko hakeekat main badalane se rokane ke liye bijepi kaaphi maathapai kar rahi he
 The bjp's strategy now has BSP corruption above the socialist riot
 sthaneey muddon par focus rakhane kii ranneeti ke saath bijepi ne kaaryakartaaon ko bhi upi kaa kila har haal main fateh karne kii hidaayat di he
 BJP is considering the victory in Uttar Pradesh as a question of its own
 bijepi kii puri koshish he ki aisi koi chook naa kii jaae, jisase baaji uske haath se nikal jaae
 Union Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma said that in the last twenty years in Uttar Pradesh, the opposition parties are less responsible for defeating the Congress and the Congress has been defeating itself
 ispaat mantri verma ne kaha ki gat varsh pradesh main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne na keval jamkar mehnat kii thi balki pradesh main congress kii phija bhi bana di thi
 But only a few people of the Congress turned their efforts on
 unhone kaha ki jis dhang se vidhansabha chunaav main bottla house cond or aarakshan ke muddon ko uthaaya gaya usase congress kii fajihat hui or vipaksh ko laabh hua
 Asked whether raising the issues of reservation and the Batla scandal was a mistake of some Congress leaders, Verma said, "don't forget it was a conspiracy, because there is no system of reservation on the basis of religion in the Constitution
" ’congress ko kamjor karne vaale ‘kuch congressi netaaon’ ke naam poochne par, unhone kaha, ‘is babat mujhase naam mat puuchhiye aap log acchhee tarah jaanate hai
 Verma claimed that the three districts of Gonda, Barabanki and Rae Bareli were targeted in the assembly elections and the Congress was harmed
 itnaa hi nahin barabanki main unke bete rakesh ko haraane ke liye paanch karod rupee kharch kiye gayi
 In response to a question, he said that despite being a national party, Congress candidates win less and independents win more
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki aise logon ke bare main party ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko puri jaankaree he or vah sari vastusthiti ko samajhate bhi hai
 Beni Prasad Verma has not only been the stalwart leader of the Samajwadi Party, but is also one of the founders
 unhone congress ko kamjor karne waalon kaa naam liye bagaiyr daawa kiya, ‘congress ke kuch netaaon kii haisiyat to dekhiye ki ve log karodon rupee main khel rahe hai
 He said that his goal is not only to strengthen the Congress once again in Uttar Pradesh, but he wants to see Rahul Gandhi as Prime Minister
 bhartiya kar kanoon ko asia prashanth kshetra main doosraa sabase jatil kanoon mana jaataa he or pichley teen saal main isko lekar bharosa kam hua he
 This has been said in a survey by Deloitte
 audit or vittiya paraamarsh company delite ne ek survey main kaha ki karadhaan ke maamle main jatil kshetron main china ke baad bharat duusare sthaan par he or kar kii jaruratein kaaphi jatil hai
 According to Deloitte's Asia Pacific Tax Complexity Survey, Japan, Australia, Indonesia and South Korea are followed by India in the Tax Complexity Index
 isamen kaha gaya he, ‘donon deshon (china or bharat) main aadhe se adhik pratibhaagiyon kaa maananaa he ki in kshetron main pichley teen saal main kar jatilta badi hai
 'complexity' here means difficulties in the analysis of tax law and regulations in the area concerned

 aap sab ko yaad dilaa den ki bijepi saansad shatrughna sinha kaa pakistan ke raashtrapati jioul haq ke parivaar ke saath khaas rishta tha
 Shatrughan Sinha used to say from the BJP platform that Ziaul Haq's daughter is his sister
 2012 kii ek khabar he ki jab bhartiya saasandon kaa pratinidhi mandal pakistan gaya tha tab sinha jioul haq kii beti zan zia se bhi milane gaye the
 i am not giving this example because Sinha is a traitor but how can anyone doubt Sinha's patriotism
 lekin sinha ko bijepi ne 2014 main tikat diya
 Even before that he was given a ticket and made a minister
 tab kisi ne sinha se nahin kaha ki aap gaddaar hai yaa bijepi sinha ke zarie pakistan ke saath gathbandhan karnaa chaahati he
 Sinha has been openly playing these relationships

 raajnneeti hameshaa pakistan se apana bachaav karnaa chaahati he
 Recall some old statements by BJP leaders about Pakistan
 isliye rafel deal ko lekar jo sawaal uth rahaa he jawaab uskaa aana chahie
 The issue of Pakistan is different and there can be talk and politics on it, but what does Pakistan mean about Rafael
 kahin aisa to nahin ki pakistan kaa istemaal janata ko bharamaane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 It is a newspaper telegraph printed from London
 isamen dean nelson ne pakistan ke adhikariyon se baat kii he
 Talked to Acting Foreign Minister Sartaz Aziz
 or sheershak main ye likhaa ki pakistan narendra modi ko agle pradhanmantri ke rup main samarthan karata he
 Nawaz Sharif's statement is that Modi will win and we hope that a strong government will come in which will be suitable for dialogue
 agar congress party is akhbaar ko lekar press conference kare ki pakistan or modi main santh ganth he to aap hi bataaiye kutark bhi sharma jaaenge ki nahin
 Did the Congress then have to say that Pakistan wants Modi to win and would any news anchor have debated this matter
 hamaare sahyogi umashankar singh ne apane fasebuk par imran khan kaa bhaashan post kiya he
 Recently elections were held in Pakistan, while speaking at a rally, Imran Khan praised the honesty of Prime Minister Modi
 to kya imran khan or pradhanmantri modi ke bich koi dosti thi, kya is aadhaar par yah nishkarsh nikaala ja saktaa he
 After becoming the Prime Minister, Imran Khan also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Modi and when the talks in New York were canceled, he also made abusive remarks, which all condemned
 disambar 2017 main imran khan dilli aae the or unhone pradhanmantri modi se shishtachar mulaakaat kii thi
 Can it be said on this basis that there is a friendship between Imran Khan and Prime Minister Modi
 koi ranneeti ban rahi he
 In Bhopal, Prime Minister Modi did not name Pakistan but said the same thing that Sambit Patra said in his press conference
 pehle jin logon ne sawaal kiya unhen pakistan kaa samarthak banaaya gaya
 It was spread on social media that these people are helping Pakistan
 ab kaha ja rahaa he ki congress party pakistan se gathbandhan kar rahi he
 What is its basis? khufia jaankaree nahin he
 Is a political statement
 kya aisa sambhav he ki congress party pakistan se gathbandhan kar rahi he 2019 ke liye or aisa kar rahi he to uske khilaaf kanoonee karrwai karne ke liye koi kanoon nahin he
 You will be surprised that related Patra is proving the print out of the tweet to show the basis of this alliance
 kya is aadhaar par raajnneeti ke tark gadhe jaaenge ki yahaan ke vivaad par pakistan ke tivi channel main kya hedline chal rahi he
 What are the leaders tweeting there
 or is aadhaar par pradhanmantri se lekar bhaajapa ke pravaktaa tak yah kahenge ki baahar ke deshon ke saath gathbandhan ho rahaa he
 The questions and answers of the questions that are being raised about the Rafale Deal should be confined to Rafael but from where is the matter reaching
 pradhanmantri kaa pakistan janaa yaa navjot siddhu kaa vahaan janaa un par bahes ho sakati he, hui bhi he lekin rafel deal par jab baat ho rahi ho tab pakistan kaa kya kaam he
 Has the President of Pakistan made a statement that Anil Ambani's name came from the Indian government
 yaa yah bayaan purv raashtrapati francwa oland kaa he
 Pakistan's leaders are tweeting, but in India too many leaders are tweeting
 kya ve sabhi pakistan kii madad kar rahe hai
 Is the answer to raising questions or doing politics about the Rafael deal that Pakistan is being helped
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah to pakistan kaa zikr kab kar den pataa nahin chalata
 Sometimes they start telling the people of Bihar that if the BJP loses, then fireworks will go in Pakistan
 vahaan bijepi haar gai
 There were no firecrackers in Pakistan
 rafel deal ke sandarbh main amit shah ne 22 sitambar ko ek twit kiya or kaha ki rahul gandhi kehete hai modi hataao
 Pakistan says remove Modi
 pakistan jo he vah modi ke khilaaf rahul gandhi ke aadharahin aaropon kaa samarthan kar rahaa he
 So, is the Congress forming an international grand alliance against Modi
 2017 ke gujarat chunaavon me bhi pakistan kaa zikr aa gaya tha
 We would like you here to remember what happened after that statement
 gujarat ke palanpur main bolte hue pradhanmantri modi ke ek aarope ne sansani failaa di thi
 After that allegation, there was a lot of debate on the news channels
 ham aapako bataaenge ki us bahes kaa kya anjaam hua
 This will tell you so that we can remind you once again how news channels propaganda
 aap chahen to utyub par jaakar is bayaan ke baad hui bahason ko phir se dekh sakate hai
 You will definitely go to youtube and watch the debates of news channels to know what the dock media has done to you in these four years

 If the Congress party holds a press conference about this newspaper that there is a lump in Pakistan and Modi, then you tell me whether the sophist will be shy or not
 kya congress ko tab yah kahana tha ki pakistan chahta he ki modi jeeten or kya tab koi news ankar is baat ko lekar dibet karata
 Our colleague Umashankar Singh has posted Imran Khan's speech on his Facebook
 haal main pakistan main chunaav hue the, jisamen ek raily main bolte hue imran khan ne pradhanmantri modi kii eemaandaaree kii tarif kii thi
 So whether there was any friendship between Imran Khan and Prime Minister Modi, can it be concluded on this basis
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad imran khan ne pradhanmantri modi ko patr bhi likhaa or jab neuyork main hone vaali baatcheet radd hui to abhadra tippanee bhi kii, jisaki sabane ninda kii
 Imran Khan came to Delhi in December 2017 and paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister Modi
 kya is aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki imran khan or pradhanmantri modi kii dosti he
 a strategy is being formed
 bhopal main pradhanmantri modi ne pakistan kaa naam nahin liya lekin vahi baat kahi jo sambit paatra ne apane press conference main kahi thi
 Those who questioned earlier were made supporters of Pakistan
 soshal media par failaayaa gaya ki ye log pakistan kii madad kar rahe hai
 It is now being said that the Congress party is in alliance with Pakistan
 iskaa aadhaar kya he
 There is no intelligence
 raajnneetik bayaan he
 Is it possible that the Congress party is aligned with Pakistan for 2019 and doing so, there is no law to take legal action against it
 aap hairaan ho jaaenge ki is gathbandhan kaa aadhaar bataane ke liye sambit paatra twit kaa print out nikaalkar sabit kar rahe hai
 Will the logic of politics be fabricated on the basis that the headline is going on in the TV channel of Pakistan on the dispute here
 vahaan ke netaa kya twit kar rahe hai
 And on this basis, from the Prime Minister to the spokesperson of the BJP, they will say that alliances are happening with the outside countries
 rafel deal ke bare main jo sawaal uth rahe hai uske sawaal or jawaab donon rafel tak hi simit rahane chahie lekin baat kahaan se kahaan pahunch rahi he
 The Prime Minister's visit to Pakistan or Navjot Sidhu's visit there may be a debate on him, it has happened but what is the work of Pakistan when the Rafale deal is being talked about
 kya pakistan ke raashtrapati ne bayaan diya he ki anil ambani kaa naam bharat sarkaar kii taraf se aayaa tha
 Or is it the statement of former President François Hollande
 pakistan ke netaa twit kar rahe hai lekin bharat main bhi to bahut se netaa twit kar rahe hai
 Are they all helping Pakistan
 kya rafel deal ko lekar sawaal uthaane yaa raajnneeti karne kaa jawaab yahi he ki pakistan kii madad kii ja rahi he
 BJP President Amit Shah does not know when to mention Pakistan
 kabhi ve bihar kii janata se kehane lagate hai ki bijepi haar gai to pakistan main pataakhe chalenge
 The BJP lost there
 pakistan main pataakhe bhi nahin chale the
 In the context of Rafael Deal, Amit Shah made a tweet on September 22 and said that Rahul Gandhi says remove Modi
 pakistan kahata he modi hataao
 Pakistan is supporting Rahul Gandhi's baseless allegations against Modi
 to kya congress modi ke khilaaf koi antarrashtriya mahagathbandhan bana rahaa he
 Pakistan was also mentioned in the 2017 Gujarat elections
 ham yahaan chahenge ki aap yaad karen ki us bayaan ke baad kya hua
 Speaking in Palanpur, Gujarat, an allegation from Prime Minister Modi created a sensation
 us aarope ke baad news channelon par khub bahes hui
 We will tell you what the outcome of that debate was
 yah isliye bataaenge taaki ham aapako ek baar phir yaad dilaa saken ki kis tarah news channel propeganda karte hai
 If you want, you can go to youtube and see the debates after this statement again
 aap utyub main jaakar news channelon kii bahason ko zarur dekhiegaa taaki pataa chale ki in chaar saalon main godi media ne aapke saath kya kiya he
 What kind of fake questions came up that had no head and legs
 saare sawaal nakli isliye the kyonki baad main rajyasabha main arun jetali ne us bayaan se kinaaraa kar liya
 The statement made by Arun Jaitley in the Rajya Sabha on 27 December 2017 is very important
 hindi main yah matlab hua ki pradhanmantri modi ne apane bayaan main purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh yaa purv up raashtrapati hamid ansaari kii bharat ke prati nishtha par koi sawaal nahin uthaaya
 If the Prime Minister's statement makes any assumption about Manmohan Singh's commitment to India, it is not correct
 ham in netaaon kaa or bharat ke prati inaki nishtha kaa bahut aadar karte hai
 Jaitley ji is saying this
 jabaki chunaav main manishankar ayyar ke ghar hui baithak ko lekar kis tarah ke bayaan die gaye or us bayaan ke baad kya hua wo hamane aapako bataa diya
 Surely after Jaitley's statement, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad assured that we do not believe in reducing the dignity of the Prime Minister
 chunaavon ke dauraan pradhanmantri ke prati die gaye aise kisi bhi bayaan se khud ko alag karte hai
 So you remember that Prime Minister Modi had to apologize to the government in the House for the way he linked Manmohan Singh and Hamid Ansari to Pakistan in the Gujarat elections
 aap hindi ke akhbaar padhate hai
 Please read them carefully
 dekhie ki rafel deal ke bare main sirf bayanon kii reporting he yaa unke yahaan kaam karne vaale shandaar reporter apni taraf se padtaal bhi kar rahe hai
 From this point of view, you will do well for talented journalists who really want to do journalism
 ek kaam kijiega, rafel deal par aapke priy hindi akhbaar main jitani bhi khabaren chhapi hai un sabko ek jagah rakhkar phir se padhie
 Remind you all that BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha had a special relationship with the family of Pakistan President Ziaul Haq
 shatrughna sinha bijepi ke manch se kaha karte the ki jioul haq kii beti unki bahan he
 There is a report in 2012 that when the delegation of Indian mps visited Pakistan, Sinha also went to meet Ziaul Haq's daughter Zain Zia
 main yah misaal isliye nahin de rahaa ki sinha deshadrohi hai balki sinha ke deshprem par koi shaq kaise kar saktaa he
 But Sinha was given a ticket in 2014 by the BJP
 uske pehle bhi tikat diya or mantri banaaya
 Then no one told Sinha that you are a traitor or BJP wants to combine with Pakistan through Sinha
 sinha apane in sambandhon ko khulkar nibhaate rahe hai
 Has anyone from within BJP dared to call him an agent of Pakistan? ham kahaan se kahaan aa gaye hai
 The comments companiyon or cricket premiyon ko kuch fark nahin padataa ki hamaari raajnneeti pakistan ke bare main kya sochati he
 People wait when Pakistan will match
 jab bhi hota he ve match dekhte hai
 During the broadcast of India Pakistan match in Dubai, you must have seen how many companies advertisements
 bazaar hameshaa pakistan ke saath hone vaale match kaa laabh uthaata he
 Politics always wants to defend itself from Pakistan
 pakistan ko lekar bhaajapa netaaon ke kuch puraane bayanon ko yaad karte hai
 Therefore, the question arising on Rafael Deal should be answered
 pakistan kaa masalaa alag he or us par baat ho sakati he or us par raajnneeti bhi ho sakati he lekin rafel ko lekar pakistan kaa kya matlab he
 Is it not that Pakistan is being used to mislead the people
 to kya imran khan or pradhanmantri modi ke bich koi dosti thi, kya is aadhaar par yah nishkarsh nikaala ja saktaa he
 After becoming the Prime Minister, Imran Khan also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Modi and when the talks in New York were canceled, he also made abusive remarks, which all condemned
 disambar 2017 main imran khan dilli aae the or unhone pradhanmantri modi se shishtachar mulaakaat kii thi

 main yah misaal isliye nahin de rahaa ki sinha deshadrohi hai balki sinha ke deshprem par koi shaq kaise kar saktaa he
 But Sinha was given a ticket in 2014 by the BJP
 uske pehle bhi tikat diya or mantri banaaya
 Then no one told Sinha that you are a traitor or BJP wants to combine with Pakistan through Sinha
 sinha apane in sambandhon ko khulkar nibhaate rahe hai
 Has anyone from within BJP dared to call him an agent of Pakistan? ham kahaan se kahaan aa gaye hai
 The comments companiyon or cricket premiyon ko kuch fark nahin padataa ki hamaari raajnneeti pakistan ke bare main kya sochati he
 People wait when Pakistan will match
 jab bhi hota he ve match dekhte hai
 During the broadcast of India Pakistan match in Dubai, you must have seen how many companies advertisements
 bazaar hameshaa pakistan ke saath hone vaale match kaa laabh uthaata he
 Politics always wants to defend itself from Pakistan
 pakistan ko lekar bhaajapa netaaon ke kuch puraane bayanon ko yaad karte hai
 Therefore, the question arising on Rafael Deal should be answered
 pakistan kaa masalaa alag he or us par baat ho sakati he or us par raajnneeti bhi ho sakati he lekin rafel ko lekar pakistan kaa kya matlab he
 Is it not that Pakistan is being used to mislead the people
 kya is aadhaar par raajnneeti ke tark gadhe jaaenge ki yahaan ke vivaad par pakistan ke tivi channel main kya hedline chal rahi he
 What are the leaders tweeting there
 or is aadhaar par pradhanmantri se lekar bhaajapa ke pravaktaa tak yah kahenge ki baahar ke deshon ke saath gathbandhan ho rahaa he
 The questions and answers of the questions that are being raised about the Rafale Deal should be confined to Rafael but from where is the matter reaching
 pradhanmantri kaa pakistan janaa yaa navjot siddhu kaa vahaan janaa un par bahes ho sakati he, hui bhi he lekin rafel deal par jab baat ho rahi ho tab pakistan kaa kya kaam he
 Has the President of Pakistan made a statement that Anil Ambani's name came from the Indian government
 yaa yah bayaan purv raashtrapati francwa oland kaa he
 Pakistan's leaders are tweeting, but in India too many leaders are tweeting
 kya ve sabhi pakistan kii madad kar rahe hai
 Is the answer to raising questions or doing politics about the Rafael deal that Pakistan is being helped
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah to pakistan kaa zikr kab kar den pataa nahin chalata
 Sometimes they start telling the people of Bihar that if the BJP loses, then fireworks will go in Pakistan
 vahaan bijepi haar gai
 There were no firecrackers in Pakistan
 rafel deal ke sandarbh main amit shah ne 22 sitambar ko ek twit kiya or kaha ki rahul gandhi kehete hai modi hataao
 Pakistan says remove Modi
 pakistan jo he vah modi ke khilaaf rahul gandhi ke aadharahin aaropon kaa samarthan kar rahaa he
 So, is the Congress forming an international grand alliance against Modi
 2017 ke gujarat chunaavon me bhi pakistan kaa zikr aa gaya tha
 We would like you here to remember what happened after that statement
 gujarat ke palanpur main bolte hue pradhanmantri modi ke ek aarope ne sansani failaa di thi
 After that allegation, there was a lot of debate on the news channels
 ham aapako bataaenge ki us bahes kaa kya anjaam hua
 This will tell you so that we can remind you once again how news channels propaganda
 aap chahen to utyub par jaakar is bayaan ke baad hui bahason ko phir se dekh sakate hai
 You will definitely go to youtube and watch the debates of news channels to know what the dock media has done to you in these four years
 kis tarah ke nakli sawaal uthe jinka koi sir-pair nahin tha
 All the questions were fake because later in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley opted out of that statement
 27 disambar 2017 ko arun jetali ne rajyasabha main jo bolaa tha wo bayaan kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 In Hindi, it meant that Prime Minister Modi did not question the loyalty of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh or former Vice President Hamid Ansari to India in his statement
 agar pradhanmantri ke bayaan se bharat ke prati manmohan singh kii patibaddhta ko lekar koi dharna bani he to vah sahi nahin he
 We have great respect for these leaders and their loyalty to India
 ye jetali ji kah rahe hai
 While in the election, what kind of statements were made about the meeting that took place at Mani Shankar Aiyar's house and we told you what happened after that statement
 zarur jetali ke bayaan ke baad congress netaa gulam nabi azaad ne aashwaasan diya tha ki ham pradhanmantri kii garima kam karne main yakeen nahin karte hai
 Distinguishes himself from any such statement made towards the Prime Minister during elections
 to aapako yaad ho gaya ki pradhanmantri modi ne gujarat chunaavon main manmohan singh or hamid ansaari ko jis tarah se pakistan se joda use lekar sadan main sarkaar ko maafee maangani padi thi
 You read Hindi newspapers
 unhen dhyaan se padhaa kiijie
 See if the statements about the Rafael deal are just reporting or the brilliant reporters working here are also investigating on their behalf
 aap is nazar se dekhenge to vaise pratibhashali patrakaron kaa bhala karenge jo vaaki patrakarita karnaa chaahate hai
 Do one thing, keep all the news published in your favorite Hindi newspaper on Rafale Deal and keep it in one place and read it again
 aap sab ko yaad dilaa den ki bijepi saansad shatrughna sinha kaa pakistan ke raashtrapati jioul haq ke parivaar ke saath khaas rishta tha
 Shatrughan Sinha used to say from the BJP platform that Ziaul Haq's daughter is his sister
 2012 kii ek khabar he ki jab bhartiya saasandon kaa pratinidhi mandal pakistan gaya tha tab sinha jioul haq kii beti zan zia se bhi milane gaye the
 i am not giving this example because Sinha is a traitor but how can anyone doubt Sinha's patriotism
 lekin sinha ko bijepi ne 2014 main tikat diya
 Even before that he was given a ticket and made a minister
 tab kisi ne sinha se nahin kaha ki aap gaddaar hai yaa bijepi sinha ke zarie pakistan ke saath gathbandhan karnaa chaahati he
 Sinha has been openly playing these relationships
 kya kabhi bijepi ke bheetar se kisi ko himmat hui ki unhen pakistan kaa agent kah de
 Where have we come from? tippaniyan Companies and cricket lovers do not care what our politics thinks about Pakistan
 log intazaar karte hai ki kab pakistan se match hoga
 They watch the match whenever it happens
 dubai main bharat pakistan match ke prasaaran ke dauraan aapane kitni companiyon ke vigyaapan dekhe honge
 The market always takes advantage of the match with Pakistan
 raajnneeti hameshaa pakistan se apana bachaav karnaa chaahati he
 Recall some old statements by BJP leaders about Pakistan
 isliye rafel deal ko lekar jo sawaal uth rahaa he jawaab uskaa aana chahie
 The issue of Pakistan is different and there can be talk and politics on it, but what does Pakistan mean about Rafael
 kahin aisa to nahin ki pakistan kaa istemaal janata ko bharamaane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 The Prime Minister's visit to Pakistan or Navjot Sidhu's visit there may be a debate on him, it has happened but what is the work of Pakistan when the Rafale deal is being talked about
 kya pakistan ke raashtrapati ne bayaan diya he ki anil ambani kaa naam bharat sarkaar kii taraf se aayaa tha
 Or is it the statement of former President François Hollande
 pakistan ke netaa twit kar rahe hai lekin bharat main bhi to bahut se netaa twit kar rahe hai
 Are they all helping Pakistan
 kya rafel deal ko lekar sawaal uthaane yaa raajnneeti karne kaa jawaab yahi he ki pakistan kii madad kii ja rahi he
 BJP President Amit Shah does not know when to mention Pakistan
 kabhi ve bihar kii janata se kehane lagate hai ki bijepi haar gai to pakistan main pataakhe chalenge
 The BJP lost there
 pakistan main pataakhe bhi nahin chale the
 In the context of Rafael Deal, Amit Shah made a tweet on September 22 and said that Rahul Gandhi says remove Modi
 pakistan kahata he modi hataao
 Pakistan is supporting Rahul Gandhi's baseless allegations against Modi
 to kya congress modi ke khilaaf koi antarrashtriya mahagathbandhan bana rahaa he
 Pakistan was also mentioned in the 2017 Gujarat elections
 ham yahaan chahenge ki aap yaad karen ki us bayaan ke baad kya hua
 Speaking in Palanpur, Gujarat, an allegation from Prime Minister Modi created a sensation
 us aarope ke baad news channelon par khub bahes hui
 We will tell you what the outcome of that debate was
 yah isliye bataaenge taaki ham aapako ek baar phir yaad dilaa saken ki kis tarah news channel propeganda karte hai
 If you want, you can go to youtube and see the debates after this statement again
 aap utyub main jaakar news channelon kii bahason ko zarur dekhiegaa taaki pataa chale ki in chaar saalon main godi media ne aapke saath kya kiya he
 What kind of fake questions came up that had no head and legs
 saare sawaal nakli isliye the kyonki baad main rajyasabha main arun jetali ne us bayaan se kinaaraa kar liya
 The statement made by Arun Jaitley in the Rajya Sabha on 27 December 2017 is very important
 hindi main yah matlab hua ki pradhanmantri modi ne apane bayaan main purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh yaa purv up raashtrapati hamid ansaari kii bharat ke prati nishtha par koi sawaal nahin uthaaya
 If the Prime Minister's statement makes any assumption about Manmohan Singh's commitment to India, it is not correct
 ham in netaaon kaa or bharat ke prati inaki nishtha kaa bahut aadar karte hai
 Jaitley ji is saying this
 jabaki chunaav main manishankar ayyar ke ghar hui baithak ko lekar kis tarah ke bayaan die gaye or us bayaan ke baad kya hua wo hamane aapako bataa diya
 Surely after Jaitley's statement, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad assured that we do not believe in reducing the dignity of the Prime Minister
 chunaavon ke dauraan pradhanmantri ke prati die gaye aise kisi bhi bayaan se khud ko alag karte hai
 So you remember that Prime Minister Modi had to apologize to the government in the House for the way he linked Manmohan Singh and Hamid Ansari to Pakistan in the Gujarat elections
 aap hindi ke akhbaar padhate hai
 Please read them carefully
 dekhie ki rafel deal ke bare main sirf bayanon kii reporting he yaa unke yahaan kaam karne vaale shandaar reporter apni taraf se padtaal bhi kar rahe hai
 From this point of view, you will do well for talented journalists who really want to do journalism
 ek kaam kijiega, rafel deal par aapke priy hindi akhbaar main jitani bhi khabaren chhapi hai un sabko ek jagah rakhkar phir se padhie
 Remind you all that BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha had a special relationship with the family of Pakistan President Ziaul Haq
 shatrughna sinha bijepi ke manch se kaha karte the ki jioul haq kii beti unki bahan he

 How could he become like this, what background was behind it - it was this original curiosity that inspired us to look into the depths of his life
 iske bahut saare kaaran the, jo is kitaab main vistaar se aae hai

 He used to say that in the justification of the decision the political party takes, it states that it is the result of hundreds of brainstorming thoughts
 nagarjun maanate the ki lekhak to hajaaron, lakhon dimaagon kaa pratinidhi hota he
 His words cannot be completely unintelligible

 If we look at Nagarjuna, he will find that his political ideals were so high and loyalty so deep that he could give up care even to the party-leadership when needed
 yah takat unhen kahaan se milti thi? koun-se adarsh the unke? uttar to or bhi sroton se uplabdh he, lekin ek jeevani-lekhak ke liye jaruri tha ki us maas bhar chale skool kaa detail dhunde
 Now the difficulty is that within this huge, multifaceted freedom struggle, what could be the good of this month school, so nothing was written about it in books, magazines

 It was a very interesting experience to see and experience all these episodes in that era and with them
 ise main kabhi nahin bhul saktaa
 Say that it is my wealth now
 duusare yah bhi tha ki nagarjun aankh mundakar gurubhakti karne vaale aadmi apni tarunai main bhi nahin the
 So there was commentary, criticism and criticism between the two
 aazaadee ke baad jo hamane jameendaari unmoolan hote dekha, isaki samoochee peethika sahjanand kii kaayam kii hui thi or ham sahityavale garv kar sakate hai ki isamen hamaare kaviyon, lekhakon kii bhi kriyaatmak bhoomika bhi rahi
 It is another matter that those who held the power never allowed the land reforms to be implemented, because it would have been for them to ax their own feet

 It is possible that the second part of 'yugar Yatra' will also come

 kerala main ek sarkari farmaan se bavaal paidaa ho gaya he
 Controversy has arisen in Kerala with the official circular issued by the state's local administrative department to local bodies to register marriages of Muslim girls under 18 years of age and boys under 21 years of age
 sthaneey prashasnic vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv dwaara jari is circular main sthaneey nikaayon ko yah nirdesh diya gaya ki ve un muslim ladakiyon or ladakon kii shaadiyon kaa registration karen, jinhone vivaah ke liye jaruri kramash: 18 saal va 21 saal kii umr puri nahin kii he
 The bodies were instructed to do this registration on the basis of the certificate issued by the religious institution
 aadhikarik sutron ne kaha ki aisi shikaayatein aa rahi thim ki sthaneey nikaayon main panjiyakon ke taur par kaary karne vaale sachiv aisi shaadiyon kaa panjikaran karne main anakani kar rahe hai
 Because of this, these people who wish to go to the Gulf countries have trouble

 Official sources said that this circular was issued in view of these complaints
 vam samarthak mahila va saanskrithik sanghathan is circular ke khilaaf saamne aae hai
 He says that this step will push the state into the medieval era
 sipiem samarthak saanskrithik sanghathan ‘purogaamana kala sahitya sangam’ ke adhyaksh professor ve en murali ne kaha, ‘bal vivaah par kanoonee pratibandh he
 The decision taken under the pressure of conservative factions should be nullified
 ’kerala sthaneey prashasnic santhaan ke nideshak pi pi balaan ne bhi aise vivaahon ke kerala vivaah panjikaran ke praavdhaanon ke niyam tahat panjikaran par sarkaar se spashtikaran maanga he
 The government's explanation is that the Muslim Marriage Rules, 1957 do not insist on the age limit and the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2006 does not make it clear that marriage between a boy under 21 and a girl under 18 is illegal
 isliye nunatam umr puri kiye bina muslimon ke vivaahon kaa panjikaran kiya ja saktaa he
 Those strongly opposed to this certificate say that it is against the spirit of the constitution and hereby violates the order of the Supreme Court in which it had set the age limit for marriages
 vakeelon ke anusaar, kanoon ke khilaaf jari kiye gaye kisi prashasnic aadesh ko adaalat main chunauti di ja sakati he

 After the resignation of Gujarat's first woman Chief Minister Anandiben Patel, BJP may announce the name of the new Chief Minister in the next two-three days
 gujarat main darkate janaadhar ko sanbhaalane ke liye bijepi amit shah ko bhi aglaa siem bana sakati he
 According to online media reports, the name of BJP President Amit Shah as the next CM of Gujarat is also being considered seriously
 siyaasi galiyare main is pad ke daavedaar ke liye kuch or naamon par charchaa chal rahi he
 According to sources, in the race to become Chief Minister, Gujarat BJP President Vijay Rupani is being named above all
 darasal, vijay rupani ke liye kaha jaataa he ki sanghathan main unki acchhee pakad he
 a reliable face with experience, Rupani Anandiben's party's organization in the state was weakening after becoming the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 bijepi kii andruni uthapathak haikaman ke paas ja rahi thi
 This was the reason that Vijay Rupani was made president to strengthen the organization
 haalanki vijay rupani khud sarkaar main bhi parivahan mantri kii bhoomika main hai
 In such a situation, he also has experience of running the government for about a year
 shah ke kareebi bhi hai rupanivijay rupani kaa naam isliye bhi sab se upar liya ja rahaa he ki wo amit shah ke karibiyon main se ek hai
 He is also coordinating the government and the organization very well
 yahaan tak ki pichley dinon sarkaar kii jitani bhi mahatvapurn yojanaayen ghoshit kii gayi, wo sabhi anandiben patel kii jagah vijay rupani ne hi kii
 However, experts are also believing that BJP may have to face the loss of Patidar votes in Gujarat if Chief Minister is created from non-patidar community
 modi ke kareebi nitin patel bhi res memanandiben ke uttaradhikari ke taur par doosraa naam nitin patel kaa aa rahaa he
 Nitin Patel comes from a Patidar community, and he has been a minister in the government for a long time
 narendra modi jab gujarat main mukhyamantri the, us vakt nitin patel modi ke kareebi netao main se ek the
 However, at the time of the Patidar movement, Nitin Patel had to suffer the wrath of his own Patidar society
 yahaan tak ki patidaaron ne nitin patel ko samudaay main haasiye par laakar khadaa kar diya tha
 In such a situation, the question is whether Nitin Patel will live up to the bjp's expectations
 sanghathan par pakad bhikhu ko dilaa sakati he kursitisraa naam bhikhu dalsania kaa bhi he
 Bhikhu Dalsania has been working in the organization of the BJP for a long time
 narendra modi jab gujarat main mukhyamantri the tab bhikhu kii sanghathan main kaaphi acchhee pakad thi
 He has also been very close to the RSS
 saaf-suthri chhavi or jativaadee sameekaran bhi bhikhu ke paksh main jate dikh rahe hai
 Full stop in the name of Purushottam Rupala and Saurabh Patel! Purushottam Rupala and Saurabh Patel's name seems to be full stop
 rupala ko haal hi main rajyasabha kaa sadsy banaaya gaya he or unhen kendra main mantri pad bhi diya gaya he
 By the way, he should resign and become the Chief Minister of Gujarat, this thing is not embracing everyone
 duusari ore, ambani parivaar ke damaad hone kii vajah se saurabh patel ke bhi mukhyamantri banane kii koi ummid nahin dikhti
 If Saurabh Patel is made the CM, then in 2017, for the first time, the Aam Aadmi Party, which is planning to contest the assembly elections in Gujarat, will get an issue sitting
 jo vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke liye ghate kaa sauda bhi ban saktaa he
