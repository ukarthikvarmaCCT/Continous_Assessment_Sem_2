 He said that the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense have misled the Parliament, this is a breach of privilege

 Let us tell you that the Bharatiya Janata Party, on the other hand, has also spoken of bringing a motion for breach of privilege against Rahul Gandhi on this issue

 isliye achaanak daam badhane kii baat samaj nahin aati he
 Antony said that according to the deal of the UPA government, 18 out of 126 aircraft were to be built in France and the rest were to be built in India by HAL
 unhone kaha ki jab kisi tarah kii sikret deal hui hi nahin to phir sarkaar daam kyon nahin bataa rahi he
 Congress leader Anand Sharming alleged that the government should clarify the matter inside Parliament
 piem ne cabinet kii suraksha samiti se salaah liye bina rafel deal hi badal di
 The Prime Minister should have told about this deal after returning from France
 anand sharma ne aarope lagaaya ki france ne bilkul hi aise hi aircraft mistra or qatari ko kam daam main beche hai, to phir bharat ke samay par daam adhik kaiso ho gaye
 He said that in November 2016, the Defense Minister had told the prices of the aircraft, so why not now it is being told about it

 Scientists claim that to avoid diabetes, at least 4 cups of tea should be drunk everyday
 adhyayan ke liye europe main tip-2 se peedit 12000 se adhik chaay kii aadat vaale logon ke bare main jaankaree lee gayi or paaya gaya ki har roj chaar cap chaay pine waalon main madhumeh kaa jokhim 20 pratishat kam tha
 The study found that the risk was significantly lower in those who consumed more tea, while those who consumed one to three cups of tea had a higher risk
 visheshgyon ne saath hi aagaah kiya ki doodh or chini mili chaay kaa adhik seven swasthya ke liye kharaab he
 Christian Herder of the University of Heinrich, Germany, said the study, 'obesity is a major cause of type-2 diabetes, but eating also plays an important role, including tea
 ’ After 9 / 11, there was an uproar and he changed the name of his terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba to dodge the world
 nayaa naam rakhaa jamaat-ud-daawa
 After this, 26 / 11 happened in Mumbai, then he played the same game again
 abaki jamaat-ud-daawa kaa naam badal diya or phir ek nayaa naam rakhaa taharik-e-hurmat-e-rasul
 Then this too was banned, so a new political party was formed 'milli Muslim League'
 sapana tha aam chunaav jitkar pakistan kaa pradhanmantri bananaa
 But now the mask has been removed from the face of Lashkar Chief Hafiz Saeed
 pehle america ne di thi paak ko naseehatpahale america ne kaha khuda 'hafiz'
 Now China said Goodbye 'maulana'
 kul milakar pakistan ke liye bhi abahafiz saidako khuda hafiz kehane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 Because Pakistan's biggest sympathizer, China has also told Prime Minister Shahid Khakkan Abbasi in clear words that get this problem out of the country or else you will regret it
 wo yun
 Because under international pressure, allowing this international terrorist to remain in the country without being arrested would put Pakistan in such a difficult situation that even though China would not be able to get him out of this trouble
 ab china ne di pakistan ko salaahlihaaza pakistan ko chini raashtrapati shi jingping ne ek hamdard salaah di he ki hafiz said ko lekar duniya main ban rahi kharaab image ko zahan main rakhte hue use mulk se nikaalkar kisi pashchim asia ke desh main phenkakar apana haath jhaad lenaa chahie
 In a 35-minute meeting between President Xi Jingping and Pakistani Prime Minister Khakkan in China, the Chinese president gave the Pakistani prime minister only open-minded knowledge on Hafiz Saeed for about 10 minutes, given the pressure from India and international agencies
 said ko surkhiyon se dur karne ke liye jingping ne paak ko jald koi rasta nikaalane yaa phir nateeja bhugatne kii salaah di
 Now China said that according to a source close to Goodbye 'maulana' Abbasi, President Xi Jingping said that Chinese President Xi Jingping said that there are some ways to keep Hafiz Saeed out of the discussion
 jab tak koi rasta naa nikle
 Send Saeed to live peacefully in a West Asian country
 kyonki mumbai hamale ke baad se hi wo bharat or vaishvik agenciyon ke nishane par he
 According to the news, after talks with the Chinese President, Abbasi consulted the government's legal team in the case
 haalanki abhi tak hafiz kii kismat kaa faisla nahin hua he
 Trouble for political parties After the international pressure, now Hafiz Saeed's condition has become like that of a washerman's donkey who is neither home nor left
 kyonki america ke pratibandh ke baad ab china kii salaah ne hafiz ko pakistan main bhi rahane laayak nahin choda he
 And the fact that the Pakistani government and other political parties themselves do not want Hafiz to stay in Pakistan
 kyonki aagaamee aam chunaav ke liye usne apni political party bana lee he
 And he is adamant on contesting the election but has not received permission from the courts and Election Commission
 lekin agar parmishan mil jaati he to pakistan main hafiz kii populerity in raajnneetik partiyon ke liye musiibat khadi kar sakati hai
 Hafiz said - Pakistan is running at the behest of Pakistan at a time when the mastermind of Mumbai attacks was dreaming of becoming the wazir-e-azam of the country
 china kii is chatur chaal ne uske chaaron khaane chit kar diya he
 However, jamaat-ud-dawa is accusing the government of coming under pressure from the US and India to take action against Hafiz Saeed
 vahiin ek roza iftaar main patrakaron se baat karte hue hafiz said ne is baat ko maanane se inkaar kar diya ki china us par pratibandh lagaakar pakistan se baahar bhejnaa chahta he
 However, he confessed that China is acting as a super power and Pakistan follows his instructions
 mmal ko aatanki sanghathan ghoshit kiyaek taraf to america pehle hi hafiz said kii raajnneetik party milli muslim lig yani mmal ko videshiatankwaadi sanghathanghoshit kar chuki he
 On the other hand, China has also advised Pakistan to get rid of Hafiz
 aapako bataa den ki isi saal april ke maheene main america ke hafiz said kii siyaasi party ko aatanki sanghathanon kii list main shaamil kiya tha
 In this list of America, the name of the terrorist organization lashkar-e-taybba and tehreek-e-azadi-e Kashmir ie Tajak of the Muslim Muslim League in Pakistan are also included in this list
 itnaa hi nahin america ne hafiz said ke raajnneetik sanghathan milli muslim lig ke 7 sadasyon ko bhi lashkar-e-tayba kii taraf se aatanki gatividhiyon main shaamil hone ke liye videshi aatankwaadi ghoshit kiya tha
 The ten-million-dollar bounty on Hafiz began after the 9–11 attacks on the United States
 jab hafiz ke shuruuaati sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyyaba par pabandi lagaai gai
 
 iske baad usne lashkar ko jamaat-ud-daawa ke naam se dobaaraa shuru kar diya
 But after the Mumbai attack, in order to avoid the sight of security agencies around the world, he turned the jamaat-ud-dawa, the religious face of Lashkar, into tehreek-e-hurmat-e-rasool
 iske baad pakistani raajnneeti main daakhil hone ke liye hi usne milli muslim lig ke naam se ek nappa sanghathan khadaa kiya tha
 But it is also included in America's black list
 itnaa hi nahin uske sir par america ne das million dollar yani kareeb 60 karod kaa inaam bhi rakhaa hua he

 Therefore his role becomes even more important

 Chandrakala is very famous on social media
 par lokapriyata ke maamle main chandrakala uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav se kahin aage hai
 Chandrakala has more than 8,636,348 followers on Facebook
 vahiin, akhilesh ke folbers kii sankhya 6,816,363 he
 Chandrashkala has already been planted in the 'IAS B' in 2017
 chandrakala apni sampatti kaa byoraa dene main difolter sabit hui thim
 Indeed, civil service officers were to present their property records for 2014 until 15 January 2015
 lekin ek saal bitne ke baad bhi in adhikariyon ne apni sampatti kaa byoraa nahin diya tha
 Chandkala's name was also included in it
 centre sarkaar ke saamaanya prashasan evam prashikshan vibhaag kii jaankaree ke mutabik chandrakala kii sampatti 2011-12 main sirf 10 lakh rupee thi
 In 2013-14, it increased to about Rs 1 crore
 yani ek saal main unki sampatti 90 fisadi badi
 In 2011-12, Chandrakala bought a 10 lakh flat in Uppal in Andhra Pradesh by selling her jewelery and salary
 ab unke paas lakhanu ke sarojini naidu maarg par apni beti kirti chandrakala ke naam se 55 lakh kaa flats he

 Look these days, the Election Commission is campaigning on the campaign to make voters aware
 lekin kya wo khud saafe-suthere chunaavon ko lekar sakht he? kya wo khud chunaav kii aachaar samhita kaa sammaan kar rahaa he? jab pichley dinon supreme court kii fatkaar padi to ayog ne fatafat kai netaaon ke prachaar par pabandi lagaai
 From Yogi Adityanath and Mayawati to Sidhu and Azam Khan were banned
 lekin pradhanmantri modi ke khilaaf shikayaton par ayog dhilaa kyon he
 On 9 April, in Latur, the Prime Minister made a statement that the names of the martyrs of Pulwama, who are first time voters, cannot dedicate their vote
 is bayaan ke khilaaf aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kii shikaayat kii gai he, 24 april tak koi faisla nahin hua he
 NDTV has come to know that the file of the complaint made against this speech has disappeared
 chunaav ayog kii website par is shikaayat kaa koi zikr nahin he
 The screenshot of this website shows that the complaint was written 'resolved - that is, disposed off'
 chunaav ayog ise takneekee gadabadi bataa rahaa he
 But after two weeks, the commission is silent on this
 jabaki chunaav ayog ke sutara kehete rahe hai ki karrwai hogi, lekin karrwai hoti najar nahin aati
 Conversely, cases of violation of the code of conduct are increasing
 duusare charan ke matdaan ke baad ayog ne kaha tha ki pradhanmantri ke bhaashan kaa ek hi hissaa aayaa tha
 The entire speech has arrived
 uski pramanit copy kii jaanch ho rahi he
 Now the third phase of voting has ended but the action is not known
 yahi nahin jahaan mayawati ke khilaaf shikaayat par 4 din ke bheetar karrwai ho gai, menka gandhi, yogi adityanath, navjot siddhu ke khilaaf shikaayat par 6 dinon ke bheetar karrwai ho gai vahiin pradhanmantri ke bayaan ke 15 din ho gaye hai
 Action is not detected
 chunaav ayog ne bahut saafe shabdon main kaha tha ki sena kii kisi karrwai kaa zikr chunaav prachaar ke dauraan nahin kiya janaa chahie, lekin pradhanmantri ne pulavama kii air strike ke naam par vot maange
 Many former army officers wrote letters to the President on this use of military action - saying that it is not right to drag the army into politics
 lekin kise fark padaa? lekin pradhanmantri kii ore se ye iklauta ulanghan nahin he
 On 23 April, when he went to Gandhinagar to vote for the third round, he presented it exactly like a show
 pehle maa ke paanv chhue, phir khuli jeep main poling booth tak pahunche or vot dene ke baad raily bhi kii or bhaashan bhi diya
 Whereas even a slight knowledgeer of the electoral code of conduct knows that 48 hours before voting, any form of propaganda is considered wrong in every way

 But with the results of the Lok Sabha, this claim went wrong
 darasal, nattejey aane ke baad ye pataa chalaa ki congress ne mahaj 8 siton par hi gathbandhan kaa khel bigaada he
 That is why even with the SP and BSP, the Congress could not spoil the BJP

 The SP-BSP in these seats did not harm the Samajwadi Party anywhere except the Bhatbadiyun, Banda and Barabanki, while in Basti Dhaurahara, Sant Kabir Nagar, Meerut and Sultanpur, the Congress helped defeat the BSP

 At the same time, Union Social Justice Minister Ramdas Athawale said, 'my demand is that there should be reservation in judicial also
 essi, asti or obisi ko nyaayik sevaaon main 49
 5 percent reservation should be provided
 main privet sector main aarakshan kii maang kaa bhi samarthan karata hum
 'let me tell you, the Narendra Modi government has decided to give 10 percent reservation to the economically backward people of the general class
 aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan bill ko mangalvaar ko loksabhaa main pesh kiya gaya, jahaan use bahumat ke saath paarit kar diya gaya
 After this the bill was introduced in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday
 rajyasabha main congress ne sadan kii kaarywahi ek din ke liye badaye jane ke faisle kaa virodh kiya
 Congress leader Anand Sharma said in the Rajya Sabha, "the manner in which the proceedings of the House were extended without the consent of the opposition parties is not correct
" 
 
 ab sthiti aisi he ki sarkaar or vipaksh ke bich samvaad hota hi nahin he
 
 
 If the House is not able to run, the government has the highest responsibility for it
 
 
 "kendriya mantri thavarchand gahalot ne kaha ki samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak 2019 ko baari bahumat se paas kiya he
 It is expected that the Rajya Sabha will also pass by an overwhelming majority
 sabhi dalon or saansad aisa saamaanya varg jo garib jivan bitaata he use bhi aarthik or shaikshanik laabh mili, aisi maang karti rahi he
 This bill was not brought in haste
 is vishay main mandal kamishan ne bhi apana prativedan diya tha or kaha tha aise varg ko 10 fisadi aarakshan mili
 After that, the Sinho Commission also gave such a report
 sansad main somvaar ko ekbayaan par ghamasanraha
 a statement which the mps are calling their insult and today a resolution of condemnation against Team Anna can also be presented
 yani saansad or team anna ab aamane-saamne hai
 After Team Anna's statement, all the parties unitedly broke down on Team Anna and it was said that this is an insult to democracy
 baat itani bad gai ki sharad yadav ne team anna ke khilaaf sarvadaleey prastaav kii baat kahi he
 Sharad Yadav wants the House to bring these proposals
 lekin, anna hajaare kaa kahana he ki unhen aisi kisi pahal se koi fark nahin padataa
 When there was an uproar in the Parliament, all the parties made a noise
 bijepi kii pidaa ye he ki endie to team anna kii madad kar rahaa tha
 Then why was he targeted? lekin, jo saansad tinke vaale bayaan ko sansad ke apmaan se jodakar dekh rahe hai
 They are probably forgetting how many times the leaders among them have made serious allegations against each other in public forums
 sabase khaas baat to ye he ki sadan ke andar kisi bill kii copy faadane par saansadon ko koi aapatti nahin hoti
 The tenure of the House is extended to discuss the Lokpal Bill, and inside the Rajya Sabha, RJD mps tear up the copy of the Politics Prasad Bill
 sadan kii samiti ne raajnneeti prasad par iske liye koi karrwai nahin kii or na hi mananeey saansadon ne ise sansad kii pratishtha kaa sawaal banaaya
 mps are creating ruckus, but take testimony from the data found from a research, there are criminal cases against 162 mps in the current Lok Sabha, that is, about 29
 83 fisadi saansad daagi hai
 On the other hand, information was received from 224 mps out of 242 in the Rajya Sabha, then criminal cases were found against 19 per cent of the mps
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki tinke vaale bayaan kaa sahaara lekar jis apmaan kii baat kahi ja rahi he, usapar ghamaasan kitna sahi he? Statues of Veer Savarkar, Subhash Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh were installed overnight at the North Campus of Delhi University

 Amid the Doklam standoff, China has now shown its color in Ladakh

 This time, Chinese soldiers have stoned Indian soldiers in Ladakh
 ye ghatana behad hairaan karne vaali he, saath hi kaaphi gambhir bhi he
 Indian agencies are also taking this task of the Chinese Army very seriously

 2
 angesiyon kaa maananaa he ki pengong jhil ke kareeb javaanon kaa aamane-saamne aana koi nai baat nahin he

 magar, is tareeke se hamalaa karnaa kisi purv nirdhaarit ranneeti kaa hissaa najar aata he
 3
 sutron ke mutabik, agenciyon kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki is ghatana ke peeche doklam main chal rahaa gatirodh bhi ho saktaa he
 It is believed that this incident may be part of China's conspiracy to increase tension on other fronts apart from actual control accounts
 4
 The stonewalling incident by the army is seen as a shock to the protocol of peace proposal on the border
 ye bhi samajha ja rahaa he ki ye ghatana seemaa par javaanon ke bich kii sthiti ko or bigaad sakati he
 5
 is baat ko lekar bhi sawaal he ki kya is ghatana ko border gashti dal meeting main charchaa kaa hissaa banaaya ja saktaa he
 Because this time there has been a face-to-face confrontation between the soldiers of the two countries, but the soldiers have also suffered injuries on both sides
 ladakh kii ghatana ko lekar in tamaam pahaluon par vimarsh kiya ja rahaa he
 Now, it has to be seen that what this direction of his army in Ladakh amidst China's obstinate stand on Doklam gives direction to the situation of tension between the two countries

 aaj ramdhaari singh dinakar kii jayanti he
 Agnayya had said about him, "his national consciousness and broad cultural vision, his oozing of speech and his emphasis on elements of poetry, his insistence on Sattvic values keep him in a traditional way
" '' vaaki dinakar samooche jivan raashtra or rashtrawaad se jude rahe
 Be it Indian mythology, nationalism, mythology or peasantry, India was paramount for Dinkar in his interpretation
 unka shuruaati jivan kaaphi sangharsh main beetaa
 He was born on September 23, 1908 in a village called Simaria Ghat in Munger district of Bihar
 shiksha mokama ghat ke skool tathaa phir patna college main hui jahaan itihaas vishay ko lekar bie anars kii pariksha uteern kii
 He later held various positions such as Principal of a school, sub-registrar, Deputy Director in Public Relations Department, Vice Chancellor of Bhagalpur University, Hindi Advisor to Government of India etc
 prachur lekhan kiya
 His penchant for learning languages was highly commendable
 kehete hai unhen sanskrit, angreji, urdu, bangla aadi bhashaaon kaa umdaa gyaan tha
 He was also very popular among the non-hindi speaking people, because his Hindi love was inspiring, not anti-reverence and love of others for his mother tongue
 acharya hajariprasad dvivedi kehete hai ki dinakar ji ne shramsadhy jivan jiya
 His literature practice was unique
 kuch samay pehle mujhe ek sajjan ne kalakatta se patr likhaa ki dinakar ko gyanpith puraskaar milanaa kitna upyukt he? maine unhen uttar main likhaa tha ki- yadi chaar gyanpith puraskaar unhen milte, to unka uchit sammaan hota gadhy, padya, bhaashanon or hindi prachaar ke liye
 Ramdhari Singh Dinkar died on 25 April 1974, but before that he had created a lot of literature in various genres
 apni pustakon or sahitya-sevaaon ke liye unhen kai vishvavidhyalayon se dilit kii maanad oopaadhi mili thi
 Apart from this, he was also honored with Sahitya Academy Award and Jnanpith Award
 bharat sarkaar ne unhen padmabhushan kii oopaadhi se sammanit kiya tha
 Dinkar wrote abundantly and increased from one to one
 chaahe rashmirathi ho, kurukshetra, hunkaar yaa parashuram kii pratiksha, yaa samskruti ke chaar adhyay
 Everyone greatly enriched Hindi literature
 par aaj unki jayanti par sahitya aaj tak par ham baat karenge, urvashi kii
 This wonderful narrative of love, spirituality, God and man
 vishay keval sahitya nahin balki samoochaa jivan darshan
 Dinkar would have become immortal in Hindi literature even if he had written only this composition
 vajah iskaa shilp or prishthbhumi
 His words written in the role of Urvashi, are also present in this era of human development
 saal 1961 main prakashit is kavy naatak se dinakar ne urvashi or pururava ke vaidic, puranic pracheen aakhyaan ko ek naye arth se jodna chaha tha
 Pururava and Urvashi brought different types of thirst to their work
 pururava dharti putr he or urvashi devloak kii apsara, jo nari sulabh jigyaasa ke saath dharti par ai he
 There is the desire of the Godhead within Pururava, then Urvashi wants to enjoy the happiness of the earth with a simple, relaxed attitude
 urvashi prem or saundarya kaa kavy he
 In this role, Dinkar himself writes - The story of Pururava and Urvashi is found in many forms and it has also been interpreted in many ways
 raja pururava som-vansh ke aadi purush hue hai
 Their capital was at Pratishthanpur, near Prayag
 puraanon main kaha gaya he ki jab manu or shraddha ko santaan kii ichha hui, unhone vasishtha rishi se yajna karavaaya
 Shraddha wanted to be the mother of a girl, Manu wanted him to have a son
 kintu, is yajna se kanya hi utpann hui
 Back, moved by Manu's disappointment, Vasistha made him a son
 manu ke is putr kaa naam sudyumna padaa
 When young, Sudyumna, once hunting, went out into a ravaged forest and cursed, he became a young woman, a young woman, and her name was Ela
 isi ila kaa prem chandramaa ke navayuvak putr budh se hua, jiske falswaroop, pururava kii utpatti hui
 For this reason, Pururava is also called Ail and the name of the dynasty running from them is Chandravansh
 urvashi kii utpatti ke vishay main do anumaan hai
 One is that when Apsaras were born from the sea at the time of amrit-manthan, Urvashi was born with them
 doosraa yah ki narayan rishi kii tapasya main vighn daalane ke nimitt jab indra ne unke paas anek apsaraayein bhejin, tab rishi ne apane uru ko thonk kar usamen se ek aisi nari utpann kar di, jo un sabhi apsaraon se adhik rupamati thi
 This woman became Urvashi and Urvashi got her name because she was born from Uru
 bhageerath kii jaangh par baithne ke kaaran ganga kaa bhi ek naam urvashi he
 According to Goddess Bhagwat, the goddess-seat in Badri Dham is called Urvashi-tirtha
 nar-narayan kii tapasya-bhoomi badari dham main hi thi
 It is possible that urvashi-tirtha should be his memorial
 is katha kaa pracheenatam ullekh rugveda main miltaa he
 However, this sukta is so well known that Urvashi had left Pururava and Virhonmutt Pururava was in her custody
 ek din urvashi jab unhen mili, usne yah to bataaya ki vah garbhvatee he, kintu, lautakar phir unke saath rahanaa usne asweekaar kar diya
 Later, in the Shatapatha Brahmin and, on the basis of this, the story of the legend in the Puranas, it is said that Puruvara had six sons from Urvashi's womb, the eldest of whom was Ayu
 kehete hai, nirukt anusaar, aayu kaa arth bhi manushya hota he
 From this point of view, both Manu and Ida and Pururava and Urvashi narrate the same theme
 sristi-vikaas kii jis prakriya ke karttavya-paksh kaa pratik manu or ida kaa aakhyaan he, usee prakriya kaa bhaavana-paksh pururava or urvashi kii katha main kaha gaya he
 Sir William Wilson had speculated that pururva-urvashi's narrative is allegorical
 is katha kaa vaastavik nayak surya or nayika usha he
 The two meet for a brief period; Later, they get lost every day
 kintu, is katha ko lene main vaidic aakhyaan kii punrariti athwa vaidic prasang kaa prayaavartan meraa dhyey nahin rahaa
 In my view, Pururava is the symbol of Sanatana male and Urvashi is the symbol of Sanatana female
 urvashi shabd kaa koshgat arth hoga utkar abhilaashaa, aparimit vaasana, ichha athwa kaamana
 And the meaning of the word Pururava is - the person who performs many types of rava, is beset by various sounds
 urvashi chakshu, rasna, ghran, tvak tathaa shroatra kii kaamanaayon kaa pratik he; pururava rup, ras, gandh, sparsh or shabd se milanevaale sukhon se uddelit manushya
 Pururava is in duality, because it is human nature to live in duality
 manushya sukh kii kaamana bhi karata he or usase aage nikalne kaa prayaas bhi
 The woman is not satisfied by touching the male, nor does the male take satisfaction in embracing the woman
 koi shakti he jo nari ko nar tathaa nar ko nari se alag rahane nahin detii, or jab ve mil jate hai, tab bhi, unke bheetar kisi aisi trisha kaa sanchaar karti he, jisaki tripti sharir ke dharaatal par anuplabdh he
 There is another woman within the woman, who is inconspicuous and sensuous
 is nari kaa sandhaan purush tab paata he, jab sharir kii dhara, uchhaalate-uchhaalate, use man ke samudr main phenk detii he, jab daihik chetana se pare, vah prem kii durgam samadhi main pahunch kar nispand ho jaataa he
 And within the man also there is another man, who does not live on the surface of the body, so in the absence of meeting, the woman wants to reach beyond the organ
 parirambh-pash main bandhe hue premi, paraspar ek duusare kaa atikaraman karke, us aise lok main pahunchnaa chaahate hai, jo kirnojjwal or viviya he
 The touch of the imperceptible plane from the path of the senses is the spiritual glory of love
 desh or kaal kii seemaa se baahar nikalne kaa ek maarg yoga he, kintu uski duusari raah nar-nari-prem ke bheetar se bhi nikalati he, manushya kaa yah anumaan atyant pracheen he
 There must have been some such belief in the core of tantra-sadhana; Some such emotion must have worked in the minds of the sahajmargis; Even within innovative psychology, some such inspiration is active
 kaam-sukh kii inhen niraakaar jhankrutiyon kaa aakhyaan manovigyaan udaattikaran kii bhashaa main karata he
 a sublime state of love is also one that resembles samadhi
 jiske vyaktitv kaa devopam vikaas hua he, jiske snaivik taar chetan or sajiv hai tathaa jiskaa man, swabhaav se hi, urdhvagami or uddyansheel he, use kaam ke sparsh maatr se is samadhi kaa bodh hota he
 Tattarinस्पaर्शaसaसaौaौa परa pārmanubhavati sa सच्चchidānāndarupamत्रात्राatrasīt vārānabhīna rāmaranatīrpe: Yoganidāra Gateva
 manushya ke is dwandv kaa, saakaar se upar uthakar niraakaar tak jane kii is akulata athwa andriyata se nikalakar atindriya jagat main aankh kholane kii is umang kaa pratik pururava he
 However, Urvashi is completely free from conflicts
 deviyon main dwandv nahin hota, ve trikaal anudign, nirmal or nishpaap hoti hai
 They feel little, if they become mother or full human, when the juice of the soil converges them completely
 bhaavana or tark, hriday or mastishk, kala or vigyaan athwa niruddeshy anand or soddeshy sadhana, maanviya gunon ke ye jode naveen manushya ko bhi dikhaai dete hai or ve pracheen maanav ko bhi dikhaai pade the
 The narrative of Manu and Ida is the narrative of reason, mind, science and spiritual practice of life; He gives importance to the meaning of effort
 kintu pururava-urvashi kaa aakhyaan bhaavana, hriday kala or niruddeshy anand kii mahima kaa aakhyaan he; vah purusharth ke kaam-paksh kaa mahatmaya bataata he
 Just as the three parts of effort have been said, similarly, the surface of a man's inner personality is also three
 manushya ke saare vyaktitv samgr jivan kaa aadhaar uski jaev bhaawanaaon kaa dharaatal he
 This is the ground on which there is no distinction between humans and animals, and this is the most powerful and the most ancient
 manushya ko pashuon se bhinn karne vaale, buddhi or aatma ke do dharaatal, baad main utpann hue
 Although the soul is also in animals, but the power of the member's conscience, which is the main quality of humanity, is not in animals
 kintu manushya ne jis pariman main buddhi arjeet kii, usee pariman main usne sahaj pravriti jise angreji main instict kehete hai kii shakti ko kho diya
 Even then, intelligence is there even among some animals and the instinctive tendency sometimes, even in humans, is reflected
 bhed yah he ki pashu kaa sara jivan sahaj pravriti se chalata he, keval uske kinare-kinare buddhi kii halaki jhaalar vidyaman he
 And the basis of all human life is intelligence, instinctual tendency, sometimes, it flashes like lightning
 tab bhi, manushya kaa sarvottam kavy sarvocch darshan or vigyaan ke aashaatheet avishkaar, ye sab-ke-sab sambuddhi, jise intuishan kah sakate hai, se sanketit hote hai, jo bahut kuch sahaj pravriti ke hi samaan he
 Artha and Kama, these are the malefics of the bio-plane, but religion is born on the surface of the soul
 buddhi in donon dharaatalon kii sevika or sahaayak he
 But, the ease with which she serves the Earth, she cannot serve religion and work with the same ease
 arth ke upkaran, bhojan, chajan, motor, mahal, sena, samaaj or manushya ke saare bhautik abhiyaan hai, jo buddhi ke vrutt main padate hai
 However, the parts of work are art, taste, aesthetics and love, which are mainly indicative of enlightenment
 isi prakaar buddhi, dharm ko bhi siddh nahin karti
 Religion draws inspiration from equal enlightenment
 dharm kaa janm aatma ke dharaatal par hota he, kintu, sarthakata uski tab he, jab vah jaev dharaatal par aakar hamaare aacharnon ko prabhavit kare
 Art, beauty, beauty and love are born on the organic plane, but their meaning is proved when they rise above and touch the surface of the soul
 sahitya ke nau mul bhaavon main se rati, krodh, bhay or ghrinaa, ye mul bhav bhens main bhi hote hai, kintu pashuon main jo bhav angadh or kurup hai, manushya main aakar ve anek rang-roopon main badal kar nissim ho gayi hai, kyonki manushya main buddhi or kalpana kii shakti he, jo pashuon main nahin he
 In animals, the inspiration which is equal to ritu-dharma, in humans it does not accept the bond of ritu-dharma, nor does it end at the limit of prajrishti
 kaam-shakti pashu-jagat main aavashyaktaa or upyog kii seemaa main he
 She has become a cause of such joy in human beings that is purposeless, innocent and purposeless
 vah nity naye-naye pulkon kii rachana karti he, nayi-nayi kalpanaaon ko janm detii he or manushya ko nity naveen sphuranon se anupranit rakhti he
 It is true that the freedom that animals enjoy in the field of work is not for humans
 kintu, kaamajnya sphuranon, preranaon or sukhon kaa jo anant-vyapee prasar manushya main he, vah kalpanaaheen jantuon main nahin ho saktaa
 And even in human beings, those who are far away from animalism, they know more the taste of subtle pleasures of work
 kaamajnya preranaon kii vyaptiyaan sabhyataa or samskruti ke bheetar bahut dur tak pahunchi hai
 If a young man looks at a young woman with admiration, from the very next day, the gesture of that girl starts changing, she feels the need for innovation in dress and toiletries, a new way of speaking, walking and seeing her a break occurs
 or, isi prakaar, jab koi nari prashansa-bhari drushti se kisi purush ko dekh leti he, tab angadh purush ke bheetar bhi koi kalpak jaag uthta he, koi kavita sugabugane lagati he, soundarya kii koi trisha jag kar use aaine ke paas le jaati he
 These formless gimmicks of work are the subtle steps of sublime
 twachaaen, sparsh ke dwaara, sundarata kaa jo parichay praapt karti hai, vah adhuraa or apurna hota he
 He reaches perfection when we are in the Nididhyasana or Samadhi of beauty
 kala, sahitya or, visheshat:, kavy main bhautik soundarya se pare bhautikottar soundarya kaa sanket detii he, physical ko laangh kar ‘meta-figical’ ho jaati he
 Even in love, there is the power to rise above the ghost and be post-mortar, drowning within the form and the inspiration to make it aloof
 apane sthool se sthool rup main bhi, prem ek maanav kaa duusare maanav ke saath ekaakaar hone kaa sabase sahaj, sabase swaabhaavik maarg he; kintu, viksit or udaatt ho jane par to vah manushya ko bahut kuch vahi sheetaltaa pradaan karata he, jo dharm kaa avdaan he
 Dharmadartho means Kama: kamadharma-phalodaya:
 - padmapurana
 Meaning and meaning are achieved by religion, but by work we get the fruits of religion
 jivan main sookshm anand or niruddeshy sukh ke jitne bhi sote he, ve, kahi-na-kahin, kaam ke parvat se footte hai
 Whose work is frustrated, neglected or blocked, he is deprived of many subtle forms of joy
 hin keval vahi nahin he, jisane dharm or kaam ko chhodkar keval arth ko pakadaa he; nyaayat: uktha kaath to us sadhak ko bhi kahana chaiye, jo dharm-siddhi ke prayaas main arth or kaam donon se yuddh kar rahaa he
 Charitable work Wanders in the soul's space
 pururava ke bheetar devatv kii trisha he
 Therefore, he is distraught and ingrained in the many pleasures of mortal folk
 urvashi devloak se utari hui nari he
 She wants to enjoy the happiness of the earth with a simple, relaxed sense
 pururava kii vednaa samgr maanav-jati kii chirantan vednaa se dhvanit he
 But from where does this anguish of humanity originate? Where does this insurmountable struggle of the human mind come from? The plane of the soul draws man up and the attraction of the bio-plane is downwards
 jab pashuon se alag hone laga, yah vednaa tabhi se uske saath ho gayi
 Humanity is the best name for human suffering
 manushya ne devataaon kii jo kalpana kar rakhi he, uske gaj se apane-aapako naapane main vah asamarth he
 If a man tries to touch his neck with the constellation, then his feet are uprooted from the ground, and he becomes a helpless flying leaf in the air
 or yadi vah paanv jamaa kar dharti par khadaa rahe, to apane mastak se vah nakshatra to kya, saamaanya vrikshon ke mouli ko bhi nahin chhu saktaa
 The god of man's imagination is one who does not get wet with water even when he comes into the water, whose neck is seen even higher than the sea by the highest waves
 kintu, manushya kaa bhagya aisa nahin he
 He gets wet with them even while fighting the waves and often the waves throw him out into the gorge, making a vortex trap and bury him in the bottom
 tab bhi, sangharsh karnaa manushya kaa swabhaav he
 He rises to the sky like water on the rays of the sun and returns to the earth with clouds
 or surya kii kirane, ek baar phir, use akaash par le jaati hai
 Whether or not man will ever get rid of this constant movement between heaven and earth, the reliable knowledge of it has left the new man
 isliye main is vishay main maun hum ki pururava jab sanyas lekar chale gayi, tab unka kya hua
 On the one hand there are high imaginations of divinity; On the other hand, the unmoving cries of blood swaying and the impenetrable rocks of concrete reality encircling them, who do not obey, who do not know how to melt
 aadmi hawa or pathar ke do chhoron ke bich jatke khaataa he, or jhatka khaakar, kabhi is ore, or kabhi us ore ko mud jaataa he
 Ever love! Never renounce! And renunciation cannot tolerate love, not love renunciation, because love is nature and God is sanyas and man has been taught that the same person cannot attain both God and nature
 urvashi puuchhati he, kya ishwar or prakruti do hai ?kya ishwar prakruti kaa pratibal he, uskaa pratiyogi he ?kya donon ek saath nahin chal sakate ?kya prakruti ishwar kaa shatru banakar utpann hui he ?athwa kya ishwar hi prakruti se rusht he ?prakruti or parameshwar kii ekta kii ek anubhuti, sanyas or prem ke bich santulan kii ek jhaanki maharishi chyavan ke charitra main jhalak maarthi he
 The river which is roaring restlessly inside Pururava, is clean, stable, cool and silent after coming to Chyawan
 sanyas main samaakar prem se or prem main samaakar sanyas se bachanaa jitna kathin he, sanyas or prem ke bich santulan bithaana, kadachit, usase bhi kathin kaary he
 The practice that psychology has begun to indicate is not disinterest, it is a sign of friendship with ragas; They are a sign of acceptance and coordination, not prohibition; It is not the struggle, the practice of a simple, clean, natural life
 devtaa vah nahin, jo sab kuch ko peeth dekar, sabase bhaag rahaa he
 The deity is the one, who is detached between all attachments, is dormant and disinterested even after consuming all the spruhas
 phir vahi baat ! pani par chalo, pani kaa daag nahin lage
 But, who walks on the water, he keeps from the stain of water? Is he the one who is with the Oceanic and Sukanya? Or the one who is in love with Urvashi? Is she the wife of Chyavan? Or that too, which is in the lap of Pururava? Answer to questions, the leaders of humans give solutions to diseases
 kavita kii bhoomi keval dard ko jaanati he, keval bechaini ko jaanati he, keval vaasana kii lahar or rudhir ke uttaap ko pahachaanati he
 And since the land of anguish did not end at the retirement of Pururava, the agony of Aushenri did not allow the poem to end there
 kintu, netaa-kii-si ek baat ek jagah main bhi kah gaya hum
 When Devi Sukanya thinks how to bring balance between male and female, then it comes out of her mouth that this creation is, in fact, a creation of man
 isiilie, rachayita ne purushon ke saath pakshpaat kiya, unhen swatv-haran kii pravritiyon se purna kar diya
 However, if the women start to create women, then the hardness of the man will keep going and he will become more emotional and soft
 is par aayu yah daawa karata he ki main hi to vah purush hum, jiskaa nirmaan naariyon ne kiya he
 Age was right to say
 or vah prasiddh raja bhi hua, jiskaa ullekh rugveda main aayaa he
 But, it is also mentioned that the young king Sushrava conquered the age and took him under his control
 phir vahi baat !purush kii rachana purush kare to vah traasak hota he; or purush kii rachana nari kare to ladaai main vah haar jaataa he
 The problem is of war or love, difficulties are the same everywhere
 ekaant main koi nahin maanata ki baghnakha pahananaa acha kaam he
 But, everyone comes out and wants to wear it, because more people are wearing skirts
 yukti to yahi kahati he ki naqaab pahan kar asli chehre ko chipa lene se punya nahin badhata hoga
 Nevertheless, every man uses a mask, because it is forbidden to leave the house without wearing a mask on behalf of society
 kintu, us prerana par to maine kuch kaha hi nahin jisane aath varsh tak grasit rakh kar yah kavy mujh se likhva liya
 Inexplicable subject! i cannot see it apart from myself; Perhaps, she remained unwritten; Perhaps, he pervades this book

 White House has composed the song
 film kaa ye gaanaa kanfujd brids ke liye parfect dedicket song he
 Watch the video of Laja Sharm Sang desh main non vegitarian khaane kaa shaayad hi aisa koi shaukeen ho jisane lakhanu ke tunde kebab kaa naam naa suna ho
 If a non-vegetarian wants to go to Lucknow from another city, he / she wants to go to Tunde Kabbi shop and get a taste of the paratha-kabab served there
 tunde kababi kii lakhanu main do dukaane hai- ek aminabad main or duusari chowk ke akabari get ilaake main
 This was the first time in the history of 100 years of 'tunde Kabbi' that this shop was closed due to non-supply of meat
 'aaj tak' guuruuvaar ko akabari get vaali puraani dukaan par pahunchaa to dukaan to khuli thi lekin vahaan chikan or matan ke hi kebab mil rahe the
 When the owner of the shop, Rais Ahmed, who is called by the name of Haji Sahib, spoke to him, he told that barring marriages or festivals, it was the first time that the shop remained closed on Wednesday
 unhone bataaya kibuchadkhaane bandarhane kii vajah se bade (bhens) ke gosht kii supplai nahin ho saki
 When the shop opened on Thursday, only kebabs of chicken and mutton with parathas were sold
 matan ke chaar kebab or do parathen 70 rupee main bike
 There are four chicken kebabs and two parathas for 50 rupees
 rais ahamed ne bataaya ki parathen pehle kii tarah aaj bhi 5 rupee main hi beche ja rahe hai
 But the elder's kebab was sold for 2 rupees, so now the price of chicken-mutton kebab is sitting at four to five times

 The fun of making passport photos by itself is something else
 ye kaam behad aasaan bhi he
 First of all, from your camera or phone, take a photo above the waist of someone whose passport photo is needed
 photo kheenchna sambhav nahin ho to aap pehle se pade kisi bhi photo ko passport photo main badal kar kaam chalaa sakate hai, lekin acha hoga ki ek nayaa photo khinchen
 Keeping some things in mind
 photo khinchate vakt in baton kaa rakhen khaas dhyaan- photo kisi sade, safed yaa halke rang ke bekagranud main honi chahie
 If there is no plain wall then cloth can be applied on the wall
 - camere main sidhaa dekhte hue photo len
 Take photo keeping body and face straight
 profile photo nahin chalegi
 - There should not be glasses on the face
 na najar kaa, naa dhoop kaa chashma
 - Try not to cast a shadow on the back wall
 isliye diwaar se kuch dur hat ke khadey hon
 - There should not be any shadow on the face
 iske liye sidhi tej lite se bachein
 If possible, take photos in natural light, in which flash does not have to be used
 - flash istemaal karnaa hi pade to aakhon main sidhi flash se bachein, taaki red ai (photo main aakhon kaa laal dikhnaa) kii dikkat na aae
 - Head is not covered
 topi, mafalar hataa len
 It is important to have clear eyes
 - chehre par koi bhav nahin ho to acha he
 Do not take a laughing photo
 bas ab do teen photo le len, taaki apane pasand kii sabase badhiya photo chuni ja sake
 Now transfer this photo from camera or mobile to computer
 iske liye cabel, bluetooth yaa phir drapsbox jaisi kisi bhi cloud sarvice kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 For ease, put the photo with which to make a passport photo on the desktop, that is, the screen in front of the computer
 karne ko to sab kuch mobile main bhi kiya ja saktaa he, lekin computer main photo transfar karne ke baad kaam karnaa zyada aasaan hoga

 Because no investigation is pending against former railway minister Pawan Bansal regarding this matter
 pawan bansal ne kiran kher par hamalaa bolte hue kaha he ki vah apni saakh bachaane ke liye ab idi kaa sahaara le rahi hai
 Bansal has also given a complaint to the Election Commission regarding this matter
 unhone kiran kher ke khilaaf manahani kaa daawa karne kii dhamkee bhi di he
 Anupam Kher and Kiran Kher are disillusioned with the old election promises that in Chandigarh, Kiran Kher and her actor husband Anupam Kher are on target of the people and facing opposition to the election promises
 ek ore jahaan logon ke virodh ke chalate anupam kher ko apane do kaarykram radd karne pade vahiin kai jagahon par log unako 2014 main kiye gaye chunavi vaade yaad dilaa rahe hai
 In one sector of Chandigarh, when Anupam Kher was asked about the old promises, he started walking without giving any answer
 congress ke pawan bansal, anupam kher kii patni or bijepi kii maujuuda saansad kiran kher ko chunavi jang main jabardast takkar de rahe hai
 Pawan Bansal also released a manifesto on Wednesday regarding the development of Chandigarh

 chandigarh main ek kaarykram main shaamil hone aae kanhaiya kumaar ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ke khilaaf bolnaa na to deshadroh he or na hi bhartiya sena kii mukhaalafat
 Kanhaiya Kumar said that the Republic is neither an affection for any ideology nor any political party
 tajmahal ko kabristaan kahe jane ke sawaal par pratikriya dete hue kanhaiya kumaar ne kaha ki taj mahal ko uske naam se nahin, balki uski khubsuurati se aakarshith hokar lakhon log use dekhne aate hai
 Kanhaiya said that call Taj Mahal as Taj Mahal, Teju Mahal, call it Moti Mahal or Modi Mahal, but it will remain only Taj Mahal
 narayan rane ko bijepi main shaamil kiye jane par kanhaiya ne bijepi par tanj kasate hue kaha ki jab tak vah jab congress main the to bhrashtachari the lekin ab bijepi main shaamil ho kar sab thik ho gaya he

 Airtel and Vodafone Idea will be fined Rs 3,050 crore for not giving interconnection to Reliance Jio
 digital communication kamishan (DCC) ne is maamle main TRAI kii sifarish ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had recommended the imposition of this penalty on both telecom operators
 reliance jeeyo ne TRAI main yah shikaayat kii thi ki uske network ke 75 fisadi kol isliye fail ho ja rahe hai, kyonki airtel, vodaphone or idia ne use paryaapt sankhya main interconection point nahin die
 Based on this complaint, in October 2016, TRAI recommended a penalty
 doorsanchaar sachiv aruna sundarrajan ne kaha, 'disisi ne airtel, vodaphone-idia par jurmaane kii sifarish ko sweekaar kar liya he
 Now DCC will send this recommendation to the competent authority of the government
 ' tri ne airtel or vodaphone, prayek par 1,050 karod rupee kaa jurmaana or idia par 950 karod rupee kaa jurmaana lagane kii baat kahi thi
 Vodafone and Idea have merged in August 2018, so it will suffer the biggest blow, because now this company will have to pay a fine of Rs 2,000 crore
 khabar he ki disisi ne pichley maheene hi yah sweekaar kar liya tha ki airtel or vodaphone-idia par dand lagaaya jaae, lekin usne tri se kaha tha ki vah is par vichaar kare ki kya 3,050 karod kii jurmaana raashi main kuch kami kii ja sakati he, kyoki is sector kii haalat thik nahin he
 But TRAI denied the change, saying that it would run according to the provisions of the TRAI Act
 us samay tri in companiyon ke doorsanchaar license radd karne par bhi vichaar kar rahaa tha, lekin usne aisa nahin kiya
 The regulator said that this would cause great inconvenience to customers

 Video- 'contradiction in the statement of former President of France' dilli ke nagar nigam chunaav ke liye sabhi raajnneetik partiyaan vaadon kii jhadi laga rahi hai
 Such dreams are being shown to the voters, as if the Delhi Corporation will become Shanghai after the elections
 shaayad pehali baar hoga jab kisi nagar nigam chunaav kii raajnneeti ek loksabhaa chunaav ke raajnneetik muddon par hoti dikh rahi he
 However, the ground reality is that the first and foremost responsibility of corporations in any state is to keep the city clean
 dilli main alag-alag kaam kii jimmedaari kai agenciyon par he, jiske chalate aksar vivaad khadey hote hai or isi vajah se ek agency apane kaam kaa thikra duusare ke sar phodtii rahati hai
 Like other municipal corporations, the biggest responsibility of the Bhinagar Corporation in Delhi is to keep the capital clean, remove garbage and save the city from diseases
 pichley 10 saal se bhi zyada samay takbhartiya janata party dilli ke nagar nigam par shashan kiya
 Now the election is on the head, so the BJP is showing dreams again, but in the last 10 years on the ground, the cleanliness pole is opening up the pictures, in which the garbage spread on the road is making Delhi a hub of diseases
 centre main bijepi kii sarkaar ne svachh bharat abhiyaan shuru kiya, lekin hamaare reality check main yahi baat nikal kar ai ki bijepi shasit nagar nigam ne dilli ko kooday kaa dher bana diya he
 To investigate the claims of cleanliness of the corporation, we started the reality check from Mayur Vihar Phase One in East Delhi
 yahaan sadak par bikharaa kooda, badboo or mackhiyon se bharaa hua mila
 The second stop for the cleanliness reality check was Chilla village near Mayur Vihar
 sthaneey nivasee rajvir singh kehete hai safai nahin hoti or is kooday ke chalate logon kaa jeena mushkil he
 Even if you complain, there is no hearing from anyone
 dilli main safai kii hakeekat jaanane ke liye iske baad ajtak kii team pahunchi kalyaan puri
 Like the poor people of two-thirds of Delhi, there are no big cells here, but there is a large population which forms a vote bank for political parties in every election, but there is no one to listen to their needs
 nagar nigam se kitni shikaayatein hai, lekin nigam ke kaanon par jun bhi nahin rengti
 Garbage, mosquito flies and odor in these streets are everyday for the people around
 ilaake ke log is gandagi kii vajah se kaaphi naaraaz hai
 Neither do they know how to complain, nor has the corporation ever corrected them
 khanaapurti ke naam par upar kaa kooda uthaa liya jaataa he or neeche kaa kooda kalyaan puri ke logon kii kismat ban jaataa he
 The next stop for the realty check was the corporation's house in Kalyan Puri
 peeche ki rihaishi ilaake main jane vaali sadak kooday ke dher main dabi thi
 When you see the camera, expect people have brought complaints
 vahi puraani shikaayat kin nigam main sunwaayee nahin hoti
 People complained that diseases have surrounded people due to this garbage
 baat karte samay hi nigam kaa ek karmchaaree bhi saamne aayaa, jo khud nigam kii hi andekhi kaa shikaar ho gaya he
 Recently, the first outbreak of mosquitoes led to chikungunya
 vah bhi yah maanate dikhe ki nagar nigam main sunwaayee nahin hoti, jiske chalate dilli kooday kaa dher bani he
 All three parties of Delhi are campaigning loudly
 kalyaan puri se nigam parshad ke liye bijepi ke ummidavaar manoj mehara kaa karyaalay to nagar nigam ke kooday kii ek dhalaav ke thik saamne he
 When asked the question of why there is no cleanliness, Netaji's first answer was that it is Sunday and the sanitation workers did not come
 unase jab poocha ki agar bijepi phir nigam kii satta main ai to aage tasviir kaise badalegi, to netaji ne kaha pradhanmantri ne aashwaasan diya he ki aap aisa sidhaa nigamon ko diya jayega

 'unhone kaha, 'mujhe is baat ko apane dimag se baahar nikaalnaa padaa or apane desh kaa netritv karnaa padaa
 i could not even tell my coach and the union
 mere kuch kareebi doston ko hi is bare main pataa tha
 Mikel played for 90 minutes in this match
 haalanki argentina ne nigeria ko 2-1 se haraa diya tha
 Mikel said, 'I was told that if i told this to someone, they would kill my father
 main is baat ko coach ke saath bhi saajha nahin kar paaya tha, kyonki main nahin chahta tha ki koi bakheda khadaa ho
 The captain said, 'my father returned safely on Monday
 main police kaa madad karne ke liye dhanyavad detaa hum

 In the northeastern area of delhi, people came out of their houses on Friday night to talk about the unknown shadow that strikes from behind
 darasal, yah dar ek serial bladebaj kaa he
 The shocking thing is that he is accompanied by a girl, who hides her face and runs away with the blood
 khaas baat yah bhi ki uski waar se ghayal har ek shaks yuva he
 a PCR call was received from Ambedkar township of Maujpur at 9:30 pm on Friday night in Zafarabad
 kol karne vaale ne kaha ki ek ladkaa ambedkar gali main dhardaar hathiyaar se logon ko maar rahaa he
 Before the police reached the spot, both the anonymous man and a girl with him escaped from there
 ghayal akaash ne bataaya ki vah ambedkar gali kaa rahane vaala he or apane saathi ke saath daftar se laut rahaa tha, tabhi kisi se dhardaar hathiyaar se us par waar kar diya
 According to the sources at the Jafrabad police station, Sirfire and eccentric bloodballs made a total of 6 people to be killed in Jaffrabad's Shiv Mandir Gali, Ambedkar Gali, Gali No-5, Gali No-7 and Gali No-11
 jabaki chashmadidon main ek ravi kaa kahana he ki ghayalon kii sankhya 17 se adhik he
 Ravi told that the boy was a medium-sized boy and he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt while the girl with him was wearing a mask
 baharhaal, philhal bladebaj joda faraar he, jabaki log khaufjada hai
 There are many questions in this mind from people to the police, what is the purpose behind doing this? Are both angry about anything? After all, why are boys being targeted? Much more, but the police is silent and the investigation continues

 "mogambo Khush Hua" 14 long years it's been since you went to heaven but strangely it feels like you're right here with me
 You guide me at each step, teach me fearlessness and give me the power to dream
 You taught me that everything is possible in life and that family comes first
 i will make you proud

 It's a thing so rare to take birth in a family that goes down in history because of the craft, hardwork, talent & relentless spirit of one man
 i feel blessed to be grandson to a legendary grandfather, a human being par excellence and an artist who the world celebrates
 We grandchildren lovingly called him ‘dadu'
 Our granddad fit the bill of a 'complete man' to the tee
 His paternalistic nature won hearts
 He was all inclusive
 He loved, cared for & helped all those he came in touch with
 He was the ultimate father figure
 He claimed that the best days of his life were not the days that won him praise or awards but the days his grand children were born
 He doted on us
 He'd spend time with us, playing, photographing every smile that flashed on our faces & videographed every little nuance of ours
 He'd even record every new word we spoke when we were learning to talk babies
 We miss you dadu
 Thank you for being you and thank you for blessing and guiding us everyday
 i know you are with us - i can feel your presence

 She felt that her face is not beautiful enough to become an actress

 The comments shruti ne kaha, "main hameshaa se ek abhinetri bananaa chaahati thi, lekin mujhe lagata tha ki main khubasurat nahin hum
 i used to run around here and there in the sun and think that heroines are so beautiful, how can i be beautiful
 lekin man main hameshaa cinema main aane kii khwaahish thi
 i wanted to act and become a singer
 " Shruti had made her Bollywood debut with the film 'luck', and now two more films 'D Day' and 'ramaiya Vasta Vaiya' are going to be released soon
 vah kahati hai ki vah is baat se khush hai ki unki aane vaali donon filmein alag-alag vishyon par aadhaarit hai or unka kirdaar ek-duusare se kaaphi alag he
 Shruti said, "I always wanted to be an actress, but i used to think that i am not beautiful
 main hameshaa dhoop main yahaan vahaan bhaagti-phirti rahati thi or sochati thi ki heroine to itani khubasurat hoti hai, main kaise khubasurat ho sakati hum
 But i always wanted to come to the cinema

 Flipkart's Big Billion Day Sale made headlines, but it was more successful than the sale
 kareeb 600 karod kaa saamaan bechakar bhi flipcart graahakon ke bharose par khari nahin utari
 The out-of-stock product increased people's anger and this anger was also seen on Flipkart's page on social networking sites
 ant main company ke head ne baqayada mail jari kar logon se maafi maangi
 However, in the world of cell, with Flipkart many more companies are also rapidly pulling customers
 flipcart ke big billian de cell ke din hi snapdil bhi kareeb 600 karod ke product bechney main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Companies like Amazon, ebay are adopting new ways to attract customers
 aamejan ke epiness de main to baqayada ap istemaal karne waalon ke liye cell kaa mauka aayaa or company ne kai tarah ke inaamon kaa elaan bhi kiya, to vahiin snapdil ke sevings de main kai baar website krash hone kii khabaren ain
 That is, the magic of online sales in the people remains intact, but the big question is of credibility, which can be made in the online market on its own
 takneekee rup se bharat main sidhe online ritel bijnes kii ijazat nahin he
 They provide portals of companies on the Internet that want to sell their products
 tab sawaal uthta he ki kya badi online companiyaan quality check or product ke graahakon tak sahi salaamat pahunchane par gambhir hai
 Because when the news comes that soap is sent on mobile order, the question is justified
 yah haal tab he jabaki is desh main abhi bhi sirf 15 log hi internet conection kaa istemaal karte hai or online ritel bazaar kaa hissaa kul ritel bazaar kaa ek fisadi se bhi kam he
 It is not that online stuff was not available before, but people did not trust to the extent it is today
 agar jo utpaada dikhegaa vah nahin milegaa yaa phir uski quality acchhee nahin hogi
 Then it will be very difficult to stop the customers, that is, what will be seen will be sold only online and only then the e-commerce market will last

 Vivekananda asked him to walk the path of compassion of Lord Buddha
 swami bole, us mahaan vyakti kaa anusaran karo, jisane 500 baar janm lekar apana jivan lokkalyaan ke liye samarpit kiya or phir buddhatv praapt kiya

 tahalaka kii mahila patrkaar kaa do baar yon utpeedan karne vaale sampadak tarun tejpal ke khilaaf goa police ne jaanch shuru kar di he
 Police will soon send summons to Tarun for questioning
 november ke duusare saptaah main tahalaka ke salanaa jalse think 2013 ke dauraan jis hotel main tarun tejpal ne mahila patrkaar kaa yon shoshan kiya, uski footage goa police ne khangaalani shuru kar di he
 Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar said in the conversation till date that instructions have been given to the police, investigation will be done and if the complaint is found correct, then lawful action will be taken
 manohar ne ye saaf kar diya ki mahila patrkaar bhale hi police main shikaayat na kare, lekin phir bhi karrwai jarur kii jaaegi kyonki yah sidhe taur par aparaadh he, jisamen police sangyaan le sakati he
 The Women's Commission may also investigate the case, the National Commission for Women (NCW) said on Thursday that if a case of alleged sexual harassment of a woman journalist was raised by Tarun Tejpal, the editor-in-chief of news magazine Tehelka, she would investigate the matter
 Will do
 mahila ayog kii adhyaksh mamata sharma ne kaha, 'ek baar maamla rashtriya mahila ayog ke paas laayaa jaae, to ham jaanch kar yah sunishchit karenge ki aaropee doshi paaya jaataa he, to use sajaa ho
 He will have to appear in court
 ' sharma ne tejpal dwaara tahalaka ke mukhya sampadak ke pad se chah maheene ke liye tyaagptr dene kii ghoshnaa par kaha, 'tarun tejpal bhagwaan nahin hai, jo khud apni kerani kii sajaa tay karenge
 The woman journalist also told a news channel that she was deeply disappointed by the response of Tehelka's top leadership on the entire episode
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki tahalaka ke duusare saathiyon ko sirf tarun tejpal kii pratikriya bataai gai
 My complaint was not explained in detail
 gauratlab he ki tahalaka ke sampadak tarun tejpal dwaara hue yon utpeedan kii jab mahila patrkaar ne shikaayat kii, to tarun ne maafee maangane ke baad khud ko bataur praayshchit chah maheene ke liye patrika ke sampadan se alag kar liya
 Even after this, they are being criticized everywhere and demanding legal action against them
 is maang kaa aadhaar he, vah mail jo peedit ne apni prabandh sampadak ko bheja or ab sibar world main circulet ho rahaa he
 Its counter-mail is also being shared extensively
 ham aaj tak ke pathakon ko in donon mail ke jaruri hisse bataa rahe hai
 What woman journalist wrote, her complaint Mail Mendier Shoma (managing editor of Tehelka) It is very painful for me to write you this email
 jo baat main kehane ja rahi hum, use kaise saral dhang se kaha jaae, ye sochane main lagi hui thi, magar yahi ek rasta samaj aa rahaa he
 Last week, Tehelka editor-in-chief Tarun Tejpal sexually assaulted me twice during a think
 jab unhone pehali baar ye harakat kii, to main tumhen fouran phone kar bataanaa chaahati thi
 Or find you face to face and tell you what Tarun has done to me
 magar us vakt tum think ke aayojan main buree tarah se vyast thi
 i knew that it was not possible even for a minute at that time that i could tell you about this act alone
 iske alaava main sakate main thi ki ye ghinauni harakat tarun tejpal ne kii he
 The same Tarun, who has worked with my father, is his friend
 vahi tarun, jinaki beti meri dost he
 The same Tarun whom i have respected for so many years for his work
 tarun ne do baar meraa yon shoshan kiya
 Every time i came back to my room feeling desperate and battered and wept there trembling
 iske baad main apane sahakarmiyon ke kamare main gai or ek varisht sahakarmi ko phone kar is bare main sab kuch bataa diya
 When Tarun sexually assaulted me for the second time, i complained about this to his daughter
 jab unki beti ne tarun se is babat sawaal jawaab kiya, to vah mujh par cheekhte hue gussane lage
 i avoided Tarun during the entire Think Festival
 sirf tabhi unke saamne ai, jab aasapaas kai log maujuud rahe hon
 The sequence lasted until this fest was over
 shanivaar kii shaam unhone mujhe ek shaatirapane se bharaa esemes kiya, jisamen likhaa ki maine ek sharaabi kii dillagi ko galat samaj liya or uskaa ulta hi arth nikaal liya
 But this is not true
 dillagi ke dauraan koi kisi par yon hamalaa nahin karata
 i am sending every detail of his action to you, so that you understand how painful it must have been for me
 kitna mushkil rahaa hoga apane saath hue is haadase ke bare main aapako bataanaa
 And how important it is for Tehelka to create an anti-sexual retention cell according to Vishaka instructions
 main chaahati hum ki yahi cell is masale kii jaanch kare
 And finally i apologize in writing to Tarun Tejpal
 ye maafinama tahalaka main kaam karne vaale har karmchaaree se saajha kiya janaa chahie
 The way he treated a female employee cannot be tolerated at all
 (is email main kai patrakaron ke naam kaa zikr hua, jinhen yon utpeedan ke maamalon main apanaai jane vaali guideline ke tahat nahin likhaa gaya he
 ) Here is the reply of Tarun Tejpal, Deere Showmay, the last few days have been a test for me and i fully take responsibility for it
 faisla lene main hui phislan bhari chook he ye
 i detected the situation in a very ugly way
 iske chalate yah durbhagyapurna vakya hua, jo un tamaam mulyon ke khilaaf he, jinamein ham yakeen karte hai or jinke liye ladate rahe hai
 i have already apologized to the journalist associated with this case unconditionally for my bad behavior
 magar mujhe lagata he ki abhi or praayshchit karnaa hoga
 i have made Tehelka with my blood, sweat and tears every day
 is kaam main mere karibiyon kii bhi itani hi mehnat rahi he
 It has fought many difficult and urgent battles of our time
 hameshaa peedit ke saath khadaa rahaa he, hamen nyaay kaa paksh liya he
 In the worst of times, i have kept and saved Tehelka and its journalists free from the establishment and other corporate pressures
 maine hameshaa ye mana he ki tahalaka naam kaa sanghathan or iskaa kaam kisi bhi vyakti se zyada mahatvapurn he
 And in such a situation it is very tragic that by taking a wrong decision, i myself have hurt my high values
 chunki yah maamla tahalaka kaa he, isile mujhe lagata he ki sirf kuch shabd bolkar praayshchit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 i will have to go through such harsh punishment that tear my rip
 isliye main yah prastaavit karata hum ki tahalaka ke sampadak kii padavi or iske daftar se main chah maheene ke liye dur rahun
 Shoma Tum has always been the main pillar of this organization
 main tumse or sabhi karmchaariyon se maafee maangata hum
 i am entrusting the scarecrow in your capable hands

 The risk of breast cancer in girls is increasing due to deteriorating lifestyle

 Statistics from AIIMS show that the number of young patients in cancer patients coming for treatment in AIIMS is increasing continuously
 sammelan main doctoron kaa kahana tha ki jis tarah se mahanaharon main yuva ladke-ladakiyon kaa lifestil kharaab hota ja rahaa he
 Late night parties, increased consumption of alcohol and cigarettes, eating means junk food and lack of maximum exercise are all pushing the youth towards the risk of cancer
 ames main cancer vibhaag ke head dow ji ke rath ne bataaya ki ames main cancer ke wo marij zyada bad rahe hai, jinhen kharaab lifestil ke kaaran cancer hua he
 For example, breast and lung cancer, he said that in the last five years, due to poor lifestyle, cancer cases have increased by 2 to 3 percent
 aankadon kii maane to, dilli or duusare mahanagaron main har saal prati ek lakh main lagbhag 120 log cancer ke shikaar ban rahe hai
 Breast and lung cancer are the highest among them

 According to Dr PK Julka, head of the Radiology Department of AIIMS, it takes 10 to 15 years for any cancer to develop, it can be easily guessed at how young the lifestyle of boys and girls pushed them towards diseases
 Has been isliye agar aap chaahate hai ki breast or langs cancer aapaki jindagi main dakhal naa den to aaj se hi apni lifestil main badlaav karnaa shuru kar dijie

 This will reduce the thrill of the game

 In the remaining time, no more than four fielders can remain outside the circle of 30 yards

 Dravid says it is a good thing to have 14 teams in the tournament

 By linking it with small workers, the BJP wants to reach out to the poor sections so that the gritty on pakoras can be associated with the respect of the poor sections

 In this, Congress leaders have left no stone unturned in the true sense

 Delhi BJP has scheduled a Bhoomi Pujan at the Japanese Park in Rohini at 11 am on 19 September
 narendra modi kii raily se pehle sabha sthal par bhoomi pujan is tarah kiya jayega maano vahaan 29 sitambar ko bijepi ke bhagwaan avatarit hone vaale hai
 The tradition of flattery in the BJP towards Modi was followed by his hat-trick victory in the Gujarat assembly elections
 jisaki baangi kai netaaon ke bayanon main jhalak chuki he
 National President Rajnath Singh himself has been one of the most popular leaders since the first day of his new innings
 haalanki unke is bayaan ko sushamaa swaraj sareekhe netaa kai baar nijee raay bataakar khaarij bhi kar chuki hai

 Alia Bhatt's mother and actress Soni Razdan has expressed disappointment over not taking actors of the right age in the film bull's eye
 soni se pehle nina gupta ne bhi film main actors kii casting par apni raay di thi
 Speaking to Quinte, Sony said, 'I love both of them (taapsee Pannu and Bhumi Pednekar), but why? i think you have to think about the box office, but then why make a 60-year-old man's story when you can't take the real 60-year-old people in it? Actually, Taapsee Pannu in the film Bull's Eye and The land has been taken to Pednekar
 in donon hi actresses kii umr 30 saal or usase kuch zyada hai
 While in the film, both are playing the role of shooter aged 60 years

 So keeping a director tied while making a film is also not right
 aise main badi umr ke actors ke liye aajkal kaam itnaa kam ho gaya he ki kisi ko bhi bura mahasoos hona laazmi he
 'let me tell you that before Sony Razdan, actress Neena Gupta had tweeted that she would love if older actors are taken to play old characters in the industry
 nina ne ek coment ke jawaab main ye baat kahi thi

 maharashtra-haryana main fail hua bijepi kaa formulayupi, bihar jaise rajyon main pai thi safaltajharkhand, dilli, bihar main hogi chunautimaharashtra main sarkaar banane kii prakriya, har ghante badalati raajnneetik ghatnaon ne to ek baat saaf kar di he ki bijepi kii mahatvakankshi "exklujan policy" fail ho gai he
 If we look at the bjp's strategy, then it is known that in every state, the idea of an effective or, say, "excluding" the domineering castes and mobilizing other castes to get votes initially gave tremendous success to the BJP
 lekin ab vaise parinaam nahin aa rahe hai, jiske kaaran bijepi disambar 2017 main desh ke 71% bhu-bhaag par raaj karne vaali party se mahaj do saalon main yani 2019 ke november bitate-bitate 40% par simat gai he
 And this is confirmed by at least the recent Haryana and Maharashtra elections
 haryana ke pichley chunaav main main bijepi ne majboot anti jat voters ko target kar kabhi dabang rahe jat netaaon kii dukaan par taala laga diya tha
 But this time it could not happen
 shaayad jat voters is chaal ko samaj gaye or is baar ek hokar unhone dushyant chautaala or bhupendra singh hooda ko vot kar bijepi ko chautaala parivaar ke saamne ghutane techne par majaboor kar diya
 What happened in Haryana? Like Haryana, BJP succeeded in forming the government in 2014 by targeting the non-maratha voters, bypassing the strong Maratha lobby in Maharashtra
 lekin is baar maharashtra main bhi vahi hua jo haryana main hua tha
 Despite being the largest party and oldest partner, Devendra Fadnavis could not become CM and the BJP lost to the ncp-congress in front of the Maratha Pride
 bijepi kii is exklujan kii policy kaa test abhijharkhand, bihar or upimen dekhnaa baaki he
 In Jharkhand, non-tribals, and in Bihar and UP, BJP similarly succeeded in forming the government by targeting the Yadavs and targeting non-yadav voters
 jharkhand main apanaaya gaya yahi formula!jharkhand par gaur karen to yahaan 25% adivasee or 7% kii muslim aabaadi ko counter karne ke liye godda main liching kaa mudda ubhaara gaya, taaki voton kaa dhruvikaran hindu-muslim ke aadhaar par kiya ja sake
 The BJP focused on 5% forward castes, 11% Dalits and more than 50% OBC voters, against 32% of tribal and Muslim votes
 50% se bhi zyada obisi voters main agar yadavon or anya ko gata bhi den to bhi bijepi is tabake se ek badi aabaadi ko hindu-muslim ke aadhaar par apane paksh main vot lene main safal rahi he
 The SP-BSP alliance failed in Uttar Pradesh and in spite of the alliance of Akhilesh and Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh, if the BJP won and both of them lost badly, then here too the bjp's policy of exit worked
 bijepi ne yahaan bhi akhilesh ke kor yadav or mayawati ke jatav voter ko chhodkar gaiyr-yadav or gaiyr-jatav ko apane paksh main karne main kamyaabi hasil kii
 Due to which BJP got landslide victory in both assembly and Lok Sabha and Akhilesh lost badly even though he was identified as working CM
 bihar main bhi nahin chalaa MY kaa jadoousi tarah bihar main 34% "MY", pichhadaa or ati-pichhadaa voton ke sameekaran ke dam par laluraj hilaanaa mushkil nahin tha, kyonki 34% main akele yadav, 14% or muslim 20% ek saath 34% hokar majboot ‘my’sameekaran banaate hai
 But under the same exclusion policy, the BJP was successful in registering its success here too
 bihar main bijepi ne yadav ko akele chhod anya obisi varg ko saadhane kii koshish kii
 In non-yadav, OBC, BJP made its way by duping Nitish and Ram Vilas Paswan in non-yadav, OBC and Dalit votes
 ab dekhnaa yahi he ki kya aane vaale samay main bijepi kii exklujan policy kaa yahi haal hoga, jo haryana or maharashtra main hua? jharkhand main to chunaav ho rahe hai, vahiin bihar main agle saal, to upi main 2022 main vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai
 Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar has expressed hope that the monsoon session of Parliament, starting on Monday, will go smoothly
 mira kumaar ne 15veen loksabhaa ke aaj se shuru ho rahe aathven satr ke liye aaj sadan main pravesh karte samay samvaadadaataaon ke sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki unhen puri ummid he ki aaj se shuru ho rahaa sansad kaa monsoon satr sucharu rup se chalegaa
 Regarding this session, it is feared that there will be a lot of noise in this session
 kam se kam shuruuaati kuch din koi kaamkaaj nahin ho paayegaa or ye baithken hangaame kii bhent chadh jaaengi
 The Prime Minister, however, appealed to the Opposition this morning to cooperate in resolving various issues pending before the nation in this session of Parliament
 unhone aashwast kiya ki sarkaar vipaksh dwaara uthaaye jane vaale kisi bhi mudde par vistrut charchaa ke liye taiyaar he
 Sushma Swaraj had said on Sunday that the opposition wants the Parliament to run
 vipaksh aam aadmi ko pareshaan karne vaali manhagaai, chaaron taraf faile bhrashtachar, mumbai aatanki hamale se sambandhit aantarik suraksha ke maamle, telugana kii bigadati sthiti, barabaad hoti ja rahi air india or naksalwad aadi ke mudde uthaanaa chahta he
 Notices have also been given to discuss these
 vipaksh kii netaa ne kaha tha ki iske alaava america ke saath parmaanu samjhaute ke sandarbh main lagaai gai nai sharto or srilanka dwaara bhartiya machuaaron par badhate hamale jaise antarrashtriya muddon par bhi vipaksh ne charchaa ke notice die hai
 BJP, AIADMK and Left parties are planning a strategy to target both of them in view of the allegations leveled against the jailed former Telecom Minister a Raja against the Prime Minister and Home Minister p Chidambaram in the 2G spectrum case
 lokapal vidheyak ke praaroop ko lekar bhi sarkaar or vipaksh ke bich takaraav kii ashanka he
 The government intends to introduce this bill on August 3
 is vidheyak ke daayre main pradhanmantri ko laae jane ke bare main samprag main ek raay nahin he
 The Opposition's strategy is also visible to the ruling party and that's why yesterday the Prime Minister almost laughed the opposition saying that he is not afraid of anything, because the opposition has many embarrassing secrets
 udhar vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne chunauti di thi ki pradhanmantri ke tarkash main jitne tir hai, chalaa kar dekh len or kal dekhenge ki koun kis par waar karata he

 ' About 200 km from the capital Delhi, in the narrow streets of the small town of Saharanpur in western Uttar Pradesh, Mohammad Mazhar is looking for new inspiration for his next collection in the traditional embroidery work of the embroiderers
 is 29 saal ke yuvak ne lackme fishan wyk main do baar apane kaam kaa pradarshan kiya he or unhen sabase shandaar jeconext fishan dizinron main se ek mana gaya tha
 But they are satisfied working from Saharanpur itself and have no intention of moving to a big city
 ve apane iraade ko vaazib tehraate hue kehete hai ki unhen apni diginon ke liye afsane or sandarbh yahaan mil jate hai
 They resist the established notions of a high-profile career, and the biggest thing is that they have the potential to put this small town on the fashion map of the country
 yah sab us vakt shuru hua jab nauveen kaksha main pard rahe mazhar ne skool main apane ek senior ke saath milakar ek boutique sthapit kiya
 The father of that senior also had a boutique
 mazhar kaa pehla collection dhobighat 2017 main aayaa
 It engraved memories associated with his city
 kapade dhone kaa kaam karne vaali mahila sakina begum unke yahaan lagaataar aati thim or kapadon par chota-sa nishaan bana detii thim
 So Mazhar's collection had white markings on which Sakina and 30 other women inscribed on clothes to create a design
 unke agle collection main rafugaron kii kala yani rafu ke nishaan kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 He says, "my inspiration is Indian artisans, especially those who indirectly contribute to the fashion industry, such as Dhobi and Rafugar
 ''saharanpur lakdi ke hastshilp ke liye janaa jaataa he or mazhar kaa parivaar bhi usee kaam main laga he
 He says, "being from a traditional Muslim family, it was not easy for me to say that i wanted to be a designer
 '' ve apana label rashtriya rojgaar kaarykram ke tahat chalaa rahe hai or kareeb 70 log unke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 His designs reflect the life of the small town and the mannerisms of the artisans there
 rahul mishra bhi paris fishan wyk main pradarshit apane collection main apane gaanv malhousie ko yaad karte hai
 Old memories also emerge as a significant force in his designs
 unka bachapan main kai chizon se bada gahan rishta tha—takiyon ke gilaaf, parde, mezposh, daadi kii dhoti kii safedi, chota-sa talab, os kii boonden or uttar pradesh ke unke chote se gaanv ke bunakaron or kasaayiyon kii lungiyon ke safed tathaa nile chaukhaane—ab ve sab ek diziner ke taur par unki kahaniyon kaa hissaa hai
 Designers coming from small cities have been shaping Indian fashion, but they have made delhi-mumbai their base
 masalan, bihar main jamalpur ke paas ek choti-si jagah se aane vaale samant chouhan hon yaa phir ro mango ke sanjay garg
 But there is also a group of designers who are working in small cities and spreading their skills through social media and e-commerce
 masalan, kerala ke kochi ke 32 varshiya srijith jivan kehete hai ki ve "anfaishning'' kii ore bad rahe hai or dhimi gati se chalane vaali jindagi kaa anand hi unke dizin ko prerana detaa he
 He says, "we are running so fast that sometimes we don't even have time for small things like rain drops and bird chirping
 ''desh kii fishan rajdhani se dur rahane kaa thodaa nuksaan jarur hota he, par ghar ke ehsaas kii baat hi kuch or hoti he, aisi jagah kaam karnaa jise aap jaanate-samajhate hai
 Jeevan, who studied at the National Institute of Design (NID) Ahmedabad and ENSAD Paris, says, "today fashion is everywhere
 vah sirf metro shaharon tak simit nahin he
 My stories have local fragrance for global customers
 '' unhone 2013 main apana label rauka shuru kiya
 He has helped flood-affected weavers in Kerala stand on their feet by introducing Origins along with some other designers
 tikaoo fishan or shilp ab is udyog ke nae sutara banate ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is no surprise that designers are exploring their past experiences and fixing new design terminology
 usamen ve na sirf apni saamaajik chetana ko shaamil kar rahe hai balki sthaneey kaarigari or sandarbhon ke saath innovative hone kii jarurat bhi mahasoos kar rahe hai
 For example, Bihar's social entrepreneur and designer Praveen Chauhan has started a social venture in Bodh Gaya near his native place - mother-madarli-luxury-artistry
 neshnal institute of fishan technology (nift) main pard chuke praveen mahabodhi mandir se phulon kaa kachra ikattha karte hai or unhen kathi williams ke saath milakar prakritik daai main badal dete hai
 Kathy is Australian and the founder of "sickness of Nature", a sustainable label
 in donon ne milakar happy hands project sthapit kiya he
 Says Praveen, "it is the artisans who have kept our art and culture alive
 in kaarigaron ne mujhe rachanaatmakataa ke alag hi str par pahunchaa diya he
 Now many people from other countries contact me to study traditional Indian textiles and handicrafts
 ''happy hands project bodhgaya mandir prabandhan samiti, matra or bikoj of nechar kii sanyukt pahal he
 The objective is to provide sustainable employment to the people through the use of natural dye on Khadi and to boost the skills of artisans
 jab praveen ne nickrat mang daakhila liya to logon ne unka majaak udaaya tha ki ve itnaa paisa kharch karke darji kaa kaam sikh rahe hai
 But his contractor father supported him in every situation
 aaj praveen ko khaadi ko phir se lokapriy karne kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 Vijayalakshmi Nachiyar, 48, was born into a "kachchi" family, so she had to enter the world of embroidery and clothing at an early age
 unke parivaar ne peedhishon se kapadon kaa vyapaar kiya he
 She graduated in Textiles and Clothing from SNDT Women's University, Mumbai
 shaadi ke baad ve coimbatore ke bahari ilaake pollachi main bas gayi
 Pollachi is an agricultural area and there is a long tradition of weaving cotton saris
 unke pati ne contract farming ke jariye 2005 main ichological kapaas kii kheti shuru kii
 In 2008 Nachiar established a handloom studio and in 2009 became the co-founder of Ethicus
 ve bataati hai, "ithicus main main jo kuch bhi kar paa rahi hum, vah is vajah se ki main chote shahar se hum
 It would have been impossible to do this in a big city
 yahaan mere paas apni production suvidha he or sthaneey karigar bhi kaam kar rahe hai
 When he started Ithicus, the handloom brands were few and the challenges too high
 ve bataati hai ki log silk ke liye oonchi keemat dene ko taiyaar the par achche coton ke liye nahin
 The Textile Exchange has ranked his venture among a select few brands worldwide that use 100% sustainable raw materials and also adopt sustainable methods of production
 saal 2012 main textiles exange ne unhen "future shaper'' award or 2017 main round teble of india ne unhen "pride of tamilnadu'' award diya
 The story of Naushad Ali is also similar
 33 varshiya ali kehete hai, "mere pita kapadaa vyapaaree the
 Bundles of clothes from every corner of the country were packed in our house and i used to help my father tagging them
 kapadon or fishan se meri pahchaan vahiin se hui
 "he was not sure that he would be accepted as a designer, so when he started his label in Puducherry, he gave himself five years
" ali kehete hai, "ham alag tarah se ek sasteneble label banane ke liye patibaddh hai
 Being part of fashion, the world's second most polluting industry, i want to make my decisions carefully, from the selection of raw materials to deciding what to make from it

 Today the whole country is celebrating the 72nd Independence Day
 hindustan ke har kone main aazaadee ke taraane baj rahe hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hoist the tricolor at the Red Fort and all the leaders of the opposition and opposition have arrived to participate in this celebration
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi swatantraaa diwas manaane laal kila pahunche hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi was seen sitting in the front row among all the veps
 dilachasp baat ye he ki beete ganatantr diwas (26 janvari, 2017) samaaroh memrajpath par rahul gandhiko agali pankti main jagah nahin mili thi
 Which was the subject of discussion
 rahul gandhi ko vishesh mehmaanon kii pehali pankti main jagah milane ko congress ne mudda banaaya tha
 The party had objected to giving place to Rahul Gandhi in the fourth and then the sixth row, bypassing the traditions
 haalanki, unki sitting vyavastha par baad main suraksha kaa hawala diya gaya tha
 Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad was also seen in the Rajya Sabha during the Republic Day Parade with Rahul Gandhi
 haalanki, aaj swatantraaa diwas ke avasar par rahul gandhi pehali pankti main dikhe, lekingulaam nabi ajaadaaj bhi peeche dikhaai die
 Many leaders including former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda arrived to attend the Independence Day celebrations
 rahul gandhi kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ke paas baithe dikhaai die
 His foreign outings are haunted by jokes
 kyonki jab unki sabase zyada jarurat hoti, ve gaayab ho jate the
 However, after becoming the party president this year, Rahul Gandhi decided to spend his first Christmas in Delhi after years of meeting with Congress leaders
 mana ja rahaa he ki unhone dubai kii apni yatra or 26 disambar ko bahrain main hindustani kaarobaariyon ke saath netwarking kaa ek aayojan taal diya he
 The reason? The Parliament is in session and will run till 5 January
 to kya kahen, der aayad
 
 
 The rahul gandhi ne sargical strike ko lekar piem modi par nishaanaa kya saadhaa puri bijepi rahul gandhi or congress ke khilaaf utar gai
 BJP MP Manoj Tiwari said that the country had gone into the abyss under Congress rule
 manoj tiwari ne kaha ki javaanon ke khun kii dallali sambandhi apane bayaan ke liye rahul gandhi ko maafee maangani chahie
 Question- Rahul Gandhi has said that Modi has brokered the blood of jawans, how do we see this statement? Manoj Tiwari - Today we have a lot of pity for Rahul Gandhi's mentality and thinking
 From that i have become very confident that their mentality and thinking is such that i lack the words to criticize them
 inke paas 10 saal tha desh ko rasaatal main le gai he
 Now when the country is standing up and rising with respect, the terrorists are being given a befitting reply, then they are in pain
 sawaal- manoj ji digvijay singh ne bhi kaha he baaki log hi sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki sena ko sailyut karne kii bajaae unako credit dene kii bajaay bijepi is maamle kaa credit le rahi he amit shah credit le rahe hai
 Manohar Parrikar is taking credit
 modi ko credit de rahe hai mudde ko politysijakiya ja rahaa he?manoj tiwari- aisa nahin he
 Credit is to the army, everyone is saluting the Indian Army and every person is paying salute to the security forces
 isamen pataa nahin unako kya dard ho rahaa he
 These too could have boosted the morale of our Indian Army, we do not know what is the reason for their pain, but the words which Rahul Gandhi has used are very few to be condemned and Rahul Gandhi should apologize on this
 bahut-se logon ko yah jaanakar aashcharya hoga ki aresas (rashtriya swayamsevak sangh) kii prarthana main 'hindu raashtra' kaa aahvaan maatr ek baar kiya jaataa he
 The prayer says, "vayam Hindu Rashtrang Bhuta: (we are all part of 'hindu Rashtra')
 '' aresas yah nahin kahata ki ham ek nayaa hindu raashtra banaaenge, na hi yah kahata he ki ham bharat ke samvidhan main sanshodhan karenge or is desh ko hindu raashtra ghoshit karenge
 Yet the Sangh's commitment to the Hindu nation leads to fear, resentment and surprise
 aresas kii ninda kii jaati he jabaki bahusankhyak log hindu raashtra ke 'nirmaan' kaa swaagat karte hai
 Ignorance or lack of clarity on both sides
 hindu raashtra ko lekar ashanka yaa bechaini ek agyaat dar se upajati he
 This unknown fear unites people and fills them with a false sense of pride and security
 vastav main sangh maanata he ki bharat ko hindu raashtra banane kii koi jarurat nahin kyonki vah pehle se hi hindu raashtra he
 It is important that 'hindu thought' is seen as 'nation idea', as is said about 'bharat idea'
 sampradayik, vibhaajankaree or asanvaidhanik bataakar hindu raashtra ke vichaar kaa uphaas or use khaarij kar dena utana hi galat he jitna ki 'bharat vichaar' ko ek bhramit gyaan bataakar khaarij kar dena
 In fact, upon closer analysis it becomes clear that there is no distinction between them
 aresas ne baar-baar bhartiya samvidhan ke prati apni nishtha or sankalp ko doharaaya he, jo sanyogvash lakeer kaa fakir nahin rahaa he; balki isamen samay-samay par sanshodhan kiye gaye hai
 Therefore, portraying the RSS as anti-constitutional is intellectually dishonest
 haalanki, aresas ek aisi saamaajik-rajnatik vyavastha kaa swaagat karegaa jo vartmaan sansthagat dhaanche kii tulana main bhartiya lokachar yaa 'bhartiyata' ko zyada sahi myne main parilakshith karti ho
 Therefore, it is necessary for the RSS to clear that doubt in everyone's mind and clarify that the idea of 'hindu Rashtra' is not a counter-argument to the idea of india today
 bharat kaa vichaar samaveshi he, to hindu raashtra kaa vichaar bhi aisa hi he; yah un sabhi vichaaron, pahachaanon or vichaaron kaa sangyojan karata he jise sammilit rup se hindu kaha jaataa he
 There are caste, class and linguistic divisions, but they are upper
 moulik hindu reeti se jivan ke saath to 'vividhta main ekta' kii sookhti bahut sateek baithti he
 For centuries, attacks by external robbers, colonial interrelationships and Hindu society's self-restrictive, naturalistic and existential involuntary responses severely affected the practice of some core principles of Hindu society, causing many evils
 haalanki, vividh pahchaan ek tarah se mul hindu manyata or 'jeevanstyli ke ang' rahe hai
 They may look different from above, causing them to doubt 'hindutva' and see it as a threat
 hindu raashtra ke samarthakon ko isi pahalu par kaam karne kii jarurat he or bajaae 'hamaara-banaam-unka' kathy taiyaar karne ke, unhen ek samaveshi or sakaaratmak kaarykram ke madhyam se apane drushtikon ko aage badhanaa chahie
 Hinduism, Hinduism and Hinduism have long been misinterpreted
 dharm shabd, jaisaa ki 'hindu dharm' main bhi judaa he, ko dharm kii pashchimi avadharana se nahin joda ja saktaa
 In fact, the word 'hinduism' itself is inappropriate
 vastav main, 'hindu' se abhipraay ek samaaj, vishisht saanskrithik or sabhyataa ke charitra vaale logon ke ek aise samooh se he jinaki kuch khaas manyataayen, paramparaayen, prathaen or haa, purvaagrah bhi hai
 In the Indian context, religion is the basis of the daily life of the society
 iskaa taatpary naitikta, mulyon or saamaajik prathaon se zyada he, na ki dharm se
 Whatever the discussions about religion, faith, secularism, nation, state, etc
 after independence, they actually took place without attempts to understand in the Indian context
 is tathy ko sweekaar kiya janaa chahie ki dharm kaa arth majahab nahin he or bhartiya sandarbh main dharmanirpekshata jaisi baat kaa koi auchity nahin he
 The terms Hindu and Rashtra are multidimensional and have historical antiquities
 rashtrawaad or uski visheshtaon ke vichaar ko swatantraaa sangram, uske vibhinn kisson or swatantraaa or vibhaajan main isaki parinti ke sandarbh main samajhaayaa janaa chahie
 'hindu nationalism' is an expression of a particular socio-political thought, based on indigenous cultural traditions and extensive spiritual experiences of the East
 kuch vidwaanon ne tark diya he ki 'hindu swadeshnurag' ke liye 'hindu rashtrawaad' shabd kaa upyog ekatarfa or bhraamak he
 In his view, 'hindu Rajya' would be a better word
 yah samaj aupniveshik prabhaav main viksit hui jisane is saanskrithik nirantarata ko tod diya, sabhyataagat laabhon ko nishprabhavi kar diya or hindutv tathaa rashtrawaad par iske prabhaav ke bare main agyanta or galatfahami paidaa kar di
 The idea of india as a society and nation was never religion based; It was a unique 'secularism' idea
 upasna ke vividh swaroopon main ativyapee, sah-astitv vaali manyataon ke jatil sakshya mil jate hai
 Contrary to Western and Semitic religious traditions, the complete command of one faith by one institution or the complete determination of all beliefs of a faith by a holy book is against the original Hindu concept
 isliye, bharat ko dharmanirpekshata yaa sah-astitv ke gunon ko seekhney, yaa fer nagarikon or gaiyr-nagarikon ke liye alag-alag niyam banane or unhen lagu karaane ke liye ek samvidhan kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Our attitude towards the world is guided by the core of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam
 isi parampara ko dhyaan main rakhkar 1950 ke bharat ke mul samvidhan main 'dharmanirpekshata' shabd kaa upyog karnaa aavashyak nahin samajha gaya
 During the Emergency in 1976, Indira Gandhi's government made the 42nd amendment
 isi ke madhyam se anya doorgaami parivartanon ke saath, samvidhan kii prastaavna main, 'dharmanirpeksh' shabd joda gaya—bharat ab keval ek 'samprabhu, loktantric ganraajya' nahin rahaa; ab yah ek 'samprabhu, samaajawaadee, dharmanirpeksh, loktantric ganraajya' ho gaya tha! lekin kya bharat 1947 or 1976 ke bich koi kam dharmanirpeksh tha, yaa ab ham adhik dharmanirpeksh hai kyonki samvidhan ab aisa kahata he?haalanki, dharmik alpsankhyakon ko mili sanvaidhanik guarantee, voton ke dhruvikaran ke liye rajnatik dalon ke haathon kaa ek khilonaa ban gai
 Poverty, unemployment, lack of opportunities and modern education and the biased attitude of elected governments deepen the fears and fears of the minorities about the majority
 vibhinn dharmik manyataon ke logon ke bich aapasi vishwaas ke bich jo khai paidaa hui he, use paatane ke liye gambhir prayaas kiye jane chahie
 The Union alone cannot build that bridge; It is everyone's responsibility
 ati satarkta or bheed dwaara hinsa, pathbhrashtataa or ghrunit aacharan kaa pratibimb hai or kuch nihit chhadam laabhon ke liye ise hindutv se nahin joda janaa chahie
 Undoubtedly, there is a definite political awakening among Hindus today
 vishesh rup se kamjor dalit or obisi kaa bada tabaka apane adhikaron or saamaajik-aarthik unnati kii aas main sattadhari dal ke peeche khadaa he
 Just as Muslims once became vote banks for the Congress, in the same way many backward classes of Hindus today see the possibility of shining their fortunes in the BJP
 lekin is tarah kaa koi bhi shashaktikaran yaa rajnatik vistaar vyarth jayega, agar yah keval peediton kii adla-badali tak simit rah jaae
 Surely an egalitarian society can be an ideal system
 sangh kaa ek hindu raashtra kaa 'srijan' keval aise vichaaron kii ek aisi pratyaashit subah he jiskaa aalingan, vividhta ke liye koi sankat khadaa nahin karata
 Seshadri Chari is the former editor of the English weekly Organizer and commentator on security and strategic affairs *** duniya bhar main mohabbat kii nishaani ke taur par mashhoor agra ke tajmahal kii khubsuurati kaa jawaab nahin
 The Taj Mahal is not only a sign of love, but it is also named among the seven wonders of the world
 is khubasurat or pyaar kii kahani bayaan karne vaali imaarat kaa har koi divaana he
 This is the reason why its beauty has dominated the hearts of people
 or ab to bollywood kii behtareen adaakara kaajol bhi tajmahal ke diwaanon ke fehrist main shaamil ho gai hai
 And if you too are crazy about the beauty of Taj Mahal, then you must definitely see this style of Kajol to tell the beauty of Taj Mahal
 apane pati ajay kii aane vaali film 'shivaay' ke liye yues main press tour ke dauraan kaajol ne sari pahani thi jisamen vah behad khubasurat najar aa rahi thim
 In this picture surfaced on Instagram, it is difficult to lose sight of Kajol's blouse
 kaajol ke simple blike blouse par tajmahal kii ambroidari kii gai thi
 The Taj Mahal, embroidered with golden thread, really looks as beautiful on this Kajol dress as it actually is
 vaise, kaajol ke blouse kii is ambroidari ko dekhakar ek baar phir aap jarur kah uthenge, vaah taj!
 While you may have seen many scenes and scenes in the Taj Mahal in many songs and songs, the artistry on the Taj Mahal's blouse in this way is truly unique and capable

 SY Qureshi has given a big statement in this case
 unhone kaha, 'piem modi ke helicopter kii jaanch karne walvefasar kaa nilamban durbhagyapurna to he hi, saath hi piem or chunaav ayog ne apni chhavi ko sudhaarney kaa ek mauka bhi ganvaa diya'
 Qureshi further said, "both these institutions have accountability to the public, but Prime Minister Modi is continuously violating the code of conduct and the Election Commission is ignoring it repeatedly
 piem ke helicopter kii jaanch ko is tareeke se liya janaa chahie tha ki kanoon sabake liye baraabar he, lekin aisa nahin hua'

 SY Quraishi further referred to the search of Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik's helicopter and said, 'the patience and gentleness he showed is worthwhile

 On the other hand, BSP supremo Mayawati also gave Dr
 esavai kuraishi kii baton ke samarthan main twit kar chunaav ayog ko nishane par liya
 Questioning the commission, Mayawati said, "what authority does the Election Commission have which prevents the search of pm's aircraft and IAS supervisor is suspended for doing so
" bispi purv siisi kuraishi kii baton sesahamat he ki aisi karrwai anuchit he
 The Commission should do a fair work and not PM Modi get all kinds of open leeway '

 The BSP agrees with former CEC Mr
 Qureshi that such action is unfair

 jila colector or police mahanideshak kii report ke aadhaar par ayog ne sambalpur ke general paryvekshak ko ghatana ke ek din baad nilambit kar diya gaya
 The incident happened on Tuesday
 ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki sambalpur main pradhanmantri ke helicopter kii jaanch karnaa nirvachan ayog ke disha-nirdeshon ke tahat nahin tha

 We and you really do not know how much ability is there to take examinations in institutions made for government recruitment in all the states including Rajasthan, Bihar, Punjab, Delhi, Bengal and Madhya Pradesh
 kyon ek bhi pariksha thik se nahin ho paati he
 Why there is repeated theft, something happens that the exam is canceled
 kya 21veen sadi ke bharat main ham ek eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha kii maang nahin kar sakate
 In this also, a business is flourishing within
 pariksha karne vaali sanstha to sarkari hoti hai, magar pariksha karaane ke liye kisi privet company ko theka de diya jaataa he
 Today, students from engineering colleges of Bihar came to meet me

 Whatever India you know through TV or your experience is incomplete India
 uski samaj vaaki adhuri he
 Can you give an example of any country in the world where the form of an examination has come out in 2010 and that examination has not been completed by 2018
 yah march 5 farvari kii he, patna ke gardanibagh se ashiana mode ke bich ek march nikaala gaya jiskaa naam aakrosh march he
 There is resentment in the name itself; the rest of March is being depressed in February
 inke march se na to shahar ko fark padaa, na sarkaar ko
 The duty of raising voice, but democracy would not have been made proud by the rituals
 ninsafiyon ke maaron kaa apana ek alag mulk hota he, is mulk ko har rajya se hataa kar kisi kone main thel diya gaya he jaise dilli ke jantar mantar par log jamaa hote the ab vahaan jamaa nahin ho sakate
 Similarly, in Patna, now the strike has been settled in Gurdnibagh
 yah dharna bihar rajya polytechnic chaatr sangh ke tatvadhan main yojit he
 You know that there are 32 Government Polytechnic Colleges in Bihar, there are as many private Polytechnic Colleges, 9600 youths come out from here every year

 So that you do not say that they did not use democratic methods

 You may not have even heard such a slogan in Che Gwara's revolution
 'nahar baandh todane kaa mat lagaao chuhon par ilzaam, behaal karo kaneey abhiyantaa, lekar likhit igzaam
 In the slogan of 'modi Modi' we forgot that the creativity of slogans in India is still left
 in naujavaanon ne hamen apane pradarshnon kii ek list bhi dikhaai jisamen ankrosh march, putala dahan, aamaran anshan, aam sabha, kalege talabandi, mashaal march, vidhansabha gheraav kaa zikr he
 There is also self-immolation, which should not happen
 65 din main inase baatcheet ke liye koi nahin aayaa
 Now read this timeline carefully
 bharat main ek pariksha laapata ho gai he
 The students taking the exams are on strike, but there is no trace of the exam
 naujavaanon ko barbaad karne kaa bermuda trikon bana hua he jisamen na jane kitni javaaniyaan hameshaa hameshaa ke liye gaayab ho gai hai
 On 7 January 2010, the Bihar Government asked the Bihar Staff Selection Commission to start the process of recruiting 2030 junior engineers
 dedh saal baad 8 june 2011 ko bhartee kaa vigyaapan nikalataa he ki likhit pariksha ke ank par merit list se bahaali hogi
 After 15 months, on 30 September 2012, the examination is done at various centers in Patna city
 sochie janvari 2010 main bihar rajya ko 2030 junior ejeeniyar kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos hoti he, 30 sitambar 2012 tak sirf pariksha hi hoti he
 We do not have any social audit on how the delayed recruitment affected the progress of the state, how the youth were wasted
 vigyaapan nikalne ke dhai saal baad likhit pariksha vivaadon main funs jaati he
 840 candidates are caught stealing the answer book by stealing
 maamla court main pahunchataa he or hai court kaa aadesh aata he ki cese chalata rahegaa, pehle bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog riselt nikaale
 When the results are out on 7 May 2014, 840 candidates also appear in the merit list of those who were caught stealing and against whom the police have filed a case
 phir maamla hoi court main pahunchataa he
 Now from here i make my story a little shorter
 apane hi nagarikon ko thag kar bharat ko vishwa guru banane kaa ek project chalaaya ja rahaa he jo apane aap main thagi kaa megaproject he
 The case goes on, the investigation takes place and in June 2016 the High Court quits the entire result
 2010 se 2016 aa gaya
 In the hope of being elected a 2030 Junior Engineer, six years of life of the youth ends
 phir isi kii pariksha kii taarikh nikalati he
 It is decided that on August 7, 2016, the examination will be done at many centers in Bhojpur
 4 agast 2016 ko notice aata he ki 7 agast ko pariksha nahin hogi
 Now the new date comes out that the exam will be on 18 September 2016
 pehali paali main duusari paali ke or duusari paali main pehali paali ke prashn patr baante jate hai
 When all the questions were reversed, there was an uproar, the matter then reached the High Court
 2 farvari 2017 ko patna hoicourt kaa aadesh aata he ki nae sire se pariksha hogi
 Where have we been since January 2010, 2 February 2017
 abhi tak 2030 junior ejeeniyar kii ek pariksha tak yojit nahin ho saki he
 As of 31 January 2018, there is no sign of this examination
 ab nayaa aadesh aayaa he ki agali pariksha farvari 2018 yaa march ke pratham saptaah main hogi
 Don't you think we should discuss these issues
 in sab sawaalon ke bagair kisi bhi vyavastha kii hamaari samaj kitni adhuri or khokhli he
 In the 13 series i have gained some experience
 daawey ke saath to nahin kah saktaa magar har rajya main isi tarah kaa pattern dekh rahaa hum
 The exam is unsuccessful due to the selection commission i
e
 the system of government, the ruined youth are there
 aisi khabaren aam taur par akhbaaron main kisi kone main chhap di jaati hai
 i cannot comment on the political understanding of these youth because i do not know
 par ges kar saktaa hum ki kahin ye bhi hindu muslim yaa jati ke khaanche main bante hote honge
 Otherwise, in a state where there are not enough teachers in engineering colleges, uneducated boys pass, 10,000 junior engineers pass every year, the political quality of its youth is very poor
 agar karaab na hoti to kisi ke liye aasaan nahin hota in muddon ko nazarandaaz kar dena
 The Polytechnic College of Bihar is devoid of teachers
 teacher nahin hai
 Then why do these colleges go on? teen saal lagaakar polytechnic karaane kaa kya matlab he
 Why is the entrance test taken for this
 dhai lakh chaatr farm bharte hai or 9000 ke kareeb seat he
 The people of Bihar are not honest with their own youth, nor are the youth honest to themselves
 kya kaha jaae, vahi baat he ki naujavaanon kii polytical quality unki degree se bhi badtar he
 By writing this, the youth should hang it in their room that i have said
 dilli vishvavidhyalay shikshak sangh duuta ne 6 farvari ko bada march nikaala
 Reached in large numbers, these teachers are demanding regularization of teachers teaching Adhak and Temperary
 yah bhi ki niyuktiyon main paardarshita honi chahie jo nahin ho rahi he
 These teachers are questioning the appointments made in the Faculty of Law and the Department of Education
 inkaa kahana he ki niyukti ke liye ujisi ne jo formula banaaya he use chhodkar sab kuch chayan samiti kii marji par chhod diya gaya he
 He says that the Faculty of Law was interviewed for 126 posts in July August 2017
 rigelt abhi aayaa nahin he magar lipapha khulne se pehle hi vishvavidhyalay main 27 janvari se chune gaye lekturer professor kii suchi ghoomane lagi
 More than half of the 84 Adahaka teachers already teaching in this list were excluded
 isi ke khilaaf duuta ne bada morcha nikaala ki jo log ausatan 5 saal or adhiktam 15 saal se edaha padhaa rahe hai un sabko permanent naukari par rakhaa janaa chahie
 a large number of Permanent teachers have supported the Adhaka teachers
 sabaki zindagi daanv par lagi he
 We did the university series, no one seemed to mind
 sabko hindu muslim par itnaa bharosa ho gaya he ki ab naagarik kii koi haisiyat hi nahin bachi he
 This story is painful
 dilli vishvavidhyalay main hazaron kii sankhya main edaha shikshak kai saal se edaha padhaa rahe hai
 a lecturer in the Faculty of LA, who has been teaching Adhaq for eight years, said that he gave 15 interviews in eight years
 15 baar unhen faikalti of laa ne padhaane ke liye rakhaa lekin jab permanent rakhane kii baari ai to unhen baahar kar diya gaya
 The transparent process of reinstatement of teachers was not there before or it is now
 na kabhi hogi, ye bhi likhakar de saktaa hum
 Restorations are taking place according to political recommendations
 ise aap nahin badal sakate hai, haa pratibha or paardarshita par lacture de sakate hai
 Think 84 were teaching Isaac 44 out of them
 chaatro par kitna sadma pahunchataa hoga jab ve apane achche shikshak ko yun baahar jate dekhte honge
 The University of Delhi only seems to shine in June and July when the middle class is cheated by the newspapers that this is the best university in India for children who bring more than 95 percent
 edaha shikshakon kii kahani bataa rahi he ki ham sab ek azaad mulk main system kii kisi kisi ghulaami kar rahe hai
 i am now beginning to understand why such issues come up on TV or in the media everyday, which are not issues at all
 in shikshakon ke saath jo ninsaphi ho rahi he uskaa samaadhaan mujhe nazar nahin aata
 Universities are doomed
 kahin bhi yogya shikshakon ke liye jagah nahin bachi he
 Think, what college is waiting for the children for whom you pay millions in the name of a good school, what you don't bear, when they get out of school
 kabhi is par bhi bahes kar lijie, samaaj ne teen maheene tak ek film par charchaa kii he, aapako pataa nahin ki apane bacchon ke bhavishya ke saath kya ninsaphi kii he sabane
 Now we will talk about recruited 1218 posts of Forest Guard of Uttarakhand

 The first excuse given that the qualification for the Forest Guard has been expanded
 krishi vigyaan ke alaava arts kamrs ke chaatr bhi is pariksha main baith sakenge
 The age limit for the guard was increased from 24 years to 42 years
 sidhaa dabl
 The maximum age in railways has been reduced from 30 years to 28 years and here it has been increased from 24 years to 42 years
 yah chamatkaar sirf or sirf isliye ho saktaa he ki is desh main vahi vaala taapic hi chalegaa or chalata he
 Mansera said that students have spent 30-30 thousand rupees on its coaching
 yahi nahin, uttarakhand van vikaas nigam ke 191 padon ke liye 31 disambar 2016 ko aavedan aae
 Thousands of students filled the form by giving 500 rupees
 paper li ho gaya abhi tak paper nahin hua he

 The students taking the exams are on strike, but there is no trace of the exam
 naujavaanon ko barbaad karne kaa bermuda trikon bana hua he jisamen na jane kitni javaaniyaan hameshaa hameshaa ke liye gaayab ho gai hai
 On 7 January 2010, the Bihar Government asked the Bihar Staff Selection Commission to start the process of recruiting 2030 junior engineers
 dedh saal baad 8 june 2011 ko bhartee kaa vigyaapan nikalataa he ki likhit pariksha ke ank par merit list se bahaali hogi
 After 15 months, on 30 September 2012, the examination is done at various centers in Patna city
 sochie janvari 2010 main bihar rajya ko 2030 junior ejeeniyar kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos hoti he, 30 sitambar 2012 tak sirf pariksha hi hoti he
 We do not have any social audit on how the delayed recruitment affected the progress of the state, how the youth were wasted
 vigyaapan nikalne ke dhai saal baad likhit pariksha vivaadon main funs jaati he
 840 candidates are caught stealing the answer book by stealing
 maamla court main pahunchataa he or hai court kaa aadesh aata he ki cese chalata rahegaa, pehle bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog riselt nikaale
 When the results are out on 7 May 2014, 840 candidates also appear in the merit list of those who were caught stealing and against whom the police have filed a case
 phir maamla hoi court main pahunchataa he
 Now from here i make my story a little shorter
 apane hi nagarikon ko thag kar bharat ko vishwa guru banane kaa ek project chalaaya ja rahaa he jo apane aap main thagi kaa megaproject he
 The case goes on, the investigation takes place and in June 2016 the High Court quits the entire result
 2010 se 2016 aa gaya
 In the hope of being elected a 2030 Junior Engineer, six years of life of the youth ends
 phir isi kii pariksha kii taarikh nikalati he
 It is decided that on August 7, 2016, the examination will be done at many centers in Bhojpur
 4 agast 2016 ko notice aata he ki 7 agast ko pariksha nahin hogi
 Now the new date comes out that the exam will be on 18 September 2016
 pehali paali main duusari paali ke or duusari paali main pehali paali ke prashn patr baante jate hai
 When all the questions were reversed, there was an uproar, the matter then reached the High Court
 2 farvari 2017 ko patna hoicourt kaa aadesh aata he ki nae sire se pariksha hogi
 Where have we been since January 2010, 2 February 2017
 abhi tak 2030 junior ejeeniyar kii ek pariksha tak yojit nahin ho saki he
 As of 31 January 2018, there is no sign of this examination
 ab nayaa aadesh aayaa he ki agali pariksha farvari 2018 yaa march ke pratham saptaah main hogi
 Don't you think we should discuss these issues
 in sab sawaalon ke bagair kisi bhi vyavastha kii hamaari samaj kitni adhuri or khokhli he
 In the 13 series i have gained some experience
 daawey ke saath to nahin kah saktaa magar har rajya main isi tarah kaa pattern dekh rahaa hum
 The exam is unsuccessful due to the selection commission i
e
 the system of government, the ruined youth are there
 aisi khabaren aam taur par akhbaaron main kisi kone main chhap di jaati hai
 i cannot comment on the political understanding of these youth because i do not know
 par ges kar saktaa hum ki kahin ye bhi hindu muslim yaa jati ke khaanche main bante hote honge
 Otherwise, in a state where there are not enough teachers in engineering colleges, uneducated boys pass, 10,000 junior engineers pass every year, the political quality of its youth is very poor
 agar karaab na hoti to kisi ke liye aasaan nahin hota in muddon ko nazarandaaz kar dena
 The Polytechnic College of Bihar is devoid of teachers
 teacher nahin hai
 Then why do these colleges go on? teen saal lagaakar polytechnic karaane kaa kya matlab he
 Why is the entrance test taken for this
 dhai lakh chaatr farm bharte hai or 9000 ke kareeb seat he
 The people of Bihar are not honest with their own youth, nor are the youth honest to themselves
 kya kaha jaae, vahi baat he ki naujavaanon kii polytical quality unki degree se bhi badtar he
 By writing this, the youth should hang it in their room that i have said
 dilli vishvavidhyalay shikshak sangh duuta ne 6 farvari ko bada march nikaala
 Reached in large numbers, these teachers are demanding regularization of teachers teaching Adhak and Temperary
 yah bhi ki niyuktiyon main paardarshita honi chahie jo nahin ho rahi he
 These teachers are questioning the appointments made in the Faculty of Law and the Department of Education
 inkaa kahana he ki niyukti ke liye ujisi ne jo formula banaaya he use chhodkar sab kuch chayan samiti kii marji par chhod diya gaya he
 He says that the Faculty of Law was interviewed for 126 posts in July August 2017
 rigelt abhi aayaa nahin he magar lipapha khulne se pehle hi vishvavidhyalay main 27 janvari se chune gaye lekturer professor kii suchi ghoomane lagi
 More than half of the 84 Adahaka teachers already teaching in this list were excluded
 isi ke khilaaf duuta ne bada morcha nikaala ki jo log ausatan 5 saal or adhiktam 15 saal se edaha padhaa rahe hai un sabko permanent naukari par rakhaa janaa chahie
 a large number of Permanent teachers have supported the Adhaka teachers
 sabaki zindagi daanv par lagi he
 We did the university series, no one seemed to mind
 sabko hindu muslim par itnaa bharosa ho gaya he ki ab naagarik kii koi haisiyat hi nahin bachi he
 This story is painful
 dilli vishvavidhyalay main hazaron kii sankhya main edaha shikshak kai saal se edaha padhaa rahe hai
 a lecturer in the Faculty of LA, who has been teaching Adhaq for eight years, said that he gave 15 interviews in eight years
 15 baar unhen faikalti of laa ne padhaane ke liye rakhaa lekin jab permanent rakhane kii baari ai to unhen baahar kar diya gaya
 The transparent process of reinstatement of teachers was not there before or it is now
 na kabhi hogi, ye bhi likhakar de saktaa hum
 Restorations are taking place according to political recommendations
 ise aap nahin badal sakate hai, haa pratibha or paardarshita par lacture de sakate hai
 Think 84 were teaching Isaac 44 out of them
 chaatro par kitna sadma pahunchataa hoga jab ve apane achche shikshak ko yun baahar jate dekhte honge
 The University of Delhi only seems to shine in June and July when the middle class is cheated by the newspapers that this is the best university in India for children who bring more than 95 percent
 edaha shikshakon kii kahani bataa rahi he ki ham sab ek azaad mulk main system kii kisi kisi ghulaami kar rahe hai
 i am now beginning to understand why such issues come up on TV or in the media everyday, which are not issues at all
 in shikshakon ke saath jo ninsaphi ho rahi he uskaa samaadhaan mujhe nazar nahin aata
 Universities are doomed
 kahin bhi yogya shikshakon ke liye jagah nahin bachi he
 Think, what college is waiting for the children for whom you pay millions in the name of a good school, what you don't bear, when they get out of school
 kabhi is par bhi bahes kar lijie, samaaj ne teen maheene tak ek film par charchaa kii he, aapako pataa nahin ki apane bacchon ke bhavishya ke saath kya ninsaphi kii he sabane
 Now we will talk about recruited 1218 posts of Forest Guard of Uttarakhand
 dinesh mansera ne bataaya he ki 23 sitambar 2017 ko 25,000 se zyaada aavedan aate hai
 300 rupees are charged from the students for this
 ab sarkaar ne is bhartee par roak laga di he
 The first excuse given that the qualification for the Forest Guard has been expanded
 krishi vigyaan ke alaava arts kamrs ke chaatr bhi is pariksha main baith sakenge
 The age limit for the guard was increased from 24 years to 42 years
 sidhaa dabl
 The maximum age in railways has been reduced from 30 years to 28 years and here it has been increased from 24 years to 42 years
 yah chamatkaar sirf or sirf isliye ho saktaa he ki is desh main vahi vaala taapic hi chalegaa or chalata he
 Mansera said that students have spent 30-30 thousand rupees on its coaching
 yahi nahin, uttarakhand van vikaas nigam ke 191 padon ke liye 31 disambar 2016 ko aavedan aae
 Thousands of students filled the form by giving 500 rupees
 paper li ho gaya abhi tak paper nahin hua he
 2016 to 2018 has arrived
 dinesh mansera kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ke paas vetan dene ke liye paise kii tangi he
 Recently took a loan of 500 crores for giving salary
 dinesh ne rajya ke vitt aabkaari mantri prakaash pant se baat kii
 Have told the youth of Bengal that be patient, their number will come
 agar aapako lagata he ki sirf zikr kar dene se aapkaa kaam ho jayega to aapaki samaj na to system kii he na hi loktantr kii na hi aapke naagarik kartavyon kii
 i understand you youngsters are still raw
 aap is vakt besahaara maare maare phir rahe hai
 Students of West Bengal reached the West Bengal Service Commission on Tuesday to find out how long their stuck results would continue to be stuck
 haal hi main west bengal sarvice kamishan ko best bengal public sarvice kamishan main mila diya gaya he
 Some videos and pictures have been sent by the students

 The result of the Upper Primary Teacher Recruitment Exam came in September 2016 but we are still waiting for the interview
 khaastaur par eldisi / ld or capies pariksha jo west bengal staff sellection kamishan ne 2015 main liya tha
 Now the government of West Bengal has dissolved the selection commission
 is pariksha ke duusare bhaag ke rigelt kaa ab tak intjaar kiya ja rahaa he
 All examinations will now be conducted by the West Bengal Public Service Commission, whose work is very slow
 hamaare yahaan to vaarshik calendar tak nahin he
 Many minor restorations such as those in the panchayat office are taking place in the Zilla Parishad office but there is more corruption and delay
 koi bhi media hamaari haalat or jarurat ko nahin dikhaata
 Therefore, you are requested to look at the data of jobs here and show the news on it
 tippaniyan Thank you pashchim bengal ke asahaay naukari khoji See India through our job series
 uski vyavastha ko dekhie
 You will know what is reality and what is slogan
 aap railway kii pariksha kii taiyaari karne vaale naujavaanon ke ghar ja kar dekhie, sirf adhiktam umr 30 se ghataakar 28 kar dene se kitne naujavaanon ke chehre par udaasi he
 Three to four years of his preparation has flown into the air
 aap upi ke un javaanon se miliye jinhone police seva main lipic, computer seva ke liye naukari aane kaa intazaar kar rahe the magar police bhartee or pronnati board ne imtahaan hi radd kar diya
 Regardless of the happy pictures we show on the channels, the reality is that the youth are depressed
 bhale hi unke paas pakora talane ke alaava koi rasta nahin bachaa he
 The taste of fried pakoras with sad hands will fade
 kabhi namak zyaada ho jayega kabhi tel to kabhi tikhaapan
 You may feel that i am doing a job series in a joke, but after picking up all the episodes, read one line and you will see the cruel face of the system
 naujavaanon ne bataaya ki 6 farvari 2018 ko inhone bihar ke up mukhyamantri susheel modi ke ghar kaa gheraav kiya
 The effigy of Road Construction Department Minister Nand Kishore Yadav was burnt
 is naare ko dekhie
 You may not have even heard such a slogan in Che Gwara's revolution
 'nahar baandh todane kaa mat lagaao chuhon par ilzaam, behaal karo kaneey abhiyantaa, lekar likhit igzaam
 In the slogan of 'modi Modi' we forgot that the creativity of slogans in India is still left
 in naujavaanon ne hamen apane pradarshnon kii ek list bhi dikhaai jisamen ankrosh march, putala dahan, aamaran anshan, aam sabha, kalege talabandi, mashaal march, vidhansabha gheraav kaa zikr he
