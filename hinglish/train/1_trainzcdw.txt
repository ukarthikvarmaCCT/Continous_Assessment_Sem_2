chunaav ayog ne apane ayukta ashok lavasa ke asahmati note (dissent note) ko saarvajanik karne se spasht rup se inkaar kar diya he
 The Commission has refused to give this information sought under the Right to Information Act
 chunaav ayukta ashok lavasa ke ye asahmati note pradhanmantri narendra modi ke chunavi bhaashanon se jude hai
 During the Lok Sabha elections, some of Modi's speeches were alleged to have violated the model code of conduct
 chunaav ayog ne kaha ki use aisi koi bhi soochna na dene kii chhot mili he jisase kisi vyakti ke jaan yaa shaareerik suraksha par khatra paidaa ho saktaa he
 Pune's RTI activist Vihar Dhurve had demanded a dissenting note of Ashok Lavasa from the Election Commission
 chunaav ayog ne is maang ko asweekaar kar diya he
 Let us know that during the Lok Sabha elections, many speeches of PM Narendra Modi were accused of violating the code of conduct
 piem modi ne ye bhaashan 1 april ko wardha main, 9 april ko latur main, 21 april ko patan or barmer main or 25 april ko varanasi main die the
 Though the Election Commission gave a clean chit on allegations of violation of the code of conduct on PM Modi, Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa disagreed on these decisions
 teen sadasyon vaale chunaav ayog main mukhya chunaav ayukta kii jimmedaari sunil aroda ke paas he jabaki do anya ayukta ashok lavasa va susheel chandra hai
 The Election Commission, citing Section 8 (1) (g) of the RTI Act, said that such information cannot be made public that endangers the life or physical safety of a person, or identifies the source of information Or the assistance given for law-enforcement or security purposes may be endangered
 dhurve ne chunaav ayog dwaara piem ko clin chit die jane ke liye apanaai gai prakriya or ayog dwaara die gaye faislon kii jaankaree bhi maangi thi
 The Election Commission also refused to give these information
 mana jaataa he ki piem modi or amit shah ko baar-baar clin chit die jane par ashok lavasa ne aapatti jataai thi
 When the Election Commission did not include Ashok Lavasa's dissent note in its order, Ashok Lavasa distanced himself from cases of code of conduct violation
 iske baad chunaav ayog ne kaha tha ki asahmati note or alpamat vichaar record kaa hissaa to rahenge, lekin inhen saarvajanik nahin kiya jayega

 ek major ne duusare major kii patni kaa dilli kii sadak par saream katl kar diya ye khabar to aap sabko pataa he
 But what was the reason that caused Major Nikhil to kill Shailaja? Did this murder happen in the face of sudden anger or did the Major leave the house with the intention of killing? So let's answer all these questions as well as why Major Nikhil killed Shailaja
 major nikhil ne shailaja kaa qatl kyon kiya? kya shailaja nikhil se peechha chhudaana chaahati thi isliye? yaa nikhil shailaja se peechha chhudaana chahta tha isliye? 23 june kii dopaher ko nikhil or shailaja main jhagada kyon hua? kya nikhil ne qatl kii planning pehle se kar rakhi thi? shailaja se milane nikhil do chaaku lekar kyon aayaa tha? kya 23 june ko donon kii mulaaqaat pehle se tay thi? akhir nikhil or shailaja ke rishte kaa sach kya he?kehete hai ki kisi bhi qatl ke peeche koi naa koi makasad zarur hota he
 Once the motive is revealed, then the case is easily solved
 is cese main kaatil or makatool donon saamne hai
 But the problem is that the motive for killing Shailaja is not one but two
 yahi vajah he ki cese aaine kii tarah saaf hote hue bhi police shailaja ke katl ke makasad ko lekar daawey se abhi kuch nahin kah rahi he
 To understand the motive of Shailaja's murder, it is necessary to understand some things related to the case
 police se poochtacha ke dauraan major nikhil baar-baar yahi kah rahaa he ki shailaja se uski dosti teen saal pehle 2015 main fasebuk ke jariye hui thi
 Then Shailaja told that her husband works in a bank
 iske baad dimapur main posting ke dauraan vahiin shailaja se uski mulaakaat hui or phir dosti
 While Shailaja's husband Major Amit says that he has known Major Nikhil for only six months
 yani shailaja ne dhai saal tak amit se nikhil kaa sach chhupaae rakhaa? shailaja ne nikhil se dosti kii baat amit ko nahin bataai
 But why? Major Amit and Shailaja's housemates are constantly saying that Nikhil followed and harassed Shailaja
 iske alaava donon ke bich koi rishta nahin tha
 While in the police interrogation, Major Nikhil is constantly saying that he was not behind Shailaja but Shailaja was behind him
 wo usase shaadi karnaa chaahati thi
 However, the police say that this could also be Nikhil's drama
 kyonki shailaja ab is duniya main nahin he, lihaaza nikhil ke daawey kii tasadeeq ho nahin sakati
 It can also be Nikhil's attempt to protect himself by putting all the blame on Shailaja
 lekin police sutron ke mutabik itnaa saaf he ki major nikhil or shailaja phone or whatsap par ek duusare ke sampark main rahaa karte the
 In the last seven months, the police said that Shailaja and Nikhil had 3300 calls and 1500 messages to each other
 to phir achaanak aisa kya hua ki nikhil ne shailaja kii jaan le lee
 According to police sources, the twist in the story came in December last year
 jab major amit kaa tabadalaa dilli ho gaya or wo shailaja ke saath dimapur se dilli aa gaye
 After coming to Delhi, Shailja moved to Amritsar
 shailaja kaa parivaar amritsar main hi rahata he
 Meanwhile, Major Nikhil also came to Delhi from Dimapur on June 4 as an excuse for illness
 nikhil ke bivi bachche dilli ke saket ilaake main hi rahete hai
 After coming to Delhi, Nikhil went to meet Shailaja twice in June
 poochtacha main nikhil ne police ko bataaya ki duusari baar amritsar ke ek mal main mulaakaat ke dauraan shailaja se shaadi ko lekar uskaa phir se jhagada hua tha or tabhi pehali baar shailaja ke katl kii baat uske dimag main ai thi
 On the morning of June 23, Nikhil and Shailaja also spoke on whatsapp and the two decided to meet at the Army's base hospital
 hospital se donon saath main nikhil kii car main nikle or phir kareeb 45 minute tak donon car main rahe
 During this, both were constantly fighting
 police sutron kii maane to nikhil pehle se thaan kar aayaa tha ki agar shailaja apni baat par adi rahi to wo use maar degaa
 And he did the same thing
 nikhil ne saath laae chaaku se shailaja ke gale par pehle waar kiya or phir shailaja ko car se baahar phenkakar apni car se use raundte hue vahaan se nikal bhaaga
 In this way, this love story ended by going to a murder

 kal yani 1 disambar ko mukesh ambani ne jeeyo ke welcome ofer kii avadhi badhaane ke saath ek or elaan kiya he
 He said that the company will install Aadhaar card based micro ATM through which people will be able to withdraw money
 iske liye company marchents ke saath qaraar karegi or unhen jeeyo mani kii sarvice degi
 What micro ATM and how it can prove beneficial for you
 waisi jagah jahaan atm kii uplabdhta nahin he vahaan bank ke karmchaaree point of cell mashin lekar micro atm sarvice dete hai
 Although not much cash can be given through this, but in present times it is a solution to many problems
 micro atm ke jariye ye kaam kiye ja sakate hai- e-kyc besd seaving acount khole ja sakate hai
 - Cash can be deposited
 - cash nikaale ja sakate hai
 - Funds can also be transferred
 - acount balance ke bare main jaankaree bhi le sakate hai
 In this way, while shopping at Micro ATM Mall, you must have seen a card swiping machine near the merchant, which is called Point of Sale
 micro atm bhi vaise hi hote hai
 The bank employees sit at one place where you have to show your Aadhaar card
 yahaan biometric othentication ke liye aapkafingerprint scan kiya jaataa he
 On receipt of the successful authentication, a receipt is given and the employee pays you
 tranjaction hone ke baad aapke mobile number par isaki jaankaree milti he
 Apart from fingerprint, if you have a debit card, you can also swipe it and do the transaction
 haalanki yah depend karata he ki wo point of cell mashin kis bank kii he
 Different banks do it in their own way
 bank acount open karne ke liye bhi aapako apni jaankaree ke saath fingerprint dena hota he
 The information related to Aadhaar gets itself into this machine
 maujuuda daur main koshish yah ho rahi he ki banking main fingerprint kaa zyada se zyada yuj ho
 Under this, deposits can be made from cash deposit to withdrawal
 jeeyo micro atm ke bare main baat karte hue reliance industries limited ke chairman mukesh ambani ne kaha, 'customers apane bank acount se link kiye gaye jeeyo mani wolet se pement karenge or marchent jeeyo mani marchent ap ke jariye unhen accept karenge
 The money will go directly to the merchant's bank account '
 aane vaale dinon main aisa sambhav he ki desh main atm se zyada reliance jeeyo ke micro atm honge, kyonki company ne pehle se hi atm kii sankhya jitna e-kyc store khol liye hai

 At the same time, a room has been allotted in the party headquarters and a name plate has also been installed in it

 It will start from Lucknow

 iske alaava ve lakhanu main road sho karke 2019 lok sabha chunaav kaa aagaaj karengi

 aapako bataa den ki pehle priyanka gandhi ko 10 farvari ko lakhanu janaa tha lekin ab 11 farvari kaa kaarykramatay kiya gaya he
 It is worth noting that Priyanka Gandhi has been appointed the general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh
 aapako bataa den ki sapa or bispi ne congress ko abhi apane sanghathan main shaamil nahin kiya he
 After this, the Congress, regardless of this, contested alone in all 80 seats of Uttar Pradesh
 itnaa hi nahin congress ne priyanka gandhi (priyanka Gandhi) wadra ko bhi raajnneeti main utaar diya
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress had got only 2 seats and the total vote percentage was less than 8
 aise main dekhne vaali baat yah hogi ki purvanchal main priyanka gandhi wadra kaa jaadu kitna chal paata he

 aaj ham hindustani main baat karenchif justise of india pehle bhi jajon kii niyukti ke mudde ko piem modi ke saamne uthaa chuke hai
 In the beginning of his speech he said that all my dear friends who spoke before me, all of them spoke in English

 aazaadee ke wo sipaahi jinhone qurbaani di, jail kii yatnaayen sahin, unako yaad karne kaa din hai
 Do not forget the sacrifice

 bahut qurbaani di
 65,71, sacrificed in the war of Kargil
 aaj bhi jahaan ugravad he, vahaan bhi hamaare faujee, paramiletry ke jawan lage hue hai, unhen bhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie
 Chief Justice on Poverty and Unemployment In 1947 we had a population of 32 crores
 10 karod log tab bhi garibi rekha ke neeche the
 About a third of the people were below the poverty line
 aaj hamaari aabaadi 125 karod ho chuki hai
 The population of the same 10 crores has gone to 40 crores
 jaraa un par bhi dhyaan dijie, lekin aapane garibi rekha bhi aise dra kii he ki 26 rupee gaanv main or 32 rupee shahar main kamaane vaala shaks garibi rekha se upar chalaa jaataa he
 a big challenge is whether we have been able to remove poverty after 70 years
 aaj rojgaar kii pareshaani he
 Today, if i give vacancy for a peon in the Supreme Court, then post graduates also apply
 ab kehane main koi hichak nahin: cjisijeai ne kaha ki main court ke baahar bhi or court ke andar bhi badi bebaaki se bolta hum, kyonki mujhe lagata hai ki meri jindagi kaa jo sabase ooncha str hai, main vahaan panhucha hum
 Beyond this i do not go anywhere, so i do not have any problem nor have any hesitation
 sahi baat aapke dil ko chhuegi or yahi meri takat bhi hai

 Arranged for hospital immediately - on way to meet bereaved family! Senior Sena leader Manohar Joshi claimed that Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar had agreed to an alliance with the Shiv Sena in the last assembly elections in Maharashtra
 lekin baad main kinhin kaarnon se pavaar peeche hat gaye
 Joshi said that he does not remember who took the initiative in the case
 loksabhaa ke purv adhyaksh joshi ne kaha, 'saal 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaav main pavaar ne shivasena ke saath gathbandhan karne kii ichha jaahir kii thi
 Asked who had taken the initiative regarding the alliance, Joshi said that he is unable to remember it at the moment
 unhone kaha, 'mujhase uddhavji ne pavaar ke saath baatcheet karne ke liye kaha tha or maine kiya
 The former chief minister said that Pawar later backed out of the alliance and he did not know why it happened
 duusari ore, shivasena ne joshi ke is daawey ko khaarij kiya he
 Senior Shiv Sena leader Subhash Desai told reporters that Uddhav had not even thought about it
 unhone kaha, 'mudda purana he or uddhav thakare ne is taraf sochaa bhi nahin tha
 Asked if such an alliance is possible in the future, Desai said, "only Joshi can make predictions about the future
 main is bare main baat kaise karuunga
 On Joshi's claim that "joshi wants to make a place in the party", NCP spokesman Nawab Malik said that there is no place for Joshi in Shiv Sena
 us party ne unhen rajyasabha or loksabhaa kaa tikat dene se manaa kar diya
 Malik said, 'he is trying to make a place for himself in the party by talking such nonsense
 'gauratlab he ki joshi ke khulaase se pehle shivasena-bijepi ke varisht netaaon uddhav thakare or gopinath munde ne kaha tha ki pavaar endie main shaamil hona chaahate hai
 Munde had said, "if anyone is waiting for something, then he is Pawar himself and he is waiting to join the NDA
" ' bijepi netaa ke is bayaan ne us vivaad ko or tool de diya jo uddhav thakare ke us daawey se shuru hua tha ki unke virodh ke kaaran pavaar endie main shaamil nahin ho sake the
 Munde had said that Pawar had approached the NDA leaders
 munde ne kaha, 'maine uddhav se or phir maharashtra main gathbandhan ke anya bhagidaaron se is bare main baat kii thi
 We all decided that we will not allow Sharad Pawar and his NCP to join the NDA

 This line is spread between nine states and four union territories of the country
 aaie jaanate hai is tateey rekha ke bare main: Australian skipper Steve Smith, who scored an unbeaten 178-run knock in the Ranchi Test against India, proved why he is the number 1 batsman of the Test
 haalanki wo doharaa shatak nahin bana paae
 On this tremendous performance of Smith, his father Peter Smith said that he is very happy with his son's performance
 viraat ko chot laganaa durbhagyapurnapeter smith ne viraat kohli kaa zikr karte hue kaha he kikohali kaa chotil hona durbhagyapurna he
 It is bad for a player to be injured during a match
 jab kohli chotil hue the us dauraan main tivi par unhen dekh rahaa tha
 The injury to a team captain during a match is a big setback for the team
 steve chahta tha ki main match dekhne bharat aauuniske alaava peter smith ne kaha ki main ranchi test match dekhne ke liye offis se jaldi ghar laut aayaa tha or maine puraa match tivi par dekha
 Steve asked me several times to come to India
 taaki main live match kaa anand uthaa sakuun
 But i could not come there because of more work
 srilanka daure ke baad shandaar vapasipiter smith ne kaha ki mujhe garv he ki steve nebhartiya daure par ab tak shandarpradarshan kiya he kyonki in paristhitiyon main ran bananaa bahut mushkil hota he

 Let me tell you, the love life of Prince and Yuvika in 'bigg Boss 9' was quite popular
 prince ne yuvika ko impress karne ke liye dil ke aakaar kaa paratha banaaya tha
 The two came close to each other after winning Bigg Boss
 yuvika or prince ek mujeec video 'hello hello' main saath najar aa chuke hai
 Prince has become a judge after 'bigg Boss' and 'murti Bahu' and MTV Roadies
 vahiin yuvika ne 'to baat pakki' or 'da shaukeens' jaisi filmon main kaam kiya he
 Our films are also changing with the changing times
 pehle jahaan kisi film main special effects daalane ke liye maheenon tak set banaae jate the vahiin ab yah saare kaam computer janarated imageri (CGI) kii madad se ho rahe hai
 You might remember that flying sweep of the Harry Potter film and the dragons of Game of Thrones
 darasal, yah sara kamaal in CGI effects kaa hi hota he
 What is CGI? 3D computer graphics is also called CGI
 is effect ko aajkal badi screen or televijan main dhadlle se istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 We are surprised to see the sci-fi scenes of films
 dianasor jaisi filmon ko dekhakar ham chand minuton main hi usee daur main pahunch jate hai
 Actually, all that happens with the help of infects
 ham jis tarah kii abhaasi duniya dekhte hai uske peeche in computer janarated imageri kaa khaasaa yogadan hota he
 hi-fi Clothes and Skin Images: If you don't remember the x Men film, then let us remind you that CGI effects were behind the changing of Haley Berry's look in this film
 iske alaava spiderman, bitman, avatar orplanet of da epsjaisi filmon kii baari safalataa ke peeche or koi nahin balki CGI he
 Where can you do the course from? Now you must have understood that CGI can be a means of better employment for people besides making films successful
 bharat main IGNOU computer janarated imageri main diploma kaa course karaata he
 In our country, the institutes that teach this course are few
 lekin great britain kii southampton solent uniwarsity ke alaava canada or america main kai aise santhaan hai jo CGI se jude course karaate hai
 Career Scope This field has immense career prospects
 bharat main to CGI profeshnals kii badi demand hai
 There is a huge shortage of such experts in our country
 aise main saaf he ki agar aap isse judaa koi course karte hai to job kii bhi koi kami nahin hogi or paison kii bhi

 kumkum bhagya ke ek march ke episod main purab abhi ke liye gift lekar mehara house ke liye nikalataa he lekin nikhil trek se thokar markar purab ko ghayal kar detaa he
 Nikhil tells the injured east that he will never be able to join Abhi and Pragya
 vah purab kaa gift pairon se tod detaa he vahaan se chalaa jaataa he
 Pragya, on the other hand, is disturbed by the absence of East, how can the turmeric ceremony be canceled without her coming
 vahiin abhi pragna ko pareshaan dekhakar pareshaan ho jaataa he
 During the ceremony of turmeric, something happens that turmeric falls and the turmeric of tanu falls on Pragya, while turmeric falls on Abhi too
 pragna haldi saaf karne kamare main jaati he, uske peeche-peeche abhi vahaan pahunch jaataa he
 Pragya understands things about Abhi's mind, Abhi tells her how can this happen, Pragya says that she can listen to his mind because she is his best friend
 pragna ko aankh band karne ko kahkar vah man hi man sochataa he ki use pragna se uske dil kii baat puch leni chahie
 After a while garbage goes in Abhi's eye which Pragya helps her to remove
 iske baad abhi pragna ke chehre kii haldi saaf karata he, is dauraan donon ek duusare ke saath kuch achche pal bitaate hai
 The comments duusari taraf gharavaale charchaa karte hai ki jodi upar se banakar aati he
 They say that what happens is what happens
 mitali kahati he ki haldi to pragna ko lag gai, ab abhi kii shaadi kisase hogi, pragna se yaa tanu se
 Aaliya gets enraged at this and tells them to shut up
 is par daadi use daantati he ki sabakuch uuparavaale kii marji se hota he, use sanbhal janaa chahie varna shaadi main bhi kuch aisa hi hoga
 In tomorrow's episode, we will see that Abhi tells the family that someone got a call that East had an accident and is in the hospital
 pragna or baaki gharavaale purab ko dekhne aspataal jate hai, lekin aalia ko tanu par shaq ho jaataa he ki usne hi purab hamalaa karavaaya he
 Pragya goes to the room to clean the turmeric, Abhi reaches there after her
 pragna abhi ke man kii baaten samaj jaati he, abhi usase kahata he ki aisa kaise ho saktaa he to pragna kahati he ki vah uske man kii baat sun sakati he kyonki vah uski best friend he
 By telling Pragya to close his eyes, he thinks in his own mind that he should ask Pragya about his heart
 kuch der baad abhi kii aankh main kachra chalaa jaataa he jise nikaalane main pragna uski madad karti he
 After this Abhi cleans the turmeric of Pragya's face, during which both spend some good moments with each other
 tippaniyan Householders on the other hand discuss that the pair comes from above
 ve kehete hai ki jo jaisaa hota he uske saath vaisaa hi hota he
 Mithali says that the turmeric has started with Pragya, now whom will Abhi marry, Pragya or Tanu
 is par aalia bhadak jaati he or unhen chup rahane ke liye kahati he
 At this, grandmother scolds him that everything happens with the wishes of the above, he should be careful or else something similar will happen in the marriage too
 kal ke episod main ham dekhenge ki abhi gharavaalon ko bataata he ki kisi kaa phone aayaa tha ki purab kaa accident ho gaya he or vah aspataal main hai
 Pragya and the rest of the family go to the hospital to see the east, but Alia suspects Tanu that she is the one who attacked East
 duusari taraf gharavaale charchaa karte hai ki jodi upar se banakar aati he
 They say that what happens is what happens
 mitali kahati he ki haldi to pragna ko lag gai, ab abhi kii shaadi kisase hogi, pragna se yaa tanu se

 Sitting in the midst of the incessant stream of the Narmada River flowing every now and then, Saku Bai is thinking that this Narmada gave her a chance to lead a happy life, but those who run the vicious cycle of development have put her life in danger through this Narmada 
 saku bai ne apana haq na milane par jeevandaayini narmada main jaan dene kii thaan lee he
 Saku Bai, sitting on the water satyagraha in Khandwa district, is not the only woman who is determined to die for her rights
 khandwa ke saath harda main kai log narmada nadi main baithkar jal satyagrah kar rahe hai
 They are opposed to the danger of submergence in their villages due to increase in water level in Omkareshwar and Indira Sagar Dam 
 khandwa jile main narmada nadi par bane omkareshwar baandh main is baar pichley varsh kii tulana main adhik pani bharaa ja rahaa he
 The water level of this dam was earlier 189 meters, which was increased to 190
 5 meter tak pani bharaa ja chukaa he
 Due to this, 30 villages, including Ghoghal village, are in danger of drowning
 narmada bachaao andolan ke alok agarwal ne bataaya ki khandwa ke ghoghaal gaanv sahit aasapaas ke kai gaanv omkareshwar baandh main zyada pani bhare jane se doobane lage hai
 The Supreme Court has a clear directive that before raising the water level of the dam, arrangements should be made to rehabilitate the affected and give land in lieu of land, but neither the Madhya Pradesh government nor the Narmada Valley Development Authority is implementing it
 ghogal gaanv ke prabhavit kisaan narmada bachaao andolan kii aguwai main jal satyagrah kar rahe hai
 Water Satyagraha has been going on here for 13 days
 saku bai bhi is satyagrah main shaamil he
 She says that this river has made her life happy and now has put her life in crisis by citing development
 saku bai kahati hai ki jab tak unhen jameen ke badale jameen nahin mil jaati or sarkaar unke punarvaas kaa intjaam nahin karti, tab tak vah satyagrah jari rakhengi
 She will die if she does not get the right, but will not back down
 khandwa ke jiladhikari niraj dube ne bataaya ki jal satyagrah karne waalon se ve lagaataar charchaa kar rahe hai or unki maangon par aavashyak kadam bhi uthaae ja rahe hai
 Like the Omkareshwar dam, increasing the water level of Indira Sagar Dam in Harda has increased the risk of submerging 19 villages including Khardana
 prabhavit pariwaron ne apane haq ke liye jal satyagrah shuru kar diya he
 It has been eight days of this Satyagraha and he is saying the same thing that till he gets the right, he will stay in the water
 jal satyagrah ko rajya maanavadhikaar ayog ne bhi gambhirtha se liya he
 Along with this, instructions have been given that the water level of Omkareshwar dam should not be raised and such arrangements should be made that no agitator is killed

 The Rajasthan High Court on Wednesday reacted sharply to the functioning of the BCCI, saying that the BCCI is playing in the hands of others and is seeking revenge from Lalit Modi under the guise of the Rajasthan Cricket Association
 iske liye ham rajya ke cricket ko balidaan nahin hone denge
 The court said that Lalit Modi's resignation shows that in a sense, Modi has sacrificed his position for the game and is out of cricket
 bisisiai ke adhivaktaa ne kaha ki agar rajasthan cricket sangh (RCA) ko behaal kiya to lalit modi bhavishya main chunaav ladke waapas aa sakate hai isliye ham behaal nahin karenge
 On which the court reacted sharply and asked the RCA to suspend and restore the game
 court ne nirnay lene kaa samay dete hue faisla pesh karne ke liye 17 navambar kaa samay nirdhaarit kiya he
 The court also wrote in the order that if the BCCI wishes, it can do the restoring by taking any condition according to its doubts
 rajasthan cricket sangh ke sachiv ke adhivaktaa abhinav sharma ne nyaayalay ko bataaya tha kii bisisiai kii do aapattiyaan thim
 In it one said that Lalit Modi should be excluded from Nagaur district association and the claims filed against Rajasthan BCCI by Rajasthan Cricket Association in favor of Lalit, which has been done
 is par nyaayalay ne bisisiai ke adhivaktaa se poocha ki kyon nahin bisisiai swatah nirnay le letaa kyonki ab koi gatirodh nahin he

 For the first time in the era of fear of unnecessarily harassing taxpayers after demonetisation, a senior government official has now suggested a change in tax rules
 niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh arvind panagadhiya ne pradhanmantri karyaalay ko patr likhakar aise niyam banane kaa suzav diya he, jisase 8 november se 30 disambar ke bich puraane note jamaa karne vaale logon, khaskar mahilaon ko pareshaan na kiya jaae
 He said that there should be a 'liberal' formula in terms of annual tax exemption on women who save their money and deposit it in the bank
 indian express akhbaar ne sarkari sutron ke hawaale se yah khabar di he
 According to sources, Panagaria suggested in a letter written by PMO that 2
 5 lakh rupee tak ke puraane note jamaa karne waalon se koi sawaal na poocha jaae
 He said that this will provide relief to both taxpayers and tax officials, as a large number of people have deposited old notes in the last 50 days
 is dauraan 2 lakh se upar kii rakam jamaa karne vaale logon ke bare main jaankaree bainkon dwaara inakam tex vibhaag ko har din di jaati rahi
 Panagariya has suggested that a 'liberal' formula should be adopted in terms of annual savings for women
 gauratlab he ki bharat main zyaadaatar gruhaniyaan apane pati ke vetan yaa anyaaamadani kaa ek hissaa bachaakar ghar main yaa bainkon main rakhti hai
 Everyone knows this, so in this case Pangarhia suggests that a large part of the husband's income can be considered as a saving item for women
 panagadhiya ne kaha ki notebandi se ab tex ke niyamon main bhi kuch pherbadal kaa samay aa gaya he
 Tax rules can be simplified and the government can keep tax rates low
 gauratlab he ki is baat kii ashanka jataai ja rahi thi puraane note jamaa karne vaale taxperes ko bade paimaane par tex jaanch ke daayre main laane seinspector rajki vaapasi ho sakati he
 With this, the initiative taken to make the business easier in all departments will prove to be fruitless

 Apart from cricket fanatics, the National Para Athletics Games were being held in a college of public interest in the heart of the green fields of Matiala village of Bapudham in Ghaziabad, about 50 km from Delhi
 college ke baahar kai lakjri gaadiyaan khadi thi
 Many leaders were present on the stage in white kurta-pajamas, some trophies were placed on the table

 For the past three days, the disabled players have been going through similar struggles, whereas these players have been stopped on the first floor
 main manch ke peeche duusare kamaron main gaya to dekha class room ko hi kaamchalaun tareeke se rahane ke liye bana diya gaya tha
 It seemed as if this was the view of some of the villages in the village, where only the roof of the government school supports during the rains
 inhen adhbane kamaron main ek or khilaadi gita mili unke chehre par bahut saare chote-chote dane nikal aae the
 On asking, it was found that there are no fans and windows in the room, in such a situation, mosquitoes have created a fierce situation
 unhone hi bathroom dikhaaya, jahaan pani kaa naamo nishaan nahin tha, kuch khilaadiyon ne shaayad pot ko hi gusse main tod diya tha
 He said that for the last three days, by eating puri vegetable or curry rice, somehow they are participating in the competition here
 teen din se nahaaya tak nahin he
 Think if these players will win the competition here and participate in the Paralympics to be held next year
 iskaa jawaab jaanane ke liye jab aayojak yani upi para-athilytics association ke president kavindra choudhary ke paas gaye, to unhone chhutate hi kaha khub anti khabaren dikhaae ja rahe ho
 i said, Sir, here you have stopped the players in the middle of the field, there is no arrangement of fan and ramp
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri or hamaare mukhyamantri gaanv main khel karaane ke paksh main he, isliye gaanv main iskaa aayojan karavaaya ja rahaa he
 As far as the chaos is concerned, there is a lack of that too because other people have come with these disabled players
 jab 400 kii jagah 1200 log aa jaaenge to ham kya karenge
 On the one hand, i was happy at the enthusiasm of these players' game and on the other side, saddened by the white-collar and big baboon sparrow in which the future of so many players would not be trapped

 He is the admirer of this
 lekin salmaan khan to tubalite main pet badhaakar over imotional andaaj main najar aa rahe hai, vah unki box offis image se match nahin karata he
 This is the reason that while the morning shows on the first day of the tublight were empty, the seats and applause also ran in the hall, for which their fans are known
 point 2- sohail khan ko kyon liyasohail khan ke saath film main salmaan kaa bhai bhai kaa pyaar dikhataa he lekin isse zyada unke bare main baat karnaa jyaadati hogi
 Sohail has appeared on screen after a long time and it seems that his distance from the screen is also right
 behatar hota ki unki jagah kisi achche karactor artist ko liya jaataa he
 Doing this would have done something else
 point 3- mujeec bhi fustubalite film mujeec ke maamle main bhi fus he
 Except radio, you will not remember any other song
 jabaki salmaan kii filmon main mujeec bheed khinchne vaala ek jabardast factor rahaa he

 lekin mahaan film banane ke chakkar main unhone film kaa second half itnaa khinchaa he ki aap aaraam se bathroom hokar waapas aa sakate hai
 And you won't even think you've missed something
 Film Review: imotional drama he salmaan kii 'tubalite'point 5- itane imoshans bhi achche nahin lagatefilm kaa and bhi pachaana thodaa mushkil he
 To give a happy ending to the tubelight, it has been framed but after seeing it you will say the same - brother we are sure that it has become a bit much
 
 
 haa lekin tubalite main roshni dene vaale or bhi factor hai
 Radio Song, Om Puri's Presence, Zeeshan Ayub's Acting, Child Actor Matin's Cuteness, Chinese Actress Juju's Beauty are Factors that Help Salman's Tubelight Shine with Stardom

 There was uproar over the statement of Union Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma regarding the punishment of Afzal Guru
 ajtak se baatcheet main benny babu ne sansad hamale ke gunahagaar ke liye faansee kii jagah par umraqaid kii sajaa kii vakaalat kii
 As soon as the statement came on the 11th anniversary of the Parliament attack, there was a ruckus
 siyaasi dalon kii tikhi pratikriya ke baad mantri ji ne apana bayaan waapas le liya
 Beni Prasad Verma is the Steel Minister in the Manmohan government, but when Aaj Tak questioned the hanging of Afzal Guru, the accused in the Parliament attack, the terrorist was so sympathetic that the matter of heart came on the tongue
 bol naram pad gaye
 The minister was cast in the role of a judge
 afjal guru ko mili faansee kii sajaa ko supreme court kii muhar kaa bhi khyaal nahin rakhaa
 Forgot to file mercy petition in Rashtrapati Bhavan office
 media ke saamne afjal guru ke liye apni taraf se sajaa mukarrar kar di
 Do not be surprised at the words of the Steel Minister
 bayaan dekar vivaad khadey karnaa benny babu kaa purana shagal he
 Sometimes they tell inflation better for the common people, sometimes they do not lag behind in making trouble for the ministers of their own government by giving a statement
 ab ye to kisi ko nahin pataa ki benny prasad verma ne kya soch kar ye bayaan diya, lekin shivasena ne alpsankhyak voton par congress kii najar se jod diya or mantri ji par jubaani fanda kas diya
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut reacted sharply and asked if Beni Prasad Verma should be hanged if not Afzal
 kehete hai ki dhanush se nikali tir or jubaan se nikali baat waapas nahin aati
 But the game of making the impossible possible is politics
 bayaan par bavaal machaa, to benny babu ne you turn lene main thodi bhi der nahin kii

 unhone 28 disambar ko jab dilli ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee, tab har kisi ko bharosa tha ki chijen badal jaaengi, bhrashtachar khatm ho jayega
 Kejriwal had also shouted at Ramlila Maidan and said, 'nobody will give bribe, corruption has to be overthrown
 ' lekin aaj tak 'oparation aam aadmi' ke jariye jo khulaasa hua wo behad hi chaunkaane vaala he
 It seems that nothing has changed

 Operation Aam Admi, this sting operation is 100 per cent common man

 kejariwal sahab ne dilli kii janata ko shapath ke samay ek kasam dilaai thi
 We have to break that promise to show the truth
 700 litre muft pani ke bahaane bhi ghoosekhoriiske baad saamne aayaa wo sach, jo aam aadmi ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke sabase bade elaan se judaa he
 Yes, the promise of 700 liters of free water
 ji haa bas aapke paas paisa hona chahie, phir pani kitni bhi bahaiye, meter 700 litre se upar nahin badhegaa
 What happened to give free water to the people of Delhi, that the common man started traveling around the water board to install water meters
 pani muft mili naa mili, lekin plumber se lekar water meter ke reader tak paun barah ho gai
 Bribery to set up meter and bribe to do meter reading as well
 lut kaa haal ye he ki dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke sachivalay main kaam karne vaala staff bhi jal board ke karmiyon ko rishwat dene ko taiyaar he
 a CM employee confessed in front of the hidden camera till today that despite working in the secretariat, he had given 1500 rupees to install the meter himself, then his house had a water meter installed
 iske baad aaj tak kii team dilli ke mayur vihaar ilaake main jal board ke daftar pahunchin
 The meter reader objected to a separate water meter connection for the tenant
 meter reader baar-baar maukey par naa aae, isliye, hatheli garm karne ke alaava koi chaara nahin bachaa
 Actually, as per the rules, it was necessary for the tenant to install a separate meter, but if you are ready to pay a bribe, the rules can be put on hold
 pani kaa meter lagavaana ho, yaa meter kii ginati 700 litre pratidin se kam kerani ho, taaki aap muft pani kaa phayda uthaa saken, iske liye bhi paise dete rahiye
 Even after taking out the photo copy of the cell deed, where the team went to bribe in Delhi Jalboard till date, some bribe taker collided

 We arrived at the DC office in South West Delhi
 yahaan par makaan kii registry karaane se lekar, cell dead kii photo copy nikaalane par bhi rishwat ke daam tay hai
 In the DC office, Patwari does not give any paper out without giving money, we also got out a piece of ground paper, then Patwari had to pay Rs 500
 sach to ye he ki fard nikalwane ke liye sirf 5 rupee hi dene padate hai

 aage kii kahani or bhi mjedaar he
 The SDM of Kapashera himself told that it takes 5 to 10 rupees to get the firds removed, but when we talked about 500 rupees, he said to get the receipt
 yani rishwat kii bhi raseed
 2 thousand rupees for the renovation of RC is also of bad RTO office, where the common man's oath is being violated in public
 pashchim dilli ke raja garden ke transport othority ke daftar jab aaj tak kaa under cover reporter motorcycle kaa registration certificate yani aarasi banavaane pahunchaa to ghoosekhori ke kai raaj saamne aa gaye
 The data operator working in the RTO office clearly told our reporter that although the renewal of RC will cost a fee of five and a half hundred rupees, but if it is needed quickly without insurance, it will cost 2 thousand rupees

 5000 rupees tax office for VAT registration was also in a similar situation where we had to get the VAT registration of our firm, but the truth which came out here was very shocking, we did not get officers here, but welcome Found the agent for sure
 registration karaane ke liye yun to fees 5500 rupee hai, lekin agent khuleam 10 hajaar se zyada maang rahaa tha
 That means a fee of 5500 and bribe to get 5 thousand work done

 They live in Delhi most of the time
 police kaa kahana he ki sisitivi ke aadhaar par choron kii pahchaan kii ja rahi he
 At present, no one has been arrested in this case
 uttar pradesh kii do loksabhaa siton ke upachunaav ke maddegenerbasapaane koi ummidavaar nahin utaarne kaa faisla kiya he
 Also, there is talk of giving undisclosed support to the candidates of Samajwadi Party
 khud mayawati ne sapa ke saath gathbandhan kii khabaron kaa khandan karte hue kaha he ki bijepi ko haraane vaale ummidavaaron kaa unki party samarthan karegi
 Not only this, he said in the context of the current by-election that his party is not going to field any candidates
 saath hi kaha ki hamaare party kaaryakarta bijepi ummidavaar ko haraane ke liye kaam karenge
 At the same time, there was a discussion that an agreement has been reached between Samajwadi Party and BSP to contest elections together
 haalanki baat gathbandhan tak bhale na pahunchi ho, lekin basapa dwaara sapa ummidavaar ko samarthan dene ke kai myne saamne nikalakar saamne aa rahe hai
 There are three main reasons behind the support of BSP in Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections
 1
 The decision by the BSP in view of the by-elections in Gorakhpur and Phulpur seats may be an attempt to test this alliance before forming a big coalition in the 2019 elections
 2
 At the same time, according to sources, the deal is also coming out about the three elections in SP and BSP behind this support
 iske tahat sapa ko loksabhaa upachunaav or vidhaan parishad me basapa samarthan degi to iske evaz main basapa ko sapa rajyasabha seat ke liye chunaav main apana samarthan degi
 Now Congress will be compelled to support this alliance
 3
 Also, now Mayawati's open deal with Congress can be done
 unhone khud kaha ki agar congress ke saat vidhayak agar upi main bispi ko rajyasabha main samarthan denge, tabhi madhya pradesh main congress ko rajyasabha chunaav main bispi samarthan karegi
 In such a situation, the BSP is currently pursuing a 'one hand two - one hand low' policy
 gathbandhan se kiya inkaaravahin isse pehle mayawati ne khud uttar pradesh kii do loksabhaa siton ke upachunaav ke maddesner samaajawaadee party ke saath gathbandhan kii khabaron kaa basapa supremeo ne khandan kiya he
 Putting to rest speculation of the alliance, he made it clear that such information is just a rumor
 upi ke siem yogi adityanath or dipti siem keshav prasad maury ke istife ke baad gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa seat par ho rahe upachunaav main sapa or bijepi ne edi-chotii ke jor lagaae hue hai
 According to tradition, Bahujan Samaj Party is not participating in the by-elections in these seats
 is charchaa ke bich hi ravivaar shaam basapa pramukh mayawati ne khud morcha sambhala or gathbandhan par apni party kaa rukh saaf kiya
 He said, 'there are some mischievous elements who are spreading these rumors
 is kism kii galat afvaah failaane waalon kii ant main fajihat hi hoti he
 However, Mayawati called this undisclosed support separate from the electoral alliance
 unhone kaha, 'upi main haal hi main rajyasabha or vidhanparishad main hone vaale chunaav main bijepi ko haraane ke liye espi or bispi ke dwaara ek duusare ko vot transfar kar diya jaataa he to ye koi chunavi gathbandhan nahin

 'chunautiyaan barkararpm modi or america raashtrapati trump kii yah mulaakaat us samay hui he, jab donon deshon ke bich apane-apane hiton ko lekar takaraav chal rahaa he
 Before meeting PM Modi in Japan, Trump had also made it clear by tweeting that he would not accept India's decision to impose tariffs on American goods, but India's intentions were also elevated
 bharat ne usee dauraan yahaan aae america videsh sachiv se saaf kah diya tha ki bharat apane hit main faisle legaa na ki america ke kehane se
 Now, to see how confident Prime Minister Narendra Modi breaks the chakraview of America after the victory? Recently America threatened India to abolish the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) status, so India too But prepared to impose higher tariff

 Kamal Parmar has made a 'sidewalk school' by putting a bench on the pavement in front of his house

 When we asked Kamal Parmar about the idea of a pavement school, he said that a few years ago, when i was coming out of my factory, i saw that some children were coming for exams
 inke haath main paper or chehre par khushi thi
 i asked those children why are you so happy? The children said that our examination has been good so we are happy
 maine jab pariksha kaa paper haath main lekar bacchon se sawaal puche tab mushkil se ek sawaal kaa jabaav unhen pataa tha
 At that time i thought that something should be done for these children
 iske baad main garib bacchon muft main padhaane kaa kaam karne laga
 The children coming here for education come from a very poor family, whose parents make a living by earning wages
 unke bachche skool se chuttee ho jane kaa baad camel parmaar ke is footpath skool main padhane ke liye aate hai, ye skool shaam 6 baje se 9 baje tak chalata he, jahaan bacchon ko raat kaa khaanaa bhi khilaayaa jaataa he
 Dhara Sogathia, a student coming to study, said that my mother works as a householder, and Papa works as a plumber
 hamen yahaan acha padhaate hai
 Hindi, English is all taught
 khaanaa bhi khilaate hai isliye ham yahaan padhane ke liye aate hai
 Children studied with Kamalji have now grown up
 koi doctor to koi engeniper ban gaya he, ab wo bhi kamalji ke is kaam main unki madad karte hai, or bacchon ko padhaate hai
 Initially Kamal Parmar was alone but gradually people came to know about his work and people came forward to help him

 If the basic need like sex is being left behind in your life or your partner is stealing your eyes
 yaa phir aapke sambandhon main mithaas khatm ho chuki he to ek baar apane ghar, apane bedroom or sambandh banane kii disha ke vaastu kii jaanch jarur kara len
 Because according to the famous architect Naresh Singal, the reason behind this is the object defect
 single kaa kahana he ki vaastu kaa sex se gaharaa sambandh he
 Couples are the foundation of life on sex and nowadays the root cause of fast-breaking relationship is lack of sex relationship between husband and wife
 naresh single ke anusaar sex sambandh main kami yaa yon atrupti kaa bhi sidhaa sambandh vaastu dosha se he
 According to Singal, the object is important in maintaining freshness in sex and love affairs
 agar aapke ghar kaa uttar-pashchim (NW), doshapurn he to aapaki sex ke prati ruchi ghat jaati he
 Not only this, if there is wrong color on the walls of your house and bedroom, the plot in which your house is built and the size of your bedroom is not correct, there are many reasons which cause bitterness in your life and extra marital affairs
 single ke anusaar agar aap apane bed ke neeche yaa uske rack main juute-chappal rakhte hai to vah pati-patni ke rishte ke liye thik nahin hota
 Apart from this, if you have a double bed for a happy married life, then spread a mattress with the same big one in it
 If this is not possible, place a thick mat between the two mattresses and then place a sheet over them
 aisa na hone par pati-patni ke bich jhagade kii sambhaavna hameshaa bani rahati he
 Do not put three objects in the bedroom, such as three flowers, three candles, etc
 single ke anusaar pati-patni ko apane sir kii taraf pani nahin rakhana chahie or unke bedroom kii deevaaron kaa rang halkaa or ruhani hona chahie na ki chatkh
 In order to enjoy the relationship fully, the husband and wife should make a connection in the south-west (SW) direction of the room
 iske alaava agar aapke ghar kaa uttar-purv (NE) nahin he yaa kataa hua he yaa golakaar main he yaa doshapurn he to isse santan prapti main dikkat aati he or agar santan ho bhi to vah doshapurn ho sakati he

 One thing that will be blamed on my tongue, but i still say that when i was young, i got a terrible sentence, because i got caught in a terrible fire, when i was alive i knew that i was ugly
 i am jaise suhaani subah daraavnee raat main palat gai ho
 
 
 
 main baahar jane se ghabaraane laga or ghar main baithkar geet banane laga jitna bhi bhayanak tha
 
 
 my face
 
 
 utane madhur the mere geet
 The world tortured me, but i fell in love with my songs and i kept shouting that you love the moonlight nights and i rain with my eyes
 mere geeton ne hajaaron ko lutaa meri mulaakaat
 
 
 But i never met anyone
 ek din khat aayaa maine tumhaare geeton main shanti pai agar mulaakaat hui to na jane kya kar baithungi
 i felt this beautiful beauty, call it, call it, i can stand with full strength by showing this ugly face, i called her how beautiful she came, soft than Shabnam and like me, despair in front of innocent
 
 
 main cheharaa chupa ke baaten karata rahaa, mere geet shubhamane the or meri jubaan pe
 
 
 
 maine shaadi kaa prastaav pesh kiya or vah khush thim
 She said yes
 
 
 mujhe manjuur he
 i was scared myself, i shouted, "who are you?" 
 
 kahaan se ai ho tum
 
 
 The Slowly shedding her tears, she said that 
 
 main to ek andhi hum
 i looked into his eyes, there was love in his eyes, then i said, the arrow that is not the eye of the eye is the heart to say but not the heart
 
 
 tippaniyan Arrived in films but after coming, that beautiful success is a chance to climb the ladder, this sehra is your head
 
 That you are the one who made me a star from an actor
 star se super star banaaya
 i don't understand which alphabets to thank you for
 pyaar aap mujhe bhejte rahe
 
 
 
 pyaar vah mujhe miltaa rahaa, lekin us pyaar ko main kabhi waapas lautaa nahin paaya, lekin jo bhi kahana chaahunga, jin alphaajon main bhi aapkaa shukriya adaa karnaa chaahunga
 
 
 That will be the truth of my heart
 meri eemaandaaree hogi, meraa jameer hoga
 Today my heart lightened by talking to you, talking, and i thank you
 mujhe khud ko acha lag rahaa he ki chaliye is bahaane aapse mulaakaat hui
 No one gets the ability to say this to anyone, no one gets this ability to say what he says, there are many stones here but no heart
 to doston aapkaa ek hissedaar main bhi hum or jaise maine pehle bhi kaha ki aapane aapkaa keemtee vakt nikaal kar aap kahie pyaar tha
 You were present here and in such a large number, i would say here, thank you very much, thank you and thank you very much! jo dialog maine bolnaa tha vah dialog unhone puraa kiya kyonki main dialog bhul gaya or uske baad mujhe bahut daant padi, main bahut royaa bhi
 i said, brother Rajesh Khanna, if you want to become an actor, a line is not spoken to you
 shame kii baat he, laanat he tumpe
 i whipped myself a lot and i said that i can never become an actor, but still understand the smile of God, understand the stubbornness, i said, i will do something, i will tell
 main jab filmon main aayaa to meraa koi godfadar nahin tha
 i did not have a relative or a hand in the film industry
 main aayaa thru da united producers film fere tailent contest se
 In the Contest printed Filmfare, Times of India, we took scissors, cut it, filled it and wrote there please send three photographs
 hamane photo bheji
 We were called
 times of india main tha united producers bahut bade-bade producers the, chaahe vah chopra sahib the, bimal roy the, eses dravid the
 
 
 Shakti was feudal, there were many
 unhone kaha ki hamane aapako ek dialog bheja he vah yaad kiya aapane? to main saamne kursi par baitha tha
 And he was such a big producer in a big table, in line, i felt like being court martial
 jaise abhi bandook nikaalenge or mujhe maar daalenge, goli chalaa denge, kyonki saamne akeli ek kursi thi bas
 i said that i have read the same dialogue, but the dialogue that you have, you have not told what its characterization is that the hero explains to his mother that i love a dancing person but me
