 kailash-maansarovar yatra ko china dwaara roke jane par vishwa hindu parishad ne tikhi pratikriya di he
 He says that all were shocked when China stopped the kailash-mansarovar Yatra from Nathu La border
 abhi tak lagata tha ki iske peeche shaayad prakritik vipadaa hi mukhya kaaran rahi hogi
 But it has now become clear from the correspondence and statements issued by the Chinese authorities that the only reason for stopping this important journey is the indelible hunger and grandeur of regional expansion

 The VHP appeals to the Government of India to take the subject of the Mansarovar Yatra more seriously and warns China not to let hunger for land become an obstacle in this journey

 The Uttar Pradesh unit of BJP on Friday urged the Chief Minister of the state Akhilesh Yadav to break his silence on what was said in the assembly by the accused in the Kunda murder case and former minister Raja Bhaiya
 bijepi ke pradesh pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak ne kaha ki purv mantri raja bhaiya ne vidhansabha main die gaye apane jawaab main kaha tha ki kunda hatyakand main namjad do aaropee ghatana ke din unke saath mukhyamantri nivas par maujuud the, or akhilesh ne unka haalchaal bhi poocha tha, phir in sawaalon ke jawaab mukhyamantri kyon nahin de rahe hai
 Pathak said that this statement of Raja Bhaiya was also recorded in the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly and why Akhilesh is still silent on his claim
 pathak se yah puche jane par ki kya sibiai kii team ko pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav se bhi is maamle main poochtacha kerani chahie, to unhone kaha ki sibiai agar aavashyak samajhegi to aisa jarur karegi lekin sawaal yah he ki mukhyamantri khud in daavon kaa jawaab kyon nahin de rahe hai
 Meanwhile, the state unit of BJP accused the Chief Minister of discriminating against compensation as well
 pathak ne aarope lagaaya ki ek taraf to mukhyamantri kunda hatyakand main peediton ko unke ghar jaakar muaavje kaa elaan karte hai, lekin yahi maang jab bhaajapa uthaati he to vah us ni gaur nahin karte

 sibiai jaanch kii maang isliye ki gai kyonki soobe kii police par bijepi ko vishwaas nahin he

 India has retaliated against the US for solar energy policies in the World Trade Organization (WTO)
 maamle main bharat ne america ke kanoonee daawey ko puri tarah se khaarij kar diya he
 Also, the WTO has a new argument in favor of its solar energy industry
 darasal, pichley maheene america ne maamle ko lekar bharat ke khilaaf nae sire se mukademebaaji shuru kii thi
 In the WTO, the US argued that India had failed to follow the WTO decision on solar energy
 americanka kahana tha ki maamle main bharat kii nitiyaan solar cells or modules ke videshi aapurtikartaaon ke khilaaf hai
 This is discriminating against foreign suppliers
 somvaar ko WTO ne ek byan jari kar kaha ki bharat ne vishwa vyapaar sanghathan ke niyamon ke anusaar apni nitiyon main badlaav kar diya he
 India said that America's claim in the case is completely baseless
 bharat ne jor dekar kaha ki maamle ko lekar america kii shikaayat vaid nahin hai
 The US has failed to follow the wto's correct legal action process in this case
 maamle main usne vyapaar pratibandh ke kisi khaas str ko shaamil karne kaa lop kiya he
 India said that this claim of the US is a result of serious bias regarding solar energy policies
 bharat ne kaha ki agar maamle main kanoonee prakriya kaa puri tareeke se paalan kiya jayega, to vah sahi sabit hoga
 Therefore, on December 19, 2017, the US complaint is outright rejected
 navinikaran urja ek aisa kshetra ban gaya he, jisamen pratispardhaa kaaphi bad gai he

 The aim was to address the energy shortage in Asia's third largest economy without any pollution
 americane saal 2013 main maamle main WTO main shikaayat kii thi
 He said that US solar exports to India have fallen by 90 percent
 iske baad WTO main america ne yah cese jeet liya tha
 The WTO judges had said that India had broken trade rules using indigenous sales and modules
 ab maamle main bharat ke kadam se na sirf america balki vaishvik pratispardhaon se bhartiya saura urja udyog ko sangrakshan milegaa
 In the WTO last week, India said it was going to put temporary traffic on solar cells, modules and panels following a petition from the domestic solar power industry

 Whether it is the format of the tournament or the rule of rain or the politics of security, the World Cup has been associated with controversies since the beginning of the World Cup and now that the subcontinent is ready for this cricketing great, the ICC snatched the match from Kolkata before the tournament
 Added controversy
 vishwa cap main samay badhane ke saath kuch na kuch aisi baaten hoti rahi jo kabhi kabhi to khel par haaavee ho gayi thi
 South Africa's havoc of the 1992 rain rule, Australia and the West Indies refusing to play in Sri Lanka in 1996, Shane Warne being caught in 2003 for banned drug use and protests over Zimbabwe's political situation and Bab Woolmer's 2007 World Cup During the death, there were major incidents which dominated the news related to the World Cup
 vishwa cap jab 1975 main shuru hua to pehle match main hi bhartiya ballebaaj sunil gavaskar ne 174 gend par naabad 36 ran banaaye jisase iske 60 over ke praaroop kii kadi aalochana kii gayi thi
 During the match between Sri Lanka and Australia at the Oval during the same World Cup, members of the Sri Lankan Tamil group entered the ground and lay on the pitch, forcing the match to stop
 iske chaar saal baad 1979 main vishwa cap kairi paikar kii kaali saaya padati najar aa rahi thi lekin aakhri maukey par sab kuch sahi ho gaya
 However, the weather was not good during this tournament, which saw many low-scoring matches
 austrailia or newjiland main 1992 ke vishwa cap main barish ke ajeebogareeb niyam ko dakshin africa or england ke bich khele gayi semifinal match ke baad khub kosa gaya
 Rain came when South Africa needed 22 runs off 13 balls to win
 khel shuru hone par uske saamne ek gend par 21 ran banane kaa asambhav lakshya tha
 In the 1996 World Cup for the second time in the Indian subcontinent, Australia and West Indies refused to participate in the match in Sri Lanka
 srilanka ko in donon match ke ank de diye gayi or is tarah se vah keval ek match jitkar quarter final main pahunch gaya or aakhir main champion bana
 The semi-final between India and Sri Lanka played in Kolkata in the same tournament was not completed due to spectators' fuss
 vishwa cap 1999 ke shuru main hi safed duk gend ko lekar kaaphi charchaa chali, kyonki yah kaaphi kadi thi
 South African coach Woolmer created a new debate by devising a way to talk to his players on the field through radio contact
 isisi ne baad main is par pratibandh laga diya tha
 Prior to the start of the 2003 World Cup in South Africa, the issue of sponsorship of the players was caught up, which made it suspicious for the leading cricketers of India to participate in the tournament
 shen warn ko toornament se purv ke pareekshanon main dauratic ke seven kaa doshi paaya gaya jiske liye unhen ek saal kaa pratibandh jhelana padaa tha
 On March 18, 2007, a day after the Pakistani team lost to Ireland in the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies, its coach Woolmer died in a hotel room, causing much controversy
 final main austrailian adam gilcrist kaa ballebaaji gloves ke bich squash kii gend daalana bhi vivaadon se ghira rahaa or srilanka cricket ne isisi se isaki shikaayat kii
 Not only this, controversy erupted due to the umpires' failure in the final
 kharaab roshni ke kaaran jab khel roka gaya to austrailia ne jeet kaa jashn manaanaa shuru kiya lekin ampiron ne kaha ki abhi match puraa nahin hua 
 Finally, the players had to get down to play three overs in a very low light
 isisi ne kadaa ravaiya apanaate hue is match ke ampiron or referi ko 2007 ke twanti-20 vishwa cap kii adhikariyon kii team main nahin liya tha
 In the World Cup 2011, the controversies started when the host was taken away from Pakistan due to security reasons
 kolkata main kaam puraa nahin hone ke kaaran isisi ne usase match chin liya jabaki canada ke pakistan mul ke khilaadiyon ko vija milane main deree hui
 Canadian players have got visas but the Kolkata issue may take hold
 loksabhaa chunaavon main party kii jabardast jeet se utsahit bijepi ko haryana main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi jeet kaa puraa bharosa he
 The party is confident of victory and believes that the magic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also work in Haryana and the party will form the government on its own
 aaj tak website ko die ek exclusive intervyuu main party ke rashtriya sachiv or haryana bijepi ke sah-prabhareedow
 Anil Jain said that the BJP will not form an alliance with the Indian National Lok Dal to form the government under any circumstances
 gauratlab he ki tamaam raajnneetik uthapatak ke bich haryana main jald hi vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Although the BJP has suffered a humiliating defeat in the by-election in Uttarakhand after the Lok Sabha elections, the party is considering its position as strong in Haryana
 chunaav kii taiyaariyon or is babat tamaam muddon par dow
 Jain shared his impeccable opinion
 aaj tak web: kya is baar haryana congress mukt ho jayega?anil jain:ye to nishchit he ki haryana congress mukt ho rahaa he
 Although the Congress will definitely get some seats, in Haryana the Congress will neither come into the government nor will it be the main opposition party
 kul milakar haryana main bhi congress kii haalat loksabhaa chunaav kii tarah hi hone vaali he
 Aaj Tak Web: Is the BJP believing that Modi's magic will work in Haryana as well? Anil Jain: Yes, Modi's magic will work in Haryana as well, there is no scope for any doubt
 kyonki loksabhaa chunaav main haryana main jo parinaam aae hai wo sabake saamne he
 Aaj Tak Web: It is generally seen that the BJP declares the leadership before the elections, in such a situation, who will be the CM candidate of Haryana? Anil Jain: It does not always happen
 2007 main jo uttarakhand kaa chunaav hua tha usamen bhi hamane chunaav ke pehle siem candidet dikalair nahin kiya tha
 Whether to declare CM before election
 kise karnaa he ye hamaari party kii parliamentry board ko tay karnaa he isliye is mudde par philhal koi tippanee karnaa uchit nahin hoga
 Aaj Tak Web: Are Captain Abhimanyu and Rao Inderjit in the race for CM? Anil Jain: See, it is not appropriate to comment on one name at the moment because the party has not taken a stand on this subject
 kai aise or bhi naam hai jisamen sambhaavnaaen hai, lekin aakhri faisla party ko milakar karnaa he
 Aaj Tak Web: What is special for the Congress leaders who have joined BJP? Anil Jain: The list of such people is very long
 bijepi ne kisi bhi netaa ko kisi shart par bijepi main shaamil nahin kiya he
 All the leaders who have joined BJP have joined the BJP, saddened by the policies and leadership of the Congress
 jis tarah se janata kaa bijepi ke prati aakarshan badha he or congress jaise bade dalon ke netaa apni party chhodkar bijepi kii taraf aa rahe hai
 This shows that the confidence of the people in the BJP has increased, and they are finding it and therefore joining the BJP
 aaj tak web: tikat bantwaare par bijepi kii kya ranneeti he?anil jain:tikat bantwaare par kuch khaas ranneeti nahin he
 It depends on our worker and organization
 kshetra ke saamaajik sameekaran ko dekhte hue hi tikat die jate hai
 Aaj Tak Web: The effect of 'modi's magic' in Uttarakhand by-election did not show anything special
 haryana chunaav main bijepi par uskaa kya asar padegaa?anil jain:uttarakhand kii do-teen siton ke parinaam ko ham bahut gambhirtha se nahin le sakate
 The result of Uttarakhand by-election will not have any effect on Haryana
 aaj tak web: chunaav main bijepi ke mukhya mudde kya hai?anil jain:haryana main is vakt sabase bada mudda congress ke kushasan se mukti paanaa he
 The people of the state are plagued by the Congress government
 yahaan kii sarkaar aakanth bhrashtachar main dubi he
 Everyone is aware of what the leaders in the government have done to make their masters happy
 haryana ko ek tarah se property dling kaa adda bana diya gaya he
 The way farmers' lands have been looted throughout the state is visible
 kisaanon kii jameen saste daam par lekar mahange daamon main bechi gai he
 The compensation of 1 acre of land for which 8 lakh rupees was given, the government has sold the same land for crores
 mere hisaab se vahaan ke logon ke liye ye sabase bada mudda he
 The second issue is the industry business, which has been thrashed by the Congress government
 puure rajya main udyog dhandhe kii haalat bahut kharaab he or inamen se kai to band hone kii kagaar par aa gaye hai
 The Hooda government has made unbalanced development in the name of development
 puure rajya main bijli, sadakon or pani kii haalat bilkul kharaab he
 The government has not even done the work of increasing the irrigated land of the state, due to which, despite being an agricultural state, Haryana is lagging behind the rest of the states in agriculture growth rate
 sarkaar ne utpaadan, distribyushan or kisaanon ko uskaa vaazib daam diya jaae, is vyavastha ko bhi thik tareeke se lagu nahin kiya he
 There are many other issues on which we will go among the public
 aaj tak web: chunaav purv survey ke mutabik bijepi haryana main clin sweep karne ja rahi he, kya aap isse ittefaq rakhte hai?anil jain:bilkul, is baat main kahin koi andeh nahin he
 It is certain that the BJP is going to form the government on its own in Haryana
 aaj tak web: kya bijepi INLD ke saath gathbandhan karegi?anil jain:nahin, bijepi INLD ke saath koi gathbandhan nahin karegi
 However, there is no talk of stubbornness and stubbornness in politics
 ye paristhiti par nirbhar karata he
 But the decision of the alliance in our party is taken by the central leadership and it is they who will put the final seal on it
 aaj tak web: haryana main jat rigerveshan ek bada mudda he, is par bijepi kii kya raay he?anil jain:dekha jaae to rigerveshan ek aisa mudda he, jiskaa koi bhi party virodh nahin karti
 It is directly related to the vote bank
 haalanki bijepi maanati he ki rigerveshan ek samvedansheel mudda he or isaki charchaa deshbhar main nae sire se kii jaani chahie
 There should be discussion on which class or caste people should be given a reservation
 koun se log rigerveshan kaa kitne baar phayda uthaa chuke hai
 This is a serious matter
 nishchit taur par chunaav ke baad hi is par thik tareeke se charchaa ho sakati he
 Aaj Tak Web: Nowadays the issue of C-SAT is hot in Civil Services Examination
 kya ek hindi bhashi rajya hone ke naate haryana chunaav main ye mudda bijepi par baari pad saktaa he?anil jain:congress ne hi si-sat ko 2011 main lagu kiya tha or phir unhone is mudde par koi kaam nahin kiya
 Our government is only 75 days and the relief that the central government has given to the students in such a short time is a commendation-a-compliment and we will get the benefit in the elections of Haryana as well as other states
 aane vaale samay main centre sarkaar is mudde par or bhi kaam karegi

 a difficult paper will be made for children pursuing further career in Mathematics, while in Mathematics there will be an easy paper for weak children
 ye yojana un students ke liye he, jinhen ganit kaa vishay kaaphi mushkil lagata he or dar rahata he ki kahin vah fail na ho jaaen
 To overcome this fear, CBSE is preparing to plan two mathematics papers
 vahiin sibiesai ne kaha he is faisle ke peeche makasad ye he ki jo students aage kii padhai ganit vishay main nahin karnaa chaahate hai, unke liye paper aasaan hoga, taaki vah pariksha main aasaani se paas ho sake or jo students apni aage kii padhai ganit vishay ke saath karnaa chaahate hai, unke liye paper kathin hoga
 The results of the JEE Main Paper-2 released by CBSE, are seen as such that this decision is not fully approved yet
 board ne desh bhar ke kai skulon or teachers se is prastaav ke liye suzav maange the
 After which the board got suggestions from many schools
 aapako bataa den, ye prastaav kaksha 9,10, 11 or 12 ke liye he
 At the same time, the board argued that there are many students who are good in the rest of the subject but not good in mathematics
 aise main is prastaav ke lagu hone ke baad un students ke upar se tag hat jayega ki vah skool ke dinon main ganit main achche nahin the
 It will be difficult for the engineer to take the maths test
 Students who want to do further engineering and are preparing for Joint Entrance Test (JEE), the board will make the maths exam difficult for them
 vahiin duusari ore jo students medical kii padhai karne ke liye neshnal eligibility test (NEET) kii pariksha dene vaale hai unke liye ganit kaa paper aasaan rakhaa jayega
 CBSE said that after the implementation of this proposal, it will be sent to NCERT so that it can be included in the celebrations

 PM Modi included six mps from Bihar in the cabinet
 nityanand ko chhodkar baaki sabhi puraane chehron ko tavajjo di he
 While in Bihar, bjp's ally Janata Dal United (JDU) backed out of joining the Modi cabinet just before the swearing-in ceremony
 mana ja rahaa he ki mantrimandal main jediu se ek mantri banaae jane se nitish kumaar kaa jaateey sameekaran set nahin ho paa rahaa tha, isiilie jediu ne kadam peeche khinch liye
 On Thursday, just before the swearing-in ceremony of the Modi cabinet, JDU national president Nitish Kumar made it clear that he was with the BJP but his party's people agreed to the proposal to accept the formal invitation to sign in the cabinet
 Did not give isliye wo sarkaar main shaamil nahin honge
 Senior JDU leader KC Tyagi had said that we are neither dissatisfied nor angry, but no minister will be made from our party
 narendra modi kii netritv vaali endie ke mantrimandal main nitish kumaar jediu ke liye do mantri pad maang rahe the, inamen ek cabinet or ek swatantra prabhaar
 According to sources, this was initially agreed between the two, but later the BJP approved the grant of the same ministerial post to allies including JDU
 is formule par shivasena taiyaar ho gai, lekin jediu ne apane jaateey sameekaran ko dekhakar kadam peeche khinch liya
 Actually, earlier Nitish Kumar wanted JDU General Secretary RCP Singh for the Cabinet and Lalan Singh as Minister of State (independent Charge)
 nitish kumaar modi ke mantrimandal main jediu ke cote se ek cabinet mantri ke formule kii baat maan lete to kise vah mantri banaae or kise nahin, is par pasopesh kii sthiti main hote
 In such a situation, if RCP Singh was made a minister from JDU, then Nitish Kumar would have been accused of making a minister a minister from his caste, ie Kurmi
 isse unako bihar main agadi jati ke log naaraaz hone kaa khatra he
 That is why Nitish Kumar wanted Lalan Singh to be made a minister along with RCP Singh
 lalan singh bhoomihaar jati se aate hai
 In such a situation, Nitish wanted to maintain the balance of castes in Bihar by making him a minister
 aise main bijepi ke ek mantri ke formule ke pachade main padane ke bajaay nitish kumaar se mantrimandal se apane aapako alag kar liya
 Actually assembly elections are due in 2020 in Bihar
 aise main centre ke bajaay vah abhi rajya par zyada focus rakhana chaahate hai
 He does not want to take any kind of risk before the Bihar assembly elections
 nitish na to bijepi se abhi koi rishta kharaab karnaa chaahate hai or na hi bihar main apana jaateey sameekaran

 It is worth noting that Naxalites attacked Pidmail village of Sukma district two days ago and killed 7 STF personnel
 chhattisgarh main pichley teen dinon se naksaliyon kaa utpaat jari he
 On Saturday, around 9-10 am, 7 soldiers were killed and 11 soldiers were injured in an encounter in Pidmail forest
 ravivaar ko kanker main naksaliyon ne mining company kii 18 gadiyon ko aag ke hawaale kar diya tha
 Naxalites attacked the BSF camp at Pakhanjur in Kanker during the intervening night of sunday-monday, in which a BSF jawan was killed
 naksaliyon ne somvaar ko dantewada or kanker main hamale kiye
 Under the Kirandul police station of Dantewada, a police anti-mine vehicle was blasted on cholnar-kirandul road
 hamale main ek jawan ghatnasthal par hi shahid ho gaya
 Three of the 11 jawans injured in the blast died in hospital during treatment
 is hamale main allaudin khan, lalluram pradhan, jaiprakash paswan or driver shiva kashyap shahid hue
 State Congress President Bhupesh Baghel said that the state government does not have the ability to control the Naxalites
 mukhyamantri jab tak raman singh hai, is samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin ho saktaa
 Raman only knows how to make flowers
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki visphot main 50 kilo ardex kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 The vehicle that was flown had about 12 jawans on board
 ve talaashi abhiyaan se laut rahe the
 The jawans had reached near Cholnar camp when Naxalites numbering 60-70 came and exploded
 visphot ke baad ve javaanon par andhadhundh firing karne lage or javaanon se hathiyaar luutane kii koshish bhi kii
 Due to the camp being nearby, the backup team immediately reached the spot and fired back
 kaaphi der tak chali firing ke baad naksali bhaag gaye
 Dantewada SP Kamal Lochan Kashyap said that the firing has stopped and search operations are now being conducted in the area

 The Government of Maharashtra may face many difficulties in the budget session
 ashok chavaan, toll, adarsh ghotaale, bijli dar or elbiti ke mudde ke bich 12 vidheyak paas karnaa sarkaar ke liye kisi bhi keemat par aasaan nahin hone vaala he
 During the four-day budget session starting on Monday, passing 12 bills in front of the opposition, who have taken a tough stand to demand action against the Adarsh society scam, toll, LBT and 16 tainted ministers, would be equivalent to chewing NACO
 vipaksh ne saaf kar diya he kii jab tak in muddon par baat nahin hogi tab tak vah kuch bhi nahin hone degaa
 The MNS, which is agitating about the issue of tolls, is also not ready to back down on this issue
 lekin sarkaar kaa kahana he kii wo sabhi mudde par charchaa karne ko taiyaar he or toll ke mudde par bhi vah charchaa karne ko taiyaar he
 At the same time, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan has said that every issue should be discussed and under the rule we are ready to discuss any issue
 vahiin shivasena 16 daagi mantriyon ke khilaaf kaarywahi ko lekar sarkaar ko gherne kaa man bana rahi he
 The issue of electricity can also become a problem for the government
 shivasena or bijepi donon ne sarkaar ke bharshtachar ko mahangi bijli dar ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Shiv Sena leader Subhash Desai said that after a lot of difficulty, 20 per cent of Maharashtra got relief but Mumbai did not
 aisa kyon
 
 kya mumbai ke log maharashtra main nahin aate
 Amidst all these issues, it has to be seen how the government is able to pass 12 bills before the elections
 desh main khule main shouch kii aadat badalane main kanoon va janajagriti abhiyaan bhale hi apekshanukool safal na hue hon, magar madhya pradesh ke baitool jile kii ek panchayat kii 'anokhi camentry' ne is buraai par pabandi lagane main safalataa pai he
 Now almost every person of this village has started using the toilet of the house instead of defecating in the open
 baitool jile ke chauthia gaanv main lagbhag 238 makaan hai or har ghar main shauchalay he, iske baavjood badi sankhya main logakhule main shauchajane kii apni aadat chhod nahin paae the
 On this, the aware people of the village advised not to defecate in the open and told that this is the root of the disease, but no one listened
 itnaa hi nahin, kai ne to is muhim par virodh tak darj karaayaa
 The villagers formed a monitoring committee with youth and women to check this evil
 is samiti ne panchayat main ek niyantran kaksh banaaya
 The youth of the village keep an eye on those who defecate in the open space since morning
 is dauraan koi dikhataa he, to uski soochna mobile ke jariye niyantran kaksh ko dete hai
 Live commentary is then started on the loud speaker on the panchayat
 samiti se jude banrange bataate he ki khule main shouch jane vaale kii camentry kuch is tarah kii jaati he ki jo bhi vyakti aisa karata he, uski khabar puure gaanv ko ho jaati he
 Also the commentary is heard to the person concerned
 itnaa hi nahin, khule main shouch jane vaale logon kii tasviren whatsap par daalane kii bhi chetavanee di gai
 As a result of this, people started cutting down due to open defecation
 nigaraanee samiti kii sadsy radha bai bataati hai ki mahilaayein chhupakar aise logon par najar rakhti hai, jo khule main shouch ke liye jate hai
 Upon seeing this, she misses the control room
 uske baad vahaan se camentry shuru ho jaati he
 The result of this is that the habit of open defecation in the village has been curbed to a great extent, there are only a few people who still defecate in the open

 pichley do maheene se petrol or dijal mahangaa hone ke kaaran centre sarkaar ko baari aalochana jhelni padi he
 Despite the lowering of the price of crude oil in the international market, the rising prices of petrol and diesel are becoming a headache for the common man due to the huge tax being collected by the central and state government
 aise main aaj jiesti council kii meeting main centre sarkaar petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke daayre laane par charchaa karvaa sakati he
 How do you get so expensive when you reach the petrol / diesel oil refinery companies, one liter petrol to the government oil companies 28
 29 rupee prati litre or dijal 28
 87 per liter
 uske baad tel companiyaan apana margin jodakar dealron ko 30
 One liter petrol and diesel 30 for 81 paise
 66 rupee prati litre main bechati hai
 After that, 19 in this price of petrol
 48 rupee prati litre or dijal par 15
 An excise duty of Rs 33 per liter is added, which goes directly to the central government account
 uske baad petrol pump dilers ko petrol par 3
 55 per liter and 2 per liter on diesel
 49 rupee kamishan diya jaataa he
 Then the state government imposes VAT on it
 dilli main ek litre petrol paradilli sarkaar 27 fisadi kii dar se14
 54 rupees and diesel 16 per liter
 75 fisadi ke dar se waite vasuulati he jo 8
 41 levies VAT
 jiske baad dilli main graahakon ko ek litre petrol 68
 38 and diesel 56 per liter
 90 rupee main miltaa he
 That means one liter of petrol is only 26
 65 rupee main, lekin main tel companiyon kaa munafa, exise duty, waite, dilers kamishan lagbhag 41 rupee jodakar 68
 38 rupees and one liter diesel is ready for around 29 rupees, oil companies profit, excise duty, VAT, dealers commission about 56 rupees per liter after adding about 27 rupees
 90 rupee main upabhoktaaon ko dijal miltaa he
 That is, the central and state governments charge 120 per cent tax on the price of petrol and diesel per liter
 ab aise main centre or rajyon ke bich petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laane par baat ban gai or petrol par 28 fisadi jiesti lagaaya gaya, to petrol aapako keval 44-45 rupee prati litre or dijal keval 42 se 43 rupee prati litre main milegaa
 That is, the price of petrol will be reduced by about 26 rupees and the price of diesel by about 14 rupees
 par bada sawaal jiesti ke daayre main laane ke baad sarkaar ko rajasav main hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai kaise hogi
 Recently, the central government reduced the excise duty by about 2 rupees 50 paise in the price of petrol and 2 rupees 25 paise in the price of diesel, after which the central government is estimated to have a loss of annual revenue of 26 thousand crores
 isi tarah agar petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laayaa jayega to keval centre sarkaar 2 lakh karod kaa nuksaan hoga
 The loss to the state governments is different
 jab desh kii arthvyavastha har roj hichkole kha rahi ho to aise main centre sarkaar or rajya sarkarein itnaa bada revenue kaa nuksaan kaise uthaa paaengi
 For not bringing petroleum products into the GST, the Central Government has argued that this is being done to protect the states from harm
 gyaat ho ki abhipetrol / dijal par 51
 6 percent is taxed
 udhaaharan ke liye dilli main ek litre petrol par rajya sarkaar ne 27 pratishat waite laga rakhaa he
 Apart from this, the central government levies 42 percent excise duty
 haalanki centre ko milane vaale exise duty kaa bhi kuch hissaa dilli sarkaar ko miltaa he
 That is, Delhi government 24 per liter
 96 rupee paati he
 On the other hand, if the petrol / diesel is placed in the highest slab under the GST system, then 28 percent GST will be imposed
 aise main rajya sarkaar ko sirf 14 pratishat yani ek litre par 4
 Only Rs 19 will be available, which means 11 per liter
 19 rupee kii haani hogi
 Another way to compensate for this may be through cess, as is currently the case on large cars and suvs
 jiesti ke daayre main inhen laane se puure desh main petrol-dijal ke daam ek jaise ho jaaenge, lekin abhi kai rajya bada ghaataa uthaane ke mood main nahin hai

 When Sheila Dixit was in Delhi, private school children used to raise fees by feeding money to the officers, but the Aam Aadmi Party government has increased the fees from the checks of the parents by reducing the fees
 "kejariwal ne manch se khatter sarkaar se sawaal bhi puche or aadesh bhi die
 He alleged that the Khattar government in Haryana did not fix the schools, because all the money was spent on food
 khatter sahab ko aadesh dete hai ki, haryana main privet skool main fees badhanaa band karen
 If you do not believe Khattar sir, then the Aam Aadmi Party government is forming in 1 year, i will get you money with interest
 kejariwal ne kaha ki 70 saal main haryana main skool ke naam par kisi party ne vot nahin maanga

 Kejriwal said that i called Khattar Saheb to see the Mohalla clinic but he got scared
 phir main haryana kii dispenceri dekhne gaya to mujhe sadaken band karke roak liya gaya
 Kejriwal further said that this country belongs not to anyone's father but to the people
 haryana kii janata dilli aa jaae or hamaare skool, mohalla clinics or aspataal dekhen
 The mlas also got support
 Many mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party also reached Gurugram to support Kejriwal

 sibiesai board samet lagbhag har rajya ne 10veen kaksha ke parinaam kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 At the same time, as soon as the results were released, this question arises in the minds of students, which stream should be admitted
 10veen ke students ke liye sabase badi dikkat he
 If you are also struggling with this problem then follow these tips
 
 
 
 What do you want to be? First of all, set in your mind what your interest is about
 bhavishya main aap kya bananaa chaahate hai
 Choose arts, commerce or science stream accordingly
 arts main future nahin he-aksar zyaadaatar chaatr sochate hai ki commers or science main aage kaaphi scope he lekin arts main nahin he
 If you think the same, then tell me this is not the case at all
 aap stream chaahe koi bhi len, future har stream main he
 So to achieve your goal, which topic would be better to read, talk to your teachers or friends
 counslar se karen baat-agar aapako kuch bhi samaj nahin aa rahaa he to aap kariyar counslar kii madad le sakate hai
 Decide by talking to them which stream is best for your future
 josh main na len koi faisla -aisa aksar hota he ki ham apane doston or parivaar ko dikhaane ke liye josh main science or commers le baithte hai
 But later on you realize that you are not doing well in it
 isliye baad main pachhataane se acha he pehle hi sanbhal kar stream chune
 Do not care about people - if 90% marks are in your 10th and you can easily get science and commerce stream, but your interest is in arts, then choose arts stream regardless of people
 kyonki aap jaanate hai jitna behatar aap arts main kar paaenge utana science or commers stream main nahin kar paaenge

 asaram or narayan sai ke kaale karnaamon kii anginat paraten hai
 But how did Asaram's daughter Bharti get caught in the so-called black world of Asaram while preaching
 asaram kii sangat main chambal ke kitne daaku sudhare, iskaa to koi byoraa nahin he lekin har roj un ladakiyon kii nai fehrist jarur saamne aa rahi he jinka iljaam he ki asaram kii sangat ne unhen barbaad kar diya
 Bharti is also an important link in the kingdom of devotion to Asaram
 asaram par rape or yon shoshan kaa iljaam lagane se pehle log bharti ko ek kushal ojasvi vaktaa or pravachanon main apane gayan se logon ko mantra mugdh karne vaali aadhyatmik shakhsiyat ke rup main jaanate the
 But, times have changed
 asaram kaa mayajaal tutaa to unki beti bharti dwaara khadaa kiya gaya bhramjaal bhi darkane laga
 Former followers of his ashram, who accused Asaram and his son Narayan Sai of rape and sexual abuse, have made the world aware of Bharti's new identity
 bharti par aropakya he bharti kii nai pahchaan kuch ladakiyon ne ujagar kii he
 The victim girls told that she used to leave the girls sitting in the car and used to bring them
 kya bharti paheredari bhi karti thi? is sawaal ke jawaab main peedita ne kaha bharti ko jaise bolaa jaataa tha vaisaa wo karti thim, rukne ke liye bolaa jaae to rukati bhi thim
 What was the role of Lakshmi? In response to this question, the victim said, 'she used to send the girls from the ashram, Bapu used to tell them that today she has to send it, today she has to send it
 'ek purv sadhak amrit prajapati ne aarope lagaaya ki asaram bharti ko phone karata tha, wo gaadi se ladkiyaan laati thi
 That is, Bharti and her mother used to work hard in the alleged sex racket of Asaram and his son Narayan Sai
 donon unke liye ladakiyon ko taiyaar karti thim
 The mother-daughter duo worked to make the girls feel that Asaram and Narayan Sai were doing well for them
 amrit prajapati ne kaha, 'jab ladkiyaan bolti thim ki ganda kaam ho gaya to duusari ladkiyaan or lakshmi samaj jaati thi ki ye to teri kaaya kaa kalyaan ho gaya
 'when the sisters of Bharr Sundar have sensational accusations against Bharti herself, she is nowhere to be seen
 bataaya jaataa he ki wo faraar hai
 Of course, the court's decision on the whole matter is yet to come, but his absconding raises doubts among his devotees
 aakhir ek sachche vyakti ke paas aaropon kaa saamana karne kii himmat to honi hi chahie
 How Bharti stuck in Asaram's business, how did Bharti become involved with Asaram's business of devotion? What Bharti used to do was that at her behest, the girls agreed to go to Asaram and Narayan Sai, as some girls were accusing
 sattar ke dashak main asaram baapu ne kaa samrajya aadhyatm khadaa kiya tha
 Then his son Narayan Sai came to pursue the business of devotion to Asaram
 asaram ke kunbe ke liye shaayad itnaa hi kaaphi nahin tha
 Soon Asaram's daughter and Narayan Sai's sister Bharti also joined the empire of perceived spirituality
 asaram ke saadhakon ke bich bharti sriji ke naam se jaani jaati hai
 She would preach from place to place
 asaram ke bhakton kii maane to bharti kaa pravachan behad sammohit karne vaala hota tha
 Born on 15 December 1975, Bharti took initiation at the age of just 12
 phir chaudaa saal tak dhyaan or yoga kiya or lagane lageen darbar
 It is said that Bharti has studied till m
com
 lekin bharti kaa jivan hameshaa se aisa nahin tha
 Like ordinary women, they also tried to settle their household
 1997 main bharti kii shaadi doctor hemanth se hui thi
 Everything was going well, but Asaram is said to have interfered excessively in Bharti's family, so the relationship between Bharti and Hemant got tense and resulted in divorce
 hemanth is samay videsh main bataae jate hai
 Since Bharti's house was desolate due to Asaram, she came back to her father's shelter
 pehle unhen mahila ashramon kii kaman saunpi gai or phir pravachan kaa jimmaa
 However, seekers who have separated from Asaram and accuse Asaram tell more stories
 inke mutabik bharti kaa asli role satsang se ladakiyon kaa chunaav karnaa he
 These girls are then transported to Asaram
 logon ko bhakthi or aadhyatmik maarg par chalane ke liye prerit karne vaali mahila gandagi ke gahare dal-dal main dhansi hui thi or ab tak bhakthi ke sammohan main kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalaa? ye mahaj aarope hai yaa hakeekat, is par jaanch puri hone se pehle to kuch kahana mushkil he, lekin itnaa jarur kaha jaataa he ki aasthaa kii ek diwaar giri he
 The temple of Bharosa is broken, in which Bharti, along with Asaram and Narayan Sai, was also decorated as a goddess

 Uttar Pradesh Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said at the Backward Classes Conference on Thursday that at least one road in every district of the state will be named after former Bihar Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur
 yogi sarkaar ke is kadam ke raajnneetik myne nikaale jane lage hai

 He is known in the OBC community as the biggest messiah of social justice in Bihar
 upi main sadak ko karpuri thakur ke naam se rakhane kaa silsilaa bhi shuru ho gaya he
 a road in Phulpur district of the state has been named after Karpoori Thakur
 upi kii jilon main sadakon ko chinhit karne kaa kaam shuru ho gaya he
 It is believed that at least one road in every district of the state will be named after Karpoori Thakur within a month
 keshav maury ne kaha ki vipakshi partiyaan modi ko rokane kii naakaam koshish kar rahi hai
 The poor, dalits, backward, deprived, farmers, youth of the country all know that Narendra Modi as Prime Minister is working for the poor with integrity
 bataa den ki karpuri thakur ne hi saal1978 main biharmen sabase pehle sarkari naukariyon main 26 pratishat aarakshan lagu kiya tha
 Of this, 12 percent was reserved for the backward
 8 pratishat pichhadon ke liye
 If Bihar CM Nitish Kumar still implements reservation, then more reservations are given to the backward and less to the backward
 isi formule ke jariye nitish kumaar bihar kii satta par kabiz hai
 There is a panic within the BJP about the SP and BSP grand alliance
 pichley kuch dinon se isaki sugabugahat se hi bijepi netaaon main khalabali machi hui he
 The BJP knows that it is with the upper castes, but it is not possible to return to power only with the help of upper caste votes
 upi main obisi bijepi ke kor voters rahe hai
 If SP and BSP combine, there will be a dent in this category
 aise main bijepi karpuri thakur jaise un tamaam netaaon ke naam ko bhunaane main jute gai he, jise espi or bispi ne apane shasankaal main bhula diya tha
 It is believed that bjp's image will be better in the backward class
 keshav prasad maury ko obisi jaateey sammelan kii jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 Caste-wise conference of all backward castes has started in Uttar Pradesh
 party adhyaksh amit shah ke is farmaan ke baad bijepi jativaar meeting karne main juty he
 In the last few days, in Lucknow, the BJP has held a conference of extremely backward castes like Prajapati i

 is jeet ke saath mejabaan team ne paanch maichon kii shrunkhlaa main 1-0 kii badhat hasil kar lee he
 India started poorly chasing a target of 293 runs, but Kohli's century and Shikhar Dhawan's 32 and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's 40 runs raised hopes of victory for him

 India could not afford to open the account of Ravindra Jadeja (0)

 Pakistan has failed to finalize the agreement on the purchase of eight F-16 fighters from the US due to the financial dispute
 ek media report main yah jaankaree di gai he
 The Pakistan government was required to provide an acceptance letter by May 24 for the purchase of Inladaku aircraft, but 'dawn News' reported that the document was not released, which ended the offer period
 'abhi samaapt nahin hui he antim seemaa'ek rajanyik sutara ke hawaale se akhbaar ne bataaya, 'pakistan ne rashtriya kosh se iskaa purna vitt poshan nahin karne kaa faisla kiya, jisase bikri kii sharte ab samaapt ho gai hai
 However, Pakistan's Ambassador to the US, Jalil Abbas Jilani told the newspaper that the last border is not yet over
 70 karod dollar kaa saudabata den ki shuruyaat main aathyan-16c / d block 52 bahuuddeshshi ladaaku vimaanon kii kharid ke liye 70 karod dollar ke saude ke kuch hisse ko america videshi sainya vitt poshan kaarykram ke tahat vittiya samarthan diya janaa tha, lekin congress ne is bikri main riyaayat dene se inkaar kar diya
 This is because of the denial
 The Congress denied the financial concession to the deal on the grounds that Pakistan had done little to end the refugees of the infamous Haqqani terrorist group on its soil
 saath hi congress ko islamabad ke parmaanu kaarykram ko lekar bhi ashanka thi

 com / rri9zemmxl Two events will change the direction of privacy and data security this year
 yahaan tak ki hindustan main bhi aisa hoga, jahaan niztaa zyaadaatar logon ke liye anjaan lafj he or jahaan 2020 tak ham smartphone par internet kaa istemaal karne vaale 30 karod nae logon kaa online swaagat kar rahe honge, jo data suraksha ke maamle main pehle 30 karod logon se bhi zyada kamjor honge
 The second of these two incidents will be the one in which Europe implements the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on 25 May
 jidipiar kaa makasad nijee data kaa niyantran logon ko saunpna he—isamen ek samaan niyam-kaayade hai jo europea sangh ke 28 sadsy deshon ke liye badhyakaari hai ye us duniya ke liye—or bharat ke liye bhi—seekhney ke lihaaj se ahm honge jahaan philhal niztaa se jude koi kaayade-kanoon nahin hai
 And the first incident? Cambridge Analytica (CA) was busted last month for stealing personal data of 5 crore Facebook users in the US to influence the opinion of voters
 bataaya jaataa he ki sie hindustan main bhi sakriy thi or 2019 ke aam chunaavon ke liye kathith taur par siyaasi partiyon ke saath baatcheet kar rahi thi
 It is a big thing that ca's Bhanda erupt
 soshal media kii diggaj companiyon ke naitik mandandon ko lekar duniya bhar main jo shor-sharaaba machaa he or jo saarvajanik charchaa shuru hui he, vah abhootpurv he
 Demands for more online consumer protection and privacy have been raised by activists, lawmakers and governments
 iskaa asar data suraksha (jis par ek sarkari samiti bana di gai he) ko lekar hindustan ke bahes-mubaahison par bhi padana chahie
 The Supreme Court last August declared privacy a fundamental right and its five-judge constitutional bench is hearing petitions challenging the validity of Aadhaar for privacy and other reasons
 kya niztaa hindustaniyon ke liye ahm he? aaie, is sawaal kaa sandarbh talashte hai
 Our first 300 million people, who used broadband on mobile, were educated and had enough time to gain access to the use of digital medium during the last three years
 (tiri ne bataaya he ki janvari ke aakhir tak 37
 There were 8 crore broadband users of which 95 percent used it on mobile)
 magar un agle 30 karod logon kaa kya, jo 2020 tak online ho jaaenge or internet yugers kii taadaad 73 karod se upar pahunchaa denge? ve saamaajik-aarthik pyramid kii nichali paaydaanon ke log hai jinaki digital sakshartaa shunya he
 Many of them are illiterate
 takreeban anpadh dihadi mazdooreen nakadi kaa istemaal karti he, use ginati or bhugtan karti he
 It has now been asked to go digital and the ease of cash transactions has suddenly been replaced by a dozen digital steps
 aisa vah keval tabhi kar sakati he jab interphes vaaki aasaan, saral-sahaj or har jagah ek sareekha ho (abhi hamaare atm tak to aise nahin hue) or logon kaa tajurba nakadi jaisaa hi ho—jald, aasaan or mahfuj
 If a telecaller asks for personal data from her, she will tell it all
 agar koi utawala sarkari afasar usase uskaa pin maangata he or scinar par ungali rakhane ko kahata he to vah vaisaa hi karegi
 The shock of the "CA episode" has struck us — that data breaches are disastrous even without tampering with consumer money
 loktantr main mahaj uski buniyaad yani chunaav prakriya ko daanv par lagaakar data ke saath kis kadar nuksaan pahunchaaya ja saktaa he
 It has also given a deep push to Facebook, which has been overshadowed by the Federal Trade Commission investigation
 use apane yujar data protection or "athoraiced ap'' ke niyamon ko anivaary taur par sakht bananaa padegaa or iskaa asar hindustan par bhi padegaa, jo uske agle ek arab yujar ke liye sabase ahm bazaaron main se ek he
 Be it Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha or BJP Parliamentary Party meeting, you would have seen Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the first line
 lekin dilli main bijepi saansadon ke prashikshan shivi main ek ajeeb najaara dikhaa jahaan pradhanmantri narendra modi saansadon ke bich peeche kii line main ek kursi par baithe dikhaai die
 a two-day training program of BJP mps is currently underway in Delhi
 is kaarykram main bijepi ke sabhi saansadon kii upasthiti anivaary he
 This program is named 'practice class'
 is kaarykram ko pradhanmantri narendra modi, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or raksha mantri rajnath singh jaise varisht netaa sambodhit karenge
 mps are being taught political tricks in this program in Parliament Library Building
 koi yun hin jan jan kaa pyaara nahin ho jaataa,koi aise hi puri duniya main nahin chaa jaataa,koi yun hin narendra modi nahin ban jaataa,aam saansad kii tarah peeche jaakar baithne kaa hriday hona chahieaisa aaj hua abhyaas varg main
 So much so that we have to stay away from ego

 narendra modi se aage kii qatari main dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari baithe dikhe
 Other leaders, including some women mps, were seen sitting in the back row with Prime Minister Modi
 bijepi kii is baithak main saarvajanik jivan main jan pratinidhiyon ko anushaasan or aacharan kii bhi sikh di ja rahi he
 The importance of this meeting can be gauged from the fact that all the mps have been asked to be present in it
 ravivaar shaam pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saansadon ko sambodhit karenge
 With this, this meeting will end

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi held an all-party meeting on Wednesday to discuss one nation one election, but Election Commission sources have said that the idea is not possible at the moment
 ek purv mukhya nirvachan ayukta ne bhi kaha ki yah prastaav jitna uchit he, utana hi anuchit bhi he
 a top source of the Election Commission said that had this idea been possible, the Commission would have held the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections together this year
 nirvachan ayog ne loksabhaa chunaav saat charnon main karaae the, jo 11 april se shuru hua tha or 19 may tak chalaa tha
 The election results were declared on 23 May
 sutron ne yah bhi kaha ki ekasaath chunaav karaane main kanoon-vyavastha kaa mudda bahut chunauteepurn ho saktaa he, kyonki kendriya ardhsainik balon kii sankhya simit he
 He also said that there are more than 90 crore voters in the country and preparing for elections simultaneously is a very difficult task at the moment
 bataa den ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek desh ek chunaav ke mudde par sarvadaleey baithak bulaai
 Many parties joined it and many political parties boycotted it
 vahiin baithak khatm hone ke baad raksha mantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki ek raashtra ek chunaav ke mudde ke vibhinn pahaluon par gaur karne ke liye ek cameti kaa gathan kiya jayega
 Rajnath Singh said that the committee will be formed after talking to the people concerned
 us cameti ke liye samay seemaa nirdhaarit kii jaaegi
 Rajnath Singh said that most parties supported the one country one election, only the Left leaders expressed some apprehension on the issue and asked how it would happen
 yah baithak paanch sutri agenda par thi
 Issues like increasing the functioning of the House, one country one election, 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi

 com / aiyfka2c5j— Josh Einiger (@josheiniger7)july 3, 2016 Delhi's air quality remained grim for the second consecutive day on Thursday, forcing the Environmental Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) to impose a 24-hour ban on the entry of trucks into the national capital
 ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara niyukt ipisie ne sambandhit prashasan ko nirdesh diya ki shahar main gambhir pradooshan ke chalate trakon ko shuukravaar gyaarah baje raat se shanivaar gyaarah baje raat tak dilli main pravesh kii ijaajat nahin hogi

 This decision of EPCA has been taken in the light of severe air quality in the national capital
 is sijan main aisa duusari baar hoga ki trakon ke pravesh par pabandi lagaayi jaaegi
 Earlier this was done from November 1 to November 12 when the air quality deteriorated significantly
 kendriya pradooshan niyantran board ke aankade ke anusaar shahar main sampurna vaayu gunvattta suchakanka 443 rahaa jo gambhir shrenee main aata he

 isse pehle congress ne pulavama hamale ko lekar modi sarkaar se paanch sawaal puche the
 The Congress had asked why the lives of our brave soldiers were put in jeopardy by ignoring the information about a possible attack by the Jammu and Kashmir Police? The Modi government cannot escape its accountability

 com / ydten8ggqx— Congress (@incindia) February 21, 2019 DS Hoodabata was against the promotion of the surgical strike, DS Hooda had strongly criticized the much publicity of the surgical strike
 unhone kaha tha ki sargical strike jaruri tha or ham logon ne ise kiya
 i don't think it should be much publicized
 sargical strike se yah samajhnaa ki ab aatank khatm ho gaya yaa pakistan baj aa jayega, yah galat he
 Idea has introduced a new plan for its prepaid customers
 is plan kii keemat 189 rupee rakhi gai he
 However, this plan has been introduced only for limited users
 saath hi ye plan keval chuninda cirkilon main hi uplabdh karaayaa jayega
 In this plan of Rs 189, the company will give 2GB 2G / 3G / 4G data, unlimited voice calls and 100SMS per day
 sabase khaas baat ye he ki idia apane is plan main graahakon ko 56 dinon kii validity de rahi he
 It can be believed that the company has launched this plan keeping in mind the more calling customers
 lekin is plan main colling main hi rojaanaa or hafte ke hisaab se minuton kii baadhyataa bhi tay kii gai he
 Let us tell you that once the 2GB of data being received in this plan is over, customers will have to pay with talk time balance
 yahaan colling ko lekar rojaanaa 250 minute or pratihafte 1000 minute kii baadhyataa rahegi
 Apart from this, let us also tell you that during 56 days validity, users can call only 100 unique numbers
 telecom tok kii report ke mutabik philhal ye 56 dinon kii validity vaala sabase sasta preeped plan he or aisa hi ek plan vodaphone ke paas bhi he
 The price of Vodafone plan is also Rs 189
 maaloom ho ki vodaphone or idia marjar ke baad se ek company ban gayi hai
 Now if you compare this plan with Jio's Rs 199 prepaid plan, then the company gives 2GB data, unlimited voice calls and 100SMS per day
 haalanki is plan kii validity maatr 28 dinon kii he
 That is, in terms of benefits, Jio's plan is ahead of Idea, but the validity of Idea's plan is twice that of Jio

 siesake or bhartiya team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni shrinivasana kii company india cements ke upaadhyaksh hai
 His name has also been included in the scandal
 police kii report ke anusaar, ve is baat ke liye raji ho gaye the ki ipiel main chennai kii team rajasthan royles ke khilaaf 130-140 ran banaaegi
 His team scored 141 runs
 team match haar gai
 In general, the world will sigh and say that this is another example of weak betting laws and a culture of favoritism in India, which is spoiling the name of cricket
 lekin ve chintit hai kyonki shrinivasana ab isisi kaa swaroop badalakar khel par kabiz ho gaye hai
 He has also joined England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and Cricket Australia (CA) in this power-grabbing game
 isisi ke is badale hue swaroop main garib pehle se zyada garib or amiron ke pehle se zyada amir hone ke asaar hai
 What about its good governance? All decisions in its new regime will be in the hands of BCCI, ECB and CA
 baaki unke peeche rahenge
 The BCCI has shown that cricket means corruption, and has proved it from Colombo to the Caribbean and Lords to Lahore
 in email par gaur karne se bisisiai main jhankane kaa mauka miltaa he or pataa chalata he ki uske andar kitna andhera he
 These matches show how powerful a person Srinivasan is
 ye email bisisiai main majboot dhaanche ke abhaav ko dikhaate hai jabaki safal sanghathan kii sthapana ke liye dhaanche main majbootee jaruri he
 On 8 May 2013, Srinivasan wrote a letter to ICC President Alan Isaac
 isamen unhone isisi cricket cameti main khiladinnon ke pratinidhi ke taur par federation of international cricketrs association ke adhyaksh tim me kii jagah lakshmana shivaramkrishnan ke chunaav ke masale par khulkar samarthan na dene par paroksh rup se dhamkaaya
 Employees of Shivaram India Cements are said to be
 shrinivasana ne likhaa tha, ‘‘exysie ke media main abhiyaan ko lekar isisi management kii sahanubhuti or chuppi se mujhe fark nahin padataa lekin ham ise isisi management ke saath apane sambandhon main ek nirnaayak mode jarur maanenge
 The FICA kept openly making false allegations and the ICC kept watching silently, this is not our stand
 samay aane par ham iskaa sahi jawaab denge
 The FICA had demanded an inquiry into this election and claimed that the captains of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe were asked to vote in favor of Sivaramakrishnan in the re-election after May was elected
 aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki bisisiai ne apane paise kii takat ke dam par in deshon ke board ko apane haq main vot dene ke liye majaboor kiya
 All this makes sense of the exchange of emails between Dhoni and icc's Jeff Allardyce
 dhoni isse chidhe hue the ki unhen dobaaraa vot dena padegaa
 The email stated, "L
 shivaramkrishnan chune gaye hai, lekin aisa kaise hua ki pichhali mail se duusare daavedaar srilanka ke cricketer kumaar sangakaara kaa naam chun liya gaya, shiva kaa nahin
 Dhoni is close to Srinivasan, he may have been following orders
 agar isse shrinivasana kii takat kaa pataa chalata he, to april, 2013 kii do email unke apane sanghathan ke niyamon ke prati asammaan jaahir karti hai
 On April 15, Peter Griffith of IMG, who helped run the IPL, wrote to BCCI Secretary Sanjay Jagdale that the commission should be constituted to hear the complaint under the IPL 2013 governing rules
 in niyamon ke anusaar, bisisiai ke sachiv ko sadsy chunane kaa adhikaar he, lekin paanch din baad unhen tamilnadu cricket association ke sachiv kaashi vishvanathan kii email mili, jisamen likhaa thah ‘‘main adhyaksh kii taraf se aapako likhe sandesh kii nakal bhej rahaa huh ‘‘sanjay, rajeev shukla, ajay shirke, or ravishastri shikaayat kii sunwaayee karenge
 N
 shrinivasana
 Sanjay Jagdale and Shirke resigned on May 31 to protest the board's way of dealing with the controversy
 ab jagadale kaa kahana he ki bisisiai ke sanchaalan ko lekar unhen ‘‘koi pareshaani’’ nahin
 Another example of neglect of officials is that IPL Chief Financial Officer Prasanna Kannan, an employee of India Cements, informed Jagdale about the appointments for the domestic series with England and Pakistan on April 4, 2013, while both these series were in 2012
 It was late and early 2013
 sachiv ye niyuktiyaan na kare, yah galat he
 This raises the question as to what it has to do with the IPL officer
 yahaan yah bataanaa jaruri hoga ki mudgal ayog ke saath sahyog karne main kannan ne shrinivasana kii madad kii thi
 The spot-fixing controversy and the bcci's disregard for proper rules have kept fans away from IPL
 2008 main pehle sanskaran ke baad se uski reating 4
 8 to 2 9 pratishat par aa gai he
 "such controversies and administrative laxity have pushed ipl's brand value to a billion dollars," says Unni Krishnan, global strategy director at London-based brand valuation consultancy Brand Finance
 ’’cricket jagat ke liye yah chintaa kii baat he ki batue kii chaabi bisisiai or shrinivasana ke haath main he
 The final position paper prepared by Srinivasan's secretary will ensure that the condition of every member is going to be slim except for England, Australia and India
 isisi or bisisiai donon ke adhyaksh rah chuke aai
 s
 bindra kaa kahana he, ‘‘shrinivasana jaanate the ki ve sab kuch apni mutthi main kar sakate hai
 He said that if Aaron Lorgat should not run the South African board, Lorgat was suspended
 unhone kaha ki diares nahin chalegaa, to nahin chalaa
 They run the ICC
 mere samay main jagmohan daalamia godfadar the or shrinivasana unke pichhalggu the
 But now they are more dangerous because they have more resources
 unhone mujhase kaha tha ki ve aglaa daalamia bananaa chaahate hai

 ADG Kailash Makwana said that when cross-checking was done by the Superintendent of Police of the respective districts, all the cases were found to be fake
 baccha chor gang jaisi koi bhi baat saamne nahin ai
 Police has informed in different groups that all things are fake and there is no truth in such incidents

 The administration and police have been alerted in all districts to keep an eye on social media and promptly refute the rumors, so that incidents like mob lynching do not occur

 India responds to the overbearing pakistan-pakistan offer after 370 months, India said - Pakistan should leave the path of terror first, will India and Pakistan once again sit at the negotiating table? It is being speculated that because first Pakistan and soon after that the Foreign Minister of India has indicated towards a possible dialogue
 jammu-kashmir se anuchhed-370 hatane ke baad pehle 25 din tak to pakistan ne khub pintara dikhaaya
 Threatened war
 atom bam kaa dam dikhaaya
 Appealed to the Islamic countries of the world
 iske alaava wo sab kuch kiya jo wo kar saktaa tha
 But Pakistan did not get anything strong from anywhere
 khastahal arthvyavastha se jujh rahaa pakistan maheenaa guzarate-guzarate ek baar phir se 'baatcheet' kii baat karne laga he
 Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said on Saturday that Pakistan is ready for a conditional dialogue with India
 kuraishi ne kaha ki pakistan hameshaa se baatcheet ke jariye bharat ke saath maujuuda muddon ko hal karnaa chahta he or agar koi desh madhyasthata karegaa to pakistan uskaa bhi swaagat karegaa
 Qureshi said that Pakistan is ready for talks, but it will be possible only when India is equally interested in it
 baatcheet ke liye shart rakhte hue kuraishi ne kaha ki bharat ko pehle jammu-kashmir se paabandiyaan hataani chahie saath hi najarband kiye gaye kashmiri netaaon ko bhi chhod dena chahie
 India did not ignore this offer from Pakistan and gave a cautious response
 bharat ke videsh mantri ne nai dilli kaa paksh rakhte hue kaha ki bharat pakistan se anya lambit muddon par aatank or hinsa se mukt vaataavaran main baat karne ko taiyaar he
 Foreign Minister s Jaishankar made this statement in Brussels
 european union ke kamishnar se baatcheet main es jaishankar ne kaha, "aatank or hinsa mukt vaataavaran main bharat, pakistan ke saath anya muddon par baatcheet ke liye taiyaar he
 "underlined India's openness to discuss other outstanding issues bilaterally with Pakistan in an atmosphere free of terror and violence
" — Dr
 S
 Jaishankar (@drsjaishankar)august 30, 2019digar he ki bharat ne pakistan ke saath baatcheet kii jo peshkash kii he usamen saaf kaha gaya he ki bharat pakistan ke saath 'anya' muddon par 'aatank or hinsa' se mukt vaataavaran main baat karnaa chahta he
 That is, India has made it clear that there is no scope for negotiation on Article 370
 ab vaarta ko lekar pakistan kii gambhirtha kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya jayega ki uskaa aglaa kadam kya hoga? kya pakistan ke hukmran anuchhed-370 se itar anya muddon par baat karnaa chahenge?haalanki pakistan ke pradhanmantri karyaalay se aisa koi sanket nahin mil rahaa he
 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan wanted to show the Propaganda of the Atom bomb in front of the world the same day
 imran ne kaha tha ki kashmir mudde par atomi takat se las do padosi sidhe takaraav kii sthiti main aa gaye hai
 For every drowning leader in the BJP, if there is any support for the straws, then only the RSS
 party kaa bada netaa ho, mukhyamantri ho yaa phir adhyaksh sankat kii ghadi main sangh-sangh hi japta he
 At present, a similar situation is in the state of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 uski vajah raajnneetik nahin balki shubh-ashubh shakun- apshakun se judy manyata he
 It is directly related to Ujjain Simhastha Kumbh
 sinhasth se judaa adbhut sanyogsinhasth kumbhake saath ek khaas kism kaa sanyog judaa hua he jo is pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke liye shubh nahin hota
 Whispers continue to run in the political corridors so that the Chief Minister who was there during Simhastha lost his chair
 chaahe congressi mukhyamantri rahe ho yaa bijepi ke sinhasth main mukhiya ko dobaaraa shipra main dubkee lagane kaa mauka nahin mila
 The Chief Minister has been making every effort to punish Shivraj Singh in front of the Sangh for not blaming the Shiv Sena Roadmap of the Sangh on the ground
 kumbh se pehle shivaraj ne nagpur jaakar mohan bhagwat se mulaakaat kii
 Shivraj, who gave the roadmap for the Kumbh, implemented it as it is
 antarrashtriya vichaar mahakumbh main bhartiya paramparaon or jeene kii kala kii theme ko saamne laana sangh kaa pehla agenda tha jise safal banane kaa bidaa shivaraj ne uthaaya
 Shivraj achieved the praise of the sangh-bjp with the harmony bathing and connecting the saints with him was also part of this which the Sangh wanted to fulfill in every situation
 in kaaryakramon main koi chook naa rah jaae isaki jimmedaari khud shivaraj ne sanbhali or ujjain main hi deraa jamaa liya
 The result was that the Sangh patted Shivraj and Mohan Bhagwat and Amit Shah praised him from the stage
 is sabase kya shivaraj apshakun kaa myth tod paaenge, ye sawaal philhal netaa ho yaa adhikari sabaki jubaan par he
 Simhasthasal came to occupy the cm's chair in 1980 when Sundar Lal Patwa was the Chief Minister in the Janata Party government, after Simhastha, his government went away
 1992 ke sinhasth main bhi patwa mukhyamantri the, lekin sinhasth ke chah maah baad hi madhyapradesh main raashtrapati shashan lagu ho gaya or unki sarkaar barkhaast kar di gai
 Digvijay Singh started preparations for the 2004 Ksinstha but he was knocked out in the election and Uma Bharti became the Chief Minister
 uma ne sinhasth puraa to karavaaya lekin unhen bhi bich main hi pad chhodna padaa
 Great cricket was seen in the final match of World Cup 2019 played on Sunday

 haar ke baad newjiland ke khilaadi jimi nishaam ne ek twit kiya jisamen unhone bacchon se apil karte hue likhaa ki khel ko kabhi mat chunanaa

 In fact, even after the defeat, the way he appeared smiling and with a calm temperament, he won the hearts of social media users
 gauratlab he ki newjiland ne super over main jaakar world cap ganvaa diya
 New Zealand needed 16 runs in the super over and only Jimmy Nisham came in to bat
 unke saath martin gaptil maidan par utre the
 But the New Zealand team could only score 15 runs and the England team won on the basis of boundary
 isisi ke niyamon ke hisaab se mili england kii jeet par har kisi ne sawaal khadey kiye hai

 or usne ek nahin balki do baar piyush par jaanaleva hamale kiye
 Thankfully, Piyush was only injured in these attacks
 paanch saal ke ek tarfaa pyaar ne vivek agarwal ko is jode kaa jaani dushman bana diya

 bedi ji aapaki shabdaawalee main agar kaha jaye to raajnneeti degree se nahin, 3 des (3ds) se aadmi sikhta he
 'dhake', 'cheat' and 'dar Badar ki Thokre'
 lagata he aapke andolan or dharna classmet aravind kejariwal raajnneeti ke bare main ab kaaphi kuch sikh gaye hai
 How successful Kejriwal will be, it will be known only with the results on February 10, but the intelligence with which he is making the strategy does not make him think that he will ever forget to take political decisions in a huff
 gaur karte hai - 1) Sting: When the Aam Aadmi Party did the sting of BJP leaders on the purchase and sale of mlas, BJP could not bear the 'risk' of manipulating the government
 is tarah kejariwal ne dobaaraa chunaav karawaaye jane kii awaz ko zindaa rakhaa or aakhirkaar chunaav ho rahe hai
 2) Jagdish Mukhi Vs Kejriwal: As soon as the Assembly was dissolved, from the very next day, autos started appearing in Delhi, behind which Delhiites were asked who you want to see the Chief Minister - Kejriwal or Jagdish Mukhi
 bhaajapa ne apana mukhyamantri ummidavaar ghoshit bhi nahin kiya tha, lekin kejariwal kii mukhi se tulana main kejariwal kaa upar chadhana to tay tha
 3) Satish Upadhyay: Last year, Kejriwal defeated Vijay Goel of BJP before the election by electrocution
 vijay goyal ke manch se hi unhone janata ko bijli ke liye rajya sarkaar or chuppi saadhe rakhane ke liye bhaajapa ko doshi tehraaya or goyal dekhte rah gaye
 After coming to power, they started the audit of electricity companies and also reduced public bills with subsidies
 is baar phir se bhaajapa ke satish upaadhyaay ke bijli companiyon se santh-ganth ko ujagar kar bhaajapa ko pehla jhatka diya or karant kuch aisa laga ki upaadhyaay ko is baar tikat bhi naseeb nahin hua
 4) Debate with Kiran: The BJP tried to cover Kiran Bedi's entry on the allegations against Satish Upadhyay and was successful even for a day when all the media attention was focused on Bedi
 lekin agle hi din kejariwal ne kiran bedi kaa swaagat kiya or mukhyamantri kii ummidavaari lete hi unase apane saath bahes main do-do haath karne ko kaha jisase bedi ji abhi tak bhaagti hi dikh raheen hai
 Since then, the debate on media and social media is that both of them should have a debate
 5) mafalaraman : kejariwal ne apni middle class pahchaan ko is chunaav main bhi nahin choda jabaki soshal media par unka is mafalar or khaansee kii vajah se khub mazaaq bana
 They still wear their muffler in the same style
 6) maafi or mehnat : kejariwal apane istife dene kaa paksh logon ko nahin samajha paye, lekin unhone janata kii bhaavana samajhi or maafi maang kar aage bade
 As a result of his door-to-door campaigning, the results of the Aam Aadmi Party were good in the surveys shown on TV and the BJP woke up with a jolt from its 'lahariya' sleep
 7) purv vidhansabha kshetra se namakan bharaa - kejariwal ne is baar bina koi chunauti die apni purv vidhansabha seat se hi namakan bharne kaa man banaaya or intazaar kiya ki bhaajapa bedi ko kahaan se chunaav ladavaayegi
 The BJP also fielded Kiran Bedi in its safest seat from where Harshvardhan has been winning for the last five elections
 haalanki bhaajapa ke itane 'baikfoot' par hone kii ummid shaayad hi kisi ne kii hogi
 Because it is obvious that the BJP brought Kiran against Kejriwal, but does not want to let him face it face to face in the assembly seat
 8) road sho : namakan bharne nikle kejariwal kaa road sho baaki donon partiyon se kahin bad kar tha
 The media also had to name it Shakti Demonstration
 isse ye bhi saafe ho jaataa he ki kejariwal ne apane sanghathan par kaam kiya he
 Even though some leaders left the party citing lack of democracy, Kejriwal has kept his workers tied
 kaaryakarta ke isi utsaah kii kami kiran bedi ke road sho main saafe jhalki
 In a way, this two-and-a-half-year-old party has blown the sleep of the old parties that now the parties have to compromise their 'party principles' and the honest people have to be fielded
