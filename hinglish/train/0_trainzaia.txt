 nepal main bhartiya channelon ke prasaaran par roak lagaae jane ke baad sarkaar ne sakht rukh apanaaya to ab cabel operataron ne prasaaran shuru kar diya he
 It may be noted that after the constitution came into force, the information ministry of the government, alarmed by the movement of the Madheshis, called for a reply from the Cable Operators Association
 nepal sarkaar neprasaran bandakarne ko gaiyr kanoonee tehraate hue operataron se mangalvaar ko 24 ghante ke bheetar spashtikaran maanga tha
 Actually Madheshi has been opposing it since the new constitution was implemented in Nepal
 bharat nenepal se samvidhan main sanshodhanakarne ko kaha, jise nepal ne na sirf thukraa diya balki apni samprabhutaa par hamalaa mana
 The movement of Madheshis continues in opposition to the constitution
 alam yah he ki nepal ke kai hisson main jaruri saamaan nahin pahunch paa rahaa
 Nepal alleges that India is doing economic blockade
 nakebandi se khafa pahari janata ne mangalvaar ko kathmandu main bharat virdohi naare lagaae or virodh main channel bain kar die
 'those who are doing news plant will come to us and will eat shoes
 ' bharat ke grih rajya mantri kiren rijiju kaa yah bayaan he
 a person in a constitutional office is expected to have a decent language
 shaleen na bhi ho to kam se kam loktantric ho
 Ordinary people also consciously and unconsciously talk about kicking shoes, because caste and feudal linguistic rites are mixed in all of us
 hona yah chahie ki aise sanskaron se mukti paane ke liye sabhi jivan bhar abhyaas karte rahen
 But when you sit in a ministerial position and challenge someone that if we come here and eat a shoe, then it should be specially taken notice, because then it is also a threat
 baaki bharat kaa to nahin kah saktaa lekin uttar bhartiya bhashaai sanskaar se aane ke kaaran bataa saktaa hum ki juuta maarna, juuta khilaanaa niyahat hi saamanti or jativaadee gurur kaa shabd he
 It is used against the poor and poor in the caste structure
 phir iskaa istemaal aapas main bhi ek-duusare se taqatvar hone kaa ahsaas dilaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 But how did these elements come in the language of a minister coming from the Northeast
 grih rajya mantri kiren rijiju us mantralay main rajnath singh kaa haath bantaate hai, jiskaa kaam he ki bharat kii aatanrik suraksha vyavastha kaa sanchaalan karnaa
 The ministry is also a top apex ministry from the Indian Police Force to the semi-security forces
 chaahe jaisi chhavi ho lekin police hamaare mohalle main sanvaidhanik abhibhavak he
 At least we can question the police why she is not operating according to the constitution and rules
 zaahir he yah sawaal ham rajyon main mukhyamantri or police pramukh se karenge or centre main kendriya grahamantri or grih rajya mantri se karenge ki police kii vyavastha kyon karaab he
 Now the colleague of the head of this ministry should not trust the police and say that if the people who are doing the news plant come to us, then if they will eat the shoe then what does it mean? akhir rijiju kaa jo 'hamaare yahaan he' kya wo samvidhan vyavastha se sarvocch he jahaan aapatti hone par kanoon se nahin juuton se nipataara kiya jaataa he
 The Minister of State for Home may have objected to the news of 'indian Express', but if he had relied on his ministry, he would have filed the case
 niyamon kii baat karte
 Do not invite shoes to feed
 mantri ji ke is vaakya se do samasyaayein hai
 They should refrain from using feudal and caste terms while holding a constitutional post

 'we will come here to eat shoes', speaking is not of the minister, but the grandfather's type is heard
 kya mantri is khabar kii pratikriya main kisi bheed ko uksaa rahe hai jo unke yahaan kii he, jahaan jane par juute padenge
 Governments of the world, anti-leaders make news plants
 mantri khud news plant karaate hai

 Planted news is not necessarily wrong, but if not checked properly it can be wrong
 kaayade se isaki shikaayat press council of india main ho sakati he yaa phir akhbaar ke sampadak ko kii ja sakati he, lekin sawaal poochne par juuta khilaane kii baat kya aapako thik lagi
 Is the Minister telling the journalist of 'indian Express' that if he goes here, he will feed the shoe or he is saying that who is the source of the news
 to kya mantri rijiju ko pataa he ki yah khabar koun plant karvaa rahaa he
 Even if you know, is his method a shoe
 yah baat sirf kiren rijiju ke liye nahin, balki khud mere liye, ham sabake liye he ki saamanti or jatigat shabdon se rozaana mukti kaa shram karen

 Speaking of rules
 juuta khilaane ke liye aamantrit nahin karte
 The minister has two problems with this sentence

 Such a mistake happens to us all, it is better that we realize this mistake

 Is the minister provoking a crowd in response to the news that he has here, where shoes will go when he goes
 duniya kii sarkarein, virdohi netaa news plant karaate hai
 The minister himself runs a news plant
 sutara bhi news plant karaate hai
 Any news can easily be declared a plant
 zaruri nahin ki plant kiya hua news galat hi ho, magar thik se check na karen to galat ho saktaa he
 Normally, it can be complained to the Press Council of India or to the editor of a newspaper, but when asked the question, did you feel right about feeding the shoe
 kya mantri ji 'indian express' ke patrkaar ko kah rahe hai ki unke yahaan gaya to juuta khilaayenge yaa use kah rahe hai ki jo news kaa sorce he
 So does Minister Rijiju know who is getting this news plant? agar pataa he to bhi kya uskaa tarika juuta he
 It is not only for Kiren Rijiju, but for me, myself, for all of us to work daily for liberation from feudal and caste-based words
 ummid karata hum ki mantri ji afsos zaahir karenge

 aaj kii is kadi main ham aapako bataa rahe hai wo kissa jabamadhavrao sindhiyaphone aane kaa intjaar karte rahe or vah shaks mukhyamantri ban gaya jo vidhayak nahin tha
 
 
 The story of Digvijay Singh becoming the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh is interesting
 kaha jaataa he kidigvijay singhmukhyamantri ban gaye or madhavrao sindhiya dilli main helicopter taiyaar kar phone aane kaa intjaar karte rahe
 Actually, Madhya Pradesh came under President's rule after the Babri Masjid demolition
 digvijay singh us samay pradesh ke congress adhyaksh the
 When the Assembly elections were held in November 1993, the Congress won unexpectedly
 is jeet ke baad mukhyamantri banane kii daud main shyama charan shukla, madhavrao sindhiya or subhash yadav jaise netaa shaamil ho gaye
 The funny thing is that Digvijay Singh was an MP at that time and did not contest assembly elections
 ek report ke mutabik digvijay singh ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad yah bhi kaha gaya ki madhavrao ko rokane ke liye arjuna singh or digvijay singh ne swang rachaa tha
 However, there is no evidence of this
 varisht patrkaar or raajnneetik vishleshak gauri shankar rajhans bataate hai ki digvijay ko shyama charan shukla raajnneeti main lekar aae or arjuna singh ne unako pehali baar mantri banaaya or donon ke saath dibba khulaa to digvijay singh mukhyamantri ban gaye
 The meeting of the legislature party started in the midst of heavy competition in which the Chief Minister was to be elected
 varisht patrkaar or raajnneetik vishleshak enke singh bataate hai ki arjuna singh ne pichhadaa varg se mukhyamantri banane kii vakaalat karte hue subhash yadav kaa naam aage badha diya
 Seeing that there was no consensus on Subhash's name in the meeting, Arjun Singh accepted his defeat and went out after finishing his speech
 unhone bataaya ki is dauraan madhav raav sindhiya dilli main helicopter ke saath phone aane kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 He was told that as soon as the news is given, Bhopal will come immediately
 shyamacharan or subhash yadav ke mukhyamantri na banane par arjuna singh apane vidhayakon kaa samarthan madhavrao ko de denge
 The trial was going on in the meeting
 kendriya paryvekshak ke taur par vahaan pranab mukherjee, susheel kumaar scindia or janardan pujari maujuud the
 When the controversy escalated, Pranab Mukherjee conducted a secret ballot in which 56 out of 174 mlas expressed their opinion in favor of Shyamacharan
 jabaki 100 se zyada vidhayakon ne digvijay ke paksh main matdaan kiya tha
 After the result, Kamal Nath ran towards the room where the only telephone of the entire building was on
 kamalnath ne vahaan se dilli kisi ko phone kiya
 The then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao from Delhi told Pranab Mukherjee on phone that the mlas who voted the most in favor should be made the Chief Minister
 is puure naatakeey ghatnakram ke baad digvijay singh mukhyamantri ban gaye or madhavrao phone kaa intjaar hi karte rahe
 Book Name: Gulam Mandi (novel) Writer: Nirmala Bhuradia Prakasak: Current Publication Price: 395 (hardcover) There is a lot of debate on global scale from terrorism to global warming and health
 ek rashtradhyaksh duusare rashtradhyaksh se mulaakaat karte hai, duniyabar kii samasyaon par chintan karte hai, suzav dete hai, raste nikaale jate hai, samitiyaan banati hai or unpar kaam hota he
 Worldwide, if asked from a school child to an adult citizen what is the world's biggest problem, one answer can usually be terrorism, global warming or unemployment or health
 lekin in sab se itar human trephiking or vaishyavriti samaaj kii aisi beemaari he, jisapar charchaa yaa to lajimi nahin samajhi jaati yaa phir un par khule munh baat karnaa saamaajik sabhyataa ko neeche kii ore le jaataa he
 It is not that there are no laws and committees on this side
 chintan nahin hota, bahes nahin hoti
 But it can be judged by the seriousness that this disease started with human civilization has become more racy than before and we have not been able to reach anywhere other than intellectual debate
 samaaj main ek bahes gender ko lekar bhi he
 Of course India also gave a third gender to the legal country, but it also took more than 65 years after independence
 haalanki kaagajon main sammaan se itar isaki jamini hakeekat kitni dardanaak he yah bataane or samajhane kii jarurat nahin he
 Apparently our society from the country to the abroad is stuck with this chain of 'slavery' and the book 'ghulam Mandi' by journalist-turned-writer Nirmala Bhuradia is a link in this chain
 yah kadi asal main ek upanyaas he, lekin isaki kahani jaise-jaise aage badhati he pathak ke andar chintan kaa jaagran hota he
 Janaki and Kalyani are the heroines in this mandi
 lekin in sabake bich jine bhi he, jo america main chamakili roshni ke bich thirakate nange maance ke samoohon se hamaara parichay karwaati he
 The story has a spread in society, stereotypes, fear of being lost over time of beauty, as well as the bitter truth that gives a girl suffering from rape and the rapist the power of a victim
 lekhika ne bataur upanyaaskaar apane paatro ke jariye ek saath kai vishyon ko joda he
 For example, there is horse-trading in humans
 besharm duniya kii nangi sachai he, jo hamaam ke sabhi nangon ko sadak par laane kaa kaam karti he
 Apart from sexual frustration and the devilish mood of cannibals as human beings, apart from all this and an important part of the story is also the 'third gender', which has found reproach, humiliation and renunciation inborn from society
 yani kahani main bahut kuch he, lekin dilachasp yah bhi he ki sabhi ek-duusare se jude hue hai
 Some incidents in this 240-page story are fictitious, while many have a fraction of the truth
 saal 2006 main ek kaarykram ke tahat nirmala ko america jane kaa mauka mila, vahaan antarrashtriya str par insaanon kii kharid-farokht or raat ke andheron main chamakili roshni ke bich nange maance ke putalon ke bich jaakar unhone samasya ke nae ayaamon par chintan kiya
 This experience was sure to open new doors of thought and thinking for him and he also gave it a place in his novel as a writer
 yani kuch myanon main 'gulam mandi' vaishvik str par deh ke bazaar kii kadavi sachai par ek repotarge bhi he
 Why read if you want to deal with some other ground truth other than terrorism and global warming
 agar yah maanate hai ki vikaas kii bayaar or swatchta ke mishan se pehle yaa saath-saath viraasat main mili bimariyon kaa safaya karnaa ek jarurat he
 If you really feel guilty when calling a third gender a eunuch or eunuch
 agar insaan ko fal-subjiyon or sansaadhan se zyada or stri ke sharir ko nange maance se upar samajhate hai
 If you really want to think about this before experimenting with social truth

 'murder-3' frenchizi he film 'murder' kii, jiske pehle donon bhaag hit rahe hai
 
 
 Its name is 'murder-3', but it does not have a single murder
 
 
 ise murder mistry kii tarah dekha ja rahaa tha, lekin mistry ke naam par film main sirf ek mistry room he, jiske bare main zyada baat nahin kar sakate, kyonki aisa karne se suspence khatm ho jayega
 
 
 First of all, let me tell you that 'murder-3' is an adaptation of the Spanish thriller 'the Hidden Face'
 
 
 'murder-3' main vikram, yani randeep hooda stregling photographer hai south africa main, or unke paas behad pyaar karne vaali ek mahabuuba khushboo, yani aditi raav hydari, he, jo wel-setald hai
 
 
 But as soon as Vikram gets an offer from India for fashion photography, he comes to India and leaves everything with his fragrance
 
 
 yahaan aakar khushboo shaq karne lagati he vikram par or achaanak vah gaayab ho jaati he aisi jagah par, jahaan se vah vikram par nazar rakh sake
 
 
 Vikram's affair begins with Nisha after the disappearance of his girlfriend
 
 
 tippaniyan All the actors in the film have performed well, especially Aditi Rao Hydari
 
 
 imotional seens kaaphi achche hai
 
 
 The directorial debut of Vishesh Bhatt, who is directing the first film, is also good
 
 
 bas, vah ek achche concept ko parde par thik se akzicute nahin kar paae
 
 
 By the way, the investigation of the police looking for the lights seems childish, from inside the room, if someone beats the door with a pole and does not hear the person standing in front of it, something seems strange
 
 
 film kabhi murder mistry lagati he, kabhi horer
 
 
 There is no murder in 'murder-3'
 
 
 bas, pyaar kaa khun he or darshakon ke bharose kaa bhi, isliye 'murder-3' ke liye meri reating he, 2
 5 stars
 
 
 sabase pehle aapako bataa duun ki 'murder-3' adopshan he spanish thriller 'da hiden phase' kii
 
 
 'murder-3' is Vikram, ie Randeep Hooda Struggling Photographer in South Africa, and he has a much-loved Mehbooba Khushboo, Aditi Rao Hydari, who is well-set
 
 
 magar jaise hi vikram ko fishan photography ke liye bharat se ofer miltaa he, vah india aa jate hai or apana sab kuch chhodkar unke saath aa jaati he khushboo
 
 
 Here, Khushboo starts suspecting Vikram and suddenly she disappears to a place from where she can keep an eye on Vikram
 
 
 garlfrend ke gaayab hone ke baad vikram kaa afaire shuru hota he nisha ke saath
 
 
 The comments film main sabhi kalakaaron ne acha abhinay kiya he, khaastaur par aditi raav hydari ne
 
 
 Emotional scenes are very good
 
 
 pehali film diarect kar rahe vishesh bhatta kaa nirdesan bhi acha he
 
 
 Simply, he could not execute a good concept on screen properly
 
 
 vaise, roshni ko dhund rahi police kii chaanbin bachakaani lagati he, kamare ke andar se agar koi danda se daravaaza pite or uske saamne khadey insaan ko awaz na sunai de, kuch atapata lagata he
 
 
 The film sometimes looks like murder mystery, sometimes horror
 
 
 'murder-3' main koi murder nahin he
 
 
 That is the blood of love and also the trust of the audience, hence my rating for 'murder-3' is 2
 5 star
 
 
 All the actors in the film have performed well, especially Aditi Rao Hydari
 
 
 imotional seens kaaphi achche hai
 
 
 The directorial debut of Vishesh Bhatt, who is directing the first film, is also good
 
 
 bas, vah ek achche concept ko parde par thik se akzicute nahin kar paae
 
 
 By the way, the investigation of the police looking for the lights seems childish, from inside the room, if someone beats the door with a pole and does not hear the person standing in front of it, something seems strange
 
 
 film kabhi murder mistry lagati he, kabhi horer
 
 
 There is no murder in 'murder-3'
 
 
 bas, pyaar kaa khun he or darshakon ke bharose kaa bhi, isliye 'murder-3' ke liye meri reating he, 2
 5 stars
 
 
 vaise, roshni ko dhund rahi police kii chaanbin bachakaani lagati he, kamare ke andar se agar koi danda se daravaaza pite or uske saamne khadey insaan ko awaz na sunai de, kuch atapata lagata he
 
 
 The film sometimes looks like murder mystery, sometimes horror
 
 
 'murder-3' main koi murder nahin he
 
 
 That is the blood of love and also the trust of the audience, hence my rating for 'murder-3' is 2
 5 star

 '' un logon main se kya aap bhi hai jo tyoharon, shaadiyon yaa koi khaas mauka na ho to bhi, priyajanon ko uphaar ke rup main sona dena hi pasand karte hai? yaa phir aise vyakti hai jise nivesh ke liye sone kii pattee (gold baar) or sikke khareednaa sabase acha lagata he?yadi haa, to aap sone main nivesh ke dauraan zyada sooyeeboojh kaa parichay de sakate hai
 From 2015, the government introduced Sovereign Gold Bond or Government Gold Bond (SGB) which is not only physically equal to the value of gold but also gets interest like any other fixed income bond
 assel velth services ke agxcutive diarector brijesh paranami kehete hai, ''sona kharidne se acha he sarkari gold bond khareednaa
 2 in addition to the return of gold price increase on SGB to you
 5 pratishat kaa byaaj bhi upar se mil jaataa he
 "gold, whether it is in the form of jewelery or in the form of a gold bar or coin, it is risky to keep it
" esajibi ke phaayde ginate hue paranami kehete hai, ''esajibi ke saath sambhalakar rakhane jaisi baat nahin he
 There is neither the cost of making the jewelery nor the cost of smelting the jewelery nor any purity certificate is required
 ''behatar jaankariparnami us sone kii baat kar rahe hai, jo bhautik rup se sona nahin he balki jaise aap apane demat khate main shares ko rakhte hai usee tarah demat khate main aap esajibi ko rakh sakate hai
 In lockers, where banks charge you a fixed amount in exchange for keeping your physical gold, gold can be stored anywhere in SGB other than that
 in gold bond ke saath sarkaar kii guarantee judi he jiskaa arth he ki bhugtan main kisi prakaar ke her-pher kii koi gunjaaish hi nahin
 In SGB scheme, a person can buy at least one gram and gold up to four kg
 esajibi sidhe bank se yaa adhikrut dakgharon or manyata praapt stock exange athwa agenton ke madhyam se kharida ja saktaa he
 Currently, the government is offering a discount of Rs 50 per gram on online shopping
 leader7 financial adwiserij ke sansthaapak suresh sadagopan kehete hai, ''sarkaar salanaa 2
 Paying 5 percent interest
 aap sona rakhen to aapako kya miltaa he?'' byaaj kii rakam har chamahi par aapke bank khate main jamaa ho jaati he
 Can anyone opt out of SGB? The interest on SGB makes it very attractive but can be withdrawn in case of emergency? Although sgbs have a duration of eight years, one can also sell them as shares or bonds
 esajibi bharat ke mukhya share bazaar bombai stock exange (bisai) or neshnal stock exange (enesai) main soochibaddh he or inke jariye aap esajibi ko kharid yaa bech sakate hai
 The government also provides a facility to get out of it
 paanchaven, chathe yaa saatven saal ke puure hone par aap sarkaar ko bond waapas bhi kar sakate hai
 After completion of the eighth year the bond can be redeemed and the investor is paid at the then market price of gold
 apatkaaleen sthiti main esajibi par twarit rin bhi liya ja saktaa he
 "loan on gold is easily available," says Parnami
 bank bhi bhautik rup se sona rakhkar udhaar dete hai
 The same facility is provided on gold bonds as it is borrowed from gold
 ''sabase khara he sonaamtaur par log sona yaa to gahane banane ke liye yaa phir nivesh ke liye kharidte hai
 If there is any need suddenly, then it is very useful to keep the gold nearby
 agar makasad bhavishya ke liye nivesh karnaa he yaa phir kuch saal baad bacchon kii shaadi ke liye sona jamaa karnaa he to aise main esajibi behatar vikalp he
 Sadgopan says, "some people buy gold that will later come in the form of a son or daughter's wedding or a gift
" aise niveshkon ke liye esajibi sarvshereshth vikalp he
 "taking the point of Sadagopan further," Parnami says, "SGB is a suitable option for those who buy gold for investment and invest savings in gold
" ''shaadi-byaah main sone kii kharid hi sabase bada kharch ban jaati he isliye thodaa-thodaa karke esajibi aapaki jaruraton ke liye sahuuliyat vaala or surakshit jariya he
 With this, you get the average value of the price of gold in the years of investment, as well as some interest
 yah aath saal kii avadhi ke baad aapako nishchit maatra main sona or us par byaaj sunishchit karata he
 "whenever the government issues SGB, any person can invest in it," says Parnami
 ''nivesh ke rup main sonakya kisi ko apane saare phixd diposit khatm karke, saare share bechakar esajibi kharid lenaa chahie? jaankaar aisa karne se manaa karte hai
 Vijay Mantri, co-promoter of Buckfast Financial Advisory Services, says, "one of the biggest problems with advising someone to invest in gold or any financial product related to gold is that people invest indiscriminately in it and eventually the excess metal Buy it
 ''visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki kisi bhi vyakti ko nivesh kaa paanch se 15 pratishat tak hi sone main karnaa chahie
 Gold bars (bars), coins, gold mutual funds and SGB can all be included
 sadagopan kehete hai, ''chunki sone kaa duusari vittiya sampattiyon ke saath nakaaratmak kism kaa aapasi rishta hota he isliye portpholio main agar sahi str tak kaa nivesh sone main hua ho to vah equities yaa bond jaisi duusari sampattiyon main aane vaali asthirataa ke jatke ko aasaani se avashoshit kar saktaa he
 There is no harm in keeping five to ten percent of your investment in gold
 ''tex par asaresajibi main nivesh par byaaj to miltaa hi he, iske alaava yadi is bond ko uski puri avadhi tak rakhaa jaae to sarkaar tex main bhi chhot detii he
 "if you physically hold gold or SGB for more than three years, it is considered a long-term holding and it becomes eligible for 20 per cent long-term capital gains (LTCG) with indexation," says Parnami
 
 haa, teen saal pehle bech dete hai to yah short turm capital gen (estisiji) main gina jayega or is par us vyakti ke vyaktigat tex daayre ke mutabik hi astijisi lagegaa
 However, if you keep SGB for its entire duration, then the receipt on it will be completely tax free
 esajibi par jo byaaj milegaa, bas usee par tex lagegaa
 Says Parnami, "the benefit of investing can be increased due to the convenience of buying a small amount because any investor can further enlarge the investment portfolio by bringing all the gold in one account as well as the benefit of the average value of the rupee
" Can take lambey samay ke liye nivesh kar rahe hai to 2
 5 percent annual interest can make a big difference on the total return of investment

 dilli sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko avaidh coloniyon main registry shuru karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Conflicts in the MCD and AAP government have increased once again, because MCD is talking of passing out lay-out plans, but on the condition of getting the money for take-out plans
 registry par roak hataane kii taiyaari main AAP sarkaradilli ke dipti siem manish sisodiya ke bayaan ke baad se ek baar phir emsidi or dilli kii AAP sarkaar aamane-saamne aane vaali he, kyonki sarkaar ne anadhikrut coloniyon main registry shuru karne kaa faisla kiya he
 But according to the corporation, this work is not going to be so easy, because without registering the lay-out plan, the system will completely collapse
 agar le-out plan nigam se taiyaar karwaanaa he, to pehle dilli sarkaar yaa sambandhit RWA ko le-out plan ke liye nigam ko rakam deni hogi
 MCD will not delay in passing the lay-out plan as soon as the amount is received
 emsidi ke mutabik coloniyon main registry khulne kaa kaam dilli sarkaar ke is elaan ke saath hi nahin ho jaataa ki coloniyon kii boundry tay kii ja rahi he or boundry tay hote hi registry shuru ho jaaengi, kyonki boundry tay karne ke baad hi le-out plan banataa he
 It tells where houses are and where land has been left for schools, parks or other facilities
 agar aisa nahin kiya gaya yani boundry tay karne ke baad hi registry kaa kaam shuru kar diya gaya, to kis plot kaa koun maalik he yaa kis plot par skool yaa anya suvidhaayen di jaani hai, iskaa nipataara nahin ho saktaa
 This would lead to different claims of proprietary rights
 jaahir he ki dilli sarkaar is faisle se yah dikhaane kii koshish kii he ki coloniyon kii registry kaa rasta usne khol diya he
 If there is a delay, MCD can be blamed for it
 is tarah le-out plan banane main hone vaali deree par dilli sarkaar apane haath jhaad sakati he or sara thikra emsidi yani bijepi par phutegaa
 In this case, the AAP will definitely try to take a political edge in this matter
 shanivaar ko kashmir ke baraamula ke sopor ilaake ke amargarh main surakshabalon ne teen aatankiyon ko maar giraaya
 Three AK 47 rifles have been found from the slain militants
 saath hi or bhi kai hathiyaar mili hai
 According to the information so far, one of them is from Pakistan and two are local terrorists
 shuukravaar der raat do baje sena , police or siarpief ne pakki khufia soochna ke aadhaar par par pehle caso yani carden and search oparation chalaaya
 In the area where there is suspicion, the security forces surrounded the entire village and searched
 isi dauraan surakshabalon ko ek ghar se aatankiyon ke chupe hone kaa pataa chalaa
 After this, there were about three hours of encounter with the security forces and the terrorists
 surakshabalon ke firing main teenon aatanki maare gaye
 a policeman has been injured in this action
 yah bhi padhein-narendra modi ke satta main aane ke baad se sainya pratishthanon par hue 10 hamale Like South Kashmir, the security forces in North Kashmir are running Operation All Out against the terrorists
 uttari kashmir main videsh aatankiyon kii tadaad zyada he jabaki dakshin kashmir main sthaneey aatankiyon kii sankhya adhik he

 pichley saat maheene main kareeb 120 aatanki maare ja chuke hai
 Top commanders of terrorists are also being killed one by one
 ek anumaan ke mutabik mana jaataa he ki abhi kashmir main do sau ke kareeb aatanki sakriy he
 At two o'clock on Friday, the army, police and CRPF conducted the first caso i
e
 cardon and search operation on the basis of confirmed intelligence
 ilke antargat jis ilaake main andeh hota he vahaan par surakshabal puure gaanv ko gher kar talaashi lete he
 Meanwhile, the security forces came to know about the hiding of terrorists from a house
 iske baad surakshabalon or aatankiyon ke saath kareeb teen ghante muthbhed chali
 All three terrorists were killed in the firing of security forces
 is karrwai main police kaa ek jawan ghayal hua he

 chunavi parinaamon ke intjaar kii is besabri main aaj varun dhawan or aalia bhatta kii film 'badrinaath kii dulhaniyaan' relies hui he
 This film is the story of Badrinath and Vaidehi's love
 varun dhawan yani badrinaath apane pyaar aalia bhatta yani vaidehi ko apni dulhaniyaan banane kii har mumkin koshish karata he magar vaidehi shaadi ke mandap se bhaag jaati he
 Why and where Vaidehi runs away, you will have to watch the film
 is film ke anya pahaluon par baat karen to film badrinaath kii dulhaniyaan ek halki- phulki lav story he jisamen uttar pradesh ke jhaansi yaa yun kahen ki bharat ke chote shahar kii jhalak he jahaan log riti rivaajon or paramparaon se samjhauta bahut kam karte hai
 The comments karan johar ke production house main bani is film main kamedi kaa behtareen tadakaa he
 It also has some emotion and drama in it
 film kaa pehla bhaag bahut acha he or is hisse kii raftaar bhi tej he
 There are a lot of incidents in the film and Badrinath is struggling to get his bride
 is film main bhi aalia bhatta or varun dhawan kii chemistry kaaphi acchhee he
 But the weakness of the film is its second half which is slightly weak
 aisa laga jaise kahani aage bad nahin rahi he use jabardastee badhaayaa ja rahaa he
 Many scenes seem strange as Badrinath fights in Singapore
 'badrinaath kii dulhaniyaan' kii khaas baat ye he ki majaak-majaak main kaaphi syrius baton par bhi tanj kas jaati he
 Like how in today's era, how are laddoos of good quality distributed on the birth of a son, and bend over the birth of a daughter
 kis tarah dahej jaisi pratha aaj bhi kaayam he or padhi likhi ladki ko byaahne ke liye bhi dahej kii baari rakam di jaati he
 This film tells how boys are an asset or important thing for their family and girls are a responsibility for the family
 is film ko hamaari taraf se milte hai 3 star
 Made in the production house of Karan Johar, this film has a great temper of comedy
 ya saath hi isamen thode imoshan or drama bhi he
 The first part of the film is very good and the pace of this part is also fast
 film main kaaphi sari ghatnaayen hoti hai or badrinaath apni dulhaniyaan ko hasil karne kii jaddojahad kar rahaa he
 Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan's chemistry in this film is also very good
 lekin film kii kamajori he iskaa second half jo thodaa kamjor padaa he
 It felt as if the story is not moving forward, it is being forcefully enhanced
 kai drishy atapate lagate hai jaise badrinaath kaa singapore main ladaai jhagada karnaa
 The special thing about 'badrinath Ki Dulhania' is that even on many serious things jokes are tightened
 jaise ki kaise aaj ke daur main bhi kis tarah bete ke janm par acchhee quality ke laddu baante jate hai or beti ke janm par sanste pede
 How the practice like dowry is still prevalent and a huge amount of dowry is given to the educated girl for marrying
 yah film bataati hai ki kaise ladke apane parivaar ke liye ek sampatti yaa jaruri cheez or ladkiyaan parivaar ke liye ek jimmedaari hoti hai
 This film gets 3 stars from our side
 'badrinaath kii dulhaniyaan' kii khaas baat ye he ki majaak-majaak main kaaphi syrius baton par bhi tanj kas jaati he

 adaalat ne police ke is ravaie par naaraazgi jaahir kii he ki vah jibi road red lite ilaake main deh vyapaar or maanav taskari ke liye jimmedaar asli aparaadhiyon ko benakaab nahin karti he
 In Tis Hazari Court, Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja has slammed the Delhi Police for not finding the real owners of the rooms running in the GB Road Red Light area
 court ne kaha ki aisa lagata he police deh vyapaar ke liye kothaa chalaane waalon ko shah de rahi he
 The court has said in its judgment that the police do not make any special effort to arrest the real criminals of human trafficking and prostitution
 isi vajah se aise aparaadh karne vaale asli chehre benakaab nahin ho pate, jinhen is gorakhdhandhe kii puri jaankaree hoti he
 The court has directed the police commissioner to take action against the black traffickers of human trafficking and prostitution
 ladakiyon se jabardastee deh vyapaar karaane kii aaropee puspa naam kii ek mahila ko bari karte hue court ne ye baaten apane faisle main kahin
 The court said in its judgment that in view of the work of the Kamla Market Police in this case and many other cases, it is necessary that a copy of the judgment be sent to the Commissioner of Police
 police kamishnar yah tay karenge ki aage is tarah ke maamalon main jo chargeshit daakhil hon, wo pukhta hon, taaki maanav taskari or deh vyapaar jaise aparaadh karne vaale asli logon ko sajaa mil sake or aise aparaadhon par lagaam lag sake
 Not only the lower court, but also the Delhi High Court has instructed the police many times before to stop such crimes
 lekin taaja faisla bataata he ki aise aparaadh or aparaadhiyon par lagaam lagane ke liye police kitni gambhir he
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has been accused of bribery for the first time
 aam aadmi party se bade beabaru hokar nikaal die gaye yogendra yadav ko bhi is aarope par yakeen nahin ho rahaa he
 Kumar Vishwas also stood with Kapil Mishra
 lekin is kalank katha main ek kirdaar aisa he jiskaa baar-baar zikr ho rahaa he, wo kirdaar hai satyendra jain
 Kejriwal is putting his hands on Jin's head so strongly that everyone is surprised
 sawaal ye he ki kya kejariwal ko satyendra jain kii kerani kaa khamiyaja bhugatna pad rahaa he, kyonki sach yahi he ki kejariwal par rishwatakhori ke aarope par naa to yogendra yadav yakeen kar rahe hai naa kumaar vishwaas jabaki satyendra jain par bijepi ke hamale kii dharkageriwal se bhi zyada tezhai
 BJP is attacking Kejriwal with two arguments on Kapil Mishra's allegations
 pehali daleel ye ki kapil mishra cabinet ke sadsy the, isliye wo jo kuch kah rahe hai use ankhon dekha saboot mana jaae
 The second argument is that Kejriwal stood as a security shield in the allegations against Satyendra Jain, which means that there is some black in the pulses somewhere
 kya satyendra jain kii saraparasti kii keemat kejariwal ko chukaani pad rahi he? kya satyendra jainakejariwal kii wo kamjor kadihain jis par bijepi lagaataar hathaudaa markar brands kejariwal kaa dam nikaal rahi he
 These are not the first allegations on Satyendra Jain
 aaropon kii lambii fehrist unke naam se darj he
 - The most serious charge on Satyendra Jain is to keep in touch with hawala traders
 -satyendra jain par aarope he ki unhone companiyaan banaakar hawala se karodo banaae or unka istemaal kar 200 acre jameen kharidi
 - Income tax department issued notice against Jain in these cases, preliminary investigation was also done and some properties were also attached
 -satyendra jain swasthya mantralay main salaahkaar ke pad par beti kii niyukti ko lekar bhi sawaalon ke ghere main aae
 The Shunglu Committee also questioned the appointment of Zain's daughter Soumya
 -kejariwal ke rishtedaar nikunj agarwal ko oesady banane par satyendra jain ke khilaaf exiaar darj kii thi kyonki nikunj kii niyukti main dhaandhlee ke aarope lage the
 Satyendra Jain's chair was saluted amidst the internal and external rounds of Kejriwal's cabinet
 tamaam aaropon ke baavjad satyendra jain kaa bal baankaa nahin hua
 Satyendra Jain remained a confidant of Kejriwal and because of him the BJP continued to dominate the Aam Aadmi Party
 ye kam hairaani kii baat nahin

 aise hi uske ghar main lage ek sisitivi camere ne is katl kaa raaj khol diya
 Amit has confessed his crime
 ab police amit kii maa ko talash rahi he
 Because he did not report to the police despite knowing about the murder
 notebandi kaa sidhaa asar naqli noton kii taskari par padaa he

 Film actress Mahima Chaudhary has come out in protest against those who say that girls should not leave the house at night for their safety

 Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait objected to Mahima's statement and said that Mahima should apologize
 khap ne kaha tha, chaumin kii vajah se hote hai rapakuch samay pehle haryana main badhate rape ke maamle par khaapon ne kaha tha ki rajya main balaatkaar ke maamle isliye bad rahe hai, kyonki yuva chaumin kha rahe hai
 His argument on his statement is that the hormones of the youth are increasing by eating chowmin, which makes them excited for rape
 jald shaadi karaane se rukenge rape: khapaharyana main balaatkaar ke maamle saamne aane par khap ne kaha tha ki vivaah kii tay umr seemaa khatm kar deni chahie, jisase bacchon kii sahi samay par shaadi ho jaae or wo bhataken nahin
 a representative of the Khap Panchayat, Sube Singh, had said, "boys and girls should be married by the time they are 16, so that they do not wander
" isse balaatkaar kii ghatnaon main kami aegi
 'another Khap member said,' It is natural for children to develop sexual desires in young people, when they are not fulfilled, they go astray
 isliye shaadi kii koi nunatam umr nahin honi chahie
 "women for 40 years do not go to the market" Last year, the panchayat of many fraternities had issued Taliban decrees against women

 The Panchayat, in its decree, prohibited love marriage and said that at first no one can do love marriage in the village
 agar kar liya to use gaanv se nikaal diya jayega
 He will not be able to live in the village who will marry to his liking

 After the indore-patna Express train incident, on Tuesday morning, all the eyewitnesses started coming up at Kanpur Central Railway Station, people were giving information about the accident to the police according to themselves
 haadase kii jaanch kar rahe kamishnar railway sefti pi
 K
 acharya ne kaha ki siares ke mutabik koi shuruaati yaa antarim jaanch ke nattejey vah nahin denge,puri report aane main kam se kam ek maheene kaa vakt lag saktaa he
 After checking the accident site and the train bogie for two days, on Tuesday, the statements of all the people who are eyewitnesses of this incident began to be recorded
 mangalvaar subah apana bayaan darj karaane sabase pehle us train kadriver jalaj sharmaaya jisapar sabaki nigahen lagi thi, kamishnar railway sefti ke saamne kareeb 1 ghante tak usne apana bayaan darj karaayaa, jaanch kamishan ke saamne uskidobaraa peshi hogi
 After his statement, the railway officials quietly took him out of the back door to save him from the media
 driver jalaj sharmazaanch kamishnake saamne se aayaa to usne kisi se baat nahin kii, vahiin duusare sahyogi udai purohit ne bataaya ki hamaare paas gadabadi kii koi soochna nahin thi, upar se bhi koi khabar nahin thi
 Speaking to the media on Tuesday evening, in response to a question, Commissioner Railway Safety P
 ke acharya ne kaha ki donon loko payalto ke blad sample liye gaye hai ,is baat kii report aana baaki he ki ye log sharaab ke nashe main the yaa nahin
 The chairman of the same inquiry committee also said that 3 people have been questioned so far, two drivers and one loco inspector are being interrogated, railway tracks are being sent to RDS for investigation
 iske saath hi sabhi bayanon ko railway mantralay ko bhi saunpa jayega
 Hot air and increased temperatures during the summer season increase the risk of sunstroke
 agar achaanak sharir kaa taapmaana bad jaay yaa phir sir main tej dard hona achaanak se shuru ho jaay to saavdhaan ho janaa chahie
 Both of these are symptoms of heat stroke
 lu lagane ke kidney, dimag or dil par bura prabhaav padataa he jisase in angon kii kaaryakshmata prabhavit hoti he
 After heat stroke, pulse and breath speed increases
 kai baar dekha gaya he ki twachaa par laal dane bhi ho jate hai
 Many people also complain of frequent urination and tightness in the body due to heat stroke
 chilchilaati garmi main lu se bachane ke liye gharelu upaay kaaphi kargar sabit hote hai
 Let's know some very effective home remedies to avoid the sun
 dhoop main nikalate vakt chaate kaa istemaal karnaa chahie
 The sun can also be avoided by covering the head and venturing into the sun
 ghar se pani yaa koi thanda sharbat pikar baahar nikalen
 Such as mango panna, shikanji, poppy juice is more beneficial
 tej dhoop se aate hi or zyada pasinaa aane par fouran thanda pani nahin pinaa chahie
 One should keep drinking water frequently during summer days so that there is no shortage of water in the body
 pani main neembu or namak milakar din main do-teen baar pite rahane se lu lagane kaa khatra kam rahata he
 'when i saw the picture of my ex girlfriend in my husband's phone' One should not go empty stomach while going out in the sun
 subjiyon ke soup kaa seven karne se bhi lu se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Light food should be taken during summer
 bhojan main dahi ko shaamil karnaa chahie
 Despite such vigilance, if there is a heat stroke, then take these measures
 1
 Before bathing, mixing barley flour in water and making a paste and applying it on the body after some time, the effect of the heat is reduced by taking a bath with cold water
 2
 To avoid sunstroke, make a paste of raw mango and massage it on the soles of the feet
 aise ladakon ko zyada samay tak bardaasht nahin karatin ladkiyaan3
 Heat rash and heat causes heat rash on the body
 besan ko pani main gholkar ghamauriyon par lagane se phayda hota he
 4
 lu lagane par jau ke aate or pyaaj ko piskar paste banaaen or use sharir par lagaaein
 There will definitely be relief
 5
 Applying the onion on the nail before going out in the sun does not cause heatstroke
 yahi nahin dhoop main baahar nikalate vakt agar ap chhila hua pyaaj lekar saath chalenge to bhi aapako lu nahin lagegi
 6
 dhoop se aane ke baad thodaa sa pyaaj kaa ras shahad main milakar chaatane se lu lagane kaa khatra kam hota he
 7
 garmi ke mausam main khaane ke baad gud khaane se bhi lu lagane kaa dar kam hota he
 8
 tamaato kii chatnee, nariyal or petha khaane se bhi lu nahi lagati
 The Vyapam scam is once again in discussion in Madhya Pradesh
 congress ne kuch kathith dastavejon ke saath shivaraj sarkaar par joardaar hamalaa bolaa he
 All Congress leaders have accused Shivraj Singh Chauhan and his family of involvement in the scam and demanded his resignation
 digvijay singh ne kaha ki kuch din pehle yah kaha gaya tha ki rajyapal kaa betaa serial number 106-115 tak kii niyukti main shaamil he
 At the same time, Digvijay Singh claimed that CM was written in front of some serial numbers
 varisht vakil keties tulsi ne kaha ki vyapam ke kaagajon main siem ke karyaalay kaa naam badalakar governor house likh diya gaya he
 Also, the name of Uma Bharti was written in place of cm's name
 saath hi congress ne netaa kamalnath ne aarope lagaaya ki is ghotaale main mukhyamantri or unke parivaar ko bachaaya ja rahaa he
 He also said that the hard disk of a computer of the department has also been replaced
 unhone kaha ki yah logon ke saath anyaay he or iske siem or unke mantri jimmedaar hai
 He demanded the resignation of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and said that STF is acting at the behest of CM
 samvaadadaata sammelan main maujuud jyotiraditya sindhiya ne kaha ki rajya ke logon ke saath dhokhaa hua he or rajya sarkaar ne kaagajon ke saath chhedchhad kii he
 He said that guilty people are roaming free and innocent students are behind bars
 vahiin congressi netaa suresh pachori ne maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kii maang kii he
 Earlier, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh submitted important documents on Monday to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed to probe the scams in the examinations conducted by the Professional Examination Board (vyapam) in Madhya Pradesh
 in dastavejon main kya he, singh ne is baat kaa khulaasa nahin kiya he
 There is widespread fraud in PMT, Transport constable, teacher recruitment examinations conducted by Vyapam in the state
 jabalpur ucch nyaayalay ke nirdesh par esaiti ke adhinsth vishesh kaarydal (estf) jaanch kar rahaa he
 Many people have been arrested in this case so far
 isamen prashaanik adhikari se lekar purv mantri va vibhinn dalon ke rajaneta bhi shaamil hai
 Former state Chief Minister Digvijay Singh had filed a petition in the High Court seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), but it was rejected by the court
 singh somvaar ko varisht adhivaktaa vivek tankha ke saath anya logon kii maujuudagi main esaiti pramukh chandresh bhushan se mili or dastavej bhi saunpe
 The SIT chief admitted during a discussion with the media that among the documents submitted by Digvijay is a new document, he will get it tested by the STF if needed
 ‘kaajiyon or moulanaon ne lambey samay tak quran kii galat vyakhya kar muslim samudaay ko bahakaaya he
 Women have never been given secondary status in Islam or Quran
 lekin galat vyakhya kaa prachaar kar in logon ne mahilaon ke saath ho rahi ninsaphi ko rokane kii jagah use badhaava diya
 Shaista Amber, chairperson of the Muslim Personal Law Board, says that if the All India Muslim Personal Law Board had done its duty, women would not have to go to court
 darasal 28 disambar guuruuvaar komuslim women protection of ritis on marij bill, 2017loksabhaa main pesh hona he
 In such a situation, the commotion is bound to happen
 ol india muslim personal lau board is bill kaa shuru se hi virodh kar rahaa he
 According to All India Muslim Personal Law Board member Sajjad Nomani, all related parties have not been negotiated before bringing the bill against triple talaq
 board ke duusare sadsy moulana khalid safullah rahamaani ne kaha he ki vah pradhanmantri narendra modi ko khat likhakar is bill kaa rivyuu karne kii guzarish karenge
 Maharun Shaista Ambar kept women from the entitlements found in Islam, says: 'there is no law in the Quran like divorce-e-biddat
 yani ek baar main teen talaak kahkar talaak lene kii prakriya kaa zikr kahin nahin he
 Getting divorced is a process
 is prakriya main teen maah lagate hai
 This period is called Tuhr
 is dauraan yah pakkaa kiya jaataa he ki kahin aurat garbhvatee to nahin
 This period was also kept so that no decision should be taken in anger or impulse
 iske baad muslim dharmaguruon ke hastkshep or counselling ke baad talaak hota he
 'ambar says that it is not a part of religion but a social evil
 jise khatm karne kaa jimmaa samudaay kii jimmedaar sansthaaon kaa hota he
 The All India Muslim Personal Law Board should state how many times it has ruled such a divorce illegitimate? Also tell how many times meetings were held in mosques to make women of Muslim community aware? Commercials were removed
 muslim samudaay main nikaah ek kantrect he yah majahab kaa hissaa nahin he
 But by continuously associating it with religion, the Maulanas allowed the Muslim men to run arbitrary
 1986 main shah bano maamle ke baad mentinence act aayaa tha, jisamen vakf board dwaara talakshuda auraton ko khaanaa kharchaa dene kii baat kahi gai thi
 But women do not know about it
 yah kaam ol india muslim personal lau board kaa tha ki vah is adhikaar ke bare main ishtihaar ke jariye, masjidon main anounsament ke jariye iskaa prachaar kare
 So was this done? In Islam it is also said that misuse of mili power for katlak is a punishment for whips
 lekin yah sabit karnaa hota he ki durupyog hua he to phir talaak kii power kaa beja istemaal kar auraton ko talaak dene vaale kitne mardon ko kodon kii sajaa hui? zyaadaatar auraton ko yah pataa hi nahin he
 It is forbidden to divorce by phone, on whatsapp, by letter, by writing on water
 is par kaajiyon ne chuppi kyon nahin todi
 The fight will continue for a long time, says Shaista Ambar, chairperson of the Women's Personal Law Board, "the fight will continue even after triple talaq is enacted
" women personal lau board kii taraf se supreme court main daali gai yachika main tripal talaak, halaala or bahuvivaah par roak lagane kii maang kii gai thi
 However, apart from triple talaq, the Supreme Court has not yet touched both the other cases
 lekin women personal lau board ne taiyaari shuru kar di he halaala or bahuvivaah ke khilaaf dobaaraa yachika daakhil karne kii
 What is Halala? In Shariat law, Halala is a way of reclaiming the same wife who is destined for the husband after three divorces
 yani teen talaak dene ke baad agar phir shuhar apni bivi ko waapas apane saath rakhana chaahe to pehle us aurat kaa nikaah kisi duusare mard se karavaaya jaataa he
 The woman's second husband divorces her after passing with her one night
 or phir vah apane pehle pati se nikaah kar leti he
 This entire process is halala
 bahuvivahsharia kanoon muslim purush ko chaar vivaah karne kii ijaajat detaa he
 But the condition behind this permission is extremely difficult
 shysta ambar kahati hai, quran ke anusaar doosraa vivaah tabhi kiya ja saktaa he jab shuhar apni pehali patni ko baraabar haq de sake
 Could get his consent
 jabardastee haraam he
 If both women cannot give justice like the point of scales, then the other is prohibited from marrying
 ambar puuchhati hai kya aaj ke jamaane main aisa karnaa mumkin he
 The purpose behind putting such strict terms in the Quran was also to think ten times before committing polygamy
 lekin kya aisa hota he? isliye apane aap main yah kadi sharten hi hamaari yachika kaa aadhaar banengi
 What is the proposed triple talaq law? The cabinet passed the Muslim Women (protection of Rights on Marriage) bill on 15 December
 prastaavit kanoon ke anusaar ek baar main teen talaak dena gaiyr kanoonee hoga
 a person who violates this law has also been punished for three years

 phir kya tha unke prashansakon ko aisa laga ki is haar se niraash dhoni koi bada kadam uthaane vaale hai
 This video related to Dhoni has gone viral on social media
 charchaa yah shuru ho gai ki dhoni sanyas lene vaale hai
 Also, many fans tried to explain why Dhoni took the ball from the umpire

 Maybe Dhoni has kept the ball to cherish memories of the last bilateral ODI series in England
 visham paristhatiyo main kai baar team india ko ubaraane vaale mahendra singh dhoni england ke khilaaf tisare or nirnaayak vanade ke dauraan koi karishma nahin kar paae
 Dhoni was able to score 42 runs in 66 balls, due to which Team India could not give England a big target
 aakhir main shardul thakur ne do chhakkon kii madad se 13 gend par naabad 22 ran bana kar team ke score ko 250 ke paar pahunchaaya

 ’’ laal kile kii pracheer se pradhanmantri narendra modi ko sunakar tex adhikari jarur muskaraae honge, kyonki sach to vah he jo rajasav vibhaag or pravartan nideshaalay ke band kamaron main unase kaha jaataa he
 For the last six-seven years, the governments of India have been in a deep dilemma regarding tax administration
 ve kar niyamon main udaartaa or sakhti ke bich sahi santulan bana paatin, isse pehle kukhyat tex naukarshahi ne kar or vittiya kaamkaaj ke kanoonon ko nirmam banaakar, karadaataaon ko sataane kii akut takat juta lee
 However, since when did the new income tax law not come and GST was brought with the promise of easing the tax system
 to phir aisa kya ho gaya ki tex naukarshahi kaarobaariyon ke liye aatank kaa nayaa naam ban gai he
 This era of tax terror is the result of the Anti Money Laundering Act (amended in 2009 and 2013 enacted from 2005) which not only changed the bureaucratic outlook on business but also gave them terrible power
 janm se hi vivaadit is kanoon main ab tak ke sabase sakht praavdhaanon (sampatti kii kurki, asambhav jamaanat) kii madad se pravartan nideshaalay (enforcement diarectoret) desh kii sabase taqatvar satarkta agency ban gai he
 India joined in a strange manner in the Global Campaign against Money Laundering
 pehali endie sarkaar (vaajapeyi) ke daur main bhartiya arthvyavastha main udaarikaran ke bich sarkaar ne videshi mudra vinimay ko bhayanak pheraa kanoon kii jakad se mukt kiya tha
 It was replaced by FEMA which classified foreign exchange rules as a civil offense
 lekin tab tak aatank ko vitt poshan or nashili dawaaon ke kaarobaar ko rokane ke liye efeetief (1989) or sanyukt raashtra kii aguai main mani londring kanoonon par global sahmati (1998) ban chuki thi, jisane america par aatanki hamale (9 / 11) ke baad teji pakadi
 As a result, FEMA, which liberalized the use of foreign exchange and the Anti Money Laundering Act on Strict Trade, were simultaneously introduced in Parliament (2002-yashwant Sinha)
 2009 ke baad is kanoon ke daant dikhne shuru hue
 In 2012, the controversy over the imposition of tax (vodafone) from the previous date arose and the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee was heard saying that India is not a tax haven
 is vakt tak rajasav naukarshahi desh ke har kaarobaar ko sambhavit mani londring ke chashme se dekhne lagi thi
 The Anti Money Laundering Act is so frightening because • It is the only law in which ED officials can confiscate property on the basis of their assessment (reason to Believe)
 adaalat kii manjuuri jaruri nahin he
 If the money laundering property is abroad then the equivalent property will be confiscated in India
 • kareeb do darjan pramukh kanoon or 75 se adhik aparaadh iske daayre main hai
 These also include trademarks, environmental destruction offenses
 iske alaava asankhya sambhavit aparaadhon (predicket offence) main bhi mani londring lag saktaa he
 Income tax and GST are not under it but on cases related to tax fraud, officers can seize property by accusing them of money laundering
 • 2017 main supreme court ke aadesh tak is kanoon main jamaanat bhi mushkil thi
 Even now it is not easy
 sust abhiyojan ke liye kukhyat idi ne 2,000 se zyada filein khol rakhi hai lekin aadha darjan maamalon kaa bhi abhiyojan nahin hua he
 Since 2005, there has not been any acquittal in the anti money laundering
 vakil jaanate hai ki kisi bhi aparaadh main yah kanoon lagu ho saktaa he or kaarobaari kaa sab kuch khatm ho saktaa he
 Some of the latest changes under the Income Tax (stricter provisions for prosecution or the latest law to hide black money abroad) are also inspired by this
 bharat kii vittiya satarkta agenciyon ke do chehre hai
 Through one, she makes headlines in big cases (eg Chidambaram) at the behest of politics and eventually piles up in court (2G, Coal, Commonwealth) while the other face scares the businessmen with her strength
 sanad rahe ki lachar vyavastha main behad sakht kanoon utpeedak ban jate hai or bhrashtachar badhaate hai
 How much money laundering has reduced in India? If something had happened, the havoc of demonetisation would not have broken! The BJP came to power during the UPA government by cursing tax terror
 par aaj pradhanmantri hi laal kile se tex ke aatank ko bisur rahe hai
 Look at the fun that the Prime Minister is saying to his own government that not all businessmen should be treated as tax evaders! Poor businessmen will be judged by the Tomera murderers, what will be done in my right! *** samsung kii blue fest cell 19 november tak he jarismartphone samet dheron products par discountsamsung Galaxy M10s samet company ke kai products par blue fest cell ke dauraan discount diya ja rahaa he

 Bhardwaj said that he wanted his government to become a well-known government in Karnataka

 In the last two days in New Delhi, the BJP delegation met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pratibha Patil, demanding the dismissal of Bhardwaj's recommendation to implement President's rule in the state and recall them

 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne bijepi par jammu-kashmir ke baadh peediton ko madad muhaiyaa karaane ke naam par raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Sonia Gandhi said that the Modi government showed big dreams before coming to power but nothing was done after forming the government

 The demand made by the state government was also not met
 'unhone aage kaha, 'ham har vakt kashmir ke logon ke saath rahe

 The India Today team at Ground Zero found that most of the candidates are using printed leaflets in the election campaign
 chaatr netaaon ke samarthak baari maatra main campus main har jagah ye parche phenk rahe hai
 The situation is that these papers are lying on the streets outside many colleges
 isse parisar main har jagah kachare ke dher lag gaye hai

 If you talk about the expenses then every candidate is allowed to spend a maximum of Rs 5000

 abivipi ne chunaav ladane kaa tarika badal diya he jisamen ham demokrasi walls main bhi koi poster nahin lagaate yaa koi bhi ummidavaar cycle se prachaar nahin karata
 If any paper is also used, our student organization Student for Development (SFD) uses them for recycling
 ham drushtibaadhit students ko isi ricycle paper se bani diary dete hai
 We hope that this will change a lot in the coming years
 NSUI dilli ke rajya prabharee nikhil kamble ne kaha ki haal hi main NGT nirnyon ke saath lingadoh dishanirdeshon ko NSUI puri tarah se paalan karata he

 After this, the Congress government will give the minimum salary to the poor of the country directly without any middleman in their bank account

 After this, Rahul shouted slogans of 'chowkidar Chor Hai'

 kisaan apana karja maaf karne kii maang kar rahe hai lekin narendra modi ko kuch sunai nahin detaa
 He waived three and a half lakh crores of 15 people
 hamane do din main kisaanon kaa karja maaf kiya
 Congress protects the truth, they protect the lie
 desh main paise kii koi kami nahin he
 Farmers are asked to give back the loan, why don't they say to Anil Ambani? rahul gandhi ne kaha ki press vaale kehete hai, karja maaf kiya to aadat bighad jaaegi
 Didn't Mallya, Ambani, Mehul's habit deteriorate? If you spoil their habit, then we will spoil the habit of farmers

 hamane nirnay liya he ki nunatam vetan ke adhikaar kaa
 The Congress government is going to be formed in 2019
 
 After this, the government will pay the minimum wages directly to the poor of the country without any middlemen in their bank account
 itane bade desh main aisa pehali baar hoga or congress ise safaltaapurvak ise puraa karegi
 He said that the Congress is not against the industrialists
 ham kroni capatlism ke khilaaf hai
 
 jaise maalya, mehul, neerav modi
 He said that we are not the voice of an organization, we are the voice of 125 crore people
 ye hamamen or unamem antar he
 This is not the organization of Savarkar who begs the British
