 When he did not return home that day, the next day his family filed a missing report

 Concerned Kashmir University wrote a letter to the State Director General of Police (DGP) SP Vaidya asking him to locate Rafi
 lekin ravivaar kii subah hi, aakhirkaar apane pita ne rafee ke bare main bataaya- wo phone par tha, bolaa ki shopiyaan main funs gaya he
 Rafi was recently selected for the post of Assistant Professor at the University of Hyderabad, Rafi was the topper in the list of people who were selected for the post

 Bollywood has always shown the love of small towns wrapped in the syrup of romance
 or mujhe iske saath jeene kaa saubhaahgya mila he
 i have been a witness to this and have been part of many such love stories, to say with embarrassment, every time a matter of life and death! In my hometown Chandigarh, love is often "filmy"
 mumbai yadi kaam ke peeche bhaagane vaala he to chandigarh pyaar ke peeche
 After all, Punjabi musicians spend countless hours singing songs in praise of the women of Chandigarh? This desire to love is also related to the way the city is built
 iske vishaal park, khubasurat vaataavaran, prishthbhumi main pahaado kii chotiyaan or fursat ke lamhon ko jeene kii chahat kii vajah se yahaan pyaar se batch paanaa kathin he
 After living in a small city and loving it, as well as living in a big city like Mumbai, i can tell the difference between these two
 chote shaharon main thakaa dene vaali yatra nahin kerani padati, romantic mulakaaton ke liye koi simit weekend nahin hota or apane pyaar ke saath paseene se sarabor date par jane se pehle local trainon main rastebhar kareeb 20 logon ko gaali dete hue koi dhakka-mukki nahin kerani hoti
 The young men of my city, with time, money and love, declare any stranger woman as their own
 uske baad unke group kaa koi bhi anya vyakti us mahila kii tarif karne kaa bhi adhikaar nahin rakhata or vah ekatarfa us par marataa rahata he
 Certainly more people can remain a part of his group as long as they show respect for that official "sister-in-law"
 yah koi samajhane kii koshish nahin karata ki kahin ‘bhabhi’ khud kisi or mard ko dekhakar aahen to nahin bharateen!main ladakon ke aise group kaa hissaa rahaa hum, jisamen sabhi ek hi ladki ko pyaar karte the
 i acquired that girl like films and broke my heart too
 mujhe shahar ke prasiddh ‘geri root’ kii charchaa jarur kerani chahie: sector 10 or 11 ke bich kii is sadak par akasar yuva log pyaar kii talash main mandaraate the
 In Punjabi Indigenous terminology, 'geri' means short journey or ride
 is sadak par chalane vaale trephic main puri tarah upar se khuli jeepen, jinamein yuva ladke baithe hote the, khuli khidakiyon vaali chamakati kaaren or teji se bhaagti motorcykilon par savaar bina helmet vaale aakarshak munde hote the
 They would stun each other, attract others and many love stories would become from Nan Matkay
 main mumbai jaise bade shahar main aisi chizon kii kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa
 Punjab University is another great nursery of love, where Ishq Parwan climbs
 vahiin par tahiraa kashyap, meri patni, ke saath meraa pyaar phala-phula or sanyog se unke maa-baap ko bhi ek-duusare se vahiin par pyaar hua tha
 As a place that can emote more than a center of higher education, this very beautiful university offers unmatched opportunities for you to lose heart at every step
 kisi ko campus main vimen hostel kii pahchaan na kar paane ke liye maaf kiya ja saktaa he kyonki is baat kii puri sambhaavna hoti he ki uske baahar hostel main rahane vaali ladakiyon se zyada ladke dikhen
 But outside the main shopping plaza of Sector 17, the new and old love birds, softy-yes, the same wafer cone ice cream - will be seen raising the rings of love
 ham ab bhi ise khate hai or plane vanilla ab bhi meri pasand bana hua he
 But some of the attractions of the old world are actually fading now because media, films and consumerism now have more impact
 safalataa kii tarah hi ab pyaar kii prakruti bhi chanchal ho rahi he
 i hope that Chandigarh will retain its shine and our love for the feeling of being loved

 ' GST ke daayre main kin kaarobaaron ko shaamil kiya jaae or kise nahin, is ahm sawaal par rajya ab khul kar aamane saamne aa gayi hai

 dilli ke dariyaganj ilaake se do saptaah pehle baraamad kii gai ladki kii laash kaa maamla police ne sulajhaa liya he
 That girl named Sonia was murdered by two of her friends together
 police ne donon ko giraftaar kar liya he
 In this case, tattoos on the hands of deceased and accused alike proved to be important clues
 darasal, beeti 14 may kii raat dariyaganj thana police ne ditisi park se ekladki kii laashbramad kii thi
 Who was brutally slaughtered
 yahi nahin uski pahchaan mitaane ke liye kaatilon ne uskaa cheharaa pattharon se buree tarah se kuchal diya tha
 He had deep bruises on his head
 police jaan chuki thi ki katl shaatir tareeke se anjaam diya gaya he
 Because the murderer did not leave any evidence around the corpse to identify the girl who died
 jaahir tha ki kaatil behad shaatir the
 When the police examined the corpse, two tattoos were seen on the hand of the deceased
 haath par hindi main "rahul kumaar" or "soni yaa sozi" likhaa tha
 a long investigation began after this
 police ne aasapaas ke thanon main darj gumshudagi kii report khangaali lekin koi suraag nahin mila
 Then the police questioned more than 4 thousand people
 is poochtacha main police ke haath kuch suraag lage
 During this, the police also interrogated the rickshaw pullers and nearby pubs
 tab jaakar police ko pataa laga ki marane vaali ladki kaa naam sonia he
 After the identification of the deceased, the police made a list of all the friends and enemies of Sonia and started the interrogation one by one
 doston kii list main salmaan urf rahul or kaaliya bhi shaamil the
 Police found that they both had the same tattoo on their arm as Sonia's hand
 in donon ne apane haathon par SRK bhi gudwaya tha
 During interrogation, both of them said that they meant Sonia from S, Rahul from r and Kalia from K
 police ne jab sakhti se donon se poochtacha kii to donon ne katl kii kabool kar lee
 Police found out that the two boys worked with Sonia
 un donon ko shaq ho gaya tha ki sonia unhen dhokhaa de rahi he
 Actually, investigations have revealed that all these are related to the call girl racket
 phir kaaliya ne rahul ko uksaaya ki sonia chit kar rahi he, uske duusare logon se bhi sambandh hai
 Both drunk heavily on the night of 14 May
 phir bahaane se sonia ko apane saath lekar dariyaganj ke ditisi park main gaye or vahiin par berahami sesonia kaa qatlakar diya
 On the day Sonia was killed, the weather was extremely bad
 isliye police ko sisitivi footage se bhi suraag nahin mil paaya tha
 Now the police have arrested both the accused and sent them to jail
 shivasena ke baad ab endie kaa ek or ghatak dal telugu desham party bijepi kaa saath chhod sakati he
 The TDP has reacted strongly to the budget, calling it a hoax with the people of Andhra Pradesh
 saath hi party ne kendriya bajet ko janvirohi or kaarobaariyon ke liye hitkaari bataaya he
 The TDP is also said to be upset with the Centre's lax stance on giving special assistance to Andhra Pradesh
 sutron ke mutabik andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri or tidipi pramukh chandrababu naidu is bare main gambhirtha se vichaar kar rahe hai
 Naidu has also invited party members to discuss the issue on Sunday
 party ke paas loksabhaa main 16 saansad or rajyasabha main 6 saansad hai
 Naidu is not avoiding other options! Sources also do not deny that Naidu is considering other political options as well
 party janata se bhi is bare main raay le rahi he ki use 2019 tak bijepi ke saath rahanaa chahie yaa phir alag hokar chunaav ladanaa chahie
 a senior leader of the party seeking intervention from the PM said that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP had received 2 percent votes in Andhra, but in the next election, these votes can go up to 6 percent
 aise main party ko alag hone se pehle hone vaale is nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye yojana banani hogi
 Another party leader said that Naidu was angry and had even lodged his objection with the Prime Minister, but it did not have much effect, now if the PM interferes, the issue can be resolved
 tidipi ke ek anya netaa ne kaha ki ab kuch hi vikalp bache hai, unamem se ek he ki ham bijepi ko bataaen ki agar hamaari maang nahin maani jaati hai to tidipi cabinet se apane mantriyon ko waapas bula legi
 It is being told that Naidu is unhappy with the proper financial support for the state and the delay in approval of the pending schemes after the formation of Telangana
 hyderabad ke telugana main jane ke baad andhra rajasav kii baari dikkaton se jujh rahaa he
 Andhra plans in Adhar: a minister from TDP quota in the central government said that after discussions on the midnight of August 8, 2016, the Center had agreed to give a special package to Andhra Pradesh, after which TDP to withdraw the demand for separate state Was also ready
 lekin tab se rajya ko package kaa ek paisa bhi nahin mila he
 TDP says that there are many other demands such as making Visakhapatnam a zonal railway, clearances to the Kadapa steel plant, which are yet to be met
 tidipi pichley kuch maheenon se lagaataar apni sahyogi bijepi ko nishaanaa bana rahi he
 Meanwhile, YSR Congress Chief YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is also cashing in on this issue
 jagan pehle hi jaahir kar chuke hai ki agar centre andhra ko vishesh rajya kaa darja de to wo endie main shaamil hone ke liye taiyaar hai
 Looking for new partner! According to TDP sources, if BJP agrees to join hands with YSR Congress, Naidu has Plan b ready
 isamen plan ke tahat tidipi chote lekin prachlit dal jan sena ke saath gathbandhan kar sakati he, jo ki bijepi kii jagah tidipi ke liye ek behatar vikalp sabit hoga
 The rift in the alliance is not good news for the BJP
 dakshin main apni pahunch badhaane kii jugat main lagi bijepi tamilnadu, karnataka or andhra main sthaneey sahyogiyon ke bina aage nahin bad sakati
 Secondly, if the BJP leaves the TDP and joins the YSR Congress at this time, then it can go wrong because YSR chief Jagan is already surrounded by allegations of corruption

 com / vmeqyxn29u — Vicky Kaushal (@ vickykaushal09) February 8, 2019 Vicky Kaushal starrer film Uri The Surgical Strike made in a budget of just Rs 45 crores has grossed 230 crores till 22 February
 yadi sab kuch thik rahaa to yah 250 karod rupee kaa aankada paar kar jaaegi
 The film has been a total of 5 weeks at the box office but despite this the audience remains interested in this film
 film vaastavik ghatana par aadhaarit he
 Apart from this, the content and presentation of the film is also very strong
 film main vicky kaushal ke alaava paresh rawal, yami gautam, mohit raina jaise actors the
 The film is directed by Aditya Dhar
 rajasthan main pichley pakhwaade do bade badlaav hue
 Two individuals were evicted from their current status
 donon hi mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke kareebi rahe hai
 The changes happened when Raje went to Singapore for a business conference
 16 aktubar ko unke mukhya sachiv rajeev maharishi kaa tabadalaa kendriya vitt sachiv ke pad par dilli kar diya gaya or 10 aktubar ko unke puraane dost or ipiel ke purv kamishnar lalit modi ko rajasthan cricket association (aaarasie) ke adhyaksh pad se hataa diya gaya
 Amin Pathan, who overthrows Lalit by coup, is also loyal to Raje
 ve modi ke bhi sahaayak rahe hai
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is believed to be behind both the changes
 jetali or maharishi donon ke bahut achche sambandh hai
 Jaitley had long wanted to bring him with him
 haalanki jetali cricket ke maamalon main modi ke behad khilaaf rahe hai
 Maharishi was also once close to Modi
 lekin haal ke dinon main raaje kii tarah unhen bhi cricket maamalon main tatasth dekha gaya
 So if Jaitley was happy with the ouster of Modi, then Mahisha was transferred to the Finance Ministry? It is not a big deal for Maharishi to become Finance Secretary at the Center
 disambar,2013 main raaje kii ore se unhen apana mukhya sachiv banaakar laane se pehle ve rasayan or urvarak sachiv the hi
 He has also been Raje's successful finance secretary
 dilli main vitt sachiv ke bataur kaam karne ke baad cabinet sachiv banane ke liye daawa pesh karne main bhi unhen madad milegi
 Maharshi's term of service is to end in August 2015
 yadi ve cabinet sachiv ban gaye to unhen do saal kaa seva vistaar mil jayega
 But would the Prime Minister want to make a cabinet secretary who is considered close to Raje and Jaitley? However, it may also be part of a wider consensus between Raje and Narendra Modi in the coming years
 singapore ke liye ravaanaa hone se pehle raaje ne apane apratyaashit bayaan se khaasi halchal machaa di thi
 He had said that the credit of bjp's victory cannot be given to any one person
 haalanki raaje ne fouran safai di thi ki unka iraadaa pradhanmantri par nishaanaa sadhana nahin tha
 But such strategies are not new to negotiation in politics
 raaje ne lalit modi ke takhtapalat se jude vivaad se apane ko dur hi rakhaa he
 Modi's team, led by Mahmood Abdi, is fighting a court battle against Amin Pathan, who took over as the acting president of RCA
 pathan or lalit gut ke bich ladaai ne kuch maili sachaaiyon ko ujagar kiya he
 Pathan has accused the Lalit group of paying crores of rupees to the lawyers
 aarope ke mutabik yah fees kuch aise vakeelon ko bhi di gai jo jalmahal samjhaute ko supreme court se radd karwaane kii raaje kii koshish kaa virodh karne main aage the
 At the same time, Abdi alleged that the opponents coup because RCA stopped paying their travel and other expenses
 ve yah bhi kehete hai, ''jab hycourt ne bisisiai ko aaarasie ke binar kaa istemaal kiye bagaiyr rajasthan se khiladinnon ke chayan kaa nirdesh de diya tha, to pathan ne vidroh kyon kiya? '' pathan jor dekar kehete hai ki is baghawat ke peeche raaje yaa jetali kaa koi haath nahin he
 "lalit Modi failed to lift BCCI ban from RCA," he told India Today
 the
 They did not even answer our phone calls, we were all convinced by this
 cricket ko aage badhaane kaa yahi ek rasta tha ki modi ko hataaen or bisisiai kii manyata hasil karen
 "the withdrawal of these two close associates of Raje from the affairs of the state will only help
" maharishi ke centre main jane se ve rajya ke liye kuch or madad juta sakati hai
 Similarly, the removal of Lalit is good for state cricket
 bisisiai ne lalit ke netritv vaale aaarasie par pratibandh laga rakhaa he, jo ab ummid he ki hataa liya jayega
 On the other hand, it will also help bridge the distance between Raje and Modi — the distance seen by the inclusion of only one MP from the state in the Union Cabinet and even more by not making Raje's son Dushyant Singh a minister at the Center

 khaanaa khaane ke baad chaay pinaa adhiktar logon kii aadat main shaamil hota he lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki aapaki ye aadat aapaki sehat ko nuksaan pahunchaati he
 Some people say that they have a habit of drinking tea immediately after eating food, especially in winters, they always need tea after eating
 lekin aapako bataa den ki bhojan karne ke turant baadachaay pinaa sehatake liye katai acchhee baat nahin hai
 This is because tea leaves have acidic properties and when they combine with the protein of food, the protein becomes hard, which makes it difficult to digest
 isliye chaay kaa seven khaanaa khaane ke turant baad naa hi karen to acha hota he
 In addition, tea contains caffeine which increases blood pressure
 saath hi caffeine kii maatra sharir main cortisol yani ki steroid hormones ko badha detii he, jisase sharir ko kai prakaar kii samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 These include heart problems, diabetes and weight gain etc
 chaay main 'poliphenolls' or 'tennins' aadi tatv hote hai joki sharir ke liye bhojan se aayran ko sokhne nahin dete hai
 Especially for women who are deficient in iron, drinking tea after eating is harmful
 yadi aap chaay yaa coffee ke bina rah hi nahin sakate hai to kam se kam bhojan ke ek ghante baad inkaa seven karen

 After demonetisation, many body elections were held in the country
 zyaadaatar main faisla bijepi ke paksh main aayaa
 But the biggest decision came from the financial capital Mumbai on Thursday
 pehali baar yahaan akele chunaav lard rahi bijepi duusari sabase badi party ban kar ubhari
 The BJP, which won just 31 seats in an alliance with the Shiv Sena five years ago, is single-handedly occupying 81 wards this time
 yahi nahin, puure maharashtra main bijepi ne shandaar pradarshan karte hue 10 main se 8 palikaon par apana dabadabaa bana liya he
 The benefit of fighting alone was voted on Tuesday for the BJP Kobmc ie Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation
 nateezon ne saaf kar diya he ki bijepi ko baar-baar aankh dikhaa rahi shivasena bhi apane dam par biemasi par kabiz nahin ho sakegi
 Like the assembly elections, the Shiv Sena fought separately and tried to capture Mumbai but the BJP benefited in this decision
 bijepi ne pichhali baar sirf 69 siton par chunaav ladaa tha
 But this time it did not contest all the seats
 BMC ko bhi saath pasand he, akele raaj nahin kar paaengi shivasena or bijepiudhav thakare ko le dubi jidashivsena bhale hi 84 siten jitkar sabase badi party bani ho lekin agar pichley chunaavon se uski is jeet kii tulana kii jaae to nattejey party ke liye jashn manaane laayak to katai nahin hai
 Last time i
e
 in 2012 BMC election, Shiv Sena contested 158 seats and won 75 seats
 is baar sabhi siton par chunaav ladane ke baavjood wo mahaj 84 siten jeet pai
 Uddhav was adamant on giving just 60 seats to the BJP this time but he won 81 seats
 2012 main bijepi ne 69 siton par chunaav ladane ke baad 32 par jeet hasil kii thi
 This time she was seeking 114 seats
 jeet kaa kya hoga siyaasi asarabiemasi main bijepi kii record siten or puure maharashtra main uskaa shandaar pradarshan bataata he ki rajya main uski pakad vidhansabha chunaav kii tarah majboot he
 If the Shiv Sena wants power happiness, it will have to join hands with the BJP in the BMC and continue to support the Fadnavis government in the state as well
 iske alaava bijepi par ek seemaa ke baahar jaakar uske hamale bhi ab beeti baat ho jaaenge
 Yes, but if Uddhav chooses a different path, then neither will he have any role in Mumbai, Maharashtra nor Maharashtra

 ye sab bijepi ke chunaav prachaar kaa ek hissaa he
 The BJP is rolling out new prescriptions for the MCD elections in Delhi, one of which is the Nukkad drama
 nukkad naatak ke liye dilli bijepi ne profeshnal kalakaaron kii ek puri team taiyaar kii he, jo dillibhar main alag-alag jagahon par bijepi kaa prachaar karegi
 To give a new color to the campaign, the BJP has found an interesting way, for this, small stories have been written on the burning issues of Delhi and scenes have been prepared based on these stories, which will come in the form of a street theater
 
 zaahir he ki kahaniyon ke centre main dilli kii aam aadmi party kii sarkaar he or nishane par dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal
 All these characters are made up of different street plays, which are decorated with interesting dialogues
 prachaar kaa kaamkaaj dekh rahe bijepi netaa narendra tandon ke mutabik nukkad naatak ke zarie jin muddon par bijepi ne kejariwal or unki sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish kii he, wo aise mudde hai, jo pehle se hi media or janata main charchaa main he, jinamein vigyapanon par sarkari khajaane se kharchaa karne, apane vidhayakon ko revadiyaan baantne, vidhayakon par aapraadhik maamle, bijli-pani kii pareshaani or gaadi bangala istemaal na karne kii baat karke sari suvidhaayen bhogane jaise mudde shaamil hai
 a similar street play depicts the historic victory of the Aam Aadmi Party and then the fake degree of the minister, the removal of the minister due to corruption, allegations of rape, 21 cases related to parliamentary secretaries, in which the ghost of corruption has been made and It has been shown that Delhi is troubled by the ghosts of the scam of the Kejriwal government
 jab in bhuton ko modi kii photo dikhaayi jaati he, to ek-ek karke saare bhoot bhaag khadey hote hai
 Now the BJP is trying to expose the Kejriwal government through these street plays, the party hopes that what they have said through speeches and posters will be able to easily explain the things to the voters through street plays
 maujuuda samay main gracuty kii samay seemaa 5 saal hesima 5 saal se ghataakar 1 saal karne kii taiyaarimodi sarkaar jald hi naukareepesha logon ko badi khushkhabari de sakati he
 Especially those working in the private sector will benefit greatly from this move of the government
 khabar he ki sarkaar soshal security and gracuty ke niyamon main badlaav karne kii taiyaari main he
 Actually, to be eligible for gratuity, one has to work in a company for at least 5 consecutive years
 lekin sarkaar isamen badlaav kar aam naukareepesha logon ko raahat dene kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Presently, according to gratuity reports, the government wants to reduce the 5-year time for gratuity to just one year

 Let me tell you, those people who change jobs after one year will benefit the most

 Private employees will be of great benefit, however, no official announcement has been made by the government so far
 bataa den, maujuuda samay main gracuty kii samay seemaa 5 saal he
 Gratuity is a type of amount paid to employees, which gives extra benefits to the employees

 In a way, it is expressed by giving the employee in return for the service provided to the company
 isaki adhiktam seemaa 20 lakh rupee hoti he
 At present, gratuity is granted to an employee only when he works in a company for five years
 haalanki mrityu yaa aksham ho jane par gracuty amount die jane ke liye naukari ke 5 saal puure hona jaruri nahin he
 There is a provision for gratuity within 30 days for the employer to leave, retire, die or become incapacitated
 agar tay avadhi ke andar aisa nahin hota he to baad main imploir ko sarkaar dwaara tay byaaj ke saath gracuty amount kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 This is how gratuity depends on two factors, how much gratuity you will get
 pehla, aapane company main kitni saalon tak seva kii
 Second, depending on your last salary
 isamen seva ke har saal kii aakhri selary ke 15 dinon ke hisaab se calculation kiya jaataa he
 Your basic and dearness allowance is included in the salary

 His last salary was 20 thousand rupees
 (15X20,000X20) / 26 = 2,30,769 rupee
 In such a situation, the amount of his gratuity will be Rs 2 lakh 30 thousand 769

 Read this new story of Suryanath Singh on literature Aaj Tak kahaneh tarikhi talab- suryanath singhgarami shuru hone ko thi
 It had been two days since Holi
 subah ke das baje honge
 Chatti had gathered at his favorite places
 aasapaas ke gaanvon se logon kaa kisi kaam se aana-janaa laga hua tha
 Put a flower on the shoulder or tie it on the head, rubbing the khaini in the donkey
 unamem se kaiyon kii dhul chuki baniyaan yaa kurte-dhoti par holi ke rang ab bhi apni chhap liye saaf dikh rahe the
 Schools were opened, but instead of going to school, the meeting master was sitting on a newspaper bench or something, sitting at the Jayanath confectionery
 jayanath sadaa kii tarah in sab baton ko sunata, ansuna karata, koyala dhadhakane, chaay ubaalane or graahakon ko nipataane main vyast tha
 However, there were many people who visited his shop, who neither had to drink tea nor buy anything
 ve bas akhbaar kaa jo panna haath lag jaae, uski khabar baanchate or chalate banate yaa phir baithkbaj mastaron, gaanv ke fursatiya navhon ke bich kuch der baith dilli, lakhanu, patna yaa america-britain vagairah kii kisi samasya par maathaa takaraate or tarak jate
 There was a similar atmosphere that day
 akhbaar main dedh saal baad hone vaale aam chunaav kaa sameekaran chapa tha
 In it again, the assessment of the formation of the government of the ruling Rajpa i
e
 National Public Interest Party was presented
 logon kii smriti main yah pehali baar tha, jo akhabaaron main itnaa pehle aam chunaav ko lekar raishumaari aane lagi thi
 Simply, people had got plenty of spice to give their opinion, debate
 hamaare desh main logon ko chunaav kaa sameekaran haath lag jaae, to unki rashan-pani, haari-bimaari sabaki chintaa bisar jaati he
 The master master gives such knowledge on such occasions that if the government and political parties listen, then start thinking of changing their strategy
 so, chal rahi thi usee par chakallas
 Perhaps some people had summoned tea from Jayanath, so he was repeatedly raising his aluminum pan from the furnace, stirring it to cool and cook the scorched tea
 sadaa kii tarah, vah logon kii baaten-bahasein sunate hue bhi apni koi pratikriya nahin de rahaa tha
 Jayanath was an entertaining and unique character
 aisa nahin ki use duniya-jahaan kii jaankaree nahin yaa akhbaar main chape samaacharon par uski koi raay nahin
 But he was often serious and silent
 ikyavan-baawan kii umr
 Half-sleeved shirt and lungi or trousers made by cutting half pants would continue to work
 us din bhi laga tha
 Jayanath's clients are fixed, as they are and will live from birth
 jayanath ke pita dhaniram ne is chatti par chaay kii dukaan shuru kii thi, jab yah sadak nai-nai bani thi or gaanvon main chaay pine kaa chalan nahin tha
 But people used to come to buy pakoras, pickled boiled chickpeas, samosas, jalebi, besan sev-dalmoth, khaja-khajuli, laddu-tikri etc
 tab din bhar main do hi sarkari basen us sadak par chalati thim
 So, only a few people used to come and go
 magar dhaniram ne chaay kii dukaan khole rakhi
 Whatever the reason for this
 ho saktaa he, dhaniram ne kisi ke khet main hal kii muthia pakadaney ke bajaay apana yah kaam karnaa behatar samajha ho
 Or were they so far-sighted that they had a feeling that as time passed, it would be rocky and this store would be a support for their future generations
 so, dhaniram ghate-munaafe ke ganit main uljhe bagaiyr chatti par date rahe
 He brought his family from a nearby village and started living in the roadside shanty there
 dhaniram date rahe or saath main apane iklaute bete jayanath ko bhi lagaae rakhaa
 In this way Jaynath was born an employee of his father's tea shop
 subah uthte hi uskaa sabase pehla kaam hota, bhatthi main koyala bhar kar use dhadhakana
 He would wake up in the morning, rubbing his eyes and blinking coal, full of smoke in his eyes and became fully conscious
 koyala dhadhakane ke baad vah paas ke pokhar main nahaane jaataa or phir laut kar skool jane ko taiyaar ho jaataa
 Dhaniram wanted Jayanath to learn his work, but did not remain illiterate like him
 so, ve use skool bhejte the
 Jayanath retired from school after VIII and took over the tea shop at Chatti
 dhaniram jab tak jinda the, vahi dukaan ke mukhiya rahe, par bete ko unhone nae-nae prayog karne kii puri aazaadee de di thi
 Slowly, the road started moving, the rocket started moving
 dhaniram kii dukaan par graahak bhi badhane lage
 Seeing the tea business growing, another man opened a tea shop some distance away
 phir saal bitate-na-bitate ek or dukaan khul gai
 That is, competition started increasing in Dhaniram's business
 chatti par dukaane badhati raheen, par jayanath kii dukaan sabase maukey kii jagah yani prime lokation par basii thi, so vahaan graahak zyada jame rahete
 At the same time Jayanath changed the 'recipe' of tea
 chaay pakaane ke baad vah usamen graahakon se chipa kar thodaa-sa coffee powder daalane laga
 In this way, tea made by Jayanath was separated from the rest of the shops in that Chatti
 jo ek baar jayanath ke haath kii bani chaay pi letaa, use duusari dukaan kii chaay pasand nahin aati
 Initially, when the taste of Jayanath's tea started to feel different, there were various types of discussions about it
 koi kahata, jayanath chaay main opium milaataa he, jisaki aadat pad jaati he or jo ek baar uski chaay pi letaa he, baar-baar vahi pinaa chahta he
 There is no doubt that it would have been Jayanath's rival shopkeepers to spread the rumor and then be aired by some of his jealous customers
 par yah afvaah bahut kaam nahin ai
 Those who used to sit regularly at his shop, make newspapers, talk and debate, remained his shop
 dhaniram jab tak jinda rahe, na unhone, na jayanath ne kabhi kisi graahak kii khushaamad kii, na hadak-hanak sahi
 Kept shoplifting with full vigor
 bahesane-batiyaane waalon kii baaten main ve kabhi nahin aae
 Yes, they used to listen to everyone, but they rarely used to express their views on instigation
 is tarah ve niraa budhu samajhe jate- duniya-jahaan kii baton se bekhbar
 But in fact Jaynath was not like this
 vah aathvin paas jarur tha, par bahut saare maamalon main achche-achche padhe-likhon ke kaan kaat saktaa tha
 When he made a comment, people would look at him - of course laugh at him for a long time
 in dinon to, jabase desh digital hua tha or jayanath ne chini smartphone liya tha, vah fasebuk or watsap par bhi sakriy ho gaya tha
 There he would give his thoughts to Bellaus
 iske alaava pataa nahin kaise use ek khabt samaa gai thi- angreji bolne kii
 He not only used English words deliberately in his conversation, but would also feel free to speak half-and-a-half sentences
 yah kahana to mushkil he ki shahrati dukandaaron kii tarah usne vishwa bazaar main jagah banane kii ranneeti ke tahat angreji siikhnaa-bolnaa shuru kiya hoga
 But there was born a cottage to prove himself knowledgeable or superior by speaking English
 haalanki uske adhakachari angreji bolne kaa log majaak hi udaate
 Often some furthestia nineties used to ask him to speak English and then he would laugh for a long time after listening
 par isse jayanath ke angreji bolne par viraam nahin laga
 And his English speaking came in handy that day
 shaayad uske angreji gyaan kii pariksha lene ke liye hi khud vidya kii devi saraswati ne us angrej jode ko uski dukaan par bheja tha
 On the morning of the morning, when the mob gathered at the shop of Jayanath, an Enfield Bullet motorcycle stopped there
 us par savaar gori chamadi ke firangi purush or mahila ne motorcycle dukaan kii bagal main khadi kii thi or sir se helmet utaar kar sidhaa dukaan par aae the
 Both wore half-leg pants and a t-shirt like Sando vest
 unhen dukaan par aayaa dekh fursatiyon kii chakallas ruk gai
 Everyone was sitting there looking left
 sabaki nigahen donon firangiyon ke sir se lekar paanv tak upar-neeche hone lagi thim, jaise salmaan khan ke das kaa dam main sawaalon kaa sahi uttar bataane se pehle mashin kii sui der tak upar-neeche hoti rahati he
 The Firangi couple was probably used to staring at people like this, so it did not become uncomfortable at all
 firangi mahila ne aage badhate hue donon haath jode or vahaan baithe sabhi logon ko sambodhit karte hue boli- ‘namaste!’uske jawaab main kai swar ek saath ubhare- ‘namaste namaste
 After seeing him, Jayanath could not understand for a while that the English people were really seated at his shop, but he had become enlightened in a moment
 vah tatpar hua or ek chaowkee par baithe fursatiyon ko lagbhag hadakaate hue aadesh diya- ‘hatie hatie, gibh ispesh tu mehmaan log
 
 
 
 kam kam shar, kam mem
 
 
 Shit Shit
 
 
 
 'when Jayanath tried to talk more politely or to give serious knowledge on some serious issue, he used to start speaking like this
 ek bench par baithe teen-chaar log munh baae firangiyon ko dekhte hue yantravat uth kar khadey ho gaye
 Jayanath dusted the bench with a towel placed on his shoulder and seated the Firangi guests with great warmth
 phir unke aage haath baandhe khadaa ho gaya or haath se dukaan par rakhe kaanch ke bakse kii taraf ishaara karte hue bade aatmavishvaas or apanepan se kaha- ‘plis tech tii
 
 
 No
 
 
 tech
 
 
 What do they say 
 
 chanaa
 
 
 Gram knob
 
 
 
 Bheri Shwadisht
 
 
 an
 
 
 Bheri Teshti 
 
 
 Bheri beneficial
 
 
 
 The Firangi looked towards each other, smiled almost laughably and Firangan raised two fingers and said- 'sirf do chai
 ’jayanath fatafat bhatthi ke paas pahunchaa or dhulaa hua bhagona uthaa kar usamen dher sara doodh or thodaa pani daal kar ubaalane laga
 Turning towards the Firangi, he asked- 'taking some ginger?' This time, Firangi smilingly replied - 'OK
 ’is bich firangan ne peeth par latake apane bag se bada-sa camera nikaal liya or vahaan baithe logon kii tasviren khinchne lagi thi
 Firangi asked- 'what is the name of this village?'
 
 
 ’ vahaan baithe ek masterji ne hindi main jawaab dene kii koshish kii to jayanath ne baat lapak lee- ‘dish ij dahacor chatti shar ji
 Firangi shook his neck and accepted the answer
 phir poocha- ‘yahaan dekhane kaa kya cheez?’is sawaal par vahaan baithe log ek-duusare kaa munh dekhne lage
 There was no such thing worth seeing, about which the British could be proudly told
 idhar kabhi angrej is tarah sailaani ban kar aae bhi nahin ki logon ko pataa chale ki angrejon ko kya cheez dekhne main dilchaspee he
 Tourists usually return to Varanasi, Sarnath and return
 isliye logon ko hairaani ho rahi thi ki yah firangi joda bhatakate hue idhar kaise aa gaya
 But the Firangi Purush had to answer the question, so a master replied - 'khet-barn, village-girgaon
 
 
 
 And then laughed
 magar jayanath ko laga ki jawaab thik se nahin diya gaya
 The British would not have come so far to see fields, barns, villages and villages
 usne jawaab diya- ‘dish ij bheri aitihashik ilaaka shar ji
 
 
 
 meni mughal raja vaaj hear
 
 
 
 lard cornvaalish vaaj hear
 
 
 
 shi lard cornvaalish kabr na in dishtric shiti?
 
 
 "yes, we saw that
" 
 
 
 what else?
 
 
 ’ firangi purush ne kaha
 Firangan was busy taking photos around
 bich-bich main firangi purush kii baaten bhi sun leti or muskaraa detii
 Then further
 
 
 seven
 
 
 Eight kilometers 
 
 nath mandir
 
 
 Bhrigu Temple, forty-fifty Kilometer
 
 
 
 You know no Bhrigu
 
 
 mahaan jyotishi
 
 
 No
 
 
 bas
 
 
 
 or nathing
 Jayanath replied
 is bich aasapaas se or bhi log aa jute the
 The villagers had got the time to cut the stuff, then the villagers had a wonderful view
 khaasi bheed ikattha ho gai thi
 Everyone's eyes were floating on her umbrellas and open legs, posing in a tshirt like Firangan's sando vest
 navhe ek duusare ko kuhani maar-maar kar unhen dekhne kaa ishaara or apana sukh jaahir kar rahe the
 But his happiness was not fully reflected
 jayanath do kaanch kii gilaason main chaay bhar kar le aayaa tha
 Seeing his color, it was clear that he had poured out all his love and skills in it
 firangan bhi tasviren utaarna band kar chaay pine aa gai thi
 The two-faced couple was drinking tea and the crowd stood in a circle surrounded by curiosity, amazement, curiosity, longing etc
 tabhi motorcycle par peeche ek navhe ko bithaae or teen-chaar motorcykilon par pichhalguon kaa kafila liye shobhit thakur vahaan prakat hue
 Shobhit Thakur i
e
 District President of Yuva Morcha of National Public Interest Party- Rajpa
 garmi ho, sardi yaa barsaat, safed kurta-pajame par rangeen bandi or gale main chamakili dhari kaa gamchaa dhaare rahete
 One hundred and one round Kalava in right hand wrist and thick red tilak on forehead
 sir par hameshaa tote kii chonch jaisi parachhatti nikali topi jamaaye
 The same hat, which the British or urban people wear while playing polo
 shobhit thakur ne jayanath kii dukaan ke aage bheed jami dekhi to motorcycle roak di
 Holding the handle of the motorcycle, bowed the waist, lengthened the neck and raised the peak of paan on the right side
 phir bache hue paan ko ek taraf set kiya or sawaal daaga- ‘kaise bheed laga rakhi he, bhai?’‘are aaie aaie shobhit baau
 
 
 , Bidesi guests have come, want to see the surrounding places here
 ’ ek master ji ne utsahit hokar bataaya
 But Shobhit Thakur did not get off the motorcycle
 thodi der kuch sochaa
 He talked to himself in his mind
 turant unke bheetar koi vichaar kaundha yaa phir barason se pal rahaa koi vichaar saakaar hone ko machal uthaa
 There was reassurance on his face and he sat there on the motorcycle and said - 'hello Gentleman
 kam kam, kam hear
 
 
 
 ’firangi jode ne shobhit thakur kii taraf dekha
 By his attire and style of speaking, he must have guessed that he is a typical person of this area
 so, haath main chaay kaa gilaas thame donon uth kar shobhit thakur ke paas pahunche
 The crowd also became circular there
 ‘fram hwat country kaming?’ shobhit thakur ne paan gulgulaate hue poocha
 'from Yugoslavia
 ’ firangi purush ne muskaraate hue jawaab diya
 'okay
 in america aar england?’ shobhit thakur kaa doosraa sawaal
 'no no, it's Yugoslavia
 ’‘anderstand anderstand
 
 
 Not next to London
 
 
 
 So, do you want places of heire? " ’ firangi purush ne muskaraate hue kaha
 'okay
 ai vil so you plasces
 
 
 
 kam kam
 
 
 "what is important here?" The Firangi man asked, keeping an empty glass of tea
 phir usne jayanath kii taraf mukhaatib hokar poocha- ‘kitna paisa?’jayanath ne donon haath hilaate hue kaha- ‘no no, no mani
 
 
 
 you aar maai mehmaan log?
 
 
 i don't take money from guests
 
 
 
 'but Firangi forcefully placed a fifty rupee note in Jayanath's hand and said with a smile -' You are very good man
 
 
 
 And your English is very good
 ’jayanath abhibhoot tha
 Now Shobhit Thakur understood that there would be no need for needless English Gitpitane
 firangi joda hindi samaj letaa he
 So, they started in Hindi
 ‘aaie, mere saath chaliye, main aapako dikhaata hum yahaan jo kuch dekhne laayak he
 Shobhit Thakur said and parked the motorcycle aside
 baaki pichhalguon ne bhi jahaan-tahaan motorcycilen khadi kar deen
 Then Shobhit Thakur led the Firangi to the pokhar and temple behind Jayanath's shop
 pichhalgue or bheed bhi unke peeche lag lee
 Shobhit Thakur began to explain - 'this land is the land of heroes and ascetics
 yahaan bade-bade siddh purush hue
 There were warriors one by one
 hamaara distic headqwater bahut purana shahar he
 
 
 
 yah dharti aitihaasik he
 
 
 
 aap saidpur bhitari jaaie, vahaan yahaan ke aitihaasik saakshyon kaa ek sangrahalay he
 Looking at it, you can guess how much this earth has contributed in history
 
 
 
 "we saw that tow
" 
 
 
 The Firangi Purush said
 ‘good
 Shobhit Thakur was pleased
 pokhar aa gaya tha
 Drought for years, puddle of weeds
 pehle is pokhar main log nahaaya karte the
 Clean water used to be filled throughout the year
 par ab gaad na nikaali jane, dekhbhaal thik se na ho paane kii vajah se vah uthlaa hote-hote suukh gaya tha
 In it, plastic glass-plate-cloth and all the garbage was being put in the shops of Chatti shops
 magar shobhit thakur ne us pokhar kaa mahimamandan shuru kiya to logon kii ankhen fatty kii fatty rah gayi
 He started raising his hand and saying - 'this is the Mauryan Pokhara
 
 
 
 It was built by the great emperor Chandragupta Maurya
 
 
 
 See its ghat
 iskaa sthapaty dekhie
 In a time when cement and brick were not in practice, this ghat was built
 isaki seedhiyaan kam se kam sau feet bheetar tak gai hai
 It was made by crushing headlines and white pebbles
 
 
 
 See, how many hundred years have passed, but this ghat remains as it is
 
 
 
 Our elders say that an inscription was also placed in that corner of this ghat, on which the name and its message of the king who built Pokhar was inscribed
 
 
 
 But we are so careless in the matter of protecting our culture that the inscription was not appreciated at all
 vah tut-foot kar kahin kho gaya yaa kisi patharkatwa ne use kaat kar sil-lodha bana daalaa
 That inscription is now simply a part of Janashruti
 uske bare main ab hamaari peedi ke bahut kam logon ko pataa hoga
 
 
 
 isi tarah hamaari mahaan sabhyataa or samskruti ke bahut saare nishaan mit gaye
 Some invaders were wiped out, some by our own people
 
 
 
 Sadly, there is not much enthusiasm in our generation about our culture
 
 
 
 If you write about it, then it will be recorded in Pokhar history
 
 
 
 Saying this, Shobhit Thakur swung his neck and deposited paan's drink once again
 firangi mahila pokhar kii tasviren utaarti ja rahi thi
 He took pictures of Pokhar Ghat from different angles - from far, near
 phir shobhit thakur ke saath firangi purush or saath main jamaa ho gai bheed kii tasviren khinchati rahi
 Shobhit Thakur's followers were also behind this matter
 unhone apane mobile phonon ke camere khol liye the or firangi jode kii tasviren khinchne lage the
 He had landed several pictures of the Firangi couple with Shobhit Thakur standing on the ghat without taking care of garbage, dirt and dirt
 phir shobhit thakur firangi jode ko pokhar se aage le chale
 Towards the temple
 unhone baat aage badhaai- ‘yah mandir is pokhar se bhi pehle kaa he
 Look, see its design
 isamen rakhi murtiyon dekhie
 Look at this statue of Hanuman ji - with the Dronagiri mountain on his palm, the windmill flying in the air and the arrow with the arrow on it, the idol is the only one in the world
 
 
 
 You will not find this myth anywhere
 kahin or aisi murti aapako nahin milegi
 
 
 
 ’ phir unhone donon haath jod kar mandir ke devataaon ko pranaam kiya
 The Firangi couple was listening intently to everything Shobhit Thakur
 firangan tasviren khinche ja rahi thi
 Shobhit Thakur then moved towards the well built at some distance
 kuan saalon pehle suukh chukaa tha, par uskaa chabutara or jagat maujuud the
 Some peepal plants had definitely grown by breaking the walls of the well and now they wanted to become trees
 kuen kii taraf ishaara karke shobhit thakur ne bataaya- ‘yah kuna bhi mauryalin he
 
 
 
 or yahaan ke logon kii veerta dekhie ki in aitihaasik dharoharon ko mughalon ke atyaachaar se bachaae rakhaa
 You know how the Mughals came to our country and tried to destroy our ancient civilization and culture
 magar is dharti ke veeron ne apni ek bhi dharohar kii taraf usiki aankh tedi nahin hone di
 
 
 
 ’firangan ne us kuen kii bhi kai tasviren utaarin
 These things were worth showing there, so Shobhit Thakur showed them and went back to Jayanath's shop
 chalate-chalate firangi purush ne sawaal kiya- ‘yahaan mughal period kaa bhi koi sthapaty he?’sawaal sun kar shobhit thakur kii ankhen chaudee huin, bhrikuti tan gai, par unhone palak jhapakate hi khud ko sanyat kiya or chehre par muskaan bikharate hue bole- ‘nahin
 
 
 
 aap jis kshetra main khadey hai, vahaan bilkul nahin he
 
 
 
 yahaan mughal aae jarur honge, kyonki unke vanshaj yahaan bahut hai, par koi aitihaasik dastavej unke jamaane kaa yahaan maujuud nahin he
 
 
 
 rahaa bhi hoga, to yahaan ke vir swabhimani logon ne use mitaa daalaa hoga
 
 
 
 ’‘to, kya yahaan hindu-musalmaan kaa jhagada bahut he?’shobhit thakur kii bhauhen phir se tan gai
 Talkhi was stretched on her face
 par unhone ek baar phir khud ko sanyat kiya
 Mind you, the Firangi couple has actually gone in search of historical sites or to find the roots of communal quarrels
 apane aap se baaten kii- sasur, aajkal duniya bhar main sampradayikta par baaten karnaa fishan ban gaya he
 Many like this
 
 
 apane aap ko bauddhik sabit karne main jute hai
 
 
 
 khayr, in gori chamadi waalon kaa bhram to dur karnaa hi he
 Again
 
 
 
 He got leisure by talking to himself in a moment and said - 'how can you say that! 
 
 koi aisa jhagada nahin he
 There is no tension between the two communities
 
 
 
 If we were not tolerant, in this way, many villages, towns and cities in the entire district named after Muslims would have been wiped out
 jin gaanvon main ek bhi musalmaan nahin rahata, unke bhi naam kisi musalmaan shaasha, kisi musalmaan alaan-falaan ke naam par rakhe hue hai
 
 
 
 koi kaise kah saktaa he ki yahaan jhagada rahata he?
 
 
 There is no quarrel
 
 
 
 All live together ’firangi purush ne shobhit thakur ke lahaze se andaja laga liya ki sawaal kuch tedha ho gaya
 Still, he asked the next question- 'have there ever been any hindu-muslim opinion in this area? 
 
 koi danga nahin hua?’‘nahin
 never
 sab saath mil kar rahete hai
 
 
 
 sab ek-duusare ke sukh-dukh main saath dete hai
 
 
 
 ’‘magar hamane kitab main parhaa ki fau main to kai baar danga hua?’‘bahut saalon se vahaan bhi nahin hua
 The previous governments used to be behind the riots there
 tushtikaran kii raajnneeti karne vaale dalon kaa haath hua karata tha
 Now it is over
 
 
 or aap aane vaale saalon main dekhenge ki desh main kahin bhi koi is tarah kaa danga hone hi nahin paaegaa
 
 
 
 ’‘bahut-bahut dhanyavad aapkaa
 Firangi raised his hand with a smile, while Shobhit Thakur also put his hands forward, with a winning smile on his face
 der tak haath hilaate rahe or poocha- ‘yor good nem?’‘francis
 
 
 Francis Beckum
 ’ firangi purush ne jawaab diya
 'and Madam?' Shobhit Thakur raised his neck and asked, pointing with eyes towards Firangan
 ‘eliana
 When Firangan heard his name, he too put his hand forward
 shobhit thakur ne firangi kaa haath chhod firangan kaa haath pakad liya or us par apni duusari hatheli bhi jamaa di
 Holding his hand in both his hands for a long time and said with a feverish feeling - 'good feeling to meet you
 
 
 
 You are very good
 
 
 
 i am proud
 
 
 shobhit thakur
 President Youth Wing of National Public Interest Party
 
 
 
 He kept holding Firangan's hand and took pictures from his mobile phone
 firangan ne thank you bol kar haath chhudaaya, tab kahin use mukti mili
 'nice to Meet You Too'
 ’ firangan ne kaha
 Then again and again shaking hands, folded hands, Shobhit Thakur rode on his motorcycle and threw the key in it and gave the final advice- 'now if we go forward about ten kilometers from here, Nath Baba's temple will be found
 vah bhi aitihaasik mandir he
 Do check it out 
 
 
 Today is an important meeting of the organization in the distic headquarters, i am getting late, otherwise i would have taken you there
 
 
 
 bye Bye
 
 
 ’firangi jode ne bhi apane haath jode or dhanyavad kehete hue apni motorcycle sambhaal lee
 Then Shobhit Thakur with his convoy moved towards south and added Firangi towards north
 peeche baithi firangan dur tak haath hilaati by-by bolti rahi
 When the three went to Firangi, there also began to be a huge crowd
 magar jayanath kii dukaan par baithne vaale fursatiya navhon or mastaron ne phir vahaan deraa jamaa liya
 The chatter about Firangan's dress and limbs started, and lasted for a long time, the body and the body
 phir baat mudi to shobhit thakur par aa tiki
 'aho Master Saheb, Saidpur inner, there are the remains of the Gupta period, right?' While shaking the lime in Khaini on Gadori, the Furasatia headmaster of the primary school asked the Furasatia headmaster of the middle school
 ‘haa, vahaan likhaa to yahi he
 The headmaster of the middle school solved the doubts
 ‘us hisaab se agar is pokhara ko bhi maane to ise guptakaleen kah sakate hai
 
 
 
 phir shobhit thakur ise mauryalin kaise bataa rahe the?’ primary skool ke headmaster kii shankaa bani hui thi
 'you may have forgotten
 hamaara itihaas he bhi to ulajhaa hua, usamen gupt or mauryaal ko lekar ho gai hogi koi galatfahami
 The middle school headmaster clarified
 ‘lekin ham to sunate aae hai ki i pokhara satagawaan ke logon ne saramdan karke khoda tha or rajbali raay ke pardada ne iskaa ghat banwaaya tha
 
 
 
 is baat se to ham anjaan hi the ki hamaari bagal main aitihaasik dharohar he
 The village headman expressed his surprise from the neighboring village
 ‘hum
 
 
 This unique information was revealed today
 
 
 
 Today the history of this puddle has changed
 
 
 
 The headmaster of the primary school, clapping Khaini's neck, said
 ‘aise hi ek din ye puure desh kaa itihaas badal denge, dekhte rahiye
 Jaynath remarked while trying to calm down the swollen tea by lifting the bhagona
 is tippanee par sabaki hansi foot padi
 Then a young man shouted to Jayanath - 'hey Jainath bhaiya, did you really read with Shobhit Thakur?' Jayanath did not respond, then the headmaster of the Primary School started speaking on his behalf- 'oh yes brother, in this Who is suspicious? Both have studied up to class VIII
 aathvin ke baad jayanath ne yah dukaan sambhaal lee or shobhit aage padhane lage
 But the friendship remained
 ’‘shobhit thakur kahaan tak padhe hai?’ navhe ne jigyaasa prakat kii
 Hanged in twelfth
 do baar diya parichha, par paar nahin ho paae
 Then his babuji married and took the edge
 ’‘phir netaa kaise bane?’‘netaa banane ke liye koun-sa imtahaan dena padataa he? bhagya main likhaa tha bananaa, so ban gaye
 
 
 
 biyah ho gaya tha, kheti-baari main man to lagata nahin tha, so yaheen chatti par ek dukaan khole- uria bechney kii
 There was no earning in it, so spent a few days, then stopped
 uske baad kuch din cement bechaa
 That business too did not go on
 
 
 
 He should say that three years ago, when the younger brother got recruited in the army, the misery of the house went away and Shobhit Thakur's wings opened
 do saal pahile bhai kii shaadi kii or dahej main motorcycle mili, to ye ganthne lage uski sawari
 
 
 
 charfar aadmi to shuru se the, madan babu ke paas uthte-baithte the, unke saath gaanv-gaanv ghoomte, chunaav prachaar karte the
 This is how leaders became
 ab dekho, party kii kismat jaagi, to inaki bhi jaag gai
 Became Chairman of District Youth Committee
 ab har samay das-bees navhe aage-peeche ghoomte hai
 The court takes place in the morning and evening
 
 
 
 'saying this, Master ji pressed a khaini and pressed under the lower lip
 ‘jainath bhaiya bekaare unase duuri banaae rahete hai! unki party kaa virodh karte rahete hai
 Had he been with them, he would have made progress today
 
 
 
 Nowadays, there is no time to hold a party after seeing ideology
 jahaan apana phayda ho, kaam sadhe, vahiin sat lijie
 Take the party and you have to fight elections a little bit
 
 
 
 Hey father-in-law, those who contest elections, they themselves do not hang on to ideology
 jahaan phayda dikhataa he, udhare dhulak jate hai
 
 
 
 magar jainath bhaiya hai ki imosanal hue rahete hai
 
 
 
 ’ navhe ne phir jayanath ko hulakaara
 But Jaynath remained silent
 aisi baton par vah praayah pratikraya nahin detaa
 There was silence for a while
 ‘aapako kya lagata he master sahib, agali baar bhi rashtriya janhit party hi aegi centre main?’ ek master ji ne duusare master ji se poocha
 'today, this analysis is published in the newspaper
 vahi aegi
 
 
 
 abhi kai saal or yahi rahane vaali he, bhai
 
 
 
 ’‘lekin kaamkaaj to kuch kiya he nahin
 Only its leaders speak a lot? "" Who does not speak? 
 
 sab bolte hai
 But right now, people are listening to them, they are listening
 log sun rahe hai, isliye ye bol rahe hai
 
 
 
 dikh bhi to nahin rahaa koi doosraa vikalp
 
 
 
 ’ master ji ne gyaan diya
 'hey Masab, the right thing is that we don't see the right option
 
 
 
 Intentionally, we do not want to see the right option
 
 
 
 But it's okay
 
 
 
 Many things are not needed in our lives, yet we keep facing them - like mosquitoes
 jab barsaat hoti he to ve kuch zyada bhinbhinanaa shuru kar dete hai
 But they are destroyed as the weather changes
 vaise hi ye bhi hai
 
 
 
 ’ yah jayanath kii tippanee thi
 Everyone's eyes turned to Jayanath and then a slight laughter emerged and intensified
 charshobhit thakur abhi jila mukhyalay pahunche hi the ki unke smart phone par ek khabari navhe kaa naam sahit cheharaa chamak uthaa
 Shobhit Thakur, putting a motorcycle in his office, picked up the phone with his ear - "say, Narayan ji?" man khush ho gaya
 
 
 
 chatti par sab log aapaki tarif kar rahe the
 
 
 
 magar uu jainathva bahut tinn-phinn karata he
 
 
 
 ’‘kaa kah rahaa tha?’‘aap to janbe karte hai, uu ulta hi bolta he
 Was saying that you search trucks on the road at night
 
 
 
 The leaders of the Rashtriya Janhit Party are like mosquitoes, if the rain comes, it will end
 
 
 
 Brother, you have to do something
 
 
 
 "hey Narayan ji, you know that Oo is crazy
" 
 
 
 What to get involved with that
 
 
 
 Now you are going to enter politics
 agle saal paradhani kaa chunaav ladane vaale hai
 If you come in such a way, then the public will leave you
 
 
 
 Stay in love, brother
 
 
 
 Some people should just listen, not take it to heart
 
 
 
 Let him speak
 aap apane kaam par dhyaan dijie
 
 
 
 kal shaam ko block aphis main morcha kii baithak rakhi he, yaad he na aapako?
 
 
 You will definitely reach with your men
 
 
 
 And yes, you keep an eye on Jayanath's whatsapp and Facebook to write what propagates against us
 
 
 
 Rest, do nothing
 milte-julate rahiye, dua-salaam banaae rakhie
 
 
 
 raajnneeti main virdohi par najar rakhana zyada jaruri hota he
 
 
 
 ’‘ji bhaiya, main samaj gaya
 See you tomorrow at the block office 
 
 
 Now i keep the phone
 pranaam bhaiya
 The meeting of Rashtriya Janhit Yuva Morcha workers in the '000 district office was very strong
 shobhit thakur ne khub joshila bhaashan diya
 Many explosive action plans were made
 uske baad patrakaron ke saath chaay-samose par baatcheet hui
 The list of action plans passed in the meeting was submitted to him
 phir shobhit thakur ne khaas khabar kaa khulaasa kiya- ‘aaj dahacor chatti par videshi itihaaskaar dampatti aae the
 They are studying the history of the places here in a new way
 unhone yahaan ke bahut saare aitihaasik sakshya juta rakhe hai
 Seeing the architecture of Dahkaur Pokhara, the temple and well there, he told that all three things were built by the Mauryan rulers
 
 
 
 This is a new historical revelation
 
 
 
 We should be ashamed that we are unable to handle our heritage
 videshi log aakar hamen bataate hai ki kya-kya chijen hamaari dharohar hai
 
 
 
 hamaari saanskrithik udaseenta kaa hi nateeja he ki vah aitihaasik pokhara ab kooda-karkat se bharta chalaa gaya he, ghuraa ban gaya he
 
 
 
 abhi aap logon ko siddheshwar ji vahaan kii tasviren uplabdh karaayenge
 
 
 
 aaj hamane prastaav paas kiya he ki dahacor pokhara kaa jirnoddhar karaayenge
 For this, we have written a letter to Hon'ble Chief Minister, MLA, MP and District Magistrate
 
 
 
 We hope that in the same way we will be able to save other historical heritage
 yah silsilaa chalata rahegaa
 
 
 
 dhanyavad
 'on the next day, there was big news in the local editions of all the newspapers with the picture on the top page -' Mauryan pond found in Dahkor '
 chitra ke neeche capshan tha- ‘rashtriya janhit party ke yuva morcha ke adhyaksh shobhit thakur ke saath videshi itihaaskaar’
 There was also a small picture of garbage spread in the pokhara - with the caption 'badhaal historical pond'
 isi khabar ke saath vistaar se shobhit thakur kaa bayaan darj tha
 Chakkalas was on the rock
 har koi khabar padhanaa chahta tha, tasviir dekhnaa chahta tha
 At every Chatti shop, people were seen taking pictures alternately, leaning ten to ten mundi on a page of newspaper
 chaay kii bhaap ke saath tarah-tarah kii pratikriyaayein uth rahi thim
 Smartphone-related Navahs started broadcasting on whatsapp by taking a picture of the newspaper or stitching the link
 is tarah jo navhe din bhar watsap par chutkule talashte, padhate, haahaa hihi huhu karte phirte the, unhen yah garv karne kaa vishay haath lag gaya tha
 Comments were being commented on regarding this news
 yojanaayen-dar-yojanaayen banane main jute gaye the
 In this way, new ideas of employment were taking shape in the new generations
 
 
 
 Now, the future of Dahkaur Chatti was beginning to be seen as a shining city in America
 vikaas ke nae sapane kalle phodne lage the
 On the other hand, the headmaster of Khaini Malate Middle School at Jaynath's shop issued a statement - 'come on, it's good
 ab ghuraa ban gaye is pokhare ke din phirenge, is chatti kii thodi raunak badhegi
 
 
 
 itihaas main darj ho gai yah chatti bhi
 
 
 
 shobhit thakur kii badaulat hi yah kaam hona tha
 As it happens, it is getting better
 
 
 
 ''that's right
 
 
 
 Brother, everyone talks about building roads and buildings
 pokhar-talab, mandir jaisi aitihaasik jagahon kii chintaa kam hi log karte hai
 
 
 
 shobhit thakur ne sochaa, yah badi baat he
 
 
 
 ’ ek master ji ne hunkaari bhari
 'good, if there is a leader like Shobhit Thakur, there will be a lot of improvement in this area
 
 
 
 At first there was no leader here
 saalon-saal tak baahar ke netaa yahaan aakar vidhayaki or saansadi kaa chunaav ladate the or jeet kar mantri-santri ban jate or phir is ilaake ko bhul jaaya karte the
 
 
 
 ab shobhit thakur jaise ladke raajnneeti main aa rahe hai, apane ilaake ke liye kuch kar to rahe hai
 
 
 
 ’ padosi gaanv ke gram pradhan ne baat aage badhaai
 As a result, Narasimha Yadav, a teacher of Geography, who retired from Adhapur Inter College, stopped the blast in front of Jayanath's shop and descended and joined the Fursatia group
 middle skool ke headmaster ne unhen dekhte hi sawaal daaga- ‘aaj kaa akhbaar dekha aapane matssaab?’‘kya?’‘is pokhare ko aitihaasik dharohar ke rup main sahejane or iske jirnoddhar kii maang jo uthi he?
 
 
 What are your thoughts on this? "" Yes, i read the news in the morning
 ghar par akhbaar mangaata hum
 
 
 
 acchhee baat he
 If Pokhara is considered as a historical heritage, it will be a matter of pride for all of us
 
 
 
 But i doubt that will happen
 uski lambii prakriya he
 
 
 
 iskaa jirnoddhar ho jaae, to bhi badi baat he
 
 
 
 ’ bhugol ke matssaab ne badi thandi-si pratikraya di
 'but what is the problem in considering it as a historical heritage?' a ninth person expressed curiosity
 ‘bhai, hamaare-aapke kehane se koi cheez aitihaasik dharohar thode ho jaaegi
 First the people of the Archaeological Department will check whether it is actually historical or not, then it will be declared historical
 
 
 
 If it was truly declared a historical site, then the parts of this chatti woke up
 yahaan paryatak aane lagenge
 
 
 
 mandir kaa mahatva bad jayega, so dur-dur se log aane lagenge
 
 
 
 so, samajhie ki is chatti ke bhaag jaag gaye
 
 
 
 ’master ji kii is baat ne jaise ubalati chaay main thanda pani daal diya
 Now the bizarre variety of khichdi started cooking
 kuch logon ne to master sahab kii is baat ko pakad kar ummiden paalni or man hi man mannaten manani shuru kar di thi ki pokhare or mandir ko kisi bhi tarah aitihaasik dharohar maan liya jaae, taaki is ilaake kaa bhaag jage
 Open some employment opportunities for us
 magar duusari taraf kuch logon ke man main is samachar ko pard kar kuch der pehle jo gubbaaraa phula hua tha, usamen baarik-sa sooraakh ho gaya tha
 Also there were third type of people, who were not very educated
 kheti-baari or lokachar main jinka jivan vyateet hota tha, ve apane dhang se talab kii aitihaasikta kaa pareekshan kar rahe the
 There were different expectations from the news of his renovation
 koi apane dada-pardada kii sunai baton kaa hawala dekar kahata ki talab bana to pehle tha, par uske ghaaton ko nae sire se banwaaya tha rajbali raay ke pardada ne
 Some would say, new leaders have been born, they do not know about their fathers and fathers properly, they have gone on to tell the history of Chandragupta Maurya
 
 
 
 In lieu, they keep raising the Eve
 
 
 
 But, after being churned in hopes, a ninth, after much churning, gave a saintly statement like a supreme knowledgeer - 'people are expressing apprehensions in vain
 
 
 
 Hey, is the archeology department out of government? 
 
 vah bhi sarkare ke under main na kaam karata he, usamen bhi ham aap jaise log hi na kaam karte hai
 
 
 
 sarkaar kahegi to puraatatva vibhaag pokhara ko mauryaal kaa maanane se inkaar kar degaa?
 
 
 It will be named after Rajbali Rai
 
 
 
 Hey, when foreign historians are saying, the Archaeological Department will listen to them, that of the semi-people here
 
 
 
 See, the government will get it declared as a historical site
 
 
 
 'then on the withering dreams as the rain sprayed
 samachar chhapane ke baad kareeb maheene bhar tak isi tarah kii baaten- baton ko katati baaten, ek-duusare main mil kar nai baaten banaati baaten, ummiden jagaatin baaten, niraash karti baaten, chatti kii tamaam dukaanon se lekar gaanvon tak main chalati raheen
 Then one day a small news report appeared on the front page in the local editions of the same newspapers - 'archaeological department will consider the approval of the restoration of Dahkaur Pokhare, the status of the historical site
 ’phir ummiido ne pachakhiyaan phenkani shuru kar di
 The phones of the young ones started ringing again
 chatti par jamaavada aaj kuch zyada tha
 The ninth were coming from village to village with motorcycles
 kishor panwari kii dukaan par paan ke pattey kam pad gaye the, so usne apane bete ko pattey laane ko motorcycle se shahar dauda diya tha
 a Naviha called a Naviha walking next to Shobhit Thakur - "hey brother, what is the program of the Speaker?"
 
 
 chatti par kitni der main pahunchenge?
 
 
 Come, let us make a short speech of the Speaker here
 
 
 
 Hey brother, we have done such a big job, we all can at least wear garlands of them
 dhanyavad karnaa he unka
 
 
 
 aaie ham taiyaari karte hai
 
 
 
 ’ phir usne phone band kar teen-chaar navhon ko sambodhit kiya- ‘are bhai, pahunch rahe hai adhyaksh ji pandrah-bees minute main
 Quickly pick up posts from shops and set up here
 
 
 
 He said pointing to the empty space in front of Jayanath's shop
 phir ek navhe ko dukaan ko phool-maala dene vaale mali ke ghar daudaya- ‘fatafat do-chaar maale or kuch phool le aao
 Pulling some money out of his pocket and said- 'if you fall short, take it from your side, else say to the gardener, i have sent it, i will calculate later
 
 
 
 'the ninth were activated
 sabase pehle jayanath kii dukaan kii chaukiyon par baithe logon ko uthaaya or chowkiyaan uthaa leen
 Then bringing checkpoints from other shops, placing them one on top of each, prepared a small platform
 kareeb aadhe ghante baad das-baarah motorcykilon par savaar navhon kaa kafila liye shobhit thakur pahunche
 As soon as he arrived, Navhe, riding on the next motorcycle, raised his arm and shouted - 'shobhit Thakur Zindabad
 
 
 ’ to puri chatti jindabad ke naare se gunj uthi
 'how should our leader
 
 
 ’ ‘shobhit thakur jaisaa ho
 
 
 "har har har
" 
 
 ’ ‘mahadev
 
 
 The slogans kept echoing for five-seven minutes
 shobhit thakur haath jode muskaraate rahe or chowkiyaan jod kar bane manch par chadh gaye
 The young man who had organized this ceremonial public rally, climbed up and garlanded Shobhit Thakur, flowers were poured from the bottom of the stage
 phir jansabha ke aayojak navhe ne utsaah se bhar kar sankshipt bhaashan diya- ‘yah hamaare liye garv kaa vishay he ki hamaare priy netaa mananeey shobhit thakur ji ke athak prayaason se is chatti ke din phirane vaale hai
 The renovation of the puddle of Pokhara has been approved and a new picture of development is about to emerge in this area
 main aap sabaki taraf se mananeey shobhit thakur kaa aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 
 
 Thank you 
 
 abhinandan karata hum
 
 
 
 ’ phir ek baar usne naaraa lagaaya- ‘shobhit thakur jindabad
 
 
 'and once again the chanti slogans echoed
 uske baad shobhit thakur ne garv se bhaashan diya- ‘aap sabake aashirwad or sneh kaa prabhaav he ki main yah kaam kar paaya
 My effort is to develop this chatti and this entire area
 yah meraa pehla prayaas safal hua he, jiske chalate ek aitihaasik dharohar ko nayaa jivan milane vaala he
 
 
 
 abhi pokhare ke jirnoddhar kii manjuuri mili he, par main aap sabko vishwaas dilaataa hum ki bahut jaldi ise puraatatva vibhaag kii taraf se aitihaasik dharohar kaa darja bhi mil jayega
 
 
 
 tab yah jagah vishwa maanchitr par apni pahchaan bana legi
 
 
 
 or chota munh badi baat na lage, to main aapako vishwaas dilaataa hum ki ise ek din main sanyukt raashtra kii vishwa viraasat kii suchi main bhi shaamil kara kar rahoonga
 
 
 
 duniya bhar se yatri yahaan aaenge
 New employment opportunities will open
 
 
 
 The fate of this area will open
 
 
 
 i am sure that in the same way all your cooperation and blessings will continue, so there are plans for a lot of work in this area, in my mind, they will all come true
 
 
 
 Just this morning i had a call on the phone with my honorable MP and honorable MLA
 ve apni vikaas nidhi se kuch paisa is kaam ke liye dene ko taiyaar ho gaye hai
 
 
 
 aaj ham jiladhikari mahoday se milane ja rahe hai
 The administration will study this place, make a map and then work will start soon
 
 
 
 Thank you
 ’taaliyaan baji
 Expectations raised some more
 chahus din ke baad se logon kaa pokhare kii taraf aana-janaa bad gaya tha
 Everyone looked at Pokhara in their own way and everyone had their own ideas about its renovation, everyone had some outline in their mind
 din bhar chatti ke vikaas or pokhar kii khudaai-safai vagairah ke theke aadi ko lekar charchaaen hone lageen
 a fursatia novae sitting at Jaynath's shop gave a statement- 'jainath Bhaiya may be opposed to Shobhit Thakur, but he will get the most benefit from his efforts
 inaki dukaan pokhare ke bilkul paas he, so inhen kii dukaan kii raunak sabase zyada badhane vaali he
 
 
 
 ab ye bhi yahaan chanaa-pakodee-chaay bechney ke bajaay chhole-bhature, choumin, rasmalai vagairah bechney lagenge
 
 
 
 isliye bhaiya jitne din inaki chaay mil rahi he pi lo, nahin to jaldi hi ye chaay bananaa band kar denge
 
 
 
 ’navhe kii baat par kahkahe lage
 Then dreams started being sown
 magar jayanath ne koi pratikriya nahin di
 Hence, no one could understand whether he was happy with the news of Pokhara's renovation and Chatti's development
 khiz kar sabane ek baar phir use baklol ghoshit kiya or baat kaa rukh kisi or taraf mode diya
 On one such day, the Tehsildar saheb came with three to four people on a full day
 saath main bandookdhaari do sipaahi bhi laae
 He got off the jeep and went first to Pokhara
 pokhare, mandir or kuen kaa jayja liya or jayanath kii dukaan par aakar baith gaye
 When he asked his subordinate staff, he spread the map on the post
 jayanath bina kahe unke liye chaay banane main jute gaya tha
 After seeing the map, the Tehsildar Sahib got up and stood on the side of the road and looked carefully towards the shops standing on the road towards Pokhara
 maatahat karmchaaree or sipaahi bhi unki bagal main khadey ho gaye
 Sitting on all the shops in Chatti, Gapiyate Fursatia also gathered slowly
 isi bich jayanath chaay lekar aayaa or tehseeldaar sahab samet sabhi karmchaariyon ke haath main ek-ek gilaas pakadaa gaya
 They kept putting some marks on the map for a while
 aasapaas jute ai bheed ke kuch utsaahi or jigyaasu master or navhon ne bhi nakshe par nigaah dhansa kar dekhne-samajhane kii koshish kii ki ve kya yojana bana rahe hai, par sipaahiyon ne unhen jhidak kar dur hataa diya tha
 Everyone drank tea and wrapped it in a jeep and sunk it
 jeep chaalu hui or chali gai
 No one came to know what Tehsildar Saheb planned on the map, what he planned
 magar sab apni-apni atkalapachi se tarah-tarah kii baaten uchhaalate rahe
 Well, after the arrival of the Tehsildar, people were convinced that the work will start soon
 teen-chaar din baad thane se daaroga ji aae
 There were four-five soldiers together
 ve jeep se utre or jayanath kii dukaan ke saamne khadey hokar jeep ke bonut par nakshaa failaa diya
 This time Jayanath's heart was beating loudly, but without saying he offered tea to the furnace for him
 nakshe se najar hataa kar daaroga ji sidhe hue or sipaahiyon se kaha ki sabhi dukandaaron ko bula laaen
 There was no need to call, most of the shopkeepers had gathered around, so the confidant came to Daroga ji
 jayanath bhi chaay liye aa gaya or sabake haath main gilaasein pakadaane ke baad haath baandhe khadaa ho gaya
 Daroga Ji announced- 'look brother, you people know that the government has approved development work at this place
 pokhare ke jirnoddhar kii yojana bani he
 According to this plan, all the space from Pokhara to this road will have to be vacated
 idhar kii sari dukaane chunki gaanv samaaj kii jameen par khadi hai, yah jagah sarkari ghoshit kar di gai he
 There will be no shop here now
 aap sab log hafte bhar ke bheetar yahaan se apni-apni dukaane hataa lijie
 
 
 
 mujhe dubaara na aana pade
 
 
 
 mujhe vishwaas he ki aap log mujhe kisi tarah kii sakhti kaa mauka nahin denge
 
 
 
 ’ phir unhone chaay kii aakhri ghunt bhari, gilaas jayanath ke haath main pakadaaya or jeep kii agali seat par ja viraaje
 The soldiers also got into the jeep and the jeep returned
 ab nai tarah kii khusur-phusur shuru hui
 Everyone started looking at the shops built along the road towards Pokhara
 zyaadaatar dukaane gumti main thim, kuch chappar-chhaani kii thim, so unhen hataanaa mushkil nahin tha
 But there was a shop in them, which was made of brick and mortar
 use todane ke alaava koi chaara nahin tha
 That shop was Jayanath's
 
 
 
 It was not just a shop, it was also the residence of Jayanath
 usamen uskaa puraa parivaar rahata tha
 She was also very close to the pool
 isliye use kisi bhi tarah tuutane se bachaaya nahin ja saktaa tha
 When Daroga ji went, desolation at Jayanath's shop was lost
 isi bich kisi kherkhwaah navhe ne raay di- ‘agar jainath bhaiya ek baar shobhit thakur se mil kar baat karen, to yah dukaan tuutane se batch sakati he
 
 
 
 ’‘ab kuch nahin ho saktaa
 The whole map is ready
 
 
 
 Will Shobhit Thakur change the map? 
 
 ’ ek master ji ne pratikriya di
 'why not, they are leaders, brothers, they can do anything they want
 ’ navha apni raay par kaayam tha
 But Jayanath remained silent
 uske chehre par gussa, hataasha, paraajay, asahaayta kaa milajula bhav saaf najar aa rahaa tha
 He spent the whole day in despair
 000shaam ko jab andhera gahraane laga tha, madhopur ke yuva gram pradhan ne jayanath kii dukaan ke aage motorcycle roki or jayanath ke paas gaye
 At that time only one or two customers were sitting at the shop
 jayanath kii patni bhatthi par parivaar ke liye bhojan pakaa rahi thi
 The village headman took his mouth near Jayanath's ear and whispered, 'I am coming from the district headquarters
 ek bade bharosemand adhikari ne bataaya he ki is taraf sadak kinare kii sari jameen shobhit thakur ko ek rupye main sau saal ke patte par di ja rahi he
 They will build shops here and offer them on rent
 ’gram pradhan ke munh se madiraa kii tikhi gandh aa rahi thi, par jayanath ne use bardaasht kiya
 Had there been another day, he would have reprimanded the village head, but today he did not do so
 usne gram pradhan kii puri baat suni, par koi pratikriya nahin di

 Aryan is a businessman and Rajveer is a professional photographer
 aakhir tasha kin kaarnon se in donon bhaaiyon ke bich aati he, kahani main kitne twist terns aate hai or is baar in sabhi ghatnaon ke peeche kii asal vajah kya hoti he, saath hi rishma (ihana dhillan) or vikram khurana (gulshan grover) kii kya bhoomika hoti he, ye sab pataa karne ke liye aapako theatre jaakar film dekhni padegi
 Why you can see the story of the film film is good, but the way of telling it is right
 diarection,cinemetography lokation badhiya hai
 It is quite interesting to think about what is going to happen next moment
 abhinay ke maamle main karan wahi or vivaan bhatena ne thik kaam kiya he
 Watching them makes you miss a TV serial where there is loud background music with lots of twists, turns and suspense
 milaap jhaveri ke samvaad jabardast hai
 However, their delivery through actors could have been better
 urvashi rotela kaa kaam thik he jo or bhi behatar ho saktaa tha
 They need to work on their expressions
 ihana dhillan, gulshan grover or baaki sah kalakaaron kaa abhinay badhiya he
 In a moment you also see the presence of suspense in abbas-mustan's suspense thriller
 jin darshakon ko het story siries kii filmein pasand hai, unhen twist terns ke saath niraashaa nahin hogi
 The Hate story 4 trailer received over 1 crore views in a single day

 Although it is an adult film where the appearance of the body is definitely visible, but the precise screenplay could have made it even more interesting

 In UP, arrogant leaders within the Congress party expressed disapproval over the party's decision - Efforts are being made to destroy the party
 In Uttar Pradesh, there is fierce fighting within the Congress party
 congress party se nikaale gaye netaaon kaa aarope he ki party ko khatm karne ke liye bujurgon ko nazarandaaj kiya ja rahaa he
 The disciplinary committee of Uttar Pradesh Congress Party has shown the exit of 10 leaders of the state for anti-party activities

 Addressing a press conference in Lucknow, leader Santosh Singh, who was expelled from the party, said that we are extremely upset that action was taken against us
 yah saaf ho gaya he ki party ke varisht netaaon kaa apmaan kiya ja rahaa he saath hi hamen darkinar kiya ja rahaa he
 It is being spread that we are against Priyanka Gandhi's new team, which has more youth
 ham bhi youth politics se hi nikle hai, aise main ham kaise yuvaaon kii maujuudagi kaa party main virodh kar sakate hai
 All the allegations against us are baseless
 purv mantri ramakrishna dvivedi ne kaha ki party ke samvidhan ke mutabik hamen 6 saal ke liye party se baahar kiya janaa gaurkanoonee he saath hi nindaneey he
 We are AICC members, only the Central Committee can take every decision related to the removal

 We met separately to discuss the subject that we are being sideline from the party office
 ham vidrohi nahin hai
 Yes, but it is clear that some people intend that some people want to end the organization for their benefit
 hamen upisisi kii ore se koi notice nahin mila he ki 24 ghante ke bheetar jawaab diya jaae
 However, this claim is being made by UPCC
 congress ke hi varisht netaa or purv vidhayak bhudhar narayan mishra ne kaha ki upisisi kii nai team main kuch aise log bhi hai jinhen party kaa itihaas tak nahin pataa he
 On 20 November, all former mps and candidates who contested the Lok Sabha elections between 2014 and 2019 came for the meeting
 kul 600 aamantrit logon main se keval 50 log meeting ke liye aae
 This clearly means that no senior leader wants to come to the party meeting because of the ignoring of the seniors in the party
 sheersh netritv kii ore se logon kii upeksha ho rahi he
 Leaders excluded from the party have demanded that Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi take immediate cognizance of the matter
 purv saansad santosh singh, purv mantri ramakrishna dvivedi, satyadev treepathi, purv emelsi siraaj menhadi, purv vidhayak bhudhar narayaan mishra, vinod choudhary, nek chandra pandeya, youth congress ke purv rajya adhyaksh prakaash goswami or gorakhpur jile ke purv adhyaksh sanjeev singh ko party se anushaasan todane ke aarope main 6 saal ke liye baahar kar diya gaya he

 inamen se kareeb dedh darjan party netaaon ne pichley dinon purv saansad santosh singh ke awaas par baithak kar apni upeksha par naaraazgi jataai thi
 After this, on November 21, on the instructions of Priyanka Vadra, the disciplinary committee had given notice to the eleven members involved in the meeting and asked them to clarify within twenty four hours

 Kapil Sharma's apology in front of everyone on social media seems to have made no difference to Sunil Grover

 After this feud, no member of the old team other than Sunil Grover reached the shooting of 'the Kapil Sharma Show' on Monday

 So we cannot officially say that these two have left the show

 Sunil played the role of Gutthi in the previous show Comedy Nights with Kapil, aired on Kapil's Colors, something happened in the meantime that Sunil left the show and brought his new show Mad in India on Star, though he did not run the show And Sunil made a comeback on Kapil's show
 baad main jab colors channel se anban ke baad kamedi nits vid kapil band hua to sunil kapil ke saath bane rahe
 a few months ago, there were reports that Kapil refused to promote Sunil's film 'koffee with D' in his show, on which Sunil defended Kapil saying that everything is fine between the two

 is prakaar 2019 main ab tak kul paanch nae jile banaae ja chuke hai, jo kisi bhi mukhyamantri ke liye ek record he
 Meanwhile, demands for some others have also arisen: traders in Mayladuthurai were shutting down shops for three days in July, demanding a separate district to be carved out of Nagapattinam
 polachi (coimbatore main) or shankarankovil (thirunelaveli kii nagarpalika) ko bhi jila bana die jane kii maangen lagaataar uth rahi hai
 Before renaming the state to Tamil Nadu in 1969, it had only 13 districts
 uske baad kii vibhinn sarkaron ne prashasnic suvidha kaa tark dete hue nae-nae jile banaae jinaki sankhya ab 37 ho chuki he
 Today, Tamil Nadu ranks fourth in the country in terms of number of districts
 jile ke teen hisson main baantne ke samay ko lekar kuch logon kii bhauhen chadh gai hai
 Ramu Manivannan, chairman of the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at the University of Madras, says it is a strategic decision to eliminate the influence of minority Muslim votes
 ve kehete hai, ''yah vellore main dramuk ke paaramparik muslim vot bank ke liye ek sandesh bhi he
 "it is being touted as district restructuring, new in assembly constituencies and strengthening of the organization around smaller administrative centers
" behatar prashasan kii baaten to mahaj ek aavaran hai
 Clearly, the AIADMK is trying its best to somehow consolidate the party's position in the 2021 assembly elections, so that the elections can be challenged severely
 *** Machines have started working as humans
 agle varshon main yah trend or badhane vaala he
 So the question arises what should humans do now? What strategy should companies adopt in view of this future trend? The same topic was discussed on Thursday in Business Today's annual Leadership Summit 'mind Rush 2019'
 isamen dictionari for da future satr ko sambodhit karte hue futurist mike walsh ne kaha ki companiyon ko aise nae leaders kii jarurat hogi, jinamein nae tarah kaa skill ho
 Mike Walsh, CEO of Tumaro, has written several books like 'future Entertainment', 'the Dictionary of Dangerous Ideas'
 unhone nai tarah kii duniya, algaridm kii duniya main kis tarah se apana astitv bachaae rakhen, iske bare main apane vichaar rakhe
 His three major views are as follows - 1
 kisi kaarobaar main oparating system ko apgrade karnaa uski samskruti kaa hissaa hona chahie
 Companies need people of fresh and different thinking - people who can make good decisions even in complex situations, who can accept the world in a changing form
 kisi sanghathan ke sarvshereshth log bhavishya main aise kaam karenge jinka aaj astitv hi nahin he
 At the same time, ethics should be part of the companies' culture
 companiyaan data culture yaa data chori jaisi ghatnaon ko bardaasht nahin kar saktin
 2
 aisa netritv viksit karnaa chahie jo jinamein maanav jatilta kii gahari samaj ho or computesnal takanic kii bhi samaj ho
 Walsh has named such leaders 'algaridmic leaders'
 aise leaders main kisi samasya ko chote-chote tukade main baant kar ek samaadhaan nikaalane kii kshamta honi chahie
 3
 kaarobaar main vailu laane kaa matlab sirf automation nahin he
 The actual value is data
 companiyon ko aisi samskruti taiyaar karnaa chahie jisamen data aadhaarit nirnay liye ja saken
 Walsh feels that if companies have the data and the appropriate culture, it will be easier to redesign a business in the future
 iske liye ek acchhee shuruyaat yah ho sakati he ki har hafte data par ek manthan satr yojit kiya jaae or logon se yah kaha jaae ki ve is bare main idia den ki data ke liye best posible yuj kya ho saktaa he
 The Business Today mindrash program is a business-based event of the India Today Group
