 kendriya vishvavidhyalay shikshak sanghon kii federation (FEDCUTA) ne aarope lagaaya he ki modi sarkaar savarna voton ke dar se kota roster faisle ko thande baste main rakhe hue he
 The decision on appointments to higher education institutions (heis) has been hanging since July after the Allahabad High Court order
 FEDCUTA ke adhyaksh professor rajib re ne india today ko bataaya ki maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne pehle ke rigerveshan roster ko behaal karne ke liye adhyadesh laane kaa bharosa diya tha, kyonki sansad kaa satr chal rahaa he isliye ab sarkaar ko bill laana chahie
 Explain that in March this year, the High Court had canceled the 200-point roster, in which the college / university was considered a unit
 iske baad vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog (UGC) ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki ek vibhaag ko apane aap main hi base unit mana jayega jisase ki anusuchit jati (SC) or anusuchit janajati (ST) ke liye surakshit shikshakon ke padon kii gananaa kii ja sake
 This is a disadvantage situation for teachers coming from SC-ST category
 gatirodh itnaa badha ki kalege / vishvavidhyalayon ko kakshaen tadarth (ad hoc) shikshakon kii madad le kar chalaani padin
 Professor Ray said, "immediately after the High Court's decision on March 5 last year, FEDCUTA, DUTA along with some other university teachers unions protested and sent their representation to the Minister of Human Resource Development
 hamase vaada kiya gaya ki sarkaar supreme court main apil daakhil karegi
 We have been repeatedly asking the government to bring ordinances to restore the old roster
 lekin usne abhi tak kuch nahin kiya he sivaae ek apil daakhil karne ke, is vajah se sabhi niyuktiyaan ruuk si gai hai
 Professor Ray claimed that all political parties including Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, CPM and CPI have supported the Teachers Association on this issue
 aise main sarkaar ko 200 point vaale roster ko behaal karne ke liye bill laane main koi dikkat nahin honi chahie
 He should have done this in April itself
 professor re ne kaha, ‘ye dekhnaa hairaan karne vaala tha ki hoicourt ke aadesh ke tatkaal baad 7 se 10 vishvavidhyalayon ne nae aarakshan virdohi roster ke mutabik niyuktiyon ke liye vigyaapan jari kiye
 This was a clear indication that the anti-reservation stance in education is an important stance
 sarkaar ke nirnay naa lene se akele dilli vishvavidhyalay main hi riktiyaan 50% tak pahunch gai hai
 Due to this, both reserved and general category candidates are waiting for the appointments
 in rictiyon ko bharne ke liye koi jaldi nazar nahin aati

 There is nothing new in it that when you work for more time in one place, it is possible that your boss is younger than you
 aise main umr kaa yah faasla kaamkaaj ke morche par dikkatein paidaa kar saktaa he
 Learn how to work with a young boss happily: No hurry: If the boss is a young man, then he will be a bad boss, do not make such a assumption at all
 sakaaratmak sochie
 a boss younger than himself is an emotional matter, so it has to be dealt with emotionally
 agar aisa nahin kar paaenge, to kaamkaaj par asar hoga
 Put your intelligence: In the office, trust is heard
 umr zyada he, to kaam kii raftaar kam hogi, umr kam he, to smartphone se chipka rahata hoga, ye sabhi dharanaen hai, jinase dur rahiye
 It used to happen in our days, even using these things will not help
 nai cheez, nae shaks ko nae nazariye se dekhie-parakhie
 Respect is important: even if the boss will be less than you in age, but if he was not capable, then he would not have reached this position
 matbhed ho sakate hai, lekin isse uski dakshata par sawaal nahin uthta
 If the boss provides strong leadership and positive partnership despite being young, then age does not matter
 badlaav ke liye taiyaar:dimag khulaa rakhie or kaamkaaj karne ko lekar ravaiya hameshaa lacheela rakhie
 Younger bosses generally prefer to have more conversations over phone, mail, rather than meetings
 agar aap bos ko saajhedaar or sahyogi kii tarah samajhenge, to uski dikkatein bhi samaj paaenge or samaadhaan bhi khojane main madad dengebos ko sikhie:apane se kam umr ke bos ko sikhaane ko madad dene kaa sabase acha tarika use wo bataanaa he, jo wo nahin jaanata
 If you are already working in the office, then you can reach the boss many important information
 sirf jaankaree dijie, uske saath salaah yaa lacture jaisaa kuch mat dijie baat karen, baat banegibaat karen, baat banengi:aapaki or bos kii umr main kitna bhi antar kyon naa ho, sabase zyada jaruri baat he ki aap donon ke bich talmail hona chahie
 And it is very important for him to have a conversation
 aapse kya ummid kii ja rahi he, ye jaananaa behad jaruri he
 Be Sensitive: It is difficult to keep quiet with the information and experience you have gained over the years, but try
 aise vyavhaar se bachie, jo yuva peedi ko naaraaz karen
 Never compare your manager to your children
 aisa bhi mat jataaie ki aap sab kuch jaanate hai
 Stay as you are: We try to be the way our boss is
 lekin yah galat he, aisa naa karen
 The distance in age cannot be changed by changing clothes or living
 aisa karne se aap par zyada sawaal uthenge, jo behatar nahin
 To know your boss, you can take coffee or another break

 2
 In that case the army will reach the verge of breakdown, if it is unable to take care of its people, then its people can turn to BJP
 3
 Modi's powerful development campaign and the cocktail of Hindutva may erode the military's identity
 4
 Putting an outside weapon would mean that the army is weak and does not speak like Uddhav's Bal Thackeray
 5
 Shivaji is very prominent in the bjp's new slogan and Shivaji has been associated with Modi's slogan

 bijepi ke kai netaa sena se dosti todane ke pach main hai or ahm ko badhaava de rahe hai

 Today was the second day of the strike by Coal India employees
 shaam ko sarkaar se baatcheet ke baad karmchaaree netaaon ne hadtaal samaapti kii ghoshnaa kii
 Energy Minister Piyush Goyal spoke to the staff leaders and said that the government will set up a committee which will look into the problems of the employees and give their recommendations to the government
 koyala mantri piyush goyal ne kaha ki sarkaar kii nijeekaran kii koi yojana nahin, kol india ke karmchaariyon ke hiton kii raksha kii jaaegi Negotiations between the government and employees were broken on Tuesday
 karmchaaree union ke mutabik, sarkaar sankat kaa hal nikaalane kii disha main kaam nahin kar rahi thi
 In fact, the coal ministers did not participate in the talks yesterday, but the coal secretary had joined the talks, although both sides have expressed hope that the talks will continue
 kol india duniya kii sabase badi koyala khanan company he or iske lakhon karmchaariyon ke hadtaal par jane se desh main bijli sankat bhi gaharaa saktaa he
 a large part of the country's electricity generation depends on coal
 intak netaa es kyuu jamaa ne kaha, hamaara virodh kol india ke public sector kairactor ko badalane ke liye adhyadesh laane kii sarkaar kii pahal ke khilaaf he
 On the very first day of the strike, its impact was seen on more than 100 coal mines of Jharkhand
 chhattisgarh main 66 koyala khadaan band raheen or maharashtra kii 36 koyala khadaanon main kaam thap rahaa
 The magnitude of this strike can be gauged from the fact that Coal India is the world's largest coal mining company
 kol india bharat main 81% koyala utpaadan karti he, or uskaa bharat ke koyala bazaar par 74% kabza he
 The company supplies coal to 82 of the 86 coal-fired thermal plants
 uske paas har din ausatan qareeb 15 lakh ton koyala utpaadan kii kshamta he yani 5 din kii hadtaal chali to 75 lakh ton koyala kaa utpaadan kam ho jayega
 The pressure on the government is increasing due to the crisis, but the coal minister seemed to avoid speaking anything openly throughout the day
 america sena ne pakistan kii dahalij par based afghanistani praant nangarhaar main apana sabase taqatvar bam giraaya he
 But US defense experts believe that President Trump may have targeted Afghanistan, but his focus is on North Korea
 kyon ISIS nahin tha asli nishaanaa?america ke kai jaankaar maan rahe hai ki agar america kaa makasad iesas kii qamar todna hota to ye bam syria yaa iraq main giraaya ja saktaa tha
 The reality is that 'mother of All Bombs' was not designed against terrorist targets
 yahi vajah he ki bush or obama prashasan ne kabhi aatanki thikaanon ke khilaaf iskaa istemaal karne kii nahin sochi
 At least on paper, America's military strategy is to win the hearts of the local population and defeat the terrorists, not to wipe them out
 lihaaja itnaa taqatvar bam aatankiyon ke khilaaf giraanaa is ranneeti kaa hissaa nahin ho saktaa
 Likewise, ISIS is not as big a threat as the Taliban in Afghanistan
 afghanistani janata, america sena or khud taliban bhi is sanghathan se dushmani kii kasame khate hai
 The message to North Korea is that the 'mother of All Bombs' was created during the Iraq War
 ise bhumigat parmaanu thikaanon ko tabah karne ke liye hi dizin kiya gaya he
 Apart from Iran, North Korea has also built many such destinations
 ye koi raaj nahin he ki trump ke satta sanbhaalane ke baad america prashasan ne uttar korea ke khilaaf rukh kadaa kiya he
 After meeting with the President of China recently, Donald Trump had said bluntly that if Beijing could not control Pyongyang, the US would deal with it in its own way
 washington kii phikr is baat ne badhaai he ki uttar korea ne kul paanch parmaanu pareekshanon main se teen pichley paanch saal ke dauraan kiye hai
 Two of these have been done last year
 uttar korea ke up-videshmantri ne saaf kiya he ki jarurat padane par unka desh dobaaraa bhi parmaanu bam kaa pareekshan karne se nahin chukegaa
 This makes US allied countries like South Korea and Japan feel insecure
 ye bhi koi sanyog nahin he ki america ne 13 april ko madar of ol bombs kaa istemaal kiya he
 While April 15 is the birthday of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un
 pakistan ko apane aatank ke network ko khatm karnaa hi hoga
 Defense Minister AK Antony on Wednesday gave a clear message to Pakistan that excuses will not work
 pakistan ko is baar aatank ke khilaaf thos karrwai kerani hogi
 Antony also said that India has kept all its options open
 pakistan ne vahi kiya jisaki ashanka thi
 He dismissed the evidence of the Mumbai attack without looking
 lekin aisi chalbaaji ke jariye pakistan apni khaal nahin bachaa saktaa
 India has once again bluntly told Pakistan that they did not live in a mogul
 bharat ne apane saare vikalp khule rakhe hai
 Defense Minister AK Antony said that Pakistan has to end its network of terror going on here
 aatankwaad kii training dene vaale teror camp ko dhwast karnaa hoga
 Significantly, for the first time on Tuesday, the Prime Minister also directly blamed the government agencies of Pakistan directly for the Mumbai attacks and now Antony has given a strong message to Pakistan by saying that all options are open
 bharat ke die sabooton ko nakaar kar pakistan ne ye sabit kar diya he ki uski manshaa aatankiyon par karrwai karne kii bilkul nahin he
 In such a situation, what other way does India have to consider other options
 duniya bhi pakistan kii is chalbaaji ko bakhubi samaj rahi he
 US Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher has once again confessed to the Pakistani conspiracy in the Mumbai attacks
 is bich america rajdoot or britain ke ucchayukta videsh sachiv se mulaakaat kii
 This meeting of American and British diplomats is considered very important after the evidence is denied by Pakistan
 pakistan kii aatanki niti ke khilaaf duniya bhar main taiyaar ho rahe janamat kii ek or baangi he america rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar stephen hedli kaa bayaan jisamen unhone saaf kaha he ki america sarkaar ke liye pakistan kii haalat chintaa kaa sabase badi vajah ban gai he

 Even a young man from Delhi rides on a similar bike on the road and then brakes himself at the speed of his life

 That was the speed of his life

 His passion for riding the super bike and talking through the air

 It is not known whether he had just written a few lines in his Facebook post or whether he really had this attitude about life

 Nearly thirty percent of those who die are people who ride on a two-wheeler

 But by adding clarification in the latest order not to deploy security guards of private security agencies or guards of civil defense etc
, the Commission has made it clear that in this situation only armed police force personnel will be deployed under any circumstances
 unhone bataaya ki isse pehle bhi iviem vivipat kii suraksha main sashastr police balon ko hi tainaat kiya jaataa rahaa he
 There is no scope for any kind of confusion about this, for which this clarification has been issued in the latest instructions

 During the appearance of media personality Rupert Madrek in front of British mps in the phone hacking scandal, a highly dramatic incident occurred when an unauthorized person was attacked during the trial
 madrek ne kaha ki aaj kaa din unke jivan kaa sabase vinamrata bharaa din he kyonki unhone or unke putr james ne phone hekking ghotaale ke peediton se kshamaa maangi he lekin is ghotaale ke liye vah jimmedaar nahin hai
 Eighty-year-old Madrek's shoulder attacked him with a plastic plate from behind
 is vyakti kii pahchaan johny marble ke rup main hui he
 He entered the committee's high-security room unauthorizedly
 is ghatnakram ke chalate sansadeey samiti ke samaksh chal rahi sunwaayi kareeb 15 minute tak ruk gai
 This hearing is being broadcast live worldwide
 is vyakti ne khud ko kaaryakarta or hasya kalakaar bataaya
 He came from behind to Madrek and hit him with a saucer with a bearded foam on it
 madrek kii patni wendi deng turant bachaav ke liye aage aayin or is ghuspaithiye ko thappad maarthe dikhin
 During the hearing in a tense atmosphere, Madrek and his son apologized for the phone hacking scandal
 is ghotaale ke kaaran madrek ke media gharaane ko nuksaan pahunchaa he or police tathaa netaa isaki chapet main aa gayi hai
 Madarek and his son told mps, 'these activities were not in line with our company's expected standards
 ’ austrailia main janmen or vaishvik media gharaane ‘da news kaperereshan’ ke pramukh madrek ne ghotaale kii jaanch kar rahi house of comons kii samskruti, media tathaa khel maamalon kii samiti se kaha, ‘yah mere jivan kaa sabase vinamrata bharaa din he
 'the committee is investigating to find out to what extent the News of the World committed the crime
 assi varshiya madrek ne kaha ki unhen yah jaanakar bahut ‘hairaani or sharmindagi’ hui he ki unke samachar patr ‘news of da world’ ne mili doular naam kii 12 varshiya ladki kaa phone bhi hack kiya tha
 He told the mps that he was not aware that the spread of hacking was more than previously claimed
 unhone kaha ki unhen unke kuch karmchaariyon ne unhen nishchit taur par digbhramit kiya
 Madrek refused to take full responsibility for the phone hacking scandal
 saansad gym sheriden ne unase sawaal kiya, ‘kya aap yah sweekaar karte hai ki aakhirkaar is puure prakaran ke liye aap hi jimmedaar hai
 'madrek bluntly replied,' No
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘is santhaan ke liye maine aise logon ko niyukt kiya tha jin par mujhe puraa bharosa tha ki ve ise thik tarah se sanchalit kar sakate hai
 This is the first time in Madrek's 40-year career in the media in Britain that he has faced direct questioning from mps
 samiti ke samaksh pesh huin ‘news international’ kii purv mukhya kaaryakari adhikari rebeka brookes ne kaha ki vah is baat se avgat thim ki ‘news of da world’ ne nijee jasuson kii sevaaon kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Rebecca, 43, said, "I was aware that 'news of the World' used private detectives
" ’ hekking ghotaale main mukhya taur par nishane par aayin rebeka ne kaha ki unhone pulicekarmiyon ko bhugtan kiye jane ko kabhi manjuuri nahin di thi
 While regretting tapping the conversation, he said, 'we worked as fast as possible for the evidence
 ’rebeka ne saansadon se kaha, ‘galtiyaan huin lekin ham unhen durust kar rahe hai
 'this issue has shaken the British system and due to this Prime Minister David Cameron is under immense pressure
 is ghotaale main desh ke do sheersh police adhikariyon ko apane pad se istipha dena padaa
 Cameron appointed Andy Coulson, the former editor of 'news of the World', to head his liaison department
 koulson ko do saptaah pehle giraftaar kiya tha
 He resigned as editor after allegations of phone hacking
 madrek ne kaha ki news of da world unke vaishvik vyapaar kaa maatr ek pratishat he
 At the start of the hearing, President of 'news International' James apologized to the victims of the hacking incident, saying that he regretted that his organization did not pose a threat to the expected standards
 unhone kaha ki vah chizon ko durust karne ke liye patibaddh hai or yah sunishchit karana chaahate hai ki is tarah kii ghatnaon kii punrariti nahin ho
 James said, 'I want to say that i and our organization feel sorry for the victims and their family members for illegally tapping the voicemail
 ’ madrek ke putr james ne kaha ki unhen na to is baat kii jaankaree he or na hi koi saboot he ki news international ke purv mukhya kaaryakari adhikari ribeka brooks ko phone hekking ke bare main koi jaankaree thi
 Meanwhile, returning to his Africa tour midway, Prime Minister Cameron said that the scam had created 'big problems' that could be resolved
 unhone lagos main nigerian raashtrapati gudlak jonathan ke saath baithak ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘ye badi samasyaayein hai lekin hamaara desh kaaphi bada he
 We will solve them
 ’ sunwaayee kii shuruyaat karte hue samiti ke adhyaksh jon vittingdel ne kaha ki durupyog vaale un krityon par se pardaa uthaaya ja chukaa he, jinhone desh ko stabdh or naaraaz kar diya he
 It is clear that Parliament has been misled
 shuru main madrek or james ne samiti ke samaksh pesh hone se inkaar kar diya tha
 But after the committee summoned him, he changed his mind
 mahanagar police ke nivartmaan pramukh paul stephenson se bhi house of kaamans kii samiti ne poochtacha kii
 He defended himself and denied that he had criticized UK Prime Minister David Cameron while resigning
 madrek ne kaha ki unhone aise koi saboot nahin dekhe hai ki 9 / 11 hamalon ke shikaar hue log unke akhbaar ke kaaran prabhavit hue hai
 He told the committee that he did not believe that the FBI had discovered any such evidence
 britain ke saansadon ne mahanagar police ke nivartmaan pramukh stephenson se is baat ko lekar kai sawaal kiye ki news aaf da world ke patrkaar nail walis kii mahanagar police main salaahkaar ke taur par kyon sevaayen lee gayin
 Wallis was arrested in a phone hacking scam
 unhone samiti se kaha, ‘is baat kaa andeh karne kaa koi kaaran nahin he ki walis kii jab sevaayen lee gayin us samay vah hekking main sanlipt the
 There was no conflict of interest at that time
 ’ press or police ke bich sambandhon ke bare main ek sawaal ke jawaab main 57 varshiya is police adhikari ne kaha ki yah behad spasht he ki ham jis tarah se kaam karte hai uske tareeke ko badalane kii jarurat he
 Stephenson resigned from his post on Sunday
 stephenson ne kaha ki istipha dene kaa faisla swayan unhone hi kiya tha
 Referring to the original investigation of hacking in 2006, the outgoing Police Commissioner said that he had no reason to believe that the investigation was a failure
 unhone kaha ki us samay vah unke liye praathamikta nahin thi
 Madrek's media group made public apologies twice last weekend in the phone hacking case
 company ne shanivaar or ravivaar ko desh ke akhabaaron main bhi maafee sandesh prakashit karaate hue apane patrakaron dwaara galat or aniatik tareeke apanaaye jane par kshamaa maangi
 Meanwhile, investigators continue to investigate the case of the death of former journalist of the News of the World Sean Hoer
 hoer ne hi sabase pehle phone hekking ke aarope lagaaye the
 Hoer was found dead in his home
 police ke anusaar unki maut ke kaarnon ko ab bhi spasht nahin kiya ja saktaa he lekin ise sandehaaspad bhi nahin mana ja saktaa
 Hoer was the first to accuse that the editorial of Andy Coulson was being misapplied in the newspaper
 madrek ke putr james ne phone hekking ke shikaar logon ke samaksh khed prakat karte hue kaha ki hekking ko jaij nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 To this, Rupert said, "james and i want to say how apologetic we are
" ’ lebar party ke saansad tom watson ke sawaalon kii bauchhaar par madrek chup rahe lekin unke putr james ne kai baar hastkshep karne kii koshish kii
 However, Watson made it clear that he wanted to hear the answer, not from James, but from his father

 Google ne kuch samay pehle Pixel 4 kaa ek tiger jari kiya tha
 Call it teaser or leaked, because the photo of the smartphone with square shaped rear camera module was leaked, which was shared by Google
 Apple is saal nae yphone launch kar rahaa he or nae yphone main isi tarah kaa camera modul diya ja saktaa he
 Google has also shared more information about Pixel 4
 is baar company Pixel smartfones main kuch nae fitures de rahi he
 According to the teaser, this time, Face Unlock and Motion Sense will be given
 phase analock aipal kii phase idi kii tarah hi lag rahaa he, kyonki ye front camera besd nahin he or iske liye alag se sensors die gaye hai
 According to Google, the company is working on motion sense
 company ne kaha he, ‘pichley paanch saal se hamaari team advanced technolji and projects team (ATAP) Soli par kaam kar rahi he, ye ek moshan sencing radar he
 This is the same radar that has been used for decades to detect planes and other large objects', although such a feature was previously offered on Sony Ericsson phones, although they did not work
 is feechar kaa kya kaam he or Pixel 4 main ye kis tarah kaam karegaa ye dilachasp hoga
 Actually under the motion sense, it is possible to control the smartphone without touching it
 hand movement se yugers phone chalaa sakate hai
 Google has written about it in its blog post, 'pixel 4 will be the first device in which Soli will be given, this will be our new motion sense feature, under which you can just skip your hand, skip songs, snooze alarms
 Or you can use the silence feature when a call is received
 yah sirf shuruyaat he or jaise samay ke saath Pixel behatar hote jate hai, moshan sens ke saath bhi aisa hi hoga’google ne kaha he ki Pixel 4 ke top main company dwaara banaaya gaya miniechar varjan laga hoga jo phone ke aas paas ke movement ko sens karegaa
 It has been merged with a unique software algorithm and hardware sensor so that it can detect the gestures
 sunne main ye feechar vaaki kamaal kaa lagata he or Pixel 4 ke saath ye or bhi ho saktaa he
 But the screw is that Google has also indicated that it will be for some countries only
 google pehle bhi aisa karata aayaa he, piksl smartfones ke kai fitures bharat main nahin hai or ye america ke kuch shaharon ke liye hi hai
 Now whether this motion sensed feature will come to India is a big question
 Google Face unlockgoogle Face Unlockke bare main baat karen to pehali baar company phase analock kaa feechar degi
 According to the company, Face Unlock can be like other smartphones, but it is designed differently
 company ne ye bhi kaha he ki duusare phone ko uthaanaa hota he phir ek tarah se uske saamne dikhnaa hota he phir swip karke home screen tak janaa hota he
 The Pixel 4 will be quite streamlined, as soon as you reach the phone through Soli, it will unlock the sensor and the algorithm will recognize you
 jaise hi wo elgoridm aapako pahachaanegaa or aap phone uthaaenge to ye analock ho jayega
 How will you hold the phone face unlock will work, even if you hold the phone upside down, it will work
 iske jariye sicyorothentication kiya ja sakegaa
 Google has also talked about privacy and said that all the data of facial recognition technology will remain in the user's phone and it will not go on Google's server
 Pixel 4 main Titanium m security chip diya jayega jahaan ye data sicyor rahegaa

 chhattisgarh main naksali hamale main maare gayi congressiyon kii shahadat ko chunaav me bhunaane ke liye ab congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi usee jagah ja rahe hai
 Rahul will rally in Jagdalpur on September 26 at the same place from where the Congress leaders came out
 gauratlab he ki 25 may ko jagadalpur main raily karke jaise hi congressi netaaon kaa kafila niklaa tha to darabha ghati main naksaliyon ne gherkar un par hamalaa kar diya tha
 In this attack, 25 people including Congress leader and state president Nandkumar Patel and their son, senior leader Vidyacharan Shukla and MLA Mahendra Karma were killed
 ab rahul usee jagadalpur main raily karke logon ko yaad dilaayenge ki kis tarah se congressi netaaon ne shahadat di or kaise raman singh sarkaar naksaliyon ko rokane main naakaam rahi
 Rahul will start his election campaign in Chhattisgarh with this rally

 In the 90-seat assembly in Chhattisgarh, this area is the most different and BJP won power by winning 12 out of the 13 seats here
 is baar congress yaheen par sabase zyada chot karnaa chaahati he
 The strategy of the Congress is to capitalize on the martyrdom of the tribal leader and Mahendra Karma killed in the attack
 isliye congress apni raily main karma ke bete ko agle ummidavaar ke taur par pesh karegi taaki adivaasiyon main ek bada sandesh ja sake
 Along with this, Rahul will also talk about the Land Acquisition Act here, as the tribals of this area have been opposing the acquisition and setting up of steel factories in the mines of Bailadila

 ' sansad main tripal talaak bill pesh karne ke baad kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki tripal talaak par lagaam lagane ke liye kanoon isliye jaruri ho gaya kyonki supreme court ke sakht faisle ke baad bhi desh main tripal talaak kaa maamla rukne kaa naam nahin le rahaa tha
 Ravishankar Prasad, arguing on the need to enact this law, put the central government's side on the matter
 jaane tripal talaak par ravishankar prasad kii khaas dalile1
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the Muslim Personal Law Board had said in the Supreme Court that the cleric who was married would advise both the husband and wife that he would refrain from using the term thrice for divorce
 2
 The affidavit given to the Supreme Court stated that the Personal Law Board would convince the Muslim community that there should not be three divorces in the country
 iske baavjood 2017 main 300 tripak talaak hue hai
 3
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki tripal talaak kii samasya kaa andaja isi baat se lagata he ki supreme court dwaara tripal talaak ko gaiyrkanoonee tehraae jane ke baad 100 se zyada tripal talaak ke maamle ho chuke hai

 6
 ravishankar prasad ke mutabik zyaadaatar islamic deshon main yadi talaak dena he to pehle arbitreshan council ko talaak dene kii vajah bataane kii jarurat hoti he
 In contrast, a secular state like India has lagged behind in terms of reform in Muslim society
 7
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that there is a law in Bangladesh that to give a divorce one has to first inform in writing
 yadi bina soochna ke kisi vyakti ne talaak diya he to uske liye 1 saal kii sajaa or jurmaane kaa praavdhaan he
 At the same time, a similar law exists in Pakistan
 8
 Legislation has been enacted in many countries like Afghanistan, Morocco, Egypt to regulate triple talaq
 jab islamic mulk teen talaak ko regulate kar rahe hai or kah rahen he ki ek baar main teen baar talaak nahin kaha ja saktaa he to bharat ko kyon is praavdhaan se alag rahane kii jarurat he
 9 Divorce has been made illegal
 iskaa asar mahilaon or bacchon par pad rahaa tha
 While women were being forced to come on the sidewalk, the mother's relevance to raising children was ending

 jammu-kashmir main pichley saal kii tarah is baar bhi barfbaari hui
 Before the threats of terrorists, this time snowfall on the distressed apple farmers brought more frustration than the previous time
 srinagar main seb kisaan tanwir kehete hai, kam se kam 60 pratishat seb is asamay hui barfbaari se khatm ho gaye
 Asked if the government will compensate the farmers for this loss, Tanveer says, "last year, the farmers had to pay Rs 600
 1500 ru
 And Rs 1000
 bataur harjaana diya gaya
 It was not even equal to the loss of a thong apple
 '' ve sebon ke bagaanon kaa hisaab bataate hai, ''ek acre main 7-8 kanal hoti he
 There are 15–17 trees in a canal
 ek ped main kam se kam 20 peti seb kii paidaavaar hoti he
 Now you tell me whether the compensation which the apple farmers got here was justified? It mocked the farmers by giving such money in the form
 nefed ne kisaanon se seb kharidne kaa elaan kiya tha, is sawaal par tanwir kehete hai, '' haa, or kharide bhi
 But if a farmer put 5,000 cases in front of the officers of Nafed, then only 100-150 boxes were selected by Nafed for purchase
 '' tanwir kehete hai agar sarkaar vaaki bhala karnaa chaahati he to nefde ko sthaneey kisaanon ke saath kerani mulaakaat or baithken kar khariddaari ke niyam tay karne chahie the
 but that did not happen
 rashtriya kisaan mahasang ke pravaktaa abhimanyu kohaad kehete hai, vaise to kisaanon kii haalat kahin thik nahin lekin jammu-kashmir ke kisaanon ke prati sarkaar ko or samvedansheel hona chahie
 Last month, terrorists targeted two apple traders from Punjab
 isamen ek kii maut ho gai
 Earlier, the terrorists shot the truck driver who was carrying the apple from Shopian to Rajasthan
 is driver kii bhi maut ho gai
 For the apples not to reach the mandis, threats are received daily
 is puure maamle ko lekar ham ghati ke sabhi jilon main is maheene baithak karne vaale hai
 This will include issues such as giving protection to apple farmers to bring apples to the market, and apple shopping by Nafed
 seb kisaanon ke liye sitambar main launch hui thibazar hastkshep lakshya yojanaisi saal sitambar main rajyapal satyapal malik ne srinagar main seb kisaanon ke liye bazaar hastkshep lakshya yojana (market intervation torget skim) ko launch kiya
 Under this scheme, apples are being procured from farmers at remunerative prices through the Central Government's Nodal Procurement Agency or NAFED
 lekin yah yojana bhi kisaanon ke nuksaan kii bharpai nahin kar paa rahi he
 After all, why are apple farmers of the valley so important? While launching the Jar Intervention Target Scheme, Governor Satyapal Malik himself presented the figures which can be inferred that the apple farmers of Jammu and Kashmir are so important Why is it? He said, Kashmir is the second largest apple growing center in the world
 desh ke 75 pratishat sebon kii paidaavaar jammu evam kashmir main hoti he
 This scheme will increase the earnings of farmers tremendously
 rajyapal ne kaha ki si-grad seb kul paidaavaar kaa 40 pratishat hai, maujuuda samay main prati kilo ke liye teen se saat ru
 Only farmers are able to get it, but after the implementation of this scheme, its value will be doubled and tripled per kg
 rajyapal ne kaha ki seb market turnover 8000 karod prati varsh he, or isse 7 lakh parivaar pratyaksh or apratyaksh rup se jude hue hai
 He said that more attention needs to be given to this sector
 unhone kaha ki ab NAFED kisaanon se sabon kii kharid karegaa or kisaanon ko har kism ke seb ke liye milane vaali keemten bad jaaegi
 Governor Satyapal Malik also warned militants who threaten apple farmers in Kashmir
 malik ne kaha ki aise log jald se jald sudhar jaaen, anyathaa sarkaar unke khilaaf kadi karrwai karegi
 Malik said, "we will protect and protect farmers, immediate action will be taken against those who are threatening the farmers
" " bataa den ki jammu-kashmir se anuchhed-370 khatm hone ke baad baukhalaahat main kuch asamaajik tatwon ne seb baahar bhej rahe kisaanon par hamale kii koshish kii he
 The following month, following the statement of Malik, the terrorists shot two apple traders from Punjab and also shot a truck driver carrying a truck full of apples to Rajasthan
 dhamkiyaan lagaataar seb kisaanon ko mil rahi hai
 Farmers were expected from Nafed, but Nafed officials who arrived in Bagan to buy apples are rejecting apples on the basis of quality

 ' Railway Minister Sadanand Gowda of the Narendra Modi government, while presenting his railway budget, also put the bitter truth of Indian Railways in front of everyone
 unhone bajet pesh karne ke dauraan saaf kaha ki mere purvavartiyon ko pataa tha ki railway kii haalat har din kharaab hoti ja rahi he
 But they kept on worrying about the applause ringing in the house
 gauda kaa kahana he ki pehle ke rail mantri project par project kaa elaan karte rahe, bina is baat kii parvaah kiye ki unhen puraa bhi kiya ja rahaa he yaa nahin
 Today's budget speech revealed the four bitter facts of Indian Railways
 1
 If Indian Railways earns 1 rupee, then 94 paisa of that is spent in operating the trains and sharing the salary
 bachate hai sirf 6 paise
 After paying the necessary dividends etc
 from these, many things have to be done like construction of new tracks, new safety measures, increase in passenger amenities
 yah kosh kitna khastahal he, use is aankade se samajhie
 After paying the required dividends and leases in the year 2007-08, the railways earned Rs 11,754 crore
 magar maujuuda saal main yah kamai ghatakar 602 karod rupee hi rah gai he
 2
 pichhali sarkaar ne project ko puraa karne ke bajaay bas unke elaan par hi apana dhyaan kendrit kiya
 In the last thirty years, 676 projects were announced
 inaki anumaanit laagat thi 1,57,883 karod rupee
 But only 317 were completed in these projects
 baaki 359 project latake pade hai
 Railways need Rs 1,82,000 crore to complete these projects
 3
 In the last ten years, the UPA government announced 99 new railway lines
 iske liye 60 hajaar karod rupee kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya
 But the reality is that only one of these projects has been completed so far
 gauda ne bataaya ki chaar project to aise hai, jo 30 saal se chal rahe hai or abhi tak mukammal nahin hue
 He said that the more projects we announce, the greater the burden on our resources
 behatar hoga ki projects ko ek niyat samay par puraa kar liya jaae or tabhi nae kaa elaan kiya jaae
 4
 pichley 10 saal main bhartiya railway ne 3,738 kilometre kii nai rail line bichaai
 For this, an investment of 41 thousand crores was made
 lekin jo pehle se hi lagaataar chal rahi line hai
 Resources were reduced to double them
 mahaj 5,050 kilometre line ko dabl kiya gaya or is par 18,400 karod rupee kharch kiye gaye
 This is when the government was repeatedly talking about improving, doubling, electrifying existing tracks

 " dilli ke lutian jone main modi sarkaar ne teen mukhyamantriyon ko bangala alot kiya he
 These bungalows have been given to the Chief Ministers of Bihar, Assam and Jharkhand

 Sarbananda Sonowal was allotted a Type 7 bungalow at 29 Canning Lane and Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghuvar Das also got a Type 7 bungalow at AB / 13 Mathura Road
 bataa den, supreme court ne lutian jone main mukhyamantriyon ko bangala alot karne par roak laga di thi
 But keeping the security in mind and in a special case, the central government can allot the bungalow
 court ke aadesh ke baad jin mukhyamantriyon ko sarkari bangala alot hua tha unase bangala khaali bhi karaayaa gaya tha
 In this, the bungalows were evacuated from the then chief ministers Harish Rawat and Virbhadra Singh
 is aadesh ke baad se sabhi rajyon ke mukhyamantri, rajyapal or mantri dilli aane par rajya sarkaar ke bhawan main rahete hai

 ek dashak ke prayaason ke baad aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana masood ajahar ko sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (yuanessi) ne vaishvik aatanki ghoshit kar diya he
 The special thing is that the Pulwama terror attack that India tried to declare Masood Azhar as a global terrorist, is not mentioned on the UN website
 14 farvari, 2019 ko hue is hamale main siarpief ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 After the Pulwama terror attack, the US, Britain and France had proposed that the Pulwama terror attack was mentioned in it
 is par china ko pulavama se aapatti thi
 Several rounds of talks were held between India, China and Pakistan
 baad main pulavama kaa sandarbh hataae jane ke baad china ne apana vito hataa liya he
 China has vetoed Masood Azhar four times
 bhartiya sutron ne bataaya ki bharat masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karaane ke liye 10 saal se prayaas kar rahaa tha
 Many proofs were given for this
 haal main hi pulavama aatanki hamalaa hua tha
 The act of declaring a global terrorist has been done not just by giving information about an attack but after giving all the evidence
 sutron kii kahana he ki ham masood ajahar kaa biodata nahin taiyaar kar rahe the, jisamen uske dwaara kiye gaye har aatanki hamale kaa zikr ho
 Our aim was to declare him a global terrorist and we have succeeded in this
 sanyukt raashtra main bharat ke rajdoot saiyad akbaruddin ne india today se baat karte hue kaha ki yah ek kootnithik or sabhi ko lekar kiya gaya prayaas tha, jisamen ham safal hue
 Akbaruddin, however, refused to reveal what was the story behind this crucial diplomatic victory
 unhone kaha ki ham 2009 se hi prayaas kar rahe the
 Now we have got success

 Mohammad Faisal said that the current proposal was agreed after all political objections, including the removal of attempts to link it to Pulwama
 pakistan ajahar par lage pratibandhon ko fouran lagu karegaa
 He has refused to accept it as India's diplomatic victory
 khayr jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki masood ajahar ko lekar china ke badale rukh kaa shrey america, britain or france ko bhi jaataa he
 This is a big achievement for India
 ab pakistan ko masood ajahar par karrwai karne ke liye majaboor hona padegaa

 america raashtrapati baraak obama ke bare main or khud unase baat karte hue, bhale electronic madhyam se hi kyon na ho, main us pankti kaa istemaal karne kaa lobh chhod nahin paa rahaa hum, jo maine narendra modi ke nikatatam purvavarti ke liye istemaal kiya he
 That is, history will assess them more generously than journalism
 agar aap antarrashtriya media ko padhein, khaskar america main, to udaar tippaniyon main bhi yahi lagegaa ki obama kabhi sahi kadam nahin uthaa sakate hai
 They are accused of speaking more than working, deviating from their goals, unable to get America's spoiled politics on the right path
 lekin sanbhalkar apni pari khel rahaa koi ballebaaj pari ke bich main shaayad yahi kahegaa ki ballebaaji par nahin, balki score board par najar daalo
 The media immediately declares its verdict, even serious commentators do not have the patience as much as any historian
 lekin saamne dikhne vaale tathyon par najar daalen, yaa jaisaa ki maine kaha, score board par gaur karen
 a good news is coming in the midst of European disappointment on the economic stage that the growth rate of the US economy is rising again, which 3
 5 pratishat tak pahunch gai he
 This is a big thing for the $ 19 trillion economy, which is bringing prosperity with increasing employment there
 videsh niti ke morche par bhi unhone badi sujh-boojh se iraq or afghanistan se sena hataane kaa kaam kiya or iageies ke khilaaf gathbandhan taiyaar kiya
 They are also beginning a new dialogue with Cuba and Iran
 iske alaava haal kii kai pahal, jo dhimi padati ja rahi thim, un par nae sire se dhyaan de rahe hai
 The new relationship with India is also one of them
 is prakaar hamen gaur karnaa hoga ki ganatantr diwas ke maukey par obama ek shaktishaalee or safal america raashtrapati ke rup main aa rahe hai, jinke paas bharat ke bare main spasht soch he
 In this special and detailed conversation on e-mail, he describes India as a natural ally, not a strategic partner
 yah zyada mahatvapurn baat he, kyonki ‘‘ranneetik’’ shabd kii simit sambhaavnaaen hai
 They see possibilities of mutual cooperation with India on a range of issues such as the fight against terrorism, climate change and Ebola
 obama ne antarrashtriya rishton main vyaktigat sambandhon ke mahatv par puche gaye sawaal kaa bhi khulkar jawaab diya
 He spoke to Babaki about his equation with Modi
 obama ne manmohan singh ke saath madhur sambandhon kii baat bhi sweekaar kii
 Obama realizes the warmth and informality in the conversation by realizing the high expectations of Modi and his public from "tea seller to prime minister"
 videshi netaaon ke maanakon ke hisaab se modi yuva netaa nahin hai, lekin bharat ke liye, khaskar kisi khandaan se taalluk na rakhane ke kaaran ve kaaphi yuva hai or ham unke tathaa obama ke bich acchhee dosti dekh sakate hai
 Since the leaders of many nations are now relatively young, they are more informal and address each other by first name
 udhaaharan ke liye british pradhanmantri david camran kehete hai ki obama unhen ‘‘bro’’ (dost) kahkar sambodhit karte hai
 We do not know how they have personal relationships, but Obama accepted Modi's invitation to be the chief guest on Republic Day
 ho saktaa he, jaisaa obama ne kaha ki hamaari grah dasha aakhirkaar mil rahi he
 His detailed talk: There was a warmth in relations with India earlier during your tenure as President
 apane pehle videshi daure main aap bharat aae the or pradhanmantri manmohan singh white house main sarkari mehmaan the
 Despite this, the perception is that New Delhi and Washington relations have weakened
 kya aap isse sahamat hai ki aapasi sambandhon ko jaldi majboot banane kii jarurat he? aap or pradhanmantri modi kya is disha main teji se aage kadam badha rahe hai?jabase main raashtrapati bana hum tabhi se donon deshon ke bich gaharaa sambandh bananaa meri videsh niti kaa mukhya hissaa rahaa he
 In my first official visit, i valued friendship with India
 raashtrapati banane ke baad shuru main hi maine bharat kaa daura kiya, kyonki meraa dridhtaa se maananaa he ki america or bharat ke bich sambandh 21veen sadi kii mahatvapurn saajhedaariyon main ek ho saktaa he
 We are natural partners
 donon hi bade loktantric desh hone ke kaaran hamaari takat hamaare nagarikon kii takat or unki kshamtaaon main nihit he
 Being an entrepreneurial country, we are global leaders in the field of new experiments, science and technology
 ranneetik rup se bharat kii bhugolic sthiti ko dekhte hue ham asia-prashanth kshetra main apni suraksha or samruddhi ko badha sakate hai
 When India and America work together, both countries and the world are more secure and prosperous
 isiilie jab maine pichley daure main bhartiya sansad ko sambodhit kiya tha to apane vichaar vyakt karte hue bataaya tha ki vaishvik chunautiyon kaa saamana karne main ham kis prakaar vaishvik sahyogi ban sakate hai
 While it is true that progress has not been made in this direction as per our expectations, but we have been successful in deepening indo-us relations
 pichley kuch varshon main hamane donon deshon ke bich vyapaar ko lagbhag 60 pratishat tak badhaayaa he or bharatiyon tathaa americanyon ke liye zyada rojgaar muhaiyaa karaae hai
 Our forces are conducting more joint exercises than before
 hamane aatankwaad ke khilaaf aapasi sahyog kaaphi had tak badhaayaa he or ham parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa prasar rokane ke liye aapas main milakar kaam kar rahe hai
 We are also cooperating in promoting the development of agriculture in Africa
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke saath mere nijee sambandh pragadh the or ve kareebi sahyogi the
 Now Prime Minister Modi's election and his commitment to a new chapter in mutual relations is giving us a new opportunity to increase our participation
 main chaahunga ki aakhirkaar grah dasha mil jaae taaki sansad main maine jo vichaar vyakt kiya tha, vah puraa ho sake yani bharat or america sachche global partner ban saken
 That is why i accepted the invitation as the first US President to become the Chief Guest on Republic Day
 yah mere liye bahut sammaan kii baat he
 i look forward to attending the 65th annual celebrations of the Indian Constitution along with President Pranab Mukherjee, Prime Minister Modi and the Indian public
 mujhe is baat kaa bhi garv he ki main bharat kaa do baar daura karne vaala pehla america raashtrapati hone ja rahaa hum or mere saath ek baar phir meri patni mishael bhi hongi
 While i understand the symbolic significance of this visit, i also see it as an opportunity in the direction of concrete progress with Prime Minister Modi
 ummid he ki ham donon deshon ke bich sambandhon ke itihaas main ek nayaa yug shuru kar sakenge
 What things are necessary for good relations between India and America? On the most basic level, the relations between India and America should be based on the same principles, on the basis of which we have good relations with other countries in the world
 iske liye aapasi sammaan bhi jaruri he, jahaan ham ek-duusare ke alag-alag itihaason or parampara ko sweekaar karte hue ek-duusare ke gunon kaa sammaan karen
 Identifying mutual interests is also necessary to strengthen mutual relations
 isamen do raay nahin ki jab ham saath milakar kaam karte hai or aage badhate hai to hamaare logon ko zyada naukariyaan or avasar uplabdh honge
 No two countries can agree on everything, so India and America can also disagree with each other
 lekin meraa vishwaas he ki ham kisi bhi tarah kaa matbhed rakhte hue bhi aapasi sammaan kii bhaavana ke saath kaam kar sakate hai
 Not only this, many of our mutual interests can subside differences
 iske liye acha samvaad or talmail jaruri he, na sirf donon deshon ke netaaon ke bich, balki donon sarkaron ke bich bhi
 When we as leaders agree on something, then our governments should also implement our decisions
 hamen yah tay karnaa hoga ki jo ham kahen, us par amal bhi ho
 In the case of indo-us relations, in my opinion there are many special areas where we can concentrate our efforts
 donon hi deshon main hamaara jor logon kii dainik jindagi ko behatar banane par he
 This includes creating jobs and employment opportunities, improving education, and creating greater opportunities for all people, including girls and women
 ham vyapaar, nivesh or ucch takneekee sahyog ke raste main aane vaali baadhaon ko kam karne kii disha main milakar kaam kar sakate hai
 American companies are willing to help build basic facilities
 ye buniyadi suvidhaayen bhartiya vruddhi main utprerak kaa kaam karengi
 We can work together in Prime Minister Modi's effort to improve the condition of Indian people in terms of clean air, adequate water and electricity
 isamen hamaara naagarik parmaanu samjhauta bhi madadgaar ho saktaa he
 We can also increase our security cooperation, including maritime security in the asia-pacific region
 or meraa maananaa he ki global partner banane kaa ek matlab yah bhi he ki ham duniya kii sabase jaruri chunautiyon main se ek jalwaayu parivartan kii samasya par milakar kaam karen
 How important is personal friendship in international relations? Please tell us your opinion about Prime Minister Modi
 duusare netaaon ke saath mere vyaktigat sambandh mahatvapurn hai, kyonki sarkaron ke bich aane vaale kathin muddon par ve aksar madadgaar ho sakate hai, jinka saamana amuman hota he, yahaan tak ki sahyogiyon or mitra deshon main bhi
 Prime Minister Modi's historic election clearly reflects the hopes and aspirations of all Indians
 unki apekshaaon main shaamil hai-aisi aarthik vruddhi jo samaveshi ho, acchhee sarkaar jo apane logon kii seva kare, or aisi shiksha jo bharatiyon ko kushal or yogya bana sake
 And Prime Minister Modi's brilliant life journey — rising above a tea seller to become Prime Minister — is a reflection of his determination to succeed in the Indian people
 sitambar main white house main pradhanmantri modi kaa swaagat karne main mujhe bahut khushi hui thi
 i invited him because i felt that it was necessary to meet him early in his tenure so that we could take full advantage of his new energy and his election expectations
 bharat ko badi uplabdhiyaan dilaane ke liye unka spasht najariya he
 i have been greatly impressed by his determination and his energy to overcome the roadblocks to achieve great economic growth
 main khaas taur se bharat-america sambandhon ko zyada majboot karne ke liye unki ichha kii saraahna karata hum
 During their visit, we had agreed on a joint approach to conduct our efforts rapidly
 bilashak, bharat kaa meraa daura usee nazariye ko aage badhaane ke maamle main ek acha avasar he
 i was accompanied by the Prime Minister during his visit to Washington
 martin luther king, junior kaa smarak dekhne kaa avasar mila tha
 Mahatma Gandhi was inspired to some extent by the basic ideals of establishing America
 badale main dow
 Martin Luther King also drew inspiration from Gandhiji and his commitment to bring about social change through non-violence
 duusare shabdon main bharat or america vividhtaon se bhare loktantric samaaj hai
 Both countries are trying to follow their basic ideals, but i believe that our ethnic and religious diversity is the source of our strength in our country and the world
 america ke saamne aane vaale bade muddon par raashtrapati obama kii kya raay he? kya hamaari bahustareey sansthaaen in muddon ke raste main aadchan hai?aaj hamaare raashtra or log pehle kii apeksha ek-duusare se zyada jude hai, isliye aaj kii duniya jahaan hamen asaadhaaran avasar detii he, vahiin tamaam chunautiyaan bhi khadi karti he, jinka saamana koi bhi desh akele nahin kar saktaa he
 That is why i am committed to building a better partnership bilaterally and multilaterally with India
 meraa maananaa he ki jab ham donon desh milakar kaam karenge to hamaare liye avasaron kaa laabh uthaane or aaj kii chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye acha mauka hoga
 Along with increasing mutual cooperation on a bilateral basis, we also have to ensure that multilevel institutions function effectively
 isiilie maine vaishvik aarthik nirnay prakriya main ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon-jinamein bharat bhi shaamil he-ko zyada mahatv dene ke liye ji-20 kii bhoomika badhaane par jor diya
 This is the reason why in my opinion, India should be included as a permanent member in the revised UN Security Council
 avasaron ke maamle main hamen vishwa arthvyavastha kii vruddhi ko banaae rakhana he
 i was happy that Prime Minister Modi and i succeeded in working together to achieve a major achievement in the World Trade Organization, so that negotiations on the global trade deal could resume
 loktantric desh hone ke kaaran hamaari jimmedaari he ki ham duusare deshon ke nagarikon ke saath khadey hon taaki ve loktantric bhavishya or maanavadhikaar hasil kar saken
 Techniques introduced by Indians and Americans, which often have mutual support, give us an unprecedented opportunity to improve people's lives
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki africa main krishi vikaas tej karne ke liye ham aapasi sahyog badha sakate hai, ibola jaisi bhayanak bimariyon se lard sakate hai or vaishvik swasthya ko behatar bana sakate hai
 Also can achieve the goal of ending terrible poverty around the world
 chunautiyon ke maamle main hamaari pehali jimmedaari he apane logon kii suraksha
 The United States and India can increase mutual cooperation in combating terrorism
