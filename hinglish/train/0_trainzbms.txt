 2014 main jab narendra modi ne piem kii kursi sanbhali to unhone apane kareebi amit shah ko bhi gujarat main nahin rahane diya balki unhen bijepi adhyaksh banaakar sanket de diya ki wo sarkaar ke saath saath sanghathan par bhi apni pakad dhili nahin hone dena chaahate
 Amit Shah's skillful strategy was said to be the reason behind the massive victory of BJP in the Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad kai rajyon main vidhansabha ke chunaav hue
 If the BJP won, then it had to face defeat
 modi ke 7, aarasiar aane par gujarat main anandiben ko satta saunpi gai thi lekin do saal bhi nahin beete ki siem badalanaa pad gaya
 From what happened on Thursday at Surat's meeting in Surat, there are signs that everything is not right in the state or that Amit Shah, who was once said to be 'hanuman of Modi', is getting broken
 patidarbahul surat main shah ke kaarykram main guuruuvaar ko jamkar hangaamaa hua
 Slogans were raised for Hardik Patel, then Amit Shah shouted back
 sabhi kursiyaan chalin
 Things got so bad that the four-hour-long program had to end in an hour
 yah kaarykram bijepi se jude patidaar samudaay ne shakti pradarshan ke liye kiya tha
 Its purpose was to show that the BJP still has the full support of the Patidars
 lekin hangaame ke dauraan surat kii sadakon par 'general diar waapas jaao' ke postaron se saaf ho gaya ki bijepi kerashtriya adhyakshaka asar ab kam ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, it is necessary to know the reasons for which Amit Shah or otherwise, the wind has started against the BJP in Gujarat
 1
 When Narendra Modi was the CM of Gujarat, there was no news of any tussle between the party and the government, but as soon as he went to Delhi everything started to disintegrate
 rajya main pratidwandi congress kii lokapriyata badhane lagi he
 2
 pichley dinon jab gujarat kii satta anandiben se lekar vijay roopani ko saunpi gai to party kii andruni kalah saamne aa gai thi
 In the meeting of the legislature party, Anandiben vetoed Rupani's name
 wo nitin patel ko lekar siem kii kursi saunpna chaahati thim
 However, after the intervention of PM Modi, Anandiben bowed down and Rupani was chosen as the leader
 3
 When Rupani was sworn in as CM, nine cabinet ministers who were considered loyal to Anandiben Patel were discharged in his cabinet
 4
 In October last year, protests took place across the state on the call of Patidar Amanat Andolan Samiti leader Hardik Patel
 halaat itane kharaab ho gaye ki tamaam ilaakon main karfu lagaana padaa
 Significantly, curfew was imposed in the state for the first time after the 2002 riots
 5
 Hardik Patel was jailed on charges of treason
 yah sanghathan patel samudaay ko obisi kaa darja die jane ke saath saath sarkari naukariyon or padhai main 27 fisadi aarakshan kii maang kar rahaa he
 6
 bijepi daawa karti he ki patidaar ab bhi unke saath hai lekin hardik patel ke andolan ke dauraan rajya sarkaar ne jis tareeke se puure maamle ko handle kiya usase is samudaay kaa bada varg bijepi se naaraaz bataaya jaataa he
 7
 gujarat ke dalit pichley 15-20 varshon se bijepi ko vot dete rahe hai
 Dalits are also included in Modi's Gujarat model
 lekin rajya main dalit utpeedan kii ghatnaayen pichley 10-15 saalon main badi hai
 Recently, in response to the Una incident and the huge rally of Dalits in Ahmedabad, there are signs that bjp's Dalit vote bank is starting to crack

 The International Cricket Council (ICC) Executive Committee on Monday recommended that the DRS system be compulsorily implemented in Test and one-day cricket

 Let me tell you that the story of the movie 'war' is from 'kabir' Hrithik Roshan and 'khalid' Tiger Shroff
 film main halaat kuch aise banate hai ki guru or shishy ek duusare se takaraane ko majaboor ho jate hai
 The disciple Khalid is used to tighten the uncontrollable guru, and then begins a tremendous action
 bike, car, helicopter, barf pahaad har jagah ection dekhne ko miltaa he
 Many tremendous twists have also been inserted in the story and the ending of the film has also been kept a bit surprising
 in sabase itar darshakon ko war (war) main bharpoor maatra main acshan or stants dekhne ko milegaa
 The Supreme Court's landmark verdict has come on the running of cases against officers of the rank of Joint Secretary and above
 supreme court kii sanvaidhanik bench ne kaha he ki bade afasaron kii jaanch ke liye ab sarkaar kii ijaajat kii jarurat nahin he
 It is worth noting that earlier the government had to take permission for the investigation of big officials
 sanvaidhanik bench ne dilli police ystablishment act ke section 6a ko khaarij kar diya
 According to this decision of the Supreme Court, permission will no longer be required to file the chargesheet
 court ke is faisle ke baad bhrashtachar jaise ahm maamle main sibiai kisi bhi adhikari ke khilaaf exiaar darj kar maamle kii jaanch kar sakati he
 Significantly, during the investigation of 2G scam and coal scam, the CBI had to get permission from the government for questioning the big officials
 jise lekar kai baar vivaad bhi hua
 In such a situation, this decision of the Supreme Court is very important

 Justice Khehar distanced himself from hearing the Sahara case ratan tata par phir hamalaa bolte hue samooh ke hataae gaye chairman sirus mistre ne in aaropon ko khaarij kar diya ki unhone samooh kii dudharu gaay maani jane vaali companiyon tisies or jeelar main koi yogadan nahin diya
 In contrast, Mistry accused group head Ratan Tata of attempting to sell the IT company to IBM
 unhone kaha ki ratan tata ne apane ‘ahankaar’ main kores jaise kharaab kaarobaari faisle liye
 Corus was acquired at twice the original cost
 mistre ke karyaalay se jari paanch prishth ke patr main kaha gaya he ki is maamle ko sidhaa karnaa jaruri he kyonki akshep or li sirf yah bhram paidaa karne ke liye kii ja rahi he ki mistre apane ko dur rakhane vaale chairman the or tisies-jeelar unke netritv main khud se aage bad rahi thim

 patr main is kaa zikr kiya gaya he ki namak se saftware kshetra kaa samooh is shandaar pradarshan kaa shrey lene main vyast he
 The letter said that Ratan Tata had once attempted to sell the group's 'nagina' company TCS to global giant IBM
 mistre ko 24 aktubar ko hataae jane ke baad ratan tata ko antarim chairman niyukt kiya gaya he
 However, no time for this is stated in the letter
 isamen kaha gaya he ki tatkaaleen pramukh epasi kohli kii beemaari kii vajah se jearady tata, ratan tata ke prastaav ko aage nahin badha paae the
 Mistry has said that Ratan Tata was leading the joint venture with IBM of Tata Industries
 unhone tisies ko ibiem ko bechney ke liye jearady tata se sampark kiya tha
 JRD refused to consider the deal as Kohli was in the hospital at the time
 tippaniyan However, Kohli, who is said to be a veteran of the domestic software industry, categorically rejected the offer, saying TCS had a bright future and the group should not sell the company
 patr main kaha gaya he ki iske baad jearady ne is peshkash ko thukraa diya tha
 The letter claimed that it was an 'almost death' experience for TCS from Ratan Tata
 mistre ke karyaalay dwaara jari spashtikaran ke kram main yah teesraa patr he
 It alleges that Ratan Tata took bad business decisions in 'ahem'

 iske ulat mistre ne samooh ke pramukh ratan tata par aarope lagaaya ki unhone iti company ko ibiem ko bechney kaa prayaas kiya tha
 He said that Ratan Tata took bad business decisions like Chorus in his 'arrogance'
 kores kaa adhigrahan mul laagat se doguna main kiya gaya
 a five-page letter issued from Mistry's office states that it is necessary to straighten out the matter as the attacks and leaks are being done only to create the illusion that Mistry was the chairman to keep himself away and TCS-JLR was his She was leading herself in leadership
 patr main mistre dwaara donon companiyon ke kaaryakari chairman ke rup main kiye gaye prayaason kaa zikr kiya gaya he jisaki vajah se in companiyon ne samooh ke munaafe main 90 pratishat kaa yogadan diya

 Huh

 The Delhi Commission for Women has resuscitated a girl living like a prisoner in her mother's house for seven months
 is ladki kii sirf itani galati thi ki isane apane mata-pita kii marji ke khilaaf shaadi kar lee thi
 This incident is from Khajuri Khas area of east Delhi
 ek din pehle raat ke teen baje ek vyakti ne dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati jaihind ke twitor handle par rajesh (naam parivartit) ne apni patni savita (naam parivartit) ko uske ghar se rescue karaane kii madad maangi
 Rajesh said that his wife has been imprisoned in the house for the past seven months by his own housemates
 subah hote hi dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati jaihind ne ayog kii mobile helpline kii ko-ardinator kiran negi ke netritv main ek team kaa gathan kiya or ladki ko rescue karaane ke liye bheja
 The Delhi Women's Commission team along with the police reached Savita's house
 jahaan savita or uskaa parivaar rahata he
 Initially, Savita was very scared of her family, so she was not saying anything
 ayog kii team dwaara uski counselling karne ke baad savita se sari baat bataa di
 Savita said that she is 20 years old and had a love marriage with a boy Rajesh in January 2017 against the wishes of her parents
 jiske baad donon noida main ek saath rah rahe the
 Savita said that her mother's health suddenly worsened in March and after her father's call she went to see her mother with her husband
 savita ke ghar jane ke baad uske ghar waalon ne use uske pati ke saath waapas bhejne se manaa kar diya or or rajesh ko vahaan se bhaga diya
 Savita's family also tore all the documents of their marriage and threatened to kill both of them
 savita ne bataaya ki 7 maheene se use ghar main kaid karke rakhaa hua tha use baahar jane kii anumati nahin thi
 There was always someone at home
 ghar ke baahar taala laga kar rakhaa jaataa tha
 On the other hand, the family members of Rajesh were also against this marriage
 isliye use apane parivaar se bhi koi madad nahin mil rahi thi
 Rajesh sought help from the UP Police besides the Delhi Police for help but did not get any help
 ladke ne bataaya ki usne 22 sitambar ko twitor par hi dilli va upi police ko apni shikaayat likhakar madad maangi thi lekin koi madad nahin mili
 Her efforts finally came to fruition when she sought help from the Delhi Women's Commission
 ab donon ek saath hai or donon ne police ko likh kar diya he ki yadi unke saath koi anhoni hoti he to iske liye donon ke maa-baap jimmedaar honge
 Delhi Women's Commission chairperson Swatijahind said that in the 21st century, it is happening in the country's capital Delhi that a girl who marries on her own will be imprisoned, she said that for the rights of women, there is too much a long battle is yet to be fought, he dares Rajesh, who did not give up and regains his wife

 It has been told from the office of Pranab that he did not get the information about the photo session while according to the sources of the Lok Sabha Secretariat, the information was being given in the Lok Sabha Bulletin for the last two months

 vot share main bhi donon ke bich maamuli antar dikh rahaa he
 Congress may get 41% and BJP 40%
 basapa ke 4 fisadi or anya ko 15 fisadi vot mil saktaa he
 In such a situation, if the Congress and the BSP had contested the elections, where the vote percentage would have been 45 percent, there could have been a big increase in seats
 aise main bijepi ko congress takkar hi nahin balki karaari maat dekar satta main vaapasi kar sakati thi
 In the exit poll of c Voter, ABP and Chanakya, the Congress seems to get an absolute majority
 jabaki times naao ke survey main bijepi satta main ek baar phir vaapasi kar rahi he
 However, in all surveys, the BSP and others are getting between 3 and 8 seats
 bataa den ki madhya pradesh main satta main vaapasi ke liye congress ne puri takat jhonk di thi
 There was talk of an alliance between the congress-bsp before the elections
 lekin mayawati ne gathbandhan na hone kaa thikra congress netaa digvijay singh par phoda tha
 After this, both the parties fought separate elections
 madhya pradesh ke chambal, bundelkhand or upi se sate jilon main basapa kaa acha khaasaa prabhaav he

 At the same time, in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly, the BSP is seen getting some seats

 Had the BSP jointly contested the Congress electoral ground, the seats could have increased even more

 Partial Solar Eclipse 2019: These are misconceptions about the intake of food in a partial solar eclipse
 grahan madhya- param grass- subah 10:42 par
 Eclipse touch ends- at 11:13 in the morning
 grahan samaapt- dopaher 12:21 par 
 Let us now know how Chandra Grahan happens
 yah to aap jaanate hi hai ki prithvi suraj kii parikrama karti he
 In this process, whenever the Earth comes between its satellite moon and the sun, the rays falling on the moon say the sun and the earth's shadow falls on the moon
 isi khagoleey ghatana se chand kaa dikhnaa band ho jaataa he or ise hi chandra grahan kehete hai
 How are eclipses, what are the practices related to this
 
 
 jaane is dauraan kya khaaen or kya nahin
 
 
 Kumbh 2019: 6 famous food bases of Prayagraj, where to go is made
 
 
 1
 According to Hindu belief, one should not eat food during Chandra Grahan
 logon main yah myth he yaa kahen ki manyama he ki is dauraan khaanaa khaane vaala insaan karne vaala nark main jaataa he
 2
 manyata he ki grahan ke dauraan agar pani pine kii jarurat he to usamen yaa to til daal len yaa phir kush, doob yaa tulsi ke pattey jarur daal len
 3
 zyaadaatar hindu gharon main grahan prarambh hone se pehle khaane ke saamaan, pani or anya bhojya padaarthon main doob yaa tulsi kii pattiyaan daal di jaati hai
 It is believed that food does not become impure by doing so
 4
 It is said that in the eclipse of the lunar eclipse, three meals should not be taken
 Lunar eclipse science: chandra grahan (chandra Grahan) ke sambandh main kai myth hai, jo logon ke bich faile hue hai
 There is a belief among people that viruses spread to the environment due to toxic radiations, which contaminate food
 yahi vazah he ki log grahan ke vakt falon, subjiyon ko kaatane se bhi bachate hai
 These 3 dry fruits full of protein can help in reducing belly fat - you can have light satvic food during this time
 jo pachne main aasaan ho or pet ke liye bhi halke hon
 During this time, you can take dry fruits in food
 yah kam maatra main khaane par bhi sharir ko puri energy denge
 Can you drink water during an eclipse? Drinking water should also be avoided during this period
 kyonki na hone ke chalate bacteriya active hote hai
 If you are sick or you are pregnant, you can drink light hot water
 isamen 8-10 bunde tulsi kaa zeus yaa pattey daal kar ubaal sakate hai
 In addition, if you do not want to drink plain water, you can drink coconut water
 sabase behatar yah hoga ki aap grahan se pehle hi acchhee maatra main pani pi len
 Benefits of Harad: Eliminates many diseases including hemorrhoids, constipation and inflammation, read- what not to eat during eclipse! According to the belief, non-veg diet should not be taken during this period
 is dauraan alcohole, khamir or hai protein food bhi nahin lenaa chahie
 It is very difficult to digest
 - grahan ke baad kya karen: grahan ke baad aap apni saamaanya diet par aa sakate hai
 Eating fruit after this will prove to be good
 yah isliye acha hota he kyonki falon main kaaphi maatra main antioxident hote hai jo sharir ko ditox karne main madad karenge or energy boost hogi

 bhartiya cinema ko niyantrit karne ke liye sensor board kii aavashyaktaa par bahes hameshaa jari rahegi, lekin kendriya film pramann board (sibiefasi) kii adhyaksh sharmila tagore kaa kahana he ki board filmon ke liye naitikta sikhaane vaali police kaa kaam nahin karata

 samay badal rahaa he or hamen bhi iske saath badalanaa padaa he
 He said, i believe in both censorship and freedom of expression, but along with this there should be legitimate restrictions
 udaartaa dikhaane badlaav lambe samay tak tikega
 Sharmila, 64, became the censor board chair in 2004
 jab se unhone yah kaam sambhala he tab se filmon kii saamagree, samvaad or kathy main kaaphi badlaav hua he
 The directors also made low-budget films like 'tere Bin Laden', while films with adventure themes like 'dev D' and 'love Sex and Cheat' were also made
 ek samay aisa tha jab filmon main abhadra shabdon ke istemaal par sensor board ko aapatti ho jaati thi, lekin ab 'omkara', 'kamine', 'ishkia' or 'no van kild jesica' jaisi filmon main gaaliyon kaa jamkar istemaal hua he, haa itnaa jarur he ki in filmon ko e-certificate mila, jiske chalate vayask log hi inhen dekh paae

 bollywood actress priyanka chopra kii bahan mira chopra ne ahmedabad ke ek five star hotel par kharaab khaanaa sarv karne kaa aarope lagaaya he

 com / hgty6d9ck2— meera chopra (@meerrachopra)august 23, 2019 For a few days, the heart and mind of a journalist who covered the Aam Aadmi Party could not understand one thing - after all, why Arvind Kejriwal is suddenly raising the flag against Narendra Modi with all the Lashkar? After all, why it seems from Kejriwal's talk that Modi is the biggest problem of the country at this time? aakhir kyon aam aadmi party se aise sanket mil rahe hai ki modi jahaan se ladenge, vahiin se kejariwal ummidavaar honge? After all, why suddenly Kejriwal is going to confront Modi at any cost? bahut soch-vichaar, chintan-manan ke baad main jo samaj rahaa hum or jo samajhane ja rahaa hum, vah kisi party netaa se hui baatcheet, yaa sutara ke hawaale se aayi khabar nahin he, balki ek reporter kii samaj he, vah reporter jisane pehle din se andolan cover karnaa shuru kiya tha
 But today is covering a political party
 asal main disambar 2013 main aam aadmi party dilli main shandaar pradarshan karne ke baad loksabhaa chunaav main zyaada interested nahin thi But if a political party was formed, then it was only to contest elections, so in the beginning it was decided that the party would field candidates for 100 -125 seats, but the question was why the public would choose Aam Aadmi Party? kyonki agar janata bijepi ko vot degi to usko narendra modi pradhanmantri ke rup main milenge, agar janata congress ko vot degi shaayad rahul gandhi pradhanmantri ke rup main mil jaaen, lekin aam aadmi jab lard hi chuninda siton par rahi he, sanghathan he nahin, gathbandhan to party kaa siddhant he hi nahin, to jab aap kii sarkaar banani hi nahin to janata vot kyon degi ? Then came the argument that just as the Janata JDU in Bihar, or the Trinamool in Bengal, the Biju Janata Dal in Orissa, Karunanidhi or Jayalalithaa's party in Tamil Nadu can vote by winning it in the same way
 is tark par chunaav ladaa jaae or janata se kaha jaae ki aap bhrashtachar mukt vyavastha ke liye hamako chunie or model ke rup main dilli ko dekhiye jahaan hamaari sarkaar he hamane vahaan kitna badhiya shashan diya he
 But the point was then that these are all regional parties, which do not have much at stake outside their state, whereas you are a national party which has to change the system in the whole country
 isliye lagaataar party ne apni ranneeti badali or ab jis trek par chal rahi he usko bataane ke liye main yah kahani suna rahaa hum
 In fact, the Aam Aadmi Party wants to strengthen its claim on the anti-modi and anti-bjp votes by first presenting itself as the biggest - bigger than the Congress - power against Modi
 isse party ko in chunaavon main to phayda ho saktaa he, saath hi aane vaale samay main vah khud ko congress kaa vikalp sabit kar congress kii jagah lenaa chaahati he
 That is, you will actually harm the Congress on the pretext of attacking BJP
 isse pehle bhi dilli main nichle tabake , avaidh colony, jhuggi aadi main jo paramparaagat voter congress ke the aap ne uskaa samarthan jutakar hi dilli main apratyaashit jeet hasil kii thi
 Kejriwal believes that Modi is really in the air at this time, but by colliding with him and contesting elections on a large scale, Kejriwal is trying to make the party's organization in the country on the pretext of Lok Sabha elections
 jab vot milenge to pataa chalegaa ki party kaa asar kahan tak he or kitna he 


 loksabhaa chunaav ke bahaane jansamarthan dikhegaa (agar he to ) or sanghathan khadaa karne ke baad vidhansabha chunaav yaa sthaneey nikaay ke chunaav ladane main aasaani ho sakati he
 On top of this, when Kejriwal himself will contest in front of Modi, it will strengthen his opinion that Kejriwal is a brave and fearless person who is directly fighting Modi when the wind is blowing in Modi's favor
 isse pehle dilli kii 15 saal puraani aparajit mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko shikast dekar kejariwal apni image aisi bana chuke hai 
 
 
 
 lekin kya kejariwal modi se jeet paaenge, koi jaankaar vaise aisa abhi nahin kah rahaa lekin jab koi vyakti itani badi ladaai ladata he to uski haar main bhi uski jeet ho jaati he
 
 
 
 
 a kind of respect in public is for the warrior who fights with a warrior greater than himself
 haalanki is masterplan ko lagu karnaa kejariwal ke liye aasaan nahin kyonki ek taraf unka apana masterplan he to duusari taraf party ke netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke apane plan hai
 There is increasing dissatisfaction and resentment among them for different reasons - if someone is not getting a ticket, someone is objecting to the way the party works, nobody likes to attack Modi instead of Congress
 Somebody is angry because people coming from outside in the party are directly contesting or getting big responsibility in the organization and old people are not getting the chance
 vaise bhi aam aadmi party ki vichaardhaara koi ek nahin balki kai vichaardhaaraon kaa sangam he
 Just as soon as the thoughts are there, something like this happens that news is made for a journalist like me
 sawaal bahut saare hai lekin in sawaalon ke jawaab yaa to party ke paas he nahin , yaa party jawaab thik dhang se dekar apane logon ko samajha nahin paa rahi he
 Well, there is still some time left in the election
 dekhte hai ki ye party chunaav main kya kuch kar paayegi or kya kuch is party main chunaav tak hoga
 Often, after giving birth to a child, the problem of growing stomach in women is very common
 saath hi pregnancy ke baad badha hua motopa kam karnaa mahilaon ke thodaa mushkil bhi hota he
 Because after giving birth to a child, the body of women becomes very weak
 isliye pregnancy ke baad badha hua vajan or pet kam karne main jaldbaaji kabhi naa karen, naa kisi dawaai kaa upyog karen jisase aapaki or aapke bachche kii sehat par galat asar pade
 Rather, you can reduce your stomach with the help of some home remedies

 2
 bachche ko stanpan jarur karaaen
 According to a study, breastfeeding helps to make milk, both fat cells and calories present in the body
 jisase bina kuch kare hi vajan kam ho jaataa he
 3
 bachche ko janm dene ke baad pine ke liye sirf garm pani kaa hi istemaal karen
 Because warm water not only reduces the stomach, but it also prevents the body from becoming fat
 4
 Wrap your stomach with the help of a warm cloth or belt

 Pakistan is pleading with the whole world for help on the Kashmir issue, but its hand is failing
 ab pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan phir se america raashtrapati donald trump ke saamne kashmir par dakhal kii guhaar lagaayenge
 But here too the plans of Pakistan do not seem to be fulfilled as the end of peace talks between the US and Taliban on Afghanistan has proved to be a setback for it
 pakistani media main prakashit report main kaha gaya he ki antarrashtriya maamalon ke visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki pakistan ke liye america or taliban ke bich kii vaarta kaa radd hona ek bahut badi chunauti he kyonki ab use america ke or zyada dabaav kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 America's focus is more on removing the issue of Pakistan from Kashmir than Afghanistan
 shanti vaarta radd hone se jhatkapakistan ne afghanistan main shanti kaa card kai baar khelaa
 He is believed to have an impact on the Taliban and is said to have played a role in bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table
 ise america ne bhi mana tha or is maahaul main pakistan ne yah dhamkee dene se parhez nahin kiya ki agar kashmir par uski nahin suni jaaegi to vah afghanistan main apni khaas bhoomika se haath khinch legaa
 But now, after the peace talks between the US and the Taliban have collapsed, this trump card is seen going out of the hands of Pakistan and analysts believe that it will have an impact on his Kashmir campaign
 imran khan bhi neuyork main bol chuke hai ki afghanistan main baatcheet se hi hal nikal saktaa he
 Myra Macdonald, an expert on terrorism in Kashmir, said that unless Pakistan takes the Afghanistan case to a conclusion, it will be difficult to respond to Indian action on Kashmir
 aise main vah ulajhakar rah gaya he
 Pakistani analyst for international affairs Zahid Hussain said that Pakistan has put a lot of effort in these talks (us-taliban talks)
 iskaa achaanak is tarah khatm hona mulk liye ek tagada jhatka he
 After the breakdown of US pressure on PAK, once again, the pressure of America is certain to come on Pakistan whose focus is on its agenda in Afghanistan rather than Pakistan's agenda in Kashmir
 afghanistan or america lambey samay se aarope lagaate rahe hai ki pakistan taliban aatankiyon ko panaah detaa he jisase pakistan inkaar karata rahaa he
 Security expert Rahimullah Yousafzai said that after the talks broke down, it is now possible that the US will put pressure on Pakistan to rein in the Taliban
 yah ek baar phir pehle kii hi tarah pakistan ke liye 'kuch or prayaas karo' vaali sthiti ban gai he

 obama ke vaadon par romany ne kaha, ‘main jaanata hum ki raashtrapati ne kaha he ki vah vaada nibhaayenge
 But they did not
 vah nahin kar sakate or na hi karenge
 And he has proved it in his four years in the White House

 The captain believes that the inclusion of two more teams in the IPL will make this match more difficult
 unhone kaha ki ipel din pratidin or acha hota ja rahaa he
 Its level is increasing further
 khilaadiyon ko agle saal or zyada pasinaa bahaanaa padega kyonki atirikt samay hoga or iske liye aayojakon par iskaa zyada dabaav hoga
 Dhoni said that the team players had gathered only ten days before the IPL started and all of them quickly adapted themselves which made it easier to win the title
 dhoni ne kaha ki ham andrew flintaff jaise chotii ke khilaadiyon ke bina bhi acha khele

 While the ruling Aam Aadmi Party is continuously making ludicrous promises, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has also intensified its election preparations
 aam aadmi party sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue bijepi ne kaha ki kejariwal sarkaar ne chunaav se pehle lollypop diya, lekin use bhul gaye
 The government is constantly lying on irregular colonies

 Delhi BJP state president Manoj Tiwari said that we are trying not to confuse the people of Delhi and all the mps will put their views in different ways to inform the people about the failure of the government here

 On the issue of regularizing the irregular colony, Harshvardhan said that the Delhi government has been continuously lying in this regard
 2014 main jab modi sarkaar bani to cabinet ne faisla liya ki dilli kii aniyamit colony par cat of date 1 june 2014 ke hisaab se dilli sarkaar ko kaam karnaa he
 Harshvardhan said that when Arvind Kejriwal's government came to Delhi in 2015, the central government told him that the cut-off date was to work as per June 1, 2014, but the Delhi government did nothing
 2017 main dilli sarkaar ne kaha ki wo ye kaam 2019 tak karenge or phir 2019 main dilli sarkaar ne centre sarkaar ko chitthee likh kar kaha ki wo ise 2021 tak puraa karenge
 Referring to the failure of the Kejriwal government of Delhi in the case of the 'colonies, the Congress also gave a lot of lollipops', Harsh Vardhan said that the Central Government has now decided that the Delhi Government has repeatedly postponed the matter
 The Government of India will now complete this work
 kendriya mantri ne aam aadmi party ke alaava congress ko aade haathon liya
 He said that Congress also gave a lot of lollipops to the people before the elections and then forgot it
 bijepi kii pisi main congress or aam aadmi party donon hi dalon par hamalaa kiya gaya
 Harshvardhan said that for the first 15 years, the Congress government and now for 5 years, the Kejriwal government has only deceived the people of Delhi in the name of regularizing irregular colonies
 2016 main bharat sarkaar ne dilli sarkaar ko do patr likhakar anaadhikrut coloniyon par jaankaree maangi thi lekin inkaa aaj tak koi jawaab nahin diya gaya
 He said that in view of the lack of response and the lethargy of the government, a committee under the Lieutenant Governor (LG) was formed this year to regularize unauthorized colonies by the central government
 kejariwal sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue harshavardhan ne kaha ki janata aapako tex isiilie nahin detii ki aap khub apana prachaar kar karen

 Vinesh Phogat, the youngest and most promising 21-year-old of Haryana's famous Phogat sisters, is focused on the "gold medal" and is the Indian wrestling team's biggest hope for Rio
 unki ankhon main hameshaa swarna padak jeetne kaa khwab tairta rahata he, or yah unhen khub mehnat karne ke liye prerit bhi karata he
 Full of confidence, she says excitedly, "I will bring the medal, otherwise i will not return to India

 Vinesh does not remember that he ever did anything other than wrestling

 She says, "I was only four, maybe five years old when Tauji took me to the wrestling arena with my siblings and cousins
" " inamen chah bahanen—gita, babita, priyanka, ritu, vinesh or sangeeta or 15 chachere bhai shaamil the
 Phogat in Haryana's rigidly patriarchal, Jat-dominated Bhiwani district are liberal-minded people who encourage their women and young girls like Vinesh to try the traditionally male-dominated sports
 ve apni betiyon ko kinhin myanon main beton se kam nahin maanate or samaan parvarish karte hai
 Vinesh Phogat says, "I have fought more boys than girls in village riots
" " ve bataati hai ki kaise unhen akhaade kii mitti, dhul-paseene, chot, kade prashikshan or dukhte sharir se pyaar ho gaya tha
 The same hard work paid off and today she has become the master of this sport and has made her place among the well-known wrestlers of the country
 lekin abhi kuch samay pehle tak unka man ashankit rahata tha
 In April, he was disqualified at the World Qualifying Tournament in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia for his weight over 400 grams
 aisa laga ki unka olympic kaa sapana paravaan chadhgaye se pehle hi chakanachur ho jayega, lekin saubhaahgya se unhen sirf chetavanee dekar chhod diya gaya tha
 He then did one day and night and worked hard

 Drinking water is also gaining weight
 " lekin in baton se olympic par sadha unka nishaanaa nahin dagamagaataa or ve anjayas main koi kor-kasar nahin chhodti hai
 Vinesh Phogat is confident that she will win the medal
 unka sara dhyaan chamchamaate swarna padak par tikaa he
 He believes that the final round of wrestling during the Glasgow Commonwealth Games was by far the toughest match in which he had to go through a tough match
 us maukey ko yaad karte hue unke chehre par halkaa-sa tanaav aa jaataa he ''main bahut dabaav main thi
 "however, immediately the memory of the gold medal adorned on the neck spreads the same confident smile on his face

 ) The Shiv sena-ncp-congress coalition government in Maharashtra will crown the head of the Thackeray Chief Minister, the way has been cleared for the formation of a Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra
 shivasena ne aditya thakare ko aage kar chunaav ladaa tha, lekin ab sthiti badal gai he
 After the end of the relationship with the BJP, the Shiv Sena is forming a government with its anti-political parties - Congress and NCP
 is tarah se ab thakare parivaar maharashtra kii raajnneeti main kingmekar nahin balki king banane ja rahaa he
 Keeping the government in sync with politicians like Sharad Pawar and keeping a strong opposition like BJP in mind, Uddhav will be no less than a crown of thorns on Thackeray's head! Shiv sena-ncp-congress government with NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Congress veteran and veteran leaders It is not easy for Uddhav Thackeray to run a coalition government
 wo bhi tab jababijepi jaisaa majboot vipaksh samnehai
 Not only this, the Congress and NCP did not agree on the name of making Aditya the CM till the end
 yahi vajah he ki shivasena ne aditya ke bajaay uddhav thakare ko siem banane kaa daanv chalaa he
 Read
 
 LIVE - Political stir in Maharashtra, churning in the name of CM
 
 
 uddhav thakare sahyogi dalon ke saath behatar dhang se sarkaar chalaa sakate hai, ve bijepi jaise majboot vipaksh se bhi nibatna jaanate hai
 However, this will be the first time that the Thackeray family will leave the role of kingmaker and take direct power
 aise main thakare parivaar par vipaksh sidhaa hamalaa karegaa, isse thakare parivaar or matoshri ke us rutabe main kami aa sakati he, jiske dam par shivasena kii raajnneeti chalati he
 With the Thackeray family in power, it will now be easier for opposition parties to target him
 thakare ke sar sajega CM kaa tajdarasal maharashtra kii raajnneeti main thakare parivaar kaa alag rutaba or pahchaan he or rajya main unki barabari main koi anya parivaar khadaa nahin ho sakaa
 The main reason for this has been believed that even though the power remained around this family, this family always stayed away from power
 ab pehali baar hoga ki jab satta kii kaman thakare parivaar ke haath main hi hogi
 In such a situation, it has to be seen whether Uddhav Thackeray remains the chief of the Shiv Sena along with the CM or hands over the command of the party to Aditya
 uddhav thakare kaa siyaasi safarshivsena kii neenv 1966 main uddhav ke pita bala sahib thakare ne rakhi thi
 As long as Balasaheb Thackeray remained active in politics, Uddhav stayed away from the political scene or was seen standing behind him
 haalanki uddhav party kii kaman sanbhaalane se pehle shivasena ke akhbaar saamana kaa kaam dekhte the or uske sampadak bhi rahe
 However, later, due to Bal Thackeray's growing age and ill health, he started looking after the party's functioning after 2000
 2002 kii jeet se badha kadsaal 2002 main brihanmumbai municipal corporation (biemasi) ke chunaavon main shivasena ko joardaar safalataa mili or iskaa shrey uddhav thakare ko diya gaya
 Bal Thackeray then handed over his political legacy to Uddhav
 janvari 2003 menudhav ko shivasena kaa kaaryakari adhyakshabana diya gaya
 The low-profile Uddhav Thackeray was surprised when Bal Thackeray was chosen as the successor to the Shiv Sena, as people outside the party did not even know his name and Raj Thackeray was known as a possible successor
 par bal thakare ke apane bete uddhav ko uttaradhikari chune se aahat raaj thakare ne 2006 main party chhod di or nai party- maharashtra navnirmaan sena kaa gathan kiya
 Born in Mumbai on July 27, 1960, Uddhav's family consists of two sons Aditya and Tejas, apart from wife Rashmi Thackeray in Mumbai
 unka bada betaa aditya dada or pita kii tarah raajnneeti main sakriy he or shivasena kii yuva sanghathan yuva sena kaa rashtriya adhyaksh he
 Aditya Thackeray was further contested by Shiv Sena, but after the result, the political atmosphere became such that Uddhav Thackeray himself had to come forward from Kingmaker to become King
 maharashtra main 2014 main narendra modi ke centre main aane se pehle shivasena maharashtra main endie main bade bhai kii bhoomika main rahati thi, lekin iske baad bijepi vahaan bade bhai kii bhoomika main aa gai
 The Shiv Sena could not become its chief minister after the alliance's victory in the assembly in 2014
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav or vidhansabha chunaav shivasena ne bijepi ke saath milakar ladaa, lekin siem pad par daavedaari ke baad donon kii 25 saal puraani dosti tut gai
 After this, Shiv Sena has decided to form a government with the Congress and NCP
 gambhir aarthik sthiti or raajnneetik chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke bich congress kaarysmiti kii somvaar ko hone vaali baithak main party nit samprag sarkaar ko majbootee pradaan karne ke liye ek ranneeti laaye jane kii sambhaavna he
 The meeting will be chaired by Congress President Sonia Gandhi and will include Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and top ministers and leaders
 is baithak main ek prastaav paarit kiye jane kii sambhaavna he, jisamen jaruri vastuon kii badhati keemton se prabhavit aam aadmi ko raahat pradaan karne ke liye prabhavi kadam uthaane kaa aahvaan kiya jayega
 The comparison of the economic situation is going on since the year 1991

 The meeting is being held at a time when Anna Hazare and Ramdev are fasting in the capital Delhi on the issue of corruption
 aise main jab raashtrapati chunaav agle maheene hona nirdhaarit he, party ke varisht netaaon kaa kahana he ki samprag ummidavaar ke bare main nirnay sonia kii ore se anya partiyon ke saath salaah mashvire ke baad kiya jayega or is par kaary samiti main charchaa ho sakati he

 Dr

 Asked what his future course of action would be on the issue, he said, "it is necessary to ensure that such an incident does not happen again
" ’vipaksh ke nishane par rahane vaale pradhanmantri ne kaha ki yah gathbandhan kii baadhyataa se judaa maamla nahin he
 He said, 'I agree that it is not linked to the compulsion of the alliance
 maine pehle hi kaha he ki main ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirnay kaa sammaan karata hum
 The Prime Minister said, "I certainly believe that the Supreme Court has given this decision and as a patriotic citizen, i accept it
" main is faisle kaa sammaan karata hum or apni jimmdari sweekaar karata hum

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne rajyapal se milakar apana istipha de diya he
 With this, the grand alliance formed 20 months ago has also been broken
 nitish kumaar ke bare main mana ja rahaa he ki unhen bijepi kaa samarthan mil saktaa he
 If this happens, then Nitish Kumar's Chief Minister's chair may be saved, but Nitish will have to bear the brunt of breaking the grand alliance
 1
 Nitish will remain in power with the support of BJP
 lekin kya wo 'modi yug' main bijepi ke saath hokar apane faislon ko bihar main lagu kar paaenge? kyonki haal ke dinon main jin rajyon main bijepi kshetreey dalon ke saath satta main bhagidaar rahi, vahaan kshetreey partiyaan kamjor hui hai
 In such a situation, in addition to running an alliance with BJP, it will be a challenge for Nitish to maintain his political ground

 Nitish Kumar definitely had an advantage in staying with Lalu Yadav
 kyonki lalu yadav jis tarah se ghotaalon ke kai maamalon main ghire hai isse unki nijee sakriy raajnneeti kii raah aage bhi aasaan nahin he
 In such a situation, Nitish would always be on the front foot in alliance with RJD, and Lalu might not have any objection
 pichley do saalon main ye dikhaa bhi he ki lalu yadav ne kabhi nitish ke faislon par sawaal nahin uthaaya

 jis tarah se nitish kumaar kii aguwai main mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar ne bihar main do saal kaa safar bina kisi vivaad kaa tay kiya he, usase nitish kumaar kaa bihar ke baahar bhi kad badha tha
 In other non-bjp-ruled states, like the nitish-lalu alliance, regional parties were thinking of coming together on one platform, Nitish's decision to step aside is over before the foundation of the grand alliance in other states is over
 khaskar uttar pradesh main iskaa asar padegaa

 nitish kii ore kshetreey partiyon ke alaava congress bhi ummid kii najar se dekh rahi he, kyonki 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se jis tarah congress dinon-din kamjor padati ja rahi he aise main bihar ke baahar bhi nitish kii raajnneetik pakad or majboot ho sakati thi
 Not only this, if Nitish had come out in front of the BJP and Narendra Modi, then he could have joined the Congress along with all the regional parties
 ve modi ke mukaable piem pad ke ummidavaar bhi ho sakate the

 bihar main bhale hi aregedi ke 80 vidhayak hai, lekin lalu yadav aakhri vakt tak mahagathbandhan ko bachaane kii koshish karte rahe
 However, he was currently denying the agreement on Tejashwi's resignation
 lekin unhen pataa tha ki agar nitish gathbandhan se alag hote hai to argedy kaa raajnneetik astitv par sawaal khadey ho saktaa he
 But it is also true that the way the JDU-RJD separated from the BJP 2 years ago, the strength of the BJP had increased, and along with Lalu, Nitish's political future was also getting hit
 aise main nitish kaa lalu se alag hona ek bada or khataron se bharaa faisla ho saktaa he

 :(— Bana de Lohagarh (@kamleshksingh)march 8, 2015 Vice President Venkaiah Naidu has paid tribute to the demise of Congress leader Jaipal Reddy and former Union Minister Sushma Swaraj
 venkaiya naidu ne kaha he ki ye donon unke sage bhai bahan kii tarah the
 The Vice President has said that he has lost two best friends within just 10 days of his death
 uparashtrapati ne kaha he ki donon maujuuda samay ke behtareen saansadon, yogya prashaskon or kushal vaktaaon main se the
 In an article written in a newspaper comparing the two, the Vice President has said that there were many similarities between the two, in the sense that both fought their own incompetence
 uparashtrapati ne likhaa he ki reddy ne jahaan shaareerik aakshamata ko haraaya, vahiin sushamaa swaraj ne saamaajik aakshamata ko parrast kiya
 Venkaiah Naidu writes, "gender discrimination is a major issue in our socio-political life even today, which causes women to face many difficulties, but Sushma Swaraj denied it, like Jaipal, she also expressed her words, deeds and achievements
 Overcame formidable social barriers
 " naidu kehete hai ki haryana kii roodhiwaadee saamaajik-vyavastha main janm lene ke baavjood sabase kam umr kii cabinet mantri bananaa phir apana kaarykaal puraa karne vaali pehali videsh mantri bananaa koi choti uplabdhi nahin he
 Explain that during the funeral of Sushma Swaraj, when the Vice President reached the crematorium on Lodhi Road, he wept in front of Sushma's body
 rajyasabha main sushamaa ko yaad karte hue unhone kaha tha ki ve unhen apana bada bhai maanati thim or unhen anna kahkar bulaati thim
 Venkaiah said that Sushma used to tie rakhi to him on Raksha Bandhan every year, but this year his wrist will remain dry
 apane lekh main venkaiya naidu ne likhaa he ki jab wo sushamaa ko antim sammaan dene ke liye gaye the to unki beti bansuri foot-footkar rone lagi
 The Vice President recalled his dialogue with the flute in this article
 unhone kaha ki sushamaa apni beti ko bataaya karti thi, "main jab bhi venkaiya se milti hum to bephikr ho jaati hum, kyonki koi bahan jaise apane bade bhai ko sari samasyaayein bataakar chintamukt ho jaati he usee tarah main bhi unase milakar apni mushkilon se baahar nikal aati hum," venkaiya naidu aage kehete hai, "krur niyati ne ek snehi bahan mujhase chin liya
 "venkaiah says that the speech styles of Jaipal Reddy and Sushma Swaraj were given by God
 unhone kaha ki jaipal reddy kii angreji bhashaa par asaadhaaran pakadi thi to sushamaa swaraj kii abhivyakti kii spashtataa or unki bhartiya samskruti kii samaj unhen shandaar vaktaa banaati thi
 In Karnataka Assembly elections, there is a screw up for forming a new government due to no political party getting a clear majority
 is chunaav main 104 siten jitkar sabase badi party bani bijepi ne yediurppa ke netritv main sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya he
 After meeting the Governor of Karnataka Vajubhai Vala, he said that he will take oath as Chief Minister tomorrow
 ab bijepi kii koshish he ki congress or jedies milakar bhi bahumat ke liye jaruri 112 sadasyon kaa samarthan patr rajyapal ko na de saken
 However, the seats that these two parties have won are more than the majority
 buudhvaar ko congress vidhayak dal kii baithak main party ke 4 vidhayak nahin pahunche
 Apart from this, two JDS mlas also disappeared from their party meeting
 in vidhayakon ke bijepi ke sampark main hone kii bhi baat kahi ja rahi he
 Along with this, an independent MLA has also supported BJP
 vahiin, kumaraswami ne do vidhansabha siton se vijay hasil kii he
 Therefore, the BJP will pressurize the governor to resign from one of the two seats before the Kumaraswamy trust vote
 bijepi chaahati he kikarnatakake rajyapal vajubhai vaala sabase badi party yani bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa or vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne ke liye vakt den
 There is a plan to keep at least 15 of the Congress and JDS mlas absent during the trust vote in the assembly
 isse sadan main sankhya bal 222 se ghatakar 207 ho jayega
 After this, the BJP will easily prove a majority on the strength of its 104 mlas
 bahumat kaa jaadui aankada 112 se ghatakar 104 par aa jayega
 Not only this, BJP is also trying to make Lingayat respect an issue
 sutron kii maane to bijepi congress ke lingayat vidhayakon ke sampark main hai
 For this, the party is in touch with Lingayat Maths, so that the legislators of Lingayat community get in touch with Yeddyurappa
 is baar congress ke 21 or jedies ke 10 vidhayak lingayat samudaay se hai

 bhavik bansal back-tu-back desh ke top medical pravesh parikshaon main top ranker bane hai
 When he was number one in the AIIMS MBBS entrance examination, he got the second rank in NEET
 bhavik kii is safalataa main khaas baat ye he ki baaki medical or ejineering main top aane vaale chaatro kii tarah bhavik shuru se top rankers rahen ho aisa nahin he
 In conversation with NDTV, Bhavik tells that he never came first in his school or class till the tenth
 haa, gyarahavin se padhai ko lekar bhavik ke rukh main kaaphi badlaav aayaa
 The reason was that in the 11th he got a chance to choose the subject of his choice and then he started doing well
 bhavikbataate hai ki wo apane liye chote-chote target set karte or unhempoora karte
 But here you also have to keep in mind that if your goal is medical entrance exam and if you are not able to get very good marks in 12th, then do not add it to your reputation
 ames or neet kii taiyaari ko lekar apni stritegi share karte hue bhavik bataate hai ki donon ke liye taiyaari main aapako kuch basic baton kaa dhyaan chahie
 In NEET, you can expect questions like previous years, but do not expect this in AIIMS
 ames main aapako zyada creative hona padegaa or iske liye theory par bahut acha cmand hona chahie
 Yes, if you want to do neet then you have to do the questions which have come in the last years
 yahaan tak ki ames ke sawaal kitne mushkil hote hai ye samajhnaa bhi he to bhi aapako pichley saalon ke sawaal se bahut sahaayta nahin milegi
 Because the questions that come to you are based on memorization and there is a lot of scope to ensure that the questions are presented correctly
 bhavik kehete hai ki agar aapako ames karnaa he to aapako jeii kii kitabon or pichley saalon ke sawaalon kaa sahaara bhi lenaa chahie
 If you are preparing for Biology in terms of NEET, then there is a need to work more hard on Physics and Chemistry for AIIMS
 physics kii stritegi par vistaar main jate hue bhavik bataate hai ki ames main 70-80 pratishat sawaal 12veen se puche jate hai, par khaas baat ye he ki lagata to ye he ki sawaal modern physics se puche ja rahe hai par usamen makenix ke bhi concepts bhi lage hote hai
 That is, if your concepts are not very good then it will be difficult to solve that kind of question
 ab agar chemistry kii baat karen to bhavik kaa maananaa he ki ames ke sawaalon ko hal karne ke liye ensiiarti kaaphi nahin he
 Bhavik used MS Chauhan's book for organic chemistry
 iske alaava bhavik kaa maananaa he ki jeii mens ke sawaal karnaa bhi phydemand rahata he
 If you talk about physical chemistry, then it will become easier if you have already read physics well
 biology kaaphi kuch neet kii tarah kaa hi hota he or ensiiarti se hi adhiktar sawaal aate hai
 Now if we talk a little bit from studies, Bhavik tells an interesting thing about himself, which you will not find in most toppers
 bhavik kehete hai ki wo 5 minute se zyada phone se dur nahin rah sakate or medical kii pravesh pariksha ke dauraan bhi bhavik ne smart phone kaa istemaal kiya
 But yes, he did not waste his time on this but would rather share difficult questions with his friends and take it as a challenge
 bhavik kaa kahana he aapako karant afares par bahut zyada dhyaan dene kii zarurat nahin he
 Especially a lot of people say that after neet there is a time of 20 days for AIIMS, it should be looked at in current affairs, but Bhavik's advice is that in these days also you should concentrate more on physics
 dilli ke rahane vaale bhavik ab ames dilli main jane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai

 In the 80 Lok Sabha seats of Uttar Pradesh, there has been a huge stir between the parties of the Grand Alliance on the claim
 pehle khabar ai ki pradesh main seat shering ko lekar samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ke bich sabakuch tay ho gaya he or donon ek gathbandhan main saath ladane ke liye taiyaar ho gaye hai
 Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Congress President Raj Babbar has broken the silence on the matter saying that neither of the two parties has formally announced the SP and BSP alliance
 saath unhone kaha ki congress pradesh sabhi 80 loksabhaa siton par taiyaari karegi
 Raj Babbar said that the talk of an alliance between the two parties is just a rumor and nothing else
 unhone kaha, 'akhilesh yadav kii sarkaar ko satta se gaye kitne saal ho gaye hai
 i am sure he will make a good statement on this
 abhi tak kisi bhi steke holder ne seat shering ko lekar koi baat nahin kahi he
 So far all the things that have come to the fore are being told only by sources who are completely rumored
 'media reports kii maane to beete shuukravaar ko samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav or bahujan samaaj party supremeo mayawati ke bich lambii baithak hui
 According to sources, in this meeting, the two agreed on about 71 seats
 sutron ke mutabik is baithak main yah tay hua ki sapa pradesh kii 35 loksabhaa siton par or basapa 36 loksabhaa siton par chunaav lard sakati he
 At the same time, it was decided to give 3 seats to the National Lok Dal and to reserve 4 seats
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki is baithak main donon ne amethi or raibareli se apane ummidavaar na utaarne par sahamati jataai he
 However, the Congress has dismissed the possibility of any such alliance and said that neither of the two parties has spoken to the coalition and seat sharing formula directly
 bataa den ki ek din pehle rajyasabha saansad or samaajawaadee party ke mahasachiv ramgopal yadav ne bhi kaha tha ki sapa or basapa ke bich kisi prakaar ke samjhauta kii unhen jaankaree nahin he
 He said that he does not know whether there was a conversation between the two leaders
 saath hi ramgopal yadav ne kaha koi bhi ghoshnaa hogi to vah mayawati or akhilesh yadav dwaara kii jaaegi
 Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh while talking to India Today on this issue said that any alliance formed will be against BJP, because the country wants change
 uttar pradesh bhaajapa ke pravaktaa rakesh treepathi ne kaha ki sapa or basapa main gathbandhan karne kii bechaini spasht ho rahi he
 He reminded that BSP did not win a single seat under the leadership of Mayawati in the 2014 general election
 unhone kaha ki samaajawaadee party bhi keval saifai se 5 siten jeet pai thi, jo keval unke parivaar ke logon kii hi thi
 At the same time, the Congress was also able to win only two seats belonging to the Gandhi family
 aisi sthiti main in sabhi dalon main bechaini he ki kaise bhi centre kii modi sarkaar ko haraaya ja sake
 But the opposition has no face in the face of the Prime Minister

 So far only 206 sezs have been commissioned and 362 hectares of land has been used
 isliye baaki 199 SEZ kii 4480 hectare jameen kisaanon ko waapas di jaae
 This organization alleges that the companies use this empty land to pledge banks for loans and hence a case should be registered against them
 court ne is maamle main centre or saat rajya maharashtra, pashchim bengal, tamilnadu, andhra pradesh, telugana, punjab se jawaab maanga he
 In the petition of the farmers it was said that 4842 hectares of land has been acquired in 405 places for SEZ in 15 states of the country
 isamen abhi tak sirf 206 SEZ shuru kiye gaye hai or 362 hectare jameen istemaal kii gai he

 kareeb ek ghante kii is hinsak bhidnt ke dauraan khet main mazdooree karne vaali kamala devi ne hansiye ko apana hathiyaar banaaya or aatmaraksha main tendue par tabadatod waar kiye
 While the leopard died after the incident, Kamala Devi's condition remains stable in the hospital after three fractures and around 100 stitches
 dilachasp baat yah bhi he ki is bhidnt ke baad gambhir rup se ghayal kamala devi kareeb ek kilometre tak paidal chalakar apane gaanv bhi pahunchi
 According to the information, Kamla Devi, a resident of Koti Bodna village of Rudraprayag, went to work on her farm on Sunday morning away from the village
 aise main dopaher kaa khaanaa banane ke liye jab vah khet se waapas gaanv laut rahi thi, tabhi raste main tendue ne un par hamalaa bol diya
 Kamala Devi had a sickle in her hand and she bravely made it her weapon
 gaanvvaalon kaa kahana he ki mahila se sangharsh ke baad tendua vahaan se chalaa gaya, jabaki baad main gaanv waalon ne use ek jagah par mara hua paaya
 Three fractures and more than 100 stitches of Devi's willpower can be gauged from the fact that despite being badly injured and constantly bleeding, she walked a kilometer to reach her village
 gaanvvaalon ne praathmik upachaar ke baad unhen agastyamuni aspataal main bhartee karavaaya
 He was later referred to Srinagar
 mahila kaa ilaaj kar rahe doctoron ne bataaya ki mahila ke sharir par 100 se zyada taanke lage hai

 Leopard attacks last a few minutes and at most 10 minutes
 tendue kii teji uske hamale ko ghaatak banaati he
 Rawat says, "this is probably the first case in the country where a woman has killed a leopard
" shaayad tendua boodha rahaa hoga yaa phir nausikhia
 The woman's wound may have caused the leopard to struggle for a longer time, as she felt that the woman could be hunted
 'rudraprayag van vibhaag ke sab diviginal asafar ajay kumaar ne bataaya ki unki team ne gaanv kaa daura kiya he or tendue ke mrit sharir ko agastyamuni laayaa gaya he
 The post-mortem of the leopard will be done when the cause of its death will be known

 sarkaar ne faisla kiya he ki vah sabsidi kaa paisa sidhe aam janata ke bank acount main jamaa kara de
 However, it is being touted by the government as an initiative to curb corruption and subsidy wastage
 is yojana se chauthai pariwaron ko laabh hone kii ummid he
 To implement this program in a time bound manner, Singh has made some structural arrangements
 iske tahat unhone apane adheen ek samiti ke gathan ke saath saath kuch anya samooh gathit kiye hai
 The idea is to implement this scheme on the basis of Aadhaar identification number
 bhrashtachar par lag sakegi roksarkaar har saal vibhinn prakaar kii sabsidi par 3,25,000 karod rupee kharch karti he
 The new scheme aims to curb corruption, rigging and wastage in subsidizing various items including diesel, LPG and other benefits such as pension and scholarships not reaching the needy
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ke ek bayaan ke anusaar, ‘bhrashtachar rokane tathaa jaruratmandon tab sabsidi kaa laabh pahunchane ke liye pradhanmantri ne sarkaar dwaara diya jane vaala laabh sidhaa labhaarthiyon ke bank khate main daalane kii yojana ko aage badhaane kaa nirnay kiya he
 'the statement said,' To implement this in a time bound manner, steps will be taken in this direction on a quick basis
 iske tahat jaruratmandon ko paisa sidhe unke khate main hastantarit kiya jayega

 pradhanmantri narendra modi 14 april ko chhattisgarh main saadhe chaar ghante bithaayenge
 In such a situation, the biggest challenge for the administration will be to mobilize the local tribals in the pm's meeting in 'naxal affected Jangla' area
 lekin prashasan kii is chunauti se zyada badi chunauti kaa saamana karenge sthaneey adivasee
 This is because the administration will put all its strength to mobilize the gathering, then the Naxalites will give their full strength to not gather the gathering
 prashasan or naksaliyon kii is nurakushti main pisenge to sthaneey adivasee
 How dangerous the visit to Chhattisgarh is can be gauged from the fact that 12 IAS and 24 IPS officers have already camped in Bastar for the Prime Minister's security
 unki suraksha ko lekar prashasan mustaid he
 On 12 April, forest minister Mahesh Gagda, two digs and several other officials spent several hours in Jangla inspecting the security system
 udhar laal galiyare main bhi halchal much gai he
 In Bijapur, anti-government and especially anti-prime Minister leaflets are being found
 jagah-jagah sabhaayen karke naksaliyon kii taraf se pradhanmantri kii sabha kaa bahishkaar karne kaa farmaan jari kiya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, it will be a tough challenge for the administration to mobilize the gathering of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 lekin kathin agni pariksha se guzrenge sthaneey adivasee
 If they go to the assembly as the administration believes, then the anger of the Naxalites will erupt on them and if they do not go, then the administration will have to face displeasure
 jagah-jagah chipke in parchon main pradhanmantri ke daure kaa virodh kiya gaya he
 Shlogans such as 'go Back, Go Back Modi' and 'neither Nationalism will run nor Modi' are written here
 sutron ke hawaale se yah bhi baat saamne aa rahi he ki naksaliyon ne piem kii sabha kaa bahishkaar karne kaa farmaan bhi jari kiya he
 By holding meetings, the villagers are being warned that if the Prime Minister goes to the meeting, the 'janatana Government' will punish them
 janatanaa sarkaar yaa adaalatein yani naksaliyon kii apni nijee sarkaar or adaalatein
 In fact, the Prime Minister has chosen to visit the Jangala area of bijapur to convey the message that he is capable of challenging the fear spread by the Naxalites
 laal galiyare ke khauf ko mili is chunauti se tilamilaae naksaliyon ne 11 april ko bijapur ke sarakeguda iidi lagaakar vaardaat ko anjaam dene kii naakaam koshish kii
 Not only this, on 9 April, a bus filled with soldiers was blown up by IED blast between Kuveenar and Tumnar in Bijapur
 isamen do jawan shahid ho gaye or chah ghayal hue
 For the safety of the Prime Minister, the administration has created an imposing security circle
 lekin sthaneey adivaasiyon kii suraksha khatre main pad gai he
 Here the administration will do its best to meet the target of gathering crowds in the Prime Minister's meeting, while the Naxalites will try not to allow the crowd to gather in the meeting
 aise main naksaliyon ke farmaan or prashasan kii apil ke bich sthaneey adivasee pisenge
 Now in such a situation, hatred of either of these two will be heavy for the tribals who have been grinding between the government and the Naxalites for years
 sukama ke ek sthaneey sutara kii maane to agar janata sabha main nahin ai to vahaan par tainaat sena ke javaanon kaa gussa jangla vaasiyon ko sahanaa padegaa or agar sabha main shaamil hue to janatanaa sarkaar chhodeygi nahin
 The Naxalites issue decrees in villages even today against taking advantage of any government scheme as soon as the Naxalite views the stream
 maujuuda samay main jahaan-jahaan sena tainaat he vahaan to phir bhi adivasee rashan lete hai
 But the situation remains the same in the areas falling within the forests
 jangla jaise ilaake main sarkari rashan lene se aaj bhi log darate hai
 In such a situation, the government man has also gone to Naxalites in the news of the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 is par bhi agar sthaneey logon ne sabha main shaamil hone kii koshish bhi kii to phir inhen harjaana bhugatna pad saktaa he
 The truth of the Janatana courts is that the tribals do not believe in the Indian government or state government institutions
 ve apni sarkaar chalaate hai
 Where they have their own courts
 insaaf kaa apana tarika hota he
 No long trial runs here
 faisla on da spot hota he
 In Samali Para, a village in Dantewada, about 60-year-old Sanaram said something about these courts
 'in adaalaton main jurm kii sajaa bahut khatarnaak hoti he
 Tongue biting, hand chopping, hanging the Surrey mango, strangling are common
 ye sajaaen in adaalaton main sunai nahin balki turant de di jaati hai
 'another person of the same village said,' If the suspect of the informer comes on any villager, then he is killed directly
 laash ko gaanv ke chauraahey main sadane ke liye daal diya jaataa he taaki gaanv waalon main khauf bana rahe
 'ever since the army was deployed, the entry of people from outside into the villages has stopped
 lekin andar ke gaanv abhi bhi inhen janatanaa sarkaron ke saay main jite hai
 Only the rule of those inside runs there
 sanaaraam ne kehete hai, kehane ko to janatanaa adaalaton ko ye log janata kii adaalat kehete hai
 But here the public only sees and listens as a mute spectator
 aarope bhi inke hote hai or sajaa bhi yahi tay karte hai
 Tying them to a tree in a petty charge is the least cruel punishment
 *** West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that she does not have a sense of vengeance and will continue to work for the good of the people even after criticisms
 mamata ne guuruuvaar ko ek samaaroh ke dauraan kaha ki jo log hamaari sarkaar kii aalochana kar rahe hai evam ham par keechad oochaal rahe hai unke saath meraa koi rishta nahin he

 iraq phir dehshat kii aag main jal rahaa he, kyonki duniya kii sabase khoonkhaar shay uski sarajameen par katlogarat se ek aisi ibaarat likh rahi he ki agar wo apane mansoobey main kaamyaab ho gai to samaj lijie ki duniya kaa nakshaa hi badal jayega
 It is just 400 km from the capital Baghdad and no one has the power to stop it at the moment
 aakhir kya he wo shay? koun he wo bhalaa? jisane ek mulk ke taur par iraq ke vajood par hi khatra paidaa kar diya he? darasal, duniya ke sabase amir aatankwaadi sanghathan islamic state of di iraq and da levent yani iesas kaa sirmaur abu bakar al bagdadi duusare lafjon main kahen to wo shaks he, jo ab iraq ke saath-saath tamaam north africa deshon ke liye khuf kaa vahshat kaa sabase bada naam ban chukaa he
 But now the question arises that why ISIS terrorists surround Iraq like this? After all, why are the ISIS khurdkukes moving ahead by cutting the Iraqi army like a carrot and radish? And how have the militants of this organization captured the three Iraqi cities of Phaluja, Tirakit and Mosul in the last few days? The answers to these questions are no less shocking
 darasal, iesas wo aatankwaadi sanghathan he, jo iraq samet kai mulkon main islam ke naam par apana raaj kaayam karnaa chahta he or koshish main usne ab iraq ke ek bade hisse par kabja kar liya he
 The situation is that due to this arrogance in this country, where 5 lakh people are living homeless in their own country as refugees, hundreds of people have lost their lives
 maujuuda reporton ke mutabik tamaam atyaadhunik hathiyaaron se las iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ne sabase pehle iraqi shahar faluja par kabja kiya or tab tirakit par, yahaan tak to phir bhi ganimat thi, lekin ab had ye he ki aatankwaadiyon ne baghdad ke baad iraq ke sabase bade shahar or baghdad se sirf 400 kilometre dur mosul ko bhi apane kabje main kar liya he
 Militants of this organization, now attacking with rocket launchers, mowing tanks and ramming bullets, are now spreading in Iraq
 isse iraq kii sadakon par mache maut ke tandav ke bich laashen to bich hi rahi hai, ek mulk ke taur par iraq lagaataar kamazor padane laga he
 It is Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, under whose leadership ISIS militants are trying to destroy Iraq
 yahi vajah he ki yues state department main is shaks kaa zindaa yaa murda pataa denevaale ko kul 10 million yues dollar ke inaam kaa elaan kiya he
 This amount is the second highest amount after the US prize, which is 25 million US dollars, placed on the head of Al Jawahri
 vaise to abu bakar al bagdadi ke koharaam ke kisse kaafii lambey hai, lekin is baar usne jis tarah aadhe iraq ko bandhak bana liya he, wo uskaa ab tak kaa sabase bada daanv he
 It is Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, led by ISIS militants not only captured the second major city of Iraq, Mosul, but in this context, the history of the world's biggest bank robbery by plundering the central bank of Mosul
 They have also named themselves
 16 may 2010 ko iesas ke mukhiya ke taur par duniya ke is sabase amir aatankwaadi sanghathan kii kaman sanbhalanevaala bagdadi pehle se alqaida ke commander osma bin laden kaa mureed rahaa he
 People remember how after the death of Laden he not only talked about revenge but also to form an Islamic country including all the Levant countries including Iraq, Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Turkey
 Had announced lekin uski ye manshaa ek rose iraq par is kadar kahar ban kar tuutegi, ye khud iraq ko bhi pataa nahin tha par iraq par kabja karne ke iraade se katle-aam machaa rahaa bagdadi apni torget main naa sirf bahut aage nikal chukaa he, balki iraq ke saath-saath puri duniya ke liye ek saradard sabit hone laga he
