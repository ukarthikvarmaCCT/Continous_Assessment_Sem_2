 The social equations in the Terai, the local problem in Kumaon and the faces in Garhwal have become important
 notebandi ko lekar janata main ab koi rosh, koi gussa nahin he, lekin rudki se lekar gadhwal ke srinagar or yamakeshwar tak vyapaaree vyapaar par asar padane ke baavjood kehete hai, ''nuksaan to hua he, lekin bijepi ke alaava kahaan jaaenge?'' ek sarkari adhikari kehete hai, ''van rank, van pension or sena pramukh ke taur par bipin ravat kii niyukti se logon main modi sarkaar se ummid jaagi he, isliye ve soobe main bhi bijepi kii sarkaar chaahate hai
 On the other hand, Chief Minister Harish Rawat could not retain the sympathy arising out of the dismissal issue in March
 bijepi bhi satark he, isliye vidhayak kharid-farokht vaale maamle main sibiai mukadmaa darj karne ke baavjood zyada teji nahin dikhaa rahi kyonki isse ravat phir sahanubhuti kaa laabh uthaa sakate hai
 According to sources, Rawat has specifically micromanaged the seats on which rebels are contesting from BJP
 jabaki bijepi ke zyaadaatar ummidavaar modi kii chhavi main hi apni jeet kaa pratibimb dekh rahe hai
 Rebels will spoil the equation BSP is also putting strength in some of the Terai seats in Uttarakhand

 This time Satpal Maharaj from BJP expressed his desire to contest the election, but in Chaubattakhal seat, former CM Ramesh Pokhriyal, who is considered close to Nishank, has gone to the polls to spoil the equation of Kavindra Ishtwal Maharaj
 ajay bhatta ke kshetra main bhi party ke baagi pramod nainvaal maidan main hai
 Apart from this, Dhan Singh Rawat and Trivendra Singh Rawat are also included in the race for the post of Chief Minister
 lekin sutron ke mutabik, bijepi ke chaaron purv siem satpal maharaj ko maidan main utaarne se khush nahin hai
 This time the battle of the mountain has become very interesting
 agar janata ne baagiyon ko pasand nahin kiya to nirdaleey kingmekar kii bhoomika main aa sakate hai
 But at present, the BJP, which has given an edge in front of Modi's image in the face of thorns, is very confident, while Harish Rawat has made a strategy to defeat BJP with the help of micromanagement

 saabhaar: newsflicks Before Mahatma Gandhi's auction of sunny grass and soil with a drop of blood, the Congress has expressed confidence that the government will be able to avoid a situation which hurts the sentiments of the people
 yah ghaas or mitti usee jagah kii he jahaan 1948 main rashtrapita kii hatya kii gayi thi
 Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said, 'be confident that the government will not allow any action that hurts the sentiments of the people of India as Mahatma Gandhi is respected not only in India but the whole world
 ’mahatma gandhi ke praputra tushaar gandhi ne is nilaamee par chintaa jataayi he
 UK auction house Mulak is planning this auction
 use ummid he ki is nilaamee se use 85 lakh rupaye tak mil sakate hai
 Spending money without thinking is the pride of the rich, but for a middle class family, running a house while meeting the needs for less money is a big challenge
 yahi vajah he ki kisi maheene agar kuch badi or mahangi kharidari kerani hoti he to ghar kaa bajet patari se utar jaataa he or puure maheene adjest karke chalanaa padataa he
 a big purchase is also necessary and you do not want it to have much impact on home expenses or if you have to regret it because of this stuff in future, then you must ask yourself these 5 questions before slowing your pocket
 1
 Is it in my budget? In fact, many times you come out of greed, hobby, or someone and make a big purchase due to which you have to sacrifice your small needs throughout the month
 isliye behatar he ki aisi kharidari se pehle acchhee planning karen agar saamaan bajet main ho tabhi khariden varanaa do-teen maheene main paise ikatthe karke saamaan khariden
 2
 kya is saamaan kii mujhe bhavishya main jarurat padegi?ek batameshaa dhyaan rakhenki jo saamaan aap kharidne ja rahe hai wo 'van time yuj' na ho
 If you are going to need it in future also, then decide to buy
 kyonki ek-do baar kii jarurat ke liye to aap kisi se mangakar bhi saamaan arange kar sakate he
 3
 kya ye cheez tikaoo hai?kisi bhi cheez kii gunvattta bahut mahatv rakhti he
 It is also an art to judge the quality of goods
 kuch log jyade paise dekar bhi acchhee quality ke saamaan nahin kharid pate or thag kaa shikaar ho jate hai
 In such a situation, take the information of that stuff with you or be wise with yourself
 4
 Is this a reasonable price? Many times it happens that the goods you buy are available in other shops or websites at a lower price
 aise main kuch bhi bada kharidne se pehle aapako achche se research jarur kar leni chahie
 Many times, discount offers and coupons on websites make a big difference in price
 5
 What is its return policy? Do not forget to take information about his return policy in haste to take the goods home
 itnaa hi nahin saamaan kii guarantee or varantee ke bare main bhi dhang se poochtacha kar leni chahie taaki agar samanvarantee periodke andar kharaab hota hai to free main uski servicing yaa exange kar saken
 There are many shopkeepers who do not return things, so take stock of all this while shopping

 Porn star-turned-bollywood actress Sunny Leone has appealed to the Hindu fundamentalist organization Bajrang Dal to put her energy and enthusiasm into creative work
 leone ne kaha, ‘wo (bajrang dal) kuch or kar sakate hai

 ) Famous director Mahesh Bhatt is celebrating his birthday today
 apni filmon ke saath hi saath unki jindagi se bhi kai vivaad jude rahe hai
 His mother was Muslim and father was Hindu
 unki maa ne hi unhen paal poskar bada kiya
 Perhaps this was the reason why he did not give much importance to marriage in his life
 mahesh bhatta jab college main the to wo lorien brit naam kii ek ladki ke pyaar main pad gaye the
 Laurien was later renamed Kiran Bhatt
 kiran, puja bhatta or rahul bhatta kii maa hai
 Being an experimental director, he also experimented with drugs and spirituality
 unhone vinod khanna ko osho se parichit karaayaa tha lekin unka khud hi osho se mohabhang ho gaya tha or ve krishnamurthi kii sharan main aa gaye the
 He was in an affair with actress Parveen Babi during his marriage, which caused discord in his marriage
 mahesh ke iske baad parveen se bhi rishte kharaab ho gaye
 It is also said that Parveen was very lonely in her last time and had a dangerous mental illness called Sitzophrenia
 kiran se rishton main kadavaahat ke bich mahesh kii jindagi main soni razdan ain lekin kiran or mahesh bhatta kaa talaak nahin hua tha
 Meanwhile, he married Soni
 is shaadi ke liye mahesh ne muslim dharm kabool kar liya tha
 Soni is the mother of Alia and Shaheen Bhatt
 mahesh bhatta kii life main sabase bada vivaad unki beti puja bhatta se judaa rahaa he
 He did a photoshoot while kissing daughter Pooja Bhatt for a magazine
 puja bhatta kahati hai ki unhone apane pita ko sharaab se jujhate dekha he lekin ve khush hai ki mahesh ab is aadat se mukt ho chuke hai

 ) People are fascinated by the grain of sugar, prices are touching the sky
 aakhir aisa kyon? sarkaar kahati he ki desh main chini kii killat he kyonki monsoon ne dhokhaa de diya
 But is it true? No, that's not true
 ye ek kahani he jiske jariye logon ko bargalaaya ja rahaa he
 The real truth about Chinese inflation is shocking
 abtak yahi kaha gaya he ki monsoon behatar nahin hua
 Sugarcane yield in the country has come down and hence sugar prices are continuously increasing
 lekin ye aadha sach he
 Rather, it is said that this is half a lie
 monsoon ne dhokhaa diya
 Sugarcane yield in the country has also decreased slightly
 This is an aspect of reality, but knowing its real reason will be astonishing
 aaj tak ne khoj nikaala he chini kii mahangaai ke asli gunahagaaron ko jiske kaaran chaay kii chuskee feekin ho gai he, mithaiyon kaa swaad kadava ho gaya he
 Their face will be exposed
 gujarat ke kandla bandargah ke godaamon main jahaan tak najar jaati he, chini kii boriyaan rakhi hui hai
 The entire warehouse is lined with sugar
 ye wo chini he jo videshon se mangai gai he auki jo sidhe bazaar main utaari ja sakati hai
 Or understand that it is the Chinese who can provide relief to the people suffering from back breaking inflation
 lekin kareeb 6 maheene se ye chini godaamon main padi hui he
 Not one such two godowns filled with sugar bags at Kandla port
 yahaan kai kilometre ke daayre main 100 se zyada godaam hai or jinamein sidhe istemaal kii ja sakane vaali safed chini kii boriyaan yaa ro sugar kaa stock jamaa he
 Out of the warehouses visited by Aaj Tak's team, in 8 out of 8 warehouses of white sugar were found and in about 20 to 22 warehouses, there was a quantity of raw sugar which can be refined in the mill and made useable
 sawaal uthta he ki desh main jab chini ke daam aasmaan par hai to godaamon main itani chini kyon rokkar rakhi gayi he? ye lakhon ton chini bazaar main utarkar logon ko raahat kyon nahin di ja rahi? sawaal ke jabaav main chupa he chini kii kadavaahat kaa asli khel
 People are worried about the inflation of sugar, but about 11 lakh tonnes of sugar has been lying in the godowns of Gujarat's Kandla port for the past several months
 jaankaar bataate hai ki ye chini bazaar main or keemten badhaakar munafa kamaane ke liye rokkar rakhi gai he
 You will be surprised to know that if this sugar was introduced in the markets at the time, neither the price of sugar would have caught fire like this nor the pockets of the common people of the country would have been cut like this

 24-year-old Mehdi Masroor Biswas, who is running the Twitter handle Shami Witness, has been arrested for promoting the terrorist organization Islamic State from Bangalore
 lekin ye puraa maamla ab kai sawaal uthaa rahaa he or inamen sabase bada sawaal internet ke jariye naujavaanon ko bhadakaane, prabhavit karne or aies jaise aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke liye kaam karne kaa he
 Before Biswas, influenced by IS through the Internet, Arif Majid of Kalyan and four more youth from there reached Iraq for Jihad
 ab enie ye pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi he ki aakhir majid ke waapas aane kaa makasad kya he
 But the way opened through the Internet is not only harassing the security agencies but also the parents
 kya ye kisi bhi tarah sambhav he ki internet ko regaullett kiya ja sake
 Such content that fills the minds of the youth can be filtered out
 abhi kuch maheene pehle supreme court main internet par pornography ko bain karne ke liye ek janhit yachika daayar hui thi, lekin internet ko regaullett karne main sarkaar ne mushkil jataai thi
 Child porn is banned in many countries, but even then these countries have completely failed to filter it too
 aise main internet ke zarie aatank kaa prachaar prasar rokane main kitni safalataa mil paaegi yaa yah bhi ki ye kitna vyavaharik kadam hoga
 Meanwhile, ten leading imams of Britain have come together to stop the online propaganda of terrorist organizations
 unki maang he ki internet kii safai hone chahie
 But he has accused some prominent internet companies of not taking enough steps to stop the spread of terrorist organizations - every type of extremist content is available on the net at one click
 or ab in imaamon ne imams aanaline naam se ek website banaai he, jis par koi bhi aam muslim naagarik aapattijanak contate report kar saktaa he
 Since 2001, the NSA spied civilians in the US, who came before the people in 2005 and caused a great uproar
 internet companiyaan ke zarie raashtra virdohi gatividhiyon par roak lagane main abhi bhi kai samasyaayein hai or companiyaan jaankaree ko lekar bahut madadgaar nahin he, or naa adhiktar log apni nijee zindagi kii jasusi chaah sakate hai
 Can security agencies in India expect help from companies? Probably very few

 Why is there a lunar eclipse? The simple answer to this is that the arrival of the moon in the earth's shadow
 us sthiti main surya ek taraf, chandramaa duusari taraf or prithvi bich main hoti he
 a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon comes out of the Earth's shadow
 chandragrahan poornima ke din hi padataa hechandragrahan poornima ke din padataa he lekin har poornima ko chandra grahan nahin padataa he
 The reason for this is that the Moon's orbit is bent on the Earth's orbit
 yah jhukaav takreeban 5 degree he isliye har baar chandramaa prithvi kii chaaya main pravesh nahin karata
 It escapes from the top or bottom
 yahi baat suryagrahan ke liye bhi sach he
 Solar eclipses are always on the new moon day because the size of the moon is about 4 times less than the size of the earth
 isaki chaaya prithvi par choti aakaar kii padati he isiilie purnataa kii sthiti main surya grahan prithvi ke ek chote se hisse se hi dekha ja saktaa he
 But in the event of a lunar eclipse, the Earth's shadow is much larger than that of the Moon
 lihaaja isse guzarane main chandramaa ko zyada vakt lagata he

 You might have seen people giving their servants a happy hand, but an owner would be so happy with the help of his servant to give him a fortune of six hundred crores, that he would neither have seen nor heard of
 rajkot main ek naukar ko apane maalik se bakhshish main chah sau karod kii aisi vasiyat mili ki khud maalik ke rishtedaaron ne hi naukar ko agava tak kar liya
 One day such a fate of this servant changed his position that on seeing this, this man became the owner of six hundred crores
 kisi filmi kahani se milte takadir ke is karishme par ab khud is shaks ke saath-saath inhen jaananevaala har koi hairaan he, lekin rajkot ke is shaks ne ye kamaal naa to koi lottery jitkar kiya or naa hi kisi rahasyamayi khajaane par haath markar
 Rather, it has become possible due to a will, in front of which this person living in Mufalisi till yesterday is being considered among the richest people of the area today

 Call it the reward of 40 years of loyalty or the result of the money received from his relatives, when Gajraj Singh Jadeja, a zamindar of Rajkot, wrote this will to Vinubhai, it was not even known to the person in whose name it was written
 Was going jameendaar kii maut ke teen maheene baad jaise hi ye raaj saamne aayaa daulat ke saath-saath naukar kii shamat bhi aa gai
 According to this will, along with this luxurious mansion of Gajraj Singh, the owner of all the land, property, diamonds and gems and money was none other than the same Vinubhai who lived with him for the last 40 years and served him every moment
 Kept doing ek naukar kii vafadari or maalik ke dariyaadilii kii is anokhi kahani main tab ek bada twist aa gaya, jab chand roj pehle gajraj singh ke rishtedaaron ne achaanak unki is haveli par dhaava bol diya
 In fact, after Gajraj Singh left, only Vinubhai was staying with his family in this mansion
 
 
 lekin isi bich gajraj singh ke bhattije or duusare rishtedaaron ko jab apane chachaa ke vasiyat kii khabar mili, to unhone apana aapa kho diya or vinubhai ko sab sikhaa kar chah sau karod kii daulat hadapney ke liye is haveli par dhaava bol diya
 Vinubhai and his family believed that his master's nephews later not only assaulted him but also signed several documents and kept him hostage for hours
 jab police ko is baat kii khabar mili or vardiwaalon ne is haveli main dabish di, tab jaakar vinubhai or unke gharavaalon ko bandhak rahane se aazaadee mil pai
 In 37 years from the business of farming and property, Gajraj Singh, who built a property worth just a few thousand rupees for six hundred crores, did not get married, but Vinubhai took care of him as much as he could, he became a servant of this servant
 Left
 duusari ore, apane rishtedaaron or khaskar bhatijon ke saath gajraj singh ke rishte koi bahut achche nahin rahe
 So, in 1993, when he had an attack on paralysis, Gajraj Singh decided to put this thing in his mind on paper and then called his lawyers one day and did the work, which is usually about someone It is not possible to think for
 log bataate hai ki kaamkaaj ke silsile main gajraj singh saalon pehle jab-jab rajkot aate the, to ek haveli main tehra karte the or un dinon isi haveli main maasoom vinu gajraj singh kii seva kiya karata tha or bas, unheen dinon se vinu ne gajraj singh kaa dil kuch aisa jeeta ki unhone use apane saath rakh liya
 After this, Gajraj Singh got her married and raised her children's education and education expenses, and with the money of Gajraj Singh, three of Vinubhai's children went from India to England and now Vinubhai after Gajraj Singh left and His entire family has become his real heir

 apane sanyas ke ek din baad ravivaar ko sachin tendulkar ne dil kholkar duniya ke saamne rakh diya
 Sachin said that his international career of 24 years and one day has been like a golden journey and he has no complaints about it
 sachin ne kaha ki beshak ab unka tan bhartiya team ke saath nahin lekin man or prarthanaaon ke saath vah hameshaa apan team ke saath jude rahenge
 In a press conference held at Mumbai's five-star Hotel Trident, Sachin said that he will no longer represent India but he will always be with Team India
 sachin bole, "sharir se bhale hi main desh ke nahin khelun lekin man se main hameshaa apni team ke saath hum or har samay uski jeet ke liye prarthana karata rahoonga
 i will always think that the Indian team is at the top
 " Sachin said that he too sometimes gets surprised about how he continued to play for the country for 24 years, but one thing gives him the answer that he has immense passion and doing something for this game
 It was encouraging to show
 bakaul sachin, "mere liye 24 saal or ek din kaa safar svarnim rahaa he
 i saw many ups and downs in my career
 mujhe kisi se koi shikaayat nahin
 i am happy that i decided to retire at the right time
 " Sachin admitted that after 24 years of cricket, the body was starting to leave him and he decided to retire on the basis of the signal given by him
 pakistan ke khilaaf 15 navambar, 1989 ko antarrashtriya kariyar kaa aagaaj karne vaale sachin ne 24 saal or ek din ke baad shanivaar ko sanyas liya
 Sachin started cricket at the age of 11
 is lihaaj se vah apane jivan ke 40 saal main se 30 saal khelte rahe
 Sachin said, "my body could not bear the pressure
 usne mujhe sanket kar diya tha
 i was not able to do the workouts as before
 mujhe training seshan ke dauraan thodaa tivi dekhne kaa man hota tha
 It was kind of a sign for me
 is baat ne sawaal khadaa kar diya tha ki man to cricket main abhi bhi rama he lekin sharir saath nahin de rahaa he
 What should we do in such a situation? tab maine sanyas kii ghoshnaa kii
 " vishwa ke mahanatam ballebaajon main se ek sachin kaha ki shanivaar kaa din unke liye bhaawanaaon main bahane kaa din tha
 According to Sachin, he got carried away on many occasions and the biggest reason for this was that he would not be able to play for India at the international level
 sachin ne kaha ki vah kai maukon par bhaavnaatmak hue or kuch maukon par unki aankh bhi bhar ai
 The only reason behind this was that Saturday was the last day of his international career
 sachin ne kaha, "mere saathiyon ne jab mujhe guard of honor diya, tab main bhaavnaatmak hua
 i got emotional when Kohli and Dhoni picked me up while walking around the ground
 iske baad pich se baat karte hue main bhaavnaatmak hua
 This was the precious moment of my life
 aise main bhala bhavanaaen haaavee kaise nahin hotin
 " vankhede stadium main apane 200wein or antim test ke baad pich ko jhukkar salaam karne se jude sawaal par sachin ne kaha ki darasal vah cricket ko un sabhi chizon ke liye dhanyavad dena chaahate the, jo cricket ne unako diya he
 Sachin also admitted that his eyes were filled when he went to bat for the last time, but he did not let anyone realize that this could have exposed his weakness
 sachin ne kaha ki cricket unke liye oxygen rahaa he
 Sachin said, "cricket has been my life
 maine isse pehle bhi kai baar kaha he ki yah mere liye oxygen kaa kaam karata he or aaj bhi yahi kah rahaa hum
 i have played cricket for 30 years out of 40 years of my life and while i have retired, i cannot believe that i will not be able to play for the country
 " a question was also asked to Sachin that what kind of player would he like to see Arjun? In response, Sachin only said that leave Arjun alone and let him enjoy his game
 sachin ne kaha ki unke mata-pita ne kabhi un par kisi prakaar kaa dabaav nahin daalaa or na hi us samay media ne un par kisi tarah kaa dabaav unke pita or lekhak ramesh tendulkar par daalaa tha

 However, Tulan was done only to blur the bokeh effect
 bekground bler karne kaa feechar delaar kaa ek feechar he jo ab smartphone main bhi trend main he
 Talking about background blur and clicking pictures, this phone is excellent for this
 tasviren acchhee aati hai or diteling bhi thik thaak he
 But it is not like the company claimed that it blurs the best background than the iphone 7 Plus
 hamane Mi A1 or iphone 7 Plus se depth effect vaali tasviren lee jisamen iphone 7 Plus behatar sabit hua he
 The camera of the Mi A1 affects the segment accordingly

 Every batsman in the world wants to get close to the records of Indian master blaster Sachin Tendulkar, but this star batsman also has a record in the name, around which hardly a cricketer would want to reach
 yah record he, 90 ran bana lene ke baad shatak puraa karne se pehle pavilion laut jane kaa record, jo 'nervas nintiz' kehalaata he
 Sachin Tendulkar topped the list of 'nervous Nights' most frequently in Test and one-day international cricket
 test maichon main vah 10 baar, ek-divasiy antarrashtriya maichon main 18 baar (ek baar naabad sahit) nervas nintiz kaa shikaar bane
 So, in international cricket, Sachin Tendulkar, who made a world record for scoring a century in centuries, had 28 occasions in his career when he could not achieve it despite coming close to a century
 vaise bhi sachin tendulkar ke is record tak shaayad hi koi ballebaaj pahunch paae, kyonki unke baad 'nervas nintiz' kaa shikaar hone waalon kii list main bharat ke hi rahul dravid (14 baar) duusare number par kabiz hai, or vah pehle hi antarrashtriya cricket ko alavida kah chuke hai
 Among the players who are still playing in the list, South Africa's Jack Kallis was a victim of 'nervous Ninties' 13 times
 jahaan tak sirf test maichon ke record kaa sawaal he, sachin tendulkar ke alaava rahul dravid or australia ke steve wa bhi 10-10 baar 90 or 99 ran ke bich pavilion laute
 Sachin Tendulkar has missed a century 18 times after scoring 90 runs in an innings of one-day international cricket, and is followed by Graeme Flower, Nathan Astle and Arvind desilva, who are denied nine centuries on nine occasions
 Left
 in 18 pariyon main ek mauka aisa tha, jab sachin tendulkar 96 ran banaakar naabad laute the
 Sachin Tendulkar became the victim of 'nervous Nights' most often in the year 2007
 is saal vah chah baar van-de international cricket main or ek baar test match main 90 se 99 ke bich out hue
 In one-day internationals, he returned to the pavilion by scoring 99 thrice that year, which is a different record
 iske alaava sachin tendulkar varsh 2000 main chaar baar, varsh 1997, 2003, 2005 or 2011 main do-do baar kuch ranon se shatak banane se chuke
 Under the captaincy of former Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin, he has a good record of turning his innings into a century
 mohammad ajaharuddin ke captain rahete hue vah keval teen baar 'nervas nintiz' kaa shikaar bane, jabaki saurav ganguli or rahul dravid kii captaini main unke aise score kii sankhya saat-saat rahi, or mahendra singh dhoni kii aguwai vaale maichon main vah chah 'nervas nintiz' main out hue
 Even when Sachin Tendulkar was the captain himself, he could not complete a century despite reaching beyond 90 runs on four occasions
 iske alaava tendulkar ko record 30 baar 80 se lekar 89 ran ke bich pavilion lautnaa padaa he
 They are followed by Jack Kallis (26 times), Brian Lara (22 times), Sourav Ganguly (21 times) and Rahul Dravid (20 times)
 test maichon main vah 12 baar 80 or 89 ran ke bich pavilion laute hai

 com / zgbavh0zdr — ANI (@ANI) December 5, 2019 In Maharashtra, Shiv Sena has formed a government in alliance with Congress and NCP
 teenon dalon ne sena pramukh uddhav thakare ko mukhyamantri banaae jane par sahmati di jiske baad unka shapath grahan hua
 At present, 2-2 mlas have taken oath from all the three parties
 bahut jald cabinet vistaar hone kii sambhaavna he
 According to sources, the final decision has been taken on the cabinet post, only the announcement remains
 haal ke dinon main bijepi or shivasena main talkhi bad gai he
 Two and a half years on the issue of the Chief Minister being created, the two parties distanced themselves from each other
 shivasena kaa aarope he ki bijepi ne chunaav se pehle shivasena ko dhai saal ke liye mukhyamantri pad dene kii baat kahi thi lekin nattejey aane ke baad vah palat gai
 On the other hand, BJP says that he never made such a promise to Shiv Sena
 ant main donon partiyon main isi mudde par takaraar bad gai or shivasena ne apni puraani sahyogi party bijepi se alag hokar congress or ensipi ke saath sarkaar bana lee
 Responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's verbal attack, NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday, citing rites given by his mother, said he would not launch a personal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even if Modi had done so
 maharashtra ke wardha main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ke chunaav prachaar kii shuruyaat karte hue piem modi ne somvaar ko daawa kiya ki ensipi pramukh ne pratikul sthiti dekhte hue loksabhaa chunaavon se apana naam waapas le liya he
 Targeting Sharad Pawar, the Prime Minister had said that Pawar's grip on the party was loosening and the NCP had become weak due to the family feud that had arisen due to his nephew
 pradhanmantri ne beete din umr abdulla kii 'do pradhanmantri' vaali tippanee ke baad bhi sharad pavaar se is par rukh saaf karne kii apil kii thi
 modincp chief Sharad Pawar is doing personal attacks in response to Prime Minister Modi's attack on Tuesday, saying, 'modi is carrying out personal attacks wherever he is going
 lekin main aisa nahin karuunga kyonki main apni maa dwaara die gaye sanskaron se prabhavit hum
 Personal criticism does not fit in our culture
 ' saath hi unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ko ensipi main paariwarik kalah ke bare main chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Following the pm's attack, NCP national spokesperson Nawab Malik claimed that the BJP and Shiv Sena would not get a single seat in the first phase election in Vidarbha and that would be because their campaign rallies in the eastern Maharashtra region are getting a poor response
 apane pita par kiye siyaasi hamalon par ensipi saansad supriya sule ne kaha, 'pradhanmantri kaa aisa kahana apratyaashit he
 It is very unfortunate that the person whose party does not respect the elders has said so
 unase mul muddon or vikaas par bolne kii ummid thi
 In an election rally in Wardha, Vidarbha, PM Modi targeted Sharad Pawar, saying that the NCP was surrounded by family feuds and Pawar's hold on the Maratha Kshatrapas' party was loosening
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha ki pavaar ne isliye chunaav nahin ladane kaa faisla kiya kyonki unhen ahsaas he ki halaat unke paksh main nahin he
 Our worker will stand with the flag at every booth in the country! Our workers should reach home! It is necessary to meet the 'pradhan ji' of Sumerpur before the political preparations for setting water on fire
 pradhan ji sikhaate hai ki jab koi samaaj apane pragati ke lakshya badalata he to use apni chintaaon ke aayam badal lene chahie anyathaa begaangi achche-khaase samaajon kaa tiya paancha kar detii he
 Pradhan ji's convoy is a little smaller than the Prime Minister
 unka paariwarik pratap panchayat pramukhon se lekar panna pramukhon tak failaa he
 From MGNREGA to Ujjwala, the figures of every scheme drink their water from the antechamber
 bhai, bhattije, naati, bahuen, sab kahin na kahin kisi na kisi sarkaar kaa hissaa hai
 His house becomes like an all-party meeting on festivals and shaving
 pradhan ji party kaa vistaar hai
 He is the mascot of the Government's Public Relations Mission
 ve sarkaar kii sarkaar hai
 Pradhan ji is the 'maximum Government'
 pradhan ji, darasal, ‘vada pradhan’ kii chaar saalaa ummiido kaa sajiv smarak hai
 In May, in 2014, enthusiastic Narendra Modi made a promise that no government before him had done so well
 modi ne kaha tha ki vah sarkaar choti karenge yani minimum government
 His promise was worth extinguishing, because it also contained remedies for the troubles which did not go away with the dose of reforms after 1991
 sarkaar ko sikodkar pradhanmantri modi hajaar tarah kii barbaadi, saikadon tareeke ke bhrashtachar or asankhya napak netaa-afasar gathjodon ko khatm karne ja rahe the
 He went on to write Murcia of political corruption
 lekin phir vakt ne girggit hona kabool kiya or modi sarkaar pichhali kisi sarkaar se zyada scimen pachaakar badi hoti gai
 Long-term governments sit on development, so now the promotion of schemes and 'pradhan ji' are the only support to make development felt
 pradhanmantri narendra modi sarkaar ko fitness kaa mantra de pate, isse pehle bhaajapa ne duniya kii sabase badi party banane kaa bidaa uthaa liya or phir vahi hua jo pichley 60 saal se hota aayaa tha
 To make the party bigger, it was necessary to enlarge the government
 china kii communist party kitne saare kaarobaaron main dakhal rakhti he
 This gruesome capitalism of communists (crony capitalism) has now ended the difference between party leaders and businessmen
 pataa nahin, ham bhartiya kab is virus ke shikaar hue ki zyada se zyada logon ko raajnneeti main aana chahie
 But political parties benefited from this disease
 unka sansar bada hota chalaa gaya
 However, hundreds of hardworking and meritorious people, from village to cities, were not going to lose their most productive years (25 to 60) for the handful of 'chair sticks' leaders, especially when they know that the topmost in politics Flocks of people flock to every ladder
 unhen apane shram kaa vaazib mulya yani apane liye thodi-si sarkaar chahie
 Hence the organizational expansion of political parties becomes a sibling of Thulthuli governments
 bhartiya raajnneeti ek vibhats bijness model par aadhaarit he, pradhan ji jiske brands ambesder hai
 For them, politics is their business, or politics is why it is business
 jo dal satta main hote hai, ve sanghathan badhaane ke liye sarkaar badhaate hai or phir satta main bane rahane ko liye sanghathan va sarkaar ko badhaate rahanaa hota he
 The more people in politics, the bigger the governments will become and corruption will be equally important
 bhaajapa ko puure desh main failaate hue pradhanmantri modi choti sarkaar kaa adarsh sambhaal nahin sakate the, isliye unki sarkaar badi hoti gai
 Today, political corruption is dominating the lower and middle pillars more than ever
 chaar saal main sabase badi party sabase beshumaar sarkaar main tabdeel ho gai he
 • The rush of subsidies and schemes has increased more than ever
 kaaryakartaaon kii kamai ke liye yah jaruri he
 • Political donations did not become transparent

 Today i want to request something special from you all
 is vaarta main kuch gambhir vishay, kuch mahatvapurn nirnay aap se saajha karuunga
 You will note that when you entrusted us with responsibility in May 2014, then in the context of BRICS in the world economy, there was a general discussion that the letter "I" in BRICS, which is associated with India, people used to say in BRICS " i have ", he is rolling
 lagaataar 2 saal kedeshvyapee akalke baavjood bhi, pichley dhai varshon main sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke sahyog se aaj bharat ne global iconmi main ek “brit spot” arthath chamakta sitara ke rup main apni upastithi darj karai he
 It is not that we are making this claim, but rather this voice is resonating with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank
 bahanon bhaaiyon,vikaas kii is daud main hamaara mul mantra rahaa he “sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas”
 This government is dedicated to the poor and will remain devoted
 garibi ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kaa mukhya shastr rahaa he – garibon kaa desh kii arthvyavastha evam sampannataa main sakriyabhagidaari yani garibon kaa shashaktikaran, garibon kaa empowerment

 On the one hand, we are at the forefront of the fast-growing countries in the world
 duusari taraf bhrashtachar kii global ranking main do saal pehle bharat kareeb-kareeb sauven number par tha
 Despite taking a lot of steps, we have been able to reach number six
 yah is baat ko darshata he ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kaa jaal kitne vyapak rup se desh main bicha he
 Some sections of people have spread the disease of corruption due to their selfishness
 garibon ke haq ko nazarandaz kar ye khud falte-phoolate rahe hai
 Some people took full advantage of this by misusing the position
 duusari taraf, imaanadaar logon ne iske khilaaf ladaai bhi ladi he
 Crores of citizens of the country have shown honesty by living
 ham praayah yah sunate hai kii garib auto dryver apni gadee main chhot gai sone ke aabhushan vaale bag ko uske asli maalik ko kaise dhund kar lautaata he, kai baar ham sunate hai koi taxi dryver yatriyon kaa koi saamaan agar chhot jaataa he, mobile phone rah jaataa he to apane kharche se unako dhughane jaataa he, or pahunchaa detaa he, are sabji bechney vaala bhi, saamaanya duukaan vaala bhi agar graahak se galati se zyada paise le liye to to usko bulaakar lautaa detaa he
 Dear countrymen, this is proof that the commonest citizen of India is honest, but dear countrymen, there have been moments in the history of development of every country when the need for a powerful and decisive step was felt
 is desh ne yah varshon se mahasoos kiya he ki bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad - aise nasoor hai jo desh ko vikaas kii daud main peeche dhakelti hai
 Makes the country and society hollow inside itself
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon,aatankwaad kii bhayaanakta ko koun nahin jaanata he? kitne nirdosh logon ko ke maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa he
 But have you thought that from where the money is provided to these terrorists? Our enemies across the border run their business in India through fake notes, through fake notes and this has been going on for years

 Brothers and sisters, the web of terrorism and counterfeit notes on one side is destroying the country
 duusari ore bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kii chunauti desh ke saamne bani hui he
 We started the fight against corruption and black money immediately after assuming the task, taking several effective steps, such as: SIT was constituted under the chairmanship of a former Supreme Court judge to investigate black money

 Excess circulation of cash in the country has a direct relation with corruption

 The poor have to bear the brunt of this
 is kaa sidhaa prabhaav garib or madhyam varg kii kharidne kii shakti par padataa he
 You will have your own experience, when buying a house or land, you will take some money from you in check and most of the money will be sought in cash
 eemaandaar vyakti ke liye kuch bhi khareednaa, ek madhyam varg ke vyakti ke liye ghar khareednaa ho, uske paas kala dhan nahin he to musiibat ho jaati he
 Due to this business of cash, there is a lot of artificial increase, artificial increase in the value of many services and goods like house, land, higher education and medicine
 bhrashtachar se jamaa kiya gaya dhan ho yaa kaala dhan ho, ye donon benami hawala kaarobaar ko bal dete hai
 And we know that hawala is also used by the terrorists in the purchase of arms
 chunaavon main kaale dhan ke prabhaav kii charchaa to varshon se ho rahi he

 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals Mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate fifty thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he kii desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days
 meraa puraa vishwaas he kii desh kaa prayek naagarik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shuchita ke is mahayajna main mil kar khadaa hoga
 My dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali, now in this celebration of honesty, in this festival of authenticity, you go upstairs
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, samjik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, when i am putting these things before you, at the same time different departments of the government are also getting information, be it bank, post office, railway, hospital, their officials also from this subject
 No information has been found before
 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time
 is vyavastha main kuch samay to jayega
 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will be closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in the bank and post office will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he
 i request the Janata Janardan so much that all citizens should be patient and cooperate with all banks and post office officers, this is my request and request
 bahanon or bhaaiyon,samay samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakh kar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 In the end, my dear countrymen, i want to reiterate that there are moments in the history of a country when every person feels that he too has to be a part of that moment
 use bhi raashtra hit main, raashtra nirmaan main apana yogadan dena he
 But such moments only come to be counted in everyone's life
 aaj samay hamen phir se ek avasar de rahaa he
 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency
 bahanon or bhaaiyon aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite
 samay samay par hamane dekha he kii bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hoon behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you to come as you cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we should make it a success by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaiye sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, pure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jis se kii desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for the support of all of you
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali peedheeyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you

 a fire broke out at the North Reef Hotel in Andaman and Nicobar around 3 am on Tuesday
 is haadase main ek bachche kii maut ho gai
 While seven other people were injured
 aag lagane par puure hotel main dhuaan fail gaya jiske baad maukey par damakal kii gadiyon ko bulaayaa gaya
 After the accident, the hotel was evacuated and people were taken to a safe place
 aag aadhi raat ke samay lagi isliye zyaadaatar log turant apane kamaron se baahar nikalakar bhaage
 The injured have been admitted to the hospital where they are being treated
 zyaadaatar log dhune kii vajah se biimaar hai

 'jo man main aae chhaapie yaa naa chhaapie mujhe publicity kii koi zarurat nahin he agar aapke man main aae to meraa negative publicity din raat karte rahiye,' yah kahana he bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa
 Nitish took out his anger on the media on Friday at an event of Janata Dal United
 nitish is baat se media se naaraaz hai ki jo bhi unke kilaaf bolta hai use koob jagah milti hai bhale hi nitish kumaar ke shabdon main us vyakti ko raajnneeti kaa 'k kha ga' aata ho yaa nahin
 However, Nitish said that he has no worries about this because he knows that people do their propaganda by speaking out loud
 is raajnneetik kaarykram main manch se nitish ne kaha ki sab ke nishane par ham hi rahenge lekin media unako zyaada jagah detii hai
 But they do not care about all this because the people of Bihar are happy and vote for our work
 nitish ke talkh se saafe he ki vah har mudde par apni sarkaar ke khinchaai se zyaada apane virodhiyon ko media main milane vaale spes se kush nahin hai
 But the truth is that Nitish himself also does not want to have more connection with the media than the government press release, due to which the relationship has become uneven now
 vahiin unki badi maansik pareshaani yah bhi hai ki jo unke agal bagal ke rajya ke bhaajapa ke mukhyamantri hai wo apane vigyaapan ke aadhaar par kshetreey charchaa main chhaae rahete hai

 The film also stars Chakravarthy in the lead role
 film kaa ek gaanaa kis me avrivair apane kaamuk andaaj ko lekar charchaa bator rahaa he
 Ice Cream 2's song Kiss Me Everywhere fadanvis kaa siem pad or ajit pavaar kaa dipti siem pad se istifabhole- sinchai ghotaalaa kii jaanch par raajnneetik uthalputhal kaa asar nahin hogamaharashtra main mangalvaar ko bada siyaasi ulatpher dekhne ko mila
 Devendra Fadnavis resigned as Chief Minister of the state and Ajit Pawar as Deputy Chief Minister
 ajit pavaar ke istife ke baad fadanvis media ke saamne aae or mukhyamantri pad se apane istife kaa elaan kiya
 Meanwhile, Aaj Tak correspondent Sahil Joshi questioned Fadnavis that you had raised the irrigation scam case against Ajit Pawar in a big way
 saath hi kaha tha ki ajit pavaar ko jail main chakki pisni padegi lekin shanivaar ko aapane ajit pavaar ke saath milakar soobe main sarkaar bana lee, to aapane ajit pavaar ko clin de di he?is par fadwis ne kaha ki maharashtra main jab paanch saal tak hamaari sarkaar rahi, to hamane sinchai ghotaalaa maamle main jaanch kii
 Now the case is being investigated under the supervision of the court
 is maamle par siyaasi uthalputhal kaa koi prabhaav nahin padegaa
 He said that as far as forming the government with Ajit Pawar is concerned, he is the leader of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and when we do not have a clear majority, we have to form a government with the leader of his party
 ajit pavaar kii jagah koi or ensipi kaa netaa hota, to ham uske saath milakar sarkaar banaate
 When Fadnavis was asked whether the BJP had made a mistake in forming a government in Maharashtra with Ajit Pawar, he tried to avoid the question, whether it was a mistake to form a government with Ajit Pawar or not, it will be seen later
 abhi ham ensipi ke saath sarkaar nahin bana sakate hai or main apane mukhyamantri pad se istipha de rahaa hum
 Let us tell you that Ajith Pawar's name was revealed in the Rs 70,000 crore irrigation scam in Kimhara
 jab yah ghotaalaa saamne aayaa tha, us samay ajit pavaar congress-ensipi gathbandhan sarkaar main sinchai vibhaag sambhaal rahe the
 The matter was vigorously raised by the Bharatiya Janata Party, Shiv Sena, Aam Aadmi Party and other opposition parties while in opposition

 Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has lashed out at Congress President Rahul Gandhi for fielding Randeep Singh Surjewala in the Jind by-election
 unhone kaha ki kisi vidhayak ko vidhansabha upachunaav main utaarne kaa kaam koi pappu hi kar saktaa he
 Khattar, who reached Jind to thank the workers for the victory of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate Krishna Middha in the by-election, made this remark
 upachunaav main party ko mili jeet par khatter ne kaha, 'vah kaaryakartaaon ke saamne natmastak hai or unheen kii mehnat se yah sab ho paaya he
 There was enthusiasm among the party workers in Jind, the same is in the entire state
 ' mukhyamantri ne rahul gandhi kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha, 'unhone yah kya kar diya
 Being an MLA, Surjewala proved that he can do the same by fighting a by-election in Jind and no other
 ' samachar agency pitiai-bhashaa ke anusaar khatter ne kaha ki jis raat 11 bajkar 50 minute par surajevaala ko congress ne jind upachunaav ke liye tikat diya tha, usee dauraan vah tivi dekh rahe the or tabhi unka maathaa thanak gaya tha ki aisa koi or nahin balki koi pappu hi kar saktaa he
 Khattar said, 'for the first time in the history of the country, the Congress party gave the ticket to the MLA to become the MLA
 main poochta hum ki kaithal or jind main kya fark he
 Did thorns grow on Kaithal's MLA seat
 jind main mili upachunaav kii jeet ke baad ve kai duusare pradeshon main gaye
 People have congratulated him not for bjp's victory but for Surjewala's defeat
 'mukhyamantri ne kaha ki haryana pradesh kii dhai karod janata hi meraa parivaar he, is parivaar ke vikaas main koi kor kasar baaki nahin rakhaa jayega
 The Chief Minister said that to provide better medical facilities to the people and to meet the shortage of doctors in hospitals, one medical college will be established in every district
 philhal, 750 nae doctor har saal pradesh ko mil rahe hai or aagaamee kuch varshon main is sankhya ko badhaakar do hajaar karne kaa lakshya tay kiya gaya he

 After being confronted by the media at one o'clock in the afternoon, the two leaders came out of the Lohia auditorium and took the blessings of sp's mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav
 in ke aane ke baad kaaryakartaaon se ghire mulaayam ne mike thama or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke saath sapa ke gathbandhan par hi sawaal uthaa die
 He said, "why gave Mayawati half the seat? The party was very strong, its own people are weakening it
 ham apane dam par party ko sheersh par laae the
 Akhilesh formed an alliance and did not ask us
 '' sansad ke bajet satr main 16 farvari ko narendra modi ko dobaaraa pradhanmantri banane kii baat kehane vaale mulaayam singh yadav ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan par sawaal khadeykar yah sanket diya ki unki party ke bheetar sab thik nahin chal rahaa he
 An hour after Mulayam's meeting, when the seat-sharing (see graphics) between the SP and BSP came to an end, the resentment of the senior leaders inside the party gradually became vocal
 gathbandhan main sapa 37 siton par or basapa 38 siton par chunaav ladegi
 Two seats have been left for Rae Bareli and Amethi, Congress and three seats for Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD)
 banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay main professor ajit kumaar kehete hai, ''sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke saamne sabase badi chunauti un netaaon ko saath rakhane kii he jo pichley paanch varshon se loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe the or ab unki seat duusari party ke paas chali gai he
 In such a situation, it is a difficult challenge for both SP and BSP parties to shift their vote bank to each other
 '' upi kii 80 loksabhaa siton ke bantwaare ke baad basapa kii rashtriya adhyaksh mayawati ne uttarakhand main loksabhaa kii paanch siton main se ek or madhya pradesh kii 29 siton main se sirf teen siten hi sapa ko saunpi hai
 Akhilesh Yadav also has a challenge to convince the already unhappy senior party leaders to justify this mismatched seat sharing with the BSP
 haalanki sapa ke rashtriya sanghathan mantri or mukhya pravaktaa rajendra choudhary kehete hai, ''basapa ke saath siton kaa talmail paraspar sahmati or sammaan ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi kiya gaya he
 In a press conference on January 12 at the Taj Hotel in Bantvaralkhanau, Mayawati had announced to contest 38-38 seats of BSP and SP
 haalanki rashtriya lokdal (areldi) ke liye do siten chodi gai thim lekin baad main akhilesh yadav ne sapa ke cote kii ek seat chhodkar 37 siton par loksabhaa chunaav laduya sweekaar kar liya
 "the party which has won 39 Lok Sabha seats in UP in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, has won more than the BSP Lok Sabha seats every time," says a legislative council member of SP close to Mulayam Singh Yadav
 Fighting is beyond comprehension
 '' sapa ne bhale hi apane cote kii seat areldi ke liye chodi hai lekin iskaa zyada phayda basapa ko milane kii ummid he
 The BSP will contest in western UP seats like rld-dominated Bijnor, Nagina, Amroha, Meerut, Saharanpur, Gautam Budh Nagar, Aligarh, Agra, Fatehpur Sikri, while sp's account of rld-dominated Kairana, Ghaziabad, Hathras, Sambhal, Moradabad Only seats have come
 sapa ke hisse main ai kul 37 siton main se 19 aisi hai jin par 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko sapa or basapa ko mili kul maton se adhik mat mili the
 At the same time, there are only 14 such seats in bsp's account (see graphics)
 itnaa hi nahin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 5 siten jeetne vaali sapa 31 par duusare number par thi lekin inamen se 11 siton par ab basapa chunaav ladegi, jabaki basapa kul 34 siton par duusare number par thi or inamen se keval 8 siten hi sapa ke hisse main ai hai (dekhen graphics), jaahir he, sapa kii majbootee kaa zyada phayda basapa ko ho saktaa he jabaki sapa is maamle main bhi peeche he
 There is also a very tough challenge in front of the SP to face the BJP on seats like Varanasi, Lucknow
 sapa ke vidhaan parishad sadsy udaiveer singh kehete hai, ''siton kaa bantwaaraa jeetne kii kshamta ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 This will become clear after the election results
 ''shivpal kii chunautimulaayam ke kareebi netaa or sapa sarkaar main cabinet mantri rahe shiv pratap beria kanpur dehaat ke prabhaavshaalee netaaon main hai

 Says Beria, "senior SP leaders are upset with seat sharing and many of them may leave the bicycle
" '' upi kii 43 loksabhaa siten aisi hai jin par sapa kaa koi ummidavaar nahin hoga
 On these seats, Shivpal has started to increase the support base of his party by contacting the old ally SP leaders
 shivpal yadav kehete hai, ''akhilesh kii raajnneeti ne sapa ko sadak par laa diya he
 By giving old SP leaders a place in his party, Shivpal Yadav has presented an open challenge to the alliance
 sapa ke purv saansad raghuraaj singh shakya, purv vidhayak manik chandra yadav, chah baar vidhayak chune gaye purv mantri kamaal yusuf malik, sapa ke sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav kii patni ke rishtedaar purv vidhayak pramod gupta jaise netaaon ko piespiel kaa mahasachiv banaakar shivpal yadav ne parivaar ke jhagade ko rajnatik ladaai main bhi tabdeel kiya he
 Shivpal is constantly contacting old SP leaders by holding meetings and meetings in Yadav-dominated seats

 By sending PSPL leaders to the houses of Yadavs suffering from SC-ST Act in BSP Raj, Shivpal is appealing to them not to come under the guise of SP
 sapa pravaktaa abdul hafeez gandhi kehete hai, ''samaajawaadee vichaardhaara se bhatak chuke netaa hi sapa chhod duusari partiyon main ja rahe hai
 With their departure, the SP and BSP alliance is getting stronger

 In Maharashtra, the Supreme Court has reprimanded the Maharashtra government in the case of child deaths due to malnutrition this year
 supreme court ne kaha, bacchon kii maut se aapako koi fark nahin pad rahaa
 If the state government is not paying any attention, then you (lawyer) are not taking any instructions from the government

 hamane media report dekhi hai ki maharashtra main 500-600 bacchon kii kuposhan se maut hui he
 You think that in a country with a large population, some people die from malnutrition does not matter

 yachikakarta kii ore se court main bataaya gaya ki pichley saal kii tarah is baar bhi 21 rajyon ke 115 jilon main halaat kharaab hai, lekin rajyon ne inhen sookhaa prabhavit ghoshit karne ke liye koi kadam nahin uthaaya

 sitambar main bhi rajyon ko duusari adwyjuri bheji gai
 Declaring drought is up to the states

 The Center believes that there is no reason for states not to declare drought

 aagaamee dilli chunaavon main trishanku vidhansabha kii sthiti banane par congress aam aadmi party (AAP) ko samarthan dene ko taiyaar he
 Saying this, former Delhi Chief Minister and Congress leader Sheila Dixit shocked on Thursday
 haalanki aam aadmi party ne fouran hi is sambhavit peshkash ko thukraa diya
 Sheila Dixit said, 'the argument says that we would like a stable government
 isliye agar jarurat padi to sampradayik takaton ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye ham AAP ko tarjeeh denge
 However, when he was asked about the possibility of an alliance between the AAP and the Congress, he denied it
 Congress makes headline for the first time in this Delhi election, obviously for wrong reasons
 a non-player desperately looking for a role! AAP netaa manish sisodiya ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki congress 70 main se ek bhi seat nahin jeetne vaali
 We are confident of coming to power on our own
 ' ek tivi channel se baatcheet main AAP sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki kya congress chunaav se pehle hi haar maan chuki he, jo hamen samarthan pesh kar rahi he? unhone kaha ki main logon se apil karata hum ki ve congress ko haragij vot na karen kyonki yah vot kharaab karne ke baraabar he
 However, Sheila Dixit's statement cannot be considered a formal statement of the Congress
 kyonki vah in dinon raajnneetik rup se haashiye par hai
 He is neither the face of the party nor actively involved in election strategy and other processes
 haalanki bijepi ek baar phir ise AAP or congress kii dosti kii tarah pesh kar rahi he
 BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that if the Congress is at hand then the AAP is its gloves
 ve haath jinamein jhaadu hai, ve sab jaanate hai
 Significantly, Delhi may have assembly elections in February
 iske maddenjar sabhi partiyaan chunaav prachaar main juty hai
 After the 2013 elections, the Aam Aadmi Party formed the government with the outside support of the Congress, but only after 49 days, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal resigned due to not passing the Jan Lokpal law

 taliban dehshatgardon ke peshawar main 16 disambar ko 130 se zyada schuli bacchon ke katleam ne pakistan ko buree tarah hilaa diya he
 This shocked the whole world
 yah vaardaat haalanki jihadiyon kii barbarta kaa koi pehla namoona nahin he, bas iske sangeen hote jane kii gavaah he
 Over the years, militants who grew up in Pakistan have dropped bombs on Shia and Ahmadi mosques, Sunni dargahs, churches and Hindu temples
 taliban 2009 se ab tak skulon par hajaar se zyada hamale kar chukaa he, jinamein zyaadaatar uttar-pashchimi pakhtoonkhwaa praant main hai
 Over the years, the jihadis have been targeted by ISI offices in several cities, naval and air force bases in Karachi and Kamra, Karachi International Airport and even the military headquarters
 itane bade paimaane par aatanki hamale bhi agar pakistan se uski jihadiyon ko shah dene kii fitrat nahin mitaa paae hai to kya yah mana jaae ki peshawar ke skool main masuumon kii hatya or shikshakon ko jinda jala die jane kii vaardaat uskaa iraadaa badal degi?peshawar katleam ke fouran baad islamabad kii ku khyath laal masjid ke moulana abdul ajij ne taliban kii is harakat kii ninda karne se inkaar kar diya, jisase jihadiyon kii jid or jadta hi ujagar hoti he
 Imran Khan, sympathetic to the Taliban, condemned the attack in round words without naming the attackers
 pakistani hukmaranon ke ek or chahete lashkar-e-taiyaba / jamaat-ud-daawa ke hafiz mohammad said ne tivi par bharat ko taliban ke is hamale kaa kusuuravaar tehra diya or iskaa badla lene kii kasam khai
 The roots of the jihadi idea in Pakistan are in fact rooted in the anti-india obsession in the power-establishment there, whose back end is stuck in the principle of division, two nations and the fear that powerful countries want to break Pakistan
 pakistan kii 1971 main hui tut or bangladesh ke ban jane se yah sanak majboot hui he
 Instead, it would have been better if the elite Punjabi section of the country could understand how to protect the country on the ground of reality according to the size and strength of Pakistan
 pakistan kaa vajood uski jaateey, bhashaayi or saamudayik vividhta ke badale majahab or vichaardhaara ke aadhaar par kaayam kiya gaya he
 As a result, the country's view of national security is motivated by religion and ideology rather than practical
 pakistan kii faujee or naagarik naukarshahi haalanki british raaj main hi kaayam hui, lekin uskaa najariya or fitrat kahin zyada ‘‘pakistan ke majahabi vajood’’ se tay hoti rahi he
 Those professional methods usually do not help in making decisions, which they often do in front of outsiders
 pakistan or jehadi vichaar ke bich ke rishte ko tab tak nahin samajha ja saktaa jab tak aap is desh ke buniyadi pahalu ko nahin samajhate
 Pakistan's national narrative, national fabric and national identity are all built around Islam
 pakistan kii paidaaish ke shuruaati 30 varshon ke dauraan gharelu niti ko majahabi aadhaar par or videsh niti ko akhil islamic daayre main chalaane kii baaten hoti thim
 Then, in the remaining 30 years, the global jihadist idea has been the basis of its security and foreign policy
 pakistani fouj ke teen cmanderon general parvej musharraf, general ashfak kayaani or general rahil sharif ne bhale hi pakistan ke bheetar jehadi asar ko kam karne kii koshishen kii hai, jisamen faujee abhiyaanon kaa bhi sahaara liya gaya he, lekin unki koshishen desh kii buniyadi manyataon ke chalate hameshaa adhuri rahi hai
 The idea of pakistan and to justify it, the false history taught in the schools there has created sympathy for Sharia, Islamic Khilafat and Islamic State in the society
 yahi vichaar un 33 se zyada dehshatgard samoohon ke paksh main kaam karata he jo pakistan ke bheetar hai
 Pakistan's rulers have no problem in eliminating global terrorists and local jihadists while supporting regional jihadis, but ordinary people have a different view towards jihadi groups
 badakismati yah he ki jo log taharik-e-taliban pakistan ko khatm karnaa chaahate hai, shariya or pashchimi mulyon ke khilaaf khud unheen kii raay iske aade aati he, kyonki yah duusare jehadi guton ke samarthakon se mail khaati he, bhale hi unke tareekon se aam log nafrat karte hon
 For most countries, nuclear weapons are the ultimate guarantee against attacks on them, but protection is not enough for advocates of "pakistan's basic ideas"
 do rashtron ke siddhant ke bheetar hi muslim pakistan or hindu bharat ke bich ek tarah kii tulana he
 The events of the last 67 years have made the Doctrine of India irrelevant
 aaj pakistan, bharat or bangladesh main rahane vaale musalamaanon kii sankhya mote taur par baraabar he or is upmahadweep main pakistan se baahar rahane vaale musalamaanon kii sankhya pakistan ke mukaable zyada he
 But the basic concept of Pakistan demands the condition that it should abide by the obligation of Muslim nationality and equalize India
 dikkat yah he ki pakistan kaa aakaar or uski arthvyavastha use aisa karne kii chhot nahin detii jabaki bharat kahin zyada bada he or lagaataar sampann hota ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, during the Cold War, Pakistan has no longer got the strength gained by the West, especially from the US
 yahi vajah he ki pakistan ke hukmaranon ke paas jihadiyon ke jariye ek chhadam jang chhedgaye ke alaava or koi ranneetik vikalp nahin rah gaya he
 The other way would have been to work for security and prosperity for the country's population, but the rulers in Islamabad have not paid much attention to it
 kaumi nazariye kaa dabaansal main haal main peshawar kii vaardaat jaisi kai dardanaak vaardaaton ke baavjood pakistaniyon ko ab bhi pakistan kaa buniyadi vichaar apil karata he
 In 1947, the country had got few resources and was in crisis from the beginning
 vibhaajan ke dauraan hue dangon or jammu-kashmir ke chale jane kii ghatana ne pakistan kii neenv rakhane vaali peedi ko alag se jakhm die
 The country was saved because the people here had patience and the rulers used the conditions of the Cold War era
 kashmir main pakistan ne pehali faujee chadhaai 1948 main kii jisamen afghanistan se lagi sarhad ke kabaili ilaakon ke lashkar shaamil the
 These fighters had increased the strength of the Pakistani army
 sindhu kinare kashmir main kabailiyon ko jehad par lagane kii vajah is andeshe main chhipi thi ki ve pakhtunistan kii maang ke sangharsh main shaamil na ho jaaen, jisaki vakaalat us vakt khan abdul gaffaar khan or afghanistan kii sarkaar kar rahi thi
 In this way, there was sympathy for the non-government armed factions tied to the communist perspective in Pakistan, which maintained their activities as opposed to the tactics of the military rulers
 assi ke dashak main pakistan kii is niti ko achaanak protsaahan mila jab america ne soviet sangh kaa muqabla karne ke liye afghanistan main mujahidin ko samarthan dene kaa faisla kiya
 The influx of arms, money and fighters began to flow in large numbers and Pakistan's military commanders started training camps for fighters not only in Afghanistan but also in Jammu and Kashmir
 aaj isi kaa nateeja he ki tamaam aatanki sanghathan pakistan se kaam kar rahe hai or unhen shaharon or gaanvon main surakshit thikaane mili hue hai
 Some of them target Muslim sects and religious minorities like sipah-e-sahaba, anti-india organizations like lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed, anti-afghanistan Mullah Omar has a Taliban and Haqqani network, while the Pakistani army itself In the war against Mubtila tehreek-e-taliban is Pakistan
 pakistan main aatankwaad kii prakruti main pehla nirnaayak mode 9 / 11 ke hamale or uske baad afghanistan par america ghuspaith se aayaa
 General Musharraf severely severed his ties with the Taliban government of Kabul and supported the US military campaign there
 bharat ke saath aman bahaali kii prakriya ko aage badhaane ke liye unhone jammu-kashmir main aatanki gatividhiyon par kuch lagaam lagaai
 In April 1999, Musharraf told a group of retired military officers, "the Taliban are my strategic treasure and i can leave them open to tens of thousands against India whenever i want
" ’’ 2002 aate-aate unka sur badal gaya tha or unhone lashkar-e-taiyaba jaise samoohon par maamuli bandish laga di, lekin in pratibandhit sanghathanon or inke netaaon ko nae naamon se kaam karne kii chhot de di gai
 Under Musharraf, Pakistan began to differentiate between the jihadi groups
 al kaayda ke saath rishton vaale videshi aatankiyon ko jahaan america ko supurd kar diya jaataa, vahiin sthaneey or kshetreey aatankiyon (kattarpathiyon, bharat virodhiyon or afgaan virodhiyon) ko khulaa chhod diya gaya
 Some terrorists had developed the ability to challenge government orders under the Pakistani military's nose
 inhone beete varshon main pakistan or afghanistan main surakshabalon ko baari nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 Other groups such as the Haqqani network were "managed" by Pakistani intelligence agencies to influence Afghanistan's activities
 pakistan main bad rahe gharelu aatankwaad kii maujuuda samasya usee niti kaa parinaam he
 The country may make a difference between the terrorists but the jihadis largely cooperate and sympathize with each other
 is tarah hota yah he ki satta pratishthan samarthit jehadi ant main un aatankiyon kaa samarthan kar baithte hai jo pakistani fouj or aam logon ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 In the case of ideologically motivated terrorists it often happens that the principle over strategy is overshadowed and as far as the case of the jihadis, who are getting the support of the Pakistani government, they also consider the fighters who make the country more Islamic
 Are active in the direction
 south asian terarysm portal ke anusaar, 2003 se 2014 ke bich 19,152 aam logon or 5,839 surakshakarmiyon ne aatankwaadi hamalon main apni jaan ganvaa di he
 It does not include children killed in the recent Peshawar attack
 islam aadhaarit kaumi ekta ke prati pakistan kii nishtha ne kattarpanthi guton ko unka prasar karne or bina zyada aadchan ke baari maatra main rakam jutaney main madad kii he
 Furthermore, the military and intelligence systems have been strong but the local police have never been provided with the political help, resources and training that would have enabled them to fight these terrorist groups
 kharaab prashikshan or post manobal vaale polisbal kaa hi nateeja he ki kuch sanghathan shahari kendron main agava-phiroti kaa dhandha chalaate hai
 Apart from this, they also raise money from drug trafficking and smuggled goods business
 is tarah aatanki sanghathanon ke paas apni gatividhiyon ke liye paise jutaney kaa vyavasthit tantra maujuud he jisase ve tab bhi kaam karte rahenge jab desh unhen khatm karne kaa aakhri faisla le legaa
 At present, such a decision seems unlikely
 pakistan barason se shuturamurg kii tarah ji rahaa he
 For years he continued to deny support to the Afghan Taliban or to have Kashmiri jihadi training camps
 osama bin laden samet al kaayda ke netaaon ke vajood ko assi ke dashak main rus virdohi jehad main pakistan kii sanliptata se judi chook kaa parinaam bataaya gaya
 Refusal, however, does not lead to the way forward
 pakistan ke islam aadhaarit rashtrawaad ne kattarta ko paala-posa, aarthik tarakkee ko kam kiya or uski antarrashtriya saakh ko batta lagaaya he
 We do not yet know to what extent the ideology has penetrated within the Pakistani army, which is one of the strongest institutions in the country
 (islamabad main may main jamaat-ud-daawa ke netaa hafiz said kii raily)naakaam rajya-tantrakai aise udhaaharan hai jab faujee afasaron, non-kamishand afasaron or fouj ke sahyogiyon ne jihadiyon ko sahyog kiya he yaa phir fouj kii naukari chhodkar jehadi samoohon main shaamil ho gaye hai
 The Pakistani establishment keeps the information related to this matter confidential, which makes it difficult to assess any problem
 pakistan ke nausainik adde mehraan par 2011 main hua hamalaa, vaayu sena adde kamra main 2012 kaa hamalaa or 2014 main al kaayda in da indian sabacontinent (acuies) kii karachi harbar main ek nausainik pot par kabje kii naakaam koshish is baat kii ore sanket hai ki sashastr balon ke bheetar jehadi asar kaayam he
 In the light of the withdrawal of American and NATO forces from Afghanistan, it is unlikely that the Pakistani establishment would let go of decades of hard work to establish its supreme power over Afghanistan
 antarrashtriya dabaavon or gharelu morche par taliban kii badhati chunautiyon ke maddenjar pakistan ne uttari wajiristaan main gyaat jehadi thikaanon ko saaf kar daalaa he
 This has deprived Afghan groups such as the Haqqani network from their headquarters
 pakistan ne haalanki kabhi bhi afgaan taliban ke khilaaf koi kadam nahin uthaaya or mana jaataa he ki hakkaani network ne apana mukhyalay phata main duusare ilaakon main sthapit kar liya he
 Pakistan's policy in the near future will be to carry out a dialogue process with Afghanistan and the US government, whose stated objective is to reach an agreement with the Taliban

 sangh main aise halaat pehle bhi bane hai, magar baat tut tak nahin pahunchi
 In the 2002 assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, a separate political platform was supported by senior RSS officials

 Similarly, the rebellion of Keshubhai Patel in Gujarat was supported by a senior Sangh functionary, but that rebellion got entangled
