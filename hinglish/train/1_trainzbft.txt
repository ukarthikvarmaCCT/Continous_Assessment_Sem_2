 On Wednesday, BJP President Amit Shah was in Karnataka and garlanded the idol of Basaveshwara Bhagwan
 lekin is dauraan kuch aisa hua jisaki shah ne ummid nahin kii thi
 Actually, the statue of Lord Basaveshwara in Bangalore where Shah reached to offer garlands was very high
 amit shah or bies yediurppa ko kraine ke jariye murti ke paas tak pahunchaaya gaya
 But when Shah put the garland, the garland could not reach the idol
 par isse ulat jab yediurppa ne maala pahanaai to thik tarah se murti ke gale main pahunchi
 Amit Shah smiled at this

 Only after a long time did the crane come on par with the idol
 or uske baad hi amit shah murti main maala pahana paae
 Significantly, there have been many such mistakes during the election campaign with Amit Shah earlier also

 unhen kaam se nikaal diya ja saktaa he jabaki pita banane vaale purushon ko akasar naukari yaa kaarysthal par badhaava miltaa he
 This research-related conclusion about what researchers say was published in the Journal of Applied Psychology
 isamen is baat kii pushti kii gai he ki maa banane vaali auraton ko aisa mahasoos hota he ki ab kaarysthal par unka achche se swaagat nahin kiya jayega
 Researchers at Florida State University say this is the first study done on women who feel they will be fired during pregnancy
 management ke sahaayak adhyaaapak pustian anderdol ne kaha, "hamane paaya ki mahilaon ne jab apane garbhvatee hone kaa khulaasa kiya to unhone kaarysthal par protsaahan kaa anubhav kam kiya
 "pustian adds," When women mentioned this to their managers or co-workers, we saw a decrease in the rate of encouragement in their career, while the rate of encouragement for men increased
 
 "nishkarsh pah pahunchane ke liye pustian ne do siddhanton kii gaharaai se adhyayan kiya
 At first it was found that pregnant women are afraid of being fired
 duusare main pustian ne paaya ki mahilaon ko aisa is vajah se lagata he ki kyonki garbhavastha ke dauraan nijee jindagi or kariyar ke kshetra main kai badlaav aate hai
 Some new things have been described in the research as to how to treat pregnant women at workplace
 pustian ke anusaar, "maa banane vaali mahilaon ke prati kariyar se judi protsaahan ko kam nahin kiya janaa chahie
 In addition, managers should provide as much social and career-related support to both mothers and fathers as possible to help them perform their responsibilities related to work and family
 " Karni Sena protested for three consecutive months for not allowing the film Padmavat to be released, now news has come that Karni Sena has praised the film, withdrawing its protest
 ise karani sena kaa you turn mana gaya
 But Shri Rajput Karni Sena chief Lokendra Singh Kalvi has described these reports as baseless
 darasal, shri rashtriya rajput karani sena- maharashtra ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh yogendra singh kataar ne chitthee likh kaha tha ki unhone 2 farvari ko padmavat dekhi he, jisamen rajputon kii veerta or tyaag kaa bahut sundar chithran kiya gaya he
 The film is dedicated to the greatness of Rani Padmavati
 amitabh ne padmavat ke liye di badhai, deepika ne kaha- thankyuu babaaise film main rani padmavati or allaudin ke bich koi bhi seen nahin he
 There is nothing in this film that harms the history and sentiments of Rajput society
 ham is film se purnataa santusht hai
 Therefore we withdraw our agitation / protest unconditionally
 hit hone ke baavjood padmavat ko hua karodon kaa nuksaan, ye he abtak kii kamamb in khabaron kaa khandan karte hue shrirajput karani sena ke pramukh lokentre singh kalvi ne IANS se baatcheet main kaha he, bharat main farji karani sena paidaa ho gai he
 At present, eight armies with the same name are operating in the country
 kalvi ne kaha ki film padmavat par bain nahin lagane kii vajah logon main naaraazgi badi he, jiske kaaran bhaajapa kii rajasthan ke upachunaav main haar hui he
 In the future, the BJP may have to bear the brunt of this

 Hair is the most important part of our beauty
 yahi kaaran he ki mahila ho yaa purush sabhi ko apane baalo se bahut pyaar hota he
 Every woman wants to wear long, thick and shiny hair
 lekin kai baar tamaam koshishon ke baad bhi lambebalpana ek sapana ban hi rah jaataa he
 But you do not have to worry, we are giving you some special tips, which you will be able to long after following
 aise karen baalo kii dekhbhaal-trimming-aap agar lambey bal chaahati hai to kam se kam 8 se 10 hafton ke baad trimming jarur karaaen
 Trimming allows hair to grow quickly
 pradooshan or suraj kii kirnon se bal damege ho jate hai, jisase split ands ho jate hai
 These split ends prevent hair from growing
 isliye trim karaate rahanaa chahie
 The trim cuts split ends and causes hair to grow
 condishning- aapane aksar dekha hoga ki baalo kii jadon ke mukaable neeche ke bal zyada ruukhe or bejaan hote hai
 The main reason for this is that the lower part of the hair is not nourished properly
 isliye baalo ko condishan karnaa behad jaruri hota he, kyonki isse bal damege hone se batch jate hai
 Also, childbirds are made
 garm tel se massage karen-baalo main garm tel se massage karnaa baalo ke liye sabase behtareen opshan he
 Massaging with hot oil once a week is very important for healthy hair
 telki massage karne se jhadate baalo kii samasya se bhi raahat milti he
 If you want to make your hair longer, it would be better to massage coconut or olive oil in your hair
 baalo main kanghee karen-baalo main kanghee karnaa utana hi jaruri he, jitna kii tel kii massage
 But for this, using the right comb is also very important
 kanghee karne se scalp main blad cirkulation thik tarah se hota he
 Be sure to comb before sleeping
 isse jade majboot hoti hai or bal bhi jaldi lambey hote hai
 Yes, very soon, notes made of plastic will start running in the market
 rigerv bank of india is yojana par kaam kar rahi he taaki jaali note kii samasya par kaabo paaya ja sake
 An economic paper has reported this
 bataaya jaataa he ki agle saal tak is tarah ke plastic se bane note jari kar die jaaenge jinamein behatar security feechar honge
 Another major reason behind issuing plastic notes is that paper notes have a shorter life
 ve jaldi kharaab ho jate hai or pani tathaa nami ko jhel nahin pate
 The Reserve Bank has said in its annual report that currency notes should remain in circulation for longer and their lives are longer, the bank is going to make such arrangements
 bank ne janvari main plastic note chhapane ke liye ek tender jari kiya tha
 Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said in May that these notes would be issued in 2015
 in noton ko pehle paanch shaharon main jari kiya jayega
 These are Kochi, Mysore, Jaipur, Bhubaneshwar and Shimla
 in shaharon ke alag-alag vaataavaran ke kaaran inhen chunaa gaya he
 First low-denomination notes will be issued
 plastic noton kii ek khubi hoti he ki un par jaldi daag nahin padate or ve jaldi nahin fatate
 Plastic notes are in circulation in many countries

 yahaan lalakeshwar ke ek rishtedaar kaa ghar he
 But the SIT had a clue about it, that is why when both of them came out of here with the intention of hiding in an ashram, the SIT was ambushed and arrested
 lalakeshwar apane bete ke saale vikaschand ke bahanoi ke ghar chipa tha
 Vikaschand is the one whom Lalkeshwar kept for the transaction

 After this, they were issued wrong admit card from the board
 parikshaarthiyon ko admit card main gadabadi ko dur karne ke liye college ke pricipal ko adhikaar de die jate the
 They rectified the details of the admit card of the candidates and issued the admission cart with signature and seal

 When the picture of record-breaking copy was violated all over the world, this time the government showed readiness to stop copying
 or nakal na ke baraabar hone diya
 But vicious Kingping like Lalakeshwar was allowed to continue as president, but here too he did not leave his bets but did not let the copy take place but after the exam the game of raising the number and topping it was played openly
 nateeja 'aaj tak' ne jab iskaa khulaasa kiya tab sarkaar neend se jaagi
 And on 8 June, Lalkeshwar was removed from the post

 -input bhashaa se a unique astronomical event is going to happen on the coming Monday i
e
 9th May
 ye khagoleey ghatana he budh pargaman yani marakari transit
 Yekhgolan event will begin at noon on 9 May
 budh pargaman kii khagoleey ghatana puure bharat main dekhi ja sakegi
 The last time this astronomical event occurred was in 2006
 kya hota he budh pargaman?budh pargam wo khagoleey ghatana he jisamen suraj or prithvi ke bich se hokar budh grah gujarata he or teenon akashiya pind ek sidhi rekha main hote hai
 In such a situation, the planet Mercury looks like a small black dot on the sun's circle
 suraj ke gole ke mukaable budh grah kaa koniya aakaar kaaphi kam hota he lihaaja budh grah ek choti si kaali bindi kii tarah dikhataa he
 The incident of Mercury transit begins when the planet of Mercury is seen touching the sun's circle
 isko budh pargaman kaa pehla sparsh kaha jaataa he
 As soon as the sphere of the planet Mercury reaches inside the circle of the sun
 isko budh pargaman kaa dwitiya yani doosraa sparsh kaha jaataa he
 After this, the black dot of the planet Mercury is seen moving on the shell of the sun
 jab budh grah kaa gola suraj ke gole phir se andar kii taraf se choota he to ise budh pargaman kaa tritiy yani teesraa sparsh kaha jaataa he
 When the small circle of Mercury planet completely crosses the circle of the sun, it is called the fourth touch i
e
 the fourth touch and with this the astronomical phenomenon of Mercury transit is over
 budh pargaman kii khagoleey ghatana main amuman saadhe 7 ghante kaa vakt lagata he
 Why does Mercury look like black dot in transit? Budh planet is the nearest planet to the sun, occurring 13-14 times in a century
 suraj kii tarah isaki apni roshni nahin hoti
 When we come between the Earth and the Sun, we see that part of Mercury where there is no sunlight
 lihaaja chamakdaar suraj ke gole par pargaman ke dauraan budh kaali bindi kii tarah najar aata he
 Mercury transit is a rare inertial phenomenon
 ek shatabdi main ye amuman 13 yaa 14 baar ghatit hoti he
 The special thing is that Mercury transit happens only and only in May or November
 november ke maheene main hue pargaman ke baad agle november main 7, 13 yaa 33 saal ke antaraal par hi budh pargaman hota he
 So the Mercury transit that happened in the month of May takes place again in the month of May at an interval of 13 or 33 years
 kaise dekhen budh pargaman?budh kaa golasuraj ke gole ke muqablemhaj 158 hissaa he
 Also the brightness and heat of the sun can blind anyone
 is vajah se budh pargaman dekh panaasan nahin he
 Take special care in watching Mercury transit or else you can become blind
 doorabeen par khaas tarah kaa solar filter lagaakar budh pargaman ko dekhaja saktaa he
 Mercury transit can be observed by applying certified solar filters and solar glasses
 suraj ko sidhe nangi ankhon se dekhne kii koshish katai na karenisse aapaki ankhon kii roshni ja sakati he

 america channel sienen ko die ek intervyuu main jakarberg ne yah bharosa diya
 He acknowledged that many countries, such as Russia, had tried to influence the US election, and he also described what measures Facebook had taken to thwart these efforts
 bhartiya chunaavon ke bare main sawaal par jakarberg ne kaha ki fasebuk bharat sahit sabhi deshon main hone vaale chunaavon main kisi bahari tatv ke dakhal par ankush ke liye kai tarah ke kadam uthaa rahaa he

 apane post main unhone bataaya he ki company ne is maamle main abhi tak kai kadam uthaae hai or aage bhi kade kadam uthaa sakati he
 Zuckerberg has admitted his mistake in the case of Cambridge Analytica
 dakshin bhartiya nivasee mannargudi mafia kaa naam aate hi samaj jate hai ki baat shashikala kii ho rahi he
 Yes, the same Sasikala Natarajan who has been both right and left hand of Jayalalithaa
 antim samay tak ve jayalalita ke paas raheen
 Who decided to meet them, who did not - she continued to decide
 dosti kii baat karen to jayalalita or shashikala ke naam bhi ab ek-duusare ke bina adhure lagate hai
 This story of their friendship is also about love, attachment, promises and then in the relationship
 bilkul bollywood film kii tarah
 Doctor's statement on Jayalalithaa's 'death Mystery - Death due to Organ Failure' When the news came that speculations had started when Jayalalithaa had been expelled from the party that was living with her for more than two decades
 yahi nahin jayalalita ne shashikala aar unke parivaar ko apane ghar se bhi baahar nikaal diya tha
 The story is not so much
 thodaa peeche chalate hai
 Sasikala was a housewife who always dreamed of working in films and living life like a star
 unke pati aar natarajan tamilnadu sarkaar main public relation officer the
 He was close to Collector VS Chandralekha of Cuddalore district at that time
 chandralekha tamilnadu ke mukhyamantri em ji ramachandran ke kareebi the
 'chinamma' on the chair but 'amma' is still in the heart of AIADMK leaders as everyone close to MGR and Jayalalitha knows that they were bringing Jayalalithaa into politics at that time
 duusari ore shashikala ne video camera kharidkar apane mohalle main shaadiyon ko shoot karnaa aarambh kar diya tha
 At that time she told Chandralekha that she wanted to make a video on Jayalalithaa
 phir chandralekha unhen jayalalita ke paas le gayi, phir kya hua vah itihaas ban gaya
 Jayalalithaa suffered a heart attack, then admitted to the CCU, was sent to the pro-india Today Conclave outside Apollo and was swayed by Sasikalapuri Kaman Sasikala, followed by a friendship between Sasikala and Jayalalithaa
 1987 main mjiaar kii maut ke baad jayalalita bilkul akeli rah gai thim
 Supporters of mgr's wife Janaki were on the streets against him
 is bich unhen shashikala se saport mila
 In 1991, when Jayalalithaa became the Chief Minister of the state, Sasikala had become a visible face with her
 jayalalita kii jagah vahi mantriyon se baat karti thim
 Used to order them
 jayalalita kii bhatiji deepa kii party kaa naam hoga- ol india ammaa dravid kashgam !yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki jayalalita hameshaa hi shashikala ke parivaar ke logon se ghiri rahati thim or koi un tak pahunch hi nahin paata tha
 Gradually, this started to be called Mannargudi Mafia because Sasikala was born in Mannargudi itself
 yah bhi sabko pataa he ki shashikala 1989 se hi jayalalita ke saath rah rahi thim
 She brought 40 servants from her native state of Mannargudi who ran Jayalalithaa's entire house
 isamen maid, rasoiyaa, driver, mali aadi sabhi tarah ke kaam shaamil the
 Fad habits that did not live even untouched
 
 
 shashikala ne hi sahyog dekar apane sabhi parivaar janon ko 1996 tak amir banaaya
 Sasikala and her family members have been known for their greed and mis-earning money in the entire state
 yahaan tak ki tamilnadu main udhyam sthapit karne ke liye bhi is mafia ko paisa khilaane kaa rivaaj tha
 Nothing would happen without them
 1996 ke pradesh chunaavon main jayalalita kii haar kaa kaaran bhi yah tha
 Later Jayalalithaa realized these things but by then it was late
 unki tabiyat kharaab hui or ve doctor ke paas pahunchin to pataa laga ki unhen kaaphi kam maatra main chemical substensij, jinamein kaaphi kam maatra main arsenic hota tha, die jate rahe
 After this Jayalalitane told this brigade to get away from themselves
 par march 2012 main ek baar phir donon ke bich kii dooriyaan khatm huin
 It is a puzzle for everyone even today, why Jayalalitha forgave Sasikala, why she found herself unable to walk without Sasikala
 
 
 baharhaal ab to shashikala tamilnadu kii satta kii bagdor sanbhaalane ke liye taiyaar hai

 Sometimes even a black mole on your partner's body suddenly makes the heart beat
 gaalon, hothon, gardan yaa anya kisi bhi bhaag par til khubsuurati main purajor ijapha kar detaa he
 This is the reason why the discussion of sesame is also found in Maharishi Vatsyayan's classical work 'kamasutra'
 mordan filmkaaron ne bhi til ko puraa bhav dete hue kai geet superhit karaae
 The song of the 80s is 'gaalon Pe Mere Jo Mole Til', the love of lovers, the life of poets

 By the way, this small mole plays a good role in provoking the fire of love, there is no scope for doubt

 But if the girl from Jammu and Kashmir marries an Indian citizen, she will lose the right to property

 Therefore, with this law being abolished, both Farooq Abdullah's son Omar Abdullah and his daughter will get equal rights

 For Sonakshi Sinha, few words are accurate and she is confident, grounded and creative
 zyada glamras or hot avatar main sonakshisonakshi kahati hai ki bhale hi vah ek star kii beti hai lekin ghar main nakhre dikhaane kii unhen jaraa bhi ijaajat nahin he
 Like normal houses, his mother shouts at him for getting up late and not cleaning the room
 logon ko yah sunne main bhale hi ajeeb lagata ho lekin hakeekat yahi he ki hamaare mata-pita ne is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa ki ham kisi jaani-maani hasti ke bacchon ke taur par logon ke saamne nahin aae
 We rode in auto and i used to go by local train to college
 hamaari parvarish ekadam saamaanya parivaar ke bacchon kii tarah hui he
 Sonakshi Sinha's unseen pictures she still lives like a normal girl in Mumbai
 chhuttiyon ke din vah apane doston ke saath filmein dekhakar bitaana pasand karti hai or zyada se zyada sona pasand karti hai
 Sonakshi says that apart from work, i am a very lazy girl
 main chuttee ke din sab kasar puri karti hum, main soti hum, main ghoomane jaati hum, baahar khaanaa khaati hum, kitaab padhati hum
 On asking Sonakshi if she is able to give less time to the family due to her busy schedule, she says, 'she manages
 shooting par roj janaa hota he isliye jo vakt miltaa he mai parivaar waalon ke saath bitaati hum
 There is a problem during shooting outside
 kai baar maa mujhase milane hi aa jaati hai
 'I never thought about acting,' says Sonakshi
 main bahut moti thi or dilli main fishan digining kaa course kar rahi thi
 Never thought of coming to this area during studies
 sonakshi ke jivan main parivartan tab aayaa jab unhone 30 kilo vajan ghataya or arbaj or salmaan ne unhen apane nae project ke liye chunaa
 When both of them brought me the script of 'dabangg', i could not refuse them
 lekin mujhe taiyaari ke liye samay nahin mila
 Sonakshi's first film became a superhit
 iske baad se hi unke paas filmon ke ofer, vigyapanon kii jhadi lag gai
 She became a star even before Sonakshi could understand anything
 sonakshi kahati hai ki star vaali baat ghar main nahin hoti thi, lekin baahar jane par log autograph ke liye aate the
 She says, 'I am not a size zero like other heroines but i am satisfied with my weight
 meraa maananaa he ki aatmavishvaas jaruri he
 i have learned the tricks of facing every situation from my father
 shuru-shuru main akhabaaron main aane vaali afvaahen mujhe pareshaan karti thi, mujhe lagata tha ki log mere bare main is tarah kii baaten kaise likh sakate hai
 Then one day Salman told me that people should not say anything about you, it is better to say something about you because that will make you popular
 pyaar ke bare main poochne par sonakshi ne rata hua jawaab diya ki unhen ek parfect insaan kaa intjaar he jo unhen samajhe
 Sonakshi is also a fashion designer
 fishan ke bare main sonakshi kahati hai ki mujhe jeens tishart pasand he
 i like the simple dress to go anywhere

 The laborers working in the fields are risking their lives for just 25 rupees
 yahi wo rakam he jo jahrile prabhaav vaale kitnashkon ke 15 litre ke kanistar kaa kheton main chhidkaav karne ke liye mazdooron ko milti he
 In many places it was found that the laborers worked continuously in two shifts, spraying up to 300 liters of pesticides in one day
 maharashtra ke yavatmal jile main agast se ab tak kitnashkon ke jehar se 18 kisaanon or kheti mazdooron kii maut ho chuki he
 The Maharashtra government is blaming it for the Chinese-made power spray
 inhen bain bhi kiya ja chukaa he
 But the fact finding report prepared by the agricultural activists and farmer organizations visiting the affected areas is telling a different story
 is report ke mutabik kam se kam chah maamle aise hai jahaan spray ke liye chini nahin gharelu spray pampon kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 In the report, the recent deaths have been blamed by the Maharashtra government for ignoring the safety measures related to pesticides and the failure of governance
 yavatmal jile samet akele vidarbha kshetra main hi 36 se zyada kisaanon or mazdooron kii maut ho chuki he
 The team preparing the report was led by Kavita Kuruganti, an agricultural activist
 unke sanghathan kaa naam aashaa (elliance for sasteneble and holistic agriculture) he
 The team went to Kalamb and Arni blocks of Yavatmal district and went to the homes of dead people with the effects of pesticides and talked to their families
 aarani block main visheshgyon ne paaya ki jitne kitnashkon ke jitne kanistar spray kiye jate hai, usee ke hisaab se bhugtan kiya jaataa he
 When pesticides are sprayed by renting China's power spray, out of the payment of Rs 25 per canister, Rs 15 goes to the sprayer workers and Rs 10 to the owner of the sugar power spray
 kavita kuruganti ne india today tivi ko bataaya, hamane dekha ki kitnashak ko spray karne kaa mehtaanaa anya krishi kaaryon ke samaan hi he
 In many cases, when spraying pesticide sprayers in other fields, they do not even know the quantity to be sprayed and whether it is safe for them or not
 kavita ke mutabik jo majdoor aise krishi kaary karte hai, wo dalit or adivasee pariwaron se hote hai
 In some cases, it has been observed that young laborers are spraying different chemicals continuously for many days
 jahrile asar vaale ek vyakti ke maamle main dekha gaya ki usne ek din main 500 rupye kamaane ke liye lagaataar do-do paaliyon main kaam kiya
 Due to less employment opportunities, agricultural laborers do this by risking their lives to gather maximum wages in two months with pesticide spray
 report bataati he ki yavatmal main kitnashak ke jehar vaali sabhi mauton ke maamle main paisa or vakt bachaane ke liye kitnashkon ke mishranon kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 Farmers told the visiting experts that they had to face many dangers together
 jaise kapaas kii fasal ko hanikaarak kiton se bachaane ke liye spray kiya jaataa he
 At the same time, growth promoters (special chemicals) are also used for making the crop look good
 fect finding timne paaya ki ek maut ke maamle main teen alag alag kitnashkon ke mishran ko spray kiya gaya tha
 In cases with toxic effects, the use of organophosphate, phenylpyrazole, synthetic pyrethroids, carbamates and neo-nicotinoid alone or in a mixture was reported
 kavita kurganti kaa kahana he ki bharat sarkaar ko tatkaal un sabhi kitnashkon ko bain karnaa chahie jinke asar se mauton ke maamle kii baat saamne ai he
 The Maharashtra government should revoke all licenses to sell these pesticides in the state with immediate effect and stop issuing such licenses in future
 fect finding team ne sarkaar se mauton ke maamle main vyapak surveykshan karaane kii maang bhi kii
 It also expressed the need to overcome this problem by preparing a data system for it
 report main jor dekar kaha gaya he ki mauton kaa asli apradhi wo jehar he jise register karne, banane or bechney kii anumati di jaati he
 The report also said that pesticide vendors are guilty of giving wrong advice
 vahiin kitnashak nirmaataa, kitnashak niamak, swasthya or krishi vibhaag ke saath saath rajya or centre sarkaar bhi jimmedaar hai

 There will be hardly any parliamentary seat in the country where there is a direct conflict between caste and development
 aakhir daur main 19 may ko gajipur sansadeey kshetra main hone vaale chunaav ko jatigat sameekaran or vikaas ke bich janamat sangrah kii tarah dekha ja rahaa he
 The SP-BSP alliance has given Afzal Ansari, brother of mafia don Mukhtar Ansari, a ticket from the BSP quota
 2004 main vah sapa(samaajawaadee party) ke tikat par saansad bane the
 The coalition has tried to fit large sections of the district into caste arithmetic, where Muslims, Dalits and Yadavs can be brought together
 
 At the same time, BJP has once again nominated Union Minister and three-time MP IIT Engineer Manoj Sinha as a candidate
 sinha bhoomihaar jati se aate hai
 According to internal estimates of political parties, there are about 55,000 Bhumihar voters in the district, but despite this, Sinha got more than three lakh votes in 2014
 5 saal main sinha ne jatigat sameekaran ko hathiyaar banane kii jagah vikaas ko tarjeeh di
 Sources reveal that the BJP high command also gave Sinha the option of Ballia seat, where his caste has more than 3 lakh voters, but Sinha chose Ghazipur
 bijepi (bhartiya janata party ) sutron kaa kahana he ki sinha ko apane kaam par bharosa he or agar ye voters ko pasand aa gaya to unke aage ke raajnneetik jivan ke liye behatar sanket hoga
 On the other hand, relying on the caste equation, coalition candidate Afzal Ansari often says in election speeches that he had defeated Manoj Sinha by more than two lakh votes in 2004
 chunavi aankada2004 main afjaal ansaari ne sapa ke tikat par muslim yadav sameekaran ke chalate badi jeet hasil kii thi
 Afzal Ansari polled 415687 votes, while Manoj Sinha of BJP got 188910 votes
 bispi(bahujan samaaj party) ke umashankar 185120 vot paakar tisare number par the
 Except BJP, Afzal Ansari has contested assembly and Lok Sabha elections on the ticket of many parties like CPI, Samajwadi Party and BSP
 2014 main afjaal ansaari ne baliya loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladaa or vahaan 163943 vot paakar tisare number par rahe
 In 2014, Manoj Sinha defeated SP candidate Shivakanya Kushwaha by 32,452 votes on a BJP ticket
 sinha ko kul 306929 vot mili the, jabaki mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party ke pratyaashee kailash yadav 2,41,645 vot ke saath tisare paaydaan par the
 The caste-based internal caste data of most political parties shows that there are about 4 lakh Yadavs in Ghazipur and an equal number of Dalits
 muslim aabaadi kareeb dedh lakh he
 Apart from Yadav, the number of voters from other OBC castes is also around three lakhs
 savarna voters main kshatriyon kii sankhya kareeb 2 lakh he jabaki brahman, bhoomihaar ke saath baaki savarna jatiyon kii sankhya kareeb dedh lakh he
 Manoj Sinha comes from Bhumihar caste and there are only 55,000 voters of this caste in Ghazipur parliamentary constituency
 aise main sinha ko acchhee tarah pataa he ki paaramparik jatigat aankadon main wo feet nahin hote hai
 Hence he made development his primary issue after the 2014 victory
 vikaas kaa muddakuch vakt pehle tak gajipur desh ke sabase pichde jilon main shumaar hota tha
 The development of Ghazipur in the last 5 years has started to change the traditional understanding of caste polarization of political parties
 manoj sinha kaa daawa he ki vikaas kaa palada jati par baari padane laga he or iskaa asar vot pattern par bhi padegaa
 In addition to the four-lane highway, several projects such as Railway Bridge, Medical College, Sports Stadium, Mardan Railway Station have been started on the Ganges River in 5 years
 jatigat samikarnon ko dekhen to sapa-basapa gathbandhan ummidavaar afjaal ansaari kaa palada baari he, afjaal ansaari kii chhavi apane mafia don bhai mukhtaar ansaari se bilkul ulat he
 Afzal has also won the parliamentary elections once, so underestimating him can be a big mistake for any party, but if you see the pace of development in a backward district, Manoj Sinha can be liked by the voters
 sabase bada sawaal ye he ki kya barason se jati ke bandhanon main jakadi janata vikaas par muhar lagaaegi? Nurses of government hospitals in Chhattisgarh are on indefinite strike to demand for increase in salary
 hadtaal khatm karaane ko lekar sarkaar ne rajya main esma (ESMA) laga diya he
 However, it is unlikely to end soon
 nurson ke pichley 12 din se anischitkaalinhadtalpar chale jane se sarkari aspataal prashasan or vahaan bhartee marijon kii haalat kharaab ho gai he
 Many patients have been discharged from the hospital, and many were postponed until the operation
 nurson kii kami ke chalate doctoron ne bhi nae marij bhartee karne kam kar die hai
 On the other hand, on the other hand, 10 thousand nurses strike, nurses have announced that the Voskar government will not come under pressure
 bhale hi wo esma lagaae yaa unhen giraftaar karen
 It is worth noting that about 10 thousand nurses of government hospitals have gone on strike to demand job confirmation and increase in salary allowances
 rajyake sabhi sarkari aspataalon ke nurson keehadtalke kaaran marijon ke oparation par sabase zyada asar padaa he
 From district hospitals to Raipur's largest doctor Bhimrao Ambedkar Hospital, patients will have to wait for one and a half to two months for the surgery of the department of orthopedics
 15 din tak ke liye tal rahe oparationahadtaal ko 12 din biit chuke hai
 Hence the condition of all government hospitals is getting worse day by day
 neuro surgery main bhi routine main hone vaale oparation pandrah dinon ke liye taal die gaye hai
 Only emergency operations are being carried out in government hospitals
 iske liye bhi marijon or unke parijanon ko kaaphi mashkkt kerani pad rahi he
 According to doctors, he has postponed all routine operation
 doctoron kii daleel he ki nurson kii anupasthiti ke chalate yah sambhav nahin he ki routine or immergency oparation ek saath kiye jaaen
 So their entire focus is only on emergency
 sarkarhospatalon main nurson kii hadtaal kaa hawala dekar doctor marijon ko lautaa rahe hai
 In most hospitals, in addition to ortho, the surgery date of patients in general surgery, neuro surgery, plastic surgery, ENT, ophthalmology and Gynec has been extended to fifteen-fifteen days
 nurson ke hadtaal par jane se pehle hi doctoron ne saamaanya taur par kai marijon kii surgery fiks kar di thi, lekin ab use taala ja rahaa he
 Doctors are not able to give the new patients a date of recruitment nor do the operation, in view of the investigation of the newly admitted patients
 duusari ore, nurson kii hadtaal khatm karaane ko lekar swasthya vibhaag ke afasar bhi koi khaas pahal nahin kar rahe hai
 However, on Tuesday, BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya had a long discussion at the party headquarters about the striking employees' demands from the office bearers of the organization
 nurson kii hadtaal se oparation hi nahin duusari anya sevaayen bhi prabhavit hui hai
 Patients have to find a nurse to inject and give medicine
 haalanki prashikshu nurson se kaam chalaaya ja rahaa he, lekin yah sab bhi naakaafi sabit ho rahaa he
 Despite the imposition of ESMA in the state, the nurses' strike has not ended nor they have returned to duty
 rajya ke swasthya mantri ajay chandrakar ne hadataali nurson se kaary par laut aane kii apil kii he
 The striking nurses demand that their salary be increased from Rs 2,800 to grade pay to Rs 4,600
 yahi nahin unki naukari bhi pakki kii jaae
 Police are currently activated to make Esma work
 esma lagaae jane or hadtaal ko gaiyr kanoonee ghoshit kiye jane ke baad police ab pradarshnkaree nurson ko apni hiraasat main le sakati he

 insaaf kii maang ke bich sarkaar ne nirbhaya fund banaaya, jisase yon aparaadh or dushkarm peediton kii madad ho sake
 But the sad part is that this fund is not being used properly so far
 halaat aise hai ki maamle main supreme court ko sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaani padi he
 Hearing a public interest litigation, the court has also issued a notice to the Center and the states on Thursday
 nirbhaya fundki 2000 karod rupee kii raashi centre va rajya sarkaron kii ore se kharch kii jaani he
 a bench of Supreme Court Justices PC Pant and Justice DY Chandrachud sought answers from the central government and state governments for not spending the money of the Nirbhaya Fund to help the victims
 court ne sarkaron ko 6 hafte ke andar apana jawaab daayar karne ko kaha he
 'this money is not for the treasury, but for the victims', while hearing a petition on this side, Justice Chandrachud expressed his displeasure, saying,' 2000 crores of Nirbhaya fund is not just for keeping in the government treasury
 is paise ko peediton tak pahunchaana bhi sarkaar kaa kaam he
 Government's duty is not fulfilled only by creating funds
 centre sarkaar or rajya sarkaar is fund kaa upyog jald se jald dushkarm va yon aparaadh kii peedit mahilaon kii madad or punarvaas vagairah par kharch karen
 To disburse this money and spend it on the victims at the right time, the central government created a national scheme
 ''ek jaisaa muaavja kyon nahin diya ja rahaa'court ne maamle main muaavja prakriya par sawaal uthaaya
 The court said, 'if compensation is Rs 50 thousand at some places, compensation is being given up to Rs 10 lakh in some places
 aisi yojana banaijaye, jisamen muaavja raashi ek samaan ho
 The court questioned the working of the central government and said that in 650 districts, the Nirbhaya fund was to be spent as compensation and rehabilitation for the victims of rape and sexual offenses
 lekin nirbhaya fund banaae jane se lekar ab tak sirf 14 jilon main hi peedit mahilaon ko muaavja diya gaya he
 Simultaneous hearing on five petitions is a matter of simultaneous hearing on five different petitions in the Supreme Court regarding sexual abuse, two-finger test, compensation to rape victims, rehabilitation policy and non-spending of 2 thousand crores of Nirbhaya Fund

 isse pehle bhi supreme court in yachikaaon par kai mahatvapurn aadesh jari kar chuki he
 Pending the appeal hearing in the Supreme Court, the special thing is that Nirbhaya became a fast track court after the gangrape, which gave the verdict in a few months
 dilli hai court ne bhi kuch maheenon main apil par faisla suna diya or ab pichley kai maheenon se supreme court main hi is maamle ke doshiyon kii esalapi (apil) lambit he
 Hence, everyone's eyes are on the Supreme Court hearing and decision

 BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra also held a press conference
 sambit ne kaha, 'supreme court kaa faisla araajaktaa ke khilaaf he
 Arvind Kejriwal is celebrating it as a victory but it seems that he has not read the decision properly
 kyonki court ne apane faisle main kaha he ki samvidhan sarvocch he or samvidhan main araajaktaa kaa koi sthaan nahin he
 One has to follow the constitution
 'sambit paatra ne aage kaha, 'jab jaj faisla likh rahe honge to arvind kejariwal kaa cheharaa saamne aayaa hoga
 The court said that the constitution is supreme there is no place for anarchist
 kejariwal khud hi kai baar apane aap ko anarchist ghoshit kar chuke hai
 Kejriwal wants to run the Constitution in his own way
 pradhanmantri ke liye unhone kis tarah ke shabd prayog kiye hai sab jaanate hai
 'he said,' According to the decision of the Supreme Court today, Kejriwal should work for the public
 dilli kii janata se kiye gaye vaadon ko puraa karnaa chahie
 But in the last three and a half years, Kejriwal has found excuses not to work
 ' sambit paatra ne aage kaha ki, agar kejariwal ko kaam nahin karne diya gaya to bade-bade poster or hordings lagaakar kejariwal yah daawa kyon kar rahe hai ki unhone dilli main bahut kaam kiya he?is maamle par bijepi ke anya netaaon ne bhi aap ko gherne main koi kasar nahin chhod rahe hai

 MP Ramesh Bidhuri said that development work has been stalled in Delhi for the last three years, which is the main reason that the government does not make plans according to law, but after today's decision, it is expected that this picture will change
 maamle par saansad mahesh giri ne kaha ki kejariwal sarkaar ke liye yah ek sharmindagi kaa vishay he ki supreme court ne apane nirnay main araajaktaa ko lekar tippanee kii he
 Apart from this, MP Udit Raj said that while implementing the Constitution in 1952 Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar made it clear that Delhi would be a Union Territory due to being the capital of the country but in an attempt to hide its failures, Kejriwal continued to address this issue Picking up
 mudde par vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta ne kaha ki, 'aam aadmi party mananeey sarvocch nyaayalay ke nirnay ko lekar janata ko gumraah karne kii sajeesh rach rahi he
 He said that the court has warned the Aam Aadmi Party that there is no place for anarchy in democracy
 mananeey nyaayalay ne kaha he ki sanvaidhanik simaaon kaa aadar kiya janaa chahie
 The party should learn from this warning
 ''nyaayalay ne yah bhi mana he ki dilli kendra shasit kshetra he or ise purna rajya kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa
 Kejriwal should now stop diverting attention from his failures on this demand
 unhone kaha ki mananeey court kaa nirnay sanvaidhanik or vyakhyaaon ko lekar he

 Apart from this, the demand of full state was also to fulfill this purpose
 parantu aaj supreme court ne nishpaksh nirnay dekar doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani kar diya
 It was discussed in the cabinet meeting today that the door-step ration and CCTV camera files will be cleared
 mananeey sarvacch nyaayalay ke nirnay se in vishyon kaa kuch lenaa dena nahin he
 AAP government's claim is baseless
 rashan kii file 18 march se dilli sarkaar ke paas hi ataki hui he
 The CCTV camera plan is yet to receive approval from the cabinet
 vijendra gupta ne kaha ki, 'mananeey sarvocch nyaayalay ke adeshon se kejariwal sarkaar kii kaaryastylee or shashan par koi prabhaav nahin padhane vaala he
 There was never any kind of ban on working on many subjects like water, electricity, providing civil services in unauthorized colonies, pollution, public transport, but the Kejriwal government did not work for three and a half years to expose its failures
 tried
 ''ab vah khisyaani billi kii tarah khambha nonch rahi he
 The Leader of the Opposition said that the Constitution and the law are paramount
 kejariwal ko samvidhan or niyamon kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 He said that Kejriwal and his ministers want to get the officers to act wrongly
 ve unhen daraate dhamkaate hai or apni manmarjee se kaam karwaanaa chaahate hai
 Now all this should stop
 'unhone kaha ki yadi kejariwal abhi bhi bina vidhi vibhaag, vittiya vibhaag, prashasnic sudhaar, sambandhit vibhaag kii sahmati ke bina koi prastaav cabinet athwa vidhaan sabha ke samaksh laayenge to use sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa

 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ke prati sankalp doharaate hue kaha he ki unke jivan main ‘samaadhaan’ tab tak nahin ho saktaa jab tak ‘ramnagari’ main bhavy mandir kii sthapana nahin ho jaati
 Advani said in a public meeting held in Ayodhya that the then Congress government should have taken initiative to construct the temple in Ayodhya like the Somnath temple
 unhone kaha, ‘mere raajnneetik jivan main tab tak samaadhaan nahin ho saktaa jab tak jis sthaan par bhagwaan ram kii murti sthapit he, vahaan ek bhavy mandir nahin ban jaataa
 i believe that every Ram devotee in the country would like that day to come as soon as possible to build a temple in the place where Ramlala is seated
 ram mandir nirmaan nahin ho jane tak hamaari koshishen jari rahengi
 Advani said that the three judges related to the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court, in their decision, have accepted that the place where Ramlala sits in Ayodhya is the birthplace of Ram
 unhone kaha ki kendra main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali bhaajapanit sarkaar ke kaarykaal main ayodhya vivaad ke teen samaadhaan dikhaai padate the, pehla, kendra main bhaajapa kii sarkaar ho or is baat kaa nirnay sansad se karaayaa jaae
 Second, the court should decide and thirdly, hindu-muslim leaders should sit together and decide
 adwani ne kaha ki hindu muslim baithkar vivaad kaa faisla karen, isse behatar kuch nahin ho saktaa
 Hopefully, the second and third solutions will work together
 bina kisi takaraav or katutaa ke yah kaam hoga
 Ram devotees of the world will see that the Ram temple will be built where their idol is
 vah isi aashaa ke saath yahaan aae hai
 He said that after reading the books 'somnath' and 'pilgrimage to Freedom', he came to know that the same problem arose regarding the construction of the Ram temple, the same problem also arose with the temple of Somnath during the Prime Minister of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 Had happened
 adwani ne kaha, ‘mujhe pataa laga ki akramanakariyon ne somnath kaa jo mandir dhwast kiya tha use phir se banaae jane kaa nirnay kendriya mantrimandal ne kiya tha, jisaki adhyakshata pandit nehru ne kii thi or us baithak main moulana maujuud the

 'he said,' The resolution was passed at a meeting of the Jana Sangh in Himachal Pradesh
 hamaara maananaa tha ki jaisaa ravaiya us vakt pandit nehru ne somnath mandir ke bare main apanaaya tha
 At the same time, the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi should have adopted the case of Ayodhya also
 ’adwani ne kaha ki ram mandir ke liye nikaali gayi rathyatra ne unhen bahut kuch sikhaaya
 He said, 'advani did nothing for Ayodhya
 ayodhya ne mere liye bahut kuch kiya
 Ayodhya taught me cultural nationalism
 kisi bhi vishay par desh ko jaagrath karne ke liye rathyatra se behatar koi rasta nahin ho saktaa
 Advani stressed the need to bring back black money stashed in foreign banks to India and said that the poverty of the country will be eradicated if the government and leaders do not take a bribe nor give it and develop the villages by bringing back the black money
 unhone kaha ki videshi bainkon main mulk kaa 25 lakh karod rupaya rakhaa he

 Counting the failures of the Central Government, he said that due to scams, we have earned so much infamy in the world
 itane ghotaale hue ki mahangaai charam par pahunche gayi
 The Vajpayee government controlled inflation
 adwani ne kaha ki kendra main bhaajapa ke shasankaal main kuccha main bhucamp or pokharan parmaanu pareekshan ke kaaran america pratibandhon ke baavjood mahangaai nahin badhane di
 This situation cannot happen today because the government is not able to stop corruption
