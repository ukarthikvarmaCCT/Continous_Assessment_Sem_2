 *** america raashtrapati baraak obama ne kaha he ki jab tak vah raashtrapati hai tab tak vah iran ko parmaanu hathiyaar nahin lene denge
 In the third and final debate of the presidential election, Obama said this by turning to his rival Mitt Romney
 obama ke mutabik, 'jab tak main america kaa raashtrapati hum tab tak iran ko parmaanu hathiyaar nahin milegaa
 'obama described Israel as' true friend' and 'greatest ally in the region'
 raashtrapati ne kaha, 'yadi isroyal par hamalaa hota he to america isroyal ke saath khadaa rahegaa
 i made it clear during the entire term of my presidency
 'romany ne parmaanu sampann iran ko vishwa ke saamne sabase bada khatra ghoshit kiya jabaki obama ne aatankwaadi network ko sabase bada khatra ghoshit kiya
 Iran has declared its nuclear programs to be of a peaceful nature, while the United States and its Western allies believe it is developing nuclear weapons
 namaskara main raveesh kumaar! sanvaidhanik or loktantric sansthaaon ke sandarbh main aisi ghatnaayen hoti rahani chahie, jisase ham uski vikaas yatra, bhoomika, garima or swatantraaa ko lekar gambhir ho sake or lage ki loktantr main voter hona hi ekmaatr naagarik daayitv nahin he
 Understanding of constitutional institutions should also be a part of our general political consciousness
 ho saktaa he ki aapmen se kai rajyapal kii sanstha kii bare main sochate hi na ho or sochate bhi ho to akhabaaron main chape un simit sandrarbhon main ki rajyapal ne kisi dak tikat kaa vimochan kiya he yaa vaais chancelaron se mulaakaat kii he yaa vidhansabha dwaara paarit kisi bill par dastakhat kar diya he
 There should also be a dispute over who should be made the governor, but today the ruckus is about the way of removal
 aaj jaanate hai ki achaanak se vahi gumnaam parantu vishwasaneey sutara patrakaron se sargoshiyaan karne lage ki kai rajyapalon se kah diya gaya he ki aap istipha de den
 Sources heard the Union Home Secretary calling these governors
 darasal aisi khabaren sutron se hi aati hai
 Whether the year is 1960 or 2014
 pehle braking news ke tahat kai rajyapalon ke istipha dene kii khabar chali
 Then many of them were denied
 uttar pradesh ke rajyapal bi el joshi ke istife kii khabar sahi nikali
 JB Patnaik and Hansraj Bhardwaj denied
 shila dikshit ke bare main khabar udi ki unhone istipha dene se manaa kar diya he, lekin aupchaarik bayaan yahi aayaa ki ai dont no
 But his son Sandeep Dixit was questioned by our colleague Sandeep Phookan that it is reported that the Home Secretary has called several governors for resignation, instead of saying i don't know, Sandeep Dixit says that it is unfortunate
 grih sachiv koun hota he? rajyapal sanvaidhanik pad he
 In my opinion, the Home Minister or the Prime Minister should have called
 koi system hona chahie
 Tomorrow DSP will start calling you to resign
 ab congress se sawaal poochta ki aapane apane samay main kya system banaaya, magar unka koi pravaktaa sho main aane ko raji hi nahin hua
 By the way, BJP leaders are not even formally telling whether it happened or not
 ravishankar prasad se samvaadadaata poochhate rahe magar unhone kaha ki aaj vah iti mantri ke rup main apni praathamikta bataa rahe hai
 But there was also a flash of news that the names of which BJP leaders have come in the Governor's list
 kya bhartiya raajnneeti main sansthaaon ke sawaal ko hameshaa is aadhaar par samajha jayega ki jo congress ne kiya, vahi bijepi ko bhi karnaa chahie
 In this case, the record of everyone from the Janata Party government to the Congress, VP Singh and NDA government is the same
 agar aap samvidhan kii kisi kitaab ke aas paas hai to rajyapal kii niyukti yaa hataane ke sandarbh main artical 153 se lekar artical 156 tak pard sakate hai
 i want to mention here the opinion of the 2010 Supreme Court, which was filed by BJP leader late BP Singhal Saheb opposing the removal of four governors as soon as the UPA government came
 unka kahana tha ki rajyapal ko hataane ke maamle main raashtrapati kaa adhikaar antim or berokatoke nahin hona chahie
 There are many references to the governor in this decision
 - rajyapal raashtrapati kii krupa rahane ke dauraan apane pad par bana rah saktaa he
 - The President may at any time remove the Governor from office without giving reasons or giving an opportunity to give reasons
 - lekin raashtrapati ki is shakti kaa manamaane dhang swechhacharita yaa avivekpurna tareeke se istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 But the Attorney General of the UPA government had said that in a democracy, the political party comes to power by winning elections on the basis of a particular ideology and feels that if the governor is not favorable towards his ideology or policies, then he can remove them
 Should be in supreme court ne is tark ko khaarij kar diya ki rajyapal kaa kaam sarkaar kii nitiyon ko lagu karnaa nahin he
 Rather, in the 2010 judgment, the court traces the origins of the President's Pleasure of President to the essence of which the provision is a product of the feudal period in England
 loktantr main jahaan kanoon kaa raaj chalata he, vahaan krupa kaa siddhant saamanti dhaanche se alag hota he
 There is no place of arbitrariness in democracy
 rameshwar prasad banaam union of india 2006 maamle main supreme court ne kaha tha ki rajyapal ko centre sarkaar se swatantra hona chahie
 In the 2010 judgment, the Supreme Court has also said that the governor is not an employee of the central government, nor an agent of the ruling party
 vah bhale raajnneetik prishthbhumi se aa saktaa he, magar rajyapal banane ke baad uski nishtha samvidhan ke prati hoti he
 It is also dismissible that the Governor can be removed if the Central Government is not confident
 is faisle main sanvaidhanik peeth ne ek amareeki jaj justise homes ke uddhran ko kot kiya he, 'samvidhan ke praavdhaan ganit kaa formula nahin he
 They are organic
 jeevant sansthaaen hai
 We cannot understand its importance by mere word or dictionary, to understand it, one should also look at their origin and development path
 yah bhi hota rahaa he ki koi sibiai ke nideshak pad se ritair hote hi agle maheene rajyapal ban jaataa he
 Removal methods have also been controversial in the past and many decisions of the governors themselves have also been political
 paryaapt aadhikarik or aupchaarik soochnaaon ke abhaav ke baavjood kya ham is sawaal se takaraa sakate hai ki ikkisvin sadi ke loktantr main kya rajyapal kii sanstha ke saath vaise hi bartaav hona chahie, jaisaa beesvin sadi ke aadhe hisse main hota rahaa he
 Should the Governor not explain the reason for his removal? durupyog ke itihaas se sabak lete hue raashtrapati kii krupa ke praavdhaan ko hi hataa dene par vichaar karne kaa saahas kyon nahin dikhaate ham?

 iske alaava vah jald hi varun dhawan or shraddha kapur kii dance aadhaarit street dancer main bhi dikhaai dene vaali hai
 The political battle in Mau district of Purvanchal is Dawn Vs
 yani har koi don se lard rahaa he
 This don is the blood of freedom fighter
 iske dada aazaadee se pehle 1927 main congress ke adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 In this election, everyone is fighting the man who has been behind bars for 12 years
 wo 20 saalon se lagaataar 4 baar mau sadar seat se chunaav jeetta aa rahaa he
 The party does not mean much to him
 ek baar phir wo basapa ke hathi par savaar hokar 5veen baar vidhansabha pahunchane kaa sapana salaakhon ke bheetar se dekh rahaa he
 Yes, we are talking about the grandson of freedom fighter Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari and Don Mokhtar Ansari of Purvanchal
 mokhtar khud jail main hai, lekin wo khud to chunaav lard hi rahe hai, saath hi unke bade bete abbaas bagal kii seat ghosi se basapa ke tikat par maidan main hai
 Not only this, Mokhtar's elder brother Sibgatullah is also contesting as a BSP candidate from Yusufpur Mohammadabad in the neighboring district of Ghazipur
 mokhtar ke bade bete apane chunaav main vyast hai, to bade bhai apane chunaav main
 But the look of Mokhtar's office is same as before
 koi to he jisamen mokhtar samarthak apane mokhtar kii chhavi dekh rahe hai
 Suddenly an 18-20 year old boy enters the office
 dadhi-moonch bhi thik se nahin jami he, lekin lanbaa kad,aankh main chashma, gale main lanbaa safa or baat karne kaa andaaj kaaphi had tak mokhtar jaisaa
 This is Mokhtar Ansari's younger son Omar Ansari
 jo dilli main bibie kii padhai kar rahe hai, lekin pita ke chunaav ko sanbhaalane ke liye aae hai
 However Mokhtar Ansari has been in jail since the 2005 Mau riots
 yani tab 12 saal pehle unke chote bete umr mahaj 7-8 saal ke the
 Now he has taken command of his father Mokhtar
 inkaa andaaj bhi mokhtar jaisaa he, kisi ko ye mahasoos naa ho ki, mokhtar jail main he iskaa wo khaas khyaal rakhte hai, har kisi ko kehete hai ki, chintaa kii koi baat nahin he
 In the conversation with Aaj Tak, when the father is called Bahubali, Don or criminal, he says that this is a name given to a section of media and opponents, in which there is absolutely no truth
 wo kehete hai ki, kshetra kii janata unke pita ko garibon kaa maseehaa maanati he
 Yes you can call him Robin Hood
 wo kehete hai 2007 main bhi pita jail main the, tab bhi nirdaleey jite the, is baar to basapa jaisi party bhi saath he
 Akhilesh Yadav, who stopped the merger of the Qaumi Ekta Dal in SP, is called Omar Bhaiyya
 lekin lage haath apni naaraazgi bhi jaahir karte hai
 According to Omar, during the elections to the Rajya Sabha and the Legislative Council, there was an offer from the SP to join hands with the Qaumi Ekta Dal, Akhilesh himself agreed to it, then later he did not know what to do
 par main akhilesh bhaiya se vahi kahuunga jo mulaayam singh ne kaha ki, jo apane baap kaa naa hua wo aapkaa kya hoga
 As a son, i cannot even think of forcibly taking away his power while a father
 is ilaake main mokhtar 20 saalon se vidhayak hai, lekin rojgaar, bunakaron kii badi aabaadi kii samasyaayein, mil, factory nahin hona logon kii aam samasyaayein hai
 There were two big mills here, which are closing in ruins, then there is the Jal Mahal of the tourism department in the middle of the lake, which is lying closed, eating dust and surrounded by bushes
 vikaas kii aas main hi log hai
 Opponents are making this an issue
 wo kehete hai ki, 2000 or 2005 main jab dange hue tab mokhtar ansaari vidhayak bhi the or jail se baahar bhi
 Then after 2005, he went to jail as an accused in the Krishnanand Rai murder case
 uske baad se dange nahin hue
 But even openly opponents on camera are not ready to speak this thing
 haa, naaraa jarur virdohi lagaate hai ki, takht badal do, taj badal do, 20 saal kaa raaj badal do
 In front of Mokhtar Ansari is Altaf Ansari of SP, a weaver fraternity with a large Muslim population
 wo bataanaa nahin bhoolatey ki, mokhtar ansaari muslimon kii agadi jati se hai, sirf naam ke ansaari hai
 But on the question of calling Mokhtar a don, Bahubali or criminal, Altaf says, i cannot say anything, ask the public whether they are a don, Bahubali or a criminal
 vaise is ilaake main chunaav kaa mudda gum phirakarmokhtar ansarike ird-gird dikhataa he
 On talking to the people, Mokhtar supporters call Mokhtar the messiah of the poor, saying that, on every occasion, his office gets help in every way for years
 to vahiin, virdohi kehete hai ki, mokhtar ke vakt main vikaas nahin hua, wo chunaav ke vakt sirf hindu or musalmaan karke sampradayikta failaate rahe hai
 By the way, in this interesting battle, due to the alliance with BJP, there is also Mahendra Rajbhar, candidate from the election trail stick of Bhartiya Samaj Party, who has hoped that they will get the benefit of the vote-sharing between two Muslims
 lekin yahaan sab bahubali mokhtar ke ird-gird he, isliye haal hi main yahaan raily main piem modi ne apana chunaav nishaan chadi haath main pakade mahendra rajbhar ko katappa qaraar diya or kaha ki, bahubali ko katappa hi haraayega
 Overall, Don is in jail, but in the elections
 isliye yahaan mudda bhi don hi lagata he
 Now it has to be seen whether the ride of Don Kihathi is able to take them to the assembly
 chunaav ayog kii sifarish par raashtrapati dwaara aam aadmi party ke 20 vidhayakon kii sadsyta radd karne ke maamle par dilli ke mukhyamantri or party sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne pehali baar centre sarkaar ko nishane par liya
 Arvind Kejriwal, who came to participate in the program of Saraswati Pujan in the Timarpur Assembly, justified the decision of the Parliamentary Secretary and was seen taking sympathy from the public by giving a rude speech to the Central Government
 arvind kejariwal ne aarope lagaate hue centre sarkaar par ek ke baad ek kai waar kiye
 Kejriwal said that these people are behind us and are not allowing the Delhi government to work
 hamaare kai vidhayakon ke khilaaf jhuthe cese kiye gaye, giraftaar bhi kiya gaya lekin jab maamla court main gaya to sabko chhod diya gaya
 He said that this happened for the first time in the history of India when the Chief Minister's house and office were raided
 dilli sarkaar kii 400 file mangava kar jaanch kii gai taaki kejariwal ke khilaaf kuch mil jaae or kejariwal ko giraftaar karen
 In 4 months, 400 files were investigated by LG but nothing was found against me
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne 20 vidhayakon kii sadsyta radd karne ke faisle ko galat bataaya
 Kejriwal told the forum that people in their own language had a position of profit and said that when they did not go anywhere, then 20 elected mlas were dismissed by the people, which is very wrong
 laabh kaa pad kya hota he main bataata hum
 i told the mlas that apart from their Legislative Assembly, each MLA was given the responsibility of 40 different schools every day
 wo vidhayak skool main jaakar dekhtaa tha ki teacher time par skool aate hai yaa nahin, toilet saaf hai yaa nahin
 The mlas used to report to me daily and get them rectified
 kejariwal ne janata se sawaal poochhate hue kaha ki janata bataae galat karata tha yaa sahi? hamane usko ek bhi paisa nahin diya, ek bhi gaadi nahin di, koi bangala nahin diya or vidhayak apane paise kharch karte the
 During this, Kejriwal was also seen calling his mlas insane
 kejariwal ne kaha ki hamaari party andolan se nikali he
 We have sacrificed everything by going to jail and eating poles
 hamaare saare vidhayak pagal kism ke hai wo khud kaa paisa kharch karte or scooter se kaam pe jate the
 What profit have we made in it? Tell the public what mess i gave by giving different responsibilities to 20 mlas? Does the judge have any fault? Actually the people of the center are behind us because the people in Delhi are with the broom but the central government is not allowing them to work
 centre sarkaar ko gherte hue kejariwal ne chunaavon kaa mudda bhi uthaaya
 Kejriwal said that if elections are held in 20 seats, then the Election Code will be put in place and work will be stopped, then the Lok Sabha elections will come, then the Election Code will be put in place and then the work will be stopped, then the next assembly elections will come and work will stop again 
 centre ke logon ne 2 saal ke liye dilli main kaam thapp kar diya he
 Like the election campaign, Kejriwal also presented the plan for the next 2 years to the public
 unhone kaha ki centre jitna bhi pareshaan kar le main nahin darataa, kyonki janata mere saath he
 It is wrong to do politics on the work of the public and neither should politics with the public
 dilli sarkaar ne planning kii he
 In 2 years, the plan to install CCTV inside Delhi is ready, the plan to provide free wifi is ready
 kachi colony main siver, pani, sadak, naalee kaa kaam puraa ho jayega

In response to this question, Tiger said that i did not take any stand on these pictures because my sister posted that i did not find anything wrong
 bahut se log bahut tarah ke photoshuts karavaate hai or tasviren post karte hai ye uski(behan) apni marji he vah tasviren post karnaa chaahati he yaa nahin

 Tiger Shroff also talked about his deep bonding with sister Krishna

 Perhaps the government will not be able to tell its exact number
 kitne hi bekasoor nashe par niyantran ke naam par jelon main he

 " unhone likhaa he, "nashe ko pradesh main niyantrit karne ke kadam uthaaye jaayen

 " World Hearing Day 2019:aisa kaha jaataa he ki free time main agar mujeec suna jaae to vyakti chintamukt ho jaataa he
 Following this, we spend many hours listening to songs on earphones during the day

 If your score is low then this app also advises you to see an ENT doctor
 vaise bataa den, bharat main kaaphi logon ko sunne main dikkat hoti he, lekin doctoron kaa kahana he ki is samasya ko thik kiya ja saktaa he
 By the way, tests like OAE and BERA are now available, which can help to know the time period of the ears without pain and you can get it treated at the right time
 yearphone kaa zyada istemaal karne se aap in samasyaon ke shikaar ho sakate hai-1

 lekin in yearphone ko aapako apane year canal ke paas main lagaana padhata he, jiske chalate hawa kaa pravaah kaanon main ruk jaataa he
 Due to this, you may suffer from a lot of type ear infections

 Ear numbness - People who use earphones for many hours a day must have had this experience
 jab ham kaaphi lambey samay tak yearphone lagaakar rakhte hai or phir nikaalte hai, iske chalate hamaare kaan sunn pad jate hai
 We don't hear anything clearly for a short time

 dimag par nakaaratmak asar- agar aap jarurat se zyada yearphone prayog kar rahe hai to aapke dimag par bhi iskaa nakaaratmak asar pad saktaa he
 Earphones emit electromagnetic waves, which can also affect the functioning of our brain for a long time

 Facebook is also being used heavily this time for campaigning in Delhi's election riots
 netaaon main zyada se zyada fasebuk likes hasil karne kii hode lagi he
 Even some leaders are not avoiding spending lakhs of rupees to win the Facebook likes race
 dilli kii raajnneeti main in dinon fasebuk war chal rahi he
 Kejriwal 6 on social networking site
 5 lakh like ke saath pehle number par hai to vijay goyal bhi tej raftaar se aage batch rahe hai
 With nearly 4 lakh 80 thousand likes, Vijay Goel is challenging Kejriwal but to win this race, Vijay Goyal has to pay a lot of price
 vijay goyal ko fasebuk kaa har like 5 se 12 rupee main pad rahaa he
 Lakhs of rupees are being spent on Vijay Goel's fast-growing popularity on Vijay Goelfacebook
 ek anumaan ke mutabik vijay goyal fasebuk par like hasil karne ke liye ab tak kam se kam 20 lakh rupee kharch kar chuke hai
 But when Goyal was asked why there was a need to buy likes on Facebook, instead of replying at his expense, he started questioning the leaders of the other party
 lekin fasebuk par to har taraf goyal kaa hi ped prachaar najar aa rahaa he
 The question is that if the leaders are really so famous then what is the need to spend money to get Facebook likes? bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne ram vilaas paswan se kinaaraa kar liya he
 Recently there was a discussion that there will be an alliance between Paswan's party, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Janata Dal United (JDU), but now there is no point in this
 nitish kumaar ne do took kah diya he ki aisa kuch bhi nahin hoga
 According to newspaper reports, he said that i have read about such alliance in newspapers, but till now there has been no discussion on the subject in JDU and LJP
 janata darbar main mukhyamantri se yah sawaal poocha gaya tha
 He informed that there is a compromise between the Jharkhand Vikas Party and his party
 sahi samay par siton ke bantwaare par baatcheet hogi
 About Aam Aadmi Party, he said that any person can form a party
 hamaare samvidhan main isaki aazaadee bhi he
 He also said that the media is now increasing the Aam Aadmi Party, while he was with someone else (bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi) a few days ago

 After a few hours of peace, firing has started again from across the border
 sutron ke mutabik, tangadhaar ke paas fyring main do javaanon ke shahid hone kii khabar he
 Firing is taking place in Samba and Hiranagar sectors
 iske alaava samba main pakistani firing main ek mahila kii maut ho gai or aath log zakhmi hai
 Meanwhile, the Pakistani army has claimed that a 13-year-old girl was killed on her side in the shootout
 sarkaar ne ek adwiseri jari karke seemaa par rahane vaale logon se surakshit jagahon par jane ke liye kaha he
 So far, about one thousand people have been sent to other places from Samba and Hiranagar
 pichhali raat samba ke chor gali ilaake main biguef ne ghuspaith kii ek badi koshish ko naakaam kar diya
 BSF Inspector General Rakesh Sharma said, "pakistani troops opened heavy firing and fired mortar at the outposts and civilian areas along the international border in Samba and Kathua districts from 9:30 am last night
" unhone kaha, biguef ke javaanon ne makul jawaab diya, jisase donon ore se golibari hone lagi jo aaj tadake 3 baje band hui
 Sharma said that from 7 am today, Pakistan again opened fire targeting civilian areas and started firing mortars
 yah ruk-ruk kar jari he
 In view of the firing, people have been instructed to leave from there
 bharat ne bhi pakistani rangers kii firing kaa munhtod jawaab diya he
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh has asked the BSF to give an appropriate response to the shelling
 grahamantri ne kaha he ki pakistan bina uksaave ke firing kar rahaa he
 Significantly, in the latest episode of ceasefire violation started on the eve of New Year, a soldier of the Border Security Force has been martyred
 aaj ek mahila kii maut or nau anya log ghayal hue hai
 As of Friday, five Pakistani Rangers have been killed in India's retaliation
 mahila aarakshan vidheyak par shivasena ne you-turn le liya he
 After backing the Women's Reservation Bill, the Shiv Sena today changed its stand and demanded that the bill not be introduced in the present form in the Lok Sabha
 sena ke varisht netaa or loksabhaa ke purv adhyaksh manohar joshi ne sansad bhawan parisar main samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki shiv sena mahilaon ko 33 fisadi aarakshan dene ke khilaaf nahin he, lekin nirvachan kshetron kaa aarakshan nahin ho
 Instead, it should be made mandatory for parties to give 33 per cent tickets to women
 joshi ne vidheyak main sanshodhan kii maang karte hue kaha, ‘hamaari party spasht kar chuki he ki vah 33 pratishat aarakshan kaa samarthan karti he, lekin yah dalon ko faisla karnaa chahie tathaa nirvachan kshetron ko arakshit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 When asked what the party will do if the government brings the bill in the present form in the Lok Sabha, he said, "when this bill comes in the Lok Sabha, then we will decide our strategy
" party ke ek anya netaa anant geete ne chetavanee di ki loksabhaa main bhi agar ise paarit karaane ke samay marshalon ke jariye bal prayog karaayaa gaya to party iskaa virodh karegi
 He said, 'we will not allow the Bill to be passed in Lok Sabha through marshals and use of force
 ham iskaa kadaa virodh karenge
 Opposing the present form of the bill, Geete said that the government is not particularly keen on the welfare of women
 vah keval iskaa shrey lenaa chaahati he
 How powerful people are using the booths with disabilities is surprising
 kaagajon main alotty ke naam kaa her-pher badi aasaani se kar diya jaataa he or uske baad inhen boothon ke jariye booth mafia apana kaarobaar shuru kar dete hai
 The handicapped comes to despair
 tajjub yah he ki emsidi ne ek hi pate par darjanon dukaane de di hai
 Booth No-1 Alloti- Address of Baburam (handicapped) Allottee- 6759, Gali No-3, Block No-10, Devanagar Karolbagprime This booth is located on the crossing Saraswati Marg of Karol Bagh
 kaagajon main ye baburam ke naam he, lekin ab iskaa malikana haq tarun telvani ke naam par he
 Transfer and mutation are also named after him
 kamaal kii baat yah he ki baburam or tarun telvani kaa pataa bhi ek hi he
 When the team of Delhi Aaj Tak reached the spot, it was seen that there is not a PCO booth here but a juice shop
 jab hamane hakeekat jaanane kii koshish kii to dukaan par baithe shaks ne dukaan ke maalik ke bare main to nahin bataaya, lekin dilli ajtak ke haath aae artiai ke jawaab se khulaasa hua ki tarun telvani darasal vishnu kumaar sindhi ke bete hai
 That is, this shop belongs to Vishnu Kumar Sindhi
 booth number-2alotty-fakira singh (viklang)alotty kaa pataa- 6759, gali number-3, block number-10, devnagar karolabagpata vahi lekin yahaan bhi alotty badal gaya
 To know the reality of this PCO present in the Ghaffar market of Karol Bagh, till today the team reached Delhi, it was found out that Vishnu Kumar Sindhi is the owner and he has been running a juice shop for 25 years
 booth number-3alotty-sheetala prasad (viklang)alotty kaa pataa- 6759, gali number-3, block number-10, devnagar karolbagis pisio booth main bag kii dukaan saji he

 According to the reply received from RTI, the owner of this booth is Bhishnu Kumar Sindhi
 sirf karolbaag jone main hi aise 16 booth hai jinka maalik he vishnu kumaar sindhi he
 In fact, this man is so well mastered that he disappears the records of Alloti and later talks about selling that allotment
 aapane gaur nahin kiya to ham aapako phir bataa den ki in sabhi dukaanon kaa maalik to ek he hi
 Shops are registered at the same address and that address is 6759, street number-3, block number-10, Devnagar Karol Bagh
 tajjub ye ki jis pate par emsidi ne darjanon pisio booth kaa alotment kar diya, us pate par koi alotty nahin rahata
 This is the address of Vishnu Kumar Sidhi, who has been declared a booth mafia by the MCD himself
 is ghotaale ke liye pehali najar main emsidi par bhi anguliyaan uthati hai, lekin kamishnar north emsidi pi
 K
 gupta kehete hai, ‘mujhe jaankaree nahin he, jaanch karaayenge
 According to North MCD Mayor Azad Singh, he is also not aware of this matter and he also said to investigate
 emsidi main vipaksh ke netaa mukesh goyal kehete hai, ’coralbagh main hi nahin puri dilli main he ghapala
 'delhi Aaj Tak talked to so many disabled people, whose shops were taken over by the booth mafia
 adhiktar ne to mafia ke saamne haath khadey kar die
 But some were determined to stand against the mafia
 shaareerik simaaon ke baavjood inke hausale kii koi seemaa na thi
 Encouraged that no one will be fascinated if we get some help from the society
 lekin booth mafia ne inane haq par hi daaka daal diya
 Ram Kumar Rai is one of the ill-fated whose booth was taken over by the booth mafia
 ram kumaar raay ke naam par bhi pisio booth alott hua lekin booth mafia ne kabja kar liya
 But Ram Kumar did not lose courage, he fought a long battle to get the booth and agreed with his right
 ab unhone apane jaise baaki logon ko haq dilaan kii muhim chalaa rakhi he
 Ram Kumar Rai has gathered information under the RTI that Vishnu Kumar Sindhi, in connivance with MCD officials, got 16 PCO booths allotted to his same address
 ye sabhi booth viklangon ke liye the or wo pataa he6759, gali number-3, block number 10 dev nagar
 Ram Kumar Rai These booths are fighting a legal battle to get the rightful occupants

 film kii khaasiyat hoti he kii uske moments aapako ant tak yaad rah jaaen, or kuch aisa hi is film main bhi he, cricket match, naatak main shivaji kii entry, van liners, jaise kai pal yaad rah jate hai
 In the film, Rajkumar has played very well and can be connected to his character, while Hari Tangari has done a great job as his friend, Gulshan Grover has a good character, Shruti Haasan has done well 
 gautam gulati kaa bhi sahaj abhinay he
 Darshan Jariwala makes you laugh a lot and casting other characters is also correct
 film kii khaasiyat ye bhi he kii isamen pressure ke saath jabardastee vaale seen nahin he, lekin aam jindagi se releted fasebuk friend request, doodhwaale kii kahani, or kamedi ke panch bahut achche hankemjor kadiyanfilm kaa sangeet relies se pehle hit nahin ho paaya, uske upar kaam kiya jaataa, to film or bhi dilachasp lagati, saath hi clymex or behatar ho saktaa tha
 The screenplay could have been made even more crisp and interesting
 box offisfilm kaa bajet kaaphi kam he or tite bajet main ise zyada se zyada screens main relies kiya jane vaala he
 The film is going to be hit with 'raabta', due to which people can be inclined towards 'raabta' on most weekends but after weekend the word of mouth can take this film forward
 film kii opening acchhee lagane kii ummid bataai ja rahi he

 The National Commission for Women has opened a front against BJP MLA Surendra Singh, who made a statement in favor of the BJP MLA accused in the Unnao rape case
 rashtriya mahila ayog ne baliya ke bairiya se bijepi vidhayak surendra singh ke khilaaf galat bayaanbaji ko lekar notice jari karne kaa faisla kiya he
 National Commission for Women Rekha Sharma said that MLA Surendra Singh has made objectionable statements about the victim of Unnao gang rape, on which we are going to send notice to them
 unhone kaha ki yah patr (notice) unhen isliye bheja ja rahaa he taaki unnav kii balaatkaar peedita ke bare main unke asamvedansheel bayaan ko lekar vistrut jaankaree mil sake
 What BJP MLA said? Let me tell you that in Unnao rape case, BJP MLA from Bairia Surendra Singh has given a controversial statement in defense of Kuldeep Singh Sengar
 surendra singh ne kaha ki teen bacchon kii maa ke saath koi rape karata he kya? bijepi vidhayak ke is bayaan ke baad ek baar phir upi sarkaar kii kirakiri hui he
 Surendra Singh said that MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar was not present there at the time of the incident
 saath hi unhone rape kii ghatana ko pryojit bataaya or kaha ki manovaigyanik aadhaar par kah saktaa hum ki koi bhi 3-4 bacchon kii maa se dushkarm nahin kar saktaa he
 'this case is not in our jurisdiction', he said, adding that we are also saddened by the reply of the Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh in the matter, in which he put all the responsibility of the arrest to the CBI
 jabaki, wo aaropee ke khilaaf darj exiaar ke baad karrwai kar sakate the
 She said that we cannot take action directly in the case of Kathua and Unnao as the victims are minor in both the cases and according to the National Commission for Women Act, we cannot take the case of minors in our hands
 ye hamaare adhikaar kshetra main nahin aata, balki ensipisiar ke tahat aata he
 Regarding the action on the Kathua case, he said that Article 370 prevents us from doing anything in the case
 yah kanoon jammu-kashmir main lagu nahin he
 Despite this, it is not correct to say that we are silent because of the BJP government in these states
 unhone kaha ki hamane bijepi shasit rajyon main pichley kai maamalon main karrwai kii he
 Please tell that UP DGP OP Singh had said that CBI will decide the arrest of accused MLA Sengar
 idhar,unnav rapakes main aaropee bijepi vidhayak kuldeep singh senger ke khilaaf FIR darj kar lee gai he
 a case has been registered against the accused MLA at Unnao's Makhi police station late Wednesday under sections 363, 366, 376 of IPC and various sections of Poxo law
 iske saath upi sarkaar ne is maamle kii sibiai jaanch kii sifarish bhi kar di he
 The silence of the National Commission for Women amidst a lot of furore over the resurgence of the Women's Commission resigned has surprised the people
 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne kaha kii rashtriya mahila ayog ke adhyaksh or sadasyon ko istipha de dena chahie kyonki itane samvedansheel maamalon main bhi chuppi saadh kar ayog ke log balaatkaariyon ko badhaava de rahe hai
 He questioned that till now the Commission had neither written any letter nor sought any report from anyone
 bijepi vidhayak par balaatkaar kaa aarope he lekin pradhanmantri se lekar modi sarkaar kii tamaam mahila mantri chup hai or yah behad khed kaa vishay he

 gauratlab he ki beete 18 farvari ko dalit kaaryakarta bhanu vankar kii maut ke baad yojit ahmedabad band ke liye dharna dene ja rahe jignesh ko police ne hiraasat main le liya
 At that time there was a heated argument between Jignesh and the police officers, whose video also went viral
 video main jignesh police waalon se kehete najar aa rahe hai ki 'yah aapke baap kii jaagir nahin he'
 Not only this, Jignesh also used the word 'lakhota' for a policeman with a plain uniform in custody
 jignesh ne shuukravaar ko twit kar apnijan ko khatre kii ashankazahir kii he
 While sharing the link of a Gujarati web portal, he has written that two police officers have been caught discussing about my encounter with each other
 vahiin ahmedabad ke SP (rural) kaa kahana he ki unhone kahin se aae massej ko sirf forward kar diya he or unke massej kaa galat matlab nikaala ja rahaa he
 He said that it is neither a personal message nor any threat to anyone
 ikkisvin sadi ke is hitech daur main upi ke hathras ke ek skool se hairaan kar dene vaali tasviir saamne ai he
 The video of how the game of superstition was being played in the temple of education went viral on social media
 video main dekha ja saktaa he ki ‘tantra vidya’ ke jariye ek mahila kaa upachaar kiya ja rahaa he or skool ke kai bachche aasapaas khadey hokar ise dekh rahe hai
 The incident took place at school in a former secondary school in Chandragadhi village of Hathras district
 jila shiksha basic adhikari ne video kaa sangyaan lene ke baad skool ke teacher jaishankar saraswat ko nilambit kar diya he
 It was not clear when the video was from, but it was said by Jaishankar Saraswat that the new school season should start well, so this havan was done
 basic shiksha adhikari ne kii karravaivideo menskool cabaramde main havan hota dikh rahaa he, jahaan shikshak, bachche or gaanv ke log maujuud hai
 At the same time, a woman is swinging out the tongue, which is being treated
 kuch log havan kunda main aahuti dete dikh rahe hai
 There was a panic in the education department as soon as this video went viral
 hathras kii basic shiksha adhikari rekha suman ne skool main is tarah kii gatividhi ko bilkul galat bataaya he
 He also ordered the suspension of school teacher Jaishankar Saraswat
 aaropee shikshak ne di safaiudhar, aaropee shikshak ne apni safai main kaha he ki skool mentantr-mantrajaisa kuch nahin hua tha balki saraswati pujan hua tha
 According to the teacher, the woman whose treatment is being said was not called, she came herself
 use jab chakkar aane lage to use vahaan se uthaa diya gaya tha
 The teacher also says that the Basic Education Officer acted without knowing his favor
 shikshak ne saath hi sawaal kiya ki saraswati pujan hindustan main nahin hoga to kya pakistan main hoga? While giving a statement on Sunday, the newly elected Chief Minister of Karnataka, Kumaraswamy said that he has become the Chief Minister of Karnataka by the grace of the Congress and is not under the pressure of six and a half crore people of the state
 ab is bayaan par safai dete hue unhone kaha ki unka matlab logon kaa anadar karnaa nahin tha
 Rather, it was to emphasize that it depends on the will of the ally, how long he will remain the Chief Minister
 dilli main pradhanmantri narendra modi or sheersh congress netaaon se mulaakaat karne vaale kumaraswami ne kaha ki vah krishi rin maafee ko lekar patibaddh hai, anyathaa raajnneeti se sanyas le lenge
 He appealed people not to get involved in the conspiracy of the SEBP
 kumaraswami ne kaha, ‘main mukhyamantri hum, jis par rajya ke saadhe chah karod logon kii jimmedaari he
 i am on the grace of Congress, i meant that i am in the position of Chief Minister as long as his support is with me
 saath hi kisi bhi kaarykram ko chalaane ke liye mujhe unke samarthan kii aavashyaktaa hogi or maine aisa hi kaha he
 Kumaraswamy's old statement, Kumaraswamy said, "my party has not formed a government alone
 maine logon se aisa janadesh maanga tha ki mujhe unke alaava kisi or ke dabaav main nahin aane de
 But i am at the grace of Congress today
 main rajya ke saadhe chah karod logon ke dabaav main nahin hum
 Kumaraswamy said, "people of the state rejected me and my party
 maine purna bahumat dene kaa aagrah kiya tha
 i also heard the statements of farmer leaders and how much support they gave me
 ’ kumaraswami ne kaha ki netaa ke taur par unki bhi kuch majaburiyaan he
 Despite this, he said that his stand on agricultural debt waiver is quite clear
 bataa den ki karnataka main haar ke baad sattadhari congress ne tisare number kii party jedies ko samarthan dene ke saath-saath kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri banane kaa faisla kiya tha

 Now Bigg Boss ex contestant Priya Malik is also going to be included in this list
 lekin isse pehle unhone ek badi gocip kaa khulaasa karte hue kaha he ki hina or arshi salmaan ko bilkul pasand nahin karte hai
 In a recent interview, Priya Malik revealed the big gossip going on inside the house
 unka maananaa he ki arshi or hina bhaijan ko khaas pasand nahin karti hai
 He said that Salman gives opinions to every contestant about his performance and image in the show
 hina ko bhi salmaan ne ghar se baahar ban rahi unki chhavi ke bare main samajhane kii koshish kii thi
 But Hina did not listen to Salman before him and did not understand the gesture of Bhaijaan
 salmaan ne kyon kaha- big bos main unka aakhri sijan, dhinchik puja hai vajah!hina kii hi tarah arshi ko bhi har hafte salmaan kii daant kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 But Arshi calls them sorry in front of Salman and assures them not to do such a thing from further
 lekin thodi der baad phir se vah apane man kii karne lagati hai
 From this analysis of Priya Malik, it seems that Salman's opinion does not matter to these families

 aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki desh ko pehla auskar acting yaa diarection ke liye nahin balki costum digining ke liye mila tha
 The 1983 Oscar Awards were very special for India
 iske peeche vajah ye thi ki pehali baar ek mahila ne desh ke liye auskar jeeta tha, jiskaa naam tha bhanu athaiya
 Costume designer Bhanu Athaiya was born on April 28, 1929
 aaj vah 90 saal kii ho gai hai
 His full name is Bhanumati Annasaheb Rajopadhyay
 bhanu ko bachapan se hi drawing kaa shauk tha
 Bhanu designed the costume for the international film 'gandhi' and his work was appreciated worldwide
 richard atonbaro kii yah film gandhi or unke kaamon par aadhaarit thi
 Bhanu's full name is Bhanumati Annasaheb Rajopadhyay
 unka janm maharashtra ke kolhapur main hua
 She was the third of her seven sisters
 bhanu ke pita kaa naam annasaheb tha or vah printing kaa kaam karte the
 Bhanu's father passed away when she was just 9 years old
 pita kaa kaam kala se judaa tha or bhanu kaa kala ke kshetra main rujhaan shuru se tha
 Bhanu started education in art from his childhood
 kala ke ek adhyaaapak unhen padhaane ke liye ghar aayaa karte the
 Later after finishing his schooling, he took Sir J
 of Mumbai
 je
 Enrolled in School of Art
 yahaan se unhone fine art main snakat kii padhai puri kii or gold medal jeeta
 Bhanu has also served as a fashion illustrator in several women's magazines
 fasebuk samet tamaam soshal media plateforms par ek post kii kaaphi halchal najar aa rahi he, jisamen fasebuk yugers ko apane acount delit karne ke liye kaha ja rahaa he
 Even the co-founder of the popular messaging site whatsapp has suggested to his followers on Twitter to remove their account from Facebook
 darasal, america ke raashtrapati chunaav main donald trump kii madad karne vaali ek form ‘cambridge analitica’ par lagbhag 5 karod fasebuk yugers kii nijee jaankaree churaane ke aarope lage hai
 This information has been used to spoil the image of the opponent and support in winning the trump during elections
 ise fasebuk ke itihaas kaa sabase bada datalikakaha ja rahaa he
 These data were easily obtained by Cambridge Analytica (CA) using an application developed by another company, Global Science Research (GSR)
 saal 2014 main jiesar ne ek persenality quij ap 'disaijayoradigitalalife' shuru kiya, ise kuch 'manovaigyanikon' dwaara kiye jane vaala prayog bataaya gaya
 The application, which surfaced through Facebook, was downloaded by 2,70,000 people
 downlod karne vaale graahakon kaa fasebuk data sie ke paas pahunch gaya
 This application was actually completely against Facebook's developer policy
 lekin fasebuk ne ise roka nahin or iske dwaara logon kii data churaane or use dusron ko bechney kaa silsilaa jari rahaa
 In this way, with the download of only 2,70,000 people, CA gained access to their entire friendlist and got information about about 5 crore users without their permission
 lekin mudda keval fasebuk kaa nahin he
 Because not only Facebook has access to your personal information, but the apps that you login through Facebook on your smartphone also get your personal information
 in eps ko apane fasebuk kaa acces dena khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 Personal information blown out of Facebook has also questioned the election results
 sanyog se bharat kaa naam un deshon main shaamil he, jahaan fasebuk ke sabase zyada yugers hai
 In such a situation, if you do not want to delete your Facebook account and also want to keep your account safe, then you can take these precautions
 1
 Location Access If you do not want your personal information to reach others, then first stop your location access
 kyonki aapaki yatra or daure se sambandhit jaankariyaan fasebuk acces ke jariye third party eps dwaara istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Due to your location data, Facebook is always aware of your location
 aise main agar aapane aise eps downlod kiya he jo fasebukaafika upyog karte hai to third party eps aise data kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Location Permissions can be turned off by going to Facebook Settings
 2
 Remove suspicious apps using the Facebook API Many of us inadvertently give third party apps access to their Facebook data
 jaise cambridge analitica ne apane ap 'disaijayoradigitalalife' ke jariye fasebuk se nijee jaankariyaan chura lee
 There are many apps that steal personal information
 aise main yadi aap jaananaa chaahate hai ki koun se eps aapaki jaankariyaan chura rahe hai to desktop par fasebuk open kar settings main jaaen
 On the left side you will see Apps
 yahaan jaakar aap un eps kii list dekh sakate hai jinhen aapke fasebuk data kaa acces he
 From here, apps can also be deleted as per your wish

 Sharing settingsfacebook provides settings through which you can choose the audience for your post
 is feechar ke madhyam se purv main kiye gaye post kii pahunch bhi simit kar sakate hai
 Similarly, mobile number and other information can also be set, including friend request

 4
 vyaktigat jaankariyaan saajha karne se bachenfesbuk ke 'about me' section main apni kam se kam jaankariyaan saajha karnaa hi thik samajha ja saktaa he

 Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh and Union Minister of State (independent Charge) Jyotiraditya Scindia were called by Congress President Sonia Gandhi at 10 Janpath
 haad compati thand main sonia ne siyaasi ubaal laate hue digvijay se kaha, ‘‘madhya pradesh main shivaraj ko chunauti deni he, to ek cheharaa dena hi hoga
 You have to support Scindia
 ’’ darasal, yah congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii taiyaar script thi, jise ve sitambar 2012 se hi taiyaar kar rahe the
 But he put it on with Sonia
 usee saal aktubar main rahul ne sindhiya ko pramot kar pratikatmak ‘‘power’’ yani urja mantralay kii kaman saunpi jiske baad congress adhyaksh ke rajnatik sachiv ahamed patel ne aage kii baatcheet kii kaman sanbhali
 It took Rahul a year to materialize his plan
 lekin is yojana ne bijepi ko apni ranneeti badalane par majaboor kar diya to rahul kii haank ne sabhi congressi kshatrapon ko ek manch par laa khadaa kiya
 The compulsion of the Congress to push Scindia forward in the Congress was the report on Chauhan's growing personal support base
 uske mutabik, bijepi ke mantriyon-vidhayakon ke khilaaf gussa hone ke baavjood har vidhansabha seat par chouhan kaa apana 4 fisadi vot bank bananaa tha
 The Congress lacked a single face to prevent Narendra Modi from a big win in Gujarat, so Rahul decided to take on the Shivraj government instead of giving a walkover in Madhya Pradesh
 usee kaa nateeja he ki uma bharti banaam digvijay singh kii 2003 kii ladaai ke baad pehali baar bijepi-congress main vyaktitv kaa takaraav hone ja rahaa he
 This time, in front of Chauhan, Scindia is the chef of the royal family
 pradesh kii raajnneeti main rajavaadon ke varchasv kaa itihaas rahaa he
 The Mahakaushal, Raghogarh, Scindia kingdom and the Judeo family, along with the small princely states governed politics throughout Madhya Pradesh
 rajavaade ab rahe nahin par ilaake main shahi parivaar kaa prabhaav or rutaba ab bhi kaayam he
 The Congress has also been energized by bringing out Scindia, a youthful and immaculate image
 ek dashak baad pehali baar madhya pradesh main congress gambhirtha se chunaav maidan main utari he
 a ceremony was scheduled in 2001 to politically launch the double-barreled gunjyotiraditya Scindia
 par usee saal madhavrao sindhiya kii helicopter haadase main maut ho gai
 When Madhavrao, who is more busy in politics, was not able to give time to private institutions and the work was getting affected, one of his close and family members for 40 years, Dr
 keshav pandey ne unhen salaah di ki un sansthaaon kii jimmaa yuvaraj ko kyon nahin saunp dete? is par madhavrao kaa jawaab tha, ‘‘meraa betaa dabl bairal kii bandook he
 He knows how to handle things in a professional manner
 ’’ darasal, dabl bairal kii tippanee garv mahasoos kar rahe ek baap kii thi, jiskaa betaa dabl emb kar chukaa tha
 Being emotional, Jyotiraditya describes his father's untimely demise as the biggest turning point in life
 maharaj kii chhavi rakhane or isi naam se pukaare jane vaale sindhiya behad saadhaaran libaas pahananaa pasand karte hai or apni gaadi main kabhi airkandishnar nahin chalaate
 But whenever Scindia is fond of food, whenever Gwalior comes to his palace, before that his food menu reaches the cooks by fax
 maharashtrin daal unhen behad pasand he
 They are also fond of "fish wine" and know that aiming at the eyes of the fish is not the goal
 prashasan main timwork ko ahm maanakar chalane vaale sindhiya swabhaav se ziddee hai or kuch karne kii thaan lene par use puraa kiye bina chaun nahin lete
 Despite the disdain of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, he does not try to push aside those half-dozen satraps of the Congress
 gwalior-chambal sambhag main 17 aktubar kii vishaal jansabha main jab digvijiya ne bhaashan dene se inkaar kar diya to sindhiya ne unhen bolne ke liye manaa liya taaki congress kii ekajutata par sawaal na uthe
 Digvijay said, "I never give a speech in front of Soniaji and Rahulji, but today i have to bow down to Balhat (scindia's insistence)
 ’’ unki is tippanee par maharaj ne apane hi rajavaade main manch se haath jodakar manasabadaar (digvijay) kaa muskaraakar dhanyavad gyaapit karne main hichak nahin dikhaai
 Scindia's biggest strength is Rahul
 par 2ji ghotaale main fanse e
 Not being able to point fingers at Raja despite being a minister in the same department with Raja shows his superior administrative ability
 congress kii ranneeti saaf chhavi vaale shivaraj ke mukaable aise hi netaa ko utaarne kii thi
 The speech art of both is the same
 sindhiya ke bijepi par aarope lagane par jab taaliyaan bajati hai to ve mike kaa munh janata kii taraf kar dete hai
 If Shivraj collects applause by telling his plans to communicate directly, Scindia makes a flurry of allegations and asks the public for answers
 unke siyaasi kaushal kaa sandesh bhi ab neeche tak pahunchane laga he
 "if Madhavraoji was Maharaj, Jyotiraditya is a master of politics," says Mohkam Singh, an 87-year-old elder from Bhind at the Gwalior rally
 ’’ wild life photography ke shaukeen sindhiya ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ve bal kii khaal nikaalkar hi koi aglaa kadam uthaate hai
 There is excitement in gwalior-chambal division with Scindia being made a face
 haalanki iske baavjood zyaadaatar log maanate hai ki elaan main bahut deree ho chuki he
 Scindia, who hails from Harvard and Cambridge, perfectly follows the family's customs
 subah 8 baje uthne ke baad vyaayaam or puja-paath unki dincharya kaa hissaa he
 Touching the mother's feet both times is still her habit
 maheene main ausatan 10 se 12 din ve daure par rahete hai to maheene main do din sansadeey kshetra main bitaate hai
 BJP has started looking a little harder since Chauhan has been handed the command of Modi to Aarasindhia
 vaise to pichley saal hi sindhiya ko saamne laane kii khabaren udaye par bijepi ko shubahaa ho gaya tha ki der-saver yah hoga
 BJP strategists believe that young and especially first-time voters may be attracted to Scindia's personality
 lekin isaki kaat ke liye bijepi ab narendra modi ko rajya main saghan prachaar ke liye utaaregi
 Due to this move, fearing the wrong message among the minority voters, Chauhan was not in favor of making Modi the PM candidate till the assembly elections
 modi kaa rajya main daura bhi simit mana ja rahaa tha
 But now a BJP leader says, "scindia cannot be more crazier than Modi among the youth
" sindhiya ke prati aakarshith hone vaale vot ko rokane ke liye ham modi kii yuvaaon main isi apil kaa sahaara lenge
 The BJP has also made a strategy to pay less attention to Scindia in political attacks
 haalanki uske rashtriya mahasachiv (sanghathan) raamalaal kehete hai, ‘‘sindhiya ke aane se koi fark nahin padaa he
 Our slogan is what Narendra Modi has said that Congress should have a free India
 ’’ haalanki kai jagah bijepi ne ‘‘aage-aage shivaraj, peeche-peeche maharajya’’ kaa naaraa diya he
 But Ramlal does not consider it an official slogan
 bijepi ab rahul gandhi kii raily se pehle vigyapanon main puch rahi haih pradesh aagaman par shahjade se kuch sawaal
 In this, answers are being sought by raising the question of absconding Anderson accused of Bhopal gas scandal, land scam on Robert Vadra, insulting Prime Minister Manan Mohan Singh, corruption, inflation, Nirbhaya rape and plight of National Highway
 shivaraj kaa ‘‘indira’’ stylapichley 2-3 maheenon main sindhiya ke saath sabhi congress netaaon kii ekajutata or satta parivartan reliyon main umadi bheed ne bijepi kii hetric kii raah ko kathin banaaya he
 In such a situation, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has started targeting Indira Gandhi in 1971 in his speeches and targeting the entire Congress
 gwalior kii rahul kii raily se pehle chouhan apni jan aashirwad yatra par katni main the
 Chauhan's speeches refer to the achievement of his rule, the plan for the next five years and the corruption of the central government to step-motherly behavior
 congress kii ore se ghoshnavir siem hone ke aaropon kaa jawaab chouhan kuch is tarah de rahe hai, ‘‘ghoshnaa kaayar nahin, vir hi karte hai
 "rahul-scindia takes pride in giving speech, rights to food, information, education, employment to the general public, then Chauhan explains how he bought all the grain from farmers, gave bonus and then Rs
 1
 kilo genhu diya
 They also ask the question, what did Congress give? On the solidarity of Congress leaders, he says, "congress leaders who did not look at each other with a teary eye, are now shaking hands
" satta main aane ke liye vyakul ho rahe hai
 "in election meetings, Chauhan is creating an emotional wave like Indira Gandhi," i say remove poverty, he says remove Shivraj
 main kahata hum pani lao, wo kehete hai shivaraj hataao
 
 
 The Chief Minister repeats this slogan by counting the names of all his schemes
 janata ke liye hi jeene or jarurat padane par marane kaa bhi vaada karte hai
 bjp's weak link Shivraj Singh Chauhan government's biggest problem is his ministers and mlas, so he himself is the specialty
 chouhan kii lokapriyata badi he, lekin kareeb darjan bhar mantriyon par aadhe se zyada vidhayakon ke khilaaf janata main rosh he
 Describing Chauhan as the captain of a completely corrupt government, Scindia says, "if 6,000 of the 7,000 announcements are in cold storage, how can the captain of the boat escape responsibility?" jo captain ladli lakshmi abhiyaan kare or madhya pradesh balaatkaar kii rajdhani ban jaae to kaise kah sakate hai ki siem kii jimmedaari nahin
 The captain under whom all the corruption is rampant
 khud siem par danpar cond main aarope he
 Why did only Sudhir Sharma and Dilip Suryavanshi get all the government contracts in the state? ”however, Shivraj has understood his weakness and has left the entire Daromdar to the state president and his most trusted colleague Narendra Singh Tomar
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bhi tomars-shivaraj kii jodi thi
 The BJP is trying to employ all the leaders by giving responsibility so that dissatisfaction does not remain
 sanghathan ko or chaak-chauband rakhane ke liye boothon kii nigaraanee ke liye ab mandal kii bajaae gram / shahar centre banaae gaye hai or har centre main 4-5 booth he
 This is trying to improve surveillance
 tomars har seat par party ke varisht netaaon se anaupchaarik charchaa kar chuke hai
 But the party has not even set up an election committee in view of the revolt
 halaat ko dekhte hue alaakaman ne bhi sab kuch shivaraj-tomars par chhod diya he
 Both these leaders want to cut the tickets of 60 percent of mlas, including many ministers, on the lines of Gujarat, but are unable to muster courage
 iske alaava rajya main kuposhan, shishu mrityu dar jaisi samasya shivaraj kii vikaas kii tasviir par daag chhod rahi he
 Rahul policy will lead to the victory of Central India? Congress' electoral theme for Madhya Pradesh may be "this time everyone will say, Congress will come to government", but Rahul's policy for organization is unity of all leaders
 rahul ne sindhiya ko khaas nirdesh de rakhaa he ki hafte main do baar sabhi varisht netaa ek saath baithenge, taaki matbhed khatm hon
 In order to mobilize the organization, special preparations have been made to attack the BJP at the state level along with visits, assembly wise review
 congress ne gelevaar bijepi vidhayakon kii ore se kiye gaye vaade or us par hue amal kii padtaal kii he
 Only those issues are being raised at the local level
 mudde ke taur par bhrashtachar, kuposhan, lokayukta ke chaape main chaparasi tak ke ghar se mil rahe karodon rupye ahm honge
 Mohan Prakash says, "we don't work by looking at the bjp's strategy
 ab ham apni ranneeti par bijepi ko ghumaayenge
 There is excitement in the Congress by indirectly making Scindia the CM candidate, but the party took a long time in deciding
 jis samay unke naam kaa elaan hua, us vakt tak shivaraj apni jan aashirwad yatra main logon kaa vishwaas jeet rahe the
 The BJP knows that the Congress organization is weak
 2003 main jab bijepi ne digvijay sarkaar ko satta se bedakhal kiya tha to usase pehle sadakon par ladaai ladi thi
 Shivraj's image is associated with the entire state and public, while Scindia's image is monarchy
 haalanki bijepi ne unki is chhavi par chot karne kii koshish kii to unhone jawaab diya, ‘‘main 21veen sadi ke bharat kaa ek noujvaan hum
 
 
 a person cannot grow on the basis of the past
 bijepi kaa kaam aalochana karnaa he
 i wonder that they are criticizing the same family of which my grandmother (vijayaraje Scindia) was one of the founders of that party
 jab meri buaa (vasundhara raaje) ko rajasthan main mukhyamantri banaaya to ye sab shabd yaad nahin aae, jo ab yaad aa rahe hai
 "scindia also understands the need to change the image, but his supporters are not able to do it at all even if they want to
 madhya bharat main sindhiya ko kaman saunpkar congress ne is baar yahaan chunaav ko rochak bana diya he
 It is now to see whether Scindia is able to establish herself as a hero in this political drama

 In fact, the Aam Aadmi Party had already made it clear that if the Mayor does not resign, his councilors will not allow the House to run, and so as soon as the Leader of the House Jayendra Dabas started reading the budget speech, the Aam Aadmi Party councilors started an uproar And started demanding the resignation of Mayor Preity Aggarwal
 duusari taraf bijepi parshadon ne mantri satyendra jain par lage aaropon par kejariwal hai-hai ke naare lagane shuru kar die
 Apart from these two, the Congress shouted slogans against Mayor Preity Agarwal and Satyendar Jain, accusing both BJP and Aam Aadmi Party of corruption

 input language a post shared by Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) on Jul 18, 2018 at 2:15am PDT There are some questions which are being continuously raised on social media in the case of killing Pradyuman, studying in second class at Ryan International School, Gurgaon
 ye aise sawaal hai jo abhi tak rahasy bane hue hai
 On the basis of this, questions are being raised on the working style of the police
 soshal media par uth rahe sawaalon kii fehrist saamne aate hi jaahir he, shaq hona lajimi he
 Actually, these 8 questions are questioning the manner of investigation of the police: 1- Is the conductor being made a vanguard to save the real culprit? The reasoning behind this question is that to save a powerful person For the school bus conductor Ashok has been made a pawn
 ye baat pradhyumna ke parijan bhi doharaa chuke hai
 He suspects that his child may have seen something that he was killed to hide
 ashok ke kaboolname ko vah fareb bataa rahe hai
 If the family believes that Ashoka may have been forced to confess the crime
 2- agar ashok hi kaatil he to uski shart par khun ke nishaan kyon nahin mili?ghatana kii jaankaree milte hi ashok hi pradhyumna ko toilet se baahar lekar aayaa tha or skool staff ke saath milakar use aspataal lekar gaya tha
 Despite this, why were there no marks of blood on his shirt? If Assuming that Ashok had murdered Pradyuman, then how did his shirt remain immaculate? 3- Why was the toilet cleaned? After the incident, the toilet (where the murder took place) was cleaned
 kya skool management or police ne saboot mitaane ke liye us jagah ko saaf karavaaya? is baat ko lekar bhi police ke role par sawaal uth rahe hai
 4- What was the cleaning done to eradicate the evidence? After the incident, who cleaned the bags of water, the water bottle, and why? 5
 Why was the knife used in the murder cleaned? How is the knife used in the murder cleaned from the spot? met? Was it cleaned to eliminate fingerprints? In fact, Ashok had confessed that the knife was placed in the tool box of the bus
 aakhir vah kis makasad se tul box main rakhaa chaaku toilet lekar gaya tha
 It is not going down anyone's throat that Ashok went there with the intention of killing, because in the confession he has denied any such intention
 6- kisi ne kyon nahin suni pradhyumna kii cheekh?ek aisa skool, jahaan saikadon kii taadaad main bacchon kii chahalkadami hoti ho
 Class room, teachers room and toilet
 
 Be all around
 har minute teachers, bachche toilet kaa istemaal karte ho
 Nobody there heard the shouts of innocent during the murder, how can it be possible? 7- How suddenly the cctvs went bad? The question is also very shocking that the cctvs in the school suddenly got spoiled
 kya asal gunahagaar ko bachaane ke liye aisa kiya gaya he? vahiin aaropee ashok ke kaboolname ke baad bhi police dwaara court main uski remand kii arji daayar karnaa, kaaphi chaunkaane vaala he
 8- Was Pradyumna tried to commit misdeeds? Accused Ashok confessed that he had tried to misbehave innocently
 jab vah chillane laga to pole khulne ke dar se usne uske gale par chaaku se waar kar diya
 Police say they have evidence to this effect
 philhal isaki pushti ke liye pradhyumna ke kapade forencik jaanch ke liye bheje gaye hai

 The whole country is waiting for the execution of the four accused in the Nirbhaya incident, Mukesh, Pawan, Akshay and Vinay
 adaalat ne is maamle ko lekar chaaron gunaahagaaron ke saath-saath tihaad jail ke diji ko bhi talab kiya he
 The only issue is why there is a delay in hanging and when? The court is yet to decide on the execution, but in the meantime, the Superintendent of Tihar Jail has written a letter to DG Jail of UP requesting him to arrange two executioners and send it to Tihar on immediate notice
 patr main jin do jallaad kaa naam he unamem se ek pawan jallaad
 21 November 2012, Yadavada Jail, Pune Azad was the first time in India when someone was hanged without a professional executioner
 mumbai hamale ke gunahagaar ajmal kasaab ko faansee pune kii yadavada jail main faansee dene ke liye faansee ke takhte kaa liver jail ke ek karmchaaree ne hi khinchaa tha
 9 February 2013, Tihar Jail, Delhi was the first time in the history of Tihar Jail when someone without execution was hanged
 sansad hamale ke gunahagaar afzal guru ko faansee dene ke liye faansee ke takhte kaa liver tihaad jail ke hi ek karmchaaree ne khinchaa tha
 On July 30, 2015, Yakub Memon, the perpetrator of the Mumbai serial blasts of Central Jail, Nagpur 1993, was hanged in Nagpur Central Jail
 nagpur central jail main bhi pehali baar tha, jab faansee dene ke liye kisi peshewar jallaad kii jarurat nahin padi
 Rather, the jail staff itself pulled the liver
 bina jallaad ke di gai teen faansidesh main hui ye teen aakhri faansee kii daastaan ye bataati he ki ab faansee dene ke liye jallaad kii jarurat nahin he
 Any prison staff can do this work easily
 haalanki bagaiyr jallaad kii di jane vaali in teenon faansee main ek baat samaan thi
 And that the three criminals who were hanged were involved in terrorist cases
 to kya sirf isliye in teenon kii faansee jail staff ne hi di? kyonki in teenon ko faansee se pehle hui chauthi faansee kii kahani alag he
 14 August 2004, Alipore Central Jail, Kolkata Dhananjay Chatterjee was hanged in Alipore Central Jail in connection with the rape of a minor schoolgirl
 tab wo faansee ek jallaad ne di thi
 His name was Jallad Nata Malik
 pandrah saal pehle hui ye faansee kisi jallaad ke haathon di jane vaali aakhri faansee thi
 Since then, no executioner's help was taken in the last three executions
 tihaad jail prashasan ne upi se maange jallaadato ab pandrah saal baad jallaad kii jarurat kyon aa padi he? ye sawaal isliye uthaa he kyonki upi se ek khabar ai he
 The news is that the Superintendent of Tihar has written a letter to DG Jail in Uttar Pradesh
 9 disambar ko likhe is khat main uttar pradesh se jallaad maanga gaya he
 Now the question is why did Tihar seek executioner from UP itself? So let me tell you that only two professional executioners are alive in the country at this time
 or ye donon hi upi se hai or baqayada upi sarkaar ke liye rettenrship par kaam karte hai
 Now only 2 are present in UP
 The two hangmen of Jalladhyup are currently on the retainership of the UP government, one of them is named Pawan Kumar while the other is named Ilyas alias Ali
 upi police ke sutron ke mutabik tihaad se jo patr aayaa he usamen baqayada inhen do jallaadon ke naam likhe hai
 Apart from these two, there is currently no professional executioner in the country
 isse pehle desh main jitani bhi faansee hui wo pawan ke dada kaalu jallaad, pita maamu jallaad, punjab ke fakira jallaad yaa phir kolkata ke nata jallaad ne di
 But none of these are alive now
 pehali baar akele faansee degaa pawan jalladamerut ke pawan jallaad kii agar baat karen to pawan ne akele aaj tak koi faansee nahin di he
 He has earlier hanged anyone with either his grandfather Kalu Jallad or father Mamu Jallad
 agar nirbhaya ke gunahagaaron ko faansee dene ke liye pawan ko bulaayaa jaataa he to ye pehali baar hoga jab wo akele faansee degaa
 Pawan is ready for this
 uskaa kahana he ki nirbhaya ke gunaahagaaron ko faansee dene main use khushi hogi
 2 hangers to hang four people, however, according to the letter of the Superintendent of Tihar Jail, they have asked for two executioners from UP
 isaki vajah ye he ki tihaad main pehali baar aisa hoga, jab ek saath chaar logon ko faansee di jaaegi
 In such a situation, only two people will be needed to tighten the noose and pull the liver
 par kya pawan or eliyas aisa kar paaenge?chaar faansee kaa pehla tajurbapawan jallaad ko faansee dene ke liye tihaad jail ke suprintendet ne bulaayaa he
 Pawan hangman says that he will be very happy to hang Nirbhaya's culprits
 haalanki pawan jallaad ne apni jidagi main ek saath do faansee to dekhi hai
 If he gets this chance, this will be his first experience of hanging four people together
 pawan jallaad kii maane to faansee dene ke liye use sirf do din kii taiyaari kii jarurat hoti he
 In which it is especially important to check the rope and hanging frames

 When the embassy opened in Jerusalem, Trump called it a 'great day for Israel' in his morning tweet
 unhone subah ke is twit main hinsa kaa koi zikr nahin kiya, lekin kaha, 'isroyal ke liye ek mahaan din'
 a high-level US delegation attended the embassy opening ceremony in which US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, Finance Minister Steven Munchin, Senior Advisor and Trump's son-in-law, Jard Kushner, Senior Advisor and Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and International Dialogue Affairs Special Representative Jason
 Greenblatt included

 ye haalat tab he ki jab bijepi kii ore se party adhyaksh amit shah or khud pradhanmantri narendra modi rajya main apni reliyaan kar chuke hai
 Due to the Congress being on the backfoot like this, perhaps PM Modi said in his election meeting yesterday that the Congress has left the field in this election and due to which they are not enjoying the election
 gauratlab he ki himachal kaa chunavi itihaas bataata he ki yahaan ek baar congress to ek baar bijepi vijayi rahati he

 Is it auspicious or inauspicious
 shani ek raashi main dhai varsh tak rahete hai
 According to transit, the influence of Saturn on the second and twelfth zodiac from the zodiac sign in which Saturn is situated is called half-century
 janm kundali main jis raashi main chandramaa hota he, us raashi se chaturth or ashtum bhav main shani kaa gochar dhaiya kehalaata he
 Which zodiac signs will have the effect of Saturn's Dhaya and Sarathasati in 2019? Saturn's Dhaiya and Sarathasati always give auspicious or inauspicious results based on our deeds, because Saturn has been considered a factor of karma
 varsh 2019 main shani kii sadhesati vrishchik, dhanu or makar raashi vaale logon par rahegi
 To avoid its side effects, do remedy of Shani
 varsh 2019 main shani kii dhaiya vrishabh or kanya raashi vaale logon par rahegi
 These people must also do some measures to make Shani auspicious
 shani ko saral upaay se kaise thik karen?- shani ko thik karne ke liye sabase pehle apane aacharan ko thik karen
 - Respect your parents for getting auspicious results of Shani
 - apane ghar kii pashchim disha ko hameshaa saaf-suthra rakhen
