 Then why do these colleges go on? teen saal lagaakar polytechnic karaane kaa kya matlab he
 Why is the entrance test taken for this
 dhai lakh chaatr farm bharte hai or 9000 ke kareeb seat he
 The people of Bihar are not honest with their own youth, nor are the youth honest to themselves
 kya kaha jaae, vahi baat he ki naujavaanon kii polytical quality unki degree se bhi badtar he
 By writing this, the youth should hang it in their room that i have said

 yah bhi ki niyuktiyon main paardarshita honi chahie jo nahin ho rahi he
 These teachers are questioning the appointments made in the Faculty of Law and the Department of Education
 inkaa kahana he ki niyukti ke liye ujisi ne jo formula banaaya he use chhodkar sab kuch chayan samiti kii marji par chhod diya gaya he

 The University of Delhi only seems to shine in June and July when the middle class is cheated by the newspapers that this is the best university in India for more than 95 per cent of its children
 edaha shikshakon kii kahani bataa rahi he ki ham sab ek azaad mulk main system kii kisi kisi ghulaami kar rahe hai
 i am now beginning to understand why such issues come up on TV or in the media everyday, which are not issues at all
 in shikshakon ke saath jo ninsaphi ho rahi he uskaa samaadhaan mujhe nazar nahin aata
 Universities are doomed
 kahin bhi yogya shikshakon ke liye jagah nahin bachi he
 Think, what college is waiting for the children for whom you pay millions in the name of a good school, what you don't bear, when they get out of school

 The first excuse given that the qualification for the Forest Guard has been expanded
 krishi vigyaan ke alaava arts kamrs ke chaatr bhi is pariksha main baith sakenge
 The age limit for the guard was increased from 24 years to 42 years
 sidhaa dabl
 The maximum age in railways has been reduced from 30 years to 28 years and here it has been increased from 24 years to 42 years

 Mansera said that students have spent 30-30 thousand rupees on its coaching
 yahi nahin, uttarakhand van vikaas nigam ke 191 padon ke liye 31 disambar 2016 ko aavedan aae
 Thousands of students filled the form by giving 500 rupees
 paper li ho gaya abhi tak paper nahin hua he
 2016 to 2018 has arrived
 dinesh mansera kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ke paas vetan dene ke liye paise kii tangi he

 All examinations will now be conducted by the West Bengal Public Service Commission, whose work is very slow

 You will know what is reality and what is slogan

 You may feel that i am doing a job series in a joke, but after picking up all the episodes and read them one line, you will see the cruel face of the system
 ab aap zaraa dhyaan se is timeline ko padhie
 An examination has gone missing in India
 pariksha dene vaale chaatr dharne par hai magar pariksha kaa kahin ata pataa nahin he
 There is a Bermuda triangle of ruining the youth in which no one knows how many soldiers have disappeared forever
 7 janvari 2010 ko bihar sarkaar ne bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog kaha ki 2030 junior ejeeniyar kii bhartee kii prakriya aarambh kii jaae
 a year and a half later, on 8 June 2011, the advertisement of recruitment shows that the marks of the written examination will be reinstated from the merit list
 iske 15 maheene baad 30 sitambar 2012 ko patna shahar ke vibhinn kendron par pariksha lee jaati he
 Think that in January 2010, the state of Bihar feels the need for 2030 Junior Engineers, till 30 September 2012 only the examination takes place
 deree se hui bhartee par rajya kii pragati par kya asar padaa, naujavaanon kii barbaadi kaise hui, iskaa koi soshal audit hamaare paas nahin he
 Two and a half years after the advertisement is released, the written examination gets mired in controversies
 840 ummidavaaron ko chori se uttar pustika bharwate hue pakadaa jaataa he
 The matter reaches the court and comes the order of the High Court that the case will go on, first draw the Bihar Staff Selection Commission Result
 7 may 2014 ko jab rigelt nikalataa he to un 840 ummidavaaron kaa bhi naam merit list main aata he jo chori karte pakade gaye the or jinke khilaaf police ne cese darj kiya tha
 The case then reaches Hoi Court
 ab yahaan se main apni kahani thodi choti karata hum
 a project is being run to cheat our own citizens and make India a world guru, which is a megaproject in its own right
 cese chalata he, jaanch hoti he or june 2016 main hoicourt puraa riselt hi radd kar detaa he
 2010 to 2016 arrived
 2030 junior ejeeniyar chune jane kii aas main naujavaanon kii zindagi ke chah saal khatm ho jate hai
 Then the date of this examination comes out
 tay hota he ki 7 agast 2016 ko bhojpur ke anek kendron par pariksha hogi
 Notice comes on 4 August 2016 that there will be no examination on 7 August
 ab nai taarikh yah nikalati he ki pariksha 18 sitambar 2016 ko hogi
 Question papers of second shift and first shift are distributed in the first shift
 saare sawaal ulat pulat ho gaye to hangaamaa hua, maamla pahunchaa phir hai court main
 On February 2, 2017, the order of Patna High Court comes that there will be a fresh examination
 janvari 2010 se ham kahaan aa gaye, 2 farvari 2017
 Till now an examination of 2030 Junior Engineers has not been conducted
 31 janvari 2018 tak is pariksha kaa kuch ata pataa nahin chalata he
 Now a new order has come that the next examination will be held in the first week of February 2018 or March
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki hamen in muddon par charchaa kerani chahie
 Without all these questions, how incomplete and hollow our understanding of any system is
 13 series main maine kuch anubhav praapt kiya he
 Can't say with the claim but i am seeing a similar pattern in every state
 pariksha chayan ayog yani sarkaar ke system ke kaaran asafal hoti he, barbaad noujvaan hote hai
 Such news is usually printed in newspapers in some corner
 in naujavaanon kii raajnneetik samaj par tippanee nahin kar saktaa kyonki main jaanata nahin
 But i can guess that somewhere they too would be divided into Hindu or Muslim grooves
 varna jis rajya ke ejineering kalejo main paryaapt shikshak na hon, bina padhe ladke paas hote hon, har saal 10,000 junior ejeeniyar kii degree lekar paas hote hon, uske naujavaanon kii polytical quality bahut karaab he
 If it were not bad then it would not have been easy for anyone to ignore these issues
 bihar ke polytechnic kalege shikshak viheen hai
 There are no teachers
 phir ye kalege chalate kyon hai
 What does it mean to have a polytechnic after three years? iske liye pravesh pariksha kyon lee jaati he
 Two and a half million students fill the form and there are close to 9000 seats
 bihar ke log apane hi naujavaanon ke prati eemaandaar nahin hai, na noujvaan apane prati eemaandaar hai
 What to say, it is the same thing that the political quality of the youth is worse than their degree
 ye baat likhakar naujavaanon ko apane kamare main taang dena chahie ki maine kaha he
 Delhi University Teachers Association Duta organized a big march on 6 February
 badi sankhya main pahunche ye shikshak edaha or temporary padhaa rahe shikshakon ko regular karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 Also that there should be transparency in appointments which is not happening
 ye shikshak faikalti of lau or department of ajukeshan main hui niyuktiyon ko lekar sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 They say that everything has been left to the will of the selection committee except the formula made by the UGC for appointment
 inkaa kahana he ki faikalti of lau main july agast 2017 main 126 padon ke liye intervyuu hua
 The result is yet to come, but even before the envelope opens, the list of lecturer professors selected from the university started circulating from 27 January
 is suchi main pehle se padhaa rahe 84 edaha shikshakon main se aadhe se adhik baahar kar die gaye the
 Against this, Duta took a big front that all those who have been teaching Adhak for 5 years and maximum 15 years on average should be hired on permanent jobs
 badi sankhya main permanent shikshakon ne edaha shikshakon kaa saath diya he
 Everyone's life is at stake
 hamane uniwarsity siries kii, kisi ko koi fark nahin padaa
 Everyone has become so confident in Hindu Muslims that there is no longer any status of a citizen
 yah kahani dardanaak he
 Thousands of Adhak teachers have been teaching Adhak at Delhi University for many years
 faikalti of laa main aath saal se edaha padhaa rahi ek lekturer ne bataaya ki aath saal main unhone 15 baar intervyuu diya
 15 times he was hired by the Faculty of LA to teach but was turned out when it came to Permanente
 shikshakon kii bahaali kii paardarshee prakriya na pehle thi na ab he
 Never will, i can give it in writing also
 raajnneetik siforeeshon ke hisaab se bahaaliyaan ho rahi hai
 You cannot change it, yes you can lecture on talent and transparency
 sochie 84 edaha padhaa rahe the unamem se 44 baahar kar die gaye
 What a shock the students must have felt when they saw their good teacher going out like this
 dilli vishvavidhyalay sirf june or july main chamakta lagata he jab akhabaaron ke zarie middle class ko dhokhaa diya jaataa he ki 95 fisadi se adhik laane vaale bacchon ke liye bharat kaa yah shreshth vishvavidhyalay yaheen hai
 The story of Adhak teachers is telling how we all are slaving the system in an independent country
 main ab yah samajhane laga hum ki kyon tivi par yaa media main aise mudde har rose aate hai jo mudde hi nahin hote hai
 i do not see the solution to the injustice that is happening with these teachers
 uniwarsity barbaad hai
 There is no place for qualified teachers anywhere
 aap sochie, aap jin bacchon ke liye achche skool ke naam par lakhon kii fees dete hai, kya-kya nahin sehate hai, jab ve skool se baahar niklenge to unke liye kaisaa college intazaar kar rahaa he
 Never argue over this, the society has discussed a film for three months, you do not know what injustice has been done to the future of your children
 ab ham baat karenge uttarakhand ke foresti guard ke 1218 padon kii bhartee kii
 Dinesh Mansara has told that on 23 September 2017, more than 25,000 applications are received
 iske liye chaatro se 300 rupee liye jate hai
 Now the government has banned this recruitment
 pehla bahaanaa yah diya ki foresti guard ke liye yogyata kaa vistaar kiya gaya he
 Apart from agricultural science, students of Arts Commerce will also be able to sit in this exam
 yahaan guard ke liye umr seemaa 24 saal se 42 saal kar di gai
 Straight double
 railway main adhiktam umr 30 saal se ghataakar 28 saal kar di gai he or yahaan 24 saal se badhaakar 42 saal
 This miracle can happen only and only because in this country only the same topic will run and run
 mansera ne bataaya ki isaki koching par chaatr 30-30 hazaar rupye bhi karch kar chuke hai
 Not only this, applications came on 31 December 2016 for 191 posts of Uttarakhand Forest Development Corporation
 500 rupee farm dekar hazaron chaatro ne farm bhare
 Paper leaked yet the paper is not leaked
 2016 se 2018 aa gaya he
 Dinesh Mansera says that the government is strapped with money to pay salaries
 haal hi vetan dene ke liye 500 karod kaa karz liya
 Dinesh spoke to State Finance Excise Minister Prakash Pant
 bengal ke naujavaanon se kaha he ki dhiraj rakhen, unka number aayega
 If you think that just mentioning will do your work, then your understanding is neither of the system nor of democracy nor of your civic duties
 main samajhataa hum aap naujavaanon kii umr abhi kachi he
 You are now in the lurch pashchim bengal ke chaatr mangalvaar ko west bengal sarvice kamishan pahunche the ye pataa karne ke liye ki unke atake rigelt kab tak atakaey rahenge
 Recently the West Bengal Service Commission has been merged with the Best Bengal Public Service Commission
 kuch vidyo or tasviir chaatro ne hi bheji hai
 Therefore, apart from giving lecture, i am reading a letter from you
 angrezi main bheja he, hindi main suna rahaa hum
 Respected Ravish Sir, ham log pashchim bengal ke asahaay naukari khoji hai
 We have sat in many exams conducted by the West Bengal government, the main ones being LDC / LDA (lower Divisional Clerk / Lower Divisional Assistant), KPS (agricultural Advancement Assistant, Farming Technology Helper), WBSSC (west Bengal School Service Commission such as Teacher recruitment exam whose process started in 2012)
 apper primary teacher ricrotment exam kaa rigelt sitambar 2016 main aa gaya tha lekin intervyuu ke liye ham ab tak intjaar hi kar rahe hai
 Especially the LDC / LDA and KPS exam which was taken by the West Bengal Staff Selection Commission in 2015
 ab pashchim bengal kii sarkaar ne chayan ayog ko hi bhang kar diya he
 The result of the second part of this examination is still awaited
 sabhi parikshaayen ab west bengal public sarvice kamishan yojit karegi jiske kaam karne kii gati bahut dhimi he
 We do not even have an annual calendar here
 bahut si choti bahaaliyaan jaise ki panchayat karyaalay main jila parishad karyaalay main ho rahi hai lekin unamem bhrashtachar adhik he or deree bhi
 No media shows our condition and need
 isliye aapse aagrah he ki yahaan kii naukariyon kaa data dekhe or is par khabar dikhaaen
 The comments aapkaa dhanyavad West Bengal helpless job seeker hamaari naukari kii series se aap bharat ko dekhie
 Look at his arrangement
 aapako pataa chalegaa ki hakeekat kya he or slogan kya he
 You go to the house of the youngsters preparing for the railway examination, just reducing the maximum age from 30 to 28 is sadness on the face of so many youth
 unki taiyaari ke teen chaar saal hawa main ud gaye hai
 You meet those UP personnel who were waiting for a job in the police service for clerical, computer service, but the Police Recruitment and Promotion Board canceled the examination
 ham channelon par chaahe jitani khushhaal tasviren dikhaa len, hakeekat ye he ki noujvaan udhaas hai
 Even though they have no other way but to fry the pakoras
 udhaas haathon se tale gaye pakora kaa swaad feekaa rah jayega
 Sometimes salt will be more, sometimes oil and sometimes pungency
 aapako lag saktaa he ki naukari series mazaaq main kar rahaa hum magar aap saare episod uthaakar ek ek line pard jaaiye aapako system kaa krur cheharaa nazar aayega
 Where have we been since January 2010, 2 February 2017
 abhi tak 2030 junior ejeeniyar kii ek pariksha tak yojit nahin ho saki he
 As of 31 January 2018, there is no sign of this examination
 ab nayaa aadesh aayaa he ki agali pariksha farvari 2018 yaa march ke pratham saptaah main hogi
 Don't you think we should discuss these issues
 in sab sawaalon ke bagair kisi bhi vyavastha kii hamaari samaj kitni adhuri or khokhli he
 In the 13 series i have gained some experience
 daawey ke saath to nahin kah saktaa magar har rajya main isi tarah kaa pattern dekh rahaa hum
 The exam is unsuccessful due to the selection commission i
e
 the system of government, the ruined youth are there
 aisi khabaren aam taur par akhbaaron main kisi kone main chhap di jaati hai
 i cannot comment on the political understanding of these youth because i do not know
 par ges kar saktaa hum ki kahin ye bhi hindu muslim yaa jati ke khaanche main bante hote honge
 Otherwise, in a state where there are not enough teachers in engineering colleges, boys who are uneducated, pass 10,000 junior engineer degrees every year, the political quality of its youth is very poor
 agar karaab na hoti to kisi ke liye aasaan nahin hota in muddon ko nazarandaaz kar dena
 The Polytechnic College of Bihar is devoid of teachers
 teacher nahin hai
 Then why do these colleges go on? teen saal lagaakar polytechnic karaane kaa kya matlab he
 Why is the entrance test taken for this
 dhai lakh chaatr farm bharte hai or 9000 ke kareeb seat he
 The people of Bihar are not honest with their own youth, nor are the youth honest to themselves
 kya kaha jaae, vahi baat he ki naujavaanon kii polytical quality unki degree se bhi badtar he
 By writing this, the youth should hang it in their room that i have said
 dilli vishvavidhyalay shikshak sangh duuta ne 6 farvari ko bada march nikaala

 Can't say with the claim but i am seeing a similar pattern in every state
 pariksha chayan ayog yani sarkaar ke system ke kaaran asafal hoti he, barbaad noujvaan hote hai
 Such news is usually printed in newspapers in some corner
 in naujavaanon kii raajnneetik samaj par tippanee nahin kar saktaa kyonki main jaanata nahin
 But i can guess that somewhere they too would be divided into Hindu or Muslim grooves
 varna jis rajya ke ejineering kalejo main paryaapt shikshak na hon, bina padhe ladke paas hote hon, har saal 10,000 junior ejeeniyar kii degree lekar paas hote hon, uske naujavaanon kii polytical quality bahut karaab he
 If it were not bad then it would not have been easy for anyone to ignore these issues
 bihar ke polytechnic kalege shikshak viheen hai
 There are no teachers
 phir ye kalege chalate kyon hai
 What does it mean to have a polytechnic after three years? iske liye pravesh pariksha kyon lee jaati he
 Two and a half million students fill the form and there are close to 9000 seats
 bihar ke log apane hi naujavaanon ke prati eemaandaar nahin hai, na noujvaan apane prati eemaandaar hai
 What to say, it is the same thing that the political quality of the youth is worse than their degree
 ye baat likhakar naujavaanon ko apane kamare main taang dena chahie ki maine kaha he
 Delhi University Teachers Association Duta organized a big march on 6 February
 badi sankhya main pahunche ye shikshak edaha or temporary padhaa rahe shikshakon ko regular karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 Also that there should be transparency in appointments which is not happening
 ye shikshak faikalti of lau or department of ajukeshan main hui niyuktiyon ko lekar sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 They say that everything has been left to the will of the selection committee except the formula made by the UGC for appointment
 inkaa kahana he ki faikalti of lau main july agast 2017 main 126 padon ke liye intervyuu hua
 The result is yet to come, but even before the envelope opens, the list of lecturer professors selected from the university started circulating from 27 January
 is suchi main pehle se padhaa rahe 84 edaha shikshakon main se aadhe se adhik baahar kar die gaye the
 Against this, Duta took a big front that all those who have been teaching Adhak for 5 years and maximum 15 years on average should be hired on permanent jobs
 badi sankhya main permanent shikshakon ne edaha shikshakon kaa saath diya he
 Everyone's life is at stake
 hamane uniwarsity siries kii, kisi ko koi fark nahin padaa
 Everyone has become so confident in Hindu Muslims that there is no longer any status of a citizen
 yah kahani dardanaak he
 Thousands of Adhak teachers have been teaching Adhak at Delhi University for many years
 faikalti of laa main aath saal se edaha padhaa rahi ek lekturer ne bataaya ki aath saal main unhone 15 baar intervyuu diya
 15 times he was hired by the Faculty of LA to teach but was turned out when it came to Permanente
 shikshakon kii bahaali kii paardarshee prakriya na pehle thi na ab he
 Never will, i can give it in writing also
 raajnneetik siforeeshon ke hisaab se bahaaliyaan ho rahi hai
 You cannot change it, yes you can lecture on talent and transparency
 sochie 84 edaha padhaa rahe the unamem se 44 baahar kar die gaye
 What a shock the students must have felt when they saw their good teacher going out like this
 dilli vishvavidhyalay sirf june or july main chamakta lagata he jab akhabaaron ke zarie middle class ko dhokhaa diya jaataa he ki 95 fisadi se adhik laane vaale bacchon ke liye bharat kaa yah shreshth vishvavidhyalay yaheen hai
 The story of Adhak teachers is telling how we all are slaving the system in an independent country
 main ab yah samajhane laga hum ki kyon tivi par yaa media main aise mudde har rose aate hai jo mudde hi nahin hote hai
 i do not see the solution to the injustice that is happening with these teachers
 uniwarsity barbaad hai
 There is no place for qualified teachers anywhere
 aap sochie, aap jin bacchon ke liye achche skool ke naam par lakhon kii fees dete hai, kya-kya nahin sehate hai, jab ve skool se baahar niklenge to unke liye kaisaa college intazaar kar rahaa he
 Never argue over this, the society has discussed a film for three months, you do not know what injustice has been done to the future of your children
 ab ham baat karenge uttarakhand ke foresti guard ke 1218 padon kii bhartee kii
 Dinesh Mansara has told that on 23 September 2017, more than 25,000 applications are received
 iske liye chaatro se 300 rupee liye jate hai
 Now the government has banned this recruitment

 Apart from agricultural science, students of Arts Commerce will also be able to sit in this exam
 yahaan guard ke liye umr seemaa 24 saal se 42 saal kar di gai
 Straight double
 railway main adhiktam umr 30 saal se ghataakar 28 saal kar di gai he or yahaan 24 saal se badhaakar 42 saal
 This miracle can happen only and only because in this country only the same topic will run and run
 mansera ne bataaya ki isaki koching par chaatr 30-30 hazaar rupye bhi karch kar chuke hai
 Not only this, applications came on 31 December 2016 for 191 posts of Uttarakhand Forest Development Corporation
 500 rupee farm dekar hazaron chaatro ne farm bhare

 2016 se 2018 aa gaya he
 Dinesh Mansera says that the government is strapped with money to pay salaries
 haal hi vetan dene ke liye 500 karod kaa karz liya
 Dinesh spoke to State Finance Excise Minister Prakash Pant
 bengal ke naujavaanon se kaha he ki dhiraj rakhen, unka number aayega

 The result of the second part of this examination is still awaited

 We do not even have an annual calendar here

 You go to the house of the youngsters preparing for the railway examination, just reducing the maximum age from 30 to 28 is sadness on the face of so many youth

 You meet those UP personnel who were waiting for a job in the police service for clerical, computer service, but the Police Recruitment and Promotion Board canceled the examination

 This story is painful
 dilli vishvavidhyalay main hazaron kii sankhya main edaha shikshak kai saal se edaha padhaa rahe hai
 a lecturer in the Faculty of LA, who has been teaching Adhaq for eight years, said that he gave 15 interviews in eight years
 15 baar unhen faikalti of laa ne padhaane ke liye rakhaa lekin jab permanent rakhane kii baari ai to unhen baahar kar diya gaya
 The transparent process of reinstatement of teachers was not there before or it is now
 na kabhi hogi, ye bhi likhakar de saktaa hum
 Restorations are taking place according to political recommendations
 ise aap nahin badal sakate hai, haa pratibha or paardarshita par lacture de sakate hai
 Think 84 were teaching Isaac 44 out of them
 chaatro par kitna sadma pahunchataa hoga jab ve apane achche shikshak ko yun baahar jate dekhte honge
 The University of Delhi only seems to shine in June and July when the middle class is cheated by the newspapers that this is the best university in India for more than 95 per cent of its children
 edaha shikshakon kii kahani bataa rahi he ki ham sab ek azaad mulk main system kii kisi kisi ghulaami kar rahe hai
 i am now beginning to understand why such issues come up on TV or in the media everyday, which are not issues at all
 in shikshakon ke saath jo ninsaphi ho rahi he uskaa samaadhaan mujhe nazar nahin aata
 Universities are doomed
 kahin bhi yogya shikshakon ke liye jagah nahin bachi he
 Think, what college is waiting for the children for whom you pay millions in the name of a good school, what you don't bear, when they get out of school
 kabhi is par bhi bahes kar lijie, samaaj ne teen maheene tak ek film par charchaa kii he, aapako pataa nahin ki apane bacchon ke bhavishya ke saath kya ninsaphi kii he sabane
 Now we will talk about recruited 1218 posts of Forest Guard of Uttarakhand
 dinesh mansera ne bataaya he ki 23 sitambar 2017 ko 25,000 se zyaada aavedan aate hai
 300 rupees are charged from the students for this
 ab sarkaar ne is bhartee par roak laga di he
 The first excuse given that the qualification for the Forest Guard has been expanded
 krishi vigyaan ke alaava arts kamrs ke chaatr bhi is pariksha main baith sakenge
 The age limit for the guard was increased from 24 years to 42 years
 sidhaa dabl
 The maximum age in railways has been reduced from 30 years to 28 years and here it has been increased from 24 years to 42 years
 yah chamatkaar sirf or sirf isliye ho saktaa he ki is desh main vahi vaala taapic hi chalegaa or chalata he
 Mansera said that students have spent 30-30 thousand rupees on its coaching
 yahi nahin, uttarakhand van vikaas nigam ke 191 padon ke liye 31 disambar 2016 ko aavedan aae
 Thousands of students filled the form by giving 500 rupees
 paper li ho gaya abhi tak paper nahin hua he
 2016 to 2018 has arrived
 dinesh mansera kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ke paas vetan dene ke liye paise kii tangi he
 Recently took a loan of 500 crores for giving salary
 dinesh ne rajya ke vitt aabkaari mantri prakaash pant se baat kii
 Have told the youth of Bengal that be patient, their number will come
 agar aapako lagata he ki sirf zikr kar dene se aapkaa kaam ho jayega to aapaki samaj na to system kii he na hi loktantr kii na hi aapke naagarik kartavyon kii
 i understand you youngsters are still raw
 aap is vakt besahaara maare maare phir rahe hai
 Students of West Bengal reached the West Bengal Service Commission on Tuesday to find out how long their stuck results would continue to be stuck
 haal hi main west bengal sarvice kamishan ko best bengal public sarvice kamishan main mila diya gaya he
 Some videos and pictures have been sent by the students

 The result of the Upper Primary Teacher Recruitment Exam came in September 2016 but we are still waiting for the interview

 is pariksha ke duusare bhaag ke rigelt kaa ab tak intjaar kiya ja rahaa he
 All examinations will now be conducted by the West Bengal Public Service Commission, whose work is very slow

 Therefore, you are requested to look at the data of jobs here and show the news on it

 aap upi ke un javaanon se miliye jinhone police seva main lipic, computer seva ke liye naukari aane kaa intazaar kar rahe the magar police bhartee or pronnati board ne imtahaan hi radd kar diya
 Regardless of the happy pictures we show on the channels, the reality is that the youth are depressed
 bhale hi unke paas pakora talane ke alaava koi rasta nahin bachaa he
 The taste of fried pakoras with sad hands will fade
 kabhi namak zyaada ho jayega kabhi tel to kabhi tikhaapan
 You may feel that i am doing a job series in a joke, but after picking up all the episodes and read them one line, you will see the cruel face of the system

 Uber and Ola created a separate identity a few years ago by providing cab services within minutes
 yahi vajah he ki in companiyon kii growth rate main bhi ijapha ho rahaa tha
 But in the last 6 months, the growth rates of Ola and Uber have slowed down
 yahi nahin, in donon companiyon ke customers ko pehle ke mukaable zyada dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 According to the Economics Times report, the daily ridership of Ola and Uber has increased by only 4 per cent in the last six months
 pehle daily rides 35 lakh tha jo ab kareeb 36
 5 lakhs
 iske alaava yatriyon kii pareshaani main bhi ijapha hua he
 According to the report, customers had to wait only 2 to 4 minutes for a cab till two years ago, now they have to wait an average of 12-15 minutes
 iske saath hi bade shaharon main non-peak aavars main kiraye bhi 15-20 fisadi bad gaye hai
 Why the number of cabs decreased? According to the report, the number of cabs has decreased due to a decrease in drivers' incentives
 darasal, pichley ek varsh main driver incentive lagbhag 40 fisadi kam hue hai
 This is the reason why the pace of growth has slowed down
 is kami kii vajah se yatriyon ko samay par cab uplabdh karaane main bhi dikkatein ho rahi hai
 Another indication of the slowing of the business of Ola and Uber is from commercial vehicle registration
 udhaaharan ke liye, maharashtra main 2017-18 main ola or ubar india ke liye kaary karne vaali 66 hajaar 683 tourist cab registerd hui thi, lekin yah sankhya 2018-19 main ghatakar 24 hajaar 386 par aa gai
 Let us know that for the US company Uber, India is included in the selected market with high growth, but due to increasing losses worldwide, the company is in a difficult situation

 Apart from this, your car can also be sealed
 iske baad aapako apane vaahan ko chhudaane ke liye or jurmaana bharne ke liye court ke chakkar lagane padenge

 com / kvyqgu2yc8 — DCP Ahmedabad Zone 5 (@akshaydcp) December 16, 2018 Tractor chopped Rs
 59 thousand Challan Since the implementation of the Motor Vehicle Act, the traffic police is continuously cutting huge challans
 kai baar police vaahan kii keemat se zyada kaa chaalaan thama rahi he
 One such case has surfaced of a scooty, whose challan of 23 thousand rupees was deducted, while the price of scooty is being told 15 thousand rupees
 iske alaava ek tractor kaa 59 hajaar rupee kaa chaalaan kaata gaya or ek auto vaale par 32 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya gaya
 The arrival of Chinese President Xi Jinping on September 17 in Ahmedabad triggered a colorful reception
 raat main khaane par lajij chini vyanjanon kaa swaad lene ke baad thodi-bahut jo guftgu hui usamen pradhanmantri narendra modi ne chupchaap ladakh ke chumaar ilaake main vaastavik niyantran rekha par ghuspaith kii khabaron kaa zikr ched diya
 He strictly told President Xi that such events happen just before the visits of big leaders is not good for mutual relations
 baad main raat ko modi ne apane sahyogiyon se bhi kah diya ki unki raay main aise maamalon main do-took baat karnaa thik rahata he or agle din aadhikarik vaarta main bhi ve yahi karne vaale hai
 He did this as well
 us raat to shi ne zyada kuch nahin kaha lekin 18 sitambar ko jab modi ne yah mudda phir uthaaya to china ke raashtrapati ne kah diya ki ve bharat kii chintaaon ko samajhate hai or china in muddon ke prati jaagruk he
 The President also indicated that China has taken steps that could gradually reduce tensions
 modi aisi ghatnaon ke chal rahe silsile ke bare main ekadam sahi the
 India has also been surprised by them for some time
 yah silsilaa 2006 main china ke tatkaaleen raashtrapati hu jintao kii yatra se thik pehle shuru hua tha jab bharat main china kii rajdoot sun eukshi ne arunachal pradesh par saream china kaa daawa thonka tha
 After that the angry reactions had spoiled the travel atmosphere
 phir 2010 main china ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri wain jiyabaao kii yatra se pehle china jammu-kashmir ke nivaasiyon ko yah kahkar natthi vija dene laga ki kshetra vivaadit he
 In May last year, a few weeks before China's first visit to the new Prime Minister of China, Li Keqiang, Chinese forces set up tents in the Depsang plain in Ladakh
 is takaraav se yatra radd hote-hote bachi
 This time, a few days before President Xi's visit, Demchok and Chumar were again forced to dominate and dominate the atmosphere
 haalanki modi ne tasveeron ko shandaar dikhaane kii bharpoor koshish kii
 The worst effect was that these incidents reduced the scope for some meaningful progress towards the boundary issue
 phir bhi donon paksh pradhanmantri or china ke raashtrapati yaa pradhanmantri ke bich har saal usee tarah baithken karne par sahamat hue jaise bharat rus or japan ke saath karata he
 This indicated a desire to reinforce political dialogue at the pinnacle of leadership
 seemaa ke mudde par baatcheet ko aage badhaane ke liye bharat abhi apana vishesh pratinidhi tay nahin kar paaya he phir bhi usne vaastavik niyantran rekha kii sthiti spasht karne kii prakriya shuru karne ke liye ek-duusare ko nakshe dene kii baatcheet par jor daalaa
 There was no significant progress on any of the other contentious issues
 inamen seemaa paar bahane vaali nadiyon par baandhon ke nirmaan or arunachal pradesh ke nivaasiyon ko natthi vija jaise masale shaamil he
 On the economic front there has been more concrete success (see chart)
 china ne agle paanch saal main 20 arab dollar ke nivesh kaa vaada kiya he
 Most of this investment will be in two industrial parks and railways
 ek audyogic park bijli sector ke liye vadodara main or doosraa automobile ke liye pune main lagaaya jayega
 China will pay money to prepare a project report on the feasibility of running high speed trains in India
 china do atyaadhunik railway stesan bhi banayega
 One of these will be brand new and an existing station will be transformed
 bhartiya bijness industry ke sarokaaron kaa dhyaan rakhte hue donon paksh ek-ek smart city ko god lene par sahamat ho gaye
 Indian IT companies will get an opportunity to set up an IT network in a city in China, while China will develop infrastructure facilities in a smart city in India
 donon deshon kii ek team bhartiya dawa companiyon ke liye kaarobaari maukon main baadhak niyamon par gaur karegaa
 China has also agreed to open a new route for Indian travelers going to Kailash Mansarovar
 raashtrapati shi kii is yatra kii shuruyaat bahut anokhi rahi
 The Prime Minister showed him a glimpse of his home state and thus indicated his priorities
 narendra modi apane sahyogiyon se kehete rahe hai ki ve pehle atmiyata paidaa karnaa chaahate hai or us paimaane se dekhen to modi ne kaaphi duuri tay kar lee he
 In the words of Gujarat officials, he made a Modi jacket for President Xi, presented him with a Chinese version of the Bhagavad Gita, an autobiography of Mahatma Gandhi in Chinese language and a DVD of the Gandhi film with a Chinese subtitle
 sabarmati ke tat par saiyr ke dauraan unhone kai baar suraksha gheraa todaa or mehmaanon ko gujarat kii alag-alag nrity vidhaon kii baarikiyaan samajhaayin ek dancer ko china ke raashtrapati kii patni peng liyuan ko gujarati kangan pehanaane or uskaa mahatv samajhane kaa mauka bhi diya gaya
 At that dinner, Modi took the initiative and, according to the people inside, asked Xi to confess several questions about his life
 pradhanmantri ne unke ateet ke bare main or communist party se unke pita shi jhengashun ko nikaale jane ke baad ai kathinaaiyon ke bare main sawaal kiye
 He then asked about Xi's development model for China and mentioned his efforts to eradicate corruption
 yah baat or he ki shi ne shaleenta or aupchaarikta ke daayre main rahete hue modi ke saath koi lambii baatcheet nahin kii
 —with Uday Mahurkar maharashtra ke shiksha mantri vinod taavade ne somvaar ko kaha ki pune ke ek santhaan se ejineering kii jo 'degree' unhone hasil kii he vah farji nahin he, jaisaa ek televijan samachar channel ne daawa kiya he
 The minister's clarification came after media reports said that his BE degree was fake
 taavade ne kaha, 'main pune dayaneshwar viapeeth kaa chaatr rahaa hum or mujhe is par garv he
 i never hid the degree i received from university
 ' taavade ne kaha, 'viapeeth main ek brij course shuru kiya gaya tha jiskaa lakshya saidhantik jaankaree ke saathchatro ko praayogic jaankaridena tha
 i enrolled in the course in 1980 and passed in 1984
 paathyakram main part time shiksha or part time internship di jaati he
 "the minister said," while enrolling the students it was said that the syllabus is not recognized by the government
 main ise jaanata tha or maine ise sweekaar kiya
 He said Kimanohar Joshi's chancellor of Vidyapeeth went to court after his rival went to court and the course was banned by the court
 taavade ne kaha, 'maine rajya chunaavon main kabhi bhi snaatak nirvachan kshetra ke sadsy ke taur par panjikaran nahin karaayaa
 Apart from this course, i have studied till 12th standard and i never hide it
 yahaan tak ki mere chunavi halafname main bhi maine apni shiksha ke sabhi pahaluon or jin sthanon par maine adhyayan kiya he uskaa ullekh kiya he
 'he said,' If i had mentioned that i had studied from Mumbai University, University of Pune or Shivaji University, it would have been fraudulent
 lekin maine aisa kuch bhi nahin kiya he
 Meanwhile, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, the Leader of the Opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, demanded Tawde's resignation over the 'fake' degree case

 When the Reserve Bank reviews economic policies, it uses certain words related to some economic world
 agar inhen naa samajha jaaen to un khabaron ko jaananaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 These are the words - repo rate, reverse repo rate and crrrepo banks need money for day to day functioning
 aise halaat main unke liye desh ke kendriya bank yani bhartiya rigerv bank (arabiai) se rin lenaa sabase aasaan vikalp hota he
 The rate at which the Reserve Bank charges interest on such loans from them is called repo rate
 duusare shabdon main rigerv bank duusare camershal bainkon or vittiya sansthaanon ko jis dar se paisa udhaar detaa he, use repo rate kehete hai
 When banks will have loans available at lower rates, they can also lower their interest rates to attract customers, so that the borrowing customers can increase more and more, and give more money to the loan
 isi tarah yadi rigerv bank repo rate main badhotaree karegaa, to bainkon ke liye rin lenaa mahangaa ho jayega, or ve bhi apane graahakon se vasuul kii jane vaali byaaj daron ko badha denge
 Reverse Repo Rate: This is opposite to the repo rate
 kabhi jab bainkon ke paas kaamkaaj ke baad badi rakamen bachi rah jaati hai, ve us rakam ko rigerv bank main rakh diya karte hai, jis par arabiai unhen byaaj diya karata he
 Now the rate at which the Reserve Bank pays interest on this amount is called reverse repo rate
 yani reverse repo vah rate he, jis par duusare bank rigerv bank ko paisa udhaar dete hai
 Actually, reverse repo rate is used to control cash flow in the market
 jab bhi market main bahut zyada nakadi dikhaai detii he, arabiai reverse repo rate badha detaa he, taaki bank adhik byaaj kamaane ke liye apni rakamen uske paas jamaa kara den, or is tarah bainkon ke kabje main market main chhodane ke liye kam rakam rah jaaegi
 Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) Under the banking regulations applicable in the country, each bank has to keep a certain portion of its total cash reserves with the Reserve Bank, which is called the Cash Reserve Ratio or Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)
 siaraar ke jariye arabiai bina reverse repo rate main badlaav kiye market se kaishe ke flo ko kam kar saktaa he
 In the event of CRR increase, banks will have to keep a larger share with the Reserve Bank, and they will have less money to lend as loans

 This book of about three hundred pages published by Blumsbury, by the people involved in Samjhauta blast, Malegaon blast, Ajmer blast, Mecca Masjid blast investigation, affidavits submitted in court of accused, claims of their lawyers and leaders of political parties on different occasions It tries to prove that the word saffron terrorism was a conspiracy by adding links to statements from the side, thinking for political gains Understand were thrown under the strategy and Hindu organizations and leaders of the Union party whose target

 There are many interesting episodes in the book, including one of the nia's agents who met and talked with many of the key targets in the Samjhauta and Malegaon blasts, including Aseemanand's ashram and the bjp's office

 The book also mentions the torture of Sadhvi Pragya whom Pragya is constantly trying to generate sympathy against her by campaigning in Bhopal
 kitaab main kai mahatvapurn sawaal bhi uthaae gaye hai or un kirdaaron ko saamne laayaa gaya he jinke bare main rashtriya str par zyada baat tak nahin kii jaati
 For example, Dilip Patidar, a young man picked up by ATS from Indore, whom no one knows till now is alive or not, and in whose disappearance, two officers of Maharashtra ATS have also taken action
 kitaab ke ek chapter main deshbhar main alag-alag maukey par hue bam dhamaakon kaa zikr he jise padhakar sharir main siharan daudane lagati he
 The book also raises some questions on a section of the media about how the affidavits that were tried to prove the theory of Hindu terrorism were being met with select media groups despite being highly confidential
 ek anya chapter sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat or indresh kumaar kii hatya kii sajeesh ke khulaase par bhi vistaar se prakaash daalata he or sawaal khadaa karata he ki kya sajeesh kii is baat ko isliye dabaa diya gaya kyonki isse bhagava aatank ke aropiyon kaa aresas or phir bijepi se rishta sabit karne main mushkil aati, jisase is puri theory ko khadaa karne ke rajnatik makasad ko hasil karnaa mushkil ho jaataa

 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has fiercely attacked opposition leaders including Rahul Gandhi, who questioned the role of Ajit Doval in questioning Airstrike and sending Masood Azhar out of the country
 unhone kaaphi gusse main kaha ki aise kam jaankaar netaaon ko saarvajanik jivan se baahar kar dena chahie
 Jaitley said this while addressing a special 'security meeting' organized by Aaj Tak to discuss issues related to the security of the country
 is satr kaa sanchaalan india today tivi ke news diarector rahul kanwal ne kiya
 On the question that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has said that if Maulana Masood Azhar is in Pakistan, then BJP is responsible for this, because during Vajpayee ji's BJP government, Ajit Doval had left them till Kandahar, Arun Jaitley said , 'I will ever write how many fakes they are spreading, it is unfortunate for any political party
 aap vansh ke aadhaar par chune yaa kisi or aadhaar par lekin aise vyakti ko chune jo kam se kam kuch jaankaree to rakhata ho
 Rahul should know that Doval was in the IB when this incident happened

 neshnal herald cese main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko bhale hi fori raahat mil gai ho, lekin maamle main sadak se sadan tak siyaasi sangram chhid gaya he
 While Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday told it a conspiracy to directly change, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on behalf of the government also challenged the Congress for an open debate
 rahul gandhi ne bayaan bhale hi puddcheri main diya, lekin iskaa asar rajyasabha main dekhne ko mila
 Congress raised an uproar in the House raising the issue
 is dauraan congress ke saansad wel main bhi utar gaye
 In such a situation, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley immediately proposed a discussion on the National Herald Case in front of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha
 mantri ne kaha ki vah maamle main abhi jawaab dene ko taiyaar hai, lekin pehle hangaamaa band kiya jaae
 Jaitley said, 'there is no talk of political revenge in the National Herald case
 congress ke netaaon ko adaalat ke samaksh pesh hona chahie
 It is a privately-filed complaint and the government has nothing to do with it
 ' vitt mantri ne aage kaha ki sarkaar ne kisi ke khilaaf koi nazaij kadam nahin uthaaya he
 He said that the things that have gone against SP or BSP were in the era of Congress
 'yah raajnneetik pratishodh kii karrwai he'jetali ne kaha ek galatabayani ke baad kisi duusare ko bolne nahin dena uchit nahin he
 He said that the government wants the discussion on corruption to begin immediately and we are ready for it
 isse pehle congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki ham nyaay chaahate hai or chaahate hai ki samvidhan ke anusaar desh chale jahaan sattapaksh or vipaksh donon ko samaan rup se nyaay mili or donon ke liye kanoon alag alag nahin hon
 Azad alleged that action was being taken by political vendetta
 unhone kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bijepi dwaara congress mukt bharat banaae jane kii baat kii jaati thi
 But now it seems that they want opposition-free India, not just Congress
 sthagit kerani padi kaaryvahiazad kii baat samaapt hote hi sadan ke netaa or vitt mantri arun jetali ne bolne kaa prayaas kiya, lekin congress ke sadsy asana ke samaksh aakar phir se narebaaji karne lage
 Meanwhile, Vice President PJ Kurien adjourned the meeting for the entire day at around 1
15 pm due to slogans appearing in front of several Congress members
 iske pehle subah baithak shuru hote hi congress sadsy asana ke samaksh aa gaye or sarkaar par badale kii raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaate hue narebaaji karne lage
 a lot of 'dictatorship' slogans The Congress mps also raised slogans of 'modi your dictatorship will not run' in the House, on which Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi tightened and said that let the Congress people practice by raising slogans
 abhi 15 saal congress ko narebaaji hi kerani he
 On the Congress uproar, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu said that those who do wrong are afraid
 sarkaar kanoon ke mutabik kaam kar rahi he
 Praising Assam for the lowest rate of inequality in the country and high growth in literacy, Union Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh said that despite human development indices, the state carved out 'only for the wrong reasons'

 It ranks among the top three four states in terms of increase in literacy rate, where it outperforms Gujarat
 ramesh ne kaha ki assam maanav vikaas suchakank main bahut kuch hasil kar rahaa he
 i applaud Assam for the important results of human development
 unhone kaha ki durbhaagya se assam keval galat kaarnon se sukhiryon main aata he
 Media does not present the achievements of Assam in human development
 unhone assam rajya maanav vikaas report kii taiyaari par vichaar vimarsh ke liye rajya sarkaar dwaara yojit kaaryshaala main shaamil hone ke baad ye tippaniyan kin
 Within 2 months and 5 days of becoming the Home Minister of the country, Amit Shah took the decision which no Home Minister could make in the last seven decades
 sarkaar ne anuchhed 370 ko na keval asarhin kar diya, balki jammu-kashmir or ladakh ko alag-alag centreshasit pradesh banane kaa bhi faisla kar liya
 With this decision that changed the geography of Jammu and Kashmir, Amit Shah created history as Home Minister
 jabaki bijepi ke adhyaksh ke taur par vah desh ke adhikansh rajyon main bhagava pataakaa fahraakar pehle hi sanghathan kshamta kaa loha manavaa chuke hai
 It is now being said that after the integration of the princely states divided into pieces after independence, Sardar Patel gave the country a thread, while Amit Shah gave a mark to the country
 jisaki maang lambey samay se uth rahi thi
 Incidentally, Amit Shah is from the same Gujarat where Sardar Patel resided
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa bhi maananaa he ki dhara 370 hataane or jammu-kashmir ke punargathan kii kavayadon ke jariye amit shah kaa grih mantri ke taur par desh kii raajnneeti main kad bahut ooncha ho chukaa he
 Whenever bold political decisions are discussed in the country, it will remain incomplete without naming Amit Shah
 unhen modi sarkaar 2
 The Sardar of 0 has also been called
 floor management se bhi dikhaai ranneetik takatrajyasabha main bijepi bahumat main nahin he, phir bhi modi sarkaar har wo bill paas kara le gai, jise usne chaha
 Even the three divorces and the RTI bill that faced the most opposition, the government was successful in passing both houses
 yah amit shah ke floor management kaa hi kamaal rahaa
 Sources reveal that Amit Shah had hired a team of his trusted BJP General Secretary Bhupendra Yadav, Union Ministers Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan and Prahlad Joshi who specializes in behind-the-scenes strategy for floor management
 rajyasabha saansad anil baluni bhi is team kaa hissaa rahe
 The contacts of this team changed the mood of many mps of the opposing parties with the government's bills
 yahi vajah rahi ki jab artiai bill ko lekar 14 dal tiemasi ke notice par ekajute hue the to unke sadasyon kii sankhya 111 ho rahi thi, magar jab voting hui to aankde 95 par tik gaye
 The triple talaq bill also saw a split in opposition
 yah sab amit shah kii banaai ranneetiyon or unki team kii ore se use dharaatal par utaarne kii vajah se sambhav hua
 Shivanand Dwivedi, a senior research fellow at Shahshayama Prasad Mukherjee Research Foundation who specializes in master plans and has written the book 'amit Shah And The March Of BJP' on Amit Shah, says that Amit Shah, before taking any bet, but his loss - Gain the benefits and far-reaching consequences first
 tabhi koi kadam uthaate hai
 This is the reason that if they walk 10 steps then they are successful in 9
 amit shah kai baar charchaaon ke dauraan kehete hai ki anubhav kaa koi silebus nahin hota
 It is earned while working
 unhone ek nahin anek maukon par khud ko kushal ranneetikaar sabit kiya he
 He sets the goal first, then makes rigorous homework for him, and devises a surefire strategy
 jisase lakshya unke kadamon main hota he
 Those who know the functioning of Shah while he was the Home Minister in Gujarat, know how well he has been preparing the master plan
 dvivedi kehete hai ki jammu-kashmir main dhara 370 to jansangh ke jamaane se hi agenda rahaa he
 But there is a difference between taking a resolution and fulfilling it
 amit shah ne aitihaasik faisle ke liye jariye sankalp ko dharaatal par utarkar dikhaa diya
 All this was possible because modi-shah's intention is clear
 shivanand dvivedi kehete hai ki gujarat main grih mantri rahane ke dauraan hi shah maanate the ki desh ke vikaas main aatankwaad, algaavvaad or naksalwad baadhak hai
 These problems can only end when they are hit at the root of those giving economic and ideological food
 us dauraan unhone rajya ke grih mantri ke taur par kai kadam uthaae, magar tab unki simaaen thim
 This is the reason that when Amit Shah became the Home Minister of the country, within 2 months and 5 days, after passing the NIA, anti-terrorism Act UAPA, now he took a big decision on Section 370
 in faislon ko aap dekhenge to paaenge ki amit shah ke sabhi faisle kis tarah ranneetik rup se ek duusare se jude hai
 Amit Shah is known as the most successful president of BJP
 unke netritv main bijepi sabase taqatvar party ban chuki he
 Today the BJP or NDA has a government in 18 states in the country
 bijepi ke paas loksabhaa main 303 loksabhaa saansad or 78 rajyasabha saansad hai
 Amit Shah also gave power to the BJP in states like Assam and Tripura, where it was considered to have negligible status
 agast 2014 main adhyaksh banane se lekar sitambar 2018 tak amit shah ne 7 lakh 90 hajaar kilometre kii yatra kii
 Every day he traveled 519 kilometers
 jisamen 43 pratishat sanghathanaatmak daure or 57 pratishat chunavi daure the
 This can be gauged from Amit Shah's activism
 25 april 2017 ko amit shah ne pashchim bengal ke naksalbadi se dinadayal upaadhyaay vistaar yojana launch kii
 After that, the BJP focused on managing 7 lakh 64 thousand booths in the country
 amit shah and march of bijepi pustak main likhaa he- amit shah kaa maananaa he ki bina vichaardhaara vaali raajnneeti kii koi life nahin hoti
 Just as the body without a soul is not meant, in the same way politics is of no importance without ideology
 jaise koi desh bina samvidhan ke nahin chal saktaa, bina samskruti ke koi samaaj nahin chal saktaa, usee tarah raajnneeti bina vichaardhaara ke nahin chal sakati

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying, 'congress and BJP people have been calling our government a government of five and a half and a half chief ministers, but the BJP is still a chief ministerial candidate for itself Have not been able to find it
 ' mukhyamantri rajdhani ke ek paanch sitara hotel main yojit 'smart infrastracch r summit-2016' main bol rahe the
 During this, he attacked the opposition fiercely
 akhilesh ne kisi kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha, 'jab ham laptop baant rahe the, tab ye log kaha karte the ki yuvaaon ke haathon main jhunjhuna thamaya ja rahaa he or aaj kashmir ke sandarbh main kehete phir rahe hai ki jin haathon main laptop hona chahie, unamem bandook pakadaa di gai he
 "he said," The laptop they are talking about today, Samajwadi Party has started four years ago
 ' The UP CM said, 'success in all our work has given sleep to the opponents
 isliye ve ab hamaari safalataa par pardaa daalane main lage hai
 We set a world record by planting five crore trees in one day and created history, but the Prime Minister took the name of those states where one and two crore plants were planted, but in UP, where five crore plants were planted, he did not name it even once
 
 ' Akhilesh also commented on the role of the media, saying, 'we believe that the incident of Bulandshahr happened very badly, but the same incident happened twice in the same place in nearby Gurgaon, but the media said hi-taaba Did not arise
 media tab hamen tisare number kii party bataa rahi thi, ab number ek bataa rahi he
 Comments unhone lakhanu metro kii charchaa karte hue kaha, 'maine kah rakhaa he ki agali baar jab bajet pesh karne aauungaa to metro par baithkar aauungaa
 We are trying to run the metro in other cities of the state as soon as possible

 According to the Home Minister, there is movement in only two districts

 This is something new
 mandsaur kii saansad congress se hai, magar mandsaur vidhansabha kii aath vidhansabha siton main se saat par bijepi kaa kabza he
 The Congress has one seat in the assembly
 maharashtra main bhi kisaan ek june se hi andolnarat hai

 Some farmers have accepted the proposal of the Chief Minister and some have said that they are not going to accept the assurance

 Farmers are demanding mainly two things

 amit shah ne pitiai se kaha ki modi sarkaar ne nunatam samarthan mulya main laagat kaa 43 pratishat badha kar diya he
 Do farmers know this? kya yah daawa sahi he
 Apart from this, it is being said that by 2022 the income of the farmers will be doubled

 According to the 2016 Economic Survey, it was Rs 1700
 ab is hisaab se kya
 
 
 Between 2012 and 2017, the monthly income of farmers has decreased by Rs 4,726
 -tab kis aadhaar par daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki paanch saal baad aamadani dugani ho jaaegi
 According to -2016, even if 1700 becomes Rs 34,00 in 2022, will it be enough? donon hi aankadon se pataa chalata he ki kisaan itani kam kamai main paanch logon kaa parivaar nahin paal saktaa he
 The government should first tell how much the country's farmer earns this month, so that they will know whether their earnings doubled in 2022
 isamen laagat mulya main vruddhi kaa hisaab joda jayega to 2022 main kisaan or garib ho jayega
 The comments ab aate hai karj maafee par
 On April 4, the UP government announced that up to 1 lakh crop loans of small and marginal farmers are being waived
 is yojana ke tahat do karod 15 lakh kisaan aaenge, jinka kul 30,729 karod rupee kaa karz maaf kiya gaya he
 For this, a six-member committee was formed which will work with all banks to execute the loan waiver process
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri abhi tak yahi kehete rahe ki karj maafee nahin karenge, kyonki yah hal nahin he
 But now they are saying that they are going to forgive the biggest debt in the history of Maharashtra
 aktubar tak tees hazaar karod kaa karja maaf hoga, jisase 34 lakh kisaanon ko laabh hoga
 In UP too, debt of about 30,000 crores is being waived, but only 15 lakh farmers are getting benefited, whereas in UP, up to one lakh debt is being waived

 hamaare sahyogi anuraag dwari ne rajya ke grahamantri bhupendra singh se baat kii
 They said that anti-social elements were looting under the guise of farmers in Mandsaur and Neemuch for 5-6 days
 gadiyon main aag lagaai ja rahi thi
 Even after this, the government has directed that no action should be taken against the farmers
 lagaataar anti soshal element police par hamalaa kar rahe hai or ab hamane aadesh jari kiya he ki agar kahin par kisaanon ke naam par anti soshal element police par hamalaa kar rahe hai to unke khilaaf sakht karrwai ho
 This is part of his own statement that i have read
 grahamantri ke anusaar, sirf do zilon main andolan he
 There is no agitation on behalf of farmers anywhere in the state
 iske peeche congress or anti soshal eliments kaa haath he
 By the way, anti-social elements also agitate farmers today
 ye baat kuch nai he
 Mandsaur mps are from Congress, but BJP holds seven of the eight assembly seats in Mandsaur Assembly
 ek vidhansabha kii seat congress ke paas he
 In Maharashtra too, farmers have been agitating since June 1
 yahaan kisaanon ne chathe din bhi alag-alag jagahon par tehsil karyaalayon ko band kar diya
 It was announced to stop the trains of milk and vegetables going towards the cities
 bid, ahmednagar, kolhapur, pune, nasik, aurangabad, sangli, latur main kisaanon kii hadtaal kaa asar dikhaai de rahaa he
 The Chief Minister says that the government is standing with the farmers, but some people are doing politics by placing guns on the farmers' shoulders
 yah ek tarah se paap he
 In both the states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, the credibility of the farmer movement is questionable in the eyes of the government
 unke kisaan hone par shaq he
 Governments feel that opposing parties are doing politics and committing sins by placing guns on the shoulders of farmers
 or kisaan bade sidhe hai wo apane kandhe par congress ko bandook rakhane de rahe hai
 However, Shiv Sena has given its support to the farmers
 yah sahi he ki kisaanon ke andolan main kai sanghathan shaamil he
 They allege that the government is distributing farmers' organizations
 kuch kisaanon ne mukhyamantri kaa prastaav sweekaar kiya he to kuch kaa kahana he ki ve aashwaasan se nahin maanane vaale
 It is better to come directly on the demand of the farmers
 kisaan mukhya rup se do hi chizon kii maang kar rahe hai
 In Madhya Pradesh as well as in Maharashtra
 
 
 upaj kaa sahi daam mili or karza maaf ho
 The BJP had promised farmers during the Lok Sabha elections
 hindi vaale ghoshnaptr ke pej number 26 par likhaa he ki
 
 
 Steps will be taken to increase the profitability of the agricultural sector
 yah sunishchit kiya jayega ki laagat kaa 50 fisadi laabh ho
 Farmers in Maharashtra are demanding that the produce should be properly priced and 50% of the cost ensured
 28 may ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne pitiai se kaha he ki koi bhi sarkaar swaminathak formula ke hisaab se nahin chal sakati he, kyonki usamen zamin kii laagat bhi shaamil he
 Amit Shah told PTI that the Modi government has increased the minimum support price by 43 percent of the cost
 kya kisaanon ko yah baat maaloom he
 Is this claim correct? iske alaava kaha ja rahaa he ki 2022 tak kisaanon kii aamadani dugani kar di jaaegi
 What is the income of farmers at this time, we have two different figures
 donon main se koi mukammal nahin he phir bhi ek anumaan mil saktaa he
 In the July 2016 Indian Express article in Ashok Gulati and Shweta Saini, it has been said that the last national survey conducted on farmers' income is five years old
 -2012-13 ke neshnal sample survey offis ke anusaar, punjab ke kisaanon kii ausat masik aamadani 18,059 rupee thi
 After this, comes the number of farmers of Haryana
 unki masik aamadani 14, 434 rupee thi
 - The lowest monthly income of farmers of Bihar was Rs
 3,588
 -is survey ke anusaar, bharat ke kisaanon kii ausat masik aamadani hoti he, maatr 6, 426 rupee
 The second figure is from the Economic Survey 2016, mentioned by Devendra Sharma in his article
 yah aankada neshnal sample survey kii tarah puure desh kaa nahin he, sirf 17 rajyon kaa he, jiske anusaar kisaanon kii masik aamadani maatr 1700 rupee hai
 
 
 20,000 per year
 donon main tulana thik nahin rahegi, magar andaaza miltaa he jo bahut khataranaak he
 According to the National Sample Survey, the monthly income of the farmer in 2012-13 was Rs 6,426
 2016 ke aarthik survey ke anusaar, 1700 rupee ho gai
 Now what according to this 
 
 -2012 se 2017 ke bich kisaanon kii masik aamadani main 4,726 rupee kii kami ai he
 - On what basis is the claim that the income will double after five years? -2016 ke hisaab se 1700 agar 2022 main 34,00 rupee ho bhi gai, to kya ye bahut hoga
 Both figures show that a farmer cannot raise a family of five for such a low income
 sarkaar ko sabase pehle yah bataanaa chahie ki is vakt desh kaa kisaan maheene kaa kitna kamata he, taaki unhen pataa chale ki 2022 main uski kamai dugani hui yaa nahin
 If the account of the increase in the cost price will be added, then in 2022 the farmer will become poorer
 tippaniyan Now come to debt forgiveness
 upi sarkaar ne 4 april ko elaan kiya ki laghu or seemaant kisaanon kaa ek lakh tak kaa fasali rin maaf kiya ja rahaa he
 Under this scheme, two crore 15 lakh farmers will come, whose total debt of Rs 30,729 crore has been waived
 iske liye chah sadasyon kii cameti bani thi jo tamaam bainkon ke saath milakar karj maafee kii prakriya ko anjaam degi
 The Chief Minister of Maharashtra has so far kept saying that the loan waiver will not be done as it is not a solution
 magar ab kah rahe hai ki maharashtra ke itihaas kii sabase badi karj maaf karne ja rahe hai
 By October, a loan of thirty thousand crores will be waived, which will benefit 34 lakh farmers
 upi main bhi kareeb 30,000 karod kaa karj maaf ho rahaa he, magar vahaan 15 lakh kisaanon ko hi phayda ho rahaa he, jabaki upi main ek lakh tak kaa karj maaf ho rahaa he
 According to the Home Minister, there is movement in only two districts
 pradesh main kahin par kisaanon kii taraf se koi andolan nahin he
 Congress and anti social elements are behind this
 vaise, aajkal anti soshal element bhi kisaan andolan karte hai
 This is something new
 mandsaur kii saansad congress se hai, magar mandsaur vidhansabha kii aath vidhansabha siton main se saat par bijepi kaa kabza he
 The Congress has one seat in the assembly
 maharashtra main bhi kisaan ek june se hi andolnarat hai
 Here farmers also closed tehsil offices at different places on the sixth day
 shaharon kii taraf jane vaali doodh or sabziyon kii gadiyon ko rokane kaa elaan kiya gaya
 The impact of farmers' strike is visible in Beed, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad, Sangli, Latur
 mukhyamantri kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kisaanon ke saath khadi he, magar kuch log kisaanon ke kandhe par bandook rakhkar raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 It is a sin in a way
 madhya pradesh or maharashtra donon jagahon par sarkaar kii nazar main kisaan andolan kii vishwasaneeyata sandigdh he
 He is suspected to be a farmer
 sarkaron ko lagata he ki virdohi dal kisaanon ke kandhe par bandook rakhkar raajnneeti kar rahe hai or paap kar rahe hai
 And the farmers are very upright, they are letting the Congress bear the gun on their shoulder
 vaise shivasena ne kisaanon ko apana samarthan diya he
 It is true that many organizations are involved in the farmers' movement
 inkaa aarope he ki sarkaar kisaanon ke sanghathanon ko baant rahi he
 Some farmers have accepted the proposal of the Chief Minister and some have said that they are not going to accept the assurance
 behatar he sidhe kisaanon kii maang par hi aa jate hai
 Farmers are demanding mainly two things
 madhyapradesh main bhi or maharashtra main bhi
 
 
 Get the right price for the produce and forgive the loan
 bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav ke vakt kisaanon se vaada kiya tha
 It is written on page number 26 of the manifesto containing Hindi
 
 
 aise kadam uthaae jaaenge ki jisase krishi kshetra main laabh bade
 It will be ensured that there is a 50 per cent benefit of the cost
 maharashtra main kisaan yahi maang kar rahe he ki upaj kii uchit keemat mili or laagat kaa 50 fisadi sunishchit kiya jaae
 On May 28, BJP President Amit Shah told PTI that no government can run according to the Swaminathak formula, because it includes the cost of land
 amit shah ne pitiai se kaha ki modi sarkaar ne nunatam samarthan mulya main laagat kaa 43 pratishat badha kar diya he
 Do farmers know this? kya yah daawa sahi he
 Apart from this, it is being said that by 2022 the income of the farmers will be doubled
 is vakt kisaanon kii aamadani kitni he, hamaare paas do alag-alag aankade hai
 Neither of the two is complete, yet an estimate can be found
 july 2016 main indian express main ashok gulati or shweta saini ke lekh main bataaya he ki kisaanon kii aamadani ko lekar aakhri baar jo rashtriya str par survey hua tha wo paanch saal purana he
 According to the National Sample Survey Office for 2012-13, the average monthly income of farmers in Punjab was Rs 18,059
 -iske baad haryana ke kisaanon kaa number aata he
 His monthly income was Rs 14,434
 -sabase kam bihar ke kisaanon kii masik aamadani thi, 3,588 rupee
 According to this survey, the average monthly income of the farmers of India is only 6, 426 rupees
 doosraa aankada aarthik survey 2016 kaa he, jiskaa zikr devendra sharma ne apane lekh main kiya he
 This figure is not for the entire country like the National Sample Survey, only of 17 states, according to which the monthly income of farmers is only 1700 rupees
 
 
 prati varsh 20,000 rupee
 Comparison between the two will not be good, but the idea is found which is very dangerous
 neshnal sample survey ke anusaar, 2012-13 main kisaan kii masik aamadani 6, 426 rupee thi
 According to the 2016 Economic Survey, it was Rs 1700
 ab is hisaab se kya
 
 
 Between 2012 and 2017, the monthly income of farmers has decreased by Rs 4,726
 -tab kis aadhaar par daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki paanch saal baad aamadani dugani ho jaaegi
 According to -2016, even if 1700 becomes Rs 34,00 in 2022, will it be enough? donon hi aankadon se pataa chalata he ki kisaan itani kam kamai main paanch logon kaa parivaar nahin paal saktaa he
 The government should first tell how much the country's farmer earns this month, so that they will know whether their earnings doubled in 2022
 isamen laagat mulya main vruddhi kaa hisaab joda jayega to 2022 main kisaan or garib ho jayega
 The comments ab aate hai karj maafee par
 On April 4, the UP government announced that up to 1 lakh crop loans of small and marginal farmers are being waived
 is yojana ke tahat do karod 15 lakh kisaan aaenge, jinka kul 30,729 karod rupee kaa karz maaf kiya gaya he
 For this, a six-member committee was formed which will work with all banks to execute the loan waiver process
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri abhi tak yahi kehete rahe ki karj maafee nahin karenge, kyonki yah hal nahin he
 But now they are saying that they are going to forgive the biggest debt in the history of Maharashtra
 aktubar tak tees hazaar karod kaa karja maaf hoga, jisase 34 lakh kisaanon ko laabh hoga
 In UP too, debt of about 30,000 crores is being waived, but only 15 lakh farmers are getting benefited, whereas in UP, up to one lakh debt is being waived
 yahaan kisaanon ne chathe din bhi alag-alag jagahon par tehsil karyaalayon ko band kar diya
 It was announced to stop the trains of milk and vegetables going towards the cities
 bid, ahmednagar, kolhapur, pune, nasik, aurangabad, sangli, latur main kisaanon kii hadtaal kaa asar dikhaai de rahaa he
 The Chief Minister says that the government is standing with the farmers, but some people are doing politics by placing guns on the farmers' shoulders
 yah ek tarah se paap he
 In both the states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, the credibility of the farmer movement is questionable in the eyes of the government
 unke kisaan hone par shaq he
 Governments feel that opposing parties are doing politics and committing sins by placing guns on the shoulders of farmers
 or kisaan bade sidhe hai wo apane kandhe par congress ko bandook rakhane de rahe hai
 However, Shiv Sena has given its support to the farmers
 yah sahi he ki kisaanon ke andolan main kai sanghathan shaamil he
 They allege that the government is distributing farmers' organizations
 kuch kisaanon ne mukhyamantri kaa prastaav sweekaar kiya he to kuch kaa kahana he ki ve aashwaasan se nahin maanane vaale
 It is better to come directly on the demand of the farmers
 kisaan mukhya rup se do hi chizon kii maang kar rahe hai
 In Madhya Pradesh as well as in Maharashtra
 
 
 upaj kaa sahi daam mili or karza maaf ho
 The BJP had promised farmers during the Lok Sabha elections
 hindi vaale ghoshnaptr ke pej number 26 par likhaa he ki
 
 
 Steps will be taken to increase the profitability of the agricultural sector
 yah sunishchit kiya jayega ki laagat kaa 50 fisadi laabh ho
 Farmers in Maharashtra are demanding that the produce should be properly priced and 50% of the cost ensured
 28 may ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne pitiai se kaha he ki koi bhi sarkaar swaminathak formula ke hisaab se nahin chal sakati he, kyonki usamen zamin kii laagat bhi shaamil he
 Amit Shah told PTI that the Modi government has increased the minimum support price by 43 percent of the cost
 kya kisaanon ko yah baat maaloom he
 Is this claim correct? iske alaava kaha ja rahaa he ki 2022 tak kisaanon kii aamadani dugani kar di jaaegi

 apane saahsee andaaj ke liye pahachaane jane vaale superstar shahrukh khan ne kaha ki unki film ke set par mahilaon ke saath durvyavhaar karne kii kisi main himmat nahin he
 The actor, who was awarded the Crystal Award at the World Economic Forum summit along with Hollywood celebrities like Cat Blanchett and Elton John in Davos, spoke about gender equality in Bollywood and cultural differences in India
 chauthe bachche kii planning main shahrukh? ye rakhaa he namahollywood main shaktishaalee purushon ke khilaaf dushkarm ke aaropon par ugr bahes ke bich, shahrukh se hindi film udyog main aisa kuch dekhe jane ke bare main poocha gaya
 To this, Shah Rukh said on BBC World News' hardtalk, "when i am filming or working in a film, we are very clear about our behavior towards women
 yahaan tak ki sabase chote paksh ko lekar bhi mahilaon kaa dhyaan diya jaataa he, jaise ki film ke tital main bhi unke naam pehle aate hai, haalanki isse kuch hota-jaataa nahin he, lekin isse sammaan jo jaahir hota hi he
 "suhana's cool look with Shah Rukh Khan, see PHOTOS
 He said," This small thing is also needed to bring equality
 dekhie to hamane khud ko kitna chota kar liya he
 By putting a girl's name forward it is clear how we are, the thinking behind it is just equality
 "unhone kaha, "maine vyaktigat taur par kabhi aisa nahin kiya, apni ankhon se dekha bhi nahin, main yah kah saktaa hum ki mere set par koi bhi mahilaon ke saath durvyavhaar kii himmat nahin kar saktaa, ise lekar main bahut spasht hum
 " meerut main police ne soshal cites ke sahare ladakiyon ko fansaakar unki ashleel video banane vaale ek giroh kaa pardaafash kiya he
 This gang used to blackmail those girls with the help of videos
 meerut main ek bade adhikari kii beti ne police ko shikaayat darj karai thi ki ek ladke ne pehle uske saath soshal site par dosti kii
 And later made her pornographic video on the pretext of modeling photo shoots
 vah ladkaa us ladki lagaataar blackmel kar rahaa tha
 Then she got upset and filed a case in the police station
 police ne maamle ko gambhirtha se lete hue jaal failaayaa
 And arrested 3 students
 police ne bataaya ki ye ladke pehle ladakiyon se soshal cites par dosti karte the or baad main unhen milane bulaate the
 After that the process of meeting started
 police ke mutabik uske baad ye ladke dosti kaa jaal bichhaakar pool party, drugs orphoto shoot ke bahaane ashleel videobana lete the
 After that girls were blackmailed and committed wrongdoings
 police ko shaq he ki or bhi ladkiyaan in teenon kaa shikaar ho sakati hai
 The accused are being questioned by the police
 is sambandh main thane par maamla darj kar liya gaya he
 When the terror of this peace falls, then the world falls into doubt that it is not planning anything big? And the same thing happens
 is baar bhi duniya ke is sabase bade aatanki ne ek video jari kar apni nai taiyaari kaa khulaasa kiya he
 This is the preparation to hide and shoot Iraqi and Kurdish army soldiers
 bagdadi ke is mishan ko puraa kar rahe hai wo nishanchin jinhen bagdadi ne apane bure vaqt ke liye taiyaar kiya tha or bachaa kar rakhaa tha
 After this new decree of Baghdadi, its most high-tech terrorists are engaged in the last attempts to save the Sultanate of Panic
 behad advanced sniper raifalon se las aatank ke in gurgon kaa ek hi makasad he, maaro varanaa vahiin mar jaao
 Baghdadi is also beginning to suspect that there are no more days of Khilafat left in Iraq
 lihaaza apni sultanate bachaane ke liye wo har jatan kar rahaa he
 In this last attempt, he has fielded these snipers
 jo kaayron kii tarah mosul ke ilaakon main chhupachup kar sainikon ko apni goliyon kaa nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 Terror boss named this mission 'the Strike of Bullet'
 bagdadi apane in nishaanchiyon ko pichley kai saalon se taiyaar kar rahaa tha
 But there will be a chance to field these operatives of terror so soon
 ye use andaaza nahin tha
 They have been ordered that neither a single bullet should be fired nor where the bullet came from
 lihaaza jab tak dabl shyor na ho jaao goli nahin chalani chahie
 That is why when Iraqi soldiers are seen in the middle of this target, only then is there a gumblish in the finger placed on the trigger
 neeche chaaron taraf se iraqi or kurdish senaaon ne gher liya he
 Above, the American jet fighters have kept the ammo alive
 zindagi kii ummid kisi bhi surat main nazar nahin aa rahi he
 But even after burning, the force of the rope is still left
 bagdadi ke gurgon ne ye tay kiya he ki naa jienge
 Will not let you live jab jab sena ko lagata he ki ilaake ko unhone aatankiyon se azaad kara liya he
 Then the sniper then shoots in hiding
 dushman kaa saamana karnaa aasaan he magar in kaayron kaa koi saamana kaise kare jo bill main dubak kar hamalaa karte hai
 This special kind of dress has been given to the snipers so that the army is deceived to identify them from a distance
 doorabeen isliye taaki sena ke har movement par nazar rakhi ja sake
 Camera so that they can get reward by giving proof of their poise to the owner
 ye manzar 'da strike of bullate' naam ke us propeganda video kaa hissaa he jo aatank kii duniya se jari hua he
 The media wing of ISIS aims to release this video of Ninawa, telling the world that Baghdadi has not given up yet
 jabaki jaankaron ke mutabik rozaana saikadon kii taadaad main aatanki yaa to maare ja rahe hai yaa sarender kar rahe hai
 Baghdadi is adopting different tactics daily to save its terrorist organization
 bagdadiko ab aisa gumaan he ki wo apane is nae plan ke zarie na sirf apni sultanate ko bachaa paaegaa balki waapas wo apni pehle jaisi takat bhi hasil kar legaa
 Although the date has not been decided yet, it is true that Baghdadi in Iraq is going to be recorded in history very soon
 jang ke maidan main vaise bhi ye koi nai baat nahin he
 The loser flashes all over before the end
 kuch isi intehaa tak pahunch chukaa haiaatank kaa akabagdadi

 In Mainpuri, the thugs have grabbed the woman's land by telling a dead woman dead
 mahila is frod ke sambandh main adhikariyon ke chakkar kaat rahi he, lekin adhikari kathith taur par mahila kii andekhi kar rahe hai
 The case is in Nagla Usar village of Kuravali tehsil
 The jalas have allegedly shown the woman dead in the records of the tehsil after meeting Lekhpal to grab the land
 jaalsaajon ne khud ko mahila kaa vaaris bataakar jameen apane naam kar lee, saath hi tehsil kshabhilekhon main jaalsaajon ne apana naam darj kara liya he
 Despite all this, the woman was not aware of the fraud
 jab jaalsaajon ne jameen bechney kii pahal kii tab jaakar mahila ko is dhokhadhadi kii jaankaree hui
 Taking cognizance of this matter, the SDM has suspended the accountant
 saath hi adhikari jaanch main jute gaye hai
 What is the matter? By showing the woman Kailadevi living in Nagla Usar village of Kuravali tehsil dead, the fraudsters got the land in their name
 jaalsaajon ne lekhpal se milakar bataur vaaris tehsil kii khatauni main apane naam darj kara liya
 After naming the land, the fraudsters also made a deal to sell the land, when Kailadevi herself came to know about the fraud that happened
 kaaphi samay se mahila kailadevi khud ko jivit sabit karne ke liye adhikariyon ke chakkar kaat rahi hai lekin tehsil ke abhilekhon main abhi bhi kailadevi murda hai
 Kailadevi bought this 14 bigha land in the year 2009, since then she has been doing farming
 ab bhi unke khet main fasal khadi he
 How was the information about fraud? Kailadevi alleges that i met the village headman on 14 November 2009 and showed me dead in the records of the Tehsil
 aropiyon ne tehsil kii khatauni main vataur vaaris apane naam farji tareeke se darj kara liya he
 Not only this, these fraudsters also made a deal to sell the land
 jab jameen kharidne vaale log jameen dekhne gaye tab kailadevi ko dhokhadhadi kii jaankaree hui
 When Kailadevi took out his land's Khatauni from the Tehsil, the above accused got a proper heir
 tehsil ke abhilekhon murda darj ho chuki kailadevi kaaphi samay se jivit hone ke liye adhikariyon ke chakkar kaat rahi he, guhaar laga rahi he, lekin abhi tak use jivit nahin qaraar diya gaya he
 Kailadevi is still dead in tehsil records

 The Bharatiya Janata Party has been working for a long time on the strategy of encircling the Congress in its fortifications - Amethi and Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh
 vahiin, sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne in donon loksabhaa siton par congress ke khilaaf apane ummidavaar na utaarne kii faisla karke rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi kii siyaasi raah ko aasaan kar diya he
 Whereas, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had tried to surround Rahul in Amethi, due to which the Congress was left sweating to save its fort
 aise main 2019 ke chunaav main sapa-basapa gathbandhan agar congress adhyaksh- rahul gandhi or upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke khilaaf apane ummidavaar utaar dete to congress ko apane garh ko bachaane main mushkilen pesh aatin
 The BJP has been active for a long time to feed the lotus in Amethi and Rae Bareli
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi raibareli kaa daura kiya tha
 During this time, he had flagged off several development plans and also addressed a big rally
 iske alaava bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne donon kshetron kaa daura karke congress netaaon ko apane saath jodne kaa kaam kiya he
 Interestingly, in both Amethi and Raeberli seats, Dalit and OBC especially Yadav community voters are quite well
 iske alaava amethi main muslim matadaata kareeb 4 lakh ke kareeb hai or raibareli main teen lakh ke kareeb yadav hai
 Experts believe that if the SP-BSP alliance had gone to the electoral fray against the Congress, the possibility of a split in these voters would have increased and the BJP would have benefited directly from it
 sapa netaa or purv jila panchayat adhyaksh ramsingh yadav ne kaha ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan raibareli or amethi main chunavi maidan main utarate to congress ke liye ye siten jeetna aasaan nahin hota
 In both the seats, the caste equation is in favor of the alliance, in such a situation, the SP-BSP has given life to the Congress in these seats
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sapa raibareli kii chaar siten jeetne main safal rahi thi or congress khaataa nahin khol pai thi
 At the same time, Naushad Khatib, Rae Bareli District Secretary of Congress, says that BSP has been contesting elections in Rae Bareli and Amethi every time, but the Congress leadership has never faced any problem
 is kshetra kii janata jatvaad, dharmavad or bhai-bhatijevad se upar uthakar congress netritv ko vot karti he
 In such a situation, even if the SP-BSP contests in these two seats, they are not able to make any significant impact, because the assembly and Lok Sabha elections are different
 haalanki saamaanya vichaardhaara ke lihaaj se unhone apane ummidavaar nahin utaare hai, iskaa nishchit rup se hamen bada phayda milegaa
 Explain that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP fielded Smriti Irani against Rahul Gandhi
 amethi sansadeey seat par rahul gandhi ko kareeb chaar lakh or bijepi kii smriti irani ko kareeb teen lakh vot mili the
 Whereas SP had not fielded any candidate in support of Congress
 iske baavjood rahul kareeb 1 lakh vot se hi jeet sake the
 Apart from this, the Congress account could not be opened in the 2017 assembly elections in Amethi
 jabaki bijepi ne paanch vidhansabha siton main se chaar par jeet hasil kii thi or ek seat sapa kii jholii main gai thi
 At the same time, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP fielded Ajay Agarwal from Sonia Gandhi from Rae Bareli
 modi lahar ke baavjood wo sonia ke saamne kadi chunauti pesh nahin kar sake the
 But the BJP had received about two lakh votes
 iske baad jab 2017 main vidhansabha chunaav hue to bijepi ko 2, congress ko 2 or ek seat par sapa ko jeet mili thi
 However, Congress MLC Dinesh Singh and District Panchayat President Awadhesh Singh have left the party and joined BJP
 iske alaava harchandrapur se congress vidhayak rakesh singh bhale hi bijepi jwoin nahin kiya ho, lekin wo congress ke saath bhi nahin khadey dikh rahe hai
 BJP has planned to siege Rae Bareli and Amethi in 2019

 She is constantly visiting Amethi and continues to surround the Congress high command by raising local issues

 The political battle of Lok Sabha elections 2019 in West Bengal is going to new level daily
 isi silsile main pashchim bengal kii siem mamata banerjee ne shanivaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tulana kalidas se kii
 The world was known as a fool before Kalidas became a great Sanskrit writer
 pashchim bengal kii siem mamata banerjee ne hughali main ek raily main kaha, "aap sabhi kalidas kii kahani ke bare main jaanate hai, vah ped kii jis daal par baitha tha, usee ko kaat rahaa tha, narendra modi bhi usee shakha ko kaat rahe hai or desh, rajya or yahaan tak ki logon ko bhi baant rahe hai"mamata banerjee ne kaha ki agar pradhanmantri yahaan aakar yah kehete hai ki hamane logon ko markar taang diya, to yah or kuch nahin, balki logon ko uksaana he
 He said, "it happens in villages
 kuch log dukh kii vajah se aatmahatya kar lete hai, ve kah rahe hai ki hamane unke kaaryakartaaon ko maaraa he, jabaki postmortem report main sabhi maamalon main aatmahatya kii baat kahi gai he
 "addressing the election meeting in Hooghly and Howrah districts, Mamata Banerjee said that the BJP should be rejected and it should refrain from voting
 tiemasi adhyaksh mamata banerjee ne shanivaar ko kaha ki bijepi 440 volt kii tarah desh ke liye sabase bada khatra he
 He said that people should stop BJP from coming to power
 mamata banerjee ne hughali jile ke pandua main hughali loksabhaa kshetra se trinmul congress ummidavaar ratna de naag ke paksh main ek chunavi raily main kaha, "main aashwaasan detii hum ki yadi trinmul satta main aati he to desh kaa koi nuksaan nahin hoga, bijepi or narendra modi yadi duusari baar satta main aae to ve desh ko barbaad kar denge, bijepi 440 volt kii tarah desh ke liye sabase bada khatra he
 "he said that this election is going to remove the BJP government
 haavda jile ke joipur or paanchala main siem mamata banerjee ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ne pichley paanch saalon main janakalyaan or desh ke bhavishya ke liye kuch bhi nahin kiya
 Mamta said, "good days have become a tragedy for all, if the Modi government is not uprooted from power then the country will face a great danger
 "mamata banerjee ne sawaal kiya ki dharm ke naam par desh ko baantne ke liye utaaru bijepi kaise satta main lautne kii hasarat paal sakati he
 He said, "how can BJP claim that it is a party of Hindus, BJP has no respect for Hinduism, Modi's party is for creating riots like unrest in the country
" " mamata banerjee ne daawa kiya ki trinmul congress ne tarakeshwar, gangasagar, dakshineshwar, tarapith or kankalithala jaise dharmasthalon main dher sara vikaas kiya he
 Let me tell you that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in a special conversation with Akshay Kumar that he has a good relationship with many leaders of the opposition
 piem ne mamata banerjee ke saath apane sauhardrapurn rishton kaa zikr karte hue kaha tha ki mamata banerjee ne bengal se kurte bhejti hai or rasagulle kaa sandeshaa bhejti he
 Although when Mamta Banerjee came to know about this, she expressed displeasure at the PM that this is Bengali culture, but she will not get a single vote from Bengal

 At that time, Khattar had an ax in his hand

 surajevaala ne khatter par kataaksh karte poocha ki vah naaraaz kyon he
 He tweeted, Anger and arrogance is bad for health
 vah apane hi samarthak ko kah rahe hai ki galaa kaat duungaa
 What will the public do after that? ' Asked how to know if the option is available until someone is given a chance, Gavaskar said, "the timing is not right
" sambhavat: nagpur test ke baad punarvichaar kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki shrunkhlaa samaapt ho jaaegi
 Gavaskar called Amarnath's decision to speak on the selection dispute as encouraging
 unhone kaha, jimi ne jo kiya vah kaaphi hausale vaala kaam he or isse sabak seekhney kii jarurat he
 He was encouraged and he is ready to face the consequences
 tippaniyan On Amarnath's allegations of not approving the decision to remove Dhoni from captaincy, g Srinivar said, "it has always been protocol that final approval is taken from the board
" isamen kuch bhi asaadhaaran nahin he
 This is also done in the cricket boards of England and Australia
 yah poochne par ki dhoni chennai superkings ke captain he, jo board adhyaksh kii frenchiji he, to kya isaki bhi captaini mudde main bhoomika rahi, gavaskar ne kaha, yah kahana mushkil hoga
 We have to believe that the BCCI President has the interest of cricket in the country
 gavaskar ne chayan vivaad par bolne ke amarnath ke faisle ko hausale bharaa qaraar diya

 The comments dhoni ko captaini se hataane ke faisle ko en shrinivasana ke sweekruti nahin dene ke amarnath ke aaropon par gavaskar ne kaha, yah protocol hameshaa se rahaa he ki board se antim sweekruti lee jaati he
 There is nothing extraordinary in this
 england or australia ke cricket board main bhi aisa kiya jaataa he
 Asked if Dhoni is the captain of Chennai Super Kings, the franchise of the board president, did it also have a role in the captaincy issue, Gavaskar said, saying it would be difficult to say
 hamen vishwaas karnaa hoga ki bisisiai adhyaksh ke dil main desh ke cricket kaa hit he
 On Amarnath's allegations of not approving the decision to remove Dhoni from captaincy, g Srinivar said, "it has always been protocol that final approval is taken from the board

 loksabhaa chunaav ke kareeb aane ke saath hi bihar main raajnneetik sameekaran teji se badalte dikh rahe hai
 Ramvilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which has tried its luck in alliance with the Congress in the last few elections, may tie up with the BJP this time
 lojpa ke varisht netaa suraj bhaan singh kii maane to donon partiyon ke bich gathbandhan ko lekar samjhaute ho chukaa he or party jald hi iskaa elaan kar sakati he
 Suraj Bhan said, 'the alliance between BJP and LJP is almost certain
 jald hi isaki aupchaarik ghoshnaa kar di jaaegi
 ' haalanki party adhyaksh ramvilas paswan ne is par philhal chuppi saadh rakhi he
 At the same time, Chirag Paswan, the son of party leader and Ram Vilas Paswan, says that a meeting of the party's parliamentary board is going to take place in two days, in which a final decision will be taken in this regard
 gauratlab he ki lojpa pramukh passvana ne pichley maheene ghoshnaa kii thi ki bihar main unki party lalu prasad yadav kii rajd or congress ke saath milakar loksabhaa chunaav ladegi
 It is being said that Ram Vilas Paswan is trying to get 6 to 8 seats for his party, but neither the RJD nor the Congress is willing to give him so many seats, so Paswan wants to negotiate with the BJP and increase the pressure on the Congress
 
 is bich, ravivaar subah rajya ke purv upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne bhaajapa or lojpa ke bich sambhavit gathbandhan kaa sanket dete hue samprag sarkaar par rajnatik hisaab-kitaab baraabar karne ke liye ek saarvajanik upkram main bhartee ghotaalaa main ramvilas paswan ke khilaaf sibiai kaa durupyog karne kaa aarope lagaaya

 ' bhaajapa ke varisht netaa ne kaha ki jab lojpa ke saath gathbandhan karne kaa prayaas vifal hote dikhaa to congress paswan ko pratadit karne ke liye sibiai kaa durupyog kar rahi he
 Modi, however, refused to confirm the speculation that talks were going on behind the scenes to form an alliance between BJP and LJP for general elections
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa ne kaha ki philhal lojpa rajg kaa hissaa nahin he, lekin raajnneeti main kisi bhi sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Starting 2018 on a positive note

 com / 1ixefkwsny maharashtra main bhartiya janata party apana astitv bachaane main jarur kaamyaab rahi, lekin use vah safalataa nahin mili jisaki party netaaon ne ummid kii thi
 The bjp-shiv Sena alliance together won 161 seats in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, but the alliance lost 24 seats
 akeli bijepi 122 siton se 105 par aa gai
 The most shocking thing was that the saffron party lost in its stronghold Vidarbha
 india today kii data intelegence unit (DIU) ne maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad vidarbha kshetra ko lekar chunavi vishleshan kiya
 We found that in Vidarbha region, BJP lost 15 such seats which it already had
 44 se 29 par pahunchi bijepividarbha maharashtra kaa purvi ilaaka he jahaan par vidhansabha kii 62 siten hai
 This time BJP has won 29 seats in the region, while in the last assembly election it won 44 seats from here
 iskaa matlab he ki party ko vidarbha kshetra main 15 siton kaa nuksaan hua
 a subtle analysis of the seats shows that BJP lost 19 such seats in Vidarbha, which it had won in the last election
 lekin, vah teen aisi siten jeet gai jo 2014 main haar gai thi
 In this way, the Vidarbha region suffered a total loss of 15 seats to the BJP
 bijepi kii sahyogi shivasena bhi vidarbha main chaar siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 Shiv Sena had won only four seats from here in 2014
 diaiu ne paaya ki congress or ensipi ke vipakshi gathbandhan ne is baar vidarbha kii baaji jeet lee
 In 2014, the Congress got 10 seats from Vidarbha region, but this time the Congress seats increased to 15
 ensipi ko 2014 main ek seat mili thi, jo is baar 6 siten jiti hai
 In 2014, where 2 independents won the elections in Vidarbha, this time 5 independents from this region have reached the assembly by winning
 iske alaava, vidarbha kshetra se swabhimani paksh ne 1 seat or prahaar janashakti party (PJP) ne 2 seat jiti he
 Not only the seats, even the difference of the votes BJP had won last time has also decreased this time
 2014 main bijepi ne vidarbha main jo 44 siten jiti thim un sabhi siton par jeet kaa ausat antar 14
 Was 1 percent
 jabaki congress ne 10 siten 5
 She won by an average margin of 6 per cent
 2019 main bijepi kaa jeet kaa ausat antar ghatakar 11
 8 per cent, while the average margin of victory of Congress increased to 10
 8 fisadi ho gaya
 ncp's average margin of victory in the region is 7
 41 par sthir rahaa
 Why is Vidarbha important? Vidarbha is a BJP stronghold and home region
 mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis isi kshetra se aate hai
 Many other ministers also come from this area
 isi kshetra se senior bijepi netaa evam kendriya mantri nitin gadakari loksabhaa chunaav jite hai
 Nagpur is the largest district of Vidarbha region
 2014 main bijepi ne nagpur kii 12 main se 11 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 This time the party has won only 6 of these 12 seats
 baaki chah siton main se 4 congress ne, 1 ensipi ne or 1 nirdaleey ummidavaar ne jiti he
 Such a huge defeat of this region must have worried the Bharatiya Janata Party
 lekin vidarbha kshetra main is badi haar kaa kaaran kya he?pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke baad se hi is kshetra main raajnneetik rup se uthal-puthal chal rahi thi
 Nani Patole of Sakoli became an MP from BJP in 2014 defeating NCP veteran Praful Patel
 pichley june main unhone congress jwine kar lee or apni sansad kii sadsyta se istipha de diya
 This time the Congress fielded him against Parinay Phuke, a minister in the Fadnavis government
 parinay phuke fadanvis ke kareebi maane jate hai
 This seat was very special for BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi also went to campaign here
 vidarbha main bijepi ke ek or mantri morshi seat se haar gaye
 Devendra Mahadevrao Bhoyar of the Swabhimani Paksh defeated Agriculture Minister Anil Sukhdevrao Bonde
 fadanvis sarkaar main mantri rajkumaar badole ko ensipi ke chandrikapur manohar govardhan ne mahaj 718 voton se haraa diya
 Rajkumar Dayaram Patten, who switched parties, contested from BJP in 2009 and NCP in 2014 from Melghat seat
 2019 main ve prahaar janashakti party ke tikat par chunaav lade or bijepi pratyaashee ramesh mavaskar ko haraa diya
 Chandrasekhar Bhavanakule, a three-time MLA and a minister in the Maharashtra government, was denied a ticket this time
 bhavankule taili samudaay se aate hai jisaki vidarbha main acchhee khaasi sankhya he
 The denial of tickets to them also had an impact on the voters of the community
 bhavankule gadakari ke samarthak or vidarbha kshetra ke prabhaavshaalee netaa hai
 It is also being said that Nitin Gadkari was not given priority in election campaign like 2014
 gadakari ne is chunaav kul 30 reliyaan kin, jinamein se zyaadaatar vidarbha kshetra main hi thim, lekin aisa lagata he ki vaanchit parinaam nahin mila
 The most interesting political storm in Maharashtra was seen in Gondia
 gopaldaas agarwal chunaav se thik pehle congress chhodkar bijepi main shaamil ho gaye
 The BJP also gave him a ticket from Gondia seat
 isi seat se vinod agarwal tikat maang rahe the lekin party ne unhen tikat dene se inkaar kar diya
 Vinod Aggarwal contested the election independently and defeated Gopaldas Agarwal
 bijepi ko is baat kaa ehsaas nahin tha ki cader ke bich vyaapt asantosh kaa asar chunaav par bhi padegaa
 Social activist Anna Hazare, who has launched a mass movement against corruption in the country, has said that today's corrupt leaders are looting public money, so it is very important to bring a Jan Lokpal bill
 anna hajaare ne bhrasht netaaon par barasate hue kaha ki pataa nahin aise netaa desh ko kahaan le jaaenge
 He said that the leaders are looting public money
 jan lokapal bill kaa virodh isliye ho rahaa he ki netaaon main dar he ki agar lokapal bill paas ho gaya, to wo lut nahin machaa sakenge
 Hazare said that the intoxication of power dominates the government
 ab ye bhrasht netaa, hamaare rakshak hi bhakshak ban gaye hai
 Demanding the Jan Lokpal Bill, he said that the participation of the public in the making of the law should be approved
 is desh main janata maalik he, netaa sevak hai, ye baat bhrasht netaa bhul gaye hai
 Anna Hazare said that the people elect their representatives and send them to Parliament to serve
 mantriyon ko training kii sakht jarurat he
 They have completely forgotten the democracy
 hajaare ne kaha ki har naagarik ko sarkaar se apane paise kaa hisaab lene kaa puraa haq he
 The British left but their laws are still in force
 unhone bhrasht netaaon ko aagaah karte hue kaha ki ve itnaa jaan len ki unka do number kaa paisa unke kisi kaam nahin aayega or teen number main bekaar chalaa jayega
 This philanthropist said that people should understand the strength of their vote
 janata ke adhikaar bade hai
 He cast his vote by taking 500 rupees or in exchange for a bottle of wine
 anna hajaare ne aagaah kiya ki sarkaar janata kii bhashaa samajhe, nahin to use janaa hoga
 Expressing dismay at the corruption cases coming up every day, he said that while the scams are being exposed, the scamsters are not going to jail
 unhone apil kii ki bhrasht mantri khud hi cabinet se hataae jaaen
 Standing firm on his fast unto death, he said that as long as he is alive, his fast will continue
 unhone mazaakia lahaze main kaha ki deshbhakti ke gaanon ko sunakar unka beepi thik ho gaya
 If the government does not agree on the Jan Lokpal bill, even if their health will not be right

 Gandhi's speech however did not soften the hearts of some industrialists and he said that Congress leaders talk about problems and they have no solution to these problems
 samvaad ke dauraan rahul ne kaha ki unke pradhanmantri banane or unki shaadi ke bare main sawaalon kaa koi matlab nahin he
 According to CII nominated chairman s Gopalakrishnan, this was his first interaction with the business community and he has satisfied the industry

 On Congress President Rahul Gandhi's statement of becoming Prime Minister in 2019, SP President Akhilesh Yadav said that it will be decided only after the Lok Sabha elections that who will become the PM? It is clear that SP is not yet agreeing on Rahul's name
 ye baat akhilesh ne aaj lakhanu main samvaadadaataaon se kahi
 Akhilesh Yadav deferred the question of Rahul Gandhi becoming Prime Minister today
 unhone kaha ki abhi is baat par kuch bhi kahana jaldbaaji hogi
 The decision in the name of the Prime Minister of the country will be possible only after the Lok Sabha elections
 akhilesh ne kaha ki pradhanmantri banane ke bare main congress ke adhyaksh rahul gandhi kya kehete hai, is par mujhe kuch bhi nahin bolnaa he
 In fact, during the election campaign in Karnataka, Rahul Gandhi had said in response to a question that if Congress becomes the largest party, then it can become Prime Minister

 upi police ne narendra gurjar naam ke shaks ko marpet kar jail main band kiya or jail main hi uski maut ho gai
 You will find out how the police have done injustice to the family
 akhilesh ne kaha ki narendra kaa parivaar mujhe dilli main mila, maine kaha ki yogi sarkaar tumhen mujhase upi main milane nahin degi
 After all, the government did the same
 narendra kaa parivaar jabamujhase milane lakhanua rahaa tha, to prashasan ne unhen rokane kii koshish kii
 He said that the government does not give any justice to me, the BJP leaders do what they want
 akhilesh ne upi kii kanoon vyavastha par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki pradesh main har roj hatyaein ho rahi hai
 The lawyer was murdered in Allahabad

 Bollywood actress Twinkle Khanna has recently posted a post from her Instagram account to get drunk on Diwali, seeing everyone laughing and laughing
 darasal, akshay kumaar (akshay Kumar) kii wif or actress tvinkal khanna (twinkle Khanna) ne diwali ke chadhe nashe ko utaarne ke liye aisa tarika bataaya he, jise sun har koi hairaan he or phans us par khub riect bhi kar rahe hai
 This method of Twinkle Khanna is nothing but 'hajmola'
 actress ne apane instagram account par likhaa, 'meri diwali party kaa seen kai log bataanaa chaahate hai
 'need a Diwali Detox in more ways than one:) a post shared by Twinkle Khanna (@twinklerkhanna) on Nov 1, 2019 at 11:12 pm PDT tvinkal khanna (twinkle Khanna) ne aage kaha, 'betaa thodi hajamola le lo
 It is beneficial to have a gas bag
 ' tvinkal khanna ke haalia post ko dekhakar aisa lag rahaa he ki vah baba bananaa chaahati hai
 Twinkle Khanna has used # babatwinkdev while sharing his post
 tvinkal khanna (twinkle Khanna) ke is post par log bhi khub riect kar rahe hai
 Let me tell you, actress Twinkle Khanna (instagram) is often seen sharing her opinion on contemporary issues
 bataa den ki tvinkal khanna (twinkle Khanna) ek behtareen actress hone ke saath hi ek other, stambh lekhak or film produsar bhi hai
 The actress made her debut in the Bollywood world with the film Barsarat, for which she also won the Best Female Debut Filmfare Award
 iske baad vah kareeb 16 filmon main kaam kar chuki hai
 Apart from his film career, he also tried his hand at interior designing
 shina murder cese main roj kuch nayaa saamne aa rahaa he
 Now, there has been such a disclosure, which will help the Mumbai Police in solving the case
 ab siddharth das naam kaa wo shaks media se ru-ba-rou hua jisane indrani ke ateet kaa wo raaj saamne laa diya jis par indrani mukherjee ne saalon se pardaa daal rakhaa tha
 Siddharth revealed that he is the father of Sheena and Mikhail, but also told that he and Indrani had never married
 darasal wo donon teen saal tak liv-in relationships main saath rahe or isi dauraan pehle shina or phir mikhail kaa janm hua or wo is baat ko sabit karne ke liye diene test karwaane ke liye bhi taiyaar hai
 The great thing is that when Siddharth was asked if Indrani could kill Sheena, in response to this question, Siddharth said, "yes, it could be that she was money minded and said that if Indrani killed Sheena
 Then he should be hanged
 ' siddharth das philhal kolkata ke damdam ilaake ke durganagar main ek kiraye ke makaan main rahete hai
 He is married to a woman named Babli Das
 siddharth ke mutabik wo badanaami kii vajah se abhi tak media ke saamne nahin aae the lekin ab agar mumbai police unase is cese kii tafteesh ke silsile main poochtacha karnaa chaahati he to wo uskaa puraa sahyog karenge
 The entire foundation of the Sheena murder case rests on parts of the human corpse recovered from Raigad
 lekin agar diene shina kaa naa niklaa to zaahir he puraa cese khatm
 This is the reason why the Mumbai Police is eagerly waiting for the deann report
 darasal facial superimpozishan or digital facial impojishan aisi aadhunik takanic he jiske jariye lab main kisi bhi insaani khopadi ko uski shakl di ja sakati he
 The only condition is that a photograph of the person suspected of death is present with the forensic experts for matching
 nejal index yani naak kii banaavat, facial index yani chehre kii banaavat, ai index yani aankh kii banaavat, glabela index yani lalaat kii banaavat or jaaysion yani chehre kii chaudaai kaa gaharaai se adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Two-dimensional or three-dimensional techniques are used in forensic science to reconstruct the face of any person
 dwi aayam yaa tu diemensional takanic main us shaks kii marane se pehle kii tasviir yaa phir sir kii khopadi ke radiograph kii sahaayta se us shaks kaa cheharaa dobaaraa banaaya jaataa he
 In the three-dimension or three-dimensional technique, the face of the dead man's skull, ie, pieces of the head bone is made or his face is also modeled from clay or his face image is made on the computer
 is
 forensik sains main superimpozishan takanic kaa istemaal hameshaa nahin hota kyonki is takanic main kisi kaa bhi cheharaa banane vaale ke paas marane vaale kii haddiyon ke dhaanche kii kuch jaankaree hona jaruri he
 This is usually seen in movies or read only in novels, but now the police themselves have been surprised to hear what has come out in the Sheena Bora murder case
 shina kii maa indrani apni beti kaa katl karne ke baad uski laash car kii pichhali seat par kuch aise bithakar kar le gai thi, jaise wo koi laash nahin, balki jinda ladki ho or seat par so rahi ho
 The corpse did not fall off the seat, so Sheena was holding it on one side and her ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna on the other side and driver Shyamvar kept driving quietly
 phir tayshuda jagah par yani raigarh ke jangalon main pahunchane ke baad teenon ne car se laash nikaali, akad chuki laash ko betaratib tareeke se shootakes main bharaa or phir petrol daal kar aag laga di
 According to the police, Indrani and Khanna along with the driver Shyamvar had strangled Sheena on the previous evening and kept the corpse hidden in her car's car overnight
 teenon ne laash ke saath aisa isliye kiya, taaki raste main nakaabandi ke dauraan kabhi kisi police vaale kii nazar laash par padane par bhi use shaq naa ho
 On this attitude of the Attorney General, the Supreme Court had said in a sharp tone that where were the days when the court gave its decision regarding BCCI and the Lodha Committee gave its recommendations
 centre kii ore se AG ne kaha tha ki ham vichaar kar rahe hai ki sabhi khelon ke liye ek kanoon banaaya jaae
 He said that we want all the associations to have autonomy
 baad main supreme court ne prashaskon kii niyukti 30 janvari tak taal di thi
 The court had asked the BCCI to give three names in sealed envelopes which will take part in the International Cricket Council (ICC) meeting in February
 gauratlab he ki bhartiya cricket control board (BCCI) main sudhaaron ko lekar supreme court sakht rukh akhriyaar kar chukaa he
 The court had clearly told the BCCI that it would have to implement the reforms of the Lodha Committee
 sheersh adaalat ne yah bhi kaha ki hamaara vaqt barabaad na karen or justise lodha cameti kii maane
 The Supreme Court later postponed the appointment of administrators till January 30
 adaalat ne bisisiai se silband lipaphe main teen naam dene ko kaha tha jo farvari main international cricket council (ICC) kii baithak main hissaa lenge
 Significantly, the Supreme Court has taken a strong stand on reforms in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)
 court ne bisisiai se saaf kaha tha ki use lodha cameti ke sudhaar lagu karne hi honge
 The apex court also said that we should not waste our time and obey the Justice Lodha Committee

 Let me tell you that Kumar has been convicted in the Raj Nagar area of delhi Cantonment on November 2, 1984, in the case of killing five Sikhs and setting fire to a gurdwara
 31 oktober 1984 ko tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad sikh virdohi dange hue the
 Apart from Sajjan Kumar, former mlas Krishna Khokhar and Mahendra Yadav also surrendered on 31 December after being convicted
 donon ko 10 saal jail kii sajaa sunai gai he
 Both of them have been convicted in the same case in which former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar has been sentenced to death
 court dwaara khokhar or yadav kaa aatmasamarpan kaa anurodh sweekaar karne ke baad donon ne metropolitan magistrate aditi garg ke samaksh samarpan kiya tha
 Election colors have also started appearing with the admission to DU
 skool kii boring unifarm se nikalakar college kii rang-birangi duniya main kadam rakhane vaale chaatr college ke pehle din kaaphi excited najar aae
 There was a lot of movement in the North Campus since morning
 pasandida college or course milane se chaatro ke liye college kaa pehla din yaadgaar rahaa
 In most colleges, orientation programs were organized on the first day of the session
 nae seshan ke saath shuru hua DUSU kaa dangal
 
 
 With the introduction of the new session, student politics also started gaining momentum in the campus
 abivipi or enesayuai jaise chaatr sanghathan freshars kaa tilak lagaakar, chocolates baantkar or phool se swaagat karte dikhe
 NSUI posters dominated the campus's Wall of Democracy, while the ABVP was seen to welcome students inside the colleges
 haalanki enesayuai ke chaatr bhi collejon main freshars kaa swaagat karne main jute rahe lekin youth congress ke sansad gheraav kii vajah se iskaa koi bada chaatr netaa campus main najar nahin aayaa
 No Welcome Plan of 'CYSS' and 'AAP'
 
 
 punjab kii siyasat ne sivaieses ko students se dur kar diya he
 At the beginning of the new season last year, the Aam Aadmi Party had prepared a big welcome plan to welcome the freshers
 kya netaa, kya mantri or kya violentier
 CYSS was engaged in ensuring victory in DUSU by giving roses and pens to the freshers at the gates of all colleges
 lekin is baar campus main freshars kaa welcome to dur, chaatro kii samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye bhi CYSS ke chaatr najar nahin aae
 There was no CYSS worker present at the gate at Ramjas where Alka Lamba was distributing flowers to freshers last time
 ABVP or NSUI ne kaha, maukaparast he CYSS
 
 
 CYSS had promised to remain active in the campus even after the previous election was held, but in the wake of the Punjab elections, it is now less visible in the candidate campus
 darasal party ne puri takat punjab chunaav jeetne main jhonk di he lihaaja pichley saal puure laav-lashkar ke saath diu freshars kaa welcome karne vaali aam aadmi party is saal campus se nadaarad he

 2ji ghotaale par nae khulaasaaon kaa daur abhi thama nahin he
 a claim by former Cabinet Secretary KM Chandrasekhar has created a stir again in the political corridors
 purv cabinet sachiv keem chandrashekhar ne khulaasa he kiya ki unhone pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko 2ji spectrum ke liye pravesh shulk ooncha rakhane kaa suzav diya tha
 According to his suggestion, the government would have got a revenue of Rs 35,000 crore, which is four times more than the total revenue actually achieved
 2ji kii jaanch main milegi madadchandrashekhar ne 2ji spectrum ghotaale kii jaanch kar rahi sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) ke samaksh kaha ki unhone pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko 4 disambar, 2007 ko patr likhakar yah suzav diya tha
 BJP members boycotted the JPC meeting
 chandrashekhar june, 2007 se june, 2011 tak cabinet sachiv rahe
 He said that the Prime Minister had asked him to assess the financial impact of trai's recommendations on 2G spectrum allocation
 is bare main media main ai khabaron tathaa pradhanmantri karyaalay ko mili patron ke baad yah nirdesh mila tha
 JPC Chairman PC Chacko, after churning out the revenue loss, said, "chandrasekhar probably suggested the possibility of increasing the entry fee in view of increasing phone density, inflation and consumer base

 The Congress's vote, most notably, appears to be an attempt to save the industry houses that had a share in the 2G spectrum allocation on the back of the bjp's demand to call the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister in front of the JPC probing the twog case
 congress ke pravaktaa manish tiwari ne kaha, ‘jepisi main chhot kaa dayera 1998 se 2009 tak badha he
