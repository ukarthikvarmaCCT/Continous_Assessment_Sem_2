 asahneeya pidaa main puri raat railway trek par gujaarne vaali arunima ko is ghatana main apana ek pair ganvaana padaa or unke duusare pair main rod lagaai gai
 While people spend 4 to 5 years in recovery after such a tragic accident, Arunima, while maintaining her passion as a player, conquered the world's highest place, Mount Everest, within just two years of the incident
 Had taken duniya kii sabase oonchi parvat chotii par chadhaai karne vaali pehali aapng mahila parvatarohi banane kaa itihaas unke hi naam likhaa jayega
 First left home, then begged to be sought, now this passion of Jajarunima, the country's first transgender, is not only the story of a woman climbing the world's highest peak, but also the story of her unwavering faith, on which she forced herself into despair

 It is also difficult to move in the condition that Arunima was after the accident

 They got sponsors, their journey started and then the day also came when the floor was destroyed
 arunima ne kaha ki is koshish ke dauraan unke pairon se khun bahata rahata tha or akasar vah gir bhi jaati thim
 People called her crazy and she felt that she would never succeed in her goal

 Justices Arun Mishra and Justice Deepak Gupta heard the bench
 gautam navalkha ke vakil abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha ki janvari 2018 main jab exiaar hui thi usamen gautam navalkha kaa naam nahin he
 His arrest has been stayed by the court since August 2018, but since then, the police have not questioned him
 gautam navalkha hinsa ke kilaaf hai
 He is not a member of the CPI Maoist
 sirf kuch zabt kaagazaat ke aadhaar par karrwai kii gai he
 Singhvi demanded from the court that the protection given to the court by Gautam Navlakha should be increased, so the court ordered that no arrest should be made while the matter is on trial
 justise arun mishra ne kaha ki zamaanat dena or exiaar radd karnaa donon alag-alag maamle hai
 Referring to the provisions of the UAPA, Justice Mishra said that it is not necessary to be a member of the banned organization
 yadi koi aise sanghathan kii sahaayta detaa he to vah UAPA ke tahat apradhi ho saktaa he
 The Maharashtra government has opposed Gautam Navlakha's petition
 rajya ke sarkari vakil ne kaha ki navalkha ke kilaaf paryaapt saboot hai
 On this, Justice Mishra said that the evidence which has been found should be presented before the court
 is maamle main agali sunwaayee 15 aktubar ko hogi
 It is important to mention a detailed decision of the Supreme Court regarding mob litching
 16 july 2018 ko supreme court main mob linching ke bare main aadesh dekar zile se lekar rajdhani ke str par mob linching ko rokane ke liye police kii puri javabdehi tay kii thi
 Simultaneously, the court said that the central and state government should spread on radio, TV and official sites that the punishment for mob lynching and mob violence is very strong
 soshal media par bheed ko uksaane vaale gair javabdeh vaali saamagree hataai jaae
 There should be an FIR against those who are doing this work
 pehle to isi kii samiksha honi chahie ki bheed kii hinsa ko rokane ke liye kend or rajya sarkaron ne radio tivi yaa akhbaar main kya prachaar prasar kiya
 Have you seen any such campaign or seen an advertisement
 ab isi sandarbh main un 49 logon ke patr ko dekhie jo pradhanmantri ko likhaa gaya tha
 The authors of the letter have described themselves as supporters of peace and an appeal has been made to the Prime Minister to immediately stop the lynching of Muslims, Dalits or other minorities
 ab aap bataaiye
 Were these 49 people writing letters and doing any criminal work? But even after this, an FIR has been lodged against Muzaffarpur in Bihar
 in logon par rashtradoh, dharmik aasthaa bhadakaane, shanti bhang karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 Is it an attempt to warn people against mob lynchings, write letters to the Prime Minister or anyone, to incite religious faith, is this work national, some of those who write letters are very old
 84 saal ke shyaam benegal hai jinhone samvidhan par rajyasabha ke liye shandaar episod banaae hai
 Shyam Benegal received the 2005 Dadasaheb Phalke Award
 84 saal ke saumitr chatarji hai
 Saumitra Chatterjee received the 2011 Dadasaheb Phalke Award
 78 saal ke adur gopal krishnan ko 2004 main dada sahab phalke award mila he
 80-year history professor Sumit Sarkar is named
 duniya bhar main inkaa naam he
 When 80-84-year-old writer, filmmaker, historian started threatening the country or even speaking, no one can bear it
 sumit sarkaar kii kitaab ratta maakar na jane kitne iees, ipies bane honge
 They cannot throw a stone and are accused of treason
 82 saal ke samaaj vigyaani ashish nandi pradhanmantri ko patr likhakar rashtradoh kar sakate hai
 When did Ramchand Guha, who regularly writes in many newspapers in India, become a traitor, by writing just one letter
 jinaki kitaab na jane kitne gharon main rakhi hogi
 Will they also become antinational one day
 shubha mudgal, partha chatarji, naveen kishor, 'roza' film banane vaale maniratnam
 The language of the letter written by these 49 people to the Prime Minister is also Shalin
 balki unhen yaad dilaayaa gaya ki sansad main pradhanmantri ne bhi mob liching kii aalochana kii thi magar yah kaaphi nahin he
 Action must be taken against those who do so
 loktantr main asahmati zaruri he
 Those with intolerance should not be called anti nationals
 iske baad bhi exiaar darj kii gai he
 This comes after the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate of FIR Muzaffarpur
 jab aap khud jarjar ho jate hai to hawa ke jhoken se bhi darane lagate hai
 Mob lynching is happening every day
 log maare ja rahe hai
 Those who are not worried should think about what they have become
 unki chuppi ek behatar samaaj kaa nirmaan kar rahi he yaa ve bhi is bheed se dare hue usamen shaamil gum rahe hai
 The question should be why the 70-year and 84-year-old youth, who are 25 years old and 40 years old, have to write letters to protest against mob violence, why they are unable to write letters
 in logon kaa patr likhnaa desh ke naujavaanon ko aainaa bhi dikhaanaa he
 Otherwise when writing a letter to the Prime Minister was a crime

 Chief Justice Pradeep Nadrajog and Justice Bharti Dangre have said that the petition for Vanashakti is not being dismissed on the basis of merit, but it is being done well thinking of what has been called the Principle of commonality in English
 isliye cese ko merit ke aadhaar par khaarij nahin kiya gaya kyonki yah masalaa neshnal green tribunel or supreme court main bhi chal rahaa he
 There were many demonstrations in Mumbai to stop the cutting of these trees
 ek lakh logon ne online yachika di thi
 The court said that the summary of the talk of these one lakh people had been presented, so it would not be right to say that the objection of one lakh people was not considered
 faisle main likhaa he ki project vaale ne sanjay gandhi rashtriya udyaan main jeepies tanging ke saath 20,900 saowling lagaae hai jinamein se 95 pratishat ped batch gaye hai
 The court said that seven times more sapling has been installed than that to be dropped and this work has been done two years ago
 is project ko sanyukt raashtra kii fremawork for climet change main panjikrut he to videshi agenciyaan bhi paryaavana ke asar par nazar rakh rahi hai
 But the petitioners are not satisfied, they are talking about going to the Supreme Court

 For the past few years, Shahrukh Khan's films have not been able to make a mark at the box office
 haalanki unke production kii filmein kamai kar rahi hai
 In such a situation, Bollywood actor and producer Kamal r Khan has told what is the reason that Shahrukh Khan's films are not playing
 KRK ne twit karke poocha ki kyon pichley 5 saalon main shahrukh(shahrukh Khan) ek bhi hit film nahin de sake
 Asking some questions in the next line, Kamaal r Khan wrote whether SRK is a big superstar, yes
 
 
 kya shahrukh (shahrukh Khan) ek achche kalakaar hai, haa
 
 
 Is Shahrukh a good business man, yes
 
 
 kya,shahrukh ko lagata he ki acchhee film banane ke liye unhen sab maaloom he, nahin! or yahi to samasya he
 Why SRK is not able to give a hit film during last 5 years? SRK is a big super star- yes! SRK is a good actor- yes! SRK is a gud businesman-yes SRK thinks that he knows all to make a good film- Not! And this is the problem!!kul milakar kamaal aar khan(kamaal r Khan) kaa kahana he ki shahrukh(shahrukh Khan) ko lagata he ki unhen ek hit film banane ke liye sabakuch mamul he lekin aisa nahin he
 At the same time, many fans have agreed with Kamal r Khan, expressing their reaction to this tweet of Kamal r Khan
 ek yujar ne kaha ki shahrukh ke saath hit filmon ke diarector bhi flop ho chuke hai, jaise ki film dilavaale main rohit shetty or jab harry met sejal film main imtiyaaj ali
 It is obvious that Shah Rukh Khan's Die Heart Fans must have been angry with this thing of Kamaal r Khan
 isaki baangi kamaal aar khan ke twitor acount ke riplai box main dekhi ja sakati he
 On this tweet by Kamal r Khan, the fans of SRK have instructed KRK to first bring a good film for themselves and then teach someone
 to ek yujar ne likhaa ki abhi tumhaari haisiyat nahin ki tum bollywood ke king (shahrukh Khan) ko naseehat do

 'friends Friends' is a story written by Krishna Sobti which occurs in a common middle-class family
 vah 'mitro' ke bahaane stri ko uski ichchhaaon ke liye jeene, jujhane or ladane kaa hathiyaar detii hai
 Friends gave a character who loves himself and does not hesitate to fulfill his wishes
 vah apane adhikaron ke liye bolti bhi he, jhagadati bhi
 She wants to live for herself, but her desires remain subdued
 bollywood kii kai filmein isi vishay par bani ki aakhir ek mahila apane 'sex dijair' kaa kya kare
 Why a woman's body was buried in the name of Nari Shuchita? Rajkamal Prakashan published 'mitro Marjani' novel
 iske ab tak nau sanskaran nikal chuke hai
 Today when Krishna is not sobering, then for the readers of Sahitya Aaj Tak, the excerpt from the same book: xxrep 4 * appeared before Phoolavanti's door, so she started flirting
 jhaankakar awaz di- aaj to, phulavanthi, tu bade rangon main! teri to taaji-taaji ilaychi daanevaali maala ghadakar ai he
 Phoolawanti pressed her tongue under her teeth
 barin kahan se pataa paa gai? haath kaa kaseeda chhod dahalij par aan khadi hui- tumhaara hi munh mubarak ho, jithaani! ilaychi dane kii koun kahe, is ghar to fata challa bhi dawaal nahin!manjhali kuulhe mataka hans di- vaah ri bahan ferebavanti! is kaljug main to puja hi goud-gadant kii to tu hi kyon sach bole
 Chhotki Mala is in your thief and the mother-in-law's trick! Thousands of women, but who does not know how to handle the jewels of a woman? Ari, even if you hide the rosary of magic in the garland, you can still see the mantra with friends
 sunakar phulaan ko jag-jahaan bhul gaya
 Then, fearing that Jithani might not really understand that i had fallen behind, she came out and followed friends to the kitchen
 mitro chauke main ja baithi or saas ko sunaakar boli- maan ji, bechaari phulavanthi par buree ban ai he, chaav-chaav gahanaa-gatta ghadva jo abhaagin dushmano ke dar se ang na chhua sake
 
 
 Dhanwanti, who was already burnt by Gulzari and her housewife, blushed in the stove and said to her, daughter-in-law, i do not move the jewel-bag, but what the jewelery of the family began to understand, what did the jewelry of the Bhagmaris also bear? - Will you bloom? Foolawanti was afraid of her mouth, but could not live listening to her mother-in-law
 tyori chadha boli- foolen-falein ve jinka is ghar hukum hasal he! jin ham-jaison ke bhaag hi khote hon, jo abhaage sabase chote hon, unka to prabhu hi vaali! din-bhar chulhaa-chaukaa jhonk shaam ko bachi-khuchi rotiyaan, itnaa hi na!dhanavanti ne haath mel-mel liye- dar kar bahu, koi upar bhi dekhanevaala he!phir mitro kii ore mudakar kaha- manjhali bahu ! main to naate se hi buree isaki saas thahari par tu meri saunh khaakar kah de, is naajo ko is rasoighar kii raah-dagar bhi pataa he?manjhali ne titakaari bhari- palang par baithe-bithaae jise changa-chosa mil jaae, maan ji, vah nigodi chauke main kyon munh maarane aegi ?phulavanthi sar maar-maar uchhali- thik kahati ho, maan ji, thik hi! is chauke main meri kya puch? puch he unki jinke khasm mehnat se kamaate hai, maheene main das baar gaffe laate hai!saas kii kachi hote dekh manjhali kaa dil pighla
 Pulled from his arm, i got sit on the fruit and got a chin and said - My disinterested lover! Where does it lie, Ri? Don't i know Belly Goldsmith? You made her jewelery half of the jewelery half-hearted, but say this, where does the naive farbon earn your money? Where did you hear the rage? kaha- devar tumhaara kahin send lagaataa ho, daake daalata ho, so jaane uske maan-baap or bhai-bhaujai
 
 
 Then when the attention was paid to the mother-in-law in the forehead, i added further - whatever you ask for the jewel ornaments, whatever i can get from the piara, i will tie it up and make something of it
 manjhali kuch kehane jaati thi ki chauke ke baahar gharavaale ko khadaa dekh muskaraai or phulavanthi ke sir kaa ghunghat neeche khinch boli- ari devraani, kuch hosh kar! jeth khadaa he

 As we overtook the Range Rover, they started firing in the air to stop us
 phir unhone hamen jor jabardastee karke car se baahar nikaala or hamen maarane lage
 When we started running from there, one of them fired at my friend who started going

 There is no fever and pain that you go to the drugstore and ask for paracetamol directly, which is sold under many different names

 yani prati ton paracitamol par ayaatkon ko 50 hajaar rupee chukaane honge
 By importing bulk drugs, most companies make paracetamol tablets that you buy

 The argument that Swamy is giving is the same with respect to vigilance inquiry
 lekin, is cese main visilence inquairi bhi ab nahin hogi kyonki court ne chargeshit par sangyaan le liya he

 But the truth is also that the Delhi High Court had dismissed Swamy's PIL on this matter and said that it was not a PIL (public Interest Litigation) but a Political Interest Litigation was filed
 is par swami kya kahenge
 Shashi Tharoor's lawyer said that if a third party goes to the Supreme Court, then the Supreme Court dismisses his petition and says that the third party has no right
 swami ke paas koi locas nahin he
 If the court will allow the owner to assist, then the condition of all the courts in the country will deteriorate

 Apart from this, they have to pay less salary to foreign businessmen than Americans
 vahiin, trump or unke is sangrakshanvaadi niti ke samarthakon kaa kahana he ki companiyon kii yah daleel sach nahin he
 The purpose of this order of Trump is not to stop foreign talent from coming to America, but to prevent its misuse

 Low-skilled employees will be most affected by Trump's orders
 is vija kaa bade paimaane par istemaal bhartiya iti profeshnal dwaara kiya jaataa he

 Most of these infants were brought from remote areas in very critical condition

 The political assembly of Delhi assembly elections has been laid
 sabhi badi raajnneetik partiyaan lagaataar apane pattey khol rahi hai
 Voters have a dilemma as to which party they should vote for, which will develop Delhi and ultimately benefit them as well
 aisi kai baaten hai, jo bijepi kii ore se siem pad kii ummidavaar kiran bedi or AAP ke siem pad ke daavedaar arvind kejariwal ke paksh main jaati hai
 But this does not mean that Congress and Ajay Maken are not in the race or there is a shortage of those who want them in Delhi
 aise kai tathy hai, jo congress or maakan ke paksh main jate hai
 Here are such things, on the basis of which i will vote for Ajay Maken
 
 
 1
 The Congress prepared the lifeline of Delhi, even though the pace of Delhi was not less than decades ago, but it has been done by the Congress to give wings to this pace
 dilli metro kaa khaakaa taiyaar karne se lekar use patariyon main daudane kaa puraa credit congress sarkaar ko hi jaataa he
 There will hardly be anyone who travels in the metro, who can ignore this unique gift of this Congress
 bason or kaaron ke liye sienji bhi congress raaj kii hi uplabdhi he
 Read
 
 
 main kejariwal ko vot duungaa kyonki
 
 
 2
 dilli main vikaas kaa shrey congress kopichley kareeb dedh dashakon main dilli main vikaas karne kaa puraa credit congress ko hi jaataa he
 Congress can rely on the name of public development
 emsidi main congress kaa kabja na hone ke baavjood usne dilli main behatar kaam kar dikhaaya
 The Congress began to implement the task of regulating colonies on a large scale
 padhein-main kiran bedi ko vot duungaa, kyonki
 
 
 3
 ajay maakan kii saaf chhavi kaa phydajay maakan aise netaa hai, jinaki image saaf-suthri he
 There is no allegation of corruption etc
 against him
 khel mantri ke rup main unka record badhiya rahaa he
 So they can draw voters towards them
 4
 Maken can also attract youth: Ajay Maken himself is an enthusiastic youth leader, so the youth of Delhi can woo voters
 ve AAP netaa arvind kejariwal or bijepi netaa kiran bedi ko is morche par bhi takkar de sakate hai
 5
 maakan ne pesh kiya teesraa vikalpadilli main pehle to arvind kejariwal or kiran bedi ke bich hi puraa muqabla maaloom pad rahaa tha
 But Ajay Maken's entry into the electoral fray gives voters a third strong option
 6
 Maken gains confidence of Congress leadershipajay Maken is considered close to Congress leadership, which has full support and trust of high command
 aise main voter inhen palkon par bitha sakate hai
 7
 samvaad karne main maahir hai makanjay maakan public se samvaad karne main maahir maane jate hai
 Live on mediums like Facebook, Twitter
 kisi bhi mudde par turant apni raay dete hai
 These things go in his favor
 8
 The Congress met its promise when no party got a majority in Delhi's last assembly elections, the Congress went ahead and supported the AAP, which led to the formation of the government
 congress ne vaada kiya tha ki vah kejariwal sarkaar se samarthan waapas nahin legi
 He kept his promise, which is a big thing in this era's politics
 9
 Everyone's party is the Congress Congress who is credited with making the country
 yah aisi party he, jahaan har dharm or jati ke logon kii puch hoti he
 The public knows that it is everyone's party
 congress ko is image kaa phayda mil saktaa he
 10
 
 
 
 Because Maken believes in the system, Arvind Kejriwal entered politics later, by creating a movement against the country's poor political system
 kiran bedi ipies chhodane ke baad samajaseva se jud gayi
 But Ajay Maken is a political politician
 maakan ko vot isliye milegaa, kyonki ve raajnneeti or system main bharosa rakhte hai

 24 farvari ko hone vaala kolaras or mungawali vidhansabha siton kaa upachunaav sambhawatah purv rajshahi ke bich mukaable main badal gaya he
 Both the constituencies are in the Guna parliamentary seat, represented by Jyotiraditya Scindia, which has been the center of the Gwalior State
 kolaras shivpuri vidhansabha kshetra ke saath bhi judaa hua he, jahaan kaa pratinidhitiv unki buaa or shivaraj singh chouhan kii aguai vaali bhaajapa sarkaar main khel mantri yashodhara raaje kar rahi hai
 All the top Congress leaders of the state, while presenting a picture of solidarity, showed support for the party candidate while filing the nomination on 31 January
 haalanki is kshetra ko sindhiya kaa sabase priy mana jaataa he
 The royal descendants have established their camp at Shivpuri and have expressed their intention to monitor the by-elections from there
 donon ummidavaaron—mahendra singh yadav or brajendra singh yadav kaa chayan sindhiya ne hi kiya he
 Both these bouts are being seen as a proxy battle between Chief Minister Chauhan and Scindia, as Scindia is likely to be the Congress's chief ministerial candidate in the state assembly elections to be held in November this year
 yah bahut kuch chouhan dwaara laae gaye jaybhaan singh pavaiya or prabhaat jha jaise 'mahal virdohi' netaaon (rajshahi gharaane ke virdohi netaaon) ke kaaran tha
 Then on the eve of nomination, the change was made and on 5 February Devendra Jain filled his nomination and Raje was asked to take his nephew on target
 khel mantri shivpuri aa gayi or bhaajapa ke ummidavaar ke liye jor-shor se prachaar karne lageen
 Like the recent by-elections held in neighboring Rajasthan, the results of Madhya Pradesh are expected to prepare the ground for the assembly elections to be held in November
 chunki daanv bahut ooncha he, isliye sattarudh bhaajapa ne sara jor laga diya he—party ke chunaav prachaar ko chalaane ke liye aath cabinet mantriyon ko lagaaya gaya he
 Before the notification of the by-election was issued, Chief Minister Chouhan started campaigning in Kolaras and Mungavali on his behalf and announced announcements of new schemes for the benefit of the people
 haal hi main cabinet main hue pherbadal main in donon nirvachan kshetron ke obisi matadaataaon ko khush karne kii koshish ke rup main dekha gaya
 But if the Congress continues to celebrate its victory in the Ater and Chitrakoot by-elections of April and November 2017, then the bjp's difficulty will increase
 bhagava party ke bheetar hi virodhiyon ne rajya main mukhyamantri kii lokapriyata par sawaal uthaane shuru kar die hai
 a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, on the condition of anonymity, said, "it will be like failing the test before the board exam
" mukhya pariksha se pehle aapke paas sudhaar karne ke liye kadam uthaane kaa samay nahin bachaa he
 But Jyotiraditya Scindia has a better chance than Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 upachunaav kaa parinaam chaahe jo bhi ho, is maamle main vijeta nishchit taur par koi sindhiya hi hoga

 ' The celebrations of Diwali have started
 dukaanon ko dulhan kii tarah sajaayaa ja rahaa he lekin is saal bhi offis se chuttee nahin milane ke kaaran apane ghar nahin ja rahi hum
 Last year was also away from home
 mujhe yaad he ki pichley saal diwali ke ek din pehle se hi maa lagaataar phone kiye ja rahi thi, 'betaa lakshmi or ganesh ji kii murti kharid lenaa, laddu badhiya laana, koi nayaa kapadaa kharida yaa nahin, offis main chuttee to denge na, doston ko apane ghar bula lenaa
 
 
 
 vagairah
 If i start writing about the whole list, it will probably never end
 'thik diwali ke din maine ghar main to bataa diya ki offis main chuttee he, jabaki chuttee nahin thi
 i did not even have the courage to ask for a vacation because of getting a new job and the biggest thing is that no one would celebrate Diwali on the day of being so far away from home in the rented room, so i felt better going to the office
 offis main bhi us din kuch khaas kaam nahin tha, isliye baar-baar man main yahi khyaal aata rahaa he ki kya matlab he aisi jindagi or aise paise kaa jisamen aap parivaar ke saath khushiyaan manaane ke liye bhi ikattha na ho saken
 i left the office and stood at the lost bus stand for a long time
 jab ek ghanta biit jane ke baavjood bas nahin ai to maine auto rukvaaya or baith gai
 i habitually ask every auto person where he is from
 yahi kaam maine yahaan bhi kiya
 All i asked was, 'brother, where are you from, do not go home in Diwali
 'iske baad to us autowale ne ek lanbaa lacture tyohaar, train or bihar par de daalaa
 But he had a point
 vah ek aam bihari kii tarah tha, jo dilli behatar jindagi kii talash main aata he magar yahaan kii bheed main khokar rah jaataa he
 He said something like, 'madam, will you go home on Diwali, when there are clothes, sweets and crackers money for children and wife in the pocket, i have nothing here, Chhath is coming from the top
 isliye kisi se 2 hajaar rupee udhaar lekar ghar bhej die
 i did not go
 ab kamaane ke liye baahar nikle hai to kya diwali or kya chhath
 The government there does not mind anything
 main to kahata hum ki in tyoharon ko bhi khatm ho janaa chahie kyonki ise manaane ke liye bhi to paise chahie hote hai
 'hearing his words, it felt as if a traveler could understand the matter of settling down from the village and settling here
 srilankai cricket team ko group-e ke duusare match main haraane ke baad manobal se loverej pakistani team guuruuvaar ko premdasa stadium main hone vaale apane tisare match main canada se bhidegi
 Given the stature of both teams, the match is expected to be one-sided
 pakistan ne ab tak khele gaye do match jite hai jabaki canada ko do maichon main haar mili he
 Sri Lanka, who defeated Kenya by a huge margin on Tuesday, have moved up to the first place in the group-b table by scoring four points from three matches but Pakistan have a chance to go above that by defeating Canada
 pakistani team jeet ke madhyam se ank batorne ke alaava apana net ran rate bhi sudhaarna chaahegi, jo aane vaale vakt main uske kaaphi kaam aayega
 Currently, he is slightly behind Sri Lanka in terms of net run rate
 uski sthiti haalanki austrailia se kaaphi acchhee he
 Pakistan defeated Kenya by a margin of 205 runs in their first match, while in the second match they defeated Sri Lanka by 11 runs in a thrilling match
 srilanka apane pehle match main canada ko 210 ranon se haraa chukaa he jabaki canada ko zimbabwe ke haathon bhi 175 ranon se haar mili thi
 Shahid Afridi, who is improving match by match, has no similarity in terms of strength between the Pakistani team and the weak Canadian team
 apane group kii sabase kamjor team ke taur par canadai khilaadi pakistan ke khilaaf kuch khaas karne kaa prayaas karenge, jo netherlands ko chhodkar abhi tak kisi sambaddh team nahin kar pai he
 In the Rajya Sabha on the fourth day of the budget session, there was a serious discussion on the occasion of International Women's Day
 beete din tak hangaame kii bhent chadh chuke satr main aaj sabhi saansadon ne ekajute hokar mahilaon ke mudde par charchaa kii
 From the reservation of women in the House, the emphasis was on protecting women and protecting their rights
 rajyasabha main charchaa ke dauraan bijepi saansad subramanyam swami me kisi mahila sadsy ko sabhapati ke panel main shaamil karne kii maang
 He also referred to mythology and said that the example of women's empowerment is seen in the cabin of Brahma
 bhagwaan brahma kaa hawala dete hue swami ne kaha ki unki cabinet main sabhiiham vibhagamahilaon ke hi paas the
 As Lakshmi was handling the Finance Department, the Defense Department was with Durga and the Education Department with Saraswati
 unhone kaha ki us dauraan sirf soochna prasaaran vibhaag kaa jimmaa ek purush yani naarad muni ko saunpa gaya tha
 Taking up his demand, Swamy said that in the last 70 years, the country has not got a single female cabinet secretary
 aise main meri apil he ki is pad par bhi kisi mahila ko baithaaya jaae
 Swamy said that atrocities or discrimination with women is not a part of our culture
 saath hi unhone kaha ki itihaas main bhi do baar mahila asmita kii raksha ke liye yuddh hue hai phir chaahe wo mahabharat main draupadi hon yaa phir ramayana main sita or hamaari samskruti kaa hissaa he
 The women were congratulated by the House on International Women's Day in the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha on Thursday

 raina ne is world cap main ab tak do abhyaas maichon sahit chaar maichon main 41, 54, naabad 35 or naabad 4 ran banaae hai
 He attributed this success to tips from Ganguly
 suresh par kabhi shaq nahin thaganguli ne mangalvaar ko ek saakshaatkaar main kaha, mujhe suresh kii pratibha or yogyata par kabhi shaq nahin tha
 He always did well in the short format
 vah tii20 kaa khatarnaak ballebaaj he or kisi bhi virdohi team ke liye bada khatra ban saktaa he
 i am confident that he will retain the current form of the ICC World T20 in major tournaments as well
 unhone kaha, aage chunautiyaan kaaphi kadi hai
 He said, India is to play in England tour, Australia tour and World Cup from July to September
 main chahta hum ki use in shrinkhalaaon main bhi safalataa mili
 Can't tell what Raina said to Ganguly, what technical advice he gave to Raina
 unhone kaha, haa meri suresh se baat hui thi, lekin maine usase bahut nijee baaten kii or main use media ko nahin bataa saktaa
 He is my companion and if he ever needs my help, then it is my duty to provide him help
 ganguli boli, jo bhi meri salaah chahta he, main hameshaa uske liye taiyaar rahata hum or main isko lekar ho hallaa nahin machaana chahta
 Yuvraj's Dilasaganguli was initially mentor to Yuvraj Singh and believes that the left-handed batsman should not worry about the poor form

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne vipaksh ko vikaas or kisaan-garib virdohi qaraar dete hue guuruuvaar ko kisaanon kaa aahvaan kiya ki ve vikaas kaa virodh karne waalon ke khilaaf uth khadey hon
 He termed the proposed land acquisition law of the central government as necessary for development
 madhya pradesh ke khandwa jile main guuruuvaar ko singhaji taap vidyut ghar kii ek ikai kaa locarpan or bhumipujan samaaroh ke maukey par jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki vikaas ke liye jameen kii jarurat hoti he, jiske liye vah bhoomi adhigrahan sambandhi pichley kanoon main kuch badlaav laana chaahate hai, lekin rajyasabha main bahumat nahin hone ke kaaran vah aisa nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Modi said that the government which was in place for the last 10 years enacted a law that cannot provide land for roads, canals, hospitals, schools
 unhone kaha ki unki sarkaar chaahati he ki kisaanon or garibon ke bachche skulon main pard saken, unke ilaaj ke liye aspataal hon, sinchai ke liye nahar bane or rojgaar ke avasar uplabdh hon, unhen rojgaar dene ke liye udyog sthapit hon
 Keeping these things in mind, he wants to bring some changes in the previous Land Acquisition Act
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki gaanv main rahane vaale kisaanon or garibon kaa vikaas ho, unhen suvidhaayen mili, iske liye jameen kii jarurat he, kyonki aspataal, nahar, skool, udyog aadi aasmaan par to sthapit ho nahin sakate
 He wants the people of the village to get everything close to his village, this is possible only when land is available
 rajyasabha main sankhya bal kam hone kaa hawala dete hue pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki sadan main unke paas bahumat nahin he, virodh karne vaale yah nahin bataate ki kanoon main kya sudhaar karnaa chahie, ve to sirf virodh kar rahe hai
 The central government is ready to discuss all issues
 unhone vipakshiyon se kaha ki ve bahumat ke bal par vikaas main baadha nahin daalen
 Due to their opposition, the children of farmers and poor will not be able to build schools, will not be able to build hospitals, will not get canals, will not get employment, so it is necessary that farmers should stand up against those who oppose development and mislead them

 bahujan samaaj party ne uttar pradesh main samaajavadi party se chunavigathabandhantodane kaa elaan karte hue ye vajah bataai ki sapa ke yadav votaron ne basapa ko vot nahin diya
 But the figures defy this argument of the BSP supremo
 ulte basapa ke vot bank ne sapa pratyaashiyon kii madad nahin kii, ye jarur sabit hota he
 Coalition candidates could not perform well even in the reserved seats of bsp's votebank, at least Mayawati's party seems to be responsible for this
 basapa 2014 main apana khaataa bhi nahin khol saki thi
 Of the 17 reserved seats in UP, only the BSP won Nagina and Lalganj seats
 in donon siton par sapa-basapa ko 2014 ke chunaav main mili voton ko mila diya jaae to 2019 kii jeet kaa saaf taur par purvanumaan jaahir kiya ja saktaa tha or hua bhi thik vaisaa hi
 In the 2019 elections, the SP lost by a margin of 3 lakh votes in 8 places while the BSP had only one seat which showed that the BSP cadre polling in favor of SP was nominal
 sapa 32 siton main duusare sthaan par rahi jabaki basapa 25 siton par
 It is evident that the SP voters voted well in favor of the BSP
 varanaa modi lahar-2 main maaya kii party ke 10 saansad na jitate
 The BSP has won the Ghosi seat by the largest margin
 ghosi loksabhaa kshetra main 2014 ke chunaav main basapa ko 22
 48 percent and SP got 16 percent votes while BJP candidate 36
 5 fisadi vot hasil kar jeet hasil kii thi
 In the 2019 elections, the SP-BSP alliance candidate gave the BJP candidate 1
 2 lakh voton se haraaya or 50 fisadi vot hasil kiye
 This shows that sp's votes were transferred to BSP and the alliance worked
 doosraa, unnav kaa udhaaharan len
 Here SP got 17 in the 2014 elections
 3 fisadi or basapa ko 16
 Samajwadi Party coalition candidate Arun Shukla received 24 per cent votes in 2019
 4 fisadi vot mili jo bataata he ki basapa ke vot sapa ke paksh main nahin pade or pichley chunaav main 43 fisadi vot paane vaale bhaajapa ke sakshi maharaj 2019 main 57 fisadi vot hasil kar jite
 The number of BSP candidates getting 30 to 40 per cent of the vote percentage is 12 while the number of SP candidates was 15, similarly the number of SP candidates getting less than 30 per cent votes was 5
 ye tathy bataate hai ki vot transfar to hue hai or mayawati kii ye daleel sirf fori bahaanaa he gathbandhan todane kaa

 Only Akhilesh Yadav is seen in the video, not his father and party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav or any other party leader
 
 
 donon hi clip ek bete ke 'yoddha' pita kii chhatrachhaaya se baahar nikalne kii gavaahi de rahi hai, or is baat kii bhi ki party kii apil 'yadavon' ke simate hue bakse se baahar tak pahunch chuki he
 
 
 This video is also important in this regard, as there has always been a 'cauldron' of castes and communities in Uttar Pradesh, and no leader or party has ever tried to touch the hearts through this video
 
 
 iskaa netritv kar rahe hai akhilesh, jinhone varsh 2012 se ab tak apane ypad par kaam karte-karte computaron se chidhane vaali samaajawaadee party ko us dal main tabdeel kar diya, jo padhane waalon ko laptop baantati he
 
 
 The video is heard as soon as it starts - "I prepare myself every day to improve the future of Uttar Pradesh
" 
 
 ", or phir dikhaai dete hai naashte kii mez par patni dimple or bacchon ke saath baithe akhilesh yadav
 
 
 The theme of the video is - Family, People, Progress, and finally the message appears - "uttar Pradesh, India
 
 
 meraa parivaar
 
 
 " teen minute se kuch zyaada samay kaa yah video kai ghante kii footage main se chhaant-chhaantkar banaaya gaya he
 
 
 And that footage was taken from many special cameras, including drone cameras, which some experts carried around for several days, along with Akhilesh, and back and forth
 
 
 marcedes esayuvi main savaar hokar mukhyamantri ke karyaalay tak janaa ek aisa drishy he, jo samaajawaadee party ke itihaas se bilkul alag he, kyonki ab tak yahi samajha jaataa rahaa he ki khaadi ko chhodkar agar kuch bhi mahangaa istemaal kiya, to chunaav main baari padegaa
 
 
 After this, Akhilesh, sitting in the gleaming new office, looks somewhat sad, and is looking at the old assembly building right in front of the window
 
 
 rose kiye jane vaale kaamkaaj ke bare main akhilesh ko slo moshan main chalaae gaye kai alag-alag drishyon main vidhyaarthiyon se baatcheet karte, bheed kaa abhivadan karte, media ko sambodhit karte, or yojanaon kaa akalan karte dikhaaya jaataa he
 
 
 Akhilesh Yadav is seen distributing relief material to Muzaffarnagar riot victims in the video, but the issue is not much emphasized, which is somewhat different from Samajwadi Party's 'pro-muslim stance'
 
 
 aamtaur par samaajawaadee party kii apil gramin uttar pradesh tak simit samajhi jaati he, lekin abhiyaan ke liye taiyaar video main shahari ehsaas bhi he, jisase sanket miltaa he ki akhilesh kaa iraadaa shaharon tak bhi pahunch, pahchaan, or prabhaav banane kaa he
 The comments video ke ant main kaam karte mukhyamantri ko unke bachche aakar tokate hai, or vah sab kuch chhodkar unke saath cricket khelnaa shuru kar dete hai
 
 
 This family love is in stark contrast to the bitter 'controversy' that has been going on between Akhilesh and his father and uncle Shivpal Yadav for the past several days
 
 
 prachaar ke liye taiyaar kiye audio kaa asar gramin ilaakon main padane kii zyaada sambhaavna he
 
 
 In this, Mulayam Singh Yadav is included in the pantheon of veteran socialist leaders, and his ideology is described as 'ganga-jamuna' of inspiration
 
 
 koi filmi geet isamen nahin baj rahaa he, balki chunavi jingle bundelkhand ke 'aalha-oodal' ke kisson se prabhavit he
 
 
 Alha and Udal, who were the commanders of the king of Bundelkhand, were born from the womb of a mother who belonged to 'ahir', ie the Yadav community
 
 
 somvaar ko akhilesh unke janmdin par unki badi beti timsi dwaara banaae kek kaa tukdaa chakh rahe the, jab behad chaturaai se vivaadon se pallaa bachaate hue unhone kaha, "main us ghode kii tarah daud shuru kar rahaa hum, jisaki ankhon par blinkar (pattee, jisaki vajah se ghoda sirf sidhaa dekh paata he) bandhe hai
 
 
 i do not see anything other than the upcoming election
 
 
 " Akhilesh Yadav will play the election trumpet on November 3, sitting on a special chariot designed for the election campaign (which is actually a bus that has been modified to suit the need), and will travel several thousand kilometers
 
 
 kis raste par jaakar kin muddon par prachaar kiya jayega, yah abhi gupt rakhaa gaya he
 
 
 Something special has also been prepared for this campaign, which usually does not match the style of Samajwadi Party - a video and an audio
 
 
 video main sirf akhilesh yadav nazar aa rahe hai, unke pita va party pramukh mulaayam singh yadav yaa party kaa koi bhi anya netaa nahin
 
 
 Both clips testify to the exit of the umbrella of the 'warrior' father of a son, and that the party's appeal has reached beyond the confined boxes of the 'yadavas'
 
 
 yah video is lihaaz se bhi mahatvapurn he, kyonki uttar pradesh main hameshaa se jatiyon or samudaayon kii 'kadaahi kholati' rahi he, or kisi bhi netaa yaa party ne is tarah video ke zariye dilon ko chune kii koshish pehle kabhi nahin kii
 
 
 It is headed by Akhilesh, who since 2012, while working on his ipad, transformed the socially teasing Samajwadi Party into a party that distributes laptops to readers
 
 
 video shuru hote hi sunai detaa he - "main har rose uttar pradesh ke bhavishya ko behatar banane ke liye khud ko taiyaar karata hum
 
 
 ", And then appears at the breakfast table with wife Dimple and children Akhilesh Yadav seated
 
 
 video kaa theme he - parivaar, log, pragati, or ant main sandesh dikhataa he - "uttar pradesh, bharat
 
 
 My family
 
 
 " This video, which is longer than three minutes, has been created by truncating several hours of footage
 
 
 or vah footage lee gai thi drone camaron sahit kai khaas camaron se, jinhen kuch visheshgy kai din tak apane saath lekar akhilesh ke saath-saath, or peeche-peeche bhi ghume
 
 
 Riding in a Mercedes SUV to the Chief Minister's office is a scene that is completely different from the history of the Samajwadi Party, as it has been understood till now that if anything expensive is used except Khadi, the election will be overwhelming
 
 
 iske baad chamchamaate nae offis main baithe akhilesh kuch udhaas-se dikhte hai, or khidki se baahar thik saamne maujuud puraane vidhansabha bhawan ko nihaar rahe hai
 
 
 Akhilesh is shown interacting with the students, greeting the crowd, addressing the media, and assessing the plans in a number of different scenes in slow motion about the day-to-day functioning
 
 
 akhilesh yadav video main mujaffarnagar danga peediton ko raahatsaamagree baantate to dikhaai dete hai, lekin is mudde par zyaada jor nahin diya gaya he, jo samaajawaadee party ke 'muslim-samarthak rukh' se kuch alag he
 
 
 The Samajwadi Party's appeal is generally thought to be limited to rural Uttar Pradesh, but the campaign-ready video also has an urban feel, indicating that Akhilesh intends to reach, identify, and influence cities as well
 tippaniyan At the end of the video, the working chief interrupts his children, and he leaves everything and starts playing cricket with them
 
 
 yah paariwarik pyaar us kadavaahat-bhare 'vivaad' se bilkul ulat he, jo pichley kai din se akhilesh or unke pita va chachaa shivpal yadav ke bich jari he

 mumbai ke satorion ne cricket kii tarah dilli vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar bhi bade paimaane par satta lagaaya he, or eggzet pole hi nahin, sattebaajon ke mutabik bhi aam aadmi party hi dilli main sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 Former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's party remains the first choice of bookies, so the Aam Aadmi Party's price is much lower here than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), while the Congress is not open
 satta bazaar main jiskaa bhav kam hota he, uske jeetne ke asaar zyada hote hai
 According to the bookies, the strong position of the Aam Aadmi Party can be gauged from the fact that its price has opened from at least 20 seats, which is 22 paise, while BJP has opened its seat from 15 seats, which is 32 paise
 isi tarah aam aadmi party ko 25 siten milane par 42 paise kaa bhav he
 72 paise for 30 seats and one rupee for 36 seats is 15 paise, while BJP got 20 paise for 47 paise
 agar bijepi 25 siten jitati he, to bhav ek rupaya, 30 siton par do rupee 15 paise or 36 siton par chaar rupee 50 paise
 
 
 That is, BJP has three times more than Aam Aadmi Party, which is destroying its hopes of winning
 siton ke alaava satorion ne is baat par bhi satta lagaaya he ki dilli kaa mukhyamantri koun hoga
 In this too, Arvind Kejriwal is far ahead of Kiran Bedi of BJP
 kejariwal kaa bhav sirf 67 paise he, jabaki kiran bedi kaa bhav ek rupaya 40 paise he

 The pilot project of this project can be started this week, by digging a large pond in the floodplain of the Yamuna between Wazirabad to Palla, to store the flood water during the monsoon in the Yamuna
 jameen main lautega panibadh kaa sanchit pani baadh khatm hone ke baad waapas jameen main laut jayega, jisase aasapaas ke ilaakon main bhoojal kaa str na sirf richarge hoga balki behatar hokar pani kaa str or upar aa jayega

 Delhi will be able to use 66000 MGD of water
 Delhi government sources claim that after the completion of this project, Delhi alone will be able to use 66000 MGD of water daily from its groundwater sources
 philhal dilli ko pratidin 11000 mjidi pani kii jarurat he, jisamen se uske paas yamuna main haryana se chode gaye, ganga se aane vaale or bhoojal ke dohan se kul milakar lagbhag 950 mjidi pani hi vitaran ke liye maujuud he

 According to the Delhi government, Haryana releases about 11 lakh MGD of water during the monsoon, which is completely wasted
 sarkaar usee pani ko talabon main rokkar water harvesting takanic ke jariye baadh ke pani kaa istemaal karte hue rajya main bhoojal ko ek bada strot banane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Kejriwal government of Delhi is working with a full team of experts for this project
 is hafte ke aakhir main shuru hoga kamsarkaar ne aaj tak ko bataaya ki agle ek-do dinon main yamuna kinare rahane vaale kisaanon se unki jameen kiraye par liye jane kii prakriya shuru ho jaaegi or payalat project ke tahat pehle talab ke liye kaam isi saptaah ke ant tak shuru ho saktaa he
 The government will pay up to 5 xxrep 4 0 rupees per acre to the farmers
 monsoon ke uttar bharat pahunchane ke chalate sarkaar is pariyojna ko puri tarah is saal anjaam nahin de paaegi
 But after the pilot project is ready, the team of experts will take the data from it after the monsoon has passed and will also do a detailed study
 pani kii killat se jujh rahe bharat jaise desh jal sangrakshan jaisi takanic ko badhaava dene kii baat kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, this Delhi project can prove to be an example for the whole country
 chaahe bihar main kosi kii baadh kaa kahar ho yaa assam main brahmaputra nadi se aane vaala sailaab, baadh ke pani ko water harvesting takanic se agar phir se bhugarbha main bheja jaae to aane vaale samay main pani kii killat se nipta ja saktaa he

 In 1966, UNESCO (united Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization) decided to celebrate International / World Literacy Day on 8 September every year to increase public awareness of education and to attract the attention of people around the world

 We have to take a resolution on this day that every person should become literate, no one remains illiterate
 hamen apane yahaan se nirakshata ko bhagaanaa hoga
 What is the educational history of India, the educational history of India is very rich
 In ancient times, education was given in oral form by sages and sages
 jiske baad shiksha kaa prasar varnmaala ke vikaas ke baad bhoj patr or pedo kii chhaalon par likhit rup main hone laga
 Due to this, written literature began to develop and spread in India

 The establishment of world-renowned educational institutions such as Nalanda, Vikramashila and Taxila, played an important role in the promotion of education

 " "deepika padukon kitne baras kii hai? yah aaj kii taarikh main bollywood kaa sabase bada sawaal he
 The question raised about Deepika's age is so vexing that even Deepika herself is unable to answer it
 chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki 1995 se lekar 1998 ke bich deepika 8 main hi atak gai thim
 Shah Rukh Khan's film 'dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' was released in the year 1995, as if it had stopped
 tab deepika padukon kii umr thi mahaj 8 saal
 Then three years later, in 1998, Shah Rukh had another film 'kuch Kuch Hota Hai'
 tab deepika padukon kii umr kya hogi 11 saal
 But your calculation is wrong, because even then Deepika Padukone was only 8 years old
 umr ghatane ko lekar pareshaan3 saal guzar gayi
 Between 1995 and 1998, Deepika grew in stature, but Deepika did not grow old
 teen saal tak deepika sirf 8 saal par hi ataki raheen
 In this way we can say that people in Bollywood are worried about aging, but Deepika is upset with the decrease of her age
 shahrukh ne bhi lee chutkidarasal hua yun kii deepika farah khan ke saath salmaan ke sho das kaa dam main pahunchi thim
 Farah Khan then revealed the reality of Deepika's age
 us vakt shahrukh bhi us maukey par chutki lene se nahin chuke the
 He told Farah to care about the Child Labor Act
 sawaal yah he ki deepika ke do-do umr ke is rahasy par unke diwane kaise yakeen kar len, kyonki bollywood main deepika ek hi hai
 This world is also the same, the world's day is also one
 kahin aisa to nahin film 'om shanti om' or 'chandani chowk tu china' main apane role kii tarah deepika film duniya main dabl role kaa khel khel rahi hon
 Double so much that it has become double double
 pehle bhi umr ko lekar duvidhayah koi pehali baar nahin he, jo deepika ne apni umr ko jamaane se chupaaya ho
 There is something in the bag which Deepika eats in terms of her age
 lav aaj kal ke pramotion ke dauraan bhi deepika umr ke maamle main kanphyus thim

 'volga to Ganga' is a story collection written by Rahul Sankrityayan, whose stories have been written in the wake of events in the development of human civilization in history
 'volga se ganga' hamaare sabhy samaaj ke shuruaati yug ke matrusattatmak hone ko pratipaadit karti he
 This collection is a unique creation of female supremacy
 is rachana main striyon ke pradarshan or prakruti ke aise uddhran hai jo yah sthapit karte hai ki matrusattatmak samaaj main stri kitni unmukt, aatmanirbhar or svachhand thim
 The woman was nobody's property
 striyon ke swa-nirnay kaa us vakt bada praadhanya tha or ise ek swaabhaavik kriya ke rup main dekha jaataa tha
 From this point of view, 'nisha', the first story of 'volga to Ganga', is particularly notable
 kahanikar ke anusaar us vakt hind, iran or europe kii sari jatiyaan ek kabeeley ke form main thim
 There may be difficulty in believing but during that time women used to take initiative in every adventure and it was not a surprise but a natural occurrence
 is kahani ke anusaar matrusattatmak samaaj kii striyaan pashu-shikaar se lekar pashaan-parashu or baan chalaanaa, chaaku chalaanaa, pahaad chadhana, tairaaki, nrity aadi vibhinn kalaon main paarangat hoti thim
 Rather, she was faster and bolder than men
 'volga se ganga' pustak main kul bees kahaniyaan hai or unke bich main kuch sau varshon kaa antaraal diya gaya he
 The change between these stories remains credible
 8000 varshon ke samay main lekhak ne puure itihaas kaa ek nichod prastut kar diya he
 Regarding this story collection, Rahul Sankrityayan himself writes that "behind each author's story is the heavy material of the relation of that era, which is related to how many languages of the world, comparative linguistics, clay, stone, copper, brass, Indicative and written literature on iron or found in unwritten songs, stories, customs, totk-tones
 "shaayad yahi vajah he ki kahaniyon kii style main paryaapt vividhta dikhti he
 Through narration, conversation, autobiography, prapancha, etc
, the author has expressed the thinking of the people and shown the reactions of the people to the changes coming in the society
 pustak ke ant main bhadant anand kausalyayan ne kahaniyon ke sroton ke bare main likhaa
 In the book Ganga from Volga, the author has written stories around it, fully believing the Aryan invasion theory, at which time this theory may not have been so controversial, although at the end of the book Bhadant Anand Kausalayan criticized this book
 It is written in how the purpose of this book was questioned by calling Sankrityayan a nakedist, anti-brahmin
 kuch isi tarah kii bhaavana is pustak ke duusare sanskaran kii bhoomika main sankrutyaayan ne swayan vyakt kiye hai
 Anand Kausalayan did not write much in the cleaning of Rahul Sankrityayan, just wrote that if anyone were to criticize, he would have studied at least as much as Rahul Sankrityayan
 sankrutyaayan ko unke gyaan ke kaaran saahitiyik uddharanon main mahapandit ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Today, apart from language and other scientific methods, an attempt has been made to get to the root of Aryan invasion theory
 baharhaal is pustak kii pehali kahani volga tat kii he
 In which there is mention about the family structure, food, food and living of a tribe there 8000 years ago
 volga se ganga kii pehali chaar kahaniyaan 6000 i
 e se lekar 2500 i
 e tak ke samaaj kaa chithran karti hai
 Nisha, Diva, Amrutashv and Puruhut, these four stories belong to the period when man was in his Adam state, lived as tribes and filled his stomach by hunting
 us yug ke samaaj kaa or halaaton kaa chithran karne main rahul ji ne bhale hi kalpana kaa sahaara liya ho, kintu in kahaniyon main us samay ko dekha ja saktaa he
 The stories are full of imagination rather than the authentic, but the author cannot be blamed for that, in fact the authenticity of the history of India was greatly increased after the time of Buddha and Mahavira, for two reasons
 pehla, buddha or jain dharm ke granthon main devataaon kii atyadhik prashansa kii jagah us samay ke vaastavik saamaajik sthitiyon kaa chithran kiya gaya he
 Second, the truth of one scripture can be known by comparing it with any other book
 sikandar ke akraman ke baad bharat ke raajaaon or shaharon kaa zikr yavani sahitya main bhi miltaa he
 The next four stories in the collection are Purudhan, Angira, Sudas and Pravana
 in kahaniyon main 2000 i
 e se 700 i
 e tak ke saamaajik utaar-chadhaavon or maanav sabhyataa ke vikaas ko prakat karti hai
 In these stories, Vedas, Puranas, Mahabharata, Brahmin texts, Upanishads etc
 have been formed
 490 i
 e ko prakat karti kahani bandhul mall main baudhdhakalin jivan prakat hua he
 With the inspiration of this story, Rahul ji wrote the novel 'singh Senapati'
 335 i
 e ke kaal ko prakat karti kahani ‘nagadatt’ main acharya chanakya ke samay kii, yavan yatriyon ke bharat aagaman kii yaaden jhalak uthati hai
 Other stories include Vedic India, post-vedic India, stories from the time of the Buddha
 is pustak main jatvaad ke kaarnon main jane kii koshish kii gai he
 50 AD pus ke samay ko prakat karti kahani ‘prabhaa’ main ashwaghosh ke buddhacharit or saundaranand ko mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he
 Suparn Yudhyaya, Gupta period in India i
e
 420 AD
 pus
 Ko, to Raghuvansh, is a story revealing the time of Abhigyan Shakuntalam and Panini
 isi tarah durmukh kahani he, jisamen 630 i
 The time of appears, connects us with joyful, Kadambari, Hiuen Tsang and Etsing
 chaudaavin kahani, jiskaa sheershak chakrapani he, 1200 i
 Of the natural and the layout of that era pulls in front of us
 sankalan kii pandrahavin kahani baba nurdin se lekar antim kahani sumer tak ke bich main lagbhag 650 varshon kaa antaraal he
 These six stories expressing the political, social, economic and cultural trends from the Middle Ages to the present era - Baba Noordin, Suraiya, Rekha Bhagat, Mangal Singh, Safdar and Sumer bring us from the past to the present
 That we begin to feel the completion of a journey
 in kahaniyon main bhi katha-ras ke saath hi aitihaasik pramanikta is had tak shaamil he ki katha or itihaas main antar kar paanaa asambhav ho jaataa he
 According to Rahul Sankrityayan, there was no first division of work among the Aryan castes
 har ek manushya har ek kaary kar saktaa tha
 When the Aryan castes came into the Indian subcontinent, they saw business-oriented communities where a chief had a lot of power
 aaryon main satta lobhi logon ne is vyavastha ko apana liya tha
 Gradually this system strengthened its roots and it became almost impossible to change it
 aaryon or gaiyr-aaryon ke bich ke yudhon ko lekhak ne apane shabdon main vyakt kiya he, jiske kuch kuch ullekh mahagranthon main milte hai
 By the middle ages, the backward castes had become so angry towards the upper castes that they considered foreign rule too good
 pustak kii aakhri kahaniyon main lekhak ne samyawad ko bharat kii buraaiyon ke hal ke rup main prastut kiya he
 Hearing the stories of the Soviet Union at that time, it may seem that the feudal system had come to an end and the only objective of governance was the welfare of the people
 jatvaad or aay main ghor asamanta jaisi samasyaon kaa hal samyawad kaha gaya he
 Looking back after so many years, Soviet communism cannot be called completely successful
 nirankushta kisi bhi tarah kii ho use saraahneey nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 It may also be that communism is not well implemented in the Soviet Union
 lekin iske madhyam se sankrutyaayan ne dabe kuchle varg kii samasyaon ko ek aawaaj di he
 There is also a special thing about this book that Rahul Sankrityayan created 'volga Se Ganga' in the black cell of the jail
 jail tha hazaribagh kendriya karagaar
 According to jail records, he was imprisoned here for about 5 years at different times due to his participation in the freedom movement
 is avadhi ko unhone apane srijan ke madhyam se amit bana diya
 Apart from this, Singh Senapati and Darshan References were also composed here
 apane jivan main kul 155 kritiyon ke rachanaakaar rahul sankrutyaayan ek april 1923 ko pehali baar hazaribagh central jail ke bandi bane
 Since then, the continuation of their movement has continued
 27 march 1940 ko duusari baar tathaa 30 disambar 1941 ko teesri baar yahaan bandi rahe
 The silent witness to Rahul's creation is the Central Jail in Hazaribagh, in whose premises this high priest scripted his ideology
 ek ajeeb sanyog he ki unka janm or mahaprayan kaa maheenaa april hi rahaa he
 He had proved by embodying ideas that a man can live in the forest or on a mountain, in a river or in a valley, can use his every moment
 central jail ke rahul smriti kaksh main unki smritiyaan aaj bhi surakshit hai, shaayad isiilie bihar unhen bhuulaa nahin he

 bijedy ke varisht sadsy bhrituhari mehtab dwaara pesh kiye gaye‘kiraye kii kokh (viniman) vidheyak 2014’ke kaarnon or uddeshyon main kaha gaya he ki desh main kiraye par kokh dene vaali maataaon or kiraye par kokh ke madhyam se paidaa hue bacchon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye jaruri upbandh karnaa jaruri he
 The reasons and objectives of the Bill have stated that this process is becoming increasingly at the center of reimbursement services in India due to its low cost
 isse jahaan kiraye par kokh dene sambandhi takneekon se bahut se niraash danpatiyon ke jivan main khushi ai he, vahiin iske atyaadhik durupyog or isamen shaamil vibhinn naitik muddon ke kaaran isaki aalochana bhi ho rahi he
 It states that problems like important gender selection and its use in normal pregnancies are also encountered
 kiraaye par kokh dene kii pratha ko viniyamit karne ke liye kisi bhi vidhaayi dhaanche ke abhaav ne kiraaye kii kokh dene sambandhi chintaaon ko badha diya he
 The reasons and objectives further state that apart from this, there are many problems that need to be resolved
 jaise, kiraaye par kokh dene main videshi nagarikon ke shaamil hone kii surat main bacchon kii naagarikta, vivaah viched yaa kiraaye par kokh dene kaa kaary saunpane vaale mata pita kii mrityu kii sthiti main kiraaye kii kokh se paidaa hue bachche kaa bhavishya, kiraye par kokh dene vaali mata ke adhikaar or anya samasyaayein shaamil hai
 The Bill is to lay down the conditions under which rent can be taken up
 isamen kiraaye par kokh dene kaa anivaary panjikaran kaa upbandh bhi shaamil he
 Also, gender selection has to be made a crime in renting womb
 vidheyak main yah bhi praavdhaan kiya gaya he ki yadi kiraaye kii kokh dene kaa kaary saunpane vaale mata pita apane vivaah viched, mrityu yaa kisi bhi kaaran se bachche ko apni dekharekh main lene main asamarth yaa vifal rahete hai, to pehle se hi ek vaikalpik abhibhavak niyukt kiya jaae jo bachche kii dekharekh kii jimmedaari le
 It also states that a child born through levitation on rent in India will be allowed to enter the country as an organic baby
 isamen kaha gaya he ki yadi kiraaye par kokh dene kaa kaary saunpane vaale mata pita aise bachche main kisi bhi janmajaat vikruti yaa rog ke kaaran bachche ko lene se inkaar karte hai, to unhen saadhaaran karawas (jo do varsh se kam nahin hoga) yaa pachaas hajaar rupaye kaa jurmaana yaa donon se dandit kiya jayega

 grahon main mangal ko senapati kaa darja diya gaya he wo isliye kyonki mangal agar aap par meharbaan ho to jivan main har ore mangal hi mangal hota he lekin kamjor yaa ashubh mangal jindagi me amangal kaa vish ghol detaa he
 Problems are overcome by taking some measures to make Mars inauspicious and inauspicious
 aaie pehle jaanate hai mangal kii visheshtaayen-mangal kii visheshtaayen-- mangal grahon main senapati mana jaataa he- shakti,urja,aatmavishvaas or parakram kaa swami he- iskaa mukhya tatva agni tatv he or iskaa mukhya rang laal he
 - Tamba is its metal and barley is its grain- Aries and Scorpio are its zodiac signs
 - mangal makar raashi main sabase zyada majboot hota he- kark raashi main mangal sabase zyada kamjor hota haikaraab mangal ke parinaam-- insaan krur or hinsak swabhaav kaa hota he- aatmavishvaas or saahas kaa str kamjor hota he- sampatti or jameen ke maamle main mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 - Humans have blood related problems
 - aksar karj or mukademebaaji lagi rahati he- mangal ashubh ho to kabhi kabhi jail ke darshan bhi ho jate hai 
 - If it is related to the marriage sense, then the marital life is spoiled
 Mars of horoscope especially affects aspects of life such as happiness, property, disputes and litigation
 yani jivan ke har mode par kharaab yaa ashubh mangal kaa prabhaav rahata he or insaan kii jindagi ko prabhavit bhi karata he
 After all, how to make inauspicious Mars auspicious and what are the effective steps to make Mangal Mangal auspicious
 
 
 agar sampatti sambandhi samasya ho to
 
 
 - Take a triangular orange colored flag on any Tuesday - Write Rama with red color on it - Take it on Tuesday and offer it to Hanuman ji's temple - The problem of getting your property will go away if there is an obstacle in marriage due to Mangal Dosh
 - Stop fasting every Tuesday, do not eat salt on this day - Offer Hanuman ji's temple vermilion and red clothes in the evening - After this, recite "sundarkand" if litigation or dispute Yoga should be done - bathe in the morning every morning and offer water to the sun - after this, recite Hanuman Chalisa once in front of the sun - take satvik food and sleep on the land - do these experiments for twenty-seven days, you will benefit astrologers
 If we believe that Mars is inauspicious in your horoscope then it can create upheaval in your life
 
 
 isliye ye jananaa behad jaruri he ki mangal kab ashubh fal detaa he
 
 
 Inauspicious Yoga of Mars: Angarak Yoga - If Mars Rahu is in the horoscope together, it becomes Angarak Yoga - This yoga gives severe accident, surgery and serious blood related problems
 - is yoga ke hone par paariwarik sambandh bhi kaaphi karaab hote hai 
 - If this yoga is in the horoscope then keep fast on Tuesday- Worship Kartikeya ji every Tuesday
 According to astrologers, if Mars is on the 1st, 4th, 7th, 8th or 12th in the horoscope, then it is Mangal Dosh
 
 aise vyakti ko mangalik kaha jaataa he
 Mangal dosha cannot be ignored as it can cause problems in marital life, so it is very important to mix horoscope for Mangal dosh before marriage
 
 
 aaie ab aapako bataate hai kya he mangal doshamangal dosha- kundali main agar mangal lagn,chaturth,saptam ,ashtum yaa dwadash bhav main ho to kundali main mangal dosha hota he
 - When this happens, the relationship becomes very sensitive, hence horoscope matching is recommended
 - kundali main agar mangal dosha ho to vivaah or rishton main pareshaani aati he- mangal dosha agar samasya de rahaa ho to hanuman ji ko niyamit chola chadhayenjyotish ke kargar upaay aapaki jivan bagiya main khushhaali laa sakate hai
 
 
 By adopting these measures, you can make your life auspicious; Mangal has an impact on every important aspect of life
 
 
 
 But the position of Mars in every person's horoscope is not auspicious
 
 
 
 So today we are going to tell you that small solution
 
 
 
 Which will make your Mars very friendly and friendly to you very soon
 
 
 mangal kharaab ho to karen ye upyakraamak mangal kamjor ho to laal moonga dhaaran karenrakshatmak mangal kamjor ho to safed moonga pahanenrakshatmak,aakraamak donon mangal kii majbootee ke liye naarangi moonga pahanentambe ke gilaas se pani pienlal rang kaa kalava yaa rakshasutra dhaaran karembadon ke pair donon hatheliyon se chhuensurya ke saamne hanuman chalisa kaa paath karenhanuman ji kii upasna karen or unhen chola chadhayemgar aapako apane jivan ko mangalamay bananaa he to mangal kii kamazori ko dur karke use majboot bananaa hoga
 By taking these measures, you can strengthen your defensive or offensive or both types of Mars
