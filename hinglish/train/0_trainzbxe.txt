 dilli sarkaar main mantri satyendra jain kii mushkilen badhati najar aa rahi hai
 On Monday, CBI filed a charge sheet against Jain in Patiala House Court on charges of disproportionate assets
 grih mantralay ne satyendra jain ke khilaaf maamle main sibiai ko mukadmaa chalaane kii ijaajat de di he
 The CBI has found that Satyendra Jain's wealth is 217 percent more than his income
 vahiin, dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal ne apane mantri ke khilaaf karrwai ko sajeesh qaraar diya he
 Kejriwal said, Modi ji has done this case on Satyendra Jain in the crime of making a scheme to strengthen the raw colonies of Delhi
 in coloniyon main rahane vaali janata is baar modi ji ko jawaab degi
 Apart from AAP minister Satyendar Jain, his wife Poonam Jain and business associates have also been accused in the chargesheet filed by the CBI in court on Monday
 in kaarobaari sahyogiyon main ajit prasad jain, vaibhav jain, sunil jain, or aayush jain kaa naam he
 Health Minister Satyendar Jain and his wife Poonam Jain are architects in Delhi government
 satyendra jain ne apni patni ke saath milakar jeje idial state privet limited naam kii company kholi
 The cbi's investigations so far reveal that Sachin Jain and his family also have a stake in companies such as Inna Company Prayas Info Private Limited and Mangala Yatan Project, Akinchan Developers Private Limited
 satyendra jain in teenon companiyon ke diarector bhi rahe, lekin 2013 main chunaav ladane se pehle unhone diarector ke pad se istipha de diya, lekin satyendra jain kaa parivaar kaa in teenon companiyon main dakhal baraabar barkaraar rahaa
 The rest of the family remained share holders in these companies
 sibiaiki jaanch ke mutabik, prayaas mangalayatan or eke jaisi companiyon ne kolkata kii shell companiyon se kareeb ek karod 53 lakh rupye liye
 Satyendra Jain and Vaibhav Jain then sent the money to Kolkata hawala businessman Rajendra Bansal in 2016

 The CBI has tried to state in its charge sheet that even though Satyendra Jain resigned from these companies on paper, all these companies, through his wife, had complete control of Satyendra Jain
 sibiai ne aay se adhik sampatti kaa maamla satyendra jain par darj karne ke baad chaar alag-alag jagahon par chapa maaraa tha, jisamen satyendra jain kaa ghar company offis bhi shaamil the
 During the raid itself, it was learned that no staff worked at the company's office address
 parivartan sansar kaa niyam he
 
 
 Old leaves sprout from trees, new leaves come
 
 
 jo purana hua, nayaa uski jagah letaa he
 
 
 The new one is old and then someone new comes to replace it
 
 
 yahi sristi chakra he
 
 
 Is the principle of life
 
 
 lekin parivartan na aasaan hota he, na aasaani se hota he
 
 
 There is resistance in the process of change
 
 
 purana aasaani se apni jagah nahin chodta, nae ko aasaani se puraane kii jagah nahin mil paati
 
 
 This process can be called the transition period
 
 
 bhartiya janata party isi sankraman kaal se guzar rahi he
 
 
 The party which has been under atal-advani's shadow for years, is now ready for change
 
 
 party kii kaman duusari peedi ke haathon main dene kii rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) kii yojana sire chadhane lagi he
 
 
 Declaring Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate means his number one position in the party
 
 
 rajnath singh, arun jetali, sushamaa swaraj jaise netaa ab modi ke saath pehle paaydaan par pahunch gaye hai, lekin is parivartan kaa bhi virodh hua he, or ab bhi ho rahaa he
 
 
 The rss's attempt was that in the Lok Sabha elections 2014, the elderly leaders should vacate the field so that new people can get a chance to try their hand
 
 
 sangh chahta tha ki party ke varisht netaa netritv dene ke bajaae maardarshak kii bhoomika nibhaaen, isiilie prastaav diya gaya tha ki laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi loksabhaa ke bajaae rajyasabha main jaaen
 
 
 The proposal was given to all the leaders who had crossed the 75 mark in age, but the Sangh may not have imagined that this proposal would be strongly opposed
 
 
 86-varshiya laalkrishna adwani, 80-varshiya murali manohar joshi, 79-varshiya shantakumar, 79-varshiya bhuvanchandra khanduri, 78-varshiya lalji tandon
 
 
 All these leaders have remained in the field by pushing
 
 
 lekin bujurg netaaon ko loksabhaa chunaav ke maidan se hataane main party ko pehali kamyaabi madhya pradesh main mili
 
 
 There, 84-year-old Kailash Joshi has accepted this plea of the party after much persuasion and publicly announced that he will not contest the Lok Sabha elections
 
 
 bijepi ummidavaaron kii pehali suchi main shantakumar kaa naam himachal pradesh kii kangra seat se ghoshit bhi ho chukaa he, vahiin laalkrishna adwani is baat par niraashaa jataa chuke hai ki pehali suchi main unka naam nahin aayaa
 
 
 He has publicly stated that he wants to contest from Gandhinagar itself
 
 
 isi tarah murali manohar joshi pichley ek saal se media main chal rahi un khabaron se pareshaan hai, jinke mutabik narendra modi unki seat banaras se chunaav lard sakate hai
 
 
 On March 8, in a meeting of the Central Election Committee, he also asked party president Rajnath Singh to refute the news, but a day after the intervention of the RSS, his attitude cooled down and said he would accept the party's decision
 
 
 unhen bharosa diya gaya he ki agar narendra modi banaras se chunaav ladane kaa faisla karenge to unhen kanpur se tikat diya jayega
 
 
 On the other hand, Rajnath Singh also wants to leave Ghaziabad and go to Lucknow, and the current MP Lalji Tandon has been angered by this
 
 
 unhone kaha ki vah sirf narendra modi ke liye seat chhod sakate hai
 
 
 He dismissed the possibility of Rajnath Singh fighting Lucknow, saying that no one had talked to him about this
 
 
 haalanki vah yah bhi kehete hai ki party jo tay karegi, use maanenge
 
 
 However, despite all the opposition, BJP has decided to field BC Khanduri from Uttarakhand in the Lok Sabha elections
 
 
 jab party ne faisla kiya ki bujurg netaa loksabhaa chunaav na laden, tab unke prati anadar kii baat nahin rahi
 
 
 Rather, it was seen as a natural process of change in any political party
 
 
 bijepi is chunaav main baar-baar yuva matadaataaon par dhyaan kendrit karne kii baat kah rahi he, so, zaahir he, yuva matadaataaon kaa rujhaan kisi bujurg ummidavaar ke bajaae nae khun kii taraf zyaada hoga
 
 
 But ignoring the experience can also be dangerous for the internal health of a party
 
 
 bijepi main pichley ek hafte se chali aa rahi uthaa-patake ko dekhakar to yahi lagata he

 The threat of hot heat, lack of fodder and drought is now hurting many dairy farmers in Anantapur region of southern Kerala
 anantpur main pichley 30 saalon se rah rahe ananthakrishnan kannappan kii maane to is baar garmi kii maar se bachane ke liye deyari kisaan apane pashuon ko bech rahe hai
 This is the first time that due to lack of water and fodder farmers have to take such a step
 ve kam daamon main apane pashuon ko bechney par majaboor hai
 At the same time, a team of researchers from Kerala Veterinary, Veterinary Sciences University and Animal Husbandry Department of the state government are now promoting animals like Vecchur and Kasaragod
 team kii maane to is prakaar kii sthaneey kismon kii prajatiyon main garmi bardaast karne kii kshamta auron se adhik hoti he or ye jaldi biimaar bhi nahin padate
 Animal breeding and genetics expert EM Mohammed believes high-yielding cattle may faint or even die during humid summer days, but dwarf cows (dwarf cow) are animals of a breed in which heat wastes Ability to do more
 dworf kau ko jo kisaan paal rahe hai unka kahana he ki is bauni nasl vaali gaay kaa aahaar bahut hi kam he or kam pani main bhi ye apana guzaara aasaani se kar lete hai
 According to the expert, small-scale farmers need only one or two cows, which can easily meet the needs of their families
 tippaniyan According to agricultural experts, there are a total of 2
3 million cattle in Kerala, of which 6
 5 pratishat 'dworf' kism ke pashu shaamil hai
 But, one of the issues is over-spending
 matlab ek dworf nasl kii keemat ek bade nasl vaali gaay ke baraabar hoti he
 Which is about 20,000 rupees
 jab badi nasl vaali gaay swasth or tandoorust hoti he to ve zyada doodh detii he or yahi vajah he ki kisaanon ko badi nasl vaali gaay zyada pasand aati he
 Dwarf milk is very expensive
 isliye jin logon kii aarthik sthiti acchhee he, wo dworf milk kaa hi seven karte hai, kyonki ye kaaphi paushtik hota he
 Not only this, two such dwarfs have recently been brought from Kerala in Gujarat, while Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal has ordered 6 such dwarfs for a farm in Chandigarh
 vahiin, kerala pashu chikitsa, pashu vigyaan vishvavidhyalay or rajya sarkaar ke pashupaalan vibhaag ke shodhakartaaon kii ek team ab vechur or kasargod jaise pashuon ko badhaava de rahi he
 According to the team, species of this type of local varieties have more capacity to dissipate heat and do not get sick too quickly
 pashu prajnan or genetics ke visheshgy iem mohammad kii maane to adhik upaj vaale maveshi umas bhari garmi ke dinon main behosh ho sakate hai yaa phir mar bhi sakate hai, lekin bauni gaay (dworf kau) ek aisi nasl ke pashu hote hai, jinamein garmi bardaast karne kii kshamta adhik hoti he
 The farmers who are rearing Dwarf Cow say that this dwarf-bred cow has very little food and can easily survive even in low water
 visheshgy kii maane to chote paimaane vaale kisaanon ko aise mahaj ek yaa do gaayon kii jarurat he, jo unke pariwaron kii jaruraton ko aasaani se puraa kar saktaa he
 The comments krishi visheshgyon ke anusaar puure kerala main kul 23 lakh maveshi hai, jisamen se 6
 5 per cent 'dwarf' variety includes animals
 lekin, ek mudda zyada kharch kaa he
 Meaning a dwarf breed costs the same as a large breed cow
 jo lagbhag 20,000 rupye kii hoti he
 When large breed cows are healthy and healthy, they give more milk and this is the reason why farmers like big breed cows more
 dworf milk kaaphi mahange hote hai
 Therefore, people whose economic condition is good, they only consume dwarf milk, because it is very nutritious
 yahi nahin, haal hi main gujarat main aise do dworf kerala se laae gaye hai, jabaki punjab ke siem prakaash singh badal ne chandigarh sthit ek farm ke liye aise hi 6 dworf ko mangavaya he
 Animal breeding and genetics expert EM Mohammed believes high-yielding cattle may faint or even die during humid summer days, but dwarf cows (dwarf cow) are animals of a breed in which heat wastes Ability to do more
 dworf kau ko jo kisaan paal rahe hai unka kahana he ki is bauni nasl vaali gaay kaa aahaar bahut hi kam he or kam pani main bhi ye apana guzaara aasaani se kar lete hai
 According to the expert, small-scale farmers need only one or two cows, which can easily meet the needs of their families
 tippaniyan According to agricultural experts, there are a total of 2
3 million cattle in Kerala, of which 6
 5 pratishat 'dworf' kism ke pashu shaamil hai
 But, one of the issues is over-spending
 matlab ek dworf nasl kii keemat ek bade nasl vaali gaay ke baraabar hoti he
 Which is about 20,000 rupees
 jab badi nasl vaali gaay swasth or tandoorust hoti he to ve zyada doodh detii he or yahi vajah he ki kisaanon ko badi nasl vaali gaay zyada pasand aati he
 Dwarf milk is very expensive
 isliye jin logon kii aarthik sthiti acchhee he, wo dworf milk kaa hi seven karte hai, kyonki ye kaaphi paushtik hota he
 Not only this, two such dwarfs have recently been brought from Kerala in Gujarat, while Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal has ordered 6 such dwarfs for a farm in Chandigarh
 krishi visheshgyon ke anusaar puure kerala main kul 23 lakh maveshi hai, jisamen se 6
 5 per cent 'dwarf' variety includes animals
 lekin, ek mudda zyada kharch kaa he
 Meaning a dwarf breed costs the same as a large breed cow
 jo lagbhag 20,000 rupye kii hoti he
 When large breed cows are healthy and healthy, they give more milk and this is the reason why farmers like big breed cows more
 dworf milk kaaphi mahange hote hai
 Therefore, people whose economic condition is good, they only consume dwarf milk, because it is very nutritious
 yahi nahin, haal hi main gujarat main aise do dworf kerala se laae gaye hai, jabaki punjab ke siem prakaash singh badal ne chandigarh sthit ek farm ke liye aise hi 6 dworf ko mangavaya he

 isaki vajah se niveshak naakhush hue
 However, BSE has tried to provide immediate relief by abolishing transaction fees
 bachegaa itnaa paisabiesai ke mutabik len-dein shulk prati trade ke hisaab se lagata he

 "yoga does not cure every disease
 agar koi aisa kahata he to galat kahata he, kyonki yoga koi upachaaratmak vigyaan yaa vishay nahin he
 Our own experience has been that if the lifestyle is cured, diseases will disappear automatically
 lekin agar jeevanstyli thik nahin hogi, to tum kitne hi prayaas kyon na karo, thik hone ke baad dubaara giroge
 That is why we do not consider yoga as an alternative medicine, like today's society
 hamaare guruji hameshaa yah baat kehete the ki tum yoga dwaara apane aap ko thik bhale hi kar lo lekin tumhaari yoga yatra samaapt nahin honi chahie
 You have to keep going even before that
 vyakti apane swaarth ke liye yoga main aata he
 Performs yoga for one month, two months, six months, year-round and then off
 phir chaar-paanch saal baad jab dubaara girane lagata he, kamazor hone lagata he, tab sochataa he, jab main yogabhyas karata tha tab mujhe acha lag rahaa tha
 Now why don't i start again? It is not called yoga practice
 tum yoga ke uddeshy ko praapt karne ke liye nahin, balki apane hi prayojan ko siddh karne karne ke liye abhyaas kar rahe ho
 Today all the centers of yoga are centers of yoga, not yoga meditation centers
 yogic drushtikon se dainik abhyaas ke liye paanch asana hi paryaapt hai
 Tadasana, Tiriyak Tadasana, Katichkrasan, Surya Namaskar, Sarvangasana
 "yah sari jaankaree swami niranjananand saraswati kii kitaab 'yogic jivan' se lee gai he

 wo phir kabhi, varanaa aap ghabara jaaenge
 Change the lifestyle
 kya wo aapke bas main he? agar nahin to yoga aapke bas main nahin ho saktaa? phir bhi yoga karte rahiye
 Not for selfies, not for selfies

 Those who stand with lies are weak people

 Yoga takes you on the path of the truth of life, fills courage, develops the tendency to stay away from falsehood and illusion

 bemausam barish or olon se tabah fasalon ke muaavze ke naam par mili 75 or 100 rupee ke check waapas liye jaaenge
 After catching up with the matter in the media, the UP government has announced that no farmer will get less than one and a half thousand compensation
 prati vyakti kam se kam 750 rupee kaa muawza tay he, jise upi sarkaar ne doguna kar diya he
 a sample of how the farmers are having fun is seen in Faizabad district of Uttar Pradesh
 vahaan kai kisaanon ko 75 or 100 rupee ke check mili hai
 In this case, there is not even a single meal of a man in a dhaba
 yah maamla saamne aane par upi sarkaar ne elaan kiya he ki kisi bhi kisaan ko dedh hazaar se kam muawza nahin milegaa
 Compensation is Rs 4500 per hectare in irrigated area and Rs 9000 per hectare in irrigated area due to the old rule of the Center
 ek hectare main chaar bigha yani 80 katthe hota he
 Thus the compensation of one bigha in irrigated amounted to Rs
 1225
 agar revenue record main ek bighas main paanch maalik hai to har ek ko muaavje ke 225 rupee mili
 The UP government is paying double of this, but perhaps more than that would have been spent in distributing compensation
 faijabad ke wajidpur gaanv main kisaanon ke saath hue is khilwaad par adhikari bhi apni galati maan rahe hai
 Deputy District Magistrate Ashok Kumar Singh says that a team of accountants was deployed to survey the crop damage

 Vajpayee said, there was no Naib Tehsildar or Lekhpal in the village
 niyam ke anusaar, muaavje ke naam par kam se kam 750 rupee milane chahie
 The village has a pradhan's cemetery, which does not have farming
 is jameen par bhi aath logon kaa check bana diya gaya he
 Vajpayee told that checks were also issued in the name of the owners of the land which is not cultivated
 is khel main shaamil naayab tehseeldaar, patawaari tehseeldaar, kanoongo, up jiladhikari va jiladhikari ke khilaaf karrwai honi chahie

 After 9 years, 4 months and 28 days, again this question is being asked who killed Aarushi and Hemraj? You keep thinking and keep doubting
 par sachai yahi he ki aarushi cese ko kisi or nahin balki desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency sibiai ne maaraa he
 This is what happens when there is an attempt to force evidence on the tales of stories
 halaat ko kahani or kahani ko sach bataa kar jab koi cese khadaa kiya jaataa he, tab hashr yahi hota he
 Now find Aarushi and Hemraj's killer again after nine years
 elahabaad hoicourt ne guuruuvaar ko ek ahm faisla sunaaya
 The judge said in the filled court, 'this court, while giving the benefit of doubt, acquits doctors Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar from the charges of murdering Aarushi and Hemraj
 ' or iske saath hi nau saal chaar maheene or 28 din baad ye sawaal ek baar phir desh ke saamne aa khadaa hua he? ki aakhir aarushi or hemraj ko kisne maaraa? koun he in donon kaa kaatil?zaahir he is sawaal kaa jawaab hamaare paas bhi nahin he
 Anyway, when the country's largest investigating agency does not have the answer to this question, then where will we have it
 lekinarushi kaa kaatiljo bhi ho par itnaa daawey se kah sakate hai ki aarushi cese kaa kaatil koi or nahin balki desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency sibiai hi he
 The CBI has murdered this case
 sibiai ne hi gumraah kiya kanoon ko
 It is the CBI which has confused the story by wearing the mask of reality
 ab nau saal chaar maheene or 28 din baad phir se dhundho aarushi or hemraj ke kaatil ko
 Then create a new story
 phir lao koi nai theory
 For the last nine years, four months and 28 days, every parent was praying that what they are thinking may not be true
 nau saal paanch maheene das din se sibiai kii puri kahani jaanane ke baavjood har kisi ko yahi lag rahaa tha ki ye kahani adhuri he
 Is false
 chaar saal pehle 25 november 2013 ko sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ne jab talwaar dampatti ko kaatil qaraar dete hue umr kaid kii sajaa sunai thi tab bhi us faisle par bahes hui
 a finger was also raised on the verdict
 laga faisla adhuraa he
 The story is not complete
 kadiyaan aapas main jud nahin rahi hai
 The lawyers, arguments and stories are plentiful, but the evidence, eyewitness and theory were missing
 zaahir he adaalatein kahaniyon par faisle nahin sunaatin
 There should also be characters and evidence linking the stories to the stories
 or is maamle main vahi nahin tha
 Just because Allahabad High Court completely reversed the decision of the lower court, ignoring all the stories of CBI
 haalanki kehane vaale ab bhi kah sakate hai ki adaalat ne shaq kaa laabh dete hue talwaar danpati ko reeha kiya he
 Then this question will also arise and this will keep shaking every mind and whether a parent after killing his own daughter for the whole nine years, four months and 28 days will be punished for his bloody crime, his double feelings and hollow Why can we hide feelings? If doctors Rajesh Tavalar and Nupur Talwar are really murderers of their daughter, then of course both were also excellent actors
 elahabaad hai court kaa ye faisla chaunkaata nahin he
 Because the CBI did not find anything shocking in its investigation
 elahabad hai court netalwar dampatiko ab bari kiya he
 While the truth is that the CBI itself acquitted the Talwar couple before making the accused
 disambar 2010 main adaalat main cese band karne kii arji tak de chuki thi
 If the court rebuked, then the application to close the case had to be converted into a charge sheet
 ab aise cese kaa kya hashr hoga iskaa andaja kanoon kii jaraa si bhi samaj aakhane vaala aasaani se laga saktaa he
 So after nine years, four months and 28 days, now this question will be raised again as to who killed Aarushi and Hemraj? Would cbi's arrogant officer Arun Kumar and his team want to answer this question? Today the country wants to know this

 Explain that the resentment officers included Joint Labor Commissioner, Additional Labor Commissioner, Investigation Officer rank officer
 sabhi afasar lebar secretary sanjay kumaar saxena se mili or unhen construction welfare fund main ho rahi gadabadi kii jaankaree di
 At the same time, these officers have said that due to faults, they will no longer work for registration and renewal of new laborers

 In order to take these facilities, people with political patronage have registered their workers as laborers by creating fake union
 uske aadhaar par sarkari sahaayta galat tareeke se le rahe hai
 a Labor Department official, on the condition of anonymity, said that the department has also filed three firs in this matter and has given full information to the officers about the mess

 a sensational revelation has been revealed about the death of osama-bin-laden, the al-qaeda leader who has created terror all over the world
 laden ke ek purv bodyguard ne daawa kiya he ki osama america navy sil ke oparation main nahin maaraa gaya tha, balki usne suicide belt se khud ko uda liya tha
 Significantly, the US claimed that the Navy SEAL had killed osama-bin-laden's house in Abbottabad, Pakistan on 2 May 2011 under 'operation Jeronimo'
 america ke daavon kaa khandan karte hue laden ke purv bodyguard nabil nai abdul fateh ne khulaasa kiya he ki america navy sil jaise hi abtabad main osama ke ghar main daakhil hui vaise hi laden ne khud ko apni belt se uda liya tha
 Fateh said that at the time Osama died, he was not present there, but a close relative of Osama said this
 osama ke virodhiyon kaa manaanaa he ki uske samarthak jaanboojh kar aise propaganda failaate hai or purv bodyguard ke daawey main koi bhi sachai nahin he
 Abdul Fateh says that the American President's claim that Laden is buried in the depths of the sea is absolutely false
 usne kaha, 'bam dhamaake ke kaaran laden kaa sharir tukdon main cat gaya tha
 It was like a suicide attack in which it becomes very difficult to identify the person who died
 'fateh ne kaha ki laden ne khud ko isliye uda liya kyonki vah america sena ke shikanje main nahin aana chahta tha or vah marate dam tak apane raaj jagajaahir nahin karnaa chahta tha
 Abdul Fateh claimed that Laden used to wear belts equipped with bombs for the last 10 years
 abdul ke daavon par kitni sachai he, yah bhi andeh ke ghere main he
 Because there have been many types of reports about Laden's death

 "there is no short cut to maintain success", he said, "young bowlers have to be ready to work hard and then they will have to work harder to retain their place
" iske liye koi aasaan vikalp yaa short cat nahin he
 Many times i see that young cricketers reach a certain level, then suddenly they get good money and they stop working
 ’‘paise ko hameshaa sarvocch praathamikta nahin deni chahie’magra ne kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki paise ko hameshaa sarvocch praathamikta nahin deni chahie
 It is good that cricketers are earning well, but if you put money in the second category and always focus on doing well, working hard for it and putting yourself in the best condition, then money will always come
 meraa maananaa he ki kisi cricketer kaa aisa hi drushtikon hona chahie
 Your main goal should be to represent your country
 ’‘pink ball cricket se gendbaajon ko milegaa phayda’cricket board ab pink ball se de-nite cricket maichon ke aayojan par vichaar kar rahe hai or magra ne kaha ki isse khel main nae aayam judenge
 He said, 'I do not avoid it
 tii20 teji se aage bad rahaa he lekin mere liye test cricket vastav main mahatvapurn he
 'magra said that bowlers, especially fast bowlers, will be beneficial in such matches
 unhone kaha, ‘nishchit taur par pink ball se thodaa phayda milegaa
 There will be more grass on the wicket
 iskaa rang bahut teji se utrega or isaki pakad puraani gend jaisi nahin hogi visheshkar test gend ke maamle main
 This will give the bowlers little benefit
 isse unhen thodaa swing milegi
 i think bowlers will be tempted to bowl with pink ball but for that also they have to pitch the ball in right field
 ’ In England, Wales, a dangerous rapist has been exposed, whose actions will make any spirit tremble
 court ne repist ko 10 saal kii sajaa sunai he or sajaa puri karne ke baad kabhi bhi peedita se sampark na karne kii chetavanee di he
 According to the victim's statement, the rapist was so dangerous that during the rape, he wanted to cut the victim's throat and cut it out
 darasal yah khatarnaak repist pehle bhi aisi vaaradaaten kar chukaa he
 He has also been convicted in 2006 of the crime of beating an 18-year-old girl with a brick
 peedita chaar saal se is khatarnaak apradhi se peedit thi
 In 2013 also he has raped the victim
 lekin tab peedita ne chup rahanaa uchit samajha
 But this time when he raped the victim, he crossed all limits of barbarity
 rape ke dauraan usne peedita ke gale main pahani chen ke jariye galaa ghontkar hatya karne kii bhi koshish kii
 He even tried to stop his breath by putting a ring inside the victim's throat
 peedita ne haalanki uske chehre par waar kar kisi tarah khud ko chhudaaya or police main uske khilaaf shikaayat darj karai
 The fear of the rapist was so overwhelming inside the victim that she did not want to see him even during the hearing
 peedita ne bataaya ki pichhali vaardaat ke baad vah saat maheene tak ghar se baahar nahin nikal saki thi
 When the court offered compensation to the victim, she turned down and said that if i accept it, i will feel guilty
 peedita ne sunwaayee ke dauraan repist ko 'shaitan' tak kah daalaa or kaha ki vah chaahati he ki apradhi jail main hi mar jaae
 The victim said that i do not want to kill her nor do i want anyone else to kill her, but i do not want to see her alive outside the jail
 court ne apradhi ko 10 saal jail kii sajaa sunai he
 He is banned from contacting the victim after coming out of jail
 saath hi use jail se baahar aane ke baad bhi sex offender register main sin karne ke liye kaha gaya he
 The victim, however, expressed disappointment at being sentenced to 10 years
 peedita ne kaha ki use ummid thi ki apradhi ko kam se kam17 saal jelki sajaa sunai jaaegi, kyonki vah ek shaitan he or saarvajanik jivan ke liye khatra he
 Politics over Unnao rape case, SP and Congress demonstrated in Tejalkhanu After the death of the victim of Unnao rape case, the politics has increased

 isi bich congress kii mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra rape peedita ke parivaar se milane unnav pahunchi
 Priyanka said - After the convicts met the family belonging to the BJP, Priyanka Gandhi said, the family told them that the accused entered the house and also assaulted the father of the rape victim
 congress mahasachiv ne kaha, beete ek saal se peedita or uske parivaar ko pareshaan kiya ja rahaa tha
 i have also heard that the culprits are related to BJP
 rajya main aparaadhiyon main koi dar nahin he
 Targeting the BJP government of the state, the Congress general secretary said that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath says that there is no place for criminals in the state, but i think there is no place for women here
 prashasan ko bataanaa padegaa ki aisa kyon ho rahaa he

 akhilesh ne bolaa yogi sarkaar par hamalikhilesh yadav ne media se baat karte hue kaha ki desh hyderabad kii ghatana ko lekar gusse main tha
 The Unnao incident is not the first in the BJP government
 safadarajang ke doctoron kii koshishon ke baad bhi uski jaan nahin batch pai
 It is black day for us
 ek beti jo nyaay maang rahi thi ham use nyaay nahin de paae
 He further said that this is not the first incident under the rule of the current government of Uttar Pradesh
 unnav kii ek beti ne to puraa parivaar kho diya
 Who was to blame, the BJP government was guilty
 yah beti jisaki jaan gai he to uske bhi koi doshi he to vah sarkaar he
 Because the government was in the know

 The police evacuated the entire area around the court

 lekin suraksha agenciyon or police kii ye laaparvaahee kisi bade haadase kaa sabab ban bhi sakati he
