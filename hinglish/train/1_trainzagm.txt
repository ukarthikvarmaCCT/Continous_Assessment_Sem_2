 Their testimony can make it difficult for many of the accused in this case to escape
 idi ne guuruuvaar ko court main hui sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki rajeev saxena is maamle main hamaara mukhya gavaah hoga
 Rajiv Saxena said in the court hearing on Thursday that he wanted to help the investigating agency in this case and he would prove to be helpful as a government witness

 In 2009, when a well-wisher of the Congress gave a presentation about the modalities of New Age dialogue, no one took it seriously
 2013 ke aate-aate congress kaa soshal media par tabadatod hamalon kaa saamana shuru ho gaya
 The Congress got a heavy response to these attacks from the powerful political rival Bharatiya Janata Party
 aakhir upie virdohi abhiyaan ke rath par savaar hokar bijepi ne na sirf soshal media balki sansad main grand old party ko dhwast kar diya
 It is said that history repeats itself
 kya chaar saal ke bheetar hi dhara ulataa rukh lete dikhaai de rahi he? ‘media friendli’ or ‘soshal media kii betaj badshaah’ party bijepi ko ab usee ke tir se congress hairaan kar rahi he
 The leaves that Rahul Gandhi is throwing are seen falling straight
 beete kuch maheenon se rahul ke bayaan chutili hazirajvaabi ke saath raajnneetik paridrishy se taal bithaate bhi dikh rahe hai
 The depth of this new change can be understood from Korahul's recent tweet from Twitter handle @ officeofrg
 ye kisi se chupa nahin he ki narendra modi ne 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main apane prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan rahul ko shahjada kehete hue jamkar prahaar kiye the
 Now Rahul's tweet in the same 'as Ko Tit' style has come up- 'modi ji, Jai shah-jada Kha Gaya, were you a watchman or partner, say something
 ’ is twit ko paanch hajaar se zyada ritvit or 23000 se adhik like mili
 Not only Twitter, but also on Facebook and Instagram, Rahul has been showing a lot of activity for the past few months
 in acounts ko kuch hi maheene pehle bairiphai kiya gaya he
 Many people are giving credit to the changed social media team of the party for this change in the situation for Divya Spandana Congress
 is saal may main congress kii soshal media kii kaman actress se rajaneta baniin divya spandana ko saunpi gai
 Within five months, the presence of the Congress on social media made it strong
 karnataka ke mandya se divya 2013 main loksabhaa chunaav jiti thim lekin 2014 main hue aam chunaav me wo haar gayi
 Divya gave a lot of change to the entire social media team of the Congress and preferred new blood

 Divya has shifted from Bengaluru to Delhi under this responsibility
 divya kaa kahana he, ‘ye doynamik plateform he
 You have to respond immediately

 Vipin Yadav was working closely with Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan before assuming this responsibility in New Delhi
 haalanki divya soshal media plateform par haalia safalataa ke liye rahul gandhi kii salaah ko shrey detii hai
 Divya said, 'all the members of the team were mesmerized by what Rahul ji said in a meeting with the social media team on Friday
 unhone sirf ek sutri mantra diya- sach bolo
 Our consultation with him lasted for two hours and no one wanted this to end
 team ke sabhi sadsy utsahit or khud main nai urja kaa sanchaar mahasoos kar rahe the
 Rahul ji has a great sense of humor
 ham bhaagyashaalee hai ki hamaare paas aisa netaa ho jo hamen saare idia detaa he, hamen unhen bas amal main laana hota he
 In the last few months, the social media cell has teamed up with the Communications and Research Department for a new idea
 iske achche nattejey bhi dekhne ko mil rahe hai
 According to sources, the number of followers on the social media of Congress has increased by 10 lakhs in the last three months
 yahaan par rahul ne narendra modi ko peeche choda
 
 
 Twitter is a measure of Rahul Gandhi's growing popularity, as he is now getting a response
 tatasth trolls ab kam ho rahe hai
 New followers are increasing
 ek sutara kaa kahana he ki haal main @officeofrg ko @narendramodi twitor handle se zyada ritvit mil rahe hai
 According to the source, 'we are getting more than 5000 retweets which is quite a change
 adhiktar ye sidhe or first person main hote hai jisase hamen bade aadhaar se sampark karne main madad milti he
 'A big change in the strategy is that now tweets are being done in Hindi too
 china kii sena par kiya gaya twit surkhiyon main rahaa to use hindi main bhi twit kiya gaya, jisase dugana rispons mila, gujarat or himachal main vidhansabha chunaav sir par hone kii vajah se soshal media plateform par puri takat jhonki ja rahi he
 a good example of this is the tweet made by @officeofrg ahead of the Prime Minister's rally in Gujarat - 'the weather is going to be rain before the election'
 is twit ne hashtag # jumlokibaarish ke saath trand karnaa shuru kar diya
 In this way, the Congress has not only woken up to the challenge of social media but is also shaking the main opposition BJP to some extent
 iske liye kuch had tak logon ke kuch virgon main modi sarkaar kii nitiyon ko lekar asantosh or mohabhang se bhi madad mil rahi he
 The same Modi government that sent to power with a mountain of expectations, how important social media is going to be in the 2019 elections, this shows that by then Facebook will have 24 crore members
 twitor, instagram or anya portels ko bhi jod diya jaae to ye aankada kitna bada hoga, khud hi samajha ja saktaa he
 No political party can see this truth

 Mumbai Indians will clash with Rising Pune Supergiant in the final of IPL 2017, but despite this, Pune franchise owner Sanjeev Goenka has not shied away from comparing the two big players of his team
 hindustan times se ek intervyuu main sanjeev goyanka ne dhoni ko ek behtareen dimagdar khilaadi bataaya lekin kaha ki australian captain steven smith unase ek kadam aage hai
 Smith is one step ahead of Dhoni
 On Friday, Sanjeev Goenka told Hindustan Times, "MS Dhoni is the most intelligent person i have talked to so far and he is the best wicketkeeper in the world but Smith is one step ahead of him
" maine smith ko kaha tha ki is championships ko jito or nateeja saamne he
 "smith's strategy was unbelievable
 So far Sanjeev's brother Harsh had created a ruckus by posting an anti-dhoni post on Twitter, and now only the top boss of the franchise has taunted Dhoni
" sanjeev goyanka ne kaha, “jis tarah kuch ballebaajon ko out karne ke liye smith ne yojana banaai us par yakeen kar paanaa mushkil he
 Apart from this, the skill and perseverance with which he faced the difficult situation and only the winning attitude he filled in the players of the team, he put the whole team in one unit
 vah stritgic time out main batsmen se milane gaye or kaha ki yaa to 12 gendon main 30 ran thonko yaa out ho jaao
 We had a poor start because Smith stayed out due to a stomach upset
 ”goyanka ne aage kaha, “aapako plaof main jagah banane ke liye kareeb 8 se 9 match jeetne hote hai or smith ne mujhase kaha tha ki mere, taahir or stokes ke rahete hue ve saat match jeetenge or emes dhoni ke samarthy vaale khilaadi aapako hameshaa kuch na kuch dete hai
 We have more match winners this time, there are players who only take 5 to 6 balls in their eyes instead of 20 balls and we did not work too hard on Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar and Jaydev Unadkat
 sundar or treepathi bhavishya main team india ke liye khare khilaadi sabit honge
 Learned to deal with the arrogance of the star players, Goenka said, “the team gave young, fit and high-energy players a place in the team
 is baar jiske saath khilaadiyon kii zyada banati thi use tavajjo nahin di gai
 "not only this, Goenka also said that the team management has also learned to deal with the arrogance of the stars of the team
 unhone kaha, “ham un frenchygiyon kii tarah nahin hai jo apane kul 66 karod rupye nahin kharch nahin karnaa chaahate or paanchaven number par rahakar khush rahete hai lekin pichley saal mujhe iske bare main zyada pataa nahin tha

 Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray said that he thought his nephew Raj Thackeray would carry on his legacy as a cartoonist
 yah puche jane par ki kisi ne unki viraasat ko aage kyon nahin badhaayaa, bal thakare ne kaha, ‘ise koun aage badhayega? maine sochaa tha ki raja (raaj thakare kaa gharelu naam) ise aage badhayenge
 Thackeray expressed his views in an interview published in the party mouthpiece 'saamana'
 saamana main bal thakare ke saakshaatkaar kaa aakhri hissaa prakashit hua he
 He said that the favorite faces for a cartoonist are Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi, Prithviraj Chavan, Sharad Pawar and LK Advani
 86 varshiya thakare ke putr or party ke kaaryakari adhyaksh uddhav thakare photographer hai or vah bal thakare ke cartoonon par ek kitaab sankalit kar rahe hai
 Thackeray commented sharply on the media and said, "the editors have become salable
 ve raajnneetik partiyon ke chamachaa ban gaye hai
 This can be seen from his writings
 ’sarkaar main koi pad nahin lene ke bare main thakare ne kaha, ‘main satta se dur rahaa
 i could have held any position
 main maharashtra or dilli main mantralayon kaa hissaa ban saktaa tha
 i stayed away from the chair
 yah meri sampatti he
 Asked what message he would like to give to his followers, Thackeray said, "keep your loyalty

 ' nae saal main kadam rakhane kii taiyaari main jute hindustani rajaneta kaa cheharaa ek ajeebogareeb daanav-sa ho chalaa tha
 The confidence in him had taken shape, unmoved by the crop of aspirations and excitement that had been seated on the barren ground of the sensations of power, neutralized by the spreading cloak of grassroots dissatisfaction encompassed by his years of agitation
 galiyon-chauraahon par ubalte gusse kaa ek or din, buree khabaron se saje dastarkhwaan par media kii ek or daavat, khaane kii mej par naitikta khakhaarne waalon ke liye charchaa kaa ek or din
 
 
 All these were his well-known scenes, and he knew very well that all would be forgotten as soon as dawn
 use pataa tha ki is nirlypt bharat ke sanatani maahaul main uskaa raaj kaayam rahegaa
 But dawn happens, the first dawn of 2013, and its appearance has changed a bit
 uski ankhon main dar kii parchaai he, or siyaasi awaajon ke nakkaarkaane main uske gaddamdd alfaaz kaa betaratib shor use daraa rahaa he
 He is so deep in the dark tunnel of everyday politics that he does not see the light spreading on the streets outside the window
 shaayad aisi duniya kii use aadat nahin he
 Obviously, the reason for his fear is justified
 2013 main siyasat kaa akhaada ek aise bharat main banane ja rahaa he jahaan uske netaaon ke saare daanv puri tarah se bemaani hokar rah jaaenge
 Regional satraps and national giants are so deeply entrenched in the urgency of Khanty politics that they do not understand the generality of sentiment
 unke liye yah vakt 2014 ke aam chunaavon ke liye vahi ghise-pite naare gande kaa he, jisase ve apni chuki hui pratishtha par mulamme chadhaane kii khwaahish rakhte hai
 You see how the thick skinned leaders, including some big fishes, have all started showing themselves together and weighing their body with a snake named Prime Minister
 rajnatik chal ke behad jhine parade ke paar jaraa dhyaan se dekhie ki kaise takht par baitaane or takht palatney kii sajishein ek saath angadaeeyaan le rahi hai
 All these exercises are familiar to us, there should be no scope for doubt or confusion
 yah darasal badnaam or bhram main daalane waalon ke bich kii ladaai he; yah ladaai asli or nakli kii he, viraasat main milane vaali gaddi or uski chhina-jhapati karne waalon ke bich he
 These battles will in fact arise in the mirror of fragmented Indian politics with a desire to look better than ever before atonement
 in sab ke liye yah vakt saaj-shringaar kaa he, or aisa karne ko ve baadhya hai
 The ruling UPA, which is in its ninth year of rule, has only one face of the future battle - sometimes hidden in a light-colored beard, sometimes clean, but always less obvious
 vaise bhi, khandaani siyasat main rajeev gandhi ke daur ke baad siyaasi asar kabhi-bhi dikhne yaa sune-jane se nahin mapa gaya
 This year, however, Rahul Gandhi will have to look more and speak so that he can be heard
 bitate 2012 kii aakhri ghadi main noujvaan bharat kaa gussa saajha karne ke liye bharat kii sabase puraani mahaan party kaa yuva vaaris sadak par maujuud nahin tha; insaaf or jindagi ke sammaan kii ladaai kaa hissaa hone se usne inkaar kar diya
 Even if he connected, India could never know what was going on in his mind
 ab chunki maa se bete tak satta kaa hastantaran aupchaarikta maatr rah gaya he, lihaaja congress ke is chune hue bhavishya ko sabit karnaa hoga ki bharat kaa bhavishya hone ke laayak vah he bhi yaa nahin
 For this to happen, they must have a message that is in sync with the aspirations and expectations of their generation
 haalanki rahul ne ab tak aisa koi sanket nahin diya he
 Will the need for quick politics produce that message? Or, will they surprise us by breaking the wall of their ideological heritage in 2013? Gandhi has blood within him, he does not need any position to stay in power
 yah unhen ek vishesh kism kii aazaadee muhaiyaa karaata he
 So far he has rarely used this freedom electorally
 rahul chunki party ke agle sabase bade netaa banane kii raah par hai, lihaaja unka asar rashtriya str par mapa jayega
 Prior to the general elections, there are also some smaller battles in states where they can cash in on their surnames, for example, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Delhi
 unke saath tamaam swayambhu or sanakee kism ke logon kii baithak hoti ho to bhi kya
 Nobody is going to help them in this work
 sirf vichaar hi unki madad kar sakate hai

 Congrats @aaysharma Now is the time for a lot of mehnat aur lagan
 Wish you all success God Bless # aayushsharma Team India will now have to defeat arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday at any cost to keep alive their hopes of reaching the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup after a crushing defeat in the Super-8 against Australia
 bharat ke liye yah muqabla 'karo yaa maro' vaala hoga, vahiin pakistan super-8 main dakshin africa ko haraakar behatar sthiti main he
 Team India did not appear in any form against Australia and to return to the tournament it will be necessary that Mahendra Singh Dhoni's men learn from their mistakes and do not repeat them in this match
 bharat-paak match ke pehle khilaadiyon kii taiyaari kii tasveerengroup maichon main england ke khilaaf bharat kii paanch gendbaajon kii ranneeti hit rahi thi, lekin australia ke khilaaf beeti raat ke match main dhoni ke frontline spinneron ko shen watasan or david warner kii jodi ne dho diya
 Dhoni attributed the failure of his bowlers to the mild drizzle at the start of the Australian innings
 lekin sachaai yahi he ki puri gendbaaji ikai chunauti dene main asafal rahi thi
 Every bowler from r Ashwin to Piyush Chawla bowled full toss and bad balls which proved beneficial for this explosive pair of Australia
 dhoni haalanki apni paanch gendbaajon kii ranneeti ke saath adig rah sakate hai, lekin agar vah leg spinner chawla ko toornament ko ek or mauka dete hai to yah hairaani bharaa hoga
 Chawla became a 'worry' for Team India
 The Pakistani team has the best players in terms of spin bowling and there is no consistency in Chawla's bowling
 agar pakistani team ke khilaadi jaise imran nazeer, nasir jamshed or mohammad hafeez apni lay main aa jaaen to ve chawla kii gendbaaji kii dhajjiyaan uda denge
 Dhoni had suggested that slower balls would be effective on Premadasa's pitch, which meant that a bowler like Laxmipathy Balaji could be effective
 viru kii vaapasi par abhi bhi suspencebhartiya team main ballebaaji kii chintaaen bhi hai or yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki dhoni virendra sahvaag ko baahar rakhkar irfan pathan ko salaami ballebaaj ke rup main utaarna jari rakhte hai yaa viru kii team main vaapasi hoti he
 This can be gauged from the fact that Indian batsmen have so far managed to hit only seven sixes in three matches of the tournament, while Watson single-handedly hit India seven sixes
 haalanki yuvaraj singh ke team main shaamil karne ke sambandh main kuch gambhir sawaal puche ja sakate hai
 The selectors made an emotional decision after recovering from cancer and included him in the squad and it is proving in every match that this talented left-handed batsman should have seriously practiced some matches before his international return
 paak ke liye bhi ballebaaji chintaa kaa sababavahin pakistani team apni ballebaaji main sudhaar karnaa chaahegi kyonki umr gul or umr akmal kii shandaar ballebaaji se ve dakshin africa ko haraane main safal rahe the

 It will be interesting to see how Pant responds to the selectors

 ) dilli sarkaar ne afasaron ko apane paksh main rakhane ke liye buudhvaar ko ek saath kai tir chalaa die
 First of all, he appointed Principal Secretary Services in Delhi Government, Anindo Majumdar as CMD of Delhi Financial Corporation, finally giving a new department
 anindo majumdaar hi vah adhikari hai, jinhone shakuntla gammlin ko alji ke aadesh par kaaryvahak mukhya sachiv niyukt kar diya jabaki dilli sarkaar kaa kahana tha ki ye niyukti bina uski sahmati ke hui or niyukti ke liye anindo majumdaar ko pad se hataa diya gaya
 The LG then ordered the Delhi government to cancel the order and reinstate Majumdar, but the government refused to oblige and locked Mazumdar's office
 alji ne baad main phir aadesh diya, lekin sarkaar ne kah diya kii alji ko adhikaar hi nahin aise aadesh dene kaa or jab vivaad lanbaa chalaa to grih mantralay notification le aayaa
 a situation of resentment and dilemma had arisen among the officers, which the Delhi government could not deny and then started meeting with the officers to give the officers written orders as well as to build trust
 buudhvaar ko dilli ke up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya main dilli vidhansabha main bayaan dete hue kaha ki afasar ek tarah se chakki ke do paat ke bich pista hua sa mahasoos kar rahe hai or ham apni taraf se afasaron ke liye jo kar sakate hai kar rahe hai, lekin centre sarkaar pareshaan kar rahi he
 The comments yahi nahin dilli ke siem aravind kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli ke kisi afasar ko darane kii zarurat nahin he
 Kejriwal said that "these kinds of things are going on and confusion is being spread as if the officers do not listen to the Center, they will not get their salary, you should do your work honestly, is there any way to stop your salary? We will give you Salary: This assembly will give you salary
 " The Delhi government knows that whatever it does or says, but if the bureaucracy does not support it, then the government may continue to run, but it will not be able to fulfill the claim of making good governance and Delhi a model city
 or vaise bhi aam aadmi party ne apane dushman itane banaae hue hai ki agar afasaron se nahin pat pai to samajhiye ki baaki dushman se zyaada nuksaan kahin afasar hi na kar den
 Anindo Majumdar is the only officer who appointed Shakuntala Gamlin as acting chief secretary on the orders of LG, while the Delhi government said that the appointment was made without her consent and Anindo Majumdar was removed from the post for appointment
 iske baad alji ne dilli sarkaar kaa aadesh radd karne or majumdaar ko behaal karne kaa aadesh diya, lekin sarkaar ne maanane se manaa kar diya or majumdaar ke daftar par taala jad diya tha
 LG later gave the order again, but the government said that LG did not have the authority to give such orders and when the dispute went long, the Ministry of Home Affairs brought the notification
 afasaron main naaraazgi or duvidha kii sthiti utpann ho gai thi, jisase dilli sarkaar inkaar nahin kar pai or phir lagaataar afasaron likhit aadesh dene ke saath-saath bharosa banane ke liye afasaron ke saath meeting shuru ho gai
 On Wednesday, while giving a statement in the Delhi Legislative Assembly in Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that the officers are feeling like pistachio between two pots of mill and we are doing what we can for the officers on our behalf
 , But the central government is troubling
 tippaniyan Not only this, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said that no Delhi officer needs to be afraid
 kejariwal ne kaha ki "is tarah kii baaten chal rahi hai bhram failaayaa ja rahaa he jaise agar afasar centre kii baat nahin maanenge to unako tankhwaah nahin milegi, aap apana kaam eemaandaaree se karte jaaen, majaal he koi aapaki tankhwaah roak de? ham denge aapako tankhwaah ye vidhansabha degi aapako tankhwaah
 " dilli sarkaar jaanati he ki vah chaahe kuch bhi kare yaa kahe lekin agar afasarshahi uskaa saath nahin degi to sarkaar chalati bhale hi rahe, lekin sushasan or dilli ko model shahar banane kaa daawa vah puraa nahin kar paaegi
 And anyway, the Aam Aadmi Party has made its enemies so much that if it is not able to meet the officers, then understand that the officers should not do more damage than the other enemies
 iske baad alji ne dilli sarkaar kaa aadesh radd karne or majumdaar ko behaal karne kaa aadesh diya, lekin sarkaar ne maanane se manaa kar diya or majumdaar ke daftar par taala jad diya tha
 LG later gave the order again, but the government said that LG did not have the authority to give such orders and when the dispute went long, the Ministry of Home Affairs brought the notification
 afasaron main naaraazgi or duvidha kii sthiti utpann ho gai thi, jisase dilli sarkaar inkaar nahin kar pai or phir lagaataar afasaron likhit aadesh dene ke saath-saath bharosa banane ke liye afasaron ke saath meeting shuru ho gai

 Different claims are being made about Urmila on social media
 kuch kaa daawa he ki urmila rashtriya swayamsevak sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat kii bhatiji hai to vahiin kuch kaa daawa he ki urmila ne mohsin akhtar mir se shaadi karke apana dharm parivartan kar liya or unka ab asli naam "mariyam akhtar mir" yaa 'farzaana khan' he
 India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that all these claims are false
 soshal media par ispostco pratik shri anuraag naam ke shaks ne daalaa jisamen likhaa gaya he “aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat kii bhatiji urmila matondkar (kashmiri se shaadi ke baad farazaana khan) congress main shaamil hui”
 This post has been shared by 34 social media users so far
 vahiin kanak mishra naam ke ek soshal media yuzar ke ispostmen daawa kiya gaya he, “urmila matondkar congress se chunaav ladegi! urmila ne islam kabool kar apane se 9 saal chote kashmiri bijness main mohsin akhtar mir se nikaah kiya tathaa apana naam mariyam akhtar mir rakh liya! lekin chunaav parche par hinduon ko $ # @ banane ke liye urmila matondkar likhaa jaayegaa!”india today anti phek news war room ne apni jaanch urmila matondkar ke soshal media profile ko khangaal kar kii
 Urmila has an account on both Instagram and Facebook, in which her name is the one by which she is known
 fasebukaurainstagramdonon par kahin bhi urmila or mohan bhagwat ke ek saath hone ke photo nahin he
 When India Today anti-fake News War Room asked Urmila directly on Mohan Bhagwat's relationship, she was shocked and denied it
 urmila ne kaha, 'ye baat to ek film script se bhi aage chali gai, isamen koi sachai nahin he
 'the other matter of the claim that Urmila has converted to religion and changed her name after that
 hamane isaki bhi padtaal kii, ye baat sahi he ki urmila ne ek kashmiri bijnesaman mohsin akhtar mir se 2016 main shaadi kii thi
 Mohsin has also done a small fat role in Bollywood
 urmila ne apane pati mohsin ke saath kai saare photo apane soshal media acount main aplod kiye hai
 When we asked Mohsin directly on this issue, he said, 'such claims are made before the election, but it does not matter to us
 meri patni ne dharm parivartan nahin kiya tha
 You can see on his Instagram account that like other stars, he has neither changed his name nor put my surname in front of his name
 agar aap hamaare ghar aae to aap dekhenge ki hamaare ghar main mandir bhi he
 People working in our house will also tell you that Urmila has not changed her religion
 'chuki dharm parivartan ko lekar koi kanoonee baadhyataa nahin he or khud unke pati mohsin ye baat kah rahe hai to ye mana ja saktaa he ki urmila ne dharm parivartan nahin kiya

 In Jammu and Kashmir, separatist leader Mohammad Qasim asked the Muslim community of the state to produce more than one marriage and more children, so that the population of Muslims in the state would remain
 kasim ne apni party 'muslim dinimahaj' kii ore se ek bayaan main kaha ki rajya ke musalmaan ek se zyada shaadi karen or zyada se zyada bachche paidaa karte rahen
 Qasim said that there was a conspiracy to reduce the Muslim population behind the establishment of refuges in Jammu and Kashmir

 He himself is responsible for the declining Muslim population in the state
 ladakiyon kii der se shaadi karwaane se unamem bachche paidaa karne kii kshamta kam hoti ja rahi he
 Qasim said that after marriage, the people of our community are not producing children by getting caught in the slogan of 'hum Do Hamare Do' and 'first, Not Now, Second Never', with population control slog, which reduces the Muslim population in the state

 *** kulbhushan jadhav parabharangle saal 18 farvari kopakistanke jhooth se pardaa uthayega
 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) will hear Kulbhushan Jadhav from February 18 to 21 next year
 yah sunwaayee do round main hogi
 First India will be given a chance to put its side in it, after that Pakistan will speak
 18 farvari 2019 ko pehle round main subah 10 baje se ek baje tak bharat ko apni baat rakhane kaa mauka milegaa
 The next day ie 19 will be Pakistan's number
 use bhi subah 10 se dopaher ek baje tak kaa samay diya jayega
 In the second round, the time has been fixed for India from 3 to 4:30 pm on February 20, while Pakistan has to put their side on February 21 from 4:30 to 6 pm
 pakistan main imran khan kii sarkaar banane ke baad bhi uske rukh main koi bartaav nahin aayaa he
 Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi claimed in August that Pakistan had 'concrete evidence' against Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav and was expected to win the case against him in an international court
 gauratlab he ki 47 varshiya jadhav ko pakistan kii ek sainya adaalat ne jasusi ke aarope main april 2017 main maut kii sajaa sunaayi thi
 India had approached the international court against that decision in May of the same year
 antarrashtriya adaalat ne bharat kii apil par jadhav kii faansee par roak laga di
 Pakistan says its security forces arrested Jadhav from Balochistan province in March 2016 after he allegedly entered the country from Iran
 pakistan ne antarrashtriya adaalat main kaha he ki jadhav koi saamaanya vyakti nahin he, balki usne jasusi or todphod ke iraade se desh main pravesh kiya tha
 At the same time, India has denied these allegations since the beginning and said that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran where he was living in connection with his business after retiring from the Navy, but he had no contact with the government
 madhya pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal main 18 sitambar ko sadak ke kinare bade-bade postaron main rahul gandhi shivlinga par jal chadhaate najar aa rahe the
 The Congress President, who returned after a 12-day visit to Kailash Mansarovar, held a big rally in this state with assembly elections that day
 haalanki unhone kisi dharmik bhaavana kaa aahvaan nahin kiya lekin postaron ne is nae "shivbhakt'' ke jariye jaahir kar diya ki congress "soft hindutv'' kii dahalij par khadi he
 Not only Congress but Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP) and even the Left parties are seen walking the same path of religion to woo the majority voters, for which they have been cursing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 
 darasal, bhaajapa kii kamyaabi ne in partiyon ko bahusankhyak matadaataaon ko dharm ke naam par rijhaane kaa sabak sikhaaya he
 And this is not unreasonable
 jaraa gaur kareh hindutvvaadi kahi jane vaali bhaajapa ne kareeb 17 karod vot hasil kar loksabhaa kii 282 siton ke saath joardaar jeet darj kii
 Then three years later in March 2017 it also won the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections with an overwhelming majority
 desh ke is sabase bade soobe main loksabhaa kii 80 main 71 siten or vidhansabha kii 403 main se 312 siten bhaajapa apane khate main karne main safal rahi
 The issue of construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya in the state was in the manifesto and agenda of the party's 2014 Lok Sabha elections and 2017 assembly elections
 is dauraan party ne jamkar hindutv kaa card khelaa or dharmik dhruvikaran main kaamyaab rahi
 For example, the BJP campaigned everywhere that political parties were busy trying to hold on to the minority (mainly Muslim) vote bank instead of wooing Hindu voters
 vipakshi dal ke netaaon ne bhi is dharna main madad kii
 For instance, during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Mulayam Singh Yadav said at a rally in Benaras that those who are questioning the Muzaffarnagar riots can tell who has helped Muslims more than the SP
 is tarah ke bayanon se dhruvikaran ko or badhaava mila
 In such a situation, the results of the last Lok Sabha and Uttar Pradesh assembly elections made it clear that the BJP did not allow the Muslim vote bank of its opposition parties to take effect (muslim votes were divided among the anti-bjp parties) with Hindutva at its center
 lihaaja, bhaajapa virdohi partiyon ne hindu voter naaraaz na ho, isko lekar hindu devi-devataaon kii pairokari tej kar di he
 The main opposition party, Congress President Rahul's own faith in Hinduism and traveling from Kailash Mansarovar to various temples is seen as the same, although Rahul has made it clear in Parliament that he is not Hinduism but Hinduism i believe bhaajapa ke rashtriya pravaktaa or rajyasabha sadsy jiviel narsingh raav kehete hai, "muslim tushtikaran kii paraakaashtha karne vaale dalon ke netaa achaanak se mandir jane lage hai to sirf isliye ki ve dharm kii raajnneeti karne lage hai
 From the Left to Mamta Banerjee have started going to the temple
 yah acchhee baat he, lekin dharm ke naam par siyasat karnaa thik nahin he
 "it is a matter of fact that the BJP itself puts Hindutva on its agenda
" yahaan tak ki vaicharik antarvirodh ke baavjood wapamanthi dalon ne bhi mandir or hindu dharm ko lekar apana rukh lacheela kar liya he
 Devaswom Minister K
 K
 of LDF Government in September 2017 in Kerala called Gods on Country
 surendran trishur sthit guuruvayur mandir pahunche the
 This was perhaps the first time in Kerala's leftist government when a minister of the government not only reached the temple but also offered prayers there
 bhaajapa netaaon ne ise acha kadam bataaya, lekin ise hindu votaron ko rijhaane kii koshish bhi qaraar diya
 On the dispute, the Left government came to some extent on the backfoot and the CPI (M) formed a committee on the matter
 sutron kaa kahana he, "party kii vichaardhaara ke mutabik aisa karne vaale mantri ko na sirf sarkaar se hataaya jaataa he balki party se bhi baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya jaataa
 "but the committee neither recommended the removal of the minister, nor condemned the minister's visit to the temple
" unhen sirf chetavanee dete hue cameti ne apni report main kaha, "surendran kaa bataur mantri, mandir janaa galat nahin he lekin vahaan jaakar puja-archana karnaa party ke siddhanton ke anukool nahin he
 "obviously, in a way, the party allowed the Left leaders or ministers to go to the temple silently
" vahiin kerala bhaajapa ke adhyaksh pies shridharan pillai kehete hai, "darasal vampanthi partiyon ko pataa chal gaya he ki hindu vot ke bina unka kaam nahin chalegaa
 The Kerala government knows that taking action on Surendran would offend Hindu voters
 yah rajya main bhaajapa kii badhati takat kaa parichaayak he ki khud ko naastik bataane vaale vampanthi bhi bhagwaan kii sharan main aa rahe hai
 "this temple policy of the LDF government seems to be an attempt to woo Hindu voters directly, but to prevent Hindu voters from getting angry
" isi tarah pashchim bengal main vampanthi dalon ke saath-saath bhaajapa kii bhi dhur virdohi tiemasi pramukh or mukhyamantri mamata banerjee bhi "hijaab pahanane'' or "kalma padhgaye'' kii siyasat se nikal kar ramanavami manaane kaa elaan karne se khud ko nahin roak saki
 BJP spokesperson Rao says that Mamata Banerjee had issued a decree in 2017 not to allow Ram Navami procession but suddenly realized that Hindu voters were moving away from her, she ordered her workers to take out the procession this time
 2014 main mamata banerjee pashchim bengal main modi lahar ko rokane main kaamyaab rahi thim
 When Mamata became the Chief Minister again in 2016, openly advocating Muslim voters, she set the venue for Saraswati Puja and idol immersion, which the BJP said was a conspiracy to curb the worship
 maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue agle saal mamata ne moorati visarjan ke liye raste tay karne kii kavayad chhod di
 Given the bjp's impressive performance in the state's panchayat elections (gaining 20 per cent seats and becoming the number two position after TMC) and her growing cadre, Mamata has flexed her stance
 isi saal march main unhone ramanavami manaane kaa elaan kiya
 He asked his workers and leaders to take out Ram Navami's visit and participate in it
 vahiin iske thik ek saal pehle unhone ramanavami juluus nikaalane kii bhaajapa kii ghoshnaa kaa virodh kiya tha
 West Bengal BJP President Dilip Ghosh says, "it is the moral victory of the BJP that the Chief Minister had to decide to celebrate Ram Navami
 pichley saal unhone iskaa virodh kiya tha
 Those at the TMC were arguing that there was no tradition of worshiping Lord Rama in Bengal, that they really wanted to divide the Bengali and non-bengali Hindus
 jis dhoomdhaam se ramanavami manaai gai usne tiemasi ke jhooth ko tikne nahin diya
 Apparently, Mamata is now strategically asking TMC workers to join festivals like Durga Puja, Saraswatipuja, Ram Navami in view of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 tiemasi ke ek netaa maanate hai ki ramanavami jaise juluus ke virodh se hinduon main galat dharna ban rahi thi
 Especially the way BJP was trying to declare TMC as anti-hindu party would have hurt TMC
 aagaamee aam chunaav ke siyaasi daanv-pech main 80 loksabhaa seat vaala uttar pradesh behad ahm he
 The SP, which describes itself as the biggest benefactor of Muslim voters, has also started talking about Hindu deities prominently
 sapa adhyaksh or purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne isi saal agast main ghoshnaa kii ki agar agali baar rajya main sapa sarkaar banegi to ve cambodia ke ankorwat mandir kii tarj par bhavy vishnu mandir banavaayenge
 He said, "on coming to the SP government, a grand temple of Vishnu will be built on 2,000 acres of land in Etawah
 bhagwaan vishnu ke naam par mandir ke paas ek shahar bhi viksit kiya jayega
 "this SP temple has left behind the past of the Raga Party when SP leader and former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav ordered firing on kar sevaks for allegedly saving Babri Masjid and Hindutva leaders have surrounded him
" 
 ab tak khule taur par isse bachane vaale dalon ke hindutv kaa chola pahane kii kavayad sirf in chhit-put rajyon or sthaneey dalon tak simit nahin he
 The main opposition party, Congress, in order to cut off the bjp's allegations of being a Muslim prodigy in the Gujarat elections last year, visited every temple, declared himself a devotee, and his lieutenants promoted him as a Janudehari Brahmin
 ab phir madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh main rahul ne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan mandir dar mandir janaa shuru kar diya he
 When Rahul Gandhi is reaching among the Congress workers, "every har bhol and bomb bhol bhol" are shouting slogans
 gujarat ke baad karnataka chunaav ke dauraan bhi rahul kaa mandir janaa surkhiyon main tha
 At the same time, from the monsoon session of Parliament, Rahul has openly expressed his faith in Hinduism
 congress ke media vibhaag ke pramukh randeep singh surajevaala kehete hai, "bhaajapa khud ko hindutvvaadi party bataa kar mob linching or anya aniatik kaaryon ko jaij tehraane kii koshish karti he
 Whereas Hinduism is not like this
 hindu dharm main hinsa ke liye koi jagah nahin or rahul gandhi usee kii baat karte hai
 According to Surjewala, "those who criticize Rahul Gandhi for being a devotee or visiting his temple have actually lost ground from under his feet
" agar aisa nahin hota to rahul gandhi ke mandir jane se bhaajapa ko kyon aapatti hoti? darasal, bhaajapa or aresas lambey samay se yah bhram failaa rahi he ki congress hindu virdohi party he
 Now their conspiracy has been exposed so bjp's people are scared due to Rahul's going to the temple
 ''darasal, vipakshi dal bhaajapa kii us ranneeti ko kund karnaa chaahate jiske tahat dhruvikaran kaa maahaul banataa he
 anti-bjp parties understand this very well that it is difficult to compete with BJP in the state of polarization, especially in the Hindi belt
 bihar, jharkhand, uttar pradesh, dilli, himachal pradesh, uttarakhand, rajasthan, haryana, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main kul milakar loksabhaa kii 225 site hai, jahaan vipaksh bhaajapa ke kor vot bank main send lagaana chaahati he
 Therefore, the opposition parties do not want to give the BJP any chance to declare the opposition parties in these states as Muslim
 bhaajapa par aakraamak hone ke liye vipakshi dalon, khaskar congress ne naram hindutv kaa raag chhedaa he
 She is raising issues like mob lynching against the BJP, but is also taking care that she does not appear to appease the Muslim in this affair
 rahul gandhi yaa surajevaala jab kehete hai ki "hamaara (congress kaa) hindutv vah nahin he jo bhaajapa yaa aresas kaa he'' to ve yah jataana chaahate hai ki congress us hindutv ko maanati he jise bahusankhya hindu maanate hai yani jisamen hinsa kaa nishedh ho
 Through this, the Congress also wants to build the trust of the Muslims and at the same time, the Hindus also do not want to give an opportunity to be angry
 congress ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, "dhruvikaran kaa maahaul banaakar aresas ke log bahusankhyak voton (hindu vot) ko ekajute rakhane kii chaal chalate the, vahiin bhaajapa virdohi dal muslim pairokari kii baat karte the or unamem musalmaan vot bant jaataa tha, lekin vah mauka ab bhaajapa ko nahin milegaa
 In the last two years, opposition parties have created such an atmosphere that the BJP is now finding it difficult to keep its core vote bank (hindu) united
 mahangaai, kisaanon kii samasya, dalit masalaa, berogari se lekar bhrashtachari ke aarope kaarobaariyon ke bhaag jane or rafel jaise muddon ko lekar bhi logon main naaraazgi he
 Due to these anti-incumbency trends, this time the bjp's biggest challenge is to stop the split in the Hindu vote bank
 lekin bhaajapa ke media vibhaag ke pramukh tathaa rajyasabha saansad anil baluni kehete hai, "congress is mugalate main he ki rahul gandhi khud ko shivbhakt bataakar vot hasil kar legi
 BJP will get votes not only of Hindus but also of Muslims
 bhaajapa vikaas ke mudde par chunaav lard rahi he
 After defeating the Congress in Karnataka and Gujarat, people told that the people are with Modi and not with Rahul Gandhi
 ''siyaasi dalon main khud ko hindu hitaishi banane kii hode se aresas bhi gadgad he
 Sangh leaders believe that "this is a better chance for the central government to start talks with other parties for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya
" '' sangh ko ummid he ki aise main ram mandir ko lekar amrai banaai ja sakati he
 The BJP may not be challenged by various parties adopting the path of soft Hindutva, but the basis of majority vote sharing has been laid

 On Friday evening, BJP president Amit Shah arrived in West Delhi's Uttam Nagar area for an election rally
 manch ke aasapaas bheed or bijepi kaaryakarta jute hi rahe hai ki netanuma kurta pahane ek shaks vahaan se chal padate hai, baahar nikalakar ve apane vaahan ke liye yahaan-vahaan nazren daudaate hai
 When asked for an introduction, a colleague of his tells that he is RSS pracharak Vishnu Sharma, who has come to see the arrangements for Amit Shah's next election rally in Janakpuri, near Uttam Nagar
 baad main vishnu sharma ko do baithkon main hissaa lenaa he—baithak sangam vihaar or dakshin dilli ke badarpur main booth cluster cameti ke prabharee kendriya mantri or bijepi sansadeey board ke sadsy anant kumaar ke saath honi thi, jo sharma ke saath hi dilli ke chunaav prabharee hai
 Although Sharma and Anant Kumar are not residents of Delhi, but have been engaged for management along with BJP central leaders and workers in Delhi's election war
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah khud is chunaav abhiyaan main urja bhar rahe hai
 And his motto is, micromanagement — it rarely happens that the president of the ruling party plays such a big role in the election of the Adna-si assembly in Delhi, and keeps a close watch on all publicity management
 is behad rajnatik sargharmiyon vaale daur main dilli jaise chote-se shahar-rajya kii khaas ahmiyat na rakhane vaali vidhansabha kaa chunaav sahasaa pichley saal ke loksabhaa chunaav se bhi adhik mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 Therefore, the Union Minister may have twisted his eyes on the idea that the Delhi Assembly elections are opinion on the popularity of the Modi government, but after pre-poll surveys predicted a heavy tilt in favor of Arvind Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Shah For these 70 seats, the entire army of leaders of BJP and Sangh Parivar has been thrown
 chunaav prabandhan ke in tareekon main shah ne pehali baar panna prahari vyavastha kaa bhi aagaaj kiya he, jis par jor-shor se amal ho rahaa he
 The idea is to try this scheme in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh as well
 anant kumaar bataate hai ki iske tahat 1,24,000 panna prabharee shahar main sakriy hai
 These incharge requests every voter to stamp a lotus on a page of the voter register
 pichley saal disambar main shuru hui yah vyavastha pichley kai saal se gujarat, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main safal rahi he
 About 120 mps from different states have been called to work as planned
 ye sabhi prabhariyon kii nigaraanee rakhe hue hai
 Above all, Shah himself is associated with it
 dilli bijepi prabharee prabhaat jha kehete hai, ''amit shah kaa tarika yahi he ki ve party sanghathan kii takat par chunaav ladate hai
 They consider everyone as a party worker, whether it is a senior leader or a union minister and they use them for campaigning
 '' jha yah bhi bataate hai ki shah khud din ke 18 ghante kaam kar rahe hai
 However, Shah denies that he is playing more roles than is necessary
 ve kehete hai, ''main lagaataar 14 dinon tak maharashtra main tha
 i would campaign in Haryana and catch a flight to Maharashtra
 agali subah phir haryana laut aata
 "but India Today has a blueprint for the five-tier system that Shah has laid out for election management (see graphic)
 is vyavastha main kendriya mantri, bijepi shasit rajyon ke mantri or duusare rajyon ke saansad or vidhayak, purnakalik kaaryakarta sabhi kii bhoomika vistaar se tay kii gai he
 In addition, the leaders of the state unit, Delhi president, district president, in-charge of assembly constituencies, divisional president, booth committee and Panna Prahari are included
 uttam nagar main kaaphi jaldbaaji main najar aane vaale sharma aresas prachaarak hai or do loksabhaa kshetron (jiske tahat 20 vidhansabha kshetra aate hai) ke prabharee hai
 They are extensively managing elections under a five-tier system
 baaki paanch sansadeey kshetron (harek ke tahat 10 vidhansabha siten) kaa prabhaar sambhaal rahe aresas prachaarak hai—mahendra pandey, rakesh jain, raghunatha kulkarni, raghavendraji or sher singh
 Below this, two management units are functioning at the district and assembly levels; Among them are Union ministers and full time BJP workers
 vibhinn rajyon se aae in purnakalik kaaryakartaaon ko jharkhand or jammu-kashmir main chunaav prachaar puraa hote hi bula liya gaya tha
 In late January, Shah created a two-tier system of party leaders at the district and assembly constituency levels
 yahi nahin, shah ne janvari ke pehle hafte main purnakalik kaaryakartaaon kii baithak bulaai or unase jamini str par prachaar kii pragati kii jaankaree lee
 The picture that came out of these ground assessments was not going to please Shah
 yahi nahin, walantiaron kii madad se dhuandhar chunaav prachaar karti aap or 10 janvari ko ramlila maidan main pradhanmantri modi kii jansabha main logon kii thandi pratikriya ne kendriya netaaon ko satark kar diya
 After this, it is said that unlike the assembly elections in other states, it was decided to announce the Chief Ministerial candidate here
 usee feedback ke aadhaar par yah bhi tay kiya gaya ki shah chunaav prachaar kii kaman khud sanbhaalein
 So, he removed the level between him and the party vice-president and Delhi in-charge Prabhat Jha
 uske baad to shah ne teji se chaalen chalin
 Surprising everyone after a total of 100 hours of thinking, he included Kiran Bedi, AAP leaders Shazia Ilmi and Vinod Kumar Binny in BJP
 phir, uttar-pashchim dilli se congress kii purv saansad tathaa manmohan singh sarkaar main mantri rah chukin krishna tirath ko bhi bijepi main khinchaa
 Finally, on January 19, Kiran Bedi was declared the bjp's chief ministerial candidate
 sthaneey ikai main kiran kii ummidavaari par asantosh ke dabe swar uthne lage to shah ne dilli kii saaton loksabhaa siton kii booth cametiyon or panna prahariyon kii baithak bulaai
 On 25 and 27 January, they met all the leaders and full-time workers and asked that they decide that the Panna Sentinel must make at least four visits to every house before the election
 lekin kuch hi dinon main kiran bedi ke badbolepan ne kendriya netritv ko chintaa main daal diya
 a BJP central leader said, "he should have spoken less
" '' phir, modi or shah ne apane prachaar abhiyaan ke bhaashanon main kiran bedi kii charchaa kam kerani shuru kii
 Instead, the attack on Kejriwal intensified
 aise main dilli vidhansabha chunaav kii patakatha loksabhaa chunaav kii tarj par likhi jane lagi, jab modi ke pratidwandvi apane agenda kii bajaae modi par hamale kar rahe the
 This gave Modi a chance to present himself as a victim
 uske baad jo hua vah itihaas he, jisaki vivechna aaj bhi itihaaskaar, raajnneeti ke pandit or aankada visheshgy kar rahe hai
 So, is this view reversed this time? Or will Shah's electoral machine show charisma in Delhi elections? This question is the biggest today, the effects of which can be far-reaching

 Imran Khan's statement comes at a time when the Narendra Modi government has made it clear that terror and dialogue cannot happen simultaneously
 pichley maheene videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne spasht taur par kaha tha ki pakistan ke saath kisi bhi tarah kii baatcheet tab tak shuru nahin kii ja sakati jab tak vah bharat ke khilaaf seemaa paar aatanki gatividhiyon ko band nahin kar detaa

 i have ordered my government to know the status of this case
 is cese ko suljhaana hamaare liye jaruri he, kyonki yah ek aatanki hamalaa tha
 'nearly 10 years after the incident, Pakistan's top leadership has admitted that Lashkar terrorists were involved in the terrorist attack in Mumbai
 bharat mumbai hamale ko lekar pakistan ko dheron saboot de chukaa he, lekin pakistan kii ore se koi karrwai nahin kiye jane par donon deshon ke rishton main kisi str kaa sudhaar nahin ho sakaa he
 India has already been demanding action against Lashkar chief Hafiz Saeed, while Saeed is still roaming freely in Pakistan

 In an interview in 'washington's ruling party anti-muslim' Washington Post, Imran hoped that after the Lok Sabha elections in May next year in India, the process of dialogue will resume
 unhone kaha, ' (bharat ke) sattadhari dal kaa rukh muslim virdohi or pakistan virdohi he
 He rejected all my initiatives

 (the author is a professor at Jindal Global Law School) abhinayta salmaan khan ke khilaaf saal 2002 ke hit and ran maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue shuukravaar ko mumbai kii ek adaalat ne salmaan kii apil khaarij karte hue kaha ki bayaan darj kiye jate samay adaalat main media kii maujuudagi rahegi
 However, the court also instructed the media to show only the facts in the news related to the case, but refrained from discussing the merits of the case
 'dabang' khan ne shuukravaar ko adaalat se apil kii thi ki unka bayaan darj karte samay adaalat main media ke pravesh par pratibandh laga diya jaae
 On Salman's appeal, Additional Sessions Judge D
 dablyoo
 Deshpande did not ban the entry of media, but asked him to show the news of the case in a factual manner
 salmaan khanko 2002 ke hit and ran maamle main shuukravaar ko pehali baar kathghare main khadey hue
 He pleaded in his defense during the hearing, as well as the circumstances in which the accident occurred
 salmaan khan ne jaj ke saamne kaha ki vaardaat kii raat wo gaadi nahin chalaa rahe the
 His driver Ashok was driving the car
 unhone is baat kaa bhi daawa kiya ki us raat unke driver ne sharaab nahin pi thi
 Salman Khan said that three to four people were in the car that night
 unhone kaha ki gaadi driver chalaa rahaa tha or wo driver kii saath kii seat par baithe the
 Singer Kamal Khan and police constable Ravindra Patil were seated behind him
 salmaan ne court ko bataaya, 'accident ke baad left said kaa darwaja, jahaan main baitha tha, jam ho gaya tha or khul nahin paa rahaa tha
 So i landed through the side door of the driver seat
 salmaan ne kaha ki wo mauka-e- vaardaat se bhaage nahin the
 They stayed there for more than 15 minutes after the incident
 aapako bataa den ki salmaan par aarope he ki unhone 2002 main apni car ek dukaan se takaraa di thi, jisamen ek vyakti kii maut ho gai thi or chaar anya ghayal ho gaye the
 The incident took place on 28 September 2002
 aaj salmaan khan ko court main apana paksh rakhane kaa mauka mila
 The sessions court is hearing afresh after a magistrate added charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder in the case
 is aarope ke tahat 10 varsh tak sajaa ho sakati he
 In this case, the RTO and Excise Department said in their reply that Salman Khan had drunk outside his house and then drove an SUV car, even though he did not have a driving license
 jammu evam kashmir ke ek mantri ne shanivaar ko kaha ki rajya sarkaar ko bhi chahie ki vah upabhoktaaon ko varsh main nau silendar uplabdh karaae
 State Consumer and Public Distribution Minister Qamar Ali Akhun said that the state cabinet has to take a decision in this regard
 6 silendar dene kii hui thi ghoshnagyaat ho ki centre sarkaar ne pichley saptaah prayek parivaar ko varsh main sabsidi vaale rasoi gas ke chah silendar dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The Congress later said that Congress-ruled states would give nine cylinders to each family in a year
 akhun ne kaha ki main mahasoos karata hum ki jammu evam kashmir ko bhi chahie ki vah upabhoktaaon ko rasoi gas ke teen atirikt silendar de
 Wise people have always believed that one should not think too much about the past
 deepika padukonmen yahi samajhadaari kuta-kootakar bhari hui he
 They give examples of this from time to time
 kuch dinon pehle ek din achaanakaranbir kapuurase ek party main unka aamanaa-saamana ho gaya, jise kuch log maanate hai ki yah ittefaq tha or media maanata he ki sab kuch fiks tha
 Whatever Deepika Padukone did to Siddharth Mallya, it seemed Kidipika would be very emotional after finding her old lover and might even shed tears (in a TV show she has done so before)
 lekin is maukey par aisa kuch hua nahin
 a friend of Deepika told Fakhr that she is intelligent and does not hang on to the past
 isi dost ke mutabik, vah mulaakaat ittaphacan thi, jise deepika ne puri sahajata se liya or ranbir se hai-hello kii
 According to this friend, both of them are still friends and keep in touch with each other
 haalanki ranbir kai maukon par isse saaf manaa kar chuke hai
 Deepika's friend finally said the best thing
 uskaa kahana tha ki deepika bahut practical kism kii hai or apane jajbaton ko kaabo main rakhti hai
 That fellow said very rightly, otherwise the names of Deepika and Dhoni and Ranbir Kapoor to Siddharth Mallya are not included in the list of Deepika

 The Kejriwal government has reiterated in its affidavit in the High Court about dengue and chikungunya in the capital Delhi that not a single death occurred in Chikungunya in Delhi till 10 September
 jabaki mangalvaar ko dilli ke swasthya mantri satyendra jain ne daawa kiya tha ki chikangunia se kisi bhi vyakti kii maut ho hi nahin sakati he
 There have been reports of death of chikungunya patients one after another in Delhi
 vahi dilli hai court main die dilli sarkaar ne apane halafname main yah daawa kiya he ki 10 sitambar tak rajdhani dilli main chikangunia se ek bhimautanhin hui he
 Apart from this, the Delhi government also rejected the claim of the petitioner that Delhi is severely affected by dengue
 is bich dilli hai court ne maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue yachikakarta ko do din main yah bataane ko kaha he ki dilli sarkaar or civik agesiyon kodengue or chikanguniyaake saath-saath malaria kii rokthaam ke liye kya-kya kadam uthaane chahie
 So far, 1057 Chikungunya patients have been reported in Delhi
 The Delhi government has stated in its affidavit that 1158 cases were reported till September 10, out of which 804 were out of Delhi in Delhi and 354 Delhi hospitals
 jabaki dilli main chikangunia ke 1057 marij ab tak saamne aae hai
 The Delhi government has claimed in the court that adequate beds and medicines have been provided in Delhi's hospitals to prevent dengue and chikungunya
 sarkaar kaa daawa- 24 ghante kaam kar rahe hai 26 fever clinicsdilli sarkaar ne 26 fever clinics banaae hai, jo 24 ghante kaam kar rahe hai
 In addition, 262 dispensaries have been formed, which are functioning from 8 a
m
 to 4 p
m
 1 06 aam aadmi mohalla clinics 8 se 2 baje tak kaam kar rahe hai
 Government hospitals have 1000 special beds
 saath hi nursing homes ko 10 se 20 fisadi bed badhaane ke liye kaha gaya he
 On September 20, the next hearing, on the other hand, says that there is a difference of ground reality between the ground reality and the Delhi government's claim
 ab 20 sitambar ko dilli hai court main dobaaraa is maamle par sunwaayee hogi
 In such a situation, it will be seen whether the Delhi government will stay on its stand or will put a new argument in the court
 das din pehle haa or naa ke bich aakhirkaar congress adhyaksh pad se rahul gandhi ke istife ke baad upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko congress kaa antarim adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 There is not much time for ten days, but there is a discussion that nothing has changed both inside and outside the Congress party
 haalanki is sabake bich sawaal yahi he ki sonia gandhi antarim adhyaksh hai or iske baad koun? charchaa sirf yahi nahin, ek or charchaa modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal kii bhi ho rahi he or kaha ja rahaa he ki duusare kaarykaal main sarkaar kahin adhik majboot he
 So at the same time, comparison is being made for the Congress in such a way that the Congress has reached the second term of the Modi government at a worse time than the first term of the Modi government
 koun hoga aglaa adhyaksh?sonia gandhi ko saal 1998 main congress kii kaman saunpi gai thi or vah 2017 tak apane pehle kaarykaal main adhyaksh raheen
 During this time the Congress won the Lok Sabha elections twice and formed its government in many states
 sonia ke baad rahul gandhi kaa adhyaksh bananaa tay tha lekin rahul gandhi ke istife ke baad congress ko koi or nayaa cheharaa hi nahin mil paaya
 For almost a month, the party continued without a president and finally again Sonia Gandhi was appointed as the interim president of the Congress
 uski padi vajah thi ki congress party gandhi parivaar kii dhuree ke aas-paas hi gumti he or parivaar se itar agar koi adhyaksh banataa to congress main tut kaa khatra paidaa hota
 Nothing is clear on when Rahul Gandhi will be ready to take charge of the Congress again
 sonia gandhi ke baad gandhi parivaar se baahar kaa koi shaks party kii kaman sanbhaalega, isaki ummid bhi kam he
 In such a situation, the challenge before the party is serious because Sonia Gandhi is already struggling due to health reasons as well as her growing age can also be hindered by activism
 agar unke baad adhyaksh pad kaa nayaa vikalp nahin talasha gaya to party bikhar sakati he
 How will the victory in the states After the embarrassing defeat in 2014, the Congress won the trust in the public by winning the assembly elections of 3 states, but a year later, the Congress had the same fate in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 saal 2018 main congress ne bijepi se madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh jaise rajya bhale hi chhine lekin 2019 main haar ke saath hi karnataka uske haath se nikal gaya
 The rebellion of the Congress mlas has brought lotus into this state of the South again
 aane vaale ek saal main dilli, haryana or maharashtra jaise rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 The party is facing a serious leadership crisis in all three states
 haryana main maujuuda khatter sarkaar se mukaable ke liye party ke cheharaa abhi tay nahin he
 Former Chief Minister Bhupendra Hooda is trying to declare himself as the chief ministerial candidate in front of the Congress high command and for this, he has also beaten the rhythm
 duusari ore dilli main purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ke nidhan ke baad congress puri tarah netritv viheen ho chuki he
 Here too it will have to overcome the Aam Aadmi Party with a large majority and BJP with 7 mps
 maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena ke gathbandhan ke saamne congress-ensipi kaa saath kaaphi pichad chukaa he
 It is difficult to say on whose face the Congress will place a bet in front of bjp's young Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra
 siten badhin, saath main chunauti bhi
 
 
 In this Lok Sabha election, the number of mps of the party increased from 44 to 52, but veteran Congress leaders had to face defeat
 yahaan tak ki party ke tatkaaleen adhyaksh rahul gandhi apni paramparaagat seat amethi se haath dho baithe
 From Congress party leader Mallikarjun Kharge in the Lok Sabha to veteran Congressmen who were ministers in the UPA government, the bjp's storm has not had any merit
 loksabhaa main 303 saansadon ke saath bijepi zyada majboot hokar satta main lagaataar duusari baar waapas ai jahaan philhal endie ke paas congress se kareeb 7 guna adhik saansad hai
 At the same time, by next year, the BJP will get majority in the Rajya Sabha and the Congress will shrink in the upper house
 ek ore modi sarkaar apane duusare kaarykaal main prachand bahumat ke bal par kade or bade faisle le rahi he to duusari ore congress vipakshi kheme ko bhi ek saath laane main vifal rahi
 During the voting on the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill and the Triple Talaq Bill in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress could not put non-nda parties against the government
 iskaa nateeja hua ki modi sarkaar ne bahupratikshit teen talaak bill ke alaava jammu kashmir se dhara 370 hataane kaa aitihaasik faisla lekar apane drudhnishchiya ko pradarshit kar diya he
 In the coming assembly elections, BJP will try its best to capitalize on it which can pose a big challenge for the Congress
 jab baahar ai andar kii kalhasanghathan ke taur par congress philhal ekajute bhale hi dikh rahi ho lekin netaaon ke bayanon se saaf he ki party ke kai bade netaa party kii har line se sahamat nahin hai
 For example, after the removal of Article 370 from Kashmir, there were 2 tear openings in the Congress
 rahul gandhi ke kareebi jyotiraditya sindhiya se lekar purv sanghathan mahasachiv janardan dvivedi or yuva congressi deependra hooda ne modi sarkaar ke is faisle kaa samarthan kar diya jabaki congress mukhar hokar is faisle ke khilaaf khadi he
 Not only this, going against this decision, the Chief of the party in Rajya Sabha, Bhubaneswar Kalita even gave his resignation from the Congress
 modi sarkaar ne duusare kaarykaal kii shuruyaat se hi ek ke baad ek gol dagkar congress ke baikfoot par khadaa kar diya he
 Even before the Congress can overcome the Lok Sabha elections, the party is facing many new challenges
 aane vaale vakt main yah mushkilen or badhengi kyonki baari bahumat se saath jitkar ai bijepi apane kade faislon kii badaulat congress par or bhi baari padane vaali he

 The Sikh riots that took place in 1984 after the assassination of Indira Gandhi could not save the stain of the riots till date, Congress Party Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has given such a statement about the 1984 Sikh riots, which has raised many questions
 manmohan singh ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki tatkaaleen grahamantri pivi narsimha raav ne agar samay rahete hue indra kumaar gujral kii salaah maani hoti, to 1984 main hue sikh dange ko taala ja saktaa tha
 This means that the stain of the Sikh riots which has hit the Congress, now the party wants to put it on Narasimha Rao
 manmohan singh ne purv pradhanmantri indra kumaar gujral kii 100veen jayanti par yojit kaarykram main bolte hue kaha ki gujral ne 1984 ke sikh dangon ko rokane ke liye sena ko tainaat karne kii salaah di thi, lekin tatkaaleen grahamantri narsimha raav ne unki is salaah ko nazarandaaj kar diya tha
 Gujral had also met Home Minister Narasimha Rao on the night of the Sikh riots
 manmohan singh ne kaha, 'indra kumaar gujral sikh dange se pehle ke maahaul ko lekar behad chintitathe or raat main tatkaaleen grahamantri narsimha raav ke paas gaye the
 Gujral had advised Narasimha Rao that the situation was very serious
 lihaaja sarkaar ko jald se jald sena ko bulaanaa chahie or tainaat karnaa chahie
 If Narasimha Rao had accepted Gujral's advice, the 1984 Sikh massacre could have been averted
 'indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad sikh dangadarasal punjab main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne aatankwaad ke safaaye ke liye oparation bluestar chalaaya tha
 Due to this, Indira Gandhi was assassinated on 31 October 1984 by her angry Sikh security personnel and anti-sikh riots broke out in Delhi and other parts of the country from the very next day
 sikh dangon ke baad 19 november,1984 ko indira gandhi ke uttaradhikari unke putr rajeev gandhi boat club main ikattha hue logon ke hujum ke saamne kaha tha, 'hamen maaloom he ki logon ke andar kitna krodh he, lekin jab koi bada ped girtaa he to aasapaas kii dharti hilti he
 '84 riots blamed on the Congress, after this statement, there was a lot of resentment towards Rajiv Gandhi in the Sikh community
 aisa mana gaya ki rajeev kii dangaiyon ke prati hamadardi thi or unhone sikh samudaay ke katlo-gaarat ko utani gambhirtha se nahin liya jis rup main liya janaa chahie tha
 Rajiv Gandhi's statements to Sikh riot victims felt like sprinkling salt on the wounds
 bijepi or akali dal jaise kai vipakshi partiyaan aaj bhi aksar rajeev gandhi ke is bayaan ko kot karte hai or congress ke khilaaf hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal karte hai
 The 1984 Sikh riots have become a sore throat of the Congress
 sonia gandhi se lekar rahul gandhi tak 1984 dange ke liye sikh samudaay se maafee maang chuke hai
 Despite this, the ghost of the riots is not giving up the pursuit of Congress
 aise main manmohan singh kaa gujral kii jayanti ke maukey par sikh dangon par diya gaya bayaan kya is daag ko narsimha raav ke maththe par madhne kii ranneeti kaa hissaa to nahin he? The Supreme Court has tagged the petition filed on the validity of the Land Acquisition Act in the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute case with the main case
 is maamle par faisla sunaate hue chif justise ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki jo kuch kahana he wo samvidhan peeth ke saamne kahen
 The validity of the Land Acquisition Act was questioned by many Ram devotees, along with the Hindu Mahasabha Kamlesh Kumar Tiwari
 is yachika main kaha gaya he ki 1993 main 67
 The Center never had the right to acquire 7 acres of land as the land is a state subject
 lihaaja, centre sarkaar apni yojana ke liye rajya kii jameen adhigrahit nahin kar sakati
 Land acquisition in 1993 was illegal
 isse pehle supreme court main chal rahe ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid cese ko lekar centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apni yachika main kaha ki ayodhya main jo gaiyr vivaadit sthal he, use ramajnmabhumi nyaas ko waapas saunp diya jaae
 The land on which there is a dispute over the ramjanmabhoomi-babri Masjid should be kept by the Supreme Court
 modi sarkaar ne supreme court se daakhil apni yachika main kaha tha ki ayodhya main hindu pakshakaron ko jo hissaa diya gaya, vah ramajnmabhumi nyaas ko saunp diya jaae
 While 2
 77 acre bhoomi kaa kuch hissaa bharat sarkaar ko lautaa diya jaae
 Nearly 70 acres of land is owned by the central government near the ramjanmabhoomi-babri Masjid land dispute
 isamen se 2
 The Allahabad High Court ruled on 77 acres of land
 lekin jis bhoomi par vivaad he vah jameen 0
 There is only 313 acres
 supreme court ne 1993 main is jameen par ste laga diya tha or yahaan par kisi bhi tarah kii ectvity par roak laga di
 The Supreme Court is hearing a bench of 5 judges comprising Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Ashok Bhushan, Justice Abdul Nazir, Justice SA Bobde and Justice DY Chandrachud

 The Chinese capital was transformed into a huge smoke lot in the fall of 2010 for three consecutive days
 us dauraan sadak ke niyamit rakrakhaav ke ek kaam ne duniya kaa sabase lanbaa trephic jam laga diya tha
 It was a 100-kilometer long jam that stretched from Beijing to the province of Hebei, in which cars were taking all day to travel two kilometers
 is jam ko khulne main kul 10 din lage
 The crisis was not yet averted
 jam laga hua tha
 Exactly three days later there was heavy rain that cleared the smoke and dust but stopped Beijing's traffic again
 aadhe din se zyada vakt tak 4,321 sadakon par jam laga rahaa
 These two events forced traffic and environmental planners to review the city's traffic policy that had not changed since the 2008 Olympic Games
 olympic ke dauraan beijing ne pradooshan kam karne ke liye sam or visham gadipoon vaali vyavastha kuch samay ke liye lagu kii thi jiske baad maujuuda vyavastha lagu kii gai jisamen shahar ke logon ko hakrate main ek din car lekar baahar nikalnaa manaa hota he
 Ping Quinn, a professor at Renmin University, who has researched Beijing's traffic policy, says these measures were initially attractive because pollution levels were reduced in the first year and there was relief in the jam
 shahar main license plate par nigaah rakhane ke liye 2000 camere lagaae gaye the
 Most of the system was automated as the government felt that if this work was left in the hands of the traffic police, then there would be scope for corruption and traffic would be disrupted
 ulanghan karne vaali gaadi par 100 aarambi yani 1000 ru
 Was fined and the money was deducted from the driver's online account
 bhugtan na hone par license waapas le liya jaataa tha
 Ping says that within three years, the level of traffic has become the same
 ve kahati hai, “bilkul vaisaa hi jaisaa mexico city main hua tha
 "when they started banning cars," she says, ten years later, the city became more polluted and crowded as people were buying other vehicles
 beijing main bhi aise hi sakshya mili ki puraani gadipoon kaa bazaar achaanak tej ho gaya tha
 The government then decided against further restricting the even-odd system
 jaankaar bataate hai ki is kadam ke peeche teen kaaran the
 The first is that the planners felt the move could spark the ire of China's middle-class and troubled travelers (despite Beijing having the world's longest subway system that is 600 kilometers long) - for planners in the Communist Party of China This possibility does not go well for those who remain alert to dissatisfaction
 duusare, isse puraani kaaron kii kharid or zyada bad jaati
 Therefore, the government came up with another solution and it limited the number of vehicles registration every month
 shanghai pehla chini shahar tha jisane singapore kii tarj par masik nilaamee pranali shuru kii
 These measures have been very effective due to which the jam has reduced and the local governments have received huge inflow of money as the cost of registration is now one lakh RMB i
e
 10 lakhs
 tak ja pahunchi he
 Beijing took a more flexible view of the matter and decided to issue 17,600 registrations every month from the lottery
 ping kahati hai, “jam kam hua he or vaahanon kii vruddhi bhi sust hui he
 “the third reason was the study done by the government on the sources of pollution, which found that vehicles accounted for only one-third of the total emissions
 adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki is vajah se sam-visham vaali baadhyataa se hone vaale laabh samoochee vaahan chaalak aabaadi ko pareshaan karne ke lihaaj se behad maamuli honge
 Pollution caused mostly by cars 31
 1 fisadi tha jabaki baaki utsarjan ke liye koyala (22
 4 per cent), other industrial emissions (18
 1 fisadi) or dhul (14
 3 per cent) was responsible
 beijing main dopahiyaa vaahanon se pradooshan kaa sawaal hi nahi uthta kyonki shahar main keval bydaree se chalane vaali electric bikon kii hi anumati he
 Dong Liancai, who runs a climate and energy promotion campaign in Beijing for Greenpeace, says the government's focus is on limiting coal-fired industries rather than road traffic and improving emissions standards
 unhone bataaya, “sarkaar ne kai utsarjan maanak jari kiye, ek paryaavaran or vaayu pradooshan kanoon banaaya (jo ulanghan karne waalon ke liye dand kaa praavdhaan karata he) or beijing ke bheetar chaar main se teen koyala chaalit sanyantron ko band kar diya
 “the last plant is to be closed in early 2016
 dong kaa shodh bataata he ki iske chalate saal ke pehle nau maheenon main piem 2
 The level of 5 fell by 12 per cent over the previous year
 yah baat alag he ki disambar ke shuruaati do hafte main beijing kii tasviir kuch ulat dikhi jab ek baar phir puure shahar par dhundh ke badal chaa gaye
 On December 7, the government issued a "red alert" for smoke for the first time
 chaar shreniyon vaali chetavanee pranali main yah sarvocch tha jiske tahat skool band kar die jate hai, sara nirmaan kaary roak diya jaataa he or asthaayee rup se sam-visham numberplate vaali vyavastha lagu kar di jaati he
 Behind this three-day red alert was the forecast for the next three days in which PM2
 5 ke str ko 200 ke paar bataaya gaya tha
 Health experts and green groups welcomed this warning
 china main vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke pratinidhi barnard sawartlander ne kaha, “pehla, yah logon main pradooshan ke staron kii gambhirtha kaa sandesh detaa he; duusare, yah sarkaar ke turant pradooshan str kam karne ke liye kuch kadamon ko protsaahit karata he- masalan, nirmaan sthalon or kaarkaanon kii bandi or yaatyaat pratibandh, ityadi
 "the boom in air pollution came from the increased energy demand and the energy generated by burning coal, which was supposed to keep Beijing's central heating system running in the harsh winter," Dong explains
 ve kehete hai, “is chetavanee ke baavjood isamen koi shaq nahin ki hawa kii gunvattta main lambii avadhi main kaaphi sudhar aayaa he
 "beijing's war against smoke is not over yet, but it is certain that its war is going in the right direction

 The relationship between Google Play and malware is old
 google inhen hataane kii puri koshish karata he, lekin samay samay par play store par aidware or mailaware vaale eps mil jate hai
 Google has recently removed many apps from the Play Store
 ek baar phir se report aa rahi he ki google ne play store se kuch 210 eps hataa liye hai
 Researchers at the security firm Checkpoint discovered that these apps were actually influenced by adware
 aidware aise software hote hai jo pop ke jariye khud se aapako vigyaapan dikhaate hai or iske liye kisi parmishan kii bhi jarurat nahin hoti he
 It is actually made for computers, but now such apps are also found in smartphones
 report ke mutabik ye android aidware duniya bhar ke 15 karod divaais main paae gaye hai
 This alleged Simbad malware was created for some mobile gaming including Real Tractor Farming Simulator, Heavy Mountain Bus Simulator 2018 and Snow Heavy Excavator Simulator
 inamen se har eps paanch million baar se zyada downlod kiye gaye hai
 While one of these has been downloaded more than 10 million times
 aise karke tot 210 eps mili the jinhen google ne ab play store se hataa liya he
 Researchers say that the ability in simbad is that it can be divided into three groups - show ads, fishing and exposure to other applications
 iske jariye simbad mailaware ko banane vaale ataikar multiple plateforms ke liye fishing pej bana sakate hai or unhen broujar main open kar sakate hai
 Overall, through this, users can be directly victims of fishing
 fishing se aapkaa yujaranem or password aasaani se chori kiya ja saktaa he
 a question also arises as to why this happens repeatedly with the Google Play store
 google play store par eps aplod hone se pehle company iskaa rivyuu karti he or iske liye bhi process hai
 But it is believed that Google's review process is still weaker than Apple's review process
 isliye aipal ap store main aisi dikkatein hameshaa nahin aati hai
 If you have such apps in your smartphone too, remove them without delay and before installing any app, check its publisher and make sure that it is a credible app or not

 pehali stage kii pariksha main maths, general aveyaness, general intelligence or rijning or general science se sawaal aae the
 In such a situation, it is wrong to say that the paper was non-technical
 notification main ye bataaya gaya tha ki pehle stage kii pariksha screening nechar kii he or is pariksha main aane vaale sawaal shaikshanik yogyata ke aadhaar par honge
 Normalized marks obtained by the candidates will be used only to shortlist for the second stage examination

 It is once again clear that the candidates who have qualified the first stage of CBT; For example, those who bring 40 per cent in general category, OBC 30 per cent, SC 30 per cent and 25 per cent in ST category will be shortlisted on merit only if they fall within the limit of 15 times the total vacancy
 aapako bataa den ki jei pariksha kaa rigelt aane ke baad kai ummidavaaron nechayan prakriya par sawaluthae
 Candidates say that Junior Engineer is a technical post but the pattern of examination was non-technical (general) due to which many candidates failed in the examination

 Starting this new campaign, he has said that your watchman is standing strong in the service of the country
 saath hi apane samarthakon se apil kii ki ve 'main bhi chaukeedaar' kaa sankalp len
 This counterattack by the BJP is exactly the same as it was during the Gujarat assembly elections
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke prachaar main naaron kii jo jabardast jaaduugari shuru hui thi, vah chunaav-dar chunaav nikharati chali gai
 In the assembly elections held in the meantime, many slogans were chanted for the attack
 2017 ke aakhir main gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan soshal media par viral 'vikaas pagalaa gaya he' naaraa bhi chunavi jugalbandi kaa hissaa bana
 All anti-bjp leaders including Congress President Rahul Gandhi used the slogan Vikas Pagla Hai from their meetings

 The common people along with the leaders used the slogan Vikas Pagla Hai, sharing pictures related to all other issues including pits of roads
 vipaksh ke is aarope ke jawaab main bijepi ne baqayada ek video campan chalaaya or 'main hum vikaas, main hum gujarat' naaraa diya

 jisamen sonia gandhi se lekar lalu yadav or mulaayam singh yadav par parivaarwaad ke aarope lagaate hue piem modi ko svachh bharat jaisi muhim chalaane vaala yashasvi netaa bataaya gaya
 It was also said that if Modi fails today, no PM will dare to fight corruption for 100 years
 'main bhi chaukeedaar''main hum vikaas, main hum gujarat' jaisaa hi naaraa ab bijepi ne 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye diya he
 In fact, the Congress is blaming PM Narendra Modi directly for this, alleging corruption in the Rafale deal
 piem modi ne khud ko desh kaa chaukeedaar bataaya tha, jisko aadhaar banaate hue congress 'chaukeedaar chor he' kaa naaraa istemaal kar rahi he

 Raza is a scientist as well as a sensitive human being and this sensitivity has come out through his eyes
 bataur kavi yah raza kaa doosraa sangrah he magar wo ek manze chintak bhi hai or shabdon ke jaadugar bhi
 He has experience of life and of course also of work and the syrup he has prepared from his two experiences together is absolutely perfect

 His lawyer in the High Court said during the hearing that the CBI had closed the case itself, arguing that there was no evidence
 lekin sarkaar badalte hi cese darj kar liya gaya
 The CBI registered a case for preliminary investigation following a petition filed by the Common Cause organization in this case
 sibiai ne khud court ko bataaya tha ki aisa koi bhi sakshya nahin he jisase unke khilaaf koi maamla banataa ho
 After this, after changing the government at the center, the CBI started the investigation by registering the case again
 saaf he ki ye raajnneeti se prerit hokar maamla darj kiya gaya he
 Pratibha Singh's lawyer said that no corruption case is made against her and the CBI action is illegal
 aise main darj cese ko khaarij kiya janaa chahie
 Even when the CBI raided his client's residence, no objectionable documents and evidence were recovered, the arguments in this case would continue
 gauratlab he ki himachal pradesh hai court ne virbhadra singh kii yachika par ek oktober 2015 ko apane antarim aadesh main unki giraftaar, poochtacha yaa court kii ijaajat ke bina is maamle main singh ke khilaaf charge shit daakhil karne par roak laga di thi
 The CBI challenged the decision in the Supreme Court and the court transferred the case to the Delhi High Court, but the Supreme Court upheld the interim order of the court

 in nyaayamurtiyon kii ye bhi shikaayat he ki mukhya nyaayamurti sabhi ahm mukademen khud hi sun lete hai yani master of roster hone kaa phayda uthaate hai
 What is the whole matter? Let me tell you that Justice Loya was hearing the famous Sohrabuddin Sheikh case

 haal hi main kuch samay pehle ek megsine ne apni report main daawa kiya tha ki justise loya kii maut saadhaaran nahin thi balki sandigdh thi
 Since then, this matter came under discussion again
 lagaataar is mudde par raajnneetik bayaanbaji bhi jari rahi he
 However, Judge Loya's son Anuj Loya had expressed his displeasure at raising the issue by holding a press conference a few days ago
 anuj ne kaha tha ki unke pita kii maut prakritik thi, vah is masale ko badhanaa dene nahin chaahate hai

 Justice Rewa Khetrapal told the counsel of 86-year-old Tiwari that as per the orders of the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court, his clients would not be able to go out of the country unless they gave their blood for DNA testing
 uttar pradesh or uttarakhand ke purv mukhyamantri tiwari ko ucch nyaayalay or ucchtam nyaayalay diene jaanch ke liye rakt kaa namoona dene kaa nirdesh de chukaa he
 Justice Khetrapal said it would be appropriate to give Tiwari two days to tell whether he wanted to give blood samples for DNA testing or the court resorted to police force
 maamle kii agali sunwaayee 16 may ko hogi
 Meanwhile, the court asked the DNA Fingerprints and Diagnostic Center in Hyderabad to send the necessary kits for DNA testing to the court registrar
 adaalat ne tiwari ke vakil ke is anurodh ko thukraa diya ki is maamle main dehradun main rahane vaale congressi netaa se nirdesh lene ke liye ek saptaah kaa samay diya jaae

 adaalat ne kaha ki aap yaa to yah bayaan den ki tiwari desh chhodkar nahin jaaenge anyathaa main unpar roak laga duungi

 rohit kaa kahana tha ki adaalat tiwari ko khun kaa namoona jald se jald dene ke liye majaboor kare taaki pichley chaar varsh se chal rahe pitrutv sambandhi is maamle ko hal kiya ja sake
 The court was hearing a fresh petition filed by Shekhar, in which he had asked the court to ask Tiwari to give his blood sample for DNA test to ascertain whether he is Shekhar's biological father
 vayovruddh netaa ko is maamle main haal hi main ucch nyaayalay or ucchtam nyaayalay se koi raahat nahin mil pai
 Both courts refused to accept their intention not to give blood samples
 ucch nyaayalay kii do sadasyeey peeth ne kaha tha ki tiwari ko rakt kaa namoona dene par majaboor karne main police bal kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he kyonki nyaayik adeshon kaa paalan na hone se adaalaton kii ‘jagahansai’ hogi
 Tiwari had approached the Supreme Court against this order, but there was no relief from him
 shekhar ne apni yachika main kaha tha ki adaalat ke 27 april ke aadesh kii anupaalna ke liye adaalat ko ek ayukta kii niyukti kerani chahie taaki police kii sahaayta se tiwari ke rakt kaa namoona liya ja sake
 He had asked the court to stop Tiwari from going out of the country so that the court order could be followed
 shekhar ne 2008 main daakhil pitrutv maamle main kaha tha ki tiwari unke pita hai or adaalat unhen unka jaivik pita ghoshit kare
 The single judge and bench of the High Court had asked for a blood sample for DNA testing in the case

 Students at the Metropolitan College in Birmingham, England have been told not to wear any mask covering the face so that they can be easily identified at all times
 'haalanki kuch chaatraon ne is kadam kaa yah kehete hue swaagat kiya he ki isse ve zyada surakshit mahasoos karengi, jabaki anya ne ise betuka qaraar diya he

 Of Kozhikode resident of Kerala

 On 2 March, Yuvjan Shramik Rayathu Congress (YSRC) chief Jagan Mohan Reddy met Tridandi Chinna Jiyar Swamy in Hyderabad
 jaahir he, unhone andhra pradesh main hone vaale vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav main apni party kii chunavi safalataa ke liye aashirwad liya
 Interestingly, behind Jagan's meeting with Swami, the Chief Minister of Telangana and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) chief K
 chandrashekhar raav bhoomika nibhaa rahe the
 But, Jagan, who opposed the creation of a separate state of Telangana, and Chandrashekhar Rao, considered responsible for the bifurcation of the state in Andhra Pradesh, did not seem to fit into the closely held politics
 khaskar, tab jab andhra pradesh main loksabhaa or vidhansabha tathaa telugana main loksabhaa kaa chunaav hone main ek maheene se bhi kam samay bachaa he
 In fact, the door of the political equation between the two leaders is connected to Delhi, located 1,500 km from Hyderabad, where the entire opposition and each other were arch enemies to stop the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 The parties have also united against Modi
 aise main rajg sahyogiyon kii lagaataar ghatati sankhya or bache hue sahyogiyon kii mukharata se bhaajapa ko bharosemand bhavi sahyogiyon (chunaav baad samarthan dene vaali party) kii jarurat kaa ehsaas ho gaya he
 For this need, the NDA camp is trying to bring KCR and Jagan together and help them
 darasal, 2014 main centre main modi ke netritv main rajg sarkaar banane ke baad se is gathbandhan ke 14 dalon ne bhaajapa kaa saath chhod diya
 By the way, the BJP did get a strong ally in Bihar in the form of Janata Dal (united), but a large constituent (16 mps) walked out of the NDA clan as the Telugu Desam Party (TDP)
 rajg ke jo maujuuda sahyogi hai unamem shivasena, jad (you), shiromani akali dal or ol india anna dravid munetra kadgam (annadramuk) prabhavi to hai, lekin bhaajapa ke saath inkaa vishwaas kaa sankat puri tarah khatm nahin hua he
 BJP sources say the BJP no longer has the same trust with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 donon dalon ke rishte is had tak bighad chuke the ki shivasena ne pichley saal party kii kaaryakarini main yah prastaav tak paarit kar diya tha ki vah 2019 kaa loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav apane dam par ladegi
 Although the BJP somehow managed to save the alliance with the Shiv Sena, the disharmony between the workers of the two parties has reached a peak
 donon dalon main gathbandhan ke baavjood sthiti yah he ki maharashtra bhaajapa kii prabharee or mahasachiv saroj pandey ko party kaaryakarta, shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke ghar jaakar unase milane se rokte hai
 "thackeray talks only by giving equal status to Modi and Amit Shah," says a Maharashtra BJP leader
 bhaajapa ke anya netaa agar unke ghar jaakar unase milte hai to unhen baithne ke liye choti kursi di jaati he
 BJP workers feel insulted by seeing this
 donon dal sirf is vajah se saath aae hai taaki chunaav main unhen nuksaan nahin ho
 The lack of trust in both parties can be seen clearly
 ''bihar main aisi hi sthiti he
 The JD (U) and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) are currently in the nda's court, but the BJP had to fight hard to win the LJP
 haalanki kendriya rajyamantri giriraaj singh kehete hai, ''bhaajapa majboot sthiti main he, isliye rajg main shaamil sabhi dalon ko narendra modi ke netritv kaa laabh milegaa
 "but they do not forget to add," "if the BJP is not strong or Narendra Modi does not lead, then it is difficult to say which partner should stay together and leave when
" ''giriraaj ke is nazariye ko bihar bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa vyaavhaarik maanate hai
 He says, "ideally, parties with different opinions from BJP are with BJP as long as they feel the need of BJP for electoral victory
" chunaav ke baad koun-si party kahaan jaaegi, yah kahana mushkil he
 "in 2014, Upendra Kushwaha was with us," says a Union Minister of State, who hails from Bihar
 is baar ve rajd ke saath chale gaye kyonki vahaan unhen adhik phayda dikh rahaa he
 It is difficult to say whether another party will leave or come together tomorrow
 ''bhaajapa netaa yah bhi maanakar chal rahe hai ki jab tak siton par talmail nahin ban jaataa tab tak gathbandhan ke dalon main virodhabhasi swar sunai denge
 Who will contest on which seat in Bihar and Maharashtra, it has not yet been decided in the NDA
 chunaav kii taarikh ghoshit ho gai he, isliye sahyogi dalon kii ore se bhaajapa par siton ke talmail ko lekar dabaav badhata ja rahaa he
 The BJP leadership is assuming that the NDA will emerge in a new form after the Lok Sabha elections
 jaahir he, party is baat se bhi inkaar nahin kar rahi he ki kuch maujuuda saathi baahar ja sakate hai or kuch nae saathi party ke saath aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, the BJP feels the need to increase the NDA clan

 Narasimha Rao says, "in 2019, the BJP will win more than 300 seats on its own, so there is no need for more parties in the NDA
 jo hamaare saath hai ham unheen ke saath chunaav main jaaenge
 Even after his claim, senior party leaders admit that bjp's door is open to new allies
 jaahir he, siyaasi jaruraton kii vajah se kai dal chunaav purv gathbandhan main shaamil nahin hote hai, lekin chunaav baad aise dal saath nahin aaenge, yah jaruri nahin
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley says, "allies do not always mean parties in the government or coalition
 sansad main yaa sansad ke baahar bhi sarkaar ko un dalon kaa mudda aadhaarit samarthan bhi miltaa he jo kisi gathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin hote hai
 Many times, even among the parties involved in the anti-coalition, some parties have been giving issue based support to the government
 ''is siyaasi jarurat ko samajhate hue hi bhaajapa gathbandhan ko lekar plan bi par bhi kaam kar rahi he
 Under Plan B, the party is engaged in helping those parties, which can prove to be favorable for the BJP after the 2019 elections
 haalanki party is maamle main phoonk-foonkkar kadam rakh rahi he
 Says a senior party leader, "if for some reason the performance of the existing allies of BJP is not good in the elections, then what will be the option for us? For this it is necessary to keep pace with such parties or To be reconciled afresh, who are neither in the BJP camp nor in the Congress camp
 '' chunki gaiyr-bhaajapa or gaiyr-congress gathbandhan main shaamil dalon ne apane-apane siyaasi pattey saaf kar die hai, isliye ab spasht he ki telugana main tiares, andhra main viesarsi or odisha main biju janata dal 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad rajg ke nae saathi ban sakate hai

 Reliance Jio may be the fastest 4G network in India by trai's My Speed app and data, but according to a new report given by Open Signal, Airtel's 4G LTE is the fastest in India
 open signal ke april 2017 ke liye 'state of network' report main ye bataaya gaya he ki jeeyo ke 4G network kii uplabdhta sabase zyada he lekin speed ke maamle main airtel number van par he
 According to the open signal report, Airtel is number one in terms of 4G as well as it is also on top in terms of 3G speed
 iske alaava ye saare networks ke maamle main bhi lead kar rahaa he
 The report states that Airtel's average LTE downloading speed 11
 5 Mbps jo ki apane kareebi pratidwandi Vodafone or Idea 3 Mbps zyada fast he
 If you look at the chart of opensignal, then Reliance Jio LTE 3 in terms of downloading speed
 92mbps kii speed ke saath chauthe number par najar aayega,vodafone ke 8
 59mbps and 8 of Idea
 34mbps se bhi neeche
 If opensignal's report is compared with trai's data, there is a big difference, according to trai's myspeed app, Reliance Jio's average downloading speed 16 in March
 48 mbps thi
 However, opensignal's report also says that the average downloading speed of operators in India is much lower than the global level
