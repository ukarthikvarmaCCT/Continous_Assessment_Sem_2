 party kii is jeet kaa shrey aresas ko bhi diya gaya
 Now Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat has said that if the steps of the government are seen to be staggering, he will be given positive advice and suggestions from the Sangh
 kanpur ke pan
 Deendayal Upadhyaya, while addressing an intellectual session in the Sangh Dharma Vidyalaya running Sanatan Dharma Vidyalaya, said Bhagwat (mohan Bhagwat) said that those who come from the democratic system, they have a lot of rights
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki in adhikaron kaa kahin galat upyog kiya jaae
 Yes, if the government's steps are seen to be wavering, the Sangh will give them positive advice ' pehle main tumko apana parichay de duun
 i am 10 years old
 meraa naam anita he or dilli main rahati hum
 My teacher has trapped me in a project that has caused me a lot of struggle
 unhone mujhe 20 saal baad yani 2032 main bhartiya arthvyavastha kii tasviir par ek niabandh likhane ko kaha
 Even economists do not know this and they expected this from a 10-year-old girl
 maine hoshiyaari dikhaai or apni arthshaastri mummy se poocha
 He said, "look at the net
 search karo mil jayega
 Most economists also do the same
 '' maine jo kuch paaya, bataa rahi hum
 My mother helped me understand just a few things, everything else was present on the net
 pehali cheez, har desh kii aay alag karency main hoti he
 To compare these, they are converted into US dollars
 aisa karne ke do tareeke hai, ek aadhikarik vinimay dar yaa pipipi (parcheging power parity) vinimay dar ke hisaab se
 As India develops, the rupee will strengthen against the dollar
 lekin uske aage arthshaastriyon ko nahin pataa ki vinimay daren kisi rahengi
 Nor do they have any idea of the inflation at that time
 isiilie ve har baat dollar ke vartmaan mulya ke hisaab se karte hai
 India will become the world's third largest economy in 2032, with a total income of $ 7 trillion (today it is $ 2 trillion)
 number ek par china or number do par america isse bahut aage honge, haalanki rupaya agar majboot ho jaataa he to bharat kii kamai bad sakati he
 Secondly, India's population will cross one and a half billion and it will overtake China
 yani 7 trillian kii aay or zyada logon main bant jaaegi
 Thirdly, India's per capita income will be $ 4,500 (currently it is $ 1,400)
 maine apni maa se poocha ki kya isse bharat ek viksit arthvyavastha ban jayega? unhone kaha ki ''viksit'' iske liye galat shabd rahegaa, bharat 2032 tak ''viksit'' nahin ho paaegaa
 He will still be poor, though less than today
 bas nimna madhya aay varg se ucch madhya aay varg main chalaa jayega
 i did not understand the meaning of this until i discovered that the per capita income of Jordan and Turkmenistan is the same as that of India at that time
 mujhe to andaja hi nahin tha ki ye desh bharat se bhi amir honge
 i had no idea that in 2032, on an average India would be poorer than today's China
 chauthi baat, bharat ke bheetar bahut se antar honge or aaj jo khaaiyaan hai, ve pat nahin jaaengi
 The standard of living (per capita income) in Chandigarh, Goa, Puducherry or Delhi may be similar to today's developed countries, but Jharkhand will have poverty like today's Bangladesh
 chhattisgarh, jharkhand or orissa main phir bhi bahut garibi hogi
 Fifth, there is a thing called poverty line i
e
 minimum income to survive
 aaj kareeb 30 fisadi bhartiya garibi rekha se neeche hai (har koi apane-apane aankade pesh karata he)
 This will be less than 10 percent in 2032
 yani bhartiya kam garib, behatar shikshit or zyada swasth honge
 Sixth thing, more and more people will be living in Indian cities and agriculture will have about eight per cent of national income
 kuch log tab bhi kheti kar rahe honge lekin zyada log udyogon or seva kshetra main yogadan karte najar aaenge
 About 40 per cent of Indians will be living in cities and there will be around 70 cities with a population of over 1 million
 dilli kii aabaadi chaar karod hogi, jahaan main rahati hum
 i can't even imagine what Delhi would look like then
 mujhe lagata he ki dilli pados ke rajyon-uttar pradesh, rajasthan or haryana-tak fail jaaegi
 By that time, roads and traffic will become so much better that it will take just two hours to reach Agra, Chandigarh or Jaipur
 mujhe to lagata he ki haai speed train se chaar ghante main mumbai bhi pahunchaa ja sakegaa
 Seventh, what will happen to the slum then? What about the poor and inflation? i still see people fighting for water
 kai ke paas bijli nahin
 May be there are better schools (also virtual ones) and better health services
 shishu mrityu dar 15 (1,000 bacchon par) rah jaaegi
 Every child will be vaccinated and no child will be born at home
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki pani ke liye log tab bhi jhgadenge or mausam to pal-pal main badalegaa
 Will we then face the maximum temperature of 50 degree Celsius in summer in Delhi? Well, we all will have UID and the government will know who is poor so that they can be subsidized
 baaki sab log paise chukaa kar khaaenge, or mujhe to aisa lag rahaa he ki har cheez 350 ru
 Will be kg
 bijli bhi 15 ru
 The unit will be done
 hamaari kamai to zyada hogi hi, lekin har cheez or mahangi ho jaaegi
 Since i study in a good school and may go to America for further studies, it is so sure that i will get a good job by returning
 ab dusron ke bare main main kuch nahin kah sakati
 At that time, many of us would be searching for jobs in the job market and jobs would not be that much (my mother confused me by saying that everyone would get a job, it would be that everyone would get less on average)
 lekin main doosraa sawaal puch rahi hum
 Let's assume that the poor will live properly because the government will subsidize it
 maan lo ki amir bhi thik se rahegaa kyonki use achche vetan vaali acchhee naukari mil jaaegi
 But those who will be in the middle, will they get Rs 350
 kilo khaanaa kharid paaenge or 15 ru
 Will the unit be repaid for electricity? Mummy said don't worry
 unke mutabik, vaastavik aay vruddhi hameshaa sakaaratmak hoti he or yah mahangaai se zyada hi rahati he
 Eighth thing, my friend Adit read it and started asking about family life and career
 maine uske bare main to likhaa nahin kyonki vah to main jaanati hi nahin
 i know that i will probably work in a city other than Delhi and others will be working away from their birthplace
 main jaanati hum ki naukari anishchit rahegi or main naukari badalati rangi
 i know if i will get married late, or not
 main yah bhi jaanati hum ki adit ko bhi shaadi karne main dikkat aegi
 But his case is different
 vah to desh ke us hisse se aayaa he jahaan unhone sari betiyon ko maar daalaa he
 i know that i will not be able to meet my parents more than once a year
 agar main kisi bhi mahanagar main hui, to itnaa pataa he ki gharelu naukar khojane main mujhe bahut dikkat aegi
 At that time, i would see my parents trapped in a government department
 masalan, ab bhi kai aise kaam hai jinhen nibatane ke liye unhen daudna hota he
 i do not think that all such work will be digital
 agar mujhe vikalp diya gaya ki main apane mata-pita jaisaa jivan jeena chaahati hum yaa apni kalpana kaa, to main apana hi jivan chunungi
 i think i will have more reasons than my parents to be proud of being an Indian
 or agar maine shaadi kii, to mujhe ummid he ki meri bitiyaa bhi aisa koi niabandh likhane ko kahe jane par yahi sab baaten kahegi

 Pratibha said, "as the heir to this great legacy, it becomes our responsibility to strive for truth and justice, to keep our conduct in a manner that is consistent with India's image as a progressive and responsible country, where Democratic values, harmony and tolerance are fully loaded
 ’’pratibha ne kaha ki desh aaj ek aise mode par khada he jahaan aise bahut se mudde hai jin par dhyaan dene kii jarurat he or is baat kaa khyaal rakhane kii jarurat he ki mukhya udeshy se bhatak na jaayen

 The real strength of a country cannot be judged by the challenges it poses, but it is determined by how it responds to them
 raashtrapati ne kaha, ‘‘isaliye, jaisaa ki ham aankate hai, niti banaaiye, kanoon banaaiye, yojanaon ko amal main laaiye or kanoon lagu kijiye, hamen yah nahin bhoolanaa chaiye ki hamaara udeshy yah sunishchit karte hue pragati ke path par aage badhnaa he ki hamaare naitik mulyon or siddhanton main koi giravat na aaye

 Whether it is forbidden, it is necessary to be afraid, or 404, or Charles and i were released some time ago

 Review: 'dear Maya' is full of weak script and bad suspense
 See the film: - The film scares in installments

 Huma Qureshi's work is also simple
 - film kii sabase acchhee baat yah he ki isamen jabardastee vaale bhoot pret, tantra mantra nahin dikhaai dete hai
 Weak Links: - The film is the official Hindi remake of 'akules', but what was in the English film seems to be missing here
 - script ke level par or bhi zyada kaam karne kii jarurat thi
 The story revolves around a lot and there are many such frames that if you do not look closely, you can miss many things
 - film main flash back or pregent de ko darshane main thodi or ehtiyaat baratane kii jarurat thi, jo ki nahin ho paaya he or kaaphi kanfusion hi bani rahati he
 When the childhood blast took place in Kashmir in front of Huma Qureshi, the entire story was told in Box Office: The film cost about 10 crores

 In such a situation, it can be beneficial to do an internship during and after studying
 yahaan ham aapako bataa rahe hai ki behtareen internship kaise hasil kii ja sakati he
 1
 pehle se hi planning karen
 
 
 If you want to learn work by doing internship in your favorite company, then you always have to be updated
 us company kii website or soshal media pej ko dekhte rahanaa bhi phydemand ho saktaa he
 2
 company ke bare main sabakuch pataa kar len
 
 
 If you want to apply for a company, then you can be asked questions related to the company there
 aise main us company kaabecoground chekakarna phydemand ho saktaa he
 3
 rigeume or cover letters par dhyaan den
 
 
 Nowadays jobs and internships come on the basis of cover letter and resume rather than any recommendation
 aise main kisi jaankaar yaa phir visheshgy kii madad lenaa phydemand hoga
 4
 ssailing or grammer kii galtiyaan na karen
 
 
 Now everyone will understand that what spelling and grammar mistakes can affect the résumé
 aap apana byora safasuthari riting or grammer main likhen
 5
 khud ko positive rakhen
 
 
 Maybe you are worried because of not getting internship but do not express your frustration
 internship milane ke baad bhi positive rahane par naukari kii sambhaavnaaen bad jaati hai

 sanjay raut ne kaha ki unhen pradhanmantri par puraa bharosa he or kisi bhi rajya main bhrashtachar yaa mahilaon se jude aparaadh hote hai to pradhanmantri kaa dhyaan us par rahata he
 That is why he is hopeful that the BJP will not allow the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be tarnished and will take action against its Haryana president and remove him from the post
 sanjay raut neis maamle ko lekar bijepi netaa subramanyam swami ke court jane ko sahi tehraate hue kaha ki vah peedit ladki ko nyaay dilaane ke liye court ja rahe hai
 On Tuesday, Subramanian Swamy again reiterated that he has not backed down from his decision to file a PIL on the matter

 dilip kii pehali dialysis 2012 main hua tha jabaki bete kaa card 2010 main bana he
 ESIC, meant for the welfare of employees, has also started advocating here and is arguing that the kidney disease in AIIMS was caught 15 years ago and medicines were also being run
 iesaisi ke medical kamishnar dow esaaar chouhan daleel de rahe hai ki july 2014 main niyam main badlaav kiya gaya ki kidney or cancer agar purana marz he or card nayaa to ilaaj iesaisi nahin karegi
 The comments iesaisi ke nae kaayade kii shikaar rohinee kii 38 saal kii sona devi bhi hai
 The husband's card is from October 2013, while dialysis started the next year ie 2014, that too twice a week
 sona ke pati pramod factory main kaam karte hai or kehete hai ki koi chaara nahin
 Cannot get treatment because the cost of the month is 30 thousand
 ab to patni nae niyam kii bhent chadh jaaegi, mar jaaegi
 Another plea of ESIC is also about forgery
 haalanki jaankaron ke mutabik farji maamalon kii aad main duusare marijon ko suvidha se maharoom nahin kiya ja saktaa
 At the same time, there is also the question that an employee can get the card made, but when a disease starts, how will it be detected? The issue is not just about the New Testament, the issue is related to the breath of the breath and the question is about life and death
 is chote se badlaav ko lekar ek bada tabaka maut ke kagaar par he, jo laachaar he

 The Medical Commissioner of ESIC Dr SR Chauhan is arguing that in July 2014 the rule was changed that if the kidney and cancer are old merged and the card is new, then ISIC will not cure
 tippaniyan Sona Devi, 38, of Rohini is also the new victim of ESIC
 pati kaa card oktober, 2013 kaa he, jabaki dialysis agle saal yani 2014 se shuru hua, vah bhi hafte main do baar
 Sona's husband Pramod works in the factory and says there is no choice
 ilaaj nahin kara sakate kyonki maheene kaa kharch 30 hajaar kaa he
 Now the wife will die, will die
 iesaisi kii ek or daleel farjivade ko lekar bhi he
 However, according to experts, under the guise of fake cases, other patients cannot be denied convenience
 saath hi yah sawaal bhi he ki koi karmchaaree card to banavaa saktaa he par koi beemaari kab shuru hui, iskaa pataa kaise lagegaa? mudda sirf nae niyam kaa nahin, masalaa saanson kii door se judaa he or sawaal jindagi or maut kaa he
 a large section is on the verge of death for this small change, which is helpless
 iesaisi ke nae kaayade kii shikaar rohinee kii 38 saal kii sona devi bhi hai

 isroyal banane ke 69 saal baad pehali baar bharat kaa koi pradhanmantri isroyal gaya he
 In the last 69 years, the country saw 15 PM after succession, but no Prime Minister could show courage to go to Israel and the main reason behind this has been the politics of the country and our relations with Arab countries
 darasal modi se pehle bhi bhartiya pradhanmantriyon ne agar kabhi isroyal ko gale lagane kii sochi hogi to do khyaalon ne use roak diya hoga ek to muslimon ke man main isroyal ko lekar kadavaahat he to isroyal ke saath khadey kaise hua jaae or duusari taraf 80 lakh bhartiya shramik arab deshon main kaam kar rahe he to kahin 70 ke dashak kii tarj par arab world isroyal kaa saath dene waalon ke khilaaf naa ho jaae
 An important reason was also that the Congress was against the idea of the formation of Israel
 desh main zyaadaatar vakt congress satta main rahi or congress ko hameshaa laga ki isroyal se sambandh badhaane kaa matlab arab deshon ko khafa karnaa hoga, or isroyal se sambandh bharat main rah rahe musalamaanon ko bhi party se dur karegaa yani rajanyik sambandhon kii door kaa ek sira gharelu raajnneeti ke vot bank se bhi jud gaya
 BJP will not make any difference! On the other hand Muslim vote bank does not matter for BJP
 2014 ke chunaav nattejey iskaa saboot hai
 37 to Congress in 2014 election
 60 fisadi muslim vot mili lekin use mahaj 44 loksabhaa seat milin duusari ore bijepi ko 282 siton par jeet mili jabaki use mahaj 8
 4 percent Muslim vote
 muslim vot bank kaa khatra!vaise, isroyal se sambandh badhaane par muslim vot bank chhitak saktaa he ye dar to rajanyik sambandh banate vakt bhi uthaa tha, jab 23 janvari 1992 ko kendriya cabinet ne isroyal se rajanyik sambandh banane kaa anumodan kiya tha
 At that time, the then HRD Minister Arjun Singh warned that the Cabinet should see that Muslim vote banks should not be dispersed
 is baat kaa zikr tatkaaleen videsh sachiv je en dikshit ne apane sansmaran main kiya he
 Owaisi raised questions: Now foreign policy is changing, so Muslim leaders are also raising questions
 eimm pramukh asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki duniya main dharm ke aadhaar par do hi desh bane hai ek pakistan or doosraa isroyal
 Owaisi said this was the first time that an Indian delegation was going to Israel and would return without visiting Palestine
 ovaisi ne kaha ki bharat kii niti kabhi is tarah se nahin rahi he
 With this act of PM Modi, Israel will suppress Palestine more
 ovaisi ke sawaal apni jagah he lekin sachai ye he ki sambandho kii nai lakeer puraani lakeer ko mitaa rahi he
 New traditions are being established in foreign policy
 ummid yahi rakhni chahie ki isamen bharat ke hit sarvopari rahenge

 Shaina's memories are refreshed
 
 
 jab vah uttar pradesh ke gajiabad main shanti niketan public skool jaati thi, jahaan vah kabhi shikshika thi
 30 years old Shaina has undergone 19 surgeries since she last went to school nine years ago
 vah 2009 kaa agast kaa mahina tha
 Two men came to Shaina's office to discuss admission to a child's nursery
 jab shaayna ne unhen farm dene ke liye mudakar cabinet kholaa tabhi unhone ek steel kaa tiffin box kholaa or us par acid (tejaab) phenk diya
 It was a revenge for a man's refusal to marry
 is ghatana ne shaayna kaa puraa jivan badal diya
 The attack on Shayna was sudden and the incident caused the teachers to go down in flames
 yahi kaaran tha ki chikitsa sahaayta main deree hui
 Some suggested that water be poured on Shaina's body and someone said, pour milk
 shaayna yaad karti he ki vah atyadhik kshtdaayak dard tha
 His shirt fell out of the body like a burnt paper
 ek shikshika uske liye ek shawl laai or phir use aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Shaina was younger then
 kaksha 10 paas ho gai thi or ek praathmik vidhyalay main shikshak ke rup main bahut acchhee tarah se kaam kar rahi thi
 The school's founder also gave him additional administrative responsibilities
 vah tab shaadi ke bandhan main nahin bandhana chaahati thi

 She changes two autos, takes a metro and then walks to the hospital
 ab vah anya acid-hamale ke peediton kii sahaayta ke liye aspataal main apane samparkon kaa upyog karti he
 In the year 2013, Shayna attempted suicide
 vah balakani se kud gai thi
 She was depressed over fear of trauma, pain and an unknown future
 vah batch gai lekin isse uske jakhmi sharir kaa ek pair or tut gaya
 Today Shayna is full of positivity
 vah kahati he "aapako jivan keval ek baar mila he, or yah aap par nirbhar he ki aap jivan ko kaisaa bananaa chaahate hai

 There was a girl whom Asaram once used to refer to as his granddaughter, and there is this girl, whom he is referring to as his daughter, but seethe see that both these girls are neither ready to accept Asaram as grandfather nor father
 Equally, both of them are sitting against Asaram to open the box of charges, which is increasing their problems everyday

 According to police sources, in the nearly two-and-a-half-hour interrogation that took place in the ATS office after being brought from Jodhpur to Ahmedabad on Monday night, Asaram said that he does not even recognize the girl who filed a report against him, because many girls in his ashram She lives
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki jis ladki ko asaram apni beti samaan bataa rahe hai, akhir vahi ladki asaram ke khilaaf itnaa sangeen iljaam kyon laga rahi he? wo bhi tab, jab is vaardaat ko kai saalon kaa vaqt guzar chukaa he or wo ladki apane puure parivaar ke saath ek khushhaal jindagi ji rahi he

 After the serious interpretation of Gandhi in the country and the topology interpretation of 'munnabhai', now the film 'dear Friend Hitler', originally made in Delhi, has made history's most controversial character Hitler as the theme of the story
 film ke sah nirmaataa or abhinayta nalin singh ne bataaya, ‘hamane hitler jaise vivaadit charitra ke saath-saath subhash chandra bose or gandhi ko film ke kathanak ke bataur chunaa he
 The entire film runs on three tracks simultaneously, through which the historical relevance of Gandhi's philosophy has been highlighted through historical events filled with movements during the Second World War
 ’unhone kaha ki aitihaasik sandarbh vaali is film main hitler ko likhe gayi subhash chandra bose ke patr ko aadhaar banaaya gaya he, jo british shashan ke khatme ke liye hitler se milakar mitra rashtron ke khilaaf ladaai main bhaag lene ke himachati the
 Singh said that at a time when Hitler's path of violence was dominated all over the world, Gandhi adopted a unique experiment of non-violence
 film main gandhi ke us patr kaa bhi zikr he, jisamen unhone britain kii bhartsana karne ke saath hitler kii bhi bhartsana kii thi
 He used non-violence as a weapon for independence that further heightened Gandhi's political standing and made him relevant in today's global politics
 film main hitler kii bhoomika prasiddh abhinayta raghuveer yadav nibhaa rahe hai, jabaki hitler kii premika eva brown kii bhoomika main charchit abhinetri neha dhoopiya hai

 Nalin, who has researched the concept of the film, from her screenwriting to her for nearly two years, says that while studying at the University of Delhi, she learned a close-up of Hitler's character while doing a street play and reached out to the masses and his Seeing a curiosity about it, he thought of making a film on the subject when the time came
 unhone kaha, ‘film kaa nirdesan rakesh ranjan ne kiya he or yah unki bataur nirdeshak pehali film he, jabaki iske nirmaataa amrapali media vijan ke anil kumaar sharma hai
 Most of the actors in the entire film are from Delhi and set in Berlin in the suburbs of Delhi as well as the bunker in which Hitler lived in his last days
 ’film main hitler kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale prasiddh abhinayta raghuveer yadav ke bare main nalin kaa kahana he ki raghuveer apane charitra main itane khoye hue the ki shooting ke dauraan or shooting ke baad bhi unamem hitler jivit tha or kai choti choti baton par bhi hitler kaa tevar unamem jivit tha, jiske kaaran anekon baar glass tuutane kii ghatnayen hui
 Nalin explains that the main challenge to make this film was how to use different languages due to the presence of foreign characters
 jaise hitler ko hindi bolta dikhaanaa kaisaa hoga
 He said that in view of this confusion, the use of one language was included for all the characters
 lekin is film ko french, german, hindi, tamil, arabi, bangla sahit aath bhashaaon main dab kiya jaayegaa or up shishark kaa prayog kiya jaayegaa

 Chatterjee is of the opinion that its effect led to a crater as high as Everest, which is now under water and named Shiva after the god of creation and destruction
 takaraav ke kaaran hi hua mahavinashchatarji bharose ke saath kehete hai, yah koi sansani paidaa karne vaali kalpit vaigyanik katha nahin he balki ise hamane us maukey par jaakar samaj or hasil kiya he
 They believe that this collision probably resulted in the mass destruction known as K-T (cretaceous-tertiary)
 unke ye tark aam taur par prachlit jalpralay kii dharna ke vipareet hai
 Many scientists believe that the destruction of the dinosaurs was caused by the cavity of Chickasulab, off the coast of the Yucatán peninsula of Mexico
 lekin princeton vishvavidhyalay, america ke kuch vaigyanikon ne haal hi main is manyata ko naamanzoor kar diya kyonki pramaanon se prakat he ki vahaan ulkapind kaa takaraav dianasoron ke vinaash se 3,00,000 varsh purv hua tha
 Recent research by Gerata Keller, a professor of geomorphology at Princeton University, revealed the fact that the K-T boundary — a special geographical identity that reveals the k – t annihilation — occurred more than 300,000 years ago
 Had happened
 is prakaar chikasulab prabhaav ko dianasor ke vinaash se nahin joda ja saktaa
 They say that the eruption of volcanoes is the main reason for the destruction of dinosaurs and thus they do not accept Chatterjee's claim
 pataa chalaa dianasoron ke vinaash kaa karanchatarji jinhone oregon, portlend jiyological sosayadi of america kii haal main hui vaarshik baithak main apni samgr pariklpana pesh kii, tark ke saath kehete hai, jab dakshin main lava bah rahaa tha, tab bhi bharat main dianasor fal-phool rahe the
 In India, we found the bones of dinosaurs and their eggs safe in the sedimentary layer between the flows of the southern lava
 is prakaar yah ho saktaa he ki dakshin main hue pradooshan sambandhi prabhaav ke kaaran paryaavaran kaa sankat hua ho lekin vah dianasoron ke vinaash kaa mukhya kaaran nahin ho saktaa
 Indirectly, southern volcanoes may have been responsible for the intensification of the oceans, which destroyed the food of sea creatures
 lekin dianasoron ke vinaash ke liye shiva kaa prabhaav hi sabase nikatatam kaaran prathit hota he
 The research of Shiva Gahrshiva Gahvara, which was formed after the collision, gives scientists hope that they will be able to know more about the important events related to the life of the Earth and the history of this planet
 yadi yah gahvar vinaashkari takaraav kaa nateeja tha to isse yah baat sulajhane main madad mil sakati he ki ke-tii haadase main itani naslon kaa vinaash kyon hua
 And this may also shed light on the mineral composition of the K-T boundary period associated with geographical history

 They consider this information to be very important in determining the geometric reconstruction and age of the Shiva Gahvara, which is a drop-shaped structure in the depths of the sea and has an area of about 600 times 400 km
 lekin shiva se pehle sabase bada gahvar dakshin africa main veredfort kaa tha jiskaa gheraa 300 kimi he

 It is difficult to imagine such a deluge
 yadi unki manyata sahi he to takaraav ke maukey par bane shiva ke prabhaav ne prithvi kii papadi ko bhaap main badal diya or bhayanak garm padaarth ke alaava prithvi par kuch bhi nahin choda
 It seems that due to this effect, on the other side of the western coast of India, a part of the 30 miles thick granite surface was destroyed
 ho saktaa he ki is takaraav ne hi bhayanak mahadweep lava pravaah, jaise dakshini gart or sambandhit jwalamukheey visphot jo pashchimi bharat ke bade hisse ko aachhadit karte hai, shuru kiye hon
 This resulted in huge amounts of lava flow in the western part of India in a very short time
 hua jwalamukhi ke visphoton kaa janmaitana hi nahin, iske prabhaav se seychelles dweep bhartiya bhoomi se tut gaya or khiskkar africa kii ore chalaa gaya
 Chatterjee explains, the influence of Siva made the west coast of India geologically active
 chatarji aage bataate hai, va shiva prakshepastra lagbhag 25 mile tak failaa tha
 As soon as a meteorite of this size collides, it will form a huge cavity
 pahaad bhaap main badal jaaenge or dhul or malba vayumandal main chaa jayega jo suraj ko dhak legaa
 There will be rain from the skies of the red-heated mountains, which will cause terrible fires and intense rain in the forests around the world, which will destroy the hard-to-see creatures of the sea and cause terrible destruction of the food chain
 kuch vaigyanikon ne aisi kalpana bhi kii he ki dakshini jwalamukhiyon se nikali jahrili gaisen dianasoron ke vinaash kaa mukhya kaaran baniin
 Chatterjee explains, "there are many reasons to think in this direction that this effect gave rise to volcanic eruptions
 ''bana prithvi kii ek nai sataha kaa dhanchipane vyapak shodh or sanyog kii kaal gananaa karke chatarji ne apni manyata ko uchit pariprekshya main rakhaa he

 The result of the collision of the cavity construction: The working group of Chatterjee hopes that they will be able to conclude the results by examining the rocks extracted from the bottom of this cavity, to prove that the formation of this ocean cavity was the result of that terrible collision
 chatarji bataate hai, ''gahvar ke tal se hasil chattani tukade tuuti or pighali hui chattaanon par pade prabhaav ke lakshanik chinh saamne laa paaenge
 And we want to see if sharp rocks, minerals and metallic anomalies exist? Iridium is rich in astroids, and such anomalies are thought to identify the effects of collisions

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday claimed to have increased the well-being of the people in the last seven months since the prohibition of liquor in the state, saying two, three and four wheelers during this period in 2016 as compared to April to November of 2015
 Vehicle sales have increased

 Nitish reiterated that milk sales have increased by 11 percent in the state since the prohibition and sales of sweets like Rasgulla, Peda and Gulab Jamun have increased by more than 15 percent
