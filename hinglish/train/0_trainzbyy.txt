i cannot stop food subsidies
 main desh ke amiron ke liye kaam nahin kar rahaa hum
 Where did we have the option? You want us to make fertilizer five times more expensive, eliminate food subsidies
 main chahta hum ki unhen yah sabsidi milti rahe kyonki yah unka adhikaar he or desh ko unki bhalaai kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 i do not want the fiscal deficit like the Congress government 6

 It was more important for us to give relief to the weak and middle class

 Actor Zayed Khan is working hard these days to make a comeback to Bollywood, and is struggling day and night to promote his new film 'sharafat Gaya Tel Leen'

 Zayed is playing the role of a boy from Delhi in 'sharafat Gaya Tel Leen', which required the tone of the boys and boys in Delhi to know the tone and tone of the conversation, so to make the character as real as possible
 Traveled to many areas of Delhi and spent a lot of time with the youth there
 jaayed ne kaha, "mere dost gurmeet singh, jo is film ke nirdeshak bhi hai, mujhe dilli ke kai ilaakon main le gaye

 Drink tea with them, and try to learn their ways and ways of talking
 
 
 " Apparently, 'sharafat Gayi Tel Pane' is very important for Zayed Khan's career, because even today he is remembered for his role as Shah Rukh Khan's younger brother in one of his old films 'main Hoon Na'
 He did several films after 'main Hoon Na', but could not succeed, and gradually Zayed moved away from the big screen

 Some unknown miscreants in Jaipur district of Rajasthan uprooted an ATM machine on the outskirts of the city

 But when he could not open the machine, he uprooted it and took it along
 jabaki atm kaa guard chat par sota rahaa
 The incident took place in the Jobner police station area of jaipur on Tuesday morning
 bhensva ilaake menstate bank aaf india kaa atiemalga he
 Unknown miscreants arrived here on Tuesday morning
 pehle unhone mashin ko kholane kii koshish kii
 But when the machine did not open, they uprooted the machine itself
 bank adhikariyon ke mutabik bhensva main lage isetm main 26
 76 lakhs were loaded
 bhensva thanadhikari babulal ne bataaya ki atm kii suraksha ke liye tainaat surakshakarmi chat par so rahaa tha
 He informed the police about not seeing the ATM when sleep broke
 bank kii ore se agyaat luteron ke khilaaf maamla darj karavaaya gaya he or police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 input language kanika dhillon kii filmon ko surkhiyon main bane rahanaa aata he
 Manmargiyaan (2018) was accused of hurting the sentiments of Sikhs
 kedarnath (2018) par 'lav jihad' ko badhaava dene ke aarope lage
 The controversy started when the poster of Mantle Hai Kya, which was released in July, had just arrived
 usamen kangana ranut or rajkumaar raav aamane-saamne apni jeebh par ek blade khadi kiye hue hai
 Twitter users got angry with him
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki yah tasviir logon ko uttejit karne ke liye he
 Screenwriters are not usually the target of the public, but Dhillon is also credited in that poster
 poster par apane naam se khush 34 varshiya dhillon kahati hai, ''ek samaaj ke rup main, hamaare paas 'maansik rup se swasth' or 'saamaanya' kii bahut sakht paribhaashaayen hai
 i think the story of Mantle Hai Kya tries to portray people who do not fit these grooves
 '' ve puuchhati hai, ''ham bina unhen jaj kiye kis tarah dekhte hai?''dhillon 'ajeeb' or 'pagal' jaise label ko khaarij karti hai, lekin film kii tagaline uske agle bhaag main chhipi hui he, ''maansik santulan ko jarurat se zyada tarjeeh di jaati he
 "as a screenwriter," says Dhillon, "I have the right to tell an entertaining story without thinking negatively about anything, but there are obstacles in the mainstream
" main aapako ek commercial hindi film main pareshaani kaa vistrut upachaar to nahin bataa sakati par itnaa to kar hi sakati hum ki log maansik swasthya ko lekar baaten shuru karen
 And it is already happening
 ''dhillon apane dil kii baat udel dene main vishwaas rakhti hai
 She was depressed and traumatized after losing her father in 2014
 ''maine do saal tak iskaa saamana kiya
 Wanted to write this in some light-hearted manner
 '' ve jor dekar kahati hai ki mental he kya dusron ko apane andar chal rahi uthal-puthal auron ke saath saajha karne ko protsaahit kar sakati he
 Dhillon draws inspiration from contemporary things
 ve maanati hai ki kisi kahanikar ke liye yah sabase achche samay main se he or sabase kharaab daur bhi hote hai, ''yah sambhavat: hamaari digital pahunch ke kaaran he, lekin ek charam or dakshinpanthi ravaiya he jo zyaadaatar chizon ko vikrut karata he
 It is not a healthy tradition for creative expression
 ''dhillon ko ummid he ki ve apni filmon ke saath un chizon ke bare main baat karengi jinke bare main shaayad hi kabhi baat kii jaati he
 For example, in Manmargiya, Rumi (taspi Pannu) is caught thinking about her illicit lover while standing in a gurudwara
 dhillon kahati hai, ''mujhase poocha gaya ki ek pavitra sthaan par khadi mahila apane premi ke bare main kaise soch sakati he?main un logon se puuchhati hum ki kisi ke man main kab kis cheez kaa khyaal aa jaae, use kaise roka ja saktaa he? yah mere liye pitrusattatmak soch kaa pratik he
 i do not regret it or believe that whatever i wrote should not have been there
 ''netflix original kii apni agali film gilti main dhillon isi baat par charchaa karengi ki shame kii baat kya he
 Instead of focusing on the rapist or her victim, the show adopts a third woman's point of view
 dhillon ke man main maansik swasthya or shuchita ko lekar ek-sa tiraskaar he
 "if my story could make even a person feel uncomfortable, then i think i succeeded
" ''*** Senior BJP leader LK Advani termed the reports of no concrete evidence found by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed by the Supreme Court against Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in the post-godhra riots case
 modi kaa purajor tareeke se bachaav karte hue adwani ne kaha ki unke 60 varsh ke raajnneetik jivan main vah apane aise kisi bhi sahyogi ko nahin jaanate jinke khilaaf virodhiyon ne itnaa lagaataar or dweshpurn abhiyaan chalaaya ho jitna modi ke khilaaf chalaaya gaya he
 The former Deputy Prime Minister wrote in his blog that people who were part of the campaign that called Modi evil, attacked him on the basis of the same allegation that he could not stop the riots in Gujarat after Godhraqand
 unhone kaha ki kaaphi lambey vakt baad unhone yah kaaphi sukundaayak khabar padhi ki vishesh jaanch dal ne modi ko godhracand ke baad jaanboojhkar dange hone dene ke aaropon se mukt kar diya he
 Advani said that the country is eagerly awaiting the full details of the report submitted to the Supreme Court of SIT
 media kii ek khabar ke anusaar, esaiti ne modi ko is aarope se mukt kar diya he ki vah sampradayik dangon ko turant rokane ke liye dakhal dene ke apane sanvaidhanik kartavya ke nirvahan main naakaam rahe

 madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne congress ke varisht netaa evam purv mukhyamantri arjuna singh ke is daawey ko ‘sach se pare’ bataaya ki tatkaaleen union karbaide adhyaksh warren anderson ko dilli chhodane ke liye rajkeey vimaan unki jaankaree ke bina gaya tha
 Reacting to the statement made by Arjun Singh in the Rajya Sabha on the Bhopal gas tragedy, Chief Minister Chauhan said at his official residence, "the state aircraft cannot go anywhere without the consent of the Chief Minister
" singh (jo us samay mukhyamantri the) kaa is bare main kiya gaya daawa sach nahin he’’
 He said that he himself had seen the then 'log book', which was recorded on 15 December 1984 at 15:15
 ‘special flite orored by chif ministar’
 In this context, Singh's statement in the Rajya Sabha raises doubts, in which he has said that the state plane had gone to Delhi with Anderson without his knowledge
 unase baar-baar yah poochne par ki kya arjuna singh jhooth bol rahe hai, chouhan ne kaha ki ‘vah sach nahin bol rahe hai’
 The facts about this are being hidden
 The Chief Minister said that Arjun Singh broke the silence on this subject after a long time and he (chauhan) was confident that the truth would be revealed, but regret has not happened
 sawaal yah bhi he ki singh itani der se kyon bole
 The truth comes out in a moment, for so long was it being decided what to say
 kise fansaana he or kise bachaana he
 The Chief Minister said that Singh's claim was also 'not a hug' that the Central Home Department was under pressure to release Anderson after his arrest
 vah us samay keval madhyapradesh ke hi mukhyamantri nahin the, balki congress ke ek varisht or behad kootneetijna netaa the
 If he was pressured by the Home Ministry to release Anderson, he could talk to the Prime Minister or the Home Minister
 chouhan ne kaha ki singh kaa yah kahana bhi ascharyajanak he ki chunavi daure par aae tatkaaleen pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ko pradesh ke harda main jab unhone anderson kii giraftaar evam samooche ghatnakram kii jaankaree di, to unhone kaha ki ‘chaliye, agali sabha main chalate hai’unhone kaha ki swa
 Rajiv Gandhi could not be so zero in on such an event, in which fifteen thousand people lost their lives and millions were affected
 chouhan ne kaha ki jab singh ko anderson kii giraftaar par garv he, to uski rihaai par shame bhi aana chahie
 This is not his personal matter, the question is of thousands killed and more than five lakh people affected
 unhone kaha ki gas peediton ke liye yah ‘nyaay’ kii baat hogi ki arjuna singh sach saamne laaen
 He reiterated that Singh had tried to hide the facts and save someone
 ullekhneey he ki bhopal gas traasadee ke aapraadhik prakaran main yahaan tatkaaleen mukhya nyaayik dandadhikari mohan pi
 On June 7 this year, eight accused, including the then chairman of Union Carbide India Limited, Keshav Mahendra, were sentenced to two years imprisonment and a fine of Rs one lakh by Tiwari
 iske kuch dinon baad bhopal ke tatkaaleen colector moti singh ne ek bayaan dekar rahasyodghatan kiya tha ki jamaanat par rihaai ke baad anderson ko rajkeey vimaan se dilli bheja gaya tha
 The then Chief Minister Arjun Singh was silent on this matter, although he said that he would keep his word when the appropriate time comes

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah is arriving here on Tuesday for a two-day visit to feed the lotus in the politics of West Bengal
 shah apane daure ke pehle din bangladesh kii seemaa se lage malda jile main ek vishaal jansabha ke jariye 2019 loksabhaa chunaav kaa aagaaj karenge
 Malda district is considered a stronghold of Congress
 yah congress ke divangat netaa gani khan choudhary kaa ilaaka rahaa he, jahaan left se lekar mamata banerjee tak kaa jaadu nahin chal sakaa he
 In such a question, will Shah be able to feed the lotus in the politics of Malda? Gani Khan Chaudhary has been elected from Malda region from 1980 to 2005 and reached Lok Sabha
 2005 main choudhary ke nidhan ke baad se unka parivaar yahaan kii siyasat par kabiz he
 Malda district has two Lok Sabha seats
 inamen ek uttar malda seat, jahaan se gani khan choudhary kii bhatiji mausam nur congress se saansad hai or duusari, dakshin malda seat se unke bhai abu hasemkhan choudhary congress se saansad hai
 However, the 2009 Lok Sabha election has caused a rift between his brothers and niece
 2015 main unke bhaaiyon main se ek ne party chhod di or tiemasi main shaamil ho gaye
 The BJP could not make a foothold in Malda despite lakhs of efforts by senior leaders like Pramod Dasgupta to Biman Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharya during the 32-year Left government in the bjp's watch over Malda
 isi tarah se mukhyamantri mamata banerjee 2011 se satta main hai, lekin malda kii siyasat main tiemasi ko jagah nahin mil saki he
 Malda district of West Bengal is bordering Bangladesh, where tribal and Hindu voters have a significant number of voters
 aise main bijepi ko is ilaake main ummid kii kiran najar aa rahi he
 This is the reason why Amit Shah has chosen Malda to start Mission Bengal
 rashtriya swayan sevak sangh (aresas) pashchim bengal main hindutv kii jami ko majboot karne main juty hui he
 There is a steady growth in the Sangh branches in the state
 saal 2013 main yahaan sangh kii 750 shakhaaen thim jo 2018 main badhkar 1279 ho gayi
 In this way, there are about 37 branches of the Sangh in Malda, which have 4,000 active members and more than 25,000 supporters
 mana jaataa he ki pashchim bengal ke kisi or ilaake se zyada bijepi ke prati logon ko jhukaav isi kshetra main he
 Here in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP got 17 percent votes
 60 fisadi muslim matadaataaon vaali malda dakshin seat par 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi duusare number par rahi thi
 Not only this, in the Panchayat elections held last year, BJP had won the victory of more than 500 seats in Malda district
 seat ke siyaasi samikaransaal 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaav main malda jile kii 12 siton main se mamata banerjee kii party ek bhi seat nahin jeet saki thi
 Ghani Khan's brother Naser Khan was defeated and defeated by his nephew Isha Khan Choudhary as CPM candidate
 lekin wo baad main tiemasi main shaamil ho gaye
 Of the 12 seats in Malda, 9 seats were won by Congress, 2 seats by CPM and one by BJP
 narendra modi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav bengal kii raily main bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon ko waapas bhejne kii baat kahi thi
 Now after the NRC draft comes, the issue of illegal Bangladeshis has started to arise in Assam as well as Bengal
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah is mudde ko jor-shor se uthaa rahe hai
 The BJP has been steadily accusing Mamata Banerjee of expanding its base in the region by accusing it of Muslim appeasement
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko malda kii donon loksabhaa siton par behatar nattejey kii ummid najar aa rahi he
 It is about the year 1893
 england main pard kar lautaa 24 salka ek vakil mumbai main apane pair jamaane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 He met a merchant of diamonds and pearls, who was deeply knowledgeable of Indian spirituality
 donon kii gadhi chhanane lagi
 Then, after two years, the lawyer moved to South Africa
 kai saal tak donon ke bich patrachaar hota rahaa
 Later this merchant became the spiritual master of that lawyer
 unhone us vakil ko dharm or aadhyatm ko samajhane kii drushti di, uske kamajori ke palon main mitrataa ke saath use satya or ahimsa ke maarg par chalane kii himmat di
 The same lawyer emerged as the hero of our freedom fight as Mahatma Gandhi
 ve vyapaaree the rajchandra mehta
 The story of these two is credited with being threaded in a play called Yugpurush to the Srimad Rajchandra Mission in Dharampur, Gujarat
 naatak kai shaharon main kai bhashaaon ke manchan se hota hua haal hi main desh kii rajdhani dilli pahunchaa
 It pretends to show a wonderful personality, and that too for the new generation, who lack such references
 lekin oonche logon ko darshana aasaan nahin hota
 There was a lack of balance and taste in staging and writing
 mutthi baandh kar vande maataram ke aakraamak naare lagaate hue gandhiji katai nahin jamate
 Srimad Rajchandra always has a similar smile on his face, as seen on the faces of today's market babas

 The Home Ministry's decree on SPG security will now be with the people on foreign tour
 jinhen bhi ye suraksha praapt he ab unke saath videshi dauron par bhi SPG ke jawan tainaat rahenge, yani koi bhi vyakti jise ye suvidha praapt he uske saath jawan bhi videsh kaa daura karenge
 Earlier this did not happen, but now the government is changing the rules
 sarkaar ke is faisle ko congress ke purv adhyaksh rahul gandhi or gandhi parivaar ke anya sadasyon ke dauron se joda ja rahaa he
 Let us tell you that SPG protection is given to the Prime Minister and former Prime Ministers in the country
 abhi ye suvidha pradhanmantri narendra modi ke alaava gandhi parivaar ko milti he
 These include Congress President (interim) Sonia Gandhi, former President Rahul Gandhi and General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
 pehle ye suraksha purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko bhi di jaati thi, lekin haal hi main unki suraksha main sirf Z+ cover kar diya gaya
 Questions have been raised about Rahul! Please tell that before the Maharashtra elections, Rahul Gandhi has gone on a foreign tour, there are discussions that he has gone to Bangkok or Cambodia, but his official location is not known
 bhartiya janata party kii ore se kai baar is par sawaal uthaae ja chuke hai ki rahul gandhi aksar aisi videshi yatraaon par jate hai,jisaki desh ko jaankaree nahin hoti he
 While he is the elder leader of the opposition party
 iske pehle bhi rahul gandhi kai baar 50 din kii chuttee yaa aise dauron par gaye hue hai, jinpar bijepi nishaanaa sadhti rahi he
 What did Rahul Gandhi do in SPG security till now? In fact, whenever a person went on a foreign tour on behalf of the Gandhi family, he used to take the security of SPG till his first stoppages, but after that he would send them back
 gandhi parivaar kii ore se is dauraan privesi kaa hawala diya jaataa tha or apni yatra ko aage badhaayaa jaataa he
 What will happen now? According to the new changes of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, if any member of SPG security is on foreign tour, then SPG jawans will always be with them
 agar aisa nahin hota he to jaan kaa khatra bana rah saktaa he
 That is, till going abroad from Delhi and coming back to Delhi, SPG security personnel will stay with Gandhi family
 pradhanmantri to hameshaa hi is suraksha ghere ke bich main rahete hi hai
 How does the Prime Minister get SPG protection? SPG security? Let us know that apart from four-tier security, the Special Protection Group (SPG) is a special security system under which the present and former Prime Ministers of the country and their close relatives are given this protection

 Exit Poll trends that preceded the Lok Sabha Elections 2019 results have caused a stir in the politics of Madhya Pradesh (madhya Pradesh)
 nirdaleey or duusare dalon ke sahyog se chal rahi kamalnath sarkaar kii kamjor kadi talashne ke makasad se bhaajapa ne vidhansabha kaa satr bulaane kii maang kar daali he

 The results of the Lok Sabha elections are yet to come, but there is enthusiasm in the BJP due to exit poll trends
 agsit pole rajya main congress ko ek se chah siten milane kaa anumaan jataa rahe hai
 Due to this, on Monday, Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargava wrote a letter to the Governor and demanded a special session of the Assembly
 unhone patr main likhaa he, "vidhansabha kaa gathan hue or nai sarkaar ke prabhaav main aae lagbhag chah maah vyateet ho chukaa he
 During this time many problems of urgent and immediate importance have arisen in the state

 dilli main agar narendra modi ke netritv main sarkaar aati he to basapa, sapa or nirdaleey vidhayak bhaajapa kaa saath de sakate hai
 Due to this, the BJP has played a stake in calling the session
 vahiin bhaajapa kii ranneeti ko dhyaan main rakhkar congress kii ore se vidhayakon main yah sandesh diya ja rahaa he ki jald hi mantrimandal kaa vistaar ho saktaa he

 They have tried this many times
 bahumat siddh karne ke liye sarkaar puri tarah taiyaar he, hame koi samasya nahin he
 They are trying to harass the present government to protect themselves
 "satr bulaae jane ko lekar likhe gaye bhargav ke patr par congress ke varisht netaa or purv kendriya mantri suresh pachori ne kaha, "netaa pratipaksh ne lok mahatv ke vishyon par charchaa ke liye satr bulaane rajyapal ko patr likhaa he

 Independent mlas have openly expressed their displeasure several times
 aise main centre main bhaajapa sarkaar kii vaapasi se rajya ikai ko lagata he ki congress kii kamjor kadi ko vidhansabha satr ke dauraan khojna aasaan hoga
 According to the source, these disgruntled mlas will be satisfied by extending the cabinet in the coming days from the Congress

 Congress leader and former minister Subhash Kumar Sojatia says, "the BJP is cooking khyali casserole
 agsit pole ko hi nattejey maan baithi he
 But on May 23, the bjp's land will slip
 jahaan tak rajya sarkaar kaa sawaal he to vah paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa karegi
 "after the exit polls of news media, only former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan gained importance among the state leaders," says Girija Shankar, a political analyst
 netaa pratipaksh or party adhyaksh kaa kahin zikr nahin aayaa
 The letter written to call the assembly session is just a means of making headlines in the media

 mukhyamantri ne maovadiyon se italvi nagarikon ko reeha karne kii apil kii thi
 The lives of couple 2006 and 2007 graduates Rasika Agashe (36 years) and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub (36 years), respectively, from the National School of Drama (NSD) are like an anecdote
 balki kahen ki choti-choti uplabdhiyon se pare jaakar manch ke liye kisson kii talash kaa thodaa alag jivan
 Zeeshan went to Dubai for a job in an acting school with a diploma but returned to Delhi in two and a half months after seeing all the conditions there
 yahi theatre karte hue charchit film no van kild jesica (2011) ke liye unhen mauka mila
 After that both moved to Mumbai
 saamaajik-rajnatik muddon par unka chaukannaapan manch ke liye unhen lagaataar kuch nayaa talashne ko prerit kar rahaa tha
 Doing cinema and drama just for entertainment was never his motive
 or tabhi disambar 2012 main dilli ke charchit nirbhaya cond ne unako pahal kaa bada mauka de diya
 He took an initiative in this direction in 2013 by creating a theater group called Being Association
 jishaan kehete bhi hai, ''ham mumbai actor banane nahin balki apni pasand kaa kaam karne ke liye aae the or vahi kar rahe hai
 His Bisek films also include Zero, Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, Tanu Weds Manu and the recent article 15, in which he has lived a character inspired by Dalit activist Chandrashekhar Ravan
 donon kii mul phikr chunki theatre ke aasapaas thi, so jishaan ne cinema se kuch paise kamaaye or rasika ne usee boote par naatakon par dhyaan jamaaya
 In the absence of fresh imagery plays focused on contemporary issues and concerns, he took another initiative in the form of a competition for a new theatrical play: Samhita Manch
 ve kahati hai, ''ek nayaa naatak karne ke liye hamen pasandida script nahin mil rahi thi
 Thinking that we kept the competition to get 4-5 scripts
 or dekhie! 80 script milin
 It made sense that people are writing
 '' gaiyr-sarkari str par nae naatak likhavane or phir chuninda script kaa manchan karwaane kii yah durlabh pahal he
 This was the third year of the competition and under this, around 300 scripts have come so far
 rasika bebaaki se bataati hai ki naatakon ko padhuya or unamem se chhaantnaa itnaa dhairya kaa or chunauteepurn hota he, iskaa unhen bilkul bhi andaja na tha
 One of the four plays selected this year, Radheya (dramatist: Amit Sharma), based on the life of Karna, was directed by Rasika herself
 jishaan iske produsar bane
 His shows took place in 4 cities including Mumbai and Delhi
 pichley chah saal main unke group ke kiye bisek naatakon main se 11 kii script isi tarah nikalakar ai
 They do theater for their own comfort but they know that due to this, no one can walk home
 jishaan maanate hai ki ''theatre main itane paise milte to main cinema main jaataa hi nahin
 "rasika speaks the front line," i start to sweat when the cost of staging a play increases
 tab jishaan kaa yah kahana badi takat detaa he ki 'tu phikar mat kar, bas naatak sambhaal
 "and when people like drama, both of them take a breather thinking that" Put money at the right place
 ''beeing association ab nae-puraane hindi naatakon kii i-librari bana rahaa he, jisase ki ve natya sansthaaon ko manchan ke liye nishulk yaa kuch roylty ke saath uplabdh hon
 Some playwrights like Asghar Wajahat have given their creations free of charge
 diggaj natyakarmi habib tanwir ke kuch aprakashit naatak bhi mili hai
 30 plays have also been uploaded
 donon ke liye yah apane kaam ko 'enjoy' karne kaa daur he
 Rasika clarifies, "by thinking more about the future, we will stop enjoying our work now
" '' isi soch ke tahat jishaan hansal mehta kii ek film kii shooting main vyast ho gaye hai or rasika gandhi par ek naatak kii taiyaari main

 But now i feel that things have changed and auditions are happening properly

 bjp's Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy has made a very serious charge against Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 swami ne daawa kiya ki sonia 2011-12 ke dauraan hindu aatankwaad kii dharna paidaa kar desh main apatkaal ghoshit karnaa chaahati thim

 ’ unhone kaha, ‘sabhi tikaten club, board, isisi ke jariye aakhirkaar janata tak hi pahunchati hai

 Police claim that the terrorists were involved in an attack at the dockyard of the Pakistani Navy in September and have been arrested from Napier's Haji Camp
 unke paas se 10 kilo visphotak, do raiflein, teen pistaulen or kuch kaartoos milane kii bhi baat kahi gai he
 Police said that they are all Muslims
 police kaa kahana he ki inamen se kaari shahid osman hi is giroh ke karachi kendra kaa sargana he
 In Pakistan, the leader of this clash is Asim Omar

 bhartiya gendbaaji main dhar kii kami ko lekar aalochanaayen hoti rahi hai, lekin had to tab ho gai, jab duniya kii nauven number kii team ne bhi world champion gendbaajon ke paseene chhudaa die
 Looking at the Indian bowlers during the Bangladesh batting, it was necessary to think about their condition against Sri Lanka and Pakistan
 isse pehle sirf aath van-de khelkar apane speed ke liye naam kama chuke varun aron ko 21 saal ke anamul haq boundry kaa safar karavaate rahe
 Varun Aaron's neither speed work nor his beamer
 captain mushafikur rahim ke khilaaf unke bimar ke baad unke khilaaf karrwai bhi ho sakati he
 Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar believes that after his act, he should be banned for two matches
 in sabake baad yah sochna jaruri ho gaya ki bhartiya gendbaaji main ab bhi sudhaar kii bahut gunjaaish he
 India's first match in the Asia Cup was such that a team like Bangladesh crossed the 200 mark in the 39th over itself
 kamjor bhartiya gendbaaji kaa phayda uthaate hue sava sau vanade khel chuke bangladesh ke captain ne apane kariyar kaa doosraa vanade shatak jamaaya
 This was the second time that both captains played a century in an ODI match
 varun ne kareeb 10 ran prati over kii ausat se (7
 5−0−74−1−9
 44) ran kharche, to bharat ke number 1 spinner aar aswin ne 10 over main 50 ran kharch daale or sirf ek wicket chatka sake
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar also gave away runs at an average of 5 runs per over, losing 41 runs in 8 overs and could manage a single wicket
 mohammad shami ne bangladesh par ankush jarur lagaaya, lekin aakhri 10 overon main bangladesh ne 71 ran jode or bharat ko 280 ran kaa chunauteepurn lakshya diya
 It is clear that the condition of Indian bowlers is poor
 asia cap ke apane pehle hi match main agar bangladesh ke aage bhi painaapan nahin he, to pakistan or srilanka ke aage halaat kaise honge yah jarur gaur karne laayak baat he

 At batting, Kieron Pollard and Corey Anderson will have to stay on the wicket
 ambati raidu ab tak mili maukey kaa phayda nahin uthaa paae hai
 Although the Mumbai bowlers have not impressed much during the first three matches so far, but a big relief for the team is that bowling will be led by Lasith Malinga, Pragyan Ojha and Harbhajan Singh and these three bowlers Who have been a success against Chennai Super Kings
 vahiin duusari ore chennai super kings kii team apane donon match jeet chuki he

 Where in Jatpura village, a man named Jai Singh used to work as a broom

 Even after the marriage of the young woman, Jai Singh and Sumangala's relationship did not break
 sumangla shaadi ke baad bhi aksar beemaari kaa bahaanaa karke tantric jai singh ko apane ghar bulaati thi
 Such illegitimate relations continued to flourish
 ek din uske pati ramprasad ke saamne ye raaj khul gaya
 Ramprasad opposed this
 lekin jaisingh or sumangla nahin maane
 One day Ramprasad attacked Jai Singh and threatened him to end this relationship, but everything went on like that

 He resorted to an unknown woman for this task
 usne jai singh ko bataaya ki ek mahila kaa ilaaj karnaa he

 is vaardaat ke baad 3 sitambar ko jai singh kaa shav kosi nadi ke kinare jangal se baraamad kiya gaya tha
 After this, Amar Singh, the brother of the deceased Tantrik Jai Singh, had filed a murder case against Ramprasad and three other people, but in the case of lack of evidence twice, FR was imposed in the case
 is dauraan hatyaropee ram prasad aksar hatya kii baat kahkar jai singh ke bhai amar singh ko hatotsahit karata rahaa
 Ultimately, the court wrote to the Superintendent of Police to investigate the murder once again despite the FR being applied on Amar Singh's application
 vivechna ke dauraan police ke haath ek aisa gavaah laga, jisane jai singh ko hatya se pehle ram prasad or anya teen logon ke saath kosi nadi ke kinare jhaad phoonk ke liye murga le jate hue dekha tha
 The witness also interrupted him
 jis par ram prasad ne kaha tha ki log puja bhi nahin karne dete
 SP Sanjeev Tyagi said that Sumangala had also been under suspicious circumstances six months after Jaisingh's murder
 tab se lekar ab tak yah maamla adaalat main vichaaradhin he
 Police have taken Ramprasad into custody after 15 years
 uske khilaaf paryaapt subut bhi ikattha kiye gaye hai
 Police is searching for the remaining accused

 Now, along the lines of the increase in the prices of diesel and petrol, the National Highway Authority has also caught the way
 usne desh bhar ke toll tex nako main tamaam vaahanon kii awajahi par toll tex badha diya he
 That too up to five rupees
 jabaki zyaadaatar neshnal hive bade bade gaddho main tabdeel ho gaye hai
 They do not understand the road or the pit
 hive kii marammat bhi samay par nahin hoti
 Despite this, the National Highway Authority has issued a notification for awarding toll contractors in the name of revising toll tax
 15 oktober se desh ke tamaam toll tex nako main sabhi prakaar ke vaahanon par shulk kii badhottaree lagu kar di gayi he
 Interestingly, keeping in mind the Chillar problem, the charges were to be reduced in several highways in the round figure
 lekin use bhi badha diya gaya
 There is not a single highway in the country where vehicles are given relief in tax payment due to toll tax revision
 chhattisgarh ke sabase bade durg bypass express- ve ke naake par badha hua shulk lagu bhi kar diya gaya he
 There are seven toll blocks here
 har vaahan ko toll fis ke rup main 3 se 5 rupee tak zyada dene pad rahe hai
 Durg bypass is a toll barrier where bike riders are charged Rs 13 for every round
 ise badha kar ab 15 rupee kar diya gaya he
 For example, if the present toll has been increased to Rs 157, then it has been increased to Rs 160
 agar shalk 51 rupaya he, kaayade se ise 50 rupee kiya janaa chahie tha, lekin yah 55 rupee kiya gaya he
 According to experts, the toll collection company has increased the fees in most cases
 jabaki enechai afasaron kaa daawa he ki rate is tarah se riviz karnaa he ki ise kahin kam bhi kiya jaye
 The National Highway has authorized companies operating toll naco that they can charge up to 10 times the fees from overloaded vehicles
 is nirdesh ke baad chhattisgarh hi nahin desh baaki toll nako main bhi vaahanon kaa vajan karne mashine lagaai jane lagi hai
 According to experts, the National Highway Authority has taken this decision keeping an order of the Bilaspur High Court in the center
 gauratlab he sadak banaakar toll vasuulne vaali companiyon ne nyaayalay main yachika daayar kii thi ki overlod vaahanon se sadaken jaldi karaab ho rahi hai
 And the cost of their repair is also increasing
 choti karansi kaa avamulyan hone kii vajah bataa kar desh bhar main naishanal hive athurity ne toll tex riviz kiye hai
 Under the new rule, all toll tolls in the country will be charged by the new revise system by the year 2030
 haalanki iskaa virodh bhi shuru ho gaya he
 Passengers are calling it excess
 unke mutabik neshnal hive pehle apni sadaken thik kare, suvidhaayen de phir toll tex riviz kare
 You will be surprised to know that in the capital of Delhi alone where ten thousand cases of cybercrime are happening in a day, the Central Government has stopped the cyber tribunal set up for cybercrime
 dukhad ye bhi he ki pichley saat saal se chairman ke naa hone se is tribunel main 2011 se ek bhi maamle kii sunwaayee nahin ho saki
 In this era of information technology where cybercrime is steadily growing and everyone of you and us who use smart mobiles is an easy victim, the government has scrapped the Cyber appellate Tribunal in 2006
 is tribunel main 2011 se chairman naa hone se sibar krime se jude ek bhi maamle kii sunwaayee nahin ho saki thi
 That is, if you suddenly lose millions of rupees from a bank account or someone has stolen your personal information from a computer, or someone has hacked your computer, then you will not be able to do anything to get their hearing and to punish the offender
 aapke paas haath malane ke alaava koi or vikalp nahin he
 Cyber expert Pawan Duggal explains that only the case registers in the Crime Bureau's crime records that register firs and the total number of crime cases which are perpetrated are completely opposite to current reality
 hamane kuch saal pehle ek survey kiya tha ki bharat main kis tarah se under reporting hoti he, sibar krime ke maamalon main hamane paaya ki 500 main se 50 kii hi shikaayat milti he or phir 50 main se 1 cese kii hi exiaar darj ho paati he
 At present, the government has merged the Cyber tribunal and the Airport Tribunal into the TD set ie Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal, but it is only a ritual payment because TD Set already has one and a half thousand cases pending and only to hear the cases
 There is a bench
 bench main na koi sibar export he or na koi judishal bench kaa judishal member, lihaaja yahaan koi sibar krime se judi yachika hi nahin lagaataa, kyonki bina duusari bench ke banesibar frodse jude maamalon kii sunwaayee sambhav hi nahin he
 Retired Justice Shiva Kirti Singh from Supreme Court is the chairman of TD set
 wo khud bhi maanate hai ki pehle se hi itane maamle pending hai lihaaja jab tak nai bench nahin banati, sibar ho yaa airport tribunel, maamalon kaa jald nipataara nahin ho saktaa
 Therefore, he has also written to the government that another new bench should be set up in the tribunal
 tidi set ke chairman justise shiva kirti singh kehete hai ki yahaan pehle se hi bahut zyada maamle pending hai, lihaaja nai bench banane kii jarurat he or isko lekar hamane sarkaar ko likh diya he
 At present, TD Set does not even have its own office
 ise dilli ke paanch sitara samraat hotel se chalaaya ja rahaa he, jiskaa salanaa kiraaya hi sarkaar kareeb 10 karod rupee dene pad rahe hai
 In the audit for many years, the question has been raised as to why the Tribunal is being run from the hotel
 tribunel main karodon kharch karne vaali sarkaar aaj bhi sibar krime ke shikaar logon ko apana cese darj karaane kaa vikalp nahin de paa rahi he or ye haal tab he jab pradhanmantri narendra modi bharat ko digital india main tabdeel karnaa chaahate hai

 The government has taken several steps taking cognizance of the problems
 magar ham pehle apni series ke bare main baat karenge jo pichley teen dinon se vishvavidhyalayon main shikshakon ke khaali pad ko lekar chalaa rahe hai
 After all, how are our universities running, what are the students studying when there are no professor lecturers there? chaatro or shikshakon kaa samooh bhi lakhon kaa he, phir bhi is samooh ne paryaapt dabaav kyon nahin banaaya ki class main teacher nahin hai
 If made, why did the government not listen? aapaki ankhon ke saamne ucch shiksha khatm hoti rahi, aapane bardaasht kaise kiya

 This university was established on 1 October 1917
 is saal or is maheene sau saal kaa ho gaya
 The Prime Minister is going to Patna on 14 October
 hamaara sawaal simpal he
 Has the Prime Minister been told how the present of Patna University is in addition to history
 kya unhen maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne bataaya he ki vahaan kai collejon ke department main ek hi professor he or kisi kisi main ek bhi nahin he
 If Prakash Javadekar is busy, has the Minister of State for Human Resource Upendra Kushwaha, who was a student of this university, given information? Has Chief Minister Nitish Kumar informed the Prime Minister that there are no teachers there, there is a building which has become hundred years old, we are celebrating the same? pradhanmantri aa rahe hai isliye patna uniwarsity ko jhaad jhankhaad ko ukhaad kar deevaaron ko ranga ja rahaa he
 Well, where the Prime Minister is being cleaned here, there is hardly a chance to look at the Prime Minister, but the official way of throwing dust in the eyes neither leaves the public nor spares his head
 unke aagaman ke baad kuch dinon tak nagarikon ko bhi yaad rahegaa ki vaah kya kaarykram hua, aane par uniwarsity ko chamakaa diya gaya
 Prime Minister, all this is not done in your honor, you don't know the realities, that's why it is being done

 But this Oxford of Bihar died

 Its condition is similar to Patna University
 patna vishvavidlaay ganga ke kinare banaaya gaya he
 There will be very few universities in the world which will be built on the banks of the river, from whose class the Ganges used to flow
 bean college ke kamaron kaa naam river vyuu room hua karata tha, science college ke kuch lacture theatre ke mukaable aaj bhi kisi uniwarsity ke paas nahin hoga
 We all used to go to Science College to see how HC Verma, a great professor of physics, takes classes
 unke class kaa jaadu hota he
 Gradually Patna University turned into ruins, and no one tried to add a new brick
 chemistry or maths ke professor puure shahar or rajya main hero kii tarah puuje jate the
 The dream of Bihar was Patna University, the dream which everyone killed together
 oxford kahalaane kaa man to bharat kii kai uniwarsity ko tha, magar koi uske meyar ko chhu na saki
 Our universities have been beautiful to watch
 patna uniwarsity vaaki khubasurat he
 But what is its role today, is it because its centenary year is being celebrated so that the Prime Minister has to be called? We do not know how he is the vice chancellor of Patna University, what he has done for this university, but from the record that appears, it seems that its condition is very bad

 But most of all Patna University has been memorable because of its teachers
 yahaan ke itihaaskaaron ne itihaas lekhan or padhaane kii disha badal di
 Professor Lalji Prasad's books were so popular among mathematics masters
 jis uniwarsity main kai class main padhaane ke liye shikshak na ho, shikshakon kii kami ke kaaran kuch course band kar die gaye hon, kya us vishvavidlaay ko bharat jaise garib desh or bihar jaise garib rajya ko shatabdi varsh manaane ke naam par ek rupaya bhi kharch karnaa chahie? unke swaagat par pachaas lakh-karod rupaya to karch hoga hi, yahi nahin desh ke pradhanmantri kaa ek ek second keemtee hota he, aakhir patna uniwarsity unke saamne apni kya report pesh karegi
 Why are we celebrating the centenary year of Patna University? patna uniwarsity ke juolji department ke vibhaag adhyaksh bi ke mishra hai
 Once there used to be 24 to 26 professors, but now it is running on the strength of only 4 teachers
 kabhi patna uniwarsity juolji vibhaag kii bharat or duniya main dhooma hua karti thi
 The department of GO Chemistry was quite popular but now no professor teaching this subject has been closed
 ek professor ko kai kai paper padhaane padate hai
 Research work has come to a standstill due to not being a professor
 2003 ke baad bahaali nahin hui thi, kuch padon kaa vigyaapan to niklaa he magar bahut kam or wo bhi bahaali kii raftaar kaaphi dhimi he
 In a blue shirt, PK Sinha has retired from the Geological Survey of India, which is read at his expense

 There are many departments in many colleges of Patna University which are running on the trust of each one of the professors
 1980 ke dashak se hi patna uniwarsity kii haalat karaab hone lagi
 Casteism and hooliganism ruined it and then this university was never managed
 pichley pandrah saal main bhi iskaa uddhaar nahin hua
 During this period, lakhs of students from Bihar were forced to come to Delhi and study
 unke maa baap ne zamin bechakar or mehnat kii puunji lagaakar unhen padhaayaa
 There was emotional and financial loss
 yahaan ke patna science college main padhanaa sabakaa sapana hota tha, bihar ke top chaatr padhate the, ab jo top karata he wo science college nahin dilli uniwarsity aata he
 You have also read the information we have collected about the Science College

 There are 112 posts approved in Patna Science College
 magar yah college maatr 28 profasaron ke bharose chal rahaa he
 There are only 2 teachers in Biology 2, Mathematics 3 and Banaspati Science
 angrezi main 1 or hindi main do hi shikshak hai
 After all, why are we not able to run at least two Universities in a State
 kisi bhi rajya kaa haal dekhie, bataane laayak nahin he
 Are the posts kept vacant so that no one gets a job even after doing phd
 in khaali padon kii sankhya dekhakar lagata he ki na jane kitne naujavaanon ke shikshak banane ke sapane ko kuchlaa gaya he
 Ten years, teachers ruined their lives by teaching Adhak, but were not filled even after posting
 agar bharna nahin he to phir piechdi kyon ho rahi he, ujisi net kaa imtahaan kiske liye letaa he
 Patna Law College has 14 teacher posts but 9 posts are vacant

 There are 34 posts in the Hindi department but only 11 professors are teaching
 patna college main dhai hazaar chaatr hai or padhaane ke liye maatr 30 shikshak hai
 In Patna College's Hindi Department, only 2 are teaching instead of 6

 The Prime Minister is about to visit, so whoever we talked to, nobody came on camera in anticipation of any action

 There is a small question, how are you able to see all this
 tippaniyan a little information and
 sitamarhi kaa ek college he es el ke college
 Five thousand students study, teacher is only 5
 ek teacher hazaar chaatr ko padhaa rahaa hoga vahaan
 If you are from Bihar, then put your hands on your heart and say that you would like to leave Delhi University and get your child admitted to Patna University, knowing that there are no teachers there
 kai baar to lagata he ki pradhanmantri ko shatabdi varsh main jane kaa apana iraadaa hi badal dena chahie
 Our effort was that this information should reach the Prime Minister or else in his speech only the glory will be there, not present
 ve galat jaankaree ke shikaar ho jaaenge
 He should talk about empty class rooms, empty teachers in his speech
 mukhyamantri or up mukhyamantri se poochna chahie ki patna uniwarsity kii aisi haalat kyon he wo bhi tab jab donon vahiin ke chaatr hai, or unke karyaalay se ek ghante kii duuri par he
 By the way, the Prime Minister should also take a round of Patna, he will know how bad the cleanliness condition in the city is

 This university was established on 1 October 1917

 The Prime Minister is going to Patna on 14 October
 hamaara sawaal simpal he
 Has the Prime Minister been told how the present of Patna University is in addition to history
 kya unhen maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne bataaya he ki vahaan kai collejon ke department main ek hi professor he or kisi kisi main ek bhi nahin he
 If Prakash Javadekar is busy, has the Minister of State for Human Resource Upendra Kushwaha, who was a student of this university, given information? Has Chief Minister Nitish Kumar informed the Prime Minister that there are no teachers there, there is a building which has become hundred years old, we are celebrating the same? pradhanmantri aa rahe hai isliye patna uniwarsity ko jhaad jhankhaad ko ukhaad kar deevaaron ko ranga ja rahaa he
 Well, where the Prime Minister is being cleaned here, there is hardly a chance to look at the Prime Minister, but the official way of throwing dust in the eyes neither leaves the public nor spares his head
 unke aagaman ke baad kuch dinon tak nagarikon ko bhi yaad rahegaa ki vaah kya kaarykram hua, aane par uniwarsity ko chamakaa diya gaya
 Prime Minister, all this is not done in your honor, you don't know the realities, that's why it is being done

 It has been more than nine hundred years since the University of Oxford, continues to this day and students still dream of going there

 ham sab science college dekhne jate the ki physics ke mahaan professor ech si verma kaise class lete hai
 Their class has its magic
 dhire-dhire patna uniwarsity khandhar main badalata gaya, or kisi ne nai eent jodne kii koshish nahin kii
 Professors of chemistry and mathematics were worshiped like heroes throughout the city and state
 bihar kaa sapana tha patna uniwarsity jis sapane ko sabane milakar maar diya
 Many universities of India had the desire to be called Oxford, but no one could touch her Meyer
 hamaari uniwarsity dekhne main hi kuubasurat rah gai hai
 Patna University is really beautiful
 magar aaj isaki bhoomika kya he, kya isliye iskaa shatabdi varsh manaaya ja rahaa he taaki pradhanmantri ko bulaanaa he? ham nahin jaanate hai ki patna uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar kaise hai, unhone is uniwarsity ke liye kya kiya he, magar jo record dikh rahaa he usase yahi lagata he ki isaki haalat bahut buree he
 People who have passed from this university are famous all over the world today

 ganit ke mastaron main professor lalji prasad kii kitabon kii kitni dhooma hua karti thi
 a university that does not have a teacher to teach in many classes, some courses have been closed due to lack of teachers, does the university spend even a rupee in the name of celebrating the centenary year of a poor country like India and a poor state like Bihar should do? Fifty lakh-crore rupees will be spent on his reception, not only is it worth every second of the Prime Minister of the country, after all what Patna University will present to him
 ham kyon patna uniwarsity kaa shatabdi varsh manaa rahe hai? BK Mishra is the department chairman of the Juology Department of Patna University
 kabhi yahaan 24 se 26 professor hua karte the magar ab yah sirf 4 shikshakon ke dam par chal rahaa he
 Once Patna University used to be a part of the Department of Zoology in India and the world
 jio chemistry kaa vibhaag to kaaphi femes tha magar ab is vishay ko padhaane vaala koi professor hi nahin lihaaza band kar diya gaya he
 a professor has to teach many papers
 professor na hone ke kaaran research kaa kaam thapp ho gaya he
 Restoration was not done after 2003, some posts have been advertised but very few and that too is very slow
 neeli kameez main pi ke sinha jeeyololical survey of india se ritair hue hai, jo apane kharche par aakar padhaa jate hai
 Only such teachers should meet the Prime Minister coming for the centenary year
 jo uniwarsity khandhar ho chuki he, uske bheetar ye shikshak aatma kii tarah abhi bhi bache hue hai
 Prof
 BK Mishra said that in the sixties, when there were no ten thousand students in Patna University, then there were more than a thousand posts for teachers
 aaj jab yahaan ke chaatro kii sankhya bees hazaar ke kareeb pahunch gai he to shikshakon kii manzur padon kii sankhya bhi kam kar di gai he or usamen se bhi aadhe se zyaada khaali hai
 Teachers like Prof
 Mishra somehow take a class
 padhaa hi dete hai
 Some teachers say that considering the number of students in Patna University, there should be 2000 teachers, but 420 post khaali hai, 320 prophessoron ke dam par uniwarsity chal rahi he
 More posts are empty than what you are teaching
 is baar 150 padon kaa hi vigyaapan niklaa he, jo kaaphi nahin
 Even after the restoration of 150, 170 posts will remain vacant
 patna uniwarsity ke kai college main kai vibhaag aise hai jo ek ek profasaron ke bharose chal rahe hai
 The condition of Patna University started deteriorating from the 1980s

 It has not been saved even in the last fifteen years

 Everyone used to study in Patna Science College here, the top students of Bihar used to study, now the top who does it comes to Delhi University, not the Science College
 science college ke bare main hamane jo jaankaree jutai he, aap bhi padhie
 If Bihar could not save Patna Science College, then what is left with it

 a university that does not have a teacher to teach in many classes, some courses have been closed due to lack of teachers, does the university spend even a rupee in the name of celebrating the centenary year of a poor country like India and a poor state like Bihar should do? Fifty lakh-crore rupees will be spent on his reception, not only is it worth every second of the Prime Minister of the country, after all what Patna University will present to him
 ham kyon patna uniwarsity kaa shatabdi varsh manaa rahe hai? BK Mishra is the department chairman of the Juology Department of Patna University
 kabhi yahaan 24 se 26 professor hua karte the magar ab yah sirf 4 shikshakon ke dam par chal rahaa he
 Once Patna University used to be a part of the Department of Zoology in India and the world
 jio chemistry kaa vibhaag to kaaphi femes tha magar ab is vishay ko padhaane vaala koi professor hi nahin lihaaza band kar diya gaya he
 a professor has to teach many papers
 professor na hone ke kaaran research kaa kaam thapp ho gaya he
 Restoration was not done after 2003, some posts have been advertised but very few and that too is very slow

 Only such teachers should meet the Prime Minister coming for the centenary year
 jo uniwarsity khandhar ho chuki he, uske bheetar ye shikshak aatma kii tarah abhi bhi bache hue hai
 Prof
 BK Mishra said that in the sixties, when there were no ten thousand students in Patna University, then there were more than a thousand posts for teachers
 aaj jab yahaan ke chaatro kii sankhya bees hazaar ke kareeb pahunch gai he to shikshakon kii manzur padon kii sankhya bhi kam kar di gai he or usamen se bhi aadhe se zyaada khaali hai
 Teachers like Prof
 Mishra somehow take a class
 padhaa hi dete hai
 Some teachers say that considering the number of students in Patna University, there should be 2000 teachers, but 420 post khaali hai, 320 prophessoron ke dam par uniwarsity chal rahi he
 More posts are empty than what you are teaching
 is baar 150 padon kaa hi vigyaapan niklaa he, jo kaaphi nahin

 But what is its role today, is it because its centenary year is being celebrated so that the Prime Minister has to be called? We do not know how he is the vice chancellor of Patna University, what he has done for this university, but from the record that appears, it seems that its condition is very bad
 is uniwarsity se paas kiye log aaj duniya bhar main chhaae hue hai
 Rajiv Gauva, Home Secretary, Government of India has also been a student of Patna University
 inaki to dhooma hua karti thi padhai ke maamle main
 The Chief Secretary of Gujarat, Dr
 je en singh bhi patna uniwarsity ke chaatr rahe hai
 Girish Shankar, secretary of heavy industry, who retired a month ago, has also been a student of this place

 Former Railway Minister and former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Yadav has also been a student of this place
 iees, ipies, mukhyamantri se lekar kendriya mantri tak jitna man utana gin lijie, patna uniwarsity ne bahut kuch diya he
 But most of all Patna University has been memorable because of its teachers
 yahaan ke itihaaskaaron ne itihaas lekhan or padhaane kii disha badal di
 Professor Lalji Prasad's books were so popular among mathematics masters
 jis uniwarsity main kai class main padhaane ke liye shikshak na ho, shikshakon kii kami ke kaaran kuch course band kar die gaye hon, kya us vishvavidlaay ko bharat jaise garib desh or bihar jaise garib rajya ko shatabdi varsh manaane ke naam par ek rupaya bhi kharch karnaa chahie? unke swaagat par pachaas lakh-karod rupaya to karch hoga hi, yahi nahin desh ke pradhanmantri kaa ek ek second keemtee hota he, aakhir patna uniwarsity unke saamne apni kya report pesh karegi
 Why are we celebrating the centenary year of Patna University? patna uniwarsity ke juolji department ke vibhaag adhyaksh bi ke mishra hai
 Once there used to be 24 to 26 professors, but now it is running on the strength of only 4 teachers
 kabhi patna uniwarsity juolji vibhaag kii bharat or duniya main dhooma hua karti thi
 The department of GO Chemistry was quite popular but now no professor teaching this subject has been closed
 ek professor ko kai kai paper padhaane padate hai
 Research work has come to a standstill due to not being a professor
 2003 ke baad bahaali nahin hui thi, kuch padon kaa vigyaapan to niklaa he magar bahut kam or wo bhi bahaali kii raftaar kaaphi dhimi he
 In a blue shirt, PK Sinha has retired from the Geological Survey of India, which is read at his expense
 aise shikshakon ko hi shatabdi varsh ke liye aa rahe pradhanmantri se milaanaa chahie
 Within the university which has been ruined, these teachers still remain like a soul
 pro bi ke mishra ne andaaz se bataaya ki saath ke dashak main kabhi patna uniwarsity main jab das hazaar chaatr nahin hua karte the tab yahaan shikshakon ke liye hajaar se adhik pad manzur the
 Today when the number of students here has reached close to twenty thousand, the number of sanctioned posts of teachers has also been reduced and more than half of them are vacant
 pro mishra jaise shikshak kisi tarah class le lete hai
 They read it
 kuch shikshakon kaa kahana he ki patna uniwarsity main chaatro kii sankhya ko dekhte hue 2000 shikshak hone chahie, magar 420 posts are vacant, the university is running on the strength of 320 professors
 jitne padhaa rahe hai usase to zyaada post khaali hai
 This time only 150 posts have been advertised, which is not enough
 150 kii bahaali ke baad bhi 170 pad khaali hi rahenge
 There are many departments in many colleges of Patna University which are running on the trust of each one of the professors
 1980 ke dashak se hi patna uniwarsity kii haalat karaab hone lagi
 Casteism and hooliganism ruined it and then this university was never managed
 pichley pandrah saal main bhi iskaa uddhaar nahin hua
 During this period, lakhs of students from Bihar were forced to come to Delhi and study
 unke maa baap ne zamin bechakar or mehnat kii puunji lagaakar unhen padhaayaa
 There was emotional and financial loss
 yahaan ke patna science college main padhanaa sabakaa sapana hota tha, bihar ke top chaatr padhate the, ab jo top karata he wo science college nahin dilli uniwarsity aata he
 You have also read the information we have collected about the Science College
 agar bihar patna science college nahin bachaa sakaa, to uske paas bachaa hi kya he
 There are 112 posts approved in Patna Science College
 magar yah college maatr 28 profasaron ke bharose chal rahaa he
 There are only 2 teachers in Biology 2, Mathematics 3 and Banaspati Science
 angrezi main 1 or hindi main do hi shikshak hai
 After all, why are we not able to run at least two Universities in a State
 kisi bhi rajya kaa haal dekhie, bataane laayak nahin he
 Are the posts kept vacant so that no one gets a job even after doing phd
 in khaali padon kii sankhya dekhakar lagata he ki na jane kitne naujavaanon ke shikshak banane ke sapane ko kuchlaa gaya he
 Ten years, teachers ruined their lives by teaching Adhak, but were not filled even after posting
 agar bharna nahin he to phir piechdi kyon ho rahi he, ujisi net kaa imtahaan kiske liye letaa he
 Patna Law College has 14 teacher posts but 9 posts are vacant
 patna lau kalege sirf 5 prophessoron ke dam par chal rahaa he
 There are 34 posts in the Hindi department but only 11 professors are teaching
 patna college main dhai hazaar chaatr hai or padhaane ke liye maatr 30 shikshak hai
 In Patna College's Hindi Department, only 2 are teaching instead of 6
 yahaan ke itihaas vibhaag main 6 kii jagah ek hi professor padhaa rahe hai
 The history of Patna University's history department is even worse
 das saal pehle yahaan 25 professor hua karte the, ab sirf 6 hai
 This is why the fleet of history is going on
 log classroom kii jagah whatsap uniwarsity main itihaas kii padhai pard rahe hai
 Magadh Mahila College once had 100 professors, today there are 32 professors
 magadh mahila college main paanch hazaar ladkiyaan padhati hai
 Can 32 professors teach 5000 students? There is a professor to teach in Hindi, history and biology
 in teenon vibhaag main kam se kam paanch paanch professor hone chahie the
 You might be wondering what i mean by reading the blank figure
 hamane bhi kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki patna uniwarsity kii ye haalat hogi
 There was also a time that the students here used to do three years of BA in six years, the train used to be late, but here the session was late
 ganimat he ki seshal let nahin he
 The Prime Minister is about to visit, so whoever we talked to, nobody came on camera in anticipation of any action
 bihar ke chaatro ko pataa he, kisi tarah metric tak yahaan kaato phir dilli chalo
 You remember, for the last ten years, the stories of the success of studies in Bihar come from coaching institutes and not from the university
 agar bihar ke paas ek uniwarsity nahin he, duniya ko dikhaane or chaatro ke palaayan ko rokane ke liye to phir kya he
 There were many governments, but no one could set up a university
 14 oktober ko patna uniwarsity aakhir bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa saamana kaise karegaa yaa pradhanmantri kis tarah se uskaa saamana karenge? hamane desh ke kai vishvavidlaayon kaa haal janaa he
 It was understood that the money-makers had made arrangements to teach their children elsewhere
 jo garib or saadhaaran log hai unke bachche na pard paaen iskaa intazaam kar diya gaya he taaki ve pidiyon tak vahiin rahen jahaan unke purakhe the
 The big people did not mind that the condition of Patna University is bad because their children chose another university with the money, the common people were left to dream as empty class
 ek sawaal aapse he ki kya aap yah dekh paa rahe hai ki aapke bacchon kaa bhavishya jahaan bananaa he, vahaan kii haalat kya he
 There is a small question, how are you able to see all this
 tippaniyan a little information and
 sitamarhi kaa ek college he es el ke college
 Five thousand students study, teacher is only 5
 ek teacher hazaar chaatr ko padhaa rahaa hoga vahaan
 If you are from Bihar, then put your hands on your heart and say that you would like to leave Delhi University and get your child admitted to Patna University, knowing that there are no teachers there
 kai baar to lagata he ki pradhanmantri ko shatabdi varsh main jane kaa apana iraadaa hi badal dena chahie
 Our effort was that this information should reach the Prime Minister or else in his speech only the glory will be there, not present
 ve galat jaankaree ke shikaar ho jaaenge
 He should talk about empty class rooms, empty teachers in his speech
 mukhyamantri or up mukhyamantri se poochna chahie ki patna uniwarsity kii aisi haalat kyon he wo bhi tab jab donon vahiin ke chaatr hai, or unke karyaalay se ek ghante kii duuri par he
 By the way, the Prime Minister should also take a round of Patna, he will know how bad the cleanliness condition in the city is
 ve kisi gupt car main baithkar kisi bhi gali main chale jaaen, gandagi milegi
 Count as much as IAS, IPS, Chief Minister to Union Minister, Patna University has given a lot
 magar in sabase zyaada patna uniwarsity apane shikshakon ke kaaran yaadgaar rahaa he

 If Bihar does not have a university, what is there to show the world and stop the migration of students
 bahut si sarkarein raheen magar koi ek uniwarsity na khadaa kar saki
 How will Patna University face the Prime Minister of India on October 14 or how will the Prime Minister face it? We have known the condition of many universities of the country
 yahi samaj aayaa ki paise waalon ne apane bacchon ko padhaane kaa kahin or intazaam kar liya he
 Arrangements have been made to ensure that the children of poor and ordinary people are unable to read so that they will remain where their ancestors lived for generations
 bade logon ko fark nahin padaa ki patna uniwarsity kii haalat kharaab he kyonki unke bacchon ne paise se duusari uniwarsity chun lee, rah gaye aam log to unhen khaali class rup main sapana dekhne ke liye bitha diya gaya

 At times, it seems that the Prime Minister should change his intention to enter the centenary year

 They will fall prey to misinformation
 unhen apane bhaashan main khaali class room, khaali shikshakon kii baat kerani chahie
 The Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister should ask why the condition of Patna University is such that even when both are students there, and is an hour away from their office

 They sit in a secret car and go to any street, dirt will be found
 jis uniwarsity main kai class main padhaane ke liye shikshak na ho, shikshakon kii kami ke kaaran kuch course band kar die gaye hon, kya us vishvavidlaay ko bharat jaise garib desh or bihar jaise garib rajya ko shatabdi varsh manaane ke naam par ek rupaya bhi kharch karnaa chahie? unke swaagat par pachaas lakh-karod rupaya to karch hoga hi, yahi nahin desh ke pradhanmantri kaa ek ek second keemtee hota he, aakhir patna uniwarsity unke saamne apni kya report pesh karegi
 Why are we celebrating the centenary year of Patna University? patna uniwarsity ke juolji department ke vibhaag adhyaksh bi ke mishra hai
 Once there used to be 24 to 26 professors, but now it is running on the strength of only 4 teachers
 kabhi patna uniwarsity juolji vibhaag kii bharat or duniya main dhooma hua karti thi
 The department of GO Chemistry was quite popular but now no professor teaching this subject has been closed

 BK Mishra is the department chairman of the Juology Department of Patna University
 kabhi yahaan 24 se 26 professor hua karte the magar ab yah sirf 4 shikshakon ke dam par chal rahaa he
 Once Patna University used to be a part of the Department of Zoology in India and the world
 jio chemistry kaa vibhaag to kaaphi femes tha magar ab is vishay ko padhaane vaala koi professor hi nahin lihaaza band kar diya gaya he
 a professor has to teach many papers
 professor na hone ke kaaran research kaa kaam thapp ho gaya he
 Restoration was not done after 2003, some posts have been advertised but very few and that too is very slow
 neeli kameez main pi ke sinha jeeyololical survey of india se ritair hue hai, jo apane kharche par aakar padhaa jate hai
 Only such teachers should meet the Prime Minister coming for the centenary year
 jo uniwarsity khandhar ho chuki he, uske bheetar ye shikshak aatma kii tarah abhi bhi bache hue hai
 Prof
 BK Mishra said that in the sixties, when there were no ten thousand students in Patna University, then there were more than a thousand posts for teachers
 aaj jab yahaan ke chaatro kii sankhya bees hazaar ke kareeb pahunch gai he to shikshakon kii manzur padon kii sankhya bhi kam kar di gai he or usamen se bhi aadhe se zyaada khaali hai
 Teachers like Prof
 Mishra somehow take a class
 padhaa hi dete hai
 Some teachers say that considering the number of students in Patna University, there should be 2000 teachers, but 420 post khaali hai, 320 prophessoron ke dam par uniwarsity chal rahi he
 More posts are empty than what you are teaching
 is baar 150 padon kaa hi vigyaapan niklaa he, jo kaaphi nahin
 Even after the restoration of 150, 170 posts will remain vacant
 patna uniwarsity ke kai college main kai vibhaag aise hai jo ek ek profasaron ke bharose chal rahe hai
 The condition of Patna University started deteriorating from the 1980s
 jatvaad or gundgardee ne ise barbaad kiya or phir yah uniwarsity kabhi sanbhal nahin saki
 It has not been saved even in the last fifteen years
 is dauraan bihar se lakhon kii sankhya main chaatr dilli aakar padhane ke liye majaboor hue
 His parents taught him by selling land and applying hard work capital

 Everyone used to study in Patna Science College here, the top students of Bihar used to study, now the top who does it comes to Delhi University, not the Science College
 science college ke bare main hamane jo jaankaree jutai he, aap bhi padhie
 If Bihar could not save Patna Science College, then what is left with it
 patna science college main 112 pad manzur hai
 But this college is running on the strength of only 28 professors
 jeev vigyaan 2, ganit main 3 or banaspati vigyaan main 6 hi shikshak hai
 There are only 1 teacher in English and two in Hindi
 aakhir ham ek rajya main kam se kam do hi uniwarsity dhang se kyon nahin chalaa pate hai
 Look at the state of any state, it is not worth mentioning
 kya padon ko isliye khaali rakhaa gaya taaki piechdi karne ke baad bhi kisi ko naukari na mili
 Seeing the number of these vacant posts, it seems that the dream of becoming a teacher of many youngsters has been crushed
 das das saal shikshakon ne edaha padhaakar apni jindagi tabah kar daali magar post hote hue bhi nahin bhare gaye
 If there is no filling then why is phd being done, for whom does UGC take the examination of NET
 patna lau college main 14 teacher ke pad hai magar 9 pad khaali hai
 Patna Law College is running on the strength of only 5 professors
 hindi vibhaag main 34 pad hai lekin 11 professor hi padhaa rahe hai

 GDP has continued to fall after demonetisation and GST
 haalanki sarkaar kah rahi he ki jidipi ke girane kaa notebandi se koi lenaa dena he
 It will not be right to associate it with demonetisation
 siesao ke anand kumaar ne kaha he ki jidipi main giravat aane kii mukhya vajah ye he ki sarvice sector ne acha parform kiya he, or menuphaccharing main giravat main ai he
 It is clear that due to demonetisation, manufacturing declined and GDP figures were hit
 jidipi ke girane ko in 4 point main samajhen -vitt varsh 2017-18 kii pehali timahi main jidipi dhadaamachaalu vitt varsh kii june main khatm hui timahi ke dauraan desh ke sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) kii vruddhi dar main giravat darj kii gai he
 GDP figures fall to 5
 7 fisad par aa gaya he
 This figure 6 in the fourth quarter of FY 2016-17
 1 fisadi tha
 This information came from official data on Thursday

 GDP was 1 per cent, according to figures released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), GDP 5 in the first quarter of the current financial year
 7 fisadi kii vruddhi dar ke saath 31

 GDP growth during the first quarter of FY 2016-17
7
 9 fisadi thi
 The figure of GDP in the year 2016-17 is 7, which is the big problem of demonetisation on manufacturing sector
 1 fisadi (chaaron timahi kaa jod) tha
 The steady decline in GDP is a matter of concern for the government, although the government says that demonetisation is not responsible for it, while the demand of one thousand and five hundred rupee notes went out of circulation and the effect of this was on the GDP
 Is visible in menuphaccharing sector par iskaa sabase zyada asar padaa he
 Sector growth rate 1 in June quarter

 Was 7 percent
 bataa den ki centre sarkaar ne puraane kar dhaanche ko khatm kar 1 july se jiesti lagu kiya he
