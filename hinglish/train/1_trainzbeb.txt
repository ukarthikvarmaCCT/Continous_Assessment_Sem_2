vahiin rojgaar kii kami or garibi se jujh rahe bengal main bijepi ne vaada kiya ki agar wo satta main ai to bengal main bhi enarasi lagu karegi or sabhi avaidh ghuspaithiyon ko desh se baahar karegi
 The people of West Bengal trusted this promise of the BJP and did not take any time to vote in favor of them
 mamata banerjee ne bengal main enarasi kaa sakht virodh kiya or kaha ki wo rajya main enarasi ko kabhi lagu nahin hone dengi
 The BJP accused Mamata Banerjee of her stand that she wanted to settle illegal Bangladeshi people in Kolkata and Bengal which would be a threat to the state and the country
 bijepi ko isse phayda mila or na sirf bengal main wo majboot hui balki ab mamata banerjee ko satta ke maamle main bhi takkar detii hui najar aa rahi he
 Banning Mamata from Hindu image, BJP accused Mamata Banerjee of favoring Hindus living in West Bengal in large numbers
 chaahe durga puja ho yaa phir phir saraswati puja
 The controversy over the prohibition of idol immersion and the exemption granted to Muharram was presented by the BJP as the biggest problem there and alleged that Mamata Banerjee was working for only a particular community
 ramanavami kii shobhaa yatra ho yaa phir pratimaa visarjan is mudde par mamata ke faisle or jidd ko bijepi ne hai court tak main chunauti di jahaan se mamata banerjee kii chhavi ko gaharaa dhakka pahunchaa
 The BJP was able to instill confidence among the majority Hindus of the place that TMC was behaving biased against them and wanted to give more leeway to a particular section
 2021 main hogi raajnneetik vajood kii ladaaimamata banerjee ke liye loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon main niraashaa ke baad ab 2021 kii ladaai sabase ahm he kyonki yah sidhe taur par unke raajnneetik vajood se judaa hoga
 The party leaders have become so confident about the fast growing BJP in West Bengal that they are saying that the countdown of Mamta government has started in Bengal
 bengal main bijepi ke rashtriya sachiv rahul sinha ne loksabhaa chunaav main party ke shandaar pradarshan ko lekar kaha nateezon ke 60 dinon baad hi mamata banerjee sarkaar badal jaaegi
 On the other hand, senior BJP leader and Bengal in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya said that the countdown of TMC has started
 pashchim bengal main 34 saalon se satta par jami sipiem sarkaar ko hataakar mamata ne saal 2011 main vidhansabha chunaav main 294 main se 184 siton par kabja kar rajya kii mukhyamantri baniin thi
 Now in 2021, Mamata will face a tough fight with BJP and saving this stronghold will be her most important fight
 mamata ke paas ab kya vikalpcentre main ek baar phir baari bahumat se endie sarkaar banane ke baad narendra modi or majubat honge jabaki rajya main mamata banerjee kii saakh giregi or unka modi virodh kamjor pad jayega
 After the election results are in favor of BJP, there will definitely be a conflict between the two parties and the incidents of political violence in the state may increase
 aise main mamata banerjee ke paas ek rasta yah ho saktaa he ki bhavishya kii raajnneeti main apana vajood banaae rakhane ke liye wo bijepi ke saamne hathiyaar daal den or vaajapeyi sarkaar kii tarah ek baar phir endie kaa hissaa ban jaaen
 Nitish Kumar has done so in Bihar and he also benefited in the Lok Sabha elections
 mamata banerjee ke paas doosraa rasta yah bhi ho saktaa he ki wo rajya main aane vaale dinon main congress se gathbandhan kar pashchim bengal main bijepi ke khilaaf apane tevar ko or kadaa kar puri takat se virodh main utar aaen or rajya se lagbhag khatm ho chuki sipiem party bhi apratyaksh taur par unka saath de

 Persecuted people reach for justice in the court of 'saheb', and find, so, we can also tell 'riyasat' a story inspired by 'godfather', or Amitabh Bachchan's film 'sarkar' Inspired by 'too
 
 
 vaise, ham jaanate hai ki pyaar se 'kaaka' kahkar pukaare jane vaale rajesh khanna kii aakhri film he 'riyasat', jiske puraa hone se pehle hi unka nidhan ho gaya tha
 
 
 Due to this the shooting of the film was not completed, and director Ashok Tyagi had to make the story a total of one and a half hours by manipulating the story
 
 
 'kaaka' film kii dabing bhi nahin kar paae the, isliye unke dialogs ko 'sik sound' kar is film ko mukammal tasviir di gai
 
 
 If 'kaka' could have completed the shooting of the film, and would have dubbed his dialogues himself, the fun of 'riyasat' would have increased, but who can avoid Honi

 Paying tribute to 'kaka', his last film has also been released on his second death anniversary, so it is not appropriate to tie 'riyasat' to numbers

 The use of SP-BSP alliance in this election is considered successful
 ab kai vishleshak voton ke bantwaare ke hisaab se yah anumaan laga rahe hai ki yadi 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main sapa-basapa mil gaye to endie ko upi main kam se kam 50 siton kaa nuksaan hoga or vah 23 siton ke aasapaas simat sakati he
 Interestingly, this estimate is being made on the basis of votes received by all parties in the 2017 UP Assembly elections, when the BJP won a landslide victory in the overwhelming Modi wave
 haalanki, aisa mana jaataa he ki vidhansabha chunaav or loksabhaa chunaav ke masale alag hote hai
 But the UP assembly elections were also contested by BJP on the face of Narendra Modi and his performance in the Lok Sabha will also be assessed
 indian express kii khabar ke anusaar, yadi sapa-basapa mili to loksabhaa main bijepi ko kam se kam 50 siton kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Based on these votes, it is estimated that the SP-BSP may get 57 seats in the state, while the bjp-led NDA will be reduced to only 23 seats
 gauratlab he ki saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa or basapa ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa tha or tab endie ko 80 main se 73 siton par vijay mili thi
 After this, when the two parties fought separately in the 2017 assembly elections, the BJP cleaned up the two
 403 sadasyon kii vidhansabha main sapa ko sirf 47 or basapa ko 19 siten milin
 sp's ally Congress had got only seven seats
 bijepi gathbandhan ko jabardast 325 siton par jeet mili thi
 But if the votes of 2017 are considered the basis, then the BJP is going to face a huge challenge in the Lok Sabha elections
 aisa hua to bijepi ko milengi 37 sitenhaalanki aankade agar 2014 ke loksabhaa ke mutabik rahe to sapa-basapa milane ke baad bhi mahaj 41 siten hi paaenge or bijepi ko 37 siton par jeet mil sakati he
 As per the 2017 data, SP-BSP got 1 average on all their 57 Lok Sabha seats
 45 lakh voton se jeet hogi
 The BJP can win 23 seats with an average lead of 58,000 votes
 bijepi ko sirf chaar siton varanasi, mathura, gajiabad or gautamabuddha nagar main 1 lakh ke zyada margin se jeet mil sakati he

 He said that the draft policy proposed that at least children up to class v and ideally up to class VIII should be taught in their mother tongue
 unhone kaha, "bachche apni maatrubhaasha main basic baton ko samaj pate hai
 English is also required to be learned, but after that foundation is strengthened

 in dinon rahul gandhi or gujarat main unke chunavi campan kii jamkar charchaa he
 From social media to the world of news, the attitude of Rahul is being discussed instead
 rahul gandhi gujarat chunaavon ke maddenjar apane teen charnon kaa chunavi campan puraa kar chuke hai
 During this, he addressed about half a dozen rallies in Gujarat
 gujarat main rahul gandhi ne apane tisare charan ke chunaav prachaar kii shuruyaat bharuch se kii thi
 Actually, Gandhi family has an old relationship with Bharuch
 awwal to vahaan rahul ke dada firoz gandhi kaa bachapan beetaa tha or unki daadi indira gandhi se shaadi ke baad kai baar bharuch bhi gaye
 Apart from this, there also comes a person from Bharuch who is helping Rahul Gandhi from behind the scenes who has pledged to move the BJP stronghold in Gujarat
 vah shaks koi or nahin balki ahamed patel hi hai jo 2001 se lagaataar rahul kii maa or maujuuda congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko raajnneetik salaah dete aae hai
 And it is also clear that no one in the Congress has an understanding of the politics of Gujarat more than Ahmed Patel, who is called Chanakya of Congress
 bijepi ke nishane par hai ahamed patechhamad patel gujarat vidhansabha chunaav jeetne ke liye rahul gandhi kii yojana ke pramukh ang hai
 There is also a discussion among Congressmen that if the Congress wins the Assembly elections, Ahmed Patel can become the Chief Ministerial candidate
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki bijepi ne do aies sandigdhon kii giraftaar ke baad ahamed patel ko sidhe nishaanaa banaaya he
 Earlier, BJP and Congress had used all their powers in the Rajya Sabha elections in Gujarat
 or congress ne kisi tarah lard-jhagadkar ahamed patel ko rajyasabha le jane main safalataa hasil kii thi
 Now, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has demanded Patel's resignation from the Rajya Sabha alleging that an IS suspect was working in a hospital run by Ahmed Patel's trust
 gandhi parivaar se purana he patel kaa rishtrahamad patel kii raajnneetik pari apatkaaleen dinon ke dauraan shuru hui jab log indira gandhi ke congress ko chhod rahe the
 He then hoisted the party flag in South Gujarat
 1977 main ve bharuch se loksabhaa ke liye chune gaye the, jab indira gandhi ne bhi raibareli main apni seat ganvaa di thi
 At that time Patel was only 28 years old
 ahamed patel gandhi parivaar main rajeev gandhi ke sabase kareebi rahe
 Rajiv Gandhi liked him a lot due to his punctual work
 rajeev gandhi ne congress main bade parivartan karne shuru kiye or yuvaaon ko mauka dena shuru kiya to ahamed patel ko bhi congress kaa mahasachiv banaaya
 After this, he came closer to not only Rajiv Gandhi but also to the Gandhi family
 gandhi parivaar se unki nikatataa 1991 main rajeev gandhi kii hatya ke baad or zyada ho gai
 Good strategistwhen P
 ve
 Narasimha Rao was Prime Minister, Ahmed Patel was only a caretaker in the Congress Working Committee
 jab 1990 ke ant main sonia gandhi ne congress kaa prabhaar sambhala, to ahamed patel phir se party ke ahm chehron main waapas aa gaye
 In 2001, Ahmed Patel became the political advisor to Sonia Gandhi
 congress kaa muslim cheharaa lekin muslim netaa nahizhamad patel congress ke liye ek muslim cheharaa to hai jo ehsaan jaafaree (jo gulburg sosayadi main 2002 main dangaiyon ke haath maare gaye the) ke baad sansad main gujarat kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 But he is not considered a Muslim leader as he has been in the Rajya Sabha since 1993
 or apni itani lambii raajnneetik pari main ve keval teen baar bharuch se saansad rahe (1977 se 1989 ke bich)
 Patel may not contest elections from Bharuch now, but he never broke his ties with Bharuch
 ho sakate hai siem candidetakai log maanate hai ki agar congress gujarat main amit shah or narendra modi ke rup main bijepi ke chunaav jeetne vaali mashin ko rokna chaahati he, to ahamed patel ko rajya ke mukhyamantri banane kii sabase acchhee sambhaavna he
 If this happens, it will speed up the preparations of the Congress as well as make the BJP think

 The Prime Ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Narendra Modi today mocked Congress President Sonia Gandhi's recent remarks of 'save God from Modi model', saying today that she will not take the name of God for 20-25 years
 Sonia is taking God's name again and again during the day
 isse pataa chalata he ki vah kitni badi musiibat main hai
 Modi, citing Sonia's remarks of 'god save', especially in public meetings held in support of BJP candidates in Sant Kabir Nagar, Basti and Gonda, said that the Congress President was repeatedly remembering God in his public meetings
 isse unki is chintaa kaa pataa lagata he ki ‘maa-bete’ kii sarkaar jane vaali he
 He said, 'congress wickets are falling one by one
 maine pichley 20-25 varshon main sonia ko kabhi bhagwaan ko yaad karte nahin suna
 You yourself can understand how much trouble he is in
 ' It is worth mentioning that at an election rally held in Barnala, Punjab on April 27, Sonia had advised the people to be smart with the divisive intentions of the BJP, that God should save the country from the Modi model
 modi ne kaha ki desh kii janata loksabhaa chunaav ke ab tak hue charnon main desh main majboot sarkaar kaa shilanyas kar chuki he
 He said, 'I keep thinking how to get employment, how to save the farmer, how to stop hooliganism
 
 
 pani kii samasya samet tamaam muddon kaa hal sochataa rahata hum, lekin vipakshi log sochate hai ki modi kaa hal kya he
 ' gujarat main kal yani 8 agast ko hone vaala rajyasabha chunaav congress or bhaajapa donon ke liye pratishtha kaa sawaal ban gaya he
 This is the reason why the shah-maat game between the two parties continues
 bijepi jahaan soobe kii teenon siton par jeet kaa paracham laharaana chaahati he, to congress sonia gandhi ke chanakya kahe jane vaale ahamed patel ko jitaane ke liye din raat ek kiye hue he
 This is the reason that these elections have become very interesting, which is being watched by the country as well as the state
 darasal kuch maheene baad hi gujarat vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai, isiilie congress or bhaajapa donon apni puri takat ke saath pradesh kii rajyasabha siton ko jeetna chaahati hai
 So that with this victory an electoral board can be laid in the state
 vaise yahaan bijepi se zyada congress kii pratishtha daanv par he
 Ahmad Patel, political secretary of Congress high command Sonia Gandhi, is in the fray
 lekin chunaav se thik pehle congress ke kai vidhayakon ne bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he, jiske baad congress ne bijepi par party vidhayakon ko daraa dhamkaakar todane kaa aarope lagaaya
 The party took its mlas to Bengaluru in Karnataka to save them from the BJP and returned to Gujarat today after nine days
 kaayam rah paaegaa ahamed patel kaa rutaba?congress pramukh sonia gandhi ke raajnneetik sachiv ahamed patel paanchavin baar rajyasabha pahunchane kii jaddojahad kar rahe hai
 Ahmed Patel's status in Congress is not hidden from anyone
 pichley do dashak se ve sonia gandhi ke aankh-kaan maane jate hai
 Ahmed Patel decides every wind of the Congress
 congress shasit rajyon main mukhyamantri kaa chayan ho, centre main mantri banane kii baat ho yaa phir rajyon main sanghathan ke ahm padon par niyukti, kaha jaataa he ki ahamed patel kii rajamandi ke bina aise ahm faisle nahin hoteyahi vajah he ki congress ab apane chanakya kii rajyasabha kursi bachaane ke liye halaakan or pareshaan he
 She wants Patel's victory in the Rajya Sabha elections at any cost, although her path has been a bit difficult, but party leaders are confident about Ahmed's victory
 pravaktaa randeep surajevaala kehete hai ki rajyasabha ke saath-saath vidhansabha main bhi congress kii vijay hogi
 Ahmed Patel will win the Rajya Sabha election with the consent of all political parties
 chanakya varsej chanakyavaise ye siyaasi ladaai sirf do siyaasi dalon ke bich nahin he, balki do raajnneetik chanakyon ke bich bhi he
 bjp's Chanakya Amit Shah's rivalry with Congress's Chanakya Ahmed Patel is old
 donon netaa gujarat kii siyaasi zami se nikle hai or apni-apni party ke sarvocch padon par virajman hai
 Thirty six figures since 2010 between Amit Shah and Ahmed Patel
 amit shah ko 2010 main soharabuddin ke farji encounter ke cese main jail janaa padaa tha
 For this, he blames the then central government of Congress
 kaha jaataa he ki ahamed patel ke ishaare par hi amit shah ke khilaaf karrwai hui thi
 Not only Amit Shah, but also Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Ahmad Patel's feud
 pradhanmantri modi ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha tha ki kisi jamaane main wo or ahamed patel achche dost hua karte the
 Had to come to each other's house
 modi ne kaha ki wo ahamed patel ko babu bhai ke naam se pukaarte the, lekin ab patel unka phone tak nahin uthaate
 Modi also called Patel Mian, later Modi clarified that he respectfully calls him Mian Sahab
 duusari ore ahamed patel ne modi ke bayaan ko khaarij karte hue kaha tha ki main modi se sirf ek baar 1980 main mila tha
 i met this in the knowledge of the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 2001 main modi ke gujarat ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad se maine unke saath ek cap chaay bhi nahin pi he
 Ahmed Patel said that if someone proves his friendship with Modi, he will retire from political life
 saath hi patel ne kaha ki modi kaa bijepi main hi koi dost nahin he to congress main kaise hoga
 How difficult is the road to Rajya Sabha: The number of Congress members in the 182-member Assembly of Gujarat is now 50
 rajyasabha chunaav main jeet ke liye 47 vidhayakon ke voton kii jarurat he
 The way Congress mlas have left the party in the past
 aise hi agar chaar or vidhayakon ne cross voting kii to ahamed patel kaa sansad pahunchnaa mushkil hoga
 However, it is a matter of relief that the Congress, the main opposition party in the Assembly, has the support of two NCP and one JDU MLA
 baavjood iske cross voting kaa khatra he
 This has happened in the recent presidential elections
 congress ke 57 vidhayak hone ke baavjood mira kumaar ke samarthan main sirf 49 vot pade the
 Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has also claimed that BJP will win all the three seats of the state and the defeat of Ahmed Patel is certain

 Kasab, in Mumbai's special TADA court, was overturned by his statement which he gave after his arrest
 kasaab ne kaha ki usne magistrate ke saamne jo kaha tha wo dabaav main diya gaya bayaan tha
 Kasab's lawyer had applied that his client is a minor, so his case should be tried in a children's court
 shuukravaar subah kasaab ke vakil abbaas kaazmi ne adaalat ke saamne arzi rakhi to sab chaunk pade
 The lawyer said that he himself has been told by Kasab that he is a minor
 jaj ne poocha ki kya kasaab ko uske janm kii tarikh yaad he to vakil ne kaha ki kasaab zaahil-ganvaar he lekin use itnaa maaloom he ki wo 17 saal se kam kaa he
 But Kasab's lawyer's arguments got winded up in front of the arguments of the government lawyer
 sarkari vakil ne kaha ki giraftaari ke vaqt kasaab ne magistrate ke saamne apni paidaaish 13 sitambar 1985 bataai he, arthur road jail ke entry register main bhi kasaab ne yahi tarikh likhi he
 Which shows that he is over 21 years old

 kabhi kapil dev ke vikalp ke rup main pesh kiye ja rahe olerounder irfan pathan ke liye tej gendbaaj aar vinayakumar kii chot vardaan sabit hui
 Pathan got a place in the last-minute squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and he has solved the problem of India's all-rounder to some extent at the moment by performing brilliantly with both bat and ball
 pathan ne srilanka ke khilaaf paanch ekadivasiy maichon main visham palon main acchhee ballebaaji kii
 Apart from this, he has also justified his selection by bowling tight
 baroda ke is olerounder ne chaar pariyon main teen baar naabad rahete hue 76 ran banaaye jabaki aath wicket bhi liye
 These include the five-wicket haul of 61 runs in the last match at Pallekal, which helped India win the match and the series 4–1
 dilachasp baat yah he ki pathan ko is shrinkhalaa ke liye pehle team main nahin chunaa gaya tha
 a few days before the tour of the Indian team, Vinay Kumar was injured and the selectors chose Pathan in his place
 yah is olerounder ke paas aakhri mauka tha kyonki lagbhag teen saal tak baahar rahane ke baad jab unhone vaapasi kii to vah chayankartaaon ko prabhavit nahin kar paye the
 Pathan's performance in Sri Lanka is important now because India's forward schedule is very busy and he will need an all-rounder at all times
 pathan kaa aakhri match main pradarshan kaaphi myne rakhata he kyonki pichley paanch saal main yah chauthaa avasar he jabaki kisi bhartiya gendbaaj ne van de match main paanch wicket liye
 Pathan is also satisfied with his performance
 unhone kaha, ‘khuda kaa shukr he ki is puri shrinkhalaa main maine acchhee gendbaaji kii or kuch upyogi ran bhi banaaye
 Pathan was selected in the team for the first time in 2004 as a fast bowler
 iske baad unhone bhartiya gendbaaji kaa jimmaa acchhee tarah sambhala
 In the meantime, he also impressed with his batting and in some Test matches, he was also introduced to the innings
 jab greg chapel coach the to unhone pathan ko ballebaaji par adhik dhyaan dene ke liye kaha
 Pathan always kept repeating that he was the first bowler and then batsman but after 2006 his bowling started to become ineffective due to which he had to struggle for a place in the playing XI
 pathan ne pichley saal disambar main vaapasi kii lekin iske baad nirantar ek jaisaa pradarshan nahin kar paye
 He scored 100 runs in eight matches and took 13 wickets before the Sri Lanka tour from December but he flopped badly in the Asia Cup played in Bangladesh after which he was dropped from the team
 ab vah phir se lay main aa gayi hai or yadi vah is pradarshan ko barkaraar rakhte hai to bharat ko olerounder kii samasya se nahin jujhna padegaa or captain mahendra singh dhoni ke paas adhik vikalp rahenge

 is ap ke jariye kathith taur par adarsh aachaar samhita todakar bijepi kaa prachaar kiya ja rahaa he, jisase matadaata gumraah ho rahe hai
 Therefore, Congress has demanded from the Election Commission that this app be banned
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki bijepi fasebuk or watsap sareekhe soshal media madhyamon par bhi dushprachaar vaale aise post jari kar rahi he, jinase congress kii chhavi matadaataaon ke bich kharaab ho rahi he
 The Election Commission should stop such propaganda on social media

 State Congress spokesperson alleged that through this game, efforts are being made to unfairly influence voters

 On 12 February in Uttar Pradesh, MP from Hyderabad (andhra Pradesh) Asaduddin Owaisi's party majlis-e-ittehad ul Muslimeen (MIM) held its first procession
 yah vahi party he, jo maharashtra ke haalia vidhansabha chunaav main do siten jitkar apni upasthiti darj kara chuki he
 Although Owaisi, identified with his provocative statements, was not himself present in this procession in the Muslim-dominated Paratawal on Paniara Road in Maharajganj, MIM MLA from Charminar, Hyderabad, Syed Ahmed Pasha Qadri and other leaders strongly tried to woo Muslims
 
 mujffarnagar dangon ke jakhmon ko kureda gaya or ovaisi ko ''islam kaa sher'' bataakar musalamaanon se emiem ke jhande tale ekajute hone kaa aahvaan kiya gaya
 The matter was not limited to Maharajganj only

 ve majahabi talim ke prasiddh centre ''daarul ulum nadwatul ulema'' aae
 With the mobilization of Muslims against the BJP in Delhi, the motive of Prime Minister Modi's air was probably to drag Sareshwala as his envoy to Lucknow
 unhone nadwa college ke pramukh or ol india muslim personal lau board ke adhyaksh moulana rabe hasani nadvi ke saath do ghante se zyada samay bitaayaa
 The meeting was also important because Maulana Nadvi's guarded personal law board covered issues such as rhetoric, proselytisation and "ghar wapsi" of Hindutva organizations at the annual general council meeting in Jaipur from 21 March
 sareshwala ne upi main modi kii chhavi ko vivaadaaspad muddon se pare dikhaane kii koshish kii
 Soon the talks of Muslim leaders with Narendra Modi will be the next step in this direction
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main upi bhale ek bhi muslim ummidavaar ko loksabhaa kii dahalij tak na pahunchaa paaya ho, lekin dilli ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad ban rahe maahaul ne pradesh main musalamaanon ke sarokaaron ko kuch saaf kiya he
 Between them, a party like MIM has knocked in the state

 This is the reason why Kushwaha has advised Nitish Kumar to break his party

 input: bhashaa The last few days of the ICC World Cup-2015 have been quite exciting, as many great performances have been seen from the teams of well-known and weak and novice
 main haal ke aise hi ek match se shuruyaat karnaa chahta hum
 In November last year, during a visit to London in connection with his book Playing It My Way, a journalist questioned me about the England team's prospects in the World Cup
 maine apane jawaab main saaf-saaf kaha tha ki main england ko semifinal main pahunchane vaali chaar tiimon main nahin ginata hum
 My answer was based on the performance of England till then
 maine notice kiya tha ki england kii team main kuch aise mukhya yaa kendriya khiladinnon kaa sanket nahin he, jo vishwa cap main team kii takat ban saken
 It is no surprise that England has not been able to make a place in the Super Eight teams of this tournament
 isaki tulana main agar aap kuch behtareen pradarshan karne vaali tiimon—bharat, newjiland, srilanka or dakshin africa-ko dekhen to paaenge ki in sabhi tiimon main koi na koi mukhya yaa kendriya khilaadi jarur rahen hai, jiske irdagird baaki khilaadi apana yogadan dekar team ke behtareen pradarshan main madad kar rahe hai
 It is also a great thing that Bangladesh has reached the quarter-finals and Ireland also remains in that race
 yah usee baat ko doharaata he jo main baar-baar kah chukaa hum ki ubhartee tiimon ko apane khel ke str ko uthaane ke liye or zyada maukey die jane chahie
 The manner in which the Ireland team has taken the iron against established teams and shown the ability to chase big goals
 apane pool main paanch jeet or 100 fisadi record ke saath bharat kii form bani hui he
 Our team's strength has been its batting and with the top order players being in form, we have managed to do well in every match
 bhartiya team ne virdohi tiimon ke khilaaf bada score khadaa kiya he or lakshyon kaa peechha bhi badi aasaani se kiya he
 But i have been more impressed by the aggressive bowling of the Indian team, especially with fast bowling
 hamaare gendbaajon ne jarurat ke samay bahut acha pradarshan kiya he or unhone lagaataar paanch maichon main sabhi virdohi tiimon ko jis tarah ol out kiya he, vah kaabile tarif he
 The funniest thing in the match played against Ireland was that the early bowlers had not got any success and gave enough runs
 lekin tabhi ravichandran asina kii aguai main phiraki gendbaajon ne irish team ke ballebaajon par ankush lagane kaa faisla kiya or unke chakke chhudaa die
 Ireland, who scored 86 runs without losing any wicket, collapsed like cards
 vah apane nirdhaarit over bhi nahin khel sakaa
 This was possible only because of the collective strength of our bowling, otherwise they were smashed in the early overs
 is gendbaaji hamale kaa mahatvapurn paksh yah he ki vah virdohi team par lagaataar dabaav banaae rakhti he or ballebaaj ko uski kamajori main fansaana chaahati he
 The fast bowlers' camp is also bowling at a speed of around 140 kmph
 unhen phiraki gendbaajon kaa bhi puraa sahyog mil rahaa he
 These spin bowlers are becoming a big force in themselves
 aam taur par bhartiya team jab safalataa hasil karti he to team ke khilaadi hi mukhya rup se aakarshan kaa paatr banate hai jabaki parade ke peeche rahakar ranneeti banane waalon ko zyada shrey nahin diya jaataa
 There was a lot of criticism about the selection of the team and many types of questions were raised on the team management as to why such and such players were chosen
 But after the team's good performance, all the mouths are closed and nothing is being said in praise of those who have introduced the principle of consistency and patience
 australia daure ke samay aalochanaayen jhel chuke dhoni is samay tarif ke paatr ban gaye hai
 But not a single word has been written in praise of the way he bowed his head, faced criticism, sacrificed his father's duties and led his players through difficult times
 pakistan-dakshin africa or australia-srilanka ke muqablon main kuch shandaar pradarshan dekhne ko mili
 The way the Pakistan team performed in retaliation, the South African team clearly appeared in a panic
 bhartiya or pakistani tiimon kaa pradarshan apane ravaie main ek-duusare se bilkul vipareet rahaa he

 kaarykram sanchaalak geetkaar prasoon joshi ke ek sawaal par modi ne vahaan darshak ddeergha main baithe logon se kaha ki aapako anabhav hota hoga ki aapke passport kii takat badi he yaa nahin
 He said in question that whether the attitude of people abroad to see the people of India has changed or not
 hindustan to vahi he, aap bhi the, duniya bhi thi, lekin aaj jo badlaav hua he vah hindustan ne karke dikhaaya he
 Not only because of a country of 125 crore or a big market, but because of its balanced policy
 jo sach he, vah danke kii chot par bolnaa, dhridhata ke saath us par chalane kii himmat hamane dikhaai he
 Modi said that for 70 years of independence, India's PM should not go to Israel, which was such pressure? The PM of India should have the courage to say with courage that i will also go to Israel and the day i have to go to Palestine

 Today, no one can raise this question after four years
 uskaa kaaran modi nahin he
 Modi has faith in the strength of 125 crore countrymen, reverence for India's history, culture and life
 unhone kaha ki ek samay tha jab maanviya aadhaar par charchaa hoti thi to pashchim ke deshon kii charchaa hoti thi
 When the evacuation of 5-6 thousand people in Yemen, many countries of the world prayed that if you take out your citizens, then also take out our people

 maine videshi media se kaha tha ki ham na to kisi se aankh jhukaakar baat karenge, na aankh uthaakar baat karenge, ham aankh milakar baat karenge
 Modi said that today India has brought the program of Solar Energy to worry about global warming

 India has taken important steps to provide information on black money at the G20 summit

 Rat meat is becoming popular in a weekly rural market in Assam's Baksa district
 masaalon kii gravi ke saath banaae jane vaale is vyanjan ko ravivaar kaa swaadisht vyanjan bataaya jaataa he
 Vendors say that this dish is a traditional dish of some tribes in the north-eastern region, which is sold for 200 rupees per kg, just like broiler chicken
 guwahati se 90 kilometre dur bharat-bhutan seemaa se lage kumarikta ke ravivaar bazaar main log kaaphi sankhya main apana pasandida chuuhe kaa maance kharidne ke liye aate hai
 Rat meat is more popular in the Sunday market than chicken and pork
 chuuhe bechney vaale ek vyakti ne kaha ki padosi nalbadi or barpeta jile maance kaa mukhya strot hai
 Local farmers imprison these mice in a bamboo-made rat at night during harvesting of crops
 ek chuuhe kaa vajan ek kilo se zyada hota he
 By catching mice, farmers also protect their crop from spoilage
 kisaanon kaa daawa he ki chuuhe pakadaney se haal ke dinon main unki fasal ko hone vaale nuksaan main kami ai he
 Explaining how to catch mice, a salesman said he was hunted at night when he came near his bill
 is dauraan vah bill ke najadik lagaae gaye chuhedaan main funs jate hai
 The sale of rat meat is often done by people from economically weaker communities, for them it is another source of income besides working in the tea garden

 This went on until the do-mulk doctrine parted their way
 kuch samanthaayen phir bhi bachi raheen
 One is called the Father of the Nation in independent India and the other is baba-e-kaum of newly formed Pakistan
 donon apane-apane mulkon ke ganatantr banane se pehle hi chal based
 At a time when their countries are entering their 66th year as independent countries, in this imaginary conversation both are looking at themselves in their heritage and their heritage in their life stories
 jinnah(naak par tike chashme se ghadi dekhte hue) mistar gandhi, aapse baat karnaa hameshaa vakt barbaad karne jaisaa hota he
 Gandhi: But this is not the case for me

 Gandhi: (watching upwards with the spinning wheel) i know
 jinnahyah ashishtataa he ki jab ham baat kar rahe hon tab bhi aap katai karte rahen
 Gandhi: Let me close
 jinnakhapaka yah to puraa aabhamandal he naa
 
 
 This work like saints
 
 
 yah sab mujhe kabhi bhi aakarshith nahin karata
 Really, it was a kind of hurdle in our conversation which was completely focused on politics
 gandhimaine to kabhi nahin kaha ki main sant hum
 Jinnah: Your disciples see you in this form
 gandhimujhe shishyon kii aavashyaktaa nahin
 Jinnah: Do you think i will believe it? Gandhi: i have been feeling the need of allies and i have also met
 kuch to bade hi kaabil the
 What do you think? Jinnah: My colleagues and i had only one common goal, common passion - Pakistan
 gandhimera lakshya sabhi bharatvasiyon ke liye swaraj praapt karnaa tha
 An even greater goal was to establish hindu-muslim unity
 jinnayaap saare hindustaniyon ke liye thode hi bolte the
 Gandhi: i leave it to you
 parantu bharat ko akhand rakhane kaa meraa lakshya yadi vifal rahaa to kya bharat ko baantne kii safalataa se aapako jeet jaisaa ehsaas hota he?jinnahapako is tarah se tanj nahin kasnaa chahie, mistar gandhi
 Gandhi: Probably both of us are unsuccessful people
 jinnayaap apane bare main hi aisa kah sakate hai mi
 Gandhi

 Jinnah: Your face is on Hindustani notes

 hamane to bharat ko bantate dekha
 
 
 Jinnah: We saw the birth of Pakistan
 gandhilekin ab vah khushhaal desh nahin lagata
 
 
 Jinnah: So is India happy? Gandhi: i thought, now i should ask the question

 (looking at the clock) This is what i was waiting for
 gandhimeri mrityu teen goliyaan lagane se nahin balki ek adad dil jalane se hui
 Jinnah: What is the question? Gandhi: He called me the father of the nation, but this is not the country i dreamed of
 jinnanjanab, aap sawaal puuchhie
 Gandhi: My friends were not ready to listen to me
 hitler kii taraf se chunauti ai tab tak ve sangharsh karke or aapke saath lagaataar jabaani yuddh karke thak chuke the
 Jinnah: Mr
 Gandhi, Question
 gandhimain akelaa tha, jabaki aap
 
 
 You were the founder of Pakistan, the head of the nation, the leader of its Constituent Assembly, the head of the Muslim League
 jinnanji haa
 Gandhi: Now my question is this
 
 
 aap jo kuch chaahate the aapako sab mila
 
 
 You got everything
 
 
 to kya aap khushi-khushi mare?jinnah(jeb se pipe nikaalte hue) bahut dard hua marate vakt
 Gandhi: Oops
 
 
 jinnah(pipe jeb main waapas rakhte hue) bau darad thayo
 
 
 Yes
 
 
 bau darad
 Gandhi: There were at least two similarities between us - we were speaking Gujarati and suffering in pain in the last days
 jinnacamera matlab shaareerik takalif se tha
 Gandhi: My pain was not physical
 haa, ekadam antim kshanon ko chhod den to
 The first bullet that came like lightning had shocked me in a way
 
 
 haa duusari se jarur chot mahasoos hui, lekin teesri kaa to mujhe kuch anubhav hi nahin hua
 
 
 But the pain i am talking about was in my heart
 
 
 kuch-kuch aisa hi, jaise ki mujhe kisi angeethee main daal diya gaya ho, hindustan kaa bantwaaraa or narsanhaar
 
 
 i died because of that pain
 (ek baar phir chuppi kaa daur)jinnathamujhe lag rahaa tha ki yah sab bade salike se hoga
 
 
 After this, there will be no Hindus or Muslims in Pakistan, only Pakistanis

 Both Hindus and Muslims were killed in equal numbers

 But what does it mean to think about all this now?

 And saw the slaughter of Muslims in Bihar
 
 
 bihar main maine logon se poocha, ''yah dekhakar aap jinda kaise rah sakate hai ki aapaki ankhon ke saamne hi ek budhi mahila ko kaat daalaa jaae
 How can you see him as just a Muslim? She was a mother

 com / gsqvtfbg73 maharashtra main sthaneey nikaay chunaav kaa prachaar ab samaapti kii ore hai
 In this election, both BJP and Shiv Sena were facing each other
 donon partiyon ab aae din ek duusare par hamalaa karti rahati hai
 In this sequence, intensifying the attack on BJP, Shiv Sena has called this former ally the party as 'cobra'
 shiv sena pramukh uddhav thakare ne bhaajapa ke bare main kaha, "hamaara gathbandhan pichley 25 saal se cobra ke saath tha, jo ki ab apana fan nikaal rahaa he
 i know how to crush it
 " The Shiv Sena chief was saying these things while addressing a rally last evening for the civic elections to be held in the state on 21 February
 unhone kaha ki sena puraani galati nahin doharaana chaahati thi
 He attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, accusing them of cheating the public by making false promises and assurances
 tippaniyan Uddhav had put the Fadnavis government on a 'notice period' in the initial phase of the election campaign and ruled out any post-election alliance with the BJP
 haalanki rajya main sarkaar ko apni party ke samarthan ke mudde par unhone thodi narmi baratate hue kaha ki party kaa samarthan is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki vah rajya main pareshaan kisaanon ke karj maafee kii maang ko puraa karti he yaa nahin
 The Shiv Sena is constantly in a mood to attack the BJP
 abhi haal main enditivi se ek saakshaatkaar main shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne madhyavadhi chunaav ke liye logon ko taiyaar rahane ko kaha tha
 He had said that we would consider withdrawing support after the BMC election
 biemasi par pichley 20 varshon se shivasena kaa raaj he
 BMC is to be elected on 21 February
 shiv sena pramukh rajya main 21 farvari ko hone vaale nikaay chunaav ke liye kal shaam ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue ye baaten kah rahe the
 He said that the army did not want to repeat the old mistake
 unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi or mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis par hamalaa karte hue aarope lagaaya ki inhone jhuthe vaade or aashwaasan dekar janata ke saath dhokhebaaji kii he
 The comments chunaav prachaar ke shurati daur main uddhav ne fadanvis sarkaar ko ‘notice period’ par rakhaa tha or bhaajapa ke saath chunaav ke baad kisi bhi tarah ke gathbandhan se inkaar kar diya tha
 However, on the issue of her party's support to the government in the state, she was a little soft on her saying that the party's support would depend on whether she met the debt waiver demand of troubled farmers in the state
 bijepi ko lekar shivasena lagaataar hamalaa karne ke mood main rahati he
 Recently, in an interview with NDTV, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray asked people to be ready for the mid-term elections
 unhone kaha tha ki ham biemasi chunaav ke baad samarthan vaapasi par vichaar karenge
 The BMC has been ruled by the Shiv Sena for the past 20 years
 biemasi kaa chunaav 21 farvari ko hona he

 The top leaders of the Congress and the Nationalist Congress, together with the 'sangharsh Yatra' started from Chandrapur, reached Kolhapur on Tuesday
 pashchim maharashtra kaa ek bada or pragatisheel shahar kahe jane vaale kolhapur main mangalvaar ko janata ko sambodhit karne ke pehle ajit pavaar ke dil kii baat jubaan par aa hi gai
 By the way, the purpose of the Sangharsh Yatra is to get the distressed farmers in Maharashtra out of their debt as soon as possible and that is why the government of Devendra Fadnavis, who had assured the farmers to be debt free during the elections, assured the BJP government repeatedly
 To remind, this struggle journey started from Chandrapur city of Vidarbha and has now reached Kolhapur in the third phase
 kolhapur shahar main pahunchi ye sangharsh yatra mencongress or rashtravaadi congresske netaaon ne pehle rajshri shahu maharaj janmasthal par abhivadan kar, kolhapur kii kuladevi amba mata ke darshan liye
 In this struggle, senior Congress leader and former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chauhan, a senior Nationalist Congress leader and former Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, veteran Nationalist Congress leader and former irrigation minister Sunil Tatkare, current anti-party leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, MLA h Sun Mushrif, MP Dhananjay Mahadik is present
 patrakaron se baatcheet ke dauranjit pavarbole ki unhone amba mata ke charan sparsh kar ke prarthana kii ki ab or nahin chahie devendra fadanvis kii sarkaar, jald puraa ho inkaa kaarykaal
 At the same time, asked Amba Mata to give this government a good sense so that the farmers of the state forgive debt of those who are in debt
 virdohi paksh netaa radhakrishna vikhe patil ne kaha ki sau fisadi karja maaf kiye bagaiyr is sarkaar ke saamne koi or rasta nahin bachaa he
 If the Devendra Sarkar did not do so, then the people will face him in the next election
 radhakrishna vikhe patil rajya sarkaar ko ye yaad dilaane se nahin bhuule ki band pade hue tuar daal kharidi centre turant shuru kiye jaaen, tuar kii fasal lene vaale kisaanon kaa aakrosh or gussa shaayad sarkaar ko dikhaai nahin de rahaa he

 Former Delhi Minister Kapil Mishra in his blog targeted the Kejriwal government and also challenged the public disclosure of the Jal Board report
 kapil mishra ne aarope laagaaya he ki unke khilaaf jal board dwaara report banavaane kii koshish hui thi
 An attempt was made to make a report against me
 Mishra claimed that on the evening of 6th, Manish Sisodia said that due to poor performance in the water sector, Kapil Mishra was removed because of which the party lost in the corporation elections
 tabase ab tak kisi bhi tarah se mere khilaafjal borddwara report banavaane kii koshishen hui
 The Chief Minister himself asked the CEO for a report in which he did not know where half of Delhi's water goes and another was told to the new Minister Rajendra Gautam that a report about water bills should be made against me and the third assembly petition
 It was tried through the committee

 Since both the reports of DJB have not been made public, the first report clearly states that the Chief Minister's question is childish and perhaps he does not understand Delhi so he is asking such a question
 report kii bhashaa aadhikarik he par arth yaheen he
 Before the second report, the Water Board had asked the minister to tell one or two cases where they think the conspiracy took place
 is par rajendra gautam funs gaye or report ko gairasantoshajanak ghoshit kar diya
 Kapil challenged through questions, now the question is that if all the investigations and reports are saying that Kejriwal lied to Manish Sisodia that day then what is the meaning of this? Does Kejriwal dare to make these reports public? Kapil Mishra says that one thing has proved again today that after getting caught red handed in corruption and realizing that he cannot silence Kapil Mishra, so On the evening of 6 May, the decision to remove me was taken
