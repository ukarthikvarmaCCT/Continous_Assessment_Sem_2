 dilli daire davills ne 10 april ko jab firoz shah kotla maidan par mumbai indiens ke khilaaf indian premier lig (ipel) ke chauthe sanskaran kaa apana safar shuru kiya tha, tab kisi ko nahin pataa tha ki yah team apane aakhri lig mukaable tak jate-jate 10 tiimon kii talika main phiseddi sabit hogi
 In their very first match, the Daredevils had to face a crushing defeat by the Mumbai Indians by eight wickets
 iske baad uski haar kaa silsilaa kuch yun shuru hua ki agle 12 maichon main use aath baar shikast khaani padi
 a four-time win gave him some comfort but eight points were not enough to earn a respectable position in the table
 ab daire davills ko shanivaar ko kotla main apana aakhri lig match khelnaa he
 The Pune Warriors team will be in front of him, whose condition is also similar to the Dare Devils
 fark bas itnaa he ki pune warirs ne jeet ke saath ipel main kadam rakhaa tha lekin uske baad uske pradarshan kaa graph lagaataar girtaa rahaa
 Due to injury of captain Virender Sehwag and being out of the team, obviously the fans of Daredevils may not have been excited about the last league match but former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly is going to play his last match in IPL-4
 Viewers can turn to Kotla to watch
 ankon, jeet or haar ke lihaaj se daire davills or pune warirs kaa palada baraabar he lekin pichley teen muqablon par najar daalane se pataa chalata he ki pune ne teen main se ek match main jeet hasil kii he lekin daire davills ko teenon muqablon main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Well on April 17, Mumbai's Doctor D
 vaai
 In the first match played at the Patil Sports Complex, the Daredevils tasted a defeat to the Pune Warriors, but in the absence of Sehwag, it is not possible for him to do it again
 us match main pune warirs ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue 187 ran banaae the lekin iske baavjood daire davills ne david warner (46) or sahvaag (37) ke bich pehle wicket ke liye hue 75 ranon kii saajhedaari kii badaulat jeet hasil kii thi
 The Daredevils won their first win in IPL-4 by defeating the Pune Warriors after losing two consecutive matches against Mumbai and Rajasthan Royals
 vah jeet nishchit taur par khaas thi lekin uske baad daire davills kaa pradarshan itnaa kharaab rahaa ki teen baar semifinal khel chuki yah team talika main sabase neeche pahunch chuki he
 There is nothing left in the IPL-4 for Pune Warriors and Dare Devils
 play-of ke liye in do tiimon ke khilaadi darshak banakar rah gaye hai
 In such a situation, when these players become spectators themselves on Saturday, when they will play in front of the audience for the last time in IPL-4, they can be expected to play entertaining cricket without pressure
 pichley kuch samay se BCCI main chal rahi uthalputhal kaa asar indian premier lig (IPL) ke aagaamee sanskaran par bhi padataa dikh rahaa tha
 It was believed that there might be some changes in his schedule, while the bid for the players was also expected to be postponed

 ) So far, the Jharkhand Police is looking for another criminal record of professional paraphernalia
 ab wo maujuuda jharkhand vidhansabha ke 81 vidhayakon main se 59 vidhayakon ke aapraadhik record khangaal rahi he
 This includes legislators from the ruling party as well as the opposition
 darasal jharkhand hai court main daayar ek janhit yachika kii sunwaayee karte hue court ne jharkhand police ko 12 sitambar tak is babat jabaab daakhil karne ko kaha he
 Jharkhand Against Corruption filed a petition against 59 mlas in the Jharkhand High Court
 jiske baad kaaryvahak mukhya-nyaayadhish nyaayamurti di
 N
 patel or nyaayamurti es
 Chandrashekhar's court has ordered the Jharkhand Police to inform the court about the new criminal cases related to the old criminal records of these mlas
 nyaayalay ke is aadesh ke baad jharkhand police mukhyalay ne sabhi jilon ke espi ko vidhayakon ke bare main tathy jutaney ke nirdesh die he
 Also, many police officers of every district have been engaged in this work
 in 59 vidhayakon kii is list main JMM ke sabase adhik 17 vidhayak shaamil hai, jabaki bijepi or jharkhand vikaas morcha (JVM) ke 8-8 vidhayak or ajasu evam rajd ke 4 - 4 vidhayakon ke bhi naam hai
 In Jharkhand, there has been a significant increase in the cases registered against mlas in recent years
 jahaan 2005 main vidhayakon ke khilaaf 31 aapraadhik maamle lambit the
 At the same time, their number increased to 59 in 2009
 yahi nahin gambhir IPC maamle bhi 43 se badhkar 52 tak ja pahunche
 However, according to the National Election Watch and ASSOCIATION FOR DEMOCRATIC REFORM i
e
 ADR report, since 2004, one-fourth of the elected representatives have been facing serious criminal cases
 is dauraan sampann loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon main kul 1761 logon ne namakan bharaa tha, jisame se 525 yani 30 fisadi pratyaashiyon ne apane namakan ke samay unke upar chal rahe aapraadhik maamlo kii jaankaree di thi
 At the same time, according to the report, 189 mps and mlas (56 per cent), elected since 2004, had confessed to having criminal cases against them at the time of nomination
 yadi aankadon kii baat kii jaye to JMM ke kul chune gaye 38 vidhayakon / saansadon main se 29 (76 fisadi), congress ke 31 main 17 (55 fisadi), bijepi ke 57 main se 23 (40 fisadi), rajd ke 14 main se 7 (50 fisadi) or JVM ke 11 main se 8 (72 fisadi ) par aapraadhik maamle darj hai
 Some interesting facts have also come out of this report
 in 1761 pratyaashiyon main maatr 109 yani 6 fisadi hi mahila pratyaashee thi, jinamein se 21 yani 19 fisadi par aapraadhik maamle darj the
 However, out of the 15 women candidates who won the election, only 1 has a criminal case
 vahiin chunaav jitne vaale daagi saansad / vidhayako main 24 fisadi graduate he, jabaki 27 fisadi vaise hai jo kam padhe-likhe yani barahavin tak shiksha pai he
 a quarter of the mlas of the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly are on the CBI radar regarding the horse trading case in recent times
 vaise jharkhand nirdaliyon ke karname ko lekar pehle se hi badnaam rahaa he
 Independents had silver during the reign of independent chief minister Madhu Koda
 kebinet ke 12 mantriyon ke cote main se aadhe se adhik vidhayak gaban, ghotaalaa or aay se adhik sampatti hasil karne ke maamle main jail kii hawa kha chuke he
 People even went on to say that they had looted Jharkhand by forming a gang of ministers
 vaise kodaa shasankaal main congress baahar se samarthan de rahi thi lekin JMM ke netritvvali hemanth sorain sarkaar main is baar congress or argedy shaamil he
 The same independents are still excluded
 lekin jis tarah se mananeeyon kii daagi chhavi saamne aa rahi he wo apane aap main dilachasp he
 Now we have to see what is the stand of the High Court in the case of tainted mlas

 mamata ke chir-parichit tevar main 'badal do, badal do, dilli main sarkaar badal do' ke aahvaan ko unke prashansakon ne mamata kaa masterstroke bataaya he
 This slogan is being mottoed by his party's motto 'maa, Mati, Manush', which he coined before the 2009 general election and which in 2011, left the Left Front, which ruled West Bengal for 35 years, out of power

 bangladesh kii is jeet ke saath jis tarah kii sthitiyaan ban rahi hai usase to yahi lag rahaa he ki quarter final main bharat kaa saamana bangladesh se hoga
 Even the big teams like India need to be cautious of the feat that Bangladesh has done in the cricket world
 kyonki yahi wo bangladesh kii team he jisane 2007 ke world cap main bharat ko haraakar ghar vaapasi kara di thi
 There were many occasions in the match against England when it was felt that Bangladesh's inexperience will come in the way, but the maturity of this team, which was decorated with young players, was amazing
 captain mashrafe murtaja kaa anubhav, yuva taskin ahamed kii dhardaar gendbaaji or rubell hossain kaa aakraamak tevar or swing kisi bhi team ke liye mushkilen khadi kar sakati he
 However, despite this win, Bangladesh need to improve their batting and top order batsmen
 bharat main jis tarah cricket ek dharm kii tarah he, thik usee tarah bangladesh main bhi yah khel logon ke liye ek junun he
 Till now the whole world was also questioning the Test status of Bangladesh, but the Bangla Tigers have given the right answer to the critics due to their blatant performance in the World Cup
 quarter final tak kaa safar bangladesh ke liye kisi world cap jeetne se kam nahin he
 Bangladesh reach the quarter-finals is not an issue, but they have played a tremendous game
 apane pehle match main afghanistan ko 105 ranon se raundkar apane abhiyaan kii shandaar shuruyaat kii
 After this, his match with Australia was lost to rain
 lekin jab saamana srilanka se hua to bangla tigers tillakaratne dilashaan or kumaar sangakara ke shatakon ke saamne dher ho gaye, or unhen 92 ranon kii karaari shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 But he kept his hopes alive against Scotland by scoring a mammoth 319-run target
 phir england par aitihaasik jeet darj kar ke bangladesh ne quarter final main apni jagah pakki kar lee
 India will face Bangladesh in the quarter-finals, this is Mathematics India is currently on top in Pool b by winning all four matches with 8 points, and chances are that India will remain on top
 bangladesh pool e main he or ve philhal tisare sthaan par hai, lekin abhi unhen newjiland se khelnaa he
 The way New Zealand has beaten all the teams so far, it is expected that New Zealand will beat Bangladesh
 udhar pool e main srilanka chauthe sthaan par he or unka ek match scotland se baaki he
 In such a situation, if Sri Lanka defeats Scotland and Bangladesh loses to New Zealand, then Bangladesh will be at number four in Pool A
 aise main quarter final main unka saamana pool bi kii number van team bharat se hoga
 In Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, a 16-year-old Muslim boy was beaten up by unknown people for allegedly not speaking 'jai Shri Ram'
 police kii report ke mutabik, ghatana shuukravaar kii he or us vakt barraa ilaake kaa rahane vaala ladkaa mohammad taj kidawai nagar main namaaj adaa karne ke baad ghar laut rahaa tha

 aam aadmi party se alag hue nai party 'swaraj india' ke adhyaksh yogendra yadav arvind kejariwal sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par jamkar barase
 Regarding the way there is constant tension between the Chief Minister and LG in Delhi, Yogendra Yadav said that the Kejriwal government is busy in quarreling rather than working
 unhone kaha ki kejariwal sarkaar naaraa detii he, 'wo pareshaan karte rahe or ham kaam karte rahe
 "while Kejriwal is the real slogan of the government in Delhi," he continued to harass, we kept chugging
 ' unhone kaha ki aam aadmi party ne chunaav ke samay jhuggi waalon ko apane saath joda tha lekin vahiin jeje cell ke adhyaksh umesh verma neswaraj partika daaman tham liya
 Cheating slum dwellers: Yogendra Yadav alleged that the government has cheated the unauthorized colony and slum dwellers
 dilli kii ek badi aabaadijhuggi-jhopadior anaadhikrut coloniyon main rahati he
 According to the 2011 census, there are a total of 3,68,893 slums, in which 17,85,390 people live
 itani badi aabaadi saalon se upekshit he, aae din jhuggiyaan todi jaati hai
 Before elections, all parties make big promises without thinking, show dreams but do not turn around after winning
 agar dekhati bhi hai to unka ashiana ujaadne ke liye
 The Congress, BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party all parties used slum dwellers as a vote bank only to run bulldozers on the slums and later defraud them
 jhuggi-jhopadi ke logon ne pehle congress se ummid rakhi lekin dhokhaa hi haath laga
 In 2006, the Congress passed a bill from Parliament that without rehabilitation no slums would be broken
 ise 31 disambar 2017 tak vistaar mila he lekin iske baavjood bulldozer chalata rahata he
 In 2013, the BJP gave the slogan 'where the slum is there' but nothing was done after winning the election
 jhuggiyon main rah rahe logon ko bijepi kii niyat par hi bharosa nahin he
 After the arrival of the Aam Aadmi Party, the people of the slum came in support of the party
 party ne chunaav purv vaada kiya ki sarkaar banane ke ek saal ke bheetar sabhi anaadhikrut coloniyon ko adhikrut kar diya jayega
 But even a year and a half after Aam Aadmi Party formed the government, a step was not taken to complete this work
 arvind kejarivalane vaada kiya tha ki 1 janvari 2015 tak basii jhuggiyon ko nahin todaa jayega
 However, after the formation of the government, he passed it in the cabinet that till 2006 the slum settlement will not be broken
 yani 2006 ke baad basii jhuggi ko todaa ja saktaa he
 Aam Aadmi Party talks about Mohalla Sabha in everything
 lekin dilli main juggi-jhopadi or jeje basti hataane ke draft protocol main jab yah suzav aayaa ki kisi bhi jhuggi-jhopadi ko hataane yaa punarvaas ke liye 80% logon kii sahmati lee jaae to dilli sarkaar ne DSUIB Act 2010 kaa sahaara liya or purv sahmati ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 The Aam Aadmi Party also tricked the slum dwellers
 swaraj india sunegi aam janata kii batsabhi partiyon se niraash hokar jhuggi-jhopadi or anaadhikrut kollani ke logon ke adhikaar ke liye sangharsh karne vaale kai pratinidhi aaj umesh verma ke netritv main swaraj india se jude
 Yogendra Yadav, President of Swaraj India, welcomed him at a press conference wearing a yellow stripe
 media se baat karte hueyogendra yadavane kaha ki 'swaraj india' aam janata ke saath baithkar jhuggi-jhopadi or anaadhikrut kollani ke logon kii samasyaon ko sunegi, unki aawaaj ko shashakt karegi or is sangharsh ko eemaandaaree se aage badhayegi

 PM narendra modi ke tabadatod gujarat daure ke samaapan ke saath hi aisi khabaren aa rahi hai ki nirvachan ayog aaj ko gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke liye matdaan kaarykram kii ghoshnaa kar saktaa he
 According to highly placed sources of the commission, it is possible that by this evening the election program in Gujarat will be announced
 himachal pradesh ke chunavi kaarykram kaa elaan karte vakt bhi mukhya chunaav ayukta eke joti ne kaha tha ki gujarat ke chunaav kii tithiyaan bhi jald ghoshit hongi
 The counting of Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat assembly elections is to be held simultaneously on December 18
 ayog ne himachal pradesh ke chunaav kii tithi 9 november ghoshit kar di thi, lekin gujarat vidhansabha chunaav kii tithiyaan ghoshit na karne ko lekarayog kii manshaa par bhi sawalia nigahenuthi thim
 Other political parties including the Congress had alleged that the Commission is also waiting for PM Modi's election rally to be held in Ahmedabad on October 16
 Even during the announcement of Himachal elections, Aaj Tak had asked Chief Election Commissioner AK Joti that what is the reason behind not declaring the Gujarat elections? CEC Joti's answer was first to the Supreme Court that 85 days is enough time for election announcement and voting day, and the term of Gujarat assembly will end in January
 rahi baat himachal ke chunaav jald karaane kii to vahaan kuch jilon main november madhya ke baad barfbaari kii vajah se mausam bighad jaataa he, to matadaata apane matadhikaar kaa prayog nahin kar pate
 When the question was asked for the second time, AK Joti also changed the answer after realizing that the answer could not be shaken on everyone's faces
 abaki unki daleel thi ki gujarat main pichley maheene ai baadh se kai jilon main log beghar hai, gaanv bah gaye hai, log asthai thikaanon par rah rahe hai
 His identity will also take time
 isliye gujarat sarkaar ne thodi mohalat maangi he
 Now the Commission must have thought of a suitable answer to the question that in 10 days the Rupani government did the magic wand by doing all these things? Although people kept speaking with a strong word on the intention of the Commission, but Congress leader P
 Chidambaram It also took a dig at the Commission that the commission has given the responsibility of declaring the Gujarat elections to PM Modi
 himachal vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal agle saal 7 janvari ko khatm ho rahaa he, jabaki gujarat vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal 22 janvari ko khatm ho rahaa he
 At present, a separate exercise by the Commission to declare the Gujarat assembly election program within a span of 15 days will give an opportunity to point fingers at its autonomous and independent constitutional framework
 gauratlab he ki PM modi bhi aaj vadodara main jansabha ke dauranirvachan ayog kaa bachaavkarte najar aae
 On the contrary, he targeted the opposition parties including Congress and said that people are having stomach pain when i come to Vadodara on Diwali
 mujhe to kuch kah nahin sakate isliye chunaav ayog par dabaav bana rahe hai
 But i want to tell them that they have no right to point fingers at the Election Commission

 According to the MCD, about 700 engineers are deployed in its different departments, out of which around 250 engineers are facing different cases

 If this is the condition then how will the accident stop
 is bich, emsidi is masale par sakht kadam uthaane kii baat kar rahi he
 Standing Committee Northern Municipal Corporation chairman Mohan Bhardwaj says that he will get the matter investigated as to why the CVC was not given a reply

 Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar questioned the proposals made by Sonia Gandhi-led NAC to provide food grains at a cheaper rate to 75 percent of the country's population, and said that the decision taken by the Jawaharlal Nehru Government regarding nationalization of food grains Had to be withdrawn within just 10 days
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha,main puraane achche dinon kaa samaran karata hum jab main yuva tha or congress main tha
 This decision was taken in the All India Congress Committee (AICC) and the decision was withdrawn within 10 days
 us samay jawaharlal nehru pradhanmantri the
 At the Economic Editors' Conference he was asked where food grains would come from in order to implement the National Advisory Council (NAC) consultations for the National Food Security Act and whether his government would nationalize foodgrains for this
 samprag adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii aguwai vaale enesi ne prastaav kiya he ki sabsidiprapt khadyannon ko praathmik or saamaanya pariwaron kii do shreniyon ke tahat kanoonee taur par praapt karne kaa adhikaar diya janaa chahie
 It covers 75 percent of the country's population
 is kanoon ke bare main enesi kii siforeeshon ke bare main pavaar ne kaha ki unhen prastaavon ke bare main keval press media se hi pataa chalaa he tathaise maukey par mere liye yah kahana anumaan par aadhaarit hoga ki antat: yah kanoon kya rup legaa
 Pawar said that about 18 under the National Food Security Act to implement the recent recommendations of the NAC based on the rough estimates of his ministry based on media reports
 6 karod parivaar(prayek parivaar main paanch sadsy) ko kanoon ke daayre main liya jaayegaa tathaa iske liye 6
 2 million tonnes of food grains will be required
 unhone kaha ki 6
 Above 20 million tonnes, the government will need more food grains for welfare schemes, functional reserves, buffer stocks and open market sale schemes
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar pichley kuch varshon se ausatan kareeb 5
 Has been buying 50 million tonnes of wheat and rice
 pavaar ne kaha ki peedies ke jariye khadyannon kaa jo vitaran 2001-02 main maatr 1
 Today it used to be 2 million tons, it has increased to 4 today
 38 karod ton ho gaya he
 He said that despite the good aspects of the proposed Food Security Act, it is certain that once the law is implemented, the foodgrains delivered through PDS will be much higher at the current level
 maujuuda samay main sarkaar peedies ke tahat 18
 Provides cheap food grains to 04 crore families, of which 6
 52 karod bipiel parivaar or 11
 5 crore APL families are included
 yah poochne par kya sarkaar gaiyr
 Basmati will allow the export of rice and wheat, Pawar said, "it is true that the production of rice, wheat and sugar is better this year
" ham in jinson ke niryaat ke bare main baat nahin kar rahe hai kyonki sarkaar khaadya suraksha kanoon kaa masauda taiyaar karne kii prakriya main he
 It is notable that non
 basmati chaaval or gehun ke niryaat ko pichley kuch varshon se pratibandhit kar diya gaya tha taaki inaki gharelu uplabdhta ko badhaate hue badhati keemton ko kaabo main rakhaa ja sake
 Justice V
 aar
 Krishna Iyer once said that the independence of the judiciary is more threatened than outsiders than those sitting within the judicial system
 sarvocch nyaayalay ke kuch nyaayadhishon kaa pradhan nyaayadhish ke khilaaf pichley hakrate kiya gaya durbhagyapurna vidroh, justise ayyar kii us tippanee kii pushti karata he
 It is beyond comprehension on what grounds some judges may claim to be senior in their own right and claim that their right to hear 'sensitive matters' is higher than others
 isliye aise maamle unke court ke samaksh hi aane chahie
 However, all judges are equal
 is baat ke peeche kya aadhaar he ki kaary kaa bantwaaraa karne ke pradhan nyaayadhish ke adhikaar kaa 'prajatantrikaran' nahin kiya gaya, to 'desh main loktantr nahin bachegaa'?aisi ashanka he to bina kisi agyaat pramaan ke janata ke bich jaakar usase kuch acshan kii apil karne se behatar hua hota ki adaalat hi ek aadesh paarit karke, kaary ke bantwaare kaa yah adhikaar bhi colegium ko saunpkar loktantr kii raksha kar leti
 Four judges have also alleged in their letter that less work is being done than the work required of the Supreme Court
 haalanki us patr main 'chaynaatmak cese aavanton' ke alaava anya koi mudda spasht rup se saamne nahin aayaa, par media reporton ke jariye is nyaayik sankat jaisi sthiti banane or use hawa dene main varisht adhivaktaaon kii bhoomika kaa pataa chalaa
 Recently, some senior attorneys generally address contempt for the language and conduct they demonstrated while addressing the Chief Justice
 kuch vakil jis prakaar se nyaaypalika kii aalochana kar rahe hai, televijan kaaryakramon main nyaayadhishon ke kaamkaaj par chhintakashi kar rahe hai, usase janata ke man main nyaaypalika ke prati sammaan ko thes pahunch rahaa he
 'bench Hunting' or 'bench Fixing' is a sport that lawyers play without any fear to pass an order of their choice
 or jab yah khel raajnneeti main sakriy vakil khelte hai, tab sarvocch nyaayalay kii kaarywahi ko lekar janata main waisi hi raay banati he jiskaa zikr vartmaan chaar nyaayadhishon ke patr main hua he
 There is no doubt that urgent reforms are needed in the justice system to protect it from judges who show a tendency towards judicial self-destruction
 is disha main pehla kadam hona chahie—ek javabdeh pranali kii sthapana
 a bill in this context was also introduced in Parliament a few years ago
 iske alaava nyaayamurti venkatchalaiya kii aguai vaale samvidhan samiksha ayog dwaara prastut report main sujhaaye sanshodhano ke anuroop badlaav karke, rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog (engeesi) adhinium ko phir se sansad main lekar aana chahie
 However, until judicial reforms are started, no judicial reforms will be successful

 He said that during the membership of Mulayam's state office, not appearing during the membership and avoiding the questions of media prisoners, it proves that Mulayam also knows that the SP who opposed Kushwaha joining BJP People are getting membership in SP today and they have no argument for it
 haidar ne kaha ki basapa se nishkasit kiye jane ke baad kushvaha ko bhaajapa ne apanaaya tha tab sapa ne paise lekar party main shaamil karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha, lekin aaj usee kushvaha parivaar ke prati sapa kaa achaanak moh kaise umad padaa? unhone ashanka jaahir kii ki kahin bhaajapa vaali sthit yahaan bhi to nahin he
 Congress state spokesperson Zeeshan Haider said that sp's greed of vote bank has exposed its tricks and character and face

 Hyder said that after being expelled from the BSP, Kushwaha was adopted by the BJP when the SP accused him of taking money and joining the party, but how did the sp's sudden fascination for the same Kushwaha family arise today? He expressed apprehension that the bjp-based man is not located here either
 haidar ne kaha ki basapa se nishkasit kiye jane ke baad kushvaha ko bhaajapa ne apanaaya tha tab sapa ne paise lekar party main shaamil karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha, lekin aaj usee kushvaha parivaar ke prati sapa kaa achaanak moh kaise umad padaa? unhone ashanka jaahir kii ki kahin bhaajapa vaali sthit yahaan bhi to nahin he
 In front of the country's largest government hospital, AIIMS, we meet 35-year-old Dinesh, who is buying medicines for heart diseases for his father
 vah kehete hai ki har rose hazaar-baarah sau rupee kharch ho janaa maamuli baat he
 Dinesh is troubled by the rising bill of medicine, but it is not his problem alone
 apane bhai kaa ilaaj karaane aae salmaan bhi mahangi dawaaon se pareshaan hai
 The skyrocketing prices of medicines are a headache for every patient and his family, because today the patient has to pay 70 percent of his expenses from his pocket if he falls ill
 aise haal main dawaaon kii keemten kam karnaa sarkaar kii praathamiktaaon main se ek hona chahie, lekin centre sarkaar ke 2 saal puraa hone se thik pehle jari jis ek niti kaa dastauez jari kiya he, vah pareshaan karne vaala he
 It is not only feared that medicines will be expensive in the coming days, but it can be expensive to get many necessities of life
 modi sarkaar kii nai intlexual property rhite (ipiar) policy kaa masauda isi saal 12 may ko jari kiya gaya, jise padhane se pataa chalata he ki sarkaar desh main or kade ipiar kanoon bananaa chaahati he
 This government policy talks about making Intellectual Property a marketable capital and economic weapon
 saath hi ye niti tamaam bhartiya or videshi korporate companiyon ko ipiar kanoon kaa adhik se adhik istemaal karne or patent raaj ko badhaane ke liye utsahit karti he
 The government says that this policy will encourage new discoveries and inventions, but experts doing research on the WTO are not convinced
 dilli sthit bhartiya videsh vyapaar santhaan main centre for dablutio studies ke pramukh professor abhijit das kehete hai, 'aaj tak kahin bhi ye sabit nahin hua he ki kade ipiar kanoon avishkaar auki nai khojon ko badhaava dete hai
 Therefore to say that stringent iprs are being made for new discoveries, i do not agree with this
 ' The government is linking the new policy with the slogan of Creative India, Innovative India, but behind this policy there is pressure from American multinationals who want to increase the patent reign in the fields of medicine to agriculture and education
 sach ye he ki jab hamaare desh main krishi, shiksha, swasthya, udyog, technology or manoranjan ke alaava tamaam kshetron ke liye ipiar se jude kanoon pehle se hai jo dablutio jaisi antareashtriya sandhiyon ke mutabik hai
 
 
 In such a situation, the need for this policy is being questioned
 tippaniyan Legal researcher and policy expert Shalini Bhutani says, "there has always been pressure from American companies
 vah hamaare bazaar or arthvyavastha ko apane hisaab se chalaanaa chaahate hai
 We have many laws related to IPR in different areas that are compatible with the World Trade Organization standards, so we should not just change under US pressure
 ' Although the government is also saying in this policy that under the new IPR, it will take full care of the public interest along with the companies, but before Prime Minister Modi's visit to America, the question is that whether this change in our IPR policy is just It is for creativity or it is also for making America happy
 dawaaiyon kii aasmaan chooti keemten har marij or uske parivaar ke liye sirdard he, kyonki aaj marij ko biimaar padane par 70 fisad kharch apni jeb se dena padataa he
 In such a situation, reducing the prices of medicines should be one of the priorities of the government, but a policy document issued just before the completion of 2 years of the central government is disturbing
 usase na keval is baat kii ashanka he ki aane vaale dinon main dawaaen mahangi hongi, balki jindagi kii kai zaruuratein hasil karnaa mahangaa ho saktaa he
 The draft of the new Intellectual Property Right (IPR) policy of the Modi government was released on May 12 this year, which read that the government wants to enact more stringent IPR laws in the country
 sarkaar kii ye niti intlexul property ko bazaar main bikne laayak puunji or aarthik hathiyaar banane kii baat karata he
 At the same time, this policy encourages all Indian and foreign corporate companies to make more use of IPR law and increase the patent rule
 sarkaar kahati he ki is niti se nai-nai khojon or avishkaron ko badhaava milegaa, lekin dablutio par research kar rahe jaankaar isse sahamat nahin hai
 Professor Abhijit Das, head of the Center for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade in Delhi, says, "to date, nowhere has it been proven that stringent IPR laws encourage inventions and new discoveries
" isliye ye kahana ki nai khojon ke liye kade ipiar banaae ja rahe hai, main isse sahamat nahin hum
 ' nai niti ko sarkaar creative india, innovative india ke naare se jod rahi he, lekin is niti ke peeche america bahurashtriya companiyon kaa dabaav dikhataa he jo dawaaon se lekar krishi or shiksha ke kshetra main patent raaj ko badhanaa chaahati hai
 The truth is that when our country has laws related to IPR for all sectors other than agriculture, education, health, industry, technology and entertainment which are in accordance with international treaties like WTO
 
 
 aise main is niti kii zarurat par hi sawaal khadaa kiya ja rahaa he

 In the letter, said that if the law and order situation in the state worsens, will the commission take responsibility for it? He also asked the Election Commission to initiate an inquiry to find out how and under whose direction the decision to transfer senior police officers was taken
 banerjee ne apane patr main kaha ki meri yah drudh soch he ki bharat main loktantr bachaane main chunaav ayog kii nishpaksh bhoomika he
 But it is very unfortunate that i have to write this letter today to protest against the transfer order issued by the Election Commission of April 5, 2019, through which four senior officers were removed from their current posts, 'the letter said
 The verdict is highly arbitrary, motivated and biased
 hamaare paas yah yakeen karne ke saare kaaran hai ki ayog kaa faisla centre main sattarudh party, bhaajapa, ke ishaare par liya gaya

 Every Friday you wait for a new film and this time the new film is Kahaani 2, directed by Sujoy Ghosh and 'kahaani 2' franchise is 'kahaani' released in 2012, which people are considering as a sequel
 Let them tell you that this is not a sequel to the story
 ye ek alag kahani he or sirf brand 'kahani', yani naam kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Vidya Balan is also playing the main character in this film and joining them here are Arjun Rampal, Jugal Hansraj, Naisha Khanna, Manini Chaddha, Kharaj Mukherjee, Tota Roy Choudhary and now how to tell the story of 'kahaani 2' of the biggest difficulty Go because if you say anything about the suspense film, then there is a fear of being gritty, but let me tell you what you saw by watching the promo

 Now the matter of straightforward flaws and good news, first of all, the first thing is that if you sit down to compare it with the story, then maybe you do not feel the suspense as strong as the story was
 duusari baat jaise jaise film aage badhati he aapako purv-abhas hone lagata he kii aage kya hoga or koun shadyantr main shaamil he, iske alaava kuch sikvence lambii ho jaati hai masalan arjuna kaa chazing seen
 There is also a scene where you hear the voice of a character and understand who this person will be, so according to me, these were the shortcomings of the film and now the thing is the biggest feature of story 2, its theme, the other is its quality The story and the third biggest feature is its screenplay and all these things keep you tied and keep your eyes on the screen
 tippaniyan The mood of Tapan Basu's cinematography film brilliantly reflects the unseen aspects of Kolkata i

 Secondly, as the film progresses, you get a pre-perception of what will happen next and who is involved in the conspiracy, apart from this, some of the sequences get lengthy like Arjun's chasing scene
 ek seen aisa bhi hai jahaan aap ek kirdaar kii awaz sun kar samaj jate hai kii ye shaks koun hoga, to mere hisaab se ye thi film kii kaamiyaan or ab baat kuubiyon kii to kahani 2 kii sabase badi kubi he iskaa vishay, duusari kubi isaki kahani or teesri sabase badi kubi iskaa screenple or ye sari kuubiyaan aapako baandh ke rakhti he or parde par ankhen gadaaye rahete hai

 Omar Abdullah, the acting president of the opposition National Conference (NC), termed the Centre's decision to establish an IIM in Jammu region as "open-ended partisan politics" and strongly attacked Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti
 party ne kaha ki mahabuuba ne satta main rahane ke liye apni aatma bech di he
 The former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir said in his tweet, 'jammu has also got iits and iims
 ve sabhi awaajen kahaan hai, jo jammu-kashmir ke santulit vikaas ke liye uthati thim'
 He was reacting to the approval of the Union Cabinet to establish the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) in the Jammu region
 isse pehle, jammu kshetra ke liye bhartiya praudyogiki santhaan (iaiti) kii sthapana kii gai thi
 Omar said that the decision to approve the establishment of iims for Jammu is similar to the open-ended partisan politics we were expecting from the BJP-PDP coalition government
 isamen koi aashcharya nahin ki rajya kaa itnaa hissaa aaj ashaant he
 The leader of the National Conference said that when Kashmir was given an All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jammu too successfully agitated to demand the establishment of an AIIMS
 unhone kaha, 'ab yah pakshpaat kyon
 And don't tell me that the outer campus is enough, because if it was IIM would have been set up in Kashmir and the outer campus could have been set up in Jammu '
 tippaniyan Omar attacked Mehbooba, saying that he had sold his soul to stay in power
 umr ne kaha, 'mujhe mahasoos hota he ki mahabuuba mufti ne satta main bane rahane ke liye apane rajnatik agenda ko bech diya he, lekin maine yah nahin mahasoos kiya ki unhone apni aatma bhi bech daali he'

 In Karnataka, the congress-jds coalition government (jds-congress coalition) seems to be in crisis due to the Bharatiya Janata Party and sometimes because of infighting between Congress leader Siddaramaiah and Deve Gowda
 karnataka main donon partiyon ke bich manmutav se mukhyamantri kumaraswami itane pareshaan hai ki vah do apane istife kii manshaa jataa chuke hai
 Questions are beginning to be raised for the second time within 15 days about the existence of the JDS Congress coalition government
 pichhali baar bijepi sarkaar giraanaa chaahati thi, is baar mukhyamantri kumaraswami khud pad chhodana chaahate hai
 The reason is the important confrontation between former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and JDS supremo HD Deve Gowda for almost one and a half decades
 party ke baithak main kumaraswami ne ek hafte ke dauraan duusari baar pad chhodane kii baat kahi he
 Amid signs of cracks in Karnataka's coalition government, Janata Dal (secular) chief Deve Gowda condemned Congress leaders who targeted HD Kumaraswamy and warned that he would not sit silent on the matter any longer
 purv pradhan mantri devegoda ne maang kii ki congress apane vidhayakon ko aise tippanee karne se roke, jo unke kaamkaaji sambandhon ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 He said is there any way to run this coalition government? Every day we have to request our coalition partner not to make such unparliamentary remarks? ”deve Gowda claimed that he was in“ pain ”since his son became the chief minister half a year ago
 unhone kaha ki in chah maheenon main sabhi tarah kii chijen hui hai
 i haven't opened my mouth yet, but i can't keep quiet anymore
 ' aage devgauda kaa kahana he ki 'meri ye koshish he ki saajha sarkaar sahi dhang se chale lekin congress netaaon ko apni jubaan qaabu main rakhni hogi
 If this is not done then there will be trouble and the central leadership of the Congress should understand this
 karnataka ke mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami ne kaha ki 'mere pitaaji ne pradhanmantri kaa pad chhodane main ek mint kii deree nahi kii aapako kya lagata he main aaplogon kii upeksha kar apane pad par bana rahoonga
 'chief Minister H

 di
 Kumaraswamy again threatened that he would resign if the Congress leaders kept attacking him
 unhone kaha, ‘‘haa, maine kaha tha ki agar congress ke netaa mujhe nishaanaa banaate rahe to main pad chhod duungaa
 Addressing the National Conference of JDS, he said, "if they (congress leaders) will make such statements again, how long will i continue to tolerate all this
" satta to alpakaalik he
 The one who is permanent is AAP (party worker) and this state has six and a half crore people
 'darasal haal hi main siddharmaiyya keme ke ek vidhayak ne kumaraswami ke kaam karne ke taur tareeqon par sawaal uthaae the
 Kumaraswamy is angry with this and there are other reasons
 1996 main jab devegoda ko pradhanmantri banaaya gaya tab siddharmaiya ko laga ki devegoda unhen mukhyamantri bana denge lekin aisa nahin hua
 In 2004, Siddaramaiah, who sat in Khar Khay, once again felt that Deve Gowda would not allow him to become the chief minister and then quit the JDS and joined the Congress, later Kumaraswamy became the chief minister
 maamla yahaan nahin thama vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan devegoda ne siddharmaiyya ke khilaaf jaanboojhkar ji tii devegoda ko chamundeshwari se chunaav ladvaya or siddharmaiyya haar gaye
 On POK, Army Chief said- Army ready for any operation

 unhone kaha ki aise maamalon main faisla sarkaar ko karnaa hota he
 The institutions of the country operate according to the orders of the government
 saath hi unhone kaha ki sena kisi bhi aadesh or abhiyaan ke liye hameshaa taiyaar he
 Indeed, Jitendra Singh recently made the statement that the next agenda is to regain pok
 modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal ke 100 dinon kii sabase badi uplabdhiyon par baat karte hue unhone kaha tha ki hamaara aglaa agenda pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir ko bharat kaa abhinn hissaa bananaa he
 He had said that it is not only my or my party's commitment but it is a unanimous resolution passed by the then Congress government led by PV Narasimha Rao in 1994
 yah ek sweekaarya rukh he
 On the propaganda campaign launched by Pakistan on ending most of the provisions of Article 370, Singh had said that the world is favorable to India
 unhone kaha, 'kuch desh jo bharat ke rukh se sahamat nahin the, ab ve hamaare rukh se sahamat hai
 Meanwhile, the army chief said that the government will decide according to the government on pok, according to them
 sena kii taiyaari ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki sena sarkaar ke kisi bhi abhiyaan ke liye puri tarah taiyaar he
 In the wake of the Rajya Sabha elections, the Election Commission has sought reply from ADG Anurag Gupta of Special Branch on the issue of CD and audio of the sting operation by Babulal Marandi, the supremo of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha
 ayog ne isse sambandhit patr sarkaar ko bheja he
 The Home Department has sent the letter to the police headquarters
 aaropon par den jawaab anuraag: ecayoga ne ediji se poocha ki he ki aap par jo aarope lagaaye gayi hai, us babat kya kahana he? ediji ko 12 agast tak patr kaa jawaab dena he

 What is the matter? Significantly, it has been alleged through the sting that Chief Minister Raghuvar Das also went to his house to get the votes of Yogendra Saw's wife and Congress MLA Nirmala Devi
 saath hi is sambandh main jharkhand ke ADGP anuraag gupta or salaahkaar ajay kumaar ne kai baar phone bhi kiye the

 The dollar has been steadily falling against the dollar
 haalanki shuukravaar ko rupee ne dollar ke mukaable majboot shuruyaat kii
 However, this record still remains at a declining level
 vishwa aarthik manch ke purv nideshak or think tanks horasis ke pramukh frank jargan richter kehete hai ki philhal rupee main giravat jari rah sakati he
 According to him, the situation has arisen at the international level
 agar aage bhi ye usee tarah se bane rahete hai to bharat kaa hi anumaan bataata he ki rupaya 76 ke paar pahunch saktaa he
 However this will depend on several factors
 is vajah se he giravatfrank nexjtak
 Talking to in told that whatever fall in rupee is being seen in the current time
 uske liye asian or vaishvik bazaar main machi uthal-puthal jimmedaar he
 Even in 2014, when the rupee crossed 60 against the dollar
 tab bhi dollar majboot tha
 The dollar still remains strong
 jo bhi cheez majboot hoti he, vittiya pravaah bhi uski taraf hi zyada hota he
 Investment is also affected, that is why the investment in India has also been affected
 iske alaava vah companiyaan bhi iske liye jimmedaar hai
 Those who have taken loans on dollar basis
 jab inaki reepement let ho jaati he, to majbootdollarfrm ke liye bhi behatar sabit nahin hota
 Richter says that a similar crisis has arisen in Turkey and this crisis is seen in other countries as well
 richter kehete hai ki ye bharat kaa khud kaa anumaan he ki agar rupaya 68 rupee ke ausat par bana rahata he, to 2020 tak yah 76 rupee prati dollar ke str par pahunch jayega
 Now the rupee has also crossed 72
 haalanki vah kehete hai ki 2019 main hone vaala chunaav is anumaan ko badhaane yaa ghataane kaa kaam kar saktaa he
 Not only elections, but how fast India completes its infrastructure projects, its impact will also be seen on the rupee
 kaccha tel bhi musiibat:richter kehete hai ki bharat bade str par tel aayaat karata he
 In such a situation, if the prices of crude oil continue to increase, then it will prove to be a problem for India
 isaki vajah sesarkaarake liye ranneetik yojana bana paanaa mushkil hota he
 On the other hand, the restrictions imposed by Iran on the US side are also making the road to India difficult
 iske alaava china or america ke bich jari trade war ko bhi giravat kii ahm vajahon main gina ja saktaa he
 What action can the RBI take? What steps can the Reserve Bank of India take to rein in the rising rupee? In response to this question, Richter says that i cannot say anything by referring to the central bank
 ve jarur apni internal meetings main is bare main baat karte honge
 The only possible step that the RBI can take at the moment is to lower or lower the base rate
 kyonki base rate kam yaa zyada karnaa kaaphi prabhavi kadam sabit hota he
 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said on Friday that he is not really worried about his Test form but also admitted that his 'poor shot selection' has become a problem for the last few days
 dhoni ne shanivaar ko nagpur main newjiland ke khilaaf shuru hone vaale tisare test se pehle kaha, ‘jahaan tak meri ballebaaji kii baat he to main match ke halaaton ke mutabik or net par acha khel rahaa hum
 The ball is coming well on my bat
 lekin maine ballebaaji karte vakt kuch aise faisle kiye hai jo galat rahe
 He said, 'I chose some bad shots while batting with tail-enders
 jab aap puchhlle ballebaajon ke saath ballebaaji karte ho to aap adhik pahal karnaa chaahate hai or bade shaat khilne kii koshish karte hai
 In this process you are out
 main sachmuch apni farm ko lekar chintit nahin hum
 When asked about the poor form of Suresh Raina, the captain defended the young player from Uttar Pradesh
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘vah pichley do maichon main hi score nahin bana paaya he
 He is a positive player and is mostly out in the process of playing big shots
 ’bhartiya team lagataar duusare din dopaher ko hui tej barish ke kaaran net par thik tarah se abhyaas nahin kar paayi he
 Only Sachin Tendulkar could bat for 20 minutes as the players had to return to the dressing room due to rain
 yah poochne par ki kya yah test match ke liye adarsh sthiti he to dhoni ne kaha ki kabhi kabhaar zyada abhyaas nahin karnaa madad karata he

 Preparations have been completed to make the sequel of the film 'force' made in 2011, but 'force' director Nishikant Kamath has left the film and replaced him with Abhinay
 yani 'force-2' kaa nirdesan ab nishikant nahin balki abhinay karenge
 The film is produced by Vipul Shah and will play John Abraham, who also starred in the film 'force'
 pehali film ne haalanki box offis par koi dhamaakaa nahin kiya tha
 But there was a fair response from the audience and critics
 film 'force' ek ection thriller film thi, jisamen jon ne jamkar ection kiya tha
 In this film, John played the role of an honest police officer, with whom Genelia d'souza worked with him
 vipul shah kii pichhali filmein 'force', 'commando' or 'holiday' ection filmein rahi hai, jisamen kahin na kahin unhen safalataa mili he
 Perhaps this is the reason why he is now focusing more on making action films
 vipul ne kaha he kii "force2 kii kahani original he jisamen jon ke kirdaar ke kai tah dekhne ko milenge
 The film will also have a romance with action
 abhinay is film kaa nirdesan karenge jo stylish nirdeshak kii pahchaan rakhte hai"
 Abhinay has previously directed the film 'delhi Belli' and the TV show '24'
 'force2' is saal sitambar main floor par jaayegi or 2916 main release hogi
 David Headley, who played a key role in the 26 November 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, may have been sentenced to 35 years of imprisonment by an American judge, but he has said that the Pakistani-origin American terrorist was indeed entitled to the death penalty

 The judge said, 'the 35-year sentence is not appropriate

 There is still about a year left for the Lok Sabha elections, but for this the political situation has started laying
 jahaan pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf vipaksh ekajute ho rahaa he, to vahiin endie ke sahyogi dalon main siton ke bantwaare ko lekar khinchataan shuru ho gai he
 This can make it difficult for the BJP
 khaskar bihar main is baar bijepi ke liye apane ghatak dal janata dal united (jediu), lok janashakti party (algepi) or rashtriya lok samta party (araspi) ko saath lekar chalanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 After the JDUK in Bihar, the LJP has now cleared its claim for seat-sharing in the Lok Sabha elections
 aljeepi pradesh adhyaksh or nitish sarkaar main pashu paalan mantri pashupati kumaar paras ne kaha ki saal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unki party saat siton par chunaav ladegi
 There is no question of contesting fewer seats than this
 isse pehle saal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye jediu 25 siton par daawa thok chuki he
 Bihar has 40 Lok Sabha seats, of which the BJP last contested 29 seats and LJP seven seats
 inamen se bijepi ko 22 siton or algepi ko chah siton par jeet mili thi
 Apart from this, RLSP of Upendra Kushwaha contested three seats
 aise main algepi ko saat siton se kam par chunaav ladane ke liye manaanaa bijepi ke liye badi chunauti he
 In the last Lok Sabha election, JDU had split from NDA and contested with the Grand Alliance, due to which BJP did not have any problem regarding seat sharing
 haalanki is baar jediu ke saath aane se aagaamee chunaav ke liye seat bantwaare kaa pench funs gaya he
 JDU has claimed to contest 25 out of 40 seats, while LJP has claimed seven seats
 iske alaava araspi bhi teen siton par chunaav ladane kii maang kar sakati he
 In such a situation, according to this math, BJP will have a total of five seats
 matlab saaf he ki bihar main siton ke bantwaare ko lekar formula taiyaar karnaa or sahyogi dalon ko raji karnaa bijepi ke liye badi chunauti hogi
 Now only time will tell whether the BJP is able to keep its constituents together
 upachunaavon main bijepi kii haar ke baad se tevar dikhaa rahe sahyogi dalgorakhpur, phulpur or kairana loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii haar ke baad se endie ke ghatak dal apana tevar dikhaa rahe hai
 They feel that there will not be a situation like the last Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 piem modi ke khilaaf ekajute vipaksh kadi chunauti pesh karegaa, jiske chalate bijepi ke paas apane sahyogi dalon ko saadhane kii majaburi hogi
 The BJP is also in awe of the manner in which the JDU, LJP and Shiv Sena have become vocal since the defeat of the BJP in the Lok Sabha by-elections
 yahi vajah he ki abhi se hi bijepi adhyaksh amit shah apane sahyogi dalon ko saadhane ke abhiyaan par nikal pade hai
 Vashiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray is currently in Mumbai
 iske baad unke paas bihar ke sahyogi dalon ko saadhane kii ranneeti par kaam karnaa padegaa
