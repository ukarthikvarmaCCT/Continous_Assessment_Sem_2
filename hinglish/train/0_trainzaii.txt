 BJP leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad termed the bandh as a democratic right and said who is responsible for the violence that has taken place

 The price of crude oil went up to USD 109 per barrel
 tab arun jetali ne kaha tha ki 90 dollar prati bairal hone par petrol 50 rupee litre hona chahie
 At the moment it is $ 78 per barrel, why don't Jaitley g 50 rupees a liter of petrol
 23 may 2012 ko hamaare sahyogi channel se baat karte hue ravishankar prasad kis jaankaree ke aadhaar par antarrashtriya kaarnon ke tark ko riject kar rahe the
 Then our colleague Anchor had asked Prasad what he would have done if he was in power and he had said that when we come to power, we will manage the economy in such a way that it can tolerate such a setback
 ab sawaal unheen se he ki aapane kya manage kiya he ki jhatka bardaasht nahin ho paa rahaa he or petrol 89 rupaya litre ho gaya
 This did not happen even during the UPA

 After the arrival of the Modi government in 2014, the price of crude oil in the international market had fallen to around $ 41 per barrel by 2016

 So you heard
 dijal or petrol kaa badhanaa hamaare haath ke baahar he
 Would this not have been the international cause during the Bharat Bandh of BJP? phir tab vipaksh ne bharat band kyon kiya
 Then why did Ravi Shankar Prasad ride a bicycle taking part in the bandh
 ek video main ravishankar prasad cycle chalaate hue petrol deazal ke daam kaa virodh karte dikhte hai
 Even at that time there were international reasons
 kachche tel kaa daam 109 dollars prati bairal tak ho gaya tha
 Then Arun Jaitley had said that petrol should be 50 rupees a liter at $ 90 per barrel
 is vakt 78 dollar prati bairal he, jetali ji 50 rupee litre petrol kyon nahin kar dete hai
 Talking to our affiliate channel on 23 May 2012, Ravi Shankar Prasad was rejecting the logic of international causes based on what information
 tab hamaari sahyogi ankar ne prasad se poocha tha ki aap satta main hote to kya karte to unhone kaha tha ham jab satta main aaengo to arthvyavastha ko is tarah se manage karenge ki aise jatke ko bardaasht kar le
 Now the question is from them that what you have managed is that the shock is unable to be tolerated and petrol has been reduced to 89 rupees a liter
 ye to upie ke samay bhi nahin hua tha
 In this reply, Ravi Shankar Prasad is also saying that he understands the rise in the price of crude oil, but even when the price of crude oil is low, the government does not reduce the price of petrol diesel
 2014 main modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad to international market main kachche tel kii keemat girte girte 2016 tak kareeb 41 dollars prati bairal ho gai thi
 Did the prices come down in the ratio in which the price of crude oil decreased
 2012 main kachche tel kii ausat keemat 109 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch gai
 Then petrol 73 in May 2012 in Delhi
 18 rupee litre pahunch gaya tha
 In 2017, when the average price of crude oil was 52
 51 dollar prati bairal ho gai
 Then in Delhi on 3rd Sibantar 2017 69 was 55 paise per liter
 aap dekh sakenge ki endieke samay kachche tel kii keemat kareeb 51 dollar prati bairal hone par bhi petrol 69 rupee litre mila or upie ke samay 2012 main 107 dollar prati bairal hone par kareeb 69 rupee prati litre aapane diya
 This is a game
 aaj congress or bijepi ke bich twitor par graphics ke zarie bhi jang hui
 The BJP has not stated the ratio of crude oil prices in its graphics
 bijepi ke graphics chart ke anusaar 16 may 2004 ko petrol 33
 71 paisa was liter, which was 40 rupees 62 paise on 16 May 2009
 yani paanch saal main 20 pratishat zyada badha
 Then on May 16, 2014, 71 rupees 41 paise per liter i
e
 75
 8 pratishat bad gaya
 Now on September 10, 2018, 80 rupees 73 paise per liter, which has been reduced by 13 percent
 kya vaaki daam ghate hai
 In response to this, Congress has tweeted
 congress ne kachche tel ke daam ke anusaar bataaya he
 According to this chart, in August 2009 and September 2018, both the time the price of crude oil 71
 9 dollars prati bairal thi
 In comparison, on 10 August 2009, petrol in the UPA government was 44 rupees 63 paise
 modi sarkaar main 10 sitambar 2018 ko 80 rupee 73 paise prati litre ho gaya he
 Price increase that decreased
 janata congress bijepi kaa iz iklaval tu game dekh rahi he
 bjp's graphics have reduced prices while your pocket has increased
 kya kamai badi
 Anandya Chakraborty has told in his simple news that 8 of GDP
 2 pratishat hone ke baad bhi logon kii asli aamadani main kaaphi giravat ai he
 You can see the simple news of the actors on the website of NDTV
 unka kahana he ki aamadani se mudrasphiti ko edjust kar dene par kisaanon kii asli aamadani na dekhne laayak he na dikhaane laayak he
 Between april-june 2017 to april-june 2018, income per farmer increased from Rs 100 to 101
 60 paise badi he
 That is, 1 rupee 60 paise
 yahi raftaar rahi to 100 se 200 hone main 44 saal lagenge
 Farmers' income will double by then
 tippaniyan It is good that till then BJP will remain the government because BJP President Amit Shah has said that BJP will remain in government for 50 years i
e
 till 2069
 ho saktaa he ki petrol deazal mahangaa hone or naukariyaan nahin milane ke baad bhi bhaajapa ko janata kaa apaar samarthan miltaa rahe lekin isaki vajah se janata ko takalif nahin he yah baat bhi sahi nahin
 Today, Rahul Singh of Hindustan Times reports that the Indian Army is going to reduce one and a half lakh jobs in the next 4-5 years
 iske liye june ke maheene main kader kii kshamta kii samiksha karne ke aadesh die gaye hai
 a panel of 11 members has been formed which will also consider reducing the number force
 baaki report aap hindustan times main padhein
 This information should be reached in time to the youths who run day and night to join the army in the village countryside
 andhra pradesh or rajasthan ne tex main kami kii he magar daam par koi khaas asar nahin he
 Rajasthan has reduced tax by 2 rupees 21 paise, yet petrol is 81 rupees 21 paise
 dijal 75 rupee 12 paise litre he
 During the Bharat Bandh in 2012, Arun Jaitley made an accurate prediction while in opposition
 yahi ki agar sarkaron ne tex ko sahi nahin kiya to is tarah ke pradarshan hote rahenge
 The public is happy in the politics of petrol and diesel
 ab uske paas dosha dene ke liye koi nahin bachaa he
 Now she will not be able to blame anyone for 50 years because Amit Shah has said that the BJP will remain in power for 50 years on the strength of its work
 kya us kaam main petrol or deazal ke daam kam karne kaa bhi kaam shaamil he
 It is a question or it is not a question at all
 ek video main ravishankar prasad cycle chalaate hue petrol deazal ke daam kaa virodh karte dikhte hai
 Even at that time there were international reasons
 kachche tel kaa daam 109 dollars prati bairal tak ho gaya tha
 Then Arun Jaitley had said that petrol should be 50 rupees a liter at $ 90 per barrel
 is vakt 78 dollar prati bairal he, jetali ji 50 rupee litre petrol kyon nahin kar dete hai
 Talking to our affiliate channel on 23 May 2012, Ravi Shankar Prasad was rejecting the logic of international causes based on what information

 This is a game

 Today, Rahul Singh of Hindustan Times reports that the Indian Army is going to reduce one and a half lakh jobs in the next 4-5 years
 iske liye june ke maheene main kader kii kshamta kii samiksha karne ke aadesh die gaye hai
 a panel of 11 members has been formed which will also consider reducing the number force
 baaki report aap hindustan times main padhein
 This information should be reached in time to the youths who run day and night to join the army in the village countryside
 andhra pradesh or rajasthan ne tex main kami kii he magar daam par koi khaas asar nahin he
 Rajasthan has reduced tax by 2 rupees 21 paise, yet petrol is 81 rupees 21 paise
 dijal 75 rupee 12 paise litre he
 During the Bharat Bandh in 2012, Arun Jaitley made an accurate prediction while in opposition
 yahi ki agar sarkaron ne tex ko sahi nahin kiya to is tarah ke pradarshan hote rahenge
 The public is happy in the politics of petrol and diesel
 ab uske paas dosha dene ke liye koi nahin bachaa he
 Now she will not be able to blame anyone for 50 years because Amit Shah has said that the BJP will remain in power for 50 years on the strength of its work
 kya us kaam main petrol or deazal ke daam kam karne kaa bhi kaam shaamil he
 It is a question or it is not a question at all
 23 may 2012 ko hamaare sahyogi channel se baat karte hue ravishankar prasad kis jaankaree ke aadhaar par antarrashtriya kaarnon ke tark ko riject kar rahe the
 Then our colleague Anchor had asked Prasad what he would have done if he was in power and he had said that when we come to power, we will manage the economy in such a way that it can tolerate such a setback
 ab sawaal unheen se he ki aapane kya manage kiya he ki jhatka bardaasht nahin ho paa rahaa he or petrol 89 rupaya litre ho gaya
 This did not happen even during the UPA
 is jawaab main ravishankar prasad yah bhi kah rahe hai ki ve kachche tel ke daam badhane kii baat samajhate hai lekin jab kachche tel kii keemat kam hoti he tab bhi sarkaar petrol deazal ke daam kam nahin karti he
 After the arrival of the Modi government in 2014, the price of crude oil in the international market had fallen to around $ 41 per barrel by 2016
 kya us anupaat main daam kam hue the jis anupaat main kachche tel kii keemat ghati thi
 In 2012, the average price of crude oil reached $ 109 per barrel
 tab dilli main may 2012 main petrol 73
 18 liters was reached
 2017 main jab kachche tel kii ausat keemat 52
 $ 51 per barrel
 tab dilli main 3 sibantar 2017 ko 69 rupee 55 paise prati litre tha
 You will be able to see that petrol got 69 rupees liter even when the price of crude oil was around $ 51 per barrel at the time of NDAK and you gave about 69 rupees per liter when UPA was $ 107 per barrel in 2012
 yah khel he
 Today, there was a war between the Congress and the BJP through graphics on Twitter
 bijepi ne apane graphics main kachche tel kii keemton kaa anupaat nahin bataaya he
 Petrol 33 on 16 May 2004 as per the bjp's graphics chart
 71 paise litre tha jo 16 may 2009 ko 40 rupee 62 paise hua
 That is, it increased by 20 percent in five years
 phir 16 may 2014 ko 71 rupee 41 paise prati litre hua yani 75
 Rose 8 percent
 ab 10 sitambar 2018 ko 80 rupee 73 paise prati litre hua he jo 13 pratishat gata he
 Are the prices really down? iske jawaab main congress kaa twit he
 The Congress has said according to the price of crude oil
 is chart ke anusaar agast 2009 or sitambar 2018 main donon time kachche tel kii keemat 71
 9 dollars per barrel
 uske mukaable main 10 agast 2009 ko upie kii sarkaar main petrol 44 rupee 63 paise litre tha
 In the Modi government, on 10 September 2018, 80 rupees has been 73 paise per liter
 daam badha ki gata

 Did earnings grow? aanindyon chakravarti ne apane simpal samachar main bataaya he ki jidipi ke 8
 Even after being 2 percent, the real income of the people has fallen significantly
 aanidyon kaa simple samachar aap enditivi kii website par dekh sakate hai
 He says that the real income of farmers is not worth seeing or showing after adjusting the inflation from income
 april-june 2017 se april-june 2018 ke bich prati kisaan aamadani 100 rupee se badhkar 101
 60 paise has been increased
 yani 1 rupee 60 paise
 If this pace is there then it will take 44 years to become 100 to 200
 kisaanon kii aamadani tab jaakar doguni hogi
 The comments acchhee baat he ki tab tak bhaajapa kii hi sarkaar rahegi kyonki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha he ki bhaajapa kii 50 saal tak yani 2069 tak sarkaar rahegi
 It may be that the BJP continues to get immense support from the public even after petrol diesel becomes expensive and jobs are not available, but because of this the public does not have any problem
 aaj hi hindustan times ke rahul singh kii khabar he ki bhartiya sena agle 4-5 saalon main dedh lakh naukariyaan kam karne ja rahi he

 In this reply, Ravi Shankar Prasad is also saying that he understands the rise in the price of crude oil, but even when the price of crude oil is low, the government does not reduce the price of petrol diesel

 The public is happy in the politics of petrol and diesel
 ab uske paas dosha dene ke liye koi nahin bachaa he
 Now she will not be able to blame anyone for 50 years because Amit Shah has said that the BJP will remain in power for 50 years on the strength of its work

 srilanka ke khilaaf vishakhapatnam tii-20 main aswin ne bharat ke liye is formet kii sarvshereshth gendbaaji kaa record apane naam kiya
 There is no doubt that he is in excellent form, but what are the other things that make Ashwin's trump card of India, he tries to know
 ravichandran aswin vah naam he, jiske chalate bharat world tii-20 kaa mukhya daavedaar he
 In terms of current form, he appears to be the best spinner in the world
 srilanka ke khilaaf unhone mahaj 8 ran par chaar wicket liye, jo bhartiya record he
 He broke his own record of four wickets for 11 runs against Australia
 aswin par bhartiya team ke captain dhoni ne kaha, agar aap dekhen to vah hamaare best gendbaaz hai or khaastaur par nai gend se vah or zyada asardaar sabit hote hai
 He flies with the new ball, inviting the batsman to take a big hit
 kai baar aap aise halaat main flats gendbaaji karne lagate hai, lekin aswin bahut acha mishran karte hai
 This allows the captain to use his fast bowlers in the middle overs
 matlab captain na sirf unase prabhavit he, balki unki ahmiyat ko samajhate hue bataa rahe hai ki aswin ke chalate bhartiya team main unhen zyada vikalp milte hai
 Ashwin was close to setting an Indian record of taking 5 wickets for the first time with 4 wickets in 3 overs

 Whether taking wickets in the middle overs or reducing the pace of runs, the ball is held in Ashwin's hand
 aswin captain ke plan ko bakhubi nibhaate hai
 Ashwin also lacks variety
 ballebaazi main bhi unka number 9 par aana team ko majbooti or santulan detaa he
 For now, it seems that the captain will use him as an opener in the World Cup
 aise main aswin to or ghaatak dikh hi rahe hai balki captain ko or vikalp bhi mil rahe hai
 Ravichandran Ashwin is the name that makes India the main contender for the World T20

 He took four wickets for just 8 runs against Sri Lanka, which is an Indian record
 unhone australia ke khilaaf 11 ran par chaar wicket kaa apana hi record todaa
 On Ashwin, the captain of the Indian team, Dhoni said, "if you see, he is our best bowler and especially with the new ball, he proves more effective
 nai gend se vah flite karte hai, ballebaaz ko bada hit lagane ke liye nyotaa dete hai
 Sometimes you start bowling flat under such conditions, but Ashwin mixes very well
 isse captain apane tej gendbaajon ko middle overs main istemaal kar saktaa he
 Meaning that the captain is not only impressed with them, but understanding their importance, they are saying that due to Ashwin, they have more options in the Indian team
 ek samay 3 over main 4 wicket lekar aswin pehali baar kisi bhartiya ke 5 wicket lene kaa record banane ke kareeb the
 On the international level, Ashwin is ranked 21st in the list of best T20 bowling performance

 Ashwin plays the captain's plan well
 aswin ke paas vividhtaon kii bhi kami nahin
 His batting at number 9 also gives the team strength and balance
 philhal yahi lagata he ki world cap main captain unhen salaami gendbaaj ke taur par istemaal karenge
 In such a situation, Ashwin is looking more lethal but the captain is also getting more options

 There is no response from Lalu Yadav or his MLA sons Tej Pratap and Tejashwi on this new charge of grabbing land in lieu of making a councilor from Governor Kota
 susheel modi ne lalu ko bihar kaa natervalaal kaha

 On Monday, a booklet was issued on behalf of the UP government at the Purton places

 (@ranisrkfc) on Aug 26, 2018 at 2:28pm PDTA post shared by King srk's Army (@kingsrksarmy) on Aug 4, 2018 at 1:58am PDT a meeting was called in the Delhi BJP office on Tuesday for the preparations for the Run for Unity
 lekin baithak main kaarykram kii taiyaariyon ke liye kam balki khaane ko lekar khub charchaa hui

 a new experiment has been launched by the regional Delhi BJP Netifin Party
 edia dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari kaa he or maqasad netaaon ke bich talmail baitaane ko lekar he
 Whenever Tiwari has to meet in the afternoon, it starts with the Tiffin Party
 tiffin party main bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh tiwari ke alaava rajya main bijepi ke padaadhikariyon samet tamaam netaa hissaa lete hai
 The leaders who are called for the party meeting, along with the information about coming to the meeting, are also asked to bring home a tiffin to eat with them
 saath hi yah ummid bhi kii jaati he ki netaa ek nahin balkicum se kam do logon khanalekar aaen taaki daftar main maujuud anya netaaon ke saath bhi vah khaanaa saajha kiya ja sake
 Such experiments are common in Delhi after Manoj Tiwari became BJP President, because in this, two purposes are fulfilled simultaneously

 This withdrawal will be made under Section 199 of the Companies Act, which allows a company to ask for a refund of the package received by the directors for any forgery or non-compliance with the law

 purv kendriya mantri pi chidambaram ne aankade jari karne vaale niti ayog par hamalaa bolte hue kaha he ki is bekaar sanstha ko band kar diya janaa chahie
 Actually, NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar and Chief Statistician Praveen Shrivastava released the revised GDP figures on Wednesday
 jisamen aankadon ko 2004- 05 ke aadhaar varsh ke bajaay 2011- 12 ke aadhaar varsh ke hisaab se sanshodhit kiya gaya he, taaki arthvyavastha kii adhik vaastavik tasviir saamne aa sake

 In a tweet, former Union Minister p Chidambaram reacted sharply when the government reduced the figures of the previous UPA government to the revised figures, saying, "NITI Aayog's revised GDP figures are a joke
 ve ek bura majaak hai
 Actually they are worse than a bad joke

 Asked whether it was a coincidence that only the UPA tenure GDP figures had been revised, Kumar said it was not a coincidence but a result of hard work done by CSO officers
 unhone kaha ki iske liye jo tarika apanaaya gaya he use pramukh sankhyikeevidon ne jaancha he
 Kumar said that the government does not intend to mislead or deliberately do anything

 The report of the Real Area Statistics Committee appointed by the National Statistics Commission at that time had said that the growth rate of the economy during the tenure of the UPA government was higher than the average growth rate of the last four years of the current government

 australia kaa melbern
 Pakistan vs England, World Cup Final
 bas ye kuch chijen hai jo aaj har pakistani ek baar phir apane jahan main yaad kar rahaa he
 Because the captain who won the only World Cup to Pakistan and taught his team to win, is now on the threshold of becoming the wazir-e-azam of his country
 ji, buudhvaar kopakistan main hue aam chunaavamein purv pakistani cricketer imran khan kii party pakistan taharik-e-insaaf sabase badi party banakar ubhari he
 The count has not been completed yet but Imran is not far from majority
 aisa shaayad pehali baar hi hoga jab koi antarrashtriya darje kaa itnaa bada khilaadi kisi desh kaa pramukh banegaa
 Pakistan's Awam has once again shown confidence in his captain
 1996 main raajnneeti main kadam rakhane vaale imran khan ne lagaataar vipaksh main aakraamak raajnneeti kii
 He was already popular in his country, which he also took political advantage
 lekin pichley kuch saal main jis tarah se unhone front par aakar sadak kii ladaai ladi usee ne imran ko pradhanmantri pad kaa prabal daavedaar bana diya
 In 2014, Imran Khan demonstrated across the country on corruption charges against the Nawaz Sharif government and demanded his resignation
 is dauraan imran khan apane samarthakon ke saath kareeb 100 din se bhi adhik tak sadakon par jame rahe or jabatak aashwaasan nahin mila imran nahin hate
 PTI has been running the government in Khyber Pakhtunwa province for the last 5 years and this time it is trying its luck all over the country
 apane pratidwandviyon kii tulana main imran khan soshal media par bhi kaaphi charchit maane jate hai
 Imran Khan is fighting elections with few promises such as improving the condition of homes, electricity supply, education and health services and acting on corruption in government, which are the biggest reasons for Pakistan's plight
 andolan ke alaava imran ne jis tarah cancer aspataal ke liye lambii ladaai ladi usne bhi pakistaniyon ke dilon main unke liye izzat or bhi badha di
 Just before the election, there were many revelations related to Imran Khan's personal life but despite this he continued to campaign
 or janata ne un vivaadon ko bhoolatey hue imran par puraa bharosa jataayaa
 Big political move, trying 5 seats, Kismapakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan is contesting from 5 different constituencies of the country this time
 paak ke punjab praant se vah 3 siton par apni kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 Apart from this, Khyber is also contesting one seat each from Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh province
 imran ne karachi (ene-243), lahore (ene-131), rawalpindi (ene-61), bannu (ene-26) or miyanwali (ene-95) se maidan main taal thok rakhaa he
 It is believed that behind his election from 5 places, an atmosphere is to be created in his favor from every side of the country, thereby clearing the way for him to become Prime Minister
 pehle bhi kar chuke hai aisaaisa nahin he ki imran pehali baar ek saath itane chunaav lard rahe hai
 Imran contested 4 seats in the 2013 general election and this time he is contesting from Karachi by increasing one seat
 haalanki 2013 ke chunaav main imran ke liye anubhav acha nahin rahaa tha kyonki vah lahore, rawalpindi, peshawar or miyanwali se chunaav lade the, jisamen lahore main unhen shikast mili thi or 3 main jeet hasil hui thi
 But later he gave up the Peshawar and Mianwali seats and lost both these seats in the by-elections
 puraa cricket jagat captain ke sathek ore imran khan janata ke bich apana samarthan badha rahe the, to vahiin unke saathi cricketron ne bhi apane phens se apane captain kaa saath dene kii apil kii
 Talking to Aaj Tak, former Pakistani veteran Javed Miandad said that Imran won us the World Cup
 pichley 15-20 saal main unhone samaaj ke liye kaaphi kaam kiya he, unke dwaara banaaya gaya cancer aspataal kaa phayda puure desh ko ho rahaa he
 He will prove to be a great Prime Minister of our country
 sirf javed miyandad hi nahin pakistan cricket team me imran khan ke puraane saathi rahe wasim akram or vakaar younus ne bhi pitiai kaa samarthan kiya he
 All the cricketers sought support for Imran through social media
 imran ke sir sena kaa haathchunaavon main imran kii jeet ke peeche sena kaa bhi haath bataaya ja rahaa he
 It is constantly being said that Imran Khan is the first choice of the Pakistani Army, so the Army is putting all its efforts to win Imran
 pakistan sena nahin chaahati ki koi sthir naagarik sarkaar satta main aae, kyonki isse prashasan par uskaa prabhaav kam hoga
 In such a situation, she is promoting Imran Khan's party
 imran khan kii soch sena kii soch se kaaphi milti julati he
 Imran Khan is thinking of adopting a path of dialogue with terrorist groups
 saath hi kattarpanthi sansthaaon or aatanki sanghathan ke saath malikar chalane main vishwaas rakhte hai
 In such a situation, many times the opposition also opposes him as Talibani Khan
 pakistani sena isliye bhi imran par daanv khel rahi he kyonki purv main navaj sharif kii party (piemail-en) or pakistan pipuls party donon hi bharat ke saath rishte sudhaarney par jor de chuke hai

 laguard ne kaha ki bharat ko is kshetra par or zyada dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 Removing the crisis from this region is necessary because many people in India depend on this area
 iske saath hi laguard ne kaha he ki bharat jaise desh ke liye rojgaar bhi ahm mudda he

 The hunger to catch the plans of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is increasing
 centre sarkaar ne jyon kuch elaan kiya nahin ki siem yogi nikal padate hai dilli
 
 or uttar pradesh ke liye us yojana ko yen ken prakaren lapakkar le aate hai
 Do not be surprised, this disclosure was made by Khudayogi Adityanath in an informal conversation with select journalists in Lucknow on Friday night
 They do it with all their strength to grab it
 misaal ke taur par centre sarkaar ne is bajet main army menuphaccharing jone ke liye do coridor kaa praavdhaan rakhaa tha, vitt mantri kaa bajet bhaashan sunate hi yogi adityanath dilli ke liye nikal pade or bundelkhand coridor ko army menuphaccharing jone ke liye le liya
 In the same budget, when the Finance Minister announced the creation of a "readymade garments hub", Yogi Adityanath went out to pick him up and he also brought the central government which wanted to bring it to Jharkhand
 isi saal ke bajet main jab modi sarkaar ne kai museum ke liye prastaav rakhaa to yogi ne ayodhya, elahabaad or gorakhpur ke liye teen museum lapak liye
 a museum will be built in Allahabad on Kumbh, while Ayodhya will have a museum on Ram and Ramayana
 isi tarah kendriya bajet main unhone uttar pradesh ke liye kai medical college sweekrut karvaa liye
 In the power sector too, Yogi Adityanath is ahead in taking plans, out of the 32 thousand Mazaras living in darkness till now, the Commitment of Electrification in 20 thousand Majras was also got the power minister done before the pm's meeting
 yogi adityanath in dinon jis project ke liye pradhanmantri se milte hai usee project ke liye unke mantri, vibhaag ke mantri se milte hai or us vibhaag ke sachiv dilli main us vibhaag ke sachiv se milte hai
 This trick of Yogi Adityanath is working to catch the plans
 yahi vajah he ki duusare rajya jab tak sochate hai tab tak yogi us yojana ko lekar uttar pradesh or lakhanu waapas pahunch chuke hote hai
 Regardless of how much politics has been done on Wing Commander Abhinandan, or why the government has wanted to take full credit for this bold move of the Air Force in its name, but in the midst of all this, the Government of Rajasthan rose above all things to praise the Wing Commander
 Has decided to teach in their schools
 abhinandan kii vaapasi ke saath hi rajasthan ke shiksha mantri ne is baat kii ghoshnaa kii thi or is saal ise paathyakram main shaamil kar liya gaya he iske saath hi pulavama hamalaa or balakot air strike kaa zikr bhi schuli paathyakram kaa hissaa ban gaya he
 The Gathrajasthan government of Abhinandan in Rajasthan schools has included the heroes of the state in the syllabus of the state schools, which also named Wing Commander Abhinandan
 darasal jab wing commander abhinandan kii rihaai ke liye puraa desh duaen kar rahaa tha tab rajasthan ke shiksha mantri govind singh dotasra ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki abhinandan kii veerta kii padhai rajasthan ke skulon main kii jaaegi
 In view of this, this year has been included in the syllabus
 silebus main air strike se lekar 12 miraj fiter kii kahanisatvin se lekar 10veen tak kii kitabon main pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad kis tarah se 12 miraj fiter vimaanon ne pakistan main air strike kii or uske baad pakistan ne jab javaabi hamalaa kiya wing commander abhinandan ne mig 21 se pakistan ke epa 26 ko kaise maar giraaya or uske baad kis tarah se abhinandan kii rihaai hui uski puri kahani silebus main rakhi gai he
 No mention of the government's contribution, however, it is not mentioned anywhere how many terrorists were killed in the Balakot air strike and what was the contribution of the central government in it
 jis tarah se bijepi daawa karti he ki modi sarkaar kii vajah se hi sab kuch ho paaya, is tarah kii kisi bhi baat ko kitaab main jagah nahin di gai he 
 It has been taken care to tell the story of the gallantry of the army as a whole
 rajyavardhan singh rathore sahit rajasthan ke gai diggajon kaa jikabhinandan ko kitaab main shaamil karne ke liye rajasthan se rishta bhi dhund liya gaya he 
 It says that Abhinandan's initial studies were written in Jodhpur because his father used to work in the Airforce here
 olympic padak jite rajyavardhan singh rathore ke bare main bhi unki uplabdhiyon ko likhaa gaya he
 There is also the story of Mrigendra Pratap in this chapter

 Both these birth certificates belong to Balakrishna and have been issued at different times
 or in dastavejon se bhi baalkrishna kii asaliyat par andeh bad gaya he
 The first birth certificate made from Haridwar municipality was issued in 1997 and it shows Indian citizenship of Balakrishna's parents

 These grenades were identified when the jawan's bag was passing through the X-ray machine of Chanking
 jiske baad jawan se poochtacha jari he
 Talking to Aaj Tak, SSP Manzoor Ahmed Dalal said that the two grenades that have been recovered come to work during training
 unhone bataaya ki kyonki yah grenade training ke dauraan istemaal hote hai, isaliye itane khatarnaak nahin hai
 The attack took place on Sunday
 It is notable that immediately after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Jammu and Kashmir attack on Sunday, a policeman was killed in a grenade attack on the CRPF camp in Nauhatta
 is hamale main 11 anya javaanon ke ghayal hone kii khabar thi, inamen CRPF ke chaar tathaa saat police jawan shaamil hai

 a day later, the Pakistan Air Force entered the Indian border and targeted Indian military targets
 iske ek din baad bhartiya sena ke teenon angon-thal sena, nausena or vayusena- kii sanyukt vaarta main bharat ne pakistani hamale kaa saboot diya
 During the ongoing tension in both the countries, Pakistan told four big lies, which Hindustan gave evidence and exposed it to the whole world
 pakistan ne sabase pehle kaha ki unhone bhartiya vayusena ke do vimaanon ko maar giraaya gaya he or teen payalton ko pakad liya gaya he
 The figure then became two aircraft and two pilots
 lekin sachai yah he ki bhartiya sena ne dekha tha ki pioke main do parachute utre hai, joki epa-16 ke do payalton ke the, jinhen bhartiya vayusena ke mig-21 ne maar giraaya tha
 Later in the evening, Pakistan changed its statement to say that there is only one Indian Air Force pilot in their custody
 bhartiya vayusena (aieef) ne guuruuvaar ko is baat kaa bhi saboot diya ki buudhvaar ko pakistan dwaara jammu-kashmir sthit bharat ke sainya thikaanon ko nishaanaa banaae jane ke hawaii hamale main ladaaku vimaan epa-16 kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha

 Kapoor said that Pakistan is lying about the use of the F-16 to target Indian military targets
 kapur ne kaha, 'eem-areem misaai (em-120 advanced medium range air tu air missile) kaa malba bharat ke rajori ilaake se baraamad kiya gaya
 The F-16 can carry missiles in the aircraft that Pakistan has
 'pakistan ne daawa kiya ki unhone jaan-boojhkar aisi jagah par bam giraae, jahaan naa koi insaan ho or naa ho koi sena kii chaowkee
 But the Indian Army says that while Pakistan was trying to target Indian military targets, the Pakistani aircraft were forced to return by India's mig, Sukhoi and Mirage planes
 air vaais marshall kapur ne kaha, 'pakistan ne daawa kiya ki vimaanon se khule ilaake main bam daage gaye, lekin asaliyat yah he ki pakistan ne sainya thikaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya, lekin unki yojanaon ko naakaam kar diya
 The iaf's swift action did not cause any significant damage

 mahal ne kaha ki pieef ne buudhvaar ko jammu-kashmir main ek brigate mukhyalay, batalian mukhyalay or logisticks ke addon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 In retaliation after the Pulwama attack, the Indian Air Force carried out a surgical strike in Balakot, Pakistan
 is dauraan bhartiya vayusena ke 12 miraj ladaaku vimaanon ne pakistan kii seemaa main ghuskar jaish-e-mohammad ke thikaanon ko dhwast kar diya
 According to media reports, around 200-300 terrorists of Jaish were piled into it
 lekin pakistan kaa kahana he ki bharat ke vimaanon ne keval khaali jagah par bam giraae gaye hai
 There were no casualties in this attack
 is par bhartiya sena ne kaha ki unki sargical strike ke safal hone ke unke paas saboot hai or in sabooton kaa khulaasa karne kaa faisla sarkaar karegi
 Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni believes that Kevon Cooper's 28-run innings of Trinidad and Tobago was the reason for his team's defeat
 trinidad or tobago ne 15 over main 74 ran banaae, lekin aakhri paanch overon main shandaar ballebaaji ke kaaran aath wicket par 123 ran bana liye
 Chennai lost 12 runs in this match 
 dhoni ne kaha,mujhe laga tha ki hamen 110 ran kaa lakshya milegaa

 He said that the wicket was so difficult that the strokes were not being played
 unhone kaha, strike rotate karnaa mushkil tha

 Kalaburgi received the Kannada Sahitya Akademi Award in 2006 for his essay collection Marg-4

 It was allegedly described as a handiwork of Hindu fundamentalist organizations

 But the intellectual society was in anguish and fury from this murder, while some radical organizations allegedly belonging to the Sangh Parivar threatened the writers

 This dissatisfaction took public prominence when a man named Mohammad Akhlaq was murdered in Dadri near the capital Delhi on 28 September simply because of rumors of beef being planted in his house
 bauddhik samaaj ne ise badhati dakshinpanthi ashishnutaa kaa nateeja mana
 All political groups called Akhlaq's killing barbaric, but right-wing leaders and organizations appeared to support the killers and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who tweeted almost every topic in the world, did not react to any of these matters at that time

 The statement of the Akademi president and Hindi litterateur Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari provoked him rather than pacifying him
 unhone kaha, “ haalanki vartmaan main jo ghatnaayen ghati hai usase bhayanak ghatnaayen bhi ateet main ho chuki hai, lekin aisa kabhi nahin kiya gaya
 "he refers to the 1984 riots of Emergency

 Sahitya Akademi in the circle of questions, however, the pain of writers returning the award is that so much is happening in the society, Sahitya Akademi is silent about it
 kuch lekhak is khamoshi ko khatarnaak maanate hai to kuch kehete hai ki isse academy kaa bhavishya andhkaar main bhi ja saktaa he
 Senior critic Vishwanath Tripathi believes that if the president of Sahitya Akademi had condemned the attacks on independent thinkers and writers, it would not have happened
 ve kehete hai, “ab bhi halaat bigade nahin hai
 ”tripathi also states that he had gone to meet Tiwari, president of Sahitya Akademi, along with some of his colleagues about 15 days ago
 ve kehete hai, “hamane unase kaha tha ki aap kinhin karanvash hatyaron kii ninda nahin kar sakate, to koi baat nahin
 Give us an auditorium, we will do it
 lekin aashwaasan ke baavjood unhone is baat ko puraa nahin kiya
 "the attitude of senior narrator Giriraj Kishore (two and a half houses, novel, awarded the Sahitya Akademi in 1992), against Mahatma Gandhi's overseas auction of material, offered to return his Padma Shri award to the President, is quite different
 ve maanate hai ki sahitya academy swaitshasi sanstha he, jise is sabase nuksaan pahonchega
 He says, "we should not ruin institutions
 sarkaar ko isse acha mauka mil jayega or vah film and televijan institute of india (apatiai) or neshnal book trust (enbiti) kii tarah yahaan bhi apane log laakar baitha degi
 "but for now, the awarding writers do not care
 2012 kaa sahitya academy yuva puraskaar paane vaale aman sethi ne apane patr main likhaa he, “jitani jarurat hamen sahitya academy kii he usase zyada jarurat is tarah ke sansthaanon ko lekhak or patrakaron kii he
 We are lucky that our first loyalty is to our readers
 ham pathakon ke prati javabdeh hai, na ki sarkari santhaan ke prati
 "by the way, it is not easy for anyone to return the award and this is also proved by the case of 80-year-old Punjabi narrator Dalip Kaur Tiwana
 unhone padmashri sammaan lautaane kii ghoshnaa kii he jise ve apane dil ke kaaphi kareeb maanati hai
 She says, "I am not only against religious intolerance but also oppose the thinking of the current government that it can do everything because it is in power

 Similarly, Asghar Wajahat believes that it is not wrong to protest but this method is not right

 On the murder of Akhlaq, journalist Tavleen Singh tweeted, "why are Modi's ministers calling Dadri incident as" unfortunate "? Why not barbaric, frightening or embarrassing? " It is worth noting that the Prime Minister himself, while calling it "unfortunate", also asked the question, how is the Center responsible for this? Film actor Anupam Kher considers it "politically motivated" to embarrass the Prime Minister
 unka kahana he, “jab tasalima nasrin ke saath bura bartaav kiya gaya to kisi ne puraskaar nahin lautaaya

 We also saw Shahid and Meera's onscreen chemistry in Karan Johar's show
 donon jis tarah khulkar baat kar rahe the, usase lag rahaa tha ki ve ek-duusare ko bahut acchhee tarah samaj chuke hai
 Taking care of each other: During the show, Meera Rajput recognized that Shahid takes great care of them and hence their relationship becomes even more special

 Both are like friends with each other and talk about their x openly in each other's presence

 When the Mumbai court acquitted BJP President Amit Shah of charges, the CBI was put in the dock
 yahaan samajhnaa jaruri he ki shuru main ye do maamle the, soharabuddin encounter cese or doosraa tulsi ram prajapati cese
 The Supreme Court had merged the two cases, so the evidence which was shown in one case became the basis for moving the case in the other
 soharabuddin maamle main court ne mana ki tulsi ram prajapati kaa bayaan purna rup se sweekaarya nahin he, kyonki tulsi ne kuch logon ko kaha tha, jinhone aage aakar sibiai ke aage bayaan die the ki kis tarah amit shah na sirf farji muthbhed main shaamil the, balki pulisavaalon dwaara ugaahi gai rakam bhi amit shah tak pahunchaai thi
 The court considered that because this testimony is circumstantial that is why it does not matter
 sibiai ne yahi tathy duusare maamle main bhi court ke aage rakhe, lekin duusare maamle main vah yah court ko saaf nahin kar pai ki tulsiram is duusare maamle main peedit tha, yani vah bayaan ab gavaah ke taur par nahin, balki marate vakt die gaye bayaan ke rup main dekha janaa chahie or marate vakt die gaye bayaan ko indian avidence act ke section 32 ke tahat sweekaarya he
 Because both the cases were assembled, the case should have been stronger, but weakened by the negligence of the CBI
 sibiai ne court par yah na kabhi daleel di or na hi kabhi apana rukh saaf kiya
 In fact, the CBI tied up the role in this case only last year, when former CBI Director Ranjit Sinha left it to the court to take a decision on the evidence of the CBI
 nateeja sibiai ne apni daleel court ke aage kabhi rakhi nahin
 Now CBI is giving clarification
 sibiai ke nae adhyaksh anil sinha ne enditivi ko bataaya ki vah adaalat ke faisle kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Whether or not the verdict will be appealed in the next court will be decided only after reading the court order
 yani yah tay maan liya jaae ki ab sibiai ke haathon main bhi bediyaan pad gai hai isiilie ab is maamle main zyada kuch hone vaala nahin he

 He said, 'there has been no initiative from their side, so we cannot say about it right now

 team india ek baar phir se vishwa cap ke semifinal main harkar toornament se baahar ho gai he
 Earlier last year, in the one-day World Cup, the team lost in the semi-final against Australia
 tab vishwa cap ke baad saurav ganguli, sachin tendulkar or vivies lakshmana vaali salaahkaar samiti ko coach ke naam par muhar lagane kii jimmedaari saunpi gai thi, lekin kaaphi atakalon ke baad, ravi shastri kaa qaraar bataur team nideshak 2016 tii-20 vishwa cap tak badha diya gaya
 The team players also advocated Ravi Shastri to stay with the team, with Virat Kohli leading the way
 lekin, is baar bisisiai sachiv anuraag thakur ne apana paksh saaf kar diya he ki ab team india ko nideshak nahin balki ek ful time coach chahie
 Anurag Thakur said that Ravi Shastri's agreement was till the T20 World Cup and suggestions have been sought from the Advisory Committee for the name of the new coach and it will be decided after April 3
 tippaniyan According to Anurag Thakur, a new appointment or renewal of the agreement will be decided after the World Cup final and it can be taken even before the IPL starting on 9 April
 lekin, anuraag thakur ne ye bhi saaf kiya ki ravi shastri ke qaraar kaa navinikaran bhi ho saktaa he agar salaahkaar samiti aisa maanati he to, lekin is baar hamen purnakalik coach chahie or koi do pad nahin honge jaisaa ki dancan flechar ke samay tha
 a coach and a team director
 is baar ek hi pad hoga or us pad ke liye naamon kaa chayan karne ke liye salaahkaar samiti ko bol diya gaya he
 The last time this happened was after the 2015 ODI World Cup, but Ravi Shastri was not completely ready for the post of coach
 isliye tii-20 vishwa cap tak unka qaraar hua
 If you consider that as the basis, then this time also it is very difficult that Ravi Shastri will be ready to enter into a 2-3-year agreement with the BCCI as a coach
 aise main mana yahi ja rahaa he ki team india ko ab nayaa coach milane ja rahaa he

 Meanwhile, a statement of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on social media became very viral
 kya he daavacangress party ke netaaon main matbhed kii khabaron ke bich soshal media par manmohan singh ke naam par ek bayaan hindi main viral hua
 This statement claimed that Manmohan Singh said in his statement that "whether we are in power or in the opposition, it does not matter
 hamen desh kii chintaa he
 We know people are celebrating when Article 370 is over
 hamen us vakt bhi pataa tha jab notebandi or jiesti par log jashn manaa rahe the, lekin phir bhi hamane uskaa virodh kiya

 And we accept the sacrifice of the party but the loss of the country is not acceptable

 But no statement has been issued in the name of Manmohan Singh personally
 viral ho rahaa massej kaalpanik or galat he
 Many people came in the bluff, many people came in the bluff of this viral statement
 jaise hindi ke janemaane kavi pawan karan ne bhi isefesbukapar share kiya
 Similarly, Mohammad Kalim and many other users like him also believed in it and shared it on Facebook
 yah massej twitor par bhi viral hua
 a decision was passed in the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on 6 August 2019 after the decision on Jammu and Kashmir in Fact Check Parliament
 is prastaav main anuchhed 370 hataane ko lekar sarkaar ke faisle ko 'ekatarfa, sharmnaak or aloktantric' kaha gaya
 The resolution also stated that "the Indian National Congress stands with the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh in fighting the divisive and malicious agenda of the BJP
" " is meeting main manmohan singh bhi maujuud the
 a report was also published in the media about the meeting of the Congress Working Committee, which can be seen
 hamane manmohan singh ke daftar main bhi sampark kiya
 He completely denied that 'is completely imaginary and wrong
 ' unkeophis ne yah bhi spasht kiya ki manmohan singh kaa koi nijee soshal media acount nahin he
 Conclusion In the Congress Working Committee's proposal and in any media report, we did not find any such public statement of Manmohan Singh regarding the developments on Jammu and Kashmir
 unke aphis ne bhi ise 'kaalpanik or galat' kaha
 However, we do not know what Manmohan Singh said to the leaders of the Congress Working Committee meeting
 lekin party dwaara jari bayaan or media reports ke aadhaar par yahi nishkarsh nikalataa he ki viral ho rahaa bayaan gumraah karne vaala he, kyonki is bayaan main istemaal kiye gaye shabd manmohan singh ke nahin hai

 During the election season, Congress has started knocking lotus blooms in the ponds of Madhya Pradesh
 pradesh congress ne chunaav ayog se maang kii he ki talabon main khile saare camel ke phool dhak die jaaen, taaki log anuchit tareeke se bijepi kii ore aakarshith na ho saken
 The Congress is particularly troubled by the lotus flowers blooming in Mahakaushal, Malwa and Bundelkhand
 congress kaa maananaa he ki in talabon ko dhanke jane ke baad hi donon partiyon ko barabari kaa mauka milegaa
 Elephant statues were covered in UP It is said that during the last assembly elections, the Election Commission had covered the statues of BSP election symbol in Lucknow
 madhya pradesh bijepi ke pravaktaa vishwaas saarang ne palatwaar karte hue kaha he ki yah congress ke 'maansik divaaliepan or niraashaa' kaa pratik he
 He said, 'this means that people will start covering their hands too, because that too is the mark of a party
 'congress kaa daawa, 40 siton par padegaa asarcongress kii is ajeebogareeb maang se jabalpur ke nirvachan adhikari rajesh jain sakate main hai
 He said that he is not authorized to take a decision on the matter
 vah apane senior adhikariyon se is par baat karenge
 Congress President Amar Chand Bawadia has argued that when elephant statues could have an impact on the UP elections, why not lotus flowers? He said, 'there are 40 assembly constituencies in Madhya Pradesh where lotus cultivation is done on a large scale
 ham nahin chaahate ki camel kii fasal logon ko bijepi ke bare main sochane ke liye prerit kare
 'complaint was also made on the lotus book in 2008
 Another local leader Manmohan Aggarwal said that the district election officer of Dhar has assured that he will cover the lotus pond adjacent to the polling booth of Manawad assembly constituency during the election
 unhone kaha ki vah puure pradesh main aisa hi chaahate hai

 dilli ke rouj avenue court ne agasta westland mani londring maamle main ratul puri ke khilaaf gaiyr jamaanti warrant (NBW) jari kar diya he
 In fact, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) demanded the court to issue a non-bailable warrant against Ratul Puri after Ratul Puri did not reach for questioning
 vahiin unki agrim jamaanat ko bhi sibiai kii vishesh adaalat khaarij kar chuki he
 Ratul Puri is the nephew of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath

 puri apni companiyon ke madhyam se agasta westland saude main kathith taur par rishwat praapt karne ke aarope main jaanch agenciyon kii jaanch ke daayre main hai
 The ED has alleged that accounts linked to firms owned and operated by Puri were used to obtain money related to bribes and money laundering in the agustawestland deal for VIP helicopters
 isse pehle, sibiai kii ek vishesh adaalat ne mangalvaar ko ratul puri kii agrim jamaanat yachika khaarij kar di thi
 Special CBI Judge Arvind Kumar also rejected Puri's application in which he had sought a copy of his own statements recorded under Section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA)
 bataa den ki puri dilli hoicourt main daayar apni yachika ko waapas le liya tha, jisamen unhone nyaayalay se maang kii thi ki vah jamaanat yachika par aadesh paarit karne se pehle trial court ko nirdesh paarit kare

 niyamon ke mutabik jin raajnneetik dalon ne aam chunaav main hissaa liya he, unhen 90 din ke andar chunaav ayog ko kharch kaa byoraa saunpna hota he
 If they do not do so, they lose their election symbol and recognition

 Mahakal could not survive the continuous rains in Ujjain
 pichley teen dinon se ho rahi barish ke kaaran pani 12 jyotirlingon main se ek bhootbhavan baba mahakaleshwar ke garbhagrih main bhi pahunch gaya
 The pandas and priests worshiped Mahakal, immersed in water
 ujjain main prasiddh mahakaal kaa mandir he jiske darshan ko har saal desh-videsh se log aate hai

 The challenge for India will be India have won both their practice matches against the second-tier Western Australia team, one in T20 and the other in odis
 mehmaan team ko haalanki steven smith kii team ke khilaaf isse kahin adhik kadi chunauti milegi
 2015 has not been very good for India
 team ne bangladesh ke khilaaf uske maidan par jabaki dakshin africa ke khilaaf apni sarajameen par ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa ganvaai
 For Dhoni, the negative-positive captain Dhoni will try to reverse the dice in the new year but he will feel that star fast bowler Mohammed Shami has been ruled out of the tour due to a hamstring strain without throwing a single ball
 dhoni ke liye haalanki kuch raahat kii baat ho sakati he
 David Warner may not be available for the bulk of the series
 iske alaava mishael stark chotil hai jabaki mishael janson sanyas le chuke hai
 Australia's bowling attack included Josh Hazlewood, Joel Paris, Scott Boland and Jimmy Faulkner seem somewhat inferior in terms of experience
 gendbaaji akraman kaa sangyojan dhoni ke liye sabase mahatvapurn hoga
 Ishant Sharma, the team's most experienced bowler, did not bowl in two practice matches and it is not known whether he will play in the first match
 ye khilaadi ho sakate hai team kaa hissaaustralia kii sabase adhik oochaal vaali vaaka kii pich par teen gendbaajon kaa khelnaa lagbhag tay he or aise main baayen haath ke tej gendbaaj barinder saran ko padaarpan kaa mauka tay he jabaki ishanth or umesh yadav unke saathi tej gendbaaj ho sakate hai
 Two experienced spin all-rounders Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja may be the other members of the bowling attack
 bhartiya ballebaaji kram lagbhag tay najar aata he jisamen rohit sharma or shikhar dhawan pari kii shuruuaat karne kii jimmedaari sanbhaalenge jabaki tisare number par viraat kohli aaenge
 Ajinkya Rahane is expected to land at number four and the Indian captain can bat at number five once again
 chathe number par nayaa cheharaa dikh saktaa he
 Manish Pandey or Gurkeerat Singh can be fielded at this place due to the exclusion of Suresh Raina from the team

 Gurkeerat has also been consistently doing well in domestic cricket for Punjab and India A
 iske alaava tej gendbaaji alrounder rishi dhawan or bhavuneshwar kumaar ke rup main bhi vikalp maujuud hai
 The next few months will be very important for Dhoni as he has been appointed as the captain till the World T20

 It will be interesting to see which order Dhoni bats at
 bharat ke ye hogi chunautismith kii aguai main agar australia kaa ballebaaji kram lay main aa gaya to phir bhartiya gendbaajon ke liye unhen ran banane se rokna aasaan nahin hoga
 Whenever Warner is available, he will be a threat to the bowlers
 aaron finch or glen maxwell bhi gendbaaji ko dhwast karne kii kshamta rakhte hai
 Former captain George Bailey is a very capable player in this format and he will have the responsibility of grooming the innings in an adverse situation

 mahadev yani devon ke dev mahadev is sristi par sabase shaktishaalee or balashaali maane jate hai
 According to Hindu belief, Shiva is the destroyer, Brahma is the creator and Vishnu is the protector
 lekin phir bhi hindu dharm main bhagwaan shiv ko sabase bada sthaan praapt he
 By the way, you know that the existence of Bholenath is due to Vishnu and Brahma on this earth
 chaliye aaj aapako bataate hai bhagwaan shiv ke janm kii katha-aisa kaha jaataa he ki mahadev kii koi maa nahin thi, arthath unka janm maa ke pet se nahin hua
 Rather they had descended on this earth
 ek baar donon vishnu or brahma main is baat par bahes chhid gai ki koun un donon main se zyada shreshth he
 In the midst of this debate, a mysterious column suddenly appeared and it was so tall that neither its top was visible nor the bottom
 ye dekh donon vishnu or brahma achraj main pad gaye
 He wondered if there is any third super power on this earth which is more powerful than him
 tab donon ne nirnay kiya wo is rahasyamay stambh kaa raaj samajhakar rahenge
 Then Brahma Ji transformed himself into a duck, while Vishnu took the form of a boar
 ab brahma gaye aasmaan kii taraf or vishnu gaye pataal kii taraf
 The goal of both was the same that somehow the secret of this pillar should be understood
 ab kaaphi varsh biit gaye lekin donon main se koi bhi us stambh ke aakhri chor tak nahin pahunch paaya
 When both of them failed and came back to their place, they saw that Lord Shiva was appearing from that pillar
 vaise bataa den, wo stambh bhi bholenath kaa ek rup tha
 Seeing this formidable form of Lord Shiva, both Vishnu and Brahma understood that the power of Shiva is greater than both of them and they are the most powerful beings of this creation
 kaha jaataa he yahi wo pal tha jab mahadev pehali baar dharti par avatarit hue

 It seems that Aamir Khan is in a mood to tease his actor friend Salman Khan
 aamir apni nai film 'pike' ke ek poster main patalun bina najar aa rahe hai or vah yah jaanane ko utsuk hai ki salmaan unke is andaaj ko bhi pramot karenge yaa nahin? jaahir he ki jab aamir kii 'dhooma 3' film ai thi to unki topi bahut mashhoor hui thi
 At that time, Salman was seen wearing an 'aamir Topi' in his popular television reality show 'bigg Boss' to promote it
 kapade utaar kar maine salmaan khan kaa kaam kiya he: aamir khanis bare main aamir ne mazaakia lahaze main kaha, 'film 'dhooma 3' ke dauraan meri topi bahut mashhoor hui thi or salmaan 'big bos' main ise pahan rahe the, isliye ab main unki dosti kaa imtihaan lenaa chahta hum
 So let's see if he can do this
 vah apni kameez utaar chuke hai, kya ab apni pant utaar sakate hai?'sallu bhaijan sir par savaar hai kyonki ham sab salmaan khan hai

 jokes banane shuru nahin hue to kya hua
 Salman bhai's films from today are starproof
 salmaan khan ke dost or 'susu partner' aamir khan ne kuch maheene pehle 'agenda aaj tak' main sahi hi kaha tha
 Where are we all stars
 star to ek hi he
 Salman Khan
 wo chashma ulta laga le
 Shake the towel or tear off the shirt, everything turns into ada
 public lattu ho jaati he
 He does not need any story, no star
 itnaa kaaphi he yaa or bhi disclemur chahie is rivyuu ko padhane se pehle
 The Hindi film 'jai Ho', based on the 2006 Telugu film Stalin, has everything
 ection, romance, dance, kamedi, imoshan, deshbhakti, vichaar, thrill, sher kii dahaad, bahan kii pukaar, bachche kaa pyaar, kamjor kii pukaar, pehle bindaas or phir sharmili nayika kaa izhaar
 So, let's check all these expressions one by one
 ye kahani he jai agnihotri kii, jo fouj main the
 For some reason, what you will know by watching the film, he returned to civilian life from military
 magar deshbhakti ab bhi thuns-kootakar bhari he
 If anything goes wrong, they start correcting it
 is kaam main unke saath hai do changu-mongu, jinamein ek he doctor, doosraa kuch corporate naukari vaala dikhataa he
 There is also a passionate, sensitive and strong sister Geeta
 shankh kii tarah 'jai ho' kii jindagi main kartavya kii gunj paidaa karti
 Geeta has a loving son
 kamedi kii tamaam gunjaaishein paidaa karata
 Yes, so hail, happy
 magar use lagata he ki aasapaas kitna kuch galat ho rahaa he, koi kuch karata kyon nahin
 Then he does the same
 ek mantar detaa he
 Help someone jab wo thankyuu bole, to kaho, thankyuu mat bolie
 Just help three people
 or un teen logon se kahie ki wo bhi kisi teen kii madad karen
 So this 'amway' is a network type chain of goodness that Jai wants to run
 chahta he, se yaad aayaa, ek pinki padosan bhi he, jo jai se pyaar karti he
 The character of the protagonist is fully portrayed only when the villain is also there
 or chunki yahaan salmaan khan hai, isliye khalnaayakon kii fouj chahie
 Barring one, the bad cop, Katkhani the home minister's daughter, the rogue minister, his six-pack son for the climax fight, the rascal son-in-law and some of the district's top ten crime-list goons
 jai apane sankalp, sooyeeboojh or saahas ke dam par in sabhi ko parrast karata he
 Finally, the crowd, which is affectionately called the public, does justice
 log achchhai kii kasame khate hai
 Make chains and make the country great again
 film main ection bahut he or behtareen he
 English movies do not go at the behest of stare-makers
 haftaa kharch kar denge wo ye bataane main ki falana seen 'transporter' siries se liya he or dhikaana 'fast and furious' se
 And swear to God, finally when Salman breaks the shirt and fights, it gets torn
 matlab 20 saal se ye trick kaam kar rahi he
 Is not amazing or is baar to sher kii dahaad bhi he bette
 The film has songs and also dances
 salmaan naachte hai to aam aadmi kaa khyaal rakhte hai
 There are no difficult steps
 matlab gali mohalle ke launde rangeen kaanch ke floor vaale deje par unhen achche se utaar saken
 Are of this type
 yahaan bhi hai
 There are also two Th Love Songs
 nukkad ke rangeen paan bhandar ke deck par bajane ke liye
 And obviously if there is a ringing at the crossroads, then necessary expressions and euphemisms like 'naina, will kill' are made
 kahani main raftaar he
 There are lots of jokes
 chaddhi joke ij veri phani
 You Know
 daiji shah ne bataur heroin vahi kiya he jo salmaan kii film main kiya ja saktaa he
 It was nice to see Tabu on the screen of the mainstream film after a long time
 baaki sab first class he
 Chillar Party fame kid Naman Jain has done good acting again
 'jai ho' achchhai ko prachaarit karti film he
 It hurts the hurt of the common man
 aajkal kii raajnneeti kii tarah
 But there is also some chaos in it
 masalan, aakhir main fouj bhi maidan main aa jaati he
 But there is cinema, that too of Salman Bhai, so all these are minor and less capable things
 jai ho dekhie, agar salmaan khan ke fain hai
 Masala is a fan of films
 paramparaagat hindi cinema ke fain hai

 But many women Naxalites are either engaged in espionage work or they work quietly for the Naxalites by adopting fake identities in rural and urban networks

 purush naksaliyon se bhi khatarnaak mahila cadrankliyon kaa mahila cader beete 5 saalon main 50 se zyada hamalon ko anjaam de chukaa he
 Female Naxalites have also been used to mislead security forces in the jungles, ambush them and loot weapons
 police ke mutabik mahila naksaliyon ne jasuri ke bhi aise record banaae hai jo police afasaron ko hairat main daalane vaale hai
 Female Naxalites play an important role in strengthening the Naxalite network in cities and villages
 inamen se kaiyon ne aspataal main rahakar baqayada nursing course kiye hai taaki ghayal maovadiyon kaa ilaaj kar saken
 However, in the Naxalite organization, many of these women also have to suffer physical abuse

 Provided this plan is also safe

 ek ore jahaan ham life main har jagah mobile diviz kaa istemaal kar rahe hai to ajukeshan system main kyon ham peeche hai yah kahana thaipi uniwarsity, skool of maas communication ke dean professor si pi singh kaa
 Professor CP Singh has recently attended the Adobe Education Leadership Forum in Bali
 jahaan ajukeshan system main technology or mobile ke istemaal par bhi charchaa kii gai
 Here are excerpts from the conversation with him: Do you think that mobile education should be used in the education system in Adobe Education Leadership Forum in Bali? Use of mobile in education system is absolutely essential
 aaj students apane kareeb 10-12 ghante mobile par bitaate hai to unhen samajhane ke liye isse achchhaplatformaur kya ho saktaa he
 When we are using it in social life, then what is the problem with using it in studies
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki class main mobile ke istemaal ke negative prabhaav zyada honge?koi bhi technology jab pehali baar aati he to uske kuch nuksaan to hote hi hai
 Perhaps if the government takes such a decision in the beginning, then it may have to face some negative impact
 lekin dhire-dhire badlaav jarur aayega or students ko isse kaaphi phayda hoga
 What should be the role of a teacher in the education system? In today's time, the teacher's role has remained only a guide
 soochna itani teji se prasaarit hoti he ki students kii-verde ke jariye sabhi jaankaree hasil kar lete hai
 Now the teacher's job is not just to give information but to connect them with that information
 duusare desh ajukeshan system main kitni technology kaa istemaal karte hai unhone is ajukeshan forum main is vishay ko lekar or kya suzav die ?videshon ke ajukeshan system main to kaaphi had tak technology kaa istemaal hota he
 The entire campus is wi-fi there
 students kai nai technology ke jariye padhai karte hai
 But India is still far behind in this matter
 yahaan bhi kai jagah technology kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, lekin wo bahut kam level par he
 Such changes can be seen soon in India
 kul milakar forum main aapkaa anubhav kaisaa rahaa?forum main asia paisefic ke darjan bhar deshon ke 100 se zyada aise logon ne hissaa liya jo apni simaaon main bade badlaav ko anjaam de rahe hai, uske aguva hai
 In which several topics were discussed including Transforming Education for the Future, Connecting Learning
 forum main 78 fisadi bhartiya teachers ne ajukeshan system main mobile ke istemaal ke idia kaa saport kiya
 83 percent of the teachers also believe that digital facility will clear the concept of students even better
 vahiin 27 percent teachers kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar kii nitiyaan mobile technology dene ke liye anukool nahin hai

 Swami was produced before the special court after the expiry of the one-day period

 Donald Trump has taken the initiative to toughen his H1B visa rules, accusing Indian IT companies of snatching jobs for American citizens
 isse pehle mangalvaar ko australia sarkaar ne apane 457 vija (america ke ech1bi kii tarj par diya ja rahaa vija) kaarykram ko band kar diya tha jiske chalate videshon se kaam karne vaale vahaan pahunchate the
 On the lines of both these decisions, Newland has also announced that she is going to toughen the way of getting jobs for people of foreign origin as she too has to follow the policy of Kiwi First
 in sabhi faislon kaa sidhaa asar bharat kii iti companiyon par padegaa
 In Australia, these visas are given to about 60 per cent of Indians every year and 70 per cent of Indians in the US, while in New Zealand, the most immigrants are from India
 jaaniye kyon america, australia or newjiland ko bhartiya iti companiyaan jaise infosis, tisies or wipro se mahasoos ho rahaa he ye dabaav:kya he bhartiya companiyon kaa roledonon america kaa ech1bi vija kaarykram oraustralia kaa 457 vija kaarykramanon-imigrent vija he
 By issuing these visas, companies in the US and Australia call engineers, scientists and computer programmers from abroad to work in their country
 aisa karne ke liye zyaadaatar bhartiya companiyon ko work outsorcing ke jariye ye vija aavantit kiya jaataa he
 Indian companies send this talent workforce for American companies to the US from India on the job
 donald trump kaa bhartiya companiyon par aropatrump kaa aarope he ki bhartiya companiyanech1bi vija niyamonka ulanghan karte hue america nagarikon kii naukariyon par bharatiyon ko bhar rahi hai
 The same charge is being leveled against Indian companies in Australia
 darasal america kaa ech1bi vija kaarykram us sthiti main jari kiya jaataa he ki jab kisi kaam ke liye kisi khaas tallent kii jarurat he or america main us tallent kaa aadmi uplabdh nahin hota
 Now Trump administration believes that Indian IT companies are also calling on such professionals in the US by resorting to this visa, who are being made to work in the US at low cost
 iskaa nateeja ye he ki aise profeshnals america nagarikon kii naukariyon par kabja kar rahe hai
 In New Zealand too, Kiwi First will increase the minimum salary for foreigners, on the lines of Australia and America, New Zealand has also announced that it is going to change its immigration policy to curb the number of immigrants
 newjiland ke imigration mantri maaikel woodhouse ne kaha ki nae imigration niyam lagu hone ke baad australian companiyon ke liye videshi logon ko naukari dena mushkil ho jayega
 On the lines of Trump's America First, Newland has also announced to go for Kiwi First's policies
 newjiland sarkaar vahaan rah rahe apravasiyon kii nunatam selary ko aadhaar lete hue nae niyam laane ja rahi he
 Under these rules, now you can get a job as a skilled labor only if you get at least median salary there
 vahiin hyli skild lebar ke liye median selary kaa 150 fisadi paanaa anivaary ho jayega
 At the same time, under the new rules, the New Zealand government will extend the life of its less skilled immigrants to three years
 kya he america kaa nayaa prastiamerica main trump sarkaar banane ke baad ech1bi vija ke durupyog ko rokane kii pahal kii ja rahi he
 a private member proposal has been brought in the US Congress to increase the minimum rate of minimum salary under H1B visa from $ 60,000 to $ 1,30,000
 yadi is prastaav ko congress se manjuuri mil jaati he to bhartiya companiyon ke liye kadi chunauti khadi ho jaaegi or unhen apni zyaadaatar jaruraton ke liye america naagarik ko naukari deni padegi
 Loss to Indian companies If the campaign of Trump administration on H1B visa is successful, then the profit margin of Indian IT companies working there will be reduced
 abhitak jahaan kisi kaam ko karne ke liye vah kam laagat vaale profeshnals ko bharat se bula lete the, phir unhen yaa to bhartiya karmchaariyon ko adhik selary deni padegi nahin to kaam karaane ke liye kisi america naagarik ko naukari par rakhana padegaa
 Significantly, if the minimum annual salary under the H1B visa in the US is increased to 1 lakh 10 thousand dollars, then TCS gets 2 in profit margin
 30 fisadi kaa nuksaan hone kii sambhaavna he
 At present, TCS gives an average annual salary of about $ 70 thousand to the professionals taking from India on this visa
 vahiin duusari badi company infosis ko nae niyam ke baad profit margin main lagbhag 1
 There will be a loss of 70 percent
 infosis maujuuda samay main lagbhag 80 hajaar dollar ausatan vaarshik selary detii he
 PM Modi's Global Dream Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while defining his global dream, said in his Madison Square speech that the way people from all over the world come to America, the same way people from India go to the whole world
 desh main skill deveopment par jor dete hue modi ne kaha tha ki unki koshish hogi ki puri duniya main bhartiya skill kii jarurat pade jisase maujuuda sadi main bharat puri duniya ke liye workforce prowider ban sake
 But now after the decision of Australia and America, there is a tough challenge in front of this global dream of PM Modi

 However, in Punjab, bets are being placed on the tough competition between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress

 The state government has asked the Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the case, counting 10 flaws in the Central Investigation Agency (NIA) investigation in the letter
 rajya sarkaar ne likhaa he ki is puure maamle kii jaanch ab rajya sarkaar kii esaiti ke dwaara karai jaaegi isliye is cese ko unhen transfar kiya jaae
 In fact, Naxalite attack took place in Jhiram Valley in 2013 in Bastar district of Chhattisgarh
 jisamen congress ke bade netaaon ke saath 27 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 The investigation of the case was handed over to the NIA by the Union Home Ministry on 27 May 2013
 enie ne apni jaanch main 88 naksaliyon ke cader ko sanlipt paaya tha or 24 sitambar 2014 ko chargeshit daakhil kii thi
 But now the state government of Chhattisgarh has raised questions about this investigation by NIA
 esaiti karegi maamle kii jaanchachhattisgarh sarkaar kii ore se grih mantralay ko bheji gai chitthee main kaha gaya he ki is puure maamle main jo enie kii jaanch hui he usamen bade shandyantra ko najrandaaj kiya gaya or enie sahi tareeke se maamle kii jaanch karne main vifal rahi he
 This is the reason why the state government wrote a letter to Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, saying that now the state government will investigate the entire matter by making an SIT
 enie par thik se jaanch naa karne kaa aaroparajya sarkaar ne apni chitthee main kaha ki enie ne apni jaanch main 88 naksaliyon ko is maamle main sanlipt paaya tha
 On 24 September 2014, a charge sheet was filed in this entire case
 isamen 9 logon ke khilaaf chargeshit daakhil kii gai
 After that, on 28 September 2015, supplementary charge sheet was filed against 30 people
 rajya sarkaar ne apane patr main kaha he ki enie ne apni invastigeshan main kisi duusari theory par kaam nahin kiya
 Anticipating the involvement of the big Naxal commanders, the letter written to the Ministry of Home Affairs has also said that many later evidence about Ramanna, Gudsa Usendi, Gajrala Ashok and other Naxalites was found that they too could be involved in this whole attack
 
 lekin iske baavjood bhi inako kisi bhi chargeshit main NIA ne shaamil nahin kiya
 The state government believes that big Naxal commanders may be involved in this attack, so the matter should be investigated by the state government

 ucchtam nyaayalay ne varsh 1977 kii apni us adhisuchana ko lagu nahi karne par bihar sarkaar kii jamkar khinchaai kii jisamen madhyamik skulon ke shikshakon ko anya sarkari karmchaariyon kii bhaanti hi 'pronnati ke avasar' kaa praavdhaan he
 a bench of Justice Surinder Singh Nijjar and Justice HL Gokhale said, “the state government's stand has created unnecessary anxiety among many teachers
 rajya sarkaar ko ahsaas karnaa chahie ki jis desh main itani adhik nirakshartaa he or jahaan badi sankhya main pehali peedi ke chaatr hai, praathmik evam madhyamik shikshakon kii bhoomika bahut mahatvapurn he
 The bench said, "they should be treated with respect and they should be given proper pay scales and promotion opportunities
" nishchit taur par rajya sarkaar se aisi ummid nahin he ki ve ve unhen vashren tak adalati pachade main daalen
 The court made this remark, accepting the request of the Bihar State Government Secondary School Teachers Association
 shikshak sangh yah maang karte hue sheersh adaalat pahunchaa tha ki vah rajya sarkaar ko 35 saal puraani us adhisuchana ko lagu karne kaa nirdesh de jisamen unke cader ko bihar shiksha seva sangh ke dwitiyak grad ke adhikari varg main vilay karne karne kaa praavdhaan he taaki unhen bhi pronnati ke avasar mili
 While writing the judgment, Justice Nijjar objected strongly that the state government changed its stand, delayed the implementation of the notification and made three rounds of litigation from the High Court to the Supreme Court
 nyaayalay ne is baat par bhi nakhushi jataayi ki patna ucch nyaayalay ke ekal nyaayadhish or khandpeeth ne teesri baar mukademe kii naye dhang se sunwaayee kii jabaki ucchtam nyaayalay pehle hi is par faisla suna chukaa tha
 He said, 'we do not expect such an approach from the state government and at least the High Court
 ' sheersh adaalat ne patna ucch nyaayalay kii is baat ke liye bhi khinchaai kii usne is tathy kii upeksha kii ki sheersh adaalat pehle hi is par sunwaayee kar chuki he or maamle ko tay kar chuki he
 The Supreme Court said in the order of 42 pages, "as per the suzerainty of the courts, the High Courts should accept the interpretation of the decisions of this court and the orders issued by it
" isse hatane kaa matlab anushaasanheenata or araajaktaa hogi
 He said, 'high courts cannot ignore Article 141 of the Constitution which clearly states that the laws declared by this court are binding on all courts within India
