 Can you leave a job for your country? Can you leave a family for your country? Can you give up your life for your country? These three questions are historical, which has made one country against 5 countries only 6 Won the day
 in teen sawaalon ke dam par isroyal ne 1967 main hui aitihaasik jang ko shandaar tareeke se jeet liya
 These questions were asked by Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, to his detective Eli Cohen while he was being prepared for a mission
 aisa mishan jisane itihaas rach diya
 What is this story and who is Eli Cohen, who was hanged by Syria in the crossroads in his country in a crime of betrayal
 puri baat yahaan padhie
 
 
 a recent web series has appeared on Netflix called 'the Spy'
 ye kahani eli kohen kii he, jo mosaad kaa ek jasoos tha
 Who spent 5 years of his life as a spy in Syria and helped his country Israel so much that Israel defeated Syria and its allies in just 6 days in the war
 6 episod kii is siries main har episod kareeb ek ghante lanbaa he
 Which shows the pre-1967 israeli-syrian war
 yahaan ham us series kii baat karte hue us kisse ko bhi aapke saamne rakh rahe hai
 In this fight in 1967, Israel was on one side and Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq on the other side
 iske alaava lebanon bhi in deshon ke saath tha
 Who was Eli Cohen? Mossad, the most dangerous intelligence agency in the world, who does not leave his enemy to any length and fulfills his mission
 1960 ke dashak main jab syria kii ore se isroyal par hamalaa kiya jane laga, to mosaad ne ek jasoos kii talash shuru kii jo syria main rahakar kuch jaankaree juta sake
 In this episode, Eli Cohen comes out
 jo paidaa mistra main hue, pita yahudee the or maa syrian
 After Egypt reached Argentina and then Israel
 pita ne isroyal main rukne kaa faisla liya, lekin eli kohen apni padhai ke liye mistra main ruke
 First completed studies, then later a course in espionage
 jab mosaad ne shuru kiya apana mishneli kohen 1960 main israeli khufia vibhaag se jude or kaam shuru kiya
 a year later, he started to train for spying in Syria and was somehow transported to Syria
 kamil amin thabet jo ek export kaa kaam karata tha, usne syria ke damishq main apana bijness shuru kiya
 Damascus was the capital, so power was here
 paison kaa istemaal kar kamil amin thabet urf eli kohen bade logon kii najar main aana shuru ho gaye
 After which he increased relations with officers in the army, befriended the general's nephew
 usee kii madad se border tak pahunche, aise sthanon par pahunche jahaan se syria isroyal ke khilaaf sajeesh rachataa tha
 Four years of espionage gave Israel a victory
 From 1961 to 1965, Eli Cohen, living in Damascus, Syria, gave the smallest details to Israel's Mossad
 jisamen syria ke paas kya hathiyaar hai, wo kab kitne javaanon ko kahaan par tainaat kar rahaa he
 Even as to which route is being used for infiltration, the idea of planting Eucalyptus trees on the Golden Heights between Israel and Syria, which Israel had conquered, was given to Syria by Eli Cohen
 in pedo ke lagane ke baad se hi isroyal ko hint mila ki aakhir syrian jawan border par kahaan tainaat hai or kab hamalaa karne se phayda hoga
 How they were caught and then hanged in the middle of the 1965 phase when Syria was constantly being jolted by shock, because Eli Cohen had conveyed a lot of intelligence to Israel
 lekin lagaataar transmishan se baat karne kii vajah se syria ke general ke chif of staff ko eli kohem par shaq hua, shahar main jab transmishan kii jaanch shuru hui to eli kohen dhare gaye
 That too when he was being given the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense in the Syrian government
 eli kohen ko 1966 main damishq main ek chauraahey par faansee di gai thi
 a banner was placed around his neck, which was written on behalf of the Arabic people present in Syria
 ’ isroyal kii ore se unka shav waapas laane kii kai koshishen kii gayi, lekin syria ne eli kohen kaa shav nahin lautaaya
 More recently last year, Israeli intelligence agency Mossad discovered Eli Cohen's watch which he wore in Syria

 Respected Prime Minister, Mr
 Manmohan Singh, first of all, let me make it clear without being rude that this honorable word that has been added before your name and post has been added due to your old age, humility and constitutional dignity of this post
 behatar to hota ki main is desh kaa aam aadmi likhata, mere pyaare piem ji
 But sorry
 pyaar kahin se bhi nahin aa rahaa
 And today, after listening to your speech more or less farewell, the anger has increased even more
 singh sahab, ye bolta hua desh he or pichley kuch barason main to isaki bechaini itani bad gai he ki bol shor main badal gaye hai
 When the expenses of the vegetable increased every week, we started buzzing in the market
 jab petrol pump kii line main lage, to meter dekhakar laga apni sugar report dekh rahe hon jaise
 On the issue of rape, we took to the streets, then the government welcomed us with sticks and water splashes
 magar ham bole, lagaataar bole or aapse desh kaa sanvaidhanik mukhiya hone ke naate ye ummid kii ki aap bhi bolenge
 Will answer our smoldering questions
 magar nahin, aap zyaadaatar vakt tak chuppi saadhe rahe or jab is par sawaal poocha gaya
 So you said, yes i speak
 magar party ke forum par
 Prime Minister, you are the head of this country, not the Congress party
 to behatar hota ki desh aapako sunata, ek khaas parivaar yaa party ke chuninda pratinidhi nahin
 BJP leader and former finance minister Yashwant Sinha said about you, a joke is now repeated in the country, Manmohan Singh is an over-rated economist and under-rated politician
 mujhe afsos he ki aap aapaki raajnneetik samaj bahut kachi dikhi
 When you were asked questions on coal allocation and 2G spectrum scams, your answer was, all this happened in UPA 1 and after that the public showed confidence in us
 to kya aap kah rahe hai ki in ghotolon yaa gadabadiyon par janadesh kii muhar lag gai
 Everything justified
 kya bahumat milanaa hi sab kuch safed karne kii shart he
 Then you should not have even questioned Narendra Modi in today's speech
 kyonki vah bhi to 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke baad teen baar janadesh hasil kar chuke hai
 What a big contradiction in your arguments! Do you think that the media, the CAG and the opposition have taken a ruthless and irrational attitude in your evaluation? aapako lagata he ki itihaaskaar zyada dayalupurn dhang se aapkaa moolyankan karenge
 i am proud to say that you are mistaken
 ham is desh ke yuva kabhi twitor, kabhi fasebuk, kabhi blog to kabhi ballat ke jariye apni bechaini jaahir karnaa sikh rahe hai
 We will write the history of this country and it will be written with utter impunity that when the country was in the most decisive time of the 21st century, you surrendered in silence to the religion of the alliance and sometimes to the heart of the Gandhi family
 manmohan ji, itihaas dayaalu nahin nirmam hota he or ye baat aap bhi jaanate hai
 Just remember the history of PV Narasimha Rao, who made you shine on the national plank and your party's relationship with him
 bahut mumkin he ki 2014 ke chunaavon main congress ke gud-gobar hone par un nateezon ke liye aapaki sarkaar ko hi jimmedaar tehraaya jaae
 Where there was talk of speaking outright, like the allegations against Virbhadra Singh, you flatly replied that i have not got time to focus on Jaitley's letter
 to mujhe ummid he ki bahut jald aapako vakt hi vakt milegaa
 Today your vigil is on encircling Narendra Modi, which is also right from the party line
 magar desh aapse modi ke alaava or bhi muddon par aisi hi satark magar sateek tippanee chahta tha
 At a press conference, sometimes you said that the best that could have happened due to coalition compulsions, i did
 kabhi bole ki hamane gathbandhan kii sarkaar chalaakar dikhaa di
 So make sure that the alliance has benefited from the loss
 professor rahe hai aap, jaanate hai ki gol-mol baat se kitna khijhate hai ham yuva student
 There are many things, but you are less talkative, so we are also telling our problems in a few words
 bataur pradhanmantri sambhavat: apni aakhri press conference main aap kuch sach kehete or sweekaar karte to acha lagata
 a common man wishes you good health andhra pradesh congress samiti ke adhyaksh bi
 Satyanarayana has said that after taking the people of all regions of the state into confidence, the UPA government at the center will soon find a permanent solution to the Telangana issue

 (input bhashaa se) (from input language) gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke liye voting kii taarikh jaise-jaise najadik aa rahi he vaise vaise congress ko jhatka lag rahaa he
 Hardik Patel was the first of the young trio of Gujarat and now Jignesh Mevani has given the Congress a go
 dalit netaa jignesh mewaani ne congress sahit kisi bhi dal se haath milaane se saaf inkaar kar diya he
 He said that he will not join any party in these elections
 mewaani kaa ye bayaan congress ke liye bada jhatka he kyonki party hardik-mewaani or alpesh thakor ke sahare hi gujarat kii jang fatah karne kaa sapana sanjoe thi
 Significantly, Alpesh has duly taken membership of Congress
 gujarat main satta kaa vanvaas todane ke liye rahul gandhi ne morcha sambhala he
 Rahul Gandhi played a big bet before the election dates were announced
 congress ne bijepi ke khilaaf milakar chunaav ladane ke liye obisi netaa alpesh thakor, patidaar netaa hardik patel or dalit netaa jignesh mewaani ko saath aane kaa nyotaa diya
 Accepting this invitation, Alpesh Thakor first joined the Congress
 gujarat ke yuva tikdi main se hardik patel kaa rukh ab tak saaf nahin he
 Recently he met with NCP leaders
 kuch din pehle tak lag rahaa tha ki hardik congress ke saath jaaenge, lekin ain vakt par unhone congress ko ultimatum de diya
 He granted the Congress first till November 3 in the matter of giving quota to the Patidar society
 ab ye taarikh 7 november tak badha di he
 The Congress is still silent on this
 hardik ke asamanjas ke bich ab gujarat main dalit cheharaa jignesh mewaani ne congress ko samarthan dene se saaf inkaar kar diya he
 At one time, the Congress had opened all its horses to join Jignesh
 pichley dinon jignesh mewaani dilli main the, mana ja rahaa tha ki wo rahul gandhi se mulaakaat karke congress kaa daaman tham lenge, lekin unhone mulaakaat nahin kii
 Now today he has completely cleared his position
 dalit andolan se mili pahachhanjignesh mewaani tab achaanak surkhiyon main aae the jab unhone verawal main oona vaali ghatana ke baad'aazaadee kooch andolan' main 20 hajaar dalitonko ek saath mare jaanavar na uthaane or mailaa na dhone kii shapath dilaai thi
 Jignesh had said at that time- 'in this campaign, we are going to every city, street and village and swear to the people of Bahujan society that they should give up their occupation based on their old varna system and be educated by following the path of Babasaheb Ambedkar Be and stand on your feet '
 jignesh kii siyaasi takatjignesh ke shaamil na hone se congress ko bada jhatka mana ja rahaa he, gujarat main kareeb 7 fisadi dalit matadaata hai or desh main daliton kii sankhya 15 pratishat he
 Apart from this, tribal voters in Gujarat are 12 percent
 jignesh ne rajya ke dalit or adivaasiyon ko ekajute karne kaa kaam kiya tha
 Jignesh Mevani is young and fast-paced
 jignesh sirf gujarat main nahin balki desh main bhi dalit maton ko congress ke paale main waapas laane main ahm bhoomika adaa kar sakate the
 In the current era, the Congress is struggling with a shortage of Dalit youth faces
 aise main oona andolan ke jariye pahchaan banane vaale jignesh se congress ne ummide paal rakhi thi
 But Jignesh has denied all the wishes of the Congress by refusing

 "he said," There will be only two routes to Jammu and Kashmir
 
 Peace and development, and whoever comes in the midst of it, will be dealt with vigorously
 unke liye bharat main kai jail hai
 The BJP leader was addressing a conference of the party's youth unit at Tagore Hall here, which was the first political event since the abolition of the provisions of Article 370 and dividing the state into two union territories
 unhone netaaon se kaha ki jammu-kashmir ke logon kaa apane raajnneetik laabh ke liye istemaal na karen
 Madhav, who visited the valley for the first time after the abolition of the provisions of Article 370, said that if 200 to 300 people have to be kept in jail for achieving peace and development, then we will keep them
 'unhone kaha, 'aap shanti bhang kiye bina bhi apni raajnneeti kar sakate hai
 Some leaders are sending a message sitting in jail that people will take martyrdom by taking up guns
 main un netaaon se kahana chahta hum ki pehle swayan aage aakar shahadat den
 'he said,' Here the leaders were using the common people for their politics and the common people were being used
 ab ham is tarah kii raajnneeti nahin hone denge
 We want the politics of development and corruption will be completely eradicated from here

 They are lions of paper and i know how much courage they have

 Taking a dig at Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, Madhav said that he does not know how to handle his country but he often talks about Kashmir

 He does not know how to handle his country and has narrowly avoided FATF sanctions

 He said, "when there is peace, tourism will increase here
" main sabhi jagah logon se kahata hum ki yadi aapako chuttee manaane ke liye janaa he to kashmir jaaiye
 The entire country is ready to embrace Kashmir and the people of Jammu and Kashmir only have to decide to welcome them and maintain peace here

 Suddenly Congress MLA Asif Mohammed came running to the Speaker's chair and picked up the papers lying there and tore off, lekin josh abhi baaki tha
 Now he ran and went to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, when he saw Mike there, he broke it too
 congress ke adhyaksh arvinder singh lavali or vidhayak hasan ahamed donon spikar kii kursi paas gaye gaye or naare lagane lage
 As soon as the speaker wanted to say something, both of them would pull their mic
 congress ke vidhayak jaykishan ne mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ko adarak de daali, bijepi ke vidhayak arapy singh ne kanoonmantri somnath bharti ko chudiyaan deen
 As far as i remember, this was probably the first time that this assembly was not being held
 congress or bijepi donon kii taraf se kaha ja rahaa tha ki ham 40 hai
 40 means BJP 32 and Congress 8 and the speaker will have to listen to us
 maang thi somnath bharti ke mudde par ''kol atension moshan" laayaa jaae
 Somnath Bharti should be dismissed
 baahar nikalakar congress ke adhyaksh arvinder singh lavali ne kaha ki hamane apane vidhayakon ke vyavhaar par maafi maang lee he
 Congress MLA Asif Mohammad, who was the "superstar" of today's uproar, said, because the speaker was not listening to him, he did so and there was no way for him
 lekin, wo ye kehane se nahin chuke ki ham kal hangaamaa jari rakhenge
 The whole story so far does not match the headline, is it? ye kahani isliye sunai kyonki aisa lag rahaa he ki congress kii ye ranneeti he ki hangaamaa karo or somnath bharti kaa mudda uthaao And try to avoid the religious crisis standing on the Jan Lokpal bill
 bijepi ko to ye niti vaise bhi raas aani hi he, isliye wo is mudde par congress ke saath dikhne main koi dikkat nahin maan rahi Now the question is, what will happen on Friday i
e
 Valentine's Day? aravind kejariwal kii manshaa he wo janalokapal ko vidhaan sabha main pesh kar den, lekin bill ko patal par rakhane se pehle hi agar sarkaar ko roak diya gaya to? That is, if there is a message from the Lt
 Governor that prevents the bill from being table? In such a case, the Chief Minister will go ahead to introduce the bill and what will happen if voting is done to introduce the bill? aisi surat main imtihaan congress or bijepi kaa hoga kyunki agar bill hi pesh na hua to charchaa kya hogi? or jab charchaa hi nahin hogi to paas kisko karenge? In such a case, Arvind Kejriwal can resign on Friday and Delhi's government will fall
 imtihaan yahan aam aadmi party kii sarkaar kaa nahin balki congress-bijepi kaa he
 Because this government has not been formed or jin kaarnon se ye sarkaar banavaai gai wo kaaran shaayad abhi puure nahin hue hai
 In such a way, can both Congress and BJP make the fall of Kejriwal government? Can BJP afford to free Arvind Kejriwal from Delhi? Can Congress go against the Kejriwal government and show up with its evergreen anti-bjp? And will both be ready for Kejriwal's attack that his government was toppled to bring a strict law to curb corruption? isliye maine kaha ki kya vailemtine de par kejariwal istipha de denge, congress-bijepi kaa he imtihaan chaliye shuukravaar ko pataa chalegaa ki kejariwal loksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke liye free ho jaaenge yaa phir dilli ke mukhyamantri ke taur par party kaa agenda aage badhayenge

 unhone likhaa he- bharat main kalege or skool ke str par lakhon asthaayee shikshakon kii yahi haalat he
 Meenakshi Lekhi is not alone responsible for this, they are all who run the government and make policies
 minakshi ji ko jaraa bhi yah pataa hota ki bharat main bhi yahi system kai saal se he or shikshakon kii haalat badtar he to ve saham jaatin
 Mahimaandan is a frad program on Teachers' Day in India
 puure saal shikshak kaa khun chusaa jaataa he, use asuraksha ke saath jeena padataa he, ek din ham unke liye card banaakar khush ho lete hai ki bada sammaan kar liya
 The leader gives moral education that the teacher is the creator of the society
 bholi janata murkh banakar kush ho leti he ki vaah kya baat kahi he netaa ji ne
 Education would have seen the condition of friends at least
 bied karke bhi shikshak berozegaar he or garib he
 Read- Prime Time Intro: Is earning from oil at public price? 2014 ke teachers de kaa zikr karte hue raveesh likhte hai- kitna tamaasha hua tha 2014 ke saal main shikshak diwas par
 There was a discussion on that spectacle happening for the first time for hours
 yahi data de dijie ki aapaki sarkaar main collejon main kitne shikshaton kii purnakalik niyuktiyaan hui he? kitne pad khaali hai or kitne bhare jane hai? bharat ke skulon main kai lakh pad khaali hai
 We also mentioned this in prime time
 bharat kii saansad amareeki kalejon ke asthaayee shikshakon kii durdasha par dukhi hai
 It's a good thing
 kya unhen pataa he ki unki hi party kii sarkaar jahaan jahaan hai vahaan asthaayee shikshakon kii aarthik sthiti kisi he? unke virdohi dalon kii sarkarein jahaan bachi hai, vahaan bhi yahi halaat he
 During the Punjab elections, temporary teachers were found, half the salary was received, there was no social security, we were saying that we do not even have good clothes to go to weddings
 isliye nahin jate hai
 Colleges do not even have the money to drink tea, have been teaching for forty years, but do not have enough money to live
 padhein- asafal yojanaon kii safal sarkaar- abaki baar event sarkaar Referring to a website, Ravish says that i am aware of the situation of temporary teachers of American professors
 kabhi pro publica naam kii website par padhaa tha ki zyaadaatar Adjunct lekturer garibi rekha se neeche jite hai
 Yes boss
 sarkari yojanaon par ashrith rahete hai or beghar hai
 This information was also used in prime time
 tab se is story ko vahaan or bharat main trek kar rahaa hum
 All of them have been teaching in college for many years
 america main shiksha kaa sarkari bajet bharat kii tarah lagaataar kam hota ja rahaa he
 If you go into the story of thousands of ad hoc teachers of Delhi University, you will see the same frightening scene as America
 ve chhuttiyon ke un do maheenon main kya karte hai, kaise dubak kar rahete hai aap jaanate bhi nahin
 The teachers here also live in a state of poverty
 tanaav main rahete hai or college unka koob shoshan karata he
 Makes hours work
 unke halaat ke bare main kisi saansad ko pataa nahin
 Even Meenakshi Lekhi would not know
 pataa bhi hota to asthaayee taur par rakhe jane kii nitiyon kaa virodh karne kii himmat nahin juta paatin
 The rest of the mps would also have the same situation
 padhein-maine pradhanmantri ko gunda nahin kaha: raveesh kumaar He writes - Now the job of mps is to take the flag of the leader's plans and take photographs
 niti nirmaan main unki bhagidaari kaa twit kahaan dikhataa he kisi ko
 Many teachers also start doing Hindu Muslims on seeing the leader, they talk less about their situation
 ham shiksha nitiyon par dhyaan nahin dete
 The leader has made our condition like sheep by pushing into the topic of Hindu Muslim and fake nationalism
 ham doohe jate hai, oon ke liye dhaage dete hai or hameen maance ke liye jaan bhi dete hai
 Today all colleges in India are run by temporary teachers
 department ke department khaali hai

 gudgaanv pisiar vine apane kshetra ke anusaar chalati he
 In fact, on Monday, a girl was thrown from the auto while walking on Sheetla Mata Road in Gurgaon, in which the girl also suffered some injuries
 
 
 tabhi vahaan se guzar rahe congressi vidhayak ne jaise hi yah dekha vah gaadi se neeche utre or unhone peedit ladki ko sambhalkar uski madad kii
 The MLA himself called the Gurgaon Police Control Room
 
 
 lekin kareeb aadhe ghante tak vahaan gudgaanv police kaa koi numaayinda nahin pahunchaa
 Half an hour later, the Gurgaon Police's PCR van number nine passed from there
 
 
 vidhayak ne use rokna chaha to pisiar vine main baithe pulicekarmi kaa kahana tha ki ve to kisi or kaam se ja rahe hai
 
 
 a second PCR is coming to take the girl
 tippaniyan All this incident was captured in the mobile camera and finally PCR van number nine went out from there without knowing the matter, but this entire case is once again seen by the helplessness of the Gurgaon police, that slogan of supporting the injured girl Leaving on the road, went away
 haalanki, ladki ko auto se phenkane ke maamle main peedita ladki ne police main kisi prakaar kii shikaayat nahin kii lekin is maamle ne gudgaanv police kii pole khol di
 The question arises that if this case too was like Delhi gang rape then who would be responsible for it
 darasal, gudgaanv main somvaar ko sheetala mata road par chalate auto se ek ladki ko phenk diya gaya jisamen ladki ko kuch chotein bhi ain
 
 
 Just then, the Congress MLA passing by, as soon as he saw this, got down from the car and helped him by taking care of the victim girl
 vidhayak ne khud hi gudgaanv police control room main phone kiya
 
 
 But for about half an hour, there was no representation from the Gurgaon Police
 aadhe ghante baad vahaan se gudgaanv police kii pisiar vine nambar nau gujri
 
 
 When the MLA wanted to stop him, the policeman sitting in the PCR van said that he was going for some other work
 
 
 ladki ko le jane ke liye duusari pisiar aa rahi he
 The comments yah sara vakya mobile camere main kaid ho gaya or aakhir main pisiar vine nambar nau vahaan se bina maamla jane nikal gaye lekin is puure maamle ne ek baar phir aapkaa saath dene kaa naaraa dene vaali gudgaanv police kii laachaari najar aa rahi he ki us ghayal ladki ko sadak par chhodkar chale gaye
 However, the girl did not make any complaint to the police in the case of throwing the girl from the auto, but the case exposed the Gurgaon Police
 sawaal yah uthta he ki agar yah maamla bhi dilli gangrape jaisaa hota to iskaa jimmedaar koun hota

 a recent geographical mapping of the Himalayan mountains of the state says that there may be an earthquake of eight or more intensity
 vaigyanikon ke mutabik riyasi folt ne kuch samay se dabaav bananaa shuru kar diya he
 This indicates that when he releases this pressure, the earthquake that hits his garden may be severe, whose intensity may be eight or above
 america ke oregon state vishvavidhyalay main research rah chuke is adhyayan ke pramukh lekhak yaan gevilat ne kaha, 'hamane yah jaanane kii koshish kii ki folt pichley das hajaar saal main kitna hataa he

" 'folt par bukamp ke gatividhigevilat ne kaha, yah folt lambey samay se apane sthaan se sarka nahin he, jiskaa matlab yah he ki ek bheeshanbukampane kii ashanka prabal he
 The question is not whether it is coming? The question here is when is it coming
 is folt par kuch bukampiy gatividhi hone ke bhi pramaan mili hai
 Researchers found that an earthquake lifted a portion of the fault up to five meters or more
 sambhavat: yah 4000 saal pehle hua tha
 Researchers said that written records of local monasteries refer to a severe earthquake a few thousand years ago

 bharat kii kisi airline kaa maalik hona bhi aisa hi he
 This is a business in which you cannot fail, provided you know the tricks of coming down from the rules, the reward will keep falling in your bag
 tamaam gaaje-baaje ke saath jab koi airline kaam shuru karti he, to pehle hi din iske big bos yani maalik ke kamare ke saamne maldaar finance companiyon ke afasaron kii line lag jaati he
 People look forward to filling the Big Boss bag in the hope of earning big money
 lekin kuch hi maheenon ke baad achaanak shor sunai padataa he ki airline diwalia ho gai
 Then more than ever, the crowd of bankers gathers around the Big Boss
 is baar deshbhakti ke naam par ve big bos kii jholii bharne ko taiyaar hai
 Bankers just want Bigg Boss to make two types of deals - the first being secretly with politicians and the second with screaming journalists
 jansampark kii aisi kavayad ke peeche kisi tark kii jarurat nahin padati
 If it doesn't make any sense, it will work
 in chizon kaa dhyaan to ve kaarobaari rakhte hai jo bahut zyada pratishthit nahin hote
 But whatever you do, make a ruckus
 belout kii maang jitani mukhar hogi, bankeron se utane hi zyada aakarshak prastaav milenge or ve janata kii gadhi kamai kaa paisa jhonkne ko taiyaar honge taaki akaash main antaheen jashn jari rahe
 As long as everything is going on in typical English, no one questions it
 nai puunji se dub chuki puunji kaa peechha karnaa aarthik sudhaaron par khadey rashtrawaad kii thos pahchaan he or aise kisi bhi chamakdaar kaarobaar kaa sachcha uddeshy haih chit, main jeeta
 Pat, you lose
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki haarane vaala koun he? jaahir he, aap or main
 All of us fools, who put money in the bank with the confidence that it will be safe, and where will you keep the money in addition to the bank anyway
 airline kaa big bos or banker itane murkh nahin ki ve apni ayyashi ke liye apni jeb se kharch karen
 Cats are not fat by drinking milk brought to their children
 ve dusron kaa khaanaa uda kar mouj katati hai
 The 'borrowing' that bankers also give, is due to the unrivaled imagination of their accountants that they justify it
 jaahir he, ekanutent itnaa samajhadaar to hota hi he ki board gadabadi kaa pataa hone kii baat saarvajanik rup se sweekaare, isse kaaphi pehle vah apni teen percent fees lekar nikal le
 After pretending to have confession, the faces of the board hang up and with full humility, his hand is once again spread
 yahi he uttar aadhunik poonjeevaad kii chakarghinni
 However, as long as there is money coming out of the airport, running an airline is not a bad business
 isamen zyada jhanjhat bhi nahin
 Simply, the rules are different, although you can always bring new rules by removing the old rules
 masalan, ek prayog karke dekhen
 Order a car or needle
 uske paise chukaayen
 Then go to the shop
 aapane jiske liye paisa chukaaya tha, vah saamaan aapako mil jayega
 Now you pay the full money and buy airline tickets
 aapako pataa chalegaa ki aapaki mutthi main sirf ek vaada he jo anishchay kii laharon main dol rahaa he
 If the flight is canceled or delayed due to bad weather, then it can be understood
 lekin dikkat yah he ki airline prabandhan kabhi bhi sahi kaaran nahin bataata
 They only have one shield, 'for technical reasons'
 
 
 mujhe intjaar he ki kabhi to koi gaiyr-takneekee kaaran kaa khulaasa kare
 Is it possible that the announcer may even announce that the flight was canceled because the airline's Bigg Boss forgot to pay for the refueling in the plane, though there was no shortage of oil in his private Boeing
 aisa nahin hoga, kyonki jhooth bolne, munh chupaane or dhokhaa dene vaale ve hi hote hai jo agle din phir aisa hi karte hai
 The real game is that you fail in a big way, like losing in front of millions of viewers
 jaahir he, aisi haar ke baad bich-bich main bhaavnaatmak ubaal bhi laate hi rahanaa hoga
 Then see, who does not bow in your footsteps
 main ek aise airline maalik ko jaanata hum jo kaaphi vinamr hai or isi tareeke se apana kaarobaar bhi chalaate hai
 He perseveres on the possibilities, then personally makes sure that his company makes that possibility an achievement before it has to go into uncertainty
 khud ko simit rakhte hai or agar kisi dost se gap kerani hoti he to kisi coffee shop main konaa pakad lete hai
 Neither do they give a party for page 3 photographers, nor do they interview any newspaper
 unhen isse koi matlab nahin ki koi unhen pahchaan rahaa he yaa nahin, jaahir he, unka naam chhapakar main unhen pareshaan nahin karnaa chahta
 His company is running at a very modest profit, while he also has to pay the same price of oil that everyone pays
 apane daftar main jarur ve ek sitare kii tarah chamakate hai
 He is a class of industrialists who understand that their first commitment is to their industry, not to the fun
 vidambnaa hi he ki aisa role model dharti kaa swarg nahin hota
 It is another earth among the earth
 uttar korea par lambey samay se aarthik pratibandh rahaa he, kuch hi deshon ke saath uske rajanyik rishte rahe hai, to phir uttar korea ko aasaani se parmaanu hathiyaar kii takanic kaise mili? darasal, pakistan ne chori-chhipe uttar korea kii madad kii or use parmaanu hathiyaar viksit karne main sahaayta kii
 North Korea has been threatening the world with nuclear explosions from Pungeri in its northeast
 lekin vakt ne you turn le liya he, ab uttar korea shanti kii baat kar rahaa he
 It has announced the destruction of its nuclear test site
 uttar korea bhavishya main padosi deshon or antarrashtriya samudaay se nikat sampark or baatcheet ko badhaava degaa jisase korian prayadweep par or puure vishwa main shanti or sthayitv kii raksha ho sake
 Pakistan became North Korea's help
 North Korea was almost isolated from the world a few months ago because of its insistence on continuing irresponsible nuclear programs
 gauratlab he ki uttar korea ko parmaanu takat hasil karne main 'aatankistan' ne madad kii thi
 Pakistan, which considers terrorism as a national policy, has been instrumental in North Korea's nuclear programs
 missile technology samjhaute kii aad main di jaankariuttar korea or pakistan ke bich 1990 ke daur main kareebi sambandh bane the
 This was followed by agreements between North Korea and Pakistan to transfer liquid-fueled ballistic missile technology
 donon deshon ke bich samjhauta hua ki unke vaigyanik missile technology par saath milakar kaam karenge
 North Korea helped Pakistan develop the missile and the research center of Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadir Khan informed North Korea about developing nuclear weapons
 teen logon kii maut par khuli polauttar korea or pakistan kaa chori-chori chupake-chupake parmaanu kaarykram ke is paap kaa khulaasa tab hua jab islamabad main ek vaigyanik samet 3 logon kii maut ho gai
 In 2006, there was a blast at Abdul Qadir Khan's Research Laboratory in Kahuta near Islamabad, three people including a scientist were killed
 uttar korea ne pakistan kii madad se parmaanu takat hasil kii lekin is dauraan china se bhi use madad milti rahi
 Because despite all the restrictions, the goods of making nuclear weapons reached North Korea easily under the guise of trade through China
 vaise china hameshaa daawa karata rahaa he ki uttar korea ke parmaanu kaarykram main usne kabhi or kisi tarah kii madad nahin pahunchaayi he
 In an attempt to forget the bloody history of North Korea, however, now North Korea has set a roadmap to destroy its nuclear test site, although the US and South Korea have already made clear that the North Korean sanctions will be lifted only after looking at the evidence
 bataa den ki donon korea ke bich 1950 main yuddh hua tha jisamen lakhon log maare gaye the
 After this, North Korea first gained modern military strength and later nuclear power
 lekin nae daur main uttar korea khooni itihaas ko bhuulane kii eemaandaar koshish karata hua dikh rahaa he

 Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia does not want promotion
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii jagah kareeb-kareeb mukhyamantri kaa puraa kaarybhaar sambhaal rahe sisodiya ne media se baat karte hue kaha ki dilli kaa mukhyamantri banane kii unki koi ichha nahin he
 All important departments of Delhi Government are with Manish
 sabhi mantri bhi unhen hi report karte hai
 Manish said on Tuesday that when the work is going on well as Deputy Chief Minister then why become the Chief Minister
 bina portpholio kaa mukhyamantridilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal desh ke tamaam rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon main is maamle main bilkul anokhe hai ki mukhyamantri hone ke baavjood unke paas ek bhi vibhaag nahin he
 When asked what Arvind is doing and what the Chief Minister is, Manishkar says, 'he works to guide the entire government
 sabake kaam kii samiksha bhi karte hai
 Arvind also does the work of giving new guidelines on the basis of review and perhaps the best way to run the government is that the Chief Minister should have the work of review, guidance and guidance
 baaki kaa kaam to ham sabko karnaa he
 'chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal does not have any department in Arvinddilli, which is absent from the assembly, even though its work is so that Arvind could reach the last day of the assembly session
 aakhri din vidhansabha pahunche mukhyamantri ne naa to sadan ko sambodhit kiya or naa hi dilli ko lekar koi vishesh ghoshnaa hi kii
 In such a situation, it is clear that the 'king' of Delhi is Manish Sisodiyahi and the Chief Minister named Arvind Kejriwal
 vaise bhi kejariwal kaa adhiktar samay baaki rajyon main chunaav kii taiyaariyon main jaataa he
 The Chief Minister's entire focus is on the goa-punjab Aam Aadmi Party, putting all its strength in the elections of Punjab and Goa
 party ke rashtriya sanyojak ke taur par kejariwal donon hi rajyon ko pramukhataa se le rahe hai
 In such a situation, it seems that Arvind Kejriwal has left the entire capital of Delhi on the shoulders of Manish Sisodia to gain power in Punjab and Goa
 kam se kam sachivalay or vidhansabha main mukhyamantri kii upasthiti or unke paas jiro departmental risponsibility dekhakar to aisa hi lagata he
 Alam is that Arvind Kejriwal is either in Gujarat or in Punjab or Goa
 sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki aise main wo dilli par dhyaan bhi den to kaise
 There has been such a thing about Arvind Kejriwal among the anti-career so far that he gets relinquished first responsibility for the next as soon as he gets a responsibility
 masalan, kejariwal iaiti main ejeeniyar bane to iares ke liye ejineering chhod di
 Quitted IRS job to work as an NGO
 sadak par bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ladane ke liye enjio kaa kaam chhod diya or raajnneeti karne ke liye aakhirkaar sadak par sakriy kaaryakarta kaa kaam chhod diya
 When she became the Chief Minister of Delhi, she left Delhi to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 to kya ab yah maanakar chalaa jaae ki dilli ke siem ab punjab or goa kii raah par chal pade hai

 Despite the miraculous popularity of Hardik Patel, Rahul Gandhi's turti, the bjp's state leadership's insignificance and the GST beat, no sensible political observer can make the mistake of undermining the BJP in Gujarat
 phir aisa kya he jo gujarat kii jang itani contili ho gai he
 It is a miracle of the last three years that has made the election of Gujarat the most mysterious election of the last twenty-five years in India
 yah chunaav teen aise sawaalon ke jawaab lekar aayega jinase bhartiya raajnneeti pehali baar mukaabil he
 First - what is the relation of deep economic recession to electoral politics? Second - can inequalities continue to grow despite their progress and their electoral results? Third - Can people's electoral decisions remain unchanged despite booming public movements? What has happened in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state in three years is also completely different from the rest of India
 thik usee tarah jaise ki pichley do dashak main gujarat desh se alag chamakta rahaa tha
 The incident occurred after Narendra Modi moved from Gandhinagar to Delhi
 raajnneetik aabo hawa main is badlaav kii jaden rajyo kii arthvyavastha main hai
 The first government municipality to change the atmosphere in Gujarat was in July 2016 when the country came to know that during 2014-15, Gujarat exited five states with the fastest growth rate in India
 vah ab dasven number par tha or gahari mandi main dhans gaya tha
 The figure for which the figure was showing the financial year was the first year of Gujarat after Narendra Modi
 gujarat chunaavah sansad se sadak tak baikfoot par dikh rahi modi sarkaar, ye hai 3 sabootis vakt tak patidaar andolan pehla saal puraa kar chukaa tha
 The movement of unemployed youth demanding reservation was forcing the BJP to change the head of state and in 2017 would make Gujarat the closest battle for the BJP that it had won in a pinch
 mandi, bekaar or patidargujrat agar koi desh hota to uski mandi duniya main charchaa kaa vishay hoti
 The slope of Gujarat has been faster than the growth rate in the last two decades
 audyogic buniyaad, tateey bhugol or nijee puunji ke kaaran gujarat audyogic growth kaa karishma rahaa he
 Gujarat, with only six per cent of the land and five per cent of the population in India, ran faster than the entire country (up to ten per cent)
 gujarat ne desh ke jidipi main 7
 Took 6 percent and 22 percent share in exports
 (ajeeb baat he ki rigerv bank or niti ayog ke aarthik aankadon kii handbook main gujarat ke gros state domestic product- jiesdipi ke vitt varsh 2013-14 ke baad ke aankadon darj nahin kiye gaye hai
 ) But manufacturing-based economies break down more rapidly in recession (compared to economies with service or agriculture), so the recession and unemployment in Gujarat is much deeper than the rest of India
 yah dhalaan 2013 se shuru hui
 The Patidar youth movement and the beginning of the recession in Gujarat are contemporary
 mandi se karahata gujarat kaa kaarobaar notebandi or jiesti kii chot se bilabila uthaa or chunavi nuksaan ke dar se bhaajapa ko puraa jiesti sar ke bal khadaa karnaa padaa
 Gujarat's charisma of charisma is hidden in the renaissance of its cultivation
 2001 se 2011-12 tak gujarat kaa krishi utpaadan desh kii tulana (3 fisadi ke mukaable 11 fisadi) main apratyaashit rup se tej tha
 Despite agricultural growth, social facilities in rural Gujarat are backward, which is the biggest complication of governance in the last two decades
 2013 se hi kheti bhi mushkil main he jisaki vajah mausam (sookhaa-baadh) bhi he bazaar bhi
 Cities are running in some way due to industry, services and government jobs, but the recession has left opportunities for villages, so the anger of rural Gujarat is the bjp's biggest problem in this election
 andolanon kii hunkargujrat desh se kitna se alag he pichley teen saal iske gavaah hai jab shesh bharat centre kii nai sarkaar ke netritv main achche dinon par charchaa kar rahaa tha tab gujarat andolanon se sulag rahaa tha
 The movements that this state has seen in the last three years have not happened in recent years
 zyaadaatar andolan yuvaao, kisaan, kamgaaron or vyapaariyon ke the jo mandi se buree tarah prabhavit hue hai
 Gujarat has a complex of economic, social and political factors in its small geography, so the election of Gujarat has become the most exciting election of the last two decades
 gujarat ke nattejey pehali baar hamen spasht rup se bataayenge ki mandi or bekaari ke bich log kaise vot dete hai
 It is not necessary to write that these conclusions are going to be very valuable for the future economic politics of India

 Political activity has increased in the legislative assembly as the election time is close, but there is resentment among the local people about the incomplete promises made by political parties in the last elections

 bhaajapa ke ram prasad singh paraste ko haraane vaale congress ke rampal singh vidhayak chune gaye
 Now, with a few months left in the upcoming assembly elections, the leaders of both political parties have become active to get tickets

 At the same time, the saffron party can also place its bets on Ram Prasad Singh
 jabaki congress main vartmaan vidhayak rampal singh tikat ke sabase majboot ummidavaar maane ja rahe hai
 However, the non-fulfillment of promises made in the last election can go against the sitting MLA

 idhar, maidan main takreeban ek dashak se modi ke sabase najdiki sahyogi amit shah apane janmdin ke saath-saath maharashtra or haryana main jeet kaa jashn manaa rahe the
 Amidst all this, the entire responsibility of running the monotonous functioning of the government fell on the shoulders of Arun Jaitley, finance-defense-company Affairs Minister, Urban Development

 In this era of Hinduism, there is complete freedom to compare with ancient texts
 agar modi ram hai to shah or jetali unke lakshmana or arjuna hai, jo unhen sampurna karte hai or jinke bina modi kaa guzaara nahin he
 After coloring the entire country in saffron, Shah is now eyeing Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where assembly elections are to be held in 2015 and 2017 respectively
 unki ahmiyat ke bare main akhabaaron or televijan par bahut kuch likhaa or kaha ja chukaa he
 But it is also true that Ahmedabad is not Delhi and Gujarat is not India at all
 bhale hi shah ne party ko haal main jis tarah fatah dilaai he usase congress kii haalat dhire-dhire 1947 kii muslim lig jaisi lagane lagi he
 It is also to be remembered that when the Supreme Court forced Shah to leave Gujarat in 2010, he took refuge directly in Jaitley's house
 bijepi ke ek netaa ne pushti kii he ki “pichley kuch varshon main ek din aisa nahin beetaa jab donon ne saath khaanaa na khaaya ho
 Despite being the party president, Shah is charged with two murder cases and says Jaitley, a legal expert, is his informal advisor in these cases
 sach to yah bhi he ki jetali is shahar main asli bheetar vaale hai jahaan satta se nikatataa or soochnaaon tak pahunch se hi takat milti he or usee se rasookh banataa he
 Jaitley was the leader of the Akhil Bharti Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the RSS in the early 1970s, then stood in favor of Modi before he became the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 and the dark days of the 2002 riots Modi's hand in the next turbulent years
 iske alaava jetali kaa rajnatik, kanoonee or saamaajik daayaron main vyapak network he
 For all these reasons, Jaitley has acquired the unique ability to sit anywhere next to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 modi satta kii gandh soonghney main jitne maahir hai, use dekhte hue itnaa to nishchit he ki ve acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki agar ve rajdhani dilli main media, korporate or rajanyik jagat jaise mahatvapurn stambhon par apni pakad na bana paae to loksabhaa main 282 siten hasil karne kii anokhi kamyaabi ke baavjood satta-tantra par unki pakad utani majboot nahin rah paaegi
 That is why organizing Diwali meet after Diwali to host more than 400 journalists has a different meaning
 modi or aresas ke kartadhartaaon or anek prachaarkon ko yah bakhubi ilm he ki bijepi main yaa kahie, puri rajnatik birdari main in sabhi samudaayon ke saath jetali jaise madhur rishte bahut kam logon ke hai
 In fact, Diwali Milan Jaitley also had a chance to appear in the hospital after six weeks of recovery
 sitambar ke shuru main maiks aspataal main gastric bypass surgery karaane ke baad kuch samasya khadi ho jane par unhen akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) ke isolation ward main rakhana padaa tha

 inamen shah bhi the jo haryana or maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke bare main baat karne pahunch jate the
 ) Jaitley's weight has decreased by 17 kg and diabetes medicine released since 31 years has also reduced greatly
 unhone is diwaali milan se ek saptaah pehle hi puri tarah kaam sambhala tha
 In the recent times, when the issue of black money came into the limelight and for the first time after coming to power, the government had to face shame, Jaitley was seen as the Finance Minister
 supreme court ko jaldi hi yah maananaa padaa ki khataadharakon kii suchi vah esaity ko degaa, jiskaa gathan may ke ant main kiya gaya tha
 However, Jaitley's old friend Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi had also said in the court that the Finance Ministry had submitted the list to SIT only at the end of June
 lambey samay tak kaam se anupasthiti ke kaaran sarkari dayitvon ko nibhaane ke maamle main jetali kii kami khali ki nahin, is sawaal ke koi khaas myne nahin hai
 His illness could not be hidden from the Prime Minister and the whole country as he was forced to take a break just before the announcement of tax proposals during the budget speech
 aisa viraam pehle kabhi nahin liya gaya
 a few days later, Modi called Jaitley's son and daughter Rohan and Sonali for breakfast at 7 Racecourse Road and said that he would have to immediately persuade his father to undergo bariatric surgery, because, "he still has many more years of meaningful work to do
" 
 ” or iske liye unhen adhik swasth rahanaa hoga
 a source in the family has confirmed this
 aspataal main bhi jetali kii sehat main sudhaar par modi kii najar bani rahi
 Modi also went to see him at Max Hospital before going to America
 ve din main do-teen baar neuyork or washington se sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main apane bhaashan or america raashtrapati baraak obama se mulaakaat ke bich main phone par jetali se baat kiya karte the

 patidaaron kii naaraazgi ke bich is samudaay ke ummidavaaron ke tikat to badaye gaye hai lekin sabase adhik obisi candidet bijepi ne utaara he
 This has led to speculation as to whether the BJP is betting on the OBC vote this time to compensate for the displeasure of the Patidar community
 bijepi jaanati he ki is chunaav main aarakshan kii maang kar rahaa patidaar samudaay usase chhitak saktaa he
 BJP fielded 61 OBC candidates, BJP has given ticket to 61 OBC candidates this time
 jabaki 52 patidaar bijepi kii ore se chunavi maidan main utre hai
 However, compared to the 2012 assembly elections, seven more Patidars have been given tickets this time
 in donon samudaayon ke baad bijepi ne anusuchit janajati ke ummidavaaron ko sabase zyada tikat die hai, jinaki sankhya 28 he
 After this, BJP has given ticket to 13 candidates of Kshatriya community, 12 of scheduled caste and 9 of Brahmin community

 Congress is also cashing in on this issue
 aise main bijepi zyada patidaaron ko tikat dekar jokhim nahin lenaa chaahati
 There is some degree of anger towards the BJP among the Patidars and a large section of the pro-hearty youth will support the BJP in the elections, it cannot be said
 isliye bijepi ne sadhi hui chaal khelte hue zyada se zyada obisi netaaon ko tikat diya he taaki chunaav main patel aarakshan andolan se uthe aakrosh ke asar ko kam kiya sake

 The Congress has released a list of star campaigners for the Lok Sabha election campaign in Punjab
 isamen pehle number par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi, duusare number par sonia gandhi, tisare number par dow
 Manmohan Singh, Asha Kumari at number four and CM Captain Amarinder Singh at number five
 lekin sabase hairaana vaali baat yah he ki is list main navjot singh siddhu kaa naam 28wein number par he
 Sidhu, who claims to have a substantial presence in Punjab politics, may disappoint his supporters by being so low in the list
 haalanki mana ja rahaa he ki captain amarinder singh ke saath unke matbhedon ko dekhte hue unako punjab se philhal dur hi rakhane kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 The party is fiercely using the speeches of Sidhu in other states
 gauratlab he ki siddhu isse pehle bhi punjab main yojit ek kaarykram ke dauraan manch se neeche baithaae jane par apana dard bayaan kar chuke hai
 Apart from this, he did not go to the party office for 20 days even after Sidhu's wife Navjot Kaur refused to give him a ticket from the Chandigarh seat of his choice
 is seat se congress ne varisht netaa pawan bansal ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 There was earlier discussion that Navjot Kaur could be given a ticket from Amritsar seat, from where Amarinder Singh defeated bjp's Arun Jaitley in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 lekin in charchaaon par bhi tab viraam lag gaya congress ne amritsar loksabhaa seat se gurjeet singh ojala ko tikat de diya
 The reason for not paying much attention to Navjot Singh Sidhu in Punjab is his differences with Captain Amarind Singh
 sabase pehle vivaad unka mantri pad par rahete hue ek nijee channel ke kamedi sho main hissaa lene par hua tha
 His subsequent visit to the swearing-in of Imran Khan in Pakistan was also mired in controversies
 captain amarind singh ne unke faisle par sawaal uthaae the
 After this, he was very angry when his wife was not given ticket from Chandigarh or Amritsar and he did not go to the party office for about 20 days
 ek kaarykram ke dauraan unako manch par jagah nahin di gai thi, jiskaa dard bhi unhone sabake saamne bayaan kiya tha
 Let us tell you that the polling for the 13 Lok Sabha seats of Punjab will be held on May 11 and the results will come on May 23

 The BJP and the Left responded that Finance Minister Pranab said that the Prime Minister's Office has received the resignation of Dinesh Trivedi on Sunday and it has been sent to the President for approval as per the constitutional process and until his resignation is approved by the President Trivedi is the railway minister of the country

 She has been an old leader of the Congress from this state
 lekin mahatvakankshaayen anekon netaaon kii hongi
 It will be a challenge for the Congress high command to once again choose a name for the post of Chief Minister as the state elections are due in the state in 2017 next year
 jab indira hrydayesh se poocha ki kya aap mukhyamantri pad par bithai ja sakati hai agar harish ravat ko kuch samay ke liye pad se hatana pade to unhone saaf kaha ki ye to alaakaman ko tay karnaa he
 He did not deny that there is no need or should there be any need to remove Harish Rawat, in a way that the high command should be a sign of this
 phir jab unase poocha gaya ki kya aapke naam kii charchaa mukhyamantri pad ke liye ho rahi he to unhone saaf kaha ki wo to charchaa nahin kar rahi lekin chaaron taraf isaki charchaa ho rahi he
 The stakes in politics go fast

 There are also speculations as to whether they will dissolve it by securing majority in the Vidhan Sabha and get ready for the upcoming elections

" madhya or nimna varg ke voter abhi iske saath majbootee ke saath khadey hai
 However, Abhay Dubey does not completely reject the claim of the Congress that suffered a crushing defeat in the last assembly election
 unhone kaha, ‘vidhansabha chunaav or loksabhaa chunaav ke sameekaran alag hote hai or congress ke puraane voter uske paas laut sakate hai
 'talking about the claim of women in Delhi, it is very unfortunate that the state which once sent strong leaders like Sucheta Kripalani, Mira Kumar, Subhadra Joshi and Sushma Swaraj to Parliament, today has only 10 women candidates in that state
 Which is not even 10 percent of the total candidates
