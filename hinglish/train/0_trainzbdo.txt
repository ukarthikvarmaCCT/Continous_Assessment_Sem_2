 It was also described by some as Tejomahalaya

 uttar pradesh ke vrundavan main 1 sitambar ko rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) kii samanvay baithak main jis vakt bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah hissaa le rahe the, thik usee vakt vahaan se kareeb 200 kimi dur rajdhani dilli main kendriya mantrimandal main pherbadal kii taiyaari chal rahi thi
 The intention of the affiliates of the Sangh was reaching the Prime Minister and in the light of this, suitable characters (ministers) for the departments were being decided
 sangh kii teen divasiy (1 se 3 sitambar) baithak ke samaapan se pehle hi mantripad kii shapath ho gai or vibhaagon kii jimmedaari bhi tay kar di gai
 Of course, this meeting of the Sangh was not for any decision but for mutual dialogue but, the seeds of change were sown here for the policies and policymakers of the central and bjp-ruled state governments on a large scale
 parivartan kaa yah beej kis tarah aakaar le yah baat sangh agle maheene apni kaaryakarini mandal kii baithak main vichaar karegaa
 The BJP leadership has up to five months (march 2018) to bring this idea to the ground
 agle saal march main sangh kii akhil bhartiya pratinidhi sabha kii baithak hogi jisamen sangh is baat ko lekar aashwast hona chahega ki parivartan ke liye tay formule ke tahat bhaajapa or sarkaar sahi disha main chal rahi hai
 It would be necessary to state here that a similar coordination meeting was held in September 2003
 baithak main uthe sawaal ko vaajapeyi sarkaar ne khaas tawvajo nahin di thi
 The voice of the Sangh under the guise of India Shining was suppressed
 us vakt sanghathan or netaa kii drushti se kamjor maani ja rahi congress ke haathon vaajapeyi sarkaar ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, co-government chief Bhaiyyaji Joshi, Krishna Gopal, who was looking after the bjp's work in the Sangh, were present at the All India Coordination meeting
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah 1 sitambar ko din bhar maujuud the
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley were also supposed to be present in the program but they could not reach the meeting due to the masculinity
 in netaaon ke alaava sangh se jude 35 sanghathanon ke pratinidhi maujuud the
 The meeting took place at a time when the Khattar government's failure to handle the Gurmeet Singh case in Haryana and the death and violence of dozens of people were in the news
 gorakhpur ke aspataal main 60 se adhik bacchon kii hui maut ko lekar uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar sawaalon ke chakravyuuh main fansi thi
 Discussion between the ancillary organizations on the eternal question of farmers' suicides and their plight and inflation was shortened
 sangh sutron kaa kahana he ki teen dinon main samaaj or desh se jude har mudde par jamkar charchaa hui or lagbhag har aanushanbik sanghathan kii taraf se yah chintaa vyakt kii gai ki bhaajapa shasit sarkaron se logon ne apni apeksha chhodmai shuru kar di he
 It is unheard of for the public to reach the government through public representatives or organizations
 dhara ulti bah rahi he
 The government wants to make its point implemented through the public or is making it happen
 aisa karne main jo samasyaayein aa rahi hai unhen janata jhel rahi he or sarkaar apni khadi kii hui samasyaon ko dur karne main hi apana samay or urja laga kar apni uplabdhi bataa rahi he
 For example, apprehend the person possessing black money
 sarkaar ne puure desh ko line main laga diya or paanch sau or hajaar ke note ko band kar aam logon kii band tijori main ghus gai
 People suffered immensely and many died
 sarkaar se logon ne yah apeksha nahin kii thi
 Farmers want to see their income doubling and due to government failure farmers have to throw onions and tomatoes
 sarkaar fasal beemaa yojana, par drop-mor crop ko apni uplabdhi bataa rahi he or kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hai
 The government is declaring health insurance scheme as its achievement and children are dying of oxygen deficiency in government hospitals
 baithak main shaamil bhartiya majdoor sangh, swadeshi jaagran manch, bhartiya kisaan sangh, vitt salaahkaar parishad, vishwa hindu parishad kaaphi mukhar rahe
 It was revealed in the discussion that the election results are the result of the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the organization skills and management of BJP President Amit Shah
 lekin prabandhan or lokapriyata kii majbootee ke liye jameen par parinamdai kaam dikhe
 Sources say that the example was given of Goa
 kaha gaya ki vahaan behatar prabandhan kii vajah se sarkaar bani, janata ne to vipaksh main baithne jaisaa janadesh diya tha
 The works which were seen as fruitful on the ground during Manohar Parrikar stopped appearing after his arrival in Delhi
 uttar pradesh main aitihaasik janadesh mila
 But simple improvements are visible in the management of law and order, hospitals and other government institutions
 haryana main pehali baar purna bahumat ke saath bhaajapa sarkaar bani
 People hoped that the problem the state was struggling with would be resolved
 lekin jat aarakshan or rampal prakaran main prashasan jis tarah se chalaa usase laga ki sthiti pehle se behatar nahin he
 After the Gurmeet Singh episode, people were expecting top BJP leaders to teach a lesson to the erring leaders but nothing like this happened
 gorakhpur ke aspataal main 60 bacchon kii maut ke baad vahaan ke swasthya mantri ke khilaaf sakht karwai kii ummid logon ko thi lekin maamle kii jaanch karaane ke puraane formule se baahar vahaan kii bhi sarkaar nahin nikal saki, na hi nikalne kii koshish kii
 Farmer suicide in Maharashtra is not stopping
 bhaajapa ke shashan se pehle bhi yahi sthiti thi
 In such a situation, it is not easy to convince people by simply declaring the incidence of suicide
 jharkhand main sarkari baabuon par niyantran karne main ho rahi dikkat kii baat sanghathan str par kai baar uthi he lekin koi nateeja nahin nikalne se ummid nahin dikh rahi
 The questions of the people remain unanswered in many bjp-ruled states
 mahangaai, khadyannon ke asantulit vitaran, rojgaar, aspataal, shiksha, lalaphitaashahee ko lekar bahut se anutwarit sawaal hai
 It is difficult for the Sangh-affiliated organizations, which work among the people, to say that the government is providing adequate employment
 khaskar har gali-muhalle main darjanon kii sankhya main jab berozegaar yuvaaon or unke mata-pita kii ore se sawaal puche jate hai
 Why is petrol and diesel not being cheap even after the price of crude oil is half in 2014 in the international market? Why are the people's representatives not able to solve the problems of the people through the government? Why the government's policy of Pakistan and China is not succeeding? Why is the situation in Kashmir not coming under control? The BJP President Shah also listened seriously to the mutual discussion and exchange of views of the allied organizations
 bhagwat kii upasthiti main hui baatcheet ko lekar sangh padaadhikariyon ne satr ke dauraan manthan bhi kiya
 Whatever preparation will be done by the BJP on how to solve the questions raised here, Krishna Gopal, who is watching the work of BJP in the Sangh, will reach the RSS office-bearers
 sutron kaa kahana he ki jis tarah se charchaa hui he use dekhte hue centre or bhaajapa shasit rajyon ke nitiniyantaaon main bavaal kii gunjaaish dikh rahi he
 Next month, there will be a discussion about the change in the executive board of the Sangh and the BJP will present concrete answers to the questions raised here before the meeting of the Sangh's House of Representatives in March
 in sawaalon ko taalna na to sangh ke liye sambhav he na hi bhaajapa netritv ke liye
 The Sangh has not forgotten the bjp's wound of India Shining
 vaise bhi modi-shah kii jodi ke liye chook kitna mahangaa sabit ho sakati he iskaa andaja sabhi ko he
 a powerful bomb blast in a madrasa located in a small village in the Punjab province of Pakistan killed 16 people, including several children, and injured 120 others
 adhikariyon ne is ghatana kii pushti karte hue bataaya ki madrase kaa istemaal bam banane main kiya jaataa tha
 The blast occurred at around 10 am local time in a village near Mian Channu in southern Punjab
 sthaneey logon ke anusaar madrasa ke shikshak riyaj ali ke awaas main rakhe gaye visphotakon main yah dhamaakaa hua
 Officials said that Ali is a member of the banned religious group
 police or raahat seva adhikariyon ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki is visphot main 16 logon kii maut ho gayi he
 They include many children
 is visphot se darjanon ghar barbaad ho gaye hai
 Mohammad Yusuf Sumra, health officer of Khanewal district said that the death toll could increase
 visphot ke kaaran gire gharon ke malbon main or shavon ke dabe hone kii ashanka he
 The history of the country and the world is special for several reasons

 a post shared by Akshara Singh (@singhakshara) on Oct 28, 2018 at 7:35 am PDT lagaataar do din main sensex 572 ank ludhaka, nifti main bhi baari giravatoto or banking sector ke sheyaron main guuruuvaar ko badi giravat dekhi gaijankaron kii maane to auto sector ko ummid ke mutabik madad nahin millimodi sarkaar ne sust padati arthvyavastha main jaan foonkane ke liye 23 agast ko kai bade elaan kiye
 It was expected that this would change the situation and the economy car would start running
 lekin elaan ke thik 7 din ke baad agar halaat par gaur karen to lagata he ki uthaae gaye kadam naakaafi hai
 In fact, amidst the news of the continuous recession from different sectors in the country and the fall in the stock market, on Friday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman made an important press conference and made several announcements one after the other
 nirmala sitaraman ne desh ko aashwast kiya ki bhartiya arthvyavastha majboot he or china-america jaise deshon ke mukaable behatar pradarshan kar rahi he
 The fall in the stock market again After the announcement of the dominating minister, most of the stock market was expected to return to brightness
 bazaar ne do dinon tak hare nishaan main kaarobaar bhi kiya
 But after that again the market pressure has come to dominate
 lagaataar do din (buudhvaar or guuruuvaar) main sensex 572 ank ludhak chukaa he
 Talking about the Nifty, a decline of 157 points has been recorded
 kaarobaar ke dauraan banking sector ke sheyaron main sabase adhik giravat dekhi ja rahi he
 The worst of banking and auto sector, the decline in the shares of banking sector, raises the question whether the announcement of giving 70 thousand crore rupees to the banks is also not working
 nirmala sitaraman ne kaha tha ki sarkari bainkon ko 70 hajaar karod rupee die jaaenge
 In such a situation, there will be no problem in giving new loans to banks
 yahi nahin, guuruuvaar ko share bazaar main kaarobaar ke dauraan auto sector ke share main bhi badi giravat dekhne ko mili
 Shares of Mahindra, Tata Motors, Hero Moto and Bajaj Auto closed at the red mark
 jaankaar kah rahe hai ki auto industry ke liye jo madad kaa elaan kiya gaya he vah sthiti ko sanbhaalane ke liye kaaphi nahin he
 According to Fitch Solutions Macro Research, the announcement made by Finance Minister Nirmala for the auto industry last week is not going to be encouraging
 fich solutions ne kaha ki auto sector kii narmi ko thaamne ke liye maal evam seva kar (GST) kii dar main kami or puraane vaahanon ko raddi main bhejne kii yojana jaise kadam uthaae jane chahie
 The market was strong before the budget: The Indian stock market has been experiencing volatility since the budget on July 5 and due to this, the graph of the Sensex and Nifty is moving towards the red mark
 5 july se pehle bazaar main majbootee thi
 The Sensex had also touched the figure of 40 thousand
 bajet ke din bhi 5 july ko sensex 40,003
 89 was reached
 jaankaron kii maane to share bazaar ko bajet se kaaphi ummiden thim
 But the kind of budget that came, affected the stock market the most
 auto sector ko bhi pehle aam bajet se or phir vitt mantri ke haalia elaan se ummiden thim
 But the expectations are high and help is getting some
 auto industry bure daur membta den, desh kaa auto sector reverse gear main chalaa gaya he
 The auto industry has been witnessing a decline in sales for 9 consecutive months
 july main car or motorcykilon kii bikri main 31 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Because of which more than three and a half lakh employees associated with the auto sector lost their jobs and about 1 million jobs are in danger
 aarthik mandi kii vajahevantararashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii badhati keemat kaa asar mahangaai dar par padaa he
 The rupee is depreciating against the dollar
 ek america dollar kii keemat 72 rupee ke aankade ko chhu rahi he
 The decline in exports over imports has increased the country's fiscal deficit and reduced foreign exchange reserves
 iske alaava america or china ke bich jari trade war kii vajah se bhi duniya main aarthik mandi kaa khatra teji se bad rahaa he, jiskaa asar bharat par bhi padaa he
 These were the big announcements of Finance Minister Sitharaman who withdrew the increased surcharge imposed on foreign portfolio investors (fpis) to bring the economy back on track

 They have to pay 3000 rupees for a tanker every day
 unhone bataaya ki sarkari tank main pani nahin aata he, yahi kaaran he ki jaanwaron ke liye pani main bhi dikkatein ho rahi hai
 He said that water lines were put here but his village number comes last

 Here, it was said that water is being provided under Narmada scheme, for this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also did a road show

 There are long queues of women in the village for drinking water
 gaanv waalon kaa kahana he ki netaa log vot maangane to aate hai, lekin pani kii samasya sunne ke liye koi bhi nahin aata he

 Direction is fine, but we also write the story ourselves? i work on the story which i find wonderful

 Star Baichung Bhutia, who has captained the Indian team for the past decade, said goodbye to Indian football in a farewell match against Germany's Bayern Munich at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Tuesday
 baees baar bundesaliga or chaar baar yuapha champiens lig khitaab jeetne vaali byrn munich ne adi dwaara yojit is maitri match main bhartiya team ko 4-0 se haraaya
 His fast-paced and athletic players cannot be compared to the Indian team but he got a historic opportunity to take the field with international stars from this match
 is match se milane vaali raashi sikkim ke bukamp peediton ko di jaaegi
 Striker Bhutia of short stature in 'sikkim' wore a number 15 jersey for the Indian team for the last time and wrote 'baichung Bhutia - The Start of a Legacy' on this particular Nike jersey
 unki aguwai main bhartiya team ne do baar nehru cap khitaab or eeffsi kwalifing toornament jitkar eeffsi asia cap main jagah banaayi thi
 Bhutia played the last match against South Korea in January 2011 in the Asia Cup in Doha, in which he landed for only 15 minutes due to injury
 unka is vidaai match main 90 minute khelnaa sandigdh lag rahaa tha lekin shaayad 35,000 darshakon ke utsaah se vah 84 minute tak maidan par date rahe
 Bhutia, who retired from international football last year, played for the national team for 16 consecutive years since 1995 and captained the Indian team for more than ten years

 pehle half main byrn munich ne 4-0 se badhat lee thi or agar bhartiya golkeeper karanjit singh ne teen shandaar bachaav nahin kiye to pehle half kaa score 7-0 ho gaya hota
 The Indian team was able to reach the opposition team's camp only four times in the first half
 lekin doosraa half bhartiya team ke liye thik thaak sabit hua
 During this time for the first time, the Indians also hit the shot on the straight goal, but j Raja's kick was easily held by Manuel Nuer
 bharatiyon ne is bich gol bachaane par bhi apni kaaphi takat kharch kii or jab bhi gend bhartiya golmukh ke paas jaati bhutia ko chhodkar baaki sabhi khilaadi vahaan deraa jamaa dete
 The Bayern Munich team, which came into the fray with their main team, came to India after attending a one-week practice camp in Doha
 usne vahaan katar ke club ko 13-0 se shikast di thi
 The German club started with a brilliant goal from Gomez in the 14th minute
 29wein minute main aryen robin ke behtareen cross par vishwa cap 2010 ke golden boot thomas mular ne header se behtareen gol kiya
 The comments teesraa gol 38wein minute main mular ne hi kiya, jo do dephendaron ke bich se golkeeper karanjit ko post karte hue gol daagne main safal rahe

 pehle half main bhartiya striker susheel singh ne 28wein minute main bhutia ko cross diya jo gol ke kaaphi upar se nikal gaya
 In the second half, Bayern Munich's team slowed down their game a bit
 jab bhi bhartiya gol ke paas gend jaati bhutia ko chhodkar sabhi khilaadi gol bachaane ke liye apni takat laga dete
 Bayern Munich also fielded France international star winger Frank Ribéry in the 65th minute
 bhartiya coach saviyo medira or khilaadiyon ne khud mana tha ki unhen is match se kaaphi kuch seekhney ko milegaa
 The Bayern Munich stars gave the Indian good advice on passing, skill to control the ball and move fast, and the art of getting the ball out of many players
 match main keval ek pilaa card dikhaaya gaya
 Bayern Munich, who won twenty-two Bundesliga and four-time UEFA Champions League titles, beat the Indian team 4–0 in this friendly match hosted by Aadi
 unke tej tarraar or athlettic khilaadiyon ke aage bhartiya team kii tulana nahin kii ja sakati lekin unhen is match se antarrashtriya sitaron ke saath maidan par utarane kaa aitihaasik mauka mila

 bhartiya team ke liye yah match acha rahaa kyonki pehle half main 4-0 se aage rahane vaali byrn munich kii team duusare half main koi gol nahin kar saki

 The match was good for the Indian team as Bayern Munich, who were 4–0 ahead in the first half, could not score a goal in the second half

 india today ke sampadak prabhu chawla ne ajtak ke sidhi baat kaarykram main bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh se baat kii
 Excerpts: You were very confident of winning, but have you been betrayed or betrayed? Now after all the election results are in place, we will review what were the major reasons that led to the BJP not getting the results as expected
 is samay kuch kahana jaldbaaji hogi
 The 2004 review is not yet complete by 2009
 anant kumaar samiti bithai gai thi 2004 main
 Every political party tries to achieve success
 2004 main jahaan desh ke sirf chaar rajyon main spasht bahumat ke aadhaar par hamaari sarkaar thi, vahiin 2009 ke pehle chah rajyon main spasht bahumat ke aadhaar par sarkaar he
 For the first time, we are running our government with a clear majority in Karnataka, a major state in South India
 yah to ateet kii baat he
 You, Narendra Modi and Advani ji - the three big leaders were confident that you would come as the largest party
 aap or congress main 80 siton kaa fark
 Where is the mistake? If political parties do not believe in winning, then they will not be able to contest any election
 jeet or haar kaa silsilaa chalata rahata he
 It would be such a bad defeat, you know? We did not get the desired success
 hamane turant telephone milakar congress adhyaksha sonia ji or pradhanmantri manmohan singh ji ko badhai di or maine kaha ki bhaajapa baraabar apana rachanaatmak sahyog karti rahegi
 Formality has to be done
 swasth loktantr main isaki apeksha hoti he
 You lost the election for the second time
 aapke netritv kii saakh kam he
 People don't believe in your leadership
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki saakh kam he
 As far as the Congress party is concerned, it has achieved such success after 18 to 20 years
 rajnatik partiyon ke jivan main is tarah ke utaar-chadhaav aate rahete hai, isliye usko lekar hataash nahin hona chahie
 In 18 years, the Congress party reached where Rajiv Gandhi had reached in 1989
 ho saktaa he ki do-dhai saal main rajg usase adhik safalataa hasil kar le
 There will be few elections during this period
 rajnath singh ji aap khayali pilav pakaa rahe hai
 Khayali casserole is not a question
 ham sabko ek vishwaas ke saath phir se aage badhanaa chahie or apni kamiyon ko dur karnaa chahie
 The party that Advani created, the party that Atal ji provided leadership, the party that Advani ji could not win, got cheated
 ve bhi party ke hi ang hai
 There is no question of winning
 kabhi unheen atal ji or adwani ji se shandaar vijay mili to kabhi apeksha ke anuroop safalataa hasil nahin hui
 The pace of your fall has started
 aap 183 se 137 par aae, 137 se 116 par aae
 next time maybe
 
 
 
 You are forgetting the pace of our growth
 aapako hamaare utaar kii yaad he
 If you have to jump high, then you have to go back two steps
 agali baar bhaajapa or rajg nishchit hi oonchi chalaang lagaaegi
 You believe in the Marxist theory of two step forward, one step backward, but you go one step forward, two steps backward
 samyavaadee partiyon kaa jahaan tak prashn he, ve apni vishwasaneeyata khoti ja rahi hai
 West Bengal which has been the stronghold of Marxists, there the Trinamool Congress
 
 
 lagata nahin ki aapkaa koi naaraa galat ho gaya
 You turned negative
 aapane kaha majaboor pradhanmantri, budhinga congress
 The old Congress came to dominate you so much that you had to lick the dust
 yah sawaal khadaa nahin hota he
 We had contested on the basis of issues
 mahangaai ke aadhaar par chunaav ladaa tha, aantarik or bahya suraksha kii samasyaon ke aadhaar par chunaav ladaa tha
 It may be that we did not get as much success as we could in bringing down the issues on which we fought elections
 congress kaa naaraa sidhaa tha-congress kaa haath garib ke saath, aam aadmi ke saath, unke yahaan ke chitra aate the-garib aadmi, majdoor, sadak kisaan
 Only leaders were seen here
 jeet jane par sari achchhaaiyaan hi dikhaai detii hai
 There will be sit-ups with people of all states to see if there were any flaws
 ab adwani ji ne jab apane upar jimmedaari le lee, to aapako lagata he ki aapkaa unke bina guzaara nahin he? aap unako majaboor kyon kar rahe hai?majaboor karne kii baat nahin he
 Advani is a strong leader
 lambey samay se unhone maargdarshan kiya he
 We feel that we need his guidance even in future

 Pakistan Airlines lost 18 crores due to non-passenger flights
 Not a single passenger in 36 Haj planes was aboard, due to the plight of Pakistan Airlines, which did not allow the flight of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to pass through its airspace
 Big revelations have been revealed
 aarthik morche par sangharsh kar rahe pakistan ke vimaanon main ab koi safar tak nahin karnaa chahta
 Alam is that the airlines of Pakistan are not getting passengers, due to which their planes have to fly without passengers
 pakistan international airlines (PIA) ke 82 vimaanon ko bagaiyr yatri ke hi udaan bharna padaa
 e to move Pakistan Airlines suffered a loss of Rs 18 crore
 iskaa khulaasa ek audit report se hua he
 According to Pakistani news channel Geo, Pakistan International Airlines took 46 flights from Islamabad airport in 2016-17, which did not carry any passengers
 iske alaava haj yatra ke liye 36 vimaanon ne bhi udaan bhari, lekin in vimaanon main bhi ek bhi yatri nahin tha
 There was no investigation even after the loss, thus 82 Pakistani aircraft in total flew without any passengers
 iske chalate pakistan international airlines ko 18 karod rupee kaa baari bharkam nuksaan bhi hua
 Even more surprising is that despite so much damage to Pakistan International Airlines, the case was not even investigated, while the Pakistan administration was also informed
 pakistani vimaanon ke bina yatriyon ke udaan bharne kii khabar us samay saamne ai he, jab pakistan aarthik sankat se jujh rahaa he
 Even his food has become red
 pakistan kangaali se jujh rahaa he, lekin uske pradhanmantri imran khan anuchhed 370 ko nishprabhavi kiye jane ko lekar bharat ko lagaataar jang kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 Belly dance for foreign investment, Pakistan, which is facing Fakakashi on the economic front, is even doing insignificant actions to bring foreign investment
 isaki baangi haal hi main purv soviet sangh kaa hissaa rahe ajarbaijan main dekhne ko mili thi
 In order to entice investors to the foreign investors conference in Azerbaijan, Pakistan had organized the program of belly dancers
 pakistan kii sarhad chembar of commers and industry (SCCI) peshawar ne ajarbaijan kii rajdhani baaku main nivesh conference yojit kiya tha
 The purpose of this conference was to bring foreign investment in Pakistan's province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

 a high alert has been declared in Delhi after two terrorists who escaped during the encounter in Jammu and Kashmir were reported to go towards Delhi
 sabhi thanon se kaha gaya he ki ve apane-apane ilaake main silvar rang kii swift car kii khaastaur se jaanch karen
 The car is of Jammu and Kashmir number
 kuch dinon pehle jammu-kashmir main sena va aatankiyon ke bich hue muthbhed ke dauraan do aatanki jammu-kashmir number kii swift car se bhaagane main kaamyaab ho gaye the, jabaki dusron ko javaanon ne maar giraaya tha
 The terrorist can enter Delhi with explosives and ammunition
 sena ko shaq he ki donon aatanki car lekar dilli main ghus sakate hai
 Therefore, intelligence agencies have issued instructions to Delhi Police to remain alert
 teen din pehle di jaankareeintelegence kii ukt soochna ke baad dilli main hai alert ghoshit kar sabhi thanon kii police ko satark rahane ko kaha gaya he
 This information was given to the Delhi Police three days ago
 kal tak arvind kejariwal ke saath kadam se kadam milakar chalane vaale vinod kumaar binni aise baagi hue ki apane saathi ko ghamandi or taanashaah tak kah diya
 On Thursday, the infighting of the AAP came to the fore
 baagi hue binni ne apni hi sarkaar or uske mukhiya kejariwal par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Binny alleged that the AAP government had vowed to the people of Delhi on every issue
 chaahe vah pani or bijli bill main katautee kaa mudda ho yaa phir janalokapal yaa bhrashtachar kaa
 Party leaders want to enjoy the pleasure of power
 ishaare congress de rahi he or naam ke liye AAP kii sarkaar chal rahi he
 Aam Aadmi Party made a difference between the statement and the statement
 Aam Aadmi Party was not formed to make anyone Chief Minister, MLA and MP
 log bhrashtachar or utpeedan se pareshaan the
 Then Anna's movement took place
 jiske baad aam aadmi party kaa gathan hua
 Perhaps due to these principles, the party has got good results in Delhi elections
 par achaanak hi sabakuch badal gaya he
 There has been a lot of difference in the word of mouth in the government
 muft pani kaa mudda'chunaav prachaar main hamane kaha tha ki har parivaar ko 700 litre saaf pani muft diya jayega
 But suddenly the government took a decision which was shocking
 701 litre se zyada pani istemaal karne waalon ke liye sarcharge ke saath bill dene kaa faisla kar diya
 This is a fraud with the public
 'bill nahin bharne vaale 10 lakh 52 hajaar logon kaa kya hua?aap sabhi ko yaad hoga ki dilli sarkaar ke khilaaf arvind kejariwal ne sundar nagari ilaake main anshan kiya tha
 The issue was corruption in water and electricity bills
 log zyada bill aane se pareshaan the
 During this time Kejriwal appealed to the people not to pay the bill
 kaiyon ne aisa hi kiya
 About 10 lakh 52 thousand people had signed an application and registered their protest
 kejariwal ne vaada kiya tha ki jab ham satta main aaenge saare bill maaf kar die jaaenge
 No legal action will be taken against anyone
 par aaj sarkaar bane hue 15 din se zyada biit gaye par un 10 lakh 52 hajaar logon ke saath kiye vaade kaa kya hua
 No one knows hajaaron logon ke upar chori ke cese bane hue hai
 Lakhs of rupees are owed
 yahaan bhi kathani or kerani main fark he
 Even when we were contesting elections, we used to promise the same everywhere
 bijli dar main 50 fisadi kii katautee kar di jaaegi
 That is, a person paying an electricity bill of Rs 1 lakh will have to pay a bill of 50 thousand
 usamen 400 unit vaala condishan nahin laga tha
 We never said that commercial, industrial, domestic and slums will have different rates for people using electricity
 par sarkaar ne vahi kiya
 In order to benefit a few people, the subsidy game was done in a hurry, due to which 90 percent of the people of Delhi feel cheated
 sach to ye he ki sarkaar ko apane daftar main mouj kaat rahi he par mujh jaise vidhayak ko janata kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 It has been 19 days since the government was formed, where was the Jan Lokpal bill? The Jan Lokpal bill was an important issue of the formation of the party
 party ne apane menifesto main yah vaada kiya tha ki sarkaar banane ke 15 din ke andar lokapal bill paas kiya jayega yani 29 disambar ko
 The government was formed on December 28, today 19 days have passed
 par lokapal bill par koi charchaa nahin he
 This is a fraud with the public
 aapane to 15 din kaa vaada kiya tha
 His intention is clear
 kisi tarah se do maheene biit jaaen
 Then due to the Lok Sabha elections, the code of conduct will come into force
 ham satta kaa sukh bhogenge
 What happened on the issue of women safety? The topic of women safety is of paramount importance
 aaj har akhbaar main nai dilli stesan ke paas denmark kii mahila ke saath gangrape kii khabar chhapi he
 The shocking thing is that a minister of the government has no statement on this issue
 agar dilli main kisi duusari party sarkaar hoti to aam aadmi party virodh pradarshan karke mudda khadaa kar detii
 But after coming to government, the issue of women safety became secondary
 mahila commando force ke gathan kii baat thi par ek circular tak nahin jari kiya gaya
 On the issue of corruption, Sheila Dixit and her ministers feel that Arvind Kejriwal has reached an agreement with the Congress on the issue of corruption
 party jab chunaav lard rahi thi tab to yahi kaha jaataa tha ki jaise hi ham sarkaar banaaenge to shila dikshit or unke bhrashtachari mantriyon ke khilaaf karrwai karenge
 But what happened? Leave the action, even an order for investigation was not given
 sabase zyada dukh tab hua jab vidhansabha main kejariwal ne dow
 You asked Harshvardhan to provide evidence against Sheela and her ministers
 sawaal yah he ki jab aapke saboot nahin the to saarvajanik manch se itane gambhir aarope kyon laga rahe the
 Kejriwal dictator and arrogant harewind kejriwal are dictator type
 ve apane saamne kisi dusron kii nahin sunate
 If you agree with them then they are with you or else you keep quiet
 jab ve gussa hote hai unki ankhen laal ho jaati hai
 4-5 people make all the decisions of the party in a closed room
 saare faisle kejariwal karte hai or baaki log haa main haa milaate hai
 If you disagree with Kejriwal's decision, they explain first and then get angry
 aam aadmi party ne anna hajaare, baba ramdev or kiran bedi kaa istemaal kiya
 Manish Sisodia, Arvind Kejriwal, Sanjay Singh and Kumar Vishwas are old partners
 satta main aane ke baad kejariwal ghamandi ho gaye hai
 They behave like dictators

 pulavama hamale ke baad centre sarkaar par lagaataar kade ection kaa dabaav bananaa ho,pakistan ke saath cricket or vyapaar ke sambandhon ko todane kii vakaalat karnaa ho
 Every time the Shiv Sena stays against Pakistan, but something happened on Monday that everyone was shocked
 sanjay raut ne somvaar ko bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue pakistani shaayar habib jaalib kaa ek sher twit kiya, jo jeevanabhar vampanth ko badhaava dete rahe
 Sanjay Raut wrote, 'the person who was the takht-nashiin here before you, was so sure of his own being'
 tum se pehle wo jo ek shaks yahan takht-nashin thouse ko bhi apane khuda hone pe itnaa hi yaqin tha :- habib jaalib— Sanjay Raut (@rautsanjay61)november 18, 2019samaan vichaardhaara vaali bijepi ko chhod sarkaar banane ke liye vipareet vichaardhaara vaali congress-ensipi ke saath aane vaali shivasena shaayari main bhi vipareet vichaardhaara kaa hi istemaal kar rahi he
 On 12 November, Sanjay Raut tweeted in the midst of Maharashtra's political turmoil, while giving BJP credit for the wrong poet
 
 The boat does not cross, fearing the waves, those who try are never defeated
 lekin sanjay raut ye panktiyaan likhte hue kuch galati kar baithe, kyonki unhone iske liye harivansh raay bachchan ko credit diya
 However, this line of poetry is not of Harivansh Rai Bachchan, but of Sohanlal Dwivedi
 kai baar is kavita ko amitabh bachchan koun banegaa karodpati main bol chuke hai or saaf bhi kar chuke hai ki vah unke pita kii panktiyaan nahin hai
 "the boat does not cross, fearing the waves, those who try will never lose
 'bachchan
 we will succeed
 
 Definitely will

 soshal netwarking site or blog par apni tippaniyon ke chalate aksar charchaa main rahane vaale supreme court ke purv justise markendeya katju ne ab swatantraaa senaanee bal gangadhar tilak ko british agent bataakar nae vivaad ko hawa de di he
 Katju has mentioned this in an article in his blog 'satyam Bruyat- Justice Katju'
 lokmaanya tilak kii punyatithi parkatju nipane balog par ki sara desh tilak ko mahaan senaanee samajhataa he lekin vah isse samahat nahin he
 He wrote- 'I know that people will not agree with me and will even abuse me for this, but i do not mind it
 meri najar main tilak rudhivaadee, ativaadee hindutv prachaarak or mahatma gandhi kii tarah ek british agent the
 Their ideology, statements and actions throw bitterness and Raj seems to be inspired by Karowali policy
 katju ne kuch khaas kisson kaa daawa kiya:1
 In 1894, Tilak installed statues of Ganesha in many parts of Maharashtra from house to house and conducted public worship ceremonies
 inamen hinduon se gaayon kii raksha or muharram main bhaag na lene kii apil kii gai
 Similarly, he organized Shivaji Festival in 1895
 2
 In 1891, when British rule proposed to increase the marriage age to 12 instead of 10 years, they also opposed it on the grounds that it is against Hindutva
 3
 When an outbreak of plague spread from Bombay to Pune in 1896, the British government proposed to kill the bacteria by giving smoke to all the houses, Tilak opposed it, saying that it would put a veil on Hindu women
 4
 Tilak had given another orthodox illusionary theory that the real area of the Aryans was in the Arctic
 5
 After being kept in Mandalay jail in Burma for six years, Tilak started acting completely like a British agent
 yahaan tak ki unhone pehle vishwa yuddh main british sena main bharatiyon kii bhartee kaa samarthan kiya
 In addition, Montague Chelmsford also supported the reforms
 6
 Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak both worked to fulfill the interests of the British
 bhale hi unhen iske liye kuch paisa miltaa rahaa ho yaa nahin
 But he did the work for the British government only
 rakshabandhan (raksha Bandhan) kaa tyohaar hindu dharm ke bade tyoharon main se ek he, jise desh bhar main dhoomdhaam or puure harshollas ke saath manaaya jaataa he
 This festival shows the unwavering relationship of siblings, love, sacrifice and dedication
 is din bahanen apane bhai kii kalai par raakhi (rakhi) yaa raksha sutara (raksha Sutra) baandhakar uski lambii aayu or mangal kaamana karti hai
 During Rakshabandhan, many such videos are going viral on Tiktok, which are being shared and liked a lot

 com / l2ntagcewj BHU ke chaatr 14 din se kulapati awaas ke saamne de rahe hai dharnasanskrit ko bhashaa ke taur par padhaaye jane par nahin he koi aitarajuttar pradesh ke banaras hindu uniwarsity (BHU) main muslim teacher dwaara sanskrit padhaaye jane vaale vivaad main nai baat saamne aa rahi he
 Till now it was believed that BHU students are against teaching Sanskrit by a non-hindu professor, but the reality is that the students are opposed to any professor who is not Hindu, he is Hinduism culture and How one can teach about science
 jaane- kya he puraa maamladansal banaras hindu uniwarsity main do vibhaag hai jinamein se ek sanskrit bhashaa, hindi vibhaag ke antargat aata he or doosraa sanskrit vidya dharm vigyaan vibhaag alag se bana hua vibhaag he
 There are different ways of studying in these two
 sanskrit vibhaag main sanskrit ko bhashaa kii tarah padhaayaa jaataa he
 At the same time, in the Sanskrit Science Religion Department, about the customs, mantras, shlokas, rituals of worship and rituals of Sanatan Dharma
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki koi muslim vyakti kaise hindu dharm ke puja paath ke bare main bataa saktaa he, padhaa saktaa he
 The students' opposition is on this point
 unka kahana he ki sanskrit ko bhashaa ke taur par kisi bhi jati- dharm ke teacher dwaara padhaaye jane par unhen koi aitraaj nahin he
 Based on this, the students of BHU have been protesting in front of the Vice Chancellor's residence for the last 14 days
 unka kahana he ki jab tak in muslim professor firoz khan ko duusare vibhaag main transfar nahin kiya jaataa tab tak unka virodh jari rahegaa
 In this case, it has already been made clear from the Vice Chancellor's Office that Feroz Khan has been appointed on the basis of all rules and regulations
 chayan ke dauraan firoz khan ke sabase zyada ank aae the, unki niyukti usee aadhaar par kii gai he
 Therefore, the vice-chancellor continues to talk about the selection of Feroze Khan
 duusari taraf chaatro ne kulapati awaas ke saamne poster binar lagaakar virodh pradarshan jari rakhaa he
 There has been no meaningful dialogue with the Vice Chancellor so far and there has been constant opposition

 There may have been terrorists in place of the woman and it was quite difficult to identify in the dark

 ) 40 CRPF jawans were killed in the terror attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, recently
 is hamale ne desh ko jhakzor kar rakh diya he
 After this attack, the opposition parties are making a ruckus about the Pulwama incident
 darasal sargical strike par vipaksh ko sawaal uthaanaa manhagaa padaa tha, isi maddenjar pulavama hamale par modi sarkaar ko gherne ke bajaay vipaksh bachataa hua najar aa rahaa he
 After the Pulwama terror attack, all opposition parties from the ruling BJP are unanimous and are supporting every move of the government and security agencies
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki is mudde par sarkaar or sena ke har kadam ke saath hai
 Terrorists should be taught such a lesson that they think again before doing such an incident
 isi ke saath unhone kaha ki agle kuch dinon tak wo raajnneetik baat nahin karenge
 At the same time, Priyanka Gandhi also postponed the press conference on the last day of her Lucknow tour
 congress hi nahin vipakshi dalon kii ore se tamaam dal pulavama hamale ko lekar kisi tarah kaa koi sawaal nahin kar rahe hai
 While on the Pulwama attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi to BJP President Amit Shah are constantly talking on this issue in their election rallies
 darasal vipakshi dalon kii khamoshi kii sabase badi vajah sargical strike maani ja rahi he
 The army carried out a surgical strike at midnight in Pakistan after Uri's terror attack
 is dauraan bharat ke sena ne pioke main ghuskar pakistani sainikon or aatankiyon ko maar giraaya tha
 The surgical strike was made public by the Modi government just before the 2017 Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh
 bijepi kii ore se sargical strike ko jashn ke taur par pesh kiya gaya tha or desh bhar main badi-badi hording lagaakar iskaa prachaar prasar kiya gaya tha
 All opposition parties including the Congress had raised questions about the surgical strike and said that the Modi government is using the surgical strike for electoral gains
 sargical strike par vipakshi dalon kii ore se kiye sawaal par narendra modi samet tamaam bijepi netaaon ne sakht tevar dikhaae the
 Apart from this, he had also put the opposition in the circle of questions
 ab aise main pulavama kii aatanki hamale ke baad vipakshi ek-ek kadam phoonk-phoonk kar rakh rahi he
 This is the reason that the opposition is also avoiding asking legitimate questions on the Modi government
 jabaki bijepi vipaksh main rahete hue aatanki hamalon par jamkar manmohan sarkaar ko gheraa tha

 On this issue, Justice Sodhi, while talking to the news agency, answered his 5 questions
 police kii karrwai kii saraahna karne vaale or ise nyaayetar hatya bataane vaale apane-apane tark de rahe hai, lekin kanoon kii drushti se is ghatana ko kis tarah se dekha janaa chahie? is par jawaab dete hue ares sodhi ne kaha,yah tathyon kaa maamla he
 The court sent four accused to 'police' custody, so protecting and caring for them is the religion of the 'police'
 yah kah dena ki ve bhaag rahe the
 How can they escape? You are 15 and they are four
 aapane kaha ki unhone pathar phenke to aap 15 aadmi the, kya aap unhen pakad nahin sakate the? pathar se agar aapako chot ai to pathar maarane vaala aadmi kitni dur hoga
 This made the story a bit hasty

 This story does not suit me
 yah hiraasat main kii gai hatya he
 The law says do the investigation and the investigation should be impartial
 yah jaanch bhale hi inke khilaaf nahin ho, lekin yah cheez kaise hui, kahaan se shuru hui, sab kuch jaanch main saamne aa jayega, isliye jaanch honi behad jaruri he
 Secondly, who said that the accused were raped
 yah to police kah rahi he or aropiyon ne yah police ke saamne hi kaha
 Anyone in police custody can be convicted of any crime
 abhi to yah sabit nahin hua tha ki unhone balaatkaar kiya tha
 They were all young
 ve bhi kisi ke bachche the
 You have investigated them, prosecuted them and killed them
 hyderabad main police karrwai ko lekar, adaalaton ke apraasangik hone kaa sawaal uth rahaa he
 What is your opinion? RS Sodhi responded by saying, "if the police take the court proceedings in their hands, then its step can never be justified
" agar police kanoon ke khilaaf jaaegi to vah bhi waisi hi mulgim he jaise ve mulgim hai
 His job is only to investigate and keep the facts found in the investigation before the court
 isamen prativaadee ko bhi bataa diya jaataa he ki aapke khilaaf ye aarope hai or aapako apni safai main kuch kahana he to kah den
 If the defendant would not be given a chance to prove his innocence and would be shot, it might have been such a justice in some other country, but according to our constitution, it is not justice, so it can be a Taliban justice elsewhere 
 is mulk main nahin
 The Supreme Court has laid down guidelines regarding the police encounter
 inke daayre main prayek muthbhed kii jaanch bhi hoti he, lekin tab bhi police par andeh ko lekar najariya kyon nahin badalata? ares sodhi bole,muthbhed ke baad police par shaq kaa najariya aaj tak isliye nahin badla kyonki police nahin badali
 If there is a death in custody, then the agency will investigate whether you have committed murder
 agar hatya kii he to uski sajaa aapako milegi
 The Supreme Court has guidelines that there should be an independent investigation
 iske baad jo bhi tathy aaenge uske tahat aage karrwai kii ja sakati he
 According to a report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the conviction rate in rape cases in the country in 2017 is very low at 32
 2 pratishat thi
 How do you see 70 percent of rape cases being neglected in the judicial system? RS Sodhi said, "about 33 per cent convictions and 67 per cent have been acquitted
 That means they were innocent
" aap ise is najar se kyon nahin dekhte hai ki nirdosh ko bhi fansaaya ja rahaa he
 Why are you not ready to accept this? If the legal process has been followed and even after that 60 per cent of the accused are released, then they were innocent, so they got released
 jahaan tak police ke apana kaam thik tarah se nahin karne kii baat he to iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki aaropee ko goli maar di jaae
 For this, the investigating agency should be strengthened
 use prashikshan thik tarah se diya jaae
 If the crime has been confessed by the assault, then there can be no conviction
 jaanch sahi hogi or adaalat ke saamne sahi tathy aaenge to adaalat nishpaksh hokar faisla degi
 The court cannot operate under pressure
 nirbhaya maamle ke baad kanoon main badlaav kiya gaya or doshiyon ko faansee tak kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya, naaballig ko lekar bhi niyam badale lekin iske baad bhi dushkarm ke maamalon par ankush kyon nahin lag paa rahaa he
 Where is the scope for improvement even now? Responding, RS Sodhi said, no matter how much the law should be made, nothing will happen until it is implemented properly
 jaanch or doshasiddhi kii prakriya tathaa sajaa ko lagu karne main jab tak teji nahin laai jaaegi, tab tak kisi ke man main kanoon kaa khauf hi nahin hoga
 The law also follows with fear
 mere hisaab se maamle bad nahin rahe hai balki zyada ujagar ho rahe hai jo acchhee baat he
 The more the cases are exposed, the more awareness will come in public
 jab kisi ladki ko sadak par chhedaa jaataa he to log use bachaate nahin, balki uskaa phota yaa video banane ko taiyaar ho jate hai
 People's participation should also be there to prevent such cases
 har insaan ko nijee taur par jimmedaar hona hoga

 They should understand that such mild and irresponsible statements tarnish the country's reputation

 Maulvi takes from Pakistan Salyup Shia Waqf Board Chairman Syed Wasim Rizvi said clearly that Pakistan has given rise to the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute
 pakistan is maamle se jude pakshon ke bich dushmani ko badhaava dene ke liye maulaviyon ko lagaataar fund kar rahaa he
 The aim of Pakistan is that the cleric maintains tension between Hindus and Muslims and this will cause unrest in India

 Earlier, the Shia Waqf Board filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court
 halafname main shiya vakf ne kaha tha ki ayodhya main vivaadit jagah par ram mandir kaa nirmaan kiya janaa chahie
 In addition, the mosque should be constructed in the nearby Muslim-dominated area

 Talking to the Sunni Waqf Board, Rizvi said that the Sunni Waqf Board has neither accepted any decision nor is he going to talk to them
 baaki anya pakshon ke saath milakar hi muslim bahul ilaake main masjid nirmaan kaa formula banaaya gaya he
 Harizvi had said that he had held the disputed land till 1946 and used to be a Shia's Mutawalli, but the British government had transferred this land to the Sunni Waqf Board
 shiya vakf board ne supreme court main kaha tha ki vah vivaad ke shantipurna samaadhaan ke paksh main he

 peedit mahila chaar bacchon kii maa bataai ja rahi he
 The police have registered a case and started investigating the case
 abhi tak kisi aaropee kii giraftaar nahin ho saki he
 According to the police, the woman, who lives in a village in Muradnagar police station area, went to the farm on Monday evening to get fodder for the animals

 On protesting, the youths have beaten and injured him

 The Constitution has given equal rights to everyone, but it is not equal for everyone to get that right
 matlab aap garib hai to kya aapako samay se nyaay miltaa he, yaa amiron ko hi nyaay tezi se miltaa he
 Justice has already become expensive like treatment
 india justise report ke anusaar bharat ke adhinsth adaalaton main ek mukademe ko nipataane main ausatan 5 saal lag jaataa he
 There are 23 lakh cases which are pending for 10 years
 ye thik he ki lambit mukademon ke maamle main bharat ne pragati kii he magar 5 saal kaa ausat bahut zyaada he
 That too at the level of the lower court
 public health foundation of india ke anusaar har saal saadhe paanch karod bhartiya mahange ilaaj ke kaaran garibi main dhakel die jate hai
 The National Statistical Office data also confirms this
 july 2017 se june 2018 ke bich 1 lakh se adhik gharon ke survey main paaya gaya ki aspataal ke kharche kaa 97 pratishat khud bhar rahe the
 Ayushman Bharat is the plan after this, but even before that there were policies for health insurance in many states, even then the condition is the same
 inkaa phayda nahin hua he
 People are dying and becoming poor due to illness
 26 november 1950 ko jab samvidhan angikaar kiya gaya tha tab dow
 Bhimrao Ambedkar had said that we are entering a life full of contradictions
 raajnneeti main hamen samanta hasil he or saamaajik or aarthik jivan main asamnata hogi
 In politics we will follow the principle of one man one vote and one vote one vote
 lekin jaisaa hamaara saamaajik or aarthik dhaancha he usamen ham ek vyakti ek mat ke siddhant ko nahin maanenge
 How long will we live this life of contradictions? How long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and economic life? If we are deprived of it for long, we will put our political democracy in jeopardy
 hamen jald se jald in antarvirodhon ko dur karnaa hoga varanaa jo is asamanta ke shikaar hai wo raajnneetik loktantr ke dhaanche ko dhwast kar denge
 Many feel that hatred about caste and religion has ended in India
 They should be told that in Tamil Nadu last week, a mother burnt her 17-year-old daughter because she wanted to marry a Scheduled Caste boy
 isse pehle ki vah 18 saal kii hoti uske chah maheene pehle uski maa ne hi jala diya
 Later the mother also set herself on fire
 sirf prem ke kaaran jati or dharm ke aadhaar par ek duusare ko jala dene kii kai ghatana har duusare din aati rahati he
 It does not seem that we are living in any constitutional system
 hamaare dimaag main jati kaa jo kachra bharaa he wo jab tak he tab tak vah samvidhan kii aatma kaa anadar he
 Whose brotherhood is mentioned in the preface
 hamaare samvidhan kii khaasiyat yah he ki ek jagah lagata he ki isaki avmaananaa ho rahi he to ek jagah aisa bhi dikhataa he jahaan koi chupchaap iskaa paalan kar rahaa hota he
 The leaders who we most accuse of tearing apart the Constitution were celebrating Constitution Day in Parliament in two ways
 vipaksh ne samvidhan diwas ke maukey par sanyukt adhiveshan kaa bahishkaar kiya
 The opposition alleged that the constitution was being mocked in Maharashtra
 loktantr kii hatya ho rahi he
 Dr
 ambedkar kii pratimaa ke saamne sonia gandhi ne khadey hokar samvidhan kii prastaavna kaa paath kiya
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Ghulam Nabi Azad and other opposition parties were mps
 tiemasi, dimke, sapa en si pi or shivasena ke saansadon ne bhi samvidhan kii prastaavna kaa paath kiya
 The BJP and its allies, on the other hand, celebrated Constitution Day within the House
 modi sarkaar ne hi samvidhan diwas kaa rup diya he iske pehle yah kanoon diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa rahaa he
 Constitution Day has become a major day since 2014
 vipaksh ke bagaiyr raashtrapati ne sanyukt adhiveshan ko sambodhit kiya
 He mentioned the duty and authority given in the constitution
 samvidhan hamen abhivyakti kii azaadi kaa moulik adhikaar detaa he lekin nagarikon se yah bhi kahata he ki saarvajanik sampatti kii raksha karnaa or hinsa se dur rahanaa bhi unka kartavya he
 The right to expression continued after 2014, but the practice of calling dissenters and traitors to Pakistan under this right also started
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki samvidhan granth kitaab he
 It's a good thing
 samvidhan kii majbooti ke kaaran hi bharat shreshth he
 The Prime Minister also addressed the joint session without opposition
 jaisaa ki pehle kaha ki ek jagah samvidhan sankat me dikhataa he to duusari jagah samvidhan sankat se ubarta hua bhi dikhataa he
 Only two pictures of Maharashtra confirm this
 pehali tasviir main shanivaar subah aath baje se pehle devendra fadanvis shapath le rahe hai
 He was accompanied by NCP MLA Ajit Pawar swearing in as Deputy Chief Minister
 raat bhar main maharashtra kii raajnneeti palat jaati he or is ghatana ko sirf ek news agency eenai darj karti he
 The team of Doordarshan running with public money is also not here
 is news ke baad pradhanmantri devend fadanvis or up mukhyamantri ajit pavaar ko badhai dete hai or press sawaal karne kii jagah chanakya niti kii tarif karata he
 This photo was nothing short of a shock
 grahamantri amit shah bhi twit karte hai donon ko badhai dete hai
 Within 80 hours this picture becomes old which was being promoted as a master stroke
 media kaa kaam tha sanvaidhanik prakriyaaon ko lekar sawaal uthaanaa to twitor par kai patrkaar mastra stroke kii tarif kar rahe the
 Look at this picture
 devendra fadanvis rajyapal ko shaam ke vakt istipha saunp rahe hai
 We hold a press conference before submitting my resignation
 shapath lene se pehle press conference nahin karte hai balki press ko bekhbar rakhaa jaataa he
 One day before resigning, he takes decisions without cabinet
 nitigat faisle lete hai jabaki sadan kaa vishwaas hasil nahin tha
 Was it constitutional ethics? Along with him Ajit Pawar, who takes the oath of Deputy Chief Minister, also resigns
 maharashtra kii ghatana 80 ghante main samvidhan kii saans phulane vaali thi lekin isi dauraan isaki pariksha bhi ho rahi thi
 Our politicians are seen following the Constitution when the opportunity is out of their hands
 jab koi rasta nazar nahin aata he
 a tweet by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi should be remembered today
 subah subah bina kisi ko bataae mukhyamantri pad kii shapath ko lekar jab sawaal uthaa to unka twit kya sanvaidhanik maryaada ke anukool tha
 When it happened that after taking the oath, the world came to know that the Chief Minister has happened
 aam taur par yahi hota tha ki pehle pataa chalata tha phir shapath hoti thi
 This is what has happened between one to one political crises
 'jo log maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan hataane or nai sarkaar ke gathan kii prakriya raat me shuru hone par vilaap kar rahe hai unhen jaananaa chahie ki bharat ko azaadi ko aadhi raat ko hi mili thi
 The Union Jack was lowered at night
 navaratri main shakti kii sadhana or deepawali main lakshmi puja kaa anushtha raat main hi hota he
 What will people disconnected from culture and history connect with the public
 'yah ek up mukhyamantri kaa twit tha
 They were trying to explain the right thing by mixing the two right things together
 jis ghatana ko susheel modi azaadi ke elaan or lakshmi ke anushthan se jod rahe the vah ghatana 80 ghante ke bheetar puraani ho gai
 The BJP did not have a majority
 shapath lekar istipha dene ke baad fadanvis ne kaha ki bijepi sarkaar banane kaa prayaas nahin karegi
 He said the same thing before the oath
 sawaal samay kaa nahin tha sawaal tha gupt tareeke se shapath kaa
 What was it that a chief minister takes the oath first and the public is later informed
 isliye hamaara samvidhan sankat main aata he to ubarta hua bhi lagata he
 When the recovery comes, it does not mean the crisis is over
 rajyapal kaa sanvaidhanik pad he
 The tweet by Tripura Governor Tathagata Rai should be remembered on Constitution Day
 'main ek ritred karnal kii ek apil se sahamat hum ki ham kashmir na jaaen
 Do not buy goods from Kashmir Emporium or a winter Kashmiri trader
 kashmir se sambandhit har chiz kaa bahishkaar karen
 (19 February 2019) "in 2015, someone tweeted that where is the Fighting Spirit of Hindus, then the Governor replies that there was an exception in Gujarat 2002
 ''europe main jo bahusamskritwad he wo bharat kii dharmanirpekshata kii tarah he
 This means that Muslims will stick to their customs and others will have to adjust
 ''linkan ne apane desh ke bantwaare ko rokane ke liye grih yuddh kar liya tha, congress aisa kyon nahin kar sakati thi
 They are equally responsible for the partition
 ''rohingya maamle ke samay twit kiya tha ki myanmar ke paas vivek he, ham logon ke paas dharmanirpekshata he
 That is, they were supporting the killing of a community
 'samvidhan kii prastaavna main jis bandhutav kii baat kii gai he uskaa inke twit main kai baar ulanghan dikhataa he
 Union ministers have expressed disagreement many times with their tweets themselves, but Tathagata Roy sits on the same post
 yah bataata he ki samvidhan kaa ulanghan karte hue koi sanvaidhanik pad par bana rah saktaa he yaa sanvaidhanik pad par rahete hue koi samvidhan main die gaye bandhuta ke siddhant kaa ulanghan kar saktaa he
 It should be remembered here that during the hearing in the Aadhaar case in the Supreme Court, Mukul Rohatgi, as the representative of the Central Government, had said that citizens do not have full authority over their bodies
 thik usee ke baad supreme court ne niztaa ke moulik adhikaar par shandaar faisla diya tha or sarkaar ko uski seemaa bataai thi
 The same Mukul Rohatgi was saying in the court that the court cannot order the governor when the floor test will be held
 jaanate hue bhi ki court kai baar aadesh de chukaa he
 And the court did the same
 maharashtra main floor test ke aadesh de die
 As i said, whenever i feel that the Constitution is not being followed, the Constitution is being followed at some other place
 ab aap dekhie
 The platform from which the Prime Minister is delivering the speech in Daltonganj is also accused of a drug scam of 130 crores and another candidate who is accused of killing Varden of his school
 bijepi ne bhanu pratap shahi or shashi bhushan mehta ko tikat diya he
 This does not mean that the Congress or the opposition has given tickets to the candidates according to the spirit of the Constitution
 aisa bilkul nahin he
 But what would have been the helplessness of the Prime Minister that the accused in the 130 crore drug scam stands with him, that too a day before Constitution Day
 kul milakar samvidhan diwas par sabake liye yahi sandesh hona chahie ki hamen sabhi system ko majboot or sabake liye sulabh bananaa he
 Emergency is certainly a shameful event but it is not that in normal days the call and apprehension of emergency is not heard but at times concrete evidence is also seen
 aisa nahin hona chahie ki chunaav ayukta ashok lwasa pradhanmantri kii raily ke maamle main alag tippanee kar den to unke parivaar ke khilaaf jaanch shuru ho jaae or ve jahaan jahaan jin jin padon par rahe hai uski jaanch shuru ho jaae
 Many related news has been published in the media
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan jab ek chunaav paryvekshak mohammad mohsin pradhanmantri ke helicopter kii jaanch kar de to uskaa tabadalaa ho jaae
 Mohammad Mohsin is an IAS officer and was suspended
 mohsin ke maamle main ste chal gaya or aap ko bataanaa chahenge ki is maamle main cat main sunwaayee chal rahi he
 The last hearing was held on October 31
 chunaav ayog ne cat ke ste ke khilaaf hoicourt main maamla bhi darj kiya he
 As i said, at one place the constitution looks weak and at other places the constitution looks strong
 yah samvidhan kii majbooti hi he ki pradhanmantri se lekar aam aadmi tak usamen aasthaa zaahir karata he
 'today, if Baba Saheb had been there, he would have been very happy that in all these years of India, he has not only answered his questions but has also made his freedom more prosperous and empowering democracy
 or isliye aaj ke is avasar par main sabhi ko beete saat dashak main samvidhan kii bhaavana akshunn rakhane vaali vidhayika or karypalika or nyaaypilaaki ke sabhi saathiyon ko gauravpurvak samaran karata hum
 If such efforts have been made, the countrymen have failed it together and have not allowed the Constitution to come down
 'pradhanmantri kii yah baat sahi he
 If the people sitting in these institutions played with the Constitution, then the people sitting in these institutions kept it safe
 bhale hi unki sankhya bahut kam thi
 Democracy is a system of daily practice
 yah bana rahe or bachaa rahe iske liye har kisi ko har din abhyaas karnaa padataa he
 Otherwise the power that plays the game in the dark of night, the oath which is made before the people wake up, remains the final truth
 shaam ko istipha dekar us prayaas ko asafal karne kaa mauka hi nahin aata
 Now come on the events of Maharashtra
 pehle supreme court main kya hua
 a three-judge bench of Supreme Court Justices NV Ramana, Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice Sanjiv Khanna said that there should be an immediate majority test to uphold democratic values
 shivasena, ensipi or congress kii yachika sweekaar karte hue court ne kaha ki agar bahumat pareekshan main deree hoti he to loktantric mulyon kii raksha karne kii karrwai main court ke saamne aadchan aa jaati he
 Immediate majority testing may be the most effective mechanism in such a case
 yah nirdhaarit karne ke liye jaldi se jaldi bahumat pareekshan zaruri he ki mukhyamantri, jinhen pad kii shapath dilaai gai he, ke paas bahumat he yaa nahin
 The Supreme Court said that we request the Governor that a special session of the assembly be called on 27 November
 ye bhi kaha ki loktantric mulyon, nagarikon ke sushasan ke adhikaar ko banaae rakhane ke liye maharashtra main bahumat nirdhaarit karne ke liye flor test ke liye antarim aadesh paarit karnaa aavashyak he
 The court also gave strict guidelines that an interim speaker i
e
 the Protem Speaker will be appointed only to administer the oath to the mlas before 5 pm
 uske turant baad floor test hoga
 There will be no secret ballot and the majority test will be broadcast live
 isse bhi ahm baat court ne ye kaha ki teen maheene ke baad court maharashtra ke rajyapal ke fadanvis ko aamantrit karne ke faisale kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata par bhi gaur karegaa
 An answer has been sought from all the parties in eight weeks
 supreme court ke is aadesh ke baad devendra fadanvis or ajit pavaar ke saamne istifa dene ke alaava koi chaara nahin bachaa kyonki somvaar raat ko hi mubani ke ek hotel main shivasena, ensipi or congress ke 162 vidhayakon ke ek saath aa jane se in dalon main tut kii koi bhi sambhaavna baaki nahin rah gai thi
 First Ajit Pawar resigned as Deputy Chief Minister
 devendra fadanvis ne maharashtra ke mukhyamantri pad se istifa diya
 Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari urged Fadnavis to remain the acting Chief Minister until the next government was formed
 istifa dene se pehle fadanvis ne press conference kar kaha ki sarkaar banane ke liye bijepi ko janadesh mila tha
 But we had few seats left
 devendra fadanvis ne kaha, 'unhone kaha ki shivasena, ensipi or congress teen aisi partiyaan jinaki vichaardhaar bilkul alag alag hai
 They have come together only to keep the BJP out
 unka saajha nunemat kaarykram mahaz ek dhokhaa he
 Ajit Pawar had a letter of support but then things changed
 ab bijepi vipaksh main logon kii awaz banegi
 Fadnavis did not say why he believed the support letter given by Ajit Pawar, what happened to him
 ab ajit pavaar agar duusare kheme main chale gaye or ensipi shivasena or congress kii sarkaar banegi to ajit pavaar kaa kya hoga
 What will happen to the charges of more than 90 thousand crores imposed on him
 kya aise log paala badal badal kar bachate rahenge
 Following the resignation of Fadnavis, activities at the Raj Bhavan in Mumbai increased
 rajyapal ne bijepi ke vidhayak kalidas columbukar ko protem spikar ke taur par shapath dilaai
 Kalidas has been an eight-time MLA from Columbar Wadala and it is tradition that the most experienced and old MLA is chosen for the Protem Speaker so that there is no dispute of any kind
 protem spikar kaa kaam sirf vidhayakon ko shapath dilvaanaa hota he
 So Protem Speaker Kalidas Colombar will administer the oath of office to the legislators on Wednesday
 iske baad congress ne press conference kar kaha ki gair kanoonee tareeke se shapath lene vaale devendra fadanvis ko aaj istifa dena padaa he
 We hope that the Governor will perform his responsibilities by rising above selfishness, removing his mask of the Sangh
 ummid he rajyapal shivasena-ensipi-congress ke gathbandhan ko sarkaar banane ke liye bulaayenge
 According to the Congress, the matter does not end here but starts from here
 bijepi ne saalon se sarkari mashinari or taaqat kaa durupyog kiya he
 The Congress said that the Fadnavis government was built on the foundation of lies and the cards were folded
 ye sirf devendra fadanvis kii hi naakaami nahin he balki dilli main baithe unke hukmaranon ke chehre par bhi tamaacha he
 Uddhav Thackeray will be the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 unhen shivasena, ensipi or congress ke vidhayakon ne apana netaa chunaa he
 He will take oath at Shivaji Park in Mumbai at 5 pm on December 1
 unhone kaha ki shapath grahan main wo bade bhai narendra modi ko bhi bulaayenge
 That is, the news that was published in newspapers on Saturday morning became false and the news was corrected on Tuesday evening

 Police have been upset by supporters of Shambhulal Reger, accused of killing a man in the name of Love Jihad in Rajsamand district of Rajasthan
 soobe main sampradayik maahaul bigadate dekhakar teen logon ko police ne giraftaar kar liya he, jabaki chah ke khilaaf cese darj kiya gaya he
 The police is keeping a close watch on social media
 jaankaree ke mutabik, lav jihad ke naam par afrajul naamak shaks kii barbar hatya ke baad jinda jalaane ke aaropee shambhulaal regar ke samarthan main kai log soshal medi par muhim chalaa rahe hai
 Everybody was putting videos in favor of Shambhulal
 santosh naamak ek vyakti ne to shanbhu kii patni kaa bank detail soshal media par share kar diya
 Along with this, people were appealed to help Shambhu's wife
 isko dekhakar kai logon ne shanbhu kii patni ke acount main paise bhejne shuru kar die
 After this, the police who got into action, got that bank account refrigerated
 police ne elaan kiya he ki aaropee ke samarthan main muhim chalaane waalon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii jaaegi
 Some Hindu organizations have announced on social media that they will hold a meeting in Rajsamand in support of Shambhulal on 14 December
 haalanki, unka naam or pataa abhi tak police conform nahin kar pai he
 The cyber team is investigating the matter
 police kaa kahana he ki jaldi aise logon ko giraftaar kiya jayega
 Rana Thakur, a sermon who calls himself a national pracharak of the Vishwa Sanatan Sangh, has released a video threatening to rally in Rajsamand

 Some people want to spoil the communal atmosphere in the state by creating such an atmosphere in favor of Shambhulal
 aisa nahin karne diya jayega
 Police has registered a case against 6 people in this case so far

 But people kept provoking and i was not even satisfied
 vidvajjanon ko dobaaraa tatola
 This time he found that initially he had also ruled out the existence of this word, because this question suddenly came to him
 padhie, clivej ke liye hindi shabd kii talash: bhaag ekadusri baat yah he ki hindi kaa sahitya samaaj zyaadaatar maamalon main kranti or pragatishiltaa ke paas rahata he, aise main is tarah ke saundaryashastreey vimarsh use kuch ochhi harakat lagate hai

 By the way, the term Kuch Bich was used in erstwhile literature even beyond the limits of adornment

 These uses of the word bitch got instantaneous
 iskaa matlab he ki reeti kaal main or sanskrit sahitya main jarur aise shabd honge jo vidwaanon ko pataa honge
 i am doing so much exercise here so that we can avoid the tendency that is to lie perpendicular to English words without looking in the tradition
 duusari bhashaa ke shabdon kaa koi nishedh nahin he, lekin ek baar apane ghar main jhaank lene main kya harj he
 Well, one more thing, whether the word 'kuch Bitch' used 300 to 500 years ago can be used in flat earnest
 mujhe isamen andeh he
 In common parlance, one day the word 'bulge' will replace it

 The Supreme Court on Monday gave Aligarh Muslim University four weeks' time to respond to the Center's affidavit in which the Modi government has decided to withdraw the petition filed by the UPA government
 upie sarkaar ne aligarh uniwarsity ko alpsankhyak santhaan nahin bataane vaale faisle ko chunauti di he
 On Monday, University lawyer PP Rao in Justice JS Khehar's court had sought some time to reply to the Center's affidavit, which was accepted by the court
 court ne apane faisle main kaha, 'uniwarsity council sarkaar ke hafalanaame kaa jawaab dene ke liye samay chaahati he, lihaaja use 4 hafte kaa samay diya jaataa he
 'it is to be noted that earlier on Thursday, the Central Government has said in the Supreme Court that it will withdraw the appeal of the previous government challenging the decision of the Allahabad High Court
 atorni general mukul rohtagi ne kaha, 'hamane (sarkaar ne) ek halafanama daakhil kiya he, jisamen kaha he ki ham apil ko waapas lenge
 He said that the Center has filed an affidavit in this regard in the Supreme Court
 uniwarsity prashasan ne bhi is mudde par hai court ke faisle ke khilaaf ek alag yachika daakhil kii thi
 'the government was founded, not the Muslims' Rohtagi told the court on Thursday,' AMU is not a minority institution
 ' unhone 1967 ke sheersh adaalat ke ek faisle kaa ullekh kiya, jisamen kaha gaya he ki yah alpsankhyak santhaan nahin he kyonki sarkaar ne isaki sthapana kii thi, muslimon ne nahin
 Earlier, the top law officer had said in the Supreme Court that Aligarh Muslim University was established under a central law
 saath hi 1967 main ajij baasha maamle main paanch nyaayadhishon kii ek samvidhan peeth ne kaha tha ki yah ek kendriya vishvavidhyalay he or alpsankhyak santhaan nahin he
 No AMU Minority Institution: Governor Kalyan Singh on the other hand, the Governor of Rajasthan and former Chief Minister of UP Kalyan Singh have also said that Aligarh Muslim University is not a minority institution
 unhone kaha, 'yah ujisi kii funding se chalata he
 You can call it a central university, but a minority institution
 ' unhone iske saath hi centre sarkaar ke taaja halafname ko uchit bataaya
 'amendments to the law made in 1981' On Thursday, Mukul Rohatgi, who was favoring the government, told the court that an amendment was brought in 1981 in the Central Law to make the said decision null and void the university as a minority institution
 To go, which has recently been declared unconstitutional by the High Court
 rohtagi ne april main bench ke samaksh kaha tha, 'aap ajij baasha faisle kii avhelnaa nahin kar sakate
 The Indian Union is of the view that giving AMU status as a minority institution would be contrary to the Aziz Basha decision
 ' bench ne tab centre ko aavedan daakhil karne or uske dwaara daakhil apil ko waapas lene ke liye aath saptaah ke bheetar halafanama daakhil karne kii anumati di thi

 tamaam chunaavon main hindu-musalamaanon ke bich dhruvikaran kar vot batorne kii baat koi nai nahin he, lekin kya is dhruvikaran se votaron par koi prabhaav padataa he?india today exis maai india ke eczit pole ke anumaan ke mutabik hindi bhashi rajyon main jahaan par desh kii aadhi musalmaan aabaadi rahati he vahaan congress ne khub vot batore, uttar pradesh ko chhodkar sabhi rajyon ke musalmaan votaron ne congress kaa hi haath pakadaa
 In which states are the Muslim voters loyal to the Congress? According to exit poll data, in Uttarakhand and Rajasthan, Muslims voted the Congress the most
 uttarakhand or rajasthan ke kul musalmaan votaron main se 88 pratishat votaron ne congress party ko vot diya
 After this, about 83 percent of the Muslims of Haryana voted for the Congress
 madhya pradesh main 82 fisadi to jharkhand ke 80 fisadi muslim aabaadi ne congress ke haq main vot daale
 In Bihar too, Congress got 79 percent Muslim voters, while in Delhi, about 69 percent Muslims voted for Congress
 uttar pradesh main kya rahaa aankadadesh ke zyaadaatar hindi bhashi rajyon ko chhod den to uttar pradesh ye sthiti bilkul ulat thi
 There was no alliance between Congress and SP-BSP and the party contested all the seats alone
 congress ko ummid thi ki wo upi main musalamaanon ke vot paane karne main kaamyaab ho jaaenge lekin aankade kuch or hi baat bayaan karte hai
 According to exit poll data, the Congress party suffered damage due to the non-involvement of the SP BSP alliance and the Muslim voters left the claws
 aankade bataa rahe hai ki lagbhag 76 pratishat votaron ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko vot diya
 Why distance from BJP where Congress got support from Muslim voters everywhere except in a Hindi speaking state, while exit poll figures show that BJP did not get even 15 percent of Muslim votes in all these states
 madhya pradesh, jharkhand or bihar main 14 pratishat votaron ne bhaajapa+ ko vot diya
 In Haryana too, only 13 percent of Muslim votes went to BJP
 dilli main congress ko musalmaan vot kam mili, lekin uske baavjood bhaajapa keval 10 pratishat hi musalmaan voter praapt kar pai
 21 percent of Muslims in Delhi voted for the Aam Aadmi Party
 vahi uttarakhand(9), rajasthan(9) or uttar pradesh(8) main bijepi 10 pratishat muslim vot bhi nahin bator pai
 After Andhra Pradesh, the Central Investigation Agency (CBI) will not be allowed to enter West Bengal also
 pashchim bengal kii mamata banerjee sarkaar ne sibiai ko soobe main chaape maarane yaa jaanch karne ke liye di gai ‘saamaanya rajamandi’ shuukravaar ko waapas le lee he
 a top official of the state secretariat gave this information
 pashchim bengal sarkaarake faisle se pehle andhra pradesh sarkaar ne bhi yahi kadam uthaaya
 After the announcement of the Andhra Pradesh government, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had supported the Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu on this issue
 mamata banerjee ne kaha tha, ‘chandrababu naidune bilkul sahi kiya
 BJP is using CBI and other agencies for its political interests and revenge
 ’pashchim bengal main saal 1989 main tatkaaleen vam morcha sarkaar ne sibiai ko chaape maarane or jaanch karne kii saamaanya rajamandi di thi
 After Friday's notification, the CBI will have to seek the permission of the state government to conduct any investigation in cases other than the court order, an official said
 sibiaidilli vishesh police pratishthan kanoon ke tahat kaam karti he
 Earlier, this was announced by Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu

 However, sources have said that no bank has received any letter in this regard
 sutara kaa kahana he ki is tarah kii notification milane kii sthiti main sibiai faisle ke khilaaf kanoonee sahaara le sakati he
 It is believed that the state government's relations with the Center deteriorated after the Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP government parted ways with the NDA this year
 naidu 2019 main hone vaale aam chunaav se pehlevipakshi dalon ko ekajute karne main jute hai
 He alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and YSR Congress together are destabilizing the state government

 Congress leader PC Chacko said that Chandrababu Naidu has done what every state should do

 kendriya pratyaksh kar board ne form 16 ke praaroop main badlaav kiye hai
 After the new changes, more information will be entered in the form than before
 nae form 16 se online inakam tex ritern file karne waalon ko sahuuliyat milegi
 The objective of these changes in Form 16 is to bring uniformity in the figures related to direct tax
 pehle samajhie kya hota he form 16?yah form ek niyokta apane karmchaaree ko detaa he
 It contains information about salary and tax deducted during the financial year
 form 16 ke do hisse hote hai
 Port a contains details of the employer and the employee
 masalan, naam, pan number, pataa aadi
 On the other hand there is information about salary and tax
 kya hue nae badlaavis saal jab aapke niyokta kii ore se aapako form 16 diya jayega tab usamen kuch nae head jude honge
 For example, if you have income from any other source other than salary, then it will be known in Form 16
 masalan, kiraye se aay yaa kisi anya santhaan ko di gai salaah ke badale mila mehtaanaa
 Also, all types of tax-free allowances will also have to be given in Form 16, eg LTA, HRA etc
 iske alaava 80 si ke antargat yadi kisi karmachari ne kar bachat kii he to uski jaankaree bhi form 16 main di jaaegi
 That is, the new Form 16 will have more information inside itself than before
 inakam tex ritern bharna hoga aasananaukareepesha logon ko inakam tex ritern bharne ke liye form 16 kii jarurat padati he
 Till now, due to lack of income from other sources, in addition to Form 16, the taxpayer had to enter other details (if any)
 lekin form 16 main hue nae badlaavon ke baad aisa nahin hoga
 If a taxpayer is filing his income tax return online and has given all the details correctly to his employer, the system will automatically extract all the information from Form 16
 yah jaankaree apane-aap inakam tex ritern form main darj ho jaaengi
 In this way, after the new format of Form 16, income tax return filing will become easier
 badlaav kii jarurat kyon?tex export ankit gupta kehete hai, ‘’in badlaavon ke baad pratyaksh kar se jude aankadon main ekarupata aa sakegi
 "so far, if the tax figures are mixed according to Form 16 and for filing income tax return, then there is a difference which is also natural
 kyonki inakam tex ritern bharte samay karadaata form 16 ke baad bhi atirikt jaankaree darj karte the
 But after the new format, the uniformity in tax return figures can be brought
 inakam tex ritern bharne kii antim taarikh 31 july hoti he
 Necessary ITR forms have been notified by CBDB for filling the return for the financial year 2018-19

 chunaav sudhaar kii prakriya main chunaav ayog ne kanoon mantralay ko apni sifarish main kaha he ki ek pratyaashee ko do siton se chunaav ladane kii chhot nahin honi chahie
 The Election Commission has recommended to the Union Law Ministry that the provision for contesting elections from two seats of one candidate be abolished
 chunaav ayog ne iske alaava kuch or sanshodhan bhi kendriya vidhi mantralay ko bheje hai
 According to the Election Commission, so far a candidate has the right to contest from two seats and there is also a system of leaving one seat if both seats are won
 ullekhneey he ki 1996 se purv ummidavaar kitni bhi siton se lard saktaa tha
 The Commission said that if the government wants to keep this provision, then the responsibility of incurring the cost of the by-election should be put on the candidate leaving the seat
 vidhansabha va vidhanparishad ke upachunaav ke maamle main raashi 5 lakh or loksabhaa upachunaav main raashi 10 lakh honi chahie
 The government may increase it from time to time
 ayog ne kaha ki pratyaashee kaa seat chhodana votaron se anyaay ke samaan he
 Apart from this, the Election Commission has said that people with public liabilities should be prevented from contesting elections
 is bare main chunaav ayog ne 2015 main dilli hoicourt ke aadesh kaa hawala bhi diya he jisamen kaha gaya tha ki sarkari bangale, bijli, telephone, pani, hotel, airline aadi kaa bhugtan na karne vaale logon ko chunaav ladane se roka jaae
 The Election Commission said that the candidate who left the seat in the by-election should bear the expenses of 5 lakh and 10 lakh for the Lok Sabha
 ayog ne kaha samay samay par is raashi ko badhaayaa bhi janaa chahie
 This will be the second major policy decision of the Modi government after the announcement of demonetisation to control black money, which is likely to be announced soon
 vidhi or kanoon mantralay ke vidhayika vibhaag ne is bare main sambandhit sabhi vibhaagon ko paripatr jari kiya he, jisamen jald hi ayog kii siforishein lagu karne kii baat kahi gai he
 Two suggestions of the Law Commission are worth noting
 pehla, aise maamle jinamein kam se kam paanch saal kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan he, chargeshit vaale netaa ko chunaav ladgaye kii anumati na ho
 Secondly, fast track courts will be set up to hear the cases going on against the leaders of political parties, who have to pronounce the verdict within a year
 fast trek court se sajaa paane vaale bhale hi upree adaalat se bari ho jaaen, lekin un par chunaav ladgaye, raajnneetik party banane or raajnneetik dal main padaadhikari banane par hameshaa ke liye roak lagaai jaae
 The comments bataa den ki chunaav sudhaar ko lekar beete dhai dashak se kavayad chal rahi he
 The Modi government has sought suggestions in this regard from the Law Commission
 chunaav ke dauraan ped news (paise lekar kisi ummidavaar ke paksh main khabar dikhaane yaa chhapane), state funding (ummidavaar kaa kharch sarkaar degi), jhuthe shapathpatr, kharch kaa byoraa kam bataane or aparaadhon main aaropee ummidavaaron ke chunaav ladgaye par roak lagane jaise muddon par sahmati banane ke prayaas chal rahe hai

 chunaav ayog ne kendriya vidhi mantralay se sifarish kii he ki ek ummidavaar ke do siton se chunaav ladgaye kii praavdhaan ko samaapt kiya jaae
 Apart from this, the Election Commission has also sent some more amendments to the Union Law Ministry
 chunaav ayog ke anusaar abhi tak ek pratyaashee ko do siton se chunaav ladane kaa adhikaar he or donon sitane jeetne par ek seat chhodane kii vyavastha bhi he
 It is noteworthy that before 1996, the candidate could contest any number of seats
 ayog ne kaha ki yadi sarkaar is praavdhaan ko banaae hi rakhana chaahati he to upachunaav kaa kharch uthaane kii jimmedaari seat chhodane vaale ummidavaar par daali jaae
 In the case of by-elections to the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council, the amount should be 5 lakh and in the Lok Sabha by-election the amount should be 10 lakh
 sarkaar ise samay-samay par badha sakati he
 The commission said that leaving a candidate's seat is an injustice to the voters
 iske alaava chunaav ayog ne kaha he ki saarvajanik dendariyon vaale laagon ko chunaav ladane se roka jaae
 In this regard, the Election Commission has also cited the order of Delhi High Court in 2015 which said that those who do not pay government bungalows, electricity, telephone, water, hotel, airline etc
 should be prevented from contesting elections
 chunaav ayog ne kaha ki upachunaav main seat chhodie vaale pratyaashee ko 5 lakh or loksabhaa ke liye 10 lakh ke kharch kaa vahan kare
 The commission said that this amount should also be increased from time to time

 lekin iske thik ulat is jail me kaidiyon ke saath jis tarah kaa bartaav kiya jaataa he wo puri insaaniyat ko sharmasaar karne vaala he
 The process of corruption starts from the prison door itself
 aarope he ki kaidiyon se mulaakaat ke liye aane vaale rishtedaaron ko hi pehle jail ke staff kii mutthi garm karne padati he

 yaheen nahin adhikariyon ke kuch chahete kaidiyon ko bhi duusare kaidiyon kii dhunaai kaa license mila hua he
 According to the convenience, the rate is now decided to tell you how the game goes on in jail, the game of giving inmates in jail on the basis of money
 yahaan kaidi kii jeb moti he to use manamaangi har chiz muhaiyaa ho jaati he
 Aaj Tak also got a rate card of facilities in jail
 iske mutabik jail main aise vasuuli jaati he sahuliyaton kii keemat-sabji-400 rupye kilocigarette-30 rupye kii ekbear-500 rupesharab-1000 se lekar 3500 rupemobile-10 hajaar rupee mahininspection se pehle chakachak hoti he jailkasna jail main 3000 kaidi he
 According to the charge, there is an illegal earning of at least one lakh rupees in jail every day
 or to or, baqayada register ke jariye is kamai kaa hisaab bhi rakhaa jaataa he
 In a video from inside the jail, an announcement was also made that an inspection is going to happen, so whoever has the money, bidi, cigarette or any offensive thing can hide it
