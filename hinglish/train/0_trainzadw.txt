 The entire family of 55-year-old Sula Bai is dependent on rice cultivation

 Will they eat themselves and will they feed the animals? aise main gaanv kii auraten jo bhi kaam mili vah kar rahi hai or apana ghar chalaane ko koshish kar rahi hai

 Earlier, even after extending the deadline to sell the stake 2 times, the government had not received any application in this regard
 ek varisht adhikari ke anusaar, sarkaar kaa saamanyataur par yah maananaa he kisir indiakisi gharelu nikaay ke haathon main hi rahe
 He said, 'we have decided to adopt a strategy of wait and see (on the disinvestment of Air India) for the next three-four months
 'unhone aage kaha ki abhi eendhan kii keemten adhik hai or hamen vinievesh prakriya ke saath aage badhane ke nirnay kii vahniyata par faisla karnaa hoga
 The official said, 'the entire aviation sector is currently facing a crisis mainly due to high fuel prices
 'air indiamein sarkari hissedari bechney ke prastaav ko nivida kii antim tithi 31 may tak koi praathmik boli nahin mil saki thi
 The government has decided to sell 76 per cent equity share capital in the national carrier

 Apart from Air India, its low cost unit Air India Express and Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited will also be sold under the deal
 air india ke ranneetik vinievesh ke liye nikaale gaye ruchi patr (ioai) ke liye pehle se tay samaysima 14 may thi
 Later, the government had extended the EOI submission date to 31 May, but still no buyer was found

 Sachin Tendulkar, Jacques Kallis, Muthaya Muralitharan and Ricky Ponting will try their best to make the World Cup a memorable one as it could be the last chance while they get an opportunity to showcase themselves at the Cricket Mahakumbh
 srilankai spinner muralidharan (38 saal) pehle hi ghoshnaa kar chuke hai ki vah is toornament ke baad antarrashtriya cricket ko alavida kah denge
 Indian star batsman Tendulkar (37), South African all-rounder Kallis (35) and Australian captain Ricky Ponting (36) are also unlikely to play in the 2015 World Cup
 ponting (1999, 2003 or 2007, inamen se antim do vishwa cap main vah captain the) tathaa muralidharan (1996) pehle bhi vishwa champion team kaa hissaa rah chuke hai, lekin phir se yah pratishthit trophy haath main uthaanaa chahenge
 Tendulkar, who is on the verge of equaling Javed Miandad's record of playing in six consecutive World Cups, has achieved many achievements in Tests and One Day but he would not like his record to play the most World Cups without winning the title even once
 Be registered kallis bhi apane karier main kabhi vishwa champion team ke sadsy nahin rahe
 In view of the injuries, Indian fast bowler Zaheer Khan (who will be 36 years old by 2015) may also not be able to join the next World Cup squad

 The New Zealand team will have skipper Daniel Vettori, all-rounder Scott Styris and Jacob Oram possibly missing the Black Caps squad in 2015

 The Supreme Court on Wednesday cleared the validity of the leaked documents from the Ministry of Defense, dismissing the arguments of the Center, giving a big blow to the Narendra Modi government
 chunavi mausam main court ke is faisle ke baad vipaksh ek baar phir centre par hamalavar ho saktaa he
 While hearing the Rafael case on Wednesday, the country's top court approved the validity of the leaked documents from the Ministry of Defense, which paves the way for a re-hearing on the case
 court ke faisle ke mutabik ab ye dastavej supreme court main sunwaayee kaa hissaa honge
 At the same time, the court also said that it will set a date for hearing the reconsideration petitions on Rafael
 court ke is nirnay ke baad rafel deal par lambey samay se centre kii bijepi sarkaar par hamalaa karne vaali congress or vipakshi dalon ke paas phir se is mudde ko uthaane kaa mauka mil gaya he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been targeting PM Modi for a long time on the Rafale deal from public forums
 supreme court kaa yah faisla aise samay aayaa jab congress adhyaksh rahul amethi se loksabhaa chunaav ke liye apana namakan daakhil karne vaale hai or ek din baad hi desh main pehle charan kaa matdaan hona he
 In such a situation, during the Lok Sabha elections, Rafael's case has become hot

 Challenging the debate on corruption Rahul Gandhi has been continuously attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Rafale deal
 rahul ne pradhanmantri modi ko phir se bhrashtachar par bahes karne kii chunauti di he
 Rahul Gandhi had tweeted on Tuesday that dear Prime Minister, are you afraid to argue with me on corruption? i make it easy for you
 kitaab kholkar aap in vishyon par taiyaari kar sakate hai: 1
 Rafael + Anil Ambani 2
 neerav modi 3
 Amit Shah + Demonetisation
 isse pehle 7 april ko bhi rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri modi par twit kiya tha, 'aap bhaag sakate hai par chhip nahin sakate hai
 Your karma will not stop you
 sach bahut taqatvar he
 i challenge Modiji to debate corruption
 tab, rahul gandhi kii ore se di gai chunauti par bijepi ne hamalaa karte hue kaha tha ki congress adhyaksh ek bekhbar netaa hai
 Meanwhile, after the Supreme Court verdict, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted and targeted Narendra Modi, saying, 'modi ji was saying everywhere that he got a clean chit in Rafael from the Supreme Court
 aaj ke supreme court ke faisle se sabit ho gaya ki modi ji ne rafel main chori kii he, desh kii sena se dhokhaa kiya he or apana jurm chhipaane ke liye supreme court ko gumraah kiya

 The central government had claimed in court that the documents related to the Rafale fighter jet deal with France were privileged and stated that these documents cannot be treated as evidence as per Section 123 of the Indian Evidence Act

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator Now call it merely coincidence or the Lokpal Bill
 ise ajtak 8 baar sansad main pesh kiya gaya
 But what is not known is that till date this bill has not been passed
 alabatta, sarkarein, jinhone ise pesh kiya, unamem se zyaadaatar lautakar hi nahin aa pain
 The lokpal bill that Anna is following behind the government is a strange irony of that bill
 sunne main ye bada atapata sa hi lage, lekin is bill kaa kuch siyaasi itihaas aisa he, jo bada rochak bhi he or sarkaar ke liye thodaa daraane vaala bhi
 However, all this can only be coincidental
 naa hi in baton kaa koi bhi vaigyanik aadhaar he
 Nevertheless, it is an interesting political development that whoever touched this bill, his government got stuck
 ek najar lokapal ko lekar ab tak ke lafde par
 The bill passed in the Lok Sabha during Indira Gandhi in 1968 but the law could not be enacted
 1971main bel phir pesh hua lekin loksabhaa bhang hone kii vajah se bill laps kar gaya
 It was introduced in 1977 by Morarji Desai's government
 lekin standing cameti ko die jane se pehle hi loksabhaa bhang ho gai
 Morarji had withdrawn from the PM before this
 1985main rajeev gandhi ne sansad main bill pesh kiya par 1989 main unki sarkaar nahin bani
 In 1989 VP Singh introduced the bill in Parliament
 lekin pehle unki kursi gai or phir nauveen loksabhaa bhang ho gai
 In 1996, Deve Gowda introduced the bill in Parliament but the Lok Sabha was dissolved before the bill was passed
 1998main atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar is bill ke babat sansadeey cameti kii siforeeshon ko dekh paati, usase pehle hi unki sarkaar gir gai
 However, in 2001, the Vajpayee government referred the bill again to the Standing Committee
 lekin bill paas hone se pehle hi loksabhaa bhang ho gai or vaajapeyi kii sarkaar laut nahin pai
 It is clear that most of the government which introduced this bill in Parliament has not been re-elected
 ab pataa nahin ki saal 1963 main aayaa ye idia naa jane kab kanoon banegaa
 Action on the impeachment motion against President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan is going to start from Monday

 musharraf ke jawaab ke baad sadan un par mahabhiyog chalaane kaa prastaav paarit kar saktaa he
 Senior PML-N leader Ishaq Dar said the chargesheet would be comprehensive
 donon netaaon ne kaha ki aaropapatr ko sansad main pesh kiye jane ke baad saarvajanik kiya jayega
 Dar said that from Monday, the provincial assemblies of Punjab, Northwest Frontier Province, Sindh and Balochistan would pass a resolution asking Musharraf to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament
 is prakriya ke puure hone ke baad neshnal assembly yaa sansad ke nichle sadan main mahabhiyog kii prakriya shuru hogi

 Attacking the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said that there is nothing to tell in the name of contributing to the freedom of the country, only these two organizations which spread hatred
 inhone desh ko naa to mahatma gandhi diya or naa hi sardaar patel
 Rahul, in his election meetings held in Amethi, alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is doing politics to divide and break the country
 jati ko jati se or dharm ko dharm se ladaana modi kii aadat ban gayi he
 He is doing the same in Uttar Pradesh
 unhone ‘naa hindu banegaa naa musalmaan banegaa, insaan kii aulad he insaan banegaa’ geet kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki modi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii vichaardhaara vaala hindustan kabhi nahin bana sakenge
 The Congress vice-president said that none of the great men who made unforgettable contributions to the independence of the country had any connection with the BJP or the Sangh
 chaahe mahatma gandhi hon, sardaar patel hon yaa phir bhagat singh
 The BJP and the Sangh have nothing to tell
 unhone sardaar patel kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki modi party kii raajnneeti ke liye mahaan vibhootiyon ko baantne kaa kaam naa karen
 Rahul accused Prime Minister Modi and BJP President Amit Shah that both these people keep telling him a lot
 yah sab unhen manjuur he lekin amethi or raibareli kii upeksha bardaasht nahin he
 He said that earlier Modi was happy but after the alliance of SP and Congress in the state, his face has changed and he has started doing politics of spreading hate
 rahul ne phir aarope lagaaya ki modi ne desh ke 50 amir pariwaron ko ek lakh 40 hajaar karod rupee kaa karj de diya, lekin unhen ve garib kisaan nahin dikhaayi diye
 He could have forgiven his debt if he wanted, but he did not do so
 unhone kaha ki modi ne udyogpati vijay maalya ko 1200 karod rupee de diye or yah dhankuber landan bhaag gaya
 The comments rahul ne kaha ki modi jahaan bhi jate hai, ek nayaa vaada kar dete hai
 He always makes false promises and breaks the dreams of the youth and the poor
 unhone amethi main food park pariyojna ko radd kiye jane kaa mudda ek baar phir uthaate hue kaha ki modi sarkaar ne yahaan food park nahin banane diya
 If it was established here, then 10 thousand people would have got employment and lakhs of farmers of the area would have benefited
 rahul ne apane amethi main yojit chunavi sabhaaon main aarope lagaaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi desh ko baantne or todane kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 It has become Modi's habit to fight caste with caste and religion with religion
 vah uttar pradesh main bhi yahi kar rahe hai
 Referring to the song 'naam banega banega na musleman banega, Insane ki aulad hai insane banega', he said that Modi will never be able to create a Hindustan with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ideology
 congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki desh kii aazaadee main avismaraneey yogadan karne vaale mahapurushon main se kisi kaa bhi vaasta bhaajapa yaa sangh se nahin tha
 Be it Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel or Bhagat Singh
 bhaajapa or sangh ke paas bataane ke liye kuch nahin he
 Referring to Sardar Patel, he said that Modi should not do the work of distributing great personalities for party politics
 rahul ne pradhanmantri modi or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ye dono log unhen bahut kuch kehete rahete hai
 All this is acceptable to them but the neglect of Amethi and Rae Bareli is not tolerated
 unhone kaha ki pehle modi khush the lekin pradesh main sapa or congress kaa gathbandhan hone ke baad unka cheharaa badal gaya he or vah nafrat failaane kii raajnneeti karne lage hai
 Rahul again alleged that Modi gave a loan of one lakh 40 thousand crore rupees to 50 rich families of the country, but did not show them poor farmers
 vah chaahate to unka karj maaf kar sakate the, magar unhone aisa nahin kiya
 He said that Modi gave Rs 1200 crore to industrialist Vijay Mallya and this Dhankuber fled to London
 tippaniyan Rahul said that wherever Modi goes, he makes a new promise
 vah hameshaa jhuthe vaade karte hai or yuvaaon tathaa garibon ke sapanom ko todate hai
 He once again raised the issue of cancellation of the food park project in Amethi, saying that the Modi government did not allow the food park to be built here
 agar yahaan isaki sthapana hoti to 10 hajaar logon ko rojgaar miltaa or kshetra ke lakhon kisaanon ko phayda hota

 42 karod rupee kii kamai kii he, jabaki tamil or telugu main isaki kamai 2
 80 crores
 yahi nahin film ne videshon main kamai ke lihaaj se bhi record banaaya he
 The film, made under the banner of Yash Raj Films, has received amazing response
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah film pehle hafte main hi 200 karod rupee kama legi
 Aamir Khan and Abhishek Bachchan's thriller got success on the first day, Aamir Khan is very happy
 unhone kaha ki isse mujhe bahut raahat mili he
 According to the latest assessment, the first day's earnings will set a record
 'ek tha tiger' ne pehle din 31
 a record was made by earning 2 crores, but with all the bookings it seems that this film will break that record
 big cinema ke sioo ashish saxena ne kaha ki hamen ummid he ki kamai ke maamle main yah film sabase zyada kamaane vaali filmon main hogi
 Movies were not playing in the last quarter, now this film is a boon
 ab tak is film ne har tarah se safalataa pai he
 Its advance booking is complete, it has good stars and it also has corporate bookings
 pichley dinon kai filmein flop huin thim, jinamein ranbir kapur kii 'besaram', akshay kumaar kii 'bos', saf ali khan kii 'bullate raja' or imran khan kii 'gori tere pyaar main'

 5 karod rupye mili hai

 On the first day, the film will earn from 31 to 35 crores
 lekin unhone kaha ki agar yah film choti hoti to or kamai hoti kyonki tab shoj zyada hote
 The reason behind the record earnings of this film is that its tickets are very expensive
 kuch distributaron kaa maananaa he ki agar tikaten 20 pratishat tak kam hoti to kamai or zyada hoti
 Then more people came to see it
 shahrukh khan kii 'chennai express' ne pehle din 29 karod rupye kii kamai kii thi jabaki 'agni path' ne 21
 85 crores and 'body guard' 21
 25 karod rupye kii kamai kii thi

 Sri Ram Chandra also left Sita ji on suspicion

 However, he also apologized after this statement was disputed
 unhone kaha ki mere bayaan ko galat tareeke se liya gaya
 Women treated unfairly in all communities, not just Muslims, even Hindus, Christians, Sikhs etc
 In every society, there is male domination
 Even Shree Ram Chandra ji once left Sita ji after doubting her

 haryana ke panchkula main ek jangal main teen bacchon ke shav milane se sansani fail gai
 The children have been brutally murdered

 In the Morni forest of Panchkula, three children were embittered by the funeral
 sthaneey logon ne is baat kii soochna police ko di
 The police also immediately reached the spot after hearing that the children were dead in the jungle and took all the three bodies
 police ke mutabik mritak bacchon kii shinaakht kar lee gai he
 The three children were residents of Sarasa village in Kurukshetra
 jinke pahchaan 11 varshiya samir, 8 varshiya simran or 4 saal ke samar ke rup main hui he
 Surprisingly, these children were missing from their village itself and the police are responsible for the murder of their father and uncle
 saath hi police avaidh sambandhon kii khatir bacchon kihatyakiye jane kaa shaq bhi jataa rahi he
 the seriousness of the case , several police officers including DCP Manveer Singh of Panchkula Police reached the Morni forest
 mauka-e-vaardaat par jaanch padtaal karne ke liye forencik team ko bhi bulaayaa gaya he
 However, the reason for the murder is not yet clear
 police ne panchnaame kii karrwai karne ke baad teenon bacchon ke shav postmortem ke liye bhej die hai
 Now the police is investigating the case
 aisa dikhataa to he ki uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party ke raajnneetik dangal main muqabla mulaayam singh yadav or akhilesh yadav ke bich ho rahaa he
 Both are face to face and are engaged in strengthening themselves in political domination
 lekin kya aisa vaaki he ki pita or putr main thani hui he yaa phir yah sara khel darasal kisi badi ranneeti kii ore ishaara karata he
 There are strong reasons for believing this
 uttaradhikaar kii ladaai main raajnneeti kaa sara khel do logon ke bich khelaa ja rahaa he or baaki sab yaa to pyaade bane hue hai or yaa phir tamashbin
 It has happened that Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav have become stronger and stronger
 khaskar akhilesh ke liye yah ladaai kai myanon main sakaaratmak he
 Mulayam Singh has been known for such sports in politics
 kaha jaataa he ki mulaayam singh kayaason or atakalon ko hameshaa se hi dhata bataate aae hai or wo aise vyakti hai jo kisi bhi vakt kisi ko bhi chaunkaane kii kshamta rakhte hai
 What those right-handers are doing, they don't even understand the left-hand side
 isliye bevajaah hi mulaayam apni party or parivaar ko asthir hone de rahe hai or wo bhi thik tab jab rajya ke vidhansabha chunaav sir par khadey hon, aisa yakeen karnaa mushkil lagata he
 The soil that is made of soft, in the back of the stage, the inking of each other and big game is getting clear
 or yah bhanak he uttaradhikaar ke yuddh kii
 Losses: Look carefully at the entire political crisis of the Samajwadi Party and the Uttar Pradesh government as to who are the people who have suffered the most in the entire game of the Yadav family
 shivpal zarur mulaayam kii shai par khelte nazar aa rahe hai lekin is dauraan shivpal mantrimandal se makkhi kii tarah nikaalkar baahar kiye ja chuke hai
 He was thrown out of the cabinet twice by Akhilesh within a month
 aaj sthiti yah he ki sanghathan par ecchhatra raaj karne vaale senapati kii sena kaa ek bada hissaa akhilesh ke paksh main naare buland karata nazar aa rahaa he
 Shivpal has little credibility in government
 or samaajawaadee party main unki kilabandi ko akhilesh dhwast kar chuke hai
 Ramgopal is another face who has the ability to play inside this party
 vajah he unka yadav parivaar se hona
 He may have less public support and is the less popular face of the party, but he is aware of the weak pulse of the clan and hence punishing him in the name of Akhilesh is like lowering his height
 yah aashcharya nahin he ki sapa ke professor sahib ab akhilesh stuti gane ke liye baadhya hai
 Some may say that Akhilesh Yadav has suffered a direct loss of this infighting of the party
 lekin aisa he nahin
 In fact, the Samajwadi Party has suffered
 party ko hua nuksaan saajha he
 It is not only Akhilesh
 is nuksaan kii keemat keval akhilesh ko nahin chukaani he, sab iske bhuktabhogi banenge
 Akhilesh became strong and it can be said that Akhilesh is in the least loss position in this whole development
 akhilesh to balki phaayde main rahe hai
 They now have complete control over the government
 aaj lagbhag saare vidhayak akhilesh ke saath hai
 The cabinet stands with him
 akhilesh ke saath party ke kaaryakartaaon kaa ek bada hissaa jud gaya he or akhilesh ke ishaare par wo ek nae raajnneetik manch ke saath unako majboot karne main jute saktaa he
 Akhilesh has gained the sympathy of every section of the society in response to the attacks of clan and outsiders
 har vyakti akhilesh kii ore sahanubhuti kii nazaron se dekh rahaa he
 This was not the case until a few months ago
 akhilesh ko apane vyaktitv ke saath saath puure kunbe kii chhavi ko bhi dhonaa pad rahaa tha
 It is not so now
 usee kunbe ke hote hue bhi akhilesh aaj ek alag vyaktitv or behatar vikalp ke taur par dekhe ja rahe hai
 Akhilesh's biggest victory is that even though he has been doing politics like his father and family, today Akhilesh has emerged as a better political option with a modern and strong image apart from everyone else including his father
 saadhe chaar saal jis sarkaar par saadhe chaar mukhyamantriyon kii sarkaar hone kaa aarope lagata rahaa, wo sarkaar chunaav se thik pehle ek vyakti kii sarkaar he
 Even a single person like Mulayam Singh Yadav is unable to shake him from his throne
 akhilesh pehali baar itane majboot or nidar mukhyamantri banakar ubhare hai
 Why Mulayam is doing this The most important thing for Mulayam, coming at the age of his age, is to choose his successor and establish him
 mulaayam ne shaayad isi manshaa se is puri ranneeti ko rachaa hoga, aisa spasht nazar aata he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's first commitment is to himself
 lekin unke baad vaale sawaal par unka ek hi vikalp he or wo he unka betaa akhilesh yadav
 People can say that son is also Prateek Yadav
 lekin pratik yadav mulaayam singh yadav ke bete nahin, sadhana gupta ke bete hai
 Mulayam Singh Yadav has given him his name but he is not a child born of his blood
 isliye mulaayam kaa jo moh or lagaav akhilesh ke prati he, wo kabhi bhi pratik ke prati nahin ho saktaa he
 Akhilesh has not done anything wrong that he should come out of Mulayam's eyes and take someone else in his place
 balki pita ne jo zimmedaari putr ko saunpi, use akhilesh ne bakhubi nibhaayaa he
 Prateik was never enthusiastic about politics
 isliye mulaayam singh yadav ko babul main aam lagane kii ummid nahin he
 Akhilesh, written more than a symbol, has put his feet on the head of his father's head and put his feet in the politics of politics
 ab mulaayam chaahate hai ki unka padukadharak unke naam or prabhutv ko aage le jaae
 This is the reason that in 2012, the crown of power was placed on the head of Akhilesh keeping the entire family members aside
 lekin 2012 main jo uttaradhikaar paanch saal kii kursi tak simit tha, wo ab vyapak hokar party or parivaar tak aa gaya he
 There is little scope for sp's return in this election in the state
 or agle chunaav ke aane tak yaa uske liye party ko jis chehre kii zarurat padegi, wo netaji shaayad na hon kyonki umr ab unpar haaavee hone lagi he
 Today, in Samajwadi Party, Akhilesh Yadav is the second biggest name after Mulayam Singh Yadav
 apane baad ke grihayuddh kii ashankaon ko janmane se pehle hi netaji se khatm kar diya he or ab akhilesh apane parivaar or party kii chhavi se mukt bhi ho gaye hai or uske uttaradhikari bhi ban gaye hai
 In such a situation, Akhilesh has emerged as a strong, modern, honest, efficient ruler and a leader of clean image to keep him in politics
 yah sab naahak nahin hua he
 Much of this has been possible due to family feuds that have been going on since this month
 aisa saaf dikhataa he ki netaji ne kopbhavan kaa khel dikhaakar apana ram dhund liya he

 curtis ke mutabik trump pehle hi sanket de chuke hai ki ve bharat ke saath sambandhon ko or majboot banane main dilchaspee rakhteheritage foundation se judin curtis ne 'da daily signal' main ek lekh main kaha
 'actually, if there is a meaningful role for the US in reducing the tension between two nuclear-powered rivals, it is to pressurize Pakistan to take strong action against the anti-india terrorists who operate openly on their land
 ' curtis ne kaha he ki trump ke pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke saath phone par baat karne ko lekar chintaaen vyakt kii ja rahi hai
 At the same time it is being linked with the future policies of Trump in the subcontinent
 bataa den ki pakistan ne ek bayaan main kaha he ki trump ne navaj ke saath phone par baat main peshkash kii ki vah pakistan ke lambit muddon ko sulajhane ke liye 'koi bhi' bhoomika nibhaane ke liye taiyaar he

 curtis ne kaha ki bharat-paak rishton ko lekar america kaise nipatata he, yah najuk maamla he
 According to Curtis, it is important for American officials not to fall into the trap of mediation
 saath hi aise kisi bhram main bhi naa aaen ki america khud hi 70 saal puraane is vivaad ko nipta saktaa he
 Regarding the recent attacks on several camps of the Indian Army, including Uri, Curtis said that it was Pakistan's keenness to draw international attention to Kashmir
 curtis ne kaha ki america ko dikhaanaa chahie ki is tarah kaa bartaav asweekaarya he or inke gambhir nattejey ho sakate hai

 Today, Prime Minister Modi has joined the list of these great leaders who have used this strangely contradictory term in history for their benefit
 is saal swatantraaa diwas par apane sambodhan main modi ne pakistan ke satta pratishthan ko sadame main daal diya
 During the recent instability in Kashmir, Modi gave a signal to Pakistan, which started a major international campaign against India, that they are ready to fight this war inside Pakistan's land
 laal kile kii pracheer se modi ne kaha, ''aaj main kuch logon kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chaahunga or unhen mubaarakabaad dena chaahunga
 During the last few days, the people of Balochistan, gilgit-baltistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir have sent me greetings and gratitude
 jo log itani dur rah rahe hai, jinhen maine kabhi dekha nahin, jinase main kabhi mila nahin—un logon ne bharat ke pradhanmantri ke prati, 125 karod deshavaasiyon ke prati saraahna vyakt kii he
 It is a matter of honor for the people of our country
 ''modi kaa saahasik daanvmodi ke liye pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir kaa zikr saamaanya baat thi kyonki bharat hameshaa se hi gilgit-blatistan par apane daawey ko ''bantwaare ke adhure kaam'' ke rup main baratata rahaa he
 With this, however, Islamabad was aggravated due to the addition of concerns of the people of Balochistan province and some countries around the world were shocked
 isaki ek jaahir vajah aazaadee kii maang kar rahe pradarshnakariyon par kiye gaye pakistani fouj ke kathith maanavadhikaar ulanghan rahe honge
 This, however, was deemed to be more than a retaliation by Pakistan's accusations of Indian security forces 'vandalism' in the Kashmir Valley
 modi spasht taur par pakistan ko chetavanee de rahe the ki bharat ab baatcheet kii maujuuda sthiti se apana paksh badal rahaa he or aakraamak raksha kii mudra main aa chukaa he
 He meant that India could also be tough if it needed it
 iskaa nihitarth yah nikalataa he ki bharat ne ab faisla kar liya he ki aatanki samoohon or hamalon ko shah dena ab pakistan ke liye mahangaa sauda sabit hoga
 By saying this, the Indian Prime Minister has directly challenged the Pakistani army, especially its chief Raheel Sharif
 pakistani fouj ne pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke bharat ke saath sambandhon ko sudhaarney kii koshishon main adnga atakaya tha or mana jaataa he ki is janvari main pathankot vaayu sena adde par hamalaa bhi usee ne karavaaya tha
 India is now indicating that it is keen to spread instability in Pakistani areas far away from the Line of Control
 aisa karke modi ne ek aisa saahasik daanv khelaa he, jo jokhimon se bharaa padaa he
 Questions were raised whether India did this strategically so that the world's attention could be diverted from the ongoing unrest in Kashmir
 yah bhi poocha gaya ki kya modi ne china or pakistan, donon se ek saath nipatane kii sochi he, kyonki yah kadam baluchistan main china ke ahm hiton ko bhi chunauti detaa he
 Many more concerns were expressed: How can India expect the world to take action against the betrayal of Pakistan when it itself appears to be supporting the separatists? Will India lose its high moral position in the war against terror by expressing its interest in Balochistan? It also raised the question that if Pakistan in turn attacked Indian bases, is India willing to respond to it firmly and can it afford a nuclear war? The ups and downs Have tried everything from harmony to badjubani in an attempt to restore the relationship with them
 vipakshi dalon ne modi par pakistan ke maamle main ''anaap-shanaap'' niti apnaane kaa aarope lagaaya he jo vaise bhi majboot nahin he or jiske paas koi dirghakaalik ranneeti nahin he
 Those supporting Modi are quoting Churchill that "only donkeys live in harmony"
 ek aalaa adhikari kehete hai, ''doosraa jo kar rahaa he, aap usase apni aankh nahin munde rah sakate
 If the situation in Pakistan is changing rapidly, how will your policy not change? If Pakistan is not stable then how can we live? Modi is credited that he had invited Nawaz Sharif along with other South Asian leaders at his swearing-in ceremony in May 2014, giving preference to his neighbors
 videsh sachiv str kii vaarta taal die jane ke baad haalanki maahaul badal gaya jab bharat ne pakistan par hurriyat card khilne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Thereafter, a meeting between Modi and Sharif in Ufa, Russia that same year created a ray of hope, but it soon disappeared in the twilight when the proposed talks between the national security advisors of the two countries had to be canceled because Sartaj Aziz came to Delhi and wanted to meet Hurriyat leaders
 bharat kaa paksh saaf tha ki pakistan ke saath vaarta main kisi tisare paksh ko shaamil nahin kiya jayega or islamabad ne agar nafarmani kii to baatcheet taal di jaaegi
 Things changed again when Modi met Sharif during the Climate Change Conference in Paris in November 2015
 kuch hafton ke bheetar achaanak bada badlaav aayaa jab videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne islamabad main apane pakistani samakaksh sartaaj ajij ke saath elaan kiya ki donon desh samgr dwipaksheeya samvaad ko dobaaraa shuru karne par raji ho gaye hai
 The word 'bilateral' was added to it at India's insistence to ensure that the Hurriyat had no role in the negotiations
 mumbai hamalon ke baad is vaarta ko band kar diya gaya tha or saat saal baad iske dobaaraa shuru hone kaa yah elaan tha
 After this, Modi suddenly landed in Lahore on Christmas day and congratulated Sharif on his birthday
 har kisi ke chehre par muskaan thi, lekin hakrate bhar baad hue pathankot hamale ne sab nasht kar diya
 The terror attack at the Pathankot Air Force Base killed eight Indians, including seven security personnel
 chaar hamalavar bhi maare gaye the
 Pakistan did not deny that the attackers were carrying out the attack from its ground and blamed jaish-e-mohammed (JEM) for it
 bharat ke die dastavejon ke aadhaar par sharif ne to gujranvala main ek exiar bhi darj karvaa di thi
 After this, India approved a joint investigation team of Pakistan in 2016 to come to Pathankot and gather evidence of the case
 yah bhi modi kii hi pahal thi
 After this, however, when India demanded that the investigation team here go to Gujranwala and interrogate the arrested people, Pakistan cooled down on this demand
 pakistani ucchayukta abdul basit ne bharat par aarope lagaaya ki usne jeity ke daure se apusht nishkarshon ko li karke sharif ko sharmasaar kiya he or gopneeyata ko todaa he
 He also claimed that there was no provision for India's demand in return
 bharat ne isse yah nishkarsh nikaala ki donon sharifon ke bich satta kii jabardast jang chal rahi he, jisane behatar rishton kii jameen ko darka diya he
 India's assessment later turned out to be correct
 sharif banaam sharifprail ke ant main panama kii ek lau form ke panama papers li hue jisamen 1
 1 crore papers were included
 isamen duniya bhar main kai netaaon or kaarobaariyon ke bich rishton kaa khulaasa hua tathaa benami companiyon or khaaton ke swaamitv ke vivaran bhi saamne aae
 The news was not good for Nawaz Sharif as it was revealed in the documents that his three children had ownership of foreign companies which was not reflected in the declared assets of their family
 sharif rakshaatmak mudra main aa gaye
 He denied the charge and asked a retired judge to get it investigated, but the opposition rejected the proposal
 fouj ke mukhiya raahil sharif ne mauka tadte hue kah daalaa ki aatankwaad par tab tak lagaam nahin lagaai ja sakati jab tak 'bhrashtachar ke khatre' ko samaapt na kar diya jaae
 Raheel Sharif suddenly became popular after the success of the zarb-e-azb military campaign launched to wipe out the Taliban from North Waziristan and Swat areas
 unhen sindh ko aatankwaadiyon se khaali karaane kaa shrey mila tha or karachi main bhi unhone kanoon-vyavastha lagu kii thi
 Raheel is due to retire this November and during the last few months there has been much speculation as to whether Nawaz Sharif's government will be forced to extend him
 donon ke bich satta kii khinchataan ne bharat ke saath pakistan ke rishton par asar daalaa he, kyonki modi kii ore navaj sharif ke 'lacheelepan' ko paak fouj ke mukhiya bardaasht nahin karte
 This tension began to appear on the loc only when the Indian Army increased its infiltration efforts and reported the terrorist groups sending money from across the border
 is dauraan china ne pichley saal ghoshit 46 arab dollar vaali china-pakistan aarthik galiyara (sipiisi) pariyojna par kaam shuru kar diya tha
 China is planning to build a highway under this project being called 'gamechanger' which will cross the entire pok from Kashgar in China to gilgit-baltistan and reach Gwadar in Balochistan at the mouth of the Persian Gulf
 yojana main urja sanyantr lagaana shaamil he jisase pakistan ke grid main 10,400 megawatt kaa ijapha hoga or vahaan bijli kaa sankat hal hoga
 India opposed China's plan saying it was building a highway in the disputed area of pok
 udhar, raahil ne china jaakar ek sauda kiya, taaki samoochee pariyojna ko fouj kaa sangrakshan mil sake (dekhen saath kii report)
 Under the rule of the most powerful President Xi Jinping so far, China has also started speaking out on international issues
 bharat ko iskaa andaja tab laga jab china ne parmaanu aapurtikarta samooh (enesji) kii sadsyta ke masale par khulkar pakistan kaa samarthan kiya or bharat ke daawey ke khilaaf mat diya
 In addition, China also blocked an exercise to impose sanctions against Masood Azhar, the head of the JEM at the UN Security Council
 china ke is samarthan se majboot hokar pakistan ek baar phir nae utsaah se kashmir ke aantarik maamalon main dakhal dene laga
 What could have been happier for Pakistan was that Kashmir started to go out of control due to India's internal disagreements
 kashmir kaa uksaavajab piples democratic party (pidipi) or bijepi ne janvari 2015 main aitihaasik gathjod karte hue saajha sarkaar banaai or mufti mohammad said jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri bane, to yah pakistan ko raas nahin aayaa
 It hoped to exploit the hung mandate in the assembly elections, but Pakistan's plans were dashed by the coming together of the Hindu right-wing BJP and the PDP, which is soft on separatism

 It was just three months before she became the first woman Chief Minister of the state that the security forces killed Burhan Muzaffar Wani in an encounter in Kokernag on 8 July
 use ghati main fail rahe ugravad ke nae daur kaa cheharaa mana jaataa tha, haalanki soshal media ke vyapak istemaal ke kaaran surakshabal or police use 'virtual tiger' maanate the
 The state government and the central government had no idea what the reaction would be after this
 vaani ke janaaje ke liye sarkaar ne paryaapt suraksha ke intjaam nahin kiye, pratikriyaaon ko halke main liya, jiske kaaran uski antim yatra main baari bheed juty or iske baad pradarshnon kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 The killing of Wani fueled seething discontent among the youth of the valley
 uske baad se surakshabalon ke saath hue takaraavon main ab tak 68 se zyada logon kii jaan ja chuki he or ghati ke kuch hisson main dedh maheene se zyada samay se kafaru laga hua he
 Although the initial rise was mostly spontaneous, Pakistan later exploited the opportunity to wake up its dormant elements hidden in the valley to add fuel to the fire
 usne saath hi kashmir par ek antarrashtriya dushprachaar abhiyaan shuru kiya
 Nawaz Sharif, who till now had been restrained in the matter of statements made on India, started joking under pressure and said that "becoming the voice of Kashmir" is "binding" for him
 hadabadi main unhone sanyukt raashtra ke mahasachiv or sanyukt raashtra main maanavadhikaron ke ucchayukta ko patr bhej daalaa jisamen aagrah kiya ki 'maanavadhikaron ke nirantar or jabardast ulanghan' ko samaapt karne ke liye ve dakhal den
 One of the reasons for this exercise was the elections in pok i
e
 the so-called 'azad' Jammu and Kashmir, which were held only last month and where the PML (N) of Sharif's party won by a majority
 is dauraan halaat ko niyantran main laane ke liye modi ne teji se kadam badaye

 Modi and his team were angry at Pakistan's demand that a meeting of foreign secretaries be held to discuss the internal situation in Kashmir
 saarc sammelan ke liye islamabad gaye rajnath singh ke saath bhi badasluki kii gai
 Apart from this, there was a lot of uproar in the arrest of any Kulbhushan Jadhav in Balochistan who was accused of being an Indian spy and Pakistan did not let him contact the consulate
 itnaa kuch ghatane ke baad tab kahin jaakar khataron ke khilaadi modi ne hamalavar mudra apanaai or baluchistan kaa pasa phenk diya
 Why Balochistan? This is because in addition to being Pakistan's largest and most backward province, Balochistan provides a strategic route to West Asia and Central Asia

 In addition, China has leased mines there to exploit the huge gold and copper deposits there
 china kii mahatvakankshi sipiisi pariyojna kaa adhiktar hissaa baluchistan main sthit he jo ise nirnaayak ahmiyat pradaan karata he
 Balochistan has been a constant pain for Pakistan
 afghanistan or iran ke saath uski sarhad 2,500 kilometre lambii he jo seemapar aatankwaad or tanaav kaa garh rahi he
 Since the merger with Pakistan in 1948, the Baloch people have intermittently waged a struggle for autonomy and independence, which the Pakistani security forces have brutally crushed
 islamabad lagaataar bharat kii jasusi sanstha ro par vahaan asthirataa failaane kaa aarope lagaataa rahaa he
 However he could never give concrete evidence
 pradhanmantri rahete hue manmohan singh ne jab 2009 main shame-al-shaikh main pakistani samakaksh yusuf raja gilaani ke saath jari sanyukt bayaan main baluchistan kaa zikr karne kii anumati di thi, tab bijepi ke netaaon ne is 'blendar' ke liye unhen aade haathon lete hue kaha tha ki ''saat samundar kaa pani bhi is shame ko dho nahin paaegaa
 The move was seen as an acknowledgment of India's intervention in Pakistan's internal affairs and forced Manmohan to step back
 manmohan ke liye aaj yah kaaphi kshtprad hoga ki jis baluchistan ko mej par laane ke liye un par bujdil hone kaa aarope laga, usee par bayanon ke liye aaj modi ko saahsee tehraaya ja rahaa he
 Modi's supporters dismiss criticism of duplicity over Balochistan
 ek aalaa adhikari kaa kahana tha ki manmohan ne jab baluchistan kaa zikr kiya, to vah pakistan ke bharat par lagaae is aarope par rakshaatmak pratikriya thi, jabaki modi ne pakistan par baluchistan main maanavadhikaar ulanghan kaa aarope lagaaya he
 To Pakistan's criticism that India crossed the border by referring to Balochistan, India's State Department spokesman Vikas Swarup replied, "pakistan does not recognize any boundaries in its diplomacy
" aaj seemapar aatankwaad or ghuspaith kaa uskaa record hi is kshetra kii samasya kii jad main he
 He also indicated that India has raised the issue of human rights violations there many times in the past

 He supported the Khalistan movement and has also been behind the terrorist attacks in Mumbai and Pathankot
 adhikari kehete hai, ''agar ve niyam se nahin khel rahe, to ham kyon khelen? '' pakistan kii ghabrahat kaa kaaran rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal hai jo aakraamak raksha ke maharathi hai or barason pehle unhone chetavanee jari kii thi, ''ek baar or tumne mumbai jaisaa kuch kiya to baluchistan haath se chalaa jayega
 "the challenges ahead" The path of reconciliation between the two countries is becoming increasingly narrow
 pakistan ne puure desh main kaaryakartaaon ko uksaa diya he ki ve modi kaa putala jalaaen jisase baluchistan ke liye rashtravaadi samarthan ko jutaya ja sake
 Pakistan officials accuse Modi and the RSS of creating divisions to win the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab
 pakistan ke ek afasar ne kaha ki bharat agar sochataa he ki vah baluchistan yaa gilgitat-blatistan ko asthir kar paaegaa, to vah gafalat main he
 Modi and his team believe that the world is not going to break its legs in Kashmir
 nise, brusselles or paris ke hamalon ke baad duniya main un aatankiyon ke prati koi sahanubhuti nahin he jo aazaadee ke ladaakon kaa chola pahane hai
 An officer says, "if Burhan Wani had been here, would he have tolerated it?" Anyway, Kashmir between India and Pakistan is like a Ranji match, not an Ashes - so Pakistan will not benefit
 '' kashmir main aage kya kiya janaa he, is masale par pradhanmantri ne samooche rajnatik tantra ko badi samajhadaari ke saath saath liya he
 He has taken note of the request of former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah that all political forces be taken together to find a 'permanent solution'
 baluchistan kaa naam lekar modi ne ek to kashmir par pakistan ke hamale kaa munhtod jawaab diya he, duusare ek kade jawaab ke intjaar main baithi janata kii bahupratikshit maang ko puraa kiya he
 Its strategic utility however is limited

 If China starts to unravel soon, it will be difficult for India to handle two enemies on its outskirts
 modi ko isiilie apni manshaa ke saath-saath karrwai bhi jari rakhni hogi
 They have to prepare an organized plan for this and follow it very carefully
 modi ne dikhaaya he ki ve mukt hokar sochane kii kshamta rakhte hai, lekin unhen bas iskaa dhyaan rakhana he ki ve kahin apane hi kiye-dhare ke boj tale dab na jaaen

 The entire opposition, including Congress, has called for the Bharat Bandh against the record price increase of petrol in the country
 isabharat bandki aguwai congress party kar rahi he, jiske saath kareeb 20 raajnneetik partiyon kaa samarthan he
 The party chief of the same Sena Uddhav Thackeray has made a sharp attack on BJP in the mouthpiece of the party
 saath hi unhone vipakshi dal kaa boj uthaane kii baat bhi kahi
 Significantly, Shiv Sena is not involved in today's bandh
 saamana main uddhav ne likhaa ki congress sahit kuch virdohi dalon ne hindustan band kaa elaan kiya he
 The way inflation has increased across the country, it is closed to create awareness among the public, according to the opponents
 deshbhar ke kai kshetreey dal isamen shaamil ho rahe hai isliye yah band kuch had tak nishchit hi safal hoga
 It should be so
 rashtriya janata dal, bahujan samaaj party jaise dal is band main utre hai
 Therefore, 100 percent impact of the bandh will be seen in North India
 party pramukh ke mutabik, band kii ghoshnaa raajnneetik kaarnon se nahin balki janajivan se sambandhit mahangaai par dhyaan aakarshith karne ke liye he
 Whether or not the alliance of the opposing parties is properly tied up on the public's questions, it will surely become clear on the pretext of this bandh
 thakare ne kaha ki janata rojaanaa mahangaai kii aanch bardaasht kar rahi he
 Now it is not burning, but the public is burning in the fire of inflation
 chita jalaane ke liye jis tarah aag kii jarurat hoti he, yah aag waisi hi he or janata ko jalaakar maarane ke liye hi mahangaai kii aag lagaai gai he
 That is why the fire is not awakened by this fire and they wake up, so it is 'closed', it is beyond comprehension
 janata jaag rahi he
 It will burn Lanka in 2019 by the rulers
 uddhav kaa aaropee he ki modi kii sarkaar sabhi staron par fail ho chuki he, aisa virodhiyon ne kaha he
 We do not know about others, but inflation has left the public naked
 is sthiti main janata jiye kaise?shivasena pramukh ne aage likhaa ki maharashtra ke mantri chandrakant patil kaa kahana he 'ek din bhaajapa kaa netaa banakar dikhaao, phir sarkaar chalaanaa kitna mushkil he ye pataa chalegaa
 'we have to say to the Patil that money is coming from the government and the BJP from all sides
 usee par chunaav lade ja rahe hai
 We say it is easy to be a BJP leader
 ek din jhulasati hui aam janata kaa jivan jikar dikhaaen, yah sambhav he kya? aam janata kii kismat main in dinon sadakon main gaddhon ke saath hi pet main bhi gaddha ho gaya he
 Opposition parties have announced a shutdown, so do you lick fingers in their name? The government could not overcome the farmers' crisis
 2014 main modi ne aashwaasan diya tha ki desh main do karod naukariyaan harsaal yuvakon ko milengi, lekin hua ulta hi
 20 lakh jobs have been reduced every year
 yuvaaon ko kaam nahin
 Housewives do not have LPG rindhan kaa bhav roj bad rahaa he
 You make publicity of growth rate
 rindhan ke badhate daamon kaa bhi sarkari poster lagaao
 Thackeray further wrote that Rahul Gandhi is a non-vegetarian, so those who speak should speak on inflation
 badhati mahangaai par or jhulasati janata par bhaajapa netaa kab bolenge? 2019 main vipaksh main baithne par nae band kaa elaan kar ve mahangaai par bolanewaale hai kya? mahangaai kaa sawaal janata kii jindagi or maut kaa sawaal ban gaya he
 The one who understood this was the ruling
 desh ke 22 rajyon main bhaajapa kii sarkarein hai
 The BJP may reduce the price of petrol and diesel, but the central government has made a profit of about two lakh 29 thousand crores from the business of petrol and diesel
 yah paisa janata kaa khun chuskar kamaaya gaya he
 How will this exploitation stop? The public is awake, but the sleeping opposition is now awake and they have announced a shutdown
 band main shivasena kyon shaamil nahin ho rahi, ye sawaal ab poocha jayega
 We have sympathy for the scorched people in inflation
 ham janata kii samasyaayein hameshaa hi rakhte aae hai
 By becoming the voice of the public, we created a furore in the government
 vipakshi dal kaa boj aaj tak ham hi uthaa rahe the
 Now we have to see the power of the opposing party
 desh main loktantr he
 If the opposition party keeping the sentiments of the people is working effectively, then the state and the country have an interest in it
 virdohi dalon ke badbadaanewaalon ko bhi yah pataa chalane do ki ve nishchit taur par kahaan hai? janata ke liye kiya gaya band haal hi main sokar uthe logon kaa band na sabit ho

 co / spqzsfhlab Who is the native of Uttarakhand? This dispute has been going on since the formation of this state
 pichley dinon pradesh kii sansadeey kaarymantri indira hridayesh ne yah bayaan dekar ek baar phir ise hawa de di ki rajya ke gathan ke samay uttarakhand main rah rahe log hi yahaan ke mul nivasee maane jaaenge
 In response to the question of BJP MLA Adesh Chauhan from Haridwar, Indira Hridayesh said in the House that all the people who had settled in the state till November 9, 2000, would be considered as natives of the state
 is ghoshnaa se rajya gathan ke samay tak duusare pradeshon se aakar rajya ke maidani jilon main based lakhon logon ko ab sarkari naukariyaan paane or aarakshan kaa laabh lene kaa rasta mil gaya he
 This is the root of the controversy
 ek dashak se chal rahe virodh or samarthan ke baavjood ab tak ain chaar sarkarein is mudde par koi faisla nahin kar pain
 On September 17, 2012, a single bench of Uttarakhand High Court Judge Sudhanshu Dhulia passed judgment on more than half a dozen individual petitions filed in the matter of domicile and caste evidence, stating that the people living here till the time of state formation were allowed to stay here
 To be considered a native
 aadesh main saaf kiya gaya he ki sanvaidhanik aadesh 1950 ke tahat jin jatiyon ko essi / asti / obisi kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya he, agar ve rajya gathan se purv uttarakhand main based hai to unhen rajya kii kisi bhi suvidha se vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The natives do not mean that the ancestors whose ancestral geographical area resides in Uttarakhand will be the natives here, rather it refers to the people settled in the whole of Uttar Pradesh in 1950 at the time of the first presidential order
 adaalat ke aadesh or mantri kii ghoshnaa ke baad rajnatik dal or andolankaaree sanghathan bhadak gaye hai
 At the same time, millions of people settled in Dehradun, Haridwar, Udham Singh Nagar and Nainital are feeling relief from this decision during the last three decades
 sabase badi raahat to un chaatro ko mili he, jinka janm or padhai uttarakhand main hui lekin ve pratiyogi pariksha main bhaag lene se sirf isliye vanchit rahe kyonki unke paas jati or sthaayee nivas pramaan patr nahin tha
 Many such students like Manisha Bharti, Jyotsna were also deprived of it, who had to fight till the High Court to get caste certificate
 sarkaar kii is ghoshnaa se gussaye rajnatik dal or sanghathan sadakon par andolan kar rahe hai
 The UKD (P) fasted outside the Legislative Assembly on 13 December and sieged the MLA residence from 16 to 24 December against the government's order
 eukedy (pi) ke adhyaksh trivendra ngkshasah panvar kehete hai, ''sabhi rajyon ke liye mul nivasee hone kii seemaa varsh 1950 tay he, lekin sarkaar ne yah seemaa 2000 kar di
 It is unheard of by the original natives of the state
 '' eukedy ne bhaajapa-congress vidhayakon ko gherkar is mudde ko sadan main uthaane kaa vaayada bhi liya he
 Many bjp-congress leaders are joining the agitators on this issue
 bhaajapa netaa or rajya andolankaaree sammaan parishad ke purv upaadhyaksh rabindra jugran kehete hai, ''sarkaar ne yah faisla bilderon, bhu mafia, sharaab or khanan mafia ko balldor se phayda pahunchane ke liye kiya he
 "the bjp-congress mlas from the plains districts are happy with the government's announcement and court order, while the mlas from the hill districts are against the decision
" donon partiyaan saaf -saaf kuch bhi kehane se batch rahi hai
 Despite this, where BJP spokesperson Satish Lakheda said that the government should take a decision according to the concept of state formation, BJP MLA Adesh Chauhan from Haridwar said that this decision should have taken place earlier
 purv sansadeey kaarymantri or bhaajapa netaa prakaash pant ne mul nivas ke mudde par ho rahi raajnneeti ko pradesh ko baantne vaala kadam qaraar diya
 Pant, "during the bill presented in Parliament for the formation of the state, the decision on the cut-off date for the natives in the state could not be done
 '' vahiin indira hridayesh kahati hai ki rajya main paidaa hue or bade sabhi bachche pramaan patr paane ke hakdaar hai
 The verdict is also being welcomed with protest
 uttaranchal sanyukt sarv samaaj ke pradesh adhyaksh kunwar japendrr singh kehete hai, ''is faisle kaa virodh uttarakhand ke vikaas kaa virodh he
 Congress leader Dhirendra Pratap says that while fixing the cut-off date at the original residence, the government should respect the sentiment of the agitators

 AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal's blistering victory in the Delhi Assembly elections is affecting the students of IIT Kharagpur and they are also considering the option of politics as a career
 kejariwal ne bhi isi santhaan se padhai kii he
 Atal Ashutosh Aggarwal, a third year student of mechanical engineering at IIT Kharagpur, said, "after graduating from IIT, politics is one of the options before me
 kejariwal ne sabit kar diya he ki iaiti or ejineering prishthbhumi ke log bhi raajnneeti main safal ho sakate hai
 Aggarwal, a resident of Delhi, had a tendency towards politics when he saw an IIT alumnus (kejriwal) fighting against corruption along with social activist Anna Hazare
 pehle hi aam aadmi party (aap) main shaamil ho chuke agarwal ne kaha, ‘‘kejariwal ne hamaare liye raajnneeti main pravesh aasaan bana diya he
 He has shown us a path and he is an inspiration
 ’’ Lokesh Deshmukh, a second-year student of Geophysics, who helped AAP in online and phone campaigning in the Delhi Assembly elections, said that the number of students joining the party from top engineering institutes as volunteers was increasing
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yah sab kejariwal kii vajah se he kyonki santhaan parisar main har kisi ke man main unke prati khaas lagaav he kyonki vah hamaare bich se hai
 '' fasebuk par saikadon yuva iitian raajnneetik ghatnakramon or party se sambandhit muddon par charchaa ke liye community pej ‘aap iaiti khadgpur’ par ekajute hue hai
 More than 20 thousand 'likes' have already appeared on the page
 iaiti parisar main vaise raajnneeti varjit he kyonki andar raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko anumati nahin he
 Kejriwal did mechanical engineering from IIT Kharagpur
 vah iske nehru haul hostel main paanch saal rahe jise saamaajik evam saanskrithik gatividhiyon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Aggarwal said, "he used to regularly attend meetings of Hindi Dramatics Society and was active in organizing events related to public dialogue, debates etc
 isse unhen acchhee vakpatutaa mili, jo ab raajnneetik duniya main unki madad kar rahi he
 '' santhaan ke purv nideshak evam kejariwal ko padhaa chuke professor shankar kumaar shom ne kaha santhaan main samgr shiksha uplabdh karai jaati he jisase chaatr har kshetra main safalataa ke shikhar choote hai
 He said, "after passing out, they can pursue whatever career they want
 ’’ Taking a major decision just before the Lok Sabha elections, BSP supremo Mayawati expelled former cabinet minister Nandagopal Gupta 'nandi' and his wife Allahabad Mayor Abhilasha Gupta from the party
 party se nikaale jane kaa kaaran unka party virdohi gatividhiyon main shaamil hona bataaya gaya he
 On the other hand, Nandi termed the allegations as baseless and termed it as a conspiracy of BSP candidate Keshari Devi Patel from Allahabad
 bispi ke varisht netaa ashok vaajapeyi va unke putr harshavardhan vaajapeyi ke baad ab purv mantri nandi va unki patni abhilaashaa ko party se baahar kiya gaya he
 bsp's Zonal Coordinator Drs
 vijay pratap kaa kahana he ki nandi va unki meyar patni abhilaashaa gupta kaaphi samay se party virdohi gatividhiyon main shaamil the
 The party leadership warned him several times, but he did not improve his attitude
 is bare main abhilaashaa gupta kahana he ki unhone bispi kii sadsyta hi nahin lee thi
 He contested the election of the mayor of Allahabad as an independent, so there is no point in being expelled from the BSP

 On the other hand, Devyani has gained recognition after her transfer to the United Nations
 neuyark main 12 disambar ko giraftaar kiye jane or jamaanat par reeha hone ke baad devayani ko purna rajanyik chhot pradaan karne ke liye sarkaar ne unka tabadalaa sanyukt raashtra main bharat ke mishan main kar diya tha
 After the recognition of his appointment there is likely to be some paperwork in the US State Department for which India has already handed over the papers
 isi ke saath, adaalat main nijee peshi se chhot ko unki giraftaar or vastra utaravakar kii gayi talaashi se utpann gatirodh dur karne kii disha main ek ahm kadam mana ja rahaa he
 The Indian government reacted strongly to the misconduct with Devyani and India is pressuring the US to drop unconditional charges against her

 The water of the Ganges has been described as nectar in the scriptures and it is true that the herbs and medicinal trees that touch the Ganges water comes down from it, the Ganges water really becomes nectar
 unhone kaha ki ganga ke jal ko puure vishwa main failaane ke liye isaki bottling kiye jane kii bhi yojana banaai ja rahi he or gleshyir se nikle jal ko sidhe hi bottle main bharaa jaayegaa
 With the aim of spreading the Ganges to the world, the Ganges water was flowing with great reverence by the Prime Minister of Mauritius Naveen Ramgoolam in the 'ganga Talab' of his country, after which the people present there believed that the Ganges would now have other Parts should also be taken

 -input IANS In recent times, veteran wicketkeeper batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni has been criticized for his form, but Indian vice-captain Rohit Sharma on Thursday supported him saying that he will play an important role during the World Cup
 rohit ne kaha ki dhoni kii match ‘finnish’ karne kii kaabiliyat ke alaava unki maujuudagi hi team main sukun kaa ahsaas karaati he, visheshkar yuvaaon ko or world cap jaise bade tunament main yah kaaphi ahm hoga
 Rohit said ahead of the opening ODI against Australia on Saturday, 'over the years we have seen how Dhoni's presence is in the dressing room and on the field
 unke aasapaas hone se group main ek shanti kaa ahsaas hota he, jo kaaphi ahm hota he or saath hi thodi madad captain kii bhi kyonki vah stump kii peeche khadaa hota he
 'the influence that is @ msdhoniin vice-captain @ imro45's words # teamindia # ausvindpic
 twitter
 com / urhnelreer— BCCI (@BCCI) January 10, 2019 The COA recommended a ban on pandya-rahul for obscene remarks, Rohit said, 'he has captained the Indian team for so many years and has been very successful
 isliye team main unka aasapaas hona hameshaa madadgaar hota he
 He is like a guide in the group
 ’ dhoni kii charchit phinishing kaabiliyat kii aalochana kii ja rahi he, lekin rohit ne kaha ki purv captain ab bhi balle se kaaphi yogadan karne main sakasham he
 Rohit said, "batting in the lower order, getting us closer to the score, his 'finishing touch' is very important and he has finished so many matches for us on the win
 unka sanyam or salaah, khel ke bare main unki soch or hamen kya karnaa chahie, yah sab is samay kaaphi ahm hai
 The 31-year-old batsman said, 'his presence in the group is a very important factor for us
 ’ Like the year passed, now the year 2016 also stands at the threshold of farewell
 nai ummiido or nai umangonke saath ham sabaki jindagi main ek baar phir se;nayaa saal dastak dene vaala he
 But before that it is important that we explore this passing year also
 jaruri he ki ham jurm kii duniya kii;un tasveeron ko dekhen jo puure saal tak hamen kachotati rahi
 But when we turn the calendar backwards, every month of the year, we see only one face of terror
 cheharaa bagdadi kaa or maut baantne ke uske jaalim tareeke kaa
 The craze of creating a caliphate against terror made this human being so dreadful that now even fear has started to be feared by it
 saal 2016 main iraq or syria kii retili zamin se hote hue maut itane khaufnak tareeke duniya tak pahunche, jitne na kabhi dekhe gaye or na kabhi soche gaye
 Baghdadi is a living effigy of horror and suffering in the world
 iske ishaare par pichley dhai saalon se anginat log maut ke ghat utaare ja chuke hai, lekin maut, maut main bhi fark hota he
 The death that Baghdadi gives to its enemies is beyond human thought
 bagdadi ke 10 chehre yani maut ke 10 tareekabagdadi kaa cheharaa number-1-sir kalam19 june, 2016, raka, syria, iesas ke julmo-sitam ke itihaas main ye shaayad ab tak kaa sabase kaala din tha, kyonki is roj iesas ne mahaz chaar saal kii ek bacchee kaa sir kalam kar diya
 Although there is no hope for isis's suffering, but what could have been the reason behind the beheading of such a small girl? So the answer is, his mother should swear in the name of Allah
 phool si bacchee wo is manahuus tarikh ko apni maa ke saath ghar se baahar nikal ai thi
 His mother wanted to send him home, but was not ready
 wo jid karne lagi
 Then the mother angrily swore by Allah that if she did not go home, she would cut off her head
 bas, itani si baat aatankwaadiyon ke kaanon main pad gai
 Then the terrorists asked the mother to cut the head of the child, but when she did not agree to it, the terrorists themselves cut the head of the girl and shaken her mother's hands with her blood
 darasal iesas apni shuruyaat se hi dushmano kaa sir kalam karata rahaa he
 Or rather it is his favorite way to kill enemies
 iesas ne 25 july 2014 ko jab pehali baar ek saath 75 syrian phogiyon kaa sir kalam kiya tha, to duniya chaunk gai thi
 After this, he beheaded exactly how many people, no one has the exact account of it
 alabatta british or america bandhakon ko camere ke saamne iesas ke jallaadon kaa shikaar banate duniya ne kai baar dekha or ye silsilaa ab bhi jari he
 Baghdadi's face number-2, shot in the head by shooting someone in the head with his knees on the ground, how horrible it can be, ISIS showed the world
 darindagi kii sari hadon se aage nikal kar is aatankwaadi sanghathan ne namaaloom kitnon ko aise hi sir main goli maar kar maut ke ghat utaar diya or apane dushmano ke saath uskaa ye suluk ab bhi chal rahaa he
 But in some of its propaganda videos, ISIS has crossed all limits
 iesas ke aatankwaadi ab tak khud apane shikaar logon goli maaraa karte the, lekin ab usne ye kaam maasoom bacchon se bhi karana shuru kar diya
 Yes, ISIS started shooting its enemies by shooting innocent children in the name of Cubs of Khalifet, the cubs of Khilafat
 vaise to iesas ke kaanoon kii qitabon main har gunaah ke liye apni alag sazaa he
 But usually those caught in espionage crime give such death
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number -3upar se phenk kar maarnafrj kiijie kisi shaks ke haath paanv bediyon main jakade hai
 He is surrounded by shadows of bayonets, and even if he runs away, he cannot even breathe on his own
 use usee haalat main kisi imaarat kii sabase upree manzil par le jaaya jaataa he
 Then, after telling the story of his crimes by profiteering among the people standing under the building, he is pushed straight down from above
 ye ek aisa manzar he, jiske bare main soch kar hi rongte khadey ho jate hai
 But being gay under the rule of ISIS is a crime for which this is the only death
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number -4sangsar kar maaranasangsar karnaa yani pattharon se kuchal kar jaan lenaa
 Can some humans crush the lives of people like themselves with stones? It is difficult for you to think, even today, in many hardline Muslim countries, doing so is within the scope of law
 phir iesas to nafrat or kattarpan kii sari hadon se aage he
 Therefore, ISIS has also often taken lives in such a painful manner
 vaise sangsar kaa shikaar aksar waisi mahilaayein zyaada hoti hai, jin par kisi se najayas rishton kaa ilzaam lagata he
 Baghdadi's face No
5 burnt in the fire The death of these Turkish soldiers imprisoned in Panjrera revived the dwindling terror of Baghdadi
 syria main turki ke dakhal se baukhalaaye bagdadi ne in sainikon ko maut dene se pehle pinjre main band kiya
 Kneeling like animals and then wrote such a speech of hagiography, which probably will not be forgotten so easily
 barood se bhari in pattiyon ko zanjiron ke zarie in tak pahunchaaya gaya or phir inhen usase jakad diya gaya
 There is no scope of escape in these chains of iron
 maut se pehle khauf ke har ek lamhe ko bagdadi ke gurgey camere par record kar rahe hai
 Due to fear, his throat has become so dry
 petrol main pehle hi nahalaae ja chuke in turki sainikon ko ek ishaara milte maut kii aag main jhonk diya gaya
 The black veneer Yamraj took out the remote of death
 ye remote darasal us barood kaa trigar he jo is lohe kii chen se guzarati hui inke jismon ko chhu rahi he
 The trigger was pressed and the gunpowder caught fire
 lamhaa lamhaa maut tezi se badhane lagi
 Life burnt to death in these flames
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-6boat main bithakar maarnataarikh main shaayad hi kisi jallaad ne maut ke itane tareeke nikaale ho jitne is ek saal main bagdadi ne apane gunahagaaron ko die, jo maut usne in 6 bandhakon ko di khuda kare waisi koi kisi ko na de
 These ISIS poachers have done many things to play this painful game of death
 ek ek kar inhen is safed boat main bithaaya gaya
 It is seen in the video that two hostages were already seated and these two terrorists are holding the remaining four hostages by the neck and taking them towards the boat
 do do ke jode main in bandhakon ko boat main bitha diya gaya
 
 sabake chehre par maut kaa khauf saaf nazar aa rahaa he
 They know that it is impossible to escape from here, but even the hostages of the bloodthirsty Baghdadi do not get death easily
 boat main baithe behad kam umr ke in ladakon ke dil main kitni dehshat hogi iskaa andaaza laga paanaa bhi mushkil he
 His hands and feet were tied first in the boat
 phir is boat ko pani ke bich main chhod diya gaya
 The boat floated in water, death kept coming closer
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-7pani main dubokar maaranalohe kaa pinjraa he jisase nikalnaa naammumkin he
 Small cage cameras
 isamen maut ke manjar ko ricard karenge ye krur aatanki
 One by one, 5 prisoners were sent to the cage wearing orange jumpsuits
 sabake chehron par maut kaa khauf he
 At that point, the crane brought this cage in the middle of the water and slowly the cage was started to sink into the water
 pinjadaa main pehle aadha or phir pani munh tak bharaa
 The pijada went underwater and when evacuated the mothers-in-law had stopped
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-8visphotak baandhakar maarnajasoosi ke iljaam main iesas ke panje main aae in saat logon ko usne aisi maut di ki puri duniya tharra gai he
 These pictures of the massacre are such that it is not possible to show them any face
 khule maidan main 7 logon ko bandi banaakar laayaa gaya
 The hands of all the prisoners were tied up and tied with blue explosive wire in their necks and then ended their life with a detonator blast
 ise dekhakar to shaayad bade se bada zaalim bhi tharra jaae
 Baghdadi's face flying in the number-9 car with explosions took the ISIS terrorists closer to death in this way
 haath bandhe hue
 Neck terrorists gripped
 ek ek karke is car main bithakar baandh gaya
 The car was locked from outside
 inhen yahaan se maut kaa safar tay karne ke liye akelaa chhod diya gaya
 Then a fully loaded mortar launcher appeared in the hands of a terrorist
 jiskaa nishaanaa car par tha
 After a gesture, the mortar went off and went straight into the car
 ek dhamaake ke saath car main baithe logon ke parakhche ud gaye
 Pictures of Baghdadi's face hanging on Maransulei hanging on the number-10 crucifix came much from the kingdom of terror
 lekin america jasuson ko is saal bagdadi ke aatankiyon ne jis tarah maaraa use haivaaniyat ko bhi lafzon main bayaan kar paanaa mushkil he
 The way the animal is hung after jibha in eating the butcher
 vaise hi in bandhakon ko latakaane ke liye aatankiyon ne pehle to inke haath baandhen or phir ek ek karke unhen ghasitkar us jagah laayaa gaya jahaan maut di gai
 They were then hung upside down
 is tarah khaufnak maut se har koi dahal uthaa

 Young women are also vulnerable to increasing cases of breast cancer
 aise main 3di mammography yuva mahilaon main stan cancer ko pakadaney main kargar tul ke rup main dekhi ja rahi he
 Consultant and oncologist of Max Institute of Cancer Care, Shalimar Bagh, New Delhi, on increasing cases of breast cancer
 vineet govind gupta kehete hai, 'stan cancer kyon ho rahaa he, iske kaarnon kaa haalanki abhi pataa nahin lag paaya he, lekin yah tay he ki jitani jaldi iskaa pataa lagaaya jaataa he, thik hone ke avasar utane hi bad jate hai
 He said that traditionally mammography is 2 dimensional, which shows the results on the film Black and White X-ray
 iske saath hi inhen computer screen par bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Many of the breastbreaking images in 3D mammograms are taken from different angles, to produce a clearer and greater dimension image
 is tarah ke mammogram kii jarurat isliye he, kyonki yuvavastha main yuvatiyon ke stan ke utak kaaphi ghaney hote hai or saamaanya mammogram main cancer ke gathan kaa pataa nahin lag paata he
 The image drawn from a 3D mammogram can also capture the lump of cancer hidden between the breast tissue
 dow
 Gupta explains that 3D mammograms have many more benefits, such as the main purpose of mammograms is to detect and treat breast cancer lumps as early as possible
 iske liye 3di imaging ko kaaphi kargar mana jaataa he
 He said that 3D mammograms have a lot of similarity between images and CT scanning and in this the patient has to face a much lower amount of radiation than conventional mammography
 dow
 Gupta says that women approaching 40 years of age have been advised to do mammography every year
 lekin ab unhen 3-di imaging technology kaa sahaara lenaa chahie
 Women of all ages can get the benefit of this technology, but if the lump of cancer gets caught in puberty, then by treating it effectively it can save valuable life
 darasal, 3di mammography karne kaa tarika bilkul 2di mammography kii hi tarah hota he
 In this, many pictures are taken from many angles by placing the breast of the woman between the Xplate and the tubehead
 is tarah kii tasveeron ko slices kaha jaataa he
 Photo slices of the breast are made with such a fine difference that even the smallest cancerous breast does not hide from his eyes and is exposed to the screen
