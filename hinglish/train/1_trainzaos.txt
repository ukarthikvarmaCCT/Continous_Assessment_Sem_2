 Book: mandate-will of the People (non-fiction - English) Publisher: Westland limitededition: Paperback, 137 pages: 195 rupees The famous journalist, columnist and writer Veer Sanghvi has written a book
 sheershak he, mandet- vil of da pipal
 Sanghvi has written many such things in it, which are new and shocking to the public
 masalan indira gandhi ke bete sanjay gandhi ko indra kumaar gujral ne dapatate hue kya kaha, ye khud gujral kii jubaani bataaya gaya he
 Apart from this, it has also been told that Sonia Gandhi had decided in 1999 that if the Congress comes to power, Manmohan will be the PM
 babari masjid vidhwans ke maamle main raashtrapati kaa ronaa ho yaa america main ilaaj ke dauraan ek mulaakaat ke baad newclear deal par amar singh or phir sapa kaa badla stand, sanghavi ne tamaam ahm raajnneetik ghatnakramon ke kai dilachasp or nae byore die hai
 As editor for decades in various establishments and close penetration in the corridors of power, Sanghvi also knew many things that had not gone public
 ye kitaab aisi kai baton ko saamne laati hai
 Here are five interesting political developments from the book
 
 1
 sanjay gandhi ko gujral kii do took, varishton se tameez se baat kijieimergency kaa daur
 Indra Kumar Gujral Minister of Information Broadcasting in Indira Government
 ek cabinet meeting ke baad indira gandhi ke suputr sanjay gandhi kaa gujral ko farmaan
 i want to see All India Radio's news bulletin before it airs
 gujral ne do took jawaab diya
 This is not possible
 main bhi prasaaran se pehle kabhi nahin dekhtaa
 Then Indira comes and avoids the thing, see it later
 phir kuch roj baad gujral ko pradhanmantri awaas main talab kiya jaataa he
 When he arrives, he finds that Indira has left for her office
 unke saamne sanjay gandhi khadey hai
 Sanjay warns Gujral, "look, this won't work
" gujral ne wo jawaab diya, jiske bare main indira cabinet kaa or koi mantri soch bhi nahin saktaa tha
 Gujral said, see here
 jab tak main hum aise hi chalegaa
 And you will learn how to talk to superiors
 gujral yaheen nahin ruke
 He said that i have no accountability towards you
 main aapaki mummy kii sarkaar main mantri hum
 Saying this, Gujral left and then he was asked to resign

 The Golden Temple of Amritsar in the shadow of the terror of Bhindranwale, Punjab 80s
 ek din punjab police ke diaiji attawal mandir jate hai
 Visit, get offerings
 vaapasi ke dauraan sidhiyon tak hi pahunch pate hai ki ek goli unke sharir ko bedh jaati he
 This bullet was fired by a terrorist of Bhindranwale's team
 jo mandir ke bagal ke guest house main apane bunker main ghaat lagaae baitha tha
 The sensation runs throughout the city, the whole state, the whole country
 sikhon ke is sabase pavitra ghar main is tarah kii harakat
 But shame was yet to set the scale
 police bal main bhindrawaale or uske gurgon kaa aisa khauf ki attawal kii laash bhi nahin uthaai ja saki
 His body remained on the stairs there for 24 hours
 phir amritsar kaa districtr magistrate bhindrawaale ke paas pahunchaa, gidgidaaya or tab usne attawal kii laash uthaane kii anumati di
 After this, the situation got worse and then the army carried out Operation Blue Star
 isamen bade paimaane par sainik, afasar, nirdosh tirthayatri, aatankwaadi or haa, bhindrawaale bhi maaraa gaya

 ro rahe the raashtrapati shankaradayal sharma6 disambar 1992, dopaher 12
 At 30 o'clock, the nation came to know that the insane kar sevaks had climbed a dome of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya to break it
 dilli sthit tamaam muslim netaa pradhanmantri daftar main phone karne lage
 With hopes of intervention
 magar har baar jawaab miltaa, pradhanmantri aaraam kar rahe hai
 2 in the afternoon
 30 baje kai netaa, samajasevi or dharmaguru raashtrapati shankaradayal sharma se milane pahunche
 Sharma was crying
 unhone aae hue logon ko ek khat dikhaaya
 Sharma wrote this letter to Prime Minister Narasimha Rao
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki ayodhya main sthiti visphotak he, rajya kii bijepi sarkaar kii sthiti saaf nahin he
 In such a situation, the state government should dismiss and take the security system in its hands
 phir sharma bole, magar main bhi pradhanmantri tak nahin pahunch paaya
 It is also necessary to remember here that Narasimha Rao got the Prime Minister's chair only after Shankar Dayal Sharma's refusal
 darasal tamilnadu ke shreeperambudur main rajeev gandhi kii littey ke aatmghaatee hamalavar daste ke haathon hatya ke baad party main har koi unki vidhwaa sonia gandhi se netritv kii ummid kar rahaa tha
 Everyone asked him to become Congress president
 us vakt yah saaf tha ki jo party sanbhaalega, vahi satta main aane par pradhanmantri banegaa
 Sonia flatly denied this
 magar nayaa adhyaksh unheen kii sahmati se banataa, yah saaf tha
 Sonia consulted PN Haksar, an old family partner and bureaucrat
 hakasar ne uparashtrapati shankaradayal sharma kaa naam sujhaayaa
 Sharma refused, citing his ill health
 tab baari ai narsimha raav kii
 By that time, Rao had made up his mind to retire from politics
 rajeev gandhi kii good book main vah the nahin
 The situation was such that his Rajya Sabha MP was also over
 jab vah hyderabad jane ko taiyaar the, tabhi sonia ne elaan kiya
 Alright, it's PV Den
 or narsimha raav ko pehle party or phir chunaav nattejey aane ke baad desh kii kaman mil gai

 mayawati ne chhue atal ke pair or phir diya dhokhprail 1999, atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar ko satta main 13 maheene biit chuke the
 Then the AIADMK of Jayalalithaa, an important ally of the alliance, withdrew support
 sarkaar alpamat main aa gai
 BSP supremo Mayawati, who was the chief minister in Uttar Pradesh with the support of the BJP, assured Atal's political managers that she would support the NDA
 us vakt ek-ek vot kii keemat thi
 On the day of voting on the trust vote, Mayawati went to meet Atal, touched his feet and spoke of the support of six party mps
 magar phir loksabhaa main mayawati palat gayi
 BSP mps voted against the NDA government
 sarkaar ek vot se gir gai
 Expressing happiness, Mayawati told the press, "I deliberately fooled the BJP
" 5
 It was only in 1999 that Sonia decided that Manmohan would be the PM of Congress
 In 1999, when the Atal government lost the vote of confidence by one vote, the ball came to the opposition's court
 sonia gandhi ne sarkaar banane kii koshishen tej kar deen
 Finally, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav vetoed this and mid-term elections were held in the country
 magar dilachasp yah he ki ab tak zyaadaatar log yah maanate the ki us vakt sonia ko pradhanmantri banane kii hadabadi thi
 Sonia is said to have submitted to President KR Narayanan both the list of letters of support and the claim to form the government
 magar raashtrapati narayanan kii maane to sonia gandhi khud pradhanmantri nahin bananaa chaahati thim
 He told Narayanan that if the coalition collects the required data for a majority, then he should administer oath to Manmohan Singh
 yani sonia 2004 main nahin, balki usase paanch saal pehle hi manmohan ko gaddi par baitaane kaa faisla kar chuki thim
 Perhaps in 1999, Manmohan Singh was contesting the Lok Sabha elections for the first and last time under this strategy
 magar, south dilli seat par vah bijepi ke vijay kumaar malhotra se 30 hajaar voton se chunaav haar gaye
 This book, written in English and from Westland Publication, is actually a by-product of a TV show by Veer Sanghvi during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 sanghavi ke mutabik sho kii research ke dauraan maine paaya ki nai peedi ko bhartiya raajnneeti ke kai ahm padaavon ke bare main zyada jaankaree nahin he
 Keeping this in mind, this book was written
 isamen 1971 se 2009 tak ke chunaavon kaa byora or vishleshan he
 In this, instead of traditional statistics, Sanghvi has talked about the important characters, events and trends of those elections
 jo log bhartiya raajnneeti ko kareeb se dekhte hai
 There is nothing new in the book for him
 agar aapane veepi singh, natwar singh, sanjay baru, arady pradhan, pisi eleggender or aise hi kai lutiuns dilli ke kirdaaron kii aatmakathaayen or kitaaben padhi hai, to aapako kai kisse jane pahachaane lagenge
 But as Sanghvi himself said, my intention is to give this generation a simple language in the form of Indian elections and a look at Indian politics in the same order, rather than starting a new debate in political science and making big revelations
 kitaab kii bhashaa saral he
 The method is interesting and shaped such that it can be read only in one or two readings

 Different suspicions are being made on this suspense of Sonam's movie
 aisa bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki yah Unexpected Love darasal, ek samalangik kahani he
 Many signs of this are also seen in the movie
 vahiin film main sonam or rajkumaar raav kii acchhee bonding dikhaai gai he
 Sonam first tells the prince her secret
 aamtaur par aapane mantriyon ko suut-boot main kaam nipataate dekha hoga yaa phir kurte pajame main
 However, Chhattisgarh Labor Minister Bhaiya Lal Rajawade is seen handling the work these days wearing a towel and a baniyaan
 mantri ji yah shauk se pahan rahe hai yaa mausam ko dekhte hue yah to vahi jaane
 But, this style of minister is not liked by women officers at all
 kai baar to unhen nazren pherani padati hai to kai maukon par shame se cheharaa dhankna padataa he
 Due to the heat, the minister changed the costumes, or the matter a few days and tied a red towel in the waist and a photo of the minister wearing a white vest has gone viral
 mantri ji lok suraaj abhiyaan ke tahat aae shikayati patron kaa avlokan apane bangale main kar rahe the
 The time of his meeting with top officers was favorable
 afasar bangale main pahunche lekin kachha-baniyaan dhari mantri ko dekh kar unke hosh phakhta ho gaye
 At first he felt that he came early, perhaps the minister has just returned from routine
 shaayad ab ve nahayenge or phir meeting hogi
 However, nothing like this happened
 mantri ji kaa ye andaaj dekh kar sharma jaati he mahila afsaffasaron ko dekh kar mantri ji kursi par jam gaye phir shikayaton or unke dauron ko lekar mantranaa shuru hui
 During this time, many women officers were shocked to see the minister's walk
 haalanki iskaa koi asar mantri ji par nahin hua wo beficri se kaamkaaj nipataate rahe
 Yes, it definitely happened that during this time, a person took the picture of the minister from mobile
 dekhte hi dekhte vahatasvir soshal media par viralho gai

 dhoni world cap ke baad se team main nahin hai or vah lagaataar chayankartaaon se aaraam maang rahe hai
 On the news of Dhoni's retirement, Gambhir said, 'I have always said that the decision to retire is everybody's personal decision
 mujhe lagata he ki chayankartaaon ko dhoni se baat kerani chahie or poochna chahie ki unki ranneeti kya he kyonki agar aap bharat ke liye khelte hai to aap siries kaa chunaav apane hisaab se nahin kar sakate
 Dhoni, who has not been on the field since the World Cup, remained under the target of critics during the 2019 World Cup due to his slow batting
 vah newjiland ke khilaaf semifinal main ran out ho gaye the, jiske baad hi bharat kii ummiido par pani phir gaya tha
 Dhoni took a break from international cricket after Team India was eliminated from the World Cup
 dhoni westeindies daure ke liye bharat ke simit overon ke squad se baahar rahe
 During this time he spent 15 days in Kashmir with the Territorial Army Unit
 vah dakshin africa ke khilaaf haal hi main sampann teen maichon kii gharelu tii-20 international siries main bhi nahin khele
 Also read- Gavaskar, furious about Pant, said - Batting management at this number
 Meanwhile, the Indian team management indicated that the former captain cannot be considered as 'out'
 dharmashala main dakshin africa ke khilaaf tii-20 match se pehle viraat kohli ne kaha tha, 'unke (dhoni) bare main ek badi baat yah he ki vah bhartiya cricket ke liye sochate hai
 And whatever we (team management) think, they also think the same
 ' kohli ne kaha tha ki yuva khilaadiyon ko taiyaar karne or unhen avasar dene ke bare main unki jis tarah kii maansikta thi, vah aaj bhi he
 On the other hand, Dhoni is paying full attention to fitness to return to the field
 khud ko feet rakhane ke liye pichley dinon unhen apane grih nagar ranchi main pasinaa bahaate dekha gaya
 He was seen practicing vigorously with young tennis nationals at the JSCA (jharkhand State Cricket Association) Stadium in Ranchi
 gambhir ne yah bhi kaha ki yuva wicketiper ballebaaj rishabh pant par dabaav bananaa sahi nahin he
 Team management should talk to them and support them
 ye bhi padhein- kohli kii yah takat ab bani kamajori, dobaaraa kii ye harakat to honge bingambhir ne pant kaa kiya bachaavgambhir ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki kisi bhi yuva khilaadi ke upar is tarah kaa focus karenge to pareshaani hogi
 He has only been in one and a half years in international cricket
 itane main hi wo test main do shatak jamaa chuke hai
 If you say that you have problems with their shot selection then this is their game
 aap unako team main lijie yaa nahin lijie
 If you are choosing them, then you support them because so much criticism of a young player is not right
 'gambhir ne kaha, 'sirf viraat kohli ko hi nahin coach ravi shastri ko bhi pant se baat kerani chahie
 The job of team management is that your player who is not in form or is doing wrong shot selection, talk to him and bring him to form and improve his game
 pant ko swatantraaa dene kii jarurat he

 Police said that his medical report confirmed that his finger was amputated after which he broke his finger
 nakhun bhale hi ded cell se bane hon, lekin phir bhi ye hamaare sharir kaa mahatvapurn hissaa hai
 According to Samudra Shastra, a lot can be known about the nature of any person by looking at their nails
 nakhun ke anusaar jaaniye kaisaa hota he kiskaa swabhaav-uttam nakhunauttam nakhun jo aarthik unnati or amiri ko darshaate hai unke vishay main kaha gaya he ki, jinke nakhun rekha or dhabba rahit chikne or laalimaa yukt hote hai vah dhanwaan hota hai
 The size of the nail is considered to be half of the first tip of the finger
 gulabi nakhungarg samhita ke anusaar jiske nakhun laal, chamkile, chikne or uthe hue hote hai vah saubhagyashaalee hota he
 If the nails come out of the finger and are pink, then it is also considered a symbol of good luck
 purushon ke nakhun maance main adhik dhanse nahin hon or gol hon to yah dhan-dhaany kaa suchak hota he
 Such a person keeps on progressing day by day
 nakhun kaa aakaar or iskaa rup rang aapaki aarthik sthiti or swabhav ko bhi darshata he
 As stated in the Garuda Purana, the fate of children whose nails are yellow is not the happiness of children
 nakhunon par dhabbe hon or nakhun dikhne main achche nahin hon to aisa vyakti jivan main bahut unnati nahin kar paata he
 Their economic condition is normal
 nakhun tede-medhaa or rekha yukt hona aarthik drushti se pratikul sthiti ko darshata he
 If you look at the nails of the crescent fingers on the nail, then the crescent moon appears between the nails
 kisi ke adhik to kisi ke kam yaa kisi ke nahin bhi hote hai
 These signs are never permanent and continue to decrease with time
 nakhunon ke mul bhaag main safed ardhchandra dikhaai de, to yah chinh shubh hokar jataka kii unnati kii ore ishaara karte hai
 In the near future, such people get progress
 hast rekha vigyaan ke anusaar anamika ungali ke nakhun ke bich tak ardhachandra kii akruti banane par maan-sammaan evam puraskaar miltaa he
 It is also considered a sign of the success that students get in competitive examinations
 sabase choti ungali jise budh kii ungali kaha jaataa he
 The appearance of crescent moon on this finger nail is a sign of progress and profit in business
 baudhon kii muslimon se yun he puraani dushmanitarjani anguli ke nakh ke mul main ardhchandra ho to vah jis kshetra main bhi ho unnati paata he
 If you are in job, you get promotion soon
 madhyamaa anguli nakh ke mul main ardhchandra dikhe to jataka ko kahin na kahin se akasmaat dhan milegaa
 He will also benefit in machine work
 choti anguli ke nakh mul main ardhchandra dikhaai de, to vah jataka vyapaar ke kshetra main unnati paane vaala hota he
 He definitely gets respect in future
 ardhchandra zyada se zyada madhya nakhun main ek sa bhi hona faldaayi hota he
 People whose nails are short, no matter how high and civilized they are born, are not of good nature according to oceanography
 aise vyakti asabhy va swaarthee hote hai
 They can go to any extent to serve their interests
 tede or asaamaanya nakhun vaale logon se bhi batch kar rahanaa chahie
 Criminal habits are hidden somewhere in people with speckled nails
 r akshar se shuru hota he jinka naam, unamem hoti he ye khubiyaanchote or pile nakhun vyakti ke makkaar swabhaav ko pradarshit karte hai, jabaki golakaar nakhun vyakti ke shashakt vichaaron va turant nirnay lene kii kshamta ko bataate hai
 People with thin and long nails are not able to take quick decisions and due to this tendency they have to suffer many times
 aise log nashe ke aadi hote hai
 If there are small nails and kinky fingers, then such people make gestures to their life partner
 haalanki, ye charitra ke achche hote hai, lekin in par puri tarah se vishwaas nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Persons with hard nails tend to be insistent with their quarrelsome attitude
 ye jo thaan lete hai, wo kar ke hi dam lete hai
 Whether they are right or wrong
 unhen kisi baat kii parvaah nahin hoti
 These beneficial people are to keep turtles at home, whose nails are longer than the width, then such people are constantly moving forward
 ye apane jivan main bahut unnati karte hai
 They understand and fulfill their duties well
 pehali ungali ke nakhun par bhi safed daag hona acha mana jaataa he
 In this, it indicates that you are going to benefit in thought
 anguuthe ke nakhun par hone vaale safed daag pyaar main milane vaali safalataa kii ore ishaara karte hai, lekin kai baar ye safed daag badanaami kaa sanket bhi hota he
 If you get a moon-shaped shape in the root of the fingernail of your hand, then you will also have the benefit of sudden money gains

 pakistan bhi yah bhalee-bhaanti jaanata he ki agar usne kashmir maamle ko antarrashtriya nyaayalay main uthaane kii koshish kii to usko pioke se bhi haath dhonaa padegaa
 It is because of this that the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on 21 April 1948, in which the Security Council directed Pakistan to evacuate pok and recall the army
 iske alaava suraksha parishad ne pioke ko jammu-kashmir main milaane kaa bhi nirdesh diya tha
 Now on the issue of Kashmir, British MP Bob Blackman has openly supported India
 unhone 21 april 1948 ke rijolution kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki pakistan adhikrut kashmir (pioke) samet puraa jammu-kashmir bharat kaa abhinn hissaa he
 The Security Council, in its first resolution, also believed that the entire Jammu and Kashmir including pok is part of India
 saath hi suraksha parishad ne pakistani sena or nagarikon se pioke khaali karne ko kaha tha
 Therefore Pakistan should evacuate pok
 british saansad ne kaha ki jo log jammu-kashmir par sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke rijolution kaa paalan karne kii baat karte hai, wo log sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke pehle rijolution ko nazarandaaj kar rahe hai
 Jitendra Mohan Sharma, vice-president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, says that after the removal of Article 370, the entire Jammu and Kashmir including pok has become a union territory of India
 ab pakistan kaa pioke par kisi bhi tarah kaa koi kanoonee haq bachaa hi nahin he
 With the Modi government's decision to remove Article 370, India's favor has become many times stronger internationally
 iske alaava supreme court ke edwocket upendra mishra kaa kahana he ki agar pakistan kashmir masale ko sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad yaa antarrashtriya nyaayalay main le jane main safal bhi ho jaataa he to usko vahaan munh kii khaani padegi kyonki kanoonee taur par bharat kaa paksh bahut majboot he
 On the Kashmir issue, the UN Security Council and the International Court of Justice will first ask Pakistan to vacate the pok, because the UN Security Council in its first resolution has instructed Pakistan to vacate the pok
 isse bharat kaa kaam aasaan ho jayega
 Supreme Court Advocate Upendra Mishra says that the United Nations Security Council had directed Pakistan to vacate the pok on India's complaint
 haalanki abhi tak pakistan ne sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke rijolution ko lagu nahin kiya he
 But he will have to empty pok one day or the other
 pioke par pakistan kaa he avaidh kabjabharat pehle se hi kahata aa rahaa he ki pakistan adhikrut kashmir yani pioke uskaa abhinn hissaa he or pakistan ko ise khaali karnaa chahie
 Recently, Union Defense Minister Rajnath Singh has also said that Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok) is an integral part of India
 ab agar pakistan se baat hogi, to sirf pioke par hogi
 India has been saying from the beginning that Pakistan has illegally captured Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistan ko pioke khaali karnaa hi padegaa
 Pakistan has been stunned in the Security Council Pakistan has been stunned since Article 370 was removed from Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistan ne pehle jang kii dhamkee di or phir china ko milakar sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kii close door baithak bulaai
 However, Pakistan did not get support of any country other than China in this meeting
 iske baad pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan or videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne kashmir maamle ko antarrashtriya nyaayalay le jane kii baat kahi, lekin unako pakistan ke kanoon mantralay ne hi naseehat de di ki agar maamle ko antarrashtriya nyaayalay main le jane kii galati kii to khamiyaja bhugatna padegaa

 However, this rain is not at all beneficial for the farmers, because crops have already been destroyed due to drought
 is barish se water level kii kuch bharpai ke asaar jarur hai
 In the last 24 hours, there was so much rain that the movement between Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh has come to a standstill
 chhattisgarh ke kawardha jile se madhyapradesh ke mandla, dindori or jabalpur tak kaa sampark tut gaya he
 The reason is that the bridges are broken in many areas
 chhattisgarh ke kawardha se mandla kii ore hajaaron gaadiyaan jam main fansi hai
 The state is raining at a time when it is not needed

 This is the first such period of monsoon rains in Chhattisgarh when there is a waterfall in the entire state

 Due to very low rainfall in the state from the first fortnight of the month of June to September, 15 September, drought conditions have been created in 22 districts of the state
 kisaanon ne kai ilaakon main buaai hi nahin kii gai
 So there were many areas where farmers sowed with good monsoon from the first second monsoon showers but later the monsoon was destroyed, now the monsoon has become active again
 madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh ke sarahadi ilaakon main jam kii vajah se doodh or saag-subjiyon jaisi rosemara kii vastuon kaa tota hona shuru ho gaya he
 This is an important route of movement on the outskirts of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, but this route has been stalled for the last twenty-four hours

 The farmers of UP have faced the weather of the first season, now are facing the roughness of the market
 kheton se jo fasal mil saki, uski bhi unhen keemat nahin mil rahi he
 Wheat which went up to Rs 1600-1700 quintal last year is being sold for Rs 1300-1400 this year
 darasal baari barish or ole main jo tabaahi hui uski vajah se pehle to kaaphi fasal kharaab ho gayi
 The quality of wheat that came out of the crop left is not good

 Wheat has turned black due to fall

 According to him, if you love your skin and pants very much, then you should give up the thought of climbing the cracks

 Though he has done such feats in his country too, but the situation here and here was quite different
 vah bataati hai ki aise raaston par chadhane ke liye aapako sabase adhik apane haathon par bharosa karnaa chahie
 Nothing can be better if your hands are adept at catching, cracking, cracking

 The twisted eyes of the girls never give up
 kya aap jaanate hai ki koi insaan kisi ladki ko ghurne par jindagi kaa kitna vakt qurbaan kar detaa he? ek research main vipareet sex ko ghurne se sambandhit sabhi tarah ke tathyon kaa khulaasa kiya gaya he
 On average 43 minutes a day scientists stare at these questions to find out how much time a person spends in staring at a girl, tearing her eyes and looking
 ek british research ke har ek nattejey chaunkaane vaale hai
 According to the research conducted by the British organization Kodak Lanes Vision based on the opinion of 3000 people between the ages of 18 and 50, a man spends a full year of his life staring at girls
 din bhar main ek insaan ausatan ek 2 nahin balki alag-alag 10 ladakiyon ko ghur letaa he
 On an average, men spend not two to four minutes per day, but on average 43 minutes of girls or women taking turns staring or tearing eyes
 chaahakar bhi chhod nahin pate adamgar aap ab tak ye samajhate rahe hai ki ladakiyon to ghoorna purushon kii koi vikruti he yaa maansik rup se vikrut log hi ladakiyon ko chowk-chauraahey, bazaar, park yaa daftar main aankhe fadkar ghoorte hai, to aapako soch badalane kii jarurat hai
 British research proves that every human has the tendency to stare at the opposite sex
 insaan chaahakar bhi ghurne kii aadat chhod nahin paata
 Girls are not even back in the stare if you have been thinking that girls do not do the work that boys do, then it is wrong
 ladkiyaan isamen bhi ladakon ke kadam se kadam mila rahi hai
 Like boys, girls also like to stare at the opposite sex
 ladkiyaan bhi ladakon ko ghurne main, ankhon se aankhe milaane main, najaron se ojhal hone tak aankhon main aankh daalkar rakhane main peeche nahin hai
 While alone, girls undoubtedly play less games of staring at stunted boys or eyeballing them, but in the presence of our peers, girls play the game of eyeballs as much as boys
 ladkiyaan detii hai jivan ke 6 mahbritish sanstha kodak lens vijan ke research main ladakiyon kii vipareet sex ko ghurne kii aadat par bhi ankhe kholane vaale nattejey saamne aae hai
 Although girls or women have less tendency to stare as compared to boys or men, they also spend a lot of time of their life drinking juice from the eyes
 18 se 50 umr kii mahilaon kii raay ko aadhaar banaakar kiye gaye research ke mutabik ladkiyaan yaa mahilaayein bhi ausatan jindagi ke puure 6 maheene vipareet sex ko ghurne par kharch kar detii hai
 The average period of staring of girls per day is 20 minutes
 har din ausatan 6 ladke nigahon memresearch main ye bhi pataa chalaa he ladkiyaan yaa mahilaayein ausatan 6 ladakon yaa purushon ko ausatan har din ghur leti hai
 The question is what do girls see in boys
 ladke agar ladakiyon ko ghoorte hai to kyon ghoorte hai is par bhi research se chaukaaney vaali jaankariyaan mili hai
 Both games are very much liked by the eyes, but the center of attraction is different for both
 ladakiyon ke sharir main aakarshanpurushon ko ladakiyon kaa sharir hi aakarshith karata he
 The shape of the body is smooth and beautiful, the eyes of the boys remain on the girl for that long
 lekin ladakiyon ke liye aakarshan kaa centre ladakon kaa sharir nahin balki kuch or hai
 The girls draw the eyes of the boys and once they get the eyes, then the girls just drown in it
 ladkiyaan khud ladakon ko ghoorna to pasand karti hai
 Even on average, for the entire 6 months of life, she spends about 20 minutes every day staring at boys, but girls do not like boys to stare at them
 zyaadaatar maamalon main ladakon kii ghurti nigahon se ladkiyaan yaa to saham jaati hai yaa sharmindagi mahasoos karti hai
 Girls are nervous when they are stared, if the eyesight is about to penetrate the body, then the girls get frightened too badly
 lekin ladakon ke saath aisa nahin he
 Not only do boys have more habit of staring, but the choice of boys than girls is also vomiting
 ladkiyaan jab ladakon ko ghurti hai yaa unpar mud-mundakar nazren gadaati hai, to ladakon ko khub bhaataa he
 The truth is that when the girls stare at them, the boys feel proud of themselves and start wandering in friends
 saaf he thodi masti ke liye yaa man bahalane ke liye, kabhi doston main rob dikhaane ke liye yaa kabhi bas vipareet sex ko samajhane ke makasad se mud-mudakar dekhnaa aisi fitrat he, jo insaan ke liye chaahakar bhi chhodana mumkin nahin
 It is easy for the common people to see the opportunity or see it openly, but what do those people who are the president of a country or are big players or big stars? What do people on high positions like US President Hussein Obama or French President Nicolas Sarkozy do? The place where Obama's handiwork caught staring was no less modest
 isi saal italy main hue ji-8 mulkon ke sammelan ke dauraan unhen ladakiyon ko ghoorte paaya gaya, jahaan ji-8 kii sadsy mulk duniya bhar kii aarthik mandi, aatankwaad auki duniya se garibi mitaane jaise bade muddon par bahes karne ke liye ikattha hui thim
 Sarkozy is no less helpless than US President Barack Hussein Obama, but also French President Nicolas Sarkozy, with no reason to stare at girls
 obama kii najar to jam hi gai magar france ke raashtrapati sarkoji ne bhi ji8 sammelan main hissaa lene ai brazil kii mahila delygat ko ghurne kaa mauka ganvaana uchit nahin samajha
 Many well-known celebrities of the world have been caught stealing by staring at their eyes or seeing an opportunity
 tirchhi najaron se america chiyar girl par najar gadaane waalon main janemaane footdoollar david bekham bhi hai
 The pleasure of watching the opposite sex is as much pleasure in watching the opposite sex as it is after the hungry gets food or after the thirst gets water
 insaan kii sanrachana hi asi he ki vipareet sex par najar padate hi sharir main ek hormonal pratikriya hoti he auki aanandit hone kaa adbhut ehsaas hota he
 To some extent, it is considered natural for men to be attracted towards a woman or a woman towards a man, somewhere there are biologic factors behind it
 hormonal factors hai, khaas taur par yang edltahud ke andar aapke andar hormones kaaphi peak par hote hai
 The hormone that is called testosterone inside men produces an atrophy, a design, due to which sometimes you pay more attention towards the other sex
 khud hi pad jaati he najraisi prakaar se mahilaon ke adanr bhi sexual hormone peak par hote hai, jisase kahin na kahin ek dhyaan ek tavajjo duusare sex kii taraf jaati he
 This is the happiness that no human wants to be deprived of, and whenever there is an opportunity, the eyes of a human are automatically drawn towards him

 Shivpal Yadav, who has been on the edge of Samajwadi Party for the last one and a half years, has chosen his future political path
 unhone samaajawaadee secular morcha banane kaa elaan karte hue kaha ki sapa main jis kisi kaa bhi sammaan nahin ho rahaa he, un logon ko hamaare saath aa janaa chahie
 Leave to the SP leaders, his 'tridev', who was expelled from the party along with Shivpal, has not yet decided to go with this front
 bataa den ki deepak mishra, mo
 Shahid and Rajesh Yadav are called the trinity of Shivpal
 akhilesh or shivpal ke bich rishton main khatas 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle shuru hui
 After this Akhilesh removed his uncle Shivpal from the cabinet
 shivpal ke baad akhilesh kii gaaj unketridev sahit paanch karibiyonper giri
 Akhilesh, Deepak Mishra, Mo
 shahid, rakesh yadav, kallu yadav or rajesh yadav ko party se baahar kar diya tha
 These five leaders did not join any other party even after being expelled from the SP
 shivpal ke 'tridev' to bas isi intjaar main the ki sapa kunbe main sulah samjhaute kii rasta bane or unki dobaaraa se party main vaapasi ho sake
 Now that Shivpal has chosen his political path apart from SP, these three leaders are not able to decide yet
 shivpal ke kareebi netaa ne naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki samaajawaadee secular morcha kii raajnneetik disha abhi saaf nahin he
 While we wanted these families to remain together and be compromised in some way, but this does not seem to be happening
 shivpal or akhilesh ke alag hone se kisi ko bhi phayda nahin milegaa balki raajnneetik nuksaan hoga
 Let me tell you that after coming to the command of SP in the hands of Akhilesh Yadav, there are many leaders in the party who have been completely sidelined
 inamen shivpal or mulaayam singh yadav ke kareebi netaa shaamil hai
 The SP is dominated by leaders close to Akhilesh and Ram Gopal Yadav
 shivpal ke raajnneetik faisla lene ke baad mana ja rahaa he ki in sabhi netaaon kaa nayaa thikaana samaajawaadee secular morcha banegaa
 But the way socialist politics is seen in the hands of future Akhilesh Yadav
 aise main shivpal kheme main jane se log kataraa rahe hai
 Whereas Shivpal had a strong hold in the sp's organization at one stage
 uttar pradesh main koi aisa jila nahin he jahaan kam se kam 2 se 4 hajaar kaaryakarta shivpal ke na hon
 In fact, because of Shivpal's not joining the front, there is also a fear that someday Mulayam Singh Yadav will call him and explain again, then he will agree
 shivpal ke ek kareebi ne is baat kaa sanshay jaahir karte hue bataaya ki agar abhi morcha se jud gaye or kuch dinon ke baad unhone ise banane kii manshaa ko taal diya to jo bachi-kuchi raajnneeti he wo khatm ho jaaegi
 Shivpal is yet to say goodbye to the SP
 unhone mahaj ek morcha banaaya he
 However, he formed this front only after the assembly elections, which he gave the responsibility to Farhat Mian
 shivpal ne pradesh adhyaksh rahete hue farhat miyaan ko party ke alpsankhyak kii kaman saunpi thi

 RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav's book 'gopalganj to Raisina: My Political Journey' is coming soon
 lalu ne is kitaab main daawa kiya he ki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar mahagathbandhan se alag hone ke 6 maheene baad dobaaraa se mahagathbandhan main shaamil hona chaahate the
 But he did not agree to it
 lalu prasad ke saath-saath unke bete or bihar ke purv dipti siem tejasvi yadav ne bhi daawa kiya he ki nitish kumaar mahagathbandhan main waapas aana chaahate the
 Lalu Yadav has claimed in his autobiography that Nitish Kumar sent his colleague Prashant Kishore to talk to him 5 times to join the Grand Alliance again
 lekin lalu ne nitish ko waapas mahagathbandhan main lene se saaf inkaar kar diya
 If he accepted this book of Lalu, he stopped the entry of Nitish Kumar into the grand alliance because Nitish had broken his trust and he could not trust him again
 lalu ne is kitaab main kaha he ki unhen nitish kumaar se koi naaraazgi nahin thi, magar unhen is baat ko lekar chintaa thi ki agar unhone prashanth kishor kii baat maanakar nitish ko dobaaraa mahagathbandhan main shaamil kar liya to bihar kii janata isko kis tareeke se legi
 Lalu has also claimed in the book that Prashant Kishor also met his son and former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav to re-join Nitish Kumar in the grand alliance
 prashanth kishor ne unhen bharosa dilaayaa tha ki agar aisa hota he to loksabhaa chunaav main mahagathbandhan kii uttar pradesh or bihar main badi jeet hogi or bijepi ko in donon rajyon se samaapt kar diya jayega
 In response to Lalu's sensational claims, Prashant Kishore, who is now the vice-president of JDU, has fully dubbed all the claims as bogus
 prashanth kishor ne twit karte hue likhaa ki lalu prasad ne apane aap ko charchaa main banaae rakhane ke liye ek naakaamayaab koshish kii he
 Prashant Kishore said that Lalu's good days are now behind
 haalanki prashanth kishor ne apane twit main yah baat sweekaar kiya he ki jediu main shaamil hone se pehle unhone lalu prasad se kai baar mulaakaat kii thi
 But he revealed that what happened between the two during this time would make Lalu Prasad Yadav very embarrassed

 singh ne ek chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi dwaara paanch saal main pradesh kii tasviir badal dene kaa vaada kiye jane kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha ki jo party berogari, mahangaai or bhrashtachar ke liye jimmedaar he, usee ke netaa pradesh kii takadir or tasviir badal dene kaa vaada karte gum rahe hai
 The former BJP president said that the Congress government ministers are busy planting notes and the farmers of the country are forced to commit suicide
 atal bihari bajpeyi ke netritv main kendra main chah saal tak satta main rahi bhaajapanit rajg sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kaa ullekh karte hue singh ne kaha ki rajg sarkaar main mahangaai par nirantar ankush laga rahaa he, magar kanges nit samprag sarkaar banane ke baad mahangaai betahasha badhati ja rahi he or bhrashtachar ke maamle ujagar ho rahe hai
 Singh said that after the formation of the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, farmers reiterated their promise of waiving farm loans up to Rs 1 lakh and arranging agricultural loans at one percent interest
 isse purv ambedkar nagar ke katehari vidhansabha kshetra main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue singh ne kaha ki bhaajapa satta main aane par pradesh kii mukhyamantri mayawati or purv mukhyamantri mulaayam singh yadav kii aay se adhik sampatti tathaa bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch ke liye ayog kaa gathan karegi

 In such a situation, Lok Sabha seats should also be declared here
 lekin adaalat ne is yachika ko khaarij kar diya
 Significantly, Gilgit is currently under Pakistan Occupied Kashmir

 Premium charges apply!! The doors of Badrinath Dham, which is called the eighth Vaikuntha of the world, were opened on May 10, 2019 at 4
15 am this year
 jiske baad baba badrivishaal ke darshan karne ke liye shraddhaluon kii lambii kataren lagi hui hai
 Yesterday i
e
 on May 19, PM Modi was also here to see Lord Vishnu
 yah hinduon ke chaar dhaamon main se ek dham he
 Which is located in the state of Uttarakhand on the banks of the Alaknanda River
 yahaan bhagwaan vishnu 6 maah nidra main rahete hai or 6 maah jaagate hai
 In such a way, know that 7 things related to Badrinath Dham, which hardly anyone will know about
 -badrinaath dham se judi ek manyata he ki 'jo aae badari, wo na aae odari'
 This means that once a person has seen Badrinath, he does not have to enter the mother's womb again
 -badrinaath ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki yahaan pehle bhagwaan bholenath kaa nivas hua karata tha lekin baad main bhagwaan vishnu ne is sthaan ko bhagwaan shiv se maang liya tha
 Badrinath Dham is situated between two mountains
 inhen nar narayan parvat kaha jaataa he
 It is said that Nar and Narayan, the parts of Lord Vishnu, did penance
 nar apane agle janm main arjuna to narayan shri krishna ke rup main paidaa hue the
 - It is recognized that the doors of Kedarnath and Badrinath are opened at that time, the sight of the lamp burning in the temple has special significance
 aisa mana jaataa he ki 6 maheene tak band daravaaje ke andar devtaa is deepak ko jalaae rakhte hai
 The priests of Badrinath are descendants of Shankaracharya
 kaha jaataa he ki jab tar yah log rawal pad par rahete hai inhen brahmacharya kaa paalan karnaa padataa he
 It is considered taboo for women to touch these people
 -kedarnath ke kapaat khulne kii tithi kedarnath ke rawal ke nirdesan main ukhimath main panditon dwaara tay kii jaati he
 In addition to the usual facilities, traditions are taken care of
 yahi kaaran he ki kai baar aise bhi muhoort bhi aae hai jisase badrinath ke kapaat kedarnath se pehle khole gaye hai
 Whereas usually the doors of Kedarnath are opened first
 haalanki ab tak adhyaksh pad ke liye jagmohan daalamia ke alaava kisi or pad ke liye naam par sahmati nahin bani he, lekin mana ja rahaa he ki board main en shrinivasana kaa dabadabaa bana rahegaa
 Sanjay Patel of his camp and Anirudh Chaudhary will continue as treasurer
 pehle mana ja rahaa tha ki bijepi ke saansad sadsy anuraag thakur ko sanyukt sachiv se sachiv banaaya ja saktaa he, lekin shrinivasana camp unhen north zone se vaais president bana saktaa he
 In such a situation, the names of Brajesh Patel and Amitabh Chaudhary may come up for the post of Joint Secretary
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne 12 disambar 2018 ko us janhit yachika ko khaarij kar diya tha jisamen centre sarkaar ko maamle ke doshi mukesh, pawan, vinay or akshay ko mili faansee kii sajaa par amal karne ke nirdesh dene kii maang kii gai thi

 kai filmein aisi hoti hai, jinhen banane ke liye bana liya jaataa he
 Desi Katte is also a similar film
 film dekhne par sirf aisa lagata he ki kai hindi filmon kaa masala jodakar film bana lee gai he
 But still the story is not made
 kahani main na to dam he or na hi koi nayaapan hi
 Even in the case of Starcast, the film is not a big attachment
 sunil shetty lambey samay baad bade parade par najar aa rahe hai
 The story of the film is from Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, where two childhood friends Jai Bhanushali and Akhil have to go far ahead in the world of crime in Kanpur
 ve don ashutosh rana ke sampark main aate hai
 Then there is the entry of Sunil Shetty, who works hard to make him a shooting champion
 yahaan achchhai or buraai kaa aagaaj hota he
 Just then the paths of the two friends part ways
 aisa bollywood kii kai filmon main dekha ja chukaa he
 And the glimpse of such friendship or say bromance was also seen in Gunda some time back
 acting ke department main bhi film ke paas koi khaas jamaa puunji he nahin
 This is Jai Bhanushali's second film
 het story-2 main ve aae the, lekin usamen sara kaam surveen chawla kaa tha
 Jai Bhanushali had a lot of work in it, yet he could not do some miracles
 kamjor kahani or is tarah ke role main ve miss feet najar aate hai
 Akhil Kapoor still has a long way to go
 sunil shetty kii acting waisi hi he, jaisi hameshaa hoti he
 Ashutosh Rana is the only actor who appeals to some, and whose acting looks good

 Pakistan has said that it is necessary to hear Jadhav's confession in this matter
 pakistan ne antarrashtriya adaalat ko raajnneeti kaa rangamanch banane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Read what else Pakistan said in ICJ
 
 
 - jadhav kaa kaboolnamaa sunanaa jaruri India should not make it the theater of politics - antarrashtriya adaalat kaa raajnneetik istemaal kar rahaa he bharat - We are committed to a peaceful resolution of the matter, no matter how much we try to provoke - jadhav ke passport kii baat kare bharat - Viewers can decide whether Jadhav is volunteering or not - pakistan ne sajaa ke baad 150 din kaa samay diya - There is no possibility of seeking a petition by the High Court in this case - logon ko ateet main pakistan kii adaalaton se raahat milti rahi he - Pakistan wants to live peacefully with neighbors - raajnneetik dalon ke hisaab baraabar karne ke liye adaalat kaa samay or sansaadhan barbaad karne kii hamaari koi ichha nahin he - Indian media has shown the international court letter as a 'ban' which is not
 yah ek tarah se tathyon se bhatkaana he - Jadhav arrested in Balochistan - jadhav ke passport main muslim naam - This is not a matter of emergency - counciller pahunch ke liye yogya nahin he kulbhushan jadhav Jadhav's confession required to be heard - ise raajnneeti kaa rangamanch na banaae bharat - India is using the international court politically - ham maamle ke shantipurna hal ke liye patibaddh hai, chaahe hame jitna bhi uksaane kii koshish kii jaae - Talk about Jadhav's passport India - darshak tay kar sakate hai ki jadhav swechha se kabool kar rahaa he yaa nahin - Pakistan gave 150 days time after conviction - is maamle main hoicourt dwaara yachika kii maang karne kii koi sambhaavna nahin he - People have been getting relief from the courts of Pakistan in the past - pakistan padosiyon ke saath shantipurna tareeke se rahanaa chahta he - We have no desire to waste the time and resources of the court to equalize the political parties - bhartiya media ne antarrashtriya adaalat ke patr ko 'roak' ke rup main dikhaaya he jo ki nahin he
 This is a way to deviate from the facts - baluchistan main jadhav ko giraftaar kiya gaya - Muslim name in Jadhav's passport - ye argency kaa maamla nahin - Kulbhushan Jadhav is not eligible for councilor access aishwarya raay bachchan ke pita krishnaraj raay kaa shanivaar dopaher nidhan ho gaya

 Sunanda said that she did not expect to express regret to the Chief Minister of Gujarat who has not regretted the 2002 post-godhra riots for the last ten years

 In view of Railway Minister Mukul Rai's disappearance from the ministry for a long time, departmental officials are worrying about the safety of railways
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki unki anupasthiti ke kaaran mahatvapurn faislon main deree ho rahi he
 The railway ministry is generally considered safe for the Trinamool Congress
 pehle is pad par khud trinmul congress kii pramukh mamata banerjee thim
 He was followed by Dinesh Trivedi and now Mukul Rai is also from the Trinamool Congress party
 railway board ke ek purv adhyaksh ne kaha, 'mantri kii anupasthiti se galat sandesh jaataa he
 This disrupts the entire network
 'board ke kai purv adhikariyon ne isi tarah ke vichaar rakhe
 He said that the railway is the lifeline of the country and cannot be run with remote control, as it has to keep pace with important ministries like Home Ministry and Prime Minister's Housing
 raay ne 20 march ko mantralay sambhaala or tab se vah apni purvavarti banerjee kii tarah hi party ke kaam se lambe lambe samay tak mantralay se gaayab rahete hai
 This is because he is second in the party
 rail mantralay ke ek adhikari ke mutabik banerjee kii tarah hi mahatvapurn dastavej raay kii manjuuri ke liye kolkata bheja jaataa he
 Rai was unable to attend many cabinet meetings due to absence
 vah sookhe par 31 july ko mantriyon ke adhikaar praapt samooh kii baithak main bhi shaamil nahin ho paae
 Former Cabinet Secretary Naresh Chandra said, "banerjee is responsible for this situation
 yadi unhone raay ko rail mantri ke rup main namit kiya he, to yah unki galati he
 He said that theoretically there is nothing wrong in sending the document to Kolkata, but being absent from the ministry can be considered a lack of sense of responsibility

 koyala ghotaale main bahut se chehre kaale to ho gaye, lekin ab sibiai jis tarah kaa utavlaapan dikhaa rahi he, vah samaj se pare he
 Admittedly, this investigating agency has been instructed by the Supreme Court to take the biggest step independently, but that does not mean that it should do something in zeal that would push investment in the country and hurt the business sentiment 
 abhi koyala ghotaale main sibiai kii jaanch hi chal rahi he or bahut si baton kaa pataa chalanaa he, lekin iske pehle hi usne ek or exiaar kar di
 After this, the then Coal Secretary PC Parikh said that if i am accused of Colgate, the name of the Prime Minister should also be included in it
 aapke priy website aaj tak dot com ne is par janata se vot maanga ki pradhanmantri kaa naam bhi isamen shumaar hona chahie yaa tatkaaleen koyala sachiv galat bol rahe hai
 The results were shocking
 95
 3 percent said that the name of the Prime Minister should also be included in it, while only 4
 7 pratishat ne kaha ki purv koyala sachiv galat bol rahe hai
 This result is saying many things on its own
 sabase pehle to isse ek baat saaf ho gai ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii bedaag chhavi ab taar-taar ho chuki he or duusare ve desh kii janata kaa vishwaas khote ja rahe hai
 Public voting also matters because very few people know the former coal secretary and he is not a political leader either
 unke bayaan kaa itnaa jabardast samarthan yah darshata he ki janata main ab sarkaar ke bayanon kaa mahatv khatm ho gaya he
 This is true and it is also necessary that there should be transparency in government tendering and everything is fully recorded, because only this will prevent corruption in the country
 hamaare pathakon ne jis tarah se ek swar main koyala ghotaale maamle main us samay ke sachiv pisi parakh kii is baat se sahmati jataai he ki is maamle main pradhanmantri ko bhi aaropee banaaya janaa chahie, usase lagata he ki sibiai kaa yah kadam galat he
 The support of such a large number of readers to Parikh is an indication that the CBI has defaulted in this case

 (from input language) congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne congress kaarysmiti kii baithak main kai aisi jaankariyaan deen jisase kii baithak main maujuud kai netaaon ko aashcharya hua
 Rahul Gandhi hinted at some leaders and said that some leaders pressured their sons to get tickets
 rahul ne bataaya ki ek netaa ne yahaan tak kah diya ki agar unke bete ko tikat nahin mila to vah party chhodane par vichaar kar sakate hai
 Rahul Gandhi said in the working committee meeting that apart from Gandhi family, if anyone can preside over the party, they have no difficulty in it
 lekin kai varisht netaa jaise dow
 Manmohan Singh, Ahmed Patel, AK Antony and Ghulam Nabi Azad prevented him from doing so
 lekin rahul gandhi apane istife ko lekar ke ade hue hai or unka kahana he ki party par unhone soch vichaarkar apni raay rakhi he or party bhi khule man se is par vichaar kar faisla le
 During the Congress Working Committee meeting, some things also went against Rahul's team
 kuch sadasyon ne is ore ishaara kiya ki rahul kii team main oxford or harvard ke padhe log hai bhale hi vah behad qaabil hon lekin wo or raajnneetik log nahin he
 
 logon kaa ishaara jaahir he sam pitroda kii taraf tha
 People believe that the Congress has suffered a lot due to the statement 'hua to Hua' given on the 1984 Sikh riots
 rahul gandhi ko yah bhi salaah di gai ki vah apni team main raajnneeti kii samaj rakhane vaale logon ko bhi shaamil karen jisase team balance lage or raajnneetik faisale lene main unhen aasaani ho
 When Rahul Gandhi was talking about his resignation, everyone's eyes turned to Sonia Gandhi who was present in that meeting but Sonia Gandhi did not give any answer, did not show any interest
 lekin uttar pradesh ke prabharee mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne kaha ki yadi rahul gandhi istifa dete hai to yah ekatarah se BJP ke jaal main funsane jaisaa hoga kyonki bijepi yahi chaahati he
 But the biggest question is whether Rahul Gandhi can make a big change in the Congress
 haar kii zimmedaari un rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ko di ja sakati he jahaan congress kaa khaataa nahin khulaa yaa phir unhen ek yaa do siten ai hai
 In these states, the Congress did so well in December and formed its government
 4 maheenon main yahaan aisa kya badal gaya jisase loksabhaa ke chunaav main party kaa yaa to khaataa nahin khulaa yaa phir 1 yaa do siten ai hai
 The question is whether the Chief Minister is ready to take responsibility for this or whether he has any answer
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri to kaary samiti kii baithak main aae tak nahin unhone yah bahaanaa kar diya ki vahaan par vidhayak dal kii baithak unhone bulaayi he isliye unka bhopal main rahanaa aavashyak he kyonki BJP unke sarkaar ko or sthir karne main lagi hui he
 In the working committee meeting, several senior leaders tried to convince Rahul Gandhi that this was not the first defeat of the party, even before the party had suffered a similar defeat in the era of Indira Gandhi to other Congress presidents
 
 magar iskaa muqaabala nai ranneeti ke saath karne kii zarurat he kyonki ab vaqt kaafii badal gaya he or party ko usee vaqt ke saath badalane kii zarurat he
 Suggestions also came about how to make cadre in the party, what should be the role of Seva Dal, how to instill confidence among the youth in the policies of Congress
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki congress kii nyaay yojana jinke liye thi unheen tak party apni baat pahunchane main vifal rahi he
 Now, amidst all these things, the responsibility of Rahul Gandhi increases considerably for what new changes he makes
 party main yuvaaon or bujurgon ke bich samanvay hoga or anubhav ke saath yuva ko jod kar kis tarah se aam logon ko sthaan diya jayega
 Will the experiences of Kerala leaders and Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh also be taken advantage of
 kya rahul gandhi unase milakar kuch tips lene kii koshish karenge ki akhir jo mudda bijepi ke liye puure desh bhar main chalaa vah punjab main kyon nahin chal paaya
 Will Rahul go to Stalin to see how the DMK ended the AIADMK and BJP alliance in Tamil Nadu
 magar sabaki nigahen is par hongi ki rahul aane vaale dinon main kis tarah kaa pherbadal party main karte hai or priyanka gandhi kii bhoomika badhati he yaa uttar pradesh tak hi simit rahati he
 Not only this, what will be the policies of the Congress, as well as the party will have to wait for the right opportunity and issue like Indira Gandhi did in the scandal
 saath hi rahul ko apane sahyogi dalon ko bhi bharosa or dilasa dena hoga khaskar argedy ke tejasvi yadav ko or kinartak main kumaraswami se bhi baat kerani hogi ki unki sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he
 Rahul will have to form a team that can work with renewed vigor

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on his visit to Russia that the Kudankulam nuclear power project is moving on the right path
 unhone shuukravaar ko moscow main roosi netaaon ko is bare main aashwast kiya
 The Prime Minister said that the first reactor of the Kudankulam plant would start functioning within a few weeks
 unhone kaha ki duusare riector kaa kaam shuru karne ke liye 6 maah kii samay-seemaa tay kii gai he
 The Prime Minister's statement comes at a time when the local residents of Tamil Nadu are strongly opposing this project for security reasons

 yah bayaan sweekaarya nahin he

 mahila ke pati ne aadhe ghante intjaar karne ke baad patni ko talash kiya
 But she could not be found

 After that they saw that a woman from the washroom went out wearing a burqa

 Despite putting a lot of emphasis on the mind, he could not remember what he had recently bought with a credit card
 thak-harkar customer care ko phone milaayaa
 He said that this bill is nothing but an 'annual maintenance charge'
 lekin credit card dete vakt to bank kii taraf se kaha gaya tha ki koi anual charge aadi nahin he
 
 phir ye kyon? isapar customer care riprogentative ne kaha kisalbhar ke andar ek nishchit dhanrashi kii kharidari karne par hi anual charge nahin lagata he
 i tried to remember again
 yaad aayaa ki card dete vakt to bank kii taraf se iskaa bhi zikranhin kiya gaya tha
 No sir, that is our policy, the representative said
 khayr, maine gusse main phone rakh diya
 Then i remembered why only the annual charge

 Just a few days ago, news came that 21 public sector banks and three major private sector banks recovered more than Rs 5,000 crore from customers during FY 2017-18 for not keeping the minimum amount in the account
 aap jaanakar chaunk jaaenge ki isamen se state bank of india(esbiai) ne akele 2,433

 PNB, the 'victim' of Nirav Modi and his maternal uncle Mehul Choksi, collected Rs 207 crore from people during the last four financial years only in the name of account closure

 In response to a question last month, the government said that during the last four years a total of 19102 complaints related to fraud were received and 1 lakh 14 thousand 221 crore rupees were paid
 yah koi choti-moti dhanrashi nahin he
 Despite this, no concrete steps were taken to stop bank fraud
 punjab neshnal bank kaa hi udhaaharan le len
 PNB was on the verge of sinking due to Nirav Modi & Co
, but despite this the bank did not learn any lesson
 iskaa nateeja yah rahaa ki vartmaan vittiya varsh yani 2018-19 kii pehali chamahi main phir pienbi ke 1500 karod rupye se zyada dhokhadhadi kii bhent chadh gaye
 That is, the entire focus of the banks is on 'cheating' customers in different ways than preventing fraud

 Because on these issues the constitution bench of the Supreme Court is going to hear
 lau kamishan ne apil main saaf kiya he ki teen talaak ke mudde par vichaar nahin kiya jayega
 Because that issue is currently pending in Parliament after the decision of the court

 At present, whoever asks about the Char Dham Yatra, they count the names of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri
 jabaki ye vaastavik chaar dham na hokar choti chaar dham hai
 In Indian scriptures, Badrinath, Dwarka, Jagannath Puri and Rameswaram are discussed as Char Dham
 ise aaj kal badi chaar dham bhi kaha jaataa he
 Actually, Char Dham means these four shrines
 chaar dham yatra kyon karte hai, iske bare main koi nishchit niyam or kaaran dharmagranthon main nahin he or na hi chaar dham yatra kii utpatti ke sambandh main koi nishchit manyata or sakshya uplabdh hai
 But these texts mention that this journey not only frees us from sin but also takes it beyond the cycle of birth and death, that is, it paves the way to salvation
 hindu dharmagranthon main varnan miltaa he ki jo puneatma yahaan kaa darshan karne main safal hote hai, unke na keval is janam ke paap dhul jate hai, varan ve jivan-maran ke bandhan se bhi mukt ho jate hai
 But this applies to almost all pilgrimages equally
 hindu dharmagranthon main yah bhi kaha gaya he ye vahi pavitra sthaan hai, jahaan prithvi or swarg ekaakaar hote hai
 As far as Chhoti Char Dham Yatra is concerned, pilgrims first visit Yamunotri and Gangotri to visit these places
 phir in sthanon se pavitra jal lekar kedarnath shivlinga par jalabhishek karte hai or phir bhagwaan vishnu ke ek rup badrinathi ke darshan karte hai

 The incident is about the 2013 assembly elections
 chhattisgarh kii rajdhani raipur kii ek vidhansabha seat se haai profile ummidavaar ne virdohi dal ke varisht netaa ke saath saudebaaji kii
 Five leaders of the opposing party were given names, out of which two were asked not to give tickets in any case and the rest three
 yah chunaav prabandhan kaa aisa formula he, jisaki ummid kam se kam rashtriya party main nahin kii ja sakati
 But such political games are very common in Chhattisgarh
 kuch isi tarah kaa formula 2014 main antagarh vidhansabha upachunaav main apanaaya gaya
 Congress candidate Manturam Pawar (now BJP member) withdrew his name at a time when the party could not declare any other candidate
 dabi jubaan hui rajnatik deal kaa khulaasa disambar 2015 ke aakhir main ek audio tepe ke saarvajanik hone ke baad hua
 It allegedly records the conversation of Chief Minister Raman Singh's son-in-law Punit Gupta, former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi, his son Amit Jogi, Manturam Pawar and middleman Feroz Siddiqui
 is tepe main saaf taur par naam waapas lene ke liye lenden or vaade ke mutabik puri rakam nahin milane ko lekar naaraazgi jataai ja rahi he
 The Congress immediately showed Amit Jogi a way out of the party and then sent the recommendation of action against Ajit Jogi to the high command
 iske baavjood congress kii kalah kam hoti nahin dikh rahi
 The main reason for this is Ajit Jogi's support base and his steadfast strategic understanding
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki teen baar se satta se maharoom congress alaakaman kya jogi parivaar ko party se baahar karne kaa saahas dikhaa saktaa he?congress kii chatapataahatadrasal, jab-jab chhattisgarh main congress ne jogi ke manamafik netritv nahin diya, andruni ladaai sataha par dikhti rahi
 State Congress President Bhupesh Baghel tried relentlessly to get Jogi fired
 lekin jogi kii chaal ko ve bhaanp nahin paae
 According to sources, in the case of Antagarh by-election, Jogi suggested not to give ticket to Manturam first as a strategy, while Manturam was his most trusted
 aise main baghel ko laga ki manturam ko tikat diya jaae to usase jogi camp ko tod denge
 But the tactics of the Jogi camp consumed Baghel
 paison ke lenden main vaadakhilaphi tepe ke saarvajanik hone kii vajah bani
 Talking to India Today, former Chief Minister Jogi says, "another tape has surfaced, in which Baghel and Feroze have a conversation
" usamen is tepe (manturam vaala) ko banane kii taiyaari kii gai
 "on the recommendation of expelling the Congress, he says," On the tree which has more fruit, people throw stones at it
 jo log meraa rajnatik rup se sidhaa saamana nahin kar paae, ve log farji tepe ko hathiyaar bana rahe hai

 andruni ladaai se nipatane ke baad ham aage kii ranneeti banaaenge
 “jogi-raman relationship There is a general perception in Chhattisgarh that the Jogi faction has an important role behind the hat-trick of the Raman government
 is dharna ke peeche isaki prishthbhumi he
 The BJP has been raising the issue of not being tribal since the time of undivided Madhya Pradesh in 1996
 jab chhattisgarh rajya bana or jogi pehle mukhyamantri bane to bijepi ne nakli adivasee ko mukhyamantri banane ko chunavi mudda banaaya
 Then there was a complaint with the Scheduled Tribes Commission and the report in 2001 said that Jogi's caste is not tribal
 lekin jogi ne hycourt se ste le liya
 In 2003 Assembly Election, again this issue was made and BJP came to power
 tab bhi jogi ne vidhayakon kii kharid-farokht kii koshish kii, lekin tepe kaa khulaasa ho gaya or congress ne jogi ko nilambit kar diya
 Then the Raman government also filed the same affidavit in the High Court which was filed during the Jogi government
 haalanki kota vidhansabha ke upachunaav main jogi kii patni renu jogi ke ummidavaar banane ke baad raman sarkaar ne hadabadi main doosraa halafanama daakhil kar kaha ki jogi adivasee samaaj se nahin hai
 In October 2011, the Supreme Court ordered Jogi's caste to be examined by a high-powered committee, which was to be completed in 90 days
 lekin cameti ne visilence cameti banaai jisaki report bhi 2013 main jogi ke khilaaf ai
 In December 2013, the Raman government withdrew the Vigilance report
 ise jogi ke saath saudebaaji ke taur par dekha gaya
 Sant Kumar Netam, a member of the National Executive of the BJP Scheduled Tribe Front, who has filed a petition in the case, alleges, "raman Singh and Jogi have a nexus so Jogi is being saved
" ” ve apni hi sarkaar par pratadia kaa bhi aarope laga rahe hai
 According to Netam, his wife Ira has been removed from the post of the superintendent of the girls hostel, against whom he will soon move the court
 haalanki jogi or bijepi, donon santhganth ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hai
 Says Jogi, "there is a common courtesy relationship with the Raman family, politically they are our biggest enemies

 i had promised to get the payment, but did not give it, which has inflicted a debt on me

" duusari ore raman ke damaad dow
 The alleged involvement of Puneet Gupta has definitely increased the bjp's problems of morality
 sutron ke mutabik, kendriya netritv or sangh isse naaraaz he
 The BJP has always been making an issue against Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra against the Congress, but more or less the same situation is being faced by the BJP due to Raman's son-in-law in Chhattisgarh
 amit jogi, punit jogi or abhishek kaa aapas main acha sambandh bataaya jaataa he
 After Abhishek and Amit entered active politics, the closeness between the two political families increased
 bijepi ke ek netaa yah bhi maanate hai ki jogi se najdiki kii vajah raman kii siyaasi ranneeti thi jisamen unhen andaja ho gaya tha ki bijepi-sangh ke sabhi aanushanbik sanghathan milakar bhi soobe main sameekaran ko bijepi ke liye mufeed nahin bana sakate, isliye unhone jogi ko saadhane kii koshish kii
 Jogis are considered to be of Satnami society, while they claim themselves to be tribal and are Christian by religion
 yah mail jogi ke janaadhar ko or majboot karata he
 The alleged role of Raman's son-in-law in this tape scandal is also being confirmed
 haalanki kowshik kehete hai, “doctor ke naate punit ke jogi se kya sambandh the, vahi jaane, lekin ham maanate hai ki punit bijepi ke sadsy nahin hai, isliye karrwai kii baat nahin he
 The reliability of the tape has also not been proved yet
 ” haalanki congress gupta ko nilambit karne kii maang kar rahi he
 Raman Singh and his son-in-law kept on talking about the whole issue despite constant contact
 lekin mukhyamantri ke karibiyon kaa kahana he ki agar mahasamund loksabhaa seat se jogi jeet jate to bhi kaha jaataa ki raman singh ne jitavaaya he, lekin haarane par aisa kyon nahin kehete
 Surely the tapcand is the result of the battle for supremacy in the Congress, but for the first time in 12 years, Raman Singh is directly targeted because of the son-in-law and the Congress is planning a statewide agitation for action against Puneet Gupta

 ) Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that nationalism is the identity of the BJP and the party has to follow this path
 modi ne party kii kor cameti kii meeting main agenda set kar diya he
 Modi said that some forces are working against the unity and integrity of the country
 aise main tirangaa yatra ne rashtrawaad kaa bhav majboot karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 Know, what were the reasons that Modi and the party had to make an agenda to follow the path of nationalism

 Modi has asked to stand against spreading ideas about increasing atrocities on Dalits and weaker sections
 vidhansabha chunaavon par bijepi kii najaraparty kii najar ab upi, punjab or gujarat main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon par he
 In these elections, the party has dreamed of victory like Lok Sabha elections
 do saal pehle party kii record jeet main bhi rashtrawaad kii ahm bhoomika rahi thi
 That is why Modi wants the party to stick to this message and agenda
 samaaj ke sabhi tabakon ke saath chalane ko taiyaramtaur par bijepi kii chhavi ek sampradayik party ke taur par rahi he
 Encouraged by the overwhelming victory in the Lok Sabha elections, the party had to face the loss in the Bihar Assembly elections
 vipakshi dalon ne aarakshan or sampradayikta ke mudde par bijepi ke khilaaf jamkar prachaar kiya
 BJP now wants to change the image already made among the people towards it and people should feel that this party is going to take all sections of the society together

 The neighboring country is a craze to build a dam on China, but recently its tune got a shock in Myanmar
 myanmar ke apane ilaake main vivaadaaspad chini baandh pariyojna rukvane ke joardaar faisle ne kai mahatvapurn ghatnaon ke liye prerak kaa kaam kiya he, jinamein aadhi sadi se bhi zyada arase baad myanmar main kisi america videsh mantri kaa pehla daura shaamil he
 Despite this, China remains the world's largest dam manufacturer at home and abroad
 kisi bhi desh ne china se zyada baandh nahin banaae hai
 The fact is that the number of dams in China is more than the total dams worldwide
 1949 main communiston ke satta main aane se pehle tak china main mahaj 22 baandh hua karte the
 But today more than half of the 50,000 large dams around the world are in China
 bade shrenee ke baandhon kii oonchai kam se kam 15 meter yaa unke jal sangrah kii kshamta 30 lakh ghan meter se zyada hoti he
 This feat means that China has built an average dam every day since 1949
 agar sabhi aakaar ke baandhon ko gina jaae to china main unki sankhya 85,000 ke paar ja pahonchegi
 Another tremendous fact is that China is the global leader in dams exports
 aaj akele uski sarkari companiyaan duusare tamaam antarrashtriya baandh nirmaataaon se kahin zyada baandhon kaa nirmaan kar rahi hai
 At least 37 Chinese financial and corporate entities are involved in more than 100 major dam projects in developing countries
 darasal china kii ''aantarik maamalon main dakhlandaji na karne'' kii niti se use aisi baandh pariyojnaayen taiyaar karne kaa vastutah license mil jaataa he, jisase duusare deshon main ethnic alpsankhyak ilaake main baadh tabaahi machaati he or log beghar hote he
 Similarly, he is focusing on the international rivers originating from the Tibetan plateau, Sikyang, Central Mongolia and Manchuria, rather than the overflowing dams in his country
 china kii daleel he ki baandh niryaat ke maamle main uski global leader kii bhoomika se mejabaan deshon or unki companiyon ke liye ''phaayde hi phaayde'' hai
 But the evidence from many project sites shows that those dams are going to be very expensive
 asia, africa or dakshin america main vibhinn jagahon par buniyadi str par virodh pradarshnon se jaahir hota he ki vastav main ye pariyojnaayen praayah china virdohi bhavanaaen hi bhadkaa rahi hai
 In fact, China takes most of its workers from other countries for dams or other projects in other countries — contrary to its own 2006 rules that called for "localization" - which reinforces this sentiment That he indulges in exploitative antics
 kuch pariyojnaon main chini mujarimon ko majdoor ke taur par istemaal kiya gaya lekin behad garib or kamjor desh ke log iskaa virodh nahin kar paae
 As the country with the most dams, China has become the world's largest producer of hydroelectricity
 uski sthapit utpaadan kshamta 170 gigawatt se bhi zyada he
 But his ambition to create hydroelectricity by building dams on international rivers has led to water disputes with almost all neighboring countries, not even North Korea
 vyapak taur par kahen to china ke baandh nirmaan ke shauk se do badi ghatnaayen hui hai
 First, Chinese companies are now dominant in the worldwide hydroelectric equipment export market
 or duusari, china main sarkari panbizli udyog ke badhate dabadabe kii vajah se beijing duusari sarkaron ko aakarshak, kam byaaj dar par karj dekar videsh main baandh pariyojnaayen hasil karne kii bharpoor koshish kar rahaa he
 It has recently planned to invest $ 635 billion in water infrastructure in its country over the next decade
 isamen se ek-tihaai se zyada rakam baandhon, jalaashyon or aapurti ke duusare dhaanche taiyaar karne main kharch kii jaaegi
 China's ecosystem has deteriorated due to the need to build more dams on the rivers and divert the water of the rivers and basins due to which the rivers are drying up and due to which the exploitation of ground water is increasing more and more
 isaki saamaajik keemat isse bhi zyada he
 Prime Minister Wen Jiabao admitted in 2007 that 2 since 1949 for the sake of water projects
 29 karod logon ko visthapit kiya gaya, jo australia, romania yaa chile kii aabaadi se bhi zyada he
 More than 3,50,000 people have been displaced since then, mostly poor villagers
 is tarah sarkari aankadon ke mutabik, jal pariyojnaon kii khatir pichley 62 saal ke dauraan har roj 1,035 logon ko jabaran darbadar kiya gaya
 Beijing is building dams on international rivers such as Mekong, Brahmaputra, Irtish, Illy and Amur
 aise main unheen vipadaaon ke 'niryaat' kaa khatra he jisase china kii apni nadiyaan jujh rahi hai
 The time has come to pressurize Beijing to stop the dam-making craze and meet international environmental standards

 In the Indian freedom struggle, Sukhdev Thapar is a name who is known not only for his patriotism, courage and sacrifice on his motherland, but also as a unique friend of martyr A
 Azam Bhagat Singh
 britania hukumat ko apni krantikari gatividhiyon se dahala dene vaale sukhdev kaa janm 15 may 1907 ko punjab ke ludhiana shahar main hua tha
 From his childhood, he saw the oppression of the British rule in India and this was why he became a revolutionary to break the chains of slavery
 jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke professor evam krantikariyon par kai pustaken likh chuke chaman laal ke anusaar hindustan socialist republican association ke sadsy sukhdev ke man main deshbhakti kii bhaavana kuta-kuta kar bhari thi
 He instilled a sense of patriotism among the youth at the National College in Lahore and inspired them to dive into the freedom movement
 ek kushal netaa ke rup main vah college main padhane vaale chaatro ko bharat ke gauravshaalee ateet ke bare main bhi bataaya karte the
 He along with other revolutionary colleagues started the Naujawan Bharat Sabha in Lahore
 yah ek aisa sanghathan tha jo yuvakon ko swatantraaa andolan main shaamil hone ke liye prerit karata tha
 According to historian Malati Malik, Sukhdev not only worked to instill patriotism in the youth, but also actively participated in revolutionary activities
 unka naam 1928 kii us ghatana ke liye pramukhataa se janaa jaataa he jab krantikariyon ne lala lajpat raay kii maut kaa badla lene ke liye gori hukumat ke kaarinde police upaadheekshak jepi sanders ko maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 This incident shook the British Empire and revolutionaries were cheered all over the country
 sanders kii hatya ke maamle ko ‘lahore shadyantr’ ke rup main janaa gaya
 In this case Rajguru, Sukhdev and Bhagat Singh were sentenced to death
 23 march 1931 ko teenon krantikari hansate-hansate faansee ke fande par jhul gaye or desh ke yuvaaon ke man main aazaadee paane kii nayi lalak paidaa kar gaye
 Sukhdev was only 24 years old at the time of martyrdom
 halke nile rang kii vardi main security guard ramadhani yadav mahabodhi mandir main police kii badhati upasthiti se pareshaan hai
 Looking at the two dozen personnel of the Bihar Military Police to protect the temple after one, ten blasts on Sunday, Yadav says, "hopefully, they will not take our jobs
" '' gaya jile main bela gaanv ke ramadhani yadav ne kai saal dhanbad main koyala vyapaaree ke getman kii naukari karne ke baad is saal may main hi 4,000 ru

 Not all of them are properly educated

 The Bodhgaya Temple Stewardship Committee (BTMC) has the responsibility of managing the Mahabodhi Temple under the Bodh Gaya Temple Act 1949
 usne mandir kii bhitari suraksha kaa theka maamuli-si privet security agency cobra ko de rakhaa tha
 While recruiting Yadav, Cobra gave him uniform and sleeping space as well as one day training to teach salute and after so much training, he was posted on the inner security of the temple
 mahabodhi mandir kii suraksha ke liye kam vetan or kamjor training vaale security guard kii tainaati to is baat kii sirf ek misaal he ki suraksha ke dhaanche kaa ladkadaana bihar sarkaar ke shikhar se shuru hua or rajya ke grih vibhaag, police mukhyalay, bodhgaya police or beatiemasi tak dhwast hota chalaa gaya
 When Nitish Kumar reached Bodh Gaya a few hours after the Sunday blasts, he knew how security was breached
 unhone turant siif se suraksha maangi
 In a conversation with the media in Bodh Gaya, Nitish refused to consider the blasts as the result of security lapses
 lekin sawaal yah he ki khufia jaankaree milte hi unhone siif kii tainaati kii maang kyon nahin kii thi
 The Mahabodhi Temple Center is not included in the protected monuments so its security has not been handed over to the CISF
 iske alaava mandir kaa sanchaalan beatiemasi ke haath main hone kii vajah se mandir kii suraksha main bharat ke puraatatv surveykshan (ees) vibhaag kaa koi dakhal nahin he
 BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi says, "nitish Kumar cannot blame anyone else

 Being the state's Home and Tourism Minister, the Chief Minister is responsible for the security of the Mahabodhi Temple
 '' nitish kumaar sarkaar pehle se jaanati thi ki mahabodhi mandir kitna khatre main he or indian mujahiddin (iem) ke aatanki use nishaanaa banane ke liye kitne betaab hai
 In October 2012, the then Senior Superintendent of Police of Gaya, Vinay Kumar was called to Delhi in connection with the interrogation of Asad Khan, Imran Khan, Saeed Feroz alias Hamza and Irfan Mustafa
 dilli police ne in chaaron ko agast, 2012 main pune visphot ke silsile main pakadaa tha
 The four had then confessed that their Indian Mujahideen accomplice Saeed Maqbool alias Zubair had planned to attack temples in Bodh Gaya to avenge the alleged excesses on Muslims in Myanmar
 makabool to hyderabad main giraftaar ho gaya lekin mahabodhi mandir par indian mujahiddeen ke hamale kii ashanka bani rahi kyonki yah bhatkal bandhuon kii yojana main shaamil tha
 Vinay Kumar had sent a report to the government about this and he was transferred from Gaya in March this year
 intelegence beuro ne isi saal march main duusari baar aatanki hamale kii sambhaavna kii soochna bihar ko di thi
 It was told that two men of Indian Mujahideen had entered the state to bomb the crowded places and it was specifically targeted in Patna
 ibi kii gopneey soochna main daawa kiya gaya tha ki donon aatankwaadi siraphire hai or ve khun se lathpath laashon kaa majaa lenaa chaahate hai
 The serial blasts in Bodh Gaya on Sunday suggest that the information was not taken seriously
 paanch dhamaake mahabodhi mandir parisar ke bheetar hue, teen tergar math main hue jahaan kareeb 200 prashikshu bhikshu rahete hai or ek-ek dhamaakaa 80 foot kii buddha pratimaa ke paas or bypass ke kareeb bas stand par hue

 The current committee was formed in 2008
 2011 main use doosraa kaarykaal de diya gaya
 a senior IPS officer in Patna said that handing over security of the Mahabodhi temple to novices was a gross negligence of the state government
 aatanki hamale kii ashanka kii pakki soochna milane ke baad bhi surahna prabandh kii jimmedaari beatiemasi ke haath main rakhana sarkaar or jila prashasan kii bhayankar bhul he
 For this, only BTMC cannot be made a scapegoat
 jinhone use niyukt kiya tha, asli jimmedaari unheen kii banati he
 Highlighting the inefficiency of the BTMC, the Inspector General of Police of Gaya, Nayyar Hasnain Khan, in a meeting to review the security on July 3, recommended that the committee's guards be given full training as they do not even find a metal detector

 Nitish Sarkar has proved to be largely unacceptable about the implementation of the information on terrorist attacks because the perception was strong that Islamic terror groups recruit in Bihar and hence will not target him
 shaayad isiilie mandir par hamale ke bare main intelegence beuro kii ekadam spasht chetavanee milane ke baavjood bihar sarkaar soti rahi
 Since July 2006, various government agencies have arrested 16 people from Madhubani, Kishanganj and Darbhanga districts in Bihar for their involvement in various terror attacks
 inamen se 11 pichley do saal main pakade gaye hai
 The last such arrest was in May 2012, a year ago
 bangaloru main chinnaswami stadium main dhamaake ke silsile main karnataka police ne kapheel akhtar ko darbhanga se pakadaa tha
 The Chief Minister strongly opposed the arrest
 unka aarope tha ki giraftaar se pehle karnataka police ne sthaneey police se sampark nahin kiya
 Nitish's opposition to this may have earned him some sympathy from the minority community
 uske baad se bihar main koi giraftaar nahin hui he
 In the same month, Fasih Mahmood, a mechanical engineer from Sambila flooding Darbhanga, was arrested from Saudi Arabia on charges of terrorist contacts
 silsilewar dhamaakon ke teen din baad 15 sisitivi camaron se dhundhlee tasviren mili kyonki kisi main bhi nitevijan nahin tha

 So far, no success has been achieved
 rajya prashasan behad satark he or usne indian mujahiddeen kaa naam nahin liya he
 But the Andhra Pradesh ATS official present in Bodh Gaya told India Today that the way to carry out the whole conspiracy is similar to that of the Indian Mujahideen
 sisitivi camaron se mili tasveeron main najar aa rahe logon kii sahi pahchaan karne ke liye unhen atyaadhunik leboratories main bheja janaa he
 The cameras have the ability to hold only two days of footage and the police have only that clue

 The NIA has not been able to investigate unarmed bombs as they have been put up for production in court and need court permission to investigate them

 Now, apart from the blurred video footage, the results from mobile phones are supported
 lekin thodi der main jab usee gaadi main baithe satyendra jain waapas aaye to pataa chalaa satyendra jain mandir gaye the
 In fact, there is a Digambar Jain Temple, just a few kilometers away from Satyendar Jain's Civil Lines government house, where Satyendra Jain visits regularly every morning before leaving for work
 lekin buudhvaar ko mandir jane se pehle hi sibiai aa gai
 But even today, when Satyendra Jain asked the CBI to go to the temple, the CBI took him to see the temple
 ye ahm baat isliye he kyonki sibiai red ke dauraan aamtaur par dekha jaataa he ki jiske yahaan red ho rahi he wo apane ghar yaa daphtar main najarband se ho jaataa he baahar nahin nikal saktaa aise main dilli ke PWD or swasthya mantri satyendra jain sibiai red ke dauraan mandir jane vaale shaayad pehle shaks ban gaye hai
 This is important because during the CBI raid it is usually seen that the one who is raiding here, gets away from house arrest in his house or office, cannot get out in such a situation that Delhi PWD and Health Minister Satyendra Jain of CBI Red The temple is probably the first to go
