 gujarat ke vivaadaaspad soharabuddin muthbhed cond kii jaanch ab sibiai karegi
 The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the case to be handed over to the CBI
 nyaayamurti tarun chatarji or nyaayamurti aftab alam kii peeth ne gujarat police ke saath kathith farji muthbhed main maare gaye soharabuddin shaikh ke bhai kii yachika ke aadhaar par is maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kii maang sweekaar kar lee
 This decision of the Supreme Court has taken a major blow to the BJP government of Gujarat, which has been consistently saying that its Special Investigation Team (SIT) is investigating the matter impartially
 kareeb chaar saal pehle jab soharabuddin kaa encounter hua tha us vakt daawa kiya gaya tha ki wo mukhyamantri modi kii hatya kii sajeesh rach rahaa tha lekin soharabuddin ke parivaar waalon ne jab adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataya to is maamle main gujarat police kii bhoomika par sawaal khadey ho gaye
 The sensational news came on 26 November 2005, Gujarat Police's Anti Terrorism Squad and Rajasthan Police killed Lashkar terrorist Sohrabuddin Sheikh in an encounter
 gujarat police ne daawa kiya ki soharabuddin gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii hatya kii sajeesh rach rahaa tha
 But in the eyes of Sohrabuddin's family, the encounter was fake
 shaq isliye bhi badha kyonki soharabuddin kii patni kausar bi or unke dost tulsiram prajapati kaa kahin ata-pataa nahin tha
 The case caught fire
 soharabuddin sheikh ke bhai rababuddin ne supreme court kaa daravaaza khatkhataya
 The trial began and the truth came out layer by layer
 jaanch main pataa chalaa ki soharabuddin muthbhed cond ke do din baad hi kausar bi or tulsiram prajapati ko bhi maar diya gaya tha
 The Gujarat government had to admit in court that the encounter was fake
 itnaa bada khulaasa hone ke baad bhala wo adhikari kaise batch sakate the, jinhone is farji muthbhed ko anjaam diya tha
 DIG DG Vanzara, SP Rajkumar Pandian and SP MN Dinesh who led the encounter were arrested and are still in jail
 iske alaava das anya log bhi aaropee hai
 The day of judgment has arrived

 '' pradhanmantri ko bhi lokapal ke daayre main aane kii baat kehete huye bhaajapa netaa rajnath singh ne kaha ki pehle lokapal vidheyak sansad main aaye to ham dekhenge ki isamen kya shaamil kiya gaya he or phir apane pattey kholenge
 Rajnath Singh, who came to participate in a program organized on the banks of the Ganges in Bithoor, city, as part of the Ganga Rescue Yatra of BJP leader Uma Bharti, said that on Sunday, the Prime Minister had called an all-party meeting on the issue of Lokpal and all the NDA constituents participated in it
 Were
 unhone kaha ki unka maananaa he ki pradhanmantri ko bhi lokapal ke daayre main aana chaiye
 When the NDA government was at the Center, the Lokpal Bill, made during the tenure of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was made, in which the Prime Minister was placed under its purview
 unhone kaha ki unki party kii manshaa he ki ek nishpaksh or sahi vyakti hi lokapal chunakar aaye or iske chayan ke liye ek sahi prakriya apanaai jaye
 When asked whether the judiciary should be included within the ambit of Lokpal, he said that it is a matter of consideration
 abhi sansad main lokapal vidheyak aane dijiye
 Then we will discuss each aspect of it, only then we will speak and we will open our cards there
 anna hajaare or baba ramdev ke bare main sawaal puche jane par unhone taalte huye kaha ki bharat kaa kaala dhan jo videshon main jamaa he uskaa desh main waapas aane se koi nahin roak saktaa he
 AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party from the platform of Aaj Tak's Mumbai Manthan
 unhone bijepi or sangh par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki mere purvajon ne kabhi na angrejon se maafee or na hi maafeename par dastakhat kiye
 Owaisi said the bjp's slogan that Muslims are children of Babur has been 1200 years of slavery
 bijepi abhi bhi gulaami ke daur se nahin nikali he
 He said that your party (BJP) did not say what about the Red Fort, but even today the tricolor has to be wavered from there
 unhone bijepi par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki agar aap mughalon se achche hai to ek tajmahal banavaa do, petrol sasta kar do, dijal sasta kar do
 The AIMIM chief said that the British built my house but my elders never wrote an apology to the British nor did they beg for their lives
 unhone kaha ki aapaki party ne lalakile ke bare main kya-kya nahin kaha lekin aaj bhi tirangaa vahiin se laharaana padataa he
 If you are better than the Mughals, build a Taj Mahal, make petrol cheaper, make diesel cheaper
 meraa ghar angrejon ne banaaya lekin mere bujurgon ne kabhi angrejon ko maafinama nahin likhaa or naa hi unase jaan kii bheekh maangi
 Actually, there were discussions between the two leaders on buildings built in India by other Mughals including Babur
 tabhi shahanvaj ne kaha ki babar baahar ke desh se hamaare yahaan aayaa, isliye ham use apana nahin maanate hai
 If someone will build Taj Mahal, Red Fort, will we give it to our country? bijepi netaa ne kaha ki angrejon ne sansad banaai lekin iskaa matlab ye nahin ham unhen apana desh hi saunp den
 He said that the person who attacked Somnath was in love with India
 mughalon ne agar tajmahal banavaane kaa order de diya, lekin use banaaya to hinduon ne hi tha
 But did we become his servants

 team india ke coach ko lekar somvaar ko dinabhar chali maathapai ke baad press conferes cricket adwijuri council (siesi) ke sadsy saurav ganguli ne kaha ki ravi shastri, sahvaag samet 5 logon kaa intervyuu liya gaya
 But after the players are negotiated, a decision will be taken on the name of one
 philhal unhone iske liye koi taarikh mukarrar nahin kii he
 But in his statements, Ganguly gave big hints
 1
 The selection process for the coach position has been completed
 ab ham team india ke captain viraat kohli se baatcheet karenge or unhen team india ke coach kii bhoomika kii bare main bataaenge
 That is, the choice of Kohli has not been approved by the CAC
 isliye aaj naam kaa elaan nahin ho paaya
 2
 coach ke naam ko lekar kohli ne koi input nahin diya tha
 Now we will tell all the players of Team India about their decision and take their opinion
 3
 In a way, Ganguly said that he will talk to all the members of Team India including Kohli about the coach
 vahiin duusari tarah se unhone press conference main saaf kar diya ki chayan prakriya puri chuki he
 That is, only the players will give their decision
 aise main sambhav tha ki agar ravi shastri ke naam par sahmati banati to aaj hi elaan kar diya jaataa
 4
 chayan samiti ke ahm sadsy saurav ganguli ne bataaya ki coach kaa chayan bhavishya ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiya ja rahaa he
 The entire focus of the CAC is on the next World Cup 2019
 ganguli ne kaha ki srilanka daura ahm he lekin coach kaa chunaav is daure ko dhyaan main rakhkar nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 5
 press conference main ganguli kii baton se laga ki wo ravi shastri ke naam par sahamat nahin hai isliye khilaadiyon se baatcheet kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 If we decode this thing of Sourav, then it is clear that out of those who gave interviews for the coach last year, only Ravi Shastri is beating this time

 After agreeing on the names of 145 candidates, PM Modi, Amit Shah, Vijay Rupani and state BJP President Jeetu Vaghani held a meeting for about 50 minutes and decided that the names of their candidates should not be announced yet
 uske baad amit shah ne apni ranneeti main kuch badlaav kiya he
 Before announcing the names of its candidates, BJP once again wants to give a big shock to the Congress by breaking them close to Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakor and Jignesh Mevani and joining them in the BJP
 bijepi netritv hardik kii sidi aane ke baad patidaar samaaj kaa rukh hardik ko lekar kaisaa rahegaa us par bhi nazar banaae hue hai
 The way in which the Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has campaigned in Gujarat in recent days and tried to create an atmosphere in favor of the Congress, after this the streak of worry is clearly visible on the forehead of BJP
 pehali barabijepi gujarat chunaavamein congress ke ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa intazaar kar rahi he
 If sources are to be believed, the BJP will announce the names of its candidates only after the Congress announcement
 bataa den ki congress 17 november ko gujarat chunaav ke liye ummidavaaron ke naamon par baithak karegi
 Let us know that the last date for nomination of 89 seats in the first phase of 19 districts in Gujarat is 21 November
 isliye bijepi ke paas abhi apane ummidavaaron ke naam kii ghoshnaa karne ke liye samay he
 On the other hand, the last date for nomination of 93 seats of the second phase is 27 November
 bijepi kii sabase badi chintaa saurashtra kii un 54 siton par he, jahaan patidaaron kaa garh he
 The last time the BJP won 35 out of 54 seats in Saurashtra, but after the Patidar movement, the BJP leadership seems to have changed the situation this time

 Winning the Gujarat elections is also important for the BJP because PM Modi's model of development is Gujarat
 agar neenv hill gai to vikaas model dhwast hone main der nahin lagegi
 Therefore, PM Modi and Amit Shah will not miss using every arrow in their quiver to win Gujarat elections

 Can any 'rat' in that jail ever sweat a prison administration! This is not a joke, but the truth

 a prisoner returned to jail after his appearance in court
 jail vine se utaarne ke baad use kadi suraksha main jail ke get ke bheetar le liya gaya
 The prison staff searched him
 tab uske paas se kuch bhi sandigdh nahin mila
 According to highly placed sources in Tihar Jail, as soon as the prison security personnel took the prisoner to the 'security-pole', his eyes were astonished
 achaanak suraksha-pole se alert karne vaali aawaaj aane lagi
 Troubled by this, jail security personnel suspected themselves
 unhone sochaa ki kaidi kii jama-talaashi lene main ve jane-anjaane koi bhul to nahin kar chuke hai
 Therefore, other jail security personnel present on the spot also investigated the suspected prisoner in depth
 is sabake baavjood 'alert-alarm' shant nahin hua
 As soon as the accused is taken to the security pole, he starts pointing out to the jail staff that the suspect has some 'suspect'
 jab kai ghante mashkkat ke baad bhi 'suraksha-pole' shant nahin hua, to jail surakshakarmiyon kaa baichaiyn hona lajimi tha
 Soon after the jail authorities were told the whole incident

 It is suspected that there may be something hidden inside the body of the alleged prisoner 'rat', who is not getting caught from outside
 iske baad sandigdh ko turant kadi suraksha main dilli ke guru teg bahadur aspataal le jaaya gaya
 When it came to the fact that parts of the body would now have to be operated to remove the suspicious thing hidden in the body, the suspected prisoner became a 'rat' in fear in front of the team of jail officers and doctors
 usne sara rajfash khud hi kar diya
 The suspect said, 'there is a' surgical blade 'used by doctors in his stomach
 usne pehle blade ke upar doctor tepe lagaai
 Then swallowed it with water

 What illegality was the accused to use the blade inside the prison? It has not been revealed at the moment

 My son is immaculate
 yah clinit, rashtriya janata dal adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ne apane bade bete tejpratap yadav ko unke janmdin ke avasar par diya
 Recently, senior Bihar BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi alleged that Tej Pratap Yadav bought land for an auto show room and then took a loan from the bank
 lekin is baat kaa zikr na hi unke chunavi shapath-patr main hai or na hi mantriyon kii vaarshik sampatti ke byore main
 However, neither Tej Pratap Yadav nor Lalu Prasad Yadav had given any response to this charge for a long time
 ravivaar ko tej pratap yadav ke janmdin ke avasar par media se mukhaatib lalu ne na keval unhen bedaag bataaya balki yahaan tak kah daalaa ki tejpratap bilkul dharmik vichaar kaa he, sahaj hai
 Boys are just like flowers
 bedaag ladke hai or lalu yadav ne daawa bhi kiya ki in log ko baraabar sikh dete rahete hai
 On this occasion, Rashtriya Janata Dal's Bihar unit president Ramchandra East presented to Geeta Tej Pratap
 lalu yadav ne is par kaha ki tejpratap krishnabhakt hai or vrindavan, mathura sab jagah gaye hai
 For this, a copy of Gita has been presented in view of his interest in Gita
 haalanki lalu yadav ne ye bhi daawa kiya ki ab tejpratap krishna ke alaava sai baba kii bhi aradhana karte hai
 At the same time, Rabri Devi said that the people of Bihar have given blessings, so today Tej Pratap Yadav has got the burden of two-two ministry
 tippaniyan Despite Lalu Yadav's clean chit, his supporters also believe that unless Lalu Yadav is given a systematic response to the allegations made by Modi, there is no point in saying anything
 haalanki party pravaktaa ab susheel modi par unki sampatti ko lekar hamalaa karte hai lekin abhi tak party dwaara aisi koi jaankaree nahin di gai jisase lage ki modi ne tejpratap yadav kii tarah apni sampatti kaa khulaasa saarvajanik rup se nahin kiya tha
 Meanwhile, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu is arriving in Patna on Monday and it is expected that he will give his first reaction on the issue of giving land to Lalu Yadav in return for the railway hotel
 haalanki railway ke adhikari kehete hai ki hotel ke tender main koi aniyamitata nahin hui lekin agar usee hotel ke maalik kii jameen lalu yadav ko mili hai jinke kaarykaal main hotel diya gaya tab nishchit rup se sawaal utana lijimi hai
 On Sunday, on the occasion of Tej Pratap Yadav's birthday, Mukhtib Lalu from the media not only described him as immaculate but even said that Tej Pratap is of a purely religious view and is comfortable
 ekadam phool jaise ladke hai
 There are immaculate boys and Lalu Yadav also claimed that they continue to teach these people equally
 is avasar par rashtriya janata dal ke bihar ikai ke adhyaksh ramchandra purvi dwaara gita tejpratap ko bhent kii gai
 Lalu Yadav said that Tej Pratap is a devotee of Krishna and has gone to Vrindavan, Mathura everywhere
 iske liye gita main unki ruchi ke maddenjar gita kii ek copy bhent di gai he
 However, Lalu Yadav also claimed that Tejapratap now worship Sai Baba in addition to Krishna
 vahiin rabari devi kaa kahana tha ki bihar kii janata ne aashirwad diya he isliye do-do mantralay kaa bhaar aaj tejpratap yadav ko mila he
 The comments lalu yadav ke clinit ke baavjood unke samarthak bhi maanate hai ki jab tak modi dwaara lagaae gaye aaropon kaa silsilewar dhang se jawaab nahin diya jaataa lalu yadav ke kuch bhi kehane kaa koi matlab nahin
 Though party spokespersons now attack Sushil Modi for his wealth, but no information has been given by the party so far that Modi did not disclose his assets publicly like Tejapratap Yadav

 Though railway officials say that there was no irregularity in the tender of the hotel, but if the land of the owner of the same hotel has been given to Lalu Yadav, during whose tenure the hotel was given, then surely the question is as much legal

 Delhi BJP called on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to sort out the gaps of GST, so that he can get the Delhi tax workers and business leaders exposed to this new tax by solving the complexities of GST
 talkatoraa stadium main dilli bijepi ne dilli sambodhan naam se ek kaarykram kiya, jisamen jiesti se judi ashankaon or jaankariyon ko lekar vitt mantri kii paathshaala lagaai gai
 On 6 July, the birth anniversary of Jana Sangh leader Shyama Prasad Mukherjee takes place, due to which a large picture of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was placed on the stage
 teacher ban is paathshaala main pahunche vitt mantri arun jetali ne dilli bijepi ke vyapaar prakoshth ke netaaon or duusare kaaryakartaaon ko ek ek karke jiesti ke phaayde bataae or samajhaayaa ki puure desh main ek tex kaise kaam karegaa
 According to Jaitley, earlier there were 17 taxes for trade across the country and 23 types of cess were levied on it, but after the introduction of GST, now there will be a kind of tax in the entire country
 jetali ke mutabik jiesti kii sabase badi kamyaabi isaki saral prakriya he
 Which is also easy for the traders and beneficial for the customers
 arun jetali ke mutabik desh main sabhi rajyon ne is jiesti par apni sahmati di he or ek hajaar se zyada vastuon kii keemton par bhi rajamandi di he
 This is the first time when the governments of the whole country are giving consensus on such a big list
 jetali ke mutabik jiesti ke jariye desh kaa aarthik ekikaran hua he
 To listen to Jaitley's GST knowledge, the BJP had invited its workers from all over Delhi, besides the mps and Union ministers of Delhi also joined it
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke mutabik ab jin kaaryakartaaon ne jetali se jiesti kii baarikiyaan sikhi hai unhen lekar wo apane apane ilaake main logon ko bhi samajhaayenge taaki jiesti ko lekar jo ashankaayen bani hui hai unhen dur kiya ja sake
 That is why Congress withdrew from GST, the joy of GST implementation in the entire country was clearly visible on Arun Jaitley's face and he said in his speech that politically India had already become one but now there is one in the whole country including Jammu and Kashmir
 Economic integration has also taken place after the country enacted a tax
 jetali ne kaha ki jiesti kii vyavastha aisi he ki agar koi rajya isse apane aap ko alag rakhata to use iskaa nuksaan uthaanaa padataa or vahaan par chijen baaki desh kii tulana main mahangi ho jaatin
 Explaining in detail about the long journey to implement it from the imagination of GST, Jaitley said that now the traders all over the country have to pay only one tax and they will be able to avoid harassment in the name of tax everywhere
 unhone kaha ki alag-alag rajyon main alag-alag tareeke ke tex utpeedan ourabhrashtacharki badi vajah ban gaye the lekin jiesti ke tahat or vyapaariyon ko tex adhikariyon se darane kii koi jarurat nahin hogi kyonki isamen bhrashtachar kaa koi mauka hi nahin hoga
 Attacking the Congress, Jaitley said that the Congress party was involved in every process from the passing of the GST bill to the implementation of GST rates
 lekingstilagu hone ke vakt congress ne paanv peeche khinch liye kyonki shaayad unhen dar tha jiesti lagu hone se afra tafari much jaaegi or iskaa khamiyaja sarkaar ke saath hone bhi bhugatna padegaa
 But after the implementation of GST, it has become clear that there is no chaos and everything is going on very smoothly

 Hardly anyone has heard this full name, but the face of the five-time world champion, the Indian boxer, swims before his eyes as MC Mary Kom says
 
 
 , who hails from Kangathei, Manipur and has won the country's highest sporting honor 'rajiv Gandhi Khelratna', has a world ranking of eight, but Mary Kom has been a five-time world champion Huh
 
 
 unki saadagi dekhakar bhi yakeen karnaa mushkil he ki unki uplabdhiyaan itani oonchi hai, lekin yah jaanakar usase bhi zyaada hairaani hoti he ki ve judawaan bacchon kii maa bhi hai
 
 
 When she returned in 2008 after taking a two-year break to become a mother, she won the gold medal for the fourth time at the World Championships held in Ningbo City, China, and surprised the world
 
 
 vaise varsh 2009 main 'rajeev gandhi khelratna' se sammanit kiye jane se pehle unhen varsh 2003 main hi arjuna puraskaar pradaan kiya gaya tha, or varsh 2006 main padmashri se sammanit kiya gaya
 
 
 After his return, he also won gold in the Asian Boxing Championship held in Mongolia in 2011, and this year, ie, in 2012 Asian Boxing Championship in China, he also won the gold number one
 
 
 tippaniyan It can be easily said that the Olympics have included women's boxing for the first time, otherwise we might have had some more Olympic gold
 
 
 antarrashtriya boxing sangh ke adhyaksh ching−ko−vu to yahaan tak kehete hai ki 'magniphicent meri com' kii kamyaabiyon ke kaaran hi mahila boxing ko olympics main shaamil kiya gaya
 
 
 This time Mary Kom has taken training from British coach Charles Atkinson for the London Olympics
 
 
 landan olympics ke dauraan mairi com ko sabase badi chunauti china kii rain cancan or england kii nicola adams se milegi
 
 
 Cancun is currently world number-1, and Nicola number-2
 
 
 jab 5 agast ko landan main mahila boxing muqablon kii shuruyaat hogi, mairi com ke judawaan bachche apana paanchvaan janmdin manaa rahe honge
 
 
 And of course, the children would not want any less gift than the mother
 
 
 kangathei, manipur kii rahane vaali, or desh ke sabase bade khel sammaan 'rajeev gandhi khelratna' se nawazi ja chuki 51 kilogram bhaar-varg kii is 29-varshiya boxr kii world ranking aath he, lekin mairi com paanch baar world champion rah chuki hai
 
 
 Seeing their simplicity, it is difficult to believe that their achievements are so high, but it is even more surprising to know that they are also mothers of twins
 
 
 maa banane ke liye do saal kaa brake lene ke baad jab unhone varsh 2008 main vaapasi kii, china ke ningbo shahar main hui world championships main unhone chauthi baar gold medal jeeta, or duniya ko hairaan kar diya
 
 
 However, he was conferred with the Arjuna Award in the year 2003 before being conferred with 'rajiv Gandhi Khelratna' in 2009, and Padma Shri in the year 2006
 
 
 vaapasi ke baad varsh 2011 main mongolia main hui asian boxing championships main bhi unhone gold hi jeeta, or is saal, yani 2012 main china main hui asian boxing championships main bhi pehle number par rahakar swarna padak hasil kiya
 
 
 The comments aasaani se kaha ja saktaa he ki olympics main mahila boxing ko pehali baar shaamil kiya gaya he, varanaa hamaare paas shaayad kuch or olympics gold hote
 
 
 ching-ko-woo, the president of the International Boxing Federation, even goes on to say that women's boxing was included in the Olympics because of the success of 'magnificent Mary Kom'
 
 
 is baar landan olympics ke liye mairi com ne british coach charles atkinson se training lee he
 
 
 During the London Olympics, Mary Kom will face the biggest challenge from Rain Cancann of China and Nicola Adams of England
 
 
 cancan is samay world number−1 hai, or nicola number-2
 
 
 When women's boxing matches begin in London on 5 August, Mary Kom's twins will be celebrating their fifth birthday
 
 
 or zaahir he, bachche bhi maa se gold se kam koi gift nahin chahenge

 - GAUAHAR KHAN (@GAUAHAR_KHAN) November 23, 2014 team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ke ghar ranchi main aaj dopaher baad bharat-australia ke bich chauthaa vanade khelaa janaa he
 While Team India, trailing 1-2 on one side, will be under pressure to return to the series in the series after winning here, on the other hand, along with Ishant Sharma, there will be pressure on other bowlers to perform well in the death overs
 team india ab tak teenon vanade main samaan antim ekadash ke saath utari he lekin ab use gendbaaji main badlaav bhi karne par majaboor hona pad saktaa he
 The new technology pitch will be the key character, defending the target of 304 runs in the third ODI at Mohali, India was moving towards victory at a time when Australia needed 44 runs in the last three overs
 is match ke 48wein over main eshanth ne 30 ran lutaa die or match yaheen se australia ke paksh main mud gaya
 James Faulkner hit four sixes and a four in this over
 bhartiya ballebaaj acchhee farm main hai lekin gendbaajon ne niraash kiya he jinhone ab tak teenon vanade main 300 se adhik ran kharch kiye hai
 In this too, poor bowling in the death overs is the main concern of the team management in particular
 eshanth or aar vinay kumaar donon kaaphi mahange sabit hue hai or donon ne saat ran prati over se adhik se ran die hai
 Vinay Kumar however has been successful in getting wickets
 team ke tisare tej gendbaaj bhubaneshwar kumaar haalanki 5
 Have been 'affordable' with a run rate of 37
 mohali main niraashajanak 48wein over ke baad baad eshanth sharma ko aaj shaayad hi team main jagah mil sake
 He can be replaced by left-arm fast bowler Jaydev Unadkat
 ranchi ke bahari hisse dhurva ke jeessie stadium main spin gendbaajon ko madad mil sakati he or aise main sambhaavna he ki leg spinner amit mishra ko antim ekadash main jagah mili
 Ravindra Jadeja, who played a key role in India's victory by taking three wickets for 19 against England in the last international match played here nine months ago, will be expected to perform well on this ground once again
 donon chor se nayi gendon ke istemaal or paanch kii jagah sirf chaar kshetrarakshakon ke bich 30 gaj ke daayre se baahar khadey hone ke naye vanade niyamon se ballebaajon ko phayda mil rahaa hai
 So far 1864 runs have been scored in six innings of the series
 jaipur main duusare vanade main to shikhar dhawan, rohit sharma or viraat kohli ne austrailia ke 360 ran ke lakshya ko 44 over ke bheetar hasil kar liya tha
 The Indian middle order failed in Mohali
 team kaa score ek samay 76 ran par chaar or phir 154 ran par chah wicket ho gaya lekin dhoni ne 121 gend main naabad 139 ran kii pari khelkar team kaa score 300 ran se upar pahunchaa diya
 In the last ODI here, however, England's team was reduced to 155 runs in front of India's slow bowlers
 ab najar ranchi ki pich par he
 Although the curator of the pitch s
 bi
 Singh has told in a special conversation till date that this pitch, whether batsman or bowler, will prove to be helpful to all
 phir bhi yah dekhnaa mjedaar hoga ki ranchi main ran barasenge yaa phir lagegi viketon kii jhadi
 Indian batsmen are making a splash till now three Indian batsmen have scored centuries in the tournament
 rohit sharma ne jaipur main 2010 ke baad apana pehla shatak jamaaya jabaki viraat kohli shrinkhalaa main ek shatak or do ardhashatak jad chuke hai
 Dhoni also made a brilliant hundred in the last match
 team kii ballebaaj acchhee najar aa rahi he
 Yuvraj Singh, who is making a comeback, however, has failed to show his bat after playing an unbeaten 77 in the lone T20 and the left-handed batsman will land in Ranchi with the intention of removing this disappointment
 apane rang main he australian teamaustralia ne ab tak dikhaaya he ki vah bharat kii kisi bhi chunauti ke liye taiyaar he or ranchi main team apni badhat ko or majboot karne kii koshish karegi
 Due to the IPL, the Australian batsmen have no problem in facing the Indian bowlers
 aaron finch or philip huge ke rup main team ke paas aakraamak salaami jodi he jinhone team ko ab tak acchhee shuruyaat di he
 The middle order and the lower order also appear to be in good form
 bharat ke liye australia kii ballebaaji chintaa kii baat he
 Especially after the unbeaten 64 off 29 balls from James Faulkner, who came out to bat at number eight in Mohali
 australia ke gendbaajon ne bhi behatar pradarshan kiya he
 With the exception of Jaipur, his bowlers have been able to perform well
 mishael janson ne to mohali main 46 ran dekar chaar wicket chatkaaye the
 The bowlers like Johnson and Shane Watson have troubled the Indian batsmen due to their quickness and ability to bounce
 chotil maaikel clark kii gairmaujuudagi main team kii kaman sambhaal rahe australia ke tii20 captain george baili shandaar farm main hai or shrinkhalaa main ab tak team kii ore se sarvaadhik 220 ran bana chuke hai
 Teams are as follows: India: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, r Vinay Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Ambati Rayudu, Amit Mishra , Mohammed Shami and Jaydev Unadkat
 australia:george baili (captain), philip huge, aaron finch, shen watasan, adam vojes, glen maxwell, bread hadine, james fahonor, mishael janson, client maikaay, jevier doharty, nathan colter nil, calum fagyarusan or mices haderiks
 Timing: The match will start at half past one in Indian time

 It was a big responsibility for Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane as Shikhar Dhawan and KL Rahul were injured
 newjiland ke khilaaf vanade siries main team india ko rohit sharma or ajinkya rahane ko openar ke role main utaarna padaa
 Both of these experienced batsmen from Team India had the responsibility of giving the team a good start, but they have failed in the current series
 siries ke ab tak hue chaaron maichon main opening team india ke liye kamjor kadi sabit hui he
 In the Indian opener series, in any of the four matches, he could not make a century or a half-century partnership
 is siries main team india kii pehle wicket kii sabase badi saajhedaari 49 ran kii rahi jo dharmashala ke pehle vanade main hui
 Before the ODI series against New Zealand, there was a lot of hope from Rohit Sharma
 iske peeche vajah test siries main rohit ke shandaar pradarshan ko bhi mana ja rahaa tha, lekin viraat kohli ke baad team ke sabase pratibhavan ballebaaj kahe jane vaale mumbai ke is khilaadi ne buree tarah se niraash kiya
 He could not reach beyond 20 runs in any of the four matches
 rohit pehle vanade main 14, duusare main 15, tisare main 13 or chauthe main 11 ran banaakar out hue
 Every time he struggled for large runs
 tippaniyan Not getting a strong start from the opener pair put pressure on the middle
 khushkismati se viraat kohli ke balle ne barase ranon kii badaulat team india opening kii is naakaami ko 'dhankane' main safal rahi
 Virat proved to be a big difference between the two teams in the ODI series so far
 dharmashala main 85* or mohali kii 154* ran kii paariyaan bharat ke liye jeet ai
 Team India is so much dependent on Virat at the moment that the New Zealand players got shoulders high after being dismissed in their second ODI in Delhi and the Kiwi team managed to register the first win in the entire series
 viraat kohli par jarurat se adhik nirbharta team india ke liye aage kii siries main baari pad sakati he
 The Indian team will face England and Australia stronger than New Zealand in the matches of Koge, so its openers will have to make big partnerships to beat the opposition team

 newjiland ke khilaaf vanade siries se pehle rohit sharma se kaaphi bad-chadhakar ummid lagaai gai thim
 The reason behind this was also believed to be Rohit's brilliant performance in the Test series, but this Mumbai player, who is said to be the most talented batsman of the team after Virat Kohli, was badly disappointed
 chaar main se kisi match main ve 20 ran ke paar nahin pahunch paae
 Rohit was out for 14 in the first ODI, 15 in the second, 13 in the third and 11 in the fourth
 badi ransankhya ke liye har baar ve sangharsh karte dikhe
 The comments openar jodi se majboot shuruyaat nahin milane ke kaaran madhyakram par dabaav badha
 Luckily, Virat Kohli's bat was successful in 'covering up' this failure of Team India opening thanks to the runs scored

 Naveen Patnaik lived in America

 Digvijay Singh, who frequently attacked communal politics, was from Congress, and BJP vice-president Smriti Irani, daughter-in-law of TV family, was handling the front
 lekin baton hi baton main digvijay ne bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi kii tarif bhi kar di
 In the first session of the second day of Agenda Aaj Tak, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh said that he was happy that bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi is changing and trying to build his liberal image by following the path of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 unhone kaha ki ek chywala piem ban saktaa he, lekin narendra modi nahin
 Digvijay also said that if BJP wins, it should make Sushma Swaraj the PM
 aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main agsit pole main congress kii haar ke anumaan par digvijay ne kaha ki main 40 saal se raajnneeti main hum
 Have seen many ups and downs

 Smriti spoke on this, that you neither pay attention to the opinion poll nor give importance to the voice of the assembly elections
 smriti boleen ki pradeshon ke chunaav agle loksabhaa chunaav ke liye sanket de rahe hai
 Digvijay said that in most of the state assembly elections held after the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, we have wrested the state from BJP in four
 unhone seetwar bhi byora diya or phir bole ki bijepi jitna chaahe maahaul banaae, nattejey aane ke baad sab saamne aa jayega
 What is the mission of our politics 2014 Arun Jaitley said that the Congress cannot defeat Narendra Modi politically, hence, is adopting dirty tricks
 is coment par digvijay bole ki modi hamaare liye mudda nahin hai
 Will be for BJP
 unhone kaha ki modi ke naam par vipakshi party vyaktivaadee raajnneeti kar rahi he
 On this, Smriti retorted, calling the Congress a bonded party of a family
 smriti boleen ki bijepi ke mukhyamantri aam prishthbhumi se aae hai or unhone apni mehnat or kaabiliyat se raajnneeti main haisiyat banaai he
 Chaiwala can also become PM: Digvijaydigvijay said that i want to talk about the ideology and organization of the party
 unhone kaha ki agar kerala ke machuaare kaa betaa raashtrapati ban saktaa he, to chaay vaala bhi pradhanmantri ban saktaa he
 Digvijay was asked why this is not possible in the Congress, then he said that the leader is born from the ballot, not from the stomach
 digvijay bole ki dikkat aam aadmi se nahin taanashaah se he
 He said that i want Sushma Swaraj to become Prime Minister if BJP comes to power
 smriti boleen ki kaabiliyat to rahul gandhi se hajaar guna zyada digvijay singh main he
 Why does not his party bring them forward

 smriti boleen ki digvijay ye baat gujarat chunaav ke pehle bhi kehete the
 But the results have been exposed
 digvijay singh ne mahatma gandhi kaa zikr karte hue ek kissa sunaaya
 He said that the Congress fought against both communal Hindus and communal Muslims
 mujffar nagar dangon kaa zikr karte hue vah bole ki jin vidhayakon par danga karne kaa aarope he, unhen narendra modi kii agra raily main sammanit kiya gaya
 Smriti clarified that the mlas were not convicted by the court

 With this much said, he tried to surround the Shivraj Chauhan government in Madhya Pradesh
 modi kaa musalmaan prem kaisaa hedgar modi musalamaanon ko kareeb laane kii koshish karen to kya harj he
 In the context of this question, Smriti asked Digvijay that there was firing on Muslims in Gopalgarh, Rajasthan, children dying in Muzaffarnagar riots relief camp
 congress ne kya kiya
 On this, Digvijay Singh said that we set up a commission in Rajasthan and punished the culprits
 phir unhone gujarat dangon kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki main is masale ko chhedana nahin chahta, magar narendra modi ko bhi samaj aa gaya he ki kattar chhavi nahin chalegi
 Now he has changed the course of his speeches and is trying to follow the path of Atal Bihari
 main isse khush hum
 In praise of the Sangh, Digvijay singhdigvijay Singh said that if the Sangh has understood that there should be a matter of most development here, there should be a matter of universal religion, then it is a good thing for the country
 lekin rahul gandhi is tarah kii baat kyon nahin kar rahe hai
 Diggi said on this question that Rahul is already secular
 dangon ke peediton ke iesai ke sampark main hone sambandhi rahul ke bayaan par digvijay singh ne safai di ki yah bahut maanviya traasadee thi or aapako un logon kii manodasha samajni hogi
 Furthering the debate, Smriti said that the Congress sees a riot here, their suffering, but millions of people were displaced in Kokrajhar in Assam and Rahul Gandhi could not speak
 snupaget ke masale par kya bole dononsmriti irani ne kaha ki jis tepe ko relies karne vaale log hi shyor nahin hai ki tepe asli hai yaa nakli
 What should the party say on them
 is par digvijay singh bole ki khud amit shah tivi par aakar safai de chuke hai
 Then he said that the Indian Telegraph Act was clearly violated in this case
 is par smriti boleen ki agar mahila ke adhikaron kaa ulanghan hua he, to vah ab tak saamne kyon nahin ain
 Smriti then said that a commission has been formed to investigate the matter anyway
 is par digvijay singh bole ki arvind kejariwal or narendra modi badi acchhee baat karte hai, aarope lagata he to khud hi jaanch agency tay kar lete hai or khud hi jaj bhi

 The Uttar Pradesh government has been under severe criticism ever since the suspension of Durga Shakti Nagpal, who was SDM of Greater Noida
 kuch kaaryakartaaon or rajanetaaon ne aarope lagaaya tha ki masjid kii diwaar ko bahaanaa banaakar durga ko isliye pad se hataa diya gaya kyonki wo rajya main chal rahe avaidh khanan kaa virodh kar rahi thim
 Now Chief Minister of the state Akhilesh Yadav has revealed in an interview to Wall Street Journal that the posting of suspended IAS Durga Shakti Nagpal in Noida was done at the request of her husband
 unhone kaha ki ab unhen apane faisle par afsos he
 Significantly, Durga's husband is posted in Ghaziabad near Noida
 pesh hai akhilesh se baatcheet ke ansh:sawaal:aapane durga shakti nagpal ko nilambit kyon kiya?akhilesh yadav:main pehle hi aapako bataa duun ki is maamle main jaanch chal rahi he
 We have filed the charge sheet, which will be answered by Durga Nagpal
 uttar pradesh ke halaat samajhane jaruri hai
 In the last five months, there have been many incidents which could have increased the violence
 pichley hafte meerut main kuch log bhajan sunanaa chaahate the or ek samooh namaaj padhanaa chahta tha
 This triggered a debate and there was a firing
 is vaardaat main do logon kii maukey par hi maut ho gai
 In Saharanpur, two Muslims had an accident, after which a quarrel ensued
 to ye he uttar pradesh kaa maahaul
 In Nagpal's case, some Muslim leaders had been collecting donations for several months to build the mosque, but when no one raised any objections, they built a wall
 durga nagpal ek din maukey par pahunchi or aadesh de diya ki diwaar gira di jaaegi
 She started saying, 'I will not leave until the wall is dropped
 ' jab diwaar giraayi gai tab wo vahaan maujuud thi or ve is baat se inkaar nahin kar saktin
 Even some villagers have said that she was there till the wall was demolished
 iske baad ek muslim netaa ne kaha ki is mudde par baatcheet karne ke liye panchayat bulaai jaaegi
 Not only this, the Local Intelligence Unit ie LIU also reported that there is a possibility of peace in the area
 agar diwaar giraae jane ke virodh main panchayat bhi koi aadesh de detii to phir kya hota? is samay roje chal rahe hai or dharmik maahaul he
 Who would be responsible if something happens? i had to take an action to calm the case
 sawaal:lekin sthaneey khabaron main district magistrate kii report ke hawaale se kaha gaya he ki gaanvvaalon ne diwaar giraayi thi or tab nagpal vahaan par maujuud nahin thim
 Akhilesh Yadav: As i said, we are investigating the matter
 ham dm kii report samet sabhi pahaluon kii padtaal kar rahe hai
 Question: Critics say that before the riots in the state, you responded very rarely
 lekin is maamle main aapaki sarkaar ne nagpal ke nilamban main teji dikhaai
 Why was he treated differently? Akhilesh Yadav: My government has taken action in many cases
 hamane faijabad or mathura main bhi adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa or nilamban kiya he
 We take action against every officer who is irresponsible
 ek mukhyamantri hone ke naate main or kya kar saktaa hum? agar aap thik se kaam nahin karenge to isamen meri kya galati?nagpal ke cese main maine unhen mahatvapurn jagah par kaam karne kaa avasar diya
 She is a young IAS officer and her husband requested me to do her posting in Greater Noida
 ab mujhe lagata he ki maine galati kar di
 Question: The media, activists and some politicians are strongly supporting Nagpal
 aap unhen kya kahana chahenge?akhilesh yadav:kuch log hai jo meri sarkaar giraanaa chaahate hai
 Bodoland is not a big issue for them, where thousands of people are protesting
 unke liye alag telugana bhi koi mudda hi nahin he
 An SDM suspension is the biggest issue for them
 hamane nagpal ko kaam karne se kabhi nahin roka
 We gave them complete freedom to work
 lekin unase sampradayik sauhaard bigaadane ke liye kisne kaha?sawaal:media main ain khabaren kah rahi hai ki nagpal ko isliye nishane par liya gaya kyonki ve un baaluu mafiaon kaa virodh kar rahi thim, jinhen raajnneetik sharan mili hui he
 What do you want to answer on these allegations? Akhilesh Yadav: Wherever illegal sand mining is going on in Uttar Pradesh, my government is taking action
 rajya main bahut si nadiyaan hai, isliye yah samasya badi he
 To stop this, we have to continue the proceedings
 hamen to yah bhi nahin pataa ki durga avaidh khanan ke khilaaf kadam uthaa rahi thim
 His suspension has nothing to do with illegal mining
 ek mahatvapurn faisle ke tahat yah samajha jaataa he ki sarkaar ne sansad par hamale ke doshi mohammad afjal guru kii dayaa yachika ko khaarij kar dene kii raashtrapati ke paas sifarish bheji he
 Afzal has been sentenced to death
 afjal guru congress kaa damaad he kya: gadakrimana jaataa he ki grih mantralay ne varsh 2001 main sansad par hue aatankwaadi hamale ke maamle main doshi qaraar diye gayi afjal kii dayaa yachika ko khaarij karne sambandhi file raashtrapati ke paas bhej di he
 The death sentence awarded to Afzal has been upheld by the High Court and the Supreme Court
 afjal guru kii faansee par vot kii raajnneeti?yah bhi mana jaataa he ki grih mantralay ne dilli sarkaar kii us sifarish kaa hawala diya he jisamen afjal ko faansee diye jane kaa paksh liya gaya he
 This is an issue which has been pending for the last seven years and there has been considerable political controversy
 is tarah ke sanket sabase pehle din main tab mili jab grih rajya mantri mullapalli ramchandran ne rajyasabha ko ek sawaal ke likhit jawaab main bataaya ki grih mantralay ne afjal kii dayaa yachika ko nirnay ke liye raashtrapati sachivalay ke paas bhej diya he
 Ramachandran said, "the mercy petition of Mohammed Afzal Guru, who has been convicted for the death penalty, has been referred to the President's Secretariat on July 27, 2011 for decision
 ’’ mantri se bhaajapa ke prakaash javdekar ne afjal ko faansee diye jane main ho rahe vilamb se sambandhit sawaal poocha tha
 Javadekar had asked whether there was any constitutional provision to walk on the basis of order to decide on a 'mercy petition' seeking not to be sentenced to death, to which Ramachandran said, "there is no such constitutional provision 
 sabhi maamalon ke saath nishpaksh or twarit bartaav sunishchit karaane kaa prashasnic faisla hota he
 Afzal Guru was convicted in the December 2001 case of conspiracy to attack Parliament and the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence awarded to him in 2004
 use 20 aktubar 2006 ko faansee di jaani thi
 However, Afzal's wife was stopped after her mercy petition
 is bich, congress afjal guru ko jald faansee diye jane se jude sawaal par sidhaa jawaab dene se bachati najar aayi
 The party said that it would not be appropriate to react to the mercy petition submitted to the President
 party pravaktaa raashid alvi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki yah vyavastha kaa ek hissaa he
 The matter is with the President
 nyaayalay ke vichaaradhin maamalon kii hi tarah raashtrapati ko saunpe gayi muddon par bhi kuch kahana uchit nahin hota

 It may be known that Yadav had recently said in an event held in Mainpuri that the people of SP are illegally occupying the land at various places

 The corporate world is desperate because the government is not taking decisions
 kahin karpshan ke aarope daraa rahe hai to kahin raajnneetik majaburiyaan pareshaan kar rahi hai
 With the second innings of Manmohan Singh, the industry was hoping that fast steps would be taken on economic reforms, but today the condition is that our entire system is stuck in one place
 use apni raajnneetik majaburiyaan roak rahi hai, use bhrashtachar ke sawaal daraa rahe hai
 The result is that the corporate world is depressed
 udyogpati adi godarej kaa kahana he ki yah jo bhrashtachar ke khilaaf abhiyaan he, isse log ghabara gaye hai
 Dhruv Sahni of Triveni Engineering and Industries says that the CAG is not taking any decision after the report
 sabhi media se dare hue hai
 The government is scared Babu is not taking forward the ministers, the ministers are avoiding taking big decisions
 iskaa tanaav udyog jagat main dikh rahaa he
 Doing business is no longer a big profit deal
 udyogpati kiran shaw majumdaar kaa kahana he ki nirnay lene main deree ho rahi he or industry ke liye yah sabase mahatvapurn mudda he
 Many important bills have been stuck for a long time due to lack of decision
 kuch mahatvapurn bill jo abhi bhi atake hue hai nimna hai- bhoomi adhigrahan bill, guds and services tex bill, multi−brand retail main 100 fisadi epadiai, diarect tex code bill aadi
 The question also arises regarding the proposed laws for reforms in banking insurance and pension sectors
 udyogpati godarej kaa kahana he ki vikaas kaise tej ho is par dhyaan diya janaa chaiye
 New proposed legislation should be passed quickly to improve the economy
 agar ye centiment lambey samay tak bana rahaa to kya isse bijnes jagat ko nuksaan nahin hoga
 Industrialist Rahul Bajaj even says that the policy is paralysis
 yah baar−baar bolnaa thik nahin he
 India is a good story even today
 yah hamen nahin bhoolanaa chaiye, pichley 6−12 maheene se polisy paralysis he
 Nobody is happy
 tippaniyan Industrialist Dhruv Sahni is of the opinion that the market is negative
 ham apni sthiti kharaab kar rahe hai
 All issues need to be discussed
 maahaul badalanaa chaiye, vishwaas hona chaiye ki agar maal banegaa to bikega
 i will not spend money if the decision is to be taken after 6 months
 ek taraf udyog jagat ke jajbaat hai duusari taraf sarkaar ke sahyogiyon kaa dabaav he
 The Prime Minister is unable to muster the political will to move forward even on his wish
 manmohan singh kii duusari pari ke saath udyog jagat ko ummid thi ki aarthik sudhaaron par tezi se kadam uthaae jaaenge lekin aaj haalat yah hai ki hamaara puraa tantra jaise ek jagah atak gaya he
 His political compulsions are stopping him, threatening him with questions of corruption
 nateeja yah hua he ki karporate duniya maayoos he
 Industrialist Adi Godrej says that this campaign against corruption has made people nervous
 vahiin triveni ejineering or industries ke dhruv saahani kaa kahana he ki sieji report ke baad koi faisla nahin le rahaa he

 Industrialist Kiran Shaw Mazumdar says decision making is delayed and is the most important issue for the industry
 faisla na le paane kii vajah se kai ahm bill lambey samay se atake pade hai
 Some of the important bills which are still stuck are the following: Land Acquisition Bill, Goods and Services Tax Bill, 100% FDI in multi-brand retail, Direct Tax Code Bill etc
 sawaal bankig insurance or pansion sectoron main sudhaar ko lekar prastaavit kanoonon ko lekar bhi uth rahaa he
 Industrialist Godrej says that attention should be given to how fast the development is
 arthvyavastha main sudhaar ke liye nae prastaavit kanoon ko jaldi paas karaayaa jaae
 If this concentration remains for a long time, will it not harm the business world
 udyogpati rahul bajaj kaa to yahaan tak kahana he ki polisy paralysis he
 It is not right to say it again and again
 india ek acchhee story aaj bhi he
 Let us not forget, for the last 6–12 months, the policy is paralysis

 To this, Sonu Nigam said that 'there is no need to fight on every issue
 ' ek kaarykram ke dauraan sonu is bare main baat kar rahe the ki in dinon kyon kai gaanon ke rimix ban rahe hai
 He was jokingly said, "sometimes i feel that if i was a Pakistani, it would have been better, at least i would have got an offer of work from India
 "sonu ne yah bhi kaha tha, "agar aap kehete hai ki 'anu malik ne aaj subah mujhase mulaakaat kii' to yah thik he
 But without accusing you of any evidence, accept it also
 agar vah (anu malik) is par kuch bolnaa chaahate, to bahut kuch bol sakate the
 But they did not do so
 "sona mahapatra kaa sonu par hamalaa, malik kaa kiya tha saportunhone kaha tha, "agar main kahuun ki aapane mere saath budtamiji kii to aap kahenge kii saboot dikhaao? lekin saboot to nahin he naa
 Even then, people are giving respect to the accusers who are maligning Anu Malik
 or, aap unako bain kaise kar sakate hai? kisi kii roji roti ko kaise chin sakate hai aap? unki family ko kyon tarchar karenge aap?"kya he maamla?anu malik par gayika sona mahapatra ne yon durvyavhaar kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 After Sonu Nigam defended Anu Malik, Sona Mahapatra lodged her protest against Sonu
 unhone kaha ki sonu kii is tarah kii baton ko sunakar unhen dhakka laga

 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said on Monday that there is a need to crush the militancy issued by Naxalites in various states of the country

 Uddhav said, the same law should be applied in the context of Naxalites, which is applicable to Indian Mujahideen, lashkar-e-taiba, Al Qaeda or other anti-national forces
 centre evam rajya sarkaron ko naksaliyon se nipatane ke liye harsambhav kade kadam uthaane chahie
 Uddhav said that instead of doing politics on Naxalite attack, all parties should unite and take action against Naxalism, due to which hundreds of innocent people have died in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh
 tippaniyan Uddhav said that recently the Naxalites did not allow the Gram Panchayat elections in Chandrapur
 vahaan naksaliyon ne anya logon ko chetavanee dene ke liye ek sarpanch kaa saream sir kalam kar diya
 Uddhav said, when the Pakistani army beheaded our soldiers, the whole country was angry, but when the Naxalites did the same act, we ignored it
 hamen is maansikta ko badalane kii aavashyaktaa he
 In an editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana', Uddhav on Saturday condemned the attack on a convoy of Congress leaders and workers in Chhattisgarh's Bastar region, saying that those responsible for the incident should be treated in the same manner as terrorist Ajmal Aamir was with Kasab and Afzal Guru

 Encounter between security forces and militants continues in Jammu and Kashmir's Pampore since Monday morning
 puri raat donon pakshon ke bich golibari hui
 It is being told that the army is preparing to demolish the EDI building
 isi imaarat main kal se aatanki chhipe hue hai
 Let me tell you that on Monday, the sounds of firing shots were heard from the building of Entrepreneur Development Institute in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir
 jiske baad building ko khaali karvaa liya gaya
 An army soldier was injured in this firing
 pampor main sthit is imaarat ke andar do yaa teen aatanki chhipe hone kii khabar he
 As soon as the news of the attack was received, the army surrounded the building from all sides and firing started from both sides

 loksabhaa chunaav menuttar pradesh ke amethi main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke haar gaye hai
 According to the Election Commission website, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has got 362248 and BJP candidates 410326 votes
 yani donon ke bich 48 hajaar ke voton kaa antar he
 However, before the results were announced, Rahul accepted the defeat by holding a press conference
 lekin amethi main rahul gandhi kii haar koi saadhaaran ghatana nahin he
 This is the second incident in the history of Congress when such a big leader belonging to the Gandhi family has lost in a traditional seat like Amethi
 amethi isliye bhi mahatvapurn he kyonki is seat par purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ko unke hi parivaar ko menka gandhi bhi nahin haraa pai thim
 On the other hand, when Indira Gandhi lost the seat next to Amethi, there was an anti-incumbency against Emergency and Indira became very weak while in power
 lekin is baar rahul gandhi kisi satta virdohi lahar kaa saamana nahin kar rahe the or unke prachaar main priyanka gandhi bhi kud gai thim
 But if there was any Modi wave behind bjp's victory in Amethi, it would be a bit wrong because Smriti Irani was more active than Rahul Gandhi in Amethi even after losing in 2014 elections
 smriti irani centre main mantri hote hue bhi amethi kaa daura karti raheen
 Smriti Irani's special thing was that in these years she had memorized the names of the street neighborhoods and workers in Amethi
 iske saathi irani aam janata se judati chali gai
 The image of Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi had become that of a political tourist who used to go to the polls but on normal days he would come for two days and shook hands from inside the car
 amethi main haar kaa ek bada kaaran rahul gandhi kaa vynad se chunaav ladanaa bhi rahaa he
 However, Rahul Gandhi has broken all the records of victory here
 bijepi ne amethi main yah prachaar jamkar kiya ki haar kii dar se rahul gandhi vynad chale gaye
 On the one hand, it is also worth noting that the SP-BSP alliance in Amethi and Rae Bareli did not field candidates
 agar aisa hota to yahaan congress ke liye or mushkil ho jaati
 At present, according to the seats which the Congress is getting all over the country, it can get 11 seats

 BS Yeddyurappa has been in power in Karnataka and once again the BJP government is formed
 haalanki bijepi ko bahumat se 8 siten kam hai
 On the other hand JDS and Congress have joined hands after the election results
 donon party milakar chunaav ladati to aaj unhen satta ke liye sangharsh karnaa nahin padataa he
 Despite this, if the congress-jds contest the Lok Sabha elections together, then only half a dozen seats can be won in the BJP account in Karnataka
 congress-jediesdonon dal milakar vidhansabha ke ran main utarate to kahani kuch or hoti
 The BJP could hold only 68 seats
 vahiin in donon ke gathbandhan ko kareeb 156 siten hasil ho sakati thim
 If all goes well, then this alliance of Congress and JDS will continue in the Lok Sabha elections also in 2019, which will be a big challenge for BJP to save their fort in Karnataka
 kuch jaankaron ke mutabik, jedies or congress gathbandhan ko mili pratishat ke aadhaar par agar loksabhaa kshetron ke hisaab se aankalan karen to bijepi ko karnataka main 28 main se keval 6 siton se hi santosh karnaa hoga
 Whereas in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it has managed to win 17 seats in Karnataka
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019main karnataka ke bagalkot, haveri, dharwar, udupi-chikmagalore, dakshin kannada or dakshin bagalkot main bijepi ko jeet mil sakati he
 According to this, the BJP cannot manage to win any seats in hyderabad-karnataka and South Karnataka
 jabaki vartmaan mat pratishat ke aadhaar par congress-jedies gathbandhan ke khate main 22 siten ja sakati hai
 In fact, the situation in Karnataka is more or less like that of Uttar Pradesh where the Samajwadi Party and BSP underestimated the bjp's strength and contested separately
 usee prakaar karnataka main congress or jedies ne narendra modi or amit shah ke netritv ko nazarandaaj kar alag-alag chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya or iskaa nateeja ye hua ki bijepi sabase badi party banakar ubhari
 But now both the parties are standing with each other and are trying their best to stop the BJP in power

 It started on 23 January last year
 ab ye sabhi filein saarvajanik taur par uplabdh hai
 After meeting Netaji's family in 2015, PM Modi had also announced that he would also demand the Russian government to make the files related to Netaji public
 antarrashtriya shram sanstha (ielo) ne haal hi main anumaan jataayaa he ki bharat main 2018 main berozegaron kii sankhya badhkar 1
 86 crore mark
 anumaan ke mutabik 2019 main yah aankada badhkar 1
 89 crores while the number of unemployed in the country 1 in 2017
 83 karod aanki gai thi
 Apart from these figures, in the 2014 general elections, Narendra Modi had promised that after becoming the Prime Minister, he would create 1 crore new jobs every year during his tenure so that the unemployment figures in the country could be corrected
 ab modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal ko 4 saal biit chuke hai or apane antim saal main pravesh kar rahi sarkaar ko 2019 main ek baar phir janata ke saamne janaa hoga
 The question arises that during the last four years, the Modi government has been able to create 4 crore new jobs at the rate of 1 crore jobs per year so far or will it take time to fulfill this promise? According to the data released by the Union Ministry of Labor According Modi government during 2015 1
 55 lakh naukariyaan paidaa kin to 2016 ke dauraan 2
 31 lakh new jobs were created
 vahiin 2014 main congress se satta kii bagdor sanbhaalane ke baad modi sarkaar ne 4
 Created 93 lakh jobs
 haalanki 2014 ke aankadon main gananaa un maheenon kii bhi shaamil he jab desh main congress kii sarkaar thi
 Read this: How much Modi has met on these parameters of economy from GDP to inflation
 Now one thing is clear from these figures that before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP promised 1 crore jobs
 lekin philhal chaar saal bitne ke baad vah prati varsh lakh- do lakh-teen lakh naukariyaan de paa rahi he
 However, before this, Congress had also included the promise of 1 crore jobs in its manifesto before the elections and BJP also criticized the Manmohan government on the same issue that it could not create new jobs in the country during his tenure
 kya sambhav hai 1 karod naukari?ab berogari par ielo ke aankadon ko dekhen bharat main 2018 main 1
 86 crore unemployed are being counted
 2019 main yah sankhya lagbhag 3 lakh or badhakar 1
 89 crore will be unemployed
 is aankade se yadi modi sarkaar ke vaade ke aankade ko hataa den to swaabhaavik he ki desh main berogari ke str main acha sudhaar dikhaai dene lagegaa
 But in the four years of the promises made in 2014, when the crore figure was far away, the current Modi government also realized that such a big goal of job creation cannot be met under the basic definition of employment
 iske chalate beete ek saal ke dauraan khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pakora rojgaar kaa zikr kiya jise baad main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah sansad tak le gaye or daleel di ki desh main modi sarkaar ke dauraan swarozgaar bhi rojgaar srijan mana janaa chahie
 Significantly, earlier in this dispute, Arvind Subramanian, the chief economic advisor in the Modi government, has also argued that the figures of employment and unemployment being collected in the country so far do not present the right picture
 yah daleel isliye di gai thi kyonki 2017 main jari hue rojgaar ke aankadon main modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan ola or ubar cab sarvice dwaara 8 lakh driver ko die gaye rojgaar ko nahin joda gaya tha
 Read this: Modi could not reduce the price of petrol and diesel in 4 years, know- Reasons, however, whether these figures are included in the estimation or not, at present, it is difficult for the Modi government to create 1 crore jobs
 And that's why the promise of one crore jobs for the Congress government was proved before that
