 He said that Rakesh Singh was elected during my tenure and became the Block President

 sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ke jaj esaje sharma ne sabooton ke abhaav main sabhi 22 aropiyon ko bari kar diya tha
 Now about a week later, some important issues have come up in the decision of the case, the most important of which is the investigation agency CID and CBI
 jaj esaje sharma ne takreeban 350 pannon main apane faisle ke para 210 main likhaa he ki sibiai maamle main sach kii tah tak jane ke bajaay pehle se likhi script ke mutabik sabooton ko gadhane main lagi thi
 The judge has even written that in view of the evidence, witnesses and material placed before me during the trial, i have no hesitation in saying that the CBI, an important investigative agency, worked on a story made for political purposes in the past
 Will happen
 jaahir he kisi bhi jaanch agency ke liye adaalat kii is tarah kii tippanee uski chhavi ke liye thik nahin he
 Judge SJ Sharma further wrote that most of the witnesses turned hostile at the time of their deposition in the court
 par meraa maananaa he ki ve mukare nahin balki adaalat ke saamne unhone nidar hokar jo sach tha vah bataaya
 It is clear that the CBI continued to work to achieve the objective set according to the script in the entire investigation
 taaki kisi bhi tarah raajnneetik netaaon ko fansaaya jaae
 For this, the CBI recorded false statements, fabricated evidence which could not stand the court's judicial inquiry
 gavaahon ne adaalat main bina kisi bhay ke bayaan die
 It is clear from this that in order to prove its story, the CBI deliberately took the statements of the witnesses wrong
 jaj ne apni tippanee main aaropee kramank 16 kaa zikr kiya he
 Accused No
 16 means BJP President Amit Shah
 amit shah maamle main pehle hi aarope mukt ho chuke hai
 The judge has written that while ordering the discharge before me, the judge wrote about the accused number 16 that in view of everything, it seems that the entire investigation was done for political purpose
 jaj esaje sharma kaa ishaara saaf he ki amit shah ko ek sajeesh ke tahat maamle main fansaane kii koshish hui thi
 The judge has further written that the negligent investigation and false evidence of the CBI shows that the earlier investigation was hastily carried forward and implicated innocent policemen who were not aware of any conspiracy
 faisla khatm karne ke baad jaj ne likhaa he ki ho saktaa he is faisle se samaaj or peedit parivaar main gussa or jhunjhalaahat paidaa ho
 But without strong evidence, the decision is not given only in the emotions
 abhiyojan paksh kii jimmedaari hoti he ki cese ko sabit kare, wo bhi pukhta sabooton ke aadhaar par
 The murder of Sohrabuddin Sheikh remains unsolved
 uski patni kausarabi kii kahani bhi sabooton ke abhaav main bina kisi anjaam tak pahunche adhuri hi rah gai
 According to the judge, the talk of Sohrabuddin going from Indore to Hyderabad and then to Sangli by bus, then kidnapping and then burning him, could not be proved
 isliye mere paas aropiyon ko bari karne ke alaava koi chaara nahin he
 This is the final decision of Judge SJ Sharma as he is retiring this month

 India lost 0–2 in the third Test of the 6-test series played against the West Indies in Ahmedabad, but for the first time, the representation of so many Sikh cricketers in a single match made that Test memorable

 Milkha Singh died two days ago on 10 November 2017
 -bharat ke test itihaas main kai aise sikh cricketer aae, jinhone apane pradarshan se desh kaa naam roshan kiya

 Asked about the Al Qaeda threat to launch operations in India, Raha said, "there is a danger from such agencies, but the country is ready to deal with them
" rahaa varsh 1965 main pakistan ke saath hue yuddh main vayusena kii bhoomika par yojit sammelan se alag samvaadadaataaon se baat kar rahe the
 US media and intelligence agencies said on Thursday that al Qaeda has set up a new branch to wage jihad in India, expand its activities and implement sharia in the Indian subcontinent
 afghanistan or pakistan main al kaayda sakriy he, lekin gut ke netaa ayman al jawahiri ne kaha ki 'kaaydat al jihad' uski ladaai ko bharat, myamar or bangladesh tak le jayega
 Security agencies believe the video may be an Al Qaeda attempt to recruit fresh recruits in the subcontinent, as they feel its influence is diminishing due to ISIS

 Something similar is going to happen in Britain where two five-year-old greyhound dog-bitches are going to get married

 The two will accept each other in a glittering ceremony at Woodman's cattle ranch

 The wedding ceremony in Wood Green will be conducted by Pastor Gayle Lees, who will read the Nikahnama exclusively
 vivaah samaaroh ke baad duulhaa dulhan apane baade main lautenge or ek vishaal jigar kek kaa lutf uthaaenge
 On this occasion, Joey will wear a wedding gown specially designed by Donna Fernie, who prepares dogs
 gauratlab he ki pashushaala ke karmchaariyon ne peet or joe ko aawaara ghoomte paaya tha or ve unhen june main wood green main le aae
 Since then, the two have never been apart from each other for a single moment
 is par karmchaariyon ne sochaa ki kyon na unke pyaar par vaidhata kii mohar lagane ke liye unki shaadi kara di jaae
 Nicola Taylor of the cattle ranch said, "joey and Pete loved each other so much that we decided to get them married
 hamen ummid he ki isse unhen nayaa ghar dhundne main bhi madad milegi
 'he said,' Joey and Pete are very cute dogs who can live happy families with children for the next ten years
 ve billiyon ke saath nahin rah sakate or unhen insaanon ke saath rahanaa pasand he isliye ve achche paaltu jaanavar sabit ho sakate hai
 ' sansad kaa bajet satr khatm ho gaya
 This was the first session of this government and the biggest feature of this session was that in the last 10 years, during the Question Hour, the functioning went on this time in the best manner
 loksabhaa main 24 fisadi sawaal sarkaar se puche gaye, jo varsh 2004 ke baad sabase adhik he
 This time, the Lok Sabha was the least disturbed, but this session will also be remembered because the insurance bill could not be passed despite all the efforts of the government
 haalanki, jajon kii niyukti se sambandhit bill ko sarkaar paas karaane main safal rahi
 The government had to accept an amendment of the opposition and now it will become law after passing the assembly of 15 states
 magar beemaa bill ke latakane kaa malaal sarkaar main sabko he
 The bill provides for increasing the limit of foreign investment in the insurance sector from 26 per cent to 49 per cent
 sarkaar chaahati thi ki beemaa bill 15 agast se pehle paas ho jaae taaki pradhanmantri iskaa zikr laal kile se apane bhaashan main kar saken or jab sitambar main vah america ke daure par jaaen to videshi nivesh laane ke liye unke paas kuch aisa ho jisase vah videshi companiyon ko lubhaa saken
 But the solidarity of the opposition forced the government to kneel and now this bill has been sent to the committee of Rajya Sabha
 ab yah bill sansad ke sheetakaalaan satr main hi paas ho paaegaa
 In fact, the Congress is taking revenge on the Modi government in the same way as the BJP did with the UPA
 saath hi congress kii koshish he ki vaicharik maamalon main vipakshi partiyon ke saath ek bada gathjod banaae
 In this session, the Congress turned around and said that the speaker is not giving full opportunity to the opposition
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki isi virodh ko jataane ke liye rahul gandhi sampradayik hinsa ke khilaaf bahes kii maang ke dauraan vail main bhi koode
 In this session, discussion had also started that the session should be shortened because the government had no business
 haalanki, sarkaar yah jarur kahegi ki monsoon, mahangaai, mahilaon or bacchon ke khilaaf hinsa ke saath saath sampradayik hinsa jaise muddon par charchaa hui
 The impact of the government's majority was also seen in the House
 loksabhaa main jahaan sarkaar ko bahumat he, adhik kaamkaaj hua, jabaki rajyasabha main keval 15 fisadi sawaalon ke jabaab prashnkaal main die ja sake
 This session will also be remembered because the Congress continued to press for the recognition of the main opposition party and the government kept avoiding the speaker, which the Congress showed in the Rajya Sabha and also attacked the speaker
 rahul gandhi ne baqayda media se is bare main shikaayat kii or ant main sarkaar ne loksabhaa main upaadhyaksh kaa pad vipaksh yaa apane kisi sahyogi ko dene ke bajaae eidiemke ko diya or thambi durai upaadhyaksh bane
 The reason is simple, this increased the support of 11 mps in the Rajya Sabha who are from AIDMK in favor of the government
 yani rajyasabha main bahumat kii tis sarkaar ko salti rahi or usase nikalne ke liye sarkaar ranneeti banaati rahi

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi addressed the rally in Kanker, Chhattisgarh
 unhone piem modi (PM Modi) par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 In this election rally organized in view of Chhattisgarh assembly elections, Congress President Rahul Gandhi attacked the Modi government fiercely
 yahaan unhone rafel( Rafale Deal) main kathith ghotaale or notebandi (demonetisation) ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Rahul Gandhi said that the Rafale deal led to the scam of thirty thousand crores of people
 unhone kaha ki hamaari(upie) sarkaar ne 136 rafel jahaaj kharidne kaa sauda kiya tha
 It was decided that the cost of one ship would be 526 crores and the aircraft would be built by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)
 magar satta main aane par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne swayan saude ke rate badal die
 Bought 526 crore aircraft for 1600 crores
 rahul gandhi ne sabha main maujuud janata se sawaal karte hue kaha kiap poochhoge ki bhaiya
 
 526 karod kaa jahaaj 1600 karod main kyon kharida ? isliye kyonki echeel se kontract chhinakar anil ambani ko dilaa diya
 Anil Ambani never built an airplane in his entire life, but the company HAL, which had been building the ship for 70 years, snatched the contract and gave it to Ambani
 rahul ne kaha kiapako pataa bhi nahin laga ki aapkaa 30 hajaar karod rupee ghotaale kii bhent chadh gaya
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has banned demonetisation by talking about black money
 aapse poochna chahta hum ki aap log line main lage the
 Every poor person, farmer, laborer and children of India were standing in front of the bank
 magar aapane kya kisi kaledhan vaale ko line main lagate hue dekha
 Rahul Gandhi questioned the people present in the meeting and said that you will ask that brother
 
 Why buy a ship of 526 crores for 1600 crores? So because Anil Ambani was taken away by taking away the contract from HAL
 anil ambani ne apni puri jindagi main kabhi hawaii jahaaj nahin banaaya, magar sarkari company echeel jo 70 saal se jahaaj bana rahi thi , usase kontract chhinakar ambani ko de diya
 Rahul said that you did not even know that your 30 thousand crore rupees got scam
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki kaledhan kii baat kahkar pradhanmantri narendra modi ne notebandi kar di
 i want to ask that you guys were in line

 After this, he said that there is no question of seat, the question is of relationship
 isamen ham log kaaphi majboot rahenge
 Although he did not speak on how many seats the RLD will contest
 akhilesh se mulaakaat ke baad baahar nikle jayant choudhary ne kaha ki sapa adhyaksh ke saath unki baatcheet acchhee rahi, hamen isaki safalataa milegi
 We have taken the first phase of the conversation forward
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ke khilaaf or modi sarkaar ke kisaan virdohi niti ke khilaaf gathbandhan puure desh main khadaa hoga
 He said that there is no question of seat, the question is about the relationship
 kairana main hamaara talmail bahut safal rahaa he
 He said that there is no fight among the seats but we fight to fight together
 mana ja rahaa tha ki donon netaaon kii bich aaj hone vaali is baithak main areldi ko di jane vaali siton lekar tasviir saaf ho jaaegi, lekin jayant choudhary ne siton ko lekar koi baat nahin kahi
 Although the SP-BSP alliance has left 2 seats for the RLD, party president Chaudhary Ajit Singh does not agree on this
 sutron ke mutabik areldi sammanjanak taur par ab gathbandhan main 4 siten chaahati he, jisamen mujffarnagar , bagpat or mathura
 Apart from these three seats, one seat can be in Kairana and Amroha
 haalanki gathbandhan ne 2 siten areldi ke liye chhod rakhi hai, iske alaava akhilesh yadav apane cote se unhen ek or seat ofer kar sakate hai
 RLD is not ready for 2 seats but whether it will agree on 3 seats cannot be said right now
 bataa den ki shanivaar ko basapa adhyaksh mayawati or sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav ne saajha press conference karke gathbandhan kaa elaan kiya tha
 During this time, the two leaders did not say anything about RLD
 haalanki, sapa-basapa ne soobe kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se 38-38 siton par chunaav ladegi
 While 2 seats are left for the allies
 iske alaava amethi or raibareli seat par congress ke khilaaf gathbandhan koi ummidavaar nahin utaarne kii baat kahi he
 During the press conference, Akhilesh Yadav said in response to a question that the seats of RLD will be told separately
 haalanki usee ke kuch der baad sapa mahasachiv ram gopal yadav ne areldi ko do siten dene kii baat kahi thi
 He said that the two seats left are for the RLD only
 vahiin, areldi ne sapa-basapa ke saamne chah siton kii maangi rakhi he
 These include Baghpat, Mathura, Kairana, Hathras, Muzaffarnagar and Amroha seats
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan areldi ko bagpat or mujffarnagar siten dena chahta he
 In this, Chaudhary Ajit Singh from Muzaffarnagar and his son Jayant Chaudhary from Baghpat seat can contest
 sapa apane cote se areldi ko do siten de sakati he, lekin wo sidhe taur par nahin hongi
 Those seats will be where RLD candidates will have to contest on the election symbol of SP
 sutron kii maane to iske liye areldi ko pehle hi is formule ko bataa diya gaya he
 It was informed in the earlier meeting of Akhilesh Yadav and Jayant that two seats RLD fought on their election symbol and two seats under Kairana model
 dilachasp baat ye he ki areldi apane siyaasi safar main sabase sankat ke daur se guzar rahi he
 Currently, it has a party MLA who has joined the BJP in the Rajya Sabha elections
 iske alaava 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ajit choudhary or jayant choudhary bhi jeet nahin sake the
 Let me tell you that in the Kairana by-election, with the support of SP BSP, the RLD candidate won the party account

 Digvijay Singh told reporters after the election committee meeting of Uttar Pradesh Congress, 'advani compared the incident of Ramlila Maidan to Jallianwala Bagh incident
 iske liye shame aani chaiye
 He is comparing Ramdev's supporters with those martyrs who shot the British on his chest
 adwani ne swami vivekanand kii tulana ramdev se karke unka apmaan kiya he
 Describing Ramdev once again as a 'thug', he alleged that 'ramdev first compromised with the government and his colleague Balkrishna also gave written consent

 After all, where did this figure come from? singh ne kaha ki unhen aashcharya he ki ramdev ko uttar pradesh main bhrashtachar najar nahin aa rahaa he

 aisa lagata he donon bhrashtachar ke maamle main ek sikke ke do pahalu ho gaye hai
 Digvijay accused Ramdev's associate Balakrishna as a merchant of Nepal, "balakrishna has committed a crime and escaped to India and got a fake passport here

 But there was more gimmick, drama and hunger strike
 police ne unase kaha tha ki vah maidan yoga shivi ke liye diya he anshan ke liye nahin
 The Congress had nothing to do with this matter
 ’ramdev samarthakon par raat main karrwai ko sahi tehraate hue congress mahasachiv ne kaha, ‘chandani chowk jaise ghani aabaadi vaale ilaake main agar din main karrwai hoti to badi mushkil paidaa ho jaati

 The four bigha field of Brij Bhushan, a farmer of Modinagar, is lying vacant
 ganne kii kataai ke baad vah ab tak nai fasal kii buvaai nahin kar paae hai
 Raising money for seeds and fertilizers is getting heavier due to demonetisation
 brijabhooshan kehete hai, 'khet buaai ke liye taiyaar he, lekin bank se apana paisa nahin nikaal paa rahaa hum
 Getting loans from district cooperative banks is getting difficult
 ' This is also the crisis of Jitendra Singh and Nepal Singh, some distance away from the fields of Brij Bhushan

 ' brijabhooshan ke kheton se kuch dur jitendra singh or nepal singh kaa sankat bhi yahi he
 Even after several days of efforts, they could not raise money for Rabi sowing
 unki kareeb 45 bigha zamin khaali padi he
 It is said that if you do not raise cash in two weeks, the land will be empty
 enditivi kii team jab modinagar ke elahabaad bank kii shakha pahunchi to pataa chalaa ki shuukravaar ko us vakt tak cash aayaa hi nahin tha

 The comments sarkaar ne kah diya ki kisaan puraane noton se beej kharid sakate hai, lekin jinka paisa bank main jamaa he, wo kya karen
 Meanwhile, the district cooperative banks say that until the interest paid on the loan given during the kharif crop is not paid, they will not give the new loan

 jab brahma var dene ko taiyaar hue to devon ne kaha ki rakshas pehle se hi hai, var paane ke baad to or bhi unmatta ho jaaenge
 Then Brahma remembered Saraswati
 saraswati rakshas kii jeebh par savaar huin

 Terming the Emergency as the darkest chapter in India's democratic history, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu insisted on including it in the school curriculum as a chapter
 kendriya soochna or prasaaran mantri ne kaha, apatkaal ne ek peedi ke man main aitihaasik chhap chodi he jiske bare main jaanane ko lekar aaj bhi utsukata hoti he
 This is hardly remembered by today's young generations and some of them can read stories of wounds and torture of that period
 haalanki chaar dashak biit gaye, lekinapatkalko log nahin bhuule or ise naa hi bhulaayaa janaa chahie or na hi ise maaf kiya janaa chahie
 He said, i think a chapter on emergency should be included in school courses so that today's young generation can know about it
 25 june ko apatkaal ko 42 saal bhi puure hue the to is avasar parapiem ne 'man kii baat' kaarykramame us daur ko yaad karte hue congress par bina naam liye nishaanaa saadhaa
 Modi referred to the poem of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee which he wrote in jail after completion of one year of Emergency to show the magnitude of Emergency
 piem modi ne apatkaal ko yaad karte hue kaha ki in dinon man kii baat main lagaataar janata kii ore se suzav aate rahete hai
 Prakash Tripathi, while recalling the Emergency, wrote to me that 25 June is remembered as a dark period in the history of democracy
 modi ne kaha ki loktantr ek vyavastha hi nahin balki sanskaar bhi he
 Modi said that in 1975, 25 June was such a black night that no Indian can forget
 tab desh ko jail main badal diya gaya tha or virdohi swar ko dabaa diya gaya tha
 The judicial system too could not survive the horrific form of emergency
 akhabaaron ko to bekaar kar diya gaya tha
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail at that time, on completion of one year he wrote a poem

 bahujan samaaj party (basapa) supremon mayawati ne elaan kar diya ki madhya pradesh or rajasthan main unki party apane dam par chunaav ladegi
 This decision was not taken unannounced but is part of a well thought-out strategy under which anti-bjp parties had deemed it appropriate to allow the 2019 election to be held against Modi versus others
 isaki patakatha bangaloru main isi saal may maheene kii 23 taarikh ko ech
 D
 kumaraswami ke shapath grahan samaaroh se pehle likhi gai thi
 According to information received from Janata Dal Secular (JDS), Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Samajwadi Party, Mayawati's decision to form an alliance with Ajit Jogi's party instead of Congress in Chhattisgarh and then in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh on its own or in The decision to contest elections with smaller parties in the states is part of a well thought out strategy of anti-bjp parties
 darasal, bhaajapa virdohi dal yah jaanate hai ki unke paas pradhanmantri pad kaa aisa cheharaa nahin he jo narendra modi ke vikalp ke rup main pesh kiya ja sake
 Modi is the biggest strength of the BJP, so the BJP is also wanting that the 2019 election should be Modi versus others
 philhal kii siyaasi ganit main ekajute vipaksh bhaajapa ke liye sabase mufeed he
 In contrast, the most difficult challenge for the BJP may prove to be scattered opposition as local parties in many states are in a much stronger position than the BJP
 masalan pashchim bengal, andhra pradesh, telugana, kerala, tamilnadu, odisha
 These states have a total of 164 Lok Sabha seats
 bhaajapa virdohi dalon kii pehali koshish he ki in rajyon main sthaneey dalon ke haathon bhaajapa ko haar kaa saamana karnaa pade
 Apart from these states, there is an alliance between the major local parties in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, where there are a total of 134 seats in the Lok Sabha, this is a major part of the strategy of the anti-bjp parties
 jaise uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party gathbandhan main chunaav laden or congress yahaan aghoshit rup se (bina gathbandhan kaa hissaa hue) tactical elanis ke saath chunaav lade
 The Congress contested elections with the major parties of Bihar and Jharkhand, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha to make it harder for the BJP to win more and more seats
 is tarah kul 298 se 300 siton par bhaajapa ko kathin chunauti mili
 Congress sources say that during the talks between the anti-bjp parties, the issue also came up that local parties in many states were feeling the danger of their core vote being shifted to Congress
 jaise uttar pradesh
 Since the Dalit vote is likely to go to the Congress along with Mayawati, the bsp's concern was genuine
 in ashankaon ko dur karne ke liye hi tactical elanis kaa faisla liya gaya
 Since Mayawati does not want to lose the vote of Dalits in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 isliye in rajyon main congress ke saath gathbandhan nahin hona badi ghatana nahin balki sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat uthne vaala kadam he
 Randeep Singh Surjewala, the head of Congress's media department, says that 'mayawati has not spoken against Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, she has only praised these two leaders
 ' samaajawaadee party ke ek mahasachiv kaa kahana he ki, 'mayawati ne akhilesh yadav ke khilaaf bhi kuch nahin bolaa he
 Those who are happy to think that there will be no Grand Alliance for Modi in 2019 are in mogulate
 bhaajapa ko 2004 yaad karnaa chahie

 unka puraa toornament ballebaaji ke hisaab se acha nahin rahaa
 Now here was hoping that he would be able to do something amazing, he played the shot towards mid on and ran for two runs
 lekin, vah ek hi ran puraa kar paae or ran out ho gaye
 Indian fans remember Mahendra Singh Dhoni! This time many Indian fans had the hope of New Zealand to win the World Cup
 har koi tivi screen ke saamne baitha tha, lekin jab martin gaptil ran out hue to bhartiya phens kaa dil hi tut gaya
 People wrote on Twitter, when Guptill broke the heart of Indian fans by running out Dhoni, now it has happened to them

 ’ While the Prime Minister attends Dussehra in Delhi's Ramlila every year, this is the first time that the Prime Minister will see Ravana Badh at Aishbag Ramlila in Lucknow, one of the most ancient Ramlila in the country
 bhale hi isapar siyasat ho ki chunavi saal main piem modi lakhanu kii ramlila main shirkat kar rahe hai lekin doosraa sach ye bhi he ki pichley 70 saalon se lakhanu kii eshbagh ramlila samiti harabaar pradhanmantri ko nyotaa bhejti he, lekin pehali baar kisi pradhanmantri ne us ramlila kaa aamantran sweekaar kiya he jise khud goswami tulsidas ne apane jeevankaal me shuru kiya tha or ye tab se ajtak ye ramlila anwarat jari he
 ? p It is said about Aishbagh that the first Ramlilakhud Goswami Tulsidas saw here
 ganga-jamuni tahjeeb kii pratik, eshbagh kii ramlila ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki khud tulsidas ne isaki shuruyaat kii thi lakin eshbagh kii ramlila ko asal pahchaan di avadh ke nabab asafauddaula ne jisane lakhanu ke eshbagh ilaake main ramlila ke liye saade chah acre jameen di thi
 This Nabaw asaf-ud-daula is considered to be the father of this ganga-jamuni Tehzeeb as it is said that the Nawab not only gave land for Ramlila but also himself as a character in this Ramlila
 yahi asafauddaula hai jinhone lakhanu main ek saath baraabar-baraabar idgah or ramlila ko 6
 5 acres of land were given together which stand as a symbol of ganga-jamuni Tehzeeb
 500 saal pehle shuru hui thi ramlilise ramlila ke bare main mana jaataa he ki kareeb paanch sau saal pehle sabase pehle ramlila kii shuruyaat yaheen se hui thi jab goswami tulsidas ne ek saath chitrakoot, varanasi or lakhanu main isaki neenv rakhi
 It is said that earlier it was not a Ramlila but a staging of the Ram Katha in which the saints and saints of Ayodhya came to this place to play the drama of Ram Katha
 mana jaataa he ki choumasa main jab ayodhya se sadhu-sant nikalate the to chaar maheenon ke liye isi eshbagh main unka deraa dalata tha or dashahara ke vakt is maidan main wo log ramakatha or ramakatha kaa paatr abhinay bhi karte the
 During the time of the Nawabs of Awadh, there used to be a plain Ramlila, where the characters used to act in the field and people would sit on high
 tulsidas se lekar gadar ke vakt yani 1857 tak yahaan dashahara main saadhuon kaa deraa lagata tha or maidani ramlila kaa manchan hota tha jahaan sirf ramanaam kii gaatha or ramcharita maanas kaa abhinay hua karata tha
 Ramlila remained closed for some years during Ramlilagadar i
e
 from 1857 to 1859, but for the first time in 1860, Aishbagh Ramlila Committee was formed, since then till today, even after about one hundred and a half years, Ramlila's staged Muslims are running here
 pehle is ramlila maidan ke bichombich bane talabanuma maidan main ramlila hoti thi or chaaron ore oonchai par baithe log ise dekhte the
 Ramlila used to be in the middle and people were all around but since the last few decades Ramlila started happening on the stage, then its form changed
 pehle log maidani ramlila dekhte the lekin vakt ke saath yahaan kii ramlila bhi badalati gai, ab is ramlila main takanic kaa puraa prayog hota he, bade elidi screen,lager lits or bade kalakaar isramlila ke manchaki shobhaa badhaate hai
 The land was named as Ramlila
 Historians say that asaf-ud-daula had a great interest in watching and playing Ramlila
 wo har saal das dinon tak iske manchan kaa anand letaa tha or iskaa paatr bhi banataa tha, chunki saadhuon kaa jamaavada har vakt hota tha
 Therefore, he named the land here as Ramlila
 bataate hai jab is nawab main isaki vasiyat likhi to idgah or ramlila maidan ko ekasaath vasiyat kiya
 It is said that Goswami Tulsidas himself has mentioned four Ramlilaas, including this Ramlila of Lucknow
 puure uttar bharat main jitani bhi ramlila hoti he usamen sabase badi bhavy or badi ramlila isi eshbagh main hoti he
 The Ramlila Committee here has been sending invitations to the Prime Minister and the President every year for the last 70 years, but for the first time a Prime Minister has been here
 11 oktober ko pradhanmantri ek ghante ke liye is ramlila me aaenge, wo dilli se sidhe sirf is kaarykram ke liye aa rahe hai or ramlila main ravan vadh kaa manchan dekhakar waapas dilli chale jaaenge

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) After taking a flight to Budapest to take part in the World Championship, i closed my eyes and started thinking about the best moments of life
 do olympic medal or oonchai par laharaata tirangaa
 Whenever i win gold on foreign land, the national anthem resonates in the stadium
 ye yaaden mujhe romanchit kar detii hai
 But sadly, this time when i stand on the podium in the World Championship, the tricolor will not fly
 mere gold jeetne par 'jan gana man' nahin bajegaa
 Because this time i am not representing India
 main vahaan sirf susheel kumaar banakar ja rahaa hum
 India is not written on my jersey
 ek olympic khilaadi ke liye isse badi niraashaa kii baat nahin ho sakati ki vah ek championships main medal jite, lekin vah medal sirf use mili, uske desh ko nahin
 i remember my friends of the army who fought the war for the tricolor and here we are, who are killed by the officers whose work is to promote sports in India
 unamem se kuch sirf vyaktigat swaarth kii vajah se apni kursiyon se chipke hue hai
 i believe that one should go on winning, not just participating in international competitions
 mujhe ummid he ki mere saathi khilaadi bhi aisa hi sochate honge
 This is an important time for the development of sports in India
 lekin pichley kuch maheene behad niraashajanak rahe hai
 There are two reasons for this
 ek, indian olympic association (ioe) kaa ravaiya, doosraa, international olympic cameti (iosi) dwaara hamaari neshnal sports body kaa suspension
 Why can't our administrators think about the country? How long will we be prevented from participating in international events as an Indian? Despite winning nine medals in the last two Olympic Games, India is in a serious crisis over the sport
 ioe halaat ke hisaab se upyukt kadam uthaanaa chahie or ek aisa maahaul bananaa chahie jisamen yuva khilaadi vishwa champion banane kaa sapana dekh saken
 Now or never
 khel main aap kabhi jitate hai, kabhi haarate hai
 But this fight is against corruption of the game
 jeetne ke alaava hamaare paas doosraa vikalp nahin he

 "he said he was allowed only 2 out of 15 places
 congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne kashmir jane kii ijaajat milane ke baad supreme court kaa aabhaar jataayaa he
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the workers who belonged to the region had gone to Kashmir to see their struggle
 sarkaar ne prayaas kiya ki log mujhase na mil paaen
 i got permission to go to my house also the other day
 15 main se sirf 2 jagah mujhe le jaaya gaya
 The Congress leader said that where everything was right, sent me there
 guest house par itani suraksha thi ki daravaaje par khadey logon ko waapas bhej diya gaya
 Large CID cameras were installed
 kai logon ne massej bheja ki ham nahin aa rahe, varanaa hamen bhaga diya jayega
 Anantnag report: i was stopped at someone's house
 muhalle menkadi surakshi barti gai
 Security was given till the door
 jo mujhase mil rahaa tha uski bhi recording kii ja rahi thi
 Baramula Report 4 days later we reached Baramula, stopped at the guest house
 kai jagah hamen jane nahin diya, jiskaa naam supreme court ko un logon kaa naam saunpa jayega
 i will not give their names out of fear, i will tell the court their names, who are starving

 Nothing is fine in the valley
 ruling party ke log centre ke dar se nahin bol rahe hai, ve bhi pareshaan hai
 CJI Ranjan Gogoi said - Ayodhya case hearing continues, no time for Kashmir is hafte relies hone vaali filmon main ek film he, 'jannisar', jiskaa nirdesan kiya he, 'gaman' or 'umrao jaan' ke nirdeshak mujffar ali ne, film main mukhya kirdaar nibhaae hai, imran abbaas, parnia kuraishi, dalip tahil, binaa kaak or khud mujaffar ali ne
 'jannisar' is a period film, in which Ishq, there is revolution against the British, ganga-jamuni is the talk of Tehzeeb and patriotism of Raqqasas
 film kii kahani main ek riyasat ke uttaradhikari amir yani imran ko bachapan main vilaayat padhane bhej diya jaataa he taaki desh main chal rahi kranti kii awaazon se vah dur rah sake or angrez is laalach main unki talim kaa bhaar uthaate hai taaki vah unke dimag main apni soch bhar saken, par hindustan lautne ke baad amir kii mulaakaat hoti he nur yani parnia se or kahani kuch or mode le lati he
 What are these diversions, for that you will have to watch the film itself, but let me tell you what my opinion is about the film
 pehle baat kar lete hai khaamiyon kii
 The first thing is that i get jerks in the screen play of the film and the film's taking is a bit weak
 matlab film kaa camera kab kahaan hona chahie, kis tarah se filmana chahie us par dhyaan dene kii jarurat thi, thodaa mujhe film kii production quality main kami lagati he, masalan jahaan aapako zyada log chahie vahaan chand logon kii bheed se kaam chalaaya gaya jo bhavyata honi chahie is tarah kii film main vah nahin dikhti
 The comments kahani ke kuch pahalu saaf nahin hote, masalan nur ek tawayph hai, par unka parichay film main ladane kii training lete hue diya gaya
 Why is it not clear? iske alaava mujhe lagata he ki bahut se darshak shaayad ganga-jamuni tahjeeb or kuch baaten jo film main kahi gai hai unase conect na kar paaen
 Now the first thing about the merits, i liked the story, i also liked some dialogues, the music of the film is amazing and i like both the lyrics and the melodies very well
 mira ali kii costum dizining kamaal kii he, parnia ek bahtareen dancer hai par abhinay par abhi kaam karne kii zarurat he
 Imran is fine in his character and the biggest thing is that while the film depicts the pre-independence situation, the message of shared culture and secularism of India was given beautifully
 to jaaiye film dekhiye, lekin yaad rahe ki yah ek tehraav vaali film he or sanjeeda vishay he, to isi soch ke saath film dekhne jaaen
 So go and watch the movie and decide for yourself, 'jannisar' from my side 2

 Some aspects of the story are not clear, for example Noor is a tawaif, but he is introduced while taking training to fight in the film
 aisa kyun he, ye saaf nahin hota
 Apart from this, i feel that many viewers may not be able to connect with the ganga-jamuni tehzeeb and some of the things that are said in the film
 ab baat khoobiyon kii to pehali baat, mujhe kahani acchhee lagi, kuch doylags bhi mujhe achche lage, film kaa sangeet kamaal kaa he or mujhe bol or dhun donon bahut achche lage
 Meera Ali's costume designing is amazing, Pernia is a great dancer but still needs to work on acting
 imran apane kirdaar main thik hai or sabase badi baat film main jahaan aazaadee se pehle kaa sthiti darshaayi gai he, vahiin hindustan kii saajha samskruti or dharmanirpekshata kaa sandesh badi khubsuurati se diya gaya
 So go watch the film, but remember that it is a stagnant film and a serious subject, then go to the film with this thought
 to jaaie or film dekhie or khud faisalaa lijie, meri taraf se 'jannisar' ko 2

 Companies such as phonepe and googlepay, which have been successful on the basis of UPI, are going to get shocked, as the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued new guidelines for digital payment companies
 UPI main concentreshan or systmetic risk ko kam karan ke liye ye guideline jari kiye gaye hai
 Share Limit One of the important provisions that NPCI has announced is to set the limit of UPI market share of digital payment companies
 is kadam se sidhe taur se upiai-only companiyon ko nuksaan hoga, jisamen walmart kaa phonpe or google pe ke saath hi jald launch hone vaali watsap pe bhi shaamil hai

 vah ise bacchon or shikshakon ke liye jaruri bataate hai, lekin aashcharya or usase kahin zyada dukhad yah he ki unhen khud nahin pataa ki shikshak diwas aakhir manaate kyon hai
 Usually on Teachers' Day and many other occasions, you may have read, heard or seen such news earlier
 lekin is baar kuch khaas he
 Especially because Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to interact with children from all over the country on the occasion of Teachers' Day
 ise lekar puure hindustan ke skulon, sarkari mahakamon or bijepi main har jagah taiyaariyaan jor-shor se chal rahi hai
 It is said that the Prime Minister will discuss the sacred relationship of the guru-shishya with the children

 Ram Naik also reminded the government and the ministers sitting in the government that he is in the role of head of state while being the governor and the Lokayukta is actually his officer, from whom he has every right to seek information when needed
 ram nike ne shivpal yadav ke bayaan par chutki lete hue yahaan tak kah diya ki lagata he unpar raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagane waalon ko samvidhan kii puri jaankaree nahin he
 Information is being collected, however, if the Lokayukta is to be believed, there is no previous history of giving lump sum information about the action taken against corruption in the last five years
 aise main ab rajyapal kii ore se chitthee bheje jane ke baad rajya ke bhrasht afasaron or netaaon se judi sari jaankaree lokayukta daftar main yudhstar par jutai ja rahi he

 canada main hua ji-7 deshon kaa do divasiy shikhar sammelan bade vivaad kii vajah ban gaya he
 US President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have come face-to-face on the tariff issue, and Trump has called Trudeau dishonest and weak in this fight
 darasal, pichley hafte hi america ne europea union, canada or mexico se steel or aluminium aayaat karne par tarriff lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 Justin Trudeau questioned the US decision, and asked for an answer
 unhone rashtriya suraksha ke naam par liye gaye is faisle ko america ke sahyogiyon ke saath yuddh main hissaa le chuke canadai sainya karmiyon kaa 'apmaan' bataaya
 Donald Trump visited Biffer and made several tweets against Trudeau after leaving the conference
 trump ne bataaya beyimantramp ne apane twit main likhaa ki piem justin trudo ne ji-7 sammelan ke dauraan bahut kii halkaa vyavhaar kiya or kaha ki america ne jo tarriff lagaae hai wo apmanjanak hai
 Trump further wrote to them as dishonest and weak, saying that our tariffs are in return for 270% of their (trudeau) on dairy
 PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our@g7meetings only to give a news conference after i left saying that, “US Tariffs were kind of insulting” and he “will not be pushed around
 ”very dishonest & weak
 Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!— Donald J
 Trump (@realdonaldtrump) June 9, 2018 Not only this, Trump also accused Justin Trudeau of making false statements in a press conference
 unhone bataaya sachai ye he ki canada america kisaanon, mazdooron or companiyon par baari tarriff laga rahaa he
 Based on Justin's false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive tariffs to our U
 S
 farmers, workers and companies, i have instructed our U
 S
 Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U
 S
 Market! - Donald j Trump (@realdonaldtrump)june 9, 2018bataa den ki isse pehle justin trudo ne uttari america mukt vyapaar samjhaute (NAFTA) or dwipaksheeya vyapaar sandhi ke america ke prastaav ko khaarij kar diya tha
 To which President Trump said that if the revised NAFTA deal is signed, he would waive the newly imposed 25 percent tariff on aluminum and steel products
 ab trudo ne kaha he ki unka desh (canada) america ke shulk lagaae jane ke khilaaf karrwai karte hue ek july se america saamaan par javaabi shulk lagayegaa

 asibi main alji kii ore se joint seepi niyukt gaye mukesh meena asibi ke offis vikaas bhawan pahunch rahe hai
 Meena has taken a detailed meeting with ACB officials
 sutron ke mutabik meena uparajyapal kaa aadesh maanenge
 He says that the point of Vigilance has no meaning
 isse pehle dilli ke uparajyapal or centre sarkaar ke saath khulkar do-do haath karne kaa man bana chuki kejariwal sarkaar ne mukesh meena ko asibi main joint seepi pad bhaar sanbhaalane se roak diya he
 Meena was appointed by Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung
 kejariwal sarkaar ne mukesh meena ko chitthee likhakar is bare main jaankaree di he
 The letter states that there is no post of Joint CP in ACB
 iske saath hi visilence sachiv ne bhi meena ko patr likhakar is tarah ke kisi post se inkaar kiya he
 In all these circumstances, now Mukesh Meena cannot join the post of Joint CP in ACB
 aam aadmi party (AAP) ne dilli main BJP kii mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaar kiran bedi ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he
 In the new poster of the party, Kiran Bedi has been described as opportunistic
 vahiin bedi bhi AAP par waar karne kaa koi mauka nahin chhod rahi hai
 i will not vote for Kejriwal, because
 
 
 main kiran bedi ko vot nahin duungaa, kyonki
 
 
 After joining BJP, Kiran Bedi has become 'opportunistic' for AAP and posters are being put up in Delhi to spread this message to the people
 AAP kabhi bedi ko 'avasarwaadi' to kabhi 'jasoos' bataa rahi he
 But perhaps there is still confusion among the leaders
 kabhi kumaar vishwaas ye aarope lagaate hai ki bedi lokapal andolan main bijepi kii jasoos ke taur par kaam kar rahi thim, to kabhi kejariwal ye kehete hai ki unhone bedi ko mukhyamantri pad kaa nyotaa diya tha
 Now the question arises from Kumar Vishwas that why did the bjp's 'spieler' invite his leader, ie Kejriwal, to become the Chief Minister? If Kumar Vishwas was trapped, the policy of the party changed, but the matter is about Bedi, so the BJP did not delay in swabbing the sword
 bandar se kejariwal kii tulana!nai dilli seat se kejariwal ke khilaaf bijepi ummidavaar noopur sharma ne kaha, 'kejariwal ek daal se duusari daal par kud rahe hai, maaf kijiega, bandar bhi kudate hai
 Speaking directly pichley saal unhone hi kaha tha ki 26 janvari kaa bahishkaar karo, isse bada deshadrohi bayaan or kuch nahin ho saktaa
 This (bedi joining BJP) became a matter of grapes being sour
 kiran bedi ne AAP nahin jwoin kiya, to kejariwal kaa dil tut gaya
 'he said,' Three elections have gone to contest in one year, power is needed, this is opportunism
 ' vahiin bijepi pravaktaa sambit paatra ne kaha, 'jab kiran bedi ji unke saath thim to kejariwal kaa maananaa tha ki kiran sahi vyakti thim dilli kii siem ke liye, kejariwal haarenge
 
 
 'interestingly, Kiran Bedi has kept silence on all the allegations of AAP
 wo ghar-ghar gum rahi hai or dilli kii janata ko bharosa jeetne main juty hai
 Prashant Bhushan also told Bedi that opportunistic well-known lawyer and senior AAP leader Prashant Bhushan also termed Kiran Bedi's decision as opportunistic and said that she has completely reversed her earlier stance on electoral politics
 prashanth ne yah bhi kaha ki bedi ko mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par pesh karne kii bijepi kii chunavi chaal naakaam ho jaaegi
 Prashant Bhushan said, "when Bedi was invited to join the party on the formation of the AAP, he said that he was not interested in electoral politics
" ab vah bijepi main shaamil hokar mukhyamantri ummidavaar bhi ban gai hai
 It is opportunistic

 Star 1
 5kalakaar-sani leone, sachin joshi or nasiruddin shahdiarector-kaijad gustadjis baat kaa andaaj lagaaya ja rahaa tha, sani leone kuch usee raah par badhati ja rahi hai
 When she made her Bollywood debut, she came up with Mahesh Bhatt, then Ekta Kapoor, and then Kaizad Gustad
 lagata he, ve yaheen chook kar baithi
 Such an omission may take him away from acting and close to the old style of showing his body
 jacopot ko dekhakar aisa hi lagata he
 The selection of this film with the film's hero Sachin Joshi may prove to be a big mistake for Sunny, Kaizad's concepts are not easily understood and they want to weave their film like some James Headley Cheese novel, but Often they are missed
 jaisaa unke saath boom ke dauraan bhi hua tha
 Perhaps viewers will not go to the ticket window just to see Sunny's body because the director always forgets that Sunny Leone has been a porn star
 bhartiya darshak unka hot andaaj to pasand karte hi hai lekin uske saath hi unhen majboot kahani or sani ko acting karte hue bhi dekhnaa he
 Do not talk about how powerful the story is
 aajkal filmon main riter to phijul hi hote ja rahe hai
 It stars Maya (sunny) and Francis (sachin)
 donon logon ko chuunaa lagane main maahir hai or ve ek bada khel khilne kaa man banaate hai or isi se sari gadabad shuru hoti he
 The story is a bit dull
 second half main thodi teji aati he
 Like Boom, the film lacks continuity
 ek samay aisa aata he ki samaj hi nahin aata he ki yah seqvence kyon daali gai he
 The story is very easy
 kuch bhi eks factor nahin he
 The rest is good for spice lovers
 star apilsni ab bhi acting ke maamle main juujhati najar aa rahi hai
 As far as showing the body is concerned, there are some scenes but it can be disappointing for the viewers who were going to see the film with this purpose only
 nasiruddin shah bhi koi chamatkaar nahin kar sake or ek samay yah baat gale se utaarani mushkil ho jaati he ki aakhir naseer ne is film ko haa kyon kiya
 After all, what kind of helplessness was there? sachin joshi ke bare main to kya kahen
 Apna paisa is your movie thing
 sabase bada rupaiyacazad ne 2003 main boom di thi or is film se katrina ko launch karne kii vajah se unhen janaa jaataa he
 Apart from this, we do not notice any of his big work
 film thriller johnor kii he or kaijad kaa andaaj he
 Therefore, for those who are fond of watching their films, this can be a good masala film
 zyada ummiden nahin kii ja sakati hai

 Now who do i go to 'bataa den ki bollywood main apni pahchaan banane se pehle ranu mandal (ranu Mondal) pashchim bengal ke ranaghat railway stesan ke paas rahete hue gaanaa gaakar apana pet paalati thim
 Some people used to give them money while listening to their songs
 yahaan tak ki ranu mandal (ranu Mondal) ke paas rahane ke liye ghar bhi nahin hota tha
 But one of his videos made him an overnight superstar
 dilli ke ek dhabas main ravivaar subah ek waiter ke juuthan khaane se inkaar karne par us par ek yuvak ne goli chalaa di haalanki waiter ko koi chot nahin aayi
 Police said a person named Rajesh, who fired, was caught with a pistol

 On refusing, he shot at Monu
 police ne bataaya ki rajesh ko pakad liya gaya jabaki use do saathi bhaag nikle
 The police has registered an FIR and is searching for the absconding youth
 is jate hue saal ko aap alavida to kah rahe hai
 But have you made the right arrangement to save memories related to this year? No, i am not talking about photos and videos
 main baat kar rahaa hum un 'jagahon' kii jo aapaki yaadgaar lamhon ke saath judi hui hai
 The 'places' you will never want to forget
 un jagahon kii, jahaan kai barason ke baad bhi aap aakar kahana chahenge– 'yahi to thi wo jagah
 
 
 'what don't we do to leave traces of our memories on the chest of the earth
 honeymoon par jate hai, to pedo ke tane par naam likh aate hai- ye sochakar, ki kabhi dobaaraa ise dekhne zarur aaenge
 Sometimes we get the name carved on the walls and put it on the walls, sometimes we rub our name on the walls with stones
 yaad rakhane ke liye ham tamaam jagahon kii photo khinch kar elbum main bhi sajaa lete hai
 But nothing remains the same
 samay ke saath, saare nishaan mit jate hai
 The tree on which you wrote the name, when it was cut
 jis chote se restra main baithkar aap donon ne pehali baar saath coffee pi thi, vahaan to ab mal ban gaya
 Forget the paper kayak and rain water of childhood - that place must have changed so much that you might not even recognize it
 dharti ke tukade kaa adress he yejise ham 'adress' kehete hai – wo bhi koi adress he! ye adress to samay ke saath gum ho jayega
 The address will remain written, the identity will change
 lekin ek 'adress' aisa bhi he, jo kabhi gum nahin hoga
 Whose identity will never change
 is adress ko aapane sahej liya to aap hameshaa bharose se kah sakenge– 'haa, bilkul, yahi thi wo jagah!' is adress kaa naam he 'latitude or Longitude' jise GPS Coordinates bhi kehete hai
 This address is also very small - like in the language of Latitude and Longitude, the address of India Gate of Delhi is 28
 6129 N, 77
 2293 e Actually this address is not of India Gate, but of the piece of earth on which India Gate is built
 isliye, ye kabhi nahin badalegaa
 Even when India Gate was not there, it was the Latitude and Longitude of this place and it will always be the same
 Latitude or Longitude kya he, aap main se zyaadaatar log ise jaanate hi honge
 This is truly 'permanent Address' because it is not an address on anything on earth, but an address of the part of the earth that never changes
 aap kitni baariki se kisi jagah kaa Latitude Longitude paa sakate hai wo is baat par nirbhar karegaa kaa aapke phone kaa jeepies resiver kitna acha he
 You can use it in this way, instead of mouthing it on the theory and i tell you the easy way to get and use it directly
 aapako chahie sirf ek smart phone jisamen internet chalata ho or jeepies laga ho
 Nowadays most smart phones have GPS facility
 haa, phone kii keemat ke hisaab se, isaki quality main fark ho saktaa he
 In your Android phone, you have to download a small, free app from the Play Store called GPS Share
 bas aapkaa kaam samajho ho gaya
 To get the Latitude and Longitude of the place you are, go to the Location Services of your phone and turn everything on
 ( Menu > Settings > Personal > Location Services)
 Wherever you are, come under the open sky to get a better GPS signal
 ab GPS Share App ko Open karen
 After waiting for a few seconds, you will have a GPS location in front of that place
 ab aap jaise chahen vaise use share karen
 If you want to keep it safe, you can send it to yourself or anyone else by email, SMS, or Whatsapp
 GPS Share se jo link miltaa he wo kuch aisa dikhegacattp: / / maps
 google
 com / maps?q=loc:28
 593299,77
 220288
 This is the same place on Google Map as soon as you click on it
 ab apane doston ko kisi nayi jagah bulaanaa ho to adras ke saath GPS Share app ke jariye hasil link bhejie
 He will not have to ask for an address to reach you
 jaise kisi dost ko aap dilli ke lodhi garden main thik usee jagah bulaanaa chaahate hai jahaan baith kar aap uskaa intjaar kar rahe hai to use use ye link bhej deohttp: / / maps
 google
 com / maps?q=loc:28

 Friend you will find it directly on these stairs of Lodhi Garden
 pedo ke tane or deevaaron par naam likhane ke bajaae, jis jagah ko yaad rakhana chahen, uskaa GPS Coordinates yani Latitude or Longitude save kar len
 In the Contacts List of the phone, with the address of someone like his home Latitude and Longitude (28
 593299,77
 220288) Write also
 jaise hi aap clic karenge, map par wo jagah aapke saamne khul jaaegi
 For this, copy only the numeric part of the link you get through GPS Share App and paste it in place of the address
 mobile se photo lene se pehle on karen jeepies tagamobile phone se koi yaadgaar photo lene se pehle, camere kii settings main jaakar jeepies tag ko on kar len
 Along with the photo, this information will also be captured in the form of Latitude and Longitude where you took this photo
 iske liye GPS Share yaa kisi or App kii koi jarurat nahin he
 After using GPS to gain latitude and longitude, do not forget to turn it off or else the phone battery will continue to be spent rapidly
 to ab ho gaya yaadon ko puri tarah sahejane kaa pakkaa intjaam
 Now you can say- 'the name will be lost, the face will change

 The selectors were looking towards the future
 lekinharbhajan sinhako team main chunakar kya chayankartaaon ne ek yuva khilaadi ke maukey ko nahin maar diya?haalanki pradarshan ke liye umr koi paimaana nahin
 If a player is useful to the team and he is doing well, then age does not matter
 lekin hamaare inhen selectors ne bade-bade diggajon ko yah kah kar team se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya tha ki ab vah buudhe ho gaye hai
 So is Harbhajan's selection in the team not unfair with those veterans today? Harbhajan is now 35 years old
 jahir 37 saal ke hone vaale hai or nehra kii umr 36 saal he
 If the recent performances of these players are seen, Nehra and Zaheer are second to none

 There is no visible off-spin bowler in first class cricket or even in IPL, which is a matter of great concern

 Is it not time to promote any talent? It was time to find an alternative to Ashwin but we went back to Harbhajan
 in dinon bharat kii tej gendbaaji ausat darje se bhi neeche najar aa rahi he
 In such a situation, do the young bowlers in Zaheer and Nehra's Kesa get any benefit? The selectors need to change their perspective
 agar ek khilaadi par umr kaa formula lagaakar unhen team se baahar kar diya jaataa he to phir duusare khilaadi par vah formula kyon nahin lagata?agar aap bhavishya kii ore hi dekh rahe hai to phir saare seniors ke liye team india ke daravaaje band hone chahie, chuninda chehron ke liye nahin
