 yahi hamaari arthvyavastha ke liye acha kadam ho saktaa tha, bharat ko trade partner kaa darja milanaa inwestors ke utsaah ko badhaane vaala ho saktaa tha
 The Congress wrote, 'the trade deal is postponed because PM Modi was behind India's long-standing foreign policy to support Donald Trump in the US elections
 aise main sawaal khadaa hota he ki modiji kii praathamiktaayen kya hai?aapako bataa den ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 22 sitambar ko america ke huston main ‘houdi modi’ kaarykram ko sambodhit kiya tha, jisamen america raashtrapati donald trump bhi shaamil hue the
 Donald Trump's participation in the event was seen as garnering support from the Indian community in the upcoming presidential election
 agar trade deal kii baat karen to mangalvaar ko donald trump or narendra modi ke bich hui dwipaksheeya vaarta main kai masalon par baat hui
 However, the trade deal is not yet finalized
 press conference main donald trump ne bayaan diya tha ki bharat ke saath america kii trade deal jald hi hogi, is masale par elaan kiya jayega
 At the same time, PM Modi said that in the coming time, up to 60 billion dollars will be invested in India by the US

 Are they angry yet? Now this is it
 
 
 
 All of you are our friends, we should be gracious and have positive questions
 siyasat ke jaankaar kehete hai ki party kii is buree haar main parivaar ke jhagade kaa bhi bahut bada role he or yah aage bhi jari rahaa to yah party ke liye ek shubh sanket nahin hoga
 Have you ever wondered why you also feel bored after seeing someone being bored? What is the time period to get bored or at what age does a person start getting bored? Though boredom is a normal physical process but we do not pay attention to many small things related to it
 haalanki doctor ubaasi ko sankramak nahin maanate hai lekin yah kaaphi had tak isi tarah badi teji se ek vyakti se duusare va duusare se tisare vyakti main failati he
 There are many misconceptions in our society about boredom
 masalan, ise neend aane yaa boriyat se jodakar dekha jaataa he? jabaki prinston vishvavidhyalay ke vaigyanikon dwaara kiye gaye research main pataa chalaa he ki ubaasi neend aane yaa boriyat kaa sanket nahin he balki yah dimag ke taapmaana ko niyantran main rakhti he
 The structure and functioning of our body is arranged in such a way that in spite of not wanting, in the event of boredom, the mouth suddenly opens
 isse dimag ko thandak to milti hi he saath main chehre kii mansapeshiyon main bhi khinchaav hota he
 According to research published in the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, boredom also compensates for the lack of oxygen in the body
 darasal, jab fefdon ko pump karne ke liye paryaapt maatra main oxigen nahin milti to vah munh se ubaasi ke jariye oxigen kii bharpai karata he
 The brain boils down to keep its walls cool
 varsh 2004 main kiye gaye ek research main yah baat nikal kar saamne ai thi ki 50 fisadi log saamne vaale ko dekhakar ubaasi lete hai
 According to research conducted in 2012, people who are genetically and emotionally connected get more boredom
 yah to spasht he ki insaanon ke saath jaanavar sahit kai anya prajatiyaan bhi ubaasi leti hai
 But do you know that a fetus starts getting pregnant from the 11th week in the mother's womb
 aamtaur par ubaasi kii samyavadhi chah senkad kii hoti he
 But sometimes it becomes a little more than this
 manushya apane jeevankaal main ausatan 240,000 baar ubaasi letaa he
 Researchers at the US National Institutes of Health have found out in research that excessive boredom in humans also explains a lot
 masalan, yadi aapako thodi-thodi der main ubaasi aa rahi he to yah anidra kii nishaani he, jisase aage chalakar kai tarah kii bimaariyaan ho jaati he
 It also has a side effect on the body even when it is not prevented
 isliye chikitsak bhi kehete hai ki ubaasi aane par ise rokna nahin chahie
 Input IANS supreme court ne mangalvaar ko ek aitihaasik faisla sunaate hue talaak-e biddat ko khatm kar diya he
 That is, no Muslim person will be able to divorce his wife by speaking three times together
 paanch jajon kii sanvaidhanik peeth ke teen jajon ne ye faisla diya
 While the other two judges asked the central government to make laws, the triple talaq was ordered to be stayed until the law is made
 court ne muslimon main talaak kii is pratha ko amaanya, avaidh or asanvaidhanik qaraar diya
 The Constitutional Bench of five judges gave this verdict by a vote of 3: 2
 faisle main teen talaak ko quran ke mul tatv ke khilaaf bataaya gaya
 Chief Justice of India JS Khehar and Justice s Abdul Nazeer were in favor that the government should bring a new law in this regard by banning the practice of triple talaq for six months
 alpamat vaale is faisle main donon jajon ne ye bhi kaha ki agar centre sarkaar 6 maheene ke andar kanoon lekar nahin aati to teen talaak par uskaa aadesh jari rahegaa yani roak jari rahegi
 On the other hand, the remaining three members of the bench, Justice Kurian Joseph, Justice RF Nariman and Justice UU Lalit, called the practice a violation of the Constitution
 bahumat vaale is faisle main kaha gaya ki teen talaak samet har wo pratha asweekaarya he, jo quran ke mul tatv ke khilaaf he
 In their judgment, these three judges also said that the practice of giving divorce through triple talaq is clearly voluntary
 yah samvidhan kaa ulanghan he or ise hataaya janaa chahie
 The Center was not in favor of triple talaq
 It is worth mentioning that a bench of 5 judges was hearing the issue
 court main yah sunwaayee 6 dinon tak chali thi
 The Central Government, in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, had made it clear that it does not consider the practice of triple talaq as valid and in favor of continuing it
 sunwaayee ke dauraan atorni general mukul rohtagi ne teen talaak ko 'dukhadaayi' pratha qaraar dete hue nyaayalay se anurodh kiya tha ki vah is maamle main 'moulik adhikaron ke abhibhavak ke rup main kadam uthaae
 'who had filed the petition? The hearing in the Supreme Court began after the appeals of Saira Banu, Afreen Rahman, Gulshan Parveen, Ishrat Jahan and Atiya Sabri
 sabhi kii ore se teen talaak ke alaava nikaah halaala or bahuvivaah ke mudde par yachika daayar kii gai thi
 But the court said that we will give verdict on only three divorces

 Who was on the defense side? There is All India Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) in the defense on this issue

 The bench of these five judges pronounced the verdict 1

 Justice YU Fine 5
 justise abdul nazirye thi muslim personal lau board kii dalilvahin ol india muslim personal lau board kii ore se vakil kapil sibbal ne kaha tha ki teen talaak kaa pichley 1400 saal se jari he
 If Ram's birth in Ayodhya can be a matter of faith, then why not the issue of triple talaq
 modi ne laal kile se kii thi baat15 agast ko laal kile se die apane bhaashan main piem ne kaha tha ki teen talaak ke kaaran kuch mahilaon ko kaaphi pareshaani jhelni pad rahi hai, teen talaak se peedit bahanon ne desh main andolan khadaa kiya, media ne unki madad kii
 i congratulate the sisters who have organized the movement against triple talaq, the whole country will help them
 court ke is faisle ke baad se hi tripal talaak par bain lagu ho gaya he
 That is, from Tuesday onwards, if any Muslim man divorces his wife three times together, then it will not be valid

 input-bhashaa Mohammad Hanif is mumbling something at a stall standing on the side of the line of note exchangers near Goldak Khan, after discovering that Mohammad Hanif is busy fighting for his new account, that too of his son
 ek saptaah pehle tak bete kaa daakghar main khaataa khulwaane kaa koi plan nahin tha, lekin ab wo line main lagakar nae khate ke liye farm bhar rahe hai, poochne par kehete hai, modi ji ne to elaan kar diya, lekin aam aadmi par kya biit rahi he, ye vahi jaanate hai
 There is a line in every bank, you cannot even think to exchange notes and withdraw money, because every bank is crowded
 aise main nayaa khaataa khulwakar usamen paisa jamaa karnaa zyada aasaan lag rahaa he
 Banks and post offices have set up counters separately for opening new accounts, there is less congestion, there is no hassle of delay in the line and the account is opening quickly
 to bete ke naam khaataa khulwakar usamen ab paisa jamaa karenge
 Mohammad Hanif is not the only person who has adopted an easy way to deposit his money in Cobank
 unki tarah hi sanjay bhi nayaa khaataa khulwaane ke liye daakghar ke counter par farm bharte nazar aaye
 According to Sanjay, he still has an account with another bank, but when he reached to change the money at the Gol post office, it came to know that the line is very long, but at the same time it is known that a new account is to be opened, there is a separate counter and There is not much crowd here
 ek saath kitna paisa bhi jamaa kara sakate hai or haath ke haath kharche laayak paisa nikaal bhi sakate hai
 Just got to talk to Sanjay and immediately decided to open a new account
 hanif or sanjay jaisi kahani bahut saare logon kii he, jo in dinon ek hi baat kii jugad main hai ki kaise bhi ghar main rakhe note badali ho jaaen yaa phir bank main jamaa kara diye jaaen, lekin pareshaani us vakt shuru hoti he jab bain k ke saamne pahunchate he, jahaan lambii lambii line lagi hoti he
 Banks and post offices have also made this opportunity a golden opportunity to make their customers
 pehle logon se nayaa khaataa khulwaane ke liye mannaten kerani padati thi, lekin ab log khud unke paas khaataa khulwaane ke liye pahunch rahe hai
 People are getting convenience and banks are getting new customers
 note kii dikkat to kuch maheenon main khatm ho jaaegi, lekin majaburi main khulaa khaataa to baad tak jari rahegaa

 If Prime Minister Narendra Modi could make big and direct changes in people's lives through demonetisation, he would be the first politician in the modern era who changed the basic parameters of reforms
 pratyaksh badlaavon se matlab aisi tarakkee he, jo deng shyaoping (1978-84) ke sudhaaron ke baad china main, ronaald reagan (1981-89) ke jariye america main, margaret thatcher (1979-90) ke jariye britain main or 1991-1995 ke sudhaaron ke baad bharat main najar ai
 These reforms gave unprecedented positive strength to the socio-economic structure of these countries for a long time
 adhikansh aarthik parivartanon kii buniyaad kisi taatkaalik rajnatik, aarthik yaa saamaajik sankat se taiyaar hui he
 On this scale, Narendra Modi is the first leader who has invited the crisis for reform
 notebandi ek bada aarthik sudhaar he, lekin philhal iske chalate vishwa kii sabase tej daudti arthvyavastha sabase teji se sust padati arthvyavastha main badal gai he or daudta hua desh naukariyaan, sukun va aarthik aazaadee ganvaakar bich raah main khadaa ho gaya he
 In the latest history of the country, there are two such decisions which are parallel to the demonetization of Narendra Modi on the basis of the circumstances and impact
 donon hi faisle, sankat se upje the alabatta nattejey ek-duusare se vipareet the
 That 6
 6
 66 was only when Indira Gandhi made 35 rupees
 5 fisadi avamulyan kiya
 It was only a few months after Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister after the death of Lal Bahadur Shastri
 mandi va sookhe or rajnatik chunautiyon ke bich yah bukamp jaisaa faisla is ummid ke saath hua ki videshi puunji aegi, niryaat badhegaa or america sahit anya deshon se milane vaali sahaayta bad jaaegi
 However, devaluation proved to be a big mistake
 antarrashtriya sahyog nahin mila or sankat badhate chale gaye
 After this reform, the economic cycle of the country turned around
 license permit raaj aa gaya
 The MRTP Act was created and the banks were nationalized with the promise of making the money deposited in private banks to the public
 yah andhaa yug 1991 main aarthik sudhaaron ke saath khatm hua
 On July 1, 1991, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, while devaluing the rupee, against the backdrop of the payment crisis and mortgage abroad
 6
 66 was scaring them
 raav ke netritv main pehla avamulyan (7 fisadi) 1 july ko hua
 The second (9 per cent) was to be held on 3 July
 1 july ke faisle par pratikriya ke baad pradhanmantri raav hichak gaye
 On the morning of 3 July he called Finance Minister Manmohan Singh to stop the next devaluation, but by then the Reserve Bank Governor C
 rangarajan faisla lagu kar chuke the
 The result of this devaluation was completely opposite to that of 1966
 bharat ko turant videshi madad mili, lekin iskaa vaastavik asar 1995 ke baad najar aayaa jab bharat dablutio kaa hissaa bana
 Restrictions on imports were lifted between 1996 and 2000
 iske baad arthvyavastha khulti, failati gai or logon kii aay badhati chali gai
 When Prime Minister Modi underwent demonetisation on 8 November, India was the fastest running economy in the world in the midst of the global recession, whose foundation was built by these reforms
 uthal-puthal paidaa karne vaale aarthik sudhaaron kaa itihaas do bade nishkarsh lekar aata he
 First, most of the successful reforms eventually lent citizens freedom and power and created a new middle class
 reagan ke sudhaar sarkari niyantran kam karne, mudrasphiti thaamne or nijee udhyamita ko badhaane par kendrit the
 The result was rapid growth of the eighties, new jobs and faster consumption
 lebar union or samrudh tabake ke bich bante tatkaaleen britain main thatcher kaa package bhi mukt bazaar, sarkari companiyon ke nijeekaran, mahangaai par niyantran or sarkaar ko simit rakhane par aadhaarit tha, jisane britain main thatcher samarthak nayaa middle class taiyaar kiya
 Deng Xiaoping's reforms in China began with the aim of increasing the income of a large population
 in sudhaaron ne china ko duniya kii bejod aarthik takat banaaya or 70 karod logon ko garibi se nijaat dekar duniya kaa sabase bada madhya varg bana diya
 Second, most of the reforms were due to economic and social needs, whose political benefits were later seen
 dimonetigeshan bharat main aazaadee ke baad kii sabase badi aarthik uthal-puthal he, jo pradhanmantri kii taraf se tay seemaa ke mutabik apane aakhri charan main pahunch rahi he
 The immediate consequences are less relief and more prick
 is sudhaar ne aam logon kii aarthik aazaadee ko simit kar diya he
 Before Modi came to power, a middle class was ready which is restless about increase in employment, income, expenditure and consumption
 vah is sudhaar ke robin hud model (amiron ko sajaa, garibon ko raahat) se romanchit to he lekin badhate dard ke saath ashankaon or amoort ummiido ke bich jhul rahaa he
 This reform threatens to increase government control over the economy
 is sudhaar ke rajnatik lakshya to dikhte hai, pratyaksh aarthik phaaydon kii tasviir abhi taiyaar honi he
 Time will tell whether Narendra Modi proves to be Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan, but if demonetisation gave India the results of reforms like 1991 even after five years, history will be written with the fact that to give new strength to society and economy There is no harm in weakening

 unhone kaha ki 'saat nishchay' janata ke saath chhalaava he or sarkari sansadhano kaa durupyog he
 He asked the question that why the state government has proved to be a complete failure on the issue of education, health, irrigation, public distribution system, women empowerment, security among the claims of development? Why is the system in disarray? There is no system for this in the 'seven Definitions'

 com / ucnnck19kp jo parampara khushiyon kii jagah dehshat failaae, jo parampara khubsuurati kii jagah ghrinaa failaae, jo parampara bacchon ko hansaane kii jagah rulaae ham use parampara kaise kahenge
 There is a tradition in Karnataka that plays with the lives of children
 karnataka ke bijapur main parampara ke naam par kareeb 16 se 20 feet kii unchai se dudhmuhe bachche ko neeche phenkaa jaataa he
 Children cry out of fear, but there is such a noise of superstition that the cry of crying children is suppressed
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki ye sab hota he mata pita kii marji se
 This tradition has been going on for years in the Shri Santheshwara temple of Bijapur
 manyata he ki 14veen shatabdi ke is mandir main har muraad puri hoti he
 The parents who ask for a child's vow carry out the hypocrisy of this tradition when the wishes are fulfilled
 mana jaataa he ki isse baccha swasthy rahata he or jindagi bhar samrudh rahata he
 Surprisingly, despite knowing the risk, the administration never tried to stop it
 sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki parampara ke naam par yun bacchon kii jindagi daanv par lagane kaa adhikaar kisne diya
 Does the parent have any right to put the lives of children at such risk? insaan ke liye ye jaruri he ki wo apane aap ko samay de or jivan kaa anand le
 Every human has certain desires of life which he wants to fulfill
 kariyar, relationships, shaadi or phir parivaar kii jimmedaariyon ke boj main ham jindagi jeena hi bhul jate hai
 Everything has its own time, so it is better to do them before that time comes
 isse pehle ki aap 30 kii umr ko paar karen, aapako in chote-chote anubhavon se jarur guzarana chahie
 
 
 1- Make love - Just as a body needs water to live, so does the soul of love
 bina pyaar ke insaan jivan main adhuraa hi rah jaataa he
 It is important that before marriage, girls should openly love everything they love and which is part of their life
 pregnancy ke dauraan twachaa main hone vaali samasyaayein or upaay2- apane dar par paaen kaabo-aksar aisa dekha gaya he ki har insaan kaa bachapan se kisi cheez ko lekar ek dar hota he
 Many are afraid of water, of height, of depth
 kai logon ko bhoot-pret kaa vaham hota he
 Girls are often afraid of cockroaches, mice, lizards
 ye jaruri he ki wo is dar par kaabo paaen or khulkar jeene kii kala seekhen
 This will infuse more confidence in them
 3- kuch pal rahen akele-insaan ke liye jaruri he ki wo kuch pal akele rahane kii koshish karen
 By the way, friends have a pleasant feeling together
 magar kabhi-kabhi akele rahane ke bhi kai phaayde hai
 With this you can feel freedom completely and can get closer to yourself
 4- kam se kam aapke paas ek chaabi ho-agar aap koi job kar chuki hai or apni mehnat se aapane paise kamaaye hai to aapke liye ye behatar hoga ki aap un paison se apane liye koi khaas cheez khariden
 You can buy a car or apartment from it or something special
 aisa karne par aapako khud par garv mahasoos hoga
 Never ask a woman after marriage, these 7 things 5- Do some adventure - It is also important to do some exciting things in life
 aap agar apane aapako aisa kuch karne kaa chalange denge or use nibhaayenge to ye aapako urja se sarabor kar degaa or wo kuch pal aapke jeevanabhar ke anant palon se kai guna zyada aanandamay hoga
 6- Visit abroad - every human's dream is to see the world outside his country
 vahaan ke rahan-sahan or khan-paan kaa anand le saken or vahaan kii samskruti se waakif ho saken
 After marriage, girls get an opportunity to travel abroad with their life partner, but if they go to visit abroad with their friends or alone before marriage, then it will be recorded in memorable moments for their future life
 7- kuch nayaa seekhen-siikhnaa jivan kaa wo bhaag he jo aapako hameshaa pehle se behatar banane main madad karata he
 Something should always be learned in life
 agar aap 30 kii umr se pehle koi rochak cheez sikh jaaengi to ye jeevanabhar aapaki shakhsiyat main chaar chand laga degaa
 8- Get comfortable with your body - Even though you have rated yourself less than others in Teenage, but before you reach the age of 30, you must learn to be comfortable with your body
 aap jaisi hai, us rup main khud ko saraahen
 Your life will be easier than before
 janmajaat hoti he Marfan Sydrome naamak beemaari, aise pahachaanen lakshan9- rakhen khud ko feet-20 se 25 saal kii umr insaan ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn hoti he
 During this time you need to keep yourself fit
 is samay kii laaparvaahee baad main hanikaarak sabit ho sakati he
 10- Change Style - Staying in a look can make anyone feel bored
 aap ke aas-paas ke log bhi ye chaahate hai ki aap nae luks apanaaen
 You can color your hair
 iske alaava aap nayaa heirkat apana sakati hai yaa apni pasand kaa tatu lagava sakati hai
 11- Love animals and nature - Raising pets or planting trees or plants is not a part of your hobby, even if you try to make them a part of your life
 isse aap care karnaa seekhengi or kisi kii phikr karnaa bhi aapke vyavhaar main aa jayega
 12- Self-protection - Being self-reliant is essential for everyone today
 aapako khud ko shaareerik or maansik rup se majboot banane kii jarurat he
 You can practice things like Judo, Karata, Yoga, Pranayam
 isse aap khud main kaaphi sakasham or sampurna mahasoos karenge
 13- Spend quality time - time passes very quickly and once gone time never comes back
 isliye jaruri he ki aap ek baar jarur quality time bitaayen
 You set the priorities of work and do not allow time to be spent in any way
 14- koi ek nai bhashaa jarur seekhen-kai sari bhashaaon kaa gyaan aapke vyaktitv main ek nikhaar laa degaa
 Learning more languages can prove beneficial in many ways
 15- maaf karnaa seekhen-aadmi galatiyon kaa putala hota he
 Mistakes happen to a known or unknown person
 galtiyaan rishton main khatas laane kaa kaam karti hai
 It is better that you forgive the mistakes
 agar aap kisi ko maaf karke kisi rishte ko bachaane main safal hoti hai to baad main aapako acha mahasoos hoga
 There is a mountain of challenges before the Modi government, which has returned with a strong majority in the country
 kuch chunautiyaan pichley paanch varshon ke dauraan system se upji hai to kai chunautiyaan chunaav jeetne ke dauraan kiye gaye vaadon se bhi khadi hui hai
 Now how will the Modi government overcome them, it will be a matter to be seen
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii aguwai vaale endie ne 2014 kaa bhi record todate hue 351 siten hasil kii hai to upie sau siton tak simat gai, jabaki anya ke khate main bhi 91 siten ai hai
 Know which are the challenges that the Narendra Modi government will have to face
 anuchhed 370loksabhaa chunaav kii reliyon main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah khulkar kah chuke hai ki dobaaraa bahumat se sarkaar bani to jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hatega
 This article gives privileges to Jammu and Kashmir
 sansad se paas kai kanoon yahaan lagu nahin hote
 After the results of the Lok Sabha elections, the outgoing Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has also given a statement that after forming the government, he will work on Sections 370 and 35A
 udhar jammu-kashmir ke kshetreey dal kai baar kah chuke hai ki dhara 370 se chhedchhad karne par ghati sulag uthegi
 PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, once a BJP ally, has also threatened to face the consequences
 sansad main prastaav laakar bijepi anuchhed 370 hataane main kaise safal hogi, yah badi chunauti hogi
 The weak position in the Rajya Sabha: In the Rajya Sabha, the BJP is the largest party at the moment with 73 mps
 magar endie kii siten jodakar bhi vah 123 ke bahumat ke aankade tak nahin pahunchati
 a majority is required to pass resolutions in the Rajya Sabha
 aise main bijepi rajyasabha main bahumat ke sankat kaa kaise saamana karti he, yah dekhne vaali baat hogi
 If we talk about seats, then the Congress has 50 members
 jabaki samaajawaadee party , ediemke or trinmul congress ke paas 13-13 saansad hai
 The UPA also does not have a majority in the upper house
 magar upie ke alaava anya vipakshi dalon ko bhi jod den to unka aankada 150 se upar baithta he
 Sources reveal that now if the BJP wins a bumper victory in the state elections held after the Lok Sabha, then only the seats in its Rajya Sabha can be increased
 arthvyavastha kii halataloksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan kai aarthik vishleshkon ne yah kaha tha ki nai sarkaar ke saamne lachar arthvyavastha se nipatane kii chunauti hogi
 Because the jaw of recession is tightening on the economy
 udyan se lekar doorsanchaar tak sabhi kaarobaar main giravat darj ho rahi he
 The report of the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, published in India Today, raised several serious concerns about the economy
 kaha gaya ki shadow banking kshetra bhi baari sankat main he, jiske rin baantne ke paimaane saral hai
 The report also spoke of the IL&FS group being at the mouth of the collapse, which has funded large infrastructure businesses
 india today kii report main kaha gaya ki desh ke kul 90 karod main se 30 karod matadaata sankat main hai
 This large section of the economically weak does not have a secure job nor other facilities
 yah aankada india today ne sankatagrast kshetron main pratyaksh or paroksh rup se jude voters kii gananaa se hasil kiya
 The high unemployment government report has also revealed that unemployment reached a high rate in the previous government
 jabaki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii campaning ke vakt bijepi ne har saal do karod rojgaar dene kii baat kahi thi
 Which the opposition continued to make an issue in the election
 modi sarkaar ko pichley paanch varshon main berogari ko lekar sabase zyada hamale jhelane pade
 And the NSSO report shows that the unemployment rate in the country is a record 6 after 1972-73
 1 ke str par pahunch gai he
 While this figure 2 in 2011-12
 2 pratishat tha
 CNIE 1 in 2018
 1 karod naukariyaan chhinane kii baat kahi
 Clearly, dealing with unemployment is a big challenge in the second innings of the Modi government
 kashmir muddnarendra modi sarkaar pichley paanch saal main koi aisi thos niti nahin bana saki, jisase ghati main shanti laai ja sake
 The incidents of stone pelting increased considerably in the last years
 yah digar he ki kashmir samasya ke hal ke liye modi sarkaar ne sabhi pakshon se baatcheet kii pahal kii
 For this, former Director of Intelligence Bureau Dineshwar Sharma was also appointed
 magar jaruri rigelt nahin dikhe
 Kashmir's condition worsened since 2016, when violent demonstrations began after the Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Muzaffar Wani was killed in the encounter
 algaavvaadi or sena kaa lagaataar aamanaa-saamana hota rahaa
 Relationship with neighbors: What will improve relations with neighboring countries in the second term of Modi government? is par bhi sabhi kii nigahen rahengi
 Actually, if there was a dispute with China about Doklam, Pakistan did not desist from its misdeeds
 jisase donon deshon ke saath rishton main tanaav bana rahaa
 When India raised the issue of declaring Masood Azhar as a global terrorist at the United Nations, China stopped using the veto
 mitra raashtra kahe jane vaale nepal se bhi sambandh pehle kii tarah behatar nahin rahe
 During the Madhesi movement in Nepal, India had stopped the supply of goods like petrol, medicine etc
 during the blockade
 jisase nepal kii janata or sarkaar main bharat ko lekar naaraazgi dekhne ko mili
 Law on social fabric is a state subject, but during the last 5 years, there have been allegations about social fabric in the Modi government on the basis of some incidents in the country
 vajah ki zyaadaatar rajyon main bijepi kii hi sarkaar he
 There have been several incidents of mob lynching in many states, which was also taken into consideration by the Supreme Court
 samudaay vishesh ke utpeedan ke aarope lage
 Violence by cow vigilantes also surfaced in many places
 aise main is nae turm main sampradayik or saamaajik taana-bana par aanch na pahunche, yah bhi modi sarkaar ke saamne chunauti he

 The Indian captain had said that the fielding of senior players Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir is loose, causing the team to lose around 20 runs
 sahvaag ne haalanki baad main yah kahkar ise nayaa mode de diya tha ki unhen roteshan kaa yah kaaran nahin bataaya gaya he
 Bedi also appealed to the players to keep distance from the media

 Bedi, who was strongly critical of Dhoni's rotation policy, admitted that the Indian team had failed in every department on the Australian tour
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ab to daura samaapt hone kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The team's confidence has been badly shaken
 ’’ This veteran spinner of his time made this comment about Dhoni's statement which he had recently made about the rotation policy
 bhartiya captain ne kaha tha ki senior khilaadiyon sachin tendulkar, virendra sahvaag or gautam gambhir kaa kshetrarakshan dhilaa he, jisase team ko lagbhag 20 ran ganvaane padate hai
 However, Sehwag later gave it a new twist by saying that he has not been told the reason for the rotation
 bedi ne iske saath hi khilaadiyon se media se duuri banaae rakhane kii apil bhi kii
 He said, "I am happy that in our time the media was not so dominant
 khilaadiyon ko media se duuri banaae rakhni chahie
 Not everyone needs to come to the media

 "he said," If the players only have to speak, then what is the job of the media manager

 He said, "this is what Kapil believes

 This is their monopoly
 yah unka faisla hoga, kisi anya ko us par bolne kaa adhikaar nahin hona chahie
 '' bedi ne kaha, ‘‘aakhir unke mahashatak kaa intjaar kise nahin he
 Everybody is talking about his great century and also pointing a sword at him

 During the discussion on the no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha on Friday, Congress President Rahul Gandhi suddenly moved closer to PM Modi, speaking in favor of the no-confidence motion and shook hands with PM Modi and hugged him
 dinabhar rahul gandhi ke is vyavhaar kii charchaa hoti rahi
 To which Prime Minister Narendra Modi responded as Rahul Gandhi's rapture
 darasal congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne jab apana bhaashan khatm kiya tab achaanak rahul pradhanmantri modi ke paas pahunch gaye or unhen uthne ke liye kaha
 PM was shocked at this behavior of Rahul
 piem ne unki taraf haath badhaaya lekin rahul gandhi haath na milaate hue piem ke gale lag gaye
 Making fun of Rahul Gandhi's behavior, PM Modi said in his own way that he is surprised that when the discussion on the motion of no confidence was started this morning, there was no voting, no decision of victory or defeat
 jinhe yahaan pahunchane kaa utsaah he ki utho utho utho
 
 
 
 na yahaan koi uthaa saktaa he na bitha saktaa he
 Only 125 crore Indians can do this
 pradhanmantri narendra modi necongress adhyaksh rahul gandhike bayaan kaa zikr kiya jisamen rahul ne kaha tha ki jab ve bolenge tab bukamp aa jayega, pradhanmantri unke saamne khadey bhi nahin paaenge
 In response, the Prime Minister said that there was no earthquake and i am standing here and adamant on my work
 pradhanmantri ne congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki darasal yah avishvaas prastaav unki sarkaar kaa floor test nahin he, balki congress ke apane saathiyon main vishwaas kaa floor test he

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has reacted sharply to the statement made by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on the statement of Bollywood actor Naseeruddin Shah
 bijepi pravaktaa sambit paatra ne kaha he ki jo desh apni dharti par aatankwaad ko prashray detaa ho, jahaan khud dharmik alpsankhyakon kii haalat badtar ho, jiske paas khud khaane ke liye na ho, unase sikh lene kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Congress, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra, who considers Imran Khan as an angel, said that Pakistan which keeps Osama bin Laden in hiding, which supports the Taliban, does not tell us what humanity is
 paatra ne kaha ki pakistan khud karj main duba hua he, pehle apni roti kaa jugad kar le phir hamen sikh de
 He said that the Congress party definitely considers Imran Khan an angel, says that what Imran did not happen in so many years
 gauratlab he ki pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne bollywood abhinayta nasiruddin shah dwaara alpsankhyakon kii suraksha ko lekar jataai gai chintaa ko lekar samarthan jataate hue kaha tha ki pakistan ke nirmaataa mohammad ali jinna ko pehle se hi pataa tha ki congress jis aaazaad mulk kii maang kar rahi he, usamen musalamaanon ko barabari kaa darja hasil nahin hoga
 Therefore, they demanded a separate Pakistan for Muslims
 imran khan ne kaha tha ki ki wo bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi sarkaar ko dikhaaenge ki alpsankhyakon se kaise vyavhaar karte hai? unhone daawa kiya tha ki unki sarkaar yah sunishchit karne ke liye kadam uthaa rahi he ki pakistan main dharmik alpsankhyakon ko unkidhikaar mili
 Explain that while referring to the Bulandshahr violence, Bollywood actor Naseeruddin Shah said that in today's era, the cow's life is more valuable than a police inspector
 unhone kaha tha ki unhen apane bacchon kii suraksha kii phikr hoti he kyonki unhone apane bacchon ko majahabi talim nahin di

 In view of the ever increasing pollution in Delhi, the Central Government has taken a major decision
 isse nipatane ko dilli main agle saal april se hi eendhan ke liye BS-VI ke niyam lagu honge
 The Ministry has decided to implement the norms of BS-6 instead of BS-4 from April 2018
 pehle in norms ko 2020 se lagu karne kii yojana thi
 Increasing pollution worries: Due to the increasing level of pollution in Delhi, people living here are facing a lot of trouble
 neshnal green tribunel bhi isko lekar kai baar chintaa jataa chukaa he
 Not only Delhi, pollution levels are also continuously increasing in its surrounding areas
 is vajah petroleum mantralay ne bies-6 norms ko 2020 kii jagah agle saal hi lagu karne kaa faisla liya he
 6 months will be available According to the new instructions of the Ministry, Delhi has only 6 months to shift from BS-4 Norms to BS-6
 petroleum mantralay ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki dilli or usase sate ilaakon main badhate pradooshan ko dekhte hue yah faisla liya gaya he
 It also suggested that oil companies have been asked to consider selling BS-6 auto fuel in Delhi NCR from 2019
 petroleum mantralay ne 2020 kii jagah 2018 main bies-6 norms lagu karne ko lekar sabhi hissedaaron se baat karne ke baad hi yah faisla liya he
 At present, this decision has been taken only for petrol and diesel
 BS 6 kii gadiyon ke liye 2020 kii jo samay seemaa tay kii gai he philhal usamen koi badlaav nahin kiya gaya he
 It means to say that from next year in Delhi the vehicles will be of BS-4 but petrol and diesel will be of BS 6 level
 kya he BS-6BS-6 kaa matlab he bharat stage 6
 To measure how much pollution the vehicles cause, a scale named Bharat Stage has been created
 philhal desh main bharat stage 4 kii gaadiyaan chal rahi hai
 The first government program was to implement Bharat Stage 5 vehicles and oil from 2018
 lekin sarkaar ne baad main faisla kiya ki bharat stage 5 ke bajaay sarkaar 2020 main sidhaa bharat stage 6 lagu karegi
 The Bharat Stage 6 vehicles have very little pollution and match the pollution regulations applicable in the best countries of the world
 ab dilli ke pradooshan ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne petrol dijal main to bharat stage 6 lagu karne kii samay seemaa ko 2 saal pehle kar diya he lekin gadiyon main BS-6 lagu hone kii samay seemaa abhi bhi 2020 hi he
 Experts say that if Bharat Stage 6 oil will be poured into the Bharat Stage 4 trains, then there will not be full benefit in reducing pollution but the situation will definitely be better than now

 Karnataka authorities and a company based in Chennai-based Pacwaddu Food Group had conspired to give energy powder pills to Anganwadi children by not giving them hot and cooked food
 india today kii padtaal se pataa chalaa he ki centre or rajya kii 54,000 karod ru
 Under the Integrated Child Development Scheme of ICDS (ICDS), in September 2007, a deal to give 'nutri Powders' to children in about 61,000 Anganwadis in the state was done with a relative of a politician who is now under suspicion
 pouderon ke aath mishranon kaa suzav diya gaya, jisamen upama, sade or mithe chaaval kaa powder shaamil tha
 They replaced freshly cooked food such as rice and green gram, and reportedly filled the pockets of producers — Christy Friedgram — and the politicians and officials who approved the deal
 india today ne rajyabar main jin anganwari karmiyon se baat kii, unka kahana he ki bachche in energy pouderon ko khaanaa nahin chaahate
 Anganwadi worker Sarojamma (name changed) of Davanagere district says, "earlier we used to give them real food, which came from local sources, was fresh and nutritious
 ye powder fortyphoid bhale hon, lekin bachche inhen khaanaa nahin chaahate
 There were earlier cases of malnutrition, but now we have serious cases
 bacchon main khilne laayak takat nahin hoti, ve zyada bolte bhi nahin hai
 "fortified powders are good as a supplementary food," says Bangalore-based pediatrician Shubha Badami
 lekin agar in bacchon ke paas ghar par khaane ke liye bhojan nahin he, to in pouderon se koi phayda nahin hota
 After the death of 5-year-old Anjaneya and her two-year-old sister Mahalakshmi in Raichur, Anganwadi workers demonstrated in Bangalore on 13 September by placing bags of this food powder on their heads
 rajya ke mahila evam bal kalyaan vibhaag kaa aadhikarik bayaan yah he ki in bacchon kii maut ''mand buddhi'' ke kaaran hui he
 But no explanation has been given as to how death can be caused by retarded intelligence
 ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, ''file main bataaya gaya kaaran yah he ki khaadya main ekarupata honi chahie or fortyphoid khaadya zyada paushtik hote hai
 This is understandable so much, but after that nobody did anything

 In this regard, the then Chief Minister H

 The energy food balls tasted like raw dough, while the Bisi Belle Bath (kannadiga edible), which had packed powder and a spoonful of rice, smelled of stale oil and asafoetida in the powder

 tab se packwdgarh khaadya main ganvaae ja chuke hai
 This happened despite protests from social workers at all places and an October 2004 Supreme Court order directing that children should be given only freshly cooked food
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne bhi june 2008 main choudhary ko yah kehete hue ek note bheja tha ki chote bacchon ke bhojan kaa strot sthaneey hona chahie or vah taaja pakaaya gaya hona chahie, packwdgarh nahin
 It was approved by the Union Cabinet in October 2008

 Most states have opted for packaged food at different times, which conveys how powerful corporate lobbies have sniffed out the rich profits associated with ICDS

 After this, Shivmohan Singh, the head of Sukhi Panchayat in Vaishali district was shot dead in Muzaffarpur district on 11 September
 baby devi ke pati abhaya kishor kaa kahana he ki bablu singh ne ek saal tak intjaar kiya, kyonki use lagata tha ki baby dabaav main aa jaaegi
 According to him, "he probably did not want to kill a woman
" ''lekin har koi mukhiya itnaa samay hasil nahin kar sakaa
 In many cases, the domineering people have not delayed even a moment to play political enmity
 june, 2011 main madhepura jile main navnirvaachit mukhiya shivanandan mandal ko mukhiya pad kii shapath lene se pehle hi badi berahami se maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 The assassination of the chiefs began just before the 2011 panchayat elections, when candidates started calculating each other outside the electoral arena
 bihar main mukhiya ko jitani shakti mili he, usne sabase acchhee or sabase buree donon tarah kii pratibhaaon ko apni ore aakarshith kiya he
 In Bihar, apart from giving liquor smuggling, manufacture of illegal weapons and betrothed to murders, many chiefs have also been arrested for corruption offenses

 The Panchayati Raj department of Bihar has been able to do so much so that the men of their families do not attend the meeting in place of the female head
 is sab ke baavjood ab bhi asli takat purushon ke haathon main hi bani hui he
 Worse still, many male relatives have taken the help of murderers with a betel nut to hide rivals in the panchayat and turned political rivalry into a murder conspiracy
 is tarah sthaneey swa-shashan bihar ke liye ek boj ban saktaa he

 " Virender Sehwag is not in Team India these days
 media se dur rahanaa zyada pasand karte hai isliye tivi channelon or akhabaaron main bhi najar nahin aate
 But on the way from Gurgaon to Jhajjar, a big board reminds me of this smoky batsman of Team India
 ye board he sahvaag ke skool kaa
 In the picture on it, he does not play cricket, and is seen inspiring children wearing suit-boots to go to school
 sahvaag kaa naam hi kaaphi he, sahvaag international skool ke kad kaa andaja lagane ke liye
 Every person visiting Jhajjar suddenly stops seeing this magnificent building built amidst the greenery of Haryana
 viru se mulaakaat kii koshish kai dinon se thi, ab jaakar mauka mila
 The condition was that we would meet only in our school
 skool main pravesh karte hi hamaara saamana ek shandaar aadhunik building or bade-bade maidaanon se hua
 When i went inside, all the merits of an international school started appearing
 isse pehle ki ham skool ko kuch or tatolte, saamne kii sidhiyon se hansate-muskuraate virendra sahvaag hamaari ore badhate nazar aae
 First the glow on the face and the same warmth
 virendra sahvaag kahin or hote to shaayad baat cricket se hi shuru hoti
 But at the moment, school talk started
 baatcheet karte hue or building ke galiyaaron se hote hue ham students ke bich ja pahunche
 The science class was going on and the principal of the school itself was making the children practical
 viru ek sachche student kii tarah sab kuch bade dhyaan se sunne lage
 He told us, 'sports are not only taught in our school but also pay full attention to education
 yahaan scientificli dijind claces hai, jahaan padhai ke nae tareeke izaad kiye jate hai
 'out of the lab and where the little children reached there, they were preparing for a function
 in bacchon main se zyaadaatar nahin jaanate the ki viru koun hai, isliye unki practice main kahin koi baadha nahin thi
 After staring at the children for a long time, Veeru said, 'we tell these children everything of national importance, such as what is meant by October 2, August 15 and January 26
 dance or masti ke maahaul main chote bachche jaldi sikhte hai
 The way Sehwag was telling us about school and education, it was difficult to believe that he is the same batsman who bypassed all the cricketing shots and created his own definition
 viru ke mutabik unka makasad vyaktitv se zyada, bacchon kaa kairactor bananaa he
 He says that children make personality in college but character can be made in school itself
 viru ke skool kii shaayad yahi khubiyaan hai ki unka skool haryana kaa number-1 skool ban chukaa he
 The conversation about studies was enough, now it was the turn of Veeru's favorite subject game
 unke skool main cricket, footbal, basketbaal, squash, tennis, teble-tennis, swimming, badminton, kushti sabhi ke liye antarrashtriya str kii suvidhaayen maujuud he
 Veeru believes that a child should play all sports so that all his muscles are strengthened which is very important to become a player
 unke saath ham cricket maidan par bad chale
 At first glance, it was seen as a venue of international cricket
 bachche apane coach ke saath kaiching practice main jute the
 Veeru also got restless after seeing the bat and started giving batting tips to the children
 is maidan ke bare main bataate hue sahvaag ne kaha, 'hamane ye maidan firozshah kotla kii tarj par banaaya he
 The curators were also called from there to make the pitch
 haryana cricket association is maidan par under-16 or under-19 ke match yojit karaata he
 Yes, we cannot have a Ranji match here right now because there is a danger of losing the ball due to the surrounding greenery
 'baat cricket kii chali to hamane poocha ki team india main vaapasi kii taiyaari chal rahi he yaa coach banane kii ichha rakhte hai, jawaab viru ne apane hi andaaz main diya, 'agar main coach bana to pataa nahin kaise khilaadi paidaa honge, behatar he main cricket kheltaa rahun
 i want to play cricket for 2-3 years now
 gharelu cricket main ran banaakar team main vaapasi karnaa chahta hum
 The IPL is about to come and before that there is domestic one-day cricket
 meri koshish he zyaada se zyaada ran banaakar team india main vaapasi karun
 It was a great experience to see this eco-friendly school of Veeru in 23 acres
 shaam dhalane lagi thi or hamaare lautne kaa vakt bhi ho chalaa tha
 But on the go, we asked Veeru a question on his future as well
 hamane poocha ki kya sachin, ajahar or siddhu kii tarah viru bhi rajnatik pari khilne main ruchi rakhte hai? jawaab ek dam sidhe bat se aayaa, 'aapako lagata he ki main kabhi MP yaa MLA ban paaungaa, shaayad nahin kyonki main ek street forward aadmi hum
 Will play for 2-3 more years, then think about it ' bihar main bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane ke baad se hi jediu main halchal machi hui he

 Ultimately, a greater responsibility was placed on Rahul Gandhi's shoulder
 rahul gandhi ko party kaa upaadhyaksh bana diya gaya he
 The decision was taken at a meeting of the Congress Working Committee
 rahul gandhi ko upaadhyaksh banaae jane kii ghoshnaa se pehle hi jaipur main jashn kii taiyaariyaan shuru ho chuki thim
 The chariots were decorated, drums were arranged
 pichley do dinon main bujurg se lekar yuva netaaon kii fouj ne khulkar rahul raag alapa
 Everyone said in unison - Bring Rahul, make him PM in 2014
 nehru-gandhi parivaar ke vaaris rahul gandhi jab se siyaasi maidan main utre hai, tabhi se unhen congress kaa bhavishya mana gaya
 The 2009 election victory increased Rahul Gandhi's stature
 iske baad bihar, uttar pradesh, punjab or gujarat jaise ahm rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hue, lekin rahul kaa jaadu feekaa najar aayaa
 Rahul looked very aggressive in the Uttar Pradesh elections, but if the result came, it was proved that only Tvar does not get votes
 darasal, congress ko lag rahaa he ki rahul kii aguwai main yuvaaon kii badi taadaad congress se judegi lekin congress ke youth raag par main bijepi koi kuch doosraa agenda najar aa rahaa he
 In fact, Rahul was like aces for the Congress till now, which the party pulled out on every important occasion and now it became the same trump of the Congress but the question is whether Rahul will be able to stall the opposition in the electoral arena
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) agle kuch mahinomen hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke liye jald hi apane ummidavaaron kaa chayan kar sakati he
 For this, the party has also called a meeting on 29 September
 kaha ja rahaa he ki piem modi ke videshse lautate hi party apane sheersh netaaon ke saath baithkar ummidavaaron ke naam par manthan karegi
 Please tell that in the next one to one and a half months, by-elections are to be held in 66 assembly seats across Maharashtra and Haryana
 bijepi mukhyalay main hone vaali baithak main piem modi or grahamantri amit shah samet party ke varisht netaa shaamil honge
 According to sources, the party may also take many new decisions in the meeting to be held at the party headquarters
 aisa bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki party is chunaav main puraane vidhayakon kaa tikat kaat sakati he, saath hi kisi parivaar se ek hi vidhansabha yaa sansad bhejne kaa niyam banaaya ja saktaa he
 However, this rule will not apply to the existing legislators
 jaise purv kendriya mantri choudhary virendra singh khud rajya sabha main hai
 His sons are Lok Sabha mps and wife mlas
 choudhary virendra singh rajya sabha se istipha de chuke hai lekin abhi party ne unke istife ko aage sabhapati ke paas nahin badhaayaa he
 According to information received from the sources, MLA of independent parties supporting BJP in Haryana can also get ticket
 party kaa sheersh netritv is baar congress va anya party se aae netaaon ko bhi tikat de sakati he
 Significantly, the Election Commission had announced a few days ago that the Election Commission had announced that by-elections in 64 assembly seats in 17 states and one union territory will be held on October 21 and the results will be declared on October 24

 The names of Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav, chief general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav and national general secretary Azam Khan have been included in this list, but the name of the party's founder Mulayam Singh Yadav is missing from this list
 yani mulaayam singh yadav mainpuri se loksabhaa chunaav to sapa ke tikat par ladenge, lekin bataur star prachaarak samaajawaadee party ke liye vot kii apil karne kaa mauka unhen nahin diya gaya he
 This list of 40 star campaigners has been released from Samajwadi Party's Delhi office, the first name of which is Akhilesh Yadav
 akhilesh ke alaava ramgopal yadav, ajam khan, jaya bachchan, dimple yadav, rajendra choudhary, ramgovind choudhary, ahamed hasan, javed ali khan, vishmbhar prasad nishad, surendra nagar, tej pratap yadav, naresh uttam patel, moulana yaccin ali osmani, manoj paras, mehboob ali or shahid manjuur samet kamaal akhtar or aashu malik ko bhi star prachaarkon kii list main rakhaa gaya he
 But Mulayam Singh Yadav, the head of the socialist family, has not found a place in this list
 haalanki, unki seat par basapa supremeo mayawati bhi prachaar karne pahunchengi
 The SP-BSP and RLD, which are contesting elections together in UP, are also going to do joint campaigning
 tay kaarykram ke tahat teenon dalon ke netaa milakar upi main kul 11 reliyaan karenge, jisaki shuruyaat 7 april ko pashchim upi ke devband se hogi
 After this, on April 19, the SP-BSP and RLD veteran Mulayam Singh Yadav will arrive in Mainpuri to campaign
 yah mauka aitihaasik hoga, kyonki ek-duusare ke dhur virdohi maane jane vaale netaa ek manch par najar aaenge
 However, the SP is dominant in Mainpuri, in such a rally here, more than Mulayam Singh's demand for votes will have to convey the message of solidarity of SP-BSP-RLD in the entire state
 lekin jis samaajawaadee party ko mulaayam singh yadav ne upi ke kone-kone tak pahunchaaya he, uske star prachaarkon kii suchi main naam na hona bhi kai sawaal khadey karata he

 soramandal kaa hissaa hamaari dharti bhi he
 It is the third planet from the Sun
 hamaari prithvi ke chaaron taraf chandramaa ghumta he
 The Moon is the Earth's satellite and it orbits the Earth in an elliptical orbit
 prithvi, suraj or chandramaa kii gatiyon kii vajah se grahan padhate hai
 It is a simple game of shadow that occurs in the solar system
 chandra grahan kyon hota he?iskaa sidhaa sa jawaab he ki chandramaa kaa prithvi kii oot main aa janaa
 In that case the Sun is on one side, the Moon on the other side and the Earth in the middle
 jab chandramaa dharti kii chaaya se nikalataa he to chandra grahan padataa he
 The lunar eclipse falls on the full moon day, the lunar eclipse falls on the full moon day, but not every full moon has a lunar eclipse
 iskaa kaaran he ki prithvi kii kaksha par chandramaa kii kaksha kaa jhuke hona
 This inclination is about 5 degrees so each time the moon does not enter the Earth's shadow
 uske upar yaa neeche se nikal jaataa he
 The same is true for solar eclipse
 surya grahan hameshaa amavasya ke din hote hai kyonki chandramaa kaa aakaar prithvi ke aakaar ke mukaable lagbhag 4 guna kam he
 Its shadow falls on the small car on Earth, so in the state of perfection, the solar eclipse can be seen only from a small part of the earth
 lekin chandra grahan kii sthiti main dharti kii chaaya chandramaa ke mukaable kaaphi badi hoti he
 So it takes more time for the moon to pass through it
 bharat main aadhi raat ko dikhegaa chandragrahanchandra grahan puri duniya main ek saath hi shuru hota he or ek saath hi khatm hota he lekin yah is baat par nirbhar he ki vahaan par raatri kaa koun sa samay chal rahaa he
 Somewhere in the evening, it will be seen during or after the moonrise, and somewhere in the morning it will be around the moon, but in India, the lunar eclipse is starting here in the middle of the night
 lihaaja desh ke sabhi sthanon par yah ek saath shuru hoga or ek saath hi khatm hoga
