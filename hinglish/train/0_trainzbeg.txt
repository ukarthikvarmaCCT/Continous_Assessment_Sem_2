 Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal said that if any decision to increase the salary will be taken, it will be taken by the committee of the Assembly

 For the first time in the history of 86 years, BCCI, the largest institution of cricket has published its annual report on the photo cover of politicians
 raashtrapati kii tasviir cricketer sachin tendulkar ko bharat ratna dete hue chhaapi gai he jabaki piem narendra modi ko shapath lete hue dikhaaya gaya he
 Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister on 26 May and was the President of Gujarat Cricket Association at that time

 unhone yah bhi likhaa he ki board ke manje hue prashaasak shri arun jetali ji ko raksha or vitt mantri jaise mahatvapurn pad milane par hamen khushi hui he
 The BCCI has seen many ways of publishing the picture of politicians rather than cricketers

 He says that in this way the board is trying to get relief in many cases

 His cases are also going on in the High Court and Supreme Court
 bisisiai ke purv koshadhyaksh kishor rungata ne kaha ki isse na to modi ji ko fark padataa he or na hi jetali ji ko
 BCCI will also not benefit from this

 Ayodhya's Ram Mandir and Babri Masjid controversy have changed the state and direction of Indian politics forever
 6 disambar, 1992 ko ram mandir ke nirmaan ke liye desh bhar se karsevak ayodhya pahunche the or babari masjid ko tod diya tha
 The Babri demolition today completes 26 years
 ram mandir andolan se bijepi ko ek alag chamak bhi mili thi
 The result of this movement was that in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections, the 9-year-old BJP had risen to 85 from 2 seats
 lekin bijepi ke wo chehre jinhone is andolan ko dhar di thi or ve 1992 main babari vidhwans main party ke liye nayak bane the, unamem se zyaadaatar chehre aaj nepathy main hai
 The prominent faces of the BJP that have given this movement the accused of Babri demolition are LK Advani, Kalyan Singh, Murali Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar and Ram Vilas Vedanti
 bijepi ne 1989 ke palampur adhiveshan main ram mandir andolan ko chalaane kaa faisla kiya tha
 Ashok Singhal of VHP, Sadhvi Ritambhara, Acharya Dharmendra, BL Sharma Giriraj Kishore and Vishnu Hari Dalmia
 inamen se ashok singhl or giriraaj kishor ab is duniya main nahin hai

 adwani sabase bada cheharaaraam mandir ke paksh desh main maahaul banane ke liye adwani ne 1990 main somnath se ayodhya ke liye rath yatra nikaali
 The Ayodhya movement gained an edge through this journey
 desh ke kai shaharon or gaanvon se log ayodhya main karaseva karne ke liye pahunch rahe the
 In many parts of the country including Ayodhya, the slogan of 'ram Lala Hum Aayege, Mandir will be built there' was echoed
 adwani ayodhya andolan se bijepi ke sabase bade hindutv kaa cheharaa ban gaye the
 Advani was present in Ayodhya during the Babri demolition
 babari vidhwans ke liye ve shadyantr ke aaropee hai or maamla court main hai
 LK Advani's BJP is in power in the country, but today he is in the BJP guiding board
 kalyaan ne mandir ke naam sarkaar ko kiya tha qurbanadwani ke baad ayodhya andolan ke duusare sabase bada chehre ke taur par kalyaan singh kaa naam aata he
 In fact, Kalyan Singh was the Chief Minister of UP on 6 December 1992 at the Babri demolition in Ayodhya
 jabaki unhone sarvocch nyaayalay main shapath patr dekar kaha tha ki uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke rup main, vah masjid ko koi nuksaan nahin hone denge
 Despite this, the Karsevaks were breaking the mosque and the administration was watching the spectacle as a silent spectator
 duusare din centre sarkaar ne upi kii kalyaan sarkaar ko barkhaast kar diya
 Kalyan Singh said at that time that this government was formed in the name of Ram Mandir and its purpose was fulfilled

 Katiyar was considered the face of staunch Hindutva
 babari vidhwans ke dauraan vinay katiyaar ayodhya main maujuud the or wo is maamle main aaropee hai
 Katiyar has been accused of inciting karsevaks to break the Babri Masjid
 wo maujuuda samay main bijepi ke mahaj sadsy hai or na party main unki bhoomika he or na hi sarkaar main
 Ram Vilas Vedanti's name also comes as the face of Sasandayodhya movement, who has become a monk of Ayodhya
 ayodhya ke bade saadhuon main naam aata he
 Ram Mandir Adolan gave political identity to Vedanti and he became a BJP MP
 maujuuda samay main ram mandir nirmaan ke paksh main maahaul banane main jute he, lekin bijepi or sarkaar main haashiye par hai
 Apart from this, Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia was also present in Ayodhya during the Babri demolition, but she has passed away
 iske alaava swami chinmayanand bhi ayodhya andolan ke bade chehre the, lekin maujuuda samay main bijepi or saraakar- donon main koi bhoomika nahin he

 Nobody thought that the first match of the World T20 between the two countries would be a tie
 tab niyam tha ki yadi match taai rahata tha to faisla ‘ball out’ se hoga
 "we practiced it before the match where Robin Uthappa, Harbhajan Singh and i hit the stumps most often

 The comments unhone kaha, yah har tarah se mere liye april phool kaa din tha
 It was my first match and i was dismissed for one run, but during this match i came to know the stress of the match between India and Pakistan for the first time in my career

 unhone kaha, maine unke kuch khilaadiyon ke liye apshabd kahe lekin seemaa nahin langhi kyonki ham bhartiya apane pratidwandviyon kaa sammaan karte hai or chhintakashi or apshabd kehane ke bajaay khilne par adhik dhyaan dete hai

 co / gkkghqvslj lambey intjaar ke baad aakhirkaar 30 november ko didie awasaiya yojana kaa dra nikaala jayega
 There are 12 thousand flats under this scheme
 didie kii taraf se drow kii sabhi taiyaariyaan puri kar lee gayi hai lekin yahaan ye jaan lenaa jaruri he ki 12 hajaar flaton main se lagbhag 11 hajaar eliji flats hai, jinhen pehle edablyooes ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 These flats were also included in the housing scheme of 2014, but due to their reduced area, people refused to take them
 didie bhale hi nae awasaiya yojana ke bade gungan kar ke bech rahaa he par sachai ye he ki kareeb 11 hajaar vahi puraane makaan hai jinke khasta haalat ke chalate 2014 main logo ne le kar chhod diya tha
 Given this, the DDA has no way to return these flats this time
 yani agar aapane form bhar diya he or agar aapako flats mil jaataa he tab aapako flats aapako khareednaa hi hoga nahi to aapkaa dipasit jabt kar liya jayega
 The condition of dda's LIG flats is disastrous among all the flats covered under the housing scheme of khastadda
 2014 main jin logon ne flats liye the wo aaj bhi ro rahe hai
 The DDA has built the house and given it, but after that, God is trusting and maintaining them

 Manoj, who has been living here with his family since 2011, says, 'the day has come, we are worried, something still remains, the DDA had taken from us 76 thousand mentions and said 2 years, 3 years and 5 Will repair after year but not even once till date

 'ghat rahi he aavedakon kii sankhyis awasaiya yojana main 12 hajaar flaton ke liye lagbhag 42 hajaar logon ne aavedan kiya he
 While more than 10 lakh forms were submitted in the housing scheme of 2014, only 42 thousand forms in the 2017 housing scheme are enough to show disgust towards the dda's housing schemes of the people
 is eliji flats ke liye lagbhag 20 hajaar logon ne aavedan kiya he
 This time, every other person applying for LIG is set to get a flat
 lekin sawaal yah he ki pehle hi makaan kharid kar ro rahe logon kii samasyaon se munh mode chuki didie nai yojanaon ke liye kiye vaayade kaise puure kar paaegi?

 He said that the government had given a statement on Friday that removing the name of the former Prime Minister from the ECL was just a formality
 unhone kaha, 'ham chakit hai ki pradhanmantri imran khan ke aashwaasan tathaa unke salaahkaar or videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ke sakaaratmak bayanon ke baavjood navaj sharif kaa naam isiel se nahin hataa, jisase pataa chalata he ki is sambandh main jarur koi samasya he

 unhone don news ko bataaya, 'navaj sharif kii tabiyat bahut najuk he or unki haalat platelets kii asthirataa ke kaaran lagaataar bigadati ja rahi he

 lekin ab isane yah pataa lagane kii koshish kii ki chand computer kii strokes se kaise yugers ko khush yaa naaraaz kiya ja saktaa he

 aap jaanakar chaunk jaaenge ki fasebuk kholane par aapako kya dikhegaa or kya nahin, ise pichley dinon control kiya ja rahaa tha
 No one else, Facebook itself was tampering with your news feed without permission
 neshnal academy of sciences ke ek research paper main daawa kiya gaya he ki fasebuk ne apane ek prayog ke liye kareeb 7 lakh se zyada yugers kii news feed main tabdiliyaan kin
 Actually, Facebook wanted to see the impact of positive and negative posts on users, so some posts were hidden from users and more were shown
 research paper ke mutabik, 6,89,003 yugers ke saath yah prayog kiya gaya or unki news feed main raddobadal kiye gaye
 Is this action of Facebook justified? Users are divided into two groups
 ek group ko dikhne vaale 'negative imotional post' kii sankhya gata di gai or duusare ko dikhne vaali 'positive imotional posts' kam kar di gayi
 Facebook then monitored whether this affected the behavior of the user
 dilachasp baat yah he ki iskaa asar dekha bhi gaya
 Most people who saw negative posts mostly posted 'negative emotional'
 asal myanon main fasebuk ne 'yugers kya dekhegaa', yah nahin badla
 She selected posts for your viewing using an algorithm
 iskaa istemaal 'yujar kaa bihaviour' badalane ke shaktishaalee tul ke taur par kiya gaya
 However, it has been reported in the research paper that such 'manipulation' has been mentioned by Facebook in its terms of use

 The rupee is crying standing in the world market
 rupaya baha rahaa he mudra bazaar main apni lagaataar girti saakh ke aansu
 This decline has continued for the past several months
 somvaar ko haalat ye thi ki dollar ke mukaable rupaya 61 se bhi zyada tak gir gaya
 The fall of the rupee is not just a game of statistics, but the tears of the weeping rupee will have all-round effect
 haalat ye ho gai he, ki apane hi bazaar apni saakh kaa ronaa ro rahaa he rupaya kyonki dollar ke mukaable lagaataar girte bhav kii vajah se kaarobaari bhi rupee se munh modane lage hai
 The dollar may not have been gold like the dollar against the rupee
 rupee ke aansu sirf kaagaj ke is tukade tak simit rahete, to koi baat hoti
 Everyone knows that the business of the entire country rests on this rupee, so the market is crying out after rupee, the common man is scared and scared
 haalanki bahut kam logon samaj pate hai, ki ye dollar hamaare rupee kii keemat kyon tay karata he
 What does it mean for the rupee to fall against the dollar? to ise aasaan bhashaa main kuch yun samajha ja saktaa he
 Why the value of rupee falls? The main reason for falling rupee is the lack of dollar in the country's treasury
 ab sawaal yah he ki dollar kii kami kyon hoti he, to isaki vajah he aayaat main badhottaree
 Because the more imports increase, the more the dollar cost will increase
 desh ke kul aayaat kaa bada hissaa kharch hota he kachche tel kii kharidari par
 In the international market, dollar spending keeps increasing as crude oil prices rise
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki desh main dollar kii kami kii vajah sirf kachche tel ke daamon main badhottaree he
 There are other reasons for this, which the government can control, but even after crossing the record rate of 61 rupees per dollar, the government is still asleep
 pichley ek maheene main rupaya har roj giravat kaa nayaa ricard bana rahaa he
 But from the Finance Minister to the Prime Minister, we are heard saying that there is no need to panic
 jabaki jaanakaron kii maane to rupee ke daam main giravat kaa yahi haal rahaa to, na sirf kaarobaar prabhavit hoga, balki aam aadmi kaa jeena bhi muhaal ho jayega
 That is, as the cry of the rupee increases, the common man's problems will increase
 sabase pehle to bhartiya tel companiyaan mahange hote dollar kii vajah se petrol, dijal or gas kii keemten badhaane kaa dabaav banaati he
 If this happens, the price of other things is badly affected
 yani rupee ke aansuon ke saath mahangaai or aasmaan chune lagegi
 How will rupee stop? * Exports have to be boosted against imports
 *lambey samay se atake enarai bonds ko manjuuri deni hogi
 * Non-trade payments abroad will have to be curbed
 *videsh main rakhaa gaya paisa waapas mangane kaa aadesh bhi kargar ho saktaa he
 * Reserve Bank will have to direct dollar funding on purchase of crude oil
 is disha main sarkaar kii koshish sirf ek hi dikhti he, sone ke aayaat par custom duty badhanaa
 FDI could also be another effective way to increase dollar reserves, but this too hangs in the balance after opposition opposition
 aise main ye ashanka bevajaah nahin ki aane vaale samay main bhartiya rupaya or kamjor ho saktaa he

 aankadon ke mutabik, jin 119 logon par maamla darj kiya gaya he, unamem se 12 log sarkari karmchaaree hai
 a departmental investigation is sitting on 29 people
 logon par kai tarah kii dhaaraon ke tahat karrwai kii ja rahi he
 a 45-year-old man was arrested in 2018 because he shared a picture with the caption 'ilam Shariakum' for allegedly defaming CM Pinarayi Vijayan
 yah ek chunavi naaraa tha jiskaa prayog left dwaara paaramparik taur par kiya jaataa tha
 In another case, a case was registered against a man for allegedly making objectionable remarks against the CM and his family background
 shaks par public kshetra main ashleel gaanaa gane kaa aarope tha
 On these matters MK Munir said, 'there is no difference between Pinarayi Vijayan and CM Yogi Adityanath
 agar vijayan ke khilaaf koi tippanee yaa aalochana karata he to use police kii karrwai kaa saamana karnaa padataa he lekin vipaksh ke dwaara kii gai shikaayat par koi karrwai nahin hoti
 However, sources in the Left Front claimed that the case was registered on the basis of the public complaint and it does not include the CM
 vijay rupani gujarat ke nae mukhyamantri honge
 Since Anandiben Patel's resignation, the bjp's stand on the new Chief Minister of Gujarat has been resolved
 shuukravaar shaam gandhinagar bijepi daftar main party ke vidhayak dal kii baithak ke baad rupani ke naam kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 With this, Nitin Patel, who is considered to be the frontrunner in cm's race so far, will be made deputy CM
 rupani ravivaar ko shapath grahan karenge
 Such a thing was also attended by the National President Amit Shah, Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari and Anandiben Patel at the meeting of the BJP Legislature Party
 bataaya jaataa he ki siem ke naam ko lekar vidhayak dal kii baithak main anandiben or amit shah ke bich takaraar hui
 When Shah was adamant on making Rupani the CM, Anandi wanted to make Nitin his successor
 phir ve satish ne piem modi ko phone kiya or anandiben se unki baat karai gai
 Ultimately, the formula for making Vijay Rupani, considered close to Amit Shah, CM and Nitin Patel as deputy CM was agreed upon
 jo na kar sakin anandiben, wo karnaa hoga rupani kogujrat ke mukhyamantri kii gaddi par baithne ja rahe vijay rupani kii agali raah aasaan nahin hogi
 They have to do things that Anandiben could not do
 rupani ke liye sabase ahm kaamon main sushasan dena, sarkaar se naaraaz chal rahe patel or dalit samudaay ko shant karnaa or sarkaar-party ke bich sambandhon ko majboot bananaa shaamil hai
 The BJP desperately needed a face that could pacify the Patidars and Dalits for the post of Chief Minister
 lekin gaiyr-patidaar samudaay se aane kii vajah se rupani ke liye ye kaam aasaan nahin hoga
 Who is Vijay Rupani? After the resignation of Anandiben Patel, Vijay Rupani has been elected as the next Chief Minister of Gujarat
 gujarat bijepi ke adhyaksh vijay rupani kii sanghathan main acchhee pakad he
 Rupani is an MLA from Rajkot West
 unke paas gujarat sarkaar main parivahan, water supplai or lebar and employ jaise mantralay bhi hai
 a reliable face with experience, Rupani Anandiben's party's organization in the state was weakening after becoming the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 bijepi kii andruni uthapathak haikaman ke paas ja rahi thi
 This was the reason that Vijay Rupani was made president to strengthen the organization
 haalanki vijay rupani khud sarkaar main bhi parivahan mantri kii bhoomika main hai
 In such a situation, he also has experience of running the government for about a year
 shah ke kareebi bhi hai rupanivijay rupani kaa naam isliye bhi sab se upar liya ja rahaa tha ki wo amit shah ke karibiyon main se ek hai
 He is also coordinating the government and the organization very well
 yahaan tak ki pichley dinon sarkaar kii jitani bhi mahatvapurn yojanaayen ghoshit kii gayi, wo sabhi anandiben patel kii jagah vijay rupani ne hi kii
 However, experts are also assuming that the BJP may have to face the loss of Patidar votes in Gujarat if he is made the chief minister from the non-patidar community
 piem modi ke chahete hai pateldusri ore, dipti siem ke taur par chune gaye gujarat sarkaar main maujuuda swasthya mantrinitin patelpradhanmantri narendra modi ke chahete hai
 Nitin Patel was said to be the first choice after Narendra Modi's Anandiben Patel
 pichley dinon raajnneetik uthapatak ke baad anandiben patel ne soshal media ke jariye gujarat ke mukhyamantri pad se hatane kii ichha jaahir kii thi
 Patelnitin Patel is the most experienced minister in Gujarat government
 Today's political situation in Gujarat was said to be the best Chief Ministerial candidate
 sutron ke anusaar piem modi kii pasand nitin patel is liye bhi the ki wo vartmaan main gujarat sarkaar main sabase anbhavi or varisht mantri bhi hai
 The second thing that used to go in favor of Nitin Patel is that he has been a minister of all departments of Gujarat government from time to time
 vidhansabha chunaav par party kii najaranitin patel gujarat ke mehasanda jile ke rahane vaale hai or menhasanda patidaar andolan kaa garh he
 The party leadership also believed that making Nitin Patel the chief minister would weaken the Patidar movement
 party kaa ye bhi maananaa tha ki patel kii jagah kisi or jati ke netaa mukhyamantri banane se patidaar andolan ek baar phir se teji pakad legaa
 The video of the fight has gone viral
 An FIR has been lodged by both the parties
 a video of a hospital in Sambalpur, Odisha is going viral in which a doctor and relatives of a patient were assaulted

 vimes ke kuch medical chaatro ne do yuvakon ko pakad liya jab ve neurology vibhaag ke professor sooryakanth patjoshi ke saath chhedchhad karne ke baad bhaagane kii koshish kar rahe the
 He did so after the doctor reportedly refused to accompany him to a private nursing home

 Shatrughan Sinha, who has associated his dialogue "khamosh" in films with his identity, is probably not under political control
 tabhi to bihari babu, apni baat ho yaa apana dard khulkar or bebaaki se rakhte hai
 While talking to Aaj Tak, his political pain spilled over his tongue
 shatrughna sinha jab bole to khulkar bole yahaan tak bol gaye kilaalakrishna adwanika saath dene kii sajaa unhen party de rahi, lekin vah laalkrishna adwani ke saath khadey rahenge or iske liye unhen koi bhi sajaa kubul he
 Shatrughan Sinha's biggest accusation is that the party and all the big leaders are being accused because they supported LK Advani and continued to stand for him
 bihari babu ne kaha
 "if we are punished because of Advani's camp or because of public concern about it, then it is a confession
 ''shatrughna sinhane adwani ko raashtrapati nahin banane par bhi apni aapatti khulkar jataai, sinha ne kaha " laalkrishna adwani ko raashtrapati banane ke liye poocha tak nahin gaya
 Everyone hoped that Advani would be made president but what happened, why he was not asked
 "party ke bheetar bolne kii aazaadee nahimbihari babu ne bijepi par bada aarope jadaa or kaha party bolne kaa forum nahin diya jaataa isi vajah he party main jab placeform nahin miltaa to ham media ke jariye apni baat rakh rahaa hum
 When the party forum is not available, the only way is the media, where i will put my point
 'ab main mukt hum'bihari babu ke bheetar itnaa dard bharaa he ki ab khud ko party se mukt maanane lage hai

 Bihari Babu was not in his desire to serve as a minister, even the pain of not becoming a minister was gone and he said, what else could be the reason
 kya meraa parformens kharaab tha, kya koi bhrashtachar kaa aarope he, aakhir kya kaaran he
 Like Tiso who was made a minister and I, Arun Shourie or Yeswant Sinha were not made
 kya vajah he ki arun shouri jaise logon ko tallent pool tak main shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 "the PM did not give time
 Sinha said," We and Yeswant Sinha asked the PM for an appointment, but could not be found
 abhi haal main main piem se milane ke liye vakt maanga lekin kaha gaya motaseth yani rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah se mil le
 He felt that we are asking for time to become a minister
 mujhe mantri nahin bananaa lekin wo nahin mili
 Why brother? We did not ask for time to become a minister but to give feedback
 party se naaraazgi par bolepahali baat party se main naaraaz nahin hum, party se prem he, us vakt shaamil hua jab do saansad the
 Now it is a matter of displeasure, so it is a privilege that people now say angry
 jo bhi sach bole use naaraaz ke braket main daal diya jaataa he
 Why should i be angry i want the party to move forward, but i speak because of some people and leaders of the party
 kyonki mujhe lagata he party ke sabhi faisle sahi nahin he
 Bihari Babu slammed the party on demonetisation and GST, Shatrughan Sinha said "if the government's decision was all right then why would it be rolling in GDP
" jab ham sabane kaha notebandi dizaster he, notebandi kii vajah se log kii naukariyaan gai hai
 Everyone said, the Reserve Bank said, Manmohan Singh said that four lakh jobs have been lost due to demonetisation
 ham sab ne kaha tha or ab to jiesti neem ke upar karela jaisaa he
 Bihari Babu also gives himself the credit for changing the decision on GST again, he says that the credit goes to all of us, but what will happen with the credit, now i have come a long time, please come
 ab log kah rahe hai ki ye sab drama he aap chunaav ke samay par gst main raahat kaa elaan kar rahe hai
 Speaking on Star Campaigner, Bihari Babu said that i have been the best and biggest star campaigner of UP ever
 lekin mujhe municipal chunaav tak main campaner nahin banaaya gaya
 At the party, One Man Show and Two Man Army Habihari Babu said that when i say One Man Show and Two Man Army Hai, i am giving feedback that the courtiers, government and spoon should not work
 jaraa hamen bhi sune, hame taqalif hoti he jab log kehete hai ki aapaki party van main sho or tu main army he
 On Rahul said, you cannot take Rahul Gandhi lightly in the Gujarat elections, do not consider the opposition weak, Hanuman set fire to Lanka
 gujarat chunaav bijepi ke liye chunaav nahin chunauti hoga
 2019 is difficult but still not impossible
 lekin iske liye sabhi naaraaz logon ko ekasaath lenaa padegaa
 Shatrughan Sinha praised the Congress and said that who gave IIT IIM, is all development going on today
 nehru se lekar indira tak sabane vikaas kiya he
 Government should say sorry in demonetisation
 agar notebandi sahi hota to janata jashn manaa rahi hoti na kii sarkaar
 Shatrughan Sinha said that he has the right to act on me
 agar unhen lagata he ki maine galat kiya he to wo faisla lene ko swatantra hai

 That is, the rally crowd has its own meaning
 aise main agar kisi raily main bheed na jute paae to vah na sirf khabar ban jaati he, balki virdohi dal use mudda bhi banane lagate hai
 One such incident has happened with actor Anupam Kher

 unhone kaha ki jo kal kii raily bheed na hone ke chalate radd hone kii baat kar rahe the, unhen aaj kii yah tasviir dikhaani chahie

 New Zealand have 41 matches in favor while 1 match is inconclusive, 5 matches tie
 lekin team india kaa ek bada lakshya isisi ranking main kiwi team ko chit kar tisare number par pahunchnaa bhi he
 
 
 For this goal, India will need to win the Kiwi team by a margin of 4-1 or 3 matches

 2019 ke liye sabhi partiyon ne qamar kas lee he
 All the opposition parties have come together to prevent the Modi government from coming back to power
 centre sarkaar ke 4 saal puure hone par ek survey main desh kaa mood bhaanpane kii koshish kii gai he
 According to this survey, the Modi government will wave again in 2019, but this time the lotus blossom will not be as easy as 2014
 rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata main ijafaebipi news-lokaneeti-siesds ke is survey ke mutabik modi aaj bhi sabase lokapriy netaa hai
 But the special thing is that Rahul Gandhi's popularity has increased
 ye survey 28 april 2018 se 17 may 2018 ke bich 19 rajyon main 15859 logon se baatcheet ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 According to the survey, if elections are held today on 543 Lok Sabha seats, NDA may get 274 seats, UPA 164 and others 105 seats
 agar 2014 se isaki tulana karen to endie ko 49 siton kaa nuksaan hota dikh rahaa, vahiin upie is baar bade phaayde main he
 UPA may get 104 more seats in the event of elections
 anya dalon ko 48 siton kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Companion with colleagues is not optional, this time it is clear in the mathematics of compulsory seats that this time it is difficult for BJP to form government on its own
 dilli kii kursi par baithna he to is baar bijepi ke liye sahyogiyon kaa saath aichhik na hokar anivaary ho saktaa he
 In terms of vote percentage, this time NDA is expected to get 37%, UPA 31% and other parties 32%
 uttar, pashchim or madhya bharat main bijepi ko apekshaakrit kam vot mil sakate hai
 The way all the major opposition parties in Karnataka have joined hands to stop the victory chariot of the BJP, if the opposition parties join hands, it will be a bit difficult for the BJP if all the opposition parties remain together in the political arena of 2019
 
 haalanki phir bhi satta se unhen dur nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In UP, the NDA may get 8 per cent less votes if there is a grand alliance in the Rangatupi, showing akhilesh-mayawati compatible
 yani 2014 main mila 43 fisadi vot girakar 35 fisadi par simat jayega
 If Akhilesh and Mayawati contest elections in UP, they will get 4 percent more votes
 survey ke mutabik upie ko 12% or anya (espi-bispi-anya dal) ko kareeb 53% vot mil sakate hai
 In Rajasthan too, the loss of 10 percent of the votes, the alliance can increase the trouble for BJP not only in UP but also in other states
 rajasthan main bhi endie ko 10 fisadi vot share kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 In 2014, 55 per cent of the votes polled can be 45 per cent
 vahiin upie phaayde main rah sakati he
 This time the UPA can get a total of 30 percent of the vote with a 12 percent increase
 purvi bharat main bijepi ko phaaydasrvey main bijepi ko purvi bharat kii 142 siton main 90 se zyada siten milane kaa anumaan he
 The UPA is looking weak here
 upie ko purvottar se sirf 22-26 jabaki anya 26-30 seat paa sakate hai
 That is, when compared to 2014, this time the BJP is stronger than before
 bijepi ko is baar 32 siten adhik mil sakati hai
 Nitish Kumar's coming with NDA in Bihar also seems to be a profitable deal for BJP
 bengal main bijepi ko badhat par ‘didi’ se pichepaschim bengal kii baat karen to yahaan endie ko is baar 24 pratishat, upie ko 11 or anya ko 65 fisadi vot mil sakate hai
 The NDA got only 17 percent of the votes in 2014
 yahaan aaj bhi sattadhari dal tiemasi sabase badi party he
 NDA may get more than 70 seats out of 118 seats in West and Central India
 upie 41 se 47 seat paati dikh rahi he
 This time the BJP may suffer more from Madhya Pradesh
 yahaan 2014 ke mukaable party ko 14 pratishat vot kam mil saktaa he
 There may also be a loss in Gujarat: In the survey of PM Modi, in the state of Gujarat, 54 percent votes are visible in the NDA account and 42 percent in the UPA account
 2014 main gujarat main bijepi gathbandhan ko 59% vot mili the, jabaki congress gathbandhan ko 33% vot mili the
 This time BJP can get 5 percent less votes from here
 iskaa sidhaa phayda congress ko milegaa, jiskaa vot pratishat 9% bad saktaa he
 In South India, the UPA will be benefited, if you talk about South India, then the NDA can be lost in 132 seats in 6 states
 chunaav kii surat main endie ko sirf 18 se 22, upie ko 65 se 75 or anya ko 38 se 44 siten milane kii sambhaavna he
 In the last election, NDA got 23 seats, UPA 21 and others 88 seats

 haalanki sutron ke mutabik modi ko esaiti kii report main raahat mili he
 The report said that the SIT has not found any evidence against Modi regarding the riots, Zakia Jafreen had filed a complaint against the Chief Minister and 62 others
 media kii in khabaron kii aadhikarik pushti nahin hui he
 No SIT official has been commented on this matter

 esaiti kaa gathan bhi nyaayalay ne kiya tha
 Now the magistrate will consider this report
 yah report us din saunpi gai he, jab gujarat ucch nyaayalay nenarendra modisarkaar ko dangon ke dauraan ‘niskriyata or laaparvaahee’ ke liye fatkaar lagaai
 The High Court said that the situation had become 'chaotic' due to the inaction and negligence of the state government at that time and the situation had been maintained for several days

 The entire country was shaken by the death of 11 people of the same family in that house in Burari
 jaanch main khulaasa hua tha ki puure parivaar ne kisi aatma, andhvishwaas or tantra-mantra ke chakkar main ye khaufnak kadam uthaaya tha
 After this incident, he became 'ill-fated' for the people of the house
 koi us ghar main rahane kii dur, paas se guzarane kii bhi nahin sochataa
 But two brothers from UP started living in that house
 is baat se ilaake ke log hairaan hai
 After the Burari incident, on 14 October last year, the house was given to two of his acquaintances by Dinesh, the only surviving member of the family, to live
 jab ve donon bhai is ghar main rahane aae to unhen padosiyon ne is ghar ke bare main kai daraavnee kahaniyaan sunai
 Many even tried to stop them from staying in that house
 lekin wo donon bhaaiyon ne thaan liya ki ve usee ghar main rahenge
 According to a daily report, two brothers named Ahmed Ali and Afsar Ali are staying in the house amid rumors of supernatural powers and unknown forces being in the house
 ye donon bhai mritkon ke parivaar ko kareeb 8 saal se jaanate hai
 Ahmed Ali, 30, says that if someone questions his decision, they ask the questioner if he had evacuated their homes after a death in their families
 wo bataate hai ki log unke is ghar main rahane par ajeeb pratikriya dete hai
 Dinesh Chundavat and his family lived in this house for two nights before the Ali brothers
 iske baad wo shift ho gaye the
 While the Ali brothers who came to live after them ignore most of the superstition
 jabaki aas-paas rahane waalon kaa maananaa he ki aadhi raat ko us ghar main 'atmaaen' nikalati hai
 Officer Ali explained that this is a widespread belief even in his village in Bareilly
 lekin vah apane shedul kii vajah se dinar karne ke baad aadhi raat ko chat par jaataa he
 Both brothers state that when they decided to go to Burari, their own family had also strongly opposed it
 kyonki unke gharavaale nahin chaahate the ki ve donon us manahuus ghar main rahen
 According to Ahmed, who spent several nights alone in this house, both of them told that they sometimes call their colleagues who work there
 magar aas-paas rahane vaale logon ko dur rakhte hai
 Because most of the people there just keep trying to scare them
 sabase hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki us ghar ko lekar abhi tak keval khaufnak or daraane vaali kahaniyaan hi afvaah ke taur par saamne aati thim
 But now the rumor of the house being sold is also spreading fast
 jaankaron ke mutabik us ghar kii keemat aaj sava karod se zyada he

 Legislators have been talking about dominating the MLA Dabi Juban in a fierce majority over the strong majority Trivendra Rawat government
 atakalein hai ki trivendra ravat ko pad par bane rahane ke liye shaayad apni kaaryastylee badalani pade
 After winning the assembly elections in 2017, Trivendra Singh Rawat of Thakur caste was made the Chief Minister but the party did not give importance to the Brahmin society in the government
 bhaajapa pradesh adhyaksh ajay bhatta se hi is samaaj ko santosh karnaa padaa
 An attempt has been made to appease the Brahmin class by making Nishank a cabinet minister
 nishank ke uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri rahane ke dauraan unhone pradesh ko green bonus die jane kii maang jor-shor se uthaai thi
 Now by becoming his Union Minister, this demand will be strengthened
 nishank ke maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri banane se uttarakhand kii ummiden bhi bad gai hai
 The condition of higher education in Uttarakhand is not good, now with Nishank becoming the education minister, hopes of improvement have been raised
 log rajya se baahar chale gaye enity ko phir se sthapit karne kii ummid jataa rahe hai
 The acute shortage of teachers in state universities will also be a challenge for them
 rajya ke vishvavidhyalay jaruri sansadhano ke liye jujh rahe hai
 After Nishank becomes the minister, there will be a change in these arrangements
 pichley dinon rajya main sthapit neshnal institute of technology (enity) kaa capus jaipur shift karnaa padaa tha
 The reason given was that Srinagar did not have the necessary arrangements to run the institute
 sthapana ke kai varshon baad bhi enity ko sthai building nahin mil pai thi
 Now there is a great hope that as Nishank Education Minister, he will make efforts to improve its systems
 gadhwal vishvavidhyalay, kumaun vishvavidhyalay, doon vishvavidhyalay jaise santhaan bhi unki taraf ab takataki lagaae dikhenge
 *** kuch shodhakartaaon ne aisi takanic ijad karne kaa daawa kiya he ki ghaas jaev-eendhan main parivartit hokar hawaii jahaaj ke eendhan ke rup main prayog main laai ja sakati he
 Kern Khor, a scientist at the University of Ghent in Belgium, said that till now the grass grown on the ground has been used as animal feed, but now the grass can also be used as a bio-fuel
 khor ne apni nirikshan vidhi main ghaas ke tukade-tukade kar tab tak iskaa pareekshan kiya, jab tak ki iseindhanke rup main prayog na kiya ja sake
 The grass was first tested to improve its biodegradability, then bacteria were taken into it, as the bacteria convert the sugar found in the grass to lactic acid and its derivatives
 lactic amla, ek teevr rasinic ke rup main baodigadrability plastic (piele) or eendhan jaise yogicon ko utpaadit karne main madad karata he
 Much work remains to be done to turn it into reality
 This lactic acid is later converted to caproic acid and further converted to decane
 iske baad iskaa upyog vayuyan ke eendhan ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Scientist Khor says that although this step is revolutionary, much more remains to be done to turn it into reality
 vah aage bataate hai ki abhi tak ghaas kii kuch maatra ko hi jaev-eendhan main badla ja saktaa he
 This recent system is quite expensive and machines should adopt this new system
 ghent vishvavidhyalay dwaara jari ek bayaan main vaigyanik khor ne kaha, 'yadi ham ashaavadi hai, to ham apane kaam ko vyavsaayik duniya ke sahyog se aage le ja sakate hai
 We can reduce the prices of this new technology a bit and it is possible that in a few years, we can all fly with the help of grass

 After coming into existence in the year 2000, Chhattisgarh has given separate decision in the assembly and Lok Sabha elections for the first time
 rajya main isse pehle teen baar vidhansabha chunaavon ke thik baad loksabhaa chunaav hue the jisamen matadaataaon ne bhaajapa ke prati loksabhaa main vishwaas jataayaa tha
 In 2004, 2009 and 2014, the party was given 10 Lok Sabha seats out of the total 11 of the state, while the Congress continued to get only one seat each time
 disambar 2018 main congress ne pradesh ke 18 saal ke itihaas main ab tak kaa sabase bada janadesh (rajya kii 90 siton main se 68) hasil kiya or use ummid thi ki loksabhaa chunaav main bhi badhat milegi
 But where did the Congress outperform? The biggest factor contributing to the bjp's victory was Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity
 isane krishi rin maafee, badi hui keemton par dhan kii kharid, rajya kii congress sarkaar kii nai naukariyon kii ghoshnaa jaise sabhi sthaneey muddon ko peeche chhod diya
 In the tribal areas of South Chhattisgarh, the Congress did better and lost Bastar and Kanker by small margins
 isane korba seat jiti, lekin uttari or madhya kshetra modi lahar main congress ke haath kuch nahin aayaa

 My first big story in national politics was the by-election in Allahabad in June 1988, when V, sparked by a revolt against Rajiv Gandhi
 pi
 Singh challenged him to the seat which was vacated by Amitabh Bachchan
 uske baad bhartiya raajnneeti kii disha badali or desh ke hindi hriday pradesh main congress ke vot bank kaa patan shuru hua
 But we are not uprooting the deadlines of this 27 year old story, a similar story is being repeated in Delhi now
 thik ve
 P
 singh kii hi tarah arvind kejariwal ek rashtriya party ko uski takat ke charam par chunauti de rahe hai, jisamen unka saath bhaanti-bhaanti ke samaajawaadee, rashtravaadi, pratirodhi or vam-lohian-udaar buddhijivi de rahe hai
 If Kejriwal wins this battle as it did in 1988 in Allahabad, then there is a whole gesture to disturb the recent new equilibrium in Indian politics
 unka muqabla yahaan unki chunavi pratidwandvi kiran bedi yaa phir bijepi tak se nahin he
 It is facing Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 bedi to usee tarah unki naayab hai jis tarah 1988 main elahabaad main sunil shastri rajeev gandhi ke the
 The way the BJP has now tried to use Bedi to remind voters that she too has been an activist like Kejriwal and has tried to convert it into a fight between two old political colleagues
 At the time, the Congress considered Sunil, son of Lal Bahadur Shastri, as a model of honesty and simplicity in politics
 pi
 Against Singh, whom Shastriji considered as his fifth son and who gave most of his ancestral property to Shastri's trust
 yahaan bhi makasad 'mul' banaam 'farji' kaa muqabla karana tha
 In both cases, the party with a large interference survived a direct confrontation between its supreme leader and the new party
 yah tarkeeb tab bhi kaamyaab nahin hui thi, is baar bhi nahin hogi
 i will not be so foolish as to predict the outcome even before 11 am on the day of counting, even if all the opinion polls say anything including that of an India Today group (which indicates your victory), but This much i can say that the first round has definitely gone to Kejriwal
 unhone lagbhag ek saal se modi kaa har kadam peechha kiya he, jiskaa dussahas rahul gandhi bhi kabhi nahin dikhaa paae
 He contested from Varanasi and finished second
 yah apane aap main ek sandesh tha ki congress kaa paaramparik bijepi-virdohi vot kejariwal ke paas ja rahaa tha
 Also, Muslim voters of Uttar Pradesh have an option other than Samajwadi Party
 isliye 10 farvari ko nateeja jo bhi rahe, unhone modi or bijepi ko dilli main pehle palken jhukaane ke liye to majaboor kar hi diya
 The country's strongest and most ideologically cadre-based national party had to change its commander weeks before the war and had to borrow a defection from the recent Anna movement to fight Kejriwal
 ham samaj sakate hai ki dilli main vishwaas main thodi kami kii vajah se bijepi ise modi banaam kejariwal kii ladaai banane se rokna chaahati thi
 But when the wind started to turn clear, he had no choice but to silence Modi with a full-blown attack
 cricket kii bhashaa main kaha jaae to yah aisa hi tha maano kam hoti roshni main apane mukhya ballebaaj ko bachaane ke liye din ke aakhri chaar over khilne ko kisi nite wochaman ko utaara jaae
 Then the night watchman gets out on the very first ball
 apane prachaar main or kisi baat kii bajaae kejariwal bijepi main is ghabrahat kaa tamaasha zyada khadaa kar de rahe hai
 This is the reason that the issue of some ridiculous funding is giving the same kind of fun to the supporters of AAP as the case of St
 Kitts
 pi
 Singh's supporters
 haalanki zyada badi samanta prachaar ke muddon, tareekon or pratikon main he
 V
 pi
 Singh led the fierce protest against corruption, Kejriwal also got the initial importance as an activist on the same issue
 unke abhiyaan ko bhi aresas ne khulkar samarthan diya jaise 1988 main ve
 P
 singh ko diya tha
 In both cases, the common motive was to topple a stable Congress government
 vah us samay bhi kaamyaab hua lekin jaldi hi ve
 P
 singh aresas / bijepi ke mukhya shatru ban gaye, jaise ab kejariwal ban gaye hai
 V
 pi
 Like Singh, he is also a master at playing
 ve
 P
 singh kaa sada-sa sir kaa kapadaa, doodh kaa flask or motorcical sab is jamini raajnneeti ke aujaar the
 Similarly, Kejriwal's un-shaped cap (I wish you had used Khadi instead of the non-biodegradable cap of waxed paper, now copied by BJP), is muffler and cough
 ve
 P
 singh ke ranneetikaron or prachaarkon main se kai prakhyat 'samaajawaadee' patrkaar or sampadak bhi the
 If there was live TV coverage at that time, then cartoonist and satirist Rajinder Puri would have been his Kumar Vishwas
 or phir elahabaad kii unki puraani haveli par bhaanti-bhaanti ke salaahkaar har shaam ikattha hokar rajeev gandhi ke patan kii yojana taiyaar kiya karte the
 They included eminent lawyers, activists, editors, retired bureaucrats
 kuch suna-suna sa lagata he na! dilli ke purv main kaushambi main kejariwal ke saamaanya-se apartment kii der shaamon se yah alag nahin he
 a very interesting and effective comparison is in language and symbols more than style
 ve
 P
 singh us dashak kii bheeshan garmi main bhi (1986 ke bhayanak sookhe ke baad) gramin elahabaad ke duurastha gaanvon main boforce ko samajhaate nahin thakte the
 They used to say, your houses have been broken
 kaise? ve tab naatakeey rup se apane kurte kii jeb se maachis nikaalte the
 When you spend four months (25 paise) and buy a matchbox, buy a bundle of beedi or take a little jaggery, then one or two paisa goes to the government as tax
 aapke hi is paise se sarkaar skool banaati he, aspataal banaati he or aapaki sena ke liye bandooken kharidti he
 If some money is taken in the brokerage, then it became equivalent to breaking the house? This was his response to the Congress critics who used to make fun of him by saying that who understands Bofors in far-flung villages? Kejriwal too has voiced his voice on petty corruption and non-equality
 Made simple to understand
 unke yah kehane main ki 'ye sab mili hue hai' thik ve
 P
 singh ke 'aapke gharon main send lag gai he' kii hi gunj sunai detii he
 If aap's listeners are in a lower class of Delhi living in inhuman conditions in an illegal colony or slum, who are forced to live a life worse than their income, then they will easily understand the myths of Kejriwal
 ve kehete hai ki bijepi va congress bilderon se mili hue hai isliye ve sari jhuggi bastiyon ko ujaad denge or aapako sadakon par phenk denge kyonki ve jaanate hai ki das hafte main aap thak-harkar apane gaanvon ko laut jaaenge, bhale hi jhuggiyon ko bedardi se ujaad diya jaataa ho, lekin asaliyat main koi shahar chhodkar nahin jaataa
 After this, Kejriwal tells today's prices of vegetables compared to his 49-day rule
 gobhi us samay 8 ru
 Kg, today Rs 60
 kilo he, gaajar 4 ru
 Kg, today Rs 40
 kilo he, tamaato 6 ru
 Was kg, today Rs 60
 kilo he
 i know some vegetable vendors around the rally grounds
 gobhi 15-20 ru
 Is kilo, carrot 8-10
 kilo or tamaato 18 ru
 Kg
 lekin agar aap raily main puuchhenge to ve yakeenan kahenge ki keemten aasmaan chhu rahi hai
 They say that LPG subsidy is being scrapped, milk is becoming more expensive and power companies are buying Congress and BJP
 jis tarah se paashchaatya or saamanti chhap ke baavjood ve
 P
 singh ko gramin garibon, musalamaanon or pichde virgon main nayaa vot bank mila, usee tarah kejariwal ne teji se shahrikrut hote bharat main vishaal nimna varg main apana khaas nayaa aadhaar khadaa kiya he
 If Advani pitted Hindutva against caste, V
 pi
 If defeated by Singh, Kejriwal is also fighting the class against Hindutva, Modiism and minorityism
 agar ve kaamyaab rahete hai to vah hamaari raajnneeti main mandal, mandir va modithv ke baad pehla nayaa bada vichaar hoga
 i can muster the courage to say that the results will have far-reaching ramifications, and remember that i am embroiled in the Anna movement and later the intense intellectual debate with you and i have had to face a lot of abuses, criticisms, slander
 
 punasch:27 saal guzar chuke hai
 i can only reveal an excerpt from my reporter diary in Allahabad
 ve
 P
 singh ne chunaavon kii saaf-suthri funding or kam se kam kharch karne par jor diya tha
 Promoting motorcycles was his favorite pastime
 ek subah, jab ve 'ranneeti' banane main lage the to khaadi pahane, jansatta ke sampadak prabhaash joshi andar aae
 He had a suitcase containing seven and a half lakh rupees
 nakad the
 He said that Chaudhary Devi Lal has sent this contribution for the campaign
 ve
 P
 singh gusse se baukhala gaye, yah paisa main kaise le saktaa hum
 All my propaganda is against this kind of politics
 joshi hanse or ve
 P
 singh ko vah kaha jo devilal ne kaha tha: raja sahab (ve
 P
 singh) ko kah dena prachaar ke liye petrol par chalane vaale vaahanon kii jarurat hoti he, jo paise se aata he
 When vehicles start running on air and water, there will be no need for money
 tab tak chup rahen or jo mil rahaa he, usase kaam chalaaen
 Moderate and silent V
 pi
 Singh did the same again
 isliye haasyaaspad do karod ru
 Comparison with aap's current embarrassment on its contribution is no coincidence

 Pradhan told that he walks with the paint and brush in the diggi of his car
 gaanv kii sadakon ke kinare va medon par lage pedo par vah chitra ukerne lagate hai

 The CBI court has sentenced Lalu Yadav to three and a half years in the case of withdrawal of 90 lakhs

 The judge said that he is a cowherd

 Lalu Yadav tweeted after the sentence

 But before the declaration of this punishment, there was uneasiness within Lalu Yadav
 doshi kaa thappa maathe par madha ja chukaa tha
 Lukudhki was increasing, sometimes due to illness, sometimes physical helplessness, sometimes due to the weather, Lalu kept pleading almost in front of the court
 lekin adaalat bhavanaaen nahin saboot ke aadhaar par chalati hai, or saboot kah rahe the ki lalu yadav jail main rahenge
 Now Lalu Yadav's political future is also imprisoned in the prison walls with him, so Tejaswi took the initiative to encourage the supporters

 But for Lalu's opponents, the New Year gift could not be better than this

 mohali vaise bhi team india ke liye lucky ground rahaa he or isi maidan par bharat ne laga di he jeet kii hetric
 This is the same ground where Australia has never been able to beat India
 kangaaroon kii buree gat kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 1970 ke baad pehali baar australia siries main 0-3 se pichad gai he or chaaron khaane chit hone kii kagaar par he
 With the victory of Mohali, captain MS Dhoni has also maintained his hundred percent record of victory over Australia in India
 ghar main australia ke khilaaf khele gaye saaton test main captain dhoni ne jeet hasil kii he
 Team India has realized its biggest dream by demolishing the fort of Shikhar Dhawan Australia
 mohali ke mahanayakon yakeenan shikhar dhawan sabase aage khadey hai or australian team ke sapane main shikhar jarur aaenge
 When Team India attained the pinnacle in the Test, new dreams, new hopes, new eyes began to float
 australia ke khilaaf tisare or apane kariyar ke pehle test main 187 ranon kii pari khelkar shikhar dhawan mohali ke sabase bade mahanayake ban gaye hai
 a hat-trick of victories in Test cricket and that too against Australia
 shaayad hi duniya main kisi ne sochaa hoga ki team india ye karishma bhi kar dikhaaegi
 But all this happened and the world is watching it
 duniya shikhar kii daad de rahi he, kyonki chaar din ke khel main agar shikhar naa hote hetric naa hoti
 In just 85 balls, Shikhar hit the first Test century in the first Test of his life
 duniya main kabhi kisi ne apane pehle hi test match main isse tej shatak nahin jamaaya
 Shikhar Dhawan played a huge innings of 187 runs off 174 balls in the Mohali Test
 shikhar dhawan ne 33 chauke or 2 chakke lagaae
 And the strike rate was 107
 47
 Shikhar not only dismantled the record, but also introduced a slew of new records for India
 shikhar se pehle kisi bhartiya openar ne apane pehle match main centuri nahin jadi thi
 No Indian batsman had scored a century in the first match within a single season
 lekin shikhar apni is mahanayake vaali recordtod pari kaa shrey dete hai, apni lucky charm patni aaysha ko
 To his two daughters and to his family
 chayankartaaon ne team se sahvaag ko baahar kiya or shikhar dhawan ko mauka diya
 It is said that time does not take long to change
 shikhar dhawan ko mauka mila to unhone sabit kar diya ki wo suurama hai
 On October 30 last year, Shikhar made Ayesha of Australia forever in Delhi
 bas tabhi se is ballebaaj kii qismat ne slo treks chhodkar kamyaabi kii superfast express pakad lee
 It was only after her marriage to Ayesha that Shikhar got the chance to play Test cricket for Hindustan for the first time
 ab ise ek sanyog hi kahenge ki pehali baar baigi blue cap pahanakar maidan main jalawaa dikhaane kaa mauka mila to wo bhi
 Shikhar's lady luck came out against her in-laws' team and as soon as she landed on the Test ground
 apni kismat ke is raushan sitare se milanaa bhi shikhar ke liye ek khubasurat ittefaq tha
 Ayesha was already present in Team India's Turbanator Harbhajan Singh's Friends list
 shikhar or aaysha ke lavamatch kii phixing karne vaala kupid koi or nahin balki khud bhajji hi the
 One is a strong cricketer from Delhi, the other is an amateur boxer from Australia
 donon ke shauk bhi milte-julate, donon tatu ke deevane, donon hi filmon ke shaukeen, bas dosti hone main zyada vakt nahin laga
 But Shikhar's heart was constantly asking for Ayesha, this heart is asking for more
 phir kya tha aaysha kii hari jhandi milte hi 2009 main donon ne sagaai kar lee or aakhirkaar 2012 main shikhar ne shaadi karke aaysha ko hameshaa ke liye apana bana liya
 Ayesha was about to have two lovely daughters in her life
 bas yaheen se shikhar kii kismat kii kitaab main kamyaabi ke sunahare harf judane shuru ho gaye
 Today not only Ayesha, but also her family is extremely proud of this success of Shikhar
 shikhar se safar kii shuruyaat karne vaale apane bete ke karname par pita kaa seenaa garv se phool gaya he
 Where the father is proud, the mother of Shikhar is also not able to bloom
 is maa ne apane bete kaa naam shikhar shaayad isiilie liye rakhaa tha
 Now the mother is waiting for the son to win the Mohali ground so that the son's favorite rajma-rice and non-veg food can be made by hand and feed
 sirf parivaar hi nahin balki dilli ke is diler par aaj saare desh ko naaj he
 This Jat Surma of Team India has seated the Kangaroos like a collar
 shuruyaat behtareen hui lekin shikhar, sitaron ke aage jahaan or bhi he
 Meet Murali Vijaymohali's second superstar
 inaki pahchaan kuch ye he ki australia ke khilaaf inkaa balla khub garajtaa he
 Yes, the name is Murali Vijay
 murali ne test kariyar main abhi tak 3 shatak lagaae hai or teenon hi australia ke khilaaf hai
 They also guarantee to win murali ne mohali main shatak kii aisi murali bajaai ki kangruon ko nachaa daalaa or gendbaaj murali ke wicket ko taras gaye
 Now it must have come straight to the understanding of Austalia as to which name Murali is
 maidan par tik jaae to kya hota he
 Team India is named after the bowlers' senses and victory
 murali vijay ne team india ke vijay rath ko aage badhaayaa or mohali test kii pehali pari main shandaar 153 ranon kii pari kheli
 Murali faced 317 balls, hit 19 fours and also had 3 skyscraper sixes
 murali vijay kaa strike rate rahaa 48
 Of 26
 2010 main bangalore main murali ne 139 ranon kii pari kheli or bharat 7 wicket se jeeta
 In 2013, Murali scored 167 runs in Hyderabad and won the match
 ab 153 ranon kii pari mohali main kheli or australia ke khilaaf jeet kii hetric lagava di
 Mahendra Singh Dhonidhoni, now it seems that the name is enough to win
 dhoni kii captaini main team india ko wo mila he, jo ajtak kisi captain kii captaini main nahin mila
 Australia has never had such a terrible fate
 hyderabad main haarane ke baad australian team main badlaav hue, puure australia main unki thu thu hui
 But still he could not save the hat-trick of defeat
 aaj dhoni kaa seenaa garv se chaudaa hua ja rahaa he
 Dhoni has shown the charisma that no captain has done against Australia
 pehali baar kisi captain ne australia ke khilaaf jeet kii hetric lagaai
 Dhoni has become the most successful captain of Team India
 aaj vakt dhoni ke saath he or record bhi
 The country is with Dhoni and all the fans of cricket
 diggajon main dhoni ke naam kii charchaa he
 Dhoni's success is being beaten
 mahendra singh dhoni ne mohali main 23waan test match jeeta he, jo dhoni ke captain number van banane kii gavaahi detaa he
 Sourav Ganguly led Team India to victory in 21 Test matches under his captaincy and now Captain Dhoni has won Team India in 23 Test matches
 jabaki mohammad ajaharuddin ke naam 14 test match jitaane kaa record he
 Dhoni's home record against Australia is also unmatched
 kangaaroon ke khilaaf unhone 7 maichon main kaman sanbhali or sabhi match main jeet team india kii hui he
 Today is the day to forget everything and celebrate
 dhoni mohali ke mahanayake hai, desh main unki dhooma he
 These ardent bowlers of Dhoni had 4 days to win, and then together they all created Australia's bed
 chaar din kaa khel or australia kii puri team do baar chaupat
 The bowlers of Team India made the condition of Australia that in their dreams they would persecute the Indian bowlers as awe
 raveendre jadeja- 6 wicketpragyan ojha- 4 wicketar aswin- 4 wicketbhubaneshwar kumaar- 3 wicketishanth sharma- 3 wickettim india ke gendbaazon ne australia ko dho daalaa, pehali pari main australia ne jor lagaaya 408 ran bana daale
 But no one has been able to stand in front of unity and solidarity and the Indian bowlers caught the rhythm, it was not only the fast bowlers also showed strength and dropped Australia to the ground
 or ye ban gaye mohali ke mahanayake
 The victory against Australia in Mohali is huge
 kyonki 4 din kaa vakt mila tha or usamen bhi pehla dedh din australia kha gaya
 But victory is still in the name of Team India
 australia ke khilaaf pehali pari main eshanth sharma or rabindra jadeja ne jor lagaaya or donon ne 3-3 wicket jatke
 Ojha and Ashwin's spin also did not go blank and both got 2-2 wickets
 lekin duusari pari main bhubaneshwar australia par kahar banakar barase or kangaaroon kii ridh tod di rabindra jadeja ne
 Both took 3-3 wickets
 bich-bich main aswin or ojha ne bhi apni bhoomika khub nibhaai
 Both took 2–2 wickets in their account
 or is tarah australia chauthe din team india ko 133 ranon kii chunauti de paaya
 Even though the first day of mohalitest was rained down, but in 4 days, Team India realized its dream

 The pm's statement stressed that there was no disturbance in the allocation
 tathyalekin 25 para ke baad unhone sweekaar kiya ki sarkaar ne un companiyon ke khilaaf karrwai shuru kar di he jinhone khanan shuru nahin kiya he
 According to the IMG report, 17 blocks have not even taken approval from the Forest Department, which is the initial stage

 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne kaha, ‘’shashan or raajnneeti main yah naitikta kii ghor upeksha he
 He has placed his responsibility step by step on the shoulders of other agencies
 ”pradhanmantri kii daleel ko na sirf vipaksh balki unke kuch sahyogiyon ne bhi khaarij kar diya he
 When former Telecom Minister A, sitting in Chennai
 raja ne koyala ghotaale par pradhanmantri kii daleelein sunin, to unhen sabase pehle to is par vishwaas hi nahin hua
 After this he whispered and said, "this is what i said two years ago
" ” diemke ke ek netaa ne kaha, ‘’aisa lagata he jaise javabdehi ko lekar do paimaane maujuud hai
 One for Congress and the other for its allies
 ” pradhanmantri abhi jo daleelein de rahe hai, raja ne bhi vahi daleelein di thim
 Like the Prime Minister, the king also questioned the way the CAG was calculated
 or bilkul pradhanmantri kii tarah raja ne bhi daawa kiya tha ki unka kaam buniyadi dhaanche kii jarurat ko puraa karnaa tha na ki rajasav kii jarurat ko puraa karnaa--yani raja ke maamle main mobile seva uplabdhta muhaiyaa karana or koyala ghotaale ke maamle main bijli ke utpaadan ko sunishchit karnaa
 At present, UPA allies have assured the Congress that they will not stand with the BJP in the attack on the Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri ab tak ke apane saarvajanik jivan main vishwasiyata ke sabase bade sankat se rubaru hai
 Yes, if the Prime Minister does not trust any one party then it is his own Congress party
 tajjub nahin hona chahie ki is maamle main andeh kaa shagufa or kisi ne nahin balki samaajawaadee party ke netaa mohan singh ne us samay choda jab unhone 29 agast ko kah daalaa ki shshcongress ke bheetar kuch log manmohan singh ko hatwakar yuvaraj (rahul gandhi) ko laana chaahate hai
 i am afraid that this whole game (demanded by BJP for the Prime Minister's resignation) is happening from within the Congress
 ” jaldibaji main congress mahasachiv janardan dvivedi ne is bayaan ko khaarij kar diya, lekin mohan singh ke shagufe ne afvaahon kaa bazaar garam kar diya
 a Congress MP from Andhra Pradesh said, "yes, we do not want to contest the next election under his leadership
 lekin unhen hataane kaa hamaare paas koi tarika nahin he
 After all, how do we kneel before the BJP? ”bjp's aggression has strengthened Manmohan Singh's position
 philhal to sahi sthiti he
 a cabinet minister said, "there is a lot of apprehension in whether we will contest the 2014 elections under his leadership
" koyale kaa dhabba itani aasaani se nahin jane vaala he
 “the biggest problem for the Congress is the assembly elections in three states
 gujarat, himachal or karnataka main congress or bijepi ke bich sidhi ladaai he or aise main manmohan singh kii chhavi mudda ban sakati he
 This is the reason why Congress President Sonia Gandhi has become an open attacker and has instructed her party to give a befitting reply to the BJP from Parliament to the road (see Raru Sonia took command in this issue)
 usee cabinet mantri ne kaha, jis desh daure par jane kaa pradhanmantri kaa yah sahi samay nahin tha
 As the leader of the government, he should have at least held command in his hands
 ”baharhaal, pradhanmantri videsh yatra se laut chuke hai or unhen iemji kii report padhpsi hogi jisane 53 aavantnon ko radd karne kii sifarish kii he
 If they accept its recommendations, they will be able to improve their image to some extent
 bijepi kii do maangen hai--licenson ko radd karnaa or pradhanmantri kaa istipha
 By accepting the recommendations, the Prime Minister will be able to satisfy at least half of the BJP
 varisht naukarshahon ke samooh kii report kii siforishein maananaa haalanki khatre se khaali na hoga
 The Prime Minister's two most spoken warlords have put their credibility at stake, stating there was no loss in coal block allocation
 ek baar phir unki daleelein chhin-bhinn ho jaaengi
 There is no way left for a government colored by a series of scandals to protect itself from the flames of coal

 ' tiemasi pramukh (mamata Banerjee) kii tippaniyon ko bharat kii ore se kii ja sakane vaali sambhavit sainya karrwai kii taraf ishaara mana ja rahaa he
 Reacting to Mamata's statement, BJP termed her charge as 'baseless'
 pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh dilip ghosh ne bataaya, ‘bebuniyaad aarope lagaana unki aadat he
 She talks in the air
 yadi unke paas saboot he to unhen ise saarvajanik karnaa chahie

 Many leaders of the Trinamool Congress have also said that Muslim voters, who keep fast during the holy month of Ramadan, will face problems
 mamata ne kaha, ‘main apane rajya ke logon ko jaanati hum
 i have great respect for the people of Bengal
 lekin bhaajapa unke prati anadar dikhaa rahi he
 They have conspired against me and Bengal, but it will backfire on them
 'ek sawaal ke jawaab main mamata ne kaha ki saat charnon main matdaan kii ghoshnaa sirf bihar, pashchim bengal or uttar pradesh ke liye kii gai he, jo yah tay karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaaengi ki centre main agali sarkaar kiski banegi
 There will be a contest between Trinamool Congress, CPI (M) -led Left Front, Congress and BJP for a total of 42 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal
