 Which party will come to power in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, who will be its Prime Minister? There is already a debate in this country
 par is bahes se dur surat main is baar ek ganesh aayojak mandal ne desh ke pradhanmantri ko lekar voting karwaane kaa faisla liya he
 This will be a new and different type of experiment in itself
 hoobahoo electronic voting mashin (iviem) kii tarah dikhne vaali voting mashin ke jariye surat kii janata desh ke pradhanmantri ko lekar apana mat degi
 For voting this machine has been prepared by Alakapuri youth Ganesh Mandal of Surat
 is mashin se voting ganesh utsav ke pratham din 9 sitambar se shuru hogi or parinaam 18 ko aayega
 During this time, the devotees who come to the Ganesh pandal to see Lord Ganesha will give their votes to the candidate for the post of PM in this machine
 is mashin par piem pad ke liye bijepi ke narendra modi, congress ke rahul gandhi, samaajawaadee party se mulaayam singh yadav, jediu ke nitish kumaar ko sthaan diya gaya he
 At the same time, another option has also been given, meaning that the public can vote for their PM post arbitrarily
 voting karwaane vaala alakapuri ganesh mandal aayojak dilip bhai lakhpati ne bataaya, 'is program main ham janata ko yah bataane kii koshish karenge ki survey kya hota he, opinian pole kya hota he
 We will present the results onscreen
 puure desh main ganpati kaa maahaul he, surat main bhi zyada he
 We have built the pavilion on the theme Udaipur Palace
 parinaam 18 taarikh ko aayega
 The name of the maker of the voting machine is Mashud Vohra
 vohara ne kaha, 'jab aayojakon ne yah concept mere saamne pesh kiya or kaha ki ham kuch aisa kar sakate hai ki logon kaa janamat hasil kiya ja sake, tab mere dimag main is mashin kaa khyaal aayaa
 This was the token box of Airtel, which i reversed to form EVM
 log batan press karenge, vot hamaare hamaare databes main seve ho jayega
 The vote will appear on the live screen and at the same time it can be seen on the Facebook page
 walantier ek-ek se vot karke nikal jaayenge, taaki multiple vot kii samasya na ho
 These machines will run in an area of 20 meters, which will be connected to wifi
 hamane isamen kuch bhi chipaaya nahin he, sab kuch paardarshee he
 ' elactoral bond kii vaidhata maamle kii aaj supreme court main sunwaayee thi
 a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi was hearing several petitions related to the use of electoral bonds for political funding
 sunwaayee ke dauraan association for democratic riforms(ediaar) ke vakil prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki nirvachan ayog ne bhi elactoral bond ko gambhir vishay bataaya he
 90% of the total bonds sold have been given to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 sunwaayee ke dauraan hi atorni general keke venugopal ne prashanth bhushan ko tokate hue kaha ki yahaan chunavi bhaashan na den
 At the same time, Chief Justice Gogoi said that now is the election time
 court ne prashanth bhushan se kaha he ki aap elactoral bonds par aatiai se mili hui jaankaree par halafanama daakhil karen
 The next hearing of the case will be held on 10 April
 is yachika main raajnneetik dalon ko videshon se milane vaale chande ko niyamit karne vaale act epasiare 2016 or 2018 kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata ko chunauti di gai he
 Earlier in the hearing on Wednesday, the central government defended its decision saying that it would bring transparency in political funding and fix accountability
 association for democratic riforms(ediaar) bhi un yachikakartaon main se ek he jinhone elactoral bond yojana 2018 par roak lagane kii maang kii he
 People's eye on electoral bonds is also because during the hearing of the case in the Supreme Court it was revealed that the money of leaders and their relatives increased by 500 per cent within five years
 political funding par philhal koi roak-tok nahin he
 a number of petitions are pending in the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court to ban political funding
 centre sarkaar ne elactoral bond launch karte vakt daawa kiya tha ki is bond ke jariye political funding main paardarshita aegi or raajnneetik chande ke rup main milane vaale kaale dhan par roak lagegi
 The result was the opposite
 isse pehle supreme court main 12 march ko hui sunwaayee main centre sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaai gai thi
 The Supreme Court had said that the central government has not made any permanent system on political funding
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se pehle hi elactoral bond par sawaal khadey kiye ja rahe hai
 The government introduced electoral bearer bonds to make funding for political parties transparent
 lekin raajnneetik dalon ko milane vaale chande kaa sorce pataa na hone ke chalate korporate chande ko aisa badhaava mila
 Also, money received from abroad also became legal
 jaaniye kyon elactoral bond par uth rahe hai sawaal--sorcej kaa zikr jaruri nahinkendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ne janvari 2018 main likhaa tha ki elactoral bond kii yojana political funding vyavastha main vittiya maamalon main dhaandhlee rokane or paardarshita laane ke liye laai gai he
 But it is not necessary to mention how political funding has been raised
 -finance bill 2017 main badlaavelactoral bond finance act 2017 ke tahat kuch badlaav kiye gaye the jinase political funding ko nuksaan pahunchaa
 Section 29C of the Representation of the People Act was amended
 kaha gaya ki elactoral bond se mili funding ko chunaav ayog kii jaanch ke daayre se baahar rakhaa jayega
 While objecting to these changes, the Election Commission had asked the Law Ministry for changes
 -sattadhara party ko mil rahaa zyada chandaelectoral bond se un raajnneetik partiyon ko zyada phayda ho rahaa he jinke haath main satta he
 According to the Association for Democratic Reforms, Rs 222 crore was donated by electoral bonds in the year 2017-18
 isamen se bhartiya janata party(bijepi) ko 210 karod (94
 5%), Congress got 5 crores and other parties got 7 crores
 -KYC norm kii baadhyatasarkaar ne janvari 2018 main elactoral bond ke notification jari karte samay yah bhi saaf kiya tha ki ise kharidne vaale ko puri tarah se no yor customers (kevaisi) norm puraa karnaa hoga or bank khate ke dwaara bhugtan karnaa hoga
 - Fake companies will get boost In the Companies Act 2013 it was said that a company will make 7 of its average total profit of last three years in a financial year
 5 percent se zyada kaa raajnneetik chanda nahin de sakati
 But the rules were changed to limitless funding
 companiyon ko is baat se bhi chhot mili he ki ve apane bahikhaate main yah baat chupa len ki unhone kis party ko chanda diya he
 The Election Commission has objected to all these changes
 isse is baat kaa jokhim badha he ki sirf raajnneetik dalon ko chanda dene ke liye farji companiyon kaa gathan ho

 He said that in the 1828 Gazetteer, Hamleton made no mention of the mosque, while Marco Polo did mention it
 saath hi ye daawa kiya gaya ki 360 mandir dhwast kiye gaye the
 Dhawan further said that in the East India Company's Gazetteer it is also said that there was a mosque, which is said to have been built by Babur, and there Hindus consider Rama's birthplace
 aitihaasik carnegi ke sketch or varnan bhi babar kii banaai masjid kii baat kehete hai
 The criterion pillar was estimated to be part of a Buddhist monastery

 Babur is said to have come to Ayodhya in 1528 and built a mosque
 shilaon par likhe aalekh par koi shaq-o shubahaa nahin kiya ja saktaa

 The existence of the mosque cannot be questioned even after not continuously offering namaz
 dhawan ne daawa kiya ki nirmohi akhaada jo shuru se hi is mukademe main rahaa he, usne bhi kai baar ye mana he ki uskaa aantarik ahaate par daawa nahin he
 It is also clear from the subsequent judgments that Muslims and Hindus worshiped inside the compound inside the building

 Mahant Raghubar Das's appeal was also rejected by the then local court
 dhawan ne aage kaha ki gajetir ke mutabik bhi nirmohi akhaada ramghat par chalaa gaya tha
 Once the disputed building was in need of repair, the administration took the lead from the Muslims
 tab ram chabutara hi ram janm sthaan mana or kaha jaataa tha

 vidhansabha chunaav kaa nakkaara bajte hi dilli waalon ke chaaron taraf vaadon ke bhanvare mandaraane lage hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party, Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress are all serving the plate of promises in their own style
 yah bhi saaf jaahir kii teenon partiyon ke vaade kamobesh ek se hai, agar kahin fark he to unhen pesh karne ke lahaze main
 And the funny thing about it is that these are the promises that have been hovering over the skies of Delhi like chiles flying over the big garbage shops here for the last several elections
 yahaan ham kuch vaadon ko sachaai kii kathor jameen se takaraakar dekhte hai-sasti bijli-yah vaada aam aadmi party kaa sabase priy vaada he
 Arvind Kejriwal has caught it since the Aam Aadmi Party did not even exist
 shuruyaat se party kah rahi he ki vah bijli ke bill 30 fisadi tak kam kar degi or iske liye koi atirikt sabsidi dene kii bhi jarurat nahin he
 In his 49-day government, AAP did this too, but he had to resort to subsidy to do this work
 tab party ne kaha ki yah fori raahat he, lekin jald hi vah aisi vyavastha karenge ki bijli bina sabsidi ke sasti ho jaaegi
 In fact, the Aam Aadmi Party makes this promise based on a report of the Delhi State Electricity Regulatory Commission that came out in 2010
 is rapat main kaha gaya tha ki bijli companiyaan zyada paisa vasuul rahi hai or agar ve uchit munaafe par kaam karen to bijli ke daam 30 fisadi kam ho sakate hai
 But after changing the chairman of the commission, the commission too forgot its report
 is report kaa swabhaav bahut kuch kaalpanik (hypothatical) he
 It can also be shown on paper, but in the agreements and laws under which power is being distributed in Delhi, it is almost impossible to persuade private companies for this
 aise main agar koi sarkaar paanch saal ke liye aegi to is vaade par amal karne main uskaa khajaana khokhla jayega
 Similarly, BJP is saying that they will provide electricity for 24 hours
 dilli main vaise bhi bijli kii supplai 24 ghante jaisi he, bijli unheen coloniyon main katati he, jahaan se bill puri tarah nahin milte
 This is an undisclosed policy of the Energy Department of Delhi
 ise ucch adhikari of record baatcheet main hameshaa sweekaar karte rahe hai
 In the way Prime Minister Narendra Modi advocates the principle of Value for Money, it is difficult to get 24-hour power supply to these colonies
 kyonki 24 ghante bijli dene ke liye garibon se sakhti se bill vasuulana hoga, jo ab tak kisi raajnneetik dal ne nahin kiya
 Pani - There is an imbalance of ground-sky in Lutyens' Delhi and other areas in the supply of water in Delhi
 is asantulan ko dur karne kii himmat koun netaa dikhayega
 The leaders have no longer done this by cutting their share of water and giving it to the poor
 aise main raajnneetik dal haryana se munak nahar ke jariye pani laane kaa jhunjhuna pakadaate hai
 All three parties are making this promise, but even after 15 years of Congress and 10 Congress governments in Haryana, there was no water
 haryana pani degaa to uske kisaanon ko dikkat aegi
 In such a situation now that there is a BJP government in the Center and Haryana, the ground situation will not change in the way the BJP is in Delhi
 haryana sarkaar ke liye yah raajnneetik rup se bahut kathin faisla he ki jis pani kaa istemaal uske kisaan varshon se kar rahe hai, use dilli ke liye chhod diya jaae
 Regularization of irregular colonies - If you mind, before the 2008 assembly elections, this was the bet the Congress had made
 tab 1,000 se adhik coloniyon ko niyamit karne kaa vaada tha or khud congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne coloniyon ko proviginal certificate baante the
 But this promise was waiting for the full five years to materialize
 kabhi emsidi to kabhi didie ne isamen adnga daal diya
 The extent was reached when a dispute arose over the exact number of colonies
 is chunaav se thik pehle bijepi ne bhi 900 se adhik coloniyon ko niyamit karne kii baat kahi he
 In such a situation, making a claim about how long Red Lingship will allow this promise to be implemented will be nothing but outrage
 naukari kaa contract system khatm karnaa-yah ek aisa vaada he jiske bare main kuch na hi kaha jaae to behatar he
 All the political parties of the country are promoting the contract system in the areas under their rule
 desh kii sari niti is system kii taraf bad gai he
 Economic reforms are the first thing to see
 aise main kam se kam bijepi or congress to yah kaam nahin hi karenge
 It is a matter of the Aam Aadmi Party, from where will it bring the money to fulfill this promise, because the major share of Delhi's expenditure is still from the money received from the central government
 yani vaadon kii duniya lakh haseen ho, par use amal main laane ke raste bahut sankare hai
 Living with a population of 5 times its capacity, this city still has a long way to go to become a better city to live
 ho saktaa he, us lambey safar ke baad ye vaade hakeekat ban jaaen
 But at the moment, they are just like the reality of heaven

 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye madhyapradesh congress ne star prachaarkon kii nai suchi jari kii he lekin is suchi main vyaapman ke aaropee doctor gulab singh kiraar kaa naam sabko hairaan kar rahaa he
 In this list of Congress, while the name of Congress national president Rahul Gandhi is on the list of star campaigners, there are big names like Sonia Gandhi, Digvijay Singh, Ashok Gehlot and Jyotiraditya Scindia, including former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while in the list at number 36
 The name of Dr
 Gulab Singh Kirar is shocking because the Congress has tremendous influence on the Shivraj government
 Defense said were planted had serious charges
 haal hi main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bhi vyaapman congress ke bade muddon main se ek tha
 The Congress had accused Kirar of being close to the then Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 haalanki gulab singh kiraar pichley saal vidhansabha chunaav ke thik pehle indore main rahul gandhi ke saamne congress main shaamil hue the jisapar tab vivaad ho gaya tha or congress ne aanan-fanan main kiraar ke party main shaamil hone kaa khandan kiya tha
 Now, with the name of Gulab Singh Kirar in the list of star campaigners, questions are being raised on the Congress
 gulab singh kiraar par aarope he ki 2011 main yojit pre-piji pariksha main galat tareeke se apane bete kaa ek medical college main daakhila karaayaa tha
 After this, in 2015, the BJP suspended Gulab Singh Kirar from the primary membership of the party
 congress ne 40 star prachaarkon kii jo suchi jari kii he usamen 36wein number par gulab singh kiraar kaa naam he
 Kirar left the BJP and joined the Congress during the assembly elections
 unke congress main shaamil hone par bhi kai tarah ke sawaal uthe the, kyonki unka naam vyaapman ghotaale main aayaa tha
 Before the assembly elections, the Congress had vigorously raised the Vyapam scam and the Congress had fiercely attacked the BJP over Gulab Singh Kirar
 kiraar kii purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan se bhi nazdikiyaan hone kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Kirar was later suspended from the BJP
 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan kiraar congress main shaamil ho gaye or ab loksabhaa chunaav ke star prachaarak kii suchi main unka naam he
 Let us tell you that in this Lok Sabha election, the Congress has nominated many leaders who lost in the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh
 iske saath hi party ne star prachaarkon kaa ek bada samooh party ke prachaar prasar ke liye maidan main utaara he jisamen kiraar kaa bhi naam shaamil he
 In this election, the challenge before the Congress is to get better results than the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 pichley chunaav main congress ko rajya kii 29 main se sirf do siton par jeet mili thi or baad main hue upachunaav main congress ne ratlam loksabhaa seat par jeet darj kii thi
 This time the Congress is ruling in the state at the time of Lok Sabha elections and it is trying to make its lead based on the functioning of the last few months

 unki is ghoshnaa kaa vipaksh or satta paksh donon ne megen thapthapaakar swaagat kiya
 Shortly thereafter, Deputy Chairman Rehman Khan called on Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal to place the copyright bill in the House for discussion
 pratilipyaadhikaar sanshodhan vidheyak ko charchaa kii khatir rakhane ke liye sibbal khadey ho pate, isse pehle hi jad you ke shivanand tiwari ne vyavastha kaa sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki sadan ke niyamon ke anusaar koi bhi sadsy aise mudde par charchaa main bhaag nahin le saktaa jisase unke hiton main takaraav ho
 Tiwari said that Sibal's sons are lawyers of a famous music company
 chunki yah kapirite se judaa maamla he, isliye isamen hiton kaa takaraav he
 tdp's Mysoora Reddy said that several cases related to copyright were pending in various courts of this well-known company
 in maamalon main sibbal ke putr us company ke vakil hai
 In such a situation, they should not put this bill up for discussion
 sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal ne safai dete hue kaha ki yah hiton ke takaraav kaa maamla nahin he
 Conflict of interest occurs in the case of dependent children
 is mudde par satta paksh or vipaksh ke kuch anya sadsy bhi bolnaa chaahate the lekin hangaame ke kaaran khan ne baithak ko shaam kareeb chaar bajkar 50 minute par 15 minute ke liye sthagit kar diya
 On the resumption of the meeting, bjp's Prakash Javadekar said that when the Bill was introduced in the House by Sibal, the matter of conflict of interest was not in the cognizance of the members
 baad main yah baat saamne aane par ham log ise sadan main uthaanaa chaahate hai
 The uproar continued despite Khan making several appeals to the members to calm down, leading to the adjournment of the House for a day ahead of schedule

 pipuls democratic party (PDP) pramukh mahabuuba mufti ne visthapit kashmiri panditon kii ghati main sammaan or garima ke saath vaapasi kii ichha jaahir kii
 Mehbooba said this while addressing a meeting in Jammu with displaced members of the Kashmiri Pandit community
 unhone kaha, ‘kashmiri pandit samudaay ne ateet main kashmiri samaaj ke uddhaar main mahatvapurn yogadan kiya he
 This is the time of his return home with respect and dignity
 ’jammu-kashmir main haal hi main ai bheeshan baadh ke babat mahabuuba ne kaha, ‘kashmir ne ek baar phir bade paimaane par tabaahi jheli
 However, this time it was due to the havoc of nature, but it exacerbated the difficult situation arising out of the dreadful events that took place in the 1990s, which caused a large number of people, especially Kashmiri Pandits, to leave their homes

 The comments prasar bharti ne bhi tevar kade karte hue kaha he ki agar suryadevara ne jwine nahin kiya to unke barkhaastagi kii karrwai kii jaaegi
 But for Prasanna, who came on deputation from Prasar Bharati, the Speaker presided over the Lieutenant Governor
 kaha ''takaraav maine nahin khadaa kiya, alji ne khadaa kiya he
 Before i received the letter from LG, i received a letter from the Services Department of the Government of Delhi

 It is worth mentioning that a few days ago Prasanna strongly advocated the appointment of Parliamentary Secretary by writing an article
 isi ke baad dilli sarkaar or alji ke bich is adhikari ke tabadale ko lekar talavaarein khinch gai hai
 One officer remained very special in the special session

 pakistan kii harkaton se bharat to pareshaan rahata hi he, afghanistan or iran jaise uske duusare padosi desh bhi pareshaan hai
 Afraid of Pakistan's shelling and the interference of the Pakistan Army in the internal affairs of its country, Afghanistan has complained to the United Nations (UN)
 pakistan pichley kai saal se afghanistan kii seemaa main gole daagta rahaa he
 Apart from this, by increasing relations with Taliban, Pakistan is also interfering in its internal affairs
 iconomic times ke anusaar, afghanistan sarkaar ne 22 farvari ko likhe ek letters main 'pakistani sena dwaara afghanistan kii seemaa main lagaataar atikaraman' kii shikaayat kii he
 In its letter, the Government of Afghanistan has urged the United Nations to take necessary steps to resolve the matter effectively
 is khat ke anusaar, pakistan ne saal 2012 se 2017 ke bich afghanistan kii seemaa main 28,849 gole daage
 Because of this, 82 people died in Afghanistan and 187 people were injured
 ek hafte ke bheetar afghanistan sarkaar dwaara is maamle main yuan ko likhaa gaya yah doosraa letters he
 Afghanistan had earlier complained in the letter that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan was going to have a meeting with Taliban leaders in Islamabad
 us letters main afgaan sarkaar ne kaha tha, 'yah meeting afghanistan kii shanti prakriya ko damit karti he or 'afghanistan kii rashtriya samprabhutaa kaa ulanghan karti he
 After this, this meeting had to be canceled
 taliban netaaon ne is baithak ko cancil karte hue kaha tha ki sanyukt raashtra or america dwaara unki yatraaon par kai tarah ke pratibandh lagane kii vajah se ve pakistan nahin ja sakate
 It was revealed that Pakistan is trying to convince the Taliban from its level
 sanyukt raashtra main afghanistan ke up sthaayee pratinidhi najiphulla salarzai ne is letters main likhaa he, 'pakistan dwaara in ulalanghanon ke prakruti kii baat karen to ve lagaataar afghanistan kii seemaa main golibari kar rahe hai, khaskar kunar or nangarhaar praant ke jilon or gaanvon main
 Pakistan is continuously encroaching the border of Afghanistan by sending its military aircraft and installing military outposts, barriers, fences
 'afghanistan kaa kahana he ki pakistan yah harakat saal 2012 se hi kar rahaa he, lekin 2017 ke baad isamen teji ai he
 Since the beginning of 2018, Pakistan has encroached on the border 161 times in Afghanistan and fired 6,025 shells
 iske pehle isi maheene ne aatankwaad ko badhaava dene ke liye pakistan ke ambesder ko notice jari kiya tha
 27 Revolutionary Guards were killed in a terrorist attack in the southeast of Iran
 is aatanki ghatana kii jimmedaari pakistan ke ek aatanki sanghathan jaish-ul-adal ne lee he
 Iran's President Hassan Ruhani had clearly stated that Iran will avenge the blood of its soldiers

 justise divai chandrachud ne kaha ki nirmohi akhaade dwaara prastut vaad ke chalaae jane kii yogyata ke bare main prashn uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Dhawan said that what the Nirmohi Arena was challenging, what he wanted, but it would not be right for me to raise this issue
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki nirmohi ke maamle main sakshya or gavaahi paryaapt nahin hai
 Dhawan said that you cannot take any action for illegality and try to profit from it, even if you do not create illegality, you still cannot believe it
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki trustee or sevadaar main antar hota he shaviyat maalik nahin hota he
 The day the court order came, that is, January 5, 1950, the day the Continuous Rong comes to an end
 nirmohi akhaade ne agar samay se pehle, yani chah saal pehle akhaade ne resiver niyukt karne ko chunauti di hoti to thik tha, lekin nirmohi akhaade ne chah saal kii tay samay seemaa ke baad chunauti di, isliye nirmohi akhaade kaa daawa nahin banataa
 Their petition should be dismissed
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki ek trust yaa trustee ke vipareet shebet ke adhikaar kaa daawa nahin kar saktaa
 Muslims have not entered there since 1934, but when you do not allow them to enter, how will they pray? We support the claim of the Nirmohi Akhara, that is, the serviceman, but his title does not become right
 agar nirmohi akhaade ko sevadaar kaa adhikaar he, maan bhi liya jaae ki sevadaar kaa adhikaar pidiyon tak chalata he, to phir property kaa maalik koun he, kya next fred ko mana jayega, phir nirmohi akhaade ko sevadaar se hataane kaa dar kaisaa, koun maalik yaa trustee he
 On Friday, Zafaryab Jilani will argue in the matter on behalf of the Sunni Waqf Board, followed by Rajiv Dhawan again
 purv kendriya vitt mantri or congress netaa pi chidambaram (P Chidambaram) ne modi sarkaar dwaara pesh bajet (union Budget 2019) kii aalochana kii he
 He said that this government's policy on employment is 'pakaudanomics'
 unhone kaha ki NSSO (neshnal cemple survey offis) kaa data kabhi sarkaar paarit nahin karti he, lekin yah sarkaar aisa tark de rahi he
 This cannot be accepted
 aankade kehete hai ki berogari kaa dar 45 saalon main sarvaadhik he or sarkaar ke paas jawaab tak nahin he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi, while reacting to the budget, said that this vote was not on account but account for votes
 vittamantri ke lambey bhaashan ne sabar kaa imtihaan liya
 It was a full-fledged budget with an election speech which is against the rules of the Constitution
 aisa vahi sarkaar karti he jise vaapasi kaa bharosa nahin hota
 He said that a nominal Rs
 6000 has been announced annually for the farmers, which is welcome
 lekin iske liye 20,000 karod udhaar liya jayega
 The same trend will continue in the future
 gaiyr kisaan garib, shahari garib, khetihar mazdooron ke liye sarkaar ke paas kya he? sarkaar khud ke banaae farji aankadon ko maanati he
 Gandhi said that the announcement of 750 crores for cow, department for fisheries, pension schemes etc
 raises the question that if these were necessary, what did the government do for five years? The government has missed its fiscal deficit target for the second consecutive year
 jharkhand ke congress netaa yogendra saav ke aadhikarik profile par yakeen karen to ve hindi upanyaas ke samraat munshi premchand ke ghor prashansak hai
 But it seems that he has not learned anything from the characters of the stories of his beloved writer, in which the message is that when power or authority comes in hand, the human being should rise above the narrow
 rajya abhi rashtriya nishanebaaj tara shahdev prakaran main abhiyukt rakibul hasan ke kaale samrajya main netaaon, mantriyon, jajon or afasaron ke naam aane se chaunkaa hi tha ki krishi mantri saav ko lekar hue sangeen khulaason ne sabko hairaan kar diya
 On 2 September, Hazaribagh police in Chumba village arrested Saav's classmate and five important members — Sandeep Saw, Nakula Saw, Ramchandra Saw and Prakash Saw — including Rajkumar Gupta, the 'operational head' of the criminal gang Jharkhand Tigers
 yah saav ko musiibat main daalane ke liye paryaapt tha
 During the police investigation, Gupta told that the minister had formed this illegal organization and kept a close watch on its activities
 saav pehali baar congress ke tikat se vidhayak bane or 2013 main hemanth sorain kii sarkaar main krishi mantri niyukt hue the
 It is alleged that Savu prepared the Jharkhand Tigers in 2013 to raise money in a confidential manner
 unka makasad hazaribagh ke motaa munafa kamaane vaale avaidh koyala vyapaariyon ko lootnaa tha
 They wanted to prevent illegal organizations like the Third Presentation Committee and the Jharkhand Presentation Committee from becoming sole contractors for collection of money
 ye sanghathan paisa bator kar maalamaal ho chuke hai
 It is alleged that Gupta was a member of the Third Presentation Committee, which broke away from the Naxalite organization, which later went to the Jharkhand Presentation Committee and finally became the head of the Jharkhand Tigers
 achche sargana kii tarah saav ne kathith rup se apane sanghathan ko shuruaati 'puunji' ke rup main paanch hathiyaar or chaar motor cycilen bhi di
 Jharkhand Tigers started committing levy, kidnapping for ransom, threatening
 police sutron ke mutabik, kuch rukaawaton ke baad yah giroh har maheene 50 lakh ru
 Managed to rob
 lekin saav itani rakam se santusht nahin the
 Slowly, the work was being done to suit his wish
 lekin 18 agast, 2014 ko apana 50waan janmdin manaane ke saath hi takadir ne unka saath jaldi chhod diya
 After the serious revelations, Sawa stepped down as Agriculture Minister on 12 September
 andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki saav ne kursi aasaani se nahin chodi
 He kept on repeating the conspiracy hatched to tarnish his image
 ve tab hi kursi chhodie ko raji hue jab mukhyamantri hemanth sorain ne congress netritv se ijaajat le lee ki istipha na dene par saav ko barkhaast kar diya jaae
 It is being said that Hemant told him that the Congress was also in favor of removing him soon, when Sav resigned
 saav ne kaha he ki yah unke siyaasi virodhiyon kii sajeesh he
 He even accused the Hazaribagh police of having met the Third Presentation Committee
 (yogendra saav or jharkhand tiger kaa kathith sargana raju saav laal ghere main)chatur khilaadi saav jharkhand police ko jaanch main sahyog dene ke liye vahaan nahin rahe balki dilli chale gaye
 They did not appear despite summons from the police
 ve dilli main jharkhand bhawan main deraa daale hue hai or party ke bade netaaon se milane kii koshish main hai
 Now they are trying to get the wife from Congress for the second option i
e
 the upcoming assembly elections
 lekin is baar saav ke liye kathinaaiyaan adhik hai kyonki congress aakaaon ko unki karatuuton ke bare main sab kuch bataa diya gaya he
 The Congress is also hesitating to support him as the sensational case of Sau has given the BJP a weapon against the UPA
 sutron ke mutabik, police ke paas telephone par baatcheet kii kai ricoding he, jisamen unhen gupta se jharkhand tigers ke abhiyaanon ke bare main baatcheet karte suna ja saktaa he
 In one such conversation, Savu looks annoyed when a new recruit from Jharkhand Tigers escapes with three weapons
 ve gupta ko paryaapt sankhya main paidal sipaahi recruit na karne or sanghathan ko taqatvar na banane ke liye fatkaarte hai
 In another conversation, Saw and Gupta can be heard discussing the younger man and the older man
 police kaa maananaa he ki yah kharide jane vaale hathiyaaron ke liye kuta shabd ho saktaa he, jo chote or bade hathiyaaron ke liye istemaal kiye gaye honge
 In the conversation, they are openly discussing the operations of Jharkhand Tigers
 phone record se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki saav, gupta or duusare sadasyon ke niyamit sampark main the
 There was constant talk on his personal and government phones
 gupta mantri ji ke ranchi or hazaribagh awaas par bhi akasar jaataa rahata tha
 Hazaribagh police also found a photo taken on May 21, in which Yogendra Saw is seen sitting in a chopper with Raju Saw, a founder member of the Jharkhand Tigers
 aarope he ki isi raju saav ne central kol fields limited ke ek karmchaaree bhavani mahato ke apharan kii sajeesh rachi thi
 He was kidnapped in June 2014 for extortion
 raju 13 june se hi nyaayik hiraasat main he
 Sau's closeness to Raju became evident when the Congress decided to reshuffle the party organization after a bitter defeat in the Lok Sabha elections in May
 tab saav ne raju ko rajya congress mahasachiv niyukt karne kii sifarish kii thi
 In a letter to State Congress President Sukhdev Bhagat, Saw had awarded Raju with adjectives such as' karmath ',' energetic ',' devoted and 'popular social worker'
 yah party ke liye acha rahaa ki bhagat ne mantri kii ichchhaaon kaa paalan nahin kiya
 Clearly, the politics of the state represents such criminal elements which are at the center of the politics of the state
 ye netaa gangster, apni jati yaa samudaay ke mukhiya or thekedaar bhi hai
 They have made politics a business and are working in a political scenario where the line separating politicians and criminals is becoming increasingly blurred
 saav kii tikadambaaji kaa pataa pichley saal bhi chalaa tha, jab unhone agast 2013 main apane samarthakon ke saamne mantri banane kaa rahasy ujagar kiya tha
 In an honor ceremony in his home district, Hazaribagh, he said, "understand, what i did from Ahmed Patel to Sonia Gandhi to Rahul Gandhi cannot be explained in detail
" yah ham hi jaanate hai
 In politics, shoe has to be done from chest to Chandi text
 '' unka durbhaagya ki us samaaroh kii video ricoding kii gai thi or vah saarvajanik bhi ho gai
 However, at that time, the Congress leadership had spared Saw
 lagata he isi vajah se is inter paas netaa ke hausale buland ho gaye
 Three of the bungalows meant for mlas are still in Ranchi
 saav apana lakshya hasil karne ke liye phaltu bolne se ab bhi baj nahin aate
 But it can be difficult for the Congress to keep them together, even if they consider Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi as their ideals

 With just a cordial letter from Prime Minister Narendra Modi canceling his visit to Japan in the first week of July, the sentiments calmed
 daura radd karne kii khabar se bhi zyada bada maamla yah tha ki japan ko isaki khabar media se hi lagi thi or usne apane nakhushi jaahir karne main koi vakt bhi jaaya nahin kiya
 But the diplomatic gag in which there was every possibility of a fire, it was immediately brought under control
 baad main pataa chalaa ki yah chitthee aadhikarik se zyada nijee kism kii thi, usamen dil ko chune vaali baaten thim or unheen loktantric mulyon kaa hawala diya gaya tha jo donon deshon ko ek sutara main baandhta he
 It also cited its presence in the budget session of Parliament in the first week
 yah daleel japan ke pradhanmantri shinjo abe ko fouran raas aa gai or maamla jahaan kaa tahaan shant ho gaya
 In many ways, it also reveals the depth of personal relationship between the two leaders, which Modi developed as the Chief Minister of Gujarat many years ago by increasing investment prospects for Japanese companies
 gujarat main japani kaarobaariyon ko jo apekshaakrit zyada sahuuliyat mili hui hai, usase modi kii badi rajanyik puunji taiyaar hui he
 With his help, he can now reach bilateral talks effectively in his first visit to Tokyo
 modi puraane japani samrajya kii rajdhani kiyoto bhi jaaenge, jahaan jane kaa nimantran unke purvavarti manmohan singh sweekaar nahin kar paae the
 The strategic partnership between the two countries has been around for years, but personal ties between Modi and Abe form the foundation of a new kind of strategic relationship
 china se bigadate rishton ke kaaran japan asia main nae saajheedaaron kii talash main he or bharat iskaa swaabhaavik vikalp pesh karata he
 Japan has a growing number of elderly in society, while India has the largest population of young people, which is a better option for sustainable and strong economic partnerships, especially in the case of the production sector
 or ant main japan ke paas paryaapt puunji he or bharat nivesh ke liye lalayit he
 For a long time, Japan has been in a dilemma with China's disinterest
 khaskar china main japani aarthik hiton par mandaraate saayon ko lekar uski chintaaen bad rahi hai
 But this environment has changed over the years and Abe has become a symbol of this change in Japan
 unki ranneetik soch hind mahaasaagar or prashanth kshetra ke bich pul kaa kaam karti he kyonki japan main ab hind mahaasaagar-prashanth kshetra main mail-milaap kii charchaaon kaa daur tej ho gaya he
 For this reason, India is considered a partner and an important role in the balance of power of the region
 yahi baat ab tokyo kii vyaavhaarik niti kaa aadhaar ban rahi he
 The new interpretation of the Japanese Constitution's concept of collective self-defense initiative has opened the way for a new strategic partner in Japan
 modi ke daure ke dauraan isi tarah ke kisi samjhaute ke hone kii ummid kii ja rahi he
 With this, progress is also expected on the civil nuclear agreement
 haalanki japan main parmaanu samjhaute ko lekar gharelu bhavanaaen bhi isamen ek bada roda ban sakati hai
 But apart from this traditional talk of strategic issues, the real potential lies in the economic field
 sawaal yah he ki aakhir bharat ko japani nivesh kaa kaise swaabhaavik thikaana banaaya jaae
 There are many hurdles in this matter, but a personal kind of personal relationship between Modi and Abe can create a new kind of trust
 isaki ek vajah yah bhi he ki donon ek hi tarah kii raajnneeti main yakeen karte hai
 Abe also had a comfortable relationship with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh but this relationship was similar to that between a professor and a student
 ise japani pradhanmantri khud bataaya karte the
 Abe was often treated with respect at meetings, especially with Manmohan Singh's knowledge of economic matters
 lekin modi ke saath rishta samaan str kaa he or shaayad zyada sahaj or maujuun he
 Both leaders have won the election by raising the aspirations of the people in their respective countries and both seem ready to execute those promises
 iskaa arth chaahe kuch buniyadi maamalon main samjhauta karnaa hi kyon na ho
 Abe introduced abenomics and the "china Plus Forest Policy", while Modi has just started
 manmohan singh ke ulat, abe apni baaten khulkar modi ke saath saajha kar sakate hai or fouran vyaavhaarik or rajnatik str par muddon kii baat kar sakate hai
 This is the strategic opportunity through which Modi's visit this year can be significant

 In a special conversation with India Today, the Captain said that he had advised Sidhu not to go to Pakistan, yet Sidhu decided to go to Pakistan
 bataa den ki imran sarkaar kii ore se nyote ke baavjood captain amarinder singh ne 28 november ko kartarpur sahib coridor ko lekar pakistan kii ore se yojit kaarykram main hissaa lene se manaa kar diya tha
 Regarding Punjab local bodies minister Sidhu's visit to Pakistan, the captain said, "when a minister tells me to go on a personal visit to Pakistan or some other country, i do not refuse him to go
" siddhu ne mujhase kaha ki wo pakistan janaa chaahate hai to maine manaa nahin kiya
 Because it was a private visit and not an official government visit
 lekin baad main jab ravivaar ko siddhu madhya pradesh main the to maine unase kaha ki maine pakistan naa jane kaa stand punjab ke deergh hit main liya he
 i want you to reconsider your decision too
 is par siddhu ne kaha ki main unka nyotaa sweekaar kar chukaa hum
 On this i told Sidhu that he can be told that our Chief Minister has made a decision, in view of that i am unable to come
 is par siddhu ne kaha ki main shaam tak aapako bataata hum
 But then he did not come
 ” bataa den ki captain kii salaah ke baavjood siddhu pakistan ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye
 When Captain was asked if Sidhu did not go to Pakistan and disobeyed the Chief Minister
 is par mukhyamantri ne saaf kiya ki unhone siddhu ko sirf salaah di thi aadesh nahin
 Because it was a personal visit, not a government visit
 captain ne ye bhi kaha ki siddhu jaaen yaa nahin jaaen isse jamini sthiti par koi fark nahin padataa
 On being asked that on one hand you are apprehensive about the activities of Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI to spread terrorism in India including Punjab and on the other hand, your government's minister (sidhu), Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan is the messenger of peace and angel Explains, is this not going to convey the message of duplication in the stand of the Punjab Government? In response to this question, the captain said, 'most of the people of Punjab think that which is my stand
 jahaan tak kartarpur sahib coridor kaa sawaal he to ham tahe dil se uskaa swaagat karte hai
 We have been demanding this for years
 jab hamaari pehle punjab main sarkaar thi to maine tab bhi parvej musharraf ke saamne ye mudda uthaaya tha
 i congratulate the Prime Ministers of both India and Pakistan for the corridor
 coridor kaa swaagat bharat samet puure vishwa kaa sikh samudaay karata he
 'lage Hath Captain Amarinder also referred to the nefarious antics of the Pakistani Army
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ‘pakistan ke sena pramukh general qamar javed bajva se meraa kahana he ki wo jo hamaare punjab main kar rahe hai, wo kisi bhi surat main sweekaar nahin
 According to the Captain, in the last 18–19 months, we have destroyed 19 modules of terrorism in Punjab
 81 aatankwaadiyon ko pakadaa he
 77 weapons have been recovered
 saath hi grenads, idi or visphotak saamagree baraamad kii he
 The Captain also referred to the grenade attack on the Nirankari prayer site in Amritsar recently in which 3 people died and 19 were injured
 captain ke mutabik pakistan kii taraf se ek taraf shanti kii baat or duusari taraf logon kii hatyaein, ye sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Asked if there is any move of Pakistan to forward the name of Kartarpur Sahib Corridor to mindwash Sikh youths when they reach Pakistan? What is the risk of terrorism rising from this? In response to this question, the captain said, 'I do not think it will happen
 kartarpur sahib border se bahut kam duuri par sthit he
 In such a situation, it does not appear that Pakistan will get more contact with the pilgrims going there
 ’ captain ne ye bhi kaha ki coridor nirmaan hone par jo pehla jattha kartarpur sahib mattha techne jayega, usamen ve bhi shaamil honge
 When the Captain was asked that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has expressed his intention to send Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the SAARC Conference to be held there, would you like to say anything to the Prime Minister? So he said that these Prime Ministers will decide themselves, how can they give any advice on this
 captain amarinder singh ne kaha ki agar pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan vaaki donon deshon ke bich shanti ke liye gambhir hai to unhen pehle apane sena pramukh general bajva se kahana chahie ki wo iesai ko punjab samet bharat main apni napak harkaton se baj aane ke liye kahe
 If this does not happen then the tension will increase and then the Indian Army is fully capable to deal with such challenges
 upi sarkaar ne soobe main sibar aparaadhon kaa graph chadhane kii baat sweekaar karte hue kaha ki vah halaat ko kaabo main karne ke liye rajya str par alag se kanoon banane par vichaar kar rahi he
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mohammad Azam Khan said in the Assembly that the state government has given instructions to enact a separate cyber crime law from the Home Department, so that the increasing number of such crimes can be curbed
 basapa sadsy dharmpal singh ke sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue unhone kaha ki ham chaahate hai ki yah kanoon sarvasammati se bane
 Abusive language is being used on social websites, but due to lack of strict laws, not much can be done against it

 But at that time everyone criticized him
 vah naa to naaballig tha or naa hi baccha, lekin chunki vah is maamle se jude hue the, isliye sabhi ne un par hamalaa kiya
 After that a decision by the Supreme Court has made arrests in such cases more difficult

 SIT of Haryana Police has been given a severe blow by the court in Panchkula violence and Dera Sacha Sauda case
 adaalat ne 53 aropiyon par lagaai gai deshadroh or hatya kii koshish dhaaraon ko hataane kaa farmaan sunaaya he
 After this, the question is arising whether the Haryana Police is paying the revenge of the kindness of Gurmeet Ram Rahim on the government in this way
 nahin lee thi grih vibhaag se ijajatis maamle main sabase bada kanoonee pech ye he ki haryana police ne aropiyon par deshadroh kaa maamla darj karne se pehle centre or rajya sarkaar ke grih vibhaag se ijazat nahin lee thi
 Therefore, after the court's decree, the question arose whether the police deliberately did not allow the Center and the state government to file a sedition case to save the culprits? It is also important that 53 failed to prove treason against the dera lovers
 Will the police prove Honeypreet guilty? It now appears that the investigation into the Deadera Sacha Saudhimsa case deliberately ignored the facts
 jisaki vajah se haryana police kii fajihat ho rahi he
 Police failed in court The Haryana police, which failed to stop thousands of Dera supporters from entering Panchkula last year, has now failed to prove treason charges against the disciples of Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who was arrested on charges of violence
 vajah he ki haryana police ke aalaa adhikariyon ne deshadroh kaa maamla darj karne se pehle na to haryana or na hi centre sarkaar ke grih vibhaag se ijazat lee
 Second, the SIT could not even give evidence in the court to prove charges of treason
 yahi nahin court ne deraa ke badmaashon par dhara 307 ke tahat aarope maanane se bhi inkaar kar diya
 On the other hand, petitioner Ravinder Dhulla, the petitioner in the Dera violence case, has accused the police of willful laxity
 dhull ke mutabik police ne jaan boojhkar grih vibhaag se ijazat nahin lee taaki cese ko kamjor bana saken
 The police has also received reprimand before that due to flaws in the investigation, the Haryana Police has got reprimand from the High Court bench too
 police adhikariyon ne dere se baahar cash or doosraa keemtee saamaan le jane vaale balraj se bhi poochtacha nahin kii thi
 Not only this, despite the issuance of warrant against the chairperson of the Dera, Vipassana Man, he was not arrested
 hinsa ke maamle main aaj tak gurmeet ram rahim ko police aaropee nahin bana saki
 This is the reason that questions are being raised on the intention of the Haryana government and the police
 court ne sunaaya tha ye farmansomvaar kii subah panchkula hinsa or aagjanee ke maamalon kii sunwaayee kar rahi adaalat ne haryana police kii esaiti ko bada jhatka diya
 The court has ordered that the charges of sedition and attempt to murder against 53 accused be dropped from the FIR
 kyonki police ke paas in aaropon ko sabit karne ke liye paryaapt saboot nahin hai
 However, the court made it clear that the cases of sedition and criminal conspiracy against Hahnipreet Insan, Aditya Insan and others will continue
 jin aropiyon ke khilaaf darj deshadroh or hatya ke prayaas kii dharaaen hataane ko kaha gaya he, unamem panchkula deraa ke incharge chamkaur singh, pravaktaa surendra dhimaan sahit kul 53 aaropee shaamil hai
 The court said in its order that the police had also imposed Section 307 of the IPC against the accused, but the case of violence on August 25 does not prove that any policeman or other is in danger of life
 maamle kii jaanch kar rahi esaiti aropiyon ke khilaaf lagaae gaye deshadroh ke aarope bhi sabit nahin kar pai
 The defense lawyers had told the court that the police could not record CCTV footage related to the case or present facts that could prove treason charges
 bachaav paksh ke vakil suresh rohilla ke mutabik aropiyon ke khilaaf ab panchkula kii chif jeudicial magistrate kii trial court main sunwaayee hogi
 This was the whole case that the violence erupted in Panchkula on 25 August last year after Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim was convicted in a rape case
 jisamen 34 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 In order to investigate these riots, the police had made more than 8 SIT teams and presented the challan in the court

 Earlier, when it was said that China has the largest army in the world with 23 lakh soldiers, it does not get puffed up, but now the thinking has changed

 He believes that it does not matter that India gets this fame

 Kind message was given

 India and the United States signed an important agreement that would make the two countries a close partner for defense equipment
 isse donon deshon kii sena marammat or supplai ko lekar ek duusare ke sainik thikaanon or jameen kaa istemaal kar sakengi
 It is clear that both countries have taken into consideration China's growing maritime power while making this agreement
 somvaar ko sajo-saamaan sambandhi aadan-pradaan samjhaute (lemoa) par hastakshar kiye jane kaa swaagat karte hue raksha mantri manohar parrikar or america raksha mantrieshton carterne kaha ki yah samjhauta vyavhaarik sampark or aadan-pradaan ke liye avasar pradaan karegaa
 The agreement will provide arrangements for logistical support, supply and service between the two countries' military
 donon deshon main majboot honge raksha sambandhsamjhaute par hastakshar ke baad jari saajha bayaan main kaha gaya, unhone is mahatv par jor diya ki yah vyavastha raksha praudyogiki evam vyapaar sahyog main nae or atyaadhunik avasar pradaan karegaa
 The US has agreed to expand defense trade and technology sharing with India to the level of Koniktam partners
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki donon deshon ke bich raksha sambandh unke saajha mulyon evam hiton par aadhaarit he
 The navies of the two countries will be able to easily do a joint exercise
 It has nothing to do with LEMOA building a military base in response to a question
 mul rup se yah ek-duusare ke bedon ko sajo-saamaan sambandhi sahyog uplabdh karaane, jaise eendhan kii aapurti karne se yaa saajha abhiyaanon, maanviya madad evam anya raahat abhiyaanon ke liye jaruri chijen uplabdh karaane se judaa he
 "basically it will ensure that the two navies can prove to be helpful to each other in our joint operations and exercises," he said
 samjhaute ke tahat sainya adde nahin banaae jaaengamerica raksha mantri ne kaha ki eliemoe donon deshon ko ek saath kaam karne main sakasham banane main behad mahatvapurn he
 Carter said that it makes it possible and easier for us to work together
 unhone kaha, yah puri tarah aapasi sahmati par aadhaarit he
 In other words, under this agreement, we provide each other with complete access and ease of connection
 yah kisi bhi tarah se sainya adde sthapit karne vaala samjhauta nahin he
 But this makes the supply of equipment connected to joint operations extremely easy
 yah samjhauta na sirf jaruri sahyog ko vittiya madad dene ke liye atirikt madhyam uplabdh karaata he, balki iske tahat alag-alag maamalon ke liye donon deshon kii sahmati bhi jaruri he

 ajam khan kii ore se pesh kapil sibbal ne kaha ki ajam ne aisa koi bayaan nahin diya tha ki gangrape raajnneetik sajeesh he

 This matter should be investigated supreme court ne kaha ki is tarah ke bayaan se koi bhi vyakti manahani kaa cese daakhil kar saktaa he, lekin rape cese main peedita janhit ke tahat bhi court aa sakati he
 This is not a case of inflammatory speech, it is a question of respect and pending investigation of the rape victim
 pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan ajam khan kii taraf se kisi ke bhi pesh nahin hone par supreme court ne naaraazgi jataai thi
 The court had said that he did not appear despite the issue of the notice, while someone should have appeared on his behalf
 tippaniyan In fact, Azam Khan had described the incident as a political conspiracy, after which the Supreme Court issued notice to the UP government and the state's Urban Development Minister Azam Khan, taking cognizance of the appeal of the gang rape victim's father
 supreme court ne ajam khan kii tippaniyon par upi sarkaar or ajam khan ko notice jari karte vakt fatkaar lagaate hue kaha tha ki kya prashasan yaa sarkaar ke ahm ohade par baitha vyakti yah kah saktaa he ki is tarah kii ghatnaayen raajnneetik sajeesh ke tahat hoti hai, jabaki ghatana se vyakti kaa koi lenaa-dena na ho

 The Supreme Court said that with such a statement, any person can file a defamation case, but in the rape case, the victim can also come to the court under public interest
 yah bhadakaau bhaashan kaa maamla nahin he, yah rape peedita ke sammaan or lambit jaanch par sawaal he

 According to the information, this Australian man of Malay origin has been identified as Ahmed Fahim bin Hamad Awang

 Awang was stopped for questioning when he took a flight from Perth to New Delhi's Indira Gandhi Airport

 China has put a halt to India's efforts to declare India's most wanted terrorist, Masood Azhar, a global terrorist through its veto power at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
 uski is harakat se bharat main khaasaa rosh he ki china ne dher saare saboot die jane ke baavjood masood ko kyon bachaaya
 This decision of China is not behind Pakistan's friendship but a fear that has always haunted it
 america, britain or france ne masood ajahar par pratibandh lagane ke liye sanyukt raashtra main prastaav rakhaa tha, lekin china ne antim samay main apni vito kii takat kaa istemaal karte hue masood ajahar ko chauthi baar bachaa liya
 What is his intention behind this decision of China, Aaj Tak is going to give you complete information on why he wants to save Masood Azhar and the jaish-e-mohammed terrorist organization in Pakistan? Yes, the inside story behind this is whether China is afraid of Jaish terrorists or is afraid of increasing terrorism in Ungihar province of China
 sipiisi project par hamale kaa darain donon sawaalon kaa uttar pakistan main maujuud aatanki sanghathan jaish or lashkar tak jaataa he
 First of all, let us tell you that the CPEC project of China not only goes through the gilgit-baltistan region but also passes through that area of pakistan occupied Kashmir and Mansehra district of Pakistan which falls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
 khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa vahi rajya he jahaan pichley dinon bhartiya air force ne balakot main jaish-e-mohammad ke training camp par air strike karke badi sankhya main aatankwaadiyon ko dher kiya tha
 In fact, this CPEC project of China passes through this area of khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) where a terrorist camp was present in Balakot
 nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he jaishachin ko is baat kaa dar sataata he ki agar usne masood ajahar par vaishvik aatanki ghoshit hone par roak nahin lagaai to kahin jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki uske sipiisi project main kaam kar rahe 12,000 se zyada chini nagarikon par hamalaa na kar de
 Due to this fear, China is probably not helping India and other countries to ban Masood Azhar
 vaise bhi china kii fitrat rahi he ki apana kaam jahaan banataa he vah sirf or sirf vahiin kaam karata he or yahi vajah he ki pakistan or paak adhikrut kashmir main china ke project jo pakistan main sipiisi ke jariye jate hai usko bachaane ke liye vah kisi had tak yani aatanki ko bhi madad karne main juta hua he
 Intelligence sources have informed Aaj Tak that a number of terrorist camps run in many areas including Mansehra, in which Balakot camp has now been destroyed
 jaish ke duusare campon main training paae aatanki chini ejeeniyar ke liye khatra ban sakate he
 Sources have informed Aaj Tak that China has recently purchased land for the CPEC project at several places near National Highway-15 near Balakot
 use dar he ki kahin jaish ke aatanki uske ejiniyaron ko agava na kar le
 Not only this, China is also building power projects in many places in Pakistan occupied Kashmir under CPEC project
 ajtak ke paas maujuud power project ke bare main jo jaankaree he
 According to him, many such power projects are passing through the area where Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has maintained a stronghold of terror
 lashkar ke hamale kaa daradrasal, paak adhikrut kashmir (pioke) main 1,100 megawatt kaa ban rahaa koharaa hydro power project ko china bana rahaa he saath hi karot hydro power project ko bhi china banane main juta hua he
 Not only this, 640 MW Azad Pattan and 640 MW Mahi Hydro Power Project is being built by China in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir
 sutron ne jaankaree di he ki china is baat se darataa he ki kahin pakistan ko agar usne khush nahin kiya to uski panaah main pal rahe aatanki masood ajahar or lashkar-e-taiyaba uske project par hamalaa na kar den jisase use bada nuksaan ho saktaa he
 At the same time, sources have also informed that China is also afraid that the manner in which lashkar-e-taiba-backed terrorists attack there in its Ungihar province is also afraid
 china yah chahta he ki pakistan ke jariye vah islamic world main apni pahunch bana le or aatankwaadiyon ko jis tareeke se radicalij karke china ke ungihaar praant main lashkar or duusare aatanki sanghathan bhej rahe hai usko bhi vah roak sake
 This is the reason why he does not want to unhappy Pakistan and its intelligence agency ISI and Pak Army in any way
 sutron ne ajtak koi jaankaree di he ki china ke ungihaar praant main aatank failaane ke peeche east turkmenistan independence movement yani itim kaam karata he jisko funding or logistic saport lashkar kii taraf se kiya jaataa he
 lashkar-e-taiba is Pakistan's first pet terrorist and China wants to reach Lashkar through Pakistan so that it can save the terrorist incident spreading in its province
 haalanki, ek sawaal saaf uthta he ki china aatank ko lekar jis tareeke se apana or paraayaa kar rahaa he aage chalakar use khaasaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 China is trying to rescue the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed, who attacked Pulwama in India, while it is entering Pakistan to save the terror spreading in its country
 china kii yah dohari chaal use kabhi na kabhi benakaab kar degi

 Tanushree Dutta- # metoo case in India has caught fire after Nana Patekar controversy
 ab tak kai mahilaon ne saamne aakaryon utpeedanke aarope lagaae hai
 Many names like Nana Patekar, Vivek Agnihotri, Sajid Khan, Vikas Bahl, Piyush Mishra, Alok Nath, and Rajat Kapoor have appeared
 ab is maamle memrenuka shahanebhi khulkar saamne ai hai
 Renuka tells the story of her mistreatment
 kya he maamla?renuka ne 'pinkavila' ko die ek intervyuu main apni aapbeetee saajha karte hue kaha, "main antakshri ke shoot ke liye noida gai thi
 i have done many outdoor shoots, so i got used to being alone in the room
 ""ek shaks mere kamare main room sarvice ke liye aayaa or mere saamne gandi harakat karne laga
 First he told me that he is a big fan of mine and i thanked him
 iske baad usne khaanaa rakhaa or gandi harakat kerani shuru kar di
 It was terrible
 maine turant hi usase baahar jane ke liye kaha or manager se shikaayat karne kii baat kahi""iske baad maine 'atanksharee' ke assistant ashvini ko kamare main bulaayaa
 i was badly shaken by this whole incident
 iske baad main kabhi bhi kamare main akele nahin rahi
 i always stay with my hairdresser
 unhone kaha ki logon ko lagata he ki industry main hi aise log hote hai lekin aise kai log hai jinase aapako baahar bhi nipatna hota he"bataa den ki naanaa patekar ke maamle main bolne ke baad ab renuka shahane nealok nathpar lage aaropon ke bare main bhi riection diya
 He played the daughter-in-law of Alok Nath in 'hum Aapke Hain Kaun'
 jab renuka ne alok nath ke maamle main koi bayaan nahin diya, to ek yujar ne unase kaha tha ki unki chuppi anuraag kashyap or tanmay bhatta se kaise alag he
 After this Renuka said- Because Tanmay and Anurag are the employers, i am not
 mere kisi impaloyi ne alok nath ke bare main shikaayat nahin kii he
 Deepika Amin had confided with me as a friend when i had completed two projects with Alok Nath
 How silly! Why would i apologise? Oh i guess you think i should apologise for NOT sexually molesting anyone, NOT raping anyone? i guess you want me to apologise for my solidarity with the women who are speaking up about their harassment? Get well soon!https: / / t
 co / bzx1crmout — Renuka Shahane (@renukash) October 11, 2018 After this, a user raised questions about what an apology this is
 is par renuko ne jawaab diya-"main kyon maafee maangoongi? mujhe lagata he ki aap soch rahe hai ki mujhe kisi ke saath chhedchhad yaa rape na karne ke liye maafee maangani chahie
 You want me to apologize for uniting with the woman who is raising her voice against her hares
 jaldi thik ho jaao
 " antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) ne test maichon, vanade international or tii-20 international maichon ke liye nobal kaa nayaa niyam lagu kiya he jiske tahat jab bhi gendbaaj gend karte samay nonstriker chor par wicket giraata he to ampire ko use nobal qaraar dena hoga
 This rule will come into effect from April 30 and under it the first international match will be played on May 3 between Zimbabwe and Bangladesh in Bulawayo
 isisi mahaprabandhak cricket jyoff alradise ne kaha, ‘abhi tak international maichon main jab bhi gendbaaj gend karte samay wicket giraata tha to use dead bal qaraar diya jaataa tha or is tarah kii sthiti se uchit tareeke se nahin nibata jaataa tha
 "he said," Merrillbone Cricket Club (MCC) recently decided to address the issue and from October 1, 2013, decided to implement the new rule of Nobel

 sansad bhawan main raashtrapati chunaav ke liye nomination kii prakriya buudhvaar se shuru ho gai
 So far about a dozen people have filed a nomination for the Presidential election and more than half a dozen people have taken the nomination form
 dilachasp yah he ki in logon main se koi bhi rajaneta yaa aisi pahunch vaala nahin he, jo is chunaav main vot hasil kar sake
 Just want a change of heart, which has brought them to Parliament
 haalanki jitne bhi nomination file kiye gaye hai, unka riject hona tay mana ja rahaa he
 The reason for this is that no nomination has 100 electors, 50 proposals and the necessary approvals, which are necessary for the Presidential election
 namakan bharne waalon main mumbai ke pati patni syra bano mohammad patel or mohammad patel abdul hamid bhi shaamil hai
 Both of them have filed separate nominations for this post
 iske alaava namakan bharne waalon main kanpur ke police vibhaag main kaam kar chuke mahesh chand sharma bhi shaamil he, jo isse pehle loksabhaa se lekarrashtrapati padke liye chunaav lard chuke hai
 He loses every time but still has the desire to win
 lihaaja jhola liye sansad bhawan ke chakkar kaat rahe hai
 Kishan Lal, who came from Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh, has a similar story
 peshey se vaidya kishan laal ko ummid he ki unhen upi ke netaaon se samarthan milegaa, to punjab ludhiana se aae bodhraj singh purv profesar hone ke naate desh ke yuvaaon main badlaav laane ke liye maidan main aa gaye hai
 Bodhraj is a devotee of Lord Rama and he is hopeful that Rama will cross his boat
 tamilnadu ke krishna reddy se dilli aae eliyas ne form to liya he, lekin unakochunavaki maujuuda prakriya se hi shikaayat he
 Because no common man is expected to win in this election
 isse bhi zyaada shikaayat is baat kii he ki chunaav namakan kaa form kaaphi pechida he
 Angered by this, Ilyas is also preparing to sit on Jantar Mantar regarding the issue of election form
 namakan kii yah prakriya 28 june tak chalegi or chatni 29 june ko hogi
 If necessary, voting will be held for the Presidential election on 17 July and then counting will be done on 20 July

 is desh main in dinon langik samanta par nae sire se bahes chal rahi he
 The current Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard is at the center of this debate
 julia kuch hi maheenon baad hone vaale chunaav main is mudde ko trump card ke taur par pesh kar rahi hai
 The debate has intensified over the controversy of his opponents in a fund raising party
 is party ke menu main ek dish kaa naam julia ke small breast or haivi thai tha
 However, he returns to the Dalai Lama
 vah 10 dinon ke daure par guuruuvaar ko australia pahunche
 During this time, on the issue of gender equality, he said that if the circumstances are such that it is better to have a female Dalai Lama then the female Dalai Lama will come
 gilard ke bayaan, ‘duniya main ek baar phir se langik yuddh ladaa janaa he’ par 77 saal ke nobel pis prise vijeta dharm guru bole ki ye sach he ki duniya asamanta ke ‘naitik sankat’ se jujh rahi he
 It needs leaders who can bring condolences to their posts
 apane tark ko or dhar dete hue dalai lamas ne kaha, ‘samvednaa kii baat karen, to jaivik rup se mahilaayein isamen zyada sakasham hoti hai
 They have greater sensitivity for the welfare of others
 agar main apana anubhav saajha karun to mere pita bahut gusse vaale rahe hai
 i was also beaten many times, but my mother was very compassionate

 Discussion between lyricist Javed Akhtar, poet Ashok Vajpayee and writer Anuja Chauhan in 'agenda Aaj Tak' session 'apne Bhashaon Hai Manti' was very meaningful
 bhashaa se nafrat karnaa galatakabir ko homer se bada shaayar bataate hue geetkaar or patakatha lekhak javed akhtar ne kaha ki hindi or angreji jaanane vaale ek-duusare kii bhashaa se nafrat karte hai or filmon main jabaan kii giravat kaa kaaran samaaj he
 In a linguistic session at the 'agenda Aaj Tak' conference, Javed Akhtar said, 'the tongues are rooted, Hindi is tense and the English are branches, through which the whole world can be reached
 magar nai peedi main bhashaa ke prati rujhaan kam hua he
 The situation is that one who knows English hates Hindi and one who knows Hindi hates English
 yah biimaar baat he, lekin sach he
 'shayari is very good in India', he replied to a question, 'shayari has been very good in India
 kabir bahut bade shaayar he, vah homer (greek kavi) yaa duniya ke kisi bhi kavi se bahut aage he
 At the same time, novels are well written in Europe
 hamaare yahaan premchand, tagore or sharatchand jaise kuch naamon ke baad ham ruk jaaenge, kyonki upanyaas likhane ke liye vakt chahie or hamaare yahaan kaa lekhak naukari ke saath likhata he, isliye vah kahani se aage nahin likh paata he
 Accepting the decline in language level in films, he said, "this is part of the society of films, where literature is almost over at home now
" is vakt gharon main sahitya kii kitaaben nahin milti or nai peedhee kaa sahitya se naata tut rahaa he
 Even the poet's conference has become a part of entertainment at this time
 ’javed sahab ne kaha, ‘bhashaa lipi main nahin likhi jaati balki kisi bhi bhashaa kaa aadhaar vyakaran hota he, jise kisi bhi lipi main likhte vakt galat nahin hona chahie
 i myself write in Urdu script, but people say you write very good Hindi
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘bhashaaen kabhi shuddh nahin hoti hai, kyonki urdu or hindi main nahin balki ham hindustani main likhte hai
 An attempt to purify a language at any time only hurts that language
 oxford kii dictionari main shabd badhate he, jabaki ham shabd kam kar rahe hai
 It is very difficult to write in easy language instead of writing in literary language
 ’suvidha ke anuroop banati he bhashaa: ashok bajpeyiis maukey par ashok bajpeyi ne kaha, ‘bhashaaen maulavee or pandit nahin banaate hai, balki aam naagarik apni suvidha ke mutabik bhashaa banaati he
 We are the largest multilingual country in the world, with 22 recognized languages of the constitution and 46 dialects of Hindi
 ’unhone kaha, ‘bhashaa kaa ganit bhi kuch had tak jaateey sameekaran jaisaa ho gaya he, jo angreji jane vah brahman or jo naa jane vah ‘shudra’
 It is good to know English, but you will find the language in your language, in which you dream
 angreji ke rob ke peeche nakli sachaai he
 He said that language limits should be open and English is the language of only a few percent of the people
 unhone kaha, ‘na angreji ko, na hindi ko kisi ko kisi bhashaa ko apdasth karne kaa koi haq nahin he
 'such should be the language, which makes sense: Anuja Chauhan On this occasion, Anuja Chauhan said that if languages are sick, they need to be given khichdi, that is, simplification is needed
 unhone kaha ki jab aap kitaab likhte hai, tab swaabhaavik bhashaa ke istemaal par jor hota he
 He said that there should be a language that we can understand
 unhone kaha ki aajkal ham hinglish kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 "seeing the seriousness of the incident, you are directed to send a report to the Commission immediately," Rahatkar wrote in the letter

 darasal, loksabhaa chunaav main modi sarkaar ke liye vipakshi dalon ko ekajute karne main chandrababu naidu ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi, lekin parinaam ke baad sab kuch khatm hota dikh rahaa he

 pichley saptaah ganguli ne shastri ke saath matbhedon kii atakalon ko kori afvaah bataaya tha
 Shastri said in India Today's program 'inspiration', 'as far as sourav-shastri is concerned, it is chilli masala like chaat and Bhelpuri for the media
 bhartiya coach ne kaha, ‘unhone (ganguli) cricketer ke taur par jo kuch kiya he main uskaa kaaphi sammaan karata hum
 'shastri said,' Ganguly took command of Indian cricket at the most difficult time after the betting episode
 aapako vaapasi ke liye logon kaa bharosa chahie hota he or main uskaa sammaan karata hum or agar koi iskaa sammaan nahin karata he to mujhe uski koi parvaah nahin
 Will Dhoni return, Shastri said - Anything after IPL The differences between Mumkinashtri and Ganguly became public in 2016 when Shastri applied for the post of coach and Ganguly was on the cricket advisory committee that chose Anil Kumble
 Was
 shastri ne bina kisi loktantric tareeke se teen saal tak board ke sanchaalan ke baad ganguli ke adhyaksh banane ko ‘shandaar’ qaraar diya
 He said, 'brilliant (becoming president of Ganguly)
 sabase pehle main is baat ko lekar romanchit hum ki bisisiai phir se astitv main he
 We played without BCCI for three years
 ’ Arvind Kejriwal is 'india Today Newsmaker of the Year 2013'
 iske liye aap 6 janvari 2014 ke india today megsine kaa ank aap dekh sakate hai
 India Today Managing Editor s Prasannarajan interacted with the Aam Aadmi Party leader
 arvind ne sarkaar ko lekar apane vichaar or yojanaayen bataayin
 Question: You have come to power with a street fighter
 is badlaav ko aap kis tarah dekhte hai?jawaab: jindagi mere liye ek samaan rahati he
 i have considered life to be fighting against injustice and corruption
 yah ladaai jari he
 Yes, its methods are definitely changing
 pehle hamane soochna kaa adhikaar ke liye abhiyaan chalaaya, phir hamane lokapal movement kiya or uske baad ek raajnneetik dal bana liya
 In this way the strategy is changing, but the fight against injustice and corruption continues
 sawaal: power main aane ke baad bhi aapkaa sangharsh jari rahane vaala he?jawaab: haa
 When you are in power, it depends on how you look at it
 agar power ek jimmedaari he to phir anyaay ke khilaaf jang jari rahati he
 But if power comes up, then it becomes a problem
 phir aap duusare ke liye samasyaayein paidaa karte hai or duusare aapke khilaaf ladane ke liye utar aate hai
 Question: Street Fighter's romance is now complete
 kya ab aap asli raajnneeti kii kadavi sachai ke liye taiyaar hai?jawaab: hamaare liye yah kabhi romance nahin tha
 There was a sense of responsibility at every step
 agar yah hamaare liye antic expirience hota to ham logon ne movement ke khatm hone ke saath hi sab kuch chhod diya hota
 When we formed a political party, many people understood that we are greedy for power
 tab hamaari chhavi daanv par lagi thi
 It would be wrong to say that there was romance then and now responsibility
 sawaal: vikendrikaran apane vichaar kaa mul he
 What are you going to do to make this happen? badahaal sansthaaon ko thik karne vaale hai yaa unhen hataa dene vaale hai
 Answer: Some institutions need to be strengthened, some institutions need to be built
 or kuch sansthaaen aisi bhi hai jinhen hataanaa padegaa
 Question: Can you elaborate? Answer: CAG and judiciary are very important institutions, they need to be strengthened
 kuch nae santhaan jaise ki lokapal, mohalla sabhaayen, ward sabhaayen banaae jane kii aavashyaktaa he
 And if there is any institution that has become useless, it should be removed
 philhal kisi vishesh ke bare main main nahin soch rahaa
 Question: Where and when did you get the idea of decentralization? Answer: It is a slow process
 jab main aruna ji (aruna roy) se mila tab maine 'soochna kaa adhikaar' ke bare main janaa
 Then it was 2001
 ham RTI par kaam kar rahe the
 At the same time, we faced many cases of corruption
 ham jab bhi kisi kaam ke liye sarkaar ke paas jate the, sarkaar kahati thi ki iske liye fund nahin he
 We again saw that in many western countries the participation of the common man is directly in the government and is very high
 antim faisla janata hi leti he
 After this, the whole idea came to my mind
 sawaal: maine aapaki kitaab 'swaraj' padhi
 Are both decentralization and swaraj the same? Answer: Yes, almost the same
 swaraj kaa matlab he ki logon ke paas khud par shashan karne kii shakti ho, yahi diarect demokrasi he
 It would be wrong to use decentralization
 isse lagata he ki power keval upree str par he
 In fact, power is at the bottom level
 ab samay aa gaya he ki top ke haath se power le lee jaae
 Question: Is your idea of swaraj inspired by Gandhi? Answer: Of course, we have read Gandhi
 hamane bahut se deshon ke anubhav se siikhaa he
 Not only this, there are many interesting experiences before the era of ancient and central India
 dekha ja saktaa he ki pracheen bharat main (british raaj se pehle) bhi chote-chote staron par diarect loktantr kaam karata tha
 Question: What is your vision about 21st century India? Answer: a society where people of every religion and caste live together in peace and equality
 ve ek duusare kii izzat karte hon
 All people should be well educated
 har koi is kaabil ho ki vah kama sake or apane parivaar kaa guzaara aasaani se kar paae
 i am not doing that everyone is very rich, but there should be enough that he can get good education and food
 sawaal: ab aap satta main aa rahe hai, to ab aap pratirodh ke vichaar or sarkaar kii vaastaviktaa ke bich santulan kaise saadhenge?jawaab: main iskar vibhaag main kaam kar chukaa hum
 There are many people with us who have worked in different fields
 hamaare paas bahut achche logon kaa mishran he
 So it is not that these people have been resisting all their lives
 sahi kahuun to ham ye bhi nahin sochate ki hamaare paas hi puraa dimag he or ham sab kuch badal denge
 We do not have a magic wand
 lekin hamen vishwaas he ki jab dilli main rahane vaale dedh karod log ek saath aaenge to har samasya kaa samaadhaan sambhav hoga
 We will change the definition of government
 ab dilli kaa har aadmi sarkaar hoga
 Question: If you look at the history of freedom movement too, it is difficult to maintain freedom by fighting for freedom
 kya aapako lagata he ki aapke liye mushkil samay aage aane vaala he?jawaab: yah ek badi jimmedaari he
 It is not just the responsibility but the kind of expectations that people have from us are very big and sometimes i really get scared
 maine apane sabhi vidhayakon se kaha he ki puri duniya kii nazren un par hai, agar unhone choti si bhi galati kii to itihaas unhen kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 Question: In most movements led by a person, whenever they come to power, there is always a danger of the supreme leader becoming the surveyor
 ummid karte hai ki aapke saath aisa na ho
 Answer: Decentralization is the answer
 agar mere paas hi bahut sari takat hogi to mujhe lagata he kal ko main abhimaani ho saktaa hum, sabaki pahunch se dur ho saktaa hum
 i may not be confused, but there may be many other loopholes
 chunauti yahi he ki sari shaktiyaan mere paas nahin honi chahie, shakti janata ke paas honi chahie
 Question: Till now there were big ideas like power decentralization and swaraj
 lekan prashasan main sab kuch dharaatal par hota he
 Answer: i completely agree with you
 or main aapako bataa duun ki hamane bhi kuch had tak detail main kaam kiya he
 For this we have enlisted the help of some very senior retired bureaucrats
 lekin ab sab kuch jhaadne kii jarurat he or ham bharosa dilaate hai ki dilli prashasan main achche adhikari system ko dizin karne main madad karenge
 It is not that we will make the perfect system at all, rather we will have to constantly change it
 yah ek nirantar gatisheel prakriya hogi
 Question: Have you ever imagined such a moment? Answer: i never thought in my life that i would contest elections and form a political party
 sawaal: kya aap dharm main vishwaas rakhte hai, kya aapako karm main vishwaas he?jawaab: haa main karm main vishwaas rakhata hum
 i was a believer in my childhood, i became an atheist when i went to IIT
 lekin pichley teen saalon main main ek baar phir se ishwar main vishwaas karne laga hum
 Because a movement that became a very big movement, then i realized how small we were
 ye hamaari vajah se nahin tha, jarur koi parloukik shaktiyaan iske peeche thim
 Question: So there have been some changes in you too? Answer: Of course, this is a continuous journey for us
 yah ek aadhyatmik yatra he
 Question: By what nature are you a person, nature, inspiration or logic? Answer: You cannot just walk with inspiration or enthusiasm and you cannot always be logical because the kind of work we are doing is based on enthusiasm and nature and nature
 And emotions have an important role in it
 jab aap chizon kii yojana banaate hai to tark kaam karte hai
 Question: What kind of book do you like to grow after a very busy day? Answer: i have not read any book for the last few years
 maine aakhri baar bhagwad gita padhi thi
 i do not have any time at all
 subah jab main morning walk ke liye jaataa tha to bhajan sunata tha, lekin ab to vah bhi chhot gaya he
 Question: Given your passion for the referendum, is this a sign of things to come? Whenever some big decisions have to be taken, will you hold referendum every time? Answer: Obviously you cannot run a government through referendums
 lekin saal main ek baar, do saal main ek baar jab kabhi koi bada nirnay lenaa hoga, mujhe lagata he janata se raay jarur leni chahie
 Question: In democracy, do you think consensus is the best way to make important decisions? But a leader can also take unpopular decisions for the benefit of the public
 to kya aap aise jaruri nirnay nahin lenge
 Answer: Some people believe that unpopular decisions cannot be taken by referendum or public opinion
 main isse sahamat nahin hum
 They have no idea how the public works
 hamane aisi kai saarvajanik baithkon kaa aayojan kiya he or unamem behad alokapriy faisle liye gaye hai
 Its only condition is to honestly present all the good and the bads of the issue to the people
 sawaal: kabhi aap gandhivadi kii tarah baat karte hai or kabhi communist lagate hai
 Answer: Actually we are very ordinary people
 ham samaadhaan chaahate hai
 We have our own problems
 hamen pani kii samasya he, bijli kii samasya he, sadak kii samasya he, shiksha or swasthya kii bhi samasya he
 If our problems are solved in a communist way, then we will find a solution from there and if our problems are solved in a socialist way, then we will find a solution from there
 ham kisi bhi tarah se samasyaon kaa samaadhaan chaahate hai
 Question: You have been a symbol of an ordinary person
 kya ab saadhaaran vyakti bane rahanaa ek boj jaisaa hoga
 Answer: i do not think it is a burden
 mujhe lagata he aap kya hai yah aapke andar he
 It is impossible for me to become someone else

 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has come clean on the matter of supporting the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections on the Ram temple issue
 sanghathan ke kaaryakari adhyaksh alok kumaar ne apane bayaan par safai dete hue kaha ki congress ko samarthan kaa koi prastaav nahin diya gaya he
 VHP does not support any political party
 saath hi unhone kaha ki ram mandir mudde par sabhi dalon kaa samarthan juta rahe hai
 Earlier, he had said that the Congress would consider support if it included the Ram temple issue in its manifesto for the Lok Sabha elections
 alok kumaar ne kaha, 'ram mandir ke liye jinhone khule taur par vaada kiya he, agar congress ghoshnaa patr main shaamil kare ki mandir banaaenge to uske (congress) ke bare main bhi vichaar karenge
 The restriction that it has imposed that the RSS volunteers cannot go to Congress should be withdrawn
 keval janeu pahanane se nahin hoga
 In the first week of the new year, Congress President Rahul Gandhi made a big statement about the construction of Ram temple
 unhone kaha tha ki ayodhya ram mandir kaa masalaa abhi court main he
 He also said that in Lok Sabha elections, issues related to jobs and farmers will be important
 ajtak se baatcheet main rahul ne kaha tha, 'ram mandir kaa maamla court main he, lekin 2019 ke chunaav main naukari, kisaanon kii chintaa, bhrashtachar jaise masalon par ahm honge
 Meanwhile, this statement of the VHP was also being considered a big blow to the BJP
 kayaason ke bich yah bhi kaha gaya ki viechpi kaa bijepi par se mandir masale ko lekar vishwaas dagamagaa rahaa he
 This can be gauged from the statement of Alok Kumar
 unhone kumbh main centre kii modi sarkaar par ishaare-ishaare main nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha, 'ab hamako aisa lag rahaa he ki sarkaar kii majaburiyaan kya he wo to ham nahin jaanate, lekin sambhavat: is sarkaar ke is kaarykaal main kanoon aane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 We will put all the circumstances of the country in front of the saints and ask what to do next
 sant jaisaa maargdarshan karenge is abhiyaan ko aage badhayenge
 Let me tell you that the possibility of a temple being built immediately before the general election is not much
 'haalanki ab alok kumaar ne safai pesh karte hue kaha he ki viechpi ne congress ko samarthan kaa koi prastaav nahin diya he
 Explain that after the opening of the temple locks by former Prime Minister and senior Congress leader Rajiv Gandhi, a large number of people and Hindu organizations came with him
 jiske baad congress jameen se lekar sansad tak majboot hui thi
 In such a situation, if the Congress opens its doors for the Ram temple and incorporates the temple issue keeping in mind the vhp's talk in its manifesto, then the BJP may suffer a big loss in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 ram mandir ko lekar kangras dhimi aawaaj main hi sahi lekin masale par samarthan karti rahi he
 Recently, senior Congress leader from Uttarakhand Harish Rawat said that the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya will be done only after the Congress comes to power
 ravat ne kaha tha, 'humlog nitiyon or samvidhan main aasthaa rakhte hai
 The Ram temple in Ayodhya will be built only when the Congress government is formed at the Center
 yah pakki baat he
 At the same time, Uttar Pradesh Congress President Raj Babbar recently said that where else would the Ram temple be built in Ayodhya
 haalanki, unhone yah bhi kaha, 'ayodhya main mandir kahaan banegaa, yah faisla court main hi tay ho saktaa he
 He said that who does not want to take the temple of Lord Rama
 chaahe wo hindu ho, muslim ho, sikh ho yaa isaai
 Everyone wants a Ram temple built
 'pradhanmantri narendra modi ne haal ke apane intervyuu main ram mandir masale par kaha tha ki ye maamla abhi court main he, aise main sarkaar nyaayik prakriya puraa hone kaa intjaar karegi
 At the same time, Bhaiyyaji Joshi of the RSS has come after the statement in which he talked about completing the temple construction process by 2025
 joshi ne kaha tha, 'hamaari ichha he ki 2025 tak ayodhya main ram mandir ban jaae
 i did not talk about starting in 2025, if started today, it will be made in 5 years
 ' Let me tell you that before this, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan held a press conference on the terror attack in Pulwama
 unhone pulavama kii ghatana main pakistan kaa haath hone se inkaar karte hue kaha ki bina kisi subut ke kyon jimmedaar tehraaya ja rahaa he
 He said that what is the benefit of Pakistan from this incident
 jab pakistan sthirataa kii ore ja rahaa he
 When thousands of Pakistanis have been killed due to the war
 phir aisi ghatana se pakistan ko kya phayda he
 Imran Khan said that no one went there and attacked us from our land
 phir bhi kisi kism kii aap tahakikat karnaa chahen to ham taiyaar hai
 If you give proof of Pakistan's involvement, then i guarantee that i will take action
 imran khan ne yah bhi kaha ki agar bharat yuddh karegaa to pakistan sochega nahin balk jawaab degaa
 Because Pakistan will have no other option than this
 unhone kaha ki ham sab jaanate hai ki yuddh shuru karnaa aasaan he, yah insaan ke haath main he, magar yuddh khatm karnaa insaan ke haath main nahin hota
 This issue will eventually be resolved by Dialogue
 desh main sculo main bacchon kii peetane par purna pratibandh ke babajood skulon main bacchon kii nirmam pitayee ke maamle rukne kaa naam nahin le rahe hai
 One such recent case is at Portmore, Kanye Government School, Shimla, where a dance teacher beat a student with a stick just because she had done a wrong step in dance during a rehearsal before a competition
 ghatana ke baad peedit chaatra kaa parivaar behad gusse main he or aaropee teacher ke khilaaf sakht karwai kii maang kar rahaa he
 Family members have registered a case in Chhota Shimla Thane
 police dwaara peedit chaatra kaa medical karavaaya ja rahaa he or aaropee adhyapika ke khilaaf maamla darj kar diya he
 While the government across the country has enacted a stringent law to ban the beating of children in schools, even now many teachers, regardless of this law, do not shy away from needlessly beating children
 shimla main bhi kanya vidhyalay portmor kii aathvin kaksha kii chaatra kii usee ke skool kii dance teacher ne danda se peetai kar di
 The student's mistake was only that she had made a step wrong in the ongoing dance rehearsal before the competition in Solan
 bas ye dekhte hi aaropee dance teacher kaa paara saatven aasmaan par chadh gaya or usne chaatra ko danda se peetna shuru kar diya
 Several wounds occurred on the body of the student due to beating
 ghatana ke baad peedit chaatra ke parijanon ne aaropee teacher ke khilaaf sakht karwai kii maang kii he
 The parents allege that their daughter has been beaten up by the dance teacher
 abhibhavakon kaa kahana he kii wo apane bacchon ko skool main sirf padhne bhejte he jabaki dance teacher apni marji se hi unki bachche ko pratispardhaa ke liye apane saath le gayi thi
 On the other hand, the Shimla Police has started a investigation by registering a case against the accused teacher
 shimla ke es pi abhisheekh dullar kaa kahana he kii skool main kisi bhi bachche kii pitayee par bain he lihaaja kaanoon ke mutabiq aaropee teacher par karwaai amal main laai ja rahi he
 The victim student is undergoing medical treatment
 vahin himachal pradesh shiksha vibhaag ke mukhya sansadeey sachiv kaa kahana he kii abhibhavakon dwaara unhen is maamle kii jaankaree nahin di gayi he
 But after the matter comes to notice, the government will take strict action against the accused teacher
 udhar skul prabandhan bhi maamle ko lekar kuch bhi nahi kah rahaa he or aaropee adhyapika bhi media ke saamne nahin aa rahi he

 sanyukt raashtra main unhone jo bhaashan diya or duniya ke bade netaaon ko khuli chunauti de daali, usapar bhi charchaa jari he

 (mailtoday
 sincerely) paanch saal pehle supreme court ne sibiai ko 'pinjre main band tota' or 'maalik kii awaz' bataaya tha
 In 2014, there was a change in political leaders at the center, but despite the big claims of bringing democracy and transparency in the system, there is no change in the functioning and functioning of this leading investigative agency of India
 centre kii sattadhari partiyon par pehle bhi apane raajnneetik hit saadhane ke liye kendriya jaanch agenciyon ke durupyog ke aarope lagate rahe hai
 There have been many such occasions during the Modi government's tenure of more than four years at the Center, where he was accused of using the CBI to extract his interests and political hatred
 kul milakar aisa kabhi nahin laga ki centre kii modi sarkaar bhi CBI ko pinjre se aaazaad karne kii manshaa rakhti he
 Rather, there were many such occasions when Modi government took decisions related to the CBI by following the rules and used the CBI arbitrarily
 modi sarkaar par raajnneetik badale kii bhaavana se bhi sibiai ke istemaal ke aarope lage
 Let us know what those occasions came during this four-year tenure of the Modi government, when the Modi government stood in the dock over control of the CBI
 rakesh asthana kii CBI main special diarector ke pad par niyukti1984 batch ke gujarat coder ke ipies afasar rakesh asthana ko sibiai main special diarector niyukt kiye jane ko lekar modi sarkaar par niyamon ke viruddh jaakar apni pasand ke vyakti ko sibiai main bithaane ke aarope lage
 Please tell that Rakesh Asthana's image is of a tainted officer
 un par 4,000 karod ke mani londrig maamle main sanliptata ke aarope hai, jisaki jaanch khud sibiai kar rahi he
 Rakesh Asthana is considered to be special of Modi and Amit Shah and despite being a junior officer, the case of making Rakesh Asthana a special director of CBI went to the Supreme Court
 rakesh asthana kii niyukti ko lekar uth rahe sawaalon par tab muhar lag gai, jab unhen sibiai kaa kaaryakari nideshak niyukt kar diya gaya
 When this appointment was challenged in the Supreme Court, he was removed and a regular director was selected
 majaburi main kii gai sibiai pramukh kii niyuktianil sinha ke ritair hone ke baad kareeb ek saal tak sibiai pramukh kaa pad khaali rahaa
 Meanwhile, Modi, who was made special director and Rakesh Asthana, close to Shah, was looking after the work of CBI chief as interim director
 darasal modi or shah rakesh asthana ko hi sibiai kaa antarim nideshak banaae rakhana chaah rahe the, lekin ek janhit yachika par supreme court dwaara jawaab talab ke baad dabaav main centre sarkaar ko dilli ke police kamishnar alok verma ko sibiai pramukh niyukt karnaa padaa
 The controversy over the appointment of Alok Verma also reached the Supreme Court
 alok verma ke paas sibiai yaa visilence vibhaag main kaam karne kaa anubhav na hone ke niyam hawala dekar unki niyukti ko chunauti di gai, lekin supreme court ne sabase varisht hone ke naate alok verma kii niyukti par muhar laga di
 CBI raids against Karti Chidambaram, arrests, raids and inquiries against Karti Chidambaram, son of senior Congress leader p Chidambaram, son of UPA-2 tenure 
 congress ne raajnneetik ranjish nikaalane ke liye karti chidambaram ko sibiai ke jariye pareshaan karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 In the Aircel Maxis deal case, CBI also arrested Karti Chidambaram and kept him in custody for 12 days
 bataa den ki sibiai ne ienex media cese main mani londring se jude maamle main karti chidambaram ko mukhya aaropee banaaya he
 However, many orders of the CBI have been overturned by the High Court and the Supreme Court
 NDTV par chhapemarimodi sarkaar main bhi sibiai kii har chaal raajnneetik rup se prerit hone kii bu maarthi rahi
 Even after the sudden raids at the residence of NDTV co-founders Pranab Rai and Radhika Rai, the Modi government was accused of taking action under personal enmity
 bataa den ki sibiai ne yah chhapamari 2010 main ICICI bank se news channel dwaara liye gaye 350 karod rupye ke karj kii adaayagi main kathith dhaandhlee ke sambandh main kii thi
 But the sudden raids for the first time in 7 years raised questions on the intent of the CBI, and the Modi government was accused of trying to suppress a television channel criticizing its functioning
 virbhadra singh ke 11 thikaanon par chhapemarihimachal pradesh ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti maamle main sibiai ke chaape ke vakt bhi centre kii bijepi sarkaar par satta ke durupyog kaa aarope laga
 Virbhadra is alleged to have committed around 6 from known sources of income in the name of his and family while he was a minister in the then UPA government between 2009 and 2012
 03 karod rupee zyada kii sampatti arjeet kii
 In this case, the CBI conducted raids on 11 of his targets on the day of the marriage of Virbhadra's daughter
 vahiin virbhadra or unki party congress ne in tamaam aaropon ko khaarij kiya or modi sarkaar par vidweshpurn dhang se karrwai kaa aarope lagaaya
 Kejriwal government and Center confrontation The Modi government was first accused of misusing the central agencies against the Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi
 dilli main aam aadmi party ke 10 se zyada vidhayakon ko police ne vibhinn aaropon main giraftaar kiya, vahiin mukhyamantri karyaalay tak par chaape kii khabar ai
 While Kejriwal's principal secretary Rajendra Kumar was arrested by the CBI on alleged corruption charges, Kumar alleged that the CBI pressured him to implicate Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a corruption case
 sharada-narda ke jariye mamata ko gherne kii koshishmodi sarkaar or bijepi ke chanakya amit shah ke liye nishchit taur par pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee kaa kila bhednaa in chaar varshon ke dauraan chunauti bana rahaa
 Several leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal came under the scanner of the CBI in the Saradha chit fund and Narada sting case and arrested several prominent leaders including state transport minister Madan Mitra
 narda maamle main sibiai ne tiemasi ke 12 mantriyon or netaaon ke khilaaf aarope darj kiya
 At the same time, Mamata Banerjee accused the BJP of using the CBI and ED to try to bully her party
 mamata kaa aarope he ki unki party ne bhagava party ke khilaaf bolne kaa saahas dikhaaya, isliye uske saath aisa kiya ja rahaa he
 The manner in which the CBI initiated swift actions against each member of his family after the Lalu family's case JD (U) broke alliances with the RJD and returned to power in the fodder scam case
 , That too is being seen as a revenge policy of the Modi government
 balki yahaan tak kaha gaya ki centre sarkaar ke ishaare par sibiai dwaara banaae gaye dabaav ke chalate hi nitish kumaar ne lalu se apana gathbandhan todaa
 Lalu's son and former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi termed the FIR of corruption lodged against him as a political conspiracy of the BJP
 unhone kaha ki amit shah or piem modi kii shah par yah sab ho rahaa he
 Overall, during the tenure of the Modi government, during which these four years, the CBI acted at very quick pace in select cases and in some cases kept its old elephant speed, it gave an opportunity to the opposition and a large section of the countrymen to say It was found that the Modi government also wants to control the CBI in the same manner as the allegations were made during the Congress tenure
 congress ko aaj uttarakhand main vidroh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Senior party leader Harish Rawat's camp made it clear that he would not give up his candidature for the post of Chief Minister but vowed that he would fight this battle within the party itself
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki mukhyamantri pad ke liye daavedaari ko khaarij kiye jane ke baad ravat ne apane samarthak vidhayakon ke saath baithak kii jisamen bhavi karrwai kii ranneeti taiyaar kii gai
 At that meeting, a large number of mlas were present in Uttarakhand out of the party's 32 mlas
 vijay bahuguna ke shapath grahan samaaroh se ravat samarthakon kii gaiyr maujuudagi se aisa samajha jaataa he ki congress chintit he
 One of the newly elected mlas said that the new government would not last 10-15 days
 harish ravat ne aaj raat samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki unki congress chhodane kii koi yojana nahin he lekin mukhyamantri pad par apane daawey ke liye ladaai jari rakhenge
 In response to many questions, he said, 'I am a Congress worker and will demand redress of my grievances within the Congress platform
 ’ haalanki, unhone apni bhavi karrwai ke bare main bataane se inkaar kar diya
 However, senior party leader and MLA Harak Singh Rawat, who is supporting Rawat, clearly stated, 'the future of the new government in Uttarakhand is very bleak
 yah sirf 10-15 din chal sakati he
 Opposing Bahuguna, Harak Singh Rawat said, "he has no contribution in the state and has been imposed on us
" ’ gauratlab he ki bahuguna ko aaj shaam uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri ke taur par shapath dilaai gai
 He said that Harish Rawat played a big role in the victory of Congress in the Uttarakhand Assembly elections
 harish ravat ke kareebi sutron ne bataaya bahuguna ke shapathgrahan samaaroh main mahaj 10 ke kareeb congress vidhayakon kii maujuudagi ne is baat kii pushti kar di ki vah vahaan par party ke ‘asli netaa’ hai
 There was speculation that Harish Rawat met BJP President Nitin Gadkari on Monday night but this was denied by another supporter of Rawat, MP Pradeep Tamta
 kendriya mantri gulam nabi aaazaad ne in atakalon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki vah kabhi soch nahin sakate ki ravat gadakari se milenge yaa kisi anya party main jaaenge
 Azad, who was in charge of the party's state affairs, announced Bahuguna's name as chief minister
 aaazaad ne kaha, ‘vah (ravat) patibaddh congress kaaryakarta hai or congress main bane rahenge
 He is a member of the Union Council of Ministers and has to contribute there
 ’ Virat Kohli, who played a key role in India's 21-run victory in the first ODI cricket match against Sri Lanka, said that wearing an Indian jersey is the most inspiring for him
 kohli ne press conference main kaha, ‘jab main bharat kii jersey pahentaa hum to main kaaphi prerit ho jaataa hum
 This is a responsibility so i want to do my best
 ’pehle match main 133 gend main 106 ran kii pari khelkar paanch maichon kii shrinkhalaa main bharat ko 1-0 kii jeet dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale kohli ne kaha, ‘main bhaagyashaalee hum ki lagaataar acha pradarshan karne main safal rahaa hum
 It is to get out on the field and play to the best of your ability and try to get the best possible result
 ’kohli ne pehle vanade main apane kariyar kaa 12waan or is saal srilanka ke khilaaf teesraa shatak banaaya
 He said winds in Hambantota played a big role during the first innings
 kohli ne kaha, ‘raat ko gend balle se khilne ke baad kaaphi teji se ja rahi thi
 We made some mistakes in fielding because we have not played here before

 vaise record book yahi bataate hai ki harmison ko chhodkar anya tej gendbaajon kaa strike rate zyada rahaa he yani unhen wicket hasil karne ke liye zyada gendbaaji kerani padi
 Like other pitches in England, Old Trafford's temperament varies with the season

 By the way, the records are pointing out that the spin on the Old Trafford is heavy
 par pich curator hard or bounsi pich banane kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 These records force Mahendra Singh Dhoni to include r Ashwin in the playing XI
 haalanki, match ke pehle se barish ho jaati he to pich main tej gendbaajon ke liye bhi madad rahegi
