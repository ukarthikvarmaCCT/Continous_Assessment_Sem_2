 The third and decisive match of the three-match ODI series between Team India and England will be played at Headingley Stadium in Leeds on Tuesday evening from 5 pm

 Virat's eyes on the series win saw the team suffer an 86-run defeat at Lord's after registering an eight-wicket win in the first match at Nottingham, putting both teams at 1-1
 landan main jeet se england kaa isisi ranking main number ek vanade team ke rup main sheersh sthaan pakkaa ho gaya
 At the same time, a win for India at Headingley will reduce the gap and increase the confidence before the Test series starting on August 1
 bharat ne isse pehle tii-20 antarrashtriya maichon kii siries 2-1 se apane naam kii thi
 At the same time, the Indian team is doing well in bilateral ODI cricket

 vanade main england par bharat kaa dabadabaa barkarartim india ke liye yah england par vanade shreshthata sunishchit rakhane kaa ek or mauka hoga kyonki bharat ne 2011 ke baad is pratidwandvi team ke khilaaf dwipaksheeya vanade international siries nahin gavaai he

 India won the home series 2–1 in January 2017 and in the current series, the match will end on the same margin, regardless of which team wins
 haalanki england kaa tii-20 ke bajaay vanade main dabadabaa majboot he
 If we look at the last match, it revealed the weakness of India's 50-over format, which is somewhat hidden due to T20 cricket

 isse bhartiya team kii bhubaneshwar kumaar or jasprit bumraah par nirbharta bhi dikhi
 Given Bhubaneswar's performance in the previous tours of Sri Lanka and South Africa, India are missing them a lot in this ODI series and there is no official statement on their fitness or availability
 unhone duusare vanade se pehle lords par net par gendbaaji bhi kii or vah ubarne kii raah par hai
 But it remains to be seen whether he is included in the team in place of Kaul or Umesh Yadav in this decisive match
 middle order dabaav ke boj se ghira he, kyonki bharat chauthe number ke liye sthaayee khilaadi nahin dhund sakaa he
 However, for any successful one-day team, this place is the most important and for some time India has been struggling to find a solution for this place
 is siries main lokesh rahul ne chauthe number par vaapasi kii he
 His biggest test was at Lord's as he has been in a good rhythm for some time but he got out at zero
 bharat ke paas bench par dinesh karthik or shreyas ayyar maujuud hai
 However, the team management is unlikely to consider Karthik's name in front of Dhoni
 yah bhi digar ho ki pichhlaa vanade britain daure par sirf teesraa mauka tha jab dhoni ko middle order main ballebaaji kaa mauka mila, isse pehle unhone dublin or cardiff main tii-20 main ballebaaji kii thi
 Dhoni, however, has the support of both Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri, once again showing India's over-dependence on Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma
 pichley do satr main is tikdi ne bharat ke vanade ranon main kareeb 60 pratishat ran jutaaye hai or is praaroop main team kii lagaataar safaltaaon main aadhaar stambh ban gaye hai
 The strength and weakness of England will not only be an opportunity for England to improve their record against India, but also to win the toughest rival team in recent times will be important for the preparation of the World Cup
 jo root jahaan ran jutaney rahe hai, vahiin anya ballebaaj bhi kalai kii spin kaa behatar dhang se saamana kar rahe hai
 His biggest concern will be the form of all-rounder Ben Stokes
 yah samajha ja saktaa he ki haalia hemestring chot kaa asar vah ab bhi mahasoos kar rahe hai or apni kshamta ke anusaar nahin khel paa rahe hai
 But he will remain a part of the team
 timen is prakaar hai:england:eon morgan (captain), jesan roy, johny beresto, jose butler (wicketiper), moin ali, jo root, jaik ball, liyaam plunket, ben stokes, adil raashid, david vili, mark wood or james vince
 India: Virat Kohli (captain), Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Lokesh Rahul, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (wicketkeeper), Dinesh Karthik, Suresh Raina, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Shreyas Iyer, Siddharth Kaul, Akshar Patel, Umesh Yadav , Shardul Thakur, Bhuvaneshwar Kumar

 china ne beete 13 aktubar ko brahmaputra nadi (china main yaralung jangabo or arunachal pradesh main siyang) par bane apane pehle bade baandh kaa parichaalan shuru kar diya
 It is a 510 MW hydropower project built in the middle of the river at Jangmu, 140 km southeast of Lhasa, India has been concerned about the impact of the river's low flow
 nadi ke aakraamak pravaah ko silsilewar kai baandhon ke madhyam se tibet main hi baandh lene kii chini yojana kii yah mahaj shuruyaat he
 Zhang Boating, deputy secretary general of the Chinese Society of Hydropower Engineers, an influential Chinese hydropower advisory group, believes the Brahmaputra River is the country's last hope for China's vast energy needs
 jhang kehete hai, ''yah nadi akele do thri gorges jaise baandhon ko chalaane kii takat rakhti he
 Three gorges are the world's largest dam with an energy potential of 22
 5 gigawatt he or jise china ne yangtsi nadi par banaaya he
 If Zhang's hypothesis is proved to be true, China will implement its most ambitious hydroelectric project in the coming decade, which will be bigger than the Three Gorges in capacity and size
 yah 38 gigawatt kaa ek vishaal baandh hoga jise brahamaputra ke great bend yani us hairatnaak darre main nirmit kiya jayega jahaan bharat kii ore mudiye se pehle yah nadi kareeb 1,000 meter kii oonchai se garajati hui girti he
 Officials in India and China, including hydropower experts, say that the Zangmu dam will have minimal impact on the river's lower flow, as the project is built 'in the direction of the river's flow' which does not have a huge reservoir and diverts its flow Has not gone bharat ke liye chintaa kaa vishay haalanki is nadi par banane vaale ve baandh hai jinaki yojana chini companiyon ne taiyaar kar lee he
 It is understandable from the proposals made by the Chinese government and government hydropower companies regarding new dams and interviews with Beijing officials and experts that now the government has agreed to move forward on projects that have been costing heavily in the past or Was considered technically challenging

 The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), government of the Tibet Autonomous Region, in March approved a plan to develop hydroelectric projects that included three projects on Yarlung Zangbo: one, a 640 MW project to be built at Dago before Jangmu Dam, the second dam will be an estimated 500 MW in Jishu and the third relatively small dam will be built in Jiyasha of 321 MW (see Not graphic)

 Their responsibility has been given to Gezhuba Group, a state-run hydroelectric company in Wuhan, central China
 china kii sarvocch yojanakaar sanstha neshnal deveopment and riforrm kamishan ke ek purv adhikari bataate hai ki gesuba ke adhikari china kii us paryaavaran niamak sanstha ke mukaable kahin zyada taqatvar hai jo baandhon ko manjuuri detii he
 On its website, Gezhuba has mentioned its ambitious plan in Tibet with respect to such projects, including projects on the Great Bend ie Motau or Medog

 The details of the new dam published on the website of Gezuba shows that the company is more excited to build a hydroelectric power station in Motau and has already raised two billion yuan (about Rs 2,000 crore) in this dam of Motau
 ) kaa nivesh kiya hua he jo ki jangabo kii mukhyadhara main nahin balki usase judi ek upadhara par sthit he
 Ghezuba anticipates that all four units will be operational by the end of this year
 jhang kehete hai ki ''samoochee yaralung jangabo par'' baandh banane kii jarurat he
 This will "help better manage water, generate more electricity and cut greenhouse gas emissions by using less fossil fuels"
 According to him, hydroelectric projects can deliver as much energy as 250 million tons of coal
 Meets with ve kehete hai, ''china utsarjan main katautee karnaa chahta he, to iskaa rasta panbizli hi he
 The production of wind energy in China is the highest in the world, but it is only one sixth of the energy generated by hydropower
 '' or prastaavit motau baandh se 10 karod ton koyale ke baraabar urja hasil hogi
 The impact on low flows is concerned with China's proposed plans on the Brahmaputra in India's north-eastern states, especially Assam and Arunachal Pradesh

 "I had never seen such a catastrophe," says 51-year-old Oyen Moyang, who farms 21 miles along the Siang River in Pasighat
 '' moyang kii jindagi kaa doosraa aashcharya march 2012 main saamne aayaa jab unhone paaya ki unke kheton ke kareeb siyang suukh gai thi

 unhone saarvajanik taur par yah bayaan de daalaa ki tibet main china ke banaae baandhon ke chalate arunachal pradesh main aane vaale pani ko roak liya gaya tha
 Experts, however, differ on how China's comprehensive plans will affect the farming of India and Bangladesh at the bottom of the river
 philhal china kii nadi kaa pani modeye kii koi yojana nahin he jabaki ise lekar chintaaen lagaataar jaahir kii jaati rahi hai
 China's planners have long talked about adding a western route to the ambitious "south to North Water Diversion Project" that would allow 40 billion cubic meters of the Yangtze River's water to be transported to the dry regions of the north, though elsewhere in the plan Also Yarlung Zangbo is not included
 iity rudki main jal sansaadhan vikaas evam prabandhan vibhaag ke professor nayan sharma kehete hai, ''baandh banaakar brahmaputra nadi ko sukha dene kii chini yojana vaali baat tab tak sahi nahin hogi jab tak ki in prastaavit pariyojnaon kaa istemaal panbizli jaise gaiyr-upbhog vaale upyogon tak simit rakh jayega
 "he estimates that 40 per cent of the annual flow to the Brahmaputra comes from the water harvesting sector in China, but there is no consensus on this figure and the Sharma estimates and figures need to be" adequately certified "
 Emphasize so that it can be decided that "how much flow from China is our dependence
" '' bharat kii seemaa main aane vaali brahmaputra kii sahaayak nadiyaan bhi is pravaah main yogadan detii hai
 Big dams versus small dams, officials say that dams such as the Zangmu built in the direction of the river's flow will have minimal impact on its downstream flow, although China will implement its plans to build several dams, especially the Great Bend Dam
 , It will undoubtedly be seen to have a long-term impact on the entire ecosystem of the river, including the lower flows
 uniwarsity of british colombia main tibeti jal sansadhano ke jaankaar tashi sering kehete hai ki dagu, jishu or jiyasha pariyojnaon ke maamle main china jaisi teji dikhaa rahaa he, vah 'khatarnaak' he
 He says, "it has been a few years since these projects started and they have reached the middle stream
 dhire-dhire ye or neeche jaaengi or aakhikar great bend tak pahunch jaaengi
 "they say that building a dam in the direction of river flow on the Great Bend will also have a" huge impact "
 unke mutabik, ''great bend par baandh banane kaa kul makasad yah he ki kam duuri main nadi kii oonchai main aane vaale teevr dhalaan kaa dohan kiya ja sake
 Obviously for this water has to be stopped and reservoir has to be made

 "beijing's planners claim that these dams are being built for power generation and not for diverting or collecting the stream of water, so there will be no adverse effect on the lower flow
" jhang kehete hai, ''ye baandh bharat ke liye laabhakaari sabit honge
 This will create a balance in the amount of water that will reduce the flow during the flood months while increasing during the drought months
 '' apni baat ko pusht karne ke liye ve america kaa udhaaharan dete hai jisane canada ko apane hiton ke chalate colombia nadi ke upree hisse main baandh banane ko kaha tha
 Officials of the Ministry of Water Resources of India also claim that the only way to stop the devastation caused by floods in Assam is to build a dam on the Brahmaputra

 Independent experts say that India should explore the potential of hydroelectricity for its energy needs, but the best way to build an environmentally fragile area like the Northeast is to build small multi-purpose dams there

 While India is constantly pushing China to provide more information at the diplomatic level through its expert-level system, a reality is that in the absence of any water sharing treaty, India has future projects Stopping routes are also limited

 India did not vote on this treaty
 jal sansaadhan mantralay ke adhikari maanate hai ki bharat jaanata he ki vah china ko jangabo par or baandh banane se roak nahin saktaa
 That is why its plan is to build its dams in Arunachal Pradesh as against China's dams, which India estimates has a total capacity of 54 GW

 "india will be able to sell power to Myanmar and Bangladesh," says a ministry official
 isse donon deshon ke saath kootnithik or aarthik rishton ke sandarbh main china ke mukaable use badhat mil sakegi
 "but India will have to wait at least until the 2016 Assam Assembly elections to start such projects
" yahaan ateet main baandh virdohi pradarshan ho chuke hai jinke chalate assam-arunachal kii seemaa par subansiri nadi par ban rahe 2,000 megawatt ke baandh kaa kaam puri tarah thap ho chukaa he
 Prior to the last Lok Sabha election, the BJP had opposed dam construction
 haalanki pichley saal jab kendriya urja mantri piyush goyal ne kaha tha ki baandh kaa nirmaan kaary puraa hona centre sarkaar khud sunishchit karegi to rajya main bijepi kaa netritv asantusht ho gaya tha
 The BJP would not like to raise the issue again as people have split in two parts on the environmental impact of the dams being built on the rivers
 assam bijepi ke ek sheersh netaa kehete hai, ''2016 ke chunaav ke baad satta main aane par ham baandhon ke paksh main janata kii raay kaayam karenge
 Till then we will not touch this delicate issue
 ''sharma kehete hai ki uttar-purv ke bijli sankat se jujh rahe rajyon ko hone vaale jaahir laabh ke alaava bharat ''antarrashtriya kanoon ke antargat is praavdhaan se bhi avgat he ki duusare desh ke saath saajha kudarti sansadhano par ek desh kaa haq zyada majboot mana jaataa he yadi vah pehle hi in sansadhano kaa istemaal kar rahaa ho
 China first started using Brahmaputra water
 agar bharat ne iske pani ke upyog par apana daawa thokane main teji nahin dikhaai, to vah antarrashtriya kanoon ke tahat jal bantwaare par baad main hone vaali bahason main pichad jayega
 "there is definitely a danger in such an initiative," says Sering
 bharat agar baandh banane laga to china apni pariyojnaon kii gati or tej kar degaa
 India will be left behind due to past record of settling such projects in China
 ve kehete hai ki aisa karne se bangladesh ko bhi ham naaraaz kar denge or china ke saath brahmaputra ghati ke sambandh main yadi ham ek sanyukt prabandhan pranali viksit karnaa chaahate hai to usamen bangladesh kaa samarthan behad ahm hoga
 India has a better way to persuade China for more efficient management of international rivers
 sharma kehete hai, ''aam dharna yah he ki china jal bantwaare kii sandhiyaan nahin karata he
 But she has signed with Mongolia, North Korea, Russia and most recently in 2011 with Kazakhstan
 aisi sandhiyon ke nishpaadan main kisi antarrashtriya madhyasthata kii jarurat nahin padi thi
 "dispute Settlement System" Brahmaddha Chelani, a professor of international studies and a professor of strategic studies at the Center for Policy Research, Delhi, says that India has a water treaty with all its neighbors besides China
 pakistan or bangladesh ke saath sandhiyon main vivaad nipataara pranali bhi shaamil he
 India alone is not concerned with China's plans
 mekong nadi par yunaan main ban rahe baandhon se thailand, laos, cambodia or vietnam bhi pareshaan hai
 These countries have formed the Joint Intergovernmental Mekong River Commission to manage the river
 pashchimi seemaa par kazakhstan ke saath china kaa vivaad to dashak bhar se zyada purana he jab ili or altish nadiyon par china kii pariyojnaon ke chalate nichali dhara main pani kam ho gaya or pradooshan kii samasya paidaa ho gai thi
 China initially ignored Kazakhstan's concerns, but later in 2011 signed a treaty
 yah sthiti donon deshon ke bich kareebi rishte ke kaaran ai kyonki ek to urja ke aayaat ke liye or duusare, shinshiyang ke seemaant praant main badhati aatankwaad kii samasya se nipatane ke liye use kazakhstan kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 This shows that China comes into action only when the matter is related to its interests

 If the government wants to take such a step in future, then it will have to improve some conditions first

 Digital transactions have to be designed to promote digital economy

 RJD says that due to the involvement of many parties in the alliance, it is ready to give up 5 to 7 seats
 usee anupaat main congress ko bhi balidaan dena chahie yani use bhi 7 yaa 8 siten hi milani chahie
 But the Congress wants to play on the front foot

 Congress says that we have strong candidates like Karti Azad to fight Darbhanga, Tariq Anwar is from Katihar, so there is no question of contesting fewer seats
 udhar jeethanram maanjhi kaa muqabla congress se hi he
 They say that we will not contest elections if there is no honorable agreement
 congress kii taraf se yah sanket baar baar aa rahaa he ki agar sammanjanak siten nahi mili to wo akele bhi chunaav maidan main utar sakati he

 unhen teen seat milani chahie jisamen ek kanhaiya kumaar ke liye begusarai ho
 However, RJD national vice president Shivanand Tiwari clearly said that no talks are being held with the Left

 The youth of the country is here
 rahul gandhi kahaan he
 i have also gone to Amethi to find them
 ek maheene se vahiin hum
 i went to Amethi thinking that it must have become like Paris
 manaregaa, jo unka dream project he, uski haalat amethi main hi sabase zyada kharaab he
 i never went to gather crowds
 itihaas gavaah rahaa he, ham kalakaaron ko kai baar netaaon se zyada tavajjo milti he

 Leaders lie more

 Where the party will say

 But that area comes in safe
 ham kisi shart ke saath raajnneeti main nahin aae
 We have come to make Narendra Modi the Prime Minister
 agar hamaare ladane se ek seat badhati he, to hamako khushi hogi
 Just wish that when there is a hand in making Modi the PM, then i should also be mentioned like a squirrel
 nagma:party haikaman kahegi, to chunaav laduungi
 Even if i say against a big leader, i will fight
 unhen tay karnaa he
 i am from Mumbai, i will first ask for a seat from there

 These people repeatedly attack Rahul and Sonia ji

 These people also come only by choosing
 raju shrivastaav:maine paise lekar bahut sari partiyon ke liye prachaar kiya
 For Congress
 bijepi ke liye
 For all parties
 tab main raajnneetik nahin tha
 i needed the money
 ghar nahin tha
 The car installment was also to be filled
 tab main samajhataa tha ki tent, kursi, sound lite kii tarah hum
 The party whose money came in, landed here

 Kumar Vishwas: Who are our three companions
 ham khaat par baithne se pehle date of berth puch rahe the
 There is a slight difference between the poet and the artist
 main kavita likhakar desh ke iaiti or im tak pahunchaa
 He was the country's most expensive poet
 magar jab andolan hue tab bhi saamne aayaa
 i did not write for Padma Shri and Sahitya Academy
 kahin gaya, to saamne jo netaa baitha he, uskaa kabhi apmaan nahin kiya
 But now i am political
 jo galat he, uskaa virodh kar rahaa hum
 Question (from Kumar Vishwas): Congress is making posters

 Children are fast
 log ab lambey bhaashan nahin sunanaa chaahate, jo dil main he vahi bolie
 Those who are standing, sit down
 jo baithe hai, let jaaen
 Amma-aunt are like all
 hamaare kanpur main kai mohallon main gaya
 In the slum
 unke yahaan neeche kaa khand he
 Friend relatives put the cots on the road
 tabhi khatiya jameen se upar uth gai
 The earthquake did not occur
 jhankkar dekha to kanpur kii do suariya apni peeth khuja rahi thim
 Drains keep buzzing
 bahut suar hai
 They do not know how many children
 koun doodh pi gaya
 Whose number did not come
 bijli kii itani samasya he
 We are in love
 aaj na jaae
 As soon as he came and pressed the button
 aauun kii aawaaj kar chali gai
 Speaking forcefully is a matter of home
 aaj hi gai he
 Never goes
 14 saal baad gai he
 The fan shakes from the top and tells it is a lie
 pankhaa kahata he, main to hawa baad main duungaa
 Open the window, let the wind blow
 to main manoranjan ke saath vahaan ke logon kii samasyaon ko uthaane kaa kaam kar rahaa hum
 i am not the son of a movie star or leader
 mumbai gaya, to auto bhi chalaaya
 i don't want any sympathy
 log kehete hai ki ye na bataao wo na bataao
 Then, while driving the auto, Shisha spoke upright
 bhaiya dur-dur baitho
 We are also human
 
 
 sawaal (manoj tiwari se): kalakaar ke taur par jo pahchaan hoti he
 But what do you have to do in your style to win the candidate? Manoj: i listen to the heart
 pichhali baar sapa se chunaav lard chukaa hum
 Socialism tempts me
 lohia ji kii nitiyaan acchhee lagati hai
 But when you go somewhere and do not see, then you have to take the path of return
 modi ji ke liye mere dil kii pukaar he
 i am still crazy dibet jarur dekhtaa hum
 Whether to return from the shoot at 3:30 pm
 congress ko 65 saal die
 Modi ji should give 5 years
 raily main bheed aati he
 So for that i have composed a song
 
 
 bharat mata he pidaa main or ye bheed peeda kii murat he
 The whole country is calling, now Modi is needed
 peeda ke liye kuch alag se nahin karnaa hota
 Dil said, if Manoj Tiwari stands with Modi, he will get banned in many places
 kai sarkari kaaryakramon main nahin bulaayaa jaataa
 Question: It used to happen in the Emergency
 ab kahaan hota he?manoj:upi main ab nahin bulaayaa jaataa
 Raju: No, you have programmed a lot
 isliye nahin bula rahekumar vishwaas:hamen bula lo raju
 Raju: Hey, you are from UP

 Today i have a good life magar jahaan jivan guzaara, unhen kaise bhul jaaen
 So it was seen that a man has passed the exam in 12 years
 sapa se tikat par ladane ke sawaal par, main anaadi faisle main chalaa gaya
 Was under the influence of Amar Singh
 unhone amitabh bachchan se milwaaya
 Asked him in front of them to contest the election
 main manaa nahin kar paaya
 But learned that if you now contest elections, you will have to stand like a hero even after five years
 govinda kii tarah nahin
 Question (from Kumar Vishwas): What he himself says, he is writing
 aap yahaan se amethi chale gaye
 It is not just the name symbol
 rahul gandhi kaa pratik he, kya goonjata he aapke dil main, jab aap amethi pahunchate hai?kumaar vishwaas:main kisi prabhamandal kii vajah se raajnneeti main nahin aayaa
 i am a laser paid man by them
 pehali kavita 100 rupee main padhi
 Walked in a roadway bus without glass
 phir desh kaa sabase mahangaa kavi bana
 i went to Amethi 6-7 months ago
 raibareli main jahaan maia ji jitati hai or amethi jahaan bhaiya ji jitate hai
 The road between these two is the road between the pits
 is par 6 maheene main 12 garbhvatee mahilaon kii maut hui
 The bail of the MP of such area should be confiscated
 mujhe aisa laga
 That is why i am calling people from all over the country
 aao sawaal pucho
 Back in MNREGA
 sakshartaa main peeche
 Further into malnutrition
 sab aapke haath main tha
 If you want cylinders from 9 to 12 in three days
 thodaa vahaan ke liye bhi kar dete, jinhone is laayak banaaya
 i am writing the history of Amethi
 i am writing a history of Amethi
 Amaswal (from Nagma): You are knowledgeable in 9 languages
 or congress to 9 pradeshon main bhi nahin he
 Nagma: i thank God that i got success in 9 languages
 filmein amuman sachai kaa aaina hoti hai
 Many artists also have patriotism
 abhi kumaar vishwaas ji ne kaha, maine kabhi paise nahin liye
 i can also proudly say that i never took a penny for any political work
 na hi main aage luungi
 Whenever worked in languages
 hindi main kaam kar koi duusari bhashaa main jaataa nahin
 In Hindi i worked in Sub a Plus grade
 kuch din pehle suna tha bhojpuri main badi actress ke bare main sochate nahin
 We do not always work for money
 bhojpuri main kaam karne se vahaan kii samskruti pataa chalati he
 The work that i have done together with Manoj ji and Ravi Kishan ji, films also enhances the respect of language and culture
 jahaan tak vichaardhaara kii baat he
 Secular Ideology
 mere idial nehru ji rahe hai
 Many young people of the country are inspired by him
 unhone hameshaa uniwarsity or diaversity kii baat kii
 Now again and again there is talk on tea chaupal
 koun he jise chaay yaa chaoupal par charchaa pasand nahin
 But does every tea person have respect
 har chote se chote aadmi kii izzat honi chahie
 But why did America not give visa to this tea-seller
 kyon ye aadmi sahanubhuti lenaa chahta he
 Indira ji made a name in the world, not in the country
 sonia ji india shining ke khilaaf akeli mahila thim, jo ladi thim
 He has achieved his status by fighting
 10 saal se party adhyaksh hai
 Manoj Tiwari: i am happy with Nagma ji
 boleen ki bahut dinon tak vija nahin mila
 Yes, right, Confuse happened, but now gone
 kumaar vishwaas:nagma ji kii baat se sahamat hum
 They speak 9 languages
 congress sabhi bhashaaon main ek jaisaa soch rahi he
 You do not have democracy
 industry main bade star kaa betaa aa saktaa he
 But it does not necessarily go away
 main to apane bacchon se kahata hum ki priyanka gandhi ke bacchon ke haath jodo, pataa nahin 30 saal baad piem ban jaaen
 Question (from Kumar Vishwas): You are talking here and there, but the kayak seems to be sinking in Delhi
 kumaar vishwaas: mujhe khushi he ki lagaataar barason se raashtra nirmaan kar rahi vipakshi partiyaan arvind kejariwal kaa virodh kar rahi hai ki isane chaar hafton main kharaab kar diya desh
 Question (from Raju): Among the corrupt leaders Arvind Kejriwal referred to, your opponent is minister Sriprakash Jaiswal
 kya kahenge aap ke candidet se?raju:dekhie jhaadoo kii samasya he ki ye kuch hi maheenon main bikhar jaati he
 Nagma: i agree with Raju
 manoj:mujhe us din bahut aashcharya hua ki aam aadmi party ne bhi congress se samjhauta kar liya
 Today the condition is that let anyone vote, the government is made by the Congress
 kumaar vishwaas:aapaki raajnneetik samajhadaari par mujhe shaq he
 Pandit ties thread in Indore
 to dakait se bhi bolta he, yen baddho bali raja
 That means your business should grow
 to main kavi ke rup main kahin gaya, to atithiyon ke liye acchhee baaten kahin
 Today we are making laws for the corrupt, so the Congress is at stake
 ham raajnneeti karne nahin badalane aae hai
 Manoj Tiwari: We are artists, against whom we will be against, it will also hurt to speak from the front
 magar congress or aam aadmi party par meraa kanfusion barkaraar he
 Question: Robert Vadra was also mentioned
 
 
 raju:land scam main fanse hai vah, aisa pataa chalaa
 Land takes constipation
 pichley hafte galati se unhone apni jameen par kabja kar liya
 It happened that there was a lot of fog that day
 raat bhar kabja karte rahe
 In the morning, the laborers said that it is yours
 sawaal (manoj tiwari se): ek aisa shaks jisaki aap prashansa kar rahe hai, usne 2007 main gujarat wibrant shuru kiya tha
 Since then, we have discovered a lot of visuals to see if there is a cup of tea
 nahin dikhi
 Is now visible kya ye nai cheez nahin he, jiskaa zikr kumaar kar rahe hai ki siyasat sadak se hi chalegi?manoj:modi ji ne ek chelange ko sweekaar kiya
 Someone said that they have the means to sell tea
 takalif vaala statement tha
 But he said, we will walk on the road
 phir se chaay bechenge
 i am supporting the BJP which has people like Shivraj Chauhan, Raman Singh, Narendra Modi and Manohar Parrikar
 un par meraa bhi ek sapana he
 Dreams only
 public main niraashaa he
 We are also seeing the same way
 agar laga ki paanch saal main nahin de paae to kya jaruri he ki tarif karun
 It seems that the test that took place in Gujarat in 12 years
 vah sahi sabit hoga
 Nagma: Not evil to dream
 chote se chote insaan ko sammaan milanaa chahie
 But one should also see one's thoughts and thoughts
 jab patang udati he, to hindu-muslim sampradaay kii baat aati he
 The dog puppies are talked about after the riots
 artist ho yaa netaa, use bahut samvedansheel hona chahie
 i have objection if Modi-like person becomes PM
 sawaal: netaa kalakaar ho gaya he or kalakaar nai bhoomika main aa gaya he
 Raju: In the rally, Modi said that 56 inches of chest should be made to make Gujarat
 to maine insaanon main dekha nahin he
 Yes it happens in demons and demons
 is tarah kii tulana nahin honi chahie
 Even though i am from the Samajwadi Party
 magar bura laga ki kisi chaay vaale kaa apmaan nahin hona chahie
 It is not that the tea-seller has been respected
 kaise bolte rahe hai
 Tea has come, part bay, now the respect of the tea people has increased
 rahi saifai kii baat, to vahaan hameshaa naach gaanaa nahin ho rahaa tha
 Folk dances took place
 painting hui
 This is necessary
 ham kalakaaron ko rojgaar miltaa he
 Farmers have been sons, teachers, leaders
 sawaal (raju se): kalakaar ke taur par aap kya kehete hai, karte hai, raajnneeti main aane par kya use yaad rakhaa jaae yaa bhula diya jaae?raju:us vakt jo kaha gaya, bas hansaane ke liye kaha gaya, use is tarah se liya janaa chahie
 Nagma: i do not agree, i am not in a position to humiliate anyone
 raju:hasya kalakaaron ko samaaj kii taraf se thodi si chhot milani chahie
 Nagma: But those people who are interested in politics want to improve the country
 ve padhein aaj bhi vahi kavitaayen
 Today we are talking about pits
 kumaar vishwaas:maine aaj tak kisi ke khilaaf yun kavita nahin likhi
 You bring main amethi chhod duungaa
 Find a line that is against any religion, caste or gender or society
 to main saarvajanik jivan chhod duungaa
 Nagma: Mallika Sarabhai of your party also said that you never respect women
 raju:nahin ye auraton kii kabhi-kabhi izzat karata he
 Kumar Vishwas: i am not like Madrena and Romesh Sharma
 raju:maine ek joke kiya
 Asaram's people got angry
 phone par dhamkiyaan dene lage
 You remember, Saddam Hussein was caught
 to bunker main mili the
 Long long beard
 ye news aa rahi thi
 Seeing a straightforward woman, she said, a brother, he grabbed Asaram Bapu
 ye main to nahin bol rahaa
 The character of the woman is saying
 ab phone aane lage
 Your comedy will penetrate
 are ye line kaat dena
 It is a big problem
 hansaaen kaise hansaaen
 Kumar Vishwas: You hurt feelings for my 2003 video now
 raju:are kahin meri na nikaalani shuru kar den
 Kumar: Right now all the neighborhoods of the country will complain against Manoj Tiwari
 bagal vaali jaan mareli
 Raju: One day i was copying Atal ji
 adwani ji ke ghar main
 They were rubbing hands, i understood that to stop
 chunaav gaye bhaad main
 Do what is happening in the heart
 jisamen janata khush ho rahi
 Do not do this dry dry party
 janata ke sawalmodi ke masale par hamen yues kaa stamp kyon chahie? yues sirf buli karnaa jaanata he
 Nagma - My objection is to the chaupal of tea and the common man
 ye niyat par nahin kaha gaya tha
 That the US did not give them a visa
 to iskaa ek kaaran tha
 The issue is not about tea
 inaki dangon par jo tippaniyan thim
 a 56-inch chest comment, which makes no sense to politics
 main is baat par tiki hum
 Question (from Kumar Vishwas): With which mouth will you ask women to vote? Kumar: Artists often disappear after winning elections
 maine amethi main ghar le liya he
 But till date Rahul Gandhi is running from Munshiganj guest house
 unhen shaayad mitti se badboo aati hogi vahaan
 Raju Srivastava: Amma lives in Kanpur
 ghar he
 i live in Mumbai for a profession
 agar aadmi thaan le, to donon cheez ho sakati hai
 People lie that they do not want money
 jhooth bolte hai ki seva veva
 We should sit in the train
 sab peeche pad jate hai ki gajodhar joke sunaao
 Therefore, they sit on the flight
 kumaar vishwaas:pichley 40 saal se mere varisht surendra sharma apni bivi par joke suna rahe hai
 But he is a friend of Rajiv Gandhi
 isliye koi kuch nahin kahata
 i tell jokes hajaar baar sunaata hum
 Nagma: Just saying, now his greatness has come to the fore
 kumaar vishwaas:sahab 67 saal main jo kuch acha hua
 He brought you bas aapse itnaa kahana he ki
 
 
 Nothing was seen in the darkness, how the light came that the eye was gone Manoj Tiwari: You are right, but Sidhu is fighting for the same thing that he should be fought from Amritsar itself
 meraa to abhi test hona he
 It will be an effort to remain as a hero even after five years
 nagma:akasar artiston ko political dal ghasitkar laate hai
 They are famous
 kai log jeet bhi jate hai
 But see you in South, Mgr
 jayalalita, antiaar, bahut saare artist rahe, siem bhi bane, prabhavi bhi rahe
 Shatru ji, Jaya ji are still active
 ye angana kisi kaa nahin he
 One who wants to work with passion
 uske liye hairaaju:main nagma kii baat se sahamat hum
 Good for those who want to struggle
 ham bhi 50-50 rupee main kaarykram karte the
 Now it seems that the society should be returned
 hamen ye bhi sochna chahie ki desh ke liye kya kiya
 Can not build bridges, cannot bring electricity
 pados kaa kachra to saaf kar sakate hai
 Railway crossing in Kanpur is closed
 peeche se laal batti vaali gaadi sabko paar kar bilkul phatak ke paas ad jaaegi
 Now ask them, where will the traffic in front come from
 kai baaten mere man main hai
 i also told the leader
 ye pasand nahin ki cabinet mantri yaa siem hamaare shahar hi aate hai to saare adhikari apana vibhaag chhodkar helliped par aise khadey rahete hai
 Everyone should continue in their work
 or meeting main jo ghanton mote mote haar pahanaae jate hai
 Five and six people drag
 phir kai mundi aati he
 So this necklace should end the culture of flowers and attendance
 panchayat aaj tak kii puri kawarej ke liye clic karen Looking at the condition of Rahul Gandhi today, i remember a saying
 choube gaye the chhabbe banane, dube banakar laut aae
 Now the fear is that Dubey has come back, not Shubey anymore
 nahin-nahin shube koi shabd nahin hota
 Dubey was linked with two
 to maine do hataakar shunya jod diya
 However, why do you have to give Rahul something like this in politics, do some secret work on this
 mayawati, sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi, manmohan singh or idhar kuch vakt se narendra modi bhi
 These people have been avoiding interviewing
 mayawati ne pichley dinon lakhanu raily main khud is baat kii tasadeeq kii
 He also clarified that there are still Manuwadi people in the media
 kaho kuch, chhapate kuch hai, phir dete raho safai, magar public tak baat nahin pahunchati
 So this is the reason for BSP supremo
 na to vah intervyuu detii hai
 Neither takes questions in the press conference
 itnaa hi nahin, raily or pisi main bhaashan bhi likhaa hua padhati hai
 Mayawati has no problem
 unka kader bandhaa hua he or us tak sandesh pahunch jaataa he
 But can Rahul Gandhi also say the same thing for himself
 kya congress kaa koi kader bachaa hua he
 But it is better to start from the beginning
 manmohan singh jab piem nahin the, tab unke intervyuu main mukhyadhara kii ruchi nahin thi
 When he became the Prime Minister, he kept on thinking that his unethical CEO image should not be discounted
 kyonki sawaal to siyaasi hi puche jaaenge
 But then Manmohan gave an interview
 ye vakt tha indo-yues newclear deal kaa
 UPA-1 was running with the support of the Left and Karat Babu was adamant on opposing the US
 tab manmohan ne bhi mulaayam ke bharose sakht hone kaa man banaaya
 One day i told a senior journalist of an English newspaper, Manini Chatterjee, that i had a long time to do a book
 aaie chaay par batiyaayein
 And then the things that she talked about appeared, then the direct heat reached the comrades sitting in Lalgufa in Kolkata
 manmohan kaa hit sadh gaya
 He still spoke after this, but in Parliament or other government forums
 press conference ke naam par is saal kii shuruyaat main najar aae
 Smiled at the question of silence and said, i speak on the Congress platform and even if excited, just on Modi
 thik bhi he, ab desh unhen kitna sunanaa chahta he, sab jaanate hai
 But Gandhi family, he claims that he has heard the voice of the country
 uski phikr kii he
 In Rahul Gandhi's own words, this voice is 3 thousand years old
 ashok or akbar kii he ye aawaaj
 Then why did Sonia Gandhi never come before the country
 kah sakate hai ki 2004 tak reliyon ke jariye samvaad karti raheen or uske baad bhi vah kisi sarkari pad par nahin thim
 So the accountability was not straightforward
 magar ab ye daanv kitne chal paa rahe hai
 Public wants straightforward talk
 jo raisina hill par kabiz hai, unase jawaab chaahati he
 Let's get one more argument right
 sonia ji kii sehat ab thik nahin rahati
 Then the needle rests on Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhi, jinhone jab shuruyaat main ye kaha tha ki haa, ye sach he ki main gandhi parivaar ke chalate yahaan tak aasaani se aa gaya, magar ab main is system ko badalanaa chahta hum
 It was thought that Congress might change now
 yahaan old guard kaa varchasv toote
 But now after so many years just remember the same song
 kasame vaade pyaar vafa sab, baaten hai baton kaa kya
 But before 2014, Rahul realized that an interview was necessary
 ki sirf press club kii press conference main adhyadesh faadane se yaa phir reliyon main kurte kii baanh chadha bhaashan dene se yaa satta jehar he aisa roti hui maa ne bolaa, jaise jumale oochhaalane bhar se kaam nahin chalegaa
 Then the process of interview started
 pehle intervyuu ke liye chunaa gaya hindi akhbaar dainik bhaskar ko
 Which has wide reach in all Hindi speaking states except Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra
 magar is intervyuu kaa labboluab kya niklaa
 That the party will give responsibility (read pm's), then i am ready
 yahaan asahaj karne vaale bahut zyada sawaal nahin the or jo the bhi, unke jawaab batch nikalne vaale the
 Yet the agenda was set somewhat
 agle din chahu ore is intervyuu kii charchaa rahi
 Then came the second interview
 is baar chunaa gaya aise group ko, jiskaa angreji akhbaar cirkulation ke lihaaj se desh main awwal he
 Whose English news channel claims to have set the agenda for prime time
 or is intervyuu ke dauraan kya hua
 The answers were asked to all the basic questions that this Kunwar of Congress will have to deal with
 magar hasil kya rahaa
 One does not have to be a scholar to understand this
 bas ek najar intervyuu ke baad twitor par chale jokes yaa forward hokar whatsap par aae esemes padhane se lag jaataa he
 How many times has the word system been spoken
 is par khub chatkhaare lekar charchaa hui
 In response to every question, the RTI, Woman's Empowerment, six bills pending in Lok Sabha were discussed
 hua or bhi bahut kuch
 For example, in the face of the issue of riots, Rahul himself was surrounded by Modi himself
 modi kii media scrootni to 12 barason se jari he
 And yesterday the leader of the UPA partner NCP said, now also leave
 court ne bari kar diya or aap vahi raag alaap rahe hai
 But even before 2002 there were riots in the country
 1984 main
 When Rahul's father Rajiv was the PM
 rahul ne kaha, us vakt state ne ection liya
 The BJP, while flouting facts, alleged that the government was sluggish
 rahi-sahi kasar rahul ke intervyuu ke us bol vachan ne puri kar di, jisamen unhone kathith safagoi dikhaate hue kaha tha ki haa, mujhe lagata he ki kuch congressi dangon main shaamil the
 Now Sikhs are on the streets
 chikhakar kah rahe hai ki rahul or sonia gandhi sibiai yaa court ke saamne jaaen or bataaen ki ve koun se congressi hai, jo dangon main shaamil the
 Cleanliness was overshadowed
 to kul jamaa nateeja ye niklaa ki diya tha intervyuu ki chamkegi image
 But here in the reed, fuel only blew and got only smoke
 ab alam ye he ki public discus kar rahi he ki rahul kaise 'narbhasa' rahe the, jabaki party chaah rahi thi ki janata rahul kii is bahaduree par lattu ho jaae
 Picture still left
 kyonki congress mukt karne bharat banane kaa sapana dekh rahe narendra modi kaa bhi pichley kuch dinon se ek video phir se share ho rahaa he
 This video is of an interview given to a TV channel, which Modi left behind
 vajah, 2002 ke dangon par sawaal
 So why does Modi not give interviews? press conference kyon nahin karte
 These questions are also asked by the opponents and their fans also want them
 aakhir kyon na modi ek baar khulkar baat kar hi len
 Do not resort to blogs or tweets
 reliyon main sanket na karen
 In the interview or in the press conference, openly tell us what they think about the riots, clean chit, politics and Muslims
 desh par daawa thonkane waalon ko ye samajhnaa hoga ki ye intervyuu ek aag kaa dariyaa he or duben na duben jump to lagaana hi he
 Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has once again targeted the Modi government
 unhone kaha ki 'mek in india' jaisi niti or nafrat ek saath nahin chal sakate kyonki sattadhari party ke netaaon kii taraf se alpsankhyakon ke liye ja rahe nafrat bhare bayanon se desh kii vinamr chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchataa he
 At the Harvard Business School Auditorium full of students, Tharoor said, "it is not good that people in the ruling party make provocative statements against minorities
" ye thik nahin he kyonki ye bharat kii vinamr chhavi ko khokhla kar rahe hai
 'first settled domestic issues,' he said, adding that there is a need to maintain the pluralistic image of the country in order to attract foreign investment which is very essential for the development and progress of the country
 tharur ne kaha ki bharat ko duniya ke saamne apni vinamr chhavi kii madad se aage badhane se pehle desh ke andar kii samasyaon ko hal karnaa hoga
 Addressing the Enuel Indian Convention 2016 of Vikasharvard University not reaching everyone, Tharoor said, 'we have to solve our domestic problems first to become credible as a nation
 ye sach he ki hamen apane logon ko swasthya, sukhi or surakshit banaae rakhane ke liye bahut kaam karnaa hoga
 Apart from just protecting them from terrorism, they also have to protect them in many other things
 vikaas ho rahaa he lekin itnaa nahin ho rahaa ki har kisi tak pahunche
 Referring to the major schemes launched by the Congress leader Narendra Modi Sarkar, he said, "if we are talking about Make in India, Start Up India and Digital India on one side and want to woo foreign investors, then hatred in India on the other side We cannot do this by spreading
 'congress kaa bachaavek sawaal ke jawaab main tharur ne kaha ki congress party main hunar bharaa hua he
 He said, 'political parties remain with electoral success
 pichley do saalon main hamane kaaphi maat khai he
 Luck in politics always changes
 congress party aisi nahin he, jaisaa ki ise bharat kii sabase bhrasht party ke taur par pesh kiya gaya he
 'tharoor said that during the time when the Congress was in power, many scams arose
 unhone kaha, 'us vakt jo bhi satta main hota, uski chhavi bhi usee tarah bigadati, jis tarah hamaari bigadi thi

 aaj minaa kumari urf mahjabeen bano kaa janmdin he
 Meena Kumari has not been able to fill that place because of her inconsistent characters
 minaa kumari kaa janm mumbai(tab bombai) main saal 1932 main hua tha
 Meena Kumari is known for her inconsiderate characters and personal life and hence she came to be known as 'tragedy Queen'
 minaa kii shuruaati jindagi kaaphi sangharsh se bhari hui thi
 His father Ali Bakhsh was an outstanding artist of the Parsi theater
 minaaki maa prabhavati devi, jinhen baad main ikbaal bano naam se janaa gaya wo bhi ek acchhee kalakaar thim
 The mere benefit of being an artist to parents was a great benefit
 mahaj 6 saal kii umr main unhone pehali baar kisi film ke liye kaam kiya tha, lekin mahjabeen ko asli pahchaan mili saal 1952 main ai film 'baiju baavaraa' se
 The director of this film, Vijay Bhatt, gave a new name to Mahzabeen Bano and since then she came to be known as Meena Kumari
 'baiju baavaraa' ke baadmeena kumari ne saal 1953 tak teen hit filmein dijismen dayera, do bigha jameen or parinita shaamil thi
 Meena Kumari's work in Parineeta was highly appreciated and her role has greatly influenced Indian women
 mana jaataa he ki isi film ke baad unki chhavi 'trgidi queen' kii ho gai
 Personal life was also 'tragedy' Meena Kumari, who was uninspired on the screen, was also full of sorrow
 minaa kumari ne us vakt ke mashhoor film nirmaataa kamaal amrohi ke saath shaadi kii thi
 Kamal was 15 years older than him
 shaadi ke baad hi kamaal amrohi kii film 'pakija' relies hui
 Meena Kumari's performance in 'pakija' can never be forgotten
 lekin aaazaad khayalon kii minaa kaa ye rishta zyada dinon tak nahi chal paaya or saal 1964 main wo kamaal amrohi se alag ho gayi
 The rupture of this relationship had a profound effect on Kamin
 bataaya jaataa he ki minaa is gam ko bhuulaane ke liye sharaab ke nashe main dubi rahane lageen
 She succumbed to liver cirrhosis due to excessive alcohol consumption and died at the age of 39 on 31 March 1972, just weeks after the release of the film 'pakija'
 behtareen shaayar bhi thim minaa kumaribahut kam hi log jaanate honge ki minaa kumari ek behtareen abhinetri hone ke saath hi saath ek acchhee shaayar bhi thim
 After the relationship ended with Kamal, he started venting his heartache on the paper pages
 minaa kii likhi kuch shaayari- talaak de rahe ho najar-e-kahar ke saath, javaani bhi meri lautaa do meher ke saath
 - When found a companion like heart, restlessness also brought him along
 - tum kya karoge sunakar mujh se meri kahani, be-lutf jindagi ke kisse hai fike-fike

 In a dramatic change in Egypt, the country's Islamic President Mohammed Mursi on Sunday repealed the controversial order granting him broad powers but rejected the opposition's demand that a referendum on the new constitution be deferred
 mursi ne samjhaute kaa ek bada sanket dete hue unako vyapak shaktiyaan dene vaale vivaadaaspad aadesh ko nirast kar diya lekin nirnay kiya ki nae samvidhan ke masaude ko lekar janamat sangrah nirdhaarit 15 disambar ko hi hoga
 President Mursi took this dramatic step after a 'national dialogue' with leaders of political parties
 yah vaarta madhya raatri ke baad tak chali
 Mohammad Salim Al Awa, an Islamic leader and advisor to Mursi, said the referendum on the constitution would be held on December 15, and the constitutional order of November 22 on behalf of President Mursi has been largely repealed
 nayi sanvaidhanik ghoshnaa haalanki kisi nyaayik apil se mukt hogi
 According to the new declaration, if the majority of Egyptians vote against the draft of the constitution, the new Constituent Assembly will be elected within three months and will have six months to draft a new constitution
 aadesh radd hone ke baavjood mursi kaa nirnay pichhali taarikh se nahin lagu hoga jiskaa matlab he ki ghoshnaa ke baad se ab tak kiye gayi nirnay barkaraar rahenge or mursi ke nirnay nyaayik samiksha se upar honge
 The decision comes after a week-long protest against the referendum and constitutional declaration
 in pradarshnon main mursi ke samarthakon or unke virodhiyon ke bich hinsak sangharsh hua
 The clash killed at least seven people and injured 700 others
 awa ne kaha ki nayi ghoshnaa mursi ke nirnyon ko nyaayik samiksha se pare rakhane ko samaapt nahin karegi lekin raashtrapati kii abhi bhi yah jimmedaari he ki vah kranti or uske uddeshyon kii raksha karen

 Katju tweeted about the work of Modi government, 'now the only thing left is that the government give India the status of a holy country
 katju ne iske liye vajahen bhi ginai or suzav bhi die
 Why should India be made a Holy Country? - Here the holy rivers like Ganga Narmada flow
 -veda puraana, ramayana mahabharat, jaisi pavitra kitaaben likhi gayi
 - Cow is a sacred animal, in the name of protecting, the paralyzed baboons cheat the public
 -ram, krishna, mahavir yaheen paidaa hue or buddha ko gyaan yaheen mila
 Kumbh, the world's largest fair, is also held in this holy country
 -ayodhya, mathura, kaashi, kanchi puri, haridwar, madurai jaise pavitra shahar yaheen hai
 Now even Amritsar and Anandpur can get the status of holy cities
 katju ne die ye suzav-raghupati raghav rajramko raashtragan ghoshit kiya jaae
 - India Gate should be erected and statue of Lord Ram 100 feet high should be made
 -har shahar ke mukhya chowk par gomata kii pratimaa ho jisaki dekharekh gaurakshak karen
 They should be able to do anything in the name of cow protection

 bharat duniya kaa doosraa sabase bada mobile bazaar he, isi vajah se yahaan aap dheron smartfones or smartphone companiyon ko dekh sakate hai
 However, the country's own telecom company Reliance Jio targeted the feature phone market in India differently through jiophone and jiophone 2
 jeeyo kii pehle hi feechar phone main bazaar main hissedari kaaphi zyada he or ek nai report is ore ishaara kar rahi he ki company ek nayaa smartphone launch kar sakati he
 This smartphone can be launched during the AGM in July
 beetelbite news website se baat karte hue ek jeeyo ke adhikari ne bataaya ki company is saal july main AGM ke dauraan android besd smartphone launch kar sakati he
 It has also been reported in this report that this smartphone will have a 5-inch touchscreen display and it will run on Android Oreo (go Edition)
 saath hi ye smartphone jiophone 2 se bhi mahangaa hoga or isaki keemat $63 (lagbhag 4,500 rupee) ke aasapaas hogi
 If this news comes true, then it will be a big step from the company after jiophone and jiophone 2
 kyonki ab tak company ne keval alphanumeric or QWERTY keyboard vaale feechar phones ko hi utaara he or ek bhi smartphone bazaar main nahin pesh kiya he
 Both the feature phones of the company are also quite popular and the new smartphone can also get good success in the market
 aise main bajet segment main philhal maujuud Xiaomi jaisi companiyon ko kadi pratispardhaa kaa saamana karnaa hoga

 This time the Congress is preparing to come up with a new strategy to surround the BJP in Gujarat
 lagaataar 2003, 2008 or 2013 main modi mukhyamantri ke taur par congress ko patkhni de chuke hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when Modi became the prime ministerial candidate, Gujarat put 26 of 26 seats in the bjp's seat
 ab congress ko lagata he ki patel samaaj kii naaraazgi, bijepi sarkaar ke kareeb 18 saalon kii satta virdohi lahar ke saath ho modi kaa mukhyamantri nahin hona uske haq main ja saktaa he
 However, there is a fear that is haunting the Congress
 wo he, sampradayik dhruvikaran kaa
 In fact, the Congress believes that whether the Gujarat Assembly elections were held or the 2014 Lok Sabha elections or the recent UP Assembly elections, the major reason for bjp's success in all this was the sharing of hindu-muslim votes
 congress ab bihar vidhansabha chunaav se sikh lekargujrat vidhansabha chunaavamein utarane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The Congress has prepared a special plan for Gujarat so that elections do not get polarized
 plan ko itnaa sikret rakhaa gaya he ki khulkar congress ke netaa naa hi is par baat kar rahe hai or naa hi is plan main unki koi khuli bhoomika hogi
 Congress strategists will execute this strategy from behind the scenes
 'shanti plan' taiyarsutron ke mutabik congress gujarat main 'shanti plan' anjaam dene kii koshish kar rahi he
 Congress leaders have prepared a list of well-known people belonging to the minority society, who have penetration in the society of their area
 inke saath hi sanjeeda logon ke chote chote group bana diye gaye hai or unako unka kaam samajha diya gaya he
 These will go silently, without noise, in groupmuslimilacs
 ye logon ko samajhaayenge ki chunaav ke vakt aakraamak naa hon or kisi ke uksaave main naa aaen
 Do not go to vote especially on the polling day
 saamaanya tareeke se chupchaap matdaan karen
 Do not react to any incident that can spread disharmony among hindu-muslims
 kul milakar congress kii koshish he ki jaise bihar main hindu- muslim voton ke bich dhruvikaran roka gaya vaisaa hi gujarat main doharaaya jaae
 According to sources, the Congress also feels that in the last election, in the end, Modi had directly polarized Mian Ahmed Patel
 jabaki wo siem ummidavaar dur dur tak nahin the
 This time too, the Congress is afraid that the way Ahmed Patel won the Rajya Sabha election by penetrating the fortifications of Modi and Amit Shah, after that the BJP can say at the last moment that Congress will make Mian Ahmed Patel the CM of Gujarat from the backdoor Wants to is daanv kii kaat ke liye khud ahamed patel ne tay kiya he ki wo apane har bhaashan or saakshaatkaar main baar baar clear karenge ki wo naa siem candidet the, naa hai or naa honge
 Congress, which has been losing to Modi constantly in Gujarat, is preparing to try this new arrow this time too
 asal main to gujarat kii janata hi bataaegi ki ye tir nishane par lagegaa yaa nahin

 Let me tell you that recently the Jodhpur court sentenced Salman Khan to 5 years in the case of black deer in 1998, while in other cases Saif Ali Khan, Neelam, Tabu and Sonali Bendre were acquitted for lack of evidence
 islam main pramukh rup se do bade tyohaar manaae jate hai
 One eid-ul-fitr and the other eid-ul-azha
 is saal do sitambar ko hindustan main id-ul-ajaha manaai jaaegi
 On the occasion of eid-ul-azha, the Muslim society offers prayers as well as animal sacrifices
 islam ke anusaar qurbaani karnaa hazrat ibrahim alaihissalam kii sunnat he, jise allaah ne musalamaanon par vaazib kar diya he
 Actually, the continuation of Qurbani lasts for three days, including the day of Eid
 muslim samaaj allaah kii raja ke liequrbaani kartaahe
 Sacrifices are considered justified by the money earned in the halal way, not by the proceeds of haram
 qurbaani kaa islamic mahatvamufti ejaj arshad kaasmi ke anusaar islam main qurbaani kaa kaaphi bada mahatv he
 In view of Islam, Allah ordered Hazrat Ibrahim Alaihissalam to sacrifice his dearest thing
 hazrat ibrahim alaihissalam ko 80 saal kii umr main aulad naseeb huri thi
 In such a situation, his son Hazrat Ismail Alaihissalam was most dear to him
 ye ibrahim alaihissalam ke liye ek imtihaan tha, jisamen ek taraf allaah kaa hukum tha to duusari taraf bete kii muhabbat
 In such a situation, he chose the command of Allah and agreed to sacrifice the son for the sake of Allah
 sahibe haisiyat par qurbaani vaazibaise main hazrat ibrahim ko laga ki bete ko qurbaani dete samay unki bhavanaaen kahin aade naa aa jaae
 That is why he tied his blindfold
 ibrahim alaihissalam ne jab bete ismil alaihissalam kii gardan kaatane ke liye churi chalaai to allaah ke hukum se ismil alaihissalam kii jagah ek dumba(ek jaanavar) ko pesh kar diya gaya
 When Ibrahim Alaihissalam removed the blindfold, he found his son standing in front of him
 allaah ko ye adaa itani pasand ai ki har sahibe haisiyat par qurbaani karnaa vaazib kar diya
 Reasonable place is just below duty
 agar sahibe haisiyat hote hue bhi kisi shaks ne qurbaani nahin di to vah gunaahagaar he
 In such a situation it is necessary to sacrifice, it has nothing to do with expensive and cheap animals
 kis par qurbaani vaazibaislam ke mutabik vah shaks sahibe haisiyat he, jis par jakaat ferj he
 The person who has seven and a half tola gold or 52 and a half tola silver or money accordingly
 aaj kii hisaab se agar aapke paas 28 se 30 hajaar rupee hai to aap saadhe 52 tola chaandi ke daayre main hai
 According to this, the person who has close to 30 thousand rupees is worth the sacrifice
 id-ul-ajaha ke maukey par qurbaani dena jaruri ban jaataa he
 Purpose of sacrifice: According to Kasmi, there is a motive behind sacrificing animals in Islam
 allaah dilon ke haal se waakif he
 In such a situation, Allah understands the intentions of every person
 jab banda allaah kaa hukum maanakar mahaj allaah kii raja ke liye qurbaani karata he to use allaah kii raja hasil hoti he
 Despite this, if a person sacrifices as a mere sacrifice, then Allah does not accept his sacrifice
 qurbaani ke teen hissequrbaani ke liye hone vaale jaanwaron par alag alag hisse hai
 Where there are seven parts on large animals, then there is only one part on small animals like Wahembakare
 matlab saaf he ki agar koi shaks bhens yaa oont kii qurbaani karaata he to usamen saat logon ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he to vahiin bakre kii karaata he to wo sirf ek shaks ke naam par hogi
 There is advice in the Shari'a to do three parts of Qurbani's meat
 ek hissaa garibon main takseem kiya jaae, doosraa hissaa apane dost ahabaab ke liye istemaal kiya jaae or teesraa hissaa apane ghar main istemaal kiya jaae
 It is advisable to distribute meat among the poor
 pratibandhit jaanwaron kii qurbaani se bachenmufti arshad kaasmi ke mutabik aise jaanwaron kii hi qurbaani karen jisaki hamen kanoon ijaajat detaa he or aise jaanwaron kii qurbaani katai na karen jin par sarkaar dwaara pratibandh he

 ’ prasad ne kaha, ‘bhartiya cricket to chhodiye vishwa cricket main bhi dhoni ke aasapaas koi wicketiper nahin he
 'prasad's words may shock wicketkeepers like Pant and Sanju Samson who are standing in line after Dhoni
 unhone kaha, ‘sahi kahuun, to ye khilaadi abhi tak us str tak nahin pahunche hai, jisaki unase ummid kii ja rahi thi
 We will still give them a place in the India a tour team and see if they can improve their performance

 is baat kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa bhale hi hona baaki he, lekin bijepi ke centre se lekar bihar tak ke har camp ke netaa is baat ko lekar aashwast hai ki party or unke liye ye sabase behatar vikalp he
 After the announcement of Nitish Kumar's name, there were speculations about who would make the BJP its face, but according to BJP sources, it is believed that in the current political context there can be no better face than Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 
 haalanki, party ke bihar prabharee or kendriya mantri anant kumaar ne jab bihar main narendra modi ke naam par chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa kii to na keval anant kumaar balki bihar bijepi ke varisht netaa or is pad ke sabase prabal daavedaar susheel modi ne saarvajanik rup se iskaa khandan kiya
 But if Ananth Kumar stands by his point, then the reason behind it is being told that party president Amit Shah does not want to announce this
 vah chaahate hai ki party ke sansadeey dal main is mudde par charchaa kii aupchaarikta puri kar lee jaae
 But no one knows when the parliamentary party will discuss this subject
 lekin sawaal he ki party nitish kumaar ke khilaaf kisi ek vyakti khaskar susheel modi ko mukhyamantri kaa umidavaar kyon nahin ghoshit karnaa chaahati? iske peeche yahi tark diya ja rahaa he ki bihar ke modi ke naam kii ghoshnaa hone se party main gutbaji or tej hogi or kai netaa or unki samarthit jatiyaan party ke liye chunaav main utani aakraamak mudra main nahin rahenge jitna wo pradhanmantri modi ke naam par rah sakate hai
 And in the name of Prime Minister Modi, every parliamentarian, minister of Bihar and the leaders who are angry with Sushil Modi will work in the election in mind, even though these leaders also know that Sushil Modi will be the first choice of Prime Minister Modi if majority comes
 iske alaava bihar main bijepi bhale sabase badi party ho, iske sahyogi bhi jaise lok jaanshakti party, rashtriya lok samta party maang kar rahi hai ki bihar bijepi kaa koi cheharaa na hokar pradhanmantri modi ke naam par bihar vidhansabha chunaav main jane par unhen zyada laabh ho saktaa he
 Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha has demanded that if the leader is to be selected, then the BJP should decide the leader in consultation with all its allies
 lekin agar pradhanmantri modi ke naam par chunaav main jane kii ranneeti banati he to usase acha koi vikalp nahin ho saktaa
 The comments darasal bijepi ke sahyogi lalu-nitish-congress ke gathbandhan se khush hai kyonki jab se nitish kumaar ke mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaari par muhar lagi he, achaanak bijepi netritv khaskar rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah unhen ab bhav dene lage hai
 And these allies believe that if there was no lalu-nitish coalition, then perhaps the BJP would have ignored them and they would have been arbitrary even on the coordination of seats, which is now likely to work
 udhar rashtriya janata dal adhyaksh lalu yadav ne bijepi se poocha he ki kya bijepi aisi nirvansh party he jiske paas mukhyamantri pad kaa ek umidavaar nahin
 Janata Dal United leader and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has also quipped that not making a Bihar BJP leader a chief ministerial candidate reflects the party's pessimistic mindset
 nitish kumaar ke naam kii ghoshnaa ke baad is baat ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki bijepi kise apana cheharaa banaaegi, lekin bijepi ke sutron ke mutabik, aisa mana ja rahaa he ki vartmaan rajnatik paripekshya main pradhanmantri narendra modi se behatar koi cheharaa nahin ho saktaa
 However, when the party's Bihar incharge and Union Minister Anant Kumar announced to contest elections in Bihar in the name of Narendra Modi, not only Anant Kumar but senior BJP leader and most powerful contender for the post, Sushil Modi publicly announced it
 Denied
 lekin anant kumaar agar apni baat se mukare to uske peeche kaaran bataaya ja rahaa he ki party adhyaksh amit shah is baat kii ghoshnaa filhal nahin karnaa chaahate
 He wants the formalities to discuss the issue in the party's parliamentary party to be completed
 lekin sansadeey dal is vishay par kab vichaar vimarsh karegaa, yah koi nahin jaanata
 But the question is why the party does not want to declare one person, especially Sushil Modi, as the chief ministerial candidate against Nitish Kumar? The reasoning behind this is that the announcement of Modi's name in Bihar will intensify factionalism in the party and many leaders and their supported castes will not be in as aggressive an election for the party as it is in the name of Prime Minister Modi Can
 or pradhanmantri modi ke naam par bihar ke har sansad, mantri or susheel modi se naaraaz rahane vaale netaa man se chunaav main kaam karenge, bhale in netaaon ko bhi maaloom he ki bahumat aane par pradhanmantri modi kii pehali pasand susheel modi hi honge
 Apart from this, BJP may be the biggest party in Bihar, its allies like Lok Janashakti Party, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party are demanding that they should be more benefited if they go to Bihar Assembly elections in the name of Prime Minister Modi rather than Bihar BJP
 Can
 kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha ne iske liye maang kii he ki agar netaa kaa chayan karnaa ho to bijepi apane sabhi sahyogiyon ke saath vichaar vimarsh kar netaa tay kare
 But if there is a strategy to go to the polls in the name of Prime Minister Modi, then there can be no better option than that
 tippaniyan In fact, bjp's allies are happy with the alliance of lalu-nitish-congress because ever since Nitish Kumar's candidature for the post of Chief Minister has been approved, suddenly the BJP leadership especially national president Amit Shah has started giving him a sense
 or in sahyogi dalon kaa maananaa he ki agar lalu-nitish gathbandhan nahin hota to shaayad bijepi unhen nazarandaaj kar chalati or siton ke talmail par bhi wo manamaani karti jisaki sambhaavna ab kaam ho gayi he
 On the other hand, Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Yadav has asked BJP whether BJP is such a dynasty party which does not have a candidate for the post of Chief Minister
 janata daal united netaa or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bhi chutki lee he ki bihar bijepi ke kisi netaa ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar na bananaa party kii ghor niraashaa kii maansikta darshata he

 com / pzusczrdl1 eches phulka march 2017 main punjab main netaa vipaksh bane the, lekin kuch hi samay baad unhone netaa vipaksh pad se yah kahkar istipha de diya tha ki vah 1984 ke cese par focus karnaa chaahate hai
 Recently, he also resigned from the legislative assembly to protest against the lax attitude of the Punjab government in the case of the absurdity of Guru Granth Sahib
 kaaphi samay se phulka aam aadmi party kii baithkon main nazar nahin aa rahe the
 Not only this, Phoolka had said publicly that i will resign if the Aam Aadmi Party has an alliance with the Congress
 haalanki ab aam aadmi party kaa congress se gathbandhan nahin hone ja rahaa or party ne dilli punjab or haryana kii sabhi loksabhaa siton par chunaav ladane kaa faisla kar liya he
 In such a situation, the question arises that why Phulka has resigned from Aam Aadmi Party? Chances are that when HS Phoolka neither the Leader of Opposition nor the MLA was there and he was not particularly close to the party high command, but his differences with the party were more, then what would he do while in the party? Phoolka's name is known for bringing justice to the 1984 violence victims
 lekin jab wo ek party ke netaa taur par ladaai ladate hai to unki is koshish ko log political nazariye se bhi dekhte hai
 They no longer have the benefit of joining the party
 isse acha party se alag hokar sikh samaaj ke liye ladenge to zyaada saakh banegi
 At this time, the condition of the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab is bad
 party jabardast andruni ladaai se guzar rahi he
 While Phulka's name has become bigger now by getting Congress leader Sajjan Kumar sentenced to life imprisonment in 1984 anti-sikh violence case
 aise main ho saktaa he ki phulka ko ab aam aadmi party brands kii jarurat naa lagati ho yaa jis makasad ke liye vah aam aadmi party main shaamil hue the vah ab bina party ke bhi hasil karne kii sthiti main hon
 HS Phoolka had mentioned several times that Delhi's Arvind Kejriwal government did not work as expected for the 1984 violence victims
 naa peedit pariwaron ko muaavja dilvaaya naa naukari di
 There is a possibility that Phoolka may have this pain in her mind which has now come out
 21 disambar ko dilli vidhansabha main aam aadmi party ne purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi se bharat ratna sammaan waapas liye jane kii maang vaala prastaav paas kar diya tha
 It was argued that Rajiv Gandhi justified the slaughter of Sikhs in 1984, but the Aam Aadmi Party later reversed
 jabaki 31 disambar ko phulka ne rajeev gandhi ke bare main apni raay jaahir kii
 Phoolka had tweeted that, 'rajiv Gandhi gave a clean chit to Sajjan Kumar without any investigation
 7 november 1984 ko vipakshi netaa pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi se mili or 1984 sikh narsanhaar main sajjan kumaar or duusare congressi netaaon ke shaamil hone kii baat kahi
 Congress told media - no Congress leader involved
 koi bhi jaanch nakaaree
 As Congress President, Rahul Gandhi must answer to the nation
 rajeev gandhi ne sajjan kumaar ko kyon bachaaya? sambhaavna he is mudde par phulka ke matbhed hue ho, jiske baad unhone istifa diya ho
 Islamist President Muhammad Morsi, who was ousted from Egypt's power, has been sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of conveying government intelligence to Qatar

 In his formal press conference after the adjournment of the Parliament session indefinitely, Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of adopting a double stance

 He rejected suggestions that the government combined to pass the Lokpal Bill due to lack of majority in the Rajya Sabha and the Trinamool Congress, a key ally of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), against some provisions of the bill

 " unhone kaha ki guuruuvaar madhyaraatri ko rajyasabha kii kaarywahi isliye sthagit kar di gai, kyonki iske baad satr kii avadhi nahin badhaai ja sakati thi
 BJP knew this
 yadi vah lokapal vidheyak ko paarit karwaane ko lekar gambheer thi to use madhya raatri se pehle hi ise paarit karwaane kii koshish kerani chahie thi
 Regarding the Trinamool criticizing the government on the issue, Bansal said, "they are free to express their views
" sarkaar trinmul sahit sabhi dalon se is par aam sahmati banane ke liye baatcheet kar rahi he
 We have to wait for three more months
 " Bansal said that the government was ready to debate the Lokpal on the 28th but the BJP did not agree to it
 baad main itane sanshodhan laa die gaye ki unako dekhe bina kuch karnaa mushkil tha
 Actually, the BJP only wanted the debate to be stretched for so long
