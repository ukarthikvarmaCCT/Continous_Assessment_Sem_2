 japan main narendra modi ke bare main saarvajanik raay se media main ek patali dhara se mahanadi kii tarah pragati ke kai daravaaje khule hai
 Japanese media first met Modi in April 2007
 tab ve gujarat ke kaarobaariyon or rajya ke adhikariyon ke 50 sadasyeey pratinidhimandal ke saath japan aae the
 He appealed for Japanese investment by citing the excellent business environment in his state there
 ve tabhi japani pradhanmantri shinjo abe se bhi pehali baar mili the
 The timing of his appeal was also appropriate
 bhartiya arthvyavastha ke achche din the
 Due to anti-japan protests in China in 2004 and 2005, Japanese companies were looking for new business opportunities to expand their activities
 us samay tak unke nivesh kaa bada thikaana china hua karata tha
 Gujarat was considered a good place in India as the plan for the delhi-mumbai Industrial Corridor passing through Gujarat began to take shape
 2008 main tata motors kii naino factory ke pashchim bengal se gujarat pahunchane se japan main modi ke bare main raay kaaphi sakaraatmak ho gai thi
 Surprisingly, in the opinion of some Japanese, the Chief Minister had set up a Nano factory in just four days
 japan main modi kii chhavi main teji se sudhaar kaa doosraa daur july, 2012 main aayaa
 At that time, Modi arrived in Japan with a second delegation after receiving a formal invitation
 japan sarkaar ne unka aisa swaagat kiya jaise ve pradhanmantri hon
 Modi then met Abe, whose Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was then out of power
 pratinidhimandal ne tokyo or duusare bade shaharon main nivesh seminar kiya jisamen acchhee-khaasi bheed juty kyonki japan main tab tak modi or gujarat ke bare main dilchaspee bad gai thi
 Many Japanese industrialists and government officials attended the Vibrant Gujarat Investment Summit in January 2011
 iske alaava, japan-bharat vyapak aarthik saajhedaari samjhauta bhi agast, 2011 se lagu ho gaya tha
 It was like a free trade agreement
 lihaaja, modi ke liye japan main anukool maahaul banane laga tha or yah ummid bhi paidaa hone lagi thi ki ve ek din bhartiya arthvyavastha ke agua honge
 In October 2011, the CEO of a Japanese Modi-loving Indian investment consulting firm wrote that Gujarat's economic growth was the fastest among Indian states
 sanket diya tha ki modi bharat ke pradhanmantri ban sakate hai
 But even in this second phase of Modi's image expansion, Japanese interest in him was limited to business and government circles only
 modi ke chhavi vistaar kaa teesraa daur sitambar, 2013 main aayaa jab bijepi ne unhen apana pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya
 During this period, ordinary Japanese also became interested in Modi
 japani media main modi kii khabaron kii sankhya dhire-dhire badaae lagi
 Media coverage increased significantly in January 2014 when public opinion polls in India started showing an edge over Modi and bjp's Rahul Gandhi and Congress in the general elections
 media reporton ne saamaanya japaniyon main modi kii chhavi banane main badi bhoomika nibhaai
 How much preference did the Japanese media give to Modi in their reports? The most emphasized aspect is that their economic management is excellent
 unke mukhyamantri kaarykaal main gujarat kii aarthik vruddhi kii dar 10 fisadi rahi jabaki bharat kii aarthik vruddhi dar upie-1 main acchhee shuruyaat ke baad upie-2 main ghatati rahi
 Secondly, Gujarat seems free from corruption and power problems
 vahaan faisle fatafat hote hai, jo duusare rajyon main nahin he
 Some of Modi's slogans were also widely discussed in the Japanese media
 masalan, ‘‘laal feeta nahin, mahaj niveshkon ke liye laal kaaleen’’, ‘‘nunatam sarkaar, adhiktam shashan
 "modi has close ties to Abe
" jab abe kii aldypi ne disambar, 2012 main baari jeet darj kii or ve duusari baar pradhanmantri bane to unhen sabase pehle badhai dene vaale videshi netaaon main modi bhi the
 He was then the Chief Minister, while the head of the congratulators was the head of state
 japani media abe or modi kii nitiyon main samanta bhi bataata rahaa he
 Both are supportive of accelerating the economy and expanding employment opportunities through their respective models, Abenomics and Modinomics
 media ke ek varg main amatrya sen banaam jagadish bhagwati kii bahes par bhi focus kiya
 Sen was said to be in favor of Congress and social welfare while Bhagwati was in favor of BJP and growth
 raksha niti ke maamle main abe kaa jor he ki japan shanti kaa pairokaar he, lekin sainya takat bhi bana rahegaa
 He acknowledged in his speech during the 2013 Hudson Institute of America's Herman Conn Award that he was a right-wing militarist
 modi bhi shreshth bharat kii manyata par jor dete hai
 Perhaps the two Prime Ministers think alike about tackling China aggressively
 haalanki modi apni china niti se paradaa uthaane main saavdhaneepurvak bachate rahe hai, lekin japani media unki dohare arthon vaali tippaniyon par focus karata he
 For example, in his election meeting in Arunachal Pradesh on February 22, 2014, Modi said, "china will have to abandon its vision of expansion
" ’’ phir 6 may, 2014 ko ek akhbaar ko intervyuu main unhone kaha, ‘‘agar bharat or china apane rishton ko sudhaarney or matbhedon ko mitaane kii disha main aage baduya chaahate hai to yah donon deshon ke liye madadgaar hoga
 "but apart from the similarities between the two leaders, there are many important differences that make their point of view
 masalan, abe kaa janm ek ahm rajnatik parivaar main hua jabaki modi apane balboote is mukaam tak pahunche hai
 The Japanese media has praised Modi but has also given his negative side, especially his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots
 kuch akhbaar, channelon main dangon ko narsanhaar bataaya to kuch ne musalamaanon ke khilaaf bijepi or modi ke purvaagrah kaa zikr kiya, yah bhi bataaya gaya ki bijepi ke nae saansadon main koi musalmaan nahin he
 Naturally, there was a mention in the Japanese media of apprehensions of Indian Muslims that Modi might take action against them
 media main bhartiya patrkaar siddharth varadarajan kii ashankaon ko bhi jagah di gai, jinka sawaal he ki ‘‘agar lashkare taiyaba, alqaida yaa koi or pakistan aadhaarit aatanki sanghathan bharat par hamalaa kar detaa he to kya hota he? aise ghatnakram main bharat-pakistan ke rishte kis had tak bigadenge or musalamaanon se kaisaa vyavhaar hoga?’’ zyaadaatar japani log modi sarkaar ke rahete dangon kii baat sunakar hairaan rah jaaenge, haalanki kaiyon kaa maananaa he ki aisa phir nahin hoga
 Modi's predecessor Manmohan Singh did much to strengthen the bilateral relations between Japan and India
 unke media salaahkaar rahe sanjay baru ne 2014 kii apni kitaab da accidental prime ministar main likhaa ki ‘‘abe kii 2012 main satta main vaapasi se agenda jinda ho gaya, japan se aarthik or raksha kshetra main kareebi rishte kaayam karnaa upie-2 kii videsh niti kaa ahm hissaa ban gaya
 "modi is in a good position to carry forward this bilateral relationship
" abe kaa kaarykaal abhi dhai saal tak rahane vaala he
 Therefore, the two Prime Ministers have ample time to strengthen their relationship which will also form the basis of a strong bilateral relationship
 mujhase akasar japani media main yah sawaal poocha jaataa he ki modi or abe kya asia main tanaav paidaa karne vaale china ke khilaaf saajha morcha khol sakate hai
 My answer is that we should not get too excited by the partnership between them thinking that Modi is a right-wing pragmatist like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Abe might not go back to the Yakusukuni memorial of World War One
 hamen unki saajhedaari ko lekar vyarth kii chintaa nahin paalni chahie
 The Japanese media is waiting with bated breath whether Modi's first foreign visit will be to Japan

 koi hadabadi nahin: manjuur ehteshammanjoor ehteshaam kaa upanyaas madrasa yadhyapi kisi bade masale ko apni kissagoi main saamne nahin laata lekin sabir, mariyam, aligarh maamu or bannagi fufu ke alaava jaaydaad mafia gani miyaan or saansad imran alam ke bhinn kirdaaron kii maujuudagi se is samay ke chal-bal ko yahaan kahin adhik safagoi se dekha or mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he
 It is another matter that Manjur Ehtesham's previous novel Basharat Manzil laid the foundation for the kind of anecdote depicting the Gandhian image of patriotic Muslims with some flamboyant idealistic posturing, this anecdote in Madrasa has been somewhat disconcerted
 maddhim gati se upanyaas ko aage badhaate hue manjuur saab kisi hadabadi main nahin dikhte, balki band dimaagon main chal rahi kashmakash ko resha-dar-resha udhedte chalate hai
 The novel, which is woven between Mumbai, Bhopal, Bareilly, Aligarh, and some characters that have been woven through the narrative, are Nanijan, Pardhain and Aamir
 sautelepan kaa dansh vyakti ko kis kadar tanha or yateem bana detaa he, uske maasoom sapanom par vakt ke booton ke nirmam nishaan kis tarah padate hai or kis tarah uskaa ek madrasa banane kaa khwab 
 Landlord
 ja hota he, sabir uskaa nirih paryaay ban gaya he
 After all, one day the secret opens on Sabir that the one he considers his father is his step-father, who has many children from his first wife
 vah jaaydaad main hissaa hasil karne kii muhim par lagata he par kaamyaab nahin hota
 His training also remains incomplete
 vah apni jadon kii talash main bareli, aligarh or bannagi fufu tak pahunchataa he or aligarh maamu se pataa chalata he ki uski maa kaa nikaah unheen kii sahmati se bahut pehle maa kii umr se dyodhi umr ke shaks se hua
 This relationship made him angry that he moved to Pakistan and broke up with Aligarh Mamu
 cricket kaa shk rakhane vaale or baad main rangai-putai ke kaam main sanlagn sabir ke jivan main yon to tamaam ladkiyaan ain, alka bhi jo ek film produsar kii beti thi, par usase baat zyada din bani nahin
 After all, the girl from the affluent Bedi family, whom Pinki fell in love with, made her become Mary and joined her, but this relationship kept her in trouble for a long time
 usase paidaa beti jab tak sayaani or vivaah yogya hui, sabir or mariyam ke bich kaa faasla bad chukaa tha
 So Sabir and Maryam lived the lives of their strangers almost all their lives
 sabir antat madrase kii tamir kaa khwab liye tekri main ek jameen ke tukade kii khatir jis tarah jaddojahad karata rahaa, vah bhi bhoomafiyon ke chalate chakanachur hua
 The fabric of this novel is not very complicated, but its entries sometimes cause boredom
 vrittant main bahaav vaisaa nahin he jaisaa manjuur ke pichley upanyaason sookhaa bargad, daastaan-e-laapata or bashaarat manzil main he
 So sometimes in its prose there is a shadow of a person moving around with laziness
 aligarh maamu shero-shaayari ke shaukeen hai, filmi geeton ke uddhran baat-baat main unki jubaan par hajir rahete hai to mariyam se manmutav hone ke baad sabir gulam ali kii shaayari or madiraa ke pyaale main sharany khojataa dikhataa he
 The dream of the building of the madrasa is a proof of Sabir's bona fides, but there is no identification of such high standards in his own life
 jis damakham kii darkaar sabir se ham karte hai vah usamen na
 Does not know
 kisi mashaal main tabdeel hone kii bajaae vah aadyant uhapoh main padaa rahata he
 If seen in this way, the character of Sabir is very similar to that of the common man whose relationship in the world neither works nor friendship
 jiskaa vishwaas dagamagaaya ho, jisaki buniyaad hi yatimi par tiki ho, jisaki maa ne shuhar ke rahete hue hi ek badi umr ke shaks se ashnai kar rakhi ho jo bhale hi baad main byaah main parinat hui ho, jo apane baap kii parchhaayi se miltaa-julata hua bhi nirih-sa apane liye ek adad 
 Looking for a piece of land and finally returning to 'hareen Ko Harinam', Sabir seems to represent such a tired person
 sawaal uthta he ki manjuur saab is upanyaas ke jariye kya kahana chaahate hai? isaki kaat upanyaas ke blarb main hi haih kisi bhi umdaa rachana ko lekar yah kahana kabhi sambhav nahin hota ki iskaa uddeshy amuk he
 
 
 Rather, it is a picture of our own life woven in bright light, so that we get light from so many directions

 Sabir says in a conversation with Amjad that "my status, come this forty years," in one of the novels stuck in the fixed joulebas without any discussion
 jaad mulk se kam nahin
 Every success, problem, contradiction with which the country is two or four, if there are eyes, then i will see them directly

 My education may not have been done but whatever you have in your life is not less than a madrasa for you
 '' aazaadee kii falshruti ke is roopak main hi is upanyaas kii mahima chhipi he
 In his descriptions, Prithul is very much versed in the novel in terms of relationships, dani talim, tabligi discussions, Devanagari advocacy and madrasa in the form of communal language
 manjuur ne bhale hi isaki kissagoi kii gati ko utana pravaahee na banaaya ho, par desh ke halaat se guzarate aam aadmi or kahin-kahin aam musalmaan ke halaat kaa tadgikaraa yahaan maujuud he
 Tehelka's Managing Editor Shoma Chaudhary also resigned in the case of sexual harassment of a female journalist by Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal
 tahalaka se istife ke baad im-e conference main bhi nahin jaaengi shoma choudhary
 Shoma is accused of saving Tarun Tejpal
 shoma choudhary ne buudhvaar ko patrika ke pradhan sampadak tarun tejpal par yon utpeedan kaa aarope lagane vali mahila sahakarmi ke charitra par laanchhan lagane kii koshish karne ke aarope kaa khandan kiya
 Chaudhary said, 'I refute the reports in the media which said that i have been involved in some way to discredit, intimidate or slam the character of the complainant
 ' choudhary ne aage kaha, 'yah sab durbhaavna kii vajah se kiya ja rahaa he, jiskaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 The Goa Police questioned Shoma for 8 hours continuously for two days in this case
 iske alaava shoma lagaataar is maamle main apane bachaav main safai de rahi thim, lekin un par lagaataar sawaal uth rahe the, jiske baad aakhirkaar unhone apane pad se istipha de diya
 Significantly, Tarun Tejpal has been accused of sexually assaulting a Mumbai-based female journalist twice on November 7 and 8 at a five-star hotel in Goa during her magazine Tehelka's annual Think Fest
 mahila patrkaar ne apni prabandh sampadak shoma choudhary ko offisial mail par shikaayat kii thi
 In response, Tarun accepted the crime of sexual harassment and apologized and left his post for six months
 magar is mail ke saarvajanik hote hi hadakamp much gaya

 dear ol,ye samay tahalaka se jude sabhi saathiyon ke liye bahut mushkil he
 This incident came to my knowledge on November 18 and i immediately took action on receiving the complaint
 maine ek mahila or hamaari sah-kaaryakarta ke rup main hamaari sahyogi ke liye turant karrwai kii
 As soon as the complaint was received, the first step was the Sexual Harassment Committee
 shikaayat par karrwai karne ke liye sirf do hi din the ki usase pehle media par yah khabar aa gai
 After that, this news jumped up with the latest facts in the media
 pichley hafte mujh par puure maamle ko dabaane or nariwadi vichaaron se vichlit hone kaa aarope laga
 i believe that i could have done things differently or in a better way, but i reject all allegations related to pressing the case
 jahaan tak mere nariwadi paksh kii baat he, mujhe lagata he ki maine usee ke mutabik kaam kiya, kyonki maine apni sahakarmi ke paksh ko praathamikta di
 However, despite this, not only people from outside, but also the media have repeatedly raised questions on me and i want to take cognizance of this now
 maine kai saalon se tahalaka ke liye bahut mehnat se kaam kiya, jitna bhi kaam kiya wo mere liye khaas he or main uskaa sammaan karti hum
 i do not want my truth to be questioned, which also tarnishes Tehelka's image
 isliye main tatkaal prabhaav se prabandh sampadak ke pad se istipha detii hum
 i have many readers and colleagues who believe in me in this difficult time, i thank them all
 main is maamle ko band karne or jaruri handover dene offis aauungi
 i cannot tell how painful all this is for me
 main nahin chaahati ki is chunauti ke samay is tarah bich main tahalaka ko chhodkar jaaun, lekin mujhe karnaa pad rahaa he
 i want to be with Tehelka at this time, but do not know whether my stay with Tehelka will help or harm Tehelka
 mujhe afsos he ki mere netritv main mai spashtataa ko nahin banaakar rakh pai
 Shoma loksabhaa chunaav main abhi bhale hi ek saal kaa vakt bachaa ho, lekin dilli ke sabhi saat saansadon ne jansampark abhiyaan shuru kar diya he
 According to Delhi BJP, all the mps will conduct public relations campaign in their respective Lok Sabha constituencies till 7 May

 It is believed that this is the bjp's strategy to reduce the anger arising out of sealing in Delhi by sending mps to their Lok Sabha constituencies to calm the anger of businessmen
 saath hi votaron ke bich jaakar abhi se unke mood ko bhampa ja sake
 About two years ago, a video of a surgical strike by Pakistani army personnel in Pakistan occupied Kashmir has come out
 video main dikhaaya gaya he ki kis tarah javaanon ne bina kisi chook ke saath aatankiyon ke thikaane ko tahas-nahas kar diya tha
 During the surgical strike, the Indian Army attacked with rocket launchers, missiles and small arms
 yah hamalaa bhartiya sena ne jammu-kashmir ke uri sector main bhartiya sena ke camp hue aatanki hamale kii javaabi karrwai ke taur par kiya tha
 Uri was attacked on 18 September 2016 from Pakistan

 Let us tell you that on September 29, 2016, the Indian Army went within three kilometers of pok and carried out this strike

 These launching pads settled in the Pak border were destroyed by the Indian Army in their attack

 The Pakistani army confirmed the death of two of its soldiers in the Indian firing

 Congress had supported, Kejriwal asked for proof! After the surgical strike by the Indian Army, an all-party meeting was called to discuss the situation ahead
 tab congress kii adhyaksh raheen sonia gandhi ne kaha ki congress is maukey par sarkaar ke saath he
 At the same time, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also praised the action of the army, although he also sought evidence of the gestures
 uri main pakistan ne kiya tha waar18-19 sitambar, 2016 ko uri base camp par aatankwaadiyon ne hamalaa kiya tha

 isi ke baad sargical strike ko anjaam dene kii yojana banaai gai thi
 Surgical strike was carried out on the night of 28–29 September 2016, where India had destroyed the terrorists

 Kalashnikov, Tavers, Rocket Propelled Guns, Arms, fast descending from a height of 35,000 feet, everything happened with such a pin drop silence that no one could feel the slightest clutter on the ground
 thik usee vakt jameen par bhartiya sena ke bahadur special forcej ke 7 daste elosi ke paar pakistani bairicads se reng-reng kar aage badhate hue
 a total of 150 personnel were involved in this operation
 ghaatak jabanjon kii ye aathon team bina koi aahat die pioke sthit target thikaanon par pahunch gaye
 Then a sudden explosion, smoke and firing from smoke bombs everywhere carried out the surgical strike
 big bos 11 sijan kii sabase badi hilite shilpa scindia or vikaas gupta kii nok jhonk thi
 From the very beginning in the show, there were fierce debates and fights between Shilpa and Vikas

 Vikas Gupta was the one to file a case against Shilpa Shinde
 media reports ke mutabik vikaas gupta or tivi sho 'bhaabi ji ghar par hai' ke producers nahin chaahate the ki shilpa big bos 11 kaa hissaa bane
 The development of the case, called the mastermind, has a reaction
 unka kahana he ki mujhe maaloom bhi nahin wo big bos main kabhi ane vaali hai
 Before coming to the show, of course, we did not get along with each other
 ab ham achche dost hai

 But development and producers tried to derail

 After the rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Bihar, while the electoral movement is strong, sources are quoting that the election dates may be announced in the first week of September in the state
 jaankaree ke mutabik, bihar main dashahra se pehle or deepawali ke bich kuch charnon main matdaan karwaae jane ke sanket mili hai
 Election Commission prepares to settle the election results till Diwali
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle mukhya chunaav ayukta naseem jaidi ne may maheene main kaha tha kibihar vidhansabha chunaavsitambar-aktubar main honge
 Though Zaidi did not disclose the date of the election, it is understood that the commission is considering ending the voting before the festivals
 jaidi ne may main bataaya tha ki chunaav ayog ne sabhividhansabha kshetronko teen shreniyon main rakhane kaa kaary shuru kiya he
 Where the Election Commission will see the most sensitivity, it plans to deploy the central forces ahead of time
 ayog 243 vidhansabha kshetron main se 36 main voter veryphid paper audit trel (vivipieti) kaa istemaal karegaa
 The number of such assembly segments may also increase

 banaras ke ardli bazaar ke matdaan centre par usha ji se mulaaqaat ho gai
 Voters in hand were wandering to vote for identity cards
 saath main unke pati the jinhone vot daal diya tha
 Usha could not vote because her name was placed in the deleted category in the voter list
 farm 7 ke zariye ghoshnaa kar vot dalwaaya ja saktaa tha, magar unhen wo farm bhi nahin mil sakaa
 Usha is one of the thousands of millions of voters who leave the house to cast their votes in the scorching sun to strengthen democracy
 magar ye kai adchanon ke chalate vot nahin daal pate or idhar-udhar dhakke khate hai
 In Mumbai and Pune, the names of millions of people were missing from the voter list
 chunaav ayog ne iske liye maafi maang kar khud ko zimmedaari se bari kar liya
 There are complaints of huge disturbances at hundreds of booths, but by re-voting in a few booths, the Commission tries to achieve its goal of holding free and fair elections
 darasal, dashakon se chunaav karaate rahane ke baavjood hamaari nirvachan pranali na to naukarshahi ke shikanje se nikal saki he or na hi pipul friendli ho saki he
 This process is so complex that most people still consider voting to be a mess and a headache
 upar se chunaav ayog chunaav kaaryakramon ko lanbaa karke is puri prakriya ko adhik thakaaoo, ubaau or kharchila banaata ja rahaa he
 Whereas it should have been exactly the opposite
 takanic kaa istemaal aaj jis bade paimaane par chunaav karaane main istemaal ho rahaa he waisi pehle lok sabha chunaav ke vaqt kalpana bhi nahin ho sakati thi
 The use of evms has not only reduced paper usage, but also increased transparency in counting
 matdaan kendron par sisitivi camaron or computaron ke istemaal se real time data mil rahaa he
 The deployment of central security forces is helping to reduce booth capturing and other rigging
 phir bhi usha ji jaise log vot daalane ke apane loktantric adhikaar kaa prayog nahin kar paa rahe hai
 The reason for this is the attitude of the election officials at the lower level
 matadaata suchi taiyaar karne main takanic ke istemaal ko badhaava nahin he
 Nor in casting a vote
 maang uthne lagi he ki logon ko ghar baithe hi internet ke zariye vot daalane kii suvidha muhaiyaa karaane par vichaar kiya jaae
 The process of postal ballot should be simplified
 matdaan kendron kii sankhya badhaai jaae
 The election schedule should be made less complicated and short
 puraa matdaan khatm hone ke saath hi matganana shuru karai jaae or is kaam main teen-chaar dinon kii deree roki jaae
 The tradition of the Election Commission to conduct elections in several stages in the name of difficulty in the movement of security forces has now become common
 lok sabha chhodie, kai rajyon main to vidhansabha chunaav bhi kai charnon main do-do maheenon tak chalate rahete hai
 It may not be possible to get all the elections together, but the commission should move in that direction
 aisa karke wo shaayad usha ji jaise hazaron-lakhon matadaataaon ke loktantr main vishwaas ko majboot hi karegaa or unhen khaali haath ghar lautne se roak sakegaa

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne indore main daudi bohara musalamaanon kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa kii to kai logon kii bhrikutiyaan tan gayi
 This is also because barely two months are left in Madhya Pradesh assembly elections

 This time things were different
 pradhanmantri 14 sitambar ko indore main na sirf bohara musalamaanon ke aadhyatmik pramukh saiyadana mufaddal safuddin se vyaktigat rup se milane gaye, balki unhone duniya ko bataaya ki ismaili shiya sampradaay ke liye unke man main kitna aadar he
 Modi then reached the Saifi Masjid complex near barefoot and later addressed the people there, saying, "his association with this community is very old
 samudaay ne unhen jitna samarthan diya he usase vah abhibhoot hai or isi kaaran indore khinche chale aae
 Describing the Bohra community as his 'family', he said he would use the program being broadcast live on television as an opportunity to make the world "aware of Bohra's contribution to peace, development and harmony"
 Want to dilachasp baat yah he ki gaiyr-bohara samudaay main se sirf pradhanmantri, mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan or unke suraksha daste ko hi us sthal par aane kii anumati di gai thi
 The remaining people were senior male members of the Bohra community
 boharaaon or bahusankhyak muslim sunni samudaay ke bich sambandhon main lambey samay se tanaav chalaa aa rahaa he or indore main narendra modi ke aane se sunni samudaay ke bich unke liye naaraazgi or badi hi hogi
 The number of Bohras is said to be barely 10 lakhs worldwide and the largest of them is the traders of Gujarat society
 madhya pradesh main inaki sankhya ek lakh se adhik nahin hogi or bohara musalmaan chah se bhi kam vidhansabha kshetron ke chunaav parinaamon ko prabhavit karne kii kshamta rakhte hai
 But the community is very prosperous financially
 to pradhanmantri modi aakhir vahaan kyon gaye? vaise to modi ne kaha ki saiyadana ke saath unke puraane sambandh hai or yah yatra un sambandhon ko aage badhaane kaa prayaas he, lekin modi ne isse pehle bhi kai baar aage badhkar musalamaanon ke bich ke chote guton ke saath rishte banane kii pahal kii he
 For example, his support for pakistani-canadian Balewi leader tahir-ul-qadri, who is considered more liberal than Sunni Deobandis
 kuch musalmaan netaa pradhanmantri ke indore daure ko madhya pradesh ke muslim votaron main chunaavon ke pehle foot daalane kii koshish bataa rahe hai
 "if the Prime Minister really wants to be inclusive, he should go to Deoband and Imambara," says Taslim Ahmad Rahmani of the Muslim Political Council of India

 However, even though the Prime Minister's visit to Indore may not be political, it will clearly reflect the impact on the electoral equations

 Calling Dhoni's decision to retire from Test cricket a very bold decision, Kapil Dev said, "dhoni could have easily played 100 Test matches if he wanted to, but he said goodbye to the Test only after 90 Tests irrespective of statistics
" 
 
 kapil kaa kahana he ki jo kaam vah khud yaa unke jaise kai anya cricketer nahin kar sake, dhoni ne vah kar dikhaaya
 Former Test captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni did not score a century or a half-century in his last innings, but his last Test will be remembered for reasons other than his runs, back-to-back catches or stumps
 apane 90wein test ke baad dhoni ne paanch dinon ke clasik cricket ko alavida kaha to sanyas kii vajahon ko lekar kai tarah ke kayaas lagaae gaye or vivaad bhi hue, lekin zyaadaatar jaankaron ne ise dhoni kaa bahut bold faisla mana
 Kapil said, administrators can also learn lessons from what Dhoni has done
 dhoni ko dekhakar ab adhikari 30 saal yaa puri jindagi kursi par jame rahane kaa faisla chhod sakate hai
 He said that the time has come for Team India to consider the policy of two or three captains
 unhone alag-alag formet ke liye alag-alag captain ke rakhe jane ke fomule par vichaar kaa prastaav rakhaa
 He said that such a time may come when the consideration of the non-playing captain in Team India is considered

 anshah1
 Tell me about your childhood and journey to be a storyteller? -the father was a magistrate in the princely state of Gwalior
 chote-chote kasbon main sthanantarit hote rahete the
 Therefore, there was no uniformity in studies
 chauthi kaksha tak ghar main padhai kii
 Enrolled in boys' school in fifth as Kanyasala was only till fourth
 aathvin main thi tab pitaaji kaa sthanantaran hua
 Then had to get eighth private
 un dinon rajya gwalior kii middle pariksha kii bahut manyata thi
 Navami passed from tenth Malav Kanya Vidyalaya, Indore
 un dinon dasvin (metric) skool kii antim kaksha hua karti thi
 After that, they got inter-private
 bie or eme holkar college indaur se kiya
 Chhatra had gained a lot of popularity as a lyricist in his life
 log malwa kii mira kehane lage the
 There was a lot of praise in poet gatherings
 kalantar main geeton kaa yah strot suukh gaya
 i then tried my hand in many genres
 radio ke liye jhalkiyon, vyangy vaartayen likhin
 Wrote stories for children
 ek prayog geet ramayana kaa bhi kiya par vah bahut dur tak nahin gaya
 Also wrote small stories which appeared in Sarita, Niharika, Lahar, Kadambini etc
 dainik akhabaaron ke ravivasriya ankon main bhi kahaniyaan chhapati thim
 a story appeared in Dharmayuga in November 1979, which set me on an all-india stage, and did not look back after that

 Your stories are extremely diverse
 samvednaa, karunaa, samaaj or parivaar he
 How do you choose your plot and characters? Am from middle class family
 sasuraal or pihar donon ore vishaal, lanbaa chaudaa parivaar he
 And what is called close knit in English - both families are the same
 patidev ghor saamaajik praani the
 The number of his friends was also not less
 isaliye paatr or kathanak ke liye mujhe kabhi bhatakana nahin padaa
 Anyway, the sensitive mind of the writer keeps on collecting something from his surroundings inadvertently
 yah saamagree uske avchetan main jamaa hoti rahati he
 While writing a story, a person, something, a topic gets spontaneously remembered and fits into the story
 meraa hameshaa yah prayaas rahaa he ki aasapaas se jo bhi uthaaya he unka mechap is tarah ho ki pahachaane na ja sake
 i never use my writing to capitalize on my raga
 yahaan tak ki paatro ke naamaran main main behad ehtiyaat baratati hum
 i am aware that a familiar name does not go in the wrong context
 3
 Your intention on what is being written in literature these days? - Every era has its own religion, each period has its own merry
 lekhak usee yug dharm ko nibhaataa he
 4
 aajkal ke kathakaar, sahityakar kya apana srijan dharm achche se nibhaa rahe hai?-prayek lekhak kii apni avadharana hoti he, style hoti he
 i do not have the right to comment on that
 yah kaam to samikshakon kaa he
 5
 aapaki kahaniyon main kai pidiyon ko prabhavit kiya
 Why are today's writers not able to leave the same effect? - Overall, the habit of reading is becoming less and less
 manoranjan ke or-or saadhan aa gayi hai
 On this basis, the readers of Hindi are very few
 kshetreey bhashaaon kaa bhi yahi haal he
 English books are being sold
 best celler sabit ho rahi hai
 English has become so dominant that even the younger generation Hindi is writing in English script
 maine kaaryakramon main dekha he, puri kavita roman lipi main likhi hui he or kavi aaraam se suna rahe hai
 Whereas half of the time, like us, is spent in spelling
 6
 Favorite creations of yourself and others? - It is difficult to choose your creations
 phir bhi do chaar naam luungi
 The procession, the stone age, the raga Virag, the moon Amavas, the Punaragamnayach-etc
 amritlal nagar kii maanas kaa hans, shivani ji kii ‘chaudaa phere', mannu bhandari ji kii ‘aapkaa betaa', suryabala ji kaa 'sodhiptr', ashk ji kaa 'girvee deevaaren'- sharad joshi, piel deshpandey or sharat babu kii sari rachanaayen
 Ashapurna Devi also looks good
 sudhaa murti ji kii kahaniyaan bhi prabhavit karti hai
 Now i am not able to read that much, so i avoid saying anything about new writers

 Devendra Fadnavis, the head of the Maharashtra government, took the initiative to bring the ordinance
 unhone centre ke faisle kaa swaagat kar pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa aabhaar vyakt kiya
 Vinod Tawde, Member of the Council of Ministers of State and Minister of State for Education, announced that 2016 medical college dental and government colleges admissions will be NEET free
 jabaki nijee medical kalejon main inhi corces ke liye neet lagu hogi
 Meanwhile, the NCP of Maharashtra has done a different job in the race to take credit
 party se vidhaan parishad main netaa vipaksh dhananjay munde ne twit kar daawa kiya ki adhyadesh unke aagrah kii badaulat jari hua he
 But within 3 hours of its tweet, the party took a U-turn on its role
 munde ne press relies jari kar daawa kiya ki neet ko lekar centre ne maharashtra ke chaatro ke saath insaaf nahin kiya he
 The statement of the Education Minister formed the basis for Munde's response
 tippaniyan Maharashtra Congress also did not want to be seen lagging behind in this credit race
 is dal ne kendriya str par pehle hi likhit main kaha tha ki rajyon ke masalon par gambhirtha se gaur karnaa hoga
 But at the beginning of the ncp's u turn, the Maharashtra Congress, which was in a dilemma, said that the state government failed 60% in the decision to issue the ordinance of the Center
 yah sari bayaanbaji tab ho rahi thi jab centre sarkaar kii cabinet main neet exam ko lekar do adhyadesh laane par keval sahmati bani he

 lekin ensipi ke you turn par shuruyaat main asamanjas main khadi maharashtra congress ne kah diya ki centre ke adhyadesh jari karne ke faisle main rajya sarkaar 60% fail ho gai
 All this rhetoric was happening when the Union Government's cabinet only agreed to bring two ordinances on NEET exam

 It included such women who wanted to get out of the house and do something for the society

 In the morning, the women leave the group with some men and take a rickshaw-trolley and whistle in the streets of the village
 gaanv ke har ghar se kooda ikattha karti hai
 Gathers separately: Talking about garbage, dry and wet garbage is kept separately

 One is red and one is green
 laal rang kii baaltee main sookhaa kooda to vahiin hare rang kii baaltee main geela kooda ko rakhaa jaataa he
 With the help of a private organization called Water Aid, preparations are also being made to make organic manure from wet waste

 gram pradhan gyanendra singh ne bataaya ki jab ham logon ne is gaanv ko khule shouch se mukt kiya (odief, gaanv) to mahilaon ne ek or cheez thaan lee or bolaa ki abhi to hamaara gaanv khule main shouch se mukt hua he, to pradhan ji kyon naa ham log har ghar se nikalne vaala jo sookhaa or geela kooda-kachra he, ise bhi nistarit kiya jaae
 i liked the fact that its training was conducted under the Water Aid private organization
 water aid ke log aakar in logon ko motivet kiye, ham logon ne ek haritha swayan sahaayta samooh mahilaon kaa banaaya, jisamen 11 mahilaayein thi
 First these people were given training
 in 11 mahilaon main se 5 mahilaayein is kaam main lagakar safai abhiyaan main bad-chadhakar hissaa le rahi hai
 Women sort through the dry and wet garbage that has become one of our centers

 masik aay inaki ek ghar se 60 rupee ho jaati he
 All these women are in green saris
 yah log khush rahati hai ki hamaara gaanv saaf ho rahaa he, svachh ho rahaa he
 You go to any nursing home 10 km from here, you will not find any person from our village, in that nursing home because diseases do not arise due to cleanliness
 videshi bhi kar chuke hai visitomahilaon kaa kahana he ki jab ham log baahar jate the kisi videshi ko dekhte the or usko dekhte hi rahete the
 But i got the privilege of these women and villagers that people from around seven-eight countries came here after the open defecation free and garbage waste management program
 euke, dakshin korea, australia,america or africa jaise deshon se log is gaanv main aae
 Gram Pradhan said that Vivek Kumar and Neelima Gupta, who are the trainers of the Water Aid organization, told the scavengers about the SLRM, which is called Solid Liquid Residual Management
 unhone bataaya ki kaise ghar se nikalne vaala kooda he usko aap alag-alag chhanta ja saktaa he
 Those who remain wet will make manure after sorting it
 kudon ke bhi milte hai daamaunhone kaha ki jo sookhaa kooda he usko alag karke usko market main bench denge
 The income generated from it will generate employment
 adhiktar mahilaayein is kaam se judakar isko aage badha rahi hai
 a center has been set up in the village for wet and dry litter, where after collecting garbage from homes, the center is sorted with wet and dry litter
 hamanen graminon se bhi baat kii to unka kahana he ki jab log kooda uthaane aate hai, to bahut acha lagata he
 Like what happens in the city, now we are also in the village

 Then its compost is made from garbage
 jo sookhaa kooda hota he, jaise plastic ke avshesh, bottle or metal inhen alag kar liya jaataa he
 They also earn their income by selling them to junk people

 2 lakh ton pyaaj aayaat karne ke khaadya mantralay ke nirnay ko manjuuri de di
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman gave this information in a press conference after the cabinet meeting
 bataa den, isse pehle khaadya evam upabhokta maamalon ke mantri ramvilas paswan ne 16 november ko kaha tha ki sarkari company mmatisi ke jariye sarkaar ek lakh ton pyaaj kaa aayaat karegi
 The government has also approved private imports to improve onion availability and has also simplified the provisions for polarization and sanitation
 sarkaar ne yah kadam aise samay uthaaya he jab gharelu bazaar main pyaaj kii kami se daam aasmaan par pahunch gaye hai
 Retail prices of onions in Delhi reached Rs 60 per kg
 kharif satr 2019-20 main pyaaj utpaadan main 26 pratishat giravat ke kaaran yah sankat utpann hua he
 Apart from ensuring imports, the government has taken several steps including restricting exports, fixing stock limits
 neshnal herald mudde ko lekar buudhvaar ko bhi sansad ke donon sadanon main jabardast hangaamaa hua
 In the Lok Sabha, Congress leader Mallikarjun Khadke questioned the government's policies and said that the opposition is being intimidated
 unhone kaha ki sansad main jo kuch bhi ho rahaa he vah sarkaar kii niyat kaa virodh he
 Amid the uproar, Kharge said, 'there are two laws in the country at this time
 satta pakshaur vipaksh donon ke liye alag-alag kanoon hai
 The government has bad intentions and is adopting a policy of repression
 isi baat kaa virodh vipaksh kar rahaa he
 Appealing to Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, he said, "do not remove our words from action
" ''sansad main court ko dhamka rahi he congress'congress kevirodh par sawaluthate hue sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha ki vipaksh bina vajah hangaamaa kar rahaa he
 The government is ready to discuss every issue, but those people are wasting time
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki neshnal herald cese main sarkaar kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 Congress is threatening the court in Parliament

 Later the House was adjourned till two o'clock for the third time
 congress saansadon ne sadan main jamkar narebaaji kii
 The Congress created a ruckus here, accusing the government of doing revenge politics
 bharat ke agle pradhanmantri narendra modi kii yatra ek aise vyakti kii asaadhaaran gaatha he, jisaki virodhiyon ne jitani laanat malamat kii utana hi uske samarthakon ne use chaha
 Whose supporters say that he is the one who will take the country out of the mess
 narendra modi ko satta ke sheersh par pahunchane vaale unke athak or lakshya kendrit chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan unhone kaha tha, 'mujhe vishwaas he ki ishwar ne mujhe chunaa he
 During his tremendous election campaign, 63-year-old Modi himself felt with his own eyes the storm of Congress opposition and also the strong support of the NDA
 taanashaah hone ke aarope ko khaarij karte hue modi ne prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan kaha tha ki vah team work main vishwaas rakhte hai or jo log unke saath kaam kar chuke hai vah jaanate hai ki vah ek majboot ichhashakti vaale nirnay lene vaale vyakti hai
 Modi accused his opponents of making very vague, personal and useless accusations for attacking him, calling them dictators, divisive and extremely fanatical
 unka kahana tha ki unke khilaaf bhrashtachar, bhai-bhatijawad yaa aksham hone jaisaa koi bhi gambhir aarope nahin he
 Modi, who is an outsider in the 'delhi Club' of the party's central leadership, in a way, by raising more seats than the majority needed for the BJP to form a government at the Center, all the opposition within and outside the party
 Told defying bijepi ne unke netritv main jabardast bahumat praapt karne kaa aisa karnama anjaam diya he, jaisaa 1984 main rajeev gandhi ke netritv main congress ne 400 se zyada siton par jeet darj kar kiya tha or aisa is bich koi bhi anya dal nahin kar paaya
 Despite facing opposition from senior party leaders like LK Advani and others, 63-year-old Sangh Pracharak Modi campaigned tirelessly across the country for the sixteenth Lok Sabha election, riding on which the Bharatiya Janata Party performed its best ever did
 desh kii raajnneeti main pichley teen dashak se maujuud rahi, party abhi tak kabhi itani shandaar jeet darj nahin kar pai thi
 Modi was also strongly opposed when he was announced as the party's prime ministerial candidate in September, but this opposition did not deter him from his goal of re-inducting the BJP after 2004
 shuruyaat main is baat ko lekar kaaphi andeh jataayaa gaya tha ki modi varisht bhaajapa netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi ke prabhamandal kii barabari kar paaenge yaa nahin
 Vajpayee was considered too much of a rival by his rivals and because of him, the allies would also join the NDA
 lekin, bijepi ne modi par puraa bharosa kiya or us bharose ke badale main party ko chunaav se purv hi pehle se zyada dalon kaa sahyog milanaa shuru ho gaya
 Particularly for the parties that broke away from the NDA by blaming Modi for the 2002 Gujarat riots
 duusare dal yaa unke virdohi beshak modi ko samaaj ko baantne vaale, dhruvikaran karne vaale or kattar hindutvvaadi or gujarat ke musalmaan virdohi dange ke liye aaropee jaise sambodhano se sambodhit karte hon, lekin modi ke samarthak unhen 'ek aisa majboot netaa' maanate hai, jo kabhi bhi vipakshiyon dwaara apanaai jane vaali tushtikaran kii raajnneeti nahin karegaa
 During his nearly 12-year tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi has carved out his image as a leader who has an alternative approach to running the rule of a country struggling with 'policy inertia' over the years
 apane prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan vikaas ko apana mukhya mudda banaate hue modi ne desh kii yuva shakti, madhyavarg or gramin logon ko 'badlaav kii bayaar' laane kaa bharosa dilaane ke liye sampark saadhane kii purajor koshish kii or shaayad unki yahi koshish rang laai, haalanki bich-bich main kabhi kabhaar bhagava takaton ke kuch pasandida vishyon ko uthaakar matadaataaon kaa dhruvikaran karne kii koshishen bhi unke abhiyaan main dikhin
 Modi, a skilled planner, completed the journey from a tea seller at the railway station to a popular leader in India, although many of his opponents do not agree with his claim that he never sold tea
 sangh parivaar kii 'hindutv kii prayogshaala' maane jane vaale rajya main modi ne mukhyamantri ke taur par apni chhavi ek kattarpanthi kii banaai thi, jo lagaataar teen baar chunaav dar chunaav apni vijay kaa paracham laharaata rahaa
 In order to gain the support of minorities, especially Muslims, in the Lok Sabha elections, he consciously abandoned his hardline Hindutva image and focused his attention on the developmental issues, especially the development of poor Muslims
 party kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa pratyaashee ghoshit kiye jane ko lekar hue virodh se beparwaah modi ne aam chunaav ke liye chaturaai se ek aisa athak or hitech prachaar abhiyaan chalaaya jaisaa pehle kabhi nahin dekha gaya
 Under this campaign, he addressed more than 450 rallies across the country
 gujarat ke mehsana ke aitihaasik wadnagar shahar main pichde 'modh ghanchi' (taili) samudaay main janmen modi kaa ubhaar ek asaadhaaran ghatana he, haalanki unke bahut se virdohi unke pichde samudaay se sambhddha hone kii baat ko bhi nahin maanate

 Former Information and Broadcasting Minister of the country Manish Tiwari says that Narendra Modi and his party BJP have cheated the public by making false promises in the elections
 aaj tak ke kaarykram 'sidhi baat' main manish tiwari ne modi sarkaar par or bhi kai gambhir aarope lagaae
 He said, 'narendra Modi made false promises during the election
 janata ko yah kyon nahin bataaya tha ki mahangaai par kaabo paane ke liye kade kadam uthaane honge
 Many essentials will become expensive
 sabase jaruri yah he ki modi sarkaar ko apane kade faislon kii jimmedaari leni hogi
 Now he should stop blaming the UPA and its policies for his decisions
 'manish tiwari ne aage kaha, 'is sarkaar ne maatr ek maheene main kai galtiyaan kii hai
 In times to come, this government will face many difficulties, and in such times the Congress will be united again

 Modi's invitation to PM Nawaz Sharif at the swearing-in ceremony was termed by the Congress leader as a double character of the BJP
 unhone kaha, 'bijepi jo bolti he vah karti nahin
 For the last 10 years, the BJP used to say that terrorism and dialogue cannot happen together, but Modi came to invite Nawaz without coming up with a solution to terrorism
 unke is faisle se pakistan ke kuch sanghathanon ko galat sandesh gaya he
 These organizations feel that the bjp's tough attitude against terror was just electoral propaganda
 ''sidhi baat' kaarykram main manish tiwari ne congress or rahul gandhi se jude sawaalon kaa bhi jawaab diya
 Excerpts from the interview
 
 Question: What do you think about the issue of Rahul Gandhi taking a vacation? Manish Tiwari - Every person has his own style and works according to that
 rahul gandhi par lagaae ja rahe aarope bebuniyaad hai
 Many people who work in twenty four hours do the other person in four hours, so working longer does not mean that you are very capable
 zyada der kaam karne kaa matlab ye bhi ho saktaa he aap bahut zyada kaabil nahin he
 Because you are not able to work in the scheduled time for office
 prakritik niyam he ki vyakti kuch der kaam karata he or kuch samay aaraam karata he
 Therefore to say that a person takes leave, does not take, his ability to work is more, less it is absolutely baseless charge
 sawaalh kya rahul gandhi modi ko haraa paaenge?manish tiwari-congress party ke kaaryakartaaon or netaaon kaa manobal nahin gira hua he
 But there is a thinking that for ten years we ran the government, creative work was done in the government
 uske baavjood ye haar hui he
 There is a need to worry very seriously about the reasons for the defeat
 or aise kadam uthaane kii zarurat he jisase ham logon kaa bharosa jeet sake, to iskaa ye matlab nahin he ki manobal gira hua he
 Question: Mallikarjun was made the Leader of the Opposition, he should have said in the Lok Sabha that i will give Modi, do not want to fight, nor want to fight
 chuttee manaanaa chaahate hai
 
 
 
 
 If Manish Tiwari-leader becomes the opposition then you will start accusing him of dynasty
 hamane dalit samudaay se aane vaale ek varisht netaa ko vipaksh kaa netaa banaaya
 If Rahul Gandhi has the post of vice president, it does not mean that he should also have the post of Leader of the Opposition
 netaa vipaksh kisi or ko isliye banaaya he ki sansad kaa kaam bhi aasaani se chal sake or party kaa purnirmaan ho sake
 Your allegations are absolutely baseless and you will see in the coming months, as this government will make a mistake, if you analyze a month before this, then this government will face a lot of difficulties in the coming days
 or us samay congress ek rachanaatmak vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaati milegi
 Question: First the children of Rahul Gandhi and his Priyanka Gandhi
 
 Similarly, the Congress will continue to lead
 manish tiwari-nehru gandhi parivaar congress party se ek bhaavnaatmak rup se judaa hua he
 Question: The title itself is not enough to run the country
 manish tiwari-main aapaki baat maanane ke liye bilkul taiyaar hum
 Not only the title, there has also been solid work
 1999 se lekar 2004 tak sonia gandhi ne jis tarah netritv kiya tha or jis tarah sampradayik shaktiyon kaa virodh kiya tha
 That is why in 2004 the Congress Party was able to form UPA and our government was formed
 to keval sarnem kii vajah se nahin tha, unhone pradhanmantri kaa pad bhi tyaagaa
 And stood on it for ten years
 isliye ye kahana ki congress sirf ek parivaar or vanshavaad main vishwaas rakhti he

 lekin iske liye unhen anshan or bhukh hadtaal nahin karnaa chahie
 Singh said that we are against bringing the judiciary under the purview of Lokpal
 isse uski aazaadee chhin jaaegi
 But the judiciary also has accountability and for that we are bringing an accountability bill
 unhone aage kaha ki desh ke liye bahut kuch kiya gaya he, lekin abhi bahut kuch karnaa baaki he

 com / 69svl3qe1j In Shahdara, East Delhi, the brothers killed their immediate brother for property
 bujurg kii itani pitayee kiki aakhirkaar usne aspataal main ilaaj ke dauraan apana dam tod diya
 According to the information, a person named Virendra lived with his family and ran an electronic showroom in Gorakh Park, Shahdara
 uski sage bhaaiyon ajay or raaj sharma se aaye din property ko lekar vivaad chalata rahata tha
 This was not the only reason for the relationship with the brothers to deteriorate
 mritak ke bete rahul kaa kahana he ki bank se bhi unke chaachaaon ne frod tareeke se lagbhag 200 karod kaa lone le rakhaa he
 Which he was unable to repay and due to which his eyes always remained on the property of his elder brother
 isi ke chalate 21 april ko bhaaiyon ne apane bade bhai virendra par dandon sariyon se tabadatod waar kar die
 In which the elderly person was badly injured
 jiske baad use jitibhospataal pahunchaaya gaya or gambhir haalat ko dekhte hue maiks hospital le gaye, lekin 2 din ke ilaaj ke baad aakhirkaar unhone apana dam tod diya
 The 5 victim families have raised many serious questions over the police action
 parivaar kaa kahana he ki bhaaiyon kii dhamkee ke chalate unhone pehle bhi police main shikaayat darj karai he lekin police ne kabhi isko gambhirtha se nahi liya
 At the same time, after taking the case in light streams, no action was taken against the accused, but now after the death of the victim, the police has registered a murder case but the accused is still out of the custody of the police
 chunaav ayog kii electronic voting mashin (iviem) main gadabadi kar mashin ko hack karne kii chunauti main shanivaar ko antim samay main koi raajnneetik dal shaamil nahin hua
 After the Commission expressed its reluctance to hack the machine, representatives of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Communist Party of india-marxist (CPI-M), who were involved in an open challenge to hack the evms, said that the Commission has accepted the universal acceptance of evms
 Proves it
 mukhya chunaav ayukta naseem jaidi ne bataaya ki ayog dwaara yojit khuli chunauti main sirf ensipi or makapa ne hissaa liya tha
 However, representatives of both parties who came to participate in the challenge requested to clear some of the misconceptions related to the technical aspects of the machine instead of hacking evms
 ayog ne 12 may ko iviem main gadabadi kii shikayaton ko lekar yojit sarvadaleey baithak ke baad sabhi manyata praapt rashtriya or rajya stareey raajnneetik dalon ko khuli chunauti main shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 But only two parties (NCP and CPI-M) applied in the deadline set on May 26 to accept the challenge to be held on June 3
 jaidi ne bataaya ki ayog ne chunauti ke liye haal hi main sampann paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main 12 vidhansabha kshetron main istemaal kii gayi 14 mashiinon ko hack karne ke liye daavedaaron ko muhaiyaa karaane ke liye chunaa tha
 He said that according to his demand that both the parties expressed reluctance to hack the machine, the members of the committee of technical experts of the Commission informed the representatives of both parties in detail about the technical aspects of EVM

 gathbandhan sarkaar chalaane ke congressi taur-tareekon par rashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) ke ‘gambhir etraj’ jataane ke kaaran samprag sarkaar ke matbhed sataha par aa gaye
 The speculation of his resignation was further strengthened by NCP President and Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar and Heavy Industries Minister Praful Patel not going to his ministry
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh or samprag adhyaksh sonia gandhi se pavaar kii baatcheet ke baavjood ab tak yah gatirodh kaayam he or rakanpa ne aage kii ranneeti tay karne ke liye party kii baithak somvaar ko bulaai he
 On the other hand, both the Prime Minister and the Congress Party tried to resolve the matter by describing Pawar as their very useful ally
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne naaraaz sharad pavaar se sampark kiya or unhen ‘behad upyogi sahyogi’ bataaya lekin is baat kaa koi sanket nahin he ki congress netritv rakanpa kii chintaaon ke niraakaran ke liye kya karne ja rahaa he
 At the same time, the Congress did not give much weight to the deadlock with NCP, saying that NCP chief Sharad Pawar is a senior and respected leader of UPA and all issues with the party will be resolved through dialogue
 pavaar or unki party ke sahyogi prafull patel ke virodh swaroop mantrimandal kii baithak main hissaa nahin lene ke ek din baad rakanpa pramukh ne party kii shikayaton par charchaa ke liye congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii
 Interestingly, angry Pawar went to meet UPA and Congress President Sonia Gandhi in the private car of his MP daughter Supriya Sule
 ise mantri pad se unke istife kii atkal ko bal mila
 Agriculture Minister Pawar and his partner Heavy Industries Minister Praful Patel did not go to his ministry on Friday
 pavaar ne baad main apni party ke varisht sahyogiyon ke saath mantranaa kii
 After this, Patel said that the NCP is unhappy about the functioning of the government and the operation of the alliance and it has been conveyed to the Congress leadership
 patel ne kaha ki samprag-do sarkaar apane kaarykaal ke antim do varshon’ main pravesh kar rahi he or rakanpa chaahati he ki sarkaar janata se jude muddon par ‘or nirnaayak’ tathaa ‘adhik patibaddh’ bane
 He said, 'we have some issues on which we want some change
 ’ unhone kaha ki party samprag kaa hissaa bani rahegi
 Patel dismissed reports that Pawar was angry at not being given the number two position in the government
 party kii shikayaton ke nivaaran ke liye gend ko congress ke paale main daalane ke baad party is mudde par bhavi niti-reeti tay karne ke liye somvaar ko baithak karegi
 The Congress, while not giving much weight to the deadlock with NCP, said that NCP chief Sharad Pawar is a senior and respected leader of UPA and all issues with the party will be resolved through dialogue
 congress mahasachiv evam media vibhaag ke pramukh janardan dvivedi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘hamaari najaron main sharad pavaar ek varisht or sammanit netaa hai
 He is seen with this same respect in the UPA
 ’ dvivedi ne yah bhi kaha ki koi gambhir samasya nahin he or samaadhaan nikal aayegaa
 Expressing unease in the party, a senior NCP leader said there was a lack of consultation with allies and lack of coordination committee to address those issues
 unhone kaha ki congress ke gathbandhan ke saathiyon ko saath lekar nahin chalane ke kaaran prashasnic or raajnneetik mudde jamaa hote gaye
 These things were included in the letter sent by Pawar to Singh last night
 congress ke puraane sahyogi ne sawaal kiya, ‘kya gathbandhan ke sahyogi sirf mantralay yaa apane mahakme tak simit hai
 Why they are not included in a decision
 ’unhone kaha, ‘meri party ko kabhi mahasoos nahin hua ki jo mantralay or mahakme hamaare paas hai, sarkaar main usase itar bhi hamaari koi bhoomika he
 The party leader said that the issue of setting up the UPA Coordination Committee was also raised by the NCP but it was not implemented
 istife ke babat poochne par patel ne kaha, ‘abhi tak hamane aupchaarik taur par na to istipha diya he or na hi use manjuur karne kaa koi sawaal he
 The issue is not resignation
 sirf pradhanmantri ko patr bheja gaya he
 Patel strongly stated that his leader Pawar has his own personality and has been placed after number two in the government, Pranab Mukherjee
 unhone kaha, ‘pavaar itane tuchh netaa nahin hai jo khud is tarah kii choti baat karen
 Our issues are big
 number do kii haisiyat kii baat badha-chadhaakar pesh kii ja rahi he
 Owing to his personality, Pawar has been sitting (in Parliament) after Sonia Gandhi and (in Cabinet meetings) after Pranab Mukherjee

 " pradhanmantri manmohan singh par ek baar phir nishaanaa sadhate hue varisht bhaajapa netaa laalkrishna adwani ne kaha ki vah sabase kamjor pradhanmantri hai jiske chalate unki sarkaar main ‘kai ang niskriy hone ke baad ant najadik’ hone ke lakshan dikhaai de rahe hai
 The Prime Minister is weak and indecisive: Advani: Two days ago, the Prime Minister had asked Advani not to use harsh language against him
 adwani ne samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki pradhanmantri ne kaha he ki hamen kade shabdon kaa istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 What harsh words did i say? i only said that Manmohan Singh is the weakest of all Prime Ministers, from Jawaharlal Nehru
 yah ek raajnneetik tippanee he
 Where is the toughness in this? Avoid strong words Advani: Manmohan Singh, insisting on not withdrawing his statement, the BJP leader said that the Prime Minister says he is hurt because i called him the weakest Prime Minister
 agar vaastaviktaa ko vaise hi bayaan karnaa anuchit he to main doshi hum lekin maine nahin balki ucchtam nyaayalay ne kaha he ki 2ji ghotaale se bachaa ja saktaa tha or yadi manmohan singh ji ne sakriyata dikhaai hoti to rajkosh ko hone vaale 1
 An estimated loss of Rs 76 lakh crore could have been prevented
 congress par bhi itnaa hi kadaa rukh akhriyaar karte hue purv up pradhanmantri ne kaha ki har din guzarane ke saath samprag sarkaar main ant najadik hone ke sabhi lakshan dikhaai de rahe hai, jiskaa netritv naam se to manmohan singh kar rahe hai lekin niyantran sonia gandhi kar raheen hai
 Advani comes on Manmohan Tarasadvani said that many former UPA ministers are in Tihar on corruption charges, others are queuing up to go there
 pradhanmantri kii khud kii party ke varisht mantri saarvajanik rup se ek duusare kii aalochana kar rahe hai or virodhabhasi baat kar rahe hai
 He said that the most powerful general secretary of the ruling party makes such statements daily which other leaders of the party regularly have to refute
 kisi rogi main is tarah kii sthiti ko kai angon kaa niskriy hona kaha jaataa he
 Advani said that UPA allies like the Trinamool Congress are keeping a distance from the Manmohan Singh government, whose unpopularity is increasing
 haalanki ve is vakt apni hataasha ko saarvajanik nahin karnaa chaahate
 On Thursday, LK Advani's Jan Chetna Yatra said that Trinamool Congress president Mamata Banerjee is silent about the scams? Today, he said that he is missing Mamata's impeccable statements
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki samprag ke bheetar matbhedon ke mul main desh kii suniyojit lut ke khilaaf janata kaa badhata gussa he
 He said that the United Progressive Alliance should be called a 'divided progressive alliance'
 adwani ne kaha ki 2ji, rashtramandal, adarsh, air india or kai anya ghotaale is baat ke udhaaharan hai
 The image of India is currently at the bottom of the world as the coalition running the regime is synonymous with corruption
 apni party ke netaa or karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri bi es yediurppa ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aaropon par adwani ne kaha ki jahaan tak hamaari party kii baat he ham bhrashtachar ke aaropon par kabhi naram nahin rahe
 We asked him to resign as soon as the Lokayukta report came
 unhone kaha ki congress kii chhavi sarkaar ke ucch staron par baari bharkam bhrashtachar karne vaali party kii banane ke chalate rakanpa ke gusse ke kaaran kendriya krishi mantri sharad pavaar ne sonia gandhi ke mahatvakankshi khaadya suraksha vidheyak ke khilaaf taaja bayaan diya he
 On the issue of an estimated Rs 25 lakh crore of black money allegedly deposited in Swiss bank, the BJP leader hoped that the government would clarify its steps to stop black money and bring it back from foreign banks

 The film was also given 2 National Awards and Filmfare Awards along with the compliment
 ab isaki agali kadi 'jolly elelbi 2' banakar taiyaar he jisamen arshad varsi kii jagah akshay kumaar lead role main hai
 The film has been released with 4 cuts following a court order
 lakhanu main hui he jolly elelbi2 kii shootingdekhen iskaa rivyuu :lakhanu se he kahaneeyah kahani lakhanu besd he jahaan vakil jagdishwar mishra urf jolly (akshay kumaar) apni patni puspa pandeya (huma kuraishi) or bachche ke saath rahata he
 Jolly is famous throughout the court, according to his cheerful nature

 Because of this, Justice Sunderlal Tripathi (saurabh Shukla) is also very upset
 phir kahani main twist tab aata he jab hina siddiki (sayaani gupta) kaa cese court ke saamne aata he or kahani main ikbaal kasim (maanav kaul), inspector singh (kumud mishra) jaise kirdaaron kii entry hoti he or aakhri cese court main ladate vakt jolly ke saamne nami vakil pramod maathur (annu kapur) hote hai

 - Saurabh Shukla, Annu Kapoor, Inamul Haque, Kumud Mishra have done a good job in the film
 huma kuraishi bhi sahaj rahi hai
 Watch how the trailer of 'jolly LLB 2' - the exchange of dialogues and especially the court room drama make you laugh as well as draw attention to the serious issue
 - film kii cinemetography or screenple badhiya he
 There are many sequences of the film that bring a smile to your face
 kamjor kadiyaan-- film main kahani lakhanu se banaras or jammu kashmir jaati he jo ki film kii raftaar ko dhimaa karata he
 - The court sequence also drags too long which could be shortened
 - first or second half thode dhime hai
 This speed could have been better
 - court room drama acha he or mazaakia bhi
 But there is no flow in it
