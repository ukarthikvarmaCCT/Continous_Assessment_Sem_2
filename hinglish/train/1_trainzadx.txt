 donon ne bataaya ki kis tarah aaj bhi nai peedi main aise lekhak hai jo hindi main likhnaa pasand karte hai
 Director of Rajkamal Prakashan Group, Alind Maheshwari said that even today the content is huge, marketing benefits you to some extent
 lekin agar bade phaayde ko dekhen to contate ke dam par hi lekhak or kitaaben aage chalati hai
 Meera Johri of Rajpal & Sons said that Hindi is coming to a edge today
 pichley kuch samay main hindi main nae lekhak aae hai, unhen mauka bhi diya gaya he
 He said that writers are very sensitive, content will be good only if the future is there
 sahitya ajtak: 'wo bhagava-haraa chillaayenge, tum tirange par ade rahanaa'mira johari ne kaha ki content king he, lekin marketing bhi jaruri he
 He said that the editorial group of the publisher can only give suggestions to the writer, that too with the words but the decision of the author is the last
 unhone kaha ki contate par lekhak kii chalati he, lekin cover par prakaashak kii bhi chalati he
 Meera Johri said that people still think that Hindi books will be cheap, people can buy English book for 1000 rupees but do not take Hindi book for 300 rupees

 They gave me a report that claimed that coke contains much less pesticides than other cold drinks
 maine apane vakil se alag-alag 25 product lab main jaanch ke liye bhejne ko kaha
 Products like tea, milk contained pesticides to incredible levels

 How long our thinking will be such that this man will do something about us, till then nothing will change

 With the end of the seventh and last phase of voting on Sunday, the exit poll results have started coming
 agsit pole kii maane to is baar congress ko kul 77-108 siten mil sakati hai
 The Congress is constantly struggling to get power and in such a situation it is of no use to break away from the Grand Alliance
 kyonki ye aankada akele congress kaa nahin he balki upie gathbandhan kaa he
 In 2014, the UPA got a total of 44 seats
 ab puraane aakade se thodaa sa hi upar uthi he
 Uttar Pradesh, which has the highest number of seats in the country, has a total of 80 Lok Sabha seats and from here goes the way of the Prime Minister of the country
 agsit pole ke mutabik, upi main congress ko 1-2 siten hi milengi
 Earlier, there were also speculations of the Congress going with the SP-BSP alliance, but the alliance could not happen due to seat sharing
 ajtak ke agsit pole ke mutabik upi main espi-bispi 10-16 siten milengi
 This means that in front of the Modi wave, once again the dream of the grand alliance of the opposition parties was defeated
 ab tak 35 main se 34 agsit pole khare utre hai
 This exit poll will also indicate that how much profit or loss did the Congress fighting by breaking away from the Grand Alliance? However, let us tell you that these are just exit polls, which give an estimate and a hint

 Except Bihar, the Congress is not part of the 'grand alliance'
 party sirf upie ke ghatak dalon ke saath hi chunaav maidan main he
 Even if the Congress did not find a place in the grand alliance formed by the SP-BSP and RLD in the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, there was no match with Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress in West Bengal
 sirf bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan se rajd ke saath chalaa aa rahaa congress kaa gathbandhan is loksabhaa chunaav main bhi barkaraar he
 Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi have said that in UP, the Congress will do well on its own

 special public prosicuter ujjwal nikam ne 'aaj tak' se baatcheet main kaha he ki pakistan main kaid or faansee kii sajaa sunaae gaye bhartiya naagarik or purv nausena ke adhikari kulbhushan jadhav kii rihaai ke liye vah pakistan jaakar cese ladane ko bhi taiyaar hai
 During a conversation with Aaj Tak in Pune, Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said that Pakistan is a Banana Republic and a country with unstable government
 ujjwal nikam ne kaha ki unhen pakistan ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar sartaaj ajij ke us bayaan par tajjub hua jisamen unhone kaha ki faansee kii sajaa sunaae gaye kulbhushan jadhav ko kisi se bhi milane nahin de sakate
 Ujjwal Nikam said that no person, who is sentenced to death, should not give counselor access to that person, it proves that Jadhav confession taken by Pakistan has been taken under pressure
 isliye kahin pakistan kii pole na khul jaae wo use kisi se milane nahin dena chaahate
 Jadhav must have been tortured while confessing his statement and when this truth comes out, Pakistan will be exposed again to the world
 edwocket nikam ne kaha pakistan kaa kanoon, nyaayik prakriya hindustan ke kanoon vyavastha kii jaisi he, isliye kisi bhi vyakti kaa bayaan agar marpet kar liya gaya he to kanoon kii bhashaa main uske kuch myne nahin or isliye pakistan, jadhav se kisi ko milane dene ko taiyaar nahin he
 Jadhav may not be alive at all! Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam also feels that maybe Kulbhushan Jadhav may have been tortured, brutalized and Jadhav may not be alive at all
 isliye pakistan unhen kisi se milwane kii haalat main nahin he or bahaane bana rahaa he
 He says that Jadhav should get counselor access so that Jadhav's confessional statement was made by himself or he was forcefully taken from it
 ujjwal nikam ne kaha ki jadhav isliye nirdosh he kyonki iran sarkaar ne bhi kaha ki kulbhushan jadhav iran main apane vyavsaay ke sambandh main kaam kar rahe the
 Against Pakistan, Hindustan has taken strict steps in this case, to avoid this, Pakistan has come out with such false statements that Jadhav is an Indian spy
 trump kahen to jadhav maamle main ritrial kar saktaa he paintarashtriya str par bharat ko kis tarah ke kadam uthaane chahie isapar edwocket ujjwal nikam ne bataaya ke hindustan ek aisa desh he jo loktantr kaa sammaan sahi myne main kiya jaataa he, isi kaaran se ajmal kasaab jaise khoonkhaar aatanki ko kanoonee ladaai ladane ke liye do-do vakil die the
 Pakistan is adopting its obstinate attitude
 is pechida sthiti main bharat ko america ke trump baba ko samajhnaa hoga ki jis pakistan ko america lagaataar madad karte chalaa aa rahaa he wo asthir pakistan kaise aatankwaad ko badhaava de rahaa he
 If Trump agrees, then Pakistan will have to listen to America
 UN kii dekharekh main ho kanoonee karrwiedwocket ujjwal nikam ne anurodh kiya he ki jadhav cese ko dobaaraa, nae sire se pakistan kii nyaaypalika main ladaa jaae, taaki is kanoonee karrwai ko indian consulate or sanyukt raashtra sanghatan kaa pratinidhi najar rakh sake, jisase duniya ko vishwaas ho ki pakistan ne jadhav ko khud ko begunaah sabit karne kaa puraa mauka diya
 Advocate Ujjwal Nikam challenged Pakistan to go to Pakistan and advocated Jadhav
 agar pakistan main nae sire se jadhav kaa cese kii sunwaayee kii jaaegi to wo khud pakistan main jaakar kulbhushan jadhav kaa cese ladenge kyonki pakistan kaa koi bhi vakil jadhav ko kanoonee madad dene ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 That is why Advocate Ujjwal Nikam is willing to go to Pakistan and plead for Jadhav in a Pakistani court
 nikam ko vishwaas he ki wo jadhav ko nirdosh sabit karke hindustan waapas laaenge kyonki unhen pataa he ki pakistan ke paas jadhav ke khilaaf koi bhi saboot nahin he, lekin hindustan ko antarashtriya str par badnaam karne ke liye pakistan ne ye nai chaal chali he
 Pakistan will not allow Ujjwal Nikam to advocate in Pakistan
 isiilie suraksha parishad ko is maamle main hastkshep karnaa padegaa kyonki pakistan ne maanavadhikaar kaa ulanghan kiya he, geneva kanvension kaa ulanghan kiya he
 In such a situation, how will Jadhav, who is a foreign national, get justice in Pakistan? Senior advocate Nikam said that saving Kulbhushan Jadhav is not the only task
 hindustan kii pratishtha daanv par lagi he or isliye har koi chahega ki doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani ho jaae
 Let the truth be brought before the world
 suraksha parishad ko is maamle main hastkshep karne ke liye bharat ko dabaav bananaa hoga
 Ujjwal Nikam said that Pakistan should tell what evidence it has against Jadhav
 pakistan or hindustan kaa kanoon ek jaisaa he, agar koi aaropee khud ke ikbaalia bayaan se hat jaataa he to aaropee ke khilaaf saboot dena hota he, isiilie jadhav ko duniya ke saamne nahin laayaa ja rahaa he
 If Jadhav is being hanged only for confessional statement, then Pakistan has made this concocted case to defame India

 40 thousand crores
 bharat ne america chetavaniyon ko nazarandaaj karte hue is samjhaute ko aage badhaayaa
 The US is well aware of the circumstances that led it to buy a system like the S-400

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said the batsmen would have to do their best in the fourth and final Test match if they were to stop the 4‚Äì0 whitewash against England
 bhartiya team abhi tak kisi bhi pari main 300 ran ke paar pahunchane main safal nahin rahi
 Dhoni said in this context, 'our team is known because of our batting
 hamaari praathamikta acha score khadaa karke virdohi team par dabaav bananaa hoga
 'india have a strong batting lineup with three top batsmen in the form of Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman
 in teenon ke naam par kul milakar 100 se adhik shatak hai lekin dhoni kaa maananaa he ki ovel test main salaami ballebaajon ko behatar khel dikhaanaa hoga
 Dhoni said, 'we are very much dependent on our openers
 jab bhi hamen acchhee shuruyaat mili hamaare madhyakram ne uskaa puraa phayda uthaakar bada score khadaa kiya
 India's best start in this series was 63 runs

 The return of Virender Sehwag in the third Test match at Edgbaston did not change India's fortunes and the Delhi opener was dismissed for zero in both innings

 He said, 'some things are out of control in cricket
 hamaare paas jo sansaadhan the hamane unka puraa upyog kiya
 It is important to look to the future rather than to panic
 hamen karaari haar mili he iskaa jo bhi kaaran rahaa ho lekin hamen aage ke chamakdaar bhavishya ko dekhne kii jarurat he
 He did not say whether fast bowler Praveen Kumar was fully fit, who was injured while batting in the Edgbaston Test
 praveen ne is bich nets par abhyaas kiya jisase lag rahaa he ki vah antim test match ke liye uplabdh rahenge
 Ishant Sharma, RP Singh and Munaf Patel also bowled but s Sreesanth was not seen bowling on the nets

 notebandi ke ek saal puraa hone par ajtak ke special conklev 'kitna phayda kitna nuksaan' ke pehle satr main kendriya mantri piyush goyal or congress netaa sachin payalat ne shirkat kii
 The session was moderated by Aaj Tak Managing Editor Rahul Kanwal
 sachin payalat ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ne cancer kaa ilaaj karne ke liye notebandi lagu kii lekin mahaj sirdard dur kar vaahvahee lut rahi he
 According to the pilot, the central government banned the currency of 500 and 1000 rupees, claiming that this would curb terrorism along with black money
 lekin payalat ke mutabik, aankadon se saaf he ki lagbhag 99 fisadi karency rigerv bank ke paas waapas pahunch chukaa he or notebandi ke is daur main aatanki ghatnaon main 33 fisadi kaa ijapha darj hua he
 Piyush Goyal said that the scam of crores of Congress party looks just like a mosquito
 goyal ne kaha ki kendra sarkaar ne farvari 2016 main hi cashles iconomi main jane ke liye faisla le liya tha
 In this session, Rahul Kanwal asked whether the increase in the number of taxpayers in the country by demonetisation is not a benefit
 The pilot said that the ban on demonetisation affected the common man and the big crocodiles of the black economy are still intact
 payalat ne notebandi par sawaal uthaate hue poocha ki aakhir notebandi kaa faisla kendra sarkaar ne liya yaa phir rigerv bank ne
 Piyush Goyal said that the way the tax collection has increased in the country due to demonetisation, it will be easy for the government to cut tax rates going forward
 is satr ke agle charan main rahul kanwal ne ajtak kii field report kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki aakhir kyon notebandi se deshbhar main chote-madhyam kaarobaariyon ko bada nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he? piyush goyal ne kaha ki notebandi se sabhi chote or madhyam kaarobaar ko nuksaan nahin hua he
 This is benefiting those sectors who have managed their business as soon as possible
 vahiin jin sectors main abhi bhi puure kaarobaar ko tex ke daayre main laana baaki he unhen bhi aate hi phayda milanaa shuru ho jayega
 Sachin Pilot said that he could not find any small businessman in the country who claimed that he benefited from demonetisation
 payalat ke mutabik aakhir kyon sarkaar ne notebandi ke jo phaayde ginaae vah abhi tak dekhne ko nahin mili
 Pilot asked why the government is not coming forward with figures in support of those claims
 iske jawaab main piyush goyal ne daawa kiya ki notebandi ke baad jis tarah se bijepi ek ke baad ek rajyon main chunaav jeet kar saamne ai he, use notebandi kaa samarthan mana janaa chahie
 So the conclusion is that the whole country is with this decision of the Prime Minister
 ise bhi padhein: paradise papers: jayant sinha kii safai- mantri banane se pehle chhod di thi companypayalat ne kaha ki yah propaganda, prachaar or marketing kii sarkaar he
 On this, Goyal said that if the Modi government had been a government with event management, then in 2014, there would not have been a BJP government in 16 states from the government in 6 states
 rahul kanwal ne sawaal kiya ki kya notebandi se farji karency par lagaam lagi he
 Rahul quoted international agencies as to whether the fake currency had been fully deposited in the bank or whether the counterfeit note was still being counted
 piyush goyal ne kaha ki notebandi ke baad desh main jaali note puri tarah se khatm ho chuki he
 However, Goyal admitted that the Reserve Bank has not yet given any data on the counterfeit note, so it is believed that the count is still going on

 In contrast, the BJP, which came to power after getting the votes of the farmers, has given an affidavit in the Supreme Court that the report of the Swaminathan Commission cannot be implemented

 co / zaus19xclf This will be one of the biggest betel nut given in the country
 supaari ek karod kii
 Betel
 
 To have someone murdered on rent jurm kii duniya kii ye puraani ravaayat he
 But the way the murderer was chosen in this betel nut
 
 The place where the plan to kill Maktool was made and from where the supari killer was caught was all strange
 andhra pradesh ke gramin ilaake main sabakuch thik-thaak tha
 The movement of vehicles from the toll point was also continuing as usual
 lekin tabhi ek taveraa car badi teji se is naake se aage nikalati he or achaanak goliyon kii tadatadaahat se puraa ilaaka gunj uthta he
 The firing was aimed at the Tavera passing through the highway
 takreeban das minute tak is gaadi par andhadhundh goliyon kii bauchhaarein hoti raheen
 During this time no one got out of the car
 iske baad jab hamalaavaron ko yaqeen ho gaya ki ab gaadi main baitha koi bhi shaks jinda nahin bachaa hoga tab kahin jaakar bade aaraam se wo mauka e vaardaat se ravaanaa ho jate hai
 Soon after this horrific incident, the Vijayawada police was on the scene
 car main ek saath teen-teen laashen padi thim
 One corpse on the driver's side seat, while the other two corpses on the rear seat
 lekin haroonges taur par is bhayanak golibari main taveraa kaa driver saaf batch niklaa tha
 The one crore supariwal was that who was this murderer after all? Why did they kill three or three people? After all, what hostility did the slayer have with the dead? And most importantly, where did the murderer escape after this massacre? Obviously the police had to find answers to all these questions
 lihaaja, unhone shuruyaat maranevaalon kii pahchaan pataa karne se kii
 Soon, the number and other details of the vehicle were flashed across the district through wireless and after a brief interrogation of Taftish and the driver, the identity of the three victims of this shootout was cleared
 teenon rishte main sage bhai or phase reeding or jyotish kaa kaam karanevaale kaarobaari the
 As this case was very serious, the police also moved their investigation fast
 agle chand dinon main jaise-jaise police kii tafteesh aage badi ek ke baad ek kai chaunkaanewaali baaten bhi saamne aa gayi
 And one of these things was the betel nut given for this murder
 ji haa, is tripal murder ke liye koi lakh, das lakh nahin
 
 
 Rather, the entire one crore betel nut was given
 yakeenan haal ke dinon main hindustan main kisi kii jaan lene ke liye di gai ye sabase badi supaari thi
 But there were many questions that were yet to be answered
 sawaal ye ki in teen bhaaiyon ke katl ke liye aakhir kisne di ek karod kii supaari? kya thi uski in bhaaiyon se dushmani? kyon puri duniya kii phase reeding karne or takadir bataanevaale ye teen bhai apane hi aane vaale bure vakt kaa pataa nahin laga sake?vijaywada main hui is shootout kii vaardaat se puraa ilaaka saham gaya tha
 The way three brothers were put to death on the middle road together, he stunned everyone
 shootout teen aise bhaaiyon ko, jinhen duniya nagarjun bandhuon ke naam se jaanati thi or jo dusron kaa cheharaa pard kar or jyotishiya vidya ke sahare unki takadir bataaya karte the
 Knowing the fate of others, not his own, it soon became clear in the investigation of the matter that the Nagarjuna brothers had an old enmity with some other face reader brothers of the same area i
e
govindu brothers in the circle of overtaking each other in the business and This enmity was intensified due to the body elections and the friendship between boys and girls on both sides
 lekin nagarjun or govind bandhuon kii dushmani kaa ye pehla anjaam nahin tha
 Rather before this, an incident of murder on 6 April 2014 had triggered bloodshed on both sides
 tab govind bandhuon main se ek gutham durga raav ko kisi ne maut ke ghat utaar diya tha or jaisaa ki shaq tha, tab tafteesh main inhen nagarjun bandhuon kaa naam saamne aayaa tha
 The shooters who were called from Delhi, now the line of investigation for the police, the direction of investigation was almost clear
 yani tripal murder kaa shaq govind bandhuon par hi tha
 But to get involved behind this murder of Govind brothers, the police had yet to gather many evidence
 lekin isi kadi main police ko jo nai baat pataa chali, usase uske kaan khadey ho gaye
 It became clear that the betel nut was given for this shootout for a full Rs
 1 crore and the murderers were hired from Delhi, the capital of the country, to carry it out
 idhar supaari di, udhar laashen bichhindrasal, govind andhra pradesh ke jis jhangalu birdari se taalluk rakhte hai, usee birdari ke kai log dilli main bhi hai
 And this time Govind brothers had decided to take advantage of their relationship to hide Nagarjuna brothers
 unhone dilli main rahanevaale apane rishtedaaron se sampark saadhaa or kuch aise supaari kilors kaa intjaam karne kii baat kahi, jo andhra pradesh main aakar kaam bhi kar jaae or kisi ko kaanon-kaan pataa bhi naa chale
 Now the final match was to be played in this game of checkmate
 or phir idhar ek karod kii supaari ki delivery hui or udhar vijaywada main ek saath teen laashen gir gayi
 a soldier has been martyred in an ongoing encounter with militants in Anantnag in Jammu and Kashmir since Tuesday morning, and two militants have also been killed
 ye donon aatankwaadi gut jaish-e-mohammad se jude hai
 One of these terrorists has been identified as Sajjad Ahmad Bhat, who was the owner of the car used in the suicide attack on the CRPF convoy in Pulwama on 14 February
 duusare aatankwaadi kaa naam tawsiff he, or vah sajaad kaa handler tha
 a search operation was launched by the security forces based on intelligence that the militants were hiding in the area, which soon turned into an encounter when the militants opened fire on the forces
 bataaya gaya he ki muthbhed ab bhi jari he
 Significantly, on Monday, terrorists targeted an army vehicle through the IED in Pulwama, where in February this year, the jaish-e-mohammad suicide bomber targeted the Convoy of CRPF, in which more than 40 soldiers were martyred
 they were finished

 This has led to an increase in formalizing the economy, but not by increasing the formal sector, but by reducing the informal sector
 baharhaal, bhavishya kaa rasta spasht nahin he
 It is very likely that the formal sector will not be able to take advantage of the artificial power gained from demonetisation and informal sector will start growing again

 One way to measure Nilkanth mix is to find out what percentage of GDP was in currency and how much it has fallen

 Other reasons may be those you have asked for: increase in digital payments and decrease in black money
 in donon maapdandon par notebandi ke prabhaav ko akele jimmedaar nahin mana ja saktaa haih digital bhugtan badha he, lekin iske kai duusare kaaran bhi ho sakate hai (jaise smart phone or internet kaa vistaar, bhugtan sevaayen dene vaale vaali companiyon kii ore se die jane vaale laabh, upiai ke liye dabaav)
 It is probably not possible to find out how much the impact of demonetisation has been
 isi tarah is saal janvari ke maheene main hi, jab abhi nai karency puri tarah chap bhi nahin pai thi, nai karency ke jakhiron kaa pakadaa janaa yah dikhaata he ki kaale dhan kaa khaatmaa nahin kiya ja sakaa tha
 The amount of black money (crime and bribe is also a reason for this) due to tax evasion, now may not be in such large quantity due to Goods and Services Tax (GST)
 jiesti ke chalate kar chori main kami aa sakati he or sarkaar kaa rajasav badha dikh saktaa he

 There was a spurt in digital payments after Dharmakirti Joshinotbandi, but it has come down after the new currency has fully entered the market

 How will demonetisation be analyzed by analyzing profit over cost? Much will depend on how efficiently the income tax department uses the data on money deposited in banks after demonetisation

 i agree that demonetisation is to end the trend of large denomination notes over a period of 12 months
 parinaam, nishchit rup se bahut zyada pareshaani
 The costs that are obvious are printing of notes, replacing new notes with new ones, reduction in GDP of two or three quarters
 vruddhi main ek pratishat kii giravat kaa matlab he rashtriya aay main 1

 In addition, there may be an upward trend in spending, especially for msmes due to the small scale
 is prakaar badlaav kaa yah samay agle do maheene tak jari rah saktaa he
 Looking at its positive aspect, the efficiency in logistics (reduced arrival time of trucks) is seen
 alp avadhi main dekhen to jidipi kii giri hui vruddhi dar par isse koi fark nahin padegaa yaa phir bahut maamuli rup se nakaaratmak prabhaav padegaa
 Ashok gulatigst has also been disastrous for a short time
 lekin jiesti puri tarah patari par aane ke baad rajyon ke bich aane-jane vaali baadhaaen dur ho jaaengi or kisaanon va unke upaj kaa prasanskaran karne waalon ke bich sidhaa sampark ban jayega
 Ajit Ranade It may take a year or so now

 GST is a welcome step to expand the base of Rohini somanathantax

 Taimur, who is enjoying B'day cake, is doing a lot in Pataudi, Mastirujuta, Kareena has also been a nutritionist
 unhone community farming kii pehle ke tahat yah tohfa taimur ko diya he
 Rujuta has written in her Insta post that this forest is spread over an area of 1000 square feet
 yahaan 3 jamun ke ped, ek katahal kaa ped, ek aanwale kaa ped, 40 kele kaa ped, 14 sahjan kaa ped, ek kocum, ek papeeta, 5 sharifa, 2 parasimon or do neembu ke ped hai
 a little forest for Taimur a little boy can never have enough of birds, bees and butterflies and so we have put together a small forest as a birthday gift for the little big boy, Taimur, in Sonave
 It‚Äôs a special forest, one that thrives on intercropping and i hope that as he grows he too will thrive in and celebrate a diverse society
 a society where people live together and due to their distinctions
 The forest has about 100 trees on a 1000 sq ft plot
 The trees are as young as Taimur, even younger actually, and each one of them is a local, native, climate resilient specie
 It will be a forest of the super foods of the future
 There are 3 jamuns, 1 jackfruit, 1 amla, 40 Bananas, 14 Moringas, 1 Kokum, 1 Papaya, 5 Seetaphal, 2 Ramphals, 2 Nimbu trees
 Besides these it grows 3 different types of native pulses and many Mirchi, Ginger, Turmeric and kari patta plants
 Not to mention the green leafy veggies and the genda phools that grow in between
 The forest is inspired by Padma Shri Subhash Palekar‚Äôs zero budget natural farming where one tree grows symbiotically off another and thus is thrifty on one‚Äôs pocket
 The forest will become a home for pollinating agents like the butterflies, bees, birds and earthworms
 It will help nurture the soil, fix back the nitrogen and minerals in the soil that it grows on, preserve the water table and look elegant and beautiful while doing it all
 Here's to living sustainably! Happy Birthday

 vah twit jisamen vah apane ek foloar se puche rahe hai ki naashtaa kiya yaa nahin??

 co / ca25hetsnp Bombay Velvet is released this Friday, produced by Anurag Kashyap and starcast, apart from Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, Karan Johar, Satyadeep Mishra, KK Menon, Manish Chaudhary, Siddharth Basu, Vivaan Shah and you as a singer in the film Raveena Tandon will also be seen
 'bombai velvet' kii kahani mumbai ke nirmaan par aadhaarit he, or isamen dikhaaya gaya he kaise saat dwipon ko jodakar mumbai bani or ise banane main kitna bhrashtachar hua
 Balraj i

 Ranbir, Khambata i

 Karan Johar, Rosie i
e
 Anushka Sharma and Chimman i
e
 Satyadeep Mishra are different characters of the same story
 ab baat karte hai film kii khaamiyon or khoobiyon kii, so, pehle khamiyaan
 
 
 The theme of the story is new and good, but it does not come on the screen reliably
 kahani bhatakati hui dikhti he
 In reaching the climax of emotions, some scenes from the characters are interrupted
 kahani bayaan karne kaa andaaz dhilaa he
 The screenplay is scattered
 kai hisson main film ubaau he - masalan, ranbir-anoushka kaa romantic trek
 In some scenes, there is also a lack of logic in some scenes, such as the color photographs taken in the 1969 Black and White era
 kahani main kai mode aap hazam nahin kar paaenge, masalan - paise aane ke baavjood ranbir kaa fite na chhodana
 The filmmaker may have felt it necessary for his character, but on screen it could not do anything other than increase the length of the film
 'bombai velvet' desh ke bantwaare ke do saal baad shuru hoti he
 Of course, there will be a struggle to show a few real photos of that era, but in the film it is not mixed with the new scenes
 masalan karan johar kii rescorse main maujuudagi kii nai tasviren, horse racing kii puraani tasveeron se bilkul mail nahin khaatin
 So even in editing, this mistake of the film stings
 saath hi agar aapaki khwaahish purana bombai dekhne kii he, to shaayad usamen bhi aapako safalataa nahin milegi, kyonki aise seens film main bahut kam hai
 Now talk of merits 
 
 '60 ke dashak ke raag film ke gaanon ko zindaa karte hai, so, gane aapako pasand aa sakate hai
 But there is also a drawback here, they are so used in the film that after a while they start losing their influence
 tippaniyan Talking about acting, i liked the work of Satyadeep, KK Menon, Vivaan among all the actors
 film kaa becoground score acha he
 Raveena appears in only one place in the film, singing the song
 unka yah zaraa-sa role or chehre ke bhav vaaki asardaar hai
 Seeing Raveena reminds the live stage performance of singers like Usha Uthup
 meri ore se 'bombai velvet' kii reating he - 2 star
 
 
 The story of 'bombay Velvet' is based on the construction of Mumbai, and it shows how Mumbai was formed by connecting seven islands and how much corruption went into making it
 isi kisse ke alag-alag kirdaar hai balraj yani ranbir, khambata yani karan johar, rozi yani anoushka sharma or chimman yani satyadeep mishra
 Now let's talk about the shortcomings and strengths of the film, so first the shortcomings
 
 
 kahani kaa vishay nayaa or acha to he, lekin vah majbooti se parde par nahin aata
 The story looks wandering
 bhaawanaaon ke charam par pahunchane main, kirdaaron ke kuch seens baadha daalate hai
 The style of narrating the story is loose
 screenple bikharaa hua he
 The film is boring in many parts - for example, ranbir-anushka's romantic track
 kai jagah kuch seens main tark kii bhi kami dikhti he, jaise - 1969 ke blike and white daur main rangeen photo kaa khinchaa janaa
 You will not be able to digest many twists in the story, for example - Ranbir does not give up his fight despite getting the money
 shaayad yah filmkaar ko unke kirdaar ke liye zaruri laga ho, lekin parde par yah film kii lambaai badhaane ke alaava kuch nahin kar paata
 'bombay Velvet' begins two years after the Partition of the country
 zaahir he, us daur kii chand asal tasviren dikhaane kii jaddozahad hogi, lekin film main ise nae seens ke saath milaayaa nahin gaya
 For example, the new pictures of Karan Johar's presence in the race course do not exactly match the old pictures of horse racing
 to editing main bhi film kii yah bhul chubhti he
 Also, if you wish to see old Bombay, you probably will not get success in that too, because such scenes are very few in the film
 ab baat khoobiyon kii
 
 
 The '60s raga lives up to the film's songs, so you may like the songs
 lekin yahaan bhi ek khami he, film main inkaa itnaa istemaal hua he ki ek vakt ke baad ye apana asar khone lagate hai
 The comments abhinay kii baat karen to sabhi kalakaaron main mujhe satyadeep, keke menon, vivaan kaa kaam acha laga
 The background score of the film is good
 ravina sirf ek jagah film main nazar aati hai, gaanaa gaate hue
 His slight role and facial expressions are really effective
 ravina ko dekhakar ushaa utthup jaisi gayikaon kaa live stage parformens yaad aata he
 i have a rating of 'bombay Velvet' - 2 stars

 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon kii tarah loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi rashtriya janatantric (rajg) gathbandhan main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) or janata dal-united (jadyu) ke bich chunavi talmail banate najar nahin aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, JDU will contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections alone in Uttar Pradesh
 philhal jadyu ne 60 siton par pratyaashee utaarne kaa faisla kiya he
 According to JDU state president Suresh Niranjan Bhaiya, it has come to the fore that Lok Sabha elections may be held before time
 aise main jadyu ne bhi uttar pradesh kii vibhinn siton par loksabhaa pratyaashee utarane ke liye manthan shuru kar diya he
 The party is trying to contest this election under the NDA
 iske liye uttar pradesh main jadyu ko bhaajapa ke saath saajha pratyaashee utaarna he
 But bjp's stance is not looking positive in this direction
 uttar pradesh main vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi bhaajapa kaa yahi rukh rahaa

 aise main jadyu bhaajapa ke rukh ko dekhakar loksabhaa chunaavon ko bhi apane dam par ladane kii taiyaariyon main jute gai he
 For this, the party has decided to field candidates for sixty seats at present, including eastern and western Uttar Pradesh

 magar pichley vis chunaav main jab party gathbandhan se hatakar apane dam par akele chunaav ladi to zyada se zyada siton par use pratyaashee utaarne kaa mauka mila tha
 Now this is what JDU wants in Lok Sabha elections
 " If contested under the NDA alliance in the last Lok Sabha elections, he got permission to field candidates in only two seats
 yah seat badaayun or salmepur thi
 The NDA coalition then included BJP, JDU as well as Rashtriya Lok Dal

 He said that the party's activities to fight the Lok Sabha elections alone have been intensified

 According to JDU state president Suresh Niranjan Bhaiya, it has come to the fore that Lok Sabha elections may be held before time
 aise main jadyu ne bhi uttar pradesh kii vibhinn siton par loksabhaa pratyaashee utarane ke liye manthan shuru kar diya he
 The party is trying to contest this election under the NDA
 iske liye uttar pradesh main jadyu ko bhaajapa ke saath saajha pratyaashee utaarna he
 But bjp's stance is not looking positive in this direction
 uttar pradesh main vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi bhaajapa kaa yahi rukh rahaa

 For this, JDU has to field a common candidate with the BJP in Uttar Pradesh
 magar bhaajapa kaa rukh is disha main sakaaratmak nahin dikh rahaa he
 The BJP held the same position in the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh
 majaboor hokar party ke rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav ne rajg gathbandhan ke bajaay uttar pradesh main sidhe party ko is chunaav ko ladane ke nirdesh die the
 The party followed this and fought the Vis elections
 ab loksabhaa chunaav kareeb hai or bhaajapa is gathbandhan ko lekar jaraa bhi chintit najar nahin dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, JDU has started preparing to fight the Lok Sabha elections on its own, seeing the attitude of the BJP
 iske liye party ne purvi va pashchimi uttar pradesh ko milakar philhal saath siton par pratyaashee utaarne kaa nirnay kiya he
 The comments pradesh adhyaksh ne kaha, "rajg gathbandhan ke tahat party ko kam siton par hi santosh karnaa padataa he
 But in the last election, when the party broke away from the coalition and fought alone on its own, it had a chance to field candidates in more and more seats
 ab loksabhaa chunaav main jadyu yahi chahta he
 " pichley loksabhaa chunaavon main rajg gathbandhan ke tahat chunaav ladaa to use sirf do siten par hi pratyaashee utaarne kii anumati gathbandhan ke tahat mili
 This seat was Badaun and Salampur
 rajg gathbandhan main tab bhaajapa, jadyu ke saath hi rashtriya lokdal bhi shaamil tha
 This time in Lok Sabha elections, new faces can get a chance on these seats
 unhone bataaya ki loksabhaa chunaavon ko akele ladane ko lekar party kii gatividhiyaan tej kar di gai hai

 There is no mutual infighting in the Haryana Congress
 purv mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda or pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar kii aapasi tanatani aksar khulkar saamne aati rahi he
 In Rahul's programs too, the quarrel between the two has come to the fore
 phir chaahe wo bhoomi adhigrahan ke mudde par ramlila maidan main hui raily ho yaa phir rahul kii devaria se dilli kii kisaan yatra kaa samaapan
 At the conclusion of the yatra, there was a scuffle between Ashok Tanwar and Hooda supporters
 is baar 29 april ko hone vaali ramlila maidan kii raily main aisa koi tamaasha naa ho
 Therefore, the Congress high command has instructed all the leaders of Haryana Congress not to try to show strength separately
 gauratlab he ki hooda samarthak pichhali reliyon main gulabi rang kii pagadi baandhakar aate rahe hai or kai maukon par ashok tanvar kii hooting karte rahe hai
 This scene has also happened in front of Rahul
 isliye alaakaman ne is baar pehle se hi gulabi pagadi par roak laga di he
 But the important thing is that Rajasthan and Haryana adjacent to Delhi have an important role to gather the crowd in the rally
 khaskar hooda kii bhoomika bheed jutaney main khaasi ahm maani jaati rahi he
 But after stepping down from the post of CM, Hooda has been performing his power with the help of pink turban
 isamen kai baar samarthak hangaamaa karke maahaul kharaab karte rahe hai
 So this time Hooda himself has also asked his supporters not to wear pink turbans
 is baavat saansad deepender hooda ne kaha kiis baar hamaresamarthak gulabi pagadi main nahin aaenge
 But there will be so much that the throne of Modi government will be shaken
 congress ne gulabi pagadi ke jariye takat dikhaane se to parhez karne ko kah diya he
 But Hooda has also been given the responsibility so that the crowd is not reduced
 hooda ne bhi apanedillisthit awaas main raily main bheed jutaney ke liye apane samarthakon kii baithak bulaai he
 14 mlas, 100 former mlas and all the leaders attended the meeting
 google play store main kuch aise bhi eps hai jo aapako nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Recently we told you that Google has removed some dangerous apps from the Play Store
 sibar security form Dr Web ke mutabik 33 aise eps hai jo khatarnaak hai or logon ko inase bachanaa chahie
 That is, avoid installing it

 It is also named as Ixigo Trains which has been installed 50 million times
 bharat main khaas kar yah ap sabase zyada yuj kiya jaataa he
 Apart from this, apps like GPS, QR Code Reader, Navigation Apps and Muslim Prayer Time are also affected by bugs and can harm you
 Dr Web ke mutabaki ye 33 eps Android Click 312 origin se prabhavit hai jo ek tarah kaa Trojan he
 With this, any of the 33 apps you install on your smartphone, starts working after 8 hours
 ye ap galat kaan nahin karata, yani aap jis makasad se ise downlod karte hai wo puraa karata he, lekin becoground main ye aapaki jaankariyaan chori karata he or isse aapkaa bada nuksaan ho saktaa he

 It also works to collect your personal data
 gauratlab he ki google ne Dr Web kii is report ke baad kai eps play store se jarur hataa liye hai
 But if your smartphone still has one or many of these apps, then removing it will be a profitable deal for you

 Our time is being recorded daily in some part of the world that the work of religion is not as much as it is to create spiritual peace, more than it is to spread hatred, to create joy, and to create such a group of powerful people in organized form
 Gone are those who come to decide our life from anywhere
 aatankwaad kaa koi mulk yaa majahab hota to pakistan kii is ghatana se bharat ke log dehshat main nahin aate
 There have been terrorist attacks in Pakistan before also, but this was an attack that people watching on TV started getting worried about the security around them
 peshawar pakistan ke kaibar pakhtoonkhwaah praant main padataa he, jise north west frontier provins ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The lives of these children escaped from the Army Public School here, but they would have lost their lives
 ye bachche dehshat ke jane kitne kaufanaak kisson ke saath aaj ghar laute honge
 Holding each other's hands with an older student, these little children must have held each other's hands so strongly
 kahin koi bujurg bachche ko peeth par lad kar bhaag rahe the to kahin koi jawan apni ek hi bike par sabko bitha lenaa chahta tha
 So that all these can be saved
 ab tak 140 kii maut kii khabar he jinamein 134 bachche hai
 There are more than hundred injured, many of them are also serious
 is taliban ko jitna dharm ne janm nahin diya usase kahin zyada mulkon kii siyaasi jodtod ke khel ne
 Today, the identity of the Taliban has lost the impression of all the countries that have coined it
 lekin taliban jane kis islam ko dho rahaa he jisaki kitaab padhane vaale kehete-kehete thak gaye ki ye na to jihad he or na islam he
 Many countries gained strength but the Taliban did not disappear
 dopaher ke vakt skool main bacchon kii sankhya 800 se 1500 ke bich bataai gai
 Some were playing basketball and many children were in the First Aid program in the auditorium
 kuch kamaron main imtahaan chal rahaa tha
 The school went on as it went

 Two nephews of ARY news channel reporter reporting from the spot have also fallen victim to this attack
 vah report karte-karte bharbhara gayi
 Every detail of this incident creates disgust
 talibaniyon ne bacchon ke sir par yah puch kar goli maari ki kiske pita sena main kaam karte hai
 On Monday, the world was recovering from the Sydney incident that Tuesday's incident scared people in the part of India
 hamane usee pakistan se aane vaali dehshat ke aise kai manzar dekhe hai
 We have been reporting the news of terrorist attack in Pakistan in our footnote, but the incident of Army Public School in Peshawar has scared people in India too
 aaj daftar aate-aate kai mata pitaaon ke phone aane lage ki hamaare shahar ke skulon kii kya suraksha he
 The Mumbai Police even started taking stock of the schools in their area
 thane ko alert kar diya ki ilaake ke skulon par nazar rakhen
 a Pakistani father rightly said that we spend twenty-twenty years raising a child, but the killer did not even spend twenty minutes
 uski ye baat is paar bhi mumbai hamalon se lekar tamaam un hamalon ke sakshi logon ke bich gunj rahi thi
 The people there are also talking like here that Nawaz Sharif walks in a convoy of armored vehicles, but our children are not safe
 skool main chah talibani ghuse the
 It must have been around twelve o'clock in the afternoon when he entered the school while firing
 500 se zyaada bacchon or staff ko bandhak bana liya
 Due to the area of the army, the army blocked the area, but could not save the lives of the children
 is ghatana kii jimmedaari lene vaale taharike taliban ne kaha ki pakistan kii sena unke khilaaf karrwai kar rahi he
 His family is killing them, so we have also attacked his family
 pakistan kii sena pichley chah maheene se uttari wajiristaan main talibaniyon ke khilaaf oparation chalaa rahi he
 The name of this operation is zarb-e-azb
 is oparation main abhi tak 1800 se zyada talibani or unke samarthakon ke maare jane kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 There is a precedent that Pakistan is fighting terrorism
 pakistan ne teen din ke rashtriya shok kaa elaan kiya he
 Six terrorists involved in this attack were killed, but they had come to die
 sava sau bacchon kii maut se pakistan vaise hi bilakh rahaa he, jaise aise hamalon ke vakt ham kampa karte the
 There too, ordinary people have been killed in terrorist attacks
 unki bebasii hamaari bebasii se milti julati he
 The slogan of leaders around the world fighting terrorism together seems hollow again today
 jin netaaon ke purvajon kii karatuut se aatankwaad panpa he vah internet or har din nai tarah ke commando force bana dene ke baad bhi aatankwaad ko nahin mitaa paa rahe hai
 Today the tremor of Pakistan can be seen on the face of Kanwal Noman, MLA of Punjab Assembly of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz
 jo kahati he, ''main ye samajhati hum ki dehshatgard jo hai unka koi deen imaan nahin he
 
 
 They do not believe in any God
 
 
 kisi in kanoon ko nahin maanate
 
 
 He was not ashamed of what the fault of these innocent children was
 
 Those terrorists will also be fathers and will be someone's son
 
 
 unke bacchon ko bhi is tarah maar diya jaae to kya guzaregi unke dil pe
 
 
 They destroyed 130 houses
 
 
 aap yakeen maane
 
 
 i did not want to come on session today
 
 
 ab main dil chaah rahaa he vahaan jaaun or un maa-baap ke saath chikhen maar-maar kar roun
 
 
 i say that no, it is too much to not kill these criminals so punish them so painfully
 
 
 inako pakadakar itani dardanaak sazaa den ki dobaaraa kisi maa kii god ye naa ujaaden
 
 
 Never martyr a child
 
 
 main bhi maa hum
 
 
 Those mothers knew that their children are going to school today and they will not see their face again
 
 
 itnaa zulm
 
 
 So much with those children
 
 
 un maasoom bacchon ne kya gunaah kiya tha
 
 
 What was their fault 
 
 dehshatgard ye kyon nahin sochate
 
 
 That they too have to appear in court
 
 
 kitni mannaton se ham maa baap bacchon ko maangate hai allaah miyaan se
 
 
 Children are the support of life
 
 
 meraa baccha biimaar ho jaae to main kahati hum ki mere bachche ko kuch naa ho allaah miyaan isaki takaleef mujhe de de
 
 
 My child does not have any problem
 
 
 un maanon pe kya guzar rahi hogi
 
 
 What will pass on those who will see their children in this condition? 
 
 '' This panic has also knocked in India
 kisi dharm main aatankwaad kii koi jagah nahin he yah naaraa ghis chukaa he
 If there is no place of terrorism in religion and humanity, then why is terrorism everywhere
 aakhir dharm kuch to takat detaa hoga jiske naam par sanghathan banaakar yahaan se lekar vahaan tak log hinsa kii bhashaa bolne lagate hai
 With the language of religious parochialism, we are meeting every day in India
 pakistan to isi kaa guna bhaag karata rahaa he, lekin ab use bhi ladanaa pad rahaa he
 On December 4, Pakistan had given two trains for the Lahore rally of terrorist Hafiz Saeed, accused of Mumbai attack
 jamaat ud daawa par antarrashtriya pratibandh he iske baad bhi pakistan ne karachi, hyderabad or sindh praant se haafiz said samarthakon ko lahore laane ke liye madad kii
 Even Imran Khan's party had canceled its party's program in support of Hafiz Saeed's rally
 aise narsanhaar kisi bhi mazahab se vishwaas uthaa dene ke liye kaaphi he lekin ham kahaan maanate hai
 After the condemnation, we again choose our own courtesans and start patronizing the terrorist obsession
 mohabbat kii baat karne vaale haashiye par chale jate hai, nafrat kii baat karne waalon ko kahin bandook mil jaati he to kahin satta
 It is also for the people of Pakistan to understand that one day one has to stand against the nexus between the power army and terror
 tivi par pakistan se ek awaz aa rahi thi jo aisi hi baat kar rahi thi ki aatankwaadi hi nahin hamaare haath un siyaasi dalon ke girebaan tak jane hi chahie jo in aatankwaadi sanghathanon kaa paksh lete hai
 a few days ago, even 15-year-old child Etazaz Hasan lost his life fighting terrorism in his own way
 isi saal janvari main peshawar ke qareeb hangu main hasan ne skool ke andar jaakar aatmghaatee hamalvar ke bade nuksaan pahunchane ke mansoobey ko naakaam kar diya
 According to reports, Hassan was going to school that day, while on the way, a young man wearing a school uniform asked him the address of the government school
 
 
 hasan ko ye jaanane main der nahin lagi ki ye hamalavar he or baaki bacchon ko bachaane ke liye usne khud kii jaan ko daanv par laga diya
 
 
 Her friends from school have left the chair empty for Hassan in class
 aaj aisi hi anek kursiyaan khaali ho gai hai
 At the time when many people were trapped in a cafe in Sydney, many people in the city were worrying that Muslim cities would not be treated badly
 bas vahaan ke log twit karne lage ki ham aapke saath hai
 You will leave in your dress, we will come with you in a taxi
 shaayad usee kaa asar tha ki aaj bharat main bhi twit hone laga ki bharat pakistan ke saath he
 This is a good start
 mulk or majahab se paar jaakar ek duusare kaa haath thamkar aatankwaad se ladane kii

 bijepi se nilambit saansad kirti aaazaad kii patni or dilli bijepi kii pravaktaa punam aaazaad ke aam aadmi party main jane kii atakalein tej hai
 When NDTV India spoke to Poonam, she did not rule out this possibility
 bas itnaa kaha ki ho saktaa he ki agle ek-do din main iskaa elaan ho jaae
 At the same time, Kirti said that Poonam talks about women empowerment, what is wrong if she serves women by going to Aam Aadmi Party? kya party se aap or aapaki patni naaraaz hai, is par kirti ne kaha ki maine kuch galat nahin kaha he, bas ek bhrasht ko bhrasht kaha he
 Today i am not allowed to ask questions in Parliament

 On being asked if he (kirti) can also go to the Aam Aadmi Party, Kirti said that i have been suspended (BJP) for the moment, i will think if the party removes
 tippaniyan Kirti said that people of Bihar especially Mithilanchal can not only influence the results of 20 seats in Punjab, but they also said in gestures that if Poonam Azad resigned from BJP and joined AAP, then this Delhi BJP Will prove to be a big shock to dilli main 20 lakh se adhik purvanchalavasi hai, aise main purvanchal ke matadaata prabhavit ho sakate hai
 However, NDTV India has received information from sources that Navjot Singh Sidhu in Punjab and Poonam Azad in Delhi can hold 'AAP' on the same day
 pichley dinon punam aaazaad ne kaha tha ki unke parivaar ke saath party anyaay kar rahi he, kirti kaa party se nilamban sahi nahin he
 Poonam had said that Kirti had not acted against the policy and principles of the party and has been active for the last 25 years as a dedicated worker of the party

 kirti ne kaha ki bihar visheshkar mithilanchal ke log na keval punjab main 20 siton ke nateezon ko prabhavit kar sakate hai, balki unhone ishaaron main ye bhi kaha ki yadi punam aaazaad ne bijepi se istipha dekar 'aap' kaa daaman thama, to yah dilli bijepi ke liye bada jhatka sabit hoga
 There are more than 20 lakh Purvanchal residents in Delhi, so the voters of Purvanchal may be affected
 vaise enditivi india ko sutron se jaankaree mili he ki agle kuch din main punjab main navjot singh siddhu or dilli main punam aaazaad ek hi din 'aap' kaa daaman tham sakate hai
 Recently Poonam Azad had said that the party is doing injustice to his family, suspension of Kirti from the party is not right
 punam ne kaha tha ki kirti ne party kii niti or siddhant ke khilaaf koi kaary nahin kiya tha or vah party ke samarpit kaaryakarta ke taur par pichley 25 saal se sakriy hai

 There are reports of sending invitation to Rahul Gandhi in the program to be held from September 17 to 19 next month
 in khabaron ke bich ab congress netamallikarjun khadgene rahul gandhi se kaha he ki aresas ekajaharhai, ye sab jaanate hai
 If you know that there is poison in front then there is no need to taste it, because everyone knows the result of tasting poison
 khadge ne kaha ki aresas apni vichaardhaara ko failaana chahta he, usamen ham bhagidaar kyon bane
 After all, it is an ideology that divides and follows Manu Smriti instead of the Constitution
 khadge ne kaha ki rahul gandhi yaa party ke kisi anya netaa ke aresas kaarykram main bhaag lene kaa koi sawaal hi nahin uthta he
 RSS is going to conduct 'future of India' program next month
 isamen congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko bhi aamantrit karne kii khabaren hai
 On the RSS invitation to Rahul, Kharge said that the Congress is engaged in an ideological battle with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the party also left the post of Chief Minister in Karnataka to keep the BJP away from power
 khadge ne kaha ki karnataka main ek choti kshetreey party (janata dal-secular) ke 37 vidhayak hai or hamaare 80 vidhayak hai
 But we left the Chief Minister's post for that party to strengthen the secular forces
 isliye (gandhi yaa congress ke kisi anya netaa ke) aresas mukhyalay jane kaa koi sawaal hi nahin uthta
 He termed RSS ideology as poison for the country and for Dalits and other oppressed classes

 The Supreme Court ordered the prosecution of 13 others, including senior BJP leader LK Advani, in the case of the demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya 25 years ago
 rashtriya janata dal supremeo lalu prasad ne adwani ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaae jane par kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi adwani ke khilaaf raajnneetik sajeesh rachi he taaki wo raashtrapati kii res se baahar ho jaae
 What Lalgurat said on Advani is that the term of President Pranab Mukherjee is going to be completed in the month of July this year and LK Advani's name is also a matter of discussion regarding the new President
 lalu ne kaha kiadwani ko raashtrapati kii res se baharnikaalane ke liye hi pradhanmantri modi ne unke khilaaf babari masjid vidhwans maamle main mukadmaa chalaane kii sajeesh rachi
 Lalu alleged that the CBI, which is under the central government, deliberately presented evidence against Advani in the Supreme Court to initiate a case against him

 By cutting the pockets of the common man, the government is filling its coffers by increasing taxes on petrol and diesel
 6 taarikh ko petrol par 1 rupee 60 paise to dijal par 40 paise prati litre kii exise dauty badha di gai he, jisase petrol dijal ke daam phir chadh gaye hai
 The comments iske sidhe myne ye bhi hai ki desh main petrol par lagane vaale tex or duty tel kii laagat se zyada ho gai hai
 This has happened due to increase in excise duty on petrol five times in a year
 isse dilli main petrol kii keemat 60 rupee 70 paise prati litre ho gai he, jisamen 31 rupee 20 paise tex or exise duty ke hai
 The price of diesel is 45 rupees 93 paise per liter, including 17
 45 rupee tex or excise duty ke hai
 This year, the excise duty on petrol has been increased by 9 rupees 35 paise and on diesel by 6 rupees 90 paise
 exise duty badaye jane ke kaaran antarrashtriya bazaar main kaccha tel sasta hone kaa phayda aam logon ko nahin mil rahaa he
 It also directly means that taxes and duties on petrol in the country have exceeded the cost of oil
 petrol par ek saal main paanch baar exise duty badhaane ke kaaran aisa hua he
 With this, the price of petrol in Delhi has been increased to 60 rupees 70 paise per liter, of which 31 rupees 20 paise is for tax and excise duty
 dijal kii keemat 45 rupee 93 paise prati litre he, jisamen 17
 45 rupees is for tax and excise duty
 is saal petrol par excise duty 9 rupee 35 paise or dijal par 6 rupee 90 paise badhaai gai he
 Due to increase in excise duty, common people are not getting the benefit of cheap crude oil in the international market
 dijal kii keemat 45 rupee 93 paise prati litre he, jisamen 17

 Jharkhand Vikas morcha-prajatantrik (JVM-P), headed by former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi, has decided to contest the election alone
 vah rajya kii sabhi 81 siton par chunaav ladega
 Marandi said on 3 November that he had to take this decision due to the coalition being offered 'insufficient seats' by the JVP-M
 congress, jharkhand mukti morcha (jeemem), rashtriya janata dal (argedy) or jeviem-pi ne loksabhaa chunaav se pehle aapas main gathbandhan karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi, lekin bhaajapa ke netritv vaale endie ne rajya kii 14 loksabhaa siton main se 12 siten jeet lee thim

 india today dwaara sawaal kiye jane par in adhikariyon ne banda jile main bahane vaali ken nadi ke bare main yah jaankaree di
 The irony is that the river on which the authorities deny illegal mining and its stream is stopped, just two kilometers away from the government offices of these officials under Sadar Tehsil in Banda district, the mining mafia has called The river is held hostage
 madhya pradesh ke jabalpur jile se nikalne vaali ken nadi kii aviral dhara 400 kimi kii duuri tay kar uttar pradesh ke banda jile main pahunchati hai, yahaan ke khanan mafia ne sarkaar kii naak ke neeche hi is par kabja jamaa liya
 The river stream was nearly closed by pouring thousands of sand sacks on Hardauli Ghat under Sadar tehsil
 nadi ke bichobich avaidh rasta banaaya gaya taaki mafia ke baaluu or maurang (moti ret) se laden trek afasaron kii najaron se bachate hue shahar se baahar ja saken
 The questions that have arisen over the misdeeds of officers and mining mafia in Bundelkhand region have deepened in Banda
 hardauli ghat, jahaan nadi kii dhara ko roka gaya he, vahaan se 100 meter dakshin main ken par sethu nigam ek pul kaa nirmaan kar rahaa he or adhikari har duusare din iskaa nirikshan karne aa rahe hai
 But they too did not see this illegal dam operating for the last three months
 afasar ankhen munde hue hai or sthaneey intelegence unit ke bhi kaan band hai
 As a result, the mining mafia has become so fearless that Ken's chest has started sieving in the city itself
 hardauli ghat se 3 kilometre kii duuri par nadi ke kinare rajghat ilaake main to khanan mafia ne na keval baandh banaakar nadi kii dhara ko roak diya he, balki yahaan par baari bharkam baaluu liftor mashiinon se nadi kaa seenaa chirakar baaluu or maurang kaa avaidh khanan kiya ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, Kanwara, Patharia of Kotwali town area of the city, Chharawa, Girwan of Kotwali countryside, Udaipur village of Bhadosa station area in Atra tehsil, Parsinghpur and Kulsari of Fatehganj are the main areas where illegal mining of sand and maurang is in full swing
 yahaan se roj 3,000 se zyada trek baaluu or maurang ladakar use banda ke najdiki jilon kanpur, fatehpur or raibareli pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 Brajmohan Yadav, who lives on the banks of Hardauli Ghat, says that since the first week of October, a sudden dam was built along the banks of Cane and its stream was stopped
 phir teen din ke bheetar is baandh se hota hua ek or rasta banaaya gaya taaki baaluu or maurang se laden trek berokatoke shahar se baahar nikal saken
 However, only mafia trucks are allowed to pass through this illegal dam
 aam aadmi iske najadik nahin aa sake, iske liye baqayada maarg ke donon ore contili jhaadibhan lagaai gai hai
 Mining mafia henchmen go on a rampage when they go out on this path by mistake
 bharat ke niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak kii report ke mutabik, bundelkhand ke 13 jilon main har varsh kareeb 400 karod ru
 Illegal mining is taking place
 in ilaakon main sarvaadhik khanan baaluu, maurang, pathar or mitti kaa hota he
 There are 26 registered registered mines in Banda
 supreme court ne 27 farvari, 2012 ko or baad main elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ne 1 aktubar, 2012 ko apane aadesh main aisi sabhi khanan gatividhiyon par roak lagane ke nirdesh die the, jinke paas paryaavaran vibhaag kaa sahmati praaanpatr nahin he
 To know the effect of this order, RTI activist Ashish Sagar Dixit of Banda sought information from the administration about the people eligible for mining and the standards of mining under the Right to Information Act
 jila khanij karyaalay se ashish ko 29 november ko jo soochna di gai, uske mutabik puure jile main keval ek hi vyakti ke paas khanan ke liye paryaavaran vibhaag kaa anaapatti praaanpatr he or uskaa khanan kaa patta banda jile kii atarra tehsil main aata he
 Ashish says, "it is clear from the information received from the administration that wherever sand and maurang are being mined on the banks of Cane in Sadar tehsil, it is illegal
" itnaa hi nahin, ken banda main pani kaa ekmaatr prakritik strot he
 It is a cognizable offense to build a dam and stop its flow
 ‚Äô‚Äô jile main khanan ke liye bhale hi ek vyakti paatr ho, lekin do darjan se adhik log avaidh rup se khanan main lage hue hai jinhen kisi bhi niyam- kanoon kii parvaah nahin he
 Due to this, the administration has received Rs 10 crore so far this financial year
 se zyada kii rajasav kshati uthaani padi he
 Due to illegal mining by machines along the banks of Rajghat at Cane, the natural stream of the river has been divided into several parts
 jo nadi banda jile main pravesh karne par 60 se 70 foot tak chaudee he, vah avaidh khanan ke chalate shahar ke bich aate-aate kai bhaagon main bant jaati he or kisi bhi bhaag kii chaudaai 10-15 foot se zyada nahin he
 Environmentalist Dr
 bhaaratendu prakaash kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòken nadi ke kinare baaluu or maurang ke avaidh khanan se do tarah kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 The first is the natural embankment of sand on the banks of the river, and the second is draining the river water rapidly due to the removal of more sand and maurang from the foothills
 iske chalate ken ke vilupt hone kii ashanka bad gai he
 "even though the river has not yet become extinct, but the effect of stopping the current and illegal mining by constructing a dam has started to appear
 avaidh baandh se kareeb 10 kimi kii duuri par bagichadera gaanv ke kinare aate-aate ken ne mahaj ek naale kaa rup dhaaran kar liya he
 Its stream has remained very thin here and the shocking thing is that due to the depth and flow, there were problems in crossing by boat, people are now crossing it on foot
 nishadon kii basti vaale bagichadera gaanv main logon kii kheti chaupat ho gai he
 Says Rambabu of the same village, "on the banks of Cane there was cultivation of linseed, pigeonpea, gram, wheat and seasonal vegetables
 lekin pichley teen maah se nadi main pani ke kaaphi kam hone se sinchai kaa sankat paidaa ho gaya he or is baar nadi ke kinare koi bhi fasal nahin boi gai he
 Nasimuddin Siddiqui, BSP national general secretary and resident of Banda, says, "I was born in Sherpur Seodha, a village on the banks of the river Ken
 jivan main pehali baar main is nadi ko itane badahaal rup main dekh rahaa hum
 Illegal mining has changed the form of the river itself
 iske liye mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav sidhe taur par jimmedaar hai
 One example of the deteriorating government functioning is also that the District Mineral Office has informed Ashish Sagar that there is no set of standards in relation to mining, while the Uttar Pradesh Government of Uttar Pradesh Sub Mineral Rules 2012, (revised) The issuance has prescribed the modalities of mining
 paanch prishthon vaali is niyamavali ke mutabik paryaavaran sangrakshan ke liye nadi kii prakritik dhara se chhedchhad nahin kii jaaegi or khanan main mashiinon kaa prayog kiye jane se yadi nadi kii prakritik dhara evam kinaaron ko koi kshati pahunchati he to pattadharak par kadi karrwai karne kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 But the administration has not yet identified a single person doing illegal mining on Kane
 banda ke sadar vidhansabha kshetra se congressi vidhayak vivek singh kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòkya yah sambhav he ki pichley teen maah se jile kii mukhya nadi kii dhara roak lee jaae, baaluu or maurang kaa avaidh khanan ho or sarkari agency ko isaki bhanak tak na lage
 "he says," a liquor businessman in the BSP government had directly captured mining in the Bundelkhand area and the same is happening in the present government
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke sangyaan main sari baaten hai
 This collusion is the reason why officers do not see illegal mining
 ‚Äô‚Äôyah khanan mafia, afasar or netaaon kii mileebhagat kaa hi kamaal tha ki ek ore jahaan avaidh khanan ne bundelkhand ilaake kii jameen ko chalni kar diya, vahiin yahaan ke netaa lagaataar amir hote gaye
 The district president of a party in Banda, who used to ride a motorcycle two years ago, now drives in expensive suvs
 netaaon or mafia ke gathjod kaa hi kamaal he ki afasar chaahakar bhi avaidh khanan rokane ke liye koi kadam nahin uthaa paa rahe hai
 If an honest officer tried to clamp down on these mafia, he was either transferred or attacked and tried to intimidate him
 isi varsh janvari main banda jila panchayat ke adhikari amrendra kumaar ne khanan mafia par haath daalaa to unki hatya kar di gai
 Uma Bharti, a senior BJP leader and MLA from Charkhari Assembly in Mahoba district, says, "leaders of all parties are patronizing illegal mining
" ken nadi ke swaroop ko bigaadpee ke virodh main jald hi deshvyapee andolan chhedaa jayega
 However, the manner in which the mining mafia has shown courage to stop illegal mining by blocking the stream of Cane River in the SP government, which has raised voice against illegal mining in the previous BSP government, is also raising questions on the functioning of the present government
 
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav, jo khanan vibhaag ke mantri bhi hai, bhi agar saream ho rahe is avaidh khanan par nakel na kas saken, to un par bhi ungliyaan uthanaa lajimi he
