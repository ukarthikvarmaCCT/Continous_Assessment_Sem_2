 lekin company ise aamantran se degi yani vah apane yujar khud chunegi
 The user has to pay 8 dollars
 iske liye company shuru main free trial bhi degi

 Lawyer Vishwanath Chaturvedi, who filed a disproportionate assets case against SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav and his family, has filed an application in the Supreme Court seeking direction to the CBI to file a regular case in the matter
 is par court jald sunwaayee karegaa
 The CBI had agreed that the case was made, but in its application, Chaturvedi said that in 2007, the Supreme Court had asked the CBI to investigate the allegations leveled by him
 sibiai ne praathmik jaanch main maamla banane kii baat bhi kahi thi, phir bhi niyamit cese darj nahin kiya
 The entire case against the Yadav family is against SP Mukhiyamoolayam Singh Yadav, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, Kannauj Lok Sabha MP Dimple Yadav and Mulayam's second son Prateek Yadav
 vishwanath chaturvedi ne apni yachika main kaha tha ki in sabhi kisampatti inaki aay se zyadahai
 The order which did not come due to the retirement of the judge has also attracted the attention of the Supreme Court that the court had reserved an order in 2009 on the cbi's frequently changing stand which has not come up till now
 chaturvedi ne apni is nai arji main kaha he kii chaar alag-alag argiyon par 10 farvari 2009 ko supreme court ne faisla surakshit rakh liya tha lekin faisla ab tak nahin sunaaya gaya he
 At that time, Syriac Joseph, a judge involved in the bench hearing the case, retired without passing judgment

 In such a situation, it should be investigated how he and his family acquired so much property
 mulaayam ne daayar kii thi punarvichaar yachikasupreme court ke 1 march 2007 ko aae sibiai jaanch ke faisle ke khilaaf mulaayam singh or unke parivaar ne punarvichaar yachika daali thi
 In the judgment of 2012, the Supreme Court refused to put a stay on the CBI investigation, but excluded Mulayam Singh's daughter-in-law Dimple Yadav from the scope of the investigation, saying that she was not in public office at that time

 ) zimbabwe daure par team india apana pehla match khel rahi he
 In this series, Team India is getting a chance to test the power of young players
 vanade maichon kii series shuru ho gai he or sabaki nazaren team india kii yuva brigade par he
 Karun Nair and Yajuvendra Chahal are making their ODI debut with this match
 pichley 4 saal main teesri baar team india zimbabwe daura kar rahi he
 The comments lekin yuva khilaadiyon ke liye ye daura kisi dodhari talwaar kii tarah sabit hota he
 Despite a good performance, it is not certain to be confirmed in the team, but poor performance may have to be criticized
 team agar zimbabwe kaa safaaya bhi kar detii he to bhi use sirf 1 hi ank milegaa or uski ranking par koi asar nahin padegaa
 It is a big opportunity for young players that they are getting the opportunity to represent Team India
 lekin wo khilaadi jo pehle bhi team india kaa hissaa rah chuke hai wo maanate hai ki vipakshi team koi bhi ho achche pradarshan kaa koi vikalp nahin he
 The biggest test is for captain MS Dhoni here
 unhone khud kaha he ki abhi unhone ritairement ke bare main nahin sochaa he
 But critics keep a close watch on Dhoni's every innings
 isliye har series ke baad unke bhavishya par charchaa hoti hi rahegi
 The special thing is that Mahi does not have as much experience as the entire team
 isliye dekhnaa dilachasp rahegaa ki zimbabwe kii kamazor chunauti ke saamne bharat ke yuva khilaadi haath main aaye mauqe kaa kitna phayda uthaate hai
 But for young players, this tour proves like a double-edged sword
 achche pradarshan ke baavjood team main jagah pakki hona tay nahin, lekin kharaab pradarshan par aalochana kaa shikaar hona pad saktaa he
 Even if the team sweeps Zimbabwe, they will get only 1 point and their ranking will not be affected
 yuva khilaadiyon ke liye ye zarur bada mauqaa he ki unhen team india kii numaaindgi kaa mauqaa mil rahaa he
 But those players who have been a part of Team India before also believe that no matter what the opposition team is, there is no option to perform well
 sabase bada imtihaan yahaan captain emes dhoni ke liye hi he
 He himself has said that he has not thought about retirement yet

 khaas baat ye he ki maahi ke paas jitna anubhav he utana anubhav puri team ke paas nahin he
 Therefore, it will be interesting to see how much India's young players take advantage of the opportunity in the face of a weak Zimbabwe challenge

 The selection panel, headed by Sandeep Patil, may include the young Karnataka batsman as the third opener after Murali Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan
 rahul ko anbhavi gautam gambhir kii jagah chunaa ja saktaa he jo england ke khilaaf aakhri do test main dhawan kii jagah khele, lekin chaar pariyon main 20 kaa score bhi paar nahin kar sake
 Rahul, however, will face a tough fight against Robin Uthappa of Karnataka, who scored a century against East Zone in the Duleep Trophy
 dravid kii chahat keel rahul or karn ko mili maukatim india ke purv captain or mistar bharosemand ke naam se mashhoor rahul dravid ne kaha he ki wo keel rahul ko australia daure ke liye railway ke pratibhavan leg spinner karn sharma ke saath test team main jagah banaate hue dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Dravid said, 'he scored more than 1000 runs in the domestic season and with two centuries in the Duleep Trophy final he looked in good form so if you want to give a chance to the young player then it is good to be picked at that time when he Is in good form and is playing really well
 aap shuruyaat main use vaikalpik salaami ballebaaj ke rup main chun sakate hai
 Dravid wants Karn to be favored over Ravindra Jadeja in the Test team as the wrist spinner is more likely to succeed in Australia, especially when he throws a fast ball in the air and has a good googly
 do wicketiper ho sakate hai team main shamilaselectors duusare wicketiper par bhi vichaar karenge
 In this, the competition will be between Wriddhiman Saha and Naman Ojha
 ojha ne uttar kshetra ke khilaaf dilip trophy match main doharaa shatak jamaaya lekin final main naakaam rahe
 On the other hand, Saha is taking wicketkeeping in place of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the ODI series against Sri Lanka, so he may get preference
 shami, aaron kii injuri ne badhaai mushkilen
 
 
 Injuries to fast bowlers Mohammed Shami and Varun Aaron have added to the problems

 The Indian team will leave for Australia on 21 November
 eshanth sharma or bhubaneshwar kumaar tej akraman kii aguwai karenge jabaki stuart binni olerounder ke rup main team main jagah bana sakate hai
 Binny took seven wickets in the Duleep Trophy match against East
 tej gendbaaji main umesh yadav bhi ek vikalp hai, lekin rajasthan ke pankaj singh apekshaaon par khare nahin utar sake
 Ishwar Pandey was not used in England
 shami or aaron ke nahin khilne par singh ko tarjeeh di ja sakati he
 Karan Sharma may get as a spinner, in addition to r Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in Moussapin, Karn Sharma of Uttar Pradesh may get a chance
 basharte selectors anbhavi amit mishra yaa piyush chawla ko nahin chunane kaa man banaaen
 In batting, in the middle order, Rohit Sharma in the practice match against Sri Lanka has expressed that he has recovered from a finger injury
 cheteshwar pujaara, viraat kohli, ajinkya rahane, rohit or captain dhoni middle order ko majboot karenge
 Team India will play the first Test in Brisbane from 04 December, while the remaining matches will be played in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney

 The BJP won an absolute majority in UP and Uttarakhand, while the Congress emerged as the single largest party in Manipur and Goa
 punjab main congress ne sarkaar banaai, lekin goa or manipur main sabase zyada siten paakar bhi vah satta hasil nahin kar saki or bijepi ne baaji maar lee
 While the Congress accused the BJP of killing democracy, on the other hand, political analysts termed the sluggishness of Congress leaders as the main reason for bjp's victory
 kaha gaya ki congress netaa goa jaakar ghoomane main lage rahe or bijepi ne nirdaleeyon or kshetreey dalon ke saath milakar bahumat kaa aankada juta liya
 On the whole, the Congress was very bad and Amit Shah's strategy was fiercely discussed
 aisi hi kuch sthiti ab karnataka main ubhari he
 When the results came out on 15 May, the BJP became the single largest party with 104 seats, but it could not touch the majority figure
 jabaki duusari taraf congress or jedies ne gathjod kar liya or nirdaleey vidhayak ko bhi apane saath le liya
 Today, the situation is that BS Yeddyurappa, who was sworn in as CM, failed to prove even a majority of his government and had to resign
 vahiin, duusari taraf congress is puri rassakashi main kaaphi aage najar ai or ek ke baad ek har morche par vah bijepi ko pachhadti chali gai
 First step: On May 15, when the election results were declared, the BJP was seen crossing the majority mark in the initial trends
 lekin dopaher dhalate-dhalate uski suyin 104 tak atak gai
 On the other hand, Congress reached 78 seats and JDS 38 seats
 congress ne turant is aankade ko jodakar jedies ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kaa faisla kar liya
 Former Congress president Sonia Gandhi herself instructed her leaders present in Karnataka to talk to JDS founder HD Deve Gowda
 congress ne jedies ke echdi kumaraswami ko siem pad ofer kar diya or shaam hone se pehle hi donon dalon main gathjod ho gaya
 Second step: Congress also engaged BSP supremo Mayawati to talk to JDS
 mayawati ne karnataka main jedies ke saath milakar chunaav ladaa tha or unki party ke ek vidhayak ne jeet bhi darj kii he
 The Congress also used this weapon to bring the JDS together
 teesraa kadam:15 may ko jab jedies se baat ban gai to congress ne rajyapal se milane kaa vakt maanga or jedies ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kar diya
 BJP leader Yeddyurappa presented the claim of the government at 5 pm and followed them 5
 30 baje jedies or congress netaa rajbhavan pahunch gaye or apni chitthee rajyapal ko saunp di
 Fourth step: Amidst this whole development, reports started coming that some mlas of Congress and JDS are in touch with BJP
 bijepi ke is waar kaa palatwaar karte hue jedies or congress ne bijepi par apane vidhayakon kii kharid ke liye 100 karod ke pralobhan kaa aarope laga daalaa
 Later, the Congress also claimed to have evidence of BJP leaders trying to buy mlas
 floor test se pehle congress ne bies yediurppa, shriramulu or duusarebijapi netaaon ke audio clipabhi jari kiye
 Fifth step: Congress and JDS also did not let their mlas separate
 16 may ko donon partiyon ke vidhayakon kii rajbhavan tak parade tak kara di gai or rajyapal ko 117 vidhayakon ke hastakshar vaala patr tak saunp diya
 Sixth step: Congress gathered its mlas and deposited them in Bengaluru's Eagleton Resort
 iske baad khatra mandaraata dekh vidhayakon ko bengalooru se hyderabad bheja gaya
 Seventh step: night 8 on 16 May
 30 baje rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa bhej diya
 After which Yeddyurappa announced his swearing in as Chief Minister at 9 am on May 17
 yediurppa ko 15 din main bahumat sabit karne kaa mauka mila
 The Congress questioned the Governor's decision and knocked the door of the Supreme Court in the night
 congress or jedies kii arjeeper raat paune do baje supreme court main 3 jajon kii bench ne sunwaayee shuru kii or subah 5
 The debate was completed in the Supreme Court at 27 pm
 yediurppa kii shapath ko supreme court se hari jhandi mil gai
 But the court ordered the case to be heard again and in the day's hearing, the court ordered Yeddyurappa to prove his majority within 24 hours
 sunwaayee ke dauraan sarkaar kii taraf se pesh vakil ne yahaan tak kaha ki bahumat sabit karne ke liye somvaar tak kaa vakt diya jaae, kyonki vidhayak baahar hai
 On this, the Congress lawyer said that his mlas would return within 24 hours
 aathvaan kadam:bies yediurppa ne 17 may kii subah siem pad kii shapath le lee
 After this, Congress and JDS strongly opposed it
 yahaan tak ki donon partiyon ke varisht netaa vidhansabha ke baahar dharne par baith gaye
 Congress leaders sat on a dharna in the scorching sun with regard to former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda
 yahaan tak ki deshbhar main loktantr bachaao ke aahvaan ke saath deshbhar main dharne-pradarshan bhi karaae
 Ninth step: On May 18, the Governor selected BJP MLA KG Bopaiah as the temporary speaker to run the newly formed assembly
 is par virodh shuru ho gaya
 The Congress reached the Supreme Court in the night and K
 ji bopaiya ko protem spikar ke pad se hataane kii maang kii
 However, when the hearing took place on Saturday morning, the court rejected the Congress's demand, but the debate was quiet on whether the majority trial would be broadcast live
 congress ne ise bhi apni jeet ke rup main liya
 Tenth step: Before the floor test today, all the mlas in the Assembly took oath
 is dauraan lunch ke vakt sadan kii kaarywahi sthagit kar di gai
 During the lunch too, the Congress did not allow its mlas to come in contact with any BJP leader and the packets were sent to the mlas for lunch
 baad main bijepi sutron se ye jaankaree bhi mili ki bijepi kaa plan lunch ke dauraan hicongress or jedies vidhayakonse sampark banane or unhen samarthan ke liye manaane kaa tha, lekin aisa bhi nahin ho paaya or unhone sadan ke andar istipha dene kaa elaan kar diya

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has decided a new formula for the selection of candidates who want ticket in Lok Sabha elections
 congress party ne 7 survey karaae hai, iske aadhaar par pratyaashiyon ke naam tay kiye jaaenge
 Congress president Rahul Gandhi, party general secretaries Priyanka Gandhi and Ahmed Patel have conducted these surveys at their respective levels
 iske alaava congress ne shakti ap ke jariye bhi ek survey kiya he
 Apart from this, one name has been asked for each seat from the state in-charge
 congress ne desh kii kul 543 loksabhaa siton main se 350 siton par survey karaae hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has conducted 4 surveys
 jabaki congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi or party ke koshadhyaksh ahamed patel ne bhi ek-ek survey karaae hai
 Apart from this, a survey has been done by Congress through its Shakti app
 congress ke ummidavaaron ke chayan main sabase zyada tavajjo shakti ap ke dwaara kiye survey ko di ja rahi he
 The Congress had decided a total of 100 points for the seven surveys
 lekin shakti ap ke jariye kiye gaye survey ko sabase zyada 22 point die gaye hai
 Significantly, the Congress had created a Shakti app to connect directly with grassroots activists and provide their feedback
 maujuuda samay main 60 lakh se zyada kaaryakarta is ap ke madhyam se congress se jude hai
 It is believed that the survey conducted through the Shakti app has the opinion of the grassroots activists, hence special attention is being given to this survey
 iske alaava congress alaakaman ne rajyon ke party prabhariyon se loksabhaa seat ke ummidavaar ke taur par ek-ek naam maange hai
 Whereas the first in-charge used to give 2 to 3 names
 aise main prabhariyon kii tension bad gai he, unhen is baat kaa dar sata rahaa he ki unhone jo naam bheje hai agar shakti ap ke madhyam se wo naam nahin aae to unka kya hoga
 This is the reason why many in-charge of the states are taking great precautions regarding the selection of the candidate's name
 haalanki party ne tay kiya he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi, priyanka gandhi or ahamed patel or shakti ap ke jariye karaae survey main se ek naam tay kiye jaaenge
 After this, the name suggested by the in-charge of the states will also be put forward
 aise main agar prabharee dwaara bheje gaye naam or survey se tay kiye gaye naam ek rahete hai to is sthiti main uske naam loksabhaa chunaav ke ummidavaari par muhar lag jaaegi
 If both the names remain different, then in such a situation, a survey will be conducted once again on that parliamentary seat
 isamen jiske naam par zyada sahmati rahegi use party apana ummidavaar ghoshit karegi
 In several states including Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, the Congress has conducted surveys to select the candidate
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye congress koi kor kasar nahin chhodana chaahati

 Saturn has a keen eye on those who indulge in bad deeds, even if those bad deeds are known or unknown
 in 6 jagahon par virajman hai shanidev
 
 
 Let's know about the effect of Shani Dev's crooked eye
 
 
 mahatvapurn he shani kii drushtishani santulan or nyaay kaa grah he
 If wrong and dishonest people suffer, then honest, hardworking people are rewarded
 shani ko seemaa grah kaha jaataa he kyonki jahaan surya kaa prabhaav khatm hota he vahiin se shani kaa prabhaav shuru hota he
 Astrologers believe that the sight of Saturn is very important
 - har grah ke paas ek hi drushti hoti he jise saatvi drushti ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 - But Jupiter, Mars and Saturn also have other visions
 - samast grahon main sabase zyada taqatvar drushti shani kii hoti he
 In addition to the seventh, it also has third and tenth vision
 - ye drushti jis grah, bhav yaa vyakti par padati he uskaa naash ho jaataa he
 - The sight of Saturn falling on different planets produces different side effects
 hanumanji kii puja se shant rahete hai shanidev
 
 
 Shani will punish bad deeds- If deeds are condemnable, Shani will give bad luck
 - bure karmon par shani kangaal bana denge
 - Shani kills the conscience of those who do bad deeds
 - shani kaa bura asar hone par nirnay shakti kaam nahin karti
 - Saturn's crooked eye always leads to failure
 - shani kii tedi najar se chidchidapan bana rahata he
 What will be the effect of the movement of Shani, good deeds will get you blessed
 Shani is blessed by Shani Dev
 - shanidev shubh karm waalon kii dhan-sampatti kaa sadupyog karaate hai
 - Shanidev makes family life enjoyable
 - dharm kii raah par chalane kii prerana dekar tapasya ko badhaate hai
 Swastik will do every wish to see the effect of the planets
 By knowing all these things, you must have understood one thing that Shanidev does not just do bad but he is good with bad people and good with bad people
 jyotish ke jaankaron kaa ye maananaa he ki shani kii tedi najar grahon ke anusaar alag-alag dushprinaam detii he
 - Married life of a person is bad if sight is on the Sun
 - isse pita putr main sambandh achche nahin hote hai
 - If the moon is on, intense quietness is produced
 - isse vyakti sanyasi yaa maansik rogi hota he
 - If Saturn is on Mars, an explosion-like situation occurs
 - iske prabhaav se prachand durghatana ke yoga banate hai
 - If you see on Mercury then the person is cunning, clever
 - lekin isse twachaa kii samasya ho jaati he
 If the person is sighted on Jupiter then the person is a patient of stomach
 - isse gyani or ahamkaari bhi hota he
 - If Venus is on sight then the character becomes defect
 - rahu yaa ketu par drushti ho to vyakti nashe kaa shikaar hota he
 - But sometimes you get success in politics
 jaane puja main dhoop-deep kaa mahatvashani kii drushti hogi laabhakaari- jab shani apni raashi yaa ucch raashi ko dekhtaa ho
 - When Saturn is in Aries, Cancer or Leo
 - jab shani par brihaspati kii drushti ho
 - When Saturn is in Aquarius sign
 - jab shani kii drushti laabhakaari ho to vyakti ko dhan banaata he
 Also, the person succeeds by going away from home
 shani kii krupa paane ke liye in baton kaa rakhen dhyanjyotish ke jaankaron kaa ye maananaa he ki shani kii krupa paane ke liye kuch baton kaa dhyaan rakhana behad jaruri he
 Let us know when and how to get the grace of Shani
 
 
 -jab vyakti satya bolta he or anushaasit rahata he
 - When a person serves the weak and weak people a lot
 - jab vyakti apane bade bujurgon kii seva karata he
 - When a person plants fruitful and long-lived trees
 - jab vyakti bhagwaan shiv kii yaa krishna kii niyam purvak upasna karata he
 Some simple remedies will please Shani, if Saturn gets angry then troubles arise in life
 aise main ye jaananaa jaruri he ki shani kii buree najar se bachane ke upaay kya hai
 So that the grace of Saturn remains on you
 jyotish main kuch saral upaay hai jinhen apanaakar aap shani kii tedi najar se batch sakate hai
 - Never see any idol of Shani which has eyes of Shani
 - har shanivaar ke din laal vastra dhaaran karke hanuman ji ke saamne khadey hon
 - Recite Hanuman Chalisa
 - roj shaam pashchim disha kii ore deepak jalaakar shani dev ke mantra kaa jaap karen
 - Be nice to the little ones and helpers of the house
 - nile rang kaa adhik se adhik prayog karen
 Along with this, you can please Shani with some other measures
 
 
 - jivan main eemaandaar bane, satya bolen or bade bujurgon ko sammaan den
 - Add water to basil plant and peepal
 - shanivaar siankal sarson ke tel kaa deepak chauraahey yaa pipal ke neeche jalaaen
 Never cut green trees, do not get an abortion
 - suryoday ke purv avashya jaagen or shiv ji kii upasna karen
 - Chant Shani Dev's original mantra 'om Shan Shanishrai Namah'
 santanheen dampatiyon ke liye yah ek acchhee khabar ho sakati he, kyonki naye adhyayan main kaha gaya he ki dhoop senkane se purushon or mahilaon donon kii prajnan kshamta ko badhaane main madad mil sakati he

 Shahid Kapoor is in need of a hit movie after the last year's film Batti Gul Meter Chalu flopped badly
 21 june ko cinemagharon main shahid kapur kii romantic drama kabir singh relies ho rahi he
 Directed by Sandeep Wanga, the film stars Shahid Kapoor opposite Kiara Advani
 beintahaa pyaar kii anokhi kahani par bani ye film blockbster telugu film arjuna reddy kii hindi rimek he
 Vijay Devarakonda and Shalini Pandey starrer Arjun Reddy was well received by fans
 is film ne vijay devarkonda ke staradam ko nai oonchai di thi
 Now Kabir Singh's song and trailer are also getting tremendous response from the fans
 movie ke pehle din 7 karod kamaane kaa anumaan bhi saamne aa rahaa he
 Explains the 5 reasons why this film of Shahid Kapoor can be seen
 # 1
 Hard Core Romantic Dramaakbir Singh is the first hard core romantic drama released this year
 ye ek aise aashiq kii kahani he, jo pyaar main haarane ke baad khud ko tabah karne kii thaanta he
 He is drowned in love, losing his family, career and everything
 yangsters ke bich romantak filmon kaa craij aksar dekha gaya he
 Anyway, these days, love stories showing the extent of insanity in Bollywood are rarely made
 # 2
 The biggest reason for watching the blockbuster film Arjun Reddy's remake of Bir Singh is the remake of the Telugu film Arjun Reddy
 is movie kii safalataa dekhne ke baad diarector sandip wanga ne iskaa hindi varjan banane kaa faisla kiya
 Makers say that they have made a slight change in the script of Kabir Singh
 logon ke bich ye dekhne kii utsukata he ki kabir singh original movie arjuna reddy se kitni alag he
 # 3
 shahid kapur kaa laud kairactorshahid kapur ne udata punjab, kamine or haidar jaisi filmon main laud karactor play kiya he
 Shahid Kapoor's acting in all these movies was highly appreciated
 kabir singh main shahid kaa kairactor agressive, laud or strong he
 It will be interesting to see the actor on screen, rough look, stubborn attitude and insanity
 # 4
 Kiara Advani is playing the character of Shalini Pandey in Saadgikbir Singh of Kiara Advani
 arjuna reddy main shalini pandey kaa role vijay devarkonda se kam tha
 But he won the hearts of the audience with his simplicity, expression and strong acting
 kiyaara bhi last stories or em es dhoni main apni acting kaa jalawaa bikher chuki hai
 Kiara plays a non glamorous role in Kabir Singh
 dekhnaa hoga ki apni saadagi se ve darshakon ko kitna impress kar paaengi
 # 5
 do hafton ke saath badi relies5 june ko id par cinemagharon main salmaan khan kii bharat relies hui thi
 No major film has been released for two weeks since then
 haalanki bich main taapasi pannu kii gemover relies hui thi
 But this small budget movie is earning less
 bharat kii kamai bhi dhimi ho gai he
 In such a situation, Kabir Singh will be a good option for the audience

 43-year-old Omar Abdullah is leading a state where the new generation neither knows terrorism nor the Jannat drenched with brotherhood and love
 ve bas badmijaaj kism kii shanti se hi parichit hai

Apart from this, it is also worth noting that because these are three big films, then screens, footfalls and business will be divided between them

 " yahi vajah he ki jameen se uskaa sampark kataa hua he
 The relationship between the rivalry of Baba Saheb's legacy of grabbing and the reversal of the fortunes of the two national parties BJP and Congress has given rise to the race to grab the legacy of Bhim Rao Ambedkar, the greatest Dalit hero of the country
 bijepi jis gambhirtha se dalit voton kaa peechha kar rahi he, vah beete dashak ke dauraan ambedkar par party ke you-turn se saaf pataa lagata he—atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar main aalaa mantri rahe arun shouri ne kabhi unhen ''jhuthe bhagwaan" kii sangya di thi jabaki modi sarkaar ne bharat ke saamaajik or rajnatik tanebane main ambedkar ke yogadan kaa utsav manaane ke liye silsilewar kaaryakramon kii shuruyaat kii he
 The RSS mouthpiece Organizer is also using "ultimate Unifier" (unifying All) in Ambedkar's honor
 pichley november main apni landan yatra ke dauraan modi ne us jagah par ek smarak kaa anaavaran kiya, jahaan ambedkar landan skool of iconomics ke dinon main rahaa karte the
 The Prime Minister also laid the foundation stone of the Ambedkar memorial in Mumbai and laid the foundation stone of an auditorium on 25, Alipur Road, Delhi, on 21 March, where Ambedkar died
 unhone bhartiya samvidhan ke janak ko unke janmasthal indore ke mau main bhi shradhanjali di, us din ko saamaajik samarasata diwas ghoshit kiya or sanyukt raashtra ko ambedkar kaa 125waan janmdiwas manaane ko taiyaar kiya
 At the start of this stormy program of Modi on Ambedkar, the Congress got a big shock, but it woke up late and accepted his historic neglect on his part
 raju kehete hai, ''samvidhan nirmaan kaa kaam unhone congress ke saath hi milakar kiya tha, lekin hamane 125wein janmdiwas tak unki viraasat ko apnaane kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 First the BSP captured him, now all the parties are doing the same
 " ambedkar par apana daawa jataane ke liye congress ne unke janmdiwas par nagpur main ek badi raily yojit kii
 As expected, both the parties had to listen to the scandal of BSP chief Mayawati, who is the original contender of Ambedkar's legacy
 ambedkar ke 125wein janmdiwas par lakhanu main ek vishaal raily ko sambodhit karte hue unhone bijepi or congress par aarope lagaaya ki ye partiyaan dalit vot batorne ke liye ambedkar ke naam kaa sirf istemaal kar rahi hai jabaki unhone ateet main kabhi bhi ambedkar yaa daliton ke kalyaan kii koi parvaah nahin kii
 Dalit-centric opposition? After the incident of Una and the indecent remarks of BJP leader Dayashankar Singh on Mayawati, a major change in the electoral politics associated with Dalits is that the BSP has got a new lease of life
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main baari niraashajanak pradarshan ke kaaran kai bade netaaon ne mayawati kaa saath chhod diya lekin bemaani hoti ja rahi party achaanak phir surkhiyon main aa gai he
 The loss of Dalit support and the turn of the Brahmins towards the BJP did not show the possibility of a dalit-brahmin equation like the 2007 assembly elections for the BSP
 lekin dayashankar singh kii tippanee ke baad bispi ne lakhanu main baari raily karke apni takat kii numaaish kii
 On the other hand, the Congress's Dalit strategy in the state, which projected Sheila Dixit as the chief ministerial candidate, is very clear
 usne rajya ke sabhi 75 jilon se 400 yuvaaon kii toli taiyaar kii he, jo daliton ke tolon main jaakar dalit kalyaan ke liye congress ke kaam or uski bhavishya kii nitiyon ke bare main bataaegi
 Says Raju, "earlier our message was for those above 35 years of age
 ab ham 18 se 35 varsh umr waalon par focus kar rahe hai
 "the Congress will issue two manifestos before the 2017 assembly elections to regain lost ground in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab
 ek, saamaanya chunavi vaadon vaala, or duusare, ek vishesh dalit ghoshnaa-patr, jo is mahatvapurn rajnatik varg par focus hoga
 The ruling SP in Uttar Pradesh has also recently activated its SC / ST branch and plans to organize Dalit Maha Sammelan in all 18 divisions of the state
 vah khaskar paasi, valmiki, kori or beria jaisi jatiyon par focus kar rahi he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in the second electoral state of Punjab, the Dalit votes cast by the Congress and the BSP had turned mainly to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), winning four of its mps
 ab dalit jatiyon ko aakarshith karne ke liye aap kii vishesh yojana he
 On March 15, the anniversary of BSP founder Dalit leader late Kanshi Ram will address the public meeting of Chief Minister of Delhi, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal at his ancestral village Prithipur Banga in Ropar district
 usamen kanshiram kii bahan swaran cor mukhya atithi ke rup main maujuud rahengi
 Around 40 percent of the voters in four districts of Punjab, Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahar are Dalits
 kejariwal kii deraa balaan main ravidaas samudaay or jalandhar main valmiki samudaay ke logon se bhi baat hui he
 a month ago, he visited the family of the brutally slaughtered Dalit Bhim Tank in 2015 in the border district of Abohar, the farmhouse of liquor mafia Shivlal Doda
 doda kii kai tasviren up-mukhyamantri sukhbir singh badal ke saath milti hai
 There, Kejriwal announced a job in the Delhi government to a member of the Tank family and promised that if you come to power in Punjab, you will punish the culprits within two months
 congress ke liye daliton ko waapas apane paale main laana behad jaruri he, jo punjab main kabhi uskaa mukhya aadhaar hua karte the
 For this purpose, the party organized a two-day seminar for Dalits in February
 lekin party ko pichley maheene rajyasabha chunaavon main jhatka laga
 In the election for two seats from the state of the party in the Upper House, one had to bear the brunt of the tussle between Ravidas and Valmiki community
 valmiki samudaay ke hans raaj hans party kaa tikat nahin paa sake
 In his place, Shamsher Singh Dulhan of Ravidas community got the ticket
 uske baad hans raaj hans ne congress ko samarthan na dene kaa elaan kar diya
 The party is now trying to make up for it
 amarinder singh ravidaas samudaay ke deraa sachkhand balaan kaa daura kar rahe hai or kapoorthala main valmiki-majahabi sikh sacvamelan yojit kar rahe hai
 Congress leader Joginder Singh Mann has even demanded that half of the protected seats in the elections be given to Valmikis
 amarinder 13 farvari ko ravidaas samudaay ke dharmaguru deraa pramukh sant niranjan das se mili
 On the other hand, BJP has also made Union Minister Vijay Sampla, the prominent Dalit face of the party, the party president in the state to woo the Dalit votes in Punjab
 bijepi ne apni essi shakha kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak 21 may ko jalandhar main kii
 The party is also not avoiding criticism of ally Shiromani Akali Dal for wooing Dalits
 uski essi shakha ke adhyaksh dushyant gautam ne dalit kalyaan fund ko duusare mad main kharch karne ke liye rajya sarkaar kii khinchaai kii
 The Akali Dal is also not behind in this competition
 rajya sarkaar ne ravidaas samudaay ko khush karne ke liye hoshiyarpur ke khuralgarh main shri guru ravidaas smarak kii neenv rakhi
 It is Rs 110 crore
 main bananaa he
 Suddenly, the importance of Khuralgarh has increased in the Akali Dal election map
 mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ne elaan kiya ki ise kaashi main guru ravidaas ke janmasthal govardhan kii tarj par ''vishwa-stareey paryatak sthal" banaaya jayega
 Critics of the muslim-dalit equation BJP see double play in the party's new Dalit strategy
 ek, musalamaanon ke bainks hindu samaaj ko ekajute karnaa or duusare, dalit-musalmaan sameekaran ko toduya
 This thinking has emerged in 2015 after Asaduddin Owaisi's party All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) benefited from the dalit-muslim equation in Maharashtra
 eiemiem aurangabad nagar nigam chunaavon main 113 siton ke sadan main 25 siten jitkar shivasena ke baad duusare number par pahunch gai
 BJP is at number three there
 vahaan eiemiem ke chaar dalit or ek obisi ummidavaar jite
 This is not the first time the attempt to bring Dalits and Muslims on one stage in Maharashtra
 bispi or congress uttar pradesh main aisa sameekaran banane kii koshish main hai jabaki bijepi aise kisi sameekaran ko shuru main hi khatm karne ke prati patibaddh lagati hai
 Because of this equation between Muslims and Dalits, the bjp's student wing ABVP decided to clash with the Dalit organization Ambedkar Students Association, of which Rohit Vemula was a member
 abivipi ke rashtriya sanghathan sachiv sunil ambekar kehete hai, ''ye dalit samooh afjal guru or yaqub memon kaa mudda kyon uthaa rahe hai? islamic takaton or naksal guton ke bich ek nayaa gathjod ubhar rahaa he
 They are trying to woo Dalit and other marginalized communities of Hindu society
 " bijepi ne june 2014 main muradabad main ek dalit mandir se laudspikar hataane kii ghatana ko lekar daliton or musalamaanon main danga bhadakaane kii bhi koshish kii lekin safal nahin ho pai
 However, creating a possible equation between these two vote bank groups is part of the Congress strategy to present a cut of hindu-muslim polarization
 isi dhruvikaran kii vajah se bijepi ne 2014 ke chunaavon main baari kamyaabi pai thi
 Says Raju, "both our party's minority and SC branches are working in tandem
 "bif par pabandi or 2015 main dadri cond jaisi vaardaat se bhi vipaksh ko dalit-musalmaan sameekaran banane main madad mil rahi he
 Vidyut Thakar, a political analyst from Gujarat, says, "the BJP may find it difficult to overcome these setbacks
 rashtriya str par vipaksh 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke maddenjar modi ke khilaaf dalit-musalmaan sameekaran banane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 "perhaps the issues of Dalits or Muslims will continue to be effective
 in samudaayon ke saath ekajutata dikhaane ke liye dikhaawati aayojan bhi hote rahenge lekin jamini vaastaviktaaen kab badalengi? shaayad shah, rahul gandhi, kejariwal yaa kisi bhi netaa se kisi dalit ke ghar bhojan par jane ke pehle yah sawaal poocha janaa chahie ki 5,000 ru

 (- Uday Mahurkar) uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantrikhilesh yadavane shuukravaar ko vidhansabha main chaalu vitt varsh (2012-13) ke liye bajet pesh kiya
 Akhilesh also has the Finance Department of the state, so as the Finance Minister, he presented the budget of the 16th Assembly in the House at 11 am
 bajet main jahaan ek ore samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke ghoshnaa patr kii tasviir spasht rup se najar aati he, vahiin duusari ore purvavarti sarkaar kii kai yojanaon par gaaj bhi giraayi gai he
 Chief Minister Akhilesh began his budget speech with a vote of thanks to the public
 unhone kaha ki janata ne bahumat kii sarkaar banaai he to unki ummiido par khara utarana sarkaar kii jimmedaari he
 Akhilesh said that due to the scams in the previous BSP government, the state is in a huge economic deficit
 unhone jaise hi basapa sarkaar kaa naam liya, vaise hi sadan main maujuud basapa sadasyon ne hangaamaa shuru kar diya
 Akhilesh said that the Kanya Vidya Dhan Yojana will be started once again by the government
 unhone kaha ki berogari bhatte ke liye sarkaar ne 1,100 karod rupee kaa praavdhaan kiya he, jabaki laptop or tablet ke liye 2,721 karod rupee kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 In the budget, a provision of Rs 7033 crore has been made for health facilities, Rs 5432 crore for agriculture sector
 akhilesh ne shiksha kshetra par dhyaan dete hue iske liye 33,623 karod rupee kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 a provision of Rs
 10 thousand crore for law and order and Rs
 1400 crore for social welfare has also been made in the budget of Akhilesh in the state
 power sector ke liye bhi 8225 karod rupeya kaa praavdhaan he
 Significantly, due to the body elections in the state, the model code of conduct is in force, due to which the government has avoided making new announcements in the budget
 mahilaayein mahfuz mahasoos karen ye puraa desh chahta he
 But to realize this, what endless rights can be given to someone against someone? This question is also arising because

 kis zurm par kitni sazaa he mantri samooh dwaara paas kiye gaye anti rape kanoon main:- rape par umr kaid
 Life imprisonment for throwing acid
 - naaballig se dushkarm par umr kaid
 But what is shocking is that most of the crimes have been made illegal in this law
 - taak jhaank karnaa gaiyr jamaanti hoga
 - Stalking will be in the category of non-bailable offense
 - kisi mahila ko ghurkar dekhnaa bhi gairazmaanti
 - If he repeatedly splashes, he is also non-bailable
 - matlab koi purush trephic jam main funs gaya ho or ittefaq se uski car kisi mahila kii car ke peeche ho to mahila usapar peechha karne kaa aarope laga sakati he or uski zamaanat nahin hogi
 Similarly, if you are trying to identify a woman and if the woman does not like it, then she can dial 100 number and get it inside
 - agar koi purush kaam karte hue kisi mahila kii taraf bich-bich main dekh letaa he to wo gaiyr jamaanti aparaadh kaa bhagidaar he
 And the woman's statement to the police will be final
 - had ye he ki agar mahila juthi nikali to uske khilaaf koi karrwai nahin hogi
 Things have become such that everyone is craving to get free smart phones in Chhattisgarh to take advantage of the Sanchar Kranti Yojana (sky scheme)
 darasal, is yojana ke tahat sarkaar free main smart phone dene vaali he
 Although this phone will be available only to BPL families, but every section is trying to get it

 For this, the form reached out to the eligible beneficiaries of the scheme

 Only one daughter has topped the CBSE examination results recently
 aise main betiyon ko sirf gharelu kaamkaaji ke rup main dekhnaa hamaari pitrusattatmak soch ke alaava kuch nahin he

 haalanki kuch logon kaa yah bhi kahana ki, yah aid un logon ko dhyaan main rakhkar likhaa gaya he jo kam padhe-likhe hai or aasaani se baat samaj sakate hai

 Prior to the decision, a meeting of top leaders was going on at the house of Chief Minister Palaniswami

 If the verdict goes against the AIADMK, then it is also being talked about

 sidney ke cafe main jari bandhak sankat main ek bhartiya ke ghire hone kii jaankaree kaa sarkaar kii taraf se khandan kiya gaya he
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu said that there was no confirmation of this information as to whether an Indian was trapped there
 isse pehle venkaiya naidu ne hi sansad bhawan main patrakaron se baat karte hue vahaan ek bhartiya ke fanse hone kii baat kahi thi
 It was also told that he is an IT professional and the Ministry of External Affairs is constantly in touch with the Indian High Commission in Australia
 haalanki videsh mantralay kii taraf se ab tak aisi koi jaankaree nahin di gai he ki bandhakon main koi bhartiya bhi he
 It usually comes under the responsibilities of the Ministry of External Affairs that if necessary, any information related to any kind of problem occurring abroad with any Indian should come up
 is tarah kii koi bhi jaankaree saajha karne ke pehle sarkaar uske laabh-haani ke pahalu kii bhi padtaal karti he, lekin is maamle main venkaiya aadhi-adhuri jaankaree ke saath hi media ke saath baat kar baithe lihaaza unhen apane shabd waapas lene pade
 The hostage crisis is a serious matter and any information about an Indian being surrounded there further increases the sensitivity of the case for India
 aisi kisi surat main bhartiya pahchaan saamne aane se vah aatankwaadi ke nishane par pehle aa saktaa he isliye venkaiya ne beshak khabar ko apusht bataa diya ho, lekin media or soshal media ke is jamaane main munh se nikali hui kisi bhi jaankaree ko control karnaa naammumkin he

 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki is beemaari se bachane kii dawa temi flu bechney ke liye 17 dukaanon ko license diya gaya he, lekin jab aaj tak kii team ne in dukaanon kaa jayja liya to pataa chalaa ki in dukaanon par temi flu uplabdh hi nahin he
 When the team reached the shops of different government hospitals also, the situation there was the same
 kai dukaanon par mask tak nahin the
 When asked about the government hospital officials, their reply was that there is a shortage of masks at present and due to lack of medicines, people are not getting medicines from the shop
 is beemaari se ladane ke liye dilli se bhi ek team bulaai gai he
 Vasundhara Raje has also formed a task force that is monitoring the entire matter
 haalanki, sach to yah he ki sarkari mahakama maamle main der se jaagaa he
 When the death toll starts increasing, the government has lost its sleep
 lekin in sab ke baavjood dawaaon kii kami ek gambhir mudda he
 If the lack of medicines remains the same, then it can prove to be dangerous for people struggling with this disease

 When asked about the suggestions of senior BJP leader LK Advani for holding elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies at one time, Pranab said that the decision has to be taken by political parties as different states are running governments in different states

 samvidhan main jab bhi kisi rajya main sarkaar gir jaati he to chah maheene ke andar chunaav karaane honge yaa agar raashtrapati shashan he to ek saal se zyada samay nahin laga sakate
 How will we proceed with such a possibility in the Constitution

 yah match kab or kahaan kaa he soshal media par is baat kii jaankaree nahin di gai he lekin shot khilne vaale ballebaaj kaa naam hugo hamend bataaya ja rahaa he jo ki england ke cricketer hai
 However, this has not been confirmed
 lekin soshal media par is ballebaaj ke shot ko heliscoop kaa naam diya ja rahaa he
 The trend of scoring runs has increased in the changing format of cricket
 20 overon ke match main ballebaaj 8-10 ran prati over kii rate se ran banaate hai or aise main unhen is tarah keshots kii khojkerani padati he
 In cricket, Dilshan's switch hit by Dilskoop and Kevin Pietersen have become quite popular but this shot is probably the first shot of its kind as it looks like a mix of many different shots
 swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par desh ke sabase bade aspataal ames kii ore marijon ko raahat di gai he
 Now tests worth less than 500 rupees will be free at AIIMS
 ames is yojana par kaam kar rahaa he or jald hi ise lagu kiya jayega
 This proposal will be sent to the Ministry of Health
 agar yah prastaav paas hota he to marijon koems main blad test, eks-re, ultrasound test jaise kai teston ke liye apni jeb se paisa kharch nahin hoga
 Director of AIIMS Drs
 randeep guleria ke anusaar, aspataal abhi is yojana par kaam kar rahaa he
 If this scheme is implemented then we will have to increase the fees of private wards
 angreji akhbaar hindustan times ke mutabik, ames main har roj lagbhag 10,000 se zyada marij aise aate hai
 Which gets these tests done
 vahiin lagbhag 2000 log rojaanaa aspataal main bhartee kiye jate hai
 AIIMS earns about 101 crores every year only through these tests, admission fees and registration fees
 ames ne yah faisla 15 doctoron kii cameti banane ke baad kiya he
 The committee was working on what kind of problems the patients coming to the hospital have to face
 randeep guleria ke anusahospataal main lagbhag 266privet room hai, agar ham privet ward kaa paisa badhaate bhi hai to isse logon ko zyada fark nahin padegaa
 Because in any private hospital, the charge of a room would be around 5000 or 10,000, but in AIIMS this facility is quite cheap

 She was so insulted that she wept

 The case is during the press conference of the thriller Tamil film 'bijheethiru'
 dhamsika film kii baaki star cast ke saath maujuud thim
 During this time, he thanked his co-stars and crew in the film
 lekin vah apane thanks massej main tii rajendra kaa naam bolnaa bhul gayi
 Singer and music composer t Rajendra was present there
 vah itnaa bhadak gaye ki dhamsika ko 'maryaada' par lacture dene lage
 The actress, who has described herself as the daughter of PM Modi, had appeared in this film, even though Dhansika touched T
 Rajendra's feet and apologized for her mistake and said that she respects him sincerely
 chook se unka naam bolnaa bhul gayi thim
 Dhansika repeatedly apologized to him, but t Rajendra kept saying that he did not even know how someone is respected
 
 
 had to tab ho gai jab tii rajendra ne maryaada par lacture dete hue dhamsika ke kapadon tak par coment kar diya
 T
 Ragendra also publicly heard the khuti khoti for not wearing her sari
 tii rajendra kaa dhamsika ko lekar gussa jaise tham hi nahin rahaa tha, vah lagaataar actress ko latadte ja rahe the
 Seeing this, Dhansika could not handle herself and tears started flowing from her eyes
 Film review: rajnikant ke phens ke liye he 'kabali'sabase hairaani kii baat ye thi ki kiseectress ke saath bhari media ke samneis kadar pesh aane par vahaan maujuud film se jude ek shaks ne bhi tii rajendra ko roka nahinor naa hi kisi ne unhen chup karne ko kaha

 Due to which Dhansika has also thanked her fans on Twitter for this step

 Rajendra
 tollywood main unhen isi tarah ke vyavhaar ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Earlier, he had sent a legal notice to the makers of the Tamil film 'romeo Geolit' for mocking his voice
 uttar pradesh main sattadhari party or yadav parivaar main chal rahe jhagade par pradesh ke musalmaan kaaphi baariki se dekh rahe hai
 In view of the tensions that are going on between Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Samajwadi Party state president Shivpal Yadav, the Muslims of UP are currently in some dilemma
 2012 main samaajawaadee party ko satta main laane main muslim matadaataaon ne aham role adaa kiya tha
 But after the ongoing war between the Samajwadi Party, the Muslims are watching what ends in it
 devband ke mufti mohammad arshad faruki maanate hai ki is ladaai kii vajah se do suurate haal paidaa ho rahe hai
 One is that this foot can benefit BJP because the possibility of sharing of Muslim votes can increase
 doosraa ye kismajawaadee partiko kamazor hote dekh soobe kii mukhya vipakshi party bahujan samaaj party ke saath ja sakate hai
 So that BJP can be prevented from coming to power
 mufti arshad ye maanate hai ki 'soobe kaa siyaasi manzarnama bahut khatarnaak he or musalmaan is par nazar rakh rahe hai
 'muslim society praised BSP Sameer Chaudhary, a journalist of Deoband's Urdu newspaper also believes that Muslims are definitely in dilemma due to the split in the socialist party
 ek ajeeb si kiafiyat main hai
 In such a situation, the Muslims of the state do not have to suffer harm by going with the Samajwadi Party
 samir maanate hai ki aisi stithi main bahujan samaaj party ko hi iskaa sabase zyada phayda ho saktaa he kyonki basapa ne pichley kuch saalon main musalaamanon ko kareeb laane ke liye kaaphi koshishen kii hai
 The party is now beginning to clear opinion on Muslim issues to a great extent
 haal hi main teen talaak or unifarm civil code par aae mayawati ke bayaan kii muslim samaaj saraahna kar rahaa he
 Bahujan Samaj Party will benefit from the split Many of the students of Deoband, the eldest and oldest Islamic Idare of the Order, shared their opinions openly
 ek chaatr mo
 Asadullah says that 'this was bound to happen to the Samajwadi Party, but this is the killing of Allah
 kyonki bihar vidhansabha chunaav main mulaayam singh yadav gathbandhan se alag ho gaye or isaki vajah se vahaan bijepi ko kai jagah phayda hua or unki siten badhin
 Mulayam Singh Yadav cheated
 bijepi or samaajawaadee party main koi fark nahin he
 Bahujan Samaj Party will clearly benefit from this foot
 agar basapa ke saath congress mil kar lard jaae to jeet unki tay he
 Another student, Hamza said, 'most communal riots took place in the Samajwadi Party government
 musalamaanon or daliton kii pradesh main stithi behad karaab he
 Therefore, Muslim is looking towards Bahujan Samajwadi Party due to this quarrel
 kuch chaatro ne khulkar ye bhi bataa diya ki unhone man bana liya he ki vot kise dena he
 Mo coming from Mau and studying in Deoband madrasa
 khutaiba ne kaha ki basapa ko vot dena he
 That will be in favor of Muslims
 'duusari taraf samaajawaadee party ke samarthak party main chal rahi jang se pareshaan nazar aae
 According to one such supporter Najam Qureshi, 'the way they are fighting amongst themselves, it will win communal power
 ladaai band ho
 Similarly, if the situation prevails, the Muslims will go to the BSP
 najam kuraishi kaa kahana he ki akhilesh yadav kaa jalawaa kam nahin he or agar ek saath puure man se party ladati he to nuksaan abhi bhi kuch khaas nahin hua he
 Shivpal is in the fight
 Many people of Vilnadebband who are supporters of Samajwadi Party, they were also found talking completely in favor of Akhilesh Yadav
 wo maanate hai ki is ladaai main vilan shivpal hai
 One such supporter is Moe
 abid ne kaha ki jhagada kahaan nahin hota
 Where there are 2 utensils, there is a sound
 jitna samaajawaadee party or akhilesh ne musalamaanon ke liye kiya utana kisi party ne nahin kiya
 'the Muslims have faith in Akhilesh, but the picture is still not completely clear in the state
 akhilesh yadav kii chhavi kaaphi damdaar he
 Muslims are counting on him
 party main mache ghamaasan se bhale hi nuksaan ho rahaa ho lekin abhi bhi musalamaanon ne puri tarah apana man nahin banaaya he
 It is definitely better that the sooner the quarrel in the Samajwadi Party is over, the better
 nahin to basapa ko iskaa phayda ho saktaa he

 Preparing himself for a legal battle in Singh's age dispute case, the government on Tuesday requested the Supreme Court to hear his side before passing any verdict on the general's petition

 In 1984, zakiur-rahman Lakhvi mobilized a handful of Pakistani ahl-e-hadith followers to wage jihad against the Soviet army in Afghanistan
 uske ek saal baad lahore ejineering uniwarsity main islamic adhyayan vibhaag ke do prophessoron&hafiz mohammad said or jafar ikbaal ne ahal-e-haddees kaa prachaar karne ke makasad se mukhya rup se tabalig yaa daawa par jor dene vaale ek chote se samooh jamaat-ud-daawa kaa gathan kiya
 In 1986, Lakhvi merged his jihadis with jamaat-ud-dawa and formed Markaz daawat-ul-irshad
 marakaj ke teen kaam the&jehad, ahal-e-haddees masalak kaa prasar or vichaardhaara ke liye patibaddh musalamaanon kii nai peedi taiyaar karnaa
 Within a year, Markaz set up his first jihadi training camp in Paktia province of Afghanistan & musaskar-e-taiba
 doosraa camp&muaskar-e-aksa kunar main sthapit kiya gaya
 After the Soviet army returned from Afghanistan, there was a deadly mutual war between the Mujahideen of different groups
 marakaj isse khush nahin tha or usne apana dhyaan bhartiya kashmir kii ore mode liya
 For this, he established several training camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 1990 main marakaj ne kashmir main apana pehla mishan chhedaa jab uske ladaakon ne srinagar hawaii adde kii ore ja rahi ek jeep par ghaat lagaakar hamalaa bol diya jisamen bhartiya vaayu sena ke jawan savaar the
 Attacks of Kashmiri militants on Indian security forces had become common by 1990, but by then such a precocious attack was unexpected
 1990 ke dashak ke shuruaati saal main marakaj ne apni gatividhiyon or santhnik dhaanche ko alag kar diya
 He continued to propagate the Jamaat but created a separate terrorist group known as lashkar-e-taiba
 haalanki said donon hi shakhaon kaa amir tha or uskaa donon par hi itnaa niyantran tha ki marakaj or lashkar main antar kar paanaa lagbhag naammumkin tha
 Lashkar was not set up by the isi's Shahpakistani army and his intelligence agency inter-services Intelligence (ISI), but he was sure that the strong power that Lashkar had could spoil the situation in Kashmir
 And may increase the scope of rebellion
 isiilie 1990 ke dashak ke shuruyaat se hi iesai or fouj ne lashkar ke peeche jamkar jor lagaaya
 Lashkar's strength was put to use especially against India
 lashkar kii sainya prashikshan vyavastha ko bhi durust kiya gaya
 Military personnel were deployed in Lashkar bases for Lashkar instructors
 yahi tarika ab tak chalaa aa rahaa he
 Everyone, including Sayeed himself, has some mentor in the ISI
 pakistan ne lashkar par jo kharch kiya, usentejey jald hi dikhne lage
 In a few years, lashkar-e-toiba became the biggest challenge for the Indian security forces in Kashmir
 1999 main lashkar ne bhartiya kashmir main nae kism ke hamale bolne shuru kieh fidaayin hamale
 With the help of these suicide attacks, Lashkar and his Pakistani rulers wanted to reverse the decline in terrorist activities in Indian Kashmir for three years
 lashkar ke fidaayin mishan koi “aatmghaatee hamale” nahin the balki ve atyadhik jokhim vaale mishan hote the jinamein purnatah prashikshit commando sidhi jang main utarate or pakade jane ke bajaae mar janaa pasand karte the
 Banning fraud After Pakistan jaish-e-mohammed attack on Indian Parliament in December 2001, Pakistan along with many other terrorist groups also banned Lashkar
 is hamale ke baad bharat or pakistan main jang kii naubat aa gai thi
 But no one got into the trap of these restrictions
 pakistan kii khufia agenciyon ne pabandi ke bare main aatanki guton ko pehle hi cheta diya tha jisase un sabhi ko apni rakam nae khaaton main hastantarit karne or nae naam se sakriy hone kaa mauka mil gaya tha
 In the case of Lashkar, Saeed announced that the organization has been restructured and will now operate under the name of jamaat-ud-dawa
 uske baad se pakistan sarkaar ne sanghathan par aage pabandi lagane kaa koi dhong bhi nahin kiya he
 It has ignored all the pressures of the US, UK, EU, India and the United Nations to do so
 disambar 2014 main peshawar main faujee skool ke bacchon par khooni hamale ke baad bhi, jab pakistani adhikariyon ne kasame khai thim ki ve ab achche va bure aatankwaadiyon main koi antar nahin karenge, lashkar (urf jamaat-ud-daawa) par kabhi koi khatra nahin mandaraaya
 Pakistani rulers do not consider him a "terrorist"
 darasal, said ne to yah daawa tak kiya tha ki peshawar kaa hamalaa bhartiya agenton kii karatuut thi or is hamale ke fouran baad november 2008 ke mumbai hamale ke mastermind lakhvi ko jamaanat de di gai thi
 Lakhvi was in jail since 2008
 yah ek kism kii hifaazati hiraasat hi thi
 By 2005, the new path of jihad had allowed its cadre to go to Afghanistan to support the Afghan Taliban fighting with American forces
 haalanki lashkar kaa kader zyada utsahit nahin tha kyonki use dar tha ki afghanistan kii baghawat main zyada haath jhonkne kaa matlab yah hoga ki vibhinn devbandi samoohon ke bheetar or unke saath milakar kaam karnaa hoga jo pakistan ke khilaaf bhi lard rahe the
 Lashkar interfered in the Afghan war for several reasons
 pehla, 2001 main bhartiya sansad par jaish ke hamale or phir 2002 main kaluchak (kashmir) main bhartiya sena ke pariwaron par lashkar ke hamale ke baad pakistan kashmir main apane kuchakr ko rokane ke liye majaboor ho gaya tha
 Under US pressure, General Pervez Musharraf adopted a strategy of so-called "small jihad" in which Lashkar and other jihadi groups were excluded
 isliye jo sanghathan maidan main utarane ko aatur ladaakon or anbhavi cmanderon ko apane kheme main banaae rakhana chaahate the, unhen afghanistan ek acha maidan najar aayaa
 Secondly, it was more attractive for many terrorists in Pakistan to fight the Kafirs in Afghanistan and Lashkar, like many Deobandi organizations, bowed to it
 tisare, sanghathan ke kai daandaataaon kaa maananaa tha ki america va antarrashtriya phujon dwaara kabje ke baad afghanistan ab kashmir se kahin zyada mahatvapurn manch ho gaya tha
 Fourth, India had built a very strong presence in Afghanistan under the US security umbrella, which was a matter of continued softening for Pakistan
 or sabase mahatvapurn yah ki iesai ne bhi afghanistan main sanghathan kii bhoomika ko manjuuri de di thi taaki lashkar vahaan hakkaani network ke saath milakar afghanistan main bhartiya or antarrashtriya faujee thikaanon par hamale ke liye mahatvapurn takat ban jaae
 Most of Lashkar's domestic politicians consider this organization as a terrorist organization that Pakistan uses to protect its interests in India and more recently in Afghanistan
 haalanki, lashkar kii pakistan ke bheetar bhi ek badhati or mahatvapurn bhoomika he or vah is lihaaj se ki vahi akelaa sanghathan he jo pakistani rajya-vyavastha ke khilaaf hinsak devbandi agenda kaa vaicharik virodh kar saktaa he
 The factions that have created havoc in Pakistan are Deobandi and only Deobandi carry out most communal attacks in Pakistan
 jamaat-ud-daawa pakistaniyon par hamale kaa virodh karata he or is lihaaj se vah vahaan ke hukmaranon ke haathon kaa ek ahm aujaar he jo rajya ke khilaaf khadey ho gaye devbandi jamaaton se takkar lene kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Surprisingly, despite the serious threat posed to it by regional and international security, no authentic information about the structure of this organization is publicly available
 uske sakriy kaadaron kii sankhya kaa andaja bhi kuch hajaar se lekar adhiktam pachaas hajaar ke bich he
 Saeed is the head of the organization
 vah sanghathan par kadaa niyantran rakhata he jo kai vibhaagon main banta he
 These departments are jihad, education, charity, religious affairs and public welfare
 apane adeshon ke adhiktam anupaalan ke liye said mukhya padon par apane parivaar ke logon yaa behad najdiki saathiyon ko rakhata he jo sidhe uske prati javabdeh hote hai
 Tight control over the organization and deployment of key people to the main places is the reason why this organization has not seen the same kind of tension and rebellion against the state as it has been in the various Deobandi factions who have commanded And the control structure was divided among several people
 sajid mir uske videshi kaamkaaj kaa commander he
 He became notorious in 2008 because he was the "project manager" of the 2008 Mumbai attacks
 pakistan ke bheetar apni kadi morchebandi se hi vah vyaktigat rup se mumbai hamale ko nirdeshit kar rahaa tha or hamalaavaron ke saath nirantar phone par sampark main tha
 This faction in Indian Kashmir also has a Chief Operations Commander for the Valley and a Regional Divisional Commander for the Central, North and South divisions
 phir ilaakai str par choti kaman bhi he
 How the expenditure is arranged jamat-ud-dawa primarily uses its funds for three purposes: Dawa, Khidmat and Jihad related activities (recruitment, training and arms procurement)
 magar ise pukhta rup se jaanane kaa koi jariya nahin he ki gut kaa parichaalan bajet kitna he or uskaa kitna hissaa sidhe rajya kii taraf se aata he or kitna sanghathan kii apni dhan ikattha karne kii gatividhiyon se ekatra hota he
 It is estimated that Lashkar's total annual operating budget is about $ 50 million, of which approximately $ 52 million is spent on military activities
 is parichaalan bajet se sanghathan samooche pakistan main kai prashikshan kendron kaa sanchaalan karata he
 It is also estimated that the organization spends $ 330 for each basic course tour-a-mango and $ 1,700 for each three-month advance course tour-a-special
 is baat kii sambhaavna kam hi he ki sarkaar ko uskaa puraa parichaalan kharch muhaiyaa karana hota hoga kyonki deshi va videshi daandaata sanghathanon se, online chande se, apane kai prakashnon kii bikri se, jibah kiye gaye pashuon ke chamadon kii bikri se or tamaam anya jariyon se dhan ugaahne kii gut kii apni kshamtaayen kaaphi majboot hai
 Surprisingly, the federal government of Pakistan and its Punjab state government provide indirect support to the group, while the United Nations and the United States have declared it a terrorist organization
 bharat main lashkambhi to lashkar dakshin asia kaa sabase pramukh aatankwaadi gut he
 Organizationally it has no association with Al Qaeda or its competitive Islamic State (IS)
 darasal, inamen se kisi bhi sanghathan ke saath haath milaane se uskaa sabase mahatvapurn samarthan khatre main pad jayega, or vah he pakistani shashan kaa belaag samarthan
 Although IS has greatly increased the magnitude of its violence, al Qaeda and Lashkar have always shocked the world in terms of coordinated, multi-level simultaneous attacks
 islamic state media ke centre main bane rahane ke liye is kadar barbarta barapa rahaa he ki yahaan tak ki taliban or al kaayda ne bhi ies ko islam ke naam ko kalankit karne vaale barbar vahashi qaraar diya he
 But this same barbarity has created psychological pressure on other terrorist groups to increase vandalism
 aakhirkaar, sabhi islamic aatankwaadi gut fund or kader ke liye apane hisse kii hode main to hai hi
 In some cases, the IS has shown that it does not need anyone's help, it believes in forcing people out of its barbarity
 usne apni takat ke bal par apane kabje vaale ilaakon main apana aatank kaa samrajya kaayam kiya he
 There is also a strong apprehension from his example that Lashkar can also increase his brutality
 aakhirkaar logon ke sir kalam karne kaa uskaa bhi lanbaa itihaas rahaa he
 Competing with or exceeding the barbarity of the Islamic State is within the scope of Lashkar
 vah chaahe to yah kar saktaa he lekin sawaal he ki kya pakistani hukmran isaki ijaajat denge
 India may be right in assessing that the next attack on it could be from Lashkar but by my estimation Indians should also remember Jaish who attacked the Indian Parliament
 jaish varshon se niskriy he kyonki uske zyaadaatar kader pakistani taliban ke kheme main chale gaye hai
 In recent years, the Pakistani army and the ISI have tried to revive the Jaish and bring its erstwhile cadres back to India by showing their greed to kill Indians
 yahaan yah yaad dilaayaa ja saktaa he ki jaish ne apana pehla hamalaa&2000 main aatmghaatee bam visphot&kashmir main hi kiya tha
 And unlike Lashkar, it has long relationships with Al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban, which at one time were at the forefront of worldwide barbarism
 jaish ke kuch aatanki pakistani taliban ke saath bhi kaam kar rahe hai
 It would be prudent for India to keep an eye on Jaish besides Lashkar
 pakistani fouj or iesai ko in donon hi guton kii jarurat hogi, agar use pakistan ko shant rakhane or bharat main aag lagane ke apane dohare makasad ko aage badhanaa he

 input - ieenes Amidst questions about sending a girl gang-raped in a moving bus to Singapore for treatment, the head doctor who treated her at Safdarjung Hospital and other doctors who accompanied the victim to the air ambulance voiced criticism of the decision
 Rejecting that his intention was to save the girl under any circumstances
 safadarajang aspataal ke suparintendent dow bidi athani ne kaha ki yah samay is baat ko lekar bahes karne kaa nahin he ki peedit ko singapore bhejne kaa faisla raajnneetik aadhaar par tha yaa chikitsakeey aadhaar par
 He said, the only and only intention was to save her life in every face
 puraa desh uske liye prarthana kar rahaa tha or har vyakti ko ummid thi ki vah thik ho jaaegi
 We could not give up hope
 ham uski jaan bachaana chaahate the
 Medical expert Dr Yatin Mehta of Medanta Medicity Hospital said that he was surprised by the criticism of the decision to send the victim to Singapore
 aalochanaon par pratikriya main dow mehta ne kaha, aksar doctor duusare doctoron ke faisle kii aalochana karte hai or yah sahi nahin he
 He said that the patient survived 48 hours in a hospital in Singapore and it cannot be said that he should not have been sent there
 dow mehta ne kaha, duusari baat yah he ki bharat main sarkari aspataalon or singapore ke mount elizbeth aspataal ke bich koi tulana nahin he
 i am not talking about the efficiency of doctors, but about basic facilities
 hamen yah pataa hona chahie
 Dr
 Athani stated that the victim had extremely serious injuries to the intestine and other organs
 unhone kaha, hamane uski aant kaa bahut bada hissaa sankraman kii vajah se nikaal diya tha
 The injuries were very serious
 athani ne kaha ki ilaaj ke baad shuruaati paanch din tak ladki kii haalat sthir thi or sudhaar ke sanket dikh rahe the, lekin sepsis (rakt main sankraman) hone kii vajah se uski haalat bighad gai
 The doctor said, his willpower was strong and he gave two statements to the police
 vah hosh main thi
 Athani said that the para-medical student was treated well at Safdarjung Hospital and after being taken to Mount Elizabeth Medical Center, Singapore by air ambulance
 singapore kaa aspataal ek saath anek angon ke pratiropan kii suvidhaon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Athani said that well-known celebrities like actor Rajinikanth and politician Amar Singh from India went there for treatment and have recovered
 dow mehta ne kaha ki ladki kii haalat dilli kii tulana main vahaan zyada bighad gai
 "we met him before leaving for Delhi on Friday," he said
 dilli kii tulana main uski haalat zyada kharaab ho gai thi
 He had very serious injuries and we tried our best to save him
 mehta ne bhi kaha ki peedit ko hawaii ambulance se singapore le jane kaa faisla isliye kiya gaya, kyonki vah aspataal ang pratiropan ke liye behtareen aspataalon main se ek he
 Another main reason was that the first objective was to save his life
 dow athani ne kaha, vah bahut bahadur ladki thi
 He said that the doctors at Safdarjung Hospital did not spare any effort to save him in view of his critical condition, but the nature of his injuries was such that he could not be saved
 dow athani ne kaha, aisi choton vaale atyant gambhir marijon ko bhi isiu main bhartee kiya jaataa he or unamem se kai batch jate hai
 This was a very serious matter
 tippaniyan He said that the doctors, nurses and para-medical staff of Safdarjung Hospital worked really hard
 iskaa pratifal bhi mila or 16 disambar kii raat ko gambhir rup se ghayal avasthaa main yahaan laane ke baad vah kam se kam 12 din tak jivit rah saki
 His condition started deteriorating from the fourth day
 tisare oparation ke baad vah bilkul nahin ubar pai
 His level of consciousness was also reduced
 dow athani ne kaha ki usne halaat se muqabla karne or jeene kaa iraadaa jaahir kiya tha
 Most of his conversations were with his mother
 shuruaati teen din ke baad aisa lagane laga tha ki vah thik ho jaaegi
 Dr
 Mehta said, his condition had deteriorated while leaving Safdarjung Hospital
 use bahut buree tarah jakhmi kiya gaya tha
 No part of his intestine was in good condition
 peedit ko singapore ke aspataal main kyon bheja gaya
 To this, Dr
 Mehta said, "the hospital there is one of the best hospitals in this part of the world and i have had many conversations with the doctors there
 maine vahaan kii suvidhaayen or upkaran khud dekhe hai
 Superintendent of Safdarjung Hospital, Dr
 BD Athani, said that it is not the time to argue whether the decision to send the victim to Singapore was on political grounds or medically
 unhone kaha, ekmaatr or sirf ekmaatr iraadaa har surat main uski jaan bachaane kaa tha
 The whole nation was praying for her and everyone hoped that she would recover
 ham ummid nahin tyaag sakate the
 We wanted to save his life
 medanta medicity hospital ke chikitsa visheshgy dow yatin mehta ne kaha ki vah peedit ko singapore bhejne ke faisle kii aalochana se aashcharyachakit hai
 In response to the criticisms, Dr
 Mehta said, "often doctors criticize the decisions of other doctors and this is not true
" unhone kaha ki marij singapore ke aspataal main 48 ghante jivit rahi or yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki use vahaan nahin bheja janaa chahie tha
 Dr Mehta said, secondly, there is no comparison between government hospitals in India and Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore
 main doctoron kii kushalta ke bare main nahin, balki buniyadi suvidhaon ke bare main baat kar rahaa hum
 We should know this
 dow athani ne kaha ki peedit kii aant or anya angon main atyant gambhir chotein thim
