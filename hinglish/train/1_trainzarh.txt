 The first challenge before them will be to give half the population of the country i
e
 women their rights
 jo duniya main sabase kadi paabandiyaan jhel rahi hai
 In the Asian Games held last year, the Saudi Arabian government did not put a single female player in its team, saying that they did not have the ability to participate in the competition
 mahilaon ko doum darje kaa samajhane ke maamle main saudi arab asia hi nahin, duniya main badnaam he
 a look at the strange restrictions imposed on women there
 pati kii ijaajat ke bina bank acount nahindesh ke kisi bhi bank main mahilaon ke bank acount unke pati kii ijaajat ke baad hi khole jate hai
 It is forbidden for unmarried women
 kattarpathiyon kaa maananaa he ki akeli mahila ke paas paisa hoga, to vah gunaah karegi

 purush rishtedaar ke bina kahin aa ja nahin saktisaudi arab main mahila yadi ghar se baahar nikal rahi he, to uske saath ek meharam (purush rishtedaar) kaa hona jaruri he
 Otherwise he will be taken into custody
 vahaan ke kattarpathiyon or dharmik rivaajon main manyata he ki yadi mahila akele kahin jaati he to uske badchalan hone kii sambhaavna rahati he
 This restriction can be understood with an example
 vahaan ek kishori ke saath gangrape hua
 But she was not with her Mehram at that time, so she also got punishment
 court ne rape karne waalon se zyada kode us kishori ko lagavaaye
 3
 driving nahin kar saktinis bare main koi oficial kanoon to nahin he, lekin kattarpanthi rivaaj mahilaon ko driving se rokte hai
 Women who drive are not believed to value social values
 haalanki, 2011 main saudi arab main kuch antarrashtriya sanghathanon ne milakar 'womel2drive' campan chalaaya, jisamen mahilaon se kaha gaya ki ve pichhadi manyataon kii parvaah na karte hue car drive karen or uske photo or video internet par aplod karen
 But this campaign did not get much success

 Can't Vote Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world where women have never voted
 5
 Swimming is not banned in Saudi Arabia
 itnaa hi nahin, ve pool main nahaate purushon kii ore dekh bhi nahin saktin
 6
 shopping ke dauraan kapadon kaa trial nahin le saktinkyonki dharm unhen apane ghar se baahar nirvastr hone kii ijaajat nahin detaa
 But journalist Maureen Dodd of the magazine Vanity Fair argues that this is only because thinking about the nakedness of the woman in the trial room will make it difficult for the men in the shopping store to control
 7
 Can't work on an under garments shop
 In Saudi Arabia, still men work in undergarments shop
 8
 Cannot read un-censored fashion magazine because photos printed in it do not match the beliefs of Islam
 lekin purush unhen pard sakate hai

 barbi nahin kharid saktinsaudi arab main barbi ko yahudee khilonaa bataakar uske kapadon ko gaiyr-islamic qaraar diya gaya he

 ise islamic kanoonon kaa paalan karne ke liye hi banaaya gaya he
 It consists of men with long beards and women security personnel throughout the hijab
 maamuli padtaal ke baad yadi inhone kisi ko gunaahagaar paaya to ve use maukey par hi kode laga dete hai
 Court action takes place later

 The political crisis on Wednesday in the Maldives, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, took a dramatic turn when former President Mohammad Nasheed, who was ousted a year ago, took refuge in the Indian High Commission in Male
 nashid ne yah kadam apane khilaaf ek adaalat se giraftaar warrant jari hone ke baad uthaaya he
 In a statement in New Delhi, expressing concern over the political instability in Maldives, India has said that former Maldives President Mohammad Nasheed is in the Indian High Commission and has sought assistance from India

 India has said that it is in touch with the concerned authorities of Maldives to resolve the situation

 The court issued an arrest warrant after Nasheed did not appear on February 10 in connection with the illegal detention of a judge during his tenure
 warrant jari hone ke baad nashid ne bhartiya ucchayog kii ore rukh kiya
 Nasheed was visiting India and returned to Male on 11 February
 maldive ke vipakshi netaa nashid ne ek twit main kaha he ki apni suraksha or hind mahaasaagar main sthayitv kaa dhyaan rakhte hue maine maldive sthit bhartiya ucchayog main sharan lee he
 According to the Sun
com MV online news portal, a large number of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) workers gathered as soon as the news of Nasheed reached the High Commission
 paryaton mantri ahamed adheeb abdul gafoor ne kaha ki unhen (nashid) vahaan (bhartiya ucchayog) jane kii jarurat hi nahin thi

 However, MDP of Nasheed's political party has strongly condemned the arrest warrant and termed the warrant as well as the charges leveled against him with political intent
 unki party ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki amdipi ne antarrashtriya samudaay se satark rahane or nashid ke liye swatantra evam nishpaksh sunwaayee sunishchit karaane ke liye tatkaal hastkshep kii maang kii he
 The MDP has said that the second hearing of the case was to be held on 10 February

 congress nepiem modike subah laal kile se party par lagaae gaye aaropon ko puri tarah jhootha tehraaya
 Party MP and spokesperson Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi held a conference in the headquarters of All India Congress Committee today and said that the BJP wants to capture the legacy of the freedom movement
 congress ne modi par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki pradhanmantri ucch sanvaidhanik pad par aakar 24 ghante raajnneeti kii baat karte hai or aarope lagaate hai
 Does doing all this to the Prime Minister from Red Fort suit? Is it right to bring Bose and Patel into politics? The Congress surrounded Modi and said that the BJP without heritage is craving to grab the legacy
 bhaajapa jal bin machhlee kii tarah tadapakar baar-baar aazaadee ke andolan kii viraasat ko hathiyaane ke liye koshish karti rahati he
 According to the Congress spokesperson, the bjp-sangh ideology and Netaji's ideology were quite different
 netaji congress adhyaksh rahe
 In the first speech after independence, Nehru recalled Netaji
 nehru ne aaazaad hind fouj ke sadasyon ke liye adaalat main kanoonee ladaai ladi na ki kisi aresas ke sadsy ne
 Singhvi also said in the conference that Netaji had formed the NPC National Planning Committee, which was later made the National Planning Commission
 modi sarkaar ne use dhwast kar niti ayog kaa gathan kiya or ab aadambar kar rahe hai
 Singhvi further said that Congress governments cherished the legacy of Netaji
 netaji ne sampradayik sanghathanon jaise hindu mahasabha or muslim lig ke khilaaf lekh likhe the
 When Netaji was agitating, Savarkar was campaigning that the British army should be admitted
 vahi british sena jo INA se lard rahi thi
 Singhvi denied Modi's allegations and said that Gandhiji was called the Father of the Nation
 jabaki, ab koshish ye ho rahi he ki itihaas main gandhi-bose main yaa nehru-bose main vaimnasy hone kii baat likhe jane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 He also said that the Prime Minister has no knowledge of history
 is shubh avasar par raajnneeti se baj nahin aate balki ulta itihaas padhaate hai
 In fact, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the formation of Azad Hind Fauj government formed by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, the PM under the pretext of Netaji put the Congress governments in the fore
 piem ne kaha ki is desh main ek parivaar ko bada sabit karne ke liye bharat maa ke kai sapooton ko bhulaayaa gaya
 Remembering Netaji's contribution, PM Modi said, "it is sad that many sons of the country, to tell a family big
 
 
 phir wo wo chaahe sardaar patel hon, baba sahib ambedkar hon, yaa phir netaji
 
 
 Attempts were made to forget his contribution to nation building
 "piem ne kaha ki ye unke liye saubhaahgya kii baat he ki desh ke liye subhash babu ne jo kiya, use desh ke saamne rakhane kaa, unke bataaye kadamon par chalane kaa mauka unhen mil rahaa hai, ye unke liye saubhaahgya kii baat he
 The PM said that after independence, if the country had got the leadership of such personalities as Subhash Chandra Bose and Sardar Patel, then the conditions of the country would have been different today
 unhone dukh jataayaa or kaha "aaj main nishchit taur par kah saktaa hum ki swatantra bharat ke baad ke dashakon main agar desh ko subhash babu, sardaar patel jaise vyaktitvon kaa maargdarshan mila hota, bharat ko dekhne ke liye wo videshi chashma nahin hota, to halaat alag hote
 "PM Modi said that because of this, India's tradition, Indian culture, our text books were ignored
 piem ne kaha ki subhash babu ne cambridge ke apane dinon ko yaad karte hue likhaa tha, "ham bharatiyon ko ye sikhaaya jaataa he ki europe, great britain kaa hi bada swaroop he, isliye hamaari aadat europe ko england ke chashme se dekhne kii ho gai he
 "the PM said that he is happy that the country is now following the path shown by Netaji
 unhone kaha ki bharat kaa santulit vikaas, prayek vyakti ko raashtra nirmaan kaa mauka, raashtra kii pragati main unki bhoomika, netaji ke vrihad vijan kaa hissaa thi

 trinmul congress ke varisht netaa taapas roy ne kaha, ‘yadi ek yaa do avasarwaadi vidhayak bijepi main shaamil ho jate he to is baat se koi fark nahin padataa
 Some are opportunistic and some of them were bullied for doing so
 'bataa den buudhvaar ko trinmul vidhayak monirul islam bijepi main shaamil ho gaye
 On Tuesday, two Trinamool mlas and more than 50 councilors joined the BJP
 shaamil hue vidhayakon main bijepi netaa mukul roy ke putr shubhranshu roy bhi shaamil hai
 TMC tweeted in a tweet, 'A suspended Trinamool MLA joined BJP yesterday
 anya vidhayak congress or makapa ke hai
 The number of councilors is six
 unase bhi bandook kaa dar dikhaakar aisa karne ko majaboor kiya gaya
 The Trinamool Congress leadership on Tuesday accused the BJP of being involved in horse-trading which was rejected by the BJP
 bhaajapa netaa mukul roy ne kaha ki aarope puri tarah se bebuniyaad he
 If someone wants to join BJP and fight against tmc's misrule, how can we stop it? tiemasi netaa dal-badal ke bare main baat karne vaale aakhri log hone chahie

 -shant / dant / kuleen / vineet / shuddhveshawah / shuddhachari / supratishthit / shuchirdaksh / subuddhi / ashrami / dhyananishtha / tantra-mantra vishaarad / nigrah-anugrah- guru kii prapti ho jane ke baad prayaas karnaa chahie ki uske disha nirdeshon kaa yatha shakti paalan kiya jaae
 How to worship the Guru - Make the Guru sit on a high pedestal
 - unke charan jal se dhulaaen or ponche
 - Then offer yellow or white flowers at their feet
 - iske baad unhen shwet yaa pile vastra den
 - Offer fruit, sweetmeats as Dakshina
 - guru se apana daayitv sweekaar karne kii prarthana karen
 What to do if you do not have a guru? - Shiva is the master behind every guru
 - atah agar guru na hon to shiv ji ko hi guru maanakar guru poornima kaa parv manaanaa chahie
 - Sri Krishna can also be considered a Guru
 - shrikrishna yaa shiv ji kaa dhyaan camel ke pushp par baithe hue karen
 Mentally offer flowers, confectionery and Dakshina to them
 - swayan ko shishy ke rup main sweekaar karne kii prarthana karen

 akshayakumaarane ek marathi patrika ko apane aurarajesh khannake vishay main vistaar se bataaya
 Akshay said, `` Since childhood, the person whom i had seen only on TV, i will never be associated with him, i will have a very close relationship with him, i had never imagined this
 ’rajesh khanna, jis naam kii charchaa aaj har koi kar rahaa he, film industry kaa pehla superstar or mere sasur, inase aisa naata kabhi ban paaegaa ye maine kabhi sochaa nahin tha
 i had just heard about Rajesh Khanna before i was married to Twinkle, although the stars of my generation knew as much about Rajesh Khanna as i could, but only after we got married could i truly be a superstar Could see closely
 shaadi ke baad hi unke bare main choti badi baaten main samaj sakaa
 Their habits, their faults, their moody moods, their rebellion towards their daughters, i have seen all these things very closely
 mujhe lagata he ki tanhai or superstaradam inkaa aapas main bada kareebi rishta he
 i still remember Dimple ji always called him Khanna
 pichley kuch maheenon se main lagaataar aashirwad bangale par aayaa jaaya karata tha
 Because of this, i had become used to listening to Khanna
 unke aakhri samay main dimple ji hameshaa unke saath thim
 i am a witness to their conversation
 wo rajesh khanna ko hameshaa khanna aap ye karo, ye mat karo kahati rahati thim
 Twinkle also used to come to meet him many times
 unase milane par wo hameshaa kehete the, ki ab is baar mujhe potee chahie
 His relationship with Twinkle and Rinke was also different from that of a father
 tvinkal ke liye pita kaa matlab humaraaz to aarav ke liye wo ek filmi baton ke vikipedia the
 Even today, if Aarav knows all about the films of that time, it is only because of his maternal grandfather
 aarav ke saath share kii hui kai chizon ke bare main tvinkal ko bhi janaakaari nahin hoti thi
 a maternal grandfather and grandson had a slightly different relationship
 un donon kii baatcheet main kai puraani baaten bhi shaamil thim
 What is the relationship between Nana and Nani were also asked
 ek superstar kaa akelaapan kya hota he ye aarav ko nazar aata tha magar ye samajhane kii uski abhi umr nahin thi, isliye hamane unke saath rishton main jo utaar chadhaav hue hai uske bare main aarav ko nahin bataaya
 Khanna ji did not discuss much about them when they came in the relationship, due to this reason, this question always arose in my mind how to talk to them on some topics
 is shaks ko andar se koi kachot he ye mujhe bhi mahasoos hua tha isiilie kisi na kisi kaaran se kabhi kisi tyohaar par, kabhi berthde par aashirwad par sabko ikattha karnaa party karnaa ye maine shuru kiya
 i had more to do but now the game is over at half back
 khannaji biimaar the tab bhi bahut alert the, meri nai release hui film tvinkal kii tabiyat uske bare main wo hameshaa poochtacha karte rahete the
 When i and Dimple ji are on the same set, how did Dimple ji treat me, he (khanna) always used to ask them
 mujhase bahut baatcheet karte the or baatcheet karte vakt puraani baton me kho jate the
 Whatever may be the subject of the conversation, the conversation always ends with his beloved daughters
 ek baar aise hi baatcheet karte vakt tvinkal naam kaise rakhaa isaki puri kahani unhone bataai, unhone kaha ki unhen khud ko star kahalwanaa bahut acha lagata he
 People used to love me madly, that's why i was always stuck on myself
 mujhe hameshaa ek sitare kii tarah chamakna yani tvinkal hona acha lagata he
 This shining was a big thing for me and because of this i felt that the word Twinkle should always be associated with me
 isi vajah se maine apni pehali beti kaa naam tvinkal rakhaa
 In his last days he used to talk a lot
 bolne kii vajah se wo thak jate the isliye dimple ji hameshaa unhen shant rahane ko kahati thi lekin phir bhi wo apane haav bhav se bolte rahete the
 He talked a lot about his last Ed film
 aar baalki ko kis tarah se shot lene ko kaha isse lekar pakup hone tak har chiz ke bare main unhone ji bhar baaten kii
 His enthusiasm always amazed me
 mrityu nazaron ke saamne hokar bhi unhen dar kaise nahin lagata, ye sawaal mere jehan main hameshaa rahata
 He died last month when rumors spread that he came to the gallery himself, Dimple was with him and we were both

 In the new sports bike, the Center of Gravity has been increased from 3 to 4 inches

 This is the reason that the person sitting on the height after the accident jumps and falls away

 The most interesting thing is that the design of the bike is approved by the government, but the biggest question is how the government gave the approval of these sports bikes without safety handles? If every bike in the Motor Vehicle Act has Safety Guard Mandatory then how did these safety handles disappear
 kuch saal pehle jabalpur hoicourt or mumbai hoicourt ne bataa diya tha ki us motorcycle kaa registration nahin hoga jisamen said guard or sefti guard remov kar diya gaya ho par isi saal ek maheene pehle hi supreme court ne guideline jari kii or final kiya ki sefti guard or handle mast kisi bhi bike main factory and par hi lagane chahie
 In such a situation, the government passing the design is responsible for the death of sport bike enthusiasts or the manufacturer or those who died in the accident

 The Samajwadi Party was far ahead in Parliament in raising this issue
 sarkaar ne jati janaganana kaa aashwaasan bhi diya tha
 Are you satisfied with its condition now? sarkaar ne jati janaganana ke saath bahut galat kiya
 There was a consensus in the Parliament on this issue
 ek bhi party iske khilaaf nahin thi
 Everyone supported pradhanmantri ne sansad main aashwaasan diya ki jati janaganana karaayenge
 But it's been so long and nothing is happening

 When will the Lok Sabha elections be held? aapkaa kya akalan he? sarkaar kab tak chalegi

 In the Assembly, there is some sadness and discomfort about the candidates
 loksabhaa main rashtriya mudde honge or is baar un sabhi kshetron main safal honge
 Question: If bjp's seats in Lok Sabha remain low and there is no consensus on Modi's name, then what is Dr
 raman vikalp ho sakate hai?main nahin samajhataa ki waisi paristhiti banegi
 BJP will win with a good majority and the country will not need to find an alternative somewhere

 haalanki, is yojana kaa ulanghan karne par shuukravaar kii tulana main shanivaar ko kuch zyada logon par jurmaana laga
 The effect of this restriction on driving private cars is not visible at the moment, as no reduction in pollution levels has been recorded due to the average air quality being 'very poor'
 tippaniyan To take stock of the situation, Delhi Transport Minister Gopal Rai traveled in the bus and spoke to the volunteers who have been given the responsibility of handing the rose flowers to those who violate the rule

 The expenses of the staff of sexy Bipasha Basu, who are often in the discussion about their styling expenses, are currently causing trouble to the makers of 'creator 3D'
 haalanki bipasha ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki bipasha ne hameshaa apni staff kaa khyaal rakhaa he, so is baar yah koi nai baat nahin he
 It is worth noting that Bipasha takes great care of her styling and makeup not only during the shooting but also during the film promotions
 pramotion ke dauraan jahaan unki stylist kaa kharchaa 65,000 se 70,000 rupee hote hai vahiin bipasha ke hair or mechap kaa kharch lagbhag 20,000 ru
 Comes
 iske alaava boy or driver kaa kharchaa alag
 It may be expenses for the people but Bipasha believes that it is her right
 bipasha kaa kahana he, ‘yah koi nai baat nahin he
 Actually the fees of the staff of the cast are a part of the film contract and they are given the same amount on which the producers have already agreed
 aise main ise atirikt kharch kahana saraasar bemaani baat he
 Also, i do not understand why it is being considered such an exception
 The staff of every artist is charged for their work, whether film shoots or film promotions
 ’maje kii baat yah he ki is masale par nirmaataa bhushan kumaar bhi apni actress bipasha se puri tarah sahamat hai
 He says, 'bipasha has not charged any additional amount for the film promotion from us, so why be so upset about it? According to the agreement that we have signed, we will bear the expenses of their staff during the shooting and not only during the film promotion
 ’yah baat kaabile tarif he ki bipasha basu madhyamvargeey pareshaaniyon se naa sirf rou-ba-rou hai, balki apane madhyamvargeey staff ke haq ke liye ladanaa bhi jaanati hai
 Bipasha is set to compete in her next and India's first creator film 'creator 3D'
 is film main unke saath hai pakistani actor imran abbaas tathaa mukul dev
 'creator 3D' will be released on 12 September
 dilli sarkaar alji awaas ke pratikshalay main dharnarat he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, Ministers Gopalrai and Satyendar Jain are adamant on meeting LG
 or alji bhi kam hathi nahin
 Manish Sisodia is on an indefinite hunger strike
 itnaa hi nahin unhone ne yah bhi chetaya he ki agar alji ne unki maange nahin suni to ve jal bhi tyaag denge
 However, the fight between the AAP government of Delhi and the representative of the Center LG is not new news
 is jang kii shuruyaat or dilli main aap sarkaar kii neenv ek saath hi padi, agar ye kahen to bilkul thik hoga
 But this time there is a smell of electoral khichdi from the middle of the battle
 jang main vipakshi dalon kii jubaani nurakushti yun hi nahin
 Tejashwi Yadav of RJD, Akhilesh Yadav of SP, Sitaram Yechury of CP (M), leader of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and state Chief Minister Hemant Soren say the sharp tweets attacking BJP
 agar yah kahen vipaksh ke twits ke nihitarth dilli kii jang par nigahen or chunaavon par nishaanaa sadhana he to galat nahin hoga
 The CPI (marxist) leader and Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan even wrote a letter to the PM
 arvind kejariwal ko is jang se dilli ke liye kuch milegaa isamen andeh he lekin bhaajapa ke virdohi dalon kii sahanubhuti jarur mil gai
 On the other hand, Karnataka, after Kairana, once again saw opposition unity
 haa, yah jarur he ki is baar chunaav main bhaajapa ko patkhni dene ke liye ye dal lamaband nahin hue balki centre kii bhaajapa sarkaar ko loktantr ko lahooluhaan karne karne vaale krur tanashaah ke rup main main sthapit karne ke liye twitor par ikattha hue
 Elections in three states are to be held again after a few months
 aise main centre sarkaar kii krur chhavi chunaavon main prachaar ke hathiyaar ke taur par aaraam istemaal kar bhaajapa ko nuksaan pahunchaaya ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, the AAP government confined to Delhi can also succeed in giving itself a strong place in the grand alliance on the pretext of this war
 kyonki vaise to 'aap' kii gathbandhan main koi khaas jagah nahin thi
 But to tell the story of the brutality of the Center on the government elected by the people during the recent war elections will be presented as a unique example, do not let it break
 to dilli sarkaar or alji kii jang main vipaksh kaa kudana keval kejariwal ke prati sahanubhuti dikhaanaa nahin he
 During the elections, the grand alliance will present the BJP, which is allegedly tearing democracy, as a misdemeanor in public
 duusari taraf kejariwal shaayad acchhee tarah se jaanate hai ki unki maang puri nahin hogi lekin is 'hath' ke bahaane gathbandhan main unki saakh jarur jamegi or chunavi makasad bhi sadhegaa
 Overall, Arvind Kejriwal and the opposition are busy cooking the 2019 election khichdi on the pretext of this dharna

 ek ore vinay katiyaar, tarun vijay, prabhaat jha, em
 Nearly all BJP leaders including Venkaiah Naidu and Ravi Shankar Prasad were quite agitated
 unamem se kuch netaa to sadan kii kaarywahi main baadha daalate hue lagaataar narebaaji bhi kar rahe the
 But on the other hand, Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley was sitting silent
 unke chehre par kathorta ke bhav saaf jhalak rahe the
 Jaitley is among those who were not in favor of raising the Ram temple issue before the 2014 elections
 lekin party main zyaadaatar duusare logon kii tarah ve bhi khulkar is baat kaa virodh nahin kar paae
 In fact, when he was asked a question about this, his response was very sharp and resentful, "by banning it, they have brought the issue back to the center
 uttar pradesh kii sarkaar agar chaahati to ise aasaani se taala ja saktaa tha
 This trip was approved by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 sangh kaa vishwaas he ki hindutv par waapas lautne se bijepi ko phayda hoga
 But the BJP did not like it
 party adhyaksh rajnath singh kaa kahana he ki unhen viechpi kii yojana ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 However, now that the parikrama has failed completely, it is almost certain that the Sangh Parivar is going to crack
 churaasi kosi parikrama ke mudde ne na sirf sangh ke bheetar praveen togdipha or ashok singhl ke bich ke takaraav ko ujagar kar diya he, balki isse bijepi or aresas ke bich badhata matbhed bhi saamne aa gaya he
 If the purpose of this yatra was to polarize the votes in its favor in electorally important Uttar Pradesh, then it seems like the trick has backfired
 samaajawaadee party (sapa) ne unki is chaal ko apane paksh main kar liya kyonki usne ise bijepi kii maahaul bigaadpee kii koshish ke taur par pesh kiya
 The VHP did not receive much support from the local public in Ayodhya
 yahaan tak ki sadhu-santon ko bhi yah yojana pasand nahin ai
 Due to the stringent security arrangements taken by the SP government, a handful of devotees, who were willing to join the yatra, could not reach the Makhoda Dam, 20 km from Ayodhya
 isi jagah se 25 agast ko yatra shuru hone vaali thi
 a day before this, security was tightened and Uttar Pradesh Police arrested 500 VHP activists including Togadia and Singhal
 yatra taany-taany fiss ho gai
 The fact is that the Home Ministry in Delhi was also worried that the VHP people could cause trouble elsewhere, but that did not happen
 ram janmabhumi andolan se jude sadhu-santon ne bhi is yatra ke prati zyada utsaah nahin dikhaaya
 Mahant Nritya Gopal Das of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas did not issue any appeal about the parikrama
 har saal parikrama kaa aayojan karne vaali saadhuon kii samiti ke pramukh mahant gaya das ne india today ko bataaya ki yah parikrama hindu calendar ke anusaar caitra ke maheene main kii jaati he
 The chief priest of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple, Acharya Satyendra Das, said that the parikrama had already been completed between April 25 and May 15
 unhone kaha, “viechpi kii yatra nishchit hi rajnatik thi or usase ayodhya kaa maahaul bighad saktaa tha
 “even the general public opinion in Ayodhya was not in favor of giving a political color to the Ram temple issue
 logon main koi utsaah nahin dikhaa
 Mahant Ram Das of Nirmohi Akhara alleges that the vhp's motive was purely political and wanted to create an atmosphere before Gujarat Chief Minister and bjp's election campaign chief Narendra Modi entered Ayodhya
 mahant kii baat sahi bhi lagati he
 Sources in the BJP say that the yatra was flagged off by bjp's in-charge Amit Shah in Uttar Pradesh
 party main laalkrishna adwani, jetali, sushamaa swaraj or anant kumaar samet bahut se varisht netaa is yatra ke paksh main nahin the
 Says a party leader, "on one hand, the party is talking about Mission 272+, targeting young voters who vote for the first time through social media and on the other side they want to raise the issue of Ram temple
 yah dohari niti kaamyaab nahin hone vaali he
 "they know that the Ram temple issue in a state like Uttar Pradesh may still have some merit and it may still work, but it has to be taken up properly
" sapa ko ulate is yatra se kuch phayda hi hua
 Not only did she manage to polarize, but she also showed that the sentiments of the people were not in favor of reviving the Hindutva agenda
 congress main zyaadaatar logon kaa maananaa he ki uttar pradesh main dhruvikaran hoga-parikrama par nahin, balki modi par
 BJP also seems to have learned a lesson from this
 party ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, “is tarah kii parikrama yojit karne kaa koi phayda nahin he
 If polarization is the only objective, then there is only one way to do it
 iske liye modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya janaa chahie or unhen uttar pradesh se chunaav maidan main utaarna chahie

 In response to a rape charge leveled by a nun of the famous Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church in Kottayam, Kerala, a bishop has said that the complainant has been charged with revenge for taking disciplinary action against the nun
 aaropee bishap ne bhi police main nan ke khilaaf cese darj karvaa diya he
 These bishops work on behalf of the Malankara Church in Jalandhar, Punjab
 nan ne apni shikaayat main kaha he ki aaropee bishap ne kerala main posting ke dauraan 2014 se 2016 ke bich apane guest house main uskaa yon shoshan kiya
 The nun alleges that the bishop raped her 13 times during this time
 vahiin kottayam police kaa kahana he ki aaropee bishap ne nan se pehle hi shikaayat darj karai thi
 In his complaint, the accused Bishop had told the police that the complainant nun was threatening him that he would file a case of sexual abuse against him
 bataa den ki sabase pehle nan ke pati ne carch ko chitthee likhakar aath padariyon ke khilaaf shikaayat kii thi, haalanki usne sirf paanch padariyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii thi
 In her complaint, the victim's husband has written that a pastor sexually abused his wife 380 times
 shikaayat milane ke baad carch kii varking kamity ke sadsy or carch ke pradhan padri emo jon ne somvaar ko paanchon aaropee padariyon ko chuttee par bhej diya
 One of the accused clergymen was associated with the branch working for the Church's Delhi jurisdiction
 paanchon padariyon kii pahchaan bhi saamne aa gai he
 The names of Father Jijo j Abraham, Father Job Mathew, Father Johnson v Mathew, George j of Father Jesse and Father Abraham Varghese are appearing among the priests suspended from the church on charges of sexual exploitation
 peedita ke pati ne carch ko likhi shikayati chitthee main bataaya he ki uski patni ne aaropee padariyon main se ek ke samaksh kuch kanfeshan kiya tha, jise carch ke niyamon ke mutabik padri ko sirf khud tak simit rakhana chahie tha
 But the accused pastor started blackmailing him only through a confession made by his wife
 peedita ke pati or carch ke ek adhikari ke bich isi ghatana ko lekar huibaatcheet kaa ek audio clipabhi soshal media par viral hua he
 In this audio clip, the victim can be heard telling the husband that his wife was sexually abused by a church pastor before marriage
 baad main peedita ne jab vivaah se pehle rahe prem sambandhon ko lekar kanfeshan kiya to kanfeshan sunne vaale padri ne bhi uskaa yon shoshan kiya
 For this, the pastor threatened his wife that he would tell her husband everything about it
 itnaa hi nahin is padri ne kuch tasveeron ke jariye peedita ko blackmel kar use duusare padri ko saunp diya
 And another pastor also sexually abused his wife
 peedita ke pati kaa kahana he ki carch se jude kuch nami-giraami logon ne us parashikayat waapas lene kaa dabaavbanaya
 However, instead of informing the police on the victim's complaint, Father John has set up a panel inside the church to investigate the allegations on the five priests
 fadar jon kaa kahana he ki is sambandh main police se shikaayat karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Father John told that at different stages of age, the victim has had a love affair with the three priests of the church
 bhartiya mul kii bijness vuman miki agarwal par unheen kii ek amploi ne yon shoshan kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Let me tell you that Mickey currently lives in the US and is known for launching period free underwear (which does not require pads)
 miki agarwal kii company Thinx kii eks amploi chelsi libo ne new york ke human ritis kamishan ke paas unke khilaaf apni shikaayat darj karwaai he
 Chelsea Lebow has been the head of the Public Relations Department at the company
 14 saal kii ladki ko bandhak bana 1000 logon se banwaaya shaareerik sambandhfemail kalig ne kaha- miki ne mujhe galat tareeke se chuachelsi ne apni shikaayat main kaha he ki miki ne kai baar unako galat tareeke se tach kiya he
 Chelsea reports that Mickey touched her breasts without her permission and asked her to show nipple piercing as well
 yahi nahin chelsi ne aarope lagaaya ki offis kii ek meeting main miki ne saream unke bare main unke body part ke bare main baat kii
 On which he faced embarrassment
 sex racket kaa bhandaphod, ghar se mila aapattijanak samanchelsi dwaara di gai shikaayat main kaha gaya he ki is tarah miki duusari femail amplise ke aage khud ko powerful dikhaanaa chaahati thim
 Video conferencing Chelsea used to take off clothes and also accused Mickey that she used to hold office meetings deliberately through video conferencing
 is dauraan vah sabhi ke saamne yaa to kapade utaar kar bed par letati thim yaa phir kapade badalati thim
 Mickey also alleges that she used to force a gay employee to get hot
 chelsi kii maane to miki ke vyavhaar ke bare main company main shikaayat karne par unako baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 Body does business, wife of this police officer, will know the reason, Dangakya says, Mickey these allegations Paramiki Agarwal has denied saying anything on these allegations
 haalanki apni statement unhone ek post main di he
 In this, Mickey Agarwal has said - i say this clearly that i am one of those who move away from the common tasks
 lekin kisi ke sammaan ko maine kabhi thes nahin pahunchaai he
 Spokespersons of Thinx, a company serious about the issue, say they are serious about the issue
 lekin company ko is maamle main koi kanoonee shikaayat nahin mili he
 After his departure from the company, this complaint came in front of us and in the subsequent investigation it came to light that there is no legal basis for it
 vaise ye aarope tab saamne aae hai jab miki agarwal ne Thinx kii CEO kii post se istipha de diya
 Hero Pain
 hamaare haathon kaa china se rishta isi kalam se bana tha
 Jayanto Karmakar saw this pen near him
 kalam kii neeb ko apni ungaliyon se baraabar jakad kar wo aise likhata tha, jaise likhaawat itaraa rahi ho
 Very clean and beautiful handwriting just like the houses on Delhi's Aruna Asaf Ali Marg
 utani hi betaratib or karaab likhaawat meri jaise dakshin dilli kii sanjay colony ke bedab or badrang makaan
 Me and Jayanto Karmakar lived together for six years of school
 dosti kii koi taarikh nahin hoti or uskaa koi paimaana nahin hota, magar class main kabhi saath-saath, to kabhi aage-peeche baithne se ek rishta to ban hi gaya tha
 Jayanto never came second
 hameshaa first aata tha
 i never used to come first
 kisi tarah ratta markar paas kar jaataa tha
 At times, there is also experience of failing in some subjects
 mujhe lagata tha ki jayanto kii likhaawat main koi jaadu he, jisase wo first aata he
 That magic is hero pain
 china kii kalam
 i also bought that pen
 gaur karne laga ki jayanto neeb ko kaise pakadta he, kaise likhata he
 Sometimes he would write like that, then he would be happy
 jayanto karmakar apni copy kisi ko nahin detaa tha
 School toppers do not give their copy to anyone
 magar kabhi-kabhi wo apni copy mujhe de detaa tha
 Taking home, he used to watch very carefully how his writing is so much better
 ek chahat to ban hi gai ki uske jaisaa likhnaa he
 i write poorly, but when the mood is good, i start writing like Jayanto
 jab bhi saafe likhata hum, jayanto yaad aa jaataa he
 Everything has been remembered again
 uske saath cycle se skool janaa or baaten karte hue lautnaa
 Why does he sometimes say that when Gandhi and Rajendra Prasad did so much, why can't we
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki use kuch karne kaa mauka mila yaa nahin yaa wo in baton ko bhul gaya, lekin 'gandhi' film kii shooting vaali bas ko sadakat ashram ke paas dekh ham bahut der tak gandhi ke bare main baat karte rahe
 Then i knew so much about Gandhi that he had liberated the country
 tab use bhi bahut pataa nahin rahaa hoga, lekin gandhi ke bare main baaten karne ke liye pataa hona, tab bhi bahut zaruri nahin tha or aaj bhi nahin he
 On the way to school, Jayanto used to meet in front of his elder brother's shop
 patna ke dinon main bahut doston ke ghar jane kaa mauka nahin mila
 We always used to meet at crossroads or streets
 behad saadhaaran str kii sone-chaandi kii dukaan thi jayanto kii
 i can still reach that shop at once
 jayanto meri zindagi main vidhyaarthee jivan kii kamazoriyon kii dawa banakar aayaa
 i held her back and did not leave
 acchhee tarah yaad he
 We started reading together several times
 ek topper kaa ek kamazor chaatr ke saath milakar padhanaa kam badi baat nahin thi
 It was during the same time that i first brought up the name of self-confidence
 saath padhane kii jagah uski chat thi
 Nothing is achieved in student life without spiritual practice
 yah hamane jayanto se hi siikhaa
 He had built a hut on the roof of his house
 blike board tanga hota tha, jahaan wo ganit ke sawaalon kaa khadey hokar abhyaas karata tha, taaki neend main samay na barbaad ho jaae
 i also started standing in my house to read or say that i could not sleep
 mujhe lagane laga ki kuch bhi divine nahin he
 Have to practice continuously
 abhyaas karte rahane kii aadat mujhe jayanto se pad gai
 We do not know when we are learning from whom
 kab kiske prabhaav main aa rahe hote hai or wo prabhaav hamen zindagi main kahaan le jane vaala hota he
 You are nothing alone in life
 aapkaa nirmaan hameshaa saamaajik hota he
 i have not written all this to remember Jayanto Karmakar
 balki isliye likhaa he ki wo hero pen aaj bhi mere paas he
 That ink too, with which i saw Jayanto writing for the first time
 jayanto ne hi bataaya tha ki chellpark kii tarakwaiz rang kii syaahi acchhee lagati he
 i wrote with the same ink from school to my MA days
 magar us syaahi se likhnaa us din chhod diya, jab kisi naukari ke dauraan sampadak ke chelon ne syaahi par unka copirite ghoshit kar diya
 i could not say that we and Jayanto have been writing for fifteen years with this ink
 is bich ham ek-duusare se kaaphi dur ho gaye
 Did not know who is where
 wo ejineering kii padhai karne kahin chalaa gaya or vahaan se apni yatra par
 Seven-eight years ago, when i met old friends in Delhi, the first thing i heard was that Jayanto is not in this world
 kaath maar gaya tha
 Well Jayanto was discovered
 balki usee kaa kahin se phone aa gaya tha ki tum ye sab tivi main khud se kaise bol lete ho
 Someone gives it by writing or by himself
 ham donon hansane lage
 He knew what a rude student i was
 main bas isi baat se khush tha ki jayanto kahin nahin gaya he
 It is here us din raajnneeti ko lekar tikhi bahes bhi ho gai thi
 It is such a good thing that we always see school friends through the glasses of school days
 aise hi dekhnaa bhi chahie
 Sometimes there were talks, but we could not come face-to-face together like in bicycle days
 mumbai jane kaa mauka hi nahin mila
 Whenever he saw the showroom of his company in Delhi, he would surely leave once
 sirf mahasoos karne ke liye ki jayanto is company main kaam karata he
 i had to be like Jayanto Karmakar
 main hameshaa usee kii tarah banataa rahaa
 Doing everything in a timely manner
 ban nahin paaya wo alag baat he
 Rather, no Jayanto Karmakar was made in our school
 bananaa to sab chaahate the
 Wanted to get ahead of him as well
 mere paas jayanto se churaayaa uskaa anushaasan or abhyaas aaj bhi he
 i am writing all this today because today my hero is gone
 balki wo is duniya se do din pehle hi chalaa gaya he
 i got up straight and went to the room where Hero Pen is still kept
 tees saal se yah kalam mere paas he
 Jayanto Karmakar is with me
 apane computer ke kii-board ke saamne hero pen rakhkar ye sab likh rahaa hum
 i do not know today why the ink is seeping from the lime of the pen
 kuch likhane ke liye, kuch vaisaa hi likhane ke liye jaisaa jayanto likhata tha
 The government said on Thursday, a day after global rating agency Fitch reduced the credit scenario of 12 Indian financial institutions, that there was no reason for such action
 vittiya sevaaon ke sachiv dike mittal ne asocham ke ek sammelan ke avasar par kaha ‘‘hamen koi vajah najar nahin aati ki bhartiya bainkon kii reating kyon ghatai jaae
 There is no reason for rating agencies to lose credibility
 ’’ unhone kaha ki 2011-12 ke sabhi bainkon ke nattejey aae or chetavanee bhar bhi aisa koi sanket nahin he
 Fitch reduced the future credit scenario of 12 financial agencies, including SBI, ICICI Bank, Punjab National Bank, from stable to negative
 isse kuch dinon pehle reating agency ne bharat ke vittiya saakh paridrishy ko bhi sthir se ghataakar nakaaratmak kar diya tha
 The comments reating agenciyon ke bharat athwa bhartiya vittiya sansthaanon ke bare main drushtikon main sanshodhan se videsh se rin milanaa manhagaa ho saktaa he
 The first bank to be affected by this would be SBI, which recently announced plans to raise $ 2 billion from the overseas market
 bharat kii jin vittiya sansthaanon or bainkon kii reating paridrishya ko kam kiya gaya he unamem chah saarvajanik kshetra ke upkram hai jabaki do nijee kshetra ke bank hai

 niryaat aayaat bank, hadako, idiefasi or bhartiya rail vitt nigam bhi isse prabhavit honge
 Financial Services Secretary DK Mittal said on the sidelines of an ASSOCHAM conference, "we don't see any reason why the ratings of Indian banks should be reduced
" reating agenciyon dwaara saakh ghataane kii koi vajah nahin he
 He said that the results of all the banks in 2011-12 came and there is no such indication even on the alert
 fich ne esbiai, isiaisiai bank, punjab naishanal bank samet 12 vittiya agenciyon ke bhavishya ke saakh paridrishy ko sthir se ghataakar nakaaratmak kar diya
 a few days earlier, the rating agency also reduced India's financial credit scenario to negative from stable
 tippaniyan The amendment in the rating agencies' view of India or Indian financial institutions may make it expensive to get loans from abroad
 isse sabase pehle prabhavit hone vaala bank esbiai hoga jisane haal hi main videshi bazaar se do arab dollars jutaney kii yojana kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Among India's financial institutions and banks whose rating scenario has been reduced, six are psus and two are private sector banks

 ) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has said that his support for the presidential election is to bjp's proposed Ramnath Kovind
 vajah yah he ki wo bihar ke rajyapal hai or dalit hai
 If Kovind wins, then for the first time a Dalit President from North India will become
 nitish isi tark ke aadhaar par guuruuvaar ko vipakshi dalon kii baithak main bhi shaamil nahin hue
 But the weak opposition in numbers has played a strong bet
 congress kii netaa or loksabhaa kii adhyaksh raheen mira kumaar ko vipakshi dalon ne sarvasammati se apana raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya he
 With this, both the names have now become Dalits in the presidential election
 or isiilie dalit ko samarthan kaa tark ab kisi ek ke paale kaa turup nahin rah gaya he
 Presidential election: Meera Kumar to be UPA candidate, nda's Kovind, Congress has actually cut the bjp's trump with the same clash
 isliye is chunaav main ab dalit se zyaada ahm factor bhaajapa banaam vipaksh ho gaya he or yaheen par haar ke baad bhi vipakshi ekajutata kii ladaai main congress jitati nazar aa rahi he
 Statistics say that BJP candidate Kovind ji cannot be stopped from winning
 isiilie shuukravaar ko bhaajapa ke sheersh netaaon or mukhyamantriyon kaa jambo samooh ramnath kovind kaa namakan karaane dilli pahunch rahaa he
 But the breaking and sinking opposition has succeeded in making it a battle of BJP vs Opposition
 mushkil main nitishamira kumaar dalit hone ke saath-saath mahila bhi hai
 Mayawati, who had given an indication of consent to Kovind's name, has said that she will be supported by Meera Kumar
 lalu prasad ne mira kumaar ke naam kaa samarthan karte hue yah tak kah diya ki nitish kumaar agar ab bhi kovind kaa samarthan karte hai to yah aitihaasik bhul hogi
 It would be a historical mistake to support Lalu's Nitish, supporting kovind
he also said that Meera Kumar is the daughter of Bihar and if citing personal support, go with Nitish Kovind then understand that politics is based on ideology, not personal it occurs
 vipaksh kii baithak main 17 raajnneetik dal maujuud the or sabhi ne mira kumaar par sahmati jataai
 It was not just Nitish
 nitish ke liye mushkil yah he ki agar wo ab bhi bhaajapa pratyaashee ke saath jate hai to vipakshi dalon ke bich alag-thalag pad jaaenge
 The same is true for Mulayam Singh Yadav, who appeared soft in the name of Kovind
 kovind bihar ke rajyapal hai lekin unki zamin upi he
 Meera Kumar belongs to Bihar
 unhone vahaan raajnneeti kii he
 Not supporting Meera Kumar for Nitish will also make it difficult for him in Bihar
 vipaksh kaa doosraa bada daanv yah he ki agar koi dal kovind kii jeet tay hone kaa tark degaa to use vipaksh kahegaa ki aisi sthiti main to sansad main sankhya kam hone ke kaaran virodh hi band kar dena chahie
 For opposition parties, Kovind's becoming a Dalit can no longer be a natural reason for support
 unhen yah bhi sochna padegaa ki agar aaj wo vipaksh ke saath nahin hai to phir vipaksh unke saath khadaa ho yaa nahin
 This question is very difficult for Nitish
 mumbai hamale kaa gunaahagaar hafiz said pakistan main lagaataar khuleam gum rahaa he
 By not taking him into custody again, the evil face of Pakistan has once again come in front of the world
 uski najarbandi ke dauraan se hi pakistan kii niyat kaa pataa chal gaya tha ki usne america ke dabaav main aakar khoonkhaar aatanki hafiz said ko najarband kiya he or jald hi usko bina sajaa dilaae reeha kar degaa
 The release of terrorist Hafiz was already scheduled
 najarbandi ke fouran baad hafiz said kaa ek video bhi saamne aayaa tha, jisamen vah kah rahaa tha ki pakistan sarkaar ne bahari dabaav main use giraftaar kiya he
 Terrorist Hafiz had said that there has been a new friendship between Donald Trump and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and we have been kept under house arrest under American pressure at the behest of Modi
 america ne aatanki hafiz ke sir par ek karod dollar kaa inaam bhi ghoshit kar rakhaa tha
 It is believed that now as soon as the pressure of US came down, Pakistan showed its color and ended the detention of Hafiz Saeed
 haal hi main america kii ore aatankiyon kii jo suchi saunpi gai thi, usamen bhi hafiz kaa naam nahin tha
 This boosted Pakistan's morale and cleared the way for Hafiz's release
 haalanki pakistan sarkaar ne duniya kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne ke liye hafiz kii najarbandi se rihaai ke baad kaha tha ki vah aatanki hafiz ko kisi duusare maamle main hiraasat main legi
 At present, Pakistan's intention of arresting or arresting Hafiz is not visible
 lihaaja ab vah pakistan main lagaataar gum rahaa he
 It has been so long since the release of Hafiz Saeed, but so far the Government of Pakistan has not taken any step to re-arrest or detain him
 vahiin, hafiz said pakistan kii raajnneeti main entry karne ke liye betaab he
 Therefore, it has petitioned the United Nations to remove its name from the list of global terrorists
 haalanki kukhyatatanki hafiz saidane aatankwaad kii duniya jo bade-bade kaale karname kiye hai, wo uski is pahchaan ko kabhi mitane nahin denge
 So his desire to enter politics cannot be fulfilled
 pakistan main aam chunaav ke liye mahaj ek saal kaa hi vakt bachaa he
 Earlier, Hafiz Saeed has also filed a petition in the United Nations demanding that his name be removed from the list of global terrorists
 iske liye usne pehali baar ek kanoonee form ko hair kiya he
 The intention of Hafiz is to get rid of the word terrorist and get into the politics of Pakistan
 haalanki agar pakistan ne hafiz said ko raajnneeti main laane kii galati kii, to duniya bhar main usko fajihat jhelni padegi
 Hafiz Saeed has been a professor of Arabic language and engineering, but later he majored in engineering of terrorist-generating machinery in Pakistan

 gujarat kii satta se congress 22 saal se baahar he
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has landed in the political battleground of Gujarat to end this exile of power
 congress gujarat ko fatah karne ke liye jatiy sameekaran se lekar har siyaasi aajamaaish karne main juty he
 Looking at the results of the last two assembly elections, it is clear that the graph of Congress is continuously increasing and bjp's is decreasing
 par satta ke singhaasana tak pahunchane ke liye congress ko 92 siton kaa pahaad jaisaa lakshya hasil karnaa he, jo kisi lohe ke chane chabane jaisaa he
 bjp's maximum seats but
 
 
 gujarat main kul 182 vidhansabha site hai
 Talking about the number of assembly seats, the Congress has increased its graph every time after the 2002 elections
 2002 main gujarat dange ke baad hue vidhansabha chunaav main 181 siton par hue chunaav main bijepi ne pranchad bahumat ke saath satta main vaapasi kii
 BJP got 127 seats in 2002 and Congress 50 seats
 bijepi kaa ab tak sabase behatar nateeja bhi yahi rahaa
 Congress's growing graph In the 2007 assembly elections in Gujarat, BJP seats decreased and Congress increased
 2007 main bijepi ko 117, congress ko 59 or anya ko 6 siten milin
 In the 2012 assembly elections, BJP once suffered a setback and lost two seats compared to 2007 and the Congress gained 2 seats
 2012 main bijepi ko 115, congress ko 61 or anya ko 6 siten mili
 In this way, if we look at the results of the last 15 years of the Congress, it is clear that the graph of the Congress has increased continuously
 congress ke paas he aitihaasik jeet kaa recordgujarat main congress ko aakhri baar badi jeet loksabhaa chunaav 1984 or vidhansabha chunaav 1985 main mili thi
 The Congress had won a record 24 out of 26 seats in Gujarat in the Lok Sabha elections, while a record 149 out of 182 assembly seats
 iske baad se congress kaa graph lagaataar girtaa gaya or 1995 main to gujarat kii satta se hi baahar ho gai
 In the last few elections in Gujarat, Congress proved to be nineteen compared to BJP
 lekin bijepi congress ke 1985 ke aakade tak abhi tak pahunch nahin pai he
 The BJP president has set a target of winning 150+ seats this time
 bijepi 15 fisadi se 48 fisadi takgujarat main congress 2001-02 main narendra modi ke aagaman ke baad or kamjor hoti chali gai

 9 fisadi tak pahunch gai he
 Whereas bjp's graph has increased from 15% to 48%
 pichley teen chunaavon main, ye 48-50 fisadi ke bich rahaa he
 The BJP got the highest number of 49 in the 2002 elections
 9 fisadi vot mili hai
 The equation of power will change by five percent of the votes of the Congress in 1990
 7 fisadi vot par aakar simat gai thi
 But taking the data of the last three assembly elections, the graph of Congress has increased continuously
 congress ne apana pradarshan sudhaarte hue 2012 main ise 39 fisadi tak pahunchaaya
 On an average there has been a difference of 10 per cent votes between the BJP and the Congress
 aise main agar bijepi kaa vot 5 fisadi ghatata he or congress kaa badhata he to gujarat kaa siyaasi sameekaran puri tarah se badal jayega
 Because there seems to be a close fight between Congress and BJP
 is baar congress ne jatiy samikarnon ko sadhakar bijepi ko kadi takkar dene kii taiyaari kii he or isliye team modi utani aashwast bhi nahin dikh rahi

 Attorney General KK Venugopal started a debate on behalf of the CBI, accusing him of destroying evidence in the Sarada chit fund scam case
 sunwaayee ke dauraan atorni general ne court main kaha, 'kolkata police ne chhedchhad kiye hue kol data record muhaiyaa karaae
 Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar was headed by the SIT constituted by the West Bengal government to investigate the chit fund scam
 'supreme court ne kaha, 'kolkata police pramukh se jaanch ke liye pesh hone ko kah sakate hai or sibiai kii avmaananaa yachika par notice jari kiya jayega
 Senior advocate AM Singhvi, appearing for Kolkata Police Chief Rajiv Kumar, alleged that the CBI took this step to increase its number
 court ne kolkata police ayukta rajeev kumaar ko sibiai ke saamne pesh hone or karaane or sharada ghotaalaa jaanch main puraa sahyog karne kaa aadesh diya
 With this, the Supreme Court said that no punitive action will be taken against Kolkata Police Chief Rajiv Kumar, including arrest

 On this plea of CBI, CJI Ranjan Gogoi said that you give evidence of tampering of evidence, if evidence is found then we will take such strict action that they will regret it
 
 Significantly, in connection with the Saradha chit fund scam, Rajiv Kumar has also been accused by the CBI that he was summoned several times but he did not cooperate in the investigation
 vahiin, pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee police kamishnar rajeev kumaar ke paksh main khadi dikh rahi hai
 This is the reason that after meeting her on Sunday, Mamta announced the dharna and she has been sitting on dharna for three days

 sachin ne apane is saal main kai uplabdhiyaan hasil kii jismenvishwa kapajitne kaa unka sabase bada sapana bhi puraa hua
 Sachin has won all the records of the cricket world and it seems almost impossible for a new player to achieve these records
 khaas baat yah he ki ‘ricardon ke badshaah’ hone ke baavjood sachin apni saadagi ke liye jane jate hai, khulkar jashn manaane ke liye nahin
 If the master blaster is not busy on the field, he likes to cut his birthday cake with his wife Anjali, both children and other family members
 baharhaal, is saal aisa nahin hone vaala he kyonki unke janmdin ke din hi tii-20 lig main mumbai or hyderabad main muqabla hona he
 The glamor of the T20 League will definitely be seen in the celebration of Sachin's birthday, in which Bollywood superstars and big personalities of corporate houses will wish Tendulkar a happy birthday

 Sachin is on the threshold of scoring 100th century in international cricket and it can be expected that Sachin will also do this feat on the upcoming tour

 His first career tour in 1989 was not good for him and the pace bowler Waqar Younis got the bouncer Tendulkar and started bleeding from his nose but Tendulkar did not panic and he spent the next two decades on all kinds of grounds in the world
 Taught a lot of lessons to yah kram aaj bhi jari he
 Tendulkar scored his first Test century against England at the Old Traffold ground the following year, and the Mumbai cricketer proved his mettle on the Australian tour in 1991–92
 unhone sidney or perth jaisi viketon par shatak jadkar sabko hairaan kar diya
 Almost every batting record, except for Brian Lara's record of most unbeaten 400 runs in Test matches and 501 not out in the first class, is to Sachin's name
 sachin 177 test maichon main 56
 He has scored 14692 runs at an excellent average of 94

 vanade cricket main ekmaatr doharaa shatak jadne kaa karnama bhi sachin ne hi kiya he
 Sachin scored an unbeaten 200 against South Africa in Gwalior
 sachin haalanki keval ipel main hi tii-20 match khelte hue najar aate hai
 Sachin once said, 'the greatest appreciation of his batting came from Sir Donald Bradman himself in 1999 when he (bradman) said that Tendulkar's style of play reminds him of his style
 ’ sachin keval balle se nahin balki gend ke bhi maharathi hai

 film: happy new yearratin 3
 5 Stardirector: Farah Khan Artist: Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan, Sonu Sood, Baman Irani, Jackie Shroff and Vivaan Shahis It cannot be denied that Bollywood copes completely with Hollywood
 lekin kuch baaten hai jo isane shaayad hollywood se nahin sikhi hai
 Thinking above sensible story and person worship
 inhen baton kaa najaara superstars apni har film ke saath pesh karte hai
 They have come to understand that their name goes on in the market, so serve nothing
 isaki jhalak hamen dhooma-3, kik or baing baing main mil chuki hai
 All three films were related to piracy and there was nothing to mind the name of the story
 yahi samajhadaari farah khan ne bhi kii he or shaayad tees maar khan main dakaiti ke jariye jo ve siddh nahin kar saki thim, usee baat kii kasak ko unhone shahrukh ke jariye puri karne kii koshish kii he
 The central theme of the story is, of course, diamond robbery, but it seems like all the time there is a dance competition going on
 farah khan ne shahrukh kii puraani filmon kaa bhi happy new year main kaaphi istemaal kiya he
 The film attempts to spin comedy, action and every spice that makes it worth a look
 agar film kii avadhi 20-25 minute kam hoti to zyada acha rahata
 How much Damsharukh Khan (charlie) in the story has to avenge Jackie Shroff's insult to his father
 vah yah badla uske heere churaakar lenaa chahta he
 For this, they form a team of six people and they plan to steal diamonds on the pretext of participating in the World Dance Championship
 is team main deepika (mohini), abhishek (nandu bhide), sonu (jags), baman (temi) or vivaan (rohan) shaamil hai
 This is how the real-life beaten people steal diamonds starts this way
 kahani bollywood kii har 200-300 karod ru
 Like earning movies that do not need attention
 vaise bhi farah khan tees maar khan ke baad apana jaadui sparsh khoti najar aa rahi hai
 She is seen getting entangled in the web of grandeur
 ve shahrukh khan kaa sahi istemaal film main nahin kar saki hai
 Like Sajid Khan, i would also like to say to Farah Khan that he should take the audience a little bit seriously
 star apilafilm kii sabase badi khaasiyat iske star hai
 Shah Rukh and Deepika duo have given record breaking films like Om Shanti Om and Chennai Express
 donon ishk farmaate achche lagate hai, vaise bhi shahrukh khan to romance ke king hai hi
 Shahrukh Khan's At Packs and Deepika's Lovely Songs are awesome and are enough to draw crowds
 abhishek bachchan, sonu sood, baman irani or vivaan shah ne bhi acha saport kiya he
 Abhishek should focus more on comedy films
 puri team hansaane or time paas karne main safal rahi he
 There is no question of loss if it is Shahrukh's film
 unki marketing stretage or film ko lekar taiyaari itani jabardast hoti he ki ve uski kamai kaa bada hissaa aasaani se nikaal lete hai
 If the producer is himself then what to say
 film kaa bajet lagbhag 150 karod ru
 Is told
 film ko lekar hip kaaphi he
 The songs are also good
 festival sijan bhi he
 Shahrukh has a strong fanbase abroad
 film kamai ke nae record banaaegi koi shubahaa nahin
 But superstars like Shah Rukh should start focusing on the story

 17 oktober tak desh se waapas jayega monsoonajate-jate kuch desh ke kuch hisson ko bhigoegais baar monsoon ne logon ko apana alag cheharaa dikhaaya
 This time the monsoon stopped for about 15 days longer than normal
 yani der tak barish
 It is usually heard that the monsoon will come late
 lekin aisa kai saalon ke baad ho rahaa he jab monsoon der tak ruk rahaa he
 Also, there is a possibility that it will rain again on October 17 due to western disturbances
 mausam kii jaankaree dene vaali sanstha skymet ke anusaar 17 se 20 oktober ke bichmaharashtra, mubani, goa, konkanke ilaakon main phir barish ho sakati he
 Because moist winds coming from the southwest and dry winds coming from the northwest can be found
 isse barish karne vaale badalon ke banane kii puri sambhaavna he
 The weather forecast told what will be the monsoon trend in the next 5 days
 padosi rajyon main zyada barish, banpar paidaavaar bani dilli kii musiibat, badha pradooshan, nasa kaa daawamonsoon ko lekar aamtaur par kya hota he?bhartiya mausam vibhaag ke anusaar aamtaur par monsoon 45 dinon main waapas jaataa he
 That is, it takes time from September 1 to October 15 to leave the southern part of the northern part of India
 lekin is baar der tak rukne vaala monsoon ne desh ke uttari hisse ko 9 oktober ko choda or puure desh ko yah 17 oktober tak chhod degaa
 That is, the monsoon usually took 45 days to leave the country, but this time it took only 9 days
 baadh or monsoon kii barish se 2100 logon kii maut, jaaniye rajyavar aankadeis baar kitne din zyada ruk gaya monsoon?monsoon kii shuruyaat june main hoti he
 By 30 September, the monsoon has to return from the country
 lekin, is baar monsoon zyada din ruk gaya
 Still returning
 do din baad vah puri tarah se waapas laut jayega
 But on the go, it will rain
 yani is saal monsoon apane tay samay se kareeb 15 din zyada desh main rukaa
 Earlier in 1961, the monsoon returned on 1 October
 vahiin, 2007 main bhi monsoon 30 sitambar ko lautaa tha
 This is the first time the monsoon has stopped for so long
 bihar baari padi laaparvaaheeis baar desh main 10 fisadi zyada barish hui heis baar puure desh main saamaanya se 10 pratishat adhik barish hui he
 Although Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and some earlier states have received less than normal rainfall, the overall country average is higher
 zyada barish or jyada din monsoon rukne kaa sabase bada kaaran tha purvi hawaaon kaa lagaataar bane rahanaa
 Due to this the moisture and rain in the air was continuing
 ab hawa main nami kam ho rahi he
 So now the monsoon is returning
