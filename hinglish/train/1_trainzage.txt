 In Hisar, Haryana, a church under construction was torn down and a red flag was waved over it
 sthaneey logon dwaara kii gai is todphod par siem manohar laal khatter ne vidhansabha main jawaab diya
 Khattar said in the assembly on Monday that the church building was allegedly built in an illegal colony and the dispute was the result of a quarrel between the clergy and those who attacked there, while the Vishwa Hindu Parishad defended the demolition
 vihip ne kaha ki mandir kaa nirmaan bharat main nahin hoga to kya vatican city main kiya jayega?khatter ne vidhansabha main ek bayaan main kaha ki carch ke padri subhash chandra ke bayaan ke aadhaar par aropiyon anil godara, dalbir singh, raaj kumaar, kuldeep, satpal, krishna, suresh, dinesh, jogendra, kulvant, sudhir, bijendra, satyanarayan, chotu ram or anya ke khilaaf praathmiki darj kar di gai he

 Reacting to the demolition in Hisar, Jain said, "it was a spontaneous reaction from the local people
" jis jagah carch main todphod hui, vahaan gaanv main yaa carch ke aasapaas koi isai parivaar nahin rahata
 In such a situation, the question is why the church was built in such a place? Will Christian communities allow temple construction in Vatican City? If he gives us this permission, we will give him the option to choose any place in India and we will get the church built there ourselves
 ' jain ne kaha ki carch kaa nirmaan dharm parivartan ke liye kiya gaya tha

 Now 4G is the next stop which will change your world completely
 ab aapako aajtak
 You won't have to wait for your eyelashes to go from one news to another
 kuch is tarah badalegi aapaki duniya
 
 
 What are these 'G' issues? 'G' coming in 2G, 3G and 4G means the generation of mobile technology
 jaiseni peedi puraani peedise tej maani jaati he usee tarah 4G bhi apni puraani peedi kii taknikiyon (3G, 2G, 1G) se zyada tej he
 Both the first generation 1G and 2G in Internet service are connected to analog, while 3G and 4G are the technology of the digital world
 to 4G se kya samajhen?4ji wirelas seva kii chauthi peedi he
 3G technology further improves network facilities with the help of OFDMA (orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)
 4G puri tarah se IP aadhaarit seva hogi
 In this, voice, data and multimedia can be sent and received at the same speed

 4G kii speed 100 se 300 Mbps he jo 3G ke mukaable 50 guna zyada he
 4G has a higher data rate than 3G, which means that data can be transferred at a faster speed
 saath hi is takanic kii keemat bhi 3G ke mukaable kam ho isaki ummid bhi kii ja rahi he kyoki 4G aane se khapat bhi dugane se zyada badhane ke kayaas lagaaye ja rahe hai
 Where 3G technology works on a wide area network, it works on a 4G local area network (LAN) and a base station wide area network
 4G Vs
 3G? Speed: 3G: Maximum 3
 1 Mbps or ausatan 300 Kbps se 1
 5 mbps4g: Ability to increase from 100 to 300 Mbps at 2-40 Mbps

 - OFDMA (orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) allows you to enjoy excellent quality (720p and 1080p) videos without interruption
 - 4G ke aane se speed badhane ke saath, uniform ho jaaegi
 This means that the amount of data that will be ordered from your phone will be available to you at equal speed
 masalaa ye he ki agar aap fasebuk ke sathutyub par koi videodekhate he to speed ghat jaati he par 4G ke aane se aisa nahin hoga
 - No interruptions will be seen during video calling

 Ajinkya Rahane may have dropped MS Dhoni in the one-day match against Bangladesh, but his performance of the last two years finally got him the reward
 27 saal ke rahane ko zimbabwe daure ke liye team india kaa captain banaaya gaya he
 For the first time in a cricket career, Rahane has got the chance to captain a big team and he is also the team of Team India directly
 ajinkya rahane ne beete ek saal ke dauraan 25 vanade maichon main do shatak sahit 839 ran banaae hai, lekin is dauraan ve bade hi bharosemand ballebaaz banakar ubhare hai
 He has also been a very successful batsman for India in Test matches
 unhone teen test shatak banaae hai or teenon videshi pichon par
 The biggest reason for Rahane's captaincy for the Zimbabwe tour is that after resting six senior players, Rahane appears to be the players of the current team for whom the selectors could play the bets of the future
 mukhya chayankarta sandip patil ne bhi kaha he ki rahane kaa pradarshan beete do saalon main bahut acha rahaa he
 The comments vaise team main harbhajan singh or murali vijay jaise senior khilaadi jarur maujuud hai, lekin murali vijay ab tak vanade team ke sthaayee sadsy nahin ban paae hai jabaki harbhajan singh chaar saal baad vanade team main vaapasi kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, there could not be a better option than Rahane in front of the selectors
 iske alaava rahane ne khud ko behad kam samay main maior cricketer ke taur par viksit kiya he
 Rahane knows how to control himself in difficult times

 Ajinkya Rahane has scored 839 runs in the last one year, including two centuries in 25 odis, but during this time he has emerged as a very reliable batsman
 test maichon main bhi ve bharat kii ore se khaase kaamyaab ballebaaz rahe hai
 He has scored three Test centuries and all three on foreign pitches
 rahane ko zimbabwe daure ke liye mili captaini kii sabase badi vajah to yahi he ki chah senior khilaadiyon ko aaraam die jane ke baad rahane maujuuda team ke aise khilaadi dikhaai dete hai, jinako lekar chayankarta bhavishya kaa daanv khel sakate the
 Chief selector Sandeep Patil has also said that Rahane's performance has been very good in the last two years
 tippaniyan Although senior players like Harbhajan Singh and Murali Vijay are present in the team, but Murali Vijay has not been able to become a permanent member of the ODI team so far while Harbhajan Singh is returning to the ODI team after four years
 aise main chayankartaaon ke saamne rahane se behatar vikalp nahin ho saktaa tha
 Apart from this, Rahane has developed himself as a match cricketer in a very short time
 mushkil samay main rahane khud par par niyantran rakhana bakhubi jaanate hai
 In such a situation, he will have to prove his ability as a captain on the tour of Zimbabwe

 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne kaha ki rahul gandhi rashtriya raajnneeti main badi bhoomika main aaenge or puraani peedi se yuva haathon main party kii kaman kaa janaa nishchit taur par hoga
 Singh, who praised Rahul Gandhi for making his team at the Congress General Assembly in December, however, did not say anything explicit on how long Rahul will be in his role
 unhone kaha, yah aap khud dekh lenge
 Asked whether he sees the possibility of Rahul Gandhi taking up the responsibility in the near future against the backdrop of being projected as the future Prime Minister, Digvijay Singh said, "surely he (rahul) will play a bigger role
" yah puche jane par ki kya vah is baat se sahamat hai ki party main yuvaaon ko mahatvapurn jimmedaari saunpe jane kii prakriya dhimi raftaar se chal rahi hai, unhone kaha, yah dhimaa he, lekin nishchit he
 He said that this is sure to happen
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhale hi notebandi ke mudde par centre sarkaar ke saath khadey hon, lekin ye bhi kisi se chipa nahin ki unki sahyogi partiyaan khaskar rashtriya janata dal or congress party is mudde par unase ittefaq nahin rakhti
 a living example of this was seen on Sunday when the education minister of Bihar, Ashok Chaudhary, in the Digi Dhan Mela organized by the Central Government, told the Union Minister Radha Mohan Singh about the issue in a packed meeting
 ashok choudhary bihar congress ke adhyaksh bhi hai or bihar ke iti mantri bhi hai
 He was also sitting on a dharna in Patna in view of the problems faced by the common people due to demonetisation two days ago
 puure desh main digital bhugtan ko badhaava dene ke liye aam logon ke bich jaagrukta badhaane ke makasad se patna main yojit sammelan main kendriya krishi mantri radhamohan singh ke baad jab ashok choudhary bhaashan dene pahunche, to shuruyaat to unhone radha mohan singh ko apana abhibhavak bataate hue kiya lekin iske baad unhone centre sarkaar par karaara hamalaa bol diya
 In fact, Chaudhary wanted to reverse the satire on Bihar's legal system in Radha Mohan Singh's speech
 unhone kaha ki ye kaisaa digital yug he, jisamen logon kii gardan pakadakar i-pement ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 For the first time, a minister in the Bihar government has attacked the Center over digital payments from a public platform
 choudhary ne apane bhaashan main poocha ki aakhir tranjaction tex kyon liya ja rahaa he? unhone sawaal kiya ki jis rajya main 500 panchayat main bainkon kaa abhaav he or rigerv bank dwaara 1700 nae branch kholane ke lakshya ke baavjood maatr 70 branch khule hai, waisi haalat main digital pement ko aam logon ke bich kaise le jaaya ja saktaa he
 On this occasion, Chaudhary also mentioned the reduction in central assistance being received by the education department and said that the digital age cannot be brought in the country by cutting the budget of the education department
 tippaniyan Though Radhamohan Singh had already spoken, later, reacting to Ashok Chaudhary's speech, he said that people of such party (congress) are asking questions to those who have ruled the center for 60 years
 kendriya mantri ne yah bhi kaha ki ashok choudhary ne apni hi party dwaara desh kii kya durdasha kii gai he, uskaa bakhaan kiya he
 However, Radhamohan Singh also believed that since Chaudhary is speaking according to his party's line, it is no surprise
 is bich janata dal united notebandi par apni samiksha baithak ko lekar philhal kisi jaldbaaji ke mood main nahin dikhti
 According to the party leaders, right now Nitish Kumar is busy preparing for a human series on vasectomy organized on January 21 after Kalachakra Puja, Nischay Yatra
 party maanati he ki notebandi se logon ko ho rahi pareshaani main ab kami ai he
 Ashok Chaudhary is also the President of Bihar Congress and IT Minister of Bihar
 do din pehle notebandi se aam logon ko ho rahi pareshaaniyon ke maddenjar vah patna main dharne par bhi baithe the
 When Ashok Chaudhary came to give a speech after Union Agriculture Minister Radhamohan Singh at a conference held in Patna with a view to increase awareness among the common people to promote digital payments across the country, he started by calling Radha Mohan Singh as his guardian But after this, he attacked the central government
 choudhary darasal radhamohan singh ke bhaashan main bihar kii vidhi vyavastha par kiye gaye vyangy par palatwaar karnaa chaahate the
 He said that this is the kind of digital age in which e-payment is being promoted by holding the neck of the people
 bihar sarkaar ke kisi mantri ne pehali baar kisi saarvajanik manch se centre par digital bhugtan ko lekar hamalaa bolaa he
 In his speech, Chaudhary asked why Transaction Tax is being charged? He questioned how digital payments can be carried among the common people in a state which lacks banks in 500 panchayats and only 70 branches are open despite the Reserve Bank's target of opening 1700 new branches
 choudhary ne is maukey par shiksha vibhaag ko mil rahi kendriya sahaayta main katautee kaa bhi zikr kiya or kaha ki shiksha vibhaag ke bajet main katautee kar desh main digital yug nahin laayaa ja saktaa
 The comments haalanki radhamohan singh pehle hi bol chuke the, lekin baad main ashok choudhary ke bhaashan par pratikriya dete hue unhone kaha ki aisi party (congress) ke log unase sawaal puch rahe he, jinhone centre main 60 varshon tak raaj kiya he
 The Union Minister also said that Ashok Chaudhary has described the plight of the country by his own party
 haalanki radhamohan singh ne yah bhi mana ki chunki choudhary apni party ke line ke anusaar bol rahe hai, isliye yah koi aashcharya kii baat nahin he
 Meanwhile, the Janata Dal does not seem to be in any hurried mood for its review meeting on United Demonetisation

 Despite Sunil Gavaskar playing five Test matches at Lord's in the fifteen years from 1971 to 1986, when the desire to score a century on cricket's corn could not be fulfilled, he became part of the rest of the World XI team to fulfill his wish
 gavaskar ne agast 1987 main shesh vishwa or emsisi ekadash ke bich khele gaye match kii pehali pari main 188 ran banaakar apni ichha puri kii thi
 Now it is the turn of Sachin Tendulkar, another Little Master from India, who may be very close to scoring a century in international cricket, but he has not yet scored a half-century at Lord's and not only Tendulkar but went on a tour of India in India
 None of the team's players have been able to take a hundred till now on the mecca of cricket
 rahul dravid ne isi maidan par apane test karier kaa aagaaj kiya tha lekin tab vah 95 ran banaakar out ho gaye the
 VVS Laxman averaged 57 on this ground
 00 he lekin unka ucchtam score bhi 74 ran he
 Virender Sehwag and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni have also played on this ground but they too have been missing out on a century
 yuvaraj singh or gautam gambhir ne lords par test match nahin khele hai jabaki ekadivasiy antarrashtriya cricket main koi bhi bhartiya ab tak lords par shatak nahin jad paaya he
 The first thing to talk about is Tendulkar
 is star ballebaaj ne 1990 se lekar 2007 tak lords par chaar test match khele hai lekin inamen unka ucchtam score 37 ran rahaa he
 He scored 21 in these four matches
 28 kii ausat se 149 ran banaae hai
 He has scored only 45 runs in the three odis he played at Lord's
 dravid ne to 1996 main apana pehla test match hi lords par khelaa tha
 While batting at number seven, he was caught by the wicketkeeper when he was playing for 95 runs
 yah vahi match tha jisamen saurav ganguli ne bhi apane test karier kaa aagaaj karte hue 131 ran kii joardaar pari kheli thi
 Dravid then played four other innings here, scoring 46, 63, two and nine runs
 chaar van de main bhi dravid yahaan koi shatak nahin laga paae
 Laxman is waiting for the first century against this team not only on England soil
 jahaan tak lords kii baat he to veri-veri special kaa is maidan par chaar pariyon main score naabad 43, 74, 15 or 39 ran rahaa he
 He was able to score nine runs in one day at Lord's
 dhoni ne 2007 main yahaan ek test match khelaa
 In his first innings, he rolled to zero while in the second innings he remained unbeaten after scoring 76 runs
 sahvaag 21 july se shuru hone vaale pehle test match main nahin khelenge or is tarah se unhen cricket ke makka par shatak banane ke liye intjaar karnaa hoga
 Sehwag has played a match against Lord's in which his highest score is 84 runs
 jahaan tak lords par shatakon kii baat he to phir dilip vengsarakar kaa naam kaise bhulaayaa ja saktaa he jinhone is maidan par lagaataar teen shrinkhalaaon main teen shatak jadkar nayaa vishwa ricard kaayam kiya tha
 He has also scored the most 508 runs for India at Lord's
 yahaan tak ki ajit agarkar ko bhi lords par test shatak banane kaa gaurav hasil he
 Apart from these, Veenu Mankad, Gundappa Vishwanath, Mohammad Azharuddin, Ravi Shastri and Sourav Ganguly have also scored centuries on Lords
 yadi ekadivasiy antarrashtriya cricket kii baat karen to bharat kii taraf se lords par abhi tak kisi bhi ballebaaj ne shatak nahin jamaaya he
 The highest score of an Indian here is 90 runs in One Day, which is recorded in the name of Ganguly

 He was already a serial rapist
 lekin wo serial repist hone ke saath-saath psico repist bhi he, ye ab pataa chalaa he
 No one else, but the police investigating the case, says
 shaayad aapako yakeen nahin hoga, lekin ye sach he ki cab rape cond jaisi vaardaat ko anjaam dene vaale shaks ko ab bhi apane kiye par koi pachhtaawaa nahin he
 Rather, he is saying that girls die on him, because he is Cupid
 jis shaks kii ek harakat ne puure desh ko hilaa diya
 One of whose handiwork started a fresh debate on the safety of women in the capital
 jisaki kerani par sadak se lekar sansad tak logon kaa gussa footataa rahaa
 Due to which the company of cab companies got involved
 jisaki vajah se dilli police ke kamishnar grih mantralay main talab kar liye gaye or jiske kiye par khud desh ke grih mantri ko sansad ke donon sadanon main bayaan dena pad gaya
 Now when the same person is speaking, the police are also surprised to hear
 kyonki use ab bhi naa to apane kiye par koi afsos he or naa is baat kaa ehsaas ki jo kuch usne kiya, wo kitna galat tha
 According to the Delhi Police, during the three-day interrogation, he confessed to raping the girl in his cab
 lekin saath hi is baat kii hairaani bhi jataai ki aakhir us raat ke baad ladki ne police main report kaise likhva di? sutron kii maane to poochtacha main yadav ne kaha ki aaj tak kisi bhi ladki ne use rishte ke liye kabhi naa nahin kaha, kyonki wo behad smart, handsam or gudluking he
 He even said that the fight that he tries to get closer, he considers himself lucky
 kyonki wo to jeeta-jaagta kaamdev he
 For a while, the police, who had been accused of not having one but the serial rapist on his head, were surprised
 usase poochtacha kar rahe afasaron ko ab ye samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki yadav kii ye dinge darasal uske dimag kharaab ho jane kii nishaani he yaa phir aisi baaten kar wo khud ko ek psyco yani pagal sabit kar police ko uljhane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 However, if we go to the inquiry so far, then the police are also considering him as a psycho case along with the serial rapist
 lekin use jehani taur par biimaar qaraar dene se pehle abhi police ko bhi kai exparts kii raay lene kii darkaar he
 Going to the facts revealed in the interrogation, Yadav had also told the girl to have 15-20 cabs with her and said that all these taxis run with Uber cabs
 or wo achche-khaase rupee kamata he
 If the police sources are to be believed, then leave aside the face and body language, Shiv Kumar Yadav has also bluntly said that there is no regret of being tortured with the girl
 kehete to hai kanoon ke haath bahut lambey hote hai, lekin shiv kumaar yadav har baar in lambey haathon se batch nikalataa rahaa
 If he is now opening the book of his crimes, then the truth is known
 or sach ye he ki shiv kumaar yadav jis tarah se har baar jurm kar bachataa rahaa, usee se uskaa hausala badhata gaya
 And the fear of the law kept going from his heart
 or dekhte hi dekhte wo ek serial repist ban gaya
 But now the police want to put a fullstop on his crimes
 isiilie is baar mathura se lekar dilli or dilli se lekar neujersey tak se uske khilaaf subut ikattha kiye ja rahe hai
 After three days of interrogation and investigation of Muljim Shiv Kumar Yadav of Delhi cab rape case, so much evidence has been gathered against him that the uniformers are sure that this time this cyco rapist will not come out of the bars so easily
 shiv kumaar yadav ko lambey vakt tak bade ghar main band karne ke liye police ne naa sirf kai ahm forensik avidence ikattha kiye hai, balki america ke new jersey main rahanevaali us ladki se bhi baat kii he, jiske saath isse pehle shiv kumaar yadav ne badsuluki kii thi
 According to the police, then this girl had complained to the Uber cab company about Yadav
 lekin iske baavjood company ne is shikaayat par koi khaas tavajjo nahin di
 The Delhi Police, who arrested Yadav came to Delhi on the night itself after running for nearly a quarter of a kilometer in Mathura on Sunday evening
 iske baad somvaar ko use tees hajaari court main pesh karne ke baad police ne teen dinon kii remand par liya
 At the time of his arrest, the police took the cab used in the incident ie Swift Diaz car
 lekin vaardaat ke vakt pahane gaye mulgim ke kapade or mobile phone sareekhe kai chijen abhi baraamad kerani baaki thim
 So, as soon as the police took Yadav into custody, he went on his own connecting all the episodes of the Yadav incident
 iske baad police ne uske kapadon ke saath-saath wo mobile phone bhi baraamad kar liya, shiv kumaar yadav jise hameshaa apane paas rakhata tha
 Actually, iphone including Uber's app was given to Yadav from Uber company
 shuukravaar-shanivaar kii raat ko vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke baad shiv kumaar ne apana ye ai-phone swissd of kar liya tha, taaki police ko dhokhaa de sake
 At first he was also very successful in this endeavor, but soon the police came to know of two more mobile phones
 or iske baad technical servilans ke saath-saath ingelligence input kii badaulat wo daboch liya gaya
 During the investigation, not only the raw material of many old crimes of Yadav was exposed
 balki ye bhi saaf hua ki usne do driving license banavaa rakhe the
 However, the police later found that one of these licenses was fake
 lihaaza, ab police ne yadav ke khilaaf rape ke saath-saath farjivade ke mukademe kii bhi tafteesh shuru kar di he
 It was also clear that Shiv Kumar Yadav had also obtained a fake character certificate of Delhi Police
 police ko shaq he ki is farji certificate ke aadhaar par hi usne driving license banwaaya hoga
 In such a situation, the police is trying to understand the role of Yadav as well as the officers of that transport authority
 police kaa daawa he ki uski cab or kapadon se bhi kai aise subut mili hai, jo yadav kii taabut main keel kaa kaam karenge
 Meanwhile, Shiv Kumar Yadav was produced in court on Thursday after a remand of three days and from there he was sent to jail till December 24
 haalanki is maamle main bhadke logon ke gusse or 16 disambar ke maamle ke muljimon ke saath hui pitayee ke maamalon ko dekhte hue jail main uske liye alag se suraksha intjaam kiye gaye hai
 On Thursday, the police also told the court how they had obtained two licenses by fraudulent means
 is par adaalat ne uske saath-saath transport othority ke khilaaf bhi karrwai kii baat kahi
 Obviously, now the police want to file a charge sheet in this case as soon as possible
 taaki shiv kumaar ko uske anjaam tak pahunchaaya ja sake
 Five Rape, Molestation, Punk Act, Arms Act and Na Jaane kya-kya
 dilli ke cab driver shiv kumaar yadav ke gunahon kii fehrist behad lambii he
 Something is so long that now there is a long list of its persecuted people from Delhi to Mainpuri and Mainpuri to America
 lekin kamaal hamaare system kaa bhi kam nahin ki itnaa kuch hone ke baavjood wo har baar ek nai vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke liye baahar aa jaataa tha
 Of course, this identity of Shiv Kumar Yadav has come to the fore now, but the reality is that he has been continuously committing crimes one after another since he took his senses
 or ye shaayad uski jehniyat hi he ki uske gunahon kii fehrist main ladakiyon or mahilaon kii asmat par haath daalane ke gunaah sabase zyaada hai
 Including this incident of raping a girl after picking a girl in her cab, so far, roughly five rape cases and one molestation case have been detected against her
 jabaki khud uske gaanv ke log bataate hai ki usne apane hi gaanv main itani ladakiyon or mahilaon kii aabru par haath daalaa he ki uskaa koi hisaab hi nahin he
 Apparently, the people of the village, police and the family members of Shiv Kumar Yadav himself believe that he is a serial rapist

 sankatagrast pakistani pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani avmaananaa ke aaropon kaa saamana karne ke liye somvaar ko sheersh nyaayalay ke samaksh pesh honge
 In this case, his fate may be decided and if he refuses to reopen corruption cases against the President, the country can go through a new period of political instability
 59 varshiya gilaani ne ucchtam nyaayalay main apni peshi se pehle kaha ki yadi nyaayalay ne pakistani raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ke khilaaf switzraland main bhrashtachar ke maamalon ko phir kholane se inkaar karne ke maamle main unhen doshi qaraar diya to vah apane pad se tyaagptr de denge
 He said in an interview to Alajjira, "there is definitely no need to step down, in that case i cannot even remain a Member of Parliament
" ’gilaani ne kaha, ‘vartmaan samay main mere shaktishaalee sena ke saath achche sambandh hai
 'some time ago there was tension in the relationship between Gilani and the army over the memo scandal for several weeks
 unhone kaha ki unhen america kii ore se abtabad main osama bin laden ko maarane ke liye kii gai ekatarfa karrwai se ‘niraashaa’ hui thi
 He said, 'they should have shared information about this
 yahi kaaran tha ki yah ekatarfa karrwai thik nahin nahin thi
 Gilani said that he would automatically be disqualified from membership of Parliament if convicted by the Supreme Court
 yadi gilaani doshi qaraar diye jate hai ki to unhen chah varsh kii sajaa ho sakati he or unhen pad se hataane ke saath hi paanch varsh tak koi bhi saarvajanik pad grahan karne par roak lagaayi ja sakati he
 Giving a strong blow to Geelani, Chief Justice of Pakistan's Supreme Court Iftikhar Chaudhary on Friday rejected his appeal filed against framing of contempt charges
 isse pehle gat 19 janvari ko avmaananaa kaa maamla jab aayaa to gilaani vyaktigat rup se nyaayalay main pesh hue or kaha ki sarkaar raashtrapati ke khilaaf maamalon ko phir se shuru nahin kar sakati he kyonki unhen pakistan or videsh main puri tarah se chhot hasil he
 Dismissing Gilani's arguments, the court told him that no person is above the law and that you have no choice but to write a letter to the Swiss authorities to resume the corruption case against Zardari
 yah puche jane par ki kya vah maanate hai ki vah jail jaaenge, gilaani ne kaha ki vah yah nahin maanate ki aisa hoga ‘jaisaa aapane sochaa he
 'he reiterated that he has not written to Switzerland authorities to reopen the money laundering case against Zardari as he is exempt not only in Pakistan but' all over the world '
 ’gilaani ne kaha ki jaradaari varsh 2008 main sansad ke donon sadanon or chaar prantiy vidhansabhaon dwaara chunaa gaya or us samay koi aapatti nahin thi
 Sources in the ruling Pakistan People's Party said that it is expected that when Gilani appears in the court, he will stick to his stand
 kanoonee visheshgyon ne kaha ki doshi qaraar diye jane ke baad raashtrapati ke paas unhen kshamaadaan dene kaa adhikaar he
 Eminent lawyer and MP SM Zafar said that the President's pardon will apply only if the sentence is pronounced by the court but in that case his conviction will remain on record
 isliye raashtrapati kii ore se kshamaadaan ke baavjood pradhanmantri ayogy ghoshit ho sakate hai

 There are many pieces in this entire game, but the mastermind is the one who is sitting across seven seas
 jiju janardan bana sattebaajon kaa asli moharadarasal, shuruyaat hui srisanth ke club cricket ke saathi jiju se
 When Jiju left Kerala and made contacts in Dubai, it fell into the hands of the betting syndicate
 jiju ko sattebaaji ke peeche chehron kii bhanak nahin thi
 He did not know that the real betting players inside and outside the stadium are the brothers of Mumbai who run the black world of the underworld
 udhar, jurm ke bhaaiyon ko jab ye pataa chalaa kii jiju kii jeb main cricket kaa ek bada jugnu jagamaga rahaa he to betting ke baadshahon kii laar tapakane lagi
 He felt that Sreesanth could be reached through Jiju

 The revelations have once again proved that this black game of fixing involves the entire staff of the underworld sitting in Dubai
 tasviren kai baar gavaahi de chuki hai ki di company or cricket kaa conection saalon purana he
 When India and Pakistan cricket matches took place in Sharjah in the 80s, d Company leader Dawood Ibrahim and his family took a seat in the VIP box, and perhaps by the end of the 80s, d Company did black business in Indian cricket
 Had started darasal 90 ke dashak main chota rajan or sharad shetty dubai main baithkar daaud ibrahim ke liye cricket kaa cartal chalaate the
 After the 1993 bomb blasts, when Chhota Rajan and Dawood split up, two betting syndicates in cricket were also formed
 sabase bada sindicket daaud kaa finance sanbhaalane vaala sharad shetty chalaata tha
 To capture the betting business, Chhota Rajan shot and killed Sharad Shetty at the India Club in Dubai
 lekin 2005 aate-aate sharad shetty kaa kaam mumbai ke ek vyapaaree sunil mirchandani urf sunil dubai ne sambhala
 Sunil Dubai is said to be directly linked to Dawood's brother Anees Ibrahim and together they are running the black business of Asia's biggest cricket betting

 In 2007 also during the World Cup match, betting of about 700 crores was revealed on the India and Bangladesh match, behind which d Company's hand was revealed
 sitambar 2010 main bhi ek pakistani satorie ne khulaasa kiya tha ki zyaadaatar satorie daaud ibrahim ke control main hi kaam karte hai
 In March 2011 too, the people of Dawood Ibrahim gang were arrested by the Mumbai police for betting
 march 2012 main ek sting oparation ke baad khulaasa hua ki 2011 world cap kaa bharat-paksitan match bhi fiks tha jiske peeche di company ke taar jude the
 The d company does not play cricket but is definitely carrying out the business of blackening the game of cricket
 pradhanmantri narendra modi loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav ko ek saath karaane kii vakaalat karte rahe hai
 JDU, a re-ally of BJP in Bihar, has again mixed yes on this issue of Modi
 jediu ke bihar pradesh adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh ne kaha he ki agar loksabhaa chunaav ke saath-saath bihar vidhansabha kaa chunaav ho, to party iske liye taiyaar he
 Darasalbihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumarakafi has been insisting that the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections should be held simultaneously to save money and resources in the country
 nitish kumaar ne puure desh main ekasaath loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav karaane kii vakaalat kuch saal pehle kii thi, tab jediu bijepi ke saath thi or ab jab ek baar phir is mudde ko uthaaya gaya he, tab bhi wo bijepi ke saath hai
 Assembly elections in Bihar are going to be held in 2020, while Lok Sabha elections are in 2019
 aise main bihar vidhansabha ko lagbhag dedh saal pehle bhang karnaa hoga
 Only then will the assembly elections be held along with the Lok Sabha elections
 aise main maujuuda vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal saadhe teen saal kaa hi rah jayega
 While the opposition is not ready for this
 argedy netaa or bihar kepurv dipti siem tejasvi yadavane saaf kaha he ki bijepi ke dabaav main jediu is tarah kaa faisla lene ko majaboor he
 With the Lok Sabha elections, just holding the Bihar assembly elections will not work
 desh ke baaki rajyon ko bhi saath aana padegaa
 There are many states in which the tenure will not be even two years or even less
 aise main ek maapdand banaae bina yah sambhav nahin he
 JDU and BJP can benefit in holding Bihar assembly elections with Lok Sabha
 sabase bada phayda siton ke talmail ko lekar he
 Secondly, RJD is continuously accusing Nitish Kumar that he is standing with the BJP by insulting the mandate
 argedy ke 80 vidhayak hai, 2005 main satta se baahar hone ke baad wo abhi sabase majboot sthiti main he or vipaksh main he
 In such a situation, the sooner the election is done, the better sabase bada phayda bijepi or jediu siton ke talmail ko lekar ho saktaa he
 In this, the BJP directly fought more seats in the Lok Sabha and let the JDU fight in the assembly
 haalanki 2013 se pehle donon chunaavon main jediu bade bhai kii bhoomika main bihar main thi, lekin 2014 main bijepi ke majboot hone se sameekaran badalane ke asaar dikh rahe hai

 a post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Sep 20, 2018 at 10:13pm PDT Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has said that pak-american relations should not be given from the point of view of Afghanistan
 kuraishi shanivaar calmericake 10 dine ke daure ke baad swadesh laute
 According to the news of Pakistani newspaper The Dawn, he said in Multan on Saturday that it would be wrong to expect that differences between the US and Pakistan could be resolved in one day
 kuraishi ne kaha ki kshetreey halaat badalte hai or jaruratein bhi badalati hai lekin kshetreey shanti or sthirataa main pakistan ke yogadan ko sweekaar kiya janaa chahie
 He said that it would not be right that our (us-pakistan) relations go back seven decades and look through Afghanistan or Indian glasses
 videsh mantri ne kaha ki unhone america prashasan ko yah samajhane kii koshish kii he
 During his 10-day tour, Qureshi met with American counterpart Mike Ponpio and National Security Advisor John Bolton in Washington
 kuraishi ne kaha ki mahaj ek daure main pakistan or america ke bich matbhedon ko sulajhane kii aashaa karnaa bemaani hogi
 Qureshi made it clear that he neither went to the United States for financial aid nor the issue was included in his talks
 kuraishi ke mutabik, is saal shuru main washington ne jo fund radd kiya, vah rimbarsament tha na ki aarthik madad
 Qureshi said in the end that the Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf Party did not pursue a case against former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, but the court, so the court's decision should be respected

 janata dal united ke purv adhyaksh sharad yadav ko lekar bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar aise funs gaye hai ki na to sharad ko party se nikaal sakate hai or na hi unhen der tak saath rakh sakate hai
 Actually, Sharad Yadav is angry with Nitish breaking ties with the grand alliance and openly adopting rebellious attitude
 aise main party ke rajyasabha saansad sharad yadav par nitish kumaar karrwai to chaahate hai lekin niyamon ne aisa pench fansaa diya he ki chaahakar bhi aisa nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Recently, JDU parliamentary party leader RCP Singh and General Secretary Sanjay Jha met Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and demanded action against Sharad Yadav in Rajya Sabha
 jediu chaahati hai ki venkaiya rajyasabha ke sabhapati hone ke naate sharad kii sadsyta khatm kar den kyonki sharad party ke khilaaf kaam kar rahe hai
 The question arises that if Nitish really wants action on Sharad, then why not exclude him from the party itself
 aakhir wo karrwai ke liye rajyasabha ke sabhapati ke sahare kyon hai?rajyasabha kii sadsyta se fansaa he penchadrasalsharad yadavako agar nitish kumaar khud ection lekar party se nishkasit karte hai, to aisi sthiti main unki rajyasabha sadsyta khatm nahin hogi
 On the other hand, if Sharad Yadav leaves the party himself, his Rajya Sabha membership will be lost
 yahi vajah he ki jediu chaahati he ki sharad yaa to party se istipha de den yaa rajyasabha ke sabhapati unpar karrwai karte hue unki sadsyta samaapt kar den
 In fact, the 10th schedule of the constitution also provides for membership on out-of-house conduct and before that BJP had canceled the membership of its Rajya Sabha member Jai Narayan Nishad and Janata Dal United, Upendra Kushwaha
 isi ke maddenjar jediu netaa aaaraseepi singh or sanjay jha ne sharad yadav or ali anwar kii rajyasabha sadsyta khatm karne ke liye uparashtrapati venkaiya naidu ko gyaapan diya he
 Sharad Yadav may present himself as a martyr if Nitish takes direct action against Sharad and shows him a way out of the party, Sharad Yadav does not want to be a martyr, so there can be sympathy in his favor
 ye vajah bhi he ki nitish kumaar unke khilaaf sidhi karrwai se batch rahe hai
 Unsuccessful rebellion in the party, direct action against Sharad may lead to a revolt in the party
 isiilie nitish bahut phoonk-phoonk kar kadam rakh rahe hai
 Actually, Sharad Yadav has also been the national president of JDU for a long time
 aise main unke bhi sanghathan main kaaphi log hai
 If Nitish takes any direct action, there is a possibility of division in the organization
 philhal nitish is tarah kaa koi vivaad nahin paidaa karnaa chaahate
 Although they have lost the battle, former Karnataka Chief Minister B
 es
 Yeddyurappa's desperate civil war is gaining momentum in every respect
 aise main kya unka uttaradhikari aane vaale sirdard se batch saktaa he? mridubhashi or hameshaa muskaraate rahane vaale nae mukhyamantri 58 varshiya sadanand gauda ko kam se kam apane paas dardanaashak dawaaon kaa bhandar rakhana hoga
 Yeddyurappa has already given a clear indication of his intention
 apane istife ko ek rajnatik naatak main badalane ke liye ve apni shakti kaa pradarshan karte hue bhaajapa ke 70 vidhayakon, vidhaan parishad ke 20 sadasyon or karnataka ke 14 saansadon ke saath padayatra karke rajbhavan tak gaye jise dekhakar party alaakaman bhi chakra gaya
 Gowda of Vokkaliga community defeated Jagdish Shettar, candidate of BJP National General Secretary Anant Kumar, during a secret ballot
 rashtriya raajnneeti main apane badhate prabhaav kii vajah se anant kumaar ke karnataka ke rajnatik halkon main bahut kam dost hai
 Even Yeddyurappa's opponents prefer the former chief minister over Ananth Kumar
 gauda 2007 se 2010 ke bich bhaajapa kii karnataka ikai kaa netritv kar chuke hai, lekin unhen prashasnic anubhav nahin hai kyonki ve kabhi mantri nahin rahe
 Yeddyurappa, who led the BJP in Karnataka to a historic victory in Karnataka south of Vindhyachal in 2008 and then in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, has announced a statewide tour to garner public support
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki unka koi ''vyaktigat agenda nahin'' he or ve ''remote control haath main liye super mukhyamantri'' nahin bananaa chaahate
 But despite this, he did not refrain from claiming that he would return as chief minister in the next six months, although Gowda is expected to rule 22 months
 gauda bhale hi yeddiurppa ke bharosemand or unke kheme ke vafaadaar hai, lekin unki muskaan main tanaav jhlakane laga he
 It will not be easy for Gowda to take over the chair of the Chief Minister of Karnataka because of Yeddyurappa's pressure and Shettar being on his head as Deputy Chief Minister
 yeddiurppa jis tarah rajnath singh, arun jetali or em
 For a week, senior leaders like Venkaiah Naidu kept dancing at their fingertips, proving that whether they are Chief Ministers or not, they cannot be easily defeated in Karnataka politics
 bhaajapa alaakaman ne bhi acchhee tarah samaj liya he ki unki taraf se khatra abhi kam nahin hua he
 If Yeddyurappa is respected in the ranks of BJP, people are also afraid of him
 ve akele aise netaa hai jinhen jan samarthan hasil he
 Being Lingayat increases their strength
 yahi vajah ki harek lingayat math unka samarthan karata he
 They donate huge sums of money to them
 yeddiurppa ne jitne khule tareeke se party netritv ke nirdeshon kaa ulanghan kiya, vaisaa haal ke dinon main kisi mukhyamantri ne nahin kiya hoga
 He did not care for the party's senior leaders or the party's instructions, although he continued to publicly show that he would "obey the command of the party leadership
" ''unke dhur virdohi anant kumaar ne shetter ko samarthan dekar lingayat samudaay kii goti chal di
 Shettar, like Yeddyurappa, is a Lingayat, but the secret voting decision made it clear which side the loyalty of the Lingayat community is
 matdaan ke baad bhaajapa ne faisla kiya tha ki mukhyamantri pad ke kis daavedaar ke paksh main kitne vot pade the, vah iskaa khulaasa nahin karegi
 But the news that Gowda got 63 votes in favor while Shettar could only get 59 votes was leaked to the media within minutes of Gowda being welcomed as the next chief minister
 aisa shaayad yeddiurppa samarthakon ne apane prabhaav kaa pradarshan karne ke liye hi kiya hoga
 One of the many challenges before the new government of Karnataka is to initiate action against those whose former Lokayukta N
 santosh hegade kii vyapak report main ginaae gaye hai
 There is speculation in political circles that Yeddyurappa's resignation was finally achieved on the condition that no action will be taken against him in the illegal mining case
 is silsile main gauda kaa kaam aasaan nahin hoga
 Like his mentor, he is also accused of carrying the burden of a land scam
 bataaya jaataa he ki mukhyamantri pad par nirvaachit hone se pehle hi un par ek jameen ghotaale main fanse hone kaa aarope he
 Gowda will take care of the unpleasant responsibility while answering questions about his personal integrity as he takes over the state riddled with corruption
 yah spasht he ki yeddiurppa kisi bhavi karrwai khaskar saamne aae ghotaale ke baad kanoonee karrwai se khud ko bachaane ke liye apane hi logon kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai
 His next demand will probably be a change in the presidency of the Karnataka BJP
 nivartmaan mukhyamantri ne apana iraadaa spasht kiya he ki ve party kaa adhyaksh bananaa pasand karenge, varanaa is pad ke liye kisi vyakti kaa chayan khud karenge
 If Yeddyurappa, who created the BJP in Karnataka, sees any danger on himself, then he is ready to sacrifice all the achievements which he has been achieving for the party for many years
 itane varshon se ve satta kaa kendrikaran karte aae hai or mana jaataa he ki unki sahmati ke bina koi file aage nahin badhati
 Yeddyurappa's rule of 38 months as Chief Minister and 20 months as Deputy Chief Minister in the state was hardly as controversial as it has been
 mukhyamantri banane ke baad se hi unke khilaaf shikaayatein aane lagi thim or party main chote-mote vidroh janm lene lage the
 Yet they believe that if the party conducts elections, they can break the party and win the election
 kendriya netritv pehle hi yeddiurppa kii badmijaaji kaa swaad chakh chukaa he
 This is enough to sustain him in the crucial position in the Karnataka BJP
 jaisaa guru vaisaa chellpane rajnatik guru bi
 s
 yeddiurppa ke nakshekadam par chalate hue karnataka ke nae mukhyamantri devargunda venkatappa sadanand gauda padbhaar sanbhaalane se pehle hi ek jameen ghotaale main funs chuke hai
 The information received by a Bangalore daily under the Right to Information Act states that the Udupi MP violated the laws of the Bangalore Development Authority by adding two residential properties in Bangalore
 donon jagahen mukhyamantri ke vivekadhin kota ke antargat aavantit kii gai thim
 The rules of the Bangalore Development Authority clearly state that two places can be merged only when both the properties belong to the same person
 praadhikaran ke ek adhikari kaa kahana he, ''jo sampatti aapke bacchon yaa bhai-bahan kii ho yaa yahaan tak ki vivaahit dampati kii bhi he use milakar ek nahin kiya ja saktaa
 "the fourth provision of settlement between the buyer and the authority prohibits the landlord from using the property for any other purpose than the declared purpose
" gauda kii sampatti ke maamle main, jameen kaa rihaayshi sampatti ke rup main adhigrahan kiya gaya or ab yah samajha jaataa he ki do rihaayshi sthalon main faili jameen par ek paanch manjila vyavsaayik parisar kaa nirmaan kiya ja rahaa he

 Despite being rejected, they went ahead and added plots to build a commercial complex
 is tarah gauda ne teen tareeke se-rihaayshi plot par vyavsaayik parisar kaa nirmaan karke, praadhikaran kii ore se anurodh ko khaarij karne ke baad bhi do sampattiyon ko gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se ek karke or paanch manjila imaarat kaa nirmaan karke-niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya he jabaki niyam keval teen manzilen banane kii hi ijaajat detaa he

 input language viraat kohli dinon karname par karname kiye ja rahe hai ki agle kai din baad bhi koi na koi record baahar nikal kar aa ja rahaa he
 On Sunday, former Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews gave him the gum, but by Monday Virat Kohli had calculated this gum in his own style
 kohli ne maithyuj ko aisa jhatka diya, jisase yah srilankai olerounder pataa nahin ubar bhi paaegaa, yaa nahin ! Actually, it happened that on the second day of Kotla Test, very easy catch of Virat Kohli was dropped in the evening slip
 tab to viraat ko iskaa zyada gam nahin hua lekin jyon-jyon vakt gujarata gaya, vaise-vaise kohli ko yah kaich bahut gam de gaya
 The reason for the gum was that Mathews hit a century by roasting around the abandoned catches for almost a hundred runs
 magar tisare din kohli kaa ek aisa karnama nikalakar aayaa, jisane maithyuj ko peeche chhod diya
 Also read: That's why Virat Kohli is afraid of playing 'anything' with Pujara! darasal srilankai olerounder ne teen saal pehle bahut hi special record bana daalaa tha
 Matthews then played 65 matches in 53 matches played in all formats (test, ODI-T20) throughout the year

 But now Virat has left him behind
 jari saal main balle jo aag kohli ne ugali, usase viraat ek saal ke bheetar sabhi formanton main sabase zyada ran banane vaale tisare number ke ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 Virat has reached the third position in this case by scoring 2,768 runs in the year 2017 so far

 vaise aapako bataa den ki viraat ne saal 2017 main 6 main of da match or do baar main of da siries kaa khitaab bhi apni jholii main daalaa
 Back to back double darasal hua yah ki kotla test ke duusare din shaam ko slip main viraat kohli se angelo maithyuj kaa bahut hi aasaan kaich chhitak gaya tha
 Then Virat did not feel much grief, but as time went by, this catch was given a lot of grief to Kohli
 gam kii vajah yah rahi ki maithyuj ne is chode gaye kaich kareeb sau ran ke aas-paas bhunaate hue shatak thok daalaa
 But on the third day, a feat by Kohli came out which left Mathews behind
 yah bhi padhein : isiilie viraat kohli darate hai pujaara ke saath 'kuch bhi' khilne se! Actually the Sri Lankan all-rounder made a very special record three years ago
 tab maithyuj ne saal bhar main sabhi formet ( test, vanade-tii-20) main khele 53 maichon main 65
 He scored 2,687 runs at an average of 53
 lekin ab viraat ne unhen peeche chhod diya he
 Virat Kohli has become the third-highest batsman in all formats in a year due to the fire that Kohli boiled in the ongoing year
 viraat saal 2017 main abhi tak 2,768 ran banaakar is maamle main teesri paaydaan par aa gaye hai

 ' 14 seats in Mumbai's local trains will be reserved for senior citizens
 ye faisla bombai hai court ne har local train main seat rigerv rakhane kaa aadesh diya he, jis par railway ko 15 april se amal karnaa hoga
 The court has clearly told the railway administration that they should ensure that only senior citizens use the reserved seats, no one else
 mumbai main western, central or habrr line kii local main takreeban har din 75 lakh log safar karte hai, in trainon main mahilaon ke liye alag dibbe hote hai, viklangon ke liye bhi dibbe kaa ek hissaa arakshit hota he
 But there is no such facility for senior citizens
 swatantraaa senaanee or senior citigen abi thakkar ne ek yachika daayar kar court se is maamle main faisle kii guhaar lagaai thi
 While giving a ruling on their petition, a bench of Justices Abhay Oak and AK Menon said that some seats are reserved for the elderly in the second class compartment but it has been seen that they are not able to use them
 siton par saaf-saaf likhaa hona chahie ki ve senior citigen ke liye hai
 Earlier, the Railways had argued before the court that it would not be practical for them to reserve seats for senior citizens, or to reserve coaches, as this would reduce the space for common passengers, which could increase the risk of accidents

 Parivartini Ekadashi or Parsva Ekadashi is of special importance
 manyata he ki choumaas yani ki asadha, shravan, bhado or aswin main bhagwaan vishnu sote rahete hai or phir devuthni ekadshi ke din hi uthte hai
 But in these months there also comes a time when Shree Hari Vishnu changes his position while sleeping
 yah samay bhado (bhadra) maas ke shukla paksh kii ekadshi kaa hota he
 This Ekadashi is called Parlatini Ekadashi and on this day there is a law to worship the Vamana avatar of Lord Vishnu
 manyata he ki is ekadshi kaa vrath karne se bhakton ke sabhi paap nasht ho jate hai or mrityu ke baad unhen swarglok kii prapti hoti he
 It is said that by reading or listening to the story of Parlatini Ekadashi, one gets the equivalent of a thousand Ashwamedha Yagya
 apane vaamanavatar main bhagwaan vishnu ne raja bali kii pariksha lee
 King Bali sacrificed his authority over the three worlds, but one of the qualities in it was that he did not send any Brahmin empty-handed
 use daan avashya detaa tha
 The demon Guru Shukracharya also made him aware of the tricks of Lord Vishnu, but despite his sacrifice, he promised to give three feet of land to Lord Vishnu as Vamana
 phir kya tha do pagon main hi bhagwaan vishnu ne samast lokon ko naap diya tisare pag ke liye kuch nahin bachaa to bali ne vachan puraa karte hue apana shish unke pag ke neeche kar diya
 By the grace of Lord Vishnu, Bali began to live in Hatal in the abyss

 Shetty says that working with both these artists is always fun
 41 varshiya nirdeshak shetty isse pehle 'chennai express' ke alaava apni sabhi filmon main ajay ko lekar nirdesan kar chuke hai
 He had Shah Rukh Khan in the Chennai Express
 karina isse pehle rohit kii filmon 'golmaal riterns' or 'golmaal 3' main abhinay kar chuki hai
 Rohit said, 'it is fun to work with these two once again
 main ajay ke saath 'bol bachchan' ke baad or karina ke saath 'golmaal-3' ke baad kaam kar rahaa hum
 Kareena is like a member of my family and Ajay is my brother
 isliye set par mood bahut acha rahata he
 It does not look like we are shooting for the film
 aisa lagata he ki ham sab kahin baahar ghoomane aae hue hai or ekasaath bahut sari masti kar rahe hai
 ' singhm-2 kii shooting goa main chal rahi he
 The film is a sequel to the year 2011 'singham'
 film main ajay ek baar phir pulicekarmi bajirao singhm kii bhoomika nibhaayenge or karina unki premika kii bhoomika main hongi

 mahangaai jhelana chaahate hai yaa mandi? apni takalif chun lijie
 At the moment both are going to grow
 rigerv bank ke anusaar, agle teen maah main jebatrash mahangaai badhegi
 And growth rate 4 in the second quarter of this year
 5 fisad is dhalaan kaa antim chor nahin he
 The recession will deepen in the next six months
 is saal paanch fisad kii vikaas dar bhi naammumkin he
 Inflation is no less complicated than it is because of the slowdown in savings, consumption and investment
 mahangaai ke chhilake utaarne par hi samaj main aata he ki rigerv bank ne byaaj daron main kami roak kar ab mandi se ladaai kaa bidaa sarkaar kii taraf badha diya he or duusari taraf sarkaar yah samaj hi nahin paa rahi he ki koun-si mahangaai acchhee he or koun-si buree yaa ki mandi or mahangaai kii is jodi ko todaa kaise jaae?• aktubar ke maheene main thok mahangaai 40 maheene ke nunatam str par (0
 16 percent), while retail inflation was at 16-month high of 4
 6 fisad par
 Wholesale inflation measures prices at the level of producers, while retail inflation measures the impact on consumers' pockets
 thok mahangaai main ricard kami maang tuutane kaa saboot he jiske kaaran utpaadak (kisaan or udyog) keemten nahin badha paa rahe hai
 The prices of agricultural and food products were below cost till the Rabi season this year
 pichley kai maheenon se menuphaccharing utpaadon kii keemten nahin badi hai
 On the other hand, retail ie consumer inflation had started increasing from January this year, which has now come to the scare level of the government
 thok mahangaai khapat main mandi kaa saboot he or khudara mahangaai mahangi hoti khapat kaa
 The simultaneous manifestation of both is a rare misuse of structural bottlenecks in both demand and supply • The second hitch of inflation is that food-bearing food inflation is increasing due to supply constraints, while domestic consumption goods, due to a decrease in demand, There has not been an increase in prices of services, building, communication, that is, the profits of producers are not increasing
 • shahari or gramin mahangaai kaa antar ek or badi chunauti he
 Rate of increase in food inflation in villages in the month of October 6
 4 fisad thi jabaki shaharon main 10
 5 percent • mahangaai kii paimaaish kaa ek or cheharaa uljhan ko kai guna badhaata he
 According to a recent study by Care Ratings, consumer inflation in 19 states of India was higher than the national average in the last fiscal year, while 11 states had above the rbi's ideal scale (4 per cent), ie our neighborhood inflation, It is completely different from the inflation of the country
 mandi kii roshni main, mahangaai ke antarvirodh ne arthvyavastha ko kathin vikalpon kii sthiti main laa khadaa kiya he
 The entire production sector is suffering from recession
 isamen kisaan or udyog, donon shaamil hai
 Between 2014 and 2019, the pace of growth in agriculture was half of what it was in the previous decade
 kisaan or udyog, donon najariye se keemten badhanaa jaruri he kyonki ab aay va rojgaar bade bagaiyr khapat kaa pahiyaa gum nahin saktaa
 Not surprisingly, despite the recession, the mobile bill and the price of some cars have started increasing
 nagareey upabhoktaaon ke liye is paridrishy main takalif dikhti he
 New jobs have been closed due to the slowdown especially in the employment generating industries and increase in wages
 aisi haalat main bhojan kii mahangaai jindagi kii museebaton main ijapha karegi
 Inflation or price rise is a sensitive measure in India
 is par utpaadakon kaa bhavishya bhi tikaa he or khapat kaa bhi
 The government fixes most of the prices in India's agricultural market
 ghatiya vitaran tantra, bazaar ke phaayde kisaanon tak nahin pahunchane detaa
 On the other hand, industry margins are limited due to heavy taxes, capital shortages and high energy costs, so business profits come from both demand and price increases
 sarkaron ke anaavashyak hastkshep ne bazaar ko bigaad diya he
 Demand in India has not increased in recent years, even after minimum inflation
 ab nitiyon kaa asantulan dam ghont rahaa he
 There is no far-reaching policy on demand-supply of crops nor tax on industries
 sarkaar kabhi pyaaj ke tabadatod aayaat kii taraf daud padati he jisase fasal bazaar kaa santulan bigadataa he to kabhi companiyon par tex ke niyamon main apratyaashit badlaav kar detii he
 As the deficit was increased by reducing corporate tax earlier, preparations are now being made to increase GST
 mandi ke vibhinn sanskarnon main mandi or mahangaai kii jodi (stagflation) sabase jatil he
 This poisonous pair of unemployed and expensive lives surrounds the Indian economy
 sarkaar ko jald hi tay karnaa hoga ki vah mahangaai ko badhane dekar mandi se ubaaregi yaa mandi ko badhane degi
 Election is difficult, but it has to be drowned in the river and there is no easy alternative

 The party has officially distanced itself from this slogan

 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath has termed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) resolution letter issued on Monday for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections as a jumla letter
 kamalnath ne jari ek bayaan main kaha he, "48 pej ke 75 sankalpon vaale is sankalp-patr main ek baar phir bhaajapa ke 2014 ke ghoshnaa-patr ke puraane vaadon ko shaamil kar jhuthe sapane dikhaane va janata ko gumraah karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 "kamal Nath further said," Whether it is the matter of Ram temple, the matter of removing Article 370, all these things were also done by BJP in the 2014 manifesto
 lekin puure paanch varsh tak in vaadon ko bhaajapa bhuuli rahi, ab 2019 main ek baar phir in vaadon ko doharaa kar vah janata ko jhuthe sapane dikhaane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 The reality is that the public now knows their reality
 "kamalnath ne varsh 2014 ke chunaav se pehle bhaajapa dwaara kiye gaye vaadon kaa zikr karte hue kaha, "varsh 2014 main kisaanon kii aay badhaane ke liye unki upaj par laagat se 50 pratishat adhik daam dene kaa vaada karne vaale aaj varsh 2019 main paanch saal baad bhi kisaanon kii aay doguni karne ke liye 2022 tak kaa samay maang rahe hai
 Those claiming to end terrorism-naxalism through demonetisation are repeating these same things in the 2019 manifesto
 "kamalnath ne kaha he, "aaj jari bhaajapa ke sankalp-patr se ummid thi ki kisaanon ko karj ke daldal se nikaalane ke liye koi thos kaaryayojna yaa unhen karjmukt banane par baat hogi, lekin kisaanon ko karj se ubaarane ke liye koi thos kaaryayojna kaa abhaav is ghoshnaa-patr main dikhaa
 Whereas Congress has promised a separate budget and justice scheme for farmers
 "congress ke ghoshnaa-patr kaa zikr karte hue kamalnath ne kaha, "congress ne mahilaon ke shashaktikaran ke liye unhen 33 pratishat aarakshan dene kii baat kahi he
 However, there is nothing concrete about the upliftment of women in the BJP manifesto
 jiesti va notebandi se tabah ho chuke vyapaar-vyavsaay ko sankat se ubaarane ke liye koi thos kaaryayojna is sankalp-patr main nahin he
 This is a jumla patra in its entirety
 iske madhyam se janata ko jhuthe sapane dikhaakar gumraah karne kaa prayaas maatr he

 Under this, those holding Lumia will get a huge discount of up to 65 percent on the price of that handset

 Similarly, the company has also announced 10 to 50 percent discounts

 Later, when the matter arose in the media, Akhilesh had expressed his displeasure in the party forum about Mukhtar and in Aaj Tak's program Panchayat Aaj Tak made a clear announcement on June 25 that he would not take Mukhtar Ansari to the party at any cost
 iske baad akhilesh kii naaraazgi ko dekhte hue samaajawaadee party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main is vilay ko radd kar diya gaya tha
 We were cheated: Afzal Ansari was very angry about this and he then said that he has been cheated and he will tell Samajwadi Party its status in Purvanchal
 coma ekta dal ke do vidhayak hai mukhtaar ansaari or sibakataulla ansaari
 However, when we talked to Afzal Ansari about this, he said that he had spoken to Shivpal Singh Yadav recently, but there was no discussion about his return
 philhal wo pichley bees dinon se typhoid se peedit hai or aaj ilaaj ke liye dilli ja rahe hai
 Shivpal is angry to tell you that Shivpal was angry since the merger was canceled
 unhen manaane kii koshishen jari thim, lekin ravivaar ko mainpuri main shivpal ne kaaphi tikhe bol bole or kaha ki unki party ke dabang log jameen kabja karne or avaidh sharaab ke dhandhe me lipt hai
 Officers are corrupt and no one is listening to them
 agar aisa hi chalata rahaa to party se wo istipha de denge
 Mulayam Singh Yadav confirmed that Akhilesh will be reduced today, saying that Shivpal has submitted his resignation to him thrice, but each time he has stopped him
 mulaayam singh ne kaha ki agar shivpal yadav ne party chhod di to sarkaar kii aisi taisi ho jaaegi
 These statements of Mulayam clearly show that the policy decisions of the party will now be taken by Mulayam, Shivpal and Ram Gopal
 akhilesh kii bhoomika ab kamatar najar aegi
 There have been many videos in which police brutality has been recorded
 vah ekatarfa tareeqe se logon ke gharon main ghuskar maar rahi he
 Somebody is surrounded by police and he is being lathi-charged all around
 ek video main log ek duusare par gire pade hai or un par police berahami se laathiyaan barsaati ja rahi he
 What does it mean to kill someone when they are in a position to be caught? When someone is in the house and not committing violence there then what is the point of killing in the house? It is evident that the police is more interested in killing the poor
 uske paas kisi ko bhi updravi bataakar peetane kaa license he
 In many videos, the police are seen taking revenge
 vah aas paas kii sampattiyon ko nuqasaan pahunchaa rahi he
 The motorcycle parked there is breaking
 dukaane tod rahi he
 She is driving stones
 vahaan to chalaa hi rahi he jahaan us par pathar chale hai lekin vahaan bhi chalaate dikh rahi he jahaan saamne koi nahin he or police pathar maare ja rahi he
 There is no assessment of how much damage has been caused by the violence and sabotage of the police
 Only news has come from Jamia that property worth 2
5 crores has been damaged
 uniwarsity ke bheetar to shanti thi, librari main to hinsa nahin ho rahi thi? kya yogi adityanath yaa amit shah aise maamalon main bhi police kii sampatti nilaam kar logon ko harjaana denge?upi main saat log goli se mare hai
 The police says comfortably that if she did not shoot, then what was she doing there? He also has cameras, tell us where and how the bullet was moving
 Jamia Milia's violence has triggered three shots
 pehle police ne yah baat nahin bataai jab enditivi ne is khabar ko dikhaaya tab kai tarah kii theory di gai
 When the police got surrounded, it was said that people drove and they had indigenous kattas
 sochie aisa hota to police pehle hi din nahin bataati? apni hinsa ke samarthan main uske paas isse damdaar pramaan kya ho saktaa tha? phir jab video aayaa jisamen police hi goli chalaate dikh rahi he ki police or media chuppi maar gaya
 Obviously the media is more tolerant of police violence
 uski dilchaspee loktantr main hoti to in sawaalon ko pramukh banaati
 Each time saying that outsiders raise suspicion on the police's response to the violence
 kya police kii is hinsa ko nahin dikhaaya janaa chahie? aise anek video viral ho rahe hai magar media ko dikhaane ke dar se viral ho ja rahaa he
 Questions and videos related to police violence have been cleared from everywhere
 channelon par sirf logon kii hinsa ke vijual hai yaa khabaron kii pattee main sahi likhaa he ki bheed ne hinsa kii
 i am not saying that people do not commit violence
 wo hinsa kii sthiti paidaa nahin karte hai
 Absolutely do
 is maamle main log bhi doodh ke dhule nahin he lekin hinsa ke har maamle main yaa zyaadaatar maamle main police kii hinsa kam dikhaai jaati he
 Whatever it is, some people can be seen uncontrollable in some performances
 unke bich se pathar chalaae ja rahe hai
 Such people are making the atmosphere tense with their excitement
 wo apni gali main pathar chalaa kar duusare shaharon ke pradarshnon ko kamjor karte he
 The excitement of the people gives the police a chance to be alert and hyperactive in anticipation of something terrible
 ek video ahmedabad kaa aayaa he
 People have caught the police
 police par hinsa kar rahe hai
 But seven young men come out of the same crowd and save the police
 is video kii khub charchaa hui
 Both in the viral world and the media, but the video in which many policemen are raping sticks on a man is not discussed
 dariyaganj se do video gum rahe hai
 Policemen can be seen breaking bricks on the roof in it
 ek video raat kaa he jisamen gali main kisi ko gher kar maar rahe hai
 He is screaming, yet he is being killed
 jabaki agar wo hinsa kaa aaropee tha to aaraam se police bina maare pakad kar le ja sakati thi
 Some such videos from Mangalore are going viral in which the vandalism of the police is clearly visible
 jab saamne se hamalaa ho to police kii karrwai samaj aati he lekin jab koi javaabi hamalaa na ho tab galiyon or dukaanon main ghuskar qahar barapaane kaa tuk sirf or sirf logon ko aukaat main rakhana he
 Another video of Daryaganj is going viral in which the policemen are breaking the glass of the car with the poles
 vahaan log nahin hai
 People's car is parked and police are breaking
 kya vah kisi or ke mohalle main aisa karti? yahi dilli police he jo chupchaap tees hazari court se chali ai
 The lawyers had allegedly set the lockup on fire
 police waalon ko maaraa tha tab kya aapane dekha tha ki dilli police unke gharon or kamaron se khoj kar laa rahi he? unki gaadiyaan tod rahi he? to kya ham dilli police kaa sampradayik cheharaa dekh rahe hai?jo bhi he police ko hinsa kii chhot he
 In the name of self-defense, his violence is taken for granted
 video dekhe maton lagata he ki police maarane kii taiyaari main hi ai he
 Police are seen abusing in many videos
 logon ko sampradayik baaten kah rahi hai
 The girls in Jamia were called Jinnah's puppy
 bijepi ke ek netaa kehete hai ki dawa daalane par keede makode bilabila kar baahar aa rahe hai
 It should be understood that the language of the people who have control over such power
 to police ko aisi bhashaa bolne kii chhot milegi hi
 So would it be okay to hand over the demonstrations to violence? In my opinion, this cannot be a fad decision
 hinsa se kuch hasil nahin hoga
 Will have to back down from this
 logon ko bhi siikhnaa hoga ki jab pradarshan main jaaen to unka aacharan kaisaa ho, bhashaa kisi ho
 Otherwise, the police is sitting ready
 acchhee baat he ki kai jagahon par police ne shandaar kaam kiya
 Let people perform and people also performed in a manner
 yahi kaaran he ki zyaadaatar pradarshan shantipurna rahe hai
 People and police both deserve congratulations for this
 naagarikta register or kaanoon kaa virodh pradarshan netaa viheen he isliye hinsa se bachaana logon kii hi zimmedaari he
 Loss of life and property is not good
 hinsa hone par kisi ko koi insaaf nahin hota he
 There is only debate
 logon ko samajhnaa chahie kaanoon ban chukaa he
 NRC will arrive
 to yah maamla ek din kaa nahin he
 Those who are against it test their endurance and courage
 ek din ke liye daud lagaakar aa janaa aasaan hota he
 The government is also waiting that in two to four days it will be tired or that so many people will be killed by the police shot that the target of the protest will end
 hinsa mat hone dijie
 Do not and do not let
 loksabhaa chunaav ke aakhri charan ke matdaan se pehle bengal main chunavi ladaai jari he
 Seeing increasing political violence, the Election Commission has reduced the time of campaigning in Bengal, while Mamata Banerjee's close officers have also fallen heavily
 afasaron par gaaj girane ke baad mamata banerjee bhadak gayi or chunaav ayog ko khub khari-khoti sunai
 Actually, Mamta Banerjee did not get angry at the Election Commission
 darasal, jin adhikariyon ko hataaya gaya yaa phir shift kiya gaya he, unamem mamata banerjee ke khaas afasar bhi shaamil hai
 The Election Commission removed Bengal Principal Secretary (home) Atri Bhattacharya from the post
 iske saath hi siaidi ke ADG rajeev kumaar ko bhi unke pad se hataaya gaya
 Who is Rajiv Kumar? She is the same Rajiv Kumar whom Mamata Banerjee had sat on a dharna against the central government
 siaidi ke ADG banane se pehle vah kolkata police ke kamishnar the or unke ghar sibiai ne chapa maar diya tha
 Against this, Mamata Banerjee made a noise against the Modi government
 haalanki baad main supreme court tak maamla pahunchane or adaalat ke aadesh ke baad maamla thodaa sulajhaa or rajeev kumaar ko kamishnar pad se hataaya gaya
 After which he was appointed to the CID
 ab ek baar phir chunaav ayog ne rajeev kumaar ko siaidi pad se hi hataa diya he or waapas unhen grih mantralay bhej diya he
 That is, now he will work under the central government
 kanoon vyavastha par sidhaa waraiske alaava jin grih pradhan sachiv atri bhattacharya ko chuttee par bheja gaya he, vah bhi bengal sarkaar main badi haisiyat rakhte hai
 That is because the entire responsibility of the law and order of the state is on them and during the whole elections questions have been raised on the law and order
 bijepi puure chunaav main aarope lagaati rahi he ki mamata banerjee ke ishaare par hinsa ho rahi he or kanoon vyavastha lagaataar bigadati ja rahi he
 In such a situation, Bhattacharya has been hurt by the Election Commission
 chunaav ayog ke ection ke baad mamata banerjee ne ise galat karrwai bataaya or ise piem narendra modi ke ishaare par kii gai karrwai bataaya
 Let me tell you that now only three days are left for the last phase of the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin matdaan se pehle bengal chunavi akhaada ban gaya he
 There was a ruckus in the road show of BJP President Amit Shah and after that Mamta Banerjee accused him of violence
 maamla badhata dekh chunaav ayog ection main aayaa or usne prachaar kaa samay kam kar diya he

 Delhi Police will now be given plastic sticks to be used lightly and conveniently in place of its bamboo sticks
 plastic ke danda maanav sharir par padane par lathi kii apeksha kam dard pahunchaate hai
 a new police officer said, "this new stick made of polycarbonate, transparent, solid and almost non-breaking material, is light and easy to use and also reduces injury
" 'naam ujagar na karne kii shart par adhikari ne bataaya, 'chunki aise dandon kaa vajan kam he isliye unase kisi vyakti ko kam nuksaan pahonchega tathaa gambhir chot lagane kii sambhaavna nahin rahegi
 'remember that Delhi Police had to face a lot of criticism after the incident of a 51-year-old woman who was a supporter of Yogguru Baba Ramdev injured by police lathi in June 2011 at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi

 Apart from this, the police had to face criticism for using extra force on protesters protesting against the rape in December last year
 nyaayalay ne bhi police ko lathi chalaane par latad lagaai thi
 "hopefully, now such incidents will be prevented," said the official
 'police ke ek anya adhikari ne bataaya, 'plastic danda sabase pehle dilli sashastr police batalian ko die gaye hai tathaa nai dilli ke kuch pramukh ilaakon main jahaan adhiktar pradarshan hote hai, vahaan pulicekarmiyon ko plastic danda kaa prayog karne kaa nirdesh diya gaya he

 iske saath hi aaj hi din bachaav paksh (rahul gandhi) kaa bayaan bhi darj kiya jayega
 Although a hearing is held on the basis of a summary trial in such a case, Rahul Gandhi filed a petition last month requesting the summons trial (recorded statement)
 congress adhyaksh ke vakil narayan ayyar ne kaha tha ki yah maamla aitihaasik tathyon se sambandhit he, isliye unhen kai dastavejon kaa sahaara lenaa padegaa or visheshgyon ke bayaan darj karwaane honge

 If they do not express regret in this case, they will face trial in court

 There can be two ways to understand another knock of the global crisis at India's threshold: one is to head into the sand and wish that it is a global problem and we will somehow survive
 doosraa yah ki is sankat main avasaron kii talash shuru karen
 The Modi government has chosen another route, but wait, before you revisit the positivity of the government, we must examine the record and risk taking advantage of the opportunities given to this government, because this crisis is different than its predecessor
 And is going to leave a deep impact
 sirf share bazaar hi to the jo bharat main ummiido kii aguai kar rahe the
 After the crisis in China, the return of investors from emerging economies has also hit this peak of feel good for India, which stood at cheap foreign capital
 pichley do saal main bhartiya arthvyavastha main buniyadi taur par bahut kuch nahin badla
 With the preparations for the election, the stock markets climbed the ladder of expectations, making the pinnacle of height
 bharat ke aarthik sanketak naram-garam hi hai, mandi he, byaaj daren oonchi hai, jaruri chizon kii mahangaai maujuud he, maang nadaarad he, munafa or aay nahin bad rahi jabaki mausam kii berukhi bad gai he
 But the foreign exchange reserves are better, crude oil is cheaper and there is political stability
 duniya main sankat kii hawaaen pehle se thim
 With its huge property investment, recession and peculiar banking, China was moving towards this crisis since 2013
 bharat ke aarthik udaarikaran ke baad yah teesraa sankat he
 The currency crisis of East Asia in 1997 did not have a far-reaching impact on India
 2008 main america va europe main banking va karj sankat se bhi bharat kamobesh mahfuj rahaa
 Now China's trouble hangs on its head
 bharat is par mutmain ho saktaa he ki global uthal-puthal se ham par afat nahin fat padegi lekin yahi sankat bharat kii growth kii raftaar kaa bhavishya nirnaayak rup se tay kar degaa
 The last two crises gave India a mixed effect of profit and loss
 1997 main jab purvi asia ke pramukh deshon kii mudraaen pighalin to bharat kii par shuruaati asar hua lekin uske baad agle saat varsh tak bhartiya arthvyavastha ne growth ke sahare apana chola badal diya
 This was the result of major reforms that took place in the mid-nineties and benefited from direct investment and growth in the real economy
 tab tak bharat ke share bazaaron main sakriyata simit thi
 After the 2008 crisis, cheap capital flowed to the US as interest rates plummeted
 pichley chah saal ke sudhaaron ke kaaran ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon main ummiden jag gai thim
 This was the period when the BRICS economies shone and the Indian stock market became a pilgrimage for investors
 bhartiya arthvyavastha main spasht mandi ke baavjood yah nivesh haal tak jari rahaa jo chunaav ke bigul ke saath 2014 main shikhar par pahunch gaya tha
 It is important to understand the latest challenge and opportunity in the context of these facts
 chunauteeh bharat kii musiibat china kaa dhahna he hi nahin, na hi global mandi se bahut fark padaa he sivaa iske ki niryaat dhah gaya he, jo pehle se hi kamjor he
 The confusion is that as soon as interest rates rise in the US (likely this month) foreign investors will exit emerging markets, including India, where they came after 2008, as the return on investment will decline
 vaastavik arthvyavastha main growth nahin he isliye bhartiya companiyon kaa munafa lambey samay tak nivesh ko aakarshith nahin kar saktaa
 This is the first time in the last five years that experts are conveying a long decline in emerging markets including India
 dhyaan rahe ki videshi niveshak bharat ke liye dollaron kaa pramukh strot rahe hai isliye yah vidaai mahangi padegi
 This is the last light of Feel Good, which is now broken
 avasarh yadi samay, arthvyavastha ke aakaar or global arthvyavastha se judaav ko alag kar diya jaae to bharat 1995 kii sthiti main he jab jidipi main growth kii ummiden kamjor thim or share bazaaron main nivesh nahin tha
 However, all major structural reforms in India ranging from foreign trade, investment liberalization to privatization took place between 1995 and 2000, which benefited from the confidence of investors during global crises
 modi sarkaar nabbe kii dashak jaise bade dhanchaagat sudhaar kar bhartiya growth ko agle ek dashak kaa eendhan de sakati he
 The Finance Minister is right that the real economy is on the real economy
 ab share bazaar bhi companiyon kii takat or vaastavik growth par gati karenge na ki sasti videshi puunji par
 After this crisis, India has two options: first, a reform-free 6
 5-7 fisadi kii ausat vikaas dar jise aap 21veen sadi kii hindu growth rate kah sakate hai
 Growth will not go down (except for drought etc
 crises) on the basis of large consumption and some global demand
 doosraa, nau-das fisadi kii growth or rojgaron, suvidhaon, aay main badhottaree kaa he jo 1997 ke baad hui thi
 After the knock of the global crisis on the stock markets, on 8 September, when the Prime Minister was giving advice to the industries to take risks with full fervor, the entrepreneurs would surely want to say that the government needs you to show courage! In the last 15 months, no courage has been shown for reforms
 america main byaaj daren badaae ke baad sankat ke jatke tej honge
 The next one year will tell whether we are going to get the Hindu growth rate of the 21st century or a fast flight of progress

 Later all the household members dine together and pray for the peace of the ancestors' souls

 What to do on the omnipotent Amavasya - According to the scriptures, our ancestors are happy by serving and worshiping people

 mika singh bollywood ke mashhoor singrs main se ek hai
 These days a video of Micah Singh is becoming increasingly viral on social media
 is video ke viral hone kii vajah mika singh kii damdaar parformens nahin, unke parform karne kii jagah he
 Actually, Micah Singh is seen giving his performance in a special event in Karachi city of Pakistan
 bharat-pakistan ke bich in dinon tanaav kaaphi bad gaya he
 After the ban of India, Pakistan has also banned Indian artists
 aise main singer mika singh kaa karachi jaakar concert karnaa charchaa main bana hua he
 Pakistani singer Fakir Mehmood has shared a video of Micah on social media, writing, Kashmir is completely locked down
 lekin ek indian singer aata he, parform karata he, paise kamata he or chalaa jaataa he jaise ki kuch hua hi nahin
 But religion and patriotism are only for the poor
 Kashmir remains in complete lockdown but as free country we can do what we like
 Why not an Indian singer come, perform here, earns tax free $$$ and leave as did one yesterday
 But of course, religion and patriotism is for the poor

 com / ncpuqtxlnx— 🅰 Jan Kakar 🇵🇰 (@officialajan) August 10, 2019 Pakistan is shocked after the Modi government removed Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistan ne samjhauta express rokane ke saath hi bollywood filmon par bain laga diya he
 Recently, Pakistan Prime Minister's Special Information Advisor Firdaus Ashiq Awan issued a statement saying, "no Indian film will be screened in Pakistan
" unhone kaha ki bhartiya parampara ko dikhaane vaale kisi bhi tarah ke content par roak lagaai gai he
 However, after the incident in Jammu and Kashmir this year, the filmmakers of India had decided on their own that they would not screen films in Pakistan
 kai nirmaataaon ne pakistan main filmein relies nahin karne kii ghoshnaa bhi kii thi
 Not only this, angry with the terrorist attack on Balakot, the film industry also appealed not to take Pakistani actors in their films
 bihar ke begusarai jila ke barauni thana antargat milky gaanv main shuukravaar raat ek maovadi dwaara apane ek anya saathi kii goli markar hatya karne par graminon ne goli maarane vaale maovadi ko peet-petakar maar daalaa
 Superintendent of Police Chhatranil Singh said here on Saturday that the deceased Maoists include Sikandar Tanti and Paltan Tanti
 police ne donon maovadiyon ke shavon ko apane kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye jila sadar aspataal bhej diya he
 He said that the villagers were beaten to death by capturing the running platoon by the villagers when Alexander Tanti was shot by his companion Paltan Tanti
 singh ne bataaya ki in donon maovadiyon ke bich ek kisaan ke 12 bighaa ke ek bhukhand ko jotane ko lekar lambey samay se vivaad chalaa aa rahaa tha or unke khilaaf ek hatya evam do amrs act ke maamle purv se lambit hai
 Former BCCI secretary Sanjay Jagdale on Thursday expressed surprise over Rajasthan Royals co-owner Raj Kundra's acceptance of betting in IPL matches and said it had given a further boost to the fans' confidence in the game
 kundra se poochtacha karne vaali dilli police ne daawa kiya ki kundra ne sattebaaji kii baat sweekaar kii he balki unhone aisa karte hue kaaphi dhan bhi ganvaaya
 Jagdale, who recently resigned from the BCCI post, said, "betting is morally wrong because you own a team
" aisi chijen cricket ke liye acchhee nahin he or na hi ipel ke liye
 This is another incident to end the trust of Indian cricket lovers on this game
 yah sachmuch hairaan karne vaala he
 '' yah poochne par ki agar kundra ke khilaaf sattebaaji ke aarope sabit ho jate hai to kya rajasthan rails ko nilambit kiya ja saktaa he to jagadale ne kaha ki yah faisla ipel adhikariyon par nirbhar karata he
 Jagdale said, "I cannot comment on legal things
" yah (rajasthan royles ke bhagya par faisla karnaa) sanchaalan parishad or kaaryakari samiti par nirbhar karata he
 He said that now the time has come that the BCCI should take a lesson from these controversies and clean the system rapidly
 jagadale ne kaha, ‘‘bisisiai ko ye sabak lene honge
 The sooner this happens, the better

 ’’ The Delhi Police, who interrogated Kundra, claimed that Kundra accepted the betting but also lost a lot of money while doing so

 This is really surprising
 ’’ Asked if Rajasthan Royals can be suspended if betting charges against Kundra are proved, Jagdale said that the decision depends on the IPL officials
 jagadale ne kaha, ‘‘main kanoonee chizon par tippanee nahin kar saktaa
 It depends on the Governing Council and the Executive Committee (deciding the fate of Rajasthan Royals)
 ’’ unhone kaha ki ab samay aa gaya he ki bisisiai ko in vivaadon se sabak lekar teji se vyavastha ko saaf suthra karnaa chahie
 Jagdale said, "BCCI has to take these lessons

 dilli se rukhsat hone se thik pehle agxcutive editor damayanti datta ke saath unki baatcheet ke anshavvida hote vakt aapako afsos he, yaa gussa yaa raahat?na to afsos he, na gussa
 i paid my duty and i am leaving
 bas
 You were the only judge to express disagreement in the 2015 decision on NJAC (national Judicial Appointments Commission)
 kya aaj bhi aapkaa vahi rukh hota?haa, ab bhi, thik unheen aadhaaron par, engeesi kaa samarthan karata hum
 It is one thing to say that the structure is unconstitutional and another to say that the manner in which it is being run is wrong
 meri akeli shikaayat yah thi ki is vyavastha ko sahi tareeke se nahin chalaaya ja rahaa tha
 The important thing about your tenure as a Supreme Court justice was to protest against the way the court functions
 kya isse fark padaa?main ise virodh jaahir karnaa nahin kahuunga
 i raised some questions related to the institution
 or main maanata hum ki un sawaalon ko uthaane kaa vyavastha par kuch fark jarur padaa
 In our history, the differences within the Supreme Court have never come out in the public domain as openly as in your tenure
 kaam karnaa, khaskar janvari kii press conference ke baad kaam karnaa kitna aasaan yaa mushkil tha?mujhe koi mushkil nahin hui
 i have never had any personal issues with anyone
 maine sanstha se jude kuch nishchit sawaal uthaae
 After that i sat in court as usual and gave decisions on matters with the same competence or ineptitude that i used to work before
 isse mujh par koi fark nahin padaa
 Taking a stand and then insisting on it is a legitimate democratic right or not? i have always done this
 masalan, main hameshaa maanata aayaa hum ki jajon par kanoonee sevaaon kaa boj nahin daalana chahie
 However, this is the law that Parliament has made
 meraa isamen yakeen nahin tha or maine hissaa lene se inkaar kar diya—hycourt kaa sabase varisht jaj hone ke naate khud ko ricus (alag) kar liya
 Even in the Supreme Court, i refused to participate in it
 lekin press conference main aapane jo mudde uthaae, unamem jaraa bhi sudhaar aayaa?nahin, jo mudde hamane uthaae, unhen puri tarah hal nahin kiya gaya
 It has been launched
 aapane pradhan nyaayadhish ke chuninda taur par maamle saunpane kaa virodh kiya
 Was that resolved? No comment
 supreme court ke jajon kii niyukti ke liye memorondom of proscisger (emopi) kaa sarkaar ne abhi tak koi jawaab nahin diya he
 What does this mean in terms of constitution? The order of the constitutional bench is that the government must take a final decision on the memorandum
 agar sarkaar koi faisla nahin leti he, to iskaa matlab he ki vah sanvaidhanik peeth ke aadesh ke mutabik nahin chal rahi he
 Are you satisfied with the way Judge Loya handled the case? The case is sub judice
 is par kuch bhi kahana behad galat hoga
 Do you want me to go to jail? This year there was a demand for impeachment against the current CJI
 magar aapane kaha he ki mahabhiyog koi samaadhaan nahin ho saktaa? to samaadhaan kya he?mahabhiyog rajnatik prakriya he
 In a judgment in Justice Karnan's case, we had said that impeachment cannot solve all the issues of the judiciary
 vyavastha main bhatkaav hai
 And a judge may have a variety of unacceptable activities
 ferj kiijie, ek khaas jaj bhrasht he, to doosraa aalsee he, ek tisare jaj ko kanoon kii katai koi jaankaree nahin he
 Impeachment cannot be the answer to everything
 badakismati se samvidhan saaf taur par nahin bataata ki kya karnaa chahie
 In this case either the law should be made or it should be decided at the level of judiciary
 koi na koi vyavastha to viksit kerani hi hogi
 The judiciary is a constantly changing institution
 hamen ummid kerani chahie ki jajon kii agali peedi in masalon par bahes karegi or inase nibategi
 In your letter to the CJI in March 2018, you cited two legal luminaries, Lord Bingham and Justice Robert Jackson, and described any interaction between the judiciary and the government as the death knell for democracy
 kya yah aaj aapaki sabase badi chintaaon main se ek he?yah hameshaa badi chintaa kaa vishay rahaa he
 The need in a democratic society is that the functioning of the judiciary should be completely independent
 jo bhi cheez is swatantraaa ko kamjor karti he, vah is sanstha kii saakh ke liye nuksandaayak hi ho sakati he
 Recently there have been cases in which the government ignored the instructions of the collegium in the appointment of judges
 kya aisa pehle bhi hua he?haa, pehle bhi hua he
 On several occasions, the governments of the time ignored the recommendations of the collegium
 asal main 1993 kaa second jaj cese isi silsile kii pratikriya tha
 This confrontation between the executive and the judiciary has been going on for a long time
 iskaa koi samaadhaan kyon nahin nikal paata?janvari kii press conference abhootpurv ghatana thi
 We ourselves call it non-trivial
 lekin karypalika or nyaaypalika ke bich takaraav lagaataar chalane vaali prakriya he
 Think of the 1970s, when a fourth judge was made the Chief Justice, bypassing three judges of the Supreme Court
 kya vah takaraav nahin tha? aise takaraav hameshaa chalate rahenge, keval hamaare desh main hi nahin, balki harek loktantric desh main
 This is because any government would ultimately like to have every possible control
 thik isi samaj se to samvidhan banaae jate hai or unamem aise suspasht praavdhaan kiye jate hai jo kehete hai ki nyaaypalika ko swatantra rahanaa hi chahie
 The framers of the constitution, whether they are from our country or from other countries, do not have any people who just go through it and prepare a legal document
 ve gyani log hai, ve maanav jati kaa, mulkon kaa itihaas jaanate hai, pehle kya hua tha, nyaaypalika ko kaabo main rakhane ke liye sarkarein kis kism kii koshishen karengi
 And these efforts will always go on
 satta kii yahi fitrat he
 Recall that famous act of Lord Acton, "power corrupts
 '' takaraav kya shakl akhriyaar karegaa, yah is par nirbhar karegaa ki sansthaaen loktantric taur par kitni sughadh hai or civil socitiyaan kitni samajhadaar hai
 The Supreme Court of India is often called the most powerful court in the world
 kya aap maanate hai?main yah nahin maanata
 The strength of any court ultimately depends on the extent to which the executive abides by the rule of law
 grih yudhon ke dauraan america itihaas kaa vah mashhoor prasang yaad kiijie jab supreme court ne bandi pratyakshikaran (habiyas corpus) aadesh jari kiya tha or linkan kii sarkaar ne use maanane se inkaar kar diya tha
 What could the Supreme Court do on this? Everything depends on mutual respect between the executive, the judiciary and the various parts of the democratic set up according to the instructions of the Constitution
 jaankaar kah rahe hai ki aapke ritair hone ke saath hi collegium main nyaayik niyuktiyon par chal rahe takaraav ke bich, uske kaamkaaj kii rakrataar or disha badal jaaegi
 Would that mean a coffin nail for the collegium? i don't think so
 agar yah aisi vyavastha he jiske ek jaj ke ritair hone ke saath khatm hone kii ashanka he, to yah kharaab vyavastha he
 i am sure that my comrades will live up to the oath they have taken and will protect the Constitution
 kaarykaal kii kis baat se sabase zyada santosh mila he?main hindustan ke loktantric samvidhan kii karypranali main kuch bhoomika adaa kar sakaa
 How successful i am is a matter of opinion and assessment
 log isamen keval masala khojate hai, janvari kii press conference, vagairah-vagairah
 But in terms of jurisprudence, the important thing is that i got a chance to serve the nation as a judge for 21 years
 12 janvari to iskaa chota-sa pahalu he
 What values made you who you are? i have been convinced in two things: Democracy is the best style of governance
 or iskaa matlab asahmatiyon kaa sakvamaan karnaa he
 i may not agree with you, but i respect your right to disagree

 The 'clean jharkhand-healthy Jharkhand' resolution being run by the Jharkhand government has received a setback from the local legislators

 Nominal toilets have been constructed in the state in the last three years from the MLA fund, while each public representative has to spend fifty lakh rupees every year towards the construction of toilets in his constituency
 beete vittiya varsh 12 jilon main vidhayak nidhi se ek bhi iechaechael kaa nirmaan nahin kiya gaya
 These figures are sad and also thoughtful
 sarkaar ke aankade bayaan kar rahe halatraajya sarkaar ke peyajal evam swatchta vibhaag kii report bataati he ki rajya bhar main vittiya varsh 2016-17 main vidhayak nidhi se mahaj 3590 vyaktigat shauchalayon kaa nirmaan karaayaa gaya he
 At the same time, the saddest aspect of it is that the representatives of the 12 districts of the state have not given even one rupee from the MLA fund under this head
 asal main ye aankade vaise to 2 march 2016 tak ke hai, lekin aaj tak isamen isamen koi khaas badlaav nahin aayaa he
 Legislators' interest was seen more in communal toilets than on individual family toilets
 mili 41 karod kharch kiye mahaj chaar karodrajya main is vaqt ek manonith vidhayak samet 82 vidhayak hai
 In this context, these public representatives get 40 to their MLA funds for constructing toilets every year
 50 karod rupee muhaiyaa karaane hote hai
 It is worth noting that the cost of construction of such a toilet comes to Rs
 12000
 is lihaaj se mananeeyon ne shauchalay nirmaan ke mad main mahaj 4
 Spent only 30 crores rupees
 yah aankade is mad main mili raashi kaa das fisad bhi nahin hai
 In such a situation, honorable people could build 33000 toilets every year only with their own funds, whereas only 3590 were built
 inamen se bhi 12 jilon main vidhayak nidhi se ek bhi vyaktigat shauchalay nahin bana
 These districts are Deoghar, Dhanbad, Dumka, Giridih, Jamtara, Koderma, Lohardaga, Pakur and saraikela-kharsawan, Sahibganj, East Singhbhum and West Singhbhum

 However, the two sides agreed on the issue of finding a "amicable solution" to the land and maritime boundary in the disputed area
 vaarta ke baad jari sanyukt bayaan main kaha gaya, ‘donon pakshon ne sar creek ilaake main bhoomi seemaa or bharat evam pakistan ke madhya antarrashtriya samudri seemaa ke simakan par charchaa kii
 The statement said, "the two sides committed to seek a amicable solution to the Sir Creek issue through continuous and positive dialogue
" ’vaarta main bhartiya paksh kaa netritv mahasarveykshak swarna subba raav, jabaki pakistani paksh kaa netritv raksha mantralay main atirikt sachiv rier admiral farrukh ahamed ne kiya

 ullekhneey he ki sar creek masale par charchaa siachin glacier par pichley saptaah hui vaarta ke baad hui he
 These talks are part of the agreement reached by the two countries on starting the dialogue process
 pichley saal farvari main donon deshon ne vaarta prakriya shuru karne par sahmati jataai thi
 The United Nations, Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom, the 5 strongest countries of the world, were included in the Security Council of the United Nations, which came into existence after World War II
 in deshon ko pi-5 (permanent Five) bhi kaha jaataa he
 India has been struggling to join this elite club for a long time
 takneekee rup se uski daavedaari banati bhi he or pi-5 ke hi zyaadaatar desh khuleam ise sweekaar bhi chuke hai
 The question arising is whether the prevailing global conditions are most favorable for India to be included as a P-6 in the Security Council? For the past several decades, there has been a demand for expansion of the Security Council worldwide and India is in the forefront of this race
 aazaadee se pehle hi bharat ne bataur founding member 1 janvari 1942 ko sanyukt raashtra ko astitv main laane ke liye washington decleration par hastakshar kiye or vishwa shanti ke sabhi prayaason main ahm bhoomika adaa karne kii sahmati di
 India's first representative to the United Nations was Sir A
 Ramaswamy Mudaliar
 maujuuda pi-5 sadsy aarthik or sainya shakti hone ke saath-saath dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad sthapit hone vaali duniya ke aise desh the jinhen sanyukt raashtra ne tisare vishwa yuddh kii sambhaavnaaon ko khatm karne kii jimmedaari di
 At the time of the creation of the United Nations, the four countries, except China, were in the winning group of World War II, and being a major economic and military power, they determined their major activity in establishing world peace
 aazaadee ke baad pehali baar bharat sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kaa asthaayee sadsy 1950-51 main bana
 The Security Council has 10 non-permanent members in addition to the P-5 and member countries elect them for two years
 aazaadee ke teen saal baad hi asthaayee sadsy bana bharat abtak 7 baar suraksha parishad main shaamil ho chukaa he (1950-51, 1967-68, 1972-73, 1977-78, 1984-85, 1991-92 or 2011-12)
 Trade deficit from China is bringing America and India together? Despite this role in the Security Council, for the first time in 1971, India lacked a permanent member in the Security Council
 is vakt bharat ne bangladesh ko pakistan se aaazaad karaane main ahm bhoomika adaa kii
 Despite this, the world's largest democracy, India was challenged by the oldest and most powerful democracy America
 america ne pakistan ke paksh main khadey hote hue apni nausena ke sabase shaktishaalee saatven flit ke ladaaku vimaanon se las yudhpot enterprise ko hind mahaasaagar main pakistan kii madad ke liye ravaanaa kar diya
 At the same time, the then US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger called India a reason for war in the war for Bangladesh's independence
 haalanki, suraksha parishad main pi-5 sadasyon ke is prahaar se bharat ko bachaane kaa kaam tatkaaleen soviet sangh (rus) ne kiya, jisane apane vito power kaa istemaal karte hue bharat ke khilaaf america kadam ko roak diya
 Although this incident is now history, but from here the race to join the Security Council of India started
 suraksha parishad kii is daud main bharat kii purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne teen baar (1972-73, 1977-78, 1984-85) desh ko suraksha parishad main asthaayee seat dilaai
 After this, former Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh brought India to the Security Council for the sixth time in 1991-92 and then the former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for the seventh time in 2011-12
 asthaayee seat ke liye hue in sabhi prayaason ke jariye suraksha parishad main sthaayee seat kii bharat kii prabal daavedaari pesh hui
 Due to these efforts over the past decades, four of the five permanent members of the United States, the United States, Russia, France and the United Kingdom are ready to make India P-6, but China continues to oppose it
 suraksha parishad ke alaava sanyukt raashtra kii mahasabha main bhi bharat kii sadsyta kaa virodh karne ke liye china ke samarthan se kukhyat ‘coffee club’ (uniting for Consensus) sakriy he
 The club includes Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Italy, Malta, Mexico, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, San Marino, Spain and Turkey
 bharat ke saath-saath ye coffee club suraksha parishad ke kisi vistaar kaa virodh kar rahaa he
 Modi's masterstroke: It is a priority for the Bharatiya Janata Party, which holds power at the Center, to place India in the Security Council
 party ne apane menifesto main bharat ko sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kaa sthaayee sadsy banane kaa vaada darj kar rakhaa he
 With this, PM Modi did not miss an opportunity to take an edge on this priority during his visit to nearly 100 countries
 25 sitambar 2015 ko sanyukt raashtra aam sabha ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne suraksha parishad ko 21veen sadi kii chunautiyon ke mutabik badalane ke saath bharat ko suraksha parishad main sakriy bhoomika die jane kaa aahvaan kiya
 While four members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, France and the United Kingdom have been advocating for the inclusion of India from time to time, there has been some easing in the attitude of the Chinese who have always sat in protest
 sitambar 2014 main china ke raashtrapati shi jinping ke bharat daure ke baad bhartiya videsh mantralay kii taraf se bayaan jari kar kaha gaya ki china sarkaar suraksha parishad main bharat ko jagah die jane kaa samarthan karti he
 With this, it was said that the Chinese government believes that at present, India has an important role at the international level
 baharhaal, videsh mantralay ke is bayaan se itar china se kootnithik str par abhi bhi is sambandh main badi uplabdhi hasil karnaa he
 Recently, the way India has pushed China into its One Belt One Road project, it has clearly indicated to China that the success of any of its major projects will be decided only when India stands in favor of that project
 america raashtrapati donald trump kii nitiyon ke chalate shuru hue trade war main china ko america ke khilaaf bharat kii zyada samarthan kii darkaar he
 In such a situation, there are better opportunities than ever for India to put China on the negotiating table and persuade them to a seat in the Security Council
 ab sanyukt raashtra ke manch par vaastavik raajnneeti ke mutabik bharat ko sthaayee sadsyta tabhi mil sakati he jab paanchon sthaayee sadsy desh bharat ke paksh main khadey hon
 Not only this, at least one country in these five countries should be such that it plays an important role among the member countries in the General Assembly for India's claim
 aisi sthiti main jahaan coffee club kii gatividhiyon ko niskriy karne main madad milegi vahiin bharat kii suraksha parishad main entry kaa rasta saaf ho sakegaa

 They are conniving as a pioneer of truth in an aggressive manner
 lekin ab tak ke unke vyavhaar or kaam karne kii style se aisa kuch nahin lagata ki jo chamatkaar unhone vidhansabha chunaav main kar dikhaaya vah loksabhaa ke is mahatvapurn chunaav main bhi kar sakenge
 All the hopes he raised while forming the government have been defeated
 sasti bijli or pani dilaane kaa unka vaada adhuraa rahaa or bhrashtachar mitaane kii baat to abhi shuru hui thim to unhone istipha de diya
 Raising issues and leaving them in the middle has been Kejriwal's habit
 unhone dilli waalon ko jo vaade kiye usase shaayad mumbai ke log to prabhavit dikhte hai lekin uske aage unke prashansakon kii taadaad bahut hi kam he
 In such a situation, what his party will be able to do in the Lok Sabha elections, it is too early to say
 unke paas na to puure desh main kaaryakarta hai or na hi utana bada chintan
 In such a situation, he will wear his anti-corruption chola and try to win the election from that

 Kejriwal has dialed an incorrect number by raising such a finger on him
 vah modi kii lokapriyata yaa jise ve marketing kehete hai, se ghabaraae hue hai
 His nervousness is clearly visible and so on the lines of 'his shirt my shirt is white', he is also throwing mud at Modi
 lekin modi is jang main agali qatari ke nayakon main ja baithe hai or ek kushal senanayake kii tarah apni chaalen chal rahe hai
 He has been campaigning fast to increase public support, in which Congress's Mahabali Rahul Gandhi is also seen lagging behind
 rahul gandhi beshak acchhee bhaawanaaon se labarej hokar bhrashtachar dur karne ke vaade ke saath maidan main utre hai lekin unke paas kehane ko kuch nahin he
 His party has not given him something on the basis of which he should win the war
 ve puri tarah se baikfoot par dikhte hai
 The parts of the party which is more than 150 years old are shaken at the moment
 rahul gandhi narendra modi kii tarah raajnneeti ke chatur or chapal khilaadi nahin hai
 He is known for his straight talk but now there is very little time left for him
 sabase badi baat yah he ki unki party ne hi unhen nicha dikhaane main koi kasar nahin chodi he
 Only time will tell how successful they will be in removing the party from the specter of 2G scam, Colgate, etc
 modi unki kamajoriyon ko pahchaan kar ek behatar bharat kaa sapana dikhaa rahe hai or unke saamne abhi koi nahin dikh rahaa he
 However, it is too early to say anything, it would be wrong
 abhi to sirf itnaa kaha ja saktaa he ki modi ek sadhe hue ghudsavaar kii tarah sarapat bhaage ja rahe hai or unhen chunauti dene vaale abhi peeche hai

 Hitesh Varu, president of the Chhattisgarh Youth Progressive Farmers Association, said that the price has come down due to the huge yield of vegetables in the last few days
 rajya main tamaato, shimla mirch, kelaa, mirch or bandgobhi samet anek subjiyon ke daam gir gaye hai

 iske tahat modi sabase pehle jammu kashmir ke kathua main bharat vijay raily ko sambodhit karenge
 Modi has reached the stage at the rally venue in Kathua after seeing Mata Vaishno Devi
 manch se modi ne kaha ki main aapako sar jhukaakar naman karata hum
 Your love will give me a lot of strength
 modi ne kaha ki aaj maine mata vaishno devi ke darbar main jaakar sar jhukaaya
 Terrorists not only killed humans, they attacked Kashmir, attacked humanity
 modi ne kaha ki jammu kashmir main hawa kaa rukh hamaari taraf he
 i have come to the earth where martyrdom happens for the unity and integrity of the country
 is raily kaa naam he bharat vijay raily
 When we say Bharat Vijay Rally, it means victory over unemployment, victory over every difficulty
 modi ne kaha ki hamen shanti chahie, sadbhaav chahie kyonki hamen aage badhanaa he
 Tell me what you got by promoting dynastic politics
 secularism ke khokhale vaade kiye jate hai
 At a rally in Hiranagar, Kathua, Modi said that i say erase inflation, give employment, then they say talk about secularism
 upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal main javaanon ke sar kaate ja rahe hai
 Modi said what happened to the slogan Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan
 ab congress kahati he mar jawan, mar kisaan
 This has become the new slogan of the Congress
 bangladesh se aae logon ko to naagarikta mil gai, lekin paak se chaar dashak se aae logon ko naagarikta nahin mili
 After all, why did the government not give citizenship to people from Pakistan? modi ne kaha ki AK 47, eke antni or eke 49 kejariwal ne kashmir pakistan ko de diya

 bharat vijay raily ke jariye bijepi votaron se sidhe judane kii koshish main juty he
 BSP chief Mayawati has distanced herself from the alliance by saying that the sp's vote was not transferred to her in the Lok Sabha elections
 jisase gathbandhan kaa koi phayda nahin hua or ab unki party upachunaav apane dam par ladegi
 But the vote share figures in the Lok Sabha elections are a different testimony
 80 main se jin 15 siton par gathbandhan ko jeet mili, vahaan 2019 or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan sapa-basapa ke vot share kii tulana karne par pataa chalata he ki ek seat ko chhodkar sabhi 14 siton par donon dalon ke vot ek duusare ko transfar hue
 Only then did the alliance manage to save 15 seats in the Modi wave
 vot share ko dekhen to mayawati ke daawey ke ulat sapa ko jahaan mainpuri seat par nuksaan ho gaya, vahiin kannauj seat par bhi use basapa kaa puraa vot nahin mila
 This time in the Lok Sabha elections, BSP and SP contested 38 and 37 seats respectively
 jisamen se basapa 38 main se 10 jeetne main safal rahi
 The sp's 2014 vote share has been added to the bsp's ten seats it has won
 isi tarah sapa kii paanch main se chaar siton par basapa kaa 2014 vaala vot share judaa he
 a SP leader says that if there was no vote share then how the BSP won minus 10 seats
 ghaataa to sapa kaa hi hua, jo paanch kii paanch sito tak hi simit rahi
 These are the proofs of transfer of vote to BSP, in the Lok Sabha elections of 2019, the BSP has a total of 51 in Ghazipur
 2 pratishat vot share ke saath jeet hasil kii
 Whereas in 2014 the bsp's vote share was just 27
 82 tha
 The sp's vote share is 24
 49 pratishat tha
 Thus, the bsp's 22 seats compared to 2014 on this seat
 26 pratishat vot share zyada badha
 It is obvious that this vote must have shifted from the SP itself
 misaal ke taur par bijanour seat ko lijie
 BSP also won here
 2014 main basapa ko sirf 26
 51 percent vote share, while 50 in 2019
 97 pratishat vot share rahaa
 Which means 24 in the bsp's vote share
 46 pratishat kaa oochaal rahaa
 This surge came only after the sp's vote was added
 isi tarah jonpur seat dekhen to yahaan bhi basapa sapa ke vot share ke dam par jeetne main safal rahi
 In 2014, the BSP had a vote share of 17
 87 pratishat or sapa kaa 21
 93 percent
 jabaki 2019 main gathbandhan ko 50
 08 percent vote share
 is prakaar dekhen to basapa ne gathbandhan ke dam par yahaan 2014 ke mukaable apane vot share ko 32
 Was successful in raising 21 percent
 isi tarah lalganj main 54
 The BSP won the seat by securing 01 percent vote share
 jabaki 2014 main yahaan basapa kaa vot share sirf 29
 Was 04 percent
 shravasti main basapa ko 2014 ke 26
 44 against 55 percent
 31 pratishat vot mila, vahiin ambedkar nagar, amroha , nagina or saharanpur loksabhaa seat par bhi sapa ke voton ke dam par basapa ne jeet hasil kii
 If the SP did not get the votes, then how could the BSP have won these 10 seats alone? The game of the SP won in Mainpuri, Mainpuri was the only seat where it won without the bsp's vote share
 chaunkaane vaali baat rahi ki is seat par sapa ko apana bhi vot kam mila
 59 when Mulayam Singh Yadav fought in Mainpuri in 2014
 64 pratishat vot share sapa ko mila tha, jabaki basapa kaa vot share 14
 Was 29 percent
 is prakaar dekhe to 2014 main donon dalon kaa vot share kul milakar 73
 Was 93 percent
 magar 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa ko sirf 53
 Got 75 percent of the vote
 jabaki 2014 main akele sapa ko 59
 64 percent votes were received
 yani basapa ke vot kii baat hi chhodie, sapa ko pichhali baar kii tulana main khud apana hi 5
 Got 89 percent less votes
 azamgarh main sapa ko basapa kaa vot transfar hua
 The last time Mulayam Singh Yadav fought was 35
 44 pratishat vot share ke saath 340306 vot paakar jeet hasil kii thi
 But this time Akhilesh Yadav 60
 4 pratishat vot share or 621578 vot hasil kar jeet hasil kii
 24 to the account of SP
 96 pratishat vot share judaa
 bsp's 27 in 2014
 76 pratishat vot tha
 In this way, the vote was also transferred here
 samaajawaadee party kii siton kii baat karen to kul paanch siten milin
 If we talk about Moradabad, then 66 percent votes were cast
 pichhali baar samaajawaadee party ko 35
 The vote share was 26 percent
 is baar gathbandhan ko 50
 65 percent
 pichhali baar basapa kaa vot share yahaan 14
 27 percent
 is prakaar dekhen to 2014 main sapa-basapa kaa vot share 49
 Was 53 percent
 jabaki 2010 main 50
 65 percent
 yani muradabad main donon dalon ke voters ne vot kiye
 sp's vote share of 35 in 2014 in Rampur
 05 or basapa kaa vot share 8
 47 remained
 is prakaar dekhen to 2014 main sapa-basapa kaa vot share 43
 52 percent remained
 jabaki 2019 main 52
 71 remained
 jisase pataa chalata he ki rampur main bhi vot or transfar hue
 The entire BSP vote data of Dimple not found in Kannauj shows that though Akhilesh's wife Dimple Yadav may have won more votes this time in Kannauj, he did not get full BSP vote
 jisase haar gayi
 In 2014, Dimple received 4,89164 votes and BSP 1,27785 votes
 is prakaar 2014 main sapa or basapa kaa kul vot 6,16,949 hota he
 Whereas Dimple Yadav got 550,734 votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 yani gathbandhan ke baad dimple yadav sirf 61,788 vot hi zyada jod pain
 While the BSP got 1 in 2014
 27 lakh se zyada vot mili the
 At the same time, BJP candidate Subrata Pathak won the 2014 vote by reaching 4630257 votes to 563087
 kaha ja rahaa he ki basapa kaa aadha vot sapa ko mila or aadha gaiyr jatav dalit vaala vot bijepi main chalaa gaya

 ayog ne kaha ki yojana ke vivaran ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ayog kii yah raay he ki uparokt ghoshnaa se bachaa ja saktaa tha
 Therefore, the Commission expresses concern over such declaration and hopes that such declarations should be avoided during the operation of the Election Code of Conduct

 ayog ne cabinet sachiv ko patr likhakar ayog ke faisle se avgat karaayaa

 In this current case also, the concern of the Commission was limited to these issues only
