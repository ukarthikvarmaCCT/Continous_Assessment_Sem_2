 The railway is fully responsible for the kalinga-utkal Express train accident in Muzaffarnagar! Railway hands are stained with the death of more than 20 people and the blood of 70 injured
 ghatnasthal par maujuud pratyakshdarshiyon ke mutabik trek par kaam chal rahaa tha
 Track repair equipment has been recovered from the scene
 patariyaan kati hui hai or railway train haadase main aatankiyon ke haath dhundh rahaa he
 There have been rail accidents at regular intervals in Uttar Pradesh for some time
 or har haadase main rail mantralay aatanki sajeesh kaa shaq jataata rahaa he
 The attitude of the Ministry of Railways is worrying which gives rise to many questions
 1
 The work was going on on the track, the railway was responsible for the accident! According to intelligence sources, repair work was going on on the track at Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar
 ghatnasthal se hathode, rinch or anya aujaar mili hai
 The tracks are cut
 phir train ko ukt trek par jane kyon diya gaya? kya railway ne jaanboojhkar is haadase ko anjaam diya?utkal express train haadase par kya kehete hai chashmadid2
 Railway has communication gap? The question is that if the repair work was going on the track then why did the signalman give green signal to the kalinga-utkal Express to go on the track
 kya use pataa nahin tha ki trek par marammat kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 UP ATS DSP Anoop Singh has also confirmed that some work was going on at the place of the incident
 par train ko is jagah dhire hone ke liye koi signal nahin mila
 So far in investigation it has been revealed
 ATS kaa ek consteble bhi isi train main safar kar rahaa tha
 He has also provided some information
 aties aatanki haath hone ke angel kii bhi jaanch kar rahi he
 Now the question is whether the nearest station master was not aware of this? Who will take responsibility for the incident? In every accident, the Railway Ministry, which is looking for a terrorist conspiracy, is not able to keep so much information on which track is being worked on
 Surprisingly, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu continues to boast about making the railways state-of-the-art
 3
 Railways find an angle after every accident, after Suresh Prabhu became the Railway Minister, the Railway Ministry has learned a new trick
 or tarkeeb ye he ki har haadase ke baad pallaa jhaadne ke liye nae-nae angel dhundhana
 The terror plot is a completely new formula
 kathith taur par aatankiyon ko jimmedaar bataakar railway apni jimmedaari se batch jaataa he or janata bhi use begunaah maan leti he
 4
 train haadason se nahin lee seekhpichley teen saalon main suresh prabhu ke railmantri rahete hue teen saalon main kam se kam 6 rail haadase hue hai
 Hundreds of people have died in these
 hajaaron log ghayal hue hai
 But the railway did not take any lessons
 railmantri har baar safar ko surakshit banane ke daawey karte hai
 But then three layers of the same dielectric
 koi sudhaar nahin hota or ek nayaa haadasa ho jaataa he
 5
 kiraaya bad rahaa, lekin yatriyon kii suraksha nahinsuresh prabhu ne 2014 main railmantri kaa padbhaar sanbhaalane ke baad rail kiraye main din dooni or raat chauguni badhotaree kii he
 Prabhu had guaranteed that railway accidents would be stopped and rail travel would be made safe
 lekin teen saal baad bhi nateeja sifer rahaa he
 Railway accidents are happening at regular intervals and there is no concrete plan to stop them
 haadase ke baad marane waalon ke parijanon ke liye muaavje kaa elaan ho jaataa he or agle din se sthiti saamaanya ho jaati he
 Will the Railway Minister be able to tell what the Ministry did to prevent the rail accident after the Kanpur rail accident? Who will take responsibility for those who died in the Muzaffarnagar railway accident
 23 se zyada marane waalon or 40 se zyada ghayalon ke liye koun jimmedaar he
 When will Suresh Prabhu understand that railway accidents do not stop with tweets

 Recalling that scene, Vikas had said, 'I did not know who those people were and where i was at that time
 yahi nahin usee parivaar ne apane kisi rishtedaar ko bhejkar shef vikaas ke bhai ke bare main pataa lagaaya ki wo puri tarah surakshit he
 Vikas Khanna's union with that Muslim family is being praised on social media too

 The government is sourcing from Egypt, Turkey and Afghanistan; lekin pyaaj ke badhate aayaat se ab kisaan pareshaan ho rahe hai
 Farmers are feeling that the new onion coming from the fields will be affected due to high imports
 darasal pyaaj ke daam main ijaphe ko dekhte hue kuch kisaan samay se purv pyaaj ko kheton se ukhadkar bazaar main pahunchaa rahe hai
 Farmers say that in late December and first week of January, domestic onions will reach the market in a big way
 aise main videshon se mangaaye ja rahe pyaaj kii vajah se unki fasal ko sahi keemat nahin mil paaegi
 Onion import on a large scale, on Thursday, the government was told in Parliament that 69 of onions this year
 9 lakh ton paidaavaar kaa anumaan tha
 But under changed circumstances 53
 73 lakh ton utpaadan kii sambhaavna he
 Which led to a rise in prices
 sarkaar is 15
 It is taking various measures to overcome the shortage of 88 lakh tonnes of onions
 maaloom ho ki pichley kuch hafton main pyaaj ke daamon main achaanak oochaal dekhne ko mila
 In many big cities of the country, onion prices reached 150 to 200 rupees per kg
 lekin ab pichley ek hafte se keemat main giravat aar rahi he
 Because onions are being sourced from abroad on a large scale
 turki se sabase zyada pyaaj aane kii ummidapyaaj kii keemton par kaabo paane ke liye centre sarkaar misr, turki or afghanistan se pyaaj manga rahi he
 The government has decided to import more than one lakh tonnes of onions
 desh main pyaaj kii uplabdhta badhaane ke liye phir 12,660 ton pyaaj aayaat ke naye saude kiye gaye hai, jisaki aavak 27 disambar se shuru ho jaaegi
 On Thursday, Parliament was told that so far about 30,000 tonnes of onion import deals have been done and MMTC has been directed to issue three tenders for importing 15,000 tonnes of onions
 prayek tender 5,000 ton ke hai
 According to a report, MMTC has signed deals to import 6,090 tonnes of onions from Egypt and 15,000 tonnes from Turkey
 iske alaava 1500 se 2000 ton pyaaj afghanistan se mangaaye ja rahe hai
 The farmers are worried about their onions and the country farmers and onion traders are scared that the onions being sourced from abroad will also come from late December to early January, and at the same time onions from the fields will also reach the market
 aise main videshon se mangaaye ja rahe mahange pyaaj kii vajah se unke pyaaj ke kharidaar nahin milenge
 Because the government will have foreign onions in stock
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki videshon se bade paimaane par mangaaye ja rahe pyaaj unke liye nuksaandeh sabit hoga
 Demand to lift the ban on exports, farmers and traders have warned that if any imports are signed after the end of January, the move will not be right
 kyonki sarkaar ne pyaaj ke niryaat par farvari tak bain laga rakhaa he
 In such a situation, the farmers will not only have to sell their produce at low prices, but they may have to face heavy losses as onion prices will be below normal
 isliye sarkaar ko aayaat main katautee ke saath-saath emport par laga bain ko hataane par bhi vichaar karnaa chahie

 unhone kaha ki yoga shaareerik vyaayaam kaa pramukh saadhan he, naa ki kisi prakaar kii dharmik kriya kaa hissaa
 It is completely wrong to associate it with namaz or any religious practice
 kattarpanthi sanghathan isamen bhram failaakar majahabon ke bich vaimnasy failaane kii sajeesh rach rahe hai
 Dargah Diwan Syed Zainul Abedin Ali Khan said in a statement released on Tuesday that on the initiative of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the entire world including the united nation is preparing to celebrate Yoga Day on June 21, which is a respectable thing for India
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri kaa vah faisla, jisamen surya namaskara ko yogic kriyaaon se nikaalane ke liye liya he, swaagat karne yogya he
 By doing this, the Prime Minister has given more support to the communal harmony of the country by respecting the religious sentiments of all religions

 bijepi ke 'bhishma pitamah' laal krishna adwani ke liye gujarat ab sef nahin mana ja rahaa he
 In fact, it has become expensive for him to contest against Narendra Modi, the party's prime ministerial candidate
 ek angreji akhbaar ke mutabik adwani kaa gujarat se ladanaa ab anishchat dikhaai de rahaa he
 Significantly, Advani won the election from Gandhinagar last time, but this time it is difficult to say whether he will fight again from here
 samajha jaataa he ki vah khud yahaan se chunaav ladane ko icchhuk hai, lekin samasya he ki modi ke samarthak unke khilaaf hai
 In such a situation, Gandhinagar seat is no longer safe
 darasal, adwani or modi donon netaaon main kaaphi samay se patari nahin baith rahi he or uske kai kaaran hai
 The first reason is that a large number of illegal temples were demolished in Gandhinagar in 2008, for which the Advani camp blamed Modi
 uske baad se donon ke sambandhon main khatas aa gai
 The second case is about the current election in which Advani once again wanted to become the bjp's PM candidate
 modi kaa naam aane ke baad unhone is ore apni naaraazgi bhi jaahir kii thi
 It is also believed that Modi's Gujarati supporters are angry
 bataaya jaataa he ki party ke andruni surveykshan se bhi yah baat pataa chali he ki adwani ke vahaan se ladane par haar kaa khatra ho saktaa he
 The party has since been searching for a safe seat for him
 samajha jaataa he ki madhya pradesh kii bhopal seat se unhen tikat diya ja saktaa he
 The party has performed well in Madhya Pradesh and their chances of winning from there are better
 madhya pradesh bijepi ke varisht netaa kailash joshi ne adwani ko bhopal se ladane kaa nimantran bhi diya he
 Joshi is an MP from Bhopal and does not want to contest the election this time, while Advani has a problem and does not want to leave Gandhinagar

 desh ke agle raashtrapati kaa chunaav ho chukaa he
 It has been more than four months since the BJP government was formed in UP
 niyam ke mutabik ab agle do maheene ke andar yogi adityanath or keshav prasad maurya ko saansad pad se istipha dekar vidhansabha kii sadsyta leni hogi
 The talk has been going on since the time when Yogi was made the Chief Minister and Keshav Prasad Maurya as Deputy Chief Minister after BJP won the assembly elections
 haalanki baad main spasht hua ki ye log raashtrapati chunaav ke baad istipha denge
 It is now discussed in the political circles that the BJP may give Keshav Prasad Maurya a big responsibility not in UP but at the Center
 bijepi ke is apratyaashit faisle ke peeche bhi ek raajnneetik charchaa maatr he ki rajyasabha se istipha dene ke baad mayawati keshav prasad maurya dwaara chodi jane vaali phulpur loksabhaa seat se chunaav lard sakati hai
 Let us tell you that BSP has not confirmed this yet, although it has definitely revealed Mayawati's strategy to strengthen BSP at the ground level after the crushing defeat in the recent elections
 jisamen bataaya gaya he ki rajyasabha se istipha dene vaali 18 taarikh ko har maheene do mandalon main ek raily karengi
 Mayawati has planned to tour UP from 18 September 2017 to 18 June 2018 to revive the party
 bijepi kaa agrim bachaav!soshal media par viral mayawati kaa 'phulpur plan' agar sach he to keshav maurya ko kendra main le janaa bijepi ke agrim bachaav ke taur par mana janaa chahie
 The BJP will never want to lose a high profile seat like Phulpur and it can only postpone the by-election
 vah 2019 ke chunaavon ke aasapaas aisi kisi haar ke liye taiyaar nahin hogi
 UP BJP leaders are currently trying to avoid speaking anything on this issue
 unke mutabik party kaa jo bhi faisla hoga bataa diya jayega
 Loss or gain to Keshav Prasad If the BJP decides to keep Keshav Prasad as MP, then Keshav Prasad Maurya will have to leave the post of Deputy Chief Minister of a big state like Uttar Pradesh
 lekin ummid he ki bijepi is evaj main unhen modi cabinet main koi ahm jimmedaari bhi de saktaa he
 Mayawati's loss due to plan leak If it happens, then obviously Mayawati will suffer
 phulpur seat khaali ho sakati thi, us par mayawati chunaav lard sakati thim, sambhavat: jeet bhi sakati thim
 But, with their alleged 'phulpur plan' leaking, it is believed that now this seat is hardly vacant
 or yogi adityanath kii gorakhpur loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladanaa mayawati ke liye utana aasaan bhi nahin hoga

 bansal ne kaha ki kuch pratirohak prabhaav banane ke liye upyukt sajaa kii aavashyaktaa he
 Not only this, the court refused to have any leniency with the convict
 faisla sunaate hue adaalat ne kaha ki yah aam dharna ban gai he ki shikayatakartaaon, gavaahon or aparaadh ke peediton ke saath police uchit vyavhaar nahin karti he
 At the same time, the court made a stern comment, saying that this case is a perfect example of how the victim family has dialed 100 numbers and invited difficulties for themselves
 vyavastha dete hue adaalat ne kaha ‘police adhikari hone ke naate samaaj kii raksha karnaa aaropee kaa daayitv tha, na ki use samaaj ke khilaaf aparaadh karnaa chahie tha
 According to the complaint, on 30 May 2013, there was some altercation between Vishal and his wife and the woman threatened to commit suicide
 vishaal ne police ko suchit kiya
 Then Singh went there and brought the whole family to the police station
 aage shikaayat main kaha gaya he ki parivaar kaa maamla to sulajh gaya, lekin eesai singh ne vishaal or uske pita se 50,000 rupee maangate hue unhen dhamkaaya ki vah unhen aatmahatya ke liye uksaane ke maamle main fansaa degaa or jail bhej degaa
 The victim paid Rs 20,000 on 31 May 2013, but Vishal's friend made a video of Singh taking a bribe
 phir is sambandh main praathmiki hui
 The court while giving the system said that corruption is making the backbone of the country hollow and it directly affects the economy

 The Cabinet recommendation has been forwarded to President Ramnath Kovind
 isse pehle maharashtra ke governor bhagat singh koshyari ne centre or kanoonvidon se halaat par kanoonee salaah lee
 Following this advice, the Governor recommended the Home Ministry to impose President's Rule
 is sifarish ke virodh main shivasena supreme court pahunch gai he
 There will be a hearing in this matter tomorrow
 kyon hui raashtrapati shashan kii sifarishasutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki ensipi ne aaj subah 11:30 baje rajyapal ko ek khat likhaa tha, jisamen do din kaa samay maanga tha
 The Governor recommended ncp's letter to the Home Ministry to impose President's rule in Maharashtra
 isse pehle jab shivasena ne bhi rajyapal se sarkaar banane ke liye do din kaa or vakt maanga tha, to use bhi asweekaar kar diya gaya tha
 On this basis, the Governor rejected the demand of NCP and recommended tax to the Central Government for imposition of President's rule in Maharashtra

 bharat e ke coach rahul dravid ne australia e ke haathon 119 ran kii haar ko niraashajanak qaraar dete hue kaha ki unke ballebaajon ko spin ke khilaaf apni kamajoriyon kaa hal dhundhna hoga or trikoniya vanade siries ke agle match main majboot vaapasi kerani hogi
 Disappointing performance In their first match of the triangular series, India were chased down for only 215 runs chasing a target of 334 runs, after which Dravid said, 'I think it was a disappointing performance from all sides, first off the ball, Also in fielding and in batting
 acchhee cheez yah he ki hamaare paas sambhavat: chaar match hai or ham isamen sudhaar karne kii koshish karenge
 Dravid said the strategy was not implemented properly on the field but his players were motivated and would try to exploit the opportunity to impress the selectors by performing better in the next match
 prayek match ko lekar betaab hai khiladiunhone kaha, 'ye sabhi khilaadi yuva hai or sabhi chayankartaaon ko prabhavit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai or apni chhap chhodana chaahate hai
 i think they are desperate for every match
 ' aapako bataa den ki bharat e ke khiladiyon ne test siries or is match main spin gendbaajon kaa acchhee tarah saamana nahin kiya
 On this matter, Dravid said that his players can play spinners much better but today they failed to implement the strategy
 spin khilne par dena hoga zyada dhyanaunhone kaha, 'yah aisa kshetra he jis par hamen nishchit taur par vichaar karnaa hoga
 You will remember how Moin Ali and other bowlers bowled in the Test match
 yahaan ham bade lakshya kaa peechha kar rahe the
 Leg spinner Adam Jampa always risks for the wicket
 jab aap 334 ran ke lakshya kaa peechha kar rahe ho to aapako kaaphi jokhim uthaane hote hai
 i think we can definitely play spinners far better
 eemaandaaree se kahuun to unhone test maichon main hamaari tulana main spin ko behatar khelaa or vanade main bhi
 We have talked about this
 hamane is par abhyaas bhi kiya
 It is a question of wearing it only in the match
 input :bhashaa Amid rhetoric about the head of the new government in Karnataka, JDS supremo and former Prime Minister Deve Gowda said that we had offered the Chief Minister's post to the Congress, but they did not accept it
 ajtak ke sawaal par devgauda ne kaha, 'mujhase congress ne hi sampark kiya or maine apni sahmati de di
 The Congress said that Kumaraswamy should take charge of the post of Chief Minister in this difficult situation
 ' unhone kaha, 'main satta kaa bhookha nahin hum
 Read the key points of his interview - 1- Media is responsible for our defeat
 media abhi se hi aisa dikhaa rahaa he ki saal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main piem modi ko koi chunauti nahin de saktaa he
 Why is it being thought so? There have been many great leaders in this country? On the question of running the government in Karnataka, he said that there is no talk with Congress for seat sharing or rotation of CM post
 2- meri umr kaaphi ho gai he
 i do not want to contest the 2019 election
 vaise yah meri tabiyat par nirbhar karegaa
 Yes, it is clear that i am not going to retire from politics
 raajnneeti main meri umr seemaa koi tay nahin karegaa
 3- We have formed an alliance
 varisht hone ke naate main congress or jedies ke gathbandhan ko bachaae rakhana chahta hum
 The leader with me has done this before
 yah koi bada masalaa nahin he
 i will try to keep this alliance for five years
 4- meraa koi personal agenda nahin he
 i don't want to do anything that makes me feel like i want to be PM
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki yah astitv ko bachaae rakhane kaa sawaal nahin hai, balki desh se sampradayik takaton ko dur rakhane kaa sawaal he
 5- What is happening in Kashmir, what is happening in the judiciary, the way the legislature is running and the way the executive is breaking, it is a threat to the constitution
 main piem rahane ke dauraan 10 maheene main paanch baar kashmir gaya, lekin aaj halaat badtar ho gaye hai
 6- We cannot put the entire charge of today's situation on a political party
 yah congress or kshetreey partiyon samet kai raajnneetik dalon kii vifaltaa kaa nateeja he
 We are all responsible for this
 main yah nahin kahana chahta hum ki phala-phala party iske liye jimmedaar he
 One has to forget past mistakes and move forward
 7- congress ke paas nau saansad hai or hamaare paas do
 Seat allocation is not an issue for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 ekajute hokar ham netritv karenge
 The Congress and the regional party also have many stalwarts
 manmohan singh ne 10 saal tak sarkaar chalaai thi
 However, only a few things are being thrown up in the media
 8- main 13 dalon ke gathbandhan kii sarkaar ke dauraan kiye gaye kaamon ko ginanaa nahin chahta hum
 We also made mistakes, but did not accuse anyone else
 aaj ke halaat bahut kharaab hai
 Attacks are being carried out in the name of cow protection
 9- taminladu kii raajnneeti main padaarpan karne vaale film abhinaytaon camel hasan or rajnikant ko kumaraswami ke siem pad ke shapath samaaroh main bulaane par devgauda ne kaha ki abhi in donon se baat nahin hui he or unhen bulaane main koi harj bhi nahin he
 10- The decision of the court in Cauvery dispute will be acceptable
 supreme court ke aadesh kaa koi ulanghan nahin kar saktaa
 Disputes will be settled
 ham dekhenge ki is maamle main ham phir se court main janaa thik he yaa padosi rajya se baat karnaa
 11- All left leaders including Karunanidhi's sons Stalin, Baloo, Sharad Pawar, Farooq Abdullah, Mamta Banerjee have been invited to the swearing-in ceremony of Kumaraswamy
 sabhi saath chalane ko taiyaar hai
 This may be the beginning, but i cannot say tomorrow
 kya he karnataka vidhansabha kii tasvirdrasal, yediurppa kii sarkaar girane ke baad ab jedies ke kumaraswami mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, the question is arising that only 37 JDS mlas have won the Karnataka Assembly elections and Kumaraswamy is going to become the Chief Minister, while the Congress has won 78 mlas and is not getting the Chief Minister's post
 maaloom ho ki is chunaav main 104 siten jitkar bijepi sabase badi party banakar ubhari, lekin bahumat ke liye jaruri 112 siton ke jaadui aankade tak nahin pahunch pai
 At the same time, Congress won 78 seats and JDS 37 seats
 is tarah karnataka chunaav main kisi bhi party ko bahumat nahin mila, to congress ne bijepi ko satta main aane se rokane ke liye jedies ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kar diya
 There was an uphill event, Governor Vajubhai Vala invited the BJP which won the most seats in the elections to form the government and Yeddyurappa took the oath of Chief Minister
 iske baad congress or jedies kii yachika par supreme court ne yediurppa ko shanivaar shaam chaar baje tak bahumat sabit karne ko kaha, lekin wo iske liye jaruri vidhayak nahin juta paae or siem pad se istipha de diya
 After this, now Kumaraswamy is going to form the government with the support of Congress
 congress ke paas 78 vidhayak hai, jabaki jedies ke paas sirf 37 vidhayak hai
 Usually, the party whose coalition has more number of mlas, the Chief Minister's post also comes in its own bag
 aise main congress par sawaal uthanaa laazmi he
 Kumaraswamy, who met Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, reached Delhi before taking oath of JDS kkumaraswamyusbe's Chief Minister and met Congress President Rahul Gandhi and UPA President Sonia Gandhi
 unhone donon ko apane shapath grahan samaaroh main aane ke liye aamantrit bhi kiya
 During this, Danish Ali of JDS and KC Venugopal of Congress were also present at Rahul Gandhi's residence
 somvaar ko kumaraswami ne basapa supremeo mayawati se bhi mulaakaat kii
 After meeting Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, Kumaraswamy said, "I wanted to show my respect to the Gandhi family
" lihaaja main rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi se milane yahaan aayaa hum
 i requested both of them to attend the swearing-in ceremony
 is par donon shapath grahan samaaroh main shaamil hone ke liye raji ho gaye
 Rahul will attend Kumaraswamy's swearing-in ceremony, after which Rahul Gandhi said that HD Kumaraswamy will attend the oath-taking ceremony
 unhone twit kiya, 'meri echdi kumaraswami se dilli main somvaar shaam ko sauhardpurn mulaakaat hui
 We discussed the political situation in Karnataka and other issues of mutual interest
 main buudhvaar ko bengalooru main unke shapath grahan samaaroh main hissaa luungaa
 He has also been invited for the swearing-in ceremony of Kumaraswamy, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and other leaders for the swearing-in ceremony
 or bhi hai dar kii vajah!cabinet main jagah milane se naaraazgi saamne ke alaava kuch or kaaran bhi congress or jedies ke sheersh netritv kii chintaa kaa sabab bane hai

 lakshmi orang naamak is adivasee mahila ne ipisi or soochna praudyogiki adhinium kii vibhinn dhaaraon ke tahat sab divijinal nyaayik magistrate kii adaalat main shikaayat daayar kii he
 He had demanded registration of a case against Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, alleging that the case was filed

 The woman filed a case against MP Ram Prasad Sarma for sharing the photo
 bataate chalem ki isse pehle bhi yogi adityanath ke khilaaf kai cese darj hue hai
 He was booked under Section 153A of the IPC for causing harmony between various groups on the basis of religion, caste, place of birth, residence, language etc
 ipisi kii dhara 295 ke tahat bhi do maamle darj hai

 ' The SP, which had won a big win with the support of the BSP in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections, is strong, and disappointing in the BJP camp
 23 saal puraani dushmani ko bhulaakar saath aae sapa-basapa kii ab najar kairana loksabhaa seat par he, jo bijepi saansad hukum singh ke nidhan ke chalate rikt hui he
 Explain that after victory in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had reached home to congratulate BSP supremo Mayawati
 donon pramukh netaaon ke saath kareeb 40 minute tak baatcheet hui
 This is the first victory for SP since the 2017 assembly elections
 aise main sapa ko basapa ke saath milakar bijepi ko haraane kaa formula mil gaya he
 Formula of equal seat in SP-BSP Even though the SP and BSP have not formally aligned for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the two have made up their mind to enter the election summer together in the future
 sutron kii maane to sapa or basapa baraabar seat ke saath loksabhaa chunaav main utarane ke liye sahamat hai
 In such a situation, 40 out of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats of the state will come into account
 donon kaa saath aate hai aisa hoga nateejaagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main donon ek saath utarate hai, to aise main 2017 vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ke hisaab se 57 siten sapa or basapa ke khate main jaaegi
 At the same time, BJP will get only 23 seats
 haalanki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne 71 siten upi se jiti thi, jo ab ghatakar 68 ho gai hai
 The Kairan Lok Sabha seat is to be held by-election
 kairan main basapa ko sapa kar sakati he samarthansapa-basapa ke saath aane kaa aglaa test kairan loksabhaa seat he
 In February this year, the BJP fell vacant after the death of MP Hukam Singh
 phulpur-gorakhpur main sapa ke paas aane ke baad ab kairana main mana ja rahaa he ki basapa apana ummidavaar utaar sakati he
 In such a situation, the BSP can support the SP
 jis prakaar phulpur or gorakhpur main basapa ne sapa ummidavaar ko samarthan kiya tha
 The bsp's burgeoning Kadam BSP is in no hurry this time
 wo phoonk-foonkkar gathbandhan ke liye kadam badha rahi he
 That is why UP has tested by giving support in the by-elections in both the seats
 sapa kii ore se sakaaratmak kadam dikh rahe hai
 The way Akhilesh Yadav has credited the victory to the BSP
 isse mayawati kaa dil pasija he or unhone puraane jakhmon par maraham lagaakar bhavishya main aage saath chalane kaa rasta saaf kar diya he
 In 1993, the akhilesh-mayawati duo did the first test
 In 1993, mulayam-kanshi Ram did not allow the BJP to come to power by stopping the Ram Mandir wave by forming an alliance
 usee tarah modi lahar ko rokane main akhilesh or mayawati safal hue hai
 Explain that both the parties have enough marks in mathematics to stop the BJP in the state
 donon dalon ke paas majboot vot bank he, jiske boote par bijepi ko 2014 jaisaa itihaas dohraane se roak sakate hai

 mahant dharmadas ke saath hi triloki pandeya ne bhi kiya daawavihip ke pravaktaa bole- ramanand sampradaay kaa ho pujaryodhya ke varshon puraane mandir masjid vivaad kaa nirnay to supreme court ne de diya, lekin ab ek nai jang shuru ho gai he
 The court has also ordered the central government to form a trust in 3 months for the construction of Ram temple
 ab trust banane se pehle hi varchasv ke saath nirmit mandir main puja paath or bhoga raag ke adhikaar ko lekar ladaai shuru ho gai he
 Everyone wants to be a priest
 isko lekar ab pradhanmantri ko bhi patr likhe jane lage hai
 Along with Guru brothers Acharya Satyendra Das and Mahant Dharam Das, the party of Ramlala Virajman and member of Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, Triloki Nath Pandey have also joined the race to become priests
 pujari banane kii yah hode ram mandir ke pakshakaar mahant dharm das kii ore se pradhanmantri, mukhyamantri or ram mandir ke resiver ko patr likhe jane se shuru hui
 In this letter, he also referred to his Guru Baba Abhiram Das being a priest of the Ram temple in 1949, while a lawsuit was lodged against him as a priest, and on the basis of this, the temple and mosque parties made him a party as a priest
 mahant ne yah bhi kaha he ki supreme court ne apane aadesh main unke guru baba abhiram das ko hi tatkaaleen pujari mana he
 On this basis, they have demanded to make themselves trustees and priests in the trusts formed by citing tradition and law
 vartmaan pujari satyendra das ne bhi kiya daawaaraam mandir ke vartmaan pujari or mahant dharm das ke bade guru bhai acharya satyendra das ne bhi 27 saal se ram lalaa kii puja karte aane kaa ullekh karte hue pujari banane kaa daawa kar diya
 Das has cited carrying forward the tradition of his Guru Baba Abhiram Das and said that it was on this basis that the receiver of the Ram temple selected him for the priest as the greatest disciple
 mahant dharm das ke pujari ke liye daawa karne ke sambandh main unhone kaha ki ho saktaa he unke guru bhai usee parampara ko aage badhaane kii baat kar rahe ho lekin unako yah maang kerani chahie ki jab bade guru bhai pujari hai to chote guru bhai kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Acharya also justified Dharam Das's demand and said that he is our younger brother
 puja kaa adhikaarchaahe hamako mili yaa unako mili, unhen iskaa samarthan karnaa chahie
 The party of Ramlala Virajaman also did the competition in the ongoing competition to become a priest among the Dawoodo Guru brothers, the party of Ramalala Virajaman, Triloki Nath Pandey also killed the entry
 pandeya ne vartmaan pujari satyendra das ko kamishnar kaa karmchaaree qaraar dete hue kaha ki unhen vetan miltaa he
 The priest will build trust
 unhone mahant dharm das ko lekar kaha ki vah hai court tak chale mukademe tak mere achche mitra hua karte the
 The party of Ramlala Virajman said that now he is under the influence of some people
 nahin jaanata ki unhen koun guide kar rahaa he
 Pandey said that when it was acquired after the structure collapsed, the government made Satyendra Das a priest instead of Lal Das
 unhone kaha ki clem karnaa to bahut acchhee baat he, isamen kya aapatti ho sakati he
 Pandey, expressing his desire to become a priest, said that what is lacking in me that one cannot become a priest
 daawa to meraa bhi he
 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) spokesperson Sharad Sharma, who was a frontrunner in the Shishra Ram temple movement on Dharma Das and Satyendra Das, attacked the present priest Satyendra Das and Dharmadas and said that the priest is all virtuous, Vedic ritualist , Must be a person of the celibate Ramananda sect who follows Brahmacharya
 thik usee tarj par jaisaa ki mata vaishno devi or tirupati balaji main hota he
 Worship should be done with the same method
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki pujari koun hoga, yah trust tay karegaa
 The Supreme Court has ordered the Nirmohi Akhara to participate in the trust to be constituted as a partner in the management of the Ram temple and the Akhada has sought a time to meet the Prime Minister by meeting the Panchs to ascertain their obligations
 It will be interesting to see how far the race to become the priest of the Ram temple goes
 mritak ladki ke pita kaa kahana he ki wo log koun hote hai maarane vaale? uskaa baba abhi zindaa tha agar namaaz nahin padhati to mere paas bhej dete or bolte kii apni beti ko namaaz padhanaa siikhaa lo, lekin wo log aise kism ke log he ki unke paas janaa matlab maar kha ke waapas aana

 The streets of San Francisco will now be illuminated by trees, not streetlights
 padhakar atapata sa lag rahaa he lekin ab raat main roshni ke liye streetliton kaa nahin balki pedo kaa istemaal kiya jayega
 This will not only save the natural resources being spent in electricity generation, but will also promote tree plantation in cities
 america ke california ke san francisco ke vaigyanik or udyogpati omari amirao drori kii maane to jin sanshodhan ke jariye aise chote vrikshon kaa vikaas kiya ja saktaa he, jinase jugnu kii tarah roshni failaane vaale protein kaa risaav hota rahe
 Drory is envisioning a future when such plants will replace roadlamps
 vigyaan samaacharon kii website www
 sciencenews
 org ne drori ke hawaale se kaha, 'mere vichaar se yah bahut mjedaar hoga
 This earth can become a more beautiful world consisting of plants that spread light
 ' mjedaar tathy yah he ki america main 8433 log unke samarthan main aage bhi aae hai
 These people have collected $ 484,013 for a campaign that ended on June 7 on Kickstarter, the website of the crowdfunding institution via the Internet for a noble initiative by a person or organization
 drori ke samarthakon ne is shodh ke liye aavashyak raashi se kahin adhik raashi ikatthi kar lee he, jisaki sahaayta se drori ab apane agle abhiyaan ke tahat prakaash failaane vaala gulab viksit karne ke liye shodh kar sakenge
 Plants that grow by modifying this gene will emit very little light, but Drory believes that that light will be enough to illuminate the streets at night

 ) haal hi main rialami dwaara 64MP camere vaale smartphone kaa tiger jari kiya gaya he
 Redmi and Realme had already given information about bringing a smartphone with 64MP camera
 ab jaankaree mili he ki samsung aisa hi ek smartphone laane kii taiyaari main he, jise Galaxy a siries ke tahat utaara jayega
 It is to be noted that a smartphone with 64MP camera can be launched by Samsung even earlier than expected
 aisi charchaa he ki samsung dwaara gallexi a siries ke tahat nayaa smartphone sitambar ke maheene main launch kiya ja saktaa he, jisamen 64MP camera hoga
 However, if a smartphone with 64MP camera is launched soon by Samsung, then it will not be surprising
 kyonki samsung ke paas company kaa khud develop kiya hua solution ISOCELL Bright GW1 ke form main he
 This is the company's own 64 megapixel camera sensor, which was introduced in the month of May
 philhal ye saaf nahin he ki koun se samsung smartphone main is sensor ko sabase pehle diya jayega
 But Tipster Ice Universe claims that this sensor will be given by Samsung in the new Galaxy a series phones in the month of September or October
 tipster ne apane twit main ye likhaa he ki redmy bhi 64MP camere vaala smartphone isi maheene launch karegaa
 At the same time, Samsung has also resumed plans to launch 64MP a series phones
 aise main samajha ja saktaa he ki samsung ne shuruyaat main 64MP camere vaale smartphone ko launch karne kaa plan drop kar diya hoga
 But as soon as the company saw that rival companies like Redmi and Realme were creating a lot of atmosphere about it, then the company would have started working on this project again
 haalanki abhi ye saaf nahin he ki koun si company sabase pehle 64MP camere vaala smartphone launch karegi

 Elections are due in Pakistan on 25 July

 But in the midst of this electoral movement there is also an invisible force which can have a big impact on the election results of Pakistan
 ham baat kar rahe hai pakistan ke 'deep state' kii
 Actually 'deep state' is the concept of any state in which the army, intelligence department and bureaucracy influence the policies of the state from behind the scenes

 chunaavon ke thik pehle media kii aazaadee par bhi lagaam laga di gai he
 Read this: Will Pakistan, Sharif win or Imran in electoral mode? Haqqani says that the Pakistan Army wants a government in Islamabad that does not follow the dictates of the army and not a government that enjoys public confidence
 halaki pakistani sena ke is tarah ke prayog ab tak vyarth hi gaye hai
 Highlighting Pakistan's political history, Haqqani says that when Pakistan's first general elections in 1970, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of the Awami League of East Pakistan, won a record majority, it was due to the intervention of the Pakistan Army that Bangladesh became Pakistan and Pakistan Broken into two
 iske baad 90 ke dashak main sena kii puri takat pakistan kii purv pradhanmantri benazir bhutto kii adhyakshata vaali pakistan pipuls party (pipipi) kii badhati lokapriyata ko kamatar karne main lagi rahi
 For which the army raised Nawaz Sharif against Bhutto
 hkkani kehete hai ki ab teen dashak baad jab sena pipipi ke prabhaav ko lagbhag khatm kar chuki he to usne khud ke dwaara khadaa kiye hue nawaz sharif kii piemail-en ko khatm karne me apni puri takat jhok di he
 Haqqani says whatever the outcome of the elections on July 25, but naturally it will bring instability in Pakistan
 agar deep state ke pitthu pakistan taharik-e-insaaf or uske sahyogi jeet bhi jate hai to unki koi vishwasniyata nahi hogi
 So anyone who won this election but the people of Pakistan and democracy would be defeated

 'tenaliram (tenali Rama) ke pankaj beri (pankaj Berry)ne batayah 'us din kaaphi thand thi or ghor andhera tha or mujhe kuch samay tak koi bhi nahin dikhaa
 While i was walking, i suddenly felt someone following me
 main use dekhne ke liye peeche muda lekin vahaan koi nahin dikhaai diya
 This happened again but there was no one there again
 baad main, maine paaya ki ek shadow mere saath chal rahi he or main dar gaya
 i ran as fast as i could and i kept reading Hanuman Chalisa and i did not look back
 main puure raste bhaagta rahaa or apane ghar ke saamne hi jaakar hi rukaa or main bahut jor-jor se haaf rahaa tha
 i never got to know what that shadow was but i can't forget that night
 ' It is known by the name Sriyantra that it is the instrument of Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth
 kehete hai ki jahaan shriyantra kii sthapana hoti he vahaan maa lakshmi aane ke liye vivash ho jaati hai
 According to a legend, once Lakshmi Ma became angry and went to Baikuntha
 unke bina dharti par traahi-traahi much gai
 Then Devguru Brihaspati suggested the solution of 'shreeyantra' installation and worship to attract Lakshmiji
 phir maa lakshmi ko dharti par aane ke liye vivash hona padaa
 What are Yantras? - Yantra is a special type of fixed geometric shape which is the physical form of the hymns
 - kisi vishesh mantra yaa shakti ko agar rup main dhaala jaae to yantra kaa nirmaan hota he
 - Special use of shapes, lines and points in the device
 - ek bhi rekha, akruti yaa bindu ke galat hone se arth kaa anarth ho saktaa he
 - There are two types of instruments - the first with lines and figures and the second numbered instruments
 - ankon vaale yantra kii tulana main akruti vaale yantra zyada taqatvar hote hai
 What is the glory of Shriyantra? The whole world knows that for the wealth and prosperity of Goddess Lakshmi is very important, but how the blessings of Mother Lakshmi are available, very few people have understood
 aaj ham aapako maa lakshmi kii krupa paane kaa sabase achook or divya upaay bataane ja rahe hai
 - Lord Shankaracharya had proved Shriyantra
 - duniya main sabase zyada prasiddh or taqatvar yantra shriyantra hi he
 - Although consider Sriyantra as a symbol of wealth, but it is also a symbol of power and uncommon accomplishment
 - shriyantra ke prayog se sampannataa, samruddhi or ekaagratha kii prapti hoti he
 Every kind of impoverishment can be overcome with the right use of Sriyantra
 - shriyantra kai tarah kaa hota he- samtal, ubhara hua or pyramid kii tarah kaa bhi
 - Every type of Shriantra is beneficial in a different way
 shriyantra ke prayog kii saavdhaaniyaan kya hai?maa lakshmi kaa priy shriyantra insaan kodhan, sampada, sampannataa or vaibhavse maalamaal kar saktaa he lekin koi bhi yantra yaa mantra tabhi apana puraa prabhaav dikhaa paata he jab ham use sahi niyam or saavdhaanee se prayog karte hai
 - There are two types of shape of Sriyantra - Upward facing and downward
 - urdhvamukhi kaa arth he upar kii ore or adhomukhi kaa arth he neeche kii ore
 - Lord Shankaracharya has given the highest recognition to the symbol of the upward wave
 - shriyantra kii sthapana karne ke pehle dekh len ki yantra bilkul thik bana ho
 - Because by installing the wrong device you can get surrounded by many kinds of difficulties
 - shriyantra kaa chitra aap kaam karne ke sthaan par, padhane ke sthaan par or puja ke sthaan par laga sakate hai
 - Wherever the establishment of Shriyantra, keep the sattvikta and chant regular mantras
 ekaagratha ke liye kaise karen shriyantra kaa prayog?maa lakshmi kaa yantra hone ke kaaran zyaadaatar log yahi samajhate hai ki shriyantra se keval dhan kii kaamana puri ho sakati he lekin aaj ham aapako maansik shanti or ekaagratha ke liye shriyantra kaa uttam prayog samajhaayenge
 
 
 - Put a picture of the upward facing device on your work or place of reading
 - shriyantra kaa chitra rangeen ho to zyada acha hoga
 - Put Sriyantra in such a way that it is right in front of your eyes
 - jahaan bhi shriyantra ko sthapit karen, vahaan gandagi na failaaen, nasha naa karen
 How to use Shriyantra for money? According to astrologers, Shriyantra is used differently for different desires
 agar aapako jeevanabhar ke liye dhan or sampannataa chahie to aise karen is yantra kaa prayog
 
 
 - Install Sri Yantra with pyramid of crystal in place of worship
 - ise gulabi kapade yaa choti si chaowkee par sthapit karen
 - Every morning, bathe this machine with water and offer flowers
 - phir ghi kaa deepak jalaakar shri yantra ke mantra kaa jaap karen
 - The mantra will be - Sri Sri Cleansing Hundred: He is Shri Shree Arya xxwrep 26 Shree Sree s 23 may 2019 aa hi gaya
 The debate over EVM in the last five years does not seem to have reached any destination
 court se lekar chunaav ayog ke aashwaasan ke baad bhi counting ke samay i ve em ko lekar andeh bana hua he
 This suspicion has reached the point that workers are starting to gather outside the strong room
 agar unke jamaa hone kaa kaaran yah he ki i ve em mashin badali ja sakati he yaa gadabadi ho sakati he to yah durbhagyapurna he
 This is not good for the credibility of the Election Commission
 jis tarah is chunaav main uske faislon par nazar rakhi gai he, har faisle ko lekar andeh kiya gaya he yah pehle ke chunaavon se kahin zyaada he
 We should also be ashamed about this visualization from Meerut that the level of skepticism about the Commission has reached the point that the activist is monitoring the Stroga form by putting CCTV
 doorabeen se sapa basapa ke kaaryakarta nigaraanee kar rahe hai
 This picture should be viewed in two ways
 kya kaaryakarta shaq ke utsaah main ek sanstha kii chhavi se khilwaad to nahin kar rahe hai yaa kahin aisa to nahin ki chunaav ayog ne is chunaav main apni vishwasaneeyata lagaataar ganvaa di he
 Polling has been held for four and five seats in a single phase in a state
 jabaki halaat aise nahin the
 Since then, a quarter had started to arise about the commission
 pradhanmantri ke khilaaf aachaar samhita kii shikayaton main karrwai main ayog ne kaaphi lanbaa vakt laga diya
 From there, activists began to be alert when EVM machines were caught or seen in strange strange vehicles
 gaadi roak kar pramaan maangane lage
 Sometimes from the hotel or sometimes in an open car or truck, these videos of evms became the cause of commotion all over the country
 upi ke dumriyaganj main sapa basapa kaaryakartaaon ne i ve em se bharaa ek mini trek pakadaa
 It was alleged that this truck was being brought out of the EVM Strong Room
 jabaki yahaan 12 may ko hi vot daale gaye the
 When there was a ruckus, the administration sent it back to the counting center
 jhaansi main city magistrate or ek nijee gaadi main EVM-VVPAT milane par netaaon ne hangaamaa kiya
 Later, the DM reached the spot and examined the EVM in the presence of the leaders
 pataa chalaa ki ye bina istemaal hue reserve EVM the jo chunaav baad dur-daraaj ke ilaaqon se laae ja rahe the
 There are a lot of questions
 in sawaalon ko khaarij karne kii jagah jawaab dhundha janaa chahie ki kyon aisa ho rahaa he
 Do we know the rules? do tarah kii iviem mashine hoti hai
 evms used in voting are kept in strong rooms
 kuch mashine atirikt hoti hai
 If the machine is damaged at any polling station, then the machine is sent from this quota
 matdaan samaapt hone par iviem mashiinon ko sidhe strang room main bhejaata he
 EVM machines are divided into four categories
 jo mashine matdaan centre main rakhi jaati hai, jin par aap matdaan karte hai unhen category e kehete hai
 The machines which were kept in the polling center but found to be wrong are called category B
 teesri mashin hoti he jase catagori si kehete hai jiskaa istamaal nahin hota he
 But there are disturbances
 chauthi prakaar kii mashin hoti he jaska istamaal nahin hota magar reserve main hoti he ise catagori di kehete hai
 As per rules, there should be a separate store room for c &
 bagair sashastr bal ke kisi bhi prakaar kii i ve em mashin kaa movement nahin ho saktaa he
 Under no circumstances can evms be taken to private places or hotels
 strang room main jab mashin pahunchati he to uski soochna ummidavaar ko di jaati he
 Every activity of the machine is videographed
 6 disambar 2018 kii niyamavali he jo aap bhi pard sakate hai
 Please understand once again
 kya in mashiinon kaa parivahan sashastr bal kii nigaraanee main kiya ja rahaa tha
 Armed forces did not appear in some visuals
 isi se mashin kii adla-badali ko lekar ashanka hui
 These machines can be transported in the same vehicle or different types will be used for each vehicle
 chunaav ayog kahata he ki matdaan main istamaal mashiinon ke liye sashastr bal honge lekin jo reserve mashine hai unke parivahan or suraksha kii guideline kya kahati he
 Because of this there is restlessness that there will be no exchange of reserve machines
 kya yah sahi he
 The Election Commission has also started answering all the questions
 aap chunaav ayog ke twitor hander par jaaiye to aapaki ashankaon kaa jawaab milegaa
 The press release has been issued
 mashin ummidavaar or paryvekshak kii maujuudagi main rakhi jaati he
 Everything happens in front of the video camera
 phir strang room ke baahar har paksh ke ummidavaar or kaaryakarta hote hai
 When the counting of votes begins, the candidate's agent is shown all
 kahaan se mashin ai he, uskaa siriyal number kya he
 Counts only when the agent is satisfied
 chunaav shuru hone ke baad raajnneetid dalon ke pratinidhiyon ke saath 93 baithken hoti hai un sabamein yah sab bataaya jaataa he
 The Election Commission has set up a control room for complaints related to evms
 ab aate hai ve ve pi pat kii ginati ko lekar 22 dalon ke pratinidhiyon ne chunaav ayog se maang kii thi ki 5 i ve em or ve ve pat ke milan kii jo anivaary ginati he wo pehle ho phir maton kii ginati shuru ho
 The Election Commission has rejected this demand
 ayog ne kaha he ki 5 i ve em or ve ve pat mashiinon ke random sample kaa milan matganana ho jane ke baad hoga
 This has been considered in the full commission meeting of the Election Commission and the opposition's demand was turned down
 supreme court ne sabhi i ve em mashiinon or ve ve pat kii parachi se milan kii apil ko thukraa diya tha
 Had also reprimanded
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha he ki i ve em par sawaal uthaanaa janadesh kaa apmaan karnaa he

 There is no place in the ward, so the hospital administration made the hospital corridor a ward

 bhartiya cricket ke lihaaj se aisa din jisane bhartiya khelon kii disha hi badal di
 On 25 June 1983, on this day, Kapil Dev's Ranwankurs beat the extremely powerful West Indies team by 43 runs to become the World Cup champions
 baad main varsh 2011 main mahendra singh dhoni ne srilanka ko final main haraakar is uplabdhi ko doharaaya tha
 Talking about 25 June 1983, this victory proved to be changing the condition and direction of Indian sports especially cricket
 is karishmai jeet ke saath hi bhartiya cricket ne duniya ko pehali baar apni takat kaa ahsaas karaayaa tha
 It was only after this victory that a lot of money was rained on Indian cricketers and cricket got the status of professional game in the country
 aaj ke samay sharter formet main tii20 match main bhi 200 yahaan tak ki 250 ran ke aasapaas kaa score bananaa aambaat he lekin 80 ke dashak main vanade cricket main 200 se adhik kaa score bananaa hi badi baat hoti thi
 Cricket fans of today may be surprised to know that in the then 60–60 over ODI match, the Indian team had scored just 183 runs and won by a significant margin of 43 runs
 yah final match mahaan harfanmaulaa kapildev dwaara westeindies ke mahaan ballebaaj viv richards ke yaadgaar kaich ke liye bhi lambey arase tak yaad rahegaa
 The first three World Cups held in England were 60–60 overs
 pehle do worldcup main champion bani westeindies team 1983 main ek baar phir final main thi or unka muqabla behad kamjor maani ja rahi bhartiya team se tha
 The entire world believed in the sportsmanship of the Indies team of that era
 har kisi ko yahi ummid thi ki clive loyad, viv richards, gordon greenidge, joel garnor, endi rabarts or maaikel holding jaise nami sitaron ke aage bhartiya team jaraa bhi nahin tik paaengi
 It was believed that the completion of the hat-trick of the West Indies World Cup victory was just a formality
 lekin kapil dev kii team ne kamaal karte hue final main jeet hasil kar is baat ko sabit kar diya tha ki kisi bhi match ke puraa hone ke pehle iske parinaam kaa anumaan lagaana kitna khatarnaak he

 us din mujhe pataa chalaa kii yah kitna mushkil hota he
 During this time, my photographer friend Bhaskar took this picture
 kuch samay baad maine is tasviir ko apni instagram profile par share kiya tha
 Along with the picture, i also shared the story related to it
 View this post on instagramrepost from @wildcraftin So here goes the story behind this
 Since childhood, whenever i used to visit the north and central part of Calcutta essentially, i would feel sympathetic everytime i would spot a hand pulled rickshaw, thereby choosing not to use them
 Until recently when my sympathy coincided with the realization that we're helping to earn their bread and butter only when we're taking a ride
 So last time i was in Calcutta, the # wildcraftwildling in me decided to pull a handpull rickshaw instead, to see how difficult and strenuous it really is
 i asked the rickshaw uncle to have a seat while i pulled him around on the streets of Shobhabazar, tickling the bell at intervals while the whole street stood and watched in awe
 i realized though there's a lot of mechanism involved, it wasn't a piece of cake at all
 All my years of inquistiveness transpired to salutation for the extreme precision and relentless efforts that go in during each trip made
 Yet each day they wake up with the same enthusiasm to battle the odds
 This spirit is what inspires me to be # readyforanything
