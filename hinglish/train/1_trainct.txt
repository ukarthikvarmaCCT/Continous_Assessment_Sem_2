 This is the first time that zombies are seen in an Indian film
 jombi na to bhoot he or na hi jinda shaks
 a film fantasy that looks beyond any logic
 abhi tak hollywood main jombi besd filmein banati ai thim, lekin diarector jodi raaj nidimoru or krishna dike ne ek safal koshish kii he
 He laughs at the film, is a bit intimidated and even moves the film along the lines of Hollywood
 film mindles jom-com (jombi kamedi) he
 But the directors of Bollywood do not understand why they are being relaxed in the second half after making the first half tight
 pichhali kuch filmon main aisa hi anubhav rahaa he or yahi baat thodi bahut 'go goa gon' main khatkati he
 Despite many flaws, the film is fun and these shortcomings go unnoticed
 kahani main kitna dam'go goa gon' kisi hollywood film kii tarah chalati he

 hardik (kunal khemu) naukari se haath dho baitha mastikhor yuvak jabaki bani (anand tiwari) ko offis se goa ghoomane kaa shandaar package miltaa he
 All three leave for Goa

 When it is morning, these people find themselves in an island full of zombies
 bas, yahi se shuru hoti he romaanch bhare ek safar kii kahani
 He is accompanied by zombie killer Boris (saif Ali Khan)
 jangal, samudr auki ekaakipan kaa diarector jodi ne bakhubi istemaal kiya he
 Fresh story line (bollywood wise) is cool, the story has some features but due to overall performance, it does not go unnoticed
 star apilkunal khemu jabardast he
 His oneliners are awesome
 unhone dikhaa diya he ki kamedi main unki timming jabardast he
 Veer Das's attitude is intact
 anand tiwari bhi bani ke role main kamaal ke lage hai
 While Saif Ali Khan became Boris is very interesting
 unka yah dialog to bahut hi mjedaar lagata he, lats go, keel ded pipal
 His accent really makes him smile
 puja gupta ke liye karne ko kuch zyada nahin he
 As far as zombies are concerned, they are very much frozen
 kissa kamai kamjedaar timopas he go goa gon
 The producers and directors of the film have already announced that the film has a much lower budget than Saif Ali Khan's usually made films, so it has full potential to earn well at the box office
 film kii euaspy iskaa youth oriented nechar he, mjedaar dialog hai, nayaa concept he or chartbster mujeec he

 kathavachak asaram ko jodhpur court ne naaballig ladki se rape cese main doshi tehraate hue umrakaid kii sajaa sunai he
 Her royalty Shilpi and Sharat Chandra have been sentenced to 20-20 years
 vahiin, pramukh sevadaar shiva or rasoiyaa prakaash ko court ne bari kar diya he
 As soon as the court's decision came, Asaram's supporter IPS officer DG Vanzara reached Ahmedabad ashram
 diji vanjaaraa ne kaha ki yon shoshan cese main asaram par die gaye jodhpur court ke faisle kaa vah sammaan karte hai
 Whatever decision has come after the legal process, we embark on it
 lekin unka kahana he ki unke paas peedita dwaara darj karai gai exiaar kii copy he
 In this, he has not said anywhere that he has been raped
 vanjaaraa ne kaha ki court main trial ke dauraan bhi peedita ne kabhi nahin kaha ki uske saath rape hua he
 He has said that he has been touched by bad intentions
 isi baat par baapu ji ko doshi qaraar diya gaya he
 The decision of any court is not final
 ham is faisle kaa sammaan karte hue iske khilaaf hoicourt jaaenge
 We are confident that justice will be achieved
 ilaaj ke liye ashram ai peeditaasaram par ilaaj ke liye ashram ai ek 16 saal kii naaballig ladki se balaatkaar kaa aarope he
 According to the victim's family, 5 years ago, the victim's family sent their two children to study at the Gurukul of Chhindwara in Asaram
 7 agast 2013 ko peedita ke pita ko chhindwara gurukul se ne beti ke biimaar hone kii khabar di
 The next day, when the victim's parents reached Chhindwara Gurukul, they were accused of rape in Kutia
 unhen bataaya gaya ki unki beti par bhoot-pret kaa saaya he
 Only Asaram can cure it
 14 agast ko peedita kaa parivaar asaram se milane unke jodhpur ashram pahunchaa
 On the evening of 15 August, Asaram called and raped her in the hut on the pretext of curing the victim
 dilli main darj karaayaa tha kesaiske baad puraa parivaar ghar waapas lautaa, to 17 agast ko ladki ne apane gharavaalon ko sari baat bataai
 Meanwhile, he came to know that Asaram is camping at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi from 18 to 20 August
 lihaaja puraa parivaar dilli pahunch gaya or unhone ramlila maidan ke paas kamala market thane main cese darj kara di
 The arrest was made from Indore ashram where a zero FIR was lodged
 iske baad is cese ko jodhpur transfar kar diya gaya
 But the Jodhpur police was afraid to lay hands on Asaram
 peedit parivaar ne haar nahin maani
 After the news came in the media, the pressure on the government and the police increased
 is tarah 16 din baad asaram ko indore ashram se giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The powerful hands of former Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni have made the team the winner in many matches and it is perhaps no surprise that they have the confidence to send the ball across the boundary line even after back pain
 maidan par dhoni ne karai massage, mouj lete rahe yuvaraj, dekhen videoloypteda shot ke liye ballebaaj ko sharir is tarah rakhana hota he ki vajan shot par ho
 Although Dhoni was troubled by injury in the IPL match played against Kings XI Punjab on Sunday, he was still sending the ball easily across the boundary line
 dhoni kii 44 gend main naabad 79 ran kii tabadatod pari ke boote super kings kii team lakshya ke kaaphi kareeb pahunch gai thi, haalanki team chaar ran se match haar gai
 When Dhoni was asked how he was hitting lofted shots even after back pain, Dhoni said, 'the back position is very bad due to the pain, but God has given me strength and i have to play back No need to use too much
 mere haath ye kaam kar sakate hai
 'IPL: Rahul said- Gayle's return to form, bad news for other teams, but Dhoni said that it is not a very serious injury
 unhone kaha, ‘ yah bahut bura nahin hona chahie kyonki mujhe pataa he kya hua he
 When you know about the severity of your injury, you know how bad it is

 71 rupee or 69
 32 per liter
 isse pehle shuukravaar ko petrol 6 paise prati litre sasta hua tha jabaki guuruuvaar ko dijal ke bhav main badhotaree hui thi 
 Why the prices may increase According to market experts, the Organization of Petroleum Exports Countries, a group of oil exporting countries, has cut the oil price due to the reduction in oil supply by OPEC

 All these challenges can also have an impact on the Indian market and oil companies can increase the price of petrol and diesel

 in donon ne is maidan par bharat ke liye kisi bhi wicket ke liye sabase badi saajhedaari ko anjaam diya he
 Earlier this record was in the name of Chetan Chauhan and Sunil Gavaskar, who added 165 runs for the first wicket in 1981

 aisa kaha jaataa rahaa he ki mahilaayein muskuraakar apana kaam karwaanaa jaanati hai, lekin ek nae adhyayan main daawa kiya gaya he ki purush kisi mahila ko dekhakar muskura den, to ve baaki purushon ke mukaable unase manachaaha kaam karwaane main zyada sakasham hai
 Effect of other mood swings In three experiments, researchers studied how the effect of a man's smile on a woman's perception of him and his own mood swings
 is prayog main kai jagah purush prabhavi bhoomika main tha or vah mahilaon ko nirdesh detaa tha
 It was found in the experiment that if he smiled at the women, then the women would mostly accept him
 muskaan dekhakar vinamr ho jaati hai mahilaayendeli mail kii khabar ke anusaar, yah baat tab bhi lagu thi, jab vah muskuraane ke baad koi behad kaamuk baat bhi boli jaae
 This study conducted by the University of Granada, Spain, also found that when men smile at women, they tend to behave more politely
 baatcheet main mitrataa kaa bhaavshaareerik bhav-bhangimaaon kii jaankaar pati wood ne kaha ki is adhyayan ke nishkarsh thodaa pareshaan karne vaale bhi the kyonki mahilaayein purushon kii tulana main apane faisle karne ke liye shaareerik bhangimaaon par zyada nirbhar karti hai
 He said, 'even if there is no harmony between what is being said and physical gestures, women will still look at the body
 agar unhen muskaan najar aati he to unhen yah baatcheet bahut mithravat lagati he
 'while advising women, Wood says that they should be conscious of their behavior and not just look at the physical expressions of the man
 jo mahilaayein purushon kii muskaan ke bahekaave main nahin aana chaahatin, unhen purush se milte samay milane kii vajah ko puri tarah yaad rakhana chahie
 She also says that you should avoid smiling too much yourself
 unhone kaha, ‘jawaab dene se pehle purush ke maukhik sandesh par gaur karen ki aakhir kaha kya gaya he
 If he says something erotic and you smile at him, it means that he could talk such things

 The French government has said that the French government had no role in choosing who would be the Indian partner of the company making Rafale
 lekin unhone is baat kaa khandan nahin kiya ki francwa oland kaa bayaan galat he ki ambani kaa naam bharat sarkaar kii taraf se aayaa
 The French newspaper was investigating whether the Indian company had paid for the film of François Hollande's Sakhi, whether it was related to the Rafael deal

 Two days before his visit, an agreement was reached in the film case

 The Congress today showed the video in which the CEO of Dasso Aviation is clearly saying that you can imagine my satisfaction after hearing from the chairman of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited that we have agreed to share the responsibilities
 jis din kaa yah video he wo taarikh he 25 march 2015
 Deal is 10 April 2015
 yani 15 din pehle dasso aviation ke siio hindustan aironotics limited kaa naam le rahe hai
 The Congress has raised the same question that on March 25, the CEO of Dasso is taking the name of HAL
 phir 15 din main echeel kaa naam kaise cat gaya
 Not only this, on March 8, two days before the Prime Minister's visit, the then Foreign Secretary Jaishankar said that my understanding about Rafal is that there is a discussion between the French company, our Ministry of Defense and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
 congress netaa abhishek manu singhvi ne isi baat ko lekar sawaal uthaae hai ki 25 march ko echeel he, 8 march ko echeel he lekin 10 april ko echeel nahin he
 How did this happen, why did it happen

 Earlier too, this group of Congress leaders went to the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, CAG

 raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne kaha he ki bijepi desh bhar main is masale par press conference karegi or congress ke jhooth kaa pardaafash karegi
 The Minister of State for Agriculture brought Robert Vadra into the dispute
 robert wadra ke kareebi sanjay bhandari ko phayda pahunchane ke liye congress rafel deal radd karaane kii saazish rach rahi he
 Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad tweeted a Times of India report dated February 13, 2012, stating that there was an agreement between Rafale Aircraft and Reliance Defense when the UPA was in power
 bijepi ne bhi is report ko twit kiya tha
 Alt News has investigated its veracity and published the full report on its website
 2012 main reliance industry limited ne dasso ke saath qaraar kiya tha jiske pramukh mukesh ambani hai
 Anil Ambani's group name is Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group
 is group kii company kaa naam he reliance dephence
 Reliance Defense has nothing to do with Reliance Industry Limited
 lekin 2012 main rafel ke chune jane ke baad dasso aviation or mukesh ambani kii company ke bich baatcheet shuru hui thi
 This company of Mukesh Ambani is of 2008
 magar dasso ke saath baatcheet qaraar main nahin badal saki
 Alt News has revealed this
 2014 main reliance industry raksha kaarobaar se peeche hi hat gai
 Therefore, bjp's claim that Reliance Industry Limited had signed the agreement is wrong
 tippaniyan Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said that the matter will not be investigated by a joint committee of Parliament
 sieji or sivisi jaanch karegi
 BJP is linking Congress's questions with Pakistan that Pakistan is very happy
 is vivaad se pakistan ko phayda hone ja rahaa he
 The question is how the name of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited was changed to Ambani's company which has no experience in making fighter aircraft
 hindustan aironotics limited ke bare main bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki vah bhi apana order samay par puraa nahin kar paati he lekin jis sarkari company kaa naam 25 march 2015 se lekar 8 april 2015 tak baar baar aata he, uskaa kaa naam 10 april 2015 kii deal se kaise gaayab ho jaataa he
 This is the case
 abhi tak sarkaar yaa bijepi yahi kahati rahi he ki rafel company kaa apana chunaav he ki kisase qaraar kare
 But since François Hollande has said that the Government of India gave the name of Anil Ambani's company, the questions become stronger than ever
 is vivaad ke maddenjar dasso company ne bayaan jari kar kaha ki hamane reliance dephence kaa chayan kiya he
 Dasso has partnered with Reliance Group as per the Make in India policy
 france sarkaar ne yahi kaha he ki rafel banane vaali company kaa bhartiya saajheedaar koun hoga, iske chayan main france kii sarkaar kii koi bhoomika nahin thi
 But he did not deny that François Hollande's statement is wrong that Ambani's name came from the Indian government
 france kaa akhbaar is baat kii jaanch kar rahaa tha ki francwa oland kii sakhi kii film ke liye bhartiya company ne paisa diya he to kya uskaa sambandh rafel deal se he
 In January 2016, François Hollande became the chief guest for Republic Day
 unke daure se do din pehle film vaale maamle main qaraar hua tha
 It can be investigated in India also how this agreement was signed between Anil Ambani's film and French film
 kya anil ambani ne khud se isaki pahal kii thi yaa french film company ne unase pahal kii thi
 Anil Ambani's film has invested in Kis Kis and foreign films
 'hamaare paas partner chunane kaa koi vikalp nahin tha
 The Government of India proposed Reliance
 dasso ne ambani ke saath samjhauta kiya
 We had no choice
 ham us madhyasth ke saath kaam kar rahe the jo hamen diya gaya tha
 i cannot even imagine that it would be related to the film Julie
 ' francwa oland ne abhi tak iskaa khandan nahin kiya he
 Now come to politics
 congress ne aaj us video ko dikhaaya jisamen dasso aviation ke siio saaf saaf bol rahe hai ki hindustan aironotics limited ke chayaraman se sunakar aap mere santosh kii kalpana kar sakate hai ki ham zimmedaariyaan saajha karne par sahamat ho gaye hai
 The date of this video is 25 March 2015
 deal hoti he 10 april 2015
 That is 15 days ago, the CEO of Dasso Aviation is taking the name of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
 congress ne yahi sawaal uthaaya he ki 25 march ko dasso ke siio to echeel kaa naam le rahe hai
 Then how did hal's name get cut in 15 days
 yahi nahin pradhanmantri ke daure se do din pehle yani 8 march ko tab ke videsh sachiv jaishankar ne kaha tha ki rafaal ko lekar meri samaj yah he ki french company, hamaara raksha mantralay or hindustan aironotics limited ke bich charchaa chal rahi he
 Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi has raised questions about the fact that March 25 is HAL, March 8 is HAL but April 10 is not HAL
 yah kaise hua, kyon hua
 Congress leaders went to the Central Vigilance Commission office today and met the CVC and demanded an inquiry into the Rafale case
 iske pehle bhi congress ke netaaon kaa yah samooh bharat ke niyantrak va mahalekhapareekshak sieji ke daftar gaya tha
 Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ahmed Patel, Anand Sharma, Kapil Sibal, Vivek Tankha, Manish Tiwari, Pramod Tiwari, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Jairam Ramesh and Randeep Surjewala and Pranav Jha met VC Chaudhary of CVC and gave memorandum
 anand sharma ne sivisi se sabhi kagaz zabt karne or exiaar kii maang kii he
 On the other hand, in Amethi, Rahul Gandhi again targeted the Prime Minister on Rafael
 udhar bijepi bhi puri tarah se taiyaar he
 Today, Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Shekhawat came to press conference

 Khair has written a blog before Finance Minister Jaitley
 press main bayaan de chuke hai
 Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said that the BJP will hold a press conference across the country on this issue and expose the lies of the Congress
 krishi rajya mantri is vivaad main robert wadra ko le aae
 In order to benefit Sanjay Bhandari, close to Robert Vadra, the Congress is plotting to cancel the Rafale deal
 kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne 13 farvari 2012 ke times of india kii ek report twit karte hue kaha tha ki upie jab satta main thi tab rafel aircraft or reliance dephence ke bich samjhauta hua tha
 The BJP also tweeted this report
 alt news ne isaki satyata kii jaanch kii he or puri report apni website par prakashit kii he
 In 2012, Reliance Industry Limited signed an agreement with Dasso, headed by Mukesh Ambani
 anil ambani ke samooh kaa naam reliance anil dhirubhai ambani group he
 The company name of this group is Reliance Defense
 reliance dephence kaa reliance industry limited se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 But after Rafael was elected in 2012, negotiations started between Dasso Aviation and Mukesh Ambani's company
 mukesh ambani kii yah company 2008 kii he
 Negotiations with Dasso could not be turned into an agreement
 ye alt news ne khulaasa kiya he
 In 2014, Reliance Industries withdrew from the defense business
 isliye bijepi kaa yah daawa ki reliance industry limited ne samjhauta par dastakhat kiya tha galat he
 The comments raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne kaha he ki is maamle kii jaanch sansad kii sanyukt samiti se nahin karai jaaegi
 The CAG and CVC will investigate
 bijepi congress ke sawaalon ko pakistan se jod rahi he ki pakistan bahut khush he
 Pakistan is going to benefit from this dispute
 sawaal he ki hindustan aironotics limited kaa naam kaat kar ambani kii company kaa naam kaise aa gaya jiskaa koi anubhav nahin he ladaaku vimaan banane ke maamle main
 It is also being said about Hindustan Aeronautics Limited that it is not able to complete its order on time but the name of the government company which appears again and again from 25 March 2015 to 8 April 2015, is 10 April 2015
 How to disappear from the deal baat itani si he
 Till now the government or BJP has been saying that Rafale Company has its own election with whom to sign the agreement
 lekin francwa oland ne jab se yah kaha he ki anil ambani kii company kaa naam bharat sarkaar ne diya tab se sawaal pehle se adhik pukhta ho jate hai
 In view of this controversy, the Dasso company issued a statement saying that we have selected Reliance Defense
 mek in india kii niti ke anuroop dasso ne reliance group ke saath partnership kii he
 'we had no option to choose a partner
 bharat kii sarkaar ne hi reliance ko prastaavit kiy
 Dasso made a pact with Ambani

 Shashank Manohar has become the BCCI chief again
 aaj bisisiai kii aam sabha kii vishesh baithak main unhen nirvirodh duusari baar adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaa gaya
 He has held the post of President from 2008 to 2011
 unhen east jone ke sabhi sadasyon kaa samarthan mila
 The special thing is that no one had nominated against Manohar
 shashaank jagmohan daalamia ke nidhan ke baad yah jimmedaari sanbhaalenge
 In fact, all six units of the East Zone had unanimously proposed Manohar's candidature, which is also a sign of the diminishing dominance of former chief n Srinivasan in board politics
 manohar isse pehle 2008-2009 or 2010-2011 ke bich teen saal bisisiai adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 Manohar's appointment means that Srinivasan is now less likely to return to the BCCI by 2017, as Vidarbha's tenure will end in the same year
 bisisiai kii aam sabha kii vishesh baithak main adhyaksh pad par manohar kii niyukti mahaj aupchaarikta bachi thi, kyonki namakan farm kii samiksha ke baad pataa chalaa tha ki purv kshetra kii sabhi chah ikaayiyon ne prastaav ke rup main alag-alag hastakshar kiye the
 In the BCCI by-election, Manohar needed only one proposer from the East Zone, while he got the approval of all six unions
 tippaniyan Among the proponents of Manohar's name was Abhishek, son of the late Dalmiya, who represented his family club National Cricket Club (NCC) at a special meeting of the General Assembly
 haalanki shrinivasana ne is baithak main hissaa nahin liya
 Apart from this, Manohar's name was proposed by Saurav Ganguly from Bengal, Sourav Dasgupta from Tripura, Gautam Rai from Assam, Ashirwad Behera from Odisha and Sanjay Singh from Jharkhand
 purv kshetra ke ek pratinidhi ne kaha, 'purv kshetra kii sabhi chah ikaayiyon ne alag alag manohar ke naam kaa prastaav rakhaa, jo darshata he ki ve unki ummidavaari kaa puri tarah se samarthan kar rahe hai
 ' bengal cricket sangh ke bhavi adhyaksh saurav ganguli or maharashtra cricket sangh ke pramukh ajay shirke ne kaha tha ki manohar is pad ke liye upyukt ummidavaar hai
 Ganguly said, 'shashank Manohar has led the BCCI in the past and is a capable man
 mujhe yakeen he ki vah acha kaam karenge
 Shirke said, "he is the right candidate
" purv kshetra kii sabhi chah ikaayiyon ne unke naam kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 He is very experienced and honest
 unki prishthbhumi kanoon se judi he or is samay unase behatar ummidavaar nahin ho saktaa
 ' darasal, east jone kii sabhi chah ikaayiyon ne sarvasammati se manohar kii ummidavaari kaa prastaav diya tha, jo board kii raajnneeti main purv pramukh en shrinivasana ke ghatate dabadabe kaa bhi sanket he
 Manohar had earlier served as the BCCI President for three years between 2008-2009 and 2010-2011
 manohar kii niyukti kaa matlab he ki shrinivasana ke ab bisisiai main 2017 tak vaapasi kii sambhaavna behad kam he, kyonki usee saal vidarbha ke is prashaasak kaa kaarykaal khatm hoga
 The appointment of Manohar to the post of Chairman at a special meeting of the BCCI General Assembly was a mere formality as it was revealed after reviewing the nomination form that all the six units of the erstwhile region had signed separately as proposals
 bisisiai ke up chunaav main manohar ko purv kshetra se sirf ek prastaavak kii jarurat thi, jabaki unhone sabhi chah sanghon kii sweekruti mili
 The comments manohar ke naam ke prastaavkon main ek divangat daalamia ke bete abhishek bhi rahe, jinhone aam sabha kii vishesh baithak main apane paariwarik club neshnal cricket club (ensisi) kaa pratinidhitiv kiya
 However, Srinivasan did not attend this meeting
 iske alaava manohar ke naam kaa prastaav bengal se saurav ganguli, tripura se saurav dasgupta, assam ne gautam raay, odisha se aashirwad behda or jharkhand se sanjay singh ne rakhaa tha
 a representative of the East Zone said, 'all the six units of the East Zone proposed different Manohar's names, indicating that they are fully supporting his candidature
 ' Saurav Ganguly, the future president of Bengal Cricket Association and Ajay Shirke, head of Maharashtra Cricket Association, had said that Manohar is a suitable candidate for the post
 ganguli ne kaha, 'shashaank manohar ne ateet main bisisiai kii aguai kii he or vah sakasham vyakti hai
 i am sure he will do a good job
 ' vahiin shirke ne kaha, 'vah sahi ummidavaar hai
 All the six units in the East Zone have proposed his name
 vah kaaphi anbhavi or eemaandaar hai
 His background is related to law and at this time there cannot be a better candidate than him
 ' Manohar had earlier served as the BCCI President for three years between 2008-2009 and 2010-2011
 manohar kii niyukti kaa matlab he ki shrinivasana ke ab bisisiai main 2017 tak vaapasi kii sambhaavna behad kam he, kyonki usee saal vidarbha ke is prashaasak kaa kaarykaal khatm hoga

 Team India captain Cool Mahendra Singh Dhoni has a habit of winning the winning shot
 jab bhi mauka miltaa he dhoni chakka jadkar team india ko jeet kaa sehara jarur pahanaate hai
 But in the semi-final match of the T20 World Cup, Dhoni made a big sacrifice for his brave batsman Virat Kohli
 dhoni kaa 'balidaan'is match main dhoni ke paas ek baar phir mauka tha vijayi shot khilne kaa lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya
 With a single off the last ball of the 19th over, Dhoni could have won Team India
 lekin hendericks kii aakhri gend par dhoni bina ran liye khadey rahe jisase aakhri over main vining shot khilne kaa mauka viraat ko mil jaae or viraat ne bhi dhoni ke is gift ko dil kholkar kabool kiya
 Winning shot of Virat's four, Dale Steyn came in to do the 20th over and Virat hit a big four off his first ball to give Team India the victory
 us samay jeet ke liye team india ko 1 ran kii hi darkaar thi
 Virat played a brilliant innings of 72 off 44 balls and also hit 5 fours and 2 sixes during this period
 
 
 
 So that is why Dhoni did not take Ranvirat Kohli as Man of the Match
 match ke baad pregentation ke dauraan dhoni ne bataaya ki aakhir kyon unhone aakhri gend par ran nahin liya tha
 Dhoni said- 'virat's presence at number-3 is fantastic for the team
 har kisi ke paas usase seekhney ke liye kuch na kuch he
 The best i could do for Virat was to give him a chance to play the winning shot and that is why i did not take the last ball of the 19th over
 'dhoni kii captaini main nahin haare hai semifinal main
 
 
 Team India has not lost any of the semi-final matches played under Dhoni's captaincy till date
 dhoni kii captaini main agar team semifinal tak pahunchi he to final main jarur gai he

 We depend on our bones for every small and big movement of the body
 haddiyaan hamaare sharir ke puure bhaar ko sambhalati hai
 With the help of this we are able to stand, sit and walk
 jab ham jawan hote hai to inhen mahatv nahin dete hai, lekin jab hamaari umr badaae lagati he to saadhaaran se kaam bhi hamaare liye mushkil hone lagate hai, kyonki tab hamaari haddiyaan kamjor hone lagati hai
 Our average lifespan has increased due to advances in medicine
 iske saath hi umr se judi osteoporosis jaisi swasthya samasyaon kaa boj bhi bad gaya he
 Going to the literal meaning of osteoporosis, it means "wrinkled bones"
 ” ye haddiyaan itani kamjor ho jaati hai ki jaraa-si chot lagane se bhi tut sakati hai
 The cost of treating such fractures is also high
 isse marij ke jivan par bhi nakaaratmak asar padataa he
 Women suffer more from osteoporosis than men, especially after menstruation stops
 adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki bharatiyon khaskar nimna aay varg ke logon main osteoporosis kii vajah se hone vaale fracture, pashchimi deshon ke logon ke mukaable kam umr main dekhe jate hai
 Studies by the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, show that socially and economically weaker women, on average, suffer a hip fracture at the age of 57, while among women in affluent households, it is 75 years old
 
 kuulhe ke fracture ke alaava osteoporosis kii vajah se ridh kii haddi main micro-fracture bhi hote hai, jinaki vajah se peeth dard kii shikaayat rahati he
 In most cases of spinal fractures, the patient often does not know because back pain is not taken so seriously here that we should be treated
 osteoporosis chupchaap sharir main chhipakar rahane vaala rog he or isamen kisi chetavanee yaa sanket bina hi vyakti ko fracture jhelana pad jaataa he
 Osteoporosis can be detected in time through mineral density (which indicates strength)
 iske liye khaas tarah kii mashin duel energy eks-re ebsorpateometry (dexe) kaa istemaal hota he
 People moving towards old age have to suffer from osteoporosis, but its seeds have been sown only during early age
 bachapan se kishor umr main pahunchane tak bacchon kii haddiyaan lagaataar majboot ho rahi hoti hai kyonki is dauraan bone mineral dencity badhati he
 It is at its peak by the age of 20, which is called peak bone mass
 uske baad bone maas main vruddhi kii koi sambhaavna nahin rahati
 Peak bone mass is not formed in sufficient quantity in the body when it reaches puberty when nutritional supplements are not received during childhood and adolescence
 umr badaae ke saath bone mineral main kami aane lagati he or isi ke saath osteoporosis kii takalif shuru hone lagati he, jisase judi dikkatein badaae lagati hai
 How to prevent this disease that continuously weakens the body? a balanced diet with adequate doses of calcium along with vitamin d and protein, and regular hard work or exercise can prevent osteoporosis
 iske alaava, motopa dur rakhkar or cigarette tathaa sharaab se parhez kar haddiyon ko majboot or tandoorust rakhane kii disha main kargar kadam uthaae ja sakate hai
 Calcium is one of the most important minerals that make bones
 calcium ke sroton main doodh, dahi, paneer, cheez jaise deyari utpaada; paalak or laal saag jaisi patteydaar subjiyan; raajma or chanaa daal; til or jira, kaali mirch or laung jaise masaale shaamil hai
 Along with the amount of calcium it is also important what its source is
 doodh main bharpoor calcium he jo aasaani se pachataa he or hamaare bone ke mineral maas ko badhaane main madad karata he
 On the other hand, greens and green vegetables also provide calcium but they are less than dairy products, so it is very important to include milk in the diet to give the body plenty of calcium
 calcium kaa avasorana (abjorpshan) vitamin di par nirbhar karata he
 Reports from various parts of the country suggest that a large population of Indians is suffering from vitamin d deficiency
 hamaare desh main jahaan suraj baarah maheene chamakta he, vahaan aisi baat hairaan karti he kyonki suraj kii kirnon main vitamin di kii bharpoor maatra maujuud he
 Actually how many of us spend at least 15 minutes in the sun? But pollution is also a reason behind this, due to which the ultraviolet rays do not reach us directly which helps in absorbing the vitamin d inside our skin optimally
 aahaar ke alaava shaareerik mehnat bhi haddiyon ke vikaas or unki takat ko banaae rakhane main ahm bhoomika nibhaati he
 By walking fast, running, climbing ladders and dancing, the strength of bones remains and they are not weak
 saath hi mansapeshiyon kii majbootee bhi bani rahati he
 Today the average age has already increased
 log pehle kii apehna zyada umr tak jeene lage hai isliye aabaadi main umradraj logon kii maujuudagi ke hisaab se osteoporosis main badhotaree hone kii sambhaavna najar aa rahi he
 Therefore, to prevent osteoporosis, attention needs to be given to nutrition
 acchhee-khaasi maatra main calcium lene ke liye deyari utpaadon ko sasti keemat par uplabdh karana hoga or calcium ke nae or saste strot talashne honge
 The direction of our strategy should be focused on the young people, with a focus on the development of maximum bone mass in the body of children and adolescents and reducing the weakening of bones due to age in older people
 in upayon ke jariye hi ham desh main mahamari kaa rup leti haddiyon kii in bimariyon ko munhtod jawaab de sakate hai or aane vaali peedi ko acha bhavishya saunp sakate hai

 "the strength of Indian thinking has been inclusive

 As soon as the announcement of demonetisation on 8 November was made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there was a cry for money
 bitate vakt main jab kuch baat naa bani to pradhanmantri ne digital pement kaa idia sujhaayaa
 At the same time, BHIM App was born on 30 December 2016
 jise ab tak 15 million baar downlod kiya ja chukaa he
 But do you know who made it and in how much time? agar nahin to aapako bataa den ki is ap ko 27 saal ke nikhil kumaar (head of develper echosystem, india stack) or unki team ne keval teen hafton main puri tarah banaakar sarkaar ko pesh kar diya tha
 If you put the smartphone in charging anywhere, then private photos can be taken
 The option of USSD and UPI was available when the leak-led central government thought about going digital
 lekin piem ko ye samaj aa gaya ki aise shabd logon ke man main kanfusion paidaa karte hai or ek aasaan pement methd kii zarurat he
 Then in the last week of November planning was done about the app and this led to the birth of BHIM
 jab sarkaar kii taraf se ap ko puri tarah banane ke samay ke bare main nikhil or unki team se main poocha gaya to nikhil ne jawaab main kaha ki chalo ise teen hafton main banaaya jaae
 Initially, there was some confusion due to the fact that the government staff considered three weeks for three years
 launch se pehle najar ai Skoda kii limited adishan octavianikila ne bangaleru main ek kaarykram main bolte huue bataaya ki pehle hafte main hamane ap kii digining or prototiping jaise kaam kiye baaki do hafte main ap ko develop kiya gaya
 Finally, on 25 December, Nikhil's team presented BHIM to the PMO and the Niti Aayog
 un dinon ko yaad karte hue nikhil bataate hai ki ham sabhi bahut utsahit the, niti ayog ke IT secretary badal kar ayog ke CEO banane ja rahe the
 He said that this game will be chasing, we have to launch the app dramatically
 sabase mjedaar baat ye thi ki BHIM naam khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ne diya tha
 The average age of the team members who made the app was between 24-27 years and Nikhil was their team head
 sansad main ek saansad ko neend kya ai, jaise puraa desh jaag uthaa
 It was becoming difficult for people to believe that when an important issue was being discussed in the Lok Sabha, their mps were found sleeping
 rahul gandhi bajet satr main mahangaai par charchaa ke dauraan pehle to jamhai lete, phir sir jhukaakar sote paae gaye
 Yawning is a natural process for a person
 aakhir rahul gandhi bhi haad-maance ke bane insaan hai
 While forgetting that the 'yuvraj' of the Congress was found sleeping in the House in this way, we forget that last night very few people have slept deeply
 log footbal worldcup ke semifinal main brazil ko jitate dekhnaa chaahate honge, jo shaayad niyati ko manjuur nahin tha
 
 
 One may raise the question whether the Lok Sabha has a place left for these political parties to sleep? Instead of thinking of a sharp answer to this, we should definitely see that when there is business going on in Parliament, then there is wonderful peace
 jab sadan main kisi jwalanth masale par charchaa hoti he, to vahaan bahut kam sadsy maujuud hote hai
 Consider, Rahul was not able to fall asleep when the rest of the members were making noise in the well by taking a postponement on some minor matter! 
 
 sadan kaa kaamkaaj sucharu rup se chal rahaa tha
 Remember, what happens there when the work is being done in an ideal situation in Parliament
 
 
 vahaan sirf baat hi to ho rahi hoti he
 You give this conversation the name of 'speech'
 jise bolnaa hota he, aksar vahi vahaan maujuud hota he
 If you notice, Rahul Gandhi slept right behind the member who is giving a speech
 
 
 
 So that was the perfect time to take a nap
 yah na to pehla maamla he or na aakhir, jab koi sadsy sadan ke bheetar jamhai lete hue neend kii agosh main chalaa gaya ho
 The Lok Sabha also has a habit of sleeping in the House like Himachal Pradesh CM Virbhadra Singh
 virbhadra jab sadan main aate hai, to puri tatparta ke saath so jate hai
 He was a minister
 sone vaale main piem sahab bhi
 
 
 Today, when Rahul Gandhi was making headlines, Modi's minister Santosh Gangwar was taking a nap
 echdi devgauda bhi aisi jagah sokar naam kama chuke hai, jo kam se kam sone ke liye to nahin hi bani he
 Recently, a photo of Digvijay Singh went viral when he was found sleeping on a stage with CM Siddaramaiah of Karnataka
 jab digvijay ko ai manch par neendjra sochie, siyasatdanon ko dher saare kaam nipataane hote hai
 They have to attend many meetings
 inamen se kai to ahale subah, jabaki kai der raat ko hote hai
 They are sometimes 'caught' during these first and last meetings
 jab congress ke yuvaraj sote paae gaye, to ye shor kaisaa? kripaya shanti banaae rakhen, kahin ve jaag na jaaen
 
 
 Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, who came to Lucknow for two days, met many people on his tour, but one of these meetings remains a topic of discussion in Lucknow
 wo mulaakaat thi mahila samajasevi or ol india muslim vuman personal lau board kii adhyaksh shysta ambar se
 Shaista Amber gave the invitation on Tuesday, in the area where Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat had a program, Shaista Amber lives in the same area and also does social work
 aresas se jude logon ne jab shysta ko kaarykram main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa diya to shysta taiyaar ho gayi or program khatm hone ke baad unhone sangh pramukh se alag se mulaakaat bhi kii
 Shaista Ambarshaista, who attended the program, said that she was impressed by Mohan Bhagwat's ideas and invited her to visit the mosque, which Bhagwat accepted
 shysta ne kaha ki mail jol badha kar samaaj main nafrat or duriyon ko kam kiya ja saktaa he or sangh pramukh se mulaakaat kar wo logon ko yahi sandesh dena chaahatin thim
 Impressed by the speech, Shaista Ambar said- 'where i live there are also people living near the RSS
 ham unke kaaryakramon main hissaa lete hai or ve hamaare kaaryakramon main aate hai chaahe rashtriya parv ho, saamaajik ho yaa dharmik ho
 So those people had given us a feast that Mohan Bhagwat ji is coming
 mujhe bahut acha laga ki aap logon ne hamen isamen bhi shaamil kiya
 i heard his speech and i liked it
 unhone samaaj sudhaarney kii baaten kahin
 Asked the doctors to make their treatment cheaper
 unhone hindutv kii koi baat nahin kahi
 Neither said anything that spoke of isolation
 to main prabhavit hui
 'bhagwat did the promise
 Ambaar said-' It comes in the media that the RSS talks of secession
 aresas yaa duusare sanghathanon main kuch log aise ho sakate hai jo algaav kii, sampradayikta yaa jatvaad kii baat karte hon
 Talk of breaking or harming society
 par unke saath mujhe aisa bilkul nahin laga
 i met her and praised her speech
 maine apni likhi ek kitaab bhi unhen di
 We told them what work we do and called in our mosque
 us masjid main sabhi dharmon ke log aate hai or kaarykram bhi hote hai
 So he said that he is busy today but he will come again sometime

 The litchi crop has been ruined in Bihar due to weather woes
 isse ek ore jahaan fal utpaadakon main niraashaa he, vahiin fal main keede lagane or kharaab gunvattta ke chalate is baar raashtrapati, pradhanmantri sahit anya ganmaanya log iske shahi swaad se maharoom rah jaaenge, kyonki har saal kii tarah unhen lajjatdaar or rasabhari lichi nahin bheji ja sakegi
 Muzaffarpur District Magistrate Anupam Kumar said that this time due to hailstorm during unseasonal rains, the fruit of the litchi has become insects and due to poor quality, the royal litchi sent from here to other dignitaries including the President and Prime Minister is The bar is not being sent
 unhone kaha ki is bare main rajya sarkaar ko suchit kar diya gaya he
 It has been a tradition that every year, the taste of the royal litchi of Bihar has been sent from Muzaffarpur to Bihar Bhawan in Delhi for tasting the President and other dignitaries
 anupam ne kaha ki ganmaanya logon ko mujffarpur se lichi bhejne kii puraani parampara ke anusaar is baar bhi is baar bhi isaki gunvattta parakhane ke liye rashtriya lichi anusandhan centre kii mujffarpur ikai ke vaigyanik ko bulaayaa gaya tha
 He has suggested not to send it to dignitaries this time due to poor quality of lychee
 unhone kaha ki lichi kii fasal barbaad hone ko lekar kisaan or vyapaaree bhi pareshaan hai or unhen kaaphi aarthik nuksaan hua he
 Anupam said that litchi belongs to the perennial crop
 iske nuksaan ko lekar survey kara liya gaya he jin kisaanon kii 33 pratishat se adhik lichi kii fasal barbaad hogi, unhen fasal kshati muaavja milegaa
 Bhola Nath Jha, a lychee farmer from Muzaffarpur, blames the high-intensity earthquake on April 25 and the after shakes that have been responsible for the litchi crop devastation
 unke anusaar bukamp se pedo ke hill jane se uske feader roots kshatigrast ho gaye
 However, Vishal Nath, director of the Muzaffarpur unit of the National Lychee Research Center, said that there are no scientific examples in the past of the worms and the quality of the lychee fruit falling due to the earthquake and if it is due to the earthquake then the mango crop Should have been affected by it too, because its feeder roots are one to one and a half meters below ground like lychees
 tippaniyan Litchi production in the country is around six lakh tonnes and Bihar is the leading state in its production
 bihar main kareeb 31 hajaar hectayar main lichi ugaai jaati he or iskaa yahaan salanaa utpaadan kareeb teen lakh ton he
 In Muzaffarpur district, which is famous in the country and the world for the production of royal litchi, litchi is grown in about 8 thousand hectares and its annual production here is more than 50 thousand tons
 bihar main aamtaur par shahi or chyna lichi kaa utpaadan hota he or iske bagan mujffarpur, samastipur vaishali, purvi champaran, pashchimi champaran, begusarai, katihaar, purniya, bhagalpur aadi jilon main he

 That is why i am resigning from my post

 yah behad galat hoga ki party kii haar ke liye sabko jimmedaar tehraaya jaae, lekin party adhyaksh hone kii vajah se main apni jimmedaari se bhaagun
 Many colleagues suggested that i should choose the name of the next president of the Congress Party
 yah sahi he ki kisi kii tatkaal jarurat he ki koi hamaari party ko lead kare
 It would be wrong for me to select one

 rahul gandhi ne rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot or madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath par party se zyada beton ko mahatv dene kaa bhi aarope lagaaya tha
 He expressed his displeasure at both the leaders
 tab se lekar ab tak lagaataar party ke bade netaa or kaaryakarta rahul gandhi ko manaane kii koshish kar rahe the, lekin rahul gandhi apane jid par ade rahe
 In front of the Congress party headquarters on Tuesday, party workers were demonstrating that Rahul Gandhi withdrew his resignation
 lekin rahul gandhi ne apana faisla nahin badla
 Now sources say that the interim president of the Congress will be Motilal Vora
 tab tak nae congress adhyaksh kii talaashi jari rahegi
 It seems Congress Party doesn't want my services anymore
 i had recommended just one name in Mumbai for Assembly election
 Heard that even that has been rejected
 As i had told the leadership earlier,in that case i will not participate in poll campaign
 Its my final decision
 iske alaava sanjay nirupam ne ek or twit main likhaa, 'mujhe ummid he ki party ko gudby kehane kaa vakt nahin aayega, But the way the leadership is treating me, it seems that the day is not far off
 ' i hope that the day has not yet come to say good bye to party

 Nirmal Verma has no qualms in writing modern prose in Hindi fiction and writing poetic prose on foreign fabric and surroundings
 vah bhartiya manisha kii us ujjwal parampara ke pratik-purush hai, jinke jivan main karm, chintan or aasthaa ke bich koi phaak nahin rah jaati
 The heart of art becomes the truth of life and the challenge of faith is the test of life
 vah nai kahani andolan ke dhwajvahakon main shumaar the
 He was born on 3 April 1929 in Shimla and died on 25 October 2005 in New Delhi
 kaha jaataa he ki unke samakalinon or baad ke rachanakaaron main shaayad hi koi aisa he, jisane nirmal verma se kuch na liya ho
 He was a writer Manishi, who gives and demands for his being
 apane jeevankaal main galat samajhe janaa uski niyati he or usase bedaag ubar aana uskaa puraskaar
 Both of them also came up well in Nirmal Verma's part
 apane jeevankaal main nirmal verma sahitya ke lagbhag sabhi shreshth sammaanon se samaadrut hue, jinamein 1985 main sahitya academy puraskaar, 1999 kaa gyanpith puraskaar, 2005 main sahitya academy kaa sarvocch sammaan sahitya academy kii mahattar sadsyta ullekhneey hai
 He was also awarded the Padma Bhushan, the country's third highest civilian honor in 2002
 aaj unki punyatithi par ham vaani prakaashan se chape unke upanyaas 've din' kaa ansh sahitya ajtak ke pathakon ke liye de rahe
 The characters in this novel, like the other narrative characters of Nirmal Verma, are the first to go
 agar duusare shabdon main kahen to manushya ke taur par ve kahin bhi kam nahin, balki badhkar hai, kisi bhi maanviya samaaj ke liye unki maujuudagi apekshit maani jaaegi
 Their suffering and their willingness and ability to recognize that suffering makes them valuable to our current intolerant society
 vah chaahe rayna ho, indi ho, franj ho yaa maaria, unamem se koi bhi apane dukh kaa hisaab har kisi se nahin maangata phirata
 So read this novel Anshve Din - Nirmal Varmavah was a bright day
 sardiyon main kabhi-kabhi achaanak aise din aa jate the, jab lagata, sardiyaan khatm ho rahi hai
 a warm bright day in the middle - an unlit, blank emerald-white and awe-inspiring copy of water
 vah sapane-sa lagata
 The birds of the trolley bus would have black queues, bake their wings in the sun
 ham inhen 'jhuthe basant' ke din kaha karte the
 They did not last long
 lekin jab ve aate the, log aturata se unhen nichod lete the- aakhri boond tak
 The streets of the city were filled with people
 ambenkat kii benchon par budhi auraten, apane-apane parambullator ke samay oonghati rahati
 Then suddenly i heard that voice
 awaz bhi nahin- mahaz ek sarsaraahat- barf or dhoop main dabi hui
 i would always catch this voice suddenly in solitude, or perhaps only when i was alone
 vah dariyaa kii ore se aati thi- kintu vah dariyaa kii hi awaz he, isamen mujhe sandeh tha
 It could be just air - sharp white and shapeless
 yaa sirf shahar kaa shor, jo puraane makaanon ke bich aate hi apana swar badal detaa tha
 a falling note between the houses - a brownish sound on the snow white on the 'keyboards' of trees, roofs, alleys
 main ab in puraane makaanon ke bich chal rahaa tha
 The name of the street was- vinohradi-angar Vines Square
 barason pehle yahan sharaab banaai jaati thi
 Franz lives — or lived — at the end of this square
 ab uskaa epartment khaali he
 But that day he was there and then someone
 nahin jaanata tha ki kach dinon baad vah praha main nahin hoga
 The chekhovi-guards used to come before his apartment and i always used to cross between them and cross the road
 sardiyon main sab pedo ke pattey jhar jate the, lekin chekhovi- gardens ke pine vrikshon kii suiyaan alag nahin hoti thim
 She bent down - like a chirping animal, which covers all its limbs to escape the cold; And then it seemed as if it was a blue island amidst the white sea of ice — wrapped in its own heat
 us din sara baag viraan tha
 The benches under the bare Topol trees were empty
 mujhe july-agast kii ve raaten yaad ho ain jab uniwarsity ke chaatr apni-apni ladakiyon ke saath baag ke andhere konon main baithe rahaa karte the
 In the middle, the black idol of the poet Chaikha used to stand silently, leaving the bottles of wine and beer on the idol's 'pedestal' - then in the late night the poor old women would enter the garden like the lovers and empty bottles of their skirts
 She used to disappear in the dark, stuck in long pockets
 yah pichhali garmiyon main tha
 
 
 And last summer that was my first summer in this city
 unheen dinon pehali baar main franj se mila tha
 There was a concert in prague-spring, in which i and T
 tii
 Had gone
 vahi cancert-haul ke galiyare main tii
 T
 ne meraa parichay franz se karaayaa tha
 That same evening he called me and T
 tii
 Was invited to his studio
 maine sochaa, yah painter he
 He also seemed
 uski badi olkohalic ankhen, lambaa gypsy-tip sweater or lambe maile naakun
 He put his one hand on the shoulder of the simple girl
 "yah meri ladki he," usne hamase kaha
 She started laughing
 vah maaria thi, yah hamane baad main janaa tha
 We met him many times later, only in Franz's studio
 vah studio nahin tha or na franz painter hi
 When we went to his room that evening, nothing but a big piano and sofa was visible
 kamare ke bich main hi ek taar lagi thi jis par uske mojey or undervier suukh rahe the
 On the wall in front of the piano was a portrait of Neinski
 
 
 petroshka ke vesh main
 
 
 Stravinsky was standing with him
 'kya kabhi tumne shaitan or ishwar ko ek saath dekha he ?' usne pipe sulagaate hue meri ore dekha
 Then pointed to that photo
 'main donon ko hi apane studio main rakhata hoon,' usne hanste hue kaha
 This was the beginning of our introduction
 sari shaam vah apane bare main hi bolta rahaa tha
 He liked to speak about himself - not like an egoist; Like a child who proudly shows his stamp-album to every man
 yah kehane kii bajaay ki dekho, yah arjantina kaa tikat he, yah greenland kaa vah sirf yah kahata tha ki dekho, yah meraa prem he, yah meri ghrinaa
 i can die on this
 main us par thukta bhi nahin
 He did not have much words
 vah german tha or angreji bahut kam aati thi
 Check less than that
 vastav main cinematography ke chaatro ko check seekhney kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati thi
 (franz received a scholarship from East German to study in a cinema school here
 ) jab kabhi bolte hue use angrezi kaa shabd nahin miltaa tha, vah uskaa german shabd maaria ko bataa detaa tha or maaria hamaare liye uskaa anuwaad check main kar detii thi
 Maria knew English, but she spoke in Czech
 franz ko check nahin aati thi
 Me and t
 tii
 German
 or kabhi-kabhi ham jaldi main bolte hue hadabada jate the ki kiske saath hamen kis bhashaa main bolnaa chahie
 It happened only on the first day
 baad main ham aadi ho gaye the

 195 / antimbala ko bachapan se hi bataaya gaya ki vah avaanchit hai or parivaar par ek boj hai
 She was disappointed with her fate and had assumed that she could never succeed
 antimbala ko vaakya kii rachana karne or shabdon ko likhane main sangharsh kaa saamana karnaa padaa, aisa nahin tha ki unamem kshamta nahin thi, lekin unhen yah bharosa dilaa diya gaya tha ki vah apane anya saathiyon kii tarah nahin ban sakati
 Such a story is angered, who was given this name because when she was born, her family members were very angry with her
 uskaa parivaar use parivaar par boj hone jaisaa mahasoos karaata tha
 The company said - do work in the office, we will take care of the house, know what happened then, in the lives of these two girls and many others, graduate Safina Hussain from 'london School of Economics', changed her life with passion and her liberator It has become
 vah is baat ko sunishchit karti hai ki vanchit or pichde varg kii prishthbhumi se aane vaali ladakiyon ko apni kismat ko nahin kosna paden or unhen skool pranali se judane kaa mauka mili
 Safina wants to ensure that girls like lastbala (it literally means last girl) can stand on their own and not fall prey to the prejudices of conservative society
 apane NGO (gaiyr sarkari sanghathan) ke madhyam se vah ladakiyon ko shikshit karti hai
 She and her team work with community-level volunteers 'team Girl Child', which identifies girls who do not go to school from door to door in remote rural areas and in their confidence to send their parents to school Tries to take apane nek kaam ke liye ek puraskaar grahan karne ke liye rashtriya rajdhani ain safeena ne ek intervyuu main bataaya ki antimbala ne jab kaksha main janaa shuru kiya to vah kuch alag-thalag rahati thi or shaikshik gatividhyon ke dauraan apane sahpaathiyon ke saath shaamil nahin hoti thi
 Our volunteers started connecting her with the classroom games and trying to find out why she keeps them all apart? Bhartiansafina, a bumper who passed out in Ashok Leyland for the 10th pass, said last year, now a year after getting support Can read stories from her textbook and her confidence has also increased significantly
 NGO shuru karne se pehle vah dakshin america, africa or asia main kareeb 10 saal tak vibhinn pariyojnaon se judi raheen
 He said, i have my heartfelt agenda
 
 That is, she returned to India for the education of girls
 shuru se hi bhartiya shiksha pranali main badlaav laane ko lekar mere andar nijee taur par majboot prerana thi, kyonki maine bhi apni manzil shiksha ke jariye hi pai thi
 Safina started her remarkable journey years ago and so far, with the help of 11,000 team girl volunteers, nearly 200,000 girls from Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have been enrolled in schools
 safeena kaa kahana he ki rosemara ke jivan main ye ladkiyaan kaaphi badi chunautiyon kaa saamana kar rahi hai
 He says that girls are usually seen as a burden and they are assured that girls should only be seen and not heard
 unhone naaraajana kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki jise avaanchit samajha jaataa ho, uski pidaa kii kalpana kiijie
 This is violence
 ladkiyaan khud ko kam samajhane lagati hai or yah samajhane lagati hai ki ladakon kii tarah unka parivaar unhen nahin chahta he
 Which started as a test project
 vah ab rajasthan ke 10 or madhyapradesh ke 3 jilon tak fail chukaa he
 However, this journey was not complete without a challenge
 safeena ne bataaya ki jab vah logon se apni betiyon kaa daakhila skulon main karaane ke liye kahatee to vah unke saamne hi daravaaje band kar lete
 People also spoke abusive words to him
 rajasthan kii bheeshan garmi main vah or unki team lagaataar ghar-ghar jaakar logon ko bharose main lete rahane kaa kaam karti rahi
 They held community meetings and won the trust of school officials

 An 11-year-old student of class three of Udaipur said that she was kept away from education due to gender discrimination
 uski maa use or uski bahan ko skool nahin bhejti thi or kahati thi ki ladakiyon ke liye padhai-likhaai bekaar he
 She told that the institution tried to talk to her mother continuously for six months, after which she agreed to send him to school
 safeena ne bataaya ki unhone paali jile main ek chota-sa skool pareekshan pariyojna shuru karne kaa faisla kiya
 She successfully conducted a pilot project with the help of the Rajasthan government and with the help of a local team, which helped her NGO to be formally registered in 2007

 Foundation Secretary Amitabh Bhushan told reporters that Mumbai is not a princely state of any individual, family or party but belongs to the whole country
 unhone kaha ki jab mumbai par aatanki hamalaa hota he yaa koi vipadaa aati he to thakare parivaar kii aawaaj sunai nahin detii he
 If Marathi people are committing suicide in Vidarbha, MNS or Shiv Sena do not take initiative for their welfare
 dekhen mumbai main kaise hua uttar bharatiyon par julmfoundation ke sanyojak bhavesh nandan jha ne kaha ki manase or shivasena kaa jor keval garib logon par chalata he jinke saath marpet or gundgardee kar ve bahaduree samajhate he
 Significantly, in Mumbai, auto rickshaw drivers were beaten up by MNS workers on Wednesday

 bharat ne kar chori or karon se judi jaalsaji kaa fark mitaane ke liye dabaav banane kaa faisla kiya he
 Significantly, the difference between tax evasion and tax fraud has helped Indian citizens to hide their income abroad
 kar chori or karon se judi jaalsaji kaa fark mitaane kii kavayad videshon main jamaa dhan waapas lene ke makasad se kii ja rahi he
 Sources said that many countries have refused to give information on the grounds that tax evasion is not a crime as per the law of their country but they will cooperate if it involves forgery related to taxes
 beete saptaah ke ant main paris main yojit ji-20 deshon kii baithak main is bindu par jor-shor se charchaa kii gayi
 The G20 countries' meeting was attended by finance ministers and central bank heads
 ‘kar chori’ or ‘karon se judi jaalsaji’ kii alag-alag paribhaasha hone se paidaa hone vaali samasyaon kaa zikr karte hue vitt mantri pranav mukherjee ne kaha ki donon main talmail kii jarurat he taaki sambandhit deshon se bina kisi baadha ke suchanaaen hasil kii ja sake
 At the G20 Ministers' meeting, Mukherjee said, "some countries differentiate between tax fraud and tax evasion
" manyata ke is antar se sampatti ko jaanboojhkar chupaane main madad milti he taaki kar chori kii ja sake
 This is something that is considered a crime all over the world and hinders the effective exchange of information
 ’mukherjee ne kaha, ‘videshon main dhan jamaa karke rakhane vaale kar choron kaa pataa lagane ke sarkari mulajimon ke prayaas main madad karne ke liye hamen deshon ko yah fark mitaane ko protsaahit karnaa chahie
 The Finance Minister said that the 78 countries with which India entered into a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) are reviewing it

 'DTAA will help in seeking banking information about the culprits
 karnataka kii congress-jedies gathbandhan sarkaar khatre main dikhaai de rahi he
 So far 13 mlas of the coalition government have resigned
 saath hi or bhi vidhayak istipha de sakate hai
 However, the resignations have not yet been accepted
 kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki vidhayakon ke istife ke kaaran karnataka vidhansabha ke sameekaran puri tarah badal sakate hai
 The Congress has alleged that the BJP is responsible for this situation
 karnataka kii jedies-congress sarkaar girane ke puure asaar hai
 However, the formation of Kumaraswamy government in Karnataka was nothing short of a miracle
 bhartiya janata party vidhansabha main sabase padi party he
 While Congress is at number two, Kumaraswamy's 'JDS' is the party at number three
 phir bhi congress ne tisare number kii party ko mukhyamantri pad de diya or us sarkaar main shaamil ho gai
 Political crisis over Karnataka: With the formation of this government, predictions of its fall were being made
 ab congress-jedies ke 13 vidhayakon ne istipha de diya he
 With this, the government of Kumaraswamy seems certain to fall
 karnataka kaa sankat siyaasi he
 bjp's ambition is not only responsible for it, but some leaders of Congress party are equally responsible
 siddharmaiya ke mukhyamantri rahete hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress pichad gai
 Despite this, the Congress retained its strength
 bhartiya janata party 105 siten jiti or congress 78 va jedies ne 37 siten jiti thi
 Nevertheless, the congress-jds formed a coalition government
 bahumat kaa aankada 113 hone ke kaaran yah sarkaar vyavasthit chal sakati thi
 But the biggest question was, did Siddaramaiah want to let this government run? This 13-month-old government proved unfortunate from day one
 kumaraswami mukhyamantri hai tab bhi unke back seat par siddharmaiya baithe the
 Hence running the government proved difficult for Kumaraswamy
 dekha jaae to aam sabhaaon ke jariye ye dukh unhone kai baar vyakt kiya
 Will the BJP government be formed in three states? Although the Congress supported the JDS, its leaders were trying to be the architects of the government
 sach kahen to loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle sarkaar giraayi ja sakati thi par bhaajapa ne is kaary ko aage dhakel diya
 But now the process of its completion has started
 kuch dinon pehle hi bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne hyderabad main kaha tha ki, 'dakshin ke teen rajyon main bhaajapa kii sarkaar aegi
 These include Kerala, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh
 'usamen karnataka kaa naam jodne main dikkat nahin thi kyonki yahaan jaisaa nishchit tha vaisaa hi hota dikh rahaa he
 The government of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan can also come in trouble
 mana ja rahaa he ki karnataka jaisi paristhiti un rajyon main bhi paidaa ho sakati hai
 Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said on Saturday that some Congress mlas are in contact with us but we will not sabotage and form the government
 todphod karke sarkaar banani he ki nahin is par rashtriya niti honi chahie
 Congress has an absolute majority in Chhattisgarh
 vahiin rajasthan, madhya pradesh main aisi paristhiti he kii agar phoonk maari to unki sarkaar gir jaaegi
 It is true that the mlas are ready to change
 goa kii bhaajapa sarkaar alpamat main thi aakhirkaar wo ab sthir ho gai he
 Congress mlas resigned directly
 vahiin bhaajapa main aakar mantri ban gaye parantu panaji kaa vidhansabha upachunaav bhaajapa haar gai
 Manohar Parrikar used to win from here
 aisa lag rahaa he ki desh main vipaksh kii sarkarein ab zyada nahin tikengi or bhaajapa kaa ecchhatra rajya puure desh main hone vaala he

 Two weeks ago, 23-year-old Soumya Iyer from Pune was tempted to play Pokémon Go
 usne apni makvami ko bhi is mobile game ko lekar apni deewangi ke bare main bataa diya
 a few days later his 49-year-old mummy Manisha Iyer downloaded this app
 ve kahati hai, ''maine sirf isliye ise khelnaa shuru kiya tha taaki main iske prati bad rahi deewangi ke bare main jaan sakuun
 Later i wanted to defeat and tease Soumya by getting more and better Pokémon
 '' maine jab saumya se baat kii to unhone bataaya ki unki mummy unke bhai se kah rahi thim ki jab ve dopaher main so rahi hon to vah pokamon jamaa karata rahe
 In 2003, the Japanese animation show Pokémon reached out to those Indian kids watching TV who watched Cartoon Network with attention for half an hour every day
 is sho main 10 varsh kaa upekshit baccha tha, jo pocket masters ko ikattha karne or unhen prashikshit karne ke liye safar par jaataa he
 There he becomes a close friendship with other trainers and his Pokémon

 One such brand was frito-lay (a division of pepsico owned by Hindustan Unilever), which kept Pokémon hidden in every pack of Cheetos and Uncle Chips
 jaahir he, isse bacchon kii makhmiyon ko bahut gussa aata tha, kyonki unhen har roj kiraane kii dukaan par inhen kharidne ke liye janaa padataa tha
 Later its popularity gradually waned, but by then it had generated a whole generation of fans, who are now over 20 years old
 pokamon ko lekar jab bharat main dobaaraa deewangi paidaa ho gai to kisi ke liye yah aashcharya kii baat nahin thi
 This time around, this crazy location-based AR (augmented Reality) mobile game has come in the form of 'pokemon Go'

 According to data available on information technology company Similweb, India ranks fourth in terms of highest number of apks downloaded
 game launch hone ke kuch hi samay baad nintando ke share aasmaan chune lage or 1983 main apni shuruyaat ke baad se ye sabase upar the
 But the boom lasted only a few days and its shares fell again when investors came to know that Nintendo was not the creator of the game (they announced that they had the game ready to go with the help of Niantic
 The company The Pokémon Company has a 32 percent stake)
 jab aap pokamon go kii shuruaati lokapriyata dekhenge to ye aankade kahin se bhi atiranjit nahin lagenge
 The simplicity of the award-based game to some extent confirms its tremendous popularity
 is game ko samajhane ke liye jaruri nahin he ki aap pokamon siries se parichit hon
 This is the first time the country has collectively seen AR gaming on such a large scale
 is game ne 'screen kii aadi' puri peedi ko apane agosh main le liya he
 If you hear that playing a game benefits your health, it is difficult to believe it once
 aapako kuch log apni bikon or kaaron par aaraam se sawari karte hue kam se kam samay main zyada se zyada pokamon jutate hue dikh jaaenge
 Its features include Pokéstops and Pokémon Gyms
 pokestops par khilaadi pokaboles or peyavastuon sareekhee apni nijee chijen ikattha karte hai, jabaki pokamon jims ve jagahen hai jahaan alag-alag tiimon ke khilaadi experions points hasil karne ke liye gang-waar ke andaaj main muqabla karte hai or jims ko fatah karne main apni tiimon kii madad karte hai
 Pokéstops and gyms are typically located in the Places of Interest (which were drawn by players in the released Ingress of the pre-niantic AR, and in Pokémon Go, which was redesigned)
 vahaan se ye inhen hairaan-pareshaan tamashbinon yaa darshakon tak le jate hai jo mandiron or kabristaanon main har ghante jamaa ho rahi khiladinnon kii bheed ko dekh rahe hai
 But its accessibility is also non-existent as areas in Tier-1 cities like Mumbai and Delhi have Pokestops and Gyms every 500 meters, while Indore is struggling with a total of three gyms
 mumbai main rahane vaali 24 varshiya niha patil bataati hai ki kis tarah is khel ne unhen apane ilaake kii chaanbin karne main madad kii
 She says, "I found a Japanese restaurant on my first Pokéwalk and later found that i have a musical fountain in my area
" '' yah khel aapako nayaa najariya to de hi saktaa he, iske alaava isane khiladinnon ko ek-duusare ke saath ghulne-milane kaa bhi mauka diya he
 It is now common to see players running around or waiting for their phone to vibrate (hinting that the Pokémon has been found) while pausing on Pokéstops and smirking at their fellow players
 mumbai main rahane vaale 27 saal ke lekhak nahim abdulla vakya bataate hai, ''pokamon kii hanting karte-karte bich raste barish main funs jane par main ek restaraan main thahar gaya
 As a result, after talking about Pokémon Go, i became friends with some people sitting at the side table
 ''kaarobaariyon ko is junun main chhipi sambhaavnaaon ko pahchaanane main der nahin lagi
 Restaurants and stores in the US took full advantage of the Lure module to attract customers
 (lyur modul naam kii yah divaais pokamon kii fouj ko ek pokestop main aane ke liye lubhaati he or phir apane najadik maujuud harek khilaadi ko kuchhek pokecoins ke badale main 30 minute yaa usase zyada vakt ke liye unhen pakadaaey kaa mauka detii he)
 The Bangalore-based start-up Bhukkad produced maps of all the Pokestops and gyms in its area, as well as a Facebook event, in which players were invited to visit their hungry pokécorner
 bhukkad ke sansthaapak 26 varshiya anuj garg ne bataaya, ''hamane bhukkad ke najadik ek pokestop par chah ghanton ke liye lyur modul creat kiya
 Each Pokémon captured is given a discount
 harek kharid par unhen ek team ko vot karne ke liye kaha gaya
 The team that received the most votes was also given discounts for the rest of the week
 '' is marketing ranneeti kaa acha-khaasaa phayda hua
 Bhukkad got 10 times the amount he had invested in this exercise
 magar pokamon go kii neeli-hari duniya main sab kuch acha hi acha nahin he
 Since the Indian players have downloaded unofficial files, there is a lot of pressure on the existing servers
 natijatan ap kuch ghanton main krash kar jaati he
 Some players have criticized that there is no complication in this game
 udhar, adhikariyon ko shikaayat he ki unhen khilaadi kii nijee sampattiyon main ghusane, pratibandhit ilaakon main jane, bich raat main 'matargashti' karne or yahaan tak ki laaparvaahee se gaadi chalaane sareekhee dikkaton se jujhna pad rahaa he
 But when they cannot overcome them, they sometimes join them
 ahmedabad main rahane vaale web develper 24 varshiya meet bhatta haal hi kaa ek kissa bataate hai
 He was confronted with a batch of policemen who ran in disgrace
 unhone maan liya ki jarur kahin na kahin koi afat aa padi he
 He continues with a laugh, "he returned saying that" we couldn't catch a single one "—of course, they were trying to catch Pokémon!" It's hard to say that this passion lasts much longer Whether it will last or not, but there are signs of stagnation in activities till it is officially launched in India
 yah tehraav pataa nahin kitna lanbaa hoga, kyonki bharat main iske launch hone kii taarikh kaa bhi abhi elaan nahin hua he
 On July 22, there was an uproar on Twitter and Facebook, when players from Chennai, Kolkata and Bangalore were very much shocked and puzzled as to where all the things in the game had disappeared
 yahi haalat aaj tak kaayam he, jisase zyaadaatar logon kaa maananaa he ki jio-block yani ilaakai pabandi laga di gai he
 The same was done in Japan before the game was officially released
 kai logon ko shaq he ki agar isaki relies kii taarikh zyada hi lambii tali to is khel ko lekar jo junun paidaa hua he, vah tikega bhi yaa nahin
 But it cannot be denied that Pokémon Go has made a tremendous impact in India and on India
 yah badha-chadhaakar pesh kii gai hakeekat or gaming ke ek nae daur kaa aagaaj he
 If played wisely, it can have many good effects as well
 iske bare main yahi baat kisi na kisi rup main bahut aashajanak khyaal kii tarah jaan padati he

 Dr
 Naresh Raj, who performed the postmortem of Hemraj, had said that according to his report Hemraj had made physical relations before the murder

 On the other hand, Dr Sunil Dohre, who did the Aarushi treatment, told the trial court that the presence of white discharge in Aarushi's vaginal cavity indicated signs of sexual harassment
 court ne sawaal kiya ki dohare kii postmortem report or die gaye teen bayanon main kahin bhi intercorse kaa zikr nahin kiya gaya tha

 is report ke aadhaar par bhi sexual intercorse kii theory par andeh hota he
 At the same time, the reason for the swelling in the private part of Hemraj was told that his body lay in the sun for 24 hours

 pradhanmantri nuri al maliki pehali baar videshi sainikon kii maujuudagi se mukt raashtra ke netaa ke rup main ravivaar ko america ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye
 The withdrawal of US troops is in the final stages
 apni do divasiy america yatra ke dauraan maliki raashtrapati baraak obama se vyapak muddon par charchaa karenge
 Nearly eight years ago, US troops, led by US forces to overthrow Saddam Hussein, are withdrawing completely from Iraq, and the process is less than a month away
 maliki ke media salaahkaar ali musavi ne bataaya ki yah pehali baar hoga ki maliki ek aise iraqi raashtra ke mukhiya ke rup main ja rahe hai, jab desh main america sainik nahin honge
 Maliki is accompanied by Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari, Acting Defense Minister Saadun Al Dulaimani, Transport Minister Kharullah Hasan Babakir, Trade Minister Hadi Al Ameiri and National Security Advisor Phalah Al Fayad
 loksabhaa chunaav kii siyaasi jang jeetne ke liye raajnneetik partiyon ke netaa lagaataar bayaanbaji kar rahe hai or ek duusare par hamalaa bol rahe hai
 The speech of some leaders is also slipping due to this rude rhetoric
 ab madhya pradesh bijepi ke adhyaksh rakesh singh ko hi dekh lijie
 While addressing a public meeting, he spoke something that is causing him criticism
 darasal bijepi netaa rakesh singh congress or madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh par hamalaa bol rahe the or bhagava kaa bakhaan kar rahe the, lekin unki jubaan phisal gai or arth kaa anarth ho gaya
 Addressing a public meeting, he said, 'saffron is never terrorism, saffron is never a terrorist, terrorist is a symbol of sacrifice, penance and sacrifice
 ’unhone aage kaha ki jab chunaav kaa samay aata he, tab congress ke netaa or digvijay singh jagah-jagah bhagava kii sharan main ghutane tekte najar aate hai
 This statement of Rakesh Singh has come to light when the BJP has given Lok Sabha election ticket from Bhopal to the accused of the Malegaon bomb blast, Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur
 bijepi ne sadhvi pragna ko congress ke diggaj netaa digvij singh ke khilaaf maidan main utaara he
 With this, the Congress is continuously putting the BJP in the dock
 # watchmadhya Pradesh BJP President Rakesh Singh says, "bhagvaa kabhi aatankwad nahi hota, bhagva dhaaran karne wala kabhi aatankwadi nahi hota, aatankwad to pyaar, tapasya aur balidaan ka prateek hota hai

 unhone rahul kaha tha, 'aapako (rahul gandhi) ye hi pataa nahin lagata he ki bolnaa kya he, manch ke upar se aap narendra modi ko chor bol rahe hai, chaukeedaar chor he
 'BJP leader said,' Brother, your mother has been vowed, you have been vowed, your GJ has been vowed
 puraa tabbar (parivaar) hi jamaanti he, bhai tu koun hota he jaj kii tarah chor bolne vaala he
 'during this, Satpal Singh Satti said,' a person wrote on Facebook that i cannot speak from the platform

 Senior leaders like Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Arun Shourie were sidelined in the party

 shatrughna sinha (shatrughan Sinha) nekaha ki party ne apane vaade puure nahin kiye
 a big decision like demonetisation was taken without any consultation
 jisaki vajah se hajaaron log barbaad ho gaye
 He called demonetisation as the biggest scam
 sinha ne kaha ki bijepi main logon kii koi kadra nahin he
 i talked about farmers and youth, but nobody paid any attention to it

 The talk of senior economists like Manmohan Singh was not given due consideration
 virodhiyon ko dushman samajha gaya
 During this, he also praised RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav and said that on his advice, he joined Congress

 Congress's performance in Haryana: People vote on local issues
 Most of the people of Haryana live in the areas of West Delhi and Outer Delhi
 aise main mana ja rahaa he jis tarah se haryana main congress kaa pradarshan sudhara he to kya yah dilli ke liye khatra he
 It is believed that the vote bank of the Aam Aadmi Party is the same as the Congress once used to be
 aise main agar maan len ki dilli main bhi congress kii sthiti behatar hoti he to kya aam aadmi party ko iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna padegaa yaa phir trikoniya mukaable main bijepi ko phayda ho saktaa he
 Putting all these speculations to a halt, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said in his statement, 'the people of Delhi are sensible, Haryana's election will not have any effect on it
 'dilli main siyaasi maahauladilli main sabhi partiyon ne chunaav kii taiyaari shuru kar di he lekin guuruuvaar ko aehryana or maharashtra vidhansabhachunaav nateezon ke baad dilli main siyaasi maahaul or bhi garmane vaala he
 The wave of BJP which was seen after the Lok Sabha election results in May, weakened in Maharashtra and Haryana
 vipakshi partiyon ko jeet beshak na mili ho lekin pradarshan main aae sudhaar ne virodhiyon kii ummid jarur jagaa di he
 On the other hand, the upcoming Delhi elections will not be easy for BJP leaders too, this sign is clearly visible in the results of the assembly elections on Thursday
 bijepi shaayad is baat ko pehle hi bhaanp chuki he, isliye rigelt aane se ek din pehle hi anadhikrut coloniyon ko tohfa dene kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 The wave of BJP was seen in the Lok Sabha elections, the impact of Delhi's politics, so in the May Lok Sabha elections where the BJP won ten seats in Haryana, in Delhi too the party won seven seats out of seven
 bijepi ko kul vot kaa 58% haryana main hasil hua to dilli main kul vot kaa 56% party ko mila tha
 But within 5 months, bjp's 22 per cent vote slipped to 36
 4 fisadi par pahunch gaya he
 Clearly, people voted on local issues
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki ab dilli main bhi aam aadmi party or congress bijepi ke liye mushkilen paidaa kar sakati he
 Delhi KCM Arvind Kejriwal has been focusing on local issues such as electricity, DTC, environment, dengue one after the other in the Lok Sabha elections
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Narendra Modi) had 'discussion on examination' with the children in view of the CBSE Board Exams 2019
 piem narendra modi ne chaatro ko safalataa ke tips die the or ab deshbhakti se labarej filmein banane vaale bollywood ke khilaadi kumaar akshay kumaar (akshay Kuamr) ne bhi bacchon ko pariksha se jude sutara die hai
 Akshay Kumar has given advice to students as well as parents
 khaas yah ki sibiesai board parikshaon ke maddenjar akshay kumaar (akshay Kumar) ne piem narendra modi (PM Narendra Modi) kaa video share kiya tha or uske saath ye coment likhaa tha
 But now Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala has also shared this tweet
 Lovely https: / / t
 co / 2wibge5oiu Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar tweeted: 'the thing that i find myself connected to
 
 
 main kabhi bhi padhai main acha nahin tha lekin bhagwaan kii krupa, mata-pita kii duaon or mehnat kii vajah se mujhe lagata he, maine jo bhi thodaa bahut kiya he, acha kiya he
 Now that the exams have come, i would like to say to the students and parents that there is much more to life than just exams
 ' is tarah akshay kumaar ne sibiesai board exam (CBSE Board Exams) main baithne ja rahe chaatro ko bada sabak diya he
 Akshay Kumar has also shared the video of Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Narendra Modi) with this tweet, in which PM Modi gave the students tips to succeed in the exam
 vaise bhi akshay kumaar lambey samay se sandeshparak filmein banane main yakeen kar rahe hai
 Then whether it is 'toilet: a love story', 'padman' or 'gold'
 akshay kumaar kii filmon main deshbhakti or desh se judi baaten kaaphi gahare dhang se shaamil hoti hai
 Narendra Modi's coronation was not as threatened by Advani's displeasure as the stern stand of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 nitish ne pehle bhi bijepi ko saaf kiya tha ki unki party jediu ko secular cheharaa hi sweekaar hoga
 JDU also broke the alliance with the BJP in Bihar recently, citing this reason
 donon taraf se iske baad tir chalane lage
 Till date, reporter Sujit Kumar Jhan's special conversation with Nitish Kumar and known about his politics
 
 
 sawalhapane 17 saalon kaa gathbandhan tod diya
 People are saying that this decision was taken in haste and pressure
 javabzham logon ne jaldbaaji main faisla nahin liya he
 In view of the circumstances, we had to take our decision as a political party
 ham logon ke faisle ko samajhane ke liye is prishthbhumi ko ko yaad karnaa jaruri he ki hamaara bijepi ke saath talmail kyon hua, kin halaaton main hua
 This was needed to prevent the splitting of anti-vote votes in Bihar
 1995 main 27 fisadi mat paakar rajya main sarkaar bani
 The rest of the votes were scattered
 inhen ekajute karne ke liye ek ranneetik samaj hui hamaari bijepi ke saath
 NDA was formed in 1999
 centre sarkaar main ham ek saal pahel 1998 main shaamil ho gaye the
 But this happened when we got an assurance that the BJP would not proceed on contentious issues
 centre main atal ke netritv main jo sarkaar chali, unke kaam kaa tarika or gathbandhan kaa vistaar jis dhang or kaaryastylee se hua, use dekhie
 Stayed away from controversies
 sabko saath lekar chalane kii koshish hui
 This was the basis of our alliance
 sawalabijepi kah rahi he ki uske gathbandhan kaa abhi bhi yahi aadhaar he
 
 
 Answer: No, now we see the situation of who can say the disputed issues, a new era has come
 jiske pravaah main na siddhant he na kaarykram
 We had given a puzzle for a year about what should happen
 ye gathbandhan kaa daur he, koi mugalate main na rahe ki akele bahumat paa legaa
 This country is full of diversities
 hamane jab dekha ki logon ko apni takat ke bare main bhram ho gaya he or ise lekar wo ek tarah se bulldos kar rahe hai
 So decided
 bihar main tab tak thik thaak chalaa jab tab gathbandhan kaa aadhaar sahi salaamat tha
 When external factors started coming in it, it became difficult
 yahaan ke log shuru se thik raste par the
 But later there was a slow pressure in his party, he also came
 isliye aapane dekha ki 19 june ko jab vidhansabha main vishwaas mat par charchaa hui to jo naare lage
 
 
 They justify our stand
 hamane koi jaldbaaji nahin kii, puri tarah soch samajhakar faisla liya gaya
 If we do not take this step, it would be to deceive ourselves
 sawalabijepi baar baar kah rahi he ki abhi to piem ke candidet kaa elaan hi nahin hua, jo faisle hue ve sanghathan ke andruni maamle hai
 In such a situation why JDU is in a panic? Answer: We are sad that the alliance which was here, leaving behind the issues on which you started imposing other things
 yahaan jo maryaada bani he, uskaa ullaghann shuru hua
 People here openly started making statements
 yahaan gathbandhan kii jo buniyadi avdharana thi, uske thik pratikul tha yah sab
 When we praised the work of Bihar, people felt that they were also complaining
 ye kaam to jab ham saath the, tabhi kiya tha na, to wo aalochana kaise lagane laga
 Praised Atal's work, it still happened
 jab aapas main baat itani bighad jaae, to saath mumkin nahin
 Question: PM told you secular
 vishwaas mat par congress saath ai
 Will this party be your new partner? Answer: It is not right
 vidhansabha main vishwaas mat ke paksh main sipiai ne bhi samarthan kiya
 He first declared that on the basis of the issues that have broken down, we will support the government's trust vote
 baad main congress ke samarthan kaa bhi elaan hua
 He himself decided
 lekin unhone saport kiya, to hamane dhanyavad kiya
 Of the six independent mlas who supported, five already supported the NDA
 hamane sabko dhanyavad kiya
 At the current date nobody noticed, about the alliance or any cooperation
 jab aisa kiya hi nahin to kya uttar ho
 Question: In today's politics, there are only two streams, one has to be caught? Answer: See, the present phase is the era of coalition
 koi bhram main na rahe ki akele kii sarkaar ban sakati he
 272 are needed to form a government, which will come after winning
 saath ladane vaale yaa nahin bhi ladakar baad main saath dene waalon ke jariye 272 kii sankhya puri hogi, tab sarkaar banegi, log bekaar kaa bhram paale hai
 In 2004, you remember, bjp's Venkaiah Naidu used to say that he would win 350 on his own, but still keep his colleagues together
 lagata tha ki itnaa kitna survey karwaae hai
 Seemed strange
 abhi bhi survey ho rahe hai kai
 But they are trustworthy
 sab piaar eksrasij he, prachaar tantra he
 Let's not see how social media is
 ek hi aadmi kaa kitna acount he ki ata pataa tak nahin
 Question: It is also being said that Nitish himself wants to become PM, that's why he got separated in due course of time
 
 
 javabzham anek baar kah chuke hai ki meri piem pad kii koi khwaahish nahin he
 Every day these things arise and have to say, we never thought about it
 ham chaahate hai ki puure desh kaa vikaas ho, raajnneeti samaveshi ho
 Plan according to everyone's needs
 vikaas kii ranneeti main gunatmak parivartan paradime shift hona chahie
 If the backward states are developed, then the development of the country will be rapid
 aaj isamen utaar-chadhaav he kyonki chand rajyon ke vikaas par desh kaa vikaas nirbhar he
 Development does not just mean the emergence of corporate houses, development means the rise of the lower rung Haswal: So who do you think is likely to form a government in 2014? Answer: The wind that is being tied to water is not going to happen
 main aapako spsht bataa duun
 They are making mistakes in understanding the country, they are not going to do anything by surveying the air, using social media, using media
 ye sabko maaloom he
 May be the effect in some urban areas
 magar ye desh vividhtaon se bharaa he
 They do not know the power of the poor
 baari chook kar rahe hai sab

 Attacking the central government, Nitish said that rising inflation and corruption have proved that good days are not coming and breathtaking promises were made only to garner votes
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki narendra modi ke satta main aane se kareeb chaar lakh rupee kii naukari kaa sapana dikhaakar soshal media ke jariye yuvaaon kii ankhon main dhul jhonka gaya
 Clever people from outside went to the villages and small towns of Bihar and sold this dream and they disappeared as soon as the voting was over

 Expressing disappointment over the release of jamaat-ud-dawa chief Hafiz Mohammed Sayeed by Pakistan's Supreme Court, India on Friday said it had provided 'sufficient evidence' to Pakistan against the 'mastermind' of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai that would lead to its conviction
 Was enough for videsh mantri es em krishna ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ‘swaabhaavik taur par ham is baat se niraash hai ki pakistan ke ucchtam nyaayalay ne hafiz mohammad said kii rihaai ke khilaaf sangheey or punjab sarkaar kii apil ko khaarij kar diya
 We still consider Saeed to be the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks
 ’krishna ne kaha ‘pakistan ke ucchtam nyaayalay ne apane paas maujuud sabooton ke aadhaar par hi nishkarsh die hai
 We have given sufficient evidence
 hamaare kanoonee visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki hamaari ore se muhaiyaa karaae gaye saboot said par mukadmaa chalaane or sajaa dilaane ke liye kaaphi the
 He said that Saeed had openly proclaimed jihad against India and its leadership organizations lashkar-e-tayyaba and jamaat-ud-dawa were described as terrorist organizations by the UN Security Council
 videsh mantri krishna ne kaha ‘pakistan ne hamen bharosa dilaayaa he ki ve apni jameen kaa istemaal bharat ke khilaaf aatankwaad failaane main nahin hone denge
 He said that India wants to move forward on this trust of Pakistan

 The Indian team gained a lead of 439 runs by dismissing Sri Lanka for 183 runs in the first innings and also forced Sri Lanka to play follow-on
 srilanka ke khilaaf 439 ranon kii badhat team india kii kisi bhi team ke khilaaf teesri sabase zyada ranon kii badhat he
 India had earlier scored a 492-run lead against Bangladesh in Dhaka in 2007, while in the year 2011, they had a lead of 478 runs in the Kolkata Test against the West Indies
 srilanka ke khilaaf ab bharat ne apane test cricket ke itihaas main teesri sabase badi badhat hasil kii he
 India broke pak's record against Sri Lanka, India's 439 run lead against Sri Lanka is the highest run lead of any team
 srilanka kii team ke khilaaf aaj tak kisi bhi team ne itane ranon kii badhat hasil nahin kii thi
 Before India, Pakistan had the record of taking the lead for the most runs against Sri Lanka
 pakistan ne saal 2000 main galle test main srilanka ke khilaaf 419 ranon kii badhat hasil kii thi
 But now India has beaten Pakistan and made this record in its name
 pehali pari main 183 ran par bhi dher hui thi srilankaapako bataa den ki bharat ne apni pehali pari main 9 wicket ke nuksaan par 622 ran banaae the
 In response, Sri Lanka's entire team was reduced to 183 runs

 ) Before the start of the 2015 World Cup, if someone asks how much hopes are there for India's win against Australia in this tournament, most of the knowledgeable and fans give very low marks to Team India
 lekin lig main team india ke pradarshan se yakeenan duniya bhar ke jaankaron or phans kii raay badali he
 Crazy and passionate fans of India are raising the slogan of Team India
 australia kii pakistan ke khilaaf jeet ke baad jaise hi semifinal kii tasviir saaf hui yah naaraa or tej hone laga he
 At any cricket ground in India, the fans asked the group who would win the World Cup, then the same voices would come - India
 
 
 india
 
 
 
 lekin kai jaankaar maanate hai ki australian zamin par australia kaa palada thodaa baari he
 He believes that the real challenge of Team India will be in the semi-finals against Australia
 purv test cricketer vijay daahiya kehete hai ki agar bharat ko australia ke khilaaf match khelnaa he to kisi ek khilaadi ko badi pari khelni hogi
 So far, four batsmen of Team India have played five century innings in league matches and quarter finals
 bharat kii ore se khilaadiyon ne paanch shatak or saat ardhshtak lagaae hai
 After the win against Bangladesh, former captain Sunil Gavaskar said that the good thing is that all the players are scoring at different times
 australia ke kilaaf ho saktaa he loar order ballebaazon ko bhi acha yogadan dene kii zarurat pade
 Therefore, against Team Bangladesh, especially Ravindra Jadeja, playing fast innings and not getting out, getting Team India to cross the boundary line of 300 is a good sign for the team management
 jadeja ko saat match kii chaar pariyon main ballebaazi kaa mauqe mili jinamein unhonen kul 41 ran banaae hai, lekin bangladesh ke khilaaf unki naabad 23 ranon kii pari se unka aatmavishvaas jarur lautaa hoga, jisase team raahat mahasoos kar sakati he
 After a century against Pakistan, the expectation of a big score from Virat Kohli remains constant
 shaayad vah bade maukey ke intjaar main hai
 He has not been able to score big since Ajinkya Rahane's 79-run knock against South Africa
 zaahir he team india kii batting line ap main top order ke sabhi ballebaazon se badi ummid rahegi hi
 Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja have played the role of match winner several times
 lekin is baar worldcup main ab tak sattar main sattar wicket lekar gendbaaj team india kii jeet main turup kaa ikkaa bane hue hai
 So far Mohammad Shami (17 / 226), Umesh Yadav (14 / 249), R
 aswin (12 / 288), mohit sharma (11 / 239), ravindra jadeja (9 / 301), bhubaneshwar kumaar (1 / 19) or suresh raina (1 / 64) kii gendbaazi ke sahare team india ne dhamal machaaya hua he
 Surprisingly, despite the rules in favor of batsmen, Ravindra Jadeja (economy - 5
 31) ko chhodkar sabaki iconmi 5 se neeche he
 The Australian team will neither mistake this bowling nor batting lightly
 unhen yah bhi andaaza he ki kareeb maheene bhar ke vakt main team india apane puraane form main he or dephending champion kii tarah khel rahi he
 While the Australian team suffered a defeat at the hands of the hosts in New Zealand and they were almost overcome by the Pakistan bowlers
 chaar baar kii champion australia apane aakhri match se isliye behad khush nahin hogi, kyonki isse unamem daraar kaa ishaara bhi mila he
 Team India's bravehearts will definitely take full advantage of it
 26 march ko sidney main imtihaan se pehle team india ko acha vakt mila he, australia ko saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat he
 The Indian team, which went on a tour of South Africa, is not doing very well and Indian cricket fans are also disappointed by this
 lekin ek cricket fain is baat se itnaa pareshaan hua ki usne khud ko aag hi laga lee

 Babulal has also told the police that he set himself on fire when Kohli was dismissed

 Let us tell you that in the first innings of the first Test against South Africa, Virat Kohli was dismissed by scoring only five runs

 Virat Kohli has been seen struggling on the balls swinging out of the stumps

 This weakness was also revealed in the series against Australia last year

 Ramachandra Guha resigned from the BCCI Administrator's Committee amid controversy over the issue of the current coach and captain in Team India
 ram chandra guha ko supreme court kii dwaara gathit panel main ahm jagah di gai thi
 Now many more aspects are being added in this case, according to the news, according to Guha some players are being given more importance in the team, that is why despite the good performance, Anil Kumble's contract has not increased
 sioe ke chairman vinod raay ko likhe apane istife main ramchandra guha ne saaf kaha ki agar niyamon ke hisaab se chalem to parformens ke aadhaar par anil kumble kaa turm badhaayaa janaa chahie
 The team has given good results in the past, even though the players get credit for it, but the coach also deserves this success
 guha ne bina kisi kaa naam liye kaha kibhartiya cricket main superstar culturalagataar bad rahaa he
 Due to which Kumble's methods were not considered right
 guha ke khat ke anusaar, team kaa coach koun ho, iskaa faisla karne kaa adhikaar khilaadiyon ke paas nahin hona chahie
 This right should remain with the BCCI officials
 khatm ho 'superstar' cultureguha ne kaha ki agar bisisiai lagaataar bad rahe superstar culture ko khatm nahin karata he
 So in the coming time, they may have to bear the brunt of it

 Recent research by Kotlia has revealed that debris has been coming into Naini Lake rapidly for the last 50-60 years

 According to him, soil and stones will be removed from the lowest level of the lake again in summer
 jhil ko dekh rahe sinchai vibhaag ke adhishasi abhiyantaa harish chandra singh or jal santhaan ke adhishasi abhiyantaa sunil tiwari ke anusaar, 2016 se pehle jhil se shahar ko pratidin 16 se 20 ghante pani kii supplai hoti thi, jo kareeb 16 emeldi thi, lekin 2015-16 main barish, barfbaari main kami ai or jhil kaa aakaar badal gaya
 The main reason for this is the lack of water in the lake and the drying up of the sources that fill the lake, as well as the decrease in ground water from the ground water in Nainital

 After this, in the year 2009, 2011, the lake reached its lowest water level in May and in 20013, 2014, in April itself it reached such a point that the level of the lake reached zero
 saal 2016 main jhil farvari maheene main hi apane nunatam jalastr par pahunch gai

 According to those who studied the lake, in the last fifty years, the water level of the lake was around 7 feet in the year 1993 and 2001 only, this year the minimum water level of the lake has been seen since the month of February at least which is That has now reduced to an alarming extent

 According to scientists studying the lake, the shrinking rate of this lake in the month of June was ten centimeters per day in the year 2012, so till date this shrinking rate reached 19 centimeters in March 2016 itself

 According to this gauge, the water level of the lake should normally be five feet in February

 MK Stalin said that his party would protest in all districts of the state at 10 am on 20 September to protest against the decision of the central government
 pradarshan kaa faisla party kii ucchstareey samiti ne ek baithak main liya
 The two major political parties of Tamil Nadu, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), have already expressed their stand in the Hindi protests
 donon partiyon kaa kahana he ki 'ek raashtra, ek bhashaa' ke bahaane hindi thopanaa desh ke liye vinaashkari sabit hoga
 The parties responded to the tweet by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, emphasizing the importance of a language for India to have a global identity
 amit shah ne hindi diwas ke avasar par twit kiya tha ki bharat vibhinn bhashaaon kaa desh he or har bhashaa kaa apana mahatv he
 But it is very important to have a language of the whole country, which should become the identity of India in the world
 aaj desh ko ekta kii door main baandhne kaa kaam agar koi ek bhashaa kar sakati he, to vah sarvaadhik boli jane vaali hindi bhashaa hi he
 In response to Amit Shah's tweet, DMK chief MK Stalin said it was shocking
 yah nishchit rup se bharat kii ekta ko prabhavit karegaa
 i appeal to the DMK to withdraw their views
 stallin ne kaha ki party yah tay karegi ki is tarah ke vichaaron kaa kis tarah virodh kiya jaae
 Apart from this, PMK founder s Ramadoss had tweeted that Shah's views on Hindi to be the single language of India are wrong
 unhen hindi diwas par hindi bhashaa ke bare main bolne kaa adhikaar he
 But Hindi cannot be imposed on people who speak other languages

 He claimed that the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee had ordered a probe from the Directorate of Emigration (ED) against him to avenge his role in the dismissal of Shashi Tharoor

 Soon after Tharoor's resignation, the order issued, Lalit Modi said, Lalit Modi said, "by 21 April, the Directorate of Emigration and the agency had started an investigation against me in the foreign exchange, money laundering case
" yah jaanch dakshin africa main yojit ipel-2 main videshi mudra ulanghan jude maamle kii thi
 My lawyer Mahmood Abdi later told me that soon after the resignation of Shashi Tharoor, Pranab Mukherjee ordered an inquiry
 'tharur ko lekar kiya tha khulasabataur lalit modi, 'maine 11 april, 2010 ko daawa kiya tha ki shashi tharur kii divangat patni sunanda pushkar kii kochi ipel frenchiji main 25 fisadi hissedari he or iske liye tharur ne boli lagaai thi

 The state has finally got a new BJP president in the form of Madan Lal Saini
 isi ke saath mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje or party alaakaman ke bich gatirodh bhi dur ho gaya he
 This tension has persisted since Ashok Parnami was asked to withdraw after the by-election defeat in April
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne aresas ko khush rakhane ke saath hi raaje ko bhi naaraaz na karte hue surakshit rasta nikaala he
 Raje was adamant that no such person should be made the state president who can challenge his status or spoil the caste equation in the state
 saini jameen se jude netaa hai jo 1952 se jansangh or aresas main rahe hai
 They come from an OBC caste called Mali
 is prakaar raaje kii bhi is chintaa kaa dhyaan rakhte hue unhen santusht kar diya gaya he ki pradesh adhyaksh jat yaa rajput jati kaa nahin hona chahie
 However, the question of Saini's political efficiency definitely arises because he has won the assembly elections only once in 1990
 uske baad se ve do baar loksabhaa or ek baar vidhansabha chunaav haar chuke hai
 In his first address to the workers, Saini said that he should work in the interest of the party, bypassing his personal grievances
 unhone kaha, ‘‘aapako pataa hona chahie ki sattadhari party main rahane kaa apana alag mahatv or santosh hota he
 Saini said that he should aim to win at least 180 seats in the state's 200-member assembly
