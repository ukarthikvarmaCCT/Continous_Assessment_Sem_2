 The Bharatiya Janata Party today formally informed its ally, JD-U, that conditions such as Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi or youth leader Varun Gandhi not coming to Bihar for campaigning are not allowed

 Senior BJP leader m Venkaiah Naidu said, "BJP and JD-U are keen to run a good government and serve the people
" durbhagyapurna ghatana (bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish or gujarat ke mukhyamantri modi ko saath saath dikhaane vaale vigyaapan evam us par nitish kii pratikriya) se bachaa ja saktaa tha
 He also raised the issue of Nitish returning the flood relief to Gujarat after an advertisement in Patna's local newspapers thanked Modi for help
 naidu ne kaha, ‘‘ hamen pataa nahin ki paanch karod rupaye kis vajah se waapas kiye gayi
 This money did not belong to Narendra Modi and was not given to Nitish Kumar
 
 We do not know why the money was refunded
 isse hamaari bhavanaaen aahat hui hai
 Naidu said that the money given to help the flood victims of Bihar belonged to the people of Gujarat
 unhone kaha ki gathbandhan banaaye rakhane ke liye jad you dwaara sharten rakhe jane ke bare main jo bhi khabaren aa rahi hai, ve media kii atakalbaaji hai or unhen anaavashyak rup se diya ja rahaa he
 Meanwhile, BJP sources said that the top leadership of the party has formally told Nitish that the conditions such as Modi and Varun not being campaigned are not acceptable to them
 bhaajapa pravaktaa saiyad shahanvaj hossain ne kaha, ‘‘ ham bihar ke vikaas ke liye gathbandhan ko jari rakhana chaahate hai lekin atmasamman ke saath samjhauta nahin kiya jayega
 "BJP leaders feel that accepting any condition regarding Modi will weaken his position in the NDA as the Chief Minister of Gujarat is being projected as a national leader
" bhaajapa ke ek varisht saansad ne kaha, ‘‘ rajg ke anya sahyogi bhi ye kah sakate hai ki modi unhen sweekaarya nahin hai or isse samasya or badhegi
 The party sees it as a practical case for Modi's acceptance at the national level before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections

 The BJP has targeted by releasing a film against Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra
 'damaadashri' naam kii film main bijepi ne wadra par apane sabhi aarope nae sire se dohraye hai
 It claimed that the Congress governments of Haryana and Rajasthan illegally helped Vadra in the land deal
 itnaa hi nahin, sonia or rahul par bhi avaidh jameen saudon kii raah aasaan banane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 After the release of this film by the BJP, the Congress camp became enraged
 khabar he ki congress chunaav ayog jane kii taiyaari bhi kar rahi he
 Priyanka Gandhi, while retaliating against the BJP, said that she will not be afraid of such attacks nor will she sit silent
 unhone kaha, 'ye baukhalaaye chuuhe kii tarah daud rahe hai
 i knew that a series of lies would be carried out
 main darungi nahin
 i will continue to speak against their destructive, negative and shameful politics

 i will not sit silent 'bijepi netaa ravishankar prasad ne wadra ke khilaaf aaropon kaa byora diya or sonia-rahul se jawaab kii maang kii
 Accusing Vadra of ignoring the laws, the BJP sought clarification from the Congress on the 'vadra development model'
 bijepi netaa ne kaha ki agar wadra ke paas jameen kii itani hi acchhee jaankaree thi to unhone gaiyr-congress shasit pradeshon main jameen kyon nahin kharidi
 The attack came from the BJP when Priyanka Gandhi surrounded Narendra Modi in Rae Bareli a few hours ago on the pretext of his 56-inch comment
 unhone kaha tha ki desh chalaane ke liye 56 inch kaa seenaa nahin, bada dil or naitik takat kii jarurat hoti he

 delhihighcourt has reprimanded the Delhi government and said that how can you remove the failed 10th students from your own government schools
 naaraaz court ne khud dilli sarkaar se hi kah diya ki fail hue chaatr ek hajaar ho yaa phir das hajaar, 40 hajaar ho yaa phir ek lakh aapako unako dobaaraa admician dena hi hoga
 In fact, in Delhi's government schools, the students who failed in class x were dropped out of the school to improve their results
 baahar nikaale gaye chaatr chaatraon ne hoicourt kaa rukh kiya or hoicourt main aaj unke maamle par sunwaayee karte hue dilli sarkaar ko latad lagaate hue kaha ki sarkari skulon se nikaale gaye bachche aakhir kahaan padhai karenge
 The question of the Delhi High Court was justified because the children of most poor families are taking education in government schools, who do not even have the money to pay the fees
 lihaaja agar sarkari skulon se inkaa naam kaat diya gaya he to phir apni shiksha ko aage barkaraar rakhane kaa in garib bacchon ke paas koi saadhan hi nahin he
 Apart from this, the Delhi government's school policy also clearly states that if a child is weak or has failed, he will not be removed from school
 lekin dilli sarkaar dwaara chalaae ja rahe sarkari skool khud hi dilli ajukeshan act kii dhajjiyaan uda rahe hai
 But the High Court has decided to correct the mistake made by the government schools of the Delhi government
 dilli hoicourt ne shuukravaar ko hui sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki dilli sarkaar ke vakil yaa to mangalvaar yani 28 agast tak sarkaar se instrection lekar aayen ki dilli sarkaar sarkari skulon main fail hue chaatro ko dobaaraa admician de rahi he, yaa phir ham aadesh paas kar denge ki in 10veen ke fail hue 40 hajaar se upar chaatro ko dobaaraa sarkari skool main daakhila de
 The Delhi High Court will hear again on August 28
 aaj tak nahin jabahaicortaye in bacchon se baat kii to vah behad khush dikhe
 In particular, about a dozen girls who reached the High Court said that their breath was stuck whether they would be able to study further or not, but after hearing the High Court today, they hoped that she would be able to continue further

 Vishwanath Gupta (70), president of the Shrimadhik Ramlila committee, which has been doing Ramlila since the year 1924, says, 'many generations have passed

 Currently, preparations are going on for the engagement to be held on April 18

 It is said that four years after that fair, when Baldev Babu block chief of Khadka Purana village won the election of Bhumihar Sakaldev Singh, a well-known resident of Rampur Kachhari, Yadav had specially made donations for the youth of the new youth union
 jaise hi i gaanaa shuru hua or jab tak khatam hua uske bich itnaa goli chalaa ki shaamiyana kaa chadar chhed-chhed ho gaya
 In the twelve villages around, who did not know what was happening, they felt that there was a robbery in the old village with the chief

 Some with sticks, some with a ax, some with a tangari, some with an empty commander's long-focus flashlight

 The talk spread so much that it was said that the fashion of the area had become fashionable
 kahin kisi ke shaadi main, baraat main, hansi-khushi ke kisi maahaul main shaamiyana lagata to tent vaala pehle hi puch letaa tha, naach to nahin bulaaye hai na
 If the answer was yes, then the price of the tent would be kept in the security

 Now new leaders, block-district committees-union presidents, contractor people, market engineers, when a function was done in the village, there was a dance to take special care of the villagers in it
 chanda se jo bijli nikali thi vah tirhut-mithila ke jilon main, gaanvon main falkar nayaa hi rang dikhaane lagi thi
 The second independence dream was broken in the 80 elections
 lekin bihar main khushhaali kaa ek nayaa daur shuru hua
 Plans, projects started to be implemented, works started on them, roads were built, bridges were started
 shaharon main thekedaaron or civil ejeeniyar ke rup main do samrudh virgon kii chamak dikhaai dene lagi thi
 It is said that they used to drink liquor like water in the night behind the high walls of the high-end rooms, there used to be dancing and singing
 ejeeniyar, thekedaar, afasar, netaa ke nayaa varg ban gaya tha
 Now the chic of the old landlords, their tents, was becoming less
 misakot ke paas lichi ke bagan katkar jab coloniyaan bani to unke theke sindhi thekedaaron ko gaye, unhone sirf shahar kii sadaken, ghar hi nahin banaae, unamem apni chamakdaar kothiyaan bhi chamakaayi

 When everything came to a standstill, Babu Saheb had a big discussion in the clubs, societies of the city Muzaffarpur, 28 or in the days when he was throwing rummy leaves
 kuch din baad hi aankh, naak, kaan, galaa rog visheshgy dow
 Suresh Chandra had ordered a second hand Fiat car from Calcutta (he used to say it in those days)
 kehane vaale to yahaan tak kehete hai ki un dinon shahar mujffarpur ke antidaaron main phiet main chalane kaa shauk lag gaya tha
 Ambassador Mark 2 looked like a Fiat 3

 But instead of heavy ambassadors, the smaller-fiat Fiat people had started to eat more

 Sleeping too openly

 Several times the newspapers published reports on the pages of Muzaffarpur that the police raided the quadrangle place late in the night and many of the city's well-known contractors, well-known doctors were caught from there
 aksar pakde ja rahe the
 This was the time when the people of songs and music, the people who play the songs, were moving one by one
 jameendaaron kii jameendaariyaan kamare main tangane vaale jameendaari band main badalata ja rahaa tha
 House-to-house decorations now used to decorate a lot
 kuch puraane jameendaar pariwaron main mehfilein sajati bhi thi to bas ravaayat ke naam par
 It is said that Chanda started a new ritual
 sonpur mela ho yaa bhutahi gaanv kaa mahaviri jhanda logon kii jutan uske naach ke liye bhi hota
 The names of the singers were becoming sorrowful after visiting Seths and Zamindars on the occasion of happiness

 Neither stopped nor tired
 sunaane vaale kissa sunaate, shahar sitamarhi main lohpattee ke dukandaaron ne ‘mahamaya durgapuja samiti’ kaa gathan kiya to lohabajar navayuk sangh ke yuvaaon ne yah faisla kiya ki hamaare puja main kuch khaas item hona chahie
 The best in the city then was the pride of the Durga Puja Committee of the Marwari Navayuk Sangh
 ek saal pehle hi unhone dilli se doremi orcestra ko bulaakar ashtami ko aadhi raat tak program karavaaya tha
 It is said that the superhit song 'om Shanti Om' of that year's interest film Karz
 
 
 o gaao om shanti om!’ ke gane ke liye janaki sthaan vaale niraj bhaiya ne jab paanchavin baar farmaaish kii to orcestra ke star gayak vipin ne gane se saafe manaa kar diya
 Vipin had seven cassettes from Tea Series
 ek saath kishor-rafee or mahendra kapur kii aawaaj main gaata tha
 He clearly said that he has already broken his rule by singing four times already
 yahaan sitamarhi ke darshakon ke liye khaas taur par usne chaar baar is gane ko ga diya
 More than that, he does not sing even in Nagpur, where a fan club runs in his name
 ashtami kii us raat maan durga ne bahut bade kand ko taal diya
 Those who remember remember
 niraj bhaiya kii farmaaish ho or usko manaa kar de koi
 
 
 This did not happen
 
 
 nadi paar shivahar ke saat gaanv ke puraane jameendaar samundar singh ke naam kaa ab bhi sikaa chalata tha
 People used to wait for their worship in the Janaki temple every year
 us din vahaan se koi bhookha nahin ja saktaa tha
 Maa Sita's offerings should reach more and more people
 unke pota ko marwari yuvak sangh ke program main koi manaa kar de
 
 
 Jumum talk! It was very disturbing overnight
 idhar se janaki sthaan ke navayuvak apni aan ke liye kisi ko bhi faad dene ke liye jute the udhar marwari yuvak sangh ke peeche sonapattee, lohapattee, kot bazaar ke navayuvak jute the
 They were saying that it is a matter of respect for the city
 itnaa bada orcestra pehla baar yahaan aayaa he
 Everyone will be respected if something happens
 khub kahasuni hui
 In the end, Mohan Singh Stormani, who lived across the dam, came to a compromise and then the orchestra singer Sonia sang another superhit song of the same year - 'if someone like me comes into your life, then it becomes a matter
 
 
 ’ sab jhagadaa khatam
 
 
 All the young men were singing together below
 
 
 to baap ban jaae!’program khub hit ho gaya
 Those who could not come to see were shocked
 sochate aalas aalas main nahin aane se bahut kuch chhot gaya- itnaa bada orcestra kaa gaanaa
 
 
 Fat-fatty was also missed from above
 kai maheene tak us orcestra vipin ke gaanon kii charchaa rahi
 How did Muhammad Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar sing for everyone
 lohamandi vaale chanda jutaney main koi kami nahin kiye the
 The shopkeepers there had invested money freely in the name of their locality
 murti kii booking bhi saal bhar pehle hi ho gai thi
 The artist of Patna was given half the money in advance
 lekin kuch aisa ho jaae ki is saal unke puja samiti kaa naam ho jaae
 There was a saying in those days that when something is not found, only one name comes up - Chanda
 sach-jhooth to vahi jaanate hai jinhone dekha tha lekin kehete hai ki us saal ashtami kii puja ke baad shaam saat baje jo chanda ne program shuru kiya to agle din navami ko shaam main maan kii puja ke samay tak lagaataar naachati rah gai thi
 There were three orchestras
 ve baari-baari se ek se ek geet bajaate, unke gavaiye gaate lekin asli baat yah thi ki chanda nahin rukii
 Now it was a coincidence that that year was the first year of the 'mahamaya Pooja Samiti' of Lohmandi and last year, the worship area of marwari Navayuvak Sangh had become so shaky that more and more people gathered there
 isliye zyada log chanda ke is karname ko dekh nahin paae the
 Nevertheless, with the signature of 1144 people, a letter from the Guinness Book of World Records was sent, stating that the name of Chanda should be included in order to dance tirelessly for 24 hours without stopping
 kehete hai ki jawaab main ginis book waalon ne koi saboot maanga to puja samiti vaale de nahin paae
 Gautam Prasad, the owner of Sahu Hardware Store, had to say that the award would have been received had Chanda's video recording of that program been present
 lekin tab aisa video recorder shahar main kisi ke paas nahin tha jisamen itani lambi recording bina ruke ho paati
 Therefore, we could not provide any evidence and that incident was lost in the Guinness Book
 saboot ke taur par ve ginis book ke ek lipapha dikhaate the
 But he could not show the letter inside
 kehete the ki baccha log chitthee faad diya
 When he caught his eye, he grabbed the envelope
 so vah batch gaya

 The Patiala House Court of Delhi, hearing today in the JNU treason case, said that the Delhi government (delhi Government) will be summoned for the delay in filing the charge sheet

 The pressure on the government is increasing due to the revelations coming one after the other with the help of Lalit Modi
 buudhvaar ko sanchaar mantri ravishankar prasad ne sushamaa swaraj kaa to bachaav kiya, lekin vasundhara raaje sindhiya ke saath wo khul kar khadey nahin ho paae
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said, "whatever External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj did was done on humanitarian grounds and it cannot be considered wrong under any circumstances
 " On the one hand, in the matter of saving Lalit Modi, while the government and the party have openly defended External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, on the basis of humanitarianism, the government has a different opinion on the case against Vasundhara Raje Scindia
 sindhiya ke khilaaf jis tarah se dastavej saamne aaye hai, uske baad sarkaar ko is maamle main safai dena mushkil ho gaya he
 When reporters asked Ravi Shankar Prasad about Vasundhara, he said, "I have to know the facts in this case
 vasundhara raaje sindhiya or unki sarkaar is maamle par safai denge
 " ye mahatvapurn he ki vasundhara raaje ne jis tarah gopneeyata se lalit modi ke avrajan dastavezon par dastakhat kiye, us par bijepi chup he
 By the way, the small relief for the BJP facing the Congress attack is that it has suddenly got Sharad Pawar's support in the case of Sushma Swaraj
 buudhvaar ko pavaar ne kaha ki jis tarah se is maamle ko badha-chadhaakar media main pesh kiya ja rahaa he, ise publicity di ja rahi he wo isse ittefaq nahin rakhte
 Pawar claimed that how a leader's meeting with someone can be questioned without any investigation
 tippaniyan But the other opposition parties are under pressure on the Narendra Modi government and the BJP for Sushma's resignation
 jedy-you ke rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav ne kaha ki jis tarah se is maamle main lagaataar aarope lag rahe hai uske baad videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko istipha de dena chahie
 The problem is that one after the other, new revelations are being made in the Lalit Modi case and new facts are becoming public, due to which this case seems to be the first major and real political crisis for the Modi government
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha, "videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne jo kuch bhi kiya maanviya aadhaar par kiya or ise kisi bhi paristhiti main galat nahin mana ja saktaa he
 " lalit modi ko bachaane ke maamle main jahaan ek taraf sarkaar or party ne ise maanviyata ke aadhaar par liya gaya faisla bataate hue videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kaa khul kar bachaav kiya he, vahiin vasundhara raaje sindhiya ke khilaaf maamle par sarkaar kii raay alag he
 After the way documents have come out against Scindia, the government has found it difficult to explain in this matter
 jab patrakaron ne ravishankar prasad se vasundhara ke bare main poocha to unhone kaha, "is maamle main mujhe tathyon kii jaankaree leni hogi
 Vasundhara Raje Scindia and her government will explain the matter
 " It is important that the BJP is silent on the way Vasundhara Raje signed Lalit Modi's immigration documents with secrecy
 vaise congress ke hamale jhel rahi bijepi ke liye choti si raahat ye he ki use sushamaa swaraj ke maamle main achaanak sharad pavaar kaa saath mil gaya he
 On Wednesday, Pawar said that the way the matter is being exaggerated in the media, it is being given publicity, they do not agree with it
 pavaar ne daawa kiya ki kisi netaa kii kisi ke saath mulaakaat par bina kisi jaanch-padtaal ke sawaal kaise uthaaya ja saktaa he
 The comments lekin duusare vipakshi dal narendra modi sarkaar or bijepi par sushamaa ke istife ko lekar dabaav banaae hue hai
 JD-U national president Sharad Yadav said that Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj should resign after the manner in which allegations are constantly being made in this case
 mushkil yah he ki ek ke baad ek jis tarah se lalit modi maamle main nae khulaase ho rahe hai or nae tathy saarvajanik ho rahe hai, uski vajah se ye maamla modi sarkaar ke liye pehla bada or asli raajnneetik sankat banataa dikh rahaa he
 On the one hand, in the matter of saving Lalit Modi, while the government and the party have openly defended External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, on the basis of humanitarianism, the government has a different opinion on the case against Vasundhara Raje Scindia
 sindhiya ke khilaaf jis tarah se dastavej saamne aaye hai, uske baad sarkaar ko is maamle main safai dena mushkil ho gaya he
 When reporters asked Ravi Shankar Prasad about Vasundhara, he said, "I have to know the facts in this case
 vasundhara raaje sindhiya or unki sarkaar is maamle par safai denge
 " ye mahatvapurn he ki vasundhara raaje ne jis tarah gopneeyata se lalit modi ke avrajan dastavezon par dastakhat kiye, us par bijepi chup he
 By the way, the small relief for the BJP facing the Congress attack is that it has suddenly got Sharad Pawar's support in the case of Sushma Swaraj
 buudhvaar ko pavaar ne kaha ki jis tarah se is maamle ko badha-chadhaakar media main pesh kiya ja rahaa he, ise publicity di ja rahi he wo isse ittefaq nahin rakhte
 Pawar claimed that how a leader's meeting with someone can be questioned without any investigation
 tippaniyan But the other opposition parties are under pressure on the Narendra Modi government and the BJP for Sushma's resignation
 jedy-you ke rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav ne kaha ki jis tarah se is maamle main lagaataar aarope lag rahe hai uske baad videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko istipha de dena chahie
 The problem is that one after the other, new revelations are being made in the Lalit Modi case and new facts are becoming public, due to which this case seems to be the first major and real political crisis for the Modi government

 It will be released in the year 2020
 saal 2011 main rashtriya str kii wollyboul khilaadi raheen arunima sinha ko kuch gundon ne chalati train se phenk diya tha
 Arunima, who spent the whole night in unbearable pain on the railway track, lost one of her legs in this incident and a rod was applied to her other leg
 aise haadase ke kaaran jahaan aamtaur par jindagi ruk si jaati he, bahut se log kritrim pair ke sahare chalane main chaar se paanch saal laga dete hai, arunima ne ek khilaadi ke taur par apane andar based junun ko barkaraar rakhte hue ghatana ke mahaj do saal ke andar duniya kii sabase oonchi jagah,mount everest fatah kar lee thi
 She made history by becoming the first handicapped female climber to climb the world's highest mountain peak
 arunima kaa yah junun keval ek mahila ke vishwa ke sarvocch shikhar par chadhaai karne kahani nahin he, balki unke atoot vishwaas kii dastaan he, jiske dam par unhone niraashaa ke haathon majaboor hone ke bajaae badi baadhaon ko paar kar apni sabase badi kamajori ko sabase badi takat banane kii himmat dikhaai
 Leaving his pain behind, Arunima not only limited her journey to Mount Everest, but also climbed five other peaks of different continents
 unka lakshya ab sabase kathin chunauti antarctic kii sabase oonchi chotii 'everest vinson masif' par bhartiya paracham lahraane kaa he
 Arunima collided with the train passing the adjacent track and then fell to the ground
 iske baad kya hua, unhen kuch yaad nahin
 She only remembers feeling unbearable pain after regaining consciousness and also realizing that she had lost one of her legs and suffered severe injuries on the other
 unhone kaha, "main madad ke liye chilla rahi thi, lekin aas-paas koi nahin tha, jo meri madad kar saktaa
 Rats were mutilating my injured leg and i kept groaning in pain all night
 maine gina tha, mere paas se 49 train gujri thim
 "in the morning some villagers saw Arunima and took her to a nearby hospital, where doctors had to cut one of her legs and put a rod in the other leg
 arunima ne kaha, "unke paas anaesthesia nahin tha or maine kaha tha ki mujhe bina anaesthesia die hi mere ghayal pair ko thik karen
 i had endured unbearable pain all night and so i knew that i could bear some more pain to recover
 "iske baad, arunima ko nai dilli sthit akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) main sthanantarit kar diya gaya, jahaan vah kareeb chaar maah tak bhartee raheen
 It was here that she pledged that she would climb Mount Everest
 arunima ne kaha, "main jab thodaa thik hui, to maine media main faili afvaahon ke bare main suna
 It was said that i did not have a train ticket and therefore, i jumped from the train
 jab yah baat galat sabit hui to kaha gaya maine aatmahatya karne ke liye train se chalaang lagaai thi
 "he said," i and my family were loudly protesting that all this was a lie, but no one listened to us
 isliye, maine un sabhi logon ko jawaab dene kaa sabase sahi tarika chunaa
 i decided that i would prove what i was before the accident and what i am now
 "durghatana ke baad jis haalat main arunima thim, ushaalat main hill paanaa bhi mushkil hota he
 But, Arunima's story with extraordinary intentions proved to be a story of never losing patience
 jahaan ek ore puri duniya unke iraadon par andeh jataa rahi thi, unke parivaar or khaskar unke jija om prakaash ne unki himmat badhaai
 42-year-old Om Prakash resigned from his Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) job to motivate Arunima towards her goal
 jin halaat main arunima thim, usamen logon ko khadey hone ke liye saalon lag jate hai, vahiin arunima keval chaar maah main hi uth kar khadi ho gayi
 The next two years she trained with Bachendri Pal, the first Indian woman to climb Everest
 unhen spancer mili, unki yatra shuru hui or phir vah din bhi aayaa jab manzil fatah hui
 Arunima said that during this try, blood flowed from her feet and often she also fell
 log unhen pagal kehete the or unhen lagata tha ki vah kabhi apane lakshya main safal nahin ho paaengi
 However, they were all unaware of the strength of their intentions
 unhone kaha, "logon ne meri shaareerik kamajori ko dekhakar apni raay bana lee, lekin mere andar ke junun ko nahin dekha
 Regardless of anyone, i explained myself that i can walk
 mere asahaay pairon ko bhi yah baat samaj aa gai
 "arunima has so far climbed Mount Kilimanjaro (africa), Mount Kojiasco (australia), Mount Akongagua (south America), Carsthenz Pyramid (indonesia) and Mount Elbrus (europe) in addition to Mount Everest on her artificial leg
 is
 antarctic main 'everest : vinson masif' kii chadhaai se pehle arunima ladakh main prashikshan lengi
 He said, "I am going to Antarctica to climb the Vinson Massif in December
 yah saatvaan shikhar he or everest ke baad sabase mushkil bhi
 "arunima just wants to tell the world that if a person is determined to achieve the goal, then no obstacle can stop him
 unhone kaha, "jab main everest shikhar par pahunchi to maine chaha ki main cheekh kar duniya se kahuun ki dekho main vishwa ke sheersh par hum jabaki kisi ko vishwaas nahin tha ki main yah kar sakati hum
 "arunima wishes to establish an International Sports Academy for people with disabilities
 unhone kaha, "iske liye maine kanpur ke paas unnav main jameen kharid lee he
 There is a need to build a building which will cost 55 crores
 lekin, yah ek pair se mount everest par chadhane se adhik mushkil nahin hoga

 The whole world knows Asaram, who satsang in white chola, but is less aware of the real Asaram hidden behind this dress
 ye asaram ladakiyon se rishte banane kaa shaukeen he, ye asaram apane dushman ko thikaane lagava detaa he, ye asaram ayyashi karata he or yahi asaram ekantavaas ke naam par shishyaaon kaa yon shoshan karata he
 We are not saying this, rather it is to say that those seekers who had spent a long time with Asaram, who have seen the truth of Asaram with their eyes, after seeing that their conscience are now preventing them from remaining silent
 duusare lafzon main kahen to asaram ke ek nahin, kai chehre hai
 The mask is going to be removed one by one from these faces of Asaram
 asaram vyasapeeth par baithta he, pravachan karata he
 Teaches the world of virtue and celibacy and claims to relieve their suffering from their spiritual powers and medicines
 jaahir he, asaram kaa yahi wo cheharaa he, jisaki badaulat duniya main lakhon log asaram kii taraf khinche chale aate hai lekin asaram ko kareeb se jaananevaalon kii maane to asaram kaa ye cheharaa, cheharaa kam balki naqaab zyaada he asli asaram to koi or he
 This Asaram comes down on his reality as soon as he is away from the eyes of the world
 vyasapeeth se baithe-baithe uski nigahen ladakiyon kii talash main aise gumti he ki phir wo ekantavaas kii kutiyaa main aa kar hi thamati he
 This Asaram not only wants to have a relationship with girls, but is always trying to bring younger and innocent girls closer to him and sometimes he enjoys bathing in swimming pool with girls and he Also gives her massage
 asaram kaa ye cheharaa sant kaa nahin, balki shaitan kaa he
 He starts living like a criminal as soon as he comes down from the pulpit
 ye gaaliyaan detaa hai or apane khilaaf bolanewaale logon ko thikaane bhi lagava detaa he
 Earning money from different handcuffs and trying to get close to girls as soon as they get an opportunity is the most favorite pastime of Asaram and hundreds of people are blinded by blind faith in Asaram's ashram
 ab asli asaram se waakif uske sadhak rahe puraane log hi asaram ke khilaaf kaanoon kii madad karne ke liye aage aane lage hai
 Obviously, Asaram's troubles are not going to end yet
 vahiin duusari ore drama, swang or nautanki kii badaulat asaram ke bete narayan sai lambey vakt tak duniya kii ankhon main dhul jhonkate rahe lekin ab unke bare main unheen ke ek puraane sevadaar ne jo khulaasa kiya he, wo naa sirf chaunkaanewaala balki sharmnaak he
 According to this sevadar, Narayan not only used to sexually abuse girls in the name of seclusion like his father, but also the design of the solitary cottage in the ashrams was specially designed for sexual abuse
 awwal to ekantavaas kii kutiyaa bheed-bhaad se dur hoti thi, upar se unamem ek nahin, balki do darvaaze hote the, taaki ladki ke saath koi narayan sai yaa asaram ko ek saath kutiyaa ke andar jate yaa baahar aate dekh naa le or jarurat ke mutabik duusare darvaaze kaa istemaal kiya ja sake
 Narayan used to take the girls to the hut of seclusion and when he was full of time with the girl, he would get out of the hut and use code language to ask his servant to clean the room
 darasal, ye cameraa saafe karne kaa matlab saaf-safaai nahin, balki ladki ko kamare se baahar nikaalnaa hota tha
 Mahendra Chawla, a former serviceman of Narayan Sai, says that at first he used to be a devotee of Asaram and Narayan Sai, but when he saw the truth of both with his own eyes, then he was shocked that he started living in depression and came out of it It also took him years of time
 is purv sadhak kii maane to asaram kaa trust dharm karm kii jagah nahin, balki jurm or dhandhebaazi kaa wo thikaana he, jisamen ladakiyon ke saath zyaadati or paise kamanaa hi iklauta makasad he
 Asaram and Narayan Sai apply the money received from the people on interest and if someone fails to give these money on time or is inappropriate then they are recovered with the help of police and goons
 chawla kehete hai ki unhone baap-bete kii karatuuton ke silsile main sirf gujarat hi nahin, balki haryana police se bhi shikaayat kii thi, lekin har baar uski shikaayat ko thande baste main daal diya gaya or gujarat kii dike trivedi kamishan ke saamne apane bayaan main bhi usne ashram main chal rahe galat dhandhon ke bare main bataaya tha, lekin tab kamishan ke adhikariyon ne unke baton kii ansuni kar di
 Now after seeing the allegations of rape after succession, the way Narayan Sai is running away from the police, it seems that where there is smoke, there is definitely fire
 abhi desh kaa dhyaan lagaataar ho rahi firing or javaanon kii shahadat se hataa hi nahin tha
 Now two suspicious bags have been found in Pathankot on Thursday morning
 ye bag mamun kaint ke paas mili hai

 Let us tell you that there has been continuous firing on the indo-pak border for the last few days
 aapako bataa den ki mangalvaar kopthankot or gurdaspurilaake main ek sandigdh scorpiyo baraamad hui thi

 Seven soldiers were killed in the encounter with the terrorists and 37 people were injured
 sabhi hamalavar aatanki bhi maare gaye the
 But even a year after this attack, it cannot be said that our country is capable of defending Pakistan sponsored terrorism
 saat jawan hue the shaheederebase stesan par hue aatanki hamale main kul saat jawan shahid hue the
 Those who sacrificed their lives for the country include Lieutenant Colonel Niranjan p Kumar (kerala), Subedar Fateh Singh (gurdaspur), Havildar Kulwant Singh (gurdaspur), Constable Jagdish Singh (himachal Pradesh), Constable Sanjeevan Kumar (sihuan), Constable Gurusavek Singh
 (haryana), and Moolraj (jammu and Kashmir)
 upie ke phir sarkaar banane kaa vishwaas vyakt karte hue rahul gandhi ne jor dekar kaha ki bijepi ke prachaar kaa 'gubbaaraa' 2004 ke 'india shining' kii hi tarah fat jayega
 Also warned that Narendra Modi's coming to power will be harmful for the country
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke saath rahul ne aagaah kiya ki modi kii vichaardhaara bharat ke vichaar ke khilaaf he or congress puri patibaddhta se yah sunishchit karne ke liye sangharsh karegi ki yah vichaardhaara parrast ho
 Releasing the party's manifesto, he did not favor the opinion poll which projected the upa's poor performance in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 unhone kaha ki jab chunavi nattejey saamne aaenge, har kisi ko achraj hoga
 Regarding the tremendous publicity of the NDA, Rahul said that the 'india Shining' balloon was torn like, i can say from the claim that this balloon will explode in the same way
 unhone kaha ki visheshkar aisa uttar pradesh main hoga, jahaan 80 siten daanv par hai
 Rahul said that BJP has the ability to carry forward the propaganda like 'india Shining', but everyone should keep in mind that when the 2004 results came out, that campaign disappeared
 bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue rahul ne kaha ki vah vyaktigat rup se modi ke virdohi nahin hai, lekin vah unki vichaardhaara ke khilaaf hai, jo bharat ke vichaar ke viruddh he
 Aam Aadmi Party's Chandni Chowk MLA Alka Lamba is not going to the Congress at the moment
 vah aam aadmi party main hi rahengi
 At present, the dispute between the Aam Aadmi Party and Alka Lamba has been resolved
 khud alka lamba ne isaki jaankaree dete hue kaha ki 'khushkhabari, aap dwaara dobaaraa sabhi grups main jod liya gaya he, meetings ke phone bhi aane lagen hai, somvaar se chandani chowk loksabhaa ke aap ummidavaar ke liye prachaar ke liye utar rahi hum
 Assured to do everything right '
 aapako bataa den ki disambar 2018 main alka lamba or aam aadmi party ke bichvivaad kii shuruyaat hui thi
 In fact, one such proposal to withdraw Bharat Ratna from former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in the 1984 anti-sikh violence case was passed in the Delhi Assembly
 aam aadmi party sutron kaa kahana tha ki alka lamba ne mul prastaav main somnath bharti se kuch badlaav karavaaya (mul prastaav main rajeev gandhi se bharat ratna waapas lene kii baat nahin thi) jiske chalate party kii kirakiri hui jabaki alka lamba kaa kahana tha ki unhone rajeev gandhi se bharat ratna waapas lene ke prastaav par samarthan dene se inkaar kar diya tha or vidhansabha ke sadan se nikal gai thi, jabaki party unako is prastaav kaa samarthan karne ke liye kah rahi thi
 Since then, Alka Lamba was removed from all whatsapp groups of the Aam Aadmi Party and was not being invited to any party meeting
 yahaan tak ki dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne jab chandani chowk vidhansabha kshetra, jahaan se alka lamba vidhayak hai vahaan par pichley maheene jansabha kii tab bhi sthaneey vidhayak alka lamba ko nahin bulaayaa gaya
 Due to such stance of the party, Alka Lamba was ready to go to the Congress
 beete hafte dilli congress ke prabharee pisi chaako ne kaha tha ki agar alka lamba congress main aati hai to unhen khushi hogi kyonki alka lamba pehle bhi congress main rah chuki hai
 In response, Alka Nama said that he has not received any proposal from Congress but if any such proposal is received then it will be a matter of honor for me because i have given 20 years of my life to the Congress Party
 iske baad aam aadmi party ke mukhya pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha tha ki agar alka lamba aam aadmi party chhodkar congress main jaati hai to unako vidhayak pad se istipha dena hoga
 Overall, there was a lot of controversy between Alka Lamba and Aam Aadmi Party and it was almost certain that Alka Lamba could go to the Congress anytime as she was in the Congress earlier too, but now the dispute seems to be resolved at the moment
 shaayad aam aadmi party ne is baat ko samajha he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan agar unki vidhayak party chhodeygi to party ke liye yah achche sanket nahin maane jaaenge
 At the same time, many leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party have either left the party or been fired
 agar yah silsilaa yun hi chalata rahegaa to party ke liye nakaaratmakataa badhati chali jaaegi
 Therefore, the Aam Aadmi Party has currently tried to avert a crisis by resolving this dispute

 karodon cricketpremi bhale hi maanate hon lekinschin tendulkarka kahana he ki vah cricket ke bhagwaan nahin he or vah bhi galtiyaan karte hai
 "I am not the God of cricket," Tendulkar said on the sidelines of a promotional event
 main bhi galtiyaan karata hum, bhagwaan nahin karte
 Tendulkar, who has had almost all the batting records to his name, said that he initially wanted to be a mixed form of Sunil Gavaskar and Vivian Richards
 sachin tendulkar par visheshtendulkarne bacchon ke sawaalon ke jawaab main kaha,‘main baccha tha tab sunil gavaskar bananaa chahta tha
 Vivian Richards drew me in when i grew up
 main hameshaa se sochataa tha ki main in donon kaa mila jula rup ban sakuun
 'sachin can play for 7 more years, because
 
 
 aadhunik cricket ke sabase mukammil ballebaaj maane jane vaale tendulkar ne us daur ko yaad kiya jab 100wein antarrashtriya shatak ke liye unhen lanbaa intjaar karnaa padaa tha
 He said, 'when i scored my 100th international century, i was not cheering or celebrating
 maine bhagwaan se pehla sawaal kiya ki itnaa lanbaa samay kyon laga
 What mistake did i make? jab karodon log iskaa intjaar kar rahe the to itnaa lanbaa samay nahin laganaa chaiye tha
 Tendulkar said, "where am i left behind?" i worked hard and also got close to a century in the World Cup semi-final against Pakistan
 us samay sabhi kaa focus vishwa cap par tha
 After that there was great disappointment but this is life
 ’yah poochne par ki yadi cricketer nahin hote to vah kya hote, tendulkar ne kaha ki unke paas adhik vikalp nahin he
 He said, 'I don't think i had much options
 schuli bacchon ko meraa anusaran nahin karnaa chaiye
 It is important to study
 maine padhai or cricket ke bich santulan banane kii koshish kii lekin kar nahin sakaa
 Cricket gave me sleepless nights
 main khel se is kadar pyaar karata tha
 'he said,' Many times i used to carry tennis racket in one hand and bat in the other
 bees minute tak tennis kheltaa or 20 minute cricket
 i enjoy playing tennis
 ’unhone kaha,‘mere liye cricket ke bina jivan kii kalpana mushkil he
 Other than that, there is only tennis
 ’ In a video leaked on Wednesday, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has been seen telling Congress workers that the Congress can contest elections alone in Maharashtra and does not want to continue its alliance with NCP
 isse is baat kii pushti hoti he ki sahyogi dal congress kii chahat nahin balki zarurat hai
 2004 saw a historic change in the policy of the Congress party when Congress President Sonia Gandhi reached her house to meet Ram Janlas Paswan, the head of the Lok Janshakti Party
 is kadam se yah dikhaane kii koshish kii gai ki congress ne apane manovaigyanik rukaawat ko dur kar gathbandhan kii raajnneeti ko puure man se sweekaar kar liya he
 After this an alliance was formed
 lekin aath saal baad ek baar phir congress ne apni ranneeti par kaam karnaa shuru kar diya he
 When Rahul's influence increased in the Congress, by 2009, the Congress, which was talking about coalition religion, was seen to be showing strength against its allies to return to UP
 is pratisparddha ke saath hi congress main 'ekala chalo re' project ko bal mila
 Lalu Prasad Yadav became the first victim of this policy of Congress
 uske baad 2012 ke vidhaan sabha chunaav ke dauraan samaajawaadee party ne congress ke dhamandi swabhaav kaa swaad chakhaa
 After that, one by one the UPA allies started leaving and those who are still together are due to the compulsion of some regional politics
 lekin andar hi andar unke bich kii khai chaudee hoti ja rahi he
 In Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, bets have changed from defeat
 jo pehle shikaar ho rahe the, aaj shikari ban baithe hai kyonki kshetreey takatein congress or bijepi ke khilaaf ekajute hai
 According to NCP spokesperson DP Tripathi, 'the most important thing in Indian politics at present is that no party is capable of forming a government alone
 aaj koi bhi dal 'big bos' kii bhoomika nibhaane main sakasham nahin he'
 He says, 'his party is not happy with this video of Rahul but he has to run the government in Maharashtra
 aankadon kaa khelaagamee aam chunaav ko dekhte hue ek baar phir congress bhram kii sthiti main hai
 To a large extent, this is also the position of BJP
 donon dal ne hi chunavi ladaai kii shuruyaat apane moulik sahyogiyon ko saath karne kii thaanee he
 Right now they are not in the mood to race to gather allies
 congress ke kuch netaaon kaa maananaa he ki party ke pradarshan par hi sabakuch nirbhar he or ummid jataai ki bijepi se kahin zyada congress sahyogi dal juta legi
 Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari believes that the question of gathering allies arises only after the support of the public
 donon dalon kaa lakshya 272 siten jeetna he
 But both Congress and BJP will have to be satisfied with this figure only
 khel mantri or congress ke gathbandhan samiti ke sadsy jitendra prasad singh ne sanket die hai ki unki party chunaav ke baad bhi nae sahyogi dalon se gathbandhan kar sakati he
 Congress is expected to get support from JDU, Left and other secular parties
 jediu netaa kasee tyaagi kehete hai ki 2014 chunaav ke baad dilli main jediu kii kya bhoomika hogi, ye to kahana mushkil he
 But it is definitely that we will not be with BJP
 'congressi sutron ke mutabik eiediemke-bijepi gathbandhan kii vajah se diemke kaa saath ek baar phir se congress ko mil saktaa he
 This formula will apply to lalu-nitish's party and SP-BSP
 sirf congress ko chunanaa he
 No one can prove better than Modi for the Congress
 biju-janata dal bhi modi ko lekar khush nahin he
 Power changes a lot
 isliye 272 ke aankade ke sahi mantra kaa pataa chunaav ke baad hi chalegaa
 Whose inclination is 1

 This is the largest amount allocated in the last 12 years

 Kanimozhi's youngest daughter Kanimozhi's re-election to the Rajya Sabha is doubtful after DMK chief m Karunanidhi split from Kanimozhupa
 ye mana ja rahaa he ki 2 ji cese main 6 maheene baad jail se kanimojhi ke nikalne par donon dalon ke bich kuch kaduvaahat kam hui he
 It is possible that the two teams are together again

 India's nuclear deal with the United States in Left UP-1 separated the Congress and the Left
 aisi khabaren aa raheen hai ki donon dal phir saath ho sakate hai
 The Left is a trusted ally whose Congressmen also value
 sabase khaas ki donon ek-duusare ke natural sahyogi dal hai
 The only issue of dispute between the two is Manmohan Singh and his economic policies
 magar left netaaon ke sonia gandhi se achche sambandh hai

 jagan mohan reddiandhra pradesh main congress ko safaya kaa andeshaa he
 But in the midst of all this, just 8 months before the election, the release of Jagan Mohan Reddy, the head of the YSR Congress, jailed for 484 days, is understandable
 jagan rajya main behad charchit hai
 Due to this in 2009, Congress got 39 seats in 42 Lok all seats of the state
 saath hi saath vidhaan sabha ke 294 siton main se 146 seat par congress jeet hasil karne main safal hui thi
 According to Vikram Dalal, MD, Synergy Capital Services, at a time when interest rates are coming down, investors should consider this investment option
 lekin chunki ye trade karne yogya bond nahin hai or na hi inkaa sthanantaran kiya ja saktaa he, isliye nivesh se pehle is pahalu par bhi puri tarah se gaur kar len
 The comments dalal ke mutabik, jo log 30 fisadi tex braket main aa rahe hai unke liye texfri bond ek acha he jo 8
 Giving interest at the rate of 75 percent
 inamen ek acchhee baat yah bhi he ki texfri bonds kii trading bhi kii ja sakati he
 Investors were fascinated by the tax free bonds being issued by government institutions for the last few years but no new tax free bonds will be issued in this financial year
 chunki tex free bonds kii exange main trading kii ja sakati he isliye inhen senkendry market se bhi kharida ja saktaa he
 According to the broker, taxfree bonds are good for those who are in the 30% tax bracket, which is 8
 75 fisadi kii dar se byaaj de rahe hai
 One of the good things among them is that taxfree bonds can also be traded
 sarkari sansthaanon dwaara pichley kuch saalon se jari kiye ja rahe tex free bonds ko lekar niveshkon main aakarshan tha lekin is vittiya varsh main koi nae tex free bond jari nahin kiye jaaenge
 Since tax free bonds can be traded on the exchange, they can also be purchased from the secondary market

 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii odisha main bolnagir kii yatra asthai heliped ke nirmaan ke liye pedo kii kataai ko lekar vivaad ke ghere main aa gai
 According to some media reports, about 3000 trees were felled for the construction of helipeds on the railway land
 haalanki van vibhaag ke adhikariyon ne jaanch kii baat kahi he lekin railway ne aise daavon ko sire se khaarij kiya he
 India Today Fact Check found that the claim is not completely true
 heliped ke nirmaan ke liye ginati ke hi kuch ped or paudhe hataae gaye
 Almost all the major newspapers and websites such as 'the Indian Express', 'the Hindu', 'the Week' and 'kalinga TV' have claimed that hundreds to thousands of trees were cut to make helipeds
 ‘oppindia’ne daawa kiya ki aisi sari reports juthi hai
 This website falsely claimed that India Today's flagship 'india Times' reported the news on the basis of The Hindu
 yahaan ham bataanaa chahenge ki pehali baat to ye ki india today kaa india times se koi naata nahin he
 Secondly, India Today never reported the issue
 india today ne badi sankhya main pedo kii kataai ke aaropon ke peeche tathyon ko veriphai karne kii swatantra rup se koshish kii
 We contacted Sameer Satpathy, Divisional Forest Officer, Bolangir
 unhone kaha, “modi ke daure ke liye bina anumati liye heliped ke nirmaan ke vaaste railway stesan ground ke paas kuch ped giraae gaye
 According to Satpathy, an inquiry has been ordered into the matter
 satpathi kaa kahana he ki 2016 main yahaan shahari paudharopan kaarykram ke tahat 3,500 paudhe lagaae gaye the
 Our local correspondent Sufi sent some photos of the area
 in photo main heliped ke paas kuch hi paudhon ko ukhde or pedo ke tanon ko zamin par gire dekha ja saktaa he
 When India Today Fact Check contacted senior officials of East Coast Railway, they dismissed claims of thousands of trees being cut
 railway kii shuruuaati jaanch report ke mutabik 40 jhaadiyon or paudhon se zyada ko nahin hataaya gaya
 According to the report, as part of the program preparations, axes were fired on six trees on the railway land and some were trimmed
 sawaalon ke ghere main ai khaas jagah par paudhon or hariyaali kii sthiti jaanane ke liye india today ne bolnagir railway stesan ke paas dukaan chalaane vaale suraj treepathi se sampark kiya
 Tripathi assured us of cooperation in the investigation and reached the spot
 unhone hamen google maps ke jariye uplabdh apni jiyolocation bheji
 With the help of Google Earth, we identified the actual location of the satellite image
 november 2018 ke aakhir main lee gai jagah vishesh kii tasviir dikhaati he ki ek maheene pehle bhi wo khaali hi jagah thi
 The satellite picture thus rejected claims that thousands of trees existed in that area
 tasviir main ginati ke hi ped vahaan dekhe ja sakate hai
 India Today Fact Check has proved that the claims of some media institutions about cutting thousands of trees are not true
 asal main kuch ginati ke ped hi kaate gaye or kuch paudhe ukhaade gaye

 main to soch rahaa tha clivej vaali charchaa khatm ho chuki he, lekin lagata he ki isamen kuch gunjaaish abhi baaki he
 Before i start my debate, i will make it clear that here i will be talking purely around aesthetics and diversity of language
 yahaan naitikta yaa vidrohi tewaron kii saraahna ke chakkar main padane kaa apana koi iraadaa nahin he
 However, like other people, the question flashed in my mind whether there is any word in Hindi, Sanskrit or Urdu for this
 apana dimag lagane par mujhe ek shabd soojha ‘ur sandhi’ lekin ise mitron ne khaarij kar diya
 Then i remembered my college era
 14 saal pehle kaa kaliyasot dam or uske neeche hariyaali main basaa bhopal kaa excilence college dikhaa
 Prof
 sitting in the Hindi department
 vijay bahadur singh dikhaai die
 They are talking on 'kumar Sambhav' of Kalidas
 bataa rahe hai ki tapasya main leen parvati kaa varnan karte hue mahakavi bataate hai ki pani kii boond unke sir se girane ke baad sharir ke kis-kis komal bhaag ko choote hue aage bad rahi he
 Immediately called Sir
 unhone bhi kalidas ke panne palate lekin vahaan kuch khulaa kuch ughadaa ang ke aasapaas kii hi baat mili
 Even the great poet did not feel the need for the exact word
 aadhe ghante baad sar kaa phir phone aayaa
 In the meantime he gave the director of Sanskrit Institute of Agra, Prof
 aaazaad mishra se paraamarsh kiya
 Mishra ji also did not get the pre-eminent word in this subject
 lekin unhone ek shabd gadhane kii salaah di
 This word is 'kuch Sandhi'
 ’ sanskrit main stan kaa ek paryaay kuch bhi he
 i got the word, but in this half an hour i had made a call to my father Mr
 Om Prakash Babelle and Professor Prof Dilip Shakya in Jamia
 dilip ne sidhe kaha ki paribhaashik shabd nahin milegaa
 Then he got down into Prasadji's success
 sunaaya, 'nil paridhaan bich sukumaar khil rahaa mridul adhkhula ang, khilaa ho jyon bijli kaa phool megh van bich gulabi rang'
 His gesture was towards 'mridul akhkula ang'
 prasad ji isi ko clivej ke liye istemaal kar rahe hai
 By the way, in the dictionary of Hardev Outer, another gimmicky word 'breast middle' is found for it, but it is not lavani
 india today ke cultural editor shivakesh ji ne haalanki mere sawaal kaa puure 24 ghante baad jawaab diya or kaha ki vaksh shabd paryaapt he
 However, i am not satisfied with this either
 in charchaaon ke bich pitaaji kaa phone aa gaya
 He took up the affair from Kadambari of Banabhatta
 yahaan nayika varnan main kaha gaya stanon ke bich kaa hriday desh
 But no word here
 bada tajjub ho rahaa he ki kamasutra, kalidas, bihari or geet govind ke desh main is shabd kii khaas jarurat hi mahasoos nahin kii ja rahi he
 Is it not so that the Indian aesthetic sense is able to say its own thing because of its elegance by saying curtain or Beparda, and it does not need a rough word like cleavage
 vaise bhi maine bundelkhand main mahilaon ko stanon se jude kisi bhi prasang main sirf anchal shabd hi suna he, zyada hua to chaati kah diya
 That is, in the tradition, the strength of the symptom is dripping, we are only a little dependent on Abhidha

 Student of the Year 2 class rooms have been set up in theaters
 film main ananyaa pandey, tara sutaria kaa debyue, tiger shraf kaa lead role he
 The story of the film is about these three, but how is this film, it is very important to understand the world of Karan Johar
 kyonki ye karan johar ke production se nikali ek kaalpanik kahani he
 Which has nothing to do with real life
 film kii kahani shuru hoti he dehradun ke ek kaaman boy rohan (tiger shroff) se, jo apni garlfriend mridula (tara sutaria) se sachche aashiquon vaali mohabbat karata he
 Mridula is a girl who is running after high society and big dreams
 kehane ko bachapan se use rohan se pyaar he, lekin sapanom ke aage wo rohan ko bhuulane main vakt nahin lagaati
 Mridula also takes her name as Desi
 isliye wo ise badalakar mia kar detii he
 Mia is the daughter of the rich father, so she studies at St
 Teresa, the college of the rich
 uske pyaar main rohan bhi apana college chhodkar saint terresa college main admician le letaa he, lekin paison se nahin sports cote main
 Here the two meet with two children from the trustees of St
 Teresa's College and the college's stars Shreya (ananya Pandey) and Manav (aditya Seal)
 shreya or maanav se pehali mulaakaat main mia to maanav kii divaani ho jaati he lekin rohan par shreya kaa koi khaas asar nahin hota he
 From the very first day of college, there is a tussle between Rohan and Ananya
 kahani kii is shuruyaat ke baad college main dance compatishan hota he
 Both Mia and Shreya have to win the competition
 aise main shreya kaa jodidar banataa he uskaa bhai or mia ko jeet dilaane ke liye uskaa jodidar banataa he rohan
 In the competition, Shreya and Manav's team win
 lekin is bich rohan kii garlfriend mia use chhodkar maanav ke paas chali jaati he
 There is a debate between Rohan and Manav and Rohan is fired for raising his hand on Trusty's son
 college se nikaale jane ke baad maanav use martha he or lujar of da year kaa khitaab de detaa he
 Trista arrives in the story and Shreya forgets her passion and becomes Rohan's girlfriend
 lekin rohan ko ab jeetna he student of da year kaa aword, college se nikaale jane par usne maanav ko iskaa chalange bhi kiya tha
 The battle to win the Student of the Year trophy begins now
 ye jang hoti he 8 collejon ke bich
 St
 Teresa was winning this award for two years from the College of Man
 vahiin pishorilaal chamandas college jeetna to dur hameshaa 8wein number par rahaa he
 The title war is the climax of the film
 acting ke maamle main film ko jaj karnaa galat he, kyonki kisi kirdaar main nayaa kuch bhi nahin he
 In the entire film, Tiger Shroff students seem more superheroes
 jise khaali sadak paar kerani ho to wo vahaan bhi flip maar kar paar karegaa
 Dance and Action Tiger have shown their skills in the film
 kahani kaa puraa boj tiger ke kandho par he ye bhi saaf najar aata he
 According to Tiger, the story is written only after looking at the dance skill and action of the story
 film main tara sutaria hokar bhi nahin hai
 Ananya Pandey in front of her does both comedy and drama better in many scenes
 bhale hi film ke poster main tara ko jagah di gai he lekin unase zyada bada role he aditya sil kaa
 He has got more scenes in the film
 film ke baaki kirdaaron main samir soni or manoj pahwa ne role ke hisaab se thik adaakaari kii he
 But Hollywood star Will Smith is in the surprise package
 jo bas ek gane main do steps karke chale jate hai
 The second Gul Panag, after a long time, is in a small roll
 dialogs or ganepahali film se tulana karen to uske gane zyada behatar hai
 The new package is dry in the name of purposeless songs and dialogue
 puri film dekhne ke baad ek bhi dialog yaad nahin rahaa jaataa
 Direction Puneet Malhotra has taken up the direction for the third time
 phul masala movie banane ke chakkar main wo bhul gaye ki film kaa diarection kya hoga
 The truth is that in the case of directions, it has taken a hat trick of Puneet
 iske pehle wo do flop filmein bana chuke hai
 You are a diehard fan of Tiger Shroff and if you want to see the latest fashion trends, then you will like this film
 lekin kisi shandaar romantic lav story ko dekhnaa chaahate hai to ye film puri tarah se fail he

 Manisha, where did you get inspiration for your writing? loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bhartiya janata party ko sahyogi dalon ne apane tevar dikhaane shuru kar die hai
 Apna Dal will not attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Ghazipur on Saturday
 apana dal cote se modi sarkaar main mantri anupriya patel dilli airport se waapas laut ai hai
 Apart from Apna Dal, Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party will not participate in this program
 yah donon partiyaan bijepi kii aguwai vaali endie kaa hissaa he
 Let me tell you, PM Narendra Modi is going to Ghazipur on Saturday
 vah yahaan ek medical kalege kii aadharshila rakhenge
 Also the Maharaja will issue postage stamp on Suheldev
 iske baad piem modi artiai maidan main jansabha ko sambodhit karenge
 Modi's program is opposed by Om Prakash Rajbhar, a minister in the BJP government of UP and President of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party
 unka kahana he ki dak tikat par maharaja suheldev rajbhar kaa puraa naam ankit nahin he
 This is an insult to them
 yah kehete hue unhone bhi piem modi kii raily se duuri bana lee he
 At the same time, now Apna Dal is boycotting this program of Modi
 apana dal ne uttar pradesh ke sabhi sarkari kaaryakramon se khud ko dur karne kaa elaan kiya he
 Behind this, the national president of Apna Dal and Ashish Patel, husband of Anupriya Patel, is being said to be a big reason to be kept away from the Prime Minister's welcome programs
 iske saath hi endie se loksabhaa siton ko lekar chal rahaa uskaa vivaad jab tak sulajh nahin jaataa, tab tak apana dal modi or yogi sarkaar ke sarkari kaaryakramon kaa hissaa nahin rahegaa
 Allegations of not paying respect: Your party's national president Ashish Patel has accused the BJP government of not paying respect
 beete dinon unhone kaha tha ki gathbandhan main sammaan chaahate hai
 We wish that we get respect and form a government again under the leadership of Narendra Modi
 bhaajapa ko teen pradeshon main mili paraajay se sikh leni chahie
 He also said that even after the assurance, the leaders of Apna Dal have not been given a place in any commission

 Kasab arrived in 2008, then Kasim in 2015
 kasaab lashkar kaa commander tha
 Qasim Lashkar's fighter
 kasaab pakistan ke faridakot ke okara gaanv kaa tha
 Kasim is a resident of Ghulam Mohammad Abad Colony of Faisalabad
 kasaab garib parivaar se niklaa tha
 Qasim originated from the Midis class family
 kasaab fidayin tha
 Qasim just the attacker
 ji haa, ab pakistan kii jameen par taiyaar hone vaale aatankwaadiyon main bhi bada parivartan aane laga he
 Lashkar who till yesterday used to stand up for terror in the name of Islam only to poor boys
 vah ab padhe-likhe ladakon ko bhi apane saath jod rahaa he
 It is coming to light that whether the strategy of Lashkar terror has changed in the same way as when questions were raised about Lashkar in Pakistan after the attack on Parliament, Hafiz Saud made himself jamaat-ul-dawa - was called clean
 lashkar 1986 main bana,to 2002 main jamaat-ul-daawa
 The biggest difference between the two was that Lashkar would have picked up a gun, but jamaat-ul-dawa would have worked socially
 lashkar ke saath zyaadaatar islam ke naam par bandook uthaane vaale vaise yuva judate, jo garibi se nikle the yaa phir islam ke naam par aatank ko bhi jaij tehraate
 But now three questions have become important
 iskaa jawaab bahut jaruri he
 The first question is that is Lashkar being able to connect terror with urban youth? Second, are educated fighters picking up guns instead of fidayeen? And third, whether the capture of Qasim is part of Lashkar's strategy? The third is important because there was no shirk on Kasim's face
 vah jis tarah pakadaa gaya usase lagata he ki yaa to use fidayin kii trainin sahi tareeke se nahin hogi yaa vah khud kii pahchaan banane ke liye fidayin nahin bana he

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator Talking about the failure of Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah to control the situation in Kashmir, the BJP demanded from the Center to ensure that it takes action against the divisive and anti-national forces in the state
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya pravaktaa tarun vijay ne samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘‘umr abdulla kashmir ghati main vijajankaree or raashtra virdohi shaktiyon par niyantran karne main vifal rahe hai
 The Center must take action to see that it takes action against those elements
 ’’ kashmir ghati main haalia ashaanti main pakistan kaa haath saaf taur par dikhataa he
 He said that Union Home Minister p Chidambaram had no basis for talks with his Pakistani counterpart
 vijay ne kaha, ‘‘chidambaram kii apane pakistani samakaksh rahamaan malik se vaarta or donon deshon ke bich videsh sachiv str kii vaarta kaa koi aadhaar nahin tha
 Until Pakistan provides concrete evidence that it is not supporting anti-india activities, there is no point in negotiating with that country
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘videsh mantri es em krishna ne pehle pakistan ko sabhi tarah ke aatankwaad kaa centre bataaya tha, lekin achaanak pakistan ke saath spasht america dabaav ke tahat vaarta hui
 He said that the resolution passed unanimously in Parliament said, "we should regain the portion of Kashmir occupied by Pakistan
" pradhanmantri ko desh se kehane den ki usapar amal karne ke liye unki sarkaar kya kar rahi he
 '' rajasthan ke kai jile bhayankar garmi kii chapet main hai
 Alam is that in the districts like Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Barmer, the daytime temperature is reaching 50 degrees
 itani bheeshan garmi ke baavjood hamaare BSF ke jawan seemaa par datakar border kii suraksha karte hai
 In order to provide relief to the BSF jawans from the heat, it has been decided to air-condition the observation tower on the border
 BSF kii 56 batalian jaisalmer main kuch jagahon par air condishan objaraveshan post banaae gaye hai
 From here the BSF personnel will keep an eye on the tricks of Pakistan
 is objaraveshan post ke andar vah sari suvidhaayen hongi jiske jariye biguef ke jawan kai ghanton tak is retile bavandar ke bich apni hifaazat kar sarhad kii suraksha kar sakate hai
 According to the information, there is a plan to make an air conditioned observation post of this manner every 3 kilometers around Fencing, which will be activated in the summer
 abhi aise karte hai garmi se bachawthar ke registan main 50 degree tak garmi padana saamaanya baat he
 Especially May is always hot
 aise main jawan pehle se iske liye taiyaar rahete hai
 Even in such severe heat, patrolling of the soldiers never stops
 javaanon ko yahaan garmi se bachaane ke liye lagaataar glucose or neembu pani uplabdh karaayaa jaataa he, taaki koi biimaar naa pade
 Duty is changed every two hours to protect against heat
 saath hi gasht ke liye oont ke bajaay desert scooter kaa upyog kiya jaataa he taaki javaanon ke saath hi uunton ko bhi kuch raahat mil sake
 Black glasses on the eyes protect against heat and wrap the water bottle in the sack so that the water remains cool
 jawan yahaan garmi se bachane ke liye sir par topi or coton kaa fatka baandhakar rakhata he
 The 'cool Jacket', which has been tried many times to escape the heat, makes the duty of BSF jawans in the hot sands of Rajasthan very difficult
 pichley kai saalon main kai nijee companiyaan yahaan tak ki diardio ne bhi sharir ko garmi se bachaane ke liye kool jacket banaakar BSF ke javaanon ke saath kai baar test kiya
 But this cool jacket was not completely set on BSF personnel
 kyonki qamar ke upar jab bhi is kool jacket ko javaanon ko pahanaaya jaataa to upar kaa hissaa kool jacket kii vajah se kaaphi thanda ho jaataa
 The rest of the parts remain warm, so that the feeling of cold and hot is felt on different parts of the body
 isliye shuruaati daur main kool jacket kii testing to retile ilaakon ke liye kii gai lekin isamen khaas safalataa nahin mili
 The specialty of these cool jackets is that it has 12 pockets
 inamen phej change material (pisiem) rasayan ke packet rakhe jate hai
 These PCM packets are helpful in keeping the body of the soldiers cool for about six hours
 iske baad in pisiem ko waapas deep fries main richarge ke liye rakhana hota he
 It can be used again after recharge
 in tamaam uljhan bhari takneekon kii vajah se kool jacket ko vah safalataa nahin mili
 This is the reason that now BSF personnel are being provided facilities by installing air condition observation posts in many areas of Jaisalmer
 isse unako garmiyon main sarhad par gast karne main kisi tareeke kii pareshaaniyon kaa saamana naa karnaa pade
 Many false charges leveled against us by our former allies
 Our commitment to the Agenda of Alliance, co-authored by Ram Madhav & endorsed by senior leaders like Rajnath Ji never wavered
 It is sad to see them disown their own initiative & label it a 'soft approach
 ' 1 / 6status quo on Article 370, dialogue with Pakistan & Hurriyat were a part of aoa
 Encouraging dialogue, withdrawing cases against stonepelters & the unilateral ceasefire were much needed measures to restore confidence on the ground
 This was recognized & endorsed by BJP
 2 / 6not handing over the Rasana rape & murder case to CBI, getting the pro rapist ministers removed & also issuing orders not to harass the Gujjar & Bakarwal community in the guise of anti encroachment drives were my duties as CM to provide a sense of security to both communities
 5 / 6after expressing concern about freedom of expression in J&K following Shujaat's murder, their MLA, notorious & even punished for his role in the aftermath of the unfortunate Kathua case still threatens journalists belonging to the valley,so what are they going to do about him?6 / 6 The political uproar over the anti-country slogans in JNU is increasing
 jantar-mantar se lekar india get or uniwarsity campus main pradarshan kaa daur jari he, vahiin ab yah chingaari rashtriya rajdhani sthit sipiem ke karyaalay tak pahunch gai he

 Not only this, the protesters also put a blackboard on board outside the party office

 com / jsmmstkjsi— Sitaram Yechury (@sitaramyechury)february 14, 2016 US President Barack Obama told me in an e-mail interview for India Today just before his visit to India in January this year that for his country and India, stars are now making such a coincidence that they establish strategic relations which Till now, we have been running intermittently
 bharat main spasht bahumat ke saath narendra modi ke udai se tasviir main naatakeey badlaav aayaa
 The right-wing trend was established in public opinion by bypassing the left-liberal reluctance of the Congress Party, effectively forcing the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to expand military relations with the US due to the infamous "antony veto"
 
 us panne ko ab palata ja chukaa he
 Further evidence of this was recently seen as a brief visit by US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter
 unhone pashchim asia main islamic state of iraq and levaant (iesaiel) se, dakshin china samudr main china kii bhadakaau gatividhiyon se, afghanistan main lagaataar hote patan se or gharelu morche par chunaav se pehle ke saal kii dhruvikrut bahason se nibatane kii apni tamaan vyasttaaon ke bich na sirf bharat kii yatra kaa samay nikaala balki spasht samrik sandesh dete hue yatra kii shuruyaat bhartiya nausena kii purvi kaman ke garh vishakhapatnam se kii
 In an exclusive interview with Contributing Editor Shekhar Gupta, he acknowledged the importance of embarking on a voyage from Visakhapatnam, but also said, "yes, in a sense it is India's Look East policy and America's asia-pacific and Indian Ocean An attempt to establish a rebalancing is a confession
 ham donon hi samadri takat hai
 Unusually, a graduate in both physics and medieval history from Yale and a phd in nuclear physics from Oxford, Carter has also taught international relations and security subjects at Harvard and MIT
 carter kai ahm kitaaben likh or adhyayan kar chuke hai&jinamein ek 1987 main reagan kii samrik suraksha pahal ko chunauti dene vaali thi, or “catastrophic terarysm” par shandaar parchaa unhone tatkaaleen siie nideshak jon dush ke saath milakar likhaa tha
 Internationally, he is considered a stalwart of strategic policy
 dush kaa zikr aate hi ve majaak karte hai ki, “vah parchaa puri tarah upekshit kar diya jane vaala sabase durandeshi parchaa tha”, khaas taur par yah dekhte hue ki uske teen hi saal baad 9 / 11 kii ghatana ho gai
 Excerpts from the conversation: Your country is preparing for elections
 aise main america ko kis tarah kii videsh niti kii jarurat he? jo nai dharna banati dikhaai de rahi he, usamen yah mahasoos kiya ja rahaa he ki america ko america mulyon kaa niryaat nahin karnaa chahie or apane hiton kii raksha kerani chahie
 Is this a sign to see for yourself? i believe that America has a long tradition of protecting its interests in the long run, so they cannot be completely separated from the values it promotes , And we always consider these two to be related to each other
 iskaa 9 / 11 ke baad kii dharanaon se mail kaise hota he? pentagon america sarkaar kaa vaicharik hissaa he or uske liye sari duniya dost yaa dushman main banty hui he?mujhe nahin lagata
 Every day in the Defense Department, we are exposed daily to the reality that everything in the world is not black or white and is very complex and mixed
 yah vah cheez he jo aap sabase pehle sikhte hai jab aap duniyabar main us tarah uljhe hote hai, jaise america ulajhaa he, ki chijen aam taur par sahaj, kaali-safed nahin hotin
 Now there are some things that are just plain bad and you have to deal with them: ISIL, weapons of massacre in the hands of terrorists, cyber attacks being carried out to demolish structures or influence innocent people, terrorism because its target would be innocent people Huh
 ye baaten kaali yaa safed, galat yaa sahi, acchhee or buree kii shrenee main aa sakati hai
 But countries, people, regions cannot be divided in this way
 ab jabase hamane bigadi baat sudhaarney kaa daur shuru kiya he tab se ham koshish karte hai ki kisi ahm america se baatcheet main pakistan kaa zikr na chheden
 But as an Indian journalist, it is very difficult for me not to mention lashkar-e-taiba after such a long conversation, because people like me believe that Pakistan still has terrorists in its backyard or in its sleeve There is a different view of hidden snakes, which can bite him, and different about snakes in the courtyard, which he believes are under his control
 Not
 main vahiin se shuruyaat karata hum jahaan se aapane kii thi, yani ham baantate nahin hai
 The US stopped doing this long ago
 baharhaal, lashkar par aapke sawaal ke jawaab main hamaara maananaa yah he ki aatankwaad ke har swaroop kaa hamen virodh karnaa hoga
 Now whatever excuse is given for him, whatever reasons they have, America always opposes Lashkar
 pakistan ne paryaapt kaam kiya he?ham lagaataar pakistan ko is baat ke liye prerit karte rahe hai ki vah or kadam uthaae or kaha jaae to pakistan ne zyada kiya bhi he
 i think that finally some people in Pakistan have started realizing that the terrible danger which exists for Pakistan itself in sponsoring or engaging in terrorism or not combating it aggressively is the same
 There is a bigger reason than inspiration
 jis anya khaas udhaaharan kaa zikr aap kar rahe hai, use karnaa meri jimmedaari to nahin, lekin meraa sochna he ki videsh mantri jon kerri or yahaan hamaare duutavas ke adhikari is bare main bahut spasht hai ki ham lashkar ko lekar nyaayik prakriya ke bare main kitne chintit hai
 You said, "something" in Pakistan
 ” kya aapke moolyankan main is tarah ke logon kii sankhya paryaapt he, or vahaan ke faislon main ahm he jo apane aasteen ke sanpon ko saamne ke angan ke sanpon se alag aankane kii vyarthta ko mahasoos kar rahe hai?meri samaj main yah meraa moolyankan jo main spasht karnaa chaah rahaa tha
 That terrorism is causing trouble for themselves
 ab aise main, kya pakistan samet koi bhi desh vah sab kuch kar rahaa he jo ham use aatankwaad ke khilaaf karte dekhnaa chaahate hai? nahin, ham or kadam chaahate hai, lekin ve pehle kii tulana main to zyada kar hi rahe hai or ham unhen usee disha main badane ke liye protsaahit kar rahe hai
 When you open your eyes in the morning, how do you look at the state of the world strategically? Strategically for all of us (I believe that in today's world we are all global forces) the need is that we Develop a vision in which we can deal with different types of security challenges simultaneously
 masalan, iesaiel
 
 
 There is also Russia and Ukraine, then China
 ukraine main rus kaa vyavhaar thik un pracheen samay jaisaa he jab desh sidhe kisi padosi par hamalaa bol dete the, isiilie ham iske sakht virdohi hai
 The situation in China is very different
 uske bare main hamaara rukh yahi he ki ham china ko shantipurna tareeke se tarakkee karte dekhnaa chaahate hai
 What about the air safety zones and airspace complexities that we now see in China, South China Sagara? What has been noticed in the South China Sea in the last nearly one year is the speed and scale of the Chinese claim
 
 
 kya bharat ke paas chintaa kii vajahen hai?america kii hi tarah, bharat bhi apane vyapaar, apni suraksha ke liye nauvahan par kaaphi nirbhar karata he
 The issue here is not about any immediate neighborhood of India, but India is a maritime force and depends on traffic and trade through the South China Sea
 yatra kii shuruyaat vishakhapatnam se karne kii koi ahmiyat he jo hamaare purvi nausainik kaman kaa mukhyalay he?haa, is sandarbh main ki yah bharat or america, donon ke liye samudri suraksha kii ahmiyat ko ingit karti he
 It reflects the fact that India's "act East" policy in the maritime region and America's policy of rebalancing in the Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean regions are merged into the sea
 aapako obama prashasan main bharat kaa sabase acha mitra bhi mana jaataa he
 Thank you, but let me make it clear that President Obama himself is the best friend of India in the Obama administration, which is also evident from his meeting with PM Modi

 This is the message given by BJP President Amit Shah to Warroom in Patna on September 15, just before the announcement of the first list of its candidates for the Bihar Assembly elections
 isi aakraamak ranneeti ke saath bijepi ne ab argedy-jedy (you)-congress mahagathbandhan ke ummidavaaron kii suchi kaa intjaar kiye bina apane saamaajik akalan ke aadhaar par charanwar ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa elaan karnaa shuru kar diya he
 In the face of thorns, the party now wants to do the atmosphere in its favor with a "go ahead" strategy to attract voters who can see the wind at the last moment
 ab tak sadhi hui ranneeti apana rahi bijepi kii aakraamakata kii vajah uski jamini taiyaari he
 It had started in January itself, but it was given direction by Shah on April 14 in Patna activist conference
 shah ne tab khaas ranneetikaron ke saath baithak main kaha tha, “loksabhaa chunaav main bihar ke 62,779 boothon main se 9,302 boothon par mahaj 50 voton ke antar se faisla hua tha
 So we have to put all our energy at the booth
 agar ham booth jeetenge to chunaav jeetenge
 We have to worry about raising at least 100 votes at each booth
 ” yani shah formule ke hisaab se 36 vidhansabha siton par 50 voton kaa antar party kii is pratishtha kii ladaai main nirnaayak sabit ho saktaa he
 Booth Jeeto, Shah, considered a master of micromanagement management in Bihar, has adopted the same formula that Narendra Modi adopted before becoming Prime Minister
 shaharon kii bajaae gaanvon main party ke paksh main maahaul banane kii ranneeti banaai gai
 In the management, the BJP first formed a booth committee, in which 14 people, including the convener, were also selected, who are also voters of the same booth
 is tarah party ne har vidhansabha kshetra main 27,800 logon kii aisi fouj khadi kar lee, jo sidhe patna ke frager road sthit warroom se jud chuke hai
 Rituraj Sinha, the young entrepreneur associated with the party, has equipped this warroom with modern techniques so that there is no scope for any disturbance anywhere
 is warroom ke bare main sinha india today se kehete hai, “bihar main jab virdohi gathbandhan shaharon main hordings-poster lagane main vyast tha, tab ham gaanv kii ore nikal chuke the
 The future of Bihar will decide the village
 hamane har booth se sadasyon kaa aankada ikattha kar use vargeekrut kar liya he
 Booth committees have been formed
 ” booth kaaryakartaaon ko sangathit kar urja kaa sanchaar karne kii ranneeti kaa zikr karte hue ve kehete hai, “hamaare sabhi 245 parivartan rath atyaadhunik takanic se las hai or ham kahin bhi baithkar apane mobile se vahaan kii photo, bhaashan, bheed vagairah ko dekh sakate hai
 Through the booth-level cadres, the party has progressed strategically in writing slogans on walls, doors of houses, stickers on vehicles, flags on roofs
 party kaa maananaa he ki jo vyakti apni sahmati se jhande, stikar or deevaaron-daravaajon par bijepi kii prachaar saamagree lagavaayega, vah khulkar party kaa samarthak hoga
 But it is also a matter of concern for the BJP that the warroom from which it is executing its strategy is also caught in a mutual tussle
 ruturaj sinha, jinhen amit shah kaa varadahast hasil he, patna ke frager road se warroom sanchalit kar rahe hai
 His work is related to booth management and Parivartan Rath, while another Warroom is run by the party office in-charge General Secretary Bhupendra Yadav, who is overseeing the Parivartan Yatra and other arrangements with poster-hoardings etc
 sutron ke mutabik, bataur prabharee bhupendra ek hi warroom ke himachati the
 However, apart from this tussle, the BJP has kept in mind the intricate aspects of making a full army of committed workers
 party ne parivartan rath ko sabhi vidhansabha kshetron main bhejkar booth kaaryakartaaon ko sangathit kiya
 In this chariot, there is a team of Narendra Modi's speech, street theater through video
 is rath kii nigaraanee jeepies ke jariye hoti he or kis ilaake main is rath ko kitni tavajjo mil rahi he, isaki bhi sidhi nigaraanee warroom se hoti he
 With this chariot, the party started the Parivartan Yatra, in which all the senior leaders of the party had to go to all the assembly seats and hold meetings
 iske baad party ne parivartan raily kaa khaakaa banaaya or pradhanmantri narendra modi kii chaar badi raily karai
 With this four-stage campaign, the party tried to convey the message of change in Bihar through media, social media
 sabhi booth samitiyon ko whatsap group se joda gaya he or pal-pal kii khabar warroom ke jariye kendriya netritv tak pahunch rahi he
 Apart from this, a daily report is prepared by compiling the talk of himself and his opponent in the TV debate
 bijepi ke ek varisht ranneetikaar bataate hai, “shah aankadon par aadhaarit sahi report par hi koi baatcheet karte hai
 They even monitor the news published daily in the media, which newspaper gave so much space, who printed the BJP news with photos
 ”din main do baar akhabaari-tivi samachar sankalit kiye jate hai
 In the TV debate, the statements made by himself and his opponents are also reviewed
 iske alaava party kii ranneeti centre sarkaar kii beemaa yojanaon ko vot kaa saadhan banane kii bhi he
 a strategist explains, “we have distributed insurance scheme to 20 thousand people in every assembly
 ek parivaar main chaar voter ke hisaab se hamaare 80 hajaar vot tay samajhie
 If 60 percent of the votes are cast in an assembly, then the votes will be between one and a half lakh
 isamen se kuch vot nirdaleey le jaaenge or bijepi kii jeet kaa antar 50-60 hajaar ho saktaa he
 “BJP has made Jitau the only scale in the selection of candidates
 party ke liye yah chunaav kitna pratishtha kaa sawaal he, use ummidavaar chunaav kii ranneeti se bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 Shah and the Sangh have already formed a panel of candidates at their level, Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself has prepared the report through intelligence
 saamaajik sameekaran par nigahargedy-jedy (you)-congress mahagathbandhan se pehle hi bijepi ne saamaajik sameekaran kaa tanabana bunana shuru kar diya tha
 BJP leaders believe that at the time of speculation about the merger of Janata Parivar, the party had assumed that its opponents were now coming on a platform
 lihaaja, party ne 23 janvari ko karpuri thakur jayanti ke maukey par patna main raily kii, jisamen shah khud maujuud the
 Former Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur was a leader of the most backward and the number of voters in this society is close to 30 percent
 isliye bijepi ne bihar ke sabhi 38 jilon main ati pichhadaa manch banaakar bhi unki jayanti ko jor-shor se manaaya
 Before running Parivartan Rath across Bihar, the party took special note of the social equation
 is rath par 12 samaaj ke chehron ko jagah dekar bijepi ne savarnon kii party vaali chhavi se baahar nikalne kii bharsak koshish kii he
 However, the party says that it should not be seen in terms of social equations
 rathon par modi-shah ke alaava vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa nand kishor yadav, vidhaan parishad main netaa susheel kumaar modi, pradesh adhyaksh mangal pandey, teenon gathbandhan ke netaa, bihar se jude kendriya mantri, purv pradesh adhyaksh or rashtriya padaadhikariyon kii tasviren lagaai gai hai
 There is no mistake in the management, so he has collected the report of social equations of all 243 assemblies through the workers
 koun-sa samaaj bijepi ke paksh main he or koun virodh main, uski sthiti kaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Then a panel of 10–11 names of potential candidates of Apna, Opposition and allies has been taken from the Mandal level
 bihar ke prabharee mahasachiv bhupendra yadav kehete hai, “hamane apni report jameen par kaam karne vaale kaaryakartaaon se hasil kii he
 Bihar is now on the path of change which will lead all sections on the path of joint development
 ”micromanagement kii jarurat kyon?lekin is micromanagement ke baavjood bijepi ko raah aasaan nahin dikh rahi
 The BJP, which won a landslide victory in bihar-up in the Modi wave, was troubled by the nitish-lalu alliance, which was earlier supported by SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav
 loksabhaa chunaav ke sameekaran ke lihaaj se is gathbandhan ko badhat dikh rahi thi
 According to sources, in the initial assessment at the top level in BJP, it emerged that there is no wave like Lok Sabha elections, but there is an attraction towards Narendra Modi
 sutron kii maane to bijepi kaa khud kaa maananaa tha ki jo junun loksabhaa chunaav ke vakt modi ke liye kaaryakartaaon main tha, vaisaa ab nahin he, bhale vah vot bijepi ko de
 Says a senior party leader, “our Lok Sabha worker brought 10-12 voters to the booth
 ab vahi junun yadav samaaj main lalu yadav ke liye he kyonki unhen 10 saal baad phir apni takat waapas aati dikh rahi he
 The Kurmi society also cannot digest the insults of its leader Nitish Kumar in the Lok Sabha
 muslim vot ke bantane kaa bhi koi kaaran nahin he
 That is, our fight is to bring a split in these votes
 ”shuru main isi akalan ke baad bijepi ne micromanagement kii ranneeti par focus kiya
 The inclusion of former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi shaped the social equation
 vaise gathbandhan main siton ko lekar machi khinchataan ne bijepi alaakaman kii peshaani par bal daal die hai
 Due to the distribution of tickets, rebels are starting to erupt in the bjp's camp with its allies
 haalanki bijepi ko sapa-ensipi, pappu yadav kii party or asaduddin auwaisi kii party ke maidan main utarane se mahagathbandhan ke voton ke bikharaav se laabh kii ummid he
 The feedback from the Sangh raised concerns that due to the coordination of seats, BJP has shifted its strategy towards aggressive campaigning
 lekin is ranneeti ke peeche kii badi vajah sangh parivaar se party ko diya gaya feedback he
 According to sources, the Sangh, through its volunteers, got the team swapped for 28 weeks and conducted the survey, in which at one time the NDA position was reduced to half of the existing seats in the assembly
 sangh ne baad main jo feedback diya he, vah bhi utsahvardhak nahin he kyonki usamen endie gathbandhan do ankon se aage badaae ke liye hi jaddojahad karata dikh rahaa he
 Recently, after the conclusion of the Sangh Parivar's coordination meeting held at Madhyanchal in Delhi on 2-4 September, the Sangh leaders including Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat held "free thinking" with National Cooperation Minister Saudan Singh, who is working in Bihar
 is report ke baad party ne aakraamak abhiyaan par focus kiya taaki chunavi phija bhagavamay ho jaae
 The caste equation that emerged from the nitish-lalu alliance has also increased bjp's difficulties because 14 of the booth-level workers on whom the BJP is betting have found people who were also in touch with the anti-coalition
 unhen baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya he
 bjp's morale is high with the historic victory in the Lok Sabha elections
 vah is koshish main he ki chunaav kisi bhi tarah se jaat-paant main na uljhe
 With the face of Narendra Modi in focus, the party does not want to leave any stone unturned to win the election
 isliye ranneeti or warroom par shah khud paini najar gadaaye hai

 If you are an adult, Grand Masti is great for you in two respects: first for entertainment and second for funny sex education
 film main aapako bataaya jaataa he ki sex kii bhashaa main e for kya hota he or bi for kya hota he
 
 
 And what happens to f
 aapako kuch muhaavaron kaa nae sandarbh main istemaal bhi najar aayega, jaise naam bade or darshan chote
 You will also understand how to play a ticking horse
 aap yah bhi samaj jaaenge ki kisi college kii short form slots bhi ho sakati he
 Grand Masti comes true to the test of the kind of adult comedy that Indra Kumar and Kayanat Arora talked about in a few days ago
 film bold vijuals or non veg jokes kaa behtareen collection he, kuch spaces chhod den to kahin bhi uktaahat mahasoos nahin hoti he
 Hot trio (bruna, Maryam, Kayanat) are the life of the film
 beshak film main kuch seen agnipath, no entry yaa phir kai angreji filmon se liye gaye hai, lekin unako diya gaya nayaa treetment is baat ko bilkul bhi chubhane nahin detaa he
 There is no need to pay much attention to the story, seeing the fun of the story
 teen pati hai, apni biji biviyon se bor hai or college reunion ke liye college pahunchate hai
 Then they start preparing for their grand fun
 yaheen unki mulaakaat teen pataakhaa ladakiyon roj, meri, marlo se hoti he
 Then begins, the result of husbands' sex appetite
 film main kuch aisa nahin he jo apratyaashit ho lekin mjedaar dialog or actors ke haav-bhav khub gudgudate hai
 The timing has always been tremendous in the comedy of Star Appellitesh Deshmukh
 film main unhen dekhnaa vaaki mjedaar he
 Aftab Shivdasani has done a good job
 haalanki vivek oberoi bhi in donon ke bich khap jate hai
 Sonali Kulkarni, Karisma Tanna and Manjari Phadnis are in the role of Sharif Biwi
 asli kahar barapaaya he roj (marayam jakaaria), meri (bruna abdulla) or marlo (kaaynaat aroda) ne
 Their sexy style ejects cold sighs and the one liners are also a blast
 is tarah kii hot tikdi vaaki dhamal he
 The film repeatedly looks for these three
 haalanki roj meri marlo kaa concept 2001 kii hit film style se liya gaya he
 The budget of Grand Masti has been kept very limited by Indra Kumar
 haalanki punjab, haryana or chandigarh main film ke relies na hone se iske bijness par asar pad saktaa he, lekin kam bajet film hone kii vajah se film ko laagat nikaalane main zyada mushkil aegi nahin
 Anyway, if the film has got a certificate, then the audience category is limited to a great extent anyway
 agar is weekend kuch khaas nahin he or aap edlt hai to yah film aapke liye hi he or paisa vasuul he
