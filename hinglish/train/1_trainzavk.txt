 kashmir main kathith rup se samvidhan or loktantr kii hatya ke aarope ke sandarbh main rajyapal apana paksh rakh rahe the magar isi prakriya main ve loktantr kaa vistaar bhi kar rahe the
 Creating a new scale
 janata ke bich jawaab de rahe the
 If he wanted to use his position of office, he could speak directly about me upside down, but did not do so at all even when i had de-railed him
 rajyapal satyapal malik bhi achaanak aae is imtahaan main shandaar numberon se paas ho gaye
 His speech was over
 apni kursi kii taraf aane lage to main apni kursi se uthaa
 He extended his hand and i took mine
 ham donon ne haath milaayaa
 There was neither anger nor embarrassment in my eyes
 ve rajyapal vaali apni oonchi kursi par baith gaye
 After the national anthem, when he got up to leave, he came towards me and started telling some things
 us kshan main bhi ve mujh se bharosa maang rahe the or main bharosa na todane kaa vaada kar rahaa tha
 He trusted me and told me things
 maine kaha ki lekin jo aapane bhaashan diya he uski ricarding dilli bhej di he
 i just wanted to let you know before i drive
 unhone kaha jo on ricard kaha he wo on ricard he
 We both started laughing
 peeche khadey unke edisi kii hansi chhot gai
 Perhaps he too would not have thought that this could happen in a democracy
 iske baad ham log ramashankar singh ke ghar pahunche
 The Governor was eating food on one table in his lawn and on the other end i came and sat down
 aas-paas ke log sahame dekh rahe the ki yahaan phir aamane-saamne hai
 i got busy fixing the place of lentils and rotis in the thali to make a good place for the fish
 tabhi rajyapal satyapal malik apni kursi se uthakar mere bagal main aa gaye
 Someone put a chair next to me and the governor sat close to me
 unhone bahut kuch bataaya ki kashmir ke yuvaaon ke liye kya kya kar rahe hai
 i said that there is no university in Ladakh
 chaatr bahut pareshaan hai
 Satyapal Malik said that i know and i am doing something
 kuch baaten or bhi huin jinka yahaan bataane kaa matlab nahin he
 After this, Governor Malik got up with permission that i have to go because my helicopter will not be able to land when it gets dark
 yah loktantr kaa sabase rachanaatmak kshan tha
 At the ITM University, there may be a dispute over what the Governor said about Kashmir
 us par meri koi thos raay nahin he kyonki main kashmir kaa jaankaar nahin hum
 But his behavior during that time is one of the memorable moments in my life
 shaayad yah rajyapal satyapal malik ke jivan kaa bhi shandaar lamhaa rahaa hoga
 India's democracy needs more such magnificent moments
 jis tarah se saamne sawaal karne kii parampara khatm hoti ja rahi he, uske liye zaruri he ki is spes ko phir se hasil kiya jaae
 The comments maine yah sab isliye likhaa taaki aap behatar tareeke se jaj kar saken ki loktantr ke spes ko hasil karne kaa yah tarika kitna sahi tha or donon ne is imtahaan ko kaise paas kiya
 There is an atmosphere of fear in Fiza
 pucho mat naukari chali jaaegi
 Don't ask, abusers will come on Twitter
 ham donon hi is dabaav se mukt the
 When you know both things, then only you will be able to judge properly who has got the benefit of what happened that day
 loktantr ke maahaul ko mila he yaa phir kisi ek vyakti ko
 If i did not write all these things, i would have disrespected their behavior at that time and you would have known only one side of my video which was going viral
 rajyapal ne mere sawaal poochne ke adhikaar or bolne ke swabhaav kii saraahna kii
 Invited me to come to Kashmir
 in sabake liye rajyapal satyapal malik kaa shukriya
 Now the Governor gets up from the chair to give a speech
 meri baat kaa asar unke dimaag par ho chukaa tha
 They too had less time to decide whether to reply to me or to say what they had prepared
 aam taur par rajyapal dikshant samarohon main aupchaarik kism kaa bhaashan dete hai
 a student leader from Satyapal Malik during his youth awoke
 unke baton main halkaa sa gussa dikhaa lekin unhone meraa zaraa bhi apmaan nahin kiya
 The language was not broken
 ve meraa naam lekar baat kehane lage
 He turned and looked at me
 bataane lage ki kyon yah faisla kiya
 The fax machine is not the whole thing
 satyapal malik ne kaha bhi ki raveesh bhai aapane fax mashin kii baat kah mujhe direl kar diya yani patari se utaar diya
 i was now recording his words
 main ek rajyapal ko apni hi baat kii pratikriya main camere ke peeche se dekh rahaa tha
 The governor did not leave anyone with an answer
 na kashmir ke netaaon ko na hi dilli kii sarkaar ko or na hi kashmir ko badnaam karne vaale dilli media ko

 After this we reached the house of Ramashankar Singh
 unke lon main ek mez par ek taraf rajyapal khaanaa kha rahe the or duusari chor par main aakar baith gaya
 The people around were suddenly seeing that here again they were face to face
 main thali main daal or roti kii jagah tay karne main vyast ho gaya taaki machhlee ke liye thik-thaak jagah ban sake
 Then Governor Satyapal Malik got up from his chair and came next to me
 kisi ne bagal main kursi rakhi or rajyapal mere kareeb baith gaye
 He talked a lot about what he is doing for the youth of Kashmir
 maine kaha ki ladakh main uniwarsity nahin he
 Students are very upset
 satyapal malik ne kaha ki mujhe pataa he or main kuch kar rahaa hum
 There have been some other things that are not meant to be mentioned here
 iske baad rajyapal malik ijazat lekar uthe ki mujhe janaa padegaa kyonki andhera ho jane par meraa helicopter land nahin kar paaegaa
 This was the most constructive moment of democracy
 ai tii em uniwarsity main rajyapal ne kashmir ko lekar jo kaha use lekar vivaad ho saktaa he
 i have no firm opinion on that because i am not a Kashmiri
 lekin us dauraan jo unka vyavhaar tha vah mere jivan ke yaadgaar kshanon main se ek he
 Perhaps it must have been a wonderful moment in the life of Governor Satyapal Malik
 bharat ke loktantr ko aise or shandaar lamhon kii zarurat he
 The way the questioning question is getting over, it is important that this space is regained
 tippaniyan i wrote all this so that you can better judge how right this method of gaining the space of democracy was and how both passed this examination
 phiza main dar kaa maahaul he
 Don't ask, the job will go away
 pucho mat twitor par gaali dene vaale aa jaaenge
 We were both free from this pressure
 jab aap donon baaten janenge tabhi aap sahi tarah se jaj kar paaenge ki us din jo hua uskaa laabh kise mila he
 The atmosphere of democracy has got either one person or another
 main yah sari baaten nahin likhata to unke us vakt ke vyavhaar ke saath anadar ho jaataa or aap viral ho rahe mere video se sirf ek hi paksh ko jaan pate
 The Governor appreciated my right to ask questions and my nature of speaking
 mujhe kashmir aane kaa nyauta diya
 Thanks to Governor Satyapal Malik for all this

 com / qfxpbaawyt yah hakeekat he, lekin kisi filmi kahani se kam nahin
 a youth named Anand Gupta, who went missing from Datia last year, recently returned home
 uske parijanon kii khushi kaa to thikaana nahin rahaa lekin anand ke lautne ke saath hi shivpuri ke gualia gaanv ke soni khangaar ke ghaav phir hare ho gaye
 Khangar's 20-year-old son Netram was taken into custody by the police as an accused of kidnapping Anand and died in custody
 uskaa shav ped se lataka mila tha
 When the case was judicially investigated, it was found that Netram did not commit suicide but died due to police harassment
 idhar, ghar laute anand ne police ko bataaya ki uske apraharan main netaram yaa uske parivaar kaa haath nahin tha
 The story begins on March 5, 2013, when Rakesh Gupta of Udguwan village lodged a report of son Anand's disappearance
 police kii shaq kii sui shivpuri jile ke gualia gaanv ke gopal khangaar kii ore thi
 According to the investigation report, when the police did not touch Gopal, she picked up her brother Netram and brought him to the Uddagu police station
 yahaan police ne netaram ko kareeb nau din tak avaidh rup se hiraasat main rakhaa
 He was beaten up badly
 pratadia ke chalate netaram ne dam tod diya

 Netram's body hanged on a tree in the field to name the murder a suicide along with Dodhi
 postmortem report main bhi ise aatmahatya kaa maamla bataaya gaya
 (the wretched parents of Netaram, who were killed in police custody) Netram's father Soni Khangar was not sure that his son could commit suicide
 isliye unhone maamle kii nyaayik jaanch kii maang kii, jisamen sabit ho gaya ki netaram kii maut police ke torchar se hui he
 It was also learned that the postmortem report was also prepared under police pressure

 nyaayik jaanch puri hue paanch maah biit chuke hai
 But with the intention of getting the case stuck, the police department has recommended a CID investigation
 isi bich 2 april ko anand ghar laut aayaa
 Superintendent of Police of Datia R
 pi
 Singh says, "anand has denied involvement in the kidnapping of Netram or his family
" mritak netaram bekasoor tha
 However, they refrain from taking action against their officers under the guise of a CID investigation
 idhar, apane bekasoor bete ko kho chuke khangaar ab bhi dehshat main hai
 He says, "the police is threatening us and all the witnesses who gave statements in judicial inquiry
 ’’anand ke laut aane or uski ore se netaram ko clin chit die jane se ab datia police sawaalon ke ghere main aa gai he
 He is not being made to answer why the innocent Natram was kept in custody and why he was being confessed to the crime, which he never did
 police mahakama ab bhi apane aaropee adhikariyon ko bachaane kii firaaq main he
 "after judicial investigation, the police department has registered a case against the four policemen and the three doctors," a CID official said on condition of anonymity
 lekin police kii siidi jaanch is baat ko dhyaan main rakhkar ho rahi he ki police ne netaram se andeh ke aadhaar par poochtacha kii thi
 It is also being investigated whether Netram's health was not bad before being taken into custody? In such a case, the CID investigation should turn this matter into non-willful murder instead of murder
 to koi aashcharya nahin hona chahie

 Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, the emphasis is on building toilets in every household, especially in rural areas, so that there is no need to go for open defecation

 Moving from real life to real life, good news has come out from Gonda in UP

 bataa den ki bharat main in bimariyon se har saal kareeb 28 lakh logon kii maut ho jaati he

 unhone pehle research kii, jisamen pataa chalaa ki aamtaur par istemaal kiye ja rahe stenescope (fefdon kii aawaaj sunne vaala yantra) main kai tarah kii kamiyaan hai
 Then with the help of a doctor, Dr
 Nambiraj Konar, Adarsh K, Tapas Pandey created a better stethoscope, which is much better than treatment and can also be used by the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) in the villages as well
 yah ek digital stenescope he, jo fefdon kii aawaaj or dil kii dhadkan sunne ke saath yah isaki audio clip bhi bana letaa he
 According to a research done by Adarsh, it is very helpful in a country like India, where there is a doctor on 1700 people
 UPSC: is ladki ne sabase kam umr main paas kii civil sarvice parikshasath hi yah aadhunik stenescope skip se conect ho saktaa he or record kiye gaye audio ko skip ke tarah bhej sakate hai
 Regarding this innovation, Adarsh told Forbes that with this an ASHA worker can also record the patient's voice and heartbeat from anywhere in the rural areas and send it to his doctor
 saumya ko sunne main he dikkat, pariksha ke din tha bukhaar, ab baniin ias!khaas baat ye he ki isaki aawaaj saaf hoti he, jise aasaani se suna ja saktaa he
 Let us tell that all three also got first prize in MEDC for this innovation, after which they also got the opportunity to do many fellowships
 saath hi isaki keemat bhi yues dwaara banaae jane vaale stenescope se kam he or isaki quality usee ke baraabar he

 The Narendra Modi government made Article 370 ineffective under its historic decision
 grahamantri amit shah ne somvaar yani 5 agast ko rajyasabha ko bataaya ki sarkaar ne anuchhed 370 ke teen khandon main sirf 370 (1) ko chhodkar anya sabhi praavdhaanon ko khatm kar diya he
 With this, the privileges enjoyed by Jammu and Kashmir will now end
 sarkaar ne dhara 370 ko puri tarah khatm karne kii jagah sirf un praavdhaanon par kanchi chalaai, jiske jariye jammu-kashmir ko desh ke anya rajyon se kahin zyada adhikaar mili hue the
 Due to Article 370, laws other than defense, foreign and communications matters passed from Parliament could not apply directly there
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki bachaa hua aakhri praavdhaan yani 370 (1) bhi khatm ho saktaa he
 The reason is that the Supreme Court has taken cognizance of the petition filed by BJP leader and lawyer Ashni Upadhyay regarding Section 370
 jis par supreme court beete dinon grih mantralay or kanoon mantralay ko notice jari kar jawaab bhi maang chukaa he
 Petitioner Ashwini Upadhyay says that even if the government does not make Section 370 ineffective, the matter does not survive during the hearing in the Supreme Court
 magar sarkaar ne swaagatyogy or saahasik pahal karte hue dhara 370 ko beasar kar diya
 Even then 370 (1) still persists
 jiske chalate ab bhi jammu-kashmir kii sarkaar kii sahmati se hi raashtrapati jammu-kashmir main kanoonon ko lagu kar sakate hai
 Upadhyay says that he has such arguments to repeal 370 (1) as well, which the Supreme Court can agree on during the hearing
 upaadhyaay ke mutabik agar sarkaar samay se supreme court ke notice par apana jawaab daakhil kare to bachaa hua praavdhaan supreme court se bhi khatm ho saktaa he
 Therefore, there will be no need to ask the legislative assembly in Jammu and Kashmir to implement any law passed by the Parliament

 bataa den ki isse pehle uparajyapal ne kejariwal ko khat likhaa tha
 Highlights of Lt
 Governor Anil Baijal's letter - • The Lt
 Governor told the Chief Minister that no proposal has been received regarding the plan of CCTV Camel Singing in LG office
 • sisitivi camaron kii sthapana ke kaam se sambandhit prastaav keval nirvaachit sarkaar ke saath lambit he
 No instructions have been issued by this office to stop the proposal for CCTV work

 Why are you violating the constitution? • If the committees make laws, rules, policies and structures, what will the cabinet, parliament and assembly do? The chief minister has also mentioned in his letter the model running in NDMC areas
 1) camere kaa sthaan sthaneey ardblue, sthaneey police or camere kii sthapana karne vaali company dwaara tay kiya jaataa he
 2) The DVR is housed in a room provided by RWA
 3) fid endiemasi, ardblue or police ke liye uplabdh he
 Arvind Kejriwal has asked LG why such a model was rejected
 kejariwal ne aage alji ko bataaya ki wo sisitivi bani samiti ko asweekaar karte hai, kyonki ise baadha paidaa karne or ise bina kisi kanoonee aadhaar par banaaya gaya he
 Which are illegal and unconstitutional

 Life changes completely after marriage

 There is going to be a tough competition between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress in the elections to the two Rajya Sabha seats of Gujarat
 bijepi ke baad ab congress ne bhi rajyasabha chunaav main pratyaashiyon ko utaarne kaa faisla kiya he
 Today, two Congress candidates Gaurav Pandya and Chandrika Chudasama will file nomination
 bataa den, kendriya grahamantri amit shah or kendriya mantri smriti irani ne rajyasabha sadsyta se istipha diya tha
 By-elections are taking place after this
 chunaav ayog ne alag-alag seat ke liye alag-alag voting karne kaa aadesh diya he
 If the voting is different, BJP will win both seats
 chunaav ayog ke is faisle ke khilaaf congress supreme court pahunch gai he
 Hearing in this case can be held today or Tuesday
 agar ek hi ballat paper par voting hoti he to ek seat par bijepi or ek seat par congress jeet sakati he
 Let us tell you that there is a dispute over the election of the two Rajya Sabha seats of Gujarat on July 5
 rajya main congress ke netaa vipaksh pareshabhai dhanani ne donon siton par ek saath chunaav karaae jane par aapatti jataai or chunaav ayog ke faisle ke khilaaf supreme court pahunche the
 Now the court has approved their petition, this hearing is to be held
 darasal, gujarat congress ke netaa pareshabhai dhanani ne chunaav ayog kii adhisuchana ko chunauti di he
 BJP President Amit Shah and Union Minister Smriti Irani have been elected as Lok Sabha MP this time, so their seat is vacant on which election is to be held
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki ek hi din donon siton par alag-alag chunaav karana asanvaidhanik or samvidhan kii bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 According to the Election Commission notification, Amit Shah got the certificate of winning the Lok Sabha elections on 23 May, while Smriti got on 24 May
 isse donon ke chunaav main ek din kaa antar ho gaya, isi aadhaar par ayog ne rajya kii donon siton ko alag-alag mana he, lekin matdaan ek hi din hona he
 Congress argues that due to this, BJP will win both the seats because first preference votes will be decided afresh
 lekin ek saath chunaav hote to congress ko ek seat mil jaati
 Significantly, according to the number strength, the candidate needs 61 votes to win the Rajya Sabha election in Gujarat
 ek hi ballat par chunaav hone se ummidavaar ek hi vot daal paaegaa
 In this situation, the Congress could easily take a seat as it has 71 mlas

 The court asked the counsel for the group where these Rs 850 crore went

 ASG Pinki Anand, appearing for NBCC, said, 'we will need Rs 1000 crore to start the work

 The court also remarked that the builders make a lot of promises to the home buyer in the beginning, but the fact is that those promises are never fulfilled which makes the home buyer feel cheated

 gujarat ke patidaar netaa hardik patel kii sari sharton ko abhi tak congress ne nahin mana he, hardik ne pehle 3 november tak to ab 7 november tak kaa ultimate diya he
 Meanwhile, Hardik has now started knocking on the doors of other political parties
 ensipi netaa prafull patel ne buudhvaar ko hardik patel se mulaakaat kii
 Praful Patel is the same leader who during the Rajya Sabha elections in Gujarat recently called a NACP MLA to get votes in favor of BJP
 aise main hardik or prafull kii mulaakaat ke siyaasi myne talash kiye ja rahe hai
 The question is arising that Hardik is not trying to pressure Congress on this pretext? bjp's doors closed, in fact, Hardik Patel started reservation movement for Patidar community in 2015
 aarakshan andolan ke jariye apni pahchaan banane vaale hardik patel gujarat kii siyasat main turup kaa patta hai
 Due to this, all political parties are trying to vote for the Patidar community in their favor through Hardik
 aarakshan andolan ke chalate hardik or sattadhari bijepi aamane-saamne aa gai, yahi vajah he ki bijepi ke andar hardik ke liye saare daravaaje band hai
 In such a situation, Hardik is looking for a third house
 congress se nahin ho paa rahi dilkuch dinon pehle tak lag rahaa tha ki hardik congress kaa haath tham lenge, lekin ain vakt par unhone congress ko ultimatum de diya
 He granted the Congress first till November 3 in the matter of giving quota to the Patidar society
 baad main unhone kaha ki ve 7 november tak intjaar karenge
 The Congress has now kept silence on this
 isse mana ja rahaa ki unhone khud pair par kulhadi maar lee he
 After the Congress pulled out, Hardik did not have much choice in the election
 ensipi or hardikcongress se mol bhav chal hi rahi thi ki ensipi netaa prafull patel ne buudhvaar ko hardik patel se mulaakaat kii
 Since then, there has been speculation about Hardik going to NCP
 hardik patel bhale hi is mulaakaat ko chunavi chashme se nahin dekhne ke liye kah rahe hai, lekin jis vakt main yah mulaakaat ho rahi he, us vajah se yah kai myne main khaas he
 Tohardik, who is believed by political experts, is not trying to pressure Congress by meeting Praful Patel
 congress kii raah main braker to nahin ban rahe prafull?prafull patel ensipi ke vahi netaa he, jinhone pichley dinon gujarat ke rajyasabha chunaav ke dauraan enesipi vidhayak ko kol karke bijepi ke paksh main vot dilvaaya tha
 Political experts behind the meeting of Praful Patel and Hardik say that all this has been done to prevent them from going to Congress
 kyonki hardik kaa daaman thamte to nishchit rup se bada phayda gujarat main miltaa
 In such a situation, BJP has not used Prafulla as a breaker in the path of Hardik and Congress
 afghanistan ke jalalabad main rashtriya suraksha nideshaalay (endies) ke offis par ek aatmghaatee hamale main aath logon kii maut ho gai, jabaki 41 anya ghayal ho gaye
 The news agency Xinhua quoted the officer as saying, 'five people attacked the NDS office at five in the morning, after which the encounter took place
 'adhikari ne kaha, 'aatankwaadiyon ko parisar main daakhil karaane ke liye ek aatankwaadi ne visphotakon se bhare vaahan ko offis kii diwaar main takaraakar visphot kar diya
 'the encounter lasted till nine in the morning

 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's son Rehan was treated at LV Prasad Eye Institute here on Saturday

 a senior Congress leader in the city said that there was no publicity of Priyanka and her son coming and going
 ye unka nijee daura tha
 The Congress leader said that he arrived here in the morning and went back in the afternoon
 aspataal ke adhikariyon ne kaha, 'bachche kaa hamaare aspataal main ilaaj kiya gaya
 We cannot give more information than this
 shahar main congress ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha ki priyanka or unke bete ke yahaan aane or jane kaa kaarykram kaa koi prachaar prasar nahin kiya gaya tha
 This was his personal visit
 congress netaa ne kaha ki wo yahaan subah pahunche or dopaher main waapas chale gaye
 The Congress leader said that he arrived here in the morning and went back in the afternoon
 agle hafte bajet pesh hoga
 Its analysis will start immediately, but in view of the economic condition of the country, there are big challenges before the government this year, so it is expected that the budget will be complicated
 vishleshkon ko ise samajhane main bahut maathapai kerani pad sakati he
 However, a discussion of some of the budget tips before it is presented
 bajet se logon kii ummiido kaa maahaul nahin bana
 
 
 It is a trend that every section that expects for itself from the budget used to say its demand, but this time these voices demanding it were less heard
 yani sarkaar apni marji yaa subhite se jo tay karegi,use hi maananaa padegaa ki logon ke liye vahi zaruri he
 That is why budget analysts have to prepare beforehand what was more important to do in the budget in the current climate of the country and what work the government considered necessary
 jatil hota ja rahaa he bajet ko samajhnaa
 
 
 Whatever the government says, but what it does, it is known from the budget itself
 ab yah alag baat he ki idhar kuch saal se bajet pechida banane lage hai
 The amount written in the digits in the budget document should be more visible in the columns, but for some years, the words and the philosophy have started to be introduced more in the budget
 is baar vishleshkon ko or zyaada jatil dastavej kaa vishleshan karne ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 Mali condition pressure the most
 
 
 ham kehete kuch bhi rahen,lekin is samay apni mali haalat baari chintaa main daale he
 There was difficulty in achieving the target of economic growth
 bankshanfaaki samasya main fanse hai
 The debt burden on the government is increasing
 rojgaar or kaam-dhandhe kam hote ja rahe hai
 Farmers are becoming poor
 zaruri kaamon par kharch ke liye sarkaar ko paryaapt maatra main rajasav badhaane main dikkat aa rahi he
 In fact, the collection of tax, the account-rich and affluent people and the industry-trading section, remains angry
 haalanki loktantric bajet kaa makasad hi yahi he ki sarkaar sabko samaan str par laane kii koshish karti rahe
 Continue to take money from the rich and give it to the poor
 kya he sabase bada roda
 
 
 In fact, in order to maintain popularity, governments avoid tax revenue by increasing revenue from the accounts and drink sections
 haalanki chaar saal pehle ek jatke main tel,yani deazal-petrol par baari tex lagaakar sarkaar ne apana khazaana badhaane kaa intazaam kar liya tha
 That arrangement was also done because by the time the prices of crude oil fell in the world market to a quarter, so the government increased its revenue by increasing taxes on oil instead of giving it to consumers
 janata ko tel kii mahangaai se raahat nahin di thi
 Till date, this tax has remained so huge, that is why there is no scope to collect more money from this indirect tax
 khazaana or badhanaa kuch zyaada hi mushkil
 
 
 Just a few months ago, before the general elections, the tax limit for income tax relief to middle class was increased from 2
5 lakh to 5 lakh
 chunaav jeetne ke fouran baad ab sarkaar ke liye itani jaldi phir se inakam tex badhanaa jokhim kaa kaam he
 Similarly, in the election phase, many times the intention of reducing GST has been expressed on many things, so there is a problem in increasing revenue from GST
 itnaa hi nahin,pichley salmoghshthse rajasav kaa lakshya hasil hota nahin dikhataa
 So, in the new budget, a bigger target of revenue than GST cannot be made
 phir bhi kahin na kahin se sarkari khazaane main paisa laana hi padegaa
 According to the latest media reports, some money can be brought to the treasury by selling government factories and enterprise complexes, but during NDA-1 such efforts did not yield good results, the government was notorious
 sarkari kharch ghataane kii bhi gunjaaish nahin
 
 
 Some important items like education and health were ignored last year in the spiral of reducing government spending
 vah chunaav ke pehle vaala saal tha,so,adhikansh media main is nukte kaa dhang se vishleshan kiya nahin gaya
 In the analysis of last year's full budget, the media was surprisingly restrained, but this time the situation is different
 aam chunaav nipat gaye hai
 It will be interesting to see what the media's attitude is about the government this time
 vaade bhulaanaa bhi aasaan nahin
 
 
 The list of government's election promises is very long, it is a long task to be counted, but it is a rough estimate that in the next five years, the minimum cost of fulfilling these promises will be Rs 80 lakh crore
 yani sarkaar ko har saal alag se kam se kam15lakh karod kii zarurat he
 There is no scope to raise fifteen lakh crores in the treasury
 is saal ke bajet kaa aakaar paanch lakh karod se zyaada badhata nahin dikhataa
 The size of the budget is estimated to be in the wrap up of a maximum of thirty lakh crores
 gauratlab he ki pichley bajet kaa aakaar23lakh99hazaar karod,yani24lakh karod rupee kaa hi ban paaya tha
 Last year, the size of the budget was 21 lakh 46 thousand crore
 yani bajet aakaar dhai lakh karod hi bad paaya tha
 However, this time the revenue of the estimated five lakh crores is going to be dealt with by handling all the work
 isi thodi si rakam main se fouj ke liye videshi ladaaku vimaanon kii kharid or fouj ke duusare sazosaman khareednaa he,isi main se shiksha or swasthya ko zyaada dhan dena he
 In this, the new promise for new farmers to spend five lakh crore every year is to be fulfilled, 50 crore people in the country have to spend treatment up to five lakh rupees every year
 desh bhar main krishi upaj godaam or kisaan mandiyaan banani hai,desh ke har ghar main nal lagavaana he
 Apart from these, there are big schemes that generate employment
 sarkaar ne janata se bisiyon footkar vaade kar rakhe he,ve alag hai
 These are all such promises, which are not easy to erase from public memory
 adhure kaam bhi peechha nahin chodenge
 
 
 The previous phase of the government, that is, the term of NDA-1 may have ended, but a lot of work remains to be done during that period
 masalan,san2022tak sabko pakke makaan,kisaanon kii aay doguni karne ke liye unhen nai sahuliyatein,muft main gas silendar or shauchalay kaa kaam abhi puraa nahin hua he
 100 smart cities, water projects up to every farm, two crore jobs every year, grand highways in the country, tens of high-speed rail projects, water transport work in the river, high-cost work connecting rivers, world-class universities The work is in slowness due to money
 ames jaise kai chikitsa sansthaanon kaa kaam paison kii kami se sust padaa he
 These are all things that cannot be stopped or abandoned in any case
 chunaav ke ain pehle kisaan parivaar ko paanch sau rupee dene kii yojana ke liye har saal90,000karod kaa intazaam karnaa he
 Overall, this time, the government will have to show more skill to calculate the budget
 ghaataa uthaakar kharch badhaane kaa rasta band
 
 
 Too much deficit budget cannot be presented
 sarkaar ne yah karne ke liye khud ko vanchit kar rakhaa he
 When today's government used to be in opposition, it used to surround previous governments on this issue
 baharhaal,maujuuda sarkaar apane puraane tarkon ko metakar ghate ke bajet ke phaayde katai nahin gina sakati
 Way to reduce from one item to another
 
 
 vaise pichley bajaton main jo mad the,or unamem jitna kharch kiya gaya tha,use kam karnaa lagbhag asambhav kaam hota he
 Every system of the country is operating with minimum expenses
 yahi rasta bachaa dikhataa he ki chaturaai se ek mad kaa paisa ghataakar duusare main badha dikhaa diya jaae
 To do this the language in the budget document will need cleverness
 praathamiktaayen to banani hi padengi
 
 
 After all, our country is a country of two hundred lakh crore economy, so one or two new works can be announced to show
 kya hoga,or kitne kharch kaa hoga,atkal lagaana mushkil he,lekin animantrit suzav ke taur par yah charchaa zarur kii ja sakati he ki desh ke maujuuda halaat ke maddenzar is bajet kaa focus kis kaam par hona zaruri he
 Farming, farming, health, education, law and order and security at the border are always important for every country, but if we consider the current trend, then at this time the national security appears to be the top priority of the government
 yah mudda aisa he,jise koi bhi kam mahatv kaa nahin bataa saktaa,isiilie rashtrahit main raksha kharch jahaan kaa tahaan banaae rakhane,or agar gunjaaish nikal aae,to use badhaane ke asaar zyaada hai
 In the last two-three years, the need to buy equipment for the army has been proved successfully
 janata ke dilo-dimag main rashtriya asmita,rashtriya garv,rashtriya suraksha,rashtriya hit jaise naare is samay bhi gunj rahe hai,so,ek atkal lagaai ja sakati he
 The government can argue that the public will have to forget other needs in the national interest
 phir bhi kuch zaruuratein,jo chodi nahin ja saktin
 
 
 The solution to the major disasters that have come upon the nation at this time is in every sense national interest
 masalan,desh kaa jal prabandhan dhahne kii kagaar par he
 Water crisis is in front of the country as a national crisis
 usee tarah bhayaavah berojgaare or kisaanon kii badahaali rashtriya vipadaa se kamatar nahin he
 These three issues are the emergency demands of the nation
 jalsankat kii tivrata kaa akalan
 
 
 There is a water crisis in the country
 do-teen saal se kuch zyaada hi bhayaavah sthiti banati ja rahi he
 More than half of the cultivated land in the country is irrigated
 mausam kii thodi-si oonch-neech se desh main sookhaa pad jaataa he yaa baadh aa jaati he
 With the government's focus on water management in the country, farmers are dying to spend heavily on private water arrangements
 iskaa kaaran bhi janaa ja chukaa he
 Construction of new reservoirs and dams to stop the rainwater is closed, while double the capacity of water storage is available in the country
 is prabandhan ko praathmik banane ke liye dhan chahie
 According to experts, at least 15 lakh crore is spent for this work in the first five years
 yani har saal teen lakh karod rupee
 Unemployment and stealing are now dangerous
 
 
 san2020aate-aate berojgaare kii samasya bekaabu hoti dikh rahi he
 No matter how much we call demographic dividend to the growing population of youth, the signs of unemployment are seen as an economic curse, so no major plan to introduce six to eight crore unemployed in the budget is started immediately, so it will be very Would be considered a major drawback
 desh ke yuva aisi baaten sunne ke mood main bilkul nahin dikhte ki2025tak berojgaare khatm kar di jaaegi yaa2030tak desh main ek bhi berojgaar nahin bachegaa
 The secret of railway budget should be revealed 
 
 teen saal pehle tak rail bajet alag se pesh hua karata tha
 a new government came in and stopped the practice in 2016
 rail bajet ko aam bajet main hi mila diya gaya tha
 As a result, the scope for more discussion on the rail budget was reduced, while it is still the largest government enterprise
 railway se desh kii136karod kii aabaadi kii rozmarra kii zindagi se judi he
 Even today, it is considered the world's largest government transport system
 kalyankari rajya kii sankalpana main bhartiya rail pranali janakalyankari to he hi,sarkaar ko usase acchhee-khaasi aamadani bhi hoti he
 Railways have a lot of land and tremendous resources, and huge potential for employment
 ho saktaa he,desh ke maujuuda mali haalat main railway ke bare main kuch nayaa sunne ko mili
 At present, the reality is not known, but in the case of railways, it is possible to hear the buzzing that there may be an intention to increase private participation in this government enterprise

 These days, adult comedy films are out and they have a solid lineup this year
 aise main central board of film certification (sibiefasi) ke liye kaaphi mehnat kaa kaam bhi he kyonki aisi filmon ko kai cat ke baad hi relies hone kaa mauka miltaa he
 If the sources are to be believed, then the Censor Board has refused to give the censor certificate to director Indra Kumar's film Great Grand Masti and this has been done due to double meaning dialogue and some scenes
 sensor board ne apane suzav team ko de die hai
 Now it remains to be seen whether the team of 'great Grand Masti' film implements the suggestions of the censor board
 film ko indra kumaar ne diarect kiya he or isamen ritash deshmukh,vivek oberoiore aftab shivadaasaani lead role main hai
 The film is releasing on 25 March
 film kii team kaa aglaa kadam dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 First Airtel, then Idea and now Vodafone have launched unlimited free calling plans across the country to give a tough competition to Reliance Jio
 pehle preeped pack kii shuruyaat 144 se 149 rupee ke bich he
 Under this pack, free unlimited calling can be made from Vodafone to Vodafone across the country
 iske alaava 50MB data bhi milegaa
 The validity of this pack will be 28 days
 khaas baat yah he ki is pack ke tahat free neshnal roming bhi milegi or agar aapke paas 4G handset he to aapako 300MB 4G data bhi milegaa
 The second pack is between 344 to 349 rupees, in which local STD free unlimited calling will be available on any mobile or landline
 is pack kii bhi validity 28 dinon kii hogi or iske saath 50MB data milegaa
 1GB 4G data will be available for 4G handset users
 iske saath bhi free neshnal inakming roming kii suvidha milegi
 Vodafone Chief Commercial Officer Sandeep Kataria has said, 'we have recently made a free incoming call on national roaming across the country
 ab in analimited colling plan ke saath ab or yugers ko or bhi phayda hoga'airtel or edia ne bhi 150 rupee or 350 rupee ke andar hi kamobeshwadaphone jaisaa hi plan lonchakia he jo sirf preeped customers ke liye hai
 Apart from this, BSNL has already announced that in the coming days a pack of Rs 149 will be brought which will compete with Jio
 gauratlab he ki reliance jeeyo ke plan kii shuruaati keemat bhi 149 rupee he
 Under this pack, users will get unlimited calling and 300MB data across the country
 lekin iske liye aapke paas 4ji handset hona jaruri he
 Interestingly, to use these plans of Airtel, Vodafone and Idea, you do not even need to get a 4G smartphone
 jabaki aap reliance jeeyo tab tak yuj nahin kar sakate jab tak aapke paas 4ji handset nahin he
 In such a situation, it is clear that slowly people will be disillusioned with Jio, because those who already have a better smartphone and do not want to get a new 4G smartphone will take plans from other companies
 maujuuda telecom bazaar main ab jeeyo ko sahi myanon main takkar mil to rahi he, lekin abhi bhi postped yugers ke liye kuch khaas elaan nahin kiya gaya he

 For photography, a 16-megapixel rear can be given in it
 gauratlab he ki Mi 5 isi saal march main launch hua tha or ise behtareen respons bhi mila
 Despite the strong smartphone, it did not create a panic in the market like the Mi 3 had created
 company koiske agle vairient se kafiummiden hai
 It will be interesting to see if the company gives such powerful specifications in this smartphone

 lihaaja maharashtra main siyaasi khinchataan ke bich bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne ‘oparation lotus’ shuru kar diya he
 The BJP has engaged in the task of mobilizing mlas to pass the floor test in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly
 sutron ke mutabik bijepi ne vidhansabha main floor test se pehle bahumat ke jaadui aankade tak pahunchane ke liye chaar netaaon kii ek team bhi bana di he, jise shivasena, ensipi or congress ke vidhayakon se sampark karne kii jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 BJP Nanarayana Rane, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Ganesh Naik and Babanrao Pachpute have been given the responsibility of getting a majority for the floor test in the assembly

 donon hi dalon main rane kii acchhee paith maani jaati he
 Rane himself has also said that all are my friends except Uddhav in Shiv Sena and Ashok Chavan in Congress
 1999 main shivasena kii sarkaar ke mukhyamantri bhi rah chuke rane kii uddhav se kabhi nahin pati
 Rane joined the Congress after being expelled from the Shiv Sena in 2005 and formed the Maharashtra Swabhiman Paksha after leaving from there
 fadanvis kaa karj utaar paaenge rane?narayan rane bijepi main vaapasi kii koshish main the
 The BJP was also ready to take him due to his close proximity, but due to coalition partner Shiv Sena, the wait for Rane was prolonged
 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan devendra fadanvis ke prayaas se vah bijepi main shaamil hue
 It remains to be seen whether Rane's Fadnavis will be able to repay the debt or not
 rane ne kiya tha sarkaar banane kaa daavakuch din pehle hi narayan rane ne bijepi kii sarkaar banane kaa daawa kiya tha
 After the imposition of President's rule in the state, Rane had given a statement to try his best to form the BJP government
 unhone kaha tha ki sarkaar banane ke liye jo bhi karnaa hoga, vah karenge
 The Shiv Sena has taught the goods, prices, punishment and distinction

 bijepi ke pravaktaa prakaash jaavdekar ne shanivaar ko press conference kii or kaha ki adwani ji sachmuch biimaar hai
 The doctor has advised them to rest
 isi vajah se ve agle 3-4 din tak keval aaraam karenge
 Javadekar said that Rajnath Singh has also advised Advani not to take stress
 rajnath ne phone par adwani ko yah salaah di
 Javadekar told that Advani has given best wishes to BJP workers
 jab prakaash jaavdekar se adwani kii beemaari ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki yah mausam badalane kii vajah se he, koi badi beemaari nahin he
 Javadekar said that Advani has been his guide and will remain
 bina adwani ke shuru hui kaaryakarinibijepi rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak shuru ho gai he
 The special thing is that senior leader LK Advani is not in this meeting
 adwani kaaryakarini main modimay maahaul se naaraaz bataae ja rahe hai
 In the executive meeting, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley have been given place along with party president Rajnath Singh on the stage
 narendra modi pichhali qatari main baithe hai, jabaki shivaraj singh chouhan pehali pankti main hai
 It is being told that BJP has made up its mind to step forward in the name of Modi without Advani

 Maybe the BJP is completely shattered and it is also possible that the party's fleet may cross
 goa main shanivaar bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak se pehle hi bijepi ke bheetar matbhedon ke sur oonche ho gaye
 Senior BJP leader LK Advani objected to Modi being given the command of the campaign committee, while the Modi faction is looking at his future in Modi itself
 modi samarthak har haal main modi ke sar sehara sajaa dekhnaa chaahate hai
 On Friday, Advani did not reach Goa to attend a meeting of BJP officials
 kaha gaya ki unki tabiyat thik nahin he
 But the 'inside talk' was about Modi
 kayaas the ki shanivaar subah adwani goa pahunchenge, kyonki shanivaar subah 10 baje unki goa kii flite tay thi
 But even this did not happen
 shanivaar subah unhone flite radd karvaa di or kaha ki unki tabiyat 'thik' nahin he
 It has officially become clear that Advani is not reaching Goa on Saturday
 khabar he ki adwani ke baad unheen ke gut ke yashavanth sinha or bi si khanduri bhi bijepi rashtriya kaaryakarini main bhaag lene nahin ja rahe hai
 Advani can be reached on Sunday in a two-day working executive
 haalanki yah bhi pakke taur kaha nahin ja saktaa
 Earlier on Friday, several big leaders of the party including Rajnath Singh tried to convince LK Advani, but Advani did not agree
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar, ab gend sangh ke paale main he
 The Sangh is going to decide whether to stamp Modi's name or not
 sutara kehete hai ki sangh kii ore se sanket die gaye hai ki yadi adwani nahin bhi aate to bhi narendra modi ke naam kii ghoshnaa kar di jaani chahie
 In such a situation, it is now certain that Narendra Modi will be handed over the command of the campaign committee
 ravivaar shaam ko rajnath singh press conference karke is bare main ghoshnaa kar sakate hai
 The BJP has split into two parts regarding Modi's role in the 2014 general elections

 mumbai hamale 'khufiagiri ke itihaas main sabase gambhir chukon main se ek' ke parinaam ke chalate hue jisamen america, britain or bhartiya guptchar agenciyaan bharat kii vittiya rajdhani par hamale ko taalane ke liye apane hitech nigaraanee tantra dwaara jutai gai jaankaree ko ek saath rakhane main naakaam raheen
 a detailed report from the New York Times, propublica and PBS series 'frontline' titled 'in 2008 Mumbai Killings, Piles of Spy Data, But an Uncomplicated Puzzle' says, "the hidden history of the Mumbai attacks is sensitivity, computer monitoring power and Reveals intercepts to be anti-terrorism weapon
 ' This detailed report states, 'what happened next is one of the deadliest lapses in the history of intelligence
 teen deshon kii khufia agenciyaan apane hitech nigaraanee or anya upkarnon dwaara jutai gai sabhi jaankaree ko ekasaath rakhane main naakaam raheen, jinase aatanki hamale ko roka ja saktaa tha, jo itnaa bhayaavah tha ki ise aksar bharat kaa 9 / 11 kaha jaataa he
 ' report main kaha gaya he ki sabase badi khufia vifaltaa ke udaahranon main se ek main bhartiya or british khufia agenciyon ne 26 / 11 kii yojana banane vaale or pakistan aadhaarit lashkar e taiyaba aatanki samooh ke praudyogiki pramukh jaraar shah kii online gatividhiyon par najar rakhi thi, lekin ve hamalon se pehle 'kadiyon ko nahin jod pain
 '166 people including six Americans were killed in Mumbai attacks
 isamen abhiyaan par jaankaree dene vaale ek purv adhikari ke hawaale se kaha gaya he, 'sirf britain kii khufia agenciyaan hi us par nigaah nahin rakh rahi thim
 An Indian intelligence agency was also keeping a similar eye on Shah
 ' The report said that although the US was unaware of the efforts of agencies in both countries, it had caught some signs of conspiracy from other electronic and human sources, and had warned Indian security officials several times before the attack
 isamen hamalon se maheenon pehle america, bharat or britain kii agenciyon dwaara jutai gai khufia soochna ke sandarbh main purv suraksha salaahkaar shivashankar menon ke hawaale se kaha gaya he ki 'kisi ne bhi samoochee tasviir ko saaf nahin kiya

 jab golibari shuru ho gai to har kisi ne soochna saajha kerani shuru kar di
 ' haalanki is report main kaha gaya ki america se alert ke baavjood bharat sajeesh kaa pataa nahin laga paaya
 One of the important signs that the American missed was related to the activities of David Headley, a pakistani-american who had sought targets for the Mumbai attacks and was in contact with the conspirators via emails
 lekin america 2009 ke ant main chicago main uski giraftaar tak uski gatividhiyon se anjaan rahaa
 The report said that the US anti-terrorism agencies also failed to act on the information received from Headley's disgruntled wife
 hedli kii patni ne mumbai hamalon se kaaphi pehle america adhikariyon ko bataaya tha ki uskaa pati ek pakistani aatankwaadi he or vah mumbai main rahasyamay mishan chalaa rahaa he

 But now, concern is being felt in China

 modi sarkaar soshal sector main apane prayaason ko aage badhaate hue ab maid, driver jaise gharelu kamgaaron ke liye ek rashtriya niti laane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 This will benefit about 50 lakh people
 shram mantri santosh gangavar ne yah jaankaree di he
 The objective of bringing this policy is to help domestic workers and benefit them from government policies
 is policy kii pahunch aapke ghar ke andar tak hogi
 This will greatly reduce the days of domestic servants, drivers etc
 and they will get all the facilities that the organized sector employees get
 yah niti lagu hui to unhen unhen iesai, bhavishya nidhi, savetan avkaash, maatrutiv avkaash vagairah jaisi suvidhaayen mil sakati hai
 According to a report, the 'national Policy for Domestic Workers' was first proposed in 2015
 isse logon ko na keval apane gharelu naukaron, driveron ko zyada selary deni padegi, balki isse kagaji kaarywahi bhi bad jaaegi
 Therefore, this policy has not been implemented due to opposition for the last four years
 santosh gangavar ne loksabhaa main bataaya ki gharelu kamgaaron ke bare main ek rashtriya praaroop taiyaar he jis par centre sarkaar vichaar kar rahi he
 Under this policy, domestic workers will also be included in all the existing manuals and after registering them they will be empowered as legitimate workers
 iske alaava gharelu kamgaaron ko apane sanghathan or union banane kaa bhi adhikaar hoga
 Through this, servants-drivers will get the right to minimum wages, access to social security schemes and protection from abuse, harassment and violence
 iske alaava, praaroop niti main prastaav rakhaa gaya he ki gharelu naukaron ko muhaiyaa karaane vaale placement agenciyon ko bhi niyantrit or viniyamit kiya jayega
 It will also be possible to improve their professional skills and get the benefit of the services of courts and tribunals
 sarkaar pichley chaar saal se sarkaar ise laane kii koshish kar rahi he, lekin kai virgon ke virodh kii vajah se aisa nahin ho paa rahaa
 All men and women will be involved in this policy
 abhi desh main gharelu naukaron ke liye koi niyam-kaayda nahin he
 People keep domestic servants at their will based on information and inquiries from each other
 inke vetan, chhuttiyon aadi kaa nirdhaaran bhi aapasi sahmati ke aadhaar par hota he
 The new system will be very much on the lines of foreign countries, where the domestic servants have to follow very strict rules and regulations
 somvaar ko jammu-kashmir ke navnirvaachit siem mufti mohammai said ne centre sarkaar seafjal guru ke avshesh maange
 Politics in the state started making rhetoric in this direction and the saffron brigade of the country once again turned against Afzal by calling Afzal guilty and a terrorist
 lekin in sab ke bich congress ne maukey par chaukaa maaraa he
 Mani Shankar Aiyar, who reached Parliament House on Tuesday, said that there was injustice to Afzal
 sansad bhawan ke baahar bayaan dete hue congress ke varisht netaa ne kaha ki afjal guru ke khilaaf paryaapt saboot nahin the or unka aisa maananaa he ki afjal ke saath ninsaphi hui thi
 The special thing is that when Iyer was making this statement outside the House, at the same time, the Government was introducing the Insurance Bill in the Lok Sabha
 yah bill pehle se hi vivaadon main he, lihaaja vipaksh kii koshish sarkaar ko sadan ke andar or baahar donon ore se gherne kii he
 Afzal was anti-national: Raut meanwhile Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has given his response in the case
 unhone kaha ki afjal ko faansee di gai, kyonki vah raashtra virdohi tha
 Raut said, 'afzal was punished by the Supreme Court and the law
 agar manishankar ayyar ko lagata he ki afjal ke saath ninsaphi hui thi to unhen yah bayaan pakistan main jaakar dena chahie yahaan nahin
 'it is worth mentioning that Chief Minister Saeed's government has demanded the Central Government to hand over the remains of Afzal Guru, the accused in the Parliament attack
 pidipi sarkaar kii is maang par grahamantri rajnath singh ne philhal koi sidhaa jawaab nahin diya he, haalanki bijepi vidhayakon kii ore se virodh ke swar uthne shuru ho gaye hai
 Eight mlas of the PDP issued a statement in this regard, saying that the party promises to be vigorously engaged to return Afzal's remains
 guru ko nau farvari 2013 ko tihaad jail main faansee di gai thi
 Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Justice Deepak Mishra is facing double attacks nowadays
 nyaaypalika ke bheetar se bhi or vipakshi raajnneetik dalon kii ore se bhi
 On the one hand, political parties are talking about impeachment of Justice Mishra, on the other hand, after the Chief Justice in the Supreme Court, the senior-most judge Justice Jasti Chelameswar has written another letter to the Chief Justice to call full court meeting on executive pressure in the work of the judiciary because Ignoring the collegium system of the judiciary, direct the executive to the High Court judge It is not appropriate to communicate in any way
 justise chelmeshwaraki is chitthee par nyaaypalika ke galiyaaron main khaasi charchaa he
 It is said that even Chief Justice Deepak Mishra should have lodged a protest against the interference of the executive regarding the autonomy of the judiciary
 darasal justise chelmeshwar press conference se pehle or baad main bhi kai bermukhya nyaayadhishko chitthee likhakar unki kaaryastylee par kanoonee or sanvaidhanik sawaal uthaa chuke hai
 This time, he has made it a point to resume a probe against Karnataka District and Sessions Judge p Krishna Bhatt
 justise chelmeshwar kaa aarope he ki mukhya nyaayadhish justise mishra ne centre sarkaar ke kehane par dabaav main aakar dobaaraa jaanch karaane ke nirdesh karnataka hai court ke chif justise dinesh maheshwari ko die hai
 Otherwise, after the recommendation of the Supreme Court Collegium, the Chief Justice of the High Court has no point in starting a re-investigation from his mind
 supreme court ke sabhi jajon ko bheji gai 5 pannon kii chitthee main justise chelmeshwar ne likhaa he ki tab jabaki supreme court colegium agast or november 2016 main do baar bhatta ko karnataka hoicourt kaa jaj niyukt karne kii sifarish kar chukaa he
 Whenever the recommendation reaches the government, a woman who has worked with Bhatt, the charges against a judicial officer, stand against Bhatt
 sarkaar ne pichhali baar bhi jab jaj bhatta ko justise banane kii kojium kii sifarish waapas bheji thi tab ke CJI justise tirath singh thakur ne justise maheshwari se pehle chif justise rahe nyaayamurti shubhr camel mukherjee se jaanch karai thi
 Then Judge Bhatt got a clean chit
 darasal jaj bhatta ke khilaaf ek mahila jeudicial adhikari ne pratadna ke aarope lagaae the
 After the clean chit of Justice Mukherjee, when the file of Bhatt goes on to become High Court Judge, the letters of those women officers start reaching the Supreme Court and the government
 justise chelmeshwar kii chitthee par charchaa ke saath hi sansad ke galiyaaron main kuch vipakshi dalon ke netaa gupachup to kuch ke khuleam baaten kar rahe hai ki chif justise deepak mishra ke khilaaf mahabhiyog prastaav par dastakhat karne vaale saansadon kii taadaad dhire-dhire bad rahi he, yani sankat tab or bad jaataa he jab muqabla ek saath do morchon par ho

 In 2016, people were surprised to see a large bunker there when a 20 feet high wall fell
 ye bunker 15 hajaar varg feet kshetra main failaa he or isamen 13 kamare hai
 After getting this bunker in 2016, its repair work was done
 ab is puure bunker ko museum (sangrahalay) main badal diya gaya he
 From October, ordinary citizens will also be able to visit this bunker after online booking
 photo- mangesh ambrabunkar main kai kamare aise hai jo storage ke liye istemaal kiye jate the
 How the strategic importance in the design of the bunker was then taken into account, this shows that the Arabian Sea is seen from three sides
 adhikariyon ke anumaan ke mutabik governors house ke neeche is bunker kaa nirmaan pratham vishwa yuddh se pehle kiya gaya
 However, it can only be confirmed after proper investigation that when this bunker was actually constructed
 british hukumat ke dauraan governors house kaa nirmaan varsh 1802 main hua tha
 This bunker was found under this
 bunker ke upar badi topon ko rakhaa gaya tha
 About 100 years ago, the best construction techniques were used for bunker construction
 bunker main hathiyaaron or golabarood kaa bada bhandar rahata tha
 Underneath the entire bunker was the way for water pipes
 ye isliye tha ki agar kabhi aag lagane kii sthiti aati to in pipe se pani chhodkar aag par kaabo paaya ja saktaa tha
 Photo- Ventilation was arranged from the roof of Mangesh Ambrebankar
 chat par das feet bade ventilation (roshanadaan) ko is tarah banaaya gaya tha ki suraj kii roshni or hawa bunker main aati rahe
 Now after the bunker was made a museum, centralized AC has been arranged
 museum ko oktober ke pehle hafte main aam nagarikon ke liye kholaa jayega
 Officials say that the British rulers feared an attack from the Arabian Sea during the First World War
 tab kaarobaar ke lihaaj se mumbai british ke liye sabase ahm ranneetik rajyon main ek tha
 Hence this bunker was built during the First World War to strengthen security
 ye bunker se judi ek theory he lekin isaki aadhikarik taur par pushti jaanch ke baad hi ho sakati he
 The possibility of a Shinmaiwa US-2 search and rescue aircraft deal between India and Japan has increased
 tokyo ne deal cancil hone ke aa rahi khabaron ke bich kaha he ki japan bharat se dosti ke liye yah samjhauta chahta he

 Tokyo's statement comes amid reports that the deal price of 12 aircraft with Japan and cancellation could not be reached on the issue of technology transfer

 In the $ 6 billion aircraft deal, Japan will try its best to bring down the prices
 agar donon deshon ke bich yah samjhauta hota he, to china ko yah sandesh jayega ki bharat or japan raksha kshetra main ek-duusare ke saath hai
 Significantly, India and Japan are struggling with regional aggression of China
 japan kii ore se keemten kam karne ke sanketajapan ke raksha mantralay ke ek adhikari ne kaha, 'agar yah samjhauta hota he, to bharat ke saath hamaare sambandhon par iskaa behatar prabhaav padegaa
 We understand that discussions are going on from the Indian side about the price
 keemten kai karkon par nirbhar karti hai
 We are doing this deal not for economic gain, but for friendly relations with India and as far as possible prices will be reduced

 The script of the film was like a warning for any actor to lose everything

 '' View this post on instagramagneepath gave me the opportunity of going all guns blazing
 Rarely does a script come along which warrants the actor to risk everything
 Including his bones
 Those are the kind of roles i look for
 Otherwise I'm just the laziest guy
 i was shooting for ZNMD in Spain when Karan Johar sent Karan malhotra to narrate the script inspite of me very vehemently turning down the idea of a remake of the classic
 
 He was right
 
 Cause after i heard the narration, i just couldn’t say no
 
 Rest is history
 
 Had some fun while meditating on the poem today with my phone
 
 And right now all i want to do for the rest of my life is action movies

 In the first week of November, when the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, came to speak at the Samajwadi Party's Silver Jubilee celebrations amidst heavy rage and boasting, he gave a big message to his supporters and opponents in just one line
 akhilesh ne kaha 'jab talwaar haath main di he to yaad rakho ise chalaaungaa bhi'
 This form of Akhilesh was in complete contrast to the time of his coronation to the post of Chief Minister
 paanch saal pehle jab akhilesh ne mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee to unhen mukhyamantri kam or apane pita, chachaa or munhabhole anklon kii chhatrachhaaya main baitha 'tipu' zyada samajha gaya
 But today Akhilesh is not only one of the most popular leaders of UP but in all the surveys, he is being declared as the first choice of the public for the post of CM
 raajnneeti ke diggaj unka ye nayaa rup or aatmavishvaas dekhakar hairaan hai
 But there are some solid reasons behind his stubbornness to pass this tax
 sapa sarkaar nahin akhilesh sarkaarpanch saal pehle jab samaajawaadee party aitihaasik jeet hasil kar upi kii satta par kabiz hui thi to media or janata ke bich upi kii kanoon vyavastha ko lekar ashanka jataai jane lagi thim
 Five years old Mulayam's rule was in front of everyone
 ye bhi mana ja rahaa tha ki akhilesh naam ke hi mukhyamantri rahane vaale hai aise main unki saaf chhavi yaa nek niyat se zyada asar nahin padane vaala lekin aisi ashankaayen baad main galat sabit huin
 The law and order of UP has improved completely today, it cannot be said that there is a decline in it compared to Mayaraj
 khaskar tab jabaki akhilesh ko anubhavheen to mayawati ko sakht prashaasak mana jaataa rahaa he
 Talk of development Akhilesh Yadav knows that sp's traditional yadav-muslim alliance formula cannot get votes all the time
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main bhi party ko iskaa sabak mila jahaan uskaa puure pradesh main takreeban supada saaf ho gaya
 This is probably the lesson of Lok Sabha elections that Akhilesh is seen talking about development in every meeting and program
 pichley chunaav main jahaan akhilesh kranti rath ke saath nikle the, vahiin is baar unhone apane rath ko samaajawaadee vikaas rath naam diya
 The message is clear that development will remain at the top of Akhilesh's election plan
 yuva netritukhilesh yuva hai or yuvaaon ko lubhaane ke liye pichley chunaav main laptop baantne kaa unka idia superhit rahaa
 Even after forming the government, he left no stone unturned to woo this new voter-making class
 ab jabaki unka kaarykaal khatm hone ko he to unhone laptop kii tarah is baar smartphone baantne kaa elaan kiya hua he
 Clean image: Different ministers of Akhilesh Yadav government have been accused of corruption
 unke chachashivpalaur ramgopal tak isaki chapet main aae magar khud akhilesh ke khilaaf aisa koi bada maamla saamne nahin aayaa he jisase unki chhavi par koi aanch aati
 Especially the way he showed the way out to tainted ministers and Shivpal Yadav got separated from the government also strengthened his image
 dimple kaa saedgar ye kahen ki patnidimple yadavaaaj akhilesh yadav or unki samaajawaadee party ke liye utani hi mahatvapurn hai jitani congress ke liye priyanka gandhi to galat nahin hoga
 Rather, Dimple is also an MP from the party i

 to salmaan khan ke vakil mahesh bora ne kaha ki nahin sahab chhuttiyon ke samay log kaam ke mood main nahin hote hai aap janvari main de dijie
 The judge said that January would be too long, the hearing would be delayed

 Salman Khan's lawyer said that the holidays are difficult

 is tarah se salmaan khan ke maamle main sunwaayee ke liye 19 disambar kii date rakh di gai he
 During this, the lawyer of Bishnoi society Mahipal Bishnoi said - There is some news cutting in the documents presented in the court on behalf of Salman Khan's lawyer
 jisamen kaha gaya he ki salmaan khan ko jodhpur main peshi par aane se khatra he
 It should be investigated

 Farmers protesting against RCEP treaty: On Monday, farmers across the country will take to the streets to protest against India's involvement in the Indian Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a cause for India's dairy industry ruin

 Not only this, India's dairy industry will be completely ruined

 Farmers say that if this treaty happens, one-third of the country's market will be occupied by New Zealand, America and European countries and the value of their produce will fall in the farmers of India
 isi maddenjar desh main kareeb 250 kisaan sanghathan jila or sthaneey str par iske virodh main pradarshan karenge
 Farmers 'organizations worry that farmers' organizations say that the condition of farmers in the country is already very bad

 Ignoring the plight of the farmers, the government is going to sign the RCEP which ruined the farmers
 aarasieepi par bharat ke hastakshar karne ke baad desh kaa deyari udyog puri tarah se tabah ho jayega
 All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee coordinator VM Singh says that milk production is the only means of income for small farmers, so if the government makes a RCEP agreement then the dairy industry will be completely destroyed and 80% Farmers will become unemployed

 Under this, there will be no tax to be paid on exports or very little

 Farmers' organizations say that most farmers in India have 2 to 4 cows, which their families run with milk
 vahiin, duusari ore newjiland ke kisaanon ke paas 1000-1000 kii sankhya main gaay hai
 The import duty on 90 per cent of goods will be zero due to the RCEP agreement
 isse bhartiya udyogon or kisaanon kii qamar puri tarah tut jaaegi
 Under the RCEP, it is proposed to include dairy products in the Free Trade Agreement, which farmers are opposing
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki agar aarasieepi lagu ho gaya or baahar se doodh kaa aayaat kiya gaya to bharat ke doodh ke kisaan puri tarah se tabah ho jaaenge

 a day after UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon's speech, US Secretary of State John Carrey also asked US newly elected President Donald Trump not to back down on the issue of climate change
 trump kii dhamkee kii ore ishaara karte hue kairi ne kaha ki chunaav prachaar main bahut kuch kaha jaataa he, lekin padbhaar sanbhaalane par mudde duusari tarah se dekhne padate hai
 Trump, during his election campaign, has been calling out the threat of climate change and said that he would pull the US out of the Paris deal last year after becoming president
 lekin morocco main america videsh mantri ne jalwaayu parivartan ke khataron ko ek sachai bataate hue kaha ki america samet puri duniya ko isse ladanaa hoga
 Carrie pointed to Trump's statement, saying, "with the commencement of the climate change conference, there was an election in my country and i know that there is uncertainty about the future in the minds of many people
" main nahin jaanata or yahaan par nahin kah saktaa ki hamaare nae raashtrapati kya nitiyaan apanaayenge, lekin main aapse ye baat kah saktaa hum
 In the time i have spent in public life, i have learned one thing that it is a different thing to make a statement in an election campaign, but after coming to power, some subjects have to be seen in a completely different way
 ' Earlier on Tuesday, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon also said he hoped Donald Trump would revisit his 'election statement'
 kairi ne mangalvaar ko die moon ke bhaashan kii tarj par hi saura urja or saaf suthri urja se jude sadhano ke bazaar kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki khel ke niyam ab sarkarein nahin balki bazaar tay karegaa
 The comments kairi ne apane ghante bhar ke bhaashan main paris deal ko lekar saare deshon ke sahyog or obama ke role kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki agar paryaavaran or jalwaayu parivartan ke maamle main abhi kuch nahin kiya gaya to ye ek 'naitik asafalataa' hogi
 Clearly, considering the importance of the agreement reached in Paris and the commitment of all countries, efforts are being made to put all-round pressure on the trump
 paris main hui deal ke tahat america ko na keval apana koyale or shell gas kaa istemaal ghataana hoga, balki us par garib or vikasshil deshon ko paise or technology kii madad karne kii zimmedaari bhi he
 Trump is scheduled to take over as President of the US in January, and everyone is eyeing whether he will accept this commitment or oust America from the Paris deal
 trump apane chunaav prachaar ke dauraan jalwaayu parivartan ke khatre ko hauvva bataate rahe hai or unhone ye kaha ki vah raashtrapati banane ke baad america ko pichley saal hui paris deal se baahar nikaal lenge
 But in Morocco, the US Secretary of State, describing the dangers of climate change as a truth, said that the whole world, including America, would have to fight it

 Carrie pointed to Trump's statement, saying, "with the commencement of the climate change conference, there was an election in my country and i know that there is uncertainty about the future in the minds of many people
" main nahin jaanata or yahaan par nahin kah saktaa ki hamaare nae raashtrapati kya nitiyaan apanaayenge, lekin main aapse ye baat kah saktaa hum
 In the time i have spent in public life, i have learned one thing that it is a different thing to make a statement in an election campaign, but after coming to power, some subjects have to be seen in a completely different way
 ' Earlier on Tuesday, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon also said he hoped Donald Trump would revisit his 'election statement'
 kairi ne mangalvaar ko die moon ke bhaashan kii tarj par hi saura urja or saaf suthri urja se jude sadhano ke bazaar kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki khel ke niyam ab sarkarein nahin balki bazaar tay karegaa

 shivasena ne rajyasabha main CAB kii voting ke vakt virodh main walkout kiya tha

 paryaavaran mantralay ne da privension of cruelity tu animals (regulation of livestock markets) niyam 2017 ko notiphoi kar diya he
 The purpose of this notification is to regulate the purchase and sale of animals in the cattle market as well as to prevent cruelty against cattle
 is notification ke baad niyamon ke mutabik maveshi ko bazaar main kharidne yaa bechney laane vaale ko ye sunishchit karnaa hoga ki maveshi ko bazaar main katl ke makasad se kharidne yaa bechney ke liye nahin laayaa gaya he
 For this, both the buying and selling members will have to give an undertaking to the member secretary of the Animal Market Committee
 bina rajyamaveshi sangrakshankanoon kii manjuuri ke kharidaar maveshi ko rajya ke baahar bhi nahin bech sakegaa
 Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan says that animals like cow, bull, buffalo, bull, calf, camel fall into this category
 haalanki ye niyam bazaar ke liye hai or maweshiyon kii vyaktigat taur par kharid- bikri ko isamen spasht nahin kiya gaya he
 50 to 60 percent of the animals for slaughterhouses come from these cattle markets
 lihaaja notification ke baad meet ke vyapaar par is asar padegaa
 This notification clarified the definition of the market, where animals are brought from different places for sale or auction
 jila str par ek district animal market monitering kamity banegi
 Apart from this, the Animal Market Committee will be formed at the local level

 The buyer has to give a declaration that he will not sell the cattle for 6 months
 ab se maveshi kii dharmik uddeshy se bali bhi nahin di ja sakegi

 But he refused and then the police took him with him in his car
 drame kaa ant yaheen par hi nahin hua
 On reaching the police station, the boy refused to even get off the car
 jab nitish kumaar loksabhaa chunaav ke liye prachaar main jute the or apana sab kuch jhonke hue the, us samay unhen is baat kaa jaraa-sa bhi ilm nahin rahaa hoga ki nateezon ke baad unhen satta sukh ko tyaagna pad saktaa he
 The manner in which his declared rival, Narendra Modi, by putting up a washerman and dusting him in two seats, forced Nitish to 'take moral responsibility' of the defeat and step down
 is saare khel main vakt behad ahm rahaa
 The news of Nitish's resignation on Saturday surprised the people, but in fact it proved to be another example of his political ingenuity
 jedy (you) ke ek ranneetikaar bataate hai, ''aisi karaari haar ke baad nitish ko sanbhaalane ke liye kuch samay chahie tha
 He could not hold on to the chief minister's chair as it would have added more spice to his opponents in both the ruling party and the opposition
 na hi ve nae vidhansabha chunaav kaa jokhim mol le sakate the kyonki janata ke mood se saaf tha ki bijepi baaji maar le jaaegi
 In such a situation, there was only one way to make a clever move
 unhone bhavishya main lambii chalaang lagane ke liye philhal do kadam peeche badha liye
 Nitish resigned the very next day after the Lok Sabha results, till then the election results could not be investigated properly
 yah party main vidroh hone se pehle hi dabaane kii chaal thi or ve usamen kaamyaab rahe
 All those who could suffocate him were forced to give up opposition
 ab tamaam asantusht unki vafadari kii kasame khaane or unke hisaab se chalane par majaboor hai
 Even after resigning, Nitish is twelve
 2014 main bhale hi dhul chaatni padi ho lekin unhone 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main endie ko 40 main se 32 or 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 243 siten dilaai thim
 Taking the moral responsibility of defeat and handing over the throne to Mahadalit MLA Jitan Ram Manjhi, he silenced all the critics in the party
 nitish ab naitikta ke singhaasana par virajman hai kyonki unhone na sirf gaddi chodi balki ek mahadalit ko takat dilaai he
 This move has helped in sympathizing some of those who rejected his politics in the Lok Sabha elections
 maanjhi kii sabase badi yogyata unki kamjor rajnatik paith he, shaayad jisaki vajah se hi nitish ne unhen vaaris chunaa he
 Out of all the options, the 69-year-old Manjhi does not have the strength to challenge Nitish in the coming months
 sabase badi baat yah he ki nitish maanjhi ko raah dikhaate rahenge or yah silsilaa november, 2015 main vidhansabha ke chunaav tak chalane kii ummid he
 Nitish has agreed to lead the party in the assembly elections
 nitish ne maanjhi ko sakasham uttaradhikari to kaha he, lekin unhone hi november, 2005 main unhen mantrimandal main shaamil karne ke kuch hi ghante baad hi unase istipha le liya tha
 Reason: His name appearing in the investigation of the surveillance department regarding irregularities in the education department
 april, 2008 main maanjhi ko aarope mukt hone ke baad hi dobaaraa nitish ke mantrimandal main jagah mili
 But even after that, he could not climb in the eyes of Nitish
 june, 2012 main unhone apane saptahik janata darbar main maanjhi ko saream latada tha
 Manjhi had signed the application of a young man seeking a job, which Nitish had to confront him with
 2004 ke chunaav main jedy (you) ne kul 38 ummidavaar utaare the, lekin sirf do jite the
 His loss of mathematics is responsible for this defeat
 june, 2013 main jab nitish ne bijepi se naata todaa to sochaa tha ki siyaasi ganit unka saath degaa
 He had created a backward community by adding 17 per cent Muslims and 12 per cent Mahadalits and who had run schemes keeping them in mind, at least on paper showing them invincible
 lekin voting ke pehle daur main hi jab ye sanket milane lage ki muslim matadaata lalu-congress gathjod kii taraf ja rahaa he or kuch atipichade unka saath chhod kar modi kii taraf jhuk rahe hai to saaf ho gaya ki unka ganit ulataa pad gaya he
 But caught in the chaos of election results, Nitish immediately retaliated
 2005 se nitish kii chaaya main maun khadey party adhyaksh sharad yadav ne mauka bhaanp liya or voter ke haathon pite nitish ko kinare lagane ke mansoobey banane lage
 When Nitish spoke to Sharad Yadav on Saturday, he was advised to resign
 rashtriya str par apana kad badhaane kaa mauka taak rahe, sharad yadav ne apane bharosemand madhyasthon ke jariye lalu yadav se sampark saadhaa or bijepi kii badhat rokane ke liye secular morche kaa pasa phenkaa
 Lalu agreed but placed a condition that he should first remove Nitish
 yah shart sharad yadav ke liye bhi mufeed thi
 Nitish had resigned but could not afford to join hands with Lalu because it would have left him more marginalized
 nitish gut ke uksaane par jedy (you) vidhayakon ne sharad ke formule kaa virodh kiya to unhen peeche hatana padaa
 Yet the 67-year-old party president got Nitish to resign
 kursi chhodie ke baad nitish kaa pehla kaam maanjhi kii raah ke kaante hataane kaa tha, tabhi unki apni vaapasi kaa rasta saaf ho saktaa tha
 At the moment they are successful
 argedy ke teen or bijepi ke do vidhayakon ne sadan se istipha de diya he jisase vidhansabha main sadasyon kii sankhya 237 rah gai he
 Manjhi needs the support of 119 mlas to save the government
 unhone jedy (you) ke 117 vidhayakon ke alaava do nirdaleeyon ko mantri banaakar unka saath pakkaa kar liya
 Now Congress is not needed to save the government
 nitish ne lalu ke saath gathjod ke daravaaje bhi band kar die hai
 Even though his party 15 in the Lok Sabha elections
 7 fisadi vot mili hon lekin unhen ummid he ki 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main nitish kii saakh vot dilaane main kaamyaab hogi
 For this, Manjhi will have to show something in the next 15 months
 haalanki yah baat kehane main aasaan lagati he
 On 20 May, the new chief minister had to stop in the midst of taking the oath as the light of the Raj Bhavan lighted up
 june, 2013 main nitish ke samvaadadaata sammelan main bhi kuch aisa hi hua tha, jab bijepi se naata todgaye ke unke elaan ke vakt hi bijli chali gai or ekaek andhera ho gaya tha
 During his speech, Rahul Gandhi also referred to the fraud done by the diamond businessman Nirav Modi with the bank
 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar ne maalya kii tarah neerav modi ko bhi desh kii janata kaa paise lekar bhaagane diya
 a week before the announcement of the World Cup team, a news has emerged of Team India's trouble
 team india ke up captain or star salaami ballebaaj rohit sharma ko mangalvaar ko practice seshan ke dauraan pair main chot lag gai
 After the injury, Rohit was seen holding the right leg and going out
 samay rahete rohit feet nahin hue to unki chot se team india ko bada jhatka lag saktaa he
 He is an integral part of both the Indian team and the Mumbai Indians, after walking a few steps during the practice session at the Wankhede Stadium, Rohit lay on the ground due to a sudden muscle strain and grabbed his head due to pain
 tabhi mumbai indiens ke physio nitin patel, jinhone pichley dinon bhartiya team ke physio ke rup main bhi kaam kiya he, chotil rohit sharma ke paas pahunche
 After the injury, Rohitrahat was told that after getting initial treatment, he was seen walking on his feet and going to the dressing room
 bataa den ki buudhvaar ko ipel ke ek match main mumbai indiens kaa muqabla kings ilevan punjab ke saath hoga
 However, the official update on Rohit Sharma's injury severity is yet to come
 iske baad hi yah saaf ho paaegaa ki wo punjab ke khilaaf khel paaenge yaa nahin
 In the current season of IPL, two players from Team India and Mumbai Indians, including Rohit, have suffered injuries
 rohit se pehle ipel ke dauraan hi bhartiya gendbaaji kii dhar maane jane vaale jasprit bumraah ko ko bhi chot lagi thi
 After which questions were raised about his play in the World Cup

 haal ke dinon main kamyaabi ke lihaaz se shooting ke baad kushti ko bharat kaa sabase kaamyaab olympic khel kaha ja saktaa he
 But, World Championship and Olympic success ke baavjood yah khel khastahal he
 Its actors are seeking help from the corporate sector and state governments
 hungary main hui kushti kii world championships main pehle amit kumaar or bajrang puniya ne free style main padak jeet kar itihaas Set up
 phir banaras ke sunil yadav ne greeko roman varg main bharat kaa pehali baar padak jeet kar sabko hairaan kar diya It is another matter that despite all this, the Indian Wrestling Association was able to give silver medalist Amit Kumar five lakh rupees and bronze medalists Bajrang Punia and Sandeep Yadav only three lakh rupees in a modest honor ceremony
 kushti sangh ke adhyaksh brijbhushan sharan singh kehete hai, ham isse zyada kya karen
 We have no money
 is tarah ke aayojan main bhi nau−das lakh rupee lag jate hai
 These are very difficult to do
 world championships main padak jeetne vaale amit kumaar or bajrang puniya dilli ke chhatrasaal stadium main mahabali satpal ke nirdesan main kushti kaa hunar maanjte hai
 Most of the success in Indian wrestling is coming through wrestlers from Haryana and Delhi
 lekin, khilaadi or adhikari is baat par jor dete hai ki bhartiya team kii bench strength acchhee he
 Double Olympic medalist Sushil and London Olympic bronze medalist Yogeshwar say that now all are good wrestlers in the weight category
 isliye hamaari bench strength acchhee he, lekin ye sabhi maanate hai desh main or bhi kushti ke centre kii zarurat he
 Mahabali Satpal also says, if more centers are opened like Chhatrasal Stadium then we will get more talent and there will be a spurt of medals
 tippaniyan Officials of the wrestling association say that neither the state governments nor the corporate sector is ready to help the sport
 aise main buniyadi str par inhen ab bhi bahut dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Surprisingly, the game has failed to attract the corporate sector and glamor even after the spectacular success
 bhartiya kushti sangh kaa kahana he ki vah jor to laga rahaa he lekin uskaa jor ab bhi kam pad rahaa he
 Amit Kumar and Bajrang Punia won the medals in freestyle in the first World Championship of Wrestling in Hungary kaayam kiye
 Then Sunil Yadav of Banaras surprised everyone by winning India's first medal in the greco-roman category
 yah or baat he ki in sabake baavjood bhartiya kushti sangh ek maamuli sammaan samaaroh main rajat padak vijeta amit kumaar ko paanch lakh rupee or kaansya padak vijeta bajrang puniya or sandip yadav ko teen-teen lakh rupee hi de paaya
 Wrestling Association President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh says, what should we do more than this
 hamaare paas paise hi nahin hai
 Such an event also costs nine-ten lakh rupees
 ye hi bahut mushkil se kar pate hai
 Amit Kumar and Bajrang Punia, who have won medals at the World Championships, wrestle their wrestling skills under the direction of Mahabali Satpal at the Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi
 bhartiya kushti main zyaadaatar kamyaabi haryana or dilli ke pahalawaanon ke zariye aa rahi he
 However, players and officials emphasize that the bench strength of the Indian team is good
 dabl olympic padak vijeta susheel or landan olympic main kaansya padak vijeta yogeshwar kehete hai ki ab sabhi wet category main achche pahalwaan hai
 So our bench strength is good, but they all believe that more wrestling centers are needed in the country
 mahabali satpal bhi kehete hai, chhatrasaal stadium jaise or bhi centre khulen to hamen or bhi tallent hasil hoga or padakon kii jhadi lag jaaegi
 The comments kushti sangh ke adhikari kehete hai ki na to rajya sarkarein or na hi corporate sector is khel kii madad ke liye taiyaar he
 In such a situation, they are still facing a lot of problems at the basic level
 hairaani kii baat he ki shandaar kamyaabi ke baad bhi ye khel corporate sector or glamer kii apni ore khinchne main naakaam rahaa he
 The Wrestling Federation of India says that it is pushing, but it is still falling short

 The first Test match between India and New Zealand starts on September 22 at the Green Park ground in Kanpur
 team india apane cricket itihaas kaa 500waan muqabla khilne ke liye utregi, to bhartiya cricket ke liye yah behad khaas match bhi he
 It is not difficult to predict if the match is an Indian pitch, so the spinners will dominate here
 green park maidan par khele gaye test kaa itihaas sakshi he ki yahaan purv main khele gaye maichon main bhartiya spinners apana varchasv banaate rahe hai
 That is, once again, the spin trio of Team India playing under the captaincy of Virat will have their eyes on the performance of Ashwin, Jadeja and Amit Mishra
 1976 main bedi, chandrashekhar, raghavan ne nachayagreen park stadium main bharat or newjiland ke bich yah teesraa test hoga
 Despite the century of opener Glenn Turner in the first innings of the first match between the two teams in 1976, the Kiwi batsmen struggled against Indian spin trio Bishan Singh Bedi, BS Chandrasekhar and s Venkataraghavan
 in teenon ne aapas main chah wicket liye
 In the second innings too, all three kept New Zealand's top order batsmen tied with their spin
 haalanki puchhlle kiwi ballebaajon dabliuke lij or di o’sulivan ne kisi tarah is test ko drow karne main kamyaabi paa lee
 In 1999, Jumbo, Turbanator, Joshi had 16 setbacks, followed by New Zealand in the captaincy of Stephen Fleming in 1999 for the second time in front of India at the Green Park Stadium in the industrial city known as Leather Capital
 sachin tendulkar kii captaini main ek baar phir bhartiya spinners is test match main haaavee rahe
 Anil Kumble, the current head coach of Team India then took over the reins of the Indian invasion and performed brilliantly
 match main kumble ne 10 wicket jatke or bhartiya team ne mahaj chaar dinon main hi newjiland ko aath wicket se parajeet kar diya
 Then the spin trio had two other bowlers Harbhajan Singh and Sunil Joshi
 bhajji ne chaar to joshi ne do mahatvapurn wicket liye
 That means 16 wickets in total went to the spin trio
 kohli ko viraat banaaegi aswin, jadeja, mishra kii tikdiviraat kohli or ken williamsan kii tiimon ke bich is maidan par 22 sitambar se hone vaale tisare mukaable main pichley do muqablon kii tulana main kuch alag nahin hone vaala
 Kohli also has a spin trio in the form of off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and leg-spinner Amit Mishra
 aswin apane 37wein test main hi 200waan wicket lene kaa karnama karne se mahaj saat kadam dur he aise main unase is test main joardaar pradarshan kii ummiden hai
 At the same time, he is fresh on his 31 wickets in four Tests against South Africa in the last home series
 isi siries main keval 17 test puraane ravindra jadeja ne bhi 23 wicket liye
 Amit Mishra is also no less than 20 Tests experience
 africa ke khilaaf us siries main mishra ne do test match khele the or liye to saat wicket the lekin do baar divilliars jaise ballebaaj ko bold bhi kiya
 So during this Test series, it also depends on the performance of the Indian spin trio in how many days the match will fold
 2012 main aswin ne liye the 18 wicketisse pehle aakhri baar 2012 main jab newjiland kii team bharat daure par ai to dhoni kii captaini main bhartiya team ne ross tailor kii team ko donon hi match main pachhad diya
 Ashwin and Pragyan Ojha shared 31 wickets among themselves during that two-match home series win by India 2–0
 aswin ne siries main 18 wicket jatke to ojha ne 13
 Kiwi team is also from the spin trio, equipped Kiwi captain Kane Williamson has expressed his apprehension about getting the spinning track during the series as well as reaching India
 yahi kaaran he ki kiwi team bhi spin tikdi se las hokar ai he
 Among his quirks are leg-spinner Ish Sodhi, orthodox off-spinner Mark Craig and left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner
 kotla par practice seshan ke dauraan unki spin tikdi ne kaaphi gendbaaji kii
 During this time a new ball was also handed to Mark Craig
 lihaaja, samajha ja saktaa he ki kiwi thimk tanks gendbaaji kii shuruyaat apane spinners se bhi karvaa saktaa he
 India has not won for 28 years New Zealand In addition to the loss to England in 2012-13, Team India has won seven of its eight home series in the last six years
 jabaki bhartiya pichon par newjiland ko keval do jeet mili he
 First in 1969 in Vidarbha and second in 1988 in Wankhede
 yani pichley 28 saalon se newjiland ko bharat main ek test jeet kii talash he
 Tests will also be played in Kolkata and Indore after Kanpur, but considering the Indian spin trio, the strong batting order and the great cricketer of cricket in the form of captain Kohli, the Kiwi team will have to wait for an absolute victory
 ranking main number-1 banegaa bharatbharat or newjiland ke bich teen test maichon kii yah siries team india ko test ranking main bhi number-1 par le ja saktaa he
 By winning the four-test series 2–0 in the West Indies, Kohli's army has been ranked number-2 in the ICC Test rankings
 donon tiimon ke bich yah test siries 12 oktober ko khatm ho rahaa he
 a day after that, i
e
 from October 13, the Test series between Pakistan and West Indies will begin
 is bich koi anya desh test nahin khelenge
 This means that with the start of the series with a win, the possibility of India once again reaching the top in the Test rankings will prevail

 ' kammings ne kaha, 'saalon ke dauraan bade paimaane par maamle aane par badi sankhya main logon ko aspataalon main bhartee karaane kii jarurat padati he or swasthya vyavastha choti pad jaati he
 'this study is published in the journal PNS

 sena kaa record rakhane vaali shakha ne singh kii janmatithi 10 may, 1951 darshai he, jabaki sainya sachiv kii shakha ke record main yah 10 may, 1950 darj he
