 ab yah kahani bhi khulegi ki abu hamaja ko bhagane main kisne madad kii thi? Indian Mujahideen and lashkar-e-taiba terrorist Abu Hamza had been living in Saudi Arabia for the past 15 months
 maharashtra ke bid main rahane vaala abu hamaja saudi arab main pakistan ke passport par rah rahaa tha
 For the past several months, three officials of India's intelligence agency were keeping an eye on Abu
 uski pahchaan ke liye khufia agency ne bid se uske gharavaalon ke blad sample liye jiske jariye diene test hua or abu kii pahchaan kar lee gai
 Significantly, Abu Hamza's clue was given during interrogation by Lashkar terrorist Lal Baba Mohammed Sheikh who was caught in connection with the Pune blasts
 usee ne zabiuddin kii aawaaj pahchaan kar bataaya tha ki yah 26 / 11 main shaamil abu jindal he

 At the same time, Pak High Commission has said on the issue of Abu Hamza, terrorism is a problem for both countries
 iskaa muqabla donon desh milakar hi kar sakate hai
 Pakistan has once again reiterated its support in this field
 tippaniyan Abu's arrest also matters because its capture will also make it clear how terrorists are operated from the control room of Pakistan

 Now this story will also open up who helped Abu Hamza to run away? sunrisers hyderabad ke mukhya coach tom mudi ne kaha ki pratibandhit australian opening ballebaaj david warner ke baahar hone kaa team par maamuli asar padegaa
 Moody believes that he has a balanced team, so that the former captain will not miss
 sunrisers hyderabad ko niyamit captain warner kii jagah newjiland ke captain ken williamson ko kaman saunpny padi
 Because this Australian former vice-captain was dropped by BCCI from IPL 11
 mudi se jab poocha gaya ki bahut jaldbaaji main liye faisle se captaini main aae is badlaav kaa kya asar padegaa, to mudi ne patrakaron se kaha, ‘ bahut kam, aap se sachai bataa rahaa hum
 Our team is very balanced, with a lot of players who can play different types of roles within the team

 videsh yatraaon ke kharch or bank main jamaa rakam ke anivaary khulaase sareekhe vivaadaaspad or bojhil praavdhaanon ko ab hataa diya gaya he
 New provisions have also been added, but in a much simpler form
 may main jo form jari kiya gaya tha, usamen kii gai sakht khulaason kii maang ke vyapak virodh kii vajah se use waapas le liya gaya he
 People were against disclosing detailed information about their foreign travels and bank deposits
 nae form main vistrut khulaase kii maang to nahin kii gai he, phir bhi aapaki videsh yatraaon or bank khaaton ke bare main buniyadi jaankaree maangi gai he
 For example, instead of asking how many foreign trips you made last year, the new form only asks for your passport number
 jaankaar kehete hai ki passport number ke jariye ab yah pataa karne kii jimmedaari iskar vibhaag kii hogi ki us shaks ne aisi yatraaon par kitni rakam kharch kii he
 The intention is to catch tax evasion and curb black money going out of the country

 comke sah-sansthaapak or nideshak sudhir kowshik kehete hai, ''har saal kuch na kuch badlaav kiye jate hai, jo karadaataaon ko chakkar main daal dete hai
 Many tax notices are sent due to incorrect selection of ITR form / invalid return
 '' itiaar form main or bhi kai badlaav hue hai
 To help you understand these changes, here is a guide: New Form (ITR2A) Given that many taxpayers do not have any capital gains while owning more than one house, the Finance Ministry has simplified the process
 a new form of ITR-2A has been proposed
 yah form un vyaktiyon yaa hindu avibhajit pariwaron (echuef) ke liye he, jinke paas do makaan hai, lekin puunjigat laabh, vyavsaay / peshey se yaa videshi sampatti / videshi aay se koi aamadani nahin he
 Taxpayers have to choose from six types of tax forms and identify and choose their correct ITR form based on the source of their income
 videsh parisampattiyaan, aay, agle laabh se ghaataa purti sareekhee kuch or baaten hai, jinhen apana sahi itiaar form chunane se pehle dekhnaa hota he
 If the salary, pension or interest is the only source of income and there is only one house as property, then such person has to fill the ITR-1 tax form
 jin vyaktiyon or hindu avibhajit pariwaron ko ek se adhik makaan se aay or puunjigat laabh praapt hua he, unhen form itiaar-2 bharne kii jarurat he
 The new form ITR-2A is for individuals or Hindu undivided families who have no capital gains and who own more than one house
 itiaar-3 vyavsaay se aamadani praapt karne vyaktiyon / echuef ke liye or itiaar-4 swarozgaar main lage vyaktiyon ke liye he
 Passport number: The good news is that now you will not have to give detailed details of your foreign travels or expenses incurred in the Income Tax Department
 lekin agar aapke paas passport he, to uskaa number ab bhi itiaar-2 or itiaar-2e main aapako dena hi hoga
 Experts say that this is a mere show off because the Income Tax Department can still get the details of your foreign visits from the Immigration Department

 ke chif innovations officer vikram ramchand kehete hai, ''saadhaaran karadaata ke liye phikr kii koi baat nahin he, magar jo log saal main paanch yaa chah baar videsh jate hai or in yatraaon main gaiyr-hisabi dhan kharch karte hai, ve jarur pareshaan honge
 Earlier it was a weakness that many people took advantage of
 '' ek or kadam yah uthaaya gaya he ki aise vyakti ko, jo bhartiya naagarik nahin he lekin vyavsaay, rojgaar yaa chaatr vija par bharat main rah rahaa he, use videshi sampatti kii jaankaree dene kii jarurat nahin hogi, basharte usne sambandhit pichley varsh ke dauraan aisi sampatti se koi aamadani arjeet na kii ho
 Before the bank account details, you used to give details of only one bank account for the purpose of refund
 ab se aapako pichley varsh ke dauraan kisi bhi samay sanchalit apane sabhi bank khaaton ke byore dene honge
 You have to provide all current / savings account numbers and IFS codes
 is nae praavdhaan se tex-purti prakriya main paardarshita aegi
 Ramchand says, "it's a good move, because most people have multiple accounts
" karadaataaon ko ab apni duusari aamadaniyon kaa bhi zikr karnaa padegaa, jo ve apane duusare bank khaaton main praapt karte hai
 "under the new provisions in ITR-1, people who have exempted income (other than agricultural income above Rs 5,000) without any sealing can now fill in Form ITR-1 (sahaj)
 vyaktiyon / echuef ke liye bhi form-4 (sugam) ke sandarbh main aise hi saral upayon kii peshkash kii gai he
 Another step has been taken that any resident, who is earning income from outside India or who has a financial interest outside India, is not allowed to file income tax returns in ITR-1
 itiaar-vipahle online ritern file karne ke baad aapako uski pavati yaa itiaar-ve alag se iskar vibhaag ko post karne kii jarurat hoti thi
 Now if you give an Aadhaar number in your ITR form, then you will not need to post ITR-V
 tex maamalon ke jaankaar kehete hai ki yah badi raahat he kyonki kai log aksar pavati form iskar vibhaag ko bhejnaa bhul jate the
 Lastly, if you feel confusion or complication in filing your income tax return, seek the help of experts to avoid tax notices later and all goes well

 41 'one Direction' music band singer Harry Styles does not want to practice ballet, but instead of ballet, he adopts yoga instead of ballet
 website ‘femelfirst dot ko dot euke’ ke mutabik, ek tivi vaarta ‘da jonathan ross sho’ main styles ne kaha, ‘meri peeth main dard rahata he
 When i saw the orthopedic doctor, he asked me to practice ballet dance
 lekin maine baile nahin siikhaa
 Instead, i practice yoga

 The length of his one leg is half an inch more than the other leg, due to which he has pain in his back

 modi sarkaar naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak karegi peshloksabhaa main aasaan lekin rajyasabha main hogi chunautijediu, YSR, TRS or shivasena ke rukh ahm hamodi sarkaar naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak ko aaj loksabhaa main pesh karegi
 The Citizenship Amendment Bill proposes granting Indian citizenship to the Hindu, Jain, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Parsi communities of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan
 is vidheyak se muslim samudaay ko baahar rakhaa gaaya he
 All the opposition parties are opposing
 loksabhaa main bijepi ke paas bahumat kaa aakanda he
 In such a situation, it is easy to pass the bill in the Lok Sabha, but the real challenge of the Modi government is to be in the Rajya Sabha
 haalanki jediu, tiares, wiesar congress or shivasena aise dal hai, jinke rukh par bahut kuch nirbhar karegaa
 The BJP has a majority in the Lok Sabha, while the NDA does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 aise main modi sarkaar ko naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak ko paas karaane ke liye duusare dalon ke sahyog kii darkaar hogi
 However, in the last two years, the strength of the BJP and the NDA has improved in the Rajya Sabha
 iske alaava vipakshi dalon kii ore se bijedy or eiediemke jaise dal naagarikta sanshodhan bill par modi sarkaar ko samarthan kar sakate hai
 Explain that at present the total number of members in the Rajya Sabha is 239
 matlab ye ki agar sadan ke sabhi sadsy matdaan karen tobahumat ke liye 120 vot kii jaruratpadegi
 If we talk with NDA about those parties which can support NDA, then their potential number becomes 114
 inamen bijepi ke 83, bijedy ke 7, eiediemke ke 11 or akali dal ke 3 sadsy shaamil hai
 The way the Opposition has a stand on the 108 Voters' Amendment Bill, the government may face a tough challenge in the Rajya Sabha
 congress ke 46, tiemasi ke 13, sapa ke 9, sipiem or diemke ke 5-5 or argedy, ensipi or basapa ke 4-4 sadasyon samet baaki dalon ko milakar vipaksh ke paas kul 108 saansadon kaa samarthan hasil he
 The opposition may also get the support of some smaller parties belonging to the northeastern states that are opposed to the bill
 haalanki purvottar ke arunachal pradesh, nagaland or mizoram vaale rajya main inner line permit kii vyavastha se CAB ke daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 The stance of parties like JDU, YSR Congress and TRS will not be clear yet
 aise main sabase zyada najar inhen dalon par he
 However, it is unlikely that all three parties will vote against the government
 inke yaa to sarkaar ke saath vot karne kii sambhaavna he yaa phir ye matdaan main hissaa nahin lengi
 These three parties have a total of 13 mps in the Rajya Sabha
 vahiin, shivasena ne is bill par samarthan ke liye shart rakh di he ki vah tabhi saath degi jab 25 saal tak nai naagarikta paane waalon ko voting kaa adhikaar na diya jaae
 Shiv Sena has 4 mps in Rajya Sabha
 baharhaal, agar ye partiyaan endie ke saath jaati hai to sankhya badhkar 127 ho jaaegi jo bahumat se zyada he, lekin agar ye matdaan main bhaag nahin leti hai to bahumat kaa aankada 111 ho jayega
 At the same time, the only MP of Naga People's Party, a party from the Northeast, is also not likely to participate in voting

 Whether you believe it or not, it is true that the fruits and vegetables we eat for health are grown using a variety of artificial fertilizers and insecticides
 fasalon ko nuksaan se bachaane ke liye kisaan kheton main keet-naashkon kaa chhidkaav karte hai
 When these fruits and vegetables reach the market from the field, then some part of these insecticides is left in them
 uske alaava kai tarah kii ashuddhiyaan bhi isamen kai tarah kii duusari ashuddhiyaan bhi hoti hai
 These impurities cannot be seen with naked eyes
 aise main kai baar ham falon or subjiyon ke saath in ashuddhiyon ko bhi nigal lete hai jo ek vakt baad sharir ke liye nuksaandaayak sabit hone lagata he
 These insecticides start accumulating in the body and the amount of toxins in the body increases

 By cleaning fruits and vegetables in these ways, while you are safe from various diseases, their nutrients are not destroyed
 1
 With the help of vinegar, Sirka is one such thing that not only cleanses the pests present in vegetables and fruits, but also removes insect pests in a better way
 ek bade bartan main pani lekar usamen kuch maatra main sirka mila len
 Dip fruits and vegetables in it
 kuch der baad unhen halke haathon se malkar baahar nikaal len
 Then put them in a clean pot and use
 2
 With baking soda, cleaning vegetables and fruits along with baking soda is a good solution
 paanch gilaas pani main chaar chammach baking soda daalkar falon or subjiyon ko 15 minute ke liye is mishran main dubo den
 This will remove all types of impurities on their outer skin
 3
 You can also clean turmeric powder and vinegar with turmeric water, you can also clean fruits and vegetables with turmeric solution
 haldi main anti-bacterial gun paaya jaataa hajiski vajah se haldi ke ghol se falon or subjiyon ko dhonaa bahut hi acha mana jaataa he

 The brick-lined streets in Uldepur village of Ganganagar, on the road leading from Meerut to Bijnor, were witness to the caste struggle between Dalits and Thakurs
 meerut main 11 agast se shuru hui bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii pradesh kaaryakarini baithak ke thik do din pehle 9 agast ko hui is ghatana ne sattarudh dal ko darpesh chunautiyon kaa ehsaas kara diya tha
 These challenges are primarily to reconcile with other castes, strengthening the bjp's Dalit base
 khud ko dalit hitaishi sabit karne ke liye hi bhaajapa ne meerut ke subharti vishvavidhyalay parisar main shuru hui do divasiy kaaryakarini baithak ke kaarykram sthal kaa naam 1857 kii kranti ke shahid matadin valmiki ke naam par rakhaa
 Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's cutouts were prominently displayed at the venue along with former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and former Home Minister LK Advani

 Apparently, before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the glimpse of the bjp's agenda of applying caste equations in Western UP was clearing the cutouts and pictures of the leaders at the venue
 khud ko rashtrawaad kii sabase badi jhandabardaar bataane ke liye bhaajapa ne meerut kaa chunaav kiya, jahaan se angrejon ke khilaaf 1857 kii kranti kaa bigul foonka gaya tha
 In Meerut, the executive meeting started with a total of more than 600 workers, including BJP state functionaries, working committee members, district heads, district in-charge, forgetting the defeat in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana Parliamentary by-elections in the last few months in the state and coming out full force in the Lok Sabha elections
 Was resolved varsh 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main upi kii 80 sansadeey siton main se 71 siten jeetne vaali bhaajapa ne is swapnil pradarshan ko 2019 ke aam chunaav main dohraane ke liye ek baar phir jatiyon kii golbandi kii ranneeti taiyaar kii he
 Danger of Grand Alliance The BJP had to face defeat from Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate from Valmiki Samaj in Meerut in December last year
 iske baad pashchimi upi main kairana loksabhaa or nurpur vidhansabha upachunaav main bhi daliton kaa rujhaan basapa kii ore hi dikhaa
 Prior to the Lok Sabha elections, a possible grand alliance of Samajwadi Party (SP), BSP, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) has put the BJP strategists to sleep
 vidhansabha or loksabhaa upachunaavon main dalit-muslim gathjod apana asar dikhaa chukaa he
 To tackle this, the BJP has raised the issue of reservation in Aligarh Muslim University (AMU)
 kaarysmiti ke udghaatan satr main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne kaha, ''bhaajapa ko dalit virdohi kehane vaale bataaen ki aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay main anusuchit varg ko aarakshan kyon nahin mila? aise masalon par sabhi rajnatik dalon kii jubaan band kyon ho jaati he?''vipakshi gathbandhan kii kaat ke liye bhaajapa ne apane obisi card kii dhar tej karne kii taiyaari kii he
 For this, the party has relied most heavily on Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya
 maury ne pichhadaa varg ke bade chintak or bihar ke purv mukhyamantri karpuri thakur ke naam par har jile main sadak banane kii ghoshnaa kar party kaa agenda spasht kar diya he
 Maurya will now meet with those castes of backward classes including Gurjars, Sainis, Jats in western Uttar Pradesh who are politically neglected
 kaarysmiti main upi prabharee om maathur kii gaiyr-maujuudagi main bhaajapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv or rajyasabha saansad bhupendra yadav kii manch par maujuudagi akaaran nahin thi
 The party is contemplating handing over the responsibility of UP in-charge to Bhupendra Yadav to make a dent among Yadav voters
 ''hindutv ke saath sabakaa vikaas'' kaa tadakaapashchimi upi main kanvad yatra shuru hone par pehali baar mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kanvdipoon par helicopter se phool barasaa kar 'hardkor hindutv' kaa agenda saaf kar chuke the
 The State Working Committee in Meerut also reflected the Hindutva agenda
 kaarysmiti baithak ke baad upmukhyamantri keshav maury samet kai mantriyon ne meerut main baba oughadnath or dharmeshwar mandir pahunchakar puja bhi kii
 In order to indirectly sharpen the Hindutva agenda, Yogi stressed in his speech at the working committee that the BJP government would not appease anyone
 unka nishaanaa muslimon kii ore tha
 In order for his outright vote not to go to the anti-bjp coalition, the party has made a fresh formation of the minority front and is preparing to take it to the booth for the first time (see box)

 Amar Verma says, "the BJP is not going to get the Muslim vote, but by raising issues like triple talaq and halala, the party is trying to divide this vote bank
" ''inhen muddon ko lekar alpsankhyak morcha pradesh bhar main mandal str par kaarykram yojit karne ja rahaa he
 In Assam, the BJP is trying to create a 'cocktail' of nationalism and Hindutva by raising the issue of National Register of Citizens (NRC)
 kaarysmiti ke samaapan par party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha, ''desh main sharnaarthi to rah sakate hai lekin, bangladeshi, pakistani yaa phir kisi ghuspaithiye ko nahin rahane diya jayega
 "BJP will hold district executive committee meetings in all districts and prepare public opinion on NRC issue
" sanghathan par jorapradesh main bhaajapa kii sarkaar banane ke baad se party ne pehali baar sabhi prakoshthon, morchon, vibhaagon or prakalpon kaa nae sire se gathan kar loksabhaa ke chunavi samar ke liye apni sena taiyaar kii he
 All Front Presidents are assigned targets (see box)
 kaarysmiti main upi ke sabhi party saansadon or kendriya mantriyon ko nyotaa bheja gaya tha
 The absence of Union Minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Sultanpur MP Varun Gandhi at the Meerut Working Committee meeting indicated that all was not going well within the party

 In order to cut the grand alliance, Amit Shah gave the slogan 'ek Booth, 20 Youth' in UP

 During the next two months, the party will accelerate the election campaign through programs like Shaheed Samman Samaroh, Prabhat Pheri, Kavi Sammelan

 *** kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne apane sabhi kaarykram radd kar aanan-fanan main nagpur pahunch gaye hai
 It is believed that political activities have intensified a day before the deadline to form the government in Maharashtra and sources say that Nitin Gadkari will meet Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat in Nagpur
 gadakari ne bhi NDTV se baatcheet main kaha he ki vah nagpur ja rahe hai jahaan vah maharashtra ko lekar unki mulaakaat kuch logon se hogi
 Let us tell you all this is happening at a time when a delegation of CM BJP is going to meet the Governor of Maharashtra Bhagat Singh Koshyari today
 nitin gadakari kaa naam bhi maharashtra ke mukhyamantri pad ke lekar chal rahaa he or kaha ja rahaa he ki vah shivasena ke saath jari gatirodh ko khatm kar sakate hai
 Sources say that Shiv Sena leader CM Devendra Fadnavis is very angry with the attitude which has openly rejected his 50-50
 isse pehle devendra fadanvis bhi sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat se mangalvaar ko mulaakaat kar chuke hai
 On the other hand, Shiv Sena Sanjay Raut has denied the news of meeting or talks of Sangh Chief and Shiv Sena Uddhav Thackeray as incorrect
 
 The thing to note here is that while Shiv Sena tells Devendra Fadnavis as 'outgoing chief minister', the party has been soft on Nitin Gadkari
 nitin gadakari pehle bhi maharashtra main shivasena-bijepi sarkaar main mukhyamantri rah chuke hai or vah shivasena ke sansthaapak bal thakare ke bhi kaaphi najadik rahe
 Along with this he also has good relations with Uddhav Thackeray
 isse pehle shivasena kishor tiwari ne mohan bhagwat ko chitthee likhakar kaha tha ki shivasena or bijepi ke bich jari vivaad ko sulajhane ke liye nitin gadakari ko kaha janaa chahie
 Let us tell you that in the results on October 24, BJP got 105 seats and Shiv Sena got 56 seats
 gathbandhan ne bahut kaa 145 kaa aankada bhi paar kar liya he lekin shivasena ne 50-50 formule kii maang kar di he jiske tahat dhai saal shivasena kaa mukhyamantri rahegaa or dhai saal bijepi kaa
 But CM Devendra Fadnavis clearly said that the post of CM will remain with Shiv Sena for the whole five years

 " film and televijan institute of india (FTII) ke nae chairman ke niyukti ke din hi 47 chaatro ne prashasan ke khilaaf maas bycott karne kaa nirnay liya he
 After Gajendra Chauhan, with the appointment of actor Anupam Kher to the post of FTII chairman, the controversy has started to appear once again
 asal main duusare varsh me padhane vaale paanch chaatro ko FTII se nishkashit kiya gaya he or teen dinon ke bheetar hostel chhodkar campus se baahar jane ko kaha gaya he
 The rest of the second year students have also been given notice of the action
 ye puraa vivaad second year ke chaatro ko dialog vaali short film banane ke liye teen din ke bajaay sirf do din die jane par shuru hua he
 Second year students have to make a ten-minute short film in a group of five, for which these students were given three days earlier, but now the FTII administration has decided to give only two days for this exercise
 chaatr iskaa virodh kar rahe hai
 On Monday, the administration called five students for a meeting to discuss the shooting, but the students decided not to go to this meeting together
 second year main kul 47 chaatr pard rahe hai
 All these students have decided to oppose the decision of the administration of FTII
 iske baad FTII ke prashasan ne meeting ke liye na aane vaale pehle gut ke paanch chaatro ko restricket karke teen dinon ke andar hostel chhodane kaa aadesh diya he, to baaki chaatro par bhi karwai karne ke notice de die gaye hai
 But all the 47 students have decided to boycott mass against the administration
 is maamle main FTII diarector yaa faikalti members main se koi bhi baat karne ke liye uplabdh nahi the
 Regarding the appointment of actor Anupam Kher, former chairman of FTII Students Council Muthu told Aaj Tak that Anupam Kher is a part of the network of RSS and this government, and the values they are trying to eliminate
 khuleam prachaar bhi karte rahete hai anupam kher
 a lie always treats the big lie

 Asif within a few hours of Osama bin Laden's death
 jaradaari sarkaar ne paraspar virdohi bayanon ke jariye osama kii haddiyon se pakistan kii vishwasaneeyata ko dafna diya
 There was also no decency to change them according to the emerging facts
 shaayad pakistan maanata he ki chunki vah ranbhumi ban chukaa he, lihaaja yuddh ke kuhase main ghabrahat ek jaij chaal he
 As the brilliant doctor of human nature, Shakespeare said, when we go out to deceive, we weave a very complicated net
 jaradaari kii sarkaar ke liye maukaparasti swaabhaavik rup se aa jaati he, or shuru main uskaa ghutana jaani-pahachaani disha main muda, unhone apni peeth thapthapa lee
 His people rushed to the television studios to announce that Osama was killed in a "joint campaign", the highest pride of a "prolonged" war against terror
 landan or washington main uske rajdoot media main mashkkat karne lage
 In London, Wajid Shamsul Hassan made a false boast to the BBC, which would not have been allowed from headquarters: Osama was brought to Abbottabad a few days ago to lure him into the trap
 lekin siie ke nideshak leone paneta ne is kaalpanik katha kii dhajjiyaan uda deen: ''yah tay kiya gaya ki pakistaniyon ke saath kaam karne kii kisi koshish se mishan khatre main pad saktaa he
 They can alert the target
 '' duusari ore, white house main counter-terarysm ke pramukh jon briken ne saarvajanik taur par kaha, ''yah soch se pare he ki osama kisi saport system ke bina itane lambey samay tak rah saktaa he
 "they could not be more forthright: the US believed that if Islamabad had been informed of the proposed attack, it would have helped its dependent, Osama, to flee to another refuge
" siie ko maaloom tha ki osama abtabad main pakistan kii sabase ahm sainya academy kii naak ke neeche us ghar ke banane ke samay se hi, kareeb paanch-chah saal se rah rahaa he
 It was as easy as knowing the result of the addition of two and two
 oonchi deevaaron or contile taron vaala vah vishaal ghar vishesh rup se osama ke liye banwaaya gaya tha
 By Monday evening, Zardari was forced to believe that his representatives were lying, and that "the events of Sunday were not a shared campaign
" '' baad main shaayad gharelu tabakon ke dabaav main unhone america par pakistan kii samprabhutaa kaa ulanghan karne kaa bhi aarope madha
 Here comes a thought: sovereignty can be violated only if you have protected it
 jaradaari ne jaan-boojhkar ek bada sawaal nazarandaaj kar diya jis par ab ho-hallaa much rahaa he
 ISI is not a stupid organization
 use yah kaise nahin pataa tha ki vaanchhiton kii duniya kaa sabase mashhoor cheharaa, ek aatanki jisane america ko ek bada yuddh (jisaki maujuuda keemat prati din 30 karod dollar he) chhedane ke liye uksaaya, apni biviyon, ek darjan bacchon or sahyogiyon ke saath paanch saal se bhi zyada arase se uske daravaaje par rah rahaa he?agar islamabad ko maaloom hi tha, jaisaa ki kuch log ab daawa kar rahe hai, to pakistan ne americanyon ko osama ke thikaane kaa pataa lagane or uske nattejey jhelane kaa intjaar karne kii bajaae sabase vaanchit aatanki ko giraftaar kar uske khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kaa apana saarvbhaum adhikaar kyon chhod diya? is vichaar main dher sari sambhaavnaaen hai
 If Salman Taseer's murderer was welcomed and praised in Lahore with rain petals of rose, how much praise would Osama give during the trial? Pakistan could pay its national debt by levying entry fees
 jab aap jhooth bolte hai to chimati donon ore se sikud jaati he
 Truth is not complicated
 ghar ke rakh-rakhaav se jude kuch saamaanya sawaal iskaa khulaasa kar denge
 The youngest child from Osama's last (pakistani) wife is two years old, and thus he is born in Abbottabad
 ve doctor koun the? kya uske ek darjan bachche skool jate the yaa unhen nijee taur par shiksha di jaati thi? ve tutor koun the? kya bachche kabhi ghar se baahar nahin nikle? ve kahaan gaye? unhen galle ke liye paisa kaise miltaa tha?kisi sthaneey bank ke khate se to nahin miltaa rahaa hoga? bijli or pani ke bill koun chukaata tha? nakad yaa check se bhugtan kiya jaataa tha? osama gurde kii beemaari kaa marij tha, jaisaa ki parvej musharraf ne 2002 main pushti kii thi
 How did he get treatment? It is hardly a long list but it is enough to prove that someone in power, it is very likely that the ISI would have given Osama help and protection
 america ke paas islamabad par bharosa na karne kii saikadon vajahen hai, or isse nikat bhavishya main sambandh bighad jaaenge
 Barack Obama was merely president before he killed Osama; Now they have become the leaders of their country
 unhone shanti ke liye nobel puraskaar ko jaij tehra diya he, jise unhone badi bevakoofi ke saath tab le liya jab unhone ise hasil karne ke liye kuch nahin kiya tha
 But winning creates just as much scope for making mistakes as losing
 osama samasya kaa sabase zyada sadanwaala pratik maatr tha or vah samasya pichley dashak main bad gai
 The real danger is not from individuals or groups, but from the ideology that has penetrated deep into Pakistan and Afghanistan, and is emerging as parties like the Taliban: a medieval interpretation of theocracy through which power in both Kabul and Islamabad Attempts are being made to grab and contaminate the surrounding areas

 unki pehali patibaddhta un hataash or niraash ho chuke yuvaaon ke prati hogi, jinhone unhen aitihaasik janadesh diya or jo unhen mukt bazaar or joshili udhyamita ke purodha ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate hai
 They have said many times that they know what poverty is and they have gone through the experience of getting out of that condition
 lekin bharat ko badalanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 The new Iron Man of India has inherited an economy whose growth rate was 8 of 2003-04
 2 fisadi se gir kar 4
 It is reduced to 9 percent
 use aisi naukarshahi kii madad se prashasan chalaanaa he jise upie-2 kii jadta se jhakjhorna hoga
 Above all, he must keep distance from the staunch elements of the Sangh Parivar who think that the time has come to recover everything
 unka abhiyaan bhi saral tha
 Now the question is what to do for those foot soldiers who worked hard for them
 vipakshiyon se unhen madad nahin milegi, alpsankhyakon ke khaase bade hisse ko unke udai main aresas ke hindu raashtra ke adhure agenda kii purnataa kaa khatra dikhataa he to mukhar or prachand vaktaaon ko modi abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke liye khatra najar aate hai
 Modi has to reach them all, just as he has been reaching his political rivals ranging from Keshubhai Patel to LK Advani
 unhen yah bhi sabit karnaa hoga ki acchhee bauddhik kshamta ke saath-saath bhaavnaatmak paripakvata bhi unamem bharpoor he, sakht mizaaj hone ke saath-saath ve komal hriday bhi rakhte hai
 He is also bringing a lot of administrative experience with him, he will be the first Prime Minister who has experience of holding the reins of the state for 12 years
 aise desh main jahaan sangheey dhaanche ne itane prahaar jhele hon, uske liye yah acchhee baat he
 And anyway, the country is in the cacophony of their "good days are coming" slogan
 centre main bahari shaksahashie par rahane vaale vyakti ke dard ko usase behatar koun jaan saktaa he, jisane kai varsh vahaan bitaye hon
 But Modi is not just an outsider to the Delhi Durbar, either spatially or geographically
 ve saamaajik drushti se bhi bahari hai jo yahaan ke angreji bhashi, abhijaat varg main sahaj nahin ho paaenge
 Nor will we be able to assimilate the unwritten rules of the game on which a person participates in crimes in public but in private life, will Modi be able to adopt the transaction through the back door? Will Modi tolerate those who molest the family of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the first campaigner to be in power? Many argue that the 2014 general election was an argument between two ideas of India - an idea that celebrates secular India that celebrates diversity , The second was of a divided India that worships uniformity
 modi ne is bahes ko ek tallent sho main badal diya, jahaan pratibhashali bharat kaa saamana samantvaadi bharat se tha
 The Congress could not say anything in its resistance because Modi had already shoved the ground from under his feet, accusing him of blocking development, especially the nehru-gandhi family, for nurturing a culture of freebies
 satta main aane ke baad bijepi kya dhara 370 ke prati patibaddhta, ram mandir nirmaan or samaan naagarik samhita laane kaa vichaar tyaag degi? kya modi pathyapustakon ke jariye bharat ke itihaas ke punarlekhan ke sangh ke dabaav se batch paaenge? ve bharat ke aarthik agenda ke bare main faisla lene denge? arase se sangh prekshak or america ke state department of south asia divijan ke purv pramukh walter anderson kaa maananaa he ki aresas modi kii majboot shakhsiyat se utana hi bhaybheet he jitne ki kai udaaravaadi
 He says, "modi is a man who takes his own decisions
" upar ke padaadhikariyon main dar he ki kaaryakartaaon kii vafadari aresas kii apeksha modi ke prati zyada he
 He believes that Modi may have problems with BJP rightists and the Sangh Parivar
 praveen togdipha jaise logon se unhen nibatna hoga
 The big question is, how will he be the Prime Minister? Unlike the image of having all the powers in their hands, they can and will share power, but they expect loyalty and tangible results
 angreji ke jane-maane varisht patrkaar jon iliyat kehete hai ki modi ko sirf netritv karne ke liye nahin balki kuch karne ke liye chunaa gaya he, ‘‘bharat ko nai nitiyon kii jarurat nahin he
 It needs decisions
 ’’ unka maananaa he ki yah baari badlaav kaa sanket he
 Fans of Modi's corporate world will communicate worldwide and dispel doubts about India

 How will India's oldest party deal with its worst ever defeat? Its previous record of defeat has been shocking
 1977 kii haar ke jatke ne indira gandhi ke jujharu vyaktitv ko saamne laa diya tha
 In 1989, the denial of voters forced Rajiv Gandhi to go among the voters by running a smokeless campaign but a brutal suicide squad killed him

 But going to Andhra Pradesh by hand is only part of the story of defeat
 ek anya kaaran he, satta ke teen centre-kamjor pradhanmantri, sonia gandhi kii kam hoti upasthiti or khud se hi baat karne main mashgool rahane vaale rahul gandhi
 Then there was the question of taking credit for the achievements of the government
 raajnneeti vigyaani joya hasan kaa kahana he ki shrey lene kii is ladaai main antat sarkaar ko shrey diya hi nahin gaya
 As far as Kejriwal's AAP is concerned, he should not be ashamed of his audacity
 bade naamon par aarope lagaae, bhrashtachar par prachaar kendrit rakhaa or bijepi tathaa congress main samanta ginate rahe
 If the Congress does not show enthusiasm for sitting in the opposition, it can emerge as a party that will assure accountability in public life
 lekin sarkaar chaahe jitani bhi hathdharmi ho, bharat main loktantr ko panpane ke liye aakraamak vipaksh jaruri he
 Now when Narendra Modi takes over the difficult responsibility of running this huge country, he will realize that the dimensions of expectations of this great country are the same as his victory, that is, Virat and Vishal

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented his 5th budget in Parliament for the fourth year of the Modi government at the Center
 is bajet ko jahaan modi sarkaar ne garib, kisaan, dalit, adivasee or vikaas ke path par aage badhane vaala bataaya
 However, a new health plan like Modicare was also mentioned in Jaitley's budget speech
 lekin maujuuda bajet sambodhan se kuch aise shabd gaayab najar aae, jo har bajet main pramukhataa se sunne ko milte the
 Black money Even before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi made black money stashed abroad a big issue
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan modi kalaadhan waapas laane ke vaade karte rahe
 After the formation of his government at the center, the first budget was laid in Parliament, then black money remained at the center of discussion
 haalanki, guuruuvaar ko bajet pesh karte hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaledhan ke khilaaf ladaai kaa desh ko phayda pahunchane kaa zikr jarur kiya, lekin is par zyada focus nahin dikhaa
 Announcements have been made about new trains in every budget of the new country
 maanav rahit crossing, nai line, steshnon par suvidhaon, train ke andar suvidhaon kii har bajet main ghoshnaa kii jaati he
 But the Finance Minister did not make any specific announcement regarding the new train in this budget
 hameshaa kii tarah is baar ke bajet main vishesh rooton par nai train chalaane kaa koi elaan vitt mantri ne nahin kiya he
 However, the Finance Minister made announcements such as the closure of new rail lines, more than 4000 human crossings, running trains on only major lines and the construction of 700 new rail locomotives this year
 niveshhar bajet main section 80-C kaa zikr rahata he
 Even before the Modi government, new announcements have been made under this section in the budget of all governments
 lekin maujuuda bajet main is par focus nahin kiya gaya he
 In this series, the government has also announced no change in the income tax slab
 nivesh or bachat kii kuch skims ko iske tahat shaamil kiya gaya he
 You get a tax rebate on investing in these schemes
 iskaa matlab he ki aap agar is section ke tahat tex chhot ke liye yogya skims main nivesh karte hai, to aapako ek tay seemaa tak koi kar nahin bharna padegaa
 At present, you 1 under this section
 5 lakh rupee tak kii kul chhot hasil kar sakate hai
 There has been a lot of discussion of the Modi government's earlier budget regarding tax evasion
 lekin maujuuda bajet main iskaa zikr kam hi najar aayaa
 However, Arun Jaitley did mention the increase in tax collection
 sasta mahangaakya chijen mahangi hongi or kya sasti, ise lekar bajet main hameshaa focus rahaa he
 But in the current budget, only two-four items which were expensive due to increase in custom duty came in the discussion
 jabaki bajet ke dauraan rosemara jindagi se judi chizon kii badi list ke mahange or saste hone kii ghoshnaa hoti rahi he
 This time the tax on excise duty and goods has come under the purview of GST
 yahi vajah he ki aapako is baar bajet main sasta-mahangaa dekhne ko nahin mila he

 When you install any app in your smartphone, it demands some permission
 aise hi yah ap bhi he jise install karte vakt kuch parmishan maangata he
 When installing apps, they usually ask for the permissions they need
 lekin agar koi ap aapse aise parmishan le jisaki jarurat us ap ko nahin he to hairaani jarur hogi
 When installing the applause, you are asked for your complete contact list

 The Uber app is also a great example of integrating app permissions

 In this, such permission was being taken from the users which was quite surprising
 kyonki ubar ne aisa opshan rakhaa tha jiske tahat agar yujar ubar nahin yuj kar rahaa he phir bhi customers kii lokation trek hoti rahegi
 The report has also received a response from Jan al-abedin, the founder of Saraa App
 unhone kaha he ki yugerske contacts ko aane vaale samay main hataa diya jayega
 In the coming time, a feature called Found Your Friends will be launched and that is why the permission of contacts has been taken
 pratikriya ke baad unhone da intercept ko bataaya he ki jis partner ke saath wo kaam kar rahe the ab ve uske saath kaam nahin karte or wo is ap se yah feechar hataane vaala tha lekin galati se aisa nahin hua
 However, he also said that now this function has been removed and Prahada does not keep any contacts in its database
 aapako bataa den ki ap store or google play store par zyaadaatar ap aise hai jinhen install karte vakt yugers se aisi parmishan bhi maangi jaati he jisaki jarurat us ap ko nahin hoti
 But when they are asked why this permission is being taken, then they say that it is your wish if you do not give permission
 haalanki zyaadaatar eps bina khaas parmishan ke kaam hi nahin karte, isliye majabuuran unhen install karnaa hi hota he
 jain-al Abedin has told in the conversation to date after this news that the contact request will be removed from the next update
 hamane is maamle par sibar security jaankaron se baatcheet kii he
 He has told that many times apps also take such permission from you which they need later
 haalanki ap install karne se pehle aapaki screen par ye dikhataa he ki wo ap aapse kya parmishan letaa he
 Saraa app has done the same

 fain ekta kapur se request kar rahe hai ki wo surabhi jyoti ko waapas lekar aaen
 One user wrote - i am very excited for the show, please bring Surabhi Jyoti with Veps
 to duusare ne likhaa ki suribh jyoti main lead main chahie
 It will be heartwarming to see who will play the actress' serpent
 bataa den ki nagin first or second sijan main mauni roy ne kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 His acting was highly liked
 haalanki, film kamitment kii vajah se mauni third sijan nahin kar pain
 And Surabhi Jyoti replaced her
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke kareebi maane jane vaale digvijay singh par us vakt yah aarope laga tha ki goa main congress kii sarkaar banane ke liye unhone choti partiyon se baatcheet karne main dhilaai barti
 In comparison to this, BJP showed success in forming the government by contacting other smaller parties after getting less seats from Congress
 jet airways ke dobaaraa udaan bharne kii ummid ab lagbhag khatm hoti najar aa rahi he
 Passengers are troubled by expensive air fares after the jet stops operating
 vahiin company ke karmchaaree naukari jane or niveshak bazaar main paisa doobane se pareshaan hai
 There are reports of talks between Jet's lending bank and the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund to start arranging funds to run Jet
 haalanki bazaar visheshgy jet ko kharidaar na milane ke baad company kii vaapasi kii ummiden dam todatii najar aa rahi hai
 Elder officers left, Those sitting in large positions are also leaving the jet
 company ke siio vinay dube, siefo amit agarwal, sipio rahul taneja or secratory kam complins officer kuldeep sharma ne mangalvaar ko company kaa saath chhod diya he
 Even before this, many executives of the company have resigned from their posts
 nahin mila koi kharidarjet kii nilaamee ke liye mangai gai boliyon main kisi bhi company kii ore se ruchi nahin dikhaai gai
 Etihad has also conditioned to write off debt on behalf of banks to invest in the company
 aise main karj main dubi airlines ko philhal koi bhi kharidaar milanaa mushkil najar aa rahaa he
 Jet's stock may have seen a spurt in a few sessions due to reports of heavy losses to investors, whether bidding from a buyer or if SBI was given money to run the jet, but Jet Airways shares in the last one month It has seen a fall of Rs 138 per share
 mutual fund companiyon ne jet ke share main baari bikwaali kii he
 This makes it clear that even the market experts have now given up hope for revival of the jet
 iske alaava jet ke slot ko bhi anya airlines ko baanta ja chukaa he or lambey samay tak udaan na bharne kii sthiti main jet kaa license cancel hone kaa bhi khatra mandara rahaa he, jo shaayad jet ke diwalia hone kii aakhri pushti hogi
 *** punjab ke mukhyamantri amarinder singh or tiruvanantpuram ke saansad shashi tharur un netaaon main shaamil hai, jinhone priyanka kaa samarthan kiya he
 Amarinder Singh said on Monday that Priyanka Gandhi would be the right choice, but the decision has to be taken by the Congress executive
 unhone kaha, 'priyanka agle adhyaksh ke liye ek shandaar vikalp hai, jinhen sabhi kaa samarthan milegaa
 i agree with Shashi Tharoor that his natural charisma will inspire activists and voters alike
 aashaa he seedblusi is par jald faisla karegaa
 'priyanka Gandhi is fully active against the BJP government of Uttar Pradesh
 vah har roj mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke khilaaf hamale bol rahi hai
 According to many leaders, the party is losing money due to the delay in the appointment of the executive chairman, who is currently devoid of president
 netaa na hone se logon ke man main andeh paidaa hua he or haikaman se rajya netritv ko spasht dishanirdesh na milane ke kaaran hi congress ek mahatvapurn dakshini rajya karnataka ko ganvaa baithi he
 But those who are supporting the stand not to appoint a member of the Gandhi family as executive chairman, believe that the party should support Rahul Gandhi's stand
 netaaon kaa yah khemaa maanata he ki rajasthan ke upmukhyamantri sachin payalat or madhya pradesh ke netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya maujuuda paristhiti main party ko netritv dene ke sahi vikalp hai
 Mallikarjun Kharge can be made the executive chairman by an agreement and Pilot and Scindia can be the two vice presidents
 lekin rahul ko yah formula bhi sweekaar nahin he
 Sources said that the name of Karnataka's veteran leader Mallikarjun Kharge has come up rapidly, because he speaks Hindi very well and can walk all classes together
 netritv sankat samaapt karne ke liye seedblusi kii baithak agle saptaah ho sakati he
 Till now the meeting could not be held because Rahul was in America
 rahul ke waapas lautne ke baad congress ke kai netaaon ne unase nae sire se apil kii ki ve apane nirnay par phir se vichaar karen, lekin unhone logon se kah diya ki vah apane nirnay par adig hai
 Meanwhile, the party's elderly leaders are trying their best to persuade Sonia Gandhi to persuade Priyanka
 lekin rahul gandhi iske puri tarah khilaaf hai
 Rahul is theoretically not against Priyanka, but because she believes that there should be such a churn in the Congress to end her dependence on the family
 pakistan ke piem nawaz sharif ne kaha he ki kashmir ke kaaran bharat or pakistan ke bich kabhi bhi chauthi jang ho sakati he
 He asked for the matter to be resolved soon
 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki bharat ke hisse vaale kashmir ko azaad dekhnaa unka sapana he or unhen aashaa he ki yah unke jivan kaal main puraa hoga
 According to Pakistani newspaper Dawn, Sharif said that Kashmir is an issue due to which there can be a fourth war between the two countries armed with weapons
 sharif pakistan ke kabje vaale azaad jammu or kashmir (ageke) council ke bajet seshan main bol rahe the

 The statement said that the Prime Minister's dream is that Occupied Kashmir be free from India and expressed his wish that this dream come true in his lifetime

 aakhri gend tak pataa nahin chalata ki vijeta koun banegaa
 In the five T20 World Cups so far, there have been many matches which immersed the audience in the ocean of adventure

 The breath of the people of both countries was stopped
 joginder sharma ke aakhri over main misbah ke ek galat shot ne match pakistan se chin liya or bharat kii jholii main daal diya
 Pakistan required 13 runs in the last over, and had just one wicket
 pehali do gendon par saat ran banane ke baad misabah ne joginder kii chauthi gend par wicket ke peeche shot maar diya, jise srisanth ne kaich kar liya or pehla vishwa cap team india ke naam hua
 3) Australia vs Zimbabwe, 2007 The World T20 was first played in 2007 and in this very first edition, the Zimbabwean team showed how adept it was to rearrange
 50 overon kaa world cap paanch baar jeet chukiaustralian timis formet main ulatpher kaa shikaar ho gai

 The Kiwi team, chasing just 129 runs, could manage only 127 in 20 overs despite being 5 wickets in hand
 kiwi team ke liye ye haar bhi kabhi naa bhul paane vaali haar rahi
 6) Australia vs Pakistan, the second semi-final match between Australia and Pakistan in the 20102010 World Cup has exceeded every level of thrill
 ek samay lagbhag haar ke kagaar par khadi australia ne is match ko aise jeeta ki kisi ko bharosa hi nahin hua
 At one time, Australia needed 48 runs from 18 balls to win, and only three wickets were in hand
 aise samay main mistar cricket mike hasi ne maatr 24 gendon main 60 ranon kii pari khelkar ek gend shesh rahete hi team ko 192 ranon ke lakshya tak pahunchaa diya
 Australia needed 18 runs to win in the last over

 7) West Indies vs New Zealand, the match between West Indies and New Zealand reached the Super Over in the 20122012 World Cup group match

 ) Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Saturday once again targeted former Deputy Chief Minister and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav and said that RJD is now a sinking boat, which no one wants to ride
 susheel modi ne kaha ki bihar main endie puri tareeke se ekajute he or milakar loksabhaa chunaav ladegi
 In fact, a few days ago, Tejaswi Yadav claimed that the leaders of NDA constituent Hindustani Awam Morcha and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party are feeling suffocated in the alliance
 hindustani awam morcha ke rashtriya adhyaksh or purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi or rashtriya lok samta party ke netaa or kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha ko ofer dete hue tejasvi yadav ne kaha tha ki agar yah unhone to NDA kaa saath chhodkar argedy ke saath aana chaahate hai to unka swaagat kiya jayega
 Tejashwi had also claimed that the central government could hold the Bihar Vidhan Sabha elections along with the Lok Sabha elections to be held next year

 Describing Rahul's angry remarks as disrespectful to the country and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the BJP chief said that Rahul should have formally called for the withdrawal of the ordinance instead of publicly condemning it
 rajnath ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "adhyadesh ko faad dene kii baat kahkar kya vah araajaktaa failaana chaahate hai? vah pradhanmantri ke swadesh lautne kii pratiksha kar sakate the or unase kehete ki yah adhyadesh upyukt nahin he, isliye ise waapas liya jaae

 " ladies
 
 abhivadan aap apane hisaab se ajum kar len, sabase pehle to bataa den ham koun hai
 We come from a generation that does not really know how many men tortured women first, why or how they did it? We are not part of it, so there is no guilt, no, we have not agreed
 dalit-damit-ablaa vagairah sunne main hi bada pathetic feel dete hai or ‘purushpradhan samaaj’ yaa ‘pitru satta’ jaise shabd hamaare akzam main do-do nambar kii vettege rakh ke aaen tab bhi ham uskaa arth na bataa paaenge
 Then there was more talk of becoming a part of it
 ham us peedi se aae hai jinke liye bacchiyaan,ladkiyaan yaa auraten hauvva nahin thim
 i mean you were always there for us
 bagal vaali bench par nursery main hamaare saath hi tiffin khaaya karti thim
 Those girls with pink tiffin never got angry
 ham half pant pahanakar jate wo tunic
 At that time, there was more class of mam than people
 acchhee hoti thim unako sab aata tha daantati bhi kam thim
 Sometimes Mummy would leave instead of Mam
 ek jaisi to hi hoti thim
 The whole class smiled and smiled
 kaisaa to bhi lagata tha
 That is why we can never think that women are just sitting in the house
 phir bade hue hamaari pant lambi hui gulabi tiffin vaali ladkiyaan skirt main aa gayi
 Even now she eats tiffin
 wo tiffin khaatin ham mojey kii gend se kahin gippi-gend khel rahe hote
 The only difference was that now, if they had been killed in front of them, then the feeling would be more
 bhuule ja rahe the
 
 
 Happy Women's Day, Women's Day is truly a wonderful day
 matlab thik he, hona chahie auraton ke liye bhi ek din
 Only one answer from the General Knowledge is prepared
 fasebuk par kaichi apadats aate hai
 Whatever the world may be like in the rest of the day, on that day it seems to be divided into two camps
 ek wo jinhen lagata he ki har saal ladkiyaan top bhi sirf isliye kar jaati hai kyonki copies mam check karti hai ladakiyon ko zyada number de daalati hai
 If they just go, then the girls, girls and women from all over the world should come under seven cellars
 inhen ladakiyon ke hansane-bolne, padhane-likhane, seekhney-samajhane or sabase khaas faisle lene se bhi dikkat hoti he
 Others for whom women empowerment means women have a bottle in one hand and a cigarette in the other
 inke anusaar duniya kii sari auraten tab tak shashakt nahi hai jab tak ladakon jaise khule main cigarette nahin peetin
 Unmarried mothers are not made
 das-das bwoyfrends nahin banaati
 Understand that women are free to make their own decisions when they start making their own decisions as they say
 aise logon ko narivivaadee kehete hai
 We do not want to be diplomatic, but everyone knows that nicotine is bad for everyone
 aadaten buree hon to mummy dost badal daalane ko kah detii hai
 The rest of daru-beedi or girlfriend-boyfriend is not a big deal and is not synonymous with empowerment at all
 har kisi ke dimag main apni kahani chal rahi he yakeen maniye aapke sivaa kisi ko fark nahi padataa aap kitni pi sakati hai yaa aapke kitne bwoyfriend hai
 It is good to fight but not with a shadow
 bura lagata he jab puure samooh main lapetakar hamen bhi lampat-tharaki yaa balaatkaari tehra diya jaataa he
 It is expected that they will bow their heads and say, many even accept it
 ye unki charitrik durbalata he unke liye ladakiyon kaa genes pahan lenaa hi bavaal hota tha par ham nahi maanenge
 We know how to take a stand
 galat ko galat kahana aata he, ghatiya nonvej jokes padhakar ghin aati he, bra kii strip dekh hamaara comarya nahi bhang ho jaataa, sleeveless top or saadhe chah inch kii skirt dekh hormones nahi fadafdane lagate, ladki ko ladke kaa haath pakad kejate dekh hamaari putaliyaan chaudee nahin hoti hamane hameshaa se apane aas-paas ye sab dekha he
 Now the difference has stopped, these are common things
 
 As common as ours or yours
 ham badi gajab peedi se aate hai hamaare canvas vaale juuton ke upar mummy ke kehane par baandha kaala dhaagaa hota he
 So on Women's Day it's good that you guys are around us, mummy-aunt-mam-girlfriends, neighbors-hitchhiker-coworkers in any form
 bahut sundar hoti hai aap sab
 Your handwriting is good
 aap log atension siking nahin hoti hai, ham aapaki barabari nahin kar sakate par aapako kuch special treet bhi na karenge
 Because that's all it really needs
 aap to samajhati hai

 ' It has been 4 years since Narendra Modi has been in power at the Center and many of the breathtaking promises he made in 2014 with historic victories were to make the Ganga clean and clean
 satta sanbhaalane ke baad bhi modi ne svachh ganga kaa vaada doharaaya, lekin 4 saal guzar jane ke baad bhi ganga kii sthiti main khaas sudhaar hota nahin dikh rahaa
 After coming to power, PM Modi said that to save the city and culture, the Ganga river needs to be cleaned first
 maa ganga chaahati hai ki koi aisa betaa to aae jo use is gandagi se baahar nikaale
 In the beginning, it was seen that soon after coming to power, the Modi government swung into action on cleaning the Ganga
 ganga safai ke liye alag se mantralay banaaya gaya, jisaki jimmedaari uma bharti ko di gai
 An action committee was also formed, which included veterans like Uma Bharati Alawanitin Gadkari, Prakash Javadekar, Piyush Goyal and Shripad Naik
 ganga kii safai se jude abhiyaan kii shuruyaat to sarkaar ne tufaani andaaj main kii, lekin guzarate vakt ke saath yah yojana bhi dharaatal par aane ke bajaae mahaj bayanon or baithkon main hi simatati dikhi
 It has been 4 years since the Modi government came to power and 3 years since the Namami Gange scheme started, but what is said about the improvement in the situation, many projects related to it have not even been approved
 mahaj 15 fisadi hi kharchasarkari aankade bhigangaki safai se jude maamalon kii bhayavahata darshaate hai
 The government started its campaign on May 13, 2015, approving the Namami Gange program for cleaning the Ganges
 gujarey 3 saalon main is yojana ko 4,131 karod rupee die gaye, lekin safai ke liye aavantit (20 hajaar karod) raashi main se ab tak mahaj 15 fisadi yani 3,062 karod hi istemaal ho sake
 a total of 2,953 million tonnes of garbage is discharged daily from 2,525 kilometers along the Ganges, passing through 97 cities in 5 states of the country, and the present day is that 1,369 million liters of garbage falls every day in the Ganges, a symbol of faith in Hinduism
 Used to be
 pavitra nadi kii safai to dur abhi bhi isamen girane vaale kachare main koi giravat tak nahin ai he
 Delay in projects The government kept talking about cleaning the Ganges in between, but there is no significant improvement in the situation in the ground
 ganga nadi ke kinare bane ghaaton kii safai or river front ke vikaas ke naam par 65 projects main se sirf 24 hi puure ho sake hai
 The CAG report states that out of 154 projects related to the cleanliness of the Ganges, only 71 were approved
 duusari ore, ganga ko maili hone se bachaane ke liye 46 sivej treetment plant banaae jane hai jinamein 26 kaa kaam deree se chal rahaa he
 Money was not spent in rural areas; The condition of Ganga falling in urban areas is not only bad, but there is no significant improvement in the situation in rural areas also
 gaanvon main ganga kii safai ke liye jari kiye gaye 951 karod main se mahaj 490 karod rupee kaa hi istemaal kiya ja sakaa he
 It is not that there was no success in this mission
 pradhanmantri modike sansadeey kshetra varanasi samet ganga kinare faile ghaaton ko svachh kar diya gaya he, lekin maili hoti nadi or isamen girane vaale kachare main kami nahin laai ja saki he
 People on the banks of the Ganges allege that people engaged in cleaning through the Namami Gange scheme are cleaning only at the upper level
 ganga kii safai kaa jimmaa dekh raheen uma ne daawa kiya tha ki pavitra ganga 3 saal main nirmal ho jaaegi or agle 7 saal main aviral ho jaaegi
 But even before this came true, in September last year, Uma Bharti took charge of this ministry and handed it over to Nitin Gadkari
 ganga abhiyaan 3 dashak se bhi puranamodi sarkaar kii ore se 'namaami gange' ke liye aavantit kii gai raashi pichley 3 dashak main centre kii ore se kharch kii gai raashi se 4 guna zyada thi
 Before the coming of the present government, by 2015 nearly four thousand crores have been spent on cleaning the Ganges in the last 30 years
 1986 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ne 462 karod rupee kii laagat vaale 'ganga ection plan' ko manjuuri dete hue ganga kii safai kaa abhiyaan shuru kiya tha
 The main objective of this campaign was to prevent the river from getting polluted and to improve the water quality

 About two lakh employees of other companies have also joined it

 Krunal says that the Dalit leaders who supported the BJP should have developed their own society, but the Dalit leaders in the NDA government have remained silent on the atrocities on their society
 vahiin athavle is virodh ko sajeesh qaraar diya
 This whole incident happened in front of media cameras
 republican party of india ke netaa ramdaas athavle ne kaha ki gujarat chunaav main sameekaran isliye gadabad ho gaya kyonki hardik patel ne apane samaaj ko gumraah kiya or congress kii taraf jane ko prerit kiya or isi vajah se bijepi ko nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 Explain that the BJP suffered in the 2017 elections as compared to the previous assembly elections
 ramdaas athawale ne kaha ki rahul gandhi piem banane ke sapane dekh rahe hai, magar congress satta main nahin aegi
 Rahul Gandhi has done well in Gujarat, the reason is Hardik Patel
 mantri ne yah bhi kaha ki agar hardik patel ko apane samaaj ke liye aarakshan chahie to unhen narendra modi kii endie sarkaar kaa saath dena chahie
 Regarding Jignesh Mevani, the mentor leader to Jignesh Mevani, Ramdas Athawale said that he should do good politics
 oona andolan ke baad unhen vidhayak banane kaa mauka mila he or unhen koshish karen ki vah naksalwadiyon kaa saath dete hue najar na aaen kyonki baba sahab kii vichaardhaara main ye nahin aata he
 Union Minister of State Ramdas Athawale on Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who is preparing to fast for the victims of the fast, said that he has democratic rights
 magar pichley 60 saalon main dalit samaaj kitna salaamat rahaa he? dalit samaaj par raajnneeti karnaa acha nahin he
 What Congress did for the Dalits under its rule, Rahul Gandhi has the right to advise the government, but what will happen with the fast
 imphal main chah saal pehle hue farji muthbhed ke aaropee 35 varshiya head kanstable hirojit singh ne apana gunaah kabool kar liya he
 Singh has said that in July 2009, at the behest of a senior officer, he opened fire on 22-year-old Sanjit Singh and Sanjit was unarmed at that time
 angreji akhbaar 'rindian express' main chhapi khabar ke mutabik yojanabaddhath tareeke se kiye gaye farji muthbhed kaa pehali baar khulaasa karte hue hirojit ne sweekaar kiya he ki piples librasion army kaa sandigdh samaj jis sanjit par goli chalaai gai thi, vah us samay 'nihattha' tha
 The order to end it was given by Jhalajit Singh, the additional SP of Imphal West at that time and currently the SP of Imphal West
 saathi pulicekarmiyon ne kaha tha sanjit ne chalaai he golius din ke ghatnakram ko yaad karte hue hirojit ne bataaya ki use khaanaa khaataa samay police wireles par massej aayaa tha, jisamen jaankaree di gai thi ki bir ticendrajit park ke paas muthbhed ho chal rahi he
 Moving towards that place, he was told by some policemen that on his stop, Sanjit drove his team to Pargoli
 unke kehane par sanjit se baat kii gai
 Then a call came on his mobile, in which a man was talking about saving him
 adishnal espi ne kaha tha- khatm kar do usehirojit bataate hai, 'tabhi adishnal espi vahaan pahunch gaye maine unhen sari baat bataai jiske baad unhone mujhe sanjit khatm kar dene kaa aadesh diya tha
 After which i went and killed him with six or seven spheres
 phir police vaale aae or uskaa shav le gaye
 ' girish karnad kii kuch antim maarmik chhaviyaan un pratirodh sabhaaon se banati hai, jahaan vah kabhi 'main bhi urban naksal' or kabhi 'note in maai nem' kii takhti lagaakar pahunche dikhaai padate the
 At the age of 80, in the midst of his ever-growing physical ailments, he would have traveled long distances to these gatherings, not because he had a passion or passion for any immediate political resistance, but because of the plurality, diversity and freedom
 He considered the value of Indian consciousness, he was seriously aware of the increasing danger on it
 lekin girish karnad kaa asli mol in pratirodh sabhaaon se kahin bahut bada he
 In his plays, the questionability of Indian consciousness is seen at its peak
 myth or itihaas ke upkarnon kaa istemaal karte hue vah samakaleen yatharth se muthbhed karte hai or saamaajik-raajnneetik vidmbanaaon par bahut maarmikata se anguli rakhte hai
 a drama with complex narrative and structure like 'hayavadan' is rare not only in Hindi or Indian languages but in the theater of the world
 is naatak main vah ek saath kai dwandvon kii ore ishaara karte hai - mastishk or deh kaa dwandv, manushyata or pashutaa kaa dwandv, prem or samarpan kaa dwandv or antat ishwar ke saath manushya ke rishte kaa dwandv
 Similarly, in 'tughlaq' he sees from many angles the power and public relations, the decadence of court culture and the tragedy of a shattering country under the pretext of an ambitious ruler swinging between generosity and cynicism
 'rakt kalyaan' main vah kavi vasavanna kii katha uthaate hai or phir satta or abhivyakti se jude kai prashn uthaate hai
 Of course, Girish Karnad also had a reputation as an actor in Hindi films
 you
 R
 ananthamurti ke upanyaas 'sanskaar' par bani film main unhone praneshacharya kii bhoomika nibhaane ke saath filmi kariyar kii shuruyaat kii
 In the parallel cinema that developed in the '70s, he appeared in many important roles
 'nishanth' or 'manthan' main unki bhoomikaayen ab bhi yaad kii jaati hai
 It was his natural acting ability that he continued to get rich roles and recognition in commercial films too
 nai peedi shaayad unhen 'ek tha tiger' jaisi filmon ke zariye yaad rakhegi
 But then one has to reiterate that Girish Karnad's real value lies in his contribution to the theater
 jise ham bhartiya bahulata kehete hai, vah bahut sachche arthon main jin madhyamon main vyakt hui he, unamem rangamanch bhi rahaa
 In the '60s,' 70s and '80s, a number of playwrights suddenly emerged simultaneously in languages like Hindi, Marathi, Bangla, Kannada, which received All India acceptance and appreciation
 hindi se mohan rakesh, dharmaveer bharti, lakshminarayan laal, shankar shesh, marathi se vijay tendulkar, mahesh alkunchvaar, bangla se badal sarkaar or shanbhu mitra, or kannada se girish karnad or bav karant jaise rangakarmiyon-naatakakaron ke naam lagaataar dhyaan aate hai, jinhone aise naatak likhe, jinhen unki bhashaaon ke baahar bade paimaane par khelaa gaya
 Of course, Mohan Rakesh, Dharamvir Bharti, Badal Sarkar and Girish Karnad look different and bigger than their other contemporaries
 girish karnad kaa janaa is silsile kii aakiri kadi kaa tut janaa he
 Girish Karnad was constantly active and more vocal than any other contemporaries
 vah bahut nirbhikta se apni baat rakhte the or amuman aalochanaon kii parvaah nahin karte the
 a few years ago, he called Rabindranath Tagore a second-rate playwright, so many fans of Tagore were hurt and disappointed
 isamen shaq nahin ki karnad kii tippanee main ek atirek tha, lekin yah baat bhi asandigdh taur par maani ja sakati he ki gurudev apane upanyaason main, apane vaicharik lekhan main or apane geeton main jitne bade hai, shaayad apane katipay krantikari kathankon ke baavjood apane naatakon main nahin
 Girish Karnad may have been hinting that Tagore's plays might have been left behind due to the artistic complexity and spread of modern theater
 baharhaal, karnad ab nahin hai
 His departure in this period makes something more sad
 hamaare samaaj main sankeernata badi he, prashnakulata ghati he, myth or itihaas ab adhyayan, anveshan or vishleshan ke vishay nahin rah gaye hai, ve ghatiya raajnneeti ke upkaran bhar rah gaye hai
 The value of power has increased, the sense of vengeance has increased and the tendency to consider the other as an enemy has increased
 aise samay main vah aadmi chalaa gaya he, jo abhivyakti kaa mol samajhataa tha, itihaas or myth ko apane chashme se dekhne kaa saahas rakhata tha or rachanaatmak taur par behad urvar tha
 Although Dharmveer Bharti's 'andha Yuga' is the finest creation of modern Indian theater in Girish Karnad's own opinion, Girish Karnad's own plays show how deep the creations of a composition can be, how the threads of culture and tradition can be threaded in it
 And how their time can be understood through them

 The public food that feeds the food in the capital may soon take the form of a canteen
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke kehane par dilli doylog kamishan ne ek prastaav dilli sarkaar ko bheja he
 Currently, the government is claiming to serve pure food for 3 to 5 rupees as soon as the scheme is implemented
 dilli ke kareeb 30 se zyada jagahon main milane vaale jan aahaar par jald hi taala lag saktaa he, lekin iske badale aapako milegi 'aam aadmi canteen'
 As soon as the Aam Aadmi Party comes to power, at present, the Sheila Dixit government's plans are under crisis
 dilli dialog kamishan ne khud mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke kehane par 19 june ko ek prastaav dilli sarkaar ko bheja he
 The idea came from Amma's canteen, the Aam Aadmi canteen was studied by the Delhi Dialog Commission on the lines of Chennai's famous Amma canteen, after which these things have been placed in front of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 isamen ek canteen banane kaa kharch kareeb 10 lakh 15 hajaar rupee he, dilli sarkaar pehle phej main 10 se 15 canteen kii shuruyaat kar saktaa he
 This will be the menu of the common man canteen along with the Delhi government is talking about keeping the maximum price of food in every canteen up to 5 rupees, which includes Pudi, Bhaji and Ethics in the morning
 dopaher ko daal-chaaval or raat ke liye roti, sabji or daal hogi
 The Delhi government is planning to build more than 200 canteens in the capital
 canteen dilli sarkaar ke khaali pade daftaron ko chunaa jayegacanteen ke liye dilli sarkaar ke aspataalon ke alaava khaali pade sarkari daftaron ko chunaa jayega, lekin yahaan bhi sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki jitani sankhya main canteen banaae jane kaa prastaav he usamen didie se judi jameen kii jarurat pad sakati he, jo ek pareshaani kii vajah ban saktaa he
 Aam Aadmi Party's plan to remove mass food from the streets is so clear that the Delhi government is considering removing public food from the streets of the capital
 agar is yojana par dhyaan den to shuruyaat main mahaj 15 rupee main paushtik khaanaa dene kii baat sarkaar ne kahi thi, lekin rajdhani ke kai mukhya aspataalon or sarkari daftaron ke baahar 18 rupee main logon ko khaanaa dene vaala jan aahaar ab ek thali main 6 puri, daal or ek sabji hi de paata he, jabaki raite ke liye 5 rupee alag se dene hote hai
 On the one hand the Delhi BJP is preparing to cross the electoral stalemate, while on the other hand there is a lot of suspense among the mps
 suspence is baat par he ki aakhir party is baar tikat degi yaa nahin
 An example of this started only when the party announced to make an extension for the election summer in Delhi
 iske liye shart thi ki jo bhi loksabhaa prabharee yaa vistaarak banegaa, wo loksabhaa chunaav ke liye tikat nahin maangega
 According to party sources, many big leaders had refused to become expansors as they feel that this time the party can give tickets
 sutron ke mutabik bijepi taiyaariyon ke saath saath dilli bijepi ke saansadon kaa report card bhi taiyaar kar rahi he
 This work is being done at 3 levels
 sutron ne bataaya ki party haikaman third party se saansadon kaa feedback taiyaar kara rahaa he
 Also, full details are being taken through the Namo app
 report card ke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki ise dilli kii chunaav prabharee nirmala sitaraman taiyaar kar sakati hai
 Looking at the Lok Sabha elections 2019, tickets will be decided based on the popularity of mps, their perception among the public and the work done in their constituency
 bijepi se jude sutron kii maane to yah report card tay karne main madad karegaa ki aane vaale chunaav main kis maujuuda saansad ko tikat diya janaa chahie or kise nahin
 This plan can be very important to beat Aam Aadmi Party and Congress
 donon partiyon ne alag alag chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 According to sources, Delhi bjp's election in-charge Nirmala Sitharaman and co-incharge Jaibhan Singh Powaiya will try to take stock of the preparations from the party workers and take stock of their views
 iske liye sidhe-sidhe kuch nahin poocha jayega balki iskaa feedback har sansadeey kshetra ke kaaryakartaaon, vistaarakon or loksabhaa prabharee se lene kii taiyaari he
 It has started in West Delhi but due to the death of former Defense Minister George Fernandes, Sitharaman could not attend the meeting
 buudhvaar ko ve uttar pashchimi or chandani chowk main camp karengi
 The mps from these areas are Udit Raj and Harsh Vardhan
 sitaraman har loksabhaa kshetra ke kaaryakartaaon ke saath kai baithak karengi jiske baad feedback party haikaman ko dena he
 BJP is trapped in the whirlpool of anti-incumbency, while there is restlessness inside the mps
 lekin in sabase alag bijepi taiyaariyon main koi kor kasar nahin chhodana chaahati
 It is too late for Deepawali, but in view of the Lok Sabha elections, BJP will celebrate the Kamaldeep festival in Delhi
 iskaa matlab he dilli main jitne bhi shauchalay bane hai yaa gharon main banaae gaye hai, vahaan ek din camel kaa deep jalaayaa jayega
 Also, all the workers are required to put lotus imprint flags in their homes
 haalanki dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne report card kii baat ko khaarij kiya he or kaha he ki saansadon ke feedback jaisi baat nahin he balki nirmala sitaraman harek loksabhaa kshetra ke kaaryakartaaon, loksabhaa prabharee or vistaarakon se party kii taiyaariyon kaa jayja lengi

 The Election Commission considered the reply given by the Department of Revenue as rude, in which the Commission had advised the Department that any action taken by the enforcement agencies like its Income Tax and ED during elections should be fair and non-discriminatory
 rajasav vibhaag ne jo or jis andaaj main jawaab diya, uski chunaav ayog ko apeksha nahin thi

 is naate apane chunaav main lage adhikariyon ko kalaadhan istemaal hone kii soochna par karrwai karne ke liye kahen
 This thing has come true to the Commission

" ” is baithak main haalanki sangh or bijepi ke netaaon kii chote-chote samoohon main anaupchaarik charchaaen jarur huin, jisamen tay hua ki goa kii tarah is baar laalkrishna adwani ko alag-thalag rakhane kaa sandesh nahin janaa chahie
 Under this strategy, he tried to convince him till the last time Modi's name was announced, but was not successful
 13 sintabar kii der shaam sansadeey board ne modi ko loksabhaa chunaav ke liye pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya
 After the sangh-bjp coordination meeting, all top leaders of the Sangh and BJP, including Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat, met Advani separately
 lekin unke ade rahane or sansadeey board kii baithak main aupchaarik virodh darj karaane kii manshaa dekh ekbargi rajnath singh ne board kii baithak ke bina hi modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karne kaa man bana liya
 He was instructed by the Sangh not to do so, because doing so would have clearly conveyed the message of BJP being divided
 lekin goa kii tarah hi is baar bhi modi ke naam ke elaan main adwani hissaa nahin bane
 He wrote a letter immediately after the meeting, objecting to Rajnath's style of work
 modi ne party ko kaise jeetaakhirkaar apane rajnatik sangrakshak adwani ke virodh ke baavjood modi ne party kaa ‘dilli kila’ jeet liya
 Recall December 2012
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main modi kii hetric ne achaanak desh kaa mizaaj badal diya
 Modi fought this election with the same message that this time the vote is to make him the Prime Minister, not the Chief Minister
 jeet ke baad kaa bhaashan unhone gujarati kii jagah hindi main diya or rashtriya muddon ko sambodhit kiya
 Modi's relationship with the Sangh was not better in the pre-election days
 bijepi main sanghathan mahasachiv rah chuke modi sangh parivaar kii ahmiyat kareeb se samajhate the
 So, he also started trying to remove the clout from the Sangh during the assembly elections
 unhen kamyaabi bhi mili
 In October 2012, he had a long meeting with Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat in Nagpur
 vahaan se nikalakar modi ne elaan kar diya, “sangh pramukh se meri mulaakaat faldaayi rahi
 By then, the Sangh had also started to realize that in the second generation of the party, Modi is the better option
 uski hichkichaahat thi to bas modi kii kaaryastylee ko lekar
 As a result of his style of work, Modi dwarfed the organization in Gujarat and his relations with local sangh-vhp leaders were bitter
 sangh se jude ek netaa kehete hai, “modi ahamkaari or akkhad jarur hai, lekin is vakt unke sivaa koi vikalp bhi nahin
 The Sangh Parivar has its own methodology, which can be controlled after coming to power
 ”gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main kendriya bijepi kii bhale koi bhoomika na thi, (tab modi or tatkaaleen bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari ke bich samvaad kaa bhi rishta nahin tha) lekin chunaav main jeet ke baad modi dilli aae to sabase pehle ashok road sthit party mukhyalay pahunche
 Modi reminded how he used to live in a small room in this office and whatever he is today, because of the party
 hameshaa gujarat ke vikaas or 6 karod gujaratiyon kii baat karne vaale modi ne apni brading kii ranneeti main bhi badlaav kiya
 Focusing on his criticism of the Central Government, he started talking about the development of 130 crore Indians
 soshal media ke badhate prabhaav kaa modi ne bakhubi istemaal kiya
 In the Chief Minister's residence, an MBA-IT specialist created an army of youths, who were strongly instructed not to talk to any leader
 in yuvaaon kii fouj twitor, fasebuk jaisi soshal site par brands modi ko pramot karne main din-raat juty rahati he
 With this strategy, when Modi became the talk of street corners, BJP first tried to convey the message by making him chairman of Central Election Campaign Committee
 party par modi kii jeet main sangh kaa bada yogadan he, lekin usase badi bhoomika brands modi ke rup main unka khud kaa projection he, jisamen korporate jagat kii bhoomika ahm rahi he
 In 2009, when Advani was the prime ministerial candidate from the BJP, the industrialists had advised Modi to project from the public platform
 isi tarah ke projection ne khaas taur se bijepi kaaryakartaaon main unki lokapriyata ko badhaayaa
 This popularity dwarfed the bjp's other contenders
 gujarat chunaav main hetric kaa swaabhaavik prabhaav modi ke kad par padaa
 On the other hand, bjp's patriarch Advani fell weak in the party itself and the mutual fight between Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley, the two top leaders representing the party in Parliament, made Modi's path to Delhi easier
 haalanki mauka dekh jetali dhire-dhire puri tarah modimay ho gaye jabaki sushamaa adwani ke saath virdohi kheme main ja milin
 Anna Hazare's voice was heard on Wednesday after a long time of self-deportation from the headlines of the news and Delhi
 77 saal ke buudhe sipaahi ne maharashtra ke apane gaanv ralegan siddhi main kaha ki ve apni cheli or magsese lig kii ek or saathi kiran bedi ke raajnneeti main jane par kuch nahin kahenge
 He also said that he will run the Lokpal movement on his own
 lekin kya vaaki aisa ho paaegaa?pmo kii bhul kii vajah se hui thi anna va kejariwal kii raahen juda!jawaab khojane se pehle jaraa peeche chalem
 The Lokpal was not a big issue then
 march 2011 main anna ne dilli aakar tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko suchit kiya tha ki lokapal jaldi laaen nahin to ve dilli main dharna karenge
 There were very few people in Delhi who took his words seriously
 uske baad chijen kaise badalin yah sabko yaad he
 In April 2011, fed up with the system and the situation, millions of people started seeing sparks of hope in Anna and his alleged team
 ‘main bhi anna, tu bhi anna’ kaa nasha desh par chaa gaya
 The government bowed down to him
 jaraa-jaraa si baat par ukhd jane vaali sansad is buudhe aadmi par charchaa karne ke liye ghanton baithi rahi or gambhir charchaa kii
 Everything kept going up
 lekin 2012 main anna kaa apane saathiyon par hi yakeen kam hota gaya
 After reversing the slogan of political synonym, Anna reversed from her talk two days later
 kejariwal and company ko raajnneetik party banane ke liye akelaa chhod diya
 Kejriwal went ahead by forming a party, Anna shrugged off after promising to do politics
 kejariwal kii raajnneeti paravaan chadhi to sabase pehle unhone ajtak agenda kaarykram main kejariwal kii jamkar ninda kii
 His words became so harsh that the silent and humble Kejriwal got the sympathy of the people in reverse
 lekin logon ne yahi mana ki anna kaa gussa bhavuk he, ve kejariwal se irshyaa nahin kar rahe
 But then the day also came when advocates of Anna Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress appeared
 or unke bharose jab mamata ne dilli main raily kii to khaali kursiyon kii soochna milane par anna vahaan nahin pahunche
 Mamta was drinking a sip of blood
 or log bhi sochate rah gaye ki anna itane duvidhamayi kyon hue ja rahe hai
 After this, Anna turned away from the cameras
 vakt badhata rahaa
 General VK Singh, who came down from his platform, also went to BJP and became an MP and then a minister
 ab kiran bedi mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaar hai
 People are understanding the path of Arvind, VK Singh and Bedi
 ye log apane iraadon ke liye aage bade ja rahe hai or jo sansad unki nahin sunati thi, vahaan pahunchakar ve apni kah rahe hai
 Anna is still keeping politics untouchable
 lokapal par bhi unki sakriyata kisi ko dikh nahin rahi
 By the way, it was also gradually revealed that Anna's strength was not in Anna's team, but Anna's strength from the team
 anna is baat ko kabhi man se kabool nahin kar sake
 His statement is reminiscent of Mahatma Gandhi's statement just before partition of India in which Bapu said- 'I will raise a new movement from the dust of India'
 ’ yah bayaan tab kaa tha jab nehru, patel, jinna koi bhi desh ke sarvocch netaa kii baat maanane kii sthiti main nahin tha
 It is possible that a great personality like Bapu would have shown this by doing this too, but in the 78th year of age, Gandhiji had accepted his team
 anna apane hath par ade hai or samay kaa pahiyaa kahin kaa kahin pahunch gaya he
 Once there was a crowd of thousands with Hazare, today he is alone
 lekin isaki jimmedaari aakhir unheen galat kadamon kii he jinhen uthaakar anna ne baad main peeche khinch liya
 Perhaps the soldier of the land of Sant Tukaram, this thing of Saint Kabir of Banaras has disappeared - half-a-minute he has turned back, he is in the world
 company secetrari kii sarvocch sanstha bhartiya company sachiv santhaan (isiesai) apane mahila sadasyon ko companiyon ke nideshak mandal main bhoomika sanbhaalane ke liye prashikshan kaaryakramon kii peshkash kar rahi he

 Addressing Shiv Sainiks in Goregaon area of mumbai, Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray announced that now the Shiv Sena will contest the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) alone
 is ghoshnaa ke kuch hi der baad pune main ensipi sharad pavaar ne is maamle main shararti pratikriya dete hue kaha ke itane saal ek saath kaam karne vaale alag hue hai iskaa mujhe bahut dukh ho rahaa he
 Sharad Pawar said his words but could not hide the laughter in his face, which makes it clear that the sadness is more due to the separation of Shiv sena-bjp on Sharad Pawar
 ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar se jab poocha gaya ki agar shivasena nemaharashtra sarkaarase apana samarthan waapas le liya to aapaki party kii kya bhoomika rahegi, is par pavaar hansate hue bole ki ve agar magar vaale sawaalon ke jawaab nahin dete, agar bijepi-shivasena is par koi nirnay lete hai tab isaki charchaa honi chahie
 Sharad Pawar may not be clear about his support or not, but it is also not hidden from anyone that the friendship between Sharad Pawar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is so deep
 2014 maharashtra vidhaan sabha chunaav ke turant baad, jab rajya sarkaar main satta ke bantwaare par shivasena-bijepi main tanaav tha us vakt ensipi ne bina kisi shart ke rajya main sarkaar banane ke liye bijepi ko samarthan dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The Shiv Sena's growing stature had diminished after this announcement
 iske baad shivasena vidhayakon ko mahatvapurn mantralay mili bina hi bijepi ke saath sarkaar main gathbandhan karnaa padaa tha
 Once again, bjp-shiv Sena has stood with bitterness in their mind at the same turn
 brihanmumbai mahanagar palika(biemasi) chunaav main seat bantwaare ko lekar donon partiyon ke bich pichley kai dinon se tanatani jari thi
 Out of the 227 seats of the BMC, the BJP was claiming about half the seats, while the Shiv Sena was determined to give it only 60 seats
 siton ke batwaare par koi nateeja nahin nikal paane par shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare ne khud ke dam par biemasi chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar diya he
 Apart from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in the state, elections for the municipal corporations of Pune, Nashik, Kolhapur and Nagpur are scheduled in the next month
 jaahir si baat he ki baaki chaar nagar nigam chunaavon par bhi iskaa asar padegaa
 But it will be interesting to see how much this rift caused by the allocation of seats in the BMC elections will harm the alliance of the two parties in the state government
 antarrashtriya olympic samiti (iosi) ne buudhvaar ko saaf kar diya ki bhartiya olympic samiti (ioe) jab tak nishpaksh or dobaaraa chunaav nahin karaata he, tab tak us par jari nilamban par punarvichaar nahin kiya jayega
 The IOC on Wednesday discussed the issue of suspension with the Indian delegation led by Union Sports Minister Jitendra Singh
 is pratinidhimandal main rashtriya khel sanghon ke sadsy bhi shaamil the
 Also, representatives of the Asian Olympic Committee (OCA) were also included in this bank
 iosi kii kaaryakarini ne chaar disambar ko ioe ko nilambit kar diya tha kyonki usne olympic charter kaa ulanghan karte hue ioe ke chunaavon main sarkari hastkshep ko badhaava diya tha
 The IOC took this step as a precaution
 iosi ne apane bayaan main kaha, ‘aaj kii baithak kaa mukhya makasad yah he ki ham nilambit ioe main nishpaksh evam taaja chunaav karaane kii sambhaavna khangaalana chaahate the
 We want the IOA to conduct a re-election which is completely democratic and transparent
 isamen kisi tarah kaa bahari hastkshep na ho
 Only then will the IOC reconsider its suspension decision against the Indian Olympic Association
 ’iosi ne kaha ki vah chahta he ki nilamban waapas lene kii dasha main ioe apni ore se jaruri kadam uthaae
 The IOC said, "the IOA should convene a meeting of its members to discuss its operational and ethical values
" iske baad ek aam baithak ho, jisamen olympic charter ke tahat nae or punarbhashit samvidhan kii sharton ke mutabik chunaav karaae jaaen
 The IOC said it would monitor the entire process and issue necessary guidelines for the IOA and its members
 baithak main shaamil khel mantri ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar iosi kii baton ko gambheertha se lete hue olympic abhiyaan kaa sammaan karte hue tamaam sharton kaa paalan karne kii koshish karegi
 Singh told the IOC, 'we will discuss this deeply before putting the Sports Bill on the table of Parliament
 is bare main sabase charchaa kii jaaegi
 Apart from sports federations, common man will also be consulted on this issue
 ham har kisi ke vichaaron kaa sammaan karte hue hi koi laabhprad kadam uthaaenge
 ' ise kehete hai bure dinon kii baangi
 Congress observer Manik Jagtap arrived in the area last week to recount the possible contenders for Osian seat in the next assembly elections
 yah seat marwar ke diggaj congressi maderna parivaar kii paramparaagat seat maani jaati rahi he
 But in the Bhanwari Devi case, Mahipal Maderna was marginalized due to his going to jail, and the family of his rival Badriram Jakhar rejected the claim, sprinkling salt on the burn
 paali ke saansad jakhad ne jodhpur kii purv jila pramukh, apni beti munni devi godara ke naam par daavedaari kii
 No such person from Maderna family reached the spot, but his supporters definitely raised their voices in front of Jagtap in favor of the family
 mahipal kii beti divya ne is ghatnakram par itnaa hi kaha, ''na to bade (parsaram) maderna saab ne kabhi daavedaari jataai, na hi chote (mahipal) maderna saab ne
 The party always gave the ticket as a true worker
 ''divya ne pichley dinon ek or sawaal uthaaya tha
 He asked Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who came to Bikaner to take good care of the organization and workers, why out of the 150 CBI sleuths, only his father's CD was fully known? It also gave the message that Maderna's granddaughter has to meet Rahul Gandhi in the crowd
 kya maderna naam kaa thappa ab alaakaman kii najar main bhi dhundhala ho gaya he? kai saare sawaalon kaa pulinda liye divya jawaab kii talash main bhatak rahi hai ki kyon unke pita ko siyaasi sajeesh kaa shikaar banaaya gaya?kehete hai ki raajnneeti main kab or koun palata maar le, kaha nahin ja saktaa
 The Maderna family is completely broken today
 haalanki divya apane pita mahipal ke jail jane ke baad se hi apane kai saare sawaalon ko media or janata ke bich oochaal-oochaal kar apane parivaar ke kile ko kisi tarah sanbhaalane kii koshish kar rahi hai
 But it is true that this family, now only Maderna, will have enough support to stand up again in politics
 siyaasi halkon main charchaa he ki mahipal kii patni lila yaa beti divya agar chunavi samar main kudane kaa faisla karti hai to unhen duusare ummidavaaron kii hi tarah mashkkat kerani padegi
 This family is definitely seven decades old in the politics of the state, but during the election tours, both of them will have to be repeatedly from the spots on the family
 vakt ne is kunbe ko bikher diya he, tabhi to chunavi saal hone ke baavjood parivaar abhi chupchaap baitha hua he
 Since 1952, this family has been putting a dent in the politics of the state
 parsaram maderna ke rajnatik jivan kii shuruyaat baldevaraam mirdha ke maargdarshan main hui
 He became the sarpanch for the first time in 1952
 iske baad 1957 main osiyaan se vidhayak or mantri ban gaye
 Senior Maderna, who remained in government with full status until the eighties, lost the election for the first time in 1985
 lekin chaar saal baad 1989 main phir bhopalgarh se jitkar aa gaye or pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh bane
 In 1993, when Bhairon Singh Shekhawat formed the government in the state, he was made the Leader of the Opposition
 1998 main unhen vidhansabha adhyaksh banane kaa avasar mila
 The political journey of his son Mahipal began in 1981, when he became the head of the Jodhpur District Council
 1988 or 1995 main phir unhone yah pad hasil kiya
 He became an MLA in 2003
 maujuuda ashok gahalot sarkaar main ve jaldaay mantri bane
 In 2011, his resignation was taken after the Bhanwaridevi episode was revealed
 jail main rahete hue hi kuch dinon pehle unhone jila sahakaari bank ke upaadhyaksh kaa pad hasil kiya
 His wife Leela has been a member of the Zilla Parishad for four consecutive terms and was recently re-elected as the unopposed chairman of the cooperative bank
 vahiin divya maderna ke rajnatik jivan kii shuruyaat pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main honi thi lekin unki umr isamen aade aa gai
 Later Divya started by contesting the Zilla Parishad from Osian, her father's constituency
 haalanki pradesh kii mukhya vipakshi party bijepi or duusare morche bhi maderna parivaar ko apane saath jodpha chaahate hai or yah baat congress bhi jaanati he
 Discussion was also on to eradicate Jhunjhunu MP Sheesharam Ola but the high command has tried to appease the Jat sections, angry with him and Gehlot, by giving him the post of minister at the Center
 aise main maderna parivaar ko bhi sibiai se kuch raahat or mahipal ko jamaanat milane kii ummid he
 If there is no relief, the possibility of this family taking a big decision at the time of an election cannot be ruled out
 kehete hai ki agar aap puri shiddat or mehnat ke saath apane lakshya ko paane kii koshish karte hai to aap kismat kii rekhaon ko bhi badal sakate hai
 a similar story is that of Saurabh Singh, a primary teacher living in Ballia
 saurabh ko haal hi main ghoshit hue uttar pradesh pisies 2016 ke parinaamon main aathvaan sthaan mila he
 Saurabh's maternal grandfather's dream was that his grandson should not become a teacher but to achieve something big
 saurabh aaj bhi apane naanaa kii bataai gai baton ko nahin bhuule hai
