 This scheme also has a major contribution in the coming of the second government of Modi government

 It remains to be seen what else the Finance Minister can do in this

 Advani wrote in his block, "if one reads the news of April 4 and other related news published on April 5 in detail, one has to admit that these reports are very worrying
 ’’ unhone bhaajapa pravaktaa kii is raay se sahmati jataai ki sena or sarkaar ke sambanddh sarvakalik nichle str par hai
 According to Advani, "it shows how much lack of mutual trust in institutional circles these days
" ’’ haalanki adwani ne is baat par raahat jataai ki indian express kii khabar main khud hi is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he ki is samachar kaa koi galat matlab na nikaala jaae
 Advani has written that the motive for printing this news was nothing more than curiosity
 bhaajapa netaa ne haalanki is maukey par purv grih mantri bootaa singh kii aalochana karte hue 1989 ke ek vaake ko yaad kiya jab chunaav main congress ke haarane or rajeev gandhi ke pradhanmantri pad se bedakhal hone ke baad loksabhaa bhang kiye jane se pehle unhone sena ko bulaane kaa prayaas kiya tha
 Advani said, "lieutenant Governor Bhandari can call himself innocent in this case, but the then Union Home Minister Buta Singh cannot deny that he had started the trick to call the army on the basis of a fraud trap
 uparajyapal kii gavaahi se yah sabit bhi hua
 The comments adwani ne kaha ki unke mitra or padosi dilli ke purv up-rajyapal vijay kapur ne rajeev gandhi ke haarane par sena bulaane kii bootaa singh kii koshish kii ghatana ke bare main unhen vistaar se bataaya tha

 The BJP leader said that after Rajiv's defeat, Buta Singh wanted to call the army before dissolving the Lok Sabha and that too on the basis of a concoction
 adwani ne apane block main likhaa, ‘‘ yadi koi chaar april kii khabar or paanch april ko prakashit anya sambhddha khabaron ko vistaar se padhe to use yah maananaa hoga ki yah khabaren behad chintajanak hai
 He agreed with the BJP spokesperson's opinion that the Army and the government's affiliations were at an all-time low
 adwani ke anusaar, ‘‘isse yah pataa chalata he ki in dinon sansthagat halkon main aapasi vishwaas kii kis kadar kami ho gai he
 However, Advani expressed relief on the fact that the Indian Express news itself had taken care that this news should not be misinterpreted
 adwani ne likhaa he ki is khabar ko chhapane kaa makasad jigyaasa se zyada or kuch nahin tha
 The BJP leader, however, recalled a 1989 incident criticizing former Home Minister Buta Singh on the occasion when he called the army before the dissolution of the Lok Sabha after the Congress lost the election and Rajiv Gandhi was ousted as Prime Minister
 Was tried
 adwani ne kaha, ‘‘uparajyapal bhandari is maamle main khud ko nirdosh bataa sakate hai, lekin tatkaaleen kendriya grih mantri bootaa singh isse inkaar nahin kar sakate ki unhone ek kapat jaal ke aadhaar par sena ko bulaane kii chaal kii shuruyaat kii thi
 This was also proved by the testimony of the Lieutenant Governor
 tippaniyan Advani said that his friend and neighboring Delhi's former Lt
 Governor Vijay Kapoor had told him in detail about Buta Singh's attempt to summon the army when Rajiv Gandhi was defeated
 kapur us samay dilli ke mukhya sachiv the
 Referring to the mention of that incident in the autobiography of the then Lt
 Governor of Delhi Romesh Bhandari, Advani said that Ajit Singh and others mobilized millions of farmers from Haryana and West Uttar Pradesh to march to Delhi and encircle Parliament and Rashtrapati Bhavan
 Based on the rumors, Buta Singh pressurized the Lieutenant Governor to act immediately
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki rajeev ke haarane par bootaa singh loksabhaa bhang karne se pehle sena ko bulaanaa chaahate the or vah bhi managasaint kahani ke aadhaar par
 According to Advani, "it shows how much lack of mutual trust in institutional circles these days

 bahut hi kam samay main patanjali ne bataur company aisi safalataa hasil kii he jo bahut kam hi companiyon ko naseeb hoti he
 The success of Patanjali is that not only foreign companies but also Indian companies have lost their sweat
 baba ramdev ke shabdon main, 'patanjali ke swadeshi abhiyaan ko hamane 5000 karod tak pahunchaaya or agle saal 10,000 karod se zyada kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 That is, our goal is to increase business by 150 percent in a year
 'vaaki ekadam nichle str se shuruyaat kar bazaar main pehle se maujuud companiyon ko badi takkar dena, vah bhi bina kisi nami chehre ke, bijness main ek badi safalataa gini jaaegi
 Of course, this journey was not easy and now that Baba has already achieved it, then know what 5 special lessons other companies can learn from it
 bijness kii samaj or kaam par pakadakisi bhi bijness kii safalataa kaam kii sahi jaankaree par nirbhar karti he
 You can become a successful businessman only when you have complete control over your work
 patanjali kii safalataa ke peeche sabase badi vajah yah rahi ki yoga guru baba ramdev ko yoga samet ayurveda kii puri jaankaree he
 He always knew what things people would take away

 Understanding the right timing market and landing the product according to the demand of the customer is the hallmark of a skilled businessman
 baba ramdev ko unki sahi timming ke liye puure-puure number milane chahie
 When the Maggi samples were failing all over the country and it was banned, Baba Ramdev put Patanjali noodles in the market
 3
 Customer understanding: It is very important for any business to have an understanding of customers
 ek bijnesaman ko pataa hona chahie ki uske graahak koun hai or ve kya chaahate hai? kya unhen wo mil rahaa he jisaki ummid wo aapse rakhte hai? baba ramdev logon kii nabj pahachaanate hai
 They say what people want to hear
 wo akasar, swadeshi, satyagrah or videshi companiyaan hamaare desh ko lut rahi hai jaisi baaten kehete rahete hai
 These things also have an impact and people directly connect with them
 4
 Good but cheap goods, customers get pulled if they get good things at a lower price
 patanjali ke products ke saath bhi kuch aisa hi he
 Ramdev keeps comparing the products of other company and the price of his products in his advertisements
 unhone logon ko bahut hi sidhe saral dhang se samajha diya he ki falaan company kaa shahad mahangaa he or unka shahad sasta
 This is the reason why today Patanjali's products have become a necessity for every household
 5
 No brand ambassador, the name itself is enough; usually all companies make a familiar star an ambassador of the product to create a door-to-door identity of the product
 brands ambesder banane main ek moti rakam bhi company lagaati he
 It is also a formula hit
 lekin baba ramdev ne isse pare hatakar apane product ko desi avatar main utaarte hue uski quality par dhyaan diya
 Today the result is in front of everyone

 The Modi government has divided the 44 labor laws into 4 important categories - allowances, industrial security and welfare, social security and industrial relations

 However, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh has demanded that the bill containing reforms related to the allowances category should be passed in Parliament as soon as possible
 bhartiya majdoor sangh ke adhyaksh sike saji narayanan ne india today tivi ko bataaya, “shram sudhaaron kii chaar main se teen shreniyon par hamane aapatti jataai he

 hindi sahitya main gaanvgiraanv kii baat ho to munshi premchand ke baad sahaj hi jis kathakaar kaa naam dhyaan aata he vah hai, fanishwarnath renu
 He was a wonderful mind of the Indian public
 unki rachanaaen shabdachitr sareekhee hoti thim
 That is why Renu holds a highly respected place in the Indian literary world
 aaj renu kii punyatithi he
 Phaniswarnath Renu was born on 4 March 1921 in Aurahi Hingna village near Forbisganj in Araria district of Bihar
 us samay yah purniya jile kaa hissaa tha
 Renu ji did his early education in Forbesganj and Araria
 uske baad vah nepal chale gaye
 Staying there with the Koirala family, he passed the matriculation examination from the Viratnagar Adarsh school in Viratnagar
 baad main unhone kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay se jude vidhyalay se intermediat kii pariksha paas kii or 1942 main gandhi ji ke aahvaan par swatantraaa sangram main kud pade
 Renu's participation in the Quit India movement gave him an understanding of politics
 isi dauraan vah socialist party se jud gaye va raajnneeti main sakriy bhagidaari nibhaai
 He is said to have been the architect of the armed revolution against the oppressive state of Nepal in the year 1950, which resulted in the establishment of a democracy in Nepal
 renu ke jivan main sahitya va siyasat donon sathsath chalate rahe
 Renuji fought against lifelong exploitation and oppression
 fanishwarnath renu ne 1936 ke aasapaas se kahani lekhan kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Some of his stories were also published at that time, but they were immature stories of Kishore Renu
 1942 ke andolan main giraftaar hone ke baad jab ve 1944 main jail se mukt hue, tab ghar lautne par unhone 'batbaba' naamak pehali paripakv kahani likhi
 'batbaba' was published in the Weekly Vishwamitra issue of August 27, 1944, the second story of Renu 'pahalwan Ki Dholak' appeared in 'weekly Vishwamitra' on December 11, 1944
 saal 1954 main unki mahaan kriti 'mailaa anchal' prakashit hua
 The fame Renu got from his novel 'maaila Aanchal' is rare in Hindi literature
 is upanyaas ke prakaashan ne unhen rato-raat hindi ke ek bade kathakaar ke rup main sthapit kar diya
 Some critics termed it as the second best Hindi novel after Godan
 haalanki 'mailaa anchal' ne vivaad bhi kam nahin khadey kiye
 Burners from Renu called it a copy of Sathinath Bhaduri's Bengali novel 'dhodhai Charit Manas', but the craft of 'parati Parikatha' established what Renu is? Over time such false accusations came to an end
 1972 main renu ne apni antim kahani 'bhittichitra kii mayuri' likhi
 His number of stories available so far is 63
 'renu' ko jitani prasiddhi upanyaason se mili, utani hi prasiddhi unako unki kahaniyon se bhi mili
 His famous story collections are 'thumri', 'aginkhor', 'primitive Night Smell', 'ek Shraavani Dohari Ki Dhoop', 'good Men', 'complete Stories', etc
 'maare gaye gulfam' urf teesri kasam kaa to kahana hi kya?katha-sahitya ke alaava renu ne sansmaran, rekhachitr or reportaj aadi vidhaon main bhi likhaa
 His popular works include - 'sloppy Aanchal', 'parati Parikatha', 'julus', 'laritapa', 'kisane Crossroads', 'palatu Babu Road'; Story collection- 'A smell of a primitive night', 'thumri', 'agnikhor', 'good man', Reportage- 'debt water-dhanjal', 'nepali Revolution', 'the smell of Vanatulsi', 'shrut Ashrut East' etc
 Are included
 'samay kii shila par', 'aatm parichay' unke sansmaran hai
 Apart from this, Renu ji used to write reports in 'dinman Patrika'
 'nepali kranti katha' unke reportaj kaa uttam udhaaharan he
 The stories that created a record of fame include 'killed Gulfam' aka Teesri Kasam, 'A Primitive Night Smell', 'lal Paan Ki Begum', 'panchlite', 'tbe Ekla Chalo Re', 'prod', 'samvadiya' 'etc
 renu ke rachanakarm kii khaasiyat yah thi ki unki lekhan-style varnanaatmak thi
 That is why both the characters and the background of their plot would have left the same effect of the film
 unki rachanaaon main aanchalikta kaa chitra kuch aise khinchaa hota tha, ki aap bina us anchal main gaye uski kalpana kar sakate hai
 In almost every story, the thinking of the characters was dominated by events
 renu ji ne jaiprakash narayan andolan main sakriy bhagidaari kii or satta dwaara daman ke virodh main padmashri kaa tyaag kar diya
 Renuji expanded the regional story in Hindi, the foundation of which was laid by Munshi Premchand
 sachchidanand hiranand vatsyayan 'agyeya' jaise sthapit rachanakaaron kii mitrataa ke alaava vah us daur main patna ke udiyaman photopatrkaar es

 Two days before the introduction of the Parliament, new difficulties have arisen in the path of the Nuclear Liability Bill as the BJP and the Left parties slammed the government for 'weakening' the supplier's liability through new changes in the draft bill

 The Left parties said that the proposed amendment by the government in the Civil Nuclear Liability Bill is not only contrary to the essence of the important recommendations of the Standing Committee, but also through it to protect the interests of foreign suppliers of nuclear equipment and domestic private companies
 The provisions mentioned in the Bill have been sought to be weakened further

 Another attempt is being made to resolve the Ayodhya issue

 Together, they have decided that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad will not be included in the entire dialogue

 After negotiations with Hashim Ansari, an agreement was also reached between all the parties involved in the matter
 samjhaute ke masaude par hastakshar hone hi vaale the, lekin ain vakt par baat nahin ban pai
 Mahant Gyan Das says that the people of VHP do not want to solve this issue because they feel that if this happens, then their shop will be closed

 The court said that the land where Ramlala is sitting and the land around it should be given to the Ram temple
 baaki ek tihaai jameen sunni vakf board ko or ek tihaai jameen nirmohi akhaada ko di jaae
 How far is the floor of the agreement? Two weeks before the High Court's decision, there was another attempt to find a peaceful solution to the problem
 18 march 2010 ko ilahabaad hai court ke sevanivrutt jaj palok basu kii pahal par paanch sadasyon vaali ek samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya tha

 Whether or not there is something more immediate by trying, it saves you from wandering off the floor

 duusari - samjhaute main prastaavit mandir or masjid ko 100 feet oonchi diwaar se baant diya jaae, taaki bhavishya main vivaad ke halaat na paidaa hone kii gunjaaish na bache
 Mahant Gyan Das's stand is very clear
 wo kehete hai, "ham aise kisi bhi kaary ke paksh main nahin he jisase hamaare muslim bhaaiyon ko lage ki ve haare hue hai
 "das further adds," We strongly condemn the VHP and bjp's stand that the mosque be built outside the boundary of Panchkoshi Parikrama of Ayodhya

 Last year, a year and four days after scoring his 99th century in the World Cup, the veteran sports legend of India completed his century by playing a single at square leg off left-arm spinner Saqib Al Hasan in the 44th over of the innings
 tendulkarne iske liye 138 gend kheli jo unke sabase dhimeshtconmen se ek tha lekin ek dashak pehle jis sankhya ke bare main sochaa bhi nahin ja saktaa tha use hasil karke vah na sirf raahat mahasoos kar rahe the balki utsaah se bhi sarabor the

 Kohli, who has been in good form since the tour of Australia, also looked in a position to score a century in the third match in a row but he was forced to return to the pavilion after being left-arm spinner Abdur Razzaq on the stump

 If you wanted to fight black money then why did you make a 2000 note
 pehle match main chir pratidwandvi pakistan ko haraane vaali bhartiya haaki team mangalvaar ko naa to vah lay barkaraar rakh saki or naa hi tevar jiskaa bakhubi phayda uthaate hue austrailia ne use 5-2 se raundkar 12wein vishwa cap main pehali jeet darj kii
 Drag flicker Sandeep Singh, who was the hero of the 4–1 win in the first match, looked in poor form while experienced forward players like Deepak Thakur and Prabhjot Singh were also disappointed
 bharat ko striker shivendra singh kii kami buree tarah khali jo do maichon kaa nilamban jhel rahe hai
 The Indian defense also looked completely dispersed, with Australia having no problem in making a dent
 austrailia ke liye de yang liyaam (doosraa minute), glen turnar (aathvaan or 43waan minute), desmund eboat (26waan) or like dornar (41waan minute) ne gol daage jabaki bharat ke liye vikram pillai (35waan minute) or captain raajapaal singh (53waan) ne gol kiye
 After suffering an unexpected defeat at the hands of England in the first match, the Australian team proved India dwarfed in every department in this match of survival
 unke damakham or gati kaa bharatiyon ke paas koi jawaab nahin tha
 In the first match, the Indian team, playing with the attitude of the winners, looked tired
 duusare hi minute main austrailian gol se bana dabaav ant tak bharatiyon par haaavee rahaa
 Australia got two consecutive penalty corners in the seventh and eighth minutes
 pehle par bhartiya golkeeper adrian disuja ne gol bachaa liya lekin duusare par ribound shaat ke jariye glen turnar ne gol karke team kii badhat duguni kii di
 Australia scored another penalty corner in the 13th minute but could not score
 iske teen minute baad disuja ne austrailian strikaron ke ek behtareen move ko phinishing se bachaaya
 India got their first penalty corner in the 22nd minute but Sandeep Singh, a two-goal drag flicker against Pakistan, failed this time
 is bich 26wein minute main austrailian farward pankti ne ek baar phir bhartiya dephence main jabardast send lagaate hue teesraa gol daag diya
 Grant Schubert crosses Robert Hammond with Desmond Abbot scoring the ball
 teen gol ganvaane ke baad bharatiyon ne aakhri do minute main lagaataar hamale bole
 This also resulted in another penalty corner in the 34th minute but the umpire called it invalid after the Australian players took video referrals
 bharat ke liye 35wein minute main vikram pillai ne khaataa kholaa
 Arjun Halappa, snatching the ball from the Australian defenders, gave him a cross on which he put the ball within the goal from the right, giving the Indian fans the only chance to be happy in the first half
 duusare half main bhi bhartiya khilaadiyon kii dasha or disha nahin badal saki
 Australia then converted two penalty corner goals within two minutes to extend the lead to 5-1
 pehle dornar ne or phir turnar ne ye gol daage
 India got a penalty corner in the 52nd minute which Sandeep failed to convert
 lekin bharatiyon ne gend par se niyantran nahin khoyaa or ek baar phir halppa ne plamekar kii apni bhoomika bakhubi nibhaate hue raajapaal ko cross diya jisane gol karne main koi chook nahin kii
 Australia would have won by another margin but d'souza set up a fine goalkeeping and saved the penalty corner in the 54th minute and a penalty stroke in the 65th minute

 Mayawati, the chief of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), claimed that the BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) tried to bring down the disputed structure in Ayodhya due to a dirty mentality towards Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, who had built the country's constitution on the basis of secularism

 pehali baar pradesh kii raajnneeti main kadam rakhane vaale kamalnath ke saamne party ke bade vaadon ko puraa karne ke liye keval acha prashasan dene kii hi nahin balki loksabhaa chunaavon main congress party ko kamyaabi dilaane kii bhi kadi chunauti he
 What are the challenges and how is Kamal Nath facing them? The first challenge is political difficulties
 apane keval 114 vidhayakon or congress se baghawat karke bataur nirdaleey ummidavaar chunaav jitkar aae chaar vidhayakon ke alaava basapa ke do or sapa ke ek vidhayak ke samarthan ko milakar 121 vidhayakon ke saath 230 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main sarkaar ke paas bahut maamuli bahumat he
 a former minister of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government from Gwalior region is in touch with independent mlas and some Congress mlas in an attempt to persuade them to resign so that their by-elections are held again if their seats are vacant
 bhaajapa ko ummid he ki aisa hone par party upachunaavon main jeet hasil karke bahumat ke aankade tak pahunch sakati he
 Although the central leadership of the Congress feels that Kamal Nath is someone who has the ability to run the government despite a modest majority, the Chief Minister will have to be vigilant about the number of mlas at all times, especially during the assembly sessions when the BJP a strong opposition with 109 mlas will stand in front
 cabinet kaa gathan or mantralayon kaa aavanton bahut kathin kaam sabit hua he kyonki mantralayon ke aavanton ko lekar vidhayakon se baatcheet karne main saamaanya se kahin zyada samay lag gaya tha
 Although this work is now complete, it does not mean that everything is well
 mukhyamantri ke rup main kamalnath aise mantriyon ke saath kaam karenge jinhen cabinet main jagah dene kaa nirnay akele unka nahin rahaa he
 BJP has 26 seats out of 29 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 2019 main congress kii yojana is sankhya ko adhik se adhik ghataane or apane liye kam se kam 15 siten jeetne kii he
 Given the way the BJP gave a tough fight to the Congress in the assembly elections, this task will not be easy
 lekin mukhyamantri pehle hi is kaam par lag gaye hai
 He has started talks with potential candidates for the Lok Sabha elections and wants to put more and more OBC (other Backward Class) candidates on the unreserved seats
 loksabhaa chunaavon kii yojana ko lekar kamalnath kitne gambhir hai, yah isi baat se pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki party ko chanda dene vaale sambhavit logon par vidhansabha chunaavon main ek seemaa se adhik dabaav nahin daalaa gaya tha kyonki party ke netritv kaa maananaa tha ki loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ke dhanabal kaa saamana karne ke liye in logon kii dobaaraa jarurat padegi
 Also, this is Kamal Nath's first term in state politics
 kendriya mantri ke taur par unke paas kaaphi anubhav he lekin centre main mantralay chalaane or rajya main sarkaar chalaane main bahut antar hota he
 a senior administrative officer says, "at the center level, the minister has a whole body of secretaries and joint secretaries to work, but at the state level, the level below the departmental secretary is not as efficient as it is at the center
" 
 '' iske alaava rajya main jila colector or rajya kii rajdhani main baabuon kii puri lambii-chaudee fouj hoti he, jinke kaamkaaj par har samay najar rakhane kii jarurat hoti he
 As a Union Minister, Kamal Nath was known as a result-maker who knew how to work with bureaucrats
 bhopal main adhikari is baat se khush dikhaai dete hai ki ab unheen kaa raaj chalegaa kyonki mukhyamantri or 28 main 8 mantriyon ko chhodkar baakiyon ke paas sarkaar chalaane kaa koi anubhav nahin he
 Therefore, the Chief Minister will have to closely monitor all the Ministries, even though they have declared that all the Ministers will be fully accountable to the functioning of their departments
 naukarshahi ke khush hone kii ek or vajah yah he ki kamalnath ne tabadalon or niyuktiyon ke madhyam se koi bada badlaav karne kii koshish nahin kii he
 Only those collectors who have been found to be acting maliciously against the Congress candidates during the elections have been replaced, according to the feedback of party leaders
 kamalnath ke saath pehle kaam kar chuke ek anya prashasnic adhikari kehete hai, ''rajya ke kaamkaaj main aksar chizon kii bahut baarikiyon par dhyaan dena hota he jabaki centre main aisa nahin hota
 Kamal Nath does not go into many nuances, but he will have to change his way here soon
 ''baharhaal, mukhyamantri logon ke saath baatcheet main bahut sookshmata se jaankariyaan lete hai
 When an administrative officer visited him in his office, he was surprised to see that he was sitting with an Executive Record (ER) sheet
 is shit main adhikariyon kii niyuktiyon kii puri suchi hoti he
 Like a CEO, he asks a potential officer, "so what is your special ability and where can you use it?" Also, unlike his predecessor, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who is in a hurry to go somewhere, Kamal Nath people Listen to the talk in full 15 minutes time
 kamalnath or chouhan main ek baat jarur samaan he, or vah yah he ki ve bahut kam der ke liye sote hai or alpahari hai
 "the chief minister always has to be busy and work longer than the central minister, because he has to take decisions on both political and administrative fronts," says a senior administrative officer who has worked in the chief minister's secretariat
 
 kendriya mantri ke maamle main rajnatik faisle lene kaa kaam mukhya rup se pradhanmantri kaa hota he
 On the administrative front, the biggest challenge before Kamal Nath is to successfully implement the debt waiver of farmers
 haalanki karjamaafee kii ghoshnaa ho chuki he lekin uskaa phayda kise milegaa, is vishay par kaam karne kii jarurat he
 If there is no clarity about this, then the Congress may have to suffer loss in the Lok Sabha
 camel nath jis din mukhyamantri ghoshit kiye gaye the, usee din unhone kaha tha, ''ham ghoshnaa patr main ullikhit har vaade kaa sammaan karenge
 Farmers are already upset due to the piece of land and not getting the proper price for the produce and they have to be forced to commit suicide
 krishi ke is sankat kaa samaadhaan karjamaafee jaise upayon se nahin kiya ja saktaa
 For this sustainable solution, investment in agriculture infrastructure and population needs to be diverted to other related areas

 It is estimated to bear the burden of ise dekhte hue shankaa jaahir kii ja rahi he ki congress sarkaar rajya kii arthvyavastha par koi bada asar daale bina kaise yah boj uthaa paaegi

 congress ke kai anya vaade bhi aarthik prabhaav daalane vaale hai jaise ki kisaanon ke bijli ke bill ko aadha karnaa, berozegaron ko 4,000 ru
 Per month allowance and reducing the prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas

 purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh rajya sarkaar ke menter ke rup main dilachasp bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 They are working as a person to make Kamal Nath aware of the feelings of the organization
 kamalnath ko bhi yah pataa he ki congress sanghathan par digvijay kii pakad kitni gahari he
 Both are old

 Some decisions of the new government have given rise to controversy such as the Vande Mataram singing of employees in the ministry to stop and resume it and the Rs 25,000 received by MISA detainees so far during the Emergency
 prati maah kii pension ko band karnaa unamem shaamil he
 It is also a challenge for Kamal Nath that instead of stepping back on his decisions, he should stick to them
 kadam peeche khinchne se bhaajapa ko takat milegi
 Reacting to some transfers, former Chief Minister Chauhan had said, "decisions are being taken and then they are being withdrawn
" yahi saaf nahin he ki sarkaar koun chalaa rahaa he
 "one of the priority of the Chief Minister will be to revive the moribund industrial area again
" iske alaava rojgaar kaa srijan bhi taatkaalik chunauti he
 The previous BJP government organized several investment conferences in which well-known industrialists participated but did not see any increase in investment except in the textile sector, in which Vardhman and Trident in former Chief Minister Chauhan's constituency Budhni
 Plants were set up
 vaanijya mantri ke taur par kamalnath kaa anubhav or chhindwara main udyogon ko aakarshith karne kii yogyata unke kaam aa sakati he
 Challenges in front of the demoralized Chief Minister have been able to get a modest figure of the Congress majority (121 out of 230) and in front of him a formidable opposition like the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the election manifesto of the Congress, from the farm loan waiver to the unemployed, Rs 4,000
 masik bhatta dene, eendhan or rasoi gas ke daam ghataane jaise vaade the jinhen puraa karne main rajya ke khajaane or sansadhano par baari boj aane vaala he

 Had Gurudutt been alive, he would have been 90 years old on July 9, but the geniuses like Gurudutt would not have spent 90 years, he would have done so much at the age of 39 that 51 years after his death Have not been able to forget
 unhen aaj bhi bhartiya cinema ke itihaas main misaal ke taur dekha jaataa he or ye silsilaa aage bhi jari rahegaa
 Much has been said about Gurudutt's cinematic understanding, for example, that he was a forward-thinking filmmaker
 filmon ke takneekee paksh ko unhone behad kareeb se samajha tha
 The way he used close-up shots of the camera in 'pepper Ke Phool' is still considered cult
 kai tarah ke sangeet ko milakar bhi gurudutt ne adbhut prayog kiye
 Gurudutt was a perfectionist, he used to shut down whenever he felt he could not do justice to the film
 yahi vajah he ki unki kai filmein adhuri rah gayi
 Apart from the technical side, even as a filmmaker, Gurudutt realized his social responsibilities

 Bangla novelist Bimal Mitra was seen very closely to his restless life
 inhen ke upanyaas ‘sahab bivi gulam’ par gurudutt ne mashhoor film banaai thi or isaki patakatha ke liye unhone bimal mitra ko kolkata se khaastaur par bulaayaa tha

 An important reason for the tension between the two was that Gurudutt did not want Geeta to sing in films later
 vah chaahate the ki gita kaa dhyaan gruhasthi par hi rahe, jo un jaisi star ke liye peedaadaayak hi nahin, apmanjanak bhi tha
 The story of 'sahab Biwi Aur Ghulam' was actually the story of Gurudutt's own life, about which Geeta Dutt also told Bimal Mitra

 ab aise filmkaar aapako kahin nahin milenge, lekin 'pyaasa', 'kaagaj ke phool', 'sahab, bibi or gulam' jaisi filmon vaale gurudutt yaad aate rahenge
 Gurudutt also performed amazing experiments mixing many types of music
 gurudutt ek parafectionist the, unhen jab kabhi lagata tha ki vah is film ke saath nyaay nahin kar paa rahe hai, to use band kar dete the
 This is the reason why many of his films remain incomplete
 takneekee paksh ke alaava bhi ek filmkaar ke taur bhi gurudutt ko apni samaajik jimmedaariyon kaa ahsaas tha
 That is why Gurudutt is believed to be the first such filmmaker after independence who tried to show in his films that the kind of social justice that was done before independence did not get to people after independence
 yahi vajah he ki unki adhikansh filmon kaa nayak traasadee kaa shikaar dikhataa he
 What a strange coincidence that his own life was also full of tragedy
 duniya main sukhi hone ke liye insaan jin chizon kii kaamana karata he, guru dutt ke paas vah sab kuch tha

 Now such filmmakers will not find you anywhere, but Gurudutt will continue to miss films like 'pyaasa', 'pepper Ke Phool', 'sahab, Bibi Aur Ghulam'
 takneekee paksh ke alaava bhi ek filmkaar ke taur bhi gurudutt ko apni samaajik jimmedaariyon kaa ahsaas tha
 That is why Gurudutt is believed to be the first such filmmaker after independence who tried to show in his films that the kind of social justice that was done before independence did not get to people after independence
 yahi vajah he ki unki adhikansh filmon kaa nayak traasadee kaa shikaar dikhataa he
 What a strange coincidence that his own life was also full of tragedy
 duniya main sukhi hone ke liye insaan jin chizon kii kaamana karata he, guru dutt ke paas vah sab kuch tha
 Honor, honor, wealth, prestige, health, beautiful wife and lovely children

 vaise kitna ajeeb sanyog he ki unka apana jivan bhi behad traasadee bharaa rahaa
 Guru Dutt had everything he wished to be happy in the world
 maan-sammaan, yash, daulat, pratishtha, sehat, khubasurat patni or pyaare-pyaare bachche
 Despite this, he was restless
 unka kahana tha- mujhe nirdeshak bananaa tha, ban gaya
 Had to become an actor, became
 acchhee pikchar banani thi, bana lee
 There is also a lot of money, but nothing
 yah khalipan avsaad ke us str tak bhi pahunchaa, jab unhone aatmahatya kii koshish kii
 Bangla novelist Bimal Mitra was seen very closely to his restless life
 inhen ke upanyaas ‘sahab bivi gulam’ par gurudutt ne mashhoor film banaai thi or isaki patakatha ke liye unhone bimal mitra ko kolkata se khaastaur par bulaayaa tha
 During the last four-five years of his life, Guru Dutt was closely related to Bimal Mitra
 guru dutt kii asamay maut ke baad bimal mitra ne ek upanyaas likhaa, jiskaa hindi anuwaad ‘bichhude sabhi baari-baari’ naam se vaani prakaashan se prakashit he
 Bimal Mitra stayed at Guru Dutt's bungalow and form house in connection with the script writing of 'sahab Biwi Ghulam'
 lihaaja ve unke ghar-parivaar ke sadasyon se bhi mil chuke the
 In such a situation, after the death of Guru Dutt, these novels reveal the story of the relationship between Guru Dutt's life and wife Geeta Dutt and the growing closeness of Waheeda Rehman
 bimal mitra likhte hai, ki unhen is baat par achraj hota tha ki guru dutt ke paas paali hill main shandaar bangala tha, lekin unako vahaan neend nahin aati thi
 He would spend the whole night sipping a glass of whiskey and cigarettes, and would get ready in the morning to go to the studio and lock his makeup room from inside and sleep deeply

 On the other hand, he was knowledgeable, patient, stable, prudent, compassionate, charity, selfless and ego free

 That person was a very beggar

 The needs of the man were modest, a pair of rubber slippers, a sando ganji and a lungi that could survive

 Nobody, mother, brother, sister, brother-in-law, friend of Guru Dutt
 gurudutt or gita dutt ke jivan main shaadi ke chah saal baad hi tanaav bad gaya tha
 One reason for this is believed to be Waheeda Rehman, with whom Gossip used to go about his love affair
 haalanki bimal mitra ke mutabik, gita-wahidaa aapas main ek hi parivaar kii do bahanon kii tarah milti-julati thim
 An important reason for the tension between the two was that Gurudutt did not want Geeta to sing in films later
 vah chaahate the ki gita kaa dhyaan gruhasthi par hi rahe, jo un jaisi star ke liye peedaadaayak hi nahin, apmanjanak bhi tha
 The story of 'sahab Biwi Aur Ghulam' was actually the story of Gurudutt's own life, about which Geeta Dutt also told Bimal Mitra

 Time has been given till May 2 to respond to the notes
 ye yachika fariyaad naam kii ek enjio ne daayar kii he

 jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main hue aatanki hamale ke baad chautarafa ghire pakistan ne ek baar phir aatanki sanghathanon par dikhaave kii karrwai kii he
 On Thursday, the Pakistan government banned jamaat-ud-dawa and falah-e-insaniyat Foundation, an organization of global terrorist Hafiz Saeed
 is ection ko pulavama ke baad bane dabaav main kii gai karrwai ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he, haalanki is faisle main jaish-e-mohammad sanghathan kaa naam bhi nahin liya gaya he jo ki pulavama aatanki hamale kaa asli gunaahagaar he
 What will happen with such action? This is not the first time that Pakistan has acted on these organizations, even before it becomes international on it, it keeps adopting such tactics
 ab ek baar phir isi dabaav main aakar pakistan ne ye kadam uthaaya he
 However, it does not seem to make much difference, because even before when Pakistan has banned them, Hafiz Saeed has come to the world with a new terrorist organization every time
 udhaaharan ke taur par lashkar-e-taiyaba par bain laga to usne jamaat-ud-daawa kaa naam de diya
 Despite all the stops, Hafiz is still openly holding rallies
 hafiz ke sanghathan par bain pehle bhi lagata rahaa he, is bain kii avadhi khatm ho gai thi jise pakistan ne aage badhaayaa he
 Hafiz shows these organizations as charity and collects money to spread terror
 kya pulavama hamale kaa dabaav?14 farvari ko pulavama main hue aatanki hamale kaa asli gunaahagaar jaish-e-mohammad he
 Other countries including India put pressure on Pakistan to act on it
 pakistan ne karrwai to kii, lekin jaish par nahin
 It banned only organizations including jud whose charity is suspicious
 yani jaish-e-mohammad kaa sargana moulana masood ajahar abhi bhi pakistan army kii security main he
 Why did Pakistan have to take action? Actually, this action of Pakistan is not under pressure from India or anyone else, but there is a fear behind it
 antarrashtriya sanstha financial ection task force (FATF) kii baithak honi he, jisamen pakistan grey list main shaamil he
 These organizations provide money to some countries to fight against terrorism
 bharat kii koshish he ki vah pakistan ko FATF se blaclist karwaae taaki use kisi tarah kii madad naa mil paae
 Being blacklisted here also means that Pakistan's ratings will fall in IMF, World Bank and other international institutions as well and may have to bear huge losses
 idhar sanghathan par bain, udhar yuddh kii taiyaari!bataa den ek taraf se pakistan duniya ke saamne khud ko aatank grasit desh dikhaane ke liye in sanghathanon par karrwai kar rahaa he
 On the other hand, he is also plotting against India
 guuruuvaar ko hi pakistan suraksha samiti kii baithak main pradhanmantri imran khan ne apni sena ko khuli chhot di he ki vah bharat par karrwai kare
 Since then, the Pakistan Army led by Army Chief Qamar Bajwa has carried out activities along the border
 central bank of india (CBI) main vaikency nikali he

 aspx satalok se salaakhon tak kaa faasla tay kar chuke sant rampal kii takadir to ab adaalat kii mutthi main he
 But as soon as Rampal goes to jail, the philosophy of his ashram is shattered
 is ashram main kahin kile kii jhalak milti he to kahin gupt thikaana najar aata he
 Somewhere a resting place is seen and somewhere a boisterous base
 kul milakar ye ashram, ashram kam baba'lok' zyada he
 Scaffolding remains in the ashram
 pehali najar main in machaanon ko dekhakar ye gumaan ho saktaa he ki shaayad inhen construction ke iraade se taiyaar kiya gaya he
 But the whole story becomes clear as soon as we look at the mattresses placed on top of the scaffold and the surrounding area
 petrol bam se lekar tejaab or pattharon se bhari baaltee ke saath hi gulel
 In other words, every item of death that can be attacked
 jisase jaan lee ja sake
 But in a place like Ashram, where there is talk of union of soul and God, these things of death startle
 ye or baat he ki ye machaan or in saamaan kaa sach duniya ke saamne aam ho chukaa he
 With the arrest of Rampal, the clock for the battle against the police and the law through these scaffolds has come to a close for the last 18 days
 garaj ye ki auraton or bacchon kii oot main chhipakar khud ko bachaane kii koshish karanevaala rampal ab shikanje main aa chukaa he
 It is another matter that he does not desist from calling himself innocent
 lekin rampal ke satalok ashram kaa tilism abhi or bhi he
 The main gate of the ashram is a special door in the ashram
 yani wo jagah, jahaan se hokar bhakton ke liye andar aane or jane kii rasta he
 But after moving a bit beyond this gate, the sign board is seen
 yahaan ashram ke andar daakhil hone or apane guru ke paas pahunchane se pehle har bhakt ke liye apni talaashi deni jaruri he or to or apni hifaazat main koi kami naa rah jaae, iske liye anginat hand held metal detectors kaa bhi intjaam he
 Like an impregnable gate of a fort, an iron gate separating the two parts of the ashram
 police kii maane to aam bhakton ko is get se andar jane kii ijaajat nahin he
 Those names can directly reach this place of rest, i
e
, dormitory after donation and devotion
 lekin rampal apane kuch chuninda sipahasalaron ke saath is vishaal get ke andar apane durg main kaid rahata he
 The swimming pool along with Baba's living room is exposing Rampal's face as the curtain rises from Bhimrampal's Satlok Ashram
 to kya rampal santai kii aad main paakhand kaa khel, kheltaa tha? kya wo pravachan or naam daan ke naam par logon ko bevakoof bana rahaa tha? ye sawaal isliye, kyonki satalok ashram kii andruni tasviren is ashram ko ashram nahin, balki aaramgaah bataa rahi hai
 There is also a swimming bridge adjacent to Rampal's living room
 darasal yah uske thakaan utaarne kii wo jagah he, jahaan bhajan-pravachan ke baad rampal aksar tairaa karata tha
 Near the bridge are Rampal's huge bed, muslin mattress, luxurious sofa and electronic chests kept to save lakhs of money from offerings
 ashram main rampal kaa exclusive bathroom bhi itnaa aaleeshaan he ki dekhanevaale hairaan ho sakate hai
 There is a secret way in the ashram, perhaps this is the reason that while Rampal has divided his ashram into a special and common part through an iron gate, on the one hand, there is also a secret road to reach a special place from a particular area
 It is arranged
 ye gupt rasta paanch manjila kothinuma ashram ke us privet floor tak jaataa he, jahaan rampal ke sivaay or kisi ko jane kii ijaajat nahin thi
 But this story of the luxury of Rampal, who describes himself as a follower of Kabir, who lives a Fakkad life, is even more surprised when the ashram power enhancers are also discovered during the search
 police kii maane to rampal ke ashram se police ko shakti vardhak dawaaen bhi mili hai, jiskaa istemaal aksar log apni kamottejnaa badhaane ke liye karte hai
 There is also Rampal's spacious kitchen and a discourse house designed for the bosom of spirituality
 ek taraf is vishaal haul main ek saath hajaaron logon ke sone-baithne kaa intjaam he
 On the other hand, the kitchen of the ashram fills thousands of people every day
 lekin dikkat tab he, jab pravachan ke naam par andbar ho or is rasoi kaa khaanaa khilaakar begunaah or bhole-bhaale bhakton ko kanoon se bachane ke liye dhaal bana liya jaataa ho
 The old is Rampal and Risharampal of jail was jailed for the first time in 2006 in a murder case
 uske baad se wo tamaam tarkiben nikalakar police or kanoon ke haathon se bachataa rahaa
 But after this new gimmick of Rampal this time, now 19 strict streams have been imposed on him
 in dhaaraon main umr kaid se lekar faansee tak kii sajaa mumkin he
 As the police reached the rampage, Rampal got all the furious air
 dramebaaji to giraftaar ke baad khub kii baba ne, lekin police ne uske aparaadhon kii list or us par lagaai dhaaraon kaa hawala diya to jaise halak suukh gaya
 What Rampal has done while challenging the court order, can lead to a death sentence
 iske alaava aadhi se zyada sampati ganvaani pad sakati he
 Which streams are such that the currents on Rampal are such that no maneuver can be used now
 police ne baba rampal or uske pravaktaa, ashram prabandhak cameti va anuyaayiyon par deshadroh jaisi sangeen 19 dhaaraon ke tahat cese darj kiya he
 These include Section 120, which is related to criminal conspiracy
 isamen sajaa aparaadh kii gambhirtha ke hisaab se tay hogi
 Section 121, the charge under this is that of country malignancy, in which the punishment can range from life imprisonment to death
 dhara-121-e, isamen desh ke khilaaf yuddh kii sajeesh rachane kaa maamla he
 The punishment is life imprisonment
 dhara-122, iske tahat yuddh kii manshaa se hathiyaar jamaa karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he, isamen sajaa umrakaid tak kii ho sakati he
 Apart from this, Section-123, attempt to murder can be punishable with imprisonment from 10 years to life
 dhara-436, aagjanee karnaa, jisamen sajaa 10 saal se umrakaid tak kii sunai ja sakati he
 Apart from these sections, sections like obstructing government duty, hostage, criminal conspiracy have also been imposed on Rampal
 yani aparaadh sabit hua, to kamase kam umr bhar ke liye jail kii hawa khaani tay he
 Not only this, Baba may also have to pay a compensation of Rs 50 crore
 hoicourt pehle hi kah chukaa he giraftaar ke liye 60 ghante kii gheraabandi or 45 hajaar javaanon tainaat kiye jane par jo bhi kharchaa aayaa he, use baba kii sampatti se vasula ja saktaa he
 That means, if fined, almost half of Baba's wealth was understood

 The school management is putting the power department's power department on the issue as well, the last method of payment on the issue is 7 September 6 billion 18 crore and 50, it is so difficult to speak this number, then seeing this as a bill will blow the senses of the good
 But this has actually happened in PM Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi
 ek taraf uttar pradesh nikal bijli ke daam mahange ho gaye hai, jisase upabhoktaaon ke bajet par kaaphi prabhaav padaa he
 In such a situation, a day after the increase in electricity price, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi electricity department has reported a case of major negligence where 618
 5 karod rupye kaa bijli kaa bill bhej diya gaya he
 An electricity bill of about 6 billion 18 crore 51 lakh has been sent to a private school in Vinayaka area of varanasi
 yah maamla varanasi jile kaa he
 This bill has been sent to a private school
 yahi nahin jisamen bijli kaa bill na jamaa karne par 7 sitambar tak conection kaatane kaa bhi farmaan jari kiya gaya he
 Actually, this school of private school of Varanasi is located in Vinayaka area of the city
 bijli kaa bill dekhne ke baad skool ke prabandhan ko behad hairaani hui
 The amount of electricity bill for the management of the school is so much that it cannot fill this electricity bill
 yahi nahin itani badi raashi kaa bill kisi ke liye bhi bhar paanaa naammumkin he
 618 amount of payment of electricity bill
 5 karod rupye he
 When the school management approached the electricity department about this, they raised their hands
 kai dinon tak chakkar kaatane ke baavjood abhi tak skool ko kahin se koi raahat nahin mili he
 On the other hand, due to the drive to cut the electricity connection of the remaining connection holders of the electricity department, the school's connection is afraid to be disconnected because the date of submission of electricity bill is 7 September
 ab is bare main vibhaag maun saadhe hue hai or kisi ko samaj main nahin aa rahaa ki aakhirkaar ek saamaanya skool kaa bill itnaa baari bharkam kaise aa saktaa he
 According to the school coordinator Yogendra Mishra, he has deposited all the previous electricity bills but after that one month's bill is surprising
 yogendra mishra kaa kahana he ki is bijli bill kii shikaayat unhone purvanchal vidyut vitaran nigam ke prabandhak nideshak ke daftar main kiya tha
 But there he was sent back after being told that there was a software flaw
 vahiin bijli vibhaag kii is laaparvaahee ke bare main tamaam koshishon ke baad bhi unke adhikari kuch bhi bolne se batch rahe hai
 Yogendra Mishra says that he has been going round the electricity department for the last several days to fix the electricity bill but he got nothing but assurance
 adhikariyon ne karection ke naam par ek baar saade 9 hajaar rupye jamaa bhi karaae lekin uske baad bhi 6 arab kaa bill aa gaya or ab is bijli bill ko jamaa na karne kii sthiti main conection kaate jane kii taarikh 7 sitambar kii he or jaise-jaise taarikh najadik aa rahi he vaise-vaise skool kii chintaa badhati ja rahi he

 Super Kings have also started preparations for this
 siesake ne daawa kiya he ki abhi bhi unke liye mahendra singh dhoni sabase bade lakshya hai or wo hi team ke sabase ahm kadi rahenge
 It is believed that Dhoni is very happy with this attitude of the team

 At present, only Virat Kohli can be stood alongside Dhoni

 Nikhil Chopra believes that Dhoni will be in the top-5 of the most expensive players in the IPL
 unamem netritv kii adbhut kshamta team ko jeet dilaane main sabase madadgaar sabit hoti he
 As far as the IPL is concerned, of course a lot of teams will look desperate to bid on Dhoni

 -input language teen disambar ko International Day of Persons with Disabilities ke taur par manaaya jaataa he
 In 1992, the United Nations decided to make this day so that its excuse was to create an understanding between the common people and the governments about the physical and mental competence and according to them the rights should be understood in the society
 taaki agar jab ham dekhen ki koi imaarat, koi sadak yaa bazaar yaa daftar is lihaaz se na ho to pehla sawaal ye dimag main aae ki iskaa na hona, sanvaidhanik adhikaar kaa ulanghan he
 a few days ago i went to California
 vahaan ke mantere main ek public bas dekhi
 i was surprised to see the whole process
 bas kaa driver puri zimmedaari se shaareerik rup se behad kamazor ho chuke ek buzurg ko hydrolic lift ke zarie bas main chadha rahaa tha
 It was a pleasant surprise for me to have such a lift in the bus
 garv hua ki ye hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 One more thing was understood
 jab system par bharosa ho to koi umr ke is padaav par akele bazaar ja saktaa he
 If you watch the video, we will know that we are hardly going to let the elderly of this age alone because the system is missing
 aap ye video dekhie
 Then ask why this cannot happen in India
 somvaar raat ko aal india radio par viklang diwas kii purv sandhya par ek charchaa sun rahaa tha
 When a caller asked that the system of special coaches made for the disabled by several trains has been abolished, the responsible person in the discussion did not respond
 yahi kaha ki railway se baat kar rahe hai
 We have received a suggestion that the location of coaches for the disabled should be fixed
 yaa to sabase peeche lage yaa ingine ke thik baad lage magar achaanak na badale
 a lot is found in Delhi in this case, but the other states are in very bad condition
 gaanvon main to or bhi bura haal he
 Although some changes have started to appear at the level of policies, but very good work is not being done at the level of implementation
 2016 main bharat sarkaar ne The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act yani RPWD Act 2016 banaaya he jisamen aise logon kii suvidha, sammaan or adhikaron ko dhyaan main rakhaa gaya he
 In the new law, the categories of physical and mental capacity have been increased from 7 to 21
 isamen drishtiheen, kam drushti, bauddhik aakshamata, maansik beemaari, bolne or bhashaa kii aakshamata, badhir, muscular dystrophy, acid hamale ke shikaar, parkinsons kii beemaari, thilicemia, hemophilia, otism spactrum disorder jaisi samasyaon se grast log shaamil hai
 This law says that the government and local administration will provide education to all children suffering from these problems in all educational institutions run by the government
 unhen bina kisi bhedbhaav ke daakhila degaa, sabhi ke baraabar khel or manoranjan kii suvidhaayen uplabdh karaayega
 The building will provide the campus and other facilities
 vyakti vishesh kii jarurat ke hisaab se uchit vyavastha karegaa
 Will provide necessary support for good academic and social development
 ye sunishchit karegaa ki dekh or sun paane main aksham bacchon ko unke dwaara samajhi jane vaali bhashaa or tareeke main shiksha di jaae
 In the course of learning, the problems faced by children will be understood as soon as possible and find a suitable solution
 aise bacchon ko aane-jane kii uchit suvidhaayen or sahyog degaa
 After surveying school children every five years, they will identify those children who need special support or who have any kind of disability
 aisa survey 2016 ke is kanoon ke lagu hone ke do saal ke bheetar karnaa hoga taaki aise bacchon ke liye shikshak prashikshan sansthaaon ko sthapit kiya ja sake
 The purpose of this law is to train and give jobs to teachers trained in sign language and Braille
 ab sawaal ye he ki kanoon to ban gaya he lekin is par amal kitna hota he
 Is our administrative system and our society sensitive to the feelings of people with physical disabilities
 shaareerik taur par aksham logon ko sammaan kaa vahi adhikaar he jo hamen or aapako he
 Today, the handicapped have performed in many places across the country
 inkaa kahana he ki hamaare liye arakshit naukariyaan bhi samay se nahin milti hai or na hi vekency aati hai
 The government says that the reservation of disability has been increased but where are the jobs coming
 ek acha suzav aayaa he viklangon ke liye kyon nahin alag se pariksha hoti he
 Recruitment was given at the time of elections in the railway itself, but the disabled were protesting at Mandi House in Delhi for several days about their problems
 koi unhen poochne tak nahin gaya
 One issue is about pension
 centre viklaangata pension ke liye apana hissaa kitna detii he, aap jaanakar hairaan rah jaaenge
 300 rupees only
 jabaki dilli sarkaar 2500
 Many states also have 500
 viklangon kaa kahana he ki hamen upkaran baant kar netaa photo khinchaa lete hai magar upkaran hi ekmaatr jarurat nahin hai
 We should also get an opportunity
 yah baat thik lagi kyonki haath se khinchne vaala rickshaw yaa scooter baantkar kuch madad to hoti he lekin avasaron main samanta honi chahie
 There should be equal participation in school from admission to other areas of life
 viklaangata ke saath kai bimaariyaan bhi judi hoti hai jinka kharchaa aksar bas kii baat nahin hota he
 For example, the muscular dystrophy is necessary that the RPWD Act 2016 be strictly implemented
 samaaj ko aise logon kii jaruraton ke prati samvedansheel banaaya jaae
 All government departments run programs to increase such sensitivity
 isse jude kanoon ke ulanghan ke liye sajaa or panaalty ho
 Programs should be made for the employment and rehabilitation of the affected
 shiksha dena mahaj aupchaarikta na ho, us par gambhirtha se amal kiya jaae
 And the role of not only the government but also private institutions should be ensured in this work
 dilli sarkaar ne pichley hi maheene nae act ke hisaab se Disability par research ke liye chah sadasyon kii ek rajya stareey cameti banaai he
 This committee will monitor every research related to Disability
 moulana aaazaad medical college ke dean iske cheirperson honge or ye cameti teen saal ke liye hogi
 In keeping with the directives of the same Act, the Education Department of the Delhi Government has appointed Nodal Officers in every district to look into all matters related to children with special abilities, both physically and mentally, in government schools and government assisted schools
 ye nodel officer apane tahat aane vaale sabhi skulon main daakhil aise bacchon kii timahi report shiksha nideshaalay ko bhejenge
 If former Airhostess Geetika Sharma of MDLR Airlines would not have given her life by hanging from the fan on the morning of 5 August, then former Haryana Minister of State for Home Affairs Gopal Goyal Kanda would have become an example of women empowerment in the country
 aakhir usne apni 36 companiyon main 19 mahilaon ko diarector yaa isi tarah ke oonche ohadon par bithaaya he
 He is the leader who has called a separate public meeting of women for campaigning and is the one who has never denied even the legendary heroines like Pooja Batra, Rati Agnihotri to Hema Malini to attend the gathering
 usne apane saath judi takreeban har ladki kii kismat badal di
 Someone gave a BMW car as a gift, then left the entire showroom to someone
 yah kanda kii najare inayat hi thi ki geetika jaisi kai maamuli mahilaayein karmchaaree raturaat company main oonche ohadon par pahunch gayi
 But it is not a coincidence that Kanda, who is inebriated and inebriated, has saved most of the beauties who were either unmarried or willing to leave their husbands
 1952 main jansangh ke tikat par sirsa se vidhansabha chunaav haarane vaale kattar sanghee muralidhar kanda kaa sabase bada betaa shuru se hi jaanata tha ki siyasat ke galiyaaron main kin chizon kii tuuti sabase zyada bolti he
 Leeladhar Saini, who was his associate in Kanda's adorable Tara Baba's hut, ponders a lot of thought, "the stories of cheap novels in the lines of Shkok Shastri have never descended from Gopal's mind in which women and money gain everything Examples to be done are full
 uski kitabon kii dukaan bhale hi na chali ho, lekin in kitabon ne uske dimag ko khub chalaaya
 "he is a pure broker," says Ajay Chaitala, once a political leader
 agar gaharaai se jaanch ho to yah maamla desh kaa sabase bada sex racket sabit hoga
 "but regardless of these allegations, Kanda went on a journey to earn money and the number of his royal women continued to grow
 geetika sharma, ankitha singh, nupur mehta or aruna singh to ve chand naam hai jo kanoonee pachade main ulajhane ke kaaran saarvajanik ho gaye, lekin kanda ke sansar main or bhi aisi ladkiyaan hai jinaki tarakkee kaa graph in mahilaon se miltaa he
 The fate of a girl's family in Sirsa, which saw her family's business, changed in a few years
 pehle is ladki ke parivaar kii mali haalat jahaan khasta thi, vahiin ab uske pita kaaron kaa showrooms chalaa rahe hai
 a woman in another company of Kanda reached the rank of COO very fast
 lambey samay tak kanda ke driver rahe ek shaks ne bataaya, "gudgaanv aane ke baad kanda sahab ne ek mahila secretary kii bhartee kii thi
 The secretary was clearly instructed to get the file passed, even if it had to be done
 "kamyaabi ke liye kuch bhi karnaa jaise kanda kaa mantra hi ban gaya
 Her bookstore (1979), Jupiter Electronics (1982), shoe store (1985), bottled water and shoe-making factories have failed one after the other but have never lost her spirits
 usne emdlaar airlines kholi lekin vah ghate main rahi
 Two casinos opened in Goa, they too could never run
 lekin uski jindagi or kaarobaar main ladakiyon kii sankhya badhati hi rahi
 Also, his hobbies of giving fabulous parties and prized gifts were not affected
 saini bataate hai, "maine kanda se poocha ki baari tere dhandhe to ghate main chal rahe hai, phir airlines main itani ladkiyaan kyon rakh lee hai? tu ghate ke dhandhe se hi kyon chipka rahata he
 In response, Kanda said that Saini you are a Bhagat man
 tum dhandhe kii baaten kya samajhenge
 These girls and airplanes are not to make a profit, but to reach out to influential people
 "or hua bhi kuch aisa hi
 Kanda, who left Sirsa at Tara Baba's 'order' in Gurgaon in 1997, caught the pulse of this town emerging in the real estate arena
 haryana ke purv mukhyamantri bansilaal ke bete divangat surendra singh ke kareeb aakar kanda gudgaanv ke real estate kaarobaar main chaa gaya
 If there was thunder, then Ajay Chaitala's 'shoes' should be eaten
 2003 ke baad ek samay vah bhi aayaa jab anusuchit jati ke logon ko aavantit plot ko land yuj badalakar bikwane kaa chota-motaa dhandha karne vaale kanda ke bina gudgaanv main koi bhi badi land deal karnaa naammumkin-sa ho gaya
 Her colleague Surendra Minchanawadi says, "kanda is the worm of property
 jaise koi kabadi kabad ke pahaad main se ek najar main beshkeemtee cheez pahchaan letaa he, vaise hi kanda sahi property par daanv lagaataa he
 "kanda earned money from his unmatched talent in the property business
 usne raajnneeti kii nabj samajhne main kabhi deree nahin kii
 When Kanda saw Bhupendra Singh Hooda regaining control of Haryana's throne in 2009, he immediately joined Hooda's camp
 hooda se uski dosti gaharaari tak pahunchi or mukhyamantri uski berthde party main kek khilaane pahunchane lage (dekhen box)
 Actually, the Birthday Party has been a big platform for Kanda's public relations campaign from the very beginning
 usne apni pehali badi berthde party 1998 main gudgaanv ke bristol hotel main di thi, jahaan surendra singh bhi maujuud the
 Kanda soon built his farm house in Gurgaon
 or isi farm house main uski giraftaar se pehle tak hafte main do baar shandaar partiyaan hua karti thim
 Kanda, who did not touch liquor himself, used to pour rivers of alcohol at these parties
 partiyon main shariq rahe ek shaks kii maane to yahaan bhartiya ladakiyon ke saath roosi or uzbek ladkiyaan bhi najar aati thim
 In 2009, Kanda also bought a Mint Casino in Goa, as his wealth grew
 haryana ke bade se bade raison ne jo kaam nahin kiya tha vah kanda ne kiya or casino ke udghaatan main haryana ke 40 logon ko le gaya
 The specialty of his invitation card was that air tickets to and from the card were printed
 casino party main gaye kai logon ne yah tasdik kii ki vah unki jindagi kii sabase behtareen party thi, jahaan unhone vah sara lutf uthaaya jo aam aadmi apane sapanom main sochataa he
 These two casinos of Goa 'mint' and 'casino Rio' are of special importance in the life of Kanda
 darasal, kanda apni kathith partner ankitha singh ko sirsa se dur kisi aisi jagah settle karana chahta tha, jahaan uskaa parivaar dakhal na de sake or aisi jagah kii talash goa ke casino ke rup main khatm hui
 However, Ankita continued to visit Gurgaon after this
 geetika aatmahatya cond ke baad se hi ankitha apane bachche ke saath singapore main he or ab tak police usase poochtacha nahin kar saki he
 Later, in this casino, Kanda also brought another of his old colleague Nupur Mehta
 ye noopur mehta vahi hai jinka naam kuch maheene pehle cricket match phixing vivaad main bhi aayaa tha
 kanda-nupur's relationship was volatile
 police sutron kii maane to kanda ne kaha he ki usne gudgaanv main noopur ko 500 varg gaj kaa makaan tohfe main diya tha
 But when Nupur first separated from him, in 2009, Kanda sent the goons to evacuate the house
 haalanki noopur ne aise kisi bhi tohfe kii baat se inkaar kiya he
 Kanda's misfortune would be said to have sent Geetika to Goa as well
 police kii maane to yahi kanda se najdiki ko lekar teenon mahilaon main ghamaasan shuru hua
 Nupur and Ankita had also filed a case against Geetika here
 udhar kanda kii sabase puraani raajadaar aruna chadda ko to geetika ne apane suicide note main sari khuraafaat kaa sargana bataaya he
 Aruna, the mother of a child, also lives separately from her husband
 kabhi puure emdlaar samooh ko apni ungaliyon par nachaane vaali aruna philhal jail main he or kori uskaa haal poochne bhi nahin ja rahaa he
 She is accused of being the head of the company's HR department for recruiting girls into the company and forcing them to join Kanda's handiwork
 police kanda kii is raajadaar se ek-ek raaj ugalva rahi he or kanda nyaayik hiraasat main hanuman chalisa kaa paath kar rahaa he
 In Geetika's suicide note, the word 'bad man' written for Kanda has confused her fate lines
 geetika kii maut se do din pehle kanda ne laal rang kii ek nai hammer gaadi kharidi
 On the same day, in an informal conversation with the media, he said that he has identified 24 such seats in Haryana where the Vaishya voters dominate
 in siton par vah apane pratyaashee utaaregaa or phir uski marji ke bina haryana main koi mukhyamantri nahin ban sakegaa
 That means Kanda will be the uncrowned king of Haryana's politics
 kanda kii parwaaj oonchi honi thi, lekin satta or dhan ke ahankaar main vah yah bhul gaya ki aurat koi khilonaa nahin he
 a woman can get caught in a man's entourage, but she cannot become a market ladder of progress forever
 kanda ke ehsaan tale dabe hone ke baavjood geetika ne samarpan kii bajaae khud ko khatm karnaa behatar samaj
 His death became the reason for Kanda's destruction
 rajaneta aise sabak akasar oonchi keemat chukaakar sikhte hai
 And by then it is late
 loksabhaa chunaavon kaa elaan ho chukaa he or bijepi ke baagi netaa kalyaan singh ne kuch arsa pehle hi samaajawaadee party kaa daaman thama he
 In such a situation, how can the party forget the opportunity of giving cleanliness to Muslims
 isliye party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ne darul ulum ke ulimaon ke saath mulaakaat kar loksabhaa chunaavon ke pehle apana vot bank pukhta karne kii kavayad shuru kar di he
 On the other hand, the possibility of tussle between the Congress and Samajwadi Party in the Lok Sabha elections is already visible
 sutron ke mutabik congress ne 24 ummidavaaron kii list taiyaar kar lee he jise bahut jaldi hi jari kiya jane vaala he
 It is clear that the Congress is indicating that it is not aligning at least 25 seats
 sutron ke mutabik is list main kai aise naam he jis par samaajawaadee party ko aitraaj rahaa he
 Amitabh Bachchan has resigned from the board of directors of politician Amar Singh-promoted Energy Development Company

 Love is 9 years old, something like this, according to the reports that have come from prabhas-anushka quoting Love Chemistry Sutras, it is right to demand so much money in view of its popularity in Telugu cinema, but it is stupid to ask for so much money in Bollywood 
 kisi bhi dakshin bhartiya actor, yahaan tak ki rajnikant ko bhi hindi cinema main kabhi zyada paise nahin mili
 After Baahubali and Baahubali 2, Karan wanted to launch Prabhas in Bollywood, but given the demand of Prabhas, he dropped the idea
 6000 rishte thukraa chuke hai prabhas, 2 maheene baad anoushka shetty se kar sakate hai sagaai!karan ne guuruuvaar ko ek twit bhi kiya he, jise dekhakar lagata he wo prabhas ko kuch massej dena chaahate hai

 ) saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan narendra modi kaa sabase bada vaada yahi tha ki unki sarkaar ai to vah videshi bainkon main jamaa puraa kaala dhan waapas lekar aaenge
 He had said that if this money comes back, the poor will get 15 lakhs in the same way
 narendra modi ne kaha tha, 'ham videshi bainkon main jamaa ek-ek rupaya waapas lekar aaenge or yah sunishchit karenge ki iskaa istemaal garibon kii behatari ke liye kiya jaae
 'about 1
 14 lakh karod rupee ke kaale dhan kaa khulaaspub jab ek saal ke bheetar desh phir se chunaavon kaa saamana karne ja rahaa he, ab yah jaanch karne kaa samay aa gaya he ki modi sarkaar kaale dhan ke vaade par kitna khara utari he
 Actually, overall, about 1 in the last four years
 14 lakh karod rupee ke kaale dhan kaa pataa chalaa he
 Let us see what steps the Modi government has taken in the last year to curb black money and what are the figures in different cases
 
 
 tex dekar kaala dhan jaahir karne kii yojanasarkaar kii svaichhik aay ghoshnaa yojana (IDS) or kaala dhan evam tex aropan act (BMIT Act) ke tahat kul 69,350 karod rupee kii vasuuli hui he
 Apart from this, another Rs 5,000 crore has come under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY)
 BMIT act ko sarkaar ne 2015 main lagu kiya tha
 Under this, people owning property abroad had the opportunity to whitewash their black money by paying a one-time tax
 1 july se 30 sitambar 2015 ke hi dauraan is yojana ke tahat kareeb 650 logon ne videshi bainkon main jamaa apni kul 4,100 karod rupee kii sampatti kaa khulaasa kiya
 After this, the government provided two more such methods
 pehali thi saal 2016 kii aay ghoshnaa yojana (IDS)
 Under the scheme, those who had not sincerely declared their income or assets till the last assessment year were given an opportunity to disclose it
 iske badale unki aay par 45 fisadi kaa ekamusth tex lagane kaa praavdhaan tha
 64,275 people disclosed assets worth Rs 65,250 crore under IDS
 iske baad disambar, 2016 main pradhanmantri garib kalyaan yojana shuru kii gai
 Under this, by paying a 50 percent penalty on any undisclosed income, it can be given to the government in a confidential manner and any action can be avoided
 yahi nahin, aghoshit aay ke anya 25 fisadi hissaa ko nivesh karne kaa bhi vikalp he, jo chaar saal ke baad bina byaaj ke waapas ho jaaegi
 No concrete result has been found from the note ban, it is generally considered to be a failure
 november 2016 main sarkaar ne 500 or 1000 rupee ke noton ko band kar diya
 The share of these notes was about 86 percent in the entire currency circulation
 iske peeche soch banking system se baahar ho chuke dhan ko waapas laane kii thi
 The government felt that this would bring back 10 to 11 lakh crore currency notes in the banking system
 notebandi ke samay 500 or 1000 ke kul 15
 44 lakh crore rupee notes were declared illegal
 inamen se sirf 16,000 karod rupee hi waapas nahin aae
 During the demonetisation, the Reserve Bank spent about Rs 21,000 crore on printing of new notes and repairing atms etc
 haalanki notebandi ke dauraan kul kitni rakam bainkon main waapas ai abhi iskaa antim aankada rigerv bank bataane ko taiyaar nahin he
 In this way, the government's goal of demonetisation is not fulfilled that black money will come out of the economy
 benami act main sanshodhanamodi sarkaar ne benami lenden par ankush lagane ke lihaaj se benami lenden (nishedh) adhinium 1988 main saal 2016 main sanshodhan kiya
 Under this, the Income Tax Department set up 24 Benami Prohibition Units across the country
 vitt rajya mantri shiv pratap shukla ke mutabik 30 june, 2018 tak 4,300 karod rupee mulya ke 1600 se zyada benami lenden kii proviginal taur par kurki kii gai
 In order to curb money laundering on black money coming through Mauritius, the Government of India entered into a Double Accused Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with Mauritius
 iske alaava general anti awidence rules (GAAR) bhi laayaa gaya, jo 1 april, 2017 se lagu hua
 GAAR also prohibits transactions from other countries for tax evasion
 10 may, 2016 ko morishas ke saath hone vaale doharaa kar arapen bachaav samjhaute main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 Now the government can levy tax on capital gains arising from the sale or transfer of shares of an Indian company owned by a resident of Mauritius
 morishas se aane vaale kaale dhan ko rokane kii disha main yah prabhavi kadam he
 Agreement with Swiss banks The National Bank of Switzerland has agreed to share information about Indian account holders with the Indian government from September 2019
 is bare main 22 november, 2016 ko swiss neshnal bank se sarkaar ne ek samjhauta kiya he
 Under this, information of account number, name, address, date of birth, tax identification number, interest, dividend, amount in account etc
 will be given to the Indian account holder
 swiss bainkon main kaale dhan ke bare main paraspar virdohi daawey aae hai
 First came the figure that in 2017, black money of Indians in Swiss banks has increased by 50%
 iske baad kendriya mantri piyush goyal ne daawa kiya ki 2017 main swiss bank khaaton main bharatiyon ke non-bank lone or diposit main 35 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 According to the government, in the year 2017, 52 non-bank deposits of Indians in these banks
 4 karod dollar tak rah gaya he
 The amount of such deposits in the year 2014 2
 23 arab dollar thi
 But the question is, have Indians stopped sending black money abroad? If not, where is their money going? Increase in the number of taxpayers In the last four years, the number of income tax payers has doubled and tax collections have increased by 50 per cent during this period

 Due to this, about 50 flights going from India to Europe, America and middle-eastern countries are delayed by about 10 to 15 minutes

 aakhir, kya hota he kisi desh kaa hawaii kshetra
 How is the air route determined? How is the airspace of a country Whenever it is about the boundaries of a country, then the land, water and sky that come within its boundaries are discussed
 hawaii kshetra ko samajhane ke liye pehle hamen jalseema ko jaananaa hoga
 22 of all countries off its ground
 2 kimi dur samudr main adhikaar hota he
 This is called Jalseema
 kisi bhi desh ke jal or thalsima ke upar ke akashiya kshetra ko airspes (hawaii kshetra) kehete hai
 The country that owns the airspace decides who can pass through its airspace and who does not
 jameen se oonchai or upyog ke aadhaar par hawaii kshetra ko vibhinn shreniyon main baanta gaya he
 These are - controlled airspace, uncontrolled airspace, special use airspace and restricted airspace
 niyantrit hawaii kshetra main udaan bharne vaale vimaanon kaa niyantran air trephic control (ATC) karata he
 It is divided according to height into categories A, B, C, d and E
 aniyantrit hawaii kshetra main udne vaale vimaanon ko atisi nirdesh nahin detaa he
 In this, the pilot controls the aircraft according to its appearance
 yah jameen se kam oonchai par hota he
 The military uses special-use airspace
 pratibandhit airspes main koi vimaan udaan nahin bhar saktaa
 This often happens atop historic buildings and security installations
 kaise tay kiya jaataa he ki kis raste se udega hawaii jahajjo airport ke bich jab koi vimaan udata he uske raste ko hawaii maarg yaa air root kehete hai
 But this only applies to commercial flights
 nijee vimaan, paryatak vimaan, sainya vimaan ek jagah se udakar usee jagah waapas jate hai
 This is called out-and-bank trip
 lekin do deshon main maujuud hawaii addon ke bich hawaii maarg tay karne ke kuch maanak hote hai
 The first and most important standard is distance
 udaan shuru karne vaale sthaan se udaan ke gantavy sthaan tak sabase kam hawaii duuri vaale maarg ko chunaa jaataa he
 Then let's see how the weather on this route is? What will be the speed of the wind? What will be the distance to the nearest airport in emergency time? There is no dispute in the land or aquatic area falling under the airspace
 jab sabhi maanakon par khara utarane ke baad hi maarg ko chunaa jaataa he
 These routes pass over many countries
 isliye kisi bhi vimaan ko un sabhi deshon kii anumati leni padati he, jinke upar se vah gujarata he
 Actor Salman Khan is not going to leave any stone unturned for his film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' and this is the reason that an Eid song has been specially kept in this film to be released on the occasion of Eid
 salmaan khanis gane kii video shooting main hi vyast hai or agle hafte tak yah gaanaa relies ho jayega
 The lyrics of this song are 'aaj Ki Party Meri Pyaare Se', in which Salman Khankhas will be seen congratulating Eid

 It is composed by Pritam and written by Shabbir Ahmed

 Kabir Khan told the newspaper 'mumbai Mirror', 'the motive behind this song is to celebrate the festival of Eid
 yah ganofilmamen nahin hoga lekin aap salmaan or karina ko is gane par thirakate hue jarur dekhenge
 Even before this, Salman Khan has been in the Eid special song 'mubarak Eid Mubarak' in the film Tumko Nahin Tohgi
 unka yah gaanaa bhi kaaphi hit sabit hua tha

 The BJP government led by Manohar Lal Khattar has decided to increase the salary of the state's sanitation workers to help the Dalits
 iske alaava paal gadriya samudaay ko pichhadaa varg se nikaal kar anusuchit jati (SC) main shaamil kar bada daanv chalaa he
 Both these demands had been coming up in Haryana for a long time
 bataa den ki haryana main paal gadriya jati mul rup se sansy samudaay kii sab-cast he
 In Haryana, the Sansi community is included in the Scheduled Caste, while its sub-cast, Pal Gadaria, was placed in the Other Backward Classes
 paal gadriya samudaay ke log kaaphi lambey samay se anusuchit jati main shaamil kiye jane kii maang kar rahe the
 In 2016, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar promised to include Ghadria in the SC on Ahilya Bai Holkar Jayanti, which is now implemented
 SC jati main paal-gadriya samajaharyana kii khatter sarkaar ne is maamle ko lekar ek cameti kaa gathan kiya tha
 Following the recommendations of the committee, the state government has decided to bring the Pal Gadaria fraternity out of the backward classes and join the Scheduled Castes
 siem khatter ne kaha ki paal gadriya samaaj anusuchit jati main shaamil mul jati or up jati ko alag-alag shreniyon main shaamil kiye jane se is samudaay ke log duvidha main the
 Their demand was justified, which the government has fulfilled
 haryana main paal-gadriya jati kii aabaadi kareeb 20 lakh maani jaati he
 This community has not received any special attention in the state politics
 itnaa hi nahin paal-gadriya samaaj se koi saansad yaa vidhayak nahin ban sakaa he
 In such a situation, the Khattar government has taken the stance of correcting its political equation by fulfilling their very old demand

 This increase will benefit about 28 thousand cleanliness workers in cities and about 11 thousand cleaning workers in villages
 safai karmchaaree ke taur par badi aabaadi dalit samudaay kii he, jinhen saadhane ke liye khatter ne chunaav se pehle bada daanv chalaa he

 achaanak hi sonia gandhi ne netritv se jude apane tevar ko aakraamak kar diya he
 Whether it is the coal scam or the Assam government's way of dealing with the violence, Sonia is enthusiastically handling the party's defense
 28 agast kii unki dincharya dekhie, jis din pradhanmantri manmohan singh iran ke liye ravaanaa hue
 He started the morning by addressing the Congress Parliamentary Party meeting in Parliament and called on mps to "get up, fight, fight with purpose and fight aggressively"
 ’’ loksabhaa sthagit kiye jane ke baad sonia sidhe mulaayam singh yadav ke paas pahunchin
 Talked with him for 10 minutes and ended the conversation by saying 'namaste' and 'thank you'
 agle din uttar pradesh kii sapa sarkaar ne raibareli or amethi ke liye 24 ghante bijli aapurti kii ghoshnaa kar daali
 Later that day when Parliament was adjourned, Sonia did not go back to her fort of 10 Janpath as per her habit, but instead reached the Central Hall
 vahaan unhone ambika soni or anya mahila saansadon ke saath ek ghanta guzaara
 There he also had a private conversation with Lalu Prasad Yadav
 is ekant baatcheet ke thodi hi der baad, lalu ne yah aarope lagaate hue bijepi par hamalaa kiya ki is party ke netaaon ne ‘’(rishwat main) rendoi bandhuon se motaa maal liya he
 After this, Sonia spent 10 minutes discussing the Parliament crisis with SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav
 yahaan tak ki is kam bolne vaale rajyasabha saansad ke chehre par muskaraahat laane main bhi ve safal raheen
 He then attended a meeting of the Executive of the Party Parliamentary Party and expressed his concern about the pending Bills
 unhone bijepi saansad kirti aaazaad ko bhi chaay ke liye sansad main apane karyaalay main aanmatrit kiya
 Azad came up to him in the Lok Sabha on August 28 and asked about his health
 iske baad jald hi donon ‘indira buaa’ (aaazaad indira gandhi ko yahi kehete hai) ke bare main baatcheet karne lage
 This brought a smile to Sonia's face and she invited Azad for tea so that they could carry on the conversation
 congress ne apni netaa ko sansadeey raajnneeti main aisi sakriyata ke saath ruchi lete pehle kabhi nahin dekha
 this is due to
 sonia ke pasandida shantidoot pranab mukherjee sarkaar kaa prabandhan sanbhaalane ke liye ab maujuud nahin hai
 Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, who was appointed as the Leader of the House, seems to be relatively mild
 duusari qatari main aisa koi netaa nahin he, jise ve samasya ke samaadhaan kaa jimmaa saunp saken
 His chosen contender for this task, Rahul Gandhi, has not yet indicated his intention to take the leadership
 yahaan tak ki 8 agast ko jab adwani ne upie sarkaar ko ‘avaidh’ qaraar diya, sonia ne bahut aakraamak tevar dikhaae or apni party ke saansadon se bhaajapa par hamalaa karne ko kaha
 Rahul was present in the House at that time, but he did not join the raga he had waged in the party's monologue
 ve koyala ghotaale ke mudde par bhi spasht rup se shant bane hue hai
 Later, on the occasion of Rajiv Gandhi's birth anniversary, when the media fiercely questioned Sonia about her son's 'big role' plans, Raa was not there
 media ke sawaalon par sonia kii tyoriyaan chadh gayi or unhone koi jawaab nahin diya
 According to a senior Congress general secretary, Rahul's major role will not be in the government but will be limited to the party
 in mahasachiv ke anusaar, ‘’unhen aisa bada pad diya jayega, jisamen saare mahasachiv unhen report kiya karenge, or rahul sidhe congress adhyaksh ko report karenge
 However, he believes that no time-limit has been set for this yet
 ve kandhe uchakaate hue kehete hai, ‘’yah faisla parivaar ko karnaa he
 During this time, whether the matter is to pacify the angry Virbhadra Singh, or to visit the relief camps in Assam, the burden of leadership has fallen directly on Sonia's shoulders
 party ke jin saansadon ko manmohan kaa girtaa graph or rahul kii chuppi najar aati he, unhen sonia ke haal hi main najar aae josh se bharosa miltaa he
 Recently, a Lok Sabha MP who met Sonia asked about her illness in gestures and when Sonia claimed "all is well now", she was comforted

 Chidambaram told Congress mps the "real facts" of the coal scam at the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation to avoid media glare

 This leadership story also has a sequel: Priyanka Gandhi has recently been given the task of managing her mother's constituency

 It is evident from the very active political activism of mother and sister that Rahul is lacking in initiative
 punjab vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aane main bas ab kuch vakt hi baaki he, lekin eczit pole main kuch had tak tasviir saaf hoti dikhaai de rahi he
 According to which Congress can form government in Punjab
 lekin kai eczit pols punjab main aam aadmi party kii bahumat kii sarkaar kaa daawa bhi kar rahe hai
 So some exit polls are suggesting a collision between the two
 lekin ek tasviir jo sabhi eczit pole main saaf he wo ye ki akali dal or bijepi kaa punjab main supada saaf hone vaala he
 After the exit poll results, the Aam Aadmi Party of Kameha is expected to win in Punjab, and amid the preparations for the counting of votes on March 11, there will be confusion within the party as to who should crown the crown in Punjab
 koun-koun hai taj ke daavedaar ?tikat baantne or chunaav prachaar ke dauraan hi aam aadmi party ke nami chehron kii ek tasviir saaf dikhti thi, jo bhavishya main party ke liye sambhavit chehre ho sakate the
 But in the current situation, four big names are in the discussion, among the party's MP from Sangrur and Bhagwant Mann, who is contesting against Sukhbir Badal from Jalalabad, comes first
 yani agar aam aadmi party punjab main chunaav jeet jaati he to bhagwant maan mukhyamantri pad kii res main sabase aage hai
 So there is another name of famous lawyer HS Phoolka
 jo dilli ke 84 ke dangon ke maamle main peediton ke vakil hai or arvind kejariwal ke behad kareebi hai
 Not only this, Kejriwal himself had revealed that Phulka taught him to write Gurmukhi before the Punjab elections

 Who is a lawyer in Chandigarh and contested against Bikram Majithia
 chauthe number par party ke punjab ke mukhiya gurprit ghuggi hai, jo punjabi kalakaar bhi hai or aakhri naam jo res main he wo jaranel singh hai
 Who resigned as MLA of Aam Aadmi Party from Rajouri Garden in Delhi and resigned from Lambi and contested against Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal
 chunaav keam aadmi partyin paanch naamon main se kisi ek par daanv laga sakati he
 According to party sources, only such a name will come forward for the post of Chief Minister, which is popular in Punjab and whose acceptance among the public
 is paimaane par maapne ke baad hi aam aadmi party or arvind kejariwal punjab main kisi ko taj pahanaaenge

 After BJP, Shiv Sena now has a chance to form government
 sameekaran aise hai ki shivasena ko ensipi or congress kaa samarthan hi maharashtra ko nai sarkaar de saktaa he
 The NCP had laid a condition for support, which the Shiv Sena has accepted
 aise main ab sabaki najar congress ke ection par he
 In fact, no party could get an absolute majority in the results of the Maharashtra Assembly elections that came on 24 October
 288 vaali vidhansabha main bijepi 105, shivasena 56, ensipi 54 or congress ko 44 siten milin
 Despite the BJP and Shiv Sena coalition having enough seats, the two parties clashed over the CM post-sharing and the government could not be formed
 ab bijepi akele pad gai he or shivasena ko ensipi-congress gathbandhan kaa sahyog milane kii puri ummid kii ja rahi he
 On Thursday, the BJP refused to form the government, telling the Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari that it was not able to form the government on its own
 bijepi ke is nirnay ke baad rajyapal ne duusari sabase badi party shivasena ko sarkaar banane ke liye poocha, jiske baad ensipi or congress ke samarthan kii charchaa tej ho gai
 The NCP publicly stipulated that the Shiv Sena would have to pull out of the NDA for support and resign from the cabinet
 yani shivasena ko bijepi kaa puri tarah se saath chhodana padegaa
 After this condition of NCP, Minister Arvind Sawant announced his resignation from Shiv Sena quota in Modi cabinet on Monday morning
 is tarah ensipi ne samarthan ke liye jo shart rakhi, use shivasena ne maan liya
 Now in the hands of Congress, Bajishivasena may have accepted the condition of NCP, but the support of Congress is also necessary for the formation of government

 Former Finance Minister P
 chidambaram ne do saal pehle purv ipel kamishnar lalit modi ko nirvasit kiye jane kii maang karte hue england ko chitthee likhi thi
 NDTV wrote this letter to Chidambaram in August 2013 to his British counterpart George Osbourne
 soochna ke adhikaar kanoon ke tahat mili is chitthee main chidambaram ne kaha tha ki bharat lalit modi ko pratyrpit karne kii maang nahin kar rahaa, jisamen akasar hi lanbaa samay lagata he, balki ham britain se unhen nirvasit karne kii maang karte hai
 In this letter, Chidambaram said that the former IPL commissioner was being investigated by competent authorities for potentially serious crimes in India
 tatkaaleen vittamantri ne kaha, 'main is baat se chintit hum ki unka (lalit modi) parsport vidhivat rup se radd kiya gaya he, natijatan unke paas ab koi vaid yatra dastavej bhi nahin hai, lekin iske baavjood unhen adhikariyon dwaara euke main rukne kii ijaajat di ja rahi he
 'along with this, Chidambaram also said that around 3000 Indians have been deported by the UK who did not have any valid documents like Lalit Modi

 In this letter received under the Right to Information Act, Chidambaram said that India is not seeking extradition of Lalit Modi, which often takes a long time, but we demand the UK to deport him

 yun to koi bhi maa-baap apane bachche ko kahin bhi akele chhodkar janaa pasand nahin karte hai lekin kai baar paristhiyaan aisi ho jaati hai ki unhen bachche ko ghar par akele chhodkar janaa padataa he
 However, the parents leave the child alone in the same condition when he himself is convinced that his child has become sensible and can handle himself for some time
 baavjood iske bachche ko ghar par akelaa chhodkar janaa kisi musiibat se kam nahin he
 In such a situation, by taking care of some important things, you can reduce your anxiety to some extent
 1
 Do leave a mobile with the child so that he keeps informing you from time to time and you also keep checking for him from time to time
 2
 Give the child some required emergency number so that he can help in case of any untoward incident
 3
 Do not lock the child in any corner or room of the house
 varanaa koi anhoni hone par wo baahar hi nahin nikal paaegaa
 4
 bachche ko apane saamne darwaja band karnaa or kholana sikhaaen
 Also tell him that instead of placing the top latch, he should put the bottom latch
 5
 Keep the food and drink of the child on the dining table so that he does not go to the kitchen when he is hungry

 Even if there is no homework, go and give him some creative work, so that his time will also pass quickly and he will not do anything which can prove to be dangerous

 Rahul Gandhi does not believe in 'vengeance'
 unke liye is baat kaa kabhi koi mahatv nahin rahaa ki unke pita ke hatyaron ko dand mili
 The grief of the death of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in a suicide bombing of the LTTE on May 21, 1991, which has been going on for 23 years, is indeed of a personal nature
 ve kehete hai, ''main pita ko kho chukaa hum

 After Jayalalithaa expressed her intention to waive the sentence of the seven convicts in the Rajiv murder case, the fantasy of seeing her father's killers on holiday was also unbearable
 jahiraa taur par pareshaan congress upaadhyaksh ne amethi kii ek chunavi raily main kaha bhi, ''jab ek pradhanmantri ke hatyaron ko reeha kiya ja rahaa ho to ek aam aadmi kya ummid kar saktaa he?”haalanki rajeev ke hatyaron kii rihaai ke khilaaf 20 farvari ko centre sarkaar ke supreme court pahunchane ke baad unki kismat par faisla abhi tal gaya he
 But now the Lok Sabha elections which have come to the head have drawn our attention to a bitter truth: the contradiction present in the public consciousness of India
 jin hatyaron ko baaki desh main aatankwaadi ke rup main dekha jaataa he, ve hi tamilnadu main unki vakaalat karne vaale netaaon ke vot badha sakate hai
 What else could be better than Jayalalitha's eating this upside down? After vocal opposition to the LTTE for years, she is now engaged in the release of Murugan, progeny, Perarivalan, Robert Pius, Jayakumar, Ravichandran and Nalini
 unke alaava unke kattïr pratidwandvi em

 In fact, a court in Chandigarh ordered the officials of the Patiala jail to hang Balwant Singh Rajoana, a terrorist of Babbar Khalsa International

 a few days ago, Akal Takht Jathedar Gurbachan Singh declared Rajoana a 'living martyr' and issued a fatwa to stop work from Sikhs, wear saffron and perform ardas for the life of that terrorist in a rare order
 ek alag sikh rajya kii maang kaa ab bhi samarthan kar rahe chand logon ke alaava, thode-se amuman shant rahane vaale sikhon ne bhi is par hinsak pratikriya jataai
 Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal went to the court of President Pratibha Patil to keep fresh views on the terror case, after sensing the growing support for Rajoana and the deteriorating law and order situation
 shiromani gurudwara prabandhak cameti adhyaksh avatar singh makkad kii ore se pesh dayaa yachika par kendriya grih mantralay ne 31 march ko tay uski faansee par roak laga di
 Rajoana, who himself confessed to his role in the assassination of Beant Singh, refused to appeal against the hanging

 He is not worried at all
 akaal takht se samarthan ke baad use pataa he ki beant singh ke marane kii baat ke puraani padate jane ke saath 'jinda shahid’ kii uski chhavi majboot hi hoti jaaegi
 He calls the ban on his hanging a 'victory of the Sikh nation'

 Although his death sentence and later his confirmation by the president in May 2011 did not react as it did in the Rajoana case, the pressure created by radical Sikh groups to pardon him showed its effect
 
 26 farvari ko centre sarkaar ne supreme court ko suchit kiya ki bhullar ke 'kharaab maansik swasthya’ ko dekhte hue use faansee dene kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 Earlier, on January 6, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Najeeb Jung recommended his death sentence be changed to life imprisonment

 Rahul Gandhi, who is being projected as the future Prime Minister of the Congress, believes that only a few people see the killers of Beant Singh or Rahul's father himself, or Afzal Guru as a hero or martyr
 ve jor dekar kehete hai ki kashmiri ek alag sawaal puch rahe hai
 Drawing attention again to Jayalalithaa's attempt to free her father's killers, he says, "is the law one or not?" They are asking this question
