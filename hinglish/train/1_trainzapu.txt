 Talking about the upcoming Punjab elections, Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal said that he does not want to become the next Chief Minister of Punjab, Prakash Singh Badal will be the next Chief Minister
 sukhbir singh badal kaa kahana he ki hamaara muqabla congress se he, aam aadmi party se nahin
 The Aam Aadmi Party is nowhere to be seen in Punjab because with the manner in which the Aam Aadmi Party has worked in Delhi, people have come to know that the Aam Aadmi Party cannot deliver
 unke vidhayak lagaataar jail ja rahe hai, unki kathani or kerani main kaaphi fark he
 Sutlej is not an election, emotional issue: Sukhbir Badal says on Kejriwal's statement that drug is a big issue, all this confusion is being spread, i am being falsely accused

 Regarding Navjot Singh Sidhu, Sukhbir Singh Badal says that he is a comedian, does not take the people of Punjab seriously and wherever he gets a higher rate, he talks on whether it is Kejriwal or Congress

 Children's classes are taking place in broken rooms and in warehouses and these people are just changing names
 bacchon ne mujhe apni samasya bataane ke liye bulaayaa tha
 i kept my point but the college did not listen to anyone
 dayaal singh college ke principal pawan sharma ne is maamle par kaha ki vande maataram naam rakhane main koi aapatti nahin he
 He said that the names of all the colleges are in the name of such people, which no one knows
 vande maataram desh ko ek sutara main pirone vaala shabd he
 No one should object to its name

 mujhe samaj nahin aata ki anna hajaare isse inkaar kyon kar rahe hai
 "she has denied that she is trying to create conflict between Anna Hazare's associates

 " In a news report that hurt his family before China Premier Wen Jiabao retired from politics, it was alleged that his family had at least 2

 Most of this nine-month deferment is used by Shah to repair the party's strength
 unke deshvyapee daure kuch vaise hi hai, jaise military commander apni maidani tukdiiyon kii vyuharachna dekhne jate hai
 In these tours, he not only instills confidence among the partymen but also examines the ground situation

 The blistering increase from two seats in 1984 to 85 seats in 1989 and finally to 182 seats in 1999 was based on issues such as the Ram Mandir movement

 The BJP could win only seven seats from these states, while these 159 mps are elected and sent
 nai bhaajapashah jab dilli main hote hai or apane 11 akbar road ke ghar se baahar nikalate hai, tab unki nazren teen shakhsiyaton kii sepia rang se ukeri gai painting se guzarati hai
 Of these, only one is associated with the union
 rajnatik darshanik chanakya, jinhone isa purv chathi shatabdi main maury samrajya kii neenv rakhi thi; darshanik aadi shankaracharya, jinhone 8veen sadi main hindu dharm ke punarjagran kii aguai kii thi; or vinayak saavarkar, jinhone hindutv kii us vichaardhaara ko janm diya jo bhaajapa or uski matra sanstha rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa marm he
 They try to draw the lessons of religion, governance and ideology of these three mystics in rebuilding the party
 agali peedi ke netaaon ko gadhia shah kii sabase badi praathamiktaaon main se ek he
 It is also the work that gives them the most motivation and strength
 ve baar-baar jor dekar kehete hai ki kis tarah bhaajapa akeli rashtriya party he jisamen booth str kaa kaaryakarta bhi party kaa adhyaksh banane kaa sapana dekh saktaa he
 a new plant of new generation leaders emerged in the state BJP in Uttar Pradesh elections
 shah ne dhara ke khilaaf jaakar bhi mukhyamantri kii kursi ke liye yogi adityanath kaa samarthan kiya
 Party sources say that Shah has identified about 270 leaders, all under the age of 40, as future leaders
 in naamon kii unhone kisi ko bhanak tak nahin lagane di he
 They want to increase this list to over 400 names
 shah rajya ke ahm padaadhikariyon ke saath aksar maathapai karte hai or harek rajya ko kshetravaar alag-alag baant lete hai
 a prominent leader of each state presents a detailed analysis based on questions sent to Shah
 90 minute kii baithak ke aakhir main shah aankate hai ki koun-se badlaav jaruri hai
 These open meetings they conduct with full domination and openness
 party sanghathan main padaadhikariyon kii niyukti sareekhe latake hue kaamon ke liye ve niyukt karne vaale adhikari kii manjuuri se aakhri samay seemaa tay kar dete hai or phir amal nahin hone kii haalat main karrwai kii dhamkee pesh kar dete hai
 Among the 10 projects that Shah started after taking over as party president, the party also had to raise the party anew from a very low level
 pehle charan main sabhi 670 party jilon main daftar bananaa tha
 In 2014, only 114 district units had their offices
 aaj 30 nae jila daftar taiyaar hai or 388 kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 At each state and district headquarters, there are projects to build a library of books on the government, Indian history, that state or district and constitution
 party ke vibhaagon or pariyojnaon ke prabharee arvind menon or ity vibhaag ke sanyojak malviya kii ek team rajya ke dauron main shah ke saath jaati he or tamaam pariyojnaon kii pragati kaa jayja leti he
 An important election strategy for 2019 is to field a force of 3,75,000 expansors
 yah anshkalik svaichhik kaaryakarta honge jo aam chunaavon tak party kii khatir boothon ko majboot karne ke kaam ke liye apane 15 din denge
 Apart from this, a separate army of four thousand expansors has been assigned to fixed assembly constituencies across the country from May this year to add to the party's prospects before the Lok Sabha elections
 shah ne khajaanjiyon, party pravaktaaon or sthaneey nirvaachit nikaayon ke chune hue numaayindon ke liye kaam par aadhaarit prashikshan kii shuruyaat kii he
 The national general secretary of the party, Muralidhar Rao, says, "the scale and the speed at which training is going on is unprecedented
" '' shah kii nai siyaasi kaary samskruti main tamaam staron par 10 lakh kaaryakartaaon ko nishchit kaamon kaa prashikshan diya gaya he
 This training structure has three levels — 24-hour organization training to Mandal level workers under which 7,500 camps have been organized in one and a half years, two days camp for district level workers and three days for state level party workers Camp
 prashikshan samiti ke sadsy aar
 According to Balashankar, ideology, history and goals of the party, economic policy, relationship with media and synergy between party and government are part of the training course
 itnaa hi nahin, shah chaahate hai ki unke party kaaryakartaaon ke paas ghoomane or jude rahane ke saadhan hon
 In one meeting, he raised his hands about how many of the 139 party extensionists owned smartphones and motorcycles
 phir unhone sthaneey party netaaon ko jarurat puri karne ke nirdesh die
 Shah's plan is to prepare and train the party in such a way that the dangers of the Grand Alliance and anti-incumbency do not make any sense, especially against the run-up to his booth management strategy
 unke chatursujan gathbandhanon kii vajah se hui tarakkee gaur karne laayak he
 Ramnath Kovind was supported by 44 parties in the presidential election thanks to the skills of Modi and Shah
 isse pehle shah kii aguai main endie kii ek baithak main 33 partiyon ne hissaa liya tha
 He says, "if you follow this mantra, you will not have to fear anyone other than your destiny
" koi bhi gathbandhan ho yaa anti-inakambency, aap shandaar antar se jitkar aaenge
 Soon after taking over the work, Shah created 19 new departments, assigned him a charter of work and set goals
 aisa kaam pehle bhi kiya jaataa rahaa tha, par keval tabhi jab jarurat padati thi
 Now there is a department for election management, and there is also a department for coordination with the Election Commission
 soshal media ko sanbhaalane ke liye alag mahakama he jisane bhaajapa kii bahari pahunch ko naatakeey dhang se sudhara or badhaayaa he
 Then there is the possibility of the party's coordination with the central government, then there is also the department for research on policies
 misaal ke liye, party kaa svachh bharat mahakama party kaaryakartaaon se swatchta abhiyaanon main bhaag lene kii guzarish karata he
 General Secretary Bhupendra Yadav says, "amitabhai has given BJP a new edge of ideology
 agar piem nae bharat kaa lakshya lekar chal rahe hai, to amitbhai ek nai bhaajapa ko dekh rahe hai jo unke vijan kii barabari kar sake
 The rejuvenation they are doing includes everything from improvement and transparency in the way the party works, to the party's well-developed development and permanent infrastructure
 ''phir bhi shah kii maha chunavi ranneeti ke aage kuch dikkatein hai
 The biggest concern in the party is the slow economic growth, the employment crisis and the impact of demonetisation and GST on the unorganized sector
 duusari rajnatik partiyon ke netaaon ke swaagat se bhaajapa main asantosh bhi he
 a section of senior party leaders is also feeling isolated
 iske alaava shah bataur adhyaksh apane teen saal ke kaarykaal main padaadhikariyon kii puri team bhi nahin bana paae hai
 This makes them dependent on the same officials whose work they are not satisfied with
 ek jaankaar ke mutabik bengal, kerala, tamilnadu se bhi bade chunavi laabh kii ummid nahin he
 In such a situation, if someone goes wrong, Shah will be aware of this

 The Internet world does not care about your religious beliefs
 magar ab ek aisa search ingine banaaya gaya he, jo islam ke kaayadon ke mutabik search karegaa
 http: / / halalgoogling
 comnama ke is search ingine ko is tarah se dizin kiya gaya he ki isamen vahi rigelt aaen, jinamein islam ke hisaab se haraam content na ho
 Recently, this search engine was started in Pakistan
 musalamaanon ke istemaal ke liye banaaya gaya ye search ingine google or bing jaise search injanon kii madad se hi kaam karata he
 Actually, as soon as you find a word in halalgoogling
 ye google jaise search ingine se rigelt uthaata he or phir unako apane filter system se gujaarta he
 It is a software, in which according to Islam, whatever sites, things, words and statements are forbidden, it excludes them from the results
 aise main halaalagugling ke yujar ko sirf halaal content hi miltaa he
 Porn sites can not be viewed through halalgoogling
 iske alaava samalanginkon ke bare main bhi isamen koi search nahin kii ja sakati
 In Islam, gambling is also considered as haraam
 isliye halaalagugling ke jariye jue yaa satte se judi kisi site ko bhi nahin khoja ja saktaa he
 This site claims that four things have made its haraam filtering system special
 isamen ek general katigari filtering he, jo content ko filter karti he taaki haraam material nikaala ja sake
 The second aspect is that of forbidden sites
 search rigelt main kabhi aisi cites na aaen, jinamein gandi chijen dikhaai bataai jaati hai, iske liye ek blaclist bani he aisi websites kii
 Then a step is also placed for link filtering
 taaki search main aa rahi kisi site main agar koi link yaa pej haraam he, to use hataakar baaki content disple kiya jaae
 And finally, its killer feature
 haraam kii vards kii pahchaan karne vaala
 There are two ways of operation
 pehla, haraam shabdon kii search hi na ho
 Second, even if there is a search, the results of the entire web should not be displayed
 par kya vaaki site kaa daawa durust haiye to hui theory kii baat
 Now practical view
 agar halaalagugling par porn, plaboy
 If you search for a picture of Mohammed or the reincarnation of Jesus, then only one message will shine on the screen
 koi nateeja nahin yaa phir aapane haraam saamagree kii khoj kii he
 But if the site is inserted, then the user will get website ke dhaave kii dhajjiyaan udaane ke liye kuch logon ne ek artical isi search ke jariye khoj dikhaaya
 In it, a model named Kate sat on a horse in an almost naked style
 iske baad site ke sanyojakon ne safai di ki ‘ham puri koshish kar rahe hai
 But as of now, search engines cannot be completely haram proof
 bahut kuch kiya janaa baaki he
 We will be able to do this with Allah's will and your help
 ’site banane waalon ko yakeen he ki ek din ye search ingine har muslim bhai bahan ke kaam aayega
 It has been written on the blog of the site that if some wrong results come up during the search, then forgive us
 ham bhi insaan hai or sirf allaah hi galtiyaan nahin karata
 Pakistani reporter Chand Nawab, who made headlines with his character in the film Bajrangi Bhaijaan, is once again in the news for his reporting
 unki reporting kaa ek video viral ho rahaa he
 In this video, he often forgets the lines while reporting
 jiske baad unhen ek ke baad ek kai tech lene padate hai
 1
 46 minute ke is video main bhi wo apni reporting puri nahin kar pate
 In this, he is seen reporting related to the pan of Karachi
 unka yah video soshal media par jamkar share kiya ja rahaa he
 In which some people are appreciating their dedication towards their work
 vahiin kuch log unki reporting ke is andaaj kaa lutf lete hue unhen kamedian jarnlist bataa rahe hai
 Chand Nawab rocks yet again but this time not for 'apno mein Eid manane'pic
 twitter
 com / 6mgbmrr5bt — Fazil Jamili (@faziljamili) June 28, 2018 Actually, Chand Nawab is a reporter for a Pakistani news channel and has made headlines earlier due to his reporting
 isse pehle railway stesan par unke dwaara kii gai reporting ko logon ne bade chaav se dekha tha
 This video of him went viral
 wo ek railway stesan ke paas reporting kar rahe the or is dauraan unhen vahaan se guzar rahe logon kii vajah se pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 He was so upset that he had to take retake too many times
 chand nawab kaa purana video
 
 
 He is the same Chand Nawab whose character was portrayed in the Indian film Bajrangi Bhaijaan
 is film main abhinayta navazuddin siddiki ne railway stesan par inke kirdaar main acting kii thi or logon ko unka yah andaaj khub pasand aayaa tha
 This scene was one of the highlights of the film
 aam aadmi party ne shanivaar ko apana menifesto jari kiya, jisamen bijli kii daren aadhi karne or muft pani muhaiyaa karaane samet 70 tarah kii ghoshnaaen party ne kin
 The special thing that caught my attention is that the party did not set any deadline to fulfill the promise
 jaise pichley chunaavon main party ne elaan kiya tha ki sarkaar banane ke 15 din ke bheetar ramlila maidan main lokapal bill paas kiya jayega yaa phir salbhar main
 But first the government was late and then the bill was delayed
 lokapal bill paas to kya hota, vidhansabha main rakhaa hi nahin ja sakaa or mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne sarkaar se istipha de diya
 Not only this, the UPA Government of Delhi and the Kejriwal Government of Delhi were so stunned on the Delhi Lokpal Bill that the Central Government said that first send the bill to the Center and keep it in the Assembly only with the approval, but the Kejriwal Government was adamant and the bill without approval Tried to present in sadan main bill pesh nahin ho paaya or kejariwal ne istipha de diya
 This time if the Aam Aadmi Party comes to power, what will it do and how will it do? Because the first promise of 'AAP' in the manifesto is from Lokpal, but this time the party has not given any deadline on it
 'aap' kii menifesto kamity ke pramukh ashish khetaan se jab is mudde par poocha gaya, to unhone kaha ki ham is baar dedline dekar bematlab kaa vivaad nahin karnaa chaahate, kyonki maan lijie ki agar 15 din main kaam nahin ho paata he, to anaavashyak samasya hoti he or dabaav ban jaataa he
 
 
 We will try to do all the work as soon as possible
 
 
 aap kah sakate he ki ham nae hai or apni galatiyon se sikh rahe hai
 Will you government clash with the Center this time on Lokpal? Khaitan has clearly said that whatever will be in the constitution, we will follow it only
 yani party agar sarkaar main aati he to bematlab ke takaraav se ab bachanaa chaahegi
 It is clear that this party, which was in a hurry before, is now learning politics, so avoiding deadlines and conflicts, it is talking about changing Delhi in five years
 vah samaj rahi he ki raajnneeti aise hi hoti he
 Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar shared a picture with legendary Australian cricketer Sir Don Bradman on Thursday morning

 # nostalgiaa post shared by Sachin Tendulkar (@sachintendulkar) onapr 27, 2017 at 12:54am pdt90wein janmdin par mili the sachinbreadman ke 90wein janmdin par tendulkar unase unke edilade sthit awaas par mili the
 Bradman later included him in his all-time XI

 The biggest players have been the 99 best in Donatest cricket
 94 kaa ausat, first class cricket main 95
 An average of 15 has become a measure of success for every person playing cricket
 aapako bataa den kibreadman sachin tendulkar se bahut prabhavit the, unka kahana tha ki sachin ko dekhakar unhen apane khilne ke din yaad aate hai
 Don was better than Sachin, where the cricketer from all over the world wants to become Sachin Tendulkar, but if he asks Sachin, maybe he wants to become a don, he is such a charmer
 agar sachin cricket ke bhagwaan hai to ye hai bhagwaan se just dabl
 There is hardly anyone who knows cricket from his aura

 basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne shanivaar ko bhim army jaise sanghathanon par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki ye bijepi ke ishaaron par khel rahe hai
 He said that the BSP has come to know that organizations like Bhim Army, Bahujan Youth for Mission 2019 - the next Prime Minister Bahn Ji are being run from behind the scenes by our opposition
 mayawati ne kaha ki jo log bhi basapa virdohi sanghathanon ko chalaa rahe hai vah dalit coloniyon main rahane vaale hamaare bhole-bhaale logon ko bataa rahe hai ki vah bahanji ko pradhanmantri banaaenge
 Let us know that Jai Prakash, who was expelled from BSP, is currently touring in UP with a chariot under Bahujan Youth for Mission 2019 to make Mayawati the PM
 mayawati ne kaha, 'bhim army jaise sanghathan bhole bhaale logon ko bahaka rahe hai
 These organizations have stalled the growing movement of the BSP
 basapa sabhi dharmo or jatiyon kii party he
 At the same time organizations like Bhim Army are made for personal selfishness
 is tarah ke sanghathan chalaane vaale log logon se apana vyavsaay chalaane or apane kaaryakramon main logon ko ikattha karne ke liye kah rahe he
 Not only this, these organizations are telling people that they are only working to strengthen the BSP and Behenji
 vah logon kii bhaawanaaon se khel rahe hai or unase fund ikattha karke unka vyaktigat istemaal kar rahe hai
 Mayawati said that such organizations not only do this to fulfill the selfish needs of themselves and the opposition but they also incite our innocent people against the upper caste and spread hatred
 ayodhya ke mudde par bijepi sarkaar ko nishane par lete hue mayawati ne kaha, 'centre main bijepi sarkaar ko paanch saal puure hone vaale hai

 april kii 25 taarikh ko jodhpur jail main nyaayadhish madhusudan sharma ne swayambhu baba asaram ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai to uskaa cheharaa utar gaya
 Once upon a time, all the trio of Asaram, who used to play magic on thousands of devotees, went in front of the court
 nyaayadhish ne agast 2013 main ek naaballig ladki ke saath balaatkaar ke aarope main asaram ko sajaa sunaate hue kadi tippanee kii, "doshi ne na keval peedita kaa bharosa todaa balki aam janata main santon kii chhavi ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaaya
 "but it was not so easy to fight a master of such power as Asaram
 khud nyaayadhish ne peedita ke hausale kaa bhi zikr kiya
 The victim was terrified of Asaram's immense stature and strength, but she showed courage by getting the support of the parents and leading her to this end
 isi ke saath gunahon ke liye surkhiyaan batorne vaale is badakaar baba kii kalank katha kaa patakshep ho gaya
 Asaram Bapu's rise, flourish and then fall are among the most amazing stories of recent decades
 asaram kaa utthan or patansindh praant main navabashah ilaake ke biraani gaanv kaa ek sharnaarthi ladkaa vibhaajan ke baad pehle kuccha or phir vahaan se ahmedabad pahunchaa
 In the beginning, he did many things from repairing a bicycle shop to a tangwale, and eventually chose his path to become a storyteller and made tremendous followers, and then one day came down to the ground
 yah kisi avishsaneey kahani kii tarah he
 The boy was none other than Asumal Thaumal Harpalani, who later took his name Asaram
 kuccha se aane ke baad asaram ahmedabad ke jis maninagar ilaake main rahaa, usee ilaake ke rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke bade netaa (jinka nidhan ho chukaa he) ne ek baar india today ko bataaya tha ki asaram ne apni javaani ke dinon main unke saath aresas kii shakhaon main shariq hone kii bhi koshish kii thi, par uske aatmakendrit taur-tareekon kii vajah se use jaldi hi baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 According to a friend of his who knew Asaram from the days of Kutch, he had also tried to become a follower of Leela Shah Baba, the elder Sindhi saint of Kutch at a young age, but the saint had never seen him in his stubborn and capricious complexion
 did not accept
 magar yah sachai kabhi saarvajanik taur par saamne nahin ai ki lilashah baba ne asumal ko thukraa diya tha
 Soon Asumal took his new name Asaram Bapu and took the saint's white dress and went on the path of becoming a saint
 uske aasapaas log jutane lage jinamein shuruyaat main zyaadaatar sindhi the
 Soon, when he claimed to relieve the sufferings of people suffering from depression of the lower classes in the name of Lord Krishna and Lord Shiva and his Guru Pooja, all sorts of people started joining the community of his followers
 vah apane paas aane vaale logon ko prabhavit karne ke liye kai tikadamen apanaataa tha
 Asaram's followers were known for one thing - violence
 gujarat, rajasthan or madhya pradesh ke kai ilaakon main, jahaan uske anuyaayi badi taadaad main the, log safed chola dhaaran kiye asaram ke saadhakon ke saath relon-bason main safar karne se darane lage the ki kahin kisi choti-si baat par bhi unki naaraazgi mol na le len
 Some of Asaram's nearly 400 ashrams spread across the country were coerced or blackmailed by his seekers from their real owners
 uske khilaaf ho chuke ek purv anuyaayi ne india today ko borevar bataaya tha ki kis tarah haridwar ke najadik rishikesh ke ashram kii jameen ek sadhu se hinsa ke bal par chhini gai thi
 The reality is that the land of many of his ashrams is mired in court cases because their real owners are now trying to get their land back
 haalanki kai log apni jaaydaad se haath dho baithe hai
 In the 1980s, the former royal family of Panchdeed near Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh rented a prized piece of land for spiritual activities to the followers of Asaram
 kuch vakt baad unhone paaya ki us jameen par ashram bana liya gaya, jisase asaram ke saadhakon ko bedakhal karnaa unke bas kii baat nahin rah gai
 According to Om Singh Chauhan, the current Thakur of Panchred, the documents were manipulated with the connivance of revenue officials and ultimately the family was forced to leave the land and sell it to a trust of Asaram at a paltry price
 saadhakon ko hinsa kii talim khud asaram ke upadeshon or pravachanon se milti thi
 For example, in the controversial sermon of one of his books, he exhorted his followers to never question the Guru, whether right or wrong
 2008 main india today main is bare main rapat chhapane ke baad kitaab kii us saamagree ko waapas le liya gaya
 In this, Asaram compared the guru to Shiva and threatened that if a follower ever tried to stab the guru in the back or pay obedience to his decree, he would have to bear a severe curse
 isse bhi aage badhkar usne anuyaayiyon se na keval hinsak hone balki is had tak hinsak hone ke liye kaha tha ki apane virodhiyon kii jabaan kaat lo
 In one of his speeches, he also told the seekers that rebelling against the Guru is as much a sin as having sex with the Guru's wife
 phir 9 / 11 ke baad usne khuleam osama bin laden kii is baat ke liye tarif kii thi ki usne aise anuyaayi paidaa kiye jo apane guru kii khatir kuch bhi kar guzarane ke liye taiyaar the
 Another important point was that Asaram's Guru Dakshina program on Guru Purnima every year became a winch for him to spew money
 is din lakhon log aate or pracheen bhartiya parampara kaa nirvaah karte hue rakam kii shakl main dakshina bhent karte
 He also used to extort money from people in many other ways
 aadhyatmikta or jan seva par uski patrikaayen—rishi prasad or lok kalyaan sethu—uske sabase achche dinon main har saal 7
 5 crores Rs
 jutati thim
 Sales of about two dozen products also amounted to crores
 aate the, jinamein kai kism kii ayurvedic davaaiyaan, gomutra, sabun, shampoo or agarbattiyaan vagairah shaamil thim
 The empire was controlled by around 400 trusts, of which the two heads were the Shri Asaram Ashram Trust and the Sant Shri Asaramji Mahila Utthan Trust
 donon ke mukhyalay ahmedabad main the
 The celebrations of Asaram's Holi and Krishna Janmashtami were occasions for him to mingle with women
 inamen vah bhagwaan krishna kii tarah bana dhaaran karke unheen kii tarah adaakaari or nrity karata tha
 He even wore a crown and used to showered colors with squatters on female followers
 aresas se apni najdiki dikhaakar or hindutv ke muddon kii himaayat karke usne gujarat kii hindutv kii duniya main badi saavdhaanee se apana rob-daab jamaaya tha

 Controversy, however, followed Asaram from time to time, but Asaram saw very good days from 1980 to 2008 until his downfall
 uskaa patan tab shuru hua jab ahmedabad main uske ashram ke skool ke do chaatro kii laash sabarmati nadi ke tal se baraamad hui or aarope lage ki asaram tantric he jisane tantric anushthan ke liye sharir ke ang nikaalane ke makasad se in do chaatro ko maravaaya he
 The allegations were not proved but Asaram's downfall must have started
 us vakt kii narendra modi sarkaar ne aaropon kii jaanch ke liye ek ayog gathit kiya, jisane apane saamne gavaahi dene ke liye logon ko aamantrit kiya
 Asaram's angry followers began to appear one by one and his empire — the land of his trusts so far — stood at Rs 25,000 crore
 kaa ho chukaa tha—ke kai kaale rahasy ujagar karne lage
 These included her alleged sexual life, especially her attachment to girls
 ye aarope ab khuleam or media ke saamne bhi lagaae jane lage or isaki aguai asaram ke kuch sabase pramukh anuyaayi kar rahe the jo ab uske dushman ban chuke the
 These included three key witnesses to the alleged illegal activities of Mahendra Chawla and Asaram, who had somehow escaped the murderous attacks — Amrit Prajapati, who was silenced by at least six violent thunderbolts Shot in Rajkot in 2014 after the attacks; Akhil Gupta, who was Asaram's cook and was shot dead in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh in 2015; And Rahul Sachan, who disappeared from Lucknow in November 2015 despite police protection
 sachaan ke gaayab hone ke takreeban ek pakhwaade baad uttar pradesh police ne isaki report darj kii
 It tells of the influence of Asaram's followers, even when he was weakened and jailed (he has been in jail since 2013 on charges of rape)
 ahm baat yah he ki virodhiyon par uske anuyaayiyon ke hamalon kii fehrist gairmamuli dhang se lambii he
 Interestingly, Prajapati, who was once Vaidya of Asaram, told that his "guru" had asked him to make Ayurvedic medicines to enhance his sex power
 unhone yah bhi bataaya tha ki jab jawan mahila shraddhaluon ko uske ahmedabad ashram kii ek ekant imaarat main "guru'' darshan ke liye le jaaya jaataa tha, tab unhen nashe kaa ek seerup yaa ghol diya jaataa tha, jise "panched jadi-booti'' kaha jaataa tha, kyonki yah panched ke ashram se aayaa tha
 According to some followers, this herb was nothing but opium solution
 aise dhaha kaala samrajgast 2013 main uttar pradesh kii rahane vaali ek kishori dilli ke police adhikariyon ke paas gai or bataaya ki asaram ne kis prakaar jodhpur ke apane ashram main uskaa shaareerik shoshan kiya
 Delhi Police registered a zero FIR on 20 August and then sent it to the Jodhpur police station
 supreme court ke aadeshaanusaar desh ke kisi bhi hisse main exiar darj karai ja sakati he, aisi shikaayat ko jiro exiar kaha jaataa he
 Seeing the ball in its court, the Congress government of Rajasthan was seen to be moving very early
 varisht police adhikariyon ne kah diya ki ladki ke saath balaatkaar to kya balaatkaar kii koshish bhi nahin maani ja sakati kyonki asaram ne keval us ladki ke sharir ke upree nagn hisson ko chuaa tha or use apane jananaang chune ko vivash kiya tha
 At that time very few people were aware of the power of Poxo law
 poxo kanoon main yah saaf taur par likhaa gaya he ki agar peedit alpaayu he to uske saath hui kaamukthapurna chhedchhad ko bhi usee balaatkaar kii shrenee main hi rakhaa jayega jisamen yon ang kaa pravesh shaamil hota he
 That is why Asaram is sentenced to life imprisonment
 congress sarkaar shuru-shuru main asaram ke khilaaf karrwai se hichakati najar aati thi kyonki teen maheene baad vidhansabha chunaav hone the
 The action on Asaram was expected to shift the Congress to Hindu votes as the BJP was already looking to gain from the Hindutva wave of the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi
 ek police adhikari jisane muthbhed ke aaropon main jail kii salaakhon ke peeche lanbaa samay kaata he, use bhi farji baba kaa kareebi bataaya gaya
 It was feared that this case would be made so strong that Asaram would eventually be punished
 lekin maamle kii lipapoti ke koi aadesh nahin the
 The officials were clearly aware that they would have to take every step very carefully while following the entire process during the action, only then would they be able to lay hands on Asaram
 isi nazariye ke kaaran use sajaa ho saki he
 Of course, the most important was the resolve of the victim and his family
 ve taqatvar or khatarnaak charitra vaale asaram ko uske is dhokhe ke liye sajaa dilaane ko har khatra molne ko taiyaar the
 Actually, the parents sent their daughter to Asaram to get a good education
 us ladki ko asaram kii seva ke liye niyukt kiya gaya par vah usase apni vaasana kii purti karana chahta tha
 The court considered that the crime was done in a planned manner and hence life imprisonment would be an appropriate punishment
 jaanch kii aguai kar rahe ajaypal lamba ne sajaa hone ke turant baad is faisle ko mile kaa pathar bataate hue fasebuk par likhaa, "yah faisla aparadhik nyaayashastra main ek mile ke pathar kii tarah yaad kiya jayega
 If the law is followed in a fair manner, even the weakest person can get justice by challenging the most influential criminals like Asaram
 '' lamba us dauraan disipi the or jodhpur ke police kamisionar biju joseph ko report karte the
 Lamba himself is an IPS officer and started working with the thought that something was wrong with the victim
 usne jo bataaya he vah satya he lekin use record par laane or bhaleebhanti satyapit karne kii jarurat he
 He entrusted the responsibility of the state police officer Chanchal Mishra to arrest Asaram as he refused to cooperate in the interrogation and went to his Indore ashram
 mishra ne asaram ko shantipurvak aatmasamarpan ke liye taiyaar karne ke liye saare tareeke apanaae or safal bhi hue
 As soon as the BJP government came to power in Rajasthan in December 2013, most of the officers involved in the investigation of this case were transferred
 nai team pehle se zyada satark thi
 It is for this reason that the initial investigation and the evidence that came on record made it possible for justice to be delayed too late
 mjedaar baat yah he ki asaram ke anuyaayi shuru se hi congress kii tatkaaleen adhyaksh sonia gandhi par use shransaaney kaa aarope lagaate rahe hai
 Sanjiv Sharma, a lawyer for the High Court in Jodhpur, also believes that Asaram has been sentenced for speaking against Sonia Gandhi and her family
 thik aise hi aarope uma bharti ne 2013 main lagaaya thah "unhen sonia or rahul gandhi kaa virodh karne ke kaaran nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 During the trial of this case, 13 eyewitnesses were attacked and three of them also lost their lives
 ek kii to jodhpur kii adaalat main chura ghonpakar hatya kar di gai thi
 But there is no direct connection to these cases with any direct connection with Asaram
 lekin jis tarah se vibhinn rajyon main gavaahon ko dhamkaane ke baad hamale hue yaa unki hatya hoti raheen, usase police kii apane gavaahon ko surakshit rakhane main naakaami bhi dikhti he
 Frequent musings in Asaram's court were also stirring
 uske saikadon samarthak uski ek jhalak paane ke liye ghanton uskaa intjaar karte the or kuch to paidal hi court se lekar jail tak uske peeche-peeche bhaagate the
 They also used to be aggressive at that time
 police ne maamle kii sunwaayee jail main hi karaane kii ek aadhi-adhuri koshish bhi kii thi par court ne manaa kar diya
 Nevertheless, the court accepted the appeal of the police that there is a danger of deteriorating law and order in bringing Asaram from jail to court for punishment, so that the court should be sentenced in jail
 asaram ko child trephiking or poxo act ke tahat sajaa hui he or uske vakeelon ne puri koshish kii thi ki peedita ko balig sabit kiya jaae
 If he could have proved a minor, Asaram would not have been punished under the poxo and he would have escaped such a severe punishment
 lekin adaalat main uske vakil yah sabit nahin kar sake
 Sajjanraj Surana, Asaram's lawyer, says, "the court did not include an insurance policy in the judgment, which questions the verdict
" '' haalanki jodhpur baar association ke adhyaksh ranjit joshi kaa kahana he, "faisla gavaah or sabooton ke aadhaar par hua he
 "asaram spokesperson Neelam Dubey has now said to appeal in the High Court
 sawaal he ki kya use upree adaalat se jamaanat milegi? darasal, asaram ke khilaaf vibhinn dhaaraon ke tahat aarope lage the or adaalat ne maamle kii vistrut sunwaayee ke baad apane faisle main use sajaa sunai
 He has been sentenced to strict punishment
 upree adaalatein hi yah tay karengi ki kya nirantar sajaa uchit he yaa phir samavarti (kancerent) sajaa hi paryaapt he
 Well, whatever, there is little hope that he will be able to come out of jail in any lifetime during his lifetime
 phir bhi badi adaalaton ne samay-samay par bade aparaadhon main bhi aropiyon ko badi raahat di he
 Take the case of Salman Khan
 yah bhi jodhpur ke nikat hua tha or aane vaale kai varshon tak yah chalata rahegaa
 Asaram hopes that he will one day be released from jail and will be able to live his life like a king
 anya peediton ko bhi asasaram ke mukademon main jin logon ko uske raaj kholane se rokane or khamosh karne kii garaj se maut kii neend sula diya gaya, ab unke parijan insaaf kii maang kar rahe hai
 Investigations in many of these cases have progressed somewhat, but in a single case she has not reached Asaram's throat
 haalanki uske vafaadaar kehete hai ki in hamalon or hatya main asaram kii koi bhoomika nahin thi, magar peediton ke rishtedaaron kaa kahana he ki asaram kii mileebhagat ke saboot hai jo apane aap sari kahani bayaan kar dete hai
 Naresh Gupta, the father of slain Akhil Gupta, says, "one of the two alleged assailants arrested in the murder of my son has actually told the police that the plot to kill him was hatched by two dozen followers of Asaram at the ashram in Ghaziabad
" tamaam sandigdhon ke phone kol record kii jaanch kii jaae or unase kadai se poochtacha kii jaae to sari kahani saamne aa jaaegi
 We have strong information that these people used to get these messages from Asaram itself, either through middlemen or Asaram himself used to send these messages directly from Jodhpur jail through illegal phone calls
 kol record kii jaanch or jodhpur jail ke jailer se poochtacha ke alaava un logon kii jaanch-padtaal honi chahie jo hatya kii avadhi ke dauraan asaram se milane aae the
 This can reveal the truth
 ''magar asaram or uske anuyaayiyon ke khilaaf in shikayaton main ek fark dekha ja saktaa he
 After this tough decision of the court against Asaram, there is hope and confidence among these people that the loop of law can be tightened in the neck of Asaram
 philhal asaram urf kaidi number 130 ab apane jivan ke aakhri din usee rajasthan kii jail main bitaayega jahaan se uskaa sant ke rup main udai hua tha
 Clearly, this stigma of Asaram is a surprising story of havoc reaching the floor by breaking the narrative and the power of money

 Even whether Siddartha Anand will be the director of this sequel or not, it is not decided
 ection se bharpoor film 'baing baing' kaa box offis pradarshan kaaphi ausat rahaa tha
 Although Fox Star Studios, which released the film, claims a turnover of 178 crores, it cost 140 crores to promote the film adorned with big stars like Hrithik and Katrina

 After giving their share to multiplex owners, the studio only got 90 crores

 pitru ke tarpan ke liye prasiddh 'muktidhaam' mandir gaya main sthit he or yah vahi jagah he jahaan par mata sita ne bhagwaan shriram ke pita or apane sasur raja dasharath kaa pindadaan kiya tha
 People arrive from all over the country
 Gaya of Yhambihar is known as Muktidham in the world and it is believed that by offering pinddaan in Gaya, the soul of the fathers is liberated

 On the demand of King Dasharatha, Mata Sita sits on the banks of the river Falgu and considers the ketaki flowers and the cow there as a witness and makes pinddan for them
 kuch samay baad jab bhagwaan ram or lakshmana saamagree lekar lautate hai, tab sita unhen bataati he ki ve maharaj dasharath kaa pindadaan kar chuki hai
 On this, Shriram asks him to give proof of this without refusing to accept the material

 After this, Sitaji meditated on the soul of Maharaj Dasaratha and prayed to witness with him
 unke aagrah par swayan maharaj dasharath kii aatma prakat hui or unhone kaha ki sita ne unka pindadaan kar diya he
 Lord Ram became convinced after getting the testimony of his father

 If the Karni army continues to suffer after this, then as a Rajput, they too will teach a lesson to the members of the Karni army

 na to kisi parivaar or na hi koi samudaay ne is film ko lekar koi aapatti jataai he

 — Vasundhara Raje (@vasundharabjp)july 2, 2015 The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Monday released the revised guidelines for recognition of journalists
 isamen 'phek news' se nipatane ke liye kai nae praavdhaanon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 It also includes stringent provisions like abolition of accreditation of journalists
 isko lekar media jagat main virodh ke sur bhi shuru ho gaye hai
 What is a statement issued by the government's guideline ministry, it gives a brief idea about how a complaint about a fake news will be investigated and by whom
 bayaan ke mutabik, 'ab phek news ke bare main kisi tarah kii shikaayat milane par yadi vah print media kaa hua to use press concil of india (PCI) or electronic media kaa hua to news broadcasters association (NBA) ko bheja jayega
 These organizations will decide whether the news is fake or not
 'yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki aisi shikaayat milane par kisi patrkaar ko zyada pareshaani na ho, shikaayat kii prakriya ko donon agenciyon ke dwaara 15 din ke bheetar nipataane kii vyavastha hogi
 In a response to the tweet, Information and Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani herself said, 'it would be fair to say that the cases of fake news will be decided by PCI and NBA, both agencies are not regulated or operated by the Government of India Huh
 'virodh kii taiyaarihalanki sarkaar ke is kadam kaa virodh bhi shuru ho gaya he
 Many journalists are preparing to hold a meeting to discuss it and protest
 kuch patrakaron kaa kahana he ki yah 'media kaa galaa ghontne kii koshish ke tahat laayaa ja rahaa sarkaar kaa aloktantric kadam he
 'however, Smriti Irani has tried to make it clear that' the government will not regulate or operate the investigation of Fake News and the ethical conduct rules set for it will be the same as those of journalistic institutions like NBA and PCI
 'varisht patrkaar shekhar gupta sarkaar ke is kadam kaa virodh karte hue twit karte hai, 'aisi galati na karen
 This is an extraordinary attack on the mainstream media
 yah vaisaa hi he jaisaa rajeev gandhi kaa anti defmeshan bill tha
 The entire media should forget their differences and oppose it
 'make no mistake: this is a breathtaking assault on mainstream media
 It's a moment like Rajiv Gandhi's anti-defamation bill

 Till such time the regulation is not implemented rules cannot be enforced for news portals by industry
 Smriti z Irani (@smritiirani) April 2, 2018 While clarifying this, Smriti Irani said, 'the committee will have senior officials, representatives of PCI, NBA and IBF
 jab tak koi regulation nahin aa jaataa,news portelske liye niyam lagu nahin kiye ja sakate
 'whatever it is, it is certain that the government and the media are once again on the cusp of confrontation with the new move on fake news

 Recognition of such journalists will be suspended for a year on the second mistake and permanently on the third mistake

 UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi's political advisor and Congress leader Ahmed Patel tweeted, "I appreciate Ankush's effort on Fake News, but many questions are arising in my mind

 What is the guarantee that this rule will not be used to harass honest journalists? 2

 Is it not possible that a complaint will be made against someone deliberately, so that his or her recognition is suspended till the investigation continues? 4

 Azam Khan, who won the election from the same seat eight times, challenged the royal imam to contest the election

 vijender singh, 26 varshaboxing, 75 kilo, middlawet,bhivani, haryanaunaki kahani bhartiya boxing ke jabardast naam vijendra singh ne jab 2008 main beijing olympic main bronj medal jeeta tha, to unhone puure desh main josh kii lahar paidaa kar di thi
 He disappointed many by losing at the AIIBA World Boxing Championships in Azerbaijan in 2011, jeopardizing his chances of an early entry to the London Olympics
 vijender ne aakhirkaar 2012 ke asian olympic qualifyres ke semifinal main pahunch kar olympic ke liye qualiphi kar liya, unhen ummid rahi hogi ki is jeet se unke aalochakon kaa munh band ho jayega
 But the final verdict will be pronounced only after London
 vijender ke liye dabaav koi nai baat nahin he
 He failed to qualify for the Beijing Olympics in the first two attempts, but then returned with the country's first Olympic boxing medal from this event held once in four years
 is baar bhi unhen ummid he ki ve sahi samay par apane charam par aa jaaenge or medal kii raah takate desh ko ek gold medal jitkar denge
 It is special that in 2009 he became the world champion in the middleweight category
 is uplabdhi par unhen rajeev gandhi khel ratna award or padmashri se sammanit kiya gaya
 His last notable victory is the gold medal won at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China
 chunautiyaan kamyaabi milane par prashikshan main kotahi baratane or glamer kii duniya main mouj karne ke liye unki akasar aalochana kii jaati rahi he
 Vijender won the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games
 ja medal se santusht hokar or 2011 main lachar form jari rakhkar or zyada sandehon ke liye gunjaaish chhod di
 Whether the mission Olympics is a matter of misfortune or pure complacency, Vijender is far from his peak
 landan ke liye khud ko form main laane ke liye unhone ek nijee physiotherapist or ek prashikshak niyukt kiya he
 Their hopes of winning the medal are based on the fact that they will be able to prove themselves more than their rivals due to their experience

 Just before Ranbheri of Mahamukabala, Mamata Banarjee in West Bengal's capital Kolkata has not only demonstrated her power by bringing all the opposition parties together on one platform, but has also shown a glimpse of opposition unity
 magar mamata banerjee kii is raily se congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or upie kii cheirpersansonia gandhi kaa alag rahanaa, apane aap main kaisawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 Whether the opposition's Grand Alliance exercise against the Modi government at the national level will be a reality or it will remain as a trap, it will tell the time, but in many states, the way the regional parties are looking to distance themselves from the Congress, it is now a There is a discussion once again whether the opposition is really united? Such questions are also blazing in the mind because the leaders of about 20 political parties were seen on Mamta's platform, some of whom have an alliance with Congress and some who have declared to fight in the Lok Sabha elections without Congress
 kolkata main vipakshi netaaon ke jamaavade se yah spasht hota he ki bhale hi unke bich gathbandhan na ho, magar vah logon ko yah dikhaane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki vah modi sarkaar ke khilaaf ek hai
 In fact, on Saturday, 20 leaders of about 20 to 22 parties came together on the stage at the 'united India rally' called by Mamta Banerjee
 ye netaa ek manch par ek saath to jarur aa gaye, magar inamen se kai aise hai jo pehle hi loksabhaa chunaav main congress se alag jane kaa faisla le chuke hai
 Even if the leaders of the opposition parties are seen together on one platform, then the question arises that will they also get together in the electoral arena to defeat the BJP? The answer is probably neither
 kayonki haal hi main uttar pradesh main mayawati or akhilesh yadav ne sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan kaa elaan kar is baat kii tasdik kar di ki upi main congress akeli ho gai he
 That is, in UP, the Congress now has to fight the BJP, as well as the BSP and SP
 is tarah se vipakshi partiyon ke paas vijan spasht he ki centre kii satta se modi sarkaar ko haraana he, magar kaise hataanaa he yah tarika nahin pataa he
 In UP, the BSP-SP has announced to fight together in 80 Lok Sabha seats
 is gathbandhan main congress ko jagah nahin mili he
 That is, here Congress has to fight alone against BJP and SP-BSP alliance
 magar hairaani kii baat yah he ki mamata kii raily main ye teenon vipakshi ekta ke gavaah bane
 Now the question arises that if these parties are showing the power of being together on the stage, then why are they shying away from going to the elections? kolkata main mamata banerjee ke manch par congress ke netaa or aam aadmi party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal bhi the
 Both Congress and Aam Aadmi Party were members of the opposition solidarity rally against the Modi government, but in Delhi with 7 Lok Sabha seats, these parties will contest separately
 pehle dilli main aam aadmi party or congress main gathbandhan kii sambhaavna thi, magar shila dikshit or gopal raay ke bayaan ke baad in sambhaavnaaon par pani phir gaya he
 Meaning that in Delhi, the Congress will not only fight the BJP, it will also contest the election with the Aam Aadmi Party
 mamata banerjee ne bhale hi loksabhaa chunaav se pehle vipakshi ekta kaa netritv shanivaar ko kolkata main kiya
 But even though he is with the Congress on the stage, he is not with the Congress in the electoral fray
 mamata banerjee pehle hi elaan kar chuki hai ki vah loksabhaa chunaav main akeli chunaav ladengi
 That is, TMC will not have an alliance with Congress
 isliye yahaan bhi congress bijepi ke saath-saath tiemasi se bhi ladegi
 In Telangana, the Chief of TRS and Chief Minister k Chandrasekhar Rao are talking about the Federal Front
 fedral front kii kavayad main jute kesiar iske liye kejariwal, mamata banerjee, akhilesh aadi se bhi mil chuke hai
 He neither wants to come with Congress nor with BJP
 is tarah se 17 loksabhaa siton vaale telugana main bhi congress akeli hi he
 It faces a challenge to fight both BJP and TRS
 andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ne shanivaar ko mamata ke manch se kaha ki samvidhan bachaane-desh bachaane ke liye centre se modi sarkaar ko hataanaa hoga
 For this, he is seen doing the exercise of the grand alliance, but so far he has not been able to implement it
 chandrababu naidu ne ab tak loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke saath jaaenge yaa nahin, iskaa elaan nahin kiya he
 It is different that he was with the Congress in the Telangana assembly elections
 bataa den ki yahaan 25 loksabhaa siten hai
 The state of the grand alliance in Bihar with 40 Lok Sabha seats is better than other states
 mamata ke manch par rajd netaa tejasvi yadav bhi dikhe
 The news of relief for the Congress is visible only from Bihar
 kyonki vahaan rajd ke saath congress mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa he
 But there are reports of wrangling over seats
 lekin yah clear he ki congress bihar main mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa hogi
 In Odisha with 21 Lok Sabha seats, the Congress is completely alone
 vahaan congress ke saamne bhi do badi partia hai, jinase paar paanaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Odisha Chief Minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik has clearly stated that he will neither go with Congress nor with BJP
 vahiin, jammu-kashmir main congress neshnal conference ke saath he
 There the Congress will definitely get some relief from the separation of PDP and BJP
 magar raah itani bhi aasaan nahin
 Mayawati's BSP alliance with Ajit Jogi in the Chhattisgarh Assembly elections, if the Lok Sabha elections are in place, the Congress will also face difficulties here
 is tarah se dekha jaae to loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bhale hi rashtriya str par modi sarkaar ke khilaaf vipakshi ekta ke gubaare phulae ja rahe hai, magar yah kitne der main foot jayega, is par ab bhi sanshay ke badal barkaraar hai
 The Congress is the oldest party in the country at the center of the grand alliance, but in the pictures that are being shown right now, it is seen isolated in many places

 com / iretxffvvk— Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi)july 16, 2018 As such, when and where the meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Union of India Region takes place, very few people know
 lekin ye baithak shanivaar ko patna main chal rahi he, iskaa pataa sabko us samay chal gaya jab rashtriya janata dal ke netaa is baithak kaa bahishkaar kar chal die
 His protest was that Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi said in his address that currently four former Chief Ministers of the country are in jail
 patna ke baapu sabhaagaar main chal rahi is baithak main hangaame ko khud loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ko shant karana padaa or unhone yah bhi kaha ki ye koi bihar vidhansabha nahin he
 But it did not affect the RJD mlas and leaders and they went on a walkout
 baad main rajd netaaon ne kaha ki modi ko aisi tippanee se bachanaa chahie tha or unhone jaan boojhkar yah bolkar sabko uttejit karne kii koshish kii
 The comments vipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav is kaarykram se dur rahe or unhone twit kar kaha ki, 'rashtramandal sansadeey sangh sammelan, patna main daagiyon ke sargana susheel modi ne 52 deshon ke pratinidhiyon ke saamne bihar ko kalankit karne kaa ghrunit krity kiya he
 Bihar's biggest Four Twenty BJP leader Sushil Modi has himself been accused in many cases
 ye sabase bade ghotalebaz hai
 He further wrote, "why did not the little-known Sushil Modi tell at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference that the Chief Minister of Bihar has a case of serious murder? Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is accused of stealing the thesis of a JNU student
 bihar kii mantriparishad main 75 fisadi mantri daagi hai
 'tejaswi further writes,' Why did Sushil Modi not tell that there were 40 record-breaking scams in Bihar under Nitish's leadership? Why not tell that his sister and he swallowed crores of creation scam
 apana kaala bhrashtachar chhipaane ke liye susheel modi ne is manch kaa prayog kiya
 The thief of thieves is showing honesty
 ' ek anya twit main tejasvi ne likhaa, 'susheel modi ko sansadeey pranali taar-taar karne ke liye maafi maangani chahie
 Nitish Kumar ji, who became Chief Minister, Mauni Baba, should also open his mouth on the incident that what is the compulsion that he has made such irrational abusive person as Deputy Chief Minister? vahiin susheel modi ne kaha ki rajd ke netaaon ne jaisaa vyavhaar kiya he usase lagata hai ki chor kii dadhi main tinkaa
 Sushil Modi alleged that the flare up of RJD leaders reflects the adage of 'a straw in a beard's thief'
 susheel ne shuukravaar ko aae ucchtam nyaayalay ke ek faisle kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki bhrashtachar par ankush lagane ke liye pichley anek varshon ke dauraan centre or rajya sarkaron ne anek kadam uthaae hai
 This will further increase the credibility of the legislature
 up mukhyamantri ke aage yah kahe jane par ki is samay desh ke chaar purv mukhyamantri bhrashtachar ke aarope main kisi na kisi jail main band hai, sabhaagaar main maujuud rajd vidhayakon ne apni siton se khadey hokar is par aapatti jataate hue hangaamaa shuru kar diya or virodhswaroop narebaaji karte hue sabhaagaar se nikal gaye
 It is noteworthy that former Bihar Chief Minister and RJD chief Lalu Prasad is currently in jail in a case related to crores of fodder scam

 mangalvaar ko soochna ayukta shridhar aacharulu ritair ho gaye
 Who has replaced him has not been decided
 maheene ke ant tak kul chaar soochna ayukta ritair ho rahe hai
 In a special conversation with NDTV, Sridhar Acharyulu said, "vacancy is a serious thing in the Central Information Commission
 in vaikency kii vajah se artii aavednon kii pendency bad jaaegi or aam logon ko infarmeshan justise samay par nahin milegaa
 '' unhone kaha ki agar ek soochna ayukta ek din main 20 keson kii sunwaayee nahin karata he to siaisi 2250 keson kii sunwaayee ek din main kar saktaa he jo vaikensiyon kii vajah se sambhav nahin ho rahi hai
 The Central Information Commission should have 11 Information Commissioners, including the Chief Information Commissioner, but only three will remain thereafter
 lekin sarkaar ne samay rahete inke vikalp nahin khoje
 Sridhar Acharyulu says, “the government must fill these vacancies as quickly as possible
 sabko pataa he ki siaisi main koun koun kab ritair ho rahaa he
 '' activist anjali bharadwaj ne isi maheene 12 november ko RTI ke zarie sarkaar se jaankaree maangi to sarkaar ne jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 Anjali Bhardwaj asked through RTI that in July 2018 applications were sought for the appointment of Information Commissioners in the Central Information Commission, the government should give the names of those who applied and also give information about how many people applied? The government refused to answer
 tippaniyan Earlier, Anjali Bhardwaj had filed a PIL in the Supreme Court on the issue of vacancy in the Central Information Commission
 or ab jaldi hi is bare main court se jaldi sunwaayee kii guzarish karne vaali hai
 In fact, these vacancies will directly affect the cases pending in the Central Information Commission

 In the report, questions have been raised not only on the Central Information Commission but also on the vacant posts in the Information Commissions of 23 states across the country

 aandh pradesh, bihar, jharkhand, madhyapradesh, rajasthan or tamilnadu ne lambit pade maamalon par koi jaankaree nahin di
 He said that if an information commissioner does not hear 20 cases in a day, CIC can hear 2250 cases in a day which are not possible due to vacancies
 kendriya soochna ayog main mukhya soochna ayukta samet 11 soochna ayukta hone chahie lekin iske baad bas teen rah jaaenge
 But the government did not find alternatives for them in time
 shridhar aacharulu kehete hai, "sarkaar ko jaldi se jaldi in vaikensiyon ko bharna hoga
 Everyone knows who is retiring in CIC
 '' Activist Anjali Bhardwaj sought information from the government through RTI on 12 November this month, when the government refused to answer
