 darasal, ek dating site dwaara karaae gaye survey main yah baat saamne ai he
 People in the survey say that if their partner smells bad and does not even know the table manners, they feel very bad and they never want to meet him again
 janaab, agar aap chaahate hai ki aapke saath aisa naa ho to date par jane se pehle mint jarur kha len
 According to the Daily Mail, 65 to 75 per cent of the British people involved in the poll of this dating website believe that if you are going on a date with whom they smell bad and they behave in a fussy manner at the dining table, is
 ye do aisi baaten hai jinke chalate aksar rishte banane se pehle hi tut jate hai
 Not only this, every fourth woman (23 per cent) in the survey believes that if men on a date do not open their restaurant or hotel and ask them to go in first, then they understand that it is not the man they are looking for
 is
 puure britain bhar main 1000 logon par karaae gaye is survey main 58 fisadi maamalon main rishte paravaan nahin chadh paae kyonki date ke dauraan ek partner ko fishan kaa bilkul bhi sens nahin tha
 And when it comes to paying the bills, 41 percent of the men said that they do not get any pleasure from the fact that every time they are expected to give money from them
 jabaki har paanch main se ek mahila hameshaa ummid karti hai ki purush hi bill chukaayenge
 As far as clothing is concerned, 50 per cent of men said that if a woman came in a jumpsuit while on a date, it seems very bad, while 28 per cent of the men said that the woman with too much make-up could end the date passions
 She does it
 jahaan fishan sens ke maamle main purush mahilaon ko nahin bakhshate vahiin mahilaayein bhi unase kam nahin
 According to the survey, 41 percent of women say that if men come wearing shorts and T-shirts during the date, then they do not impress them at all
 isi tarah 18 fisadi mahilaon ne kaha ki date par jo purush bag taangkar aata he vah unhen jaraa bhi nahin bhaataa or ve unhen pehali hi mulaakaat ke baad tata-tata by-by kehane main hi bhalaai samajhati hai
 So now before going on a date, keep in mind all these things, so that you can be able to impress them at the first sight
 nahin to kahin aisa naa ho ki unke saath aapaki pehali date aakhri mulaakaat sabit ho
 Even if there is any doubt about Narendra Modi's growing national stature, it was overcome at the Sardar Patel Stadium in the heart of Ahmedabad on that bright morning
 jab modi ko 12 saal main chauthi baar gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke rup main shapath dilaai gai to is avasar par bijepi ke bhavi sahyogi dalon ke kai diggaj netaa upasthit the
 Although Modi's possible journey from the banks of the Sabarmati to the Yamuna shore may take some time, but speculation is afoot about who will be his successor in the event of his departure to Delhi? Will Modi and senior leader Nitinbhai Patel's Where will his strongest loyalist Anandiben Patel take oath in third place? In the previous government, he had two important departments: Revenue and Roads and Buildings Department
 kaddavar patel netaa or modi ke vafaadaar nitin bhai pichhali baar sinchai evam shahari vikaas mantri the
 The third candidate, bjp's national vice-president Purushottam Rupala, is also Patel and he was watching Modi's speech work in the recent assembly election campaign
 gauratlab he ki apni chhavi ke anuroop modi ne teen umradraj mantriyon, apane vafaadaar or purv vitt mantri vajubhai vaala, narottam patel tathaa mangubhai patel ko is baar mantrimandal main jagah nahin di
 Rather, he included young mlas like Ganpat Vasava, Nanu Vanani and Govind Patel, known for their honesty and considered a man of the Union
 jaisaa ki unhone do saal pehle party padaadhikariyon ko chunate samay kiya tha, modi apane 17 sadasyeey mantrimandal kii ausat aayu ko 65 se 55 varsh par le aae
 Saurabh Patel, who was last Minister of State for Industry, Power and Finance, was promoted to Cabinet Minister due to his superior performance, while a senior leader, Bhupendra Singh Chudasama, became the Rajput face of the Cabinet
 haalanki vajubhai vaala ko mantrimandal main shaamil na karne par kuch tyoriyaan jarur chadhin kyonki unhone 2001 main modi ke liye tab apni seat chodi thi, jab koi or vidhayak aisa karne ke liye taiyaar nahin tha
 But supporters of Vajubhai Vala, who knew Modi's future plans, took it positively
 soharabuddin maamle ke ek aaropee or modi ke pramukh ranneetikaar purv grih rajyamantri amit shah ko baahar rakhe jane ne bhi kuch atakalon ko janm diya, lekin shah ke khilaaf police maamle ko dekhte hue ise swaabhaavik maanakar kisi ne chuun-chapad nahin kii
 Modi has a definite plan for his new innings in Gujarat
 unka maananaa he ki nivesh or vinirmaan par paryaapt dhyaan diya ja chukaa he or ab kushal janashakti ke prashikshan, gyaan ko saajha karne tathaa krishi main aadhunik takneekon ke samavesh par dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 After the election results, Modi told India Today, "now one of our priority points will be skilled manpower training
 ’’ unki yojana jald hi ek krishi sammelan yojit karne kii he
 It will be interesting to know that for the promotion of drip and secular methods of irrigation, Modi's Gujarat Green Revolution Company, started in 2003, increased the land under minor irrigation from 15,000 hectares to 800,000 hectares in less than a decade
 is
 modi is rakabe ko or badhanaa chaahate hai
 However, in the elections, the BJP has won more than a dozen seats less than its expectation
 modi ko lagbhag apane sabhi aise raajnneetik pratidwandviyon ko dhul chataane kaa santosh hua hoga, jinhone pichley saal unke khilaaf lagaataar abhiyaan ched rakhaa tha
 They include Keshubhai Patel, whose Gujarat Parivartan Party failed in its plan to overthrow Modi
 lekin vahiin duusari ore kuch nitiyon ke chalate pradesh sarkaar ke karmchaariyon dwaara modi sarkaar ke virodh ke alaava ummidavaaron ke galat chayan or party kii andruni kalah ne bijepi ko lagbhag 15 siton kaa nuksaan bhi karaayaa
 BJP leader Kamabhai Rathore's selection as the party's candidate with a controversial image actually came as a party defeat to Sanand, while the seat symbolized the region and development of the famous Nano project
 isi tarah nikatavarti viramgaam main pragajibhai patel kii kharaab chhavi ke kaaran party ko paraajay kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Due to the anti-modi vote of the disgruntled government employees of the state, it is estimated that the BJP tasted defeat in eight seats
 in aath siton main godhra, luunawada, sojitra or saurashtra kii teen siten shaamil hai
 In this case, Modi suffered due to his unyielding attitude
 raajnneetik panditon kaa maananaa he ki bhale hi modi ne khud ko vikaas ke ek pratik ke rup main punarsthapit kar liya ho, lekin rashtriya str par matadaataaon se tadatmya banane ke liye agle chah maheenon main unhen ‘‘bina bhedbhaav ke vikaas’’ or ‘‘souno saath, souno vikaas (sabakaa samarthan, sabakaa vikaas)’’ jaise naaron ko bilkul nayaa mode dena hoga
 To make this possible, it will also be important for them to change their anti-muslim image
 haalia vidhansabha chunaavon main modi ne ek bhi musalmaan ummidavaar nahin utaara
 This put another weapon in the hands of his opponents in the form of the latest National Development Council data stating that Gujarat is one of the four states where urban Muslims are the poorest, along with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 lekin modi ko is tathy se raahat mil sakati he ki 22 aise nirvachan kshetron main takreeban 25-60 fisadi musalamaanon ne bijepi ko vot diya, jahaan kul matadaataaon main is samudaay ke 15 fisadi se adhik vot hai
 The question of how easy Modi's journey from Sabarmati to Yamuna will be remains on everyone's tongue till the answer is received in 2014

 ’ Accusing the UPA ally Trinamool Congress of 'political conspiracy' and 'attempts to fool Muslims', Union Minister Beni Prasad Verma demanded a ban on campaigning in Uttar Pradesh elections
 trinmul congress ne pichde muslimon ko kota ke tahat kota dene ke congress netaaon ke bayaan par aapatti jataai he
 Trinamool Congress leader Sultan Ahmed also rejected the Congress's argument that the model electoral code of conduct has no statutory status
 ahamed ne kaha, ‘jab duusari partiyon kaa maamla aata he to yah aachaar samhita hota he lekin sattarudh party ke liye iskaa koi myne nahin he
 It's amazing
 pehle salmaan khurshid ne kaha ki muslimon ko nau fisadi aarakshan diya janaa chahie jabaki sarkaar ke str par aisa koi nirnay nahin tha
 He said that now Beni Prasad is doing so
 unka maananaa he ki muslim kaaphi mahatvapurn hai
 it's not going to happen
 agar sarkaar muslimon ko aisa kuch dene par gambhir he to isaki ghoshnaa sarkaar ke str par honi chahie
 While addressing the election rally in the presence of Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh and Union Law Minister Salman Khurshid last night, Verma said, "reservation for Muslims will be increased and the Election Commission can issue notice to me if it wants
 ’ When asked if he demanded to ban Verma in Uttar Pradesh elections, he said, 'absolutely
 chunaav ayog aise netaaon ko pratibandhit kar saktaa he
 He (beni) should be banned from campaigning in the state
 chunaav ayog ko ise gambhirtha se sangyaan main lenaa chahie
 Salman and Beni have violated the Election Model Code
 ’ paryaton rajyamantri ahamed ne pradhanmantri se muslim aarakshan par sthiti spasht karne ko bhi kaha
 The comments unhone kaha, ‘chunki manmohan singh kii sarkaar he isliye muslim aarakshan par unhen bolnaa chahie 
 The government is silent while its ministers are speaking
 ’ baharhaal unase jab poocha gaya ki kya yahi maang vah khurshid ke liye kar rahe hai to ahamed ne naa main jawaab diya or kaha, ‘kanoon mantri chunaav ayog se maafee maang chuke hai
 'he insisted that Beni Prasad Verma and Salman Khurshid' were not listening to the Election Commission
 chunaav ayog ko is bare main gambhir hona padegaa
 ' ahamed ne kaha, ‘ve bakawaas kar rahe hai
 They are fooling people
 agar sarkaar gambhir he to iske paas ranganath mishra ayog or sachhar ayog kii report he
 Why doesn't she implement his recommendations
 ’ chunaav ayog ne yah pataa lagaana shuru kar diya he ki kal raat farukhabad kii raily main benny prasad verma kii alpsankhyakon ko cote ke tahat kota dene kii tippanee chunaav aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he athwa nahin
 It has also sought a transcript of Verma's remarks from a private news channel
 trinmul congress ke netaa sultan ahamed ne congress ke is tark ko bhi khaarij kar diya ki adarsh chunavi aachaar samhita kaa koi vaidhanik darja nahin he
 Ahmed said, "when the matter of other parties comes, it is a code of conduct but it does not mean anything for the ruling party
 yah ascharyajanak he
 First, Salman Khurshid said that Muslims should be given nine per cent reservation, whereas there was no such decision at the government level
 ’ unhone kaha ki ab benny prasad aisa kar rahe hai
 He believes that Muslims are quite important
 aisa nahin hone vaala he
 If the government is serious about giving something like this to the Muslims, then it should be announced at the government level
 verma ne kal raat congress mahasachiv digvijay singh or kendriya kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid kii upasthiti main chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha, ‘muslimon ke liye aarakshan badhaayaa jayega or agar chunaav ayog chaahe to vah mujhe notice jari kar saktaa he
 ' ahamed se yah poochne par ki kya vah uttarapradesh chunaavon main verma ko pratibandhit karne kii maang karte hai to unhone kaha, ‘bilkul
 The Election Commission can ban such leaders
 unhen (benny) rajya main chunaav prachaar karne se pratibandhit kar dena chahie
 The Election Commission should take it seriously into consideration
 salmaan or benny ne chunaav adarsh samhita kaa ulanghan kiya he
 'minister of State for Tourism Ahmed also asked the Prime Minister to clarify the situation on Muslim reservation
 tippaniyan He said , 'since Manmohan Singh has a government, he should speak on Muslim reservation
 sarkaar chup he jabaki iske mantri bol rahe hai
 However, when asked if he was making the same demand for Khurshid, Ahmed replied in the negative and said, "law Minister has apologized to Election Commission
" ’ unhone jor dekar kaha ki benny prasad verma or salmaan khurshid ‘chunaav ayog kii baton par gaur nahin kar rahe

 In September 1948, the Nizam's representative in London and his Foreign Minister Moin Nawaz Jung deposited £ 1,007,940 and nine shillings (today this amount has been £ 350 million) in the account of the High Commissioner of Pakistan when the Indian Army Hyderabad Was heading towards bank ne 20 sitambar, 1948 ko sthanantaran kii prakriya shuru kii tab tak nizaam kii senaaon ne bhartiya sena ke major general je
 N
 choudhary ke saamne aatmasamarpan kar diya tha
 a few days after that, the Nizam asked the National Westminster Bank to transfer the money back to his account
 tab pakistan ne us rakam par yah kehete hue apana daawa thok diya ki nizaam ne ye paise use uphaar ke rup main yaa hathiyaaron kii aapurti ke bhugtan ke rup main hastantarit kiye the
 After the Nizam's death in 1967, the Government of India also jumped into this legal battle and with this money also claimed the famous gems that once belonged to the Nizam
 350 lakh pound kii rakam ke saath ab unhen jo milane vaala he, vah 24 saal pehle kii tulana main bahut adhik hoga, jab nizaam ke beshkeemtee aabhushan or ratna nilaam hue the
 It is not clear how the Nizam's wealth will be divided
 unke 34 bacchon main se nizaam kii keval ek beti jinda hai
 His 10 sons and daughters did not have children, yet the Nizam had 104 grandchildren, some of whom have passed away
 unki agali do peedhishon ke kareeb 400 sadsy yaa to bharat main hai yaa phir videshon main ja based hai
 Najaf Ali Khan says, "nowhere is it written that only two grandchildren are entitled to this wealth
" agar maamla aisa hi tha, jaisaa ki daawa kiya ja rahaa he, to ve 2013 tak chup kyon baithe the? agar bantwaare ke masale ko sauhardpurn tareeke se hal nahin kiya gaya to ham adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataayenge
 There are many other dimensions to this controversial question
 masalan, kya us dhan ko, jo hyderabad or bharat kaa ho saktaa he, kisi vyakti ko diya ja saktaa he? britain kii adaalat main bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale adhivaktaa harish salve kehete hai, ''main kah nahin saktaa ki itihaaskaaron kii dilchaspee is baat main hogi, jo saarvajanik rup se pakistan kah chukaa he ki yah rakam nizaam ne unki sena yaa phir rajaakar milicia ko hathiyaaron kii aapurti ke badale di thi

 html Basamelva in the heart of Madhya Pradesh and the central region holds the key to state power
 is kshetra ko jite bina satta ke singhaasana tak nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 This is the reason Kikangress president Rahul Gandhi will blow the election bugle in Malwa region to end 15 years of exile in power in Madhya Pradesh
 rahul gandhi madhya pradesh ke malwa-nimad ilaake do divasiy daure par pahunch rahe hai
 The BJP has a strong and strong hold on this area
 congress ke liye is ilaake main bijepi ko maat die bagaiyr satta main vaapasi sambhav nahin he
 Out of the total 230 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh, Malwa and Madhya Pradesh have 86 seats
 congress ke liye asal chunaati inhen donon ilaake ke ujjain, indore or bhopal sahit 10 bade jilon kii siten hai
 In the 2013 assembly elections, out of these 86 seats, the Congress could win only 10 seats
 in donon kshetron main bijepi 50 fisadi se zyada vot hasil karne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Out of 50 seats in Malwa region, BJP has 45 seats
 jabaki congress ke paas mahaj chaar siten hai
 The BJP has two big leaders in the Malwa region, Kailash Vijayvargiya from Indore and Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan
 haalanki, bijepi kaa ye durg darakta hua najar aa rahaa he
 Last year, several farmers were killed in police firing during the Kisan agitation in Mandsaur in Malwa area
 iske lekar congress ko is kshetra main apni ummid najar aa rahi he
 Apart from this, resentment of upper caste in Ujjain region also poses a new problem for Bejeppi
 malwa ilaaka kaaphi dharmik kshetra mana jaataa he
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan started his Jan Aashirvad Yatra from Mahakaleshwar Temple in Ujjain in the presence of BJP President Amit Shah
 haalanki congress adhyaksharahul gandhigujrat kii tarj par madhya pradesh ke har daure main ek na ek pramukh mandir jaakar maathaa tech rahe hai
 By adopting Rahul's path of soft Hindutva, it is proving very helpful in breaking the anti-hinduist image of the Congress
 gujarat main congress ko iskaa phayda bhi mila he
 This is the reason why Rahul continued to visit the temple in Madhya Pradesh
 bijepi se ucch jatiyon kii narazgi or basapa se gathbandhan kaa na hone se congress ko lagata he ki brahman matadaata party main vaapasi kar sakate hai
 Rahul will also visit the Mahakaleshwar Temple in Ujjain later this month
 jabaki chambal-gwalior daure kii shuruuaat unhone maa pitambara devi ke darshan se kiya he
 Apart from this, Gandhi had performed Narmada Aarti during his visit to Jabalpur last week
 rahul ne chitrakoot se madhya pradesh kaa chunavi bigul foonka tha
 He started an election campaign in the Vindhya region by offering prayers at the Kamanatha temple
 congress ne usee mandir se bhagwaan ram dwaara 'ram gaman path yatra' kii 2 oktober se shuru kii thi
 Though the administration had banned the yatra due to election conduct, but this yatra was successful in conveying its message
 bijepi ke majboot kile ko dharaashahee karne ke liye congress netaa aapasi matbhedon ko bhulaakar in dinon ek najar aa rahe hai
 Jyotiraditya Scindia, state president Kamal Nath and former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh are seen together
 congress agar ummidavaaron ke chayan main bhi ekamat banaae rakhti he, to phir bijepi kii mushkilon bhari ho jaaegi

 ) The tradition of touching the feet to greet elders has been around for centuries
 sanathan dharm main apane se bade ke aadar ke liye charan sparsh uttam mana gaya he
 There are several advantages of direct and indirect phase touch
 
 
 1
 To touch the stage means to bow before someone with full devotion
 isse vinamrata aati he or man ko shanti milti he
 At the same time, the step toucher also manages to impress others with his conduct
 2
 When we touch the feet of a respected person, as a blessing, their hand touches the upper part of our head and our hand touches their feet
 aisi manyata he ki isse us poojaneey vyakti kii positive energy aashirwad ke rup main hamaare sharir main pravesh karti he
 This leads to our spiritual and mental development
 3
 It has been said in the scriptures that everyday greetings of elders increase in age, learning, fame and strength
 4
 The scientific side of it is like this: according to Newton's law, all things in the world are bound by the law of gravity
 saath hi gurutv bhaar sadaiv aakarshith karne vaale kii taraf jaataa he
 The same rule applies to our body
 sir ko uttari dhruv or pairon ko dakshini dhruv mana gaya he
 This means that gravity energy or magnetic energy always enters from the North Pole and flows towards the South Pole and completes its cycle
 yani sharir main uttari dhruv (sir) se sakaaratmak urja pravesh kar dakshini dhruv (pairon) kii ore pravaahit hoti he
 This energy is stabilized in an unlimited amount at the South Pole
 pairon kii ore urja kaa centre ban jaataa he
 We are called 'step touch' for the reception of this energy through the hands by the feet
 5
 Charan touch and Charan Vandana symbolize civilization and virtue in Indian culture
 6
 It is believed that power is also transmitted through the toe
 manushya ke paanv ke anguuthe main bhi urja prasaarit karne kii shakti hoti he
 7
 manyata he ki bade-bujurgon ke charan sparsh niyamit taur par karne se kai pratikul grah bhi anukool ho jate hai
 8
 iskaa manovaigyanik paksh yah he ki jin lakshyon kii prapti ko man main rakhkar bado ko pranaam kiya jaataa he, us lakshya ko paane kaa bal miltaa he
 9
 yah ek prakaar kaa sookshm vyaayaam bhi he
 Touching the feet is a physical exercise
 jhukkar pair chune, ghutane ke bal baithkar pranaam karne yaa sashtaang dandavat se sharir lacheela banataa he
 10
 aage kii ore jhukne se sir main rakt pravaah badhata he, jo sehat ke liye phydemand he
 11
 pranaam karne kaa ek phayda yah he ki isse hamaara ahankaar kam hota he
 For these reasons, the tradition of paying obeisance to elders has been given the form of rules and rites
 dhyaan rakhane vaali baat yah he ki keval unheen ke charan sparsh karnaa chahie, jinke aacharan thik hon
 There is also a direct relationship between 'phase' and 'conduct'

 If there is no alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress in Delhi, now there are reports of a crack in the Congress itself
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ajay maakan or pisi chaako dwaara chalaaye ja rahe shakti ap ke survey par shila dikshit ne naaraazgi jataai he
 In view of the Lok Sabha elections in Delhi, whether there is an alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress or not, but the internal discord in the Congress Party has started coming to the fore on this issue
 dilli congress kii adhyaksh shila dikshit ne kaaryakartaaon ke bich chal rahe survey par tippanee karte hue kaha ki unhen nahin pataa ki pisi chaako or ajay maakan aisa kyon karvaa rahe hai
 So on the survey of Shakti App, former Congress President Ajay Maken said that it is doing Rahul Gandhi's team and in such a situation it is not right to question it within the party
 maakan ne kaha ki pisi chaako ke audio se survey shakti ap ke madhyam se kiya ja rahaa he
 Which is run by AICC
 unhone kaha ki kaaryakartaaon se puch kar nirnay lene kii baat hamaari party kar rahi he, isse acchhee baat or kya ho sakati he
 Maken said that even during the time of the state president, the party had decided only after asking the workers
 loksabhaa chunaav main ummidavaar kaise hon yah bhi party kaaryakartaaon se puch rahi he
 In such a situation, the coalition is also being consulted, so it is a welcome step
 shila dikshit ke aitraaj par maakan ne kaha ki ham to sirf yah kah rahe hai ki is baat ko koun bura kahegaa ki party ke kaaryakartaaon se poocha ja rahaa he
 The party workers should be consulted by party workers
 tabhi to party ke kaaryakarta khush honge
 Maken said the Shakti app runs through Rahul Gandhi
 pisi chaako ke paas 52000 kaaryakartaaon ke number nahin he
 This is happening only on the instructions of Rahul ji
 shakti ap rahul gandhi kii team chalaati he
 It is Rahul Gandhi's decision to conduct this kind of survey
 agar koi congress main rahul gandhi kii is muhim par sawaal uthaa rahaa he to yah galat he
 Describing the survey as internal democracy, Maken said who would oppose asking activists for opinions, it reflected internal democracy in the party

 The BJP promised to make these files public when the government was formed at the Center in the 2014 general elections
 lekin, baad main bijepi ne is maamle main yutern le liya tha
 a senior Congress leader said in an informal conversation that in the Lok Sabha elections 2014, from the Varanasi parliamentary constituency, the party will come up with a name that will be shocking
 
 
 jab patrakaron ne poocha ki narendra modi ke khilaaf aisa majboot ummidavaar koun hoga, varisht congressi netaa ne mazaakia lahaze main kaha, "vah majboot ho yaa kamazor, chaunkenge to aap donon hi haalat main na
 
 
 " beshak yah baat mazaaq main kahi gai thi, lekin varanasi seat par ummidavaari ko lekar congress ke bheetar chal rahi maathapai ko saaf bayaan karti he
 
 
 Be a Brahmin, be a local, be a big name
 
 
 kai maapdandon ke tahat alag-alag naamon par vichaar chal rahaa he, or digvijay singh kaa naam is daud main wildcard antry jaisaa he
 
 
 Although a big leader associated with Uttar Pradesh is dismissing the possibility of Digvijay Singh and Pramod Tiwari's candidature, those who are excited about Digvijay Singh's name are making several arguments in favor of it
 
 
 sabase pehali daleel yah he ki digvijay singh congress kaa ek bada cheharaa hai
 
 
 He has been speaking out fiercely against Narendra Modi
 
 
 chaahe tivi par hon yaa soshal media par, unhone modi ko har maukey par gherne kii koshish kii he
 
 
 Bringing Digvijay Singh against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in Lok Sabha Elections 2014 will only send a message to the general public that the Congress is so serious about stopping Modi that he has made one of his biggest leaders Put one at stake, and the message will go that the Congress does not want to give Modi a free walk under any circumstances
 
 
 vyaktigat taur par digvijay singh ke lihaaz se dekhen to apana naam aage karnaa unhen bhi suut karata he
 
 
 Recently, when his name came to the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh, he was believed to have taken a safe route to the Rajya Sabha, fearing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 
 
 rajyasabha main vah chune ja chuke hai, or yadi ab vah loksabhaa chunaav ladate hai to yah sandesh jayega ki vah rajyasabha kii seat se chipak nahin rahe hai
 
 
 Therefore, when NDTV India asked Digvijay Singh via SMS on Wednesday whether he was going to contest against Narendra Modi, he replied, "absolutely, why not if my party asks me to do so
" 
 
 " By the way, Digvijay Singh Varanasi has been coming and going continuously, and it is believed that his networking is also good there
 
 
 lekin aisa bhi nahin he ki sab kuch unki ummidavaari ke paksh main hi ho
 
 
 Digvijay Singh is considered the Chanakya of the Congress party, and he has an important role in deciding the electoral strategy of the Congress
 
 
 vah congress waar-room ke sakriy sadsy hai
 
 
 In such a situation, if he contests the Lok Sabha elections, that too against Modi, then he will have to give more and more time, so that he will not get much time for the party's election strategy, so the party must think a lot before making any decision in his name
 Will have to

 This time, President Ramnath Kovind himself came to the beginning and Rajnath Singh could not stop himself from coming here for the first time as Home Minister, who visited Nagaland
 ise saamaajik-saanskrithik taane-bane kii bunaavat ko ubhaarne-nikhaarane kaa aujaar banane par iske aayojakon kii unhone peeth bhi thonki
 It became clear that it is not called the Festival of Festivals
 is jalse main sari janajatiyon ke log kishama heritage village main jutate hai or apane-apane lokanrity, natya or duusari kalaayen pesh karte hai
 Here you are introduced to their lifestyle, small and big events in the village, wedding celebrations, mass feast on good harvests, easy ways to handle small and big fights

 yahaan gharon ko morung kehete hai
 The tourists are very fond of their local wine prepared from rice, which is offered in bamboo glass and bamboo straw
 har janajati kaa apana vishesh khanpan or use banane kii vividh vidhi hoti he
 Yes, if you are a vegetarian, then check these variety foods before enjoying them, because here you will be told "chicken" when you ask about veg food

 The thing that attracts your attention every moment throughout the festival is the multi-colored dress of these tribals and the positive smile floating on their faces every moment
 apane kapade ye log khud apane haathon se banaate hai, jisamen resham, kapaas, tamaam tarah ke jeevon ke pankh, naakun, daant haddiyaan or chamade vagairah kaa istemaal hota he
 Even the communities advocating animal protection cannot consider it bad because they do not harm any animal without need
 inke vishisht pahanaave, aabhushan, natya, geet yaa haav-bhav ko kisi bhi bhashaa main bayaan kar paanaa mushkil he
 You can get real pleasure just by looking in front

 The size and freshness of the vegetables here will surprise you

 All the tourists were reluctant to take a single byte of Naga Mirchi, but many people took a plate full of Mirchi
 haalanki baad main unki haalat peeche lage medical camp main dekhne laayak thi
 Ambulances and other arrangements were made keeping in view the situation
 aakhri din saanskrithik kaaryakramon ke baad hornbill ke rivaaj ke anusaar khubasurat miss nagaland ne camp fire main aag lagaai
 Tribals and tourists around it had started celebrating that the rains of rain refused to carry it forward

 However, in an interview to a newspaper, Mendipika said, 'I have not said anything on these rumors before and still do not want to say anything

 He started his career as a film journalist in a magazine called Cine Herald
 filmi patrkaar ke rup main shuru hua safar aaajeevan cinema se hi judaa rahaa or baad main vah film nirmaan se jud gaye
 After the initial struggle, BR Chopra made a film called Naya Daur in 1957 with Dilip Kumar and Vyjayanth Mala in the lead roles
 mashinikaran ke badhate prabhaav par kendrit is film ko darshakon ne khub pasand kiya
 Some songs of this film Ude Jab Zulfen Teri, Ye Desh Hai Veer Jawan Ka Adi became very popular and they are still very much liked today
 kuch varsh purv hi is film ko rangeen banaakar phir pradarshit kiya gaya
 BR Chopra did not hesitate to make films even on subjects challenging the society and made films like Law, Misguided, Ittefaq, Dhud, Insaf Ka Scales, Nikah
 jab gane ke bina hindi filmon kii kalpana nahin kii ja sakati thi, us samay bi aar chopra ne kanoon jaisi safal film banaayi jisamen koi gaanaa nahin tha
 BR Chopra, who made serious films, made the comic film 'pati Patni Aur Woh' in 1980
 nirmaataa nirdeshak bi aar chopra ne apane bhai yash chopra or putr ravi chopra ko bhi film nirmaan kii baarikiyaan sikhaayin
 BR Chopra, who was active in films for nearly six decades, was able to cope with the changing mood of cinematographers
 yahi vajah he ki unki filmein har daur main pasand kii gayin

 He produced the Mahabharata serial in the 1980s
 mana jaataa he ki bhartiya tivi jagat kaa yah sarvaadhik lokapriy dharawahik tha or doordarshan par is kaarykram ke prasaaran ke vakt sadaken viraan ho jaati thim
 Later he produced a serial for Doordarshan also named Bahadur Shah Zafar
 antim mughal samraat ke jivan par aadhaarit is dharawahik main ashok kumaar ne pramukh bhoomika nibhaai thi

 lekin haal hi main is sho kii creative diarector priti simos ne is baat kaa khandan kiya he
 In Bangalore, a software engineer allegedly killed his wife with a knife and later committed suicide by jumping from the 13th floor of his residence
 tippaniyan DCP (south) Revanna told reporters that Madhusudan allegedly killed his wife, who was also a software engineer himself, after a night of fights
 unhone kaha ki gusse main madhusudan ne chaaku liya or patni ke sharir ko god diya or uske baad khudakushi karne ke iraade se pankhe se jhul gaya, lekin rassi tut jane ke kaaran vah aisa nahin kar sakaa
 Revanna said that he then attempted suicide by adding kerosene oil, but could not do so because of not getting matches
 iske baad usne imaarat kii 13veen manzil se kud kar apni jivan lila samaapt kar lee
 He said that when this incident happened, his six-year-old daughter was at her grandparents' house in the same area
 disipi (dakshin) revanna ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki madhusudan ne shuukravaar raat jhagade ke baad kathith taur par apni patni kii hatya kar di, jo khud bhi ek software ejeeniyar thi
 He said that angrily Madhusudan took the knife and adopted the wife's body and then swung from the fan with the intention of committing suicide, but could not do so as the rope broke
 revanna ne kaha ki iske baad usne kiraasana tel daal kar aatmahatya kaa prayaas kiya, lekin maachis nahin milane ke kaaran aisa nahin kar sakaa
 He then finished his life by jumping from the 13th floor of the building
 unhone kaha ki jab yah ghatana ghati us samay inaki chah-varshiya beti isi ilaake main apane dada-daadi ke ghar par thi
 Revanna said that he then attempted suicide by adding kerosene oil, but could not do so because of not getting matches
 iske baad usne imaarat kii 13veen manzil se kud kar apni jivan lila samaapt kar lee
 He said that when this incident happened, his six-year-old daughter was at her grandparents' house in the same area
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 kii ladaai ke centre main ab ek baar phir 84 dangon kaa maamla aa gaya he
 While the BJP is already an attacker on this matter, a statement on 84 riots by Congress leader Sam Pitroda has added fuel to the fire
 BJP is bayaan ko vaise hi oochaal rahi he jaise usne 2014 main manishankar ayyar ke bayaan ko uchhaala tha
 There is voting in Delhi and Punjab, that is why BJP is playing on the issue on the front foot, while it is trying to bring the Congress on the back foot
 
 
 
 Will Pitroda's statement prove to be a punishment? In the 2014 elections, when Mani Shankar Aiyar called Narendra Modi a chaiwala, the BJP made him an election issue
 is baar chaukeedaar chor he kaa naaraa uchhla to modi khud chaukeedaar ban baithe, lekin chunaav ke ant main jab sam pitroda ne 1984 dange par tippanee karte hue kah diya


 84 hua to hua
 
 , is par bijepi bifer gai or congress ke khilaaf hallaa bol diya
 In fact, Sam Pitroda had said, 'you (BJP) keep on lying constantly, first lied on us and yesterday you spoke on you
 1984 kaa mudda kya he, aap baat to kariye
 What did you do in five years, what happened in '84
 
 
 aapane kya kiya
 BJP is protesting in Delhi and Punjab over Sam Pitroda's statement
 dilli main chunaav prachaar ke liye bhale hi aaj aakhri din ho, lekin bijepi ne is mudde par akramakata kii abhi shuruyaat bhar kii he
 Because the way it has been sprung up in Delhi by the BJP, there is a readiness to move ahead in Punjab
 baikfoot par kyon he congress?bhartiya janata party jitna 1984 ke dangon par aakraamak ho rahi he congress ke liye mushkilen utani hi badhati ja rahi hai
 Because whenever this issue has been talked about, the Congress is on the back foot
 purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad dilli kii sadakon or desh ke anya rajyon main sikhon ke saath jo hua, usamen kai congress netaaon kaa naam saamne aayaa tha
 Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar are still in the court circle on this issue, while on the issue of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath, Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to surround the Congress
 
 
 
 Why Rajiv Gandhi itself? There is also a discussion in political circles about why Narendra Modi targeted Rajiv Gandhi itself
 darasal, bijepi dilli or punjab main sikh-punjabi samudaay ko target karne kii ranneeti se is baat par aage bad rahi he
 In which Rajiv Gandhi was first described as corrupt and then Sikh riots were uprooted
 bataa den ki indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad rajeev gandhi kaa ek bayaan kaaphi aalochana kaa vishay bana tha
 Regarding the violence after the assassination of Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi said that whenever a big tree falls, the earth shakes a little bit
 jiske baad vah vipaksh ke nishane par lambey samay tak rahe
 Narendra Modi wants to capitalize on this statement of Rajiv Gandhi in his own right
 pitroda ke bayaan par kya bol rahe netaa?jab se sam pitroda kaa bayaan saamne aayaa he, tabhi se bijepi hamalavar he
 First BJP President Amit Shah tweeted and sought his reply, then later Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi surrounded him in his own style
 nakvi ne kaha ki sam pitroda rahul gandhi ke guru nahin balki congress ke guru ghantal hai
 He has said that there is a group of foot intellectuals in the Congress party who keep making such statements
 bijepi is par hamalavar he to vahiin sam pitroda ne apane bayaan par safai di he or kaha he ki bijepi ne unke bayaan main se kuch shabd chun liye hai or unhen hi ghuma firaakar baat kar rahi he
 
 
 
 or kya bol chuke hai pitroda?bataa den ki isse pehle bhi sam pitroda ke kai bayaan congress ke liye mushkil ban chuke hai
 After the recent Balakot Airstrike when he said that an attack cannot be attributed to the whole of Pakistan
 tab bijepi ne kaaphi vivaad kiya tha
 Sam Pitroda also said that the decision of Airstrike was not right
 haalanki, baad main congress ne sam pitroda ke is bayaan se kanni kaat lee thi

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special news letters a decision of Uttarakhand Sports and Education Minister Arvind Pandey, who is often in the discussion due to his statements, is making headlines these days
 darasal, shiksha mantri ne sarkari skulon main mid de mile bhojan karne se pehle bhojan mantra padhane ko kaha he
 However, he also said that it has not been made mandatory
 faisle main saaf taur par kaha gaya he ki sabhi sarkariskulon kii rasoigharamen ye mantra deevaaron par paint kiye jaaenge taaki sabhi bachche inako yaad bhi kar saken
 Not only this, Arvind Pandey also advised Muslim students to learn Sanskrit
 unhone kaha ki muslim samaaj ke log bhi sanskrit sikh len to phayda hoga
 At the same time, the state's main opposition party Congress has become an attacker on this statement of the Education Minister
 congress ke pravaktaa garima dasoni ne shiksha mantri ko salaah di ki bhojan mantra se zyada jaruri pradesh kii shiksha vyavastha ko thik karnaa he
 That is why he has been made a minister
 garima ne aage kaha ki pradesh ke skulon kii dasha bahut kharaab he or 1000 se zyada skool jarjar halaat main hai
 Due to this, both the future and life of many children are in danger and the Education Minister is busy in giving such fruitful decisions instead of focusing on them
 bataa den ki abhi tak uttarakhand main 18, 000sarkari schoolonmen takreeban 1,80,000 chaatr- chatraayen hai
 In such a situation, this decision can also be a means of conveying in abundance
 lekin shiksha mantri ko isse pehle skulon main behatar suvidhaayen dene kii bhi jarurat he
 UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon has strongly condemned the serial bomb blasts in India's economic capital Mumbai
 mahasachiv ke karyaalay se jari ek bayaan main kaha gaya he ki mahasachiv (baan) mumbai main hue is hamale kii ninda karte hai, jisamen bekasoor log maare gaye or kai ghayal ho gaye hai

 america videsh mantri hillari clinton ne in visphoton ke baad kaha ki vah suraksha vaarta par agle hafte prastaavit nai dilli ke daure par jarur jaaengi
 Condemning the attack, Hillary said, "I will visit India next week as part of my pre-planned schedule
" mujhe lagata he ki is vakt bharat kaa saath dene, aapasi sahyog ko badhaane or aatank ke khilaaf apni patibaddhtaon ko dohraane kii sabase adhik jarurat he
 He said that the Indian public has already faced terrorist incidents and we have seen them facing it with courage and resilience
 mumbai visphoton ko avivekpurna karrwai bataate hue america ke aalaa saansadon ne kaha he ki bharat or america ke bich agle hafte hone vaali ranneetik vaarta main aatankwaad se mukaable kaa mudda sheershasth praathamikta par hona chahie
 mps have asked the US to give full support to bring the attackers under the law
 congresonal cocks on india and indian-americans ke sah adhyaksh or congress ke sadsy aid royas or jo croule ne kaha, agle saptaah bharat or america ke bich nai dilli main ranneetik vaarta honi he
 In such a situation, it becomes imperative that the counter-terrorism cooperation between the two countries should be on top priority due to the irrational attacks
 unhone kaha, ham mumbai main nirdosh nagarikon par hue hamale kii ninda karte hai
 Whatever happened cannot be justified
 apane kaaryakshetra se gharon kii ore ja rahe logon par hamalaa nindaneey he
 a statement issued from the office of French President Nicolas Sarkozy said that the city of Mumbai has again experienced terrorist attacks

 According to the statement, at this time France stands with India in the fight against terrorism far more strongly than every time

 The PM said that the demand of the time is that today at least one voter list is there

 The former England off-spinner wants to become mayor of London
 bhartiya mul ke monti (madhusudan singh panesar) ne kaha ki maujuuda meyar sadik khan kaa kaarykaal khatm ho rahaa he or vah khud ko meyar pad kii res main utaarna chaahate hai
 Panesar asked on Love Sports Radio, 'I live in London and i think i am interested in it
 agar maine chunaav ladaa, to kya aap mujhe vot denge
 
 ? gauratlab he ki landan ke meyar ke liye aglaa chunaav 7 may 2020 ko hoga, jo landan essembly chunaav ke saath hoga

 i live in London and i believe i should enter politics gradually
 mere liye landan kaa meyar banane kaa yah behtareen mauka he
 Panesar also listed his priorities
 unhone kaha, 'main sabhi primary or secondary skulon main cricket dekhnaa pasand karuunga
 But in the context of what is happening in London, i would definitely say that i will help people
 log jo chaahate hai, use puraa karne main meri adhik dilchaspee hogi
 'monty Panesar has played full 50 Test matches for England and has taken 167 wickets
 26 vanade international muqablon main unke naam 24 wicket darj hai
 He has played the same T20 International match, in which he got two wickets
 monti ne 2006 main nagpur main bharat ke khilaaf test match khelkar antarrashtriya cricket main padaarpan kiya tha
 In 2017, after 30 years, Monty suddenly surprised him at his grandfather's house at Kochhar Market in Ludhiana
 iphone 8 or iphone 8 Plus kii bikri bharat main shuru ho chuki he
 i have been using iphone 8 for a few days now and you should read the review of the new iphone and decide for yourself what is special and how it is different from the iphone 7 or any other flagship smartphones
 dizin or bild qualitybield quality ke maamle main kaaphi saalon se aipal kaa koi jawaab nahin he or is baar bhi company ne iphone 8 kii bild quality se yah sabit kiya he ki wo is maamle main best he
 Talking about design, for the last two years, the company has been launching iphone with similar design
 luk iphone 7 jaisaa he, lekin feel ke maamle main yah iphone 7 se behatar he
 This time there is a glass back, not aluminum, and it has been carved in such a way that it is quite easy to hold
 antena lines nahin dikhte sirf donon taraf vijible hai
 The camera bump is still there, but this time the flash module has been placed inside the glass back which is fantastic
 iske alaava ab aipal kaa logo tach karne se feel nahin hota, kyonki ise bhi glass ke andar kar diya gaya he
 The bottom of the rear panel has iphone written and there is also certification here
 haalanki america main bikne vaale iphone 8 main aisa likhaa nahin he or clin he
 The speaker grill is at the bottom as usual and this time also the headphone jack is not provided
 said main pehle jaise hi kies hai
 The home button is replaced by haptic feedback that the company brought with the iphone 7
 displepichley kai saalon se aipal apane smartphone main alsidi disple laga rahaa he, jabaki samsung kii pratidwandi samsung apane flagship smartfones main OLED disple detii he jo alsidi se kaaphi behatar hoti he
 This time also Apple has used LCD display in iphone 8
 is baar disple main nayaa ye he ki company ne tru tone technology kaa yuj kiya he jo khud se color temprechar saroundings ke hisaab edjust karata he or yah ek behtareen feechar he
 Screen 4
 7 inch kii he jiskaa rijolushan 1334X750 he yani echdi
 The same is also given in the iphone 7
 disple main duusare badlaav ke taur par brit colors die gaye hai jo ise dekhne or yuj karne main iphone 7 se alag karte hai
 Is the iphone 8 the fastest smartphone in the world? Can you do computer work with it? Is it as fast as Intel's computer processor? There are obviously strange questions
 aaie inke jawaab dhundte hai
 Apple's specialty is that the company designs processors for the iphone itself
 is baar company ne iphone 8 main A11 Bionic procesar lagaaya he or aapako bataa den ki 1 lakh rupee vaale iphone x main bhi yahi procesar laga he
 It is a powerful processor with six active cores, two of which are high performance while four are high efficiency cores
 benchmark riglts ke mutabik iphone 8 pichley sabhi iphone se zyada fast he yahaan tak entry level 13 inch mcbuk pro se bhi fast he
 After using the iphone 8 for a long time, i can say that it is very fast and there is no scope of any hang or slow
 heavi eps, gaming, browjing or mujeec se koi fark nahin padataa
 The phone does not heat up and its processor runs it comfortably and the iphone 8 is not slow
 haalanki agar aap power yujar nahin to aapako shaayad iphone 7 ke mukaable isaki parformens main badlaav na dikhe
 But in heavy usage and gaming, you can easily see the awesomeness of this processor
 ios 11 ke saath iphone 8 hiparloop kii tarah tej chalata he
 If you do not know the hyperloop, then tell it is a concept and in the coming time it will run faster than an airplane
 camerakya iphone 8 kaa camera is planet kaa best smartphone camera he? kya isse delaar kii tarah tasviren clic kar sakate hai? kya isse chand kii tasviir juum karke le sakate hai? chunki 60 hajaar se upar kaa smartphone kharid rahe hai to aise sawaal laazmi hai
 So understand that whatever the iphone 8 camera will not disappoint you
 chaahe raushnee kam ho yaa zyada echdiaar mod par rakhen yaa naa rakhen, sirf auto focus main daalen or iskaa camera best tasviir clic karegaa
 You can mix it with DSLR if you want
 chunki yaha dual camera vaala iphone nahin he isliye isamen depth effecd yaa boke effect jisase becoground bler hota he ye feechar nahin he
 Keep in mind one thing, Samsung smartphones in this segment click pictures that look better
 lekin aipal kaa maananaa he ki wo asli tasviir hi dikhayega, isliye kuch kadavi sachai ke liye bhi taiyaar rahe hai, kyonki yah aaine kii tarah he
 Photos taken from the Galxy Note 8 or Galaxy S8 are saturated, which makes the photos look good
 camera iphone 7 ke mukaable kaaphi behatar to nahin lekin nishchit taur par use acha he
 The iphone can record 4K video at 8 to 60 frames per second, and here you can record 1080p slow motion video at a rate of 240 frames per second if you want to talk about slow motion
 iske liye aapako camera settings main jaakar kuch badlaav karne honge
 In iphhone 7 Plus you get 4K recording up to 30 frames per second
 slo moshan bhi iphone 7 Plus main 720p kar sakenge wo bhi 240 frem prati seconds kii dar se
 Overall, its camera is excellent and is the best camera of this segment
 chaahe video record karnaa ho yaa tasviren clic kerani ho yah kamaal kaa he
 Apart from this, clicking photos is very fast, the eyes will blink before you must have clicked many pictures
 wireles chargingkya iphone 8 bina cabel ke hi charge ho jayega? kya iske liye koi khaas tarah ke tul kii jarurat hogi? kya bina socket main lagaae mobile charge hoga? ji
 The purpose behind giving a glass back to the iphone 8 is that it can be charged wirelessly
 aipal ne Qi wireles charging tech yuj kiya he jise chi pronouns karte hai
 At the moment Apple has not started selling its charging pad, so it can be charged with third party wireless charging
 hamane ise samsung ke wireles charging pad par test kiya he to yah achche se kaam karata he
 The cover can also be charged easily
 haalanki iske jariye fast charging nahin hui
 However, fast charging is also not possible from the cable provided with the company
 bhale hi aapako aipal ne iske saath fast charger nahin diya he, lekin ab iphone 8 main fast charging kaa saport diya gaya he
 For this, any third party charger with more power can be used
 29W ke charger se aap iphone 8 ko lagbhag aadhe ghante main 50 fisadi tak charge kar sakate hai
 The box has an old charger which is 5W
 rivyuu ke dauraan ek baat hamane notice kii he, wo ye ki samsung ke wireles charging pad ke saath thode der main phone halkaa garm hota he
 Augmented reality augmented reality i
e
 AR
 yah ek kadam aage kii technology or feechar he
 If you have played Pokémon Go, it is an augmented reality based game
 saadhaaran shabdon main kahen to ogmented reality ke jariye aap asli surphace par virtual object rakh sakate hai
 The iphone 8 has this feature, but it is now in the iphone 7 and 7 Plus as well
 kyonki ios 11 main aipal ne arkit diya he jo ogmented reality ke liye hi he
 Therefore, this support has been introduced in other iphone as well
 lekin iphone 8 main ogmented reality se jude ap sabase zyada sateek kaam karte hai
 There are some apps on app stores such as Measuring that allows you to measure the table, bed or TV in the house
 iske alaava ogmented reality games iphone 8 par khelnaa ek sukhad anubhav rahaa
 Google has brought some smartphones under the Tango Project, in which such features have been given
 lekin ummid he iphone ke baad ogmented reality duusare bajet smartfones main bhi dekhne ko milenge
 Overall the augmented reality feature is amazing and leaves no stone unturned to make you feel a different world
 kya aapako iphone 8 lenaa chahie?agar aapke paas iphone 7 yaa 7 Plus he to aap iphone x kaa intjaar kar sakate hai
 But you are an Android user and you have to buy an iphone and you do not want to spend a lakh of rupees for this, then this smartphone is best for you
 agar iphone 7 he to thode paise bachaa kar rakhen or iphone x kaa intjaar kar len
 'iphone 8 is a great smartphone, but not revolutionary' Rating till date - 4 / 5 iviem main chhedchhad kii shikaayat lekar shanivaar ko aam aadmi party netaa sanjay singh or raghav chaddha chunaav ayog ke daftar pahunche
 After complaining to the Election Commission, Raghav Chadha told the media that he feared tampering with EVM
 iske alaava unhone chunaav se sambandhit dastavejon se bhi chhedachad kaa shaq jaahir kiya
 He said that in an election diary, the EVM number, the number of votes was recorded by the Election Officer on 12 May, but 4 days later some officers were called to re-create the diary
 raghav ne kaha ki isaki jaankaree chunaav adhikari ne hi di he
 Therefore, we decided to complain to the Election Commission itself
 chunaav ayog kagaji karrwai karata he to sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko jaankaree deni chahie, lekin aisa nahin hua
 Speaking further, Raghav Chadha said that questions are also being raised about the safety of where evms and postal ballots are kept
 iviem kaa form bharne ke baad koi badlaav nahin hota, lekin 3 vidhansabhaon main iviem ke form phir se bharwaaye gaye
 What is the intention behind this? strong room main iviem band hone ke baad bhi koi kaarywahi hoti he to sabase pehle pratyaashiyon ko isaki jaankaree di jaati he
 He said that on Friday, why do RO and other officials of South Delhi Lok Sabha open the room in which the postal ballot was kept? Was the new EVM that opened to keep? The EVM Strong Rooms were closed at 11 am on the 13th
 6-7 ghante iviem kahaan rahi
 The party leader alleged that the Election Commission is losing credibility
 aam aadmi party ke netaa sanjay singh bhi chunaav ayog par gambhir aarope lagaate hue unhone kaha ki ayog kya kar rahaa he? iviem ke saath kya ho rahaa he
 The RO of East Delhi knew in which room the evms were kept and he was in the same room for some time
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki pratyaashee hone ke naate raghav chaddha bhi is bare main jaananaa chaahate hai or iske bare main raghav ne chunaav ayog se bhi shikaayat kii he, lekin kisi ne shikaayat ko gambhirtha se nahin liya
 The Election Commission should keep evms in a safe place
 chunaav ayog kii vishwasaneeyata ek baar phir kathghare main hai
 Questions are again being raised on how the Election Commission functions

 mahaan nirdeshak gurudutt 10 oktober 1964 main mumbai main apane bistar main rahasyamay sthiti main mrit paye gaye the
 He is said to have committed suicide in 1964 after battling alcohol addiction for a long time
 jaaniye us raat kii kahani
 
 
 What is the story? Guru Dutt's brother Devi Dutt believes that it was not a suicide
 unhen lagata he ki ye drug overdoj kii vajah se hua oxident tha
 He told how he was on the set of the film Baharan Phir Bhi Aayegi with Guru Dutt and the Guru looked absolutely fine and healthy at that time
 haalanki, baad main ek lead star ne shoot ko cancil kar diya or guru dutt naaraaz ho gaye
 Because of this, he had to change his plan for the next day
 devi or guru dutt saath milakar kolaba main shopping karne gaye, jahaan unhone guru ke beton-tarun or arun ke liye chijen kharidin
 The two then returned (at 7 pm) to Guru Dutt's apartment on Pedder Road, where Guru lived without his family
 unka sahaayak ratan unke saath rahata tha
 The Guru wanted to spend time with his children
 iske liye unhone raat 10 baje apni patni gita dutt ko kol kiya or bacchon ko bhejne ke liye kaha
 Both were on the verge of breaking up
 gita ne unhen manaa kar diya kyonki raat bahut ho chuki thi
 Guru Dutt got upset due to this
 unhone gusse main patni se kaha tha beti ko bhej do varna meraa mara munh dekhogi
 At 12 o'clock they started preparing for food
 khate-khate 1 baj gaya
 Later Guru Dutt asked Bhai Devi Dutt to leave as Writer / Director Abrar Alvi was to come to discuss the idea with him
 donon kaa saath main sharaab pite hue kaam karne kaa iraadaa tha
 After this, Devi Dutt left the apartment to Bhai Guru Dutt
 unhone ye nahin sochaa tha ki iske thik 24 ghanton baad ve apane bhai guru dutt se kabhi baat nahin kar paaenge
 At 3 pm, Gurudutt came out of his room and started asking for liquor
 jab ratan ne sharaab dene se manaa kiya to unhone khud bottle uthaai or kamare main chale gaye
 No one knows what happened after this
 10 oktober ko guru dutt kamare main mrit paae gaye
 Let me tell you that Guru Dutt was the first such director to get the audience aware of the specifics of the films
 gurudutt kii story teling kii kshamta adwitiya thi
 In his praise, filmmaker Anwar Jamal had said - Gurudutt had set the standard in the production of crime thriller films
 unki filmon main kahani kii kai tahen dikhaai detii hai
 He was one of the film makers who understood the socio-political scenario
 unki filmon main koi cheez bevajaah nahin milti thi
 Talk about personal life, Togurudatta's father's name was Shivshankar Rao Padukone
 maa vasanti padukon kii najar main gurudutt bachapan se hi bahut natkhat or ziddee the
 It was his nature to keep asking questions
 kabhi-kabhi unke sawaalon kaa jawaab dete-dete maa pareshaan ho jaati thim

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichley baras sitambar main jab ghar-ghar bijli pahunchane ke liye saubhaahgya yojana shuru kii to khud unhone bhi nahin sochaa hoga ki yah yojana naksal prabhavit chhattisgarh jaise soobe ke duurastha anchalon ke bashindon ke liye vardaan ban jaaegi
 Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Dr
 raman singh kii sarkaar ne is yojana ko kaamyaab banane ke liye bijli tihaar yani bijli tyohaar manaanaa shuru kiya
 To encourage the people, the government is not only organizing camps in the villages, but the electricity department is also organizing electricity tihars in the villages with 100 percent electricity connections
 is yojana main bijli conection lene vaale graminon ke saath hi gram panchayat ke pramukh ko prashasti-patr dekar sammanit kiya ja rahaa he
 This is the reason that in less than two months, power has reached 1
5 lakh homes
 yah yojana kii kamyaabi hi he ki jin gaanvon ke logon ne kabhi bijli nahin dekhi, ab unka gaanv roshan ho rahaa he
 These are villages and houses where it was difficult to carry electricity
 vaise bhi, chhattisgarh kii bhugolic sthiti vipareet he
 Especially in tribal villages, houses are far away
 ek ghar ke liye chaar se paanch khambhe lagane padate hai
 Siddharth Komal Singh Pardeshi, Secretary, Department of Energy, says, "in the coming time, our growth is going to increase further
 ham har maheene ek lakh se adhik conection dene kii sthiti main honge
 "well, being a power-producing state, Chhattisgarh has always been a surplus state, except peak hours
 lekin, sudur ilaakon or dhur naksal prabhavit kshetron ke chah lakh se adhik ghar bijli se vanchit hai
 Chhattisgarh Electricity Distribution Company Executive Director H
K
 aar
 Narvare says, "the Saubhagya scheme started in October but the original work started from late December
 fark yah he ki pehle log aavedan karte the or ab ham khud gaanvon main camp lagaakar logon ko bijli conection lene ke liye protsaahit kar rahe hai
 Under this scheme, 6,24,000 houses in Chhattisgarh were identified for providing electricity connections
 inamen se dedh lakh se adhik gharon main bijli pahunchaai ja chuki he
 This has happened in just two months whereas in the first year we used to put two to two and a half lakh new connections
 ''vaise, sarkaar ne rajya ke sabhi bina bijli vaale gharon main bijli pahunchane ke liye sitambar, 2018 kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 Narvare says, "in this case, we can further say that we have awarded the entire work after the tender
 ''saubhaahgya yojana ke tahat kharch kaa 60 fisadi hissaa centre sarkaar vahan karti he, 10 fisadi hissaa rajya detaa he or shesh 30 pratishat kharch vitaran companiyaan uthaati hai
 The Center has set a target to complete the scheme in March, 2019 across the country, but on completion of electrification of all the houses included in the scheme in December 2018, 15 percent of the central government approved scheme will be given to the states as additional grant
 Will provide 832 karod ru
 Of course, more than half the amount will be given by the central government
 chhattisgarh main isi saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Perhaps this is also why the work of the state government has gained momentum
 saubhaahgya yojana ke antargat pradesh ke garibi rekha se neeche rah rahe (bipiel) pariwaron ko muft main bijli conection die jane kaa praavdhaan he
 The benefit of this scheme will also be available to the families above the poverty line (APL), but the beneficiary will have to pay a fee of 500 rupees for providing electricity connection to the families of such families, which will be provided to the beneficiary to repay in ten installments
 iskaa matlab he hitgrahi ko prayek maah 50 rupye masik kist ke rup main chukaane honge
 Officials say that the scheme will directly benefit the beneficiaries living in remote areas, who till now were unable to use electricity due to lack of money to install service lines
 company ke emdi ankit anand kehete hai, ''pradesh ke aise gaanvon, majaratolon or basaahaton main jahaan bijli kii line le janaa dushkar he, vahaan is yojana ke antargat saura urja ke madhyam se bijli pahunchane kaa bhi lakshya he
 The 240 villages of Abujhmad in Bastar, known as the impenetrable stronghold of the Naxalites, are now illuminated with solar lights because of the Saubhagya scheme
 abujhmaad vah ilaaka he, jahaan pichley chaar dashak main kabhi police nahin gai
 There are not only training centers for Naxalites but also arms manufacturing factories
 aise ilaake ke 240 gaanvon main jab solar lite pahunchi to centre sarkaar ke afasar bhi hairaan rah gaye
 Collector of Narayanpur District T
 pi
 Verma has been included in the Innovation category of the Prime Minister's Award for this work
 verma puraskaar ke liye chaynit hone ke liye screening ke tisare charan main pahunch gaye hai
 Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Dr
 raman singh ne india today se kaha, ''hamaara uddeshy har gaanv, har basti or har ghar tak bijli pahunchaana he
 In seven districts of Bastar, six lakh people do not have electricity in their homes, they will be given electricity connection under Saubhagya scheme
 abujhmaad main 50,000 pariwaron ke gharon main solar set lagaaya jayega
 He credited this to the bjp's 14-year rule and said that remember 14 years ago, when electricity was less and more was going
 jaahir he, mukhyamantri is yojana kii kamyaabi ko chunavi mudde ke taur par janata ke saamne pesh karenge
 In the Saubhagya Scheme, the Government of Chhattisgarh has thrown its full force
 aisa nahin he ki yojana main dikkatein nahin aa raheen, par sarkaar us par twarit karrwai bhi karti he
 For example, when a complaint was received in the public meeting through video conferencing about the demand for money in the name of installation of meters in Jashpur district, he did not delay in taking action against the engineer
 asli baat sarkaar ke aankadon kii jameen par sachaai dekhne kii he
 The speed at which Raman government is claiming to work is the right of the people left in the pace of development
 bijli kii suvidha se vanchit rah gaye gharon main agar lagaataar bijli mil saki to jaahir he, soobe main vikaas kii nai dhara bahani shuru hogi or hinsa samet kai samasyaon kaa samaadhaan mumkin ho paaegaa
 With the enthusiasm with which Raman government is pushing this plan, it seems that the BJP is seeing its political good fortune in the state and is in the process of celebrating its election Tihar

 Amid the controversy over a Major allegedly tying a man in front of a jeep as a human shield against stone pelters in Kashmir, Defense Minister Arun Jaitley said army officials are free to take decisions in war-like areas 
 jetali ne major litul gogoi ke kadam kaa vishesh zikr karte hue kaha ki sainya kaa samaadhaan sainya adhikari hi muhaiyaa karaate hai

 80 fisadi purushon kaa maananaa he ki adarsh mahilaon kaa milanaa mushkil he lekin mahilaon ke liye khushkhabari ye he ki purush mahilaon ko unki khaamiyon ke baavjood pasand karte hai
 According to a new survey in Britain, four out of five men prefer women despite their flaws
 2,000 purushon par kiye gaye surveykshan main shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki kisi bhi vyakti ne apane saathi ko adarsh nahin bataaya

 In this research, it was found that most men consider their peers to be only 67 percent ideal
 ek anya shikaayat jiske kaaran purush apane saathi ko adarsh nahin maanate, vah he unka kisi bhi baat ko bada bana dena, unki gaadi chalaane kii aalochana karnaa or serialon ko dekhne ke liye lalayit rahanaa
 Taking time to prepare is also paramount in the complaint of men, which prevents them from considering women as models
 10 main se 6 purushon kaa maananaa he ki unki premika jaanboojhkar unke poshaak pahanane ke tareekon or unke khanpan ko badalanaa chaahati hai

 haalanki lagbhag 47 fisadi purush is baat se sahamat hote hai ki unki vartmaan saathi hi unki pasandida saathi he or uske saath ve jivan bitaana chaahate hai

 sibiesai ne 12 march ko kaksha 10veen kii angreji kii pariksha yojit kii thi
 After the paper, when many students were asked about the question paper, most of the students described the paper as easy and short
 aksar angreji kaa paper kaaphi lanbaa aata he lekin is saal chaatro ko paper puraa karne main koi pareshaani nahin hui
 The students said that all the questions were asked from celebs of NCERT
 aisa koi bhi prashn nahin tha jo samaj main na aae
 All the questions came from the celebs themselves
 CBSE board pariksha main 28 lakh se zyada chaatr le rahe hai hissariting section or grammer section kii vajah se angreji kaa paper lanbaa ho jaataa he
 Which students cannot complete in 3 hours
 lekin is baar zyaadaatar chaatro ne bataaya ki paper 30 minute pehle hi puraa kar liy tha
 After which there was also time to revise the paper
 CBSE 12TH EXAM: aasaan tha angreji kaa paper, yahaan dekhen- puraa analysisbta den, angreji ke paper main zyada dar chaatro ko grammer section se lagata he
 But this year the questions of Grammar section were also quite easy
 iske alaava zyaadaatar chaatro ne kaha ki ve is pariksha main 70 ank se adhik ank aasaani se aa sakate hai
 On March 12, the Punjab School Education Board also conducted the 10th English test

 philhal is faisle ke baad shaashvat ke paas ab court main sarender karne ke alaava koi doosraa vikalp nahin he
 Most senior BJP leaders believe that this is the only option to avoid the criticism of the party in this matter
 lekin dekhnaa he ki shaashvat, jinhone is praathmiki ko radd karaane ke liye patna hoicourt main bhi yachika daayar kii he vah uske faisle kaa intjaar karte hai yaa somvaar ko sarender karte hai? An analogy of dialogue between the government and the public is currently spreading sensation across the country
 koshish puri hui ki yah nazaaraa kisi tarah janata ke bich pahunch na paae,lekin zamana soshal media kaa he
 During the 'janata Durbar' of the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, the scene of 'tu-tu main-main' which took place during the plea of a citizen from the government was captured in cameras
 vah'janata milan'urf'janata darbar'tha
 It was considered the rarest post-election program in a democratic polity
 lihaaza usamen ghati kisi asaamaanya ghatana ko khabar banane se rokna phizul kii kavayad thi
 Nevertheless, this exercise took place and ultimately proved to be fizzy
 24ghante ke bheetar hi desh ke mukhya media ko is khabar ko chalaanaa hi padaa
 However, the media always has a chance to analyze it with lively news
 is ghatana main bhi hua
 Analyzes to find fault in the behavior of the complainant teacher are prevalent in the media
 alabatta yah philhal zyaada pataa nahin he ki us mahila kii traasadee kitni badi thi
 
 
 The Before the Janata Durbar, where did he complain to solve his problem
 
 
 ?sarkaar kii taraf se sirf ek hi kathanak charchaa main laayaa ja rahaa he ki us mahila ko apni shikaayat rakhane kaa yah uchit manch nahin tha
 That is, it is natural to raise the question, what kind of complaint are there to keep such kind of complaint
 
 
 ?'janata darbar'urf'darbar-e-aam'
 
 
 Some newspapers have propagated the event as 'janata Milan', that is, like a celebration or ceremony
 is prachaar ke zariye yah sabit karnaa aasaan ho gaya ki us mahila dwaara aaveg ke saath apni samasya rakhana anuchit tha
 But the medieval darbar-e-aam's experiences are that the emperors used to call the durbar-e-aam because their courtiers or ministers are not indulging in any persecution or impunity with the public
 
 
 ?usee darbar main shahenshaah kisi kii shikaayat sunakar sabase pehle sambandhit darbari kii taraf ankhen tarerte the
 Other complainants of darbar-e-aam were also overwhelmed by seeing this currency of emperor
 ve shaasha bharsak koshish karte the ki fariyadi ko vahiin ke vahiin raahat de di jaae,or janata ke bich yash badhaayaa jaae,lekin uttarakhand cond main aisa nahin hua
 The Chief Minister started dealing with the complainant himself
 
 
 chaahe aadhunik prabandhan ho,chaahe aadhunik lok prashasan,in vidyyon yaa shastron main padhaayaa-sikhaaya jaataa he ki naagarik yaa karmchaaree kii shikaayat ko tasalli se suna jaae
 Half of the problematic person's pain becomes less when someone hears his problem
 uttarakhand main sarkari shikshakarmi us vidhwaa maa kaa dukh yah tha ki vah lagaataar durgam pahari ilaake ke skool main tainaat he
 She is unable to live with her children
 lihaaza uskaa transfar kar diya jaae
 The trial was just that, but in the meantime, the Chief Minister did not like the complaint of the complainant
 or'tu-tu main-main'ho gai
 It was done in the filled court itself
 mukhyamantri ne tatkaal hi gusse main aadesh de diya ki ise fouran muattal karo,baahar nikaalo
 After all, he was forcibly taken out and told that he was also taken into custody
 gazab yah ho gaya ki sarkaar or naagarik kii'tu-tu main-main'video camaron main record bhi ho gai
 After that, who could stop this news from being discussed all over the country
 
 
 ?kya is samay'janata darbar'kaa auchity he
 
 
 The vah yug alag tha,jab samraat ko pataa chalanaa mushkil tha ki uske darbari kya kar rahe hai
 He also did not know easily what the condition of the public really is
 use bhes badalakar janata ke bich janaa padataa tha
 Durbar-e-mango had to be installed
 lekin aaj to har rajvyavastha main asankhya karmchaaree hai
 In a democracy, there are countless departments to monitor one over the other
 har fariyadi ko khub suvidhaayen hai ki vah aasaani se apni shikaayat darj karaae
 Get it up and down everywhere
 itani suvidhaayen hai ki desh ke har daftar main shikaayatein padhane ke liye afasar tainaat hai
 The only difficulty is that these complaints are not resolved
 darasal,shikayaton ke niptaare ke liye kisi janata darbar kii nahin,filon ko nipataane kii zarurat he
 No chief minister or prime minister has to do much in this, just keep an eye on the behavior of the officers who hear the complaint
 lafde vaali chiz he yah darbar
 
 
 We are a democracy
 sarkaron ko aajkal yah dikhaane kii zyaada zarurat pad rahi he ki ham lok ke prati samvedansheel hai
 But this system is not working, and due to the increasing size of our country, it is not possible for a ruler in a democracy to communicate directly with the public
 uske liye ekatarfa sampreshan hi suvidhajanak he,isiilie ekatarfa bhaashan vaali reliyon ko hi sabase acha auzaar maanane main hi samajhadaari he
 Remarks Yet there is a justification for these courts
 
 
 loktantr main janata darbaron ke auchity par vimarsh shuru karen,to pehali baat yahi niklegi ki ye darbar raajnneetik prachaar kaa ek bahut kargar auzaar hai
 However, the risk of using this strategic tool is also big, which is necessary to reduce these durbars
 yani in raajnneetik kaaryakramon kaa rup suprabandhit natya roopantaran jaisaa ho
 Get trained by the complainant
 bahut sambhav he,kuch samay se chaalu hue in kaaryakramon ke liye aisa hi kiya jaataa ho
 The election of the complainants is done with thought
 in darbaron kii uplabdhyi ke bakhaan ke liye press vijyaptiyaan bhi jugat se banaai jaati hon
 Of course, this connection has been seen to be effective in the courts so far, but it seems that this management went wrong in the court of Uttarakhand
 itnaa zyaada gadabada gaya ki aage se in darbaron ko kargar maanane kii bajaay inke jokhim ko zyaada dekha jayega

 fariyadi se khud nipatane lage mukhyamantri
 
 
 Regardless of modern management, whether modern public administration, in these schools or in the scriptures, it is taught that the grievance of the citizen or the employee should be heard with satisfaction
 samasyagrast vyakti kaa aadha dukh-dard to usee samay kam ho jaataa he,jab koi uski samasya sun le
 The sadness of that widowed mother was that of a government education worker in Uttarakhand, that she is constantly posted in a school in a difficult terrain
 vah apane bacchon ke saath nahin rah paa rahi he
 So it should be transferred
 mukadmaa bas itnaa hi tha,lekin isi bich mukhyamantri ko fariyadi kaa tevar raas nahin aayaa
 And 'tu-tu me-me' is done
 bhare darbar main hi ho gai
 The Chief Minister immediately ordered in a fit of anger that he should immediately change it, get it out
 aakhir use jabaran baahar nikaala gaya or bataate hai ki hiraasat main bhi le liya gaya
 It is amazing that the government and the citizen's 'tu-tu main-main' were also recorded in video cameras
 uske baad is khabar kii deshbhar main charchaa hone se koun roak saktaa tha
 
 
 Is there a justification for 'janata Durbar' at this time
 
 
 ? The era was different, when it was difficult for the emperor to know what his courtiers were doing
 use yah bhi aasaani se pataa nahin chalata tha ki janata kii vaaki haalat kya he
 He had to disguise and go among the public
 darbar-e-aam lagaana padataa tha
 But today there are innumerable employees in every polity
 loktantr main to ek ke upar ek nigaraanee ke liye anginat vibhaag hai
 Every complainant has enough facilities to file his complaint easily
 upar-neeche har jagah kara le
 There are so many facilities that officers are posted in every office of the country to read complaints
 bas mushkil yah he ki in shikayaton kaa nipataara nahin hota
 Actually, there is a need to dispose of files, not of any public court for redressal of grievances
 isamen kisi mukhyamantri yaa pradhanmantri ko zyaada kuch nahin karnaa he,bas,shikaayat sunne vaale afasaron ke chaal-chalan par nigaah rakhni he
 This court is a shoddy thing
 
 
 ham loktantr hai
 Governments are nowadays more required to show that we are sensitive to the people
 lekin bazariyaa vyavastha yah kaam ho nahin paa rahaa he,or apane desh ke badhate aakaar ke chalate yah sambhav nahin ki loktantr main koi shaasha sidhe hi janata se samvaad kar le

 ? The era was different, when it was difficult for the emperor to know what his courtiers were doing
 use yah bhi aasaani se pataa nahin chalata tha ki janata kii vaaki haalat kya he
 He had to disguise and go among the public
 darbar-e-aam lagaana padataa tha
 But today there are innumerable employees in every polity
 loktantr main to ek ke upar ek nigaraanee ke liye anginat vibhaag hai
 Every complainant has enough facilities to file his complaint easily
 upar-neeche har jagah kara le
 There are so many facilities that officers are posted in every office of the country to read complaints
 bas mushkil yah he ki in shikayaton kaa nipataara nahin hota
 Actually, there is a need to dispose of files, not of any public court for redressal of grievances
 isamen kisi mukhyamantri yaa pradhanmantri ko zyaada kuch nahin karnaa he,bas,shikaayat sunne vaale afasaron ke chaal-chalan par nigaah rakhni he
 This court is a shoddy thing
 
 
 ham loktantr hai
 Governments are nowadays more required to show that we are sensitive to the people
 lekin bazariyaa vyavastha yah kaam ho nahin paa rahaa he,or apane desh ke badhate aakaar ke chalate yah sambhav nahin ki loktantr main koi shaasha sidhe hi janata se samvaad kar le

 loktantr main janata darbaron ke auchity par vimarsh shuru karen,to pehali baat yahi niklegi ki ye darbar raajnneetik prachaar kaa ek bahut kargar auzaar hai
 However, the risk of using this strategic tool is also big, which is necessary to reduce these durbars
 yani in raajnneetik kaaryakramon kaa rup suprabandhit natya roopantaran jaisaa ho
 Get trained by the complainant
 bahut sambhav he,kuch samay se chaalu hue in kaaryakramon ke liye aisa hi kiya jaataa ho
 The election of the complainants is done with thought
 in darbaron kii uplabdhyi ke bakhaan ke liye press vijyaptiyaan bhi jugat se banaai jaati hon
 Of course, this connection has been seen to be effective in the courts so far, but it seems that this management went wrong in the court of Uttarakhand
 itnaa zyaada gadabada gaya ki aage se in darbaron ko kargar maanane kii bajaay inke jokhim ko zyaada dekha jayega

 And Cartridge made a mistake by keeping it with her
 lekin saath hi sanjay ne ye bhi kaha ki wo aatankwaadi nahin hai kyonki mananeey supreme court ne unhen TADA (tebrist and diserptive activities) act se jude sabhi maamalon main bari kiya he
 TADA was in force in the country between 1985 and 1995
 'panchajnya' main sanjay par bani byopic film 'sanju' main anderworld or abhinayta ke kharaab pahaluon kaa 'mahimamandan' kiye jane par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa gaya he
 'sanju' is going to cross the 300 crore mark at the box office
 india today ke saath exclusive intervyuu main sanjay dutt ne kabool kiya ki AK-56 ko apane paas rakhana bhul thi
 When Sanjay Dutt was asked what was going on in his mind while keeping the rifle nearby and why he felt the need for an assault rifle, he said, 'it was a mistake
 main ye nahin kah rahaa ki maine sahi kaam kiya tha
 i have paid for my work
 'kya tha bharat se bheje un tepe main, jise sunakar badal gai sanju kii jindagisanjay dutt jald hi bade parde par 'sahib, bivi or gangster 3' main villen kaa kirdaar nibhaate najar aaenge

 MN Singh told noted journalist Shekhar Gupta that if Sanjay Dutt had told his father Sunil Dutt instead of concealing the rifle, the blasts could have been prevented in Mumbai
 is par sanjay dutt ne kaha, 'vaah! emen singh ne aisa kaha? aap unheen se kyon nahin poochhate
 They are going against the Supreme Court's decision by saying so
 'is shaks ne kaha tha hiraani se sanju par film banane ko, nahin the rajisanjay dutt ne rifl ko chupaane kii baat se inkaar kiya
 Sanjay also challenged MN Singh to argue about this claim
 sanjay dutt ne kaha, 'aap kya samajhate hai ki main kaise giraftaar hua? aaie bahes karte hai
 This is surprising
 kaise ek pratishthit police adhikari itani halki baat kar saktaa he
 In the '80s and' 90s, it was considered common for actors to appear in parties in Dubai with dangerous gangsters like Dawood Ibrahim
 lekin ab film stars apni chhavi ko lekar adhik satark hai

 i do not remember the name
 maine aisi koi diary bhi nahin rakhi
 Sanjay said - no one will spend 25-30 crore rupees to change the image: Sanjay Dutt said that Ranbir Kapoor, who played his character in 'sanju', must have had more than 10 women in his life, which does not match the statement of the young actor
 Account that he did not cross the figure of more than 10 as compared to Sanjay Dutt's 308
 sanjay dutt ne mana ki sanju ko dekhte hue ve bhavuk ho gaye the or aakhirkaar aansuon par kaabo nahin paa sake
 Sanjay Dutt said, 'it was difficult to live my life again
 film ko dekhte hue maine lambey samay tak apane jajbaat par kaabo paane kii koshish kii
 After the film was over, i grabbed the hands of Raju (director Raju Hirani) and Vinod (producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra) and started crying
 'haath par likh kar sanju ke dialog yaad karte the ranbir! aise bane munna bhaito sanjay dutt jaise khud hai kya ranbir usase aadha bhi acha bhi kar paae? is sawaal ke jawaab main sanjay dutt ne kaha, 'wo kahin-kahin zyada behatar hai
 The way he engraved the character proves that Ranbir is a very good actor
 'sanjay dutt ne yuva varg ko bhi khaas naseehat di
 Sanjay Dutt, who was himself a victim of drug addiction, said, 'stay high on life, work and gym, not on drugs

 He said that the massacre of soldiers in Pulwama was due to a government order in 2014
 unhone twit karte hue likhaa ki pehle sarkaar ne ek aadesh diya tha ki kisi bhi vaahan ko kisi bhi check point par roka nahin jaae
 The order came because some army personnel opened fire on a Maruti car
 iske baad javaanon par mukadmaa bhi chalaa tha or aaj bhi ve jail main hai
 Explain that on November 3, 2014, 53 personnel of Rashtriya Rifles fired on a white Maruti car in Budgam

 vitt mantri ne kaha ki bharat kii kootnithik pahal kaa asar tha ki duniya ke kai desh is prayaas main tha
 China used to impose technical objection, after India's pressure and efforts it also lifted the ban
 unhone kaha ki rashtrawaad hamaare liye ahm mudda tha or hameshaa rahegaa
 Jaitley said that it is a shame that nationalism is not an issue for Congress

" hamaare swaagat ke liye ham bharat sarkaar or sthaneey prashasan ko dhanyavad dete hai
 These mps also said that their visit was viewed from a wrong perspective
 wo to yahaan tathy jutaney aae hai
 He said that we have nothing to do with politics
 in saansadon ne dakshinpanthi vichaardhaara ke hone ke vipaksh ke hamalon par kaha ki wo fasivadi nahin hai
 If there were fascists, the public would not have chosen them
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki aatankwaad se kisi desh ko tabah nahin hone de sakate
 It is not clear what media group was called in this press conference, but local newspapers and journalists were not called for this press conference
 news agency ANI se ek saansad ne kaha ki agar unhen yahaan aane kii ijaajat he to vipakshi saasandon ko bhi milani chahie
 These mps were taken from Srinagar Airport to a luxury hotel in the city in bullet-proof vehicles
 vahiin suraksha kaa kafila bhi inke saath chal rahaa tha
 Most of these mps belong to the right-wing parties
 27 main se keval teen saansad left yaa libral party se hai

 a post shared by Nirahua (@dineshlalyadav) on Jun 6, 2018 at 11:33 pm PDT baadh kii vibheeshikaa se bihar ke kai jilon me trahimam machaa he
 But there are politicians in Bihar that doing politics in the name of flood does not halt
 satta paksh kaa aarope kii centre sarkaar bihar main ai traasadee ko nazarandaaj kar rahi he, to vipaksh kaa aarope he ki bihar sarkaar baadh peediton ko raahat pahunchane main vifal rahi he
 But amidst all these allegations and counter-allegations, it remains a matter of discussion that the Union ministers go to relief camps and eat food and get a picture in the media
 sattarudh dal jediu ne raahat shiviron main kendriya mantriyon ke bhojan karne ko besharmi kii seemaa paar karne kii sangya di to bijepi ne kendriya mantriyon ke bachaav main kaha ki jediu ab shishtachar bhi bhul gai he
 Many Union ministers are visiting flood affected areas in Bihar
 kai ne torahat shivionmen bhojan bhi kiya
 What was the purpose of taking food in relief camps, that is what is known, but JDU has attacked it strongly
 jediu ne kendriya mantriyon par waar karte hue kaha ki baadh peediton ko abhi tak kendra sarkaar kii ore se raahat ke naam par ek paisa nahin mila he lekin raahat shiviron main bhojan karte hue unhen shame bhi nahin aati
 JDU said that this is the culmination of shamelessness
 baadh peediton kaa gussa hua kamakendriya mantriyon par bayanon ke tir chale or bijepi chup rahe ye kaise ho saktaa he
 BJP in defense of its central ministers said JDU has now forgotten courtesy too
 baadh peedit ilaakon kaa daura karne ke dauraan kendriya mantriyon ne raahat shiviron main bhojan kar puri vyavastha ke prati sammaan kaa bhav dikhaaya
 There should not be politics on such an occasion
 jediu kaa is tarah kaa bayaan hataasha ko darshata he
 The BJP said that the anger of the flood victims towards the administration was lessened by the food of the Union ministers going to the relief camps
 media main chaane kaa stantisse pehle somvaar ko do din ke baadh peedit ilaakon kaa daura kar lautne parmukhyamantri nitish kumaarane bhi kendriya mantriyon par jamkar hamalaa bolaa tha
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had said directly that the Union ministers had nothing to do with the floods in Bihar
 ve to sirf isliye bihar in dinon aa rahe hai ki media main unako jagah mil jaae or bihar kii janata ye na puche ki jab bihar main baadh ai thi to wo kahaan the
 Demand for flood relief package JDU has again attacked the central government
 jediu ne kaha ki agar baahar ke liye baadh raahat package kii ghoshnaa nahin kii gai to jediu dilli jaakar pradhanmantri awaas kaa gheraav karegi
 JDU spokesperson Sanjay Singh said in a strong tone that the Union Minister is going to the relief camps and having food and putting his pictures on social media only to show them off
 kendriya mantriyon ko bihar kii janata ke dard kaa khyaal nahin he
 They will no longer be allowed to enter Bihar
