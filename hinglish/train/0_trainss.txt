 PM Modi has once again castigated Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday
 unhone (PM Modi) ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki congress party ne mere liye apni lav dikshnir se jaise shabd nikle jisaki koi kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa he
 How many times these people have reprimanded me by abusing me, this is also shown by their love dictionary
 piem (PM Modi) ne kaha ki in logon ne mujhe javaanon ke khun kaa dalal bataaya, itnaa hi nahin inhone apni prem kii dictionari se mere liye gaddaphi, musolini, hitler jaise shabd chalate hi rahete hai
 Significantly, this is not the first time that PM Modi has attacked the Congress party or Rahul Gandhi
 isse pehle buudhvaar ko hipiem modi (PM Modi)ne haryana ke fatehabad main ek jansabha ke dauranpriyanka gandhi (priyanka Gandhi)ke pati robert wadra (robert Vadra) or congress par nishaanaa saadhaa
 PM Modi (PM Modi) said in gestures that this watchman has taken the farmers to the court
 aaj vah jamaanat ke liye chakkar kaat rahe hai, idi ke daftar main juute ghis rahe hai
 These people previously believed that we are the emperor
 main aise logon ko jail ke daravaaje tak le gaya hum, aane vaale paanch saal main inhen andar tak kar duungaa
 During the public meeting, PM Modi also attacked the Congress
 piem modi (PM Modi) ne kaha ki bharat mata kii jai bolne par aitraaj jataane vaali congress ab deshadroh kaa kanoon hataane kii bhi baat kah rahi he
 He said that the Congress is saying that if its government is formed in Delhi, its special rights will be taken away from the soldiers stationed there in the violence areas, including Jammu and Kashmir
 yani jo patharbaj he, jo aatankwaad ke samarthak hai, unako khuli chhot dene kaa saarvajanik rup se bol rahi he
 PM Modi said that the Congress had promised you that it will implement One Rank One Pension
 ye vaada karte-karte usne chaar dashak nikaal die
 When you put pressure, in 2013-14, by placing just 500 crores before the election, Congress lied that One Rank One Pension has been implemented
 ye aapse kitna bada dhokhaa tha
 PM Modi said during the public meeting that the BJP government is dedicated to respecting the young and the farmer
 kisaanon ke haq ke liye awaz uthaane vaale, bharat kii krishi niti par apni chhap chhodane vaale ‘sar choturam' ji kii bhavy pratimaa kaa anaavaran karne kaa saubhaahgya mujhe kuch maheene pehle hi mila tha
 At the same time, he said that Congress has never been concerned about the honor of the soldiers nor the respect of the farmers
 inhone to kisaanon kii jameen par bhi bhrashtachar kii kheti hi kii he
 When the Congress government was in Haryana and Delhi, then how the game of land grabbing of farmers was played at the cost of the money, you all know
 piem modi ne kaha ki ek taraf kisaanon ke hiton ke liye jahaan ham puri eemaandaaree se kaam kar rahe hai, vahiin congress ne jhooth or dhokhe kii niti apana rakhi he
 In the name of debt waiver, how he has cheated farmers in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, now it is being discussed everywhere
 jharkhand main singhbhum or jamshedpur loksabhaa siton (lok Sabha Election 2019) ke liye chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki, 'congress ko chunauti detaa hum, namdaar parivaar ke ragadarbariyon or chele chapatton ko chunauti detaa hum ki aaj kaa charan to puraa ho gaya he, lekin abhi do charnon kaa chunaav shesh he
 Fight the last two phases on the honor of your former Prime Minister for whom you are shedding thick tears
 ' piem modi ne congress or uske sahyogiyon ko lalkaarte hue kaha tha ki aap main himmat he to aakhri do charnon ke chunaav or dilli kaa bhi chunaav, boforce ke mudde par lard len
 He had said that the Namdar family also forgot the status of the Prime Minister's post and continued to abuse the Prime Minister of the country, but as soon as in a recent meeting i reminded him of the corruption of Bofors, as the storm came
 maine to sirf ek shabd hi bolaa tha, lekin maano inako to bichchhu kaat gaya
 He said that the youth of the country should also know how a family looted and ruined the country in the 20th century
 unhone kaha tha ki aaiye us samay ke pradhanmantri (rajeev gandhi) ke maan sammaan ke mudde par hi shesh chunaav ladate hai
 Come to the ground if you have the courage
 ''modi ne do took kaha, 'yah loktantr he, aap apni baat rakhiye or ham apni baat rakhenge
 The public will decide Janardan
 ' unhone kaha tha ki main dekhtaa hum ki ye milavati log or congress meri chunauti ko sweekaar karte hai ki nahin?' pradhanmantri ne congress par apane shashan ke pachpan varshon main baari bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha tha ki vah is bhrashtachar kii jakadan ko todane main kaaphi had tak safal hue hai, lekin vah yah daawa nahin kar sakate ki is jakadan ko unhone puri tarah samaapt kar diya he

 com / lxst7kzj69 The country's budget is to be presented on February 1
 thik usee din se puure bihar main block vikaas adhikariyon ne bemiyadi hadtaal par jane kaa faisla kiya he
 The possibility of stalling work on all the blocks of the state is being expressed due to the officials going on strike in this way
 block vikaas adhikariyon ke pradesh adhyaksh prashanth kumaar ne somvaar ko press conference ke jariye yah jaankaree di
 According to Prashant Kumar, for the past several years, we have been putting our demands before the government, but we have only got assurance
 isliye aaj sabhi block vikaas adhikariyon nepatnamein baithak kii
 In this meeting, everyone decided with Ekrai that now there is no other way left before us to go on strike
 pradesh block vikaas adhikari ne rajya sarkaar par aarope lagaate hue kaha kibihar sarkaaraki manshaa block vikaas adhikariyon ke sanghathan ko kamjor banaae rakhane kii lag rahi he
 The Rural Development Association has been continuously demanding from the state government about the Bihar Rural Development Services Restructuring and the improvement in salary discrepancy
 apni maangon ko lekar gramin vikaas sangh ne vibhaag ke sachiv ke saath baatcheet kii or vetan visangati ko dur karne kii maang kii, lekin aashwaasan ke baavjood sarkaar ne ab tak koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 In such a situation, we were forced to take a tough decision
 pradesh block vikaas adhikari ne bataaya ki bihar ke sabhi block vikaas adhikari 1 farvari se bemiyadi hadtaal par chale jaaenge
 At the same time, he said that due to this, the government work in the whole of Bihar will be stopped
 agar yah hadtaal lambey vakt tak jari rahi to aanevaale chunaav ke kaamkajpar bhi iskaa asar dekhne ko mil saktaa he

 Taking lessons from the Karnataka assembly elections, the opposition parties have become alert to stop the bjp's victory chariot in the upcoming assembly elections and Lok Sabha elections
 karnataka chunaav main congress or jedies ke alag-alag chunaav ladane kii vajah se bijepi sabase badi party banakar ubhari
 However, eight seats remained away from the majority, due to which the Yeddyurappa government of Karnataka fell and the bjp's gate in the south was closed once again
 abakarnatakamein jedies ke kumaraswami congress ke samarthan se sarkaar banane ja rahe hai
 On Wednesday, he will take oath as Chief Minister
 karnataka main jedies or congress ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa tha, lekin chunaav ke baad bijepi ko sarkaar banane se rokane ke liye congress ne jedies ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kar diya
 It is believed that if the Congress and JDS had contested the elections together, they could have got more seats on their account
 itnaa hi nahin, agar donon dal milakar saal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main utarate hai, to phir karnataka main bijepi ke liye saal 2014 ke chunavi nattejey ko doharaana mushkil ho saktaa he
 Compared to the results of the assembly elections, in the Lok Sabha elections, the congress-jds will hold 22 of the 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 bijepi ke khilaaf padane vaale voton ko bantane se rokane ko ranneetiwahin, karnataka chunaav nateezon se sabak lete hue ab vipakshi partiyaan saal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke khilaaf padane vaale voton ko vibhajit hone se rokane kii nai ranneeti taiyaar karne main jute gai hai
 Opposition parties like Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Congress argue that it was only the division of anti-bjp votes that led to BJP becoming the largest party in Karnataka
 bijepi ke khilaaf ekajutata se banegi batsapa pravaktaa rajendra choudhary kaa kahana he ki aagaamee chunaavon main ek aisi ranneeti taiyaar karne kii jarurat he, jo yah sunishchit kare ki bijepi virdohi vot bante nahin
 BJP will not get any benefit from this
 ab chunaavon ko ranneetik tareeke se ladane kii jarurat he
 He said that this success can be achieved by solidarity, whose example was seen in Phulpur and Gorakhpur
 in donon jagahon par sapa ne basapa kii madad se bijepi ko shikast di
 In this case, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) spokesperson Anil Dubey said that all parties with similar views should come on one platform to stop the BJP
 lakhanu uniwarsity ke raajnneeti vigyaan vibhaag ke purv pramukh or raajnneetik vishleshak ramesh dikshit kaa kahana he ki karnataka chunaav se yah sabak siikhnaa hoga ki sirf ek ekajute vipaksh hi bijepi ko roak saktaa he or pichley aankade is baat ko sabit karte hai
 In order to prevent the Congress from repeating the mistake of Karnataka in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the Congress will have to avoid repeating the mistakes made during the Karnataka elections so that there is no rift in the opposition unity
 agar congress ne galati doharaai, to iskaa sidhaa phayda bijepi ko milegaa
 BSP supremo Mayawati also says that the Congress should not repeat the mistake it made during campaigning in Muslim-dominated areas, where it described the Janata Dal (secular) as the bjp's 'b-team'
 unhone kaha, ''meraa congress ko suzav he ki wo is tarah kii bhashaa kaa istemaal bhavishya main na kare, jo aagaamee chunaavon main bijepi or aresas kii madad kar sakate hai
 Screw on pm's post in opposition parties: Screw can be stuck between the opposition parties, who are getting united to defeat BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 sabhi dal abhi tak rahul gandhi ko piem pad ke liye daavedaar nahin maan rahe hai
 In this case, former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav says that it will decide the time for the Congress President to become Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki congress ke saath samaajawaadee party kii dosti 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav tak jari rahegi
 On the developments in Karnataka, Akhilesh said that due to the Supreme Court, democracy has survived in the country
 rahul dravid ke shandaar antarrashtriya karier kaa ant shaayad ho gaya ho kyonki yah anbhavi ballebaaj jald hi sanyas kii ghoshnaa kar saktaa he
 The 39-year-old Dravid is believed to have told some teammates that he had made up his mind to say goodbye after another failure in the final Test against Australia here on Friday
 haalanki unase sampark nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Rahul was out for 25 on Friday

 unhone 36 test shatak banaaye hai jisamen unka sarvaadhik score 270 ran kaa he
 Desperate to eliminate the 'chokers' tag, the South African cricket team will take on a weak team like Zimbabwe on Thursday in their first match of the T20 World Cup
 group si ke is bemail mukaable main dakshin africa ke liye chunauti katai mushkil nahin he
 Zimbabwe, on the other hand, lost to Sri Lanka in the first match
 isisi ke toornamenton main khitaabi jeet se ab tak maharoom dakshin africa dabaav ke aage ghutane techne vaale ‘chokars’ ke rup main badnaam he
 For him, however, this match is grossly mismatched
 har vibhaag main dakshin africa team zimbabwe par baari he
 On the other hand, chasing the target of 182 against Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe were reduced to 100 runs
 chaar ballebaaj to khaataa bhi nahin khol sake jabaki do ne doharaa ank nahin chuaa
 Captain Brendan Taylor, however, said that his team is far better than this score
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaari team kaaphi behatar he
 Not the same as the score from the first match
 hamane kaaphi mehnat kii he
 'zimbabwe's bowling was also average and six bowlers could take just one wicket
 dakshin africa team ko dabaav jhelane kii kshamta behatar banani hogi
 Batsman JP Duminy said, 'we could not do well in many ICC tournaments but this time it will wash away the stigma
 ’newjiland ke khilaaf abhyaas match main dakshin africa ne acha pradarshan kiya
 Almost all his major batsmen scored
 bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne 40 saal baad bansagar pariyojna ke puraa hone par pradhanmantri ko dhanyavad diya
 Also, he tweeted that if the Congress had wanted, the farmers would have benefited 20 years ago
 unhone kaha, 'pradhanmantri narendra modi ne purvi uttar pradesh ke mirzapur main 3148
 Launched the Bansagar project at a cost of Rs 91 crore, which will provide irrigation facilities to farmers in a dozen districts including Rohtas, Buxar Bhojpur, Bhabua, Gaya and Patna in Bihar

 mangalvaar ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii maujuudagi main hardik patel congress main shaamil honge, vah jamnagar loksabhaa seat se chunaav lard sakate hai
 The hardik-alpesh-jignesh trio that emerged during the 2017 Gujarat Assembly elections had raised the odds of the Bharatiya Janata Party, all three campaigning against the BJP across the state, which also benefited the Congress

 apni hi party ke netaa ke saath baatcheet kii audio clip ko lekar vivaadon main ghire madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko clin chit mil gai he
 In an audio clip leaked on social media two days ago, Chauhan is assuring BJP leader Rajendra Chaudhary of honoring him after the election in favor of supporting the party's candidate in the Mandsaur's Garoth assembly by-election

 However, on giving clean chit to Chauhan, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh said that so far the Central Election Commission has not issued any such order, BJP leaders are falsely campaigning for giving clean chit

 Today is Monday and people will leave their work again today after spending weekly leave
 weekend yani ravivaar (sande) aane se pehle hi har kisi ko chuttee kaa ahsaas hone lagata he lekin kabhi sochaa he ki hamaare desh main chuttee kii shuruyaat kab se hui
 There was a time when the workers did not get weekly off and people were forced to work seven days a week, but 129 years ago we got our lovely Sunday to celebrate the holiday
 saptahik avkaash hasil karne ke liye desh main lanbaa andolan chalaa or isaki shuruyaat kii thi majdoor netaa narayan meghaji lokhande ne
 Lokhande waged a long struggle and campaigned against the British for a weekly holiday
 yah unheen ke andolan kaa hi prayaas tha ki angrej hukumat ne 1890 main 10 june ko aam bharatiyon ke liye ravivaar ke din ko saptahik avkaash ke liye chun liya or apni manyata di
 Earlier there was no leave, a large number of Indian laborers worked in textile and many other mills in the British Raj
 unhen hafte ke sabhi saaton din kaam karnaa hota tha or unke liye chuttee kii koi vyavastha nahin thi
 Labor leader Narayan Meghaji Lokhande started his campaign for a day's leave to the mill workers
 saptahik avkaash ke liye lokhande ne angrej shaskaon ke saamne prastaav pesh kiya, lekin use thukraa diya gaya
 After this, Lokhande had to struggle long to achieve his goal
 kareeb 7 saal ke sangharsh ke baad angrej hukumat ko apana faisla badalanaa padaa or sabhi bharatiyon ke liye ravivaar ke din ko saptahik avkaash ke rup main manyata de di
 It is not that before that there was no system of weekly holiday on Sunday in the country
 is faisle se pehle sirf sarkari karmchaariyon ko hi ravivaar ke rup main saptahik chuttee milti thi
 Even the early lunch break, labor leader Narayan Meghaji Lokhande not only provided weekly holiday for Indians but on the basis of his efforts, he was given a chance to rest for half an hour in the afternoon, which later became a lunch break
 khaas baat yah he ki vaishvik str par ravivaar ke din ko avkaash ke rup main dene kii shuruyaat isliye hui kyonki isai samaaj ke logon ke liye ravivaar kaa din prarthana karne kaa hota he or girjaghar main jaakar prarthana karte the
 In view of this, Sunday was declared as a weekly holiday

 - input IANS The fire of unrest between the contract workers at Maruti Suzuki's Manesar plant (haryana) was abruptly turned into violence and arson on 18 July
 is ghatana main ek echaar akjicutive kii maut ho gai or 96 karmchaaree ghayal ho gaye the
 Soon after resuming operations at the closed plant on August 21, Suzuki Motor Corp Chairman Osamu Suzuki visited India for a week and met all the injured employees besides visiting the Manesar plant
 bharat kii number ek car nirmaataa company ko shramik asantosh ke alaava or bhi kai samasyaon se jujhna pad rahaa he
 During April to July this year, Maruti's share in the domestic passenger vehicle market declined to 38
 6 fisadi rah gai he
 55 in 2000
 5 fisadi thi
 Maruti's financial data is also not looking good
 india today samooh ke editor-in-chif arun puri or bijness today ke editor chaitanya kalbag ke saath nai dilli sthit ek hotel ke kamare main vishesh intervyuu ke dauraan half shart pahane 82 varshiya sujuki shant or sahaj dikh rahe the
 During this time he gave many amazing figures and details
 pesh hai is intervyuu ke kuch ansh:manesar kii ashaanti par
 This problem has staked Suzuki Motor Corp's worldwide credibility and tarnished Maruti Suzuki's image in India
 yah ghatana 18 july ko hui, ise ek maheene se zyada vakt ho chukaa he
 Many people have been arrested in connection with this violent incident, but i do not believe that the reason for this incident is not clear yet
 aisi afvaahen thim ki in logon (hamalaavaron) ko hafte yaa das din ke liye jail main daalaa jayega or phir ve reeha ho jaaenge, iske baad ve hero yaa star jaise ho jaaenge
 Such was his thinking
 hinsa main lipt sabhi logon (aise 546 log the) kii pahchaan kar lee gai he or unako naukari se nikaal diya gaya he
 Certainly they were seeking money from Maruti Suzuki, but we decided that we would not give them even one rupee
 meraa maananaa he ki union (maaruti) is vivaad ke maamle main jis tarah se management se pesh aayaa he vah puri tarah se sahi nahin he
 i do not consider it a union-management labor problem, i consider it a criminal act and it has shocked me
 1945 se 1960 tak hamane bhi shramik samasyaon kaa saamana kiya
 i have experience (in Japan) of dealing with labor problems
 har desh ko kabhi na kabhi shramik samasya kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Has Manesar changed his or other Japanese investors' attitudes towards India? There is no change in my thinking
 maaruti sujuki kii sthapana kiye hue hamen 30 saal ho gaye hai
 i was born and raised in Japan, but consider India as my second home
 shrimati indira gandhi chaahati thim ki yahaan choti kaaron kaa utpaadan ho, hamaare vichaar mil rahe the
 i consider Maruti a part of the Suzuki family
 main gujarat ke mukhyamantri (narendra modi) se mila or haryana ke mukhyamantri (bhupinder singh hooda) se bhi mila
 i have clearly told both the people that Haryana is my first house and Gujarat second
 (maaruti kii gujarat main 2015-16 tak 700 acre jameen par salanaa 2,50,000 utpaadan kshamta kaa car plant sthapit karne kii yojana he)maaruti sujuki apane sabhi plant main contract varkar kii vyavastha khatm kar degi?nahin, aisa nahin hoga
 We also have contract workers in Japan
 vahaan sthaayee karmchaariyon kaa anupaat 65 se 70 fisadi or contract varkar kaa anupaat 30 se 35 fisadi he
 Suzuki Motor directly examines and investigates all employees who come through the contractor in Japan
 hamen vahaan karmchaariyon kaa puraa itihaas or unke pehle ke kaamkaaj kii jaankaree hoti he
 We know his educational qualifications, his career history, his home address, name
 lekin yahaan thekedaar jise bhi lekar aate hai vah bina kisi shart ke kaam kar rahaa he
 In our factories in Thailand and Indonesia, contract workers are required to sign an affidavit that they will be thrown out if they do not work properly or break company rules
 isliye mujhe lagata he ki hamen aisi vyavasthaaon ko kathorta se lagu karnaa hoga
 In India, the ratio between the contract worker and the regular worker is 50:50
 japan main yah anupaat 30:70 kaa he
 So here we want to change this ratio to that of Japan
 maaruti sujuki kii desh ke bazaar main ghatati hissedari par
 Yes, i am worried about market share
 lekin uttar america yaa europe main kisi bhi ek car utpaadak kii hissedari 55 fisadi, 50 fisadi yaa 40 fisadi bhi nahin he
 
 
 It is impossible there
 bharat main kam-se-kam 20 global car nirmaataa maujuud hai
 But first, Maruti Suzuki Motor had made inroads into the Indian market, so we will make every effort to maintain a 40 per cent market share
 kya maaruti sujuki bharat ke dijal car bazaar ko thik se nahin samaj pai or usne isamen kaaphi der se pravesh kiya he?sujuki ke paas choti kaaren hai
 We have small cars in the a and b segments
 lekin si yaa di segment, yaa esayuvi segment main kaaren nahin hai
 If we want to maintain our market share, we will definitely have to keep the full range
 pichley 30 saal main (jab se bharat main maaruti shuru hui he) kareeb 20 saal tak 80 se 90 fisadi hissaa choti kaaron kaa rahaa he
 The proportion of customers who can buy big cars has increased due to increase in income of people in India
 arthvyavastha tarakkee karti he or log choti kaaron se badi kaaron kii taraf badaae lagate hai
 You rightly said that Maruti Suzuki was not producing diesel cars
 isliye dijal bazaar main hamaare utarane main deree hui
 Petrol cars were pushed forward instead of diesel in view of price policies
 ham petrol or dijal kii keemton main antar kii sarkari niti ko samaj nahin paae ki ek samay baad dijal kii keemat badhegi or yah antar kam hoga
 On Maruti Suzuki's declining profit margin (maruti Suzuki contributes up to 30 per cent of Suzuki Motor's tax profits)
 isamen roylty kaa bhi masalaa he or exange rate kii bhi samasya he
 Take the example of Fiat diesel engine, Japan's Suzuki (suzuki Motor) adopted this technology and later we handed it over to Maruti
 to ab japan sujuki iske liye phiet ko roylty de rahi he or maaruti esemasi, japan ko roylty de rahi he
 
 
 Another big issue is the exchange rate
 bees saal pehle yah donon ke liye phaayde vaali baat thi
 But if i only look at the situation of 20 years ago, it will not be right because i see in perfection
 to 20 saal pehle kii tarah jab japan sujuki ne maaruti main 30 fisadi se zyada kaa nivesh kiya tha
 
 
 This point still cannot be ignored
 koun-si cheez unhen aage badha rahi he?kaam, kaam, kaam
 
 
 (laughs) Manesar three hours from the hotel
 
 
 iske baad chaar ghante plant ke chakkar lagaana, phir teen ghante hotel waapas aane main
 
 
 i have made several suggestions to reduce costs during the audit of the plant
 kya bharat kaarobaar karne ke lihaaj se sabase kathin deshon main se he
 (laughs) No comment

 The Human Rights Commission has said in its report that the violence that erupted in Asansol on March 28 night is a clear example of administrative adversity

 haalanki jab unase poocha gaya ki bijepi bhi chunaav ke maukey par daliton ko saath jodne main lagi he, to unka jawaab tha ki sangh ke kaam kaa chunaav se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 The bjp's strategy of trying to hoist the saffron flag in the name of Hindutva in the name of Hindutva is to increase the penetration among the Dalits, who are still considered as Bahujan Samaj Party vote banks, and bring them together in the name of Hindutva
 sangh bhi saamaajik samarasata ke naam par yahi karne main laga he
 This effort is being accelerated before the election

 unhone kaha ki afjal guru kaho yaa yaqub menon inako sajaa bharat ke samvidhan or kanoon ke hisaab se mili he
 That is why no one has the right to oppose them

 He said that China probably does not want to show its strength to the people of India and hence is stopping the Mansarovar Yatra by citing security

 Policy makers focused all their attention on increasing production and bringing self-sufficiency and kept moving in this direction
 hindustan ke sabase bade vot bank ko naaraaz karne ke dar se ve koi bhi bada jokhim uthaane se bachate rahe
 In contrast, China initiated major reforms, as a result of which only 18 per cent of its population is dependent on agriculture, while in India, the number of such people is 43 per cent
 hindustan kii ek naadaani yah thi ki vah vibhinn bhu-kanoonon main sanshodhan karne main naakaam rahaa
 As a result, the division of land holdings reached a firm level

 There is a clear need to integrate agriculture with domestic and industrial consumption and diversify the crops according to need

 When the NDA government led by Narendra Modi came to power, it rejuvenated the program
 usne iskaa naam bhi badalakar pradhanmantri awaas yojana rakh diya
 The size of the houses to be built was increased from 20 square meters to 25 square meters and the assistance amount was also increased from Rs 70,000 to 1
 2 lakh rupye kar di
 But the most important thing was that by using digital and communication technology, corruption was curbed
 pehali kist ke bhugtan ke vakt sahaayta rakam hasil karne vaale shaks ko apni tasviir or plot kii tasviir jis par vah makaan banane ja rahaa he, aplod kerani hoti he
 Then the person has to send the pictures of the finished house on each major stage of construction as per the schedule, only then he gets the next installment
 sabsidi kii rakam sidhe us shaks ke bank khate main jamaa kii jaati he jisase use duusare kaam main lagaana bhi mumkin nahin he
 Due to this, corruption at the hands of local officers has come down from 50 per cent to about 12 per cent

 a bad result has also taken place: Panchayat level officials are not enthusiastically pursuing this program because the amount of corruption is not reaching their hands
 ek or swaagatyogy kaam yah hua he ki alahada yojanaon ke tahat milane vaali tamaam sevaaon ko ek saath jod diya gaya he
 Hence, a person who is constructing a house under the housing scheme can also get subsidy for toilets under Swachh Bharat, take a LPG connection under the Prime Minister Ujjwala scheme and an electricity connection under the rural electrification program
 chunki yah sari rakam sidhe bank khate main jaati he, isliye bhrasht afasaron ke liye is bhugtan ko rokane yaa duusari taraf modeye ke maukon main naatakeey kami ai he
 After providing these facilities, it is also important to ensure that there is no compromise with the quality of these services
 gaanv main bijli kaa khambha laga dena hi kaaphi nahin he, usamen bijli kii acchhee supplai bhi honi hi chahie
 The facility of refill in LPG given on subsidy will be provided easily, not on premium

 Ramachandran was the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, he brought the mid-day Meal Scheme
 us vakt maine is patrika ke liye ek lekh likhaa tha or ise loklubhaavan yojana kahkar khaarij kar diya tha
 But its effect eventually proved to be revolutionary
 is yojana ke laae jane ke kuch hi saalon baad rajya main bal mrityu dar main acchhee-khaasi giravat aane lagi
 Then the government cleverly included pregnant mothers in this scheme who used to leave their children to school
 unhen na keval khaane kaa package diya jaataa tha balki garbh kii suraksha ke liye davaaiyaan bhi di jaati thim
 Then they were also given post-natal care and benefits

 But it metamorphosed into providing water in villages where women had to walk for miles to get water

 At that time, the people of the village were ready to gather at hand pumps to fill the water, now they are crying out for arranging the tap directly to supply water to their houses, especially when they have given the people of the cities Have seen using such facility

 The same reasons still persist, due to which people are moving from villages to urban India in search of jobs

 Do you know which is the best camera in the world? Think your answer till then i tell a short story
 mere ek kareebi dost hai - ek bade tivi channel ke mashhoor reporter
 He has such a great passion for photography that he has spent millions of rupees on cameras, lenses, tripods, filters and photography books
 tarah-tarah ke camera-lens kaa jakhira aisa ki puraa camera bag bech den to shaayad ek nayi gaadi aa jaae! mobile phone ke camere se unhen sakht chidh he
 He considers it as 'toy', 'tutpanjia' and 'stigma for photography'
 isliye, wo blueberi kaa aisa phone rakhte hai jisamen camera he hi nahin
 When there was a catastrophe in Kedarnath, he rushed there in a hurry to report
 ab jahaan na sadak thi na gaadi kaa rasta vahaan apana baari bharkam camera bag wo kaise le jate! kedarnath pahunchane ke liye, pahaado ke upar kai dinon ke paidal raste se tivi reporting ke liye jitna saamaan le janaa tha vahi mushkil tha
 Eventually, he reached somehow by betting on his life
 jo reporting maukey se unhone kii, uski to desh-duniya main tarif hui
 But my friends themselves say that they will have a lifetime of regret of not taking any photo of this very dangerous and memorable experience
 
 
 ab to aap samaj gaye na?duniya kaa sabase acha camera vahi he jo jarurat ke vakt aapke paas ho
 And this camera is your mobile phone
 fasebuk par nai profile pikchar lagaani ho yaa kisi yaadgaar lamhe ko doston ke saath share karnaa ho - yahi to wo camera he jo har maukey par aapkaa saath detaa he
 It is true that mobile phone cameras are 'poor' in many cases compared to larger cameras
 lekin ye bhi sach he ki sirf bandook kharid lene se koi nishanebaaj nahin ban jaataa
 Come, know that by taking care of some things, we can take a heart-winning photo even with a mobile camera
 1
 Before Click: Check Camera Settings - Have you ever looked at the settings of your mobile phone camera after turning it on? What kind of treasure is hidden there! Depending on the model of the phone, you will find there shooting modes, effects, timers, ISO, GPS, guidelines
 
 
 aisi tamaam chijen dikhengi
 Instead of getting confused by talking about all the settings, let me tell you just some important things
 'image quality' kii centings main 'superfine' (yaa sabase acha, excilent, yaa 100 percent, jo kuch bhi likhaa ho) use chunie
 After this, go to the resolution and select the highest resolution you can see
 zyada risholshan kaa matlab he kii photo kii file badi banegi or aap isse acha print bhi banavaa sakate hai
 If there is less space in your camera or memory card then reduce the resolution but do not reduce the 'image quality' at all
 phone camere main yadi 'anti shaike mod' he to use on kar len
 Clean the camera lens - Before reading further, look carefully at your mobile phone's camera lens with a slight slant
 dikhe na ungaliyon ke nishaan? phone ke camere ko bachaane ke liye koi lens cover nahin hota
 Therefore, knowingly and unknowingly, your fingers keep on it
 yahi chhipe hue nishaan, dhul or gandagi aapaki photo ke dushman hai jo aapaki photo ko dhundhala kar dete hai
 Wipe the lens with a soft cloth before taking a photo
 chashma saaf karne kaa kapadaa iske liye thik rahegaa
 Walk and get closer - Get as close to what you want to take a photo of
 iske teen phaayde hai
 One, the quality of the photo will be better, second, the unnecessary items will be removed from your frame and thirdly that if the camera is moved while taking the photo, it will have less effect on the photo
 mobile phone ke camere kaa na sirf lens chota hota he balki lite ko photo main badalane vaala sabase jaruri hissaa 'sensor' bhi chota-sa hota he
 The easiest way to deal with this lack of lenses and sensors is to take a photo close by
 lite badhaane kaa intjaam karen-photo, puri tarah 'lite' or 'shadow' kaa hi khel he
 Barring a few expensive mobile phones, the biggest helplessness of most phone cameras is that they are not able to take good pictures in low light
 apane camere kii is majaburi ko samajhen
 Whose photo is to be taken, if possible, bring it in broad daylight
 nahin to khidki-daravaaje kholen, parade hataaen, lite jalaaen
 If good light is arranged, then it is half the work done
 sabase badhiya lite wo he, jo raushnee to acchhee de, lekin ankho ko chubhe nahin
 Like the light of morning and evening, or the light of the sun hidden in the cloud
 sahi bekagranud chune -sahi bekagranud wo he, jisamen aapke asli 'subject' (wo cheez jisaki aap photo le rahe hai) khil kar saamne aae
 The backgroud should never be shiny, flamboyant or so colorful that the real subject is buried against it
 kisi vyakti kii photo khinch rahe hai to phulon kii becoground ke bajaay, tuuti badrang puraani diwaar zyada acchhee rahegi
 Never, there should be more light in the backgroud than the light on your subject
 bekagranud kii lite yaa to subject se kam honi chahie yaa phir utani hi
 Fix White Balance - Correcting white balance means that the light is of any color, everything in the photo should be seen in natural color
 yani agar photo balb kii pili raushnee main lee gai ho to bhi, pattey hare dikhen or safed shart safed
 If you do not want to get too upset, then turn the white balance to 'auto Mode'
 phir jis cheez kii photo khinchni ho us par focus karke, camere ko teen-chaar second edjust hone kaa mauka den
 You will see that the tone of the photo changed
 agar aap advance yujar hai, to lite ke hisaab se white balance ke duusare mods ko chune
 Forget the special effects - in camera settings, you may see various types of opus that tempt you
 'blike and white', 'sipia tone', 'cartoon effect', 'toy camera effect', 'negative effect' or jane kya-kya
 But my advice is that if you do not use any of these, then you will be benefited
 vajah bilkul saaf he
 If you have taken a simple, photo without any effect, then during the later processing, you can easily create the desired effect
 rangeen photo ko, baad main blike and white bananaa baane haath kaa khel he
 But if you have taken a photo by choosing the black and white mode in the camera itself, then it will be very difficult to make it colorful later
 2
 At the time of click: Horizontal or Vertical - First of all, decide what is the 'main subject' in your photo
 kisi bhi photo main, yahaan tak sinari main bhi, dikhne vaali har cheez 'subject' nahin hoti
 'subject' is something that you want to highlight completely
 asal subject kya he ye faisla kar lene ke baad ye sochen kii usko hilite karne ke liye phone ko horigental (chaudaai main) rakhana thik hoga yaa phir sidhaa yani vertical
 If possible, try to hold the phone both ways
 zyaadaatar photo horigental mod main achche lagate hai or ise computer par screen sever bananaa aasaan hota he
 But profile photos look beautiful in vertical mode
 phone sidhaa ho yaa horigental, is baat kaa khaas dhyaan rahen ki camera sidhaa ho, kisi taraf jhukaa hua nahin
 Forget zoom - You will see an option to zoom as soon as you turn on the phone camera
 zyaadaatar tach screen phone main camera on karne ke baad aap screen par do ungaliyon se pinch karke (yani chutki se) juum karke, subject ko paas laa sakate hai
 But never use zoom in the phone's camera
 kuch khaas manhage phone ko chhod den, to adhiktar phone main optical juum nahin hota
 And digital zoom ruins photos
 asal main digital juum, logon ko lubhaane ke liye marketing ke ek nuskhe ke alaava kuch nahin he
 Save direct light on the lens - remember what happens when the headlight of the car hits your eyes
 ankhe is tarah se chaundhiya jaati hai ki kuch dikhaai nahin detaa
 The same is true of camera lenses
 isliye photo lete samay, kisi tej lite kii dhar ko sidhe camere kii lens par nahin padane den
 On the side from which the light is coming, on that side, you stand with your phone so that the direct light falls on your subject and not your phone camera lens
 freming hi he sab kuch -freming kaa matlab he - photo main kya cheez rakhi jaae, kahaan par rakhi jaae or kis cheez ko hataane kii koshish kii jaae
 For this, move the phone up and down, see where the most beautiful frame is made
 ye ekadam jaruri nahin he ki aap jisaki photo le rahe hai wo frem ke bilkul bichon-bich dikhe
 Putting the subject right in the middle often makes the photo boring
 head room (sir ke upar chodi jane vaali khaali jagah), luk room (insaan jis taraf dekh rahaa ho uske aage zyada jagah chode) kaa khyaal rakhen
 Do read about 'rule of One Third' and apply it
 photography kaa ye sabase jaruri niyam kahata he ki apane frem ko teen hisson main baant kar dekhen - do hisse main aapkaa main subject hona chahie or tisare hisse ko bekagranud ke taur par istemaal karen
 If your camera has Grid Lines or Guidelines in its settings, keep it on
 freming main isse kaaphi madad milegi
 The flash is a double-edged sword - the light from the small LED flash of the mobile phone comes out like a bullet and hits the front
 isse photo kaa natural feel gaayab ho jaataa he or ek hissaa zyada brit dikhne lagata he
 The direct sharp light of the flash also means that it can create a shadowy shadow, which spoils the fun of the photo
 agar lite kam ho or raushnee kaa koi or intjaam nahin ho, to flash istemaal karnaa aapaki majaburi he
 But without flash, keep one or two photos
 flash kii tikhi raushnee ko soft karne ke liye chahen to iske aage ek patala safed kaagaj yaa safed tepe lagaakar bhi dekh sakate hai
 You will feel nauseous, but if you are taking photos in bright sunlight or high light, then use Falsh
 ye shadow ko kam karne main aapaki madad kar saktaa he
 Shake the phone, the photo is useless - everyone knows this, but still the phone shakes while clicking
 phone ko hameshaa donon haathon se pakaden or clic ke liye anguuthe kaa istemaal karen
 If the phone is small, then hold the hand in the phone under the wrist with the other hand - like holding a revolver while firing
 kohni tak apane haathon ko seene se sata len or clic karte samay pal bhar ko saans roak len
 It is best if you can stick around with something, or you can rest your hand
 jis cheez kii photo le rahen hon, wo bhi na hile to bahut hi acha
 Take care of shutter-lag - An incurable disease of digital cameras is called 'shutter-lag'
 jab aap clic karte hai - photo asal main uske kuch der baad khinchati he
 The distance between clicking and actually being photographed is called shutter lag
 achche camaron main shater lag kam yaa nahin ke baraabar hota he jabaki saste phone or digital camaron main aap ise saaf mahasoos kar sakate hai
 To stop the shutter lag game, click a moment before the actual opportunity
 or clic karne ke baad ek-do second phone ko bina hilaae usee pojishan main rakhen
 Change your angle a little and take three to four photos so that you can choose the best one later
 3
 After the click: If possible, transfer the photo to the computer - on the big screen, you will see many such things in the photo that are not properly detected on the small screen of the phone
 cabel kii jhanjhat ke bina phota computer par bhejne ke liye bluetooth kaa istemaal karen
 Easier than that, upload the photo to a cloud service - like Dropbox, Picasa or Google Plus and download it to the computer
 computer par photo ko dekhne kaa baad acchhee photo ko rakhkar baaki ko dilit kar den
 Now it is time to make the photo shine - to make the photo beautiful, there are all free software of enditing to add new life to it
 adhiktar logon kaa kaam 'pikassa' yaa 'google plus' ke editing software se bakhubi chal jayega
 Crop the first picture to remove the excess
 phir rang, tone or lite ko manamafik karen
 Special effects, such as black and white, if you want to do sepia, there is a lot of it within these software
 phone ke bheetar bhi ho sakati hai editing -photo ko conmpooter par bhejnaa agar aapako jhanjhat kaa kaam lagata he to phone ke liye bhi tamaam photo editing eps muft uplabdh hai
 Pixlr Express and Pics Art - Photo Studio are great for adding life to photos
 inamen se kisi ko downlod kar len or apni photo se, jitani chaahe kalakaari karen
 Try as many special effects on the photo as you want
 lekin apni original photo ko hameshaa bachaa kar rakhen
 Just now, share the photo wherever you want and say gracefully - Look at the photo, don't ask the camera! The writer is the senior reporter till date

 Shiv Kumar Sharma 'kakaji', who was the architect of the fiercest farmer movement ever running in many Madhya Pradesh of the country and president of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, was once the state president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union of RSS
 lekin ab puri tarah sarkaar ke khilaaf khadey sharma ne kisaan andolan par khulkar baatcheet kii
 Excerpts: Question: The farmers' movement is now watching the whole country, but what is the real reason for this movement? Answer: The farmers are not troubled today, they have been looted continuously in the 13 years of power of Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 kisaanon ne is saal daal kaa banpar utpaadan kiya lekin unki fasal nunatam samarthan mulya se bhi aadhe daam par bik rahi he
 It is the responsibility of the government to buy crops on the MSP, but the government kept sitting silently
 sawaal: aap 13 saal se kisaanon ke thage jane kii baat kah rahe hai, jabaki pradesh ko to krishi vikaas kaa model mana jaataa he?jawaab: yah jhuthe aankadon kaa vikaas he
 BJP and Shivraj are enemies of farmers
 pradesh main gehun utpaadan main tej vikaas kii kahani juthi he
 What happens is that the BJP leader is the only one to be released for the ration of Rs
 kilo kaa anaaj kharid lete hai or agle satr main ise emspi par bech dete hai
 Recycling of grains is showing increased production
 kisaanon ko shunya byaaj par karj to usase bada jhooth he
 If a farmer does not repay the loan by 15 March, then the loan is increased with increased interest and penalty
 jabaki sabko pataa he ki kisaan 15 march tak paisa kaise chukaayegaa, kyonki uskaa bhugtan hi april ke ant or may main shuru hota he
 Question: What is the reason for the agitation being violent? Answer: The farmers have not turned violent, the government staff deliberately instigates them, so that the farmers have an excuse to shoot sticks
 kisaanon ko unki fasal kaa asli mulya dilaane kii koshish karne kii bajaae shivaraj ne andolan ko kamjor karne kii tikadamen kin
 The government system suppressed the farmers
 or kisaanon kii koi bhi baat sunne se inkaar kar diya
 This violence is not an expression of the frustration of a farmer who has been suffering through a decade of suffering
 lekin ab kisaan chup nahin baithegaa
 We are preparing to give a nationwide form to the movement soon

 BJP government imposed emergency in Kashmir, people of Kashmir want independence- people need to take faith in it- Mumbai edition of Iltijindia Today Conclave 2019 started on Friday
 do din tak chalane vaale is kaarykram main kendriya mantri nitin gadakari, air chif marshall bies dhanoa, karan johar, iltijaa mufti jaisi hastiyon ne shirkat kii
 Iltija Mufti, the daughter of former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, called 'the Sound of Silence: How can hearts be won in Kashmir?' In the session, India Today Consulting Editor Rajdeep Sardesai answered the questions flawlessly
 rajdeep saradesai ne iltijaa se kashmir or anuchhed 370 ko lekar kai sawaal puche
 Iltija answered all questions with impunity
 anuchhed 370 hataane ke mudde par iltijaa mufti ne kaha, 'sarkaar kaa tarika bilkul galat he
 This process is completely unconstitutional
 itnaa bada faisla liya gaya lekin kashmiriyon kii raay nahin lee gai
 When Kashmir was the main season of tourism, tourists were suddenly called back
 baari sankhya main sena ke javaanon ko tainaat kiya gaya
 We felt that Pakistan was about to attack
 shaayad isliye aisi taiyaari ho rahi he
 But suddenly it was decided to remove Article 370
 'iltijaa ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 hataane ko lekar bolaa gaya ki isse kashmir kaa vikaas hoga
 This is wrong, it has nothing to do with the development of Kashmir
 desh main mandi he
 The growth rate is falling
 in muddon ko dabaane ke liye hi anuchhed 370 hataane jaisi karrwai kii gai he
 Iltija also questioned the media and said that the media was not showing the ground report of Kashmir
 iltijaa mufti kii maa mahabuuba mufti ko hiraasat main rakhe jane ke sawaal par unhone kaha, 'iskaa kaaran bataaya gaya ki ehtiyaat ke taur par unhen hiraasat main liya gaya taaki sthiti kharaab nahin ho
 i ask if there are so many incidents of mob lynching in the country, has anyone been detained as a precaution
 'iltijaa ne bhavuk hote hue kaha ki kya mujhe meri maa se milane kaa haq nahin he
 Do i have to go to court to visit my mother? Iltija further said that PM Modi is liberating butterflies but Kashmiris do not have freedom
 unhone kaha ki kashmir ke log aazaadee chaahate hai
 You arrested Farooq Abdullah under PSA
 yah sahi nahin he
 He said that the Bharatiya Janata Party has been constantly besieging the Congress on the issue of emergency
 aaj vahi bhaajapa kashmir main immergency laga rahi he
 90 lakh people are facing troubles in Kashmir
 lekin sarkaar ko isaki chintaa nahin he
 When Rajdeep asked what kind of solution do you want for Kashmir
 is sawaal par unhone kaha ki yah sarkaar kii banaai hui samasya he
 Now the government should think how it will be resolved
 lekin kuch bhi ho sarkaar ko kashmiriyon ko vishwaas main lenaa hoga
 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader and former Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani has said that 'cinema' has played an important role in popularizing Hindi as the national language
 adwani ne madhyapradesh sarkaar dwaara sthapit ‘natya vidhyalay’ kaa udghaatan karne ke baad ek samaaroh main kaha, ‘hindi ko lokapriy banane or uskaa puure desh main prachaar-prasar karne main kisi bhi anya madhyam kii tulana main ‘cinema’ ne ahm bhoomika kaa nirvaah kiya he
 He said that when he came to India from Karachi after partition at the age of twenty, he knew only Sindhi and English to read and write and whatever Hindi he understood, it was because of cinema
 adwani ne kaha ki haalaaki hindi cinema kaa janm gaiyr hindi bhashi shahar kolkata main hua, lekin vah mumbai, chennai, hyderabad jaise gaiyr hindi bhashi shaharon main hi phala-phula
 He congratulated Madhya Pradesh government for setting up the country's first 'natya Vidyalaya' in Bhopal after the prestigious National School of Drama (NSD) and said that it would be better if other states also develop similar facilities at their own
 purv up pradhanmantri ne ‘natya vidhyalay’ prabandhan se aagrah kiya ki vah apane yahaan anya praanton ke vidhyaarthiyon ko bhi pravesh den, kyonki is samay isamen madhyapradesh or bihar ke logon kii hi bahulata he
 He also suggested that other disciplines of Natya Shastra should be taught here along with other Indian languages
 unhone rajya sarkaar se kaha ki vah bhopal main ek bhavy sabhagrih kii suvidha de, taaki adhik se adhik log aise kaaryakramon kaa anand uthaa sake, kyonki vartmaan main uplabdh sabhagrihon kii kshamta kaaphi kam he

 samaaj main ladakiyon se hone vaale bhedbhaav or bhrunahatya ke khilaaf taiyaar kiye gaye is kaarykram kaa shubharambh karte hue modi ne kaha, "ham maansikta se atharahavin shatabdi ke naagarik hai
 
 
 We do not even allow the daughter to see her mother's face
 
 
 " pradhanmantri ne kaha ki is soch kaa nateeja yah hua he ki mahendragarh jaise jile main har 1,000 bacchon main 225 kunvaare hi rah jaaenge
 In order to tackle the problem of less number of girls than boys in many states including Haryana, 'beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' program will be launched in the first phase in 100 selected districts, where child sex ratio, ie child sex ratio is the lowest is
 in 100 jilon main panipat samet haryana ke 12 jile shaamil hai
 According to the 2011 census, Haryana has the least number of girls as compared to other states
 yahaan har 1,000 ladakon ke mukaable sirf 879 ladkiyaan hai, jabaki rashtriya ausat 941 kaa he
 In these districts targeted for the scheme, the government will strictly enforce the law to prevent pre-natal Diagnostic Test (PNDT)
 darasal, taiyaari in jilon main bhrunahatya ke khilaaf media campagne launch karne ke saath-saath ladakiyon ke liye shuru kii gai yojanaon ko bhi gambhirtha se lagu karne kii he
 The Prime Minister also launched 'sukanya Samriddhi Yojana' for social security of girls
 unhone kaha, "is yojana ke tahat 10 saal se kam umr kii beti ke maa-baap 1,000 se dedh lakh rupee bank main jamaa kar sakate hai, or is par unhen sarkaar kisi bhi bank se zyada byaaj degi

 Madhuri said, "if you don't have a daughter, where will you bring your daughter-in-law?" 
 
 ?" 'beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' is a new attempt to end discrimination against girls in society, but now the real challenge will be to change the mindset of the section of society which does not consider girls as equal to boys
 uttar pradesh ke mathura janapad main sthit govardhan ke ek sant ne chetavanee di he ki yadi ravan kaa putala jalaayaa jaataa he to vah iske khilaaf bhavishya main roak lagavane ke liye rashtriya harith adhikaran main chale jaaenge
 Significantly, a group of Brahmin youth of Saraswat gotra belonging to Lankesh Bhakta Mandal of Mathura has been opposing the effigy burning of Ravana on Dussehra for the last twenty years
 ve is maukey par das vidyaon ke gyaata evam prakand pandit ravan kii puja kaa aayojan karte hai
 Advocates Omvir Saraswat, Sanjay Saraswat etc
 associated with Lankesh Bhakta Mandal say that we have been opposing Ravana combustion for years
 iske liye shashan, prashasan va adaalat ke str par bhi aawaaj uthaai gai he kintu kisi ne hamaari maang par dhyaan nahin diya
 Therefore, if this time the effigy of Ravana is not banned from being burnt and this time also burnt on Dussehra, then surely one has to go to the shelter of NGT
 kyonki, yah masalaa keval dharmik bhaawanaaon ko chot pahunchane kaa hi nahin, paryaavaran pradooshan se bhi judaa hua he
 Supporting these youth, Swami Adhokshajanand, the saint of Govardhan, said, 'burning the effigy of Ravana is against Indian culture
 yah sanathan hindu samskruti kaa apmaan he
 The burning of someone is similar to his funeral and is done only once in Hindu culture
 kisi kaa baar-baar putala jalaayaa janaa uskaa makhul udaane ke samaan he

 After this meeting, both of them gave a statement that they are joining BJP
 shaam ko dilli main donon vidhayak bijepi main shaamil ho gaye
 But shortly after, the whole game turned around
 jab donon congress vidhayakon dayanand sopate or subhash shirodakar ne goa vidhansabha ke spikar ko apana istipha saunp diya
 And soon it was accepted
 in do vidhayakon ke istife ke saath hi congress se sabase bade dal kaa tamgaa bhi chhin gaya he
 Now what happened to the assembly? Goa has a total of 40 assembly seats, that is, a majority needs 21 seats
 BJP ke paas abhi tak 23 vidhayakon kaa samarthan tha, jabaki congress ke paas kul 16 vidhayak the
 Of the 23 in the NDA, BJP has 14, Goa Forward Party and Maharashtra Gomantak Party have 3–3 mlas and 3 Independents
 ab inamen se do congress vidhayak istipha de chuke hai
 That is, now the total number of mlas in the Assembly has increased to 38 and the number of 21 not 20 is needed for a majority
 congress ke paas ab kul 14 vidhayak hi bache hai
 Shah changed the whole game! On Tuesday, two Goa Congress mlas arrived in the capital Delhi to meet Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah's house
 donon vidhayakon ne mangalvaar shaam ko hi bhartiya janata party join kar lee
 Congress mlas Dayanand Sopte and Subhash Shirodkar came to meet Amit Shah on Tuesday
 donon MLA somvaar raat ko hi dilli ke liye ravaanaa hue the
 When the two mlas left for Delhi, then Goa's Health Minister Vishwajit Rane was also present
 tut gaya congress kaa bharosise mulaakaat se pehle goa congress ke prabharee kaa kahana tha ki donon vidhayakon ne unhen bharosa diya he ki vah party virdohi koi kaam nahin karenge
 But now the decision of the mlas shows that he had made up his mind to leave his party and he did so

 If you have seen Shyam Benegal's film 'well Done Abba' released in 2009, then you have seen a story of corruption in the construction of wells
 parde kii is kahani kaa asal jindagi main doharaav yaa yun kahe ki iskaa part tu in dinon jharkhand main chal rahaa he
 This story of plunder and corruption in the construction of wells can be gauged from the fact that out of 95 thousand wells constructed here in the last two years, 11 thousand have been buried under the ground
 manaregaa ke tahat banaae gaye in sarkari kuon kaa nirmaan rajya ke kalyaan vibhaag or REO dwaara kiya gaya
 It is alleged that in the game of these wells constructed between 2010-11, about 180 crore rupees have been spent
 udhaaharan ke taur par ranchi ke ratu ilaake ke lahana panchayat main manaregaa ke tahat beete do varshon main 25 kuen banawaye gaye
 Today 10 of these wells which have been exposed to corruption have either sunk or are incomplete
 ye baangi mahaj ek panchayat kii he
 In fact, two years ago, the BJP government launched a plan to create one lakh wells for better irrigation in the fields
 lekin aarope he ki jimmevaar afasaron ne kuen ke pani se kheton kii pyaas bujhane kii bajaay apni sukhi jeb ko geela karnaa zyada jaruri samajha
 Not only the officers but middlemen also dominated during this time and the fields of the drought stricken farmers remained barren
 ghatiya samragi or jagah ke chunaav main hui dhaandhleekhstahal kuon kaa dansh jhel rahe kisaanon aarope he ki kuon ke nirmaan main ghatiya saamagree kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Not only this, the election of places to build wells has been rigged
 inamen kai kuen aisi jagahon par banaae gaye hai, jahaan se shaayad hi kisi ko koi laabh ho
 That is, crores of rupees were dumped in the gutter of corruption
 kamity bani, report bhi ai, lekin
 
 
 It is not that the government is not aware of this
 vidhansabha main kuon kaa maamla uthne ke baad is ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye ek vidhansabha kamity kaa gathan kiya gaya tha

 lekin meeting main rahul gandhi ne jo poocha wo sun sab chaunk gayi
 According to sources, Rahul Gandhi wanted to know the opinion of the mlas on the arrogance created by the Samajwadi Party in the state
 unhone vidhayakon se poocha ki sapa ke netaaon main kiski chhavi behatar akhilesh yadav kii yaa phir mulaayam singh kii?siyaasi sameekaran badalejaahir he ki vidhayak iskaa zikr nahin kar rahe hai par wo bhi jaanate he ki sapa kii andruni ladaai ne siyaasi sameekaran badal ke rakh diye hai
 Otherwise, Rahul Gandhi who had said this a few months ago in the state meeting that there is no question of alliance with SP, why would he ask this question today? If sources are to be believed, most of the mlas responded to Rahul's question in favor of Akhilesh
 jis par rahul ne kaha ki wo vichaar vimarsh karke apni raay rakhenge
 Many mlas left the Congress, in fact, 9 Congress mlas have already left the party during the election season

 The Lok Sabha election ends this week
 is baar ke chunaav main kaaphi kuch nayaa dikhaa
 However, the most surprising thing is the presence of criminals with criminal background in the election field, which is the highest of all the elections so far
 chunaavon par nazar rakhane vaali sanstha ediaar-ellection vaach ke mutabik 2019 ke chunaav main 7928 ummidavaaron main se 1500 ummidavaaron ne apane khilaaf aapraadhik maamle dikalair kiye hai
 In 2009, there were criminal cases against 15% of the candidates, in 2014 elections there were 17% cases
 yah 2019 main badhkar 19% pahunch gaye hai
 In the 2019 elections, Murder cases are filed against 55 candidates and Attempt to Murder against 184 cases
 ediaar / ellection watch ke sansthaapak jagadeep chokar ne enditivi se kaha, "raajnneeti kaa apradheekaran lagaataar bad rahaa he lekin koi raajnneetik dal chintit nahin he
 "in the study of 7928 candidates in the election, it has also come to the fore that money is increasing in elections
 ediaar-ellection vaach ke mutabik 7928 ummidavaaron kii study main yah baat bhi saamne ai he ki kul 2297 ummidavaar karodpati hai yani 29 pratishat! yah mahatvapurn he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 27% ummidavaar karodpati the
 Whereas in the 2009 elections, only 16% of the candidates were millionaires
 ediaar / ellection watch ke head anil verma ne enditivi se kaha, "raajnneeti main paise kaa bolbalaa bad rahaa he
 "anil Verma says that the money is being spent wildly in elections and there is no hindrance on how much political parties can spend
 anil verma ne kaha - ab samay aa gaya he ki raajnneetik dal chunaavon main kitna paisa kharch kar sakate hai, isaki seemaa tay kii jaae
 Another worrying matter is the representation of women
 2019 ke chunaavon main sirf 9% ummidavaar mahila hai
 However, the situation was worse in 2009 when only 7% women candidates were in the fray
 san 2014 ke chunaav main maamuli badhottaree hui thi or mahila ummidavaaron kii bhagidaari badhkar 8% ho gai thi

 The state government has made several unsuccessful attempts to get rid of Union Carbide's waste and this time it seems to be failing
 kendriya grih mantri pi
 The Empowered Group of Ministers led by Chidambaram had directed the state government to compromise with the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) for disposal of waste
 jiiged ko factory main pade 350 ton kachare ko germany le jaakar nasht karne ke liye 25 karod ru
 Had to meet lekin germany main jahrile kachare kaa virodh shuru ho gaya
 The state government's Gas Relief and Rehabilitation Minister, Babulal Gaur, who was responsible for the waste, said, "this is a headache for the German government
 vahi ise suljhaegi
 The state government had kept its monotonous stance on disposal of toxic waste for a long time
 baad main ise gujarat ke ankleshwar, madhya pradesh ke audyogic kshetra pithampur or nagpur ke diardio main bhejne kii naakaam koshishen huin
 The Central Government then proposed to send the waste to Maharashtra in January this year, which was opposed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board
 iske baad pradesh sarkaar ne phir se pithampur ko kachare kii kabrgah bananaa chaha lekin audyogic sanghathanon ke virodh ke chalate aisa ho nahin paaya
 Now Germany's nature conservation institutions are also opposing bringing the waste here
 yahaan ke antarrashtriya broadcaster diache vele ke mutabik prakruti sangrakshan samooh biuandi kii jaharila kachra nishpaadan visheshgy clodia battinger ne kaha he, ''kachare kaa nibataan sthaneey str par hona chahie
 Opposing the transfer of toxic waste, Greenpeace has also said that India should develop technology to destroy such waste
 bhopal ke gas peedit sanghathanon kii raay bhi kuch aisi hi he
 Rachna Dhingra of Bhopal Group for Information and Action says, "the government is taking care of the garbage lying inside the factory while thousands of tons of garbage are suppressed outside
 kya vah itane kachare ko germany bhej paaegi? baaki kaa kachra sthaneey str par hi nasht ho or iskaa kharch dou chemicals se liya jaae
 "the people of Germany have every right to protest," says Abdul Jabbar, convenor of the Bhopal Gas Victim Women's Industry Organization
 haalanki iske chalate kachare ko nasht karne main or deree hogi

 haalanki jammu kashmir police ne pradesh main shanti vyavastha kaa daawa kiya he
 Demonetisation and GST have brought opposing parties and leaders of each other sitting in opposition
 modi virodhiyon main shaayad yah soch paidaa ho rahi he ki is samay vah akele modi kaa saamana nahin kar sakate hai
 This theory is strengthened by the meeting of Mamta Banerjee and Uddhav Thackeray
 aapako bataa den ki shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne guuruuvaar ko pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee se mumbai main mulaakaat kii
 The market of speculation has been heated up by the meeting of Mamata Banerjee, who was separated from the NDA on bjp's communal and secularism, and the Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, who represents communal politics, at the beginning of Modi's tenure in Modi
 haalanki donon netaaon ne ise bas shishtacharvash kii gai mulaakaat bataaya he
 After this meeting, Uddhav Thackeray himself said that our views on issues like demonetisation and GST are the same
 ham donon is masale par bolte rahe hai
 Let's see what form things take
 shivasena maharashtra main bhaajapa ke netritv vaali gathbandhan sarkaar main sahyogi party he, lekin rajya main donon sahyogi dalon ke sambandh tanaavpurn bane hue hai
 Shiv Sena and Mamata's Trinamool Congress have criticized BJP and Modi government on many issues
 vahiin aapako bataa den ki shivasena jahaan pro hindu or marathi raajnneeti ke liye jaani jaati he to vahiin mamata banerjee pro muslim drushtikon or bengali asmita ko apana hathiyaar maanati hai
 In such a situation, it will be seen that for a powerful opposition, both can be one of the parties who do politics of different views? Lalu and 'AAP' are also in opposition, apart from Shiv Sena and Trinamool Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal There are two such parties which are continuously opposing the Modi government on zonatbandi and GST
 haalanki donon partiyon ke pramukhon kii chhavi ekadam ulat he
 While Arvind Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party are seen fighting on every front to end corruption, Lalu Yadav and his family are facing many allegations of corruption
 saath hi unki party samay samay par in aaropon par safai bhi detii rahati he
 For the last few days both parties have been continuously attacking the Modi government on demonetisation and GST from social media and statements
 ek taraf jahaan aam aadmi party ne 8 navambar ko 'dhokhaa diwas' manaane kii ghoshnaa kii he
 The RJD has also been an attacker on the Modi government since the RBI report
 lalu yadav ne khud twit kar amit shah or bijepi par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Lalu had tweeted that while India's economy suffered from GST and demonetisation, the wealth of Amit Shah's son increased by 300 times
 aapako bataa den ki modi virodh main donon leader purv main ek manch par aa chuke hai
 In such a situation, it will be seen whether the Aam Aadmi Party and RJD will come together and oppose Modi to capitalize on the demonetisation and GST issue

 The VHP general secretary refused to accept the childbirth as a personal wish and said, "this decision is not limited to just the couple
" aisa hota to aaj desh kaa vibhaajan nahin hota
 Wherever the balance of the population deteriorates on religious grounds, governments in the world give money to have children

 kolkata pustak meley main virodh ke chalate apni kitaab kaa aadhikarik vimochan radd hone ke ek din baad vivaadaaspad bangladeshi lekhika tasalima nasrin ne daawa kiya he ki unke jivan tathaa upanyaason par film kii yojana banane vaale teen bengali film nirdeshkon ne ab apane pair peeche khinch liye hai
 Talking about his life and the proposal to produce films on two novels 'shodh' and 'invitation', Taslima told New Delhi, "the agreement was signed, but the directors suddenly kept silence
" ’nirdeshkon par dabaav padane kaa sanket dete hue unhone kaha, ‘mujhe nahin pataa ki unke saath kya hua
 Who prevented him from making films
 ’ haalanki, unhone yah nahin bataaya ki nirdeshkon par kisne dabaav daalaa hoga
 The publishers of the new book meanwhile claimed that the sale of 'exile', the seventh part of Taslima's autobiography, increased
 kattarpathiyon ke virodh pradarshan ke baad pustak mela ke aayojak is pustak ke aadhikarik vimochan ko radd karne par majaboor hue the
 It was released outside the venue scheduled to release the book after organizers cited security concerns
 prakaashak pipuls book sosayadi kii shibani mukherjee ne bataaya, ‘hamane nae sanskaran kaa order diya he
 One thousand copies of the first edition have been sold
 ham is bikri se kaaphi utsahit hai
 'this book has already been sold at the bookstore and stall in the book fair
 prakaashak ne kaha, ‘vishesh rup se mahilaayein hamaare book stall par tut pad rahi hai
 He also emphasized that there is nothing controversial in the subject matter of the book
 is kitaab main kolkata se november 2007 main tasalima ko baahar bheje jane ke baad lekhika ke sansmaranon ko sangrahit kiya gaya he
 The book written in Bangla mentions the circumstances that led to the government sending him to New Delhi and as a result he had to undergo mental stress and insecurity of being homeless
 tasalima ne kaha, ‘pustak kahin se bhi mudda nahin he
 Showdown is the issue
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘na to kattarpathiyon or na hi sarkaar ke logon ne pustak padhi he
 If someone organizes a 'taslima Flower Show', they will demand a ban on it too

 The Delhi High Court has set aside the Delhi government's decision in the matter related to the release of old age and widow pension through the legislator
 pension paane kii prakiya ab pehle kii tarah hi lagu hogi
 People taking pension can apply on the government portal itself
 dilli sarkaar ne online pension band kar di thi
 Not only this, the Social Welfare Office was also closed by the government
 pension ke liye vidhayak karyaalay main hi jaakar applai karnaa pad rahaa tha
 The password was also applied to apply from the MLA office itself
 is vajah se logon kaa public transport se vidhayak ke daftar tak pahunchnaa mushkil ho rahaa tha
 There was also an allegation that only those associated with the party were being given benefit in the MLA office
 pension ko lekar in offison main koi bhi shedul nahin bana tha
 Because of this, the aged and widows were forced to eat for pension
 jiske baad dilli hai court ne dilli sarkaar ke soshal welfare vibhaag sachiv se pichhali sunwaayee par jawaab maanga tha, jis par hi unhone kaha tha ki aadhaar card kii anivaaryta se logon ko pareshaani ho rahi thi
 It was therefore decided that this pension be released through the MLA
 lekin hoicourt ne paaya ki vidhayak ke madhyam se pension lene main logon ko zyada pareshaani ho rahi he
 The High Court said in its order that now there is more trouble than before, so the Delhi government should make efforts to improve the portal itself
 hoicourt ne suzav diya ki portal ko auto mod main bhi open rahane diya jaae
 Therefore, if a beneficiary dies, then the space to apply in the portal itself is created
 isse raajnneetik hastkshep bhi hatega or applai karne vaale vyakti ko bhi zyada intjaar nahin karnaa padegaa
 In fact, the Delhi government had decided to end the imperative of Aadhaar to provide easy pension to widows and the elderly
 sarkaar kii soch thi ki aadhaar card kii anivaaryta se logon ko pareshaani ho rahi thi
 But a PIL was filed in the Delhi High Court against the decision of the Delhi government
 yachika ke jariye dilli sarkaar ke pension relies karne ke ek maatr adhikaar ilaake ke vidhayak ko saunpe jane ko lekar kiye gaye sarkaar ke faisle ko chunauti di gai
 In the petition, door step delivery of Delhi government was also presented before the court as an example
 yachikakarta kaa kahana tha ki ek taraf to sarkaar door step delivery ke jariye behatar suvidhaayen or logon kii samasya jald sulajhane kaa daawa kar rahi he
 At the same time, the government itself is facing trouble for the elderly and widows
 hai court ne is par dilli sarkaar se halafanama maanga or dilli sarkaar ke vakil ne halafname ke tahat court ko bataaya ki pension yojana main shikayaton ke aadhaar par hi yah faisla liya gaya tha
 But the High Court was dissatisfied with the government's affidavit
 court kaa kahana tha ki yah ek sarkari skim he
 In such a situation, how can the Delhi government give such rights to its MLA and that too on first come first serve basis
 court kaa kahana tha ki agar sarkaar ko kuch shikaayatein mili hai to uskaa samaadhaan soshal welfare vibhaag dwaara kiya janaa chahie
 That is why the High Court quashed the Delhi government's decision
 duniya ke sabhi patiyon or premiyon se (mazaakia) nivedan he ki ve thodaa sa satark rahanaa sikh len
