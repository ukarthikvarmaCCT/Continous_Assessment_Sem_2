 vaise bhi north east democratic alliance (enidie) main enpipi bijepi kii sahyogi he or bijepi netaa bhi usase gathbandhan ko taiyaar dikh rahe hai
 BJP has also got two seats in the state
 baithkon kaa daur shurubijepi se pehle hi congress netritv ne varisht netaa kamalnath or ahamed patel ko shilong bhej diya he
 On reaching Shillong, Ahmed Patel said that we have come here to form the government
 is kram main meghalaya congress ke netaaon ke saath kendriya netritv shilong main baithak kar rahaa he
 It is clear from the results that the Congress can save its power in the state if it is able to bring some independents or small party mlas with them
 aise main jo bhi pehle nirdaleey yaa chote dalon ko apane kheme main le legaa, vahi meghalaya main sarkaar bana paaegaa
 The mistake was made in Goa, Congress got 17 seats in Goa and it was only 5 seats behind by majority, despite its BJP formed government with the help of allies
 mgm, goa forward party ke alaava 3 nirdaleey vidhayak bijepi netaa or purv siem manohar parrikar ko mukhyamantri banaae jane kii shart par bijepi ko samarthan dene ko raji ho gaye the
 After this, BJP claimed the support of 22 mlas in the 40-member Goa Legislative Assembly
 goa main sarkaar banane main congress ne susti dikhaai yahi vajah rahi ki sabase badi party rahane ke baavjood congress ko soobe kii satta se haath dhonaa padaa tha
 The Congress won 28 seats out of 60 assembly seats in Manipur, while the BJP could win only 21 seats
 bijepi ne sarkaar banane ke liye congress ke kuch baagi vidhayakon se haath mila liya or congress ko chunavi ranneeti ke saath-saath sarkaar banane main bhi peeche chhod diya

 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Murali Manohar Joshi is now becoming a philosopher about politics in which he has been for so many years
 kai terms main rajyasabha or loksabhaa donon main rahane vaale murali manohar joshi ne ab mazaakia andaaz main kahana shuru kar diya he ki wo agar prayag main paidaa hue, kaashi main padhai likhaai kii to uske baad siyasat kaa or sansad main rahane kaa paap kar baithe
 Now the question arises that the demand of Modi to fight from his seat in Uttar Pradesh is arising among the workers and maybe this is the only way that Joshi can get rid of his old sins
 lekin, ye faisalaa to bhartiya janata party ko karnaa he
 But the mood of Joshi ji is definitely reflected in his philosophical and at the same time it is also true that bjp's mood is away from Joshi's philosophical mood for Modi

 They feared that if they continue to fight with each other about the specifics of the constitution, a counter-revolution may be born in the country

 For example, the inclusion of the entire southern plains of Nepal had become the agenda of the Madheshi movement in 2007
 aakhirkaar madheshiyon ke vidroh ne nae samvidhan ke liye sanghavaad ko ek maardarshak siddhant ke taur par sthapit kar diya
 The first Constituent Assembly elected in 2008 was dissolved in 2012, even before the constitution was made, as the largest coalition Maoists and Madheshi parties did not have a two-thirds majority to draft the constitution
 badi ladaai is baat ko lekar thi ki nepal main kis tarah kaa sanghavaad hona chahie
 The Maoist and Madheshi parties wanted the federal provinces to be determined on the ethnic basis
 lekin nepali congress or sipien-yumail iske khilaaf thim

 After the second election of the Constituent Assembly, the movement for federalism on the basis of caste had weakened, but its threat remained

 This is the biggest question of India's concern

 Prabhu Sah, who represents Madheshi region in the Constituent Assembly, says, "the easternmost three districts of the plains should be included in province 2
 ''asantosh kaa doosraa bada kaaran yah he ki lambey samay se madheshiyon ke saath bhedbhaav kiya jaataa rahaa he
 This feeling of discrimination has only fueled the growing anger among the Madheshi people
 rajnatik vishleshak rajesh ahiraaj kehete hai, ''kathmando or madheshiyon ke bich ek badi manovaigyanik duuri he
 Kathmandu still does not communicate directly with Madheshi public
 ''nepal main sanghavaad ek jatil mudda ban chukaa he
 Although the constitution has been announced, the big parties say that they are ready to solve the problems through dialogue
 nepal ke rajnatik sankat ko hal karne ke liye ek bade padosi ke taur par bharat kaa sahyog bahut mahatv rakhata he, lekin nepal main jabaran rajnatik sahmati banane ke liye aarthik nakaabandi kii dhamkee dena bhi bharat ke hit main nahin hoga
 Doing so will give more air to the protests and the situation will become more complicated than before

 police adhikari ne bataaya ki ajahar ne unase kaha tha ki main portugal ke farji passport par yahaan aayaa taaki sunishchit kar sakuun ki echyuem or huji ghati main ek saath aaen

 Rahul Gandhi said, 'mulayam Singh has seen the fate of the agreement with Kalyan Singh, our agreement is with the people
 mujhe satta nahin chahie, main parivartan or aam aadmi ko insaaf dilaane aayaa hum

 aam aadmi party kii trade wing ne dilli nagar se factory license khatm karne kii maang kii he
 According to the 'AAP' trade wing, problems are increasing with regard to MCD factory licenses in the industrial area of delhi
 is silsile main trade wing jald hi teenon emsidi ke kamishnaron se mil kar factory maalikon kii shikaayat saajha karegi
 Brijesh Goyal, the Conveyor of AAP trade wing, issued a statement saying that most of the factory owners complain that no work is done by the MCD in all the industrial areas
 goyal ne aarope lagaate hue kaha ki factory license kii sari jimmedaari diesidisi kii he, lekin iske baavjood vyapaariyon ko emsidi ke jaal main fansaaya ja rahaa he
 Because of this, the factory owners are not only having to face Inspector Raj, but also have to pay bribe for license renewal
 aam aadmi party kii trade wing ne elaan kiya he ki MCD ke factory license ko lekar shikaayatein milane ke baad vyapaaree ab emsidi main kabiz bijepi ko uskaa chunavi vaada yaad dilavaayenge
 Where BJP had spoken of abolishing MCD license
 brijesh goyal ne bataaya ki dilli main 28 registerd indstrial aria hai
 All of these are handled by DSIIDC
 vahaan ke siver, sadak kaa rakrakhaav aadi sab diesidisi karti he
 There are water boards for water connections and electricity companies for electricity connections
 emsidi kii bhoomika dur-dur tak nahin he, lekin iske baavjood factory maalikon ko ab bhi emsidi license rineau karana padataa he
 According to the AAP trade wing, the industrial regulation of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi is of 1957
 us samay dilli main koi bhi vidhivat sthapati industrial aria nahin tha
 The responsibility of supplying electric water was with the MCD
 yahi kaaran tha ki us samay emsidi se license lenaa padataa tha
 But the 1957 law is still being carried
 us samay udyog sthapit karne se purv kshetra kii sthiti, bijli pani kii maang or aapurti kii sthiti, udyog main karyrat mazdooron kii sankhya ke aadhaar par naagarik sevaayen uplabdh karaane ke liye pehle emsidi kii sweekruti aavashyak thi, lekin ab halaat badal chuke hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has asked the question that if the power supply is with the private company, the water is under the Delhi Jal Board
 industrial aria main koun sa udyog chalaaya ja saktaa he, yah dilli pradooshan niyantran cameti tay karti he
 The responsibility of all industrial areas is now entrusted to DSIIDC
 to in sabake baavjood bhi emsidi kis kshamta se industrial license jari kar rahi he?goyal ne dilli ke vaid audyogic kshetron se nagar nigam factory license turant prabhaav se khatm karne kimang uthaihe
 Goyal says that the Government of India talks about ending Inspector Raj for smooth operation of industry / business
 aise main dilli ke niyamit audyogic kshetron main emsidi factory license kya bharat sarkaar kii pahal ke vipareet nahi hai?

 kranges netaa or vivaadon ke chalate surkhiyon main rahane vaale shashi tharur ne kaha he ki samay aa chukaa he jab bharat ko ganje or bhaang jaise nashe ke utpaada ko kanoonee manyata de deni chahie
 Tharoor has argued that taking this step has become necessary so that other countries do not leave India behind in the business of cannabis
 shashi tharur ne yah maang ek lekh likhte hue jaahir kii he or daawa bhi kiya he ki nashe ke in utpaadon ko kanoonee manyata dene se desh main ise judi aapraadhik gatividhiyaan puri tarah khatm ho jaaengi
 Apart from this, this step of India will prove to be an example for the whole world at a time when the exercise to give it legal recognition in many countries is going on
 shashi tharur ne apni maang ke peeche yah bhi aashwaasan diya he ki desh main ganja-bhaang ke utpaadan, aapurti or upyog ko kanoonee manyata dene se iske istemaal se hone vaale nuksaan main giravat aegi, bhrashtachar or aparaadh kaa graph neeche aayega or in badlaavon ke saath hi desh kii arthvyavastha ko ek bada boost milegaa
 Citing one of his nephews, Avinash Tharoor, Tharoor has said that Avinash works in the field of drugs control and the global research suggests that law recognition of hemp-cannabis will benefit everyone
 tharur ne bataaya ki bhartiya kanoon main 1985 main pehali baar bhaang par pratibandh lagaaya gaya
 However, the Government of India signed the Narcotic Drugs Treaty internationally in 1961, almost two decades before this ban was added to the law
 haalanki bharat main kuch rajyon main bhaang ko kanoonee manyata he lekin ganja puri tarah se pratibandhit he
 Shashi Tharoor questioned the terminology of the treaty, stating that the treaty is full of social and economic danger, calling cannabis and cannabis a grave evil
 lekin tharur ke mutabik sharaab, tambaakoo samet kai tarah ke aise drugs jo gharon main dawa ke dibbe main paae jate hai ki tulana main ganja or bhaang kam nuksaan pahunchaate hai or sandhi main iske nuksaan ko atishyokti ke saath pesh kiya gaya he

 maujuuda samay main ganja or bhaang ke vyapaar ko gaiyrkanoonee banaakar puure kaarobaar ko aapraadhik bazaar ke hawaale kar rakhaa he
 Hence, it needs to be regularized that it should be cultivated by responsible farmers in the country, it should be tested in post-production laboratories identified and after packing it should be sold by a licensed retail center
 maujuuda samay main ise kharidne ke liye aapraadhik bazaar kaa darwaja khatkhataana padataa he jahaan kisi bhi aise utpaada kii gunvattta kii koi guarantee nahin rahati
 Due to this, there is no ill effect of its ill effects on its users
 saath hi is bazaar se kisi tarah kaa rajasav sarkaar ke khajaane main nahin pahunchataa
 Therefore, with this recognition, these flaws will be removed and the buyers will also know very well what concentration of the product they are consuming
 vahiin sarkaar ko milane vaale rajasav se iske jokhimon ke prati logon ko shikshit karne kaa kaam kiya ja sakegaa
 Shashi Tharoor has mentioned in the article quoting his nephew that the war on drugs which has been going on in the world for the last 50 years has been abolished
 ise khatm karne ke peeche duniyabar ke hajaaron enjio, rajaneta or vaigyanikon kaa tark shaamil he
 Significantly, it also includes former UN chief Kofi Annan and Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa in the field of literature
 shashi tharur kii daleel he ki ganja or bhaang gaiyrkanoonee hone ke chalate badi sankhya main log jail main kaid hai
 Along with their maintenance, there is a huge expense of police administration in the raids and lawsuits
 lihaaja, ise kanoonee manyata dene se is kharch kii bachat hogi or saath hi saath desh main ek nae udyog ko khadaa kiya ja sakegaa jisase desh arthvyavastha majboot hogi
 Tharoor cited the example of the US state of Colorado where 1 during 2017 to substantiate his argument
 5 billian dollar mulya ke is utpaada kii bikri kii gai
 Although the population of Colorado is just 0 of the population of Bharti
 4 fisadi he lihaaja andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki bharat main ise kanoonee manyata milane se kitne bade kaarobaar ko khadaa kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, Shashi Tharoor said that with the help of this new business, from farms to factories and retail markets, the government can create thousands of jobs
 ise bhi padhein: notebandi main chunaav: upi main 19 lakh bottle sharaab or 110 karod cash jabtalihaaja, in tarkon ke saath shashi tharur kehete hai ki ganja or bhaang bharat ko ek pragatisheel chalaang kaa mauka de sakate hai
 Plants of this product were found first in the Indian subcontinent after which it was grown all over the world
 iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki is paudhe kii do pramukh prajatiyon main ek cannabies indica kaa naam india par rakhaa gaya he
 After these facts, the way in which the product is being legalized in the US and Canada, if it succeeds, India will miss a big opportunity

 They will have the right to appeal within 30 days against any order which indicts them

 40 din kii sunwaayee ke baad ummid he ki desh ke is sabase puraane mukademe kaa faisla surakshit yani jajment rigerv ho jaae
 Then it is possible that the decision will come after about a month
 ab aap soch rahe honge ki ek maheenaa kyon
 Now the court has heard the argument, why don't you just hear the Judgment

 The original document of 30 thousand pages explores several times in the Judgment, including the texts, poems, sher-o-shayari or verses or verses
 ab ye ayodhya maamle kaa sawaal hi len to isamen 30 hajaar pej ke to mul dastavej hai or saath hi unka anuwaad
 Seven big boxes in the court are filled with original documents
 sab par jajon ke naam bhi likhe hai
 Also read- Ayodhya case: When CJI asked Muslim side- Are you satisfied? Apart from these, everyone's arguments, referring to various texts, as well as many things, arguments and evidence or reports
 in sabaki tasdik karne or unka saar nikaalane main vakt, mehnat or kaabiliyat to lagati hi he na?ab bataaie ek maheenaa zyada he kya? yahi vajah he ki adaalat mukademe kii sunwaayee puri karke faisla surakshit rakh leti hai
 After this, the court also tells all the parties that now whatever they want to say can be told through written statement ie Riten submission
 yani faisla surakshit hone ke baad se faisla likhe jane tak `mukadmaa' in rahon se gujarata he

 Lashing out at the Election Commission, Mayawati said that banning me without listening to the party and modi-shah has an open exemption
 ye abhootpurv nirnay ayog dwaara diya gaya he jo bagaiyr kisi sunwaayee or safai ke krurta purna he

 The BSP supremo said that if our government is formed then i will compensate this act with interest and will first come to Agra and Fatehpur
 mayawati ne kaha ki yogi ne hamen yaad dilaayaa ki bajrang bali dalit the, ham shukraguzaar hai ki ab bajrang bali bhi hamaare hai or ali bhi hamaare hai
 He said that Prime Minister Modi himself is using the army, but the Commission is not prohibiting them
 dikhaave ke liye yogi par ayog ne kuch der kii roak lagaai he
 The Commission is unable to dare to ban Narendra Modi
 ye chunaav ayog kii dalit virdohi maansikta he
 Mayawati said that the Commission has not given any order against Modi and Amit Shah even though they are openly spreading hatred
 mayawati ne samarthakon se kaha ki is aadesh ke peeche kii manshaa samajhen or ekajute hokar bhartiya janata party ke pratyaashiyon kii jamaanat jabt karaaen, yahi sahi myne main chunaav ayog kaa jawaab hoga

 During this time neither of the two leaders will be able to address any rally nor will they be able to use social media
 mayawati 16 or 17 april ko koi chunaav prachaar nahin kar paaengi
 What was Mayawati's statement? BSP chief Mayawati appealed to the Muslim community for votes during the election meeting in Deoband, UP
 mayawati ne apane sambodhan main kaha tha ki muslim samudaay ke log apana vot bantane naa den or sirf mahagathbandhan ke liye vot den
 Mayawati's statement is considered to be a violation of the rule of seeking votes in the name of religion
 vahiin, upi ke siem yogi adityanath ne apane ek sambodhan main mayawati par hamalaa karte hue kaha tha ki agar vipaksh ko ali pasand he, to hamen bajrang bali pasand hai
 The Election Commission had taken cognizance of these statements of both the leaders and instructed the two leaders
 supreme court ne lagaai thi ayog ko fatkarsomvaar subah hi supreme court ne mayawati ke devband raily main die gaye bhaashan par aapatti jataai thi
 The Election Commission was reprimanded by the court as to what action the Commission has taken in this case so far
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki ayog abhi tak sirf notice hi jari kar rahaa he, koi sakht ection kyon nahin le rahaa he

 i do not believe he is a good prime ministerial candidate

 This investigating agency official had said in the petition that Nageshwar Rao transferred him to Port Blair on October 24, 2018 and once again he ignored the verdict of the top court in the Alok Verma case and sent him to Andaman Nicobar
 bassi ne apni yachika main jaanch beuro ke antarim nideshak ke 11 janvari ke tabadalaa aadesh ko chunauti dete hue kaha he ki isse jaanch agency ke purv nideshak alok kumaar verma ke maamle main nyaayalay ke nirdeshon kaa ulanghan hota he
 Although Alok Verma was reinstated to the post of Director of the investigating agency following the January 8 verdict of the apex court, he was removed from the post only two days later due to corruption and negligence in discharging responsibilities by a high-powered committee
 sheersh adaalat ne apane faisle main bassi sahit un sabhi adhikariyon, jinka verma ko avkaash par bhejne ke centre sarkaar ke faisle ke baad alag-alag sthanon par tabadalaa kiya gaya tha, se kaha tha ki ve apane tabadalon ke maamle main uchit manch se sampark karen
 According to this official, on January 9, after Verma's reinstatement, he made a report to the director of the investigating agency, on which he was transferred back to Delhi
 bassi ne apni yachika main kaha he ki yah aadesh aise adhikari ne diya he jo aise aadesh dene ke liye sakasham nahin he
 The petition stated that the purpose of this order is to exploit them and this is going to unfairly affect the investigation of the FIR lodged against Rakesh Asthana on October 15, 2018
 bassi ne yachika main yah bhi kaha he ki vah asthana se sambandhit praathmiki kii jaanch karne vaale jaanch dal yaa kisi anya maamle kii jaanch kar rahe beuro ke dal kaa hissaa banane kaa daawa nahin kar rahe hai

 Had it been a private company, its shares would have become a missile on such a merger but the investors' capital in the ill-fated BEL was blown away as the government arbitrarily reduced the margins on the sale to the company
 is aadesh ke daayre main company kaa lagbhag aadha kaarobaar aata he
 Therefore, the shares of India's missile maker fell short

 Of these, a combined loss of 71 companies was recorded at Rs 31,000 crore
 52 companiyaan to pichley paanch yaa adhik saal se ghate main hai
 It is worth mentioning that government banks are not included in this list
 kai companiyon ke ghate to unki puunji bhi khatm kar chuke hai
 Those who think the advice of closing or privatizing government companies is exaggerated should consider these facts
 
 
 ▪ sarkari companiyon kaa aadhe se adhik (52 fisad) ghaataa beasenel, emtnael or air india ke naam he
 If the postal department with a loss of Rs 15,000 crore is added to it, the government can run many water and sanitation missions or direct income transfers only after getting rid of them
 yah ghaataa utpaadan companiyaan jin udyogon main kaam kar rahi hai, vahaan nijee kshetra fal-phool rahaa he

 Despite the opinion of NITI Aayog, the Modi government could barely close two small companies in the last five years

 BSNL can run the network only on the budget subsidy in the border areas

 Congress has increased the membership fee of the Congress party, which has been continuously losing elections
 congress ne party sadsyta shulk ko ek rupee se badhaakar 250 rupee kar diya he

 iske alaava party ne shulk jamaa karne ke niyamon main bhi badlaav kiya he
 Earlier 90 per cent of the fee was with the state units and only 10 per cent reached the central office
 ab party ne faisla liya he ki shulk main se 75 fisadi hissaa kendriya karyaalay ke paas aayega or sirf 25 fisadi hi pradesh ikai ke paas rahegaa
 Treasurer of Congress Motilal Vohra has said, 'it has now been decided that Rs 250 will be charged annually from each member
 yah kadam isliye uthaaya ja rahaa he taaki shulk vasuulne kii prakriya ko aasaan banaaya ja sake or prayek sadsy ko apni sadsyta yaad rakhane main aasaani ho

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 ham sab apane−apane shikshakon ko tarah−tarah se yaad karte hai
 Some with reverence and some with great vigor
 shikshakon kii bhi duniya ekares nahin he
 Teachers in government schools have different stories, while private schools have different stories
 sarkari skulon main bhi sthaayee or kantrect par padhaane vaale shikshakon kii kahani alag−alag he
 Similarly, in private schools, some teacher's salary is very good and some are very poor
 aae din hamaare teacher apni maangon ko lekar alag-alag rajyon kii vidhansabhaon ke saamne lathi khate rahete hai
 Trust of teacher if elections are held
 janaganana honi he to teacher ke bharose
 As much as society is not dependent on teachers, government is more dependent on them
 shikshak diwas kii aupchaarik bhavukta se alag hatakar kya ham apane shikshakon ko dekh sakate hai
 For example, how is his relationship with society and government
 unki apni samasyaayein kya hai
 Whether there is any synergy between the facilities between which they are doing teaching work and the kind of facilities which are flourishing in the society
 kul milakar shikshak raashtra ke nirmaataa hai
 The soul of the country or the creator of the character, how can we see the role of the teacher as a social element by moving out of the fine essays of type
 aksar netaa 5 sitambar ke din yaa uske aas-paas apane teacher hone ke sansmaran yaa ek teacher ko lekar apane sansmaran yaa desh duniya ke kuch ullekhneey shikshakon ke yogadan ko yaad kar bhavuk kar dete hai
 But when these teachers return to their schools, how would they look at the country and society
 samaaj main inke bare main kisi kisi chhaviyaan vyaapt hai
 So we thought that the President, who is honoring the teachers on the occasion of Teacher's Day, should openly talk with them
 dekha jaae ki wo kitna khulkar apni baat saamne rakh pate hai
 Some teachers who have come to Delhi from different places are with us in the studio today
 to aap sab darshakon kii taraf se yahaan maujuud shikshakon ko badhai

 But a little bit of hard work also brings out other aspects of the news
 hyderabad ke makka masjid blast kaa sandarbh diya
 The incident took place on 18 May 2007
 5 bam dhamaake hue the, 18 log mare the
 In April 2011, the case came to the NIA from the CBI
 sabase pehle rajya sarkaar kii police ne jaanch kii thi
 You can see the news of the Indian Express of 16 April 2018
 226 gavaahon kii jaanch ke baad faisla kya aayaa
 NIA special court acquitted 5 people arrested in Mecca Masjid blast
 adaalat ne kaha ki jaanch agency kisi ko doshi sabit karne main naakaam rahi he
 Navakumar Sarkar, Swami Aseemanand, Ajay Tiwari, Laxmandas Maharaj, Mohanlal Rateshwar and Rajendra Chaudhary were acquitted of charges
 kya kabhi makka masjid blast ke aaropee pakade jaaenge
 After 11 years, we have no answer except political debate
 kya itnaa aasaan he ki enie ek sarkaar ke tahat aseemanand ko fansaa le, duusari sarkaar ke tahat bari hone par swaagat ho
 If people were falsely implicated then what action was taken against the police officers
 kuch hui
 Did the NIA ever tell what happened in this case that she could not prove anyone guilty in seven
 grahamantralay kii taraf se The National Investigation Agency (amendment) Bill-2019 pesh kiya gaya tha
 This bill has passed
 sarkaar ne bharosa diya ki yah kanoon aatankwaad ke prati zero tolerance kii niti ko lagu karne ke liye zaruri tha
 The opposition said that this law would transform India into a police state
 is kanoon ke mutabik enie ko maanav taskari, phek karency, pratibandhit hathiyaaron kaa bananaa or bechnaa, sibar aatankwaad ke maamalon main bhi jaanch kaa adhikaar mil jayega
 Special courts will also be set up to hear such cases
 congress ke netaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki enie ko is tarah bina kisi ankush ke shaktiyaan di ja rahi hai, aisi shaktiyon kaa istamaal raajnneetik dushmani ke liye hone lagegaa
 Congress's Ravneet Singh said that the investigation of the NIA case should be completed within three months
 giraftaar ke samay to hangaamaa hota he uske baad koi sud nahin letaa
 Home Minister Amit Shah dismissed the opposition's allegations that these laws would be misused
 unhone vipaksh par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki pota kaa koi durupyog nahin hua tha lekin polytical kaarnon se us kanoon ko hataa diya gaya jisase aatankwaadiyon ko manobal kaaphi bad gaya tha
 Wasn't POTA really misused
 2002 main akshardham aatanki hamale ke maamle main 6 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 They were all arrested under POTA
 2014 main supreme court ne sabhi aropiyon ko bari kar diya

 inamen se loar court ne do aropiyon ko faansee kii sazaa di thi
 Mohammad Salim, Abdul Mian, Altaf Malik, Adam Bhai Ajmeri, Abdul Qayoom, Chand Khan were acquitted after 11 years in jail
 agar pota kaa durupyog nahin hua tha to ye kya tha
 After being acquitted, Mohammed Salim said that the Gujarat Police had asked him in which to stop the Godhra incident, the Haren Pandya murder case or the Akshardham terror attack
 supreme court ne kaha ki inhen fansaaya gaya lekin ham or aap kabhi nahin jaan sakenge ki inhen kiske ishaare par fansaaya gaya or un logon ko kya raajnneetik laabh mila
 The Home Minister should also be reminded of the case of Vaiko who was an ally of the Vajpayee government
 11 july 2002 ko vico pota ke tahat giraftaar kar liye gaye
 MDMK was a partner of NDA
 hindu frontline main ve venkatesan ne likhaa he ki vico kii giraftaar ke vakt raajnneetik dalon kii kya pratikriya tha
 The members of the opposition were calling it an abuse of law but the members of the ruling NDA could not take a clean stand
 vico endie kaa hissaa the
 Neither condemning the abuse nor welcoming the arrest
 vico ne kaha tha ki pota vidheyak laane ke liye endie ke saath vot karnaa meri raajnneetik galatiyon main se ek thi
 The Congress had justified the decision to impose POTA
 vaajapeyi sarkaar ke kanoon mantri ke taur par janaa krishnamurthi ne kaha tha ki isamen centre kaa role nahin he
 Law and order is a matter of state
 is cese ko lekar kaaphi bahes hui thi
 You can read old news
 ye ghatnaayen bataa rahi hai ki pota kaa durupyog hua karata tha
 The Hindu is reported on 14 March 2003
 tab ke grahamantri adwani ne loksabhaa main bayaan diya tha ki ek rivyuu cameti banaai ja rahi he jo dekhegi ki pota kaa durupyog to nahin ho rahaa he
 The committee will see that it is not being used against the accused of general offense under this law
 grahamantri amit shah daawey se kah sakate hai ki pota kaa durupyog nahin hua lekin durupyog kis kanoon kaa nahin hua

 supreme court ne sabooton ke abhaav main bari kar diya
 Till date, it is not known what action was taken against those arrested on the wrong charges

 Quaidly the media should tell that they were misused by Pota or Tada but TV will show you the contention of Amit Shah and Owaisi and will make you excited
 aap internet par jaakar nisaar kii story padhiega
 Muzamil Jalil of the Indian Express wrote
 nitya ramakrishnan ne nisaar kaa cese ladaa tha
 Politics first decides that no case will be fought against such accused
 sochie, koi cese na lade to kitne aise begunaah aatank ke aarope main sad jaaenge
 There should be action on terror, but the agency should be such that if steps are taken then it should be taken with confidence
 na ki kisi ko uthaakar yakeen paidaa kare

 Thankfully, the 'gail Storm' came first and Team India got a chance to rebuild its strategy
 pehle do match main kris gail kaa balla nahin chalaa to aalochak unhen kaarij karne main lag gaye
 Even the West Indies Cricket Board chief Dave Cameron criticized him by tweeting
 mashhoor cartoonist praan ke comics main chachaa choudhary ke sahaayak or jupiter grah se aae sabu ko jab gussa aata he to kahin jwalamukhi footataa he
 Christopher Henry Gayle is no less than Sabu in terms of deal and personality
 pichley hafte mangalvaar ko canberra main zimbabwe par gail kaa gussa phuta, to ranon or record aag ke gole kii tarah baras rahe the
 Gayle became the first player to score a double century in the World Cup with 215 runs off 147 balls
 ye vanade kaa sabase tej doharaa shatak he
 He partnered 372 runs with Marlon Samuels, which is a new world record in odis
 pari main 16 chakke maar rohit sharma or abi divilliars kii barabari kii
 If fans of Sachin Tendulkar call him the 'god' of cricket, then Gayle has been named 'godzilla' for his stormy innings
 zimbabwe ke kilaaf match ke baad gail ne kaha, 'world cap jaise bade toornament main aap ko saath or hausala afajaai kii zarurat hoti he
 If everyone gets along, the performance can be even stronger
 ' In view of course is their attitude and made the team will set the strategy renewed
 shuukravaar ko perth main bharat kaa saamana westeindies se hoga to team india kii pehali koshish hogi kris gail ko jaldi out karne kii
 Gayle's weakness has been playing spin bowlers
 267 vanade main 44 baar ve spinners kaa shikaar hue hai
 It is quite possible that Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja will be able to bowl out captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Gayle quickly
 chalo maan lete hai ki bhartiya gendbaaz gail ko jaldi out kar lete hai
 But listen to Clive Lloyd carefully
 do baar westeindies ko world champion banane vaale karishmai captain or apane jamaane ke dhakad ballebaaz clive loyad westeindies ke mukhya chayankarta hai
 His words cannot be ignored in this way
 loyad kaa kahana he ki caribbian team sirf gail par nirbhar nahin hai
 There are other players in his team who can turn the match
 baat main dam he
 It is expected that Dhoni and company do not let all their strength go to Gayle alone
 yaad rakhie
 When the Gayle storm was going on in Canberra, another batsman scored a brilliant century in the other end
 marlan sampuls ne bagaiyr out hue 156 gendon par 133 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 Lyndal Simmons of Ireland scored 102 and Darren Sammy scored 89
 pakistan ke kilaaf bhi simons kaa balla koob chalaa tha
 Simmons contributed 50 and Dinesh Ramdin contributed 51 runs
 vahiin dakshin africa ke kilaaf captain jesan holder ne 56 ran banaae the
 That is, one of his batsmen is scoring runs in every match
 agar do ballebaaz bada score bana len to team india ko mushkil ho sakati he
 As for bowling, Jerram Taylor took 3-3 wickets in the first three matches
 ireland pakistan or zimbabwe ke kilaaf 3-3 wicket lene ke baad perth kii pich par bhartiya ballebaazon ko pareshaan kar sakate hai

 kya sangh unke shaareerik bedaulapan ko bhi lekar sharminda hone lagegaa? kya 'saise zero sanghee' ko hi shakha ke liye yogya mana jayega? After this came the practice of half-pants with good tailoring and fitting
 inhen shats kaha jane laga
 His color was also of Khaki, but no one saw that he was the leader of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 balki aise kaaki shats hamane sabase pehle left ke vidwaanon ko hi pahane dekha! bade bade brands vaale store main shats ko jagah milane lagi
 People started appearing here wearing shaats
 chuttee ke dinon main shats or flotor pahanakar logon ne khushi khushi jataa diya ki ve bharat kii ateet vaali tamaam arthvyavasthaaon se sambandh viched karne main sankoch nahin karte
 a large number of people started wearing shaats at the airport and railway station
 kuch logon ne goa ko shats kii rajdhani samajha or goa jane se pehle shats kii karidaari jarur kii
 On the train going to Patna, people started appearing in T-shirts and shaats, but the rest of the ride saw them as hybrid (mixed) citizens
 shats main dekhte lagata tha ki bodh gaya jane vaala koi videshi to nahin magar shakl se bihari jaanakar sadma lag jaataa tha
 The antiquarians used to think that it was over
 nabbe ke dashak main ham jis bihar se aae the vahaan log neeche half pant nahin pahante the
 This is the situation even today
 log neeche se nahin upar se half yaa saaf ho jate hai
 People of our state (bengal and eastern Uttar Pradesh too) like to wear less on summer days
 garmi ke dinon main lagata he ki sari qamizen kahaan chali jaati hongi
 Chemise and trousers are not removed as soon as they come home
 log lungi kaa gheraa kasate hue mohalle ke bich main aa jate the
 For example, going to office is a punishment for wearing trousers
 jaldi se log baniyaan main aa jate the
 In summer, people from Bengal and Bihar wear vest which we in English call Ganji
 har koi apni ganji ko pehle din ke jaisaa safed rakhana chahta he
 If you fail to keep the ganji white, then you start turning blue from indigo
 main iskaa bhi vaigyanik kaaran nahin pataa laga sakaa ki logon ko nile main safed kaise nazar aata he
 In the end, when every vest has to be blue, then why does the blue vest not sell
 sabase zyaada safed kyon bikta he
 i do not know the origin of the parents of half pants but it seems that in India it came as a trouser and half trouser in the era of British rule
 british afasar or sipaahi donon half pant pahante the
 Half pants have become popular in our country with children's school uniforms
 zyaadaatar half pant ful pant se hi paidaa hote the
 When full pants were small, the house became a half pants for anyone in the family
 orjinal half pant kii silaai kam hoti thi isliye behtareen half pant silne vaale kam hi hue hai
 Dhoti and lungi seem to be Indian type according to culture
 amir or madhyamvargeey tabake main inhen koi poochne vaala nahin he
 People there are now wearing track pants! rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne apane khaaki half pant ko badalakar ab phul kar diya he, jo bhure rang kaa hoga
 At a time when Nekar / Shaats are more popular and cool, Sangh has changed its original dress at the same time
 jabatak koi bacchon ke alaava nekar nahin pahentaa tha tab tak sangh vaale pahante rahe
 Now that everyone is wearing it, why are they feeling ashamed! Is it because people are making fun of him? The joke must have flown even earlier
 twitor par maine dekha ki kai log nekar ko lekar tarah tarah kii tasviren post kar rahe hai
 The opposition to the Sangh is understandable, but i do not like it to cry in protest
 kya ye log saare half pant ke bare main vahi raay rakhte hai jo sangh ke nekar ke bare main rakhte hai? sangh ke saare virdohi saste main chhot janaa chaahate hai
 Some start having fun protesting on symbolic issues
 sangh kaa virodh karnaa he to uske bare main jaaniye, samay nikaal kar padhiye
 Work as hard as the Sangh works for its expansion
 sangh kaa sanghathan yaa uski vichaardhaara half pant main nahin hai
 The comments ardh- patalun ( half pant angreji he, patalun?) kaa mazaaq uda rahe hai yaa uski kharaab fitting kaa? mujhe nahin pataa ki sangh ke kaaryakartaaon ko mukhyalay se half pant kii supplai hoti he yaa ve jahaan tahaan se silava lete hai
 As i said, basically the tailors that sew the half pants are less, so the fitting has become so tight
 is kami ko aasaani se dur kiya ja saktaa he
 The Sangh can learn from Khadi
 khaadi ke kapadon kii karaab fitting kii samasya dur kar faishneble banaaya gaya he
 In my opinion, the decision to change the half pants and its color is the defeat of the Sangh
 uski patibaddhta kii haar he
 Even if Necker is not a symbol of his ideology, but he is also of commitment
 aakhir sangh un logon ko kya jawaab degaa jo varshon se usee badrang or kharaab fitting vaale nikar main shakha lagaate rahe
 Will the Sangh be embarrassed about their physical unrest? Will 'size Zero Sanghi' be considered eligible for the branch? chuttee ke dinon main shats or flotor pahanakar logon ne khushi khushi jataa diya ki ve bharat kii ateet vaali tamaam arthvyavasthaaon se sambandh viched karne main sankoch nahin karte

 This is the situation even today
 log neeche se nahin upar se half yaa saaf ho jate hai
 People of our state (bengal and eastern Uttar Pradesh too) like to wear less on summer days
 garmi ke dinon main lagata he ki sari qamizen kahaan chali jaati hongi
 Chemise and trousers are not removed as soon as they come home
 log lungi kaa gheraa kasate hue mohalle ke bich main aa jate the
 For example, going to office is a punishment for wearing trousers
 jaldi se log baniyaan main aa jate the
 In summer, people from Bengal and Bihar wear vest which we in English call Ganji

 Everyone wants to keep their ganji as white as the day before
 ganji ko safed rakh paane kii naakaami yaa sadma nahin jhel pate hai to nil se nila karne lagate hai
 i also could not find a scientific reason for how people see white in blue
 ant main jab har baniyaan ko nila hi hona he to nila baniyaan hi kyon nahin bikta
 Why is white sold the most
 mujhe half pant ke maa-baap yani mul kaa pataa nahin lekin lagata he ki bharat main yah bartania hukumat ke daur main patalun or half patalun banakar aayaa
 Both British officers and soldiers wore half pants
 hamaare desh main half pant bacchon ke skool uniform se prachlit hua he
 Most half pants originated from full pants
 ful pant chota hote hi ghar parivaar main kisi ke liye half pant ban jaataa tha
 Original half pants were less stitched, so the best half pants are less stitched
 samskruti ke hisaab se dhoti or lungi bhartiya tip lagati he
 There is no one to ask them in the rich and middle class
 vahaan log ab trek pant pahanane lage hai! The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has changed its khaki half pants to full, which will be brown
 ek aise samay main jab nekar / shats zyaada prachlit he or kool he thik usee samay sangh ne apane is mul vastra ko badal diya he
 As long as no one wore a necklace other than children, the Sanghis kept wearing it
 ab jab sab pahanane lage hai to unhen kyon laaj aa rahi he! kya isliye ki log mazaaq udaane lage hai? mazaaq to pehle bhi udata hoga
 On Twitter, i saw many people posting different pictures about Necker
 sangh kaa virodh to samaj aata he lekin virodh main sanakna mujhe kool nahin lagata
 Do these people have the same opinion about all the half pants that the Sankar's necker has? All the opponents of the Sangh want to be discounted cheaply
 kuch pratikaatmak masalon par virodh jataakar mouj karne lagate hai
 If you want to oppose the Sangh then know about it, take the time and read it
 utani mehnat kijiye jitani mehnat sangh apane prasar ke liye karata he
 The organization or ideology of the Sangh is not in the half pants
 tippaniyan mocking half-trousers (half pants is English, trousers?) Or its ill-fitting? i do not know whether the Sangh workers supply half pants from the headquarters or where they get sewn from there
 jaisaa ki maine kaha ki mul rup se half pant silne vaale darzi kam hote hai isliye fitting kii aisi taisi ho gai he
 This deficiency can be easily overcome
 sangh khaadi se sikh saktaa he
 Khadi clothing has been made fashionable by removing the problem of bad fitting
 meri raay main half pant or uskaa rang badalane kaa faisalaa sangh kii haar he
 His commitment is defeated
 bhale hi nekar uski vichaardhaara kaa pratik nahin he lekin patibaddhta kaa to he hi
 After all, how will the Sangh respond to those who have been branching out in the same battered and poorly fitting niches for years
 kya sangh unke shaareerik bedaulapan ko bhi lekar sharminda hone lagegaa? kya 'saise zero sanghee' ko hi shakha ke liye yogya mana jayega? i do not know the origin of the parents of half pants but it seems that in India it came as a trouser and half trouser in the era of British rule

 kya sangh unke shaareerik bedaulapan ko bhi lekar sharminda hone lagegaa? kya 'saise zero sanghee' ko hi shakha ke liye yogya mana jayega? Former Rajya Sabha MP and leader of Jamiat ulema-e-hind, Mahmood Madani, has said that in Islam religion the doors are not closed for reconciliation or individual
 haalanki unhone saaf kiya he ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke liye aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa kyonki 2002 dangon ke baad unki taraf se koi koshish nahin dikhti or na hi maafee kii pahal hui he
 Taking a dig at Narendra Modi, he said, "after what happened in Gujarat, expecting Muslims to forget it is absolutely wrong
" ham logon se kisi ko maaf karne yaa bhul jane kii apil kyon karen, jab unhen hamaare samarthan kii jarurat nahin he
 He has accused Modi of trying to heal the wounds of the 2002 riots
 ek baar bhi samvaad kii koshish nahin kii gai
 On the question of apology, he said, 'forgiveness will be a good start
 jo hua or jis tarah ke kadam uthaae gaye, wo galat tha
 But forgiveness should be offered by them
 'mahmud madani ne kaha, 'yah muslim tay nahin karegaa ki wo modi ke saath kis tarah kaa rishta chahta he, balki modi ko apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani hogi
 But we are hearing from them that they do not need us
 hamen unase koi ummid nahin he or na hi unhen hamase koi ummid he
 Regarding the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, he said, 'muslim voters will vote for different parties in different states
 ' par unhone yah bhi mana he ki kuch rajyon main ve kisi party vishesh ko haraane ke liye vot daalenge
 On the other hand, Madani raised the UP government in the dock for the Muzaffarnagar riots and demanded the dismissal of the Akhilesh government
 unhone kaha ki upi ke mukhyamantri anubhavheen hai
 He did not take appropriate steps to stop the riots

 Subhranshu was suspended for tarnishing the party's image
 loksabhaa chunaav se kaaphi samay pehle mukul roy trinmul congress chhodkar bijepi main shaamil ho gaye the
 Lack of discipline within the party and not listening to the leaders are also considered as reasons for the split in Trinamool
 arjuna singh jaise log jo bijepi main shaamil ho gaye or ab saansad ban gaye hai, ve kabhi saansad bananaa chaahate the lekin trinmul ne unke naam par gaur nahin kiya, isliye unhone party chhod di
 There are other people who are feeling trapped in the Trinamool and are leaving the party

 What can you expect that the leaders will debate for three days in the winter session, just like the Constitution and tolerance paddy, in the same way as the stifling air of Delhi and the flood of Chennai
 sansad kaa record dekhne ke baad ummid nahin jagati ki der raat tak sansad chalaakar ladgaye vaale netaa, badmijaaj mausam se jeevika va jindagi ko bachaane vaali gavarnence par aisi gambhir bahes karenge
 Parliamentary debates like ostrich heads sunken in the sands of the past show that the level of modernity is low in the politics of the world's largest democracy
 bharat main to green politics kii aamad ek dashak pehle tak ho jaani chahie thi jab mausami badlaav jaanaleva ho chale the
 Now that the world is facing strong economic and political promises about the environment, the environmental impoverishment of our political debates has become more vocal
 europe main green politics ne darasal vampanthi dalon kii jagah bhari he
 New environmental politics emerged in Europe in the 1980s and became highly effective by the early 1990s
 chunaavon main green partiyon ne badi safalataa nahin hasil kii par yah partiyaan paryaavaran ko surakshit rakhane kii nitiyon kii himaayat ke saath kramshah rajnatik, saamaajik or aarthik agenda tay karne lageen
 The 'green Left' extremist urges were sent many times but this politics had the effect of green tax, clean energy, congestion tax in cities, high price for luxurious living, Europe's law on safe trade for nature and today The rules are more modern than in America
 agar aapako hairat na hui to ab honi chahie ki samvidhan diwas kii bahes main jab sabhi dal apane-apane ambedkar chune rahe the or congress or bijepi kaa idia of india ek duusare se gutthamguttha the, thik us samay pradhanmantri ke daftar main paris paryaavaran sammelan ko lekar bharat kii vachanabaddhataon ko antim rup diya ja rahaa tha
 Parliament has not even tried to know how the agreement that India is about to reduce carbon emissions will affect the lives of the country's population
 India has promised the world that it will reduce its environmental heating carbon emissions by 33 to 35 percent by 2020
 yah bahut bada vaada he jisaki aarthik-rajnatik laagat bhi badi hogi kyonki iske baad saaf suthri bijli se lekar har jagah nai takneekon kii jarurat hogi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi returned to Paris, weather anger in Chennai also shook but India's leaders could not get into life and death debates perhaps because there is no chapter of modern green politics in their political studies
 dilli kaa smog isi saal nahin paidaa hua
 But the question never emerged in political forums that what would be the immediate and long term strategy to change the climate of cities? When the court cracked the whip, Kejriwal, who asked the public to do everything, issued a decree to remove half the cars from the road for three days a week on just fifteen days notice
 duniya ke zyaadaatar shaharon main yah vyavastha isliye aajamaai nahin gai kyonki vahaan kii raajnneeti ne un vikalpon par charchaa kii thi jo kam se kam asuvidha main janata ko paryaavaran ke prati samvedansheel banaate the
 If Green Politics had been active in India, we would have been discussing the imposition of congestion tax in Delhi, prohibiting parking, raising more than one car, raising revenue on diesel cars and raising urban transport and not closing the cars
 They were preparing to deal with the absurd decisions
 tab hamaari bahasein yah hotin ki clin energy ses yaa svachh bharat ses kaa istemaal aakhir kahaan ho rahaa he?siyasat ke pongapanth par shaq nahin he lekin naseehaton ko lekar asamvedansheeltaa zyada pareshaan karti he
 In the last decade, major debates or decisions of modern politics and governance have not arisen from the stage of traditional politics of the country
 bharat main paryaavaran ko lekar gavarnence ko badalane kii shuruyaat swayamsevi sansthaaon or adaalaton kii jugalbandi se hoti he, kisi rajnatik dal ke andolan se nahin
 Western democracies are just the opposite
 vahaan paryaavaran ke nuksaan bharat jaise mulkon kii tulana main kam hai phir bhi unhone rajnatik andolanon ke jariye paryaavaran ko raajnneeti ke centre main sthapit kiya
 Even the non-political and volunteer activism which was seen in India about the environment, the new government stopped it
 aabhohawaa kii durustagi par agar, adaalatein na sakriy hon to bharat ke netaa, itihaas main badlaav par jujh jaaenge lekin damaghont vartmaan ko badalane par sakriy nahin honge
 Now almost every policy of India's future has to be directly or indirectly influenced by the environment
 aane vaale kuch hi varshon main shahar banane se lekar bijli sanyantr lagane, kaaron ke utpaadan se unke istemaal tak, bimariyon se ladaai ke intjaam se lekar kheti tak or tex, niryaat, aayaat tak lagbhag sabhi nitiyon main jalwaayu parivartan va paryaavaran ke sandarbh mukhar hone vaale hai, jo jindagi jeene kii laagat va tarika badalenge
 There are two types of threats posed by the limited understanding and activism of the leaders about green governance
 One is that due to court or international decisions, we may suddenly fall for life-changing or costly decisions, such as reducing the number of cars in Delhi
 Has taken place
 or doosraa-hamen shaayad dhundh yaa pani main doobane ke liye chhod diya jayega
 In order to deal with the challenge of the environment, we need a modern politics which is not even at the central level, it has not even got the seed in the politics of the states
